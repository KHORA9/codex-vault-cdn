Not one spoke.\r\n\r\n“That’s not the way to go about it,” said Bart. “It isn’t parliamentary.\r\nLet’s do business regularly. Come. I rise, Mr. President, to make a\r\nmotion. I move that the B. O. W. C. continue their wanderings as long as\r\nthe holidays last.”\r\n\r\n“I second that motion,” cried Phil.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Bruce, “it has been moved and seconded that the B. O.\r\nW. C. continue their wanderings as long as the holidays last. All that\r\nare in favor of this motion will please manifest it by saying, ‘Ay.’”\r\n\r\nAt this there was a universal chorus of “Ay.”\r\n\r\n“Contrary minds, ‘No.’”\r\n\r\nSilence followed.\r\n\r\n“It’s a vote,” said Bruce; “and now all that remains to do is to decide\r\nupon the direction to be taken.”\r\n\r\nUpon this Captain Corbet smiled benignly, and a glance of approval\r\nbeamed from his venerable eye. Old Solomon grinned violently, but\r\nchecked himself in a moment; his grin was drowned in a low chuckle, and\r\nhe exclaimed, “De sakes now, chil’en alive, how you do go on! Mos’ make\r\ndis ole nigga bust hisself to see dese yer mynouvrins.”.\r\n\r\n“Look here, boys,” cried Bart, suddenly dropping altogether the\r\n“parliamentary” style in which he had last spoken; “what do you say to a\r\ncruise around the gulf? Let’s visit the islands; there are ever so many;\r\nsome of them are uninhabited, too. It’ll be glorious!”\r\n\r\n“Glorious--will it?” cried Tom. “Wait, my boy, till you know as much\r\nabout uninhabited islands as I do. You don’t catch me putting my foot\r\nashore on anything of that sort.”\r\n\r\n“O, well, we needn’t be particular about the inhabitants,” said Arthur.\r\n“I go in for islands, head over heels.”\r\n\r\n“So do I,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“Be the powers,” said Pat, “but it’s meself that howlds up both hands to\r\nthat same.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose we go to the Magdalen Islands,” said Bruce. “They’re right in\r\nthe middle of the gulf, and it’s a very queer place, they say.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Bart; “if we go anywhere, let’s go to Anticosti. For my\r\npart, I’ve always been wild to go to Anticosti. I don’t believe there’s\r\nanother island in all the world that’s equal to it. It’s cold, bleak,\r\ngloomy, uninhabited, and full of ghosts.”\r\n\r\n“Full of fiddlesticks!” exclaimed Arthur. “What do you want of ghosts?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bart, placidly, “for my part, I think there is something\r\nuncommonly interesting in a haunted island.”\r\n\r\n“A haunted island!” repeated Arthur. “Well, my boy, all I’ve got to\r\nsay is, that if you want anything of that sort, you’ll find the best\r\nspecimen on Sable Island; so I propose that we go there at once.”\r\n\r\n“Sable Island? Why, man alive, that’s ever so far away!” said Tom. “We’d\r\nbetter wait till we’re on our way home, and leave that for the last;\r\nthough, for my part, I think we’d better give it a wide berth. I go in\r\nfor some of the gulf islands--St. Paul, for instance, or St. Peter.”\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said Phil, “since you’re all so crazy about islands, why\r\ncan’t we go to the Bay of Islands at once? We can have our fill of them\r\nthere, I should think. For my part I’m indifferent. I’m like Tom;\r\nI’ve had my turn at a desert island, and have found out the vanity of\r\nRobinson Crusoe.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, thin,” said Pat, “and whin we’re about it, we’d betther take the\r\nbiggist island we can find about here, and that same is Newfoundland.\r\nWouldn’t it be betther to begin with that, thin?”\r\n\r\n“The fact is, boys,” said Bruce, with the air of a judge or an umpire,\r\n“we’ll have to make up our minds to visit all these islands. Each one\r\nhas his preference, and each one shall be gratified. You, Bart, may see\r\nAnticosti; you, Arthur, may see Sable Island; you, Tom, may visit St.\r\nPaul and St. Peter; you, Phil, may visit the Bay of Islands; and at the\r\nsame time you, Pat, may see Newfoundland. Of course, then, I hope to go\r\nto the Magdalen Islands. Now, as we are going to visit all these places,\r\nand the Magdalen Islands happen to be nearest, we will take them first,\r\nwhile we may visit in turn Anticosti and the others, winding up with\r\nSable Island, which may be postponed to the last, since it is the\r\nfarthest off. We may make up our minds, boys, to no end of adventures.\r\nWe’re all in first-rate training; we are hardened by adventures on sea\r\nand on shore; we can live on next to nothing; and I’m only sorry that\r\nwe’re not a little nearer to the North Pole, so that we might set out\r\nnow as we are to settle the question forever about the open Polar Sea.”\r\n\r\nThe extravagant notion with which Bruce closed his address was\r\nreceived with shouts of laughter and applause. Then followed a confused\r\nconversation. At length they all gathered around Captain Corbet, who had\r\nthus far been a listener, and began to question him about the various\r\nplaces which they proposed to visit. The answer of the venerable\r\nnavigator was not very satisfactory.\r\n\r\n“Wal, boys,” said he, “you put me down in any part of old Fundy, an I’m\r\nto hum; anywhar’s between the head of old Fundy an Bosting, I know it\r\nall be heart; an I engage to feel my way in fog or in darkness, or in\r\nsnow-storms, backard an forard, year on an year on; but jest about here\r\nI’m all agog. In these here parts I’m a pilgerrim an a stranger, an\r\nain’t particularly to be trusted. But I can navigate the Antelope all\r\nthe same, an fool round in these waters as long as you like. I ain’t\r\ngot any chart, terrew; but I’ve got an old map of Canady, an kin scrape\r\nalong with that, especially this season of the year. I kin git a ginral\r\nleadin idee of the position of places, an work along the old Antelope\r\nwharever you want to go. I’m an old man myself, an don’t mind this\r\nkerrewsing a bit; in fact, it’s rayther agree’ble. The best of it is,\r\nwe’re allus sure to fetch up some-whar.”\r\n\r\nThis frank announcement of Captain Corbet’s ignorance of these seas\r\nmight have excited disquietude in the bosoms of less enterprising\r\nlads; but the cruisers of the Antelope had seen and known, and felt\r\nand suffered, too much to be easily disturbed. Of Captain Corbet’s\r\nconfession they thought nothing whatever, nor indeed did it really\r\nmatter very much to them whether he was acquainted with these waters\r\nor not. After all, they were not particular about any destination; any\r\nmistakes which he might make would not create any inconvenience to them;\r\nand even if, in seeking to reach Newfoundland, he should land them\r\nat Cape Cod, they would not much care. Under these circumstances\r\nthey listened to his words with indifference, and if they felt any\r\ndisappointment, it was because they were unable to gain from him any\r\ninformation whatever about the places which they proposed to visit.\r\n\r\nSince they could gain no information, they did not waste much more time\r\nin conversation, but concluded to set out without delay. And so in a\r\nlittle while the Antelope spread her white wings, and began to walk\r\nthe waters in her usual style, like a thing of life, and all that. In\r\nprocess of time she reached the entrance of the bay, and then passed out\r\ninto the gulf.\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious day. The wind was fair. The Antelope did her best. The\r\nsun went down that evening behind the high hills, and before them lay a\r\nwide expanse of water. On the following morning they saw land ahead.\r\nThe land was an island, or a cluster of islands, and all the boys felt\r\ncertain that it was the Magdalen Islands.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Captain Corbet’s ignorance of the Gulf of St. Lawrence,\r\nhe had chosen his course very accurately, for this was indeed their\r\ndestination. As the schooner drew nearer and nearer, the boys looked\r\nwith curious eyes upon this remote and isolated spot, situated in the\r\nmidst of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and shut out during all the winter\r\nmonths from the rest of the world of man by ice, and storms, and\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\nThe wind died away after sunrise, and hours passed before they came near\r\nenough to think of landing. At length the anchor was dropped, and the\r\nboat was made ready to go ashore. From this point they could see this\r\nnew land to the best advantage. They saw before them an island rising\r\nhigh out of the water, with its green slopes covered with grass, and\r\ncrowned with trees, and dotted with white houses. Before them there\r\nwere a cove and a sandy beach, upon which boats were drawn up. The\r\nother islands of the group were shut out from view by this one. Not\r\nfar away--in fact, not farther than a stone’s throw--there lay another\r\nschooner at anchor. Very different was this other schooner from the\r\nAntelope. The Antelope, in spite of its many admirable and amiable\r\nqualities, was not particularly distinguished either for size, or\r\nstrength, or speed, or beauty. In every one of these particulars the\r\nother schooner was the exact opposite. It was large; it was evidently\r\nnew; its lines were sharp and delicate, indicating great speed; its\r\nspread of canvas was immense; it was a model of naval architecture;\r\nwhile the freshness of its paint, and the extreme neatness which\r\nappeared in every part, indicated a far greater care on the part of its\r\nmaster than any which the good and gracious Corbet was ever disposed\r\nto exhibit towards his beloved Antelope. On high floated the Stars and\r\nStripes, exhibiting the nationality of the stranger. On her stern the\r\nboys could read her name and nation. They saw there, in white letters\r\nunderneath a gold eagle, the words,--\r\n\r\n\r\nFAWN-GLOUCESTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n“On land,” said Bruce, gravely, as he looked at the strange craft, “the\r\nAntelope and the Fawn are somewhat alike; but on the sea it strikes me\r\nthat there is a slight difference.”\r\n\r\nThe other boys said nothing, but there arose involuntarily in the mind\r\nof each a feeling not exactly of envy, but at least a fervent wish that\r\nthe resemblance which Bruce spoke of should exist on the water as well\r\nas on the land.\r\n\r\n“I suppose it’s a yacht,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Or a cruiser,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Nothin of the kind,” said Captain Corbet. “That thar craft ain’t\r\nanythin more than a Gloucester fishing schewner.”\r\n\r\n“A fishing schooner?”\r\n\r\n“Course; an why not? Why, them Gloucester skippers make themselves\r\ncomfortable; they know how to do it, tew, an this chap is jest like the\r\nrest. He makes himself comfortable, keeps his schewner like a palace or\r\na parlor, an don’t let even so much as the scale of a red herrin be seen\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\nThe boys went ashore in the boat. Bruce then returned for Captain\r\nCorbet, who was touched by this small attention. As Bart and the rest\r\nwaited on the beach, they noticed a small, neat, freshly-painted boat\r\ndrawn up not far away, which needed not the name of Fawn on the stern\r\nto assure them that it could belong to nothing else than the smart\r\nschooner. While they were looking at it and admiring it, a man advanced\r\ntowards them, who regarded them with a puzzled and curious expression.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of middle age and medium stature, with clean-shaven face,\r\nclose-cut hair, and keen gray eye. He wore a dark-blue frock coat and\r\nwide-awake hat, and did not seem at all like a seaman; yet somehow the\r\nboys could not help feeling that this very neatly-dressed man must have\r\nsomething to do with the Fawn. He came up to them, and looked at them\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\n“Who in thunder are you, anyhow?” he exclaimed, at length. “I can’t make\r\nyou out at all. You belong to that queer-looking tub out there, I see;\r\nbut who you are and what you are after is beyond me.”\r\n\r\nThis style of address struck the boys as being rather uncivil; but the\r\ngood-natured expression of the stranger’s face showed that no incivility\r\nwas meant, and won their hearts at once.\r\n\r\n“O, well,” said Bart, with a laugh, “you must never judge by\r\nappearances, you know. We’re not a fishing vessel. In fact, we’re a sort\r\nof chartered yacht, though we’re a very unpretending sort of yacht, and\r\nwe don’t go in for show. We’re a schooner, cruising about in a plain,\r\noff-hand, homely manner for pleasure, and all that sort of thing.”\r\n\r\nAt this the stranger burst into a shout of laughter, which was so\r\ncheery, and so hearty, and so good-natured, that the boys found it\r\nimpossible to resist its contagion, and at length they all joined in\r\nalso, though why they were laughing, or what they were laughing at, they\r\nhad not the smallest idea in the world.\r\n\r\n“Look here, boys,” exclaimed the stranger, at length, as soon as he had\r\nrecovered from his laughter; “excuse me, but I can’t help it. I’ll knock\r\nunder. I cave in. I don’t understand it at all. Have you a looking-glass\r\naboard your tub out there? Has any one of you any idea what he looks\r\nlike? Or have you ever examined one another?”\r\n\r\nAt this the boys could not help looking at one another, and at\r\nthemselves, and at this survey they began to perceive what they had not\r\nat all suspected--that they were one and all a most disreputable-looking\r\ncrowd. Their clothes were torn and stained with mud, and gave signs in\r\nevery seam and fibre of long scrambles through wood and water, and long\r\nstruggles with the elements. But, in fact, no one of them had thought\r\nof this until this moment, when they found themselves confronted and\r\nlaughed at by this well-dressed stranger.\r\n\r\n“It ain’t the shabbiness,” cried the stranger, “that upsets me, but\r\nit’s the contrast--such faces looking at me out of such clothes! Do your\r\nmothers know you are out? or, in other words, boys, do your parents know\r\nthe particular way in which you are moving about the world?”\r\n\r\n“O, well,” said Bart, “we’re not a vain vessel, you know. We’re only a\r\nplain, simple, matter-of-fact potato schooner, out for a holiday, and on\r\nthe lookout for a little fun. We’re not proud, and so, perhaps, being\r\na potato schooner, it’s just as well not to be too particular about\r\nclothes. We’ve always been told not to think too much about dress; and\r\nbesides, this sort of thing is ever so much more convenient for roughing\r\nit, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said the stranger, “I dare say you looked very well when\r\nyou started; and after all, clothes are not the most important thing. At\r\nany rate, I’m glad to meet you! How d’ye do, all? I’m glad to see you!\r\nHow d’ye do? I’d like to know you. My name’s Ferguson, Tobias Ferguson,\r\nand I’m skipper of that there craft, the Fawn.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he shook hands with every one of the boys in succession,\r\nasked their names, their ages, their place of abode, the names,\r\noccupations, and ages of their parents, and then proceeded to inquire\r\nabout their adventures thus far, and their intentions in the future.\r\nBy this time Bruce had returned from the vessel with Captain Corbet, to\r\nwhom Ferguson at once made himself known; and thus in a short time he\r\nhad come to be on intimate terms with all the party.\r\n\r\n“I just dropped in here to Magdalen,” said he, frankly, “to fix up the\r\nFawn a bit. ’Tain’t much of a place, any ways. The people air a lot\r\nof beggarly, frog-eating Frenchmen, that follow fashions as old as Adam.\r\nWhen Adam delved and Eve span, as the old verse says, they had a plough\r\nand a spindle, and that thar identical plough and spindle air still in\r\nuse here among these here French. You can’t make em use anythin else.\r\nWhy, I’ve been here dozens of times, and I’ve tried, to get em to give\r\nup their old-fashioned ways, and be up to the age. I’ve showed em our\r\nway of doin things. No go. Not a mite of use. Might as well talk to a\r\nstone wall. They’ll never get out of the old rut. And see what they’re\r\ndoin here! Why, only look around you! Magdalen Islands! Why, this\r\nlocality is one of the most favored on this green earth. In the middle\r\nof this gulf, right in the track of ships, it is in a position to enter\r\nupon a career of progress that might make this place one of the most\r\nflourishing in the world. They might control the whole fish trade; they\r\nmight originate new modes of fishing. Why, look at me! I’ve tried to get\r\nem to start factories, build railroads, steamboats, common schools,\r\nhotels, newspapers, electric telegraphs, and other concomitants of our\r\nnineteenth century civilization. And what’s the result? Why, nothing. I\r\nmight as well talk to the wind. Railroads! electric telegraphs! Why, you\r\nmight as well ask them to build a bridge to the moon! Well, all I can\r\nsay is, that these here Magdalen Islands won’t ever be anythin till they\r\nfall in with the sperrit of the age. Them’s my sentiments.”\r\n\r\n“Railroads!” cried Bart. “Why, what could they do with a railroad?”\r\n\r\n“Do?” exclaimed Ferguson. “Why, develop their resources, promote trade,\r\nfacilitate intercourse, and keep themselves abreast with the age.”\r\n\r\n“But there are not more than a couple of thousand people on the\r\nislands,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Well, what’s the odds? So much the more reason for them to be up and\r\ndoin,” retorted Ferguson, with some warmth. “They’re all as poor as\r\nrats; and a railroad is the only thing that can save them from eventooly\r\ndyin out.”\r\n\r\nThe boys looked at the stranger in some perplexity, for they did not\r\nknow whether he’ could really be in earnest or not. But from Ferguson’s\r\nface and manner they could gather nothing whatever. He seemed perfectly\r\nserious, and altogether in earnest.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” he repeated, emphatically, “these here Magdalen Islands’ll\r\nnever be wuth anythin till they get a railroad. Them’s my sentiments.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_A new Acquaintance,--The Islands of the Sea,--Making Friends,--The\r\nNatives,--A Festival,--Efforts at Conversation in an unknown Tongue,\r\n--Corbet’s Baby Talk,--Experiments of Bart and Tim,--Pat comes to\r\nGrief.--Overthrow of the French,--Arrival of the Skipper on the Scene,\r\n--He means Business._\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING that their new acquaintance was so very friendly, and\r\ncommunicative, and all that, the boys thought that it would be a good\r\nthing to find out from him something about the various islands which\r\nthey proposed visiting. Ferguson declared that he knew as much about\r\nthe Gulf of St. Lawrence as any man living, and could tell them all they\r\nwanted to know.\r\n\r\n“What sort of a place is St. Paul’s Island,” asked Arthur.\r\n\r\nThe skipper shook his head in silence. “Is St. Pierre worth visiting?”\r\n\r\n“Well--scarcely,” said the other.\r\n\r\n“What sort of a place is Anticosti?” asked Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Well, you’d best not go within fifty miles of that thar island.”\r\n\r\n“What sort of a place is Sable Island?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\n“Sable Island!” exclaimed the skipper, staring at them in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sable Island.”\r\n\r\n“You mean Cape Sable Island.”\r\n\r\n“No; we mean Sable Island.”\r\n\r\nThe skipper looked at them all with a solemn face.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said he, “as to visiting Sable Island, all I’ve got to\r\nsay is, I hope you’ll never begin to try it on Sable Island. Why, Sable\r\nIsland’s one of the places that seafarin’ men try never to visit, and\r\npray never to get nearer than a hundred miles to. Sable Island! Boys,”\r\n he continued, after a pause, “don’t ever speak of that again; don’t even\r\nthink of it. Give it up at once and forever. I only hope that you won’t\r\nbe brought to pay a visit there in spite of yourselves, a thing which\r\nI’m afraid you’re very likely to do if you go cruisin’ about in an\r\nold tub like that much longer. Not but what Sable Island mightn’t be\r\nimproved--that is, if the inhabitants only had any enterprise, and the\r\ngovernment that owns it was alive to the wants of the age.”\r\n\r\n“‘Inhabitants!” said Bart; “why, there’s only the keeper and his\r\nfamily.”\r\n\r\nThe skipper waved his hand.\r\n\r\n“Grant all that,” said he. “Very well. They’re a nucleus, at any rate,\r\nand can give tone and character to the future Sable Islanders. Now, what\r\nyour government ought to do with Sable Island is this. They’d ought to\r\nmake a good breakwater, first and foremost, so as to have decent harbor\r\naccommodation for passing vessels. Then they’d ought to connect it with\r\nthe main land with a submarine cable, so that the place needn’t be quite\r\nso isolated, and have regular lines of steamers runnin’ backard and\r\nforard. Well, then they ought to get up a judicious emigration scheme,\r\nand that thar island would begin to go ahead in a style that would make\r\nyou fairly open your eyes. Why, in ten years, if this plan was carried\r\nout, they’d be building a railroad,--a thing that is needed there more\r\nthan most anywheres, the island bein so uncommon long and narrow,--and\r\nthat bein done, why, Sable Island would begin to come abreast of the\r\nnineteenth century, instead of hanging back in the middle ages.”\r\n\r\nAfter some further conversation of a similar character, the skipper\r\nproposed to show the boys about the country, and introduce them to some\r\nof the “aristocracy.”\r\n\r\n“And there,” said he, “is one of them, now. It’s the priest--and a\r\nprecious fine fellow he is, any how, and no mistake. He is priest,\r\ngovernor general, magistrate, constable, policeman, Sunday school\r\nteacher, town clerk, schoolmaster, newspaper, lawyer, doctor, notary\r\npublic, census taker, and fifty other things all rolled into one. He is\r\nthe factotum of the Magdalen Islands. They come to him for everything:\r\nto baptize their infants, to marry their young couples, and to bury\r\ntheir dead. They go to mass on Sundays, and on week days they go to\r\nhim for advice and assistance in everything. He visits the sick, and\r\nadministers medicine as doctor, or extreme unction as priest. He settles\r\nall their quarrels better than any judge or jury, and there never ain’t\r\nany appeal thought of from his decision. Now, all this is what I call\r\na species of despotism,--it’s one man power, but it suits these poor\r\nbenighted frog-eatin heathen,--and, besides, it’s no more a despotism\r\nthan the father of a family exercises. It’s patriarchal--that’s what it\r\nis. It’s wonderful, too, how much honor the young people hereabouts pay\r\nto their fathers, and grandfathers, and elders genrally. I never knowed\r\nanythin like it in all my born days. Well, now, boys, mind you, all this\r\nis goin to be upset. Some day they’ll be appointin magistrates here, and\r\ndoctors will come, and lawyers; then this little community will all\r\nbe sot by the ears, and--and they’ll enter upon a career of boundless\r\nprogress. They’ll get the ballot-box, and the newspaper, and all the\r\nconcomitants of modern civilization; the present patriarchal system’ll\r\nbe played out, and the spirit of the age will reign and rule over them.”\r\n\r\nBy the time the skipper had given utterance to this, they had approached\r\nthe priest. He was a mild, venerable man, with a meek face and a genial\r\nsmile. He spoke English very well, shook hands with all, and listened to\r\nthe skipper’s explanations about their present visit.\r\n\r\n“And now, boys, I’ll leave you for the present,” said the skipper, “to\r\nthe care of Father Leblanc, who will do the honors of the island. I’ve\r\ngot to go aboard the Fawn to fix up a few things. We’ll meet again in\r\nthe course of the day.”\r\n\r\nWith these words he went down to the beach. The shabbiness of the\r\ncostume of the boys had already excited the remarks of the skipper, but\r\nthe good Father Leblanc soon saw that in spite of this they were clever\r\nand intelligent.\r\n\r\n“We do not often have,” said he, “at this place visitors above the rank\r\nof fishermen, and we have never before had any visitors like you. I can\r\nassure you a welcome, dear boys, from all the good people here. There is\r\nto be a fête to-day in honor of the marriage of two of my flock. Would\r\nyou like to go? If so, I invite you most cordially, and assure you of a\r\nwelcome.”\r\n\r\nThis unexpected invitation, thus kindly given, was accepted with\r\nundisguised eagerness; and thereupon the boys accompanied the priest,\r\nwho first of all went to his own home, where he offered them some simple\r\nrefreshments. The priest’s home was a small cottage of very unpretending\r\nexterior, and very similar to all the other cottages; but inside there\r\nwere marks of refined taste and scholarly pursuits. A few Latin and\r\nGreek classics were on a small book-shelf. There was an harmonium, with\r\nsome volumes of sacred music, and here and there were some volumes\r\nwhich were of a theological character. The entertainment of the priest\r\nconsisted of some coffee, which the boys were surprised to find,\r\nand which they afterwards unanimously pronounced to be “perfectly\r\ndelicious,” and some fresh eggs, with immaculate bread and butter.\r\n\r\nAfter chatting with the boys for about an hour, the priest announced\r\nthat it was time to start, as their destination was on the opposite side\r\nof the island. They accordingly set out at once, and walked along the\r\nslope of a hill. There was no road, but only a footpath, which served\r\nall the purposes of the Magdalen Islanders, in spite of the skipper’s\r\ntheories about a railway. On the way the priest entertained them with\r\nstories of his life on these secluded islands, of the storms of winter,\r\nof the ice blockade, of the perils of the sea, of the vast solitude\r\nof the surrounding gulf, where in winter no ship ever ventures. Yet in\r\nspite of the loneliness, he affirmed that no one here had any sense of\r\ndesolation, for it seemed to all of the inhabitants, just as it seems\r\nto the inhabitants of other countries, that this home of theirs was\r\nthe centre of the universe, and all other lands strange, and drear, and\r\nunattractive.\r\n\r\nAt length they reached their destination. It was a cottage of rather\r\nlarger size than usual, and it seemed as if the whole population of\r\nthe island had gathered here. Tables were spread in the open air, and a\r\nbarrel of cider was on tap. As they drew near they heard the sound of a\r\nfiddle, and saw figures moving about in a lively dance. Old men, young\r\nmen, women, girls, and children were all laughing, talking, dancing, or\r\nplaying. It was a scene full of a curious attractiveness, and exhibited\r\nin a striking way the irrepressible gayety that characterizes the French\r\nwherever they go.\r\n\r\nAt their approach the laughter and the dance ceased for a time, and the\r\ncompany welcomed the good priest with smiles and kindly words. The boys\r\nalso came in for a share of the hospitable welcome, and as soon as the\r\npriest had explained who they were, they were at once received as most\r\nwelcome and honored guests. Unfortunately the boys could not speak a\r\nword of French, and the people could not speak a word of English, so\r\nthat there was not that freedom of intercourse between the two parties\r\nwhich might have been desirable; but the priest did much to bring about\r\nthis interchange of feelings by acting as interpreter, and the boys also\r\nby gestures or by smiles endeavored, not without some success, to make\r\nknown their feelings for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe boys soon distributed themselves about at random, and the good\r\npeople never ceased to pay delicate little attentions to them by\r\noffering them coffee or cakes, by uttering a few words in the hope that\r\nthey might be understood, or, if words were wanting, they took refuge in\r\nsmiles. But words were not wanting, and different members of the party\r\nmade violent efforts to break through the restraints which a foreign\r\nlanguage imposed, and express their feelings more directly.\r\n\r\nThus Captain Corbet, who had accompanied the party, finding himself\r\nhospitably entertained by a smiling old Frenchman, endeavored to make\r\nknown the joy of his heart.\r\n\r\n“Coffee,” said he, tapping his cup and grinning.\r\n\r\n“Oui, oui,” said the Frenchman.\r\n\r\n“Coffee dood--pooty--nicey--O, velly nicey picey.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet evidently was falling back upon his “baby talk,” under\r\nthe impression that it would be more intelligible to a foreigner.\r\nBut this foreigner did not quite understand him. He only shrugged his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n“Cooky--cakey--nicey,” continued Captain Corbet, in, an amiable tone.\r\n“All dood--all nicey--velly.”\r\n\r\nAnd he again paused and smiled.\r\n\r\n“Plait-il?” said the Frenchman, politely.\r\n\r\n“Plate? O, no, no plate for me, an thank you kindly all the same.”\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman looked at him in a bewildered way, but still smiled.\r\n\r\n“Vouley vous du pain?” he asked, at length.\r\n\r\n“Pan?” said Captain Corbet; “pan? Course not. What’d I do with a\r\npan?--but thankin you all the same, course.”\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\n“It was a pooty ’itile tottage,” said Captain Corbet, resuming his\r\nbaby talk, “an a pooty tompany, an it was all dood--pooty--nicey.”\r\n\r\nBut the Frenchman didn’t understand a word, and so at length Captain\r\nCorbet, with a sigh, gave up the attempt.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the others were making similar endeavors. Tom had got hold of\r\na French boy about his own age.\r\n\r\n“Parley vous Français,” said Tom, solemnly.\r\n\r\n“Oui,” said the French boy.\r\n\r\n“Oui, moosoo,” said Tom.\r\n\r\nThe French boy smiled.\r\n\r\n“Merci, madame,” continued Tom, boldly.\r\n\r\nThe boy stared.\r\n\r\n“Nong--tong--paw,” proceeded Tom, in a business-like manner.\r\n\r\nOf this the boy could evidently make nothing.\r\n\r\nBut here Tom seemed to have reached the limit of his knowledge of\r\nFrench, and the conversation came to a sudden and lamentable end.\r\n\r\nBart had carried on for some time an interesting conversation with\r\nsmiles and gestures, when he too ventured into audible words.\r\n\r\n“Bon!” said he, in an impressive manner; and then touching the breast\r\nof the boy to whom he was speaking, he continued, “You--tu--you\r\nknow--you’re bon;” then, laying his hand on his heart, he said, “me\r\nbon;” then, pointing to the cup, “coffee bon;” then sweeping his hand\r\naround, he added, “and all bon--house bon, company bon, people bon.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, oui,” cried the boy. “Oui, je vous comprends. Aha, oui, la bonne\r\ncompagnie, le bon peuple--”\r\n\r\n“Bon company, bon people, bon company, bon people,” cried Bart,\r\ndelighted at his success in getting up a conversation; “bon coffee, too;\r\nI tell you what, it’s the bonnest coffee that I’ve tasted for many a\r\nlong day.”\r\n\r\nAt this the boy looked blank.\r\n\r\n“Parley vous Français?” asked Bart, in an anxious tone.\r\n\r\n“Oui,” said the boy.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I don’t,” said Bart; “but the moment I get home I intend to\r\nstudy it.”\r\n\r\nAnd at this stage Bart’s conversation broke down.\r\n\r\nPat chose another mode of accomplishing the same end. Captain Corbet had\r\nbeen acting on the theory that foreigners were like babies, and could\r\nunderstand baby talk. Pat, in addition to this, acted on the theory\r\nthat they were deaf, and had to be addressed accordingly. So, as he was\r\nrefreshing himself with coffee and cakes, he drew a little nearer to the\r\nold woman who had poured it out for him, and bent down his head. The old\r\nwoman was at that moment intent upon her coffeepot, and did not notice\r\nPat. Suddenly Pat, with his mouth close to her ear, shouted out with a\r\nperfect yell,--\r\n\r\n“Bully for you! and thank you kindly, marm!”\r\n\r\nWith a shriek of terror the startled old woman sprang up and fell\r\nbackward. The chair on which she had been sitting, a rather rickety\r\naffair, gave way and went down. The old lady fell with the chair upon\r\nthe ground, and lay for a moment motionless. Pat, horror-struck, stood\r\nconfounded, and stared in silence at the ruin he had wrought. The\r\nbystanders, alarmed at the shout and shriek, crowded around, and for\r\na moment there was universal confusion. Among the bystanders was the\r\npriest. To him Pat turned in his despair, and tried to explain. The\r\npriest listened, and then went to see about the old woman. Fortunately\r\nshe had fallen on the soft turf, and was not at all hurt. She was\r\nsoon on her feet, and another chair was procured, in which she seated\r\nherself. The priest then explained the whole affair. Pat was fully\r\nforgiven, and the harmony of the festival was perfectly restored. But\r\nPat’s laudable efforts at maintaining a conversation had received so\r\nsevere a check that he did not open his mouth for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nThe festival went on. Fun and hilarity prevailed all around. The dancing\r\ngrew more and more vigorous. At length the contagion spread to the elder\r\nones of the party, and the boys were astonished to see old men stepping\r\nforth to skip and dance about the green; then old women came forward\r\nto take a part, until, at length, all were dancing. The boys stood as\r\nspectators, until at length Bart determined to throw himself into the\r\nspirit of the scene. He therefore found a partner, and plunged into the\r\ndance. The others followed. Captain Corbet alone remained, seated near a\r\ntable, viewing the scene with his usual benevolent glance.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this festive scene the skipper approached. He walked\r\nwith rapid steps, and, without hesitating an instant, seized a partner\r\nand flung himself, with all the energy of his race, into the mazy dance.\r\n\r\n“I don’t often dance, boys,” he remarked, afterwards, “but when I do, I\r\nmean business.”\r\n\r\nIt was evident that on this occasion the skipper did mean business.\r\nHe danced more vigorously than any. He jumped higher; he whirled his\r\npartner round faster; he danced with more partners than any other, for\r\nhe went through the whole assemblage, and led out every female there,\r\nfrom the oldest woman down to the smallest girl.\r\n\r\nMost of the time he chatted volubly, and flung out remarks which excited\r\nroars of laughter. He won all hearts. He was, in fact, an immense\r\nsuccess. The boys wondered, for they had not imagined that he could\r\nspeak French.\r\n\r\nHe alluded to this afterwards.\r\n\r\n“We have a natral affinity with the French down in New England,” said\r\nhe. “When America was first colonized, our forefathers had to fight the\r\nFrench all the time. The two races were thus brought into connection.\r\nOur forefathers thus caught from the French that nasal twang with\r\nwhich the uneducated still speak English. You find that twang among the\r\nuneducated classes all over the British provinces and New England. It’s\r\nFrench--that’s what it is. Corbet and I are both uneducated men, and we\r\nboth speak English with the French twang. I speak French first rate;\r\nand Corbet there could speak it first rate also, if he only knew the\r\nlanguage perfectly.”\r\n\r\nThese remarks the boys did not quite know how to take. The skipper\r\nseemed to have a bantering way with him, and spoke so oddly that it\r\nwas impossible for them to make out half of the time whether he was in\r\nearnest or only in jest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n_Friendly Advice and dismal Forebodings.--Once more upon the Waters,\r\nyet once more.--Due North.--A Calm.--The Calm continues.--A terrible\r\nDisclosure.--Despair of Corbet.--Solomon finds his Occupation\r\ngone.--Taking Stock.--Short Allowance._\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER day was passed very pleasantly at the Magdalen Islands, and\r\nthen the boys concluded that they had seen about all that there was\r\nto be seen in this place. As the question where next to go arose, they\r\nConcluded to ask the skipper.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said he, “in the first place, let me ask you if you’ve ever\r\nheard of Anticosti?”\r\n\r\n“Of course we have,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Well, don’t go there; don’t go near it; don’t go within fifty mile of\r\nit; don’t speak of it; don’t think of it; and don’t dream of it. It’s a\r\nplace of horror, a howling wilderness, the abomination of desolation, a\r\nhaunted island, a graveyard of unfortunate sailors. Its shores are lined\r\nwith their bones. Don’t you go and add your young bones to the lot. You\r\ncan do far better with them.”\r\n\r\n“Well, where do you advise us to go?” asked Arthur.\r\n\r\nThe skipper thought for a few moments without answering.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, “you know Sable Island.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bart, in some surprise.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the skipper, impressively, “don’t go there; don’t go within\r\na hundred miles of it; don’t speak of it; don’t think of it; don’t dream\r\nof it.”\r\n\r\n“But you’ve said all that to us before,” said Bruce. “We want to know\r\nwhere we _are_ to go, not where we are _not_ to go.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the skipper, “I am aware that I’ve said all this before,\r\nand I say it a second time, deliberately, for the simple purpose of\r\nimpressing it upon your minds. There’s nothin like repetition to impress\r\na thing on the memory; and so, if you ever come to grief on Anticosti,\r\nor on Sable Island, you’ll remember my warnin, and you’ll never feel\r\nlike blamin me.”\r\n\r\n“But where ought we to go?” asked Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s the next point. Now, I’ve been thinkin’ all about it, and\r\nto my mind there ain’t any place in all this here region that comes up\r\nto the Bay of Islands, Newfoundland.”\r\n\r\n“The Bay of Islands?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the Bay of Islands, on the west coast of Newfoundland. It’s a\r\ngreat place. I’ve been there over and over, and I know it like a book.\r\nThousands of vessels go there every season. It’s one of the best harbors\r\nin the gulf. It’s one of the most beautiful places in the world. The air\r\nis bracing, the climate salubrious, the scenery inviting; and it only\r\nneeds a first-class hotel with all the modern improvements in order to\r\nbecome a number one waterin-place. Yes, by ginger!” he continued, “you\r\nplant a first-class hotel there, and let that there place become known,\r\nand there’s nothin to prevent it from goin ahead of Long Branch or\r\nNewport, or any other place you can mention.\r\n\r\n“Then,” continued the skipper, “if you wanted to go any further, you\r\nmight go up the Straits of Belle Isle, and round Newfoundland. If you\r\nhad time, you might take a run over to Greenland; it’s gettin to be\r\nquite a place, a fashionable resort in the hot summer; but perhaps\r\nyou won’t have time, and won’t care about doin more than cruisin round\r\nNewfoundland, and then home.”\r\n\r\nOnce more the skipper’s tone seemed somewhat extravagant to the boys,\r\nand they did not know how to take it.\r\n\r\n“O, well,” said Bart, “we don’t want to go to Greenland this season.\r\nWhen we do go there, we shall probably go for good; but just now, we\r\nwant to confine ourselves to the gulf. If you can really recommend the\r\nBay of Islands, perhaps we had better go there; that is,” added Bart,\r\n“unless you think we had better go to Iceland.”\r\n\r\nThe skipper looked at Bart for a few moments in silence, and a smile\r\ngradually passed over his face.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, after a pause, “that’s the identical place that I was\r\njust going to recommend, when you took the words out of my mouth.\r\nThe fact is, boys, with that old tub of yours you might as well go to\r\nIceland as anywhere else. Every time I look at it I am thunderstruck.\r\nWhat were your fathers and mothers thinkin of when they let you come\r\naway up here in such an old rattle-trap?--an old tub that isn’t worth\r\nbeing condemned! Do you think you’ll ever get home again in her? Not\r\nyou. Do you know where that old tub’s bound to go before the end of this\r\nseason? Down to the bottom of the sea; and if you don’t go in her, you\r\nmay bless your lucky stars. I only wish I wasn’t otherwise engaged. I’d\r\nmake you all clear out at once, and come aboard the Fawn.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet was not present, and did not hear these insulting\r\nreflections upon his beloved Antelope, and therefore was spared the pain\r\nwhich they would have caused to his aged bosom; but the boys were not\r\nthe ones to listen to such insinuations in silence. The Antelope was\r\ndear to them from past associations, and they all began at once to\r\nvindicate her character. They talked long and eloquently about her. They\r\nspoke of her speed, soundness, and beauty. They told of her performances\r\nthus far.\r\n\r\nAt all of which the skipper only grinned.\r\n\r\n“Mark my words, boys,” said he; “that there tub is goin to the bottom.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if she does, she’ll get up again,” said Bart.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of the two parties were so different that any\r\nfurther debate was useless. The skipper believed that they were bound\r\nfor the bottom of the sea; the boys on the contrary had faith in\r\nthe Antelope. The end of it all was, that they concluded to take the\r\nskipper’s advice in part, and sail for the Bay of Islands. This place\r\nwas one which they all were desirous of visiting, and they thought that\r\nwhen they had gone that far, they could then decide best where next to\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nThey were to leave the next morning. That evening they took leave of the\r\nfriendly skipper.\r\n\r\n“Boys,” said he, “I’m afraid we’ll never meet again; but if you do get\r\nback safe from this perilous adventure of yours, and if any of you ever\r\nhappen to be at Gloucester, Massachusetts, I do wish you’d look me up,\r\nand let me know. I’d give anything to see any one of you again.”\r\n\r\nWith these words the skipper shook hands with each one of them heartily,\r\nand so took his leave.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning the Antelope spread her sails and began\r\nonce more to traverse the seas, heading towards the north. The wind\r\nwas fair, and all that day they moved farther and farther away from the\r\nMagdalen Islands, until at length towards evening they were lost to view\r\nin distance and darkness.\r\n\r\nOn the next day they were all up early. They saw all around a boundless\r\nexpanse of water. No land was anywhere visible, and not a sail was in\r\nsight. This was a novelty to the boys, for never yet had any of them had\r\nthis experience in the Antelope. Some of them had been out of sight of\r\nland, it is true; but then they were in large ships, or ocean steamers.\r\nBeing in such a situation in a craft like the Antelope, was a far\r\ndifferent thing. Yet none of them felt anything like anxiety, nor had\r\nthe slurs of the skipper produced any effect upon their affectionate\r\ntrust in their gallant bark, and in their beloved Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\nCertainly on the present occasion there was little enough cause for\r\nanxiety about the sea-worthiness of the Antelope. The sea was as smooth\r\nas a mirror, and its glassy surface extended far and wide around them.\r\nThere was not a breath of air stirring. They learned from Wade that the\r\nwind had gradually died away between sundown and midnight, until it had\r\nceased altogether. They were now in a dead calm.\r\n\r\nNone of the party was very well pleased at this. They all wished to be\r\nmoving. They disliked calms, and would have much preferred a moderate\r\ngale of wind. The Antelope, however, was here, and there was no help for\r\nit. She was far away from land. She lay gently rising and falling, as\r\nthe long ocean rollers raised her up and let her down; and her sails\r\nflapped idly in the still air, at the motion of the vessel. The boys did\r\nthe best they could under the circumstances, and tried to pass away the\r\ntime in various ways. Some of them tried to sleep; others extemporized\r\na checker-board, and played till they were tired; others walked up\r\nand down, or lounged about. All of them, however, found their chief\r\nemployment in one occupation, and that was eating. Ever since they had\r\nbeen on the water their appetites had been sharpened; and now that they\r\nhad nothing else to do, the occupation of eating became more important\r\nand engrossing. To prolong the repast while it was before them as far as\r\npossible, and then to anticipate the next, were important aids towards\r\nkilling the time.\r\n\r\nAll that day the calm continued: on going to bed that night, the boys\r\nconfidently looked forward to a change of weather on the following day.\r\nThe night was calm. The following day came. They were all up betimes. To\r\ntheir deep disappointment they found no change whatever. There was the\r\nsame calm, the same unruffled sea, the same cloudless sky. Not a sail\r\nwas visible anywhere, and of course there was no sign of land on any\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nThe second day the time hung more heavily on their hands. Some of them\r\nproposed fishing; but they had no hooks, and moreover no bait. Pat\r\nproposed fashioning a spike into a hook; fastening it on a line,\r\nand fishing for sharks, and worked all day at a rusty spike for this\r\npurpose. Unfortunately, he could not get it sharp enough, and so he had\r\nat length to give it up.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet was perhaps the most impatient of all; and this seemed\r\nsingular to the boys, who thus far had known him only as the most\r\npatient and the most enduring of men.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, however, his patience seemed to have departed. He\r\nfidgeted about incessantly. He kept watching the sea, the sky, and the\r\nhorizon, and occupied himself for hours in all the various ways common\r\namong seamen, who indulge in the superstitious practice of trying\r\nto “raise the wind.” One mode consisted in standing in one position\r\nmotionless for half an hour or more, watching the horizon, and\r\nwhistling: another was a peculiar snapping of the fingers; another was\r\nthe  burning of some hairs pulled from his own venerable head. These\r\nand other similar acts excited intense interest among the boys, and\r\nhelped to make the time pass less slowly. Unfortunately, not one of\r\nthese laudable efforts was successful, and the obstinate wind refused to\r\nbe “raised.”\r\n\r\nThat day the boys detected something in their meals which seemed like a\r\ndecline of skill on the part of Solomon. There was a falling off both\r\nin the quantity and in the quality of the eatables. Only four potatoes\r\ngraced the festive board, and a piece of corned beef that was quite\r\ninadequate to their wants. The tea was weak, and there was very little\r\nsugar. There was only a small supply of butter, and this butter seemed\r\nrather unpleasantly dirty.\r\n\r\nOn the following day all this was explained. Hurrying up on deck at\r\nearly dawn, they saw the scene unchanged. Above was the cloudless sky,\r\nall around the glassy sea, and before them stood Captain Corbet, the\r\npicture of despair. By his side stood Solomon, with his hands clasped\r\ntogether, and his head hanging down.\r\n\r\n“It’s all my fault, boys,” said Captain Corbet, with something like\r\na groan. “I was to blame: But I declare, I clean forgot. And yet what\r\nbusiness had I to forget? my fustest and highest duty bein to remember.\r\nAnd here we air!”\r\n\r\n“Why, what’s the matter?” asked Tom, who, like all the rest was struck\r\nby Captain Corbet’s despairing attitude and words.\r\n\r\n“I won’t hide it any longer, boys,” said he; “it’s this calm. I didn’t\r\ncalculate on bein becalmed. I thought only of head winds, and then we\r\ncould hev put back easy; but a calm! Why, what can you do?”\r\n\r\n“Hide it?” Cried Bruce. “Hide what? What do you mean by this? What would\r\nyou want to put back for?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet groaned.\r\n\r\n“For--for pro--provisions, dear boys,” he said mournfully, and with an\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n“Provisions!” repeated Bruce, and looked very blank indeed. All the\r\nboys exchanged glanced, which were full of unutterable things. There was\r\nsilence for some time.\r\n\r\nTom was the first to break it.\r\n\r\n“Well, what have we?” he, asked, in his usual cheery voice. “Come\r\ncaptain, tell us what there is in the larder.”\r\n\r\n“Ask Solomon,” said Captain Corbet, mournfully.\r\n\r\n“Well, Solomon, tell us the worst,” said Tom.\r\n\r\nBut Solomon would not or could not speak. He raised his head, looked\r\nwildly around, and then hurried away.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet looked after him, and heaved a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\n“Wal, boys,” said he, “the fact is, Solomon and me, we’ve been talkin it\r\nall over. You see, he considers himself cook, and cook only, and looks\r\nto me for the material. It’s all my fault. I forgot. I thought there was\r\nlots till yesterday mornin. Then Solomon told me how it was. I’d ort to\r\nhave laid in a supply before leavin Bay de Chaleur; but as I said, I\r\nforgot. And as for Solomon, why, he’s been calmly a continooin of his\r\ncookery, same as if he was chief cook of a fust-class hotel, and all the\r\ntime he was in a becalmed schewner. He told me all about it yesterday\r\nmornin; but I says, ‘Don’t tell the boys; mebbe the wind’ll change, and\r\nI’ll sail for the nighest port.’ So he didn’t, except so far as you\r\nmight have guessed, from the meals which he served up; pooty slim they\r\nwere too; but he did his best.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Tom, with unaltered self-possession, “it would have been\r\nbetter for us to have known this yesterday morning; but that can’t be\r\nhelped. So we have no more provisions?”\r\n\r\n“Precious little,” said Captain Corbet, mournfully.\r\n\r\n“Have we any?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said Captain Corbet, “the tea’s all gone; and the coffee, and all\r\nthe potted meats, and the apples, and the taters, and the turnips and\r\ncarrots, and all the vegetables, and the smoked provisions, and you had\r\nthe last mite of corned beef yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“But what is there left?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“Only two or three papers of corn starch,” said Captain Corbet, with an\r\neffort, “and, I believe, a half box of raisins, and a little rice.”\r\n\r\n“And nothing else?”\r\n\r\n“Not a hooter,” said Captain Corbet, despairingly.\r\n\r\nTom was silent. The boys all looked at one another with anxious faces,\r\nand then began to talk over the situation.\r\n\r\nThe result was, that first of all they made Solomon produce everything\r\nin the shape of eatables that remained on board. Solomon ransacked the\r\nvessel, and laid everything out on the cabin table.\r\n\r\nIt was not a very large supply, and the display created additional\r\nuneasiness in the minds of the boys.\r\n\r\nThere were,--\r\n\r\n3 papers of corn starch, 1 lb. each.\r\n\r\n1 ham bone.\r\n\r\nl box raisins.\r\n\r\n1 lb. rice.\r\n\r\n6 biscuits.\r\n\r\n1 bowl soup.\r\n\r\n4 carrots.\r\n\r\n1 potato, turnip.\r\n\r\n2 apples.\r\n\r\n1 oz. tea.\r\n\r\nThis was all--absolutely all on board the Antelope for the sustenance of\r\nno less than nine human beings, all of whom were blessed with excellent\r\nappetites. Fortunately, there was a sufficient supply of fresh water, so\r\nthat there was no trouble on that score.\r\n\r\nBut this supply of food, even when husbanded with the greatest care,\r\ncould scarcely last more than one day,--and here they were in the middle\r\nof the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and becalmed!\r\n\r\nThe circumstances in which they were, excited the deepest anxiety in\r\nthe minds of all. A grave and earnest discussion followed as to the best\r\ncourse to be pursued. First of all, they all resolved to deny themselves\r\nas far as possible, and make their supply of provisions last three days.\r\nThis could be done by making a very thin soup out of the ham bone with\r\nthe potato and turnip. The raisins were to be cooked with the corn\r\nstarch and rice, in one general mess, which was to be carefully divided\r\nday by day. The biscuits, carrots, and apples were to be reserved.\r\n\r\nAfter this they decided to try and construct something like oars, and\r\npropel the Antelope in that manner.\r\n\r\nThe provisions were divided and cooked in accordance with this decision.\r\nThey all went without breakfast, for they had decided to eat but one\r\nmeal per day. At midday they partook of this important meal, which\r\nconsumed one third of their whole stock. But little was afforded out of\r\nthat one meal for each individual, and each one felt able to consume the\r\nwhole repast, instead of the beggarly ninth part which fell to him. Poor\r\nCaptain Corbet refused at first to eat, and so did Solomon, for each\r\nreproached himself as the cause of the present famine; but the boys put\r\na stop to this by refusing also to eat, and thus compelled Solomon and\r\nthe captain to take the allotted nourishment.\r\n\r\nAs to the oars or sweeps, the plan proved a total failure. There was\r\nnothing on board which could be used for that purpose. There was but\r\none small oar for the boat, and they could find nothing else that could\r\nserve for an oar except the spars of the schooner, and they were not\r\nquite prepared to resort to these. Even if they had done so, there was\r\nnot an axe or a hatchet on board with which to fashion them into the\r\nrequisite shape. There was, in fact, no tool larger than a pocket knife,\r\nexcept perhaps the table knives, and they were too dull.\r\n\r\nThe calm continued.\r\n\r\nThus the first day of their famine passed.\r\n\r\nThey went to bed hungry.\r\n\r\nThey awaked famished, and found the calm still continuing. There was no\r\nbreakfast for them. The long hours passed slowly. In vain Captain Corbet\r\nwhistled for a wind. The wind came not.\r\n\r\nDinner was served at midday. Each one ate his meagre share. Each\r\none felt that this repast only tantalized his appetite, rather than\r\nsatisfied it. Solomon was in despair. Captain Corbet heaped upon himself\r\nnever-ending reproaches. Wade sat stolid and starving on the deck. The\r\nboys stared, with hungry eyes, around the horizon.\r\n\r\nThere was not a sign of land; there was not a sail to be seen.\r\n\r\nSo the second day passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n_The third Day.--A strange Sail.--Below the Horizon.--Making\r\nSignals.--No Answer.--Weary Waiting.--Starvation stares them in\r\nthe Face.--A long Day.--Hope dying out.--A long Discussion upon\r\nthe Situation.--The last Meal.--Bruce and Bart come to a desperate\r\nDetermination.--The secret Resolve._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE third day came.\r\n\r\nThe boys slept soundly during the night, and were up early. As they\r\ntook their first look all around, their feelings were those of deep\r\ndespondency; for far and wide, as before, there was nothing visible but\r\nthe smooth sea and the cloudless sky. The calm continued, and all the\r\neast was glowing with the fiery rays of the rising sun.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a cry from Phil.\r\n\r\n“A ship! A ship!”\r\n\r\n“Where? Where?” asked all the others.\r\n\r\n“There! There!” cried Phil, in intense excitement, pointing towards the\r\neast, where the fiery sky rose over the glowing water. Looking in the\r\ndirection where he pointed, they all saw it plainly. It was indeed as he\r\nsaid. It was a ship, and it was now plainly visible, though at first,\r\non account of the glare, none of them had noticed it but Phil. As they\r\nstood and looked at it, every one of them was filled with such deep\r\nemotions of joy and gratitude that not a word was said. Captain Corbet\r\nwas the first to break the solemn silence.\r\n\r\n“Wal, I declar,” said he, “it’s ben so dim all along that I didn’t\r\nnotice her; and then it kine o’ got so bright that the glare dazzled my\r\neyes; but there she is, sure enough; and now all we’ve got to do is to\r\nmanage to get into communication with her.”\r\n\r\nThe boys made no answer, but stood looking in silence. Every minute the\r\nglare lessened; then the sun rose, and as it ascended above the horizon,\r\nthe form of the strange ship became fully revealed.\r\n\r\nIt was a ship apparently of considerable size; but her hull was low down\r\nin the water, and only her masts were visible. She seemed to lie below\r\nthe horizon, yet was as plain to the eye as though she had been only\r\nfive miles away.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said Bruce, at length, “I don’t know how you feel, but for\r\nmy part I feel like taking the boat and going off to her at once. I’m\r\nsick of this fare, and should like to get a good breakfast. What do you\r\nthink, captain?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said he, “I don’t exactly seem to see my way clear to approvin of\r\nyou takin a row for such a matter as twenty mile or so. We’d never see\r\nyou again.”\r\n\r\n“Twenty miles!” exclaimed Bruce. “Why, it doesn’t look like more than\r\ntwo.”\r\n\r\nThe captain smiled.\r\n\r\n“Why, you can’t see more of her than her masts,” replied Captain Corbet;\r\n“and a ship that’s down below the horizon far enough to hide her hull is\r\na pooty good distance off--twenty mile, at least.”\r\n\r\nAt this Bruce was silent. Captain Corbet’s remarks were unanswerable,\r\nand he did not yet feel prepared to row so great a distance as twenty\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nAt length Bart went to the cabin, and returned with a spy-glass. This\r\ninstrument did not belong to Captain Corbet, for the venerable navigator\r\nwas strongly prejudiced against any such instruments, and the dimmer his\r\neyes grew, the stronger grew those prejudices. It belonged, in fact, to\r\nBruce, who had provided himself with it before leaving home. Armed with\r\nthis, Bart took a long look at the stranger. Then he passed the glass to\r\nBruce, and then all the boys, in turn, took a look.\r\n\r\nThe strange ship already appeared surprisingly distinct for a vessel\r\nthat lay below the horizon; and on looking at her through the glass,\r\nthis distinctness became more startling. Most of her sails were furled,\r\nor rather, there appeared to be no sails at all, except the jib. The\r\nfore and main-top gallant masts were gone. She appeared, indeed, to have\r\nencountered a storm, in which she had lost her spars, and the present\r\ncalm seemed very little in accordance with her appearance.\r\n\r\nThe comments which the boys made upon the appearance of the stranger\r\nexcited Captain Corbet’s curiosity to such a degree that he surmounted\r\nhis prejudices, and condescended to look through the glass. His\r\nastonishment at the result was due rather to his own ignorance of\r\nglasses than to anything in the strange ship; but after he had become\r\nsomewhat more familiar with the instrument, he began to pay attention to\r\nthe object of his scrutiny.\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” said he, after a long and careful search, “it doos railly\r\nlook jest for all the world as if that thar craft has been in a storm,\r\nand lost her spars and sails. Perhaps he’s in distress. Perhaps they’re\r\nwatching us more anxiously than we’re watching them.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if they can see us?” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid not,” said Bart, “we’re so small.”\r\n\r\n“But they’ve got a glass.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and they’d be sweeping the horizon for help.”\r\n\r\n“I wish we could get nearer.”\r\n\r\n“If they’re hard up, they might row to us.”\r\n\r\n“Is it any use to signalize, captain?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“Not a mite,” said Captain Corbet. “You can’t signalize to a vessel so\r\nfar away; at least I never heard of such a thing.”\r\n\r\n“O, well, captain,” objected Bruce, “you see they have glasses. We could\r\nsee any signals if they were to hoist them, and they can see us as well\r\nas we can see them, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said Captain Corbet, thoughtfully, “perhaps they can; and if so,\r\nI’m sure I don’t see why we mayn’t try. So you may as well hist that\r\nthar flag o’ yourn, boys. It can’t do any harm, at any rate.”\r\n\r\nThis proposal was at once acted upon. Several of the boys sprang aft,\r\nand seizing the lines, began to lower and elevate, incessantly, the\r\nproud, yet somewhat battered banner of the B. O. W. C.--the banner whose\r\npictured face had so often grinned at them through many an adventure, in\r\nstorm and in calm. It gave them an occupation; it also served to excite\r\nhope; and so, for several hours, the flag never ceased to rise and\r\nfall,--the boys taking turns at it, and one relieving the other, so as\r\nto keep a fresh hand always at the work. This continued till midday; but\r\nat length they gave it up in disgust.\r\n\r\nThey gave it up because it had not produced the slightest result, nor\r\nexcited the smallest attention; nor had the circumstances of their\r\nsituation changed in any respect whatever. Far away lay the ship, and no\r\nmore of her was visible. Nothing but her masts appeared to their eyes;\r\nnot a particle of her hull could be seen. She seemed somewhat longer\r\nnow, and some of them accounted for this on the ground that she had\r\nchanged her position somewhat, and presented her broadside more than she\r\nhad done in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe weather had not changed, nor were there any signs whatever of a\r\nchange. The sky was still as cloudless as ever, and not the faintest\r\nfleck disturbed the expanse of blue that hung above them. The sea was\r\nunruffled, nor was there any puff of wind to agitate its surface.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, when that strange ship first appeared, they had\r\nhoped that a wind might arise before long to bring them together; or, if\r\na wind did not come, that at least the currents of the sea might drift\r\nthem into closer proximity; but now there began to arise a dark fear\r\nthat, instead of drifting nearer together, they might be carried farther\r\nasunder, and that this strange ship, which had thus been borne so\r\nmysteriously to their sight during the darkness, might, on the advent of\r\nanother day, be borne as mysteriously out of their sight. With anxious\r\neyes they watched her form, testing it in every possible way, to\r\ndiscover whether the intervening space had increased or lessened. Some\r\nof the more desponding ones were convinced that they were drifting\r\nasunder; others, more hopeful, maintained that they were nearer; while\r\nothers, again, asserted that their respective positions had not changed.\r\nAnd, in fact, it was evident from the very dispute itself, that the\r\nposition of the two vessels had not very greatly altered.\r\n\r\nHalf of the day had passed. Another half remained; and after that, what?\r\nNight and darkness, and then how easily could they drift away from this\r\nstranger, on which they had been placing such hopes! How could they\r\nexpect that the rest of the day would be any different from the\r\nbeginning?\r\n\r\nMidday had come, and this was the time for their single daily meal.\r\nMoreover, this meal was the last,--the last of the three portions which\r\nthey had set aside for the consumption of three days.\r\n\r\nHere arose a solemn question.\r\n\r\nShould they eat up all of this last portion? or should they divide it\r\ninto two parts, reserving something for the possible emergency of the\r\nnext day? The moment that this was proposed, they all decided at once\r\nto reserve something, and not to devour at once all that was left.\r\nThey determined to deny themselves for this day for the security of the\r\nmorrow; and, hungry though they were, they preferred to have a meagre\r\nrepast with hope, rather than a fuller repast with despair. And so their\r\ndinner was divided, and one portion set aside for the next day. Meagre\r\nindeed and inadequate was this repast for these long-fasting and\r\nravenous boys; but there was no help for it; and as yet they had not\r\nquite reached the worst. They, therefore, all tried most strenuously to\r\nlook on the bright side, make the best of their situation, and cheer one\r\nanother with remarks of a hopeful and encouraging character.\r\n\r\nDinner was prolonged as far as possible. Then came the long hours of\r\nthe afternoon. Gradually the efforts of the boys to keep up their own\r\nspirits and encourage one another grew feebler and feebler. From time\r\nto time they made faint efforts to find occupation for themselves, by\r\nresorting to the flag, and actively lowering and hoisting it. But the\r\ngreater part of the time was spent in silently and sadly staring at the\r\nstrange ship, sometimes through the glass, whenever they could get\r\nthe chance, but generally without it. The remarks grew more and more\r\ninfrequent. The hoplessness of their situation began to weigh down more\r\nand more the spirits of each, and at length they, one and all, relapsed\r\ninto silence. Solomon kept out of sight. Wade sat, as usual, stolid and\r\npassive. Captain Corbet stood at the helm, looking in all directions, at\r\nsea and sky, with an unchanged expression of heart-broken melancholy. So\r\nthe time passed.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was far worse than the morning: in every respect. The\r\nmoral tone of the whole party had declined, and the whole scene around\r\npresented no encouraging feature. In the morning they had been inspired\r\nby the hope of making communications with the ship, but now this hope\r\ndied out more and more with every passing moment.\r\n\r\nAt length the sun went down, and then the shadows of the gloomy night\r\nfollowed slowly and steadily. One by one the shades passed over the\r\ndistant ship, until at last they stood staring at the place where they\r\nhad seen her, but where now they could see nothing but darkness. This\r\ncompleted their despondency, and the gloom around was commensurate with\r\nthat which now fell darkly and desparingly over the soul of each.\r\n\r\nFor a long time they wandered up and down the deck. No one spoke. Each\r\none was involved in his own gloomy thoughts. At length, one by one, they\r\nretired to their beds, with the hope of forgetting their cares in sleep.\r\n\r\nBruce and Bart were left on the deck alone. All the rest had gone below.\r\nAround all was dark. Both the boys were pacing up and down restlessly on\r\nopposite sides of the deck.\r\n\r\nAt length Bruce stopped. “Bart,” said he, in a low voice, “is that you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bart. “Look here. I’ve got something I want to tell you.”\r\n\r\nAt this Bart came up to him in silence.\r\n\r\n“I don’t like this style of thing,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Why, what can we do?”\r\n\r\n“O, never mind. I’ve got a plan. Do you think we couldn’t have been\r\ndoing better all this day than staying here, moping our lives out?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I mean the very thing that I proposed this morning.”\r\n\r\n“What, to row to the ship?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Why not?”\r\n\r\n“How can you row twenty miles?”\r\n\r\n“Stuff and nonsense. She can’t be so far. Captain Corbet’s utterly\r\nmistaken.”\r\n\r\n“Why, she’s below the horizon.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care. I judge from the looks of her. Do you believe you can see\r\nso plainly a ship that’s twenty miles away? Why, man alive, if she had a\r\nflag up you could almost make it out. For my part, I feel sure that she\r\nisn’t over five miles away at the very farthest. I haven’t the slightest\r\ndoubt about it. Why, Bart, you and I are both accustomed enough to look\r\nat ships out on the water, and you can see for yourself that it’s simply\r\nimpossible that this one can be so far away as twenty miles, or farther\r\naway than I say. All the morning I couldn’t help feeling puzzled, and\r\nconcluded that it might be something in the atmosphere that magnified\r\nthe ship, and made her seem so near,--like the mirage, you know; but,\r\nafterwards, I gave that up.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bart, after some thought, “I don’t know but what you’re\r\nabout right, Bruce; but what are you going to do?”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ve got this night before us, and if the wind comes, why, of\r\ncourse we are all right. But suppose that the wind doesn’t come, and we\r\nfind ourselves to-morrow morning as we did this morning, with that ship\r\nso near. Do you feel able to stand here all day, and watch, and wait,\r\nand then sit down to our last dinner? I don’t. Or suppose that we find\r\nourselves gradually drifting away from her. No--I can’t stand it. I’ve\r\nmade up my mind to row out to her. What do you say? Will you come with\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“I will,” said Bart, firmly. “I’ll go, even if it is twenty miles. I’d\r\ngo forty, rather than live this day over again. But when do you propose\r\nto start?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been thinking it all over,” said Bruce. “My plan is this: We’ll\r\nget all ready to-night; that is, have the oars in the boat, and put in a\r\ncouple of bottles of fresh water; besides, we can take with us about\r\nour share of the food that remains. Well, to-morrow morning, if the calm\r\ncontinues, the moment that we see the ship, we’ll start, and row for\r\nher. Why, if we had only done that this morning, by this time we’d\r\nhave been on board of her, with a boat from the ship back here with\r\nprovisions. Mind you, don’t think of twenty miles; it isn’t more than\r\nfive at the very furthest--perhaps not over three or four.”\r\n\r\n“All right. I’ll go. Do you intend to tell anybody?”\r\n\r\n“No; not a soul. The rest of the fellows would insist on going; and it\r\nwill be better for us two only to go; it will prevent confusion, and be\r\nthe best for all concerned.”\r\n\r\n“But how can we get away without their knowing it?”\r\n\r\n“O, my idea is to push off from the schooner before any one is up, and\r\nthen watch for the appearance of the ship by daylight. The moment we see\r\nher we can pull for her.”\r\n\r\n“That seems pretty good,” said Bart, thoughtfully; “but it is a puzzle\r\nto me how that ship can be below the horizon, and yet not be farther off\r\nthan five miles. She certainly did not look farther away than that. For\r\nmy part, I don’t see how she could be less than ten miles at the\r\nleast, so as to be so completely hidden. I forget the rule for the\r\ndisappearance of a ship below the horizon; but there is something\r\nin this one that I can’t understand. Yet, as you say, judging by the\r\nappearance of her masts, one might imagine her to be not more than three\r\nor four miles off. After all, it must be mirage.”\r\n\r\n“O, no; mirage doesn’t last all day long, without the slightest change.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t know. It may in this case.”\r\n\r\n“Well, of course I don’t pretend to understand all the freaks of the\r\natmosphere; but all that I’ve ever read about the mirage shows that it\r\nis incessantly shifting and changing, and never lasts over an hour\r\nor so, at the furthest. Besides, in our latitudes, these peculiar\r\nappearances only take place in the morning.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t know,” said Bart. “At any rate, I shall be prepared for a\r\nrow of at least ten miles.”\r\n\r\n“All right. Make up your mind to that, and then you won’t be\r\ndisappointed.”\r\n\r\n“Shall you go to bed to-night, Bruce?”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“But how can you wake?”\r\n\r\n“O, I can wake whenever I like. I’ll wake you.”\r\n\r\n“All right. About what time?”\r\n\r\n“O, about an hour before daybreak; but come, let’s get things ready\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\nThe boys then went about completing their preparations for their\r\nadventurous journey. These were but slight. They consisted in simply\r\nputting on board the boat, which was floating astern, two bottles of\r\nfresh water and a little of the provision which had been put aside for\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\nAfter this they both retired.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, at about three o’clock? Bruce laid his hand\r\non Bart’s forehead. Bart awoke instantly. The two then went as softly as\r\npossible on deck. No one was there. All were below, sound asleep.\r\n\r\nSilently, yet quickly, the two boys got into the boat, and then pushed\r\noff. There were two oars in the boat. Each took one, and then began to\r\nrow. But, after a few strokes, Bruce took the oar from Bart, for the\r\nboat was too small for two oarsmen. So Bruce pulled very silently out\r\ninto the darkness over the water, in the direction which they supposed\r\nwould lead towards the strange ship. After rowing about a hundred yards\r\nBruce stopped. Both boys now waited patiently till it should become\r\nlight enough for them to see the ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n_Daybreak.--Startling Discovery.--The Boat gone.--Where are Bruce\r\nand Bart?--Dismay.--The long Row.--The distant Ship.--Below\r\nthe Horizon.--Deep in the Water.--The shattered\r\nSails.--Waterlogged!--Boarding the Stranger.--Discoveries of a Kind\r\nwhich are at once exciting and pleasing._\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH the break of day the boys were all on deck. Their first impulse\r\nwas to take a look around. They saw the reddening eastern sky and the\r\nsmooth water all around them, and their hearts sank within them as\r\nthey perceived that the wearisome calm still continued. They noticed,\r\nhowever, that the ship was still visible, and this was some consolation.\r\nIt seemed now a little nearer than the day before.\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said Tom, “we’ve got nearer to her: don’t you think so?”\r\n\r\nThe captain made no reply. Tom looked up, and repeated his remark. As\r\nhe looked up, he saw Captain Corbet standing astern with a puzzled\r\nexpression, and looking down into the water and all around.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“The boat,” said Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n“What of her?”\r\n\r\n“Some one’s been and stole her, or else she’s gone to the bottom, only\r\nthe rope’s gone, too.”\r\n\r\n“What! the boat!” cried Tom. “You don’t mean to say the boat’s gone!”\r\n\r\nThe other boys were startled at this, and hurried aft to look for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad I wasn’t in her this time, at any rate,” said Tom, and then\r\nadded in a melancholy voice, “but I suppose it wouldn’t make much\r\ndifference now.”\r\n\r\nThe boys stood in silence for some time, not quite knowing how to take\r\nthis new incident. At length Phil looked all around.\r\n\r\n“Where’s Bart?” he asked, “and Bruce?”\r\n\r\n“They’re not up,” said Tom. “Don’t wake them. Let them sleep as long as\r\nthey can.”\r\n\r\n“Up? They’re not down, either,” said Phil. “Their berths are empty.”\r\n\r\nThe boys all stared at each other. A suspicion flashed across their\r\nminds.\r\n\r\n“Sure and if they’re not up nor down, they must be in the boat, and\r\nthere you have it,” said Pat, dryly. “And it’s meself,” he added, “that\r\n’ud be proud to be with thim this day.”\r\n\r\n“The boat? But what for?” asked Phil.\r\n\r\n“They must have started off for the ship,” said Tom, who-now understood\r\nall.\r\n\r\nAt this they all looked with eager eyes over the water in the direction\r\nof the ship. All thought that they could see a shadowy spot, but it was\r\ntoo indistinct as yet to be resolved into anything. After a few minutes\r\nPhil went below, and returned with the glass, through which he looked\r\nlong and attentively.\r\n\r\n“It’s them,” said he at last, passing the glass to Arthur.\r\n\r\nArthur looked, and then Tom, and then Pat, and then Captain Corbet.\r\nIt grew brighter and brighter every moment, and at length, as Corbet\r\nlooked, he saw the boat plainly for an instant; but the next moment the\r\nglare of the rising sun drove his eyes away. The sun rose and ascended\r\nhigher, and still they could see the boys rowing with quick strokes very\r\nfar away, while beyond lay the strange ship.\r\n\r\nIt was still as low down as ever, “below the horizon,” as Captain Corbet\r\nsaid, but was very much larger and plainer. Every one of them wondered\r\nhow she could be in reality so far away as twenty miles. None of them\r\nspoke, however, but stood with varying feelings, staring in silence\r\nafter their companions.\r\n\r\nOf them all the most affected was Captain Corbet. At the first mention\r\nof the fact he had started, and after having assured himself of\r\nits truth with his own eyes, he exhibited every mark of the deepest\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said he, as he stood with his head bowed upon his breast. “I\r\nnever! Who’d a thought it! Why, its ravin madness. And them, too,\r\nthinkin of rowin to a ship that’s below the horizon. Twenty mile in that\r\nthar boat, if it’s an inch, and two mile an hour’s the most they can\r\ndo. Why, it’s temptin fate. It’s flyin in the face of Providence. That’s\r\nwhat it is. That thar ship’s twenty mile away. The wind’ll come up\r\nbefore they get half way. They’ll never get there--never. And stealin\r\noff in this way, too! Why didn’t they get me to go with them? Why didn’t\r\nthey ask my advice? And them, too, a trustin of their two perecious\r\nlives in that thar ferrail bark, that hadn’t ought ever to go more’n\r\na mile at the furthest. And here am I, chained to this post, and can’t\r\nmove, and them a rushin on to utter ruination. O, boys, dear boys,” he\r\nconcluded, in a kind of wail, “for your sakes I want the wind to rise,\r\nbut for their sakes I want it to contennew a calm.”\r\n\r\n“O, captain, never fear,” said Arthur, cheerfully. “They’ll take care of\r\nthemselves easy enough; and, in fact, the more I think of it, the better\r\nit seems.”\r\n\r\n“I only wish I was in the boat,” said Tom, heartily.\r\n\r\n“So do I,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“Sure and that same I said meself at the first,” said Pat.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Solomon had stood a little apart from the rest, looking after\r\nthe boat, but manifesting very different emotions. His occupation being\r\ngone, he had come upon deck to see what the prospects might be, and had\r\nheard everything. Taking advantage of a moment when the glass was not\r\nin requisition, he had given a look towards the receding boat, and\r\nhad assured himself by actual inspection of the facts of the case. The\r\nmoment that he had done this he drew a long breath, laid down the glass,\r\nand then stood looking after the boys with a gentle smile irradiating\r\nhis ebony face. From time to time he would close his eyes, sigh gently,\r\nand his lips would move as though whispering to himself, while once or\r\ntwice a half audible chuckle escaped him.\r\n\r\n“Tell you what it is,” said he at length; “don’t you go on. Dem yer\r\nboys is goin to save der blessed selves and us too. It’s my pinion\r\ndey’ll bring us luck, fust rate, too, fust chop, tip-top, prime. Hooray!\r\nDey’ll quaint dem yar seamen ob our difficulties, an dey’ll come back a\r\nflyin wid a big boat-load of pro-visium. O, you can’t drown dem blessed\r\nchilen. Dey’re boun to tak car ob demselves, and dey’ll work dar way\r\nober de oceum foam, to sabe de libes ob all aboard, and’ll be back\r\nto-night to tea. Hooray! Mind, I tell you!”\r\n\r\nThe gayety and hopefulness of Solomon did not fail to be communicated to\r\nall the rest, until at length even Captain Corbet was willing to admit\r\nthat it was just as well, after all, that they had gone, though he still\r\nprofessed to feel hurt that his advice had not been asked.\r\n\r\nTo the boys their situation seemed now in every way more endurable.\r\nThey had at least something to hope for, and the adventure of their\r\ncompanions formed a perpetual subject for thought or conversation. Even\r\nthe calm was now welcome, for as long as this continued it would be\r\nfavorable to the boat. On the other hand, should the ‘wind arise, they\r\ncould up sail and after them. They all thought that Captain Corbet’s\r\nestimate of a distance of twenty miles was extravagant; and even if the\r\nship was “below the horizon,” they concluded that at the farthest it\r\ncould not be more than eight or ten miles away. Allowing two miles an\r\nhour for the boat, they thought that Bruce and Bart might reach their\r\ndestination by nine or ten o’clock in the morning, and thus have the\r\ngreater part of the day still before them.\r\n\r\nAs the hours passed away, the boys thus beguiled the time by various\r\nspeculations about the progress of their companions. The calm continued;\r\nand they were not sorry, for they saw in this the best chance for a\r\nsuccessful issue to the enterprise. Phil made a sort of chart, with the\r\nschooner and the ship in proper position, and marked off ten intervals\r\nwhich he estimated at a mile each. For hour after hour they watched\r\nthis, and amused themselves by indicating on it the progress of their\r\nfriends. At length it was ten o’clock, and all the boys felt quite sure\r\nthat the boat had reached the ship.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the two adventurous boys had been going on their expedition.\r\nAt a hundred yards from the schooner they had stopped, as we have seen,\r\nand looked anxiously around in the direction where they supposed the\r\nstranger to lie. For some time they could see nothing; but at length,\r\nas it grew lighter, they detected her masts through the gloom, and were\r\noverjoyed at finding that she was nearer than on the previous day. They\r\nhad made a mistake, however, as to the right direction, for the ship lay\r\nvery much more to one side.\r\n\r\n“We’ve drifted nearer together during the night,” said Bruce, “and I\r\ndon’t believe she’s over three miles away.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he changed the boat’s course, and heading for the ship,\r\npulled with all his might.\r\n\r\n“I say, Bruce,” said Bart, “you’d better not pull so hard at first;\r\nyou’ll tire yourself.”\r\n\r\n“O, it’s only till we get further from the schooner. I want to get well\r\nout of the reach of hearing before the fellows see us. I’ll take it easy\r\nafter a time.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he pulled on, watching the schooner, and succeeded in\r\ngetting so far away, that by the time they came on deck he could only\r\ndistinguish the moving figures. Then he slackened his efforts somewhat.\r\n\r\n“There isn’t a bit of prospect of any wind,” said he. “I tell you\r\nwhat it is, my boy: I’d far rather be here this minute than aboard the\r\nAntelope.”\r\n\r\n“So would I,” said Bart; “but can you imagine the state of mind that\r\nthe fellows must be in?”\r\n\r\n“O, they’ll be glad after the first excitement’s over.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if they saw us.”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\n“They didn’t shout, or anything.”\r\n\r\n“We were too far off to hear them.”\r\n\r\n“No, we weren’t; but I suppose we were so far off that they thought it\r\nwould do no good.”\r\n\r\nFor about half an hour Bruce pulled quite leisurely, for he wished to\r\nhusband his strength as much as possible, and then Bart took his turn at\r\nthe oars. Not much was said, partly because the exertion of rowing did\r\nnot allow of any prolonged conversation, and partly because they were\r\ntoo much filled with their own thoughts, arising out of the suspense of\r\nthe occasion.\r\n\r\nAt length, after rowing for another half hour, Bart handed the oars to\r\nBruce, and took his seat in the stern.\r\n\r\nThe moment he did so he uttered a cry of surprise.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” asked Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Why, how near we’re getting!” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Of course we are.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t looked since I took the oars, on purpose to see what our\r\nprogress is. And now--why, really, Bruce, it seems as if we must be half\r\nway already.”\r\n\r\n“Of course we are,” said Bruce, “and more too.”\r\n\r\n“Why, she’s as low in the water as ever.”\r\n\r\n“I know; there’s something queer about her.”\r\n\r\n“She looks as though she’d been in a heavy gale.”\r\n\r\n“She must have been.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see a soul on board.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t seen any one, either.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps no one is up yet. It’s early, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I hope it’s that,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\nBart was silent for a few moments. At length he said,--\r\n\r\n“I should like to see some signs of life there, I must say.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ll know all about her by the time you’re through your next\r\npull.”\r\n\r\nBruce now rowed, and Bart sat with his eyes fixed on the ship. She\r\nstill lay as low in the water as ever, but they could see her bulwarks\r\nplainly, and her cabins. Her rigging seemed as disordered as ever, and\r\nit was a puzzle to Bart, why, in this calm weather, she should be\r\nso neglected. Various unpleasant thoughts arose in his mind, but he\r\nkept-them to himself. Thus the time passed, and Bruce rowed, and the\r\nboat drew steadily nearer. At length he gave the oars over to Bart, and\r\ntook his seat in the stern.\r\n\r\nBy this time they were not more than a mile from the ship. She was\r\ncertainly very low in the water. At a distance they had supposed that\r\nher sails were furled. They could now see that she had no sails at all.\r\nThere was her jib, and that was all. There was no sign of life aboard,\r\nand the disorder in her rigging was more perceptible than ever.\r\n\r\n“Bart,” said Bruce in a solemn tone, after he had gazed silently at the\r\nship for full ten minutes.\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Do you know what I think about her?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“It’s my opinion that there’s not a soul on board of her.”\r\n\r\nBart was silent.\r\n\r\n“She’s evidently been in a storm; her sails are gone; her rigging\r\nis every way. The crew have probably deserted her; and, yes, she\r\nis--there’s no doubt about it. I suspected it--I knew it.”\r\n\r\n“She’s what?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\n“Waterlogged!” said Bruce.\r\n\r\nBart turned his head and looked at her for a long time. He said not a\r\nword. At last he turned to Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, “at any rate, we must board her. After coming so far,\r\nwe can’t go back. Besides, we may find something.”\r\n\r\n“Find something? Of course we shall,” said Bruce, confidently. “We’ll\r\nfind lots of things. We’ll find barrels of pork, and beef, and bread,\r\nand other things besides, no doubt. When they left her, they would only\r\ntake enough to last them till they got ashore. They must have left the\r\ngreater part of their supplies and sea stores behind.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Bart; “so here goes.”\r\n\r\nAnd with these words he pulled as vigorously as though he had not yet\r\nrowed a stroke.\r\n\r\nAnd now every minute they drew nearer and nearer. Bart rowed without\r\nturning his head, but Bruce sat with his eyes fixed upon her,\r\noccasionally telling Bart when he got out of his course.\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer in this way, every doubt was removed, if there had\r\nbeen any doubts in the mind of either. The ship was evidently deserted.\r\nShe was also as evidently waterlogged. Now they were able to account for\r\nwhat had puzzled them before; her lying so low in the water, and yet at\r\nthe same time seeming so near. Her nearness was not apparent, but real;\r\nher lowness in the water actual, and not seeming. That she had been\r\ndeserted by her crew was more and more evident every moment, for as they\r\ndrew nearer, they could see not a sign of life. Had there been any one\r\non board, he would certainly have made himself visible.\r\n\r\nAt length Bruce bawled out, “Ship, ahoy!”\r\n\r\nBart stopped rowing and looked around. Both boys listened. They did\r\nnot expect any answer, nor did any answer come. They waited for about\r\na minute, and then Bart rowed on. In about two minutes they were\r\nalongside. The oars were thrown in, the boat secured, and the two boys\r\nstepped aboard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0083]\r\n\r\nThere was a mixture of attraction and repulsion in the first sight of\r\nthe ship, which affected the boys very peculiarly. She lay waterlogged.\r\nHer decks were on a level with the sea. But her bulwarks rose six feet\r\nhigh above the water, and the deck itself afforded a spacious area on\r\nwhich to walk. The deck was white with the washing of many waters, and\r\ndry in the warm sun, which had shone upon it for some days past. All\r\nthe boats were gone except one, which hung at the starboard davits, and\r\nlooked like the captain’s gig. The cook’s galley stood amidships, and\r\nastern there was a quarter-deck. The cabin doors were open wide. The\r\nforecastle was also open. The main hatchway was open, and the boys,\r\nlooking in, could see the cargo. It consisted of enormous pine logs.\r\n\r\nThe sight of this cargo explained all. This was a timber ship, no doubt,\r\nfrom Quebec, which had encountered a storm in the gulf, and sprung\r\naleak. On becoming waterlogged, she had been deserted and left to her\r\nfate; yet her cargo, which was of wood, prevented her from sinking,\r\nand the huge sticks of timber served to give her stiffness as well as\r\nbuoyancy, and preserve her from breaking up. To Bart a timber ship was\r\nthe most familiar thing in the world, for he had been brought up in a\r\ntimber port; his father sailed timber ships, and the whole situation was\r\none which he perfectly understood at the very first glance.\r\n\r\nThe boys walked about the decks. To their delight, they saw several\r\nwater casks lashed behind the mainmast, and a row of barrels that\r\nlooked as if they contained provisions, for they all bore the eloquent\r\ninscription:--\r\n\r\nMESS PORK.\r\n\r\nGoing into the cook’s galley, they saw the cooking-stove in good\r\nworking order, and the inmost thought and spontaneous expression of each\r\nwas,--“Won’t Solomon rejoice when he sees this!” They then went aft.\r\n\r\nThey entered the cabin.\r\n\r\nThere was a passage-way about three feet wide. On each side there was\r\na door which was open. Looking in, they saw on one side a room full of\r\nropes, and sails, and oakum, while on the other was another room full of\r\nship’s stores.\r\n\r\nPassing on, they reached the cabin itself. It was a room about twelve\r\nfeet wide and sixteen feet long. A door at one end opened into\r\nanother cabin aft. On the sides of both cabins were doors opening into\r\nstate-rooms. Two of these were very well furnished, and in the after\r\ncabin there was a large and comfortable state-room, which both the boys\r\ndecided to have been the captain’s. The furniture was all confused. The\r\ncarpet was damp. It seemed as though the sea had been careering through\r\nthese cabins and state-rooms. But the upper parts had been spared; and\r\nin the pantry where the boys at length found themselves, they saw, with\r\na pleasure that cannot be described, the contents of the upper shelves\r\nas dry as when they were first put there.\r\n\r\nAt this they rejoiced more than at anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n_Bruce and Bart on board the deserted Ship.--New Discoveries.--The\r\nCook’s Galley.--A sumptuous Repast.--Observations.--A Return\r\nbaffled.--Back again.--The Antelope.--The Ripple in the\r\nWater.--Speculations.--The Sail to the Ship.--Puzzle about the lost\r\nOnes.--Nearer and nearer.--Unexpected and astounding Welcome!_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE state of mind and body in which Bruce and Bart found themselves\r\nwas of such a kind that the discovery of a well-stocked pantry and\r\nstore-room gave them more delight than they had known for a very long\r\ntime. They themselves were ravenously hungry; for the appetite which had\r\nbeen quickened by their long fast had been sharpened by exercise, and\r\nthey also could not forget that their friends on board the Antelope\r\nwere depending upon this expedition as much as themselves. Under such\r\ncircumstances they looked around upon the well stocked shelves, and as,\r\none after another, they recognized well-known and favorite articles of\r\nfood, tears of joy started to their eyes.\r\n\r\nTea, and coffee, and sugar, and butter, and potted meats, and hams, and\r\npickles, and many other delicacies of a similar kind, showed that their\r\npredecessors had not been indifferent to the pleasures of the table. In\r\ntaking leave they seemed to have been very modest in their requirements,\r\nsince they had taken away but little. As they continued their\r\nresearches, they found other articles which increased their delight.\r\nThere were a barrel of apples, boxes of raisins, drums of figs, bags of\r\nnuts, bottles of raspberry vinegar and of lemon sirup, a demijohn full\r\nof lime juice, and a delicious Cheshire cheese. Leaving the pantry and\r\ngoing into another store-room, they saw numerous barrels, some of which\r\ncontained beef, and others pork. Opening another door, they looked in,\r\nand saw a chamber lined with tin and filled with pilot bread.\r\n\r\n“I say, Bruce,” said Bart, “let’s postpone any further searches now, and\r\nget breakfast.”\r\n\r\n“All right. What shall we have?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I feel strongly inclined for some tea, broiled bacon, toasted\r\nbiscuit, and Welsh rarebit.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you add a few other things?” said Bruce, with a laugh. “How\r\ncan we cook anything?”\r\n\r\n“Why, in the cook’s galley.”\r\n\r\n“But there isn’t any fuel.”\r\n\r\n“Why, there’s a lot of coal in that front storeroom, and fagots of wood.\r\nDidn’t you see them?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t notice.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I did, and I’m going to make a fire.”\r\n\r\n“Have you any matches?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you make the fire, and I’ll set the table.”\r\n\r\n“O, no; don’t set the table here. Let’s eat on the quarter-deck. It’s\r\nrather close in here.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; I’ll gather the dishes and eatables.” Bart now went about\r\nhis task. Going into the store-room, he found the fuel, and carrying a\r\nsupply to the cook’s galley, he succeeded in a few minutes in producing\r\na roaring fire. Then he filled the kettle, and before long the water\r\nbegan to boil.\r\n\r\nBy that time Bruce was ready with his part of the business. The teapot\r\nwas brought forward, and the tea set to draw. Then a few slices of\r\nvery superior ham were placed over the coals and broiled. While Bruce\r\nattended to this, Bart soaked some pilot biscuit in water till they were\r\nquite soft, after which he fried them in butter on the stove. He then\r\nproceeded to try his hand at a Welsh rarebit. He cut up some thin slices\r\nof cheese, added butter, and then allowed it all to liquefy over the\r\nfire. Having accomplished this, the two adventurers conveyed their\r\nthings to the quarter-deck, and sat down to breakfast.\r\n\r\nEven had they been less hungry they would have enjoyed that breakfast.\r\nTrue, they had no milk in their tea, but they had long since grown\r\naccustomed, on board the Antelope, to dispense with that. The tea was of\r\na very superior quality, the fried biscuit was most savory, the broiled\r\nham was a great success, and the Welsh rarebit was pronounced delicious.\r\n\r\nAlready they had turned occasional glances over the water, and had seen\r\nthe Antelope, lying apparently three or four miles away, in the same\r\nplace where they had left her. Now, after they had satisfied their\r\nappetites, they began to look at her more closely, and to discuss the\r\ntime of their return. They felt anxious to go back as soon as possible,\r\nbut decided that they might as well postpone it until they were\r\nthoroughly rested.\r\n\r\nIt was evident to the boys that the ship which they had boarded had\r\nbeen deserted very hastily, and they thought that her company must have\r\nboarded some other ship. In this way only could they account for the\r\nnumerous things which had been left behind. Among these was a very\r\ngood spy-glass. Bruce had seen this while preparing breakfast, and had\r\nbrought it on deck with the other things. As they now sat on the deck\r\nafter breakfast, they amused themselves for some time with looking at\r\nthe Antelope. They could see several figures on the deck, but could\r\nnot distinguish one from another. They tried to tell by watching\r\ntheir movements who each one might be. A solitary figure, that stood\r\nmotionless at the stern, they were certain was Captain Corbet, while\r\nanother figure, which indulged in rather eccentric movements, seemed to\r\nbe Solomon. The rest could not be guessed at.\r\n\r\nThey had already found out the name of the ship. They saw it in many\r\nplaces, on a row of buckets that hung in front of the cabin, on the\r\ncaptain’s gig, on the cook’s galley; they saw it engraved on a brass\r\nplate on the cabin door, on the capstan, and on the spy-glass; and this\r\nname, which they thus saw in so many places, was,--\r\n\r\nPETREL, LIVERPOOL.\r\n\r\nIn discussing her fate, they concluded that she had loaded with timber\r\nat Quebec, had encountered a severe gale in the gulf and sprung a leak,\r\nand that another ship had hove in sight, to which the captain and crew\r\nof the Petrel had fled in their boats, without taking anything off their\r\nship. They must have deserted her under the impression that she was\r\ngoing down.\r\n\r\nThus they accounted for the present situation.\r\n\r\nThey decided to leave at eleven o’clock for the Antelope, and return\r\nwith the schooner as soon as possible. Nearly an hour still remained,\r\nand they thought it would be a good idea to prepare the Petrel for the\r\nreception of visitors, so as to afford as cheerful an impression as\r\npossible. This could be effected by making the cabin more “shipshape.”\r\n It seemed to have been entered by rolling seas, for the furniture was\r\nlying confusedly about, and there was some dampness in the air. The\r\nbedding also was all wet. They devoted themselves now to this. They\r\nopened the skylight, so as to secure ventilation, and the stern-ports.\r\nThen they brought all the bedding out, and spread it over the\r\nquarter-deck, where the hot sun and dry wind might do their work.\r\nThen they swept out the cabin, and arranged the furniture as neatly as\r\npossible. At the end of this a great change was produced, and the cabin\r\nof the Petrel assumed an appearance not only of comfort, but almost of\r\ncomparative luxury.\r\n\r\nAt length eleven o’clock came, and they began to prepare for their\r\nreturn to the Antelope. These preparations consisted simply in filling a\r\nbag with pilot bread, and putting this on board the boat; to which they\r\nadded a ham, with some tea, sugar, and butter. They then embarked, and,\r\npushing off, began to row.\r\n\r\nBut scarcely had they rowed a dozen strokes when they became sensible of\r\na breeze. It was a gentle breeze, and it was blowing against them. Bart,\r\nwho was rowing, at once stopped, and Bruce at the same moment uttered\r\na cry which made him look round. It was a joyous sight that they saw--a\r\nsight which assured them that they would be spared the long effort\r\nof pulling back again, for there, away over the water, they saw the\r\nAntelope spreading her white wings to catch the gentle breeze. If that\r\nbreeze continued, it would bring her up to them in an hour, and though\r\nlight, it promised to be steady enough.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if it’s going to last,” asked Bart thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“O, I think so.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it may be as well not to pull any farther just yet.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not. This breeze’ll bring the Antelope here faster than we\r\ncan row towards her, and we will not be gaining enough time to pay for\r\nour trouble.”\r\n\r\n“But the wind might stop, and in that case it Would be a pity to lose\r\nthe time.”\r\n\r\n“O, it can’t be of much consequence. If the wind does die away, we can\r\nstart off. We can watch the Antelope all the time.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bart, “if you’re agreed, I am, I’m sure; and besides,”\r\n he added, “I should like to do a little more to make the Petrel more\r\npresentable, and in better order for receiving our visitors.”\r\n\r\n“Capital,” said Bruce. “I didn’t think of that. Yes, that will be far\r\nbetter than wasting time in unnecessary rowing.”\r\n\r\n“My idea,” said Bart, “is to set the table in the cabin, and cook a\r\nsumptuous breakfast to receive the starving Antelopers.”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” cried Bruce, with enthusiasm; “that’s just the thing.”\r\n\r\n“The cabin’s a little damp, but not so bad as it was, and by the time\r\nthey get here, it’ll be dry enough. They won’t be particular. We’ll set\r\nthe table regularly, bring out the best china, and cook some ham, trot\r\nout some of those potted meats, and have both tea and coffee.”\r\n\r\n“And Welsh rarebit.”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes, if we have time; but the fact is, I wasn’t altogether\r\nsatisfied with my last effort, and we can try it again some other time.”\r\n\r\nThis new project was a most fascinating one to both the boys, who\r\nreturned to the Petrel, and hauled up their boat on the other side, so\r\nthat it could not be seen from the Antelope. This was merely to heighten\r\nthe surprise which they intended to give. They then went to work to\r\nprepare the repast with which they wished to welcome their friends; and\r\ntheir only fear now was that the Antelope would reach them before they\r\nwere ready. Fortunately, this was not the case. The breeze lasted, but\r\nit was light, and the progress of the Antelope, though steady, was slow,\r\nso that the two boys were able to complete their preparations.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the time on board the Antelope had passed very slowly. The\r\nboys had felt full of hope about the result of the expedition of Bart\r\nand Bruce, but they were all ravenously hungry, and hope could not take\r\nthe place of bread and butter. As the time passed they all felt more and\r\nmore impatient, and after they had settled for themselves that the boat\r\nhad reached the ship, they began to look for its return.\r\n\r\nBut from these thoughts they were all roused by a sudden cry of joy.\r\nIt burst forth from Captain Corbet. Every one started and turned to see\r\nwhat had happened. They saw an exhilarating sight, which at once roused\r\nthem from their gloom. There at the stern stood their venerable friend,\r\na smile of exultation on his aged face, tears of joy in his mild eyes,\r\none hand waving his hat in the air, and the other pointing over the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n“It’s come! It’s come! Hooray!”\r\n\r\nThis was what he said, and as he said it the boys looked, and saw\r\nall over the water a gentle ripple. Then they knew it all. The\r\nlong-wished-for wind had at last come, and they were freed from their\r\nlong and irksome imprisonment. In an instant they all rushed to hoist\r\nthe sails. As they hoisted them they felt the gentle air on their faces,\r\nand they saw the sails swelling at its touch. Soon all sail was hoisted,\r\nand Captain Corbet, with an exultant smile, stood once more at the helm,\r\nand the Antelope began to move through the waters.\r\n\r\n“I knowed it,” said he, “I knowed it all along, and I said it, I did.\r\nThat thar wind was bound to come. I felt it in my bones; yea, down to my\r\nbutes. I saw how down in the mouth you all felt, and didn’t like to make\r\nyou too san-goo-wine, but I knowed it, I did, I knowed it, all the same;\r\nand here, it has come at last, sure enough.”\r\n\r\nThe progress of the Antelope was slow, but it was progress, and that was\r\nenough. All the boys stood watching the ship, which they were gradually\r\napproaching. Solomon stood watching with the rest. Once he suggested the\r\nsubject of dinner; but though before the wind came they had all been so\r\nhungry, they seemed now to have lost their appetites. The excitement of\r\nsuspense was too strong, and none of them felt able to eat until they\r\nhad reached the ship, and joined their friends again. And so they moved\r\nslowly over the water.\r\n\r\nThey soon perceived that the ship was not half so far away as they had\r\nsupposed, and then they discovered, not long after, the truth of her\r\nsituation. They could see this better than Bart and Bruce had been able\r\nto do, for they had been sitting low down in a boat, while these were\r\nstanding on the deck, or the taffrail of the schooner, and thus could\r\nmake out the true character of the stranger more easily.\r\n\r\nAs they came within sight, and learned this, they began to look eagerly\r\nabout for signs of life. That the ship was waterlogged they could see,\r\nbut whether there was any one aboard or not they could not see. What had\r\nbecome of the boat? Where were Bruce and Bart? They could see no signs\r\nof any boat whatever. But signs of life at length did appear in the\r\nshape of smoke from the cook’s galley. Arthur, who was examining the\r\nship through the glass, was the first to detect this, and it was not\r\nlong before all the boys could see it with the naked eye. Smoke of\r\nitself would have indicated human life; but smoke from the cook’s galley\r\nindicated something more, and was eloquently suggestive of those joys of\r\nthe table to which they had too long been strangers. It served to assure\r\nthem that their difficulties were approaching an end, and that smoke\r\nfrom the cook’s galley was of itself enough to drive away the last\r\nvestige of despondency.\r\n\r\nBut, in the mean while, what had become of Bruce and Bart? That was the\r\nquestion which every one asked himself, without being able to answer.\r\nWhere was the boat? They could not see it anywhere. Could the boys have\r\ngone on board the ship? They must have done so. The water had been too\r\ncalm to admit of the probability of any evil happening to them. They\r\nmust have boarded the ship.\r\n\r\nBut where were Bruce and Bart now?\r\n\r\nNo one could tell.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope drew steadily nearer, and all on board watched with\r\nindescribable eagerness the strange ship. Now they could see her\r\ndisordered rigging, her yards bare of sails, her open hatchway. They\r\ncould see bedding lying on the quarter-deck, and the open skylight.\r\nAll these things indicated life on board; yet of that life there was no\r\nother sign. Where was the captain? Where were the crew? Where was the\r\ncook, who kept up such a roaring fire? It was all a puzzle. Above all.\r\nwhere were Bruce and Bart? Who could tell?\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer.\r\n\r\nEvery moment brought them closer, but disclosed no living being.\r\n\r\nSolomon crept up slowly to Arthur, and gently touched his arm.\r\n\r\nArthur started, and turned.\r\n\r\n“Hallo, Solomon! what’s the matter with you?”\r\n\r\n“Mas’r Atta, I donno bout dis yer craft,” said Solomon, in a tremulous\r\nvoice, with his eyes rolling wildly.\r\n\r\n“Why, what’s the matter?” asked Arthur, in surprise.\r\n\r\n“Donno; dar’s somethin drefful curous bout dis yer craft,--beats all\r\neber I see,--floatin under water; full ub water, an not sinkin; fire a\r\nburnin like de old boy in de cook’s galley, an not a livin man aboard. I\r\ndon’t like it. Tell you what, now, I don’t like it.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! nonsense,” said Arthur. “Don’t be absurd, Solomon. You’ll take\r\nyour turn in that cook’s galley, perhaps, before sundown, and make\r\nacquaintance with the cook of the ship.”\r\n\r\nSolomon shuddered and shook his head.\r\n\r\nThey were now within a stone’s throw of the ship.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Captain Corbet, put both hands to his mouth, holding the tiller\r\nbetween his legs, and shouted, in a loud voice,--\r\n\r\n“Ship, ahoy!”\r\n\r\nThen came an answer.\r\n\r\nAt last!\r\n\r\nAnd what an answer!\r\n\r\nOut of the cabin bounded two well-known forms. They rushed out dancing,\r\nand capering, and flinging their hats in the air. They shouted, and\r\nyelled, and hurrahed. They ran up to the quarter-deck, and repeated\r\nthese actions there. Those on board the Antelope were so astounded that\r\nthey looked on in dumb bewilderment.\r\n\r\n“Haul up alongside!” cried Bruce. “Fetch her round! I’m captain of this\r\ncraft, and Bart is mate; I’m steward, and he’s cook; I’m boatswain,\r\nand he’s the crew. Hurrah! Haul up alongside, and heave us a line, my\r\nhearties.”\r\n\r\nIt was some time before Captain Corbet could recover sufficiently from\r\nhis bewilderment to be capable of doing anything. Half mechanically he\r\nmanaged to bring the Antelope around, and man-. aged it just in time\r\nto cause her to move gently up alongside. Wade, who had all along been\r\nperfectly stolid, then proceeded to secure the schooner to the ship\r\nin the most matter-of-fact way in the world, just as if he had been\r\nsecuring her to the wharf in Grand Pré. But long before he had taken the\r\nfirst turn in the rope, the boys had bounded on board the Petrel, and\r\nproceeded to overwhelm Bruce and Bart with countless questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n_All aboard.--A Welcome of the best Kind.--The Invitation.--The\r\nBanquet.--Amazement of the Visitors.--The Repast.--Solomon in\r\nhis Glory.--The Manuscript found in a Bottle.--The Fate of the\r\nPetrel.--Captain Corbet has an Idea.--He begins to brood over it.--A\r\nQuestion of Salvage.--How to make one’s Fortune._\r\n\r\n\r\nGRADUALLY they became acquainted with the whole truth of the situation.\r\nThey had thought thus far that the ship, though waterlogged, was still in\r\nthe possession of her captain and crew. Boundless was their astonishment\r\nat learning that it was in the possession of Bruce and Bart alone, and\r\nthe astonishment which they experienced at this amazing discovery for\r\na time drove away all other thoughts. But Nature at length asserted her\r\nsupremacy, and the pangs of hunger, for some time past kept in abeyance,\r\nnow awaked in full force.\r\n\r\n“Haven’t you found anything to eat?” asked Arthur, in a low voice,\r\ntremulous with emotion.\r\n\r\nBruce did not reply, but looked at Bart. The other boys turned pale. For\r\na moment the awful thought occurred that there was nothing; but the next\r\ninstant there was wafted to their nostrils the savory odor of broiled\r\nham, which overpowered that mournful thought, and drove it away\r\neffectually.\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t know,” said Bart, “but that we may manage to scare up\r\nsomething. I suppose you’re not very particular. Come in here, and I’ll\r\nsee what I can do for you.”\r\n\r\nWith these words he entered the cabin, and all the others followed.\r\n\r\nOne by one they entered the cabin, and one by one each, as he entered,\r\nstood rooted to the spot, and stared around in dumb amazement. Captain\r\nCorbet came last. He took one look, and then exclaimed, in a low,\r\nprolonged, and tremulous voice,--\r\n\r\n“Good gerracious!”\r\n\r\nAnd indeed there was every reason for surprise. They had come in\r\nexpecting to enter the ruinous cabin of a half-wrecked ship, with\r\nperhaps a few mouldy ship’s biscuit to be divided among the hungry\r\ncompany. Instead of this they saw a table set out to its fullest extent,\r\nwith a white cloth spread, and on that table a repast which was nothing\r\nless than sumptuous. Tea, coffee, biscuit hard and toasted, Welsh\r\nrarebit, broiled ham, potted shrimps, game pie, pickled oysters,\r\nlobster, potted salmon, tomatoes, potatoes hot, steaming, and mealy,\r\napples, raisins, nuts, figs, raspberry vinegar, lemon sirup, and\r\nnumerous other dainties which Bart and Bruce had discovered and drawn\r\nforth from the rich store that lay accumulated in the pantry of the\r\nPetrel. The lavish abundance of everything, as well as the astonishing\r\nvariety, overwhelmed the hungry new comers, and, except the exclamation\r\nof Captain Corbet, not one word was spoken. It was a moment when words\r\nwere useless.\r\n\r\nFor an instant or so Bruce and Bart enjoyed the astonishment of their\r\nfriends, and watched the effect with a triumphant smile. They had\r\nbeen purposely lavish in this first entertainment of theirs, and had\r\nsucceeded in placing upon the table a specimen of every individual\r\narticle for food or drink which the ship contained. They had worked hard\r\nin anticipation of this moment, and now that it had come, they found it\r\na complete success.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Bruce, at last, “you can’t eat with your eyes, you know.\r\nCome, noble captain, do you preside at this festive board. Tom, sit on\r\nthe captain’s right, Bart on his left. I’ll take the foot of the table,\r\nwith Phil on my right. Ward, my bold mate, sit next to Bart; Pat and\r\nPhil, fall in. Solomon, you go and install yourself in the cook’s\r\ngalley, where you’ll find as much as you can eat for the rest of the\r\nday.”\r\n\r\nUpon this they all took their places, and began to eat with appetites\r\nsuch as those only can possess who have fasted for twenty-four hours on\r\nthe sea. Bart and Bruce had already satisfied their own wants; so while\r\ntheir friends were eating they gave a full, complete, and exhaustive\r\naccount of their own adventures, and their doings aboard of the Petrel.\r\n\r\nThe dinner passed off most delightfully, and a far longer time was spent\r\nat the table than the boys generally gave to their repast. Ample justice\r\nwas done to the bountiful and varied supply that graced the board.\r\nAfter the first pangs of hunger were appeased, there were a thousand new\r\nquestions to be asked and answered, in addition to those which they had\r\nalready made. Captain Corbet alone said nothing. He sat and ate, and\r\nlistened, and from time to time leaned back in his chair with a sigh of\r\nhappiness, and surveyed the company with a smile that spoke of inward\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n“My dear young ferriends,” said the venerable captain, at length, taking\r\nadvantage of an opening in the conversation to express his feelings, “it\r\nis with feelings of no ordinary deskeription that I now address you.\r\nWe have sailed over the briny and billowy main far and wide, and have\r\nencountered parls and dangers more’n any ordinary people, but never have\r\nwe been in such a position, or reduced to such extremities, as in these\r\nlast few days. And now look at us. Here we air. What kind of an abode is\r\nthis? Is it a ship? Scacely. Is it a island? Not quite. It’s enchanted\r\ngerround! Here we air, an we’ve been led by the kind hand of Providence\r\nto this secluded spot in the midst of the wide waste of waters. We come\r\nhere in a state of starvation, with our minds in a kine of despair;\r\nwe come here, and we found, as it were, a table spread for us in\r\nthe wilderness. So far, so good; and I know, my dear young Christian\r\nferriends, you all rejice with me, and feel as I do, full of gladness\r\nand gerratitood. But secondly, my dear ferriends,” continued the\r\ncaptain, insensibly increasing his tone and manner to a sermonizing\r\nintensity, “there air things about this here craft, that begin to occur\r\nto my mind, that go beyond the present fleetin moment, and interweave\r\nthemselves with our footoor destiny. I ain’t a goin to say jest now what\r\nthese things air, but I want, fust and foremost, to browse round, and\r\ninspect, and cogitate, and meditate, till I kin hit on some kind of a\r\nplan for workin out what I want. I’ll tell you when I get it all thought\r\nout, but for the present I am dumb.”\r\n\r\nAfter this very mysterious conclusion, Captain Corbet rose and left the\r\ncabin. For the remainder of the day he kept by himself. He wandered\r\nall over the ship, and inspected every part most carefully. Then he\r\nretreated to the quarter-deck, and, seating himself there, lost himself\r\nin his own absorbing thoughts. What he was thinking about the boys did\r\nnot know, nor did any of them inquire; for they were all far too much\r\ntaken up with the novelty of the situation to pay any attention to him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Solomon had followed the commands of Bruce, and had taken\r\nhimself off to the cook’s galley. There, two hours afterwards, on\r\nleaving the cabin, the boys found him. He had that expression on his\r\nface, and had installed himself in that particular attitude, which might\r\nhave belonged to one who had lived and labored here for years. He had\r\neaten a huge repast, and was meditating over a roaring fire.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah, Solomon,” said Bart, who was the first to visit him. “How goes\r\nit, my prince of darkies? This is a little ahead of the Antelope--isn’t\r\nit? Now you can begin to live again; and I tell you what, you’ll find\r\nenough stuff aft there to give us a first-rate bill of fare every day,\r\nand different every time.”\r\n\r\nSolomon jumped up with a grin..\r\n\r\n“Is de dinna oba, Mas’r Bart?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“O, yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, den, I mus go aft an clar away de tings, and spect for myself, to\r\nsee what we got roun us in dis yer craft. I been a tryin to cogitate an\r\ncontrive for suppa, but I can’t manage it nohow till I know zacly what I\r\ngot to put my ole hands un. I s’pose you’ll take all de tings aboard de\r\nAntelope right away?\r\n\r\n“Aboard the Antelope? Indeed, we don’t intend to do anything of the\r\nkind.”\r\n\r\n“Why, what are you a goin to do?”\r\n\r\n“Do? Why, we’ll stay here for ever so long. It’s a kind of desert\r\nisland, you know--only it’s ten times better.”\r\n\r\nThe rest of the boys now came streaming forward, wandering all over\r\nthe ship. Solomon went to the cabin, while Bart and Bruce proceeded to\r\nexamine the mattresses. These were very much dryer than they had been,\r\nbut still were so damp that several of them would require two or three\r\ndays to become fit to sleep on. Others, however, were already nearly fit\r\nfor use. Bart noticed that the wet ones came from the port side of the\r\nship, and he remembered that the state-rooms on that side were much\r\ndamper than those on the other. Water seemed to have penetrated there.\r\nHe accounted for this on the supposition that this had been the leeward\r\nside in a gale, and, when the ship was filling, it had lain low down,\r\nand had received the washings of the waves. Fortunately, the storeroom\r\nand the pantry were on the other side, and thus their contents\r\nhad escaped without injury. But the wet mattresses themselves were\r\nafterwards taken in hand by Solomon, who opened them, and dried their\r\ncontents partly in front of the galley stove and partly in the open air.\r\nTo assist in this process he kindled a roaring fire in the cabin, which\r\nserved a double purpose, for it not only dried the mattresses but it\r\nalso dried the cabin itself, and drove away the last vestige of dampness\r\nfrom the state-rooms on the port side.\r\n\r\nWhile busy in one of these, Bart saw a bottle lying on the floor. It\r\nwas corked. On taking it up, he held it to the light to see what liquid\r\nmight be inside. To his surprise he saw no liquid, but some folded\r\npaper. With a loud cry he rushed forth upon deck, displaying his bottle,\r\nand calling upon all the boys to come.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the eager boys had all collected around Bart, and even\r\nCaptain Corbet was roused from his abstraction, and came to the centre\r\nof interest.\r\n\r\n“Has any one a corkscrew?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\n“There’s one in the pantry,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“I’ll go and get it,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said Tom; “break the bottle. You’ll never get at the paper if\r\nyou don’t.”\r\n\r\n“Sure enough,” said Bart; and the next instant he struck the bottle\r\nagainst an iron belaying-pin, and shivered it to atoms. The paper fell\r\non the deck.\r\n\r\nBart snatched it up, and opened it. It was a piece of coarse paper, that\r\nlooked as though it had been hastily torn from some book. On it some\r\nwriting was hurriedly scrawled with a pencil. It was as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Ship Petrel, of Liverpool, from Quebec, with timeber. Fog for two\r\nweeks, and violent gales. Lost reckoning. Took an observation last in\r\nlat. 46° 5’ 22”, long. 59° 8’ 2”. Ship waterlogged, on beam-ends, and\r\ngoing to pieces. Taking to boats.\r\n\r\nHenry Hall, Master._\r\n\r\nThere was another scrawl that seemed intended for a date, but the boys\r\ncould not make it out. It looked like “Tuesday, March,” but it might\r\nhave been anything else.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the writing. The captain had believed that the ship was\r\nactually going to pieces, and had hurried off evidently in the greatest\r\npossible haste, and had probably thrown into the boats a few of the\r\nbarest necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nBut Bart suggested another theory. It was that the captain had put this\r\nwriting in the bottle, and had got it all ready to throw over, when\r\nperhaps a sail had hove in sight, and thus the bottle had been left in\r\nthe cabin.\r\n\r\nAnother theory was, that, in his hurry or panic, he had forgotten all\r\nabout the bottle, which had floated about in the cabin, and been left in\r\none of the state-rooms by the retreating waves.\r\n\r\nIt was evident to all that the captain, “Henry Hall,” had lost his\r\nhead. In his terror he had believed that the ship was “going to pieces;”\r\n whereas nothing of the sort was going on. She might possibly have been\r\non her beam-ends, since he said so, but even here his fears might have\r\nexaggerated the danger. Captain Corbet thought that she had been struck\r\nover on her beam-ends, and held down by her sails, and, when these were\r\ntorn away, she had eventually righted herself.\r\n\r\n“That thar skipper,” said he, sententiously, “was frikened out of his\r\nseven senses, and fancied the craft was brakin up. So he rushed to the\r\nboats, chucked in a bag of biscuit and a few bottles of water, and rowed\r\naway for his life.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet paused for a moment, and looked at the boys with a very\r\nsingular expression on his face.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said he, “my dear young friends, do you know what you air and\r\nwhat you’ve ben an gone an done?”\r\n\r\n“What?” asked Bruce, in some surprise at the captain’s tone and manner.\r\n\r\n“Wal, only this--you’re salvors.”\r\n\r\n“Salvors!” repeated Bruce, to whom this word conveyed no meaning in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\n“Salvors!” repeated Captain Corbet, impressively. “Yes, you’ve found\r\nthis here ship on the broad bosom of the deep, deserted; you’ve took\r\npossession--she’s yours.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what of that?” said Bruce. “For that matter, she belongs to all\r\nof us.”\r\n\r\n“She belongs to all them that bear a hand to bring her into port.”\r\n\r\n“Into port!” cried Bart, in great surprise.\r\n\r\n“Yes, into port,” said Captain Corbet. “That thar was the very fust idee\r\nthat entered into my head as I sot foot on this here deck. This noble\r\nship, this valable cargo,--is this to be given up, or surrendered to the\r\ntender mussies of the pitiless and ragin ocean? Not if I knows it. If\r\nwe can manage to navigate this here craft into port, she’s ours! We can\r\nsell her. We can sell her cargo. It’s a val’able cargo. It’ll give each\r\nof us enough, if the proceeds air divided, to set us up for life. For\r\nmy part, I’m an old man, with one foot in the grave; but I never forget\r\nthat I am a feyther, and never did the parential heart beat more wildly\r\nthan it did at the identical moment when this thought came like fire\r\ninto my brain. That’s so.”\r\n\r\n“But how in the world can we get her into port?” cried Bart, in\r\nastonishment and excitement.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said Captain Corbet, “that thar’s the very identical pint that\r\nI’ve been a cogitatin over the hull arternoon. I’ve gone about this here\r\ncraft on all sides, an I’ve sot an surveyed her from a distance.\r\nI’ve shot my eyes an meditated her all over. But thar’s one grand and\r\noverpeowerin obstacle in the way to a fair navigation, and that is, she\r\nhasn’t got a rag of a sail except that jib.”\r\n\r\n“‘So what can we do?” said Bruce. “We can’t get her to move an inch\r\nwithout sails.”\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t we rig up the sails of the Antelope?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shook his head mildly.\r\n\r\n“’Tain’t possible,” said he, “no how. Fust an foremost, the spread\r\nof canvas on the schewner ain’t over an above sufficient to fetch her\r\nalong, and on this here ship it wouldn’t be a succumstance. Why, this\r\nhere ship is a thousand tonner, an more too. Besides,” added the\r\nvenerable captain, with mild suggestiveness, “the canvas of the Antelope\r\n_might_ be stronger.”\r\n\r\nThis was a statement the truth of which was at once felt and\r\nacknowledged by all the boys.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said Captain Corbet, “there ain’t no use doin things up in a\r\nhurry--not a mite. We’ve got to deliberate, cogitate, turn it all over\r\nin our minds, and be precious keerful how we decide. There’s a good deal\r\nat stake, and this here hour may be a goin to make or mar our fortins. I\r\nintend to brood over it this night, an p’aps by mornin I’ll see my way.\r\nThe only trouble is,” he added, in a pensive tone, “that I don’t quite\r\nknow how I can ever see my way to navigatin this here vessel without\r\nsails.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps we can drift to some place,” suggested Phil.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet looked at Phil for a few moments with mild astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Have you ever tried driftin, young sir?” he asked, at length.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Phil, “except with you, in the Antelope.”\r\n\r\n“Yea, and in the Bay of Fundy. Now, if this was only the Bay of Fundy,\r\nI’d feel at home. In that thar bay I’d ventoor to cal’late the exact\r\npoint to which this here ship would drift. But this ain’t the Bay of\r\nFundy, and, what’s more, I don’t understand the currents of these here\r\nwaters,--more’s the pity, bein as I’m a pilgerrim an a stranger. As to\r\ndriftin, why, we’ll drift, course, as long as we’re aboard; but where we\r\nmay drift to it would take a man with a head as long as a horse to tell.\r\nWhy, we might drift to Portygal, and that, I think, wouldn’t quite meet\r\nthe voos of any of us. I’ve knowed, or leastways I’ve heerd tell of\r\nships that’s gone all the way over to Portygal, partly driftin, partly\r\nby the wind a blowin of ‘em. But this here ship I want to indooce to go\r\nto some home port,--and how to do that is the puzzle that now occoopies\r\nthis bewildered brain.”\r\n\r\nWith these words the captain gently passed away from the group of\r\nboys, leaving them to think over and to talk over this new and exciting\r\nproject. It was in conversation about this and about the message in the\r\nbottle, that they occupied themselves till bedtime.\r\n\r\nThat night they concluded to sleep in their old quarters on board the\r\nAntelope, as the beds and bedding in the cabin of the Petrel were not\r\ndry enough to satisfy the mind of Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n_Solomon in his Glory.--The Breakfast a splendid Success.--Out of\r\nStarvation and into the Land of Plenty.--Removal of Lodgings.--The\r\nQuestion of Salvage.--An important Debate.--To go or not to\r\ngo.--Dropping Anchor.--The final Departure.--Corbet bids a fond\r\nFarewell.--Alone in the Water-logged Ship._\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was late on the following morning when they awoke. The effect\r\nof fatigue and excitement, together with perfect peace of mind, all\r\nconspired to make their sleep sound and refreshing. Solomon alone was\r\nup early; but it was nine o’clock before they sat down to the sumptuous\r\nbreakfast which he had prepared in the cabin of the Petrel.\r\n\r\nSolomon had found himself in command of a very well appointed larder,\r\nand he showed no inclination to spare it. He seemed to be endeavoring\r\nto make amends for his enforced idleness of the past few days by\r\nextraordinary activity and fruitfulness of invention in the culinary\r\ndepartment. There was no lack of anything which the ship could supply;\r\nnay? there was even more than any of the boys had expected, for, to the\r\namazement of all, they saw on the table before them several dishes\r\nof hot rolls; for Solomon had discovered among the ship’s stores some\r\nbarrels of flour, and had at once made a raid upon these. He laid before\r\nthem coffee, tea, hot rolls, delicious fish-balls, broiled ham, stewed\r\ntomatoes, baked potatoes, with a variety of potted meats, prepared in\r\nmanifold ways by his skilful hand.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast was a splendid success. It made all of them more delighted\r\nthan ever with their situation. In fact, about that situation there was\r\nnow an air of luxury; and the first determination of all of them was\r\nto move, bag and baggage, on board the Petrel, and live there. Solomon\r\nassured them that before the next evening all the bedding would be\r\nso dry that the most delicate invalid might sleep upon any one of the\r\nmattresses without fear. The boys, therefore, made their decision at\r\nonce. They determined to take up their lodgings on board the Petrel, and\r\nproceeded to select state-rooms. As there was some difference in these\r\napartments, they decided that the fairest way would be to draw lots.\r\nCaptain Corbet positively refused to leave the Antelope, and so did\r\nWade; so the boys had it all to themselves. Pat and Phil drew the\r\nbest room (the captain’s); Bart and Tom drew the next best, which was\r\napparently the mate’s; while Bruce and Arthur had the choice of any\r\none out of the four remaining ones. All, however, were sufficiently\r\ncomfortable to satisfy the most exacting, and none of the party had any\r\ncause to find fault with the result. Then followed the removal of their\r\nsimple baggage, after which the boys began to “fix up” their respective\r\nstate-rooms with as much care and labor as though they proposed spending\r\nthe rest of the summer on board.\r\n\r\nThese preparations did not take up much time; and before long they\r\nwere all out on deck inspecting the bedding, and examining how far the\r\nvarious mattresses were prepared for being restored to their places. But\r\nit was decided to leave all these for the day, until Solomon should be\r\nready to make the beds.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful day. The sky was without a cloud, blue and glorious.\r\nThe sun shone down warmly and brilliantly. There was a gentle breeze,\r\nwhich tossed up the water into wavelets without making much motion, a\r\nbreeze which was sufficient for the tranquil movement of some pleasure\r\nyacht, and not strong enough to excite any fear. There was a freshness\r\nin the atmosphere which was most exhilarating. The air was clear and\r\ntransparent. Wide around lay the waste of waters, upon which not a\r\nsingle sail was visible.\r\n\r\nSolomon cleared away the table, and then relapsed into the galley. The\r\nboys gathered into a little group upon the quarter-deck. To them thus\r\nassembled appeared the form of the venerable Corbet, a smile on his\r\nlips, a glance of benignity in his eyes.\r\n\r\n“It’s all about this here salvage,” he began, somewhat abruptly. “You\r\nsee, boys, I’ve ben a thinkin an a dreamin, asleep an awake, all night\r\nlong, an my pinion is more an more that we hadn’t ort, none of us, to\r\nlose this present blessed chance, if we can possibly make anythin out of\r\nit. I’ve ben a cal’latin the valoo of this here ship an cargo. Now, this\r\nhere ship must have cost at least fifteen thousand pounds. Of course she\r\nain’t wuth that much now, an I can’t tell what she is wuth till I know\r\nwhat damage she’s received. At any rate, she’s wuth a good deal. As for\r\nher cargo, why, that’s jest as good as the day it was put inside of her.\r\nTimber ain’t like grain or cotton; it don’t spile. Here, then, we have a\r\ncouple of thousand tons or so of fust-rate white pine timber, wuth lots\r\nof money, and we have this ship, wuth thousands of pounds. Why, boys, at\r\nthe smallest cal’lation, the proceeds of the sale of this here ship and\r\ncargo would amount to over a thousand pounds apiece for every one of us,\r\nincludin Solomon.\r\n\r\n“’Tain’t myself I’m a thinkin on,” resumed the captain, after a pause,\r\nin a tone of mild melancholy, and with a pensive sigh; “’tain’t myself\r\nat all. I’m old, sere, an yaller. I don’t want money; I got enough for\r\nall my needs and pupposes. But it’s the babby, dear boys, the babby.\r\nThat thar infant is the true cause of my present wanderin life. He\r\ndrives me to the ocean wave when I might be toastin my shins in front of\r\nmy own stove. I want to airn somethin to leave to him when I’m dead\r\nan gone. I got the house an the farm; but I want somethin more for the\r\ninfant. All my cares are for him. I don’t want to leave him to the cold\r\nworld, to sturruggle an to sturrive. I want to give him a eddication, to\r\nmake a man of him an a scholyer, a joy to his parient, and an honor to\r\nhis country.\r\n\r\n“Wal, now’s the chance. Here we have it thrown into our very hands.\r\nWe’ve got it, an all we’ve got to do is to make use of it. Here’s this\r\nhere ship an cargo. If we can only get her into some port, it’ll be wuth\r\nover a thousand pounds apiece to every one of us, Solomon included. Each\r\none of you boys’ll have enough, dear knows, to keep you in pocket-money\r\nall your born days, or to buy you a fine schewner all to yourself.\r\nSolomon’ll have enough to raise him far above the humble attitood of\r\na ship’s cook; an I will have enough to raise the babby above want, an\r\nrair him to be a gentleman an a scholyer.”\r\n\r\nPartly from the idea of getting plenty of pocket-money, partly to help\r\nold Solomon, partly to assist the respected Corbet in acquiring the\r\nmeans of giving an “eddication” to the “babby,” but more than all\r\nbecause they were moved by his earnestness, the boys universally chimed\r\nin with his wishes, and urged him most enthusiastically to do all\r\nthat he could to save the ship. Captain Corbet listened with his usual\r\nmildness, and then suggested that perhaps there might be some sails\r\nstowed away on board; upon which he at once went off to search for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHis search, however, was not successful. One sail was found, but it was\r\nquite inadequate to the needs of the ship. It really seemed to be, as\r\nthe captain asserted, that the Petrel had encountered violent gales, in\r\nwhich her sails had been lost, and all her spare ones made use of only\r\nto be lost in turn. Certain it was that, though of other things there\r\nwas no lack, of sails there was a total want; and the discovery of this\r\nreduced Captain Corbet once more to his former meditative mood.\r\n\r\nWhile Captain Corbet thus meditated, the boys talked over the situation.\r\nIf sails were wanted, it seemed to them that the best thing that could\r\nbe done would be for some one to go and get them. There was wind enough.\r\nThe Magdalen Islands were not far away, and no doubt a sufficient supply\r\ncould be obtained there. Some one might remain on board the Petrel. The\r\nquestion then arose, Who should go and who should stay? As to that there\r\nwas no doubt. Every one of the boys determined to stick to the Petrel at\r\nall hazards, and thus Captain Corbet himself could go in the Antelope.\r\n\r\nIt was with words to this effect that Bart broke in upon the musings of\r\nCaptain Corbet.\r\n\r\nThe captain listened to his remarks, and, though he was evidently struck\r\nby them, still there arose in his mind certain scruples, which under the\r\ncircumstances were very natural.\r\n\r\n“O, no! no, no!” said he; “railly, now, you mustn’t try to persuade me.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“O, it would never do!”\r\n\r\n“Do? Yes, it would.”\r\n\r\n“O, I couldn’t bring myself to leave youns! Who could tell what might\r\nhappen!”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! Are we babies? Can’t we take care of ourselves? Of course we\r\ncan! We’ve been in far worse situations than this. Think of what we’ve\r\nall gone through at different times! Think in particular of Tom and\r\nPhil, what they’ve gone through! Are we the fellows that could meet with\r\nany harm if you were to leave us?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you air; it’s jest that,” said Captain Corbet. “You’ve all got\r\na natral-born, innate talent for gettin into difficulties. You don’t\r\ncaitch me lettin you go out of my sight.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” said Bart. “See here, now, captain. There isn’t and there\r\ncan’t be the slightest danger. It’s all safe. We’ll be as safe here\r\nas if we were on an island. This ship? can never sink. Why, I know all\r\nabout these timber ships. My father owned one that got waterlogged just\r\nlike this, in the middle of winter, in the Atlantic, and in the course\r\nof several tremendous gales she was blown over, to Europe. Mind you, she\r\ncouldn’t sink. She got into Liverpool, and was broken up there, and her\r\ncargo was sold for the benefit of the underwriters. Captain Beyea, who\r\ncommanded her, told me all about it. Of course at this season of the\r\nyear we’re all right, for there’s no likelihood of any storms; and\r\nbesides, you’ll only be gone a few days.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet did not answer for some time.\r\n\r\n“O, boys,” he said, at length, in a hesitating way, “if you only could!\r\nIf I only dar’d!”\r\n\r\n“If we only could?” said Bruce. “Why, captain, you don’t seem to know\r\nus! You think that we’re a parcel of helpless children.”\r\n\r\n“I only wish,” said Tom, “that I may never have anything worse to do\r\nthan to stay in a place like this--a floating palace, where we feed on\r\nthe fat of the land. When I think of Ilee Haute, I consider this a sort\r\nof Paradise.”\r\n\r\n“I think I have known worse places,” said Phil. “I could tell you of\r\na burning forest, in comparison with which every other situation\r\nisn’t worth being mentioned. Why, boys, this is going to be a sort of\r\npicnic--a pleasure party.”\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said Arthur, “we are all settled here now. Each of us has his\r\nstate-room. We’ve got plenty of provisions. We’ve made up our minds to\r\nspend a couple of weeks here at least. So you may as well knock under.\r\nWhile we’re aboard, it will be much better for you to go off, and try to\r\nget some sails, than to wander up and down, moping, day after day, with\r\nthe Antelope alongside doing nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, an it’s meself,” said Pat, “that would be willing to sail off in\r\nthe Antelope single-handed, if Captain Corbet is afraid, only I’ll want\r\none man to give a hand in navigatin, so I will.”\r\n\r\n“O, two could easily sail the Antelope,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“And what shall Solomon do?” asked Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Do?” said Bart. “Why, he’ll stay with us. What could we do without\r\nSolomon? We need him here more than anywhere else. Without him our life\r\nhere would become flat and insipid. I could do the cooking once; but as\r\na general thing, I should beg to be excused. Without Solomon we should\r\nnot be able to eat.”\r\n\r\n‘“Yes, yes,” said Captain Corbet, meditatively. “Thar’s no trouble about\r\nme an Wade navigatin the Antelope. We don’t want Solomon. He’ll be best\r\nhere with youns. If I could only leave you--”\r\n\r\n“But that’s already settled,” said Bart, decisively. “You are going to\r\nleave us.”\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said Captain Corbet, “here we air, some-whar nigh onto fifty mile\r\nnorth of the Magdalen Islands. I steered doo north; an I don’t think\r\nwe’ve made much of a muve since the calm began. Now, my idee is, that\r\nif we were to drop anchor here, this here craft would stay till I come\r\nback, an I know I could find her easy.”\r\n\r\n“Drop anchor? Of course,” said Bart. “I didn’t think of that. In fact,\r\nthis was my only trouble--the possibility of drifting from this place.\r\nBut if we were to drop anchor, why, of course it stands to reason that\r\nwe shouldn’t move from this place; and so, of course, you could find us\r\nagain, as you say, without any difficulty.”\r\n\r\n“Her anchors air all right,” said Captain Corbet. “I’ve seen em. There’s\r\nsixty fathom of chain if there’s an inch.”\r\n\r\n“Well, come now. We’d better drop anchor at once,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“You tempt me, boys,” said Captain Corbet, with evident emotion. “You\r\ntempt me awful. I feel as though I hadn’t ought to go; but you’ve got a\r\nkind of a sort of a way of puttin things that makes it seem all so safe,\r\nan pleasant, an easy like that I’ve half a mind to resk it, an go off at\r\nall hazards. For there’s so much at stake! My babby! He pulls even now\r\nat my paternal heart-strings! His voice, even now, is a soundin in my\r\naged ear! ‘Father,’ he seems to say, ‘go off, an hurry up with them thar\r\nsails.’ An then,” continued the captain, after a pause, everything seems\r\nfavorable. The breeze is fair; the sea is calm; the sky is blue; an I’ll\r\nonly be gone a couple of days at the farthest. ’Tain’t likely there’ll\r\nbe another calm. The wind is fair for the Magdalen Islands. There’s\r\nprovisions enough aboard here for months: An, as you say, there railly\r\nain’t any danger.\r\n\r\n“You’re quite right, Bart. This here ship can never sink. Her timber\r\ncargo’ll keep her afloat till dumesday, an, what’s more, it’ll hold her\r\ntogether. An I’ve so much at stake! The babby! His fortune may now be\r\nmade. It needs only one bold stroke, an all is done. Then we have the\r\nship for our own, an the cargo, an we’ll sell em both, an divide the\r\nproceeds. It’ll be more’n a thousand pounds apiece, an the babby’ll be\r\nindependent. He can receive a college eddication; he can grow up to be\r\na gentleman an a scholyer; an he’ll live to bless the memory of the aged\r\nparient who now doos violence to his own conscience for the sake of the\r\nfootor interests of his offspring. Yes, yes, it must be done. An, boys,\r\nI rayther guess, on the whole, that p’aps I’d best go, as you say.”\r\n\r\nThe decision of the captain thus announced was received with acclamation\r\nby the boys, and these marks of approval served to drive away the last\r\nvestige of hesitation from Captain Corbet’s mind.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said he, “if we’re goin to do it, we’d best do it as soon as\r\npossible. So, fust an foremost, we’d best let go the anchor.”\r\n\r\nCalling Wade, the captain then went forward, followed by all the boys.\r\n\r\nThe anchor was let go.\r\n\r\nRattle, rattle, rattle went chain and windlass, and at length the anchor\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n“That’ll hold, I guess,” said the captain, “Now you’re hard an fast. Now\r\nI’ll know where to find you. You’re no longer aboard a ship. You’re on\r\na fixed and immovable spot,--an island of the sea,--an here you’ll stay\r\npatient and quiet till I come back.”\r\n\r\nThese remarks the boys heard with the utmost placidity, and accepted\r\nthem as absolute fact.. They had flung themselves headlong into this\r\nsomewhat dangerous project, and were now more eager than ever for its\r\nsuccessful completion.\r\n\r\nAfter letting go the anchor, the next thing was to prepare the Antelope\r\nfor her trip.\r\n\r\n“We’re out of provisions, boys, over there,” said the captain, “as you\r\nmay, perhaps, be aware, an we’ll have to make a re-qui-sition on you. We\r\ndon’t want much; none o’ yer potted meats an chicken-fixins; none o’ yer\r\nluxoories an sweetmeats. All we want is a modest supply of good honest\r\nbiscuit, with a little pork, a ham or two, an a pinch of sugar, an a\r\ndrawin o’ tea. Wade an me, we don’t go in for scientific cookery; we\r\nonly want somethin to chaw at odd times.”\r\n\r\nThey now proceeded to transfer to the Antelope a sufficient supply of\r\nfood. All the boys lent a hand. A dozen hams, a barrel of pork, a barrel\r\nof beef, and six barrels of ship bread were put on board the schooner,\r\nin spite of the remonstrances of the captain, who assured them that they\r\nonly wanted a tenth part of all these stores. But the boys would not be\r\nbalked in their hospitable intentions.\r\n\r\nAt length the stores were all on board the Antelope, and nothing more\r\nremained to be done. The last moment had come. Captain Corbet was deeply\r\naffected, and seemed inclined to change his mind, after all, and stay.\r\nBut the boys were eager in urging him off. So the good captain allowed\r\nhimself to be persuaded against his better reason, and he and Wade got\r\non board the Antelope, and the lines were cast off.\r\n\r\nThe sails of the schooner were hoisted, and the breeze filled them,\r\nmoving the schooner slowly away.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet stood at the stern of the Antelope, holding the tiller.\r\nHis face was turned towards the boys, who stood in a group on the\r\nquarter-deck of the Petrel. He seemed melancholy and miserable.\r\n\r\n“Boys,” said he, in a tremulous voice, “dear boys, take care of\r\nyourselves.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” cried Bart, cheerily.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope moved farther off.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet stood looking at the ship, and his face had an expression\r\nof despair. At times he called out to them; but the Antelope moved\r\nfarther and farther off every minute, and at length his voice could no\r\nlonger be heard.\r\n\r\nIt was evening when the Antelope left. In about an hour she was lost to\r\nview.\r\n\r\nThe boys were alone on the ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n_Corbet at the Helm.--Visions by Night.--The Vis-ion of sudden Wealth.--\r\nOver the Waters.--The Ocean Isles.--A startling and unwelcome\r\nSight.--Landing of Corbet.--Corbet among the Moun-seers.--Unpleasant\r\nIntelligence.--An unwelcome Visitor.--A sharp Inquisition.--Corbet in\r\na Corner.--Answers of Guile and Simplicity.--Perplexity of Cross\r\nexaminer._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHUS the Antelope passed away from the eyes of the boys, and vanished\r\ninto the shades of night. The breeze was light, and Corbet stood at the\r\nhelm, shaping his course for the Magdalen Islands. The first feeling\r\nof uneasiness which he had experienced on leaving ‘the boys in so very\r\npeculiar, perhaps dangerous, a situation, had passed away with the\r\nboys themselves, and his thoughts now turned on other things. He was\r\nvirtually alone. Wade indeed, was on board, but the captain had sent\r\nhim below to sleep, so that he might be able to relieve him and take his\r\nturn at midnight.\r\n\r\nThus alone at the helm, Captain Corbet looked out over the silent sea,\r\nand up into the starry sky, and lost himself in peaceful meditations.\r\nBut his thoughts were not concerned with sea or sky. Other and dearer\r\nsubjects gave them occupation. It was his “babby” that occupied his\r\nmind; that babby for whose sake he had deserted the boys, and left them\r\nalone in mid ocean. He was going to make a fortune for his son. He was\r\ngoing to take measures for securing the wrecked ship, so as to bring her\r\ninto some port, sell her, and divide the proceeds.\r\n\r\nNight, and solitude, and silence are ever the best promoters of\r\nmeditation, and Captain Corbet’s fancy was stimulated and quickened by\r\nhis present surroundings. In thought he went all over the Petrel.\r\nHe examined her hull; he considered her cargo; he made light of her\r\ninjuries--He concluded that a very small sum might make her once more\r\nseaworthy, and he thought that fifteen thousand pounds might be easily\r\nobtained for her. Then as to her cargo; that he knew must be perfectly\r\nfree from injury. He tried to estimate the number of tons; then he\r\nmultiplied these by the price per ton, so as to get at the value of the\r\nentire cargo. Then he added this to the value of the ship, and allowed\r\nhis mind to play freely around the aggregate. It was a sum of dazzling\r\nproportions--a sum far greater than he had been able to make after the\r\nhard toil and persevering efforts of many laborious years! And all this\r\nhe was now about to achieve by one stroke. It was to be the work of a\r\nfew days. It was to be for the good of the “babby.”\r\n\r\nHere another theme attracted the thoughts of the good captain,--the\r\nfondest of all themes,--his infant son. That son would now have\r\nsomething that would approximate to wealth. All his future would take\r\ntone and flavor from this adventure. The father’s best feelings were\r\nroused, and in fancy he traced the future of his beloved infant. He saw\r\nhim pass from long clothes into short clothes, from frocks into jackets,\r\nand from jackets into coats. He followed him in thought from his\r\nmother’s arms to his own legs; from his home to the school; from the\r\nschool to the college. He watched him consume the midnight oil for\r\nyears, until he at length reached the brilliant end of his educational\r\ngoal. Then he portrayed before his mind the form of his son in the\r\nfuture,--now at the bar pleading, or on the bench judging; now at the\r\nbedside of the sick; now in the pulpit preaching. He listened to the\r\nsermon of the imaginary preacher, and found himself moved to tears.\r\n\r\n“Dear, dear!” he murmured to himself; “I’d no idee the little feller’d\r\nbe so eliquint. It doos beat all, railly.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet was really like one who had taken intoxicating liquor, or\r\nopium; and, in fact, he was intoxicated, but the stimulus was no\r\ndrink or drug; it was merely his fancy, which had become heated by the\r\nextravagant dream of sudden wealth. Gold produces its own fevers and\r\ndeliriums; and the good captain had been seized by one of these. Yet,\r\nafter all, let it be remembered that his avarice was not for himself,\r\nbut for his child. And as the lone navigator stood at his post under the\r\nmidnight sky, in solitude and darkness, heaping up those bright fancies,\r\nout of which he was rearing so stupendous a castle in the air, he was\r\nbuilding, all the while, not for himself, but for another.\r\n\r\nHad he left the boys under any other circumstances,--that is, supposing\r\nthat he had been capable of so leaving them,--there is no doubt that he\r\nwould have been a prey to the most harassing anxiety on their account,\r\nand would have passed a wakeful night, full of mental distress. But now\r\nthese new thoughts so occupied him that there was no place for anxiety,\r\nand he went on towards the accomplishment of his purpose as resolutely\r\nas though he had left them all in the safest and pleasantest place in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nYet the situation in which they were left was one which might have\r\ncreated anxiety in the breast of even a more unfeeling man than Captain\r\nCorbet--on board a wrecked ship, that lay there in mid sea, with no\r\nmeans of saving themselves in the event of disaster. It was calm now,\r\nbut how long would the calm continue? This breeze, that was wafting\r\nhim along so gently and pleasantly, might stiffen, and strengthen, and\r\nintensify itself into a gale; and how would the gale act upon a ship\r\nthat was virtually under water? Where could the boys betake themselves\r\nfor refuge? How could they avoid the sweep of the surges that a rising\r\nstorm would pour over her decks? Where could they find security from the\r\ndownfall of the masts, which, in the writhing and twisting ship, must\r\ninevitably fall. A storm might change their foothold into a waste of\r\nboiling foam, and make the masts above as dangerous as the sea below.\r\nEven a moderate wind and a very ordinary rising of the sea might make\r\ntheir situation one of peril. Of this the boys, in their inexperience,\r\nhad taken no thought; but this was the very thing that Captain Corbet\r\nought to have thought of, and this was the thing that he was destined\r\nto think of afterwards with anguish of soul. But, for the present, not\r\na thought of this sort came to him. His mind was altogether given up to\r\nthe sway of those exciting and alluring fancies which beckoned him away\r\nto imaginary wealth.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet had arranged to call Wade at midnight; but so excited was\r\nhe by his dreams and speculations that he took no note of time, and was\r\nat length startled by the coming of the dawn. Then he hurried away, sent\r\nWade to the helm, and flung himself into his berth.\r\n\r\nAfter a long and profound sleep, which was the natural consequence of\r\nthe excitement of the previous night, he awaked. To his surprise he\r\nfound that it was about eleven o’clock.\r\n\r\nHe cast a hasty look around.\r\n\r\nHis first feeling was one of satisfaction. There, immediately in front\r\nof him, were the Magdalen Islands. His course had been sufficiently\r\naccurate to bring him to his destination. He was near enough now to cast\r\nanchor, and Wade was already moving forward with that intent.\r\n\r\nBut in that first look that he had given he noticed another thing,\r\nfor which he was not prepared, and which detracted somewhat from the\r\nsatisfaction that had been caused by the sight of the islands.\r\n\r\nHe saw a schooner at anchor.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful outline, the slender, tapering masts, the white spars, and\r\nthe immaculate neatness that characterized this schooner, all told him\r\nplainly what she was, and he needed no closer inspection to feel sure\r\nthat it was the Fawn.\r\n\r\nNow, the sight of the Fawn disturbed the mind of the venerable captain.\r\n\r\nHe dreaded a meeting with her skipper, Captain Tobias Ferguson.\r\n\r\nThe Petrel was a prize for those who might be her salvors. To that\r\nfortunate situation he did not wish to admit any others. He wished\r\nmerely to procure sails, and then navigate her somehow with the\r\nhelp that he already had. He knew well, and he dreaded, the keen\r\ninquisitiveness and the active, restless energy of Captain Tobias\r\nFerguson.\r\n\r\nHe did not want to meet with him at all. In fact, the very last\r\nperson in all the world that he would have chosen to meet with at this\r\nparticular time was this very man.\r\n\r\nSo great was his dread of a meeting, which might ruin all his plans,\r\nthat his first impulse was to fly. He cast a hasty look all around. Upon\r\nthe beach he saw the boat of the Fawn. Evidently the skipper was ashore.\r\nUpon this discovery he at once acted, and determined to move farther\r\naway. Hastily checking Wade, who was in the act of dropping the anchor,\r\nCaptain Corbet wore round, and continued on his former course for a mile\r\nor so. Then, rounding the extremity of the island, he kept on his way\r\nalong the shore, anxiously considering what was best to be done.\r\n\r\nThere were other islands in the group, but this was the one which he\r\nwished to visit, for here only could he hope to find anything like\r\nsails. He had come here for this purpose, and to go away without\r\naccomplishing it was not to be thought of. It now seemed to him that\r\nthe best thing for him to do, under the circumstances, would be to land\r\nhere, and pursue his investigations in a quiet way about the island,\r\nmanaging so as to avoid all contact with Captain Ferguson. He therefore\r\ndropped anchor here, and, taking Wade with him, he went ashore.\r\n\r\nOnce on shore, he went about his search with the utmost diligence, going\r\nfrom house to house, and making inquiries about sails. But from the\r\nfirst his task was a roost discouraging one. Every one assured him that\r\nthere were no spare sails on the island; all the schooners were away,\r\nand whatever stock any one had he generally kept in his schooner, and\r\ntook it with him. This was the information that he got from every one to\r\nwhom he applied.\r\n\r\nFor hour after hour Captain Corbet kept up his fruitless search, dodging\r\nabout cautiously, so as to avoid being seen by Captain Ferguson, in case\r\nhe might be ashore, and keeping a wary lookout. At length he had visited\r\nevery house on the island of any consequence. The only thing that they\r\ncould suggest was for him to go to Miramichi, where he would be likely\r\nto obtain what he wanted.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet, in deep dejection, now retraced his steps to the boat.\r\nHe thought for a time of applying to Ferguson. But a moment’s reflection\r\nmade him give up that idea. He knew that Ferguson would be full of\r\ncuriosity; that he would ask him all about the boys; and he feared that\r\nif he got the slightest hint of the facts of the case, he might start\r\noff instantly for the wreck, and thereby forestall him. It does not\r\nfollow that Ferguson would really have done this; but this was Captain\r\nCorbet’s belief, and it influenced him, of course, precisely as if the\r\nbelief had been well founded.\r\n\r\nHaving thus dismissed the idea of appealing to Ferguson, it remained for\r\nhim to decide what next to do. He did not think of going back. Better to\r\ntake Ferguson into his confidence at once. He still clung to his first\r\nhope and his first plan, and, since Miramichi was the nearest place\r\nwhere he could rely upon finding sails, he began to think about going\r\nthere. True, this would take up two or three days more, and the boys\r\nwould be left to themselves all that time; but, as he had already\r\naccustomed himself to think of them in their present position as quite\r\nsafe, he was able to entertain the thought of leaving them this way\r\nstill, longer. He had committed himself too deeply to his plan, he had\r\ngone too far towards its execution, and he had built too largely upon\r\nits successful accomplishment, to be willing to give it up just yet.\r\n\r\nAnd so by the time he reached the boat he had about made up his mind to\r\nstart off for Miramichi at once. With this resolve he went back to the\r\nschooner.\r\n\r\nThe moment that he stepped on deck he was astonished at detecting in\r\nthe atmosphere the smell of cigar smoke; and while he was yet standing,\r\nwith open mouth and expanded nostrils, inhaling the unwelcome odor, he\r\nwas still more unpleasantly surprised at seeing a figure emerge from\r\nthe cabin, in whom at one glance he recognized the well-known and\r\nparticularly dreaded lineaments of Captain Tobias Ferguson.\r\n\r\nHis unwelcome visitor held out his hand, and wrung that of Captain\r\nCorbet with affectionate cordiality.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t expect to see you back again in these parts so soon. You must\r\nhave made a fine run of it, too. How far did you go? Not to the Bay of\r\nIslands--hey? Why, there’s been a reg’lar old-fashioned calm about here,\r\nand this here wind ain’t much to speak of. And how are my young friends,\r\nthe ragamuffins?”\r\n\r\n“Wal--pooty tol’able,” said Captain Corbet, in a faint voice.\r\n\r\n“Hm--glad to hear it. And where was it, did you say, that you went to?”\r\n\r\n“O--a--kine o’--genral sort o’ kerrews, like.”\r\n\r\n“Hm--and so you left them in the Bay of Islands?”\r\n\r\n“Wal--n--n--no--, ’twan’t exactly thereabouts.”\r\n\r\n“O--not Anticosti?”\r\n\r\n“Wal--n--no,” said Captain Corbet, with an increasing sense of\r\ndiscomfort.\r\n\r\n“Ah, St. Pierre?”\r\n\r\n“N--n--n--not exactly.”\r\n\r\n“St. Paul’s, then?”\r\n\r\n“Wal--‘twan’t St. Paul’s, nuther.”\r\n\r\n“O, a kind o’ general cruise, I see; young adventurers, and all that.\r\nBut I’m glad you took my advice, and didn’t go to Anticosti. A bad\r\nplace. And how do they like Newfoundland?”\r\n\r\n“Wal--they--didn’t--quite git to Newfoundland, nuther,” said Captain\r\nCorbet, in a low, faint, hesitating, confused way.\r\n\r\n“No, of course not,” said Ferguson, briskly. “Too far away; I said so.\r\nYou concluded to go to Gaspe, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Wal--n--n--n--no, we didn’t quite get--off--in that thar--de--rection,”\r\n replied Captain Corbet, who was utterly at a loss how to fight off this\r\neager and inquisitive questioner. Had the good captain been capable of\r\ntelling a lie, his task would have been easier; but he was a truthful\r\nman, and in this case he hardly knew what to do.\r\n\r\n“Well, come now,” said Ferguson, “where did you go?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet started at this point blank question, and was perfectly\r\ndumb.\r\n\r\nFerguson looked at him with keen scrutiny, and then said,--\r\n\r\n“You don’t answer. What’s the matter? Has anything happened? Where are\r\nthe boys?”\r\n\r\nAgain the unfortunate Corbet was unable to answer.\r\n\r\n“It’s a plain question enough,” said Ferguson, “and you’ve _got_ to\r\nanswer it somehow--for I’m going down Nova Scotia way, and may see\r\nsome of their parents. So, own up, old man. What have you done with the\r\nboys?”\r\n\r\nAt this moment a happy thought occurred to the bewildered Corbet. It\r\ncame like a ray of light in deep darkness.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said he, “you see, capting--you know--them thar youngsters, you\r\nknow--they--they’ve--got up a kine o’ secret society--you know--they\r\ntold you--themselves--you know--and they’re all together--you know--and\r\nit’s a matter--of importance--to them--and to me--to--to--to--to keep\r\nthe secret, you know. O, I do assure you it’s all right--they’re all\r\nsafe an sound--an enjyin life; good quarters, plenty to eat an drink, an\r\nole Solomon a doin of the cookin--but it’s a great secret, you know--and\r\nso--you see--capting--the fact is--I’d a _leetle_ rayther not let on\r\nwhere they air jest now.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet spoke this in a confused way, and in a mild, deprecatory\r\nmanner. Ferguson listened attentively to his words, and then stood\r\nlooking at him for some time with an air of dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n“Well--old man,” said he, “I do remember some nonsense of theirs about a\r\nsecret society; but you haven’t answered my question; you evade it; and\r\nwhat their secret society has to do with their present situation I don’t\r\nquite begin to make out. The fact is, I don’t consider you a fit\r\nguardian for such boys as they are, and my opinion all along has been\r\nthat they’ll all get into mischief. I’m afraid that they’re in some fix\r\nat this particular moment, and that you have left them at the very time\r\nthat you ought to be standin by them. If you don’t choose to tell me, I\r\ncan’t make you--only I warn you, if the boys air in a fix it’s best to\r\nlet me know, for I can go and help them sooner and better than you can.”\r\n\r\n“O, but railly, now--now--railly, capting,” said Corbet, with great\r\nearnestness, “I do assure you, honest and honor bright, there ain’t no\r\ndifficulty about the boys. They’re all rail happy--tip-top, an no\r\nmistake; as lively as crickets; lots to eat an drink, comfortable beds,\r\ngood cookery--all in good spirits and a enjyin of themselves in a way\r\nthat would do your heart good to see.”\r\n\r\n“Well--but where are they?” persisted Ferguson.\r\n\r\n“Wal--now--railly--you know,” said Captain Corbet, “it’s a kine o’\r\nsecret--an I’d very much rather not tell--that is--not _jest_ now; now\r\nrailly--don’t ask me.”\r\n\r\nFerguson looked at him for a few moments with the same scrutinizing look\r\nthat he had already turned upon him.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going now?” he asked at length; “back to the boys?”\r\n\r\n“Wal--not _jest_ yet,” answered Corbet, after a pause. “The fact is, I\r\nwas thinkin a little of takin a turn over Miramichi way--on business. I\r\nwon’t belong, and they’ll be all right till I get back from Miramichi.”\r\n\r\n“O, the boys’ll have to wait for you, in the place where they now are,\r\ntill you get back from Miramichi--so that’s it.”\r\n\r\nFerguson spoke these words slowly and deliberately, with his eyes fixed\r\non Captain Corbet. The latter looked somewhat uncomfortable, and for a\r\nwhile said nothing; but at length he murmured,--\r\n\r\n“Wal--I s’pose--that’s--about--it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n_The Baffled Inquisitor.--Corbet’s Flight by Night.--Dead\r\nBeckoning.--His Purpose accomplished.--Once more an unwelcome\r\nVisitor.--The warning Words.--Corbet confident.--“Right straight\r\nback”--The stormy Water.--The gloomy Night and the gloomier Day.--Where\r\nis the Petrel?--Despair of Corbet._\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING that Captain Corbet was obstinate in his refusal to tell him\r\nabout the boys, Ferguson at length desisted from his inquiries, and\r\ndeparted from the Antelope, much to the relief of the commander of that\r\nvessel. But, though he had left the Antelope, he had by no means given\r\nup his investigations into the cause of her present voyage. He at once\r\nrowed to the shore, with the intention of finding out from the people\r\nthere what had been Corbet’s business among them.\r\n\r\nThis he had no difficulty whatever in finding out. Corbet had come there\r\nwith only one purpose, and this he had made known to every one with whom\r\nhe came in contact, as best he could.\r\n\r\nHe had picked up a man who spoke English, and this man had accompanied\r\nhim in his rounds as interpreter. This very man fell into Ferguson’s\r\nway, and from him Ferguson was able to learn that Captain Corbet’s\r\nsole aim in visiting the Magdalen Islands was to obtain some sails. He\r\nlearned that the sails, could not be obtained, and also that they had\r\nrecommended him to go to Miramichi for them. By this he understood the\r\nreason why Captain Corbet was going to that place.\r\n\r\nNow, Ferguson had taken a great fancy to the boys; but the opinion which\r\nhe had formed of Captain Corbet and the Antelope was of a very different\r\nkind. That opinion he had been at no pains to conceal. He had, in fact,\r\nexpressed it freely and frequently. He had called Captain Corbet an\r\n“old woman,” and the Antelope “a tub.” This opinion he still cherished.\r\nMoreover, he had prophesied solemnly that the boys were more likely than\r\nnot to land at the bottom of the sea before their voyage was over, and\r\nthis prophecy he still believed in. In fact, the strong regard that he\r\nhad conceived for these boys made him feel uneasy about them, and he did\r\nnot like to think of them sailing about these seas with such a vessel\r\nand such a commander. The sudden appearance of the Antelope had excited\r\nhis apprehensions. He had seen her come in while he was ashore. He had\r\nnoticed her manoeuvres. He had watched her as she rounded to and then\r\nstood off again. He had then gone in his boat to watch her, and had seen\r\nher anchor. He had seen Captain Corbet go ashore with Wade. He had\r\nthen rowed to her, boarded her, and examined her. The result of this\r\nexamination was anything but satisfactory. He could not see any signs\r\nof the boys. All their luggage was gone. What had become of them was\r\nhis first thought, and he had waited for the return of Captain Corbet\r\nin deep uneasiness.’ That uneasiness had only been increased when the\r\ncaptain returned and answered his questions in so evasive a manner.\r\n\r\nHe had not been prepared for this; the evasive answers of Captain Corbet\r\nirritated him, and awakened his suspicions. The secrecy which he threw\r\naround the movements of the boys was in the highest degree annoying. He\r\nhad come hoping to find them on board. Their absence had filled him\r\nwith uneasiness. In this state of uneasiness he had waited on board\r\nfor hours, fidgeting and fuming; and the end of it all was, that when\r\nCaptain Corbet did appear, he refused to answer the simplest questions.\r\n\r\nThere were several things that troubled and perplexed him to an unusual\r\nand a most unpleasant degree.\r\n\r\nFirst. What had become of the boys? Captain Corbet would not say. He had\r\nasked about every place in which it was possible that they could be, and\r\nhad been told, most positively, that they were not there. Anticosti, Bay\r\nof Islands, Newfoundland, St. Pierre, St. Paul’s, Gaspe, all the coasts\r\nsurrounding the gulf he had asked after, and he had been told that they\r\nwere in none of them. Where, then, could they be? Such secrecy puzzled\r\nand irritated him. Captain Corbet’s story about the secret society did\r\nnot deceive him for one instant. He saw through it all. He saw that\r\nCaptain Corbet, though incapable of telling a falsehood, was yet willing\r\nto mislead, or to put him on a false track; but, for his part, he was\r\nnot the man who could be easily misled or baffled.\r\n\r\nThen came the discovery which he had made of the purpose which Captain\r\nCorbet had in visiting the Magdalen Islands. He had come for sails.\r\nSails! What did he want of sails? What absurd project had he formed? And\r\nwhat had his search for sails to do with the absence of the boys? Yet,\r\nso great was Captain Corbet’s desire to obtain sails, that he was going\r\nto Miramichi for that very purpose.\r\n\r\nThen, again, Ferguson could not forget the way in which Captain Corbet\r\nhad come to the Magdalen Islands. He had come--he had appeared for a\r\nmoment, as if about to anchor, but then had turned away, and sailed\r\nelsewhere. The whole manoeuvre had looked exactly like a wish to avoid\r\nthe Fawn, and it might have been successful, had he not pursued so\r\nclosely. Captain Corbet’s appearance also, when he first came on the\r\ndeck of the Antelope, and found himself confronted by his visitor, his\r\nstart, his look of surprise, his confusion, his hesitation,--all these\r\nthings made him seem the more open to suspicion.\r\n\r\nSuspicion!\r\n\r\nAnd of what?\r\n\r\nNow, Ferguson did not for a moment believe Captain Corbet capable of\r\nwrong. In fact, he looked upon him as an imbecile. Yet, even from that\r\npoint of view, his uneasiness about the boys was none the less. These\r\nboys, under the care of an imbecile, seemed to him to be in as great\r\nperil as though their guardian had been a criminal. Where were they now?\r\nHad the folly or the imbecility of their captain drawn them into some\r\nposition of danger? They were innocent and inexperienced; he was an\r\nimbecile; all were alike unprepared to encounter the dangers that might\r\nbefall them; and from all these causes combined, the boys might now be\r\nin a position of very serious danger, while this incapable guardian was\r\nidly roaming the seas.\r\n\r\nThe more he thought of all these things, the more uneasy he felt; until,\r\nat length, his fears about the safety of the boys, who had so suddenly\r\nawakened his interest, grew so strong, that he determined to keep\r\nCaptain Corbet in sight. Believing that they were in some situation of\r\npossible danger, into which they had been drawn by their own ignorance\r\nand Captain Corbet’s imbecility, and in which they were now left,\r\nFerguson felt an intolerable anxiety, and so at length came to the\r\nconclusion to follow the Antelope, until some light should be thrown\r\nupon this mystery.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Captain Corbet, having got rid of his troublesome visitor,\r\nwaited patiently until the boat had rounded the projecting promontory\r\nof the island, and then proceeded to continue his voyage. He had already\r\nmade up his mind to go to Mirami-chi, and this visit of Ferguson,\r\ntogether with his sharp inquiries, far from changing his purpose,\r\nhad only served to intensify it. He only waited until the boat which\r\ncontained his dreaded visitor was out of sight, in order to hurry his\r\ndeparture. Accordingly the anchor was weighed in the utmost haste, the\r\nsails hoisted, and soon the Antelope set forth on a fresh cruise. The\r\nwind was still light, yet sufficient for his purpose; and he directed\r\nhis course around the island, so as to avoid, as far as possible, being\r\nseen by Ferguson. His knowledge of these waters was not very minute, yet\r\nit was sufficient to give him a general idea of his destination, and he\r\nsteered the Antelope accordingly.\r\n\r\nEvening came, and the Antelope continued on her course. All night long\r\nshe traversed the waters, and on the following day approached the New\r\nBrunswick coast. Here Captain Corbet recognized the entrance to the Bay\r\nde Chaleur, and, turning southward, he sailed along the coast towards\r\nthe Miramichi River. As he went on, he noticed a sail some miles away;\r\nbut to this he paid no attention. It was a common enough thing in these\r\nwaters, and there was no reason why he should notice it particularly.\r\nThe sail remained in sight all that day; and at length, as he entered\r\nthe Miramichi River and sailed up it, the fact that this stranger was\r\nfollowing did not excite any attention on his part.\r\n\r\nThree large towns lie on the Miramichi River,--Chatham, Douglastown,\r\nand Newcastle. Of these, two are a few miles from the mouth, on opposite\r\nsides of the stream--Chatham and Douglastown; and the three towns\r\nform together the centre of a great trade in ship-building, and in the\r\nexportation of deals and timber. Here may be found all that appertains\r\nto the outfit of a ship, and here Captain Corbet expected to procure\r\nwhat he wanted.\r\n\r\nIt was evening when the Antelope dropped anchor in the river opposite\r\nChatham. It was then too late to do anything; so Captain Corbet had\r\nto postpone his business until the following day. Pleased with his\r\nprosperous voyage, and pleased still more with the easy way in which he\r\nhad got rid of Ferguson, full of hope also in the successful completion\r\nof his business, he retired to bed that night, and slept placidly and\r\nprofoundly. The wind that night arose, and blew hard; but the venerable\r\ncaptain, sunk in slumber, and surrounded by the river shores, heard\r\nnothing of the noise of the storm. Had he been out at sea, he would\r\ndoubtless have thought of the boys in the distant ship; but here in the\r\nplacid river there was nothing to mar his repose.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Captain Corbet went ashore at Chatham, and\r\nbegan a search after the sails. The search took up some time, but at\r\nlength he succeeded in finding what he wanted. He found some sails and\r\nrigging that had been taken from a condemned ship, and were held for\r\nsale. They had not been considered good enough for a ship’s outfit, and\r\nhad not only been torn and rent by storms, but also, from having been\r\nkept in a damp warehouse, they were somewhat mildewed. Still they served\r\nCaptain Corbet’s purpose as well as brand new ones could have done, and,\r\nin fact, even better, for their damaged condition enabled him to obtain\r\nthem at a price which was commensurate with his means. It took some time\r\nto get these all stowed away properly in the Antelope; but at length the\r\nwork was satisfactorily accomplished, and Captain Corbet emerged from\r\nthe hold, and ascended upon deck, with a smile of serene satisfaction,\r\nand the peaceful consciousness that this had been a well-spent, day.\r\n\r\nThus, with this smile of serenity and this tranquil breast did our\r\ngood Captain Corbet emerge from the hold and ascend to the deck of the\r\nAntelope. Scarcely, however, had he set foot thereon, scarcely had he\r\ntaken one look around, than the smile on his face faded away utterly,\r\nand the tranquillity of his soul was abruptly ended.\r\n\r\nFor there, full before him, seated calmly on the rail, with a piece of\r\nsoft pine stick in one hand, and a keen jackknife in the other, with\r\na cigar in his mouth, and a pleasant glance in his eye,--there sat the\r\ndreaded Ferguson, the very man whom Captain Corbet most feared to see,\r\nand whom he believed to be far away at the Magdalen Islands.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet stood rooted to the spot. His jaw dropped. He was\r\nparalyzed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0149]\r\n\r\n“You made a nice run,” said Ferguson. “A snug place this.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet did not answer. He was too confused.\r\n\r\n“I see you got your sails. I s’pose you didn’t have any trouble.”\r\n\r\nThese words increased the dismay of Captain Corbet. He thought that this\r\nwould be a profound secret. Ferguson now showed that he knew it. He must\r\nhave found out about this at the Magdalen Islands. Whether he knew any\r\nmore or not, was a troublesome problem. Captain Corbet did not see how\r\nhe could possibly know any more, and yet Ferguson had such a knowing\r\nlook, that he would not have been surprised at learning that he knew\r\nall.\r\n\r\n“I see you’ve got your sails,” said Ferguson, as Captain Corbet did not\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the other, in a melancholy tone, and with a resigned look.\r\n\r\n“It’s pretty difficult to get hold of things of that sort in these\r\nparts, and you were lucky enough to get them so easy. They’ll do for\r\nyour purpose, I s’pose.”\r\n\r\n“O, yes,” said Captain Corbet, “they’ll do--well enough--considerin;\r\njust as well as if they was new.”\r\n\r\n“I s’pose you’re going right back from this?”\r\n\r\n“Right back?” repeated Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\n“Yes; you don’t intend to go dawdling about any longer--do you?”\r\n\r\n“O, no.”\r\n\r\n“And you’re going right straight back?”\r\n\r\n“O, yes.”\r\n\r\n“And when I say right straight back,” continued Ferguson, “I mean, of\r\ncourse, right straight back to the boys. It’s only the boys I consider.\r\nI feel anxious about them. I consider myself in some sort, just now, as\r\nresponsible for their rescue, or, at any rate, for their safety; and,\r\nold man, let me warn you solemnly to be careful what you’re about. Don’t\r\nyou go flitting about any longer in this style. Go you right straight\r\nback to where those boys are; if you don’t, there’ll be trouble.”\r\n\r\nThe tone of Ferguson was earnest and anxious. Captain Corbet looked\r\ndistressed.\r\n\r\n“O, railly, now,” he said: “see here now; railly I do assure you, sir,\r\nthe boys are all right, and all happy--plenty to eat, good quarters, and\r\nold Solomon to cook for them and make their beds. Why, you don’t suppose\r\nI’m made of iron, or that I’d have the heart to leave them in any place\r\nexcept where they would be safe?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe you’d leave them in any place that you might think\r\ndangerous, of course; but the trouble is you might leave them somewhere,\r\nnot knowing it to be dangerous, while all the time it would be very\r\ndangerous indeed. Have you sailed much about these waters?”\r\n\r\n“Wal--n--no, not to say much.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I have; and let me tell you, it won’t do to trust to your\r\njudgment where such precious things are concerned as the lives of those\r\nboys. I felt afraid, when I first saw the Antelope without the boys,\r\nthat they had fallen into some difficulty through your ignorance or\r\ncarelessness, and the moment I spoke to you about it, I felt convinced\r\nof it. It has worried me ever since. I took for granted that you were\r\ngoing back from the Magdalen Islands, and had no idea that you would\r\nventure so far away from them as this. When I learned your object, and\r\nsaw where you were heading, I followed you on purpose to say what I now\r\nsay; and that is, Go back, go back, old man, go back to the boys. I feel\r\nsure that they are in danger.”\r\n\r\n“But ain’t I going to go back?” cried Captain Corbet, with as much\r\nvexation in his tone as could be showed by one of so amiable a nature.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, I am, then,--thar.”\r\n\r\n“Now?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; right away.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” said Ferguson, standing up and getting over the side\r\nof the Antelope into his own boat; “and one word more: don’t you delay.\r\nPile on all the sail this old tub’ll carry, and get back to those boys\r\nas soon as you can.”\r\n\r\n“O, you needn’t be a mite afeard,” said Captain Corbet, in a confident\r\ntone. “Them thar boys are jest as safe as you and me. They’re not only\r\nsafe, but comfortable; yes, comfortable, and jolly, and lively, and\r\nhappy, and safe, and sound. All right.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well; I only hope it may turn out so,” said Ferguson; and with\r\nthese words he rowed away.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet had spoken these last words in a very confident tone;\r\nbut, in spite of this, he was by no means so confident as he seemed. In\r\nspite of himself, the warning words of Ferguson had sunk deep into his\r\nsoul, and roused very deep anxiety. Now, too, that the great purpose of\r\nhis voyage had been achieved, and the sails were actually lying stowed\r\naway in the hold, he had leisure to think of those boys, and of the\r\nsituation in which he had left them. He had left them far longer than he\r\nhad intended. He had been gone now three days. It might take two days to\r\nget back, and in case of a calm, it might take far longer. The thought\r\nof this filled him with uneasiness.\r\n\r\nFerguson himself, had he been on board, would have commended the\r\nactivity with which captain and mate now proceeded to hoist anchor and\r\nsail. In a very short time the Antelope was under way.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet’s uneasiness grew greater. The warnings of Ferguson\r\nstarted up in his mind, and joined themselves to his recollections of\r\nthe ship. He remembered how unwilling he had been to leave them, and\r\nhow they had overpersuaded him. He began to lament that he had ever gone\r\naway. The vision of sudden wealth had lost all its charm, and no longer\r\ndazzled his mind.\r\n\r\nAt length he passed out of the river into the gulf. Ever since he had\r\nstarted, the wind had been blowing more and more, and at length, on\r\nreaching the open sea, it was quite a gale. All around the waves tossed\r\nup their white caps, and the clouds scudded across the sky. This only\r\nincreased the anxiety of the captain, and as he looked out upon the\r\nwaste of waters, he trembled for the safety of those who were so\r\nhelpless in that half-sunken ship. How would they endure this? For this\r\nhe had not been prepared. He could not forgive himself.\r\n\r\nAll that night he sailed on, full of grief and terror. The wind\r\nincreased; the sea rose higher.\r\n\r\nThe next day came, and wind and sea were yet high. The progress of the\r\nAntelope was very good, and towards evening Captain Corbet reckoned that\r\nhe must be approaching the place where the Petrel lay.\r\n\r\nBut the shades of night came down, and nothing was visible. For a few\r\nhours Captain Corbet sailed on, and at length lay to. This must be the\r\nplace, according to his calculations; and on the following morning he\r\nhoped to see the tall masts of the wrecked ship.\r\n\r\nThe next morning came.\r\n\r\nAll that night Captain Corbet had paced the deck in sleepless misery.\r\nWith the first beam of dawn his eyes sought the horizon, and as the day\r\ngrew brighter, he still sought eagerly in all directions.\r\n\r\nIn vain.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose. It was broad day.\r\n\r\nBut upon the face of the waters there was not a sign of the Petrel.\r\n\r\nOnly one sail was visible, and that was a schooner far away to the west.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet stood terror-struck, and looked all around with a face of\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n_The water-logged Ship.--Alone upon the Waters.--Jolly under\r\ncreditable Circumstances.--Old Solomon’s queer Fancies.--He dreads his\r\nPersecutor.--He prefers the Life of Crusoe.--Follow my Leader.--Swimming\r\nin deep Waters.--An important Meeting.--Debates.--Parties\r\nformed.--Molassesites and Sugarites.--Desperate Struggle of Phil, and\r\nmelancholy Result._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE night after Captain Corbet left was spent by the boys without any\r\nincident of an unusual character. At first when they felt them-sleves\r\nthus cut off from all chance of leaving the vessel, there came over\r\nevery one a singular sense of loneliness, together with an exhilarating\r\nfeeling of independence. Their situation seemed to them like that of\r\nshipwrecked mariners on a desert island, and they all found the part\r\nof Robinson Crusoe a very pleasant one, under the circumstances. Their\r\nlodgings were excellent, their provisions varied and abundant; they had\r\na cook who was master of his art; and they looked for the return of the\r\nAntelope within twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet had laid stress upon this; and the only conditions upon\r\nwhich he consented to tear himself away from them had been, that he\r\nwould not go farther than the Magdalen Islands. For he had fully counted\r\non obtaining there what he needed, and had not made any calculations\r\nwith reference to a failure.\r\n\r\nThat first evening, then, the boys were in high spirits, and\r\ninterchanged many jocular remarks about their situation. Solomon\r\nexpressed more than usual gratification, and seemed to have a serene\r\nself-satisfaction, which was extraordinary in him. As the shades of\r\nnight descended he began to illuminate the cabin. He had found some oil,\r\nand had filled the lamp which hung immediately under the skylight. It\r\nwas a large one, with four argand burners, and threw a brilliant lustre\r\nover the scene. Beneath this bright glow the boys sat at the evening\r\nrepast, spread by the hands of Solomon, where they found the usual\r\nvariety of dishes, and also not a few of quite a novel and original\r\ncharacter. To play the part of Robinson Crusoe under such circumstances\r\nas these was not at all unpleasant.\r\n\r\nAmong all the boys, then, there prevailed a spirit of joyousness, and\r\nold Solomon’s mood was certainly not out of accord with that of his\r\nyoung companions. For Bart found him alone in his solitary galley,\r\nrubbing his thighs in front of a roasting fire, and chuckling audibly to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“Tell ye what, Massa Bart,” was his exclamation as he looked up at his\r\nsmiling visitor, “dis yer am high ole times, an no mistake; dis yer ole\r\nnigger habn’t felt so happy an habn’t had sich a strornary feelin of\r\nskewrity, ebber since he was your age. Let dat dar Ant’lope keep way’s\r\nlong ebber she kin. I don want to see her again. I want to take up\r\nmy bode in dis yer galley, and bid farewell to ebery feah, an wipe my\r\nweepin eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s a curious fancy too,” said Bart, in some surprise. “You\r\ndon’t mean to say that you’d like to live here.”\r\n\r\n“Would so; dat dar’s _jest_ wat I mean, an it’s wat’d zactly suit dis\r\nyer ole man, an no mistake now--would so.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bart, sympathetically, “it’s not a bad place just now, as\r\nlong as the weather’s fine, though how it might be in case of a blow, I\r\nconfess I have my suspicions.”\r\n\r\n“O, you nebber mind de blow. Dar’s blows dat are a heap wuss dan de\r\nwind. How would you like blows on yer head, an backbone, an ribs, from\r\na broomstick, or a shobbel, or a stick ob cord-wood, or a red-hot iron\r\npoker? Dem’s blows as is blows, mind I tell you! Tell you what, when you\r\ncome to git blows, like dat ar, you’ll begin to hab a realizin sense ob\r\nwhat blows is possible for to be.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Solomon, how very feelingly you speak!”\r\n\r\n“Feelinly! Ony wait till you’ve felt ober your head an shoulders what\r\nshe’s giben me.”\r\n\r\n“She? Who?”\r\n\r\nSolomon gave a groan.\r\n\r\n“You know her. You--saw her at Loch--Lomond.”\r\n\r\n“What, your wife! O, I understand;” and a light began to dawn upon Bart.\r\n\r\nSolomon shuddered. The remembrance was too much for him.\r\n\r\n“Dis yer’s de fust time I’ve felt real safe for ebber so long; and here\r\nI am real safe. She can’t git at me here no how. She can’t imagine where\r\nI am no how.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! nonsense, Solomon! Haven’t you been safe enough ever since you\r\nleft St. John?”\r\n\r\n“No, sah! Safe! Why, dar’s not a moment ob de day dat I don’t fancy\r\ndat ar woman’s arter me--on my back. I knows it. Tell you what, she’s\r\na comin to fetch me. I knows it. I feel it in my bones, and dat ar’s a\r\nfeelin dat’s wuss dan de rheumatics. ’Tis so!”\r\n\r\n“But what a rdiculous fancy!” said Bart. “Do you really mean to say that\r\nyou believe she will come after you?”\r\n\r\n“Do so. No doubt bout dat ar, Mas’r Bart. She’s a comin jest as shuah’s\r\nyou’re born. An I habn’t felt real safe’ till now. Here I’m all right.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose she does come?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, s’pposin.”\r\n\r\n“What can she do to you?”\r\n\r\n“Do! Lots ob tings. She can come and lib whar I lib, an hamma away all\r\nday an all night on my ole head wid broomsticks an pokers.”\r\n\r\n“But what makes you let her?”\r\n\r\n“Let her? Wat can I do bout it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, the law’ll protect you.”\r\n\r\n“Be law sakes, chile! Don’t you know de law can’t ’tect husbands agin\r\nwives? It’ll only ’tect wives agin husbands. My pinion is, dat de\r\nlaw’s clean in fabor ob de women, an de men hain’t got no chance--not a\r\nmite.”\r\n\r\nAt this new view of the law Bart was somewhat nonplussed.\r\n\r\n“O, well,” said he, “I don’t believe she’ll ever trouble you again.\r\nYou’ll go back to the academy, and Dr. Porter’ll take care of you.”\r\n\r\nSolomon shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Tell you what,” said he; “fifty millium Docta Porta’s couldn’t do\r\nanythin agin dat ar woman if she come to fetch me. De ’cadmy ain’t no\r\nplace for me. Don’t think you’ll eber catch me back dar. Ise boun to be\r\na rober; an I’ll sail de sea, so as to prebent her from eber a gittin on\r\nmy track.”\r\n\r\n“O, nonsense!” said Bart. “You’ll come with us, and it’ll be all right.”\r\n\r\nSolomon shook his head, and relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\nAnd now it became time to prepare for bed. Solomon had already arranged\r\nthe state-rooms and made the beds. Thanks to their assiduous care, the\r\nrooms and the bedding were all quite dry and very inviting.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful night. There was a gentle breeze, which made a slight\r\nripple on the water, but there was not enough to raise a sea. There was\r\na slight motion on the ship, as she slowly rose and fell to the long\r\nand gentle undulations; but the motion was scarcely perceptible, and\r\ncertainly did not interfere in the slightest degree with the comfort\r\nof those on board. It was about ten o’clock when they retired for the\r\nnight. They went to the different rooms which had fallen to their\r\nlot. The excitement of the day and of the evening, the long fatigues,\r\ntogether with the exhaustion arising from former privations, all\r\nconspired to make their sleep this night very profound as well as very\r\nrefreshing. Solomon sat till midnight toasting his shins in front of the\r\ngalley fire, and meditating about the strange vicissitudes of life which\r\nhad brought across his path that being whom he so justly feared. But\r\nSolomon’s thoughts gradually became intermingled with the confused\r\nfancies of the land of Nod; and at length awaking with a start, he\r\nrubbed his sleepy eyes, and carried his aged frame somewhere “for’ard.”\r\n None of the party awoke until late on the following day. Then, on\r\nopening their eyes, their nostrils were greeted with savory odors that\r\nwere wafted from the cabin, which served to show them that Solomon, at\r\nleast, had not overslept himself, but that he was up and doing, and that\r\nhe had prepared everything that might be needed to fortify them for the\r\ncares and trials of a new day. For the savory odors that were wafted to\r\ntheir nostrils were multifarious, and among them each boy, before he had\r\nmade up his mind to rise, and while he was still enjoying that luxurious\r\ndoze that follows the awakening from sleep, could have enumerated, had\r\nhe felt inclined, the strong, rich aroma of coffee, the pungent odor\r\nof broiled ham, the gentler steam of distilling tea, the appetizing\r\natmosphere shed forth from hot rolls, together with a confused medley of\r\nothers equally attractive, though less definable. .\r\n\r\nA rush upon deck to breathe the glorious air, and to look upon the scene\r\naround, followed. The view was most enlivening. Far and wide around them\r\nextended the deep blue water, whereon not a sail was visible. Overhead\r\nhung the azure vault of heaven, with not a cloud in all its wide\r\nexpanse. The wind was light, and blew at intervals, nor had it increased\r\nsince the night before. They took their morning bath on deck in the\r\ncool, refreshing salt water, dipped out fresh from the sea. Pat improved\r\non this, for he undressed himself again, and plunged into the sea,\r\nwhere he swam about, and called on the others to follow. His example was\r\ninfectious, and soon the whole party were floundering and gamboling in\r\nthe water, like a shoal of porpoises, beside the ship.\r\n\r\nThe bath was a most refreshing one, and added to the zest with which\r\nthey attacked their breakfast. When, at length, this repast was\r\nfinished, they once more came forth to the deck like giants refreshed,\r\nand began to make plans for passing the time. For their active young\r\nnatures, filled to overflowing with animal spirits, some lively exercise\r\nwas needed. This they found in an exploring tour among the rigging. Bart\r\nwent first, and then the others. Each one tried to venture farther than\r\nthe others. Thus it soon became a game--the well-known one often played\r\nat sea in fine weather called “follow my leader.”\r\n\r\nBart’s training in a seaport town gave him an advantage over the others,\r\neven though some of them were stronger, and others more active than he.\r\nBut he had all through his boyhood been familiar with ships, and had\r\nventured time and again to every part. There was no height so dizzy\r\nbut that he had sought it out and familiarized himself with it. Bart,\r\ntherefore, on the present occasion easily surpassed the others in\r\nfeats of daring, and ventured where none of the others could follow.\r\nSingularly enough, it was Phil who came nearest to him. His light,\r\nlithe, slender, yet sinewy frame made him as nimble as a kitten in the\r\nrigging, and if he had only had Bart’s practice and familiarity, he\r\nwould have decidedly surpassed him. Phil came near enough to Bart to\r\nelicit the admiration and the applause of all. Next to Phil came Pat,\r\nwho was very sinewy and active. Bruce and Arthur were about equal, while\r\nTom, who, though very strong, was somewhat slow and a little awkward,\r\nlingered in the rear. This exciting sport served to occupy several of\r\nthe hours of that summer morning.\r\n\r\nBut at length they had exhausted the utmost resources of even so\r\nfascinating a game as “follow my leader,” and they once more came down\r\nto the common level of every-day life, when they proceeded to debate\r\nthe great question what next to do. A swim about the ship served to\r\nsettle this question until dinner time, after which the important\r\nsubject of dinner remained under discussion long enough to consume a few\r\nmore hours.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner none of them felt very much inclined to take any active\r\nexertion, and they distributed themselves about in various ways. At\r\nlength Bart suggested a regatta, which was at once adopted. Not having\r\nbooks to read, or anything else in particular to attend to, it was not\r\nsurprising that they should take with much excitement to a sport which,\r\nthough perhaps decidedly childish, is yet not without its attractions\r\nto the unoccupied mind. The plan was for each boy to make a boat, put it\r\nover the side, and see which one of the little fleet would beat. These\r\nboats were at first made of paper. But paper was soon found inadequate,\r\nand wood was resorted to. These wooden boats were long and sharp, and\r\nsailed with a speed which excited the warmest interest. At length Bart\r\nproposed a new kind.\r\n\r\nFinding a piece of iron hoop, he broke it into short fragments, and\r\nsticking this underneath a wooden boat, so that it might act as ballast,\r\nkeel, and rudder all in one, he produced a little vessel that would sail\r\nwith the wind abeam, and carry an astonishing amount of canvas. Soon a\r\nfleet of these little vessels was formed, and the regatta went on with\r\nfresh excitement.\r\n\r\nAt length a bright thought struck Phil, which, on being suggested to the\r\nother boys, at once caused all interest in the regatta to be eclipsed by\r\nthe stronger attraction of this new idea.\r\n\r\nIt was nothing less than to make candy.\r\n\r\nAbout this there was a double attraction, for, first, the candy was of\r\nvalue in itself, and secondly, the process of cooking it would, afford\r\nan occupation at once charming and exciting.\r\n\r\nThere was sugar on board, both brown and white, and also molasses. The\r\nchoice among these was the subject of a prolonged debate; but at length,\r\non being put to the vote, it was found that the Molassesites were, in\r\na triumphant majority. Upon this the White Sugarites and the Brown\r\nSugarites waved their objections, and the vote became a unanimous one.\r\n\r\nAnother debate took place upon the appointment of a cook, which was\r\nterminated by a resolve to ballot for one. The result of the balloting\r\nwas the unanimous election of Phil to that important and responsible\r\npost. This was nothing more than was right, and it was a handsome\r\ntribute to Phil for being the originator of the whole scheme. Phil, on\r\nbeing informed of his election, responded in a neat speech, which was\r\ngreeted with loud applause.\r\n\r\nA motion was then made that a deputation be sent to Solomon, requesting\r\nhim to vacate the cook’s galley for a few hours, so that the new purpose\r\nof the assembly might be carried into successful accomplishment.\r\nThis motion was carried, and the deputation was chosen by ballot. The\r\ndeputies were Bart, chairman, Bruce, Arthur, Tom, and Pat.\r\n\r\nUpon the departure of these on their mission, the whole assemblage\r\nconsisted of Phil. Though alone, he contrived to represent the\r\nassemblage with as much dignity as possible, for he laid himself down\r\nflat on the deck, and distributed his arms and legs in all directions,\r\nso that he might occupy as much space as possible.\r\n\r\nThe deputation at length returned, and announced to the assembly that\r\ntheir mission had been successful, and that Solomon had kindly consented\r\nto give up to them the cook’s galley for the required time and purpose.\r\n\r\nUpon this the assembly moved, seconded, and carried unanimously a\r\nresolution that the report of the deputation be adopted.\r\n\r\nUpon this an adjournment took place _sine die_, and the meeting retired\r\nto the scene of labor.\r\n\r\nAbout a gallon of molasses was procured. This was poured into an iron\r\npot, and Phil stationed himself at his post in the galley. The fire\r\nwas supplied with fresh fuel, and soon the liquid began to boil. Phil\r\nstirred away like a good fellow, and the liquid began to froth up. Phil\r\ntried to keep it down, so that it might not boil over. For some time\r\nthere was a desperate struggle between Phil and the molasses. The boys\r\nstood crowding around, watching that struggle with intense interest and\r\nkeen excitement. None of them offered to make a suggestion, for it was\r\nfelt that any offer of advice would be derogatory to the dignity of\r\nPhil’s office.\r\n\r\nSo the struggle went on.\r\n\r\nIt grew fiercer and fiercer every moment.\r\n\r\nNow the molasses rose up in wrath and fury, and seemed about to rush\r\nforth from its iron prison.\r\n\r\nNow Phil, summoning all his energy, dealt a series of destructive blows\r\nat his furious enemy, and laid him low for a time.\r\n\r\nSo went the struggle. Now the molasses gained, now Phil.\r\n\r\nBut all the time the molasses was increasing in fury.\r\n\r\nThe boys stood about. They formed themselves into two parties, one\r\nembracing the cause of the molasses, the other that of Phil. Cheer after\r\ncheer arose as one or the other saw its cause in the ascendant.\r\n\r\nPhil grew weaker and fainter.\r\n\r\nAt length he tried to make a flank attack, and tore open the stove doors\r\nso as to lessen the draught.\r\n\r\nThe movement failed.\r\n\r\nScarce had he torn open the doors than the molasses, rising in its\r\nwrath, rushed forth, streamed over, and poured out in resistless\r\nstrength, driving Phil himself back from the clouds of hot steam that\r\narose.\r\n\r\nPhil fled vanquished from the galley.\r\n\r\nThe molasses had conquered!\r\n\r\nWild cheers arose from the Molassesites.\r\n\r\nAt length, when the smoke and steam had subsided, Phil ventured back.\r\nThere was a boiling, foaming mass still in the pot; but on lifting it\r\noff the stove, and allowing it to subside for a moment, it was found\r\nthat not more than a quart was left.\r\n\r\n“Sure, an here’s some lovely flavorin I found,” said Pat, “in the\r\npantry. It’ll make a good flavorin to the candy, so it will.”\r\n\r\nHe held forth a small vial to Phil, which was labelled,--\r\n\r\n_Extract of Lemon._\r\n\r\nPhil thought it would be an improvement, and so poured the whole\r\ncontents of the vial into the boiling molasses.\r\n\r\nHis task was soon over, and the candy was taken off, and poured into\r\ndishes to cool. There was only a little, but it was hoped that this\r\nmight suffice for the present.\r\n\r\nAt length they ventured to taste it. But the first taste excited one\r\nuniversal cry of execration. The taste was of rancid oil, and not by\r\nany means the smooth, sweet, delicious lemon-flavored molasses candy for\r\nwhich they had waited so long. In bitter disappointment and vexation,\r\nPhil seized the vial which Pat had handed him. He smelt it; he poured\r\nsome of the last drops out on his hand, and touched it.\r\n\r\n“Boys,” said he, with a rueful look, “the steward of the Petrel must\r\nhave taken a lemon bottle to keep his hair-oil in.”\r\n\r\nAnd all the boys retired from the cook’s galley with a mournful smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n_Ingenuity of Tom and Phil.--Checkers and Chess.--Speculations as to\r\nthe Future.--Melancholy Forebodings.--Where is the Antelope?--A Change\r\nof Weather.--Solemn Preparations by Solomon.--Making ready for\r\nthe Worst.--The Place of Retreat.--Laying in a Stock of\r\nProvisions.--Pitching a Tent.--Reconnaissance in Force.--A midnight\r\nAlarm.--Horror of Solomon.--A haunted Ship.--Sleepers awakened.--They go\r\nto lay the Ghost.--Forth into the Night._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE boys thus succeeded in filling the day with sufficient incidents\r\nto occupy their thoughts. It was not an unpleasant day; indeed, it was\r\nafterwards looked back upon by all of them as one of the marked days\r\nin their lives. True, most of the molasses had been lost, and the\r\nremainder, which had been turned into candy, had not been recommended\r\nto their palates by the addition of the hair-oil of the steward of the\r\nPetrel; but to active-minded boys these little disappointments caused\r\nno trouble whatever; on the contrary, they only furnished material\r\nfor endless jests and laughter. The conclusion of the whole affair was\r\nreached when the party once more formed themselves into a meeting, at\r\nwhich it was moved, seconded, and unanimously voted, “that the thanks of\r\nthis meeting be conveyed to Solomon for his generous loan of the cook’s\r\ngalley.”\r\n\r\nAfter this, Tom, who always was remarkably fruitful in devices,\r\nconceived the idea of making a checker-board. He was able to do this\r\nwithout any very great difficulty. He obtained the head of a flour\r\nbarrel, and with some soot and water he was able to mark out the squares\r\nvery well indeed. He then obtained the covers of some red herring boxes,\r\nwhich he cut up into the checker pieces, blackening them with soot. He\r\nthen challenged Bruce to a game. Bruce played, and won; but, as at the\r\nend of that time Bruce, who had chosen the black men, found his fingers\r\nand face all covered with soot, and his fingers, moreover, smelling most\r\nabominably of stale red herring, his victory did not seem to give him\r\nthat satisfaction which it might be supposed to have caused.\r\n\r\nFired by Tom’s example, Phil undertook a more ambitious task, which was\r\nnothing less than to make a set of chess-men. He went about the pantry,\r\nand succeeded in finding a number of corks, which he attempted to cut\r\ninto the required shapes. His knife, however, was rather dull, and he\r\nhimself was not particularly skilful at carving; so that when the pieces\r\nwere completed, it required a great effort of the imagination to see the\r\nconnection between the corks and the pieces which they were supposed\r\nto represent, and a still greater effort of memory to retain the\r\nrecollection of such resemblance. He challenged Bart to a game, and the\r\ntwo attempted to play; but, after a dozen moves, attended by a dozen\r\ndisputes, the game resolved itself into an insoluble problem as to\r\nwhether a certain piece, belonging to Phil, was a pawn or a queen. All\r\npresent took part in the discussion, but, after a long debate, it was\r\nleft undecided; and so the game broke down.\r\n\r\nAfter tea they adjourned to the quarter-deck. Here all was pleasant, and\r\nsoothing, and agreeable. A gentle breeze still blew as before, and the\r\nprospect of this tranquil weather continued. The boys sang, and told\r\nstories, and chatted for hours. They speculated much as to the time when\r\nthe Antelope might be expected back again. Some thought that she might\r\nbe back by the evening of the next day, but others were inclined to\r\nallow her a longer time.\r\n\r\n“For my part,” said Bart, “I think well have to allow about three\r\ndays--one day to go to the Magdalen Islands, one day to hunt up the\r\nsails, and one day to come back.”\r\n\r\n“O, he needn’t be so long as that,” said Phil. “I should think he could\r\nget to the Magdalen Islands in far less time. They can’t be over fifty\r\nmiles away, and this breeze would take him there in fifteen hours or\r\nso. He left here at about six yesterday; he probably got there at\r\nabout twelve to-day. He could hunt all over the islands before dark at\r\nfarthest; and, of course, he’ll come straight back after he gets the\r\nsails. He probably left there this evening at sundown, and he may be\r\nhere to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“O, I don’t know,” said Bruce. “I dare say he did leave this evening to\r\ncome back; but, mind you, my boy, this wind’s against him. He’ll have to\r\ntack coming back, and the Antelope isn’t much at that. I don’t believe\r\nhe’ll do it by to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Three days, I think, will have to be allowed,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Well, three days ought to do it at the farthest,” said Tom. “He\r\ncertainly won’t wait at the Magdalen Islands. The only thing that’ll\r\nkeep him’ll be the head winds.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, an’ for my part,” said Pat, “he may stay three weeks, if he\r\nlikes. This place is over an over again betther than the Antelope.”\r\n\r\n“O, I don’t know,” said Bart. “It’s all very well while the wind\r\nis this way, but if an easterly or southerly wind should come up, it\r\nwouldn’t be so comfortable. A heavy sea would roll through and through\r\nthe cabin, and we’d have to live, and eat, and sleep up here.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, an ayvin that wouldn’t be so bad.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if it were to rain at the same time,” said Bruce, “it might be\r\na little damp up here; and I’m afraid we wouldn’t have quite so good a\r\ntable.”\r\n\r\n“I only hope that the Antelope’ll get back before it begins to blow,”\r\n said Tom.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bart, “it’s all very well in fine weather; for I’d rather\r\nbe on board here than in the Antelope; but if the weather is going to\r\nchange, I’d a precious sight rather have the Antelope within hail.”\r\n\r\n“O, well,” said Phil, cheerily, “there’s no sign of a blow just yet, at\r\nany rate; so I suppose we needn’t talk about that. I’ve no doubt this\r\nweather’ll hold on for a day or so longer, and by that time, at the\r\nfarthest, the Antelope will be here.”\r\n\r\n“If the Antelope were really in sight,” said Bart, “I don’t believe I\r\nshould give one thought to the weather; but the fact that she is away\r\nmakes the subject a very important one. This head wind may detain her,\r\nand if it were to blow hard, it would be bad for us.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bruce, “I believe that if it did blow hard, the wind would\r\nchange; and in that case, it would be all the more favorable for the\r\nAntelope, and, of course, bring her here all the faster. So, at the\r\nworst, our hardships couldn’t last more than a few hours.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a good deal in that,” said Bart; “I didn’t think of it before.”\r\n\r\nSuch were their speculations as to the Antelope; but all these, together\r\nwith all apprehensions of danger, and all fears about the change of\r\nweather, were soon forgotten in a sound and refreshing sleep.\r\n\r\nThe next morning came, and their conversation of the previous night made\r\nevery one think of the Antelope. On going upon deck, their first thought\r\nwas of her. But of the Antelope there was not a sign, nor was any sail\r\nvisible whatever. Little did they imagine that at that moment, instead\r\nof steering his bark back to them, Captain Corbet was sailing away from\r\nthem, and directing his course to Miramichi. But the weather was fine,\r\nand the breeze was still mild; and so, after one glance around, they all\r\ndismissed the subject.\r\n\r\nBreakfast, and morning occupations, and games, and swimming, and various\r\nother pastimes, took up the interval until midday, when dinner came to\r\nengage their attention.\r\n\r\nOn going upon deck after dinner, they noticed a change in the appearance\r\nof sea and sky. Clouds were visible on the horizon, and the wind had\r\nshifted. It was blowing from another quarter. It had been north-east. It\r\nwas now south-east. It was also a little stronger than it had been, and\r\ncreated more than a ripple on the water. The surface of the sea was now\r\nagitated, and the halcyon times of calm had passed. The boys noted all\r\nthese things at one glance.\r\n\r\n“It’s going to be rough,” said Bart. “The wind has changed, and it’s\r\ngoing to blow.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bruce, “let it blow. It’ll be fair for the Antelope, and\r\nfetch her up all the faster.”\r\n\r\n“It’s an ill wind that blows no good,” said Tom, quietly.\r\n\r\n“Let her rip,” said Phil.\r\n\r\nThe boys were not by any means inclined to borrow trouble, and so they\r\nsoon drove away these thoughts, and began to get up amusements of the\r\nold sort. They ransacked the cabin, they peered into places heretofore\r\nneglected. Nothing, however, of any particular interest rewarded their\r\nsearches. So the afternoon passed away.\r\n\r\nThe tea table was set. Solomon did his best. All praised the repast,\r\nas something of a superior order. This time Solomon did not kindle, and\r\nglow, and chuckle at the praises of his young friends, but preserved a\r\ndemeanor of unchangeable gravity.\r\n\r\nAs they sat at table, they all noticed a slight motion in the vessel,\r\nwhich would not have been regarded under ordinary circumstances, but\r\nwhich now, in their very peculiar situation, excited comment.\r\n\r\n“The wind is increasing,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“I dare say we’ll have a blow to-night,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“If there’s much more motion, we must expect to get a ducking,” said\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n“Any way,” said Phil, “my berth’s out of the reach of the water; it’s\r\nthe upper one.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, thin, an I’ll have to change my berth to an upper one,” said Pat,\r\n“if that’s what ye’re thinkin of.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bruce, “it’ll be all the better for the Antelope. The wind\r\nwon’t be much, after all. We’ll only feel it because we’re so low in the\r\nwater.”\r\n\r\n“O, of course,” said Bart; “and if the worst comes to the worst, we can\r\ngo to the quarterdeck.”\r\n\r\nThe change in their prospects, however, did not in the slightest degree\r\naffect the appetite of the boys; but, on the contrary, they exhibited a\r\ngreater devotion than ordinary to this repast, as though they were all\r\nunder the impression that this might be the last one which they were to\r\neat under such luxurious circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis impression, if it did exist, was confirmed after tea, when they\r\nwent out upon deck. Solomon was there, grave and preoccupied.\r\n\r\n“Chilen,” said he, in a mild voice, “we mus get some ’visium up dis\r\nyar ebenin on to dat ar quarter-deck. I ben a riggin some tackle to\r\nhist up some barls ob biscuit. Dar’s water up dar already, two barls, an\r\ndat’ll be nuff for de present. You’ll all hab to len a han, an hist up\r\nbiscuit barls; an you can fotch up as many oder tings as you can lay yer\r\nhans on.”\r\n\r\n“O, let’s wait till to-morrow,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“No, no; bes be in time,” said Solomon. “It’s a gwine to blow dis yer\r\nnight, an we’ve got to work so as to hab all tings ready.”\r\n\r\nNone of the boys were surprised at this; so they all prepared to lend a\r\nhand at the work. This was, as Solomon said, to hoist up some barrels\r\nof biscuit. These they rolled out from the store-room, and hoisted up to\r\nthe quarter-deck. They then lashed them round the mizzenmast securely.\r\nTwo stout seamen’s chests were then brought up, being first emptied of\r\ntheir contents, and into these the boys packed an assortment of such\r\narticles of food as might be desirable in the event of a prolonged\r\nstay on the quarter-deck, such as two hams, which Solomon, with wise\r\nforethought, had boiled, cheese, potted meats, knives, forks, mustard,\r\nbutter, salt, &c.\r\n\r\nThey now felt prepared to some extent for the worst; but the question\r\nstill remained, how they were to procure shelter in the event of rain.\r\nA diligent search resulted in the discovery of several tarpaulins. These\r\nthey hung over the boom, securing the ends on each side to the deck in\r\nsuch a way that a tent was formed, which was spacious enough to shelter\r\nthem all in case of need, and quite impervious to water. In the middle\r\nof this tent rose the skylight, which might serve for a table, or even\r\na sleeping-place, in case of need. Upon the top of this they spread some\r\nmattresses and blankets.\r\n\r\n“Dar,” said Solomon, “dat ar’s de best dat we can do; an if dis yer\r\nwind’s boun to rise, an dis yer vessel’s decks get a swimmin wid water,\r\nwe’ll be able to hab a dry place to lib in.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t believe we’ll have to use it,” said Tom; “but there’s\r\nnothing like having things ready.”\r\n\r\n“O, we’ll sleep all the sounder for this,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing like knowing that we’ve got a place to run to, if the\r\nworst comes to the worst.”\r\n\r\n“And then, even if the sea does wash over the decks,” said Phil, “all\r\nwe’ve got to do is, to take off our shoes and stockings, roll up our\r\ntrousers, and meander about barefoot.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, an there’s a good deal to be said in favor of goin barefoot,”\r\n remarked Pat.\r\n\r\n“O, well,” said Bruce, “it’ll only be for a little while; for I’ve no\r\ndoubt that the Antelope’ll be along some time to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate, we can get our sleep this night in our beds,” said Arthur.\r\n“I’m going to my old crib, and I mean to sleep there, too, till I’m\r\nwashed out of it.”\r\n\r\n“And so will I,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“And I,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“And I,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“And sure an meself will do that same too,” said Pat.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Bruce; “we’d be great fools not to sleep there as long\r\nas we can.”\r\n\r\nThe wind had increased a little, but not much, and the motion of the\r\nship was, after all, but slight.\r\n\r\nIt was rather the prospect before them than the present reality that had\r\nled to these preparations.\r\n\r\nTwo or three hours passed, and ten o’clock came. By that time the wind\r\nhad increased to a fresh, strong breeze, and the sea had risen into\r\nmoderate waves. The motion of the ship had grown to be a slow, regular\r\nrise and fall of about two feet. On walking to the bows, they saw that\r\nat every rise and fall the water came in through the scupper-holes and\r\nflowed over the deck.\r\n\r\n“Well, there it comes,” said Tom; “but for my part, I persist in\r\nrefusing to believe that it’ll be anything of consequence. I don’t\r\nbelieve it’ll get into the cabin. As to the deck here, a thorough\r\nwashing’ll do it good. I was thinking to-day that it needed one.”\r\n\r\n“O, it’ll not be much,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“Sure an where’s the harrum,” said Pat, “if it does come into the cabin,\r\nso long as we’re high up in our berths, out of reach?”\r\n\r\n“Solomon’ll have trouble in cooking to-morrow,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Then we’ll feed on biscuit,” said Arthur. “A few days ago we’d have\r\nbeen glad enough to be where we are now.”\r\n\r\n“That’s true,” said Bruce; “and, besides, tomorrow the Antelope’ll\r\nbe almost sure to be here. This wind’s fair, and as I’ve always said,\r\nwhat’s bad for us in one way is best for us in another, for-it’ll bring\r\nthe Antelope along all the faster.”\r\n\r\nIn this way they all made light of the change that had taken place; and,\r\nturning away, they all went to the cabin and retired to their respective\r\nberths. The lamp under the skylight was burning brightly, the cabin had\r\nits usual cheerful appearance, and the comforts here served still more\r\nto make them overlook the troubles outside.\r\n\r\nSo they all went to bed.\r\n\r\nFor a few hours they slept.\r\n\r\nThen they were awakened by a cry--a wild, wailing cry, a cry of terror\r\nand of despair. Every one started up at once. The cry came again from\r\nthe cabin.\r\n\r\n“O, chilen, we’re lost! we’re done for! we’re ru-i-na-ted for ebbemo!”\r\n\r\n“Hallo, Solomon!” cried Bart. “What are you making all that row about?”\r\n\r\nAnd as he said this he jumped out of his berth. As he entered the cabin\r\none glance reassured him partially. The lamps were burning; they had\r\nallowed them to burn for this night; the floor was dry. Everything\r\nhad the same air of comfort which had prevailed when they retired. The\r\nmotion of the ship was certainly greater, perhaps even much greater; but\r\nunder any other circumstances it would not have been noticed. This\r\nmuch Bart saw first; and then he noticed a figure bowed over the table,\r\nsighing and groaning. It was Solomon. His head was buried in his hands.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Bart, laying his hand on Solomon’s shoulder. “What’s the\r\nmatter? What’s upset you so?”\r\n\r\nSolomon raised his head and grasped Bart’s arm convulsively in both of\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\n“Dar’s ghosts about!”\r\n\r\n“Ghosts?\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mas’r Bart; d-d-d-dars g-g-ghosts a-b-b-b-bout,” said Solomon,\r\nwith a shudder and with chattering teeth.\r\n\r\n“Pooh! nonsense! What do you mean?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\nBy this time all the other boys were out in the cabin. They had all gone\r\nto bed with their clothes on, and stood now wide awake and prepared for\r\nany emergency. They all stared fixedly at Solomon, expecting to hear\r\nsome dreadful disclosure. They had never before seen him so completely\r\nupset.\r\n\r\n“Dar’s g-g-ghosts a-b-b-b-b-b-b-oard,” said Solomon. “I went to bed. I\r\nwaked at de row dey made down below, in de hole.”\r\n\r\n“What, in the hold?”\r\n\r\n“Y-y-yes, Mas’r Bart, in d-d-d-d-e hole ob de ship. It’s a haunted\r\nship--an--full ob hobgobblums.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said Bart, with a sigh of relief; “is that all? Some nightmare\r\nor other. Never mind, old Solomon; it’s all right; we’ll go and lay the\r\nghosts. You come and show me the place.”\r\n\r\n“Darsn’t,” gasped Solomon.\r\n\r\n“If you’ll come with us, you know; we’ll all go.”\r\n\r\n“D-d-d-arsn’t,” said Solomon again.\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ll go, and T think it’ll be better for you to come with us\r\nthan to stay here alone,” said Bart. “Come along, boys; let’s find out\r\nwhat it is. Perhaps something’s the matter.”\r\n\r\nWith these words he went out.\r\n\r\nThe other boys followed.\r\n\r\nSolomon gave one wild glance around, and then, finding himself forsaken,\r\nand dreading the loneliness, he hurried after the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n_Rushing forth at the Alarm of Solomon.--The rolling Waters.--The\r\nflooded Decks.--Strange, uneartlily Noises.--Dread Fears.--is the Ship\r\nbreaking up?--Consolations.--Refuge in the Cabin.--A Barricade\r\nagainst the Waters.--A damp Abode.--A Debate.--Where shall we pass\r\nthe Night?--Solomon on Guards--The fourth Day.--No Antelope.--A long\r\nWatch.--The Cabin deserted.--Sleeping on Deck._\r\n\r\n\r\nAT the alarm of Solomon, the boys thus all hurried out upon deck. The\r\nnight was dark. The sky was overcast. The motion of the ship was greater\r\nthan it had been. As they stepped out, they felt their feet plash in a\r\nstream of water that rolled towards them, and perceived by this that the\r\nwaves had risen high enough to break over the low-lying deck. But it\r\nwas only enough to wet the deck, and not enough to cause either alarm\r\nor even discomfort, since it had not penetrated to the cabin. As they\r\nadvanced forward, however, they encountered deeper streams of water,\r\nwhich swept down from the bows towards them, rising as high as their\r\nankles. Yet even this excited but little attention. Solomon’s alarm had\r\nprepared them all for something serious, and so slight a thing as this\r\nwas not deemed worthy of notice. They hurried on, therefore, and at\r\nlength having reached the forecastle, they stood and looked all around.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the vessel would have been considered very ordinary in\r\nany one differently situated. The waves had risen somewhat, and at their\r\nmotion the ship rose and fell about four feet. This was sufficient to\r\nbring her deck under the surface of the sea, and at each fall the water\r\nstreamed in and rolled about. The wind was rather fresh, but not by any\r\nmeans violent, and it sighed through the rigging overhead.\r\n\r\n“Why, Solomon,” said Bart, at length, “what do you mean? I don’t see\r\nthat anything’s happened.”\r\n\r\nSolomon had been clinging to the outskirts of the party, and at this he.\r\ncried out,--\r\n\r\n“Dey ain’t out dar! Dey’s inside.”\r\n\r\n“Inside? Where?”\r\n\r\n“In dar!” said Solomon, pointing to the door of the forecastle.\r\n\r\nAt this Bart went in, followed by all the boys. A dim lamp was burning,\r\nsuspended from a beam. The boys looked around, and saw the seamen’s\r\nberths, but nothing more.\r\n\r\n“There isn’t anything here,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Solomon grasped Bart’s arm, and said, with a gasp,--\r\n\r\n“Jes’ you listen to ‘em!”\r\n\r\nThe boys all listened.\r\n\r\nAs they listened, there arose a confused medley of sounds, which seemed\r\nto come from the hold of the ship--sounds of pounding, thumping, and\r\ngrinding, mingled with groanings, gurglings, sobs, choking sighs,\r\nsqueals, scrapings, rumblings, tumblings, shiverings, and many others of\r\nan indefinable character. To these the boys all listened in silence,\r\nand for a time there came a solemn feeling of awe over every one of that\r\nlittle band of listeners.\r\n\r\n“D-d-d-dem’s um!” said Solomon, with a shudder. “D-d-d-dem’s d-d-de\r\ng-g-g-ghosts, d-d-d-dem’s d-d-de hobble-bobble-gobblums!”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” said Bart. “Don’t talk that trash just now. This may be\r\nsomething serious.”\r\n\r\n“The cargo seems moving,” said Bruce. “The leak may be a large one.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say she’s got a bad strain,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“It’s very likely,” said Arthur, solemnly, “that she won’t last very\r\nlong.”\r\n\r\n“That’s my own idea,” said Tom. “Come, boys, we may as well look the\r\nworst in the face. It’s my opinion that she’s breaking up.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ve got the captain’s gig,” said Pat, “an can take to that, so\r\nwe can. We’ve got lots of provisions.”\r\n\r\n“But we’ve no oars,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Well, we can rig up a bit of a sail, so we can, out of thim ould\r\ntarpowlines.”\r\n\r\n“After all, though,” said Bruce, “she may not be breaking up. I’ve\r\nheard somewhere that in a water-logged ship the water makes the most\r\nextraordinary noises ever heard whenever there is the slightest motion;\r\nso these may, after all, be nothing more than the usual noises.”\r\n\r\n“And besides, what is this sea!” said Bart; “it can’t do anything; it’s\r\nnothing. In fact, the more I think of it, the more sure I feel that\r\nthis ship can’t break up, unless she strikes a rock. I remember what sea\r\ncaptains have told me--that a timber ship may float and drift about for\r\nfifty years, and hold together without any trouble, unless it should\r\nstrike a rock or be driven ashore. So now that I think of it, I don’t\r\nbelieve there’s the slightest danger.”\r\n\r\n“But, if that is so, why did the captain of the Petrel desert her? He\r\nmust have known this, if it is so.”\r\n\r\nThis was Tom’s objection, who was not quite inclined to receive Bart’s\r\nassertion.\r\n\r\n“Well, I dare say he hadn’t been in the timber trade,” said Bart. “This\r\nwas something new for him, and he thought she would go to pieces. That’s\r\nwhat he wrote in the message that he put in the bottle.”\r\n\r\nThis conversation had not been lost on Solomon, whose fears, prompted by\r\nsuperstition, gradually faded away, and finally died out. The true cause\r\nof the terrific noises being thus asserted and accepted by the boys,\r\nthere was no difficulty on Solomon’s part about adopting it. Accordingly\r\nhe soon regained his ordinary equanimity, and began to potter about the\r\nforecastle, arranging some dishes and pans.\r\n\r\nThe descent of Solomon from the supernatural to the commonplace had a\r\ngood effect upon the boys, who, seeing that he had suddenly lost all his\r\nfears, thought it time to throw aside their own anxieties.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Phil, “I don’t see the use of staying in this dismal\r\nforecastle any longer, when there is a comfortable cabin aft; so I’m\r\ngoing back to my berth.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s meself,” cried Pat, “that was jist goin to say that same.”\r\n\r\n“I think it’s about the best thing we can do, boys,” said Bruce.\r\n“There’s no danger just yet, evidently, and so there’s no reason why\r\nwe should lose our night’s rest. Let’s sleep while we can, say I, and I\r\ndare say the Antelope’ll be along some time to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nUpon this proposal the boys acted forthwith, and soon they were all not\r\nonly back again in their berths, but slumbering profoundly. Solomon also\r\nturned in “forard,” and finished his night’s sleep, which, however, was\r\nfrequently interrupted by excursions and reconnoitrings which he made\r\nfor the purpose of seeing how the weather was.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning they all awaked early, and hurried upon deck.\r\nThis was the third day since the Antelope had left, and by evening\r\nthe three days would be completed which they allowed for her probable\r\nabsence. There was not one of them who did not go up on deck that\r\nmorning with the expectation of seeing her somewhere in the distance.\r\nBut on looking around, they saw no sail of any kind. It was with a\r\nfeeling of disappointment that they recognized this fact, for, though\r\nthus far they had not encountered any danger, they had, at least, become\r\naware of the fact that an increase of wind might make their situation\r\nvery dangerous indeed.\r\n\r\nThe wind also had grown stronger, and sang through the rigging in a way\r\nthat was anything but music to their ears. The sky was overcast with\r\nrolling clouds. In another vessel they would have called it a fine day,\r\nand a fresh breeze, but to them it became equivalent to a storm. The\r\nwaves had risen to a height commensurate with the increase of the wind.\r\nThe rise and fall of the ship amounted to about six feet, and at every\r\nother plunge her bows went entirely under water. The deck was now\r\ncompletely flooded, and Solomon in traversing it was sometimes up to his\r\nknees in the rushing torrent. The fire in the cook’s galley had been put\r\nout, and he had been compelled to transfer his apparatus to the stove in\r\nthe cabin.\r\n\r\nThe quarter-deck astern prevented the sea from coming aboard in that\r\ndirection; and by the time the water that rolled over the bows had\r\nreached the cabin doors, it had greatly subsided; yet still enough had\r\npoured into the cabin to saturate it in every nook and corner. A pool\r\nof water filled all the cabin and all the state-rooms to a depth of six\r\ninches, and rolled about with the motion of the ship.\r\n\r\n“Well, this isn’t certainly quite as comfortable as it might be,” said\r\nPhil, with a blank look.\r\n\r\n“At this rate,” said Tom, “if this, sort of thing keeps on, we’ll have\r\nto launch the boat, and row to the cook’s galley.”\r\n\r\n“It’s strange that the Antelope isn’t in sight!” said Arthur, shading\r\nhis eyes, and trying to force them to see.\r\n\r\n“No use,” said Bart, who had been peering through the glass, and now\r\nhanded it to Arthur. “No use. There’s not only no Antelope, but no other\r\nvessel; in fact, there’s not a sign of any sail of any kind whatever.”\r\n\r\nAt this Arthur, who had already exhausted all the capabilities of\r\nthe spy-glass, took it, and began sweeping the entire circuit of the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n“O, don’t trouble yourselves, boys,” said Bruce. “It isn’t quite time\r\nyet for the Antelope to get here. We allowed her three days. They won’t\r\nbe up till evening. Besides, she’s just as likely to be four days; she’s\r\nnot over fast. For my part, I don’t intend to look for her to-day at\r\nall. It’s quite possible that a vessel may heave in sight; but I don’t\r\nbelieve it’ll be the Antelope. And if any vessel does turn up, we can\r\neasily signalize, for I found all the signal-flags of the Petrel in the\r\ncloset next my state-room.”\r\n\r\nThat morning Solomon had to cook the breakfast in the cabin. The boys\r\nall concluded to go about barefoot. The breakfast was cooked, and,\r\nconsidering all the circumstances, was a great success; but the glory\r\nof the cabin had departed, and it was hardly to be expected that a\r\nbreakfast could be thoroughly enjoyable at which one had to sit with\r\nthe water playing all about his feet and ankles. Still the boys made the\r\nbest of it, and did ample justice to the fare. Solomon still struggled\r\nmanfully against the difficulties of his position, and on this occasion\r\nactually furnished them with hot rolls. These, with broiled ham, coffee,\r\ntea, and other things, made a breakfast that was not to be despised.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the boys were glad to leave the cabin, and seek the\r\nquarter-deck, which arose like an island out of the water. They began to\r\nlook upon this quarter-deck as a place that was likely to become their\r\nhome. The sashes of the skylight were kept open and made use of, as\r\naffording a readier means of passing in and out of the cabin. They began\r\nto feel very seriously the restriction of space which had been caused\r\nby the flowing waters, and the charms of the comfortable cabin had never\r\nseemed so great as when they were deprived of them. Formerly they had\r\nbeen able to lounge in and out, and, above all, to prolong the various\r\nrepasts, and thus pass away the time; but now breakfast, dinner, and\r\ntea had to be hurried over as rapidly as possible, and there came the\r\nprospect of final banishment from the cabin altogether.\r\n\r\nThe sea at midday was somewhat rougher; but Solomon heroically cooked\r\nthe dinner in the cabin, although the water was sometimes half way up to\r\nhis knees. Measures were now taken to keep the water out. The door was\r\nshut and locked, and in the interstices they fastened oakum. Had\r\nthis been done at the first, the cabin might have been saved; but\r\nunfortunately it had been neglected, and now that the water was\r\nin, there was no way of getting it out. Still this was a decided\r\nimprovement, and there was comfort in the thought that it could not grow\r\nany worse now, unless it became very bad indeed.\r\n\r\nDinner was served in the cabin, and the boys did justice to it, though\r\nthey showed no inclination to linger at the table any longer than was\r\nabsolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner they sought the quarter-deck, where they spent the\r\nafternoon. They had now begun to look for the coming of the Antelope\r\nwith great impatience, and their anxiety in this respect kept them in a\r\nstate of suspense which did not allow them to feel interest in any other\r\nthing. To all of them the time seemed interminable. The spyglass was\r\npassed around a hundred times, and each one on using it seemed reluctant\r\nto give it up. But at every fresh survey of the horizon there was the\r\nsame result; and as hour after hour passed, they began to fear that\r\nsomething might have happened to Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\nSo the time passed. All the afternoon the wind grew higher, and the\r\nrolling of the vessel increased; still they took tea in the cabin; and\r\nthere arose the important question as to where they should sleep.\r\n\r\nThe opinions varied. Some of them, in view of the fact that the wind\r\nwas rather increasing than diminishing, were inclined to desert their\r\nstaterooms, and sleep on the quarter-deck, upon the skylight, under the\r\nfriendly shelter of the tarpaulin.\r\n\r\nTom advocated this most strongly.\r\n\r\n“It’ll be just as comfortable,” said he, “and much less liable to\r\ninterruption. Here are our mattresses, all spread out, and roomy enough\r\nfor all of us. Here is the tarpaulin hanging over the boom, and making\r\na first-rate tent. Down in the cabin the water seems to be slowly\r\nincreasing, and we’ll be liable to be washed out of our berths before\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Phil, who chimed in with Tom, “and what’s worse, if the sea\r\ngets rougher, we’ll be certain to ship some seas astern before morning,\r\nand in that case it’ll come pouring into the cabin through the\r\nskylight.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if it does,” said Bruce, “we should get as wet on the skylight as\r\nin the cabin.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Arthur, “and we might be washed off into the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an we can lash ourselves to the mast, an sleep there,” said Pat.\r\n“That’s what shipwrecked sailors always do.”\r\n\r\n“O, there’s all the difference in the world,” said Tom. “If we are\r\nabove, we’ll be able to avoid any danger, but down below there we’ll\r\nonly be drowned like rats in a hole. For my part, if the sea is coming\r\nin, I should like to be where I can have a chance to swim, at least.”\r\n\r\n“O, come now, Tom,” said Bart, “you are putting it too strong\r\naltogether. The wind hasn’t increased very much, and the change has been\r\nvery gradual. There’s no likelihood of any sudden change, you know. If\r\nit gets much rougher, we’ll find it out soon enough, and we’ll be able\r\nto get out of the cabin, I should think, before it gets filled with\r\nwater. If the ship begins to pitch like that, so as to ship heavy seas\r\nastern, the first one that comes aboard will be enough to wake every\r\nmother’s son of us. I believe in sticking to the cabin as long as we\r\ncan. Our berths are as comfortable as ever. The puddle of water about\r\nthe floor don’t really amount to much, after all. The door is so tight\r\nnow that very little more water can get in; and as to shipping seas over\r\nthe stern, I, for my part, don’t believe that there is any danger of\r\nthat just yet; not to-night, at any rate.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bruce. “Just see. After all, there’s been no very great\r\nchange since morning. If we were aboard the Antelope, we’d think nothing\r\nof this.”\r\n\r\n“But unfortunately,” said Tom, “we’re not aboard the Antelope.”\r\n\r\n“O, well,” said Bruce, cheerfully, “we needn’t bother ourselves. We’re\r\npretty certain to be aboard of her to-morrow, if we choose to go, for by\r\nthat time she’s sure to show herself. We allowed her three days, and the\r\ntime is up; but we ought to allow one day more in case of unlooked-for\r\ndelays. Perhaps Captain Corbet had to wait for the sails, getting them\r\nmended, and all that sort of thing. I don’t think he’d wait more\r\nthan one day, at the farthest; so we may look for him tomorrow pretty\r\nconfidently. And in the mean time, I’m of Bart’s opinion, and think\r\nthat we’d better make ourselves comfortable as long as we can, and\r\nsleep below until we are driven out. I don’t believe we’ll be driven out\r\nto-night, at any rate; and if we are, we’ll have plenty of warning.”\r\n\r\nThe end of it was, that they all decided to sleep below. Solomon,\r\nhowever, who had been present at the discussion, informed them that\r\nhe would sleep on deck, and keep one eye open. Some remonstrance was\r\noffered, but in vain, and at length this arrangement was entered into.\r\n\r\nFortunately the night passed without any accident. Their sleep was\r\nundisturbed. On waking in the morning, they found not much increase in\r\nthe water inside the cabin, but felt that the vessel was pitching about\r\nmore than ever, and creaking and groaning in every timber.\r\n\r\nHurrying out on deck, they looked eagerly around. Bruce was up first,\r\nand seizing the spyglass, scanned the whole horizon in the most\r\nsearching manner. But not to the eyes of any one, nor to the searching\r\ngaze of Bruce, appeared any sail whatever. Not one word was said. The\r\ndisappointment of all amounted almost to dismay for a moment, and their\r\nfeelings were too strong for utterance.\r\n\r\nAll around them the sea arose in foaming billows. Overhead the sky\r\nwas covered with clouds that drove onward impetuously. The wind howled\r\nthrough the rigging; the ‘ship labored and plunged, shipping heavy\r\nseas, and thrusting her bows far under the rolling waves. But the\r\nquarter-deck, as yet, was spared, and rose above the seas like an\r\nisland, whereon they could rest.\r\n\r\nThis day passed like the previous one. They spent the whole time looking\r\nfor the Antelope. It was now the fourth day since her departure, and\r\nher delay made all feel uneasy. The cabin was now too uncomfortable for\r\nthem, so that they decided to eat their meals on the quarter-deck; but\r\nSolomon cooked their meals in the cabin stove, and struggled heroically\r\nagainst fate in the effort to afford his young friends the best fare\r\nthat could be furnished. .\r\n\r\nThe day passed slowly.\r\n\r\nNo Antelope!\r\n\r\nNight came.\r\n\r\nThis time there was no debate about a sleeping-place. No one thought\r\nof going below, and they all stretched their weary frames on the\r\nmattresses, which were laid on the skylight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n_A strange Sleeping-place.--The Tent.--The View astern.--Rolling Waters\r\nin Pursuit.--Morning.--Astonishing Discovery.--The solid Land moving\r\ntowards the anchored Ship.--How to account for it.--What Land is\r\nthis?--Various Theories.--Every one has a different Opinion.--Solomon\r\ndriven from the Cabin.--Drawing nearer.--An iron-bound Coast._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEIR sleep that night was somewhat disturbed, for the novelty of their\r\nposition prevented them from having that placidity of mind which is the\r\nbest promoter of slumber. At times through the night they awaked, and\r\nwere sensible of the rush of waters about the ship’s quarter, and\r\nalso of a greater motion of the vessel, accompanied by all manner of\r\ncreakings and groan-ings. The tarpaulins hung over them, having been\r\nsecured in such a fashion as to form an excellent tent, opening towards\r\nthe stern, and closed at the other end by the mizzen-mast and the\r\nbarrels of biscuit and other things around it. Through the opening\r\nastern they could see at times, as the ship sunk, the phosphorescent\r\ngleam of foaming billows rolling around them as if about to break over\r\nthem. Most of these did dash themselves against the ship, but none fell\r\nupon the quarterdeck; all that the boys felt was the fine spray which\r\nfloated under their resting-place, and saturated everything.\r\n\r\nNone of them, however, attempted to rise and go forth until daybreak.\r\nThere was no cause for doing so; their sleeping-place was the most\r\ncomfortable now left in the ship, and the scene without had no\r\nattraction strong enough to draw them away. Day dawned, and still there\r\nwas some hesitation about getting up.\r\n\r\nThis day was the fifth since the departure of the Antelope. Their\r\nsituation was now quite serious; but they had not yet seen any signs of\r\nCaptain Corbet. They looked forward towards seeing him on this day, but\r\nthe disappointment of the two previous days made them despondent, and\r\neach one dreaded to look out, for fear that his forebodings might\r\nbe confirmed. This was the waking thought of each, and each one also\r\nperceived that this day was worse than any they had known yet. If the\r\nAntelope still kept away, they scarcely knew what to hope for.\r\n\r\nAt length they went forth, and looked around. All over the sea the\r\nwaves were larger, and rougher, and fiercer. The motion of the ship\r\nwas greater than ever. It seemed as though the billows, that raced and\r\nchased about in all directions, were hurrying to overwhelm her. The deck\r\nbelow was all covered with white foam, and at times the bows plunged\r\nso far under water, and remained there so long, and were overwhelmed by\r\nsuch floods of rolling billows, that it seemed as though the ship would\r\nnever again emerge. The quarterdeck was now more than ever like an\r\nisland; but every moment lessened its security, and brought it more and\r\nmore within reach of the ravenous waves that surged around on all sides.\r\nSuch was the sight that met their view, as they took their first look\r\naround.\r\n\r\nBut for all this they had been prepared during the long night, by all\r\nthat they had felt, and heard, and seen; and therefore this did not\r\naffect them so much. It was the long, eager look which they turned\r\ntowards the distant sea, the sharp, scrutinizing gaze with which they\r\nswept the horizon, that brought the deepest trouble; for there, over the\r\nwide surface of the waters, not a single sail was visible; and the fifth\r\nday, while it brought fresh calamities, brought no Antelope, and no hope\r\nof relief.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Pat gave a loud shout.\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” he cried; “what in the wide wurruld is it that I see over\r\nthere? Sure it’s draimin I must be.”\r\n\r\nAll the boys looked in the direction where Pat was pointing.\r\n\r\n“It’s land!” cried Bruce, in tones of amazement. .\r\n\r\n“Land!”\r\n\r\n“Land!”\r\n\r\n“Land!” burst from the other boys, who, with inexpressible wonder,\r\nlooked at the unaccountable sight, and scarcely were able to believe\r\nwhat they saw.\r\n\r\nYet it was land--most unmistakably. There it rose, a long, blue line,\r\napparently about fifteen miles away. It was a rugged shore, and extended\r\nalong the horizon for some distance. For such a sight as this they had\r\nnot been in the slightest degree prepared; in fact, they would have\r\nexpected anything sooner; for how could the land move itself up to their\r\nfast-anchored ship? Yet there was the fact, and before that fact they\r\nwere simply confounded.\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand it at all,” said Bruce. “If it had been foggy during\r\nthe last few days, or even hazy, I could then understand it; but it’s\r\nbeen particularly bright and clear all the time.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if it can be something like mirage,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bart. “The mirage never appears, except when the sea is\r\nperfectly still.”\r\n\r\n“My opinion is,” said Arthur, “that the ship’s been dragging her anchor,\r\nand has been drifting all these five days; or, at any rate, ever since\r\nthe wind rose.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps she has broken loose,” said Tom. “The chain may have had a weak\r\nlink. I remember the anchor went down with a tremendous jerk.”\r\n\r\n“For my part,” said Phil, “I’m half inclined to believe that the anchor\r\nnever got to the bottom. I don’t know how deep the water is in the\r\nmiddle of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, but I remember thinking at the time\r\nthat it was a very short chain to reach to the bottom of the sea. I\r\nremember wondering that the gulf was so shallow, but I thought that\r\nCaptain Corbet knew what he was about; but now, the more I think of\r\nit, the more sure I feel that Captain Corbet did _not_ know what he\r\nwas about, but dropped anchor, and let things slide, after his usual\r\ncareless fashion. He confessed, over and over, that he knew nothing at\r\nall about these waters; and he never once took the trouble to sound, or\r\nto try and hunt up a chart. No; he has dropped anchor, and the anchor\r\nhas never begun to get near the bottom. The consequence is, we’ve been\r\ndrifting along ever since he left us, and are now ever so many miles\r\naway from the place where the anchor was dropped. And, what’s worse, I\r\ndare say the Antelope was back there two days ago; but we were gone, and\r\nso, of course, Captain Corbet’s lost us, and has no more idea where to\r\nlook for us than a child.”\r\n\r\nPhil’s theory was so plausible, that it was at once accepted by all the\r\nboys. It seemed the most natural way of accounting for everything,--for\r\nthe absence of the Antelope, and the appearance of this strange shore.\r\nFor a time a deep gloom fell over all, and they stood in silence,\r\nstaring at the land.\r\n\r\nOut of this gloom Tom was the first to rouse himself.\r\n\r\n“I tell you what it is, boys,” said he, at length, “I don’t know that\r\nit’s so bad a thing after all. The more I think of it, the better it\r\nseems. I’d ten times sooner be near some land, as we are now, than be\r\nfar away out in the midst of the sea, with nothing to be seen, day after\r\nday, but sky and water. It seems to me that we must be drawing nearer to\r\nthe land, and before evening we may be close enough to see what sort\r\nof a country it is. If the worst comes to the worst, we can launch the\r\nboat, and go ashore. It’s a little rough, but, after all, not too rough\r\nfor the boat. I’ve been out in an open boat when the water was quite as\r\nrough as this. It seems rough to us, because the ship is water-logged,\r\nand is drifting every way--end on, side on, and so forth.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder what land it is,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“If we only knew how the wind has been, we might guess how we have been\r\ndrifting,” said Bruce; “but the wind has changed once or twice, and I’ve\r\nnever kept any account of it.”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes,” said Bart, “it has been blowing from the bows, and\r\nsometimes from the quarter.”\r\n\r\n“O, of course, and every other way,” said Arthur; “for the simple reason\r\nthat the ship must have been turning about, first one way and then the\r\nother, as she drifted.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a strong idea,” said Phil, “that this land is Newfoundland.”\r\n\r\n“O, no,” said Tom; “my impression is, that it’s Prince Edward’s Island.\r\nFor this to be Newfoundland, the wind should have been from the south\r\nor the south-west; but it seems to me that it has been generally from a\r\nnortherly direction.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think anything of the kind,” said Bart; “I think it’s been from\r\na westerly direction, and that this is some part of Nova Scotia or Cape\r\nBreton.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, an I agree with Tom,” said Pat, “about the wind, only I don’t\r\nthink that this is Prince Edward’s Island; it’s too high--so it is--and\r\nit’s meself that wouldn’t be a bit surprised if it should turrun out to\r\nbe the Magdalen Islands after all.”\r\n\r\n“O, no,” said Bruce, “it’s too long in extent for the Magdalen Islands.\r\nI think it may be some part of the New Brunswick coast, perhaps\r\nMiramichi,--for it seems to me that the wind has generally come from the\r\neast.”\r\n\r\n“So it seems to me,” said Arthur; “but, Bruce, an east wind couldn’t\r\ntake us to Miramichi; it would bring us a good distance to the north\r\nof that, from the place where we were. It seems to me that this must be\r\nGaspé,--and if so, we won’t be very far away from the Bay de Chaleur.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” cried Pat, with a laugh, “sure it’s the whole surroundin\r\ncoasts that we’ve gone over, so it is, an every one of us has put her\r\nin a different place from every one else. One comfort is, that some of\r\nus’ll have to be right, an so I’ll stick, so I will, to the Magdalen\r\nIslands, an if it is, why sure we’re certain of good intertainment, so\r\nwe are, ivery one of us.”\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said Bruce, cheerily, “perhaps, after all, this is about\r\nthe best thing that could have happened to us.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see why,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“Why, you know the very reason that Captain Corbet went away was to get\r\nsails to bring this ship to some land. The very thing we all wanted was\r\nto get her to some land. Well, here we’ve been drifting along, and now,\r\nlo and behold! here is the land that we wanted to reach.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but how can we get her to any port? We’ve got no sails, and we\r\ncan’t steer her.”\r\n\r\n“O, when we get nearer, some pilots or fishermen will come off.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but will they be salvors too?” asked Phil, anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” said Bruce, in a lofty tone; “they shall be nothing of\r\nthe kind. We’ll hire them to help us bring her into port. We’ll pay them\r\nliberally, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bart, “and we won’t let Captain Corbet’s absence make any\r\ndifference. He shall have his share all the same--for his not being here\r\nisn’t his fault.”\r\n\r\n“My idea is,” said Arthur, “that we’d better make a contribution, call\r\nit the Corbet Baby Fund, and add it to his share for the sake of old\r\ntimes, and all that sort of thing.”\r\n\r\n“Our profits,” Bruce went on to say, in the same lofty tone, “will\r\ndepend very largely upon the sort of place we can bring the ship to. If\r\nthis is Miramichi, they ought to be very large,--in fact, the ship’ll\r\nbring as large a price there as anywhere; but if it’s the Magdalen\r\nIslands, why, of course we can’t expect to do quite so well. Still we\r\nought to do well in almost any case.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to know how we can get word to Captain Corbet again,”\r\n said Arthur. “I’m afraid he’ll feel anxious about us.”\r\n\r\n“O, that’s easy enough,” said Bruce. “On landing, we can telegraph to\r\nthe Magdalen Islands, and they’ll get word to him somehow.”\r\n\r\n“But there isn’t any cable to the Magdalen Islands.”\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t the Newfoundland cable pass by there?”\r\n\r\n“O, no.”\r\n\r\n“O, well, we’ll telegraph to various places, and he’ll be sure to hear\r\nsooner or later.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder what’s become of him?” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“I dare say he’s cruising about the gulf everywhere, asking every vessel\r\nhe meets about us.”\r\n\r\n“I only hope, then, he’ll meet with more vessels than we have.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a very curious thing that we haven’t seen any vessels.”\r\n\r\n“O, I suppose we’ve drifted out of the way of the fishing vessels and\r\nthe timber ships. I dare say the fishing vessels keep generally to the\r\nsame places, for fishes must be more abundant in some spots than\r\nin others, and, as to the timber ships, they try to keep as much as\r\npossible in one given course.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder whether we’re drifting towards that land, or past it.”\r\n\r\n“O, well, we didn’t see it yesterday, and we do see it to-day, which\r\nproves that we have drifted towards it during the night; and from this\r\nit follows that we will be likely to continue drifting towards it. When\r\nwe get pretty close we must contrive to get some of the fishermen on\r\nthe coast to help us; but I don’t suppose there’ll be any trouble about\r\nthat. They’ll all come piling on board as soon as they catch sight of\r\nus, and see our situation.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder what sort of people they are,” said Phil. “Along some of\r\nthese shores they don’t bear the best of characters. Some of the fishing\r\npopulation are given to wrecking.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe a word of that,” said Bruce, “and I never did. I dare\r\nsay if a ship breaks up they appropriate what they can in a quiet way,\r\nand when the owners appear, they may be rather loath to surrender\r\ntheir spoil; but wrecking, in its bad sense, is not known here on these\r\nshores. Wrecking, as I understand it, means decoying vessels ashore, and\r\nsometimes murdering the shipwrecked crews. And I never heard of a case\r\nof that kind about these waters.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” suggested Bart, “they won’t feel inclined to recognize our\r\nownership. I confess I don’t feel myself a very strong confidence in our\r\nclaim.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“O, I don’t know. The claim don’t seem to be a just one; for instance,\r\nnow, if the owners were to appear in a steam-tug and hitch on, would you\r\norder them off?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I would,” said Bruce, firmly; “of course I would. I would hire\r\nthem to tow our ship and cargo into port, and pay them liberally, of\r\ncourse; but as to recognizing them as being owners, so long as we, the\r\nsalvors, were on board, I would do nothing of the kind. The moment the\r\ncaptain and crew deserted the Petrel, that moment they lost all claims\r\nto her, on their own account and on account of their employers. The\r\nowners after that must look to the insurance companies, while we gain\r\nthe benefits of good fortune and our own boldness.”\r\n\r\nBruce spoke all this in the most cool and confident manner in the world,\r\nand in the same tone as though the Petrel was lying in some safe harbor,\r\nand he and the boys were contemplating her, and considering her from\r\na cosy nook on the wharf. Yet all the time the ship was pitching, and\r\ntossing, and straining, and the waves boiled around, and the seas rolled\r\nin foam over her deck.\r\n\r\nThe conversation was at length interrupted by Solomon.\r\n\r\nHis head and shoulders were projecting from the skylight. He was\r\nstanding on the cabin table.\r\n\r\n“Ise ben a tryin, chilen,” said he, “an a deav-orin to git up some kine\r\nob a fire down heah, but I ben an made it six or seben times, an ebery\r\ntime de water hab stinguished it. Don know dat dar’s any sort o’ use in\r\ntryin to kin’l it agin, specially as all de kinlin wood’s used up, an\r\nde res ob it is soaked through an through. Pears to me we’ll hab to do\r\nwidout de tea an coffee, an drink cole water dis time, unless we can\r\nmanage to hist dis yer stove on deck. Only, if we do, it might turn out\r\nto be a leetle mite tottlish.”\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said Bart, “what do you say? Shall we try and get the\r\nstove on deck, or drink cold water?”\r\n\r\n“The stove on deck? O, nonsense!” said Arthur. “What’s the odds if we\r\ndon’t have tea and coffee? We’ve got enough to eat; we’ve got a precious\r\nsight better supply than we ever had on board the Antelope--cold boiled\r\nham, mustard, biscuit, butter, cheese, potted meats, and no end of\r\nthings. Bother the stove, I say. Let it slide. What do we want with it\r\nup here? We never could fix it in a tight place.”\r\n\r\nThis was the decision of all. In fact all saw that any attempt to hoist\r\nup the stove would have been absurd. The ship was pitching and tossing\r\ntoo much to make such a task practicable.\r\n\r\nSo Solomon came forth, having been driven from the cabin, as he had\r\nformerly been driven from the cook’s galley; but not for this did he\r\nlose any of his equanimity. He proceeded to lay out the breakfast as\r\nwell as he could upon the skylight, piling up the mattresses in a dry\r\nplace, and laying the table with a regard rather to use than to show.\r\nHe tacitly assumed that under the circumstances the breakfast would be\r\nsomewhat informal, and did not think it necessary to risk plates and\r\ncups by putting them where they would be certain to be flung off by\r\nthe motion of the ship. The table was therefore rudely spread, but the\r\neatables were all that could be desired.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the day went on, and the boys watched hour after hour\r\nthe distant shore. By midday it had grown much more distinct, and they\r\nknew that they were drawing nearer. A few hours after they had drawn\r\nstill nearer.\r\n\r\nBut the nearer they came the less satisfaction did they feel in the\r\naspect of the land. The most careful examination through the glass\r\nfailed to show the slightest sign of life. No houses appeared, no tilled\r\nfields, no pastures even, no clearings of any kind; but a rocky shore,\r\nwith a wooded country behind, was all that they could see.\r\n\r\n“O, well, boys,” said Bruce, “this is the way it is almost everywhere\r\naround these coasts; but I dare say Miramichi settlement is only a few\r\nmiles away, and we may find a fisherman’s hut in some cove close by.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n_A miserable Day.--Keeping their Courage up.--Solomon unmoved.--The\r\nCook triumphs over the Man.--A big Wave.--A\r\nShower-bath.--Helter-skelter.--All in a Heap.--Flight.--The\r\nRigging.--Solomon ventures his Life for a Ham Bone.--Remarks.--Flight\r\nfarther up.--The Mizzen-top.--The Fugitives.--Pat ties himself to\r\nthe Mast.--Remonstrances.--Pat is obdurate.--Night, and Storm, and\r\nDarkness._\r\n\r\n\r\nALL through that day the sea continued as rough as at first, and the\r\nwind blew as strongly. In the afternoon the wind came up more fiercely,\r\nand far surpassed anything they had experienced since they had boarded\r\nthe Petrel. It sang and roared through the rigging, and so great was\r\nits power, that there was a perceptible list in the ship in spite of\r\nthe tremendous weight of her cargo and water-logged hull. Soon the\r\nincreasing wind stirred up the sea to greater fury, and the ship began\r\nto labor most fearfully. Every hour made it worse; and at length the\r\nwhole ship forward seemed to be perpetually submerged, for nothing could\r\nbe seen of its deck, and the foaming waves rolled backward and forward,\r\nand boiled, and seethed, and swept resistlessly to and fro. Sometimes\r\na dozen huge waves in succession broke in thunder on the helpless ship\r\nwhich lay beneath them, and received these mountain torrents, quivering\r\nand groaning in every plank and beam.\r\n\r\nBy this time the boys had certainly become accustomed to the creaking\r\nand groaning of the straining ship, but this surpassed all that they\r\nhad yet seen, and filled them with awe. They stood there looking at the\r\nscene; the land was now forgotten. It had lost its interest. The feeling\r\nbegan to arise that perhaps they might never reach those shores, and if\r\nthey did turn a glance any longer in that direction, it was solely in\r\norder to measure the intervening distance, and try whether it might be\r\npossible for the ship to reach the shore before going to pieces.\r\n\r\nSolomon alone stood unmoved. Faithful to the last, with his one idea,\r\nthe performance of his duty, Solomon prepared the evening meal. The cook\r\ntriumphed over the man, and professional feeling rose superior to the\r\nfrailties of humanity. It was ham that they would have, and biscuit, and\r\nbutter. They should have cheese, too, and sardines. Pickles and mustard\r\nshould not be wanting. And Solomon laid these on the skylight, one by\r\none, solemnly and in silence, as though the consciousness was present in\r\nhis breast that this meal might be the last on board. Never before had\r\nhe arranged a repast more deliberately and more thoughtfully. The table\r\nwas set under circumstances which, indeed, required deliberation and\r\nthought. The pitching of the ship was so violent, that it required the\r\nmost careful management to induce the things to lie in their places;\r\nand it was only by covering the biscuit with bits of board, that he\r\nsucceeded in keeping them to their places. With the ham he had a long\r\nstruggle, but finally tied it with rope-yarn to the skylight. As to the\r\nsmaller articles, he had to leave them in the chest.\r\n\r\nSolomon was just returning for the last time, carrying a piece of cheese\r\nand a box of sardines; the boys were seated on the edge of the skylight,\r\nwaiting for the preparations to be completed, when suddenly the stern\r\nof the ship went down, down, down, very much farther than they had ever\r\nknown it to descend before. An awful thought seized upon all: the ship\r\nwas sinking! Every one started wildly up, clutching at anything that\r\nhappened to be nearest, without knowing what they were doing, and\r\nlooking fearfully through the opening at the end of their shelter.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrific sight that appeared in that direction.\r\n\r\nThere rose a wall of water, black, towering high in wrathful menace,\r\nwith its crest boiling in white foam. For a few moments that great\r\nmass hung poised above them; and then, with terrific fury, and with\r\nresistless might, it descended in thunder upon them. For a few moments\r\nall was the blackness of darkness, and the boys struggled despairingly\r\nwith the rolling, overwhelming, foaming waters, which swept them\r\nhelplessly about. The thought, and the only thought in every mind, was,\r\nthat the ship was going down, and with this conviction that the last\r\nhour of life had come, there rose from each a short prayer, gasped out\r\nin that moment of agony.\r\n\r\nIt seemed ages; but at length the ship slowly struggled up, and the\r\nwaters rolled away. For a few moments they all lay where they had been\r\nthrown, heaped up together; and then they struggled to their feet, and\r\neach began to call after the others. To their great joy they found that\r\nthey all were there, and that, except a few bruises more or less severe,\r\nno evil had been incurred. But the tarpaulins had been torn from the\r\nfastenings, and blown away by the fury of the wind, and the boys had\r\nbeen saved from a similar fate only by the quarter-deck rail, against\r\nwhich they had been flung. To this rail they clung as they rose to their\r\nfeet, and for a short time stood clinging there, not knowing what to do.\r\n\r\nBut from this stupor they were roused by the voice of Solomon.\r\n\r\n“Chilen,” said he, “de suppa am ’sposed of, an you got to go widout\r\nit dis bressed night. No use settin de table agin. Don’t pay in dis yer\r\nweather. Anybody dat wants anytin to eat, had bes go to de barl or de\r\ntrunk an fish for hisself. Dere all full ob salt water, and dem dat’s\r\nfond ob salt junk can get deir fill.”\r\n\r\nNone of the boys, however, showed any disposition to eat. This last\r\nwave had destroyed all appetite. It had showed them how the wind had\r\nincreased. They had hoped all along that the quarter-deck would be\r\nspared, and that they would be safe there; but now this hope was lost:\r\nwhere one wave had come, others were sure to follow, and the prospects\r\nfor the night were dark and dismal indeed. For the night was before\r\nthem. The sun was already going down; the sky looked lowering, and dark,\r\nand menacing; the wind had grown to a gale, and all around the waters\r\nseemed waiting to ingulf them. Once they had wondered why the captain\r\nand crew had fled from the ship; now they understood but too well the\r\nreason of that flight. The idea of salvage seemed now to all of them a\r\nmiserable mockery. What would they not have given to have escaped from\r\nthis ship to any place of safety? Even the days of famine on board the\r\nAntelope seemed less terrible than the fate that now frowned wrathfully\r\nupon them out of the lowering night.\r\n\r\n“It won’t do to stay here,” said Bruce. “Another wave’ll follow. Let’s\r\nget higher up, out of the way.”\r\n\r\n“Where can we go?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“Up in the rigging,” said Bruce. “Come.” Saying this, he climbed up the\r\nmizzen shrouds for a little distance on the windward side. The others\r\nfollowed. Last of all came Solomon, who took up his station below them\r\nall as though to guard them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0006]\r\n\r\nThere they all clung, and watched with awful eyes the scene below. It\r\nseemed for some time as though they had been premature in deserting\r\nthe quarter-deck, for no wave followed that mountain billow which had\r\nprecipitated itself upon them. But the recollection of that one wave was\r\nenough; and though its successor came not for some time, still they\r\nall confidently expected it. They knew that it would come before long,\r\nfollowed by many others, for the sea grew higher every minute, and the\r\nwrath of its waters grew more wild. Forward all was a sea of foam, and\r\nthe quarter-deck appeared beneath them like a raft over which they hung\r\nas they clung to the shrouds.\r\n\r\nThey did not climb far up. They were not more than ten feet above the\r\ndeck, having rested at this point, so that they might be out of the\r\nreach of the waves and no more. About their lost repast they did not\r\nthink for one moment. That wave which had swept away their supper, had\r\ncarried with it all thoughts and all desires concerning it. The only one\r\nwho gave it a thought was Solomon, who, even now, was still true to\r\nhis professional duties; and seeing the boiled ham lying against the\r\nquarter-deck railing, in the very place where it had been flung, he\r\nleaped down, at the peril of his life, hastily seized it, pitched it\r\ninto the trunk, and then clambered back again.\r\n\r\n“Boun to skewer dat ar ham dis yer time,” said he, in a soliloquizing\r\ntone. “No use lettin de win an de sea hab it all deir own way, nohow.\r\nDat ar ham’s too precious to be lost, an I’se boun to’ serve it up yet\r\nfor breakfus to-morrow, when de storm goes down. Lucky we didn’t try to\r\nhist up dat ar cabin stove. Jerusalem! wouldn’t it hab spun overboard?\r\nWould so. But it’s down deep ’nough now in de water, for de cabin’s\r\nchock full. Don’t ebber ’member bein so ’sturbed before in all my\r\ncookin ’sperience; an watebbers goin to be de suit ob it all’s more’n\r\nI can tell. Beats all; an dese yer chilen’s all boun to catch deir deff\r\nob cold.”\r\n\r\nAt this Solomon raised his head, and looked at each one of the boys in\r\nsuccession. He saw them all wet to the skin, with the water dripping\r\nfrom their clothes, and their hands clutching fast the rigging. It was a\r\npainful sight, too painful: he turned away his face, and drops of brine\r\nran down his face which did not come from the sea.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a thunderous sound arose, which made every one look in terror\r\ntowards the place from which it came. It was forward. In an instant they\r\nsaw it all. Several great waves had fallen there in swift succession,\r\nstriking amidships full upon a round-house which stood there, and was\r\nused for the reception of deck cargoes. The force of these blows was\r\nresistless; the structure yielded with a crash, and gave way utterly.\r\nFor a moment it was brought up against the ship’s bulwarks, but the\r\nwaters poured in underneath, floated it far upward, and tumbled it over\r\ninto the sea. There it floated at the mercy of the waves, farther and\r\nfarther away, while the raging billows, like hungry wolves, éncompassed\r\nit on every side.\r\n\r\nThe boys had already felt sufficiently awed by the scene around to be.\r\nhushed into silence, but about this last event there was something\r\nso appalling that they all uttered an involuntary cry, and clung more\r\nclosely to the rigging, each one looking at his neighbor with a face of\r\ndespair. For the only thought now present to each one was, that the ship\r\nwas breaking up, and that utter ruin and destruction was imminent. The\r\ncrash of the wave, as it struck the massive structure and tore it away,\r\nwas so tremendous that the boys might well have dreaded the worst; and\r\nthe sight of it now, as it tossed and tumbled in the boiling floods,\r\nhad in it something so terribly suggestive of their own fate, that they\r\nshuddered and turned their eyes away.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly Solomon’s voice broke the silence.\r\n\r\n“Dar,” said he; “dar’s how I knowed it was goin for to be. I bet high on\r\nde cook’s galley. Dem dar round-houses only built for show; dey got no\r\nrail strenf. Now de cook’s galley down dar ain’t goin to gib way dat\r\nfashium; she’s boun to stan, jes like de rock ob Gibberalter, an de\r\nstove too,--dat’s so.”\r\n\r\nThere was something in Solomon’s tone which was so cool and\r\nmatter-of-fact that the others felt a little reassured, and recovered\r\na little of their former coolness. They saw that the ship was still\r\nholding together, and as the waves rolled back, they saw the smooth\r\nfirm deck where the roundhouse had stood, and learned from this that the\r\nround-house did not constitute a portion of the ship, but was merely an\r\nerection on that deck, and therefore to some extent a movable.\r\n\r\nBut Solomon’s confidence in the cook’s galley was by no means warranted\r\nby facts. Thus far it had been protected to some extent from the sweep\r\nof the waves by the round-house, and the loss of this barrier left it\r\nall exposed to the full fury of the waters. For some time it bore up\r\ngallantly, and as each wave rolled over it, Solomon cheered exultantly,\r\nto see it come forth erect from the rolling torrents. At length,\r\nhowever, Solomon’s exultant cries grew fainter, and finally ceased\r\naltogether. For the galley was shaking, and quivering, and yielding.\r\nAt length one side started, and was beaten out; the rest soon followed,\r\nuntil all was crushed to fragments, and its separate portion hurled out\r\nupon the angry sea.\r\n\r\n“Anyhow,” said Solomon, “dat ar galley held out pooty tough, mind I tell\r\nyou; an dar’s de stove yet, as large as life, an it’s goin to take a\r\ngood many waves afore they’ll be able to start her. Yes, dat ar stove’s\r\ngoin to hold on, mind I tell you; an I’se a goin to bile a kittle ob\r\nwater on her yet, you see. Will so.”\r\n\r\nWhether Solomon really meant what he said, is an open question. He\r\nmay have really believed it all, or, as is most probable, he may have\r\nexpressed himself in this way merely for the purpose of giving courage\r\nand confidence to the boys, and preventing them from sinking into\r\ndespair. Certain it is that his words had this effect; and seeing that\r\nthe loss of the round-house and galley had made no material difference\r\nin the ship herself, they clung to hope, and tried to believe that the\r\nstout hull, with its firm cargo, would ride out the storm.\r\n\r\nBut by this time the sun had set; and now, in addition to their other\r\ntroubles, there was added the dismal prospect of the coming night. Dark,\r\nindeed, would that night be to all of them. Fearful enough was their\r\nposition already; but when, in addition to this, they would find the\r\nlight of day cut off, and the horror of great darkness all around, what\r\nsupport could they find for their sinking souls, or what hope of escape?\r\nAlready the land was fading out of sight, lost in the gathering shadows\r\nof evening. By the dim twilight they could see that they had drawn much\r\nnearer, and their distance seemed now but a few miles. Thus far they had\r\nregarded the land only with pleasure; now, however, as the night came\r\ndown, and the darkness deepened, and the storm increased, they began to\r\nexperience other feelings with regard to this dreary shore. That it was\r\nrocky and forbidding they had already seen, nor had they hitherto been\r\nable to detect any part of the coast here which was at all inviting or\r\nfavorable to a landing. If in such a storm the ship should be driven\r\nupon such a shore, what could save her from being shattered to pieces?\r\nIf in such a darkness they were driven upon those rocks, what could save\r\nthem from destruction? Yet towards that unknown shore they were every\r\nmoment drawing nearer, and wind and tide seemed alike to urge them\r\nonward towards it.\r\n\r\nIt was not yet dark, when suddenly a giant wave rose high from\r\nunderneath the stern, and hung suspended over the quarter-deck. It was\r\nthe counterpart of that wave which had struck them an hour before. For a\r\nfew moments it hung, poised and quivering, and then it fell, in thunder,\r\ndown. It poured all over the barrels of biscuit that were lashed to\r\nthe mizzen-mast, it swept down through the skylight into the cabin, it\r\nrolled in a flood over the deck, and rushed forward, pouring down, and\r\nblending its waters with those that boiled and foamed amidships.\r\n\r\nThe ship now seemed unable to rise. She seemed to have sunk into some\r\nvortex, and being without anything like buoyancy, the waters held her\r\nfast. Wave after wave rolled in, and poured over the quarter-deck. The\r\nwhole ship, from stem to stern, seemed to be one mass of foam. The hull\r\nwas lost to sight. They seemed supported by masts that rose out of the\r\nsea. Destruction appeared close at hand. Clinging to the rigging with\r\ndeath-like tenacity, they could only murmur their prayers of despair to\r\nthat mighty unseen Being who holds the waters in the hollow of his hand.\r\n\r\nAt length, shuddering, and groaning, and trembling in every fibre, like\r\nsome living thing, the ship struggled up out of the mass of waters,\r\nand freed herself for a time. The boys could see the quarter-deck.\r\nThey could see the barrels lashed to the mizzen-mast still secure.\r\nThey breathed more freely. It seemed as though they had received a\r\nreprieve,--as though their despairing cries had been heard and answered.\r\n\r\n“Boys,” said Bruce, “we can’t hang here all night. We’ll fall off. Lets\r\ngo up higher. There’s room for all of us, I think, in the mizzen-top.\r\nCome.”\r\n\r\nWith these words he started upward. The rest followed. Solomon went up\r\nlast. They all reached the mizzen-top in safety, and, on reaching it,\r\nfound that it was spacious enough to afford room for them all.\r\n\r\nHere Pat proceeded to possess himself of a line which ran through a\r\nblock close by, after which he began to tie himself to the mast.\r\n\r\n“What are you up to, Pat?” asked Bart, in some wonder.\r\n\r\n“Sure it’s tying meself to the mast, I am, so it is.”\r\n\r\n“Tying yourself to the mast?” repeated Bart, in amazement. “What in the\r\nworld is that for?”\r\n\r\n“What is it for?” said Pat. “Sure and what else is it that people always\r\ndo in shipwrecks? It’s the reg’lar thing, so it is.”\r\n\r\n“Well, for my part,” said Bart, “I’d rather have my hands free. If this\r\nmast should go over, I’d rather not be fastened to it as tight as that.\r\nYou’d better not.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an won’t I float ashore on it without any trouble?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; only the trouble may be to keep your head above water. Don’t do\r\nit, Pat.”\r\n\r\nBut Pat was deaf to argument. Slowly, but pertinaciously and securely,\r\nhe wound the rope round and round the mast, binding himself to it\r\ntighter at every turn.\r\n\r\n“Ye’d best follow my lade,” said Pat. “There’s enough left in this bit\r\nof a line to tie ye’s all fast and firrum, so there is.”\r\n\r\nBut the others refused. They preferred liberty of action, and did not\r\nlike the idea of swathing themselves up like mummies. They wished to be\r\nable occasionally, if possible, to lie down, or sit down, and not remain\r\nall night on their feet.\r\n\r\nThus there they stood in the mizzen-top. And the night came down, and\r\nthe darkness gathered deeper and deeper around them. And the storm rose\r\nto its height, and night, and storm, and darkness, in all their terrific\r\npower, environed them as they stood in their giddy perch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n_Night, and Storm, and Darkness.--The giddy Perch.--The trembling\r\nShip.--The quivering Masts.--A Time of Terror.--Silence and\r\nDespair.--A Ray of Hope.--Subsidence of Wind ami Wave.--Descent of the\r\nBoys.--Sufferings of Pat.--In the Mizzen-top.--Vigil of Bart.--The Sound\r\nof the Surf.--The Rift in the Cloud.--Land near.--The white Line of\r\nBreakers.--The black Face of Solomon.--All explained.--The Boat and the\r\nOars.--The friendly Cove.--Land at last._\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHT, and storm, and darkness! There, in their giddy perch in the\r\nmizzen-top, stood that despairing little band. Gradually all the scene\r\nwas lost to view in thick darkness. But beneath, the ship tossed and\r\npitched wildly, groaning and creaking as before, and the big waves beat\r\nin fury on her bows, or fell in thunder on her quarter-deck. Looking\r\ndown, they saw the phosphorescent gleam of the boiling waters, which\r\nmade all the extent of the ship luminous with a baleful lustre, and wide\r\nover the seas extended the same glow. Well it was for them that they had\r\nsought this place of retreat, or rather that this place of retreat had\r\nbeen left open to them, for clinging to the rigging would have exhausted\r\ntheir strength, and through those long hours more than one might have\r\nfallen into the sea. But as it was they could have something like rest,\r\nand, by changing their positions, find relief for their wearied frames.\r\n\r\nYet this place had its own terrors, which were fully equal to any\r\nothers. The wind howled fearfully through the rigging, and as the ship\r\npitched and tossed, the mast strained and quivered in unison. Often and\r\noften it seemed to them that the strained mast would suddenly snap and\r\ngo over the side, or, if not, that in its violent jerks it might hurl\r\nthem all over to destruction. More than once they thought of guarding\r\nagainst this last danger by following Pat’s example, and binding\r\nthemselves to the rigging; but they were deterred from this by the\r\nfear of the mast falling, in which case they, too, would be helpless.\r\nFortunate it was for them that there were no sails. These had long since\r\nbeen rent away; but had they been here now, or had the wind taken any\r\nstronger hold of the masts, they must have gone by the board.\r\n\r\nOften and often, as some larger wave than usual struck the ship, the\r\nfeeling came that all was over, and that now, at last, her break-up was\r\nbeginning; often and often, as she sank far down, and the waters rolled\r\nover her quarter, and held her there, the fear came to them that at last\r\nher hour had come--that she was sinking; and with this fear they looked\r\ndown, expecting to see the waters rise to where they were standing.\r\nAnd then, in every one of these moments of deadly fear, they raised, as\r\nbefore, their cries to Him who is able to save.\r\n\r\nSo passed away hour after hour, until the duration of time seemed\r\nendless, and it was to all of them as though they had spent days in\r\ntheir place of peril, instead of hours only.\r\n\r\nAt length they became sensible of a diminution in the power of the wind.\r\nAt first they hardly dared to believe it, but after a time it became\r\nfully evident that such was the case. The cessation of the wind at once\r\nrelieved the ship very materially, though the sea was still high, and\r\nthe waters below relaxed but little from their rage. But the cessation\r\nof the wind filled them all with hope, and they now awaited, with\r\nsomething like firmness, the subsidence of the waves.\r\n\r\nThat subsidence did come, and was gradually evident. It was slow, yet\r\nit was perceptible. They first became aware that those giant waves\r\nno longer fell in thunder upon the quarter-deck, and that the ship no\r\nlonger seemed to be dragged down into those deep, watery abysses into\r\nwhich they had formerly seemed to be descending.\r\n\r\n“There’s no mistake about it, boys,” said Bruce at length, in tones that\r\nwere tremulous with fervent joy; “the storm is going down.”\r\n\r\nThis was the first word that had been spoken for hours, and the sound\r\nof these spoken words itself brought joy to all hearts. The spell was\r\nbroken. The horror vanished utterly from their souls.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” cried Bart, in tones as tremulous as those of Bruce, and from the\r\nsame cause,--“yes, the worst is over!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t mind this pitching,” said Tom; “it seems familiar. I think\r\nto-night has been equal to my night in the Bay of Fundy--only it hasn’t\r\nbeen so long, and it’s seemed better to have you fellows with me than\r\nbeing alone.”\r\n\r\n“I had a hard time in the woods,” said Phil, “but this has been quite\r\nequal to it.”\r\n\r\n“Pat,” said Arthur, “you’ve been doing the mummy long enough. You’d\r\nbetter untie now, and lie down.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s meself that’ll be the proud lad to do that same,” said\r\nPat, “for it’s fairly achin I am all over, so it is.”\r\n\r\nWith these words Pat tried to unbind himself. But this was not so easy.\r\nHe had been leaning his whole weight against the ropes, and his hands\r\nwere quite numb. The other boys had to help him. This was a work of\r\nsome difficulty, but it was accomplished at last, and poor Pat sank down\r\ngroaning, and he never ceased to sigh and groan till morning.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours now passed. The sea subsided steadily, until at length\r\nits motion was comparatively trifling, not more than enough to cause a\r\nperpendicular pitch to the ship of a few feet, and to send a few waves\r\noccasionally over the deck. Wearied and worn out, the boys determined to\r\ndescend to the quarter-deck, so as to lie down. Pat was unable to make\r\nthe descent; so Bart remained with him, and curled himself up alongside\r\nof him on the mizzen-top. The other boys went down, and Solomon also.\r\n\r\nEverything there was wet, but as the boys also were saturated, it made\r\nbut little difference. They flung themselves down anywhere, and soon\r\nwere fast asleep.\r\n\r\nBut in the main-top Pat was groaning in his pain. The blood was rushing\r\nback into his benumbed limbs, and causing exquisite suffering. Bart\r\ntried to soothe him, and rubbed and chafed his arms and hands and feet\r\nand legs for hours.\r\n\r\nAt last Pat grew easier, though still suffering somewhat from pricking\r\nsensations in his arms and legs, and Bart was allowed to rest from his\r\nlabors.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as Bart leaned back, he became aware of a very peculiar sound,\r\nwhich excited all his attention.\r\n\r\nIt was a droning sound, with a deep, swelling cadence, and not long in\r\nduration; but it rose, and pealed forth, and died away, to be followed\r\nby other sounds precisely similar--regular, recurrent, and sounding all\r\nabroad. It was nothing like the roar of the waves, nor the singing of\r\nthe wind through the rigging; it was something different from these, yet\r\nin this darkness, and to this listener, not less terrible.\r\n\r\nBart knew it. The sound was familiar to his ears. There was only one\r\nsound in Nature of that character, nor could it be imitated by any\r\nother. It was the long sound of the surf falling upon the shore.\r\n\r\nThe surf!\r\n\r\nWhat did that mean?\r\n\r\nIt meant that land was near. And what land?\r\n\r\nThere was only one land that this could tell of--it was that land which\r\nthey had been approaching for days; the land which they had watched\r\nso closely all the previous day, and to which at evening they had been\r\ndrawn so near. The name of the land he could not know, but he had seen\r\nit, and he remembered its drear and desolate aspect, its iron-bound\r\nshores, its desert forests. It was upon this shore that the surf was\r\nbeating which now he heard, and the loudness of that sound told him how\r\nnear it must be.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him that it could not be more than half a mile away at the\r\nfarthest.\r\n\r\nAnd the ship was drifting on!\r\n\r\nThis first discovery was a renewal of his despair. He could only find\r\ncomfort in the thought that the sea had subsided so greatly. What ought\r\nhe now to do?\r\n\r\nOught he to awake the boys and tell them? He hesitated.\r\n\r\nPat had by this time fallen asleep, worn out with weariness and pain.\r\nBart had not the heart to wake him just yet.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was an opening in the sky overhead, and through a rift in\r\nthe clouds the moon beamed forth. Bart started up and looked all around.\r\nThe morn disclosed the scene.\r\n\r\nThe sea had grown much calmer, and the waves that now tossed about their\r\nspray over its surface were as nothing compared to those which had beat\r\nupon the ship during the night. This was probably due, as Bart thought,\r\nto the shelter of some headland which acted as a breakwater. For as he\r\nlooked he saw the land now full before him. He had conjectured rightly\r\nfrom the sound of the surf, and he now saw that this land could not be\r\nmuch more than a half mile away.\r\n\r\nThis confirmation of his worst fears overcame him. He started to his\r\nfeet, and stood clinging to the rigging, and looking at the land.\r\n\r\nHow near! how fearfully near! And every moment was drawing the ship\r\nnearer. And what sort of a shore was that? Was it all rocky, or was it\r\nsmooth sand? The waves were high enough there to create a tremendous\r\nsurf. Did that surf fall on breakers, or did it fall on some gentle\r\nbeach? This he could not tell. In vain he strained his eyes. He could\r\nsee the white line of foaming surf, and beyond this the dark hills, or\r\ncliffs, but more than this he could make out nothing definite. But the\r\nshore was so near that their fate could not be very long delayed, and\r\nhe determined to wake the boys at once, leaving Pat to sleep a little\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nWith this intention he prepared to descend. But scarce had he put one\r\nfoot over, when he saw a shadowy figure close by.\r\n\r\n“Mas’r Bart,” said a voice.\r\n\r\nIt was Solomon.\r\n\r\n“I see you a movin about, an I jes thought I’d come up to see how you\r\nwas a gittin along,” said Solomon.\r\n\r\n“Did you see the land?” asked Bart, in agitated tones.\r\n\r\n“De lan! Sartin sure--seen it dese four hours. Ben a watchin it ebber so\r\nlong.”\r\n\r\n“What! Why didn’t you wake us before?”\r\n\r\n“Wake you? Not me. What de use ob dat ar? I ben kine o’ watchin, an kine\r\no’ canterin round all de time, seein dat de tings are all straight; an\r\nI got de galley stove in prime order, an if youns don’t get de bes\r\nbreakfas you ebber eat, den I’m a useless ole nigga. Sho, now; go away.\r\nLeab tings to me, I tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Breakfast!” cried Bart, in amazement. “Why, we’ll drift ashore in a few\r\nminutes. Don’t you see how near we are? What shall we do? Is the boat\r\ngone?”\r\n\r\nSolomon put his head back for a few minutes, and chuckled to himself in\r\na kind of ecstasy.\r\n\r\n“De boat? O, yes, de boat’s all right. Held on tight as a drum--de boat\r\nan de galley stove.”\r\n\r\n“O, then,” said Bart, “come, let’s wake the boys, and get her out at\r\nonce. It isn’t too rough for her here. We must get some pieces of wood\r\nfor paddles.”\r\n\r\n“O, dere’s lashins ob time; neber you mind,” said Solomon. “You jes lie\r\ndown an finish your nap, an leab de res to me.”\r\n\r\n“But we’re drifting ashore. In a quarter of an hour we’ll be among the\r\nbreakers.”\r\n\r\n“O, no, Mas’r Bart; not in a good many quarter ob an hours.”\r\n\r\n“But the shore’s only half a mile away.”\r\n\r\n“I know it,” said Solomon; “an it’s ben jes dat, ar distums off for de\r\nlas four hour an more.”\r\n\r\n“What!”\r\n\r\n“Dat’s so. I ben a watchin. Hadn’t I tole you dat ar?”\r\n\r\n“But the ship’s afloat. She isn’t aground. She must be drifting in.”\r\n\r\n“Dat ar conclusium don’t foller as a nessary suc-cumstance,” said\r\nSolomon, with dignity.\r\n\r\n“Why, what prevents her from drifting?” asked Bart, in a puzzle..\r\n\r\n“De simplest ting in de world,” said Solomon--“her anchor.”\r\n\r\n“Her anchor! O,” cried Bart, as a flood of light burst in upon his mind,\r\nand dispelled all the darkness of his despair; “her anchor! O, I begin\r\nto understand.”\r\n\r\n“Tell you what,” said Solomon; “when I fust heard dat ar surf I was in a\r\nquandary, mind I tell you. Gib all up. Was jes about to rouse youns.\r\nBut fust an foremost I went to see about de boat. Found dat all right\r\nan tight. Den I got a belayum pin an tored off some strips ob wood for\r\npaddles. Den I waited to see how we was a goin. Well, arter waitin for\r\nebber so long, de surf didn’t get any nearer. Tell you what; dat ar\r\nsuccumstance puzzled dis old nigga’s head considdable. Sudden a idee\r\npopped into me. I ran forad, an sure enough I found de ship’s head off\r\nfrom de sho, an felt de anchor chain standin out stiff. Den I knew\r\nde anchor had caught, and had fetched her up all right in dis yer\r\nidenticull place an po--sitium; an so, Mas’r Bart, here we air, anchored\r\nhard an fast, de boat all right an tight, de paddles ready, de galley\r\nstove ready too, an de prospek afore all ob us ob a fus’-rate breakfas\r\nto ward us for all de per’ls an clamties ob de night.”\r\n\r\nSome further inquiries followed from Bart, which served to assure him\r\nstill more of Solomon’s vigilance; and the result was, that after a time\r\nhe resumed his place beside Pat in the mizzen-top, and, curling himself\r\nup, was soon sound asleep. It was not a very luxurious sleeping-place,\r\nbut it was at least as soft as the deck below, where the boys had flung\r\nthemselves, and it was also a trifle dryer.\r\n\r\nWhen Bart awoke it was broad day. Pat was gone. He had awaked, and,\r\nfinding himself all right again, and seeing the land close by, he had\r\ndescended to the deck to talk to Solomon. For his first thought had been\r\na very natural one, namely, that the ship was going ashore; and seeing\r\nSolomon placidly moving about below, he had gone down to find out what\r\nit all meant. Of course his fears were soon dispelled.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the boys waked at about the same time that Bart did, and he\r\nsoon rejoined them below. The smell of broiled ham was wafted over the\r\nship. Great was the wonder of Bruce, Arthur, Tom, and Phil at their\r\npresent situation, and even greater was their wonder at seeing the\r\nrepast which Solomon had already spread out upon the quarter-deck.\r\n\r\nFor Solomon had been working like a beaver.\r\n\r\nHe had forced open the cabin door, and let out all the water. He had\r\nthen obtained some coal, which, though wet, burned merrily in the galley\r\nstove, and had found the cooking utensils, which he had fortunately\r\nconveyed to the cabin when he had first been driven from the galley.\r\n\r\nThe biscuit were, of course, soaked and saturated with salt water; but\r\nSolomon declared that they were made to be soaked before cooking, and\r\nthat the salt water was “jes as good as fresh--ebry mite.” So he fried\r\nthese in butter, and sprinkled over them some pepper, which was in the\r\nsea-chest, and which, with all the other contents of the chest, had not\r\nbeen injured. Ham, and toasted cheese, and potted meats, and tea and\r\ncoffee, together with other articles too numerous to mention, formed\r\nthe breakfast; and it is scarce necessary to say that the boys did full\r\njustice to it.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast they began to consider what next they should do. The\r\nland was close by, about half a mile away. The line of coast extended\r\nfar away towards the left, but on the right it ended in a headland. The\r\nsea was very quiet, but on the shore before them there was a heavy surf,\r\nthe result of the past storm. They saw farther away to the left a smooth\r\nbeach, where a landing might be easily effected, and another place\r\ntowards the right where there was very little surf. This last seemed the\r\nbest place for attempting a landing.\r\n\r\nThe shore was not very attractive. In some places rocky cliffs arose,\r\ncrowned at the summit with spruce and birch; in other places there were\r\nslopes covered with the same sort of trees. There was no sign whatever\r\nof any house, or of any cultivation, or of any pasture land, or of any\r\nclearing. The forest seemed unbroken.\r\n\r\nThe boys were now as ignorant of the country as they had been when they\r\nfirst saw it. Each still held the same opinion which he had announced\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nPhil thought that it was Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nTom, that it was Prince Edward’s Island.\r\n\r\nBart, that it was some part of Nova Scotia, or Cape Breton.\r\n\r\nPat, that it was the Magdalen Islands.\r\n\r\nBruce, that it was the coast of New Brunswick, somewhere near the\r\nMiramichi.\r\n\r\nAnd Arthur, that it was Gaspé, not far from the Bay de Chaleur.\r\n\r\nThus, although this particular spot seemed desolate enough, no one gave\r\nany thought to that, for they all supposed that inhabitants could be\r\nfound within no very great distance. .\r\n\r\nAfter some deliberation, it was at length concluded to go ashore.\r\nThe strips of wood which Solomon had already, with wise forethought,\r\nprocured, were easily shaped into very respectable paddles by means of a\r\nhatchet and a knife.\r\n\r\nThey then determined to secure themselves from want while ashore, and\r\nthis they did by putting into the boat one of the barrels of biscuit and\r\nthe chest of provisions.\r\n\r\nThen they all embarked and pulled away. They paddled along without\r\ndifficulty towards the beach on the right, where the surf seemed less.\r\nOn approaching this, they found a cove formed by a gully among the\r\nhills, and at one end there were grassy banks, near which a stream of\r\nfresh water flowed into the sea.\r\n\r\nHere they landed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\n_The Lookout over the Sea.--The missing Ship.--Where are the\r\nBoys?--Where are the Boys?--Where are the Boys?--Where are the\r\nBoys?--Where are the Boys?--Where are the Boys?--An elaborate\r\nCalculation.--Dragging the Anchor.--A Chart on the Cabin Table.--Writ\r\nin Water.--Hope.--The Antelope sails ‘North by East.--Corbet watches the\r\nHorizon.--Midday.--Despair.--Corbet crushed!_\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet had arrived at the place where he supposed he had left\r\nthe Petrel, and on looking about saw no signs of her, he was filled with\r\ndespair. The wind had been blowing all night long, and the sea had been\r\nrising to an extent that might have justified the deepest anxiety; he\r\nhad been upheld only by the thought that he was bringing relief to the\r\nboys; and this solitary consolation was taken from him by the first\r\nglance that he cast around.\r\n\r\nThis was the fifth day since he had left them. He had gone, proposing\r\nand expecting to be back in two days, or in three at farthest. But he\r\nhad gone much farther than he had at first intended, and hence had left\r\nthem longer than he had said.\r\n\r\nAnd where were they now?\r\n\r\nIn vain he strained his eyes. The only sail on the water was that\r\nschooner: possibly some fisherman cruising about in this direction.\r\n\r\nWhere were the boys?\r\n\r\nWhere were the boys that had been committed to his care,--the boys who\r\nhad been intrusted to him,--the boys who had confided in him,--the boys\r\nwho had placed their young lives in his keeping?\r\n\r\nWhere were the boys?\r\n\r\nWhere were the boys whom he had left; whom he had promised to return for\r\nso promptly?\r\n\r\nHe had led them into difficulty, and left them there!\r\n\r\nHe had led them into starvation--that was his first fault. How they had\r\nsuffered during those days of calm! He had led them to that waterlogged\r\nvessel! He had gone on board with them; he had caused them to put a\r\nconfidence in that wrecked ship which was not justifiable.\r\n\r\nWorst of all, he had left them!\r\n\r\nAnd now that he thought of it, what was that ship? She might have been\r\nnot water-logged--but sinking! The thought filled him with horror. A\r\nsinking ship! and he had left them there!\r\n\r\nNo; she was not a sinking ship--he knew that.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the length of time that he had seen her from a distance.\r\nHe recalled the time he had been on board, and all the observations\r\nwhich he had made. Water-logged she certainly was, but not sinking--no,\r\nnot sinking. Timber ships never sink. They cannot sink. A timber ship\r\nis like a solid wooden ship low down in the water, but absolutely\r\nunsinkable.\r\n\r\nThis thought brought some consolation to him in his despair.\r\n\r\nBut as he looked out over the sea, as he saw the swelling waves, as he\r\nfelt the Antelope toss, and leap, and plunge about, and as he recalled\r\nthe long night that had passed, with its storms and billows, he trembled\r\nfor the boys in the water-logged ship.\r\n\r\nAnd again the old question came back,--\r\n\r\nWhere were the boys?\r\n\r\nWhere were the boys whom he had left in the water-logged ship? He\r\nhimself had anchored that ship in these waters, hard and fast; but now,\r\nas he looked about far over the seas, he saw no sign of any ship, or\r\nof any floating thing save that distant fishing schooner. What did this\r\nmean?\r\n\r\nAgain and again he asked this question, and again and again he shrank\r\nback from the answer that suggested itself.\r\n\r\nHe tried to console himself by thinking of the buoyancy of wood in\r\ngeneral, and of timber ships in particular. Alas! these efforts were all\r\nin vain. For he remembered how rough the sea had been; and he saw all\r\naround him even now the swelling waves. That ship had already been torn\r\nand shattered by storms. That ship had been forsaken by captain and\r\ncrew. They had believed that she was about to founder. Was this belief,\r\nthen, so far wrong as he had supposed? She was like a raft, torn and\r\ndislocated, which any fresh movement of the water might shatter to\r\npieces. Perhaps in the storm that had fallen upon her in his absence\r\nthe waves had wrought their will upon her. Perhaps they had torn her\r\nto pieces in their wrath, and scattered all her timbers afar over the\r\nsurface of the deep. Perhaps the only vestige of the Petrel which his\r\neyes might ever see, might be some floating timbers drifting past, and\r\nbearing to him the only message which could ever come to the land of the\r\nliving from the lost boys.\r\n\r\nWhere were the boys?\r\n\r\nWhere, O, where were the boys whom he had led into danger, and then\r\nmadly deserted?--doubly deserted, in fact; first, when he sailed away,\r\nleaving them on board the wrecked ship, and secondly, in that worse\r\ndesertion, when he had gone away so thoughtlessly, so wickedly, and so\r\nmadly, from the Magdalen Islands to the Miramichi River? How could he\r\nhave ever thought of it? What could have so infatuated him as to lead\r\nhim so far away from those helpless boys in their desperate position?\r\n\r\nWhere were the boys?\r\n\r\nO, where were the boys? And what had they thought of him? What misery\r\nhad they not suffered! What despair! How often must they have watched\r\nfor his return! And day had succeeded to day, and night to night, but\r\nhe had never come! While they were watching for his appearance, he was\r\ncalmly sailing away, or was loitering in distant ports, leaving them to\r\ntheir terrific fate!\r\n\r\nWhere were the boys?\r\n\r\nWhat was their fate?\r\n\r\nWhat had become of that ship?\r\n\r\nShe had been anchored fast. She was gone now. Gone! Gone were those\r\nboys, for whom he would have laid down his life; but whom, nevertheless,\r\nhe had deserted and betrayed. And he--what could he do? Where could he\r\ngo? Where could he search for them? Over what seas could he sail? With\r\nwhat hope? Was there any hope? Hope! Alas! what hope could he form when\r\nhe looked out over these foaming waves, and felt the Antelope quiver\r\nbeneath the force of their assault?\r\n\r\nThese, or something very much like these, were the thoughts that\r\nfilled the soul of the unhappy, the despairing Corbet, as he rolled his\r\nvenerable eyes over the wide waste of waters, and saw that the Petrel\r\nwas gone. It was a moment full of deeper misery and keener anguish than\r\nany which the good captain had ever known in the whole course of his\r\nlife, though that life had by no means been without its sufferings. Yet\r\namong all the sufferings and sorrows of a life full of vicissitudes, it\r\nhad never fallen to his lot to experience such a misfortune as this,--to\r\nreproach himself so keenly, so severely, and yet so justly. Whatever the\r\nfate of the boys might have been, he knew perfectly well that he, and\r\nhe alone, was the cause; nor could he plead, even to his own conscience,\r\nthe excuse that his motives were right. For his motives were not right,\r\nand he knew it. His motives had been nothing better than wild desires\r\nfor sudden wealth. True, he had only wished that wealth for his\r\n“babby;” but that did not in the least mitigate his offence. At the very\r\nleast, he had been guilty of carelessness so gross that it was hardly\r\ninferior to downright, deliberate crime.\r\n\r\nSo the poor captain’s anguish of soul was extreme, and utter, as well it\r\nmight be. So keen, indeed, was his suffering, that his hair might have\r\nturned white from its severity,--a circumstance not unusual,--but in the\r\ncaptain’s case it was not possible, since, as is well known, his hair\r\nwas already as gray as it well could be, and therefore the good Captain\r\nCorbet could only suffer in secret, and occasionally wipe away the tears\r\nthat dropped from his eyes with the sleeve of his venerable coat.\r\n\r\nAt length the thought occurred to him that perhaps he had not come to\r\nthe right place.\r\n\r\nTo his mind, the thought was well nigh inconceivable; yet, after all, it\r\nwas barely possible, and in his despair he caught at this straw. After\r\nall, navigation by dead reckoning is not the most accurate way in the\r\nworld of working one’s way along; and Captain Corbet felt this in an\r\nobscure and shadowy sort of way; so it need not be wondered at if he\r\nsought relief in the thought that he had possibly gone astray.\r\n\r\nSo he called upon Wade to take the helm, while he went below to make\r\nsome elaborate calculations.\r\n\r\nHe did it in this way.\r\n\r\nHe first got a mug of water.\r\n\r\nThen he seated himself by the cabin table.\r\n\r\nThen he dipped the fore finger of his right hand in the water.\r\n\r\nThen, with this finger, he traced certain mysterious marks upon the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nNow, these mysterious marks were designed by this ancient mariner to\r\nrepresent nothing less than the coasts surrounding the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence. To an unprejudiced observer, this idea would never have\r\nsuggested itself; but to the mind of the venerable Corbet, these\r\nmarks were as plain and as intelligible as the finest outlines of the\r\nAdmiralty charts engraved in steel, and bristling with names of places.\r\nIn his mind’s eye he could see everything. He could see Prince Edward’s\r\nIsland, Cape Breton, Newfoundland, Gaspé, the Bay de Chaleur, Miramichi,\r\nand the Magdalen Islands. There, too, full and fair, in the centre of\r\nthe scene, a big wet spot, made most emphatically with his thumb, showed\r\nhim the spot where he had left the Petrel.\r\n\r\nAnd this was Captain Corbet’s chart, and this was his mode of\r\nnavigating, and this was the scientific method which he adopted in\r\norder to work his way out of a difficulty. Quadrant, sextant, and other\r\ninstruments of that character he did not need; he trusted to his own\r\nhead, and to his finger.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that, on this occasion, these resources rather\r\nfailed him. The puzzle seemed insoluble. In vain he obliterated the wet\r\nspot where he first stationed the Petrel. In vain he made another dab\r\nwith his thumb in a second place. He could not arrive at any conclusion\r\nwhich was entirely satisfactory. He placed the mug of water on the\r\ntable, leaned his aged head in both hands, and sat watching his chart\r\nin profound thought. A sudden sea struck the Antelope. The good vessel\r\nleaped, as was natural, at such rough treatment. As was natural, also,\r\nthe mug of water leaped. Moreover, it upset. The contents poured forth,\r\nand inundated the fable. The chart was all obliterated.\r\n\r\nAt this casualty Captain Corbet rose. He betrayed no excitement, no\r\npassion. He did not swear, as some wrecked sea captains have done. He\r\ndid not even utter an exclamation. He simply took his aged coat tail and\r\nwiped the water off the table very carefully, and then with his other\r\naged coat tail he dried it, and even polished it most elaborately. The\r\ntable had not been so clean for ever so long. It seemed to be astonished\r\nat itself. Captain Corbet, meanwhile, remained mild and patient. Sir\r\nIsaac Newton himself, after the burning of his Principia by his immortal\r\nlittle dog Diamond, was not more placid. Without a word, our captain\r\nwent to the bucket, replenished the mug, returned to the table, resumed\r\nhis seat, and, holding the mug in his left hand, under the table, to\r\nprevent a recurrence of this mishap, he dipped the fore finger of his\r\nright hand into the water, and proceeded to retrace upon the table the\r\noutline of his chart. In a little while there appeared before his eyes,\r\nas plain as before, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with all the surrounding\r\ncoasts--Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Gaspé, Newfoundland,\r\nthe Magdalen Islands, and plain in the middle the dab of his venerable\r\nthumb representing the spot where he had left the Petrel.\r\n\r\nBut the problem remained insoluble. He was certain that he had come back\r\nto the right spot. Again and again he traced, in a thin line, made by\r\nhis wet finger-nail, the course which he had taken; first, from the\r\nPetrel to the Magdalen Islands, and, secondly, from the Magdalen Islands\r\nto Miramichi, and, thirdly, from Miramichi to the place where he now\r\nwas. In each case his course had, fortunately, been quite straight. Had\r\nthere been head winds, it might have been different; but, as it was, the\r\nstraight course which he had kept made the outlines on the table all\r\nthe more simple, but at the same time they made the problem all the more\r\ncomplex. The ship was missing. He had left her at anchor. She could not\r\nsink. What, then, had become of her?\r\n\r\nThe first answer was the terrible one that she had gone to pieces in the\r\nstorm. But this was the very one from which he was seeking to escape,\r\nand against which he sought refuge in such facts as her strength and the\r\nstiffness of a timber cargo.\r\n\r\nBut what other conclusion was there?\r\n\r\nThat he had mistaken his way?\r\n\r\nImpossible!\r\n\r\nOn the table before him the marks that he had made confirmed him in the\r\nopinion that he was, if not on the identical spot where he had left the\r\nPetrel, at least sufficiently near to be able to see her if she still\r\nwas here.\r\n\r\nYet here she evidently was not.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, had become of her?\r\n\r\nTo this only one answer remained, and in this he sought to find comfort.\r\n\r\nShe might have dragged her anchor, and might have thereby drifted, under\r\nthe pressure of the storm, far enough away to be out of sight.\r\n\r\nBut in what direction had she drifted?\r\n\r\nThe wind had been south by east. He knew that well enough. This one\r\nfact, then, showed him what course she would have taken when adrift. .\r\n\r\nHe wet his finger now for the last time. He planted it down upon the\r\nplace which he had marked as the position of the Petrel, and then drew a\r\nline in the direction which he supposed might indicate the course of\r\nher drift. Then he stopped to calculate the possible distance which\r\nshe might have traversed while dragging her anchor, and made a mark to\r\nrepresent what, under this theory, might be her present position.\r\n\r\nThen he drew a long breath.\r\n\r\nHe then rose to his feet, and surveyed his chart for a few moments with\r\na thoughtful face.\r\n\r\nAnd now the time had come for action. He had at last a theory. His mind\r\nwas made up. He hurried upon deck, and, seizing the tiller, headed\r\nthe Antelope north by west, in the direction which he conjectured the\r\ndrifting ship to have taken.\r\n\r\nHe had allowed between twenty and thirty miles for her drift. He had\r\ncalculated that a mile an hour would be a fair allowance for a vessel\r\nthat was dragging her anchor, and he did not think that the wind had\r\nbeen strong enough to make her drag her anchor for more than twenty\r\nhours, and certainly, as he thought, not more than thirty, at the\r\nfarthest. Upon this principle he acted, and when he headed the Antelope\r\nnorth by west, he hoped to catch sight of the lost ship before noon.\r\n\r\nFor the Antelope, with a fair wind, could make as much as four or five\r\nmiles an hour; and, after making every allowance for currents, or for\r\nleeway, she ought to do twenty miles between six o’clock in the morning\r\nand midday. And so, full of confidence in the ability of the Antelope to\r\ndo her duty, Captain Corbet took his station at the helm.\r\n\r\nNow that a gleam of hope had appeared, he was a different man. The\r\ngleam became brighter and brighter, until at last it grew to be positive\r\nsunshine. He forgot his recent despair. The more he thought of his\r\ntheory of the Petrel dragging her anchor, the more convinced he was that\r\nit was correct, and the more certain he was that he would ultimately\r\ncatch sight of her.\r\n\r\nAnd so he kept on his course, with his eyes fixed on the horizon before\r\nhim, anxiously awaiting the time when he would descry the masts of the\r\nlost vessel becoming gradually defined against the sky.\r\n\r\nHour after hour passed.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope sailed on.\r\n\r\nMidday came.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope had traversed the distance which her commander had allotted\r\nfor the utmost possible drift of the Petrel.\r\n\r\nYet not the slightest sign of the Petrel had appeared.\r\n\r\nThe hopes upon which Captain Corbet had been relying gradually sank\r\nunder him. When midday came, and the masts of the Petrel did not\r\nappear, hope sank away, and despondency came, and despondency deepened\r\ninto despair.\r\n\r\nAll that he had felt at early dawn, when he first looked abroad upon the\r\nseas and found her not, now came back to him,--all the self-reproach,\r\nall the remorse, all the anguish of soul.\r\n\r\nHe stood at the helm, and let the Antelope pass onward, but there was\r\nno longer any hope in his mind. He was overwhelmed, and now even the\r\npossibility of finding her seemed to be taken away.\r\n\r\nAll this time the wind had gone on increasing in violence, and the sea\r\nhad risen more and more. For himself and for the Antelope Captain Corbet\r\ndid not care; but the lowery sky and the stormy sea seemed terrible to\r\nhim, for they spoke to him of the lost boys, and told a tale of horror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\n_The venerable but very unfortunate, Corbet--The Antelope lies\r\nto.--Emotions of her despairing Commander.--Night and Morning.--The\r\nFishing Schooner,--An old Acquaintance appears, and puts the old, old\r\nQuestion.--Corbet overwhelmed.--He confesses all.--Tremendous Effect\r\non Captain Tobias Ferguson.--His Selfcommand.--Considering the\r\nSituation.--Wind and Tide.--Theories as to the Position of the lost\r\nOnes.--Up Sail and after.--The last Charge to Captain Corbet._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE unfortunate Corbet thus found himself in a state of despair. The\r\nsituation, indeed; could not possibly be worse. The ship was gone;\r\nand where? Who could tell? Certainly not he. He had exhausted all his\r\nresources. From the cabin table he was unable to elicit any further\r\ninformation, nor could his aged brain furnish forth intellectual power\r\nwhich was at all adequate to the problem before it. He was alone. He had\r\nnone to help him. With Wade he did not offer to take counsel, feeling,\r\nperhaps, that Wade would be about as useful in this emergency as the\r\nAntelope’s pump.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the storm increased, and Captain Corbet felt himself unable\r\nto contend with it. The tattered old sails of the Antelope were\r\ndouble-reefed, but seemed every moment about to fly into ribbons.\r\nThere was no object in keeping his present course any longer; and so he\r\ndecided, in view of the storm and his own indecision, to lie to. And\r\nnow the Antelope tossed, and pitched, and kicked, and bounded beneath\r\nCaptain Corbet,\r\n\r\n                             “like a steed\r\n\r\n                        That knows its rider,”\r\n\r\nand Wade went below, and took refuge in sleep; and the good, the brave,\r\nyet the unhappy Corbet took up his position upon the windlass, and\r\nbestriding it, he sat for hours peering into space. There were no\r\nthoughts whatever in his mind. He tried not to speculate, he attempted\r\nnot to solve the problem; but there was, deep down in his soul, a dark,\r\ndrear sense of desolation, a woful feeling of remorse and of despair.\r\nNothing attracted his attention on that wide sea or troubled sky; not\r\nthe waste of foaming waters, not the giant masses of storm clouds, nor\r\nyet that fishing schooner, which, only a few miles off was also, like\r\nthe Antelope, lying to. Captain Corbet did not notice this stranger; he\r\ndid not speculate upon the cause of her presence; he did not see that\r\nshe was the identical vessel that he had noticed before, and therefore\r\ndid not wonder why it was that he had been followed so long and so\r\npersistently.\r\n\r\nSo he sat on the windlass, and gazed forth into illimitable space.\r\n\r\nAnd the long, long hours passed away.\r\n\r\nEvening came.\r\n\r\nDeepening into night.\r\n\r\nNight, and storm, and darkness came down, and the Antelope tossed, and\r\nplunged, and kicked, and jumped; yet the sleepless Corbet remained on\r\ndeck, occasionally shifting his position, but still overwhelmed by has\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\nTowards midnight the storm abated. Corbet waited a few hours longer, and\r\nthen stole below, hoping to forget his misery and relieve his fatigues\r\nby a little sleep.\r\n\r\nIn vain.\r\n\r\nThe air of the cabin seemed to suffocate him. Sleep was impossible. His\r\ndistressing thoughts seemed to drive him into a fever; he tried hard\r\nand for a long time to overcome them, and finally succeeded in getting a\r\nshort nap.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was dawn, and the good captain rose, and went upon deck,\r\nfeeling dejected and miserable.\r\n\r\nHe looked out over the waters, and noticed that the strange schooner was\r\nbearing down straight towards him. She was coming bows on, so that at\r\nfirst he did not know her from any other vessel; but at length she came\r\nup, and hove to close by, disclosing the symmetrical hull, the beautiful\r\nlines, the slender, tapering masts, and the swelling, snow-white canvas\r\nof the Fawn. At the same moment he saw a boat drop alongside, and into\r\nthis leaped Captain Tobias Ferguson, who at once pulled to the Antelope,\r\nand in a few minutes stood on board.\r\n\r\nThe last time that he had seen Captain Ferguson he had looked upon\r\nhim in the light of a busybody, a vexatious and too inquisitive spy,\r\na persecutor and a tormentor. But now circumstances had changed so\r\nutterly, and Captain Corbet’s sufferings both of mind and body had been\r\nso acute, that the once dreaded Ferguson appeared to him almost equal to\r\nsome Heaven-sent deliverer. His wan face flushed with joy; he could not\r\nspeak; tears burst from his eyes; and seizing Ferguson’s hand in both of\r\nhis, he clasped it tight.\r\n\r\nFerguson darted over him one swift, keen glance that took in everything,\r\nbut made no comment upon the emotion that was so visible.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, “we’re bound to meet again. The fact is, I was bound\r\nnot to lose sight of you. I tell you I got those boys on my brain, and\r\ncouldn’t get them out no how. I knew you were going to find them, or to\r\ntry to find them. I believed they were all in danger, and so I up sail\r\nand followed. And a precious hard job that following was. Why, it was\r\nlike making a race-horse follow a snail. I had to turn back every other\r\nmile or so, and go away. I saw you lie to yesterday, so I lay to; and\r\nhere I am this morning, right side up, and ready to repeat my question,\r\nWhere are the boys? So come, now, old man; no humbug, no shuffling.\r\nYou’re in a fix. I know it well enough. You’ve lost the boys. Very well.\r\nI’ll help you find ’em. So, now, make a clean breast of it, and tell\r\nme all about it from the very beginning.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, Ferguson seated himself on the taffrail, and drawing forth\r\na cigar, lighted it, and waited for Captain Corbet to begin.\r\n\r\nBut for Captain Corbet there was the difficulty. How could he begin? How\r\ncould he tell the miserable story of his madness and his folly? of\r\nthe ignorant confidence of the poor boys? of his culpable and guilty\r\nnegligence, doubly guilty, since he had deserted them not only once in\r\nleaving the ship, but a second time in sailing away from the Magdalen\r\nIslands? And for what purpose? Even had he reached the ship with the\r\nsails, could he really have saved her? Yet here stood his inquisitor,\r\nand this time his questions must be answered.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” began Captain Corbet, in a tremulous voice, “I left em--”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I--I--left--left--em--”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“I ‘--I--left em, you know.”\r\n\r\n“So you said three times; but I knew that before. The question is,\r\nWhere?”\r\n\r\n“Aboard a ship.”\r\n\r\n“Aboard a ship?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What ship? Where?\r\n\r\n“Somewhar’s about here.”\r\n\r\n“About here? But what ship?”\r\n\r\n“She--she--she--was--she--she was--wa-wa-water-logged.”\r\n\r\nAt this Ferguson started to his feet, almost leaping in the air as he\r\ndid so. For a moment he regarded the unhappy Corbet with an expression\r\nof mingled horror and incredulity.\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean it!” he said, at length.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet sighed.\r\n\r\n“What?” cried Ferguson. “Were you mad? Were they mad? Were you all\r\nraving, stark, staring distracted? What were you all thinking of? A\r\nwater-logged ship! Why, do you mean to stand there in your boots, look\r\nme in the face, and tell me that about the boys?”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet trembled from head to foot.\r\n\r\n“A water-logged ship! Why, you might as well tell me you pitched them\r\nall overboard and drowned them.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shuddered, and turned away.\r\n\r\nFerguson laid his hand upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said he, more quietly, “you couldn’t have been such a fool! You\r\nmust have considered that the boys had some chance. What sort of a ship\r\nwas she? What was her cargo?”\r\n\r\n“Timber,” said the mournful Corbet in a melancholy wail.\r\n\r\nFerguson’s face brightened.\r\n\r\n“You’re sure of that?”\r\n\r\n“Gospel sure.”\r\n\r\n“Not deals, now, or laths, or palings, or pickets, or battens, or\r\nanything of that sort?”\r\n\r\n“I saw the timber--white pine.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s better; that gives them a chance. I’ve heard say that a\r\ntimber ship’ll float for years, if she’s any kind of a ship at all; and\r\nso, perhaps, this one is drifting.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” asked Ferguson, noticing the movement.\r\n\r\n“I anchored her.”\r\n\r\n“Anchored her?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Anchored what? The timber ship?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Anchored her? That’s queer! And where?”\r\n\r\n“Why, somewhars about twenty mile or so back.”\r\n\r\n“Somewhere about twenty mile or so back!” repeated Ferguson. “Why, the\r\nman’s mad! See here, old man; what do you mean by anchoring hereabouts?\r\nDid you try soundings?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, n-n-no.”\r\n\r\n“Are you aware that the bottom is several miles down below, and that all\r\nthe chains and ropes of that ship, if they were all tied together in one\r\nline, wouldn’t begin to reach half way?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, now, railly, I hadn’t any idee. I jest kine o’ dropped anchor to\r\nhold the ship till I got back.”\r\n\r\n“Well, old man,” said Ferguson, “I’ve got a very good general idea of\r\nyour proceedings; but I want a few more particulars, so that I can judge\r\nfor myself about the poor lads. So I’ll trouble you to make a clean\r\nbreast of it, and in particular to let me know why you kept so close\r\nwhen I asked you about it before. Close? Why, if you’d been decoying\r\nthose boys out there on purpose to get rid of them, you couldn’t have\r\nfought shyer of my questions than you did.”\r\n\r\nUpon this Captain Corbet proceeded, as Ferguson called it, to “make a\r\nclean breast of it.” He began at the first, told about their failure in\r\nprovisions, their discovery of the ship, and his project of saving her.\r\nHe explained all about his reticence on the subject at the Magdalen\r\nIslands, and the cause of his voyage to Miramichi. All this was\r\naccompanied with frequent interruptions, expressive of self-reproach,\r\nexculpation, remorse, misery, and pitiable attempts at excusing his\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nFerguson listened to all without expressing any opinion, merely asking\r\na question for information here and there; and at the close of Captain\r\nCorbet’s confession, he remained forborne a considerable time buried in\r\nprofound reflection.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, “the whole story is one that won’t bear criticism. I\r\nwon’t begin. If I did, you’d hear a little of the tallest swearing that\r\never came to your ears. No, old man; I’ve got a wicked temper, and I\r\nwon’t get on that subject. The thing that you and me have got to do\r\nis, to see what can be done about those boys, and then to do it right\r\nstraight off. That’s what we’ve got to do; and when I say _we_, I mean\r\n_myself_, for you appear to have done about as much mischief as is\r\nneedful for one lifetime.”\r\n\r\nFerguson now began to pace the deck, and kept this up for about half\r\nan hour, at the end of which time he resumed his seat on the taffrail.\r\nCaptain Corbet watched him with wistful eyes, and in deep suspense; yet\r\nthere was already upon his venerable face somewhat less of grief, for he\r\nfelt a strange confidence in this eager, energetic, active, strong\r\nman, whose pertinacity had been so extraordinary, and whose singular\r\naffection for the boys had been so true and so tender.\r\n\r\n“I’m beginning,” said Ferguson, at length, “I’m beginning to see my way\r\ntowards action, and that’s something; though whether it’ll result in\r\nanything is more than I can begin to say.\r\n\r\n“In the first place, I go on the theory that this timber ship didn’t\r\nsink; that she stood this blow as solid as though she was carved out of\r\na single stick.\r\n\r\n“In the second place, I scout your idea of anchoring her. That is rank,\r\nraving insanity. To anchor a ship in three miles of water! Old man, go\r\nhome; you have no business on the sea.\r\n\r\n“So she’s been drifting; yes, drifting. She was drifting when you found\r\nher, and drifting when you left her. Where she was you can’t tell,\r\nseeing that you can’t take an observation, and didn’t take one. So we’re\r\nall astray there, and I can only calculate her probable position from\r\nthe course you took to the Magdalen Islands, and the time occupied in\r\nmaking the trip by that astonishing old tub of yours, that disgraces and\r\nridicules the respectable name of Antelope.\r\n\r\n“Very well. Now say she’s afloat, and has been drifting. The question\r\nis, Where has she drifted to? She probably was found by you somewhere\r\nabout here. That was about a week ago. Well, after the calm was over,\r\nthen came a wind. That wind was a south-easter. It got up at last into a\r\nstorm, like the blow last night.\r\n\r\n“Now, there are two things to be considered.\r\n\r\n“First, the wind.\r\n\r\n“Second, the current.\r\n\r\n“First, as to the wind. It was a steady southeaster for nearly a week,\r\nending in a hard blow. That wind has had a tendency to blow her over in\r\nthat direction--over there, nor’-west. In that direction she must have\r\nbeen steadily pushed, unless there was something to prevent, some ocean\r\ncurrents or other.\r\n\r\n“And this brings us to the next point--the currents.\r\n\r\n“Now, over there, about thirty miles south of this, there is a current\r\nsetting out into the Atlantic from the River St. Lawrence; and up there,\r\nthirty miles to the north, there is considerable of a current, that runs\r\nup into the Straits of Belle Isle. Just round about here there is a sort\r\nof eddy, or a back current, that flows towards the Island of Anticosti.\r\nNow, that happens to be the identical place towards which the wind would\r\ncarry her. So, you see, granting that the Petrel has remained afloat,\r\nthe wind and the currents must both have acted on her in such a way as\r\nto carry her to that desert island, that horrible, howling wilderness,\r\nthat abomination of desolation, that graveyard of ships and\r\nseamen--Anticosti.”\r\n\r\nAt this intelligence, Captain Corbet’s heart once more sank within him.\r\n\r\n“Anti--Anticosti!” he murmured, in a trembling voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Anticosti. And I ain’t surprised, not a bit surprised,” said\r\nFerguson. “I said so. I prophesied it. I was sure of it. I read it\r\nin their faces at Magdalen. When I saw that rotten old tub, and those\r\nyoungsters, something told me they were going to wind up by getting on\r\nAnticosti. When I saw you come back to Magdalen, I was sure of it.\r\nI followed you to Miramichi to find out; and ever since I’ve been\r\nfollowing you, I’ve had Anticosti in my mind, as the only place I was\r\nbound to.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said he, “at any rate, it’s better for them than\r\nbein--bein--at--at the bottom of the sea.”\r\n\r\n“’Tain’t any better, if they’ve been smashed against the rocks of\r\nAnticosti in last night’s gale,” retorted Ferguson, who was not willing\r\nthat Captain Corbet should recover from his anxiety too soon.\r\n\r\n“But mayn’t she--mayn’t she--catch?”\r\n\r\n“Catch?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“Why--her--her anchor. It’s been down all the time. That thar anchor had\r\nought to catch hold of somethin.”\r\n\r\nFerguson slapped his thighs with both hands with tremendous force.\r\n\r\n“You’re right! right are you, old man, for once! For the moment, I had\r\nforgotten about the anchor. That saves them. That anchor’s bound to\r\ncatch; for, after all, I don’t think last night’s storm was bad enough\r\nto make her drag. At any rate, it gives them a chance, And now--off we\r\ngo.” With these words, Ferguson jumped into his boat.\r\n\r\nHe turned his head once more. “Old man, mark me--? all you’ve got to do\r\nis to follow straight after me.”\r\n\r\n“But you’ll get away in the night.”\r\n\r\n“So I will. Well, then, you head straight nothe-west and by nothe.\r\nI’ll pick you up some time tomorrow. We’ll cruise along the shore of\r\nAnticosti till we find the ship.”\r\n\r\nWith these words, Ferguson seized the oars. A dozen strokes brought\r\nhim alongside of his own schooner. He leaped on board, and the boat was\r\nhauled up astern.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the Fawn spread her snow-white wings, and headed away\r\n“nothe-west and by nothe.”\r\n\r\nThe Antelope followed.\r\n\r\nBefore evening the Fawn was out of sight.\r\n\r\nBut Captain Corbet stood calmly and confidently at the helm, and steered\r\n“nothe-west and by nothe.” His despair had subsided, leaving only a mild\r\nmelancholy that was not unbecoming; but his soul was full of hope, for\r\nhe had confidence in Ferguson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\n_The Cove.--The grassy Knoll.--The Brook.--A Reconnoitre.--The Bed of\r\nthe Brook.--Far up into the Country.--A rough Road.--Return.--The\r\nAroma of the strange Dinner.--Solomon again in his Glory.--A great\r\nSurprise.--A Resolution.--Drawing of Lots.--The fated Two.--Last Visit\r\nto the Petrel.--Final Preparations.--A sound Sleep.--The Embarkation.\r\n--The white Sail lost to View._.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE cove into which they pulled seemed to the boys to be the most\r\nbeautiful place that they had ever seen. Such a thought was natural,\r\nafter such a passage from the wrecked ship, and from the terrors of the\r\nsea to this peaceful and sheltered nook; and, indeed, more unprejudiced\r\nobservers might have been charmed with such a place. The hills encircled\r\nit, covered with trees; the brook babbled over pebbles into the sea; the\r\ngrassy knoll rose invitingly in front of them; while behind them was the\r\nsea, upon which the ship floated low in the water. The boys looked upon\r\nthis with enthusiastic delight; but Solomon’s face was turned away; he\r\nwas bowed down low, and staring intently into the water. That water was\r\nastonishingly clear and transparent; and Solomon found an attractiveness\r\nin the sea bottom which made all other things seem dull and commonplace.\r\nHe said nothing, however, and the boys were too much taken up with the\r\nbeauties of the place to notice his attitude.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the biscuit and the chest of provisions were put\r\nashore; and Solomon’s first act was to take the former out of the barrel\r\nand spread them out over the grass, so that they might dry in the sun.\r\nBut the boys had other aims. Their first desire was to explore the\r\ncountry; and as they knew well from past experience how easy it was to\r\nget lost in the woods, they sought about, first of all, for some sort of\r\na path or trail. Nothing of the kind could be seen. Phil then suggested\r\ngoing up the bed of the brook. His forest experiences had made him far\r\nmore fruitful in resources than any of them; and the stream occurred\r\nto him at once as the readiest way of passing through the impenetrable\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nAccordingly they all set forth by this path. The brook was not very\r\nwide, and the trees almost met overhead; the water was only a few inches\r\nin depth, chiefly composed of gravel, and occasionally interspersed with\r\nlarger masses, which offered a succession of stepping-stones. As they\r\nwent along, they never ceased to look most carefully in all directions\r\nfor any traces of a path, however faint. The utter absence of anything\r\nof the sort excited their surprise, but only led them to continue their\r\njourney still farther. The way at length grew more difficult. They came\r\nto a rising ground, where the brook had worn a bed for itself. Here the\r\npath became rough, and full of mud and clay. Every few steps they\r\ncame to trees which had fallen across. But they worked their way along\r\nbravely, and at length reached the top of the rising ground. Here they\r\nfound themselves in the forest, with nothing visible on every side but\r\nspruce trees of moderate size. They walked on for two or three hours,\r\ntraversing fallen trees, and rocks, and mud; but at length they came to\r\na place where the brook lost itself in a swampy soil. Here there was a\r\ndense and impenetrable underbrush, and no longer even such a pathway as\r\nthe bed of the brook had afforded. They all saw that it was impossible\r\nto proceed any farther, and therefore they concluded to return.\r\n\r\nTheir calculations led them to suppose that they had gone many miles;\r\nyet in all that distance they had found no trace whatever of any\r\nhuman beings. They had not come upon even the rudest trail. This fact\r\nimpressed them all very forcibly. Hitherto, each one had had a different\r\ntheory as to the country; and no less than five provinces were claimed,\r\nin order to support the theory of each. But they all knew that it would\r\nbe difficult indeed to find a place in any one of those five\r\nprovinces, where a march could be made for so great a distance, without\r\nencountering some signs of humanity, past, if not present. In all of\r\nthem the woods had been scoured by lumbering parties, or, at least, by\r\nhunting parties; and if there were no paths made by lumbermen, there\r\nmight be found, at least, some trail. Pat, of course, gave up the\r\nMagdalen Islands; Bruce gave up Miramichi: Tom, Prince Edward’s Island;\r\nand Bart, Cape Breton. There remained, then, the belief of Phil in\r\nNewfoundland, and that of Arthur in Gaspé. Upon these two localities the\r\nparty divided; and though in the laborious journey back they were too\r\nmuch fatigued to expend their breath in argument, yet, when they did\r\nreach their journey’s end, they were all prepared for it.\r\n\r\nBut all argument was postponed for the present by the advent of dinner.\r\n\r\nIt was late when they got back. They had eaten nothing since breakfast.\r\nThey found Solomon waiting for them most impatiently. He had kindled a\r\nfire under a rock, and had taken the trouble to go back to the ship for\r\nsome pots, kettles, and pans. A pot was even now hanging over the fire,\r\nand when they reached the place, there issued from this pot a stream so\r\nsavory, so aromatic, so odoriferous, and so enticing, that in an instant\r\nevery other thought vanished from their minds.\r\n\r\n“O, Solomon,” was the cry, “what is it that you’ve got there?”\r\n\r\nAnd they rushed up to the place.\r\n\r\nBut Solomon, brandishing a huge ladle, waved them back with solemn\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n“You look heah, chilen; don’t you go bodder yer heads bout dis yer;\r\nit’s a kine o’ soup dat I ben a concoctin’; an you’ll know when de time\r\ncomes. Jes now, you’d all bes lie down ober dar, an res yourselves. I\r\nben worritin’ bout you for ten hour an more. You didn’t ought to go for\r\nto ’crease de ’ziety ob dis ole man; cos he ain’t able to hole up.\r\nBut nebber mind; you’re all safe an soun; so now you all jes lay by a\r\nfew minutes, an I’ll walk dis yer dish off de hook in no time.”\r\n\r\nThe boys respected Solomon’s whim, and fell back. A few dishes,\r\nwith spoons, were lying on the grass, and towards these they allowed\r\nthemselves to drift, and then flung their weary frames upon the ground\r\nnear by.\r\n\r\nSolomon was true to his word. He did not keep them long waiting. In a\r\nshort time he took the pot off the fire, and brought it towards them. He\r\nthen filled each of the dishes in silence.\r\n\r\nThe savory steam rose up; its odor was now unmistakable. Scarce able to\r\nbelieve the evidence of the sense of smell, they hurried to appeal to\r\nthat of taste. One mouthful was enough. A cry of joy burst from them\r\nall, followed by,--\r\n\r\n“Oysters! Oyster stew! O, glorious! Solomon, where in the world did you\r\nfind these?”\r\n\r\nSolomon’s eyes beamed with quiet exultation; he drew a long breath of\r\nsilent rapture, and gently rubbed his-old hands together. For a few\r\nmoments his emotions deprived him of the power of utterance; but at\r\nlength he found voice.\r\n\r\n“Well, chilen, to tell de troof, I intended it as a great ‘prise, for\r\nyou. I saw dem dis yer mornin when we landed, and didn’t say nuffin.\r\nBut dar dey is--dem’s um. De cove is full; nuff heah to feed a ship’s\r\ncompany ten years; an we’s boun to feed on de fat ob de lan so long as\r\nwe stick to dis yer place. Dat’s so; mind I tell you. Yes, sir.” After\r\nsuch a repast as this, they all felt much more able to grapple with the\r\ndifficulties of their situation. And now once more arose the question,\r\nwhat land this was upon which they had been thrown.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Arthur, “there’s no use now to talk about the Magdalen\r\nIslands, or Prince Edward’s Island, or Cape Breton, or even Miramichi.\r\nThis coast lies east and west, as we saw while we were drifting towards\r\nit. We came from a southeast direction towards it; we can tell now.\r\nThere’s the west, where the sun is soon going to set, and there’s the\r\nsouth. Now, my idea is, that this must be Gaspé. Besides, the desolation\r\nof the country shows that it must be Gaspé.”\r\n\r\nPhil shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Gaspé doesn’t lie east and west,” said he; “and it may just as well be\r\nMiramichi as Gaspé. The fact is, it can’t be either of them. It must be\r\nNewfoundland. We’ve drifted up from the south, and have been driven upon\r\nthese shores. I can’t imagine where it is, but I rather think it may be\r\nthe south-west corner of the island. If that is right, then settlements\r\nought to be not very far away; only we can’t get to them by land.\r\nThere’s St. Pierre’s Island east, and there’s the Bay of Islands.”\r\n\r\n“It’s rather a bad lookout’ for us,” said Tom, “if there isn’t any\r\nsettlement nearer than St. Pierre or the Bay of Islands. Why, there are\r\nhundreds of miles of the roughest coast in the world lying between.\r\nWe may be on the coast, as you say; somewhere between Cape Ray and\r\nFortune’s Bay; but how we are ever to get to any settlement is a little\r\nbeyond me.”\r\n\r\n“There’s the boat,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“What can we do with the boat?” said Tom. “We have no oars. I don’t feel\r\ninclined to set out on a long journey with paddles like those. They\r\ndo very well to land a shipwrecked party, but are hardly the things to\r\nstart off with on a sea voyage. I tried going about with a bit of board\r\nonce, and didn’t find, that it worked very well.”\r\n\r\n“O, we can rig up a sail. We can get something on board the Petrel\r\nthat’ll do--some quilts, or, better yet, some sheets.”\r\n\r\n“Sheets aren’t big enough,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Well, we can sew two or three of them together. They’re good, strong\r\nsheets, and they’ll do very well for the boat. As for a mast, why, we\r\ncan find a very good one here in the woods in five minutes.”\r\n\r\n“But what direction should we take?”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s a question that requires a good deal of careful\r\nconsideration.”\r\n\r\n“My opinion is,” said Tom, “that it is by far the best to sail east. If\r\nwe sail west, we could scarce hope to meet with any one till we got\r\nto the Bay of Islands; and we’d have to double Cape Bay,--which is\r\naltogether too dangerous a thing for a little boat like this. But if we\r\ngo east, we’ll have more chances of shelter in case of storms, and we’ll\r\nbe sure to reach some sort of settlement, either St. Pierre or some\r\nfishing stations on the main land, or in Fortune’s Bay.”\r\n\r\n“East, then, is the course,” said Bart. “And now, who of us shall go?\r\nWe’d better not all go.”\r\n\r\n“Well, no; I suppose not.”\r\n\r\n“Of course not,” said Bruce. “The boat isn’t large enough. Two will be\r\nplenty. The rest of us can stay here.”\r\n\r\n“If the boat goes,” said Arthur, “those of us who stay behind won’t be\r\nable to go on board the ship.’ Shall we stay aboard or ashore?”\r\n\r\n“For my part,” said Pat, “I won’t put a fut aboard that ship again as\r\nlong as I live.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll stay here, or else go in the boat,” said Phil. “I’m ready to do\r\neither.”\r\n\r\n“I’m quite of Pat’s opinion,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m not anxious to visit the ship again,” said Bart, “not even as\r\na salvor, and I certainly would not stay aboard of her.”\r\n\r\n“It’s too comfortable here altogether,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“And so say I,” said Bruce. “The fact is, boys, we’re all of one mind\r\nabout the Petrel. Her glory is departed; and after that night in the\r\nmizzen-top, we don’t fancy trying any other nights.”\r\n\r\n“Fortunately,” said Tom, “the wind has changed. It’ll be fair for the\r\nboat if she goes east.”\r\n\r\n“But who are to go?” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Bruce, “that the best way will be to draw lots. What do\r\nyou say, boys?”\r\n\r\nTo this proposal they all assented. Bruce thereupon took some bits of\r\ngrass, and broke them up into different lengths.\r\n\r\n“Two of these,” said he, “are short; the rest are long. Those who draw\r\nthe short ones are to go in the boat. Will that do?”\r\n\r\n“All right.”\r\n\r\nUpon this Bruce put the pieces of grass in his hat, stirred them about;\r\nand then laid the hat in the midst. Each one then shut his eyes and took\r\na piece of grass from the hat. Then they all held them forth.\r\n\r\nAnd it was seen that the two shortest pieces had been drawn by Arthur\r\nand Tom.\r\n\r\nUpon this every one of the other boys offered to exchange places with\r\neither one of these, and go in his stead. But Arthur and Tom were both\r\nfirm in their refusal.\r\n\r\n“What are you going to take with you?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Arthur, “first of all, we’ll need to have a sail. I think\r\nwe’d better make a raid on the Petrel at once, and hunt up some sheets.\r\nTom and I will go, and you fellows might find a couple of sticks that’ll\r\ndo for the mast and pole.”\r\n\r\n“O, by the way,” said Bart, “if you’re going aboard, you’d better bring\r\nback some more biscuit. We won’t have enough.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go and help you,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“And I too,” said Phil.\r\n\r\nThe boys now pushed off,--Arthur, and Tom, and Bruce, and Phil. In\r\nabout a quarter of an hour they reached the ship, and boarded her.\r\nThey noticed now that the change of the wind had caused a corresponding\r\nchange of position. She had swung round at her anchor, and was very much\r\nnearer the headland before spoken of.\r\n\r\n“It’s my opinion.” said Tom, “that she’s been dragging her anchor a\r\nlittle.”\r\n\r\n“She’s certainly a good deal nearer the shore,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“She’s so deep down,” said Bruce, “that she’ll touch bottom if she drags\r\nmuch longer,--and a strong breeze might do it too.”\r\n\r\n“If it does,” said Phil, “then good by forever to her. A timber ship may\r\nhold together as long as she keeps in deep water; but these rocks would\r\nsoon grind her to powder, if she touched them.”\r\n\r\n“Let her grind,” say I.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I give up my share of the salvage.”\r\n\r\n“The best place for her will be the bottom of the sea.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate, we’ll make one final haul, boys, and take ashore\r\neverything that may be needed at all.”\r\n\r\nThe boys now hurried to complete their preparations, for the sun was\r\nnot more than one half hour above the horizon, and there was no time to\r\nspare. Arthur went to secure the sails. He selected a half dozen of the\r\nlargest sheets, and flung them into the boat. They were the coarsest\r\nand strongest which he could find. Tom found some sail needles and sail\r\ntwine in a drawer in the pantry, where he remembered having seen them\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThey then rolled out four barrels of biscuit, and put them on board\r\nthe boat. After this they put six hams in her, and all the rest of the\r\npotted meat, and canned vegetables, and other dainties. Phil looked with\r\nlonging eyes at the galley stove, but concluded that it was best not to\r\ntry to convey that ashore. Finally, they took all the blankets, for they\r\nwere articles that promised to be always useful.\r\n\r\nWith this cargo they returned to the shore.\r\n\r\nArthur then went to work at his sail, while Tom went to see about the\r\nmast. He found that Bart had already nearly finished one that was very\r\nsuitable. In smoothing this, in fitting it into the boat, and in shaping\r\na pole, another hour or so was taken up. Meanwhile Arthur had found that\r\nthree of the sheets were large enough. These he stitched together, and\r\nafterwards cut it the right shape.\r\n\r\nIt was then secured to the mast, and the little boat was all ready for\r\nher voyage.\r\n\r\nBut they had still more preparations to make. First of all, the\r\nspy-glass, which had been brought ashore in the chest, was deposited in\r\nthe boat. Then, a barrel of the biscuit that Solomon had dried in the\r\nsun was put on board, together with a sufficient supply of potted meats.\r\nA jug of water was considered sufficient, as they expected to land\r\nfrom time to time, and would be able to replenish it, if it should be\r\nnecessary. For warmth or shelter, three or four blankets, which the\r\ncareful forethought of Solomon had dried in front of the blazing fire,\r\nwere deemed amply sufficient.\r\n\r\nBefore these were completed it was dark. Of course they had no intention\r\nof setting off that evening, though Tom was at first of the opinion that\r\nthey had better start, and take advantage of so fine a night. But the\r\nothers overruled him, and expressed the opinion that they had better\r\nsail by night as little as possible.\r\n\r\nSolomon kept the fire heaped high with fuel, not for the purposes of\r\nwarmth, for the air was balmy and pleasant, but more for the sake of\r\ncheerfulness. He had found no difficulty in procuring dry wood from the\r\nfallen trees in the forest. Brightly the flames leaped up, throwing\r\na pleasant glow over the surrounding scene. The contrast between this\r\nevening and the evening of the previous day was thought of and felt by\r\nall; and more than once there arose from the warm, grateful hearts of\r\nthese honest lads a prayer of thankfulness to that Being who had heard\r\ntheir cry in the stormy sea, and had saved them from destruction.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning they were all awake. Solomon already had\r\nbreakfast prepared. It was a bright and beautiful morning. The little\r\ncove looked charming. But on the sea the Petrel still floated; but they\r\nwere all sure that she was nearer than ever to the headland.\r\n\r\nA pleasant breeze was blowing, and all things promised well. Arthur and\r\nTom finished their breakfast, and then, bidding all the rest good by,\r\nthey embarked, and pushed off.\r\n\r\nThe wind filled the sail, and the little boat moved out of the cove, and\r\naway to sea. The boys watched their departing friends in solemn silence,\r\nuntil the white sail disappeared around the headland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\n_Trouble and Consolation.--A fresh Proposal.--The Building of the\r\nCamp.--Hard Work.--The triumphant Result.--Blisters and Balsam.--A new\r\nSurprise by Solomon.--Illumination.--The rising Wind.--They go forth\r\nto explore.--The impending Fate of the Petrel.--Wind and Wave.--A rough\r\nResting-place.--What will be the Fate of the Ship?--The Headland.--The\r\nView.--Where are our departed Friends?_\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER the little white sail had disappeared around the headland, the\r\nboys stood in silence for some time. The departure of Arthur and Tom had\r\nmade a perceptible breach in their numbers, and the thought that they\r\nhad gone on a long, an uncertain, and a perilous expedition seemed to\r\nthrow an air of gloom over those who remained behind.\r\n\r\nBart was the first to rouse himself.\r\n\r\n“Seventy-four hours, with this wind; ought to do it,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Do what?” asked Bruce.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bart, “I’ve been making a calculation. I don’t see how St.\r\nPierre can be more than a hundred miles from here at the very farthest.\r\nNow, this breeze ought to take them four or five miles an hour, and if\r\nthey went on without stopping, they certainly ought to reach St. Pierre\r\nby this time to-morrow, even if they don’t find any settlements or any\r\nfishing vessels on the way.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but they won’t find it so easy to get back,” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“O, yes, they will,” said Bart. “They won’t have to work their own way\r\nback. They’ll get a schooner, and have no trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bruce, “we’ll have to allow a week, at least.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Phil. “It won’t do for us to tie them down to two\r\ndays. If we do, we’ll be all the time in a fever, and watch for them day\r\nand night. I’m determined not to expect them at all this time.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an that’s the wisest risolution we can make, so it is,” said Pat,\r\nsedately; “and, be the same token, it’s a month I’m goin to allow, so it\r\nis; an, what’s more, I’m thinkin we’ll betther be afther buildin a bit\r\nof a house, or tint, or camp.”\r\n\r\n“A camp!” cried Bart. “Hurrah! that’s the very thing.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” cried Phil; “just like the camp in the woods behind the hill at\r\nGrand Pré.”\r\n\r\n“The very best thing we could think of,” said Bruce. “It’ll give us all\r\nsomething to do, and at the same time it’s a positive necessity.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a pity we hadn’t some of that spare lumber on board the Petrel,”\r\n said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Phil, “I think we’ll have it all before another day;\r\nfor, from present appearances, she’ll be on the rocks soon; and if so,\r\nthere’ll be a general free delivery of her cargo all along the beach.\r\nBut we needn’t wait for that.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an there’s nothin betther,” said Pat, “thin good honist spruce.\r\nWe can get sticks enough all around us, an have a camp that’ll be as\r\nwarrum, and as dhry, and as whowlsome as iver was, so we will.”\r\n\r\nThere was a hatchet which had been brought ashore in the chest, and had\r\nalready done good service in making the masts for the boat. This was now\r\nmade use of for the purpose of getting the necessary supply of poles\r\nand brush for the camp. As there was only one hatchet, they could not\r\nof course cut the brush quite so fast as was desirable; but Bruce cut\r\npretty quickly, and kept two of them well employed in carrying the poles\r\nand brush to the grassy knoll. Phil and Pat did this work while Bart\r\noccupied himself with the preparation of the ground for the erection of\r\nthe camp. He first selected a place that seemed suitable, where there\r\nwas a level space, about twelve feet square. Then he sharpened one of\r\nthe stakes, and cutting off a portion of it, about three feet long, he\r\nhardened the point by burning it in the fire. He then marked out the\r\nline of foundation, and made holes in the ground all around the\r\nmarked space, so that the stakes might be inserted without any delay.\r\nFortunately there were no stones to interfere with his work. The ground\r\nwas sandy, and he drove his stake in without any difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn this way they worked until noon, when Solomon called them to dinner.\r\nAll the boys were amazed at finding that the time had passed so\r\nrapidly; and they saw by this a fresh and striking example of the\r\nimportance of having some pleasant occupation in life. It had been for\r\nwant of this, to a great extent, that their time had dragged along so\r\nslowly, first during the famine on board the Antelope, and afterwards on\r\nboard the Petrel.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner they examined their work, and concluded that the immense\r\nheap of stakes and brushwood ought to suffice for the needs of any\r\nordinary camp; so now they proceeded to the important task of its\r\nerection.\r\n\r\nBart had made a double row of holes around four sides, which were\r\nintended to enclose the camp. These holes were about a foot apart, and\r\nthe rows were separated by a space of about three inches.\r\n\r\nThe next task was to prepare the stakes. These were sharpened, and cut\r\nabout seven feet long; and as fast as each one was prepared, it was\r\ninserted as tightly as possible in one of the holes. Before long all the\r\nstakes were set up, and the outline of the camp became dimly visible.\r\nBart and Phil now went off in search of roots, which might serve the\r\npurpose of cords, to bind together those portions of the frame which\r\nneeded securing, leaving Bruce and Pat at work preparing other stakes,\r\nthe one with his hatchet, and the other with a knife. The roots were\r\nfound without any difficulty, most of them belonging to a species of\r\ndwarf willow, or osier, and they were as flexible and as strong as the\r\nstoutest cord.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to take four long poles, and bind these along the\r\ntop of each row of stakes, so as to form the eaves of the camp. When all\r\nthese were secured, the framework was quite as strong as was necessary.\r\n\r\nIt now remained to form the roof. This was a matter of some difficulty,\r\nbut was at length successfully achieved. They had all had so much\r\npractice in camp-building, that there was but little hesitation at any\r\nstage of the proceedings. The way in which the roof was erected was\r\nso ingenious that it deserves to be explained. They procured two stout\r\npoles, about fifteen feet long, which they put at each end of the\r\nstructure, binding each firmly in its place, and leaving at the top a\r\nfork, formed from the projecting stump of one of the severed branches.\r\nAcross these, and resting on these forks, they laid their ridge-pole,\r\nand bound this firmly in its place. To make it still stronger, they\r\nset up a third support in the middle of the camp, and thus made the\r\nridge-pole firm enough to bear the weight of any of them.\r\n\r\nAfter this they proceeded to lay a row of poles along from the eaves to\r\nthe ridge-pole, and others again intersecting these. Thus they formed a\r\nframework close enough and strong enough to admit of brush being placed\r\nupon it, and this they proceeded to lay there after the manner of\r\nthatch. The roof was pretty steep, and the spruce brush was so smooth,\r\nand was laid on so compactly, that it could have resisted any ordinary\r\nrain storm.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of their task was easy enough, the roof and frame having\r\nbeen by far the most troublesome. One side was allotted to each, and\r\nthe work was interweaving spruce brush along the stakes. The space\r\nwas twelve feet long by six high. They began from the ground, and went\r\nupward; and at length this was finished.\r\n\r\nThere was still an open space at each gable end, but it was their\r\nintention to leave windows here. Poles were fastened in such a way that\r\na square space was left in each gable, which admitted an ample amount of\r\nlight, and the remainder was filled in with brush, like the sides. The\r\ndoor, of course, had been attended to in the construction of the frame.\r\n\r\nIt had been hard work, but they were all adepts at the business, and\r\nknew exactly how to do each thing. The consequence was, that by sundown\r\ntheir camp was all completed, and only needed a few finishing touches,\r\nwhich could very well be postponed till the following day.\r\n\r\nThey all sat down to their evening repast with the consciousness that\r\nthey had passed a well-spent day. Solomon had done his duty, as usual,\r\nwith a minute conscientiousness, and a painful care of the smallest\r\ndetails, which was evinced by the exquisite flavor of the oyster stew.\r\nThe chief regret that they had was, that Arthur and Tom were not there\r\nto share it.\r\n\r\nAfter tea none of them ventured to move. They were more utterly fagged\r\nout than they ever remembered to have been in the whole course of\r\ntheir lives. There had, of course, been times when they had been more\r\nexhausted, and Phil could tell a tale of weariness which might have\r\nshamed his present feelings; but for the fatigue resulting from sheer\r\nhard work, they never knew anything that had equalled this. Their hands\r\nwere all covered with blisters and balsam, while an additional air of\r\nshabbiness had been given to them by new rents and tatters in their\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nAfter sunset they noticed that the wind was stronger and the sea\r\nrougher. The Petrel had moved also still farther in to the shore.\r\n\r\n“Another night’ll finish her,” said Bruce, “if this wind continues.”\r\n\r\n“I hope they’ll land,” said Bart, thinking of Arthur and Tom.\r\n\r\n“Well, as to that,” said Bruce, “it seems to me that they won’t feel\r\ninclined to sail all night; and they’ll land, if they only can; but the\r\ntrouble is, they may find themselves off some coast where no landing can\r\nbe made.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say,” said Bart, thoughtfully, “that the coast is rough enough\r\nall along, for most of the way; but then, fortunately, this wind is off\r\nthe land; so they’ll be all right. The danger would be if it was in any\r\nother direction. As it is, the closer they keep in to the shore, the\r\nsafer they’ll be; and, in fact, the safest place for them would be close\r\nin under the highest cliffs.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that certainly is a consolation,” said Bruce, with a sigh of\r\nrelief. “I’ve been a good deal bothered all the afternoon, for I noticed\r\nthat the wind was rising. I rather think you’re in the right of it,\r\nBart, and I’m glad enough that you thought of that.”\r\n\r\n“O, they’re all right,” said Phil, “as long as the wind is this way.”\r\n\r\n“The throuble is,” said Pat, “they might have to go round some headland,\r\nand thin they’d catch it, hot and heavy.”\r\n\r\n“O, they wouldn’t try it if it was too rough,” said Bart. “They’d haul\r\nup ashore, and wait till the wind went down. The fact is, they’ll do\r\njust as any of us would do in the same circumstances. Neither Arthur nor\r\nTom is inclined to run any risks. They know that there’s no hurry, that\r\nwe’ve got lots of provisions. They’ve got a good supply, too, and so\r\nthey’ll take it easy. My opinion is, they both landed two or three hours\r\nago, hauled up their boat high and dry, picked up some drift wood, and\r\nare at this moment sitting in front of a roaring fire, calmly discussing\r\nwhat had best be done to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nThis discussion about the fate of their two absent friends made them\r\nall feel quite at their ease once more, and soon after they went to bed\r\ninside of the camp.\r\n\r\nHere they found a pleasant surprise awaiting them, which had been\r\ndevised by Solomon. He had taken the fat out of some of the jars\r\nof potted meat, and put it in two cups. In these he had ingeniously\r\narranged floating wicks, and lighted them. So now, as the boys entered,\r\nthey were surprised at a cheerful glow inside. At first they were\r\nalarmed, and thought the camp was on fire; but a second look showed them\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\nTheir camp now seemed very cheerful indeed. The ground was quite dry,\r\nand each one rolled himself up in his blanket, which formed their only\r\npreparation for bed. Here, reclining on the soft grass, with the green\r\nwalls of their camp encircling them, they chatted pleasantly for a short\r\ntime, and at length, one by one, dropped off into sound and refreshing\r\nslumbers.\r\n\r\nOn awaking they all hurried forth. They found that the wind had\r\nincreased, and must have been increasing all night. Close in under\r\nthe shore the water was smooth enough, but a mile outside it began\r\nto roughen, and a white line of breakers shone along the base of the\r\nheadland.\r\n\r\nBut it was the Petrel that now engaged all their attention. She had\r\nbeen forced in to within a stone’s throw of the shore, and had evidently\r\ntouched bottom, for she lay a little over on one side. She had reached\r\na place where the sea felt the effect of the wind, and the waves broke\r\nover her decks. She rose and fell occasionally, with a slow, heavy\r\nmovement, at the force of the waves that beat upon her. The shore\r\nimmediately opposite the place where she had grounded was all white with\r\nfoam, and it seemed as if the bottom where she touched might be strewn\r\nwith rough, jagged rocks.\r\n\r\nHard indeed was the resting-place to which the Petrel had come after so\r\nlong a wandering!\r\n\r\nThe boys looked on in silence. They did not exactly lament the fate\r\nwhich seemed to impend over her, but, at the same time, they felt as\r\nthough, in some way, it might be a disaster to themselves. For the\r\nPetrel, as long as she had floated, had served, at least, as a sort of\r\nsignal by which any passing vessel might be attracted; whereas, if she\r\nwere destroyed, their chance of rescue in that way grew less. They also\r\nfelt that the large store of provisions and supplies on board might yet\r\nbe needed; and in case of the unsuccessful return of Arthur and Tom,\r\nthey might need to visit her once more. But now all hope of this\r\nseemed at an end. In this half-developed regret at her fate, there was,\r\nhowever, no thought of salvage; that subject was forgotten.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast their attention was once more directed to the Petrel.\r\nAny further operations in the camp had now to be postponed, for the\r\nattractions of the imperilled ship were too engrossing to admit of\r\nlesser thoughts.\r\n\r\n“I say, boys,” said Bruce, “why can’t we try to get nearer? We can work\r\nour way along at the top of the bank, I should think.”\r\n\r\n“Of course we can,” said Bart. “At any rate, it’s not very far.”\r\n\r\n“It won’t be worse than the upper part of that miserable brook,” said\r\nPhil.\r\n\r\n“Sure an I’d go on me hands and knees all the way, so I would, to git\r\nnearer to her,” said Pat.\r\n\r\nThe coast that ran along terminated in the headland, between which and\r\nthe cove it consisted of steep banks, at first wooded, and rough cliffs.\r\nThe top of the bank all along was covered with trees, and seemed to\r\noffer no greater difficulties than any other part of the woods. The\r\nheadland itself seemed over a mile away, and the Petrel was some\r\ndistance inside of this.\r\n\r\nThey thus resolved to go, and set forth at once.\r\n\r\n“Be back in time for dinna,” said Solomon, as they climbed up the steep\r\nbank to get to the top..\r\n\r\n“O, yes,” was the reply, as they vanished into the woods.\r\n\r\nIt was decidedly rough walking. The ground was uneven, rising into\r\nmounds and depressed into hollows. Sometimes fallen trees lay before\r\nthem; at other times underbrush so dense and so stubborn that a way\r\ncould only be forced through with the most persevering effort. Besides,\r\nit was absolutely necessary to keep as near as possible to the edge of\r\nthe cliff, for they all knew how easily they might be lost, if they once\r\nventured out of sight of it. So they kept on, close by the brink,\r\neven though places occasionally appeared which seemed much easier to\r\ntraverse.\r\n\r\nAt length they reached the place immediately opposite the Petrel. She\r\nlay within easy stone’s throw. Before them the cliff went down with\r\nrough, jagged sides, and the shore at its foot was covered with masses\r\nof rock that had fallen there from the precipice. It was not more than\r\nsixty or seventy feet down. On this elevation, and at this distance out,\r\nthey felt the full force of the blast.\r\n\r\nThe Petrel had certainly grounded, and it was evident to them that the\r\nbottom was rough and irregular. She lay over on her side, her stern\r\nnearest to the shore. The bows were sunk under to the depth of about\r\na foot, while the stern rose a little. She swayed backward and forward\r\nwith a regular motion, and there was a dull, gringing, creaking noise,\r\nthat came from her to their ears, and was plainly discernible through\r\nthe noise of the surf on the rocks below. The sea at this point was\r\nquite heavy, and rolled over and over the doomed ship. The long waves\r\ncame sweeping up at successive intervals, and at every stroke the Petrel\r\nwould yield, and then slowly struggle back.\r\n\r\n“I wonder how long she can stand this sort of thing,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“Not long, I should think,” said Bart; “but after all, the wind isn’t\r\nvery strong just yet, and if there are no rocks under her, she may hold\r\nout some time.”\r\n\r\n“If this wind grows to a gale, she’s done for.”\r\n\r\n“But then it may not get any worse, and if it goes down, I’d undertake\r\nto swim on board.”\r\n\r\n“O, of course, if it gets smooth.”\r\n\r\n“What do you say to going out to the point?” said Bruce.\r\n\r\n“O, yes, let’s go.”\r\n\r\nThe point was not far away, and the woods were thinner. They reached\r\nit without much difficulty. Standing here an extensive scene came upon\r\ntheir view.\r\n\r\nOn the left, the coast line ran on for a few miles, rough and rugged\r\ncliffs, with a crest of stunted trees. On the right, the coast line was\r\nwhat they had already seen. In front was the boundless sea, covered with\r\nfoaming waves. At their feet the surf thundered in a line of foam, and\r\ntossed its spray high on the air.\r\n\r\n“I don’t altogether like the look of things,” said Bruce, after a long\r\nand silent gaze upon the sea and the rough coast in the west.\r\n\r\n“O, don’t fret,” said Bart. “Look, Bruce, close in to the shore under\r\nthe cliffs: why, it’s smooth enough there to paddle a raft in. They’ll\r\nkeep close in to the shore, and land whenever they want to.”\r\n\r\n“Only they might try to round a headland like that,” said Bruce,\r\npointing to a cliff which terminated the view towards the left, at the\r\nbase of which there was a line of white foam; “and if they did,” he\r\nadded, “I’m afraid neither Arthur nor Tom--”\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly, leaving the sentence unfinished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\n_The Expedition and the Voyagers.--Speculations.--Dinner followed by\r\na Change of Wind.--A Squall.--Shipping a Sea.--Nearer the Shore.--An\r\niron-bound Coast.--Rounding the Headland.--Startling Sight.--The Column\r\nof Smoke.--A Man on the Beach.--The shipwrecked Stranger.--Astonishing\r\nDisclosures.--Where are we?--The mournful Truth.--Anticosti!--Arthur\r\ncontains his Soul.--The Boys and the Boat both hauled up.--The\r\nExpedition ends._\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHUR and Tom, on rounding the headland, kept on their course,\r\nfollowing the line of the shore. The water was smooth, and the breeze\r\ncontinued moderate, yet fair. The sail worked well, the boat glided\r\nsmoothly through the water, and they slipped on past the shore at a rate\r\nwhich was most gratifying to both of them. They kept away about a mile\r\nfrom the land, a distance which seemed to them to allow of a ready\r\nresort there in case of need, while at the same time it was far enough\r\nout to get the full benefit of the breeze, and maintain a sufficiently\r\nstraight course.\r\n\r\nThe coast was most forbidding. Rugged cliffs arose, or rocky, sterile\r\nbanks, crested with stunted spruce. Hour after hour passed by, and mile\r\nafter mile of the coast slipped away behind them, but not the slightest\r\nsign appeared of human habitation or of human life; nothing but the same\r\niron-bound shore, and the same unbroken solitude.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time they came in sight of places which were more inviting.\r\nSometimes there were shelving beaches, which appeared to be covered with\r\nsand or pebbles; at other times they saw coves, whose aspect was less\r\nforbidding than that of the bolder coast line; and on one occasion there\r\nwas a small harbor, which, in comparison with the rest of the country,\r\nwas decidedly inviting, and, if their errand had been less pressing,\r\nthey would certainly have entered it, and explored the surrounding\r\nregion. But, as it was, they passed on, noticing as they passed that\r\nhere, as everywhere else, there was not a field, not a pasture, not a\r\nclearing; that there were no signs of cattle or of man.\r\n\r\nSo passed the hours of the morning.\r\n\r\nThe sun attained its meridian, and the two voyagers thought of dinner.\r\nThe provident care of Solomon had furnished them with everything that\r\ncould be desired on such a trip as this, and the repast was not only\r\nabundant, but attractive.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what speed we have been making,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Five miles, I should think,” said Tom, “at least.”\r\n\r\n“So should I; but, then, we can’t be certain. There may be currents, or\r\nwe may be deceived in our estimate. Let’s say four, and then we’ll feel\r\ncertain. It’s after twelve now; we left at six; that’s six hours.”\r\n\r\n“Four miles an hour--little enough,” said Tom. “Well, that’s twenty-four\r\nmiles. If this sort of thing can only be kept up, we’ll get to St.\r\nPierre in no time.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the very thing,” said Arthur,--“if it can only be kept up. But\r\nI’m afraid it’s a little too good to last.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” said Tom, cheerily, “we’ll make the best of it while we\r\ncan.”\r\n\r\nArthur’s forebodings, though not based upon any ground of alarm, were,\r\nhowever, actually justified by the event, and not very long after. For\r\nscarcely had they finished their repast, when they became aware of\r\na very serious increase in the wind. A series of puffs, which almost\r\namounted to squalls, came down, and in a very short time the sea began\r\nto rise to a very unpleasant extent.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have to keep in closer,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Tom, “fortunately the wind’s off the land, and, if we can\r\nget in nearer, we’ll be all right.”\r\n\r\nBut it was not so easy to get in nearer. Tom, however, took a paddle,\r\nwhile Arthur held the boat as close to the wind as possible, and thus,\r\nin process of time, they drew her in far enough to get into smoother\r\nwater. This was not accomplished without some trifling casualties:\r\nseveral waves dashed their spray into the boat, and they shipped one\r\nsea which was heavy enough to drench them both, and leave as much as\r\na barrel full of salt water behind. This showed them what they might\r\nexpect if they dared to keep too far away from the land.\r\n\r\nThey were now close in to the shore, and they proceeded onward slowly,\r\nbut securely. It was not quite equal to their previous progress, but it\r\nwas free from danger and inconvenience.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid,” said Tom, “that we’re going to have a turn of luck.”\r\n\r\n“O, we’re doing well enough,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but we’ll be sure to come to some headland, and there we’ll stick,\r\nfor we shan’t be able to round it. This boat can’t stand any sea.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ll wait till the time comes,” said Arthur, “and not fret till\r\nthen.”\r\n\r\n“It’s lucky for us,” said Tom, “that the wind’s the way it is. If that\r\nwas a lee shore, we’d be done for.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if the wind had been any other way we shouldn’t have started,\r\nyou know,” said Arthur, “and if it changes we’ll go ashore and haul\r\nup--that’s all.”\r\n\r\n“We couldn’t find a landing-place just here very easily. I don’t think I\r\never saw a more rascally place in my life.”\r\n\r\n“It’s rather rough, I must confess,” said Arthur, “but we’ll find a\r\nbetter place before long.”\r\n\r\nThey were within an eighth of a mile from the land. It rose there in\r\nhigh, rocky cliffs, crested, as usual, with stunted trees, and fragments\r\nof rock at its base.\r\n\r\n“This seems to run on for a long way ahead,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Arthur, “but I shouldn’t wonder if behind that point ahead\r\nthe land got better. It stands to reason that these cliffs can’t extend\r\nforever. There must be places here and there where gullies occur--places\r\nwhere brooks run down, you know.”\r\n\r\n“O, I dare say; but I only hope we may get to some such a place before\r\nthe wind changes.”\r\n\r\n“Why, is the wind going to change?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. I merely supposed a case.”\r\n\r\n“O, I dare say the wind’ll keep in this direction for ever so long yet.”\r\n\r\nThey sailed along slowly under these cliffs for about a couple of miles,\r\nand at length reached the point of which Arthur had spoken. They passed\r\nthis, full of curiosity as to what lay beyond. They saw that the land\r\nhere receded for a mile or two,--very gradually, however,--while\r\nseveral miles ahead it projected itself once more into the sea, and was\r\nterminated by a precipitous headland. These receding shores showed a\r\ndifferent appearance from that of the cliffs which they had just\r\nbeen passing. They were wooded down to the water’s edge, which they\r\napproached by a gentle declivity, while about two miles ahead they\r\ndisclosed a wide area where there were no trees at all.\r\n\r\nWhether this was cultivated ground, cleared ground, or pasture, they\r\ncould not very well make out; but they had not caught sight of it before\r\nthey saw something which at once riveted their attention.\r\n\r\nIt was a column of smoke!\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” cried Tom. “We’ve come to a settlement at last. Well, it’s\r\nabout time. Hurrah! We’re all right now.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Arthur, “there must be some life about--though I can’t see\r\nany sign of any settlement.”\r\n\r\n“O, there must be a settlement somewhere about. We can’t see it yet.”\r\n\r\n“There certainly must be people, for there is the smoke.”\r\n\r\n“The settlement is farther back; away from the shore.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, or perhaps behind that headland. I dare say there’s a harbor\r\nthere, and a fishing settlement. This may be some solitary house.”\r\n\r\n“Solitary or not, it’s all the same to us. It shows us that we have come\r\nnear to human beings again.”\r\n\r\nA straight course towards the place where the smoke arose would have\r\ndrawn them into rough water; so they hugged the shore, and followed its\r\ncurve, in order to avoid the danger. For a time the smoke was concealed\r\nfrom view; but at length, as they went on, it came into sight again, and\r\nappeared twice as near as when they had first seen it. Here they saw a\r\nbeach, which ran away for a long distance; and they noticed now that the\r\nsmoke itself seemed to rise from a point on the beach about a mile away.\r\n\r\n“That’s queer,” said Tom. “The smoke can’t be from a house at all.”\r\n\r\n“No, some one has been making a fire on the beach. But it’s all the\r\nsame. It shows that people are living hereabouts, and that’s all we\r\nwant.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ll soon know.”\r\n\r\n“Tom!”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“I should laugh if this place were to turn out to be Gaspé, after all.”\r\n\r\n“O, there’s no doubt about the place. It must be Newfoundland.”\r\n\r\n“Hallo!”\r\n\r\nThis exclamation came from Arthur. He said no more, but pointed in\r\nsilence, while Tom looked eagerly in that direction.\r\n\r\nOn the beach, about a quarter of a mile away, they saw a moving figure.\r\nIt was a man. He was running along with irregular steps, waving his\r\narms in the air in a wild way, and evidently trying to attract their\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThey at once headed the boat in nearer to the shore, so as to meet him\r\nas soon as possible. As they neared the shore the man neared them. The\r\nbeach was smooth, and his staggering, irregular steps could not have\r\nbeen caused by the rough ground, while his wild gesticulations seemed\r\nunaccountable.\r\n\r\n“He must be drunk,” said Tom.\r\n\r\nArthur said nothing.\r\n\r\nThe boat grounded, and the next moment the man reached the spot. No\r\nsooner had he come up to them than he fell on his knees, and, grasping\r\nthe bows of the boat, bowed his head, and sobbed convulsively.\r\n\r\nThey saw, as he came up, that he was pale and emaciated. He was panting\r\nheavily from his exertions. He wore a flannel shirt and canvas trousers.\r\nHe looked like a common sailor from some ship, and not at all like a\r\nfisherman or farmer. The boys stared at him without saying one single\r\nword.\r\n\r\nAt length the man rose and looked at them with a searching and curious\r\ngaze.\r\n\r\n“A couple o? youngsters,” said he at last, as though speaking to\r\nhimself. “Queer, too--youngsters! Say, boys, is your ship near by?”\r\n\r\n“Not very.”\r\n\r\n“Where do you come from?”\r\n\r\n“O, from over there,” said Arthur. “The fact is, we got ashore.”\r\n\r\n“Got ashore!”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and we’ve come here to look up some settlement.”\r\n\r\n“Got ashore! settlement!” said the man.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Arthur. “And we’d like to go, as soon as possible, to the\r\nnearest settlement. We want to engage a schooner to go back with us and\r\nget our friends.”\r\n\r\nAt this the man stared at them for a few moments in a wild way, and then\r\nburst forth into laughter so strange and so wild that both the boys felt\r\nuncomfortable. Tom began to think that he was not drunk, but insane, and\r\nfelt sorry that they had allowed the boat to touch the shore.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the man stopped, and looked at them with a totally different\r\nexpression. He looked at them fixedly, and there was on his face a\r\ncertain pity and commiseration which struck them forcibly.\r\n\r\n“Boys,” said he at length, in a gentle voice, “you’re on the lookout for\r\na settlement, are you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, look at me. Now look at all this country. Well, I’m the only\r\nsettler here. I’m the only settler you’ll ever find here, if you sail a\r\nhundred years. Do you know where you’ve got to?”\r\n\r\n“Why, we thought it was Newfoundland,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“Or Gaspé,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\nThe man looked at them with a solemn face for some time, and said not a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n“Poor boys! poor boys!” he murmured at last; “p’raps they was worse\r\noff’n I was. An air you all alone, boys?”\r\n\r\n“No; we’ve left our friends some, miles back.”\r\n\r\n“O, an you thought you was on Newfoundland coast, or Gaspé, an you goes\r\noff to hunt for help, an you leaves your friends. Well, now, have they\r\ngot lots to eat?”\r\n\r\n“O, yes.”\r\n\r\n“Lots?” repeated the man, with some energy. “Lots, now, railly?”\r\n\r\n“Plenty--enough to last them for a year.”\r\n\r\nThe man sighed.\r\n\r\n“An so you comes off for help. Why did they let you youngsters go? Why\r\ndidn’t the men go?”\r\n\r\n“O, we’re all boys,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s queer, too.”\r\n\r\n“A kind of pleasure party,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\nThe man shook his head mournfully.\r\n\r\n“An so you thinks you’ve got onto Newfoundland or Gaspé,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Why? Where are we? Can you tell us? And who are you? and what are\r\nyou doing here?”\r\n\r\nTom said this.\r\n\r\n“Me?” said the man. “Look at me. Can’t you see what I be? Do I look\r\nlike a gentleman farmer? Is this the country for a emigrant? Me!” he\r\nrepeated, with a bitter laugh. “Poor boys! poor boys! Why, I’m jest like\r\nyou. I’m ship-wracked--on’y I knows where I be, an that’s more’n you do,\r\nit seems.”\r\n\r\n“Shipwrecked!” exclaimed Tom.\r\n\r\n“Yes, wracked--the worst sort; an this here country--so you think it’s\r\nNewfoundland or Gaspé? Well--it ain’t either.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“The worst place in the world--that’s what it is; a place where there\r\nain’t no hope, and there ain’t no life. It’s only death that a man can\r\nfind here.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” asked Tom. “Tell us what place it is.”\r\n\r\nThe man looked at them both, one after the other, with a solemn face.\r\n\r\n“I been ship wracked,” said he, “an I been here more’n a fortnight; an\r\nthis here place is--Anticosti!”\r\n\r\n“Anticosti!” exclaimed both the boys, exchanging glances of horror,\r\nwhile a feeling of despair came over them.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the man, “this here country’s Anticosti--un woe to the poor\r\nwretch that’s cast ashore here. For there ain’t no life here, an there\r\nain’t no hope, an there ain’t no food; an the only thing a man can do is\r\nto lie down an die as fast as he can.”\r\n\r\nA long silence followed. The boys felt utterly overwhelmed. They had\r\nall heard enough about Anticosti to make the name one of dread, and to\r\nsurround it with the darkest gloom and the most formidable terrors.\r\n\r\n“We thought,” said Arthur, at length, to the man, who seemed to be\r\nlost in his own thoughts, “we supposed that we were on the coast of\r\nNewfoundland, somewhere between Cape Ray and Fortune’s Bay; so we\r\nstarted off to sail along the coast in search of a settlement, and if we\r\ncouldn’t find any we intended to go to St. Pierre.”\r\n\r\n“This is Anticosti,” said the man.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Arthur, gravely, “we’ll suppose it is. So much the\r\nmore need for us to help our friends. You appear to have had a hard time\r\nof it; but you’re a sailor, and we are not. You can help us. It seems\r\nto me that you can do a great deal for us. I think we had better keep to\r\nour plan, and try to reach the nearest settlement. If it is St. Pierre,\r\nor the Bay of Islands, or any other place, perhaps you can tell us.\r\nAt any rate, you can sail the boat, and we can’t. We’ve got lots of\r\nprovisions here; so you’d better come with us, and help us to reach some\r\nplace where we can get assistance for our friends.”\r\n\r\nWhile Arthur was saying this, the man stared at him most intently.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he at last, as Arthur ceased, “you’re about the pluckiest\r\nlot in the way of boys that I’ve come across for some time. All I can\r\nsay is, you needn’t beat round the bush with me. You’ve saved my life,\r\nand so you’ll find that Dick Bailey is yours till death. All you’ve got\r\nto do, boys, is to tell what you want done, and I’ll do it--if it can be\r\ndone. But fust and foremost, let me tell you ’tain’t no use tryin to\r\nget any further in that there boat this day, for the wind’s risin, and\r\nyou’d best come ashore till it blows over. We’ll take the boat up high\r\nand dry out of harm’s way, and then we can talk over what we’d best do.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t we go any farther to-day?” asked Arthur, in a disappointed tone.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bailey,--“no, you can’t go either for’ard or back’ard, for\r\nit’s a head wind one way, and the other way is barred by that there\r\npint. So, as I said afore, you’d better land. We’ll draw the boat up\r\nhigh an dry out of harm’s way, and we’ll wait till to-morrer. By that\r\ntime there’ll be a change for the better.”\r\n\r\nUpon this Arthur and Tom got out, and the three drew the boat up as far\r\nas they could upon the beach.\r\n\r\n“There,” said Bailey, “she’s out of harm’s way, unless a sou’-wester\r\ncomes; an if it does, we can move her up further. But there ain’t no\r\nchance of that. And now, boys, hain’t you got something to give a poor\r\nfeller to eat that’s been starvin for a fortnight?”\r\n\r\nUpon this appeal Arthur and Tom at once laid open all their stores,\r\nproducing biscuit, ham, potted meats, and all the other articles of food\r\nwhich comprised their sea stores.\r\n\r\nAnd the shipwrecked Bailey ate ravenously; ate, in fact, as though he\r\nwould never be satisfied.\r\n\r\n“I ain’t had,” said he, as soon as he found time to speak in the\r\nintervals of eating,--“I ain’t had not to say a reg’lar meal for three\r\nweeks, which accounts for my present ravenosity, an hopin you’ll excuse\r\nit, young gents.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\n_Bailey’s Den.--The Fire.--The blazing Beacon.--Shell Fish.--Bailey\r\nbegins his Narrative.--Astonishing Disclosure.--Mutual Explanations.\r\n--The Story of Bailey.--The Crank Ship.--Springing aleak.--The mutinous\r\nCrew.--A Storm.--Taking to the Boats.--The Captain sticks to his\r\nShip.--Driving before the Wind.--Cast ashore.--How to kindle a\r\nFire.--Plans for the Future.--The Evening Repast.--The insatiable\r\nAppetite of a half starved Man.--Asleep in Bailey’s Den._\r\n\r\n\r\nAT length Bailey’s hunger seemed somewhat appeased. “I’m a thinkin,”\r\n said he, “as how we’d better take these here victuals to some place\r\nwhere it’ll be more under cover, and handy for us about tea time. If\r\nyou like, I’ll take them to my den.”\r\n\r\n“But can’t we roll it farther up? This barrel’s too heavy to take any\r\ndistance.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’ know but what you’re more’n half right. I didn’t think of\r\nthe bar’l. Leastways, we can put it further up, out of the reach of any\r\nsurf, and cover it with the sail.”\r\n\r\n“We can take with us as much as we may be likely to want,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said the man, “there ain’t no fear of anybody stealin the things\r\nhere; and as the wind ain’t likely to turn yet a while, I don’t s’pose\r\nthere’ll be any danger of surf.”\r\n\r\nAfter a few further precautions, so as to secure the boat and the\r\ncontents from any possible harm, Bailey set off to show the boys his\r\n“den.” They walked along the beach for about half a mile, and then\r\nstopped at a place where a high rock jutted out. Behind this there was\r\na recess about twenty feet above the beach, formed by a fissure in the\r\nrock. A huge mass overhead shut it in, and formed a sort of roof; while\r\nthe lower portion had been filled up by crumbled fragments. Over this\r\nrough floor Bailey had spread spruce brush, ferns, and mosses, so that\r\nit was soft enough to lie down on. The whole recess was about eight feet\r\ndeep, six feet wide, and six feet high. Immediately outside a fire was\r\nburning, and from this came the smoke which had first attracted their\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n“I keep that there burnin,” said Bailey, “night and day, an I’ve kept\r\nit a burnin for the last fortnight. There’s drift-wood enough along the\r\nbeach here, though every day I have to go further away to get it. Wal,\r\nthere’s wood enough on the island, if it comes to that, only ‘tain’t\r\neasy gittin it up in the woods.”\r\n\r\nThe boys looked around with deep interest, and with varied feelings.\r\nThey saw outside, by the fire, heaps of shells, which seemed to have\r\nbeen burned.\r\n\r\n“Thar,” said Bailey, “them’s all I’ve had to eat, every bite, since I\r\nlanded here. They do to keep body and soul together, but they ain’t much\r\naccount. I’d give a bushel any day for one good biscuit. What I’ve jest\r\neat seems to have made a man of me.”\r\n\r\nThe boys were silent for some time, and at length Arthur asked,--\r\n\r\n“How did you happen to get here?”\r\n\r\n“Wal, I’ll tell you all about it,” said Bailey.\r\n\r\n“I’ll begin at the beginnin. Wal, you see, about five weeks ago I\r\nshipped aboard the Petrel, at Quebec--”\r\n\r\n“The what?” cried Arthur and Tom, in the greatest wonder and excitement.\r\n\r\n“The ship Petrel,” said Bailey. “Why, what of her?”\r\n\r\n“The Petrel!” cried Arthur. “What, the ship Petrel, of Liverpool-?”\r\n\r\n“That there’s the identical craft.”\r\n\r\n“And--and--and,” stammered Tom, in his excitement, “was--was her\r\ncaptain’s name Henry Hall? and--and was she loaded with timber?”\r\n\r\n“And didn’t she get water-logged?” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and didn’t the captain and crew all leave her?”\r\n\r\nBailey stared at the boys with astonishment fully equal to their own.\r\n\r\n“You seem to know all about her,” said he, slowly; “and how you larned\r\nall that beats me.”\r\n\r\n“Why, that’s the very ship that we got wrecked on, too,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Tom; “we were sailing about, and found her adrift, and all\r\nas comfortable as possible.”\r\n\r\n“We tried to be salvors,” said Arthur; “and we were left on board to\r\ntake care of her while our captain went off in the schooner for help.”\r\n\r\n“And he anchored her, and the anchor didn’t hold,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“And we drifted all about the gulf,” continued Arthur, “and were out\r\nin the most horrible gales that ever were, till finally we got ashore\r\nhere.” The boys poured out this information in the most rapid manner\r\npossible upon the astounded Bailey, who now seemed fairly struck dumb.\r\n\r\n“You--in the Petrel!” he exclaimed, at length, in slow and perplexed\r\ntones. “You--you adrift in that water-logged craft! and thrown by that\r\nthere ship here on Anticosti!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Arthur, briskly, “that’s just it.” Bailey raised his hand\r\nslowly to his head, and scratched it solemnly, raising his eyes at the\r\nsame time, and fixing them upon empty space.\r\n\r\n“These here two young coves in the Petrel! and hev ashore on Anticosti!”\r\n he murmured.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” said Arthur; “and now tell us all about how you got here.”\r\n\r\nBailey started, and looked at each of them silently and solemnly; then\r\nhe looked away, as before.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said he, at last, “this here--doos--beat--my--grandmother! Wal,\r\nI’ll tell my story, an then I’ll listen to yourn, an we’ll compare\r\nnotes, an in that way we’ll grad’ly get the hang of it; for jest now, as\r\nthings is, I’m dumfounded.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” continued Bailey, after a pause, “I’ll start afresh. I shipped\r\nthen, as I was a sayin, as able seaman, aboard the Petrel. She was\r\nloaded down deep with timber, an badly loaded, too, for as she lay in\r\nthe stream at Quebec, she had a list ever so far over.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I was overly sober when I was took on board, an I don’t\r\nthink any of the other men was overly sober, neither; at any rate, the\r\nfirst thing I knows, I finds myself thirty mile below Quebec, aboard the\r\nPetrel, that had a list to one side that would almost let a man foot it\r\nup her masts.\r\n\r\n“The first thing we all does, we all begins to kick up a dust. The mate\r\nhe swears we ain’t goin to sail the ship. Crank? Why, crank ain’t the\r\nword! Wal, the captain he tells us we’re gettin up mutiny, and warns us.\r\nAnd we tells him to look at the ship.\r\n\r\n“Wal, things goes on somehow, and we gets down the river further, we\r\ngrumblin all the way and the mate a swearin. One night she drifts nigh\r\nto the shore and touches. We gets her off somehow; but she got a bad\r\nsprain, and begins to leak.\r\n\r\n“Wal, we all growls and grumbles, and won’t touch the pumps; and the\r\ncaptain he threatens, and the mate he rows and swears, and the captain\r\nhe vows, leak or no leak, he’ll put that there ship across the Atlantic.\r\nAt last things grows worse, and the mate one day puts a couple of us in\r\nthe bilboes.\r\n\r\n“Wal, that only makes things worse; and by that time we was in the gulf,\r\nand rough weather comes on, and none of us would touch a line. So the\r\ncaptain he knocks under, and lets the men go, and promises us a glass\r\nof grog all round if we’ll bear a hand at the pumps. But we insists\r\non putting the deck-load overboard first. The captain wouldn’t do it,\r\nthough, for ever so long; till at last the wind blew a gale, and the\r\ncranky vessel plunged under so, and strained and twisted so, that at\r\nlast he was glad enough to do it of his own accord. So we all goes to\r\nwork in the midst of that there gale, and puts every stick over. They\r\nwasn’t much--only deals, and easy handled. It was timber below, and if\r\nit had been timber on deck, we couldn’t have done it nohow.\r\n\r\n“Wal, that gale went on, and another followed, and we all pumped away\r\nfor dear life, but didn’t do much. It had got to be a little too late;\r\nand what with the first touch on the rocks, and the straining and\r\ntwisting afterwards, the leak got to be a little the biggest I ever did\r\nsee.\r\n\r\n“So it went from bad to worse. We all worked at last like the old boy.\r\nNo need then for the captain to encourage us. We worked for dear\r\nlife without bein told. But the leak gained steadily, and the storm\r\nincreased. At last every rag of sail was blown off, and the ship was\r\nwater-logged, and we all had to take refuge in the riggin. We saw what\r\nwas comin in time to get the boats up out of harm’s way, for the water\r\nwas rollin over the deck so that you couldn’t tell which was the ship\r\nand which was the sea. We were for puttin off and abandonin of her; but\r\nthe captain he swore she never could sink, bein timber-laden, and said\r\nthe storm would soon blow over, and we’d put into Miramichi. So we hung\r\non as long as we could.\r\n\r\n“At last the vessel strained so that we all was sure and certain that\r\nshe was goin to pieces; so we determined to save ourselves; so we got\r\ndown the long-boat, and managed, one by one, to get into her as she\r\nfloated to leeward, and then begged the captain and mate to follow. The\r\nmate seemed half inclined, but the captain was obstinate. He swore he\r\nwould stick to the ship, and save her yet. He begged us to come back,\r\nand told us she would float till doomsday. But we swore she was break-in\r\nup, and told him she couldn’t hang together one day more.\r\n\r\n“The worst of it was, all this time we didn’t know where we was. There\r\nwas fog and heavy-gales, and the captain hadn’t taken no reckonin for\r\nweeks. We wanted to git off the wreck before she got onto the rocks. As\r\nfor the captain and mate, they had the cutter, and a couple of the men\r\nstaid behind to take off the cutter, and the captain and mate, too, if\r\nthey should come to their senses, leastways the mate. And what became of\r\nthem four I hain’t no idee.\r\n\r\n“Wal, then we dropped off, and went away in the long-boat. We hadn’t\r\nno idee where we was, and couldn’t tell the pints of the compass. We\r\nthought the best thing would be to run before the wind, since we didn’t\r\nknow any better way, and we knew we was somewhere in the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence, and would fetch up at last somewheres. So we let her run, and\r\nkept a sharp lookout, or tried to, though ’twan’t no use at night,\r\nfor what with the darkness and the fog, the nights was that dark you\r\ncouldn’t see the nose before your face. Well, that’s all. The only thing\r\nmore that I know is this--that one night I was sound asleep, and was\r\nwaked up by a tremenjous yell, and found myself in the water. The boat\r\nhad been thrown on rocks or surf, and had capsized. I struggled, and at\r\nlast found bottom, and rushed blindly along, I couldn’t see where, till\r\nI got to dry ground. And it was this here beach; and afterwards, as\r\nI found out how the wind was blowin, and put this an that together, I\r\nconcluded that this was Anticosti, and now I know it.”\r\n\r\nSo ended Bailey’s narrative. A long conversation followed. The boys were\r\nanxious to know why he felt so sure that it was Anticosti, and Bailey\r\ndescribed his theory of the position of the Petrel at the time he left\r\nher, and the course which the boat must have taken in such a wind. He\r\nalso felt sure, from the character of the coast and the country, that\r\nit was this place, and no other. Then the boys gave a minute account\r\nof their own adventures. Bailey was most struck by the captain’s paper\r\nfound in the bottle.\r\n\r\n“Wal,” said he, “he stood it as long as he could; but I dar say, arter\r\nwe cleared out, he begun to feel a little shaky. And that thar ship did\r\nshake herself up in a way that beat everythin I ever see in all my born\r\ndays. I was as sure that she was breakin up as I was of my own name. So\r\nthe captain he thought, no doubt, that it wan’t wuth while to die for\r\nthe sake of an old timber ship, or p’raps the mate and the sailors\r\npressed him, and so off he goes; or p’raps some passing vessel hove in\r\nsight, and took him off. But only think of you youngsters happenin on\r\nboard, and goin through the same identical fortin that I went\r\nthrough, and then us meetin this way in Anticosti! It\r\ndoos--beat--my--grandmother! It--doos--railly.”\r\n\r\nThe question now arose what was best to be done. Of course the fact that\r\nthis was Anticosti changed the whole state of things.\r\n\r\n“You see if this was railly Newfoundland,” said Bailey, “we might sail\r\neast, and event’ly git to some settlement; but if we try that now, we’ll\r\nhave to go all along past the worst coast in the world, and then we’d\r\nget to East Pint; and what then? Why, the gulf. So we’ve got to turn\r\nabout, and go back in the other direction.”\r\n\r\n“What? West?”...\r\n\r\n“Yes, away west, or sou’-west. I’ve heard tell of some settlement at\r\nWest Pint, the other end of the island; but I hain’t no idee whether\r\nit’s kep up yet or not. At any rate, there’s Gaspé. ‘Tain’t far off. We\r\ncan crawl along the shore, and then cut across to Gaspé, and get help.”\r\n\r\n“But we’ll go back first to where we left the boys.”\r\n\r\n“Course, that’s the first thing; and then your vyge ends, and we’ve got\r\nto arrange a fresh one.”\r\n\r\n“Well, can we start to-day?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“To-day? No, sir! Look at me! Why, I’d give anythin to git away from\r\nthis here place! Think of me here for two long weeks, livin on shell\r\nfish, pacin up and down the beach, and keepin my signal-fire a burnin\r\nall the time, and feelin myself every day gradooly growin ravin mad!\r\nThink what I’ve ben an suffered here! Yet I wouldn’t leave to-day,\r\n’cos it’s goin to blow harder, and that there cockle-shell don’t do to\r\nbeat against a wind like this.”\r\n\r\n“But can’t we row?”\r\n\r\n“You hain’t got no oars.”\r\n\r\n“There are those in the boat.”\r\n\r\n“Them things! Them’s poles, or paddles; do to push the boat a little way\r\nthrough smooth water, but not with the wind this way. No; we’ve got to\r\nwait.”\r\n\r\nArthur and Tom both felt the force of this, and urged the point no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see,” said Arthur, “how you managed to light a fire.”\r\n\r\n“O, with my jackknife and a bit of flint,” said Bailey. “No trouble to\r\nget flint hereabouts. I got some cotton wool out of the paddin of my\r\ncollar, and some dry moss, and coaxed some sparks into a blaze. O, you\r\ngive me a knife, and I’ll draw fire out of any stone anywhars. The night\r\nI was drove ashore, I crept somewhar under the cliff, and staid there\r\ntill mornin, and in the mornin the first thing I doos is to kindle a\r\nfire. I found the drift-wood, and this seemed to be the best place. Sea\r\nshells isn’t the best fare in the world, and sick am I of all sorts and\r\nkinds of shell fish; but glad was I when I lit on them that first day,\r\nwhen I walked about nearly starved. If it hadn’t ben for them thar\r\nshells it would ha’ ben all over with me. That’s so. And this here\r\nden wasn’t a bad place, considerin. In fact, I ben a lucky man in some\r\nthings, seein that this is Anticosti, and fust and foremost, that I got\r\noff with my life; for every one of the rest was drownded, and I’ve never\r\nseen even a splinter of the boat since.”\r\n\r\nThe recollection of this gloomy event reduced Bailey for a time to\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon passed away. The wind increased. The sea grew rougher, and\r\nevery hour served to increase the impossibility of a return that day.\r\nBut the boys had already resigned themselves to this, and therefore\r\nawaited the evening, and looked forward to the night with calmness and\r\nin patience.\r\n\r\nAt sunset the evening repast was spread out, and Bailey showed his usual\r\nravenous appetite.\r\n\r\n“’Pears to me, boys,” said he, apologetically, “jest as if I couldn’t\r\never git enough to eat again. You’ll have to make allowances for a man\r\nas has been starvin for three weeks.”\r\n\r\nAfter tea they made their preparations for the night. First they went\r\nto see that the boat was safe, and to make doubly sure, they hauled her\r\nfarther up the beach. Then they collected a quantity of drift-wood, with\r\nwhich they replenished their fire.\r\n\r\n“Thar,” said Bailey, “if so be as any vessel does pass by, they’ll be\r\nsure to see this here light, and they’ll know precious well as how some\r\nunfortunate coves is shipwrecked here, and is a signalin for help. But,\r\nmisfortunately, I ben a lookin for-ard every night for help, and it\r\nnever would come.”\r\n\r\n“It was your signal that drew us in,” said Arthur. “It was a success by\r\nday, at any rate.”\r\n\r\nThey talked and meditated for another hour or so, and watched the\r\nblazing flames till they were tired.\r\n\r\nThen they all spread themselves out in Bailey’s “den,” and fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\n_The Denizens of Bailey’s Den--Morning.--A Sail upon the Surface of the\r\nSea.--The Spyglass.--Exciting Discovery to the lost Ones.--The strange\r\nSchooner.--Exchange of Signals.--The Excitement increases.--The Schooner\r\ndraws nearer.--New Signals.--They take to the Boat.--Out to Sea.--Rough\r\nWater.--Another Sail.--A strange Suspicion.--Old Friends.--Pleasant\r\nGreetings.--Mrs. Corbet.--Obloquy heaped upon the Antelope and its\r\nvenerable Commander.--Away to the Rescue._\r\n\r\n\r\nBAILEY’S den was a particularly well sheltered recess in the rock, open\r\nto no wind, except a sou’-wester. The wind that blew while Bailey and\r\nhis guests slumbered inside, came from the north-west, and therefore the\r\nsleepers knew nothing of it. Out in the sea, indeed, the waters felt\r\nits power, and the foaming waves on the following morning told them the\r\nstory of the night; but during that night they knew nothing at all about\r\nit. Far down the side of the cliff, under the rocky precipice, out of\r\nthe way of the wind, the occupants of Bailey’s den slumbered on the soft\r\nspruce brush and softer moss. All night long the fire burned outside,\r\nfor Bailey had piled up the fuel generously, yet carefully, and had so\r\narranged it, by making alternate layers of green wood and dry, that it\r\nwould burn all night long, and yet send forth sufficient flame to be\r\nvisible at sea.\r\n\r\nMorning came, and the wind and sea had gone down. Upon rising, the\r\ndenizens of Bailey’s den looked forth upon the water, and saw that it\r\nwas very much the same as it had been on the preceding day. At this\r\nArthur and Tom shook their heads, but Bailey was sanguine, and spoke\r\nencouragingly.\r\n\r\n“The wind has hauled round a pint or two,” said he, “and I shouldn’t\r\nwonder if it was to come round a little more; and if so, it’ll be\r\nall right for us. A moderate north or north-east wind’ll be jest the\r\ncheese.”\r\n\r\nThey now replenished the fire, after which they sat down to their\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\n“So you got all this out of the Petrel,” said Bailey. “Well, only\r\nthink! Why, what gormandizers them captains an mates in the cabin must\r\nbe--feedin on potted meats! an only think what we eats before the mast!\r\nHard tack, salt junk, an dish-water, that’s what we eats before the\r\nmast; but aft, my gentlemen won’t be satisfied with nothin less than\r\nYorkshire game pie, and Oxford sassage--and, what’s this?--Bolony\r\nsassage, an all them other condyments what you’ve got done up in them\r\nthere tin pots. Wall, they’re precious good eatin on a desert island,\r\nwhatever they be in a ship’s cabin, only they seem most too good for the\r\nlikes of me.”\r\n\r\n“You?” said Arthur. “Why, you have a better right to them than we have;\r\nfor we haven’t any right at all. And, as to the Petrel, if you can\r\nmanage to save her, I hereby agree to deliver up and surrender to you.\r\nall my right, title, and interest in and to any part or portion of the\r\nso-called salvage.”\r\n\r\n“And I too,” said Tom, chiming in with the utmost gravity; “and hereby\r\nmake known by these presents, to all whom it may concern, and anything\r\nto the contrary hereof in any wise notwithstanding.”\r\n\r\nBailey was evidently much impressed by these legal formulas. He bowed\r\nvery gravely.\r\n\r\n“Your servant, young gents, and my ’umble dooty to both of you; but,\r\nat the same time, I don’t want any more’n fair an honest wages, and, if\r\nso be as you ain’t in the position to give it, why, well and good, says\r\nI; but, if so be as you can, why, I’ll take what’s fair, and right, and\r\nlawful, and no more--”\r\n\r\nBut at this point this interesting conversation was abruptly terminated\r\nby a loud cry from Tom. His eyes were fixed upon the sea, and were\r\nfascinated by something there.\r\n\r\n“A sail! a sail!” he cried. “A sail! O, a sail! Look, look, look!”\r\n\r\nArthur and Bailey sprang to their feet, and looked in the direction\r\nwhere Tom was pointing. Tom seized the spy-glass, wrhich they had\r\nbrought into the den, and examined more closely, while Arthur and Bailey\r\nwatched the distant sea.\r\n\r\nAnd there, on the distant sea, several miles away, a sail appeared,\r\nunmistakably. It was a schooner, and she was not more than five miles\r\naway.\r\n\r\n“She’s heading away from us,” said Tom; “she’s going away, out to sea.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be too hasty,” said Bailey; “she may p’raps be only beatin up\r\nagin this here wrind. It’s a head wind for her.”\r\n\r\n“I wish it may turn out so,” said Tom.\r\n\r\nThey now watched in silence for some time longer. The schooner held\r\non her way steadily. At length she tacked, and, wearing round, headed\r\ntowards the shore.\r\n\r\n“I knowed it!” said Bailey, triumphantly. “She’s a coastin along, and is\r\nbeatin up agin the wind. Just hand us that there glass for a minute, if\r\nyou please, and let us git a squint at her.”\r\n\r\nTom handed the glass to Bailey, who took it, and looked at the schooner\r\nlong and carefully.\r\n\r\nAt length he returned it to Tom. “It’s a fisher,” said he; “a Yankee\r\nfisher. I knows the cut of her jib; there’s no mistakin her.\r\nYou don’t find any of yer Province fishermen git up such a turnout\r\nas that there. Why, she’s a cross between the best class of Liverpool\r\npilot-boat and a nobleman’s yacht; and I don’t believe there’s a\r\npilot-boat or a yacht afloat that can lick that there fisherman in a\r\nfair race.”\r\n\r\nArthur now took the glass, and looked at her long and earnestly.\r\n\r\n“I say, Tom,” said he.\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Do you know what I’m thinking?”\r\n\r\n“I dare say it’s the very thought that I had.”\r\n\r\n“What? The Fawn?”\r\n\r\n“The very thing.”\r\n\r\n“Of course it’s all nonsense. I suppose all the Yankee fishermen, or,\r\nat any rate, a great many, are just like the Fawn; but, at any rate,\r\nwouldn’t it be fun if it should turn out to be her?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s too much to hope for,” said Tom; “it’ll be fun enough for me\r\nif she only takes us off--if she only sees us. Hadn’t we better pile on\r\nmore fuel, Bailey?”\r\n\r\n“No; ’tain’t no use. The fire’s makin as much smoke as it can, an\r\nthat’s the best thing by daytime. If that there vessel’s beatin up the\r\ncoast, she’s bound to see us on the next tack, if she don’t see us\r\nnow; and it’ll only take three more tacks to bring her right\r\nopposite--Hallo!”\r\n\r\nAn abrupt exclamation terminated Bailey’s remarks. He seized the glass\r\nwithout a word of apology, and took a hasty glance.\r\n\r\n“They’re a histin an a lowerin of the flag! They’re a signalizing, as\r\nsure as I’m a born sinner! and to us! Hooray!”\r\n\r\nThis Bailey shouted, quite beside himself, and then dropping the\r\nspy-glass, at the imminent risk of its destruction, he seized a pole\r\nthat lay near, and scattered the fire about in all directions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0325]\r\n\r\n“I’m a tryin to answer their signals,” said he. “They see us! They know\r\nthat were a signalizin to them, and they’re a tellin us that they’ll be\r\nalong! Hooray!”\r\n\r\nThe schooner now tacked, and stood out to sea.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Bailey; “the next tack’ll bring her nearer.”\r\n\r\nThis reassured the boys, who did not like even the appearance of\r\ndesertion. They watched her now in silence, and at length had the\r\ngratification of seeing her taking her next tack, and standing in\r\ntowards the shore. This time she was very much nearer. Bailey rushed\r\noff, and gathered a quantity of dry spruce twigs and moss. As the\r\nschooner neared the shore, her flag rose and fell rapidly, and the\r\nreport of a rifle sounded over the waters. At this Bailey flung his\r\nmoss and spruce twigs upon the fire, and a vast cloud of smoke shot up,\r\nintermingled with sparks and flame.\r\n\r\n“We’re gradooly a comin to a understandin,” said Bailey, as he rubbed\r\nhis hands in immense glee, and watched the schooner. “And I do believe\r\nthat the next tack’ll bring her here. Boys, let’s get ready with the\r\nboat.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, Bailey hurried down, followed by the boys. They hurried\r\nas fast as possible to the boat, and began to launch her. As she was\r\nuncommonly high and dry, this was a work of time; but it was at length\r\naccomplished, and the boat was afloat.\r\n\r\nThe wind was still off the land, to a certain extent, and the water had\r\nbecome far smoother. Besides, for a quarter of a mile or so from the\r\nland, it had never been much affected by the wind. They were too eager\r\nto wait, and so in a short time the sail was up, and Bailey, at the\r\nstern, headed the boat so as to meet the schooner on her return tack.\r\nAs the wind caught the sail, the boat moved through the water, at\r\nfirst slowly, but gradually more swiftly. While the boat moved out, the\r\nschooner seemed to be sailing away, and leaving them behind; but this\r\ngave them no trouble, for they knew that before long she would wear\r\nround, and come to meet them. And so, with eager eyes, they watched her,\r\nand waited impatiently for the moment when she would turn.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Arthur gave a cry, and pointed down the coast. There, as they\r\nlooked, to their great amazement, they saw another sail, far away,\r\nemerging from the land, and standing out to sea.\r\n\r\n“Wall--this--doos--beat--my--grandmother!” cried Bailey. “Or, in other\r\nwords, boys, it never rains but it pours. We’ll have the whole fishing\r\nfleet yet.”\r\n\r\nArthur and Tom said nothing. Tom seized the glass, and looked for a few\r\nminutes. Then he handed it to Arthur in silence.\r\n\r\nArthur looked for some time most earnestly and most curiously.\r\n\r\n“It’s queer!” said he.\r\n\r\n“What?” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe there’s another vessel in the world like that.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think that?” said Tom. “It’s the very idea that I had.”\r\n\r\n“What! Not the Antelope?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; the Antelope--her own very old self.”\r\n\r\n“The Antelope!” cried Bailey. “You don’t mean it. If it is her, then\r\nit’s all explained. So he’s come arter you--has he? So that’s it.\r\nWal, it’s the least he could do, arter gittin you into such a precious\r\nscrape.”\r\n\r\n“O, it’s only a fancy. It mayn’t be her, after all.”\r\n\r\n“O, but to my mind, it’s more likely to be her than any one else. No one\r\nbut a friend, in search of a friend, would ever think of beatin up this\r\nhere way along the coast of Anticosti. That’s my idee.” This assurance\r\nof Bailey’s tended to strengthen the idea which the boys had formed.\r\nAfter all, it was not impossible; nay, they thought it was not even\r\nimprobable; for had they not been on the lookout for this very Antelope?\r\nand what vessel was more likely to come after them than this one? and\r\nwhy should she not come even to Anticosti?\r\n\r\n“There she comes!” cried Bailey.\r\n\r\nIt was the fishing schooner. She was tacking. She wore round easily and\r\ngracefully, and headed straight towards them. They saw her draw nearer\r\nand nearer every moment, her bows rising, and tossing the water aside in\r\nshowers of spray. They also stood boldly out now, for Bailey was at the\r\nhelm, and was a far different sailor from Arthur or Tom. The little boat\r\nplunged soon into the rough water, and occasionally a torrent of foam\r\ndashed on board; but this was nothing, for all their eyes and all their\r\nthoughts were centred upon the approaching schooner.\r\n\r\nAt length they met--the schooner driving through the sea under a cloud\r\nof canvas. There was a man at the bow--a well-known form--the form of\r\nCaptain Tobias Ferguson. The graceful Fawn wore round; the boat came\r\nup; a line was thrown, and Bailey seized it. The boys clambered up her\r\nsides, and the instant they reached her deck, they found themselves\r\nseized by Ferguson, who said, in a voice broken by agitation,--“Hooray!\r\nWe’ve got--we’ve got you--at--at last! Where are the others? Why didn’t\r\nthey come off too?”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Arthur. “They are all safe in a cove about twenty\r\nmiles west of this.”\r\n\r\nThen followed a torrent of questions from Ferguson, which the boys\r\nanswered. Their answers brought peace to his soul, for it appeared that\r\nhe had been full of terror at the coming of these two, and two only,\r\nand had feared that they were bringing some disastrous tidings about the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe boat was towed astern. Bailey was welcomed right royally, as was\r\nbefitting one whom the boys introduced as their friend. At length the\r\nmind of Captain Tobias Ferguson was at rest; and the Fawn, rounding on\r\nanother tack, stood out to sea, on her way towards the cove, where the\r\nrest of the party were encamped.\r\n\r\n“But you haven’t told us how you heard about us,” said Arthur, as soon\r\nas he had a chance to ask a question.\r\n\r\nFerguson seized his arm, and pointed over the water to the sail that\r\nArthur and Tom had already noticed.\r\n\r\n“Do you see that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; that schooner?”\r\n\r\n“No; that tub, that wash-basin, that horse-trough, anything but a\r\nschooner. Well, do you know what that is?”\r\n\r\n“The Antelope?” suggested Tom.\r\n\r\n“Yes; that’s what she is called by her commander--that old woman, Mrs.\r\nCorbet, Mrs. Captain Corbet--old woman! Why, I can find fifty old women\r\ndown our way that would take better care of a vessel than him--_her_, I\r\nmean. Well, boys, I was at Magdalen Islands when Mrs. Corbet came there\r\nin her wash-tub. I felt uneasy about you; knew something had happened;\r\nasked him--_her_, I mean--all about it; but Mrs. Corbet wouldn’t answer.\r\nWell, I followed her. I was bound to see what had become of you. And\r\nwhere do you think that old woman went? Where? Why, to Miramichi! Well,\r\nI followed her there and back, and come up to her, to find her in the\r\nmiddle of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, at her wit’s end; for she had come\r\nthere thinking that you would be anchored there, and waiting for her.\r\nNow, what do you think of that for an Old Woman?”\r\n\r\nThe boys were very much surprised at this, and questioned him more\r\nclosely. At first they thought that he was too hard on the venerable\r\ncaptain; but when they learned how the venerable captain had actually\r\ngone all the way to Miramichi, leaving them in their perilous position,\r\nthey thought that the V. C., aforesaid, had gone too far, and that he\r\nmerited all the contumely which Ferguson heaped so lavishly upon him.\r\n\r\n“Anybody else,” he continued,--“anybody else but me, Tobias Ferguson,\r\nwould simply have gone mad at trying to keep that old woman and her tub\r\nin sight. It’s taken two days to do what might have been done in one.\r\nI’ve sailed back a dozen times to keep her in sight; and look at her\r\nnow! There she is, losing as much as she gains at every tack; standing\r\nstill, as I’m a living sinner. I sailed off, that very day I was telling\r\nyou about, for Anticosti, and got to East Point. There I waited for Mrs.\r\nCorbet, inspecting the coast at odd times, and it was nearly the end of\r\nthe next day before she came up; and even then I had to sail back ever\r\nso far to find her. Then we began to beat up along the coast, against\r\nthe wind, watching all the time, not only the shore, but Mrs. Corbet.\r\nAnd there she is! At any rate, I won’t bother about her any longer. I’ll\r\nhurry up to the cove to get the rest of the boys, and let Mrs. Corbet\r\ncome along as well as her venerable limbs’ll carry her.”\r\n\r\n“But how did you know so well that we had drifted to Anticosti?”\r\n\r\n“Well, for various reasons. Partly because I found out from Mrs. Corbet\r\nall about her crazy experiment at anchoring the ship; partly because I\r\nunderstood the general set of the tide; partly because I knew how the\r\nwind had been; but chiefly, I may say, because I had a presentiment all\r\nalong that you were bound to get ashore on the worst place in all the\r\ngulf; which was Anticosti, and no other place. I knowed it. I was sure\r\nof it.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Fawn was careering through the waters. The boys had no\r\nregret at leaving Bailey’s den, even though a number of cans of meat had\r\nbeen left behind. Bailey was on the broad grin, and felt no homesickness\r\nwhatever. Arthur and Tom could not help contrasting the Fawn with the\r\nAntelope, greatly to the disadvantage of the latter, and began to\r\nthink that in choosing Captain Corbet for their guide, they had made\r\na mistake. But all these thoughts were swallowed up in the one great\r\nthought of the deliverance which they were bringing to their friends\r\nin the cove--a deliverance so much better than anything which they had\r\nhoped for, since it was in the form of old familiar friends, and\r\nnot through the medium of strangers. Even the Antelope, and the\r\nmuch-maligned Corbet, as they followed far behind, seemed like\r\nadditional elements in their joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\n_Out on the Headland.--The doomed Ship.--The Struggle with the\r\nWaters.--The ravening Waves.--All over.--The last of the Petrel.--An\r\nInterruption at Dinner.--Startling Sight.--The strange, yet\r\nfamiliar Sail.--A grand and joyous Reunion.--Away from the Isle\r\nof Desolation.--The Antelope once more.--Over the Sea to\r\nMiramichi.--Farewell.--Captain Corbet moralizes, and Sermonizes._\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT on the headland the boys stood watching. Bruce was sad and\r\npreoccupied. The others gazed uneasily upon the rough water. Could\r\nArthur and Tom ever sail the boat through such a sea? That was the\r\nquestion which occurred to every one, and every one felt in his own\r\nheart that it was impossible. The prospect was not pleasant. They could\r\nonly hope that the boys had gained the shore, and were waiting there\r\ntill the wind might blow over. With this hope they tried to encourage\r\nBruce, who showed more depression than the rest, and blamed himself\r\nseveral times for not insisting on going in Arthur’s place.\r\n\r\nAt length they went back to the place where the Petrel lay. On reaching\r\nit they found that a marked change had taken place. Thus far, though low\r\nin the water, she had always preserved a certain symmetry of outline;\r\nand to those who might stand on her deck in fine weather and smooth\r\nwater she seemed quite uninjured. But now her decks appeared to be burst\r\nopen; she seemed broken in two. Bow and stern were low under water,\r\nwhile amidships she was above it. The mainmast inclined forward, and\r\nthe foremast sloped back so far that they almost touched. Where she\r\nhad parted asunder the planks of the decks had also started, and as the\r\nwaves rolled over her, every new assault increased the ruin.\r\n\r\n“She’s hogged,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“She’s worse than hogged,” said Bruce; “she’s completely broken in two.”\r\n\r\n“She’s fallen upon some ridge of rock,” said Phil, “and the weight of\r\nher cargo has done it.”\r\n\r\n“Deed thin, an the waves have had somethin to do with that same,” said\r\nPat; “and glad am I that we’re all out of her, so I am; and lucky it\r\nwas for us that she didn’t go ashore on that same reef, the night of the\r\nstarrum.”\r\n\r\nThe boys looked on in silence. The work of destruction went on slowly,\r\nbut surely, before their very eyes. Each wave did something towards\r\nhastening the catastrophe. That the Petrel was doomed was now beyond the\r\npossibility of doubt.\r\n\r\nRocks were beneath her, and never-ending billows rolled over her, making\r\nher their prey.\r\n\r\nAt length the fore part of the ship rolled over, with the deck towards\r\nthem, severing itself completely from the other half. The decks gaped\r\nwide, and opened; the sides started: the foremast came down with a\r\ncrash, and the pitiless waves, rolling on incessantly, flung themselves\r\none after the other upon the wreck. The two parts were soon completely\r\nsevered, the fore part breaking up first, the other half resisting more\r\nobstinately; while the sea was covered with sticks of timber that were\r\ntorn out from her and flung away upon the face of the waters.\r\n\r\nAt length the ruin of the fore part was completed, and that part of the\r\nship, all torn asunder, with all that part of the cargo, was dissipated\r\nand scattered over the water and along the beach. The other half still\r\nclung together, and though sorely bruised and shaken, seemed to put\r\nforth an obstinate resistance. At every touch of the waves it rolled\r\nover only to struggle back; it rose up, but was flung down again upon\r\nthe rocks; it seemed to be writhing in agony. At length the mainmast\r\nwent down with a crash, followed not long after by the mizzenmast. Then\r\nthe fragment of the ship suddenly split, and the entire quarterdeck was\r\nraised up. Here the waves flung themselves, tearing it away from the\r\nhull. But before the quarter-deck was altogether severed, the rest of\r\nthe ship gave way, and parted in all directions. One by one the huge\r\ntimber logs were detached from her cargo; the separation of the parts\r\nof the ship, and the dissolution of her compact cargo, gave a greater\r\nsurface to the action of the waves, which now roared, and foamed, and\r\nboiled, and seethed, and flung themselves in fury over every portion\r\nof the disordered, swaying, yielding mass. Fragment after fragment was\r\nwrenched away; bit by bit the strong hull crumbled at the stroke of the\r\nmighty billows. The fragments were strewn afar over the sea, and along\r\nthe beach; and the boys saw the mizzen-top, where they had found refuge\r\non that eventful night, drifting away towards the headland. At length\r\nall was over; and in place of the Petrel there remained nothing but a\r\nvast mass of fragments, strewing the rocky shore, and floating over the\r\nsea for many a mile.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, was the work of hours. The boys watched it all as\r\nthough they were held to the spot by a species of fascination. There\r\nseemed to be a spell upon them. They could not tear themselves away.\r\nBut at last there was nothing left; nothing but floating fragments; or\r\ntimbers flung by the waves on the shore, with which the waves seemed\r\nto play, as they hurled them forward and drew them back; while of the\r\nPetrel herself there was no sign--no coherent mass, however battered and\r\nbeaten, which might serve to be pointed out as the representative of the\r\nship that once bore them all. Of that ship there was nothing left; she\r\nwas dissolved; she was scattered afar; she was no more. Such was the end\r\nof the Petrel.\r\n\r\nHours had passed while the boys were watching there. At length they\r\nstarted back to their camp. They walked on in silence. There was a\r\ncertain sadness over all. This sadness arose in part from the scene\r\nwhich they had just witnessed, and in part out of their anxiety about\r\nArthur and Tom, which now had grown to be serious, since they had seen\r\nwith their own eyes the power of the waves. When the strong ship had\r\nyielded, what chance had that frail boat? And Arthur and Tom knew very\r\nlittle about navigation. Where were they now?\r\n\r\nWith these sad and anxious thoughts, they made their way back, and found\r\nSolomon in a state of great excitement because they had kept dinner\r\nwaiting. They found that it was past three o’clock, and were amazed that\r\nit was so late.\r\n\r\nDinner was now served, accompanied by lamentations long and loud from\r\nSolomon, who protested against such neglect and indifference as they had\r\nshown, whereby everything had become spoiled from waiting.\r\n\r\n“Now dis yer dinna, chilen, am no common dinna,” said he. “I ben makin\r\nrangements to hab a rail fust-chop, stylish dinna, and hab cocted a new\r\ndish ob succotash. I took some potted corn an biled it wid the beans, an\r\nif dat don’t make succotash, I don’ know what do--dat’s all; an dat\r\nar succotash, wid de ham, and oysta chowda, an coffee, an game pie, an\r\ntomato, had ought to make a men-jous good dinna; ought so.”\r\n\r\nThe boys said nothing. They were hungry, and they were also sad. For\r\nboth reasons they felt disinclined to speak. They were anxious about\r\nArthur and Tom; they also felt mournful about the sad fate of the\r\nPetrel; they also had dismal forebodings about their own future; but at\r\nthe same time they were most undeniably hungry, ravenously hungry, in\r\nfact; and Bruce, who was most sad and most anxious, was the hungriest of\r\nthe crowd.\r\n\r\nSo they all sat down to dinner, and, first of all, they devoted\r\nthemselves to Solomon’s succotash. This was a compound of potted corn\r\nand dried beans; and though the real original succotash is a dish\r\ncompounded from green corn and green beans, yet this was no bad\r\nsubstitute; and they all felt, in spite of their sadness, that it was\r\nan idea whose originality did infinite credit to the culinary genius of\r\nSolomon.\r\n\r\nNow they had about come to the end of the succotash, and were looking\r\nabout, like Alexander, for more worlds to conquer, or, in other words,\r\nfor more dishes to devour, and were languidly awaiting the next course\r\nwhich Solomon might bring, when suddenly a wild cry from Pat roused them\r\nall from languor to the greatest excitement.\r\n\r\n“Whoroo! Thunder and turf!” cried Pat; and he sprang to his feet as he\r\nspoke. “Be the powers! but it’s fairly dead I am with joy this day. O,\r\nlook! O, look! look, boys! jools! see’ out there! They’re a comin for\r\nus’ so they are! We’re saved! We’re saved! Hooray! Hooray! O, look! It’s\r\na schooner; she’s comin for us; she’s goin to take us out o’ this; and\r\nO! but it’s the bright clever boys that Arthur and Tom are to come back\r\nso soon, and with a schooner like that same.”\r\n\r\nLong before Pat had finished his Irish howl, and while he was yet\r\nhowling, the others had sprung to their feet, and were looking out to\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nAnd there, rounding the headland, and bearing down towards them, they\r\nsaw a beautiful schooner, graceful as a pleasure yacht, with all her\r\nsnow-white sails spread wide in spite of the fresh breeze that was\r\nblowing, as though hurrying towards them to seek and to save. Never\r\nhad they seen a more beautiful craft; but its own proper beauty was now\r\nincreased a hundred fold by the thought that their safety, their rescue,\r\ntheir deliverance, was the purpose that guided her here, and that she\r\nwas coming to restore them to home, to friends, and to all the joys of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThree cheers!\r\n\r\nYes, and three more!\r\n\r\nYes, and three times three, and nine times nine, and cheers without end!\r\nThey cheered. They shouted. They danced. They hugged one another for\r\nvery joy.\r\n\r\nSolomon joined in the general jubilation. He did this by standing apart\r\nand bursting into tears.\r\n\r\n“Don’t mind me,” he muttered. “’Clar, I can’t help it, nohow. De tears\r\nwill come, but dey’s all tears ob j’y. It’s ben a drefful tryin time\r\nto me all along, chilen, dis yer time, for I allus ben a feelin an\r\na thinkin as how dat I had some han in a bringin ob you to dese yer\r\nstremities; but I held out, I bore up, all for your sakes; but now all\r\nam ober; an O, de precious sakes! dar’s a ole man hereabouts, chil’en,\r\ndat’s like to bust wid j’y! Don’t mind me. All right! Hooray! All safe\r\nat last!--an de chilen snatched from the jaws ob roonatium! O, do go way\r\nnow, or else dis yer nigga’ll bust!”\r\n\r\nAnd at this Solomon really did burst--into tears.\r\n\r\nThe glorious schooner! the beautiful schooner! the schooner with the\r\nswan-like form and the snow-white sails! She plunged through the waters,\r\nthe waves foamed about her bows, as she hurried on towards them. Arthur\r\nand Tom were there; they knew it, or else how should that schooner come\r\nso straight towards them? No more fears now, no more anxieties. Arthur\r\nand Tom were both safe, and the deep joy of that little company arose\r\nmore from the assurance of this than even from the prospect of their own\r\nrescue.\r\n\r\nThe schooner came near. She rounded to; she dropped her anchor. A\r\nboat was lowered. Three figures appeared in the boat--one rowing with\r\nvigorous strokes, two smaller ones in the stern. The boat came nearer.\r\nIn the stern they saw the two, and recognized them as they came nearer.\r\nThey had felt sure at the first, but now they saw with their own eyes\r\nArthur and Tom; and O, with what joy, with what jubilation, with what\r\nshouts, what cries, what leaps of joy! Arthur and Tom waved their hands,\r\nthey stretched out their arms, they called out incoherent words, and it\r\nwas with incoherent words that those on the shore responded.\r\n\r\nThe boat grounded. The boys ashore rushed into the water to seize Arthur\r\nand Tom in their arms. Then the man who had rowed the boat stood up and\r\nlooked at them. They saw him. They knew him. Captain Ferguson! Tears\r\nwere in his eyes, and he tried to hide them, but couldn’t. Captain\r\nTobias Ferguson, bold sailor, strong, brave man, broke down on this\r\noccasion, and cried like a child.\r\n\r\nThen he went about shaking hands and talking wildly. He grabbed old\r\nSolomon’s hand, and shook it most warmly. He asked anxiously about his\r\nhealth. Solomon was still sobbing and crying with utter joy. Neither\r\nof them knew what he was doing. Both felt the same emotions, yet the\r\nemotions of each arose from the same cause, and that was, anxiety about\r\nthese boys, whom they loved, for whom they had feared so much, and\r\nsuffered so much, and over whose safety they now rejoiced with such deep\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ferguson did not say much, but made them all get into the boat\r\nand go aboard the Fawn. He did not look at their camp, nor did they\r\nfeel any regret at leaving the work which had caused them so much toil.\r\nSolomon only stipulated that he should take away the provisions--the\r\nbarrels of biscuit, the potted meats, the hams, and whatever else had\r\nbeen accumulated there on that desolate shore. Nor was there any reason\r\nfor longer delay, for the associations of the place were by no means of\r\na kind which they chose to dwell upon; so the Fawn turned her back upon\r\nAnticosti, and stood out to sea.\r\n\r\nAs they passed the headland Bruce pointed out to Arthur and Tom the\r\nbroken fragments of the Petrel, which still lined the rocky shore. But\r\nthe eye of Captain Ferguson was turned elsewhere. He was on the lookout\r\nfor the Antelope.\r\n\r\n“We’ve got to go back after her,” said he. “If we wait for her, she\r\nwon’t be here till to-morrow morning, and we can run down to where she\r\nis in less than an hour.”\r\n\r\nAs he said these words the Fawn passed outside the headland, and there,\r\nfar away to the east, heading out to sea in one of her tacks, was the\r\nAntelope. There she was, her very venerable self at last, the schooner\r\nfor which they had so often searched the water, for whose appearance\r\nthey had so longed and hoped, and which never came through all those\r\nweary and despairing days. Now, when she was not needed, and, in fact,\r\nwas not particularly wanted, she made herself visible.\r\n\r\nThe wind, which was against the Antelope, was fair for the Fawn, and\r\nin a short time the two schooners were within hail. Captain Corbet then\r\nmade the best of his way on board the Fawn.\r\n\r\nHe had already seen the boys, and guessed all. When he stood before them\r\nthe boys were all shocked at his appearance. Venerable he had always\r\nbeen, but now he looked ten years older than when they last had seen\r\nhim. He was also very much agitated, trembled violently, and, going\r\naround, he shook hands with every one in silence. Then he turned away\r\nhis head and wept. The boys all felt deeply touched at seeing this\r\nexhibition of feeling on his part, and even Captain Ferguson looked at\r\nhim with less severity.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, “I do believe he’s shed a good many tears about you,\r\nand if he did bring you into a scrape, he’s suffered enough for it, I\r\nsay.”\r\n\r\nAfter this his treatment of the venerable navigator was far more\r\ngenerous than it had hitherto been.\r\n\r\n“I ain’t got much time to spare,” said he, “captain, but I’m bound to\r\nsee these boys in a place of safety. So I propose to sail to Miramichi,\r\nand you hurry along as fast as your old tub can get through the water.\r\nI understand you’re all going straight back to the Bay of Fundy, and I\r\ndon’t see why you shouldn’t be able to do that much safe enough; so I’ll\r\ndeliver up the boys to your care in Mirami-chi. I think I can make them\r\ncomfortable enough till then aboard the Fawn.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet had nothing to say against this decision, but meekly\r\nreturned to the Antelope, and prepared to follow the Fawn to the\r\ndestination mentioned. As for the boys, they were delighted, and felt\r\nonly too glad at being able to have a short cruise on board such a\r\nvessel as the Fawn.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the Fawn reached her destination, but the Antelope\r\ndid not turn up until a day later. The boys now went back to their old\r\nquarters, and Captain Ferguson bade them all good by. Bailey accompanied\r\nhim, having been engaged by him as one of his crew.\r\n\r\n“Wal, boys,” said Captain Corbet, after Ferguson had taken his\r\ndeparture, “we’ve lived, an we hev suffered, an hev mootooly ben called\r\non to undergo triboolations that ain’t often met with in this mortual\r\nspere. This uthly life is one of strange vycissitoods, an the seafarin\r\nlife has fre-kent ups an downs. I don’t think I ever, in all my born\r\ndays, was called upon to endoor more pewer mentual tortoor than in this\r\nweek that’s past an gone. The wust of it all was the thought that it was\r\nmy fault, and mine only. So now, boys, look at me, and take a warnin.\r\nBewar, above all, of avarice. Think of me, with my plans for sudden\r\nwealth. Terrew, I might say that it was keer for the babby that animated\r\nthis excited boosom; I might plead the affection of a absint feyther a\r\nyearnin over his offsprin; but I forbar. I pint to my unworthy self, and\r\nsay, Bewar! Don’t ever allow yer young minds to grow delooded about the\r\nvain and glitterin toys of wealth and fortin! See what it’s cost us. We\r\nderreamed of a great ship, and cargo, and thousands upon thousands\r\nof pounds to divide among us; and what did we railly git? Salvage!\r\nfarewell, good by to you forever. Out of all our derreams we hev gained\r\nnothin but the Petrel’s boat, which ain’t so dreadful bad a boat nuther,\r\nbut contrariwise, and’ll be useful enough yet, maybe; an if we’d\r\nquietly taken that thar boat, and ben content, we’d a ben spard all\r\nthis trouble, which shows that a small possibility’s bet-ter’n a big\r\nimpossibility. Them’s my sentiments; and among the lessons which I hope\r\nto live to inculcate in the mind of my babby, the most important shall\r\nbe the story of the ship that we PICKED UP ADRIFT.”",
