Piles of lifeless sand? A\r\ngiant sandbox? Each of us sees the dunes differently. We would like to\r\nshare the story of the Death Valley Sand Dunes with you. This booklet\r\nprovides answers to some of your questions about the origin, composition\r\nand formation of the dunes. We will also look at the plants, and for\r\nevidence of animals that make their home here.\r\n\r\nThe features discussed are near the edge of the dunes and all you need\r\nis your curiosity to explore this fascinating place. A magnifying glass\r\nor magnet may add to your enjoyment. Remember—the dunes can be hot in\r\nspring and fall as well as in summer months. Be sure to carry water,\r\ndistance is deceiving, and a short stroll may become an extended walk.\r\nDo you want to walk barefoot? Be careful around the bushes; thorns and\r\nplant debris are hidden in the sand. Carry your shoes, your feet may get\r\ntired, or the sand may become too hot. When you are in the shade, look\r\naround to see if other creatures are sharing the same cool place. This\r\nis home for such desert dwellers as lizards, kangaroo rats and\r\nsidewinders.\r\n\r\nThere is no guided trail since wind can soon cover a trail with sand.\r\nIt’s easy to find your way around and can be fun to choose your own\r\nroute. Look behind you to get firmly in your mind which mountain feature\r\nwill be your landmark to guide you back to your vehicle.\r\n\r\nTo make the best use of this booklet, flip through it to locate topics\r\nof interest. Read in sequence, or follow the order of your discoveries.\r\nUse your senses to appreciate and explore the sand dunes more fully.\r\nPick up some sand occasionally and compare the texture, temperature and\r\nother qualities to that found in other locations. Be alert for little\r\nthings—notice plants, sand ripples, animal burrows and tracks.\r\n\r\nLet’s walk into the dunes a short distance and learn their secrets. To\r\nform sand dunes, three things are needed: wind, sand, and a place for\r\nthe sand to collect. The story of the dunes involves interaction among\r\nthese factors and the plants and animals that make their homes in this\r\nsea of sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY ARE THE DUNES HERE?\r\n\r\nAre they limited to this section of the valley? Do they migrate? Answers\r\nto these questions are in the winds.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Significant seasonal variations in wind patterns\r\n    affect the dunes._]\r\n\r\nWinter and summer bring winds from different directions; northerly in\r\nwinter and southerly in summer. Landforms influence crosswinds and\r\nswirling wind currents (eddies). These crosswind and eddy patterns\r\nresult in decreased wind speed and cause the sand to drop out in the\r\nsame general area time after time. Seasonal variations in wind direction\r\nhelp keep the sand in one area.\r\n\r\nBetween individual dunes, white salt deposits are often seen on the\r\nsurface of an old clay lakebed (playa). Here too, we see how tall the\r\ndunes are because the sand is piled entirely on top of this playa.\r\nInfrequent rains produce changes in the playa surface, and occasionally\r\ngravel is washed into the area from nearby mountains. Because of the\r\nclay content of the soil, rain water does not soak in quickly, but lies\r\nin pools. As the pools evaporate, fresh deposits of salts and minerals\r\nremain on the surface. Similar salt deposits throughout the valley to\r\nthe south minimize the amount of available blowing sand by cementing it\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nDunes in Death Valley consist of sand from local materials found in\r\nnearby mountains. The primary source of this sand is believed to be the\r\nCottonwood Mountains to the west and northwest. Although the shapes and\r\npatterns of individual dunes may vary daily or seasonally, the dune\r\nfield itself is relatively stable.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {Dunes}]\r\n\r\nPick up some sand! Is it fine or coarse? Wet or dry? Warm or cold?\r\nNotice the different colors. A magnet may help you separate particles,\r\nand a magnifying glass will allow you to examine them more closely. Most\r\nblack particles are magnetite—most white ones are quartz. Other minerals\r\nprovide still different colors. The sand here is a product of weathering\r\nby wind, rain and chemical changes—breaking blocks of rock (primarily\r\ngranite) from nearby mountains into particles small and light enough to\r\nbe carried by run-off and tossed around in the frequent desert winds.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Take a close look at sand grains._]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ARE DUNES AND RIPPLES FORMED?\r\n\r\nEach wind produces changes to the surface of the sand. It takes a 10 mph\r\n(16 kph) wind to move fine, dry sand. During a sandstorm, it may seem as\r\nif the sand is blowing thousands of feet into the air. Your view of the\r\ndistant mountains may be obscured. Don’t be fooled! The dunes are not\r\nentirely airborne! What you see are dust particles being carried aloft\r\nbecause they are smaller and lighter than sand grains. Seldom does\r\ndune-sized sand itself rise more than 6 ft. (2 m) above the ground, it\r\nis too heavy.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {Ripples}]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {Movement of sand grains}]\r\n\r\nActually, most sand travels within about 18 in. (46 cm) of the ground in\r\na jumping movement called saltation. A windborne grain bounces a short\r\ndistance before crashing into the sandy surface sending other grains\r\ninto flight. The process continues as the wind carries the new grains a\r\nlittle farther, crashing them, in turn, into the surface and other\r\ngrains along the way. Sand grains too heavy to blow in the wind creep\r\nalong the surface of the sand, while smaller ones are truly airborne\r\nabove the dunes. As a consequence, the entire sand surface flows or\r\ncreeps along.\r\n\r\nHave you been comparing the texture, size and color of sand in various\r\nsections of the dunes? Some differences will be more obvious if you have\r\nthe chance to visit both the tall dunes by Highway 190 and the low ones\r\nby the picnic area. The soft, fine sand by the picnic area is carried\r\nfarther by the wind than the coarser material found in the taller dunes.\r\n\r\nSmaller grains move farther than large ones. As a result of this sorting\r\nof sand grains by variable winds, the larger grains accumulate in small\r\nridges forming ripples. Size and shape of these formations are related\r\nto specific interactions between sand and wind. The windward side of a\r\ndune generally has more dramatic sculpturing. Examine an area with\r\ninteresting ripples. Wind speed, direction, duration, and the amount of\r\nsand are important factors that have been measured and used to determine\r\nthe size and spacing of dune ripples. Just as these ripples form, the\r\ndunes themselves respond to changes in each of these factors.\r\n\r\n        { Speed               { Size\r\n  WIND  { Duration    + SAND  { Uniformity = RIPPLE FORMATION\r\n        { Direction           { Amount\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {Cross-section of dune}]\r\n\r\n  SUMMIT\r\n  ANGLE OF REPOSE\r\n  SLIPFACE\r\n  WINDWARD\r\n  ANGLE OF REPOSE\r\n  FOC\r\n  34°\r\n\r\nAll dunes may be described by the above traits. Variations in shape and\r\nsize of individual dunes are determined by the mathematical values\r\napplied to each of the traits mentioned in the discussion of ripple\r\nformation. Another feature of interest is the dune shape. Among these\r\ndunes you may find examples of this classic textbook model and its\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Plants on the playa in between the dunes_]\r\n\r\nNote that the downwind side of the dune, the slipface, is the steeper\r\none. Fine dry sand can only pile up so high before it breaks away and\r\nslides down the slipface as an avalanche to rest at the more stable\r\nangle of repose, about 34 degrees. We create miniature avalanches as we\r\nwalk along the crest of a steep dune.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT PLANTS LIVE HERE?\r\n\r\nEach area within the dunes has something different to offer. Low dunes\r\nnear the picnic area have more vegetation than the tall dunes near\r\nHighway 190.\r\n\r\nPlants, visible from the top of many dunes, help the dunes remain here\r\nby stabilizing the sand with their branches and roots. You will see\r\ndifferent plants, depending on whether you are in the tall or low dunes.\r\nYou may find them in a different sequence from that used in this\r\nbooklet. By looking for different shades of green, you should find each\r\nof the major shrubs and trees that live in the dunes. Use the diagrams\r\nand photos to help identify those you see. Let’s take a closer look to\r\nlearn how they survive and how they relate to the story of the dunes.\r\n\r\nCan you find a low bush which appears to have no leaves? The stems are\r\njointed and succulent (juicy) and vary in color from yellowish to bright\r\ngreen, depending on the season. Pickleweed (_Allenrolfea occidentalis_),\r\nis often found on top of low mounds of sand. Do the stems look like tiny\r\npickles joined end-to-end? During summer months, tiny, inconspicuous,\r\nyellow flowers may be seen at the joints. With a magnifying glass, you\r\nmay see the miniature leaves.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PICKLEWEED\r\n    (_Allenrolfea occidentalis_)]\r\n\r\nBy reducing leaf size, the plant minimizes surface through which water\r\ncan be lost. Green stems assume the task of photosynthesis, normally\r\ndone by leaves, providing food for the plant of this arid environment.\r\n\r\nAlthough the sand does not often appear wet, pickleweed suggests water\r\nis not far below the surface. It requires a wet soil and can grow in\r\nvery salty areas. Watch for pickleweed near Badwater also.\r\n\r\nFind a different shrub, gently rub a leaf and smell it. Does it smell\r\nfaintly like fish? Look at the leaf you have just rubbed. Did the\r\nsurface dust rub off to reveal a deeper shade of green? Does it have\r\nfleshy leaves? If so, you have found the inkweed (_Suaeda torryana_). If\r\nyour shrub has a less noticeable smell, and perhaps rubber-like texture,\r\nand if you did not easily remove the white chalky coating from the light\r\ngray green leaves, it is saltbush. If your shrub has numerous tiny\r\nspines, be careful, you may have found a Russian thistle (_Salsola\r\nkali_) or tumbleweed, as it is also called. They are not native to Death\r\nValley, but have become established in certain areas.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: INKWEED\r\n    (_Suaeda torryana_)]\r\n\r\nInkweed’s young succulent leaves and seeds were used for food by local\r\nShoshoni Indians. Stems and leaves were processed to make a black dye.\r\nYou may notice tiny balls of seeds at the very ends of some branches.\r\nThe green flowers are very inconspicuous.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FOUR-WING SALTBUSH\r\n    (_Atriplex canescens_)]\r\n\r\nSaltbush is light green and its dry, flat leaves are covered with salt.\r\nRoots remove salts from the soil and water, then the salt is deposited\r\non the outer surface of the leaves. Consequently, the whitened leaf\r\nsurfaces reflect sunlight, thereby reducing temperature and water loss.\r\nThere are male and female saltbushes. You may want to search for seeds\r\nor flowers. Seeds on female bushes have four tiny wings which give it\r\nthe name—four-wing saltbush (_Atriplex canescens_). Seeds were used as\r\nfood by Shoshoni Indians.\r\n\r\nOn your way into the dunes did you notice any other plants? If not,\r\nwatch for them as you return to your vehicle. Remember, the kinds of\r\nplants vary depending on your location in the dunes. The clumps of grass\r\nnear the picnic tables are alkali sacaton (_Sporobolis airoides_).\r\nApproaching the tall dunes you may have seen large plants with small,\r\nshiny, smooth, dark green leaves—the creosote bush (_Larrea\r\ntridentata_). It has small yellow flowers, usually observed in\r\nspringtime. Later, small, fuzzy, white balls containing seeds grow on\r\nits branches. The larger green or brown, walnut shaped growths on the\r\nbranches are galls formed in response to an insect invader (midge). If\r\nyou missed creosote bushes in the dunes, watch for them along the\r\nroadsides—they are common.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CREOSOTE BUSH\r\n    (_Larrea tridentata_)]\r\n\r\nAlthough the sand dunes seem dry, there is an underground reservoir\r\nproviding moisture and nutrients for vegetation. The crusty mud playa\r\nacts as a cap and reduces evaporation of the underground water supply.\r\nNearby, at Salt Creek, the same water flows on the surface as a stream\r\nduring the winter and spring.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MESQUITE\r\n    (_Prosopis glandulosa_)]\r\n\r\nMost plants grow in the hollows between the dunes where they receive\r\nsome protection from the wind and can reach water more easily. Yet, the\r\nmesquite tree (_Prosopis glandulosa_), probably the largest plant in\r\nsight, is often on top of the dunes. By slowing the wind with its\r\nbranches, the mesquite causes sand to pile up in mounds beneath it.\r\nSometimes sand completely covers a part of the tree causing branches to\r\ndie. The sand then blows away, exposing those dead branches. Look for an\r\nexample which illustrates this sand movement. Mesquite trees have\r\nthorns, so be careful. The mesquite tree loses its small, delicate\r\nleaves during winter. Its deep root system, growing 50-60 ft. (16-20 m)\r\ninto the ground to reach fresh water, helps the tree survive. Some\r\nplants, such as saltbush, pickleweed, and mesquite seem incompatible\r\nbecause of different mineral and water requirements. However, these\r\nplants are able to live near each other because their roots are drawing\r\nmoisture and nutrients from different levels of the soil. For example,\r\nin a rain forest, where the roots have ample water, most plant growth is\r\nabove ground where competition is for sunlight. Whereas in a desert,\r\nwhere sunlight is abundant, competition for water is more critical. The\r\nroot system of desert plants are highly developed, and each plant will\r\nfind the optimum level in the soil suitable for its growth.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Mesquite tree: sand collector, food and shelter for\r\n    animals and Shoshoni._]\r\n\r\nBe careful not to trample the roots as you explore the mound of sand\r\nnear the mesquite tree—you may collapse a burrow—remember, you and the\r\nanimals may be sharing the same shade.\r\n\r\nMesquite trees are also special in that they produce an edible and\r\nnutritious fruit. In late spring, tiny, yellow flower spikes hang from\r\nthe branches. These develop into yellow bean pods by late summer. Many\r\ndifferent animals use the beans for food. Mesquite beans were also a\r\nmajor food source for the Shoshoni.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT DID THE SHOSHONI DO HERE?\r\n\r\nShoshoni Indians have lived in Death Valley for many years—migrating to\r\nthe mountains for the hot summer months and returning to the valley for\r\nthe winter. Their movements were related to supplies of food and water\r\nand influence of temperature. It is more likely that areas such as these\r\nsand dunes were visited for food gathering rather than as a place of\r\nresidence. To survive in the desert, the Shoshoni had to learn which\r\nplants to eat, where they grew and when to harvest them. They also\r\nlearned which animals were reliable food sources—where they could be\r\nfound in abundance and when they were active.\r\n\r\nUse your imagination—how well could you survive in this wild area? Where\r\nand how would you find water? Which plants and animals would you eat?\r\n\r\n\r\nWHICH ANIMALS LIVE HERE?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: KANGAROO RAT]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BURROW]\r\n\r\nGuess which animal lives in which hole! How large is the entrance? The\r\nsize of the entrance suggests the size of the animal. How many other\r\nopenings are nearby? Often escape exits save rodents from predators. Are\r\nthere recent tracks nearby to indicate it is an active burrow, or is it\r\ncovered with sand and debris blown in by the wind?\r\n\r\nInside these burrows the temperature and living conditions are not as\r\nextreme as those on the surface of the sand. Try digging a small hole in\r\nthe sand well away from bushes. How soon does the sand change as you\r\ndig? Is it warmer or cooler or wetter? Beneath the surface the moderate\r\ntemperatures and increased moisture provide an escape from the intense\r\nheat. Consequently, dune residents spend the day in their dens and are\r\nactive at night.\r\n\r\nKangaroo rats, for example, cannot tolerate heat and escape it by living\r\nunderground. Also they are active only at night. They are very efficient\r\nwater conservationists. Although water is essential to the kangaroo rat,\r\nthey rarely drink, but produce their own water from insects and dry\r\nseeds they eat. They have no sweat glands, and excrete highly\r\nconcentrated wastes to minimize water loss.\r\n\r\nThese rodents are not related to kangaroos at all! Their name refers to\r\ntheir hind legs which are highly developed for jumping.\r\n\r\nWatch for their tracks—when a kangaroo rat is moving slowly, it drags\r\nits tail which leaves a trail in the sand in conjunction with its foot\r\nprints. When the rat moves quickly, its tail doesn’t drag. From clues\r\nsuch as these we can determine whether the rat is running from a\r\npredator or just leisurely looking for food. The entrances to their\r\nburrows are about 4-5 in. (10-12 cm) in diameter and may be 3 ft. (1 m)\r\nor more deep. Smaller rodents, such as pocket mice, have similar habits\r\nbut live in smaller burrows.\r\n\r\nLizards are more active during daylight hours. Even though they tolerate\r\nhigher temperatures than rodents, they would perish if they were\r\nstranded in the open sun for an extended period of time. Notice how they\r\nrun from bush to bush, seeking the protective coolness as well as cover.\r\nLizards are cold-blooded animals, responding to temperatures around\r\nthem—cold, inactive—warm, active. In the winter months, there is very\r\nlittle lizard activity. However, summer days with ground temperatures\r\nreaching 200 degrees F. (92 degrees C.) or more are too hot for lizards,\r\nand they must seek shelter. They eat plant material, insects and smaller\r\nlizards, obtaining moisture from their food. They also conserve water by\r\nexcreting highly concentrated waste.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LIZARDS]\r\n\r\nPerhaps least observed, but most inquired about dunes dweller, is the\r\nsidewinder. Have you seen evidence of this rattlesnake today? It moves\r\nin a sidewise manner leaving a series of parallel, J-shaped tracks in\r\nthe sand.\r\n\r\nBy looping across the sand, the sidewinder reduces slippage over the\r\nloose material and decreases the amount of body surface in contact with\r\nthe hot sand. Sidewinders are primarily active at night, and escape the\r\nheat of the day under a bush or buried in the sand, exposing only the\r\nsmall horn-like structures on their heads. They eat kangaroo rats, mice\r\nand lizards.\r\n\r\nImagine the dunes as an ocean where all the sand is water and plants are\r\nislands scattered about. Each island offers shelter and a food supply\r\nfor the animals. Everytime an animal leaves the security of an island it\r\ntakes a risk. In daylight, people may play in the sand, but at night the\r\ndunes come alive with the real business of survival. Usually all we see\r\nof this activity the following morning is the evidence—tracks. Some\r\ntracks are easily identified—each tells a story. Use the diagrams to\r\ndetermine which animals most recently crossed the sea of sand around\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: KIT FOX]\r\n\r\nCoyotes come into the dunes for food. True opportunists, they eat\r\nwhatever is available—mice, kangaroo rats, rabbits, insects, mesquite\r\nbeans and many other things. Their tracks are difficult to distinguish\r\nfrom those left by domestic dogs. Smaller dog-like tracks are left by\r\nthe kit fox. These small foxes have large ears and well padded feet.\r\nThey too feed on small rodents. Coyotes and kit foxes receive moisture\r\nfrom their food and drink water at springs within their hunting range.\r\nThey avoid exposure to heat by being active at night and staying in dens\r\nor shaded areas during the heat of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 TRACKS\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COYOTE\r\n    2¼ in.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: KANGAROO RAT\r\n    ¼ in.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BEETLE\r\n    ¼ in.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: RAVEN\r\n    3½ in.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: KIT FOX\r\n    1¾ × 1⅞ in.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LIZARD\r\n    2 to 3 in.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SIDEWINDER\r\n    4 in.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JACKRABBIT]\r\n\r\nJackrabbits are not seen often in the dunes, although their tracks and\r\ndroppings are seen occasionally. They feed on plants, getting moisture\r\nfrom their food rather than from distant springs. Large ears radiate\r\nexcess body heat and help cool the animal as it rests in shaded areas\r\nduring the hot day.\r\n\r\nHave you seen any birds? Birds also leave tracks! The large bird tracks\r\nhere are generally left by ravens—big, black birds which eat almost\r\nanything. In the spring and fall, some migrating birds stop briefly.\r\nShrikes, sparrows, kingbirds and blackbirds are among the visitors and\r\nresidents of the dunes. Insects and vegetation provide food and shelter\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BEETLE]\r\n\r\nHave you seen any insects? Tracks resembling those of a tiny bulldozer\r\ntell us where beetles have traveled. Shiny black circus beetles or\r\nstinkbugs and gray snout beetles are often seen.\r\n\r\nSince most activity in the dunes takes place at night, very little of\r\nthis action is observed. However, in the morning we can stroll in the\r\nsand and unravel the secrets of the previous night. As you look at each\r\nset of tracks, imagine what the animal looks like as it moves. How big\r\nis it? How many feet does it have? Are the feet side by side as though\r\njumping like rodents or rabbits, or do they alternate as in the walking\r\nor running motion of lizards? How far apart are the prints? Does the\r\nanimal drag its tail? Now, where do the tracks go? Follow some animal\r\ntracks to see what interactions have taken place. The same animal may\r\nleave different tracks on different sand surfaces or under difference\r\ncircumstances. Notice your own tracks as you walk, run, jump or sit in\r\nloose or firm sand. Try it!\r\n\r\n_In many respects these dunes are like any Other deposits of windblown\r\nsand along the coast or in deserts. They reflect variations in the sand\r\nsupply and respond to particular wind patterns following the same basic,\r\nnatural principles. Several other National Parks and Monuments have sand\r\ndunes of various sizes and composition. Death Valley dunes are not the\r\nlargest in the United States by any means! Here the dunes reach a height\r\nof 80 ft. (24 m). They provide a visual change of pace with their soft\r\nlines and shadows in contrast to the sharp, rugged mountain peaks around\r\nthem._\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sand\r\n    soft\r\n      fine\r\n  Easy to sift and mold.\r\n  Once a solid block of rock now weathered very old.\r\n  Blown by winds into dunes and features.\r\n  Forming a hot dry home for desert creatures.\r\n  Patterns of shadow and shade by tree and sand dune made.\r\n  Walk\r\n    touch\r\n      explore\r\n  Enjoy the dunes and come back once more.\r\n                                                      Donna Paul Bessken\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {Dunes}]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hope you have enjoyed this walking tour.
