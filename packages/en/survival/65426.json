E. Lamar\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mineral resources of Illinois include many rocks and minerals of\r\nvaried character and uses. From them are made an array of everyday\r\nproducts whose sources may not even be recognized by the consumer. The\r\nuser of a glass bottle, for instance, rarely knows that it may have been\r\nmade from Illinois silica sand, nor is the driver of an automobile\r\ngenerally aware that the Illinois concrete highway on which he is\r\ndriving probably was constructed from a mixture of cement, sand and\r\ngravel, or crushed stone that may have come from Illinois pits or\r\nquarries.\r\n\r\nThe significance of these rocks and minerals to the economy of Illinois\r\nis great, although often unappreciated. Of the more than 600 million\r\ndollar value of all Illinois mineral production in 1963, almost 200\r\nmillion was from industrial minerals. The diversity and widespread\r\ndistribution of these mineral resources lend variety and balance to the\r\nmineral industry of the state, and their production, processing, and\r\nutilization afford direct and indirect employment to many people.\r\n\r\nThe term industrial minerals is used as a convenient group term for\r\nnonmetallic minerals that are not fuels. In Illinois they include\r\nlimestone, dolomite, clay, shale, silica sand and other sands,\r\nfluorspar, tripoli (amorphous silica), ganister, novaculite, sandstone,\r\nfeldspar-bearing sands, barite, gypsum, anhydrite, brines, greensand,\r\noil shale, marl, peat, humus, and tufa. The metallic minerals of\r\nIllinois are galena (lead ore), sphalerite (zinc ore), pyrite, and\r\nmarcasite.\r\n\r\nThis booklet briefly and nontechnically discusses the foregoing\r\nmaterials and some of the work the Illinois State Geological Survey does\r\nin gathering information about their occurrence, and character and in\r\ndeveloping new uses.\r\n\r\nThe assistance of many Survey staff members and of many people in the\r\nIllinois mineral industry in the preparation of this booklet is\r\nacknowledged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LIMESTONE\r\n\r\n\r\nLimestone is a most versatile rock. Without it there would be no\r\nportland cement for making concrete roads and buildings, no lime for\r\nplastering and chemical use, no agricultural limestone for farms, and no\r\ncrushed limestone for driveways. A wide variety of industries, from\r\nsteel making to glass manufacturing, use limestone in one way or\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe early settlers of Illinois recognized the value of limestone and\r\nquarried stone blocks and slabs for making foundations, chimneys, and\r\neven houses. For mortar they used a mixture of sand and lime to hold the\r\nblocks together. The lime was made by heating limestone red hot in\r\nsimple furnaces or kilns, the ruins of a few of which may still be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Kinds of Limestone\r\n\r\nIllinois has two principal varieties of limestone, referred to\r\ntechnically as limestone and dolomite. “Limestone” may be used as a\r\ngeneral name for both varieties.\r\n\r\nLimestone consists principally of crystalline particles of the mineral\r\ncalcite (fig. 1). This mineral is glassy in appearance and is composed\r\nof calcium, carbon, and oxygen combined to form calcium carbonate—CaCO₃.\r\nDolomite is largely made of crystalline particles of the mineral\r\ndolomite, which also has a glassy appearance and consists of calcium,\r\nmagnesium, carbon, and oxygen—CaMg(CO₃)₂. The crystalline particles of\r\nlimestone and dolomite vary in size. Some are coarse enough to be seen\r\neasily, others are so small that they can be distinguished only with a\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Formation of Limestone and Dolomite\r\n\r\nAlmost all Illinois limestones were formed in seas that covered Illinois\r\nmillions of years ago. The many different limestone formations in\r\nIllinois suggest that oceans covered all or part of the area several\r\ntimes. Numerous kinds of shell fish, corals, and other marine animals\r\nlived in these oceans and had shells and other hard parts made of\r\ncalcium carbonate. Through countless generations, these animal remains\r\naccumulated on the ocean floor and gradually were compacted and cemented\r\ninto limestone (fig. 2).\r\n\r\nOther Illinois limestones, however, were formed by the hardening of muds\r\ncomposed mainly of calcium carbonate that accumulated on the floors of\r\nthe ancient seas. Still other limestones were formed of a combination of\r\nanimal remains and lime mud.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 1—Calcite crystals. Limestone is made up\r\n    mainly of calcite crystals, but they are less perfectly formed and\r\n    are crowded together.]\r\n\r\nThe coral reefs of the South Pacific Ocean have their counterparts in\r\nIllinois. The ancient Illinois oceans contained extensive reefs that\r\nwere built up just as the modern reefs have been. In northern Illinois,\r\naround Chicago for instance, a number of the ancient reefs are now the\r\nsite of stone quarries. In southwestern Illinois such reefs are a source\r\nof petroleum.\r\n\r\nThe dolomites of Illinois probably were originally limestones, but,\r\neither while the limestones were still beneath the sea or after the sea\r\nhad withdrawn, magnesium was exchanged for some of the calcium in the\r\nlimestones. If the exchange took place under the sea, the sea water was\r\nthe source of the magnesium. If it happened when the limestones were a\r\npart of the land, the magnesium was brought in by water circulating\r\nthrough the rock. Many of the marine animal fossils became difficult to\r\nrecognize after the change, and the texture and general appearance of\r\nthe rock also were altered. Some of it became noticeably porous.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 2—Limestone containing fossils. An Archimedes\r\n    screw appears at lower left, lace-like bryozoa in the center, and\r\n    fluted brachiopod shells at top and center.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Uses of Limestone and Dolomite\r\n\r\nSome of the major uses for Illinois limestone and dolomite are mentioned\r\nbelow. Not every limestone or dolomite can be used for all purposes\r\nbecause for each use the stone must fulfill special requirements of a\r\nchemical or physical nature. For example, it must have high purity for\r\nlime, resistance to wear and weather for roads and buildings, and a\r\npleasing appearance for decorative stone and marble.\r\n\r\n_Lime._—When limestone or dolomite is heated to a high temperature, it\r\nundergoes a change and carbon dioxide is liberated. The weight of the\r\ngas set free is equal to somewhat less than half the weight of the rock\r\nif the rock is pure. The solid product remaining after the gas has been\r\ndriven off is known as lime. The heating process is called burning.\r\n\r\nBesides being used in making mortar and plaster, lime is valuable in\r\nmany other ways, especially in various chemical processes of modern\r\nindustry. Plants at Chicago and Quincy make lime from Illinois limestone\r\nand dolomite.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 3—An Illinois dolomite quarry.]\r\n\r\n_Cement._—Portland cement, sometimes called simply cement, is made at\r\nLaSalle, Oglesby, and Dixon in northern Illinois from limestone and a\r\nsmaller, carefully measured amount of clay or shale. Cement also is made\r\nat Joppa in southern Illinois. The blend of materials is thoroughly\r\nground and mixed, then heated at a high temperature in huge rotating\r\nhorizontal furnaces, called kilns, until it forms a clinker. After it\r\ncools, the clinker is ground to a flourlike powder. This is basically\r\nthe cement that binds together the mixture of sand and limestone (or\r\ndolomite), or of sand and gravel, to make the concrete from which roads,\r\nbridges, buildings, and other structures are made.\r\n\r\n_Aggregate._—The crushed stone used in making concrete is known as\r\nconcrete aggregate. This is a major use for Illinois limestones and\r\ndolomites. Large amounts of stone aggregate also are used in bituminous\r\nroads, popularly called “blacktop” roads.\r\n\r\n_Agricultural Uses._—Agricultural limestone (agstone) is applied to farm\r\nland to neutralize soil acids and otherwise benefit the soil. Both\r\nlimestone and dolomite are so used. Chickens are fed small limestone\r\nchips to provide calcium for the formation of egg shells. Pigs and cows\r\nget calcium from mineral supplements containing powdered pure limestone.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 4—An underground limestone mine.]\r\n\r\n_Other Uses._—Illinois limestone or dolomite is used in steel making, as\r\nbuilding stone and marble, as road stone, as ballast for the road beds\r\nof railroad tracks, for making refractory dolomite used in the steel\r\nindustry, and for a variety of less common uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Quarries\r\n\r\nThere are about 200 stone quarries in Illinois. Most of the larger\r\nquarries (fig. 3) are in the Chicago, Joliet, Kankakee, and East St.\r\nLouis areas, but one or more limestone or dolomite quarry occurs in many\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\nIf all the stone taken from Illinois quarries in 1963 were removed from\r\na hole 100 feet square, the hole would penetrate into the earth about 8\r\nmiles. It would take more than 350,000 railroad cars holding 100 tons\r\neach to haul away the stone. Limestone, dolomite, and their products\r\nadded over 80 million dollars to the economy of the state in 1963,\r\napproximately 8 dollars for each person in Illinois.\r\n\r\nMost Illinois limestone and dolomite is quarried from open pits, but in\r\nsome places, as in the rocky bluffs along the Mississippi River, the\r\nstone is taken from underground mines (fig. 4). There is also a dolomite\r\nmine in Chicago. At the quarries the first step is the removal of the\r\nearth overlying the stone. Next, in both pit and mine, the stone is\r\nblasted to free it from the parent deposit and break it into pieces.\r\nMechanical shovels (fig. 3) load the stone into trucks that take it to\r\nthe crushing plant where powerful crushers further break the stone into\r\npieces. The pieces are sorted into various sizes by large screens. At\r\nsome of the plants, the stone is ground into powder.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Location of Limestone Deposits\r\n\r\nThe geologic map of Illinois prepared by the Illinois State Geological\r\nsurvey shows, with reasonable exactness, what bedrock formations would\r\ncrop out at the surface if the overlying clay, sand, gravel, and earth\r\nwere removed. Thick dolomite formations would be exposed in much of the\r\nnorthern fifth of the state, but would be rare elsewhere. Thick\r\nlimestone formations would occur in an almost continuous zone, varying\r\nin width from 3 to 25 miles, along the Mississippi River from Rock\r\nIsland to southern Illinois and then eastward across the extreme\r\nsouthern tip of the state. Limestone also would be seen along the\r\nIllinois River from Havana southward.\r\n\r\nIn the central area of the state, limestones are present, but they are\r\nrarely over 25 and often less than 15 feet thick. Consequently, most of\r\nthe larger quarries are in the northern, western, and southern parts of\r\nIllinois. The thinner limestones, nonetheless, are of much importance\r\nand are quarried at many places, chiefly to provide agricultural\r\nlimestone, road stone, and limestone for making cement.\r\n\r\nThe Geological Survey locates and maps limestone and dolomite deposits\r\nand analyzes and tests samples to determine the best possible uses for\r\nthe stone. Many reports have been published about the character and\r\ngeneral use of the deposits in various parts of the state. Other reports\r\ndeal with the use of limestone and dolomite for specific purposes such\r\nas cement making, building and decorative stone, rock wool, terrazzo\r\nchips, and lime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      METALLIC ORES AND FLUORSPAR\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Lead and Zinc\r\n\r\nLead mining was one of the earliest industries of Illinois. The early\r\nsettlers’ need for bullets for procuring food and for defense of their\r\nlives and property made lead an important commodity, and the deposits of\r\nlead ore in the northwestern corner of Illinois were quickly exploited.\r\nThe ore was the mineral galena (fig. 5), for which the city of Galena in\r\nJo Daviess County is believed to have been named.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 5—Galena with cubic cleavage blocks in\r\n    foreground.]\r\n\r\nGalena is a dark, shiny mineral that breaks readily into cubes or\r\ncombinations of cubes. It is composed of lead and sulfur (PbS). Galena\r\nitself is not suitable for use as a metal; the lead must first be\r\nseparated from the sulfur.\r\n\r\nThe earliest method of recovering lead from galena was crude. A pile of\r\nlogs, smaller pieces of wood, and ore was built on sloping ground. Just\r\nbelow it a pit was dug. When the wood was set on fire, the heat caused\r\nthe lead and sulfur to separate, and the molten lead trickled down into\r\nthe pit. The smelting process was later improved, and stone “furnaces”\r\nwere built to house the operations.\r\n\r\n_Crevice Deposits and Residual Deposits._—Most of the lead ore mined in\r\nthe early days of the northwestern Illinois mining district came from\r\ncrevice deposits in the dolomite bedrock and from residual deposits at\r\nor near the surface of the ground. The crevices were vertical narrow\r\njoints or fissures. Ore was not continuously present along them but\r\noccurred from place to place in “pods” (fig. 6 and fig. 7). Dimensions\r\nof the pods varied, but typical ones were about 3 feet wide, 5 feet\r\nhigh, and a few to a few hundred feet long. The galena, for the most\r\npart, occurred in a mixture of clay and weathered dolomite that filled,\r\nor partly filled, the crevices.\r\n\r\nThe residual deposits were found where the action of the weather for\r\nmany thousands of years had dissolved the dolomite from the outcropping\r\nparts of a crevice deposit and left behind a residue of brown or red\r\nclay containing galena.\r\n\r\nSome of the crevice and residual deposits worked by the early miners\r\ncropped out at the surface, but most of them were covered by earth.\r\nOther crevices were exposed in the bluffs of the Mississippi River and\r\nextended back into them for 1,000 feet or more.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 6—Diagrammatic cross section of two crevice\r\n    deposits. A reaches ground surface and is filled with clay; B is\r\n    only partly clay filled. Galena coats parts of the walls and occurs\r\n    as pieces scattered through the clay. Typical crevices are about 3\r\n    feet wide and 5 feet high.]\r\n\r\n  SOIL\r\n  A\r\n    GALENA\r\n    CLAY AND ROTTED DOLOMITE\r\n  B\r\n    GALENA\r\n    CLAY AND ROTTED DOLOMITE\r\n    DOLOMITE\r\n\r\nWhen the richer deposits of ore in the crevices were worked out, some\r\nmines were deepened into the dolomite bedrock, but usually less rather\r\nthan more galena was found.\r\n\r\nAs the amount of galena decreased, however, another mineral, which had\r\nbeen present before in only small amounts, was found in increasing\r\nquantities. This was sphalerite—a yellow, brown, or black mineral of\r\nresinous appearance that is composed of zinc and sulfur (ZnS). It does\r\nnot look like a metallic ore.\r\n\r\nAt first the sphalerite was not used because there were no smelters in\r\nthe area that could separate the zinc from the sulfur with which it was\r\ncombined in the ore. Between 1850 and 1870, however, smelters were built\r\nin northwestern Illinois and southern Wisconsin and the ore was shipped\r\nthere. Sphalerite is now the principal ore mineral produced in\r\nnorthwestern Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe sphalerite and galena of southern Illinois, described later, are\r\nsimilar to that found in northwestern Illinois.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 7—Crevice lead mine. Miner pries ore loose and\r\n    pushes it into car at bottom of crevice. Shiny galena layer occurs\r\n    above his head and another at level of his waist.]\r\n\r\n_Mining and Milling._—One large mine is producing zinc and lead near\r\nGalena at present. Smaller mines operate irregularly. The ore may occur\r\nas pockets, irregularly shaped rather flat masses, vertical or inclined\r\nveins (fig. 8), or small particles scattered through the dolomite. The\r\nprincipal ore bodies that have been worked in recent years have been of\r\nirregular shape, both horizontally and vertically, and usually have been\r\nbetween 50 and 200 feet wide and from a few to as much as 100 feet high.\r\nThey lie at a depth of roughly 300 feet.\r\n\r\nBlasting is required to loosen and break the ore. At the large mine the\r\nore is brought to the surface by a hoist. In some relatively shallow\r\nmines an inclined tunnel has been driven to the ore body and the ore\r\nbrought to the surface in trucks.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 8—Diagrammatic cross section of a zinc ore\r\n    deposit showing flats and pitches. The deposit occurs in limestone\r\n    and dolomite. Much of the ore is a mixture of dolomite, limestone,\r\n    calcite, and sphalerite. Typical dimensions of such a deposit are\r\n    about 30 feet high and 100 to 200 feet wide.]\r\n\r\n  ORE\r\n  PITCHES\r\n  FLATS\r\n\r\nBecause the ore consists of galena and sphalerite attached to and\r\nscattered through dolomite, it must be milled to free and separate the\r\nmetals from the rock. Crushing, grinding, and other operations are\r\ninvolved. The dolomite is discarded and the galena and sphalerite\r\nconcentrates are shipped away to be smelted. No smelters have operated\r\nin the Galena area for some time.\r\n\r\n_Aids to Prospecting._—Finding deposits of ore 300 feet underground is\r\nnot easy. Inspection of the surface usually tells little. To find and\r\noutline a commercial ore deposit many holes often must be drilled to\r\nexplore the unexposed rock strata. Because this is a costly process,\r\nevery possible means is employed to drill the holes where ore is most\r\nlikely to be found. This is where geologists are useful—geologists of\r\nthe mining companies and of the Illinois Geological Survey. Three\r\nexamples of how their investigations help to find ore are given here.\r\n\r\nIt was noted early in the development of the northwestern Illinois\r\nmining district that zinc ore deposits were most common along small\r\ndownfolds in the bedrock, called synclines, that were a few hundred feet\r\nwide and a mile or so long. The synclines were associated with much\r\nlarger synclines that extended for several miles. A map prepared by the\r\nIllinois Geological Survey shows the possible location and extent of\r\nmany of these downfolds and has had much practical use in the selection\r\nof the most promising areas for test drilling to find ore.\r\n\r\nThe Survey also collects the records of borings made by companies and\r\nindividuals in their search for ore. The records are on permanent file\r\nat the Survey offices and are valuable in several ways. Some indicate\r\nwhere no ore was found and where it is, therefore, useless to drill\r\nfurther; others show only traces of ore but suggest that more drilling\r\nin the vicinity might discover a deposit large enough to be mined\r\nprofitably. Still other records are of borings that encountered rich ore\r\nin which mines have been developed.\r\n\r\nThe third aid to prospecting is the study of ore bodies and their\r\nminerals to determine how the deposits were formed. The ore bodies have\r\nbeen and are being studied in the mines. Ore specimens are carefully\r\nexamined in the Survey laboratories. If geologists can learn how the\r\nknown deposits were formed, it may be possible to direct exploration\r\ninto promising new areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Fluorspar\r\n\r\nIn the southeastern tip of Illinois lie deposits of a mineral that\r\ncontains the chemical element fluorine. This element is used in making\r\nthe propellant that activates aerosol sprays, a plastic that resists\r\nchemicals and oil and is strong enough to be used for bearings,\r\ncompounds that are said to help to prevent tooth decay, and many other\r\nuseful chemicals.\r\n\r\nThe mineral is fluorite (fig. 9), commonly called fluorspar. It is\r\ncomposed of calcium fluoride (CaF₂), a compound of calcium and fluorine,\r\nand is a glassy mineral that is generally white or gray but may be\r\npurple, rose, yellow, blue, or green. In rare instances it is colorless.\r\n\r\nFluorspar mining in Hardin and Pope Counties began with lead mining.\r\nGalena was first discovered there in 1839 in a well being dug at the\r\ntown of Rosiclare. Mining of galena began in the early 1840’s, and\r\nsomewhat later ore was being smelted by three furnaces, all of which\r\nhave long since disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe veins that were worked for galena also contained fluorspar, but as\r\nthere was little or no use for fluorspar in the 1840’s it was considered\r\nwaste. In time, uses developed, however, and about 1870 it was mined and\r\nshipped in commercial quantities. Since then the tonnage and value of\r\nthe fluorspar produced from the Rosiclare area have increased until\r\nfluorspar is the major product.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 9—Group of cubic fluorite crystals.]\r\n\r\nThe fluorspar mining district north of the town of Cave in Rock in\r\neastern Hardin County also was an early producer of galena. In that area\r\nthe fluorspar-galena deposits are elongate and approximately flat. The\r\nfirst miners followed the ore bodies from outcrops by tunneling into the\r\nhillsides. In the late 1930’s and early 1940’s, many holes were drilled\r\ninto the bedrock in search of new deposits. Ore was found that contained\r\nnot only galena and fluorspar but also important amounts of sphalerite.\r\n\r\n_Vein Deposits._—In the Rosiclare district, the fluorspar and its\r\naccompanying minerals occur as steeply inclined veins a few inches to 25\r\nfeet or more wide (fig. 10), usually in limestone strata. The veins are\r\nnot uniformly thick but widen or narrow from place to place both\r\nvertically and horizontally. They occur along faults—planes along which\r\nthe rocks of the earth’s crust have broken and slipped. A fault may be a\r\nsingle plane of slippage but more often is a zone of broken and\r\ndisplaced rocks. In most of the faults that contain fluorspar, the\r\nslippage is vertical, or nearly so. Along one of the faults in the\r\nRosiclare district, the rocks on one side of the fault have moved\r\ndownward as much as 650 feet in relation to the rocks on the other side.\r\nSome faults are more than 10 miles long, and the depth to which they\r\nextend into the earth is unknown. Fluorspar has been mined from one of\r\nthem at depths of 800 feet. Not all faults, nor all parts of any one\r\nfault, contain fluorspar.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 10—Diagrammatic cross section of fluorspar\r\n    vein along a fault. The strata on the left side of the fault have\r\n    moved downward with reference to those on the right side.]\r\n\r\n  SOIL\r\n  FAULT\r\n    FLUORSPAR VEIN ALONG FAULT\r\n    down\r\n      SANDSTONE A\r\n      LIMESTONE B\r\n      SHALE C\r\n      SANDSTONE D\r\n      LIMESTONE E\r\n    up\r\n      LIMESTONE B\r\n      SHALE C\r\n      SANDSTONE D\r\n      LIMESTONE E\r\n\r\n_Bedding Deposits._—In contrast to the vein deposits of the Rosiclare\r\ndistrict, the bedding deposits of the Cave in Rock area are flat, or\r\nnearly flat, commonly 5 to 15 feet thick, and from a few to 200 feet\r\nwide (fig. 11). They may be as much as 2000 feet long, widening or\r\nnarrowing and thickening or thinning throughout their extent. They are\r\ncalled bedding deposits because they lie along the beds or layers of the\r\nlimestone in which they occur. Most of the ore bodies are associated\r\nwith a fracture or a small fault.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 11—Diagrammatic cross section of bedding\r\n    deposit of fluorspar, lead, and zinc ore.]\r\n\r\n  SOIL\r\n  SANDSTONE AND SHALE\r\n  ORE\r\n  LIMESTONE\r\n  FRACTURE OR SMALL FAULT\r\n\r\n_Grades and Uses of Fluorspar._—There are three principal grades of\r\nfluorspar—metallurgical, acid, and ceramic. The metallurgical spar is\r\nused as a flux in making steel and in metal foundries. Acid spar is used\r\nto make hydrofluoric acid, which plays a part in the preparation of\r\nuranium isotopes and in the production of a synthetic mineral essential\r\nin refining aluminum. The acid is also used in the production of\r\nhigh-octane gasoline and is the basis for a variety of important\r\nchemical compounds, among them refrigerants and insecticides. Ceramic\r\ngrade fluorspar is used in making enamels, glazes, and certain kinds of\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n_Mining and Milling._—Fluorspar and its associated ores are mined in\r\ndifferent ways in the Rosiclare and Cave in Rock districts because the\r\ntypes of deposits differ. However, in both areas most of the larger\r\nmines are entered by vertical shafts. In the mines, explosives are\r\nplaced in holes drilled by machines and are then detonated to shoot down\r\nthe ore (fig. 12). Mine cars, trucks, or conveyor belts carry the ore to\r\nthe bottom of the mine shaft where hoists raise it to the mills at the\r\nsurface. In the mills a variety of ore-classifying machines separate the\r\ngalena, sphalerite, and fluorspar from the waste mineral materials\r\n(chiefly limestone and calcite) with which they occur. Some fluorspar\r\nafter the separation process is almost flour-fine. To increase its use,\r\nmuch of this spar is mixed with a binder and made into pellets or\r\nbriquets one-half to one inch in size.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 12—Machine loading fluorspar ore in mine near\r\n    Cave in Rock.]\r\n\r\n_Geological and Chemical Studies._—Because much of the fluorspar\r\nproduced in southern Illinois has come from veins along faults,\r\ngeologists have mapped the faults of the area by investigating the\r\ndistribution and nature of the various bedrock outcrops. The work was\r\ncomplicated by the mantle of earth and vegetation that covers the\r\nbedrock at many places. However, a geologic map was made that shows\r\nwhere the various rock formations—sandstone, limestone, and shale—lie\r\nbeneath the surface and where the numerous faults crisscross the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThe first geologic map of the fluorspar district was made in 1920 by the\r\nIllinois and U. S. Geological Surveys. New maps on a much larger scale\r\nhave been made recently by the Illinois Survey to meet the needs of the\r\nmodern fluorspar industry.\r\n\r\nThe Illinois Survey also has studied the ores and ore deposits of\r\nsouthern Illinois to determine how they were formed. The records of many\r\nborings and pits sunk to find ore have been collected and filed at the\r\nSurvey to guide future prospecting.\r\n\r\nSurvey chemists are finding new uses for Illinois fluorspar. Their\r\nresearch has produced new organic fluorine compounds that are being\r\ntested for use in agriculture, medicine, and industry. They also have\r\nworked out easier and cheaper methods of making certain fluorine\r\ncompounds. Survey chemical engineers have helped to obtain needed\r\ninformation about the physical properties of the pellets made from\r\nfluorspar powder.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Origin of Illinois Ore Deposits\r\n\r\nThe ore deposits of northwestern and southern Illinois were formed so\r\nmany millions of years ago that it is possible to propose only theories\r\nof their origin. Most geologists think that the minerals, dissolved in\r\nwarm or hot water, came from deep in the earth. Perhaps the\r\nmineral-bearing water came from, or was associated with, rocks that were\r\nor had been molten (igneous rocks), but it may have had some other\r\nsource. Why the ores occur where we now find them is not fully known.\r\nThe cooling of the solutions and the lessening of pressure as the\r\nsolutions rose toward the surface may have had a part in ore deposition.\r\nFaults and the nature of the rocks encountered by the depositing\r\nsolutions also appear to have had an influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Illinois as a Mining State\r\n\r\nAlthough Illinois is not usually thought of as a mining state,\r\nnorthwestern and southern Illinois together produced in 1963 nearly\r\n$5,000,000 worth of zinc, about $600,000 worth of lead, and $6,500,000\r\nworth of fluorspar. The annual total value is about $12,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe southern Illinois fluorspar district has another distinction—for\r\nmany years its mines have been the major domestic source of the nation’s\r\nfluorspar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SILICA SAND\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout 450,000,000 years ago, a shallow ocean covered Illinois. Its waves\r\nand currents carried clean white sand and deposited it as curving\r\nbeaches, sand bars, and dunes. This sand differed from many sands in\r\nthat it was composed almost exclusively of grains of the mineral quartz\r\ninstead of being a mixture of quartz and other minerals.\r\n\r\nQuartz is composed of silica (SiO₂), and sands such as the ancient\r\nIllinois sand that are composed of quartz are known as silica sands.\r\nQuartz is very hard and will scratch glass and some steel. Perfect\r\nquartz crystals, which are rare, are longer than they are thick and end\r\nin pyramids. Probably not many grains of the ancient sand came from\r\nperfect crystals; they more likely resulted from the decaying and\r\nbreaking down of rocks such as granite, which are mixtures of quartz\r\ngrains and other mineral particles.\r\n\r\nThe quartz grains probably did not come directly from their source to\r\nIllinois. Instead, it is likely they first were deposited elsewhere and\r\nformed into sandstone. That sandstone was subsequently broken down by\r\nweathering agents and the grains transported to the ancient Illinois sea\r\nby streams.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the erosive action of the agents that transported them,\r\nmany of the originally angular grains, particularly the coarser ones,\r\nwere rounded and their surfaces dulled like that of frosted glass (fig.\r\n13). Consequently, they appear white, although they actually are\r\ncolorless.\r\n\r\nSince the ancient sea deposited its silica sand, other seas have covered\r\nIllinois at various times and each has left deposits of sand, mud, or\r\nlimy materials. The silica sand thus was buried by hundreds of feet of\r\nother sediments and became sandstone. This sandstone is called the St.\r\nPeter Sandstone. It is named from the St. Peter River, now the Minnesota\r\nRiver, in Minnesota where the sandstone was first described and named by\r\ngeologists. The overlying deposits also were consolidated into rock.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter Sandstone is exposed at the surface at many places in northern\r\nIllinois and in one small area in the western part of the state. The\r\nsandstone exposed in northern Illinois generally varies from 125 to 300\r\nfeet thick. The fact that it crops out at the surface indicates that the\r\nmaterials that formerly covered it have been removed.\r\n\r\nThe uncovering was not a single, simple event but rather a series of\r\nevents that took place at various times during the many years since the\r\nSt. Peter sand was deposited. Among these was the up-bowing of the rocks\r\nof central northern Illinois into a broad arch. Streams then began to\r\ncut across the arched rock, slowly but persistently stripping away the\r\ntop layers until the core of the arch was laid bare. Among the rocks\r\nthus exposed was the St. Peter Sandstone, which may be seen in northern\r\nIllinois in the valleys and tributaries of the Rock River near Dixon and\r\nOregon and along the Illinois and Fox Rivers and some of their\r\ntributaries near Ottawa, Wedron, Millington, and Troy Grove. The St.\r\nPeter Sandstone at Starved Rock and Matthiessen state parks near LaSalle\r\nand along the highway between Dixon and Oregon is eroded into scenic\r\nbluffs and canyons.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 13—Enlarged photograph of St. Peter sand\r\n    showing the rounded and frosted character of the grains.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Silica Sand Industry\r\n\r\nThe Illinois silica sand industry is based on the St. Peter Sandstone.\r\nIt centers around Ottawa, Wedron, Troy Grove, and Utica in LaSalle\r\nCounty and in Oregon in Ogle County. Two principal grades of silica sand\r\nare produced—washed and crude. The value of the silica sand produced in\r\nIllinois in 1963 was about $9,000,000.\r\n\r\n_Washed Sand._—Although the St. Peter Sandstone is composed almost\r\nentirely of quartz grains, a small amount of clay is present. For some\r\nuses it is not necessary to remove the clay, for others its elimination\r\nis important and is achieved by washing the sand.\r\n\r\nIn the mining of silica sand that is to be washed, the sandstone is\r\nfirst blasted loose from the parent deposit to break it into sand or\r\npieces of various sizes. Some of the larger pieces may require a second\r\nblasting to disintegrate them.\r\n\r\nAt some pits the material is loaded mechanically and transported to the\r\nwashing plant. At others a powerful stream of water is directed against\r\nthe broken sandstone (fig. 14) and the resulting mixture of sand and\r\nwater flows to a collecting basin from which it is pumped through large\r\npipes to the processing mill.\r\n\r\nIn both types of operation the sand is thoroughly washed at the plants.\r\nAfter it is washed, the sand is further processed to suit the needs of\r\nits users. Much of it is screened into different size grades.\r\n\r\n_Uses of Washed Silica Sand._—The washed silica sand produced in\r\nIllinois has many uses, some of which are briefly mentioned below. The\r\nsuitability of the sand for some purposes depends in part on its having\r\nbeen screened to specified sizes.\r\n\r\nThe high purity of Illinois washed silica sand makes it suitable for\r\nmaking glass, which is more than half silica sand. Each year over a\r\nmillion tons is used for this purpose. The purity of the sand also is of\r\nimportance for chemical and metallurgical uses such as the manufacture\r\nof sodium silicate and silicon carbide and in alloying.\r\n\r\nThe hardness of the sand makes it useful for grinding large sheets of\r\nplate glass to prepare them for polishing and also makes it an effective\r\nabrasive agent for sandblasting. Metal castings in foundries and the\r\nexteriors of buildings are cleaned by this process. Illinois produces\r\nthousands of tons of sand yearly for such abrasive purposes.\r\n\r\nBecause the coarser grains of the washed silica sand are rounded,\r\nstrong, and available in uniform sizes, oil operators use thousands of\r\ntons of it annually in the hydraulic fracturing of oil-bearing strata.\r\nThe sand is mixed with oil, other petroleum products, or water and is\r\nforced by powerful pumps into sandstone or limestone formations that\r\ncontain oil. The great force thus exerted opens fractures in the rock\r\nstrata and pushes the liquid and sand into them. When the pressure is\r\nrelieved, the sand grains serve as props to hold the fractures open. The\r\noil can then flow more easily into the wells and oil production is thus\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nThe washed sand, because it is clean and does not dissolve in water, is\r\nused to filter impurities from drinking water. Its whiteness makes it a\r\ndesirable constituent in plaster, mortar, and precast building panels.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 14—Hydraulic mining of silica sand near\r\n    Ottawa.]\r\n\r\nBecause it is round grained and withstands high temperatures without\r\nmelting, large tonnages of the washed silica sand are used to make molds\r\ninto which molten metal is poured to make various kinds of castings.\r\n\r\nA special type of coarse silica sand from Illinois that is carefully\r\nprepared so that it is always of the same grain size is used throughout\r\nthe world as a standard in laboratories that test cement and other\r\ncommercial products.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 15—Loading crude silica sand.]\r\n\r\nSome silica sand is ground to a fine, white powder. The powder, called\r\nground quartz, ground silica, silica flour, or potter’s flint, has many\r\nuses. It is an ingredient in paints, potters use it in making pottery\r\nand china, it goes into scouring powders, into molds used for precision\r\ntypes of metal castings, and into enamels.\r\n\r\n_Crude Silica Sand._—The crude silica sand produced from the St. Peter\r\nSandstone generally is yellow or yellowish white and is not washed\r\nbefore it is used. It probably originally was white, but iron oxide,\r\nsimilar to the rust that forms on iron, now coats many of the sand\r\ngrains and colors the small amount of clay in the sand. Thousands of\r\ntons of crude silica sand are mined annually (fig. 15). Because it is\r\nhighly heat resistant, foundries buy much of it to make the molds used\r\nfor castings, especially steel castings, and for automobile engine\r\nblocks, train wheels, and a variety of other metal products. Crude\r\nsilica sand also is used around industrial furnaces to seal cracks and\r\nopenings to prevent the loss of heat, in certain ceramic products, and\r\nfor adjusting the silica content of the raw materials used for making\r\nportland cement.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Studies of the St. Peter Sandstone\r\n\r\nThe Illinois Geological Survey has made field studies and prepared maps\r\nshowing where the St. Peter Sandstone is exposed in northern and western\r\nIllinois. Many samples have been screened and examined under a\r\nmicroscope to determine how the sand of different deposits, or different\r\nparts of the same deposit, varies in grain size and mineral composition.\r\nThe possibility of using Illinois silica sand for making silica brick\r\nalso has been investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GRAVEL AND SAND\r\n\r\n\r\nSome 225,000 years ago, most of what is now Illinois was buried under\r\nthe ice of the Illinoian glacier. Two earlier glaciers had covered large\r\nparts of Illinois, and another, known as the Wisconsinan glacier, came\r\ninto the state later, about 50,000 to 70,000 years ago (fig. 16).\r\n\r\nThe relatively small glaciers in the United States today, such as those\r\nin the northern Rocky Mountains, are concentrated in valleys and are\r\ncalled valley glaciers. The glaciers that covered Illinois were parts of\r\nhuge ice sheets that extended over much of the North American continent\r\nand are called continental glaciers. They spread over most of Canada,\r\nthen pushed southward to bury New England and a great area in the\r\nnorth-central part of the United States north of the Ohio and Missouri\r\nRivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Formation of Gravel and Sand Deposits\r\n\r\nAs the glacial ice edged slowly southward from Canada, it froze fast to\r\nand picked up soil and loose pieces of rock, with enormous force tore\r\naway huge chunks of bedrock, and mixed and ground these materials\r\ntogether (fig. 17).\r\n\r\nInto Illinois the glacier carried rock materials from Canada, Wisconsin,\r\nMinnesota, and Michigan; other rock fragments were picked up in Illinois\r\nas the ice front advanced. When the glacier melted, it left behind its\r\nload of rock flour and rock fragments, much of it as a gray clay\r\ncontaining pebbles, cobbles, and boulders. Geologists call such deposits\r\nglacial till.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 16—Extent of the exposed deposits of the\r\n    Wisconsinan, Illinoian, and Kansan glaciers in Illinois, and the\r\n    unglaciated areas of the state.]\r\n\r\n  UNGLACIATED\r\n  WISCONSINAN GLACIER\r\n    Freeport\r\n    Fulton\r\n    Peoria\r\n    Decatur\r\n    Charleston\r\n  ILLINOIAN GLACIER\r\n    Kewanee\r\n    Waterloo\r\n    Carbondale\r\n    Harrisburg\r\n  KANSAN GLACIER\r\n  UNGLACIATED\r\n    Hardin\r\n\r\nThe ice in the continental glaciers usually crept forward, sometimes\r\nslowly, sometimes more rapidly. Whether the front of a glacier moved\r\nforward or back depended on the balance between the rate of forward\r\nmotion of the ice and the rate of melting. When the ice advanced faster\r\nthan it melted, the front of the glacier moved forward. When the glacial\r\nice melted faster than it moved forward, the front of the glacier\r\nreceded. When the rates of melting and advance were about equal, the\r\nfront of the glacier stood still or moved back and forth in a narrow\r\nzone.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 17—Striated boulder. Scratches and flattened\r\n    surfaces were caused by abrasion by other rocks while boulder was\r\n    embedded in glacial ice.]\r\n\r\nWhen such a more or less stationary front existed, an enormous amount of\r\nclay, silt, sand, pebbles, and boulders was deposited in a belt only a\r\nfew miles wide along the front of the glacier, creating a line of hills\r\nand ridges that extended for many miles. Such belts, called end\r\nmoraines, can be seen today in many parts of Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe building of end moraines often was accompanied by the release of\r\ngreat quantities of water (meltwater) from the melting ice. The water,\r\nladen with rock debris, flowed from the front of the glacier in many\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nAs the meltwater flowed away from the glacier it sorted its load,\r\nalthough the sorting was rarely perfect. The heavy boulders and pebbles\r\nusually were dropped first, then the sand, next the silt, and finally\r\nthe clay. In general, the farther the deposits were from the glacier the\r\nfiner they were. The major streams frequently carried pebbles 50 to 100\r\nmiles from the glacier and it was many more miles before all the sand\r\nwas dropped. They carried some of the fine silt and clay as far as the\r\nGulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nSometimes the floods of glacial water were greater and flowed faster\r\nthan usual and so were able to carry coarse rock materials farther. As a\r\nresult, gravel was laid down on top of earlier sand deposits. Later\r\nthere may have been further sand deposition.\r\n\r\nThe debris-laden meltwater that flowed into valleys often deposited in\r\nthem a considerable filling of sand and gravel. Some valleys were filled\r\nto a depth of as much as 100 feet. Such deposits are called valley fills\r\nor valley trains. Modern streams have cut their courses into many of\r\nthese fills and even worn away large parts of them. Remnants of valley\r\ntrain deposits are now large terraces or benches along streams, many of\r\nthem well above the present stream channels.\r\n\r\nWhere many small streams flowed from the glacier, they deposited sand\r\nand gravel as a large apron in front of the glacier. Such deposits are\r\ncalled outwash plains and many of them extend for miles.\r\n\r\nTwo other types of sand and gravel deposits made by glacial meltwaters\r\nalso are significant. One was formed where water issued from the front\r\nof a glacier or poured into holes or crevasses in the ice. The sand and\r\ngravel in the water formed a deposit that now appears as a rounded hill\r\nassociated with a terminal moraine and is called a kame. The second type\r\nof deposit was laid down in beds of streams flowing under, through, or\r\non the glaciers and was left as a more or less continuous ridge of sand\r\nand gravel when the ice melted. Such a deposit is called an esker. Some\r\neskers in Illinois are about a quarter of a mile wide and several miles\r\nlong. Typical are the Kaneville Esker northwest of Aurora, the Adeline\r\nEsker south of Freeport, and the Exeter Esker west of Jacksonville.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of both the Illinoian and Wisconsinan glaciers are widely\r\ndistributed throughout the state. Melting of the Illinoian glacier\r\ncaused comparatively little flooding; consequently, extensive gravel\r\ndeposits were formed in only a few places. The ice of the Wisconsinan\r\nglacier, however, melted rapidly and produced great floods laden with\r\nsand and gravel. Thus, most major gravel deposits in Illinois are\r\nrelated to the Wisconsinan glacier.\r\n\r\nWind sweeping across the sand and gravel deposits blew the sand into\r\nhills or sand dunes near such places as Havana, Prophetstown, Kankakee,\r\nand Watseka. Even today the wind shifts sand of long-forgotten glacial\r\nfloods.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Studies of Glacial Deposits\r\n\r\nThe foregoing discussion of glaciers and their deposits is greatly\r\nsimplified. For some time geologists of the Illinois Geological Survey\r\nhave been mapping the moraines, valley trains, outwash plains, and other\r\nglacial deposits of the state. Because the Illinoian and Wisconsinan\r\nglaciers advanced and retreated several times, they built many moraines.\r\nThe Survey has made a map (fig. 18) that shows the complexity of the\r\nmoraines left by the Wisconsinan glacier. They are roughly concentric,\r\nindicating that the general shape of the glacier front remained about\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Principal Commercial Sources of Sand and Gravel\r\n\r\nThe sand and gravel industry is widely distributed throughout Illinois.\r\nThe principal commercial sources of sand and gravel are valley trains\r\nand outwash plains. The Fox, Rock, Illinois, Mississippi, and Wabash\r\nRivers and many smaller streams have terraces in their valleys that are\r\nparts of valley trains. In these deposits are some of the largest sand-\r\nand gravel-producing operations in the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Composition\r\n\r\nAn examination of glacial gravel deposits in Illinois reveals pebbles\r\nand larger pieces of many kinds of rock. Some are gray, others white,\r\npink, brown, or black. They commonly include limestone, dolomite,\r\ngranite, and many rocks with less common names such as quartzite,\r\nschist, and basalt. The limestone and dolomite were picked up by the\r\nglaciers from outcrops in northern Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan.\r\nSome of the granite pebbles resemble outcrops in Wisconsin; others look\r\nlike granite that crops out in Canada. The quartzite probably came from\r\nWisconsin, and black shale fragments found in some gravel deposits came\r\nfrom the floor of Lake Michigan or from western Michigan. Occasionally\r\npieces of metallic copper are found that probably had their source in\r\nthe Lake Superior copper-bearing area.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the sand associated with gravel deposits, extensive\r\ndeposits of sand alone are found at many places in Illinois. Most of the\r\nsand grains are pieces of minerals that were constituents of rocks until\r\nweathering, the grinding action of the glaciers, and other erosive\r\nagencies broke the rocks into sand. The principal mineral in glacial\r\nsand is quartz, but many others occur in lesser amounts, including\r\ncalcite, dolomite, feldspar, pyroxene, tourmaline, garnet, magnetite,\r\nand hornblende. Most of these are foreign to Illinois, although the\r\ncalcite and dolomite may be native.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 18—Moraines left by Wisconsinan glacier.]\r\n\r\n  Modified from George E. Ekblaw, 1960\r\n  _ILLINOIS STATE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY_\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 19—Gravel dredge, with plant for processing\r\n    the gravel in background.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Uses of Sand and Gravel\r\n\r\nIn 1963 more than 27 million tons of sand and gravel, directly or\r\nindirectly of glacial origin, was sold by Illinois producers for almost\r\n25 million dollars. The sand alone would have filled a child’s sand box,\r\nwith an area of 8 square miles, to a depth of 1 foot. The gravel would\r\nhave covered an even larger area.\r\n\r\nThe gravel was used in making concrete for roads and buildings, for\r\nsurfacing roads, for ballast for railroad tracks, and for other\r\npurposes. The sand found its way into plaster, mortar, concrete, and a\r\nvariety of other products and uses. Some of it was produced for use as\r\nmolding sand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Production of Sand and Gravel\r\n\r\nThe production of sand and gravel from its deposits may be a relatively\r\nsimple operation or one of considerable complexity. Gravel for surfacing\r\na road may be dug from a conveniently located pit and loaded\r\nmechanically into trucks that haul it to the road. A large sand- and\r\ngravel-producing operation, however, may include not only mechanical\r\nequipment to load and transport the material but also a processing plant\r\nwhere it can be washed if necessary and screened to various sizes.\r\n\r\nIn a “dry pit” operation, mechanical cranes or shovels pick up the\r\ngravel and sand and load it into trucks, railroad cars, or conveyor\r\nbelts to be transferred to the processing plant. There clay and dirt may\r\nbe washed out and the sand and gravel is sized by screens. Conveyor\r\nbelts carry sand and gravel to the various processing operations and to\r\nstorage bins or piles on the ground.\r\n\r\nA “wet pit” operation produces sand and gravel from an artificial pond\r\nor lake. In some operations the sand and gravel is mined by a dredge\r\nthat floats on the water (fig. 19). In some pits, a stream of water is\r\ndirected from the dredge against the bank of gravel to wash the gravel\r\ninto the lake. A large metal pipe at the front of the dredge slants down\r\ninto the water and sucks up the sand and gravel from the underwater part\r\nof the deposit. The gravel, sand, and water is then pumped through a\r\npipe at the rear of the dredge to the processing plant on the shore.\r\n\r\nIn some types of wet pit operations a large scoop or bucket operated\r\nfrom a crane on the shore, or by cables fastened to the shore, is used\r\nto dig sand and gravel from beneath the water.\r\n\r\nDredges are used to pump up sand and gravel from the beds of Illinois\r\nrivers, especially the Mississippi, Ohio, and Wabash.\r\n\r\nThe sand and gravel resources of many parts of the state have been\r\nmapped and studied by the Illinois Geological Survey, and work of this\r\nkind is continuing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    SILICA (TRIPOLI) AND OTHER MINERAL MATERIALS OF EXTREME SOUTHERN\r\n                                ILLINOIS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hills of extreme southern Illinois contain several mineral materials\r\nthat are entirely or largely restricted, in important quantities, to\r\nthat part of the state. Some of them, such as silica and novaculite,\r\ncome directly from bedrock deposits of great age; others, such as some\r\nof the sands and gravels, are of more recent origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Silica (Tripoli)\r\n\r\nA mineral material unique in Illinois is the amorphous silica, or\r\ntripoli, mined in the hills of southern Illinois about 20 miles north of\r\nCairo.\r\n\r\nMost of the silica mines are found at the heads of valleys or in\r\ntree-covered hill slopes along the less traveled roads. An arched\r\nopening (fig. 20) with a road leading into it may be all that is visible\r\nof the mine from the outside. Inside are many rooms, some 30 feet high,\r\nseparated by rounded pillars about 20 feet thick that have been left to\r\nsupport the arched mine roof.\r\n\r\nMost of the silica in the mines is white, and this is the part that is\r\nmined. A silica deposit is made up of layers—some of white, powdery rock\r\nmaterial, others that look chalky but are firm or hard.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 20—Entrance to a silica mine.]\r\n\r\nIn the mines the silica is blasted loose from the natural deposit and\r\nloaded into trucks that take it to the processing mills at Elco and\r\nTamms, where it is crushed and then transferred to huge grinding mills\r\nthat pulverize it to a very fine powder. Air currents of different\r\nvelocities separate the powder into various grades of fineness, and the\r\nfinished silica goes into large paper bags for shipment.\r\n\r\n_Origin of Silica._—Some of the history of the formation of silica\r\ndeposits is not fully known, but it seems probable that their original\r\ncharacter was quite different from what it is today. Investigations by\r\nSurvey geologists suggest that the parent rock formation was limestone\r\nand chert. The limestone was composed of the mineral calcite, but\r\nscattered through it were myriads of small particles of quartz.\r\nInterlayered with it were bands and beds of chert that contained varying\r\namounts of calcite.\r\n\r\nAs the rocks above them were worn away by the ceaseless erosion of\r\nstreams and rivers, these original deposits were uncovered. Rain and\r\nsnow-water then worked down into the limestone and chert deposits\r\nthrough cracks and crevices and dissolved the calcite in the rock. The\r\nquartz remained because it is much less soluble than the calcite. After\r\nmany thousands of years all the calcite had been removed, leaving behind\r\na “skeleton” of quartz—the silica deposits of today.\r\n\r\n_Uses of Silica._-The silica mined and milled in southern Illinois has\r\nmany uses. A superfine grade, known as white rouge, is used to polish\r\noptical lenses. Other grades are used in scouring compounds, metal\r\npolishes, paints, electrical resistors, high-temperature pipe coverings,\r\nfiberglass manufacture, plastics, silicone rubber, wood filler, caulking\r\ncompounds, ceramic products, floor tile, billiard cue chalk, as foundry\r\nparting or facing, concrete admixture, in the manufacture of buffing\r\ncompounds that are used to polish metal objects, and for other purposes.\r\nIndustry uses many thousands of tons of silica each year.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Chert and Chert Gravel\r\n\r\nDeposits of chert, chert gravel, and ganister also are among the variety\r\nof mineral materials found in extreme southern Illinois. Chert consists\r\nprincipally of minutely crystalline particles of quartz. Some chert is\r\npopularly called flint. In southern Illinois chert occurs in two\r\nprincipal kinds of deposits, those composed of solid ledges and those\r\nconsisting of gravel. The term novaculite is used in southern Illinois\r\nfor those solid deposits that are white, comparatively thick, and free\r\nof other interlayered materials. No novaculite is mined at present, but\r\nit is said to have been sold in past years for making sodium silicate\r\nand silica brick.\r\n\r\nThe chert gravels of southern Illinois are of three kinds—novaculite\r\ngravel, Elco gravel, and “Lafayette” Gravel. The novaculite and Elco\r\ngravels consist of fragments of chert plus lesser amounts of fine silica\r\nparticles and clay. The chert fragments of the novaculite gravel are\r\nangular, but the Elco gravel includes both angular and rounded\r\nfragments. These gravels are white, yellow, brown, or reddish brown, the\r\nnovaculite gravel usually being the more highly colored. Deposits in\r\nUnion and Alexander Counties have been used for road surfacing and other\r\npurposes. Deposits of chert gravel also occur in Hardin and Saline\r\nCounties, and some stream valleys in southern and western Illinois also\r\ncontain such gravel.\r\n\r\n“Lafayette” Gravel consists principally of brown chert pebbles. Most of\r\nthe pebbles are rounded and have a smooth, semi-polished surface. The\r\nsand and clay occurring with the gravel are brown or dark red. In some\r\nplaces there are deposits of coarse, red quartz sand. The gravel is most\r\nabundant in the four southernmost counties of the state, and deposits\r\nmay be as much as 65 feet thick. It is used principally as a\r\nroad-surfacing material.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Ganister\r\n\r\nGanister occurs in the hills of Alexander and Union Counties and is a\r\nloosely consolidated, granular material consisting of irregular\r\nparticles up to about an inch in diameter or of masses of material\r\nreadily disintegrated into such particles. The particles are composed\r\nmainly of fine crystalline quartz. Ganister is white, cream, light\r\nyellow, or red and occurs in deposits up to 25 feet or more thick.\r\nRelatively small tonnages of the light colored ganister are now used,\r\nprincipally in making refractories, but ganister is said to have been\r\nmore widely used in that field in the past. It is produced from\r\nunderground mines. Some red ganister, or ganister like material, mined\r\nfrom open pits has been used for road surfacing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Studies of Southern Illinois Materials\r\n\r\nSurvey geologists have mapped the chert- and silica-bearing formations\r\nof Alexander and Union Counties and also many of the various kinds of\r\ngravel deposits. Samples have been tested to determine their chemical\r\ncomposition and the size of the particles composing them. Laboratory\r\nstudies by ceramists indicate that novaculite and novaculite gravel,\r\nwhen suitably processed, can be used for making silica brick, which\r\nwithstands great heat. Canister and the gravels of southern Illinois\r\noffer a variety of raw materials awaiting increased industrial use.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Sands of Extreme Southern Illinois\r\n\r\nIn southern Illinois deposits of sand laid down in an arm of the ocean\r\nthat once extended northward into Illinois from the Gulf of Mexico are\r\nfound in Alexander, Union, Pulaski, Pope, and Massac Counties. The\r\ndeposits are commonly a light color—white, cream, yellow, or gray.\r\n\r\nThe grains of the sand are almost all quartz and generally are angular.\r\nSome of the sands are of almost powder-like fineness, others are fine or\r\nmedium grained. Many of the sands contain flakes of white mica, a\r\nglistening, silvery-looking mineral often mistaken for silver or\r\nplatinum. Unlike these metals, however, mica is comparatively light in\r\nweight and is not metallic. Also present in some sands are small flakes\r\nof the mineral graphite.\r\n\r\nThe southern Illinois sands have not been widely used, but some of them\r\nhave been employed in making concrete. They also may have possibilities\r\nfor molding and core sand.\r\n\r\nAs a result of work by Survey geologists, the location and properties of\r\nmany of the southern Illinois sand deposits are known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CLAY AND SHALE\r\n\r\n\r\nMan has used clay in various ways for many hundreds of years. From it he\r\nmade, and still makes, bricks to build his dwellings, pottery utensils\r\nof many kinds, and other useful products.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows what clay is, yet it is a substance difficult to define.\r\nAll clays are earth materials, most of them plastic or sticky when wet\r\nbut firm when dry. If heated sufficiently (fired) they become hard.\r\n\r\nClays are composed of various minerals. Of these, the so-called clay\r\nminerals—complex substances composed mostly of alumina, silica, and\r\nwater—generally are the most important. They impart the property of\r\nplasticity and also cause clays to become hard when fired.\r\n\r\nMost clays are what geologists call unindurated (unhardened) rocks. Clay\r\nthat has been indurated and occurs in layered deposits is commonly\r\ncalled shale. The layers may be from a fraction of an inch to several\r\ninches thick. Most Illinois shales are not plastic when dug from freshly\r\nexposed deposits, but they become plastic when crushed and kneaded with\r\nwater. The clays and shales of Illinois are the basis of a huge and\r\nimportant industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Early Uses in Illinois\r\n\r\nClays and shales are useful because they can be made plastic by adding\r\nwater, formed into desired shapes, and fired to a rock like hardness. As\r\na result, various kinds of bricks, drain tile, pottery, and other useful\r\nproducts are made from them. In its early years, Illinois had many\r\nwidely distributed potteries that used clay from nearby deposits to make\r\na variety of jugs, crocks, and bowls that served in place of many\r\npresent-day glass or metal articles.\r\n\r\nDrain tile has been of major importance in the development of the state.\r\nEarly settlers found many low lying, swampy areas and tracts of land\r\nthat drained poorly after heavy rains. Ditches were dug to carry away\r\nthe water from some areas, but others were drained by means of drain\r\ntile—pieces of fired clay pipe several inches in diameter and about a\r\nfoot long that were laid end to end in trenches below plough depth and\r\nthen covered with earth. Water seeped into the tile, which discharged it\r\ninto ditches. Tile factories, built throughout Illinois near clay or\r\nshale deposits, did an active business. Gradually, however, as more and\r\nmore farm land was drained the demand slackened and many tile factories\r\nwent out of business. Although there are fewer factories, much drain\r\ntile is still manufactured in Illinois.\r\n\r\nMany of the early tile plants also made bricks to be used for making\r\nfoundations, buildings, sidewalks, and other structures. The bricks were\r\nmade by hand-operated equipment. Some of the old hand-molded bricks may\r\nstill be seen in older buildings. Now the brick-making process is highly\r\nmechanized and even though there are fewer plants they produce more\r\nbricks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Clay and Shale Deposits\r\n\r\nIllinois shales are a part of the bedrock—that is, they are associated\r\nwith indurated rocks such as sandstone and limestone. Most clays are\r\nsurficial rocks occurring in deposits near the surface, where they lie\r\nabove the bedrock. Exceptions are certain clays found in extreme\r\nsouthern Illinois and the underclays, also called fireclays, that occur\r\nbeneath coal seams and are part of the bedrock.\r\n\r\nThe surficial clays are of two principal kinds—till and loess. Till is a\r\ndeposit left by glaciers. It is a gray, blue-gray, or brown clay\r\ncontaining varying amounts of sand, pebbles, cobbles, and even boulders.\r\nTill is found at many places in the state and is used for brick making,\r\nespecially in the Chicago area.\r\n\r\nLoess is a wind-deposited silty clay or clayey silt and is found in many\r\nparts of Illinois. It is thickest on or near the bluffs of the\r\nMississippi, Illinois, and Ohio Rivers. It generally is brown and stands\r\nin steep faces in roadcuts and other excavations. It once was widely\r\nused for making brick and tile.\r\n\r\nOf major importance in making clay products in Illinois are the bedrock\r\nshales and the clays associated with the coal-bearing rocks that\r\nunderlie much of the state. The shales, and the clays to a lesser\r\nextent, are dug at many places for making structural clay products such\r\nas bricks, structural tile, and drain tile. They also are used to make\r\nlightweight aggregate for concrete. The underclays of some of the older\r\ncoal seams are used to make buff-colored brick, stoneware, and a highly\r\nheat-resistant brick (firebrick) that is used in industrial furnaces or\r\nin other operations involving high temperatures. Some fireclay, ground\r\nas fine as flour, is added to molding sand to make it coherent enough to\r\nform into molds for metal casting. Sewer pipe and flue lining also are\r\nmade from underclays.\r\n\r\nClays unlike those found elsewhere in the state occur in extreme\r\nsouthern Illinois. One of these has the property of removing color from\r\noils and was so used at one time by petroleum refineries. Another,\r\nkaolin, was extensively used during World War I for making crucibles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Clay Minerals\r\n\r\nThe uses of clay and shale are determined to a large degree by the\r\nproperties of their clay minerals and to a lesser degree by the\r\nimpurities present. A clay or shale containing the clay mineral illite,\r\nand other similar but less important clay minerals, commonly becomes red\r\nwhen fired and gets hard at a relatively low temperature. It therefore\r\nis used to make red bricks, drain tile, building tile, and other\r\nstructural clay products.\r\n\r\nAnother clay mineral, kaolinite, generally burns to a light color and is\r\ndifficult to fuse. Therefore, clays composed wholly or mainly of\r\nkaolinite can be used for making buff or light-colored bricks and for\r\nthe manufacture of highly heat-resistant (refractory) bricks.\r\n\r\nThe clay mineral in the southern Illinois clay that was used to\r\ndecolorize oil is montmorillonite. This clay is now used in sweeping\r\ncompounds, as an oil absorbent, as animal litter, and for other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Studies of Clay and Shale\r\n\r\nIn view of the significant relationship between the clay minerals and\r\nthe utilization of the clays and shales in which they occur, the\r\nIllinois Geological Survey has investigated extensively the clay\r\nminerals in the clay and shale deposits of Illinois. Many samples were\r\nstudied by means of powerful microscopes, X-ray, and chemical analysis.\r\nMost of the surface clays and shales proved to be composed principally\r\nof illite or related minerals. The kaolin clay of extreme southern\r\nIllinois contains the mineral kaolinite. The older underclays also\r\ncontain kaolinite, but many of them also contain smaller amounts of\r\nillite.\r\n\r\nThe Survey also has tested many clays to determine their burning\r\nproperties and color when fired, and hence their potential uses. The\r\nbonding capabilities of other clays have been measured to find out\r\nwhether they can be used as a bonding material for molding sand. The\r\nbloating properties of Illinois clays and shales from many deposits have\r\nbeen studied to determine which are suitable for making lightweight\r\naggregate for the manufacture of concrete.\r\n\r\nThe object of these studies has been to discover the location,\r\ncharacter, and possible uses of the state’s clay and shale resources.\r\nSpecial studies are continuing in several parts of the state. Illinois\r\nis well endowed with clays and shales that can be used for a variety of\r\npurposes and has resources to fill future as well as present needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          How Bricks Are Made\r\n\r\nConversion of Illinois clays and shales into useful products is an\r\ninteresting process and is exemplified by the making of building bricks.\r\nMechanical shovels dig the clay or shale and load it into trucks or\r\nsmall railroad cars that take it to the brick plant. There, machines\r\ngrind the raw material and mix water with it until it has the\r\nconsistency of stiff mud.\r\n\r\nNext, a machine, which operates somewhat like a meat grinder, extrudes a\r\nbrick-sized column of clay. As the column moves forward, it is\r\nautomatically cut into bricks by wires. The bricks are then dried in\r\nlarge heated rooms.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 21—Beehive brick kiln.]\r\n\r\nFrom the driers, the bricks go to huge ovens (kilns) and are heated\r\nuntil they are hard and have attained the desired color. This is known\r\nas firing or burning the bricks. Temperatures employed are rarely lower\r\nthan 1800° F.\r\n\r\nThree kinds of kilns are used in Illinois for burning bricks—beehive,\r\ntunnel, and scove. A beehive kiln (fig. 21) has a round base and a\r\ndome-shaped top and somewhat resembles an oversized beehive. Unfired\r\nbricks are stacked in the kiln and the doors are sealed with burned\r\nbricks and clay. Fires are started in hearths or fire boxes in the wall\r\nof the kiln and the heat is circulated into and through the kiln. It\r\nusually takes several days to fire the bricks adequately and let the\r\nkiln cool so that the bricks can be removed.\r\n\r\nTunnel kilns, made from heat-resistant bricks, are actually tunnels big\r\nenough for a man to stand in. The unburned bricks are loaded on flat\r\nsteel cars on top of a layer of refractory blocks that protect the steel\r\nfrom the heat. The cars enter the kiln and heating begins. As they move\r\nthrough the kiln, they carry the bricks through a firing area, then\r\nthrough a cooling zone, and finally out into the air.\r\n\r\nIn some brickyards in the Chicago area, dried unburned bricks are\r\ncarefully stacked by machines into piles about 17 feet high, 35 feet\r\nwide, and 115 feet long, which are known as scoves or scove kilns. A\r\nlayer of burned bricks that is plastered with clay covers the sides of\r\nthe scove. A jet of flame is directed through small tunnels at the base\r\nof the scove, and the heat fires the bricks.\r\n\r\nDuring 1963, more than 325,000,000 bricks were produced by Illinois\r\nbrick plants. In the same year, the value of all the clay and clay\r\nproducts produced in Illinois was nearly $54,000,000. Besides brick and\r\ndrain tile, the products of the clay and shale industry of Illinois\r\ninclude refractory brick, building block and tile, fire-proofing, sewer\r\npipe, flue liners, stoneware, lightweight bloated burned clay aggregate\r\nfor concrete, and a variety of unburned clays for special purposes,\r\nincluding bonding clay, refractory fireclays, absorbent for use on\r\ngarage floors, and litter for animal cages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  PEAT\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the retreat of the last of the great ice sheets from Illinois,\r\nnumerous ponds and lakes were left in northern Illinois, especially in\r\nthe eastern section. Some of them were soon drained by natural\r\nprocesses, but others remained. In the shallow water along their shores\r\ngrew various plants, chiefly reeds and sedges and, locally, a variety of\r\nmoss. As the plants died, their partially decomposed remains were\r\npreserved beneath the water. Ultimately, the ponds and lakes were\r\novergrown and more or less completely filled by the plants and their\r\nremains, giving rise to peat (fig. 22) bogs.\r\n\r\nSome peat bogs have been drained and are now used as farm land. Others\r\nremain and a few of them are the source of peat or humus for\r\nhorticultural purposes. Producing operations are located in northeastern\r\nIllinois and in Whiteside County in northwestern Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        OTHER MINERAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the future, new uses will be made of the Illinois industrial minerals\r\nalready discussed. In addition, other mineral resources of the state\r\nthat are not now being used may be the bases of new mineral industries.\r\nSome of these minerals are at present too costly to mine because the\r\ndeposits are deeply buried or are not sufficiently rich to be worked at\r\na profit. Others are not convenient to markets, and still others have no\r\npresent commercial use. In years to come, however, changes may occur\r\nthat will make it practical to mine, process, and use some of these\r\nresources. Furthermore, some other mineral deposits that are now being\r\nutilized in a limited way may have greater future use. The Illinois\r\nGeological Survey continues to study the location, character, and\r\ncomposition of many such mineral materials and is alert for the\r\ndevelopment of new uses. Some of the materials are discussed briefly\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 22—Peat from Kane County showing its fibrous\r\n    nature and remains of plants.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Gypsum and Anhydrite\r\n\r\nGypsum is a mineral that consists of calcium sulfate plus two molecules\r\nof water (CaSO₄·2H₂O). By suitably heating it, the amount of water can\r\nbe reduced, and a product called calcined gypsum (plaster of paris)\r\nresults. This material changes back to gypsum if mixed with an\r\nappropriate quantity of water. The ability of calcined gypsum to “set”\r\nwhen water is added makes it important in the manufacture of a variety\r\nof plasters and related products, especially building materials. Gypsum\r\nalso is used in cement making and in agriculture.\r\n\r\nAnhydrite (CaSO₄) is like gypsum except that it contains no water and\r\nhence cannot be made into plaster of paris. Its uses are limited in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWells that were drilled for oil, water, or coal have encountered gypsum\r\nand/or anhydrite in some parts of south-central Illinois, but the gypsum\r\nand anhydrite are not known to crop out at the surface. A study of\r\ndiamond drill cores and well cuttings on file at the Survey showed that\r\nthe shallowest gypsum and anhydrite reported occurred at a depth of 470\r\nfeet in Madison County. The greatest continuous thickness of gypsum\r\nfound was 2 feet; but in one well, over 6 feet of strata was penetrated\r\nthat averaged almost 75 percent gypsum. It is possible that thicker\r\ndeposits of gypsum might be found if drilling were done especially in\r\nsearch of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Feldspar-Bearing Sands\r\n\r\nFeldspar is the name applied to a group of minerals that are mainly\r\nsilicates of potassium, sodium, and calcium. Various kinds of feldspar\r\nare used industrially in making glass, enamels, pottery, and other\r\nproducts. All the feldspar now used in Illinois is shipped into the\r\nstate. The discovery by the Illinois Survey that some Illinois sands\r\ncontain considerable feldspar led Survey geologists and chemists to find\r\nwhere deposits highest in feldspar occur, what kinds of feldspar they\r\ncontain, and whether it could be separated from the sand in which it\r\noccurs. Beach sands, river sands, dune sands, and sands from other kinds\r\nof deposits were studied.\r\n\r\nIt was found that many sands contain more than 15 percent feldspar and\r\nsome as much as 25 percent. Means of separating the feldspar from the\r\nsand are believed to exist, but problems relating to the purity of the\r\nseparated spar remain to be solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Brines\r\n\r\nNo salt is now produced in Illinois, but at one time the state was a\r\nmajor salt producer. Salt works were in operation near Equality, Central\r\nCity, Murphysboro, St. John, Danville, and possibly other places. The\r\nsalt was obtained by evaporating salt water (brine) that came from\r\nnatural springs or from wells. The Equality area was a particularly\r\nimportant producer of salt in the 1800’s. Discovery elsewhere in the\r\nMiddle West of deposits of rock salt and brines that contained more salt\r\nthan those of Illinois is said to have been responsible for the\r\ndiscontinuance of salt making in the state.\r\n\r\nNo salt beds crop out in Illinois, nor are any known to have been\r\nencountered in the many wells that have been drilled for coal, oil, or\r\nwater. However, most oil well drilling encounters brines containing\r\nvarious amounts and kinds of salts, including the common table salt,\r\nsodium chloride.\r\n\r\nFor reasons relating to the production of oil, Survey geologists and\r\nchemists have collected and analyzed many samples of Illinois oil field\r\nbrines, and data are therefore available on their salt content. No\r\ncommercial use is being made of the brines as sources of salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Oil Shale\r\n\r\nIllinois has a large oil-producing industry that obtains oil from wells.\r\nThe state also contains beds of shale that yield oil when the shale is\r\nheated.\r\n\r\nIn order to estimate the present and future importance of the oil shale\r\nresources, the Survey collected and tested more than 100 shale samples\r\nfrom 41 Illinois counties. A few samples contained more than 25 gallons\r\nof oil per ton of shale, but most contained less than 15 gallons per\r\nton. A study of the crude oil distilled from selected shale samples\r\nshowed it to be somewhat different from the oil that comes from wells.\r\nIt could, nevertheless, be made to yield gasoline, fuel oil, and other\r\nproducts if suitably processed.\r\n\r\nThe shale strata generally the richest in oil are found above coal\r\nseams, are black, and are sometimes called slate by coal miners. They\r\nare rarely more than 3 feet thick, but they extend over large areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Sandstone\r\n\r\nSandstone has a long history of use in Illinois. Pioneers built\r\nfoundations for their houses and barns and curbs around their wells from\r\nit. Slabs of sandstone were once a popular material for sidewalks, some\r\nof which are still in use. Churches and other sizable buildings have\r\nbeen constructed from it, and at one time an Illinois sandstone was used\r\nto make grindstones. Except for the St. Peter Sandstone, which was\r\ndiscussed under “Silica Sand,” the use of sandstone has decreased,\r\nalthough comparatively small quantities are still used as building\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nMost Illinois sandstones may be thought of as a mass of sand whose\r\ngrains are more or less firmly cemented together by clay, iron oxide,\r\nand quartz, either singly or in combination, or, less commonly, by\r\ncalcite. The grains are particles of various minerals, but most of them\r\nare quartz.\r\n\r\nSandstones are especially common in the hill country of extreme southern\r\nIllinois. The Survey’s investigations in this area revealed that if they\r\nare suitably processed some of the sandstones may have possibilities for\r\ncommercial use. Sandstones in other parts of the state also have been\r\nstudied, with similar conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Barite\r\n\r\nBarite (barium sulfate, BaSO₄) is a deceptive mineral—it is much heavier\r\nthan it looks. Barite found in Illinois is generally white or light\r\ncolored, and, although some of it looks rather like white limestone, it\r\nis more than half again as heavy as limestone. Barite’s unusual weight\r\nis responsible for one of its major uses—as a constituent of drilling\r\nmuds for the oil industry. These muds are a mixture of clay, water, and\r\na weighting material such as barite. They are used in various ways in\r\nthe drilling of oil wells by rotary drills. Barite also is an important\r\nraw material for the manufacture of chemicals.\r\n\r\nBarite is found in Hardin and Pope Counties, the site of the fluorspar\r\nindustry. According to studies made by Survey geologists, the barite\r\noccurs both as veins and beds associated with fluorspar, but its\r\ndistribution is irregular and the deposits are of limited size. A barite\r\nmine is said to have been worked years ago, and more recently\r\ncomparatively small tonnages have been taken from open pits. Future\r\nexploration in southern Illinois may reveal deposits of barite that will\r\nbe profitable to mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Greensand\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Illinois occur sands or sandstone that contain numerous\r\ngrains of the green mineral glauconite. If the sands are not discolored\r\nby iron compounds or other substances, they too have a greenish color\r\nand, therefore, are called greensands. Glauconite varies in composition\r\nbut contains potassium, magnesium, iron, aluminum, silicon, and water.\r\nGreensand is said to be used in relatively small amounts as a soil\r\nconditioner and as a water-softening agent.\r\n\r\nGreensand is known to occur in the general vicinity of Olmsted in\r\nsouthern Illinois. Near Oregon in northern Illinois an old quarry\r\nexposed 10 feet of greenish brown sandstone that contains glauconite.\r\nSamples from southern Illinois and from the sandstone at Oregon\r\ncontained more than 6 percent potassium oxide.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Marl\r\n\r\nIn some of the lakes and ponds left by the glaciers lived numerous small\r\nmollusks with calcium carbonate shells. As the animals died, their\r\nshells formed a deposit on the bottom of the lakes and ponds. Certain\r\nplants, especially algae, may have added a mudlike precipitate of\r\ncalcium carbonate to the deposits, and varying amounts of clay washed\r\nfrom the shores mixed with both these materials. The resultant deposit\r\nis called marl. Some marl deposits have peat mixed with them, and peat\r\nalso overlies some marl deposits.\r\n\r\nOnly comparatively small amounts of marl are known to have been dug in\r\nIllinois. One deposit containing many shells and shell fragments, some\r\nof it associated with peat, was worked in southeastern Livingston County\r\nas a source of agricultural liming material. Other deposits have been\r\nreported at other places in northeastern Illinois. The available\r\ninformation indicates that the marl deposits are likely to be\r\nprincipally of local importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Tufa and Travertine\r\n\r\nThe tufa (fig. 23) and travertine occurring as surficial deposits in\r\nIllinois were formed by springs. The deposits usually occur at or near\r\nthe outcrop of a layer of porous water-bearing earth material, such as\r\ngravel, sandstone, or fissured limestone, that is underlain by a\r\nnonporous clay or shale formation. Water moving down through the porous\r\nlayer cannot sink through the clay or shale and so is forced to move\r\nlaterally. Where valleys have cut into the layers of gravel or rock, the\r\nwater emerges as springs.\r\n\r\nIf the material through which the water has passed is limestone, or\r\ngravel containing limestone as most Illinois gravels do, some of the\r\nlimestone is likely to have dissolved in the water. When the water\r\nissues as a spring, conditions may be such as to cause precipitation of\r\nthe dissolved limestone as tufa or, more rarely, travertine.\r\n\r\nTufa is generally highly porous and more or less impure, whereas\r\ntravertine is harder and less porous.\r\n\r\nThe middle or lower slopes of bluffs are common sites for\r\nspring-deposited tufa or travertine. Deposits have been seen in various\r\nparts of Illinois, but are not known to have been worked, except in\r\nCalhoun County where small quantities of tufa were produced for use as\r\nagricultural limestone. It is thought that the tufa and travertine\r\ndeposits of Illinois are relatively small, but they may be of local\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 23—Calcareous tufa from Pike County. In\r\n    addition to the large visible pores there are numerous tiny ones.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Pyrite and Marcasite\r\n\r\nThe mineral pyrite consists of iron and sulfur as the compound iron\r\nsulfide (FeS₂) and, because of its shiny, brassy yellow color, is\r\nsometimes called fool’s gold. Marcasite has the same composition as\r\npyrite, but its crystals have a different shape and it is often lighter\r\ncolored. Both minerals occur in various parts of the state; they are\r\nparticularly prevalent in some coal seams, and when so occurring are in\r\nsome cases called coal brasses or “sulfur.”\r\n\r\nPyrite and marcasite are used commercially as raw materials for making\r\nsulfuric acid, although sulfur itself is more extensively used for that\r\npurpose. At one time coal brasses recovered during coal-cleaning\r\noperations at a northwestern Illinois coal mine were sold for acid\r\nmaking. A large quantity of coal brasses probably could be recovered\r\nfrom such operations at Illinois coal mines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Uranium\r\n\r\nUranium has been sought in Illinois by many people in recent years. The\r\nGeological Survey also carried out a wide search for uranium and\r\nparticular attention was paid to certain clays and other rocks in Hardin\r\nCounty and certain black shales in other parts of the state.\r\n\r\nAbout 200 samples from Hardin County and 175 samples of the shales were\r\ntested by the Survey. No deposits were found that are known to be of the\r\nrequired richness and quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Iron Ore\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the 19th century two furnaces in Hardin County in\r\nextreme southern Illinois for a time produced iron from local limonite\r\nores. The ore is said to have occurred as pellets, chunks, and masses\r\nscattered through soil and clay and apparently was of irregular\r\ndistribution. Little can be seen of the deposits today. Their extent is\r\nnot known, but they are believed to be of limited size.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Illinois State Geological Survey carries on a continuous program of\r\nresearch on the industrial minerals and metals of Illinois and their\r\nuses.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the investigations mentioned in this booklet, many others\r\nhave been made or are in progress. Such studies are necessarily a\r\ncontinuing activity if the full potentialities of Illinois mineral\r\nresources are to be realized, for industry continually demands new raw\r\nmaterials and changes its requirements for those now used.\r\n\r\nThe Survey has issued numerous reports that deal with the resources\r\ndiscussed here and mimeographed lists of these are available upon\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf reproduction is made of the material herein, acknowledgment of the\r\nIllinois State Geological Survey is requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n—Silently corrected a few typos.\r\n\r\n—Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook\r\n  is public-domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n—In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by\r\n  _underscores_.",
