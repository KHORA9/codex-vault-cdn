APPLETON AND COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of this book is to give a condensed and, I trust, readable\r\naccount of the leading facts concerning the North American continent\r\nwhich, from the point of view of the geographer, seem most interesting\r\nand instructive. The area of the continent is so vast and the diversity\r\namong its various parts so great, however, that the completeness of\r\ntreatment which characterizes the preceding volumes in the series to\r\nwhich it belongs could not be attempted. To obviate in a measure this\r\nconfessed shortcoming, there has been appended to each chapter a list of\r\nbooks which will enable the reader to continue the studies outlined in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nA complete review of the geography of a continent should, as it seems to\r\nme, be divided into two parts: first, a discussion of the natural\r\nconditions, or physical geography, and, second, man's dependence on and\r\nuse of the natural resources, or economic geography. Each of these two\r\nleading phases of the subject was embraced in the preliminary outline of\r\nthe present volume, but owing to a desire to make each chapter as\r\ncomplete as practicable, and also on account of limitations as to space,\r\nthe treatment of the economic phases of geography has been necessarily\r\nbrief. But little more can be claimed for the book as finished than that\r\nit is an attempt to describe some of the more prominent and attractive\r\naspects of the natural conditions pertaining to North America.\r\n\r\nWhile writing this book I have become more and more impressed with the\r\nincompleteness and inadequacy of the printed records relating to the\r\ngeography of the continent of which it treats. Extensive tracts,\r\nparticularly in the far North, have not been traversed by observant men,\r\nvast areas throughout the continent have not been surveyed and mapped,\r\nand even in the somewhat thickly inhabited portions of the more\r\nenlightened countries there are large districts in reference to the\r\ngeography of which there is but little critical information available.\r\nUnder these conditions it seemed best to select typical examples of\r\nvarious geographical features from the better known portions of the\r\ncontinent to represent the conditions throughout the less thoroughly\r\nexplored domain in which they are situated, and at the same time serve\r\nto illustrate the highly creditable advances made by American\r\ngeographers in definitely formulating the principles of physiography.\r\nThe book may, in a measure, be considered as an attempt to present in\r\npopular form a report of progress concerning the study of the\r\ngeographical development of North America at the beginning of the\r\ntwentieth century.\r\n\r\n                                                       I.

The boundary of our field of study is defined with considerable\r\naccuracy by a line drawn on the bottom of the sea adjacent to the\r\npresent coast-line of the continent so as to pass through all points\r\nwhere the soundings show a depth of 100 fathoms of water. This\r\n100-fathom contour in the topography of the sea-floor chances to\r\ncoincide in a general way with the outline of the submerged border of\r\nthe continent; landward from it the bottom rises with a gentle slope,\r\nwhile seaward the descent is usually steep down to a depth of 2,000 or\r\nmore fathoms.\r\n\r\nA gently sloping shelf-like border surrounds the deep central basin of\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico (Fig. 3). To the west and north of Yucatan and west\r\nof Florida the shelf is from 140 to 160 miles broad, with a surface\r\nslope towards the centre of the Gulf of less than 6 feet to a mile--a\r\nslope so gentle that were the surface of the shelf exposed to view, no\r\neye could distinguish it from a perfect plain. The deepest sounding yet\r\nobtained in the central part of the Gulf, approximately midway between\r\nYucatan and Florida, shows a depth of 2,119 fathoms. The remarkable fact\r\nis that the slope from the 100-fathom line to the bottom of the central\r\nbasin of the Gulf is precipitous. In two places on the border of\r\nthe Yucatan bank a descent of about 8,500 feet occurs within a\r\nhorizontal distance of 15 or 20 miles.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of the southern extremity of Florida, and again on the\r\neastern shore of Yucatan, the continental shelf is only about 5 miles\r\nbroad; these are the nearest approaches of the present land to the\r\nactual border of the continent to be found on the Atlantic coast. The\r\nexplanation of these exceptional conditions is that both Florida and\r\nYucatan are portions of the continental shelf which have been raised so\r\nas to form low emerged plains.\r\n\r\nFrom Cape Hatteras northward to the extremity of the Newfoundland Banks\r\nthe shelf increases gradually in breadth from about 15 miles in the\r\nregion of the Carolinas to over 100 miles off the coast of Maine. The\r\nouter border of the shelf is an irregular curving line. Opposite the\r\ncoast of Massachusetts and Maine an extension of the Atlantic basin\r\nreaches within 15 or 20 miles of the present margin of the land. The\r\nmanner in which the low plain fringing the eastern border of the United\r\nStates passes beneath the waters of the Atlantic and becomes a\r\ncontinental shelf is illustrated by Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Ideal profile through a continental shelf.]\r\n\r\nSoutheast of Newfoundland the continental shelf has an irregular\r\nsurface, marked by shoals and depressions, and furnishes the most\r\nvaluable fishing-banks in the world. The 100-fathom curve is there over\r\n500 miles from the coast. This is the broadest portion of the\r\ncontinental shelf now known on the Atlantic border of the continent.\r\nNorthward of Newfoundland the Atlantic basin extends far into Davis\r\nStrait and Baffin Bay, and then its border swings outward about\r\nGreenland, but its true margin is there but imperfectly known.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the arctic coast of North America, as is suggested in\r\npart by the soundings made by Nansen, the submerged margin of the\r\ncontinent is probably broad and presents a steep escarpment to the\r\narctic basin, but the outline of the true continent, as in the case of\r\nthe present land extension in that direction, is unknown.\r\n\r\nSoundings to the north of Cape Lisburne, on the northwest coast of\r\nAlaska, show that the 100-fathom curve is there over 200 miles from\r\nland. The exceptionally shallow sea covering this portion of the shelf\r\ncontinues westward to the coast of Asia, and southward through Bering\r\nStrait, so as to embrace the eastern portion of Bering Sea. The\r\ncontinental mass of North America is thus directly connected with the\r\ncontinental mass of Asia. A rise of the bottom of less than 200 feet in\r\nBering Strait would bring about a land connection between the Old and\r\nthe New World. This, as will appear later, is a most significant fact to\r\nstudents of geography and geology.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific coast of North America the continental shelf is\r\nthroughout much narrower than its average breadth on the Atlantic side\r\nof the continent, and is also more deeply submerged on its seaward\r\nborder. The broad platform beneath the northern and eastern portions of\r\nBering Sea--from which rise the low islands, St. Lawrence, St. Matthew,\r\nNunivak, and the Pribilof group, now separated by water from 25 to 35\r\nfathoms deep--extends to the south of the more easterly of the Aleutian\r\nIslands, and is prolonged eastward along the south border of Alaska,\r\nwhere the 100-fathom curve is from 10 to 20 miles from the coast-line,\r\nand approaches still nearer the land in the neighbourhood of the islands\r\nof southeastern Alaska and British Columbia. The shelf is narrow but\r\nwell defined along the coasts of Washington and Oregon. Adjacent to\r\nCalifornia, Mexico, and Central America, its outer margin is barely 10\r\nmiles from land. Throughout the entire distance from the Aleutian\r\nIslands to Panama the outer border of the shelf is in general well\r\ndefined, and its seaward escarpment descends abruptly to the floor of\r\nthe vast Pacific basin, where the sounding-line shows depths of\r\nfrom 2,000 to 3,000 fathoms.\r\n\r\nCould the waters of the sea be removed and North America viewed from a\r\ndistance, in the manner we are enabled to examine the surface features\r\nof the moon through a powerful telescope, an observer would behold a\r\ngreat plateau, having the present well-known triangular shape of the\r\ncontinent, rising boldly between the Atlantic and the Pacific basins.\r\nThe surface of the plateau would be rough, in comparison with the\r\ngenerally smooth contours of the adjacent troughs, but even the highest\r\nmountains would be less in elevation above its general surface than the\r\ncrests of its bordering escarpments above the adjacent depressions. The\r\nmountain-peaks when illuminated by the sun would appear as points of\r\nlight with long, tapering morning and evening shadows, and the east and\r\nwest plateau-borders would be strongly drawn bands of light or shadow,\r\naccording to the time of day, 6,000 or 8,000 miles in length. The\r\nBermuda, Hawaiian, and other islands now rising above the surface of the\r\ndeep sea would stand on its desiccated floor as isolated, gigantic\r\nmountains--\"Bermuda mountain\" with an elevation of 15,000 feet, and the\r\nHawaiian group of peaks with a culminating point of light 30,000 feet\r\nabove the surrounding plain. The bordering slopes of the \"North American\r\nplateau\" and its slightly bevelled margin forming the present\r\ncontinental shelf would be lacking in details, and appear as a vast,\r\nsmooth, curving belt of light or shadow, in striking contrast to the\r\nroughened surface now above water.\r\n\r\nThe North American continent is not exceptional in being partially\r\nsubmerged at the present time. Similar conditions occur about the\r\nmargins of other continents which, as is well known, are fringed with\r\nbroad submarine terraces built in part of their own _debris_. In fact,\r\nevery large land mass on the earth under existing climatic conditions\r\nand present distribution of life, if it remained moderately stable for a\r\nsufficient length of time, would have a submarine shelf built about its\r\nborders.\r\n\r\n_Of what is the Continental Shelf Composed?_--The rocks forming the\r\npresent land surface of North America extend seaward from the existing\r\nshores and constitute the basal portions of the continental shelf, thus\r\nsuggesting that the submerged platform is due, in part at least, to\r\nshore erosion--the waves having eaten into the land so as to make a\r\nterrace. That this is not the true explanation, however, may be shown in\r\nseveral ways.\r\n\r\nThe superficial covering which gives the continental shelf its smooth\r\ncontours is composed largely of sediments such as rivers bring from the\r\nland. This material is coarsest and in greatest abundance near shore and\r\ndecreases both in the size of the particles composing it and in\r\nabundance towards the seaward borders of the shelf. The wash from the\r\nland is mostly deposited within a few miles of the coast-line and, as\r\nhas been shown by dredging, is seldom carried, even under the most\r\nfavourable conditions, more than about 100 miles seaward. Supplementing\r\nthe fragmental material derived from the land, and increasing in\r\nthickness towards the seaward margin of the continental\r\nshelf--coincident with the increase in depth of the water--is a deposit\r\nof light-coloured calcareous mud or ooze, formed of the hard parts of\r\nanimals and plants which live in the waters of the sea. The organisms\r\nwhich supply this material are in the main microscopic and live\r\nespecially in the warmer seas in countless myriads. Their dead shells or\r\ncases fall to the sea-floor in a constant shower, much as the snow falls\r\nfrom the air, but continuously year after year and century after\r\ncentury. This descent of the hard parts of organisms, both calcareous\r\nand siliceous, from the waters of the sea has led to the accumulation of\r\na sheet of slimy sediment over almost the entire sea-bottom. How thick\r\nthis layer is we have no means of knowing, but it is probably many\r\nhundreds of feet.\r\n\r\nThe organic _debris_ falling on the continental shelf descends through\r\nonly a few hundred feet of water and is but little affected by its\r\nsolvent action. The great number of organisms, such as the Foraminifera\r\nwhich secrete calcareous tests or \"shells\" causes the slime on the\r\ncontinental shelves to be calcareous and in the condition to form\r\nlimestone if cemented or subjected to sufficient pressure. In the deep\r\nsea, where the hard parts of dead organisms fall through many thousands\r\nof feet of water, their more soluble portions are removed and the bottom\r\nis covered throughout vast areas with a pinkish clay composed of the\r\nmore insoluble residue of the calcareous shells and the cases of\r\nsilica-secreting animals and plants.\r\n\r\nThe continental shelves are, in general, within the influences of ocean\r\ncurrents, and fine _debris_, as we seem justified in concluding, is\r\nremoved from their surfaces, carried beyond their margins, and deposited\r\non their seaward slopes. The shelves are thus built outward and are\r\nlargely constructional topographic forms. Their outer slopes, where best\r\ndefined, represent about the \"angle of repose\" in water of the fine\r\nmaterial of which they are composed. These slopes are in several regions\r\nso precipitous that they probably would not retain their present forms,\r\nbut descend in landslides, should the restraining pressure of the\r\nsea-water be removed.\r\n\r\nIn certain favoured regions, as about the southern extremity of Florida,\r\nover an extensive area in the West Indies, and on both sides of Central\r\nAmerica, the conditions favour the growth of reef-building coral-polyps,\r\nand portions of the continental shelf in that region are covered with an\r\nirregular layer of living coral and dead coral rock. The importance of\r\nthis resistant superficial layer on the minor features of the relief of\r\nthe submarine banks, etc., needs to be considered in studying the\r\nsecondary topographic features of many portions of the floor of shallow\r\ntropical seas.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the _debris_ from the land and the rain of the hard parts\r\nof organisms from the water covering the continental shelf there is in\r\nnorthern regions a third but less important source of material furnished\r\nby floating ice. About the northern shores of America sea ice forms in\r\nwinter, some of which is frozen fast to boulders and stones in shallow\r\nwater, and when this ice-foot, as it is termed, is adjacent to steep\r\ncliffs, rock _debris_ falls upon it. When the ice becomes broken\r\ninto cakes in the spring-time or during storms, it floats away, under\r\nthe influence of the winds and currents, and as it melts drops its\r\nfreight on the floor of the sea. This shore ice seldom travels far, and\r\nis probably not an important factor in the building of continental\r\nshelves. Of greater interest are the bergs derived from glaciers,\r\nespecially in Greenland, many of which contain hundreds of thousands and\r\neven millions of cubic feet of ice and travel hundreds of miles before\r\nmelting. In some instances these bergs carry with them rock masses, mud,\r\netc., derived from the land over which their parent glaciers flowed, and\r\nas they melt, distribute this material over the sea-floor. The greater\r\nportion of this ice-carried freight derived from Greenland is dropped on\r\nthe continental shelf, and not infrequently reaches the latitude of\r\nHalifax, and even journeys farther south. This berg-carried _debris_ is\r\nmainly deposited on the continental shelf, for the reason that the cold\r\ncurrents which bring the bergs southward follow the coast in a general\r\nway, and are bordered on their seaward margins by warmer currents\r\nflowing northward. To the north of Nova Scotia the additions of material\r\nto the continental shelf through the agency of bergs is considerable in\r\nthe aggregate, and as the process has been in operation for thousands of\r\nyears, the banks or shoals in the sea off the Newfoundland coast are due\r\nin part to this cause.\r\n\r\nIce-carried _debris_ forms an important source of material for the\r\nbuilding of the continental shelf from New England northward and\r\nwestward about the shores of North America, including Greenland, to\r\nBering Sea, and to a less extent on the south coast of Alaska, where\r\nmany comparatively small bergs are set afloat by glaciers which reach\r\ntide-water. Supplementing the distribution of _debris_ over the\r\ncontinental shelf by shore ice and bergs, is the similar work carried on\r\nby the ice discharged into the sea by northern rivers, such as the St.\r\nLawrence, Mackenzie, and the Yukon.\r\n\r\nDuring the glacial epoch great ice-sheets like those now discharging\r\nbergs along the Greenland coast, but vastly larger, entered the\r\nAtlantic all the way from New York to the Arctic Ocean, and along the\r\nPacific coast from the Aleutian Islands to the State of Washington.\r\nDuring certain periods of this time of intense glaciation great\r\nadditions of ice-borne _debris_ must have been made to the continental\r\nshelf. The banks to the east of Newfoundland and other similar shoals as\r\nfar south as Nantucket are probably due in large part to the _debris_\r\ndeposited by the glaciers which formerly entered the sea in that region.\r\nIt is of interest in this connection to note that the glaciers, even at\r\nthe time of their greatest expansion, could not have extended beyond the\r\nseaward margin of the continental shelf, for the reason that on passing\r\nthat boundary and entering deep water they must have broken off and\r\ngiven origin to bergs.\r\n\r\n_Submerged River Channels._--One of the most interesting features in\r\nconnection with the continental shelf bordering North America is that\r\nits generally plane surface is trenched in several places by canyon-like\r\ndepressions similar to the narrow steep-sided valleys which streams\r\nsometimes cut in the surfaces of plateaus. This suggestion that the\r\nsurface of the continental shelf is crossed by stream-cut channels is\r\nsupported by the fact that several such depressions, leading seaward\r\nfrom the present mouths of large rivers, have been discovered by the\r\nsounding-line. The best known example occurs off the mouth of the Hudson\r\nand has been traced from New York Bay about 120 miles seaward to the\r\nedge of the continental shelf. It is deepest and best defined on the\r\nouter portion of the submerged plateau, where for a distance of 23\r\nmiles, beginning 97 miles from Sandy Hook, it has an average width of 3\r\nmiles and a maximum depth of about 2,500 feet below the surface of the\r\nbordering submarine plain, which has 20 fathoms of water over it. This\r\ncanyon opens out in the seaward face of the plateau and forms a deep\r\nnotch in the generally uniform crest-line of that escarpment. Farther\r\n\"up-stream,\" so to speak, the channel narrows to a mile and a quarter,\r\nwith some irregularities in depth, and near Sandy Hook it is not\r\napparent, owing to the amount of _debris_, largely sand, swept into\r\nit by shore currents. This evidence, strengthened by the fact that the\r\ntrue rock-cut valley of the Hudson as far as Troy is filled with clay\r\nand sand to a considerable but unknown depth, is abundant proof that the\r\nland was formerly higher than at present by at least 3,000 feet, and\r\nthat the now submerged continental shelf off Long Island was then a\r\nplain above water, across which the ancient Hudson was extended. The\r\nriver flowed across this plain for a sufficient length of time to\r\nexcavate a canyon over 2,500 feet deep and 3 miles wide from crest to\r\ncrest of its walls in its seaward portion. This submerged channel has\r\nthe characteristics of a young, stream-cut valley and suggests that the\r\nplain across which it flowed to the eastward of Long Island was a\r\nsubmerged continental shelf previous to being upraised so as to be\r\ntrenched by the Hudson.\r\n\r\nThe evidence as to changes in the elevation of the Atlantic coast\r\nfurnished by the submerged valley of the Hudson does not stand alone.\r\nSimilar but less well-defined channels have been discovered by soundings\r\noff the mouths of the Delaware and the Susquehanna, while the most\r\nremarkable instance of all is furnished by the submerged valley of the\r\nSt. Lawrence, which has been traced through the Gulf of St. Lawrence and\r\nout to the brink of the submerged continental escarpment some 200 miles\r\neastward of Nova Scotia. The tide now rises and falls in the St.\r\nLawrence to within a few miles of Montreal; that is, the \"Greater St.\r\nLawrence\" has lost about 1,000 miles of its length owing to a downward\r\nmovement of the land.\r\n\r\nEvidence of the nature just considered is lacking, or, more correctly,\r\nsurveys and soundings which would perhaps reveal the presence of\r\nsubmerged river channels have not been made about the shores of the more\r\nnortherly portion of the continent, but instructive results in this\r\nconnection are to be expected when that region is thoroughly studied.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific coast several transverse channels in the continental\r\nshelf, similar to the submerged valleys of the Hudson, have been\r\ndiscovered by soundings, some of which are thought to be true\r\nstream-cut valleys; others, however, start from the coast where there\r\nare no rivers entering, and may be due to other and as yet unknown\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nAn exceptional feature in the geography of the Pacific coast to the\r\nsouth of the United States-Canadian boundary is furnished by the islands\r\noff the southern portion of California. These islands, of which Santa\r\nRosa, Santa Cruz, Santa Catalina, and San Clemente are the most\r\nimportant, rise from water that is 300 or more fathoms deep to a height\r\nof from a few hundred to about 2,000 feet above the present sea-level.\r\nThese islands are the summit portions of mountains similar to those\r\nwhich give a characteristic relief to southern California. One feature\r\nconcerning the islands referred to which is of interest in connection\r\nwith the study of the continental shelf is the presence on them of\r\nnumerous terraces. These occur on a series of level, step-like areas,\r\nwhich sweep about the slopes of the islands, in a general way parallel\r\nto the present shore-line, and are records of an upward movement of the\r\nland. The highest well-defined terrace on San Clemente occurs at an\r\nelevation of 1,320 feet, but there are less distinct beach-lines up to\r\n1,500 feet above the present sea-level. The evidence of movements of the\r\nland along the Pacific border of the continent might be multiplied, but\r\nenough has been stated to show that the western border of North America,\r\nlike its eastern portion, is subject to fluctuation in reference to the\r\nlevel of the sea. The line which marks the passage of the solid earth\r\nbeneath the waters of the sea is ever changing, owing to movements in\r\nthe earth's crust. It is ever changing, also, owing to the action of\r\nwaves and currents on the ocean's shores and other causes.\r\n\r\n_Life on the Continental Shelf._--No attempt need be made here to give\r\nan accurate description of the plants and animals which find a congenial\r\nhome on the continental shelf. One needs, however, to have in mind a\r\ngeneral idea of the wonderful abundance and variety of organic forms in\r\nthe shallow waters adjacent to the continent to fully appreciate the\r\nchanges in the relief of the ocean-floor, in which they play a\r\nleading part, and also the vast economic importance of these marine\r\nharvest-fields and pastures, as they may be termed.\r\n\r\nThe continental shelf fringing North America reaches from within 500\r\nmiles of the equator to probably a less distance of the north pole. Its\r\nlength following its broader curves is in the neighbourhood of 25,000\r\nmiles, and its average width is not far from 50 miles; its area is\r\ntherefore something like 1,000,000 square miles. On account of the vast\r\nextent of this submarine plain and its great range in latitude, the\r\nconditions influencing the lives of the plants and animals inhabiting\r\nits surface or living in the waters covering it vary from place to place\r\nbetween wide extremes. The waters resting on it have a mean annual\r\nsurface temperature of from 70 deg. to 80 deg. F. at the south, and about 32 deg. F.\r\nat the north. In places great rivers and the turbid waters from glaciers\r\nbring in sediments and form muddy deposits; at other localities the\r\ncurrents, as in the path of the Gulf Stream off the Carolina coast,\r\nsweep the bottom clear of all light _debris_; and again bare rocks of\r\nlimited extent are exposed. The depth of the water resting on the shelf\r\nvaries through all gradations down to 100 fathoms. At the south the\r\nhours of light and darkness are approximately equal each day, but at the\r\nnorth there are six months of sunlight and six months of darkness each\r\nyear. Still other variations, as of strength of currents, salinity,\r\netc., exert an influence in this realm and lead to great diversity in\r\nits living organisms. Throughout its entire extent, however, the\r\ncontinental shelf abounds in both plant and animal life.\r\n\r\nThe plant life of the sea, as has been shown in recent years by the use\r\nof the dredge and net, is most abundant at the surface and is\r\npractically absent at the bottom where the water is over 100 fathoms\r\ndeep. The animals of the sea, like those of the land, are dependent\r\nprimarily on plants for their food. By far the most abundant supply of\r\nfood plants in the sea is furnished by minute algae, which float free in\r\nits water. Below a depth of about 100 fathoms algae are absent because of\r\nlack of light, and all the deep-sea animals are believed to be\r\ncarnivorous. For these reasons the comparatively shallow waters\r\nadjacent to the land and mainly covering the continental shelf are the\r\nmost favourably circumstanced of any portion of the sea for the support\r\nof a teeming fauna.\r\n\r\nOn the continental shelf of North America, especially to the south of\r\nCape Cod on the Atlantic and south of the Aleutian Islands on the\r\nPacific coast, there is a warm temperature, light penetrates to the\r\nbottom except in the unfavourable and fortunately restricted areas of\r\nmuddy water, and motion of the waters produced by currents and the\r\npulsations of waves is present. These several favourable conditions\r\npermit of an exuberance of life such as is unknown to persons who\r\nconfine their attention to the study of land areas.\r\n\r\nWe may safely say, in the words of Alexander Agassiz, that the abundance\r\nof life in the many favoured localities of the ocean far surpasses that\r\nof the richest terrestrial faunal districts. The most thickly populated\r\ntropical jungle does not compare in wealth of animal or vegetable life\r\nwith certain portions of the continental shelf on the western border of\r\nthe Gulf Stream. In this connection we may also cite Humboldt, who\r\nbefore the marvellous revelations in reference to the life of the sea\r\nmade by recent dredging expeditions wrote: \"Upon surfaces less varied\r\nthan we find on continents, the sea contains in its bosom an exuberance\r\nof life of which no other portion of the globe could give us an idea.\"\r\n\r\nThe distribution of life in the sea is analogous to the distribution of\r\nlife on land, but in a reverse direction with reference to sea-level. A\r\ntraveller passing from the tropical plains of eastern Mexico and\r\nascending Orizaba, for example, crosses successive belts of vegetation,\r\neach with its indigenous animals, but merging one with another so as to\r\nmake a gradation in the luxuriance of the flora and the abundance of\r\nanimal life from the wonderfully rich plains adjacent to the Gulf coast\r\nto the snow-capped mountain top. In the sea, the tropical plains with\r\ntheir tangled vegetation and plentiful animal life are represented by\r\nthe still more uniform plain forming the submerged continental\r\nshelf with its strange forests of flowerless plants, the seaweeds. These\r\nsubmarine jungles shelter hosts of animal species, many of which swarm\r\nin countless myriads. This life embraces all grades of invertebrates,\r\nsuch as the microscopic protozoa, sponges, radiate animals like the\r\ncoral-polyps, starfishes, sea-urchins, etc., and crustaceans in vast\r\nvariety, and, among vertebrates, includes fishes, reptiles, and mammals.\r\nEven birds might be included in this category, since many of them are\r\nmore at home on the sea than on the land.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for food among this multitude is intense. As with many\r\nanimals on the land, adaptive coloration is here a means of escape from\r\nenemies, and many of the animals assume the brilliant hues of the\r\nsurrounding vegetation. The water is less transparent than air, and in\r\nthe deep sea it is always night. Counteracting to some extent this\r\ndiminution or absence of sunlight, many marine animals are luminous and\r\nshine with phosphorescent light of many different tints. This property\r\nis shared also by the animals of the sunny, shallow sea as well as by\r\nthose always living in the cold midnight of the great deep and in the\r\npolar oceans.\r\n\r\nThe luxuriant vegetation, both attached and floating, and varying from\r\ngiant kelp, scores of feet in length, to microscopic algae which an\r\namoeba might encompass, clothes the surface of the continental shelf\r\nexcept in unfavourable localities or is carried here and there by the\r\ncurrents moving over it, but has its lower limit at about the 100-fathom\r\nline. This inferior limit of marine vegetation is probably more\r\ndefinitely defined than the superior limit of land plants on snow-capped\r\nmountains. All attached seaweeds are confined to the shallow seas, but\r\nfloating kelp, like the well-known Gulf weed or sargasso, which collects\r\nin the eddies of the sea currents and forms more or less mythical\r\nfloating islands, is widely distributed, as are also many kinds of\r\nminute algae which thrive in the upper 100 fathoms of the open ocean in\r\nall latitudes. The primary source of food for the hungry millions of\r\nmarine animals, excepting the comparatively small quantity brought\r\nby rivers or blown from the land, is supplied by the marine algae, and\r\nmainly by the minute forms which float in the water.\r\n\r\nSo much space has just been given to the marvellous luxuriance of life\r\non the southern portion of the great shelf surrounding North America\r\nthat the reader may perhaps think the cold northern oceans are even more\r\nlifeless and desolate than their adjacent shores. This, however, is not\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nNorthward along the continental shelf, with decrease in the strength of\r\nthe sunlight, the plants and animals lose much of the brilliancy which\r\ncharacterizes many of the denizens of southern waters, and in general\r\nassume more subdued colours in harmony with the prevailing gray of their\r\nsurroundings. The great diversity of animal life to be found in shallow\r\ntropical seas decreases as one traces the continental shelf northward,\r\nbut even in the Arctic Ocean adjacent to the land invertebrate life\r\nliterally swarms, although the number of species, genera, etc., is\r\ncomparatively limited. Seaweeds are not absent from the Arctic Ocean,\r\nalthough its shores, owing to the destructive action of ice, usually\r\nseem exceedingly barren, and the lower or smaller forms of algae float in\r\nthe waters in abundance. Food sufficient for an extensive fauna is thus\r\nsupplied, and where food is plentiful animals are present also, no\r\nmatter what the mean annual temperature may be.\r\n\r\nThe life of the Arctic Ocean has been but inadequately studied, but\r\nenough is known concerning it to show that a promising field there\r\nawaits the naturalist. On the continental shelf off Point Barrow, the\r\nmost northern portion of the arctic shore of Alaska (latitude 71 deg. 23'),\r\n180 species of marine invertebrates have been collected. Of these, the\r\nmolluscs numbered 61 species; the crustaceans, 44 species; the worms, 20\r\nspecies; and the echinoderms (sea-urchins, starfish, etc.), 17 species.\r\n\r\nNearly all of the Arctic Ocean adjacent to the coast of America is as\r\nyet unexplored, and we have therefore no direct testimony as to its\r\nflora and fauna. We may reasonably assume, however, that the life is\r\nthere practically the same as in the waters of similar depth to\r\nthe north of Eurasia. Nordenskioeld, in his narrative of the voyage of\r\nthe Vega, speaks of decapods, worms, mussels, crustacea, and asteroids\r\nwhich crawled in myriads over the beds of clay and sand at the bottom of\r\nthe Kara Sea. A detailed account is given of one unusually successful\r\nhaul of the trawl when it brought up large asteroids, sponges, crinoids,\r\nholothuria, a gigantic spider, masses of worms, crustacea, etc. This was\r\nthe most abundant yield of the trawl-net at any one time during the\r\nvoyage of the Vega on the north coast of Asia, and that, too, from the\r\nsea off the northern extremity of the continent. The temperature of the\r\nwater at the surface was from zero to -1.4 deg. C. (32 deg. to 29.48 deg. F.), and\r\nat the bottom from -1.4 deg. to 1.6 deg. C. (29.48 deg. to 34.88 deg. F.). In this\r\nconnection the same distinguished naturalist remarks: \"It is singular\r\nthat a temperature under the freezing-point of pure water should be\r\nadvantageous for the development of an animal life so extremely rich as\r\nthat which is found here, and that this animal life should not suffer\r\nany harm from the complete darkness which during the greater portion of\r\nthe year prevails at the bottom of the ice-covered sea.\"\r\n\r\nTo persons who have never visited the far north the statements that\r\ntravellers in those regions give in reference to the abundance of life\r\nin the sea seems scarcely to be credited. The assertion, however, that\r\ncomparing equal areas in the most populous tropical sea and in portions\r\nof the Arctic Ocean, the amount of life, or the tons of living animal\r\nmatter per square mile in the two regions, would be in favour of the\r\nnorthern station is probably true. In addition to the direct evidence\r\nindicated above as to the prolific invertebrate life of the cold waters\r\nof the north, we have still more impressive testimony from the vast\r\nnumbers of birds and large-sized mammals which subsist on this\r\nabundance, or feed on fishes, which in turn obtain their subsistence\r\nfrom the invertebrate realm.\r\n\r\nEvery rocky island and headland at the north is a breeding-place for\r\nsea-birds. They are to be numbered by millions, yet their daily food is\r\ngathered from the surface of the sea. The seals live in large\r\nnumbers about all the arctic shore, and the walruses, each individual\r\nweighing about a ton, occur in herds; while whales and narwhals inhabit\r\nthe same waters. The presence of such numbers of large mammals is proof\r\nthat the life on which they subsist is abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE SUBMARINE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE CARIBBEAN REGION\r\n\r\nThe studies which have given to the world so much information concerning\r\nthe continental shelf surrounding the main body of North America have\r\nbeen continued, or, perhaps more properly, were initiated, in the West\r\nIndian waters. For this important work we are indebted mainly to the\r\nUnited States Coast and Geodetic Survey and the United States Fish\r\nCommission. The work of officers of the United States Navy in charge of\r\nCoast Survey and Fish Commission vessels, in making accurate\r\nmeasurements of depths, temperatures, strength and direction of\r\ncurrents, character of bottom, etc., has, in some instances, been\r\ncommemorated on maps of the sea-floor by such names as Brownson Deep,\r\nSigsbee Deep, Bartlett Deep, etc. The routine survey work referred to\r\nhas been supplemented and extended by the labours of Louis Agassiz, L.\r\nF. Pourtales, Alexander Agassiz, and others in studying the life in the\r\nsea, the origin and history of the material forming the sea-bottom, and\r\nthe nature of the shelves, banks, deeps, etc., which give diversity to\r\nits topography.\r\n\r\nThe continental shelf bordering Florida on the east is separated from a\r\nsimilar submarine embankment surrounding the Bahama Islands by a channel\r\n56 miles wide and from 200 to 500 fathoms deep (Fig. 3).\r\nThis channel when followed northward becomes shallower and broader, and\r\nopposite the Carolina coast is no longer discernible in the relief of\r\nthe broad continental shelf. The Gulf Stream flows northward through\r\nthis Florida channel, as it is termed, with a current of from 2 to 6\r\nmiles per hour. These conditions are such as to suggest that the channel\r\nreferred to has in part been excavated by the Gulf Stream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean region:\r\ntopography of sea-floor. The first contour line from the land indicates\r\na depth of 600 feet--the outer margin of the continental shelf. Contour\r\ninterval below the 600-foot curve, 3,000 feet. After R. T. Hill.]\r\n\r\nThe Great Bahama Bank, from which rise the low coral-built Andros\r\nIslands and a large number of crags and rocks, measures about 360\r\ngeographical miles from southeast to northwest, and has a width of\r\napproximately 200 geographical miles. Throughout its entire submerged\r\nportion the water is less than 100, and over much of the area less than\r\n10 fathoms deep. It is invaded and given an irregular shape, however, by\r\na \"tongue of the ocean\" which curves in from the northward, in which\r\nsoundings of from 700 to 1,000 fathoms have been obtained. To the north\r\nof the Great Bahama Bank, and separated from it by water nearly 2,000\r\nfathoms deep, is the Little Bahama Bank, measuring 50 by 150\r\ngeographical miles, from which rises the low islands known as Great\r\nBahama, Great Abaco, and a multitude of islets and crags, while beneath\r\nthe water, as is the case also on the greater submarine plateau to the\r\nsouth, there are numerous shoals. Southeast from the Great Bahama Bank,\r\nand in a general view to be classed with it, are several other shallow\r\nareas in the sea, of similar character, and with numerous islands and\r\nreefs rising from them. The southeastern terminus of this series of\r\nplateaus, the surfaces of which have been built up practically to the\r\nlevel of the surface of the sea, is the Navidad Bank, situated about 50\r\nmiles to the north of the eastern end of the island of Santo Domingo\r\n(Haiti) and forms the west border of Brownson Deep. The length of the\r\nseries of banks to the north of the Greater Antilles is about 800, and\r\nits average width 120 geographical miles.\r\n\r\nThe unevenness of the surface of the Bahama Banks (and the same is true\r\nalso of the southern portion of Florida, the Yucatan peninsula, and of\r\nnearly all of the submarine plateaus or banks in West India waters) is\r\nlargely due to the coral reefs and the coral rock formed on them. While\r\nthe outer portion of the continental shelf, in most instances, is formed\r\nof soft, unconsolidated calcareous mud or ooze, in the tropical seas,\r\nwhere the depth, clearness of the water, etc., are favourable,\r\nreef-building coral-polyps become attached and form massive corals. The\r\ngrowth of these corals is irregular, and the surface of the plateaus\r\nwhere they are attached becomes roughened. There is a delicate\r\nadjustment between the growth of reef-building corals and strength of\r\ncurrent, freedom of exposure to the waves, etc., and they flourish in\r\ncertain localities, as on the windward border of islands, and die at\r\nother localities. The growth of coral \"heads\" and reefs changes the\r\ndirection of currents, and the spaces of soft ooze and dead coral\r\nbetween the localities most favourable for coral growth are liable to be\r\nscoured out and the bottom lowered. When coral, together with the shells\r\nof molluscs and other organic refuse of the teeming life of tropical\r\nseas, reaches the surface of the water, fragments and even large masses\r\nare broken off by the force of the waves, ground into calcareous sand\r\nowing to the movements produced by the waves and currents, and much of\r\nit heaped on the borders of the reefs so as to raise them above the\r\nfair-weather level of the sea. Much of this material, when it becomes\r\ndry, is moved by the winds and built into dunes, thus still further\r\nincreasing the height of the land. Many of the islands in the Bahamas\r\nhave thus been formed, but the process has been modified in the greater\r\npart of that region by movements in the earth's crust which have\r\nproduced widely extended elevations and depressions. The larger islands\r\nin the Bahama group are coral platforms which have been moderately\r\nelevated, and bear on their surfaces extensive accumulations of\r\nwind-deposited sand. The Yucatan peninsula is also, to a great extent,\r\nan upraised coral platform. The surfaces of such exposed areas of easily\r\nsoluble calcareous rocks are roughened still more by the action of rain\r\nand percolating waters, and if subsequently submerged to a moderate\r\ndepth would give origin to \"banks\" with uneven, and possibly\r\nconspicuously roughened surfaces. Different stages in this varied\r\nhistory are illustrated throughout the West India region.\r\n\r\nAbout the Caribbean coast of Honduras and Nicaragua the continental\r\nshelf is broad and is termed the Mosquito Bank, in reference to its\r\nproximity to the widely known coast of that name. Off the northeast cape\r\nof Honduras this submerged shelf has a breadth of about 125 geographical\r\nmiles, and is succeeded to the eastward by the much smaller,\r\nisolated, submarine plateau known as the Rosalind Bank. Even on a small\r\nmap, like that forming Fig. 3, it is readily seen that in\r\ngeneral terms there is a series of banks and low islands extending from\r\nthe Mosquito Coast to Jamaica, Santo Domingo, Porto Rico, and the\r\nCaribbees. The distance measured along the curved line connecting the\r\nseveral areas of shallow water is about 1,700 geographical miles. Should\r\nthis region be upraised 600 feet, the new lands that would appear would\r\nstill, in several instances, be separated by deep water, thus showing\r\nthat although in a generalized view it is convenient to consider the\r\nbanks and shelves referred to as parts of a single great group, there\r\nare several centres from which they have grown.\r\n\r\nA third great group of banks and shoals occurs about the borders of\r\nCuba, especially along its southern margin. Associated with this\r\nsubmerged plain of calcareous mud, roughened by countless coral crags,\r\nis a narrow east-and-west ridge in the Caribbean Sea, known in part as\r\nthe Misteriosa Bank, which rises precipitously on its southeast border\r\nfrom a depth of over 3,400 fathoms, and is indicated at the surface by\r\nthe Cayman Islands.\r\n\r\nThe Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico region has great depressions or \"deeps\"\r\nas well as broad banks or shoals. The submarine topography is, in fact,\r\non a more Titanic scale than in any other known region. Brownson Deep,\r\nsome 50 miles north of Porto Rico, has a depth of 4,561 fathoms (27,366\r\nfeet), and the bordering slopes of the depression in certain places, and\r\nfor long distances, have an inclination of 35 degrees. Between 15 and 30\r\nmiles south of Porto Rico the bottom of the Caribbean Sea is 1,500\r\nfathoms below its surface, and rapidly descends to over 2,400 fathoms.\r\nBartlett Deep, a long, narrow depression in the sea-floor, intervening\r\nin its eastern portion between Cuba and Jamaica, has a depth of 3,428\r\nfathoms (20,568 feet) measured from the surface of the sea. Sigsbee\r\nDeep, in the central portion of the Gulf of Mexico, is a third basin of\r\nsimilar nature, remarkable for the great extent of its nearly\r\nlevel floor, which is from 2,035 to 2,071 fathoms below sea-level. (On\r\nFig. 3 only the general depths of these great depressions are\r\nindicated.) Coupled with the profound depth of the sea in the West\r\nIndian region are the rugged mountains of the Great Antilles and the\r\nvolcanic cones of the Caribbees. Some of the elevations of the land\r\nreferred to are, in feet, as follows: Porto Rico, 3,609; Jamaica, 7,360;\r\nCuba, 8,600; and Santo Domingo, 10,300. The extreme range in the relief\r\nof the surface of the solid earth (lithosphere) between the bottom of\r\nBrownson Deep and the summit of Santo Domingo is 37,666 feet--the\r\nhorizontal distance between the two is about 270 geographical miles. No\r\nmountain on the earth has such an elevation above sea-level. The islands\r\nof the West Indies are thus shown to be the summits of stupendous\r\nmountains, the greater portions of which are submerged. The low-lying\r\nislands, and even the banks which can be discovered only with the aid of\r\nthe sounding-line, are in reality the tops of wonderfully steep\r\nmountains or plateaus some 20,000 feet in height.\r\n\r\nIt is a significant fact that the profiles of the partially or wholly\r\nsubmerged mountains of the West Indies are, as a rule, steeper than the\r\nslopes of the mountains on the land with which they may reasonably be\r\ncompared. This is due in part, perhaps, to the greater density of the\r\nmedium in which they stand, the sea-water affording a greater degree of\r\nsupport than the air, but the main reason is that beneath a few hundred\r\nfeet of water there is no erosion except the exceedingly slow removal of\r\nmatter in solution. Could the waters of the sea be withdrawn so as to\r\nreveal the Caribbean Mountains in all of their stupendous grandeur, the\r\nvast, smooth, sweeping surfaces extending from the horizontal lines\r\ndrawn about the higher summits by the waves and by the deposition of\r\nsediment and coral growths, down to their bases would be unmarked by\r\nchannels and ridges of the character that give details to the type of\r\nmountains with which we are most familiar.\r\n\r\nAn instructive generalization concerning the relief of the West India\r\nregion, suggested by Alexander Agassiz and sustained by the later\r\nstudies of R. T. Hill, is that we there find topographic forms produced\r\nby movements in the earth's crust which have not been modified by\r\nerosion. The great elevations rising from the floors of the \"deeps\" are\r\nupraised blocks of the earth's crust which have not been beaten by rain,\r\nshattered by frost, or trenched by rills, creeks, or rivers. They\r\nillustrate the character of the rough blocks of rock from which many of\r\nthe mountain forms of the land have been sculptured.\r\n\r\nThis sweeping view, which it seems safe to accept as a generalized\r\noutline of the history of the topography of the region in question,\r\nneeds to be qualified, as there are known to have been extensive up and\r\ndown movements throughout large areas in that portion of the earth's\r\nsurface. The mountains on Jamaica are scored by horizontal lines marking\r\nformer sea-levels up to a height of 2,000 feet, and similar and still\r\nhigher records are plainly visible on several of the larger West India\r\nislands. This evidence shows that the present land over a wide extent of\r\nthe Caribbean region was formerly deeply submerged. More than this, the\r\nrocks forming the higher portions of the Greater Antilles are largely\r\ncomposed of more or less consolidated ooze, such as is now found on the\r\nsea-floor in deep water. This line of evidence shows that what in late\r\ngeological time was the sea-floor has been raised between 20,000 and\r\n30,000 feet. It is thus known that both upward and downward movements of\r\ngreat vertical and great horizontal extent have occurred in the\r\nCaribbean region. Whatever minor changes the topography of the now\r\nsubmerged sea-floor may have suffered owing to emergence, the general\r\nrelief, as suggested above, seems to have resulted from movements in the\r\nearth's crust, and that these movements, in certain instances at least,\r\nproduced faults--that is, breaks or fissures--along which the rocks were\r\nupraised on one side or depressed on the other, so as to form great\r\ncliffs. The precipitous submarine slope forming the northwest border of\r\nBartlett Deep may reasonably be interpreted as a great fault scarp. A\r\nportion of this escarpment rises above the sea and forms the remarkably\r\nstraight and exceedingly rugged south coast of Cuba in the region\r\nof Santiago. In the main the remarkable submarine topography of the West\r\nIndia region presents us with an example of what would have been the\r\nleading features of several portions of the earth's surface which are\r\nnow land, as, for example, the Great Basin region of Utah, Nevada, etc.,\r\nhad deformation gone on without erosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MOVEMENTS OF THE OCEAN WATERS\r\n\r\nTo the student of the geography of a continent the climatic and other\r\ninfluences of the great ocean currents, as well as the more tangible\r\nresults produced by the waves which break on the borders of the land,\r\ndemand extended and painstaking investigation. The most that we can hope\r\nto do at present in this connection is to state briefly some of the more\r\nimportant influences that the movements of the ocean waters have on the\r\nclimate of North America and on the topography of its shores.\r\n\r\n_Currents._--The surface waters of both the north Atlantic and the north\r\nPacific, as is the case with all broad water bodies, have a drift and in\r\nplaces flow in well-defined currents, mainly on account of the friction\r\nof the wind on the surface of the sea, aided by variations in the\r\ndensity of the water due to differences in temperature and salinity. In\r\neach ocean there is a great swirl or eddy, for the reason that the\r\nsurface drift and the flow of the deeper currents carry the waters about\r\nin a rudely circular path, parallel in a general way with the boundaries\r\nof the respective basins. The direction of this motion, to one situated\r\nin the central part of either basin, is from left to right, or with the\r\nmovements of the hands of a watch. In the southern portion of each basin\r\nthere is a westward-flowing equatorial current, which in each instance\r\nis deflected northward on approaching the bordering land, and as it\r\ncontinues is still more deflected owing to the influence of the earth's\r\nrotation, and acquires a northeast trend; on reaching the eastern side\r\nof the oceanic basins, the currents are again deflected, a portion of\r\nthe one in the Atlantic and all of the one in the Pacific being\r\nturned southward so as to complete the circuit.\r\n\r\nIn the southern portion of the north Atlantic the surface drift is\r\nwestward at a rate of four or five miles a day. The waters, forced along\r\nprincipally by the trade-winds, flow through the numerous passes between\r\nthe Lesser Antilles and enter the Caribbean Sea, and from thence are\r\ncarried through the Yucatan channel into the Gulf of Mexico. The waters\r\nare piled up, as it were, in that great landlocked basin, at the same\r\ntime becoming warmer, and receive additions of fresh water from rain and\r\ninflowing streams. Each of these causes tends to decrease the density of\r\nthe water, while evaporation has a counterbalancing influence. The\r\nescape for the waters, both salt and fresh, which enter the Gulf, is by\r\nevaporation and by flowing through the only notch in the rim of the Gulf\r\nbasin which is not in the path of the equatorial current, namely, the\r\nstrait separating Florida from Cuba and the Bahama Islands. These\r\noutflowing waters form the justly celebrated Gulf Stream.\r\n\r\nBetween Florida and the shoal waters on the Bahama Banks the Gulf Stream\r\nis about 50 miles wide, approximately 350 fathoms deep, and flows\r\nnorthward at the rate of from four to five miles an hour. Its\r\ntemperature is about 80 deg. F. It is estimated that this great river in the\r\nocean carries 90,000,000,000 tons of water per hour past a given\r\ncross-section. Its course is northward along the immediate border of the\r\ncontinental shelf until it arrives opposite the Carolina coast, and\r\nthence northeastward, thus giving it a constantly increasing distance\r\nfrom the land. To the north of the Bahamas it receives as a tributary\r\nthe portion of the equatorial current, perhaps even greater in volume\r\nthan the true Gulf Stream, which is deflected northward by the West\r\nIndia Islands and their associated banks. Continuing its course, it is\r\ndeflected still more towards the northeast owing to the influence of the\r\nearth's rotation, at the same time expanding and losing velocity so as\r\nto become a surface drift rather than a well-defined current. Under the\r\ninfluence of the prevailing westerly winds of the north Atlantic, the\r\nwaters delivered by the Gulf Stream pass the vicinity of the\r\nBritish Islands and in part enter the Greenland Sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.--Orographical features.]\r\n\r\nThe transfer of the vast amount of warm water carried by the Gulf Stream\r\nfar to the north is counterbalanced in part by a southward-flowing cold\r\ncurrent which emerges from Davis Strait, and being joined by another\r\ncold current from the eastward of Greenland, continues southward under\r\nthe name of the Labrador current, past Newfoundland and Nova Scotia to\r\nthe Massachusetts coast, and is thought to exert an influence on the\r\ntemperature of the sea even as far south as Cape Hatteras. While the\r\nGulf Stream in the northern portion of its course curves eastward and\r\ndeparts from the American coast, the southward-flowing Labrador current\r\nis turned westward and follows close along the border of the land, and\r\nmainly over the continental shelf.\r\n\r\nThe chief effect of the cold current from the north in proximity to the\r\ncoast of the continent is to bring to the adjacent land a lower mean\r\nannual temperature and especially colder and more stormy winters than it\r\nwould otherwise experience. This tendency is augmented by the icebergs\r\ncarried southward with the Labrador current. In a similar way, the\r\nnorthward-flowing warm current gives Florida and the Carolinas a\r\nsubtropical climate, admits of the growth of reef-building corals about\r\nthe Bermuda Islands, and carries so much warmth to northwestern Europe\r\nthat its climate is milder and more humid than one would expect from its\r\ngeographical position.\r\n\r\nThe currents of the north Pacific are analogous to those of the north\r\nAtlantic, but simpler, as there is nothing similar to the true Gulf\r\nStream, and as communication with the Arctic Ocean is practically\r\nclosed, there is no cold current flowing southward from that ocean; but\r\nthe conditions, so far as they influence the climate of North America,\r\nare reversed. A warm current flowing northward off the coast of Japan,\r\nand hence known as the Japan current, crosses the Pacific, and on\r\napproaching the coast of Alaska and British Columbia is deflected\r\nsouthward. The climate of the northwest coast is thus ameliorated, the\r\nprevailing westerly winds are warm and humid, and the mean annual\r\nprecipitation from western Alaska to Oregon is in the neighbourhood of\r\n100 inches. Under the influence of a mild equitable temperature and\r\nabundant moisture, the land bordering the Pacific from southern Alaska\r\nto northern California is clothed with the most magnificent forests that\r\nthe continent affords. The marked contrasts in climate, vegetation, and\r\nthe conditions that influence civilization between the two sides of the\r\nNorth American continent, produced by the cold Labrador current on the\r\neast and the warm Japan current on the west, is shown in a marked way by\r\nthe sweep of the lines of equal mean annual temperature (isotherms)\r\nrepresented on the map forming Plate II, and again by the\r\ndistribution of forests, as will be described later. It is instructive\r\nto note that the climate of Sitka, in north latitude 57 deg., is far more\r\ntemperate and equable than that of New York city, latitude 40 deg. 45',\r\nalthough the cool summers on the northwest coast make the mean annual\r\ntemperature somewhat lower than on the coast of New York, or even of New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the opposite conditions in reference to ocean currents\r\nexperienced by the eastern and western borders of the continent are even\r\nmore marked in the life of the adjacent waters than in the vegetation\r\nand fauna of the land itself. The plant and invertebrate life of the\r\nshoal waters of the Pacific coast, consisting largely of southern\r\nspecies, is exceedingly rich and varied, even to the inlets of the\r\nAlaska coast, where glaciers come down to the sea; while on the Atlantic\r\nborder, northern species occur on the New England coast, and even\r\nfarther south. The contrasts in temperature between the waters of the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific which cover the submerged border of the continent\r\nare well shown by the distribution of the cod, the most valuable of all\r\nfishes to man, which, as is well known, belongs to the northern fauna\r\nand ranges from the north Atlantic about the arctic coast of both the\r\nOld and the New Hemispheres, to the north Pacific. On the east coast of\r\nAmerica this circumpolar fish, of which several species are known, is\r\nfound occasionally as far south as Cape Hatteras, but the most southern\r\n\"bank\" on which it is extensively taken is off Cape Cod, in\r\nlatitude 42 deg.; on the west coast it travels perhaps as far south as the\r\nmouth of the Columbia, but the most southern locality where it occurs in\r\ncommercial quantities is off the Shumagin Islands, in latitude 55 deg.. The\r\nlife of the continental shelf, as well as of the adjacent land, thus\r\nbears testimony to the vast importance to North America of the great\r\nocean currents washing its shores.\r\n\r\n_Tides._--The waters of the ocean are subject to wave-like undulations,\r\ncaused by the attraction of the moon and sun, termed the tides. Every\r\nday, at the average interval of twelve hours and fifty-one minutes, the\r\n\"tide rises,\" and with equal regularity intermediate between these\r\nperiods it \"falls.\" This rise and fall of the waters along the coast,\r\naccompanied frequently by strong currents, are produced directly by the\r\narrival in the shoal water of a pulsation of the ocean, which becomes a\r\ntrue onward-moving gravity wave as it nears the land. In the open sea\r\nthe amplitude of the tidal undulations is but two or three feet, and\r\ntheir rate of travel in general 700 to 800 miles per hour. On reaching\r\nshoal water, however, the onward movement is decreased by friction on\r\nthe bottom, the waves become higher, and when they meet an\r\noutward-flowing bottom current, their bases are still more retarded and\r\nthe slope of their fronts increases until the water falls forward and\r\nbreaks into foam. On the Atlantic coast, each tidal wave reaches the\r\nland broadside on, as it were (Fig. 4), and at the outer capes high\r\nwater occurs at practically the same time from Florida to New England,\r\nbut its farther landward progression is greatly modified by the shape of\r\nthe coast and the depth of water in the estuaries and other\r\nindentations. When the wave as it rushes landward enters a broad water\r\nbody through a narrow entrance, as the Gulf of Mexico, for example, it\r\nspreads, and as the impulse is transmitted to larger and larger volumes\r\nof water, it decreases in height. (In a critical study the tides\r\noriginating in the Gulf itself should be considered.) At Galveston,\r\nTexas, the mean range between high and low tide is less than one foot.\r\nWhen, however, an estuary with a broad mouth receives a tidal wave from\r\nthe ocean, the impulse is more and more concentrated and the wave\r\nrises higher. At the head of the Bay of Fundy the difference between\r\nhigh and low water is from 50 to 60 feet. For the reason just stated,\r\nthe tidal wave is generally higher in the Atlantic coast estuaries than\r\non the ocean capes, and under favourable conditions may be transmitted\r\nfor long distances up the rivers emptying into such estuaries, and may\r\nbe felt where the mean elevation of the stream is several feet above the\r\nmean level of the sea on the neighbouring open coast. Tidal waves pass\r\nup the Hudson to Troy, a distance of 150 miles from the Narrows,\r\nwhere the mean range is 2.3 feet. In St. John River, New Brunswick, the\r\ntidal impulse is felt at Frederickton, 70 miles from the Bay of Fundy,\r\nand at an elevation of 14 feet above its surface. In the St. Lawrence\r\nestuary and river the tidal waves ascend 283 miles to Three Rivers, a\r\nfew miles below Montreal, where the mean elevation is about 11 feet and\r\nthe mean range of the tide 0.9 foot. In the Columbia the range of the\r\ntide is about 6 inches at a distance of 140 miles from the ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Co-tidal lines. A diagrammatic representation of\r\nthe advance of tidal waves in the Atlantic and Pacific. Figures refer to\r\nnoon and midnight. After R. S. Tarr.]\r\n\r\nIn the north Pacific (Fig. 4) the tidal waves come from the south and\r\nexpand much the same as the corresponding waves do in the north\r\nAtlantic, but instead of striking the coast broadside on, sweep along\r\nthe shore from south to north.\r\n\r\nThere are two localities on the coast of North America, one at the head\r\nof the Bay of Fundy and the other at the head of Cook's Inlet, Alaska,\r\nwhere the tides present especially interesting features. In each of\r\nthese inlets the incoming tidal wave meets an outward-flowing current\r\nwhich tends to hold it back. The incoming waters are thus piled up until\r\nsufficient head is established to cause them to advance as a\r\nsteep-fronted wave termed a _bore_, which curls over and breaks in a\r\nlong line of foam as it rushes along. At the head of the Bay of Fundy\r\nthe bore travels at the rate of 6 or 7 miles an hour, and has a height\r\nof from 4 to 6 feet. The great disturbance produced by the strong\r\ncurrent and breaking waves causes the mud of the bottom to be disturbed\r\nand the waters to be charged with sediment. Much of this mud is\r\ndeposited during the interval of quiet water at high tide, and as the\r\noutflow is not so impetuous as the inflow, broad mud-flats are formed.\r\nAt certain localities about the Bay of Fundy artificial dikes have been\r\nmade, which admit the mud-charged waters at high tide, and retain them\r\nuntil much of their freight is deposited. In this manner, large areas of\r\nrich lands have been secured.\r\n\r\nThe geographical influences of the tides and of the currents produced by\r\nthem are of interest in many ways. To navigators they are of special\r\nimportance. Even in this age of steam, the arrival and departure\r\nof vessels from harbours is regulated so as to take advantage of the\r\nincoming or outgoing tidal currents. Many harbours can be entered by\r\ndeep-draft vessels only at high water, for the reason in general that\r\nsand-bars are frequently formed at the mouths of tidal estuaries. One of\r\nthe most marked illustrations of the influence of the rise and fall of\r\nthe tide on navigation occurs at St. John, New Brunswick, where the tide\r\nflows in and out of St. John River so as to form a cascade each way,\r\ndependent on the direction of the current. At low water the level of the\r\nriver is from 11 to 15 feet above the Bay of Fundy, and at high water\r\nthe level of the bay is from 8 to 12 feet above that of the river when\r\nnot affected by the tide. There are four periods of from ten to fifteen\r\nminutes each during each twenty-four hours when vessels can pass in and\r\nout of the river's mouth.\r\n\r\nIn the Arctic Ocean the tides are small. At Point Barrow, the most\r\nnorthern locality on the coast of Alaska, the difference between high\r\nand low water is but 6 or 7 inches. The tide comes from the southward\r\nand westward, and there is a prevailing current setting to the eastward.\r\nAt Herschel Island, near where the east boundary of Alaska reaches the\r\nArctic Ocean, the mean range of the tide is but 1.8 foot. At Cape\r\nSheridan, the northeast point of Grinnell Land, north latitude 82 deg. 25',\r\nthere is a range of 2.6 feet during two periods each month when the\r\ntides are highest, and but 1.2 foot at the lowest or neap tide periods.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the weakness of the tides and tidal currents along the\r\narctic coast, there is an absence or great diminution of the influence\r\nof wave and currents, owing to the prevalence of ice on the sea. Shore\r\nerosion is there at a minimum in spite of the abrasion produced by the\r\nice-packs when forced landward by the wind.\r\n\r\n_Islands._--In the classification of islands used by A. R. Wallace in\r\nhis Island Life two primary divisions are recognised, namely,\r\ncontinental and oceanic islands.\r\n\r\nContinental islands are land masses which have been separated from\r\ncontinents and are rarely far removed from their borders, and,\r\nbesides, are composed of rocks similar to those of the neighbouring\r\nmainland and inhabited by terrestrial animals which are related to the\r\nfauna of the larger land area. Ancient and modern continental islands\r\nhave also been recognised, their age being indicated by the degree of\r\nsimilarity between their faunas and the fauna of the continent with\r\nwhich they were formerly connected. Those of ancient origin are commonly\r\nsurrounded by deep water, while those which are more modern usually rise\r\nfrom continental shelves, the channels intervening between them and the\r\nmainland being less than 100 fathoms deep. Oceanic islands rise from\r\ndeep water, are either volcanic or so far as their emerged portions are\r\nconcerned composed of coral rock, and are without warm-blooded\r\nterrestrial animals.\r\n\r\nAbout the borders of North America there are islands belonging to each\r\nof these classes. The numerous examples rising from the continental\r\nshelf all about the margin of the land, but in the Atlantic most\r\nnumerous from New York northward, and in the Pacific from the Strait of\r\nFuca northward, are plainly recent continental islands. The larger of\r\nthe West Indies and the group of small islands off the California coast\r\nare also continental islands, but show by the character of their faunas\r\nand the depth of the water about them that they have been long separated\r\nfrom the main mass of the continent. Typical examples of oceanic islands\r\nare furnished by Bermuda, in the Atlantic, and Guadalupe, in the\r\nPacific. In this same class, but less remote from the mainland, and in\r\ntheir faunas and floras showing a nearer relationship to South than to\r\nNorth America, belong the Caribbees.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TOPOGRAPHY OF THE COAST\r\n\r\nThe generalized coast-line of North America measures about 35,000 miles\r\nin extent, and presents a great variety of scenery. The range in\r\ndiversity embraces all classes of coast topography from the low, sandy\r\nmangrove-fringed borders of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, to the\r\nmagnificent sea-cliffs of Labrador and British Columbia and the\r\nmarvellous ice-walls of Greenland and Alaska where tide-water glaciers\r\nenter the ocean.\r\n\r\nLike nearly all the features of the earth's surface, this narrow\r\nintricate belt where the sea and land meet is constantly undergoing\r\nchanges. The principal processes which lead to alterations in the\r\ncoast-line may be considered as forming three groups: First, the wearing\r\naway of the land through the action of waves and currents and the\r\ndeposition of the _debris_ thus produced so as to make additions to the\r\nborders of the continent; second, the upward and downward movements of\r\nthe land; and third, the changes produced by glaciers, ice-flows, and\r\nicebergs.\r\n\r\nWith these more active agencies by which the coast-line is being\r\nmodified may be included chemical solution and deposition, the influence\r\nof plants and animals, the weathering of the margin of the land, etc.;\r\nbut a critical review of all these processes is impracticable in the\r\npresent treatise.\r\n\r\n_Changes in the Coast-Line due to Waves and Currents._--The waves of the\r\nsea beat on the land with never-ceasing activity, but exert the greatest\r\nforce during storms. The blow which a great surge strikes when it breaks\r\nat the base of a cliff, amounting in many instances to 3 or more tons to\r\nthe square foot, tends to disrupt the rocks both directly by its impact\r\nand by the compression of air and water in their interstices. The\r\ngreatest work of the breaking waves is performed, however, with the aid\r\nof the stones which accumulate on the beaches. These are hurled against\r\nthe land by the force of the landward-rushing waters and break and\r\nabrade the rocks with which they come in contact. The friction produced\r\nby the impact of waves charged with sand, pebbles, and boulders against\r\nthe land leads to its removal along a horizontal belt with a narrow\r\nvertical range. The waves of the sea, in fact, act like a horizontal\r\nsaw, the edge of which slowly advances landward. As a result of this\r\nprocess of under-cutting, highly characteristic and frequently most\r\npicturesque forms are given to rocky coasts. Whenever the sea is\r\nbordered by hard rocks standing well above the surface, but not rising\r\ntoo precipitously from deep water, we find cliffs facing seaward.\r\nAt the base of each of these sea-cliffs there is a shelf or terrace\r\nwhich records, in part at least, the advance that the sea has made\r\ninland.\r\n\r\nA cross profile of a wave-cut seashore (Fig. 5) shows two prominent\r\nfeatures, namely, a sea-cliff with a horizontal base, and a terrace\r\nsloping seaward from the foot of the cliff. Of these, the cliff is by\r\nfar the more prominent as it stands up boldly to view, while the terrace\r\nis in large part and perhaps wholly submerged. These two leading\r\ncharacteristics in the topography of wave-cut shores are shown in the\r\nfollowing diagram:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Ideal profile of a sea-cliff and current-built\r\nterrace.]\r\n\r\nThe water carried landward by each wave as it rushes up the sloping\r\nsurface of a terrace again finds its way seaward, either wholly or in\r\npart, as an \"undertow.\" Much of the rock _debris_ ground fine by the\r\nceaseless beating of the surf is separated from the coarser material,\r\nthus leaving the latter free to be moved by succeeding waves, and is\r\ncarried seaward by the bottom current or undertow. During storms\r\nespecially there is usually to be seen a belt of discoloured water\r\nseaward from the white breakers which margin the land. The finer\r\n_debris_ carried away from the shore by the undertow is sooner or later\r\ndeposited, and much of it is laid down on the terrace bordering the land\r\nand serves to build out its seaward margin. A normal sea-terrace is thus\r\nin part the result of the cutting away of the land, and in part of the\r\ndeposition of the material removed. The sea not only cuts away the land,\r\nhowever, but at many localities makes important additions to it.\r\n\r\nWhere the water is shallow the larger waves break at a distance perhaps\r\nof several miles from the coast-line, and build up long narrow bars,\r\nusually of sand, which form barriers, more or less parallel with the\r\nshore, and shelter it from further encroachments of the sea. Again, when\r\nthe wind from the sea blows obliquely to the coast, currents are\r\nestablished in the water which sweep along the loose material on the\r\nbeach and on the submerged portion of the terrace of which the beach is\r\na visible part, and cause it to travel in the general direction of the\r\nprevailing on-shore winds. This action also leads to the building of\r\nbars more or less parallel with the coast and at the extremities of\r\ncapes, particularly where the shore currents enter deeper water and give\r\norigin to spits of various shapes, which are frequently curved towards\r\nthe land and at their extremities become hooks and loops.\r\n\r\nThere are thus two important processes, one destructive and the other\r\nconstructive, by which the sea is continually modifying the border of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nWhen once the underlying principles on which depend the characteristics\r\nof coastal topography are suggested, any observant person can apply them\r\nfor himself and thus be able to read the history as well as admire the\r\nbeauties of seacoast scenery. It is not necessary, therefore, to attempt\r\nto present a detailed account of the coasts of North America from a\r\npurely geographical point of view; there are certain results of the\r\nprocesses just referred to, however, which are of wide-reaching\r\neconomic, and especially of commercial interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--A portion of the Atlantic coast of the United\r\nStates.]\r\n\r\nFrom Central America northward to Cape Cod the rocks bordering the sea\r\nare soft or easily soluble, and the adjacent land of low relief.\r\nThroughout this section the work of the sea is mostly constructive, and\r\nthe margin of the land is sheltered by sand-bars from the attack of\r\nwaves and currents. Where the waves of the open ocean do reach the land,\r\nas on the coast of New Jersey, the sea-cliffs are low and the topography\r\nof a mild type. Very generally, as along the coast of Mexico and Texas,\r\nand from Florida to Long Island, there are long narrow bars adjacent to\r\nthe shore, with lagoons intervening between them and the mainland.\r\nThese features are well illustrated on the accompanying map (Fig. 6) of\r\na portion of the Atlantic coast where long narrow bars, sometimes\r\nforming skeleton capes, are a characteristic feature. On the middle\r\nAtlantic coast of the United States the prevailing winds blow southward\r\nand there is a general southward flow of the shore currents, which carry\r\nwith them the sand on the beaches and bars. An interesting fact in this\r\nconnection, pointed out by N. S. Shaler, is that although the sands are\r\ncontinually being moved they are not worn out. After the sand-grains\r\nhave been reduced to a certain size they retain films of water which\r\nseparate them one from another, and act as cushions which prevent the\r\ngrains from coming in contact, thus greatly retarding further\r\ncomminution. But for the protection thus afforded the sand-bars would be\r\nremoved and the border of the land exposed to the attack of the waves\r\nand cut away; whereas under existing conditions lagoons are formed,\r\nwhich in many instances are utilized as harbours or are filled by\r\nwind-blown sand, the sediment brought by streams, plant growths, etc.,\r\nand valuable additions are made to the continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Mobile Bay.]\r\n\r\nThe sand-bars just referred to frequently cross the mouths of rivers,\r\nand in such instances a struggle ensues between the currents moving\r\nalong the shore and the outflowing river-waters aided by the currents\r\nproduced by the tides. This conflict leads to the formation of sand\r\nbanks and bars, generally submerged, across the entrances of bays and\r\ninlets and to the building of sand-spits from the seaward capes. A\r\ntypical instance is furnished at the entrance of Mobile Bay (Fig. 7),\r\nwhere a spit from each side has been built by shore currents so as\r\nto greatly contract the tideway between. Similar features are presented\r\nby Sandy Hook and Coney Island, each of which has been built of sand\r\ndeposited by shore currents at the seaward entrance of the lower New\r\nYork Bay. Another illustration of this same general character is\r\nfurnished by the curved extremity of Cape Cod (Fig. 8), which is a\r\nsand-spit of large size with a hooked extremity. Spits of this nature\r\nare common on our coasts, and in many instances themselves form\r\nharbours, as at Coney Island and near the extremity of Cape Cod. Many\r\nother similar examples of the importance of lagoons, sand-bars, spits,\r\netc., to shipping, which occur, especially along the Atlantic coast of\r\nthe United States, may be studied to advantage on the admirable charts\r\nof the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Cape Cod, Massachusetts.]\r\n\r\nThe sand-bars, spits, and other similar structures along the Atlantic\r\ncoast are also of strategic importance, for the reason that they afford\r\nadvantageous sites for fortifications, as is illustrated by the strong\r\nforts at Sandy Hook which guard the entrance of New York Bay. These\r\nsea-built foundations are also utilized in a large number of localities\r\nfor lighthouses. The waterways shut off from the sea by off-shore bars\r\nin some instances permit of the passage of vessels from one harbour to\r\nanother. In this connection it is of interest to note that an important\r\nsystem of canals is under consideration for making a continuous waterway\r\nfor deep-draft vessels, some 700 miles long, which will connect the\r\nestuaries and lagoons from New York to the Carolinas.\r\n\r\nWhile the islands of sand referred to present many conditions favourable\r\nto commerce, fisheries, and other industries, their apparent durability\r\nis deceptive, and in some instances faith in their permanence has led to\r\ndisastrous results. They owe their existence to the action of waves and\r\ncurrents, and unless blown sand is heaped upon them are raised but a few\r\nfeet above mean sea-level, and are liable to inundation if a high tide\r\nis accompanied by an on-shore gale. A sad illustration of this plain\r\nconclusion is furnished by the disaster that overwhelmed the city of\r\nGalveston on the night of September 8, 1900, during which some 3,000\r\npeople perished and $20,000,000 to $30,000,000 worth of property was\r\ndestroyed. This great loss was in large part due to the fact that the\r\ncity was inundated by the advance over its site of the storm-driven\r\nwaters of the Gulf of Mexico. The island on which Galveston stands (Fig.\r\n9) was built by the waters of the Gulf, and during the hurricane\r\nreferred to they again claimed their own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Coast of Texas.]\r\n\r\nNorthward of Cape Cod, the rocks adjacent to the ocean are mostly hard\r\nand resistant, consisting largely of schist, gneiss, granite, trap,\r\netc., which when undercut by the waves stand as bold cliffs and\r\nheadlands. This portion of the continental border abounds in picturesque\r\nscenery and is abundantly supplied with fine harbours and well-sheltered\r\nhavens in which boats may take refuge. Typical portions of this\r\nrugged coast are furnished by the magnificent sea-cliffs of Mount Desert\r\nand Grand Manan islands, the bold shores of Newfoundland and Labrador,\r\nand the precipitous border of Greenland. The scenery throughout nearly\r\nall of this vast extent of wave and storm beaten rocks is in striking\r\ncontrast to the mild and generally monotonous sand-built shores to the\r\nsouth of Cape Cod. Between the angular headlands and rugged capes at the\r\nnorth, with their white girdles of surf, there are frequently curved\r\nbeaches and numerous spits and bars of yellow sand which connect the\r\nsalients of the shore or extend from them so as to furnish safe\r\nanchorages.\r\n\r\nOn the arctic coast of North America the action of the waves and\r\ncurrents on the land is greatly retarded by ice, and the tides are\r\nsmall, but to what extent these conditions unfavourable to the work of\r\nthe sea are counterbalanced by the abrasion performed by ice-floes is\r\nunknown. The northern border of Alaska, as well as the shore of Bering\r\nSea, is mostly low and the rocks soft, although certain of the sea-capes\r\nare bold and are evidently composed of resistant material.\r\n\r\nThe Aleutian Islands present a peculiar exception to the general coast\r\ntopography of the rest of the continent. Although this region has not\r\nbeen studied in detail, it seems to furnish an example of a rugged\r\nmountain range that has been partially submerged at a comparatively\r\nrecent date. The rocks in many places descend precipitously into deep\r\nwater, leaving no room for the formation of beaches, and hence the\r\nwaves, to a great extent, are without tools with which to cut away the\r\nland. At the heads of the many bays and inlets, however, one finds\r\nbeautiful sand-beaches with gracefully curving lines, in striking\r\ncontrast to the dark, rugged cliffs bordering their seaward extensions.\r\n\r\nThe southern and southeastern borders of Alaska are exceedingly bold,\r\nand present some of the most sublime coast scenery to be found in the\r\nworld, but to the geographer the greatest interest of this portion of\r\nthe continental border, as is true also of the entire Pacific coast of\r\nNorth America, centres in its relation to up and down movements of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n_Changes in the Coast-Line due to Oscillation of the Land._--Land areas\r\nare exposed to the erosive action of wind, rain, streams, etc., and are\r\nsculptured by these agencies into valleys, canyons, peaks, ridges, and\r\nother familiar topographic forms. The various processes by which land\r\nareas are modified lead in general to a roughening of the surface. As an\r\nextreme illustration, a high plateau becomes dissected by streams so as\r\nto form an intricate system of rugged mountain ridges and peaks, with\r\ndeep, steep-sided valleys between. The degree of this roughening depends\r\nprincipally on the elevation of the land, together with contrasts in the\r\nresistance of the rocks due mainly to variation in hardness, climatic\r\nconditions, etc., but in general one may say the higher the land\r\nis raised above the sea the more rugged will be its topography as the\r\nprocess of wearing away progresses. It is to be remembered in this\r\nconnection, however, that land areas pass through a somewhat definite\r\nseries of changes, from topographic youth to topographic old age, each\r\nstage being accompanied by changes in the relief. It is during\r\ntopographic maturity that the greatest roughness of the surface of a\r\nland area is produced.\r\n\r\nLand areas are continually wasting away, owing especially to the attacks\r\nof the streams, and the material removed is deposited in the sea. The\r\n_debris_ brought from the continents by streams is laid down in shallow\r\nwater--about the shores of North America almost entirely on the surface\r\nof the continental shelf--and in this region of deposition the hollows\r\nare filled and a generally smooth surface given to the sea-floor.\r\n\r\nThe topography of the land, for the reason stated above, is nearly\r\neverywhere uneven; while the topography of the sea-floor is\r\ncharacterized by uniformity. We can easily predict, therefore, the\r\ngeneral character of the changes in a coast which would result from\r\neither a subsidence of the land, thus allowing the sea to encroach upon\r\nit, or of an elevation, which would expose a portion of the sea-bottom,\r\nthereby increasing the area of the land. A subsidence of the land\r\nadjacent to the sea permits an extension of the waters landward; the sea\r\nwill enter the valleys so as to form estuaries, bays, straits, etc.,\r\nwhile the high land between the partially water-filled depressions will\r\nrise above the water-level and appear as peninsulas, capes, and islands.\r\nA bold, deeply sculptured coast when depressed will give origin to an\r\nintricate, and what may be termed a ragged shore-line; while a lower\r\nregion crossed by large river-valleys would be changed to a system of\r\nbroad estuaries.\r\n\r\nAn upward movement in the earth's crust along the ocean's shore would\r\nexpose a portion of the sea-floor and add a strip of generally level\r\ncountry to the previous land area. The boundary between the old and new\r\ntopography in such an instance would be the upraised coast-line with\r\nits sea-cliffs, wave-cut caves, terraces, beaches, and other\r\ncharacteristic features of coast topography.\r\n\r\nThere are thus two strongly contrasted types of coast scenery, produced\r\nby oscillations of the earth's crust where ocean and continents meet. In\r\neach class there is a wide range in details, which vary in harmony with\r\nthe amount the land rises or falls in reference to sea-level.\r\n\r\nWhen one has these general laws in mind a map of the coast-line of North\r\nAmerica acquires great significance.\r\n\r\nFrom about the latitude of New York southward to Central America many\r\ncomparatively small oscillations of the land have occurred in recent\r\ngeological time, and what was formerly a portion of the continental\r\nshelf is now exposed and forms a coastal plain. This plain, in general\r\nfrom 50 to 100 miles broad, slopes gently seaward, and its continuation\r\nunder the sea forms the present continental shelf (Fig. 2). Evidently a\r\nslight up or down movement or a gentle tilting of this partially\r\nsubmerged plain in an east and west direction would cause a marked\r\nadvance or recession of the sea. Each time the sea advanced the country\r\nsubmerged would be smoothed over by the action of the waves and currents\r\nand a sheet of sediment laid down upon it; and each time the sea receded\r\nthe emerged land would be trenched by the rivers flowing across it. The\r\nrecords show that many such changes have occurred.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf border of Mexico and Texas, composed of soft marine sediments,\r\nforms a gently sloping plain bordered on the west by a roughened upland,\r\nand illustrates the general feature of a recently emerged coastal plain\r\n(Fig. 9). The same is true also of the entire coast from Texas to New\r\nYork, but it happens that a recent movement through this region was of\r\nsuch a nature as to allow the sea to encroach on the land, and the\r\npreviously excavated stream valleys are now, in part, occupied by the\r\nsea. This feature is most marked from the Carolinas to New York (Fig.\r\n6), where there are several great estuaries and drowned river-valleys\r\nwhich extend far into the land. The best examples are Albemarle Sound\r\nand Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. The James River channel is submerged\r\nas far as Richmond, the Potomac to Washington, the Susquehanna to\r\nHarrisburg, the Delaware to Trenton, and the Hudson to Troy. These are\r\ntypical illustrations of what geographers term drowned river-valleys.\r\nThey are evidence that the land formerly stood higher than now, was\r\ntrenched by the rivers that flowed across it, and was then depressed or\r\ntilted so as to allow the sea to encroach upon it. The importance of\r\nthese events in the settlement of North America by Europeans and on the\r\nsubsequent development of commerce, manufactures, the location of\r\ncities, etc., needs only to be suggested to permit the reader to fill in\r\nthe details for himself.\r\n\r\nOn the Gulf coast and about Florida the later movements of the land have\r\nbeen less than in the region from Albemarle Sound to New York, and\r\nestuaries are there absent, with the somewhat marked exception of Mobile\r\nBay. Certain secondary conditions need to be introduced here, but space\r\nwill not permit of more than a brief presentation of them. Not only have\r\nthe recent movements of the land been less about the shores of the Gulf\r\nof Mexico than in the middle Atlantic region of the United States, but\r\nthe rivers at the south are in general smaller and less swift than those\r\nfarther north, and hence are less able to excavate broad valleys. The\r\nSouthern rivers, such as the Alabama, Mississippi, Rio Grande, etc., are\r\nsilt-laden and tend to fill their estuaries, while the weaker streams\r\nare unable to resist the encroachments of sand-bars and spits built by\r\nshore currents, and their mouths have been practically closed. The coast\r\nof Texas gives evidence of slight modern subsidence, but the small\r\nestuaries formed have, for the most part, been separated from the Gulf\r\nby sand-bars.\r\n\r\nNorthward of the middle Atlantic region the recent oscillations of the\r\nland continued to increase and reached a maximum about the shores of the\r\nArctic Ocean; on the Pacific coast also there is similar evidence of an\r\nincrease in the recent earth movements from the south northward.\r\n\r\nIn an outline sketch of the present coastal topography of the continent\r\nwe can generalize, and say that the whole continent during the late\r\nTertiary, glacial, and recent times has swayed up and down about a\r\nhinge-line situated in the region of the Gulf of Mexico, and the\r\nmovements, although not uniform, have increased in amount from the south\r\nnorthward. Let us glance at the evidence on which this broad statement,\r\ninvolving the up and down surging of a vast continent, is based.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson, as stated above, is a drowned river as far as Troy, a\r\ndistance from the present land margin of 160 miles. In the next great\r\nriver to the northward, the St. Lawrence, the tide rises and falls\r\nnearly up to Montreal, a distance of about 800 miles from the general\r\nshore-line. Still farther north are Hudson Strait and Hudson Bay, which,\r\nalthough but imperfectly explored, seem to be an example not only of the\r\ndrowning of a river-valley, but of the largest part of a river-basin.\r\nThe geography of the arctic archipelago fringing the north shore of the\r\ncontinent also suggests that a strongly stream-cut plateau has there\r\nbeen deeply submerged.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the drowned river-valleys and ragged coasts which record\r\na subsidence of the land, there are raised terraces and beaches which\r\nbegin at the south near New York and increase in elevation above the\r\npresent sea-level, when followed northward, all the way to the arctic\r\nregion, and have in the far north an altitude of about 1,200 feet. These\r\nold beaches and terraces show that the land was formerly depressed and\r\nhas since risen; but, as shown above, has not regained the elevation it\r\nhad previous to the glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nThe marked differences in the geography of the coast from New York\r\nnorthward to the Arctic Ocean, and from the same locality southward to\r\nCentral America, are due primarily to the fact that the oscillations of\r\nthe land have been such that at the north the continental shelf is\r\nentirely submerged and the sea has encroached on a rough land; while at\r\nthe south the recent oscillations have been less and a broad margin of\r\nthe continental shelf is exposed and forms the coastal plain.\r\n\r\nAt the north, we find innumerable islands, bold, rocky shores with many\r\ncapes and headlands, separated by deep inlets, sounds, straits,\r\nbays, etc., or, in brief, a ragged coast such as finds typical\r\nillustration on the shores of Maine (Fig. 10), while at the south (Fig.\r\n6) the shores are low, sandy, remarkably uniform in trend, and without\r\nislands, excepting such as are built by the waves and currents. The West\r\nIndia Islands will, no doubt, be recalled by the reader, but their\r\nhistory is again different. Intermediate between the land that has\r\nexperienced great oscillation at the north and the region of less\r\nenergetic movements at the south is the series of large estuaries\r\nmentioned above, in the narrower portions of the coastal plain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--A portion of the coast of Maine.]\r\n\r\nThe northern and western coasts of Alaska are mostly low, and correspond\r\nin a general way with the coastal plan of the Carolina region. The last\r\nwell-marked movement of the land in that region has been in the\r\ndirection of an elevation, and we find low shores, with but few\r\nharbours, similar in many ways to the coast of Texas.\r\n\r\nIt is probably true, as already stated, that the Aleutian Islands,\r\nalthough in part the result of recent volcanic activity, owe their\r\npeculiar and exceptional characteristics to the partial subsidence of a\r\ndeeply sculptured mountain range. On the south coast of Alaska, in the\r\nregion of Mount St. Elias and Mount Fairweather, a recent and\r\nextensive elevation has occurred, which, however, did not bring the\r\nbottom of the adjacent portion of the ocean above the sea-level. This\r\napparent anomaly seems to be due to an uprising of the rocks along the\r\nnorth side of a break, or belt of branching fractures, which closely\r\napproximates to the coast-line and has determined the position of the\r\ncontinental border in that region. The facts, so far as known, appear to\r\nshow that we have here what geologists term a fault, the north or\r\nlandward side of which has been raised at least 5,000 feet in very\r\nmodern times, but, so far as we can judge, without disturbing the\r\nseaward border of the break. The coast between Mount Fairweather and\r\nMount St. Elias is by far the boldest, and from a scenic point of view\r\nthe most impressive, portion of the entire shore-line of North America.\r\nThe mountains are young and among the highest on the continent. They\r\nrise precipitously from the margin of the sea, and are sheathed in snow\r\nand ice from base to summit throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThe margin of the continent southward from Mount Fairweather to the\r\nColumbia River, a distance in a straight line of about 1,200 miles,\r\nfurnishes some of the best illustrations of the changes in coastal\r\ngeography due to subsidence that our continent affords (Fig. 11). This\r\nwonderfully irregular coast is fringed with a belt of mountainous\r\nislands from 50 to 100 or more miles broad. The inlets between the bold\r\ncapes and the straits separating the numerous islands are deep. The\r\nrugged, forest-clothed slopes with precipitous, and in many instances\r\nnearly vertical walls, descend into water that is frequently from 50 to\r\nover 200 fathoms deep. In brief, a deeply dissected mountain range more\r\nthan 1,000 miles in length has there been depressed at least 2,000 feet\r\nbelow its former altitude, thus allowing the sea to flood its deep,\r\npicturesque valleys.\r\n\r\nPuget Sound, with its numerous and frequently narrow arms (Fig. 23), is\r\nthe southward extension of the partially inundated country considered\r\nabove. To the west of this magnificent sound rise the Olympic Mountains,\r\nwhich barely escape being an island at the present stage of the\r\nswaying of the land. On the west, as on the east border of the\r\ncontinent, there are drowned river-valleys, such as the Stikine, Frazer,\r\nColumbia, and Sacramento. It is not to be understood, however, that the\r\nentire Pacific coast region has been raised or depressed as a unit.\r\nThere have been differential movements in some of its parts, but these\r\nare not as yet well known. In southern California, for example, raised\r\nbeaches and a narrow coastal plain about Los Angeles give evidence of a\r\nmodern rise of the land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Coast of southeastern Alaska.]\r\n\r\nIn reference to the broad generalization that the continental mass of\r\nNorth America has undergone up and down movements, greatest at the north\r\nand decreasing southward, as if moving on a hinge-line running east and\r\nwest in the region of the Gulf of Mexico, it is of interest to note that\r\nthe ragged coasts of Maine, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and\r\nLabrador, due to the partial submergence of a rugged land, lie in the\r\nsame latitudes as the equally ragged coast of Washington, British\r\nColumbia, and Alaska. This is more than a coincidence. The rocks on the\r\ntwo coasts are similar, being for the most part resistant crystalline\r\nschists, gneisses, granites, etc., and in each instance stood high above\r\nthe sea for a long period during which they were deeply trenched by\r\nstreams and by great glaciers, and then at about the same time, as\r\nnearly as can be judged, each region was depressed so as to allow the\r\nsea to encroach upon it.\r\n\r\nWhile a deeply sculptured land when partially submerged gives origin to\r\na ragged coast, a region of similar elevation, but not cut by streams or\r\nother agencies so as to have deep valleys, when subsidence occurs\r\nproduces a bold, harbourless shore without islands. The striking\r\ncontrast between the deeply indented border of the continent, with its\r\nbroad fringe of islands, from Mount Fairweather southward to Mount\r\nOlympus, and the remarkably uniform although bold coast-line from Mount\r\nOlympus southward to Mexico, and indeed nearly to Cape Horn, has much\r\nsignificance in this connection.\r\n\r\nThe mountains bordering the Pacific coast of the United States are among\r\nthe younger on the continent. These coast ranges, largely on account of\r\ntheir youth, have not been deeply sculptured, but rise boldly from the\r\nocean's shore throughout nearly the entire distance from the Strait of\r\nFuca to the end of the peninsula of Lower California. The mountains of\r\nCentral America, although but little known, are of comparatively recent\r\ndate, but differ from the coast ranges in being more largely built of\r\nyoung volcanic rocks. Both the coast ranges and the mountains of Central\r\nAmerica are much less deeply sculptured than the mountains bordering the\r\nPacific to the north of Puget Sound, and a subsidence along this shore\r\nwould produce but moderate changes in the coast-line. In this great\r\nextent of coast, measuring nearly 5,000 miles, there are but few\r\nharbours; in the portion belonging to the United States the generally\r\nbold coast-line is broken but in two places, one where the\r\nColumbia reaches the sea, and the other where the Sacramento finds an\r\noutlet through the portions of its drowned valley known as the Golden\r\nGate.\r\n\r\nThe Bay of San Francisco owes its origin to a subsidence of the land\r\nwhich has admitted the sea into the valley of the Sacramento, but this\r\nvalley, which, uniting with the one at the south drained by the San\r\nJoaquin, forms the Great Valley of California, is not due to stream\r\nerosion, as in the case of the drowned valley of the Hudson or of the\r\nSt. Lawrence, but to the upraising of the mountains bordering it. During\r\na former time of greater subsidence than at present the Bay of San\r\nFrancisco was larger than now, and has been contracted both by the\r\ndeposition of sediment and by a partial re-elevation of the land. The\r\nexceptional character of the Bay of San Francisco and its marked\r\nexcellence as a harbour give to the city on its shore promises of\r\nmarvellous development.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf of California is due, in a general view, to what may be\r\nconsidered as a departure of the Coast mountains away from the general\r\ntrend of the continental border. We have but little detailed information\r\nconcerning this region, however, and the studies of modern geographers\r\nhave likewise been meagre throughout all the coast-line farther south.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific coast of Mexico is geographically similar to that of\r\nCalifornia, but instead of a single great harbour there are four of\r\nmoderate size and excellence, the histories of which have not been\r\nstudied. Farther south, along the Central American coast, the shores are\r\nbold, but several indentations, due in part at least to volcanic\r\nagencies, furnish shelter for vessels and offer encouragement to\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nThe bold and not deeply sculptured mountains along the nearly unbroken\r\ncoast from the Strait of Fuca to Panama, rise close to the true border\r\nof the continent. The continental shelf of this portion of the shore of\r\nthe Pacific is narrow. An elevation of 100 fathoms would add scarcely\r\nmore than 10 miles to the extent of the land. This narrowness of the\r\ncontinental shelf seems to be due to the recency of the uplifting\r\nof the Coast mountains, and the lack of time for the _debris_ from the\r\nland and the organic refuse of the sea to shoal the water. The Pacific\r\nbasin is deep close to the land bordering it, thus restricting the\r\nseaward extension of the continental shelf.\r\n\r\n_Changes in the Coast-Line due to Ice._--It is now well known that\r\nglacial ice many hundreds of feet thick formerly covered the northern\r\nhalf of North America and flowed outward across the present position of\r\nthe coast-line throughout all of the northern border of the continent\r\nfrom Staten Island in the east and Puget Sound in the west, with the\r\nexception of the Arctic and Bering Sea coasts of Alaska.\r\n\r\nThe effects of this outward-flowing ice on the topography of the\r\ncontinental border crossed by it were in general in two directions.\r\nWhere the land was rough or moderately so previous to the coming of the\r\nice-sheets the inequalities of surface were increased; but where the\r\nland was smooth or but gently undulating its elevations were planed away\r\nby the glaciers and made still more smooth. The reason for these\r\ndifferences is that when the land from which the ice flowed was rugged\r\nor had previously been deeply trenched by streams, the valleys gave\r\ndirection to the ice currents and the margins of the continental\r\nice-sheets became divided into separate ice-streams, as is the case in\r\nGreenland at the present day. This localization of the ice currents\r\nserved to deepen and broaden the pre-existing valleys, and especially on\r\nthe bold coast of Alaska and British Columbia increased in a marked way\r\nthe inequalities of the surface and favoured the production of a ragged\r\ncoast-line when the ice melted and was replaced in part by the sea.\r\nWhen, however, the topography of the land was not sufficiently accented\r\nto cause the ice flowing over it to gather into well-defined currents\r\nthe general surface was worn down, thus favouring the production of an\r\neven coast-line after the melting of the ice-sheets.\r\n\r\nWhere the coast-lands were high and rugged, the deepening and broadening\r\nof the valleys led to the origin of deep, narrow, canal-like waterways\r\ntermed fiords (_fjords_), when the ice withdrew from the partially\r\nsubmerged land or when subsequent depression carried the glaciated\r\ntroughs below sea-level. On the Atlantic coast from Maine to Labrador,\r\nand thence northward to the Arctic Ocean, there are numerous examples of\r\nfiords, as is also the case on the Pacific coast from Mount St. Elias to\r\nPuget Sound. At the present time the localized ice-streams from the\r\ngreat central ice-sheet of Greenland are continuing this process of\r\nfiord excavation. The same is true also, but on a much smaller scale, of\r\nthe tide-water glaciers of southern Alaska.\r\n\r\nThe shores of the northern portion of the continent from New England to\r\nthe Aleutian Islands are now being modified by the grinding of\r\nice-floes, which are driven against the land by the wind. This process,\r\nhowever, although locally important, need claim but little attention in\r\na general view of the geography of the continent.\r\n\r\n_Changes in the Coast-Line due to the Deposits made by Streams._--The\r\nvisible loads of silt and sand in suspension carried to the ocean by\r\nstreams, as well as the material the streams roll and push along their\r\nbottoms, is delivered to the waters of the ocean and deposited in\r\nvarious ways. Much of this material, notably the coarser portion, is\r\ndropped near land and the finer portion floated far out from the coast\r\nbefore settling to the bottom. Two classes of deposits made in this way\r\nmay be recognised, namely, those laid down by the streams themselves as\r\nthey drop their loads on entering still water, or delta deposits; and\r\nthose spread over the sea-floor by waves and currents after receiving\r\nthe _debris_ brought from the land. Which of these two modes of\r\ndeposition will prevail depends on whether the waters of the ocean at\r\nthe localities where the streams deliver their loads are essentially\r\nstill or are affected by strong currents. In the former instance all but\r\nthe finer of the _debris_ derived from the land is quickly dropped and\r\ndeltas are formed; and in the second instance the currents bear the\r\nmaterial away and deposit it either in the shallow water adjacent to the\r\nneighbouring shore, forming shoals, bars, embankments, spits, etc., or\r\nspread it in a sheet over the sea-floor. The most notable changes\r\nin the coast-line resulting from this general process occur where\r\nsilt-laden streams enter still water and form deltas.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of North America many of the streams which enter estuaries\r\ndeliver their loads to waters which are agitated, especially by tidal\r\ncurrents, and ill-defined shoals, sand-banks, etc., are produced. In\r\nthree conspicuous instances, however, large rivers are engaged in\r\nbuilding deltas, and thus producing well-marked changes in the\r\ncoast-line.\r\n\r\nAt the north, the Mackenzie enters the nearly tideless Arctic Ocean,\r\nwhere floating ice almost completely counteracts the tendency of the\r\nwind to produce currents, and a great delta is being extended seaward.\r\nThe river divides on its delta into many _distributaries_ and enters the\r\nsea by several mouths. The sea near the mouths of the river is reported\r\nto be shallow, and obstructed by many sand-banks and islands. No survey\r\nof the Mackenzie delta has as yet been made, and but little definite\r\ninformation concerning it is available.\r\n\r\nThe Yukon on entering the shallow eastern portion of Bering Sea, where\r\nthe influence of the tides is small and floating ice is present\r\nthroughout about nine months each year, is also engaged in building a\r\ngreat delta which projects into the sea and gives the coast-line a bold\r\noutward curve. The Yukon begins to divide into separate channels,\r\nseveral of which enter the sea as independent distributaries at a\r\ndistance of about 150 miles from the outer border of its delta. The\r\ndistance between the outer finger-like division of the stream is about\r\n90 miles. The Yukon is a graded stream--i. e., is able to carry material\r\nin suspension, but not to deepen or fill its channel--in the lower\r\nportion of its course, and is making an important addition to the land\r\nowing to the dropping of its burden of silt as soon as the still water\r\ninto which it flows is reached. The stream is thus being extended, and\r\nin order to enable it to continue its task of transportation and the\r\ndelivery of its load to the sea, the extended portion of its channel is\r\nbuilt up so as to give a slope down which the waters can\r\nflow--that is, the beds of the distributaries are raised, and they also\r\nshift their positions from time to time and make additions to the entire\r\nsurface of the delta. This extension of the stream and deposition of\r\nsilt by its distributaries have added about 1,000 square miles to the\r\nland. Although the delta of the Yukon presents an admirable example of\r\nthe change in a coast-line produced by the sediment dropped by a great\r\nriver, the partial surveys of it that have been made are not as yet\r\navailable for study.\r\n\r\nFully as characteristic of the modification of coast-lines made by a\r\nstream as any in the world is the well-known example of the delta of the\r\nMississippi. This classical instance illustrates not only the manner in\r\nwhich coast-lines are modified, but the behaviour of a large silt-laden\r\nstream which has reduced its valley to a low gradient, and throughout\r\nhundreds of miles of its lower course is spreading out a wide flood\r\nplain. The extension seaward of this flood plain forms the broad delta\r\nat the river's mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Delta of the Mississippi. After United States\r\nCoast and Geodetic Survey.]\r\n\r\nDuring high-water stages the Mississippi widely over-spreads its banks\r\nand during such inundations of its valley drops much of the silt it\r\npreviously held in suspension. The material deposited is laid down most\r\nabundantly on the immediate border of its low-water channel. Each side\r\nof the channel is thus raised so as to form what is termed a natural\r\nlevee. During this process also the bed of the stream is raised by the\r\ndeposition of sediment upon it, thus tending to cause the stream to flow\r\non a raised ridge and producing an unstable condition which from time to\r\ntime enables the river to break across its confining levees and divide\r\ninto two or more separate channels. In the lower portion of the river\r\nsome of the new channels thus formed reach the sea and furnish\r\nindependent outlets for its waters. The first of these distributaries\r\nnow departs from the main channel at a distance of 200 miles from the\r\nGulf of Mexico, and farther seaward several other divisions occur (Fig.\r\n12). The area of the delta is about 1,230 square miles. Each\r\ndistributary is engaged in building a pair of embankments, or natural\r\nlevees (although this process in recent years has been modified by the\r\nconstruction of artificial embankments for the sake of improving\r\nnavigation), and each subdivision of the river is also building a delta.\r\nEach of the finger-like extensions of the delta, shown on the\r\naccompanying map, is due to the prolongation of a pair of embankments\r\ninto the Gulf by each distributary and the growth of a secondary delta\r\nat its mouth. The river is thus building a highly compound delta,\r\ncomposed of the secondary deltas formed at the mouth of each of its\r\ndistributaries. A conspicuous modification of the otherwise generally\r\nevenly curved border of the Gulf of Mexico is thus produced, a result\r\nthat could only be reached in a water body but little disturbed by wind\r\nor tidal currents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ESTUARIES AND HARBOURS\r\n\r\nThe features of a coast of greatest importance to civilization are its\r\nharbours. A coast without harbours is like a Chinese wall, and tends to\r\nisolate a people inclosed by it. An indented coast with numerous havens\r\nfor the shelter of vessels fosters the interests of navigation,\r\nincluding sea fisheries, invites commerce from other lands, and\r\nstimulates its inhabitants to explore and travel. A diversity of\r\nindustries is thus favoured and the people adjacent to an indented coast\r\nwith good harbours tend to become more progressive and more cosmopolitan\r\nthan if intercourse with other communities is confined to overland\r\nroutes.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic border of North America is abundantly supplied with fine\r\nharbours, which not only favour communication with distant countries,\r\nbut are within easy reach of agricultural and forest lands and important\r\ncoal and other mineral deposits adjacent to the coast or in the\r\ninterior, and are near extensive and valuable fishing grounds. The best\r\nof these harbours are at the mouths of rivers which have been depressed\r\nso as to form estuaries with wide entrances. These sea-gates, however,\r\nare frequently contracted, owing to the presence of sand-bars and spits\r\ndeposited by shore currents.\r\n\r\nThe great St. Lawrence estuary reaches to Montreal, and beyond lie the\r\nGreat Lakes, the rich lands of Ontario and New York, and the now\r\nhighly productive States of the Middle West. Two geographical features\r\nin this basin detract from the conditions otherwise highly favourable to\r\ncommercial development, namely: the rapids in the St. Lawrence between\r\nMontreal and Lake Ontario and the fall in the Niagara, and the winter\r\nclimate of Canada, which causes the rivers and estuaries to be ice-bound\r\nfor a considerable part of each year. To obviate the first of these\r\nunfavourable conditions far-reaching plans for a deep waterway between\r\nthe Great Lakes and the Atlantic are now being matured. The splendid\r\nharbours from Nova Scotia southward are never seriously obstructed by\r\nice, and south of Virginia ice is practically unknown.\r\n\r\nThe estuaries at the mouth of the Hudson, Delaware, Susquehanna,\r\nPotomac, James, and the Alabama, together with the distributaries of the\r\nMississippi (which is not a partially drowned river, but one that is\r\nbuilding up and extending its channel), are the natural outlets of\r\nportions of the continent of great fruitfulness. When other, and\r\nespecially climatic, conditions are considered, it will be seen that to\r\nthe geographer the Atlantic sea-border from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico seems destined to be the next great commercial centre\r\nin the succession from Greece to Britain. An important adjunct to the\r\npresent highly favourable geographical conditions pointing to a great\r\nfuture for civilization on the Atlantic coast is the construction of a\r\nship-canal across the isthmus uniting North and South America. This step\r\nmust soon be taken.\r\n\r\nA glance at a map of North America must impress one with the belief that\r\nthe Pacific coast with its great extent of harbourless water-front is\r\nfar less favourable to the growth or ideas, institutions, and industries\r\nthan the deeply indented Atlantic shore-line. From the Isthmus of Panama\r\nto the State of Washington there is, as we have seen, but one harbour of\r\nthe first class, the estuary of the Sacramento, and one of the second or\r\nthird class, the estuary of the Columbia. From Puget Sound northward\r\nharbours are numberless. There are two important geographical reasons,\r\nhowever, why the general absence of good harbours to the south of\r\nPuget Sound is not so serious as it perhaps might seem. First, the\r\nmountain ranges run north and south parallel with the coast, and the\r\nnatural lines of interior travel lead to the outlets through the Coast\r\nRanges traversed by the Sacramento and the Columbia. The second and more\r\ngeneral reason is that, owing to the warm currents in the Pacific, the\r\nportion of the west coast most favourable for a high degree of\r\ncivilization is situated farther north than the similar belt on the\r\nAtlantic border.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy way of a summary of this chapter, the reader is asked to bear in mind\r\nthe fact that the land forming North America, as is the case with all\r\ncontinents, is not at rest, but is subject to movements which cause\r\nelevations and depressions of various portions of its area with\r\nreference to sea-level. These movements have been in progress since the\r\nbirth of the continent, and still continue. An upward movement of the\r\nearth's crust where the land and ocean meet causes a portion of the\r\nsea-floor to emerge and an addition usually of the nature of a coastal\r\nplain to be made to the border of a continent; while a reverse movement\r\nenables the sea to advance on the land and to flood the low-grade\r\nvalleys opening to the ocean.\r\n\r\nIn a generalized view of the recent history of the coast-line of North\r\nAmerica the dominant fact is that to the north of the latitude of the\r\nnorth shore of the Gulf of Mexico the resultant of the later movements\r\nof the continent is downward; the amount of the depression thus caused\r\nincreases in a general way with increase in latitude on both the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific coasts. This downward movement has permitted the\r\nsea to encroach on the land and to flood many pre-existing valleys. On\r\nthe Atlantic coast it produced such estuaries as Chesapeake and Delaware\r\nBays, the tide-water portions of such rivers as the Hudson and the St.\r\nLawrence, and farther north, where the submergence was greater,\r\npermitted the sea to invade the continental basin and form Hudson Bay.\r\nTo this same wide-reaching cause is due also the bold ragged coast-line\r\nof the Atlantic from New England northward. On the Pacific border\r\nthe downward movement is recorded by the tide-water portions of the\r\nSacramento, Columbia, etc., and the deep picturesque fiords of the\r\nCanadian and Alaskan coasts. The most decided influence of these changes\r\nin the geography of the continent's margin on the affairs of men\r\nresulted from the production of numerous fine harbours and the extension\r\nof estuaries far inland, thus favouring commerce and fisheries in a high\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the oscillations just referred to, the sea has gained\r\nimportant characteristics as well as the land. The broad submerged shelf\r\nfringing the continent furnishes conditions highly favourable to both\r\nplant and animal life, and affords some of the most valuable\r\nfishing-banks of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Caribbean region is a marked exception to the broader changes that\r\nhave affected the coast-line throughout the central and northern\r\nportions of the continent, and stands by itself as a conspicuous\r\nillustration of more localized earth movements which produced a\r\nremarkable submarine topography.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LITERATURE\r\n\r\nIn continuation of the studies outlined in this chapter the following\r\nbooks, most of which contain more special references, will be found of\r\nassistance:\r\n\r\n  AGASSIZ, A. _Three Cruises of the Blake._ 2 vols.

These are, in their general order, from\r\neast to west:\r\n\r\n1. Coastal plains and plateaus, of which the country between the\r\nAtlantic Ocean and the Appalachian Mountains furnishes the most typical\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\n2. A series of mountain ranges embracing all of the more elevated\r\ncountry on the east side of the continent from Georgia northward to the\r\narctic archipelago, and in this book termed the _Atlantic Mountains_.\r\n\r\n3. The great system of plains and plateaus extending from the Gulf of\r\nMexico northward to the Arctic Ocean and bordered on the east by the\r\nAtlantic Mountains and on the west by a still greater series of\r\nmountains, which may be designated with sufficient accuracy as the\r\n_Continental Basin_.\r\n\r\n4. A group of mountain chains and mountain ranges on the west side of\r\nthe continent, including the Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada, Cascades,\r\netc., and sometimes termed the Cordilleras. Under the scheme of\r\nclassification here used, this highly complex belt of rugged country\r\nextending from south-central Mexico northward to the Arctic Ocean is\r\ntermed the _Pacific Cordillera_, or, in less technical language, the\r\n_Pacific Mountains_.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] The propriety of using the names here employed for the larger\r\nphysiographic provinces of North America has been discussed by several\r\nwriters in the _Bulletin of the Geographical Society of Philadelphia_,\r\nvol. ii, 1899, pp. 55-69.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--The larger physiographic divisions of North\r\nAmerica.]\r\n\r\nEach of the four physiographic provinces briefly described above is in a\r\nconspicuous manner elongated in a north and south direction. The\r\nmountains, valleys, and plateaus, as well as the controlling lines of\r\nstructure in the rocks below the surface, throughout the main body of\r\nthe continent coincide in direction more or less nearly with the\r\nparallels of longitude. At the south, however, and crossing the trend of\r\neach of the provinces named above, is the:\r\n\r\nFifth, or Caribbean province, which includes the West Indies, the\r\nsouthern part of Mexico, and all of Central America. In this\r\nprovince are the _Antillean Mountains_, now mostly submerged, the\r\nprincipal axes of which trend east and west.\r\n\r\nWith this brief outline of the larger physical divisions of North\r\nAmerica in mind, let us endeavour to become acquainted with the leading\r\ncharacteristics of each of the provinces as they exist to-day, and at\r\nthe same time learn something of their long and varied histories.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       COASTAL PLAINS AND PLATEAUS\r\n\r\n_The Coastal Plains._--From New York to Key West and thence about the\r\nborders of the Gulf of Mexico to the neighbourhood of Vera Cruz, the\r\nborder of the present land area of the continent is formed by a low\r\nplain, from 30 to 50 miles broad in New Jersey, but increasing in width\r\nsouthward to Georgia and Florida, where its somewhat indefinite inland\r\nmargin is more than 100 miles from the sea, and reaching its greatest\r\ndevelopment in the delta of the Mississippi. Extending southward about\r\nthe west coast of the Gulf, it forms the low, featureless eastern border\r\nof Texas, about 50 miles broad, and passes into Mexico, but gradually\r\nnarrows as the Pacific Mountains approach the coast, and ends in the\r\nvicinity of Vera Cruz.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic and Gulf coastal plain everywhere slopes gently seaward,\r\nand on its landward margin has an elevation in general of from 200 to\r\n300 feet. The character of the material of which the coastal plain is\r\ncomposed, the fossils contained in it, as well as its geographical\r\nfeatures, show that it is a continuation of the continental shelf, and\r\nwas formed at a time when the border of the continent was more deeply\r\nsubmerged than at present. Minor oscillations of the earth's crust have\r\ntime and again allowed the sea to extend inland, only to be forced to\r\nrecede when the land again rose. Each invasion of the sea left a sheet\r\nof soft sediment over the portion of the land that was submerged. These\r\noscillations are still in progress, as is indicated by the fact that\r\nalong the New Jersey coast a downward movement at the rate of about 2\r\nfeet per century is taking place. A similar depression of the land\r\nis also thought to be in progress along the south Atlantic coast and in\r\nthe delta of the Mississippi. The Atlantic coastal plain has its most\r\ncharacteristic development in South Carolina, and is roughly divisible\r\naccording to its topography and soil into several belts parallel with\r\nthe shore-line. At the same time it is transversely divided into strips\r\nby the several rivers which flow across it and by the many branches of\r\nthese rivers originating on the plain itself.\r\n\r\nThe junction of the portion of the gently sloping border of the\r\ncontinent now above sea-level, with the submerged portion, is\r\ncharacterized by the presence of a belt of swamps, in part marine\r\nmarshes where the salt water ebbs and flows, and in part fresh-water\r\nmorasses in which the drainage is obstructed largely by decaying\r\nvegetation. Inland from the coastal swamps the surface becomes higher,\r\nis for the most part well drained, and when not too sandy furnishes rich\r\nagricultural lands. The Atlantic plain as a whole thus has three\r\nprincipal divisions: a submerged portion, a marsh portion, and a\r\nsubaerial portion. During past ages the position of each of these belts\r\nmigrated, owing to movements in the earth's crust, but their succession\r\nin reference to each other has been the same since the Tertiary period.\r\n\r\nOne of the most typical portions of the fringe of swamps now bordering\r\nthe land is situated in eastern Virginia and North Carolina, and is\r\nknown as the Dismal Swamp. In the central portion of this marshy region,\r\nembracing some 700 square miles, lies Lake Drummond, an example of a\r\nlarge number of small fresh-water lakes which are retained by rims\r\ncomposed of plant growths and decaying vegetable matter. The mound of\r\nvegetable _debris_ in the summit of which Lake Drummond is situated is\r\nfrom 20 to 30 miles broad and rises some 12 feet above tide-level. The\r\nlake is nearly circular, from 2 to 21/2 miles in diameter, and from 6\r\nto 10 feet deep. The water is amber-coloured on account of the vegetable\r\nmatter in solution, but is clear and without sediment in suspension, and\r\nis considered as remarkably wholesome. The lake was without definite\r\noutlet previous to the cutting of drainage-canals, and is entirely\r\nencircled by a dense forest, which has encroached on its border in such\r\na manner as to render its boundaries indefinite. The wall of rank\r\nvegetation surrounding the open waters of the lake marks the beginning\r\nof the encircling swamp. Standing in the lake and supported by their\r\nwidely expanded roots are several aged cypress-trees.\r\n\r\nAlong the coast of the Carolinas and Georgia sand-bars thrown up by the\r\nsea have formed many lagoons (Fig. 6), which are being filled by the\r\nwash of detritus from the land, by sand blown from their confining\r\nridges, and by vegetation and the hard parts of molluscs, crustaceans,\r\netc., living in their waters. In part, these areas have been converted\r\ninto swamps, and are gradually being transformed into dry land. Farther\r\nsouthward, about the shores of Florida, and thence along the Gulf\r\nborder, the low, indefinite margin of the coastal plain is fringed in\r\nmany places by dense thickets of mangrove-trees, which extend their\r\naerial roots into the salt water, and by retaining sediment and dead\r\nvegetation as well as by furnishing conditions favourable for animal\r\nlife, lead to a gradual extension of the land.\r\n\r\nThe west border of the coastal plain from New York southward to central\r\nGeorgia is at the junction of the soft, unconsolidated sands and clays\r\nof the emerged portion of the continental shelf, with hard and usually\r\ncrystalline rocks of great geological age forming, an upland known as\r\nthe Piedmont plateau, which extends westward to the base of the\r\nAppalachian Mountains. The sharply defined boundary between the plain\r\nand the plateau is termed the _fall line_, for the reason that it is\r\nmarked by the lowest falls and rapids in the streams flowing eastward\r\nfrom the Appalachian Mountains. Throughout the courses of these streams\r\nto the west of the fall line they are shallow and swift and broken by\r\nmany picturesque rapids, while to the east of the fall line they broaden\r\nin the soft sediments of the coastal plain, and are deep, placid streams\r\nwhich widen into estuaries. The influence of the tides is felt in these\r\ndrowned rivers to the fall line. The most important fact in this\r\nconnection is that the lower courses of the larger rivers, such as\r\nthe Delaware, Susquehanna, Potomac, James, etc., are navigable for\r\nocean-going vessels, while their upper courses to the west of the fall\r\nline are difficult to traverse even in canoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Relief map of North America. After United\r\nStates Geological Survey and Canadian Geological Survey.]\r\n\r\nThe fall line is thus the head of navigation in a number of rivers, and\r\nfor this reason it has determined the sites of several important cities.\r\nIts course is marked by Trenton, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington,\r\nRichmond, Weldon, Raleigh, Augusta, and Macon. Farther south, about the\r\nlandward margin of the portion of the coastal plain bordering the Gulf\r\nof Mexico, the fall line is less distinct, largely for the reason that\r\nthe rocks bordering it on the north and west are less resistant than\r\nthose forming the plateau at the east base of the Appalachians.\r\n\r\nExceptions to the fact that the coastal plain is composed mostly of soft\r\nsediments occur in southern Florida and in Yucatan, where coral rock has\r\nbeen upraised. Southeastward from Yucatan a coastal plain is wanting and\r\nrocky bluffs separated by stream-cut valleys come boldly down to the\r\nsurf line. Partially drowned valleys on each side of Central America\r\nbear record of a recent but moderate downward movement of the land.\r\n\r\nFrom New York northward along the border of the continent the coastal\r\nplain is mostly lacking, or if recognisable, is greatly modified by\r\nglacial deposits, and the Piedmont plateau, as it is known farther\r\nsouth, swings eastward and becomes a coastal plateau with a more or less\r\nroughened surface, which extends northward to Labrador and the Arctic\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\nThe geologically recent oscillations of the continent, as stated in the\r\npreceding chapter, have been greatest in high latitudes, where the last\r\nmovement, as there are reasons for believing, was upward and is still\r\ncontinuing. This rise, although it has not fully counteracted the\r\nchanges produced by a preceding downward movement, has caused the\r\nshore-line to recede and a great area on the arctic border of the\r\ncontinent which was previously submerged has thus become exposed. The\r\ncoastal plain on the west side of Hudson Bay, as described by T. B.\r\nTyrrell, is about 50 miles wide in the vicinity of Fort Churchill,\r\nlatitude 55 deg., and broadens rapidly northward of that locality. In\r\nlatitude 64 deg. the boundary between these new lands and the older plains\r\nof the interior is about 300 miles from the present shore; thence\r\nnorthwestward it has not been traced, but may be expected to cross the\r\nMackenzie some 250 miles from its mouth and pass westward into Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis arctic coastal plain is known in part as the Barren Grounds, but in\r\ngeneral may be designated as a _tundra_, as over extensive areas it is\r\nsimilar to the still greater tundras of Siberia. This tundra forms the\r\nextreme northern and northwestern border of the continent in arctic\r\nCanada and northern and northwestern Alaska, and although but\r\nimperfectly explored, has a length of probably 2,000 miles and a width\r\nof from 50 to 60, and in places of over 100 miles. On the west coast of\r\nHudson Bay the tundra region slopes gradually from 500 to 600 feet above\r\nthe sea down to the present coast, and is traversed by sand and gravel\r\nterraces and beaches or ridges which mark the former positions of the\r\nsea margin. The lower ridges referred to are thickly strewn with shells\r\nof molluscs belonging to species still living in the adjacent ocean\r\nwaters, thus indicating the recency of the emergence of the land. This\r\narctic coastal plain has the same general geographical features as the\r\ncoast plain on the southern Atlantic and Gulf border of the continent;\r\nbut, owing mainly to different climatic conditions, differs from its\r\nsouthern representative in nearly every detail.\r\n\r\nThe tundra may be briefly defined as a vast frozen morass. The dense\r\nmat-like vegetation consists principally of mosses and lichens (but not\r\nnoticeably of _Sphagnum_ or peat-moss, as is sometimes stated), and\r\nduring the short and not infrequently hot summers is beautified by a\r\nmultitude of low flowering herbaceous plants. Trees are absent, except\r\nalong the inland border, where the tundra merges with the subarctic\r\nforest. To the north, or seaward from the isolated groves of stunted\r\nspruce-trees marking the \"continental timber-line,\" the only\r\nrepresentative of arboreal vegetation is usually the slim osier-like\r\narctic willow which grows in sheltered localities and attains a height\r\nof 3 to 5 feet. Near the streams there are in some localities broad\r\nareas covered with dark-green meadow-like growths of rushes\r\n(_Equiseta_). The luxuriant flowering plants spring into existence\r\nas if by magic as soon as the winter's snow melts, and under the warmth\r\nand light of the nightless arctic summer grow with wonderful rapidity.\r\nIn winter the tundra is snow-covered, but the snow is less deep than in\r\nmore humid regions, and the cold is intense. The bog becomes deeply\r\nfrozen, and is not completely thawed during the succeeding summer. Even\r\nin midsummer, when the surface is a luxuriant garden of flowers and\r\nfresh gray-green moss, ice exists a foot or two beneath the luxuriant\r\ncarpet and extends to a great but unknown depth. Excavations made in\r\nAlaska have shown that the perennial, dirt-stained ice beneath the\r\ntundra is at least 25 feet thick, but this is by no means its maximum\r\ndepth. On the shore of Eschscholtz Bay and along the Kowak River\r\nsections of the tundra exposed in cliffs indicate a thickness of 150 to\r\n300 feet of ice, covered by a thin layer of black peaty soil. The\r\nsimilar region in Siberia, as shown by borings, is known to be\r\npermanently frozen to a depth of 380 feet deep. The subsoil ice is\r\nsheltered by the vegetation and the peaty soil resting on it, from the\r\nheat of the short summers, and the part softened by the summer's sun is\r\nrefrozen during the long intensely cold winters. It is probable that\r\nunder the present climatic conditions a sheet of perennial ice would be\r\nformed beneath the tundra, but the suggestion that the ice now present\r\nis in part an inheritance from a former period of greater cold is not\r\nwithout support. The vegetation of the tundra grows each year at the\r\nsurface, while the partially decayed material below is frozen and\r\npreserved. This increase in depth of the vegetable matter is much the\r\nsame as the growth of peat in temperate latitudes, except that the\r\npartially decayed material is preserved in cold storage. It was in the\r\ntundra of Siberia that the completely preserved bodies of the mammoth\r\nand the woolly rhinoceros have been discovered. Similar finds are to be\r\nlooked for in the tundra of North America, where the bones of these\r\nanimals have already been found.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific border of the continent the shores are mostly bold, and\r\ncoastal plains comparable with those on its eastern and northern\r\nmargins are absent. In southern California, however, in the vicinity of\r\nLos Angeles, a modern and apparently local elevation of the land has\r\nproduced a highly fertile plain, now, owing to the magic touch of\r\nirrigation, beautified by gardens and orchards.\r\n\r\n_The Piedmont and Coastal Plateaus._--Adjacent to the western margin of\r\nthe Atlantic coastal plain, and extending from Alabama northward to New\r\nEngland, there is a plateau region about 150 miles broad in its central\r\npart, but narrowing towards its extremities so as to be from 40 to 60\r\nmiles broad in Maryland and New Jersey, and of about the same width at\r\nthe south, in Georgia. The slope of the plateau surface is seaward from\r\nan elevation of about 1,000 feet along its western margin to 250 or 300\r\nfeet at the fall line where it joins the coastal plain.\r\n\r\nFrom its position at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains this\r\nmoderately elevated plain is termed the Piedmont plateau. The same\r\nplateau extends northeastward, however, where it is known as the New\r\nEngland plateau, and is without any definite boundary to separate it\r\nfrom the similar region in the maritime provinces of Canada. While local\r\ndivisions of this great extent of moderately elevated plateau country\r\nare recognised, yet in a general view of the continent it is evident\r\nthat the Piedmont plateau, the New England plateau, and the similar\r\nregion, mostly of crystalline and igneous rocks, extending from Maine to\r\nHudson Strait and beyond, in reality forms a single great geographical\r\nunit in which the geological structure and geographical features are\r\nmuch the same. The general history of this great Atlantic plateau, as it\r\nmay, perhaps, be termed, shows that it consists mainly of metamorphic\r\nrocks, such as mica schist, gneiss, slates, etc., together with granite\r\nand other igneous rocks, and, to a minor extent, of sandstones, shales,\r\nand limestones, mostly of Jura-Trias and Carboniferous age. These rocks\r\nwere upraised probably in part into lofty mountains, and then worn down\r\nby erosion nearly to sea-level, thus forming what is termed a\r\n_peneplain_, or a plain of subaerial denudation. It is not intended by\r\nthis statement to imply that all of the Atlantic plateau was ever\r\na single great peneplain, but the same general history seems to apply to\r\nthe entire region. The upheaval of the plains produced by erosion gave\r\nthe streams greater energy, and they have begun the task of again\r\nreducing the land to sea-level, but have not as yet broadened their\r\nvalleys so as to greatly modify the general plateau character of the\r\nregion they traverse. The softer or more easily soluble rocks have been\r\neroded away, leaving broad valleys, as in the several instances where\r\nsandstones and shales of what is known as the Newark system (Jura-Trias)\r\noccur in detached areas from South Carolina to Nova Scotia. Then, too,\r\nfrom northern New Jersey northward to Labrador and beyond, great\r\nglaciers have crossed the plateau or developed upon its broad north\r\nportion and have ground down its surface or left widely extended hills\r\nand ridges of morainal material upon it.\r\n\r\nWhere the process, just referred to, of planing down a tract of country\r\nnearly to sea-level is incomplete and remnants of former uplands still\r\nremain as isolated hills or groups of hills, such inheritances from the\r\npre-peneplain stage may still exist when the region is elevated into a\r\nplateau and give diversity to its surface. An example of such a residual\r\nhill is furnished by Mount Monadnock, in southern New Hampshire, and, as\r\nproposed by W. M. Davis, the name of this old landmark is adopted as a\r\ntechnical term by which to designate all similar remnants of old uplands\r\nleft standing on a peneplain. On the Atlantic plateau there are many\r\n_monadnocks_. They range in size from well-characterized hills to\r\nmountain-like forms, and may be isolated or occur in groups. When a\r\nmonadnock stands alone its history may be easily read, but groups of\r\nsuch eminences, especially when of large size, become ranges of hills or\r\neven mountains, and may preserve so much of their former characteristics\r\nthat they outrank the adjacent peneplain and become the dominant\r\ngeographic feature of the region to which they give diversity. Such a\r\npassage from monadnocks to mountains seems to be furnished by the\r\nnumerous isolated hills on the Atlantic plateau and the mountains of New\r\nEngland and of eastern Canada.\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic portions of what has just been termed\r\nprovisionally the Atlantic plateau are the Piedmont plateau, which\r\nskirts the east base of the Appalachian Mountains from New York to\r\ncentral Alabama and the Labrador plateau. The eastern border of the\r\nPiedmont plateau is determined by the fall line described above, where\r\nthe hard crystalline rocks of the Piedmont region meet the softer rocks\r\nof the Atlantic coastal plain. The rivers flowing eastward from the\r\nAppalachian, such as the Delaware, Susquehanna, Potomac, and the James,\r\ncross the Piedmont plateau in well-defined but narrow channels, usually\r\nfrom 100 to 200 feet deep, leaving the interstream spaces with generally\r\nlevel surfaces, although etched as it were by the lateral tributaries of\r\nthe master streams. These rivers are shallow and rapid in their courses\r\nacross the plateau, or in somewhat technical geographical language are\r\nnot as yet graded, but on crossing the fall line become sluggish\r\ntide-water streams which widen into estuaries, as already described.\r\nOwing to the warm humid climate of this region, the rocks in the\r\ninterstream spaces are usually deeply decayed and furnish clay soils\r\nwhich have characteristic red and yellow colours. Much of the cotton and\r\ntobacco of the South Atlantic States is grown on these residual soils\r\nwhich were left as the more soluble portions of the rocks were removed\r\nin solution.\r\n\r\nLabrador, although in great part unexplored, is known to present the\r\ncharacteristic features of an irregular plateau, with a general\r\nelevation of 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the sea. The surface is\r\nundulating and has hills and hollows, the latter frequently holding\r\nlakes and swamps, but the inequalities seldom exceed 500 feet in\r\nvertical range. Although the western boundary of the Labrador plateau is\r\nindefinite, its area may be taken at about 500,000 square miles. In its\r\nwestern part, and apparently rising from the plateau as a group of\r\nresidual hills left by erosion, are the so-called Laurentian or\r\nLaurentide Mountains. The eastern border of the plateau forms the bold\r\nand excessively rugged Atlantic coast-line of Labrador, characterized by\r\nsteep cliff with a fringe of small rocky islands. The adjacent sea\r\nis deep and the continental shelf narrow. On the south the plateau is\r\nbordered by a series of terraces which lead down to the St. Lawrence\r\nRiver and on the west it merges indefinitely with the plains of the\r\ncontinental basin.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of Labrador are largely metamorphic, but include ancient\r\nigneous intrusions, and are hard and resistant. The present surface is\r\nthe result of deep erosion which has removed a great but unknown\r\nthickness of material and left exposed what was once the deeply buried\r\nbasal portion of a mountainous region. This is a part of the oldest\r\nknown land of the continent, and, so far as can be learned, has never\r\nbeen covered by the sea since a very ancient geological period. In\r\naddition to the long eras of erosion, during which the _debris_ removed\r\nwas deposited in part farther south, and contributed to the formation of\r\nthe stratified rocks of the Appalachian region and interior continental\r\nbasin, there was a comparatively recent extension of great glaciers over\r\nthe plateau which removed the previously disintegrated and decayed rocks\r\nand left the present bare, rounded, and generally subdued hills with\r\nintervening basins. The soils are thin, for the reason that under the\r\npresent climatic conditions rock decay is retarded, and are confined\r\nprincipally to the depression where peaty material has accumulated.\r\nOwing to the lack of soil on the uplands, the excess of water in the\r\nhollows, and to the severity of the climate, the forest is not\r\ncontinuous, the trees are small, and the vegetation generally of a\r\nsubarctic character. This vast region is without agricultural\r\npossibilities, and thus far has been of value to man almost solely on\r\naccount of its fur-bearing animals and the fisheries of its coast.\r\n\r\nThe northern border of the Atlantic plateau cannot at present be\r\naccurately defined. Seemingly it should include the Arctic archipelago,\r\nwhich provisionally may be considered as a deeply dissected plateau\r\nregion, at present less elevated than formerly, thus allowing the sea to\r\nenter the valleys and to transform old uplands into islands. The bold\r\nand highly instructive explorations conducted in recent years by\r\nRobert Bell, for the Canadian Geological Survey, have shown that in the\r\nregion adjacent to Hudson Strait the plateau features characteristic of\r\nthe greater part of the Labrador peninsula are absent and mountains\r\noccur which rank as the highest on the eastern border of the continent.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific coast plateaus corresponding closely with those adjacent\r\nto or bordering the Atlantic are wanting. What geographers recognise as\r\ndeeply dissected plateaus, so extremely rough that they pass for\r\nmountain ranges, do occur on the western border of the continent,\r\nhowever, and will be described later.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE ATLANTIC MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nThis title will no doubt appear novel to many persons, and is, perhaps,\r\nopen to adverse criticism, but it serves to unite in one group all of\r\nthe mountains in the eastern half of North America. A cordillera, as\r\nusually defined, consists of two or more mountain chains associated\r\ngeographically, but not necessarily of the same age. On the Atlantic\r\nborder of the continent we have an example of such a family of\r\nmountains. The Atlantic mountains, although comprising ranges, systems,\r\netc., of widely different ages, are all geologically old, and have\r\nresulted from upheavals along two generally parallel and slightly\r\noverlapping northeast and southwest belts adjacent to the Atlantic\r\nOcean. The growth of this group of mountains is believed to have been\r\nfrom the north southward, and several periods of upheaval have been\r\nrecognised.\r\n\r\nThe two main divisions or chains referred to are separated by the valley\r\nof the St. Lawrence. The mountains at the north are known as the\r\nLaurentides or Laurentian Highlands, and those at the south comprise the\r\nmountains of New Brunswick and Maine, the White Mountains of New\r\nHampshire, the Green Mountains of Vermont, the Adirondack Mountains of\r\nnortheastern New York, and the Appalachians. The most convenient method\r\nof reviewing the characteristics and histories of these several uplifts\r\nis to begin with the Appalachians, which are at the same time the\r\nmost important and best known, and consider them in their order from\r\nsouth to north.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Appalachian Mountains.]\r\n\r\n_The Appalachian Mountains._--This beautiful and frequently exceedingly\r\npicturesque series of long, narrow ridges separated one from another by\r\ntrough-like valleys, constitutes a mountain system some 900 miles long\r\nand 50 to 130 or more miles wide (Fig. 15). The truly mountainous\r\nportion in its widest part, in western North Carolina and eastern\r\nTennessee, is about 70 miles across, but a portion of the adjacent\r\nplateau on the west partakes of the same structural features and is a\r\npart of the Appalachian uplift. The system is considered as extending\r\nfrom the Hudson southward to central Alabama and central Georgia. At the\r\nnorth its terminus is indefinite, as it merges with the highlands to the\r\neast of the Hudson and with the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts, which\r\nin turn are not strictly separable from the Green Mountains of Vermont.\r\nAt the south, the system ends somewhat abruptly where the crystalline\r\nrocks comprising its southern terminus pass beneath the soft sediments\r\nof the coastal plain. The eastern border of the system is well defined\r\nby its junction with the Piedmont plateau, but on the west it merges\r\nthrough a series of lessening folds with the plateaus and plains of the\r\neastern border of the interior continental basin. The Alleghany plateau,\r\nwhich skirts the western border of what is usually recognised as the\r\nAppalachian Mountains, but which is really its moderately disturbed\r\nborder, extends from the Hudson to Alabama, and in its various portions\r\nis known by distinct names. Its northern extension overlooking the\r\nHudson forms the Catskill Mountains; farther south it becomes locally\r\nthe Alleghany plateau, and still farther south the Cumberland plateau.\r\nSeparating the bold eastern escarpment of this series of plateaus from\r\nthe generally higher mountains to the eastward lies the great\r\nAppalachian Valley, which under various names extends from the Hudson to\r\ncentral Alabama. This important and highly fruitful valley is underlaid\r\nto a great extent by thick bedded limestones and soft shales, and owes\r\nits existence to erosion and largely to the removal of limestone\r\nin solution.\r\n\r\nThe Appalachians are nowhere lofty, and only approach the\r\ncharacteristics of great mountains in their southern portion. The\r\nculminating summit is Mount Mitchell, in western North Carolina, which\r\nhas an elevation of 6,711 feet. Roan Mountain, 27 miles to the northward\r\nof Mount Mitchell, rises 6,287 feet above the sea. In the neighbouring\r\nUnaka and Great Smoky Mountains, to the southwest and west of Mount\r\nMitchell, there are many boldly rounded domes ranging in height from\r\n5,000 to over 6,000 feet Northward of the highly picturesque southern\r\nAppalachians, the system decreases in height and is really a deeply\r\ndissected plateau, as will be shown later, in which the long,\r\neven-crested ridges have a general elevation of 4,000 feet in Virginia\r\nand about 2,000 feet in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. At its northern\r\nextension in New York it decreases still more in height, and is\r\nsurpassed in elevation by the plateau on the west, there represented by\r\nthe Catskill Mountains, the highest portion of which is 3,660 feet above\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic structural feature of the Appalachians is the\r\npresence of a great series of up and down folds, or anticlinals and\r\nsynclinals as geologists term them, which run in a nearly parallel\r\nnortheast and southwest direction, but in Pennsylvania especially\r\nexhibit many broad curves in their general course. These folds are\r\nsimilar to the waves that may be produced in a heavy rug or carpet by\r\npressing against one of its margins. The rocks have been thrown into a\r\nseries of great wrinkles which are not continuous throughout the length\r\nof the system, but as one dies out another takes its place. The folds\r\noverlap at the ends or are arranged _en echelon_. The longer axes of the\r\nfolds are seldom horizontal, but have usually a gentle pitch; for this\r\nreason one end of a fold frequently passes beneath the surface, while\r\nthe other end is exposed to erosion. Another characteristic is that the\r\nanticlinals, as a rule, are steep on their western margins, and slope\r\nmore gently on their eastern flanks, or are unsymmetrical. The\r\noverturning of the folds where most pronounced has led to the\r\nbreaking of the rocks on the west side of an upward wrinkle where the\r\ndescending limb of an anticlinal is sharply bent in order to pass into\r\nthe ascending limb of the adjacent synclinal. These breaks or faults in\r\ncertain instances form thrust planes along which one portion of a series\r\nof beds has been carried westward, sometimes for several miles, over\r\nanother portion of the same series. This highly characteristic system of\r\nunsymmetrical folds, passing at times, and especially in Tennessee and\r\nAlabama, into great thrust planes, is accounted for on the general\r\ntheory that there has been lateral pressure or a tangential thrust,\r\nwhich has forced the strata into a series of elongated arches, in much\r\nthe same manner as in the case of a rug, as above suggested, one margin\r\nof which has been forced by lateral pressure towards its central part.\r\n\r\nThe rocks composing the greater portion of the Appalachians are\r\nstratified marine sediment such as sandstone, shale, limestone, etc.,\r\nwhich were laid down one on another until a great depth was attained,\r\ncorresponding, as we may fancy, to a pile of rugs, the original\r\nthickness in Pennsylvania being about 40,000 feet. Lateral pressure\r\nresulting, as it is believed, from the cooling and consequent\r\ncontraction of the earth's highly heated interior, and the movement of\r\nthe cool and rigid crust in order to keep in contact with the shrinking\r\nmass beneath, has led to the folding and occasional breaking of the\r\nrocks, which at the same time were elevated above the sea. A crushing\r\ntogether or folding of the rocks similar to that which has taken place\r\nalong the central part of the Atlantic border of North America, as is\r\nwell known, has occurred also in many other regions, and the\r\nAppalachians may be taken as the type of a class of mountains, sometimes\r\ntermed corrugated mountains, which includes the Alps and Pyrenees, the\r\nCoast Range of California, etc. For convenience we may speak of such\r\nmountains as being of the Appalachian type.\r\n\r\nHad the folding in the Appalachian region gone on without erosion, the\r\nsurface would to-day be a series of great, elongated arches or\r\nupward folds, rising in many instances 5,000 or more feet above the\r\nintervening valleys, and where breaks or faults occur their upraised\r\nborders would stand as mighty cliffs, in some localities a mile or more\r\nhigh. The central part of the region with this strange topography had\r\nthere been no erosion would, perhaps, be fully as prominent as the\r\nHimalayan Mountains are at present. No sooner, however, were the\r\nAppalachian Mountains upraised above the sea than the destructive\r\nagencies of the atmosphere began their attacks upon them. The rocks were\r\nshattered by changes of temperature, and at times at least crumbled by\r\nthe freezing of absorbed water and also underwent chemical changes which\r\nsoftened and disintegrated them. The rains beat upon them, and streams\r\nflowing to the sea cut channels and carried away the material forming\r\nthe land. These processes of disintegration and erosion have been in\r\nprogress since islands and continents first appeared on the earth, and\r\nevery mountain range now giving diversity to the surface of the land\r\nrepresents the net result of elevation over denudation. The Appalachians\r\nare not an exception, but a typical illustration of this general law.\r\nThe great folds of which they are composed have been truncated by\r\nerosion and the surfaces thus produced, etched, as it were, by the\r\naction of the air, rain, and by streams, so as to leave the edges of the\r\nmore resistant layers in relief.\r\n\r\nOne conspicuous result in this general process of erosion is due to the\r\nfact that the folded strata consist in many instances of alternating\r\nhard, or insoluble and soft, or readily soluble layers. Where resistant\r\nlayers underlaid by soft, or readily soluble strata formed the summits\r\nof arches they have in many instances been broken in the process of\r\nfolding or cut through by streams flowing down their flanks and the weak\r\nbeds beneath exposed. After this stage was reached the erosion of the\r\nupward folds went on more rapidly than the removal of rock from the\r\ncompressed downward folds, so that what is structurally a ridge became a\r\nvalley: while the bordering troughs or synclinals floored with hard\r\nlayers were left in relief as ridges or table-lands. The anticlinal\r\nridges have thus been transformed into topographic valleys and the\r\noriginal synclinal troughs left in relief as plateaus and ridges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Section of anticlinal valleys and synclinal\r\nmountains.]\r\n\r\nThis reversion of what would have been ridges and troughs had there been\r\nno erosion, is illustrated by the following cross-section through\r\nLookout Mountain in Alabama, which is an example of what is known as a\r\nsynclinal mountain. Many such synclinal mountains or plateaus, separated\r\nby narrower anticlinal valleys, occur throughout the Appalachians.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics in the present topography of the Appalachians just\r\nconsidered are but a minor portion of the great changes that have\r\nresulted from erosion. The history of the system has not been the same\r\nin this connection throughout, but retains evidences of successive\r\nupward movements with long periods of erosion intervening which have\r\nproduced certain striking differences in its northern and southern\r\nportions. These differences are so well marked that it is convenient to\r\ndivide the system into two portions, termed the northern Appalachians\r\nand southern Appalachians. The most conspicuous difference between the\r\ntwo is shown by the direction of flow of the larger rivers. At the\r\nnorth, the principal rivers--the Delaware, Susquehanna, Potomac, and\r\nJames--rise well to the west of the mountains and flow southeast athwart\r\nthe numerous folds, and after crossing the Piedmont plateau and coastal\r\nplain discharge into the Atlantic. At the south, however, the rivers,\r\nparticularly New River and the Tennessee, rise on the eastern border of\r\nthe Appalachians and flow westward, cutting through the Alleghany\r\nplateau, and are tributary to the Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico.\r\nThe somewhat arbitrary dividing line between these two provinces\r\nfollows the divide to the north of New River, or in a general way, as\r\nhas been stated by C. W. Hayes, is marked by a line drawn from the most\r\neasterly point of Kentucky southeastward to Cape Fear, on the Atlantic\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nThe fact that several large rivers rising to the northwest of the\r\nnorthern Appalachians flow directly across or through the numerous\r\nridges composing the system in deep, narrow valleys, and the similar\r\nbehaviour of the streams rising on the eastern border of the southern\r\nAppalachians, but flowing westward, are among the most interesting\r\nfeatures of the entire region. Why is it that the mountains have not\r\nformed a divide or water-parting so as to force all of the streams\r\nhaving their sources on its west side to take what would seem the easier\r\ncourse, and to flow to the Gulf of Mexico, and cause the waters falling\r\non its eastern slopes to flow to the Atlantic? The answer to this\r\napparently puzzling question has been furnished by Davis, Willis, Hayes,\r\nCampbell, and others, who have shown that the mountains were not raised\r\nall at once, but experienced upward movements at widely separated\r\nintervals, with intervening periods of rest during which the elevations\r\npreviously produced were more or less completely planed away by erosion.\r\nDuring one of these intervals the north Appalachians more especially\r\nwere worn down to approximately sea-level and a gently sloping plain\r\nproduced across which the larger rivers flowed to the Atlantic. This\r\npeneplain was later upraised into a plateau and its downward inclination\r\ntowards the east increased. The streams were thus given greater energy\r\nand began again to deepen their channels. They held their right of way\r\nacquired on the featureless erosion plain and cut deep trenches through\r\nthe edges of the hard layers which crossed their courses. At the same\r\ntime lateral branches were developed which followed the outcrops of the\r\nless resistant beds and eroded them away so as to leave the hard beds in\r\nbold relief. As the edges of the more resistant beds became more and\r\nmore prominent the eastward-flowing streams cut deeper and deeper into\r\nthem. The even summits of the ridges, one of the most striking\r\nfeatures in the beautiful scenery of the Appalachians, still mark the\r\nposition of the elevated erosion plain.\r\n\r\nIn the southern Appalachian the old erosion plain formed nearly at\r\nsea-level was tilted gently westward, and the streams flowing over its\r\nsurface given initial courses in that direction, which were maintained\r\nas they deepened their channels, and on account of increased energy\r\noriginating from the upraising of the region drained by them, developed\r\nlateral branches, as is the case of the more northern streams just\r\nreferred to, and the process of carving away the land to sea-level was\r\nagain renewed.\r\n\r\nPortions of the original upland or mountain mass left unconsumed during\r\nthe long period of planation, which reduced most of the region nearly to\r\nsea-level, still remain in eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina,\r\nand northern Georgia, and form the highest and most picturesque portion\r\nof the Appalachians.\r\n\r\nAfter the upraised peneplain from which the long, even-crested ridges of\r\nthe Appalachians were produced by the excavation of the bordering\r\nvalleys had been deeply dissected and the valleys broadened, another\r\nupward movement took place and the streams again deepened their valleys.\r\nThis is the stage in which we now find the mountains. The crests of the\r\nridges, characteristically displayed in eastern Pennsylvania, are\r\nportions of the first peneplain of which a definite record is preserved,\r\nwhile the broad valleys with sharply cut channels in their bottoms\r\nrepresent the much less complete second stage of planation.\r\n\r\nThe two ancient peneplains referred to above, the histories of which are\r\nrecorded in the topography, have received definite names in order that\r\nthey may be readily designated. The older and higher one is termed the\r\nSchooley peneplain[2] on account of the preservation of a typical\r\nportion at Schooley Mountain in New Jersey, while the lower one,\r\nrepresented by the broad valley through which flows the Shenandoah\r\nRiver, Virginia, is known as the Shenandoah peneplain. A generalized\r\nprofile in a northwest and southeast direction through a portion of the\r\nAppalachians is shown in the following diagram, which will serve to make\r\nmore definite the description just given. The highest summits in the\r\ndiagram represent portions of the Schooley peneplain; if the depressions\r\ncould be refilled the surface of the great plateau formed by the\r\nelevation of this plain would be restored. The bottoms of the broad\r\ndepressions represent the Shenandoah peneplain, which is sharply\r\ntrenched by the modern river channels.\r\n\r\n[2] Also known as the \"Kittatinny peneplain,\" but the name used above\r\nhas priority.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Generalized east-and-west profile showing\r\nrelation of peneplains.]\r\n\r\nThe Appalachians thus furnish not only a typical example of a mountain\r\nsystem produced by the folding and upheaval of the rocks of the earth's\r\ncrust, accompanied in many localities by breaks or faults and\r\noverthrusts, but also preserve the records of two well-characterized\r\npeneplains. The long and varied history of the range has been in part\r\ninterpreted by geologists from the character of the rocks, the fossils\r\nthey contain, and the structure that has been impressed upon them; but\r\nsome of the most instructive chapters are recorded in the topography,\r\nand their study has led to a highly creditable advance in methods of\r\ngeographical research.\r\n\r\nThe Appalachian Mountains when first seen by Europeans were clothed\r\nthroughout with a varied and beautiful forest consisting largely of\r\nhardwood trees. Nowhere do they invade the region of perpetual snow, and\r\nglaciers are absent. These statements are true also for all of the\r\nmountains on the eastern side of the continent to the south of Hudson\r\nStrait.\r\n\r\nThe Appalachians abound in beautiful scenery, but, except about a few of\r\nthe very highest domes and ridges, have little of the stern\r\nruggedness which is typical of truly great mountains. Their countless\r\nvalleys are now mostly cleared of their primitive forests and under\r\ncultivation. To a large extent also even the steep hillsides are tilled.\r\nThe larger trees which formerly grew on the mountains have nearly all\r\nbeen felled, and where the land is not suitable for cultivation their\r\nplace is taken by a dense second growth. Under the mild, humid climate\r\nthat prevails, more especially from the vicinity of the Susquehanna\r\nRiver southward, the rocks are deeply disintegrated and decayed, and\r\neven steep mountainsides are mantled with soil and rock _debris_. It is\r\nthe excess of disintegration and decay over erosion which gives to the\r\nmountains their usually flowing outlines and pleasingly picturesque\r\nrather than rugged scenery. The valleys still retain much of the\r\nmaterial washed from the uplands, and are deeply floored with rich soil.\r\nThe characteristic colours of this decayed rock-waste are many shades of\r\nred and yellow, which harmonize in a most artistic manner with the\r\nprevailing green of the plant-covered uplands and abandoned fields.\r\nThese red and yellow soils, particularly about the bases of the higher\r\nsummits of the southern Appalachians, afford abundant crops of cotton,\r\ncorn (maize), and tobacco.\r\n\r\n_The Mountains of New England, New York, New Brunswick, etc._--The\r\npicturesque Berkshire Hills, in the western portion of Massachusetts,\r\nhave rounded and flowing outlines and a generally subdued relief. The\r\nmore prominent of these greatly eroded remnants of what was once a\r\nmountain range rise but 2,000 to 3,500 feet above the sea. No\r\nsatisfactory boundary between these hills of gneiss, schist, and allied\r\nmetamorphic rocks, and the others of the same general character in the\r\nneighbouring portions of New York and New Jersey, has been determined.\r\nSo far as the relief is concerned, and so far also as the complex\r\ngeological history has been deciphered, there seems no good reason for\r\nseparating the Berkshire Hills from the Appalachian Mountains. It is\r\nconvenient, however, to consider the Appalachians as terminating at the\r\nHudson. The Berkshire Hills when traced northward merge with a\r\nregion of similar topography which unites them with the Green Mountains\r\nof Vermont, the highest summit of which, Mount Mansfield, attains an\r\nelevation of 4,364 feet above the sea. To the east of the Green\r\nMountains are situated the still higher and more rugged White Mountains\r\nof New Hampshire, which culminate in Mount Washington. This widely known\r\nand greatly admired peak has an elevation of 6,293 feet, and, next to\r\nMount Mitchell in the southern Appalachians, is the highest mountain on\r\nthe eastern side of the continent to the south of the newly discovered\r\ngroup of peaks near Hudson Strait. Associated with Mount Washington are\r\nat least 15 peaks, each of which is over 5,000 feet high, and a still\r\nlarger number of lesser summits which exceed 4,000 feet in elevation\r\nabove the sea. The remarkable natural beauties of the Green and White\r\nMountains, the ease with which they can be reached by means of\r\nrailroads, and the numerous summer hotels, and hospitable farmhouses\r\ninterspersed among them, make this, the most mountainous portion of New\r\nEngland, a favourite region for summer rest and recreation. The Green\r\nand White Mountains are nearly parallel north and south ranges, from 30\r\nto 60 miles apart, and separated by a tract of lower but hilly country\r\nwith a generally southern slope, where many streams unite to form the\r\nsouthward-flowing Connecticut River.\r\n\r\nThe Adirondack Mountains, in northeastern New York, are situated some 25\r\nmiles to the west of the Green Mountains, and separated from them by\r\nanother tract of hilly country similar to the one dividing the mountains\r\nof Vermont from those of New Hampshire. In this space lies the irregular\r\nsheet of water over 100 miles long known as Lake Champlain. This\r\nbeautiful lake discharges northward through Richelieu River to the St.\r\nLawrence. In the same tract of hills, but to the southward of Lake\r\nChamplain and tributary to it, lies the smaller but still more charming\r\nLake George.\r\n\r\nThe Adirondacks are rudely circular in ground plan, and measure from 60\r\nto 70 miles from east to west, and about 100 miles from north to south.\r\nThe entire area, known to the early settlers of New York State as\r\nthe North Woods, is rugged and most pleasingly diversified. Its leading\r\ncharms are the large number of dark, densely forested summits, the many\r\nbeautiful lakes and clear, sparkling streams. The highest of the\r\nnumerous steep-sided peaks is Mount Marcy, 5,344 feet, and second in\r\nrank is the equally beautiful eminence known as Whiteface, which rises\r\n4,872 feet above the sea and about 3,000 feet above the adjacent\r\nvalleys. Over 20 neighbouring forest-covered summits have elevations in\r\nexcess of 4,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe rugged region in northeastern New York and the adjacent portion of\r\nNew England is in general without well-marked boundaries. On the north\r\nit extends into Canada, and is margined by the great valley through\r\nwhich flows the St. Lawrence. In the province of Ottawa, to the south of\r\nthe St. Lawrence, there is a group of bold hills similar in many ways to\r\nthe Green Mountains, known as the Notre Dame Mountains, which decreases\r\nin height when traced northward and merge with a roughened plateau which\r\nextends far to the northeast and embraces the Gaspe Peninsula and the\r\ntable-land and hills of New Brunswick. Much of the country adjacent to\r\nthe St. Lawrence on the south is rolling and hilly and contains large\r\ntracts of rich agricultural land which is highly favourable for dairying\r\nand sheep-raising. Mount Sutton, the highest elevation in the Notre Dame\r\nMountains, is 4,000 feet high, and several other forest-covered\r\nmountain-like hills range in elevation from 1,000 to 3,000 feet. In the\r\nirregular valleys of this region there are a large number of lakes,\r\nsituated in general from 700 to 1,000 feet above the sea. The Gaspe\r\nPeninsula to the north of New Brunswick, bordered on the north by the\r\nvalley of the St. Lawrence, and on the east by the Gulf of St. Lawrence,\r\nhas a rough relief and dense forests and is still a wilderness. The\r\ngeneral elevation of the uplands in this little known region is about\r\n1,500 feet. The surface is in reality a broad plateau in which numerous\r\nvalleys have been excavated and from which rises a range of hills termed\r\nthe Shikshock Mountains, some 65 miles long and 4 or 5 miles wide,\r\nwith peaks ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 feet in height.\r\n\r\nMuch of Maine and New Brunswick is similar to the region just referred\r\nto, and, in a generalized geographical view, may be considered as a part\r\nof the great coastal plateau of the northeastern portion of the\r\ncontinent, roughened by erosion so as to appear to one travelling\r\nthrough its valleys as an endless succession of rugged hills. The\r\nhighest of the numerous prominences in Maine is Mount Katahdin, 5,200\r\nfeet, and in New Brunswick the culminating summit is Bald Mountain,\r\n2,470 feet.\r\n\r\nThe rugged region embracing the Adirondacks, together with the more\r\nelevated portions of New England and of the adjacent provinces of\r\nCanada, has many geographical features that are similar to those of the\r\nsouthern Appalachians, but at the same time this, the central portion,\r\ndiffers in a marked way from the southern extension of the Atlantic\r\nmountains. The higher mountains in each of these picturesque regions are\r\nat least in a general way to be considered as the unconsumed remnants of\r\nancient uplands, the greater part of which have been eroded away. The\r\nmost marked contrast in the scenery of these two regions of similar\r\nelevation is due to the presence of a great number of lakes at the\r\nnorth, many of them of large size, and the total absence of such\r\nbeautifying elements in the landscapes at the south. The streams at the\r\nnorth are frequently impetuous and broken by many cataracts and rapids,\r\nthus furnishing abundant water-power; while at the south the streams\r\nflow through more evenly graded channels and are without cascades except\r\nnear their sources in the mountains. These contrasts are such as are to\r\nbe found the world over between regions of young and old topography. The\r\ndifferences in the degree of development reached by the streams of the\r\nNew England region as contrasted with those of the southern\r\nAppalachians, finds an explanation in the fact that New England, Canada,\r\netc., was formerly covered with glacial ice, and on the retreat of the\r\nglaciers the surface of the land was left with an essentially new\r\nrelief, while the southern Appalachians were well to the south of\r\nthe great ice invasion, and the streams of that region have reached a\r\nmature development, except near the sources of their head-water\r\nbranches, which, like the topmost twigs of a tree, are always young.\r\n\r\nThe central, like the southern portion of the Atlantic mountains, is\r\nforest-clothed. All but a few of the highest summits in the Adirondack\r\nand White Mountains are concealed beneath a dense and varied growth of\r\ntrees and shrubs. The summits, which are nearly bare of vegetation, like\r\nthe upper 800 or 1,000 feet of Mount Washington, owe this condition to\r\nlack of soil rather than to elevation. Nowhere in the Atlantic mountains\r\nto the south of the but little known peaks near Hudson Strait, is the\r\nelevation sufficient to reach above what would be the timber-line under\r\nfavourable soil conditions. The trees of the White and neighbouring\r\nmountains are principally various species of conifers, such as the pine,\r\nspruce, hemlock, larch, etc., which grow thickly on all but the most\r\nprecipitous slopes. Before man disfigured the beauties of the land the\r\nlower hills, the river-valleys, and the borders of the numerous lakes\r\nand tarns were clothed with a more varied flora than the uplands. In\r\nthese valley forests the dark foliage of evergreens is in summer mingled\r\nwith the lighter green of maples, beeches, birches, oaks, locusts, and\r\nother broad-leaf trees. The forests are thus highly diversified and\r\npartake of the characteristics of both the northern and southern floras.\r\nIt is in these northern woods that the glorious autumnal colouring for\r\nwhich North America is justly famous is to be seen in its greatest\r\nsplendour. October is here truly the golden month of the year. At that\r\nseason the bold hills, with their sombre robes of coniferous trees, rise\r\nlike dark rugged islands above an undulating sea from which the most\r\ngorgeous sunset colours seem to be reflected. The brilliant colouring of\r\nthe ripe foliage beautifies the land as with a cloth of gold. It is at\r\nthis season also, during the tranquil days of what is known as Indian\r\nSummer, that a purple haze is thrown like a veil over the harlequin\r\nlandscape, as if to subdue its glories and bring them within the range\r\nof man's appreciation.\r\n\r\nOnly a few of the higher summits in the New England region approach the\r\nscenic conditions usually associated with truly lofty mountains. In\r\nfact, the general lack of rugged escarpments as well as of great\r\nelevation leads the geographer to rank even the highest of these rounded\r\nsummits as hills of large size rather than attempt to burden them with\r\nthe dignity that the term mountain carries with it. They are beautiful\r\nhills, separated one from another by lovely valleys, which draw the\r\nbeholder to them and fill his memory with tender longings and vague\r\ndreamy fancies such as the sterner grandeurs of great mountains fail to\r\nawaken.\r\n\r\n_The Laurentian Highlands._--A vast area in the eastern portion of\r\nCanada, to the north of the valley of the St. Lawrence, including\r\nLabrador, is underlaid by very ancient crystalline rocks of the same\r\ngeneral character as those forming the Adirondacks. This same geological\r\nsystem, the Archean, has a wide development in the continental basin to\r\nthe north of Lake Superior and about Hudson Bay. To the north of Quebec,\r\nin the region drained by the Saguenay and Ottawa Rivers, the land has a\r\ngeneral elevation of 1,500 to 1,600 feet, and is known as the Laurentian\r\nHighlands, although sometimes dignified by the name Laurentian\r\nMountains, or, more briefly, as the Laurentides. In reality, this broad,\r\nindefinitely defined region from a geographical point of view is a\r\nroughened plateau and not a mountain range or group of ranges. When the\r\nstructure and metamorphosed condition of the rocks are considered,\r\nhowever, it is found that they have the characteristics pertaining to\r\nthe central and more deeply seated portions of true mountains. The rocks\r\nare mainly crystalline schist, gneiss, granite, etc., together with\r\nigneous intrusions, all of which have been intensely folded, crumpled,\r\nand broken. The general interpretation of the existing conditions is\r\nthat deep erosion has occurred and, in fact, a mountain range or a\r\nmountain chain worn down to a generally plane surface. The thickness of\r\nthe rocks thus removed, or the depth of erosion, is unknown, and owing\r\nmainly to the complexity of the geological structure of the terranes\r\nremaining, will perhaps never be ascertained, but can be safely\r\nestimated as not only hundreds, but several thousands of feet. Erosion\r\nhas laid bare portions of the earth's crust which were once deeply\r\nburied, and reveals the character of the \"basement complex,\" as it has\r\nbeen termed, which forms the foundation of the continent. Owing to the\r\ngreat age of the rocks and the depth to which they were once depressed\r\nin the earth's crust, they have experienced great changes. They are not\r\nonly intensely folded and crushed, but in large part have been caused to\r\nflow under great pressure, and have thus acquired a schistose structure.\r\nFissures have been filled with molten rock injected from below so as to\r\nform dikes, and possibly still greater or regional intrusions have\r\noccurred. Over large areas the amount of once molten and intruded rock\r\nexceeds the surface exposure of what are usually, but with some\r\nhesitation, classed as metamorphosed sediments.\r\n\r\nLong exposure to the air in a region of mild relief is usually\r\naccompanied by the formation of a deep soil. The soil over the\r\nLaurentian Highlands, however, is generally thin, and large areas of\r\nbare rock are exposed. The explanation of this apparent anomaly is that\r\nglaciers during a geologically recent period were formed on this region\r\nand flowed away from it, carrying most of the previously formed rock\r\n_debris_ with them. The time since the melting of the glaciers has been\r\ntoo short for a new soil to form, except in the valleys and depressions\r\namong the bare glaciated hills, which hold a peaty accumulation\r\nresulting from the partial decay of vegetation. The scarcity of soil is\r\nalso due in part to the climatic conditions now prevailing, which are\r\nunfavourable to rapid rock decay.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the Laurentian Highlands and in the vicinity of Hudson\r\nStrait, the land becomes higher, and as recently reported by Robert\r\nBell, of the Canadian Geological Survey, forms true mountains with\r\nelevations in the neighbourhood of 8,000 feet. What revelations are to\r\ncome from the inhospitable and in large part ice-covered lands still\r\nfarther north can only be told as exploration and surveys are extended\r\nin that direction.\r\n\r\nThis brief review of some of the leading characteristics of the\r\nmountains and hills adjacent to the Atlantic coast will, I think, serve\r\nto show that they bear a family relationship; like the members of a\r\nfamily, they are of various ages, although all of them are past their\r\nprime, and may with propriety be termed the _Atlantic Cordillera_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE CONTINENTAL BASIN\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the map forming Fig. 14, on which the larger\r\ngeographical features of North America are indicated, will assist the\r\nreader in appreciating the general relations and extent of the plains\r\nand plateaus which collectively form the Continental basin.\r\n\r\nThis medial region of the continent is bordered on the east for some\r\n2,000 miles by the Atlantic mountains, and on the west throughout its\r\nentire extent by the Pacific mountains. It is open to the sea at both\r\nthe north and the south, and extends in one continuous series of plains\r\nand plateaus from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. The southern\r\nportion of this interior basin or trough has already been briefly\r\ndescribed in discussing the characteristics of the Gulf plains. The\r\nnorthern portion has also been considered in describing the tundra\r\nregion adjacent to the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe leading geographical features of the North American continental\r\nbasin are its generally low elevation, the mildness of its topographic\r\ndetails, and, with two exceptions, the absence within its borders of\r\nelevations having a mountainous structure. In general the rocks beneath\r\nthe surface are horizontally stratified marine sediments. The stream-cut\r\nvalleys are shallow and usually broad, except in the bordering plateaus\r\nand foot-hills on the east and west sides, where the streams frequently\r\nflow several hundred feet below the surface of the broad, flat-topped\r\ninterstream spaces. The drainage of the continental basin serves as a\r\nconvenient basis for subdividing it into three separate portions. These\r\nare the Gulf slope, which discharges its surplus waters into the Gulf of\r\nMexico and is drained principally by the Mississippi; the St.\r\nLawrence slope, occupied in part by the Great Lakes and drained by the\r\nSt. Lawrence River; and the arctic slope, down which the Mackenzie,\r\nNelson, and other rivers flow to the Arctic Ocean or to Hudson Bay. At\r\nno place are the Pacific mountains broken by cross-drainage, so as to\r\nallow the continental basin to send a tribute to the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe vast extent of the Continental basin, embracing, as it does, some\r\nthree-fourths of the entire area of North America, makes it necessary,\r\neven in a general review of the large geographical features of the\r\ncontinent, to recognise smaller subdivisions than the three great\r\ndrainage slopes referred to above. For this purpose we select the more\r\nor less well-defined plains and plateaus into which the region is\r\nnaturally subdivided. The portion of the Continental basin embraced\r\nwithin the boundaries of the United States has been shown by J. W.\r\nPowell to consist of the following physiographic regions, namely, the\r\nGulf plains; the Prairie plains; the Lake plains, including the region\r\ndraining to the Great Lakes; and the Great plateaus or Great plains, as\r\nthey are more generally termed, adjacent to the eastern border of the\r\nPacific mountains. Several of these divisions need to be extended and\r\nstill others recognised in order to include the entire region under\r\nreview. The portion of the Continental basin to the north of the United\r\nStates-Canadian boundary has been only partially explored, and the\r\nsubdivisions of it suggested below are to be considered as provisional.\r\n\r\nThe Lake plains include in Canada the country to the north of the Great\r\nLakes, which drains to them, but excepting the flat lands bordering\r\nLakes Erie and Ontario and once covered by their waters, the region\r\nreferred to is rather a roughened plateau than a plain. From a\r\ngeological point of view the hilly country composed of crystalline rocks\r\nto the north of Lakes Superior and Huron and included within their\r\nhydrographic basins partakes more of the character of the Laurentian\r\nHighlands than it does of the features of the portion of the Lake plains\r\nsituated in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Prairie plains also extend far to the north of the international\r\nboundary, and on their northern border merge with the forest-covered\r\nplains in central Manitoba and the northern portion of Saskatchewan,\r\nwhich are drained by northward-flowing rivers. These plains in the far\r\nnorth differ from the Prairie plains in the fact that they are forested\r\nand acquire greater diversity from the presence of innumerable lakes,\r\nseveral of which are of large size. For convenience we may designate\r\nthis vast and but little known northern region as the Subarctic Forest\r\nplains. Still farther north, where the forest dies away, lie the Barren\r\nGrounds, which merge on their northern border with the frozen morasses\r\nor tundra of the arctic coastal plain.\r\n\r\nTo acquire just conceptions of the topographic and other characteristics\r\nof the several regions of mild relief which make up the Continental\r\nbasin is a difficult task, as each one is of great extent and possesses\r\nmany peculiarities of its own, and besides, in two separate regions,\r\neach embracing many hundreds of square miles, movements in the earth's\r\ncrust have occurred of such a nature as to elevate the rocks and give\r\nthem the general structure commonly found in mountain ranges. Reference\r\nis here made to the Ozark uplift in the southwestern portion of the\r\nPrairie plains and the Black Hills of Dakota which rise from the Great\r\nplateaus.\r\n\r\n_The Ozark Uplift._--There is an area embracing about 75,000 square\r\nmiles in southern Missouri, northern Arkansas, and the eastern border of\r\nthe Indian Territory, in which the rocks have been upraised above the\r\nsurrounding Gulf and Prairie plains. The uplift, if we imagine it\r\nuneroded, would have the general form of an inverted canoe; that is, it\r\nwould form an elongated ridge, broad and dome-like in the central\r\nportion and dying away on all sides into the great surrounding region of\r\nundisturbed and essentially horizontal rocks. The major axis of the\r\nuplift, although exhibiting a double curvature, has a general northeast\r\nand southwest trend. It is about 500 miles long, and in the widest part\r\nis approximately 200 miles broad. What the height of the dome\r\nwould be had the rocks composing it not yielded to the destructive\r\ninfluences of the air or been removed by streams cannot be readily\r\nestimated, since the movements of the earth's crust which upraised it\r\noccurred at several widely separated intervals with intervening periods\r\nof decay and erosion, and downward movements have also been experienced\r\nwhich submerged the region and permitted the deposit of sheets of\r\nsediment over it. If the results of the upbuilding agencies had not in a\r\nlarge measure been counteracted in these several ways, the dome to-day\r\nwould have a height of several thousand feet. In the present condition\r\nthe deeply eroded dome presents the net result of elevation over\r\nsubsidence and erosion. The dome-like form is lost, and in its place is\r\na complex series of ridges and valleys. The higher summits now\r\nremaining, situated principally in the Iron Mountain district in\r\nnortheastern Missouri, rise from 1,400 to 1,800 feet above the\r\nneighbouring plains, and from 1,800 to 2,100 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nThe greater intensity with which the rocks in the southwestern portion\r\nof the Ozark uplift have been folded than in the more northern portion\r\nand the varying degrees to which the beds have yielded to denudation\r\nhave resulted in giving to its various parts different types of\r\ntopography. This diversity has led to the recognition of several\r\ndistinct divisions, such as the Shawnee Hills, at the extreme\r\nnortheastern end of the uplift, where the rocks have been folded and the\r\nridges cut across by the Mississippi; the St. Francois Mountains, in\r\nsoutheastern Missouri, composed of a large number of isolated hills and\r\nrising from 500 to 800 feet above the adjacent valleys; the Ozark\r\nplateau, in southwestern Missouri and northwestern Arkansas, the central\r\npart of which has a general elevation of 1,500 feet above the sea, and\r\nto one travelling over it seems a boundless and featureless plain\r\nunderlaid by apparently horizontal but in reality gently westward\r\ndipping sheets of stratified rocks; the Boston Mountains, in central and\r\nwestern Arkansas, consisting of rugged irregular ridges and truncated\r\nsummits with a general crest-line elevation of 1,000 feet above\r\nthe sea; and the Ouachita (pronounced _Wichitaw_) Mountains, formed of\r\nnumerous rudely parallel upward folds of hard rock, which rise from 500\r\nto 1,000 feet above the adjacent valleys and form a belt of unusually\r\npicturesque, forest-crowned hills, extending from Little Rock, Arkansas,\r\nwestward into Indian Territory.\r\n\r\nThe study of the island-like Ozark region in the broad, ocean-like\r\nexpanse of the prairies is far from being complete. Although\r\ntopographically distinct and appearing as one of the minor units in the\r\ngeology of the continent, geologists are inclined to the view that the\r\nOzark uplift as above described should be considered as consisting of\r\ntwo independent but contiguous areas of upheaval, namely, the Ozark\r\nHills, situated mainly in Missouri, and the Ouachita Hills, lying mainly\r\nin Arkansas and the Indian Territory. This Ozark-Ouachita region--by\r\nwhatever name finally designated--is one with a long and varied, nay,\r\neven a poetic history. In writing of the Archean rocks of the Iron\r\nMountain region, Missouri, Arthur Winslow states that they \"are truly\r\nancient elevations, older than any others in the State, older than the\r\nmountains of Arkansas, older than the Appalachians, older than the Rocky\r\nMountains; if venerable be an attribute of great age, they certainly\r\nmerit that appellation. For not only are all other rocks of Missouri\r\nyouthful as compared with these, but there is a genetic relationship,\r\nand the former are in a sense descendants of the latter. For when the\r\nlimestones and other sedimentary rocks were yet unformed these\r\ncrystalline rocks must have existed as parts of a continental mass, and\r\nfrom the degradation of this continent resulted the materials of the\r\nlater formed sedimentary rocks. The present granite and porphyry hills\r\nare but protruding parts of the remnant of this ancient continent which\r\nstood as islands above the ocean waters while the beds of limestone and\r\nsandstone were being formed about them, which rose with these beds when\r\nthey were lifted from the waters, which now, rugged and weather-beaten,\r\nyet tempered by age and varied experience, rear themselves above the\r\nsurrounding younger rocks and bid fair still to live when the\r\nlatter have yielded to the forces of degradation.\"\r\n\r\nBesides its pleasing scenery, varied and abundant mineral resources, and\r\nhealth-giving springs, this oasis of hills amid the unvaried monotony of\r\nthe grass-covered plains in the southern portion of the continental\r\nbasin derives an additional attraction from its forest growths in which\r\nsouthern pines are mingled with oaks, hickories, walnuts, and other\r\nbroad-leaved trees. The soil is generally productive, and great fields\r\nof corn and cotton may be seen side by side.\r\n\r\n_The Gulf Plains._--The Gulf plains include the western portion of\r\nFlorida, and extend westward and southward about the borders of the Gulf\r\nof Mexico in a continuous belt from 50 to 60 to perhaps 100 miles wide,\r\nto where the Pacific mountains approach the coast in east-central\r\nMexico. This low, gently seaward-sloping region, underlaid by soft\r\nhorizontal strata, possesses a generally rich soil well adapted for the\r\ncultivation of cotton, corn, sugar-cane, and rice. In the low, hot\r\ncountry of eastern Mexico nearly all tropical fruits can be successfully\r\nraised. The most characteristic as well as the broadest portion of this\r\nproductive belt is in the States of Mississippi and Louisiana, and\r\nextends northward with a gradually decreasing width to the mouth of the\r\nOhio. This is the lower Mississippi basin, which owes its existence\r\nmainly to the deposits of silt laid down by the river after which it is\r\nnamed. Much of the land is really the delta of the \"Father of Waters,\"\r\nover which that river spreads out in vast inundations each year.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf plains skirt the southern end of the Appalachian Mountains, and\r\nto the west of the Mississippi are bordered in part by the Ozark uplift.\r\nThere are certain reasons for believing that these two regions of\r\nelevation, characterized by a similar geological structure, are portions\r\nof a single greatly disturbed belt, but are now separated by a broad\r\narea which has been depressed and deeply covered with comparatively\r\nrecent sediments. But that this general view of the origin of the larger\r\nfeatures in the relief of the Gulf States can be accepted with\r\nentire confidence is questionable. True it is, however, that the delta\r\nregion of the Mississippi has undergone many up and down movements, and\r\nthat several successive sheets of sediment have been laid down upon it,\r\nbut that the folds and crumplings characteristic of the southern\r\nAppalachians and of the Ozark uplift extend across the intervening space\r\nbeneath the covering of horizontal rocks has not been demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf plains throughout are less than 500 feet above the sea, and\r\nmuch of the Gulf margin and the similar tract which extends northward to\r\nthe mouth of the Ohio has an elevation of less than 100 feet. The fringe\r\nof lowland bordering the Gulf and extending up the course of the\r\nMississippi is generally swampy and contains numerous small water bodies\r\nwhich owe their existence to the cutting off of the beds of the river so\r\nas to form what are termed ox-bow lakes.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the settlement of the Gulf plains by Europeans and the\r\nclearing of much of the land for plantations it was clothed with such a\r\ndense growth of trees and vines as to be almost impenetrable. The\r\nsouthern pine there reaches its greatest perfection and is the basis of\r\na great lumber industry, and oaks of several species, the wide-spreading\r\nwhite-trunked sycamore, the still more stately tulip-tree with its\r\ncup-like blossoms of yellow, the fragrant magnolia, the seemingly always\r\naged cypress, the gum-tree, and many other species of arboreal\r\nvegetation also find most congenial conditions for their growth. The\r\ndwarf palmetto, which forms such a characteristic growth in Florida,\r\nextends northward in the Mississippi basin to the southern border of the\r\nOzark uplift. Much of the luxuriant moss and lichen draped forest of the\r\nGulf plains with all its primitive network of shrubs and vines still\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n_The Prairie Plains._--A prairie in the current use of the term is a\r\ngenerally level region, either a plain or a plateau, without forests but\r\nclothed with a carpet of luxuriant grasses and flowering annuals. A\r\nrolling prairie is an undulating or hilly, grass-covered region. The\r\nGreat plains of the west-central portion of the Continental basin\r\nmeet these requirements, and are typical prairies. On their eastern and\r\nnorthern border the Prairie plains merge with the adjacent forested\r\nplains, and on the west from Mexico northward to the subarctic forest\r\npass by still less tangible gradations into the more elevated and drier\r\nGreat plateaus or high plains, where bunch-grass, with bare intervals\r\nbetween the scattered tufts, takes the place of the continuous sod of\r\nthe true prairies. The reasons for the change from forest to prairie and\r\nbeyond to the land of the bunch-grass as one travels from east to west\r\nacross the interior basin, lie in differences in the humidity of the\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nThe Prairie plains have their beginning at the south in Mexico a short\r\ndistance from the Rio Grande, and are prolonged northward through\r\ncentral Texas, meeting to the north of Red River the forest-covered\r\nOuachita Hills. But to the west of the Ozark uplift the Prairie plains\r\nextend northward in a belt about 100 miles wide which expands in Kansas,\r\nnorthern Missouri, eastern Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, and western Ohio to\r\nfully 800 miles. In this highly fertile region, now the most productive\r\nagricultural area of comparable size in North America, if not in the\r\nworld, one may travel in a straight line for nearly 1,000 miles through\r\na land without high hills but pleasingly diversified by undulations of\r\nthe generally level surface and by winding stream-formed valleys\r\nbordered by swelling bluffs, without losing sight of towns, villages, or\r\ncomfortable farmhouses. In spring this entire region is bright green\r\nwith pastures and sprouting grain-fields, and in autumn yellow with the\r\nharvest. Miles on miles of rustling corn-fields form the most\r\ncharacteristic feature of the summer landscapes.\r\n\r\nThe Prairie plains contract to the north of Illinois and Iowa to a width\r\nof about 200 miles, being encroached upon by the forests of the Great\r\nLakes region, but are prolonged northward through Minnesota and the\r\nDakotas far into Canada. The length of these natural meadows from south\r\nto north is nearly 2,000 miles; their entire area is not far from\r\n500,000 square miles. On the north they merge with the vast region\r\nof similar relief which is darkened by the pines and spruces of the\r\nsubarctic forest.\r\n\r\nThe northern portion of the original prairie region has been given a new\r\nand in some respects a more pleasing aspect by the sowing of millions of\r\nacres with wheat. This is the most favourable large area for wheat\r\nculture in North America, and one of the three great wheat-growing\r\nregions in the world. The most productive portion of these northern\r\nwheat-lands lies in the valley of the Red River of the North, situated\r\nin part in Minnesota and the eastern portion of the Dakotas, but\r\nincluding also the plains of Manitoba. Could we view the broad extent of\r\nthe Prairie plains as do the birds in their southward migrations, we\r\nwould see them golden with the sheen of ripening wheat at the north,\r\ngreen and russet in the central portion with corn, and white with cotton\r\nto the south. Everywhere from south to north and east to west the vast\r\nexpanse is dotted with the curling wreaths arising from household fires,\r\nand at hundreds of localities blotted by the smoke of towns, factories,\r\nsmelting-works, and coal-mines.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire extent of the Prairie plains the underlying rocks\r\nare essentially horizontal, and consist largely of limestone. An ancient\r\nsea-bottom has been broadly upraised with but slight disturbances of the\r\nstrata to a general elevation of about 800 feet in Minnesota and the\r\nDakotas. From this low continental divide the land slopes gently both to\r\nthe north and south. The local variations of surface are due mainly to\r\nthe unequal weathering of the rocks and the excavation of stream-formed\r\nvalleys. To the north of the mouth of the Ohio, however, the prairie, in\r\ncommon with the adjacent regions, was formerly occupied by glacial ice,\r\nwhich on melting left widely spread deposits of clay, stones, gravel,\r\netc., which gave the region a new surface, and in certain instances\r\nturned the streams from their former courses. Much of the rolling\r\nprairie inherits its billowy surface from the glaciers. In the midst of\r\nthe young topography of glacial and more recent date there is an area of\r\nabout 10,000 square miles in southwestern Wisconsin and adjacent\r\nportions of Minnesota and Iowa which is surrounded by the deposits of\r\nthe ancient ice-sheets (glacial drifts), but not covered by them. This\r\ndriftless area, as it is termed, has an old topography in striking\r\ncontrast to the relief of the region about it, in which broad\r\nriver-valleys bordered by the pinnacled and castellated rocks exposed in\r\nthe bordering slopes of the adjacent uplands are among the most\r\nconspicuous features.\r\n\r\nThe soil of this driftless region is a ferruginous clay, resulting from\r\nthe prolonged weathering of the rocks, principally limestone, on which\r\nit rests, while the surfaces formerly covered by glacial ice are mantled\r\nwith soil of a mixed character containing many fragments and large\r\nboulders of compact rock. In the prairies to the south of the glacial\r\nboundary the soils are mainly of a sedentary origin, and have resulted\r\nfrom the disintegration and decay of the rocks on which they rest, but\r\nusually rendered black by the humus resulting from the partial decay of\r\nnumberless generating grasses and other lowly plants. This black soil is\r\nwonderfully productive and furnishes the basis of the greater part of\r\nthe wealth and industries of the region it covers. The minor exceptions\r\nto the general fertility occur where the rocks immediately underlying\r\nthe surface, as in the zinc and lead region of southwestern Missouri,\r\nare highly charged with flint-like material, which remains when the\r\nlimestone once containing it is dissolved and carried away. The\r\nhorizontal sheets of rock beneath the broad central portion of the\r\nPrairie plains belong to the Carboniferous system and contain highly\r\nvaluable seams of bituminous coal. The area of these coal-producing\r\nlands is estimated at 125,000 square miles. In this same region also\r\nthere are extensive tracts in which natural gas and petroleum are\r\nobtained in remarkable abundance. In southern Wisconsin and the adjacent\r\nportions of Illinois valuable deposits of lead occur under conditions\r\nsimilar to those associated with the lead and zinc mines about the\r\nnorthern border of the Ozark uplift.\r\n\r\nOwing to the demand for transportation facilities and the mild\r\nrelief of the land, the entire extent of the Prairie plains is covered\r\nwith a double-lined network of steel. The ganglia in this pulsating\r\nnerve system of intercommunication are Chicago (here included, as it\r\nbelongs to the prairie as well as to the Great Lakes region), St. Louis,\r\nKansas City, Omaha, Minneapolis, St. Paul, etc., cities with from\r\n100,000 to over 1,500,000 inhabitants, and hundreds of lesser centres of\r\ntrade, manufacture, and education.\r\n\r\n_The Lake Plains._--The region draining to the Great Lakes--or the\r\nLaurentian lakes, as they may, perhaps, be more properly designated,\r\nsince they form the source of the river of that name--presents many\r\nstriking contrasts to the more monotonous treeless prairies skirting it\r\non the south and west.\r\n\r\nThe name \"Lake plains,\" suggested by J. W. Powell for the portion of the\r\nregion here referred to within the borders of the United States, when\r\nextended to the entire area draining to the Laurentian lakes, is in part\r\na misnomer, since much of its surface is rough and irregular. In a\r\ncertain sense, however, the term _plain_ is applicable, since it\r\nincludes a plain of water over 95,000 square miles in area. The combined\r\nareas of the lakes are greater than that of the region draining to them.\r\nThe land bordering the Laurentian lakes is underlaid to a large extent\r\nby horizontal or but slightly disturbed sedimentary rocks, but includes\r\non the north a portion of the contorted, crystalline terranes already\r\nreferred to as forming the Laurentian Highlands, and in general is\r\ncharacterized by the mildness of its relief. The elevations of the\r\nsurfaces of the several Laurentian lakes above the sea are, in feet, as\r\nfollows: Superior, 602; Michigan and Huron, 582; Erie, 373; and Ontario,\r\n247. The land forming the margins of these water bodies rises in general\r\nless than 300 feet above their surfaces. In portions of northern\r\nMichigan and in the region of crystalline rocks to the north of Lakes\r\nSuperior and Huron, however, the relief is more pronounced and there are\r\nmany bold rounded hills with basins between them.\r\n\r\nThe principal part of the nearly plane land surface about the Laurentian\r\nlakes is in immediate proximity to their borders, and records the\r\nformer extent of their waters. These plains, composed of clay deposited\r\nfrom the lakes when more widely expanded than at present, form a fringe\r\nfrom 5 to 50 or more miles broad all about the present lake margins.\r\nAcross this gently sloping surface the streams from the uplands,\r\nincreasing in length as the lakes were lowered, have excavated narrow,\r\nsteep-sided channels. These modern plains furnish typical illustrations\r\nof young topography.\r\n\r\nIn its primitive condition nearly the entire Laurentian lakes region was\r\ndensely covered with trees. Previous to the destruction which followed\r\nthe advance of the lumbermen its northern portion contained some of the\r\nfinest and most valuable white-pine forests on the continent. To the\r\nsouth of the Laurentian Lakes, and in a general way adjacent to the\r\nPrairie plains, there were park-like areas in the forest, known as\r\noak-openings, where picturesque bur-oak grew in open groves amid\r\nluxuriant natural meadows. These sunlit gardens, yellow and purple with\r\ngolden-rods and asters in autumn, owed their existence to soil\r\nconditions determined long previously by the streams issuing from the\r\nmargin of the retreating ice-sheet, which formed level areas of sand and\r\ngravel. The loose open texture of these deposits renders them less\r\nretentive of moisture than the neighbouring morainal hills, and during\r\nthe long hot summers all but the most deeply rooted of the trees that\r\nspring up upon them perished.\r\n\r\nThe soil throughout the Great Lake region is nearly all of glacial\r\norigin and presents many local variations, dependent principally on the\r\nfact that the streams flowing from the ice assorted the _debris_\r\ndelivered to them. The surface material, technically speaking, is of\r\nboth glacial and fluvio-glacial origin. The former consists principally\r\nof stony clay or _till_, and the latter of gravel. About the immediate\r\nborder of the existing lakes lacustral clays form the surface. The\r\nleading characteristics of the glacial and fluvio-glacial soils are\r\ntheir varied composition and endurance under cultivation. The glaciers\r\nthat ploughed the land preparatory to the present harvest gathered\r\ntogether a great variety of rock _debris_, much of it broken and\r\nunweathered and not leached of its more soluble constituents.\r\n\r\nThe most typical portion of the Lake plains, including the southern part\r\nof the province of Ontario and the southern shores of the Laurentian\r\nlakes from Minnesota to New York, is highly favourable for agricultural\r\npursuits, and produces in abundance a great variety of crops as well as\r\nrichly flavoured fruits, luscious berries, and healthful vegetables. The\r\nbeneficial influence of the neighbouring water bodies on the climate,\r\ntempering the heat of the summers and moderating the severity of the\r\nwinters, is shown especially in the distribution of the fruit belts of\r\nMichigan, Ohio, and New York, which are in regions where the prevailing\r\nwinds blowing over them come from the lakes.\r\n\r\n_The Subarctic Forest Plains._--The Prairie plains merge at the north\r\nwith a great tract of forest-covered lowlands, which extend from the\r\nLaurentian hills on the east to near the base of the Rocky Mountains on\r\nthe west. The change as one travels northward from the grassy prairies\r\nto the country of equally mild relief, but clothed with trees adapted to\r\na rigorous climate, is gradual. Along the irregular and in part\r\nindefinite junction of these two vast plains, the alignment of the\r\nforest is broken in many places, and its margin fringed by a picket-line\r\nof groves and of isolated trees, which has advanced southward and\r\ninvaded the grass-lands. Between these outposts the prairie with its\r\nwealth of summer bloom reaches well into the realm of perennial shadow.\r\nThe southward extensions of the forest are mainly in the valleys and\r\nadjacent to the streams, while the drier steppes between are open\r\ngrass-lands. No conspicuous change in the topography of the land or of\r\nthe rocks or the soil coincides with the change from grass to forest.\r\nThe differences in vegetation must therefore be sought in climatic\r\nconditions, and mainly in the influence of atmospheric changes on the\r\nwater contained in the soil.\r\n\r\nThroughout practically the whole of the region occupied by the subarctic\r\nforest, between Hudson Bay and the foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains,\r\nthe land is low and the valleys monotonous. Many lakes are\r\npresent, several of them of large size, and the rivers are remarkable\r\nfor their lengths, low gradients, and large volumes.\r\n\r\nThe subdued topography of the region here considered, and the presence\r\nof vast numbers of lakes and swamps, is due in general to the influence\r\nof the ice-sheets which formerly covered it. In a minor way the presence\r\nof the innumerable small lakes and swamps is owing to the obstructions\r\nformed by growing vegetation, the damming of streams by driftwood, the\r\nwork of beavers, and possibly the influence of subsoil ice.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the Subarctic Forest plain, as already described, occur\r\nthe desolate tracts known in Canada as the Barren Grounds, which form a\r\npart or merge into the tundras bordering the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\n_The Great Plateaus._--The boundary between the prairie plains of the\r\ncentral portion of the interior Continental basin and the Great plateaus\r\n(Great plains) bordering them on the west is usually indefinite. The\r\nprairies pass into the more elevated and drier plateaus by insensible\r\ngradations. The plateaus rise gradually from east to west, and along\r\ntheir western margin, adjacent to the east base of the Pacific\r\nmountains, attain a general elevation of from 5,000 to 6,000 feet. Over\r\nvast areas these monotonous plateaus, with their even sky-lines, are\r\nhigher above the sea than the crests of the Appalachians, and along\r\ntheir western margin in many localities even surpass in elevation the\r\nmost prominent peaks in the eastern portion of the United States.\r\nAccompanying this increase in elevation from east to west there is a\r\ndecrease in precipitation, and in consequence a marked change in the\r\nvegetation. The plateaus, like the prairies, are treeless in their most\r\ncharacteristic portions, but the larger rivers winding across them are\r\nmargined in many instances by giant cottonwoods.\r\n\r\nThe mental picture that a traveller over the broad plateaus retains in\r\nafter-years is of a vast treeless level tract of country, boundless as\r\nthe ocean, which is bright green and decked with lowly flowers in the\r\nearly spring, but becomes yellowish brown as the heat and dryness\r\nof summer increase and the grasses lose their freshness. Various\r\nportions of the plateaus, however, have their own individuality and\r\npresent characteristics which make them conspicuously different from\r\nother portions of the same great series of steppes. At the south, in the\r\nregion of the Rio Grande and of the Pecos and Canadian Rivers, the\r\nplateau is dissected by stream-cut valleys 1,000 feet or more deep, and\r\nfrom one to two score miles across, which divide it into a number of\r\nindividual table-lands. The plateau margins for many miles on each side\r\nof the larger river-valleys have been carved by a complex system of\r\nsecondary and usually ephemeral streams into a great variety of rock\r\nforms with deep trenches between. These conspicuously sculptured areas\r\nconstitute what are commonly termed Bad Lands. In certain regions also\r\nthe surfaces of the plateaus, more especially in Nebraska and South\r\nDakota, are broadly undulating or reveal a seemingly endless succession\r\nof ridges and hills separated by shallow depressions, due to the\r\npresence of large tracts of drifting sand. In spite of these several\r\nvariations, however, the leading characteristics of by far the larger\r\nportion of the plateau country are the generally level grass-covered\r\nsurfaces extending away in all directions far beyond the reach of\r\nvision. On the rolling prairie one can frequently see the undulating\r\nsurface about him for a distance of 15 or 20 miles, but the curvature of\r\nthe earth usually draws still narrower limits to the region within the\r\nview of the plainsman. In riding over the plains the scene changes but\r\nlittle from day to day and from week to week. Monotony is the one word\r\nthat best describes the lives of those whose lot is cast on these broad\r\nfeatureless surfaces. In journeying westward across the plateau over any\r\none of the transcontinental railways a moment of excitement occurs when\r\nthe even line of the western horizon is broken by the summit of a\r\ncloud-like mountain-peak. \"Land ho!\" is no more thrilling to voyagers on\r\nthe ocean than the shouts which first made known the presence of a\r\nmountain-peak to the bands of immigrants who slowly voyaged across this\r\nsea of grass with their picturesque \"prairie schooners\" previous\r\nto the building of the railroads which now bind together the East and\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\nThe Great plateaus begin indefinitely to the south of the Rio Grande,\r\nbroaden in the United States to a general width of about 400 miles, and\r\nextend far northward into Canada. Their northern limit has not as yet\r\nbeen determined, but is to be looked for near the head waters of the\r\nMackenzie. The length of the plateau country is in the neighbourhood of\r\n2,000 or 2,500 miles, and its average width about 300 miles. An estimate\r\nof the area with a generally plane surface and an elevation of from\r\n1,000 to 6,000 feet above the sea places it at about 700,000 square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe eastern portion of the Great plateaus includes western Texas,\r\nOklahoma, the central and western portions of Kansas and Nebraska, the\r\nwestern half of South Dakota, western North Dakota, western Assiniboia,\r\nand thence extend northward so as to include portions of Saskatchewan,\r\nAlberta, and Athabasca. On the west the plateau region includes the\r\neastern portions of New Mexico and Colorado, extends far into Wyoming,\r\nand embraces central and eastern Montana, and thence reaches northward\r\nto Mackenzie.\r\n\r\nThis region of essentially level plateaus, extending as it does from the\r\nhot lands of eastern Mexico nearly to the arctic circle, presents great\r\ndiversity of climate and also well-marked variations in the secondary\r\nfeatures of its relief. Of necessity it needs to be subdivided for more\r\ndetailed study. The rivers flowing eastward from the Rocky Mountains\r\nhave excavated valleys in the plateau region, and may be used as a basis\r\nfor its subdivision. This has been done by J. W. Powell for the portion\r\nwithin the borders of the United States, and the terms Pecos plateau,\r\nArkansas plateau, Platte plateau, and Missouri plateau have been\r\nproposed; this category may be extended especially to the northward, so\r\nas to include the less well-known Saskatchewan, Athabasca, Peace, and\r\nLaird plateaus. Each of these divisions is in reality a group of\r\nplateaus, for the reason that the broad areas between the\r\neastward-flowing rivers are trenched by lateral stream channels\r\ntributary to the main waterways, and thus subdivided into smaller units.\r\nThis subdivision of the plateau region by stream channels leaving\r\nflat-topped areas between them makes one instructive geographical\r\nprocess prominent--that is, the great table-land has been dissected. The\r\ndepths of the channels cut across it depend mainly on the elevation of\r\nthe land and the distance the streams have to travel to reach the sea;\r\nbut modifying conditions are furnished by the degree of resistance the\r\nrocks offer to erosion, the amount of precipitation, etc. If the\r\nelevation is great, the stream can cut deeply, and leave bold secondary\r\nplateaus between them; if the distance to the sea is short, other\r\nconditions being the same, the streams can cut more deeply than when\r\ntheir courses are long; if the rocks are resistant, they are left in\r\nbold escarpment bordering the valleys and the margins of the secondary\r\nplateaus are well defined, but if they are soft and crumble easily,\r\ntheir _debris_ is washed and blown into the rivers, and a general\r\nlowering of the surface without the formation of deep trenches is the\r\nresult. These and still other conditions have influenced the manner in\r\nwhich the Great plateaus have been dissected, and are of necessity to be\r\nconsidered in a critical discussion of the history of the land as\r\nrecorded in its relief.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for the dissection of the region under consideration is\r\nto be found in the fact that it is bordered on the west by high\r\nmountains where precipitation is abundant, and the streams, supplied\r\nlargely by the melting of the snow in summer, flow across a\r\ncomparatively rainless country. The stream channels in general have been\r\ndeepened at a more rapid rate than the areas between them have been\r\nlowered by erosion. Valleys running east and west have thus been\r\nexcavated, leaving the intervening spaces as uplands, which, however, in\r\ncertain instances have been minutely dissected by the streams\r\noriginating on them and supplied by local winter precipitation. Added to\r\nthese general conditions are differences in rock texture, which have led\r\nto great variations in the details due to erosions, particularly on the\r\nvalley borders.\r\n\r\nOne other condition which has modified the history of the plateau\r\nregion throughout, but most decidedly at the north, is the climatic\r\nchange which culminated in the Glacial epoch. During the time referred\r\nto the northern portion of the Great plateaus situated in Canada and the\r\nadjacent part of the United States was invaded by glacial ice which\r\nspread an irregular sheet of detritus over the country it occupied.\r\nDecided changes occurred also in the central and southern portion owing\r\nto increased precipitation, the flooding of the rivers leading from the\r\nmelting ice-front, and to movements in the earth's crust of as yet\r\nundetermined extent and amplitude. It is apparent to the geographer that\r\nmuch of the history of the climatic changes of glacial and post-glacial\r\ntimes is recorded in the relief of the interior Continental basin to the\r\nsouth of the limit reached by the ice and in the terraces and alluvial\r\ndeposits of the valleys, but as yet for the most part this interesting\r\nstory remains unread.\r\n\r\nThe most deeply dissected portion of the Great plateaus occurs in\r\nwestern Texas, eastern New Mexico, and Oklahoma. In that region the\r\nrivers having their sources in the Rocky Mountains and flowing to the\r\nGulf of Mexico have excavated deep and wide valleys, leaving broad\r\nintervening areas in bold relief.\r\n\r\nThe Pecos River drains a large part of the mountainous region in eastern\r\nNew Mexico, and flows through a valley of its own making, which is some\r\n30 or more miles broad and its bottom about 1,200 feet below the general\r\nsurface of the plateau lying to the eastward. The Canadian River has\r\nexcavated a similar valley, which is some 40 miles broad throughout much\r\nof its course, and is bordered by bold rocky escarpments from 1,000 to\r\n1,200 feet high, in which the edges of the horizontal strata underlying\r\nthe adjacent plateaus are exposed. This region of large and strongly\r\ndefined topographic features illustrates in a remarkable manner the\r\nnature of the work performed by streams which rise amid high mountains\r\nand flow across a dry plateau standing well above sea-level.\r\n\r\n_El Llano Estacado._--A typical portion of the great plateau region left\r\nby deep dissection is furnished by the table-land named by early\r\nMexican explorers \"El Llano Estacado,\" or the Staked Plains, in\r\nreference to the fact that owing to the monotony of the surface and the\r\nscarcity of water the routes of travel were at first marked by stakes.\r\nThis region, celebrated in the traditions of the Southwest frontier, is\r\ndescribed by Captain Marcy, who crossed its eastern portion in 1849, as\r\nbeing \"much elevated above the surrounding country, very smooth and\r\nlevel, and spreading out in every direction as far as the eye can\r\npenetrate, without a tree, shrub, or any other herbage to intercept the\r\nvision. The traveller in passing over it sees nothing but one dreary and\r\nmonotonous plain of barren solitude. It is an ocean of desert prairie,\r\nwhere the voice of man is seldom heard, and where no living being\r\npermanently resides. The almost total absence of water causes all\r\nanimals to shun it; even the Indians do not venture to cross it, except\r\nat two or three points, where they find a few small pools of water.\" As\r\nwill be shown below, the barrenness and desolation of this arid tract is\r\nnot so great as it seemed to those who first invaded its primeval\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\nEl Llano Estacado, or the _Llano_, as it is frequently termed, is about\r\n500 miles across from north to south, and 280 miles wide from east to\r\nwest. It is bordered on nearly all portions of its periphery by\r\ndescending escarpments which lead down to the adjacent valleys. Its\r\nsurface, although appearing horizontal, in reality slopes eastward at\r\nthe rate of about 20 feet per mile, and on its highest, northwest\r\nborder, has an elevation of 5,500 feet above the sea. This great\r\ntable-land has a smooth floor, and, as reported by recent explorers, is\r\nclothed with an abundance of bunch-grass, which formerly furnished\r\nsustenance to herds of antelope and deer. It was in this general region\r\nalso that some of the immense herds of buffalo which once inhabited the\r\nbroad plateaus found a winter range.\r\n\r\nThe Llano, together with its southward extension, having the same\r\ncharacteristics and known as the Edwards plateau, is bordered on the\r\nwest by the deep and broad valley of the southward-flowing Pecos River,\r\nand on the north by the equally deep and broad valley carved in the\r\nplateau country by the eastward-flowing Canadian River. The\r\neastward slope of the surfaces of the two plateaus is continued\r\nthroughout the region bordering them on the east all the way to the\r\nshore of the Gulf of Mexico. The streams originating on the eastern\r\nborder of the eastward sloping plateaus and flowing to the Gulf of\r\nMexico, represented at the present time by the Colorado (of Texas), the\r\nBrazos, Trinity, and Red Rivers, extended their trunks by head-water\r\ncorrasion and developed numerous branches so long as the rainfall was\r\nsufficient to maintain a surface drainage. But as the streams were\r\nlengthened they cut farther and farther westward and into a region that\r\nbecame drier and drier, until finally they reached a land in which all\r\nof the scanty rain that fell was absorbed by the thirsty soil. The\r\ndrainage from this higher and drier region is subterranean, and reaches\r\nthe head waters of the streams to the eastward to a considerable extent\r\nas springs. The streams which lowered the country to the eastward of the\r\nLlano developed many branches, some of which were extended westward into\r\nthe drier plateau country in such a manner as to give the eastern margin\r\nof the remaining upland a scalloped and irregular border.\r\n\r\nIn travelling westward up the courses of the rivers of eastern Texas,\r\none passes from a low region of old topography to one where the head\r\nbranches of the streams flow in canyons, and the relief has the\r\nruggedness of youth; on gaining the western border of the belt of\r\ncountry having surface streams one ascends to the smooth surface of the\r\nhigh plateau, which is young as regards stream development, although in\r\nyears older than the country with a deeply eroded surface to the\r\neastward. The Llano and Edwards plateau present us with examples of\r\nperpetuated topographic youthfulness.\r\n\r\nThe Llano, although dreaded by early explorers and shunned so far as\r\npossible even by experienced plainsmen, on account of a lack of water,\r\nhas in recent years become more favourably known. It is crossed at\r\npresent by two railroads. Water has been found beneath the surface in\r\nnumerous localities, and the desert-like region now bids fair to\r\nbecome a favourable cattle-raising country. It is not to be expected,\r\nhowever, that all the glowing predictions which have been published\r\nconcerning this and neighbouring table-lands will be more than partially\r\nfulfilled through the use of the subsurface waters.\r\n\r\n_The Arkansas Plateau._--To the north of the Canadian River the region\r\ntermed above the Great plateaus is less deeply dissected than in the\r\nportion of which the Llano is typical, and the streams from the\r\nmountains flow through shallow valleys with less rugged and less\r\npicturesque borders than those of the deep wide valleys of western Texas\r\nand eastern New Mexico. The broad plateau surfaces adjacent to the\r\nvalleys of the Arkansas and Platte Rivers probably come nearer to the\r\npopular idea of the essential characteristics of the \"Great plains\" than\r\nany other of the larger divisions of the region under review. The most\r\nconspicuous geographic features of the Arkansas plateau have been\r\ndescribed by W. D. Johnson as consisting of an assemblage of low and\r\nbroad table-lands separated by shallow erosion valleys. The plateaus are\r\nimmense unsculptured remnants in light relief of an older and originally\r\nperfect plain. The few long and feeble streams, wide apart and flowing\r\neastward from the distant mountains in parallel courses and without\r\ntributaries, have blocked out by dissection the larger features of the\r\nbroad landscape which in future ages will be slowly etched into a\r\nmultitude of details. The scenery of these featureless plains is\r\nordinarily depressing when once the novelty of being adrift on a sea of\r\ngrass has passed away. There is nothing that can be termed scenery\r\nexcept that which once a year for a brief period the sky affords when\r\nclouds of extraordinary grandeur darken the air. Throughout nearly the\r\nentire annual course there is no material for landscape effect except\r\nthe straight line of the horizon with a featureless breadth of sun-faded\r\nbrown below it and above a merely broader space of faded blue. There is\r\nnowhere a curved line, and though as a scientific fact there is vast\r\nexpanse of flat plain, there is little to suggest it when the sky is\r\nempty of clouds. In June the clouds come with a gradual maturing at some\r\npoint along the even sky-line, and increase rapidly until the\r\nheavens are filled with magnificent vapour banks; but the display is\r\nsimply spectacular, and passes away in a few hours as quickly as it\r\ncame, with only local showers to refresh the land.\r\n\r\nThe one industry that can thrive on the Arkansas plateau, which was\r\nformerly at certain seasons blackened by herds of bison, is\r\nstock-raising. Wells from which water is pumped by windmills furnish\r\nsufficient water for herds of cattle and horses, but not for irrigation.\r\n\r\n_Bad Lands._--In the northern portion of the Great plateaus within the\r\nUnited States the surface rocks over great areas are soft or but\r\nirregularly hardened sediments of ancient lakes and streams and have\r\nbeen sculptured by rain, wind, and ephemeral rills into a most\r\nmarvellous array of monumental and castellated forms. Localities where\r\nthis minute dissection of the soft horizontal strata is especially well\r\nmarked over hundreds of square miles occur in South Dakota and Montana,\r\nand especially on the borders of the valleys carved by the Loup Fork,\r\nNiobrara, White, Yellowstone, and Missouri Rivers. In this region the\r\nrainfall is light, the mean annual precipitation being in the\r\nneighbourhood of 15 inches, and occurs mostly during the winter months.\r\nIn the summer season the lands far out on the plateaus are dry and hot,\r\nand all but the larger streams disappear. The rocks, consisting mostly\r\nof unconsolidated clays and soft sandstones, with occasional hard layers\r\nand irregular concretions, have been cut into innumerable channels,\r\nleaving steep-sided remnants of the former plain between. The maze of\r\ntrench-like valleys, the similarity of the sculptured land-forms one to\r\nanother, and the absence of water, make these desert regions excessively\r\ndifficult to traverse. The Canadian-French who explored the\r\nnorth-central portion of the Great plateaus in early days of American\r\nsettlement termed these tracts of country, so difficult to cross,\r\n_Mauvaises Terres_, a name now seldom used, but replaced by the English\r\nname Bad Lands. Although _bad_ to the hunter and the plainsman, these\r\ndesert regions are of fascinating interest to men of scientific\r\ntraining. The intense heat, the choking alkaline dust, the absence of\r\nwater, and the danger of being lost and of perishing of thirst in\r\nthese wild silent regions, have not checked the ardour of explorers. Not\r\nonly do the Bad Lands present a most attractive field to the student of\r\nerosion and of the origin of earth forms, but their deathlike solitudes\r\nhave been made to yield the most wonderful procession of strange extinct\r\nanimals yet unearthed by geologists. They are vast cemeteries in which\r\nare interred the skeletons of many genera and hundreds of species of\r\nanimals which lived in the ancient lakes or wandered through the almost\r\ntropical forest that in distant ages clothed the adjacent country. The\r\ngreat lesson to be learned by the geographer in these uninviting regions\r\nas they seem to most people relates to the way in which the rocks have\r\nbeen eroded. The prevailing softness of the beds with occasional hard\r\nlayers, the scarcity of vegetation, the occasional heavy rains, and the\r\nconsiderable height of the country above the master streams combine to\r\nfavour rapid and deep sculpturing. The precipitous slopes of the small\r\nmesas and castle-like rock forms destitute of all vegetation excepting\r\nsucculent cacti and scattered clumps of bunch-grass, reveal a multitude\r\nof sunken lines and raised edges, produced by the ephemeral streams, and\r\na less complex series of horizontal ledges due to the prominent edges of\r\nhard layers. The steep slopes are worn into alcoves and irregular\r\nrecesses by the transient rills, and smoothed or etched by the\r\nwind-driven sands. The result is an assemblage of architectural forms\r\nsuch as only the most fantastic dream pictures or the strange tricks of\r\nthe mirage on northern ice-fields can simulate. Nor are the wonderfully\r\nintricate topographical forms the sole attraction. The rocks are\r\nvariously coloured, and present endless combinations of yellow, red,\r\ngreen, purple, etc., in many tints and shades, rendered seemingly\r\nbrilliant by contrast with the gray of shales and the blackness of\r\noccasional coal-seams. Owing to the burning of coal-beds, the rocks are\r\nsometimes altered over broad areas and given unusually striking colours,\r\namong which various shades of red predominate. Standing on some\r\ncommanding crag in the Bad Lands in the early morning or when the purple\r\nshadows of evening fill the gorges and ravines, the most unimaginative\r\ntraveller sees in the silence about him the ruins of a vast city, with\r\ncathedrals, temples, and palaces of varied colours and weird designs\r\nsuch as no mortal hand ever fashioned. It is at such times that the\r\npicturesque and gorgeous, although desolate, landscape kindles the fancy\r\nand suggests day dreams which distract one's attention from the more\r\nprosaic study of these earth ruins.\r\n\r\nThe best developed portions of the strange region here referred to occur\r\non the borders of the uplands overlooking the larger valleys, excavated\r\nby the rivers flowing eastward from the mountains, and are simply larger\r\nexamples of erosion, such as may be seen in many bluffs and valley-sides\r\nin nearly every country, but rendered conspicuous by their size, extent,\r\nendless variety, and unusual colours.\r\n\r\n_Sand-Hills._--The sands winnowed by the winds from the bare plains and\r\nsteep bluffs are in certain places on the Great plateaus gathered into\r\ndunes which cover great areas with a succession of low dome-shaped\r\nhills. On the borders of the Niobrara River there is a detached area of\r\nabout 20,000 square miles, which has been covered in this manner with\r\nloose sands. This region, as described by F. V. Hayden, presents a\r\nsuccession of round-topped hills, some of them scooped out by the\r\nswirling winds so as to resemble volcanic craters. These sand-hills were\r\nformerly a favourite resort of the bison, which fed upon the scanty but\r\nvery nutritious grasses in the little valleys and intervals among the\r\nmounds and ridges. There is, for the most part, an abundant supply of\r\nwater in the lakelets scattered through the region, and fed by the\r\nseepage from the porous sands, which drink in all the water that falls\r\nupon them and allow it to percolate slowly into the adjacent\r\ndepressions. Some of the lakelets and ponds are highly alkaline, while\r\nothers are fresh; the former can be easily distinguished from the latter\r\nby the absence of vegetation about their borders. The hills, although\r\nseemingly utterly desolate, on a nearer view sometimes reveal\r\nconsiderable vegetation, including yuccas or \"Spanish needles,\" which\r\nshelter the sands from the winds.\r\n\r\nMany other regions on the western border of the Great plateaus, in the\r\nvalleys of the Rocky Mountains and on the desert plains of Utah, Nevada,\r\nand California, are buried beneath drifting sands, which have the\r\ncharacteristic features of a dune-covered seacoast. The sources of the\r\nsands in these interior plains are usually to be found in the\r\ndisintegration of the rocks under the action of the dry air with its\r\nmany and sudden changes of temperature, but occasionally they come from\r\ndesiccated lake beds not yet clothed with vegetation.\r\n\r\n_Central Portion of the Great Plateaus._--The State of Nebraska, about\r\n400 miles in length from east to west, and extending across the Great\r\nplateaus to within some 60 miles of the mountains bordering them on the\r\nwest, furnishes a typical example of the west-central portion of the\r\ninterior Continental basin. As described by Hayden, this State may be\r\ndivided into two portions, one agricultural and the other pastoral. The\r\neastern part, included in the Prairie plains, contains some of the most\r\nbeautiful, gently rolling, and fertile agricultural lands in America.\r\nBut the western part is a treeless, almost waterless plain; yet thick,\r\nlow, sweet, nutritious grasses cover the entire surface, and render it\r\nwell adapted for the raising of large numbers of horses, cattle, and\r\nsheep. Over western Nebraska not more than 15 or 20 inches of moisture\r\nfall annually; the snows of winter are very light and soon pass away,\r\nthe winds rapidly gathering them into the valleys and gorges, leaving\r\nvast areas entirely bare. The grasses, instead of decaying, as in all\r\ntemperate countries with a humid climate, slowly wither, retaining all\r\ntheir nutritious qualities, and thus continue until April or May, when\r\nthe fresh shoots spring up, so that all kinds of stock thrive throughout\r\nthe winter on the open plains without artificial shelter. In this\r\naccount, however, the author cited fails to note that the winters are\r\nfrequently marked by exceedingly severe storms termed blizzards, during\r\nwhich gales blow while the temperature is far below freezing, and that\r\nat such times cattle have been known to perish by thousands.\r\n\r\nIn late summer and autumn the streams in this portion of the plateau\r\nregion for the most part become dry, although water may usually be\r\ndiscovered at long intervals in pools in their beds. In ascending the\r\nvalleys the water appears and disappears as if by magic. Here one finds\r\na swift-running stream several yards broad, and then for a considerable\r\ndistance nothing is to be seen but a dry and dusty creek bed, resembling\r\na sunken roadway. Even the broad Platte has so far forgotten itself for\r\nseveral seasons as to cease to be a running stream. It is not uncommon\r\nfor a river originating in the mountains on the west to be considerably\r\nlarger towards its source than near its mouth. Many of the important\r\nstreams that flow from the Black Hills towards the Missouri are lost on\r\ntheir way through the plains. The Yellowstone and the Missouri, the two\r\nmost important rivers crossing the Great plateaus in the northern\r\nportion of the United States, retain their existence throughout the\r\nyear, although becoming greatly shrunken in autumn, and send eastward a\r\nnever-ceasing tribute to the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n_Northern Extension of the Great Plateaus._--The Great plateaus cross\r\nthe United States-Canadian boundary and extend northwestward through the\r\nwestern portion of Assiniboia and Saskatchewan, and embrace nearly the\r\nwhole of Alberta and western Athabasca. At the international boundary\r\nthe plateau region is about 470 miles broad, and extends from longitude\r\n103 deg. 30' westward to the foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains, and in this\r\nregion embraces what is frequently termed the third prairie steppe,\r\nknown in part as the Missouri Coteau. The east border of this high\r\nplateau throughout much of its extent is well marked by an escarpment\r\nwhich descends some 300 or 400 feet to the second prairie steppe, which\r\ntogether with the first or most easterly of the series, embracing the\r\nRed River Valley, is usually considered as belonging to the Prairie\r\nplains. The third steppe in the series, or the one extending from the\r\nRed River to the Rocky Mountains, has an elevation along its eastern\r\nborder of about 2,000 feet, rises gradually to the westward, and attains\r\na general elevation of over 4,000 feet on its western border. All of the\r\nregion of the Great plateaus north of the international boundary,\r\nwith the exception of about 20,000 square miles tributary to the\r\nMissouri, is drained by rivers flowing eastward to Hudson Bay or\r\nnorthward to the Arctic Ocean. It is thus a portion of the northern or\r\narctic slope of the Continental basin. The eastern border of the plateau\r\ncountry trends northwestward, and finally reaches the Rocky Mountains in\r\nthe vicinity of the head waters of the Mackenzie, but as this region is\r\nbut imperfectly explored, our knowledge of the boundaries of the natural\r\ndivision of the continent we have been endeavouring to trace there\r\nbecomes indefinite. The Great plateaus in Canada merge into the Prairie\r\nplains bordering them on the east, and in large part the position of the\r\ndividing line between the two is arbitrary.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the Great plateaus in Canada, like the similar region to\r\nthe south, is covered with bunch-grass, which dries as it stands and\r\nforms highly nutritious self-cured hay. Formerly this region was the\r\nwinter feeding-ground for vast herds of bison. The winters, although\r\ncold, are not characterized by a heavy snowfall, and even in midwinter\r\nthe warm dry _chinook_ winds, as they are termed, similar to the _foehn_\r\nwinds of Switzerland, frequently cause the snow to disappear and leave\r\nthe brown plateau surfaces free for grazing. Now that the bison has\r\ndisappeared, this immense region is favourable in many ways for\r\nstock-raising, but, unlike the lower prairies to the east with their\r\nrich black soil and long hot summers, is not suitable for agriculture.\r\nThe main difficulties in the way of successful farming lie in the\r\ndryness of the summers, and the scarcity of water available for\r\nirrigation. The rivers flow in valleys several hundred feet below the\r\ngeneral plateau surfaces, and hence cannot be made available for\r\nirrigating the uplands without too great an expense. In the bottoms of\r\nthe valleys, however, adjacent to the stream, limited areas are now\r\nunder cultivation, and it is to be expected that the wheat-fields of the\r\nprairie region will be gradually extended into the valley to the\r\nwestward, and perhaps even to the eastern margin of the plateaus. A\r\ngreater extension of the wheat-belt to the north and west than is now\r\nthought practicable has been predicted, but what the ultimate\r\nlimit will be cannot be told.\r\n\r\n_The Black Hills of Dakota._--As stated in the brief account already\r\ngiven of the Prairie plains, their monotony of surface and of geological\r\nstructure is broken by a single area of disturbance termed the Ozark\r\nuplift. Similarly, the vast generally level expanse of the Great\r\nplateaus is broken by a single rudely circular region of elevation, the\r\nBlack Hills of Dakota, which has been sculptured by atmospheric agencies\r\nand given a diversified topography, in striking contrast with the even\r\nmonotony of the country surrounding it.\r\n\r\nThis protuberance on the surface of the Great plateaus is situated in\r\nthe southwest portion of South Dakota, and embraces also a part of\r\nWyoming, and about 140 miles east of the nearest range--the Big Horn\r\nMountains--of the Rocky Mountain chain. It rises from the surrounding\r\nplateau to a height on an average of about 2,000 to 2,500 feet; the\r\nhighest summit, Harney Peak, is 3,000 feet above the plain, and 7,216\r\nfeet above the sea. The uplift is elliptical in ground plan, with a\r\nnorthwest and southeast axis measuring about 120 miles, and a transverse\r\ndiameter of 40 to 50 miles. Its area is in the neighbourhood of 6,000\r\nsquare miles.\r\n\r\nWhile the generally level plateau surface about the Black Hills is\r\ntreeless, except for the scattered groves of wide-spreading cottonwoods\r\nalong the immediate banks of the larger streams, the central and higher\r\nportions of the elevation itself is clothed with an open but abundant\r\nforest, consisting principally of pines. The evergreen forests give to\r\nthe hills a nearly black colour when seen from a distance, and have\r\ngained for them the name they bear.\r\n\r\nThe rocks which have been forced upward so as to form the Black Hills\r\ndome were previously like those in the surrounding plain, quite\r\nhorizontal, and had a vertical thickness of at least 5,000 feet. The\r\nuplift, if uneroded, would rise from the surrounding plain as a\r\nflat-topped dome about 6,600 feet high, as is suggested by the highest\r\ndotted line in the following diagram. In reality such a dome never\r\nexisted, for the reason that its growth was slow, and perhaps is\r\nnot completed even at the present day, and as soon as the rocks began to\r\nrise, the rain, wind, streams, etc., commenced their task of\r\ndestruction. The higher the rocks were elevated the more powerfully\r\nthose agencies acted. The top of the dome was soon broken and its\r\ninternal structure revealed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Ideal east-and-west section through the Black\r\nHills. The vertical scale is about six times the horizontal. The dotted\r\nlines indicate the portion of the uplift removed by erosion. After Henry\r\nNewton.\r\n\r\n  1.

White River Tertiary, shales, resting unconformably on 7.]\r\n\r\nBy reference to the accompanying generalized section through the Black\r\nHills, which as the uplift is rudely circular would be essentially the\r\nsame if taken in any direction through the elevated region, it will be\r\nseen that there is a central core of slate, schists, and granite which\r\nhas been forced upward so as to stand in its present eroded condition;\r\nit rises well above the surface of the adjacent plateau. About this\r\ncentral core the upturned edges of the sedimentary rocks form concentric\r\nzones, the oldest in the series being next the schists, and the youngest\r\n10 to 40 or 50 miles distant. It is the presence in the central part of\r\nthe hills of an area of resistant crystalline rocks which have weathered\r\ninto rugged forms, and the series of encircling and concentric belts of\r\nrock of varying degrees of hardness and solubility, that has given to\r\nthe uplift its present peculiar relief and its generally beautiful\r\nscenery. The edges of the harder belts form bold hills and ridges, while\r\nthe softer belts have been eroded into valleys. This series of\r\nsharp-crested ridges and intervening valleys forms concentric circles\r\ncompletely surrounding the central group of rugged mountains. The\r\nlargest and most interesting of the ring-like valleys is underlaid by\r\nred sandstone, and is remarkable for its flaming colour as well as for\r\nits exceptional form. In this Red Valley one may ride entirely around\r\nthe rugged central mass of the hills, on a generally level surface,\r\nwhich is inclosed on its outer border by a precipitous wall of yellowish\r\nsandstone and shale 300 or 400 feet high. The distance about this\r\n\"race-course,\" as it is sometimes termed, is about 200 miles. This\r\nseries of concentric ridges and intervening valleys, surrounding a high\r\nand rugged region of more resistant rock, furnish an admirable\r\nillustration of the influence of rock texture, hardness, etc., on\r\ntopography.\r\n\r\nAnother instructive geographical lesson afforded by the Black Hills is\r\nthe manner in which the portion of the dome rising above the level of\r\nthe rivers which flow across the surrounding plain has been dissected by\r\nstream erosion. The streams originating in the central portion of the\r\nuplift flowed outward in all directions, and have cut deep narrow gorges\r\nthrough the ridges of hard rock in the base of the truncated dome. Some\r\n20 streams originating in the central portion of the uplift cross Red\r\nValley and escape through notches in its outer wall, about 16 of which\r\nare well-defined gateways leading to the encircling plateau. This is one\r\nof the most beautiful and most instructive examples of _consequent_\r\ndrainage--that is, of streams whose direction has been determined by the\r\ninclination of the surface over which they flow--thus far discovered.\r\nStill another feature of much geographical interest is furnished by the\r\nrivers on the adjacent plain, two of which, branches of the Cheyenne\r\nRiver, cross the north and south extensions, respectively, of the Black\r\nHills dome. These streams flow directly across the arched strata, in\r\ncanyons of their own making, and, as explained by G. K. Gilbert, are\r\nillustrations of _superimposed_ drainage--that is, the portions of the\r\ndome crossed by the branches of the Cheyenne after the rocks were\r\nupheaved were covered by soft horizontal lake beds, over which the water\r\nflowed as consequent streams. The rivers deepened their channels and\r\ncut through the soft cover of horizontal rock and into the arched\r\nbeds beneath. The course of the streams initiated on the covering of\r\nsoft beds were maintained, as the flowing water charged with sand cut\r\ndownward into the harder, upturned beds beneath, and now, the covering\r\nof soft beds having been eroded away, the rivers flow directly across\r\n(or through) the flanks of the great arch, but are not deflected by it.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of the Black Hills, and especially about their\r\nnorthern and northwestern border, there are secondary hills formed by\r\nthe upward protrusion of molten rocks into the generally horizontally\r\nstratified rocks underlying the plateau. These intrusions did not reach\r\nthe surface in such a way as to form volcanoes, but were forced upward,\r\nraising domes above them, in which the structure is similar to that in\r\nthe great Black Hills dome. These secondary domes have been eaten away\r\nby erosive agencies in varying degrees. In some of them, as the Little\r\nSundance Hill, near the town of Sundance, Wyoming, the dome of\r\nstratified rock is unbroken, and no igneous rock is to be seen; other\r\nneighbouring domes in which the plutonic magmas rose higher have been\r\neroded so as to expose the summit portion of the inner core; and in one\r\ninstance, known as Mato Tepee, the uncovering of the plug of plutonic\r\nrock which caused the uplift is so complete that it now forms a\r\nprominent fluted column over 600 feet high above its immediate base.\r\n\r\n_Volcanic Mountains and Table-Lands._--In the south-central portion of\r\nthe Great plateaus in southwestern Colorado and eastern New Mexico,\r\nthere are several typical cinder cones with lava-flows associated with\r\nthem, which impart novel topographic forms to the general monotony of\r\nthe broad plateau surfaces. The highest of the extinct volcanoes in this\r\nregion is Mount Capulin, situated in northeastern New Mexico, about 200\r\nmiles east of the Rocky Mountains, which rises 2,750 feet above the\r\nsurrounding plain, and has an elevation of about 9,000 feet above the\r\nsea. At the summit of this conical mass there is a well-defined crater a\r\nmile in diameter. In the same region there are several other\r\nsimilar volcanic cones, from which lava streams have descended. As has\r\nbeen pointed out by R. T. Hill, these are the most easterly volcanoes of\r\nrecent geological age in North America. They were formed after the\r\nTertiary rocks of the Llano were laid down.\r\n\r\nThe Raton Mesa, situated between Mount Capulin and the front range of\r\nthe Rockies, is capped by a lava flow of more ancient date than the\r\nvolcanoes just referred to, which has protected the softer rocks beneath\r\nfrom erosion, and now stands as a prominent table-land with precipitous\r\nborders.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE PACIFIC MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nTo the west of the Continental basin is a vast cordillera composed of\r\nnumerous mountain chains which extends from south-central Mexico\r\nnorthward to the Arctic Ocean, and in its broadest part is about 1,000\r\nmiles wide. As already explained, we speak of this region in its\r\nentirety as the Pacific cordillera, or less technically as the Pacific\r\nmountains. It is a highly complex group of mountain chains, each of\r\nwhich contains two or more distinct mountain systems; each system,\r\nagain, is usually composed of many ranges, and each range is frequently\r\nmade up of a multitude of ridges, peaks, buttes, mesas, etc.; there are\r\nalso many plateaus more or less completely dissected by erosion, and\r\nbroad valleys, as well as numerous canyons, gulches, ravines, arroyas,\r\nand other secondary topographic forms. This vast cordillera not only\r\ncontains mountains produced by the folding of the rocks of the earth's\r\ncrust, in a general way similar to the Appalachians in structure, but\r\nalso upturned blocks many miles in extent, bounded by breaks or faults,\r\nand volcanic mountains, vast lava-flows, and elevations due to the\r\ninjection of molten rock into the earth's crusts so as to elevate domes.\r\nIn fact, scarcely any topographic form and no important geological\r\nstructure that is known is lacking in this great family of mountains\r\nwhich dominates the western portion of the continent.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific mountains begin abruptly at the south, along a generally\r\neast and west line passing some 75 miles south of the City of\r\nMexico, where the precipitous border of the table-land of central Mexico\r\noverlooks a lower region to the south which is diversified by many\r\nvolcanic mountains. But little accurate information is available\r\nconcerning the geology and geography of Mexico, but in general, as is\r\nwell known, there are three main mountain belts which traverse that\r\nrepublic. One of these mountain belts is adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nand another is situated near the Pacific coast of the main portion of\r\nthe republic, while the third forms the rugged and irregular axis of the\r\npeninsula of Lower California. Between the leading mountain belts of the\r\nmainland there are numerous short ranges and many nearly level-floored\r\nvalleys. The general level of this inland region is in the neighbourhood\r\nof 6,000 feet, while the more prominent peaks and crests attain\r\nelevations of from 10,000 to 12,000 feet. The general trend of the main\r\nmountain belts, and of the numerous subordinate ranges, is about\r\nnorthwest and southeast. For this reason, and also because the valleys\r\nhave become deeply filled with _debris_ from the mountains, travelling\r\nin directions leading north and south is facilitated by the topography,\r\nwhile in passing from one coast of the republic to the other the rugged\r\nbordering mountain belts have to be crossed and detours made in order to\r\npass around the central mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nThe more elevated portion of central and northern Mexico, together with\r\nthe peninsula of Lower California, has an arid climate, to which many of\r\nthe conspicuous features in the geography of the land are due. The\r\nprecipitation over large areas is insufficient to maintain permanent\r\nstreams, the vegetation is nearly all of a desert-like character, and\r\nseveral basins exist which do not drain to the sea. In the interior\r\nbasins there are saline and alkaline lakes, and numerous dry lake beds\r\nor _playas_, which are whitened by saline efflorescences. The rocks\r\nexposed in the mountains are largely of sedimentary origin, but a\r\ncharacteristic feature is the geology, especially to the west, in the\r\npresence of extensive volcanic areas and lofty mountains of igneous\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific cordillera begins in southern Mexico with a width of some\r\n300 miles and broadens when traced northward. At the boundary between\r\nMexico and the United States it has a width of fully 700 miles, but\r\nreaches its greatest breadth in the latitude of San Francisco and\r\nDenver, where it is about 1,000 miles across. In its better known, but\r\nas yet incompletely studied portion embraced within the boundaries of\r\nthe United States there are several important subdivisions, such as the\r\nRocky Mountain belt on the east; a less lofty, but yet rugged central\r\nregion, termed the Great Basin, characterized by having a dry climate\r\nand by the fact that the streams do not reach the ocean; and a western\r\nmountain chain which includes the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Ranges. To\r\nthe west of the mountains just named lies the great valley of\r\nCalifornia, and similar regions in Oregon and Washington occupied in\r\npart by Puget Sound. To the west, again, are the several ranges\r\nbordering the Pacific coast from Lower California to Vancouver Island,\r\nand termed in a general way the coast mountains. Each of the great\r\ndivisions of the Pacific mountain region has its indefinitely known\r\nsouthern terminus in Mexico, and extends northward to beyond the\r\nCanadian boundary. As this central portion of the most westerly of the\r\nlarger geographical divisions of the continent is well developed in the\r\nUnited States, and has there been more carefully explored than\r\nelsewhere, a review of its leading features will serve to give as good\r\nan idea of the entire Pacific mountain region as is now practicable.\r\n\r\n_The Rocky Mountains._--The limitations to the north and south of the\r\nregion to which this name is more or less specifically applied are not\r\nwell defined. Perhaps the most accurate statement at present permissible\r\nis that the Rocky Mountains begin at the south, in northern Mexico, and\r\nextend northward across the United States and Canada to near the shore\r\nof the Arctic Ocean. On the east it is sharply defined by its junction\r\nwith the Great plateaus. Its western border, although less definite than\r\nthe eastern, is easily traced, at least across the greater portion of\r\nthe United States, by the marked contrast it presents to the\r\ngeographical conditions characteristic of the Great Basin region,\r\nbut owing to the many difficulties met with in attempting to adjust and\r\nmake use of the current nomenclature in classifying geographical regions\r\nmore or less artificial boundaries have to be accepted. The Great Basin\r\nis so designated because it is a region of interior drainage--that is,\r\nit does not send any tribute to the sea. Its boundaries are therefore\r\nthe crest-lines of the surrounding divides or water-partings. The Rocky\r\nMountains, on the other hand, are defined as an elevated region, the\r\nboundaries of which are determined by relief and not by drainage. The\r\nbasis of classification in these two instances is not the same, and one\r\nprovince overlaps the other. The streams flowing westward from the Rocky\r\nMountains into the Great Basin--such, for example, as Bear, Provo, and\r\nSevier Rivers in Utah--have their sources well within the Rocky Mountain\r\nprovince as defined by uplift, but yet lie wholly within the Great Basin\r\nprovince as defined by drainage. In spite of this inconsistency,\r\ngeographers recognise as the western border of the Rocky Mountains the\r\nirregular and in part indefinite line where the elevated region breaks\r\ndown and meets the broad level-floored valleys characteristic of the\r\nGreat Basin. This line, or more properly belt of country, although\r\nindefinite at the south, may for convenience be taken as beginning at\r\nthe head of the Gulf of California, and extending up the Colorado River\r\nfor about 300 miles, to where that river makes an abrupt bend, turning\r\nsouthward after a westerly course through the Grand Canyon. From the\r\nlocality indicated, the boundary passes through central Utah, and is\r\nsharply defined for most of the way by the bold western escarpment of\r\nthe Wasatch Range. In the neighbourhood of Great Salt Lake the border of\r\nthe mountain belt trends more and more to the northwest, crosses Idaho\r\ndiagonally, and in northern Washington merges with or closely approaches\r\nthe Cascade Mountains. In this northern region the border of the Rocky\r\nMountains is again indefinite, and until the geological structure of\r\nwestern Canada is more thoroughly studied can only be located\r\nprovisionally.\r\n\r\nThe unsatisfactory condition of the nomenclature at present applied to\r\nthe larger topographic features of North America is illustrated by the\r\nfact that to the north of the United States-Canadian boundary the term\r\n_Rocky Mountains_ is much more restricted than is the custom in the\r\nUnited States. In Canada this name is applied to the most easterly of\r\nthe ranges or chains of the Pacific cordillera. This difference in the\r\nsignificance of the name referred to on the opposite sides of the\r\ninternational boundary is unfortunate, but is due in large part to our\r\nignorance of the geography and geology not only immediately along the\r\nboundary line, but generally throughout the rugged region of the\r\nnorthwest portion of the continent.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important geographic features in the central part of the\r\nUnited States is the presence in Wyoming of a broad, generally flat,\r\nregion known as the Laramie plateau (plains) and its extension westward\r\nacross nearly the entire width of the Rocky Mountains. The general\r\nelevation of these \"plains\" is about 7,000 feet, or approximately 1,000\r\nfeet greater than that of the western border of the Great plateaus. The\r\nLaramie plateau and country to the west having a similar topography,\r\nfurnished a convenient pass for the Union Pacific, the oldest of the\r\ntranscontinental railroads, and divides the Rocky Mountain belt into two\r\nportions, which may be termed in a general way the northern and southern\r\nRocky Mountains respectively.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the Union Pacific Railroad there are several important\r\nmountain groups, termed collectively the Stony Mountains by Lewis and\r\nClark in the report of their bold explorations across the continent in\r\n1804, but not generally used since that time. This name has recently\r\nbeen revived by J. W. Powell as a convenient term by which to designate\r\nthis large division of the Rocky Mountain belt, but unfortunately is not\r\nrecognised and has no significance to the north of the international\r\nboundary. What the natural limitations of the Stony Mountains may be in\r\nCanada remains to be determined.\r\n\r\nThe Stony Mountain system includes the Big Horn Mountains in\r\nnorth-central Wyoming, the sharp and lofty Teton Range to the\r\nsouth of the Yellowstone National Park, and several other rugged uplifts\r\nof great extent in Montana and Idaho, and should the name be extended to\r\nthe north of the international boundary until a natural limit is\r\nreached, it will include the Rocky Mountains of Canadian geographers\r\n(the most eastern of the great uplifts constituting the Rocky Mountain\r\nbelt), together with the several ranges of the Gold Mountains. These\r\nseveral mountain ranges and groups of ranges appear to have diverse\r\ngeological structure, but their histories are by no means thoroughly\r\nunderstood. Some of them, as stated by Powell, are carved out of broad\r\nfolds, and involve both originally deeply seated igneous and metamorphic\r\nrocks and upturned and folded sedimentary beds; while others are due to\r\nmovements along lines of fracture and in part of overthrust.\r\n\r\nThe Stony Mountains form a portion of the continental divide which parts\r\nthe waters flowing to the Pacific from those that find their way to the\r\nAtlantic. The thousands of streams tributary to the Missouri head\r\nagainst the equally numerous fountains supplying the westward-flowing\r\nColumbia. The broad valleys between the several ranges have a general\r\nelevation of between 7,000 and 8,000 feet, and the bold, massive\r\nmountains rise from 10,000 to over 13,000 feet above the sea. Owing to\r\nthe considerable elevation even of the valleys, and the northern\r\nposition of the region here considered, as well as its distance from the\r\nequalizing influence of the sea, the extremes of climate are strongly\r\nmarked. The summer season is comparatively short, and in the valleys the\r\nheat is intense (ranging from 90 deg. to 112 deg. F.) and the rainfall small or\r\nnone at all, while the winter season is cold (temperatures of from -15 deg.\r\nto -30 deg. F. being frequent) and accompanied by an abundant snowfall,\r\nespecially on the mountains. Agriculture, although carried on in the\r\nvalleys, is of comparatively small importance, and is usually dependent\r\non irrigation. The mountains are snow-covered through much of the year,\r\nand small glaciers occur about the lofty summits of the Teton Range and\r\non the mountains near the international boundary and in Canada. The\r\nvalleys are generally destitute of trees except along the\r\nstreams, where white-trunked cottonwoods spread their green leaves in\r\nsummer and become a tracery of golden yellow in the autumn, marking the\r\ncourses of the life-giving waters. The lower mountain slopes are covered\r\nwith dark forests of pine, spruce, and juniper, which increase in\r\ndensity and extent as one follows the ranges northward until the\r\ninfluence of the high northern latitude is felt, and in northern Canada\r\nthe zone of the subarctic forest is reached.\r\n\r\nIn the central part of the Stony Mountains is situated the justly famed\r\nYellowstone National Park, which is truly remarkable for its fine\r\nscenery, its deeply carved and gorgeously colored canyons, and most of\r\nall for its numerous hot springs and spouting geysers. This is the only\r\ngeyser region on the continent, and the most extensive of the three now\r\nexisting in the world.\r\n\r\nThe finest scenery of the northern division of the Rocky Mountain belt\r\nlies to the north of the international boundary, and within recent years\r\nhas been rendered accessible by the building of the Canadian Pacific\r\nRailroad. It is in this region that the mountains are highest, most\r\nrugged, and clothed most completely with the dark, sombre, evergreen\r\nnorthern forests. Here, too, high up among the bare serrate mountain\r\ntops, and mostly above the timber-line, are found the largest of the\r\nglaciers in the Rocky Mountain belt. This wonderful region of rugged\r\nmountains, deep and formerly glacier-filled valleys, impetuous rivers,\r\nand dense forests has only recently become known to the world at large.\r\nVast areas, no doubt as attractive as those about Banff, Lake Louise,\r\nGlacier House, etc., already famous, remain to be discovered and\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nIn the fastnesses of these wild northern Rockies moose, elk, deer, bear,\r\nmountain-sheep, and mountain-goat still abound. The buffalo (bison) is\r\nprotected in the Yellowstone National Park, and will probably be\r\npreserved from extinction. A small herd also survives in Canada. The\r\nstreams, except those flowing from glaciers, are bright, clear, and\r\nswift, and are well stocked with fish. The trout, represented by several\r\nspecies, there finds the cool retreats so essential to its life. To the\r\nsportsman and skilled angler the northern Rockies are a paradise.\r\nAmong the lofty mountains and in the larger valleys there are many\r\nlakes, more especially in northern Idaho and Montana and in Canada. Many\r\nof these, and particularly those near the heads of the valleys and about\r\nthe more lofty peaks, are true rock-basin lakes, worn out by the\r\ngrinding of sand-charged glacial ice when the glaciers were far more\r\nextensive than now. The large lakes situated in the trunk portions of\r\nthe broad-bottomed valleys are in many instances retained by dams of\r\nglacially deposited detritus and record the changes in the aspect of the\r\nland inherited from the Glacial epoch. These numerous lakes present a\r\nvast variety of scenery, and in many instances reflect from their placid\r\nmirror-like surfaces as beautiful and inspiring pictures of rugged\r\ngrandeur as can be found in the world. The natural beauties of the\r\nclassical lakes of Switzerland and Italy are rivalled by many of the\r\ncharming water bodies of the northern Rockies, which but few men\r\nappreciative of the beauties of nature have ever seen.\r\n\r\nTo the south of the Laramie plateau the mountains of the Rocky Mountain\r\nsystem are more irregular and more lofty than those to the north of that\r\nbreak. The many rugged ranges in southern Wyoming, Colorado, and\r\nnorthern New Mexico form a great group, to which the name Park Mountains\r\nhas been applied by J. W. Powell. The several ranges composing this\r\ngroup have a general north and south trend, to which, however, an\r\nexception is furnished by the Uintah Mountains in southwestern Wyoming\r\nand eastern Utah, which consists of a deeply dissected east and west\r\nfold or broadly uplifted plateau. Intervening between several of the\r\nadjacent ranges there are wide, nearly flat-bottomed valleys, which owe\r\ntheir leading characteristics to the deep filling of depressions by\r\n_debris_ carried from the bordering mountains by the wind and streams.\r\nThese broad valleys surrounded by rugged peaks are known as parks, and\r\nthe numerous ranges among which they are situated are hence designated\r\nthe Park Mountains. The term by which the valleys are known is in some\r\nrespects misleading, as the word _park_ usually carries the idea of a\r\ndiversified and in part forested region, with mild, picturesque\r\nscenery. Perhaps a city park or the beautiful rural estates of England\r\nare most usually brought to mind when the term referred to is mentioned.\r\nBut in the great mountains of the central portion of the continent one's\r\nidea must expand to keep in harmony with his surroundings. The natural\r\nparks of that region are broad, generally treeless, valleys with winding\r\nstreams, the uplands are grass-covered and rolling, and in distant views\r\nthe courses of the streams are marked by narrow belts of verdure. The\r\npicture is framed by a succession of mountain domes and embattled\r\ncliffs. Over all arches the dark blue, cloudless sky of a nearly\r\nrainless region. In the clear air distances are deceptive, and what\r\nappear to be miles to the novice must be extended to leagues in order to\r\nacquire adequate conceptions of the magnitude of the scene.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of the great tracts of generally level land surrounded\r\nby the high ranges of the Park Mountains is San Luis Park, situated in\r\nsoutheastern Colorado and extending southward into New Mexico, which has\r\na length from north to south of about 130 miles, and is from 20 to\r\nnearly 40 miles wide. Its general elevation is between 7,000 and 8,000\r\nfeet. This great valley, level-floored with soft deposits swept in from\r\nthe bordering highlands, and almost completely surrounded by rugged\r\nmountains, although more desolate than the majority of the numerous\r\nsimilar valleys in the same region, is typical of its class. The Rio\r\nGrande winds through its entire length and many streams rising in the\r\nbordering mountains flow to the valley during the winter season, but in\r\nsummer, owing to the high temperature, active evaporation, and small\r\nrainfall, only a few of the larger of these mountain-born torrents reach\r\nthe main, southward-flowing river. In the southern portions of the\r\nvalley large areas are covered with drifting sand, which is fashioned by\r\nthe winds into ever-changing dunes of a creamy whiteness. Some of the\r\nstreams from the mountains expand on the plain and form the San Luis\r\nlakes, from which the water escapes by evaporation, thus causing them to\r\nbecome alkaline. The land bordering the lakes is whitened as with\r\nsnow by saline incrustations. On the lower portion of the rim of this\r\nmountain-inclosed basin there are scattered groves of pines and\r\njunipers, and at higher elevations the mountains are dark with forests.\r\nThe more lofty peaks, however, rise far above the upper limit of the\r\nforests and are rugged and magnificent even under the glare of a\r\ncloudless sky.\r\n\r\nTo the east of the San Luis Park, and rising about 7,000 feet over it,\r\nand over 14,000 feet above the sea, stands Sierra Blanca, one of the\r\nfinest of the many majestic mountains of Colorado. In summer immense\r\ncloud banks frequently gather about this cold, isolated peak, and local\r\nstorms, accompanied by fierce lightning and echoing thunder, beat upon\r\nits shrouded sides. These tempests raging on the mountain top, while the\r\nadjacent valleys are flooded with sunlight, recall the scriptural\r\naccounts of the storms of Mount Sinai. In fact, the southwestern portion\r\nof the United States and the adjacent region in Mexico, so far as\r\nscenery and climatic peculiarities are concerned, have much in common\r\nwith Palestine.\r\n\r\nThe other great parks in Colorado, which have suggested a name for the\r\ngroup of mountains in the midst of which they are sheltered, are less\r\narid and less desert-like than the one just described; but like it,\r\nderive their magnificence and fascination from their vast extent, the\r\nsublimity of the bordering mountains, and the wonderful transparency of\r\nthe air above them, rather than from the topography of their nearly\r\nlevel floors or the vegetation that strives ineffectually to clothe\r\ntheir nakedness.\r\n\r\nThe individual summits as well as the separate ranges composing the Park\r\nMountains are remarkable for their massiveness and the great height of\r\ntheir bare rounded summits rather than for picturesque details. Several\r\nof the peaks are among the highest in the United States. One conspicuous\r\nfeature is the considerable elevation of the valleys, usually over 7,000\r\nfeet, and the large number of lofty summits. Of the peaks that have been\r\nmeasured, over 30 exceed 14,000 feet in height. The portion of the Park\r\nMountains above an elevation of 10,000 feet, as is indicated on\r\nthe map reproduced on page 65, is far greater in area than\r\nany other region of similar altitude on the continent.\r\n\r\nIn the Park Mountains, and generally throughout the southern Rockies,\r\neven to central Mexico, the forms that meet the eye are the remnants of\r\nvast upheaved folds and domes of the earth's crust sculptured and\r\ndegraded by erosion. The nearly horizontal rocks of the Great plateaus\r\non meeting the eastern border of the mountains are bent abruptly upward,\r\nand in many places stand on edge or have been overturned so as to dip\r\nwestward. This abrupt upward bending and the presence of remnants of the\r\nsame beds on the summits of some of the higher mountains shows that the\r\nstrata have not been simply folded into anticlinals and synclinals, but\r\nthat there has been a thickening and upswelling of the rocks beneath.\r\n\r\nIn the northern Rockies, except in western Idaho and adjacent portions\r\nof Washington and Oregon, evidences of recent volcanic activity are\r\nrare, although igneous rocks cover great areas, and in the Yellowstone\r\nPark numerous geysers and hot springs bear evidence to the presence of\r\nabnormal heat in the earth's crust. In the southern Rockies, however,\r\nvolcanic mountains which still preserve their forms are numerous in\r\ncertain regions, and in Mexico there are mighty volcanic piles and many\r\nlesser elevations built up by extrusion of molten material, some of\r\nwhich are still active. Examples are furnished of volcanic mountains\r\nranging from perfect cones with curved slopes typical of the forms\r\nproduced by the piling up of various sized fragments about the vents\r\nfrom which they were extruded, to irregular serrate peaks which reveal\r\nthe anatomy of the dissected volcanic masses, and even the dikes which\r\nremain after the surface elevation of a volcano has been removed. The\r\nmost modern volcanoes in this great group of mountains are situated in\r\ncentral Mexico, but others nearly as perfect in form occur in New Mexico\r\nand Arizona, and in the plateaus to the east of the Park Mountains. The\r\nSpanish peaks in southeastern Colorado are instructive illustrations of\r\nthe topographic forms produced when a volcanic mountain has been deeply\r\ndissected.\r\n\r\nIn the formation of volcanic mountains there is an extrusion of molten\r\nand fragmentary material accompanied by an escape of great volumes of\r\nsteam at the surface. Closely related to this phase of vulcanism is the\r\ninjection of molten material into the earth's crust from below, so as to\r\nforce its way between stratified beds and produce intruded sheets. In\r\nthis latter process the sheets of injected material may be thin in\r\ncomparison to their lateral extent or thick lens-shaped masses. In the\r\nproduction of either of these forms of intrusion the cover above the\r\ninjected material is lifted and a change is made in the topography of\r\nthe surface. The intrusions, which are thick in comparison to their\r\nlateral extent, are known as _laccoliths_. At times intrusions of this\r\nnature are of such thickness that they produce true mountain forms. If\r\nunmodified, these elevations would be domes, but when their surfaces are\r\nbroken by erosion and their dissection and removal progresses they\r\nfrequently assume rugged, serrate forms.\r\n\r\nThe type of laccolithic mountains made known some years since by the\r\nstudies of G. K. Gilbert is furnished by the Henry Mountains, in\r\nsouthern Utah. More recently it has been found that this interesting\r\nphase of mountain building is illustrated by many other examples in the\r\nRocky Mountain region and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe rocks exposed at the surface in the southern Rockies, as in the\r\nnorthern division of that great chain, embrace almost every variety\r\nwhich enters into the composition of the earth's crust. The central\r\ncores of many of the now deeply eroded ranges consist of granite and\r\nother similar rocks, and are surrounded by sedimentary beds which range\r\nin age from the oldest stratified rocks now known to the youngest.\r\nIgneous rocks in great variety and in all forms incident to an extruded\r\nor volcanic and intruded or plutonic origin are present. The many\r\ndisturbances that have occurred have led to the formation of mineral\r\nveins and the impregnation of rock masses with ores of various\r\nkinds--such as gold, silver, lead, copper, etc.--which have been mined\r\nwith great success at many localities.\r\n\r\n_The High Plateaus._--To the west and south of the Park Mountains, and\r\nsituated in the western portions of Colorado and New Mexico, eastern and\r\nsouthern Utah, and northern Arizona, there is an extensive region having\r\na general surface level of 6,000 to 7,000 feet above the sea, known as\r\nthe High plateaus. This region has suffered great erosion and is deeply\r\ntrenched by stream-carved canyons. Although not mountainous in the\r\nordinary acceptance of the term, its surface is rugged and difficult to\r\ntraverse, particularly on account of the deep canyons that intersect it\r\nin every direction.\r\n\r\nThe High plateaus are a part of the Rocky Mountain region and bear a\r\nsomewhat similar relation to the Park Mountains that the Alleghany\r\nplateau does to the Appalachian Mountains. Streams flowing westward from\r\nthe Park Mountains and from the southwestern portion of the Stony\r\nMountains unite to form the Colorado River--the one great drainage\r\nchannel of the region. The importance of this remarkable river in the\r\nhistory of the land has led to the adoption of the name Colorado plateau\r\nby Powell and others for the region under consideration. As with so many\r\nof the grander geographical units of the continent, the precise limits\r\nof the one here considered are difficult to define; but in spite of this\r\nuncertainty as to meets and bounds, the now classical writings of\r\nNewberry, Powell, and Dutton especially have shown that a strange and\r\nwonderful land exists in the southwest part of the United States, which\r\nis of unusual interest to geologists and geographers.\r\n\r\nThe High plateaus are underlaid by nearly horizontal rocks. The larger\r\nelements in the structure are great blocks of the earth's crust\r\nmeasuring some 60 to 100 miles on their various borders, which are\r\nbounded by breaks (faults), or by what are termed monoclinal folds or a\r\nchange from one plateau to another by a single bend in the strata. The\r\nrocks in each of the separate plateaus are usually gently tilted. Their\r\neroded edges stand as lines of massive, gorgeously coloured, and\r\nfrequently fantastically sculptured cliffs. These cliffs, when seen from\r\nbelow, appear as rugged mountain ranges, but to an observer standing on\r\ntheir deeply sculptured crests are easily recognised as the\r\nupturned edges of large gently tilted blocks of the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nThe basement rocks beneath the High plateaus are very ancient granites,\r\nschists, etc., which formed a land surface and were greatly eroded\r\nbefore the first of the superimposed stratified beds were deposited upon\r\nthem. The first of the sheets of sediment laid down by the primeval\r\nocean belong to the oldest rocks containing records of life that have as\r\nyet been recognised--the Algonkian (pre-Cambrian) terranes of modern\r\ngeology. Above these come other deposits of sandstone, shales,\r\nlimestone, etc., representing a wide range of geological history, and\r\nincluding as the upper member of the series the sediments of large\r\nTertiary lakes. This vast succession of stratified rocks, some 13,000\r\nfeet in thickness, has been upraised in a broad way, without the\r\ncrumpling and folding, but broken, as stated above, into great blocks\r\nwhich are now variously inclined, but still preserve a plateau-like\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nBesides the movements in the earth's crust which raised the plateaus and\r\ncaused fractures and simple or monoclinal folds in the rocks of which\r\nthey are composed, there occurred volcanic eruptions which produced\r\nnumerous cinder cones, extensive lava-flows, and widely spread sheets of\r\ncomminuted material known as lapilli, dust, and so-called ashes.\r\n\r\nAlthough the history recorded in the rocks forming the High plateaus is\r\none of fascinating geological interest, the easier and more obvious\r\nlesson that the region has to offer, more especially to the geographer,\r\nhas been engraved and etched on its surface by streams and wind-blown\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nOn the High plateaus the rainfall is comparatively small, and the\r\nstreams originating there mostly ephemeral. But on the mountains to the\r\neast and north the precipitation is more abundant and rivers are formed\r\nwhich flow across the plateau region. The Green and Grand Rivers, fed by\r\nmany tributaries, unite to form the Colorado, which flows southwestward\r\nfor some 700 miles and discharges its muddy waters into the Gulf of\r\nLower California. This great river year by year and century after\r\ncentury has deepened its channel through the plateau region where the\r\nrainfall is small, more rapidly than the general surface has been\r\nlowered by erosion. The main conditions are a broad area of nearly\r\nhorizontal rocks, raised high above the sea or above the base level of\r\nerosion, and an arid climate; crossing this region is the ever-flowing\r\nriver, which, acting like an endless saw, cuts deeper and deeper into\r\nthe blocks of the earth's crust which have been raised athwart its\r\ncourse. Resulting from these conditions is a mighty trench or canyon,\r\nwhich is by far the most magnificent of its kind in North America, if\r\nnot in the world. Not only has the main river sunken its channel into\r\nthe earth to a depth of more than a mile throughout a large portion of\r\nits course, but each tributary stream has been engaged for a long period\r\nof time in a similar task. Although most of the streams originating on\r\nthe surface of the plateaus are ephemeral, they work rapidly when the\r\noccasional heavy rains flood their channels. This deepening of the\r\nstream channels, while their borders and the intervening portions of the\r\nplateau surface suffered but comparatively slight erosion, has produced\r\na wonderful system of deep steep-sided trenches in the borders of which\r\nthe edges of the dissected rocks are exposed in nearly vertical\r\nprecipices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Grand Canyon of the Colorado River. After W. H.\r\nHolmes.]\r\n\r\nAside from the lessons of interest to the geologist and geographer so\r\nplainly engraved on the surfaces of the plateaus crossed by the\r\nColorado, the region has a wonderful fascination for the purely aesthetic\r\nfeelings more or less latent in every human breast. To one traversing\r\nthe open pine forests, in places clothing the plateaus and inclosing\r\nmany grassy glades and flower-decked parks, in which timid deer may\r\nfrequently be seen feeding in the early morning, and emerging on the\r\nbrink of the Grand Canyon, the scene that meets the eye is marvellous\r\nbeyond all description. C. E. Dutton, to whom we owe some of the most\r\ngraphic and inspiring descriptions of natural scenery ever written,\r\nstates that those who have long and carefully studied the Grand Canyon of\r\nthe Colorado do not hesitate for a moment in pronouncing it the most\r\nsublime of all earthly spectacles. \"If its sublimity,\" writes\r\nDutton, \"consisted only in its dimensions, it could be sufficiently set\r\nforth in a single sentence. It is more than 200 miles long, from 5 to 12\r\nmiles wide, and from 5,000 to 6,000 feet deep. But it is not magnitude\r\nalone that gives this marvellous canyon its prominence; it is the\r\ngorgeous and varied colouring of its mighty walls, the endless details\r\nin the sculpturing of its battlements and towers, the ever-changing\r\natmospheric effects of its profound depths, and the wonderful stimulus\r\nto the imagination with which it feeds the mind. Standing on the brink\r\nof the Grand Canyon, the prosaic search for causes and effects for a time\r\nat least must be laid aside, and give place to the emotions.\"\r\n\r\nWonderfully grand as are the scenes beheld in traversing this region of\r\nhigh plateaus, with its magnificent cliffs and profound canyons, one is\r\nconstantly reminded that it is an arid land. The higher portions of the\r\nplateau, it is true, are in places forested, but over vast areas the\r\nrocks are bare. Water is everywhere scarce except in the bottom of the\r\nlarger excavations. Thirsty, and perhaps perishing, the traveller,\r\nTantalus like, looks down on the shining silvery threads of water in the\r\ncanyons, hundreds and even thousands of feet below, but separated from\r\nthem by impassable barriers. To the south the plateaus descend to the\r\ndesolate valleys of southern Arizona, where strange gigantic\r\ncactus-plants and scattered clumps of thorny shrubs alone break the\r\ndreary monotony of the hot gravelly deserts. Agriculture is there\r\nimpossible without irrigation, but where the life-giving waters can be\r\nutilized, as in the Gila Valley, marvellous productiveness follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE GREAT BASIN\r\n\r\nTo the west of the Rocky Mountain belt in the United States there exists\r\na region embracing about 210,000 square miles, which sends no stream to\r\nthe ocean. This vast and in large part desert tract is known as the\r\nGreat Basin. The climate is characterized by its aridity. The annual\r\nprecipitation is small and evaporation active. All the water reaching\r\nthe land is returned to the air by evaporation, either directly or from\r\nthe streams and lakes. Many of the lakes do not overflow and are more or\r\nless alkaline and saline, while some of them, as Great Salt Lake, Utah,\r\nand Mono and Owens Lakes, California, are dense with mineral matter in\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--The Great Basin.]\r\n\r\nThe Great Basin is not a single level-floored depression, as one might\r\ninfer from its name, but is traversed by rugged mountain ranges, which\r\ndivide it into a large number of minor valleys. Some of these secondary\r\nbasins have lakes and streams which escape from them into lower\r\ndepressions, but in many instances under present climatic conditions\r\nthey have no surface water, all the moisture that reaches them being\r\nabsorbed by the thirsty soil or evaporated without forming lakes. The\r\nGreat Basin proper, as it may be termed, embraces nearly the whole of\r\nUtah and Nevada, together with small portions of the southern parts of\r\nIdaho and Oregon and a large area in southeastern California. While the\r\ndrainage conditions limit the application of the name to this group of\r\nassociated basins which send no tribute to the sea, the climatic and to\r\na less extent the topographic and geological conditions that\r\ncharacterize it have much wider, although indefinite boundaries. This\r\nwider region which resembles the Great Basin proper, extends from\r\nBritish Columbia southward to beyond the city of Mexico, and includes\r\nthe eastern half of Washington and Oregon, a large part of Idaho, and\r\nmuch of Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas. In this outer region\r\nboth to the north and south of the Great Basin proper there are\r\ndrainless valleys, as those of central Mexico, in which the conditions\r\ncharacteristic of the desert valleys of Utah and Nevada are repeated.\r\n\r\nThe greater region of arid valleys and desolate mountains surrounding\r\nthe Great Basin proper is crossed at the north by the Columbia and in\r\nthe central part by the Colorado. Each of these large rivers has its\r\nsource in the Rocky Mountains and flows to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious features of the Great Basin and of the northward and\r\nsouthward extensions of the belt of country having much in common\r\nwith it, depend on climatic conditions. The rainfall is small throughout\r\nthe entire belt from the Canadian boundary to south-central Mexico. The\r\naverage mean annual precipitation, judging from such observations as are\r\navailable, is probably less than 15 inches, but this broad statement\r\ndoes not truly represent the diverse conditions. The rainfall is\r\nconfined almost entirely to the winter season, and frequently comes in\r\nshort heavy downpours. During the summer season, the valleys especially,\r\nbecome so parched that only such plants can grow as are adapted to\r\nlong-continued droughts. The topography is rough and diversified by many\r\nmountain ranges, and the precipitation is more abundant on the uplands\r\nthan in the valleys. Over large areas in Nevada and southeastern\r\nCalifornia the mean annual rainfall is less than 5 inches. The author,\r\nwhile carrying on geological work in this region, was informed by some\r\nof the older settlers that at times for fully eighteen consecutive\r\nmonths no rain whatever fell in certain of the valleys. From the\r\naccounts of travellers in central Mexico, it seems as if some of the\r\ninterior basins in that region must be fully as arid as those just\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nOne conspicuous result of the lack of moisture is the absence of\r\nforests. Except on the mountains mainly at the north the Great Basin and\r\nits extensions, as defined above, is nearly destitute of trees. The\r\nvalleys are in many instances thickly covered with desert shrubs,\r\nnotably the sage-brush, but the floors of the driest basins are in many\r\ninstances almost absolutely without vegetation, and are frequently white\r\nwith saline incrustations.\r\n\r\nMany of the depressions in the Great Basin, as well as some of the\r\noutlying valleys referred to, have rivers and lakes which exhibit\r\ncertain interesting features that are unfamiliar to people dwelling in\r\nhumid lands. The streams are fed in part by the small precipitation on\r\nthe desert valleys, and by springs, frequently of heated water, but\r\nmainly by the rain and melting snow on the mountains. Many rills and\r\nrivulets are born on the valley sides of a single storm, but are\r\nabsorbed by the thirsty soil or evaporated during the succeeding hours\r\nof sunshine. Other streams have a greater lease of life and flow\r\ndown to valleys and basins, suffering evaporation and absorption as they\r\nprogress, which cause them to diminish in volume, and finally to vanish.\r\nThe stronger streams, such as Sevier and Bear Rivers in Utah, the\r\nHumboldt River in Nevada, and the Truckee River in California, maintain\r\ntheir existence throughout the year, and expand into lakes in which the\r\ninflow is balanced by evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe lakes of the Great Basin present even greater diversity than the\r\nstreams. Some of those situated principally in the mountains are of\r\npure, limpid, wholesome water, supplied by cool, sweet brooks and rills\r\nor by the melting of the winter's snows, and overflow throughout the\r\nyear. These lakes, usually of small size, are similar in all respects to\r\nthe ordinary lakes of humid lands. In eastern Utah, adjacent to the west\r\nbase of the Wasatch Mountains, the Provo River and other streams supply\r\nUtah Lake, the outlet of which, the Jordan River, empties into Great\r\nSalt Lake. Utah Lake is well within the Great Basin, and situated at a\r\nlow elevation for the region, namely, 4,500 feet, or about 280 feet (in\r\n1873) above the level of lake of brine into which it discharges. This is\r\nthe largest of the fresh lakes in the valleys of the Great Basin, and\r\nowes its existence to the fact that a depression there occurs which is\r\nfilled to overflowing by the streams from the mountains. Bear Lake, in\r\nnortheastern Utah, is another exceptional example of a fresh lake of\r\nconsiderable size at a comparatively low altitude, in the same region.\r\nOn the western rim of the Great Basin, at an elevation of 6,247 feet,\r\nand surrounded by the forested peaks of the Sierra Nevada, lies Lake\r\nTahoe, \"the gem of the Sierra,\" a water body of remarkable purity, which\r\ndischarges through Truckee River into Pyramid and Winnemucca Lakes.\r\nThese lower lakes, situated in desert valleys at an elevation of 3,780\r\nfeet above the sea, are without outlets and alkaline and bitter. The\r\nmost characteristic lakes of the Great Basin, however, are those that do\r\nnot overflow, and on account of concentration by evaporation are more or\r\nless highly charged with mineral matter in solution. These saline and\r\nalkaline lakes may be divided into two classes, in reference to\r\ntheir duration, but the line of separation is indefinite. Certain of\r\nthem have maintained their existence for many years, and probably have\r\nnot been evaporated to dryness for several centuries, and may be classed\r\nas perennial lakes; others are evaporated to dryness each year, or\r\nduring certain exceptionally dry and hot seasons, and may be termed\r\nephemeral lakes. In many instances the beds of the ephemeral lakes are\r\nnormally in a state of desiccation, and appear as broad, level, mud\r\nplains, usually with a white fringe of saline matter. Frequently these\r\nmud plains, or _playas_, as they are termed, are transformed into\r\nshallow lakes during a single storm, but the waters are absorbed by the\r\nclays beneath or evaporated within a few days or perhaps a few hours\r\nafter the rain ceases. The largest and most characteristic of the\r\nperennial saline water bodies is Great Salt Lake, the counterpart in\r\nmany ways of the Dead Sea. The streams discharging into this salt sea\r\nhave the usual purity of river-waters, and carry but a small fraction of\r\none per cent of saline matter in solution. The lake is supplied also in\r\npart, but to an unimportant extent, by springs, the most of which are of\r\nessentially fresh water. The source of the salts which make the waters\r\nof the lake a brine is evidently, therefore, the small percentage of\r\nmineral material brought in by the tributary streams. After reaching the\r\nlake these fresh waters, in the ordinary meaning of the term, are\r\nconcentrated by evaporation. This is the explanation of the leading\r\nfacts in the chemistry of all of the saline and alkaline lakes of the\r\nGreat Basin region, such as Pyramid, Winnemucca, and Walker Lakes in\r\nNevada, Mono and Owens Lakes in California, and the saline lakes of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nThe volume of a lake without an outlet, or an \"inclosed lake,\" is\r\ndetermined mainly by the ratio of the inflow (including the rain falling\r\ndirectly on its surface and the tribute from springs) and evaporation.\r\nIts volume, and consequently its area, fluctuates from season to season,\r\nand frequently varies also during periods embracing several years. With\r\nvariations in volume there are fluctuations in the percentage of saline\r\nmatter in solution, even if precipitation of one or more of the\r\ncontained salts does not take place during the periods of more than\r\nusual concentration. In most instances inclosed lakes are concentrated\r\nby evaporation in summer seasons, and perhaps become nearly saturated\r\nsolutions, but are diluted during the rainy winter seasons. Fluctuations\r\nin volume, area, depth, salinity, etc., are thus characteristic of\r\ninclosed water bodies. They are sensitive to climatic changes which\r\nordinary weather records fail to detect, and are modified in a\r\nconspicuous manner when the country about them becomes inhabited and\r\nirrigation is practised.\r\n\r\nSome of the lakes of the Great Basin are dense brines from which various\r\nsubstances are being precipitated. The economic importance of these\r\nnatural reservoirs of brine and of various soda salts is great, and will\r\nbecome more and more important as transportation facilities increase.\r\nGreat Salt Lake, it has been estimated, contains 400,000,000 tons of\r\ncommon salt and 30,000,000 tons of sodium sulphate in solution. During\r\nthe past ten years about 40,000 tons of common salt have been harvested\r\nfrom it annually. Mono Lake contains some 245,000,000 tons of saline\r\nmatter in solution, of which about 92,000,000 tons are sodium carbonate\r\nand bicarbonate. Owens Lake is similar to Mono Lake in composition, and\r\nis now the basis of a large soda industry.\r\n\r\nA marked difference between a region which drains to the ocean and one\r\nwhere the streams enter inclosed basins where their waters are\r\nevaporated is that in the former the waste from the land carried by the\r\nstreams as an invisible load in solution or as a visible load consisting\r\nmainly of silt and sand in suspension is contributed to the ocean and\r\nwidely distributed before being deposited--much of the material in\r\nsolution, in fact, may be said to be a permanent contribution to the\r\nsalinity of sea-water; but in most instances where streams enter\r\ninclosed basins all of the material contributed both in solution and\r\nsuspension is sooner or later precipitated. The area within an inclosed\r\nbasin, on which the inflowing streams lay down their loads, is as a rule\r\nless extensive than the area that is being denuded to supply the\r\nmaterial. The receiving basins are thus filled in or _aggraded_, and\r\nthere is a concentration both of the mechanical wash from the land and\r\nof the substances taken in solution by the waters of streams and\r\nsprings. A marked result of this process of concentration, particularly\r\nof the fine waste of the uplands and mountains, is seen in the\r\napproximately level floors of inclosed valleys. Throughout the Great\r\nBasin the valleys have been filled to a depth in many instances of\r\nhundreds of feet. Some of the lower mountain ranges in Utah have been so\r\nnearly buried beneath these valley deposits that only their summits,\r\ntermed _lost mountains_, appear above the even surface of the desert\r\nplains. This _debris_, deeply filling the valleys referred to, is\r\nusually a fine yellowish dust-like material, similar in many ways, and\r\nprobably in mode of origin, to the _loess_ of China in which geologists\r\nhave taken much interest. With the concentration and deposition of the\r\nfine mechanical wash of the uplands there has also been a concentration\r\nof the more soluble saline constituents of rocks, which causes the soils\r\nof arid regions to differ in an important way from those of humid lands.\r\nThe leached and characteristically red-tinted soils of warm humid\r\ncountries, consisting of the oxidized residue of deeply weathered rocks,\r\nare absent from arid regions; in their place we find minutely\r\ndisintegrated, usually light-coloured, and not chemically impoverished\r\nsoils. In warm humid regions chemical decay of the rocks is the\r\nconspicuous feature; in equally warm arid lands mechanical\r\ndisintegration is carried to an extreme, without the removal of the more\r\nsoluble constituents. In fact, concentration of saline matter, notably\r\ncommon salt, sodium sulphate, gypsum, etc., is one of the functions, so\r\nto speak, of arid climates, when the requisite evaporation basins are\r\npresent. Among the important industries of the Great Basin region is the\r\ngathering and purifying of the various salts contained in the existing\r\nwater bodies and in the basins of desiccated lakes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the characteristics of the region referred to above,\r\nwhich are mainly the result of climatic conditions, the Great Basin has\r\ncertain geological features, in the main, so far as North America\r\nis concerned, peculiar to itself. The leading structural features of the\r\nrocks, so far as they find expression in the surface relief, is the\r\npresence of a large number of extensive faults trending in general about\r\nnortheast and southwest. These faults are breaks or cracks along which\r\nthe rocks have been moved up and down. One side of a fault sometimes\r\nstands higher than the opposite side, and forms a narrow and frequently\r\nhigh and rugged mountain range. The number of these faults within the\r\nGreat Basin is as yet unknown, but they certainly number many hundreds.\r\nIn a cross profile of the region between the Wasatch Mountains on the\r\neast and the Sierra Nevada on the west the number of mountain ridges due\r\nto faulting is at least a score. The precipitous western border of the\r\nWasatch Mountains is itself a great fault scarp, as is also the eastern\r\nborder of the Sierra Nevada. The faults that determine the steeper sides\r\nof these mountain ranges are not to be considered as single clean-cut\r\ngashes, but as irregular and intersecting fractures traversing a narrow\r\nbelt of country. The faults referred to divide rocks of all ages, and\r\nare evidently due to the most recent disturbances that have affected the\r\nregion. It is not probable that the break in any given instance was\r\nformed all at once. Such vast convulsions would be out of harmony with\r\nthe rules of nature. But rather many small movements and adjustments of\r\npressure have occurred along the same belt of fracture. This conclusion\r\nis sustained by the fact that many of the faults have experienced\r\nmovements in very recent times. In places fault scarps a score or more\r\nfeet in height cross the alluvial cones at the mouths of the small\r\nhigh-grade valleys in the mountains. These scarps in loose\r\nunconsolidated gravel and similar material, even under an arid climate,\r\ncould not be expected to preserve their freshness for many years. At\r\ntimes the breaks cross the courses of streams and cascades, and rapids\r\nare formed by the waters flowing down escarpments thus produced in loose\r\nmaterial. One characteristic fault scarp in Inyo Valley, California, is\r\nknown to have been formed during an earthquake that shook that portion\r\nof the country in 1872. The many small earthquakes that have been\r\nfelt in the Great Basin region are believed to have been caused by\r\nslight movements along the breaks that traverse the region. This and\r\nother evidence indicates that the faults to which so much of the\r\ncharacteristic scenery of the Great Basin is due have grown by repeated\r\nminor displacements, and that such movements are a common cause of\r\nearthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous topographic features of the better known portion of\r\nthe Great Basin are long, narrow, and frequently sharp-crested ridges,\r\nwith a gentle slope on one side and a steep escarpment on the other. The\r\nsteeper side in a large number of instances is known to be the upraised\r\nside of a fault. Each of these basin ranges, as they are termed, may be\r\nconsidered as the upturned edge of a block of the earth's crust, in\r\ngeneral from 60 to 100 or more miles long, and 10 to perhaps 20 miles\r\nwide. The crest-lines of the tilted blocks are frequently serrate, on\r\naccount of differences in the hardness and texture of the rocks and the\r\neffects of weathering. There is frequently, however, an older structure\r\nrevealed in them, showing that the region was folded and otherwise\r\ndisturbed previous to the later movements which produced the leading\r\nfeatures in the present topography. It is probable that this older\r\nstructure in some instances has had an important bearing on the forms of\r\nsome of the ranges, but our knowledge in this direction is too limited\r\nto warrant presentation in a popular treatise.\r\n\r\nMany of the basin ranges are imposing on account of their height and\r\nruggedness, when seen from the adjacent, deeply filled valleys, although\r\nscarcely more than half of their actual elevation above the sea is\r\nrevealed from such points of view. Exceptions to this general statement\r\noccur, however, in southeastern California, where, in Death Valley, the\r\nland is 480 feet below sea-level. This is the only region in North\r\nAmerica which, like the basin of the Dead Sea, is below the level of the\r\nocean's surface. On the border of Death Valley the mountain ranges rise\r\nfrom 6,000 to 10,000 feet, and the highest summit, known as Telescope\r\nPeak, is reported to have an elevation of nearly 11,000 feet\r\nabove the sea. In the central and northern portions of the Great Basin\r\nthe valley floors have a general elevation of from 5,000 to 6,000 feet.\r\nThe mountains rise from these valleys to a height of from a few hundred\r\nto 4,000 or 5,000 feet. Among the highest, if not actually the\r\nculminating peaks well within the Great Basin are White Mountain, on the\r\nCalifornia-Nevada boundary, about 30 miles southeast of Mono Lake, which\r\nhas a summit elevation of 13,000 feet, and Jeff Davis Peak, in eastern\r\nNevada, which rises 13,100 feet above the sea and 8,000 feet above the\r\nadjacent valleys.\r\n\r\nThe numerous sharp-crested ranges of the region under review are\r\nfrequently remarkable for the richness of the colours of the naked\r\nrocks. The mountain slopes and towering angular summits when outlined\r\nagainst the morning or evening sky are frequently as brilliantly dyed as\r\nare the New England hills when clothed in the harlequin foliage of\r\nautumn. Before sunrise and after sunset each serrate crest-line is the\r\nsharply cut border of a silhouette of the deepest and richest purple.\r\nThe diversity of scenery in the Great Basin is increased by mountains of\r\nvolcanic origin, including several modern craters, some of which hold\r\nlakes, and by lava-flows of recent date, and by great alluvial fans or\r\ndetritus cones which stream out into the valleys from the mouths of\r\ngorges in the bordering mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Great Basin proper, with its rugged topography and arid climate, is\r\nnot an agricultural region. Small portions of it, however, when water\r\ncan be had for irrigation, have been transformed into fruitful farms and\r\ngardens which yield bountiful returns. But even a century hence, when\r\nall has been accomplished in the way of reclaiming the arid valleys that\r\ncan be done by utilizing the available water for irrigation, only a\r\nsmall per cent of the whole will be under cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SIERRA NEVADA AND CASCADE MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nTo the west of the Great Basin, and extending from southern California\r\nnorthward to beyond the United States-Canadian boundary, there is a\r\nlofty and extremely rugged belt of mountains consisting of two\r\nranges--the Sierra Nevada at the south and the Cascade Mountains at the\r\nnorth. Topographically, these two ranges form a single elevated belt of\r\ncountry, but custom, and as is now generally understood the geological\r\nstructure and history, draws a dividing line between them in northern\r\nCalifornia. The Sierra Nevada-Cascade range extends far into Canada, and\r\nis there known as the Coast Range. No adjustment of the nomenclature in\r\nuse on the two sides of the international boundary has been made, and in\r\norder to conform with current usage, it is necessary to consider\r\nseparately the two portions of the range on opposite sides of the\r\nforty-ninth parallel.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Nevada has its southern terminus at Tejon Pass, in southern\r\nCalifornia, and extending from there northward to Lassen Peak, in the\r\nnorthern part of the same State. With the exception of a small area to\r\nthe east and north of Lake Tahoe, the entire range is included within\r\nthe boundaries of California. This is geographically one of the best\r\ndefined of the larger mountain ranges in the United States. Its eastern\r\nborder especially is easy to trace, as for the most part it is\r\ndetermined by a great escarpment, corresponding to the fault scarp which\r\nborders one side of so many of the basin ranges. The Sierra Nevada, in\r\nfact, may be considered as one of the basin ranges of great size and\r\nforming the western wall of the region of interior drainage lying to the\r\neastward. This abrupt eastward-facing mountain slope is in reality a\r\ngreat fault scarp, formed mainly by the upheaval of the west side of an\r\nintersecting system of fractures. It is not known, however, how much of\r\nthe escarpment is due to the upheaval of the west side of the belt of\r\nfracture, or how much to the sinking of the eastern side. There have no\r\ndoubt been many up and down movements along this belt, of which\r\nthe present mountain wall is the algebraic sum. The escarpment rises in\r\ngeneral from 5,000 to 6,000 feet above the desert valleys to the\r\neastward, and reaches a maximum of about 14,000 feet in the vicinity of\r\nDeath Valley. It is exceedingly precipitous and rises to an irregular\r\nserrate crest-line, from which the general slope westward to the Great\r\nValley of California is gentle.\r\n\r\nThe best idea of the generalized topographic form as well as of the\r\norigin of the Sierra Nevada, which the reader may be asked to hold in\r\nmind, is that the range consists of a block of the earth's crust about\r\n500 miles long and from 70 to 100 miles broad, which has been upraised\r\nalong its eastern edge so as to give its surface a westward inclination.\r\nFrom this vast monolith the profound canyons and multitude of sharp\r\ntapering spires which give to the range its magnificent scenery have\r\nbeen sculptured. Like most generalized pictures of great geographical\r\nfeatures, however, this outline of the form and structure of the great\r\nmountain range of California has to be modified when studied in detail.\r\nFrom extensive and most painstaking studies by H. W. Turner, of the\r\nUnited States Geological Survey, the conclusion is reached that \"the\r\nSierra Nevada may be described as a monogenetic range, composed of\r\nhighly compressed schists and slates with large areas of associated\r\nigneous rocks, chiefly granite and diabase, upon which lie uncomfortably\r\na series of later Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments and volcanic rocks.\"\r\n\r\nCould the profound valleys carved in the long western slope of the\r\nSierra Nevada be filled so as to restore the conditions as they existed\r\nwhen the mountain block was first upraised and tilted, we would have an\r\ninclined plane in which the edges of previously folded rocks would be\r\nexposed. In other words, the western slope is a tilted peneplain,\r\nbearing on its surface remnants of older uplands. High up on the range\r\nthere are detached areas of well-worn gravel, which were deposited when\r\nthe slopes were less inclined than at present, and before the existing\r\npeaks and canyons came into existence. Certain of the valleys carved\r\nduring a portion of the earlier stage of erosion were subsequently\r\nfilled by lava-floods, which buried gold-bearing gravel beneath thick\r\nlayers of basaltic rock. Erosion has since cut away the softer beds\r\nbordering these ancient lava-sheets, and left them in bold relief as\r\ntable mountains, underneath which miners have excavated tunnels in order\r\nto reach the stream-deposited gravels of the ancient canyons. In these\r\ninstances valleys have been changed to uplands, owing to the resistance\r\nto erosion afforded by the volcanic rocks discharged into them.\r\n\r\nThe long gentle slope on the west side of the Sierra Nevada has been\r\ndissected by westward-flowing rivers, which have sunk their channels\r\n2,000 or 3,000 feet or more into the rocks. Other streams having much\r\nshorter courses flow down the steep eastern slope of the range and have\r\nalso excavated canyons. These two systems of drainage, one leading\r\nwestward to the Great Valley of California and the other eastward to the\r\nvalleys of the Great Basin, extended their head branches until they came\r\ninto rivalry with each other, and cut deep notches in the crest of the\r\nrange. During a late stage in its history the higher portions of the\r\nmountains were covered with a great field of perennial snow, from which\r\nglaciers flowed both eastward and westward. These ice-streams, by\r\ndeepening and broadening the previously water-cut channels, still\r\nfurther increased the diversity of the topography and impressed upon it\r\ncharacteristics such as only glaciers can produce.\r\n\r\nThe highest and most typical part of the Sierra Nevada is in its\r\nsouth-central portion, and is known as the High Sierra. This region,\r\nalthough at present not accurately defined, is well worthy of\r\nrecognition. Throughout its entire extent, from the neighbourhood of\r\nLake Tahoe on the north to Tehichipe Pass at the south, a distance of\r\nabout 240 miles, it is diversified by rugged serrate peaks and narrow\r\nstream-cut valleys of great depth. Many of the mountains attain\r\nelevations of from 12,000 to over 13,500 feet. The highest summit is\r\nMount Whitney, in the southern part of the range and near its eastern\r\nborder, which rises 14,522 feet above the sea and has the added\r\ndistinction of being the highest mountain in the United States,\r\nexclusive of Alaska. It is a notable fact that this great mountain-peak\r\nshould be situated only about 100 miles from Death Valley, the lowest\r\ndepression on the continent.\r\n\r\nAnother of the remarkable features of the Sierra Nevada is the great\r\ndepth and the wonderfully precipitous walls of some of the valleys\r\ncarved by the westward-flowing rivers. The most famous of these is the\r\nsublime Yosemite Valley, now world-renowned. This cleft as it appears in\r\nsolid light-coloured granite, over a mile deep, is believed by Turner,\r\nthe last of several geologists to discuss its origin, to be due to\r\nstream erosion. The fact seems well established, however, that glacial\r\nice has assisted in the great task. The Yosemite is not such an unique\r\nfeature as was at one time supposed, but is approached if not equalled\r\nin depth and magnificence by Hetch Hetchy Valley, through which flows\r\nthe Tuolumne River, and is duplicated, in part at least, by other\r\nsimilar stream-cut gulfs.\r\n\r\nAmong the chief elements in the glorious scenery of the Sierra Nevada is\r\nthe multitude of lakes left as a rich inheritance by the departed\r\nglaciers. These occur not only high up amid the bare peaks where their\r\nbasins were excavated by the flowing ice, but also in the lower valleys\r\nwhere the ancient ice-streams built morainal dams.\r\n\r\nThe High Sierra was swept nearly clean of soil and _debris_ by the\r\nancient glaciers, and the hard rocks thus exposed were rounded and\r\nburnished by the ice that flowed over them. But little disintegration or\r\ndecay of the rocks has taken place since an amelioration of climate\r\nchanged the drainage from a solid to a liquid form. On account mainly of\r\nthe general absence of soil the forests are less dense than might be\r\nexpected from the height of the regions where they occur and its general\r\nclimatic conditions. The more lofty peaks reach far above the forests\r\nand are riven and shattered by frost. The crests and cliffs at somewhat\r\nlower altitudes are also bare, but in the canyons and on the meadow-like\r\nvalley bottoms smoothed by the glaciers, open park-like groves of pine\r\nand spruce grow in picturesque disorder. On the ledges of the great\r\nprecipices, and on many of the secondary summits, gardens of\r\nalpine flowers blossom in late summer, and at times impart a rich warm\r\nglow to the heights that support them. The views of nature, unmarred by\r\nthe hand of man, which reward the persistent mountaineer in this silent\r\nwonderland of the upper world, are not only grand beyond all\r\ndescription, but beautified by a delicacy of decoration where\r\nsnow-fields and alpine gardens meet, that is undreamed of by the\r\ndwellers in the denser air of the plains and seaside. Lovers of nature\r\nwho are unable to climb the towering summits of the High Sierra and see\r\nfor themselves the marvellous beauty there so lavishly displayed can at\r\nleast find a glowing pen picture of it in John Muir's fascinating book\r\nThe Mountains of California. On the lower western slope of the Sierra\r\nNevada the forests become continuous and luxuriant, the trees are of\r\nlarge size, and the lovely flowers carpeting the valleys and hillsides\r\ntake on a more familiar appearance than the gorgeous blossoms of the\r\nalpine meadows. It is in this region that the gigantic _Sequoia_ still\r\nlingers as a remnant of a nearly extinct flora.\r\n\r\nStatements of heights and depths, of geological structures, and of\r\ntopographic forms are perhaps necessary to enable one to form a mental\r\npicture of a snow-crowned mountain range which will bear some faint\r\nresemblance to the mighty original; but when one threads his way through\r\nthe resinous forests on the lower slopes of the Sierra Nevada, ascends\r\nsome one of the profound water-cut rifts in its side, scales the steep\r\ncliffs, traverses the crystal surfaces of the small glaciers, and\r\nfinally stands on a spire-like summit covered only by the dark blue of\r\nthe dome above, all thoughts of the arches and walls that support the\r\nmighty cathedral are lost in wrapt wonder and admiration of the\r\nmagnificent scene about him. It is this intense feeling for the sublime\r\nand beautiful in nature that the student of geography should strive to\r\ncultivate, as well as to acquire skill in reading the prosaic history\r\nwritten everywhere on the mountains. This important lesson can seldom be\r\nstudied to greater advantage than amid the silent awe-inspiring peaks of\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThe Cascade Mountains, as previously stated, are a direct continuation,\r\nso far as the relief is concerned, of the Sierra Nevada. The geological\r\nstructure of the region in northern California, where the two ranges\r\napproach each other, has been studied by J. S. Diller, of the United\r\nStates Geological Survey, who concludes that they present characteristic\r\ndifferences. In the Cascade Mountains in northern California, Oregon,\r\nand southern Washington the rocks exposed at the surface are mainly, if\r\nnot entirely, of volcanic origin, and were poured out in a molten\r\ncondition as lava-flows, or as fragmental ejections from volcanoes, and\r\nin part rose through fissures and formed what are termed fissure\r\neruptions. The rocks thus extruded are mainly composed of dark, heavy\r\nbasic material, such as basalt and andesite. These outpourings of molten\r\nrocks were on a grand scale, and a large number of volcanic mountains\r\nwere formed which still remain as the dominant peaks of the rugged and\r\ndensely forested Cascade Range. Although the evidence now available\r\nseems to show that there is a striking difference between the Sierra\r\nNevada and the Cascade Mountains, another significant change occurs when\r\none follows the Cascade Mountains into northern Washington. Where the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railroad crosses the range the volcanic rocks are\r\nsucceeded northward by granites, schists, serpentine, etc., and\r\nCretaceous and Tertiary sedimentary beds of much the same character as\r\nthose in the Sierra Nevada.\r\n\r\nThe study of the Sierra Nevada-Cascade region has not progressed far\r\nenough to warrant a decision, but the fact referred to above strongly\r\nsuggests that the two ranges, as we now term them, are essentially a\r\nsingle uplift, a large portion of which, extending from Lassen Peak, in\r\nCalifornia, northward across Oregon and into Washington as far as the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railroad, is buried beneath a great blanket, so to\r\nspeak, of lava-flows. The tract of elevated and rugged country in\r\nnorthern Washington embraced in the Cascade Mountains, as has been\r\nobserved by the writer, passes into Canada without a marked change in\r\neither its geology or geography, and there is no occasion for a\r\nchange of name when the international boundary is crossed.\r\n\r\nThe Cascade Mountains in Oregon and southern Washington, where the\r\nsurface rocks are mainly and perhaps wholly of volcanic origin, are\r\nrugged for two principal reasons: First, volcanic energy has built up\r\ngreat individual peaks; and second, erosion has carved deep valleys and\r\nnumerous ravines and gorges. The volcanoes are now extinct, or have long\r\nbeen dormant, and their cold summits are in several instances crowned\r\nwith perennial snow and small glaciers. The forms given to the more\r\nprominent elevations by the eruptions which built them have to a great\r\nextent been defaced by erosion. As they stand to-day they furnish an\r\ninstructive series of more or less deeply dissected volcanic mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Crater Lake in the summit of Mount Mazama,\r\nOregon.]\r\n\r\nNot only has erosion changed the characteristic slopes of the peaks\r\nbuilt of lava-flows and ejected fragments, but in at least one\r\nremarkable instance the volcanic energy itself greatly altered the\r\nstructure it had previously raised. Mount Mazama, situated in southern\r\nOregon in the summit region of the Cascades, is a truncated volcanic\r\ncone in the top of which there is an immense depression now partially\r\nfilled by the waters of Crater Lake (Fig. 21). The main features in the\r\nhistory of this unique mountain with a lake in its summit, as\r\ninterpreted by Messrs. Dutton and Diller, of the United States\r\nGeographical Survey, are as follows: It once stood as a conical peak,\r\nsimilar to several other mountains of volcanic origin in the same\r\nregion, some 15,000 feet in height; it was then an active volcano with a\r\nsummit crater filled with lava, but subsequently, for a time at least,\r\nbecame dormant and was occupied by glacial ice. At a later period an\r\nescape for the lava was furnished by a fissure or other opening which\r\nadmitted of a surface discharge at a more or less distant locality, in a\r\nmanner similar to the escape of the molten rocks from the great\r\nvolcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands within historic times. This drawing\r\noff of the lava from the crater removed the support afforded its walls\r\nfrom within, and the summit portion of the mountain, embracing about\r\nthree-fourths of its height above the adjacent valleys, fell in\r\nand was engulfed. The mountain was thus truncated, and presents the\r\ngeneral appearance of similar cones the upper portions of which are\r\nknown to have been blown away by explosions. But in the case of Mount\r\nMazama, the hypothesis of truncation by explosion seems to be disproved\r\nby the absence of the fragments of the portion removed on the slopes\r\nremaining or on the surrounding region. After the falling in of the\r\nsummit of the mountain comparatively mild volcanic explosions followed\r\nwhich built a cone within the great pit or _caldera_ in the summit of\r\nthe truncated mountain, but without filling it. The space left vacant is\r\nnow occupied by water, and thus transformed into a lake. The cone built\r\nafter the catastrophe referred to now forms Wizard Island, near the\r\nsouthwest border of Crater Lake.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the magnitude of the changes wrought in Mount Mazama by the\r\nevents recorded in its geology and topography may be obtained from the\r\nfollowing facts: Crater Lake has a surface elevation of 6,239 feet above\r\nthe sea, and is nearly 2,000 feet deep in its deepest part; the\r\nprecipices surrounding it are from 520 to 1,987 feet high. The whole\r\ndepth of the depression is therefore 4,000 feet. This _caldera_, as such\r\nbasins of volcanic origin are termed, is nearly circular, with an east\r\nand west diameter measuring 6 miles, and a north and south diameter of 5\r\nmiles. The volume of the pit is nearly 12 cubic miles.\r\n\r\nNot only is Mount Mazama with its wonderful lake one of the most unique\r\nnatural features of North America, but it has its full share of the\r\nartistic details of lake and mountain scenery which appeal so forcibly\r\nto the finer instincts within us. The outer slopes of the mountain are\r\nclothed with the all-embracing coniferous forests which cover the\r\nCascades as with a mantle throughout their entire extent, while the\r\nprecipitous inner slopes are for the most part bare precipices of\r\nangular and extremely rugged rock. The lake itself is of the most\r\nmarvellous blue, in which the encircling cliffs, the crater-island, and\r\nthe sky above are reflected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Mount Rainier, Washington.]\r\n\r\nOther peaks along the crest-line of the Cascades to be numbered by the\r\nscore, although with less romantic histories than Mount Mazama,\r\nhave instructive answers to give when properly questioned. Among the\r\nremarkably picturesque summits rising above the dark coniferous forests\r\nof western Oregon are the following, with their respective heights above\r\nthe sea expressed in feet: Mount Pitt, 9,760; Mount Mazama, 8,228; Mount\r\nUnion, 7,881; Mount Scott, 7,123; Three Sisters, Mount Jefferson,\r\n10,200; and Mount Hood, 11,225. Of these peaks, the best known, on\r\naccount of its proximity to the city of Portland, and at the same time\r\none of the most picturesque and beautiful, is Mount Hood, situated about\r\n25 miles south of the Columbia River. The concave slopes so\r\ncharacteristic of volcanic cones are no longer conspicuous on the sides\r\nof this once symmetrical mountain, and only remnants of its crater\r\nremain. The part it played as a safety-valve for the pent-up energy\r\nbeneath was long since finished, although heated vapours still escape\r\nfrom an opening near the summit. Similar manifestations of heat have\r\nalso been observed about several other ancient craters in the Cascades,\r\nbut these occurrences are not considered as indicating that actual\r\nconnections still exist with reservoirs or bodies of molten rocks below\r\nthe surface: they are evidently due to the residual heat of the once\r\nmolten rock in the conduits of the now extinct or dormant volcanoes.\r\n\r\nThe lava-flows and volcanic mountains typically displayed in the\r\nCascades throughout the breadth of Oregon continue northward and form at\r\nleast the surface portion of the same range in Washington as far as the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railroad, or about 100 miles north of the Columbia. The\r\nmore important volcanic mountains in western Washington are, in their\r\norder from south to north; as follows, the height of each being given in\r\nfeet: Mount Adams, 9,570; Mount St. Helens, 9,750; Mount Rainier,\r\n14,525; Glacier Peak, 10,436; and Mount Baker, 10,877. Only two of these\r\nancient volcanoes, namely, Mount Adams and Glacier Peak, are situated on\r\nthe crest-line of the Cascade Mountains; the others are to the westward\r\nand more or less completely detached from the main range.\r\n\r\nThe Cascade Mountains are in general parallel with the shore of the\r\nPacific, and rise as a prominent barrier athwart the path of the\r\nprevailing westerly winds. Precipitation on their seaward slopes is\r\ncopious, but their landward sides overlooking the arid plains of central\r\nWashington are far less humid. The westward, or rainy slope, is clothed\r\nwith a magnificent forest of giant trees, while the eastward, or sunny\r\nside, is largely without forests, but abounds in natural meadows and\r\npastures. Large portions of the mountains are still almost entirely\r\nunknown, and retain their primitive wildness, except that forest fires,\r\nparticularly near the international boundary, have in places made\r\ndesolate the once beautiful valleys and precipitous slopes. Elk, deer,\r\nbear, the mountain-goat, and mountain-sheep still roam the forests. The\r\nlarge streams abound in salmon, and each cool, clear brook and rushing\r\ncreek is a favourite haunt of the trout. No more delightful\r\ncamping-ground for lovers of nature and searchers for recreation can be\r\nfound than the grassy, park-like valleys on the sunny side of these\r\nmagnificent mountains.\r\n\r\nMany of the details in the scenery of the Cascades are due to the work\r\nof ancient glaciers. Numerous lakes, held in rock-basins in the higher\r\nportions of the mountains, and many still larger sheets of water\r\nretained by morainal dams in the lower valleys, give a superlative charm\r\nto many a wild and rugged landscape. The largest and most interesting\r\nlake in the entire Cascade region is Lake Chelan, situated in a deep\r\nvalley on the eastern side of the mountains in north-central Washington.\r\nThis beautiful sheet of water, a mile or two wide, extending like a\r\nplacid river for some 70 miles into the mountains, resembles in many of\r\nits features the far-famed lakes of northern Italy. The mountains\r\ninclosing this hidden gem of the Cascades rise abruptly from the water's\r\nedge to great heights, and with one exception are unbroken by deep\r\nside-valleys. For fully 50 miles the blue plain of water is overshadowed\r\non each side by crags and precipices from 5,000 to 6,000 or more feet in\r\nheight. The lower slopes are dark with forests of pine and fir, and the\r\nbare serrate spires above are white with snow long after the\r\nspring flowers have faded in the lower vales. The water of the lake is\r\nclear and sparkling, and has the deep-blue colour of the open ocean. The\r\nsounding-line has shown a depth of 1,400 feet, and the bottom is about\r\n300 feet below sea-level. This wonderful lake, clasped in the embrace of\r\nthe eastward extended arms of the Cascades, is but 2 or 3 miles from the\r\nColumbia River, into which it discharges its surplus waters through\r\nChelan River, and may be easily reached from Wenachee, on the Great\r\nNorthern Railroad, by steamers on the Columbia. Although at present\r\nscarcely known to the world of tourists, Lake Chelan is destined to take\r\nas an important place in the lives of those who seek rest and recreation\r\nas does Lake George in northern New York at the present day.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to trace the Pacific mountains northward through\r\nCanada and Alaska, let us glance at the leading geographical features to\r\nthe west of the Sierra Nevada-Cascade uplift.\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE GREAT VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE PUGET SOUND BASIN\r\n\r\nTo the west of the Sierra Nevada-Cascade Mountains, and bordered on the\r\nwest by another and very nearly parallel series of elevations, known in\r\na general way as the Coast Mountains, there is a succession of long,\r\nrelatively narrow basins, situated end to end, and constituting what may\r\nbe termed a valley-chain. This series of basins extends from southern\r\nCalifornia northward far into Canada, and includes, in their order from\r\nsouth to north, the great Valley of California, the Willamette and\r\nCowlitz Valleys in Oregon and Washington, and the Puget Sound basin,\r\ntogether with its great but indefinitely defined northward extension.\r\n\r\nThe Great Valley of California has a length of about 500 miles and an\r\naverage width of approximately 40 miles, and is greater in area than\r\neither Belgium, Denmark, or Switzerland. It is divided in reference to\r\ndrainage into two portions, the San Joaquin Valley at the south and the\r\nSacramento Valley at the north, named respectively after the\r\nrivers that drain them. These two streams unite and discharge into San\r\nFrancisco Bay, the outlet of which is through the Golden Gate to the\r\nPacific. This central basin of California has a generally flat bottom\r\ncomposed of a great depth of unconsolidated gravel, sand, and clay,\r\nwhich are believed to owe their deposition mainly to the streams flowing\r\nfrom the bordering mountains, although in part they may have been\r\ndeposited when the land was more depressed than now and the basin was a\r\ngreat sound, connected with the ocean by a single narrow opening. The\r\nrock-waste swept into the valley served not only to add to the\r\naccumulations forming its floor, but to give the bottom some\r\nirregularities. A portion of its southern end, shut off by alluvial\r\ndeposits brought down from the Sierra Nevada, is occupied by the shallow\r\nalkaline waters of Tulare Lake. When the great valley was first visited\r\nby white men it was without trees, except along the immediate borders of\r\nsome of the streams, and for the most part was a luxuriant meadow of\r\nwild grasses and flowers. On the uplands oak-trees grew in scattered\r\npark-like groves with gorgeously flower-decked hills and vales between.\r\nThis favoured land, clothed in its natural beauties, came as near being\r\nan Eden as perhaps any portion of the continent. The changes that have\r\nfollowed the settlement and cultivation of this great mountain-inclosed\r\nbasin are simply marvellous. Cities and villages have been built,\r\norchards and vineyards planted which yield most bountiful harvests, and\r\nthe once grass-covered plains are now seemingly boundless wheat-fields.\r\nThe unkept natural garden of half a century ago has become a granary not\r\nonly for the people of America, but for those of Asia as well.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the Klamath Mountains, which shut in the central Valley\r\nof California at the north, lies the beautiful Willamette Valley, about\r\n150 miles long, drained by the northward-flowing river of the same name,\r\nwhich joins the Columbia where the thriving city of Portland now stands.\r\nThe depression between the mountains of which the Valley of the\r\nWillamette forms a part, extends north of the Columbia, and is there\r\ndrained by the southward-flowing Cowlitz River. The relation of\r\nthese two valleys is much the same, although on a smaller scale, as that\r\nexisting between the San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys, except that the\r\nColumbia, after passing through the Cascade Mountains, receives the\r\nWillamette and Cowlitz rivers as tributaries, one from each side of its\r\ncourse. This Willamette-Cowlitz depression is surrounded by densely\r\nforested hills and the snow-capped summits of ancient volcanoes. The\r\nsoil was originally highly fertile, and although now somewhat\r\nimpoverished, still furnishes a substantial basis for agriculture, and\r\nrenders the region one of the most productive as well as most beautiful\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nTo the geographer the Willamette-Cowlitz Valley seems scarcely distinct\r\nfrom the great depression farther north in the same valley-chain, which\r\nnow holds the waters of Puget Sound, except that there is a low\r\nwater-parting between. This divide, as previously suggested, is thought\r\nto be due largely to stream and glacial deposits, which have been laid\r\ndown in the previously nearly level-floored intermontane trough.\r\n\r\nThe Puget Sound basin has a length from south to north of about 150\r\nmiles, and extends from the Olympic Mountains on the west to the Cascade\r\nMountains on the east, a distance of some 60 miles. The sound terminates\r\nat the north at the Strait of Fuca (at Port Townsend, in Fig. 23), but\r\nthe depression in which it lies continues northward, with similar\r\ngeographical and geological characteristics. In a general way the same\r\ndepression may be said to extend northward to southeastern Alaska, but\r\nis there deeply water-filled, and its western border is discontinuous\r\nand broken into many islands.\r\n\r\nThere are several features in the Puget Sound basin which especially\r\nimpress the traveller: Next to the magnificence of the lofty volcanic\r\ncones that stand like Titan watch-towers along the western slope of the\r\nCascades and the dense forest of gigantic firs and cedars, the most\r\nconspicuous feature of the region is the extreme irregularity of the\r\nsound itself. Even such general maps of Puget Sound as are\r\nusually available indicate that it is exceptional and different from all\r\nother water bodies on the continent, not including the extension of the\r\nsame series of basins northward. Not only is Puget Sound extremely\r\nirregular, and inconsistent with any theory that would ascribe its\r\norigin to the subsistence and drowning of stream-eroded valleys, but its\r\nwaters are deep and the channels narrow. The uplands between the\r\nwaterways are low plateaus composed of clay, gravel, and glacial\r\nmoraines. The explanation of these unique conditions is that glacial ice\r\nformerly occupied the basin and deposited moraines and gravel-plains and\r\nclay-plains about its margins; when the branching and irregular sheet of\r\nstagnant ice melted its place was taken by the waters of the sea. This\r\nsimplified outline of the later history of Puget Sound has many\r\nmodifications, the most important being that there were at least two\r\nperiods of ice occupation, with an intervening stage of mild climate\r\nbetween, during which the previously formed glacial deposits were forest\r\ncovered and thick beds of peat formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Puget Sound.]\r\n\r\nThe ice which occupied Puget Sound was the extreme southern portion of a\r\ngreat but irregular Piedmont glacier which fringed the rough and ragged\r\ncoast of the continent all the way to southern Alaska. A remnant of this\r\nformer ice body still exists near Mount St. Elias, and constitutes the\r\nvery instructive Malaspina glacier.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE MOUNTAINS BORDERING THE PACIFIC\r\n\r\nIn a preceding chapter the rugged topography of the western margin of\r\nthe continent has been briefly described, and a general explanation\r\ngiven of the contrasts which it presents to the coastal plains and\r\nplateaus on the Atlantic border.\r\n\r\nThe long, narrow peninsula known as Lower California, as yet unstudied\r\nin the light of modern geography, is known to be mountainous throughout.\r\nAlthough nearly surrounded by the waters of the ocean, the climate of\r\nthe peninsula is hot and arid and its surface desert-like. The Gulf of\r\nCalifornia, which separates such a large portion of the Pacific border\r\nof Mexico from the main body of the republic, has the characteristics of\r\na drowned intermontane or orogenic valley. But whether the great\r\ndepression was ever dry land or not is unknown. The waters of the gulf\r\nare shallow, however, and a moderate upward movement of the earth's\r\ncrust in that region would transform it into a great valley similar in\r\nits general features to the central basin of the State of California.\r\n\r\nWhat are frequently designated collectively as the Coast Mountains begin\r\nat the south and adjacent to the shore of the Pacific, in the vicinity\r\nof Santa Barbara, Cal., and extend northward along the immediate\r\nseaboard far into British Columbia. A continuation or branch of this\r\nseries of elevations follows the south coast of Alaska, and is prolonged\r\nso as to form the Aleutian Islands. The length of the mountain system or\r\nsuccession of ranges referred to is between 3,500 and 4,000 miles. The\r\ndetailed study of this long, narrow, and in many parts excessively\r\nrugged region is as yet in its infancy, and only a brief account of its\r\nsalient features can be attempted at present.\r\n\r\nIn southern California the structure of the mountains and the deep\r\nstream-deposited gravel, etc., in the intervening valleys, as well as\r\nthe aridity of the climate and character of the vegetation, correspond\r\nclosely with the similar conditions in the Great Basin. In fact, the\r\nGreat Basin region, as the term has been used on a previous page, there\r\nmeets the Pacific, and the islands rising from the adjacent\r\nportion of the ocean seem to be the summits of mountains of the Basin\r\nRange type. Owing to the dryness of the climate in southern California\r\nand adjacent portions of Mexico, the deeply alluvial-filled valleys are\r\ntreeless, and agriculture is only possible with the aid of irrigation.\r\nWhere water can be had, however, there are wonderfully productive\r\norchards, vineyards, and gardens, in which the fruits and flowers of\r\nboth the temperate and torrid zones flourish side by side with\r\nmarvellous luxuriance. The palm there casts its shadow on fragrant\r\nbowers of the most superb roses. The grass-clothed mountain slopes are\r\neither bare of trees or but scantily forested, while the upland valleys\r\nproduce a dense jungle of native trees and shrubs.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the irregular and diversified portion of southern\r\nCalifornia, where the Great Basin region extends southwestward to the\r\nPacific, rises the southern Coast Range of California. The indefinite\r\nbeginning of this range is in the neighbourhood of Point Conception, to\r\nthe north of Santa Barbara, and its northern terminus is at the Golden\r\nGate. The same belt of mountains extends northward, however, and forms\r\nthe northern Coast Range, which extends to the Klamath Mountains in\r\nnorthern California. The coast ranges of California as a whole are about\r\n500 miles long and from 30 to 40 miles broad, and comprise several\r\nseemingly distinct uplifts, some of which have culminating peaks from\r\n4,000 to about 7,000 feet high. In general this elevated region is\r\nconspicuously sculptured, and in part at least has the characteristics\r\nof an eroded plateau. The suggestion has been offered that the northern\r\nportion of the Coast Range is a dissected peneplain.\r\n\r\nThe Coast Ranges, although generally bare of trees to the south of the\r\nGolden Gate, become more and more densely forested when followed\r\nnorthward. It is in this northern division that the great forests of\r\nredwood occur, now so largely used for lumber. Reference is here made\r\nnot to the \"big trees,\" which grow in certain restricted areas on the\r\nwest slope of the Sierra Nevada, but to the far more extensive forests\r\nof a related species.\r\n\r\nConsidering mountain forms simply, it is difficult if not impossible to\r\ndetermine where the Coast Mountains of California terminate at the\r\nnorth, but, as has been shown especially by J. S. Diller, there are\r\nreasons based on geological structure for separating them from the\r\nirregular group of ranges and peaks in northern California and southern\r\nOregon recently named the Klamath Mountains. The coast system is\r\ncontinued north of the Klamath Mountains by the Coast Mountains of\r\nOregon, which extend to the Columbia River, and consist of irregular\r\nridges or series of ridges, with bold lateral spurs, especially on the\r\nocean side. It varies conspicuously in height from place to place, yet\r\nnowhere attains a great altitude. The elevations of the bolder summits,\r\nalthough not accurately measured, seldom exceed 3,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe Coast Mountains of Oregon are considered as terminating at the\r\nnorthern boundary of the State, there defined by the Columbia River, but\r\nno reason is apparent, however, for not including in the same group the\r\nelevated land lying in southwestern Washington and adjacent to the\r\nPacific coast. Between the Columbia and Chehalis River in Washington\r\nthere is a rugged region which attains an elevation of over 4,000 feet,\r\nand is separated from the Olympic Mountains to the northward by Chehalis\r\nValley. Although the geology of this group of ridges and peaks is\r\nentirely unknown, its position and general appearance, when seen from a\r\ndistance, suggest that it might properly be considered as a direct\r\nextension of the Coast Mountains of Oregon.\r\n\r\nFollowing the general belt of the Coast Ranges still farther northward,\r\nwe come to the splendid group of forest-clothed mountains, with usually\r\nsnow-covered summits, situated to the west of Puget Sound, and known as\r\nthe Olympic Mountains. This magnificent range is in full view from\r\nVictoria, Seattle, and Tacoma, and would be far-famed for its grandeur\r\nwere it not for its near rival, the still more lofty Cascade Range.\r\n\r\nThere are several fine, sharp peaks in the Olympics that have never been\r\nscaled, the highest of which, Mount Olympus, rises 8,150 feet\r\nabove the sea. Owing to the excessive humidity and other favourable\r\nclimatic conditions, these mountains are clothed with magnificent\r\nforests up to an elevation of about 7,000 feet. On account of the\r\nruggedness of the country, the extreme density of the tangled\r\nundergrowth, and the obstructions formed by the fallen moss- and\r\nlichen-covered trees, this region is extremely difficult to traverse,\r\nand to-day is the least known of the continental portion of the United\r\nStates. On the north the excessively rugged Olympic peninsula is\r\nbordered by a deep, broad fiord known as the Strait of Fuca. To the\r\nnorth of this formerly ice-filled channel lies Vancouver Island, the\r\ncentral and northern portion of which is mountainous. The highest summit\r\non the island rises about 7,500 feet above the sea, and a considerable\r\narea in its central part has an elevation of over 2,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe Olympics, together with the mountains of Vancouver and Queen\r\nCharlotte Islands, and the northern extension of the same belt, embraced\r\nin part within the mainland of British Columbia and southeastern Alaska,\r\nhave been termed the \"Vancouver Mountains\" by Canadian geographers. The\r\nnorthern boundary of this mountain system, justly named in honour of the\r\ncelebrated English explorer who mapped large portions of the northwest\r\ncoast about a century since, remains indefinite, and cannot be\r\ndetermined until geologists have made more thorough explorations of the\r\nland it occupies. The leading geographical features of this region, as\r\nremarked in a preceding chapter, are due to the deep dissection, by\r\nstreams and glaciers, of an elevated table-land. When the ice-streams\r\nmelted, the sea was permitted to enter the valleys, so as to form\r\nnumerous deep, narrow, steep-walled fiords (Fig. 11). The coast is, in\r\nfact, the most ragged of any portion of the border of the continent. All\r\nbut the higher summits are clothed with a dense mantle of vegetation,\r\nthe upper limit of which decreases in elevation when followed northward,\r\nfrom about 7,000 feet in the Olympics to approximately 2,500 feet in\r\nsouthern Alaska. Perennial snow exists in the higher valleys and\r\namphitheatres of the Olympics, but the presence of true glaciers\r\nin that group of peaks has not been demonstrated. When followed\r\nnorthward the snow-line becomes lower and lower, and well-defined alpine\r\nglaciers are known to exist in many of the valleys, more especially on\r\nthe mainland of British Columbia and southeastern Alaska. There streams\r\nof ice descend lower and lower with increase in latitude, and to the\r\nnorth of Stickeen River, in a number of instances, enter the fiords\r\nwhich connect with the ocean and become tide-water glaciers.\r\n\r\nTo the west of Lynn Canal, and extending to beyond Copper River, is the\r\nmost rugged portion of North America, and contains also some of the\r\nhighest mountain-peaks on the continent thus far measured.\r\n\r\nThe region of high mountains in Alaska and the adjacent portion of\r\nCanada begins on the east in the group of magnificent peaks which\r\ncluster about Mount Fairweather as a centre and extend westward, with a\r\nbreadth of some 80 miles, to beyond Mount St. Elias. Farther westward,\r\nbeyond Copper River, other great mountains are known to exist. One of\r\nthese, Mount McKinley, has an elevation of 20,400 feet, and so far as\r\nnow known is the highest peak in North America.\r\n\r\nThe highest summit to the east of Copper River is Mount Logan, 19,500\r\nfeet. This superb ice-sheathed peak is situated in Canada about 40 miles\r\nfrom the coast and 12 miles east of the one hundred and forty-first\r\nmeridian. Second in rank is Mount St. Elias, 18,070 feet, situated close\r\nto the one hundred and forty-first meridian, and within the territory\r\nbelonging to the United States. These two summits are the highest in a\r\nland of lofty snow-covered mountains, and for this reason have claimed a\r\nlarge share of attention. There are many neighbouring peaks, however,\r\nthat are wonderfully magnificent, but only a few of them have been\r\nmeasured and many of them are still unnamed. Only one of the high\r\nmountains of Alaska, namely, Mount St. Elias, has been climbed. This\r\nsplendid feat of mountaineering was accomplished by Prince Luigi, of\r\nSavoy, in 1899.\r\n\r\nIn southern Alaska the snow-line is only about 2,500 feet above\r\ntide, and a large number of magnificent glaciers descend to sea-level,\r\nand many of them actually enter the ocean. All of the valleys and basins\r\namong the higher summits are occupied by snow-fields and glaciers. The\r\ngeneral covering of ice and snow as well as the ruggedness of the land\r\nmakes this the most difficult of all the mountainous portions of North\r\nAmerica to traverse.\r\n\r\nIn the St. Elias region the mountains have been produced by upheaval,\r\nand are not volcanic in their origin. The frequently repeated statement\r\nthat Mount St. Elias is a volcano is incorrect. Although igneous rocks\r\noccur near its summit, they are of the nature of dikes or intrusions,\r\nprobably of ancient date, and not lava-flows. The principal volcanic\r\nmountains of Alaska are farther west in the region of the Alaskan\r\npeninsula and the Aleutian Islands. This western extension of the\r\ncontinent is excessively rugged, but the mountains rise directly from\r\nthe ocean and in part form a chain of precipitous islands with irregular\r\ntopographic forms.\r\n\r\nThere are mountain ranges also in the central and northern portions of\r\nAlaska and the adjacent part of Canada, but this region awaits\r\nexploration, and but little accurate information concerning its\r\ntopography is on record.\r\n\r\n_The Mountains of Western Canada._--Reference has already been made to\r\nthe differences in the nomenclature applied to the portions of the\r\nPacific mountains on opposite sides of the United States-Canadian\r\nboundary, and at present this lack of harmony cannot be adjusted. As is\r\nwell known, the great Pacific cordillera crosses the boundary nearly at\r\nright angles, and there is no abrupt change in the topography of the\r\nland. From the western border of the Great plateaus to the Pacific,\r\nbetween the forty-fifth and fifty-sixth parallels, as stated by the\r\nGeological Survey of Canada, the cordillera has an average breadth of\r\nabout 400 miles, and is composed of four great mountain chains, named in\r\ntheir order from east to west, the Rocky, Gold, Coast, and Vancouver\r\nMountains. These four great chains are nearly parallel and have\r\nirregular northwest and southeast trends.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Rockies rise abruptly from Great plateaus in which the\r\nrocks are nearly horizontal, and have a complex structure, due to the\r\nfolding and other disturbances that have affected the strata. Deep\r\ndissection by stream erosion has occurred, as is the case generally\r\nthroughout the Pacific cordillera, and the peaks and ridges remaining\r\nare remarkable for their grandeur. Although less elevated than the\r\nhigher portions of the same great belt in the United States, many of the\r\nsummits are from 8,000 to 10,000, and, as reported, in a few instances\r\nreach 13,000 feet in height, while the passes range is elevated from\r\nabout 4,000 to 7,000 feet. The western border of the Rocky Mountain\r\nrange is well defined for a distance of some 700 miles to the northward\r\nof the international boundary by a remarkably straight, wide valley,\r\nwhich is occupied by the head waters of several large rivers, namely,\r\nthe Kootenay, Columbia, Fraser, Parsnip, and Findley. To the west of the\r\ngreat valley just referred to rises the Gold system, composed\r\nprincipally of the Selkirk, Purcell, Columbia, and Caribou Ranges. It is\r\nin this rugged region that some of the most remarkable of the splendid\r\nscenery of western Canada occurs.\r\n\r\nTo the west of the Gold system is a broad region of valleys and lesser\r\nmountains, known as the interior plateau of British Columbia, which is a\r\nnorthward extension of the Great Basin region of the United States. The\r\nbreadth of this belt of comparatively low country is about 100 miles.\r\nLike the similar region in Washington and Oregon, it is without forests,\r\nbut favourable as a grazing country. In part it is occupied by extensive\r\nlava-flows, similar to the Columbia River lava of the northwestern part\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Coast Mountains of Canada, although stated by geologists to be\r\ndistinct from the Cascade Mountains, are in part at least, as determined\r\nby the present writer, a direct northward extension of that range. The\r\naverage elevation of the higher peaks in the Canadian Coast Range, as it\r\nis termed, is between 6,000 and 7,000 feet, while the culminating points\r\nreach an elevation of about 9,000 feet. How far northward the\r\nnomenclature applied to the Pacific mountains in southwestern Canada\r\nwill be found applicable can not be stated, as the region to the north\r\nof the fifty-sixth parallel is almost wholly unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE ANTILLEAN MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nAs has been clearly pointed out by R. T. Hill, the Pacific cordillera\r\nends at the south in south-central Mexico, while the Andean cordillera\r\nat its northern end terminates in the rugged mountains of Venezuela to\r\nthe south of the Caribbean Sea. These two great cordilleras do not\r\noverlap, but there is a difference of about 10 degrees of latitude\r\nbetween them, and if extended they would pass each other at a distance\r\nof nearly 1,000 miles. In the space thus indicated, measuring some\r\n600,000 square miles, is included the southern portion of Mexico,\r\nCentral America, and the West Indies. The rocks in these countries\r\npresent a great series of folds which trend in an easterly and westerly\r\ndirection, and thus present a conspicuous exception to the major\r\nstructural features of both North and South America. To this newly\r\nrecognised division of the larger geological and geographical\r\ncharacteristics of the New World the name _Antillean mountains_ has been\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThe folds or corrugations in the rocks of the Central American and\r\nCaribbean region extend in an east and west direction along the seaward\r\nmargin of Venezuela and Colombia from the Orinoco westward to the\r\nIsthmus of Panama, and thence continue westward through Costa Rica, the\r\neastern portions of Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Honduras, and reach\r\nsouthern Oaxaca in Mexico. The same system of plications is revealed\r\nalso on the larger West India islands. The rocks of this great region\r\ninclude granite and allied metamorphosed terranes, old lavas, and\r\nsedimentary beds.\r\n\r\nOne of the most conspicuous features of this region with a structure and\r\nrelief commonly found in mountains is that to a great extent it is\r\ndepressed beneath the sea, and only the higher summits are in view. Some\r\nof the larger inequalities of the rock surface have been\r\ndiscovered by means of the sounding-line. By referring to Fig. 3, it\r\nwill be seen that two submarine ridges extend in an east and west\r\ndirection beneath the Caribbean Sea, from the West Indies to the Central\r\nAmerican coast, and are separated by Bartlett Deep. These ridges\r\ncorrespond in trend with the longer axes of the folds in the Antillean\r\nmountains, and suggest a common origin for the leading geographical\r\nfeatures of the land and of the still more remarkable topography of the\r\nsea-floor.\r\n\r\nIn addition to mountains produced by corrugation and upheaval, there are\r\nalso in the middle American region numerous volcanic mountains. Of these\r\nthere are two well-defined belts, each trending in general north and\r\nsouth, or directly across the longer axes of the folds of the Antillean\r\nmountains. One of these belts of volcanic cones and craters is situated\r\non the Pacific coast of Central America and Mexico, and includes some 25\r\nactive volcanoes, and the other is defined by the numerous volcanic\r\nislands of the Lesser Antilles. The association of these belts of\r\nfracture through which molten rock has been extruded and where\r\nearthquakes are of common occurrence, with the junction of the east and\r\nwest belt of plication to which the Antillean mountains are due, with\r\nthe north and south belts of mountains forming the Pacific and Andean\r\ncordilleras, is significant in connection with the study of the origin\r\nof the larger features of the relief of the solid earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVaried as is the relief of North America when studied in detail, an\r\noutline sketch of its major features may be readily retained in mind. On\r\nthe east side of the main continental area are the Atlantic mountains,\r\nextending from near the Gulf coast northward to beyond Hudson Strait; in\r\nthe central part is the broad continental basin, a vast region of low\r\nrelief reaching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean; west of the\r\ncontinental basin are the Pacific mountains, the greatest of all the\r\nelevations on the continent, which begin abruptly in south-central\r\nMexico and extend northward, expanding to a width of about 1,000\r\nmiles in the United States and reach the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea.\r\nThe movements in the earth's crust, which blocked out these major\r\nphysiographic features, were produced by forces acting in east and west\r\ndirections, and gave origin to folds and faults with their longer axes\r\ntrending north and south. To the south of the main body of the\r\ncontinent, in middle America, are situated the Antillean mountains, also\r\na cordillera comparable with the Atlantic and Pacific cordilleras, in\r\nwhich the longer axes of the folds and faults trend east and west, and\r\nare due to forces acting in north and south directions. The Antillean\r\nmountains in a general way connect or intervene between the Pacific and\r\nthe Andean cordilleras. Where the Antillean mountains cross the axes of\r\nthe Pacific and Andean cordilleras are situated the volcanoes of\r\nsouthern Mexico and Central America, and those of the Lesser Antilles.\r\n\r\nGeographers will recognise that this outline is drawn boldly, but\r\nalthough it will no doubt have to be modified as detailed studies\r\nprogress, it should serve to emphasize the leading geographic divisions\r\nof the North American continent when viewed as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LITERATURE\r\n\r\nThe following list of publications relating to the physiography of North\r\nAmerica is here presented largely because the books mentioned contain\r\nbibliographies or references which indicate sources of more special\r\ninformation:\r\n\r\n  _American Geographical Society, Bulletin._ Published annually.\r\n\r\n  _Canadian Geological Survey_, Ottawa, Canada.

On the accompanying map,\r\nPlate II, the mean annual temperature of the continent is represented by\r\n_isotherms_, or lines drawn through localities having the same average\r\ntemperature for the year. On the same map is also shown in blue the\r\naverage depth of precipitation, including both rains and melted snow. On\r\nFig. 24 lines are drawn through points having the same average\r\nbarometrical pressure (_isobars_) for the months of January and July,\r\ntogether with arrows indicating the general direction of the surface\r\nwinds during each of these months, which may be considered as\r\nrepresentative of the summer and winter seasons. The data shown on these\r\nmaps have been compiled mainly from the reports of the weather bureaus\r\nof Canada, the United States, and Mexico, and indicate, at least in a\r\ngeneral way, a summary of what is known concerning the main\r\nmeteorological elements which determine the climatic conditions in North\r\nAmerica. An examination of these maps will suggest certain general\r\nconclusions in reference to the leading characteristics of the climate\r\nin various portions of the continent and the changes they undergo\r\nfrom season to season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Average barometric pressure and direction of\r\nwind for January and July.]\r\n\r\n_Distribution of Heat and Light._--The distribution over the earth's\r\nsurface of the heat and light received from the sun is not only of\r\nfundamental importance as respects climate, but furnishes a part of the\r\nessential conditions on which depend the presence and distribution of\r\nliving organisms. The heat and light, or more accurately, the radiant\r\nenergy of the sun, the full significance of which is probably not\r\nthoroughly understood, we term, for convenience, _insolation_. The\r\nintensity and seasonal distribution of insolation are prime factors on\r\nwhich many important results hinge.\r\n\r\nOwing to the inclination of the axis about which the earth rotates (23 deg.\r\n27') to the plane in which the earth travels about the sun, or the plane\r\nof the ecliptic, the northern end of the axis is turned towards the sun\r\nin summer and away from it in winter--that is, the axis of rotation of\r\nthe earth at all times is parallel to the same imaginary straight line.\r\nAs a result, the sun appears to migrate northward in the heavens during\r\nthe spring-time of each year, being vertical over the equator on March\r\n21st, and to an observer in north latitude 23 deg. 27' rises higher and\r\nhigher each moon, until on June 21st it is vertically overhead; and then\r\nreturns southward. The latitude in which the sun is in the zenith at the\r\ntime of its greatest northward migration determines the position of an\r\nimaginary line on the earth's surface, named the Tropic of Cancer. This\r\nline, as shown on the accompanying maps, crosses the Bahama Islands,\r\npasses about 40 miles to the northward of Havana, divides Mexico into\r\ntwo approximately equal parts, and cuts the peninsula of Lower\r\nCalifornia near its southern end. The portion of the continent to the\r\nsouth of the Tropic of Cancer lies within the torrid zone.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun is vertical over the equator, as it is about March 21st and\r\nSeptember 23d each year, its rays, not allowing for refraction, are\r\ntangent to the earth's surface at the poles, and the hours of light and\r\ndarkness are equal the world over. During the winter season the sun\r\nappears to migrate southward of the equator until December 21st,\r\nwhen it is vertical at noon at all points situated in south latitude 23 deg.\r\n27', which is termed the Tropic of Capricorn. Its rays are then tangent\r\nto the earth's surface in the northern hemisphere in latitude 66 deg. 33',\r\nwhich defines the position of the arctic circle. This imaginary line on\r\nthe earth's surface, as is indicated on the accompanying maps, crosses\r\nCanada to the north of Hudson Bay, and passes through Alaska near where\r\nthe Porcupine River joins the Yukon. To the north of the arctic circle\r\nlies the frigid zone. Between the torrid and frigid zones is situated\r\nthe temperate zone, within which is included about seven-eighths of\r\nNorth America, exclusive of Greenland. The relation of the continent to\r\nthe three great zones of climate into which the northern hemisphere is\r\ndivided is thus most fortunate so far as man's activities are concerned.\r\n\r\nThe climatic zones just referred to, while based on precise astronomical\r\ndata and representing important facts, are not separated one from\r\nanother by tangible lines, and might easily pass undiscovered by one who\r\nstudied only the surface characteristics of the earth. Each summer a\r\nwave of heat and light sweeps northward over the continent and reaches\r\nbeyond the pole; and each winter a counteracting wave of cold and\r\ndarkness moves southward, the influence of which is marked even well\r\nwithin the torrid zone. A comparison of the isothermal lines drawn on\r\nthe map forming Plate II with the parallels of latitude\r\nshows at a glance that there is only a general relationship between the\r\ntwo. In order to understand this discrepancy between what might be\r\nexpected from astronomical considerations in reference to the\r\ndistribution of solar energy and the actual conditions as learned by\r\nobservation, it is necessary to take a more critical view of the manner\r\nin which insolation is received by the continent, and also to consider\r\nsecondary conditions which exert far-reaching influences on its\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nThe amount of heat, or to avoid objections, the distribution of\r\ninsolation over North America, depends on three primary conditions:\r\nFirst, the angle at which the sun's rays strike the earth, the range\r\nbeing from zero to 90 deg.; second, the length of time a particular\r\nlocality is exposed to sunlight; and third, variations in the distance\r\nof the earth from the sun. Each of these conditions varies from day to\r\nday for every locality throughout the continent. The sun is highest in\r\nthe heavens in the torrid zone, being twice vertically overhead each\r\nyear at every locality, and the hours of light and darkness each day are\r\napproximately equal throughout the year. North of the torrid zone,\r\nhowever, the rays of the sun become more and more oblique to the earth's\r\nsurface, and hence insolation becomes weaker and weaker for a given\r\nperiod of sunshine as one travels from south to north. But the hours of\r\nsunlight each day undergo marked variations, lengthening from December\r\n21st to June 21st, and shortening as the sun makes its southward\r\nmigration. At the north pole, as all know, there are six months of light\r\nand six months of darkness each year. The amount of insolation reaching\r\nthe northern portion of the continent each day increases with the\r\nlengthening of the hours of light, and during midsummer is greater for a\r\ngiven area in a single day (twenty-four hours) than the amount received\r\nby a similar area in the torrid zone. The almost magical springing into\r\nlife and bloom of the vegetation over the northern portion of the\r\ncontinent with the lengthening of the hours of sunshine each summer is\r\nthus explained. In the portion of the continent within the temperate\r\nzone, more especially within the continental basin, the large number of\r\nhours of sunshine during a summer's day is frequently accompanied by a\r\ntemperature as great as is usually experienced in the torrid zone. It is\r\nthe high summer temperature of this region, together with the lengthened\r\nduration of sunshine in the growing season, that makes the Mississippi\r\nbasin and the adjacent region on the east and north so favourable for\r\nagriculture when the requisite amount of moisture is present.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of heat over the earth's surface depends not only on\r\nthe direct influence of insolation, but on its transfer from one\r\nlocality to another through the agency of the winds and ocean currents.\r\nThe movements of the waters of the ocean, it will be remembered, are\r\nlargely under the control of the winds, so that the essential\r\nfactor in the transfer of heat from place to place is atmospheric\r\ncirculation. The primary causes of movements in the air, as is a matter\r\nof current knowledge, are the differences that arise in temperature at\r\nvarious localities. In regions where the air becomes more highly heated\r\nthan over adjacent areas it expands, and in consequence becomes lighter,\r\nvolume for volume, than the air over neighbouring areas, and is forced\r\nupward and overflows aloft. The overflow or dispersion of the warmer and\r\nlighter air above gives origin to a reduction in barometric pressure,\r\nthe column of mercury in a barometer being counterbalanced by the\r\npressure of the air above it. Briefly stated, the air near the earth's\r\nsurface flows towards regions of low, and away from regions of high\r\nbarometric pressure, and winds are established. The directions taken by\r\nthe winds are influenced or controlled in various ways.\r\n\r\n_The Planetary Winds._--The great movements in the atmosphere originate\r\nfrom differences in temperature between the warm equatorial and cold\r\npolar regions. This alone would cause the cold air from either pole to\r\nflow towards the equator as surface winds, and the warm air in the\r\nequatorial belt to ascend and overflow aloft towards either pole. The\r\nearth's rotation, however, influences the direction of these winds and\r\ncauses them to be deflected from the lines of longitude which they would\r\notherwise follow. In the northern hemisphere the air-currents are\r\ndeflected to the right and in the southern hemisphere to the left of\r\ntheir initial directions. The best known examples of these planetary\r\nwinds, as they are termed, are the trade-winds, which blow from the\r\nnortheast in the northern and from the southeast in the southern\r\nhemisphere. Between these two belts of converging winds lies the\r\nequatorial belt of calm, some 300 miles wide, which also encircles the\r\nearth and is termed the doldrums.\r\n\r\nIn the quadrant of the earth's surface occupied by North America the\r\nclimatic conditions are controlled in a large measure by the planetary\r\nwinds. In the equatorial belt of calms the barometric pressure is lower\r\nthan on either side, the temperature is uniformly high, the air\r\nis heavily charged with moisture, and torrential rains are frequent. In\r\nthe belt of the northeast trades the weight of the air for a given area\r\nis greater than in the doldrums, the wind blows with remarkable\r\nuniformity both of direction and force, the sky is normally clear, and\r\nrain infrequent except when the warm moist air is forced upward either\r\nby local storms or on coming in contact with high land. The trade-winds\r\nblow across the West Indies, Mexico, and much of Central America. To the\r\nnorth of the trade-wind belt is a belt of prevailingly high barometrical\r\npressure, light variable winds, narrower and less well defined than the\r\ndoldrums, which encircles the earth in the region of the Tropic of\r\nCancer. This belt of calms, although familiar to sailors, to whom it is\r\nknown as the \"horse latitudes,\" is ill-defined on the land, where its\r\npresence is masked by changes due to local conditions. To the north of\r\nthe tropical calm belt the prevailing surface winds are from the\r\nwestward, and owe their direction to the constant flow of the upper\r\nair-currents in their poleward journey, under the influence of the\r\nearth's rotation. This great belt of winds from the westward crosses the\r\nportion of North America including the United States and southern\r\nCanada, but it is subject to many disturbances. The northern portion of\r\nthe continent extends into the little known polar region of prevailingly\r\nlow barometrical pressure, where midsummer and midwinter calms normally\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nThe great world-encircling currents of the atmosphere, namely, the\r\ntrade-winds, blowing towards the southwest or west across the Caribbean\r\nand Mexican region, and the prevailing westerlies, or winds blowing in\r\nan easterly direction, over the broad temperate portion of North\r\nAmerica, exert the main control on the climate of the continent.\r\n\r\n_The Seasons._--Of primary importance to the inhabitants of North\r\nAmerica is the fact that the climatic belts determined by the\r\ninclination of the earth's axis to the plane of the ecliptic are subject\r\nto annual migration towards the north and south. In the torrid zone the\r\nequatorial belt of calms, with its humid and oppressively hot\r\natmosphere, prevailing cloudiness, and heavy rains, and the belt\r\nof the northeast trades, with its prevailingly clear skies and\r\nrefreshing breezes, do not occupy the same positions throughout the\r\nyear, but migrate with the sun. The migration of these two strongly\r\ncontrasted climatic belts brings to the otherwise remarkably uniform\r\nconditions of the atmosphere over the West Indies, Central America, and\r\nMexico, two, in general well-defined, periods each year, namely, a wet\r\nand a dry season, the former occurring in the summer and the latter in\r\nthe winter. It is to be borne in mind that between the tropics there\r\nare, with certain local exceptions, but two seasons each year, the\r\nleading contrasts of which are determined by differences in rainfall.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the Tropic of Cancer the seasonal changes are more\r\nvaried than in the torrid zone, and contrasts in temperature become the\r\nmost marked climatic feature; while precipitation, although in general\r\nsomewhat evenly distributed throughout the year, is more abundant in\r\nwinter than in summer. On account, however, of the greater diversity in\r\nthe climatic changes experienced each year within the temperate zone,\r\nfour seasons are recognised, the most distinctive features of which\r\ndepend on changes in both temperature and humidity.\r\n\r\nIn the northern portion of the temperate zone, and extending over the\r\narctic zone, the seasons are again reduced to two, summer and winter,\r\nthe contrasted conditions pertaining mainly to temperature and light.\r\n\r\nA marked variation, which has an important bearing not only on climate,\r\nbut on the distribution of life encountered in passing from equatorial\r\nto polar regions, is found in the distribution of light. Between the\r\ntropics the number of hours of light and darkness each day is\r\napproximately equal; in the temperate zone there is considerable\r\ndiversity from season to season, which increases with increase in\r\nlatitude; and uniformity, of a different character than at the far\r\nsouth, again becomes prominent in the frigid zone, where the number of\r\nhours of light each day is greatly prolonged during the summer and\r\ncorrespondingly decreased during the winter. The extreme contrast\r\noccurs in the neighbourhood of the pole, where during the summer season\r\nthe sun is continuously above, and in winter continuously below the\r\nhorizon, or in familiar language, there is a six-months day (light) and\r\na six-months night (darkness).\r\n\r\nIn going from the equatorial to north polar regions there is a general\r\ndecrease in mean annual temperature, and in general a decrease also in\r\nprecipitation, but great variations in these gradual changes, with\r\nincrease in latitude, occur which are both continental and local in\r\ncharacter. In winter the interior portions of the continent, and\r\nespecially the plateaus and mountains, are colder than the lands in\r\ncorresponding latitudes near the oceans; while in summer the reverse is\r\ntrue, the margin of the continent being cooler than the broad interior.\r\n\r\nIn this general view of the climatic zones and the normal changes they\r\nundergo we may note that the torrid zone is characterized by its\r\nsimplicity and monotony of climatic conditions, although disturbed at\r\ntimes, especially in the West Indies, by occasional great cyclonic\r\nstorms, termed hurricanes, which occur, however, at quite definite\r\nseasons. The temperate belt is equally well marked by its complex and\r\nfrequently changing atmospheric conditions, the winds being subject to\r\nnumerous and great variations, and storms of diverse character being\r\nfrequent. The frigid zone, again, is without conspicuous variations\r\nexcept during the change from its monotonous summer to its still more\r\nuniform winter weather, and the reverse change six months later. The\r\ndisturbances in the balance of atmospheric conditions at the far north,\r\nor the storms, are of a much less varied character than in the fickle\r\ntemperate zone--thunder-storms and tornadoes, for example, being\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nIt is the summer migration of a heated belt from the south northward\r\nacross the temperate zone, and the equally conspicuous winter advances\r\nof cold from the north southward across the same broad region, which\r\ngives to the United States and the southern portion of Canada a\r\nconspicuously changeable climate. The temperate zone, so far at\r\nleast as North America is concerned, deserves its name only when the\r\nmean of the yearly changes in temperature is considered, as much of it\r\nis hotter in summer than equal areas between the tropics, and in winter\r\nover all of its northern half the cold is, at times, nearly or quite as\r\nintense as during the same season in the far north. As a whole, the\r\nportion of the continent embraced in the temperate zone is characterized\r\nby its pronounced seasonal changes, including wide extremes of heat and\r\ncold over large areas, and by its frequently sudden and strongly marked\r\nweather changes during short periods of time. It is a highly suggestive\r\nfact that of all the great climatic zones the one having the most\r\nchangeable climate, the greatest extremes of heat and cold, and the most\r\nfrequent storms should be the one in which man has reached the highest\r\ndevelopment both of body and mind. Evidently it is the _struggle_ for\r\nexistence, when not too severe, which insures advancement. The part of\r\nNorth America most densely inhabited by descendants of Europeans, and\r\nthe portion of the continent where intellectual development has made the\r\ngreatest advance, is the east-central portion, where not only the\r\nvariation of climate from season to season, but the weather changes from\r\nweek to week and day to day are the most conspicuous.\r\n\r\n_Secondary Conditions influencing Climate._--While the primary\r\nconditions controlling the climate of North America in common with all\r\nother portions of the earth's surface depend on the relation of the\r\nearth to the sun, there are many secondary conditions to be considered.\r\nFirst in importance among these, so far as the broader features of the\r\nclimate of the continent are concerned, is the unequal heating of land\r\nand water areas. During summer, more especially in the temperate zone,\r\nthe land becomes more highly heated than the adjacent oceans, and an\r\ninflow of the cooler and moister air from the sea over the land occurs.\r\nIn winter the land cools more quickly and to a greater degree than the\r\nadjacent waters, and the tendency of the heavier air over the land is to\r\nflow outward as surface winds. Continental winds are thus generated,\r\nsimilar in their origin to the familiar land and sea breezes of the\r\nocean shore in summer, but on a large scale, which have an\r\nimportant bearing on the seasonal changes. The influence of the\r\ncontinental winds is sufficiently well marked to give North America two\r\ngeneral classes of climate. One pertains to inland regions, is\r\ncharacterized by great contrasts in temperature and humidity between\r\nsummer and winter, and is termed continental. The other pertains to the\r\nborder of the land where, on account of the equalizing influence of\r\nlarge water borders, the contrast between the climate of summer and\r\nwinter is less pronounced, and has received the general title of oceanic\r\nclimate. The climate of the Dakotas, for example, is of the continental\r\ntype, while that of New Jersey is of the oceanic type.\r\n\r\nThe unequal heating and cooling of adjacent portions of land areas also\r\nproduces important atmospheric movements, as, for instance, when broad,\r\ntreeless plains become more highly heated in summer than adjacent\r\nforested areas; or on account of rapid radiation become excessively cold\r\nin winter and lower the temperature of the air above them. In the first\r\ninstance an inflow of cooler and heavier air from adjacent regions would\r\nbe established; and in the second example the chilled air would tend to\r\nflow outward, thus, in each instance, establishing winds which usually\r\nacquire a more or less well-pronounced circular motion. The Prairie\r\nplains and the Great plateaus to the east of the Rocky Mountains become\r\nhighly heated in summer, and together with several other similar regions\r\nin North America, meet the first of the conditions just considered;\r\nwhile the higher portions of the Great plateau, especially at the north,\r\nand the still more elevated mountains of Montana, Colorado, etc., become\r\nexcessively cold in winter and illustrate the other extreme.\r\n\r\nMountains serve to deflect the winds blowing against them either to one\r\nside or upward, the former frequently producing important changes in\r\ndirection of the surface air-currents, and the latter, by causing the\r\nair to rise, permits of its expansion and consequent cooling, thus\r\nfavouring precipitation. For this and other reasons precipitation\r\nincreases with elevation, at least until an altitude of many\r\nthousands of feet is reached, and the mountains are cooler and more\r\nhumid than the adjacent valleys. The air-currents on passing over a\r\nmountain range and descending are warmed by compression, and having lost\r\na part and in many observed instances a large percentage of the moisture\r\nthey previously contained, become warm, drying winds. The chinook winds,\r\nas they are termed in America, are marked examples of the influence\r\nexerted by mountains on climatic conditions.\r\n\r\nWhat are termed above the secondary conditions, tending to modify\r\nclimate, produce such great changes in the distribution of rainfall,\r\ntemperature, etc., and in the influence of the planetary winds, that the\r\nsubdivision of the northern hemisphere into torrid, temperate, and\r\nfrigid zones, while based on astronomical data, does not serve to\r\nrepresent actual conditions, except in a general way, in reference even\r\nto the single element of temperature expressed in these names. A\r\ncomparison of the isotherms and of the distribution of precipitation as\r\nindicated on the preceding maps, with the parallels of latitude, shows\r\nat once that these two most important elements of climate are\r\nconspicuously independent of distance from the equator. A logical basis\r\nfor subdividing the continent into _climatic provinces_ must therefore\r\nbe sought in other directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CLIMATIC PROVINCES\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain a comprehensive idea of the climate of a continent,\r\nit is obviously desirable to subdivide it into areas having more or less\r\nsimilar and distinct atmospheric conditions. The leading difficulty in\r\nmaking such subdivisions is the well-known fact that the climate of any\r\nregion which may be chosen passes by insensible gradations into that of\r\nadjacent regions, and any boundaries that may be drawn are to a\r\nconsiderable extent artificial and arbitrary. While the true basis on\r\nwhich to establish climatic areas or provinces is the resultant of all\r\nthe weather elements which go to make up the atmospheric conditions\r\nrecognised under the broader term climate, so many factors have to be\r\nconsidered that it is extremely difficult to arrive at a general\r\nacceptable conclusion. The principal elements of the weather to be\r\nconsidered are, approximately, in the order of their importance,\r\nbeginning with the one which exerts almost universal control--temperature,\r\nprecipitation, the winds, absolute and relative humidity of the air, and\r\nevaporation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.--Climate & Life Provinces.]\r\n\r\nIn North America there are voluminous records in reference to each of\r\nthese elements of the weather, embracing considerable lengths of time,\r\nand relating mainly to the United States and southeastern Canada, but\r\nnot sufficient to enable one to subdivide the entire continent into\r\nclimatic provinces. The lack of weather records embracing the entire\r\ncontinent may be supplied in part by what may be termed the natural\r\nrecords of atmospheric conditions as expressed by the flora and fauna,\r\nas well as by soil conditions and topography. In recognition of this\r\nprinciple, the climatic provinces of North America here adopted have\r\nbeen made to conform to its life-zones.\r\n\r\nThe major climatic divisions of North America here provisionally adopted\r\nare, in their general order from south to north, the _Tropical_, _Lower\r\nAustral_, _Upper Austral_, _Transition_, _Boreal_, and _Arctic_ (Plate\r\nIII). These several divisions are termed climatic provinces, and are\r\nassumed to coincide with those of the life-regions as mapped by C. Hart\r\nMerriam. The basis for classification is mainly temperature. In the\r\nmain, the northern boundaries of the provinces and their higher limits\r\nin mountainous regions are determined by the temperature of the season\r\nof growth and reproduction among plants and animals; while their\r\nsouthern boundaries or lower limits on the mountains are determined by\r\nthe temperature of a brief period during the hottest portion of the\r\nyear. A more definite account of the reasons for choosing these\r\nlimitations will be given later in discussing life areas. While the\r\nprincipal basis for establishing climatic provinces is temperature, many\r\nother conditions are also recognised, chief among which is\r\nprecipitation. Several of the climatic provinces have two divisions,\r\nnamely, a _humid_ and an _arid_, the dividing line being\r\napproximately the one hundredth meridian. These are well defined and\r\nimportant in the tropical, austral, and transitional, but less definite\r\nand less well known in the boreal and arctic provinces. The regions\r\nembraced in the several climatic provinces named above, as well as their\r\nhumid and arid divisions, so far as now understood, are shown on the\r\naccompanying map.\r\n\r\n_The Tropical Province_ (Plate III).--This is the most southern of the\r\nclimatic provinces which it is convenient to recognise in North America,\r\nand includes the West Indies, Central America, and southern Mexico,\r\ntogether with a narrow strip on each coast of northern Mexico and the\r\nextreme southern ends of the peninsulas of Florida and of Lower\r\nCalifornia. While the land areas in this widely extended province\r\npresent conspicuous differences, their climate in general is\r\ncharacterized by a high mean annual temperature with but moderate\r\nseasonal or daily variations, and by the occurrence in general of a wet\r\nand a dry season each year. The prevailing winds are the northeast\r\ntrades. While the average yearly temperature is high, being in general\r\nabout 80 deg. F., the heat in summer is less intense than in many portions\r\nof the austral provinces. In winter the temperature does not fall\r\nsufficiently to produce frost, except on the higher mountains, which, in\r\nfact, belong to one or more of the other provinces named above. On\r\nascending the mountains a rapid change to cooler and even to frigid\r\nzones is experienced. Snow occurs on the higher portions of the\r\nmountains of Central America and Mexico, and in a few instances, as on\r\nthe great volcanic cones in sight from the City of Mexico, is perennial.\r\nOn the mountains just referred to all of the several climatic provinces\r\nare represented by well-characterized zones, arranged one above another,\r\nand presenting in epitome the general changes one would experience in\r\ntravelling from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nIn marked contrast to the prevailing uniformity of temperature at\r\ncorresponding elevations throughout the tropical provinces is the\r\ninequality in rainfall in reference to both seasonal periods and\r\ndifferences in geographical position. Of the annual changes, the\r\nmost pronounced and characteristic is the alternation of wet and dry\r\nperiods. During the summer season, or in general from May to October,\r\nthe air is usually clouded for at least a portion of each day, and heavy\r\ndownpours of rain occur. Throughout the remainder of the year the clear\r\nskies and refreshing breezes, such as on the ocean are normally\r\ncharacteristic of the trade-wind belt, prevail. The remarkable\r\nregularity with which these changes occur each year suggests at once\r\nthat they are due to the migrations northward and southward with the sun\r\nof the great climatic belts encircling the equatorial region of the\r\nearth. In summer the equatorial belt of calms and heavy rainfall not\r\nonly migrates northward and occupies a portion of Central America,\r\nbringing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua cloudy skies and abundant\r\nprecipitation, but seems to be carried bodily still farther northward,\r\nso that the influence of the southeast trades of the southern hemisphere\r\nmakes itself felt, and four somewhat well-marked annual changes occur,\r\nnamely, two wet and two dry seasons. What is known of the climate of\r\nthis extreme southern portion of the province under review indicates\r\nthat the seasonal changes, especially on the Caribbean slope, are less\r\nwell marked than in its central portion, and rain is frequently copious\r\nin nearly every month of the year. In the region just mentioned the mean\r\nannual precipitation, as at Greytown, for example, at the eastern\r\nextremity of the proposed Nicaragua Canal, is about 250 inches, and in\r\nexceptionally wet years reaches nearly or quite 300 inches. This is, so\r\nfar as known, the heaviest annual precipitation in any portion of North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies the rainy season begins, in general, in May and lasts\r\nuntil October. On the lowlands of eastern and south-central Mexico the\r\nwet season commences in June, and the rains increase until the end of\r\nJuly and end in November. This region lies to the north of the northern\r\nlimit reached by the equatorial belt of calm, but the rains in the\r\nsummer season are due to the same general influence, namely, the\r\nlowering of temperature in the northward-moving upper air-currents, and\r\ntheir effect on the trade-winds. In Cuba and along the northern\r\ncoast of the Gulf of Mexico when the trade-wind belt migrates southward\r\nin winter the influences of the southward-moving storm from the\r\nMississippi Valley and Atlantic States produces what are termed\r\n_northers_, which bring a chill and at times frost, more especially in\r\nFlorida and on the higher portions of Cuba.\r\n\r\nWhile the wide-reaching seasonal changes within the tropical province\r\ndepend on the migrations of the planetary winds northward and southward\r\nwith the sun, and are due primarily to astronomical conditions, there\r\nare equally well-marked variations in rainfall dependent on or regulated\r\nby geographical conditions. These are of two principal classes: First,\r\nelevation of the land; and second, the relation of broad land areas to\r\nthe direction of the prevailing winds, each of which is abundantly\r\nillustrated in the tropical province.\r\n\r\nThe mountainous islands in the West Indies receive a heavy rainfall,\r\nespecially on their windward or easterly slopes, while the low islands,\r\nand less markedly the southwestern border of the higher islands, are\r\nmuch less humid. The eastern side of Porto Rico, for example, has an\r\nabundant rainfall, and was originally clothed with a luxuriant native\r\nflora, including large forest-trees, while the lowlands on its southern\r\nand southwestern border are subject to drought, and irrigation is\r\ndesirable to insure the growth of crops. Again, while the mountainous\r\nislands of the Lesser Antilles, with their luxuriantly forested slopes,\r\npresent ideal pictures of tropical loveliness, low-lying Sombrero,\r\nBarbuda, St. Martin, and other similar islands are so arid that guano\r\nhas accumulated on them to such an extent as to be of commercial\r\nimportance. The reason for these striking contrasts within narrow\r\ngeographical limits is readily seen in the influence of the highlands on\r\nthe trade-winds. These air-currents blowing from the Atlantic are warm\r\nand contain a high percentage of moisture. As they advance, however,\r\nthey invade regions that are progressively warmer and warmer, and the\r\ncapacity of the air for moisture is correspondingly increased. For this\r\nreason the trade-winds in crossing low land become drying winds.\r\nWhen the warm humid air-currents are forced upward, however, they are\r\ncooled in part by contact with the land, but to a greater extent on\r\naccount of expansion due to decreased pressure; the dew-point is thus\r\nlowered, and when saturation is reached precipitation follows. This\r\nexplanation applies also to the low peninsula of Yucatan, which is\r\nwithin the trade-wind belt, and is exceptional among the lands of\r\nCentral America, on account of its dearth of forests, but in this\r\ninstance, and also in reference to the similar barren condition of the\r\nBahama Islands, in addition to the lowness of the land, the influence of\r\nthe underlying porous, limestone rocks on the vegetable growths should\r\nbe considered. In the instances just mentioned the rain that falls is\r\nquickly absorbed by the cavernous rocks, and surface streams are rare.\r\n\r\nIn Central America the influence of mountains on the climate is much the\r\nsame as in the West India islands; in fact, the narrow rugged belt of\r\nland connecting the two Americas may, from our present point of view, be\r\nconsidered as a great island situated mainly within the trade-wind belt,\r\nand similar to Jamaica, for example, in its influences on the winds\r\nblowing across it. The eastern slopes of the Central American mountains,\r\ntogether with the adjacent lowlands, with the exception, principally, of\r\nYucatan, are well watered and clothed with dense vegetation, while on\r\nthe western slopes, and especially over the narrow fringe of lowland\r\nadjacent to the Pacific, the rainfall is less than on the Caribbean\r\ncoast, and the forests are open with many grass-covered areas which are\r\nfavourable for agriculture. In the mountainous portions of the West\r\nIndies and of Central America, on account of the more healthy conditions\r\non the leeward or drier sides, as compared with the windward or humid\r\nslopes of the mountains, the towns and the principal portion of the\r\nwhite inhabitants are located on their western borders. Owing to the\r\ngreat humidity and the long-continued high temperature during the hotter\r\nportion of the year throughout the tropical province, much of the\r\nlowland to the eastward of the high mountains is swampy and unhealthy.\r\nThis low region in Mexico and Central America is known as the\r\n_tierra caliente_, or hot country; on the mountains and plateaus, or in\r\ngeneral where the elevation is between 5,000 and 7,000 feet, is the\r\ncooler and remarkably salubrious _tierra templada_; and at still higher\r\nelevations occur the _tierra frie_. Owing to the decrease in temperature\r\nwith elevation, and the fact that the moist warm air is forced to rise,\r\nand in consequence expands on passing over the highland, the rainfall\r\nprobably increases with elevation through the three zones just referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\nWhile the tropical province is characterized by the uniformity with\r\nwhich its atmospheric changes occur, it is nevertheless in part subject\r\nto occasional and exceedingly violent cyclonic storms termed hurricanes,\r\nwhich begin in the torrid zone, travel northward (Fig. 26, page 210),\r\nand make their influence felt in more than one of the climatic provinces\r\ninto which North America is here divided. Thunder-storms, frequently of\r\ngreat violence, also occur, especially in the Central American region in\r\nsummer, when the doldrums migrate northward.\r\n\r\nThe trade-wind belt broadens in crossing the southern portion of the\r\nNorth American continent, and on the west coast and during its greatest\r\nnorthward migration reaches to southern California. As we have seen, the\r\nlowlands not adjacent to mountains in the Caribbean region receive\r\nlittle or no rain from the trade-winds, for the reason that the\r\nprevailing air-currents are moving from cooler to warmer regions, and\r\ntherefore have their capacity for moisture increased as they advance\r\nmore rapidly than their thirst can be satiated. The trade-winds are thus\r\nnormally drying winds. The same principle holds true for continents as\r\nwell as islands. The trade-winds on reaching the eastern border of the\r\nMexican plateau are forced upward and part with much of their moisture\r\nin the form of rain and snow, and on descending to the lower lands\r\nbordering the Pacific are desiccating winds. The conditions are thus\r\nmuch the same as on the lowlands situated to the leeward of the\r\nmountains of the West Indies. The narrow fringe of low-lying country on\r\nthe west border of the main body of Mexico, together with the\r\npeninsula of Lower California and a portion of the southern extremity of\r\nCalifornia, are arid, although in immediate proximity to the ocean. The\r\nleading characteristics of the climate of this, the arid portion of the\r\ntropical province, are its small rainfall, clear atmosphere, high mean\r\nannual temperature, moderate seasonal changes, and active evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe most typical portion of the arid region bordering the Pacific from\r\nCalifornia southward lies in northwestern Mexico, where the mean annual\r\nprecipitation on the western slope of the central table-land is from 15\r\nto 20 inches, but gradually diminishes as one descends to the lower\r\nlands to the westward to 10 inches, and even to 5 inches or less. A\r\ngreat portion of the lowlands is practically a desert, although, as is\r\ncommon on the desert-like tracts of this continent, it is sparingly\r\ncovered with detached clumps of cacti, yuccas, and other similar plants\r\nwhich live with the minimum of water.\r\n\r\nThe hot, arid lands of the southwest just referred to are similar in\r\nposition, in reference to the relation of land areas to the trade-wind\r\nbelts, as other trade-wind deserts, as they are termed, such as the\r\nSahara, which occur on the leeward side of continents where they are\r\ncrossed by these drying winds.\r\n\r\n_The Lower Austral Province_ (Plate III).--This province embraces the\r\nAtlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States from Connecticut\r\nsouthward, with the exception of the tropical portion of southern\r\nFlorida; the Mississippi basin south of the mouth of the Ohio; and\r\nincludes also many of the valleys amid the Pacific mountains from the\r\nnorthern boundary of California to central Mexico. The larger\r\ngeographical conditions on which the boundaries of the province depend\r\nare the warm currents in the Atlantic, which ameliorate the temperature\r\nof the adjacent land as well as supply it with abundant moisture; the\r\nlow elevation of the central continental basin, which permits of great\r\nextension northward of the climatic conditions originating about the\r\nGulf of Mexico; and the mountainous character of the western portion of\r\nthe province, where the valleys have a markedly different\r\ntemperature and rainfall from the highlands.\r\n\r\nThe most southern portions of the lower austral province within the\r\nborder of the United States has a semitropical climate and is\r\ncharacterized by its high mean annual temperature, abundant rainfall,\r\nand uniformity of weather conditions throughout the year. The summers\r\nare hot, but tempered by winds from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic,\r\nand the winters, although normally mild and without snow, are varied at\r\nintervals by periods of cold which bring occasional frosts. This\r\nsemitropical division of the lower austral province embraces a narrow\r\nstrip of coast-land extending from South Carolina to southeastern Texas,\r\nwith the exception of the extreme southern end of Florida, and forms a\r\ntransition between the hotter and more humid tropical province to the\r\nsouthward and the cooler and less humid region to the northward.\r\n\r\nAs the saying is, a tree is judged by its fruit; in a similar way we may\r\njudge of the climate of a region by its products. The Gulf strip of the\r\nlower austral province is the home of a number of plants and animals not\r\nfound farther north, as, for example, the cabbage palmetto and Cuban\r\npine, and several species of birds and small mammals. Among the\r\nagricultural products of this narrow coastal belt which are suggestive\r\nof its climate are rice, sugar-cane, and sea-island cotton; of fruits it\r\nproduces, especially in Florida, oranges, mandarins, lemons, limes,\r\nshaddocks, and pineapples.\r\n\r\nThe humid portion of the lower austral province extends northward from\r\nthe Gulf strip, and presents a transition in climatic conditions between\r\nthe semitropical Gulf coast and the more markedly temperate climate of\r\nthe upper austral. This eastern division of the lower austral,\r\ncharacterized by its mild winters, general absence of snow, long hot\r\nsummers with abundant rain, extends from eastern Virginia southward\r\nabout the southern end of the Appalachian Mountains, and in the\r\nMississippi Valley broadens so as to reach the mouth of the Ohio River.\r\nIts western limit is in central Texas, where the mean annual rainfall\r\ndecreases to less than 20 inches, and forests give place to\r\ntreeless, grass-covered plains and plateaus.\r\n\r\nThrough this eastern portion of the lower austral the mean annual\r\nprecipitation is in general between 50 and 60 inches, and is so\r\ndistributed throughout the year that each month receives approximately\r\nan equal share. In general, however, the rainfall is greater in winter\r\nthan in summer. The mean annual temperature of the humid portion of the\r\nlower austral is from 60 deg. to 68 deg. F., the mean winter temperature 40 deg. to\r\n52 deg., and the mean summer temperature from 75 deg. to 80 deg. F. From these\r\nrecords it may be inferred that the conditions are favourable for the\r\ngrowth of trees. In its natural condition this entire region was clothed\r\nwith a varied and beautiful forest, consisting largely of broad-leaved\r\ntrees, but is also the home of the southern pine and the cypress. The\r\ncharacteristic crops are cotton and corn (maize).\r\n\r\nThe western or arid portion of the lower austral province embraces\r\nwestern Texas, a large area in northeastern Mexico, and circling about\r\nthe southern extremity of the Pacific mountains in central Mexico,\r\nextends northward adjacent to the tropical border of the Pacific and the\r\nGulf of Lower California, into Arizona and southern California. A\r\ndetached area of this same province occupies the great Valley of\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nThe leading feature in the climate of the extensive and irregular region\r\njust outlined is its aridity. The rainfall is too small to insure forest\r\ngrowths; the land is treeless, except along the streams, and irrigation\r\nis necessary for successful agriculture. With a sufficient amount of\r\nwater for irrigation, a great variety of fruits, etc., may be raised,\r\nincluding many products usually considered as indicating tropical\r\nconditions, such as mangoes, dates, figs, citrus fruits, olives,\r\npineapples, etc. Not only are the agricultural products numerous and\r\nvaried, but the yield per acre under the most favourable conditions is\r\nfar in excess of the best results reached in most regions where rain is\r\nrelied on to furnish the requisite moisture. Under the prevailingly\r\ncloudless skies of the hot arid lands of the southwestern portion\r\nof the continent insolation is intense and the growth of vegetation\r\nphenomenal when the necessary amount of water is supplied. The land in\r\nits present condition presents great contrasts, ranging from desolate,\r\nsun-burned tracts which are almost absolute deserts, to the vivid green\r\nof irrigated fields and the deep shade of heavily fruit-laden orchards.\r\n\r\n_The Upper Austral Province_ (Plate III).--The portion of North\r\nAmerica embraced in this climatic province lies principally in the\r\ncentral part of the United States, but includes also a narrow strip in\r\nsouthern Ontario, adjacent to the north shore of Lake Erie, and a large\r\nirregular area in the central plateau of Mexico. A marked feature of its\r\ngeography is its extreme irregularity in the portion occupied by the\r\nPacific mountains in the United States and Mexico. The reasons for this\r\nlie mainly in the influence of the relief of the land on climate, the\r\ndirection of the prevailing winds, and varying distances from the ocean.\r\nIt is a familiar fact that boreal and even arctic climatic conditions\r\nare met with on high mountains. The attention that is given to changes\r\nin climate with increase in altitude is no doubt largely due to the fact\r\nthat the mountains present conditions which are exceptional and more or\r\nless novel as seen from our accustomed point of view. A person living in\r\nan elevated region, on descending into a deep valley, would be impressed\r\nwith the reverse order in which the climatic zones occur. In making such\r\na descent he would pass in succession from a boreal or perhaps arctic\r\nclimate, through a transitional or cold temperate, to the warm temperate\r\nor upper austral province, and might even reach the semitropical\r\ndivision of the lower austral. In the Pacific mountains within the\r\nborder of the United States the valleys are sufficiently deep to have\r\nthe climatic conditions here ascribed to the upper austral, and in the\r\nsouthwestern portion of the United States descents may be made--as in\r\nthe Great Valley of California and in the arid basins of southern\r\nNevada, Arizona, etc.--sufficiently great to reach the lower austral.\r\nThe valleys amid the Pacific mountains, which fall in the upper austral\r\nprovince, are in general low at the north in reference to\r\nsea-level, and become higher and higher at the south. For example, the\r\nupper austral region in central Washington is but 400 or 500 feet above\r\nthe sea, while in Mexico it lies in general at an altitude of between\r\n4,000 and 6,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe upper austral province may be termed warm temperate, with a marked\r\ncontrast between the heat of summer and the cold of winter. The summers\r\nare long, with an average temperature of 70 deg. or 75 deg., while the winters\r\nare variable, with frequent cold periods when ice forms and snow-storms\r\nare not rare. The snow seldom remains on the ground for more than a few\r\ndays at a time, however, except in the northeast, where the warm\r\ntemperate climatic conditions of the province under review merge with\r\nthose of the colder region to the northward embraced in the transition\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nThe upper, like the lower austral, presents two well-marked divisions in\r\nreference to humidity--an eastern or humid and a western or semihumid\r\nportion; the dividing line is in the neighbourhood of the one hundredth\r\nmeridian. In the eastern division the mean annual precipitation in the\r\nPiedmont region to the east of the Appalachians and on the coastal plain\r\nadjacent to the Atlantic in Maryland and New Jersey is from 40 to 80\r\ninches, but decreases westward, and on the border of the Great plateaus\r\nin Kansas and Nebraska is about 20 inches. In the western division the\r\nannual precipitation is less than 20 inches, and agriculture without\r\nirrigation is uncertain and usually impossible. To the east of the one\r\nhundredth meridian the rain is somewhat evenly distributed throughout\r\nthe year, although an increasing dryness of the summer is easily\r\ndetected as one travels from east to west, but in the various upper\r\naustral valleys of the Pacific mountain region the precipitation is\r\nmostly during the winter, and the summers are practically rainless. The\r\nmarked difference in precipitation between the humid and semihumid\r\ndivision of the upper austral province is recorded on the surface of the\r\nland by the vegetation. In the eastern division the entire region, with\r\nthe exception of the prairies in the central part of the Mississippi\r\nbasin, was originally clothed with a varied and beautiful forest,\r\nconsisting mainly of broad-leaved trees, such as the hickory, maple,\r\noak, etc., while the semihumid western division is treeless, except in\r\nimmediate proximity to streams.\r\n\r\nIn the southern portion of the humid division of the upper austral\r\nprovince cotton is one of the staple products, but the northern limit of\r\nthe region in which it can be successfully cultivated is soon reached as\r\none travels northward. Tobacco is grown extensively in the southeastern\r\nand eastern portions of the province. The principal crop of the great\r\ncentral area in the Mississippi Valley is corn (maize). Successful wheat\r\nculture begins in the northern portion of the province, but the\r\nconditions favouring its cultivation increase to the northward and it\r\nbecomes the characteristic and most valuable crop of the transition\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nIn the western or semihumid division of the upper austral the variety of\r\nagricultural products that can be successfully cultivated with the aid\r\nof irrigation is greater than in its eastern portion, where irrigation\r\nis not generally practised. The northern limit at which tobacco, fruits,\r\nthe vine, etc., may be advantageously cultivated in the west is greater\r\nthan in the east. For example, in the east the northern limit at which\r\ntobacco is raised on a commercial scale is in Connecticut, while in the\r\nwest it reaches a large size and excellent quality in central\r\nWashington. Various fruits, such as the peach, pear, plum, grape, etc.,\r\nhave their northern limit of successful cultivation in the east in\r\nwestern New York, southern Ontario, and southern Michigan, a region\r\nfavourably influenced in this connection by the proximity of the Great\r\nLakes; in the west these same fruits reach a high degree of perfection,\r\nand are produced in great abundance, with the aid of irrigation, in\r\nnorth-central Washington, fully 5 degrees of latitude farther northward.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the upper austral province may be said to have a warm\r\ntemperate climate, in which the summer season is longer and more\r\npronounced in its characteristics than the winter season. It\r\npresents sufficient seasonal variations, however, to favour in a high\r\ndegree both the physical and intellectual development of man.\r\n\r\n_The Transition Province_ (Plate III).--This, the transition region\r\nbetween the austral and boreal provinces, includes the cool temperate\r\nportions of North America. Like the austral provinces, its outlines are\r\nirregular, and in places it occupies detached or island-like areas, on\r\naccount of the influence of mountains on climatic conditions. Its\r\nlargest continuous area is situated along the northern border of the\r\nUnited States, but includes the southern portions of Assiniboia,\r\nOntario, and Quebec, and extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.\r\nFrom this main belt there is a marked extension southward along the\r\nAppalachian Mountains, which carries a cool temperate climate into\r\nnorthern Georgia, and another and much greater southward extension along\r\nthe Pacific mountains, which reaches central Mexico. In the northern\r\nportion of the United States and adjacent parts of Canada, the region\r\nunder consideration has, in general, an elevation of 1,000 feet or even\r\nless above the sea, but it rises when followed southward along the\r\nmountains, and in the southwestern portion of the United States and on\r\nthe table-land of central Mexico attains an elevation of some 8,000 or\r\n9,000 feet. On the higher portions of the mountains of Central America\r\nand the West Indies the climatic conditions are similar to those of the\r\nregions farther north here included in the transition climatic province,\r\nbut these isolated areas are not sufficiently well known to be indicated\r\non the accompanying map.\r\n\r\nThe mean annual temperature of the transition province is lower than\r\nthat of the upper austral, and, although a precise average is not at\r\npresent attainable, may be taken at about 45 deg. F. The winters are long\r\nand cold, especially in the northern part of the United States and\r\nadjacent portions of Canada, the mean temperature being approximately\r\n20 deg. or 25 deg., but sudden and great variations are not uncommon. At times,\r\nand frequently for continuous periods of several days, the temperature\r\nfalls to 20 deg. or more below zero of the Fahrenheit scale, then again\r\nrises above freezing, and the frozen soil thaws and possibly\r\nbecomes entirely freed from ice.\r\n\r\nIn common with the austral provinces, the one under consideration is\r\ndivided into two portions, an eastern and a western, in reference to\r\nprecipitation, the dividing line being a little to the eastward of the\r\none hundredth meridian. While the western portion of the province is\r\ncharacterized by its small rainfall, precipitation is greater, mainly on\r\naccount of greater elevation, than in the adjacent portions of the\r\naustral provinces, and in Oregon and Washington there is a markedly\r\nhumid area.\r\n\r\nSnow falls throughout the entire transition province, at least during\r\nexceptional winters, and in general during every winter. There is great\r\nvariation in the depth of the snow from winter to winter, and also with\r\ngeographical position. It is greatest in the northeast--that is, from\r\nthe Atlantic coast westward to Wisconsin and Minnesota--and least on the\r\nPacific coast and the southern portion of the Pacific mountains. Over\r\nthe northeastern portion of the province the snow frequently whitens the\r\nground for weeks, and even for two or three months continuously. A deep\r\naccumulation which remains for a long time unmelted is welcome, as it\r\nprotects the roots of plants from sudden changes of temperature and\r\nprevents alternate freezing and thawing of their sap, which is injurious\r\nto their tissues in numerous instances. Great variation in the amount of\r\nsnow that falls annually in a given locality is of common occurrence. A\r\nlarge proportion of the yearly accumulation frequently occurs during one\r\nor two great storms. For example, in January and February, 1898, there\r\nwere two severe storms, accompanied by an unusual depth of snow, the\r\nfirst being most pronounced over New England, and the second in the\r\nregion of the Great Lakes. Other storms increased the amount of snow so\r\nthat at the beginning of March the average depth in Maine was 40 to 70\r\ninches, in New Hampshire and Vermont 10 to 40 inches, and in\r\nMassachusetts 10 to 20 inches, while in Michigan and Wisconsin the\r\ngeneral depth on level ground was 1 to 2 feet, with many drifts 10 to 15\r\nfeet deep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Ice-palace erected in Montreal, Canada, during\r\nthe winter of 1889.]\r\n\r\nThe winter in the northeastern portion of the transition province may be\r\nsaid to be the most characteristic feature of the climate, as it is the\r\none that is most pronounced and exceptional, when a comparison is made\r\nwith other thickly peopled portions of the continent. The period of cold\r\nand snow each year is long, extending in general from November to March,\r\nand the coming of the flowers and birds in spring is frequently much\r\ndelayed. The long cold winters have a decided influence on plant and\r\nanimal life, and in a marked way modify the lives of men. In the\r\nnortheastern portion of the United States and adjacent provinces of\r\nCanada various forms of sleighs are extensively used during the winters,\r\nand skating on the frozen lakes and streams and excursions on snow-shoes\r\nover the fields and through the forests are a popular and healthful\r\nexercise, while coasting and tobogganing--or to explain these terms to\r\npeople living in regions where snow does not fall, the sliding down\r\nsteep snow- or ice-covered slopes on sleds or flat-bottomed\r\ntoboggans--are highly enjoyable sports indulged in by children and grown\r\npeople alike. In certain cities, notably Montreal and Quebec, what are\r\ntermed ice-palaces (Fig. 25) are built of blocks of ice and are utilized\r\nfor winter carnivals.\r\n\r\nThe summers throughout the transition province are hot, with little rain\r\nin the western portion, but refreshing showers and occasional\r\ndestructive storms in the humid eastern portion. Owing to the latitude\r\nof the main transcontinental belt of the province, the number of hours\r\nof sunlight each day in summer is increased beyond what it is in the\r\nmain portions of the austral provinces, thus favouring the growth of\r\nvegetation. There is also a lengthening of the morning and evening\r\nduration of twilight, and magnificent sunrises and sunsets are frequent.\r\nThe mean summer temperature is in the neighbourhood of 70 deg. F., but hot\r\nspells, lasting for days, and even weeks, are of common occurrence.\r\nDuring these trying and frequently unhealthy intervals the temperature\r\nin the shade reaches or even exceeds 100 deg. F., and sunstrokes or\r\nprostrations by reason of the heat, particularly in the cities, are\r\nnumerous. The four seasons of the year are better marked and have\r\nmore pronounced characteristics in this division of the continent than\r\nin any other, and it is the region of greatest seasonal climatic changes\r\nas well as of marked weekly and even daily variations in weather\r\nconditions. The most delightful months to most people are May, when the\r\nreturning migratory birds are nesting, the trees unfolding their many\r\ntinted leaves, and the air laden with the perfume of multitudes of\r\nblossoms, and October, when the rich colours of ripened leaves give to\r\nthe forests a marvellous variety and brilliancy of colour and the\r\ntranquil, hazy atmosphere is undisturbed by storms for days and even\r\nweeks together. This annual period of tranquil weather, extending\r\nfrequently far into November, is known as Indian summer.\r\n\r\nIn the northern portion of the transition province the broad-leaved,\r\ndeciduous trees of the central and eastern portions of the United States\r\nreach their northern limit, and become mingled with a southward\r\nextension of the conifers which form the major portion of the forest of\r\nCanada. A similar but less marked change occurs among the Pacific\r\nmountains, where the scattered growths of oaks, pinyon pines, sycamores,\r\netc., of the lower mountain slopes and stream sides mingle with the\r\nspruces and yellow and white pines of the more elevated region, where\r\nthe climate is similar to that of central Canada. As remarked by\r\nMerriam, the province as a whole is characterized by comparatively few\r\ndistinctive animals or plants, but rather by the occurrence together of\r\nsouthern species which there find their northern limit and northern\r\nspecies which there reach their southern limit. It embraces the northern\r\nportion of the truly agricultural lands of the continent. The plants of\r\neconomic importance which there reach their highest stage of perfection\r\nare wheat, oats, and other cereals, the sugar-beet, numerous vegetables,\r\nthe white potato, apples in great variety and abundance, cherries,\r\nplums, grapes, etc. It is the northern limit of corn, and includes\r\nnearly the entire area in which maple-sugar is produced. In the eastern\r\nportion of the province several varieties of native nuts, such as the\r\nbeechnut, butternut, chestnut, hazelnut, hickory-nut, walnut,\r\netc., grow wild and in great abundance; but nut-bearing hardwood trees\r\nare also a characteristic feature of the forests of the humid portion of\r\nthe austral provinces.\r\n\r\nIn the western division of the province a humid area--embracing western\r\nWashington and Oregon, part of northern California, including the Coast\r\nRange of the same States--presents a marked contrast to the more widely\r\nextended and excessively irregular arid portion which surrounds the\r\nhigher mountains and is for the most part remote from the ocean. Both\r\nthe humid and arid divisions of the western part of the province are\r\nalike favourable for agriculture, as is shown by the vast and highly\r\nproductive wheat-fields of the semihumid eastern portion of the States\r\njust named and the productive hop lands, orchards, and vineyards of\r\ntheir humid western portions.\r\n\r\nThe climate of a great land area not only finds expression in its fauna\r\nand flora, but in the industries and the intellectual development of its\r\npeople. While it is difficult to translate man's physical and\r\nintellectual development into terms of climate, it is evident that the\r\ntransition province favours both bodily and mental activity more than\r\nany of the other climatic provinces into which North America is here\r\ndivided. Although the boundary between the upper austral and the\r\ntransition provinces is indefinite, it is easily to be seen, from the\r\ngeographical distribution of cities, agricultural population,\r\nmanufactories, colleges, and other institutions of learning, etc., that\r\nthe climate of the province under review is on the whole the one in\r\nwhich the greatest intellectual advance has been made and the one which\r\nholds out the greatest promise for the future.\r\n\r\n_The Boreal Province_ (Plate III).--This climatic division of North\r\nAmerica extends in a broad belt diagonally across the continent from the\r\neastern portion of Labrador nearly to the shore of Bering Sea, and is\r\nrepresented by detached areas in both the Atlantic and Pacific mountains\r\nfar beyond its general southern limit. Its northern border, in the\r\nContinental basin, is marked by the cessation of forests, and on the\r\nmountains to the southward its upper limit coincides with the\r\ntimber-line. Its leading climatic features are its low mean\r\nannual temperature--in general from 32 deg. to 40 deg. F.--its long, cold\r\nwinters, and short, hot summers. The differences in mean annual\r\nprecipitation in various parts of the province are less marked than in\r\nthe several provinces previously noticed, but in the far north a cold\r\narid division should be recognised. Although but few direct measures of\r\nprecipitation are available for comparison, our general knowledge of the\r\ngreat boreal province and the character of its vegetation indicate that\r\nthere is a decrease in precipitation from both the eastern and western\r\nborders of the continent towards the interior, and also from its central\r\nportion both northward and southward. The heaviest precipitation is on\r\nthe Pacific coast, from California northward to southern Alaska, and the\r\nlightest precipitation is probably in the central Continental basin,\r\nnear the northern limit of the province. Precipitation on the Pacific\r\ncoast at low elevations is almost entirely in the form of rain, but on\r\nthe mountains there is in winter deep snow which remains for a number of\r\nmonths unmelted. Throughout the portion of the province included in\r\nCanada and Alaska the snowfall is abundant, but heaviest towards the\r\nAtlantic coast. Along the northern margin of the province, as indicated\r\nby observations at a small number of stations, not only is the mean\r\nannual precipitation light, probably under 20 inches, but the winter\r\nsnow is not deep, although it remains on the ground continuously for\r\nfive or six months. In the main or northern portion of the boreal\r\nprovince, owing to the comparatively high latitude, the variation in the\r\nnumber of hours of light and darkness each day during a year becomes\r\nconspicuous. In summer the sun is above the horizon from eighteen to\r\ntwenty-four hours each day, and in winter the hours of darkness are\r\ncorrespondingly increased. The year is divided into but two seasons,\r\nsummer and winter, the distinctive features of spring and fall, so well\r\nmarked in the upper austral and transition provinces, disappearing. On\r\naccount of the low mean annual temperature, and especially because of\r\nthe shortness of the growing season, agriculture is of small importance.\r\nAlong its southern border, more especially in southeastern Canada and\r\nNewfoundland, such small fruits as currants, huckleberries,\r\nraspberries, blackberries, cranberries, etc., grow wild and yield\r\nabundant returns when cultivated. In favoured localities white potatoes,\r\nturnips, beets, and certain varieties of the apple, as well as the more\r\nhardy cereals, are cultivated with moderate success.\r\n\r\n_The Arctic Province_ (Plate III) comprises the cold, treeless plains\r\nsloping to the Arctic Ocean and the summits of the higher mountains at\r\nthe south which rise above the transition province. The one controlling\r\nclimatic feature is the low temperature, the mean for each year being\r\n32 deg. F. or lower. The winters are longer and more severe than in the\r\nboreal province, and the summers short and hot. Insolation, on account\r\nof the length of the days in summer of the main area of the province and\r\nthe free exposure on the mountain summits to the southward, is intense,\r\nbut its beneficial effect on vegetation is largely counterbalanced by\r\nthe influence of the lingering snow and ice. In the mountainous regions\r\nof North America the arctic province is the birthplace of numerous\r\nglaciers. Although destitute of trees, the arctic, or arctic-alpine\r\nprovince, as it may be termed, is rendered glorious in numberless\r\nlocalities by the profusion and brilliancy of its flowering annuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                SECONDARY DISTURBANCES OF THE ATMOSPHERE\r\n\r\nIn the broad, general movements of the atmosphere over North America\r\nembraced in what are termed the planetary and continental winds there\r\nare many disturbances due to more or less local changes in conditions,\r\nthe most conspicuous of which are whirlwinds, chinook winds,\r\nthunder-storms, tornadoes, cyclones, and hurricanes. While some of these\r\ndisturbances are local, as the whirlwind and tornadoes, and may not\r\nextend beyond the boundaries of the particular climatic provinces where\r\nthey originate, others, as the cyclones and hurricanes, may affect the\r\nclimate of several provinces.\r\n\r\n_Whirlwind._--A conspicuous, although minor feature in the atmospheric\r\nphenomena of the hot, dry plains and valleys, especially of the\r\nMexican plateau and the Great Basin, and less markedly of the Great\r\nplateau to the east of the Rocky Mountains, is the occurrence of small\r\nwhirlwinds which carry dust and light objects into the air in spiral\r\ncolumns that are not infrequently 2,000 or 3,000 feet high, and have a\r\ndiameter of perhaps 50 to 100 feet. These small whirls of the air, in\r\nwhich some of the characteristic features of the intensely active\r\ntornadoes and widely destructive tropical hurricanes can be studied on a\r\nsmall scale, occur most commonly during hot summer afternoons, when from\r\na commanding station half a dozen or more swaying columns may be seen\r\nmoving in various directions over the parched valleys and sun-scorched\r\nplains. These columns not only move in various directions, showing that\r\nthey are not due to the same immediate cause, but have different\r\ninternal motions, some whirling from right to left, and others in the\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\nThe generally accepted explanation of these small whirlwinds is that the\r\nair over the surface of the deserts, which are frequently almost bare of\r\nvegetation and perhaps white with saline incrustations, becomes locally\r\nhighly heated, especially when there is little or no wind, and is forced\r\nupward by the inflow of the surrounding cooler and heavier air. The\r\ninflowing currents have different velocities, and on meeting the\r\nstrongest one gives a rotary or spiral motion to the ascending column,\r\nwhich acts like a chimney in allowing the escape upward of the hot air\r\nfrom below. A central vertical line frequently seen in the dust columns\r\nshows that a core of comparatively still air is present, about which the\r\ndust-charged air rises in a spiral course. If the conditions just\r\noutlined should be greatly increased in magnitude some of the leading\r\nfeatures of tornadoes and even of hurricanes would be produced. In\r\nshort, all of the winds cited above, except the chinook, are concentric,\r\nswirling movements in ascending air, due primarily to a local increase\r\nin temperature at the lower portion of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n_Chinook Winds._--On the Great plateaus adjacent to the Rocky Mountains,\r\nand in similar situations to the eastward of the Sierra Nevada\r\nand Cascade Mountains, warm, drying winds frequently occur, especially\r\nin winter, when they bring a balminess as of spring. The remarkable\r\nfeature of these interesting winds is that they come from the snow-clad\r\nmountains, but are warm and dry in contrast with the preceding condition\r\nof the air on the plains. The capacity of the air brought by these winds\r\nfor moisture is so great that evaporation is active, and the snow in the\r\nvalleys and over the broad plains disappears without visible melting.\r\nThe change in the previously winter aspect of a region within the\r\ninfluence of these _chinook_ winds, as they are termed, is truly\r\nsurprising, and to their influence is due to a marked extent the value\r\nof the Great plateaus as stock-ranges, for the reason that the snow is\r\nremoved from them so as to allow cattle to feed on the naturally dried\r\ngrasses.\r\n\r\nThe chinook winds are the counterpart of the _foehn_ winds of\r\nSwitzerland, and are explained on the principle that descending air is\r\nmade more dense by the increased pressure to which it is subjected, and\r\nits temperature correspondingly raised, its capacity for moisture being\r\nat the same time increased on account of its rise in temperature. The\r\napparent anomaly of a warm, dry wind blowing from a snow-clad mountain\r\nrange is no longer a mystery, if we consider that the air is drawn over\r\nthe mountains towards a centre of low barometrical pressure owing to the\r\nwide-reaching influence of a cyclonic storm or other large atmospheric\r\nmovement. The air as it rises in order to cross a mountain is cooled,\r\nlargely on account of relief of pressure, and parts with a portion,\r\npossibly a large portion, of its moisture, which condenses on the\r\nmountain commonly as snow; on passing the mountain the air descends and\r\nis warmed by compression, and having less moisture than before, becomes\r\na drying wind, which produces the sudden and surprising changes on the\r\nplains and valleys to the leeward.\r\n\r\nThe chinook winds of the western portion of Canada and the United States\r\noccur principally to the eastward of high mountains, for the reason that\r\nthe prevailing air-currents of that region are from the west.\r\n\r\n_Thunder-Storms._--In the eastern portion of the United States and\r\nadjacent parts of Canada during the summer season the heating of the\r\nlower portion of the atmosphere, especially on still, sultry afternoons,\r\ncauses ascending currents of warm, moist air, which become cooled as\r\nthey rise, and give origin to vast masses of cumulus clouds. These\r\nmagnificent \"thunder-heads,\" as they are sometimes termed, illuminated\r\nby the full sunlight are most magnificent, and usually herald the coming\r\nof heavy showers, accompanied by frequently destructive lightning and\r\nheavy thunder. The bases of the clouds when seen from a distance are\r\nusually horizontal and may have curtain-like festoons beneath, due to\r\nfalling rain; while aloft the white vapour boils upward in fleece-like\r\nmasses, revealing a strong convectional ascent of moist air. The\r\nimmediate cause of a thunder-storm is the rapid ascent of a column of\r\nwarm moist air, which becomes cooled as it rises and the moisture\r\ncontained in it condensed. The cause of the ascent of the air column, at\r\nleast over plains and plateaus, is the heating of the air in contact\r\nwith the earth. A layer of warm, and consequently light, air beneath a\r\nlayer of cooler and heavier air furnishes unstable conditions which\r\nfavour an overturning and an escape upward of the lighter air, which is\r\nforced to ascend much as the hot air in a chimney is made to flow upward\r\nby the pressure of cooler and heavier air around. The conditions\r\npreceding a thunder-storm are a stagnant atmosphere over a broad region\r\nwhere the lower layer of hot air is also charged with moisture. These\r\nconditions are frequently fulfilled on the plains of the Atlantic slope\r\nand southeastern portion of the continental basin in summer when warm\r\nmoist air is drawn in from the Gulf region towards the centre of an area\r\nof low atmospheric pressure, and thunder-storms are there a\r\ncharacteristic feature. The storms usually advance northeastward, the\r\ndirection being determined by the flow of upper air-currents, and move\r\nover the country with a breadth of from 10 to perhaps 100 miles, and\r\nsend down copious supplies of refreshing rain.\r\n\r\nOver the Great plateaus the air near the earth's surface is\r\nhighly heated during the summer season, but it is deficient in moisture,\r\nand thunder-storms are rare, except for a brief period in late summer or\r\nfall when the normal conditions are disturbed.\r\n\r\nThunder-storms are almost unknown in the great Canadian-Alaska province\r\nand along the cool and humid northwest coast. They are also of rare\r\noccurrence in the hot and dry atmosphere of the Great Basin and Mexican\r\nplateau, but when they do come are of marked intensity, and pass under\r\nthe name of \"cloudbursts.\" At the far south, in the region brought under\r\nthe influence of the equatorial belt of calm, thunder-storms are\r\nfrequent and of great intensity.\r\n\r\nAn upward ascent of warm moist air, in much the same manner as described\r\nabove, occurs about isolated mountains, particularly in the southern\r\nportion of the Rocky Mountain chain, and summer thunder-storms are there\r\nof frequent occurrence, especially in the afternoon, about the higher\r\nmountain-peaks, while the adjacent valleys are flooded with sunlight.\r\nReference to this most striking phenomenon has already been made in\r\ndescribing the Park Mountain.\r\n\r\n_Tornadoes._--The fierce circular whirls in the air producing pendent,\r\nspirally twisting clouds, which when they touch the earth are of such\r\nintensity as to sweep away houses, trees, and nearly everything in their\r\npaths, are known to meteorologists as tornadoes, although popularly, but\r\nerroneously, termed cyclones. Storms of this character are of frequent\r\noccurrence in the United States to the east of the Great plateau, and\r\nare most numerous in the Mississippi Valley. Their path of destruction\r\nis seldom over half a mile wide, and as a rule they progress towards the\r\nnortheast, in obedience to the movement of the upper air-currents, at a\r\nrate of from 20 to 40 miles an hour, and may cut a swath from a few\r\nmiles to 20 or more miles long through forests, farms, villages, and\r\ntowns. They occur usually in the afternoon, and sometimes in the earlier\r\nhours of the night, of warm, sultry days, especially in spring and early\r\nsummer, but are not strictly confined to that portion of the\r\nyear. The conditions which precede the coming of a tornado are, in\r\ngeneral, the same as those in advance of a thunder-storm--that is, an\r\nindraft of hot, moist air beneath a cooler layer, thus establishing\r\nunstable conditions. An upward draft is started, the intensity of which\r\nbecomes so great that the inflowing winds are given a rapid spiral\r\nmotion about a calm centre. The tornado may be considered as a fully\r\ndeveloped or exceptionally energetic thunder-storm, in which a spiral\r\nmovement is established as in desert whirlwinds. The conditions for the\r\norigin of this class of dreaded and locally most destructive storms are\r\nbest fulfilled in the central portion of the Mississippi basin, where\r\nthey are somewhat frequent. They occur less commonly over the country to\r\nthe eastward, and are unknown in the more northern and western climatic\r\nprovinces, and, so far as the writer is aware, they have not been\r\nreported from the region to the north of the United States.\r\n\r\n_Cyclones._--This name is applied to the great atmospheric disturbances\r\nmarked by an inflowing of air towards a centre of low barometric\r\npressure from adjacent regions, commonly several hundred miles across,\r\nand an escape and overflow aloft. As in whirlwinds and tornadoes, there\r\nis a spiral movement established in the inflowing currents, but owing to\r\nthe large size of the area of low pressure, this seldom reaches\r\ndestructive violence. Cyclonic storms are of common occurrence,\r\nespecially in the temperate zone, and bring to that region its\r\ncharacteristic diversity of weather. Most of the rain and snow-storms of\r\nthe continent are due to the vast swirls of the atmosphere about areas\r\nof low atmospheric pressure, which cause air-currents from different\r\ndirections and with different components of heat and moisture to move\r\nover the land.\r\n\r\nThe cyclonic storm of the Mississippi Valley, the Atlantic coast States,\r\nand southeastern Canada frequently originate in the Great plateau\r\nprovince, and are carried towards the Atlantic owing to the influence of\r\nthe eastward-blowing winds of the upper atmosphere. At times these\r\nstorms are of such magnitude and intensity that they cross the Atlantic\r\nand are observed in England and Scandinavia. The courses they\r\nfollow may be traced from day to day on the weather-maps issued by the\r\nUnited States Weather Bureau, and from the directions they are likely to\r\nfollow and the atmospheric conditions pertaining to their various parts\r\npredictions of surprising accuracy as to the changes which the weather\r\nin a given locality will experience can be made one or two days before\r\nthe changes occur.\r\n\r\n_Hurricanes._--Cyclonic storms of the general nature of the tornadoes,\r\nbut of vastly greater extent and intensity, originate occasionally\r\nduring the latter portion of the summer season over the tropical portion\r\nof the north Atlantic, move slowly westward to the vicinity of the\r\nLesser Antilles, where normally their courses bend northward, and then\r\nskirt the Atlantic coast of the United States and drift eastward under\r\nthe influence of the eastward-flowing upper air-currents, and not\r\ninfrequently make their influence felt in the western portion of Europe.\r\nOccasionally, on account of the presence of an area of high barometric\r\npressure to the north of Cuba, the course of one of these tropical\r\nhurricanes, as they are termed, is rendered irregular, and it passes\r\nover the Atlantic States or is deflected still more and crosses the Gulf\r\nof Mexico before reaching the border of the continent, as was the case\r\nin September, 1900, when a large part of Galveston was destroyed. The\r\nnormal paths of the tropical hurricanes as they approach the coast of\r\nthe United States and the exceptional course of the one which passed\r\nover Galveston, are indicated on the map forming Fig. 26.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Tracks of West Indian hurricanes.

Sept. 1-Sept. 11, 1900.]\r\n\r\nThe analogy of a tropical hurricane to a tornado has already been\r\nreferred to, but while a tornado may lay waste a tract of country\r\nperhaps half a mile wide, and in exceptional cases 20 to 30 miles in\r\nlength, a hurricane is from 200 to 300 miles in diameter, and may\r\ncontinue to be destructive, on account of the rapid inflow of air from\r\nthe periphery towards the centre, for 2,000 or 3,000 miles. The velocity\r\nof the spirally blowing winds which are the characteristic feature of\r\nthese great storms is frequently 100 miles or more per hour. In spite of\r\ntheir magnitude, however, the conditions leading to their origin and\r\ngrowth are essentially the same as in the case of tornadoes, and\r\neven of the much smaller whirlwinds. They have their birth where the\r\nmoist, still air above the ocean in the region of the doldrums at the\r\nseason when the equatorial belt of calms is farthest north, becomes\r\nhighly heated and rises on account of the pressing in of cooler and\r\nheavier air from adjacent regions. The ascending column is at first\r\ncarried slowly westward, in obedience to the general flow of the\r\natmosphere in the intertropical belt, and at the same time the currents\r\ncoming in from opposite directions give the ascending air a rotary\r\nmotion. As the currents from the northeast are stronger than those from\r\nother directions, this whirling motion is from right to left, or\r\nopposite to the movement of the hands of a watch. The whirling air\r\ncolumn extends into the upper atmosphere, and as it moves along past the\r\nWest Indies becomes influenced by the prevalent flow of the upper\r\nair-currents, and is carried northwestward, and later eastward in a path\r\nwhich approximates to a parabolic curve. The inward-rushing spiral winds\r\nleave a calm centre, the \"eye of the storm,\" which corresponds to the\r\nhollow core of a whirlwind and the calm centre sometimes noted in\r\ntornadoes. The upward ascent of warm, humid air is accompanied by a\r\ndecrease of pressure and consequent expansion and cooling which leads to\r\nrapid condensation and a heavy downpour of rain; the change of the\r\nmoisture from a vaporous to a liquid form liberates heat, which serves\r\nto perpetuate the upward flow of air, and thus prolongs the life of the\r\nstorm. During the passage of the central area of low barometric pressure\r\nover a given locality the clouds frequently part and portions of the\r\nclear sky may be seen. Accompanying the rain are frequent lightning\r\nflashes, as during ordinary thunder-storms.\r\n\r\nThe tropical hurricanes are the most violent and most dreaded of all the\r\nstorms that sweep over any portion of our continent, but fortunately for\r\ndwellers on the land, are confined for the most part to the sea, since\r\nthe atmospheric conditions over the land lead to their loss of energy,\r\nalthough in rare instances they may be re-enforced by uniting with a\r\ncyclonic storm, as happened in the case of the Galveston hurricane, and\r\nthus continued after reaching the land. The destructiveness of the\r\nhurricanes at sea has been greatly lessened in recent years, not only on\r\naccount of the general use of steam as a motive power for vessels\r\ninstead of the wind, but because meteorologists can designate the time\r\nwhen they are likely to occur and the best method of sailing away\r\nfrom them if encountered. Since the establishment of the United States\r\nstations for observing and reporting the atmospheric conditions on the\r\nWest India islands, the approach of a hurricane can be foretold and\r\nwarning given to navigators and others of the coming danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EVAPORATION\r\n\r\nAn important element in climate is the amount of moisture the air\r\ncontains. The absolute amount of water vapour in a given volume of air\r\nis of interest in this connection, but what is of still greater\r\nimportance is the ratio of the amount of water vapour present to that\r\nwhich the air might contain, or what is termed the _relative humidity_.\r\nThe relative humidity, providing the actual amount of vapour present\r\nremains unchanged, depends upon the temperature of the atmosphere. For\r\nthis reason, the warming of an air-current, as the trade-winds, for\r\nexample, in which the water vapour present may, previous to the warming,\r\nhave approached saturation, causes it to have a still greater capacity,\r\nand hence decreases the relative humidity.\r\n\r\nThe winds in passing over the land may be either cooled or warmed, and\r\nhence their influence on evaporation is continually changing; but the\r\nmean rate of evaporation from an open water body can be determined for a\r\ndefinite time, say a year, for various localities, and thus afford a\r\nmeans of comparison between one region and another. Observation of the\r\nmean annual evaporation for various stations, mostly within the United\r\nStates, have been made, and the result shown by lines drawn through\r\nplaces where the rate is the same. A map showing this data, on which the\r\nfigures indicate the depth of evaporation in inches, is here presented.\r\nThe systematic study of evaporation, and especially the part played in\r\nit by plants, has scarcely more than been begun on this continent, and\r\nimportant results concerning its influence on atmospheric conditions are\r\nto be expected. The subject is also of great importance in reference to\r\nagriculture, the prevention of frost, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Depth of evaporation. After T.

From the torrid lowlands\r\nthe forests in general decrease in the variety and number of trees on a\r\ngiven area, both towards the north, where temperature becomes the\r\ncontrolling factor, and towards regions of small rainfall, where the\r\nleading adverse condition is deficiency of moisture. In the most highly\r\nfavoured localities the struggle for existence between species and\r\nspecies and individual with individual is intense, exposure to the\r\nlife-giving sunlight being the dominant aim of every one of the\r\ncontending hosts. As drier or colder regions are approached, but few\r\nspecies can survive and the forests are characterized by their monotony.\r\nWhere the conditions of heat and moisture are such that the existence of\r\na species is precarious, the balance of power, so to speak, passes to\r\nthe secondary conditions; and the texture and composition of the soil,\r\nslight differences in the relief of the land, and consequently in\r\ndrainage or in the degree of exposure to light, prevalence of fires,\r\netc., make themselves prominent and limit distribution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Map showing the distribution of forests in\r\nNorth America.]\r\n\r\nFrom a geographical point of view, the broadest features in the flora of\r\nNorth America are the forested and unforested areas. The distribution of\r\nthe forests, prairies, and treeless plains as they existed previous to\r\nthe coming of Europeans is shown on the accompanying map. For the\r\nportion of the continent to the northward of Mexico the data on\r\nwhich this map is based are much more abundant than for the southern\r\nportion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE FORESTS\r\n\r\nAs is indicated on the map just referred to, the forests of North\r\nAmerica in a general way form a broad belt, for the most part within the\r\ninfluence of winds from the ocean, which surrounds a large area of\r\ntreeless plains and plateaus in the west-central portion of the interior\r\ncontinental basin, but is broken and rendered irregular in its\r\nsouthwestern part of the treeless valley of the Great Basin region. The\r\nirregular circular belt of tree-covered land is closed at the south by\r\nthe forest on the lowlands of Mexico and Central America. This vast\r\nforest belt, extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from Panama\r\nto northern Canada, presents great variations even in its larger\r\nfeatures, and, for convenience, and also with the aim of expressing in a\r\nrough way natural relationships, needs to be subdivided for purpose of\r\nstudy. The basis for such a subdivision has already been suggested, as\r\nthe forests, like all other divisions of the life of the continent, are\r\nan expression of climatic conditions--that is, the boundaries of the\r\nbotanical and zoological provinces should agree with those of the\r\nclimatic provinces.\r\n\r\nOn this basis we have the tropical forest, which covers the more humid\r\nportions of the east and west margins as well as all of the southern\r\nportion of Mexico, together with nearly all of Central America and the\r\nWest Indies, and includes the southern extremity of Florida. Within the\r\ntropical forest, however, there are high mountains on which trees with\r\nthe general characteristic of those more northern floras find a\r\ncongenial habitat. The two austral and the transition provinces are to a\r\ngreat extent clothed with diversified forests, which are naturally\r\ndivided into two portions: an eastern division, embracing the Atlantic\r\nand Gulf border of the United States, together with the eastern part of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes region; and a western\r\ndivision, in which is included the lands bordering the Pacific\r\nfrom near Mount St. Elias southward to the vicinity of San Francisco,\r\nand also several irregular branches or detached island-like areas on the\r\nPacific mountains, in the United States and Mexico. The former of these\r\ndivisions may, in a general way, be termed the Atlantic, and the latter\r\nthe Pacific forest. Separating them is the treeless west-central portion\r\nof the Continental basin. Both the Atlantic and Pacific forests merge at\r\nthe north with the boreal forest, which extends diagonally across the\r\ncontinent from Newfoundland to Alaska. Peninsula-like and island-like\r\nareas occupied by the boreal forest occur in the sea-like expanse of the\r\ntransition and austral provinces, on both the Atlantic and Pacific\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThe tropical and boreal forests have their greatest extension from east\r\nto west or with the parallels of latitude, and are remarkable for their\r\nuniformity in general characteristics, the reason being that climatic\r\nconditions, and especially the temperature in summer, change less\r\nrapidly along east and west than along north and south lines. The\r\nAtlantic and Pacific forests, on the other hand, have their greatest\r\nextension across the parallels of latitude, and hence experience marked\r\nchanges from locality to locality in both temperature and precipitation,\r\nand are characterized by conspicuous changes from one locality to\r\nanother in the genera and species of trees of which they are composed.\r\nIn each of the areas occupied by the major divisions of the encircling\r\ncontinental forest belt there are marked variations in elevation, which\r\nare accompanied by corresponding climatic changes, and hence by\r\nmodifications in the forest growths. Of all portions of the continental\r\nforest belt, variation in elevation is least marked in the forests of\r\nCanada, and for this reason, in part, we there find the most uniform and\r\nmost monotonous of all the forests of the continent. The influence of\r\nelevation, however, on climate and on both plant and animal life is\r\ngreater for a given measure, as for 1,000 feet, in the torrid than in\r\nthe cool or cold zone, for the reason that the possible range in\r\nclimatic conditions is much greater at the south than at the north.\r\n\r\n_The Tropical Forest._--There are great areas in southern Mexico which\r\nare clothed with a typical tropical forest; while other similar forests\r\ncover nearly all of the lower portions of Central America, the larger or\r\nmore rugged West India islands, and the southern extremity of Florida.\r\nThroughout this vast region, within the influence of the trade-winds and\r\nof the equatorial rains, the forests are luxuriant and beautiful, except\r\non lowlands not adjacent to the windward side of mountains. The\r\ncharacteristic trees of the hot, humid lowlands extend up the mountain\r\nto an elevation of some 4,000 or 5,000 feet, where a change to the\r\naspects familiar in the lowlands of the temperate zone begins, and palms\r\ngive place to oaks and pines.\r\n\r\nOf the many features of the tropical forests which impress a traveller\r\nfrom colder regions, none excite greater wonder than the large number of\r\nvegetable species growing in close proximity. It has been said, and\r\napparently the statement cannot be successfully challenged, that a\r\ngreater variety of plants may be collected on 100 square yards of\r\nsurface in the humid, tropical lowlands than can be found on 100 square\r\nmiles in the forest of central Canada. It is probably safe to extend\r\nthis striking contrast by saying that of the trees on a typical area in\r\nthe tropical forest of the size mentioned, there are in many localities\r\nmore species than in the whole of the subarctic forest.\r\n\r\nAmong the characteristics of tropical forests is the presence of many\r\nkinds of plants on a limited area, hundreds of species struggling upward\r\nto the light where there seems room but for one; the variety of mosses\r\nand lichens; the profusion of flowering parasites; the luxuriance of the\r\nvines, many of which are armed with spines; and the abundance of the\r\nremarkable aerial roots termed _lianas_. Of the last there is a great\r\nvariety, some of them of large size and surprising length; they\r\nfrequently descend from plants entwined among the topmost branches of\r\ngreat trees, looking not unlike the cordage of a forest of masts in some\r\ncrowded port, and on reaching the ground send out rootlets in the humid\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nIn the depths of a tropical forest it is always twilight. Even at\r\nnoontide no shafts of yellow sunlight reach the ground to glorify mossy\r\nbanks and flower-gemmed dells, as in the open woods of temperate climes,\r\nbut a diffused greenish light, producing weird effects, alone penetrates\r\nthe dense leafy canopy far overhead. The roots of even the larger trees\r\nin these hot, humid forests do not have to descend deeply in order to\r\nfind the necessary moisture or to receive protection from frost and\r\nsudden changes of temperature, but are usually widely expanded and\r\nthickly interwoven over the surface. The earth from which the dense\r\nvegetation derives nourishment is surprisingly deficient in vegetable\r\nmould, which is a characteristic feature in the moist forests of\r\ntemperate and even subarctic regions, where the complete decay of dead\r\nvegetation is long delayed. In the tropical forests the annual supply of\r\ndead vegetable matter suitable to be transformed into humus is far\r\ngreater than on a corresponding area in the woods of more northern\r\nregions, but decay is so rapid, owing to the uniformly high temperature\r\nand the conditions favouring the multiplication of bacteria, that even\r\ngreat trees on falling quickly disappear; in many instances, the forms\r\nof prostrate tree trunks are preserved and overgrown with luxuriant\r\nmosses or gorgeously festooned with ferns and orchids, but soon become\r\nfragile shells from which nearly all the woody tissues have been removed\r\nby decay or by swarming colonies of insects. Where life is so exuberant\r\nand the wants of growing plants so great it seems as if the food supply\r\nwas insufficient, and that none could be spared to accumulate on the\r\nground and form a soil.\r\n\r\nThe two most characteristic and distinctive classes of plants in the\r\ntropical forests are the palms and the ferns, each of which is\r\nrepresented by many genera, a large number of species, and multitudes of\r\nindividuals, and in each class there is a gradation in size from low\r\nherbaceous growths to arboreal forms.\r\n\r\nIn every way worthy of first mention among the plants of the Caribbean\r\nforests are the palms. A characteristic portion of the forest referred\r\nto occurs in Cuba, where, as is stated by R. T. Hill in his recently\r\npublished and attractive book descriptive of the West Indies,\r\nthere are some 26 species of palms, which give variety and beauty to the\r\nscenery of the \"Pearl of the Antilles,\" as well as shade and food to its\r\ninhabitants. At the head of these for height and grace of form stands\r\nthe royal palm, which might well be chosen for the emblem of the fair\r\nisland it adorns. The wide-spreading crown of glossy pinnate leaves of\r\nthis species is borne on a spindle-shaped stem of tough fibrous wood--so\r\nstrong and pliant that it defies even the hurricane--in many instances\r\n150 feet above the ground. The tree is a marvel of beauty and\r\nelasticity, and, fortunately for Cuba, is one of the most abundant of\r\nthe larger trees on the island. It is met with almost everywhere; in the\r\ncentre of broad pasture-lands it often stands alone, tall and straight,\r\nwhile bordering the cultivated fields of the rich planter it forms a\r\nshady avenue to his dwelling. This well-named _royal palm_ has also been\r\ncalled the _blessed tree_, for every part of it has its usefulness to\r\nmankind. Certain medicinal qualities are claimed for its roots; the\r\nouter portion of its trunk is easily split into boards for use in making\r\nhouses and furniture for the poorer people; in the centre of the cluster\r\nof young leaves at the summit is a tender substance which is eaten raw,\r\nor cooked as a vegetable, or preserved with sugar as a table delicacy.\r\nThe broadened leaf-stalks where they leave the main stem form a\r\nsheath-like expansion resembling a thin board, often four to six feet\r\nlong, which is made to serve a variety of purposes, such as plates, and\r\nwhen soaked in water becomes pliable and may be fashioned into baskets\r\nand dishes for cooking, and at the same time furnishes salt for the\r\nseasoning of the boiling vegetables or meat.\r\n\r\nThe world-encircling cocoanut-palm is found about the shore of tropical\r\nNorth America, and there, as elsewhere, serves a great variety of uses,\r\nbeing a greater blessing, especially to the natives and the poorer\r\ndescendants of European and African immigrants, than even the royal\r\npalm. The economic importance of its wood-fibres, leaves, and fruit are\r\ntoo well known to require re-enumeration.\r\n\r\nWhile the wealth of palms is confined to the hot, moist regions\r\nof Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies, several members of the\r\nsame great family are found in the United States. The royal palm is\r\nnative to southern Florida, while the low fan-palms cover much of the\r\nnorthern portion of the same State, and occur even about the Ozark Hills\r\nin Arkansas, and the palmetto, growing to be a stately tree, is found\r\nnear the coast in the Carolinas and is the emblem of South Carolina, the\r\n\"Palmetto State.\"\r\n\r\nThe ferns, although abundant, especially in moist woods from Alaska\r\nsouthward, throughout the continent, reach their greatest variety and\r\nrichest luxuriance in the West Indies and Central America, where the\r\ngraceful and most artistically beautiful tree-ferns add an indescribable\r\ncharm to the always varied foliage. The tree-ferns grow farther up the\r\nmountains of the torrid zone than do the larger palms (in the same\r\nmanner that the smaller ferns extend much farther north than the most\r\nhardy palmettoes), and form a conspicuous feature in the foreground of\r\nnearly every wide-reaching prospect in the more elevated portions of the\r\nWest Indies, Central America, and south-central Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the palms and ferns, the tropical forests of North\r\nAmerica contain a large number of trees of great economic importance.\r\nChief among these are the mahogany, which is native to the lands\r\nbordering the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, and reaches the largest\r\nsize and produces the most beautiful and most highly prized wood on\r\nCuba, Haiti, the Bahamas, and Jamaica. As is well known, this hard,\r\ndark, heavy, fine-grained, and exceedingly durable wood has been used\r\nfor the best grades of cabinet-work for about two centuries, and is\r\nstill unsurpassed for the beauty of its grain, susceptibility of a high\r\npolish, and the several ways in which it is adapted for the carver's\r\ntool. On account of the great and long-continued demand for its wood it\r\nhas become scarce in all but the most inaccessible localities. When\r\nallowed to reach full maturity it is a large, wide-spreading tree with\r\nnumerous branches, looking not unlike a giant oak, but has pinnate\r\nleaves and small, although somewhat conspicuous, white flowers.\r\n\r\nAnother gift of the tropical forest is the lignum-vitae, which furnishes\r\nthe exceedingly tough, hard, resinous wood preferred above all others\r\nfor the making of pulleys, mallets, etc. Many other highly prized woods,\r\nnot known, however, by familiar names, are also found in the varied\r\nforests of tropical America, as well as numerous vegetable dyes, such as\r\nlogwood, brazil-wood, indigo, etc.\r\n\r\nThe lands of the Caribbean-Gulf region are credited with having\r\nintroduced to civilized man the potato, Indian corn (maize), and\r\ntobacco, although the home of the former is probably in the Andean\r\nportion of South America. Indian corn grows luxuriantly not only in the\r\nhot lowlands of Mexico, but on the border of the central table-land of\r\nthat republic, where it is supposed to be indigenous, and has now become\r\none of the leading crops of temperate North America, and is cultivated\r\nin many other portions of the world. Tobacco was found under cultivation\r\nin Mexico at the time of the first coming of Europeans, and retains for\r\nits familiar name the appellation of the district where it was first\r\nseen. From Mexico also come the dahlia and the giant sunflower, as well\r\nas the various species of aloes and cacti now so common in gardens and\r\nconservatories the world over.\r\n\r\nOf all the plants, excepting Indian corn and the potato, which are\r\nnative to the region under review, none has proved such an unalloyed\r\nblessing to civilized man as the cacao-tree. As this tree is unfamiliar\r\nto most residents of temperate lands, it may not be unprofitable to\r\ntranscribe in part a description of it from Rhind's Vegetable Kingdom.\r\nThe tree is very handsome, from 12 to 16 feet high, with an upright\r\ntrunk some 5 feet high; the leaves are lanceolate, with entire margins,\r\nand of a bright-green colour; the flowers are inconspicuous, reddish,\r\nwith yellowish sepals; the fruit, attached by short stems to both trunk\r\nand branches, has a yellowish and reddish colour, oblong, about 3 inches\r\nin length, and consists of a fleshy rind, half an inch thick, containing\r\na white pulp in which are imbedded about 25 seeds. The seeds, when\r\nroasted, freed from their husks, and ground, furnish the chocolate so\r\nextensively used, especially in France and Spain and in the\r\nformer Spanish colonies, and is increasing in favour among\r\nEnglish-speaking people.\r\n\r\nVanilla, which is used in flavouring chocolate as well as many other\r\ndishes, was also found in use among the Aztecs at the time of the\r\nSpanish conquest. The vanilla-plant is a climbing vine, with lanceolate\r\nleaves 18 inches or more in length, and produces a pod containing\r\nbean-like seeds. The pods and seeds when properly dried furnish the\r\nflavouring extract of commerce.\r\n\r\nAlthough the trees which yield rubber in America, as well as the\r\ncinchona, from the bark of which quinine is obtained, are justly to be\r\naccredited to South America, yet certain varieties of these useful\r\nplants occur in Central America and are under cultivation as far\r\nnorthward as central Mexico.\r\n\r\nA more detailed account of the plants of great utility in one direction\r\nor another native to the tropical forests, should include plantains,\r\nbananas, and yams, the wide distribution of which, largely by human\r\nagency, throughout the torrid zone is well known. The delicious\r\npineapple is native to the Caribbean region, and was found in the\r\nmarkets of the Aztecs by the early Spanish invaders, although perhaps\r\nindigenous to other lands as well. In Mexico especially, but on the\r\nborders of the tropical forest and in the drier interior, grows the\r\nagave, from which the national beverage, _pulque_, is obtained, and\r\nanother species of the same peculiarly American family of plants\r\nsupplies great quantities of the tough fibre known as sisal or henequen\r\nhemp, particularly on the stony, arid portions of the peninsula of\r\nYucatan. Of interest to children especially is the fact that Mexico\r\nexports some 3,000,000 pounds of chewing-gum each year, which is\r\nobtained from a plant there growing wild. To this list of indigenous\r\nproducts may be added ginger, arrowroot, etc., as well as many fruits\r\nscarcely known outside the tropics, such as the mango, alligator-pear,\r\nbreadfruit, and numerous others. This hasty enumeration might be greatly\r\nextended or presented in more detail, but probably enough has been said\r\nto indicate the great and probably as yet but partially\r\ndetermined economic importance of the vegetable products of the torrid\r\nportion of North America.\r\n\r\nAssociated with the tropical forest, but thriving best in an advanced\r\nskirmish-line about its drier inland borders, is a group of plants\r\nindigenous to the two Americas--the strangely shaped and spinous cacti.\r\nOne of these, the prickly-pear, as it is termed on account of its\r\npear-like edible fruit, is the emblem of Mexico. A fit legend to place\r\nabout this unique heraldic design would be the motto inscribed on the\r\nrattlesnake flag of colonial days in America, \"Don't tread on me,\" as\r\nevery one will appreciate who has travelled in the southwestern portion\r\nof the United States or in the upland regions of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe cacti extend from South America northward through the lands\r\nbordering the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, and east of the\r\nMississippi are represented by a single genus, _Opuntia_--the\r\nprickly-pear, or Indian fig, as it is often termed--which grows in dry\r\nsituations as far north as Massachusetts and Michigan. In the Great\r\nBasin several genera of cacti are plentiful, especially on dry, stony\r\nuplands, and two species reach as far northward as the Canadian\r\nboundary. Although the cacti tribe is widely distributed, the region\r\nwhere it presents the greatest variety and the largest individuals is in\r\nthe dry, semi-desert portions of Arizona and the table-lands of central\r\nMexico. It is most at home on sterile, rocky ridges and amid bare cliffs\r\nwhere there appears to be but little soil, but the strong roots strike\r\ndeep into the earth in search of moisture. The cacti present great\r\ndiversity of form and an indefinite differentiation of stem and leaf. In\r\nfact, there are no easily recognised leaves in the ordinary sense of the\r\nterm, but the fluted and jointed stems perform the function of foliage.\r\nThe plants are economical of moisture, and not only present a minimum of\r\nsurface for evaporation or transpiration, but their epidermal tissues\r\nare for the most part without pores, thus retarding the escape of the\r\nmoisture drawn from the seemingly dry soil.\r\n\r\nIn size and shape the cacti present great variety, ranging\r\nthrough all gradations from the thick, strongly jointed, pad-like\r\nexpansions of the prickly-pear, a few inches high, growing in widely\r\nextended clusters and massive globular forms, looking not unlike spiny\r\nmelons, 2 or 3 feet or more in diameter, to jointed and fluted columns,\r\nbristling with sharp spines, the largest of which, known as the\r\ncandelabrum cactus, attains a height of from 40 to 60 feet. In this the\r\nlargest of all the cacti, which is not uncommon in Arizona and adjacent\r\nportions of Mexico, the central upright stem, frequently 20 inches or\r\nmore in diameter, sends out from 1 to perhaps 7 or 8 club-shaped\r\nbranches, which leave the parent stem nearly at right angles, but soon\r\nbend upward and become parallel with the central stalk, which they\r\nfrequently surpass in height, their form thus suggesting a branching\r\ncandlestick or candelabrum.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the bizarre and frequently repellent appearance of the cacti\r\nas seen under cultivation, in their barren homes they are in harmony\r\nwith their surroundings, and add a characteristic, and even beautiful\r\nelement to the scenery of the parched and generally desolate valleys and\r\nrocky slopes where they thrive best. Their blossoms are large, usually\r\neither white or brilliantly coloured, and expand in the hot, dry air,\r\nfully exposed to the intense sunlight, and present a freshness and\r\nvigour which tell of the abundant store of moisture within the thick\r\nrind inclosing their stems. The showy flowers are borne close to the\r\nbody of the plant or at the ends or edges of the inflated pad-like\r\nleaves, and are scentless, except in the case of a few night-blooming\r\nspecies, and attract insects from afar by reason of the conspicuousness\r\nof their widely expanded corollas. The fruits also are usually\r\nconspicuous, and present many rich tints of red and yellow, which at a\r\nlittle distance give them the appearance of flowers. The fruit of\r\nseveral species are edible, and even delicious, especially when gathered\r\nfresh from the thorny stems and eaten on the desert, perhaps many miles\r\nfrom the nearest spring or stream. One species of cactus growing\r\nabundantly in Mexico and known as the cochineal-fig, is inhabited by the\r\ncochineal-insect, from which the highly prized dye of that name is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nA companion of the cacti in the arid region where they flourish best is\r\nthe yucca, or Spanish bayonet, which sometimes attains the size of small\r\ntrees and throws out several branches. Its leaves are stiff,\r\nthick-stemmed, and each one terminated by a sharp spine, as is well\r\nknown from the many examples to be seen under cultivation in Europe and\r\nAmerica. The flowers are white and borne in luxuriant showy spikes a\r\nfoot or two in length, and sometimes give to dry, rocky slopes the\r\nappearance of a luxuriant garden.\r\n\r\nThe cacti, yuccas, and associated plants of the most arid portions of\r\nthe continent stand far apart, without mutual support or shelter, and\r\nfind protection in their spines, thick rinds, and frequently acrid\r\njuices. Their colours are usually neutral, grayish green, rendered still\r\nmore inconspicuous by the dust that settles on them, but their flowers\r\nare as a rule conspicuous, thus serving to attract pollen-bearing\r\ninsects, and their fruits are in many instances brightly coloured, and\r\nfurnish food for birds and other animals, which assist in the\r\ndistribution of their seeds.\r\n\r\n_The Atlantic Forest._--The originally forest-covered eastern portion of\r\nNorth America, referred to under the term Atlantic forest, embraces the\r\nregion from the eastern coast of the continent inland across the\r\nAppalachian Mountains and interior Continental basin to the eastern\r\nborder of the prairies or plains; its southern limit, in a general way,\r\nis the coast-line of the Gulf of Mexico, but the arbitrary boundary,\r\ndividing it from the tropical forest, crosses the southern portion of\r\nFlorida, and at the extreme southwest is drawn at the Rio Grande. The\r\nnorthern boundary of the Atlantic forest is also an arbitrary line, and\r\nfollows the fiftieth parallel of latitude from the mouth of the St.\r\nLawrence westward to the region about the Lake of the Woods; along this\r\nboundary the varied Atlantic forest merges with the monotonous and\r\nmostly coniferous subarctic forest. The region thus roughly outlined\r\ncomprises over 2,000,000 square miles, and was at the time of the first\r\ncoming of white men to America almost completely forest-covered, but the\r\nnatural conditions are now profoundly modified, and to a great extent\r\nthe trees have been cut or burned, and the land they shaded\r\nconverted into cultivated fields.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic forest as a whole has two leading characteristics, the\r\nfirst being the great variety and frequently large size of the deciduous\r\ntrees--that is, of broad-leaved trees, such as the oak, hickory, elm,\r\nmaple, chestnut, etc., which drop their ripe leaves each fall and renew\r\nthem the following spring--and the second, the intermingling of the\r\ntrees of the class just mentioned with the coniferous trees, such as the\r\npine, spruce, tamarack, etc., which have narrow, needle-shaped leaves\r\nand are usually designated as evergreens. While these general statements\r\nare sufficiently accurate for our present purpose, it is to be\r\nremembered that some of the broad-leaved trees (_Angiosperms_) are\r\nevergreen, especially in the southern portion of the Atlantic forest,\r\nas, for example, some of the oaks, the magnolias, the holly, etc.; while\r\nat the north, certain of the conifers (_Gymnosperms_) shed their leaves\r\neach fall, as is conspicuously illustrated by the yellow of the tamarack\r\nor larch forests of the northeastern portion of the United States and\r\neastern Canada, in November, and the bright green of the same trees in\r\nMay of each year. It is in the intermediate temperate region, between\r\nthe mostly evergreen coniferous subarctic forests and the mostly\r\nevergreen broad-leaved trees of the Caribbean forest, that the wonderful\r\ntransformation in the colours of the mountains and plains each autumn\r\nbecomes the most conspicuous feature in the annual round of seasonal\r\nchanges as expressed by the vegetation.\r\n\r\nOf the two classes of forest-trees, represented by the oak and the pine,\r\nwhich are intermingled and struggle with each other for supremacy in the\r\nAtlantic forest, it is difficult to say which is the more beautiful or\r\nwhich is of the greater service to man. The broad-leaved trees give us\r\nour hardwoods, used extensively for furniture, the interior finish of\r\nbuildings, and for the manufacture of tools, farming implements, wagons,\r\ncarriages, sleighs, etc. To a great extent it was the availability of\r\nthese strong, tough, hard, and durable woods which has made American\r\ntools and implements of such a high grade of excellence that they\r\nare in demand in every civilized country. For example, the American\r\nax-helve, made of hickory, is almost a work of art, as well as of\r\nutility, and it is prized above all others by foresters the world over.\r\nThe same tree has aided no less efficiently in the popularity and\r\nexcellence of American carriages and sleighs, the equal of which for\r\nlightness, strength, and durability has not been reached in other\r\ncountries. The pines and their near relatives furnish what unfortunately\r\nhas been considered an unlimited supply of easily workable lumber,\r\nsuitable for building houses, vessels, bridges, and many other purposes.\r\nOf the pine lumber supplied by the Atlantic forest, there are two\r\nprincipal varieties, the far-famed white pine, furnished by New England,\r\nthe Great Lake region, and southeastern Canada, and the yellow pine,\r\nwhich comes from the South Atlantic and Gulf States.\r\n\r\nOf the Angiosperms which reach the dignity of trees, the Atlantic forest\r\npossesses a variety and abundance not exceeded elsewhere in the world.\r\nThe most characteristic examples are the maples, elms, oaks, hickories,\r\nwalnuts, chestnuts, ashes, basswoods, birches, tulip-trees, magnolias,\r\nliquidambar, tupelos, sycamores, etc., nearly all of which are\r\nrepresented by a number of species or varieties and vast numbers of\r\nindividuals. While this diversity is found throughout the forests of the\r\neast-central part of the continent, certain regions are characterized by\r\nthe abundance and large size of the trees belonging to one or to a few\r\ngenera, so that a striking change is met with as one travels in any\r\ndirection. The maples and elms reach their greatest size and abundance\r\nat the north, especially in New England, and thence westward to the\r\nMississippi Valley, where they are the favourite shade-trees of villages\r\nand farms. In regions where the forests have been removed choice\r\nspecimens of these trees have frequently been saved or subsequently\r\nplanted, and standing alone, without competition and fully exposed to\r\nthe light, reach great perfection of form and a high degree of beauty.\r\nThe oaks are represented by a large number of species and varieties\r\nthroughout the entire Atlantic forest, but reach their largest size and\r\ngreatest abundance, both of species and individuals, in central\r\nand southern portions of the eastern United States. The same may be said\r\nalso of the hickories, except that the maximum in reference to size,\r\nnumber of species, and abundance is attained in the region of the Ozark\r\nHills. The tulip-tree, so named from the profusion of showy yellow\r\nblossoms it bears, is large and wide-spreading, with broad, dark-green\r\nleaves, and has the centre of its habitat in Kentucky, where many\r\nmagnificent examples occur along the fences separating the broad meadows\r\nand rich pastures of the region of the blue grass, but thrives also from\r\nthe Atlantic coast westward to beyond the Mississippi, and from Ontario\r\non the north nearly to the Gulf of Mexico on the south. Not only is the\r\ntulip-tree an ornament and a blessing on account of its flower-laden\r\nbranches and dense shade, but its white, even-grained wood is of great\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nTo give even a list of the deciduous trees which flourish and reach a\r\nhigh degree of perfection in the Atlantic forest would require far more\r\nspace than is at present available. There is one other genus, however,\r\nwhich cannot be passed by even by a casual observer, and that is the\r\nmagnolia, one species of which, the _grandiflora_, is the most\r\nmagnificent of all the splendid broad-leaved trees of America. This, the\r\nlargest and finest of the several species of its genus found in the\r\neastern portion of the United States, attains a great size in the\r\nsouthern Appalachian region, but is best developed in the lower portion\r\nof the Mississippi Valley. It is frequently from 50 to 80 feet or more\r\nin height, wide-spreading, and in many instances upward of 3 feet in\r\ndiameter, with dark-green leaves which do not fall in the autumn. In\r\nspring the dark foliage is beautified by cup-shaped blossoms of creamy\r\nwhiteness and remarkable fragrance, which measure 3 or 4 inches in\r\ndiameter. When the magnolia is in blossom it becomes a centre of\r\ndelicious perfume and a colony of insect life. Its wood, although creamy\r\nwhite and excellent for cabinet-work and interior finish of houses, has\r\nnot as yet found favour for these or other purposes.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few species of broad-leaved forest-trees\r\nfound in greatest perfection in the northern portion of the Atlantic\r\nforest, they reach their greatest development in size, number of\r\nspecies, and density of growth in the southern portion of the broad\r\nMississippi basin, where, in addition to magnolias, the tulip-tree,\r\netc., chestnuts, hickories, oaks, and many other genera grow side by\r\nside and attain great height and dignity. This is also the centre of\r\ndispersion of the American hawthorns, which reach a size and beauty\r\nunrivalled elsewhere. The Osage orange is peculiar to this region, and\r\nthe red cedar (juniper), the most widely distributed of all the American\r\nconifers, and also the yellow or southern pine are there at their best.\r\nMuch of this region still retains its primitive wildness.\r\n\r\nThe great extent of the Atlantic forest in latitude, the topographic\r\ndiversity of the region it occupies, and its exposure on the east to\r\nmaritime and on the west to continental climatic conditions, have led to\r\ngreat variations within itself. From the coast of New England westward\r\nand including the entire drainage basin of the St. Lawrence, together\r\nwith an extension southward along the Appalachians, the forests are\r\ncomposed largely and over extensive areas almost wholly of coniferous\r\ntrees. This region of northern evergreens contains in its southern\r\nportion sturdy growths of broad-leaved deciduous trees. The spruces, the\r\nmost characteristic of the trees of the subarctic region, are present\r\nin abundance on the mountains of New England, and still form a dark\r\nmantle over the Adirondack hills; but on the less elevated lands\r\nadjacent the white pine dominated and outnumbered all its rivals in the\r\nprimeval forest.\r\n\r\nThe white or Weymouth pine, which up to the present time has proved to\r\nbe of greater commercial value than any other tree on the continent,\r\nextends westward from southern Newfoundland and the coasts of the\r\nmaritime provinces of Canada to Minnesota, and occupies nearly the\r\nentire drainage area of the St. Lawrence, together with an extension\r\nsouthward along the Appalachians nearly to their southern limit.\r\n\r\nThe white pine is a large tree for the region in which it grows. Its\r\nheight is from 70 to 150 feet, with a diameter at the base of from 3 to\r\n9 feet. It thrives best on sandy soil and hills of glacial drift, and\r\nendures a severe winter climate, as well as the frequently\r\nlong-continued droughts of the hot summers. Its wood is soft, compact,\r\nwith an even, straight grain, and is not conspicuously resinous. The\r\nsap-wood is nearly white and the heart of a light brown, slightly tinged\r\nwith red; it is easily worked and susceptible of a good polish; it is\r\nmore extensively used for boards, shingles, etc., than any other wood in\r\nthe eastern portion of the continent, and is in demand also for\r\ncabinet-work, the interior finish of buildings, ship-building, and many\r\nother purposes.\r\n\r\nThe southern pine--known also as the \"long-leaved pine\"; \"Georgia pine,\"\r\nfor the reason that the lumber derived from it was first extensively\r\nshipped from that State; \"yellow pine,\" in reference to the golden\r\ncolour of its wood; and \"hard pine,\" in distinction from the softer\r\nwhite pine--is another valuable species. The tree with these several\r\nsynonyms, of which the term _southern pine_ will here be used, forms\r\nopen forests with but scanty undergrowth, over a region extending from\r\nnear the Atlantic coast in the Carolinas and Florida, westward to the\r\ndelta region of the Mississippi, and reappears again to the southward of\r\nthe Ozark Hills. Although not so large, and to many admirers of\r\nbeautiful trees not so picturesque or pleasing as its relative in the\r\nmore rigorous climate of the St. Lawrence basin, the southern pine,\r\ngrowing within the reach of the moist, warm winds from the Atlantic and\r\nGulf of Mexico, is still an attractive tree, especially when young and\r\nwhen freedom is afforded to expand its boughs. It is seldom over 100\r\nfeet high, and as cut for lumber has on an average a diameter of about 2\r\nfeet at the base, although individuals measuring 3 or 4 feet in diameter\r\nare not rare in certain favoured areas. It grows best on dry, sandy\r\nsoil, outside the flood-plains of streams, where it forms monotonous\r\nforests, with but few intergrowths of other trees. The wood is heavy,\r\nhard, strong, durable, coarse-grained, very resinous, and of many\r\nshades of brown and yellow. When sawed into lumber, it serves a wide\r\nrange of uses, more especially for the frames of buildings and ships,\r\nand for the floors and interior finish of houses.\r\n\r\nNext to the southern pine, the most characteristic tree of the Atlantic\r\ncoastal plain southward from Virginia and westward through the Gulf\r\nStates, is the cypress, also a conifer, but, like the tamarack, sheds\r\nits leaves in the autumn. The cypress grows especially in swampy\r\nlocalities, and has a widely expanded base, suitable for support on\r\nmarshy soil, and reaches a large girth, although seldom over 75 feet\r\nhigh. Aged and most picturesque examples are growing in isolated\r\npositions in Lake Drummond, the central water body of the Dismal Swamp,\r\nand in many other similar situations in the belt of low country fringing\r\nthe borders of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Its wood is used for\r\nmost of the purposes for which the southern pine is employed, and now\r\nthat the white pine is approaching extinction, is to a considerable\r\nextent supplying the demand for cabinet-wood.\r\n\r\nIn glancing at the larger and most numerous trees of the Atlantic\r\nforest, and those of greatest utility, we should not neglect the humbler\r\nplants, usually of little, if any, purely commercial value, but\r\npriceless on account of their beauty and the fragrance of their flowers,\r\nwhich grow beneath the shade of their larger and more stately associates\r\nor are content to possess the local areas, perhaps high on the\r\nmountains, where the conditions of climate or soil are unfavourable for\r\nthe growth of large trees. Throughout the eastern portion of the United\r\nStates, but more especially on the slopes and summit portions of the\r\nAppalachians, there are many species of azalea, laurel, rhododendron,\r\netc., which grow luxuriantly and in spring and early summer furnish a\r\nwealth of bloom that is scarcely rivalled elsewhere on the continent. In\r\nthis same region also, but extending westward to Michigan and Minnesota,\r\nand even to eastern Nebraska, grows the redbud or Judas-tree, which each\r\nMay becomes as thickly set throughout all its branches with small\r\ncrimson blossoms as are the tree-like coral in tropical seas with\r\nexpanded polyps. This beautiful tree of low growth many times gives to\r\nthe mountains of Virginia, when seen from a distance, a delicate blush\r\nlike that which the osiers earlier in the spring impart to the marshy\r\nvales and river-banks. A companion of the redbud, but far more widely\r\ndistributed, is the dogwood or cornel, of several species, the most\r\nconspicuous of which, and in the Appalachian region the most common, is\r\nthe flowering dogwood. In May and June this species puts out a profusion\r\nof clusters of small greenish flowers, each of which is surrounded by a\r\nbroadly expanded and very showy corolla-like involucre, composed of four\r\nwhite or pinkish inversely heart-shaped leaves. When the cornel is at\r\nthe height of its spring-time glory it stands forth amid the tender\r\ngreens, russets, and pinks of the unfolding leaves of the various trees\r\nand shrubs among which it grows as if the orchards and forests had been\r\ncommingled by some fairy gardener. In autumn the cornel again becomes\r\nconspicuous in the woodlands by reason of its clusters of coral-red\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nIn the splendid Atlantic forests, with their marvellous intermingling of\r\nshining pine-needles, broad, swaying leaves, and many-coloured trunks,\r\nthere are also vines and creepers sometimes forming impenetrable\r\ntangles, as where the broad leaves of the wild grape grow in pendent\r\nsheets of green from supporting trees, or the jessamine fills the air\r\nwith fragrance. Of the many vines which entwine the trunks of trees,\r\nmantle the rocks, and quickly claim abandoned fields, especially in\r\nVirginia and neighbouring States to the southward, none is more\r\nbeautiful or more highly prized for the charm it adds alike to fields,\r\nfences, and forests than the familiar Virginia creeper. The glory of\r\nthis widely distributed vine comes in the autumn when its leaves change\r\nfrom green to the most brilliant scarlet. During the season of harvest\r\nalso, when the trees are arrayed in their greatest splendour, the ground\r\nis yellow with golden-rods or purple with asters. This annual carnival\r\nof colour embraces the entire Atlantic forest, but is most\r\nresplendent in the region of the Hudson and St. Lawrence. A charming\r\nlittle denizen of the Atlantic forest is the lowly and humble arbutus,\r\nor Mayflower, which springs up through the dead leaves carpeting the\r\nground in early spring, and fills the air with its delicious perfume.\r\nThe Mayflower is a trailing plant, but a few inches high, with rounded\r\nor oval leaves, which remain green all winter and furnish a pleasing\r\nsetting for the small pink or rose-coloured blossoms, which appear in\r\nearly spring even before the snow has melted. It reaches great\r\nperfection beneath the pines of New England and about the Laurentian\r\nlakes, but extends far southward along the Appalachians, where elevation\r\ngives conditions similar to those of the lower region at the north.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic forest reaches its western limit in the Mississippi basin\r\n(Fig. 28), and is succeeded westward by treeless prairies, which merge\r\nalong their western margins with the drier and less completely\r\ngrass-covered high plains adjacent to the east base of the Rocky\r\nMountains. The forest does not terminate abruptly, as on the border of a\r\ncleared field, but by gradual transitions. As its western limit is\r\napproached, a change in the species is noted, trees which thrive on\r\nuplands and can sustain long-continued summer drought replacing the\r\nspecies best adapted for more humid conditions. The forest is most\r\nextended, however, along the streams where white-trunked cottonwoods,\r\nfrequently of great size, with widely spreading branches, extend even\r\ninto the region of the great plateaus. Much of the prairie region in\r\nIllinois, Iowa, etc., was originally nearly surrounded by forest\r\ngrowths. The natural condition of the prairies and higher plains\r\nadjacent to them on the west and the reason for the limits set to the\r\nwestern extension of the Atlantic forest will be considered later under\r\nthe heading _Prairies and Plateaus_.\r\n\r\n_The Boreal Forest._--From Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Labrador a\r\nforest composed mainly of a few species of coniferous trees extends\r\nwestward, and after passing the southern extremity of Hudson Bay, is\r\nprolonged northwestward across the continent and in the region of\r\nthe mouth of the Mackenzie nearly to the shore of the Arctic Ocean. It\r\nextends also through central Alaska to within about 100 miles of the\r\nborder of Bering Sea. This vast transverse forest belt which unites the\r\nnorthern extremity of the Atlantic forest with the northern portion of\r\nthe Pacific forest is over 3,000 miles long from southeast to northwest,\r\nand on an average fully 600 miles wide. On the north, more especially in\r\narctic Canada and as it approaches the shore of Bering Sea, it thins\r\nout, owing to the severity of the winter climate, the trees become\r\ndwarfed and stunted in much the same way as the trees adjacent to the\r\ntimber-line on high mountains, and is succeeded by the broad treeless\r\nplains of the Barren Grounds and tundra. Along its south-central border\r\nits extension is again limited by climatic conditions, principally the\r\ndryness of the hot summers. The trees are there scattered or form\r\nisolated groves to the south of the general forest boundary, and are\r\nfinally succeeded by the treeless prairies and interior plains and\r\nplateaus. On the east the great northern forest merges with the pine of\r\nthe northern portion of the Atlantic forest, and in a similar way at the\r\nnorthwest passes by insensible gradations into the north extension of\r\nthe coniferous forest growing on the Pacific mountains. In each of the\r\ninstances there is no well-defined boundary between the east and west\r\nbelt of northern forests and the north and south forest belts adjacent\r\nto the Atlantic and Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe boreal forest presents a striking contrast to the forests of the\r\ntorrid zone and to the greater portion of the forests of temperate\r\nregions in the fact that it is composed of but a few species of trees.\r\nMonotony which becomes oppressive to one who lingers long in its sombre\r\nshade is its most conspicuous characteristic. In the main it is composed\r\nof but eight species of trees, namely, white and black spruce, larch or\r\ntamarack, canoe-birch, balsam-poplar, aspen, balsam-fir, and the gray\r\npine. Of these the spruces are the most abundant and most characteristic\r\nas well as the most northern trees of the continent. They\r\nfrequently reach sufficient size to make them available for building log\r\nhouses and for lumber.\r\n\r\nFour of the species mentioned above, namely, the white spruce,\r\ncanoe-birch, balsam-poplar, and aspen, cross the entire breadth of the\r\ncontinent from Labrador to Alaska, but the pines and firs in the east\r\nand the west are of different species. The larch or tamarack, which\r\nforms such an important feature of the forest in eastern Canada and\r\nabout the Laurentian lakes, extends westward to beyond Hudson Bay, but\r\nis represented by other species in the Mackenzie and Yukon basins, and\r\nin the northern portion of the Pacific mountains. The region occupied by\r\nthe great northern forest is interspersed with lakes, some of them of\r\nlarge size, and by innumerable swamps. The spruces and the gray pine\r\ngrow on the uplands between the lakes and swamps, while the cold, wet\r\nbottom-lands are occupied by poplars, dwarf birches, willows, and\r\nalders. In the north, near where the forest breaks into outstanding\r\ngroves and finally gives place to grassy hills, as along the Porcupine\r\nRiver in Alaska, the foliage in the lowlands becomes golden in autumn\r\nand forms irregular, far-reaching avenues of brilliant colour separating\r\nthe hills, which are black with spruce-trees or shimmer with the soft\r\ngray tints of ripened grasses. There is much that is beautiful and even\r\nlovely along the poleward border of the great forest, but within its\r\ndeeper recesses the ground is covered with mosses and lichens, and the\r\nstiff, sombre trees have a monotonous similarity and unbending rigidity.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the great area covered by the boreal forest, it being one of\r\nthe greatest, if not the most widely extended continuous growth of\r\narboreal vegetation in the world, it is of comparatively small economic\r\nimportance. Even if the trees were within the reach of a market, their\r\nwood is of inferior quality and not generally suitable for lumber. A\r\nmodern industry has been developed, however, which may bring it into\r\ndemand, namely, the manufacture of wood-pulp, so largely employed in the\r\nmaking of paper and for other purposes.\r\n\r\n_The Pacific Forest._--In the northern portion of the Rocky Mountain\r\nregion in Canada and Alaska the boreal forest, as already stated, merges\r\nby insensible gradations with the forests occupying the Pacific\r\nmountains from Alaska southward to Mexico. The junction line between the\r\ntwo is irregular, and what are essentially outliers of the more northern\r\nforest occupy the higher portions of the mountains in the western\r\nportion of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific forest begins at the north near Mount St. Elias, and at\r\nfirst occurs on isolated areas separated by ice-fields and inland\r\nreaches of the ocean, but in southeastern Alaska and on the numerous\r\nislands adjacent becomes more continuous and extends eastward far into\r\nBritish Columbia. As the timber-line in that region has an elevation of\r\nbut 2,500 feet at the extreme western extension of the forest, although\r\ngradually rising southward, large portions of the mountains are treeless\r\nand barren. In the United States, on account of increasing dryness of\r\nthe valleys from north to south, the forest becomes broken into many\r\ndetached portions, which occupy the mountains and higher plateaus and in\r\ngeneral are restricted to higher and higher locations with decrease in\r\nlatitude. This distribution illustrates in a striking manner the\r\ndependence of trees on humidity. The forest is densest and the trees in\r\ngeneral of greatest size and occur at the lowest elevations on the\r\nnorthwest portion of the Pacific coastal region, where the rainfall is\r\nexcessive and distributed practically throughout the entire year. The\r\nCoast Ranges from Alaska southward to central California, as well as the\r\nCascade Mountains and Sierra Nevada, are tree-clothed. In the interior,\r\nand especially in the central and southern portion of the Pacific\r\ncordillera, where the valleys are hot and dry in summer, trees are\r\nabsent, and even the borders of the rivers in many instances without\r\nshade. In Canada the trees frequently extend across the lowlands, but in\r\nMontana and Idaho the valleys resemble the treeless plains to the east\r\nof the Rocky Mountains, while the uplands and the lower mountain slopes\r\nare dark with firs and pines. Above the forest rise the barren and\r\nfrequently perpetually snow-covered summit-peaks and ridges. In\r\nthe Great Basin region, and from there southward, many of the mountains\r\nare practically destitute of trees from base to summit.\r\n\r\nSo vast is the region occupied by the Pacific forest and so varied the\r\nconditions dependent upon climate, soil, and elevation which influence\r\nits growth, that great variations in the genera and species of trees\r\ncomposing it are to be expected. This prediction is soon verified when\r\none travels through the forest. The extremes may be indicated briefly by\r\nreferring to the fact that at the north the trees are mainly spruces,\r\nfirs, and cedars, and at the south include the giant cactus, arboreal\r\nyucca, and the fan-leafed palm. In its medial division are the great\r\nforests of western Washington and Oregon, composed mainly of firs and\r\ncedars, and the no less magnificent forests of redwood-trees on the\r\nCoast Ranges of northern California and the west slope of the Sierra\r\nNevada. Like the boreal forest, the one under consideration is largely\r\ncomposed of coniferous trees, although in the valley, and especially\r\nalong the borders of streams in southern Canada, Washington, etc., a few\r\nspecies of broad-leaved trees, such as the maple, cottonwood, ash, and\r\nalder, thrive in close association with dark conifers; while in similar\r\nsituations farther south oaks growing in scattered groves give a\r\npark-like character to the land, as in the southern portion of\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the Atlantic region, the western portion of the\r\ncontinental forest belt is singularly lacking in broad-leaved trees, and\r\nsuch as are found are usually of small size and but little economic\r\nimportance. This lack, however, is perhaps more than counterbalanced by\r\nthe number both of individuals and of species and the great size and\r\nmagnificence of the conifers.\r\n\r\nOne of the densest and in many ways most thoroughly representative\r\nportions of the Pacific forest where it occupies an excessively humid\r\nregion occurs on the west side of the Cascade Mountains in Washington,\r\ninclusive of the Puget Sound basin and the region to the westward from\r\nwhich rise the Olympic Mountains.\r\n\r\nIn western Washington the forest is composed mainly, and, in\r\nfact, over large areas, almost entirely of two species of trees, namely,\r\nthe red fir and the red cedar, each of which attains gigantic\r\ndimensions. Of these two species, the first is the more common, the\r\nlarger, and by far the more important from a commercial point of view.\r\nIt frequently, and, in fact, commonly, attains a height of from 200 to\r\n300 feet, with a diameter at the base of from 8 to 10 or more feet. Not\r\nonly do these magnificent trees reach such great dimensions, but they\r\nare thickly set over hundreds of square miles of territory. In thousands\r\nof instances the great trunks sheathed in rough thick bark rise straight\r\nand massive, with but a slight decrease in diameter, to a height of\r\nupward of 80 feet before the first branch is given off. The cedars, the\r\nintimate companions of the great firs, are of equally gigantic girth at\r\nthe base, but taper rapidly to spire-like summits, usually from 100 to\r\n150 feet above the ground, and are thickly set with small branches\r\nthroughout. They flourish best in excessively moist situations and reach\r\nfar up the mountains, particularly along the numerous watercourses;\r\nwhile the firs, although perhaps most at home on the less thoroughly\r\nwater-soaked uplands, thrive on the banks of streams, the sides and\r\nsummits of hills, and on steep mountainsides alike.\r\n\r\nMere enumeration of the number and size of the trees, however, fails to\r\ngive an adequate impression of the astonishing magnificence of the\r\nwonderful forest of the Puget Sound region. Its grandeur is beyond\r\ndescription, and can only be fully appreciated by one who abides for\r\nweeks or months in its perpetual twilight. The great trees, shaggy with\r\nmosses and lichens of innumerable tints of brown, green, and yellow, do\r\nnot form detached groves, as is so frequently the case in less humid\r\nlands, but are thickly set for mile after mile and league after league,\r\nas one threads his difficult way beneath them. So vast is the forest\r\nthat a person travelling through it soon becomes impressed with the idea\r\nthat it is interminable. Beneath the deep shade of the lofty boughs\r\nthere is a rank undergrowth of young firs, cedars, and hemlocks, while\r\nin the valleys especially, and on the frequently inundated\r\nflood-plains of the streams, there is usually a tangled growth of\r\nvine-like maples, alders, elders, yews, etc. In this lower forest the\r\nmost conspicuous and frequently too abundant plant is the broad-leaved\r\nand excessively spiny devil's-club, the foliage of which changes to\r\nbrilliant yellow in the early autumn, and forms a most artistic setting\r\nfor the spikes of crimson fruit borne at the extremities of the\r\nupward-bending ends of the usually prostrate stems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Douglas Firs, Vancouver, B. C.]\r\n\r\nOf still more lowly habits are the ferns, mosses, and lichens which form\r\na thick, luxuriant, and ever-varied carpet over the black humus soil\r\nbeneath. The ground throughout the forest is encumbered with fallen\r\ntrunks, sometimes piled one on another to the depth of 20 or 30 feet,\r\nwhich, owing to the continuous moisture, remain undecayed for centuries.\r\nNot infrequently a massive cedar or fir, in size and shape not unlike a\r\nprostrate column of some great temple, supports three or more trees,\r\neach large enough to be cut for lumber, whose gnarled and twisted roots\r\nclasp the sides of their host and descend to the earth beneath. The\r\nbeauty of these fallen giants when overgrown with thick layers of\r\nvariegated moss and exquisitely decorated with hundreds of small\r\nhemlocks and a multitude of gracefully bending fern-fronds, always fresh\r\nin colour and usually beaded with moisture, is beyond the power of the\r\nmost skilful artist to adequately portray. The fascination of the\r\ngreat forest is such that the explorer, although perhaps weary with\r\nforcing a passage through the dense undergrowths and climbing over\r\nprostrate trunks, is lured by its charms into more and more inaccessible\r\nretreats probably never before invaded by man, but at last finding that\r\nthe wonderland has no attainable limits, is content to rest on some\r\ninviting couch of golden-tinted lichens and study the varied charms and\r\nendless details of the dream-like picture surrounding him.\r\n\r\nFrom a commercial point of view the forest of the Puget Sound region is\r\nof immense importance. Lumber industries have been established there,\r\nwith the most improved appliances for cutting trees, transporting the\r\nlogs to mills, and sawing them into lumber, much of which is loaded on\r\nships and widely distributed. So vast is the forest, however, that as\r\nyet the natural conditions are but slightly changed, except in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of tide-water, but the destruction from axe and fire\r\nhas only been begun; the waste that, no doubt, is to continue is most\r\ndisheartening.\r\n\r\nAnother centre in the vast and locally differentiated Pacific forest, as\r\ntypical in its way as are the dense growths of fir and cedar just\r\nreferred to, occurs on the Coast Range of north California, where the\r\nredwood (_Sequoia sempervirens_) is the all-important and characteristic\r\ntree. This redwood forest begins at the south in the vicinity of San\r\nFrancisco, and extends northward, mainly on the moist seaward slopes of\r\nthe Coast Ranges, to southwestern Oregon, but seldom reaches more than\r\n30 miles inland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Redwood Forest, California.]\r\n\r\nThe redwood resembles the cedar in habit, general appearance, character\r\nof its wood, and colour of bark and leaves. It flourishes best in moist\r\nlocalities, and attains a great size, surpassing in height and diameter\r\nof stem even the giant firs of Washington, and is only exceeded on this\r\ncontinent by its cousin, the great sequoia (_Sequoia gigantea_) of the\r\nwestern slope of the Sierra Nevada, in south-central California. It\r\nfrequently attains a height of 300 or more feet, with a diameter at the\r\nbase of 15 or 16, and in certain exceptional instances of over 20 feet.\r\nIt rarely branches low, but almost invariably has a straight,\r\nfluted stem, perfectly symmetrical, rising with a slight taper for about\r\n200 feet to the first limb. The foliage is dull green in colour, fine,\r\nand drooping. It is a most beautiful tree both in form and colour, and\r\nis markedly gregarious in habit. As stated by Henry Gannett, it forms\r\nthe densest forest known if the comparison is made on the basis of the\r\namount of merchantable lumber growing on a given unit of area. For\r\nexample, the yellow-pine forests of the Southern Atlantic and Gulf\r\nStates contain on an average about 5,000 feet, board measure (square\r\nfeet of boards an inch thick), of timber per acre, and in the moderately\r\ndense portion of the white-pine forests of the Great Lakes region the\r\naverage is about the same. In each of these regions, famed for their\r\nlumber, a tract containing 10,000 feet of lumber per acre would be\r\nconsidered as heavily forested. In the redwood forests of California,\r\nhowever, 50,000 feet of lumber per acre is not rare over extensive\r\nareas, while for special tracts containing many square miles this\r\nestimate may safely be doubled. Upon 96,443 acres in Humboldt County,\r\nCalifornia, the average amount of lumber contained in the trees still\r\nstanding is 84,000 feet per acre. The returns of lumber companies during\r\na continuous period of ten years from tracts which have been cleared\r\nshow a return of 75,000 to 100,000 feet per acre, but even this is not\r\nthe maximum. A certain tract of several square miles actually yielded\r\n150,000 feet per acre; and there is on record a yield of 1,431,530 feet\r\nfrom a single acre. One tree is said to have furnished 66,500 feet of\r\nlumber, and another, 15 feet in diameter at the base, contained\r\n100,000 feet. Another tree, still standing, measures 22 feet in\r\ndiameter, and it is estimated will yield 200,000 square feet of boards\r\nan inch thick.\r\n\r\nThe wood of the redwood-tree is of a clear red colour with the exception\r\nof a thin layer just under the bark, which is almost pure white, and is\r\nlight, soft, coarse-grained, and susceptible of a high polish. It is the\r\nmost common and most valuable of all the forest products of the Pacific\r\ncoast of North America, and is serviceable for a great variety of\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated \"big trees\" of California are not to be confounded with\r\nthe redwood described above, but belong to a different species of the\r\nsame genus. The big trees are worthy of their name, as they are by far\r\nthe largest in North America. When full-grown they average about 275\r\nfeet in height, with a diameter near the ground of about 20 feet. One of\r\nthe tallest as yet measured has a height of 325 feet, and the largest a\r\ndiameter of 35 feet 8 inches inside the bark and 4 feet above the\r\nground. The age of one of these giants, as shown by the number of rings\r\nof growth in its trunk, is about thirteen hundred years; another, 24\r\nfeet in diameter, is twenty-two hundred years old; and a third showed\r\nover four thousand rings of growth, and must have been in its prime at\r\nthe time of the birth of Christ. The trees occur in detached groves on\r\nthe western slope of the Sierra Nevada in south-central California, but\r\nbecome more common southward, where they form a genuine forest belt.\r\nTheir range from north to south is about 260 miles, and their elevation\r\nabove the sea from 6,000 to 8,000 feet.\r\n\r\n\"So exquisitely harmonious,\" says John Muir, in his charming book The\r\nMountains of California, \"and finely balanced are even the very\r\nmightiest of these monarchs of the woods in all their proportions and\r\ncircumstances, that there is never anything overgrown or monstrous about\r\nthem. On coming in sight of them for the first time, you are likely to\r\nsay, 'Oh, see what beautiful, noble-looking trees are towering there\r\namong the firs and pines!' their grandeur being in the meantime in great\r\npart invisible, but to the living eye it will be manifest sooner\r\nor later, stealing slowly on the senses like the grandeur of Niagara or\r\nthe lofty Yosemite domes. Their great size is hidden from the\r\ninexperienced observer as long as they are seen at a distance in one\r\nharmonious view. When, however, you approach them and walk around them,\r\nyou begin to wonder at their colossal size and seek a measuring-rod.\r\nThese giants bulge considerably at the base, but not more than is\r\nrequired for beauty and safety; and the only reason that this bulging\r\nseems in some cases excessive is that only a comparatively small section\r\nof the shaft is seen at once in near views. One that I measured in the\r\nKing's River forest was 25 feet in diameter at the ground and 10 feet in\r\ndiameter 200 feet above the ground, showing that the taper of the trunk\r\nas a whole is charmingly fine. And when you stand back far enough to see\r\nthe massive columns from the swelling instep to the lofty summit\r\ndissolving in a dome of verdure, you rejoice in the unrivalled display\r\nof combined grandeur and beauty. About 100 feet or more of the trunk is\r\nusually branchless, but its massive simplicity is relieved by the bark\r\nfurrows, which, instead of making an irregular network, run evenly\r\nparallel, like the fluting of an architectural column, and to some\r\nextent by tufts of slender sprays that wave lightly in the winds and\r\ncast flecks of shade, seeming to have been pinned on here and there for\r\nthe sake of beauty only. The young trees have slender simple branches\r\ndown to the ground, put on with strict regularity, sharply aspiring at\r\nthe top, horizontal about half-way down, and drooping in handsome curves\r\nat the base. By the time the sapling is five or six hundred years old\r\nthis spiry, feathery, juvenile habit merges into a firm, rounded dome\r\nform of middle age, which in turn takes on the eccentric picturesqueness\r\nof old age. No other tree in the Sierra forest has foliage so densely\r\nmassed or presents outlines so firmly drawn and so steadily subordinate\r\nto a special type.... The foliage of the saplings is dark bluish green\r\nin colour, while the older trees ripen to a warm brownish-yellow tint,\r\nlike _Libocedrus_. The bark is rich crimson brown, purplish in\r\nyoung trees and in shady portions of the old, while the ground is\r\ncovered with brown leaves and burrs forming colour masses of\r\nextraordinary richness, not to mention the flowers and underbrush that\r\nrejoice about them in their season. Walk in the sequoia woods at any\r\ntime of year, and you will say they are the most beautiful and majestic\r\non earth. Beautiful and impressive contrasts meet you everywhere; the\r\ncolours of tree and flowers, rock and sky, light and shade, strength and\r\nfrailty, endurance and evanescence, tangles of supple hazel-bushes, tree\r\npillars about as rigid as granite domes, roses and violets the smallest\r\nof their kind, blooming around the feet of the giants. Then in winter\r\nthe trees themselves break forth in bloom, myriads of small four-sided\r\nstaminate cones crowd the ends of the slender sprays, colouring the\r\nwhole tree, and when ripe dusting the air and ground with golden\r\npollen.\"\r\n\r\nOwing to the remoteness of the big trees from commercial centres, they\r\nhave escaped to a great extent the destruction which everywhere attends\r\nthe advent of the white man, and some of the finest groves are now under\r\nstate protection.\r\n\r\nThe sequoias are not only of interest on account of their great size and\r\ngrandeur, but from the fact that they are the lingering survivors of an\r\nancient and once widely distributed genus. During the Cretaceous and\r\nTertiary divisions of geological history the genus numbered at least 50\r\nspecies, as has been shown by leaf impressions, fossil wood, and cones\r\nburied in the rocks of New Zealand and Chile on the south, Spitzbergen\r\nand Greenland on the north. Over North America they extend from the\r\nAtlantic to the Pacific. At present the only two species known, both of\r\nwhich, as already stated, are confined to the Pacific coast, and with\r\nthe exception of a slight extension of the less gigantic of the two into\r\nsouthwestern Oregon, are found only in California.\r\n\r\nWhile the firs, cedars, and redwoods form the major portion of the\r\nforests in the more humid regions on the western side of the continent,\r\nthere are two species of pines growing in drier situations which in a\r\ngeneral view are even more characteristic of the Pacific forest\r\nthan are the sequoias. These two pines, well worthy to stand side by\r\nside with the giant firs and still more gigantic redwoods, are known as\r\nthe sugar-pine and the yellow pine.\r\n\r\nThe sugar-pine grows amid the mountains from southwestern British\r\nColumbia, southward through western Washington, Oregon, and on the\r\nSierra Nevada and Coast Ranges of California, at elevations ranging from\r\n4,000 to 8,000 feet. It frequently clothes steep declivities or bids\r\ndefiance to the storms on the crests of sharp ridges. In size it is\r\nscarcely exceeded by any of its companions excepting the firs and\r\nsequoias. It frequently attains a height of from 200 to 275 feet, with a\r\ndiameter at the base of from 8 to 14, and in some instances of over 20\r\nfeet. Individual trees are known which have a height of 245 feet and are\r\n18 feet in diameter. The branches are usually high above the ground and\r\nwidely spreading. In the case of well-grown individuals they leave the\r\nmain trunk with a sweeping, downward curve, which midway out changes to\r\nan upward curve, and at the extreme distal end droops once more. At the\r\nextremity of many of the far-reaching boughs there are suspended one or\r\ntwo cones, each 12 or 14 inches long and sometimes over 8 inches in\r\ndiameter. The peculiar and frequently remarkably regular curvature of\r\nthe great branches, giving them the form of half a Cupid's bow, imparts\r\nto these mighty pines a grace and symmetry possessed by few other trees.\r\nThe familiar name of this great pine refers to the fact that from wounds\r\nor incisions in its trunk there exudes a sweet sap which is considered\r\nby many persons to exceed even the sap of the maple in agreeableness of\r\nflavour.\r\n\r\nLovers of beautiful trees will agree in considering the sugar-pine as\r\nthe noblest of its family growing in the woods of America, if not the\r\nmost majestic of its kindred in the world. Its only rival, but of a\r\ndifferent type of beauty, is the Norfolk Island pine, of the south sea\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nOf the many pleasant memories of camp life in the forests of America\r\nwhich are a source of delight to the writer none are recalled with\r\ngreater pleasure than those associated with the sugar-pine of the\r\nSierra Nevada, where the ground is carpeted with the long brown needles\r\nthat fall in showers at certain seasons from the boughs far overhead.\r\nWith the faded leaves are strewed also the great cones which always\r\nexcite wonder and admiration. In the clear air and brilliant sunlight of\r\nthe Californian mountains the luxuriant plume-like leaves far aloft\r\nappear to be formed of burnished silver or have the yellow of gold,\r\naccording as the light strikes them, and at night the lofty boughs\r\nswayed by the winds make music such as no other forest can produce.\r\nNothing in the vegetable world, not even the great sequoias, convey such\r\nan abiding impression of strength and majesty as these pines which have\r\nwithstood the storms of centuries without losing their vigour or their\r\nsymmetry and beauty of form. Unfortunately as it would seem, however,\r\nthese magnificent trees are useful, as the term is commonly employed,\r\nand are fast falling a prey to lumbermen, who measure their value in\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nThe yellow pine of the Pacific mountains, not to be confounded, however,\r\nwith the yellow pine of the southern Appalachian region, fortunately has\r\nanother common name, the _silver pine_, which is more appropriate and\r\ndistinctive. This is the most widely spread, perhaps, of all the pines\r\nof North America, and is familiar to every one who has travelled through\r\nthe Pacific mountains from British Columbia to Mexico, and from the\r\nBlack Hills of Dakota or the mountains of Colorado and New Mexico\r\nwestward to within hearing of the surf of the Pacific Ocean. It ranks\r\nsecond in size to the sugar-pine, but is a near rival in strength and\r\nnobleness of form. As might be inferred from its wide distribution, the\r\nsilver pine had adapted itself to a great range of conditions, not only\r\nof climate, but of soil and height above the sea. It is found from an\r\nelevation of about 2,000 feet above the sea up the mountainsides nearly\r\nto timber-line, and flourishes alike in the hot, arid valleys and in\r\nregions bordering on perpetual snow and ice. One beautiful feature of\r\nthe silver-pine forests is their open, park-like character. The trees\r\nstand far apart, and thus have room to reach not only a great size,\r\nbut a remarkable degree of perfection of form. Between the\r\nislands of shade on the sunlit ground there is usually but little\r\nundergrowth, and the far-extending natural pastures permit one to ride\r\nin any direction without inconvenience.\r\n\r\nOne other pine of the widely extended Pacific forest demands attention\r\neven from the passing traveller, not on account of its size, for it is a\r\ndwarf in a land of giants, but for its wide distribution and the food\r\nits large, oily seeds furnish for birds, squirrels, and even for man. I\r\nrefer to the pinyon pine, of which there are several species. They are\r\nseldom over 35 or 40 feet high, and are not remarkable for beauty,\r\nalthough they furnish an agreeable feature in the sparsely\r\nforest-clothed and semiarid region where they thrive best, but they bear\r\na profusion of small cones, each of which contains perhaps a dozen\r\nedible and nutritious seeds. These seeds were formerly used by the\r\nIndians for food on an extensive scale, and are still gathered in large\r\nquantities, and may be found in the markets of our cities. The Indian\r\nencampments in the pinyon forests in the fall of the year are among the\r\nmost picturesque features of these degenerate days of the aborigines.\r\n\r\nIn the southwest portions of the United States the forests are confined\r\nto the mountains and the higher table-lands, the hot, arid valleys being\r\nwithout trees other than the larger growths of cacti and yucca. Similar\r\nconditions are present in northern Mexico, but on the western side of\r\nthat republic and throughout practically the whole of the peninsula of\r\nLower California the mountains and valleys alike are treeless and\r\ndesolate.\r\n\r\nAs stated by C. S. Sargent, the forests of North America, exclusive of\r\nMexico, Central America, and the West Indies, contain arboreal\r\nrepresentatives of 158 genera of plants, of which 94 genera occur in the\r\nAtlantic and 59 in the Pacific side of the continent, and 48 genera in\r\nthe tropical portion of southern Florida. Of the number of genera of\r\ntrees in the Caribbean forest we have no reliable census.\r\n\r\n\r\n                PRAIRIES, TREELESS PLAINS, AND PLATEAUS\r\n\r\nTo the west of the Atlantic forest lie the broad natural meadows termed\r\nprairies, and still farther west the yet more extensive pasture-lands of\r\nthe great plateaus which reach the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains\r\n(Fig. 28). The transition from the luxuriant and varied forest on the\r\neast to the treeless, thinly grass-covered plateaus on the west side of\r\nthe interior Continental basin is gradual. The change occurs in the\r\nprairie region, where a struggle has been in progress for thousands of\r\nyears between the conditions favouring and those adverse to tree growth.\r\nThe balance of power, so to speak, is the amount of rain or of\r\nsoil-stored moisture during the summer season. The gradual decrease in\r\nthe mean annual precipitation from east to west on the inland border of\r\nthe Atlantic forest continues westward, and on the plateaus adjacent to\r\nthe Rocky Mountains the aridity is such that no trees can grow except\r\nalong the immediate border of the stream, unless artificially irrigated.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the absence of trees in the central and western\r\nportions of the interior Continental basin is found in the mean annual\r\nrainfall and the manner in which it is distributed throughout the year,\r\ntogether with variations in the texture and composition of the soil, and\r\nthe disturbances in the natural conditions brought about by fires. The\r\nquestion, \"Why are the prairies treeless?\" has been variously answered\r\nby different observers. The outcome of a long discussion in this\r\nconnection seems to be that the main cause of the absence of trees lies\r\nin the climatic conditions and principally in the lack of sufficient\r\nrain during the long, hot summers. Arid regions the world over are\r\nwithout forests, but the Prairie plains cannot be said to be arid; in\r\nfact, the mean annual rainfall over the greater portion of this region\r\nis equal to or exceeds that of many well-forested countries, averaging\r\nas it does in general about 30 inches. But the prairies lie between the\r\nmore humid forest-covered regions on the east and the less humid or\r\nsubarid plateaus on the west, and during the summer season\r\ndroughts and hot, scorching winds are of common occurrence. It is the\r\nlong dry summer that establishes the critical conditions, particularly\r\nabout the eastern and northern borders of the prairies. Of secondary\r\nimportance is the character of the soil. An exceedingly fine soil, like\r\nthat of the prairies, as has been pointed out by J. D. Whitney, by\r\nexcluding the air from the roots of trees is detrimental to their\r\ngrowth. Where the dryness of the summers make the lives of trees\r\nprecarious the nature of the soil, whether coarse or fine, becomes the\r\ncontrolling factor. In the prairie region where the soil is more open\r\nand porous than usual, although other conditions remain the same, as in\r\nthe Cross Timbers of Texas, trees flourish; while intervening areas\r\nwhere the soil is fine are typical prairies. Again, where the climatic\r\nconditions become critical, as during long, dry summers, the grass and\r\nother vegetation burns readily, fire spreads rapidly and widely, and\r\nyoung trees are destroyed. In the prairie region, as pointed out by J.\r\nW. Powell, the Indians were formerly in the habit of burning the grass\r\neach summer in order to insure more favorable pasturage for game during\r\nthe succeeding spring. This annual burning kept back the forest and led\r\nto the eastward extension of the prairie.\r\n\r\nDuring the past decade many groves have been planted on the prairies,\r\nand have flourished, especially when the adjacent fields are cultivated\r\nso as to allow the earth to store a larger share of the winter rain; the\r\nsuccess of this tree planting, it has been claimed, is evidence that the\r\nnature of the soil is not a determining factor in the problem, because\r\ntrees will grow if protected from fire. The success of arboriculture on\r\nthe formerly treeless plains and plateaus, however, decreases as one\r\ntravels westward. On the western border of the prairies and on the great\r\nplateaus, remote from streams, trees can be made to grow only by the aid\r\nof irrigation. If this region had never been swept by fire it is safe to\r\nsay it would still be treeless. Each of the explanations referred to\r\nabove to account for the treeless condition of the prairies--one\r\nreferring it to soil conditions, and the other to the former prevalence\r\nof fires--certainly has much in its favour, and for certain localities\r\nseems satisfactory, but each point of view should include a broader\r\nrange and recognise the fact that the requisite critical conditions have\r\nbeen furnished by wide-reaching climatic causes. The Prairie plains\r\nfurnish but one phase of the gradual change that occurs in the natural\r\nmantle of vegetation when traced from the dense, well-watered forests of\r\nthe Appalachians and the Alleghany plateau westward to the semiarid and\r\ntruly arid lands of the great plateaus and Rocky Mountain region, where\r\nonly such plants as are able to withstand long-continued drought can\r\ngrow. This same broad conclusion is sustained also at the north, where\r\nthe prairie dovetails, as it were, with the subarctic forest.\r\n\r\nThe general or underlying reason for the treeless condition of the vast\r\ncentral portion of the continent is doubtless a lack of sufficient rain.\r\nThe precipitation that does occur comes mainly during the winter season,\r\nwhen the land is colder than the ocean; in summer the land becomes\r\nhighly heated and imparts its temperature to the air, which thus has its\r\ncapacity for moisture increased, and prolonged droughts occur. At the\r\nsouth, in Mexico and the adjacent portion of the United States, the\r\ntrade-winds blow over a region which is more highly heated than the\r\nocean from which they come, and are hence drying winds. To the west of\r\nthe Great plateaus rise the Rocky Mountains, where climatic conditions\r\nare different on account of elevation, and, as we have seen, forests\r\noccur at considerable elevations, but not in the broader valleys. The\r\nconditions unfavourable for tree growth are continued and even\r\nintensified in the valleys of the central portion of the Pacific\r\nmountain region, and culminate in the deserts of the Great Basin and\r\nwestern Mexico. Throughout all of this vast treeless region the\r\ncontrolling condition is deficiency of moisture, particularly during the\r\nsummer or growing season.\r\n\r\nThe nearest approach to desert conditions to be found in North America\r\noccur in the valley of Utah and Nevada and the southern portion\r\nof the Great Basin region in Arizona and Mexico. The bottoms of these\r\nvalleys are, in some instances, occupied by shallow lakes in winter,\r\nwhen scanty rains occur, but during the long, hot summers they become\r\ncompletely desiccated, and are then broad expanses of hard mud, cracked\r\nby drying so as to resemble a tessellated pavement of cream-coloured\r\nmarble. These mud-flats or _playas_ are frequently absolutely without\r\nplant life. Excepting the playas, however, and, in numerous instances, a\r\nnarrow belt of ground encircling them, which is white with efflorescent\r\nsalts, the valleys of even the most arid portion of the Great Basin\r\nregion are generally plant-covered. The most common and most widely\r\nspread of the shrubs on these shadeless plains is the sage-brush. So\r\ncharacteristic is this plant of countless valleys from Canada to Mexico\r\nwithin the general region of the Pacific mountains that to one familiar\r\nwith the country the term \"sage-brush land\" brings to mind the leading\r\nfeatures of the region designated. The sage-brush lands are far from\r\nbeing desert areas, however, for in early spring a profusion of low,\r\nsweet-scented flowers bloom beneath the gray-green _Artemisia_, and\r\nsufficient bunch-grass to sustain considerable herds may be expected in\r\nthe same localities.\r\n\r\nThe vast, irregular belt of forest encircling the central treeless\r\nportion of the continent also dies out on its northern border, where the\r\nsubarctic forest is succeeded northward by the Barren Grounds and tundra\r\nplains. Clearly the explanation of the absence of trees in the prairie\r\nregion and the adjacent plateaus cannot be applied to scarcely less\r\nextensive treeless plains at the far north, where rain falls in summer\r\nand the soil is always abundantly charged with moisture. It needs no\r\nargument to show that the control among the conditions governing tree\r\ngrowth at the north passes to the temperate element of climate, and that\r\nthe timber-line is there determined, as it is on high mountains, by the\r\nseverity of the winters' storms and frosts and the shortness of the\r\nsummers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE TREELESS MOUNTAIN TOPS\r\n\r\nOn the higher mountains of North America above the upper limit at which\r\ntrees are able to grow there are picturesque regions carpeted and\r\ngarlanded in late spring and summer with lovely flowers, the\r\nindescribable charms of which are only known to those who rejoice in\r\nclimbing rugged peaks and in following the trails of the mountain-goat\r\nalong sharp-crested ridges. The gorgeous blossoms of these roof-gardens\r\nof the world are much the same on all high mountains in temperate\r\nlatitudes, but from having become first widely known to civilized man on\r\nthe mountains of Switzerland, are generally termed alpine flowers. The\r\nmost attractive features of an alpine flora, which springs into bloom as\r\nsoon as the snow melts and forms a rapidly widening belt of colour as\r\nthe margins of the snow-fields recede higher and higher, is the great\r\nprofusion of brilliantly coloured blossoms. No sooner does the snow of\r\nwinter melt than the moist ground becomes enamelled in brilliant colours\r\non account of the springing up and quick blossoming of millions of hardy\r\nplants. The growing season on mountain heights is short, but the sun's\r\nenergy is there more intense and the hours of light each day longer than\r\nin the valleys below, and the plants adapted to such conditions pass\r\nthrough their annual circle of changes from sprouting seed to mature\r\nfruit with remarkable rapidity. In many instances the mountain-climber\r\nfinds beautiful lilies unfolding their sun-dyed blossoms at the bottom\r\nof well-like depressions in lingering snow-banks. The gleaming\r\nmountain-peaks when seen from afar are said to be crowned with snow, but\r\nthe mountaineer rejoices in the knowledge that their cold diadems are\r\nwreathed and festooned about their lower margins with lovely blossoms.\r\nMany mountains less ambitious than their neighbours have the garlands\r\nwithout the crown. An alpine flora is present on the Pacific mountains\r\nfrom Mexico northward to Alaska. Like the \"timber-line\" and the\r\n\"snow-line,\" the intermediate belt of profusely flowering herbaceous\r\nplants descends lower and lower with decrease in latitude; on the great\r\nvolcanic cones of Mexico it has an elevation of over 15,000 feet;\r\non the Sierra Nevada the greatest wealth of flowers occurs at about\r\n12,000 feet; on Mount Rainier widely extended gardens resplendent with\r\nrainbow tints occur at 7,000 to 8,000 feet; and about the foot-hills\r\nnear Mount St. Elias, at an elevation of 2,500 feet or less above the\r\nsea, every knoll and island-like area in the vast ice-fields is so\r\ndensely overgrown with brilliantly flowered plants that one has to part\r\nthe rank growths with his hands and press them aside with his alpenstick\r\nin order to force a way through the fields of bloom. Admirers of\r\nnature's loveliness who have not climbed to aspiring heights will find a\r\nnew and beautiful world in the public alpine garden on the summit and\r\nabout the snow-fields of the higher portions of the Pacific mountains,\r\nwhere no sign-boards forbid entry and no fences obstruct the way. In\r\nthese regions nearest the sun and stars there are few, if any, plants of\r\nutility to man, but marvellous beauty and lavish profusion fill the\r\nforeground in every view. These glorious mountain heights have their\r\nuse, however, although as yet known to but few; rest and recreation amid\r\nscenes at the same time novel and most inspiring may there be found by\r\nthe toilers in our crowded cities.\r\n\r\nAmong the Atlantic mountains only a few summits attain a sufficient\r\nelevation to claim a wreath of alpine flowers. Something of the nature\r\nof the gorgeous fields of bloom about the great peaks of the Pacific\r\nmountains is suggested on the treeless summits of the White Mountains,\r\nbut although classed by botanists among alpine floras, the plants\r\ngrowing there fail to give a true idea of the display characteristic of\r\nthe mountains which make a nearer approach to the lower limit of\r\nperennial snow. In the southern Appalachians the absence of a luxuriant\r\nalpine flora is perhaps more than counterbalanced by the profusion of\r\nrhododendrons, azaleas, and laurels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne instructive lesson suggested by this hasty glance at the plant life\r\nof North America is furnished by the quick response that vegetation\r\ngives to conditions of environment. Throughout the greater\r\ndivisions of the forest, prairies, grass-covered plains and valleys, and\r\nflower-decked mountain heights there are constant variations from\r\nlocality to locality in the plant life to meet seemingly obscure or but\r\nslight changes in the conditions of temperature, humidity, exposure to\r\nsunlight, soil composition, soil texture, etc.; and besides there is a\r\nnever-ceasing struggle for existence among the plants themselves which\r\nleads to important modifications of a flora. These changes occur from\r\nlocality to locality, frequently within a short radius, but more than\r\nthis, the resultant of the various modifying conditions on which plant\r\nlife depends are not constant even for a given locality. The study of\r\nextinct floras has shown that during the preceding ages in the earth's\r\nhistory marvellous changes in the plants of many regions, and, in fact,\r\nof the entire earth's surface, have taken place. The distinct\r\nimpressions of palm-leaves, for example, are commonly found in the rocks\r\nof the Cascade Mountains, where spruces, firs, and cedars now dominate\r\nthe landscape. Still more striking is the fact that even treeless\r\nGreenland and the largely ice-covered islands of the arctic archipelago\r\nwere formerly clothed with forests as luxuriant and varied as those now\r\ngrowing in the southern Appalachian region. Although the migrations of\r\nexisting forests during the few centuries of which we have historic\r\nrecords have been too slow to be appreciated by man, yet it is safe to\r\nconclude that changes similar to, and in fact a continuation of, those\r\nknown by geologists to have taken place in the distribution of the\r\nvegetation of the continent since the Tertiary period are still in\r\nprogress. With far-reaching and exceedingly slow changes in climatic\r\nconditions and in elevation above the sea due to upheaval and\r\ndenudation, the plants of our forests, prairies, and mountainsides, are\r\nbeing moved here and there, in ever-changing combinations. Nature thus\r\nsecures a rotation in the vegetation of a region, as the careful\r\nhusbandman varies his crops from year to year. The suggestion in this\r\nconnection furnished by geologists is that we are living in a\r\nspring-time following the great winter, known as the Glacial epoch, and\r\nthat the tropical, temperate, and subarctic forests are migrating\r\nnorthward in an orderly march, and each in turn ascending higher and\r\nhigher on the more lofty mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LITERATURE\r\n\r\n  MUIR, JOHN. _The Mountains of California._ T.

In this connection the fauna of\r\nNorth America presents perhaps even more interesting problems than does\r\nits flora.\r\n\r\n\r\n             GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nIn the study of the distribution of animals over a continent, the\r\ndiscovery of the laws determining the intangible boundaries which the\r\nmembers of a species may not pass is even more difficult than the\r\nsimilar task in the case of plants. Plant species for the most part\r\nadvance and retreat slowly as conditions change, and, with minor\r\nexceptions, there is no freedom of movement for the individual; but\r\nanimals, and especially the higher forms, are sensitive to even slight\r\nchanges in their environment, and there is more or less individual\r\nfreedom to travel over the land, to fly through the air, or to swim\r\nthrough the water. Why the members of a given species which have\r\napparently unlimited power to travel should be confined to a certain and\r\nfrequently a narrowly circumscribed area has excited the curiosity of\r\nman for many centuries.\r\n\r\nA point is gained in reference to the distribution of animal species\r\nwhen it is remembered that animals are either directly or indirectly\r\ndependent on plants for food, and it follows that if plants, as we have\r\nseen, are so largely controlled in their distribution by climate, the\r\nsecret of the distribution of animals is to be sought in the same\r\ndirection. When a thoroughly satisfactory classification of\r\nclimatic provinces is arrived at, it will no doubt be found to agree\r\nwith the larger features of plant distribution, and should coincide,\r\nalthough perhaps less definitely, with the major divisions into which\r\nthe zoologist partitions the earth's surface. This principle has been\r\nrecognised by C. Hart Merriam in subdividing the United States into\r\n\"life-zones and crop-zones,\" and in the following pages his view will be\r\ndiscernible, although losing much of their clearness by reflection.\r\n\r\n_The Place of North America in the Life Realms of the Earth._--The\r\ngeological distribution of animals has been critically studied by P. L.\r\nSclater, A. R. Wallace, T. H. Huxley, and others, and the entire land\r\narea of the earth subdivided into realms, regions, etc., in such a\r\nmanner as to indicate the present grouping of animals. One of the latest\r\nof these broad views of the life of the earth is presented by Richard\r\nLydekker, who, from the evidence furnished by both living and extinct\r\nmammals, has divided the world into three great \"realms,\" two of which\r\nare again subdivided into \"regions,\" as follows:\r\n\r\n                    { 1. Australian region.\r\n    Notogaeic realm  { 2. Polynesian region.\r\n                    { 3. Hawaiian region.\r\n                    { 4. Austro-Malayan region.\r\n\r\n    Neogaeic realm        Neotropical region.\r\n\r\n                    { 1. Malagasy region.\r\n                    { 2. Ethiopian region.\r\n    Arctogaeic realm { 3. Oriental region.\r\n                    { 4. Holarctic region.\r\n                    { 5. Sonoran region.\r\n\r\nIn this classification, North America falls in part in two realms, the\r\n_Arctogaeic_ and _Neogaeic_, the former embracing the table-land of\r\nnorth-central Mexico and all of that portion of the continent lying to\r\nthe northward, while the lowland of Mexico, together with Central\r\nAmerica and the West Indies, falls in the latter realm. The Arctogaeic\r\nincludes also nearly the whole of the eastern hemisphere. The\r\nrelationship expressed in this classification of both the living and\r\nextinct mammalia of North America to that of Eurasia, is supposed to be\r\ndue to a former land connection between the Old and the New World\r\nat Bering Strait, and is most clearly marked by northern species, the\r\nintercontinental bridge being too far north to be available for southern\r\nforms. The mammals and many of the other animals of the low, hot borders\r\nof Mexico and of Central America are a northward extension of the fauna\r\nof South America--that continent constituting nearly the entire Neogaeic\r\nrealm. The mammals of the West Indies are few in species, and have their\r\nnearest relationship with the fauna of the continent to the southward.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      LIFE-REGIONS AND LIFE-ZONES\r\n\r\nThe detailed study of the zoology of North America is far from complete,\r\nbut the voluminous results reached have led to several attempts at broad\r\ngeneralization in reference to geographical distribution. Important and\r\nhighly instructive memoirs have been presented in this connection by J.\r\nA. Allen, Angelo Heilprin, E. D. Cope, and others, who have in the main\r\nattempted to correlate the distribution of animal species, but\r\nprincipally the mammals, with variations in mean annual temperature.\r\nAmong the latest of these contributions, and marking the advance made at\r\nthe close of the nineteenth century, is the classification proposed by\r\nC. Hart Merriam, already referred to in the sketches that have been\r\ngiven of the climate and of the flora of the continent. The basis for\r\nthis classification is the seemingly well-determined law that the\r\nnorthward distribution of terrestrial animals and plants is controlled\r\nby the sum of the positive temperatures for the entire season of growth\r\nand reproduction, and that the southward distribution is governed by the\r\nmean temperature of a brief period during the hotter portion of the\r\nyear. By \"positive temperatures\" is meant the sum of the mean daily\r\ntemperature above that which determines the period of physiological\r\nactivity in plants and of reproductive activity in animals, assumed to\r\nbe 6 deg. C. or 43 deg. F. The exact length of the period to be taken as the\r\nhottest portion of the year has not been definitely determined, but\r\nmust be short enough to fall within the hottest part of the\r\nsummer in high northern latitudes, and probably increases in length from\r\nnorth to south; the time assumed is the six hottest consecutive weeks of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nOn the basis just stated, Merriam has divided North America into the\r\nfollowing life-regions and life-zones:\r\n\r\n +--------+---------+---------------+---------------------------------+\r\n |        |         |               |      Governing Temperatures     |\r\n |        |         |               +-----------------+---------------+\r\n |        |         |               | NORTHERN LIMIT  |SOUTHERN LIMIT |\r\n |        |         |               +-----------------+---------------+\r\n | Realms | Regions |    Zones      |  Sum of normal  |Normal mean    |\r\n |  of    |         |               |   mean daily    |temperature of |\r\n |  Ly-   |         |               |  temperatures   |the six hottest|\r\n | dekker |         |               |   above 6 deg.

In the\r\npublications referred to lists are presented of the resident mammals and\r\nbirds characteristic of each region and of its subdivisions to the north\r\nof Mexico. While the boundaries shown on the accompanying map can be\r\nrecognised in nature by the naturalist and serve a useful purpose, to\r\nthe unskilled observer each region would appear to blend with its\r\nneighbours by intangible gradations. In fact, in this, as in the case of\r\nso many other similar instances in nature, there is an absence of\r\ndefinite, or what may be termed hard and fast lines. The significance of\r\nthe boundaries referred to, to the unskilled observer, is still more\r\nobscure by the fact that the migratory birds, and to some extent the\r\nmammals, annually pass from one zone to another, and besides,\r\nseveral conspicuous mammals and birds are permanent residents in more\r\nthan one zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE MAMMALS\r\n\r\nThe relation of the mammals of North America to the similar animals now\r\ninhabiting other portions of the earth may be briefly shown by\r\nindicating the distribution of the orders into which the mammalia are\r\ndivided. It will be remembered that in general each order is subdivided\r\ninto families, these again into genera, the genera into species, and a\r\nspecies may contain several varieties. The classification here adopted\r\nis the one used by Lydekker in his Manual of Palaeontology. An order when\r\nrepresented in the fauna of a continent is indicated in the following\r\ntable by a plus, and when absent by a minus sign.\r\n\r\n                            CLASS--MAMMALIA\r\n\r\n +-------+-------------+--------------------+--------------------------+\r\n |       |             |                    |    DISTRIBUTION          |\r\n | Sub-  |             |                    +---+---+----+------+------+\r\n |Classes|     Orders  |      Examples      | N.| S.|Eur-|      |Aus-  |\r\n |       |             |                    |Am.|Am.|asia|Africa|tralia|\r\n +-------+-------------+--------------------+---+---+----+------+------+\r\n |      {|1.

Of the _primates_, exclusive of man, the monkeys are the only\r\nrepresentatives in North America. Several species are common in Central\r\nAmerica, but they are absent from the West Indies, and do not occur\r\nnorth of the _terra caliente_ of Mexico.\r\n\r\n2. The bats are world-wide in their distribution, and several genera and\r\nspecies occur on this continent, their northern limit being in central\r\nCanada; during the winter in the United States and Canada they hibernate\r\nlargely in caverns. One family of the _Chiroptera_, the leaf-nosed bats\r\n(_Phyllostomatidae_), are strictly American, having their principal\r\nhabitat in the southern continent, but ranging as far north as the West\r\nIndies, Mexico, and southern California. These are the vampires of which\r\nmany harrowing tales are told. The Central American species are small,\r\nnot larger than an English sparrow, but do not hesitate to attack\r\ncattle, and even men.\r\n\r\n3. The insect-eating mammals are represented by a large number of genera\r\nand species, of moles and shrews, but hedgehogs are absent.\r\n\r\n4. The flesh-eating animals are well represented by the cats (jaguars,\r\npanthers, and lynxes), wolves, bears, racoons, martens, etc. Many\r\nspecies of the seal family occur about the entire coast-line from Panama\r\nto the Arctic Ocean. The lion, tiger, leopard, hyena, are absent.\r\n\r\n5. The rodents are present in great numbers not only of individuals, but\r\nof species and genera; as rats, mice, jumping-mice, squirrels,\r\nporcupines, beavers, rabbits, etc.\r\n\r\n6. The hoofed animals, _ungulates_, are represented by the bison,\r\nmusk-ox, several deer, antelope, mountain-sheep and mountain-goat,\r\ntapir, and swine (peccary). Abundant remains of extinct species of the\r\nhorse family have been found, ranging far back in geological time, but\r\nnative horses are not known to have existed since the coming of\r\nEuropeans. The most notable vacancies in this order in the living fauna\r\nare the rhinoceros, hippopotamus, camel, giraffe, and elephant, although\r\nthese are abundantly represented by fossil forms.\r\n\r\n7. The _Sirenia_, which includes certain large herbivorous marine\r\nmammals of wide distribution, are represented on the borders of the Gulf\r\nof Mexico and the Caribbean Sea by the manatee.\r\n\r\n8. The _Cetacea_ are present in the marine waters adjacent to the coast,\r\nmore especially in the north, where whales of several species, dolphins,\r\nthe narwhal, etc., are found.\r\n\r\n9. Of the _Edentata_, which are so characteristic of the fauna of South\r\nAmerica, and with one exception (the scaly ant-eater, not found in\r\nAmerica) do not occur in the Old World, only the armadillo can be\r\ncredited to North America; of this, two species occur from Texas\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\n10. The marsupials, found nowhere else in the world to-day except in\r\nAustralia and America, are represented by the opossum, of which two\r\nspecies are common in the United States.\r\n\r\n11. The lowest known order of the mammalia, the _Monotremata_,\r\nrepresented in Australia by the duck-billed platypus (Ornithorhynchus)\r\nand the _Echidna_, is unknown in America.\r\n\r\nConsidered in reference to their abundance, large size of individuals,\r\nand number of species, in comparison with the other orders present,\r\nNorth America may be said to be the home of _herbivores_. The only\r\ncontinent in rivalry with it in this respect is Africa. More abundant in\r\nindividuals and species than the herbivorous mammals, however, but\r\nsmaller in size and frequently diminutive, are the rodents. The\r\ncarnivores are fortunately limited in number of species, although the\r\nindividuals of certain species are at times numerous, but not in general\r\ndangerous to man.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SOME REPRESENTATIVE MAMMALS\r\n\r\nTo the general reader the animals of greatest interest are no doubt the\r\nmammals, and particularly those which attract the sportsman, are of\r\nvalue for food, or furnish fur and skins for clothing. Of such animals\r\nthe northern portion of North America and the mountains extending\r\nsouthward into the austral region furnish a large number.\r\n\r\n_The Musk-Ox._--In the far north, mostly beyond the arctic circle, lives\r\nthe musk-ox, the hardiest of herbivores, in which, as expressed in its\r\ngeneric name, _Ovibos_, there is a curious mingling of the\r\ncharacteristics of the sheep and the ox. The teeth are similar to those\r\nof the sheep, the female has but two mammae, and beneath the long\r\nyellowish-brown hair of the outer coat there is a thick wool-like\r\ngrowth. Its gentle, inoffensive nature is also similar to that of the\r\nsheep. The large feet and the horns, however, are like those of the ox\r\ntribe. The horns resemble those of the Cape buffalo, being broad at the\r\nbase and covering nearly the entire forehead. They slope downward at the\r\nsides, and then curve forward and outward, at the same time tapering to\r\na sharp point, which renders them efficient weapons. These\r\ncharacteristics, although intermediate between those of the sheep and\r\nthe ox, are more strongly inclined to the former. In reality, however,\r\nthe musk-ox is more goat-like than sheep-like, as is indicated by its\r\ncovering of hair, its short sturdy legs, the cannon-bone being\r\nremarkably short, and its ability as a climber.\r\n\r\nA full-grown musk-ox measures about 8 feet in length, inclusive of the\r\nshort tail, and is 3 feet, 8 or 9 inches in height at the shoulders. The\r\nthick-set, shaggy body is supported on short stout legs, and the feet\r\nare broad, to serve both as scrapers in clearing away the snow from the\r\nmoss and herbage on which it lives and in climbing ice-covered slopes.\r\n\r\nIts range is over the Barren Grounds of Canada, the islands of the\r\narctic archipelago, and the border of Greenland. Peary found it grazing\r\nin herds in the far north of Greenland beyond the inland ice, and was\r\nsaved from starvation by the food it furnished. Although hardy and well\r\nadapted by nature to withstand the most severe cold, it moves southward\r\nover the Barren Grounds in winter and to some extent at least seeks\r\nshelter in the subarctic forest, but apparently does not pass to the\r\nsouthward of latitude 59 deg.. Like certain other animals of the northern\r\nportion of the continent, its habitat is to the northeastward and it is\r\nunknown in Alaska.\r\n\r\nBones of the musk-ox found in the frozen soil of Siberia indicate that\r\nit formerly had a circumpolar distribution. A skull obtained near Salt\r\nLake City, Utah, in 1871, and the presence of its bones in the\r\nsuperficial deposit of Europe as far south as the Pyrenees, show that it\r\nformerly lived far to the southward of its present southern limit. This\r\nwas during the Pleistocene division of geological history, when glacial\r\nice covered all of Canada and the arctic animals were crowded southward.\r\nAs the ice melted and its southern margin receded, the musk-ox moved\r\nnorthward. The absence of this species in northern Europe and Asia,\r\nwhere the climatic conditions, nature of the vegetation, etc., are\r\nsimilar to those of its present home, is perhaps due to the influence of\r\nman. The successful introduction of the domesticated reindeer into\r\nAlaska suggests that beneficial results would follow the transplanting\r\nof the musk-ox to northern Siberia.\r\n\r\n_The Polar Bear._--About all of the northern coast-line of America,\r\nincluding the shore of Bering Sea and Baffin Bay, lives the well-known\r\npolar bear, which is circumpolar in its distribution. The wide range of\r\nthis the most northern of the bear tribe is due not only to its strength\r\nand ability to make long journeys over rough ice-floes and the wide\r\ndistribution of the animals it feeds upon, principally the hair-seal,\r\nbut is aided by the fact that it takes to the water readily and is a\r\ngood swimmer. It has also been known to make long journeys on floating\r\nice.\r\n\r\n_The Eskimo Dog._--Another animal of circumpolar distribution, the\r\noriginal home of which is unknown, is the Eskimo dog, the range of which\r\nhas no doubt been extended while the distribution of many other animals\r\nhas been curtailed, owing to human influences.\r\n\r\n_The Caribou._--The neighbour of the musk-ox in the desolate solitudes\r\nof the far north, and in part ranging over the same ground, is the\r\ncaribou, the American representative of the reindeer. Indeed the caribou\r\nand the reindeer have been considered as belonging to the same species\r\nby some naturalists, but recently the American division of the genus has\r\nbeen shown to consist of at least five species, each of which\r\ndiffers from the one found in Europe and Asia. Among hunters and\r\nsportsmen, two divisions have long been known, namely, the woodland\r\ncaribou and the Barren Ground caribou. The former includes the larger\r\nspecies, or the caribou proper, as it may be termed, and the recently\r\ndescribed species from Newfoundland and Alaska; while the latter is\r\nrepresented by a single species, the _Rangifer articus_.\r\n\r\nThe woodland caribou is in general about twice the size of the species\r\ninhabiting the Barren Grounds, has a height of 41/2 feet at the\r\nshoulder, and weighs some 250 pounds, although the males sometimes reach\r\na weight of 400 pounds. Its range is from Nova Scotia and Newfoundland\r\nnorthwestward through the subarctic forest to British Columbia and\r\nnortheastern Alaska. As its popular name signifies, its home is in the\r\nforest, and although meeting the smaller form during the latter's\r\nsouthward migrations, it does not extend its range to the Barren\r\nGrounds. On the south, it was formerly found in northern Michigan and in\r\nsouthern New York, and thence eastward through Vermont, New Hampshire,\r\nand Maine. Owing to the activity with which it has been hunted, it has\r\nfor the most part been crowded to the north of the St. Lawrence, and is\r\nreported to be greatly diminished in numbers even in the wilds of\r\nLabrador. It still wanders into the woods of New Hampshire and Maine,\r\nand occurs somewhat abundantly in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. It is\r\nthe caribou of Newfoundland, etc., which comes nearest the reindeer in\r\nsize and in the shape of its magnificent antlers, but none of the\r\nAmerican species has been domesticated.\r\n\r\nThe Barren-Ground caribou still occurs in large herds in northern\r\nLabrador, on the treeless region to the west of Hudson Bay, and in\r\nwinter migrates southward into the shelter of the subarctic forest. In\r\nits northern range it reaches the shore of the Arctic Ocean and the\r\nislands adjacent, and on the west follows the tundra to the Bering Sea\r\ncoast. In Alaska it formerly occurred in immense herds, especially in\r\nwinter, when it made long inland journeys through the forest and across\r\nthe frozen rivers, but the invasion of the region by miners and\r\nthe supplying of the natives with firearms has led to a great reduction\r\nin its numbers. In the barren and but seldom traversed region to the\r\nwest and north of Hudson Bay the caribou is still in its primitive\r\ncondition and moves in bands numbering several thousand. In this\r\nconnection an extract from the journal of J. B. Tyrrell, of the Canadian\r\nGeological Survey, is of interest: \"All day [July 30, 1893] the caribou\r\nhave been around us in vast numbers, many thousands being assembled in a\r\nsingle herd. One herd collected on the hill behind our camp, and another\r\nremained for hours in the wet bog on the point in front of us. The\r\nlittle fawns were running about everywhere, often coming up to within a\r\nyard or two of us, uttering their sharp grunts as they stood and looked\r\nat us or as they turned and ran back to the does. About noon a large\r\nherd had collected on the sides and summit of the hill behind us. Taking\r\na small hand-camera with which we were supplied, we walked quietly among\r\nthem. As we approached to within a few yards of the dense herd, it\r\nopened to let us in and then formed a circle around us, so that we were\r\nable to stand for a couple of hours and watch the deer as they stood in\r\nthe light breeze or rubbed slowly past each other to keep off the black\r\nflies. The bucks, with their beautiful branching antlers, kept well to\r\nthe background. Later in the afternoon a herd of bucks trotted up to us\r\nand stood at about 40 yards distant. This was a most beautiful sight,\r\nfor their horns were fully grown, though still soft at the tips, but\r\nunfortunately we had no camera with us. We did no shooting to-day.\" The\r\nherd of caribou just described was estimated to contain between 100,000\r\nand 200,000 animals.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the woodland caribou in the eastern portion of Canada\r\nhas been so great that it is in danger of being exterminated, and great\r\nsuffering, and even starvation has overtaken the Indians of that region\r\nin consequence. Similar, but even more alarming results have followed\r\nthe thoughtless slaughter of the Barren-Ground caribou in Alaska, and to\r\nprevent the suffering and even threatened extermination of the\r\nnatives, reindeer from Siberia and northern Europe have been introduced\r\nby the United States Government[4] and are thriving under the care of\r\nherders from Lapland. The moss on which the reindeer feed is abundant in\r\nAlaska, and there seems no good reason why they should not become as\r\nnumerous and useful in their new home as they were in the boreal portion\r\nof the Old World. The first reindeer were introduced in Alaska in 1881,\r\nand the several herds, collectively, now number 3,323.\r\n\r\n[4] The introduction of domesticated reindeer into North America is a\r\nvery important matter, and one which if properly conducted will add\r\nvastly to the food supply and resources for clothing for both native and\r\nwhite people. The civilization of the natives in the northern portion of\r\nthe continent and the securing for them of a source of subsistence which\r\nwill depend on their own care and industry hinges on the success of this\r\nundertaking. Much information in this connection may be found in the\r\nreports of Sheldon Jackson, published by the Bureau of Education at\r\nWashington between 1893 and 1900.\r\n\r\n_The Moose._--This, the largest living representative of the deer tribe,\r\nand with the exception of the bison the largest existing land mammal of\r\nNorth America, formerly inhabited the continent throughout its entire\r\nbreadth from the forty-third to the seventieth degree of latitude, or\r\nfrom the mouth of the Ohio to the mouth of the Mackenzie. Although\r\ncrowded northward and now found only sparingly in the United States, as,\r\nfor example, in the extensive forests of Maine and in the still larger\r\nforests clothing the mountains of Montana and Idaho, it has held its own\r\nin the wildest and most remote portions of the Pacific mountains in\r\nCanada and Alaska, where its numbers are perhaps nearly as great as they\r\nwere a century ago. Its preservation is due not only to its shyness,\r\nremarkably quick hearing, and keen sense of smell, but to its solitary\r\nhabits and the fact that it does not gather in herds during the\r\nbreeding season, like most other deer.\r\n\r\nA full-grown male moose is from 7 to 8 feet high at the shoulder, and\r\nfrom 10 to 12 feet high at the tip of the magnificent antlers when\r\nstanding erect, and is from 800 to 1,200 pounds in weight. The\r\nbroad palmate antlers with numerous sharp points sometimes measure 81/2\r\nfeet or more from tip to tip. The does are without antlers, and are\r\nstill more ungainly than the long-legged and apparently awkward males.\r\nStringent laws are now enforced for the protection of the moose in all\r\nof the inhabited portions of its range, and it is likely to survive and\r\nto continue to tempt the sportsman to traverse the wild regions it\r\ninhabits for several generations to come.\r\n\r\n_The Wapiti._--Next in size to the moose, and in many ways the grandest\r\nof the deer tribe not only of America, but of the world, is the wapiti\r\nor American elk. In language not pedantic, W. A. Perry speaks as follows\r\nof this noble animal: \"Monarch of the wilderness, lord of the mountain,\r\nking of the plain, what hunter who has sought thee in thy pine-embowered\r\nhome whose heart-beat does not quicken and whose eye does not brighten\r\nat the mention of thy name! For with it comes the recollection of\r\nboundless prairies, grass-robed and flower-decked; of pine-clad,\r\nsnow-capped mountains; of sweet breezes, gentle melodies, and grand\r\ntrophies. I once heard an Indian speak his last words, and they were\r\nthese: 'To-morrow, in the Spirit Land, again shall I chase the wapiti.'\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the wapiti is one of the typical animals of the boreal region,\r\nin its primitive freedom it overstepped the boundaries of the life-zones\r\nwhich science seeks to define, and marched southward far into the\r\naustral region. It was found at the coming of the white man in nearly\r\nall parts of what is now the United States, and extended from the\r\ntable-land of north-central Mexico northward to the fifty-sixth or\r\nfifty-seventh degree of latitude, or about the position of Lake\r\nAthabasca. Its northern range thus overlapped the region inhabited by\r\nthe moose and caribou, while at the south it was exposed to the attacks\r\nof the jaguar. As civilization advanced across the continent, the wapiti\r\nslowly retreated, and in diminished numbers it now lives in the wildest\r\nportion of the Pacific mountains to the north of Snake River and the\r\nColumbia. It is still abundant in the Olympic Mountains of Washington,\r\nthe Bitter Root Mountains of Idaho, and in Montana. A large herd\r\nfinds protection in the Yellowstone National Park, but in winter, when\r\nmigrating southward, is exposed to most destructive attacks from both\r\nwhite and Indian hunters. Among the mountains of the mainland in British\r\nColumbia and the central and more rugged portion of Vancouver Island it\r\nis still the \"king of the wilderness.\"\r\n\r\nThe male wapiti at maturity is some 7 or 8 feet high at the shoulders,\r\nand lifts its wide-spreading antlers fully 11 feet from the ground. Its\r\nweight is from 800 to possibly 1,100 pounds. The colour is, in general,\r\ndark brown, with lighter shades on the thighs, and changing to black\r\nbeneath the body; there are stripes of light brown on either side of the\r\ntail which join an area of similar colour beneath the hind legs; the\r\ncolour varies, however, at different seasons and in different\r\nindividuals. The head is small, well formed, and beautiful. The carriage\r\nof the animal and its bold, undaunted mien, when roaming its native\r\nmountains and glens, is all and more than poets ascribe to the stag of\r\nthe Old World.\r\n\r\nStringent laws are now on the statute-books for the protection of the\r\nwapiti, both in the United States and Canada, but the difficulties in\r\nthe way of enforcing them in regions remote from civilization are great.\r\nThe wapiti does not extend into the most forbidding wilds of the far\r\nnorth, where its safety as a species, as in the case of the moose, would\r\nbe insured, and besides, congregates in bands, which facilitates its\r\nslaughter. Its range has been steadily decreasing since the coming of\r\nthe white man, and particularly since the introduction of firearms among\r\nthe Indians, and its extinction, outside of reservations and parks, is\r\nto be expected in the near future.\r\n\r\n_The Smaller Deer._--Besides the caribou, moose, and wapiti, there are\r\nhalf a dozen or more members of the deer family (_Cervidae_) represented\r\nin the fauna of North America. Of these the Virginia deer is best known,\r\nas its range embraces the most thickly settled portion of the continent\r\nbetween Maine and the Gulf States, and from the Atlantic coast to the\r\nRocky Mountains. In spite of indiscriminate slaughter and poorly\r\nenforced game laws, this species has not only held its own, but in\r\nrecent years has greatly increased in number in certain localities. To\r\nthe west of the range of the Virginia deer and merging with it in part,\r\nin the Pacific mountain region occur the white-tailed, black-tailed\r\nmule, and sonora deer, and perhaps other species. The combined ranges of\r\nthese several species embrace the larger part of the continent and\r\nextend from eastern Canada to the Pacific coast, and from southern\r\nAlaska to Panama.\r\n\r\nNext to the deer comes the antelope, formerly so common on the Great\r\nplateaus. This, the pronghorn antelope, as it is usually termed, is\r\nabout the size of the domestic sheep, but with long slim legs, and is a\r\nmost active and exceedingly graceful animal. Its true home is on the\r\ntreeless plateaus east of the Rocky Mountains, but its range extends\r\nfrom Saskatchewan to northern Mexico, and from the Prairie plains to the\r\nCascade Mountains in Oregon. It has steadily decreased in number,\r\nespecially during the last quarter of a century, and is now no longer\r\nseen in the large bands that were formerly an attractive feature of the\r\nsea-like plains over which it travels seemingly with the freedom of a\r\nbird.\r\n\r\nThe animals thus far referred to have their range determined mainly by\r\nthe broader features of climate, but not in a conspicuous way by the\r\nrelief of surface. They inhabit mountains, plateaus, and plains alike,\r\nas is shown most conspicuously in the case of the wapiti, which formerly\r\ngrazed in large herds on the prairies of the Mississippi Valley, and has\r\nbeen killed at an elevation of over 10,000 feet in the Pacific\r\nmountains. Not so, however, with the mountain-climbers whose names\r\nfollow, which have their chosen \"station\" on the mountains at\r\ntimber-line and ascend as far above that horizon as vegetation grows.\r\n\r\n_The Bighorn or Mountain-Sheep._--The bighorn, of which three species\r\nare now recognised, has its home in the Pacific mountains from northern\r\nMexico to central and northern Alaska. Its vertical range is also great,\r\nas it has been seen on the precipitous walls of the Grand Canyon of\r\nthe Colorado, but a few hundred feet above sea-level, and about\r\nthe summits of the peaks of Colorado and in the Sierra Nevada and\r\nCascade Mountains at elevations of from 10,000 to 13,000 feet. An\r\nexception to the fact that the bighorn is usually found on rugged\r\nmountains and is most at home on seemingly inaccessible cliffs is\r\nfurnished by bands which live and appear to thrive amid the Bad Lands\r\nalong the Missouri River, some 400 miles to the eastward of the Stony\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nThe bighorn resembles the wapiti in colour, although it is of a lighter\r\nbrown, especially in winter. It is clothed with wool beneath the stiff\r\nouter coat of hair, and is a true sheep, but larger than any\r\ndomesticated variety of _Ovis_. The rams attain a height of at least 3\r\nfeet 6 inches at the shoulder, and weigh some 300 or 400 pounds. Both\r\nsexes are provided with horns, but those of the male are much the\r\nlarger, and in the finest examples attain a length of 30 inches,\r\nmeasured along the outer curve, and a circumference at the base of 15 or\r\n16 inches. The most magnificent head ever obtained, so far as the writer\r\nhas been able to learn, is that of a ram shot in the Selkirk Mountains,\r\nthe horns of which are 521/2 inches in length, measured along the outer\r\ncurve, and 181/2 inches in circumference at the base. These immense\r\nhorns are used, as in the case of the domestic ram, in fighting, but the\r\nwidely current statement in reference to the animals alighting on them\r\nwhen jumping from precipices is entirely mythical. The bighorn is a\r\nfearless and skilful mountaineer, and will climb or descend precipices\r\nby bounding from ledge to ledge where the most reckless hunter dares not\r\nfollow. Its ability to find a sure footing on even smoothly glaciated\r\nrocks is due to the peculiar structure of the feet, which have a\r\nrubber-like pad beneath the sharp-pointed and sharp-edged hoofs.\r\n\r\n_The Mazama or Mountain-Goat._--The companion of the bighorn on the\r\nlofty mountains, but even more thoroughly a mountaineer, is the\r\nso-called mountain-goat, _Aplocerus montanus_, which, in spite of its\r\nlong hair, short curved horns, sturdy legs, bearded chin, and general\r\ngoat-like appearance, and more than the goat's ability to climb,\r\nis in reality more nearly related to the antelope than it is to the\r\nsheep. This alpine antelope, unlike its cousin of the plains, is only at\r\nhome on dizzy heights, and summer and winter alike lives at timber-line\r\non the mountains or in the alpine gardens adjacent to perpetual snow.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest generic names under which it is assumed this alpine\r\nantelope was included, namely, _Mazama_, although rejected by\r\nnaturalists, has recently been revived and adopted by an enthusiastic\r\nmountaineering club in Portland, Oregon, as their name, and is likely to\r\nbecome widely known. Among the hunters and the inhabitants generally of\r\nthe region where the animal under consideration lives it is termed the\r\nmountain-goat, and no protest from naturalists, however well founded, is\r\nlikely to bring about a change in this connection.\r\n\r\nThe mazama is entirely white, excepting its hoofs, horns, and narrow\r\nlines about the eyes and nostrils, which are black. In general, it is\r\nsmaller than the bighorn, but bucks have been reported to attain a\r\nlength of nearly 6 feet and a weight of some 300 or 400 pounds. Its\r\nhabitat is not only higher on the mountains but more restricted in\r\ngeographical extent than that of the bighorn. It is said to live about\r\nMount Whitney, the highest summit in the Sierra Nevada, but is unknown\r\nfarther south; in Colorado it is reported to have been seen on a few of\r\nthe higher peaks, but its main range begins well to the north of these\r\noutlying localities, in the mountains of Montana and Idaho and in the\r\nCascades. To the north of the United States it occurs throughout the\r\nhigher ranges of British Columbia and in the mountains of southern\r\nAlaska as far west at least as Cook Inlet. It is plentiful and as yet\r\nundisturbed by hunters on the foot-hills about Mount St. Elias, where\r\nthe alpine conditions congenial to it occur at an elevation of from\r\n2,000 to 3,000 feet above the sea. Like all of the larger animals, and\r\nespecially the herbivores, the bighorn and the mazama are sought by\r\nsportsmen, but on account of the ruggedness of the regions they inhabit\r\nand their wariness they are likely to survive when most other examples\r\nof \"big game\" shall have been exterminated. Both the bighorn and\r\nthe mazama are sought by Indians for food and for their pelts, and their\r\nhorns are frequently used, especially in Alaska, in the manufacture of\r\nspoons. They are practically of no economic importance to white men,\r\nalthough their flesh when young is excellent food, and their fleeces\r\nwould be of value to the weaver if they could be obtained in sufficient\r\nquantity. They serve, however, to entice the sportsman, who is usually\r\nan ardent lover of nature, into some of the wildest and grandest regions\r\nthe continent affords. Their value in this connection is not to be\r\nmeasured in dollars, and strenuous efforts should be made to insure\r\ntheir continuance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Bison at Silver Heights, Winnipeg. (Photograph\r\nby William Notman & Son.)]\r\n\r\n_The Bison._--Of all the larger mammals of North America, none was more\r\nnumerous at the time Europeans advanced over the continent than the\r\nbison or \"buffalo\" (_Bos americanus_), and none more important alike to\r\nthe Indian and the white man. The part played by this relative of the\r\ndomestic ox in the history of the country is not only instructive, but\r\none of the best illustrations that can be furnished of the practical\r\nextermination of a species through the greed and lack of forethought of\r\nso-called civilized man.\r\n\r\nThe bison is a shaggy, brown animal, about the size of the well-known\r\nDurham breed of cattle, but with a larger head and a prominent hump on\r\nthe shoulders (Fig. 31). The hind quarters are small in comparison with\r\nthe massive head and shoulders, and appear weak. The head, neck,\r\nshoulders, and fore legs are covered with thick matted hair, at times 16\r\ninches long and of a dark-brown colour merging into black. The straight\r\nblack hair beneath the chin of the bull is usually some 10 inches in\r\nlength, and as the animal carries its head low, frequently sweeps the\r\nground. Back of the medial portion of the body the hair is short and of\r\na yellowish-brown colour, or \"between dark umber and a living-liver\r\nbrown,\" as Audubon says. There is much variation in colour, however, and\r\ndistinct varieties have been stated to exist. The horns, hoofs,\r\nand a bare space about the nostrils and mouth are black.\r\n\r\nThe weight of a fully grown bull is about 2,000 pounds, and of a cow\r\n1,200 pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Range of the Bison.]\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of the region in which the bison has been seen by white\r\nmen, together with the dates of its extermination in various sections of\r\nthe country, etc., are shown in Fig. 32. In about 1870 the vast herd\r\nwhich ranged over the treeless plateaus and Prairie plains between the\r\nRio Grande and Great Slave Lake was divided, owing to the great\r\nslaughter that occurred in the vicinity of the Central Pacific Railroad,\r\ninto two herds, one of which had its summer range in Montana and\r\nneighbouring territory, but moved northward in summer into\r\nCanada, while the other fed on the plains of the west Texas region in\r\nwinter and moved northward in summer as far as southern Nebraska. In\r\neach case a southward movement was begun as winter approached, but these\r\nseasonal changes scarcely warrant the name of migrations.\r\n\r\nThe number of these large animals living between the Mississippi and\r\nRocky Mountains previous to 1872, even after being hunted for centuries\r\nby the Indians and killed in constantly increasing numbers each year by\r\nwhite men for half a century, can only be reckoned in millions. Many\r\ntrustworthy observations are on record, however, from which the vastness\r\nof the herds can be approximately judged. For example, R. I. Dodge thus\r\nrefers to a herd which he passed through in the Arkansas Valley in May,\r\n1871, when it was moving northward: \"The great herd could not have\r\naveraged, _at rest_, over 15 or 20 individuals to the acre, but was not\r\nless than 25 miles wide, and from reports of hunters and others it was\r\nabout five days in passing a given point, or not less than 50 miles\r\ndeep. From the top of Pawnee Rock I could see from 6 to 10 miles in\r\nalmost every direction. This whole vast space was covered with buffalo,\r\nlooking at a distance like one compact mass, the visual angle not\r\npermitting the ground to be seen.\" From this and other observations, W.\r\nT. Hornaday has estimated that the herd referred to numbered not less\r\nthan 4,000,000 individuals. From the records kept by railroad companies\r\nof the number of skins shipped over their lines and other evidences, it\r\nhas been computed that of the southern herd mentioned above over\r\n3,500,000 individuals were killed during the years 1872, 1873, and 1874.\r\nThe northern herd seems to have been at least as large as the southern\r\none, so that the entire number on the Great plateaus in any one year for\r\nthe decade preceding 1870 was not less than 8,000,000, and even this\r\nvast number seems to be an underestimate.\r\n\r\nThe great slaughter of the southern herd occurred from 1872 to 1874, and\r\nof the northern herd ten years later. In 1889, as stated by Hornaday,\r\nthe bisons running at large in North America numbered but 635. In\r\n1902 the number of bison in the United States was reported to be 800,\r\nthe increase being due to protection extended to the herds, and perhaps\r\nalso to a more accurate count.\r\n\r\n_Fur-Bearing Animals._--Of the animals of North America which are taken\r\nfor their fur, the seal and sea-otter have already been referred to in\r\nconnection with the brief review presented of the life of the\r\ncontinental shelf. As is well known, the colder regions of the earth are\r\nthe ones which yield the most valuable furs, and in the fur trade of the\r\nworld this continent, on account of its wide expansion at the north, has\r\ntaken the leading place as a producer. In fact, the fur trade is a\r\nprominent feature in the history of America, and one whose followers\r\nexperienced great vicissitudes and countless adventures.\r\n\r\nThe animals that tempted the tireless and fearless sons particularly of\r\nFrance, England, Scotland, and Russia to build their fortified\r\ntrading-posts throughout the subarctic forest from the St. Lawrence to\r\nthe Mackenzie and Yukon, were principally the beaver, sable, ermine,\r\nfox, mink, wolverene, bear, otter, wolf, lynx, musk-rat, skunk, marmot,\r\netc. Nearly all of these animals are forest dwellers, and several of\r\nthem, as the beaver, otter, mink, and musk-rat, haunt the shores of\r\nstreams and lakes. Of the sable, there are two species, known as the\r\nmarten and the fisher. The bears are represented by at least four\r\nspecies. The foxes number at least a dozen species, of which four are\r\nespecially prized for the beauty of their fur, namely, the arctic, red,\r\ncross, and silver.\r\n\r\nWhile the fur-bearing animals named above are characteristic of the life\r\nof the boreal region of North America, a number of the species, and, in\r\nfact, nearly all of them, range southward into the austral region,\r\nespecially in the more humid and generally forest-covered portions of\r\nboth the Pacific and Atlantic mountains, while one of the most important\r\nas regards the beauty of its fur--the otter (_Lutra canadensis_),\r\nfrequently termed the land-otter, in order not to confound it with its\r\nlarger and far more valuable cousin, the sea-otter (_Enhydra\r\nmarina_)--reaches the torrid region and is still living in\r\nFlorida, and has been reported as occurring in Central America.\r\n\r\nOf all the fur-bearing animals referred to above, the most valuable when\r\nthe total number of skins that have been taken is considered, and in\r\nmany ways the most interesting, is the beaver, of which but one living\r\nspecies (_Castor canadensis_), closely allied to the beaver of northern\r\nEurope, is known in America. Fully grown individuals are about 3 feet in\r\nlength, one-third of which is to be credited to the broad, flat,\r\nscale-covered tail, and weighs some 50 or 60 pounds. The outer coat of\r\nits pelage consists of rather coarse brown hair, beneath which there is\r\na fine, soft, dark fur, which makes its skin of commercial value. In\r\ndressing the skins the hair is plucked, the fine fur beneath being\r\nclipped to a uniform length and usually dyed. The formerly well-known\r\nbeaver hat was made from this fur, but in recent years silk has taken\r\nits place. The importance of the American beaver is illustrated by the\r\nfact that some 7,000,000 skins have been sold in London by the Hudson's\r\nBay Company since the year 1752. Not only is the fur of the beaver in\r\ndemand, but its flesh, and especially the muscles of the tail, are\r\nprized for food by hunters and others who live the free, open-air life\r\nof the frontier, although it is seldom exposed for sale in the markets\r\nof cities.\r\n\r\nThe beaver is of interest to the geographer not only on account of its\r\nwide distribution, which embraced the entire continent wherever the\r\nwillow, birch, alder, etc., on which it subsisted, could grow, from\r\nnorthern Mexico to the Arctic Ocean, but for the reason that it made\r\nmore conspicuous and lasting changes in the minor features of the\r\nsurface of the land than any other mammal. One of its peculiar habits is\r\nthat it gnaws down trees frequently 6 or 8 inches in diameter, and after\r\ncutting them into sticks a few feet in length, uses them in making dams\r\nacross small streams. These dams were built in thousands and tens of\r\nthousands all through the forested regions, and being plastered with\r\nmud, and still further enlarged and strengthened by the accumulation of\r\ndriftwood and leaves, held the waters of the streams in check and\r\ncaused them to expand so as to form small lakes, ponds, and swamps.\r\nThese beaver-dam lakes are common even at the present day, and many of\r\nthem which have been filled with sediment or drained furnish rich lands,\r\nnow utilized for gardens and cultivated fields. In Michigan these\r\nbeaver-dam lakes furnish the rich black soil so favourable for the\r\nraising of celery and other vegetables. The beaver has disappeared from\r\nall but the wilder and more inaccessible portions of the continent, but\r\nthe influence of the changes it made in the drainage of the land will\r\nendure for many generations to come.\r\n\r\nOf the fur-bearing animals mentioned above, none are more definitely\r\nAmerican than the skunks, or, to use a more felicitous name, _Mephitis_,\r\nwhich ranges from central Canada to central Mexico, and is represented\r\nby four or five species. As stated by Elliott Coues in his instructive\r\nmonograph on the North America _Mustelidae_, the skunks are closely\r\nrelated to the badgers, being heavy-bodied, short-legged, stout in\r\nbuild, with hairy tails and generally loose pelage. They neither climb\r\ntrees nor swim in water; their gait is slow, and they do not allow\r\nthemselves to be hurried, even in the face of danger; their retreats are\r\nburrows in the ground or dens in rocks and hollow logs, and sometimes in\r\nthe nooks and corners of dwellings and outhouses. Their most common\r\nrepresentative, _Mephitis mephitica_, is a beautiful animal some 15 or\r\n20 inches in length, exclusive of its bushy tail, which is usually 12 to\r\n15 inches long. The head is small, the ears low and short, and the hair\r\nof a glossy black, relieved by conspicuous white markings which are not\r\nonly irregular in shape, but vary with individuals. The most marked\r\ncharacteristic of the skunks is their ability to emit at will a fluid\r\nwhich has the most disagreeable and sickening odour known. This fluid is\r\nsecreted in two glands, each about one inch in diameter, situated at the\r\nbase of the tail and opening into the rectum, but has no connection with\r\nthe secretions of the kidneys, and is probably seldom discharged except\r\nwhen the animal is annoyed. It is a unique and most efficient\r\nmeans of defence. In this connection it is to be remembered, however,\r\nthat the skunks belong to the family _Mustelidae_, which is characterized\r\nin part by the odoriferous secretions present in its various species,\r\nbut, above all others, the odours emitted by the genera under\r\nconsideration are the most dreadful. The stench produced by these\r\nanimals when startled or enraged is not only horrible beyond\r\ndescription, but endures for months and even a year or more. The yellow\r\nliquid which is ejected is squirted in a fine spray for a distance of\r\nsome 6 or 8 feet, but its odour may sometimes be perceived, even when\r\nthe wind is still, for a distance of a quarter of a mile.\r\n\r\nThe skunk having this one unconquerable means of defence from all its\r\nenemies except man, exhibits evidence of degeneration in other respects.\r\nWhen discharging its odoriferous fluid it faces its enemy, who is held\r\nat bay or retreats, and hence, not being compelled to run, has acquired\r\na slow, wavering gait and deliberate movements; having no occasion to\r\nascend trees for safety, it has lost or failed to develop the ability to\r\nclimb; and its lack of other powers which are highly developed in its\r\nnear of kin may be used in illustration in a similar way. It is\r\npractically removed from the attacks of enemies excepting dogs and other\r\ncanines and some birds of prey, but has to adapt itself to conditions of\r\nclimate and food supply. In winter in the northern portion of its\r\nhabitat it becomes more or less torpid, and during the coldest weather\r\nusually hibernates, thus lessening the exertion required to procure\r\nsustenance. When the temperature is not excessively low it seeks its\r\nfood, which consists of insects, birds' eggs, small reptiles, mice,\r\netc., and in settled regions visits the poultry-yards, and thus\r\nincreases the enmity extended to it by all mankind, who have ever been\r\ndisgusted by its odours. Another objectionable fact in reference to this\r\ndespised yet, we may perhaps say, respectfully treated animal, is that\r\nits bite sometimes produces hydrophobia.\r\n\r\nThe skunks are not only widely distributed in North America, occupying\r\nperhaps a larger area in the austral than they do in the boreal region,\r\nbut are influenced to a less extent by climatic and topographic\r\nconditions than probably any other genera among our mammals. It lives\r\namong mountains and on plateaus and plains, and in forests as well as on\r\nthe open prairies, and extends from humid regions like eastern Canada\r\nand New England to the dry, semi-desert valley of New Mexico, and from\r\nthe cold shores of the Great Lakes and central Canada to the warm Gulf\r\nStates. Although offensive, and everywhere declared a nuisance, and\r\npersecuted as such, as well as trapped and hunted for its pelt, its\r\nrange has been decreased but little since the settlement of the country\r\nby Europeans, although its numbers are greatly reduced. Its beautiful\r\nfur when deodorized and dyed of a uniform black is sold under the name\r\n\"Alaskan sable,\" \"black marten,\" \"American sable,\" etc., and is\r\nextensively worn even by the most fashionably attired dames of every\r\nland.\r\n\r\n_The Bears._--Of the bears native to North America, as was stated by S.\r\nF. Baird in 1857, the number of species is somewhat indefinite, but four\r\nare commonly recognised and mention is sometimes made of two others.\r\nThis uncertainty as to the number of species of the genus _Ursus_, I\r\nbelieve, still exists, and in itself is significant. If the bears have\r\nnot been satisfactorily classified, as is apparently the case, it\r\nsuggests that they exhibit great variations and that the drawing of hard\r\nand fast specific boundaries among them is difficult, and perhaps\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe species which are usually recognised are the polar bear, the\r\ngrizzly, the cinnamon, and the black. Of the black and brown or cinnamon\r\nbears there seems to be several varieties, some of which are perhaps\r\nworthy of being considered species. On the other hand, it must be\r\nremembered that Baird and others makes the cinnamon a variety of the\r\nblack bear. Again the grizzly and cinnamon intergrade in such a manner\r\nthat an experienced naturalist has considered them to be but extremes of\r\na single species.\r\n\r\nThe polar bear is distinguished from its kindred, at least in a general\r\nway, by its large size and white or yellowish-white colour. These and\r\nother differences from its relatives have led naturalists to place it in\r\na distinct genus, of which it is the only species. It is\r\ncircumpolar in its distribution, and in America occurs along the coast,\r\nseldom travelling inland except during the breeding season, when it is\r\nsometimes met with 25 miles from the ocean. Its southern range on the\r\nAtlantic coast is in northern Labrador, but it is occasionally carried\r\non floating ice as far south as Newfoundland. It inhabits the shores of\r\nHudson Bay and the Arctic Ocean. On the west coast it reaches Bering\r\nStrait, and is carried on floating ice to the islands in the northern\r\npart of Bering Sea, and at rare intervals reaches the Pribilof Islands.\r\nIt is probably strictly carnivorous, and lives principally on the seal.\r\nIt is supposed to be the largest of the bear tribe, but is certainly\r\napproached if not rivalled in size by the brown bear of southern Alaska.\r\nAs many arctic explorers testify, it is dangerous to man and will lead\r\nin an attack.\r\n\r\nThe famous grizzly or \"silver tip\" inhabits the Pacific mountains, but\r\nis best known in the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada. Although like\r\nall kindred species presenting conspicuous individual variations, it is\r\nusually dark in colour, with white tips to some of the hairs. The pelage\r\nis long, almost shaggy, and gives the animal even a more formidable\r\nappearance than its great size and strength justifies. It is not only\r\none of the largest of the American bears, ranking in this respect with\r\nthe polar bear and the largest of the huge brown bears, but is also\r\nprobably the fiercest, and not infrequently has been known to attack\r\nman, although it will usually retreat from the presence of human beings\r\nif an opportunity is available. Full-grown individuals are about 8 feet\r\nin length and weigh in the neighbourhood of 1,000 to 1,200 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe brown bear, of which there are perhaps three species, including the\r\nBarren-Ground bear of the north-central part of Canada, are, as their\r\nname signifies, of a brown or cinnamon colour, but present great\r\nvariation in this respect. Some are of a decided yellow, while others\r\nbecome dark and are scarcely distinguishable from the true grizzly. They\r\nreach a great size, particularly in southern Alaska, and possibly in\r\ncertain instances even exceed the polar bear in dimensions and\r\nweight. The tracks of one which I measured near Mount St. Elias were 16\r\ninches long by 8 inches wide, and the stride was 64 inches. The range of\r\nthe brown bear is confined principally to the Pacific mountains, but is\r\nof greater extent than that of the true grizzlies and includes central\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nThe black bears are of almost continental distribution and occurred in\r\nall or nearly all wooded districts before the balance of natural\r\nconditions was disturbed by the coming of the white man. They are the\r\nsmallest of the bear tribe on this continent and are usually harmless,\r\nbut at times when attacked or approached suddenly, especially if\r\naccompanied by their young, become formidable enemies. Their colour is\r\nusually a glossy black, but much variation occurs, especially about the\r\nhead, and this and other differences are thought by some to indicate\r\nspecific distinctions. A seemingly well-marked variety occurring in\r\nsouthern Alaska, which has a thick bluish-black under-fur, has recently\r\nbeen described as a distinct species.\r\n\r\nNear relatives of the bear are the racoons, of which several species are\r\npresent, one being abundant in the eastern portion of the United States\r\nand the other in the Pacific mountains.\r\n\r\n_The Cats._--The _Felidae_ are represented by two genera, _Felis_ and\r\n_Lynx_, each of which contains several species.\r\n\r\nOf the true cats, the largest is the beautiful jaguar, or American\r\ntiger, _Felis onza_, which is nearly as large, and by some said to be\r\nequal in size to its Asiatic relative. It more nearly approaches the\r\nleopard, however, in the character of its spots as well as in its\r\narboreal habit, but exceeds it in size. The jaguar is some 4 feet or\r\nmore in length to the base of the tail, and the tail is about 3 feet\r\nlong. Its general colour is a soft-yellowish passing into dark brown and\r\nblack, with large rosette- or somewhat lozenge-shaped spots, which take\r\nthe form of indefinite rings of dark fur with lighter centres, within\r\nwhich there are one or two dark dots or eyes. The skins are fully as\r\nbeautiful as those of the tiger or leopard, and are highly prized for\r\nrugs, and in some cases have been used for clothing. A dark,\r\nnearly black variety (or perhaps more properly, examples of melanism)\r\nhas been described as a distinct species, and is sometimes spoken of as\r\nthe black tiger.\r\n\r\nThe centre of distribution of the jaguar is probably in the great\r\nAmazonian forest, but it ranges over nearly all of South America,\r\nthroughout Central America, and extends northward to Texas and perhaps\r\nLouisiana.\r\n\r\nNext to the jaguar in importance is the widely known panther. Unlike\r\nmost of its relatives, this species has an essentially uniform colour.\r\nThe fur on the back, head, and tail is of a tawny brownish-yellow, but\r\nvaries somewhat with changes in seasons. The under parts are of a dirty\r\nwhite. The animal when full-grown is of a formidable size, the larger\r\nexamples being nearly 5 feet long from the tip of the nose to the base\r\nof the tail. The stout cylindrical tail is from 20 to over 30 inches\r\nlong. In spite of its size and great strength the panther is not to be\r\nfeared so long as room for its escape is open, as it is a great coward.\r\nOne of the most interesting facts concerning this species is its\r\nunusually great range. Before being disturbed by white men it inhabited\r\npractically the entire width of both North and South America, from\r\nHudson Bay to Patagonia, an extreme range of some 110 degrees of\r\nlatitude. It is most at home in the mountains and is seldom seen on open\r\nplains. It is still common in the Pacific mountains of the United States\r\nand Canada.\r\n\r\nOf the smaller cats, several of which are beautifully marked, mention\r\nmay be made of the ocelot of the Texas region and the lynx or American\r\nwildcat. The latter, of which there are at least three varieties, is yet\r\ncommon, and maintains approximately its original range, which embraces\r\nthe entire width of the continent from the subarctic forest at least as\r\nfar south as northern Mexico.\r\n\r\n_The Wolves._--In the history of the establishment of English colonies\r\nin this country, and throughout the spread of civilization across the\r\ncontinent, many accounts are given of encounters with wolves. These\r\nstories as they have been handed down have probably in many instances\r\nbeen magnified, but there is no doubt but that the larger wolves,\r\nsuch as the gray timber-wolf, once common in the northern portion of the\r\nUnited States, when assembled in packs and pressed by hunger, were\r\nformidable antagonists.\r\n\r\nOf the wolves, four species are usually recognised, but their great\r\nvariation, in each instance, has led to the description of numerous\r\nvarieties, some of which have by certain writers been given the dignity\r\nof distinct species. The largest is the gray wolf, which is white or\r\ngrizzly gray in colour, and frequently 5 feet or more in length and\r\nweighs 50 to 60 pounds. Individuals have been killed, however, which\r\nexceed these measures. The range of this species, or group of species as\r\nthe case may be, was originally continental, but more particularly in\r\nthe forested regions. Its hair, which is frequently 4 inches or more in\r\nlength, and the fine thick under-fur make the skins valuable for robes,\r\nbut they are seldom used for clothing, except by the Indians and\r\nEskimos. The hood of the outer garment worn by Eskimos, termed a parkie,\r\nis frequently fringed about the face-opening with the long warm hair of\r\nthe wolf.\r\n\r\nA smaller species, the coyote, is still common on the western plains,\r\nand is termed the prairie-wolf. It is a comparatively small animal,\r\nalthough frequently 3 feet in length of body with a bushy tail\r\ntwo-thirds as long, and is of a skulking, cowardly nature. Its colour is\r\nusually a yellowish gray, and its skin, although used for robes, is much\r\ninferior to that of the gray wolf. Its range is from northern Mexico\r\nnorthward throughout the great plateaus, and in the valleys of the\r\nPacific mountains into Canada. It is usually the first of the larger\r\nmammals the traveller in that region learns the existence of, even at\r\nthe present day. Several individuals frequently gather together just\r\nafter sunset and make their presence known by barking and howling in\r\nconcert. These serenades last but a short time, however, and are likely\r\nto be repeated in the morning just before sunrise. During the night the\r\nanimals composing these bands seem to scatter and hunt for food\r\nsingly, but reunite in the early morning, after which they again\r\nseparate and seek secluded individual retreats.\r\n\r\n_Brief Mention of Other Mammals._--In order to convey an adequate idea\r\nof the large variety and richness of the North American mammalian fauna\r\nfar more space would be required than is at present available. Indeed,\r\nof the smaller mammals much more research is evidently needed before\r\neven the number of genera and species can be enumerated, much less their\r\nlife histories and economic importance made known, as is indicated by\r\nthe fact that a large number of species previously recognised has been\r\ndescribed during the past two or three years.\r\n\r\nOf the abundant smaller mammals, none are more attractive or beautiful\r\nthan the arboreal squirrels, of which several species are widely known.\r\nOne of these, the common red squirrel, is remarkable for its wide range\r\nand adaptability to a great variety of conditions. It is abundant in the\r\nvalley of the Yukon and even north of the arctic circle, throughout the\r\nforest-covered portions of Canada, and as far south as the South\r\nAtlantic States. Of less extensive range is the gray squirrel and the\r\nblack squirrel, common in New England, and the somewhat larger and yet\r\nmore beautiful fox squirrel of the central part of the continental\r\nbasin. There are also a large number of species of ground squirrels, and\r\nseveral species of flying-squirrels. The rodents are also represented by\r\nthe marmots, certain species of which are exceedingly numerous near\r\ntimber-line in many of the ranges of the Pacific mountains as far north\r\nat least as Mount St. Elias, and by gophers, chipmunks, lemmings, the\r\nmusk-rat, porcupines, rabbits, hares, rats, mice, etc. The list might\r\nalso be extended by enumerating the bats, shrews, and moles, but we are\r\ncompelled to cut short this most interesting portion of our review.\r\n\r\n_Mammalian Families Peculiar to America._--While there are many genera\r\nand species of mammals found only on this continent, the number of\r\nfamilies that are peculiar to it is small. Among the characteristic\r\nfamilies, most of which, however, extend into South America, none are of\r\ngreater interest in the study of geographical distribution than\r\nthe opossums, of which there are 3 genera and some 22 species, all of\r\nthem confined to the New World. Of these, two species are common in\r\nNorth America: one, the Virginia opossum, abundant throughout the\r\neastern portion of the United States to the south of New York, and the\r\nother and smaller species, which inhabits Mexico and extends northward\r\ninto southern California and Texas. Many representatives of this same\r\nfamily occur in Central and South America, some of which are notable on\r\naccount of their diminutive size. The opossums are of peculiar interest\r\nowing to the fact that they are the only representatives of the\r\nmarsupials now living outside of Australia. Fossil species occur,\r\nhowever, in the Tertiary rock of Europe, so that the American forms\r\ncannot be considered as indicating a recent land connection between this\r\ncontinent and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe porcupines are also representative of the New World fauna, although\r\nnot strictly confined to it, and belong mostly in the northern\r\ncontinent. The Canadian porcupine is found throughout nearly the entire\r\nforested portion of the boreal region and extends as far south as the\r\nMiddle Atlantic States, and an allied species, but of larger size,\r\ninhabits a portion of the same region and extends to the Pacific\r\nmountains and occurs in Alaska.\r\n\r\nThe racoons are strictly American and inhabit both continents. They are\r\ncommon in the forests of Central America and Mexico, and extend as far\r\nnorth as central Canada.\r\n\r\nOf the several families of smaller and less well-known mammals peculiar\r\nto this continent, mention may be made of the pouched rats of\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nAll of the animals to which attention has thus far been directed are now\r\nliving; should one attempt to describe the great number of fossil forms\r\nwhose bones have been discovered in the rocks, the menagerie would be\r\nvastly enlarged, and many exceedingly strange species, genera, families,\r\nand even larger divisions of the animal kingdom, added to the extended\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE BIRDS\r\n\r\nWhen one attempts to write an account of the birds of North America, the\r\nheavens seem darkened with such a multitude of varied and beautiful\r\nforms and the air filled with such a discordant clamour mingled with the\r\nsweetest of music that failure to convey an adequate idea of the\r\ncountless numbers and diversity of the feathered throng within the\r\ncompass of a few pages must be recognised from the start.\r\n\r\nThe important place held by the birds of North America in the avifauna\r\nof the world, may perhaps be best indicated by noting first of all what\r\norders and families are without representatives among them.\r\n\r\nThe orders under which the birds of the world are arranged in the scheme\r\nof classification adopted by Wallace in his great work on the\r\ngeographical distribution of animals are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CLASS--AVES\r\n\r\n ORDERS.

Passeres     Includes the greater number of the smaller birds, such\r\n                   as kingbirds, flycatchers, larks, jays, crows,\r\n                   blackbirds, finches, sparrows, warblers, chickadees,\r\n                   swallows, thrushes, etc., numbering in North America\r\n                   some 328 species and many subspecies.\r\n\r\n 2. Picariae      Woodpeckers, cuckoos, toucans, kingfishers, swifts,\r\n                   goat-suckers, humming-birds, etc.\r\n\r\n 3. Psittaci     Parrots only.\r\n\r\n 4. Columbae      Pigeons and the dodo.\r\n\r\n 5. Gallinae      Grouse, pheasants, quail, jungle-fowl, turkeys,\r\n                   guinea-fowl, etc.\r\n\r\n 6. Opisthocomi  The hoazin of Guiana and Brazil only.\r\n\r\n 7. Accipitres   Eagles, owls, vultures, hawks, buzzards, falcons, etc.\r\n\r\n 8. Grallae       Rails, snipes, plovers, cranes, herons, storks,\r\n                   flamingoes, etc.\r\n\r\n 9. Anseres      Ducks, geese, gulls, petrels, pelicans, penguins,\r\n                   loons, auks, etc.\r\n\r\n 10. Struthiones Ostrich, rhea, cassowaries, emeus, apteryx.\r\n\r\nOf these ten orders, all but two are abundantly represented in North\r\nAmerica. The missing orders include the ostrich-like birds, of which the\r\nonly species in the New World is the rhea, of the southern portion of\r\nSouth America, and the peculiar hoazin, represented by a single\r\nspecies found in Guiana and Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe eight orders under which the birds of North America have been\r\narranged (other classifications, however, have been adopted by various\r\nnaturalists) have again been subdivided into families, genera, species,\r\netc. According to Wallace's summary, the 8 orders referred to contain\r\n124 families, of which 75 are not represented in North America to the\r\nnorth of the lowlands of Mexico, while 47 families are present. Of these\r\n47 families, 25 are essentially of world-wide distribution, and only 1,\r\ncontaining a single species, a small wren-like bird of the genus\r\n_Chamaea_, found in California, is peculiar to the fauna of the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nAs the North American continent under the arrangement adopted for the\r\nseries of books of which the one in hand forms a part, is considered as\r\nincluding the West Indies, Mexico, and Central America, the above\r\nsummary does not represent its entire bird fauna, but presents, perhaps,\r\nthe best general idea of it that is at present attainable. To include\r\nthe birds of the tropical portion of the continent would add greatly to\r\nthe number of species, but I believe not materially to the number of\r\nfamilies and orders, as given above.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the distribution of the land birds of North America to the\r\nnorth of Mexico, but including lower California, J. A. Allen places the\r\ntotal number of genera, as given in the check-list of the American\r\nOrnithologists' Union, at 181. Of these, 55, or 30 per cent, are\r\ncircumpolar or otherwise wide-ranging Old World forms; 126 genera, or 70\r\nper cent, are American, of which 35, or 28 per cent, are essentially\r\ntropical, leaving 91 genera, or about 50 per cent, as distinctly North\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nThe number of species in the avifauna of the continent, according to the\r\nlatest check-list published by the American Ornithologists' Union\r\n(1895), is 768, together with a large number of subspecies. If the\r\ntropical portion of the continent were included, this number would be\r\ngreatly increased and possibly doubled.\r\n\r\nA further generalization has been advanced by Allen, who states that in\r\nthe arctic portion of the continent the number of genera of birds\r\npresent during the breeding season is 65, of which only 5 are\r\nexclusively American. In the cold temperate belt 120 genera are\r\nrepresented, of which 98 are circumpolar and 22 American. In the warm\r\ntemperate belt 95 genera occur which do not range into the cold\r\ntemperate belt, and of these only 12 are Old World forms, while 83 are\r\nexclusively American, and in addition 60 genera are common to both the\r\ncold and the warm temperate zone, of which 46 are represented in the\r\nfauna of the Old World, while 14 are American. This gives 155 genera for\r\nthe warm temperate zone, of which 58 are Old World and 97 exclusively\r\nAmerican. There are besides 50 essentially tropical genera which extend\r\ninto the warm temperate zone, of which 43 are American and 7\r\ntropicopolitan. The avifauna of the warm temperate zone thus contains a\r\ntotal of 205 genera.\r\n\r\nThe above enumeration indicates the rapid increase in the variety of\r\nbird life met with as one travels from the arctic to the Gulf coast of\r\nthe continent, and in this connection it is to be remembered that the\r\nland contracts in breadth towards the south. In number of individuals,\r\nhowever, it is doubtful if there are less per square mile at the north\r\nthan at the south during the breeding season.\r\n\r\nThere is a decrease in the number of Old World forms inhabiting North\r\nAmerica from north to south. A similar decrease in mammalian species\r\ncommon to America and Eurasia has previously been referred to, and the\r\nsame explanation applies in each case, namely, the near approach of the\r\nland areas of the Old and the New World at the north, and the actual\r\nunion of the two continents in late geological time.\r\n\r\nAs has been shown by Allen, the species of birds of the temperate and\r\nboreal zones of North America were derived in part from the Old World,\r\nin part from types almost universally distributed throughout the warmer\r\nlatitudes, and in part from tropical America, but to a marked extent the\r\nspecies present developed where they are now found. This\r\ngeneralization is in harmony with the geographical relations of the\r\ncontinent to other land areas, and with the fundamental principles of\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\n_Migrations._--Among the many facts of interest to the geographer in\r\nconnection with the bird life, none present a more fascinating field for\r\nstudy than the annual migrations in which a very large number of the\r\nspecies participate.\r\n\r\nAs one travels northward from Mexico or the Gulf States, the number of\r\nspecies of birds which remain in essentially the same area throughout\r\nthe year, or the _residents_ as they are termed, becomes less and less.\r\nIn New England and about the southern shores of the Great Lakes there\r\nare about 30 species which remain all winter and may justly claim to be\r\ncitizens. Besides these, there are several visitors that come from the\r\nnorth and belong to the vast army of migrants, but which are contented\r\nwith a comparatively small change of position during the periods of\r\ngreatest cold or heaviest snow. In the far north the number of residents\r\nis still more restricted. On the tundras fringing the arctic coast even\r\nthe snow-owls, snow-buntings, and the ptarmigans, the hardiest of birds,\r\nmove southward during the winter to the shelter of the subarctic forest,\r\nand bird life on the vast frozen morasses is practically, if not\r\nabsolutely, wanting.\r\n\r\nThe millions of birds that journey southward each fall begin their\r\nreturn migrations at the first promise of spring. Even during unusually\r\nmild spells of weather in winter, temporary northward movements occur.\r\nThe migratory birds are actuated by such a strong desire to regain their\r\nnesting places and summer homes that they embrace every opportunity to\r\njourney towards them, and not infrequently suffer severely for the risks\r\nthey take. In some instances species which have begun their northward\r\nflight too soon are killed by thousands owing to a return of severely\r\ncold weather or die for lack of food.\r\n\r\nThe first definite northward migration in the southern portion of the\r\nMississippi Valley begins during exceptionally favourable years as early\r\nas the end of January, but the great movement of the feathered\r\nhosts is not usually at its height before the middle of March or the\r\nfirst of April. In New England the current of migration begins between\r\nthe middle of February and the first of March, and increases in strength\r\nuntil the middle of May, when it is at its height, and then rapidly\r\ndeclines and is practically over by the beginning of June. In the far\r\nnorth, the first arrival from the southward, and that a species which\r\ndoes not make a long annual journey, usually appears early in April. At\r\nPoint Barrow, the most northern portion of Alaska, as was observed by\r\nJohn Murdock in 1882 and 1883, the first harbinger of spring was a\r\nsnow-bunting, which arrived the first year on April 9th. The\r\nnorthward-flowing tide of bird life ends early in July in the region of\r\nthe Yukon, and by the middle of that month the vast flocks have been\r\nseparated and the many mates have found their nesting places. The time\r\ntaken for the general movement is thus in the neighbourhood of four\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThe northward flight of the birds is seldom, if ever, one continuous\r\njourney, but like many other movements in nature, progresses by\r\npulsations. Well-defined \"bird-waves\" have been recognised especially in\r\nthe Mississippi Valley. The direct or immediate cause of the starting of\r\nthese waves of life is the coming of a wave of heat. Secondary or\r\nmodifying conditions are furnished by strength and direction of the\r\nwind, cloudiness, rain, etc. As the weather in spring-time is fickle,\r\nand its variations not the same for any two consecutive years, so the\r\ngathering of the birds into flocks and their northward flights vary,\r\nalthough for a term of years the arrival of a given species at a\r\nparticular station does not depart far from a mean date. With the\r\nnorthward sweep of the waves of bird life over the temperate and boreal\r\nportions of the continent comes the awakening of plant life, but the\r\nbirds, to a marked extent, precede the unfolding of the flowers. This\r\nmarvellous renewal of the life of the land after the long cold winter\r\nmakes the budding and nesting spring-time the most joyous portion of the\r\nyear, and one which exerts a marked effect on human thought and\r\nactivities. The spring-time awakening in all nature is like a\r\nresurrection, and has apparently exerted an influence on the religions\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nThe bird-waves referred to above are characterized at the start by the\r\npresence of great numbers of a single species, but as they progress,\r\nscattering occurs, and at the time of the greatest movements in the\r\nnorthern portion of the United States a large number of species\r\nfrequently arrive at a given locality in a single night. At sunset the\r\ngroves may be nearly tenantless and silent, while at sunrise they are\r\nalive with the flitting of wings of many colours, and the air pulsates\r\nwith many different songs.\r\n\r\nJudging from extended observations on migrations made in the Mississippi\r\nValley, the definite waves of bird life which sweep northward with the\r\nspring-tide of temperature are in some instances 100 or 200 miles long\r\nand have a breadth of perhaps a score of miles. The distance between the\r\nwaves varies with variations in the weather and perhaps other causes,\r\nand as they progress they apparently become less definite and at the\r\nnorth have yet to be recognised.\r\n\r\nThe migrations of the birds are performed principally at night. In the\r\nnorthern part of the United States during the hours of darkness in early\r\nspring, even when cloudiness prevails or the land is veiled in mist, the\r\nvoices of geese may frequently be heard overhead, proving that unseen\r\nflocks are then winging their way northward. About the lighthouses along\r\nthe coast and on the shores of the Great Lakes, when migration is in\r\nprogress, dead birds are frequently found in considerable numbers and of\r\nvarious species. In these cases the birds are evidently attracted by the\r\nlights and killed on striking the windows that protect them. This occurs\r\nparticularly on stormy or cloudy nights, when the birds fly low. Several\r\nof the larger species of birds, as the geese, ducks, cranes, etc., which\r\nare strong of wing, make long flights without resting. In many instances\r\na single stage in a journey may include 500 or 600 miles. Most of the\r\nsmaller birds, however, fly comparatively short distances between the\r\npauses made for rest and food.\r\n\r\nA species on reaching the northern portion of the route over which it\r\nusually migrates scatters, and the individuals mate, nests are built,\r\nand young reared. At the approach of cold weather reassemblage occurs,\r\nfrequently great flocks being formed, and the southern movement begins.\r\nThe southward migration is less conspicuous in most instances than the\r\nmovement _en masse_ of the birds in the spring, and so far as now seems\r\nto be recognised is not divided into definite waves.\r\n\r\nWhile the winter habitat of most birds in the temperate and boreal\r\nportions of the continent is to the south of their summer homes, the\r\nannual migration is not in all cases great in amount. Some species move\r\nonly a few hundred, or possibly a few score, miles. Even the winter\r\nresidents make short migrations, dependent on weather conditions. The\r\ngreater part of the migratory birds, however, pass the winter in the\r\nGulf States, Mexico, the West Indies, and Central and South America. In\r\nsome cases they go well to the south of the equator. The annual flight\r\ngoing and coming measured in a straight line, between the nesting place\r\nand the winter home, cannot be less in many instances than from 8,000 to\r\n10,000 or 12,000 miles. An interesting fact in this connection is that\r\ncertain species follow definite routes. The region moved over annually,\r\nif marked on a map, would resemble two open or partially opened fans,\r\nwith their handles pointing towards each other and connected by a narrow\r\nband.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the annual migrations of birds have received much study\r\nand been the subject of much speculation. The general consensus of\r\nopinion in this connection seems to be that the birds are controlled\r\nlargely by what we in our ignorance term instinct. The true beginning of\r\nthe migration seems to be in the fall, when the birds are driven from\r\ntheir homes by cold or, perhaps more accurately in most cases, by\r\nscarcity of food. This, however, is not the whole story, since many\r\nspecies start southward before cold weather approaches and while food is\r\nyet abundant. Then, too, crippled individuals have been known to survive\r\nthe winter in regions from which their summer companions have\r\ndeparted. Instinct, therefore, plays a part in even the fall migration,\r\nwhere at first glance sufficient physical reasons may seemingly be\r\nclaimed for it. During the spring migration the birds are moved by a\r\nstrong impulse to regain their breeding-grounds. Each species seems to\r\nhave adapted itself to certain conditions of temperature, food, etc.,\r\nthrough long ages of development, and acquired a subtle faculty of\r\nregaining the environment to which it is best adapted, as soon as the\r\nadverse conditions that caused it to leave its home are ameliorated. How\r\na particular bird is enabled to return to the nest it built the year\r\nprevious is not known. The study of the homing instinct of pigeons\r\nassists in this direction, however, and suggests that birds are endowed\r\nwith something answering to a sixth sense--that is, a sense of direction\r\nor of orientation.\r\n\r\n_Spring-time Music._--The northward-flowing tide of life each spring\r\nbrings to the temperate zone of North America a marvellous change not\r\nonly in colour and movements, but in sound. This is the season of bird\r\ncourtship and more than usual happiness among the feathered millions.\r\nFrom shore to shore of the continent a chorus more seductive than\r\nsirens' songs pulsates on the breezes.\r\n\r\nThe winter is characteristically a season of silence. The sounds heard\r\nat a distance from human habitations are mainly those produced by\r\ninanimate nature. The wind causes varied discords amid the bare branches\r\nof the deciduous trees or sings weird melodies in the pines. Strange\r\nmuffled roars come from the frozen lakes, as the ice contracts and\r\nbreaks during periods of excessive cold. The frost in tree trunks causes\r\nsharp explosions. The ice-covered streams are still except where\r\ncataracts interrupt their even flow. In the profound silence of a calm\r\nwinter night the distant dismal howl of a wolf, the cry of an owl, or\r\nthe bark of a fox alone reminds one that life still continues, but these\r\nanimate sounds are far more frequently absent than present. With the\r\ncoming of the spring there is a marvellous awakening and unfolding. The\r\nbrooks, swollen to overflowing by the melting of the snow, make\r\nmusic as they run. The northward flight of the birds brings to every\r\ngrove a chorus of song. A host of batrachians and reptiles bestir\r\nthemselves after a long winter sleep and vociferously proclaim their\r\npresence. The insect world, with its unnumbered legions, takes wing. The\r\nair vibrates with millions of voices. The trees put forth their leaves,\r\neach a harp-string which responds to the touch of the fingers of the\r\nwind. The organ-notes of the thunder again startle the hibernating\r\nechoes. As the winter is the silent season, so the spring is the time of\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nOne of the most charming of the many phases of nature's concert season\r\nis the matin songs of the birds. Ere the eastern sky along the New\r\nEngland coast becomes roseate with the first blush of morn, the twitter\r\nof birds may be heard amid the shadowy branches of the trees. Soon a\r\nthrush or a warbler awakens in full song, and is followed by a host of\r\nother voices, until the air pulsates with music. As the sun rises and\r\nhis first level rays reveal the varied tints of the tree tops, the\r\nmany-voiced chorus passes the height of its ecstasy and the music\r\ngradually subsides. But the glad tidings of the coming of the day are\r\npassed westward from grove to grove and from meadow to meadow, and a\r\nwave of song sweeps on ahead of the wave of light, induced by its\r\ncoming. The song-wave spreads to the north and south and flows steadily\r\nwestward over the forest-covered mountains, across the great central\r\nbasin of the continent, breaking on the treeless plateaus into many\r\nstreams which follow the grove-fringed rivers, passes through the\r\ndepressions in the Rocky Mountains, and although weakened in the arid\r\nvalleys beyond, is not checked. The larks there listen for its coming\r\nand pass the joyful message westward. The timid dwellers in the great\r\nforests of Oregon awaken at the magic sound and the lofty tree tops are\r\nmade to thrill with the voices of unseen choirs while it is yet night in\r\nthe silent aisles below. The onward rush of sound is not reflected or\r\nturned back by the lofty Cascades, but flows through their passes and\r\nonly ceases when the sea-birds of the Pacific renew a note that\r\nwas dropped on the distant Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\nOne of the most fascinating incidents in the life of the explorer in his\r\nlonely camps in the great forests or amid the solemn mountains is the\r\ncoming of the wave of song in the spring and early summer-time which\r\nprecedes and accompanies the rising of the sun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fascination of the field of study touched upon in this chapter\r\ninvites an attempt to present an account of some of the more\r\ncharacteristic birds of North America, and to endeavour to convey to the\r\nreader some idea of the varied reptilian, fish, and invertebrate life of\r\nthe continent, but the limitations of space prohibit such a review. Even\r\nthe great problems dealing with the intimate relation that exists\r\nbetween geographical conditions and the distribution of animals cannot\r\nbe given more attention than the suggestions already offered.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LITERATURE\r\n\r\n  ALLEN, J.

Yesterday, we may say for the sake of emphasis, there were\r\ndifferences from what exists to-day in each of these great groups of\r\nfacts. That is, changes are everywhere in progress. With the recognition\r\nof this idea comes logically the conclusion that similar changes must\r\nhave taken place in the past, and that the geography of the earth's\r\nsurface, and its flora and fauna, at no very distant time must have been\r\nmarkedly different from what they are to-day. To test this hypothesis\r\nthe geologist studies the records preserved in the rocks in much the\r\nsame manner that the historian searches the papyri or the monuments of\r\nEgypt to discover what changes in the affairs of men have occurred since\r\nthe days of the Pharaohs. The changes referred to are not essentially\r\ndifferent from those now in progress, but in reality the two are parts\r\nof a single series. For a very long time there have been continents and\r\noceans, lakes and rivers, and the land has been diversified by mountains\r\nand hills, plains and valleys, in the same general way as at the present\r\ntime. When once the idea is grasped that we are living in a geological\r\nage, and that there is no break between the present and the past, it is\r\nevident that the history of the past can be interpreted by means of the\r\nresults produced by known causes. Familiar formulas which express this\r\nidea are: \"The present is the key to the past\"; \"Geography is the\r\ngeology of to-day,\" etc. The forces or agencies which are now modifying\r\nthe earth's surface, such as the rending of rocks by changes of\r\ntemperature and the action of frost, erosion and deposition by streams,\r\nthe dash of ocean waves against the land, volcanic eruption, the\r\nchemical action of organic acids, movements producing upheaval and\r\nsubsidence, etc., have been in action for geological eras, but their\r\nintensity has varied from time to time and from place to place.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE GROWTH OF THE CONTINENT\r\n\r\nThe geological history of North America is, in general, the same as that\r\nof other continents, but claims attention in certain particulars,\r\nlargely for the reason that with the exception of Europe it has been\r\nstudied more thoroughly than any other comparable land area. In Europe,\r\nthroughout much of geological time, there have been numerous islands,\r\nand as a large portion of the records of past changes which have been\r\npresented were formed in the ocean, the results are complex. But in\r\nNorth America there has been a comparatively steady growth from one main\r\ncontinental centre or nucleus, and the records of the principal changes\r\nthat have occurred are, to a greater degree, simple. Not only in the\r\nmajor features of the relief of the continent, as already described, but\r\nin its growth and geological history, it is, so far as can be judged\r\nfrom the present state of our knowledge of the various land areas, the\r\nmost typical of all the continents.\r\n\r\nChanges in the outlines and area of a continent are brought about\r\nprincipally by movements of elevation or depression in the earth's\r\ncrust. Of less importance is the erosion of the margin of the land by\r\nwaves and currents and the deposition of material brought from the land\r\nby streams, together with the spits, bars, and embankments made by waves\r\nand currents. By these and other and less conspicuous processes the\r\nshape of North America has undergone numerous changes in outline and is\r\nstill being modified.\r\n\r\nGeneral maps have been prepared by J. D. Dana and others, showing the\r\noutlines of North America at various stages in the course of its\r\ndevelopment, and from a series of such maps recently compiled by D. C.\r\nSchaffner those here reproduced (Fig. 33) have been selected to\r\nillustrate the growth of the continent. As has been shown by various\r\ngeologists, the outlines of the present continents and ocean-basins had\r\ntheir major features determined at a very early stage in the history of\r\nthe earth, and at a time preceding the existence of the oldest known\r\nsedimentary rocks. At the close of the Archean, the earliest geological\r\nera now recognised, and, so far as has been determined, before life\r\nexisted on the earth, the principal nucleus of North America was a land\r\nmass some 2,000,000 square miles in area, situated mainly in what is now\r\nthe eastern half of Canada, from which there was a southward\r\nprolongation represented by the Adirondack hills of New York (Fig. 33,\r\nA).\r\n\r\nThe rocks forming this earliest known land in the Western Hemisphere\r\nconsist of crystalline schists, gneisses, and granite, which are\r\nconsidered by some geologists at least as having resulted from the\r\nmetamorphism of sedimentary beds. Penetrating and intimately\r\nintermingled with these greatly altered rocks, some of them perhaps\r\nmetamorphosed lavas and allied terranes, are many rocks that were forced\r\nupward from deep in the earth into fissures in a molten condition and\r\nhave since cooled and crystallized. More than one epoch of metamorphism\r\nhas perhaps occurred, and the entire record now accessible is\r\nexceedingly complicated.\r\n\r\nThe physical conditions at the earth's surface at the close of the\r\nArchean period, as may reasonably be inferred, were not essentially\r\ndifferent from what they are now. The land areas were eroded by streams,\r\nand the _debris_ carried to the sea and deposited, the coarser near\r\nshore and the finer farther seaward. Upward movements in the earth's\r\ncrust in various places subsequently laid bare a portion of the\r\nsea-floor adjacent to the former land, and the continent was enlarged.\r\nThe outline of the land as it existed previous to the upheaval which\r\nexposed this portion of the ocean's bottom would be defined by the\r\nlandward margin of the material deposited. The exposed sediments\r\nwould be coarsest near the former coast-line and become finer and finer\r\nseaward from it, and the fossils contained in the consolidated sands and\r\nclays would also supply evidence bearing on the origin of the rocks. It\r\nis by such interpretation of the ancient records in the light of what is\r\nnow taking place that the geologist is enabled to map approximately the\r\noutline of North America at several stages in its growth in the manner\r\nshown on the series of maps here presented. Information in this\r\nconnection, however, concerning both the northern and southern portions\r\nof the continent is too meagre at present to be largely utilized in\r\nthese outline sketches.[5]\r\n\r\n[5] The relations of the eras referred to on these maps and the\r\npositions they occupy on the geological time-scale are shown a few pages\r\nlater on a chart of the geological history of North America.\r\n\r\nThe next system thus far recognised, following the Archean, is the\r\nAlgonkian, at the close of whose deposition some additions had been made\r\nto the Archean or pre-Algonkian land. Succeeding the Algonkian system\r\ncome, in succession, the Cambrian, Ordovician, and Silurian systems. At\r\nthe close of the Silurian there was a decided increase in the size of\r\nthe main nucleus of the continent. Owing principally to an excess of\r\nelevation over subsidence in the portion of the earth's crust beneath\r\nthe northeastern part of the region now occupied by the United States,\r\nportions of the sediments deposited previous to the close of the\r\nSilurian were upraised and important additions made to the extent of the\r\nland southward from the Archean area of Canada. This \"Appalachian\r\npeninsula\" would be conspicuous in a map representing the outline of the\r\ncontinent at the close of the Silurian. The eastern margin of the\r\ngrowing continent was then well to the eastward of its present position,\r\nbut how far beyond the present coast we have no means of determining.\r\nAlthough at the close of the Silurian the continent had greatly\r\nincreased in area over that of the nucleus at the close of the Archean,\r\nit bore but little resemblance to its present form. It is worthy\r\nof note, however, that with the exception of the eastward extension of\r\nthe land at the time referred to, the growth had been within the present\r\ncontinental outline.\r\n\r\nA later stage in the growth of the continent is shown in Fig. 33, B,\r\nwhen its eastern margin had much of its present general outline and the\r\nAppalachian Mountains were in their prime. The time indicated is at the\r\nclose of the Paleozoic era, and after the great coal-fields extending\r\nfrom Pennsylvania southward to Alabama and westward to beyond the\r\nMississippi were formed. The eastern half of the continent was\r\napproximately completed at the time just referred to, and is older than\r\nthe western half.\r\n\r\nDuring the Cretaceous period great changes took place in the geography\r\nof the still growing continent, as may be seen by the map illustrating\r\nthat period. The conspicuous features in the geography are the submerged\r\nAtlantic and Gulf borders, and the presence of a broad belt of ocean\r\nwater in the continental basin which reached from the then much expanded\r\nGulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean, and divided the land into an eastern\r\nand a western continental island.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Cretaceous period came the Tertiary period, during which\r\nthe continent assumed very nearly its present outline. During this\r\nperiod, however, as is indicated in Fig. 33, D, the Atlantic border of\r\nthe United States from New England southward and a wide area about the\r\nGulf of Mexico, were submerged and had deep layers of sediment deposited\r\non them. During the Tertiary, bodies of fresh water became for the first\r\ntime a conspicuous feature on the land, and large lakes and broad\r\nsilt-depositing rivers existed particularly in the Pacific mountain\r\nregion of the United States, and at its close the continent was\r\npractically completed as we now know it, but several important\r\noscillations, particularly at the north, have since occurred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Maps showing the growth of the North American\r\ncontinent.]\r\n\r\nWith the growth of the continent, briefly outlined above, came greater\r\nand greater diversity in its relief, due principally to the\r\nupraising of various mountains in a somewhat orderly succession from\r\neast to west.\r\n\r\nThe oldest mountains on the continent are the Laurentian Highlands of\r\neastern Canada. Although the region referred to--the one mentioned above\r\nas being composed of Archean crystalline rocks--is not now of sufficient\r\nelevation or ruggedness to be termed mountainous, it shows in the nature\r\nand structure of its rocks that deep erosion has taken place. The\r\ninference is that truly great mountains have been removed, but the\r\nevidence may also sustain the interpretation that slow upheaval has been\r\naccompanied by erosion, and that at no time was the land conspicuously\r\nelevated.\r\n\r\nNext in age after the Laurentian Highlands come the mountains of New\r\nEngland and the maritime province of Canada, which were upraised at the\r\nclose of the Silurian period. The next great step was the crumpling into\r\nfolds and upheaval of the rocks in the Appalachian region at the close\r\nof the Paleozoic era. The Park and Stony Mountains were upraised at the\r\nclose of the Mesozoic era, and later came the Sierra Nevada and\r\nCascades, followed by the Coast Ranges. Youngest of all, and in part for\r\nthat reason the boldest and most lofty, are the magnificent mountains of\r\nsouthern Alaska, with a host of sublime peaks, like Mounts Fairweather,\r\nLogan, St. Elias, and perhaps McKinley. The last-named and highest peak\r\nof all, however, may be of volcanic origin.\r\n\r\nIn the above list showing the progressive westward movement of the birth\r\nof mountain systems, account is taken only of the elevations produced by\r\nupheaval. The mountains due to volcanic eruptions, which are still\r\nconspicuous, are all young, in comparison with the mountains situated to\r\nthe eastward of the Sierra Nevada. The majestic cones of the\r\nnorthwestern portion of the United States, of which Mounts Shasta, Hood,\r\nAdams, Rainier, Baker, etc., are the most glorious, are of Tertiary or\r\nlater age. The same is true, so far as known, of the still more lofty\r\nvolcanoes in Mexico. The \"pine-tree\" forms of steam rising from the\r\nvolcanoes of the Caribbees, Central America, southern Mexico, and\r\nsouthwestern Alaska, proclaim the recency of the birth of the frequently\r\nmagnificent craters built of rocks that were once molten, from which\r\nthey emerge.\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE ROCKS OF WHICH THE CONTINENT IS COMPOSED\r\n\r\nThe rocks of which North America is built belong to three classes, which\r\nare world-wide in their distribution. These are: First, rocks produced\r\nby the cooling and crystallizing of formerly molten magmas; second,\r\nthose deposited by water; and third, those which previously belonged to\r\neither of the two classes just referred to, but have been recrystallized\r\nand so greatly changed that their preceding condition is no longer\r\nclearly recognisable.\r\n\r\nThese three classes or subkingdoms, as perhaps they might be termed from\r\nanalogy with systems of biological classifications, are in technical\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n     1. _Igneous rocks_, such as the lava of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\n     2. _Sedimentary rocks_, such as sandstone, shale, limestone,\r\n     coal, etc.\r\n\r\n     3. _Metamorphic rocks_, such as gneiss, schist, some granites,\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\nThese major divisions are based principally on mode of origin, but do\r\nnot indicate relative age. While theoretically at least, and in a\r\ngeneral way, the rocks of these three great classes came into existence\r\non the earth in the order named, it is convenient to consider first\r\nthose of sedimentary origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.--Leading geological features.]\r\n\r\n_The Sedimentary Rocks_ (Plate IV).--Whenever land exists or the waves\r\nand currents of the ocean come in contact with the rocks denudation\r\noccurs. That is, the rocks are broken through the action of mechanical\r\nor chemical agencies, such as the friction of the gravel and sand swept\r\nalong by streams, the solvent power of water, etc., and the fragments\r\nthus produced are removed principally through the action of flowing\r\nwater and deposited. Resulting from this general process of rock decay\r\nand disintegration, combined with transportation and deposition,\r\nthere result mechanically formed sedimentary beds, such as shale,\r\nsandstone, conglomerate, etc.; chemically formed sedimentary beds, such\r\nas the deposits of springs, the saline precipitates from inclosed lakes,\r\netc.; and organically formed sedimentary beds, as, for example, peat,\r\ncoal, and limestone.\r\n\r\nSince the first appearance of land in the region now occupied by North\r\nAmerica, sedimentary rocks have been in process of formation, and in\r\nthis way the growth of the continent, with the aid of movements in the\r\nearth's crust, has been produced.\r\n\r\nThe superficial extent of the sedimentary beds in North America is very\r\ngreat, as is indicated on the map referred to above. By far the larger\r\nportion of the surface of the continent is underlain by them. Their\r\nthickness varies from place to place, but probably reaches a maximum in\r\nthe Appalachian region, where a depth of some 40,000 feet has been\r\nmeasured. Throughout the continental basin their depth is in general\r\nfrom 3,000 to 4,000 feet. In the Pacific mountains their thickness\r\nembraces tens of thousands of feet, and the same is true in Mexico,\r\nCuba, and Jamaica. These sedimentary rocks contain fossils which, with\r\ncomparatively few exceptions, show that they were deposited in the\r\nocean; thus sustaining in an important manner the conclusion already\r\npresented in reference to the growth of the continent.\r\n\r\nGreat as is the area of the sedimentary beds at the present time, it\r\ndoes not show the entire extent to which what is now land has at some\r\ntime been submerged beneath the sea. In certain broad regions,\r\nsedimentary beds which formerly existed have been removed by erosion; in\r\nother extensive areas they are covered by volcanic rocks, and in still\r\nother portions of the continent, embracing thousands of square miles,\r\nthey have been metamorphosed and their original characteristics\r\nobliterated.\r\n\r\nThe system of classification of the sedimentary beds that has been\r\nadopted, as is well known, is based on the relative age of the\r\nformations, determined primarily by the occurrence of one formation\r\nabove another, in regions where but moderate disturbances in\r\nposition have occurred. Many of the stratified rocks contain\r\nfossils--that is, records of the life of the time they were deposited,\r\nand after the order of succession of a large number of formations has\r\nbeen ascertained, the life records they contain may be used as a means\r\nof determining the age of a newly discovered terrane.\r\n\r\nBy grouping the information obtained from the study of the vertical\r\nsequence of the formations in many regions, and also the records of life\r\ncontained in them, a composite geological column has been constructed\r\nwhich shows the relative age of all known formations. The larger\r\ndivisions of such a scheme of classification are world-wide in their\r\napplication, but the smaller divisions are usually of restricted\r\ngeographical extent.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of classification of general application in North America is\r\nshown in the chart on page 308. The arrangement is in order of age, the\r\noldest formation being at the bottom. There is some lack of uniformity\r\namong American geologists as to certain of the terms used, more\r\nespecially in the lower portion of the column, and in part the scheme is\r\nprovisional, but in general it may be taken as expressing the progress\r\nmade in the study of the geology of North America up to the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe names of the larger divisions in this scheme of classification, or\r\nthose designating the groups and systems and the eras and periods, have\r\nfor the most part been adopted from European geologists. Two important\r\nones, however--namely, Archean and Algonkian--are of American birth.\r\n\r\nWhile this scheme of classification is based on the succession of\r\nsedimentary beds, igneous and metamorphic rocks have a place in it,\r\nproviding their age can be determined.\r\n\r\nThe Archean period includes the time previous to the deposition of the\r\noldest known sedimentary beds, and its lower limit is as yet undefined.\r\nThe Archean system, or the rocks formed during the Archean period, are\r\nwithout known fossils, and consist largely of gneisses and foliated\r\nschists, which are metamorphosed sedimentary or igneous terranes,\r\ntogether with various eruptives. The typical area where these rocks are\r\nexposed at the surface is in the Laurentian Highlands of eastern Canada,\r\nthe main Archean nucleus of the continent, but rocks of the same age and\r\nsame general character occur in several of the mountain systems of both\r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific cordilleras, and underlie the sedimentary beds\r\nthroughout a large part of the Continental basin. The Archean system was\r\nnamed by J. D. Dana, and divided into two portions, namely, the\r\nLaurentian below and the Huronian above. More recent studies, especially\r\nby C. R. Van Hise, have shown the necessity of removing from the system\r\nmany of the terranes formerly referred to it, and of placing them in the\r\nAlgonkian. The Archean as it remains after this adjustment is termed by\r\nVan Hise the _Basement Complex_. This term, although thus far not\r\ngenerally adopted, has much to commend it, since the terranes designated\r\nby it are highly complex, and may perhaps be ultimately subdivided into\r\ntwo or more systems, and besides occupy a basal position lower than any\r\nknown sedimentary formation that has escaped metamorphism.\r\n\r\n      _Outline Chart of the Geological History of North America_\r\n\r\n +----------------------------------------+-----------+-----------------+\r\n |                         Rock-Scale. -->|   Group.  |   System.       |\r\n |                         Time-Scale. -->|    Era.   |   Period.       |\r\n +------------+------------+--------------+-----------+-----------------+\r\n |Zoic time:  |  Time of   |   Time of    |Psychozoic.|Human.           |\r\n |embracing   |  Mammals.  |  Palms and   +-----------+-----------------+\r\n |the history +------------+ Angiosperms. |           |Pleistocene.     |\r\n |of the      |            +--------------+Cenozoic.  +-----------------+\r\n |earth since |            |              |           |Tertiary.        |\r\n |the         |  Time of   |              +-----------+-----------------+\r\n |appearance  | Reptiles.  |   Time of    |           |Cretaceous.      |\r\n |of life.    |            |   Cycads.    |Mesozoic.  +-----------------+\r\n |            +------------+--------------+           |Jura-Trias.      |\r\n |            |  Time of   |              +-----------+-----------------+\r\n |            |Amphibians. |   Time of    |           |Carboniferous.   |\r\n |            |            |   Acrogens   |           +-----------------+\r\n |            +------------+(Ferns, club- |           |Devonian.        |\r\n |            |  Time of   |mosses, etc.).|           +-----------------+\r\n |            |  Fishes.   |              |Paleozoic. |Silurian.        |\r\n |            +------------+              |           +-----------------+\r\n |            |            +--------------+           |Ordovician.      |\r\n |            |  Time of   |              |           +-----------------+\r\n |            |Molluscs and|              |           |Cambrian.        |\r\n |            |Crustaceans.|              +-----------+-----------------+\r\n |            |            |   Time of    |           |Algonkian.       |\r\n |            +------------+    Algae.     |           +-----------------+\r\n |            |            |              |Eozoic.    |(As yet unknown  |\r\n |            |  Time of   |              |           |pre-Algonkian    |\r\n |            | Protozoa?  |              |           |sediments.)      |\r\n +------------+------------+--------------+-----------+-----------------+\r\n |Azoic time: preceding the dawn of life. |Azoic.     |Archean or       |\r\n |                                        |           |Basement Complex.|\r\n +----------------------------------------+-----------+-----------------+\r\n |                                         Solid Earth.                 |\r\n |            Prehistoric                  Molten Earth.                |\r\n |                                         Gaseous Earth.               |\r\n +----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe Algonkian series embraces a great thickness of sedimentary beds, in\r\npart metamorphosed, which in certain localities rest unconformably on\r\nthe eroded surface of the Basement Complex and in places are overlain\r\nunconformably by Cambrian rocks. Both the upper and lower contacts,\r\nhowever, in certain localities, have been rendered obscure by\r\nmetamorphism. The system derives its name from a tribe of Indians that\r\ninhabited the region about the shores of Lake Superior, where it is well\r\ndeveloped. The Algonkian terranes are exposed in the Grand Canyon of the\r\nColorado, in the Wasatch and Uintah Mountains, the Black Hills of\r\nDakota, about the southern shore of Lake Superior, and in many parts of\r\neastern Canada, as well as in several other localities. The oldest known\r\nfossils occur in these rocks, and consist of a small number of\r\nbrachiopods, molluscs, crustaceans, etc. These scanty records are\r\nsuggestive, and at least stimulate the hope that an extensive\r\npre-Cambrian fauna will ultimately be discovered. The few forms found\r\nseem to be not far different from the similar life records of the\r\nCambrian.\r\n\r\nThe Cambrian system, although first studied in Europe, has an important\r\ndevelopment in North America, and occurs at the surface at a large\r\nnumber of localities ranging from Newfoundland to California. The known\r\ndistribution of the system and the nature of the rocks composing it\r\nindicate that it occurs widely in the Continental basin beneath\r\nsubsequent deposits. The most interesting results derived from the study\r\nof the Cambrian, carried on especially by C. D. Walcott, pertain to its\r\nlife records. With the exception of a few obscure algae, all the fossils\r\nthus far discovered are marine invertebrates. As regards rank in the\r\nzoological scale, certain molluscan remains are the highest, but\r\noutclassing them in size, abundance, and degree of specialization are\r\nthe _trilobites_, the nearest living representatives of which are\r\ncertain crustaceans. Of the trilobites about 100 species have been\r\ndiscovered in the Cambrian rocks of North America, the largest\r\nindividual being about 20 inches in length.\r\n\r\nThe picture of the continent which the facts just referred to enables\r\none to sketch in fancy includes land areas destitute of animal life, and\r\nprobably without vegetation, except perhaps the lichens, the lowest of\r\nthe cryptogams. The sea, especially in its shallower portions near land\r\nand over its surface, contains algae, mostly, we presume, of small size,\r\nin fact microscopic, and soft tissued. The animal life subsisting\r\nprimarily on the algae are all invertebrates, and nearly all of them,\r\nexcepting the crustaceans, simple in organization. None of the animals\r\nthe remains of which have thus far been discovered had strong shells or\r\nother well-developed protective or supporting tissues, thus indicating\r\nthat they were not subject to the attacks of formidable enemies.\r\n\r\nAs compared with later faunas, the animals of the Cambrian were\r\nprimitive, but their diversity--every subkingdom of invertebrates being\r\nrepresented--is positive evidence that they were not the first\r\ninhabitants of the waters. Considered from the point of view of\r\ndevelopment, this fauna stands at least half-way, and some students of\r\nthe ancient history of the earth place it as far as nine-tenths of the\r\nway, up the life column--that is, the time from the first appearance of\r\nlife on the earth to the beginning of the Cambrian was at least as long\r\nand possibly nine times as long as the time that has since elapsed. This\r\nis a sufficient promise that many records of life, and it seems safe to\r\npredict as varied an assemblage of organisms as the at present\r\nknown Cambrian fauna, will ultimately be discovered in the Algonkian or\r\nlower rocks.\r\n\r\nThe Paleozoic era witnessed the first appearance of vertebrate life. The\r\nearliest known forms were fish-like in character and were succeeded in\r\nsequence by batrachians and reptiles. In this connection the most\r\nimportant contribution to the world's knowledge, from the study of the\r\nAmerican records, include the discovery of a large number of fishes, or\r\nfish-like forms, some of them of gigantic size, in the Devonian and\r\nCarboniferous rocks of the Ohio region, by J. S. Newberry; numerous\r\nbatrachians in the Coal Measures of Ohio, by E. D. Cope; of batrachians\r\nand probably reptiles in rocks of similar age in Nova Scotia, by J. W.\r\nDawson and O. C. Marsh.\r\n\r\nDuring the Paleozoic era land plants appeared, and before its close the\r\ncontinent was densely clothed with forests consisting of flowerless\r\nplants such as ferns and club-mosses, together with a less abundance of\r\ntrees related to the existing conifers.\r\n\r\nGreat additions to the world's knowledge of the varied and beautiful\r\nfloras of the swamps in which the coal-beds of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Nova\r\nScotia, etc., were accumulated have been made by H. D. Rogers, J. S.\r\nNewberry, Leo Lesquereux, J. W. Dawson, I. C. White, David White, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe Mesozoic era is characterized among other events by the first\r\nappearance and rapid development of flowering plants, the cycads being\r\nespecially numerous, and of our ordinary broad-leaved trees, such as the\r\noak, willow, sassafras, etc., and by the coming in of palms; and in the\r\nanimal kingdom by the culmination of reptilian life and the advent of\r\nbirds and mammals.\r\n\r\nThe American Mesozoic rocks have yielded a rich store of fossil plants,\r\nas is well known from the painstaking studies of J. S. Newberry, Leo\r\nLesquereux, W. M. Fontaine, L. F. Ward, F. H. Knowlton, and others.\r\nThese same students of the progress of plant life on the continent have\r\nalso made extensive and critical studies of the Cenozoic floras.\r\n\r\nThe relics of reptilian life brought to light from the Mesozoic rocks of\r\nNew Jersey, Kansas, Wyoming, etc., by Joseph Leidy, O. C. Marsh, E. D.\r\nCope, and others, have astonished the world, even though marvellous\r\nresults in a similar direction had previously been made known in Europe.\r\nThe reptilian age was marked in America by the presence of such huge\r\nreptiles, and by the strange development and adaptations in various\r\ndirections that they surpass the wildest dreams of fable. Lizard-like\r\nreptiles walked the earth that were 40 to 60 feet in length and stood 10\r\nto 14 feet high where the massive hind limbs joined the body. Their\r\nthigh-bones in certain instances measured over 6 feet in length. Some of\r\nthese monsters, it is estimated, weighed at least 10 tons. These, the\r\nhugest of all land animals, were vegetable feeders. Others, of less\r\nsize, although still gigantic and more active, were carnivorous. Some of\r\nthe old lizard-like forms which left their footprints in great abundance\r\nin the sands now hardened into sandstone in the Connecticut Valley and\r\nNew Jersey walked on their hind feet, after the manner of birds, and\r\nleft three-toed footmarks, some of them 20 inches in length, which are\r\nstrikingly bird-like in appearance. Other great reptiles, whale-like in\r\nappearance, inhabited the ocean. Yet more marvellous forms were provided\r\nwith wings, resembling those of bats, and in the case of the great\r\n_Pteranodons_ found in the rocks of Kansas had a \"stretch of wing\" of\r\nfully 20 feet. But the strange menagerie that has been resurrected\r\ncontains such a marvellous array of grotesque shapes that not even a\r\ncatalogue of the genera can be presented here.\r\n\r\nWhile the Mesozoic era was emphatically the age of reptiles, the coming\r\nof a more highly developed fauna was foreshadowed. Bird life was\r\nrepresented, and the skeletons of reptilian birds, or birds with teeth\r\nlike those of reptiles, have been discovered in the Mesozoic rocks of\r\nKansas. Important additions to our knowledge of these strange creatures,\r\nwhich furnish much instructive data in reference to the development of\r\nthe higher from the lower forms of life, have been made by O. C. Marsh.\r\nThe humble beginning of mammalian life is shown by insectivorous\r\nmarsupials, the jaws of which were discovered in the Newark system\r\n(Lower Mesozoic) of North Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe Cenozoic era is the age of mammals, so called because during that\r\ntime brute mammals succeeded reptiles as the rulers of the earth. From\r\nthe rocks deposited in North America during this era, principally the\r\nsediments of fresh-water lakes and the gravel-beds laid down by streams\r\nin the Pacific mountain region, a great number of skeletons of truly\r\nremarkable mammals, differing widely from anything now living, have been\r\ndiscovered by Joseph Leidy, O. C. Marsh, E. D. Cope, H. F. Osborn, and\r\nothers. The profound interest attached to this fauna, and the bearings\r\nit has on the study of the geographical distribution of animals,\r\nclimatic changes, etc., is indicated by the fact that it includes forms\r\nrelated to the rhinoceros, elephant, camel, etc., which are not\r\nrepresented among the animals now living on the continent, although\r\nhaving relatives in other and principally tropical countries.\r\n\r\nDuring the Psychozoic era mind gained ascendency over brute force, and\r\nman became the leader. The mammals continued to dominate the earth\r\nthroughout the Pleistocene period and were then probably more numerous\r\nand of even larger size than during the preceding Tertiary period.\r\nDuring the Pleistocene great climatic changes occurred, and large\r\nglaciers existed in several regions which now enjoy a temperate climate\r\nand are densely populated.\r\n\r\nThe presence of man in North America during the Pleistocene has not been\r\nproved, but important contributions to knowledge concerning the brute\r\nmammals, and in reference also to the climatic and physiographic\r\nchanges, have been made.\r\n\r\nIn stream-deposited gravels, caverns, peat swamps, etc., over the\r\nsurface of practically the entire continent, the bones of many species\r\nof large mammals have been obtained. These include the mastodon and\r\nelephant, megatherium, megalonyx, mylodon, a large horse, a great bison,\r\nan elk much exceeding the living species in size, a giant beaver,\r\nand many others remarkable for their large dimensions as compared with\r\ntheir living representatives. Several of these large animals survived\r\nthe vicissitudes of climate characteristic of the Glacial epoch, but\r\nhave since become extinct.\r\n\r\nThe chief contributions to Pleistocene history, however, made by\r\nAmerican geologists, are in connection with the records of climatic\r\nchanges. During the earlier portion of the period, and beginning perhaps\r\nin late Tertiary time, the continent in large part at least was more\r\nelevated than now and the energetic streams of the mountainous portions\r\neroded deep canyons. To this Sierran epoch, as it is termed, is referred\r\nthe excavation of the larger valleys of the Sierra Nevada, the\r\nworld-renowned canyons of the Colorado and Snake Rivers, and probably the\r\ndeep Valley of the St. Lawrence and the Hudson.\r\n\r\nA climatic change perhaps initiated by the greater elevation of the\r\nland, but not as yet wholly explained, caused glaciers to form about the\r\nhigher portions of a number of the ranges in the Pacific mountains, and\r\ncontinental glaciers of the type of the ice-sheet now covering Greenland\r\nto expand from at least three centres, termed the Labradorean, Keewatin,\r\nand Cordilleran, in what is now Canada. During this time of great ice\r\naccumulation and of glacial advance and retreat, or the Glacial epoch,\r\nas it is termed, fully one-half of North America was buried beneath\r\nice-sheets of the continental type. A composite map showing the portions\r\nof the continent which were covered with ice at one time or another\r\nduring the Glacial epoch is reproduced in Plate V.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.--Pleistocene glacial deposits.\r\n\r\n     NOTE: This map presents what may be termed a composite picture\r\n     of the extent of glacial ice during Pleistocene and Recent\r\n     time; Greenland, much of the Arctic archipelago, and many areas\r\n     in the Pacific mountains are still occupied by ice. The broken\r\n     blue lines on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts show\r\n     approximately the seaward extension of the Pleistocene\r\n     ice-sheets. The detached areas of glaciation in the western\r\n     portion of the United States are here assigned to the Wisconsin\r\n     stage, but in the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada there are\r\n     records of two ice advances. The drift in western Canada here\r\n     colored as Wisconsin is perhaps in part of later date.]\r\n\r\nDuring the maximum advance of the ice from the Labradorean centre into\r\nthe Continental basin it nearly reached the mouth of the Ohio River\r\n(near Cincinnati). An earlier advance from the Keewatin centre extended\r\nto the Missouri River in Missouri. There is evidence of a succession of\r\nadvances and retreats of the ice forming a very complex history. With\r\nits final retreat the Great Lakes came into existence and the continent\r\nreached the stage in its development when man became prominent.\r\n\r\nThe study of glacial geology in North America was initiated, or at least\r\ngiven a fresh start and in the proper direction, by Louis Agassiz, and\r\nwithin recent years energetically carried forward by a large number of\r\nearnest workers. The stage of advance reached in this branch of geology\r\nwhich serves so admirably to link the present with the past is well\r\npresented in the numerous publications of T. C. Chamberlin and his\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\nThe instructive history of the growth of North America and the\r\nsuccessive appearance of higher and higher forms of life, the records of\r\nwhich have been discovered in the sedimentary rocks, has been made known\r\nby the combined studies of a large number of investigators, but the\r\ngreat task has been carried on mainly under the auspices of various\r\nnational and State surveys. Chief among these is the present United\r\nStates Geological Survey, which has published what may be justly termed\r\na library of valuable literature and of topographic and geologic maps.\r\n\r\n_The Igneous Rocks_ (Plate IV).--Under the at present popular\r\nexplanation of the origin of the earth, namely, the nebular hypothesis,\r\nand also the modification of it termed the meteoric hypothesis, the\r\nplanet itself is considered to have been at one time in a molten\r\ncondition. The starting-point of the study of the rocks composing the\r\nearth should be, therefore, the primitive crust cooled from fusion. In\r\naddition to this there have been throughout history geologic migrations\r\nof molten matter from deep within the earth towards the surface, and a\r\npart of the material thus forced outward, principally through fissures,\r\nhas cooled in the rocks it penetrated, forming intrusions of various\r\nkinds, and a part has reached the surface and been extruded, as during\r\nvolcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\nProbably every known phase of vulcanism is illustrated by the igneous\r\nrocks of North America, and in certain branches of the subject, as the\r\nnature of intrusions and the changes which occur in the cooling of\r\nigneous magmas, marked advances in the world's knowledge have been made\r\nby American geologists.\r\n\r\nExamples of volcanic phenomena on a grand scale are furnished by the\r\nstill active volcanoes of the Caribbees, Central America, Mexico, and\r\nAlaska. Between southern Alaska and south-central Mexico there are no\r\nactive craters, but a large number of volcanic mountains in various\r\nstages of erosion which form an instructive series illustrating the\r\ninternal structure of the mode of accumulation of ejected fragment\r\nmaterial and of lava-flows. In this series of mountains built by igneous\r\nagencies belongs the great volcanic piles of the Cascade region, of\r\nwhich Mounts Baker, Rainier, Adams, Hood, Jefferson, Mazama, Shasta,\r\netc., are among the leading examples. Many other illustrations in the\r\nsame connection, some of them in an advanced stage of erosion and now\r\nrevealing only the dikes and necks of resistant rock that cooled and\r\nhardened well below the surface, occur widely throughout the southwest\r\nportion of the United States. The still recognisable volcanic mountains\r\nof the continent, with the exception of those of the Caribbees, are\r\nconfined to its western half, and with the exception of certain almost\r\nperfect craters in eastern New Mexico are all within the Pacific\r\nmountains. A great belt of volcanoes, including a large number of both\r\nactive and extinct examples, extends from Panama to the Aleutian\r\nIslands, a distance of some 7,000 miles, and is a part of the so-called\r\n\"circle of fire\" surrounding the Pacific Ocean. This belt is about 1,000\r\nmiles broad in its central part, where only extinct volcanoes exist, and\r\nnarrows towards both its northern and southern extremities, which are\r\ndefined by still steaming craters. The narrow northern portion,\r\ninclusive of the active volcanoes of the Alaskan Peninsula and the\r\nAleutian Islands, is prolonged westward, and forms a curve concave to\r\nthe southward, while the equally narrow southern portion marked by the\r\nenergetic craters of Central America forms a curve concave to the\r\nnorthward. The entire belt has something the shape of a sigmoid curve,\r\nwith a wide central portion.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding sketch of the growth of the continent it was shown that\r\nthe Pacific mountain region is younger than the Atlantic mountain\r\nregion. In this same connection certain interesting general conclusions\r\nhave been reached in reference to igneous activity. In each of the great\r\ncordilleras referred to there have been extensive breaks in the earth's\r\ncrust through which molten rocks have been forced upward. Volcanoes and\r\nvarious intrusions have been formed in each region, but in the eastern\r\nhalf of the continent the time since the last eruptions has been so\r\ngreat that all evidence in the relief of the land of the former presence\r\nof volcanic mountains has been obliterated. Erosion has cut deeply into\r\nthe rocks on which the ancient volcanoes stood, and revealed in some\r\ninstances the dikes occupying the fissures which supplied them. A large\r\nnumber of dikes of igneous rock occur in the Atlantic coast region from\r\nPrince Edward Island southward to Alabama and Georgia, and vast\r\nlava-flows of ancient date are still preserved about the south shore of\r\nLake Superior. Volcanic eruptions in the older half of the continent\r\nhave long since ceased and the breaks which gave them existence have\r\nbeen healed. The later movements in the western half of the continent\r\nhave caused fresh fractures to form, through which molten matter has\r\nbeen forced to the surface. Many facts have been observed in each region\r\nwhich show an intimate connection between movements in the earth's crust\r\nwhich have produced fractures and the distribution of volcanoes.\r\n\r\nThe lavas poured out by the more recent volcanoes of North America are\r\nmainly dark basic rocks, among which basalt predominates. An exception\r\noccurs in the case of the Mono craters near Mono Lake, California, which\r\nin recent time extruded a thick, viscous, highly siliceous, rhyolitic\r\nlava, much of which cooled quickly and formed volcanic glass or\r\nobsidian.\r\n\r\nIn addition to streams and sheets of lava, many volcanoes, and\r\nespecially those in a state of explosive eruption, blew into the air\r\nquantities of fragmental material, such as scoria, bombs, volcanic\r\ngravel (lapilli), dust, etc., which was scattered far and wide over the\r\nland. More or less extensive sheets of this material, in many instances\r\ninterstratified with sedimentary beds, and especially with the\r\nstrata laid down in Tertiary lakes, or separating lava-flows, occur\r\nwidely throughout the Pacific mountains. Dust showers of the nature just\r\nreferred to have occurred at a recent date, and the fine white material\r\nthat fell is now found at the surface in a large number of localities,\r\nranging from Central America to the Yukon Valley and from Kansas and\r\nNebraska to Oregon and Washington.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable instance of the addition of volcanic rocks to the\r\nsurface of North America is in the case of the Columbia River lava,\r\nwhich covers some 200,000 or more square miles of country in Washington,\r\nOregon, and neighbouring States. In that region outwellings of highly\r\nliquid rock came from fissures and spread widely over the surface as\r\nveritable inundations, which on cooling became black, basaltic rock, but\r\nwithout forming mountains or craters. Where the Snake River has\r\nexcavated its magnificent canyon in these still horizontal layers of\r\nbasalt, a thickness of 4,000 feet is revealed, although the stream has\r\nnot as yet cut through the formation, and in Stein Mountain, Oregon, a\r\nsimilar series of lava-sheets over 5,000 feet thick has been measured.\r\nThe Columbia River lava was spread over the surface of a deeply eroded\r\nland in a series of vast overflows of molten material. The liquid rock\r\ncovered the broad plains and extended into the valleys in the adjacent\r\nmountains, giving them level floors of basalt. Mountain spurs became\r\ncapes and headlands and outstanding buttes were transformed into islands\r\nin the molten sea. The lava since cooled and crystallized has in places\r\nbeen folded and tilted; streams like the Columbia, Snake, Spokane\r\nRivers, etc., have carved great canyons in it, and the surface,\r\nespecially where it is still nearly horizontal, has decayed and yielded\r\na wonderfully rich soil. It is the fine, rich residual material of these\r\nlava plains, redistributed in part by the wind, which furnishes the\r\nbasis for the immense wheat industry of the northwestern portion of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe extrusion of molten rock from deep within the earth so as to form\r\nvolcanoes or fissure eruptions at the surface is only a part of a widely\r\nextended and highly varied process. As geologists have discovered,\r\nparticularly in deeply eroded regions, by no means all of the fissures\r\nwhich permit of the forcing upward of molten material in them reach the\r\nsurface. Many of them died out before coming to the light and favoured\r\nthe production of various forms of intrusion.\r\n\r\nA fissure originating deep in the earth's crust and extending upward,\r\nperhaps with many branches and irregularities, if injected with molten\r\nrock from below gives origin to dikes. That is, a dike is a more or less\r\nvertical sheet of igneous rock which has cooled and crystallized in a\r\nfissure. Such sheets of intruded material cutting across the bedding of\r\nstratified rocks, or traversing older igneous or metamorphic terranes,\r\nare of common occurrence and are frequently abundant in deeply eroded\r\nregions. They occur particularly in mountains of upheaval, thus\r\ndemonstrating the fact that to a large extent the fissure which became\r\ninjected with molten magmas and perhaps gave origin to volcanoes, are\r\ndue to movements in the rocks composing the earth's crust. The force\r\nwhich causes molten rock to rise in such fissures also tends to prolong\r\nand enlarge them. The heat of an intruded magma affects the rocks it\r\ntraverses and produces what is termed contact metamorphism. Examples of\r\ndikes in the Newark system have already been referred to, and others are\r\ncommon throughout the Pacific mountains. Where the Columbia River lava\r\nin central Washington has been removed by erosion, hundreds, and in fact\r\nthousands, of dikes are exposed in the terranes on which it formerly\r\nrested.\r\n\r\nWhen a dike ends above in horizontally bedded rocks it sometimes happens\r\nthat the injected magma, especially if highly fluid, is forced in\r\nbetween the strata and spreads widely between the layers, forming an\r\nintruded sheet, which lifts a broad cover to a height equal to its own\r\nthickness. An example of an intrusion of this nature is furnished by the\r\npalisade trap-sheet in New Jersey and New York, which has a maximum\r\nthickness of about 1,000 feet, and is fully 100 miles in length from\r\nnorth to south. The portion which remains is but a remnant and is\r\nseldom over 2 or 3 miles wide. This sheet in common with its associated\r\nsandstones and shales has been tilted so as to dip westward at an angle\r\nof about 15 degrees, and its eastern border eroded so as to form the\r\npicturesque Palisades on the west bank of the Hudson opposite New York\r\ncity. Many other similar intruded sheets are known in Nova Scotia, the\r\nConnecticut Valley, among the Pacific mountains, etc.\r\n\r\nA marked variation in the process just outlined occurs when, as the\r\ncontrolling condition, the intruded magma is highly viscous instead of\r\nhighly fluid, and the friction of contact and of flow is greatly\r\nincreased. Under such circumstances the intruded magma expands less\r\nwidely than is the case when an intruded sheet is formed, and a thick\r\nintrusion results, which lifts a small cover perhaps to a great height.\r\nIntrusions of this nature are sometimes expanded in their upper portions\r\ninto a more or less mushroom shape, and from their fancied resemblance\r\nto cisterns of once molten rock within older terranes have been termed\r\n_laccoliths_. The typical examples are furnished by the Henry Mountains\r\nin southern Utah, described by G. K. Gilbert. Other similar intrusions\r\nin Colorado have been studied by Whitman Cross, and yet other examples\r\nhave been discovered in various parts of the Pacific mountains. In the\r\ncase of certain of the laccoliths in the Henry Mountains, now laid bare\r\nby erosion, the cistern-like mass of intruded material is 12,000 feet or\r\nmore in diameter, some 5,000 feet thick in the central part, and lifted\r\na cover of stratified rocks fully 7,000 feet thick.\r\n\r\nWhere a dike ends above in older rocks, and particularly in horizontally\r\nstratified sedimentary beds, in a pipe-like form, similar to the conduit\r\nof a volcano, but without reaching the surface, the unexpanded or but\r\nslightly enlarged summit portion lifts a comparatively small cover into\r\na dome, and what has been termed a plutonic plug results.\r\n\r\nAll the various phases of intrusions thus far referred to, it will be\r\nreadily seen, are variations of one process. The wide range in\r\nthe results produced are dependent on local conditions, either in\r\nrespect to terranes invaded, as, for example, whether or not they are\r\nundisturbed sedimentary beds, and on the physical condition of the\r\nintruded material, in reference especially to its degree of viscosity.\r\nThere is an intimate and even a genetic connection between intrusions on\r\nthe one hand and volcanic and fissure eruptions on the other. If\r\nfissures lead from portions of the earth's crust sufficiently deep to\r\npermit the rocks to become plastic or fused on account of the relief of\r\npressure due to the opening of the fissure, the magma may be forced to\r\nthe surface, becoming more and more plastic or more perfectly fluid as\r\nthe weight upon it decreased, and volcanic phenomena result; or if the\r\nfissure fails to reach the surface intrusions of various forms may be\r\nproduced. The simplest form of intrusion, the dike, results under\r\nwhatever condition the summit portion of the magma comes to rest. A\r\nmagma forced upward in fissures in the earth's crust may meet moist\r\nrocks or even reservoirs of water, and in such instances steam or gases\r\nare produced and a new force is added, which may produce explosions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the intrusions of the various classes just referred to\r\nthere are others on a far larger scale, examples of which occur in North\r\nAmerica, but as yet their mode of origin has been but little studied. I\r\nrefer to vast upwellings of molten or plastic material beneath the more\r\nrigid portions of the earth's crust, which elevate domes, perhaps 200 or\r\n300 miles or more in their various horizontal diameters. The great areas\r\noccupied by intrusive granite, as the one from which the Bitter Root\r\nMountains in Idaho have been sculptured, are of this nature. These\r\n\"regional intrusions,\" as they may be termed, elevate mountains in the\r\nsame general manner as in the case of laccoliths, but of far greater\r\nsize. To the elevations produced in this manner I have ventured to apply\r\nthe name _subtuberant mountains_, in expression of the idea that they\r\nhave resulted from vertical uplifts, due to the upswelling of molten\r\nmaterial beneath.\r\n\r\n_The Metamorphic Rocks_ (Plate IV).--At the contact of either\r\nsedimentary or igneous rocks with intrusive rocks of whatever form, such\r\nas dikes, sheets, laccoliths, etc., there has been in many well-known\r\ninstances an alteration of the terranes penetrated or uplifted which is\r\nmost intense along the contact and diminishes at a distance. This change\r\nor metamorphism, as it is termed, consists of an alteration in the\r\ncolour, texture, hardness, mineral and chemical composition, etc., of\r\nthe rocks affected, and may be manifest throughout a thickness of but a\r\nfew feet, or perhaps only a few inches, but near large intrusions is apt\r\nto be traceable for scores or hundreds of feet. In the case of intense\r\ncontact metamorphism, the altered rock assumes a new form, and may\r\nexhibit a crystalline and foliated or schistose structure. The changes\r\nreferred to are most marked when water is present, and are thought to be\r\ndue largely to the influence of heated water percolating through the\r\nrocks and producing changes by solution and deposition. The principal\r\nagencies which take part in contact metamorphism are heat, heated\r\nwaters, pressure, and perhaps movements within the rocks.\r\n\r\nThere are extensive regions throughout which the rocks have been changed\r\nin a manner similar to the alterations commonly found adjacent to\r\nigneous intrusions which, in general, have been brought about in some\r\nother way. This regional metamorphism, as it is termed, has affected the\r\nrocks in certain instances throughout districts measuring many hundreds\r\nof square miles in surface extent, and with a vertical range of many\r\nthousands of feet. The rocks referred to have been changed without\r\nfusion from a previous condition, during which they were either\r\nsedimentary beds or cooled and crystallized igneous magma. This\r\nconclusion has been verified in numerous instances by tracing the\r\nthoroughly altered rocks to regions where the change has been less\r\nintense and finally to where they pass by insensible gradations into\r\neasily recognisable sedimentary or igneous terranes. Common examples of\r\nmetamorphic rocks are mica, schist, gneiss, statuary marble,\r\ncertain granites, etc. These rocks frequently have a foliated or fissile\r\nstructure, such as it is presumed would result from a flowing movement\r\nwithin the mass while under great pressure. Characteristically also the\r\nrocks are composed of interlocking crystals or portions of crystals,\r\nwhich are not contained in a glassy base, as is the case with most rocks\r\nthat have crystallized from fusion. That is, the metamorphic rocks are\r\ncharacteristically _holocrystalline_, while igneous rocks are\r\n_porphyritic_, or _cryptocrystalline_.\r\n\r\nThe analogy between rocks altered by contact metamorphism and those\r\naffected by regional metamorphism had led to the conclusion that the\r\nlatter, like the former, have been changed by heat and the passage\r\nthrough them of heated water bearing mineral matter, and especially\r\nsilica, in solution. More than this, the foliation frequently so\r\ncharacteristic of metamorphic rocks is considered as evidence of a\r\nflowing movement or shearing of the material while under pressure. In\r\nshort, rocks are altered by heat, especially if water is present in\r\nthem, by motion, and by chemical changes produced by percolating waters,\r\nand perhaps in still other ways. The degree of heat required is not\r\ndefinitely known, and probably varies according to the nature of the\r\nrocks, the presence or absence of water, etc., but is certainly less\r\nthan that necessary to produce fusion, and is thought, in general, to be\r\nin the neighbourhood of 750 deg. F. While heat alone is considered as\r\nsufficient to produce metamorphism, it is probable that in most\r\ninstances two or more of the agencies just referred to have been in\r\noperation at the same time. In the case of the foliated rocks motion\r\nwithin the mass seems to have been the predominating factor, and\r\ndynamical metamorphism is considered as important as heat metamorphism.\r\n\r\nIn North America, as is indicated roughly on the map forming Plate IV,\r\nmetamorphic rocks occur at the surface over a great region in eastern\r\nand northeastern Canada, in Labrador and Newfoundland, in the New\r\nEngland States, and thence southward along the eastern side of the\r\nAppalachians. Other extensive regions occupied by similar rocks\r\noccur in many of the ranges of the Pacific mountains, from Alaska to\r\nPanama, and are known in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nNot only do the metamorphosed rocks outcrop at the surface over large\r\nareas, but, as may be inferred from such outcrops, as well as from the\r\nrecords of numerous borings, underlies nearly the entire extent of the\r\nsedimentary formations. The basal portion of the continent, with the\r\nexception of certain areas where igneous rocks occur, is formed of\r\nmetamorphosed terranes. So generally is this true, that it is safe to\r\nsay that if a boring is begun at any locality on the continent where\r\nsedimentary beds occur, and is continued downward until the sedimentary\r\nrocks are passed through, metamorphic terranes will be found beneath.\r\nThe same is true also where the surface is composed of lava-sheets. The\r\nexceptions, where metamorphosed rocks do not occur beneath sedimentary\r\nor volcanic beds, are when igneous intrusions or ancient lava-flows are\r\npresent at a depth.\r\n\r\nIn the brief description given of the Archean system on a preceding\r\npage, it was stated that the rocks composing it are largely metamorphic.\r\nBut rocks of practically any age may be altered in the several ways\r\nmentioned above, and the resulting gneisses, schists, etc., be\r\nindistinguishable from those of the Archean. In fact, some of the\r\nmetamorphosed rocks of North America, as certain gneisses, schists,\r\netc., of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mountains, are known to be of\r\nMesozoic and even Cenozoic age.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the growth of North America, and again in connection with\r\nthe distribution of volcanic mountains, it was shown that there has been\r\na progressive migration of the field of action of the forces which\r\nupheave the rocks so as to form land areas, and also of the movements in\r\nthe rocks which produce fractures and lead to the origin of volcanoes.\r\nIn a similar way the sphere of influence of metamorphism as indicated by\r\nthe age of the transformed rocks in various regions has in a general way\r\nmigrated from east to west across the continent.\r\n\r\nIn the Laurentian Highlands the metamorphosed rocks are of pre-Cambrian\r\nage; in New England and the Appalachian region they are, in part at\r\nleast, of Paleozoic age; and in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mountains\r\nmetamorphosed Mesozoic and Cenozoic rocks occur. As movements in the\r\nouter portion of the earth's crust may produce fractures in any class of\r\nrocks, and as such fractures favour the intrusion of igneous material,\r\nthe metamorphic rocks may contain igneous intrusions similar to those\r\nnoted above in connection with sedimentary rocks. As the stratification\r\nso marked in sedimentary beds is lacking in metamorphosed rocks, it is\r\nnot to be expected that intrusions will take the form of sheets,\r\nlaccoliths, etc., but rather appear as dikes with perhaps irregular\r\nbranches. As the same region may experience two or more periods of\r\nmetamorphism, it is evident that great complexities may arise, as, for\r\nexample, when a metamorphosed terrane is penetrated by dikes and\r\nirregular intrusions and again subjected to metamorphosing conditions.\r\nThese considerations lead to the suggestion that rocks metamorphosed in\r\npre-Cambrian time, for example, would be apt to be more complex than\r\nthose of Mesozoic date. In general, this has been found to be true, as\r\nis suggested by the fact that to the pre-Cambrian metamorphosed\r\nterranes, as previously stated, the name Basement Complex has been\r\napplied.\r\n\r\n_Summary._--The relation of the three great divisions into which the\r\nrocks composing North America, in common with all other portions of the\r\nknown lithosphere, are divided, may perhaps be better understood when it\r\nis remembered that the igneous rocks came _from below_ in a molten\r\ncondition; that the sedimentary rocks have been formed _at the surface_\r\nfrom the _debris_ of either igneous, metamorphic, or previously formed\r\nsedimentary beds; and that metamorphic rocks have been produced _within_\r\nthe earth's outer crust by the alteration of either igneous or\r\nsedimentary rocks. When the heat which produced certain phases of\r\nmetamorphism is sufficiently increased, greater freedom of molecular and\r\nchemical changes occur and the material acted on passes to the\r\ncondition of an igneous magma. The three great classes of rocks\r\nconsidered above are thus seen to be but stages in a cycle which the\r\nmaterial of the lithosphere passes through.\r\n\r\nThe conditions which bring about these changes are still in action and\r\nare intimately associated with movements in the rocks of the earth's\r\ncrust. When elevation raises a portion of the earth's crust above\r\nsea-level, erosion and redeposition ensue and sedimentary rocks are\r\nformed; the greater the elevation the more energetically the forces act\r\nwhich bring about denudation, transportation, and sedimentation. When\r\ndepression occurs of sufficient amount to carry rocks previously at or\r\nnear the surface into the zone of metamorphism, alterations follow, and\r\nin general the deeper the depression the greater the changes until\r\nmetamorphism culminates in fusion, providing pressure does not\r\ncounteract the influence of heat. Dynamical and chemical metamorphism\r\nmay occur at less depth than purely heat metamorphism, and it may be\r\npresumed takes place in the axes of mountain ranges, even above\r\nsea-level. Such a broad view of the relations and genesis of the three\r\ngreat lithologic divisions of the material forming the earth's outer\r\ncrust is necessary to the understanding of the conditions observed in\r\nthe basal portion of the geological column, as it is termed, in which\r\nthe age and order of succession of the sedimentary rocks is indicated.\r\nIn certain localities, for example, the Cambrian rocks rest\r\nunconformably on a surface of metamorphic and igneous rocks--that is,\r\nthe Basement Complex was raised above sea-level, eroded and subsequently\r\ndepressed before the Cambrian sediments were laid upon it. In other\r\nlocalities the Cambrian rocks pass indefinitely into metamorphosed\r\nterranes beneath, which means that metamorphism invaded the series after\r\nthe deposition of the Cambrian, and the characteristics of its junction\r\nwith older rocks was obliterated. Similar relations may evidently be\r\ndiscovered at any horizon in the geological column. Obviously the\r\nchances of a system of stratified rocks becoming metamorphosed or of\r\nbeing removed by erosion, are greater the nearer their position\r\nto the base of the sedimentary series; in a similar way the chances of a\r\nsedimentary terrane becoming invaded by igneous intrusions is greater\r\nthe greater its age; again, the older a sedimentary terrane the greater\r\nthe chances of its becoming buried by subsequent deposition and the less\r\nthe likelihood of its being exposed for study. The only position in\r\nwhich a sedimentary formation can maintain its integrity and be safe\r\nfrom destruction by erosion or transformation by metamorphism is below\r\nsea-level and above the zone of heat metamorphism; but even in this\r\nposition it may have its distinctive features, including its fossils,\r\nobliterated by dynamical and chemical alterations. These suggestions are\r\noffered for the sake of indicating, as stated on a previous page, that\r\nthe Cambrian and Algonkian rocks should not be considered as the first\r\nformed sediments, and that there is hope of the discovery of a rich\r\nfauna of older date than any at present known. In the search for the\r\nearliest evidence of animal life on the earth, North America holds out\r\nfavourable conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE CONCENTRATION OF MINERAL SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe most important branch of geology treats of the substances in the\r\nearth's crust that are of direct service to man, as, for example,\r\nbuilding stones, coal, iron, petroleum, gold, etc. Only a glance can\r\nhere be given at the conditions which have led to the origin of the\r\nmaterials of commercial value and to their geographical distribution.\r\n\r\nFrom the mode of origin of the principal classes of rocks it may be\r\nreasonably inferred that certain minerals and ores will be developed or\r\nconcentrated in one class of rocks and not in the others. To a great\r\nextent the facts observed during the development of mines, etc., sustain\r\nthis prediction.\r\n\r\nIn the cooling and crystallizing of igneous rocks from a state of fusion\r\nmany minerals are formed, the most common being silicates of the\r\nalkaline earths, which are usually inclosed in a glassy or\r\ncryptocrystalline base. The igneous rocks have characteristically\r\na highly complex chemical composition, and although frequently\r\ncontaining the metallic element, etc., which are of economic importance,\r\nthese are widely disseminated, and in nearly all cases in chemical\r\ncombinations, as the minor ingredients of siliceous minerals. Although\r\nthe igneous rocks sometimes contain valuable ores, they are in many, if\r\nnot all instances, due to secondary enrichment and are not a result of\r\nprimary crystallization from fusion. As all the material of the earth's\r\ncrust was at one stage in the series of changes it has experienced\r\nconsolidated from fusion, it follows that the ores and minerals now of\r\neconomic value did not then exist, or were widely diffused and have\r\nsince been formed or concentrated.\r\n\r\nThe processes of concentration referred to are carried on in various\r\nways through the agency of mechanical, chemical, vital, molecular, and\r\nelectrical forces, acting singly or in association. For example,\r\nconcentration through the action of mechanical agencies is illustrated\r\nby the manner in which rocks are reduced to fragments in the every-day\r\nprocess of denudation and the resulting _debris_ removed by streams and\r\nredeposited. In this process an assorting in reference to size, specific\r\ngravity, etc., takes place, and certain substances, as sand, for\r\ninstance, is accumulated in one locality, and certain other substances,\r\nas clay, deposited in another locality. During this process gold,\r\nplatinum, etc., owing to their high specific gravity, may be\r\nconcentrated in stream channels. The accumulation of mineral matter\r\nthrough the action mainly of chemical agencies, occurs when the waters\r\npercolating through rocks dissolves certain substances, as calcium\r\ncarbonate, for instance, and on coming to the surface as springs, or\r\ndripping from the roofs of caverns, deposit calcareous tufa,\r\nstalactites, etc. Silica, iron, manganese, and other substances are\r\nfrequently concentrated in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nConcentration of previously widely disseminated substances principally\r\nthrough the agency of vital forces, is illustrated by the manner in\r\nwhich molluscs and polyps obtain calcium carbonate from water and\r\ndeposit it in their shells or skeletons. The part played by plants in\r\nthis same connection is shown by the way in which they eliminate carbon\r\ndioxide from the air or from water, and concentrate the carbon in their\r\ntissues. From the carbon accumulated in this manner, under certain\r\nconditions, deposits of peat, lignite, coal, graphite, etc., have\r\nresulted.\r\n\r\nWhat may provisionally at least be termed molecular concentration occurs\r\nwhen similar molecules are brought together largely by water and\r\ncrystallized to form mineral species. In order to simplify this brief\r\ndiscussion as much as practicable, this phase of concentration will be\r\nincluded under the chemical processes referred to above.\r\n\r\nThe three principal methods by which mineral substances are\r\nconcentrated, namely, the mechanical, chemical, and vital, have in the\r\nmain different fields of action. The mechanical and vital agencies\r\noperate at the surface of the lithosphere, although organic products,\r\nprincipally certain acids, descend into the earth in solution in water\r\nand play an important part in deep-seated chemical changes, as in the\r\nformation of mineral veins. The chemical agencies bring about the\r\nconcentration of mineral substances both at or near the surface and at a\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\nThe intensity with which the several agencies just referred to operate\r\nvaries according to conditions. The mechanical agencies, for example,\r\nacting mainly through the aid of flowing water, are in general most\r\npotent in humid regions and where the land is high above sea-level.\r\nVital agencies depend largely on climate and are most active in warm\r\nhumid regions. The chemical agencies are influenced largely by heat, the\r\npresence of water, and by pressure.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that a high degree of heat leads to the\r\ndissipation and wide distribution of substances previously concentrated;\r\nfusion, for example, permitting of the intimate mingling or\r\nrecombination of substances, previously segregated, although during the\r\ndying stages of volcanic activity minerals like sulphur, cinnabar, etc.,\r\nmay be directly condensed and thus concentrated from a vaporous\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nDuring the formation of the three main classes of rocks composing the\r\nearth's crust, the agencies leading to the concentration of various\r\nsubstances now of economic importance have to a great extent been\r\ndifferent, and hence in a marked way the stones, ores, fuels, gems,\r\netc., to be expected in each of the three classes of rocks,\r\nrespectively, are distinct. Certain exceptions to this broad conclusion,\r\nhowever, arise from the fact that rocks belonging to each of the classes\r\nreferred to may have been brought within the influence of the same or\r\nsimilar concentrating agencies and like results produced in each class.\r\n\r\n_Economic Importance of the Igneous Terranes._--The igneous rocks, as\r\npreviously noted, are such as have cooled from fusion. On the cooling of\r\nmagmas various minerals are formed, most commonly silicates, and except\r\nin a minor way in connection with the weaker stages of volcanic activity\r\nand the slow cooling of the rocks, there does not seem to be any marked\r\ntendency towards the concentration or segregation of metallic minerals\r\nor ores. Although igneous rocks do contain gold, silver, copper, etc.,\r\nand a large variety of the rarer metals, they are widely disseminated.\r\nAs is well known, however, igneous rocks are in some instances of value\r\nfor the metallic mineral, gems, and ores associated with them, but in\r\nthe great majority of instances at least, and as a rule, these minerals\r\nand ores are the result of subsequent changes and owe their origin\r\nmainly to deposition from heated, percolating water. Rich ore bodies\r\nfrequently occur on the borders of igneous dikes, and in fissures and\r\ncavities in igneous rocks, but the process by which they have been\r\nformed is similar to that leading to the concentration of mineral matter\r\nin metamorphic rocks, and will be referred to later.\r\n\r\nThe igneous rocks themselves furnish desirable building stones, such as\r\ngranite, diorite, porphyry, diabase, etc. With the exception of granite\r\nand the nearly related diorite, these have not as yet been extensively\r\nutilized in North America. Certain of the igneous rocks have been\r\naltered to serpentine, which on account of its pleasing green colour and\r\nthe ease with which it can be cut and polished furnishes a stone\r\nvaluable for interior uses. It is also employed, usually with a rough\r\nsurface, in the construction of exterior walls of dwellings, gateways,\r\netc. Large bodies of serpentine occur at a number of localities in the\r\nAtlantic mountains from Pennsylvania and Maryland northward, including\r\neastern Canada, and also over extensive areas in the Pacific mountains,\r\nparticularly in California, Washington, and Alaska.\r\n\r\nThe principal ores and minerals of commercial importance in the igneous\r\nrocks are native copper, as in northern Michigan; copper pyrites, as at\r\nButte, Montana; gold, at many localities, including the Treadwell mine,\r\nAlaska; opal, which is mined on a small scale in Idaho and Washington.\r\nIn practically all these instances, and numerous others that might be\r\nenumerated, the substances referred to have been deposited from solution\r\nin cavities in the rocks or have replaced other substances, and are due\r\nto what is termed above chemical concentration.\r\n\r\n_Economic Importance of the Sedimentary Terranes._--The sedimentary\r\nrocks are composed principally of fragmental material derived from the\r\ndisintegration of older rocks transported and deposited mechanically,\r\nand resulting in the formation of sandstone, shale, etc., and of\r\norganically concentrated material, such as shells and corals, which form\r\nlimestones. The deposits originating in these ways furnish excellent\r\nbuilding stones, the principal classes being sandstones and limestones.\r\nThese occur widely throughout North America, and in formations of all\r\nages subsequent to the Archean. The sandstones were deposited near the\r\nshores of the seas, or in lakes, and the limestones principally in\r\nmoderately deep oceans.\r\n\r\nSandstones occur largely in the Cambrian formation on the south shore of\r\nLake Superior and about the borders of the Adirondack hills of New York.\r\nThey are usually red or reddish-brown rocks, and their pleasing colours,\r\ndurability, even grain, and the readiness with which they may be broken\r\nin any direction make them desirable building stones.\r\n\r\nThe Newark system, extending in detached areas from Nova Scotia\r\nto South Carolina, contains immense quantities of brown and gray\r\nsandstone, which have been extensively quarried, particularly in the\r\nConnecticut Valley, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, and largely\r\nused in Atlantic coast cities. The Carboniferous and Devonian\r\nsandstones, usually of a gray colour, of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and\r\nneighbouring States, are largely used in the cities of the interior\r\nportions of the United States. Extensive deposits of Mesozoic and\r\nCenozoic sandstones occur throughout the Pacific mountains, and afford a\r\npractically unlimited supply of good building material, which as yet has\r\nbeen but little utilized. The colours of sandstones vary from bright red\r\nthrough brown-yellow to gray, and in some cases are nearly white,\r\ndepending largely on the condition of the iron present. The red rocks\r\nare dyed with ferric oxide; the brownstones contain iron, frequently in\r\nthe cementing material that unites the grains, in various stages of\r\noxidation and hydration; the gray stones may also contain iron, but if\r\npresent it is in union with organic matter, as the ferric carbonate, for\r\nexample. The Cambrian and Newark sandstones are prevailingly of some\r\nshade of red, for the reason that not enough organic matter is present\r\nto change the iron to a carbonate.\r\n\r\nThe sandstones when of an even fine grain and not too hard, are suitable\r\nfor sharpening tools, and large quantities of grindstones, whetstones,\r\netc., are made from them, as on the Lake Huron shore of Michigan, in\r\nOhio, etc. Other sandstones, practically free from iron, are used in the\r\nmanufacture of glass. The best example of \"glass sand\" is the Sylvania\r\nsandstone of southeastern Michigan. Unconsolidated sand is largely used\r\nin mixing mortars and cements, for smoothing stones used for\r\narchitectural and monumental purposes, as foundry sand in making moulds\r\nfor casting, and many other ways. Seaward from where sand is being\r\ndeposited we find in the present oceans that as a rule fine bluish or\r\ngreenish mud occurs, and still farther seaward, except where\r\ncoral-polyps thrive, usually at a distance of 100 miles or more from\r\nland, the bottom is composed of calcareous mud or ooze. The sand\r\nand mud are derived from the land, and if consolidated form sandstone\r\nand shale. The calcareous ooze is derived from the life of the sea,\r\nlargely minute lime-secreting foraminifera, together with shells of\r\nmolluscs, and in the vicinity of coral islands or reefs the hard parts\r\nof coral growth are added. That is, the calcareous oozes are formed by\r\nthe concentration of calcium carbonate through the vital action of\r\nanimals and to a less extent of plants. Such material, if consolidated,\r\nwould form ordinary limestone.\r\n\r\nIn North America there are terranes scores of hundreds of miles across\r\nin various directions and hundreds and even thousands of feet thick that\r\nhave been formed in the manner just indicated. From this mode of origin\r\nit may be truthfully inferred that limestone may have been formed during\r\nany age since organisms having the power of secreting calcium carbonate\r\nexisted on the earth. The limestones of North America range in age from\r\nthe Algonkian period to the present time, and are still being formed in\r\nthe ocean and in a minor way in lakes.\r\n\r\nImpure limestones, frequently coloured or clouded with red, due to\r\nferric oxide, are quarried on an extensive scale in eastern Tennessee,\r\nand are used for decorative purposes. The Tennessee limestones referred\r\nto are of Paleozoic age; in Florida porous rocks, known as coquina,\r\ncomposed of imperfectly consolidated shells of living species of\r\nmolluscs, are used in the construction of buildings. Gray limestones\r\nsusceptible of a good polish occur in Ohio and neighbouring States and\r\nare utilized to some extent for columns and interior finish of\r\nbuildings, but in the main the stones of this nature when employed for\r\narchitectural purposes are rough-faced. Vast amounts of limestone\r\nsuitable for masonry occur widely throughout the Mississippi Valley in\r\nmany of the ranges of the Pacific mountains, especially in the United\r\nStates and Mexico, and are also of immense thickness in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nIn many instances limestone has been metamorphosed, as will be described\r\nbelow, and converted into crystalline marble. Commercially, however, all\r\nlimestone, whether crystalline or not, which is susceptible of a\r\npolish, is termed marble.\r\n\r\nUnder certain conditions calcium carbonate is concentrated at or near\r\nthe earth's surface by chemical agencies, as about springs where\r\ncalcareous tufa, travertine, etc., are precipitated, and in caverns\r\nwhere stalactites and stalagmites are formed. Stalagmite sheets are\r\nsometimes composed of variegated, laminated layers, and when polished\r\nproduce a beautiful decorative stone which passes under the name of onyx\r\nmarble. Deposits of this character of commercial importance occur in\r\nArizona and Mexico.\r\n\r\nCalcium carbonate concentrated in lakes through the combined action of\r\nchemical and vital agencies produces the so-called marl, now extensively\r\nutilized in the manufacture of Portland cement. In this mode of\r\naccumulation the calcium carbonate is dissolved by percolating waters\r\nfrom the rocks and soils and carried to lakes in solution; it is there\r\nprecipitated largely through the vital action of certain algae and\r\ndeposited as a fine white ooze. Thousands of deposits of this nature,\r\nvarying in extent up to several hundred acres, and having a depth of\r\nfrom a few feet to 40 and even 60 or more feet, occur in the portion of\r\nthe continent covered with glacial drift, and especially in the States\r\nfrom New England to Minnesota. The reasons for the greater abundance of\r\nmarl in this region than elsewhere are that the glacial drift is there\r\nhighly calcareous, numerous lakes are present, and the climatic\r\nconditions are such as to favour the growth of certain aquatic plants,\r\nand especially the _Characeae_ or stoneworts, which have the property of\r\neliminating calcium carbonate from ordinary lake waters.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the vital agencies in concentrating substances of\r\neconomic value is illustrated by the manner in which coal, petroleum,\r\nand natural or rock-gas, etc., have been formed.\r\n\r\nLand plants have the power, under the influence of light, of decomposing\r\nthe carbon dioxide (carbonic-acid gas) of the air and fixing the carbon\r\nin their tissues, the oxygen being liberated and rendered\r\navailable for animal respiration. Carbon is thus concentrated, and when\r\nplant remains accumulate and are preserved beneath water in swamps, a\r\nslow change takes place and peat is formed. The essential conditions for\r\nthe accumulation of vegetable matter have been present on the earth ever\r\nsince a land flora existed, and coal-beds occur at many different\r\nhorizons. The earliest date at which land plants seem to have been\r\nsufficiently abundant to furnish material for coal-beds was the\r\nCarboniferous period. Although a similar flora existed during the\r\npreceding period, the Devonian, no coal-beds of workable thickness are\r\nknown in the rocks of that age. Since the Carboniferous period coal has\r\nbeen found at many horizons in the sedimentary rocks, and peat is being\r\naccumulated at the present day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Map showing the distribution of coal in North\r\nAmerica.]\r\n\r\nThe coal-fields of North America are more extensive than those of any\r\nother continent, excepting, perhaps, the at present but little known\r\ncoal-bearing formations of Asia, and are distributed in temperate\r\nlatitudes, from tide-water on the Atlantic to tide-water on the Pacific\r\ncoasts, where the greatest commercial and intellectual development has\r\nbeen reached.\r\n\r\nCoal of Carboniferous age occurs in large and valuable deposits in Nova\r\nScotia and New Brunswick; there is a small area of graphitic anthracite,\r\nnot now utilized, in Rhode Island; but the great fields are in\r\nPennsylvania and the States southward to central Alabama, and westward\r\nto beyond the Mississippi. A detached coal-basin containing some 6,700\r\nsquare miles, but a small part of which is productive, however, occurs\r\nin the central part of southern Michigan. Small coal-fields in Virginia\r\nand North Carolina, the first to be worked in America, are of Jura-Trias\r\nage and form part of the Newark system. Extensive fields of valuable\r\ncoal of Mesozoic age, principally in the Laramie system, occur in New\r\nMexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and still farther north along the\r\nsame great belt in Canada.\r\n\r\nAnother highly valuable field of Mesozoic coal is now being extensively\r\nworked on Vancouver Island. The coals of the west side of the\r\nPacific mountains, largely lignites, but in many instances of high grade\r\nand serviceable for steam coal, are mostly of Cenozoic age (Tertiary)\r\nand occur in California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. The\r\ndistribution of the various coal-fields is indicated on the above map,\r\nand space will not be taken in describing their geographical relations.\r\n\r\nPeat is present in innumerable swamps throughout the humid, temperate\r\nportion of the continent, especially from Louisiana and Florida\r\nnorthward, to the region about the Great Lakes and widely throughout\r\nCanada, but is at present of small commercial importance, although steps\r\nare being taken for its extensive utilization.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable of the coal deposits are of Carboniferous age, and lie\r\nto the east of the Rocky Mountains. The most of the coal is bituminous,\r\nor soft coal, used principally in generating steam and for manufacturing\r\ngas and coke. The exceptions occur in eastern Pennsylvania and in Rhode\r\nIsland. These are considered as metamorphosed coals, although in the\r\nPennsylvania region there is no evidence of the action of a high degree\r\nof heat. In the Rhode Island field the rocks associated with the coal\r\nare plainly metamorphic in character, and the coal has, in large part,\r\nbeen changed to graphitic anthracite.\r\n\r\nThat anthracite may be of any age, however, is indicated by the local\r\nchanges that have occurred in Mesozoic and Cenozoic coals, where they\r\nhave been penetrated by dikes and other varieties of intrusions, or have\r\nbeen altered by surface lava-flows. In such situations the coal has lost\r\nnearly all its volatile matter, and in composition and in certain\r\ninstances, as in western Colorado, in physical character as well, is\r\nessentially an anthracite.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the various coal deposits referred to above there is a\r\nsecond series of organic compounds found stored in sedimentary rocks\r\nwhich consists of hydrocarbon. This series of substances includes\r\nnatural or rock-gas, petroleum, maltha or semifluid hydrocarbon, and\r\nsolid hydrocarbons, such as asphaltum, albertite, grahamite,\r\nozokerite, etc. These substances are usually considered as being of\r\norganic origin and to have resulted from changes which take place in\r\nvegetable and animal tissues when buried and in most cases subjected to\r\nheavy pressure. A large part of the hydrocarbons referred to is thought\r\nto have been derived from animal organisms, an opinion which is\r\nsustained in an important manner by the fact that large stores of both\r\npetroleum and rock-gas have been discovered in rocks which were laid\r\ndown before land vegetation is known to have existed. Marine algae were\r\npresent, however, so that it cannot be affirmed that the hydrocarbon of\r\nthe earlier Paleozoic rocks came entirely from animal organisms. It is\r\nhighly probable, however, that a large portion of the hydrocarbons\r\nstored in Paleozoic and later strata was derived from the animals whose\r\nhard parts occur so abundantly as fossils in the same or adjacent beds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Ideal section showing favourable conditions for\r\nthe storage of petroleum and gas.]\r\n\r\nBesides the concentration of carbon in plant and animal tissues and its\r\nchange to hydrocarbons, there is a still further concentration necessary\r\nin order that stores of petroleum, gas, etc., shall be accumulated so as\r\nto be of economic value. This accumulation is dependent largely on\r\nphysical conditions. The production of hydrocarbons from organic matter\r\ncontained in sedimentary rocks, and particularly in shale, is going on\r\nin many regions, and probably nearly everywhere, especially when the\r\nsoft parts of animals are buried in the rocks, but the petroleum, gas,\r\netc., generated escape at the surface and pass into the air and are\r\nagain widely disseminated, unless conditions are present which lead to\r\ntheir accumulation. The conditions favouring the natural storage of the\r\nsubstances referred to are cavities, or more usually porous beds, such\r\nas sandstone, beneath impervious beds, such as clay or shale. The\r\nconditions are still more favourable when lateral as well as vertical\r\nescape is cut off, as, for example, when arches or domes occur. The most\r\nfavourable conditions result when a bed of shale or other rock, as _a_,\r\nFig. 35, from which hydrocarbons are being evolved occur beneath a sheet\r\nof porous sandstone or fissured rock of any kind, _b_, above which there\r\nis a close-textured, unfractured stratum, such as shale, _c_, and the\r\nseries is bent along certain axes into upward folds or anticlinals.\r\nUnder these conditions, as extended experience has shown, a well drilled\r\nat _d_ should yield in succession gas, petroleum, and water.\r\n\r\nThe conditions for the production of petroleum, gas, etc., have been\r\npresent on the earth since the first appearance of life, and reservoirs\r\nmay have originated at any subsequent time. The oldest known reservoirs\r\nstill charged with these substances that have been discovered occur in\r\nthe earlier Paleozoic rocks, just above the formations containing the\r\noldest known fauna. Important petroleum and gas fields in rocks of the\r\nTrenton period occur in New York, Ontario, Ohio, and Indiana. The\r\nDevonian rocks of Pennsylvania, New York, Ontario, etc., also yield\r\nlarge supplies of both oil and gas. Mesozoic rocks of Colorado, Wyoming,\r\netc., are also rich in the concentrated hydrocarbon referred to, and on\r\nthe Pacific coast, particularly in California, rocks of Cenozoic age are\r\nhighly productive. Petroleum and gas may occur also in rocks more recent\r\nthan the Cenozoic, but owing to the absence of reservoirs, and possibly\r\nthe lack of sufficient time, no important accumulations are known in\r\nbeds more recent than the Tertiary, unless they come from a deeper\r\nsource in older rocks. The vast quantity of petroleum stored in the\r\nrocks of various ages in North America is indicated by the fact that in\r\n1900 the yield from the wells of the United States was 63,362,704\r\nbarrels, and from Canadian wells about 280,000 barrels, making a total\r\nof nearly 64,000,000 barrels.\r\n\r\nThe stores of rock-gas are also enormous, as is indicated by the fact\r\nthat a single well at Bairdstown, Ohio, yielded over 17,000,000\r\ncubic feet per day. In 1890 the average daily flow of the Indiana\r\ngas-wells was 779,525,000 cubic feet. The value of the natural gas\r\nconsumed in the United States in 1900 was $23,606,463.\r\n\r\nIn the sedimentary rocks of North America there occur also extensive and\r\nvaluable deposits of semifluid and solid hydrocarbons, such as maltha,\r\nasphaltum, albertite, grahamite, uintahite, etc., which have arisen,\r\nunder the most plausible explanation thus far offered, from the\r\nconcentration by evaporation of fluid hydrocarbons such as petroleum.\r\nThe evaporation, particularly of heavy petroleum, leads to the formation\r\nof a solid residue, similar to asphaltum. In fact, there is no definite\r\nboundary between the lightest naphtha and the most coal-like asphaltum.\r\nThey form a connected hydrocarbon series, analogous to the coal series.\r\n\r\nAlbertite, a bright, coal-like substance, exceedingly rich in volatile\r\nhydrocarbon, occupies fissures in Carboniferous rocks in Nova Scotia,\r\nand a similar but less lustrous mineral, termed grahamite, occurs in\r\nfissures in rock of the same age, near a rich oil-pool in West Virginia.\r\nOther similar deposits, but usually wax-like and dull, are found in Utah\r\nand neighbouring States. Asphaltum occurs in vast quantities in southern\r\nCalifornia, and also in Cuba; these deposits resemble the celebrated\r\nasphaltum of Trinidad and give promise of being fully as extensive and\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nIn brief, gaseous, fluid, semifluid, and solid hydrocarbons in great\r\nvariety are widely distributed throughout the portions of North America\r\nwhere the surface is composed of sedimentary beds, and in a few\r\ninstances occur in cavities in igneous rocks as well.\r\n\r\nThe influence of life in leading to the concentration of substances of\r\ncommercial value is still further illustrated by the beds of\r\ndiatomaceous earth which are found in various portions of North America\r\nand elsewhere, particularly in Cenozoic and more recent terranes. Beds\r\nof diatomaceous earth reported to be 40 feet thick and of wide extent\r\nhave been found near Richmond, Virginia, and similar deposits occur at\r\nseveral localities in Oregon, California, etc. The uses of this fine,\r\nwhite, flour-like powder, each minute grain of which is a\r\nbeautiful siliceous organism, are for polishing powder, as an ingredient\r\nin friction soap, as an absorbent for nitroglycerine in the manufacture\r\nof high explosives, etc.\r\n\r\nA class of substances of economic importance which owe their\r\naccumulation to chemical agencies acting at the surface of the earth is\r\nwell illustrated by deposits of rock salt and gypsum.\r\n\r\nIn the Silurian system in New York, Ontario, Michigan, etc., several\r\nbeds of rock salt and gypsum occur, indicating that there were formerly\r\na number of separate evaporating basins in that region. The beds of salt\r\nvary in thickness from a few inches to over 300 feet, as at Tulley, New\r\nYork. At Goodrich, Ontario, 6 beds of salt from 6 to 35 feet thick have\r\nbeen penetrated in a single well. With the salt in this the Salina\r\nformation there are many beds of gypsum. In rocks of Carboniferous age\r\nin Michigan, other extensive beds of salt and gypsum have been\r\ndiscovered. In Louisiana, Texas, Utah, and other States, salt and gypsum\r\noccur in Mesozoic and Cenozoic rocks. One of the most remarkable of\r\nthese deposits is beneath small islands in the Gulf of Mexico off the\r\nLouisiana coast. On Jefferson Island, for example, rock salt was reached\r\nrecently at a depth of 260 feet beneath Cenozoic rock, and was\r\npenetrated for over 1,800 feet without reaching the base of the deposit.\r\nThe supply of salt stored in the rocks, and the natural brines of the\r\narid region, such as the waters of Great Salt Lake, afford an\r\ninexhaustible supply upon which comparatively small demands have thus\r\nfar been made.\r\n\r\nIn addition to salt and gypsum there are other substances that have been\r\naccumulated in a similar manner, such, for example, as sodium sulphate,\r\nof which large beds occur in the desiccated lake basins of the arid\r\nregion, sodium bromide, which is obtained from some of the ancient\r\nbrines pumped from deep wells in Michigan.\r\n\r\nNext to the fossil fuels, the most important products of the rocks in\r\nNorth America are the iron ores. Although certain igneous rocks are rich\r\nin iron, and in some instances contain it even in a pure or\r\nmetallic state, none of the rocks that have cooled from fusion carry\r\niron in any form in sufficient quantities to be of commercial\r\nimportance. Most of the iron in igneous rocks is contained in mineral,\r\nusually silicates, and would be difficult to separate. When exposed to\r\nthe air and to percolating water, the iron-bearing minerals of the\r\nigneous or other rocks decay and the iron enters into various new\r\ncombinations. When organic acids are present, and especially carbon\r\ndioxide, ferrous carbonate is formed, which is quite soluble, and is\r\ntaken into solution by percolating water, some of which emerges as\r\nsprings, and joins the surface run-off, which may also take up ferrous\r\ncarbonate in solution. One of the most common methods by which iron ore\r\nis accumulated is when water carrying ferrous carbonate in solution\r\nforms swamps and lakes, and in many instances as the water is exposed to\r\nthe air and aided by evaporation it parts with a portion of its carbon\r\ndioxide, and the hydrated sesquioxide of iron or limonite results. When,\r\nunder similar conditions, an excess of organic matter is present, beds\r\nof ferrous carbonate are formed. In other instances iron oxide is\r\nprecipitated in swamps and lakes through the action of low forms of\r\nplant life. The ores of iron concentrated in these ways are in many\r\ninstances in well-defined layers, or lenticular bodies, which are\r\nthickest in the central portion and thin out in all directions. Their\r\nforms are determined mainly by the shapes of the depressions they\r\noccupy. Both ferrous carbonate and limonite, however, occur in irregular\r\nsurface deposits.\r\n\r\nIn North America, bog-iron ores occur at the surface in many regions, in\r\nexisting swamps and about springs, but are seldom of economic\r\nimportance, owing in part to the great abundance of better ores.\r\nLimonite occurs at the surface also, having been deposited in cavities\r\nand as a cement for loose fragments, particularly on the weathered\r\noutcrops of formations rich in iron. When rocks contain but a fraction\r\nof 1 per cent of iron, the soil on their weathered outcrops, owing to\r\nthe removal of the more soluble ingredients and the leaving of the less\r\nsoluble oxidized iron, have a yellow, brown, or red colour, and\r\nin some instances this process of concentration has produced workable\r\niron ore. Limonite and earthy hematites occur widely throughout the\r\nAppalachian region, in central New York, and westward to the Mississippi\r\nValley. One of the most productive formations is the Clinton, a division\r\nof the Silurian, the outcrop of which extends in a nearly continuous\r\nband from Alabama, where at Birmingham, etc., it is extensively worked,\r\nnorthward along the west side of the Appalachians to central New York,\r\nand thence westward to Ohio, and appears again in Wisconsin. At many\r\nlocalities throughout this belt, some 1,300 miles in length, iron\r\nfurnaces have been built, although now mostly abandoned, the ore supply\r\nbeing the weathered outcrop of the Clinton limestone.\r\n\r\nIn the Carboniferous rocks of Pennsylvania and neighbouring States to\r\nthe south and west, layers of ferrous carbonate, formed when there was\r\nan excess of organic matter present, termed black-band ore and kidney\r\nore, occur. The former is present as regular strata and the latter in\r\noval concretionary masses. These ores, although not as rich in iron and\r\nless pure than certain other and more abundant and more accessible\r\ndeposits, have been extensively utilized, largely for the reason that\r\nthey occur in the same formation which furnishes coal available for\r\ntheir reduction.\r\n\r\nDeposits of iron ore accumulated in the several ways referred to above\r\nmay be metamorphosed and changed to hematite and magnetite. The richest\r\niron ores of North America are of this nature, and will be referred to\r\nbelow in connection with other substances of economic importance\r\ncontained in the metamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\nThere are various other substances in the stratified rocks of North\r\nAmerica of economic importance which owe their value to some process of\r\nconcentration. Certain rocks, as the so-called greensands or marls of\r\neastern New Jersey, contain from 3 to 10 per cent of potash, which makes\r\nthem valuable fertilizers. In this instance the concentration took place\r\non the floor of the sea, through the action of decomposing\r\norganic matter, and the potash-bearing mineral of the greensand, namely,\r\nglauconite, was deposited in the interiors of the minute tests of\r\nforaminifera. The importance of this material is indicated by the fact\r\nthat the greensands of New Jersey have been actively worked for more\r\nthan half a century, the annual products during many years being upward\r\nof 100,000 tons.\r\n\r\nExtensive areas in the Carolinas, Florida, etc., underlaid by rocks of\r\nCenozoic age, are rich in phosphatic nodules, which have been derived\r\nfrom organic matter. The guano deposits of the low arid islands in the\r\nWest Indies illustrate another mode of accumulation of organic material\r\nuseful as a fertilizer.\r\n\r\nThe assorting of surface _debris_ by streams and currents has led to the\r\nformation of extensive deposits of clay which occur widely throughout\r\nthe portions of North America where the surface is composed of\r\nstratified rock, which is extensively used in the manufacture of\r\nearthenware, bricks, tiles, terra-cotta, Portland cement, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen rocks containing gold in nuggets, grains, scales, etc., are\r\ndisintegrated, and the resulting _debris_ removed by streams, mechanical\r\nseparation of the heavier from the lighter material takes place and all\r\nbut the very finest of the gold is concentrated on the stream beds. In\r\nthis manner the rich placers of the Pacific mountain region from\r\nCalifornia to Alaska have originated.\r\n\r\nThe general nature of the ore bodies formed through the action of\r\nchemical agencies in sedimentary rocks, by solution and redeposition, is\r\nillustrated by the lead and zinc ores of Wisconsin, Missouri, the\r\nsilver-bearing lodes of the Pacific mountains, etc. In the case of the\r\nlead and zinc deposits the ores occupy the interspaces between broken\r\nsedimentary beds or line caverns. Under the best explanation of the\r\norigin of these deposits that has been offered, although certain\r\nmodifications of the general hypothesis have been suggested which it is\r\nnot necessary to consider at length at this time, the lead and zinc are\r\nconsidered to have been at one time widely distributed in the adjacent\r\nsedimentary rocks, mainly limestone, and to have been taken in\r\nsolution by percolating waters and carried to cavities where they were\r\nprecipitated, together with various other mineral substances, such as\r\ncalcium carbonate or calcite, barium sulphate or barite, carbonate of\r\ncalcium and magnesium or dolomite, etc. The minerals containing lead are\r\nprincipally galenite or lead sulphate, cerussite or lead carbonate;\r\nwhile the zinc is contained in the minerals, sphalerite or zinc\r\nsulphide, calamine or zinc silicate, smithsonite or zinc carbonate, etc.\r\nThese minerals, including both those containing lead and zinc, and those\r\nintimately associated with them which are at present of no commercial\r\nvalue, are such as are known to crystallize from solution without the\r\naid of high temperatures. In the Missouri lead and zinc districts the\r\nore deposits occur near the surface, the depth of the present working\r\nseldom exceeding 150 or 200 feet, and, as nearly as can be judged, have\r\nbeen formed by the downward transfer of mineral matter through the\r\nprocess of solution and recrystallization, as the surface of the land\r\nhas been lowered by chemical and mechanical denudation.\r\n\r\nMany of the rich silver-mines of the Pacific mountains occur in fissures\r\nand cavities in sedimentary rocks, mainly limestone. Instances of this\r\nnature are furnished by certain mines in northeastern Mexico, where the\r\nore is found in cavities in Cretaceous limestone; at Leadville and\r\nAspen, Colorado; Big and Little Cottonwood canyons, and the Horn\r\nsilver-mine, Utah, where the principal country rock is Carboniferous\r\nlimestone; the Eureka district, Nevada, where the ore occurs in cavities\r\nin Cambrian limestone. In the case of several of these mines, igneous\r\nrock is near at hand, and the ores are believed to owe their\r\nconcentration largely to the action of heated waters.\r\n\r\nIn other regions deep fissures, occupied in part by dikes of igneous\r\nrock, have permitted of the ascent of water charged with mineral matter\r\nfrom far below the surface; such waters are heated, in part by the\r\ngeneral heat of the earth's interior, or, if in association with dikes,\r\nby the heat of the once molten intruded rock. The ascending hot water is\r\nan active solvent, and as it rises becomes cooled, and for this\r\nand other reasons precipitates many mineral substances. Veins are thus\r\nformed, which are many times banded--that is, result from the filling of\r\nfissures by the successive deposition of minerals of various kinds on\r\ntheir walls, each different layer of minerals indicating a change in\r\nconditions. Fissures filled in this manner from below, as denudation\r\nprogresses, become exposed at the surface and reconcentration through\r\nthe influence of disintegration and decay, and of solution and\r\nredeposition by descending water takes place. Ore bodies of this\r\ncharacter carrying gold, silver, mercury, etc., are of wide occurrence,\r\nespecially in the Pacific mountains, but the process of concentration is\r\nindependent of the nature of the country rock. Segregated and fissure\r\nveins occur in either igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic terranes, but\r\nare more commonly of economic importance in the metamorphic rocks than\r\nelsewhere, and will be referred to again in that connection.\r\n\r\n_Economic Importance of the Metamorphic Terranes._--The great laboratory\r\nin which rocks undergo important changes in their physical condition and\r\nin mineralogical and chemical composition, is what has been termed on a\r\nprevious page the zone of metamorphism. The depth of the upper limit of\r\nthis zone is variable, dependent in part on the nature of the rocks and\r\non movements within them, as is the case of mountain building. In fact,\r\nthere is probably no well-defined limit to the zone either above or\r\nbelow, as in the former direction metamorphism merges by gradations into\r\nalteration produced by the descent of surface water, and in the latter\r\ndirection as heat increases passes again, as we imagine, by insensible\r\nand irregular gradations into a region where the rocks are so highly\r\nheated that diffusion rather than concentration results. Whether the\r\nrocks below the zone of metamorphism are fused or not depends on\r\npressure. They are probably solid, but in a potentially plastic\r\ncondition, and become fused and may be forced upward through fissures in\r\nthe condition of igneous magmas when pressure is relieved. The zone of\r\nmetamorphism lies between a superior zone where alteration by\r\ndescending water is dominant, and a lower region where alteration due\r\nmainly to heat is in control. In the zone of metamorphism the influence\r\nof heated percolating waters, combined with movements in the rocks, are\r\nthe principal factors which lead to the concentration of mineral\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of percolating, heated waters, new minerals are\r\nformed in sedimentary or igneous rocks, and rocks once metamorphosed may\r\nundergo additional changes. Mineral matter previously widely\r\ndisseminated through rocks is, under the action of percolating, heated\r\nwater, brought together and the regeneration and crystallization of a\r\nlarge variety of ores and minerals result. The birthplace of a large\r\nvariety of ores and minerals is in the zone of metamorphism. It is in\r\nmetamorphic rocks that the geologist looks for gems, the precious\r\nmetals, crystalline marble, magnetic iron, etc.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, however, the native metals and ores of the precious\r\nand many of the common metals are too widely disseminated in the\r\nmetamorphic rocks to be of commercial importance, and a still further\r\nconcentration, principally in fissures and other cavities, is necessary\r\nbefore they can be of value to man. This secondary concentration is much\r\nthe same as in the case of the deposition of lead and zinc ores in\r\ncavities in sedimentary rocks, and results largely from the solution and\r\nredeposition, sometimes by replacement, of mineral matter by heated\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nCertain ores and rocks contained in metamorphic terranes owe their\r\nconcentration to previously acting processes of concentration, but have\r\nundergone chemical changes in place. Illustrations of this class of\r\nores, etc., are furnished by the magnetite and hematite contained in the\r\nmetamorphic rocks on the eastern border of the Appalachians, in New\r\nEngland, eastern Canada, and the Lake Superior region. These ore bodies,\r\nfrequently of great size, in some instances furnish evidence of having\r\nbeen originally lenticular masses of bog-iron ore, or ferric carbonate,\r\nassociated with sedimentary beds, and originally concentrated, as\r\nalready mentioned, at the surface through the action of water charged\r\nwith carbon dioxide, but principally on account of the influence of heat\r\nhave been changed to a higher degree of oxidation and now appear as\r\nhematite, as, for example, in the iron districts of the northern\r\nportions of Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the Ozark Hills, or\r\nstill further altered as in the richest of all iron ores, magnetite, so\r\nabundant in the metamorphic rocks of the Appalachian region, about the\r\nAdirondack hills, widely and in extensive bodies in eastern Canada,\r\nabout the south shore of Lake Superior, in Texas, etc.\r\n\r\nIn certain instances, as has been shown by C. R. Van Hise and others,\r\nhematite ore, like that of the Lake Superior region, has resulted from\r\nthe alteration of ferrous carbonate which had replaced limestone by a\r\nchemical process of solution and double decomposition.\r\n\r\nAs bodies of iron ore in the form of the carbonate, or limonite, may\r\noccur in rocks of any age, and as rocks of any age may be metamorphosed,\r\nit follows that hematite and magnetite may be present in any formation\r\nwhich has been subjected to metamorphosing conditions.\r\n\r\nLimestone when metamorphosed is changed to a crystalline marble,\r\nfrequently white in colour owing to the dissipation of its previously\r\ncontained organic matter. The white marbles so extensively utilized in\r\nGeorgia, Vermont, etc., are of this nature. Other similar metamorphosed\r\nlayers occur in several of the ranges of the Pacific mountains from\r\nMexico to Alaska.\r\n\r\nThe influence of metamorphism on deposits of coal when the heat has been\r\nof moderate intensity serves to drive off a large part of the volatile\r\nmatter present and converts the coal into a substance resembling coke,\r\nas has happened adjacent to dikes or intruded sheets of igneous rock in\r\nthe Richmond coal-field, Virginia, in New Mexico, Washington, etc. When\r\nthe heat is somewhat more intense, the coal is changed to what is termed\r\ngraphitic anthracite, as in the Rhode Island coal-fields, and when still\r\ngreater or long-continued, results in the production of graphite,\r\nas in the Algonkian rocks about the Adirondack hills and over a wide\r\nregion in eastern Canada.\r\n\r\nAn important result of metamorphism is the production of new minerals in\r\nthe rocks acted on. Many of the metamorphic terranes consist essentially\r\nof quartz, feldspar, and mica, which have been formed by the\r\nrearrangement of the mineral matter contained in the rocks during their\r\nprevious state. Besides these constituent minerals there are frequently\r\nothers present, such as the garnets, tourmaline, emerald, sapphire,\r\ncorundum, etc., which are of economic importance. In a large number of\r\ninstances the minerals of metamorphic rocks are contained in veins of\r\none class or another, in part resulting from segregation in the rocks\r\nthemselves while yet in a heated condition, and in part deposited in\r\nfissures or other openings as a result of secondary concentration\r\nthrough the action of heated waters. The principal difference between\r\nthe minerals concentrated in the metamorphic rocks and those deposited\r\nin cavities in unaltered sedimentary beds seems to be that in the former\r\ninstance the percolating water which carried the material in solution\r\nhad a higher temperature than in the latter case.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous mineral substances of value in the arts, occurring in\r\nthe metamorphic terranes of North America, other than building stones\r\nand the previously concentrated deposits, such as iron ore, graphite,\r\netc., mention can only be made at present of the following:\r\n\r\nMica, which is used in thin sheets for the windows of stoves and\r\nfurnaces, and when ground and mingled with other substances furnishes a\r\ngood insulating material for electric wires, fireproofing, and also used\r\nas a lubricant, etc., occurs in large quantities in the metamorphic\r\nrocks of New Hampshire and Ottawa, and less abundantly in North\r\nCarolina, South Dakota, Wyoming, Idaho, etc. It is widely distributed,\r\nbut to find transparent colourless sheets of large size is difficult.\r\n\r\nTalc and soapstone, consisting of the hydrated silicate of magnesia, and\r\nuseful for hearths, mantels, fire-brick, linings for stoves, laundry-,\r\nbath-, and acid-tubs, etc., and when ground, employed as an\r\nadulterant of soap, paper, rubber, and as a lubricant, etc., occurs\r\nwidely in the metamorphic terranes on the eastern side of the\r\nAppalachians, in Canada, and at numerous localities in the Pacific\r\nmountains. The chief centres of production at present are in\r\nPennsylvania, New Jersey, New Hampshire, and Vermont.\r\n\r\nAsbestos, valuable on account of its fibrous structure and\r\nnon-conductivity of heat, which make it an excellent insulator, and\r\nlargely used in the manufacture of fireproof paper, cloth, etc., occurs\r\nin connection with serpentine, in metamorphic terranes, and is\r\nextensively mined in the Thetford district, Quebec.\r\n\r\nCorundum, consisting of aluminum oxide, and having essentially the same\r\ncomposition as the sapphire and ruby, and a less pure variety of similar\r\ncomposition termed emery, is largely used as an abrasive in polishing\r\nmetal, sharpening tools, etc., and also as \"sand-paper\" in working wood,\r\noccurs in commercial quantities, largely in crystalline limestone, at\r\nChester, Mass., in Georgia, North Carolina, and several other\r\nlocalities. Although corundum is next to the diamond in hardness, and\r\ntherefore highly favourable, when reduced to a powder, for polishing\r\nvarious substances, the demand for it has in recent years been\r\ndiminished owing to the manufacture of an equally if not superior\r\nmaterial termed commercially _carborundum_.\r\n\r\nAmong the crystals used as gems, which occur in the metamorphic rocks of\r\nNorth America but thus far in minor quantities, and as a rule of\r\ninferior quality, may be enumerated sapphires, rubies, tourmalines,\r\ngarnets, quartz, etc.\r\n\r\nApatite, a mineral rich in phosphoric acid, and largely used in the\r\nmanufacture of fertilizers, occurs associated with limestone in the\r\nmetamorphic rocks of Quebec and Ontario in the form of veins, beds, and\r\nirregular pockets, and a few years since was extensively mined, but now,\r\nowing to foreign competition, is held in reserve.\r\n\r\nBy far the most valuable of the minerals and native metals that occur in\r\nthe metamorphosed terranes is gold. Although this metal has been found\r\nin paying quantities in association with nearly every kind of\r\ncountry rocks and in terranes of all ages, the place of its original\r\nconcentration from a previously widely disseminated condition is to a\r\ngreat extent in the zone of metamorphism. It occurs principally as\r\nnative gold, although usually alloyed with silver, but is frequently\r\ncontained in iron pyrites. In the crystalline rocks, such as gneiss,\r\nschist, slates, granite, etc., it occurs in flakes and grains, but so\r\nfar as its occurrence in commercial quantities is concerned its\r\ndeposition has for the most part been secondary, and the metal, usually\r\nin association with quartz, is found in veins, lodes, contact deposits,\r\netc., and owes its concentration to chemical agencies not well\r\nunderstood, acting in connection with percolating water. That this\r\ngeneral statement is correct is clearly shown by the fact that gold\r\noccurs in crystals, flakes, grains, etc., most frequently in quartz and\r\niron pyrites, which, as can be shown in a number of ways, have\r\ncrystallized from solution. The gold and its commonly associated mineral\r\nin countless instances occupy fissures and must have been carried to\r\nsuch localities after the surrounding rock had been fractured. So\r\nintimate is the association of gold with metamorphic rocks that this is\r\none of the main guides in searching for it, although, as already stated,\r\nit is frequently present in other rocks as well. With the disintegration\r\nof the metamorphic terranes the gold is set free, and may be still\r\nfurther concentrated by streams so as to form the well-known placers.\r\n\r\nA very large proportion of both the quartz and placer mining of North\r\nAmerica is in regions occupied by metamorphic rock. This is true of all\r\ngold-mines, previously quite largely exploited, of the Atlantic mountain\r\nregion from Georgia to eastern Canada. The mines of California are also\r\nlargely in schistose rocks, as are also those to the northward,\r\nthroughout the Pacific mountains, to British Columbia and Alaska,\r\nincluding the recently established mining district at Cape Nome.\r\n\r\nWith placer gold, and probably derived largely, if not entirely, from\r\nmetamorphic rocks, there are frequently found grains of platinum. The\r\nannual production of this metal in the United States and Canada\r\nhas a value of about $5,000.\r\n\r\nThe study of the distribution of native metals and ores in the\r\nmetamorphic rocks of North America indicates that in general the older\r\nrocks, as the Archean, for example, are less rich than the younger\r\nterranes, such as the schist, etc., of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade\r\nMountains. This seems to indicate that the older rocks were once deeply\r\nburied and their more soluble substances removed by ascending waters,\r\nand in part redeposited in higher terranes. Erosion has since carried\r\noff the rocks which were mineral-charged and laid bare the depleted\r\nterranes beneath. This hypothetical explanation of the general poverty\r\nof the Archean rocks is coupled with another consideration, namely, that\r\nthe younger metamorphic terranes, where they have been elevated, as in\r\nthe Pacific mountains, are more broken than the Archean rocks, and\r\nafford more cavities in which minerals may be deposited. Whether this is\r\na complete explanation or not remains to be demonstrated, but\r\nobservation shows that the Archean terranes--all of which as yet\r\ndiscovered are composed of either metamorphosed or igneous rocks--are,\r\nin comparison with younger metamorphosed rocks, relatively poor in\r\nminerals and ores of commercial importance.\r\n\r\nAmong the economic products of the rocks are included mineral waters.\r\nThe direct commercial value of such waters, not including their use for\r\nbaths, etc., in the United States, is about $7,000,000 annually. The\r\ndemand for these waters depends largely on the mineral substances they\r\nhold in solution, and which in many instances is in process of\r\ntransference from one locality to another. Much might be written in this\r\nconnection in illustration of the fact that the processes by which\r\nminerals, ores, etc., have been concentrated are still in progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LITERATURE\r\n\r\nAn extensive literature is available concerning the geology, minerals,\r\nores, etc., of North America, but only a few of the more important\r\npublications can here be referred to.

The aborigines were distributed principally along the coast,\r\nabout the borders of lakes, and on the margins of streams, but much of\r\nthe interior was also inhabited or roamed over by hunting and war\r\nparties, or crossed by various tribes during their migrations. Large\r\nareas, it is true, more especially among the rugged mountains, in the\r\ngreat subarctic forest, and on the trackless tundras, had no permanent\r\nresidents, but in general terms the entire land was inhabited.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the reports as to the density of the aboriginal population\r\nmade by several early explorers, who for the most part followed the\r\nwaterways, visited the most thickly inhabited regions, and saw the\r\nnatives when brought together by motives of curiosity or defence, it is\r\nnow known that North America, considering its vast extent, was but\r\nsparsely peopled. As to the number of the inhabitants, there is no even\r\napproximately accurate knowledge. The greatest density of population, so\r\nfar as can be judged, was in the tropical region, and decreased\r\nnorthward in a general way in conformity with change in latitude, but\r\nvaried also in a conspicuous manner in accord with local climatic and\r\ntopographic influences.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner as the exploration of the New World led to the\r\ndiscovery of many species, genera, etc., of plants and animals, it also\r\nadded two types of man to those previously known to Europeans. The\r\npropriety of separating the American aborigines into two groups of\r\ntribes is based on the contrasts the members of these divisions\r\npresent not only in colour and other physiological characteristics, but\r\non well-marked differences in language, customs, arts, etc. On this\r\nbasis two varieties of the human species have been recognised, namely,\r\nthe Eskimo and the Indian.\r\n\r\nThe term Eskimo, formerly spelled Esquimau, is of obscure origin, but is\r\nthought to have been adopted by Europeans from the Indians of Labrador,\r\nwho thus designated a northern people living on the coast, and is said\r\nto mean \"raw-flesh eaters.\" The word in use among the Eskimos to\r\ndesignate themselves is _Innuit_, meaning people, or the people, in the\r\nsense that in their own estimation they are of more importance than all\r\nother peoples.\r\n\r\nThe term Indian, as is well known, arose from an error of the early\r\nSpanish voyagers, who, on arriving in America, believed they had reached\r\nIndia, and hence termed the natives of the new land Indians. This\r\nmistake has led to many attempts to substitute some other word by which\r\nto designate the people referred to, but thus far none of the terms\r\nproposed has been generally accepted. In the present book the word\r\nIndian is used to designate the aborigines of the New World, exclusive\r\nof the Eskimos.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of the Eskimos and Indians is sharply\r\ndefined even at the present day, and is indicated on the map forming\r\nPlate VI.\r\n\r\n_Origin of the Aborigines._--The generally accepted conclusion in\r\nreference to the origin of the American aborigines seems to be that man\r\nreached this continent while the peoples of the Old World were yet in a\r\nprimitive condition, and at a time when the highest stage of culture was\r\nexpressed by the knife and spear-point of chipped stone, and developed\r\nindependently in accord with the natural conditions with which he was\r\nsurrounded. More than this, once planted, the original stock received\r\nbut slight if any accessions by subsequent immigration. This last\r\nstatement is not in strict accord with the conclusions reached by\r\ncertain ethnologists, who claim that the use of masks, the art of\r\ncarving on wood, stone, ivory, etc., the practise of tattooing, the\r\npreservation of human heads, and other customs practised by the Indians\r\nof the Pacific coast of the two Americas--and in North America,\r\nextending eastward along lines of easiest communication--suggest an\r\ninfluence coming from Polynesia at a time when the peoples dwelling on\r\nthe west borders of the Pacific had made a well-marked advance in\r\nculture. Some influences on the aborigines of America coming both from\r\nPolynesia and eastern Asia must seemingly be admitted, the importations\r\nhaving been by means of storm- and current-swept boats and junks, but\r\nthe evidence does not point to trade relations. The most that can be\r\nclaimed seems to be slight modifications of the arts and customs of the\r\nAmerican aborigines, but not enough to make what may be termed an\r\nindelible impression upon them.\r\n\r\nThe low state of culture of the original stock from which the American\r\naborigines were derived, implied in their distinct subsequent\r\ndevelopment in language, arts, etc., indicates that man appeared in\r\nAmerica previous to the invention of boats capable of crossing broad\r\noceans. The necessary inference from this--if the hypothesis of one\r\nplace of origin for the human race is accepted--is that migration to\r\nAmerica was by land, or at most across narrow straits. The geography of\r\nthe continents must have been markedly different from what it is at\r\npresent to admit of this, providing the proof that access was not gained\r\nwhere Asia and America make a near approach to each other at Bering\r\nStrait is conclusive, and at present that evidence seems unquestionable.\r\n\r\nThe present state of opinion in reference to the origin of the American\r\naborigines is thus expressed by one well qualified to speak with\r\nauthority. At the close of a review of several lines of evidence J. W.\r\nPowell says:\r\n\r\n\"Thus we are forced to conclude that the occupancy of America by mankind\r\nwas anterior to the development of arts, industries, institutions,\r\nlanguages, and opinions; that the primordial occupancy of the continent\r\nantedates present geographical conditions, and points to a remote time\r\nwhich can be discovered only on geological and biological\r\ninvestigation.\"\r\n\r\n_Antiquity of the Aborigines._--The conclusions to be drawn from the\r\nstudies of ethnologists in reference to the length of time man\r\nhas made his home in America are qualitative, not quantitative. The time\r\nis certainly long, probably embracing tens of centuries; but how long no\r\none can state in years. This claim for a great although indefinite\r\nantiquity is based on several lines of evidence, some few of which the\r\nreader may find it profitable to briefly consider.\r\n\r\nA comparison of physiological characteristics shows that the American\r\naborigines have well-marked differences from all other varieties of the\r\nhuman race. This conclusion is not based on any one special feature,\r\nalthough colour and character of the hair are the most conspicuous, but\r\non the resultant, so to speak, of many attributes. It is, in a measure,\r\na comparison of ideal type-examples of each variety. While each\r\ncharacteristic that may be chosen has individual and tribal variations,\r\nand but few of them are perhaps conspicuously different from those\r\npertaining to the peoples of the Old World, yet taken together they\r\nclearly differentiate the American aborigines from all other varieties\r\nof the human species.\r\n\r\nApplying the same principles to man that are used in the study of the\r\ngeographical distribution of the lower animals, the only legitimate\r\nconclusion the naturalist can deduce from the evidence just referred to\r\nis that the branch of the human family indigenous to North America has\r\nbeen isolated for a sufficient length of time to develop into a new\r\nvariety. The American aborigines are different from all other varieties\r\nof the human species because each more or less isolated community or\r\ngroup of communities the world over has varied in its own way in accord\r\nwith climatic and other conditions, and the connecting links have been\r\nlost. The differences that have arisen in this manner are so great that\r\nthe nature of the parent stock is no longer determinable from its living\r\nrepresentatives. This process of development among the lower animals is\r\nunderstood to involve a great length of time; and the inference is that\r\nman's development is no exception to the rule.\r\n\r\nThe evidence favouring a great antiquity for the American aborigines is\r\nstrengthened by the fact that when first known to Europeans both North\r\nand South America were inhabited by tribes having more or less\r\nwell-defined territorial limits. If this population spread from one or\r\neven from several centres it is evident that a great length of time\r\nwould be required for it to reach all parts of the New World and to\r\nbecome adjusted to a wide range in climatic and other conditions, as is\r\nknown to be the case.\r\n\r\nStudents of languages have shown that the most enduring characteristics\r\nof man are to be found in his speech. The fundamental principles of a\r\nlanguage outlive not only political and social changes, but even\r\nphysiological distinctions, and are inherited from a primitive stock by\r\nall its branches. We might reasonably expect, therefore, that a study of\r\nthe languages spoken in America in pre-Columbian days would be a sure\r\nindex as to the primitive stock from which the various tribes came, and\r\nshow to which of the many other branches of the linguistic tree they are\r\nmost closely related. Turning with this question to those who have made\r\na critical study of the languages of the American aborigines, and no one\r\nis better qualified to bear testimony in this connection than J. W.\r\nPowell, the honoured director of the American Bureau of Ethnology, we\r\nfind a definite answer. He says:\r\n\r\n\"The North American Indian tribes, instead of speaking related dialects,\r\noriginating in a single parent language, in reality speak many\r\nlanguages, belonging to distinct families, which have no apparent unity\r\nof origin.\"\r\n\r\nTo the north of Mexico (Plate VI) the aborigines are divided into 58\r\nlinguistic families. In a large portion of these languages there are\r\ntribal dialects not understood by members of other tribes of the same\r\nfamily. Thus the Algonquin linguistic family contains some 30 or 40\r\ndistinct languages. In the Athapascan the diversity is nearly as great.\r\nThe smaller families present similar conditions in proportionate degree,\r\nalthough there are stocks which speak but one language. Four of the\r\nlinguistic families referred to extend into Mexico, but to the south of\r\nthe territory occupied by them other languages and dialects are spoken.\r\nEthnologists who have studied the tribes of Mexico report 19 linguistic\r\nstocks, containing 108 distinct languages, among which there are upward\r\nof 60 dialects. In Central America a similar diversity in the\r\nnative tongues exists. Reclus, in his great work The Earth and its\r\nInhabitants, states that in the New World 450 native languages are\r\nspoken--a number greater than that of all the languages in use in the\r\nrest of the earth. Not only are the American linguistic stocks different\r\nfrom each other, and fail to furnish evidence of having been derived\r\nfrom a single parent tongue, but, as philologists assure us, no one of\r\nthem is analogous to any language spoken in other lands.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, a language is not created _de novo_, but by a slow\r\nprocess of development. Since the first acquirement of articulate speech\r\nby man a succession of languages has appeared owing to the growth,\r\ndifferentiation, etc., of pre-existing forms of speech. It is a\r\nwarrantable inference, therefore, that the marvellous diversity in\r\nspeech present in America could only have arisen by a process of\r\nevolution involving a very long period of time.\r\n\r\nAs the American languages have no affinity with the Teutonic or Semitic\r\nstocks, it is evident that the source or sources from which they came\r\nfar antedate the birth of the oldest people of which history takes\r\ncognizance. Man must therefore have set foot on American soil before the\r\nsprouting of the linguistic twig which, after millenniums, produced the\r\ncuneiform inscriptions of ancient Persia and Assyria.\r\n\r\nThe diversity of arts, customs, myths, religions, etc., among the\r\nAmerican aborigines, and their difference in nearly all instances from\r\nthe analogous attributes of the peoples of other lands, also point to a\r\nlong period of isolated development in much the same manner as has been\r\nreferred to in the case of a comparative study of their languages. The\r\nskin boats used by the Eskimos are widely different from the birch-bark\r\ncanoes of the Algonquins, and these again differ conspicuously from the\r\ndug-out canoes of southeastern Alaska and British Columbia; still other\r\nvarieties of boats are peculiar to the more southern Indian tribes, and\r\nall alike differ from the boats used in other lands. Like individuality\r\npertains also to the houses of the American aborigines, their clothing,\r\narms, utensils, basket-work, picture-writings, etc. One is forced to\r\nrecognise in each of these arts or industries not only development in\r\nmany diverging lines among the various tribes, but the birth of ideas\r\nanalogous to those which arose in other lands, and their independent\r\ngrowth under special conditions. All of this, and much more in the same\r\ngeneral direction that might be discussed did space permit, points to a\r\ngreat antiquity for the indigenous American peoples.\r\n\r\nAmong the nations of the Old World certain plants have been under\r\ndomestication for so long a time, and have varied so greatly, that the\r\nwild species from which they came are no longer known. This is true of\r\nnearly all our common fruits and vegetables and many of our flowers that\r\nwere derived from the Old World. At the time of the Spanish conquest the\r\naborigines of America were cultivating tobacco, potatoes, beans,\r\ntomatoes, squashes, maize, cotton, etc., and in the case of most of\r\nthese plants the wild species from which they were derived has not been\r\nascertained. The argument that points to a great antiquity in the case\r\nof wheat and the peach applies equally well to tobacco and maize, and\r\nindicates that horticulture began in America in remote antiquity. At the\r\ntime of Columbus, the ox, sheep, goat, pigeons, fowls, cat, etc., long\r\ndomesticated in the Old, were absent in the New World, and the llama,\r\nturkey, etc., indigenous in America, were unknown in Europe. These\r\nstriking differences, among which there is not even a single exception,\r\namount to positive evidence that contact between the peoples of the Old\r\nand the New World did not occur after the inhabitants of the former\r\nemerged from savagery, or, what is the same thing, never existed in the\r\nsense that trade relations were entered into. This same line of argument\r\nseemingly casts grave doubts on the deductions already referred to\r\nconcerning the importation into America from Polynesia of the practise\r\nof tattooing, the wearing of masks, the use of labrets, etc.; and\r\nindicates also that but slight changes were produced in the American\r\naborigines owing to the wrecking of Asiatic junks on the northwest\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nAnother factor bearing on the antiquity of the indigenous Americans is\r\nthe stage of development reached in spite of their long and nearly\r\ncomplete isolation. Stimuli from without, and particularly\r\ncontact with more advanced peoples, having been lacking or of small\r\nimportance, incentive to bodily and mental activity arose mainly from\r\nthe desire for food, clothing, and shelter, and from intertribal\r\nrivalry, jealousy, and war. This process of indigenous development was\r\ncertainly slow. With man, as with the lower animals, the rate of advance\r\nand of specialization increases as higher and higher grades of\r\ndevelopment are reached. For the American aborigines to have attained\r\nthe higher stages of barbarism at the time of the arrival of civilized\r\nEuropeans, solely by self-growth and self-education, is perhaps even a\r\nstronger argument for their antiquity than their differentiation in\r\nculture, languages, etc.\r\n\r\nThese several lines of evidence point to the coming of man to America as\r\nan event of the far distant past--a time so remote, in fact, that it\r\npertains to geology rather than to ethnology.\r\n\r\nTurning to the geological records, we find no authentic and\r\nwell-attested evidence of the presence of man in America either previous\r\nor during the Glacial period. From time to time so-called \"finds\" of\r\nstone implements in gravel and other deposits more or less definitely\r\ndetermined to be of Glacial age have been made, but in all of these\r\ninstances convincing proof as to the age of the deposits, or of the\r\nrelation of the implements in question, to them, has not been presented.\r\nCertain discoveries of the bones of men and of articles of human\r\nmanufacture found in California have been claimed to be of Tertiary\r\nage--that is, much older than the Glacial epoch--but more critical\r\nstudies, especially by W. H. Holmes, have shown that they are decidedly\r\nmodern and pertain to the Indians still living in the region where they\r\nwere found. In brief, all the geological evidence thus far gathered\r\nbearing on the antiquity of man in America points to the conclusion that\r\nhe came after the Glacial epoch. Judgment in this respect, however,\r\nshould be held in abeyance, as the search for evidence is as yet\r\nincomplete.\r\n\r\nAs the problem now stands, the origin of the American aborigines is not\r\nonly unknown, but no generally accepted or fairly promising\r\nhypothesis as to the land from which they came, the route followed, or\r\nthe date of their arrival is to be found among the large number\r\nsuggested. A continuation of the critical, ethnological, and geological\r\nstudies now in progress, it is hoped, will do much to clear away this\r\nmystery, but at present only small progress can be truthfully reported.\r\n\r\n_Culture of the Aborigines._--In the classification of peoples in terms\r\nof culture three main divisions are commonly recognised, namely,\r\n_savagery_, _barbarism_, and _civilization_; but the boundaries between\r\nthese divisions are not sharply defined and a wide range of intermediate\r\ngradations is easily discernible.\r\n\r\nBy savagery is understood the lowest grade of culture and of ethics, in\r\nwhich social customs are lax or wanting and tribal organization not\r\nattempted. In the condition of savagery people are without permanent\r\nhomes, do not attempt agriculture or even horticulture, have no\r\ndomesticated animals except perhaps the dog, and subsist on fish and\r\ngame, including molluscs, small mammals, and reptiles, and such seeds,\r\nfruits, nuts, etc., as wild plants supply. The art of kindling fire is\r\nprobably known to all existing savages, but much of their food is eaten\r\nuncooked.\r\n\r\nIn the state of barbarism tribal organization may exist; some form of\r\nreligion is usually recognised; definite marriage relations are entered\r\ninto, although polygamy is commonly practised; permanent houses, perhaps\r\nfor winter use only, are built; clothes are made from woven cloth as\r\nwell as from skins; the plaiting of baskets and the art of making coarse\r\npottery, frequently highly decorated, are understood; essentially all\r\nutensils, arms, etc., are of stone, wood, bone, or ivory, the metals\r\nother than those occurring in a native state being unknown; and writing\r\nis unknown, although pictographs may be employed.\r\n\r\nCivilization implies a well-marked development in ethics, laws, social\r\norganization, institutions, arts, writing, etc.\r\n\r\nUnder this scheme of classification various divisions of the aborigines\r\nof North America at the time of the coming of Columbus occupied each of\r\nthe planes of development designated; but those frequently classed as\r\ncivilized had not arrived at an advanced stage of culture, and\r\ncan perhaps with greater propriety be designated as semicivilized, or,\r\nbetter still, be referred to the highest stage of barbarism.\r\n\r\nSome of the native tribes, as those of southern California and certain\r\nof the peoples of Mexico and Central America, were in a state of\r\nsavagery, and, in fact, have not advanced beyond that state at the\r\npresent day. A large majority of the aborigines, as, for example, the\r\nAlgonquins, Shoshoneans, etc., or, in general, all of the Indians to the\r\nnorthward of Arizona and New Mexico, together with certain of the tribes\r\nto the south of that boundary, had definite tribal organization,\r\npermanent homes at least for winter use, in part practised horticulture,\r\nand for these and other reasons are to be classed as in the barbarous\r\nstage of development. The Aztecs, Mayas, etc., of Mexico and Central\r\nAmerica had well-established governments, built permanent and frequently\r\nlarge and elaborately decorated houses, some of which were of hewn\r\nstone, practised horticulture with the aid of irrigation, had developed\r\na system of picture-writing, and were skilled in working native metals.\r\nThese and other advances towards civilization were great and promising,\r\nbut the use of iron was unknown, and their practice of human sacrifice\r\nand the absence of phonetic writing denies them a place among truly\r\ncivilized peoples.\r\n\r\nAnother scheme for the classification of peoples in terms of the highest\r\ngrade of implements used by them is current under which they are placed\r\nin certain ages on the assumption that man in all regions has passed\r\nthrough an orderly sequence in his development, and that the successive\r\nchanges are expressed by the nature of the material used in the\r\nmanufacture of implements. Under this plan of classification we have an\r\nage of stone, an age of bronze, and an age of iron. The stone age is\r\ncommonly divided into two parts: an earlier or _paleolithic_, during\r\nwhich the highest type of implement used is fashioned of stone by\r\nchipping; and a later, or _neolithic_, when implements of stone are\r\nshaped by grinding and polishing. Following the stone age came one of\r\nbronze, when a mixture of copper and tin was used for implements; and\r\nlater the age of iron, beginning when the art of reducing metals\r\nfrom their ores was discovered. In this scheme a copper age is sometimes\r\nincluded, with doubtful propriety, however, if, as in America, the metal\r\nreferred to is obtained in its native condition.\r\n\r\nUnder the somewhat indefinite scheme of classification just referred to\r\nthe North American aborigines, inclusive of the Aztecs, etc., previous\r\nto the coming of European civilization were in the stone age of\r\ndevelopment, although bronze was in use among the Incas of Peru, and to\r\nsome extent had found its way northward as far as Mexico. Certain of the\r\ntribes still used implements of chipped stone, but in the great majority\r\nof instances implements of polished stone were the highest type known.\r\nNative copper was widely used for axes, knives, ornaments, etc., but\r\niron, except such as occurs in meteors, was unknown.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty met with in selecting any one article or any one material\r\nused by primitive peoples as a basis for their classification is\r\nillustrated by the facts just cited, as it places the lowest savage of\r\nAmerica in the same group as the Aztec and the Maya. Obviously, in the\r\nclassification of peoples as with the lower animals all characteristics\r\nshould be included.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE ESKIMOS\r\n\r\nThe extreme northern part of North America is included in the\r\ncircumpolar lands described in another volume of the series of which the\r\npresent book forms a part, and the Eskimos as a people will therefore\r\nreceive but passing attention at this time.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting facts to the geographer concerning the\r\nEskimos is their peculiar distribution. From choice or necessity they\r\nmake their homes on the bleak, inhospitable northern border of the\r\ncontinent, and do not extend inland except where the coast is indented\r\nor large rivers enter the sea. In all localities their dwellings are\r\nnear the water. They are the most northern people on the earth, and\r\ntheir still greater northward extension is checked only by the absence\r\nof land on which to build their winter homes. Their present inland limit\r\non the continent is no doubt determined in part by long-established\r\ncustom and by the distribution of the animals on which they have become\r\ndependent for food, clothing, fuel, etc., but the chief control\r\nformerly, no doubt, more potent than at present, is to be sought in the\r\naggressiveness of the Indians. In Greenland, the arctic archipelago, and\r\nthroughout the immense extent of coast-lands from Labrador to Alaska\r\nthey have been isolated and withdrawn from contact with other peoples\r\nfor a long period of time, and their slow development unmodified by\r\nextraneous influences. In Newfoundland and Alaska, however, they have\r\nbeen in contact with the Indians, trade relations established, and to a\r\nlimited extent an interchange of ideas as well as some intermarriage has\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nThroughout the vast extent of arctic coast between Newfoundland and\r\nAlaska, as well as in Greenland and on the islands of the arctic\r\narchipelago, the Eskimo was the sole inhabitant before the coming of\r\nEuropeans, and one language current from the Atlantic to the Pacific. No\r\nother primitive people has such an extent in longitude. The reason for\r\nthis peculiarity is that between the sea margin, where the Eskimo makes\r\nhis home, and the southern border of the subarctic forest and adjacent\r\nprairies, where the Indians have their hunting-grounds, there intervenes\r\nthe tundra--a neutral ground attractive neither to the Eskimo nor the\r\nIndian.\r\n\r\nThe one thing which more than all else has enabled the Eskimo to\r\nmaintain an existence and to thrive in the frozen north is his discovery\r\nof a means of obtaining heat and light where wood is scarce--that is,\r\nthe invention of the lamp. This invention, as has been shown by Walter\r\nHugh and others, was favoured by the occurrence in the far north of\r\nanimals like the seal and walrus, which yield oil with a high\r\nheat-giving property.\r\n\r\nIn Alaska the Eskimo stock is broken into several tribes speaking\r\ndiverse dialects. Of these, two main subgroups are distinguished,\r\nnamely, Innuits and Aleuts or Aleutians. The former includes several\r\ntribes living on the margin of the mainland, from near Mount St. Elias\r\nnorthward to the Arctic Ocean, and the latter consists of but two\r\ntribes, now intermingled, which at the time of the discovery of\r\nthe Alaskan region by the Russians inhabited the western portion of the\r\nAlaskan peninsula and the Aleutian Islands. A detailed account of these\r\npeoples should have united with it a study of the so-called Tuski of\r\nnortheastern Siberia, who are of the same stock, and, as seems probable,\r\nare the descendants of Eskimos who migrated from America to Asia.\r\n\r\n_The Innuits._--This name, as is stated by W. H. Dall, is applied to\r\nthemselves by all the tribes of the Eskimo stock, except the Aleuts and\r\nthe eastern Siberian natives. It is in use at the present time from\r\nGreenland to Bering Strait, and thence southward to the vicinity of\r\nMount St. Elias.\r\n\r\nIn Alaska the Innuits are divided into at least fourteen tribes,\r\nspeaking as many different dialects, and distinguished by such names as\r\nUgalakmuts, Kaniagmuts, etc. The termination _mut_, in a substantive\r\nsense, means a village at the place or on the river to the name of which\r\nit is added (Dall). In common with all other Eskimo tribes the Innuits\r\nare a sturdy, well-built people, having lighter-coloured skins than the\r\nIndians, and more nearly approaching the yellow of the Asiatics, but\r\ndistinct from it, and in many instances having a decided reddish tinge\r\nto the cheeks. The prevalent idea that the Eskimo is of decidedly short\r\nstature is not borne out by the various tribes in Alaska, who are not\r\nmuch, if any, below the average height of Europeans. Their rotund bodies\r\nand full, round faces, in which the organ answering to a nose is\r\ndepressed until between the eyes it is scarcely distinguishable, suggest\r\nthat the severity of the climate has led to a development of fat for\r\nprotection against cold in the same manner as among the seals and\r\nwalruses. Such a generalization is perhaps misleading, as great\r\nindividual variations occur as among all peoples, but the typical Innuit\r\nwhose figure remains in one's memory when the bony hags, the cadaverous\r\nindividuals, and the aged are forgotten or but dimly recalled, favours\r\nthe conventional pictures of Santa Claus, with a face resembling the\r\nfull moon, small black eyes with a suggestion of obliquity in their\r\nalignment, and nearly complete absence of a beard on the ruddy cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe food of the Eskimos of Alaska, as is the case with all other\r\ndivisions of that people, is derived mainly from the sea. Their diet is\r\nalmost exclusively fish, the blubber and flesh of the seal, walrus, and\r\nwhales, especially the white whale or beluga, which ascends the larger\r\nstreams. To these sources of supply are added the arctic hare, caribou\r\n(reindeer), and in fact any flesh that can be obtained. Vegetable diet\r\nis almost unknown, except so far as it is supplied by the berries that\r\ngrow in profusion on the tundras. The necessity for salt, so marked in\r\nthe case of most peoples, is absent in the far north.\r\n\r\nThe coast of Alaska, where dwells the Innuit, is treeless. Inland from\r\nthe margin of the sea extends the permanently frozen tundra. Wood for\r\nfires, sleds, frames for skin boats, spears, bows, arrows, etc., and in\r\nprehistoric time for producing fire by friction, is derived entirely\r\nfrom driftwood cast on the beach by the waves. This wood, consisting in\r\nmany instances of great tree trunks from which planks two or more feet\r\nwide can be hewn, is brought to the sea by rivers heading far inland,\r\nas, for example, the Yukon and the Kuskokwim, and distributed by the\r\nwind and currents all about the coast and islands of Bering Sea.\r\nDriftwood is also carried to the Arctic Ocean by the Mackenzie, but in\r\ngeneral is not plentiful on the borders of the ice-bound northern ocean.\r\n\r\nThe houses of the Alaskan Innuit previous to the coming of the Russians,\r\nand still to a great extent, consist of a single room, usually measuring\r\nabout 10 by 14 feet, situated in part below the surface of the ground\r\nand entered by means of a tunnel-like passageway. They are made of\r\ndriftwood, and floored, lined, and roofed with planks hewn from the same\r\nmaterial. On a roof of poles sods and earth are placed and rendered\r\ncompact by stamping, thus forming a cover which serves to exclude water\r\nproduced by the melting of the naturally added layer of snow. When\r\nspring-time approaches these partially subterranean winter dwellings are\r\nliable to be inundated, and are abandoned and tents used during summer\r\nseasons. Formerly these tents were made of skins of caribou or seal, but\r\nin these degenerate days cotton drilling bought of white traders\r\nhas been substituted. During winter journeys temporary snow huts are\r\nbuilt, of the oval, bake-oven shape, well known to most Europeans from\r\nthe many pictures that have been published of similar structures made by\r\nthe more northern Eskimos. On the coast of Alaska, however, when\r\ndriftwood is available, the roofs of the snow houses are frequently made\r\nof poles on which snow is piled.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the ordinary winter dwellings, which are usually occupied\r\nby two or more families, each village is commonly supplied with an\r\nassembly house or _casine_ (a word of Russian origin), which serves also\r\nas a bath-house, and in them winter dances, the chief amusement of the\r\npeople, are held. The casine, built by the united efforts of the various\r\nmembers of a community, consist of a single room, in part underground\r\nand entered by a tunnel, which frequently measures some 25 by 30 feet on\r\nthe sides, and is approximately 15 feet high. They are substantially\r\nmade of logs or of thick planks hewn with much labour from stranded tree\r\ntrunks. The roof is of logs covered with moss and earth, and has an\r\nopening in the centre for the escape of smoke from the fire kindled on a\r\nhearth in the centre of the floor. When the fire is not burning, the\r\nopening in the roof is closed with a membrane obtained from the\r\nintestines of the seal. About the sides of the room there is a raised\r\nplatform for spectators during dances and for the use of bathers when\r\nthe customary steam-baths are indulged in. An interesting fact in\r\nconnection with both the ordinary winter homes and the casines, which\r\nindicates their American origin, is that they are communal. A tenement\r\nused by several families in common is characteristic of the American\r\naborigines from the arctic to Panama.\r\n\r\nThe architecture of the Innuits has been modified but little during\r\nrecent years, except that in localities most visited by white men and\r\nwhere trading stations have been established, as at St. Michael,\r\nlog-houses built after the manner of those used by the Russian residents\r\nhave to a considerable extent replaced the native huts, with favourable\r\nresults so far as sanitary conditions are concerned. The Russian\r\nlog-house is not unlike the many similar structures still to be\r\nseen in portions of Canada and the United States, except that the upper\r\nside of each log is hewn so as to have a sharp edge, which fits into a\r\ndeep groove, cut in the log which rests on it. Moss is placed between\r\nthe logs, and is also used to fill all holes and crevices. Air is\r\nusually admitted through a pipe situated beneath the floor and opening\r\nin front of the stove, if one is used, and a small pipe for ventilation\r\npasses out through the roof. In the Russian houses the stove is usually\r\na huge affair, made of large flat stones, which retain heat for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.--Linguistic stocks of indians north of Mexico.]\r\n\r\nThe dress of the Innuits in former days, in common with all the Eskimo\r\ntribes, consisted of skins, and in special cases of the intestines of\r\nseals. The characteristic garment is the parkie or overshirt, not open\r\nin front, however, provided with a hood and made of caribou skin tanned\r\nwith the hair on. Those worn by men have a different cut than those\r\nintended for women. In recent years, and perhaps before the coming of\r\nwhite men, the skins for the manufacture of parkies were derived largely\r\nby trade from the people owning domesticated reindeer in Asia. The\r\nmargin of the hood is commonly made of wolf skins, the long hair of\r\nwhich, blowing across the face, affords much protection. Trousers and\r\nboots made of the skin of the hair-seal or moccasins shaped from the\r\nskin of the leg of a caribou completed the dress. Mats of grass are worn\r\nin the boots or moccasins during cold weather. At the present time the\r\nsummer clothing of the natives throughout Alaska is generally of cloth\r\nobtained from white traders, but nothing brought from more civilized\r\ncountries can replace the parkies, fur trousers, skin boots, and\r\nwaterproof shirts or _kamlaykas_. These articles, except the last\r\nmentioned, are largely used by white men, especially if making winter\r\njourneys.\r\n\r\nThe boats in use among the Innuits are still the _kayak_ and the\r\n_oomiak_, for which civilized man can offer no adequate substitute. The\r\nwell-known kayak, made of a light framework of wood, tied with thongs,\r\nover which is tightly stretched a dressed sealskin covering, leaving\r\nonly one or two circular openings for the occupant, is in use from\r\nGreenland all about the arctic coast of America to Asia. Different\r\nshapes pertain to different tribes. In recent years, as a result\r\nof outside influence, openings for three occupants are sometimes made,\r\nthe size of the boat also being increased. To one familiar with boat and\r\ncanoe travel these light skin craft, with their water-tight decks, seem\r\nthe perfection of boat construction. The occupant lashes the skirt of\r\nhis kamlayka about the raised rim of the opening in which he sits and\r\nthe boat is thus rendered impervious to water from whatever direction.\r\nThe greatest danger is that the parchment-like covering may be ruptured,\r\nas by the cutting edge of thin ice. To ordinary storms, however, they\r\nare more safe than even the deservedly celebrated \"whale-boat\" of the\r\nwhite man. The oomiak, or woman's boat, also made of dressed skin\r\nstretched over a frame, is much larger than the kayak, has a flat\r\nbottom, is without deck covering, and designed for the use of many\r\noccupants. As is well known, boats of each of these types are propelled\r\nby means of paddles. Both the kayak and oomiak are still in every-day\r\nuse, and it is to be hoped the boats of the white man will never wholly\r\nreplace them.\r\n\r\nThe changes in house-building and dress referred to, which have come\r\nfrom contact with white men, are outward signs of a great modification\r\nin the lives of the Innuits, which began in the early days of Russian\r\noccupation and has continued with increasing importance to the present\r\ntime. The natives are quick to imitate the customs of the strangers who\r\nhave visited them, and but for the restraint that the climatic\r\nconditions have put upon them and the high price in furs demanded by\r\ntraders for imported goods the changes thus produced would be far more\r\nmarked than is now the case. To some extent the food of the natives has\r\nbeen modified, flour being in demand, but, with minor exceptions, the\r\nprincipal articles consumed are still such as are obtained by hunting\r\nand fishing.\r\n\r\nThe greatest change that has taken place in the condition of the Alaskan\r\nInnuits, and one which, perhaps, culminated at the time of the recent\r\n\"gold excitement\" on the Yukon and at Cape Nome, is in relation to the\r\nintroduction of intoxicating liquors and of certain contagious diseases.\r\nThese scourges, coming from the south, have been almost as great\r\na blight among the native peoples as would be the sweeping southward of\r\na wave of arctic temperature to the vegetation of tropical lands. The\r\n_curse of contact_, resulting when a civilized race invades a land\r\ninhabited by childlike aborigines, as has been seen in many parts of the\r\nworld, has overtaken the Innuits in common with nearly all other tribes\r\nin Alaska, and decadence and the prolongation of a miserable existence,\r\nunless cut short by extermination through starvation, is all that\r\nseemingly can be hoped for.\r\n\r\nThe fur-bearing animals of Alaska have been greatly reduced in numbers\r\nduring the last twenty-five years: the caribou and the moose have, to a\r\nmarked degree, been killed or driven to remote regions; the larger\r\nwhales, on account of overcapture by American whalers, have become\r\nscarce; the sea-lion and the walrus are nearly extinct; the fur-seal, of\r\nmore importance to the Aleutians than the Innuits, is rapidly\r\napproaching extinction. Thus in many ways the food supply is greatly\r\ndecreased. Recourse to agriculture is impossible. The one redeeming\r\nfeature of the white man's aggression is the introduction of the\r\ndomesticated reindeer from Asia and Lapland. With reindeer, the salmon,\r\nnot as yet depleted in the streams emptying into Bering Sea, the white\r\nwhale, the hair-seal, not as yet of commercial value, the countless\r\nbirds of summer, the berries of the tundra, etc., the Innuits can\r\nsurvive, maintain their manhood, and become useful to civilization in\r\ncertain ways if the curse of drink and the spread of imported diseases\r\ncould be stopped. Such a change, however, for various reasons, is not to\r\nbe hoped for. It may perhaps be said that the influence of missionaries,\r\nand, what is vastly more important, the work of the school-teacher, has\r\nopened to these children of the cold northern land a way to\r\ncivilization, but the results up to the present time are not reassuring.\r\n\r\nThe census of 1890 showed that the Innuits of Alaska numbered 13,045. In\r\nthe census of 1900 a separate enumeration of Eskimos and Indians was not\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe dismal picture I have been compelled to sketch of the present\r\ncondition and future prospects of the Innuits of Alaska, in order\r\nto indicate their status at the opening of the twentieth century,\r\napplies also with variations in detail and some hopeful signs to a large\r\nmajority of the other aboriginal tribes of North America.\r\n\r\n_The Aleutians._--The aboriginal inhabitants of the Aleutian Islands are\r\ntermed Aleuts or Aleutians, a word of obscure and perhaps foreign\r\nderivation. As stated above, they belong to the Eskimo family, but are\r\nmore widely separated from the parent stock than any other of its\r\nconstituent tribes. Evidence advanced by W. H. Dall tends to show that\r\nthey are of American continental origin. At the time of the first coming\r\nof the Russians, about 1750, they were at war with the Kaniagmuts, who\r\ninhabited the greater part of the Alaskan peninsula and were the nearest\r\ntribe of the Innuits.\r\n\r\nWhen discovered by the Russians the Aleuts were an active, sprightly\r\npeople, fond of the dance and of festivities. They are of lighter\r\ncolour, but not perhaps in general more nearly white than the\r\nfull-blooded Innuits. At present it is difficult to find even a single\r\nrepresentative of unmixed descent, Russian occupation having stamped out\r\nor greatly modified nearly every native characteristic both of body and\r\nmind. They were originally a robust people, of about the average height\r\nfound in civilized countries, with coarse black hair and scanty beards.\r\nTheir island life, where no large game invited inland journeys, made\r\nthem emphatically \"canoe people.\" The habit of sitting in their kayaks\r\nand using the muscles of the upper portion of the body in paddling,\r\nthrowing the spear, etc., while the lower portion of the body received\r\nbut little exercise, led to a fine chest development and to undersized\r\nand comparatively weak legs. The women, to whom the use of the kayak was\r\nnot intrusted, were better proportioned than the men, and many of them\r\nare pleasing in appearance. As stated by Dall, they were less determined\r\nthan their neighbours on the mainland, the Kaniagmuts, but were by no\r\nmeans devoid of courage. Their mode of worship partook more of the\r\ncharacter of a religion than that of any other of the Eskimo tribes in\r\ntheir native condition.\r\n\r\nFrom what can be learned of the Aleuts in their uncontaminated native\r\nstate, they seem to have been the most intelligent of all the Eskimo\r\ntribes and the one which gave the greatest promise, if treated humanely,\r\nof advancement when civilization was introduced. Less than a century of\r\ncontact with Russian invaders, however, led to a depth of degradation\r\nthat is only paralleled and possibly not exceeded by the shameful\r\nresults of the Spanish invasion among the aborigines of the West Indies.\r\nOne of the darkest chapters in American history, fortunately for the\r\ncredit of Europeans now largely lost, is that containing an account of\r\nthe brutal treatment the Aleuts received at the hands of the Russians.\r\nThe childlike natives became worse than slaves. The debauchery of their\r\noppressors was shameful. As stated by Dall, \"the Aleuts were subjected\r\nto the most horrible outrages. The names of Glottoff and Solovioff (two\r\nRussian explorers, 1764-'65) make them shudder to this day. Thousands\r\nperished under sword and fire. Long after those enormities were checked\r\nthe Russians considered the Aleuts as beasts rather than men,\" etc.\r\nTheir numbers, estimated at 10,000 in 1799, were, according to a Russian\r\ncensus, reduced to 5,238 in 1808, and, as stated by Dall, numbered not\r\nmore than 1,500 in 1870. The census of 1890 gives it as 967.\r\n\r\nThe incentive to Russian oppression was the greed for furs and the lust\r\nof rude men at a distance from all centres of control. The Aleutian\r\nIslands and neighbouring waters is the home of the sea-otter, which is\r\nclothed with the most beautiful of all furs. Near at hand are the\r\nPribilof Islands, to which the fur-seal formerly resorted each summer in\r\ncountless numbers, and during its migrations traversed the passes\r\nseparating the islands of the Aleutian chain, where they were easily\r\ntaken; the commercial value of their skins previous to about 1867,\r\nhowever, was small. In addition, the land-otter and several species of\r\nfoxes also inhabited the same region. These allurements tempted the\r\nRussians, and besides the Aleutian Islands, with their sheltered\r\nharbours, furnished favourable stations from which to extend the fur\r\ntrade into the still greater region to the eastward, and at an\r\nearly date in the foreign occupation of Alaska became a basis for\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nThe entire fur trade in Russian America was placed by charter in the\r\nhands of the Russian-American Fur Company in 1799, which, like the\r\nHudson's Bay Company, had territorial jurisdiction as well as trade\r\nmonopoly. This powerful company maintained its existence under various\r\nrenewals of its charter until the purchase of Alaska by the United\r\nStates in 1867. The authority conferred on the Russian company gave it\r\nexclusive right to purchase furs from the natives, and thus to dictate\r\nprices. This system was fraught with evil to the natives, and their\r\nextinction would no doubt have resulted had it not been for the\r\ninfluence of missionaries of the Russian-Greek Church, among whom the\r\nname of Veniaminoff will ever be held in blessed memory. In a measure\r\nthe gross oppression of the Russians brought its own punishment to the\r\noffenders. The decrease in the number of the Aleutians meant a decline\r\nin the number of pelts secured. To insure the gathering of the highly\r\nprized furs the native hunters must be maintained. The later days of\r\nRussian occupation were characterized by more humane treatment of the\r\nnatives, schools were established among them, liquors withheld, and\r\ntheir rapid decline checked. When Alaska was purchased by the United\r\nStates the Russian-American Fur Company was supplanted by the Alaskan\r\nCommercial Company, to whom a lease of the Pribilof Islands was granted.\r\nIn this lease provision was made for the support and education of the\r\nAleutians on the Pribilof Islands. As the chief and almost the sole\r\nemployment open to the Aleutians during the past thirty years has been\r\nthe taking of sealskins on these islands, this wise provision had a\r\nbeneficent influence on the entire tribe. How faithfully the Alaskan\r\nCommercial Company carried out its contract has been seriously\r\nquestioned, but it is, nevertheless, a fact that the Aleutians have\r\nfared better under American than under Russian rule. A gradual adverse\r\nchange in their condition has come about, however, owing to the decrease\r\nand threatened extinction of the sea-otter, and the great decline in the\r\nnumber of the fur-seals owing to the attacks made on them during\r\ntheir annual migrations, which amounts to commercial extinction. The\r\nlucrative industries of the natives have thus practically disappeared,\r\nand there is nothing to take their place. The surviving members are\r\nobjects of charity, but as yet the United States Government has made no\r\nadequate provision for their support. One method of ameliorating the\r\nexisting adverse conditions that is practicable is the introduction of\r\ndomesticated reindeer; another, not so easy to accomplish, is the\r\nsuppression of the liquor traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE INDIANS\r\n\r\nThe aborigines of the New World to the southward of the narrow strip of\r\narctic coast-land inhabited by the Eskimo are designated by the term\r\nIndian, as already explained. There is no sharp line of demarcation\r\nbetween the Indians of North and South America, one shading into the\r\nother, but only those of the northern continent are here considered.\r\n\r\nIn many scientific treatises, as well as in books of travel and general\r\nliterature, the Indians are frequently referred to as \"red men,\" and the\r\nterm \"copper coloured\" commonly applied to them. To the writer each of\r\nthese expressions seems infelicitous. It is true that throughout America\r\nthe Indians have a reddish undertone in their colour, but in numerous\r\ntribes it is not pronounced. As to copper colour, the meaning of the\r\nterm is vague. What is copper colour? Presumably the colour of the pure\r\nmetal when unoxidized. No such colour is more than suggested even by the\r\naborigines having the lightest skins in the members of the many tribes\r\nthat have come under the writer's notice. A more correct term--but this\r\nis a matter of opinion, in which differences are permissible--would be\r\nbrown, of which many shades occur, ranging from light cinnamon colour to\r\ndark chocolate, and even nearly black. There is no recognisable\r\nconnection between variations in colour and climatic conditions. The\r\nfaces, hands, and other freely exposed portions of their bodies are\r\ndarker than the parts usually covered with clothing, and frequently\r\nsuggest the appearance of bronze statutes not fully darkened by\r\nexposure to the weather. In colour they more nearly approach that of the\r\nPolynesians than any other peoples, but in general are of a darker hue.\r\nThe members of the various Indian tribes, although presenting a wide\r\nrange of differences, have many physiological and mental resemblances,\r\nwhich, like their languages, serve to set them apart from all other\r\npeoples. A composite picture of their persons would show a man sinewy\r\nrather than heavy in build, but there are many exceptions; of average\r\nstature, 5 feet 8 or 10 inches, but there are tribes whose average is\r\nmore, and others in which it is less; dark brown, with a reddish\r\nundertone, in colour; deep-set, black, and in general small eyes, their\r\nalignment straight; the nose prominent and frequently well shaped; mouth\r\nlarge, with strong, frequently perfect teeth; lower jaw massive; and\r\nface beardless or nearly so, and the hair of the scalp long, coarse, and\r\nblack. In order to make such a sketch realistic, the bronze-like\r\nathletic figure must be clothed in a blanket worn with the grace of a\r\nRoman toga or wrapped in a robe of bison-skin; the feet encased in\r\nmoccasins of tanned deerskin, and usually decorated with beads or\r\nvariously coloured porcupine-quills; the face striped, dotted, or\r\nblotched with various colours; the coarse hair falling like a thatch to\r\nthe shoulder, or braided, and in certain tribes shaved or plucked,\r\nexcept only the traditional scalp-lock, and decorated with feathers,\r\nmost frequently of the eagle; necklaces, rings in the ears, amulets,\r\netc., made of the claws of the bear, shells, beads, quills, etc.,\r\nbespeak various tribes; the primitive weapons were the hatchet-like\r\ntomahawk, the bow and arrow, and the spear. The Indian has been\r\nidealized in the writings of poets and novelists, but occasionally, even\r\nat the present day, one meets with an approach to the ideal. Judged by\r\nthe standards of civilization, as he is seen to-day on numerous\r\nreservations and about the streets of towns, he is a lazy, dirty\r\nvagabond. A far more favourable and agreeable picture is presented,\r\nespecially in the eastern portion of Canada and adjacent States to the\r\nsouth and in the Indian Territory, where the blessings of civilization\r\nhave been accepted and the once roaming savage has become a tiller of\r\nthe soil, an owner of cattle and sheep, and lives in a comfortable\r\nhouse supplied with furniture such as white men use.\r\n\r\nWhile a racial likeness impossible to conceal unites all of the various\r\ntribes, no single picture or generalized description, however carefully\r\nprepared, can convey to one unfamiliar with the Indian an accurate idea\r\nof his personal appearance. A typical example from one tribe when\r\ncritically studied is found to differ widely from an equally\r\nrepresentative example of another tribe, not only in speech, dress,\r\nmethods of wearing the hair, ornaments, etc., but also in physique and\r\nin mental traits.\r\n\r\nIn temperament the Indian is usually described as being moody, reserved,\r\nwary, grave, and his face expressionless, the current of his thoughts\r\nbeing unrevealed in his proud, indifferent bearing. In his own mind he\r\nseems to consider himself superior to all other beings, and to regard\r\nthem with contemptuous indifference. All this is true enough as seen by\r\na stranger, but in his home life, and not infrequently when in the\r\npresence of trusted white men, the mask of indifference is laid aside\r\nand the laugh and jest indulged in. The extreme of assumed indifference\r\nis exhibited, as has been well attested by many witnesses, when death by\r\ntorture is inflicted on a captive, as, for example, burning alive, when\r\nno outward sign is permitted to reveal his intense suffering.\r\n\r\nThe Indian is a hunter and fisherman both from inheritance and\r\nnecessity. From his mode of life his sense of sight and of hearing have\r\nbecome wonderfully acute. His skill in following a trail is proverbial.\r\nWhen living near the sea or by the side of streams and lakes he is as\r\nmuch at home in a canoe as his relative of the plains in post-Columbian\r\ndays when seated on his hardy pony. In current literature, however, all\r\nof these traits, as in the case of the personality of the Indian, have\r\nbeen fused into one ideal. It is true that the Indian hunter is more\r\nskilled in following a trail, in interpreting the signs and sounds in\r\nthe forest, in shooting the foaming rapids in his frail canoe, etc.,\r\nthan the average white man to whom such pursuits are incidental or newly\r\nacquired; but many white men, and particularly those who have in a\r\nmeasure degenerated and assumed the Indian mode of life, are his\r\nequal, if not his superior, in all that pertains to woodcraft.\r\n\r\nIn mental qualities the Indian is the inferior of the Caucasian and the\r\nAsiatic, but is the superior of the negro. The ability to advance is not\r\nabsent, and capacity to reach a certain grade in civilization is\r\ngeneral, but beyond the acquirement of indifferent skill in the arts,\r\nliterature, etc., but few have passed. The mental quality of\r\nperseverance under adverse conditions and of continuous application has\r\nnot been granted him.\r\n\r\nThese children of the forests and plains, easily pleased and as easily\r\nangered; kind to their children and friends, but cruelly revengeful when\r\nenraged; treasuring a kindness, but never forgetting an injury; without\r\nrigid self-control, as is sadly illustrated by their inordinate passion\r\nfor liquor when once a taste for it is acquired, are plastic organisms,\r\nwhich reflect the conditions under which they have developed. These\r\nuntutored barbarians, descendants from ancestors who brought little with\r\nthem save the stone axe and the stone spear, but of necessity originated\r\nall their arts and institutions without contact with other peoples, and\r\nwere exposed to a wide range of climatic and other physical conditions\r\nfor many centuries, present a most instructive subject for the study of\r\nthe geographer and others who are interested in the relation of man to\r\nhis environment.\r\n\r\n_Resources._--To the Indian in pre-Columbian days no ships from overseas\r\nbrought supplies, and as the various tribes were frequently at war with\r\ntheir neighbours, trade relations were greatly restricted. Intertribal\r\nbarter was carried on, however, and the capture of supplies and utensils\r\nof various sorts by one tribe from another favoured their dispersion.\r\nAlthough such articles as the native copper of the Lake Superior region,\r\nthe red pipe-stone (catlinite) of Minnesota, and obsidian from various\r\nplaces found its way to remote localities, each tribe had essentially to\r\nsupply its wants from the natural resources of its own domain. The range\r\nin raw materials, to borrow a modern commercial term, that the Indian's\r\nintellectual development permitted him to utilize is indicated in the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n                    { Animal: Mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes,\r\n                    {    crustaceans, insects, and at times human flesh.\r\n                    {\r\n                    {           { Wild--roots, bulbs, seeds, fruits, nuts,\r\n                    {           {   bark, berries, sap.\r\n Used for food.     { Vegetable { Cultivated--maize, cacao, melons,\r\n                    {           {   squashes, tomatoes, sweet potatoes,\r\n                    {           {   potatoes, pineapple, (tobacco).\r\n                    {\r\n                    { Mineral: Salt, (earth in certain instances).\r\n\r\n                    { Animal: Skins, sinews, tendons, hair, wool,\r\n                    {    feathers, and cochineal for dyes.\r\n                    {\r\n Used for clothing. { Vegetable { Wild--bark, fibres, roots, dyes, gums.\r\n                    {           { Cultivated--cotton, aloe (?)\r\n                    {\r\n                    { Mineral: Dyes, such as ochres and cinnabar,\r\n                    {   charcoal.\r\n\r\n                    { Animal: Skins, sinew, etc.\r\n Used in the        {\r\n   construction of  { Vegetable: Logs, bark, seeds; grass, roots, etc.,\r\n   houses.          {   for mats.\r\n                    {\r\n                    { Mineral: Stone, adobe, sods, earth, selenite\r\n                    {   (caves).\r\n\r\n                    { Animal: Skins, sinew; oil in paint; quills, shells,\r\n                    {   etc., for decoration.\r\n Used in making     {\r\n   boats.           { Vegetable: Tree trunks, bark, seeds, pitch.\r\n                    {\r\n                    { Mineral: Asphaltum; metallic oxides, etc., for\r\n                    {   paint.\r\n\r\n                    { Animal: Bones, horns, skins, scales, teeth, shells.\r\n                    {\r\n                    { Vegetable: Wood, bark, nuts, leaves, fibre, dyes,\r\n                    {   pitch.\r\n Used in making     {\r\n   utensils and     { Mineral: Soapstone for pots, pipes, etc.; obsidian,\r\n   weapons.         {   flint, etc., for spear and arrow points, knives,\r\n                    {   scrapers, etc.; various hard stones and pebbles\r\n                    {   for axes, mortars, pestles, etc.; copper for axes,\r\n                    {   knives, etc.; mineral dyes; gold and silver.\r\n\r\n                    { Animal: Skins, hair, fur, bones, hoofs, claws,\r\n                    {   teeth, ivory, oil in paints; shells, coral,\r\n                    {    pearls, feathers, quills, scales, etc.\r\n Used as personal   {\r\n   ornaments and in { Vegetable: Seeds; fibres for mats, basket-work, etc.\r\n   the decoration   {\r\n   of houses,       { Mineral: Stone (turquoise, emerald, jasper, mica,\r\n   boats, etc.      {   catlinite, etc.), clay, gold, silver, meteoric\r\n                    {   iron; and various metallic oxides, cinnabar, etc.,\r\n                    {   for paints.\r\n\r\nIn these several ways, and yet others, as in their games, medical\r\npractice, elaborate religious ceremonials, mortuary customs, modes of\r\ntravel, etc., the aborigines utilized a wide range of materials supplied\r\nby nature, and supplemented them by horticulture, and to an exceedingly\r\nlimited extent by domesticating animals. The degree to which they\r\nutilized the natural supplies was much less in certain directions than\r\nbecame possible to civilized people, but several sources of raw\r\nmaterials prized by them have not been called upon by white men, and are\r\nnow in greater or less measure abandoned by the natives\r\nthemselves. The vast mineral wealth of the continent was almost entirely\r\nunavailing to the aborigines, except so far as native metals were\r\ndiscovered; while several articles, such as the camass, the seeds of\r\ngrasses, insects, etc., for food and material, used for implements, as\r\nobsidian for arrow points, spears, and knives, catlinite and other\r\nstones for pipes, porcupine-quills for decoration, etc., are of small\r\nvalue to Europeans. While civilized man has become more and more\r\nindependent of climatic and other natural conditions, largely through\r\nthe aid of commerce, the aborigines were much less resistant and were\r\nforced to adjust themselves to their environment, and like other plastic\r\norganisms, were modified by it.\r\n\r\n_The Natural Food Supply._--The food of the Indians was mainly the flesh\r\nof mammals, birds, and fishes. The smaller deer of various species\r\ninhabited the entire continent from the subarctic forest to Panama. The\r\nrange of the bears was equally extensive, but in certain instances, on\r\naccount of superstitious fear, were not customarily used for food. The\r\nalmost universal source of food supply furnished by the smaller deer was\r\nsupplemented at the far north by the Barren Ground caribou, succeeded\r\nsouthward by the woodland caribou; overlapping the range of the latter\r\nand extending farther south was the moose; this, in turn, was\r\nsupplemented and exceeded in southern range by the Wapiti (elk); more\r\nrestricted was the range of the mountain-sheep and mountain-goat, each\r\ninhabiting the Pacific mountains; on the Great plains roamed the bison\r\nand the antelope, the former extending from the central Atlantic\r\nseaboard to the Snake River plains, and the latter from the subarctic\r\nforest to Mexico. The mammalian food supply was most abundant in the\r\ntemperate belt, and while decreasing northward, declined more rapidly\r\ntowards the south. The food supply furnished by fishes was plentiful\r\nwherever water was present, and in superabundance in tidal rivers and\r\nestuaries both on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts; but these resources\r\nfluctuated in a conspicuous way with seasonal changes, owing especially\r\nto the annual migrations of the shad and salmon. Supplementing the\r\nhighly desirable fish-food on the ocean shores were the molluscs,\r\nand especially the oyster and the clam. The rivers, particularly of the\r\nMississippi Basin, supplied fresh-water \"clams\" (_Unios_), and the\r\nsaline and alkaline lakes of the arid region, inclusive of Mexico,\r\nteemed with the larvae of insects, which were utilized for food. In the\r\nAtlantic and Mississippi region, south of the Great Lakes and extending\r\nto Central America, lived the wild turkey; the forests of the Atlantic\r\nand Pacific coasts, the vast prairies, and the no less extensive\r\nsage-brush plains to the westward were inhabited by various species of\r\ngrouse; the land east of the Pacific mountains, from the Gulf of Mexico\r\nfar northward, was darkened by immense flights of pigeons; the water\r\nfrom the far south to the far north, throughout the breadth of the\r\ncontinent, were visited by large numbers of swans, geese, ducks, and\r\nother water birds. In a conspicuous way the feathered hosts, valuable\r\nfor food, were migratory, thus again introducing a variable quantity\r\ninto the lives of the aborigines.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable food of the Indian tribes that did not practise\r\nhorticulture varied from locality to locality, and in the temperate and\r\nmore northern regions fluctuated through a wide range with seasonal\r\nchanges. Berries were abundant in certain regions and at certain\r\nseasons. The raspberry, blackberry, huckleberry, strawberry, etc., of\r\nmany varieties, grew wild in the eastern Mississippi and Atlantic coast\r\nregions. The huckleberry extended from the northern Atlantic coast\r\nregions westward across the continent on the southern border of the\r\nsubarctic forest, and reached central Alaska. On the coast of British\r\nColumbia and Alaska to Mount St. Elias, salmon-berries, wild currants,\r\nhuckleberries, and strawberries flourished with marvellous luxuriance\r\nand of large size. Wild cherries were abundant on the Atlantic coast and\r\nextended to the Pacific mountains. Certain small plums of value for food\r\noccurred widely in what is now the United States. The papaw and\r\npersimmon thrived in the southern portion of the Atlantic coast region.\r\nThe fruits of the cacti yielded refreshment in the southwestern States\r\nand in Mexico. Throughout all the hardwood forests of the Mississippi\r\nValley and the region south of the St. Lawrence a large variety\r\nof nut-bearing trees, such as the walnut, hickory, chestnut, beechnut,\r\noak, etc., were in great abundance and furnished a large annual food\r\nsupply. In the northern portion of this region grew the maple, the\r\nsaccharine sap of which was utilized by the Indians for making sugar. In\r\nthe Pacific mountains south of Canada grew the pinyon, perhaps of all the\r\ntrees of the continent the species that yielded the greatest food supply\r\nto the Indians. In this same region, particularly to the northward, grew\r\nthe small lily-like plant having a blue flower, known as the camass, the\r\nbulbs of which are highly nutritious. Both the pinyon and the camass are\r\nlargely utilized even at the present day for food by the Indians. In\r\nMexico, Central America, and the West Indies a large number of tropical\r\nfruits, bulbs, nuts, etc., abound, which are suitable for food, and, as\r\nwe have more or less direct evidence, were utilized by the Indians of\r\nthat region in prehistoric times. The period of harvest at the south is\r\nless sharply defined than in temperate latitudes and the natural food\r\nsupply subject to less seasonal fluctuations.\r\n\r\nThe Indians so long as they did not engage in agriculture--there being\r\nan absence of anything that could be termed commerce, and even the\r\ntransfer of food and other supplies by barter being restricted--were\r\nobliged to move from place to place, in order to avail themselves of the\r\nabundance furnished in certain localities and at certain seasons. This\r\nis well illustrated at the present day. With the coming of the salmon in\r\nthe rivers of the northwest Pacific coast region the Indian feasts by\r\nthe river-side; when the berries ripen in the valleys of the Cascade\r\nMountains he is there, together with the bears, to profit by the\r\nbounties of nature; in Nevada he still makes journeys to the pinyon\r\ngroves in October; and in the subarctic forest he accompanies the\r\nmigration of the caribou. In former days he followed the movements of\r\nthe herds of bison on the Great plateaus. In these and many other ways\r\nthe food supply of the Indian tended to establish nomadic customs, and\r\nas each source of fuel and other supplies demanded different methods of\r\ncapturing animals or different utensils for gathering seeds,\r\netc., variations in culture development was a necessary result. The duty\r\nof replenishing the general stores was shared by all, but there was no\r\ndefinite organization for this purpose, and certainly nothing worth the\r\nname of business management. As the adage is, \"What is every one's\r\nbusiness is no one's business,\" and for this reason the Indian, as a\r\nrule, failed to lay aside a sufficient supply of food for winter use,\r\nand in consequence frequently went hungry and not infrequently died of\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of the spontaneous food supply at certain seasons or during\r\nexceptional years, and the recurrence of cold or rainy seasons,\r\nnecessitating shelter, would naturally lead the Indian to develop in two\r\nimportant directions, namely, agriculture and architecture. As is well\r\nknown, promising advances had been made in each of these arts, when\r\nindigenous development was checked and to a great extent killed by the\r\nappearance on the scene and subsequent encroachments of peoples from\r\nover the sea.\r\n\r\n_Horticulture._--Concerning the art of cultivating plants for food,\r\nclothing, utensils, etc., practised by the Indians before the coming of\r\nEuropeans, it is difficult to obtain accurate information. The writings\r\nof Spanish and other explorers who first visited various tribes have\r\nbeen diligently searched in this connection by students of American\r\nhistory, and although much that is instructive has been discovered, many\r\nquestions remain unanswered.\r\n\r\nThe principal regions where cultivation of the soil was practised in\r\npre-Columbian times are situated in the United States south of the St.\r\nLawrence and east of the Mississippi Valley, and inclusive of the lands\r\nbordering the Great Lakes on the south; also much of New Mexico,\r\nArizona, Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies. In the eastern\r\nportion of what is now the United States localities naturally devoid of\r\ntrees were cultivated by the Indians, and partial clearings were made in\r\nthe vast forest by deadening the trees, probably by girdling or cutting\r\nthe bark entirely around their trunks with stone axes, and leaving them\r\nstanding. A similar process was employed by white settlers in later\r\nyears, and is practised even at the present day. In these partial\r\nclearings, from which the underbrush was no doubt burned, gardens of\r\nmaize, melons, pumpkins, beans, gourds, sunflowers, potatoes, tobacco,\r\nand perhaps other plants were grown without irrigation. Garden-beds, as\r\nthey are termed, are still to be seen in the forests of Michigan, which,\r\nas indicated by the trees growing on them, are older than the time white\r\nmen began the cultivation of the soil of that region. In the arid\r\nsouthwestern portion of the continent and in Central America gardens\r\nwere cultivated with the aid of irrigation, and what has been described\r\nas a high degree of skill in horticulture attained. The chief products\r\nof these gardens were maize, cotton, tobacco, beans, melons, cacao,\r\nbananas, and the red pepper. Possibly vanilla, tomatoes, and pumpkins\r\nwere also grown. The aloe was extensively utilized in the south, but\r\nwhether definitely cultivated or not seems uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of fruit-trees other than the cacao, which furnishes the\r\nseeds from which chocolate is made, does not seem to have been carried\r\non, although certain writers imply that native trees were tended and\r\ngiven greater facility for growth by removing adjacent plants. It is\r\nstated by some authors that in the region to the eastward of the\r\nMississippi the Chickasaw plum is now found growing in clearings that\r\nwere abandoned by the Indians and not elsewhere, and the inference is\r\nthat it was formerly cultivated. Asa Gray mentions, however, that this\r\nspecies is probably not indigenous.\r\n\r\nOf domesticated mammals none are known to have been possessed by the\r\nIndians except the dog, which it is presumed was derived from one or\r\nmore species of the native wolf, and was used to carry or draw burdens,\r\nserved also for food, and furnished skins for clothing and hair for\r\nweaving cloth. The turkey was domesticated by the Aztecs and the village\r\nIndians of the New Mexico region; among the latter, even at the present\r\nday, eagles are confined in cages and plucked for feathers. There is\r\nseemingly no doubt but that in pre-Columbian, as in recent years, the\r\nyoung of wild animals were captured by the Indians and reared as pets,\r\nwhich in times of necessity probably served for food; but there are no\r\nrecords of definite attempts to domesticate the bison, mountain-sheep,\r\nmountain-goat, or the peccary of the Gulf coast and Central America. In\r\nthe attractive accounts that have appeared in recent years concerning\r\nthe grandeur of the Aztecs mention is made of extensive menageries, but\r\neven the most poetic of historians has not assigned to the tribes of\r\nthat confederation flocks and herds. The llama and the paco or alpaca,\r\nalthough reared extensively by the Incas of Peru, are not certainly\r\nknown to have been introduced into North America.\r\n\r\nTo the eastward of the Mississippi, where numerous earthworks bear\r\ntestimony of an early settlement by aborigines, heavy forests, the\r\nseverity of the winter climate, and wide variations in summer rains\r\ncombined to make the natural conditions to a marked degree adverse to\r\naboriginal development. In Central America, and the West Indies\r\ngenerally, the exuberance of vegetable growth is such as almost to defy\r\nthe clearing of land by people provided only with stone or copper\r\nutensils. Between these two regions, in the southwestern portion of the\r\ncontinent, are the arid lands, where, when once the idea of irrigation\r\nwas embraced, the conditions favouring a sedentary life, with\r\nagriculture as a basis, are far more auspicious than elsewhere. The land\r\nis there treeless, the indigenous plants are easily killed by fire and\r\nby irrigation, the soil is rich, intense sunshine favours plant growth,\r\nand the gathering of harvests is not delayed or the efforts of industry\r\nrendered abortive by rain. Of all portions of the continent, this is the\r\none where resistance to human development is least, providing man's\r\nideas are sufficiently advanced to permit him to grasp and put in\r\npractise the art of irrigation. It is reasonable to suppose that the\r\nIndian there first began to build permanent homes and to cultivate the\r\nsoil. This hypothesis is sustained in part by historical evidence, and\r\nin part by the ruins of ancient villages or communal houses, irrigation,\r\nditches, etc. From this centre it may be presumed, in the absence of\r\ndefinite proof, that the art of horticulture spread to Central America\r\nand the Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the glowing accounts given by certain historians concerning\r\nthe high degree of skill in agriculture attained by the\r\naborigines of Mexico and Central America, and the extent of their\r\nplantations, a conservative balancing of the evidence indicates that\r\nthey never advanced beyond the stage of gardening, and that field\r\nagriculture, the cultivation of orchards, and the domestication of\r\nmammals was practically unknown to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Lodge or Tepee, Blackfoot Indians, Manitoba.\r\nPhotograph by William Notman & Son.]\r\n\r\n_Houses._--The houses of the primitive Indians, owing to the various\r\nstages in culture attained by different tribes and differences in\r\nclimatic conditions, showed a wide range in material used and in the\r\nresults obtained. The shelters of the wandering tribes and of the\r\nvillage Indians during their journeys were usually some form of tent,\r\neither composed wholly of boughs or of a framework of sticks over which\r\nskins were spread and secured by thongs. The typical _wigwam_ consisted\r\nof a number of poles from 15 to 18 feet long, lashed together at the top\r\nand arranged in a circle some 10 feet in diameter at the base, on which\r\na covering of skins, bark, or mats was spread, leaving an opening at the\r\ntop for the escape of smoke from a small fire placed on the ground\r\nwithin. At the top a wing-like extension of the covering was frequently\r\nprovided which could be adjusted to the direction of the wind. An\r\nopening on one side, protected by a curtain of skin, or closed by\r\ndrawing the covering together, served as a door. A modification of this\r\ngenuine Indian lodge, or _tepee_, in which cotton cloth is substituted\r\nfor the primitive covering, may be seen over a wide extent of the\r\ncountry to the west of the Mississippi at the present day (Fig. 36).\r\n\r\nA step higher than the usually circular lodge of boughs, etc., in use\r\nprincipally among the Indians to the west of the Mississippi, was\r\nfurnished by the bark houses of the northeastern tribes, as those of New\r\nYork, in which a rectangular frame of poles with an arched or triangular\r\nroof was covered with bark, usually of the elm, tied to the inner frame\r\nand held also by an external frame of poles, the two frames being lashed\r\nfirmly together. This, the celebrated \"long house\" of the Iroquois, like\r\nmost Indian houses, was designed to accommodate a number of families,\r\nand may be said to have consisted of several houses placed end to end\r\nwith a common passageway running through them. Fires were lighted\r\nin this passageway, one for each family, and the smoke allowed to escape\r\nthrough openings in the roof. One of these bark houses is described by\r\nan early traveller as being 80 feet long, 17 feet wide, and with a\r\ncommon passageway 6 feet wide running through its length, on each side\r\nof which were apartments 5 feet square. Smaller houses, usually for the\r\nuse of a few families, were also built. The larger ones, as was common\r\nin many Indian villages, were occupied both as dwellings and for general\r\nassemblies. These houses were grouped in villages, about which\r\npalisades, consisting of poles planted in the ground, were frequently\r\nbuilt, and in at least one instance a ditch filled with water was used\r\non the outside of the palisade to increase their security against\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nThe feature of special interest concerning the houses of the American\r\naborigines, inclusive of the Eskimos, is that they were usually occupied\r\nby a number of families. This communal idea runs through all the\r\nindigenous American architecture. As remarked by Lewis H. Morgan, one of\r\nthe most judicious students of American ethnology, \"the house for a\r\nsingle family was exceptional throughout aboriginal America, while the\r\nhouse large enough to accommodate several families was the rule.\r\nMoreover, they were occupied as joint tenement-houses. There was also a\r\ntendency to form these households on the principle of gentile kin, the\r\nmothers with their children being of the same gens or clan.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea of the joint tenement-house, as has been clearly shown by\r\nMorgan, illustrated by the bark cabins of the Iroquois, finds its most\r\nstriking expression in the communal houses, or _pueblos_, of the village\r\nIndians of New Mexico and Arizona, and in the abandoned stone houses of\r\nCentral America. In the arid southwestern portion of the continent\r\ncertain tribes, termed the Pueblo Indians, are still living in the\r\nvillages they occupied when first visited by Spanish explorers (1640).\r\nOn account of their exclusiveness and the isolation of their villages in\r\nan immense desert region they have been but slightly modified, so far as\r\ntheir home life is concerned, even at the present day, by contact\r\nwith white men. The hot desert has shielded these people in much the\r\nsame manner that the frozen tundra has served to preserve the purity of\r\nthe Eskimo.\r\n\r\nThe homes of Pueblo Indians, as described by Morgan, are immense\r\ntenement-houses, built of stone and adobe, frequently occupying several\r\nacres of ground, and from 1 to 6 or 7 stories high. The number of\r\ninhabitants at Zuni, one of the most typical of these pueblo towns, is\r\nstated to have been 1,500 in 1851, but to have previously included some\r\n5,000 souls. The adobe, of which the houses are largely constructed, is\r\nthe soil of the region, which when mixed with water and allowed to dry\r\nbecomes sufficiently hard to retain indefinitely in an arid climate the\r\nform given to it. The soil is formed into bricks, and also used as a\r\nmortar to unite rough stones. Although much stone was used in the\r\nconstruction of the pueblos, it was roughly dressed by hammering, or not\r\nchanged at all from its natural condition, and regularly cut and carved\r\nstones do not occur in the buildings. The pueblos were built in\r\nsuccessive terraces, usually either in a semicircle or on three sides of\r\na rectangle, the open side being protected by a wall. Irregular forms\r\nare also known, the general plan being adapted to the natural condition\r\nof the site chosen. In certain instances the structures were placed on\r\nelevations where a high degree of safety was insured, but others are on\r\nthe open plain and even at the base of a commanding eminence, and near\r\nenough to be reached by arrows shot from a bow. Protection against\r\nenemies was increased by an absence of openings in the exterior walls,\r\nexcept at a considerable height above the ground; ingress and\r\ncommunication from terrace to terrace being by means of ladders, which\r\nwere drawn up or their steps removed in times of danger. The roofs of\r\nthe pueblos, as may be seen at Zuni at the present day, are flat and\r\nconsist of poles covered with adobe.\r\n\r\nThe controlling ideas in the construction of the pueblos seems to have\r\nbeen communal residence and defence. The houses are at the same time\r\ntenements and fortresses. A characteristic feature of these, as of\r\npractically all Indian villages, is the presence of one or more\r\nassembly rooms, and of open courts or plazas, where the people gathered\r\nfor council, worship, amusement, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen white men first visited the Pueblo Indians they cultivated gardens\r\nwith the aid of irrigation in which maize, mostly of a blue colour, was\r\nthe principal crop, and had domesticated the turkey; earthen vessels of\r\nlarge size, frequently elaborately and pleasingly decorated, were\r\nmanufactured; cotton fabrics were woven of spun threads, and the men\r\nwere armed with bows and arrows and shields; clothing was made of\r\ndressed deerskins, buffalo-robes, and cotton cloth usually dyed dark\r\nblue. The descriptions of the Pueblo Indians given by the first visitors\r\nfrom civilized peoples would, to a great extent, apply to them at the\r\npresent day, although in reality their lives have been profoundly\r\nmodified and their indigenous development checked.\r\n\r\nThroughout a wide extent of the arid southwest the ruins of ancient\r\npueblos, irrigation canals, remnants of pottery, the latter frequently\r\nmarking village sites on isolated eminences, bear witness of a formerly\r\nwidely spread people. This evidence shows also that the ancestors of the\r\npresent tribes have inhabited the same territory for a great length of\r\ntime. In this same general region are found the houses of the\r\ncliff-dwellers, who excavated rooms in the faces of precipices,\r\nfrequently high above their bases and only accessible by means of holes,\r\nserving as steps, cut in the rock, or with the aid of ladders. In many\r\ninstances these ancient cliff-dwellers, of which no certain descendants\r\nremain, took advantage of natural caverns, or of overhanging ledges,\r\nwhich were closed by means of walls of rough stone and adobe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Panorama of Uxmal, Yucatan.\r\n\r\n     In the foreground at the left is the Pyramid-temple of the\r\n     Magician, _A_, with its small court at the right-hand base.\r\n     Connecting immediately with this is the Nunnery quadrangle,\r\n     _B_, occupying the greater part of the foreground. Behind the\r\n     latter, on the ground level, are two massive ruined walls\r\n     usually referred to as the Gymnasium, _C_, and rising behind\r\n     this is a great triple terrace, on the second level of which,\r\n     at the right, is the House of the Turtles, _D_, and crowning\r\n     the summit is the Governor's Palace, _E_. To the right and\r\n     beyond is the serrated crest of the House of the Pigeons, _F_,\r\n     overshadowed on the left by the massive pyramid, _G_, and\r\n     backed up by a temple-crowned pyramidal pile of inferior\r\n     dimensions, _H_. To the left of the House of the Governor and\r\n     beyond is a group consisting of two pyramids, _I_, and on the\r\n     right of the Nunnery quadrangle, and some distance farther\r\n     away, are other ruined masses, one only coming fully within the\r\n     limits of the picture.--_W. H. Holmes._]\r\n\r\nThe pueblo dwellings, built largely of adobe, are stated by ethnologists\r\nto have extended southward into Mexico, and illustrate the nature of the\r\nhouses in which the Aztecs lived, but the highest type of aboriginal\r\narchitecture in America is furnished by the dwellings and so-called\r\ntemples, palaces, etc., still standing in Yucatan and other portions of\r\nCentral America. In these ruins we have abundant example of buildings\r\nmade of cut stone, laid in regular and even courses, united with\r\nmortar composed of burned lime and sand, and elaborately sculptured in\r\nbas-relief and in the round, or covered with designs moulded in stucco.\r\nIn size and proportions these unique structures are impressive. The\r\nso-called Governor's Palace at Uxmal, Yucatan, is 320 feet long, 40 feet\r\nwide, and 25 to 26 feet high, and surmounts an artificially constructed\r\nplatform of earth 35 feet high and approximately 550 feet square.\r\nThis platform is terraced and provided with broad flights of stone steps\r\n(Fig. 37). These dimensions will serve to render more instructive the\r\naccompanying sketch of the principal ruins at Uxmal by W. H. Holmes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Examples of Maya Arches. After W. H. Holmes.\r\n\r\n    _a._ Section of cuneiform arch with acute apex, Chichen-Itza.\r\n    _b._ Section of ordinary arch with flat capstone.\r\n    _c._ Section of ordinary arch with dressed surfaces.\r\n    _d._ Section of ordinary arch with dressed surfaces and curved\r\n                soffit slopes.\r\n    _e._ Portal arch with long slopes, showing masonry of exterior\r\n                facing.\r\n    _f._ Section of trefoil, portal arch of Palenque.]\r\n\r\nMere size and their great number are not the significant features of\r\nthese ruins. They are well built, of cut stone, and most elaborately\r\ndecorated, as may be seen by the accompanying reproduction of a\r\nphotograph of a typical example. In reference to the skill displayed by\r\nthe unknown architects and builders, Holmes, one of the most recent as\r\nwell as the most critical of Central American travellers, remarks as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"The stone used is the pale-yellowish and reddish-gray, obscurely\r\nmarbled limestone of the locality.... The facings and ornaments are all\r\ncut and sculptured with a masterly handling not surpassed where chisels,\r\npicks, and hammers of iron and steel are used, and the faces and contact\r\nmargins are hewn with perfect precision. Though the finish of the\r\nsurfaces was often secured by means of abrasion or grinding, picking or\r\npecking were the main agents employed, and the indents of the tools are\r\noften apparent and wonderfully fresh-looking. The stones were set in\r\nmortar, although in many cases the joints are so perfect that the mortar\r\ndoes not appear on the surface.\"\r\n\r\nThe extensive ruins of Uxmal, although only a part of the treasures\r\nconcealed in the forests of Central America, express with an eloquence\r\nnot as yet fully appreciated the advanced stage of culture and\r\nrefinement attained in America from the growth of indigenous ideas. Some\r\nof the special features illustrated by them from which the degree of\r\nmental development of their builders can be judged is the presence of\r\nthe wedge-shaped but not of the true arch. The character of the simplest\r\nand perhaps the first style of arch constructed by the awakening peoples\r\nin many lands are shown in the accompanying sketches, borrowed from\r\nHolmes's most instructive report. Columns, both square and round, were\r\nused, and statues both in bas-relief and in the round are common. The\r\ndesigns, whether of animals, grotesque monsters, feathers, or\r\nplants, are in strong relief, either cut in stone or moulded in stucco.\r\nThese designs are not confined to single stones, but embrace several\r\nblocks, and together with the diaper fretwork extend the entire length\r\nof even the larger structures. Accompanying the well-wrought figures of\r\nmen, and at times forming separate inscriptions, are many hieroglyphics,\r\nthe meanings of which are still unknown. All or nearly all of the\r\nstructures stand on artificial platforms, which are terraced. A terraced\r\npyramid, with a broad flight of steps on one or more sides, surmounted\r\nby a well-proportioned rectangular building, faced with cut stone,\r\nhighly decorated, and with a flat roof, are the larger features of the\r\nMaya ruins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Sculptured Facade of Governor's Palace, Uxmal,\r\nYucatan.\r\n\r\n     This very handsome and elaborate piece of work is a section of\r\n     the embellished entablature zone of the palace. The height from\r\n     the lower or medial moulding below to the coping course above\r\n     is about 10 feet. The entire length, covering the four walls of\r\n     the building, is some 725 feet. If we allow that the stones\r\n     employed average 6 by 12 inches in surface dimensions, this\r\n     deeply coffered and relieved mosaic would comprise upward of\r\n     20,000 pieces, all specially cut and a large percentage\r\n     elaborately sculptured. Two plain coping courses are seen at\r\n     the top, followed by a twined fillet moulding, while under this\r\n     is a line of very ornate snouted masks. The broad space below\r\n     is filled with bold fretwork, set on a lattice ground and\r\n     interrupted by the wonderful overdoor trophy, the central\r\n     feature of which is a human figure, fully life size, sculptured\r\n     in the round and seated in a niche with festooned base. The\r\n     head [now displaced] was surrounded by an elaborate and\r\n     colossal head-dress, most of which remains. The horizontal bars\r\n     terminating in serpent heads at both ends are separated by\r\n     lines of hieroglyphs.--_W. H. Holmes._]\r\n\r\nAll of this and more, as can be read in the elaborately illustrated\r\nbooks of Stephens, Holmes, and others, shows that the Maya people, at\r\nthe time they were crushed by the more than cruel Spanish invasion, had\r\nreached a stage in their development but little short of true\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\n_Ethnological Studies._--The native dress of the Indians, their boats,\r\nornaments, and still more their customs, systems of government,\r\nreligions, myths, traditions, etc., offer attractive subjects for study,\r\nwhich are being earnestly pursued by many students at the present time.\r\nThe closing decade of the nineteenth century witnessed a true awakening\r\nof the white people of America to an interest in the many relics\r\nof ancient earthworks, buildings, utensils, etc., found throughout the\r\ncontinent, and a healthy growth of an earnest desire to record all that\r\ncan be learned concerning the representatives still remaining of the\r\nvanished peoples to whom they pertain.\r\n\r\nIn the van of this important work is the Bureau of Ethnology of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution. Important work has also been carried on by the\r\nPeabody Museum of Archaeology, situated at Cambridge, and more recently\r\nhas been taken up in an energetic manner by the American Museum in New\r\nYork and the Field Columbian Museum at Chicago. The National Museum of\r\nMexico has assembled rich stores of archaeological and ethnological\r\nmaterial pertaining to the native races of Mexico, and the Mexican\r\nGovernment is doing much to preserve the priceless prehistoric monuments\r\nof the republic from vandalism. There are also many private antiquarian\r\ncollections and many individual students who are doing good work along\r\ntheir chosen historic, linguistic, and other branches of research. One\r\nphase of this work, particularly in reference to ancient earthworks,\r\nbuildings, and also the observations of early travellers, missionaries,\r\nexplorers, etc., is the removal of the incrustation of romance, and in\r\npart of fable, that has been formed about them. As shown by W. H.\r\nHolmes, in reference to many reputed finds of the relics of men in\r\nvarious glacial and other deposits; by W. H. Henshaw, in respect to\r\ncertain animal carvings; by Cyrus Thomas, in the case of the earthwork\r\nof the eastern part of the United States; by L. H. Morgan, in connection\r\nwith the history of the Mexican and Central American aborigines and\r\nother similar examples, imagination has only too frequently taken the\r\nplace of critical study and hasty generalizations have been given\r\npublicity. It is perhaps not too strong a statement to say that the\r\nfascinating histories pertaining to Mexico and Central America, written\r\nby Irving, Prescott, and Bancroft, need to be thoroughly revised and\r\nrewritten from the standpoint of the scientific ethnologist. This\r\nclearing of the field of an underbrush of fancy is as necessary as the\r\nwork of the axe or _machete_ in removing the vegetable growths\r\nthat conceal many of the records of America's history.\r\n\r\n_The Contact of the Aborigines with Foreign Peoples._--The chief\r\ninterest of the ethnologist concerning the American aborigines relates\r\nto their condition before the introduction of European ideas and\r\ncustoms. This external influence has been far-reaching and cumulative in\r\nits effects, and to-day there is not a tribe in North America that\r\nstands where it would have stood but for its coming. Among some of the\r\nEskimo tribes, and in the case also of certain Indian communities in\r\ncentral Alaska and northern Canada, there have been but slight\r\nmodifications even in dress, utensils, etc., by reason of contact with\r\nthe white man. The Pueblo Indians have been resistant to change, but\r\nalthough still grinding their blue corn in primitive stone hand-mills,\r\nand dressed nearly as the first Spanish visitors found their ancestors\r\nin the same villages, there has been a slowly progressing revolution in\r\nthe undercurrent of their thought, ideas, religion, customs, etc.\r\nWhether this change is for the better or the worse depends on the point\r\nof view. In attempting to judge of it from the Indian's side, the only\r\npossible conclusion seems to be that the coming of the white man has\r\nbeen a curse.\r\n\r\nThe reception of Europeans by the Indian, although in many instances\r\nkindly, has, in the main, been but an outward show of friendship,\r\nconcealing suspicion, fear, and jealousy. That this distrust was well\r\nfounded is abundantly proved by history. Since the slaughter and\r\nenslavement of the aborigines of the West Indies and of the southern\r\nportion of the continent by Spaniards, through all the bloody conflicts\r\nof the English and French with the Indians of the Atlantic and\r\nMississippi regions, to near the close of the nineteenth century, almost\r\nconstant war, marauding, murder, rapine, and jealousy have accompanied\r\nthe contact of the aborigines and the whites. Although the Indians\r\nsucceeded in retarding the spread of civilization, they were not strong\r\nenough to permanently check it. In the United States and Canada they\r\nhave been, to a great extent, dispossessed of their hunting-grounds by\r\nso-called treaties, or by formal purchase, and placed on\r\nreservations. In Mexico the struggle is still in active progress, but\r\nthere and in Central America and the West Indies the contact of the two\r\nraces has in part assumed a different phase, and one less visibly\r\ndetrimental to the Indian. In the countries now held by people of\r\nSpanish descent, and in fact throughout Latin America, as it is termed,\r\namalgamation has, to a great extent, caused the disappearance of the\r\nIndian race in its purity. North of the indefinite boundary where the\r\nSpanish language is largely spoken much less admixture of the two races\r\nhas occurred than farther south, and the half-breed is classed as an\r\nIndian. While to the north of Mexico it is possible to trace the\r\npost-Columbian histories of the Indian tribes with an approach to\r\ncompleteness and to state their present census, and note the results of\r\nthe attempts that have been made to civilize them, to the south of the\r\nMexican boundary such a task is seemingly hopeless.\r\n\r\nIn Alaska the Indians still roam at large with no other restraint than\r\nthat arising from the adjustment reached through intertribal relations,\r\nwith slight modifications due to the widely scattered settlements of\r\nwhite men. No attempt has been made by the United States Government to\r\nplace them on reservations, and this will probably not occur, as the\r\nwhite man does not wish their lands for agricultural purposes.\r\nDisplacement by contact seems to express the change now in progress.\r\n\r\nIn Canada the present condition of the Indians varies with locality. In\r\nthe southeastern part, including the maritime provinces, they have been\r\ngreatly changed from their native condition, and to a large extent\r\ngathered on reservations or have settled on land of their own and become\r\nself-sustaining. In the Labrador region and throughout the Rocky\r\nMountains they still roam at will, and depend mainly on hunting and\r\nfishing for a livelihood. On the Pacific coast, the Haidas, etc., of\r\nBritish Columbia--and the same is true of their neighbours, the Tlingits\r\nof southeastern Alaska--have become interested as labourers in the\r\ncommercial fisheries, principally the salmon industry.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Government has purchased extensive tracts of land\r\nfrom the Indians, and the purchase money, together with the returns from\r\nthe sale of relinquished lands, etc., amounting in 1900 to $3,893,623,\r\nis held in trust for their benefit. The interest on this sum, together\r\nwith appropriations made by the Government for the support, education,\r\netc., of the Indians, amounted during the year 1900 to $1,309,127. The\r\ntotal--in part estimated--Indian population of Canada is about 99,000,\r\nand those classed as resident Indians number 77,450. The last-named\r\nduring the year 1900 cultivated 108,850 acres of land; owned 83,019 head\r\nof cattle, horses, sheep, etc.; cut 68,395 tons of hay; gathered 471,596\r\nbushels of potatoes and other root crops, besides an output of\r\n$1,639,398 worth of fish, furs, etc. During the same year 9,634 Indian\r\nchildren attended industrial schools. This is certainly a creditable\r\nreport and one encouraging to the hope that all the Indians in Canada\r\nwill in the course of a few generations become civilized, in spite of\r\nthe fact that the Indians outside of the reservations and beyond the\r\nlimits of the treaty lands still roam at large and to a great extent are\r\nin a deplorable condition.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of the aborigines within her borders Canada has to a\r\nmarked degree been both humane and just. Her policy in this connection\r\nis largely an inheritance from that of the Hudson's Bay Company, whose\r\nsuccess in trade depended on maintaining friendly relations with the\r\nnative peoples. The work of the factors of \"the Great Company\" scattered\r\nthroughout Canada and carried on continuously for more than two\r\ncenturies did much to prepare the aborigines for civil government. Owing\r\nlargely, also, to the efficiency of the mounted police of Canada much\r\nless trouble has been experienced in the management of the Indians of\r\nthat country than has been the case in the adjacent portion of the\r\nUnited States. In any comparison, however, of the relation of the\r\nCanadian and United States governments to the aborigines within their\r\nrespective borders account needs to be taken of the widely different\r\nconditions on the opposite sides of the boundary line between them. Not\r\nonly are the Indians of Canada about one-third as numerous as in the\r\nUnited States, while the area of each country is about the same,\r\nbut owing to a less dense white population to the north of the\r\ninternational boundary, far less demand has there arisen for their lands\r\nfor agricultural, mining, and other purposes than in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Indian problem within the United States has been a most serious one,\r\nand is still a severe tax on the nation. The union of the colonies and\r\nthe final separation from the mother country left the United States with\r\nan immense western frontier, extending in an irregular way from north to\r\nsouth through the trackless forests of the Mississippi Valley. As the\r\nnation grew in strength this frontier was pressed farther and farther\r\nwestward, while settlements established on the Pacific coast presented a\r\nfrontier to the eastward. These two inundations of civilization, crude,\r\nbut virile and aggressive, approached each other and entered the passes\r\nin the mountains separating them. Between the two were the\r\nhunting-grounds of the Indians, but the advance of the whites was\r\nirregular and the outposts of civilization were in the Indian country.\r\nIn 1867 the buildings of the first of the transcontinental railroads\r\ndivided the region roamed over by savage tribes. Railroads continued to\r\nbe built, and presently there was no frontier. In a later stage in this\r\nprocess of subduing a continent it became imperative that the more\r\nhostile and treacherous Indian tribes should be either exterminated or\r\nsegregated and confined to definite regions, where they could be under\r\nmilitary surveillance. Many treaties were made between the United States\r\nand the Indians, and by this means and by force the original occupants\r\nof the land were placed on reservations. The aim of the Government, it\r\nmust be conceded, has during the past fifty years or more been humane,\r\nbut in many instances treaties have been unfulfilled, and individuals in\r\nauthority have proved incompetent, unfaithful, and dishonest. In judging\r\nof the dealings of the white man with the Indian, it must be remembered\r\nthat the problem was highly complex and in certain ways of such a nature\r\nthat no result just to each party was practicable. On one hand, the\r\nrights of the Indian to the land they inherited from their ancestors was\r\nto be recognised, but a larger interest, the march of civilization, had\r\nalso to be encouraged. The good of humanity demanded that the barbarian,\r\nroaming over broad lands of which he made no use except for hunting,\r\nshould give place to more enlightened people, who wished to cultivate\r\nthe soil and make it support thousands of individuals, where before only\r\na few hundred could find sustenance. The history pertaining to so many\r\ncountries, where civilized peoples have displaced races in the lower\r\nstages of culture, was here repeated. The main issue was the same, only\r\nthe details differ. In the struggle between the white and the red man it\r\nbecame evident that the latter must yield, assume habits of industry,\r\nand earn his bread by the sweat of his brow or be exterminated. It may\r\nbe said that neither of these seemingly inevitable results has occurred;\r\nthe Indian has not been exterminated, and possibly not seriously reduced\r\nin numbers, and to a great extent is not self-supporting. It is\r\nbelieved, however, that this is but a transient stage, resulting from\r\nthe reservation system. In a large number of instances the lands\r\nformerly occupied by the Indians have been purchased from them by the\r\nGovernment and thrown open to settlement by white people. The money due\r\nfor these purchases has in several instances been paid to the Indians,\r\neither as tribes or individually, while in other cases it is still held\r\nin trust by the Government, and the interest on it used for the benefit\r\nof the original occupants of the land.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government by treaty with certain of the tribes, as\r\nthe Sioux, for example, has agreed to pay definite annuities and issue\r\nto each individual a certain amount of clothing and food each year.\r\nOther tribes placed on reservations were also granted clothing and food\r\nsufficient to keep them from want, although no agreement to that effect\r\nwas entered into, the theory of the Government being that the Indians\r\ndeprived of their hunting-grounds should receive aid until they could\r\nadopt the ways of civilized men sufficiently to be self-supporting. The\r\nnumber of Indians assisted in this way each year during the past decade\r\nhas been about 85,000. The food issued, usually twice a month, consists\r\nof meat, either beef or its equivalent in bacon, flour, coffee,\r\nand sugar. The ration supplied each individual is sufficient to maintain\r\na person, or at least keep him from starving, but is not intended to\r\nmeet all his wants. The desire on the part of the Government that want\r\nshould compel the Indian to work, has been still further pressed by a\r\ngradual decrease in the ration issued in certain instances where\r\ndefinite agreement has not been made and where a tendency to\r\nself-support is manifest. In general, however, this assistance, instead\r\nof stimulating industry, and, as would seem natural, gradually leading\r\nthe recipient to desire and obtain more and more of the comforts and\r\nluxuries that may be had as a reward of exertion, served but to enhance\r\nhis inherited aversion to all forms of labour. The issuing of rations\r\neven to the extent of insuring the Indian against starvation has to a\r\ngreat extent removed the incentive to industry, and the Indian, being an\r\nIndian, has remained thriftless and indifferent. The reservation system,\r\nso far as attaining the main aim in view, namely, the civilizing of the\r\nIndian and encouraging him to work, has, to a great extent, been a\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the issuing of food and clothing, the Government, with\r\nthe view of extending still further encouragement, has in a large number\r\nof instances provided the Indians with tools, horses, agricultural\r\nimplements, etc., and aided in irrigation and other schemes tending to\r\nthe improvement of the lands comprised in reservations.\r\n\r\nBesides the direct material aid just referred to, schools have been\r\nestablished, and an earnest and widely extended effort made to educate\r\nthe Indians and make them worthy of citizenship. The result of this\r\neffort, while highly encouraging in many individual instances, has on\r\nthe whole fallen far short of what was expected in view of the large\r\nexpenditures incurred. The sum thus employed during the past\r\nthirty-three years is about $240,000,000. The total appropriation made\r\nby the Government for the care and education of the Indians, inclusive\r\nof the aborigines of Alaska, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1901,\r\nwas over $9,000,000. Of this sum, over one-third was expended in the\r\nmaintenance of schools. In addition to this provision there are a number\r\nof mission and other schools, supported mainly by religious or\r\nbenevolent organizations, and certain public schools not receiving aid\r\nfrom the General Government which were wholly or in part for the benefit\r\nof Indian pupils.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the larger of the Government Indian schools the Indian\r\nchildren are removed from their homes and placed in institutions where\r\nthey live for a period of four years under military discipline. In these\r\nschools literary is subordinate to industrial training. The majority of\r\nthe schools are equipped with shops for shoe- and harness-making,\r\ncarpentry, blacksmithing, wagon-making, etc., and in several instances\r\nthe girls are taught cooking and house-work. The largest of these\r\nschools is situated at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, at which the average\r\nattendance during the year 1900 was 961. The extent to which education\r\nis spreading through the Indian tribes and its rate of increase are\r\nindicated by the fact that the attendance on the Government schools has\r\nincreased from 3,598 in 1877 to 21,566 in 1900.\r\n\r\nWhile the benefits received by the Indians through the issuing of\r\nclothing, rations, and by education has been great and the seed for\r\nfuture progress sown broadcast, the results, so far as lifting the\r\nrecipients into an atmosphere of refinement and civilization and making\r\nthem self-supporting are concerned, are far from encouraging. The\r\nIndians in general are still wards of the Government and not worthy of\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the Government is not only to educate the Indians, but to\r\ninduce them to adopt the ways of industrious and progressive white men,\r\nbuild homes on land ceded to them and which they may hold as\r\nindividuals, thus breaking up their long-established practise of\r\ncommunal or tribe ownership, and finally become citizens of the\r\nrepublic. To this end land has been divided among the heads of families\r\nof several tribes and titles in severalty granted, with restrictions in\r\nmost, if not all instances, in reference to the sale of the land within\r\na certain period. In many instances this plan has been productive of\r\ngood results, and the Indians have become industrious and to a large\r\nextent citizens. The numerous successes that have followed the\r\nallotment of land in severalty, accompanied as it is with\r\nresponsibilities and the necessity of self-support, is encouraging and\r\nleads to the hope that in the course of a few generations all the\r\nIndians will have passed from the condition of barbarism to one of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico since 1824 the Indians have been on the same political basis\r\nas the whites, although to a great extent they have failed to profit by\r\ntheir advantages, and so far as legal restrictions are concerned are\r\neligible to any office of the republic. The brightest example of the\r\nwisdom of this policy is furnished by the fact that in at least one\r\ninstance a man of pure Aztec blood has occupied the highest office in\r\nthe gift of the people. In general, and in fact almost universally, the\r\nposition of the Indian in Mexico is that of a farm labourer, but\r\nalthough nominally free, owing to a prevalent system of debt, he is\r\nreally held in vassalage by the owners of the large plantations or\r\n_haciendas_. In many ways his condition is but little better than that\r\nof a slave. Unlike the roaming tribes of the more northern portion of\r\nthe continent, where the food supply fluctuates greatly with the\r\nseasons, the natives of Mexico early became sedentary, and, owing no\r\ndoubt in part to the density of the population, became horticulturists,\r\nand have continued to cultivate the soil to the present day. They are\r\nnow essentially agriculturists, wedded to their place of birth, and not\r\nonly do not desire change, but repel by passive resistance the invasion\r\nof civilization and the use of new and improved tools and machinery.\r\nThey are non-progressive, and on account of their great numbers,\r\nconstituting about 38 per cent of the entire population, serve to retard\r\nadvancement in a manner that is highly detrimental to the enlightened\r\nand progressive members of the ruling class. Education in nearly all\r\nparts of the republic is compulsory and the schools free. With both\r\npolitical and educational advantages, however, but indifferent progress\r\ntowards civilization has been made.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the Indians throughout Central America is\r\nsimilar to that of the descendants of the Aztecs and other tribes in\r\nMexico both politically and socially. They are a disheartened\r\nrace, living in a region where exuberant nature supplies their small\r\nwants with but little exertion on their part, and incentives to activity\r\neither of body or mind are, to a great extent, lacking.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies the native Caribs were nearly exterminated by the\r\nSpaniards early in their occupation of the islands, their places as\r\nlabourers being supplied by the importation of negro slaves, and at the\r\npresent time but few, if any, Indians of pure blood are to be found.\r\nThroughout Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies amalgamation of\r\nthe Indian with both Europeans and negroes has taken place, and a mixed\r\nrace, consisting of a large percentage of the total population, has\r\nresulted. In Mexico these _mestizos_, as they are termed, number about\r\n5,000,000, or about two-fifths of the entire population. In the Central\r\nAmerican republics the supplanting of the aboriginal race by the same\r\nprocess is thought to have progressed at about the same rate as in\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nTo the student of geography a comparison of the state of the aborigines\r\nof North America before peoples from other lands came among them, with\r\nreference to the influence of environment, is full of significance. The\r\nhighest degree of culture and the greatest advance towards refinement\r\nwas in Mexico and Central America, where a uniform climate prevails and\r\nbodily wants are few and easily supplied. It was there that skill in\r\narchitecture reached its highest development, and what is worthy the\r\nname of art, and we may almost say letters, but in truth\r\npicture-writing, reached a high degree of advancement.\r\n\r\nThis marked progress in a tropical country beyond what was attained by\r\nthe Indian tribes in the temperate and cold portions of the continent\r\nseems to be an exception to the general rule that intellectual progress\r\nis stimulated by changeable climatic conditions, and reaches the highest\r\ndevelopment in cold, temperate climates. Apparently the degree of\r\nstimulation needed for the Caucasian and the Indian differs, and the\r\nlatter thrives best where the obstacles to be overcome are least. This\r\nis in harmony with the oft-repeated statement that the Indian is but a\r\nchild. The struggle which would discourage the boy is but zest to\r\nthe man. Among the Indians themselves, however, we find an exception to\r\nthe rule suggested in the fact that the Iroquois or the Six Nations of\r\nNew York, in their tribal organization and alliances of offence and\r\ndefence probably surpassed even the Aztecs and Mayas. In physical\r\nstrength and endurance, and in mental powers, so far as government and\r\noratory are concerned, the Iroquois probably surpassed all other\r\nIndians; but in architecture, art, picture-writing, etc., they were far\r\nthe inferiors of the Mexican and Central American Indians. Thus,\r\nintellectual strength and vigour seem to have been most markedly a\r\nproduct of the colder and more changeable climate, while the highest\r\nattainment in architecture, etc., was reached at the south.\r\n\r\nIt is in the temperate region also that the best results have been\r\nreached in attempting to civilize the Indians. This, however, cannot be\r\nclaimed as a result of climate simply, since the aid that has been\r\nextended to them in Canada and the United States is far different from\r\nthe influence exerted on their relatives at the south by men of Spanish\r\nblood. The results of the efforts of Canada and the United States to\r\ncivilize the Indian and make him worthy of citizenship, although costly\r\nand slow in reaching the desired end, are full of promise. By the\r\nmethods referred to in the last few pages a strong effort is being made\r\nto counteract the harsh treatment the Indians received during the\r\nearlier years of French and English aggression, and to give them a fair\r\nchance to advance. One important result of the present firm control is\r\nthe total cessation of intertribal warfare. Seemingly the aborigines\r\nthroughout North America, with the exception--and it is hoped this is\r\nbut temporary--of the Alaskan Eskimos and the still uncared-for Indian\r\ntribes of Alaska and Canada, should increase in numbers as well as in\r\nenlightenment. In reference to numbers, the enumerations that have been\r\nmade in recent years, although not exact, seem to indicate a diminution\r\nin the rate of decrease, if not a positive advance. In the case of most\r\nof the Indian tribes north of Mexico the change from a free life, passed\r\nto a large extent in tents or temporary homes, to an inactive,\r\nsedentary existence, mostly on reservations, and the influences of\r\nhouse-life without a knowledge of sanitary conditions was a most severe\r\none. The adverse results of this change, it is probable, are not yet\r\npast, but the rate of decrease in numbers resulting from it appears to\r\nbe diminishing. Aside from the comparative suddenness with which the\r\nIndian has been forced to change his ways of thinking and living, it\r\nmust be confessed that there is something inherent in his mental\r\nqualities that makes him unduly resistant to progress. As a race it is\r\nnot to be hoped that he can ever be placed on really equal terms with\r\nthe white man.\r\n\r\nThe total aboriginal population of North America in 1900, as nearly as\r\nit is now practicable to ascertain, is shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n              { Canada, Arctic coast                      1,000\r\n    Eskimos.  { Newfoundland (Labrador coast)               800\r\n              { United States, Alaska (1890)             14,000\r\n                                                     ----------\r\n                    Total Eskimo population, about       15,800\r\n\r\n              { Canada                                   99,010\r\n              { United States, exclusive of Alaska      270,544\r\n    Indians.  { \"        \"     Alaska                    15,500\r\n              { Mexico (1895)                         5,000,000\r\n              { Central America (largely estimated)   1,600,000\r\n                                                      ---------\r\n                  Total Indian population, about      6,985,054\r\n                                                      ---------\r\n                  Total aboriginal population, about  7,000,800\r\n\r\nIn this enumeration no account is taken of the Indians of the West\r\nIndies, for the reason, so far as can be learned, that there are few, if\r\nany, of pure blood remaining.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LITERATURE\r\n\r\n  Vast stores of information concerning the aborigines of America\r\n    have been published by the Bureau of American Ethnology,\r\n    Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.

Similar information concerning the natives of\r\n     Canada may be found in the reports on Indian affairs issued by\r\n     the Canadian Government at Ottawa.\r\n\r\n     Of the numerous books on ethnology in which the relation of the\r\n     aborigines of America to other peoples is discussed, perhaps\r\n     the most useful to the general reader is A.

The portions of the\r\noriginal manuscript referred to relate to the geography of fisheries,\r\nforestry, mining, commerce, agriculture, etc. In discussing each of\r\nthese themes, the control exerted by natural conditions or environment\r\non human affairs made itself prominent because of the immediate\r\ninfluence of corrective failures when nature's laws are disregarded. A\r\nless attractive phase of the study of the relation of man to nature is\r\nfurnished by political geography, in which the influence of something\r\nopposed to environment becomes prominent, and as history shows has in\r\nthe main exerted a major control over the geography of nations. That\r\nsomething, as is well known, is the greed of peoples. Space is here\r\nclaimed for a part of my original manuscript for the reason that it\r\npresents a view of political adjustments not usually taken and in a way\r\nperhaps pessimistical, which may awaken opposition, and also because it\r\ncontains a summary of the results of a long series of struggles among\r\nvarious nations for the possession of the North American continent. Of\r\ngreater moment than the rivalries of nations for territory, as is also\r\noutlined, is the conflict between two radically different principles of\r\ngovernment--the monarchical and the republican--in which this continent\r\nhas furnished the chief battle-grounds. Did space permit, the influence\r\nof geographical conditions on the growth and development of the\r\nfundamental ideas of government could be illustrated by American\r\nhistory, and the probability that environment will in the end gain\r\nascendency over local self-interests in the establishing of national\r\nboundaries made prominent.\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent facts dealt with in the study of political geography\r\nand of history are the territorial limits of nations. For this reason\r\nthe characteristics of boundaries are of fundamental importance, and a\r\nclassification of them is convenient, if not essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CLASSIFICATION OF BOUNDARIES\r\n\r\nThe boundaries between nations, states, provinces, etc., established in\r\nvarious ways, may be classified, at least provisionally, in six\r\ngroups. We may term these groups _coast boundaries_, _astronomical\r\nboundaries_, _water boundaries_, _mountain boundaries_, _divide\r\nboundaries_, and _arbitrary boundaries_.\r\n\r\n_Coast Boundaries._--The junction of the sea and land on the borders of\r\ncontinents and islands furnishes natural and sharply defined lines,\r\nwhich are clearly the most desirable of any of the various classes of\r\nboundaries for defining political limits. By international consent the\r\njurisdiction of a country bordering on the \"high seas\" is a line one\r\nmarine league seaward from the margin of the land, and following its\r\nmeanders. As an international dividing line the one-league limit seldom,\r\nif ever, becomes important, since the nice adjustment of the width of an\r\narm of the sea necessary for such a purpose rarely occurs. When an\r\nextension of the ocean's waters intervening between two nations is less\r\nthan two marine leagues wide the boundary between them commonly follows\r\nits medial line, and has all the essential features of a water boundary,\r\ndescribed below.\r\n\r\n_Astronomical Boundaries._--The shape of the earth and its motions in\r\nreference to the sun are such that certain imaginary lines on its\r\nsurface may be located with precision by astronomers, and if the\r\nmonuments or other marks employed to show the positions of such lines\r\nare removed they can be accurately relocated. The lines referred to are\r\nprincipally parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude, and\r\nboundaries, so far as they coincide with these lines, may for\r\nconvenience be classed as astronomical boundaries.\r\n\r\nExamples of the class of boundaries here indicated are furnished by the\r\none defining the east border of the main body of Alaska, which, as\r\ndefined in a treaty made in 1825 between Great Britain and Russia, is\r\nthe one hundred and forty-first meridian west of Greenwich; and by the\r\nboundary between Canada and the continental portion of the United States\r\nfrom near the Lake of the Woods westward to the coast of the continent,\r\nwhich, as finally decided in a treaty between Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States in 1846, is the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude.\r\nThe boundaries of a number of the States of the United States and of\r\nseveral of the provinces of Canada are either wholly or in part\r\nparallels of latitude or meridians of longitude, and furnish good\r\nexamples of what are here termed astronomical boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous advantages of astronomical boundaries are that they\r\nmay be accurately described without a knowledge of the country through\r\nwhich they pass. They can be located with precision and their courses\r\naccurately marked by monuments. For these reasons astronomical\r\nboundaries, when clearly defined in treaties between nations or in laws\r\nconcerning the territorial limits of states or provinces, leave no room\r\nfor contention as to their positions.\r\n\r\nThe leading objections to the use of astronomical boundaries,\r\nparticularly as international dividing lines, are: The temptation they\r\noffer to diplomats and others, who may be interested in the speedy\r\nconclusion of a treaty, to make hasty divisions of territory without\r\nknowing its resources or commercial and other possibilities. Then, too,\r\nsuch boundaries cross the land without reference to its topography, and\r\nhave no essential relations to the courses of streams or the directions\r\nof coast-lines, etc. They may divide a fruitful valley in a most\r\narbitrary and inconvenient manner between two nations with widely\r\ndifferent laws and customs, or cross a navigable river at several\r\nlocalities, and intersect a coast or lake shore so as to initiate\r\ncomplex conditions in respect to harbours, navigation, customs duties,\r\netc. In these and still other ways boundaries coinciding with lines of\r\nlatitude and longitude are apt to bring about detrimental commercial and\r\nother relations between adjacent nations, states, and provinces. A\r\nregion which is an industrial unit--as the gold fields of the Klondike\r\ndistrict, the iron-bearing tracts to the west of Lake Superior, the\r\nwheat-lands of the Red River Valley, the forested lands of the northwest\r\ncoast, etc.--when divided between two or more countries with different\r\nlaws is deprived of the advantages that should follow from the natural\r\ncourse of industrial development, and one part or the other suffers in\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.--Distribution of governments in North\r\nAmerica.]\r\n\r\nAgain, until an astronomical boundary is surveyed and marked on\r\nthe ground by skilled geodesists, it cannot be located even\r\napproximately by miners, trappers, foresters, and others, and many\r\ndifficulties are apt to arise in this connection.\r\n\r\nAlthough an astronomical boundary once decided on and formally recorded\r\nin a treaty leaves no excuse for national quarrels as to its position,\r\nit is evident that its far-reaching and perhaps highly complex\r\ninfluences on the development of neighbouring peoples are likely to be\r\nsuch that the natural resources, conditions affecting transportation,\r\netc., of the region through which it passes should be thoroughly\r\nunderstood before a final decision is reached.\r\n\r\n_Water Boundaries._--In numerous instances the medial line or one shore\r\nof a stream, lake, estuary, strait, or other water body not recognised\r\nas a part of the \"high seas\" has been selected to serve as a fence\r\nbetween nations and states; collectively, such boundaries, typically\r\nrepresented by a river without islands, flowing between well-defined and\r\npermanent banks, may conveniently be termed water boundaries. In\r\ngeneral, when a stream, lake, etc., is a national or state boundary, its\r\nmedial line, or the centre of the deepest channel when there is more\r\nthan one, is defined as the precise line of demarcation.\r\n\r\nThe leading features of water boundaries are illustrated by a portion of\r\nthe line separating the United States from Canada, which traverses the\r\nmiddle of the St. Lawrence River, and divides medially several of the\r\nGreat Lakes and their connecting streams. The south boundary of the\r\nUnited States is also in part a water boundary, and is defined by treaty\r\nas \"the middle line of the Rio Grande, or its deepest channel where\r\nthere is more than one.\"\r\n\r\nIn certain instances, when a river, lake, bay, etc., separates two\r\npolitical organizations, one shore or the other may be defined by treaty\r\nor by law as the actual line of separation, and even complex relations\r\nmay exist, in reference to jurisdiction over the dividing waters. The\r\nwater boundary between New York and New Jersey, for example, is, in\r\npart, the middle line of the Hudson and of New York Bay, etc., with\r\nseveral qualifications, including exclusive jurisdiction by New\r\nYork over all the waters of the Hudson to the west of Manhattan Island\r\nto the low-water line on the New Jersey shore, subject, however, to\r\ncertain rights of property and of jurisdiction of the State of New\r\nJersey, etc. The waters of Delaware River are, by agreement between New\r\nJersey and Pennsylvania, a common highway, over which each State \"shall\r\nenjoy and exercise a concurrent jurisdiction within and upon the water,\r\nand not upon the dry land between the shores of said river\"; the islands\r\nin the river being specifically assigned to the one or the other State.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of a water boundary are suggested by the fact that in\r\nmost instances they may be easily located, even by persons inexperienced\r\nin the method of surveying. Coinciding, as they generally do, with\r\ndefinite geographical divisions, they do not lead in a conspicuous\r\nmanner to complications in the industrial development of the countries\r\nor States separated by them.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties to which water boundaries may give rise are indicated\r\nby the fact that streams, more particularly than the other water bodies\r\nin question, frequently divide so as to inclose islands, and in certain\r\ninstances on nearing the sea send off, perhaps, several distributaries,\r\nwhich discharge through independent mouths. When a stream divides so as\r\nto inclose an island, even if the main or the deepest channel is\r\nspecified by treaty or by law as the one chosen as a boundary, the\r\nquestion as to which of two channels is really the larger or the deeper\r\nmay not permit of definite answer. Streams are subject to many changes,\r\nand what is the main channel one year may become of secondary rank the\r\nnext year, or a river, as not infrequently happens, may shift its course\r\nbodily, and thus furnish grounds for contention as to the ownership of\r\nthe territory transferred from one of its banks to the other. The\r\ndistributaries of streams, or the separate channels into which they\r\ndivide on deltas, etc., are also subject to conspicuous and sometimes\r\nsudden changes. Who could decide, for instance, which is the main\r\nchannel of such rivers as the Mississippi, the Nile, or the Ganges, in\r\nthe delta portions of their courses; or if a choice seemed practicable,\r\nis there any assurance that the distributary largest to-day will\r\nmaintain its supremacy for a decade to come, or even be in existence a\r\ncentury hence?\r\n\r\nThe controversies that may arise in reference to which of two channels\r\nin a designated water body is the main one, are illustrated by the\r\nwell-known \"San Juan episode,\" which came near bringing on hostilities\r\nbetween Great Britain and the United States in reference to the\r\nownership of certain islands in the Strait of Georgia; the immediate\r\nsubject of contention being whether \"the channel which separates the\r\ncontinent from Vancouvers Island,\" as the statement reads in the\r\nWebster-Ashburton treaty, 1846, passes to the east or to the west of the\r\nSan Juan Islands. The Emperor of Germany, as is well known, acting as\r\narbitrator, decided that the islands belong to the United States. Thus,\r\nin 1872, a series of disputes as to the Canadian-United-States boundary,\r\nwhich had been carried on for ninety years, was closed.\r\n\r\nWhile water boundaries, and especially rivers, in certain instances,\r\nhave furnished almost ideal dividing lines between nations, in other\r\ninstances they have proved to be objectionable. The difference lies in\r\nthe nature of the streams themselves, and illustrates the fact that,\r\nwith water boundaries as with other classes of dividing lines between\r\nnations, a critical knowledge of the geography of the region through\r\nwhich they pass is a prerequisite of treaty making, if subsequent\r\nboundary disputes are to be avoided.\r\n\r\n_Mountain Boundaries._--The crests of mountain ranges, or mountain\r\nchains, are sometimes specified in treaties as defining territorial\r\nlimits. The ideal mountain range is one having a generally straight\r\nalignment and a continuous and sharply defined crest, but in nature this\r\nideal is seldom attained. Modern geographical studies have shown that\r\nmany so-called mountains, which from a distance appear to be\r\nwell-defined uplifts with sharp crest-lines, are in reality broad\r\nplateaus or great domes, deeply dissected by stream erosion. In such\r\ninstances it is frequently difficult to decide where the crest of the\r\nrange is located. Indeed, as is not infrequently the case, there is no\r\ndefinite and tangible crest-line. Although it is sometimes assumed that\r\nthe crest-line coincides with the water-parting, or the divide, between\r\nthe head branches of streams flowing in opposite directions from\r\na mountain-like uplift, it is well known that a mountain range, even\r\nwhen bold and sharply defined, may not be a divide for the principal\r\nstreams of the region where it is situated. An illustration in point is\r\nfurnished by the Appalachian Mountains, through which the Susquehanna,\r\nDelaware, and other important rivers rising in the plateau to the west\r\nflow transversely in deep valleys and empty into the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe recent controversy between Argentina and Chile was due to an\r\nassumption in a treaty between them that the crest-line of the southern\r\nAndes coincides with the water-parting between the streams flowing to\r\nthe Atlantic and those discharging into the Pacific. Post-treaty\r\nsurveys, as they may suggestively be termed, have shown that in the\r\nportion of the Andes in question streams rising well to the east of the\r\nmountains flow westward through them in deep transverse canyons, and that\r\nthere is a wide discrepancy between the continental water-parting and\r\nthe topographic crest-line of the continent.\r\n\r\nA mountain boundary, if defined as the line along which the upward\r\nslopes on the opposite sides of a prominent uplift meet in its summit\r\nportion, would in most instances be irregular and perhaps conspicuously\r\nintricate, for the reason that mountain crests are modified and shaped\r\nby erosion and migrate in one direction or another according to the\r\nstrength and other qualifying conditions of the opposite-flowing\r\nstreams. Then, too, an uplift which seems to a casual observer to be a\r\nsingle mountain range, may in reality be highly complex, and no\r\ncontinuous crest-line be discoverable. In short, the sweeping statements\r\nsometimes embodied in treaties, to the effect that the line of\r\ndemarcation between contiguous countries shall be the crest-line of a\r\ncertain indicated mountain range are fraught with uncertainties and\r\ndifficulties, which are likely to prove a source of discontent and\r\ncostly arbitration, or even lead to war.\r\n\r\n_Divide Boundaries._--A boundary which is defined as following a\r\nspecified water-parting or divide, from which streams flow in opposite\r\ndirections, would in most instances be easily traceable on the ground\r\neven by persons unskilled in the art of surveying, and for this\r\nand other reasons has much to commend it; yet, without an accurate\r\nknowledge, and most of all an accurate topographic map of the region\r\nthrough which such a boundary is to pass, its selection on general\r\nprinciples, however nicely worded, is open to dangers of the same nature\r\nas those pertaining to a similar choice of a mountain boundary.\r\n\r\nIn arid regions broad plateaus may form divides, and even an approximate\r\nlocation of the line of water-parting, if one exists, be a matter of\r\ndifficulty and uncertainty. Then, too, the process of head-water\r\ncorrasion pertaining to essentially all streams, and of stream capture,\r\nor the acquiring by one stream, through the process of stream\r\ndevelopment, of the territory formerly drained by its neighbour, leads\r\nto a migration and sometimes a sudden and perhaps extensive shifting of\r\na water-parting.\r\n\r\nExamples of divide boundaries are furnished by the one separating Idaho\r\nand Montana, which in part coincides with the continental divide, and\r\nserves its purpose well; but the satisfaction it has given is to be\r\nqualified by the fact that, for the most part, it is situated in a\r\nrugged region, where there is but slight probability of the property\r\ninterests of the communities parted by it coming into direct contact.\r\n\r\nBoundaries which are made to coincide with the courses of rivers, with\r\nthe crest-lines of mountains, or with water-partings, have certain\r\ncommendable features in common; they are easily located, readily defined\r\nby natural features of the earth's surface, and in general do not\r\nrequire to be accurately surveyed and marked by monuments before they\r\nserve their purpose as international or interstate fences.\r\n\r\n_Arbitrary Boundaries._--A class of boundaries not otherwise readily\r\ndefinable may be conveniently designated as arbitrary boundaries, since,\r\nas a rule, they are not described in terms such as pertain to\r\nastronomical boundaries, and bear no necessary relation to topographic\r\nor other features of the regions they traverse. Like astronomical\r\nboundaries, the ones here considered are imaginary lines, and, in part,\r\nmight with propriety be included in that class, since they are capable\r\nof being located by astronomical methods; but they serve our\r\npurpose better if considered in a group by themselves. The class of\r\nboundaries here referred to includes straight lines connecting two\r\npoints; lines defined as running in a given direction (azimuth) and for\r\ncertain distances; arcs of circles; tangents to circles, etc. In brief,\r\narbitrary boundaries may be defined as straight or curved lines or\r\ncombinations of such lines, and are similar to the lines employed by\r\nsurveyors in marking the boundaries of a farm, locating a railroad, etc.\r\n\r\nAn example of what is meant by an arbitrary boundary is furnished by the\r\nline separating Delaware from Pennsylvania, which is an arc of a circle\r\n12 miles in radius, with the steeple of the old court-house in\r\nNewcastle, Delaware, as a centre. Again, in the establishment of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, a rectangle 10 miles square was chosen and marked\r\non the ground by means of monuments as the site of the capital of the\r\nUnited States. Another illustration is furnished by the eastern boundary\r\nof California, as defined in its constitution. This boundary runs from\r\nthe intersection of 120 degrees of west longitude with the thirty-ninth\r\ndegree of north latitude in a straight line in a southeasterly direction\r\nto the River Colorado, at a point where it intersects the thirty-fifth\r\ndegree of north latitude.\r\n\r\nBoundaries of the nature just cited can only be recognised when actually\r\nmarked on the ground, and except in the case of straight lines, not of\r\ngreat length, or small geometrical figures, are difficult of precise\r\nlocation, even by skilled surveyors. Should the monuments used to define\r\ntheir positions be destroyed, their replacement is an arduous task.\r\n\r\nAn interesting example of a change from an astronomical to an arbitrary\r\nboundary is furnished by the line of demarcation between Texas and New\r\nMexico, which in part, as originally defined by law, was the one hundred\r\nand third meridian of west longitude, but owing to errors in the first\r\nsurvey was wrongly marked on the ground by monuments. The monuments,\r\nhowever, having been accepted as indicating the position of the true\r\nline of division, became points in an arbitrary boundary. Other similar\r\nexamples of the acceptance of an arbitrary in place of an\r\nastronomical boundary are not uncommon.\r\n\r\n_Impracticable Boundaries._--There are certain dividing lines which are\r\ndefined in treaties, decrees, etc., as running parallel to some natural\r\nfeature, as a coast or a river, and at a given distance from it, that\r\nmight with propriety be classed as arbitrary boundaries, since no effort\r\nis made to adjust them to the natural conditions of the immediate\r\nterritory they traverse; but, for the purpose of expressing a still\r\ngreater weakness inherent in them, they are here specially designated as\r\n_impracticable boundaries_. This, as is to be hoped, temporary class of\r\nboundaries includes the proposed lines of demarcation sometimes inserted\r\nin treaties, etc., which it is impossible, or at least impracticable,\r\nwithout great and for the most part useless expense of time and money,\r\nto mark on the ground, and thus seek to make serviceable.\r\n\r\nIn this connection reference may be made to the boundary between\r\nsoutheastern Alaska and Canada, which, as stated in the treaty between\r\nGreat Britain and Russia previously referred to, in the absence of a\r\nmountain range parallel with the coast and not over 10 marine leagues\r\ninland--and as subsequent explorations and surveys have shown such is\r\nthe case--\"shall be formed by a line parallel to the windings of the\r\ncoast, and which shall never exceed the distance of 10 marine leagues\r\ntherefrom.\" The region through which the line described would pass, if\r\nsurveyed, was almost entirely unknown at the time the treaty referred to\r\nwas made, but, as has since been discovered, it is exceedingly rugged,\r\nand contains many mountains ranging from 10,000 to 18,000 feet high,\r\nbesides a multitude of glaciers and many extensive fields of perpetual\r\nsnow. To survey and mark on the ground the boundary indicated in the\r\ntreaty would be what may be justly termed an impossible task; and,\r\nbesides, if the line as defined by treaty should be established, it\r\nwould be intricate, and much less serviceable as a national fence than\r\nany one of several possible boundaries that could have been chosen, with\r\nessentially the same end in view, at the time the original treaty was\r\nentered into, had a geographer been employed to make even a hasty\r\nreconnaissance of the region in question.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.--Characteristic vegetation.]\r\n\r\nAnother example of a boundary being defined as running parallel to and\r\nat a specified distance from an irregular geographical feature is\r\nfurnished by a part of the boundary between Massachusetts and New\r\nHampshire, which is a line parallel to the Merrimac River, and distant\r\nfrom it 3 miles on the north. In this case, although the distance of the\r\nline designated from the one to which it is to be drawn parallel is but\r\n3 miles, and the country between only mildly undulating or hilly, the\r\nboundary as now marked on the ground and accepted as an interstate\r\nboundary is but a rude approximation to the one originally defined.\r\n\r\nThese examples, and others that might with propriety be classified as\r\nimpracticable boundaries, illustrate again the desirability of accurate\r\ngeographical knowledge, and still more of an adequate appreciation of\r\nthe difficulties and limitations met with by the surveyor, on the part\r\nof those who attend to the real-estate business of nations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe line of separation between Canada and the United States, as defined\r\nby the Treaty of Ghent, 1814, and after several subsequent adjustments,\r\nwas determined as indicated roughly on the accompanying map. Throughout\r\nthe greater part of its eastern half it is a river boundary, and in its\r\nwestern half an astronomical boundary.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the English Government granted Newfoundland jurisdiction over\r\nLabrador, and in letters patent defined that dependency as \"all the\r\ncoast of Labrador, from the entrance of Hudson Straits to a line to be\r\ndrawn due north and south from Ause Sableu on the said coast to the\r\nfifty-second degree of north latitude, and all the islands adjacent to\r\nthat part of the said coast of Labrador.\" This line is still unsurveyed.\r\nFrom the fifty-second parallel to the Strait of Belle Isle, a distance\r\nof about 40 miles, the boundary is a north-and-south line situated about\r\n7 miles west of the fifty-seventh meridian, as is indicated on the best\r\nmaps available.\r\n\r\nThe southern boundary of the United States, as finally determined in\r\n1853 by treaty with Mexico, is, beginning at the east, a river\r\nboundary for some 900 miles, namely, the middle of the Rio Grande, or\r\nits deepest channel, when there is more than one, to where the river\r\ncrosses the parallel of latitude 31 deg. 47'; continuing westward, the line\r\nis in part an astronomical and in part an arbitrary boundary to the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the boundaries separating the several provinces of Canada,\r\nthe various States of the United States and of Mexico, the republics of\r\nCentral America, etc., are indicated approximately on the accompanying\r\nmap. These lines when studied on larger-scale maps on which the drainage\r\nand relief are also shown reveal many features of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          POLITICAL CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe political subdivisions of North America in 1900 are too well known\r\nto require specific description at this time. The long-continued\r\nstruggles and rivalries that have led to the present subdivision of\r\nterritory pertain to history, and although full of interest from the\r\npoint of view of the geographer, cannot be discussed in the present\r\ntreatise. Among the conspicuous events that might be shown by a series\r\nof political maps is the contraction and final disappearance of Spanish\r\nand French dominion from the continental mainland. The broad, indefinite\r\nterritory once belonging to Spain, which in the sixteenth century seemed\r\ndestined to expand still more and possibly embrace the whole of the two\r\nAmericas, has been diminished from time to time, until as a result of\r\nthe recent Spanish-American War her flag no longer waves over any\r\nportion of the New World. The French territory, once embracing a large\r\nportion of what is now Canada and the United States, is at present\r\nrepresented by the islands Martinique and Guadeloupe with its\r\ndependencies, in the West Indies, and the islands Miquelon and St.\r\nPierre, adjacent to the south coast of Newfoundland; in all, comprising\r\nabout 1,161 square miles. The French have, in addition, certain treaty\r\nrights pertaining to fisheries on the northern and western shores of\r\nNewfoundland.\r\n\r\nBetween the two forms of government, monarchical and republican,\r\nNorth America is somewhat equally divided, so far as extent of territory\r\nis concerned (Plate VII), but not as respects population. The people\r\nunder republican organization far outnumber those still acknowledging\r\nallegiance to hereditary rulers. The countries self-governed, or forming\r\nparts of American republics, embraced in 1900 all of the continental\r\nmainland south of the United-States-Canadian boundary, together with\r\nAlaska, Cuba, San Domingo and Haiti, and Porto Rico. The provinces,\r\nislands, etc., still controlled by European powers are Canada,\r\nNewfoundland, Bermuda, and all of the West Indies except the islands\r\njust referred to, which are more definitely designated in the table on\r\npage 424. The population of the American republics is in the\r\nneighbourhood of 97,000,000, and of the European dependencies somewhat\r\nless than 7,000,000. A republican form of government, more or less\r\ndefinitely foreshadowed by the tribal confederations of the aborigines,\r\nthe most conspicuous example of which is furnished by the Iroquois or\r\n\"Six Nations,\" has thus become the characteristic feature of the\r\npolitical organizations of North America; the same is true also of South\r\nAmerica. The New World is thus conspicuously republican, in distinction\r\nfrom the Old World, which is characteristically monarchical.\r\n\r\nThe immigration to North America since its discovery by Columbus has\r\nbeen from all the nations of the Old World, but most largely from\r\nEurope. Negroes were brought as slaves, and their descendants, now free,\r\nform a large percentage of the population, especially in the\r\nsoutheastern part of the United States and the West Indies. Chinese,\r\nsince about 1870, have arrived in large numbers, but their immigration\r\nto the United States is now restricted. Of the nations of Europe, the\r\nstrongest influx has come from Great Britain, France, Germany, Spain,\r\nand Italy. To a marked degree this westward migration has been along\r\nparallels of latitude, but the migratory streams on reaching North\r\nAmerica subdivided into many distributaries, and a mingling of\r\nnationalities on a vast scale has resulted. This amalgamation has been\r\nso great and so long-continued that several new and somewhat strongly\r\nindividualized nationalities have arisen, the most instructive\r\nbeing in the temperate portion of the continent.\r\n\r\nThe dominant language, as in the case of political control, has been\r\ninherited from Great Britain. English is the universal language to the\r\nnorthward of Mexico and on certain of the West Indian islands. To the\r\nsouth of the United-States-Mexican boundary, but beginning in the\r\nsouthwestern portion of the United States, and including also the\r\ngreater part of the population of the West Indies, Spanish is the\r\ncurrent language, except among the uncivilized aborigines. French is\r\ncommonly spoken by many thousands of people in the province of Quebec,\r\nCanada, and in certain of the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe ideal nation, from the point of view of the geographer, is one so\r\nsituated that it is self-sustaining--that is, contains within its own\r\ndomain all the conditions necessary for its life and growth. It should\r\nhave favourable climatic conditions, agricultural land, forests, mines,\r\nfisheries, etc. More than this, even if all material wants are supplied\r\nfrom within its own border, intellectual desires demand outside stimuli.\r\nThe ideal nation should therefore touch the ocean, in order to have\r\navenues for travel open to its people. I am well aware that a more\r\ncommanding, or, perhaps better, a more modern view, would show that\r\nimproved methods of transportation have made the whole world\r\ncommercially one; but invisible tariff walls still separate peoples and\r\nwars break lines of communication.\r\n\r\nIt might be expected that in the New World, conditions being also new\r\nand room for development abundant, civilized nations would have adjusted\r\ntheir boundaries so as to make an ideal subdivision of territory in\r\naccord with natural conditions. A study of the boundaries separating the\r\nnations of North America, however, fails to furnish evidence of such an\r\nadjustment. On the contrary, even between the most highly civilized\r\ncountries, in which the people speak the same language, the dividing\r\nlines are entirely arbitrary, so far as relation to soil, climate,\r\nmineral and timber resources, fisheries, etc., are concerned. The line\r\nseparating Alaska and Canada is mainly a meridian of longitude, which\r\npasses through a rich mining district. The southern boundary of\r\nCanada is for the most part a parallel of latitude dividing\r\nagricultural, mining, and timber lands. The material advancement of the\r\ninhabitants on the opposite sides of these unnatural dividing lines is\r\nretarded by them and the progress of civilization delayed. The same is\r\ntrue of the invisible wall separating the United States from Mexico, and\r\nthe various partitions intersecting Central America. There has evidently\r\nbeen but little, if any, tendency to draw the boundaries referred to in\r\nconformity with natural conditions. What, then, is the force which sets\r\nnature at naught? The reply is not obscure. In one word, it is _greed_.\r\n\"To have and to hold\" is the unwritten motto of republics as well as of\r\nmonarchies.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity of disregarding geographical relations, and in consequence\r\nchecking national development, and leading to stagnation and to material\r\nand intellectual decline, is sadly illustrated by the subdivision of the\r\nWest Indies. In an admirable account of the Caribbean region by R. T.\r\nHill, in which its present commercial depression is described and the\r\nreasons for it judiciously analyzed, occurs the following passage\r\nrelative to the case in point:\r\n\r\n\"A greater drawback to the West Indies than the one-sided\r\nagriculture--the raising of sugar-cane--is their political condition.\r\nTheir distribution among too many nationalities necessitates the support\r\nof expensive and useless administrations, and prevents federation of\r\ninterests and the development of trade among themselves and with the\r\nUnited States, the nearest and largest natural consumer of their\r\nproducts. Very ridiculous some of these political conditions seem. The\r\nisland of St. Martin, not as large as an average county in the United\r\nStates, is divided into two principalities, the French and the Dutch,\r\neach of which maintains an administrative force as large as that of the\r\nState of Texas. Then, as we sail down the eastern islands, hardly a\r\nscore in number, and within sight of one another, aggregating in area\r\nless than our little State of Delaware, about 2,000 square miles, we\r\nfind five foreign and no less than a dozen distinct colonial\r\ngovernments, each responsible to Europe, with no shadow of\r\nfederation between them, or even cooperation of any kind--a condition\r\nnot only pitiable, but absurd. Why should Dominica, whose people are\r\nFrench in language and institutions, be sandwiched in between Martinique\r\nand Guadeloupe, and within easy sight of both, yet so cut off from them\r\nby quarantine and tariff laws that it is commercially nearer England,\r\nsome 3,000 miles distant, than to its neighbours?\"\r\n\r\nThe conditions necessary for an ideal, self-contained government were\r\nbriefly referred to above. In North America, perhaps, several such\r\neligible sites for a definite number of people might be chosen, but in\r\nno case without the drawing of unnatural boundaries. The continent, as\r\nis shown by its geology and geography, is a unit, and the most typical\r\nof comparable size of any on the earth. These same conditions point to a\r\nsingle political unit. Arguing from geographical relations simply, and\r\nnot considering the racial differences and local self-interests, the one\r\nboundary in North America should be the shore boundary, except at the\r\n30-mile-wide Isthmus of Panama. To the geographer North America presents\r\nan example of a region containing within itself essentially all of the\r\nelements necessary to a high industrial, social, educational, and\r\nethical development of its inhabitants. The industrial needs are met by\r\na range of products, whether of soils, mines, forests, or fisheries, as\r\nvaried or nearly so as is presented by the entire earth. Although the\r\ncontinent is broadest at the far north, where climatic extremes prohibit\r\na dense population, yet in the temperate region, or between the mean\r\nannual isotherms of 45 and 75, a space of some 1,200 miles in latitude,\r\nit is from 2,500 to 4,000 miles wide. In this temperate region there is\r\nat present greater commercial and mental activity than elsewhere on the\r\ncontinent, and it is here that the dominant power of the future will be\r\nlocated. Supplementing the agriculture, manufactures, etc., of the\r\ntemperate belt are the vast forested and fur-bearing regions on the\r\nnorth and the exuberant tropical countries on the south. Each of these\r\nthree great regions are parts of a whole and mutually supplement each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the population of North America, in respect to\r\npolitical subdivisions during the year 1900, is indicated, as nearly as\r\nit has been found practicable to ascertain it, in the following table:\r\n\r\n                  POPULATION OF NORTH AMERICA IN 1900\r\n\r\n --------------------------------------------+--------------+-----------\r\n                   Government.               |Area in square|Population.\r\n                                             |    miles.    |\r\n --------------------------------------------+--------------+-----------\r\n            _American Governments_           |              |\r\n                                             |              |\r\n United States (inclusive of Alaska          |    3,626,533 | 76,265,469\r\n     and Porto Rico)[7]                      |              |\r\n Mexico                                      |      767,005 | 13,570,545\r\n Guatemala[8]                                |       63,400 |  1,574,338\r\n Salvador[9]                                 |        7,225 |    803,534\r\n Nicaragua                                   |       49,200 |    420,000\r\n Honduras[10]                                |       45,250 |    407,000\r\n Costa Rica[11]                              |       23,000 |    310,000\r\n Panama (Department of Colombia)             |       32,380 |    290,000\r\n San Domingo[13]                             |       20,596 |  1,244,650\r\n Haiti[13]                                   |        9,242 |    500,000\r\n Cuba                                        |       44,000 |  1,572,797\r\n                                             +--------------+-----------\r\n       Total for American governments        |    4,687,831 | 96,958,333\r\n                                             |              |\r\n   _Possessions still held by                |              |\r\n          European Governments_              |              |\r\n United Kingdom of Great Britain             |              |\r\n      and Ireland:[12]                       |              |\r\n   Canada                                    |    3,653,946 |  4,846,377\r\n   Newfoundland and Labrador                 |       49,734 |    201,934\r\n   Bermuda                                   |           19 |     15,013\r\n   West Indies (Bahamas, Jamaica, etc.)      |       12,059 |  1,357,254\r\n   British Honduras                          |        7,562 |     31,471\r\n                                             +--------------+-----------\r\n       Total for the United Kingdom          |    3,723,320 |  6,452,049\r\n France:                                     |              |\r\n   Miquelon and St. Pierre                   |           93 |      6,250\r\n   West Indies (Guadeloupe,                  |              |\r\n        Martinique, etc.)                    |        1,068 |    354,790\r\n                                             +--------------+-----------\r\n       Total for France                      |        1,161 |    361,040\r\n Denmark:                                    |              |\r\n   West Indies (St. Thomas, St. John,        |              |\r\n        and St. Croix)                       |          149 |     35,900\r\n Holland:                                    |              |\r\n   West Indies (St. Martin in part, St.      |              |\r\n       Eustace, and Saba)                    |           29 |      7,236\r\n                                             +--------------+-----------\r\n        Total for European governments       |    3,724,659 |  6,856,225\r\n                                             +--------------+-----------\r\n        Total for North America              |    8,412,490 |103,814,558\r\n --------------------------------------------+--------------+-----------\r\n\r\n[7] The area of Alaska is 590,884 square miles; its population, 63,592.\r\nThe area of Porto Rico is 3,600 square miles; its population (1899),\r\n953,243.
