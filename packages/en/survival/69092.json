BOWNOCKER\r\n\r\n\r\nAREA.—This field lies in the three counties, Athens, Perry and Morgan.\r\nLeaving out of consideration at present a few small outlying pools, and\r\nstarting at the south, the productive territory may be said to begin in\r\nSection 22, Trimple township, Athens county. From this point it runs\r\nalmost due north to the Perry county line. The widest part of this\r\nportion of the field does not exceed one-half mile, while the narrowest\r\nportion permits of a single row only of wells.\r\n\r\n[A] Published by permission of Edward Orton, Jr., State Geologist.\r\n\r\nIt enters Monroe township, Perry county in Section 33, and runs almost\r\ndue north towards Corning, but bends to the northeast about one mile\r\nsouth of that place. Here the productive territory attains a maximum\r\nwidth of 3 miles, the greatest in the field. The northeast course is\r\ncontinued to the Morgan county line, where it turns due north, skirting\r\nthat line with a productive strip about one-half mile wide for 2½\r\nmiles, when it turns slightly to the east, entering Morgan county in\r\nSection 31 of Deerfield township. From that place it extends through\r\nSection 30 and into Section 19, beyond which it has not been traced.\r\nDevelopment of this part of the field is retarded by floods of salt\r\nwater which may limit it in this direction. The total length of the\r\nfield is about 14 miles.\r\n\r\nOutside of this belt are four pools, two of which are of little\r\nimportance. One lies around Glouster, and has an area of less than one\r\nsquare mile. A second one lies in Sections 22 and 29, a short distance\r\nnorthwest of Glouster. This is the principal territory from which the\r\ngas of Corning and surrounding towns is derived. A third pool lies\r\naround Porterville, and the fourth known as the Oakfield lies from 3 to\r\n5 miles north of Corning. It includes parts of sections 5, 21, 28, 29,\r\n32, and 33 of Pleasant and 22, 27 and 34 of Bearfield townships. It is\r\nin this pool that the most extensive work is being done at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY.—Probably the first deep well drilled in the Sunday Creek\r\nValley was near Burr Oak, about 4 miles south of Corning. Its date is\r\nnot now known, but it must have been 40 or more years ago. Its depth\r\nis likewise unknown, but it is reported to have penetrated the salt\r\nsand. To this day it flows salt water, and with it sufficient gas to be\r\nignited. This well, however, seems not to have aroused suspicion that\r\nthere might be valuable liquids other than salt water buried in the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of oil in the Corning field was a matter of accident,\r\nand resulted directly from a scarcity of water for the Toledo and Ohio\r\nCentral railroad. To remedy this a deep well was drilled in August,\r\n1891, at the round-house, about three-fourths of a mile south of\r\nCorning. The only water found was in the salt sand which is reported as\r\nhaving been struck at a depth of 630 feet. The supply was copious, but\r\nthe salinity prevented its being used in locomotives. This brine was\r\nshut out of the well by casing and the drill forced down to a depth of\r\n1507 feet. Finding no water at that depth the work ceased, but a few\r\ndays later oil was thrown to the top of the derrick, and there were\r\nsmaller eruptions later. However further disturbances of this sort were\r\nprevented by the company closing the well.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT.—The disclosure made by this well attracted the attention\r\nof oil men who immediately entered the field and began leasing\r\nterritory. The citizens of Corning feared the territory was falling\r\ninto the hands of the Standard Oil Company, and that it might not under\r\nsuch conditions be developed for years. Accordingly a home company\r\nstyled “The Sunday Creek Oil & Gas Company,” was organized in\r\nFebruary, 1892, to make certain the development of the territory. The\r\ncapital stock was placed at $10,000 in shares of $50, and $8900 of\r\nthe stock was sold. Much of this was raised by citizens of the town\r\nsubscribing for single shares.\r\n\r\nThe new Company was successful. By January 1st, 1898, 255% in dividends\r\nhad actually been paid the stock holders. In September, 1898, a power\r\nfor pumping the wells, and costing over $7000, was erected, the\r\ncontractor taking the product of the wells until it paid for the plant.\r\nIn November, 1899, the property together with $1250—the amount received\r\nin excess of the cost of the plant—was turned over to the original\r\nholders. The power is now (July 1, 1900,) pumping 20 wells, which have\r\na daily production of 40 barrels.\r\n\r\nThe first well drilled by this Company was on the William Fisher farm\r\nin northwest quarter section 14, Monroe township, Perry county. The\r\nBerea was struck at 1012 feet, but the indications were so unfavorable\r\nfor a paying well that it was not considered advisable to shoot it.\r\nHowever, on June 2d, 1892, after waiting nearly a month, the well was\r\nshot with 80 quarts of nitro-glycerine, which had been hauled from\r\nSistersville, W. Va. The cost of the shot was $200. The first day\r\nfollowing the shooting of the well it produced 12 barrels, and a year\r\nlater was still producing 10 barrels per day. Following this other\r\nwells were drilled in sections 14 and 15. In all 25 have been drilled,\r\nonly 3 of which were dry holes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CORNING OIL _and_ GAS FIELD\r\n\r\nBY J.A. BOWNOCKER.]\r\n\r\nOther companies began work and the territory was rapidly leased and\r\ntested. Naturally operations began near the round-house where oil had\r\nfirst been shown to exist. From this as a center the drill moved out\r\nin all directions until the limits of the field had been disclosed.\r\nThe later work has been along the northeast end of the territory in\r\nMorgan county, where the oil seems to be shut out by reservoirs of\r\nsalt water. During the present summer (1900) the valuable pool in the\r\nOakfield district has been developed, though small wells had been\r\nfound there several years earlier. The principal farms are the Porter,\r\nLongstreth, Donnelly, Monahan, McDonald and Grenen. The first well was\r\non the Porter farm and was finished early in 1900. Its production was\r\n35 barrels the first day. The second well was on the Monahan farm. It\r\nwas completed soon after the Porter well and had an initial flow of 45\r\nbarrels in 24 hours. The next two wells were drilled on the Longstreth\r\nfarm, and both were fair producers. Early in the Spring a well was\r\ncompleted on the Donnelly farm and flowed 125 barrels the first day.\r\nOther wells on this farm are much smaller. Two wells on the Grenen\r\nfarm began flowing 675 and 90 barrels respectively. It is interesting\r\nto note that the development of this, the richest part of the Corning\r\nfield, occurred late in the territory’s history. Possibly other pools\r\nof equal richness may yet be discovered lying near the principal field.\r\n\r\nAn important step in the development of the field occurred on August\r\n13th, 1893 when the Buckeye Pipe Line was completed. Before that the\r\noil was transported by tank cars. The oil which is brought to the tanks\r\npartly by gravity and partly by suction, the latter being produced by\r\nan 8 horse-power gas engine, is stored in two iron tanks, one of which\r\nhas a capacity of 30,000, and the other 28,000 barrels. From these\r\ntanks the oil is forced to Elba, a distance of 34 miles, through a 4\r\ninch line. This work is done by a 35 horse-power engine which gives a\r\npressure in the line of from 700 to 1000 pounds per square inch. The\r\nrate at which the oil is transported varies with the temperature. In\r\nthe summer when the oil is warm, and hence thin, 128 barrels may be\r\npumped in one hour, but in the winter when the oil is cold and thick\r\nthe transportation may be restricted to 11 barrels for the same period.\r\n\r\nWhen the pipe line was completed the production of the field was\r\nabout 500 barrels per day. It increased to 1300 barrels in 1896, but\r\nsince then has declined. At present it ranges from 800 to 900 barrels\r\nper day. The total production of the field is shown by the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Buckeye Pipe Line Company—Macksburg Division.\r\n    Oil City, Pennsylvania, October 25th, 1900.\r\n\r\n    J.

R. CAMPBELL, Treasurer.\r\n\r\nLEASES.—At first the operators paid no bonuses, but gave a royalty\r\nof one-eighth of the oil to the land owners—a rate of compensation\r\nthat has been usually maintained. To this there is one exception\r\nworthy of note. When the round-house well showed the existence of\r\noil, and operators began leasing the surrounding territory, Fredrick\r\nWeaver, a thrifty German farmer residing a short distance east from\r\nthe round-house, quietly visited the oil fields of Washington,\r\nPennsylvania, and investigated the methods of leasing oil territory in\r\nthat field. When he returned home he demanded a royalty of one-fourth\r\nthe oil and a bonus of $200 for each of the eight wells which it was\r\nproposed should be drilled on his farm of eighty acres, and since his\r\nterritory was regarded as very promising, these rather severe terms\r\nwere granted. However, after drilling six wells, and the territory\r\nnot meeting expectations, the contractors complained and Mr. Weaver\r\ngenerously reduced the bonus. More recently a royalty of one-sixth the\r\noil has been received by holders of lands that were deemed especially\r\npromising, and bonuses also have been received. The leases usually\r\nrequired that a well be drilled in from thirty to sixty days, but\r\nsometimes, especially in the least promising territory, six months were\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\nThat the field was a monopoly for no one is shown by the following\r\nlist, which includes the chief operators of the district:\r\n\r\n    Corning Oil Company.\r\n    Denman & Thompson.\r\n    O’Connel Oil Company.\r\n    Brooks Oil Company.\r\n    Caldron & Snyder.\r\n    Sunday Creek Oil & Gas Company.\r\n    Perry County Oil Company.\r\n    W.

The highest hills reach up\r\nto or extend above the Ames or Crinoidal limestone. In fact along the\r\nnortheast extremity of the field the hills are capped by the limestones\r\nwhich underlie the Pittsburgh coal. The deepest valley—that of Sunday\r\nCreek—cuts through the Middle Kittanning coal, a short distance north\r\nof Corning, but at this town the seam named is under cover, while the\r\nUpper Freeport coal is at about drainage level.\r\n\r\nThe succession of strata under ground is shown by the following record\r\nkept and furnished the Survey by Mr. G. W. Delong, Superintendent of\r\nSchools, Corning. The well is located on lot 154 of the town just\r\nnamed, and the top of the well lies at the base of the Mahoning\r\nsandstone:\r\n\r\n                           Thickness of      Total\r\n                             Stratum       Thickness\r\n\r\n    Shale                     25 feet        25 feet\r\n    Bastard Lime              15  “          40  “\r\n    Sand                      10  “          50  “\r\n    Coal (No. 6)              10  “          60  “\r\n    White Slate               65  “         125  “\r\n    Sand                      15  “         140  “\r\n    White Slate               25  “         165  “\r\n    Blue                      10  “         175  “\r\n    Sand                      10  “         185  “\r\n    Slate                     50  “         235  “\r\n    Shale                     35  “         270  “\r\n    Sand                      30  “         300  “\r\n    Black Shale               10  “         310  “\r\n    Lime                      25  “         335  “\r\n    Shale with Concretions   100  “         435  “\r\n    Slate                     25  “         460  “\r\n    Limestone(?)              30  “         490  “\r\n    Shale                     35  “         525  “\r\n    Salt Sand                 30  “         555  “\r\n    White Slate              100  “         655  “\r\n    Slate and Concretions     25  “         680  “\r\n    Shale                     15  “         695  “\r\n    Little Salt Sand          20  “         715  “\r\n    White Slate              100  “         815  “\r\n    Slate and Concretions    100  “         915  “\r\n    Brown Shale               40  “         955  “\r\n    Black Shale               38  “         993  “\r\n    Top Berea                               993  “\r\n    Bottom of Berea                        1008  “\r\n\r\nThe depth of the well as shown by the steel line is 1012½ feet. It\r\nwas drilled in the Fall of 1896, and was shot with twenty quarts of\r\nnitro-glycerine. It began flowing thirty barrels per day, but the\r\nproduction has diminished until at present it is producing only one\r\nbarrel per day. Below the Berea the Bedford shales are found in their\r\nnormal conditions.\r\n\r\nTHE OIL SAND.—This is in all cases the Berea. The sand has the light\r\ngray color so common in this formation in other parts of the state.\r\nIt is moderately fine grained, but there is considerable variation in\r\nthis respect. Usually it is a pure quartz sand, but occasionally has\r\nthin layers of dark shaly material running through it. In thickness\r\nit shows considerable variation, but never disappears in this field.\r\nThe normal thickness is usually given as twenty feet and the maximum\r\nreported is eighty feet. This depth was found on the Potts farm about\r\none and one-fourth miles northeast of Corning, and on the O’Farrell\r\nfarm about two miles east from the same town. In both cases a dark\r\ngray shale, probably the Ohio, lay below. The Bedford on this theory\r\nhad been swept away before the Berea was deposited. In such abnormal\r\ndepths the additions always appear to be on the bottom, showing that\r\nthe surface of the underlying Bedford shale was quite uneven. Here, as\r\nelsewhere in the state, the drill shows the upper surface of the Berea\r\nto be uniform. It is worthy of note that the production of oil does\r\nnot vary as the thickness of the sand. In fact in this field the great\r\nthicknesses are generally poor producers.\r\n\r\nThe “pay streak” or that containing the oil and gas ranges in thickness\r\nfrom 3 to 8 feet, but very few of the wells attain the maximum figure.\r\nTowards the margin of the productive field the “pay streak” thins, and\r\nfinally disappears. The top of the “pay” usually lies from 10 to 15\r\nfeet below the surface of the Berea. As a rule the “pay” is coarser\r\nthan other parts of the Berea, and generally the coarser the rock the\r\nlarger the well. Sometimes in the thick part of the Berea there are two\r\n“pay streaks.”\r\n\r\nTHE WELLS.—The number of wells producing July 1, 1900, exceeded 600.\r\nAbout 100 dry holes have been drilled and about an equal number of\r\nwells have been abandoned, so that 800 is a fair approximation of the\r\ntotal number of wells drilled in the field. As a rule a well has been\r\nput down for each 8 to 10 acres of surface territory.\r\n\r\nThe wells have been cased through the salt sand, a depth of 555 feet in\r\nthe valley at Corning. The casing has almost invariably been 5⅝ inches,\r\ninside measurement. The rocks comprising the underlying 160-180 feet,\r\nand terminating with the “Little Salt Sand” have furnished some water\r\nwhich has been disastrous to the wells. It reduced the gas pressure,\r\nthus necessitating pumping the wells earlier than otherwise would have\r\nbeen required, and perhaps prematurely destroying the life of the well.\r\nHad the wells been cased through the “Little Salt Sand” time and money\r\nwould have been saved, and the production of the field would have been\r\nlarger.\r\n\r\nThe western side of the field is quite free from salt water. It is on\r\nthat side that the principal gas territory lies. On the eastern side of\r\nthe field the conditions are more variable. In Trimble township, Athens\r\ncounty, the wells are free from water, while in Monroe township, Perry\r\ncounty, salt water is found in the northeast corner, and in Morgan\r\ncounty it is so abundant that operating is prevented. From this it\r\nappears that the western side of the Corning field is free from salt\r\nwater, and that it is absent also on the eastern side at the southern\r\nmargin of the territory, but that it increases rapidly to the northeast.\r\n\r\nWhile the production of the wells after being shot has varied greatly,\r\nyet they have not furnished the great extremes that many other fields\r\nhave. Few, if any of the wells, have started better than 125 barrels\r\nper day, and it has been estimated that the average for the entire\r\nfield has been 20 barrels.\r\n\r\nThe wells have sufficient gas pressure to flow them during the earlier\r\npart of their lives, but later as the pressure diminishes they have to\r\nbe pumped. Since the eastern side of the field has salt water the wells\r\nthere have to be pumped earlier than those on the western side.\r\n\r\nTHE GAS WELLS.—The principal gas territory is that along Muddy Fork\r\nin Sections 22 and 29 Trimble township, Athens county, the best wells\r\nbeing found in the western half of the latter section on the lands of\r\nthe Hocking Coal and Railroad company. The largest well in this field\r\nstarted at 3,000,000 cubic feet per day with a rock pressure of 400\r\npounds. It was drilled in the fall of 1897, and one year later was\r\nproducing 2,000,000 cubic feet per day, and still another year later\r\n1,500,000 cubic feet. Of the other wells in this territory two started\r\nat 2,000,000 feet each, two at 1,000,000 feet each, and three at\r\n500,000 feet each. The decline in the smaller wells was not as rapid as\r\nin the larger ones since the demands made on them were not as heavy.\r\nThus far no dry holes have been found in this territory. The reliance\r\nof the community is on this field where 5,000 acres are leased in one\r\nblock.\r\n\r\nAnother district that has yielded considerable gas is that at Oakfield\r\nabout 3 miles north of Corning. These wells started at 2,000,000,\r\n1,500,000, 500,000, and 250,000 cubic feet per day respectively. Two\r\nof the smaller of these have been abandoned after having produced for\r\ntwo years. The largest of these wells, now four years old, is producing\r\n500,000 cubic feet per day, and the second largest, now three years\r\nold, is producing the same amount. The wells in this field produce\r\nconsiderable oil and by some are rated as oil wells rather than gas\r\nones.\r\n\r\nOutside of these two places an occasional strip is found that produces\r\ngas in paying quantities. Thus about one mile northeast of Corning\r\ntwo wells were drilled, which combined produced 500,000 cubic feet\r\nper day. They produced three years and were then abandoned. About two\r\nmiles north of Corning a good well was drilled on the Newberry farm. It\r\nstarted at 1,500,000 cubic feet per day, had an initial rock pressure\r\nof 400 pounds and lasted three years.\r\n\r\nAnother productive tract lies about 6 miles northeast of Corning on\r\nthe Finley, Devore and Stoneburner farms. Three wells were drilled on\r\nthe Finley farm, and started one at 1,500,000 and two at 250,000 cubic\r\nfeet, with an initial rock pressure of 400 pounds. These wells lasted\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\nThe operators of the wells have been much troubled with salt water\r\nin the Muddy Fork field and with oil in the Oakfield territory. Salt\r\nwater is removed by “blowing” the wells. For this operation the wells\r\nare closed for a short period, usually about 30 minutes, allowing the\r\ngas pressure to increase; when this has become sufficiently strong the\r\nwell is opened at the top and the gas then blows the water from the\r\nwell. When the well has been cleansed in this manner it is closed and\r\nthe gas turned back into the mains. Sometimes, however, the weight of\r\nthe water is so great that the gas cannot drive it from the well in\r\nthe manner just stated, especially is this true with wells that have\r\nbeen in use for a considerable period. Then an iron rod attached to a\r\nlong pole is let down through the water, is raised and lowered, and\r\nthe gas following the pole in its ascent finally drives the water from\r\nthe well. This method of cleaning is known as “agitating.” Finally the\r\npressure of the gas becomes so small that it cannot lift the water with\r\nthe help of “agitating,” and then the well is dead. In winter time each\r\nwell is cleaned every other day, and in the summer twice a week.\r\n\r\nThe gas wells in the Corning field are owned and operated by the\r\nCorning Natural Gas Company. It supplies Jacksonville, Trimble,\r\nGlouster, Murray City, New Straitsville, Shawnee, Hemlock, Corning,\r\nRendville, Moxahala, New Lexington, and several interior hamlets.\r\nAlmost the sole use of the fuel is for heat and light.\r\n\r\nThe company makes a rate of 20 cents per thousand feet by meter. Where\r\nthe meter is not used, the prices in winter are $2.00 per month for the\r\nfirst fire; $1.50 for the second; $1.00 for the third; 75 cents for the\r\nfourth, and all additional fires at the latter figure. In the summer a\r\ncharge of $1.50 for each cooking fire is made. For lights the charges\r\nare 25 cents each for the first two and 15 cents for each additional\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe number of customers supplied by this company in 1900 was\r\napproximately as follows:\r\n\r\n    Corning            300\r\n    Glouster           250\r\n    New Lexington      250\r\n    Shawnee            200\r\n    New Straitsville   150\r\n    Other places       350\r\n                      ——\r\n    Total             1500\r\n\r\nIn the Fall of 1899 the wells of the company produced 6,000,000 cubic\r\nfeet per day, but during cold weather when the demand for fuel was\r\ngreat they dropped to 3,000,000 cubic feet, and the rock pressure which\r\nwas 300 pounds in the Fall was only 200 during the winter. On July 7th,\r\n1900, the rock pressure of the wells in the Muddy Fork field ranged\r\nfrom 170 to 280 pounds, indicating a considerable drop from that of the\r\npreceding autumn. The company expects to drill four additional wells\r\nduring the ensuing fall (1900) in the Muddy Fork territory, and by so\r\ndoing expects to keep three wells closed, and thus maintain a good rock\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWELVE ADDITIONS TO THE OHIO PLANT LIST.\r\n\r\nW.

HINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gomphus viridifrons_ n. sp. Length of the abdomen about 33 mm., hind\r\nwing about 27 mm.; black, face and occiput green; prothorax with\r\nanterior margin and three spots green or yellow; thorax green with\r\nspaces at base of wings, lateral suture and six bands before black,\r\nthe two middle bands are abbreviated anteriorly and separated by the\r\nmid-dorsal carina which is very feebly green. Abdomen black, a dorsal\r\nband and sides of first two or three segments yellowish, a yellow spot\r\nat base of each of segments four to seven, and sides of eight and nine\r\nusually yellowish.\r\n\r\nAbdominal appendages of the male straight, about as long as the tenth\r\nsegment, from above, widest at base, gradually narrowed from apical\r\nthird and acute at apex; from the side prominently widened at base,\r\nwith a strong tooth beneath at two-thirds of the length. Hamules large,\r\nof nearly the same width for the whole length and ending behind in a\r\nhooked process. Vulvar scale almost as long as the ninth abdominal\r\nsegment, gradually narrowed, apical third divided and the two parts\r\ndivaricate.\r\n\r\nDescribed from fourteen males and a female taken at Loudonville, Ohio,\r\nJune 14, 1900; and a male and female taken at Ohio Pile, Pa.—the latter\r\ntwo specimens by E. B. Williamson.\r\n\r\nThe species averages larger than either _brevis_ or _abbreviatus_\r\nand may be separated from the former readily by its green face, by\r\nthe striking differences in the vulvar lamina and by the hamules and\r\nmale appendages. In _brevis_ the tooth on the appendage is nearer\r\nthe end and the space from it to appex is noticeably curved while in\r\n_viridifrons_ this space is practically straight.\r\n\r\nIt has more points in common with _abbreviatus_, but in that species\r\nthe vulvar scale is short and triangular, the hamules are smaller and\r\nshorter, and the tooth on the superior appendage of the male is much\r\nfarther from the apex.\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of Dr. Calvert and Mr. Williamson I have at my\r\ndisposal, specimens from which many of the accompanying drawings were\r\nmade. In _viridifrons_, _brevis_ and _abbreviatus_ I have made drawings\r\nfrom different specimens of the same species to show slight variations.\r\n\r\nThis is _Gomphus_ sp. Williamson, Dragonflies of Indiana, 294.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COMPARATIVE STUDY OF GOMPHUS FURCIFER AND VILLOSIPES.\r\n\r\nJAMES S. HINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems that nearly every author who has considered these two species\r\nhas compared them. Considering general appearances they are much alike\r\nbut can be separated easily by several details and as I have good\r\nmaterial of both sexes of the two species before me, I thought it\r\nmight be of consequence to consider in a comparative way some of their\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nThe occiput in both sexes of _villosipes_ bears a prominent tooth at\r\nthe middle of its upper edge. This tooth varies some in different\r\nspecimens, it ends above in a single point or it may be widened and end\r\nabove in three or more points. In _furcifer_ there is no tooth on the\r\nocciput in either sex.\r\n\r\nThe vulvar scales are very different, in _villosipes_ the part may\r\nbe said to be triangular with the free sides curved and the apical\r\npart divided for about half the length of the scale. In _furcifer_\r\nits basal part is similar but the apical part is produced, giving\r\nquite a different form. In the former species the scale is about\r\none-third as long as the ninth segment, while in the latter it is about\r\nthree-eighths as long as that segment.\r\n\r\nThe abdominal appendages of the male are different. From dorsal view\r\nthose of _furcifer_ are rectangular with the inner distal angle very\r\nmuch produced inward and backward; in _villosipes_ they are wide at\r\nbase, oblong, with the outer distal part broadly rounded and the\r\ncorresponding inner part produced directly backward. The hamules are\r\ncharacteristic and may be explained best by reference to the figures.\r\n\r\nThe two species are colored much alike but _furcifer_ is darker.\r\nThe tenth abdominal segment may be said to be yellow in both but in\r\n_furcifer_ the sides of the segment are dark, oftentimes black.\r\n\r\nThey agree in habits, both preferring to fly over stagnant water where\r\nthe males come to rest on floating objects or on the ground at the\r\nwater’s edge. I have observed the female of _furcifer_ ovipositing in\r\nstagnant water among lily pads and other aquatic plants. Her flight is\r\nslow while thus engaged, and her actions more like a _Libellula_ than\r\nthe usual _Gomphus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF PLATE.\r\n\r\n    Gomphus villosipes—1, dorsal view of male\r\n    appendages; 3, vulvar scale; 5, hamule; 7, occiput\r\n    of female; 8, occiput of male.\r\n\r\n    Gomphus furcifer—2, dorsal view of male appendages;\r\n    4, hamule; 6, vulvar scale; 9, occiput of male; 10,\r\n    occiput of female.\r\n\r\n    Gomphus viridifrons—11, 12, 13, dorsal view of\r\n    male appendages—13 from Pa., 11, 12 from Ohio;\r\n    14, 15, 16, hamules; 17, 18, vulvar scales—18 from\r\n    Pennsylvania, 17 from Ohio.\r\n\r\n    Gomphus brevis—19, 20, 21, dorsal view of male\r\n    appendages—specimens from Maine and Pennsylvania;\r\n    22, 23, 24, hamules; 25, 26, vulvar scales.\r\n\r\n    Gomphus abbreviatus—27, 28, 29, hamules; 30, 31,\r\n    vulvar scales; 32, 33, 34, dorsal view of male\r\n    appendages—specimens all from Maine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate 5._\r\n\r\nHINE—GOMPHINE STUDIES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES FROM BOTANICAL LITERATURE.\r\n\r\nW. A. KELLERMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very interesting Bulletin of eight pages on the Chrysanthemum Rust\r\nhas been issued by J. C. Arthur, botanist of the Indiana Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station. It is No. 85, and is dated October, 1900. Dr.\r\nArthur gives a general account of Uredineae or Rusts, explaining\r\nthat the typical forms have three prominent sets of spores, namely\r\n(1) aecidiospores, usually red or orange in little white cups, (2)\r\nuredospores, generally of a rusty yellow color and abundant (hence\r\nthe group name, Rusts), and (3) teleutospores, or the Winter spores,\r\nusually dark brown or black. He further states that only uredospores\r\nhave yet been found in Europe and America, and since the fungus is an\r\nannual, it is puzzling to see how it escapes extermination in winter\r\nand spring when Chrysanthemum plants are latent.\r\n\r\nThe assumption that this was the well known and common Puccinia\r\nhieracii or Puccinia tanaceti he proves to be incorrect by inoculation\r\nexperiments. Uredospores from Chrysanthemums he sowed on Chrysanthemums\r\nand obtained a crop of uredospores. Similar uredospores sowed on\r\nDandelion, Burdock, and Ox-eye Daisy produced no infection; uredospores\r\nfrom the latter hosts sown on Chrysanthemum likewise produced no\r\ninfection. Uredospores from Dandelion sown on Dandelion produced\r\nuredospores. Others have tried similar experiments, using Tansy,\r\nCostmary, Orange Hawkweed, Giant Daisy, and Marguerite, besides the\r\nhost plants named above, but the Chrysanthemum Rust refuses to grow\r\non any of them. This Rust, which is common and well known on the\r\nChrysanthemum in Japan, has been named Puccinia chrysanthemi by Rose.\r\n\r\nIn connection with suggestions relative to combating the disease,\r\nDr. Arthur says that “so long as the teleutospores do not make an\r\nappearance in this country, the careful cultivator may feel assured\r\nthat a moderate amount of timely effort will enable him to rid\r\nhis establishment of the Rust, if he is so unfortunate as to have\r\nit donated to him by some careless florist. Observations made by\r\nthe writer and others show that the tendency is for the disease\r\nto disappear of itself, to run its course in an establishment and\r\ndie out, which is very likely to some extent due to the absence of\r\nteleutospores.”\r\n\r\nBRYOLOGY.—Mrs. Britton’s popular articles on the Mosses and how to\r\nstudy them, that have appeared from time to time, furnished the\r\ndirections and incentive to many who before had taken little or no\r\ninterest in this group of plants. Her purpose and plan are imitated\r\nand extended in a charming little book, that has been prepared and\r\npublished by Dr. A. J. Grout, of the Boys’ High School, Brooklyn, New\r\nYork, called “Mosses with a Hand-Lens.” The author says that many years\r\nof study of Mosses in the field and in Herbaria have convinced him\r\nthat “any person of average intelligence can easily learn to recognize\r\nseventy to one hundred common mosses, with the aid of a hand-lens of\r\nten to fifteen diameters magnifying power.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9, Ceratodon.]\r\n\r\nI have Dr. Grout’s permission to reproduce two illustrations, which\r\nrepresent fairly that phase of his valuable book. Figure 9 shows\r\nCeratodon purpureus L, and the text pertaining to the same is as\r\nfollows: “Ceratodon is one of the commonest of all our mosses. It\r\nis found on the edges of paths, roofs of old buildings, sand by the\r\nseashore, and in general any barren compact soil is its favorite\r\nhabitat. The plants are short and grow close together, forming dense\r\nthin mats of dark green. The lance-like young sporophytes appear early\r\nin spring as soon as the snow is melted. By the middle of summer the\r\ncapsules often decay beyond recognition, and the seta breaks from the\r\nplant at the touch.\r\n\r\nUnless one has become very familiar with Ceratodon it is not always\r\neasy to recognize it without mature capsules. When the capsules have\r\nfully matured they shrink when dry and become furrowed. This peculiar\r\nfurrowing, the dark rich color of the capsules, a color called purple\r\nby the older botanists, but which is really a very dark chestnut or\r\nred-brown, make it easy to recognize this species.”\r\n\r\nPlate II. shows the Hair-cap Mosses, Polytrichum, the largest of all\r\nour species. There are four common species all having square capsules\r\nwhich character distinguishes them from Pogonatums, the latter having\r\ncylindric capsules. “The Ohio Hair-cap without the sporophyte (seta\r\nand capsule, commonly called fruit) is not readily distinguished from\r\nthe Common, as the leaves and general appearance are very similar. But\r\nwith the sporophyte present, the distinctions are clear. In Figs. b and\r\nd (Plate II.) note that the capsule of the Common Hair-cap is almost\r\ncubical, that the lid has a _very short beak_, and that the capsule is\r\nentirely covered by the calyptra. The capsule of the Ohio Hair-cap (e)\r\nis elongated, slender with a tapering neck, and with a much longer beak\r\nto the lid. The lid and the calyptra of the Ohio Hair-cap fall early in\r\nJune, very soon after the spores are ripe, and it is not always easy to\r\nfind either in position, but if the calyptra be found, it will be seen\r\nto cover the upper portion of the capsule only. The Common Hair-cap,\r\nalthough occurring in woods, is most common in open fields; the Ohio\r\nHair-cap being most frequent in shady, more moist spots, often in deep\r\nwoods. The remaining two species are easily distinguished from the\r\ntwo mentioned above by the margins of the leaves, which are thin and\r\nmembranaceous, and are folded in over the central portion of the leaf,\r\nas illustrated in o, o′ and p.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n   Plate II., Polytrichum or Hair-cap Moss.\r\n   Figs. a (dry), b (moist), c (leaf), d (capsule) and f are P. commune;\r\n   Fig. e, capsule of P. ohioense;\r\n   Figs. g, h and p, P. piliferum;\r\n   Figs. o and o′, P. juniperinum.]\r\n\r\nI can not too strongly commend “Mosses with a Hand-Lens” (price $1.10)\r\nprepared with the purpose of giving “by drawings and descriptions the\r\ninformation necessary to enable any one interested to become acquainted\r\nwith the more common mosses with the least possible outlay of time,\r\npatience and money.” The book contains a key to the genera based mainly\r\non structural characters and one mainly on habitat, also many keys\r\nunder the genera; copious illustrations, clear and accurate on almost\r\nevery page of the text and eight full-page plates from drawings by Mary\r\nV. Thayer; and an illustrated glossary of bryological terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEETING OF THE BIOLOGICAL CLUB.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Biological Club met in Zoological lecture room December 3, 1900.\r\nProf. Herbert Osborn presided, twenty-six members present. The\r\nfollowing papers were presented:\r\n\r\n    “Notes on the Saw Brier, and a Rhamnus new to Ohio.”\r\n\r\n    “The Waverly Series of Ohio.”\r\n\r\nIn the first paper Prof. Kellerman spoke of the distribution of the\r\nSaw Brier, _Smilax glauca_, in the southern part of the State, and\r\nexhibited specimens showing its striking variations in form of leaves.\r\n\r\nThe southern buckthorne, _Rhamnus caroliniana_, was observed commonly\r\nin Adams County. It also occurs in Brown County. This is the first\r\nrecord for this species in Ohio. Specimens in fruit were exhibited.\r\n\r\nA hackberry was found unlike any form hitherto reported from\r\nOhio. Specimens are in the hands of Rev. E. J.
