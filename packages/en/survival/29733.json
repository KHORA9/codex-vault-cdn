The original New England \"towns\" were true communities;\r\nthat is, relatively small local groups of people, each group having its\r\nown institutions, like the church and the school, and largely managing\r\nits own affairs. Down through the years the town meeting has persisted,\r\nand even to-day the New England town is to a very large degree a small\r\ndemocracy. It does not, however, manage all its affairs in quite the\r\nsame fashion that it did two hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nWhen the Western tide of settlement set in, people frequently went West\r\nin groups and occasionally whole communities moved, but the general rule\r\nwas settlement by families on \"family size\" farms. The unit of our rural\r\ncivilization, therefore, became the farm family. There were, of course,\r\nneighborhoods, and much neighborhood life. The local schools were really\r\nneighborhood schools. Churches multiplied in number even beyond the need\r\nfor them. When farmers began to associate themselves together as in the\r\nGrange, they recognized the need of a strong local group larger than the\r\nneighborhood. A subordinate Grange for example is a community\r\norganization. Experience gradually demonstrated that if farmers wished\r\nto coöperate they must coöperate in local groups. Strong nation-wide\r\norganizations are clearly of great importance, but they can have little\r\nstrength unless they are made up of active local bodies. Gradually, the\r\ncommunity idea has spread over the country, in some cases springing up\r\nalmost spontaneously, until to-day there is a very widespread belief\r\namong the farmers, as well as among the special students of rural\r\naffairs, that the organization and development of the local rural\r\ncommunities is the main task in conserving our American agriculture and\r\ncountry life. It is interesting to note that what is true in America is\r\nproving also to be true in other countries. In fact, the farm village\r\nlife in Europe and even in such countries as China is taking on new\r\nactivities, and it is being recognized that the improvement of these\r\nsmall units of society is one of the great needs of the age.\r\n\r\nProfessor Sanderson, in this book, has attempted to indicate just what\r\nthe community movement means to the farmers of America. He has brought\r\nto this task rather unusual preparation. In turn, a graduate of an\r\nagricultural college, a scientist of reputation, Director of an\r\nagricultural experiment station, Dean of a college of agriculture, he\r\nhas had a wide, varied and successful experience in various states. He\r\nfinally arrived at the conviction, however, that the most important\r\nfield of work for him lay in dealing with the larger phases of country\r\nlife, and he gave up administrative work for further preparation in the\r\nnew field. In his position as Professor of Rural Organization in the\r\nCollege of Agriculture at Cornell University, he has been unusually\r\nsuccessful, both as investigator and as teacher. He speaks as one who\r\nknows the farmers and not as an outsider, and also as a thorough\r\nstudent.\r\n\r\nThis book therefore is sent out with a good deal of confidence. It deals\r\nwith one of the most important of the rural topics that can be discussed\r\nthese days. It points out fundamental principles and indicates practical\r\nsteps in applying principles.\r\n\r\n  KENYON L. BUTTERFIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\nIn recent years we have heard a great deal about the rural community and\r\nrural community organization. All sorts of organizations dealing with\r\nrural life discuss these topics at their meetings, the agricultural\r\npress and the popular magazines encourage community development, and a\r\nnumber of books have recently appeared dealing with various phases of\r\nrural community life. The community idea is fairly well established as\r\nan essential of rural social organization.\r\n\r\nOne might gain the impression that the community is a new discovery or\r\nsocial invention were he to read only the current discussions. It is,\r\nhowever, a form of social organization as old as agriculture itself, but\r\nwhich was very largely neglected in the settlement of the larger part of\r\nthe United States. This new emphasis on the community is, therefore, but\r\nthe revival in a new form of a very ancient mode of human association.\r\nThe community becomes essential because the conditions of rural life\r\nhave changed and rural people are again being forced to act together in\r\nlocality groups to meet the needs of their common life.\r\n\r\nThe author has attempted to define the rural community and to describe\r\nthe new conditions which are determining its structure and shaping its\r\nfunctions, in the belief that an understanding of the nature of the\r\nrural community should aid those who are seeking to secure a better\r\nsocial adjustment of the countryside. It attempts to relate \"The Farmer\r\nand His Community.\" The problems and methods of community organization\r\nhave been discussed but incidentally, and the book is not designed as a\r\nhandbook for community development. Its chief aim is to establish a\r\npoint of view with regard to the rural community as an essential unit\r\nfor rural social organization through a sociological analysis of the\r\npast history and present tendencies of the various forms of associations\r\nwhich seem necessary for a satisfying rural society. It is hoped that\r\nsuch an analysis presented in an untechnical manner may be of service to\r\nrural leaders who are working for the development of country life by\r\ngiving them a better understanding of the nature of the community and\r\ntherefore a firmer faith in its future and greater enthusiasm and\r\nloyalty in its service.\r\n\r\nThe present volume is a brief summary of a more extended study of the\r\nrural community, not only in this country but in other lands and in\r\nother times, which is now in preparation for publication.\r\n\r\n  DWIGHT SANDERSON.\r\n\r\nCORNELL UNIVERSITY. _May, 1922._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                                      PAGE\r\n\r\n      I.

The building of real, local farm communities\r\nis perhaps the main task in erecting an adequate rural civilization.\r\nHere is the real goal of all rural effort, the inner kernel of a sane\r\ncountry-life movement, the moving slogan of the new campaign for rural\r\nprogress that must be waged by the present generation._\"--_Kenyon L.\r\nButterfield, in \"The Farmer and the New Day.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE RURAL COMMUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nNo phase of the social progress of the Twentieth Century is more\r\nsignificant or promises a more far-reaching influence than the\r\nrediscovery of the _community_ as a fundamental social unit, and the\r\nbeginnings of community consciousness throughout the United States. I\r\nsay the \"rediscovery\" of the community, for ever since men forsook\r\nhunting and grazing as the chief means of subsistence and settled down\r\nto a permanent agriculture they have lived in communities.\r\n\r\nIn ancient and medieval Europe, in China and India, and among primitive\r\nagricultural peoples throughout the world, the village community is\r\nrecognized as the primary local unit of society. In medieval France the\r\nrural \"_communaute_\" was the local unit of government and social\r\nadministration. Its people met from time to time at the village church\r\nin regular assemblies at which they elected their local officers,\r\napproved their accounts, arranged for the support of the church, the\r\nschool, and local improvements. In most of France and throughout much of\r\nEurope the farm homes are still clustered in villages, from which the\r\nfarm lands radiate. There the village is primarily a place of residence,\r\nand with the lands belonging to it forms the community.\r\n\r\nNew England was settled in much the same manner, being divided into\r\ntowns which still form the local units of government, and which for the\r\nmost part are single communities, though here and there more than one\r\ncenter has sprung up within a town and secondary communities have\r\ndeveloped. The New England town meeting has ever been lauded as the\r\nbirthplace of representative democratic government in America, and in\r\nits original form it was a true community meeting, dealing not only with\r\nthe political government, but considering all religious, educational,\r\nand social matters affecting the common life of the town.\r\n\r\nAlthough the New England tradition determined the form of local\r\ngovernment in the areas settled by its people in the central and western\r\nstates, the township was but an artificial town resulting from methods\r\nof the land surveys. The homesteader \"took up\" his land with but little\r\nthought of community relations. He traded at the nearest town; church\r\nwas first held in the school-house and later churches were erected in\r\nthe open country at convenient points; his children went to the district\r\nschool; and his social life was chiefly in the neighboring homes. His\r\nlife centered in the immediate neighborhood. As railroads covered the\r\ncountry, villages and town sprang up at frequent intervals, and\r\ngradually became the real centers of community life, but usually there\r\nwas but little realization on the part of either village or farm people\r\nof their community interests. The farmer's attention was on the farm,\r\nthe townsman's chief interest was his business, and not infrequently\r\ntheir interests were in conflict and they gave little thought to their\r\nreal dependence on each other.\r\n\r\nIn the South the plantation system of the landed aristocracy, which as\r\nlong as it existed was quite self-sufficient, gave little encouragement\r\nto community development. The county was the most important unit of\r\nlocal government and the \"carpet-baggers'\" efforts at establishing local\r\ntownships were repudiated with the ending of their régime. Only in\r\nrecent years have conditions throughout the South, largely the result of\r\nincreased immigration and the breaking up of large plantations, favored\r\nthe development of local communities.\r\n\r\nIn general, the American farmer has voted and taken his share in local\r\npolitics and government, has attended his own church, has traded where\r\nmost convenient or advantageous, has joined the nearest grange or lodge,\r\nand with his family has visited nearby friends and relatives and joined\r\nwith them in social festivities; he has loyally supported these various\r\ninterests, but until very recently, he has had little conception of the\r\ninterrelations of these institutions in the life of the community or of\r\nthe possible advantages of community development as such. But new wants\r\nand new problems have arisen which may only be met by the united action\r\nof all elements of both village and countryside. The automobile demands\r\nbetter roads and both farmer and businessman are interested to have them\r\nbuilt so that the natural community centers may be most easily reached.\r\nBetter schools, libraries, facilities for recreation and social life,\r\norganization for the improvement of agriculture and for the better\r\nmarketing of farm products, are all community problems and force\r\nattention upon the community area to be served by these institutions. A\r\nconsolidated school or a library cannot be maintained at every\r\ncrossroads. Only by the support of all the people within a reasonable\r\ndistance of a common center are better rural institutions possible.\r\n\r\nThe trend of events was thus bringing about a recognition of the place\r\nof the community in the life of rural people, when the Great War\r\nhastened this process by many years. Liberty Loan, Red Cross, and other\r\nwar \"drives\" were organized by communities which vied with each other in\r\nraising their quotas. A new sense of the unity of the community was\r\nbrought about by the common loyalty to its boys in the nation's service.\r\nHaving created state and county councils of defense, national leaders\r\ncame to appreciate that the primary unit for effective organization for\r\nwar purposes must be the community, and President Wilson wrote to the\r\nState Councils of Defense urging the organization of community councils.\r\nThousands of these had been organized when the Armistice was declared,\r\nand although most of them were not continued, the importance of the\r\nlocal community was given national recognition and attention was\r\ndirected to the need of the better organization of local forces for\r\ncommunity progress.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the rural community? Is it a real entity or is it merely\r\nan idea or an ideal? Where is it and how can we recognize it?\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Professor C. J. Galpin, now in charge of the Farm\r\nLife Studies of the United States Department of Agriculture, for first\r\ndeveloping a method for the location of the rural community. Professor\r\nGalpin[1] holds that the trading area tributary to any village is\r\nusually the chief factor in determining the community area. He\r\ndetermines the community area by starting from a business center and\r\nmarking on a map those farm homes which trade mostly at that center. By\r\ndrawing a line connecting those farm homes farthest from the center on\r\nall the roads radiating from it, the boundary of the trade area is\r\ndescribed. In the same way the areas tributary to the church, the\r\nschool, the bank, the milk station, the grange, etc., may be determined\r\nand mapped. The boundaries of these areas will be found to be by no\r\nmeans coincident, but it will usually be found that most of them center\r\nin one village or hamlet, and that the trade area is the most\r\nsignificant in determining the area tributary to this center. When the\r\nareas served by the chief institutions of adjacent centers are mapped,\r\nit is usually found that a composite line of the different boundary\r\nlines separating these centers will approximate the boundaries of the\r\ncommunities. A line which divides adjacent community areas so that most\r\nof the families either side of this line go most frequently to, or their\r\nchief interests are at, the center within that boundary, will be the\r\nboundary between the adjacent communities. Thus, from the standpoint of\r\nlocation, _a community is the local area tributary to the center of the\r\ncommon interests of its people._[2]\r\n\r\nAs indicated above the business center may usually be taken as the base\r\npoint or community center, from which to determine the boundaries of the\r\ncommunity. However, in the older parts of the country or in hilly or\r\nmountainous regions, the trade or business center is not always the same\r\nas the center of the chief social activities of the people, and may not\r\nbe the chief factor in determining the community center. Not\r\ninfrequently a church, school and grange hall located close together may\r\nform the nucleus of a community which does its business at a railroad\r\nstation village some distance away, possibly over a range of hills. The\r\nchief trading points cannot, therefore, be arbitrarily assumed as the\r\nbase points for determining community areas, but those points at which\r\nthe more important of the common interests of the people find expression\r\nshould be considered as community centers. It is not simply a question\r\nof where the people go most often, but of where their chief interests\r\nfocus.\r\n\r\nWith this concept of a community it is obvious that the \"center\" of a\r\ncommunity must be the base point for determining its area. It would seem\r\nthat the community center is essential to the individuality of any\r\ncommunity: The community \"center\" need not necessarily be at the\r\ngeographical center of the community; indeed in many cases it is at or\r\nclose to one of its boundaries, though in an open level country it will\r\ntend to approximate the center.\r\n\r\nThe term \"community center\" is here used in a literal sense of being the\r\ncenter of the activities of the community. It should be distinguished\r\nfrom the \"community-center idea\" which refers to a building, whether it\r\nbe a community house, school, church, or grange hall, as a \"community\r\ncenter.\" Such a building in which the activities of the community are\r\nlargely centered may be a community center in a very real sense, but in\r\nmost cases these activities will be divided between church, school,\r\ngrange hall, etc. No one of them can then be a center for the whole\r\ncommunity, but taken together they constitute the center in which the\r\nchief interests of the community focus. Every community must necessarily\r\nhave a more or less well defined community center; it may or may not\r\nhave some one building in which the chief activities of the community\r\nhave their headquarters. Such buildings, of whatever nature, may well be\r\ncalled community houses or social centers.\r\n\r\nAlthough attention has been directed to the area of the community, the\r\ncommunity consists not of land or houses but of the people of this area.\r\nIts boundary merely gives a community identity, as does the roll of a\r\ncompany or the charter of a city. The community consists of the people\r\nwithin a local area; the land they occupy is but the physical basis of\r\nthe community. The nature of the community will depend very largely upon\r\nwhether its people live close together or at a distance. In the Rocky\r\nMountain States many communities are but sparsely settled and may have a\r\nradius of forty or fifty miles and yet be true communities, while on the\r\nAtlantic seaboard a definite community with as many people may have a\r\nradius of not over a mile or two.\r\n\r\nNor is the community a mere aggregation or association of the people of\r\na given area. It is rather a corporate state of mind of those living in\r\na local area, giving rise to their collective behavior. There cannot be\r\na true community unless the people think and act together.\r\n\r\nThe term \"neighborhood\" is very frequently used as synonymous with\r\n\"community,\" and should be definitely distinguished. In the sense in\r\nwhich these terms are now coming to be technically employed, the\r\nneighborhood consists of but a group of houses fairly near each other.\r\nFrequently a neighborhood grew up around some one center, as a school,\r\nstore, church, mill, or blacksmith shop, which in the course of time may\r\nhave been abandoned, but the homes remained clustered together. Or the\r\nneighborhood may be merely six to a dozen homes near together on the\r\nsame road or near a corner. The school district of the one-room country\r\nschool is commonly a neighborhood, but as there are no other interests\r\nwhich bind the people together it cannot be considered a community.\r\nLikewise people associate in churches, granges, etc., but church\r\nparishes overlap, and the constituency of any one of these associations\r\nis not necessarily a community. Only when several of the chief human\r\ninterests find satisfaction in the organizations and institutions which\r\nserve a fairly definite common local area tributary to them, do we have\r\na true community. In many cases the neighborhood, particularly the\r\nschool district, forms a desirable unit for certain purposes of social\r\norganization, and, indeed, in many cases it may be necessary to develop\r\nthe neighborhood as a social unit before its people will actively\r\nassociate themselves in community activities, but the neighborhood\r\ncannot function in the same way as the larger community which brings\r\npeople together in several of their chief interests. The community can\r\nsupport institutions impossible in the neighborhood, such as a grange,\r\nlodge, library, various stores, etc. The community is more or less\r\nself-sufficing. A community may include a variable number of\r\nneighborhoods. The community is the smallest geographical unit of\r\norganized association of the chief human activities.\r\n\r\nBringing together these various considerations concerning the nature of\r\nthe rural community we may say that _a rural community consists of the\r\npeople in a local area tributary to the center of their common\r\ninterests_.\r\n\r\nObviously the community thus defined has nothing to do with political\r\nareas or boundaries, for very commonly a community may lie in two or\r\nthree townships or counties. That rural areas are actually divided into\r\nsuch communities and that the community is the primary unit of their\r\nsocial organization may best be tested by taking any given county or\r\ntownship and attempting to map its area into communities on the basis\r\nabove described. In most of the northern and western states and\r\nthroughout much of the South, most of the territory may be quite readily\r\ndivided into communities. This has been demonstrated by the rural\r\nsurveys of the Interchurch World Movement[3] and by the community maps\r\nmade by County Farm Bureaus.\r\n\r\nA very large part of the South, however, has no natural community\r\ncenters and in such sections it will be found very difficult if not\r\nimpossible to define community areas. The store may be at the railroad\r\nstation, the church in the open country, and the district or\r\nconsolidated school at still another point. Some people go to one store\r\nor church and others to another. Under such conditions, no real\r\ncommunity exists. Usually, any form of social organization is more or\r\nless difficult under such conditions, for the people are divided into\r\ndifferent groups for different purposes and there is nothing which makes\r\nunited activities possible. It seems probable that only to the extent\r\nthat certain centers of social and economic life come to be recognized\r\nby the people, and community life is developed around them, will the\r\nmost effective and satisfying social organization be possible.\r\n\r\nRecognition of the community as the primary unit for purposes of rural\r\norganization has now become quite general. Several mid-western states\r\nhave passed legislation permitting school districts to combine into\r\ncommunity districts for the support of consolidated schools or high\r\nschools, irrespective of township or county boundaries. The present\r\ntendency in the centralization of rural schools seems to be in the\r\ndirection of locating them at the natural community centers. Rural\r\nchurches are coming into a new sense of responsibility to the community\r\nand the community church is increasingly advocated. The American Red\r\nCross in planning its peace-time program is recognizing the importance\r\nof the rural community as the local unit for its work. The County Farm\r\nBureaus, working in coöperation with the state colleges of agriculture\r\nand the United States Department of Agriculture, very soon discovered\r\nthe value of the community as the local unit of their organization, and\r\ncarry on their work through community committees or community clubs.\r\nPossibly no other one movement has done so much to bring about the\r\ndefinite location of rural communities and their appreciation by rural\r\npeople. A conference of national organizations engaged in social work in\r\nrural communities held in 1919 summed up the experience of a group of\r\nrepresentative rural leaders in the statement: \"In rural organization it\r\nis recognized that the local community constitutes the functional unit\r\nand the county or district the supervisory unit.\" In other words, it is\r\nthe rural community which really \"carries on,\" whatever the executive\r\norganization of the county or district may be.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the rural community as a social group lies in two facts.\r\nFirst, it is not so large but that most of its people know each other.\r\nThe size of the community in this regard does not depend so much upon\r\nthe actual number of square miles involved as upon the number of its\r\npopulation. People may all be acquainted in a sparsely settled community\r\ncovering a ten-mile radius, and there may be less acquaintance in a\r\nsmall community with a dense population. Secondly, the great majority of\r\nthe people in the average rural community are dependent upon agriculture\r\nfor their income, either directly or once-removed. These two facts make\r\npossible common interests and a social control through public opinion\r\nwhich is not possible in larger social units such as the county or city.\r\nSir Horace Plunkett appreciates this when he says:\r\n\r\n      \"Our ancient Irish records show little clans with a common\r\n      ownership of land hardly larger than a parish, but with all\r\n      the patriotic feeling of larger nations held with an\r\n      intensity rare in modern states. The history of these clans\r\n      and of very small nations like the ancient Greek states\r\n      shows that the _social feeling assumes its most binding and\r\n      powerful character where the community is large enough to\r\n      allow free play to the various interests of human life, but\r\n      is not so large that it becomes an abstraction to the\r\n      imagination_.\"[4]\r\n\r\nThis inherent social strength of the rural community, the fact that the\r\ncommunity is relatively permanent, and the appreciation that only\r\nthrough community effort may rural people realize their natural desire\r\nto enjoy some of the advantages of cities, force the conviction that the\r\ncommunity must be the primary unit for the organization of rural\r\nprogress. It is from this point of view that we shall discuss the\r\ncommunity aspects of the various human interests of the farmer and the\r\nconsequent relations of \"The Farmer and His Community.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Galpin, C.

In\r\nthe \"age of homespun\" the pioneer subdued his new lands and built his\r\nhome; the farm and the home were his and for them he lived. He bought\r\nbut little and had but little to sell. Farms were largely\r\nself-supporting. Neighbors helped each other in numerous ways and as the\r\ncountry became more thickly settled neighborhood life grew apace. But\r\nthere was little sense of relation to the larger community. Roads were\r\nbad and people were too widely scattered to come together except on\r\nspecial occasions. The family was the fundamental social unit and social\r\nlife revolved around the family, or in the immediate neighborhood.\r\n\r\nBut \"times have changed.\" The farm is no longer largely self-supporting.\r\nIt is now but a primary unit in a world-wide economic system, conducted\r\nwith money as the basis of exchange and dominated by the interests of\r\ncapital. Farm products are sold for cash and their value is determined\r\nby distant or world markets with which the farmer has no personal\r\ncontact and of which he often has but little knowledge. Most of the\r\ngoods consumed on the farm must be purchased. The marketing of his\r\nproducts and the purchasing of goods have given the farmer increasing\r\ncontacts with the village and town centers and a broader knowledge of\r\nthe world at large.\r\n\r\nDuring the past century modern ideas of transportation and the\r\ndevelopment of industries due to inventions and scientific discoveries\r\nhave resulted in an enormous growth of city populations. The social life\r\nof the cities is increasingly dominated by the interests of the\r\nindividual rather than those of the family, until the breaking down of\r\nurban family life has become a world-wide problem. The family is no\r\nlonger the social unit of the city as it is in the country.\r\n\r\nNow farm people are by no means as isolated from town and city as is\r\noften imagined. Their brothers and sisters, sons and daughters have gone\r\nto make up the increasing urban populations. Through correspondence and\r\nvisiting back and forth, through frequent trips to town, through the\r\ndaily city newspapers, and through the general reading of magazines,\r\nfarm people are in more or less close contact with the life and manners\r\nof the cities. Inasmuch as slightly over half of our people now live in\r\ntowns or cities and only one-third live on farms, it is not surprising\r\nthat urban ideals and values and the urban point of view tend more and\r\nmore to dominate those of the countryside. There has been a natural\r\ntendency, therefore, for the association of country people to center in\r\nthe country town and village, in the community center.\r\n\r\nBetter transportation and the inability to maintain satisfactory\r\ninstitutions in the open country have made this process inevitable and\r\nit will do much to abolish the evils of rural isolation. The increasing\r\ndifficulty of maintaining successful churches in the open country and\r\nthe growth of the village church, the dissatisfaction with the one-room\r\ndistrict school and the desire for consolidated schools and community\r\nhigh schools, are evidences of this tendency.\r\n\r\nThe smaller size of the farm family has made it less self-sufficient\r\nsocially than formerly, and the fact that fewer near relations live\r\nnearby and farms change hands more often has resulted in fewer\r\nneighborhood gatherings. The different members of the family tend to get\r\ntogether more with groups of their own age and sex coming from all parts\r\nof the community, and definite effort is made for the organization of\r\nsuch groups according to their various interests.\r\n\r\nAttention is directed to these tendencies because in our present\r\nemphasis on the relation of the farmer to his community and on community\r\nvalues, we must not lose sight of the fact that the family must ever be\r\nrecognized as the primary social institution of rural life. Indeed, it\r\nmay not be too much to claim that the largest value in the agricultural\r\nindustry is in the possibility of the most satisfactory type of home\r\nlife. The millionaire farmer is so rare as to be negligible, and\r\nalthough farmers as a class doubtless have as wholesome and satisfactory\r\na living as they would in other pursuits, yet no one engages in farming\r\nas a means of easily acquiring large wealth. The highest rural values\r\ncannot be bought or sold.\r\n\r\nThe mere fact that farming is practically the only remaining industry\r\nconducted on a family basis--which seems likely to continue--and that\r\nall members of the family have more or less of a share in the conduct\r\nand success of the farm, creates a family bond which does not ordinarily\r\nexist where the business or employment of the father and of other\r\nmembers of the family is dissociated from the home. Although the burden\r\nof the farm business on the home is often decried and there is obvious\r\nneed of lightening the mother's work for the farm as much as possible,\r\nyet under the best of conditions there is on the farm a constant and\r\nintimate contact between the father and mother and children which is\r\nrarely found under other conditions.\r\n\r\nPrimitive woman discovered the art of agriculture. At first, the men\r\nassisted the women in what time they could spare from hunting; but as\r\ngame became scarce and the food supply grown from the soil was found to\r\nbe more certain, agriculture became man's vocation. Permanent home life\r\ncommenced with the development of agriculture. As he became a farmer,\r\nprimitive man stayed at home with his wife and shared with her the\r\nnurture of the children. Before then the family had been _hers_, now it\r\nwas _theirs_. The mere fact that the home and the business are both on\r\nthe farm, that father is in the house several times a day and that the\r\nwhole family are acquainted with his farm operations, will always give\r\nthe farm home a superior solidarity, so long as the family lives on the\r\nfarm. Though but few farm homes are ideal and some of them have but\r\nlittle that is attractive, yet nowhere are conditions so favorable for\r\nthe enjoyment of all that is most precious in family life as in the\r\nbetter American farm homes.\r\n\r\nIf this be true, that the chief value in agriculture is in the\r\npossibility of the most satisfactory home life, then community\r\ndevelopment should be considered primarily from the standpoint of its\r\neffect on the farm home, for the social strength of the country will be\r\nmore largely determined by its homes than by its other social\r\ninstitutions. We should endeavor, therefore, to build up that type of\r\ncommunity life which makes for better homes and stronger families. While\r\nseeking to afford superior advantages to individuals, all effort toward\r\ncommunity improvement should recognize that the strength of the\r\ncommunity is in its home life.\r\n\r\nThe need of this point of view with regard to rural community\r\norganization has been very forcibly indicated by Mr. John R. Boardman,\r\none of our keenest observers and interpreters of country life in his\r\n\"Community Leadership.\" He says:\r\n\r\n      \"At the heart of the rural situation is the rural family.\r\n      The social problems involved in home life in the rural\r\n      village and on the farm are of two kinds,--developmental and\r\n      protective. The social unit in the city is the individual.\r\n      Urban conditions have rapidly disintegrated the family as a\r\n      social unit. Grave dangers have resulted from this\r\n      interference with the unity of domestic life. The rural\r\n      family is in danger of meeting the same fate. It is now the\r\n      social unit in the rural social structure. Every effort must\r\n      be put forth to make this situation permanent. The major\r\n      problem is one of home conservation. Protection of the rural\r\n      family against social exploitation will demand increasing\r\n      attention. The development of social organization along\r\n      lines which interfere with the unity and solidarity of rural\r\n      family life must be approached with extreme caution and\r\n      tolerated only as they may be absolutely necessary. So far\r\n      as possible social organization must be built around the\r\n      rural family and give it every possible opportunity to act\r\n      as a family in the scheme of organization and activity. The\r\n      home as a social center must receive increased attention.\r\n      There is great danger, in the new interest which is being\r\n      aroused in rural social life, that the matter of social\r\n      organization be greatly overdone. The rural family will be\r\n      the one to suffer first and most severely as a result of\r\n      this craze for social organization.\"\r\n\r\nIn support of this point of view it is interesting to note that the\r\nstrongest rural institutions, the church, the grange, and the recently\r\norganized Farm Bureaus, are all organizations which have an interest for\r\nthe whole family or for most of its members. With an increasing sense of\r\nsocial needs and responsibilities on the part of rural people, new\r\norganizations will be formed and various community activities must be\r\nundertaken, but if country people will remain true to their traditions\r\nand, with clear view of changing conditions, will seek to organize their\r\ncommunity life as an association of farm and village _families_, they\r\nwill create the most satisfying and enduring type of society. The\r\ncommunity buildings now becoming so popular in rural communities are a\r\ngood example of a family institution organized to furnish better\r\nrecreation and social facilities for the whole family.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the home is its primary social institution, the rural\r\ncommunity must give its first consideration to its relations to the home\r\nand how the home life may be strengthened, if the rural family is to\r\nwithstand the influence of the disintegrating home life of the city. For\r\nthe farm home is in a process of readjustment to modern conditions and\r\nthe recognition of ideals and objectives of home-life by the community\r\nwill be a powerful factor in their maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe mother has ever occupied the central position in the home. Under\r\nmodern conditions, as a result of her education and broader knowledge of\r\nlife, through her more frequent contacts with town and city and through\r\nher wider reading, many a farm mother is coming to feel that her\r\nposition is an anomalous one. In some cases she may be able to solve her\r\nown problems, but only a general change in public opinion concerning\r\ntheir position will bring a more acceptable status to farm women as a\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nSome of the farm woman's problems arise from the increasing division of\r\nlabor between her husband and herself and from the marketing of the farm\r\nproducts; these are the problems of her economic status. The peasant\r\nwoman of medieval Europe or the wife of the American pioneer never\r\nworried that she did not receive a monthly allowance or a certain share\r\nof the farm income. She worked with her husband and family in raising\r\nthe farm products and she shared in their consumption, for but\r\nrelatively little was sold off the place. To-day, the wife of the farm\r\nowner does little work on the farm; its products are sold and much of\r\nthe food and practically all of the clothing is purchased. She and her\r\nchildren contribute a considerable amount of the labor of the farm\r\nenterprise, and do all of the housework; but the husband does the\r\nselling and most of the buying, she often has but little share in the\r\nmanagement of the family's finances, and rarely knows what she may count\r\non for household expenses. She comes to feel that she is no longer a\r\nreal partner, but a sort of housekeeper, though without salary or\r\nassured income. In over nine thousand farm homes studied in the northern\r\nand western states,[5] one-fourth of the women helped with the\r\nlivestock, and one-fourth worked in the field an equivalent of 6.7 weeks\r\na year, over half of them cared for the home gardens, and one-third of\r\nthem kept the farm accounts. Over a third of them helped to milk,\r\ntwo-thirds washed the separators, and 88 percent washed the milk pails,\r\n60 percent made the butter and one-third sold the butter, but only 11\r\npercent had the spending of the money from its sale. Likewise 81 percent\r\ncared for the poultry, but only 22 percent had the poultry money for\r\ntheir own use and but 16 percent had the egg money. These figures do not\r\ngive us a complete analysis of the household finances in relation to the\r\namount contributed by farm women, but they are indicative of the general\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nIt is because of these facts that farm women feel that a larger portion\r\nof the farm income should be spent in giving them better household\r\nconveniences, somewhat commensurate with the amount that is spent for\r\nimproved farm machinery and barn conveniences. Only one-third of these\r\nfarm homes had running water; and but one-fifth had a bath-tub with\r\nwater and sewer connections; 85 percent had outdoor toilets. Improvement\r\nis in evidence, however, for two-thirds had water in the kitchen, 60\r\npercent had sink and drain, 57 percent had washing machines, and 95\r\npercent had sewing machines. It is not that she is merely seeking less\r\nwork so that she may attend her club or go to the movies, that the farm\r\nmother desires better conveniences and shorter hours--her average\r\nworking day is now 11.3 hours--but because she has new ideals of the\r\nnurture which she wishes to give her family and of what she might do for\r\nthem had she the time and physical strength.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the coöperative survey of 10,000 representative farm\r\nhomes in 241 counties in the 33 northern and western states made by home\r\ndemonstration agents and farm women, Miss Ward[6] gives some interesting\r\n\"side-lights,\" which are as illuminating as the statistics:\r\n\r\n      \"Women realize that no amount of scientific arrangement or\r\n      labor-saving appliances will of themselves make a home. It\r\n      is the woman's personal presence, influence, and care that\r\n      make the home. Housekeeping is a business as practical as\r\n      farming and with no romance in it; home making is a sacred\r\n      trust. A woman wants time salvaged from housekeeping to\r\n      create the right home atmosphere for her children and to so\r\n      enrich their home surroundings that they may gain their\r\n      ideals of beauty and their tastes for books and music not\r\n      from the shop windows, the movies, the billboards, or the\r\n      jazz band, but from the home environment.\r\n\r\n      \"The farm woman knows that there is no one who can take her\r\n      place as teacher and companion of her children during their\r\n      early impressionable years and she craves more time for\r\n      their care. She feels the need of making the farm home an\r\n      inviting place for the young people of the family and their\r\n      friends and of promoting the recreational and educational\r\n      advantages of the neighborhood in order to cope with the\r\n      various forms of city allurements. She realizes that modern\r\n      conditions call for an even deeper realization and closer\r\n      contact between mother and child. The familiar term, 'God\r\n      could not be everywhere so He made mothers' has its modern\r\n      scientific application, as no amount of education and care\r\n      given to children in school or elsewhere outside the home\r\n      can take the place of mothering in the home. 'The home\r\n      exists for the child, hence the child's development should\r\n      have first consideration.'\r\n\r\n      \"Farm women want to broaden their outlook and keep with the\r\n      advancement of their children 'not by courses of study but\r\n      by bringing progressive ideas, methods, and facilities into\r\n      the every day work and recreation of the home environment.'\"\r\n\r\n\"True enough,\" you say, \"but these are problems of the individual home.\r\nWhat have they to do with the community?\" Just this: The status of the\r\nfarm woman is a matter determined more by custom than by individual\r\nachievement. It is difficult for any one woman, no matter how able or\r\nstrong-minded, to maintain a status much in advance of that of her\r\nneighbors; but let the women of a community get together and discuss\r\ntheir problems and ideals and the group spirit strengthens each of them\r\nin the pursuit of the common ideals. It is such a desire for mutual\r\nsupport--even though they are not conscious of it--which has drawn farm\r\nwomen together into clubs and which has given such an impetus to the\r\nHome Bureaus, or women's departments of the county Farm Bureaus. Not\r\nonly in women's organizations, but finally in community organizations of\r\nmen and women, such as the Grange and the church, the social standards\r\nof the community receive the sanction of public opinion, than which\r\nthere is no more powerful means of influencing family usages. The\r\ncommunity as such, must give recognition to a new and better status of\r\nits farm women.\r\n\r\nIf the rural home remains the primary social institution, it will be due\r\nto its intelligent effort at self-defense, and not to any inherent right\r\nwhich it has to such a position. Originally the family was but a\r\nbiological group. Until modern times the agricultural family was chiefly\r\nan economic unit. Only with the isolation of the American farm, did the\r\nindividual family assume the primary social position known to our\r\nfathers and grandfathers. Physical isolation and large families made the\r\nfarm home the only possible social center. Isolation is largely passing,\r\nfamilies are smaller, and organizations of all sorts and commercial\r\namusements compete with the family. It is the use of leisure time which\r\nreveals the true loyalty of the family group. If there be nothing to\r\nattract them to the fireside, they will inevitably go elsewhere whenever\r\npossible. Hence, if it would have its foundations strong, the community\r\nmust encourage the enrichment of home life, particularly, in the hours\r\nof leisure when life is most real. The family games after supper, the\r\ngroup around the piano singing old and modern songs, the reading aloud\r\nby one member of the circle, the cracking of nuts and the popping of\r\ncorn, the picnic supper on the lawn, the tennis court or croquet ground,\r\nthe home parties, the guests ever-welcome at meals, these are but items\r\nin a possible scorecard of the sociability of the home. We are giving\r\nmuch thought to all sorts of group activities, but how much attention\r\nhave we given to systematically encouraging the social unit which has\r\nthe largest possibilities, the family? Last summer my friend, Professor\r\nE. C. Lindeman, of the North Carolina College for Women, spent several\r\nweeks in becoming acquainted with rural Denmark under peculiarly\r\nfavorable conditions. A statement in a letter from him regarding Danish\r\nhome life is apropos in this connection:\r\n\r\n      \"I observed that the country people find a great deal of\r\n      social expression within their own homes. The home life is\r\n      organized on a much higher plane than is common in America.\r\n      In addition, there is a larger content of cultural and\r\n      educational material within the family circle.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same way the economic position, health, education, and all other\r\nphases of life of the family are the most potent influences both in the\r\nlife of its members and of the community.\r\n\r\nThe question arises, therefore, what is the community doing to\r\nstrengthen the home? In recent years the new discipline of Home\r\nEconomics has vigorously attacked the problems of diet, clothing, and\r\nhousehold management, and has accomplished much. It is now concerning\r\nitself with health, child welfare, and even with child psychology and\r\nthe family as an institution. Yet the home economics point of view is\r\nnecessarily restricted to that of the institution which it serves, i.e.,\r\nthe home; it has the same limitations, when pursued solely from the home\r\nstandpoint, that farm management has as an interpretation of farming if\r\nnot related to agricultural and general economics. We need a\r\nconsideration of the problems of the home from the standpoint of other\r\nsocial institutions and with regard to its function in social\r\norganization. We need a clearer concept of the relation of the home to\r\nthe community and to community associations and activities.\r\n\r\nThe community institutions, the school, the church, and various\r\norganizations, have had too much of a tendency to compete with the home\r\nrather than to support and strengthen it. Thus the tendency of the\r\nschool has been to demand a larger and larger portion of the child's\r\ntime and to assume that because certain phases of education can be more\r\neconomically given in the school, that, therefore, it should take over\r\nas much of the educational function of the home as is possible; a\r\nconclusion which is by no means valid. In the home project a new\r\neducational principle has been discovered, which has far-reaching\r\nsignificance: for in it the school and the home coöperate, the school\r\noutlining, standardizing, and interpreting, while the home furnishes\r\nsupervision, advice, and encouragement. Thus, the home is stimulated to\r\nperform those educational functions in which it is superior, through a\r\ndefinite effort upon the part of the school to strengthen them. The same\r\nprinciple is being applied to education in hygiene. Why should not the\r\nchurch and Sunday school adopt similar methods and undertake a definite\r\nsystem of encouraging the home to give moral and religious education in\r\nan adequate fashion, rather than attempt to give homeopathic doses to\r\nchildren _en masse_? Why should not the church, or the school, or both,\r\ngive parents instruction and inspiration as to how to educate their\r\nchildren in matters of sex, about which they are in the best position to\r\ngain their confidence? Should not our clubs and social organizations,\r\nfor men and women, boys and girls, face the question, as to whether\r\ntheir aggregate activities are unduly competing with the home, and\r\nshould they not give definite thought as to how they may assist and\r\nstrengthen the basic institution of our social organization? If the home\r\nis the essential primary social institution, then its well-being should\r\ncommand the consideration of every institution of the community; for the\r\nfunction and objectives of the home cannot be determined solely by\r\neither its own ideals and purposes, or by the values established by the\r\nvarious special interest groups. The home and the community institutions\r\nare constantly in a process of adapting themselves to each other, and to\r\nthe extent that each recognizes the function of the other and is willing\r\nto coöperate rather than to compete, is the highest success of each made\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThis problem of the relation of the home to the community is a\r\nrelatively new one, and is largely the result of better means of\r\ncommunication which have enlarged the horizon of every farm home. When\r\nthe life of the child was almost wholly within the home and the\r\nneighborhood, the parents gave themselves little concern about the\r\ninfluence or conditions of the larger community. But when her children\r\ngo to a consolidated school and their school associates are unknown to\r\nher, when they attend the movies in the village, and when they read the\r\nlocal weekly or the city daily newspaper and the monthly magazines, so\r\nthat they know what is going on throughout the world, then, if she be\r\nwise, a mother commences to realize that the community is having a\r\ngrowing influence in shaping their character and that however ideal the\r\nhome may be, it is but a part of their lives. She commences to\r\nappreciate that she must have an understanding of the life and forces of\r\nthe community so that she may use her influence toward making their\r\nsocial environment what it should be and so that she may be able to make\r\nthe home so attractive that it will hold their primary interest and\r\nloyalty. Thus community problems of health, of education, of recreation\r\nand social life, and of religion become inter-related with those of the\r\nhome. The successful homemaker can no longer concern herself solely with\r\nhome-management, but must assume her share of responsibility in\r\ncommunity-management, or \"community housekeeping.\"\r\n\r\nWith the new responsibilities of suffrage rural women are following the\r\nexample of their city sisters in taking a larger interest in civic\r\naffairs and social legislation, and with a most wholesome influence on\r\ncommunity life. There is, however, some danger that while the men are\r\nengaged with their business problems, these social problems will be too\r\nlargely left to the women;[7] for without the sympathetic understanding\r\nand hearty coöperation of their husbands, rural women will find that\r\ntheir new social ideals will materialize but slowly. Here again, such\r\nfamily organizations as the Grange, the Church, and Farm and Home\r\nBureau, in which community activities engage both men and women are\r\npeculiarly serviceable.\r\n\r\nAn interesting example of how the family may function in community life\r\nis found in a small town in southern Michigan (Centerville) where the\r\npeople have established a coöperative motion picture theater, to which\r\nthe families buy season tickets, and where one may find whole families\r\ntogether enjoying the best pictures to the accompaniment of a community\r\norchestra. This is also being accomplished in many community buildings.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the home need not abdicate all of its old-time\r\nfunctions as a social center. A few years ago in attending a rural\r\ncommunity conference at the University of Illinois I was interested to\r\nhear a farm woman, a graduate of that university, tell how she and her\r\nneighbors had held amateur dramatic entertainments on their front\r\nverandas during the summer. The young people took the parts and the\r\naudience sat on the lawn, and thus many families were brought under the\r\ninfluence of the better homes who would not have thought of visiting\r\nthem. When winter came on, these entertainments were continued in a\r\nslightly different manner, so that neighboring families were brought\r\ninto contact without any tendency toward undue intimacy between families\r\nwhich would not associate otherwise. Family parties for young and old,\r\nshould by no means be abandoned in favor of community parties, however\r\nsatisfactory and attractive the latter may be.\r\n\r\nThe social responsibility of the rural home must receive new\r\nrecognition, for the day when we can live to ourselves in the enjoyment\r\nof a select group of personal friends is rapidly passing, if we are to\r\nhave satisfactory social conditions. It is one of the bad effects of the\r\nincreasing amount of tenancy in our best farming sections, and of the\r\nfrequent changing of farm ownership, that the shifting of residence\r\nmakes it difficult for the family to secure a satisfactory social\r\nposition in the community life.\r\n\r\nIn the last analysis, however, the largest contribution of the home to\r\nthe community and the best means of solving the problem of its relation\r\nto community life, is in the development of the best social attitudes\r\namong its members toward each other and toward the life of the\r\ncommunity; for all sound social organization is but an application of\r\nthe relations of the family to the affairs of larger social groups, and\r\nunless attitudes of mutual aid, common responsibility, and voluntary\r\nloyalty, are maintained in the home, so that its relations form a norm\r\nfor all other human groups, rural society will have lost the chief\r\ndynamic of social progress.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] From \"The Farm Woman's Problems,\" Florence E. Ward. U. S. Dept. of\r\nAgriculture, Circular 148 (1920).\r\n\r\n[6] _Ibid._, pp. 14, 15.\r\n\r\n[7] Benjamin Kidd claims that this superior interest of women in race\r\nwelfare is due to woman's cultural inheritance and that from the very\r\nnature of the division of labor between man and woman, man is less\r\ncapable than woman of devoting himself to human welfare. \"But the fact\r\nof the age which goes deeper than any other is that the male mind of the\r\nrace as the result of the conditions out of which it has come, is by\r\nitself incapable of rendering this service to civilization. It is in the\r\nmind of woman that the winning peoples of the world will find the\r\npsychic center of Power in the future.\"--\"The Science of Power,\" p.\r\n241.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE COMMUNITY'S PEOPLE AND HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe community is composed of people in a certain area, but the community\r\nmay be dead or it may be alive. The _life_ of the community is\r\ndetermined by the degree to which its people are able to act together\r\nfor the best promotion of their common welfare. This ability to act\r\ntogether will obviously depend upon the extent to which the people have\r\ncommon aims and purposes. If the people of a community form distinct\r\ngroups with diverse ideals and purposes, it will be much more difficult\r\nto secure that sympathy, tolerance, and understanding which are\r\nnecessary for united action, than if they are more alike. Yet it is just\r\nsuch diversity of interests of different elements in the community which\r\ngives rise to community problems and which brings about an appreciation\r\nof the need of developing community life.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, therefore, to have some appreciation of how the\r\ncharacteristics of its population influence community life.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, a community of people of different nationalities or\r\nraces, or sometimes even of people from different states, find it much\r\nmore difficult to secure a common loyalty than if they were of one\r\nstock. It is, of course, quite true that many an old community of a\r\nsingle stock is divided by family, religious or political feuds; yet\r\nusually there is more solidarity between people of common traditions and\r\nculture. The largest problem in the so-called \"Americanization\" of\r\nforeigners in rural communities is to get the natives to understand and\r\nappreciate the newcomers and to realize that the future of the community\r\ndepends upon mutual respect and good will. Had we a little more of an\r\nhistorical perspective, we would remember that all of our ancestors were\r\n\"foreigners\" but a few generations back. In almost every part of the\r\nUnited States are communities in which alien groups form one of the\r\nchief obstacles to a better community life. Throughout the South, the\r\nmost fundamental problem is that of a better understanding between the\r\ntwo races, and until some means of amicable adjustment is attempted,\r\nthere is little prospect for the development of community life. In some\r\nof our best agricultural sections there have been successive waves of\r\nimmigration of different nationalities. Thus in Dane County, Wisconsin,\r\nof which Madison--the state capital--is the county seat, Dr. J. H.\r\nKolb[8] describes communities in which Germans, Norwegians, and Swiss\r\nhave largely supplanted the original settlers from New England. In an\r\ninteresting study of Americanization in a community in the Connecticut\r\nValley of Massachusetts, John Daniels[9] has described how the French\r\nCanadians and Irish and then the Poles have taken up the land, and how\r\ngood feeling between them and the native Yankees was gradually\r\nestablished. On the other hand, a nearby community in southern New York\r\ncomes to mind, in which there is a colony of Bohemians, and another of\r\nFinns, which have been fairly successful in building up hill farms\r\ndeserted by the descendants of the original settlers, and yet the\r\ncommunity as a whole has done little toward making these people feel\r\nthat they are a part of its life, although their industry is one of its\r\nlargest economic assets. \"America is the home of the free\" and most of\r\nour people do desire a real democracy, but we seem to have assumed that\r\nit will develop spontaneously, and we have not appreciated that good\r\nwill and common understanding require some means of acquaintance and\r\nexchange of ideas, and that the interests and desires of all the people\r\nin a community, young and old, must receive recognition. Unless we can\r\nestablish democracy in our own local community, how can we expect it in\r\nthe state or nation?\r\n\r\nA second factor in community life is the age of its people. How often do\r\nyou find a community composed chiefly of elderly people which is\r\nprogressive? In the more progressive communities are not the middle-aged\r\nand young married people in control? The younger people desire better\r\nadvantages for themselves and particularly for their children, and so\r\nthey stand for better schools, better churches, and better facilities\r\nfor all phases of community life. It is largely for this reason, it\r\nseems to me, that older communities seem to have cycles of relative\r\ndecline and progress, according to the proportion of older and younger\r\npeople. It is to be hoped that in future generations the ability to\r\n\"keep young\" may become more common; indeed, this is one of the chief\r\nobjectives of modern education.\r\n\r\nThe density of population is also a determining factor with regard to\r\nmany phases of community life, for it is obviously much easier to carry\r\non many community activities where the people live fairly close together\r\nand not very far from the community center, than where the country is\r\nbut sparsely settled. Even with automobiles and telephones, the distance\r\nbetween homes will have a large influence in determining the nature of\r\ncommunity activities. One of the most difficult of our rural problems\r\nis how to bring to the people in sparsely settled regions the advantages\r\nwhich they rightly crave. It will be physically and economically\r\nimpossible for them to have as good opportunities as sections which are\r\nmore densely settled, but ways must be found whereby a larger degree of\r\nequality of opportunity is available to more thinly inhabited\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nChanges in population immediately affect community needs. Where\r\nimmigration is increasing rapidly, institutions such as schools,\r\nchurches, and stores are often inadequate, and there is every incentive\r\ntoward the development of community spirit and united effort to meet the\r\ncommon needs. On the other hand, in the older sections decreasing\r\npopulations make it impossible to maintain as many institutions as\r\nformerly. Many an eastern community has inherited two or three churches,\r\nwhich were once well filled, but which now merely serve to divide the\r\ncommunity as none of them are able to operate successfully, though it is\r\nobvious that unless the people are more loyal to their common needs than\r\nto their differences that the community will be unable to survive.\r\n\r\nIn relatively new communities, and often for several generations, the\r\ninfluence of the original settlement of the community may have a strong\r\neffect on its life. Thus where a new section is settled by acquaintances\r\nfrom an older community, by relatives, or those of one church, there is\r\na bond between them from the beginning, but where land is settled by\r\nhomesteaders from different sections, the process of establishing common\r\nideals and purposes is a gradual one. Many a community in the middle\r\nwest still bears the stamp of its original settlers. About in the center\r\nof West Virginia is the little community of French Creek which was\r\nsettled by a few New England families a little over a hundred years\r\nago. A recent study[10] of this community shows that it has had a\r\npowerful influence in the educational life of the whole state, and that\r\nits progressive spirit is largely traceable to \"an ancestry of energetic\r\npeople with high ideals which have been passed on by each generation.\"\r\nOn the other hand, in many cases this influence is soon lost, due to\r\nsome radical change in local conditions and the influx of new elements.\r\n\r\nIts history plays an exceedingly large rôle in advancing or retarding\r\ncommunity development. History and tradition are the memory of the\r\ncommunity; they bring to mind its past experiences. Common ancestors and\r\ncommon participation in important events in the past give a sense of\r\nidentity and heighten community consciousness. Pride in the history of\r\nthe community is like pride in a good family, and is a strong factor in\r\nmaintaining the standards of its people. Of course the past may be one\r\nof which no one is proud and which they may prefer to forget, but this\r\nis a spur to new endeavor as it is to a family to attain a new status.\r\n\r\nCommunity life is likely to be at a low ebb where there is but little\r\nknowledge of, or interest in, the history of its past. I was recently\r\nimpressed with this in visiting a small inland community, which was not\r\nwithout many events of interest in its earlier development. I failed,\r\nhowever, to find any connected records of the community's past or any of\r\nits people who know much of its history. So far as I could learn there\r\nhad been few celebrations or community activities for many years and\r\nthere was a general feeling that the community had been on the down\r\ngrade and needed redirection. It seemed to me that one of the things\r\nwhich might arouse community loyalty in this instance would be for its\r\npeople to clean up some of the old neighborhood cemeteries where many of\r\nthe early pioneers lie buried, and which are now grown up and unkept.\r\n\r\nThen I think of another community where every few years on important\r\nanniversary events the history of an organization or of the community as\r\na whole is related and often published in the local press. Its past has\r\nno more striking events than that of the locality last mentioned, but\r\nthese people have pride in their community and their loyalty is renewed\r\non these anniversary occasions.\r\n\r\nMiss Emily F. Hoag[11] has recently given a good picture of how the\r\nhistory of their community has been made to live in the hearts of the\r\npeople of Belleville, New York, through their loyalty to the old Union\r\nAcademy, and she has given a fine example of how a community may be\r\nbrought to a realization of the contribution which it has made to the\r\nlife of the state and nation.\r\n\r\nOnly by a knowledge of the community's history can the nature and origin\r\nof the attitudes of its people be understood. A generation or two ago,\r\nperchance, there was a quarrel between two families which was carried\r\ninto the school meeting, and to this day two factions have persisted.\r\nThe attitudes of the people in many a progressive town may be directly\r\ntraced to the influence of some outstanding leaders--a teacher,\r\nminister, or doctor, perhaps--long since gone to their reward. A village\r\nfire, the coming of a railroad or its deflection to a nearby town, a\r\nbank failure, a prohibition crusade, the establishment of a library are\r\nbut a few examples of events which form crises in the life of every\r\ncommunity and which have a far-reaching and subtle effect in moulding\r\nits character.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of a knowledge of its own history is, therefore, one of\r\nthe first duties of a community which seeks to understand itself so that\r\nit may better direct its life. Every community should maintain a record\r\nof its history, and have some means of preserving important historical\r\nmaterial. The New York legislature has recently passed an act\r\nauthorizing any township or village board to appoint a local historian,\r\nwithout salary, and to furnish safe storage for historical records. One\r\nof the most progressive rural communities in the country is the Quaker\r\nsettlement at Sandy Spring, Maryland,[12] whose first historian was\r\nappointed in 1863 and whose historian reads the record of the year at\r\neach annual meeting. These \"Annals\" form a most intimate account of the\r\ncommunity's progress. The custom of some rural newspapers of publishing\r\nlocal history of the past year on New Year's Day serves much the same\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nOne of the best means of encouraging historical appreciation, and one\r\nwhich is very generally neglected, is the teaching of local history in\r\nthe schools. Educators have learned that it is more pedagogical to\r\ncommence instruction in geography with the local environment of the\r\nchild, which it can know and understand, than to begin--as\r\nformerly--with the nebular hypothesis; but they are only commencing to\r\nappreciate that the same principle applies to the teaching of history.\r\nIs it not true that most children can glibly recite dates and events in\r\nthe history of their own and foreign countries, of whose significance\r\nthey have only a vague appreciation, but who never secure any real\r\nhistorical point of view or an appreciation of the importance of history\r\nbecause it has not been made concrete and intimate, as must be the case\r\nin considering local events? If national history is taught to develop\r\npatriotism, why should not local history be taught to inspire civic\r\nloyalty? Such a study of the efforts and sacrifices of former citizens\r\nwould bring a new sense of obligation to be worthy of the heritage they\r\nhave bequeathed, and would gradually establish an attitude of loyalty to\r\nthe community which would be considered as essential to respectability\r\nas devotion to one's country. Indeed, how can one be truly loyal to a\r\ngreat country which is mostly unknown to him if he is not loyal to the\r\npeople with whom he lives day by day in his home community?\r\n\r\nOne of the best means of reviving interest in the community's past is\r\nthrough the production of an historical pageant, which is discussed on\r\npage 161; for as the people act together the events of the past, they\r\ngain a new realization of what they owe to the life of the community in\r\nbygone days, and come to appreciate that men come and men go but the\r\ncommunity continues and perpetuates their influence for better or for\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nSocrates' injunction to \"know thyself\" is the epitome of wisdom for the\r\ncommunity as it is for the individual. The first step in this process of\r\nself-acquaintance is to secure an accurate knowledge of the kinds of\r\npeople which compose the community, and how its past is influencing its\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] \"Rural Primary Groups,\" a study of agricultural neighborhoods.\r\nResearch Bulletin 51, Agr.

This having\r\nthings in common is the basis of all community and is achieved only\r\nthrough the exchange of ideas by various means of communication. Without\r\ncommunication there would be no community and no civilization. It is\r\nman's ability to communicate through spoken and written language that\r\nhas made him _human_. Man is more than animal because he can exchange\r\nideas with his fellows, and can profit by the experience of the race.\r\nThis power of communication creates a new world for him in which he\r\nlives on a different plane from all other living things. The very words\r\n_community_ and _communication_, both derived from _communis_--common,\r\nindicate their relation to each other; _community_--the having in\r\ncommon, _communication_--the making common.[13]\r\n\r\nUntil modern times practically all communication between the masses of\r\nthe people was by word of mouth. The people of the old world lived\r\ntogether in villages which were largely self-dependent, and only the\r\nhigher classes were educated to read and write. There was little\r\nopportunity for contact with the outside world, and the people felt\r\nlittle need of better means of communication. It has been frequently\r\nasserted that isolation has been the chief rural problem in America. The\r\nreason for the dissatisfaction with life on isolated farms is better\r\nappreciated when we remember that during all previous history men have\r\nlived together in close association and their whole mode of thought,\r\ncustoms, attitudes, and desires have been formed in the intimate life of\r\ncompact groups. It is but natural, therefore, that life on the isolated\r\nfarm with but few contacts with others than immediate neighbors should\r\nbecome irksome and that town and city have had a peculiar attraction for\r\nfarm people.\r\n\r\nWe cannot here examine the causes and history of the development of our\r\nmodern means of communication, but we must recognize that it is due to\r\nthem that rural community life as we are coming to know it in the United\r\nStates is made possible. Without these newer facilities for more\r\nfrequent association and exchange of ideas, rural life would still be\r\nconfined to the small local neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the railroad and trolley have abolished the isolation\r\nof the rural community and have made possible the diversion of local\r\ninterests and loyalties to larger centers. Thus while communication aids\r\nthe integration of the community it affords equal facilities for its\r\ndisruption. Doubtless some of the smaller community centers will be\r\nunable to compete with the attraction of nearby larger centers, but\r\nthere seems no good reason to believe that better communication will\r\ninjure the best life of communities which are of sufficient size to\r\nsupport the institutions which will command local loyalty. This dual\r\ninfluence of means of communication on the internal and external\r\nrelations of rural communities creates some of the chief problems of\r\nrural social organization, for the increase of means of communication in\r\nthe past two or three generations has been more momentous and has had a\r\nmore far-reaching effect on human relations than in all the previous\r\ncenturies since the invention of writing.\r\n\r\nA brief survey of the more important of these new agencies will indicate\r\nhow they affect the relations of the farmer to his community and to\r\nother communities. These may be considered under the two general heads\r\nof means of transportation, and means for the exchange of ideas.\r\n\r\nAs long as transportation was by wagon and by boat, commerce was slow\r\nand expensive; each community was compelled to be largely\r\nself-dependent, and life was isolated to an extent that it is difficult\r\nfor us to conceive. Anderson has well stated the situation when he says:\r\n\r\n      \"Merchandise and produce that could not stand a freight of\r\n      fifteen dollars per ton could not be carried overland to a\r\n      consumer one hundred and fifty miles from the point of\r\n      production; as roads were, a distance of fifty miles from\r\n      the market often made industrial independence\r\n      expedient.\"[14]\r\n\r\nIt was the steam railroad which made larger markets available, made\r\npossible the growth of our large cities and the opening up of new lands\r\ndistant from markets. The railroad and manufacturing by power machinery\r\nput an end to the \"age of homespun,\" and made it more profitable for the\r\nfarmer to sell his products and to purchase his manufactured goods in\r\nexchange. The railroad, and the markets which it made available, changed\r\nthe village center from a place of local barter to a shipping point and\r\nso tended to center the economic life of larger areas in the villages\r\nwith railroad stations. Better local roads were necessary and business\r\ntended to become centralized in the village. The numerous wayside\r\ntaverns along the main highways disappeared, as did the neighborhood\r\nmill and blacksmith shop. The railroad, more than any other one factor,\r\nhas determined the location of our rural community centers.\r\n\r\nThe electric railroad made the village centers more available to farm\r\npeople and gave transportation facilities to many villages without\r\nrailroads, but it also made it possible for the people of smaller\r\ncommunities to go to the larger centers for trading and other\r\nadvantages. Trolleys have made it possible for many farm children to get\r\nto high school who could not otherwise have attended and have enabled\r\nthose living near them to more easily get back and forth from the\r\nvillage centers for all phases of community life. On the whole, however,\r\nthey have probably carried more traffic between communities, and it\r\nseems strange that they have not more generally been able to find a\r\nprofit in hauling produce from the farms to the nearest markets or\r\nshipping stations.\r\n\r\nOf more importance to community life has been the development of good\r\nroads, a movement which did not get under way until the present century\r\nand which was chiefly due to the rural free mail delivery and the\r\nautomobile. The change in rural life due to automotive vehicles can\r\nhardly be exaggerated. In our best agricultural states practically every\r\nfarmer has his automobile. He can get to the community center as quickly\r\nas the business man or laborer gets to his work in the average city, and\r\ncan go to the county seat or neighboring city as quickly as one can\r\ndrive to the business section from the more distant parts of New York or\r\nChicago. Auto-bus lines radiate from most of our small cities, and auto\r\ntrucks not only bring freight from nearby wholesale centers, but are\r\nrapidly supplanting horses for hauling farm produce to the shipping\r\nstation or market.\r\n\r\nAs good roads have been due chiefly to state and county, and more\r\nrecently to national aid, it is but natural that they should have been\r\nconstructed where the traffic is heaviest connecting the main centers.\r\nWhat is now most needed to build up the local communities is a\r\nsystematic development of the principal local roads radiating from the\r\ncommunity centers.\r\n\r\nGood roads and automobiles have made possible a new sort of a local\r\ncommunity, which could never have existed without them. Consider the\r\npresent possibility of consolidated schools with auto-busses to haul the\r\nchildren; the numbers of automobiles which come in from the farms to\r\nevery village center where there is a band concert or movie show; the\r\nability to get in the \"flivver\" after supper and ride to a relative's or\r\nfriend's on the other side of the town and be back for early bedtime;\r\nand one can perceive how the people in a community area are bound\r\ntogether and develop common interests in new advantages made possible by\r\ntheir ability to get together easily and quickly. How could the county\r\nagricultural agent or the visiting nurse cover a county as effectively\r\nas they now do without the automobile? The rural community can now enjoy\r\nthe services of expert paid executives in many fields of work as diverse\r\nas a county commercial club secretary, a Boy Scout leader, a Sunday\r\nschool executive, or county health officer, because the county has\r\nbecome a unit which can be covered as easily as a city and is large\r\nenough to support such a division of labor as no one community could\r\nenjoy. We shall have occasion to refer to many county organizations and\r\nagencies which not only build up the county and the county seat, but\r\nwhich strengthen the life of every community which they serve, and whose\r\nwork is very largely possible because of good roads and automobiles.\r\nWhere bad roads still exist many of these services must wait and less\r\ncommunity life is possible.\r\n\r\nNor does the home lose with the community advancement due to better\r\ntransportation. Surely it is better to have the children living at home\r\nthan boarding in the village while they attend high school; the doctor\r\nis secured more quickly and the visiting nurse is available; and the\r\nfamily can come and go as a family because less time is required and\r\nthere is no waiting for the horses to feed, or to get rested.\r\n\r\nIt is true of course that the automobile makes it possible for people to\r\ngo to the larger towns and other village centers, and to visit their\r\nparticular friends and relatives in neighboring communities, and thus\r\nseems to furnish means for breaking down and stratifying community life.\r\nThese tendencies exist, but they will not seriously injure the community\r\nwhich has anything worth while for its people. Better transportation\r\nsimply makes possible a more highly organized community life, and any\r\ncomplex organization is the more easily deranged; a complex machine or a\r\nhigh-bred animal is more susceptible to injury than a simple tool or\r\nscrub. Many ministers have railed against the automobile, while others\r\nhave used it to fill their pews. We cannot get away from that oldest of\r\nparadoxes, first learned by Father Adam, that every new good has\r\npossibilities of evil. A certain type of mind has always enjoyed\r\ncondemning every new invention as \"of the Devil,\" and yet the world wags\r\non and no one who knows them would go back to \"the good old days.\"\r\n\r\nThe automobile has brought new ideas both to the community and to the\r\nfarm and home. Farmers and their wives are traveling by auto much more\r\nthan they ever did by train, and it is impossible not to pick up new\r\nideas. One of the most effective educational devices is the farm tour in\r\nwhich a group of Farm Bureau members travel from one farm to another\r\nstudying the methods of farming, and the women have adopted the idea for\r\nan inspection of farm homes.\r\n\r\nTo discuss all the effects of automotive vehicles--cycle, car, truck,\r\nbus, and tractor--on farm life would fill a book in itself: space\r\nforbids except for incidental mention in the following chapters.\r\n\r\nTurning to the mechanisms for the transmission of ideas, we appreciate\r\nthe even more wonderful inventions which have brought the whole world to\r\nthe farmer's door.\r\n\r\nA generation ago farmers went several miles to the nearest postoffice\r\nfor their mail, and usually got it but two or three times a week. To-day\r\nover the greater part of the country it is delivered to them daily, and\r\nthey can ship small packages by parcels post from their doors. This\r\ndaily delivery has greatly widened the circulation of the daily\r\nnewspapers and magazines of all sorts, and has given farm people a new\r\nknowledge and a livelier interest in city and world-wide affairs. The\r\nparcel post has made the mail-order business, but it is even more\r\nbeneficial to the local merchant who can fill a telephone order and mail\r\nit to a customer for less expense than delivery costs in the city.\r\nCorrespondence and advertising by farm people have greatly increased. It\r\nis true that the abolition of many rural postoffices has destroyed an\r\nold-time rendezvous, but farmers probably go to the community center\r\nmore frequently than formerly. A more unfortunate feature of the rural\r\ndelivery service is that it often gives the farmer a mail address at a\r\npostoffice of a community where he rarely goes, and fails to indicate\r\nthe community in which he is located to one unacquainted with the local\r\ngeography (see page 232).\r\n\r\nEven more important as an aid to community activities is the telephone.\r\nVisiting is now done more over the phone than in person, but\r\nconversation can be had with any one in the community at any time, and\r\nisolation is banished. The telephone has brought a larger protection to\r\nthe farm home in calling the doctor, police, or fire assistance. The\r\neconomic value of the phone soon became apparent for the distribution of\r\nmarket reports and weather forecasts or for ordering goods or repairs\r\nfrom town, and the marvelous wireless telephone will greatly extend\r\nthese services. The Extension Service of the Kansas Agricultural College\r\nis installing a wireless outfit which will receive market and weather\r\nreports and will transmit them to the farm bureau offices at the county\r\nseats, where they may be relayed through the local telephones to every\r\nfarmer. Thus world-wide conditions may be flashed to the farmer's\r\nfireside. Within the community the telephone has made possible a degree\r\nof organization hitherto impossible. Meetings are called, committees are\r\nassembled, or their business is done over the phone, so that both social\r\nand economic life are greatly stimulated.\r\n\r\nThe farmer is sometimes chided for not having organized rural life more\r\neffectively. The simple reason is that he has not had the mechanisms\r\nwhereby he could do so. With only mud roads and horses people could get\r\ntogether but infrequently, and arrangements had to be made when they\r\nwere together. City life was better organized because people could get\r\ntogether more easily. To-day both time and space have been so largely\r\novercome that communication in the country is almost as rapid as in the\r\ncity and more effective organization is possible.\r\n\r\nBetter transportation, mail, and telephone service have made available\r\nagencies for the communication of ideas, previously accessible only to\r\nthe few or patronized so infrequently by those further away as to\r\nfurnish too small a constituency for their successful maintenance. The\r\nfree public library is a powerful educational agency, but many a\r\ncommunity has been too small for its support. Now county library systems\r\nare being organized--thanks to automobiles--which give branch stations\r\nto every community (see p. 102). Lyceum courses of lectures and\r\nentertainments, chautauqua courses, public forums for the discussion of\r\ncurrent problems, and last, but not least, the moving picture shows with\r\ntheir pictures of important events from all parts of the world and\r\nshowing life from Central Africa to the Antipodes, all of these are\r\nagencies for bringing new ideas to the rural community, and are becoming\r\nincreasingly common as better transportation makes it possible for the\r\npeople to utilize them. The fact that these agencies must be located\r\nwhere they can serve the largest number of people, determines their\r\nlocation at the community centers and they are thus a large factor in\r\nunifying the community.\r\n\r\nModern transportation has abolished the isolation of the farm and new\r\nmeans of communication have freed the spirit of the farmer and brought\r\nthe world to his doors. Together they make possible so many\r\nsatisfactions heretofore only available to the cities, as to quite\r\nrevolutionize the whole aspect of rural life. They give a new position\r\nto the rural community and to the farmer's status in it.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] Community is derived from the Old English word _commonty_ which\r\ncame to mean \"the body of the common people, commons.\" Communication is\r\nfrom the Latin _communicare_, also derived from _communis_--common, and\r\n_ic_ (the formative of factitive verbs)--to make, or to make common.\r\n\r\n[14] \"The Country Town,\" p. 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE FARM AND THE VILLAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that an active community must focus its life at some\r\ncenter, and that this center is usually a village which has been\r\nestablished primarily for business purposes. The relation of the\r\nAmerican village to the surrounding farms is historically unique and is\r\nlargely due to the rapidity and ease with which large areas of the\r\nUnited States were settled after the advent of railroads. In the\r\ncolonial period and the early days of the New West, every settlement was\r\nso isolated that it was obliged to be largely self-sufficient.\r\nTransportation was slow and uncertain and prohibitive for other than the\r\nnecessities which could not be locally produced. Under these conditions\r\nthe farmer and village business man were so inter-dependent that they\r\nwere forced to consider each other's interests. But when settlement\r\nbecame safer and transportation easier the homesteaders took up their\r\nclaims without relation to village connections; they traded where it was\r\nmost convenient, and their social life centered largely in the immediate\r\nneighborhood and in the district school and country church. On the other\r\nhand the village was settled by men who came primarily for business. The\r\nspirit of the age was that of competition and they came primarily for\r\nprofits. Their business came from the farms, but they felt little sense\r\nof obligation to them. Every village was a potential city in their eyes\r\nand its growth and the rise of real estate values was of more concern to\r\nthem than the development of the community's basic industry of\r\nagriculture. The village craftsman and business man gets most of his\r\nliving from the farms and it should be to his interest to give them the\r\nbest of service, but more and more he has become primarily a business\r\nman or craftsman, coming to the village to \"make money\" and moving on\r\nwhen he sees better opportunities elsewhere. His business and craft\r\naffiliations link him to the centers of commercial and industrial life\r\nin the cities, and he is strongly inclined to take the city's point of\r\nview. Particularly has this been the case with the country banker who\r\nhas so largely controlled the economic life of the village and\r\ncountryside. Too often he has inevitably been more largely influenced by\r\nthe interests of eastern capital and the mortgage owners than by the\r\nreal needs of his local constituency.\r\n\r\nThe result has been an increasing friction between the villages and the\r\nfarms, and we have come to think of them as two separate groups or\r\ninterests rather than as essential and inter-dependent parts of a social\r\narea--the community. The literature of country life and of rural\r\nsociology has very rightly recognized the existing situation, but many\r\nwriters seem to accept the division between village and farm as\r\ninevitable, and even question whether there can be a rural community of\r\nthe type herein described, rather than to recognize that this is but a\r\nnecessary stage in the beginning of community life, due to the mode of\r\nsettlement and temporary conditions.\r\n\r\nThis friction between farmer and villager has been most acute in the\r\nMiddle West and has found its extreme expression in the Non-partisan\r\nLeague Movement, which has engendered a degree of bitterness between the\r\ntwo factions which cannot be permanently maintained without serious\r\ninjury to their common interests. This, however, is only an attempt of\r\nthe farmers to secure redress through political control, and is but the\r\npolitical form of expression of a protest which is being more\r\neffectively made as an economic movement through coöperative buying and\r\nselling agencies, particularly strong in Kansas and Nebraska, but\r\nrapidly spreading throughout the country.\r\n\r\nSome rural leaders would have us believe that the interests of the\r\nvillage and the farm are fundamentally antagonistic and irreconcilable.\r\nThey advocate that the consolidated school or high school be placed in\r\nthe open country where it will be uncontaminated by the urban-mindedness\r\nof the village; that the grange is the farmers' organization and is\r\nsufficient for him and has no need of affiliating itself with the\r\naffairs of the village; that the farmers should develop their own\r\ncoöperative stores and selling agencies so that they can be economically\r\nindependent of the \"parasitic\" trader of the village. Such a naïve point\r\nof view has a certain logical simplicity which is based on the\r\npresupposition that conflict is inevitable and that justice and equity\r\ncan be secured only through dominance. The same line of reasoning finds\r\nno solution of the problem of capital and labor, or of the interests of\r\nproducer as over against consumer, except in strong organization and\r\neternal economic conflict. It is apparent that there is much\r\njustification for this view and that it seems in many cases to be a\r\nnecessary stage in the adjustment of interests, but that it is either\r\ninevitable or a permanent necessity is controverted both by experience\r\nand by a more thorough analysis of the relationships involved.\r\n\r\nThere is no gainsaying the fact that conflict has been one of the chief\r\nagencies of human progress in the past; but neither can it be disputed\r\nthat coöperation, or mutual aid, has been of equal importance. Neither\r\nattitude can be conceived as primary or dominant; they have interacted\r\nthroughout the history of mankind. Fundamentally, the problem of the\r\nrelationship of these two phases of life is much the same as that of the\r\nnature and function of good and evil. The one cannot exist without the\r\nother, and both are relative terms. Our present thought on these\r\nproblems has been too largely dominated by a wrong interpretation of the\r\ntheory of the survival of the fittest as the primary force in human\r\nevolution. We have assumed, and the German militarists carried the\r\ndoctrine to a logical conclusion, that this hypothesis gave the sanction\r\nof a biological law to a competitive struggle between men. But such an\r\ninference was explicitly denied by Charles Darwin,[15] and has no\r\nbiological foundation. The struggle he described is between species and\r\nnot between members of the same species. On the other hand, we find\r\nthroughout nature that those species have been most successful which\r\nhave developed the most effective means of mutual aid.[16] Thus our\r\neconomic and political thought has been dominated for the past two or\r\nthree generations with a blind worship of the dogma of unrestrained\r\ncompetition, which has no basis of proof either in biological or social\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nWhen we examine what has gone on in the older sections of our country\r\nand project the present tendencies into the future, we get a different\r\npoint of view, and come to see that only by an adjustment of the\r\nrelations of the village and the farm to each other can the best life of\r\nboth be secured. We shall have occasion in subsequent chapters to\r\nconsider the social and political problems involved, but let us here\r\ndiscuss merely the economic relations, which have been the chief source\r\nof discord.\r\n\r\nIn the first place if we examine the situation in the older parts of the\r\ncountry we find a much more cordial relation between village and country\r\nthan farther west, and a greater sense of belonging to a community. The\r\nreasons for this cannot be discussed in detail, but a large factor is\r\nthe increasing tendency to centralize institutions; school, church,\r\ngrange, lodge, stores, etc.; in the village as the country becomes\r\nolder, roads are better, and higher standards develop. Furthermore, the\r\nrelative status of the farmer changes the situation. In the older parts\r\nof the country most of the capital needed to supply credit to farmers\r\nand their business organizations comes from within the locality, whereas\r\nin the newer sections they are dependent upon outside capital. In the\r\nolder sections where land has become more valuable and wealth has\r\naccumulated, the farmer as well as the villager is a bank director, and\r\nthe amount of capital which the farmer has invested in his business is\r\noften much greater than that of the village business man. When the\r\nfarmer comes into town in his first-class automobile as frequently as he\r\ndesires, he has a very different status from former days. The\r\n\"banker-farmer\" movement, which started as an effort of the banker to\r\nassist the farmer in better methods of production and marketing, has now\r\nbecome a \"farmer-banker\" movement in which the country banker has been\r\nforced to give new thought to the credit facilities of his patrons, and\r\nis already challenging the justice of the country's credit facilities\r\nbeing dominated by the large city banks which are chiefly interested in\r\nfinancing industry and commerce.\r\n\r\nThere is no question that in many a rural town there are too many\r\nstores, as there are in the cities, that in many cases their service is\r\nvery inefficient, and occasionally their prices are exorbitant, but\r\nseveral forces are already tending to remedy these evils where they\r\noccur, and improvement may be hastened by intelligent and constructive\r\ndiscussion. Thus exorbitant prices or poor service has made possible the\r\nlarge sales of the mail-order houses, but the total volume of their\r\nbusiness in most localities is relatively small and their competition\r\nhas probably been beneficial to the wide-awake merchant. For first-class\r\nmerchants have been able to show that they can meet the mail-order\r\nprices if the customer is willing to pay cash, and the advertising of\r\nthe mail-order houses has undoubtedly increased the wants of the average\r\nfarm household. In a recent address Dr. C. J. Galpin has pointed out\r\nthat one of the shortcomings of the average country merchant is that he\r\nhas not studied the needs of his patrons and brought to their attention\r\nnew inventions and the better grades of goods. He holds that the higher\r\nstandard of living of city people is largely due to the fact that\r\nattractive goods and better equipment are constantly brought to their\r\nattention in the shop windows and by salesmen.\r\n\r\nThe coöperative buying of farm supplies and machinery, which is now\r\nassuming such large proportions, is due not merely to an effort to\r\nsecure lower prices, but to secure better goods. It is a notorious fact\r\nthat for many years the farmer has had to buy inferior fertilizers and\r\nfeeds from local dealers because they were all he could get. Both mixed\r\nfeeds and fertilizers have been sold under certain brands on much the\r\nsame principle as patent medicines, until the farmer has organized his\r\nown agencies to secure their manufacture in accordance with the best\r\nscientific formulas. This has been primarily due to a short-sighted\r\npolicy on the part of manufacturers, but it has done greater injury to\r\nthe retailer who, in general, has made little effort to learn the real\r\nneeds of his trade and supply it with the best goods. The same has been\r\ntrue of seeds and agricultural machinery. As a result of this one of the\r\nchief claims of such a coöperative agency as the New York\r\nGrange-League-Federation Exchange is that it is able not only to sell at\r\na lower price but to furnish the best quality. The wide-awake country\r\nmerchant has been keen to appreciate these facts and wherever he has\r\nstudied his trade and devoted himself to its interests he has built up a\r\nsuccessful business. The \"Country Gentleman\" has done a real service in\r\nrecently publishing a series of articles by A. B. MacDonald which have\r\ndescribed the successes of a few of the outstanding \"Big Country\r\nMerchants.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"chain store\" has not as yet invaded the village, but it is rapidly\r\ngaining a foothold in the smaller cities and village merchants may as\r\nwell prepare for its competition, for there seems no good reason why its\r\ngreater buying power and superior organization should not enable it to\r\nundersell the local merchant if the customer is willing to pay cash. As\r\nyet all chain stores are on a cash basis and this would seem to prevent\r\ntheir gaining much of the business of the farmer who has depended on\r\nlong time credit. But the coöperative stores, which do business only for\r\ncash, have solved the credit problem by establishing credit facilities\r\nwhereby short-time loans may be made and a credit established against\r\nwhich purchases are charged. There is no question that both farmer and\r\nmerchant would be better off if credit were carried by a financial\r\ninstitution. The farmer is being rapidly educated in business practices,\r\nand it will be surprising if some enterprising corporation does not\r\nestablish a chain of village stores which will do a cash business, but\r\nwhich will arrange for separate credit on a strictly business basis. If\r\none looks at the trend of business in the cities and towns during recent\r\nyears, he cannot but come to the conviction that either country\r\nmerchants will have to get together so as to pool their purchasing power\r\nand get the advantages of expert assistance in advertising, accounting,\r\nstore arrangement, and other technical services which the chain store\r\nenjoys, or they will be forced to content themselves with the poorer and\r\nless profitable class of trade. I have seen no studies of the matter,\r\nbut it would be interesting to know how large an amount of farmer trade\r\nis now enjoyed by the chain groceries in our larger towns. My own\r\nimpression is that they are a much more serious competitor of the small\r\ncountry merchant than is the mail-order house. These are but a few of\r\nthe forces which will bring better service from the village merchant.\r\n\r\nThere are also ways in which farmers may secure better service without\r\nattempting to operate a coöperative store of their own or deserting the\r\nlocal merchants. Farm Bureau associations have in numerous cases made\r\narrangements with a local dealer whereby he would handle their seeds,\r\nfertilizers, or spraying materials at a specified rate of profit, upon\r\ncondition that they give him all their trade in these articles and place\r\ntheir orders in advance. This principle of collective buying through an\r\nestablished merchant at an agreed rate of profit has much to commend it,\r\nand is being utilized by the Grange-League-Federation Exchange in New\r\nYork state to take care of its local business as far as possible. The\r\nfact is that the profits of a strictly coöperative store, after paying\r\nthe salary of a competent manager and other costs of operation, which\r\nwould make a very attractive income for a single merchant, do not make a\r\ndividend to each of its many patrons much more than a good rate of\r\ninterest on the total cost of purchases. It may as well be recognized\r\nthat unless there be a strong loyalty to the coöperative principle by a\r\nconsiderable group of patrons and unless there be peculiar need of a\r\ncoöperative store that it is not a mechanism which will automatically\r\nsecure much lower prices or superior service, for the success of the\r\nenterprise depends primarily on the manager and if he be competent, he\r\nmust be paid sufficient to command not only his services but his loyalty\r\nand initiative. The coöperative store will find it good business to have\r\na profit-sharing arrangement with its manager and employees, if it\r\nexpects to secure the same service from them that may be secured from\r\nthe better merchants. On the other hand, if by pooling their buying\r\npower a group of farmers can throw their business to one merchant in\r\nconsideration of his selling at a specified profit, even if only for a\r\nparticular line of goods, they get the advantage of their collective\r\npurchasing power and have none of the responsibility for maintaining the\r\nbusiness. Although it is my belief that the coöperative principle is\r\nessentially sound and must ultimately dominate our business life, yet it\r\nwill need to find means of giving larger incentive to its managers if it\r\nis to compete with the best individual business men. After all, what is\r\nwanted is to get business on a functional basis, and if this can be\r\naccomplished by means of collective buying through an established\r\nbusiness which furnishes its own capital and management, the farmer is\r\nthe gainer. The essential thing is that business be put on the basis of\r\npublic service rather than private profit. When that principle is\r\nrecognized as being the only sound basis of our economic system, then\r\nthe methods of business organization will be determined by what\r\nexperience shows to be most advantageous to the community, and it may\r\nwell be that true \"_coöperative competition_\" between individual\r\nmerchants and coöperative stores may exist side by side with advantage\r\nto all concerned.\r\n\r\nAnother factor in rural community life is the increase of industrial\r\nestablishments in villages and small towns. There can be no question\r\nthat the centralization of industry in our large cities, which has\r\nproceeded so rapidly since the development of steam power, has now\r\npassed its maximum and that there will be a considerable\r\ndecentralization of certain industries which can be operated profitably\r\nin small units. The metropolitan city has passed its maximum of\r\neconomic efficiency for many phases of manufacturing, if economic\r\nefficiency is judged by its power to produce \"well-being,\" rather than\r\nmere wealth. We have been obsessed with the glamour of the bigness of\r\nthe modern city and we are but beginning to seriously question its real\r\nefficiency. The possibility of superior living conditions in a small\r\ntown are now being recognized both by employer and laborer, and better\r\ntransportation and the development of electric power lines make possible\r\nthe organization of certain of our large industries in small units. As\r\nthis process proceeds the business of the village and small town will no\r\nlonger be chiefly dependent on agriculture and there will be a further\r\nneed for accommodation of the different interests of the community. Here\r\nagain, some see only loss to rural life; but if one examines the\r\nsituation more thoroughly, mutual advantages are equally apparent. If\r\nthe farmers are organized for coöperative selling, they will be\r\nbenefited by the better local markets, which are the backbone of the\r\nagricultural economy of so prosperous a country as France. Certain local\r\nindustries, whose production is of a seasonal nature, might so arrange\r\ntheir operation that some of their labor might be available to work on\r\nthe neighboring farms during the rush season. Even more important would\r\nbe the increased purchasing power of the community, making possible\r\nbetter stores and business and professional services of all sorts, and\r\nthe increase of wealth which would make possible the support of better\r\nschools, churches, and social advantages of all sorts. It is, of course,\r\ntrue that the introduction of industry in not a few cases seems to have\r\nlowered the standards of community life, but this is by no means\r\nuniversal or inevitable.\r\n\r\nOne of the unfortunate phases of the efforts of small communities to\r\nsecure industrial plants is that they often secure establishments which\r\nare not adapted to local conditions or whose financial status is\r\ninsecure, and the enterprise inevitably results in failure, with\r\ndiscouragement to all concerned. There is great need for county chambers\r\nof commerce or commercial clubs with skilled commercial executives as\r\nsecretaries who can give the same expert service to the business life of\r\nthe small rural communities that the cities now have. The business life\r\nof the community might profit as much from such a service as the farms\r\nhave from the expert assistance afforded through the Farm Bureaus.[17]\r\n\r\nWe have been considering the economic relations of the farm and the\r\nvillage as affecting community life, for they are at present the chief\r\nfactor in creating community interest, as well as the leading cause of\r\ngroup friction. The rural community of to-day is primarily an economic\r\nunit, but in the future it seems probable that business will occupy a\r\nrelatively less important place than the social activities of the\r\ncommunity center. Not that there will necessarily be less business,\r\nalthough the widening of markets constantly tends to take business from\r\nthe local centers, but that business will be more efficient and less\r\ncompetitive; business will not occupy so large a share of attention, but\r\nwill take its rightful place as a means to an end, while the community\r\nwill take more interest in those institutions which actively promote all\r\nphases of its higher life, of health, education, art, sociability, and\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nThese social institutions will increase in relative importance and they\r\nmust be located at the community center if they are to have a sufficient\r\nconstituency to be efficient in their work and command the loyalty of\r\nrural people. Inasmuch as both farmer and villager are necessary for the\r\nadequate support of church, lodge, school, and other community\r\norganizations, they cannot be expected to work together in these\r\nactivities if one is antagonistic to the other, or if the one is helping\r\nto put the other out of business. The farmer has had many grievances\r\nagainst the townsman, but the fault has not been entirely on one side,\r\nand only by mutual support and the recognition of their dependent\r\ninterests can a satisfactory community life be maintained. The root of\r\nthe whole trouble lies in the imaginary division of the community into\r\ntown and country. With the realization that their common interests are\r\nessential and that their differences are due to lack of proper\r\nadjustment, many of these difficulties will be alleviated. It is my\r\nexperience that in the most successful communities, the farmers speak of\r\n\"our\" town, they are proud of \"our\" bank, and \"our\" stores, school, and\r\nchurches are the best in the region. Such loyalty is the best of\r\nevidence that the business men of the town have devoted themselves to\r\nsupplying the farmers' needs, and that there is mutual understanding\r\nbetween them. Only by a common loyalty to mutual service can the true\r\ncommunity exist.\r\n\r\nFarmers need the village and it should be to them \"our town,\" of whose\r\nsuccesses and improvements they are proud. As the villagers cannot exist\r\nwithout the farmers they should be interested in supporting every\r\nmovement for the farmers' weal. As they have more frequent contacts with\r\nother centers and with cities, they will be the first to bring many new\r\nideas and suggestions to the community, but they must realize that only\r\nas all elements of the community are agreed will any new movement be\r\npermanently successful. There must be loyalty to farm leaders as well as\r\nto those of the village. Indeed, the most successful rural communities\r\nare those in which all are one big community family whose institutional\r\ninterests center in the village.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] See George Nasmyth, \"Social Progress and the Darwinian Theory.\"\r\n\r\n[16] See P. Kropotkin, \"Mutual Aid.\"\r\n\r\n[17] See L. H. Bailey, \"The Place of the Village in the Country-Life\r\nMovement,\" York State Rural Problems, II, 148. Albany, N. Y., 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCOMMUNITY ASPECTS OF THE FARM BUSINESS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the days of the pioneer the farm business was hardly affected by\r\ncommunity conditions. A general store where necessities could be\r\npurchased, a mill where grain could be ground, and a blacksmith shop\r\nwere about the only necessary business agencies. The farm was largely\r\nself-sufficient and there was but little real community life. Nor was\r\nthere much change in the next generation or two among the farmers who\r\nbuilt substantial homes, supported their neighborhood churches and\r\nschools, and with the free labor of a good-sized family made a\r\ncomfortable living. Their interests were chiefly in their families and\r\nneighbors, and questions of local government were about the only\r\ncommunity bond. When new sections of the country were opened up by\r\nrailroads and with the growth of cities farm lands increased rapidly in\r\nvalue, there was an era of speculative farming, which Dr. Warren H.\r\nWilson has called the era of the \"exploiter.\"[18] A farm was bought with\r\nan idea of its improvement and resale at a good profit, and many farmers\r\nmoved from one section to another in search of new land which was both\r\nfertile and cheap.[19] The era of land speculation has by no means\r\npassed, as has been learned to their sorrow by many who bought farms at\r\ninflated prices during the World War, and whenever there is a sudden\r\nrise in land values, speculation will doubtless recur. On the other\r\nhand, as cheap lands become scarce, as the better lands become more\r\nvaluable and the amount of capital required to equip and operate a farm\r\nin the better agricultural sections increases, there will be less\r\ntendency to be on the lookout for a profitable sale and the farm\r\nbusiness will become more permanent because of the large effort and\r\ncapital expended in the enterprise and the consequent attachment of the\r\nowner. A man with a considerable investment does not care to move\r\nfrequently. Thus higher land values--inevitable with an increasing\r\npopulation--will favor a more permanent type of farming, conducted on\r\nscientific and business principles, of what Dr. Wilson calls the\r\n\"husbandman\" type. This type of farmer not only desires but requires\r\nbetter institutions of all sorts, which can only be maintained at a\r\ncommunity center. Thus permanency of ownership of farm operators\r\nconduces to community development.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, the rise of values of the best land seems to\r\nencourage tenancy rather than ownership, for tenancy is greatest and\r\nincreases most on the best farm lands. The general economic aspects and\r\nthe ultimate solution of the tenancy problem are national rather than\r\nlocal problems. The effect of tenancy as it now exists, with a frequent\r\nshifting from one community to another, is, however, a very serious\r\ncommunity problem, for all observers agree that the maintenance of a\r\nsatisfactory standard of community life is much more difficult where\r\ntenancy predominates.\r\n\r\nOne important economic aspect of tenancy is that tenants, who are\r\nfrequently moving, will less readily and effectively affiliate in\r\ncoöperative enterprises, and we shall see that coöperative organizations\r\nhave a large influence in promoting the solidarity of the rural\r\ncommunity. This has been well brought out by one of our best students\r\nof the tenancy problem, Dr. C. L. Stewart, who says:\r\n\r\n      \"Farming efficiency in the future, however, will probably\r\n      consist to a greater extent in the ability to increase net\r\n      profits through coöperative dealing with the market. The\r\n      efficiency test must, therefore, rule more strongly against\r\n      operators of the tenures, whose characteristics are opposed\r\n      to successful coöperative effort on their part.\r\n\r\n      \"That tenants,\" he continues, \"changing from farm to farm at\r\n      more or less short intervals, should generally be more\r\n      active and successful than owners in building up coöperative\r\n      organizations is hardly in the line of reason.... If in the\r\n      future, coöperation assumes forms requiring greater\r\n      permanency of membership in the societies, greater intimacy\r\n      of acquaintance among the members, or greater investment per\r\n      member, the tenants will doubtless find themselves\r\n      handicapped in their relation thereto.\"[20]\r\n\r\nThe effect of a large percentage of tenants is even more serious upon\r\nthe social side of community life. Those who have studied the problem\r\nare agreed that both schools and churches tend to be inferior in tenant\r\ncommunities. There is little \"chance of development of deep friendships\r\nand associations which give vitality to church life\" where a large\r\nproportion of the tenants are frequently moving, nor can they give as\r\ngood financial support to the church as landowners. The frequent\r\nshifting of the tenant population creates a difficult problem for all\r\nthe social life of the community, for it is impossible for a community\r\nto assimilate a considerable percentage of its population every year and\r\nto develop those strong ties of loyalty which are essential to real\r\ncommunity life.\r\n\r\nThus a reasonable permanency of residence of its population is\r\nessential to successful community life and this is largely determined by\r\nthe economic situation of the farm business. And the importance of the\r\neffect of tenancy, or any other economic aspect of agriculture on the\r\nlife of its people must be recognized as a fundamental consideration in\r\ndetermining rural policies. Well being _on_ the land and not wealth\r\n_from_ the land is the final goal of agriculture.\r\n\r\nCommunity life is also affected by the type of farming which is\r\nprevalent among its people. Modern agriculture is becoming specialized,\r\nand the crops grown are determined both by soil and climate and by the\r\nmarkets available. Fruit sections are due primarily to the former, while\r\nthe regions producing market milk are determined chiefly by the latter\r\nfactor. Now various types of farming make distinctly different demands\r\nupon the time of the farmer and so to a considerable extent they\r\ncondition his social life. Dairying is probably the most confining sort\r\nof farming, and on the one-man farm there is little opportunity for\r\ngetting away. \"Haven't missed milking morning or night for six years,\"\r\none dairyman replied to me when asked if he ever had a vacation. The\r\nfruit grower, on the other hand, during the winter can take a few weeks\r\nto go South or visit relatives without injury to his business. In the\r\nSouth after the crops are \"laid by\" in midsummer is the season for\r\ncamp-meetings, picnics, and \"frolicking\" in general. Not only does the\r\nfruit grower have more leisure than the dairyman, but population is\r\ndenser in a fruit-growing or trucking community and hence the\r\ncommunities are smaller and more compact. Just what characteristics of\r\ncommunity life may be attributed to these differences in vocation it\r\nwould be difficult to say, for so far as I am aware no exact studies\r\nhave compared several communities of each type, but that they exercise a\r\nlarge influence on community customs and the social attitudes of the\r\npeople is patent to even a casual observer who passes from a dairy\r\nsection to a fruit region, or from the northwestern grain belt to a\r\nregion of general farming.[21]\r\n\r\nSpecialization in agricultural production also affects community life in\r\nthat its economic interests are unified both as regards production and\r\nmarketing and as the income of most of its people comes from one or two\r\nproducts, their attention is focused upon them and a greater degree of\r\nsolidarity results than where farming is more diversified and farmers\r\nare not so dependent on the sale of one or two crops. Specialization is\r\nchiefly due to advantages which it ensures in marketing, as will be\r\nindicated in the next chapter, and it is because there is less economic\r\npressure to compel general farmers to market together and that they lack\r\nthe solidarity developed by specialization, that coöperative selling\r\nassociations have not generally succeeded in a general farming region\r\nwhen they have attempted to handle various farm products.\r\n\r\nSpecialization in agriculture encourages further division of labor\r\nbecause there is a sufficient volume of work to pay for expert services.\r\nThus dairy communities have developed cow-test associations, which\r\nemploy one man to test the percent of butter-fat for each cow, to\r\ninterpret their milk production records, and sometimes to advise them\r\nwith regard to feeding. In fruit regions a considerable business is done\r\nin contract spraying. Threshing crews and threshing-rings have long been\r\ncommon. Custom plowing by tractor, and hauling of farm produce by motor\r\ntruck are becoming common. It seems probable that such division of labor\r\nwill increase as much as is practicable, but it finds very definite\r\nlimitations in the agricultural industry, due to the very short season\r\nin which many operations can be performed and which thus gives short\r\nemployment for any of the seasonal operations.\r\n\r\nDivision of labor also involves increasing the manufacture or\r\n\"processing\" of agricultural products which is an asset to the community\r\nif performed locally as far as possible. Butter is no longer made in the\r\nhome but at the creamery, and milk is prepared for the city market at\r\nthe shipping station, or is sold to a local condensary, all of which\r\nemploy more or less skilled labor. With crops which are perishable or\r\nbulky, \"processing\" must be performed locally. Thus canneries are\r\nlocated where the vegetables or fruits are grown. Although the selling\r\nof equipment for coöperative canning plants has been almost as much of a\r\nswindle as promoting coöperative creameries, yet large numbers of\r\ncoöperative creameries exist where conditions for them are suitable, and\r\nthere seems no inherent reason why coöperative canneries cannot be made\r\nsuccessful when farmers have learned how to organize and to employ\r\nexpert help.[22] In his delightful vision of the possibilities of a new\r\nIreland, entitled \"The National Being,\" George William Russell (\"A.\r\nE.\"), holds out the hope that the increase of such local coöperative\r\nmanufacture of agricultural products may be the means of furnishing an\r\nopportunity for the rural laborer to better his status.\r\n\r\n      \"But what I hope for most,\" he says, \"is first that the\r\n      natural evolution of the rural community, and the\r\n      concentration of individual manufacture, purchase, and sale\r\n      into communal enterprises, will lead to a very large\r\n      coöperative ownership of expensive machinery, which will\r\n      necessitate the communal employment of labor. If this takes\r\n      place, as I hope it will, the rural laborer, instead of\r\n      being a manual worker using primitive implements, will have\r\n      the status of a skilled mechanic employed permanently by a\r\n      coöperative community. He should be a member of the society\r\n      which employs him, and in the division of the profits\r\n      receive in proportion to his wage, as the farmers in\r\n      proportion to their trade.\"[23]\r\n\r\nTo the extent that \"processing\" farm products is taken from the farm and\r\nperformed at the community center, or that there is a division of labor,\r\nthe local community is thereby strengthened, for its life is more highly\r\norganized; it is more inter-dependent.\r\n\r\nAn interesting phase of the relation of the community to the farm\r\nbusiness is in the protection of crops and animals from insect pests and\r\ndiseases. If one man plants his wheat late enough to escape the Hessian\r\nfly his crop is benefited, but if all in a community do so the\r\nsubsequent infection is greatly reduced with consequent advantage to\r\nall. The chief obstacle preventing the successful combating of the\r\ncotton boll weevil in the South has been the difficulty of securing\r\nunited action in the necessary cultural measures for its control. Most\r\nstriking results have been secured in the eradication of the Texas Fever\r\nTick from large areas of the South, although this has been carried on\r\nusing the county as a unit; for many purposes in the South the county is\r\npractically a community. Some of the best community work in this field\r\nhas been in the West in poisoning ground squirrels and other injurious\r\nrodents and in rabbit drives. Although the poisoning campaigns are\r\nconducted over whole counties or several counties, they are organized by\r\ncommunities and their success is possible only because every one in the\r\ncommunity does his part. Whenever the farmers of a community become\r\nconvinced that they are unable to fight a pest or disease individually,\r\nbut can do so if they act collectively so that a sufficiently large area\r\nis treated as to prevent immediate re-infection, a new community bond\r\nhas been established. Whether these activities are carried on by\r\ncommunities of the exact nature previously defined (page 10) is\r\nimmaterial. The significant fact is that their people are learning how\r\nto act together in the common defense, for it was the common defense\r\nwhich first compelled mankind to live in communities, and it is defense\r\nfor one purpose or another which is ever compelling the people of a\r\nlocality to act together.\r\n\r\nFarm management experts point out the practical value to the farmer of\r\ncommunity experience with regard to methods of farm practice peculiarly\r\nadapted to local climate, soils, and markets. If one is going into\r\ndairying he can learn little from his neighbors if he locates in a fruit\r\nsection, but in a dairy section he may constantly learn from the common\r\nexperience. Dr. G. F. Warren says:\r\n\r\n      \"There is so much to learn about farming in any community\r\n      that one man cannot hope to learn it alone. The experience\r\n      of the community is of the utmost value to every farmer.\r\n      Different men try out new varieties of crops, new machines,\r\n      different breeds of animals, different methods of raising\r\n      crops, different methods of building construction, different\r\n      ways of saving labor. Each man gets the experiences of all;\r\n      if a man is following a type of farming different from his\r\n      neighbors, he cannot hope to try all these things. He is not\r\n      likely to progress very rapidly.\"[24]\r\n\r\nThese advantages occur if there be a true community; i.e., if through\r\ncommunication one may learn the experience of others, but in some cases\r\nthe experience is of little value because it is not available.\r\n\r\nFinally farmers are coming to find it profitable to establish the\r\nreputation of a community for advertising purposes. So at the railroad\r\nstation we are faced with the sign, \"Kalamazoo, the home of celery.\" We\r\nknow of \"Kalamazoo, direct to you\" stoves, but we had forgotten that it\r\nis one of the oldest and best celery-growing communities in the country.\r\nThus increased specialization gives very real advertising values to a\r\ncommunity which builds up a reputation for its products. But such a\r\nreputation is simply the recognition by the outside world of the\r\ncharacter of the community. Thus ability to advertise itself is a very\r\nreal index of its solidarity, and the desire to be able to gain\r\nadvantage from advertising may become a real motive for activities of a\r\ncommunity, as it does with many an individual. The ability to advertise\r\nbut shows the economic value of the creation of a real community.\r\n\r\nCommon interests in the farm business form the primary bond for the\r\nestablishment of true rural communities, and the strongest of these\r\ncommon interests are those involved in the problems of marketing.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] See \"The Evolution of the Country Community.\"\r\n\r\n[19] See Hamlin Garland, \"A Son of the Middle Border.\"\r\n\r\n[20] Land Tenure in the United States with special reference to\r\nIllinois, University of Illinois, \"Studies in the Social Sciences,\" Vol.\r\nV, No. 3, Sept., 1916, p. 124.\r\n\r\n[21] See John M.

These\r\nrelations involve the largest questions of the interdependence of\r\nindustries and of national and international policy in relation thereto,\r\nand we can but call attention to some of the more fundamental principles\r\ninvolved. An understanding of some of the elementary principles of\r\nagricultural economy in relation to national and international economy\r\nby the masses of our farmers, but particularly by their local leaders,\r\nis essential to any permanent progress not only of agriculture, but of\r\nindustry and commerce.\r\n\r\nBefore the time of railroads when rural communities were isolated from\r\nthe few cities situated on the seaboard and along the larger waterways,\r\nthere was little incentive for the inland farmer to raise more than he\r\nneeded for the use of his own family. As a result there was inefficient\r\nfarming and a low standard of living.[25] Railroad transportation made\r\nit possible for the farmer to send his products to the existing markets\r\nand so made it an object for him to produce a surplus, but, more\r\nimportant, it also made possible the rapid growth of numerous industrial\r\nand commercial centers and so was directly responsible for the creation\r\nof new and growing markets. Steam power, the use of coal, and the\r\neconomies of the factory system made it possible to manufacture in large\r\ncity factories many articles previously produced in the farmer's home or\r\nin the village centers. Thus a division of labor was effected which was\r\nprofitable to all parties; the growth of industrial populations gave the\r\nfarmer a market for his produce, and in turn he was able to purchase\r\nfrom the city many goods previously unknown to the farm--fertilizers,\r\nagricultural machinery, factory-made clothing, furniture, and other\r\nfactory products too numerous to mention. Furthermore, transportation\r\nand reasonably stable government made possible the growth of\r\ninternational commerce so that the markets of many staple farm products\r\nbecame practically world-wide and a division of labor arose between\r\ncertain nations. England and Germany are dependent on other countries\r\nfor a considerable part of their food supplies and raw materials, while\r\ncertain agricultural countries depend on them for manufactured goods.\r\n\r\nThe point which must ever be borne in mind in considering the relation\r\nof rural and urban communities is their interdependence; that the\r\ndevelopment both of modern industrial centers and of modern agriculture\r\nand the higher standards of living on American farms, have been due to\r\nan exchange of commodities and services which was mutually\r\nadvantageous. Without the growth of markets our farms would still be\r\nself-sufficing, but they would lack the many comforts and cultural\r\nadvantages which they now enjoy, and this rise in the farmer's standard\r\nof living has stimulated further growth of industry and so made better\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nThese considerations are particularly pertinent at the present time of\r\nagricultural and business depression. The present position of American\r\nagriculture, and its lack of buying power in our markets, has been\r\nlargely due to the fact that Europe has heretofore furnished an open\r\nmarket for our surplus agricultural products. To-day Europe is unable to\r\npurchase this surplus. The cause seems to be chiefly an economic\r\nparalysis resulting from the political interference by the tariff walls\r\nof newly-created states with the established economic relations of\r\nagricultural areas and manufacturing centers, and an unwillingness of\r\nthe farmer to do business with a currency so debased that its value is\r\nhighly problematical. So we see the great city of Vienna,[26] once one\r\nof the gayest and most brilliant capitals of Europe, now reduced to\r\ndestitution, and the cities not only of Russia but of Germany being\r\nforced to revert to the ancient system of barter in order to secure\r\nadequate food.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate dependence of all cities upon the farms and mines is to-day\r\nexemplified in Europe with such appalling tragedy, that even the smug\r\nisolation of the American farmer and the American business man is broken\r\ndown, not only by human sympathy but by the necessity of a better\r\nadjustment of their own economic system to the world crisis from which\r\nthey are unable to escape.\r\n\r\nThis shift of control from the city to the country has been powerfully\r\nportrayed by Norman Angell:\r\n\r\n      \"Moreover, the problem (of feeding Great Britain) is\r\n      affected by what is perhaps the most important economic\r\n      change in the world since the industrial revolution, namely\r\n      the alteration in the ratio of the exchange value of\r\n      manufacture and food--the shift over of advantage in\r\n      exchange from the side of the industrialist and manufacturer\r\n      to the side of the producer of food.\"[27]\r\n\r\n      \"Before the War the towns of Europe were the luxurious and\r\n      opulent centers; the rural districts were comparatively\r\n      poor. To-day it is the cities of the continent that are\r\n      half-starved or famine-stricken, while the farms are\r\n      well-fed and relatively opulent. In Russia, Poland, Hungary,\r\n      Germany, Austria; the cities perish but the peasants for the\r\n      most part have a sufficiency. The cities are finding that\r\n      with the breakdown of the old stability--of the transport\r\n      and credit systems particularly--they cannot obtain food\r\n      from the farmers. This process which we now see at work on\r\n      the continent is in fact the reverse of our historical\r\n      development.\"[28]\r\n\r\nBut although the farmer may have sufficient food for the time--though in\r\nRussia millions are starving, due in considerable measure to the\r\neconomic and political chaos of the nation--yet if this reverse process\r\nshould go on, rural civilization would be reduced to that of former\r\ngenerations, and its advance would be possible only when the industries\r\nwhich furnish its material basis were revived and confidence in the\r\nmedium of exchange were again established. The city owes its existence\r\nto the farm, but without the city the farm would go back to the hoe and\r\nthe sickle and the \"age of homespun.\"\r\n\r\nI am not seeking to justify the modern city, for its economic and social\r\nweaknesses are ever increasingly apparent, but it is important that we\r\nfully realize the fact that rural progress has been chiefly due to the\r\ngoods and services received in exchange from urban markets. We have\r\nalready noted the tendency toward specialization in agriculture and its\r\neffect on the rural community, and that specialization has been chiefly\r\ndue to markets. One of the chief factors in encouraging specialization\r\nin the growth of certain products by whole communities and sections is\r\nthe fact that a larger volume of a given product ensures better\r\nmarketing facilities and a better price to the producer as long as the\r\nsupply is not in excess of the demand. Where there is a considerable\r\nvolume of a certain product, buyers can meet their demands more easily\r\nand are attracted to it, whereas a small lot of howsoever good a product\r\nmust seek a buyer. Freight rates are reduced, damage in transit is\r\nreduced, and better transportation is secured in carload and trainload\r\nthan in small shipments. The middleman's charges are less if he is\r\nassured a considerable volume of business. Thus specialization makes\r\npossible a more effective system of marketing than is possible with\r\nindiscriminate production.\r\n\r\nNot only must there be sufficient volume of a given product, but it must\r\nbe so standardized with regard to varieties, grade and quantities or\r\npackages that the reputation of the goods may be established in the\r\nmarket. In order to secure uniformity it has been found necessary to\r\nstandardize varieties and to grow a few well-known varieties of a given\r\nproduct which are best adapted to local conditions and to the market,\r\nrather than a number of varieties, as might be feasible if they were all\r\nsold directly on the local market.\r\n\r\nUniformity of grading and packing is also essential to establish a\r\nreputation on the market. A concern like the California Fruit Growers'\r\nExchange cannot afford to spend half a million dollars a year in\r\nadvertising unless it knows that its product will be as advertised, for\r\nadvertising an unreliable product may secure temporary sales, but will\r\nhardly be a profitable investment, for the value of advertising an\r\nhonest product is cumulative. To secure necessary uniformity of grading\r\nand packing it has been found necessary with almost all agricultural\r\nproducts to have the grading and packing done at a central establishment\r\nrather than on the farm. For even assuming the honesty and good intent\r\nof the farmer, the standards and skill of different farmers will vary to\r\nsuch an extent that uniformity is impossible. Uniformity of grade and\r\npackage must be secured at some stage of the process of marketing before\r\nthe goods are bought by the retailer. Until recently much of this\r\nservice has been performed by the commission men at the central markets,\r\nwho have taken what was shipped to them or what their agents purchased\r\nand graded it to meet the demands of the trade, and who, of course, had\r\nto charge for their services. It has been found more profitable with\r\nmost products to have the grading and packing done as near to the farm\r\nas is possible to secure a sufficient volume of business for the\r\nenterprise. Thus we have local packing houses for fruits, potatoes,\r\npoultry products, grain elevators, etc., usually located at the point of\r\nprimary shipment. These local plants, as well as local creameries,\r\ncanneries, and other agricultural factories and storage plants, become\r\ncommunity institutions as they meet the needs of the farmers within the\r\nareas tributary to the centers where they are located. It is true, of\r\ncourse, that many of these plants are located in the open country or at\r\nmere railroad stations, and that many of them draw their patronage from\r\nseveral communities; yet more commonly than otherwise they are located\r\nat village centers and serve the areas tributary to them. With the\r\nadvent of good roads and motor trucks, the areas served by such\r\nestablishments will tend to become larger, but there are many local\r\ncircumstances which will tend to limit the process of centralization.\r\nWhether these plants are operated by private individuals, by stock\r\ncompanies, or by coöperative associations of the producers, they are\r\nessential to an effective marketing system and may greatly strengthen\r\ncommunity life. If, however, there be two or three elevators in a little\r\nvillage, each operated for profit by a private owner, where all the\r\nbusiness could be more economically handled by one concern and where the\r\ncompetition creates friction and suspicion, then like the rivalry\r\nbetween an excessive number of churches, they tend to divide the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nStudents of marketing problems seem agreed that better marketing systems\r\nwill benefit the farmer through greater efficiency which will reduce the\r\ncosts of the process rather than through greater profits from higher\r\nprices, and that in many lines the largest improvement is possible in\r\nthe grading, packing, and shipping from the local station. This being\r\nthe case, it seems obvious that the solution of the marketing problem\r\nwill increasingly depend upon community action.\r\n\r\nBetter transportation and storage facilities tend to stabilize prices\r\nover large areas and to give the larger markets increasing advantage in\r\nbargaining for the farmer's products. Not that there is any concerted\r\naction upon the part of the buyers to take an undue advantage of the\r\nfarmer, for there is usually keen competition between them, but\r\ninevitably the \"centralization\" of the buying power of the larger\r\nmarkets makes it possible for them to very largely determine the price,\r\njust as the large employers of labor can to a considerable extent\r\ndetermine the wages they will pay if labor is unorganized; for whenever\r\nthere is a surplus the individual farmer must sell, while the buyer can,\r\nwithin limits, purchase where or from whom he chooses. Thus for the same\r\nreason that labor is forced to organize trade unions to maintain its\r\nwages and working conditions, farmers are forced to organize to market\r\ntheir products together and to bargain collectively for their price.\r\nThis is the outstanding agricultural movement of the past decade and at\r\nthe present time is so successfully challenging the established system\r\nof marketing as to command national attention. The success of such a\r\nmovement depends primarily upon the solidarity and efficiency of the\r\nlocal units, so that collective bargaining requires the organization of\r\nthe agricultural community into selling associations for its various\r\nproducts. The whole process encourages the economic organization of the\r\nrural community and heightens community consciousness through the effort\r\nof its members to defend their common economic interests.\r\n\r\nThe method of collective selling may vary, but in practice the\r\ncoöperative selling association has proven the most satisfactory and\r\nwill be discussed in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nWhen the most successful farmers on the best land in Illinois lose\r\ntwenty-five cents on every bushel of corn they raised, as was the case\r\nin 1921, and when it is easier for isolated farmers in Kansas to burn\r\ncorn than to buy coal at the prices current, while at the same time\r\nmillions of innocent women and children are starving in Europe, it seems\r\nevident that the complex system of marketing upon which modern industry\r\nand civilization has depended, is pretty well out of gear and that\r\nnational and international questions must be wisely solved before it can\r\nagain function. Yet in last analysis the solution of the complex\r\nproblems of marketing rests not alone with international treaties, but\r\nwith the farmers' selling associations of the rural communities. If we\r\nare to have a marketing system which is truly functional, which is built\r\non the principle of the greatest service at the lowest cost, rather than\r\non the principle now implicit in business of sufficient service to\r\nsecure the maximum of profit which the traffic will bear, then it must\r\nbe a coöperative system, the primary unit of which is the local\r\ncoöperative association, whose success depends upon the loyalty of its\r\nmembers to the coöperative principle. So coöperation is a community\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nNor can we expect marked progress in other phases of rural life as long\r\nas the economic question is acute. It is not true that economic\r\nprosperity in agriculture will of itself ensure the higher culture of\r\nthe countryside; but it is true that so long as the farmer is compelled\r\nto devote all of his strength and time to making a competence for his\r\nfamily, that his attention must necessarily be fixed on economic ends\r\nand that he will have neither the means nor the time for those\r\nsatisfactions of life which are possible to one with some leisure. Says\r\n\"A.E.\": \"I believe the fading hold the heavens have over the world is\r\ndue to the neglect of the economic basis of spiritual life. What\r\nprofound spiritual life can there be when the social order almost forces\r\nmen to battle with each other for the means of existence?\"[29] For weal\r\nor woe the material existence of both farmer and townman throughout the\r\ncivilized world is inextricably inter-dependent. If a better economic\r\nsystem is to arise it must come through the general understanding of\r\nthese relations by the education of all parties and by a willingness to\r\nfind satisfaction in the well-being of all rather than in the largest\r\nindividual profit. Unless these attitudes can be established in the\r\nlocal community, how can we expect to secure harmony of interests among\r\nlarger groups? Loyalty to the common good must first be developed in the\r\nlocal community among neighbors.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent chapters we shall have occasion to consider various forces\r\nand methods for creating this spirit of community, and we shall see that\r\nwhereas the higher culture of rural life awaits a better economic\r\nsystem, this spirit of loyalty which is essential for coöperative\r\norganizations may be developed through various forms of community\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] See Percy Wells Bidwell, \"Rural Economy in New England at the\r\nBeginning of the Nineteenth Century.\" Trans.

We have indicated that willingness to work together for the\r\ncommon good and loyalty to this principle are essential for successful\r\ncoöperative enterprises. As these same attitudes are the basis of\r\ncommunity life, it seems obvious that to the extent that membership in\r\ncoöperative associations becomes general throughout a community, the\r\nstronger will be the community life. Indeed, the very etymology of the\r\ntwo words, _coöperate_--to work together, and _community_--having in\r\ncommon, indicate that community activities are essentially a form of\r\ncoöperation--of working together. Inasmuch as coöperative enterprises\r\nare rapidly increasing and that they must, therefore, exercise a\r\npowerful influence upon community life, it is necessary to gain a clear\r\nidea of just what is involved in the principle of coöperation and to\r\nwhat types of organization the term is applicable.\r\n\r\nIn a general way there has always been a certain amount of coöperation\r\nbetween neighboring farmers in the exchange of work in barn-raisings,\r\nthreshing, silo-filling, slaughtering, etc. Out of this have grown such\r\ncoöperative organizations as threshing rings, and groups for the common\r\nownership and use of all sorts of more expensive machinery, the\r\ncoöperative ownership of sires, cow-test associations, and many other\r\nforms of organization for mutual aid in farm operations. All of these\r\nare coöperative associations in the common usage of the word\r\ncoöperation, but in recent years the term has come to have a more\r\ntechnical meaning to denote a form of organization in contrast to the\r\ncorporation or stock company, which has been the most prevalent type of\r\nbusiness organization in recent years.\r\n\r\nThe coöperative association differs from the corporation or stock\r\ncompany in three essentials. First, it is democratic in its control; all\r\ntrue coöperative organizations employ the principle of \"one man, one\r\nvote,\" the influence of each member of the association being equal as\r\nfar as the legal control of its administration is concerned. The\r\nindividual members and not the amount of stock owned controls the policy\r\nof the association. Coöperation is democracy applied to business.\r\nSecond, the coöperative association is organized to secure more\r\nefficient service rather than to exact profits. This is a point upon\r\nwhich there is much misunderstanding upon the part of those starting\r\ncoöperative enterprises and which requires further explanation. Third,\r\nthe earnings or savings of the association (commonly thought of as\r\n\"profits\") are distributed among the members or patrons of the\r\nassociation _pro rata_ according to the volume of the business which\r\nthey have transacted with the association, so that although its control\r\nis democratic its benefits accrue according to the amount of financial\r\ninterest involved. There are certain other principles of business\r\nprocedure which have been found essential to the successful operation of\r\ndifferent kinds of coöperative associations, but these three--individual\r\nvoting, service rather than profits, and pro-rating the earnings--are\r\nfundamental to all truly coöperative associations, and it is to this\r\ncombination of business methods to which the term coöperation has now\r\ncome to be applied in a technical sense.\r\n\r\nExclusive of associations formed for coöperation in the general sense of\r\nthe term, i.e., for various purposes of farm operation as mentioned\r\nabove, farmers' coöperative associations may be divided into three\r\ngeneral groups: for buying, for selling, and for finance.\r\n\r\nCoöperative buying has been most successfully developed by industrial\r\nworkers in towns and cities and is commonly known as \"consumers'\r\ncoöperation.\" Starting with a few poverty-stricken workers who pooled\r\ntheir meager savings so that they could buy at wholesale and share in\r\nthe profits of the retailer, the Rochdale system has grown until the\r\nwholesale coöperative societies of England and Scotland are probably the\r\nlargest general merchandising corporations in the world, doing a\r\nbusiness of approximately a billion dollars a year.\r\n\r\nCoöperative buying of farm supplies, fertilizers, machinery, spraying\r\nmaterials, feeds, binder twine, etc., is one of the first forms of\r\ncoöperative effort ordinarily undertaken by farmers' associations, and\r\nis carried on by numerous methods. In most cases the services rendered\r\nin the business management of such buying is at first largely on a\r\nvoluntary basis or is but poorly paid. Only in a few sections of the\r\ncountry has the coöperative buying of agricultural supplies assumed a\r\npermanent or stable form of organization, and in those cases it is very\r\nfrequently a department of a coöperative selling association, such as a\r\nfruit exchange. From an educational standpoint there is much to be said\r\nfor commencing coöperation through organization for buying agricultural\r\nsupplies, for through it farmers are trained in the principles of\r\ncoöperation with the greatest possibility of advantage and the least\r\nrisk of loss. There is little probability of loss in judicious\r\ncoöperative purchases of carload lots with orders in hand, while in\r\ncoöperative selling, unless marketing facilities are so bad as to force\r\nhim to take the risk, the chance of loss is a serious consideration to\r\nthe farmer. This point has been well stated by Edwin A. Pratt, a leader\r\nof agricultural organization in England, who says:\r\n\r\n      \"Inquiry into the conditions under which organization of\r\n      agriculture has been successfully carried out in other\r\n      countries showed that a beginning had invariably been made\r\n      with the simplest form of combination for the joint purchase\r\n      of agricultural necessaries. In this way the advantages of\r\n      coöperation could be brought home to cultivators, who were\r\n      gradually educated in the theory and practice of combination\r\n      without having their suspicions aroused and their mutual\r\n      distrust stimulated by proposals that they should at once\r\n      alter their old conditions of trading in accordance with\r\n      that system of combination for transport or sale which\r\n      really constitutes not the beginning of agricultural\r\n      organization, but one of the most difficult and most\r\n      complicated of all its many phases.\"[30]\r\n\r\nOne of the allurements of coöperative buying has been to at once\r\nestablish a coöperative store for a general merchandising business. The\r\nhistory of such stores started by granges in the 70's and 80's is\r\ninstructive in this connection. A few of them survive, but most of them\r\nwere failures. Only after years of experience and education in\r\ncoöperative purchasing and other coöperative enterprises have the aims\r\nand methods of operating coöperative stores been sufficiently\r\nappreciated by most rural communities to ensure their successful\r\nestablishment. We have already considered (page 48) some of the\r\nconsiderations which should govern the attempt to compete with local\r\nmerchants. Generally the successful operation of a coöperative store is\r\nmore difficult for an average group of farmers to manage than the\r\nsimpler forms of coöperative purchasing, or coöperative credit or\r\nselling associations.[31] Moreover, a coöperative store will seriously\r\naffect the solidarity of a small community unless a goodly majority,\r\nboth from farm and village, are convinced of the necessity of competing\r\nwith local retailers and will give the store their patronage. Except in\r\nthe buying of agricultural supplies, which may be considered rather as\r\nthe raw materials and equipment of the farm as a manufacturing business\r\nand which are therefore entitled to wholesale prices, consumers'\r\ncoöperation as usually conducted through coöperative stores is not a\r\ndistinctively agricultural problem, but is the same for the farmer as\r\nfor the villager or industrial worker, and its desirability and\r\nlimitations are determined by similar considerations.\r\n\r\nWith the change to a commercial type of farming and with the higher\r\nprice of land, the American farmer has had to make larger use of\r\nborrowed capital and his business has been seriously hampered by a lack\r\nof credit facilities to meet his needs. Probably in no field of\r\ncoöperative effort have the benefits been more apparent than in that of\r\nthe rural credit banks which are found throughout Europe and which have\r\nthoroughly demonstrated their usefulness. Attention has been called to\r\nthe fact that our best farm lands are more and more operated by tenants,\r\nand that this is inimical to strong community life. One of the reasons\r\nfor this tendency has been the inability to secure long-term loans on\r\nfarm real estate by the man who has little capital of his own. As lands\r\nrose in value this became increasingly difficult. To meet this\r\nsituation a commission representative of all sections of the United\r\nStates visited various countries in Europe in the spring of 1913, and as\r\na result of their report, in 1916 Congress finally enacted the Federal\r\nFarm Loan Act establishing a system of farm land banks. Under this\r\nsystem one-half of the value of a farm and buildings up to $10,000 may\r\nbe borrowed and paid off under the amortization plan in from five to\r\nforty years at a low rate of interest. The details of the system do not\r\nconcern our present discussion, but the essential feature of the system\r\nis the local land bank through which the loans are made and collected.\r\nThe local land bank is strictly a coöperative society organized to\r\nsecure long-term credit facilities for its members under the terms of\r\nthe federal act through the regional land banks of which each local bank\r\nis a member. Like other coöperative associations, the area in which the\r\nlocal bank does business is not necessarily that of a community, it may\r\nbe a whole county where there are but few members, or there may be more\r\nthan one bank in a single community, but more commonly it is located at\r\na village center and tends to become a community institution.\r\n\r\nEqually important for financing the current expenses of farming\r\noperations and to make possible the orderly marketing of crops, is the\r\nfarmer's need for short-time credit. Our banking system has been\r\ndeveloped to meet the needs of the business world, and the period for\r\nwhich loans can be made is too short to meet the needs of the farmer,\r\nwho often requires credit for six months to a year. In some ten states\r\nlegislation has been passed authorizing the formation of local credit\r\nassociations, which are really local coöperative banks, but the number\r\nof credit associations established in rural communities has been\r\ninsignificant, thirty-three out of a total of thirty-six being in North\r\nCarolina.[32] The tremendous losses suffered by American farmers during\r\n1921 and their inability to secure sufficient credit from their local\r\nbanks has shown the necessity for better short-time credit facilities,\r\nand bills are now before Congress which will enable the local land banks\r\nto also handle short-time loans in coöperation with the Federal Reserve\r\nBanks. If this is done, the amount of business done by these local banks\r\nwill be greatly increased and the coöperative principle in banking will\r\nbe greatly strengthened.\r\n\r\nCoöperative selling associations have had a rapid growth in the United\r\nStates during the past decade. In 1919 the federal Bureau of Markets\r\nestimated that agricultural products worth one and a half billions out\r\nof a total of nearly nineteen billion dollars sold from farms were\r\nmarketed through coöperative associations, and the total has greatly\r\nincreased since then. The California Fruit Growers' Exchange, probably\r\nthe largest coöperative selling association, does a business of over\r\n$50,000,000 annually and has one of the most efficient distributing\r\nsystems in the country.\r\n\r\nAt the present time some very ambitious programs of national\r\norganizations for coöperative marketing are being started, such as the\r\nUnited States Grain Growers, Inc., which is modeled after the successful\r\nCanadian Grain Growers, Inc. One of the chief obstacles to all such\r\nplans of effectively organizing the marketing of various agricultural\r\nproducts is the fact that a strong central organization can be developed\r\nonly by the federation of local associations whose members understand\r\nthe purposes of the organization and are loyal to them. The history of\r\nall coöperative movements shows that those which have been permanently\r\nsuccessful have arisen through the federation of strong local\r\nassociations, and numerous failures of well-intentioned efforts at\r\nlarge-scale coöperative marketing have been due to the fact that\r\nnumerous local associations cannot be organized by the parent\r\nassociation with any assurance that they will function effectively.\r\n\r\nThe late G. Harold Powell, for many years the successful manager of the\r\nCalifornia Fruit Growers' Exchange, in his discussion of the\r\nfundamentals of coöperation emphasizes that coöperative associations\r\nmust be born of a real need:\r\n\r\n      \"Among farmers, who under existing conditions are already\r\n      prosperous, the need of business organization is not usually\r\n      felt, even though the costs of marketing and extravagant\r\n      profits of the middlemen or the railroads might be greatly\r\n      reduced. They must feel the pressure of need before they can\r\n      launch a successful business association. When the farmers\r\n      buy their supplies at reasonable prices, and sell their\r\n      products readily at a good profit, they do not feel the\r\n      necessity of organization. It has been the experience of the\r\n      past that they must feel the need of getting together to\r\n      meet a crisis in their affairs, and the realization of the\r\n      need must spring from within and not be forced upon them\r\n      from without by the enthusiasm of some opportunist who seeks\r\n      to unite the farmers on the principle that organization is a\r\n      good thing.... In short, if an organization is to be\r\n      successful, the investment of the farmer must be threatened\r\n      by existing social and economic conditions before he can\r\n      overcome his individualism sufficiently and can develop a\r\n      fraternal spirit strong enough to pull with his neighbors in\r\n      coöperative team work.\"[33]\r\n\r\nThe tremendous losses suffered by American agriculture in 1921 furnish\r\nexactly such a crisis as Mr. Powell suggests, and have given the\r\nstrongest impetus to the coöperative movement. But even when the\r\nnecessity exists and is recognized it takes time to build up a strong\r\ncoöperative association.\r\n\r\nThe successful operation of a local coöperative association is a matter\r\nof slow growth, because it requires the education of the membership in\r\nthe principles both of coöperation and of marketing, and what is equally\r\nessential, the development of a willingness to sometimes forego the\r\nadvantage of larger profits by individual members in order to ensure the\r\npermanent success of the association. The local association has to learn\r\nhow to conduct its business just as does the individual business man,\r\nand it has to compete with individuals and firms who are in business for\r\nprofit and who have the advantage of experience in the existing\r\nmarketing system and the financial backing of its business connections.\r\nIn the attempt to create local selling associations rapidly so as to\r\nsecure a sufficient volume of business to ensure the success of large\r\nmarketing enterprises, there is always a tendency to encourage the local\r\nmembers to believe that they will secure a considerably larger share of\r\nthe consumer's dollar, and when prices are not materially better than\r\nunder the old system they readily become dissatisfied and withdraw. The\r\nbest authorities and advocates of coöperative marketing insist that it\r\nwill be successful only to the degree that it can become more efficient\r\nthan the existing system and so effect savings and make legitimate\r\nearnings, but that there is little prospect for large \"profits\"; indeed,\r\nthat the legitimate objective of coöperation is not profits, but\r\nsavings. Professor Macklin summarizes the matter as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"The true coöperative organization seeks to establish and\r\n      maintain a distributing system to provide adequately and\r\n      dependably at minimum cost the essential marketing services\r\n      of which the industry and its individual members have\r\n      constant and vital need. Its justification lies in rendering\r\n      these services at a lower cost and in bringing to farmers a\r\n      higher proportion of the consumer's dollar.\"[34]\r\n\r\nWith the factors involved in successful coöperative selling associations\r\nwe are not here concerned, except to insist upon the point that as the\r\nweakest link measures the strength of a chain, so the strength of the\r\nlocal association determines the strength or weakness of the central\r\nselling association. A joint stock company may afford more efficient\r\nmanagement than a coöperative association, and unless the local\r\nmembership is convinced of the superior equity and ultimate advantages\r\nof a strong coöperative system, there is little hope for the coöperative\r\nto compete with the stock company. Coöperation means working together,\r\nand its emphasis is more on duties and obligations than on rights and\r\npersonal advantage. In coöperative enterprises the individual must be\r\nconvinced that his best interest in the long run is bound up with the\r\nbest interest of the whole membership, and unless he is sometimes\r\nwilling to forego immediate personal advantage and unless he can learn\r\nhow to work with others, sometimes without compensation or with less\r\nthan he could secure otherwise, there is little chance for developing a\r\nstrong organization. For coöperation is but democracy applied to certain\r\nphases of business, and, like democracy in politics or any other sphere\r\nof life, its highest sanction lies in belief and satisfaction in the\r\ncollective well-being.\r\n\r\nIt seems obvious, therefore, that those attitudes which are essential\r\nfor coöperation are the same which encourage community life, and that\r\nwhere the coöperative spirit dominates, community activities will be\r\nstrengthened. Whereas, on the contrary, in those localities where\r\nfamily, political, or personal feuds, jealousies and suspicions are\r\nrife, coöperative enterprises will be difficult and the community will\r\nbe weak.\r\n\r\nThat coöperation does develop those qualities which make for better\r\ncommunities is attested by all who have observed its effects. As a\r\nresult of his long experience Sir Horace Plunkett says:\r\n\r\n      \"It is here, in furnishing opportunity for the exercise of\r\n      education secured from the agricultural colleges, that the\r\n      educational value of coöperative societies comes in; they\r\n      act as agencies through which scientific teaching may become\r\n      actual practice, not in the uncertain future, but in the\r\n      living present. A coöperative association has a quality\r\n      which should commend it to the social reformer--the power of\r\n      evoking character; it brings to the front a new type of\r\n      local leader, not the best talker, but the man whose\r\n      knowledge enables him to make some solid contribution to the\r\n      welfare of the community.\"[35]\r\n\r\nSo, likewise, a keen observer of Danish coöperation describes its\r\ninfluence in creating scientific and social attitudes:\r\n\r\n      \"Among the indirect, but equally tangible results of\r\n      coöperation, I should be inclined to put the development of\r\n      mind and character among those by whom it is practised. The\r\n      peasant or little farmer, who is a member of one or more of\r\n      these societies, who helps to build up their success and\r\n      enjoy their benefits, acquires a new outlook. The jealousies\r\n      and suspicions which are in most countries so common among\r\n      those who live by the land fall from him. Feeling that he\r\n      has a voice in great affairs he acquires an added value and\r\n      a healthy importance in his own eyes. He knows also that in\r\n      his degree and according to his output he is on an equal\r\n      footing with the largest producer and proportionately is\r\n      doing as well. There is no longer any fear that because he\r\n      is a little man he will be browbeaten or forced to accept a\r\n      worse price for what he has to sell than does his rich and\r\n      powerful neighbor. The skilled minds which direct his\r\n      business work as zealously for him as for that important\r\n      neighbor.\"[36]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the three highest authorities on the\r\ncoöperative movement in Ireland all lay great stress on its importance\r\nas a means of community organization and value its social effects as\r\nhighly as its economic benefits. Thus Sir Horace Plunkett says:\r\n\r\n      \"Gradually the (coöperative) Society becomes the most\r\n      important institution in the district, the most important in\r\n      a social as well as an economic sense. The members feel a\r\n      pride in its material expansion. They accumulate large\r\n      profits, which in time become a sort of communal fund. In\r\n      some cases this is used for the erection of village halls\r\n      where social entertainments, concerts and dances are held,\r\n      lectures delivered and libraries stored. Finally, the\r\n      association assumes the character of a rural commune, where,\r\n      instead of the old basis of the commune, the joint ownership\r\n      of land, a new basis for union is found in the voluntary\r\n      communism of effort.\"[37]\r\n\r\nIn the same vein Smith-Gordon and Staples in their account of the\r\ncoöperative movement in Ireland, see it as the most important force for\r\nsocialization because it makes the most immediate and practical appeal\r\nto men of all parties and sects and establishes a business system which\r\ndevelops the community attitude:\r\n\r\n      \"The present individualist system which takes care of the\r\n      business interests of the farmer is a dividing and\r\n      disintegrating force. It tends to destroy the natural\r\n      associative character and to set each man against his\r\n      neighbor.... But as a member of a society with interests in\r\n      common with others, the individual consciously and\r\n      unconsciously develops the social virtues.... The society is\r\n      in miniature a community, and the community is but a part of\r\n      the larger social group.\"[38]\r\n\r\nGeorge William Russell (\"A.E.\"), the poet-prophet of Irish agriculture,\r\nbases his whole conception of a desirable polity for the Irish State\r\nupon coöperative communities, and considers coöperative societies as a\r\nprerequisite to rural organization. After describing the marked economic\r\nand social changes which have taken place in a typical Irish community\r\nas the result of coöperation, he says:\r\n\r\n      \"I have tried to indicate the difference between a rural\r\n      population and a rural community, between a people loosely\r\n      knit together by the vague ties of a common latitude and\r\n      longitude, and people who are closely knit together in an\r\n      association and who form a true social organism, a true\r\n      rural community, where the general will can find expression\r\n      and society is malleable to the general will. I will assert\r\n      that there never can be any progress in rural districts or\r\n      any real prosperity without such farmers' organizations or\r\n      guilds. Wherever rural prosperity is reported in any country\r\n      inquire into it, and it will be found that it depends on\r\n      rural organization. Wherever there is rural decay, if it is\r\n      inquired into, it will be found that there was a rural\r\n      population but no rural community, no organization, no guild\r\n      to promote common interests and unite the countrymen in\r\n      defence of them.\"[39]\r\n\r\nThe same observations might be made upon the effect of coöperative\r\nenterprises in solidifying rural communities in the United States. It\r\nseems doubtful whether coöperative associations in the United States\r\nwill develop a general social program as they have done in Ireland,\r\nBelgium, and Russia. On account of a different social inheritance and\r\naccount of our facility in forming and belonging to numerous\r\norganizations, it seems probable that we will limit our coöperative\r\nsocieties to strictly economic functions, and will use the increased\r\nincome secured through them in other organizations for social purposes.\r\n\r\nCommercial farming is breaking down the old individualism of the farmer,\r\nfor the exigencies of the economic situation are forcing him to market\r\ncollectively through coöperative selling associations, and as he learns\r\nthat his own best interests are bound up with those of the whole\r\ncommunity, he becomes increasingly concerned for the common welfare; he\r\ncommences to think in terms of \"us\" and \"ours,\" instead of only \"me\" and\r\n\"mine.\" The community becomes a reality to him.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[30] \"Agricultural Organization,\" p. 99.

In colonial\r\ntimes public schools were largely confined to New England. With the\r\nsettlement of the Middle West district schools were established with the\r\naid of the government land grants. But in the South conditions were not\r\nfavorable for public schools until long after the Civil War, and only in\r\nthe last generation or two has public education become firmly\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThe district school, the famous \"little red school-house\" of the\r\nnineteenth century, was frequently the neighborhood center and the\r\nschool district commonly formed a neighborhood area, particularly in\r\nhilly sections where its lines were adjusted by topography. A recent\r\nstudy of neighborhood areas in Otsego County, New York, shows that about\r\nhalf of them are identical with the school districts, chiefly on account\r\nof topography, while in Dane County, Wisconsin, more neighborhood areas\r\nare determined primarily by the school district than by any one\r\nfactor.[40] Formerly the district school-house was quite frequently\r\nused for Sunday school or preaching services; spelling-bees and other\r\nentertainments were held from time to time; and political meetings and\r\nelections were commonly held there.\r\n\r\nAlthough the district school is still a neighborhood social center in\r\nmany sections, its decadence commenced at the close of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, the change depending upon the general progress or isolation of\r\nthe community, particularly as affected by transportation. Several\r\nfactors have combined to make the district school unsatisfactory to the\r\nrural community of to-day. In the older parts of the country the\r\npopulation has so decreased that in many districts the maintenance of a\r\nschool has become exceedingly expensive, it is difficult to secure\r\ncompetent teachers, and there are too few pupils to make the school\r\nattractive. The better educational advantages of town and city schools\r\nhave caused much dissatisfaction upon the part of the better class of\r\nfarmers who wish their children to have the best possible start in life,\r\nand many of those who can afford to do so have \"moved to town\" to\r\neducate their children, thus making a bad matter worse for the district\r\nschool. As long as roads were poor the district school was the only one\r\npossible, but with better roads, automobiles and trolleys, the\r\nconsolidation of schools has proceeded rapidly in the past decade,\r\nparticularly in the prairie states.\r\n\r\nA modern school cannot be maintained at every other crossroads. Improved\r\nroads naturally radiate from the village center and hence it is the\r\nlogical point for a consolidated school or high school. There are\r\nlocalities in isolated regions where it might be desirable to establish\r\nconsolidated schools in the open country, but in most cases where there\r\nis a natural village center, the school should be located there and the\r\nschool laws should make possible the organization of the consolidated\r\nschool district regardless of township or county lines. Indeed\r\nlegislation has already been enacted to this end in several states and\r\nforms one of the most important movements for strengthening the rural\r\ncommunity. Here and there are to be found consolidated schools which\r\nhave been placed in the open country at the center of a township because\r\nit was the point most easily agreed upon by all the patrons,\r\nparticularly where the township is an administrative unit of the school\r\nsystem. In some cases somewhat successful efforts are being made to have\r\nsuch consolidated schools serve as social centers, but it is believed\r\nthat in the long run community life will flow to its natural centers and\r\nthat the seeming success of such social centers in the open country,\r\nunless the neighborhood be an isolated one, will tend to weaken the\r\ncommunities concerned. Usually a consolidated district of this sort will\r\ncontain parts of two or three community areas and the location of the\r\nschool at a point between them weakens the support of the community\r\ncenters to that extent. Here we encounter one of the many ways in which\r\nour artificial unit of rural government--the township--interferes with\r\ncommunity progress.[41]\r\n\r\nFormerly only the children of the upper classes who were preparing for\r\ncollege received a secondary education, but during the past generation\r\nthere has been a rapid growth of public high schools which serve as the\r\n\"people's colleges.\" At first these were found only in the cities and\r\nlarger towns, but rural communities have demanded equal advantages and\r\nstate and national legislation has aided them in the cost of\r\nmaintenance. Federal aid for secondary education in vocational subjects,\r\nnow available through the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917, has encouraged the\r\nestablishment of rural high schools and has greatly increased the number\r\ngiving instruction in agriculture and home economics. Hundreds of rural\r\nhigh schools are now giving agricultural courses better than the\r\nagricultural colleges gave twenty-five years ago.\r\n\r\nRural high schools with full four-year courses have been found mostly in\r\nthe larger villages and towns, but the movement is now well under way to\r\ndivide the period of secondary education into a junior and senior high\r\nschool (the so-called \"six-six\" plan), and junior high schools,\r\nincluding the seventh to ninth grades, are being established in many\r\nsmaller communities by simply adding a grade to the consolidated\r\nschools. The educational forces of the country, as expressed by\r\nstatements of the U. S. Bureau of Education and the National Education\r\nAssociation, are now committed to the policy of consolidated rural\r\nschools wherever they are practicable and to the establishment of a\r\nsufficient number of high schools so that every rural child may attend\r\nhigh school and still be able to live at home. Obviously it is important\r\nfrom the standpoint of community development that the high schools\r\nshould be placed at community centers and that where some of the\r\ncommunities are too small to support senior high schools that they\r\nshould be located at a village which serves as a center of what, for\r\nwant of a better term, we may call \"the larger community\" (see pages\r\n232-3).\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons for consolidated schools is that the objectives of\r\nrural education are changing and that country people are demanding that\r\ntheir children be educated for country as well as for town life.\r\nFormerly the content and method of rural education was an imitation of\r\nthat of the city and inevitably made industrial, commercial, and\r\nprofessional occupations the ideal of the pupil. The schools of New\r\nEngland have done an immense service to the rest of the country but they\r\nwere an important factor in depopulating many a New England town. The\r\nintroduction of nature study, agriculture, and home economics is\r\nbecoming general in rural schools. Educators do not desire to train\r\nrural children solely for farm life, and thus to segregate a farm class,\r\neven were that possible, but they are attempting to give equal emphasis\r\nto the values of country life so that it may prove equally attractive to\r\nthe best as well as to the less efficient rural youth.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the whole attitude of rural as well as urban education is\r\nchanging from that of teaching individuals so as to equip them with\r\nintellectual tools for their personal advancement, to one of training\r\nfuture citizens who will attain their own best interests by useful\r\nservice to the community. The curriculum and objectives of the school\r\nare rapidly becoming socialized, and as this process goes on the school\r\nwill more and more become the most important single institution for\r\ncreating community loyalty.\r\n\r\nThe community school, particularly the high school, no longer confines\r\nitself to the instruction of its regular pupils; it is the educational\r\ncenter and headquarters of the community. With the assistance of the\r\nExtension Service of the agricultural colleges, rural high schools are\r\nholding one-week extension schools for farm men and women, and under the\r\nSmith-Hughes Act they are offering continuation short courses for the\r\nyounger farmers. The progressive rural high school is taking a live\r\ninterest in the one-room district schools which may be too far from the\r\ncenter for consolidation, and is seeking to interest their pupils in\r\nattending high schools through athletic meets, play festivals, and\r\nsimilar assemblages of all the schools of the community, which thus\r\ncreate a natural bond of interest and common enthusiasm. The principal\r\nof the high school at Oxford, N. Y., recently organized a\r\npublic-speaking contest of representatives of all the country schools in\r\nhis supervisory district, in connection with the annual play festival\r\nwhich he had established several years before. This proved to be a huge\r\nsuccess and gave the boys and girls from the district schools new\r\nconfidence in their ability of self-expression. One of the greatest\r\nneeds which farmers' organizations are to-day feeling is their lack of\r\nleaders who can speak for them effectively at public gatherings and\r\nbefore legislative hearings in competition with men who make their\r\nliving by talking. Such contests, particularly when the topics discussed\r\ndeal with affairs of country life with which the children are acquainted\r\nand in which they are vitally interested, as was the case with the one\r\nat Oxford and to which much of its success was attributed, are therefore\r\nof great value and may well be substituted for the academic debates so\r\noften heard on subjects quite foreign to the child's life and beyond his\r\nreal comprehension.\r\n\r\nIn many places new school buildings are being constructed with an\r\nauditorium, which may be used as a gymnasium, library room, dining room,\r\netc., so that they may serve as social centers for the community. Where\r\nthe community is not large enough to afford a separate community house\r\nthis is frequently the best and most economical means of meeting this\r\nneed. This will be discussed further in considering community buildings.\r\n\r\nNumerous rural high schools are conducting lyceum and entertainment\r\ncourses, and some are operating motion-picture shows on Saturday nights.\r\nWhere no other organization is better adapted for taking the\r\nresponsibility of furnishing high-class entertainment to the community,\r\nthis is a useful service. School orchestras and bands, choruses, and\r\ndramatic clubs are also valuable additions to the community life.\r\n\r\nThe successful community school will not center all of its activities in\r\nits own building, but it will take some of its talent to the country\r\nschools for local athletic and play contests, dramatic or musical\r\nentertainments, etc., and thus magnify the importance of the local\r\nschool in the neighborhood, for only by acquiring a desire for these\r\nadvantages will the people in the more isolated parts of the community\r\ncome to interest themselves in the activities of the whole community at\r\nits village center.\r\n\r\nIt is becoming more and more apparent that if the school is really to\r\nfunction as it should, that it must have the active interest and support\r\nof its patrons. It is not enough that they should assemble at the annual\r\nschool meeting, elect school officials, vote taxes for its maintenance,\r\nand then leave its management to the school board and teachers. It is\r\nhighly desirable that every encouragement should be given toward making\r\nteaching a life profession, but as teaching becomes professionalized it\r\ntends, like every other calling, to become more or less of a\r\nbureaucracy. It is essential that educational methods should be\r\ndetermined by and be in charge of educators who are trained for such\r\nservice, but if they get the idea, as sometimes seems unfortunately the\r\ncase, that it is the business of the people to supply funds for the\r\nsupport of the schools and then to leave their entire operation to the\r\nteachers and superintendents, they assume an attitude which is fatal to\r\nthe life of the school, for no educational system, however ideal in\r\ntheory, can be effective without the sympathetic understanding and\r\ncordial support of the majority of its patrons. It is for this reason\r\nthat large emphasis is being placed by progressive educators on the\r\norganization of parent-teachers associations or school improvement\r\nleagues for the discussion of school problems by parents and teachers.\r\nIn many cases the parent-teachers association forms one of the chief\r\nbonds of the country community and the State of Virginia has built up a\r\nremarkable system of community organization through its Coöperative\r\nEducational League with hundreds of local leagues which interest\r\nthemselves in all phases of community life.\r\n\r\nThe school is also coming to realize that although it is the institution\r\nspecially created for the systematic education of the child, that much\r\nof his education is received outside the school and that certain phases\r\nof his education may be accomplished more effectively through the\r\ncoöperation of the school with other institutions and agencies. Thus\r\ninstead of seeking to absorb all of the time of the child and to give it\r\nall kinds of training within the school or as part of its curriculum,\r\nthe school is commencing to develop methods for strengthening and\r\ncoördinating the educational work of the home, the church, and of\r\nvarious organizations.\r\n\r\nThe teaching of agriculture has been made vital and effective by the\r\nhome project in which the boy comes to appreciate the value of the\r\nprinciples studied at school in connection with an agricultural\r\nenterprise in raising crops or livestock of his own on the home farm.\r\nThis tends to enlist the interest of the parents, who contribute largely\r\nto the educational process. The same principle is being applied to a\r\nless extent in work in home economics, and the giving of school credit\r\nfor various kinds of home work has established a community of interest\r\nbetween home and school. In the teaching of hygiene, and particularly\r\nwith regard to sex hygiene, the school finds it difficult to establish\r\nthose habits and attitudes which are as important as mere knowledge\r\nwithout the help and coöperation of the home. So, too, the medical\r\ninspection of school children, with the work of school nurses and\r\nclinics held at the school for children of pre-school age, stimulate the\r\nhome to better health.\r\n\r\nBecause of the separation of church and state in this country we have\r\nvery largely neglected all effort toward religious education in our\r\npublic schools, and even ethical training has been more or less of a\r\nsecondary objective until very recently. A growing appreciation of the\r\ninadequacy of the ordinary Sunday school has led to a movement for\r\ngiving systematic instruction and training in religious education under\r\nchurch auspices at a time set apart by the school and for which school\r\ncredit is given when it meets reasonable educational standards. The\r\nweek-day school of religion is still in an experimental stage. It has\r\nbeen established longest in cities, but is now being attempted in rural\r\ncommunities, and if sectarian dogmatism and jealousies can be submerged,\r\nthere seems every reason to hope that this may be a most important\r\nfeature of our educational system.\r\n\r\nSo, too, the boys' and girls' clubs in agriculture and home economics,\r\nthe boy and girl scouts, the campfires, the little mothers' leagues, the\r\nhealth crusades, the Y.M.C.A and Y.W.C.A., and other organizations for\r\nchildren and youth, have created new interest in certain aspects of\r\nschool work and are a source of educational dynamic which progressive\r\neducators are utilizing as valuable allies.\r\n\r\nThus in very many ways the school is adapting its methods to meet its\r\nresponsibility for developing good citizens who are loyal to the welfare\r\nof the community, and the school principal is rightly expected to be a\r\nleader in community affairs in so far as they concern the participation\r\nand interests of the school.\r\n\r\nIt is a far cry from the isolated one-room, box-type district school,\r\nwith a young girl with no professional training teaching a dozen\r\nyoungsters of all ages as best she can with little or no equipment, to\r\nthe modern consolidated school or rural high school with all the\r\nintimate connections with the life of the whole community above\r\ndescribed, but this difference measures one phase of the progress which\r\nhas been made in recent years toward the integration of the rural\r\ncommunity and depicts one of the most important forces involved in this\r\nprocess, whose influence is only commencing to be felt. How different\r\nwill the life of rural communities be a generation or two hence when in\r\nmost of them practically all of the parents and children will have had a\r\nhigh-school education, with all the broader contacts and outlook on life\r\nwhich that involves! We need only to study the influence of the Danish\r\nFolk High Schools[42] to visualize the outcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC LIBRARY\r\n\r\nThe public library has possibilities as an educational institution\r\nexceeded only by those of the school. In many cases it is the\r\nintellectual center of the community, while in others the caricature of\r\nthe library of Gopher Prairie in Sinclair Lewis' \"Main Street,\" where\r\none of the chief objects was to keep the books from being soiled or worn\r\nout, is not much overdrawn. Increasingly, however, the librarian is\r\nstudying methods of salesmanship for increasing the local consumption of\r\nthe products of the world's best minds in books and magazines, and is of\r\ninestimable service to all organizations whose members have occasion to\r\nstudy what human thought has contributed to the solution of their\r\nproblems. The public library gives the means of further education to\r\nmany a person deprived of academic privileges, who may realize the truth\r\nof Carlyle's saying: \"The true University of these days is a Collection\r\nof Books.\"\r\n\r\nIn many states public libraries are aided by state and local\r\nappropriations, particularly in New England and the states settled by\r\nNew England stock, for it is to New England[43] that we are indebted for\r\nthe public library as well as the public school. It is not, however,\r\neconomically possible for every small community to support a permanent\r\nlocal library, and many of those established have a precarious existence\r\nand are maintained only through the devotion of public-spirited\r\nindividuals. To meet the need of isolated neighborhoods a few county\r\nlibraries, notably in Washington County, Maryland, and a few counties in\r\nDelaware and Minnesota, have made use of book-wagons which are\r\naccompanied by a librarian who makes a \"rural free delivery\" of books to\r\neach home and assists the families in their selection. It seems,\r\nhowever, that the chief value of the book-wagon is as a means of\r\ncreating a desire for books, and that when this is created it will be\r\nmuch more economical to furnish them through branch stations at\r\nneighborhood or community centers. Systems of traveling libraries are\r\nalso supported by many states and make it possible for the most isolated\r\nneighborhoods to secure the best of books. Unfortunately, however, the\r\nplaces which need them most do not always know of them nor will they\r\ntake the initiative to secure them. They are of particular value for\r\nsecuring collections of books on special topics for the use of granges,\r\nchurches, and study clubs of all sorts. But as the demand for traveling\r\nlibraries grows, the administration of the system from the state library\r\nbecomes a large undertaking and the need of better local libraries is\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\nA system of \"county libraries\" has been developed in California, has\r\nspread to several other states, and is now being advocated by the\r\nAmerican Library Association and by library leaders generally. Under the\r\ncounty system a central library is established at the county seat, with\r\nbranches or loan stations at the different community centers, and with\r\ntraveling collections for the more isolated neighborhoods. The larger\r\ncenters which have local libraries continue to maintain them and simply\r\nserve as part of the system. Thus the library resources of the county\r\nare pooled and the farm people are given the same sort of service that a\r\ncity library gives its people through its branches. The feature of\r\ninterest from a community standpoint is that, although this is a county\r\nsystem, it recognizes the usefulness of local branches and makes\r\npossible a library service adapted to its needs for every small\r\ncommunity, whereas separate libraries have heretofore been possible only\r\nin the larger centers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRY WEEKLY\r\n\r\nOne of the most important educational agencies of the rural community is\r\nthe oft-derided weekly newspaper. After a period of difficult\r\ncompetition with city dailies the surviving weeklies are becoming\r\nrecognized as community institutions. Those which are succeeding are\r\ndoing so by becoming the voice of the community and the means of its\r\nself-acquaintance. No agency may be more powerful in unifying or\r\ndisrupting the life of the local community. This new concept of the\r\ncountry weekly has been well expressed by W. P. Kirkwood, of the\r\nUniversity of Minnesota:\r\n\r\n      \"Community building was a concept unknown to the editor of\r\n      thirty or forty years ago. To-day it is an accepted concept\r\n      of dynamic force, full of significance in most of the\r\n      country towns of America.\r\n\r\n      \"Community service, as such a concept, is fast finding its\r\n      way into the country press--in the Middle West, at least. As\r\n      this ideal gains acceptance, giving definite direction to\r\n      newspaper effort for the upbuilding of communities, the\r\n      press gains an enlarged constituency with a truer conception\r\n      of the power and usefulness of the newspaper....\r\n\r\n      \"Community service, community building, then, as a master\r\n      motive, establishes the country weekly newspaper publisher\r\n      securely in his position of leadership. It assures added\r\n      community prosperity and the local development of the finer\r\n      satisfactions of life in which he must share, and no other\r\n      agency can take this from him, neither the city daily,\r\n      coming in from a distance and concerned with the larger\r\n      affairs of the larger community, nor the school, nor the\r\n      church, nor any other.\"[44]\r\n\r\nIn a bulletin on \"The Country Weekly in New York State,\"[45] Professor\r\nM. V. Atwood, of the New York State College of Agriculture and for\r\nseveral years a successful publisher, discusses the purposes and future\r\nof the country weekly. He holds that the country weekly is not, as often\r\nstated, and should not be a molder of public opinion, but should rather\r\nexpress and interpret the sentiment of its constituency.\r\n\r\n      \"The country newspaper,\" he says, \"is a service agency; it\r\n      is a community institution like the church, the school, the\r\n      library, and the farm and home bureau. It helps all these\r\n      institutions to do their work....\r\n\r\n      \"If the country newspaper does not do much thought-molding\r\n      it does offer a medium for the dissemination of thought, for\r\n      the propagation of ideas of the people of the community. The\r\n      value of the newspaper to the community becomes especially\r\n      apparent when some local project is to be considered, like\r\n      the erection of a school, the building of good roads, or the\r\n      installation of a water system. For weeks the paper will\r\n      offer in the form of letters, the views of different people\r\n      of the community. The subject is thoroughly aired. Even if\r\n      the editor takes no sides in the matter, his paper has been\r\n      of inestimable service to the community.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, as we shall see later, such a free discussion is a most\r\nessential step in all community activities, and the service of the\r\nnewspaper is probably greater if it acts as a free and open forum for\r\ndiscussion rather than a partisan of either side. Of the news of the\r\nfuture, Professor Atwood says:\r\n\r\n      \"Most of these papers will also be printing much more farm\r\n      news than they do to-day because as the publishers have\r\n      surveyed their fields they will have found the primary\r\n      interest of their readers is agricultural. There will be\r\n      some exceptions for some communities will have ceased to be\r\n      dominated by agriculture because of the coming of factories.\r\n      The real country weeklies will not become agricultural text\r\n      hooks; but the news of the farms, the improvements to farm\r\n      buildings, and the experiences of successful local farmers\r\n      will find much space in their columns.\r\n\r\n      \"The community editor of the future is not going to worry\r\n      much about 'hot' news. He will realize that most of the\r\n      striking facts of any story have already been printed in the\r\n      neighboring city papers, but he will realize also that the\r\n      genuine community interest in the event has not been\r\n      glimpsed by the city editor, who is out of touch with the\r\n      local situation; around these community aspects the local\r\n      editor will weave his story.\"\r\n\r\nPossibly the best appreciation of the country weekly is a prose poem\r\nwritten by Professor Bristow Adams, editor of the New York State College\r\nof Agriculture, and presented at the first country newspaper conference\r\nheld at that institution during Farmers Week 1920, entitled \"I am the\r\nCountry Weekly,\"[46] and which vividly depicts its service as an agency\r\nfor developing community consciousness:\r\n\r\n      \"I am the Country Weekly.\r\n\r\n      \"I am the friend of the family, the bringer of tidings from\r\n      other friends; I speak to the home in the evening light of\r\n      summers vine-clad porch or the glow of winters lamp.\r\n\r\n      \"I help to make this evening hour; I record the great and\r\n      the small, the varied acts of the days and weeks that go to\r\n      make up life.\r\n\r\n      \"I am for and of the home; I follow those who leave humble\r\n      beginnings; whether they go to greatness or to the gutter, I\r\n      take to them the thrill of old days, with wholesome\r\n      messages.\r\n\r\n      \"I speak the language of the common man; my words are fitted\r\n      to his understanding. My congregation is larger than that of\r\n      any church in my town; my readers are more than those in the\r\n      school. Young and old alike find in me stimulation,\r\n      instruction, entertainment, inspiration, solace, comfort. I\r\n      am the chronicler of birth, and love and death--the three\r\n      great facts of man's existence.\r\n\r\n      \"I bring together buyer and seller, to the benefit of both;\r\n      I am part of the market-place of the world. Into the home I\r\n      carry word of the goods which feed and clothe, and shelter,\r\n      and which minister to comfort, ease, health, and happiness.\r\n\r\n      \"I am the word of the week, the history of the year, the\r\n      record of my community in the archives of state and nation.\r\n\r\n      \"I am the exponent of the lives of my readers.\r\n\r\n      \"I am the Country Weekly.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[40] Out of 185 neighborhood areas, 39 were chiefly due to the school\r\ndistrict, the next most important influence being the church parish\r\nwhich determined the neighborhood in 33 cases.

W. Hayes, in his \"Rural\r\nCommunity Organization\" (Chap. VI, Univ. of Chicago Press, 1921). In\r\nRandolph County more of the schools are located in the open country\r\nwhile the more recent consolidations in Marshall County are located\r\nmostly at the village centers.

This made a\r\ngrant of public land to each state to establish a college for\r\ninstruction in agriculture and the mechanic arts, and it has been the\r\ninfluence of the \"land-grant colleges,\" more than any other agency,\r\nwhich has been responsible for our agricultural advancement. In 1888 the\r\nHatch Act made an annual federal appropriation to each of these colleges\r\nfor the establishment of an agricultural experiment station, whose\r\ninvestigations, with those of the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture, have been largely responsible for the scientific basis of\r\nmodern agriculture.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning the agricultural colleges realized their obligation\r\nto bring the results of scientific investigations to the attention of\r\nfarmers as well as to their own students, and their faculties spoke\r\nbefore meetings of state and county agricultural societies, granges, and\r\nfarmers' institutes. In 1875 Michigan was the first state to make an\r\nappropriation to its State Board of Agriculture for conducting farmers'\r\ninstitutes, and in the next twenty-five years most of the states\r\nestablished systems of farmers' institutes either under their state\r\nboards or departments of agriculture or under the agricultural colleges,\r\nthrough which itinerant speakers addressed one or more meetings of\r\nfarmers in each county every year. These institutes grew in popularity\r\nand led to separate meetings for farm women, and sometimes for children,\r\nand in some cases permanent county organizations were created for\r\nholding institutes with local speakers as well as for managing those\r\nfurnished by the state. Farmers' institutes have performed an important\r\nservice in the education of the rural community. Not only have they\r\ngiven instruction in methods of agriculture and in the problems of\r\ncountry life, but they have been an important means of bringing rural\r\npeople together in a common cause; they are a community activity and\r\nstrengthen the community bond. In many cases in isolated localities the\r\nannual farmers' institute has been one of the few occasions at which the\r\npeople of the community get together, and has been looked forward to as\r\na social event. Furthermore, it was through experience with farmers'\r\ninstitutes that the need of better means for bringing instruction to\r\nrural communities was appreciated and other methods were developed.\r\n\r\nIt was but a few years after the establishment of the agricultural\r\nexperiment stations under the Hatch Act of 1888, that the colleges\r\ncommenced to realize that the results of their investigations would not\r\nbe extensively utilized by farmers unless other means were employed than\r\nmere publication of reports and bulletins and addresses at farmers'\r\ninstitutes and agricultural meetings. These were good, but they were\r\nfelt to be inadequate and it was evident that to secure the general\r\nadoption of new methods some means of more systematic instruction and of\r\nlocal demonstrations were necessary. The agricultural colleges came to\r\nfeel that they should have definite departments with men who could\r\ndevote their time to giving instruction to the people on the land. The\r\nfirst appropriation for agricultural extension work was made to Cornell\r\nUniversity by the State of New York in 1894, but it was a decade later\r\nbefore the leading agricultural colleges had established departments of\r\nextension work. In general the early period of the extension movement\r\nwas chiefly concerned with methods of agricultural production and had no\r\ndefinite program for the local organization of its work. This finally\r\ncame about through the county agent movement.\r\n\r\nThe county agent movement[47] had its origin in an effort to combat the\r\nravages of the Mexican Cotton Boll Weevil as it swept through Texas and\r\nadvanced eastward from 1900 to 1910. It was in 1903 that Dr. S. A. Knapp\r\nwas commissioned by the Federal Secretary of Agriculture, James Wilson,\r\nto devise methods whereby the Texas farmers might be shown how they\r\ncould grow cotton in spite of the weevil. He soon found that progressive\r\nfarmers who were using the cultural methods which the entomologists had\r\nfound to be successful for raising an early crop, were able to raise\r\nfairly good crops before injury became serious. He therefore employed\r\npractical farmers to go among their neighbors and get them to agree to\r\ngive a fair trial to the methods advocated by the government, i.e., to\r\ndemonstrate their practicability. Those making the trials were called\r\n\"demonstrators\" and their neighbors who came to follow their example in\r\ntesting the new methods were called \"coöperators\" and were called\r\ntogether at the \"demonstrator's\" farm to see the results of his work and\r\nto receive instruction from the \"demonstration agent\" who supervised the\r\nwork for the government. As this work was in charge of practical farmers\r\nmore or less known locally, it appealed to the farmers as a\r\ncommon-sense method, the results spoke for themselves, and the demand\r\nfor the work spread rapidly. Dr. Knapp found that the county was the\r\nbest unit for the work of the supervising demonstration agent, and he\r\nsoon came to be known as the county demonstration agent, which was later\r\ncontracted to county agent or county agricultural agent. The whole\r\nmovement came to be called \"the farmers' coöperative demonstration\r\nwork.\" Three new features in agricultural instruction of farmers were\r\ninvolved in this system; it was more or less coöperative on the part of\r\na local group of farmers; it used the demonstration method of teaching,\r\ni.e., the farmer demonstrated to himself by his own trial; and a local\r\ncounty agent was employed for the supervision of the work. It soon\r\nbecame apparent that merely trying to circumvent the depredations of the\r\nboll weevil would not solve the problem and that instead of raising only\r\ncotton as a cash crop the farmer must diversify his crops so as to raise\r\nmore of the foodstuffs consumed on the farm and to have other products\r\nfor sale. This involved the application of the demonstration method to\r\nthe growing of corn, legumes, hogs, etc., in short, it involved the\r\nwhole field of farm management and agricultural practice. The work of\r\nthe county agricultural agents was liberally supported by local business\r\nmen, commercial clubs and railroads, and the General Education Board, as\r\nwell as by the U. S. Department of Agriculture. In 1909 the Mississippi\r\nlegislature passed the first act permitting counties to appropriate\r\nfunds for this work, and this was followed by most of the southern\r\nstates within a few years.\r\n\r\nThe Report of President Roosevelt's Country Life Commission in 1909\r\ncalled attention to the need of a national system of agricultural\r\nextension work in charge of the agricultural colleges, and congressmen\r\nand agricultural leaders in the North who had observed the success of\r\nthe county agent movement in the South commenced to feel that county\r\nagricultural agents might be equally valuable in the North as a means of\r\nlocal agricultural education. As a result, the first county agricultural\r\nagents in the North were appointed by the Office of Farm Management of\r\nthe U. S. Department of Agriculture in 1910 and 1911. In 1912, 113 were\r\nemployed in coöperation with the state agricultural colleges and local\r\ncounty organizations in the North and West. The success of the work of\r\nthese agents and of the extension work of the agricultural colleges led\r\nto a general demand from the agricultural interests of the country for a\r\nfederal appropriation to the agricultural colleges for establishing a\r\nsystem of extension work the chief feature of which would be the\r\nemployment of county agricultural agents who would supervise field\r\ndemonstrations by the farmers on their own farms. This resulted in the\r\nfederal Smith-Lever Act of 1914, which made an annual appropriation to\r\neach land-grant college \"to aid in diffusing among the people of the\r\nUnited States useful and practical information on agriculture and home\r\neconomics and to encourage the application of the same ... through field\r\ndemonstrations, publications, and otherwise, ... to persons not\r\nattending or resident at said college.\" This act is notable in that it\r\nestablished the most comprehensive national system of non-resident\r\ninstruction in agriculture and home economics of any country, and\r\nrecognized the necessity of de-centralizing this instruction by having\r\nit carried on by agents in the counties who could have immediate and\r\ncontinuous contact with individual farmers and groups of farmers.\r\n\r\nAs the work of the county agents in the South grew more permanent they\r\nfound that it was more efficient if they worked with and through local\r\ngroups of farmers, and community agricultural clubs were quite widely\r\norganized, but no strong county federation was developed, except in West\r\nVirginia, where the local clubs formed a county organization which was\r\ncalled a Farm Bureau. The term Farm Bureau originated in Broome County,\r\nNew York, in 1911, when the first county agent in that state was\r\nemployed by the Binghamton Chamber of Commerce, the Lackawanna Railroad,\r\nand the U. S. Department of Agriculture. As the number of county agents\r\nrapidly increased in the northern states it soon became apparent that if\r\ntheir work was to be of the greatest service to the farmers for whose\r\nbenefit they worked, that it should be supported and managed by the\r\nfarmers themselves rather than by business interests. The Farm Bureau\r\nAssociation, composed of farmers throughout a county, soon came to be a\r\nprerequisite to the placing of an agricultural agent in a county, and\r\nwith the passage of the Smith-Lever Act and of state legislation\r\naccepting its provisions and appropriating state funds contingent upon\r\nsimilar appropriations by the counties, this became the usual procedure.\r\nThe county farm bureau association coöperates with the state college of\r\nagriculture and the U. S. Department of Agriculture in the employment of\r\nthe county agent, and the annual membership fees together with county\r\nappropriations pay the expenses of the work other than salary. The\r\naffairs of the farm bureau association are in the hands of the usual\r\nofficers and executive committee, who report to an annual meeting of the\r\nmembership. Further than this the method of organization varies in\r\ndifferent states. In most of the northern and western states there is a\r\nlocal committee in each community which arranges for the demonstrations\r\nand meetings to be held by the county agent, and there is no further\r\norganization of the local membership, but in a few states definite local\r\norganizations or community clubs with officers and regular meetings\r\nhave developed. In either case, however, the unit of local organization\r\nand interest in the work of the farm bureau is usually the community,\r\nalthough its executive administration is on a county basis.\r\n\r\nAs the extension work came under the local control of these\r\norganizations of farmers, the objectives of the work were more largely\r\ndetermined by the farmers' point of view. Whereas the original purpose\r\nhad been to \"extend\" to the farmer the better methods of agriculture\r\ndiscovered by the experiment stations and the federal department of\r\nagriculture, the program of work came to be largely determined by the\r\nparticular needs and problems of the local communities in a given\r\ncounty. The farmers conferred with the agent--their agent--and pointed\r\nout their greatest difficulties. The program of work was then a matter\r\nof determining what demonstrations and instruction could be arranged to\r\nmeet these problems, under the direction of the county agent and with\r\nany assistance possible from the state agricultural college. With the\r\nrapid growth of Farm Bureaus,--for on June 30, 1918, there were 791 farm\r\nbureaus with approximately 290,000 members,--the movement became truly a\r\nfarmers' movement rather than a mere \"extension\" of the work of the\r\nagricultural colleges, though the close affiliation with them\r\nconstituted its strength and furnished its leadership.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that almost as soon as the Smith-Lever Act became\r\neffective the world was plunged into war and marketing problems became\r\nmore and more important. Whereas in the first decade of the county agent\r\nmovement interest had been chiefly in better methods of production, it\r\nnow rapidly shifted to include better methods of marketing and the\r\ndevelopment of coöperative selling associations, whose organization was\r\nassisted by the farm bureaus wherever they were needed and practicable.\r\n\r\nThe entry of the United States into the World War greatly accelerated\r\nthe farm bureau movement. \"Food will win the war\" was the slogan which\r\nchallenged American agriculture. The number of county agents in the\r\nNorth and West increased from 542 to 1,133 within the year ending June\r\n30, 1918. It was the county agent system which formed the mechanism\r\nthrough which the federal government secured the whole-souled\r\ncoöperation of the farmers of the United States under peculiarly trying\r\nconditions. The winter of 1917-18 was severe and seed corn was unusually\r\npoor. As a result, the available supply of sound seed corn in the spring\r\nof 1918 was the lowest on record in the face of the greatest need for a\r\nbumper crop. Had it not been for the remarkable organization developed\r\nthrough the county agents and the farm bureau system of the entire\r\ncountry, the corn crop of the great Corn Belt would have been far below\r\nnormal. As it was, nearly a normal acreage was planted and an abundant\r\nharvest secured. The rôle which the agriculture of the United States\r\nplayed in the World War has never been adequately written or\r\nappreciated, but it was full of as much romance and heroism as were the\r\nindustries which commanded the headlines of the press. Dr. Bradford\r\nKnapp, for many years in charge of the county agent work in the Southern\r\nStates after the death of his father, its founder, has called attention\r\nto the fact that during the war \"of the four great activities or\r\nindustries in America, agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and\r\ntransportation,--one alone--agriculture, stood the test, and that mainly\r\nbecause there was already in existence an organization extending from\r\nthe United States Department of Agriculture through every state\r\nagricultural college ... to the counties and the farmers, by which\r\ninformation was rapidly disseminated and farmers were made aware of\r\nconditions of what must be done to win the war.\"\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that such an organization growing rapidly during a war\r\nshould develop an unusual solidarity, and this was but strengthened by\r\nthe difficulties which agriculture encountered with the cessation of\r\nhostilities. During the war several states had formed state federations\r\nof the county farm bureau associations and in November, 1919, a\r\nconvention was called at Chicago for the formation of a national\r\norganization, which resulted in the formal organization of the American\r\nFarm Bureau Federation[48] in March, 1920, with 28 states represented,\r\nand a membership in county farm bureaus of 400,000. In the next two\r\nyears the southern states, which previously had developed no strong\r\ncounty organizations, rapidly adopted the farm bureau idea, and when the\r\nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation held its second annual meeting at\r\nAtlanta, Ga., in November, 1921, it included 35 states with a local\r\nmembership of 967,279.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt at length upon the growth of the county agent and farm\r\nbureau movement, because there is probably no one agency which has done\r\nmore in the last decade toward the integration of rural communities\r\nthroughout the United States or which has had a larger educational\r\ninfluence on all aspects of country life. The farm bureau usually\r\norganizes its local work by communities and in large numbers of counties\r\nthe community areas have been defined for the first time by the county\r\nagents. The value of this organization by communities was repeatedly\r\nshown during the war. For example, in New York State it was possible\r\nfor the county agents to organize meetings on the Agricultural\r\nMobilization Day called by the Governor on April 21, 1917, in 1,089\r\ncommunities, with an attendance of 85,075 persons, upon only a weeks\r\nnotice. In several of the states which have encouraged community\r\norganizations, a very definite effort has been made to develop an\r\nall-round program of community improvement. Thus the West Virginia\r\nextension service has invented a community score card[49] with which\r\nseveral communities have scored themselves for three successive years in\r\norder to make an analysis of their social situation and to enable them\r\nto outline a program of work for the solution of their local problems.\r\nSeveral of the states are now employing specialists to assist the farm\r\nbureaus in their problems of community organization.\r\n\r\nThe county organization of extension work has been unique in its\r\neducational methods; methods which have large significance for all\r\nmovements for rural progress.\r\n\r\nFirst, its educational method is that of the demonstration carried out\r\nby farm people under the expert direction of paid county leaders in an\r\neffort to solve the immediate problems of the farm and the farm home. It\r\nbuilds on the experience, point of view, and interests of its pupils,\r\nwho learn under the supervision of a teacher chosen by them, through a\r\nprocess which involves their making real experiments in finding the best\r\nsolution of their problems. No class of people, here or elsewhere, has\r\never had opportunity for the training in the scientific attitude and\r\npoint of view which American farmers may now receive, and on account of\r\nthe nature and organization of their work they are steadily and surely,\r\nif not entirely consciously, adopting the method of science. The\r\nconsequence of this movement in the social and political development of\r\nthis country cannot be foretold, for the scientific attitude must\r\nfinally be the basis of all true democracy.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the program of work--the subject matter of the educational\r\nmethod--is largely chosen by the people themselves, but with the help of\r\nexperts employed by them to supervise its execution. Here we have an\r\ninstitution arising from the land, wholly democratic in spirit and\r\npolity, yet recognizing the services of experts and employing them for\r\nits own purposes. In the county farm bureaus, and the organizations to\r\nwhich they have given rise, there is developing a new use of science\r\nboth in the educational methods and in the employment of scientifically\r\ntrained leaders, in the service of and directed by a democracy--a\r\ndemocracy no longer provincial but of national scope in that there is\r\nreal coöperation between the local community, the county, the state, and\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nLastly, the extension movement recognizes that only by the development\r\nand training of the largest amount of enthusiastic, voluntary, local\r\nleadership can its work have a foundation which will make it permanent.\r\nIt thus recognizes an essential factor of all social organization, i.e.,\r\nthe power of personal leadership in shaping the public opinion of the\r\ngroup, and it consciously undertakes the development of intelligent\r\ninitiative as a means of social progress.\r\n\r\nWhen one has observed the feeble beginnings of this movement only a\r\ndecade ago, and has witnessed its growth to the present nation-wide\r\nsystem, promoting plans for national organizations for coöperative\r\nmarketing, he appreciates the power of science, education, and\r\norganization as new forces in the life of the rural community, whose\r\nfuture influence one would be rash to prophesy.\r\n\r\nThis account would be misleading if it failed to indicate that the\r\nextension movement has given attention to the problems of the farm home,\r\nof the mother and the children, as well as to those of the farm\r\nbusiness. In 1910, girls' canning clubs were started in the Southern\r\nStates and young women were employed to supervise their work. Very soon\r\nthe mothers became interested and before long home demonstration agents\r\nwere appointed to work with the agricultural demonstration agents. In\r\n1916 home demonstration work was in progress in 420 counties in the\r\nSouth. A few home demonstration agents were employed by farm bureaus in\r\nthe Northern States prior to 1917, but the additional funds appropriated\r\nby Congress for food conservation work during the war caused a rapid\r\nincrease in their number and women's work in the North received its\r\nchief impetus during the war. The Smith-Lever Act specified that its\r\nfunds should be used for extension work in home economics as well as in\r\nagriculture, but it was not until the farm bureaus commenced to employ\r\nhome demonstration agents and to organize the women for their support\r\nthat work with the farm home became established on a permanent basis. In\r\nmost of the northern states the farm bureau is now organized on what is\r\ncalled the \"family plan,\" that is, it includes in its program of work\r\nprojects dealing with the farm for men, with the farm home for women,\r\nand with club work in agriculture and home economics for boys and girls.\r\nIn many of the states a separate agent is employed for each of these\r\nlines of work and the women are organized in a separate department of\r\nthe county farm bureau and have their own local farm women's clubs. In\r\nNew York State the women's work has been further differentiated by\r\norganizing it as a County Home Bureau which with the Farm Bureau forms\r\nthe County Farm and Home Bureau Association.\r\n\r\nDuring the war the home demonstration agents gave their attention to\r\nfood conservations and clothing, but as a permanent program has\r\ndeveloped the local clubs of farm women have shown a lively interest in\r\nproblems of health, home management, care of children, education,\r\nrecreation, and civics. They have found that the problems of the home\r\ncannot be solved without an effort to create better community conditions\r\nand \"community housekeeping\" has attracted an increasing interest. The\r\npresent aims of the women's work have been aptly phrased in the Home\r\nBureau Creed written by Dr. Ruby Green Smith, associate state leader of\r\nhome demonstration agents in New York:\r\n\r\n      The Home Bureau Creed\r\n\r\n      \"To maintain the highest ideals of home life; to count\r\n      children the most important of crops; to so mother them that\r\n      their bodies may be sound, their minds clear, their spirits\r\n      happy, and their characters generous:\r\n\r\n      \"To place service above comfort; to let loyalty to high\r\n      purposes silence discordant note; to let neighborliness\r\n      supplant hatreds; to be discouraged never:\r\n\r\n      \"To lose self in generous enthusiasms; to extend to the less\r\n      fortunate a helping hand; to believe one's community may\r\n      become the best of communities; and to coöperate with others\r\n      for the common ends of a more abundant home and community\r\n      life:\r\n\r\n      \"This is the offer of the Home Bureau to the homemaker of\r\n      to-day.\"\r\n\r\nNor should we fail to recognize the part which the boys' and girls' club\r\nwork has had in the extension movement. Space will not permit any\r\nadequate account of its origin and growth, or of its methods and\r\ninfluence. No movement has done more to redirect and give dynamic to the\r\nrural school than has the club work; nor has any movement done more to\r\ntrain leadership among the coming generation on the farms. Commencing\r\nwith corn clubs for the boys, canning clubs were soon organized for the\r\ngirls, and later pig clubs, potato clubs, calf clubs, sewing clubs,\r\ncooking clubs, and clubs are now organized with various projects\r\ncovering almost all phases of agriculture and home economics. These\r\nclubs may be called the Junior Farm Bureau, for in them farm children\r\nare receiving a training which will mean much for the future\r\norganization of country life. The public confidence in the work is shown\r\nby the fact that in 1920, 500 banks in the northern and western states\r\nloaned nearly $900,000 to club boys and girls for financing their\r\nprojects.[50] As a result of the school exhibits of the products of the\r\nclub work, many a community fair has been started, and as a result of\r\nclub picnics and play days community picnics or festivals have become an\r\nannual event in many places and have brought better feeling and\r\nincreased pride and loyalty to the community. In 1919, 464,979 boys and\r\ngirls were enrolled in club work.\r\n\r\nThus the extension movement started by the agricultural colleges and the\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture has become a national movement\r\nof rural people, men, women, and children, whose strength is largely due\r\nto the fact that it has been the means of organizing the local\r\ncommunities and of bringing them together in county organizations, which\r\nwith the aid of state and national funds and supervision, employ trained\r\nexecutives to stimulate and supervise the work of the local groups. It\r\nis a unique agency for the education and organization of rural life\r\nwhich is giving the American farmer a new position in the life of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[47] This movement can only be sketched in barest outline.

Several of\r\nthe original thirteen colonies which formed the United States were\r\nsettled by those seeking freedom to worship as they chose, and as their\r\ndescendants migrated westward many of the new settlements were largely\r\ncomposed of the membership of some one church or those of a similar\r\nfaith. Dr. Warren H. Wilson has called attention to the fact that the\r\nMormons, the Pennsylvania Germans, and the Scotch Presbyterians are the\r\nmost successful farmers and remain on the land because they have given a\r\nreligious sanction to country life and have made the church the center\r\nof the life of the community, as it was in the medieval village\r\ncommunity of Europe. Whatever attitude one may take toward their\r\nreligious beliefs, all impartial observers are agreed that the Mormons\r\nhave established the strongest agricultural communities and that they\r\nhave discovered and applied to a high degree some of the most\r\nfundamental principles of social organization. Concerning them Dr.\r\nWilson says:\r\n\r\n      \"These exceptional farmers are organized in the interest of\r\n      agriculture. The Mormons represent this organization in the\r\n      highest degree. Perhaps no other so large or so powerful a\r\n      body of united farmers is found in the whole country. They\r\n      have approached the economic questions of farming with\r\n      determination to till the soil. They distrust city life and\r\n      condemn it. They teach their children and they discipline\r\n      themselves to love the country, to appreciate its\r\n      advantages and to recognize that their own welfare is bound\r\n      up in their success as farmers, and in the continuance of\r\n      their farming communities. This agricultural organization\r\n      centers in their country churches. They have turned the\r\n      force of religion into a community making power, and from\r\n      the highest to the lowest of their church officers the\r\n      Mormon people are devoted to agriculture as a mode of\r\n      living.\"[51]\r\n\r\nBut although large numbers of communities throughout the United States\r\nwere settled by people of one religious faith, and thus had the\r\nstrongest bond of community, yet large areas were settled by scattered\r\nhomesteaders belonging to different sects, and as time went on,\r\nnewcomers came into the older communities and established churches of\r\nvarious denominations, so that throughout most of the country the\r\nchurches have come to have more of a divisive than a unifying influence\r\non community life.\r\n\r\nIn our discussion of the religious life of the rural community we shall\r\nconfine our attention to the protestant churches, because most of our\r\nrural people are protestants. It is true that in some sections, such as\r\nLouisiana and southern Maryland, and in many sections recently settled\r\nby Europeans, the people are mostly Roman Catholics; but in general the\r\ncatholic church is strongest in the cities and towns and does not have\r\nstrong rural parishes throughout the country. Throughout most of the\r\nUnited States the Methodist, Episcopal and Baptist denominations have by\r\nfar the largest number of churches and membership, and their traditions\r\nand methods have largely shaped the religious life of our rural\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nDuring the century in which the United States west of the Alleghanies\r\nhas been settled conditions have changed with such rapidity that the\r\nreligious life is still largely dominated by its development during the\r\ndays of early settlement and the present generation is faced with the\r\nproblem of readjustment of its religious institutions to meet the\r\npresent situation. In the days of the pioneer the circuit rider made his\r\nrounds over a large district, preaching at school houses and private\r\nhomes and in the few country churches at intervals of one to three\r\nmonths. As the country became more thickly populated, country churches\r\nsprang up and several of them were joined together in the employment of\r\na resident pastor with preaching at the larger churches every week and\r\nat the outlying stations once in two or three weeks. Doctrinal beliefs\r\nwere strong and theological differences were frequently bitter. The\r\npreaching was practically the only service of the church, except for an\r\nannual \"protracted meeting\" or revival. The main emphasis was upon the\r\npersonal salvation of the sinner. Sunday schools had not become a\r\nrecognized feature of the church and but little thought was given to\r\nreligious education and training by the church. The minister christened\r\nthe babies, married the young people and buried the dead, but otherwise,\r\nwith numerous preaching services, he was unable to do much pastoral\r\nwork. A large proportion of the rural churches were located in the open\r\ncountry and like the district school were largely neighborhood churches,\r\nfor bad roads and horse-drawn vehicles made it difficult for people to\r\ngo over two or three miles. In many cases several churches were\r\nestablished in a single village or in nearby neighborhoods by different\r\ndenominations and were largely supported by home-missionary aid\r\ncontributed by the older churches in the East and the wealthier city\r\nparishes. Prior to the Civil War when most of our population was engaged\r\nin farming and before the exodus of the last half century to the towns\r\nand cities, most of the rural churches were fairly well attended, but\r\nwith the recent decline in rural population, many of them, and\r\nparticularly those in the open country, have faced the same situation as\r\nthe district school in that there are now too few people to make\r\npossible the economic support of a pastor and church building.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it must be recognized that the standards of rural people\r\nhave changed as regards the church in the same way that they have\r\nconcerning the school. When all of the people have had a common school\r\neducation, many of them have had high school training, a few have been\r\nto college, and many of them now and then visit the larger churches of\r\ntowns and cities, they are no longer satisfied with the occasional\r\npreaching of an uneducated man, however religious and earnest he may be.\r\nThe Sunday school has become an established part of the work of the\r\nchurch and as people have appreciated the value of education in secular\r\naffairs, they have come to place more hope in the religious training of\r\ntheir children than in merely saving them by sudden conversion. The\r\nchurch is becoming more and more an institution for the training and\r\nexpression of religious life rather than only a place for preaching.\r\nMoreover, the church now has to meet the competition of other\r\ninstitutions and interests which did not exist in the earlier days. The\r\ngrange, the lodge, organizations of all sorts, moving pictures,\r\nathletics and automobiles, furnish means of association and command the\r\ninterest and support of the people, where formerly there was only the\r\nchurch for the righteous and the tavern or the saloon for the convivial.\r\n\r\nAll of these and other factors have conspired to weaken the relative\r\ninfluence of the church in our rural communities and the situation has\r\nbecome so serious in many sections that it has challenged the attention\r\nof denominational leaders. During the past fifteen years there have\r\nbeen a series of careful studies of the condition of the rural churches\r\nin various parts of the country. These studies have given indisputable\r\nevidence of the conditions responsible for the decline of the rural\r\nchurch and of the measures which must be taken if the religious life of\r\nthe rural community is to be adequately fostered; and they have clearly\r\nshown that the problems of the rural church must be solved from the\r\nstandpoint of meeting the religious needs of the rural community rather\r\nthan that of the interests of the individual church. In the older parts\r\nof the country, and--alas--far too frequently in the newer sections, the\r\nmost serious obstacle to the religious life of the community is an\r\nunnecessary number of churches, which divide its limited resources both\r\nof funds and leadership. Overchurching is more largely responsible for\r\nthe decadence of the rural church than any one factor. Small\r\ncongregations are unable to support a full time pastor, and where\r\nseveral of them are competing in a small community, it is deprived of\r\nthe services of a resident minister. Preaching once in two weeks and\r\npractically no pastoral visitation are not conducive to the life of a\r\nchurch. The small church maintains its Sunday school with difficulty for\r\nthere are too few of any one age for a satisfactory division of classes.\r\nEqually serious is the fact that the ablest men will not enter the\r\nministry to devote themselves to what they regard as an unnecessary and\r\nunchristian competition.\r\n\r\nTompkins County, where I live, is a fair average of rural New York. A\r\nrecent survey shows that but eight of its twenty-eight rural communities\r\nhave full time resident pastors, though there are ministers residing in\r\ntwenty-five parishes who also serve other parishes nearby. Throughout\r\nthe county there was one church for every 332 people, but the average\r\nvillage church had but 92 active members, and the average country\r\nchurch had but 32. The church membership has remained practically\r\nstationary for thirty years, while the attendance has decreased from 21\r\npercent of the rural population in 1890 to 14 percent in 1920. One\r\ncommunity of 900 population had five churches, no one of which had a\r\nresident pastor or over 45 members, while two of them had but 11 members\r\neach and were closed. Six strictly rural communities in the southern\r\npart of the county have 16 churches, though none of these places can\r\nproperly support more than one church with a resident pastor. After a\r\ncareful study of the whole county, I am of the opinion that if at least\r\none-third of the rural churches were abandoned or combined, the work of\r\nthe church would be greatly strengthened. This county is cited because\r\nit is fairly typical; many worse have been reported in other surveys.\r\n\r\nAnother handicap of the rural church is the frequent shift of ministers.\r\nIn Tompkins County only 4 of the 57 churches have had the same pastor\r\nfor ten years, 17 changed pastors three times in ten years and 17 of the\r\npastors had been in their parishes one year or less. When a minister\r\nstays but a year or two, his parishioners tend to be only acquaintances\r\nand rarely does he really know them. A minister cannot become well\r\nenough acquainted with a new parish to do effective pastoral work in\r\nless than a year, and many ministers who have seemingly good programs of\r\nwork fail to realize them because they attempt to force progress and to\r\nsecure results more rapidly than is possible. One of the chief duties of\r\nthe rural pastor is to train leadership. A church is no stronger than\r\nits permanent resident leadership. No matter how brilliant the work of\r\nthe minister, if he has failed to develop local leadership, his work is\r\nsoon dissipated when he leaves. Now leadership cannot be produced in a\r\nyear or so and where it is most needed it requires several years to\r\ndiscover and develop it. Unfortunately much of this frequent shifting of\r\nrural pastors is directly due to ecclesiastical rule rather than to the\r\nneeds of the local churches, though much of it results from meager\r\nsalaries and sectarian rivalries which soon discourage a man who sees\r\nlarger opportunities for service elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNumerous studies of the actual condition of the rural church in many\r\nparts of the country all show the futility of denominational competition\r\nin maintaining two or three churches where only one is needed or can be\r\nsupported. Furthermore, the present generation of young married people\r\nwho desire the best religious influences for their children are no\r\nlonger much interested in the theological or ecclesiastical differences\r\nof the various denominations, and they refuse to support them or do so\r\nunder protest and with an apathy which makes effective church work\r\nimpossible. As a result, there has been a strong movement in recent\r\nyears toward the consolidation of rural churches and for the\r\nestablishment of what are called \"community churches.\" Although much\r\neffort has been given toward getting denominational boards and leaders\r\nto form state federations for promoting inter-denominational comity, and\r\nalthough notable progress in this direction has been made in a few\r\nstates, particularly in Maine and Vermont, yet the chief impetus to the\r\ncommunity church movement has come from the people themselves, who have\r\ninsisted upon a combination of the local churches often in spite of\r\necclesiastical indifference or opposition. The lack of coal in 1918\r\ninduced many churches to hold their services together and in many cases\r\ngave an impetus to the idea of their permanent federation.\r\n\r\nThe term community church has come to be applied to various forms of\r\nchurches, but whatever its form, its fundamental purpose is the service\r\nof the community rather than the advancement of a particular\r\ndenomination and it admits all Christian people to its fellowship, in\r\ncontrast to the exclusiveness of the purely denominational church which\r\ninsists upon the importance of particular theological beliefs or systems\r\nof church government.\r\n\r\nAs the term is now used a \"community church\" may be a church definitely\r\naffiliated with some denomination, it may be a \"federated\" church, or a\r\n\"union\" church. The union church is unaffiliated with any religious\r\ndenomination. If it be the only church in a community, it is then a\r\ncommunity church, but if one or two others decline to unite, it is a\r\n_community church_ only in aspiration. It is this type of independent\r\nunion church, to which the term community church is most commonly\r\napplied by the laity, and such community churches have increased rapidly\r\nin the past five years as a protest of the people against denominational\r\ncompetition and inefficiency. These independent community churches have\r\nnow become so numerous in one or two states that they are holding state\r\nconventions. The question at once arises whether if they become\r\naffiliated in even the most nominal manner they will not soon constitute\r\nwhat will practically be another denomination and will fail to effect\r\nthe growth of Christian unity which they desire. On the other hand,\r\ndenominational leaders who are in entire sympathy with the abolishment\r\nof competition and the establishment of but one church in a rural\r\ncommunity where only one is needed, point out that the union church\r\nloses the advantages of affiliation with a body of churches which have\r\nregional and national boards and agencies for giving them assistance and\r\nsupport in their work. The history not only of church but of all sorts\r\nof secular organizations, indicates that sooner or later local\r\norganizations with common aims and purposes tend to get together in\r\nconventions and to establish federations through which they may unite\r\ntheir resources in maintaining agencies to promote the common cause.\r\nMost organizations, whether religious or secular, need the stimulus of\r\nassociation with kindred organizations devoted to the same purposes and\r\nthe help of expert supervision which can be secured only from state or\r\nnational bodies.\r\n\r\nThe \"federated church\" obviates this difficulty to a certain extent.\r\nEach of the federating churches maintains its own corporate identity and\r\nits affiliation with its own denomination, to which it sends its\r\ncontributions for benevolences and denominational work. The federating\r\nchurches form a joint organization for the employment of a minister and\r\nuse the same building, or use two buildings in common--sometimes one for\r\nchurch and one for Sunday school services or social purposes,--and the\r\nchurch is a community church for all practical purposes. In the long run\r\nthis usually results in a federated church finally affiliating with the\r\ndenomination which is preferred by the large majority of its membership\r\nand which is least objectionable to the minority.\r\n\r\nDenominational leaders, on the other hand, hold that neither \"union\" or\r\n\"federated\" churches will be permanently satisfactory, but that the\r\ncommunity church, though organized on the \"federated\" principle, should\r\nbe definitely affiliated with some one denomination, and that a single\r\ndenominational church which effectively serves the whole community may\r\nbe truly a \"community church.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever the outcome of this movement may be it has forced the\r\nrecognition of the fact that the religious welfare of the rural\r\ncommunity should be the first consideration and that denominational\r\nrelations must be conceived as a means rather than an end, as has\r\ncommonly been the case heretofore. When country people have learned the\r\nadvantages of consolidated schools and of coöperation in marketing, and\r\nhave developed the ability to work together in these and other phases of\r\ncommunity life, they are no longer content to waste their energies in\r\nmaintaining feeble churches, whose differences no longer command their\r\nloyalties, and they very naturally desire to bury their religious\r\ndifferences and to coöperate in the maintenance of a single church which\r\nwill give that inspiration and dynamic to all the life of the community\r\nwhich can be furnished only through the religious motive. So in religion\r\nas in other phases of life, the community idea is replacing the older\r\nindividualism.\r\n\r\nWe have already noted the change of emphasis in the work of the church\r\nfrom that of merely holding a preaching service for the personal\r\nsalvation of adults, to a greater reliance upon the power of religious\r\neducation through the Sunday school and other organizations of young\r\npeople. When Sunday schools were first started, a century or more ago,\r\nthey were bitterly opposed by many of the more conservative church\r\npeople. To-day they are a recognized part of all protestant churches,\r\nbut oddly enough their advancement has been due more largely to the work\r\nof the laity than to that of the clergy, although there can be no\r\nquestion that church membership is most largely recruited from the\r\nSunday schools. Thus in our survey of Tompkins County, New York, we\r\nfound that out of 175 persons admitted to the rural churches on\r\nconfession of faith, 61 of whom were adults and 114 children, 134 were\r\nprevious members of the Sunday school.\r\n\r\nThe rural Sunday school in the small church has the same difficulty as\r\ndoes the district school, in that it has too few scholars of\r\napproximately the same age to form classes of sufficient size to command\r\ntheir interest and enthusiasm. Likewise it is forced to depend upon\r\nuntrained and frequently-changing teachers. Although there has been a\r\nmarked advance in the grading and organization of Sunday schools and of\r\nthe literature for their study, yet there is a growing conviction that a\r\nperiod of twenty minutes a week is inadequate to secure effective\r\nreligious education. On the other hand, although the separation of\r\nchurch and state in this country prevents the giving of religious\r\ninstruction in our public schools, educators have come to recognize its\r\nimportance in the education of the child. As a result there is now a\r\ndefinite movement for the organization of week-day schools of religion.\r\nWhen these schools are conducted by trained teachers and their work is\r\nof an educational standard satisfactory to the public schools, the\r\npupils are given credit for their work toward promotion in the public\r\nschools. The State of New York has enacted definite legislation\r\npermitting the schools to dismiss those pupils whose parents so desire,\r\nfor a definite period each week when they may attend whatever school of\r\nreligious instruction their parents may designate, and for which the\r\npublic schools shall give credit when satisfactory as to educational\r\nmethods. Such week-day schools of religious instruction have been\r\ncarried on in some of our cities for several years, and at the present\r\ntime are being introduced into rural communities in various sections of\r\nthe country. Sometimes each church maintains its own school, but\r\ninasmuch as this movement is usually promoted by the inter-denominational\r\nSunday school associations the tendency is to secure the coöperation of\r\nall the protestant churches in establishing one school for the community.\r\nThis movement is still young, but if it makes the progress which now\r\nseems probable, it should be a powerful agency toward the elimination of\r\nweak churches. It makes possible the organization of graded classes of\r\nsufficient size so that a real group spirit and interest are created and\r\nthe instruction can be given with the same pedagogical efficiency as in\r\nthe public schools. Obviously the success of the movement will depend\r\nupon the degree to which it can command the support of the whole\r\ncommunity and it will thus tend to strengthen community life.\r\n\r\nA new attitude toward the social life of its people is also having a\r\nlarge influence upon the program of many rural churches. Formerly\r\nreligion was one thing and sociability was another, and the church felt\r\nno responsibility for the recreation of its people. Gradually church\r\nsuppers and sociables became customary, but they were held either to\r\nraise money or as a means for attracting outsiders into the fold. In the\r\ndays when money was scarce in the rural community it was often difficult\r\nto raise the pastor's salary. Much of his salary was paid in kind, and\r\nannual \"donation parties\" contributed a considerable share of his\r\nliving. But as markets developed and farmers came to sell most of their\r\nproducts for cash, money became more plentiful and it became evident\r\nthat no church can be maintained upon a sound business basis which does\r\nnot make up an annual budget and raise it by the direct contributions of\r\nits people. Putting the finances of the church on a business basis has\r\nremoved the need of church suppers for raising funds, but their social\r\nvalue has become so apparent that they are now held merely for the\r\nbetter acquaintance and enjoyment of the church people. In so far as the\r\nsocial life of the church has been consciously planned as a \"bait\" for\r\noutsiders to attract them into the church, it has, in the long run\r\nusually been ineffectual. Too often the motive has been so thinly veiled\r\nand the program of the social hour has been given such a religious\r\natmosphere that outsiders very naturally take a defensive attitude, and\r\nalthough they may enjoy the occasion they are perfectly aware of its\r\nulterior objective.\r\n\r\nRecently, however, the church has come to appreciate that play and\r\nrecreation are a normal and necessary part of the life of its people and\r\nthat it cannot abolish the saloon and condemn certain amusements without\r\nincurring a responsibility to provide, or to see that there is provided,\r\nsatisfying facilities for recreation and sociability. In short, it is\r\ncoming to recognize that a social program should be undertaken because\r\nit is a worthy service and a real need of the people and not as a mere\r\nmeans to other ends. Furthermore, where the church generously sponsors a\r\nsocial program which is enjoyed by all the people of the community,\r\nwithout thought of its being aimed at any proselyting, many of them come\r\nto take an increased interest in the strictly religious services and\r\nwork of the church.\r\n\r\nSo to-day many a rural church is holding community sings, its young\r\npeople are staging amateur dramatic entertainments, its boys have a\r\ntroop of boy scouts and the girls join the girl scouts or the camp-fire\r\ngirls, baseball and basketball teams are formed from the Sunday school\r\nclasses, the men have a club which meets once a month for the discussion\r\nof current topics and a supper, the women come together for sewing\r\nparties, and the whole people assemble for suppers and for the\r\ncelebration of national holidays and festival occasions. In a small\r\nvillage in western New York the four Sunday schools have recently formed\r\nan athletic association which has erected a one-story gymnasium in which\r\nthe boys can play basketball and all can find enjoyment.\r\n\r\nOne of the handicaps of the average country church is that its building\r\nis not adapted to social purposes, although the newer buildings are\r\nbeing constructed with better facilities. Sometimes this need is being\r\nmet by erecting a separate church house which is used for Sunday school\r\nand social purposes. Where there is more than one church it is\r\nfrequently felt that one building may serve the needs of all and so in\r\nmany communities the churches have united in the promotion of community\r\nbuildings to serve as social centers for all the people. Thus in its\r\nsocial as well as in its educational program the church finds that a\r\nsatisfactory social life cannot be secured through sectarian\r\ncompetition, but that by united effort the churches may meet the\r\ncommunity needs.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the past the chief duty of the country minister was to\r\npreach on Sunday, yet those most beloved and most successful in building\r\nup strong churches have won the hearts of their people more largely\r\nthrough their pastoral work, through their personal acquaintance and\r\ninfluence on the lives of families and individuals. Although a broader\r\neducational and social program is needed in the rural church, there is\r\nan equal opportunity for a larger service through a new sort of pastoral\r\nwork by the minister who can serve the community as a social worker.\r\nThere is an impression that there is no need for so-called social work,\r\nfor the expert assistance of the poor, the neglected, the delinquent,\r\nand the mentally defective, in most rural communities; that this may be\r\nnecessary for the city slums, but that there are but few such people in\r\nthe open country. But the recent work started during the war by the Home\r\nService of the local chapters of the American Red Cross and the work of\r\nvarious child welfare and health organizations have shown that country\r\npeople are not always aware of the needs of some of their not distant\r\nneighbors, and that there is a deal of service which might be given the\r\nmore unfortunate members of the average rural community which they are\r\nnot now receiving. The average rural community cannot support a paid\r\nsocial worker and needs but part of her time, while the county is\r\nusually too large an area for her to cover. Why should not the rural\r\nminister be qualified to do much of the family welfare work of his\r\ncommunity, calling in outside expert assistance when needed? What better\r\npastoral work could he do, and yet how many rural pastors are doing this\r\nsort of work in any intelligent sort of fashion, and how many families\r\nin need, outside of his own membership, would turn to the average rural\r\nminister for help? Dr. C. J. Galpin has well said of the rural minister\r\nthat \"he is the recognized community psychologist and sociologist.\" The\r\ntrouble is that although he is often so recognized, he is usually an\r\namateur rather than a professional. Obviously, as a doctor of souls, the\r\nvillage pastor should be the local \"social worker\" of every rural\r\ncommunity, but if he is to so serve he must first be trained so that he\r\ncan bring to bear a knowledge of social science upon the problems of the\r\nfamilies with which he deals. An average rural community can hardly\r\nafford more than one pastor with such qualifications, and it is evident\r\nthat he would need to give his whole time to one parish. Such a modern\r\nrepresentative of the old \"curé\" of the medieval parish could give real\r\nspiritual service to many a rural family which the average rural church\r\nnever reaches, and he would be a real father to his people.\r\n\r\nFinally, and most important, we must recognize that no other institution\r\ncan take the place of the Christian church as a source of those ideals\r\nof life which give religious sanction to loyalty to the common good--to\r\nthe community--rather than to self or particular interests. The ideals\r\nof its Founder who conceived the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood\r\nof man as the norm of human relationships, and who thought man's\r\nrelation to man should be the expression of his loyalty to their common\r\nFather, will ever furnish the strongest spiritual dynamic for the best\r\ncommunity life, for the whole community movement is but one means toward\r\nthe realization of His ideal of the Kingdom of God on earth. Indeed so\r\nkeen a mind as the late Professor Josiah Royce has interpreted the\r\nspirit of the early church and the ultimate aim of Christianity as that\r\nof \"the beloved community.\"[52] Though it may require new equipment and\r\nnew methods to meet the changed conditions of modern life, the mission\r\nof religion to interpret the highest values of life will ever make it\r\nthe motive force of community life, the heart of the community. As Dr.\r\nE. DeS. Brunner has well said, \"The aim of the country church movement\r\nis not to substitute anything for the Gospel. It is to assist in\r\nexpressing the best religion of the ages in terms of the best spirit of\r\nthe age.\"[53]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[51] \"The Evolution of the Country Community,\" p. 63.

In recent years\r\nbacteriology and medical science have revealed the causes of many\r\ndiseases and the manner in which they are spread. With a denser\r\npopulation and with more frequent contacts as a result of better\r\ntransportation, the possibility of contagion has very largely increased\r\nand we now appreciate that the health of the family--even of the rural\r\nfamily--cannot be maintained without attention to the health of the\r\ncommunity as a whole. Good health has become a responsibility of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe rapid growth of cities in the last fifty years has forced them to\r\ntake measures for the preservation of health, and public health\r\nadministration has become a distinct branch of medical science. It is\r\nthe health problems which have arisen in the congested sections of our\r\nlarge cities, and those which are due to a sedentary life or to\r\nunhealthful conditions of certain trades and industries, which have\r\nincited the discoveries of medical science and which have created a new\r\nattitude toward sanitation and hygiene among city people.\r\n\r\nThere has been a distinct change with regard to the attitude of society\r\ntoward health. A generation or two ago many people--particularly elderly\r\nfemales--were not ashamed of \"enjoying poor health,\" and a delicate\r\nphysique was regarded as rather incidental to the more highly cultured.\r\nTo-day, although we sympathize with the afflicted, society places a\r\npremium upon a sound physique. The importance of physical exercise, of\r\nrecreation and athletics for the development and maintenance of a sound\r\nbody are now much more fully appreciated than they were fifty years ago.\r\nWe are coming to understand that good health is largely due to habits of\r\npersonal hygiene which must be instilled by the home and the school, and\r\nthat without such habits the mere knowledge of sanitation and hygiene\r\nwill not be generally applied. This new emphasis upon physical fitness\r\nhas naturally received larger attention in the cities on account of the\r\nmore unfavorable conditions of city life, while the new knowledge and\r\nappreciation of the value of health has not been so constantly forced\r\nupon the attention of rural people.\r\n\r\nGradually we are coming to appreciate that we have an ethical\r\nresponsibility for good health, and it is even receiving a religious\r\nsanction, for we have come to know that the cause of evil behavior may\r\nbe due primarily to an unsound body rather than to a perverted soul. The\r\nchurch has ever ministered to the sick and has supported hospitals, but\r\nto-day it is commencing to advocate the prevention of disease through\r\nsanitation and hygiene, and to preach the religious duty of fostering\r\nhealth and preventing sickness.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal factors in the farmer's relative indifference to\r\nhealth measures is the fact that he has become accustomed to think that\r\nan outdoor life and isolation from other people give him an ability to\r\nwithstand sickness and he has rather gloried in his ability to throw off\r\nordinary ailments and to withstand the physical hardship which his work\r\noften demands. He can see how health conditions may need attention in\r\nthe city where people are crowded together, but he is not impressed that\r\nother causes make such diseases as typhoid and malaria much more\r\nprevalent in the open country, and that bad sanitation on a farm a mile\r\naway may cause sickness in his own family. American farmers have been\r\neducated on the nature and spread of disease by their experience with\r\nanimal diseases, such as bovine tuberculosis, hog cholera, and Texas\r\nfever. If they can be interested to utilize this knowledge in the care\r\nof the health of their own families, and if they will provide health\r\nfacilities for their own families equal to those which they feel\r\nnecessary for their livestock, health conditions on the farm will show\r\nrapid improvement. It is not that the farmer is indifferent to the\r\nhealth of his family, but he has been _forced_ to have his herd tested\r\nfor tuberculosis, and he faces the possibility of heavy losses if he\r\ndoes not have his hogs vaccinated for cholera, while he has not\r\nappreciated that by preventative agencies the better health of his wife\r\nand children may be insured and the cost of remedial treatment be\r\ngreatly lessened.\r\n\r\nThe purely economic aspects of sickness and disease have been a potent\r\nfactor in the health movement, particularly in cities. The vast sums\r\ninvested in life insurance have led progressive insurance companies into\r\nextensive campaigns for promoting public health so that their risks may\r\nbe reduced. Vast quantities of the best health literature have been\r\ndistributed by some of the industrial insurance companies and they have\r\ndone much to demonstrate the value of public health nursing by employing\r\nnurses who visit their policy holders. The extension of the insurance\r\nmethod to health insurance, and the adoption of insurance by large\r\ncorporations for their employees has furthered this general movement,\r\nand has revealed the tremendous economic losses due to preventable\r\nsickness and disease. The farmer has failed to appreciate the purely\r\neconomic handicap under which he labors as a result of sickness and the\r\nlack of adequate medical service and efficient public health\r\nadministration such as cities enjoy, because the cost of sickness is\r\ndistributed and is borne by each family and he has no means of knowing\r\nthe aggregate cost for the whole community. Were it possible for a rural\r\ncommunity to secure and have brought to its attention the total economic\r\nloss due to sickness in a given year and the proportion which might be\r\npreventable with a reasonable expenditure for better health facilities,\r\nits people would doubtless become as interested in better health\r\nadministration as does the employer in a large city industry, and the\r\ntrue economy of better health facilities would be apparent.\r\n\r\nFew concrete studies of the losses occasioned by sickness in rural\r\ncommunities have been made, but one of Dutchess County,[54] New York, in\r\n1915 well illustrates the conditions which would doubtless be found in\r\nmany another rural county. This survey covered five districts of the\r\ncounty with an aggregate population of about 11,800--most of which was\r\nrural territory. 1,600 cases of serious illness were found to have\r\noccurred during the year. \"Some 9,000 days were lost by men and women of\r\nworking age (15 to 54 years). Children lost 13,700 school days. On the\r\naverage this cost the community for each child at least 33 cents a day\r\nfor which it received no return. These two items safely represent a\r\nmoney loss of $20,000 to $25,000.\" As a result of the study it was\r\nestimated that the total money loss occasioned by sickness in a year\r\nwithin the whole county would be at least $412,000. \"Of the 1,600\r\npatients whose care has been analyzed in this report, 72 percent could\r\nhave been cared for adequately in their own homes had there been\r\navailable medical and nursing service. The remaining 28 percent (442\r\npatients) could not have been cared for adequately in their own homes\r\n... 24 percent of the patients secured no medical care. Many startling\r\ninstances of unnecessary and indefensible suffering and misery were\r\nfound.... Of the 113 women who went through childbirth in their homes,\r\nonly one had the continuous care of a graduate nurse, and only 18 had\r\nany service whatever from graduate visiting nurses. 35 percent of the\r\nchildren born came into the world under unfit conditions and\r\nsurroundings.\" Largely as a result of this study, Dutchess County now\r\nhas an efficient county health association through which a number of\r\npublic health nurses are employed, who visit all districts of the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious handicaps in maintaining the health of the rural\r\ncommunity is its frequent lack of medical service. The number of doctors\r\npractising in the open country was always inadequate, but in recent\r\nyears it has decreased until now many large sections are without any\r\nresident physician. The influenza epidemic of 1918, following the\r\nshortage of doctors during the war, revealed the plight of many a rural\r\ncommunity without medical service. The higher standards now required by\r\nmedical colleges and state licensing boards has resulted in a real\r\nshortage of physicians and the young men are not going into the country\r\nto practise. A recent study made by the New York State Department of\r\nHealth showed that in 20 rural counties 88 percent of the physicians had\r\nbeen practising over 25 years and only 3 percent less than ten years.\r\nThis means that most of the rural doctors in these counties have less\r\nthan ten years more to practise and that there is no indication that\r\ntheir places will be filled by younger men. In Manitoba one rural\r\nmunicipality has employed a physician on full time, and a recent act of\r\nthe New York legislature makes it possible for towns to employ\r\nphysicians. It seems probable that country people will be forced to\r\nemploy physicians on a salaried basis if they are to secure adequate\r\nmedical service. This does not necessarily mean, however, that the\r\nphysician will be employed by the local government. Industrial workers\r\nare now employing physicians on a salary and farmers' organizations are\r\nemploying salaried veterinarians. Why cannot a local health association\r\nbe formed to employ a physician, whose job it will be to keep its people\r\nwell?\r\n\r\nTwo factors prevent the larger use of physicians now available. Chief of\r\nthese is the cost. Farmers handle relatively less actual money than\r\ntownsmen, and their income is less frequent so that they have less on\r\nhand, while the cost of medical attendance is necessarily higher in the\r\ncountry. Fear of running up a bill deters many a farm woman from calling\r\na doctor, when one call might prevent many more later on. The farm home\r\ntends to employ a physician only for serious sickness, rather than as a\r\nmedical adviser who may forestall illness. Another difficulty is one of\r\nthe physician's own making. The experience is far too common that in\r\ncases of immediate need when the family doctor cannot be located,\r\ndoctors will refuse to attend a case on account of so-called\r\n\"professional courtesy.\" It is time that public opinion be aroused so\r\nthat such cases be brought to the attention of county medical societies\r\nwith sufficient public opinion to force them to take suitable action.\r\nThe ethics of every profession must be shaped to meet the needs of those\r\nit serves as well as the pocketbooks of its members.\r\n\r\nLack of medical attendance is most serious for the farm mother during\r\nconfinement, and the mortality of rural mothers during childbirth, as\r\nshown by the investigations of the U. S. Children's Bureau, is an\r\nindictment of our supposed civilization. When we learn that in a\r\nhomesteading county in Montana there were 12.7 deaths of mothers per\r\n1,000 births, which is twice the rate for the United States as a whole,\r\nwhich is higher than that of fifteen foreign countries for which\r\nstatistics were available in 1915, we face a condition which cannot be\r\nneglected. When we find that in Wisconsin this rate was but 6 per 1,000,\r\nand that 68 percent were attended by physicians, and in Kansas it was\r\nbut 2.9 per thousand and 95 percent had physicians, while in Montana\r\nonly 47 percent were attended, loss of life due to isolation and lack of\r\nmedical care is apparent. In sparsely settled regions the solution of\r\nthis problem seems to demand the provision of local maternity hospitals,\r\nfor the difficulty is primarily one of isolation.\r\n\r\nSince medical science has shown that sparkling spring water may carry\r\nthe deadly typhoid germ as a result of distant contamination, that wells\r\nare frequently contaminated by nearby privies or barn yards, that\r\nmalaria is carried by mosquitoes, and that the house fly may carry\r\ntyphoid fever and intestinal diseases of infants, we have come to\r\nappreciate that isolation and pure country air do not insure freedom\r\nfrom infection, and that sanitation is as important on the farm as in\r\nthe city. Indeed the transmission of disease by flies is much easier on\r\nthe farm, for too often the manure pile where they multiply is not far\r\nfrom the house, while in many a city the smaller number of horses and\r\nthe cleaning of manure from the streets prevents their increase. The\r\nsanitation of the farm home thus becomes a very large factor in the\r\nhealth of the rural community. Surveys made by health officers in recent\r\nyears have shown the general need of better sanitary provisions and also\r\nthe possibility of the direct benefits secured from their improvement.\r\nIn Indiana the State Board of Health surveyed nine typical rural\r\ncounties taking only the homes on farms and in unincorporated villages.\r\nThe average score of 6,124 rural homes in these nine counties was but\r\n56.2 percent, the average for individual counties varying from 43 to 61\r\npercent. In 1914, 1915, and 1916, the U. S. Public Health Service made\r\nsanitary surveys of 51,544 farm homes in 15 rural counties scattered\r\nthroughout the United States, but mostly in the South. Its report[55]\r\nstates that only 1.22 percent of these farm homes were equipped for a\r\nreally sanitary disposal of human excreta, while in one county in\r\nAlabama less than 20 percent of the farm homes had toilets of any kind.\r\n\"Sixty-eight percent of the water supply used for drinking or culinary\r\npurposes was obviously exposed to dangerous contamination from privy\r\ncontents\"; and only 32.88 percent of the houses were effectively\r\nscreened against flies. A very considerable improvement in farm\r\nsanitation has resulted from the educational campaigns conducted during\r\nthe past decade, but effective rural sanitation awaits the employment of\r\npublic health officials who will convince the people of each local\r\ncommunity of their individual responsibility for the health conditions\r\non their own farms and of their common liability for the health of each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWith the above conditions in mind, let us now consider the agencies for\r\nhealth conservation in rural communities. We have already seen that the\r\nold-fashioned country doctor is rapidly disappearing. With better\r\ntransportation now available it seems probable that physicians will live\r\nin the larger village centers, but with telephone communication and the\r\nautomobile it should be possible to secure as prompt medical attendance.\r\nWe may as well recognize that many a rural community is too small a unit\r\nto support a resident physician and that if satisfactory medical\r\ntreatment is to be secured we shall have to have better hospital and\r\nclinical facilities so that the time of the physician can be economized\r\nand frequent attention can be given.\r\n\r\nMost rural townships have a local board of health and health officer,\r\nwho is charged with reporting births and deaths and with the enforcement\r\nof quarantines against contagious diseases, but it is notorious that\r\nthese local health officials are rarely efficient or take any leadership\r\nin the betterment of public health. Ordinarily the health officer\r\nreceives little if any pay, and is a resident physician who is not\r\ninclined to antagonize his own clients when the enforcement of health\r\nregulations would meet their opposition. Students of rural health\r\nproblems are now fairly agreed that the only means of securing efficient\r\nadministration of public health regulations in rural communities is by\r\nthe employment of a full time county health officer, working under a\r\ncounty board of health, who will have the same general duties as the\r\nhealth officers in our cities. Local health officers would be retained,\r\nbut their work would be under the supervision of the county health\r\nofficer and would have the benefit not only of his support and\r\nencouragement, but also of his superior technical training. If a county\r\nsuperintendent is necessary for our schools, a county health officer is\r\nequally necessary for the supervision of public health, and several\r\nstates have enacted legislation requiring or permitting the employment\r\nof county health officers. The county is usually the best unit for rural\r\nhealth administration.[56] The county health officer would have\r\nlaboratory facilities for the examination of drinking water, and samples\r\nof blood, urine, or sputum for the detection of disease, and would give\r\ndirection for the taking of samples which might be sent to the\r\nlaboratories of the state department of health for the examination of\r\nthose specimens for which his laboratory was not equipped. He would\r\nhave general supervision of the medical examination of school children.\r\nIn numerous ways he would promote better means for health conservation,\r\nas can be done by one who has had special training for such work and who\r\nis giving his whole time and thought to its problems.\r\n\r\nAlthough the county health officer is necessary for the administration\r\nof the technical aspects of public health administration, the most\r\nimportant gains in the health of the rural community will come through\r\nthe personal education of its people on matters of hygiene and\r\nsanitation. This is the field of public health nurses, and I believe\r\nthat the records of their work in rural communities will show that they\r\nhave done more for health education than any other one agency. A decade\r\nago trained visiting nurses were practically unknown in rural\r\ncommunities. In 1914 the American Red Cross first organized its Town and\r\nCountry Nursing Service and coöperated with a few rural communities in\r\nsupervising the work of trained public health nurses, but relatively few\r\nplaces employed rural nurses prior to the war. The county tuberculosis\r\nsocieties also employed visiting nurses who worked throughout a whole\r\ncounty and whose work inevitably created a demand for visiting nurses\r\nfor a more general service. The shortage of physicians during the war\r\nand the influenza epidemic of 1918 revealed the need for rural nurses\r\nand since the war the local chapters of the American Red Cross, which is\r\ndevoting much of its attention to public health work, have employed\r\nhundreds of rural public health nurses.\r\n\r\nThe success of school nurses in the cities has led to their employment\r\nin the smaller towns, and now county school nurses are being employed in\r\nindividual counties in several states, and in other states school\r\nnurses are employed by townships or jointly by several rural school\r\ndistricts. Wisconsin and Ohio have recently enacted laws compelling\r\nevery county to employ at least one public health nurse, and a dozen or\r\nmore states have passed legislation making the employment of county or\r\nlocal nurses optional. Under whatever auspices they are employed, rural\r\npublic health nurses have found that their most effective work may be\r\ndone at first in connection with the schools. Medical examination of\r\nschool children is now required in many states, but unless it is\r\nfollowed up by some one who will see the parents and encourage them to\r\nsecure the necessary medical or dental treatment, the results of these\r\nexaminations are often disappointing.\r\n\r\nA most interesting and instructive account of the work done by a county\r\nschool nurse during the first year of her work in typical Minnesota\r\ncounty has been given by Miss Amalia M. Bengtson, superintendent of\r\nschools of Renville County:\r\n\r\n      \"Renville County is prosperous; there are few poor people,\r\n      no child is underfed and no one wilfully neglected, yet our\r\n      tabulated report shows an appalling amount of physical\r\n      defectiveness. Out of our school population of six thousand\r\n      we examined five thousand children, and found four thousand\r\n      and ninety-five defective, testifying that 81 percent of the\r\n      children were defective. This seems almost unbelievable, and\r\n      yet it does not tell the whole story, for I could take you\r\n      to school after school where there was 100 percent\r\n      defectiveness, where we sent a notice to every parent in\r\n      that school. Yet, as I said before, Renville County is a\r\n      prosperous county, and we have every reason to believe that\r\n      conditions in Renville County to-day are the same as in\r\n      other counties where a health survey has been taken. The\r\n      percentages of the defectiveness found were: teeth, 55\r\n      percent; nose, 40 percent; throat, 66 percent; eyes, 22\r\n      percent; ears, 17 percent; malnutrition, 16 percent;\r\n      nervous disorder, 16 percent; neck glands, 14 percent; skin,\r\n      13 percent; and general appearance, 12 per cent.\"[57]\r\n\r\n      In reply to the question, \"What of it? What good came of the\r\n      health survey?\" Miss Bengtson says: \"Our records show that\r\n      about one thousand of the children examined were taken to\r\n      see either a doctor or a dentist, or both, the first year.\r\n      Parents who at first opposed the work are fully convinced\r\n      that a county nurse should be a permanent worker among us\r\n      when they see how much their children have been benefited by\r\n      a little medical help.\r\n\r\n      \"Besides examining the children, the nurse has been a great\r\n      factor in bringing about a general education for better\r\n      health. In our county to-day you are behind the times if you\r\n      do not know what adenoids are and the havoc bad tonsils can\r\n      bring; why eye strain is so prevalent and how to prevent it;\r\n      why teeth should be taken care of; why we should drink\r\n      plenty of water and eat the proper kind of food; what kind\r\n      of clothing is best to wear, and why we should not wear too\r\n      heavy and too much clothing while indoors (we have induced\r\n      some little boys to remove one coat and three sweaters while\r\n      in school); why we need to be clean, etc.\r\n\r\n      \"Another great service the nurse rendered us was to bring\r\n      about a veritable epidemic of school-house improvement. She\r\n      proved that the physical condition of the school-house was\r\n      reflected in the physical condition of the children. For\r\n      example, a poorly lighted and badly ventilated school-house\r\n      always housed children with eye strain and nervous disorder,\r\n      and in a school-house having ill-fitting desks were children\r\n      of poor posture.\r\n\r\n      \"During the summer of that first year the nurse was with us,\r\n      we conducted so-called 'baby clinics' in the county, one in\r\n      every township and one in each village. We urged the mothers\r\n      to bring their children below school age to the clinics, and\r\n      much the same kind of examination was given them as was\r\n      given the children of school age. We found that 60 percent\r\n      of the children of pre-school age were defective.\"\r\n\r\nThis is but a sample of the work and experience of hundreds of rural\r\nnurses and shows how the nurse is a health teacher in the most effective\r\nmanner, for she gets into the homes and gives personal help in bringing\r\nabout better health. She uses the demonstration method in health work\r\njust as the home demonstration agent does with food, clothing, and home\r\nmanagement. Furthermore, when the nurse is devoted to her work--and most\r\nnurses are or they would not stick to so hard a job--she becomes\r\nendeared to the people just as does the family doctor, for the help she\r\ngives in cases of sickness, accident, and childbirth, when she is of\r\ninvaluable service to isolated homes who can secure no other help. A\r\nslip of a girl--though a well-trained nurse--who commenced work in a\r\nnearby community was introduced to her new work with two confinement\r\ncases and an accident case the first day, for none of which was a\r\nphysician obtainable. The Red Cross Nurse in my own county has spent\r\nmany a night in a farm home in order to get sufficiently acquainted with\r\nparents to induce them to allow her to have needed treatment given to\r\ntheir children, and when the parents come to realize the benefit which\r\ntheir children have received from operations on tonsils or adenoids, the\r\nfitting of glasses, and similar services, and appreciate the handicap\r\nwhich such defects would have been to them through life, the nurse has a\r\nwarm place in their hearts and they eagerly support her work.\r\n\r\nOne of the difficulties of the average country doctor is his lack of\r\nfacilities for the expert diagnosis of disease and for the care of\r\npatients who need to be kept under observation and given supervised\r\ncare. Medical science has become highly specialized. The human body is\r\nso complicated and wonderful a mechanism that we no longer can expect\r\nany one man to be expert on all its ailments. If one desires to secure\r\nthe best medical service, he goes to a large city hospital or a\r\nsanitarium, where various specialists can be consulted and where\r\nlaboratory facilities are available for their aid. In the average\r\nvillage or country town both specialists and laboratories are lacking\r\nand the physician is dependent on his own knowledge and resources. The\r\nwell-trained physician who appreciates his own limitations and that he\r\ncannot give many of his more difficult cases the care they ought to\r\nhave, sends those who can afford it to the nearest hospital, and does\r\nthe best he can for the others, but he is keenly aware that he cannot\r\nalways give them the treatment they should have and he envies his city\r\ncolleague who can take his patients to specialists for examination.\r\n\r\nIt is a fear of this professional isolation which causes the average\r\nyoung doctor to start his practice in the city where he has better\r\nfacilities, and which is largely responsible for the small number of\r\nyoung doctors in rural counties. It is, of course, impossible to have a\r\nhospital in every hamlet, but it is possible to have a good hospital and\r\nlaboratories at every county seat or small city center, so that there\r\nwill be at least one such medical center in a county. Legislation has\r\nnow been enacted in several states making it possible for counties to\r\nsupport a public hospital just as the larger cities have done for many\r\nyears. Here clinics may be held from time to time, to which eminent\r\nspecialists may be brought for the diagnosis of different cases, to the\r\nadvantage of both patient and physician. It is quite impossible for a\r\nbusy country doctor to maintain a private laboratory and to provide\r\nhimself with all the expensive equipment for making examination and\r\ntests of blood, sputum, urine, for X-ray examinations, etc., but the\r\nhospital may have all this equipment at his service.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important features of the domestic program of the\r\nAmerican Red Cross is the promotion of so-called \"Health Centers,\" a\r\nmovement which is also sponsored by the American Medical Association and\r\nother national health organizations. Such a health center may include a\r\nhospital with well equipped laboratories and clinical facilities, or it\r\nmay be nothing more than a room in a small village, equipped with scales\r\nfor weighing children, with first aid kits for accident cases, and used\r\nfor occasional clinics for the examination of babies and children of\r\npre-school age and for classes in home nursing or first aid; but every\r\ncommunity of any size should have some place which will be a\r\nheadquarters for its local health Service, equipped as may be most\r\npracticable to meet its needs, according to the size of the community.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough the local physicians, who would be most helped by such\r\nimproved health facilities and whose practice would be benefited by\r\nthem, are often their chief opponents. The leaders in the medical world,\r\nwho are keen for all practicable means of improving the public health,\r\nheartily support the \"health center\" movement.\r\n\r\nWe are coming to the time when the maintenance of health will be\r\nregarded as a public function just as education is now provided for all\r\nthe people and supported by them. That country people are alive to the\r\nneed of better health facilities is shown by a resolution of the recent\r\n(February, 1922) Agricultural Conference called by President Harding at\r\nWashington. Its committee on farm population reported:\r\n\r\n      \"The safeguarding of the health of the people in the open\r\n      country is a first consideration. Any program that looks\r\n      toward the proper safeguarding of health must include\r\n      adequate available facilities for the people in the open\r\n      country in the way of hospitals, clinics, laboratories,\r\n      dispensaries, nurses, physicians, and health officers. This\r\n      committee endorses the growing tendency through public\r\n      agencies to maintain the health of the people by means of\r\n      these facilities and agencies.\"\r\n\r\nThe life of rural people in America is no longer threatened by the\r\ninvasion of human foes, but it is constantly threatened by disease. It\r\nwould seem that the first public concern would be for the maintenance of\r\nthe health--the very life--of its people, but as yet we have given much\r\nless thought to health than to education. The New York State Department\r\nof Health has as its slogan: \"Public health is purchasable. Within\r\nnatural limitations any community can determine its own death rate.\"\r\nThis is no longer theory, but can be demonstrated by official mortality\r\nstatistics. The death rate has declined more rapidly in cities than in\r\nrural communities because the cities have given more adequate support to\r\npublic health organization. The rural community has all the natural\r\nadvantages in its favor and will ever have the most healthful\r\nenvironment, but it must recognize that if preventable disease--with all\r\nits attendant evils to the family and to the individual--is to be\r\nreduced, this can be accomplished only through education and public\r\nhealth agencies. Better health is a matter of the hygiene of the home\r\nand the individual, but it has also become a concern of the common\r\nlife--a community problem.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[54] \"A Study of Sickness in Dutchess County, New York.\" State Charities\r\nAid Association, New York City.\r\n\r\n[55] L.

Opportunities for enjoyment seem\r\nmore available in the towns and cities and are therefore a leading cause\r\nof the great exodus. Economic prosperity and good wages are not alone\r\nsufficient to keep people on farms and in villages if their income will\r\nnot purchase the satisfactions they desire. To a certain extent many of\r\nthese advantages of the town and city can be brought to the rural\r\ncommunity, but only when country people come to appreciate and develop\r\nthose forms of play and recreation which are possible and adapted to\r\ntheir conditions, and when they are willing to afford ample facilities\r\nand opportunity for the play of their children, will the lure of the\r\ncity be checked. With such a changed attitude the rural community need\r\nhave no fear of the competition of the city. It may not be able to have\r\nas fine commercial amusements, but it can have the best sort of play and\r\nrecreation at small cost, for which the cities incur large expense.\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiar need for a better understanding of the place of play\r\nand recreation in the open country at the present time. Formerly large\r\nfamilies gave better opportunity for the children of one family to play\r\ntogether, and there were more children of similar ages at the district\r\nschool of the neighborhood. To-day with farms farther apart and fewer\r\nchildren, farm children do not have sufficient opportunity to play\r\ntogether in groups. The better opportunity for group play and team\r\ngames is one of the advantages of the consolidated school which has been\r\ntoo little appreciated.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that one of the obvious necessities for the economic\r\nprogress of agriculture is that its business be conducted on a\r\ncoöperative basis. The chief obstacle to coöperation is the\r\nindividualism of the farmer. The training of boys and girls in team\r\ngames, in which they learn loyalty to the group and to subordinate\r\nthemselves to the winning of the team, will do much to change this\r\nattitude. Boys who play baseball and basketball together, who are\r\nassociated in boy scouts and agricultural clubs, will be much quicker to\r\ncoöperate, for they grow up with an attitude of loyalty to the team\r\ngroup as well as to their own family.\r\n\r\nAgain, the awkwardness and self-consciousness of the country youth in\r\ncomparison with his city cousin is due to no inherent inferiority, for\r\nin a few years he often out-strips him, but it is the direct result of\r\nhis lack of social contacts. Personality develops through social life,\r\nthrough the give and take of one personality with another, through\r\nimitation, and the acquirement of a natural ease of association with\r\nothers. The country boy and girl who has had the advantage of\r\nassociation with larger groups in the consolidated school or high school\r\ntends to become quite the social equal of the city child.\r\n\r\nHeretofore many people, and particularly farm people, have regarded play\r\nand recreation for adults as more or less frivolous or unnecessary,\r\nwhile for children play has been used as an award for good conduct or\r\nhard work, but it has by no means been deemed a necessary phase of the\r\nchild's life. If Johnnie does all his chores or if Mary washes the\r\ndishes and dusts the furniture faithfully, the opportunity for play is\r\nheld up as a reward for services rendered; but that time for play and\r\nproper kinds of play are essential for a child's education has only\r\nrecently been established by the students of child psychology and is\r\nnot, as yet, generally appreciated either by parents or teachers.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that this is the \"age of the child,\" in that our\r\ncivilization is more largely shaped by a desire to give our children the\r\nbest possible advantages. We have come to appreciate, thanks to the\r\ninsight of such philosophers as John Fiske,[58] that the advancement of\r\nthe human race has been very largely due to the prolongation of the\r\nperiod of infancy. Ordinarily we think of play as an attribute of\r\nchildhood, but as an incident rather than as a fundamental reason for\r\nthe prolongation of childhood. Most modern students of child psychology,\r\nhowever, will take the view of Karl Gross,[59] an authority on the play\r\nof man and animals, who says: \"Children do not play because they are\r\nyoung; they are young in order that they may play.\" Play is a normal\r\nprocess of the child's growth through spontaneous activity. Joseph Lee,\r\nthe president of the Playground and Recreation Association of America,\r\ngoes so far as to say: \"Play is thus the essential part of education. It\r\nis nature's prescribed course. School is invaluable in forming the child\r\nto meet actual social opportunities and conditions. Without the school,\r\nhe will not grow up to fit our institutions. Without play he will not\r\ngrow up at all.[60]\r\n\r\nI do not mean that a child should have no responsibilities, for that is\r\nthe misfortune of the city child, but it is important to recognize the\r\ntruth of old adage that \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,\"\r\nwhich modern psychology has given a scientific basis. One of the most\r\nfundamental needs for the promotion of play in rural communities is to\r\nsecure a new attitude toward it on the part of many parents. Too\r\nfrequently--and alas, often from necessity--children are compelled to do\r\ntoo much farm labor. Agriculture is still a family industry, and very\r\noften on the poorer farms the older children seem to be considered\r\nchiefly as an economic asset. Overwork and little or no time to satisfy\r\nthe innate tendency of children to play, inevitably produces a dislike\r\nof farm life and is one of the most obvious reasons why many of them\r\nleave the farm as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMany parents have forgotten how to play and have lost the \"feel\" of it.\r\nIt is important for them to play themselves in order to appreciate the\r\nneeds of their children, and to have a real sympathy with them. Picnics,\r\nplay festivals, and sociables, at which every one is compelled to \"get\r\ninto the game,\" are valuable for this purpose. Many a man recovers his\r\nyouth in a picnic baseball game. Others have never had much play in\r\ntheir own lives and do not appreciate its value for the best development\r\nof their children. Play festivals or demonstrations and local athletic\r\nmeets in which their children participate may appeal to their parental\r\npride. Furthermore, when such play days are community affairs, they give\r\nthe sanction of public opinion to the games played and to those\r\nparticipating in them. The play idea is popularized.\r\n\r\n_Play in the Home._--Although the small family does not furnish\r\nopportunity for group games, which are necessary for the satisfaction\r\nboth of children and adults, yet the movement for better play facilities\r\nfor the community should not overlook the fact that the home is the\r\nfundamental social institution of rural life and that play and\r\nrecreation in the home are essential to its success and happiness. Home\r\ngames bind the family together, and parents who play with their\r\nchildren find it much easier to secure and maintain their confidence.\r\nThe community may well give attention to the encouragement of games and\r\nplay in the homes as well as in the community gatherings. We need a\r\ndefinite movement on the part of pastors, teachers, and especially by\r\nsuch organizations as granges and farm and home bureaus for the\r\npromotion of play by young and old in the farm home.\r\n\r\n_Influence of the Automobile._--One of the values of the automobile is\r\nthat by its use many a farmer has been given a new realization of the\r\nvalue of recreation. The new desire for recreation thus created is a\r\ngreat gain for farm life. There is no reason why the farmer and his\r\nfamily should not have as much enjoyment of life as town and city\r\npeople, and if they cannot, then only the poorer class of people will\r\nremain on the farms. Occasionally one hears a commercial salesman or\r\nsome city business man decrying the effect of automobiles on farmers,\r\nclaiming that they are neglecting their work while chasing around the\r\ncountry having a good time. Doubtless in occasional instances this is as\r\ntrue of the farmer as it is of the townsman, but such farmers will soon\r\ncome to their senses or get off the farm, and even were there a general\r\ntendency of this sort in some communities it must be regarded as the\r\ntemporary excitement of a new experience. On the other hand, the\r\nbreaking down of the old stolidity which dominated many a farmer who had\r\nbecome so accustomed to work day in and day out that he was hardly happy\r\nwhen he had a chance for recreation, and the creation of a wholesome\r\ndesire for a larger experience and more association with others, is one\r\nof the largest gains in country life and will not only raise the\r\nstandards of living, but will be a potent incentive for better\r\nagricultural methods. There can be no progress without a certain amount\r\nof dissatisfaction. Contentedness has its virtues, but it may\r\ndegenerate into inertia and the death of all desire for better life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the automobile and trolley have made it possible for\r\nfarm people to easily reach the towns and there attend movies and other\r\ncommercial amusements and to take part in the social life of the town\r\nand city. This may weaken the social life of the rural community, and it\r\nalso tends to make rural people imitate the forms of play, recreation,\r\nand social life of the city, which are not necessarily best suited to\r\nrural life. When rural people come to appreciate that those forms of\r\nplay and recreation which are native or are adapted to the country have\r\nmany advantages over those of their city cousins, and in many ways may\r\nhave higher values and satisfactions, they will give more heed to\r\ndeveloping those which are most suitable for their enjoyment. Because\r\nvarious kinds of expensive play apparatus are desirable for the small\r\nplayground of the city, which is crowded with hundreds of children, is\r\nno reason why similar apparatus should be thought necessary for the\r\nschool-yard of the rural school. Many of the present tendencies of\r\nrecreation in cities are but revivals of rural customs which are\r\nreceiving new recognition because they appeal to that which is innate in\r\nhuman nature. What is community singing but a variation of the\r\nold-fashioned singing school? Folk-dancing originated in the country as\r\nan expression of the activities of every-day life, and should be\r\nencouraged everywhere. Dramatics and pageantry are native to the\r\ncountryside. The fair and festival are rural institutions.\r\n\r\n_Commercial Amusements; Moving Pictures._--A certain form of recreation\r\nmay be secured through amusements which involve mere passive\r\nparticipation upon the part of the spectators, as in various\r\nentertainments, dramatics, etc. As long as those giving the\r\nentertainment are local people, friends or relatives, the audience takes\r\na more or less sympathetic part in the performance and is not actuated\r\nsolely by the desire to purchase pleasurable sensations as is the case\r\nwith commercial amusements. I mean by commercial amusements those which\r\nare operated solely for profit, whose advantages the individual\r\npurchases for his own pleasure rather than with any idea of\r\nparticipating in a group activity. Commercial amusements have their\r\nplace and may be of great benefit, but they are largely an\r\nindividualistic form of enjoyment and tend to make the spectator\r\nincreasingly dependent upon passive pleasurable sensations, and do not\r\nhave the social value of those forms of play in which one actively\r\nparticipates as a member of a group.\r\n\r\nAlthough commercial amusements have these limitations, yet they have\r\nvery real values which might be secured for many rural communities if\r\nthey were operated on a coöperative basis by the people themselves\r\nrather than merely for profit by an individual. Motion pictures are now\r\nthe most popular form of commercial amusement and have unlimited\r\npossibilities when operated for the good of the community rather than\r\nfor profit alone. It is now possible to secure relatively cheap\r\nprojection outfits and electric plants, so that many small communities\r\nare now operating their own motion picture shows. In many places this is\r\none of the leading attractions at the community building and is a source\r\nof revenue for its maintenance. In such places the motion picture\r\nentertainment is becoming a sort of family affair, and when it can be so\r\noperated as to secure the attendance of the family as a group the\r\nobjectionable features will soon disappear. Indeed, there is a\r\nwell-organized effort on the part of certain motion picture firms to\r\nsupply films for just this type of entertainments. Moreover, the\r\npicture show may possibly be supplemented with other features which will\r\nmake a more attractive evening's entertainment, especially in small\r\nplaces where it is practicable to operate but one show during an\r\nevening. During the war community singing was tried at the opening and\r\nbetween reels in many movie houses with conspicuous success, and should\r\nbe encouraged wherever suitable leadership can be secured. The speeches\r\nof the \"four-minute\" men were also an innovation which might well be\r\ntried further in a modified form. Would not a four-minute speech on some\r\ncurrent topic by a live speaker, given in an uncontroversial manner, be\r\na welcome feature of the movie show between reels, and an effective\r\nmeans of educating public opinion? The community orchestra or community\r\nband might well receive encouragement and financial aid by occasional\r\nprograms at the community movies.\r\n\r\n_Dramatics and Pageantry._--In the last few years amateur dramatics have\r\nbecome increasingly popular in rural communities. The \"little country\r\ntheater\" idea has caught the attention of rural people, and seems\r\ndestined in one form or another to become a rural institution. Amateur\r\ndramatics are one of the most enjoyable and wholesome forms of\r\nrecreation. The actors not only have a deal of fun as well as hard work,\r\nbut real acting involves putting one's self into the part and gaining an\r\nunderstanding of various types of people and social situations which is\r\na most liberal education. The audience, on the other hand, takes a\r\nparticular interest in the acting of its children, friends, and\r\nrelatives, and it enters into the spirit of the play much more fully\r\nthan when seeing professional actors. The amateur dramatic club tends to\r\nbecome a community organization in which the people have a real pride\r\nand for which they develop a loyalty which affords it a peculiar\r\nopportunity and responsibility for portraying various problems and\r\nphases of life, giving not only enjoyment but a finer and deeper\r\nappreciation of human relationships.\r\n\r\nFor special occasions the historical pageant is not only a most\r\ndelightful entertainment but is one of the best means of arousing\r\ncommunity pride and spirit. The pageant grips both actors and audience\r\nwith a common loyalty to their forefathers. Such an historical picture\r\nof the development of a community brings to its people an appreciation\r\nof their common heritage and they come to a new realization of their\r\npresent comforts and their responsibility for the community's future.\r\nAll sorts and conditions of people will work together in a pageant and\r\nenjoy the association. Any rural community which really makes up its\r\nmind to do so can produce an historical pageant of its own, which will\r\ngive new meaning and inspiration to the common life.[61]\r\n\r\n_Play in the School._--The school is commencing to realize the\r\nimportance of play as a phase of education, but in many cases the\r\none-room country school has too few children of the same age to make it\r\npossible for them to play together with much satisfaction. School\r\nconsolidation is essential for better play. The grounds of most one-room\r\nschools are ill-adapted to play and it is not always practicable to have\r\nsufficient land attached to them for a suitable playground. It has been\r\nassumed that children know how to play, but such is by no means always\r\nthe case. They have the desire to play, but if they have not had\r\nopportunity to play with others, the forms of their play may be very\r\nlimited. Herein is the opportunity for supervision by the teacher, who\r\nmay teach them new plays and games, may uphold the code of play, and may\r\nsee that all have opportunity to participate. Obviously the teachers\r\nthemselves need training for this which they have not had in the past.\r\nNew York State has provided that any school district or combination of\r\nseveral school districts may employ a supervisor of physical training,\r\ntowards whose salary the state will contribute half up to $600 per\r\nannum, who will assist the teachers in developing physical training and\r\nplay in their schools. Similar plans are being adopted in other states.\r\nMaryland has a state-wide athletic league organized by counties. The\r\nchildren of each school are given physical tests, and recognition by\r\nbuttons and medals is given for the attainment of definite standards of\r\nphysical development and prowess, graduated according to age and sex.\r\nAthletic meets are held by the schools of each county, and the winners\r\nthen compete in a state-wide meet.[62]\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the country the schools of a community, township, or\r\ncounty are now holding play days or play festivals, with which is\r\nusually a picnic, at which children and parents from the whole\r\ncountryside get together for a day of real recreation, and which have a\r\nlarge influence in winning the support of their patrons for the play\r\nactivities fostered by the schools.[63]\r\n\r\n_Boys' and Girls' Organizations._--Probably a larger impetus to the best\r\ntypes of play for country boys and girls has been given by such\r\norganizations as the Young Men's Christian Association, the Young\r\nWomen's Christian Association, the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts, the\r\nCamp Fire Girls, and the Boys' and Girls' Clubs fostered by the\r\nextension departments of the state agricultural colleges and the U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, than by any other agencies. Each of these\r\norganizations has a program of children's activities involving both\r\nrecreation and education, as well as a definite effort for character\r\nbuilding. They are invaluable allies of the home, the school, and the\r\nchurch, for they are the boys' and girls' own organizations and meet\r\ntheir desire for group activities. Just which one or how many of them\r\nare needed in any one community is a local problem, and it is\r\nimpracticable to here attempt any evaluation of their particular\r\nadvantages. Suffice it to say that every rural community which can find\r\nsuitable leadership should have such an organization of boys or girls,\r\nand will find the assistance of the state and national headquarters of\r\nthese movements of the greatest help in the development of a local\r\nprogram of play and recreation.[64]\r\n\r\n_The Church and Play._--We have already noted (page 133) a changing\r\nattitude on the part of the rural church toward play and recreation.[65]\r\nIn the past it has too often been simply a negative condemnation of the\r\nso-called \"worldly amusements,\" with no effort to understand the normal\r\ncravings of human nature which they satisfy or to furnish any\r\nsatisfactory substitute for them. It is true that socials of the older\r\nclasses in the Sunday school and of the young people's societies have\r\ndone much for the sociable life of the country, but very often they have\r\nfailed to interest those who would be most benefited by them. Recently,\r\nhowever, church leaders are actively encouraging rural churches to\r\ndevelop such programs of play and recreation as may be necessary to meet\r\nthe needs of their communities. The Sunday schools are organizing\r\nbaseball teams and baseball leagues, and are promoting \"through-the-week\"\r\nactivities of organized classes. A majority of the troops of Boy Scouts\r\nare affiliated with churches, and scouting is becoming a recognized means\r\nfor the direction of the church's recreational work for boys.\r\n\r\nJust how far the rural church should go in affording facilities for play\r\nand recreation, is a local problem and it is difficult to generalize as\r\nto the duty of the church in this field. If there is but one church in\r\nthe community, or there is a community church, and other agencies are\r\nlacking, it may be highly desirable for the church which has suitable\r\nrooms to equip one as a play room, or to establish a play ground for the\r\nchildren, or to organize a dramatic club. But where there is more than\r\none church in a community, it is obviously difficult to organize\r\nrecreational work on sectarian lines. In some instances the churches are\r\npooling their interests in the support of a common recreational program.\r\nSome of those who most keenly feel the responsibility for the leadership\r\nof the church in this field, even go so far as to claim that on account\r\nof the moral values involved in the play of its people, play and\r\nrecreation should be chiefly directed by and centered in the church.\r\nThere is no question but that the church which does not give attention\r\nto this aspect of life and does not have some recreational and social\r\nfeatures among its activities will fail to meet the needs of its people,\r\nbut whether the church can compete with the school, the community\r\nbuilding, and independent social organizations, or whether it should\r\nseek to do so, is hardly a debatable question. The play and recreational\r\nlife of most rural communities inevitably crosses church lines, and it\r\nis well for the community that it does. People may differ on religion\r\nand yet enjoy playing together. So the church may lead and promote\r\nbetter means for play and recreation, but whenever it attempts\r\ndomination or control it will prejudice its position and will be unable\r\nto accomplish its objective.\r\n\r\n_Community Buildings._--The larger appreciation of the importance of\r\nplay and recreation in rural life has brought attention to the lack of\r\nphysical equipment. Every rural community needs a playground large\r\nenough to include a good baseball diamond and a basketball court, and a\r\nbuilding where indoor sports, gymnasium work and basketball games can be\r\nheld.\r\n\r\nOn account of the lack of such facilities many cities have bought\r\nplaygrounds upon which have been erected special buildings containing\r\ngymnasiums, game and club rooms, and often a branch library, which have\r\nbecome known as \"social centers.\" The \"social center idea\" has spread to\r\nthe country, for which various forms of social centers have been\r\nadvocated. Any building which is available for such purposes to the\r\nwhole community--the school, church, or grange hall--may become a social\r\ncenter if suitable arrangements are made for its operation as such. The\r\nU. S. Bureau of Education has urged that every school shall be made a\r\nsocial center, and as far as this is possible, it is most desirable.\r\nWhat can be accomplished through the country school is well shown in the\r\nwork of Mrs. Marie Turner Harvey in the Porter School at Kirksville,\r\nMissouri.[66] But the district school will, at best, be only the social\r\ncenter of a neighborhood, and in many cases its district is too small\r\nfor successful play or social life. Furthermore, the average one-room\r\nschool is ill-adapted in architecture or equipment for social purposes.\r\nThe consolidated school or village high school may well be made a social\r\ncenter as far as it is possible for it to so function and new schools\r\nshould be, and are being, constructed with this in view. The school\r\nbuilding and the school playground are naturally the best places for\r\ncentering the play activities of the children, especially where physical\r\ntraining or play supervisors are employed by the schools. It is a\r\nquestion, however, whether those over school age will use the school for\r\nsocial purposes as freely as some other building, unless the general\r\npolicy and management of the use of the building for community purposes\r\nis in the hands of a community organization formed for that purpose.\r\n\r\nWhere there is but one church in a community, which is practically a\r\ncommunity church, the church building or church house may be utilized as\r\na social center, and the erection of community buildings by such\r\nchurches is now being advocated. In some cases such a community building\r\nattached to a church may be a means of meeting the need; but in other\r\ncommunities affiliation with the church may not be advantageous. Where\r\nthere is more than one church, the churches may join in the operation of\r\na community building, but in that case all of the churches must be\r\nincluded or it will not have the support of the whole community--it will\r\nnot be a real _community_ building.\r\n\r\nMany grange buildings are now used but once in a fortnight or so for\r\ngrange meetings, and remain idle the rest of the time. May it not be\r\npossible to devise some equitable and satisfactory arrangement whereby\r\nthey may be made available for the constant use of all the people as\r\ncommunity buildings and still reserve them to the grange for its use at\r\nsuch times as it desires? The average rural community cannot afford to\r\ntie up so much capital in buildings which are so infrequently used.\r\n\r\nIn any event, the auspices under which a community building is to be\r\noperated and the possibility of securing the united support of the whole\r\ncommunity for it are essential if it is to be permanently successful as\r\na \"community home.\"\r\n\r\nBecause of the limitations of school, church, and grange hall, many\r\ncommunities are now planning to erect \"community buildings\"[67] in which\r\nall the \"leisure-time activities\" of the whole community may be\r\ncentered. The community building will usually include an auditorium with\r\nstage for entertainments and dramatics, which is often used for a\r\ngymnasium or basketball, a kitchen and dining room, a game room,\r\npossibly a library room, and such other features as may be practicable.\r\nIn older communities there are often more buildings than are being used.\r\nUnused churches may well be converted to community buildings with\r\nrelatively small expense. The advent of prohibition and good roads has\r\ndriven many village hotels out of business and their buildings are in\r\nsome cases suitable for conversion into community buildings and may be\r\npurchased at much below cost. Some sort of organization must be the\r\nowner of a community building and assure its support, and it would seem\r\nthat if the building is to be truly a community affair it should be\r\noperated by the community as such. In some states legislation has been\r\npassed permitting the township, or any voluntary tax district, to erect\r\nand operate a community building, and many such buildings are in\r\nsuccessful operation. In other cases, it will be desirable to form some\r\nsort of community organization, which is open to all members of the\r\ncommunity and which represents all of the organizations and interests\r\nwhich may use the building, for its erection and control.\r\n\r\nThus rural play and recreation which formerly centered in the\r\nneighborhood, is now being organized on a community basis, and the\r\nincreased interest in adequate facilities for play and recreation is, in\r\nlast analysis, an effort of the rural community to defend its integrity\r\nagainst the lure of its people by the city. Just as in their economic\r\nlife and in their educational system rural people are compelled to act\r\ntogether as a community if they are to compete with the advancing\r\nstandards of the city, so play and recreation is also becoming a concern\r\nof the whole community.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[58] See his \"The Meaning of Infancy.\"\r\n\r\n[59] \"The Play of Man.\" Translated by Elizabeth L.

The villager has a definite idea of the\r\nvillage because it has a boundary, he can see it, and in many cases it\r\nis incorporated; but in most cases, outside of New England at least, the\r\nvillager and the farmer have not thought of themselves as belonging to\r\nthe same community. Farmers do, however, belong to many organizations\r\nwhich meet in the village and more and more farmer and villager mingle\r\nin the associations devoted to various special interests. The farmer's\r\nloyalty has, therefore, been primarily to organizations rather than to\r\nthe community as such, but as these different organizations have\r\nmultiplied he has become increasingly aware that most of them, each in\r\nits own field, are devoted to the interests of the common good. Through\r\nthe common interests of organizations in the life of all the people is\r\narising a new conception of the community. As Professor E. C. Lindeman\r\nhas well pointed out,[68] at the present time the community is more an\r\nassociation of groups than of individuals, and it is these groups and\r\norganizations which largely control community action. If we are to\r\nunderstand the relation of the farmer to his community, we can do so\r\nonly by knowing the organizations and groups to which he belongs, for it\r\nis in them and through them that his loyalty to the community arises.\r\n\r\n_The Grange._--By all odds the strongest local organization of farmers\r\nthroughout the northern and western states is the Grange, which is the\r\nlocal unit of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry. For half a century,\r\nfrom the time of its organization in 1868 until 1920, it had a larger\r\ninfluence upon national legislation than any other organization of\r\nfarmers, and it was largely through its efforts that many of the more\r\nimportant acts for the benefit of agriculture were passed by\r\nCongress.[69] The growth in membership and number of local granges in\r\nrecent years testifies that the grange meets a real need in farm life.\r\nIts maximum membership was in 1875 when 858,050 members were paying dues\r\nto the National Grange. From then it declined to 106,782 members in\r\n1889, but in the next thirty years it grew to approximately 700,000\r\nmembers in 1919. State Granges are now organized in thirty-three states\r\nand there are approximately 8,000 local or subordinate granges. In the\r\nearlier years of its history there were many granges in the South, but\r\nsince the decline in the '80's there have been practically no granges\r\nsouth of Virginia and Missouri.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Grange is a secret order or fraternity, with a ritual\r\nsimilar to other fraternal orders, its membership is open to any one of\r\ngood character, and the local granges frequently hold \"open\" meetings to\r\nwhich all the people of the community are invited. The strength of the\r\nGrange as a community organization is largely due to two factors: first,\r\nits broad program, and second, that it is a family organization. Both\r\nmen and women are admitted to membership and in several states junior\r\ngranges for the older children are numerous. Although the grange\r\nactively supports state and national legislation for the benefit of\r\nagriculture, it is strictly non-partisan in politics and is\r\nnon-sectarian with regard to religion. In the earlier years it undertook\r\nto operate numerous coöperative enterprises, including many coöperative\r\nstores, and it was the failure of many of these which caused its sudden\r\ndecline of membership in the late '70's. In recent years, although it\r\nhas vigorously sponsored coöperation, it has favored independent\r\ncoöperative organizations, having no organic connection with the grange,\r\nwith the exception of grange insurance companies whose advantages are\r\nusually limited to grange members.\r\n\r\nPossibly the greatest service of the Grange is its educational and\r\nsocial work. The \"lecturer's hour\" is a feature of every meeting, and in\r\nthis hour a program planned by the lecturer is given by members of the\r\ngrange, or outside speakers are invited to address it on topics of\r\ninterest. These programs include both discussion of educational topics\r\nhaving to do with all phases of agriculture, home life, and civic\r\naffairs, but also music, recitations and other entertaining features.\r\nSpecial social evenings and suppers are held at frequent intervals and\r\nthe young people often enjoy an informal dance after the regular grange\r\nmeeting. The local grange, more than any other organization, provides a\r\nforum for the discussion of the problems of agriculture and country\r\nlife, and is thus a powerful agency for the creation of public opinion\r\non any matters of community concern. The management of its business and\r\nthe participation in the lecturer's programs furnish the best\r\nopportunity for the development of leadership and for training in public\r\nspeaking, so that the local Grange has been the means of discovering and\r\ntraining much of our best rural leadership.\r\n\r\nFor many years the attention of the Grange seemed to be directed chiefly\r\ntoward the support of needed national legislation, but recently grange\r\nleaders have perceived that, like all such organizations, its permanent\r\nstrength and influence depend more largely on the degree to which the\r\nlocal grange is a vital force in the life of its members and of its\r\ncommunity. In a recent article on \"The Future of the Grange,\" S. J.\r\nLowell, Master of the National Grange, ably voices this point of view:\r\n\r\n      \"The farm people of America are better informed on all the\r\n      great questions of the day; are pursuing better agricultural\r\n      methods; are demanding better roads, better schools, better\r\n      churches; are doing more effective teamwork for\r\n      forward-looking projects; and in consequence are more\r\n      valuable men and women and citizens because of the Grange\r\n      influence of the past and its presence in their life to-day.\r\n      Remove the Grange from America and there would be taken out\r\n      of our progress of a half century one of the largest\r\n      contributing factors.\r\n\r\n      \"It will be setting up a declaration contrary to the belief\r\n      of some that exerting legislative influence, important as it\r\n      is, is not the most valuable function of the Grange; that\r\n      its coöperative activities, however they may have\r\n      flourished, will not loom largest in the grange program of\r\n      the future; that not even its efforts for state and national\r\n      reform will be recorded as its greatest service to its day\r\n      and generation. Rather we must estimate the Grange value of\r\n      the future by its quiet, steady, unfaltering efforts,\r\n      continued year after year, in thousands of local\r\n      communities--many of them far removed from the busy\r\n      activities of men--to bring the rural people together, to\r\n      teach them the fundamentals of coöperation, of efficiency,\r\n      of teamwork, of practical educational progress, and of the\r\n      value of a forward-looking rural program, into whose\r\n      accomplishments all the people of a locality may\r\n      conscientiously enter.... This view of Grange service to\r\n      rural America is apparent in the extent to which the\r\n      community-betterment program has been taken up by\r\n      subordinate granges in nearly every state. Though a secret\r\n      organization--a fraternity in fact as well as in name--the\r\n      Grange is more and more making of itself an overflowing\r\n      institution, seeking to render actual benefits to its\r\n      immediate home locality. Hundreds of live Granges this year\r\n      are carrying out some form of community improvement along a\r\n      great variety of directions.\"[70]\r\n\r\nHe then goes on to give a brief glimpse of the variety of these\r\ncommunity enterprises. In Massachusetts the State Grange has for several\r\nyears had a committee which awards annual prizes for the best community\r\nimprovement work done by the local granges, and this has stimulated a\r\nlively interest in community activities.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Grange is primarily a farmers' organization, yet where the\r\nlocal grange meets in the village, and particularly in the older states,\r\na considerable number of the members are village people, so that the\r\nGrange represents the life of the whole community. On the other hand, in\r\nmany neighborhoods which are at some distance from a village center, the\r\nGrange hall may be located in the open country, its membership is\r\ncomposed wholly of farmers, and it is solely a class organization. No\r\nstudies are available to show the proportion of Granges which meet in\r\nvillages or in the open country and the effect which this has upon the\r\nrelation of the Grange to the community, but it may be safely asserted\r\nthat, as is the case with the church and the school, the Grange tends to\r\nmeet in village centers as a matter of convenience to the largest number\r\nof its members, and that, as indicated by Mr. Lowell, it is coming to\r\nrecognize its responsibility for the general improvement of the\r\ncommunity as a whole.\r\n\r\n_Other Farmers' Organizations._--Throughout the South and in Kansas and\r\nNebraska the Farmers' Educational and Coöperative Union is the leading\r\nfarmers' organization, but it is chiefly devoted to coöperative business\r\nenterprises and does but little for the education or social life of its\r\nmembers, who are usually all men. The same may be said of the Society of\r\nEquity, which is strongest in Wisconsin, Kentucky, and South Dakota. In\r\nMichigan, although the Grange is strong, the Gleaners have a\r\nconsiderable membership.\r\n\r\nIn many states, particularly where the grange is not well established,\r\nfarmers' clubs have been organized. In some cases local conditions make\r\nclubs feasible where it would be difficult to enlist a large enough part\r\nof the community to make a grange equally successful. In some cases such\r\nclubs are open to farmers only; in others they include the whole family;\r\nwhile in recent years many farm women's clubs have been organized.\r\nWhether such clubs should be for the whole family, or for men or women\r\nonly, is largely a local question depending upon the social usages and\r\nhomogeneity of the population. In Wisconsin and Minnesota family clubs\r\nhave been most successful. It is doubtful whether this would be equally\r\ntrue in the South. In the South such local clubs have been the local\r\nunits of the extension work in agriculture and home economics. Where for\r\nany reason it is not possible to include the whole community in a club,\r\nseveral clubs may be organized, each including a congenial membership,\r\nas is now the case with women's clubs in cities, and these may then be\r\nfederated for community purposes.\r\n\r\n_Lodges._--In most rural villages will be found one or more lodges of\r\nfraternal orders, such as the Masons, Odd Fellows, Knights of Pythias,\r\nMaccabees, etc., with the corresponding orders of women's auxiliaries.\r\nThe place and influence of lodges in the life of the rural community\r\nhave been strangely neglected by students of country life, and we have\r\nno means of evaluating their place in the rural community. Not\r\ninfrequently the regular meetings and special parties and banquets held\r\nby these orders form a large part of the social life of the village. In\r\nother cases the meetings are but poorly attended and the lodge is\r\nmaintained chiefly for its insurance benefits. In some of the larger\r\nvillages and towns the larger and more prosperous lodges have game rooms\r\nand reading rooms attached to their halls, so that they serve as club\r\nrooms for their membership. Usually the membership is more largely\r\ncomposed of village people, but a considerable number of farmers\r\nmaintain their membership, even though they do not attend regularly, and\r\nin exceptional cases the membership is largely composed of farm people.\r\nIt is obvious that the lodge as a secret order is devoted to the\r\ninterests of its own membership and usually it has no definite program\r\nof work for the benefit of the whole community. Yet it must be\r\nrecognized that the assistance rendered by the lodge to its members in\r\nsickness and to their families when in distress of any kind, is a\r\nconsiderable asset to the welfare of the community and is a powerful\r\ninfluence in promoting that spirit of brotherhood upon which all\r\ncommunity life depends. Usually the lodges actively support and\r\nparticipate in any community activities in which they may appropriately\r\ntake part, such as Memorial Day or Fourth of July celebrations,\r\ncommunity Christmas trees and other festival occasions. The churches, or\r\nat least the ministers, sometimes feel that the social life of the\r\nlodges absorbs so much of the time and interest of their members as to\r\nprevent their activity in church work, which attitude has often obtained\r\nbetween the church and Grange, but it is a question whether this is not\r\noften due to the failure of the church to provide such activities as\r\nwill command the loyalty of the people, and, on the other hand, not\r\ninfrequently the leaders in lodge work are also most active in the\r\nchurches. To the extent that the lodges seem self-centered and make no\r\ndirect contribution to community improvement, this is doubtless due to\r\nthe lack of any means whereby their support may be enlisted in a program\r\nof community betterment. The place of the lodge in the community is much\r\nlike that of a fraternity in a college or university; its primary\r\nobligation is to its own membership, but when enlisted in any activity\r\nfor the common welfare it furnishes one of the best means for developing\r\nthe community spirit of its members, and its participation is a means of\r\nstrengthening its own organization.\r\n\r\n_The Village Band._--A good village band is one of the most effective\r\nagencies for promoting community spirit and sociability. The village\r\nmerchants have also found that it is an economic asset, and in many\r\ncountry towns they contribute liberally for its support. A band concert\r\nevery Saturday night, or twice a week, never fails to bring a crowd of\r\npeople to town and it is a common sight to see the streets lined with\r\nautomobiles of farm people who have come in to enjoy the concert and\r\nincidentally to do a little shopping and chat with each other and their\r\nvillage friends. Although it may be called by the name of the village,\r\nit is usually a community band, for farm boys who can play an instrument\r\nare always welcome and frequently form a considerable part of the\r\nmembership. The community comes to have a real pride in even a\r\nmoderately good band, and on holiday celebrations and other festival\r\noccasions it is an invaluable asset to community spirit. A crowd will\r\nalways follow a band, for it exercises a sort of group leadership for\r\nwhich there seems to be no substitute.\r\n\r\nIn one small town in central New York the high school operates a moving\r\npicture show every Saturday evening, which is preceded by a band concert\r\nand part of the profits of the show goes to the support of the band.\r\nThus the community finances and controls its own entertainment. Another\r\nsmall village in western New York had a fairly good band which had been\r\nplaying in neighboring villages as the only means of securing an income,\r\nand was thus drawing trade of farmers from its own village to those\r\nwhere it played. The first enterprise of the community council which was\r\nformed there was to build a band stand and to see that the band was\r\nfinanced so that it played every Saturday night in the home town. In\r\nanother case a community council was formed for the primary purpose of\r\nbringing the support of the whole community to a fine band which had\r\nstruggled along for several years with little local appreciation.\r\n\r\nCommunity orchestras are of equal value for indoor entertainments and\r\ngive opportunity for the talent of the young women as well as the men.\r\nThe community chorus or choral club has often taken the place of the\r\nold-fashioned singing school. If a good director can be secured he will\r\nalways discover more vocal ability than has been suspected, and the\r\npeople of many a rural community have been surprised at the musical\r\nworks they have been able to produce under competent leadership.\r\n\r\nThe amount of music in a community and the public interest in its\r\nmusical entertainments are among the most significant indices of its\r\ngeneral culture and progressiveness. Where there is music there is life.\r\n\r\n_The Fire Company._--One of the \"most ancient and honorable\" of the\r\norganizations of the village is the volunteer fire company. The fire\r\ncompany makes an appeal to the spirit of adventure and heroism common to\r\nall red-blooded young men and furnishes something of Professor William\r\nJames' \"moral equivalent of war.\" Its drills, exhibits and competitions\r\ndevelop the finest type of team work among its members, while its\r\nparties, festivals and entertainments for raising money are always\r\noccasions of note in the social calendar of the community. In the older\r\nparts of the country the firemen very frequently have a building with\r\nclubrooms on the second floor, which form a rendezvous for its members.\r\nNot infrequently many of the nearby farm boys belong to the fire company\r\nand pay their dues for its support so that they may enjoy its social\r\nadvantages, although they may rarely have opportunity to do much actual\r\nfire-fighting. In several cases community houses have been built with\r\none corner of the first floor constructed to house the fire equipment.\r\nIn one village I found that the fire company had taken over an old hall,\r\nwhere it had clubrooms and was holding moving picture entertainments\r\nevery Saturday evening to finance the building.\r\n\r\n_The Women's Christian Temperance Union_ is by all odds the strongest\r\nnon-sectarian organization of women in the rural communities of the\r\nUnited States. In the past it has been chiefly a reform organization and\r\nits persistent agitation was a large factor in the enactment of the\r\nEighteenth Amendment to the federal constitution making prohibition\r\nnational. Although prohibition is, as yet, by no means achieved, and\r\nthere is still need of upholding and encouraging those charged with its\r\nenforcement, yet the primary purpose of the organization seems to be\r\nlargely realized. In the past it has been chiefly a militant\r\norganization, although it has taken an active interest in problems of\r\nchild welfare, education, recreation, social hygiene, and similar topics\r\naffecting home life. Its public speaking contests, picnics, suppers, and\r\nsociables have done much for the social life of many a rural community.\r\nIf the fighting spirit of the past can be enlisted in a well-rounded\r\nprogram for social welfare in every community where there is a Union,\r\nthis organization will continue to be a powerful factor in uniting the\r\nwomen in many a rural community.\r\n\r\n_The Cemetery Association._--Finally, the influence of the Cemetery\r\nAssociation as a community organization, should not be overlooked. The\r\n\"Friendship Village Married Ladies' Cemetery Improvement Sodality,\"\r\nwhich Miss Gale has made famous in her delightful stories of village\r\nlife,[71] well illustrates the influences which have been started by\r\nmany a cemetery association. Not infrequently the one thing which\r\nevinces some civic pride in an otherwise stagnant community is its\r\nwell-kept cemetery. The condition of the cemetery is a good index of\r\ncommunity spirit. When people neglect the resting place of their dead\r\nthey are not apt to do much for the living. But once arouse a feeling of\r\nshame for such neglect and the effort to clean up and beautify the\r\ncemetery has often brought all elements of the community into a common\r\nloyalty as nothing else could do, and the satisfaction from such an\r\nachievement may sufficiently stir community pride as to encourage other\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\nThe cemetery itself has a not inconsiderable influence in bringing about\r\nthe integration of the rural community. In early days every farm had its\r\nown burying lot. Nothing is more pathetic than the abandoned burying\r\nlots--often two or three of them--on many a New England farm. In many\r\ncases rural neighborhoods have had a local cemetery by the country\r\nchurch or district school. These, too, are increasingly neglected. On\r\nthe other hand the village cemetery is more largely used merely because\r\nmore assurance is felt in its permanent maintenance. It needs no\r\nargument from history or from the customs of other lands, to show that\r\nthe people who bury their dead in the same place are bound together by\r\nthe most sacred ties, and that the cemetery which serves the whole\r\ncommunity is one of its primary bonds.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[68] \"The Community,\" p. 119.

Throughout much of the old world where farmers still\r\nlive in village communities the poverty or distress of any family is at\r\nonce apparent and the more fortunate members of the village in one way\r\nor another give such assistance as is possible. The more primitive the\r\npeople the more binding is this obligation for mutual aid, and one\r\ncannot but feel that our so-called advanced civilization has failed to\r\ndevelop as keen a sense of responsibility for the unfortunate. In rural\r\nAmerica this is possibly due to the fact that our farms are scattered\r\nand the condition of needy families may not be noticed. The average\r\nrural community will usually inform an inquirer that it has practically\r\nno poverty and no need of a social worker. Yet investigation will almost\r\nalways show that tucked away in some hollow, back on some hill, or even\r\nhuddled near the outskirts of the village are a few unfortunate\r\nfamilies, of whose needs the community is unaware. These families, for\r\none reason or another are \"disadvantaged,\" they do not commonly\r\nassociate with others, they may be foreigners, or in some way they are\r\n\"queer\" and are more or less avoided, or possibly they are merely\r\nisolated and so are unknown. From the standpoint of the social welfare\r\nof the community such families, or individuals, have been called the\r\n\"unadjusted\"; they do not mix freely and are not up to the local\r\nstandards of life. In short, such families or individuals are abnormal,\r\nand are a social liability of the community.\r\n\r\nThese \"disadvantaged\" or \"unadjusted\" people may be roughly grouped into\r\nfour classes: the dependent, the defective, the delinquent, and the\r\nneglected. In one sense they may all be called the \"community's\r\ndependent,\" for they all require some sort of assistance from the\r\ncommunity if their relationship to it is to be satisfactorily adjusted.\r\n\r\n_Poverty._--In a narrower sense the \"dependent\" are the poor; those who\r\nare unable to support themselves and who must be aided by the community\r\nif they are to exist. If this condition becomes chronic they are\r\npaupers; but in most cases their dependency is temporary and has been\r\ndue to some unusual drain on the family's resources, such as, sickness,\r\nfire, crop failure, or inability to secure employment. There is a very\r\nnatural aversion on the part of the latter class against becoming\r\nstigmatized as paupers and of having to secure public relief, of \"being\r\non the town\"; whereas the habitual dependents have frequently lost all\r\npride in their social status and are quite willing to continue to\r\nreceive all the help they can secure. In both cases, if assistance is to\r\nbe of permanent value, the problem is not only that of furnishing\r\nimmediate relief in the form of food, clothing, or shelter, but of\r\nascertaining the causes of the dependency and giving such assistance and\r\nsympathetic encouragement as will enable the family or individual to\r\nagain become self-supporting and regain a normal status in the\r\ncommunity. Obviously this is a delicate task which requires the best\r\nknowledge of human nature as well as genuine sympathy which will inspire\r\nconfidence and faith, and in so far as possible is likely to be more\r\neffective if it can be done privately. On the other hand, a large\r\nproportion of the chronic dependency also involves mental or physical\r\ndefectiveness or moral delinquency which cannot be remedied by the mere\r\ngiving of alms. Much of the poor relief given by rural communities is\r\npractically wasted because of a failure to ascertain the real cause of\r\npoverty or by lack of knowledge or means for its treatment.\r\n\r\n_Defectives._--In most cases the care of \"defectives\" cannot be\r\nundertaken by the rural community itself, because they usually require\r\nthe care of institutions which can only be supported by the county or\r\nstate. Furthermore, a family is usually able to take care of one of its\r\nmembers who is so afflicted or will assume the burden of sending him to\r\nan institution, so that only in the case of dependent families does the\r\nresponsibility rest on the community. There is, however, a duty on the\r\npart of the community to see that the afflicted are given necessary\r\ncare, so that they may not have to go through life so handicapped that\r\nthey are unable to be self-supporting and thus may become wholly\r\ndependent.\r\n\r\nThe physically defective are largely cared for by state and county\r\ninstitutions. We have learned that the deaf and blind may become largely\r\nself-supporting if given the advantages of a specific type of education,\r\nfor which the state maintains special schools. County and state\r\nhospitals provide for the care of those afflicted with tuberculosis and\r\na beginning is being made in the provision of state hospitals for\r\ncrippled children where they may receive necessary surgical and\r\northopedic treatment. Likewise the more helpless mental defectives, the\r\ninsane, the imbeciles and idiots, are cared for in state institutions.\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious menaces to the social health of the rural\r\ncommunity is from those mental defectives who are able to care for\r\nthemselves but who are mentally incapable of rearing a normal family and\r\nof conforming to the customary standards of morality. These\r\n\"feeble-minded,\" are far too numerous in rural communities and their\r\nproper care and education has been neglected because they have been\r\ncommonly regarded as merely \"simple minded\" or \"foolish\"; to be pitied,\r\nand the subject of many a jest, but entirely harmless. A large number of\r\nthe feeble-minded are so nearly normal that they are considered merely\r\nshiftless or stupid. Nearly every rural community has one or more\r\nfamilies, and not infrequently a small slum neighborhood, who are\r\nne'er-do-wells, more or less delinquent and frequently requiring aid\r\nfrom the town. Thanks to modern psychology, we now know that many of\r\nthese adults have the intelligence of only a seven or nine-year-old\r\nchild and that they are incapable of further mental development.\r\nFurthermore, carefully conducted studies in the heredity of these\r\nfamilies show that feeble-mindedness is congenital; that where both\r\nparents are feeble-minded all the offspring will be so afflicted; and\r\nthat when one of the parents is sub-normal that some of the children\r\nwill be feeble-minded and that those who appear normal may transmit the\r\ndefect to their children. Psychological tests have now been developed so\r\nthat adults with a mentality of nine or ten years or less may be\r\ndefinitely diagnosed as mentally deficient.\r\n\r\nIt must be obvious that an adult with fully developed sexual desires but\r\nwith the mind of a child is incapable of conforming his or her behavior\r\nto the standards of society and will be incapable of giving proper\r\nparental care to children. So a considerable percentage of our petty\r\ncriminals, vagrants, prostitutes, and dependent are found to be\r\nfeeble-minded. They are unstable, suggestible, easily victimized.\r\n\r\nThe farm and the village have a considerable amount of routine work\r\nwhich can be done by these sub-normal people and they therefore have\r\nopportunity to maintain themselves and to multiply to better advantage\r\nthan in the city where the competition of life is keener. Although they\r\nare best off in a rural environment, when unrestricted and unsegregated\r\nthey are a constant menace to the community and often involve it in\r\nconsiderable expense. As soon as farmers become aware of what the\r\nfeeble-minded are costing the community, how they endanger its moral and\r\nphysical health, and that when unrestricted they continue to reproduce\r\nincapables and thus perpetuate the burden, they will demand that some\r\npracticable and reasonable measures be taken for their control. The\r\ndifficulty is that at present in most states there is no method whereby\r\nthe feeble-minded can be committed to state institutions or be otherwise\r\nsegregated unless they are paupers or unless they go voluntarily, nor is\r\nthere any means of preventing their marriage and reproduction. Dairy\r\nfarmers have learned that it pays to weed out the \"boarder\" cows from\r\ntheir herds and that if they breed from a scrub sire they will have\r\nscrub stock; but if the boarder cow was also inclined to become vicious\r\nand to corrupt the habits of the rest of the herd and the farmer knew\r\nthis trait to be hereditary, he would invariably send such a cow to the\r\nbutcher. I believe that as soon as farmers appreciate the biological\r\nsignificance of feeble-mindedness they will insist upon reasonable\r\nlegislation for its control.\r\n\r\n_Delinquency._--The third class of abnormal citizens are the\r\ndelinquents, both adult and juvenile. Almost every rural community has a\r\ncertain number of adults and children who, although not definitely\r\ncriminal, are constantly committing various misdemeanors, are vicious,\r\nor incorrigible, and there are occasional rural communities and\r\nneighborhoods which are as true slums as are found in the cities.[72]\r\nDrunkenness was formerly the greatest cause of delinquency, and the\r\ntavern and saloon were responsible for the prohibition movement whose\r\nstaunchest supporters were rural people. The bootlegger and the illicit\r\nstill continue the illegal traffic in liquor, but where prohibition has\r\nbeen in force for some time liquor has ceased to be an important factor\r\nin delinquency.\r\n\r\nWe have but few definite studies of delinquency in rural communities\r\nupon which to base any generalizations. One of the best of these is a\r\nstudy of the juvenile delinquents in 21 average rural communities in New\r\nYork state, made under the auspices of the U. S. Children's Bureau in\r\n1917.[73] In these 21 communities 185 delinquent children were found, 41\r\nof whom were classed as \"incorrigible,\" 68 were involved in sex\r\noffenses, and 75 had stolen, or were guilty of fraud. The number of boys\r\nguilty of incorrigibility and theft exceeded that of the girls by six to\r\none, but among the older sex offenders 41 were girls and but 9 were\r\nboys. This study is of particular value in showing that almost every\r\nrural community, however prosperous and progressive it may be, has its\r\nproblem of delinquency, and in its analysis of the responsibility of the\r\nhome, the school, and the church, for wayward children.\r\n\r\n_The Neglected._--The fourth class which require the care of the\r\ncommunity are the neglected. Although the aged occasionally require\r\nneighborly assistance, even though they have means for their\r\nnecessities, most of the neglected are infants and children. Orphans and\r\nfoundlings for whom homes must be found, children who are over-worked or\r\nabused, or who are living with dissolute parents, all of these must be\r\ngiven proper guardianship and a chance for healthful growth and\r\neducation, or they are likely to become delinquent and thus become a\r\npermanent liability to society. It is true that in the country the home\r\nis at its best (see chapter II), but it is also unfortunately true that\r\nsome of the most shameful and almost unbelievable cases of neglect and\r\nabuse of children are frequently found in out-of-the-way places in rural\r\ncommunities. Where compulsory school attendance laws are strictly\r\nenforced such cases may come to the attention of school officials, but\r\nin many instances no one seems responsible for discovering neglected\r\nchildren and ensuring their proper care. Most of the cities and larger\r\ntowns have Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children whose\r\nagents investigate rural cases reported to them and bring them to the\r\nattention of the courts when necessary, but there is a need for some\r\nlocal agency in every rural community which will see that neglect is\r\nprevented or stopped.\r\n\r\n_Agencies for Rural Social Work._--When we examine the means for dealing\r\nwith these \"misfit\" members of the rural community, we find that in most\r\nof our states there are few agencies either public or private, and that\r\nas a rule they are poorly adapted to render the service needed.\r\n\r\nFor the care of the poor there is the township or county poor officer,\r\nand the county poor farm as a last resort. But the poor officer, however\r\nupright and well-intentioned he may be, usually conceives his job as one\r\nfor doling out sufficient groceries, clothing, and fuel to keep a family\r\nalive, and of keeping the cost to the taxpayer as low as possible. He\r\nfeels little responsibility for furnishing sufficient aid to give the\r\nfamily a fair chance to get on its feet or for advising them or bringing\r\nsuch influences into their lives as will ensure their rehabilitation. He\r\nis charged with a most difficult task for which he has had no\r\nexperience or training, which he must handle with the greatest economy\r\nand for which he receives little compensation either in salary or public\r\nesteem. Very commonly his election is due to political strength rather\r\nthan special personal fitness. The case of the poor is commonly regarded\r\nas a necessary evil to be handled with as little trouble as possible,\r\nrather than as an opportunity to give such help to the unfortunate that\r\nfurther assistance may be unnecessary and that they may become an asset\r\nto the community.\r\n\r\nCases of delinquency involving only misdemeanors or minor offenses are\r\ntried before a justice of the peace or local magistrate. Usually these\r\nofficials are men with no legal training and with little understanding\r\nof the causes of delinquency or of how delinquents should be treated in\r\norder to give them a fair chance to become normal citizens. The usual\r\nattitude is one of determining the offense and meting out just\r\npunishment for it. Furthermore, the local justice frequently avoids\r\nhandling a case which may involve him in difficulties with his\r\nneighbors, unless he is forced to do so. Not infrequently juvenile\r\noffenders are sent to reformatories where they come into contact with\r\nworse characters and are hardened rather than reformed, whereas if they\r\nhad been placed on probation under proper supervision and under\r\nsatisfactory home conditions they might have lived decent lives.\r\n\r\nIn most of our cities juvenile cases are now handled in special juvenile\r\ncourts, which have shown the futility of the old methods of legal\r\nprocedure in the treatment of juvenile offenders. In this court the\r\njudge is assisted by probation officers who are trained as social\r\nworkers and who investigate the home conditions and other influences\r\nsurrounding the child for the information of the judge, who then handles\r\nthe case in whatever manner seems best in order to get at the facts and\r\nto bring the child to a real desire to \"make good.\" The case is heard\r\nprivately, without the ordinary rules of legal procedure, and the whole\r\nattitude of the court is more like that of a father than of the ordinary\r\njudge who inflicts punishment according to the gravity of the offense.\r\nIt must be evident that one person handling numerous cases of this kind\r\nwill soon gain an experience with them which will enable him to act more\r\nintelligently and with greater justice both to the offender and to the\r\ninterests of society than can be done by a local official who may have\r\nbut one or two such cases to handle during his whole term of office. In\r\nseveral states legislation has been passed creating juvenile courts in\r\neach county, which have jurisdiction over all juvenile cases and which\r\ncan deal not only with the children but also with their parents or\r\nguardians. The general adoption of such a system seems to be the most\r\nimportant step in the intelligent treatment of juvenile delinquents in\r\nrural districts.\r\n\r\nVery often the first waywardness of a child is in truancy from school,\r\nwhich, if it cannot be handled by the teacher, is turned over to the\r\nlocal truant officer. In many cases the truant officer is appointed\r\nbecause of his availability for such work rather than his special\r\ncompetency, and the enforcement of the truancy law is handled in a most\r\nperfunctory manner, whereas an intelligent investigation of home\r\nconditions and an effort to gain the coöperation of the parents and the\r\nconfidence and interest of the child are the only means of securing any\r\nreal reform. In several cities truancy is in charge of what are known as\r\n\"visiting teachers,\" who not only look after truants but visit the homes\r\nof those children who are not doing well in their school work, in order\r\nto determine whether home conditions are responsible and how they may be\r\nimproved. Usually the country school teacher is more in touch with the\r\nhomes of her pupils, but some of the more progressive rural counties are\r\nproviding an assistant to the county superintendent of schools, who acts\r\nboth in the capacity of truant officer and visiting teacher, assisting\r\nthe local teacher in the more difficult cases which require a\r\nconsiderable amount of time to develop proper relations in the home. To\r\nbe of most service such a person should not only have experience in\r\nschool work but should have had the training of a social worker, so that\r\nshe may understand the best means of dealing with the wayward child and\r\nwith unfavorable home conditions. It seems probable that more may be\r\ndone toward the prevention of delinquency through such social workers\r\nconnected with the school system than by any other means.\r\n\r\nIn many states there seems to be no definite system for the supervision\r\nof children for whom the state is responsible. They may be boarded or\r\nadopted by families or placed in institutions by any one of several\r\nlocal officials having jurisdiction, but none of them have the means of\r\ndetermining whether the children are being properly cared for, nor does\r\nthe county or state provide any agency for this purpose. In several\r\nstates the registration and supervision of such wards of the state is\r\nplaced in the hands of a state child welfare board or a state department\r\nof charities or public welfare, but in other states the supervision of\r\ntheir welfare is wholly dependent upon private philanthropy. Experience\r\nhas shown that where a trained social worker is employed to look up the\r\nrelatives of such children and to assist in finding homes for them and\r\nin visiting the homes and institutions to which they are committed, a\r\nconsiderable saving in the cost of their maintenance to the county is\r\nfrequently effected. In order that all of the care of children may be\r\ncentralized under one county office which can employ competent persons\r\nfor its work, several states have created county boards of child welfare\r\nwhich are charged with the whole responsibility for the care of\r\ndependent and neglected children, which is then taken entirely out of\r\nthe hands of local officials. In a few states, county boards of public\r\nwelfare have been created which have supervision not only of children\r\nbut of all dependents, defectives, and neglected, and in some cases also\r\nhave charge of the public health administration. The centralization of\r\nsuch authority in a county board which can employ executives who have\r\nhad special training and experience for such work is not only good\r\nbusiness, but it is the only method by which the state can\r\nsatisfactorily fulfil its obligation to those who are dependent upon it.\r\n\r\nUsually the rural community has few if any private agencies or\r\nassociations devoted to the assistance of its dependent. The churches\r\nand the lodges assist some of their own members. Here and there are\r\nisolated groups of King's Daughters or similar societies which devote\r\nthemselves to the care of the poor and the sick, but they are\r\ncomparatively rare in the country. The Society for the Prevention of\r\nCruelty to Children often prosecutes rural cases, but it is usually a\r\ntown or city organization and has practically no rural membership. Over\r\nthe United States as a whole, the American Red Cross has probably done\r\nmore to introduce the idea of social work into rural communities than\r\nany one agency. During the war the local chapters of the Red Cross were\r\nauthorized to give assistance to soldiers' families in any way possible.\r\nThis involved rural as well as town families, and the need of organized\r\nsocial work became apparent in thousands of rural communities. When\r\npeace was declared, the local chapters were authorized to extend the\r\nCivilian Relief work to civilian families in territory where there was\r\nno other organization doing welfare work, which meant practically all of\r\nthe rural United States, providing the work was carried on by trained\r\nworkers on a basis approved by the division headquarters. The family\r\nwelfare work of the Red Cross was happily named \"Home Service\" and has\r\nbeen organized in many rural counties where its value has been\r\nrepeatedly demonstrated. The work is directly in charge of a social\r\nworker employed by the county chapter but the local branch in each\r\ncommunity is encouraged to form a Home Service Committee which looks\r\nafter the local work as far as it is able, calls in the county worker\r\nwhen needed, and gives her all the assistance possible. Thus the work is\r\nlocalized and each community has a definite group of workers who feel\r\nresponsible for looking after those needing the community's assistance\r\nand who are learning how to do this in an intelligent manner. No other\r\nagency organized on a national basis has attempted any systematic\r\norganization of social welfare work in local rural communities.\r\n\r\n_Social Education of Rural Opinion._--The primary need for the care of\r\nthe dependent of the rural community is for a better understanding of\r\ntheir needs by its more intelligent and public-spirited people. It is a\r\nmatter of social education. Social work so-called has had a rapid\r\ndevelopment in our cities to meet the situation caused by their sudden\r\ngrowth with large numbers of foreigners having different standards of\r\nliving and unable to adjust themselves to strange conditions with\r\ncongested districts where housing and sanitation is poor and with\r\npoverty due to unemployment, sickness, and with the many factors which\r\nresult from the complexities of city life. The city slum first\r\nchallenged the humanity of the better people and numerous philanthropic\r\norganizations grew up in an effort to give assistance to needy families\r\nand children. For the most part this work has been financed by the\r\nwealthy, has been carried on by social workers who have had special\r\ntraining for such service, and is commonly known as charity. What social\r\nwork has been done in rural communities has been introduced by city\r\norganizations and has usually been fostered by organizations of as few\r\nof the more progressive people at the county seats and the larger towns\r\nor small cities which have worked out into the rural communities from\r\nthese centers. Though the purposes and work of these organizations are\r\nexcellent, they will never be able to effectively meet the needs of\r\nrural communities until their people appreciate the need for such work\r\nand actively support it.\r\n\r\nMuch of this sort of work is regarded by rural people as \"uplift\" and\r\nwithout local interest and support has little permanent value. The\r\naverage rural community has little use for charity in the ordinary sense\r\nof the word. If relief is needed within its borders, it will provide,\r\nbut it fails to appreciate that more than relief is needed to prevent\r\nthe recurrence of dependency, and that punishment will not correct or\r\nprevent delinquency. The fact is that at present country people have not\r\nseen the social situation in their own communities and so are not\r\nconcerned with it. Most of them are of the opinion that the less\r\ngovernment the better, and have not come to realize that an increasingly\r\ncomplex society--even in the rural community--makes it no longer\r\npossible for the farm family to live to itself, but that for\r\nself-preservation it must look to the social welfare of the whole\r\ncommunity with which its life is bound up.\r\n\r\nThe need, therefore, is for the education of rural people with regard to\r\ntheir social responsibilities, which must be largely accomplished\r\nthrough existing local rural organizations and local leadership. Any\r\nsystem of rural social work which is to be permanently successful must\r\nbe one which is established by the people themselves from a realization\r\nof their needs, and progressively developed as they appreciate its\r\nworth. As Dean A. R. Mann recently said, \"In dealing with rural affairs\r\nit has long been a common mistake to underrate the validity of the\r\nfarmer's own judgment as to what is good for him.\" \"Superimposed\r\norganizations are usually doomed to failure because they express the\r\njudgments of those without the community rather than those within whom\r\nthey are intended to serve.\" \"Ordinarily the most serviceable rural\r\norganizations will be built out of the materials of the community.\"[74]\r\nIt is for this reason that the advance of rural social work will depend\r\nupon arousing an active interest in the welfare of the community's\r\n\"disadvantaged\" through discussion by such organizations as the church,\r\nthe grange, the farm and home bureau, lodges, women's clubs, instruction\r\nin high schools, etc. The work of the public health nurse will reveal\r\nmany family problems with which she is unable to deal and which demand\r\nthe help of one experienced in social work, and the nurse will be of\r\nservice in educating the community to the need of such work.\r\n\r\nIt seems obvious that by itself the rural community is too small a unit\r\nto employ a social worker who is professionally trained for dealing with\r\nthe more difficult social mal-adjustments, and that it must coöperate\r\nwith other communities for the organization of such work on a county\r\nbasis. Experience has shown that trained social workers actually save\r\nthe county the cost of their salaries and expenses, without considering\r\nthe greater efficiency and permanent value of the work done. The social\r\nworker has been well termed a \"doctor of domestic difficulties.\" Every\r\ncounty and community needs such a doctor who is skilled in treating\r\nsocial disease, but one of her chief functions will be to act as an\r\neducational director in promoting the study of local social conditions\r\nby the existing organizations in every community and in discovering and\r\ntraining leadership for carrying out a constructive program as it is\r\nevolved. In some way there should be a volunteer committee or worker in\r\neach community associated with the county social worker to advise\r\nconcerning policies and to carry on much of the local work under her\r\nsupervision and training. For it must be recognized that the economic\r\nresources of rural communities are limited and that they cannot afford\r\nseveral social workers for different lines of effort, as is common in\r\ncities. But more important is the fact that social welfare depends more\r\nlargely upon a proper understanding of its problems by the local\r\ncommunity and a willingness to grapple with them intelligently and\r\nsympathetically, than upon the remedial treatment afforded through\r\nprofessional workers, courts, institutions and other public agencies.\r\nSocial welfare is like health, for which sanitation and hygiene are more\r\nimportant than doctors and medicines.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed in the rural community is a transformation of the\r\nold-time family hospitality and neighborliness into a feeling of\r\nresponsibility for the unfortunate within the community with whom there\r\nmay not be immediate contact, but who nevertheless affect the moral and\r\nsocial life of all its people. It needs the spirit and devotion of the\r\nGood Samaritan on the part of the people, but it also needs the public\r\nhealth nurse and the social worker who, like the inn-keeper of the\r\nparable, can give adequate care to the unfortunate.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[72] See Charles E.

In New England the townships were\r\noriginally created as community units, for they were modelled after the\r\nEuropean village community. The meeting house determined the site of the\r\nvillage where the farmers and craftsmen resided, and the boundaries of\r\nthe township were coincident with the limits of their lands. The origin\r\nof the New England township has been well described by John Fiske in a\r\nfamous chapter on this subject:[75]\r\n\r\n      \"When people from England first came to dwell in the\r\n      Wilderness of Massachusetts Bay, they settled in groups upon\r\n      small irregular-shaped patches of land, which soon came to\r\n      be known as townships. There were several reasons why they\r\n      settled thus in small groups, instead of scattering about\r\n      over the country and carving out broad estates for\r\n      themselves. In the first place, their principal reason for\r\n      coming to New England was their dissatisfaction with the way\r\n      in which church affairs were managed in the old country.\r\n      They wished to bring about a reform in the church, in such\r\n      wise that members of a congregation should have more voice\r\n      than formerly in the church-government, and that the\r\n      minister of each congregation should be more independent\r\n      than formerly of the bishop and of the civil government....\r\n      Such a group of people, arriving on the coast of\r\n      Massachusetts, would naturally select some convenient\r\n      locality, where they might build their houses near together\r\n      and all go to the same church. This migration, therefore,\r\n      was a movement, not of individuals or of separate families,\r\n      but of church congregations, and it continued to be so as\r\n      the settlers made their way inland and westward....\r\n\r\n      \"In the second place, the soil of New England was not\r\n      favorable to the cultivation of great quantities of staple\r\n      articles, such as rice or tobacco, so that there was nothing\r\n      to tempt people to undertake extensive plantations. Most of\r\n      the people lived on small farms, each family raising but\r\n      little more than enough food for its own support; and the\r\n      small size of the farms made it possible to have a good many\r\n      in a compact neighborhood. It appeared also that towns could\r\n      be more easily defended against the Indians than scattered\r\n      plantations;...\r\n\r\n      \"Thus the early settlers of New England came to live in\r\n      townships. A township would consist of about as many farms\r\n      as could be disposed within convenient distance from the\r\n      meeting-house, where all the inhabitants, young and old,\r\n      gathered every Sunday, coming on horseback or afoot....\r\n      Around the meeting-house and common the dwellings gradually\r\n      clustered into a village, and after a while the tavern,\r\n      store and town-house made their appearance.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Mormons settled Utah they established a very similar form of\r\ncommunity government centering around the church. Elsewhere, with rare\r\nexceptions, throughout the North and West the township is the primary\r\nunit of local government, save for school administration, but it is by\r\nno means identical with a community. When the lands west of the\r\nAlleghanies were surveyed for settlement they were laid off in blocks\r\nsix miles square, which were known as congressional townships, for\r\nCongress gave each township a square mile of land the proceeds of which\r\nshould form a permanent school fund. In discussing the development of\r\nthe township in Illinois, Dr. Albert Shaw writes:\r\n\r\n      \"To give effect to this liberal provision, the state enacted\r\n      a law making the township a body corporate and politic for\r\n      school purposes and authorizing the inhabitants to elect\r\n      school officers and maintain free schools. Here, then, was a\r\n      rudiment of local government. As New England township life\r\n      grew up around the church, so western localism finds its\r\n      nucleus in the school system. What more natural than that\r\n      the county election district should be made to coincide with\r\n      the school township, with a school-house for the voting\r\n      place? or that justices of the peace, constables and road\r\n      supervisors and overseers of the poor, should have their\r\n      jurisdiction determined by the same township lines?\"[76]\r\n\r\nThus in many of the North-central States the township came to be the\r\nlocal unit of government for certain minor purposes, though in other\r\nstates it is little more than an election district, and in none of them\r\nis there preserved the old town meeting which gave the New England\r\ntownship its fundamental democracy.\r\n\r\nOwing to the large plantations and the economic and social conditions\r\nprevailing throughout the South, it has had practically no units of\r\ngovernment smaller than the county, other than incorporated villages.\r\n\r\nUntil very recently our conception of society has been mostly in terms\r\nof political units, largely on account of the lack of any local unit\r\nwhich had social significance to rural people. In recent years, however,\r\nstudents of rural government have become aware of the artificiality and\r\nthe anti-social character of the township unit. There may be two rival\r\nvillages within a township, each competing for trade and the support of\r\nits associations, and striving for the political domination of the\r\ntownship, while some of the farmers in a far corner of the township may\r\ntrade in a village in the next township. Or a village may be on a\r\ntownship line, which must be observed in all matters of government\r\nalthough there is no real division of interests between its people.\r\n\r\nOutside of New England villages were located at points of geographical\r\nadvantage, or along through roads or railroads, primarily as business\r\ncenters. There was no particular relation between the village and the\r\nfarming area surrounding it. But as the village grew it often desired\r\nmodern improvements such as water systems, pavements, street lights,\r\netc., for which the farmers were unwilling to be taxed and which were\r\nthus prevented as long as the village was controlled by the township.\r\nThis has led to most of the larger villages becoming incorporated, so\r\nthat they may administer their own local government and tax themselves\r\nfor such improvements as they desire. This separation of the village\r\nfrom the township has been inevitable where the farmers take no pride or\r\ninterest in it, and has often been necessitated by their parsimony or\r\nconservatism. This is well illustrated by an incident related by\r\nProfessor Herbert B. Adams:\r\n\r\n      \"In my native town, Amherst, Mass., the villagers struggled\r\n      for years in town-meeting to secure some system of sewerage\r\n      for 'the center,' but the 'ends of the town' always voted\r\n      'no'. On one occasion, in order to allay suspicion of\r\n      extravagance, a leading villager moved that, whatever system\r\n      of sewerage be adopted, the surface water and rainfall be\r\n      allowed to take their natural course down-hill in the\r\n      ordinary gutters. The farmers sniffed danger in this wily\r\n      proposition and voted an overwhelming 'No.' Accordingly by\r\n      the local law of Amherst, water had to run uphill until the\r\n      next town-meeting! Such is the power of Democracy.\"[77]\r\n\r\nThis separate incorporation of the village has been a large factor in\r\nmaking a distinction between villagers and farmers and preventing their\r\nrecognition of their community interests. Not infrequently, however, it\r\nwill be found that some of the more progressive villages are not\r\nincorporated and that they have the loyalty of the farmers. Numerous\r\nexamples of unincorporated villages might be cited to show that where a\r\nspirit of pride in local village institutions has been developed among\r\nthe farmers of the territory tributary to it, that village improvements\r\nnot only are not impeded, but the community is much strengthened. This\r\nis more likely to be true, however, where the township boundary and the\r\nnatural community area are practically the same.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the progress of a rural community, i.e., a village\r\nand the territory tributary to it, often is prevented if it cannot\r\ncommand a majority of the votes in a township. In a nearby village is a\r\ntown hall which might be used as a community house and be a social\r\ncenter for the whole community. But the borders of the township belong\r\nto other communities and do not come to the township center, and these\r\npeople on the edge of the township very naturally take the position that\r\nif the village and neighboring people wish to use the town hall, let\r\nthem rent it of the town, but why should the whole township be taxed for\r\nadvantages which only half of it can enjoy. The same line of argument\r\narises with regard to the location of schools, roads, libraries, and the\r\ndistricts for public health nurses. Unless the whole township can be\r\nequally well served, a community which forms but part of the township is\r\nunable to secure these advantages unless it can command a majority of\r\nthe votes, or except as the village incorporates, and then it loses the\r\nsupport of the taxes from the farms of the community which share the\r\nbenefits.\r\n\r\nAs long as farm life was on the neighborhood basis, its interests\r\nlargely centering in the district school and the country church, its\r\nroads maintained by the labor of its citizens under a local road\r\nsupervisor, and trips to the village were made only once or twice a week\r\nfor mail and supplies, farmers did not feel the need for a unit of local\r\ngovernment other than the township. But when the church, the grange and\r\nthe lodge are in the village, when they desire consolidated schools,\r\nlibraries, and community houses, which are most convenient to all at the\r\nvillage center, and when they desire the improvement of local roads so\r\nthat they will best connect with state and county roads, then the\r\ninterests of the farmers and the villagers unite them in these common\r\nenterprises, and the community comes into conflict with the rest of the\r\ntownship if the township is composed of more than one community.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it must be recognized that for many purposes the\r\ncommunity, or even the township, is too small a unit to secure the\r\ngreatest efficiency in administration of public agencies, and so there\r\nhas been a distinct tendency toward the centralization of many functions\r\nof local government in county officials. Thus the county superintendent\r\nof schools is assuming more and more control over the local school\r\nsystem, the county supervision of roads is increasing, and we have shown\r\n(p. 145) the desirability of a county health administration, the need\r\nfor county juvenile courts (p. 188), county boards for the\r\nadministration of welfare work (p. 191), and a county library system.\r\nThe county tends to become a rural municipality very similar in function\r\nand organization to the city, and the logical outcome seems to be the\r\nemployment of a county manager under a commission or county council,\r\nwhich has already become possible in Maryland and California.[78] That\r\nthis centralization makes possible a greater efficiency in\r\nadministration can hardly be doubted, but that it tends to destroy the\r\ninitiative and responsibility of the local community is equally\r\napparent. With an over-centralization of administration, whether in the\r\ncounty or the state, the local community loses the very ties which have\r\nbound it together. The adjustment of the desires for efficiency and for\r\nlocal democracy is one of the unsolved problems of government.\r\nExperience shows clearly that the local community or township is too\r\nsmall a unit to secure efficient administration; but it is also evident\r\nthat without some degree of local responsibility and control,\r\ncentralized administration tends to become bureaucratic and the people\r\nare deprived of that participation in government which is essential for\r\nthe life of a democracy.\r\n\r\nThus the need for the local self-government of rural communities has\r\nbecome apparent to rural leaders. It is interesting to note that this is\r\nbecoming appreciated in the South, where on account of social and\r\neconomic conditions local government has been almost entirely lacking in\r\nthe past, but where new conditions give rise to new desires which cannot\r\nbe realized except through some means whereby a locality can be free to\r\nwork out its own salvation. This point of view has been vigorously\r\nexpressed by Dr. Clarence Poe, editor of the Progressive Farmer and a\r\nrecognized leader of rural life in the South:\r\n\r\n      \"The chief task of the man who would help develop a rich and\r\n      puissant rural civilization here in the South--the chief\r\n      task perhaps of the man who would make an agricultural\r\n      State like North Carolina the great commonwealth it ought to\r\n      be--is to develop the rural community.\"...\r\n\r\n      \"Consider the fact that the country community is the only\r\n      social unit known to our civilization that is without\r\n      definite boundaries and without machinery for\r\n      self-expression and development--without form, and void, as\r\n      was chaos before creation.\"...\r\n\r\n      \"But for the country community there is no organic means of\r\n      expression whatever. There is, of course, that shadowy and\r\n      futile geographical division known as the Township--but it\r\n      is laid off utterly without regard to human consideration,\r\n      and serves no purpose save as a means of defining voting\r\n      boundaries and limiting the spheres of constables and\r\n      sheriff's deputies--a mere ghostly phantom of a social\r\n      entity that we need not consider at all.\"[79]\r\n\r\nAnd he then goes on to show the advantages of the New England township.\r\n\r\n_Community School Districts._--The most significant beginning toward the\r\ncreation of self-government for the rural community is in the laws which\r\nhave been passed by several states permitting redistricting for the\r\nestablishment of community high schools or consolidated schools,\r\nirrespective of township or county boundaries and according to the\r\ndesire of the prospective patrons of the schools. Thus in 1919 Nebraska\r\npassed a state rural school redistricting law under which every county\r\nhas a redistricting committee which determines what seem to be the\r\nnatural boundaries of the district, which are then subject to petitions\r\nfrom the people for their alteration, and the whole plan is then\r\nsubmitted to a vote of the county. \"The law does not explicitly state\r\nthat the proposed districts must correspond to a natural community in\r\nthe social sense; it only says that they must be very much larger than\r\nthe old ones, approximately twenty-five square miles. The inevitable\r\nresult, however, of opening the question and of freeing community choice\r\nfrom old political boundaries is to settle on new areas approaching\r\nsocial units with self-conscious community ties.\"[80] Kansas and\r\nIllinois have somewhat similar legislation and a community unit is\r\nproposed by the Committee of 21 which has recently conducted a survey of\r\nthe rural school situation in the State of New York.\r\n\r\n_Community House Districts_.--Wisconsin has passed an act whereby the\r\npeople of any local area may vote to erect and maintain a community\r\nhouse and may establish the boundaries of the area in which the citizens\r\nshall have the right to tax themselves for this purpose, and to elect\r\ntrustees of the house, in much the same manner as community school\r\ndistricts are established. It seems probable that when a natural social\r\narea has thus been determined it will probably be the same for both\r\nschool and community house, and that it might be the best unit for the\r\nsupport of such community agencies as a public library, or a\r\npublic-health nurse, and thus a real community government might\r\ngradually arise and might ultimately displace the arbitrary township\r\ngovernment, although the township might be retained for its original\r\npurpose of land registration.\r\n\r\n_Rural Community Incorporation_.--The most advanced step in giving the\r\nrural community self-government is An Act to Provide for the\r\nIncorporation of Rural Communities, passed by the legislature of North\r\nCarolina in 1919.[81] This act gives authority for the incorporation of\r\nrural communities including definite school districts, which may or may\r\nnot include hamlets or village centers, but which must be at least two\r\nmiles from any town or city of five thousand or more inhabitants. It\r\ngives such incorporated rural communities the general powers and\r\nprivileges of an incorporated village, except that they cannot lose\r\ntheir identity as a part of the school and road systems of the county.\r\nTaxes may be levied for various public purposes, but they must be voted\r\nat an annual meeting at which a majority of the registered voters must\r\nbe present, or be submitted to an election, and the amount of taxes and\r\nbonds are limited. Although about a dozen communities have incorporated\r\nunder this act, but few of them seem to be actively functioning, due to\r\nvarious local causes. The act itself, however, is well conceived and is\r\nworthy of study by those interested in better rural government.\r\n\r\nAnother method of accomplishing the same end is by a special act of\r\nincorporation for a particular community, as was passed by the\r\nLegislature of New Jersey for Plainsboro Township in 1919.\r\n\r\nConcerning the organization of this community, Hon. Alva Agee, State\r\nSecretary of Agriculture, writes:\r\n\r\n      \"Every voter within its boundaries signed a petition to the\r\n      legislature for the creation of a new township embracing the\r\n      territory belonging to the community, and this was granted.\r\n      The community then met, made a declaration of its purposes\r\n      and adopted a constitution providing for control of all\r\n      township and community affairs. It is a return to direct\r\n      government by the people, and places responsibility upon\r\n      every individual. It is the old New England town-meeting\r\n      made effective. Patient study of every detail was given by\r\n      members of the community.\"[82]\r\n\r\nThe declaration of purposes and constitution[83] are so unique that they\r\nshould be studied by all interested in community government.\r\n\r\n      \"A DECLARATION OF PURPOSES\r\n\r\n      \"We, the residents of Plainsboro Township, New Jersey,\r\n      declare our purpose to accept all the duties of American\r\n      citizenship.\r\n\r\n      We are forming an association to secure all the benefits of\r\n      community life, and affirm the right of our community to\r\n      each one's best effort.\r\n\r\n      We support all individual rights just as far as their use\r\n      does not harm our fellows.\r\n\r\n      We agree that the public good is superior to any private\r\n      gain obtained at the expense of community welfare.\r\n\r\n      We recognize and acknowledge the gracious influences of\r\n      practical Christianity in community life.\r\n\r\n      We ask that our homes be guarded by right social conditions\r\n      throughout our community.\r\n\r\n      We declare the duty of the community to provide good\r\n      schools, means for community recreation, safe sanitary\r\n      conditions, improved highways, and encouragement to thrift\r\n      and home-ownership.\r\n\r\n      We purpose to make the neatness and attractiveness of our\r\n      homes and farms assets of distinct value to the township.\r\n\r\n      We agree to do our share in the creation of public sentiment\r\n      in support of all measures in the public interest.\r\n\r\n      We agree to put aside all partisan and sectarian relations\r\n      when dealing with community matters.\r\n\r\n      We state our conviction that the best rewards from this\r\n      organized effort lie before each one in a deepened interest\r\n      in others and in an increased ability to coöperate the one\r\n      with the other for the good of all.\r\n\r\n      We, the citizens of Plainsboro Township, incorporated by act\r\n      of the Legislature of the State of New Jersey, approved\r\n      April 1, 1919, and accepted by us on May 6, 1919, subscribe\r\n      to this declaration.\"\r\n\r\nIf such a Declaration of Purposes were adopted by every rural community,\r\nand were taught the children as a civic oath of allegiance, would it not\r\nhave more immediate effect on practical patriotism than even the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and what new meaning would be given to\r\nlocal government? Here is an example of rural civic spirit which, if it\r\ncould become general throughout the rural communities of the United\r\nStates, would remold the political and social organization of the whole\r\ncountry; for it provides both the mechanism and the spirit which are\r\nessential for making democracy a reality rather than an ideal.\r\n\r\n_Community Government and Democracy._--The local community is\r\nindispensable as the primary political unit for the maintenance of true\r\ndemocracy, both because it is small enough that there can be personal\r\nrelations between its members, in which a real consensus of opinion can\r\nbe formed, and also because only in it can the masses of mankind have\r\nany personal experience or participation in government. Unless the\r\nindividual has a social consciousness of the community in which he\r\nlives, he can have but a feeble and hazy realization of larger social\r\ngroups. Unless the community through its individuals is self-conscious,\r\nit cannot take its rightful place in the larger community of which it\r\nforms a part. If democracy does not obtain in the local community, the\r\nvoice of such a community in the affairs of the county or state will be\r\nthat of its self-chosen leaders. It is difficult to conceive how any\r\nreal democracy can be secured in State or Nation where it does not\r\nobtain in their constituent communities. It is entirely possible to have\r\na government democratic in form and theory, but actually a political or\r\neconomic feudalism, supported by local chieftains who represent not the\r\npeople, but themselves or some business or other special interests. The\r\nvery life of true democracy is in the participation of individuals in\r\nthe government of the local group and in the organization of the\r\nlocality groups, so that there may be a fair discussion and expression\r\nby those who are bound together by common interests through some form of\r\nself-government for the rural community.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[75] \"Civil Government in the United States,\" pp. 17, 18.

In the previous\r\nchapters we have noted the various aspects and problems of rural life\r\nwhich have necessitated the community as a unit for social organization.\r\nAs a result of the growing conviction that the conditions of rural life\r\ncan be made satisfying only through the collective efforts of definite\r\ncommunities, there has arisen a widespread movement for the better\r\norganization of community interests and activities, which has come to be\r\nknown as community organization. Although this movement is being\r\nencouraged by many agencies, its greatest significance and importance\r\narises from the fact that, for the most part, community organization of\r\nmany diverse types is springing up in rural communities throughout the\r\ncountry as a means of meeting their local needs. This spontaneity of the\r\nmovement is the best evidence that changing conditions have brought\r\nabout a real need for some better machinery for community development.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand community organization so that we may\r\nintelligently encourage its development, it will be well to consider (1)\r\nthe underlying causes, (2) the process of organization, and (3) the\r\nforms of organization.\r\n\r\n1. _Causes._--Usually the immediate cause of attempting community\r\norganization is the common desire to meet a need which cannot well be\r\nrealized except through the united effort of the whole community.\r\nImproved roads are needed, a library or playground is desired, a Liberty\r\nLoan must be raised, a Fourth of July celebration or a pageant is to be\r\nundertaken, a band or baseball team needs financial support and\r\npatronage to prevent its disbanding, hard times or a fire make unusual\r\naid necessary to certain families, an influenza epidemic compels a\r\nunited effort for the care of the sick. In all such cases a citizens'\r\ncommittee is usually organized which represents various organizations\r\nand interests so that the support of all the elements in the community\r\nmay be enlisted. When any common need is of such a magnitude or of such\r\na nature that it is not within the field of any one organization or\r\nagency, then some form of at least temporary community organization is\r\nnecessary. When some of these needs, such as a community house or a\r\npublic health nurse, require permanent maintenance, and the coöperation\r\nof various organizations is essential for the success of the enterprise,\r\nthen some permanent form of community organization becomes desirable. If\r\na community organization is to be permanent and is to really function,\r\nthere must be work for it to do which cannot or will not be done by\r\nexisting agencies.\r\n\r\nA second cause for community organization arises from the increasing\r\ncomplexity of human relationships, even in a rural community. We have\r\nobserved that in recent years there has been a rapid increase in the\r\nnumber of associations each of which is devoted to some one special\r\ninterest. The life of simpler or more primitive communities is a unit\r\nwith regard to all phases of their life, religion, government, and\r\nsocial affairs. Such was the township of colonial New England and many\r\na community in the pioneer stage. But in modern times a multiplicity of\r\nvoluntary associations have sprung up and have spread from one community\r\nto another. In many cases the members of such organizations become more\r\nloyal to them than to the community; organizations become self-centered\r\nand divisive rather than being devoted to the community good. Religion,\r\ngovernment, economic life, and education have become more or less\r\nseparate spheres of life, each having a code of its own, whereas human\r\nproblems involve all of these aspects of life and cannot be successfully\r\nsolved while there is conflict of standards between religion, business,\r\ngovernment, and social life. Not infrequently more than one organization\r\nundertakes the same or similar work, or the demands of one clash with\r\nthose of another, and social confusion arises. When this occurs in a\r\nlarge city between organizations which are supported by the wealthy or\r\nby different groups, each may go as far as its resources will permit;\r\nbut in the rural community where organizations must be of the people and\r\nsupported by all of them, such a situation cannot be tolerated for both\r\nfunds and leadership are limited.\r\n\r\nOrganizations arise to meet recognized human needs, but no one\r\norganization can meet all the needs of the whole community. Nor do all\r\norganizations appeal to all people. Men associate according to their\r\nspecial individual interests, some are more interested in religion and\r\nbusiness, others in social life or athletics, or what not. As the\r\norganizations representing these interests become more and more\r\nspecialized, each individual belongs to several organizations, whose\r\ninterests sometimes conflict and members of a community are arrayed\r\nagainst each other. Thus an individual is sometimes involved in a\r\ndivided loyalty between two groups, and finds himself with a conflict of\r\npurposes which lessens that personal unity which is essential for\r\ncharacter and personal peace. The character of the individual is\r\ndeveloped to the extent that he is able to resolve this conflict of his\r\ninterests in one dominant purpose. So the welfare of the community can\r\nbe secured only by a unity of purpose among its organizations in their\r\nloyalty to the common good. This tendency to form associations for\r\nspecial interests is shown in the following diagram:\r\n\r\n  FOR A SATISFYING}                   {ASSOCIATIONS AND\r\n  LIFE EVERY MAN  }     These needs   {ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING\r\n  NEEDS:          }     are met by    {SPECIAL\r\n                  }                   {INTERESTS OF THE\r\n                  }                   {COMMUNITY, such as\r\n\r\n  1.

A PROGRESSIVE COMMUNITY           Some form of a Community\r\n  --A Desire for Opportunity           organization, bringing together\r\n  for All--i.e., Democracy             all the above.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand we must recognize man's gregarious tendency, his\r\ndesire for the support of public opinion, his craving of a feeling of\r\n\"togetherness.\" The elation which comes to a people engaged in war or in\r\nmeeting any common disaster comes chiefly from the satisfaction they\r\nexperience in being united in a common cause and enjoying the sanction\r\nof their fellows without division among them. The individualistic\r\nphilosophy of the more sophisticated may enable them to find\r\nsatisfaction in more or less socially segregated groups under ordinary\r\nconditions, but when they face calamity, when the most fundamental and\r\ndeepest issues of life are involved, then they enjoy association with\r\nthose who surround them--they become \"neighbors.\"\r\n\r\nThis desire of men to associate in groups which represent their special\r\ninterests, and their equal desire to be _en rapport_ with all their\r\nfellows with whom their life is associated in community life, is one of\r\nthe paradoxes into which many of our basic human problems resolve, and\r\nfurnishes one of the primary reasons for some form of community\r\norganization which will unify the increasing complexity of associations.\r\n\r\nA third underlying motive for community organization, which is just\r\ncoming to receive recognition, is the need of defending the interests of\r\nthe local community against the domination of national or state\r\norganizations, of maintaining a necessary degree of local autonomy. All\r\norganizations which become associated in state or national federations\r\ninevitably develop a central administration which tends to become more\r\nor less of a hierarchy or bureaucracy. The national organization seeks\r\nto achieve its special objects and to emphasize their supreme\r\nimportance. It tries to secure efficiency of the local groups through\r\nstandardization, and very naturally encourages their loyalty to the\r\nstate or national aims and purposes. This tendency is more or less\r\ninevitable and is an inherent weakness of all large organizations which\r\ndo not constantly place their emphasis on strengthening their local\r\nunits and encouraging devotion to community service. But in many cases\r\nthe larger organization has lost a true perspective of its relationship\r\nto its local units and of their primary duty to their local communities.\r\nThe most flagrant instance of this principle is in the domination of\r\nlocal government by national political parties, whose policies have\r\nnothing whatever to do with local administration, but who maintain their\r\n\"machines\" so that an efficient organization is available for mobilizing\r\nthe vote in state and national elections. The resulting reaction has\r\ngiven rise to citizen's tickets, commission government and city\r\nmanagers, and in the more progressive smaller communities a growing\r\ntendency to vote for the best man irrespective of party. Wherever a\r\ncommunity votes independently of national party lines on local affairs,\r\nthere will be found healthy local government. For the same general\r\nreasons we have observed the growth of the community church movement (p.\r\n127) as a protest against sectarian rivalries, the new emphasis of the\r\nmaster of the national grange (p. 172) on the community responsibilities\r\nof the grange as more important than its legislative activities, and the\r\neffort to prevent an over-centralization of school administration\r\nthrough the creation of community school districts under local control.\r\nA striking example of the reaction of local communities in self-defense\r\nagainst the demands for support from many organizations was the rapid\r\nspread of the \"War Chest\" movement among our cities during the war as a\r\nmeans of raising funds for various national organizations carrying on\r\nwar work. Subsequently the same idea has given rise to the organization\r\nof \"Community Chests\" or \"Community Funds\" for financing various\r\ncommunity and national welfare agencies, so as to ensure adequate\r\nsupport for those which are necessary, but to discourage a multiplicity\r\nof competing organizations, and to furnish a mechanism whereby the\r\ncommunity may exercise some definite policy with regard to its social\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the fundamental causes which have given rise to various\r\nexperiments in community organization. They commenced about a decade\r\nago, but increased slowly prior to the war. The war brought about a new\r\nrealization of the community, as it was necessary to organize war\r\nactivities, \"war drives,\" etc., on a community basis. Under the National\r\nCouncil of Defense were organized State and County Councils of Defense\r\nand finally President Wilson issued a letter encouraging the\r\norganization of local Community Councils,[85] to bring together all\r\norganizations and interests of the community not only for war purposes\r\nbut with a view to their future usefulness in times of peace. In this\r\nletter, President Wilson said:\r\n\r\n      \"Your State, in extending the national defense organization\r\n      by the creation of community councils, is in my opinion\r\n      making an advance of vital significance. It will, I believe,\r\n      result when thoroughly carried out in welding the Nation\r\n      together as no nation of great size has been welded before.\r\n      It will build up from the bottom an understanding and\r\n      sympathy and unity of purpose and effort which will no doubt\r\n      have an immediate and decisive effect upon our great\r\n      undertaking. You will find it, I think, not so much a new\r\n      task as a unification of existing efforts, a fusion of\r\n      energies now too much scattered and at times somewhat\r\n      confused into one harmonious and effective power. It is only\r\n      by extending your organization to small communities that\r\n      every citizen of the State can be reached and touched with\r\n      the inspiration of the common cause.\"\r\n\r\nThe organization of community councils was actively pushed by the\r\nNational and State Councils of Defense, and thousands of them were\r\norganized. This was in the summer of 1918, but owing to the early\r\ndeclaration of the Armistice they had but little opportunity to become\r\nthoroughly established. As they had been created primarily for war\r\npurposes, most of them ceased to function with the cessation of\r\nhostilities, but the idea had taken root and the experience of common\r\neffort in war activities had brought about a new sense of the value of\r\nsome sort of community organization.\r\n\r\n2. _The Process of Community Organization._--As corollaries of the\r\nmotives for community organization which we have just discussed, there\r\nare certain fairly obvious principles concerning the process of\r\norganization which deserve emphasis.\r\n\r\nThe first essential is to determine whether there are unsatisfied\r\ndesires which cannot be met except by community action and whether they\r\nare sufficiently desired to command the united support of the community.\r\nOnly as individuals and associations have common desires which cannot be\r\nsatisfied without their united activity can community organization be\r\neffected. The mere logical desirability of coördination of effort,\r\nhowever rational it may appear, is too abstract an objective to inspire\r\nenduring devotion. The allaying of antagonisms between special interests\r\nmakes no appeal to any of them until they are unable to achieve their\r\nends without joint action. Therefore, the primary consideration in\r\ncommunity organization is to determine what is the most important unmet\r\nneed of the community which requires united action for its satisfaction,\r\nand to enlist all possible elements in the common enterprise.\r\n\r\nA community must be thoroughly convinced of the need of some definite\r\nform of community organization before it can succeed. Sudden enthusiasm\r\ndue to the power of a persuasive speaker or a community meeting may\r\nresult in the formation of a community organization, but unless a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the people representing various interests are\r\nfirmly convinced of the need and are willing to pool their interests in\r\ncommunity activities, such an organization will be like many a convert\r\nof a revival meeting, it will soon \"backslide.\" To secure the\r\nrecognition of the need for concerted action by all elements of the\r\ncommunity will usually require time and education, and is a process\r\nwhich cannot be forced too rapidly--all education or learning involves\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nEven when an outstanding need is apparent it may not always be possible\r\nto gain the support of a sufficient portion of the community to justify\r\nan immediate effort for its achievement. It may be necessary to first\r\narouse good feeling and community spirit by some activity which, though\r\nrelatively less important, will command more general interest and\r\nparticipation, and may pave the way for other enterprises. The first and\r\nessential step in community organization is to get the community to act\r\ntogether, for only through collective activity is community spirit and\r\nloyalty developed. It is for this reason that Old Home Weeks, family\r\nreunions, athletic or play festivals, baseball teams, picnics, pageants,\r\ndramatics, community fairs, community Chautauquas, holiday celebrations,\r\nand kindred events are often the best means for creating better\r\ncommunity spirit.[86] It should be remembered that the objective of\r\ncommunity organization is not _an_ organization, but the active\r\ncoöperation of all the people and organizations of the community for the\r\ncommon welfare. The essential is common ideals and loyalties; the\r\nmechanism whereby these may be achieved is incidental.\r\n\r\nUntil genuine local leadership is available, community organization will\r\nbe impossible. It is true that often where the need for community\r\nactivity is sufficiently great that the very necessity develops new\r\nleadership. Herein lies the value of beginning the process of community\r\norganization by some enterprise which enlists the enthusiastic support\r\nof the whole community, for in such activities new leadership is often\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nAny form of community organization which is to be permanent and\r\neffective must represent the actual life of the community, which is\r\nlargely dominated by existing organizations. Most individuals are loyal\r\nto certain of these organizations and these loyalties are the social\r\nrealities which must be recognized in any attempt to unite them in\r\nlarger aims. Unless most of the leading organizations of a community can\r\nbe affiliated for community progress, any so-called community\r\norganization will be but another organization. The League of Nations\r\nhardly represents the world community as long as the United States,\r\nGermany and Russia are not affiliated with it, nor would our federal\r\ngovernment be representative of our national life if it were\r\nresponsible only to the direct vote of the people and did not give\r\nrecognition to the states as states. It is for this reason that\r\ncommunity organization will proceed most efficiently where it is\r\ninitiated by the joint effort of several of its leading associations,\r\nthe churches, the grange, the farm and home bureau, the Red Cross, the\r\nbusiness men's association, etc., for without their support a divided\r\nloyalty will persist.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason, a community organization cannot be under the\r\nauspices of any one existing organization as a chamber of commerce or\r\nfarm bureau. Both of these and others are community organizations, but\r\nthey are for specific purposes. Proponents of both of these have\r\nadvocated making them community-wide and all-embracing in their\r\nfunctions, but it needs but little reflection to show the impossibility\r\nof such a plan. To cite but one objection. The rural church is the most\r\ndeeply-rooted and in many ways the most powerful of rural institutions.\r\nIt can coöperate with these other organizations for community purposes,\r\nbut neither of them can enter into the religious field. The same is true\r\nof lodges, schools, health organizations, government, etc. Community\r\norganizations, such as the Chamber of Commerce or Commercial Club, the\r\nGrange and the Farm Bureau for agriculture and homemaking, the Red Cross\r\nfor its activities, Church Federations, and others should all be\r\nencouraged where needed, but although each of these has certain\r\ncommunity functions, no one of them can do or can direct the work of\r\nanother. The community organization must bring them together so as to\r\nbest coördinate their work for the good of the community, not through\r\nthe power of an organic federation, but through the influence of\r\nconference, good will and devotion to the common weal.\r\n\r\n3. _The Community Council._--Community organizations are, as yet, in an\r\nexperimental stage and their formal constitutions or by-laws are of many\r\ndifferent types.[87] The Community Council, as suggested by the National\r\nCouncil of Defense, has been adopted in many communities with various\r\nmodifications to meet local conditions. A community council consists of\r\none representative from each general organization which affiliates with\r\nit and of a variable number of members-at-large elected by the annual\r\ncommunity meeting. All citizens are entitled to vote for the\r\nmembers-at-large. The usual officers may be elected by the community\r\nmeeting, or, preferably, be chosen by the council itself. Thus the\r\ncouncil represents both the existing organizations and the community as\r\na whole. The council does not attempt any control over existing\r\norganizations, but merely provides a means for their voluntary\r\ncoöperation and is an agency for promoting community activities. In many\r\ncases where there are a large number of organizations, and it is\r\nsurprising how many are found in many average-sized rural communities,\r\nthe council will be too large to be an effective working body.\r\nFurthermore, the members who represent various organizations may not\r\nalways be the best persons to carry on the particular enterprises which\r\nthe council desires to promote. The council may, under such\r\ncircumstances, devote itself to the consideration of policies and\r\nenterprises, and may create committees of citizens who are best\r\nqualified and most interested in particular projects to have charge of\r\ntheir execution. Thus if the council decides to get back of a movement\r\nfor a playground, a public health nurse, and a band, committees would be\r\nappointed to take charge of organizing each one of these enterprises.\r\nThese committees should be selected so as to represent the various\r\norganizations most directly concerned with or interested in the\r\nparticular project as far as possible, but they should be chosen\r\nprimarily for their ability to produce results. Committees should be\r\nappointed only for those projects which the council decides to\r\nundertake, although one or two committees may be appointed merely to\r\ninvestigate suggested projects and to report their findings for further\r\nconsideration. Where the council is large, and it is not practicable to\r\nhave it meet more than once a quarter, it may be well to have its work\r\ncarried on in the interims by an executive committee consisting of the\r\nofficers and the chairmen of the committees.\r\n\r\nThere can be no one best type of community organization adapted to the\r\nwidely varying conditions of all sorts and sizes of rural communities;\r\neach community must have a form of organization adapted to its needs.\r\nThe important thing is not the creation of another new organization in\r\nthe community, but to afford the means for the better team play of those\r\nwhich already exist. The mechanism must therefore depend upon the\r\ncharacter and stage of development of the community and will be modified\r\nfrom time to time as its experience, or that of similar community\r\norganizations, warrants.\r\n\r\nFinally let us remember that community organization is not an end in\r\nitself, but that it is merely a means whereby conditions in the\r\ncommunity may be made such that every individual in it may have the best\r\npossible chance to develop his personality and to enjoy the fellowship\r\nof service in the common good. The aim of all social organization is\r\npersonality, but personality is achieved and can find its own\r\nsatisfaction only through fellowship. The ideal community but furnishes\r\nthe social environment in which the human spirit realizes its highest\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[84] Much of this chapter is a revision of parts of an article by the\r\nauthor entitled \"Some Fundamentals of Rural Community Organization.\"\r\nProceedings Third Natl.

New York, Association Press, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nCOMMUNITY PLANNING\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far we have been considering the community with regard to how its\r\npeople associate, with community psychology and behavior. But we must\r\nnot forget that the community has a physical basis. The buildings which\r\nhouse these associations at the community center, the church, the\r\nschool, the grange hall, the stores, with the roads which radiate from\r\nit and the farmsteads which they serve, these are the structures which,\r\nwith the natural topography of stream and hill, give material form to\r\nthe community and condition its life.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief difficulties in the development of rural communities in\r\nthe United States is that, like Topsy, they have \"just growed.\" Village\r\ncenters have sprung up here and there and gradually the surrounding\r\ncountryside becomes associated with them. As a result little\r\nconsideration has been given to planning the community either for\r\nefficiency or attractiveness. Sinclair Lewis' description of Gopher\r\nPrairie in \"Main Street\" may be overdrawn and unjust to many a rural\r\ncommunity, but it describes conditions which are so common that it has\r\naroused the public conscience concerning the lack of civic spirit in\r\nrural communities.\r\n\r\nA community is much like an individual. The man who is slouchy and\r\ncareless of his personal appearance is rarely a strong character. The\r\ncommunity whose cemetery is neglected, whose school grounds are a mass\r\nof mud and the outhouses a disgrace, whose lawns are unkept, where\r\nash-piles and neglected puddles fill the vacant lots, whose roads are\r\ntortuous and unimproved, whose farm houses are unpainted and whose\r\nbarnyards are more prominent than the door-yards--such a community is\r\nusually weak. It has little pride in itself or desire for improvement.\r\nIn the case of the man who is \"down and out,\" if we wish to give him a\r\nnew start, we encourage him to take a bath and a shave and we then\r\nfurnish him clean clothes, so that looking more respectable he may act\r\nthe part. Likewise in community improvement a \"clean up day\" is often\r\none of the best means of starting a new pride among its people.\r\n\r\nBut improving its looks will not remedy the more fundamental structural\r\ndefects which frequently handicap the rural community. Utility as well\r\nas beauty is essential in community arrangement. If the community is to\r\nescape ugliness and inconvenience, it will sooner or later come to the\r\ntime when it must definitely plan the arrangement of its streets and\r\nroads, its public buildings and its open spaces, so as to best serve all\r\nparts of the community. Community planning is as essential to\r\nsatisfactory \"community housekeeping\" as the plan of a house is for the\r\nconvenience of the home. An architect is needed to plan a home for the\r\ncommunity, a community structure which is mechanically sound and\r\nefficient and withal both beautiful and comfortable, just as much as for\r\ndesigning a house. So the art of \"town planning\" is extending from the\r\ncities to the country and some of our landscape architects who love the\r\ncountryside and appreciate its life and problems are giving their\r\nattention to rural community planning.[88]\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to enter into any extended discussion of the art\r\nof community planning, but we may well consider a few principles which\r\nare essential for realizing the ideals of community development.\r\n\r\nAs the community center is the nucleus of the community life, let us\r\nfirst consider the village plan.\r\n\r\nOne enters the community at the railroad station or by a main road. It\r\nis, of course, impossible to prevent the property adjoining a railroad\r\nfrom being the least attractive, because it is the most undesirable for\r\nresidence purposes; but it is entirely practicable to have a neat\r\nrailroad station with well-kept surroundings. Some of our more\r\nprogressive railroad companies have perceived that it is good business\r\nto make their stations and grounds attractive and most of them will be\r\nwilling to meet the local people halfway in an effort to improve their\r\nappearance. In far too many cases the grounds of the railroad station\r\nand the adjoining properties are the most neglected spot in the village\r\nand give an unfavorable impression of the community. Certainly we would\r\nthink a man queer who placed the back-door of his house to the street,\r\nbut the railroad station is usually the back-door of the community\r\ninstead of the main entrance as it should be. On the other hand, on\r\nalighting at a well-kept station, with a neat lawn, good walks and\r\nroads, which is not surrounded by the village rubbish heaps and\r\ndilapidated buildings, the newcomer feels that here is a place which\r\ninvites further acquaintance, while the native has a sense of\r\nsatisfaction rather than of apology.\r\n\r\nThe same principles apply to main road entrances to the village. The\r\nautomobile has greatly increased highway travel. Where a village places\r\na sign at its entrance \"Welcome to Smithville,\" and at its exit \"Come\r\nAgain,\" as is now frequently done, it not only makes a favorable\r\nimpression on the tourist, but it gives the community a sense of\r\nidentity. In New England these signs are frequently placed, at the\r\ntownship line rather than at the village boundary. In a few cases\r\nvillages have erected dignified stone pillars or arches at the entrance\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nThe building of state roads between village centers has almost\r\nnecessitated paving or hard roads in the village, for people resent\r\ntraveling over a good road in the open country and then plowing through\r\nmud holes in a village. Not infrequently the streets of the incorporated\r\nvillage are much poorer than the state roads outside the village and\r\nalthough incorporation formerly enabled the village to do its own paving\r\nand make other public improvements, the unincorporated village now has\r\nthe advantage of having its main roadways constructed as a part of state\r\nor county road systems at less expense to the villagers. In any event\r\nthe paving of the principal streets of the village should be considered\r\nan obligation of the whole community, not only of the village but of the\r\nfarm area surrounding it--_i.e._, the township, for on them the traffic\r\nof the whole community centers and in many cases the farmers of the\r\ncommunity do more actual hauling over the village streets than do the\r\npeople of the village. It is, of course, entirely proper, where state\r\nlaws permit, to assess part of the cost of village pavements on the\r\nabutting property, but it is short-sighted economy for farmers to object\r\nto sharing in the cost of such improvements in their community centers.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to a consideration of the general plan or layout of the\r\nvillage, it is obvious that in older communities it is hardly\r\npracticable to make material changes. In the old New England villages a\r\npart of the original town common has often been preserved as a \"common\"\r\nor park in the center of the village with a broad expanse of lawn and\r\nstately shade trees, while newer communities have frequently been laid\r\nout around a central open square. Here is the flagpole and the Soldiers'\r\nMonument or other historic memorials, and possibly a fountain or\r\nwatering trough, and sometimes a band stand. It is a place where\r\nopen-air meetings of all sorts, band concerts and community singing, may\r\nbe held. It is the modern substitute for the forum of the old Roman\r\ntown. When one compares a village which is merely strung along a main\r\nroadway, or two crossroads, with one which has such a civic center, he\r\ncannot but feel that the latter has a physical structure which gives it\r\nan identity and a common interest which is lacking in the former and\r\nwhich must mean much in the maintenance of community pride and which\r\nmust give much better opportunity for outdoor gatherings of all sorts.\r\nIn planning a new community such a public square should be a central\r\nfeature. Around it may be built the school, the town hall or community\r\nhouse, the churches, the library and other public buildings. If large\r\nenough it should include tennis courts and a playground. Where the main\r\nstreets are already occupied with business blocks and residences, it may\r\nbe possible to secure a square not far from the village center where a\r\nnew school building or community house may be erected and which may\r\ninclude a playground, bandstand, and whatever features are desired, even\r\nif it is necessary to place it at the edge of the village. Wherever\r\npossible the playground should adjoin the school building or community\r\nhouse, or both. Either as a feature of the playground or adjoining it,\r\nthere should be a baseball diamond and bleachers or grandstand. Such a\r\ncivic center will be found to be a powerful factor in the maintenance of\r\ncommunity pride and loyalty.[89]\r\n\r\nThe growth of automobile touring has encouraged the provision of camping\r\nsites for tourists on the edge of the village. Wherever a suitable\r\ngrove or other natural setting can be found nearby a village it should\r\nbe reserved as a public picnic ground or park. A part of this might also\r\nbe made available for a tourists' camp, and often it will be a good\r\nlocation for a ball diamond. There has recently been a steady growth of\r\ninterest in community fairs and such a picnic ground or park might well\r\nbe arranged with an open space adjoining it for fair and festival\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThese general features and facilities of the village plan are not simply\r\nfor the advantage or beautification of the village, but they benefit the\r\nlife of the whole community and should be considered as features of the\r\ncommunity's plant.\r\n\r\nWhen we leave the village center and survey the farming area of the\r\ncommunity, the most fundamental feature of its structure is the road\r\nplan. In hilly regions the location of roads is necessarily largely\r\ndetermined by topography, but over most of the Middle West the roads\r\nwere laid out on section lines at the time of the original surveys and\r\ntheir location has never been changed. One who has grown up in that\r\nsection feels a sort of pride in the straight roads and looks askance at\r\nthe crooked roads of the East, but as a matter of fact the latter are in\r\nmany cases much better located as regards their utility, for they were\r\nlaid out to reach certain centers by the most direct route. On the other\r\nhand, the location of the village centers of the Middle West was largely\r\ndetermined by the railroad stations, and the roads were located without\r\nregard to them. As a result it is almost always necessary to traverse\r\ntwo sides of a square in order to reach the community center. This\r\nmeans that such a route is forty percent longer from the corners of the\r\ncommunity than it would be by a straight line. This was bad enough with\r\ndirt roads, and if all the roads could be hard-surfaced, the automobile\r\nwould, of course, lessen the time required for travel. It is, however,\r\neconomically impossible to improve all minor roads and with the high\r\ncost of macadam, concrete, brick, or other hard-surface, not only for\r\noriginal cost but for upkeep, it seems absurd to continue to build the\r\nmain roads on rectangular lines rather than by the shortest route\r\nbetween the most-traveled points. The saving in cost of construction and\r\nmaintenance would much more than pay for the cost of all land which it\r\nwould be necessary to condemn for their right-of-way, and the saving in\r\ntime and cost of transportation for the whole community would amount to\r\na large sum every year. Far too little attention has been given by road\r\nengineers to community planning, and with the vast sums which are now\r\nbeing expended by the federal, state and county governments on permanent\r\nroads, it is of the utmost importance that this matter of road location\r\nwith regard to directness of access to the community centers should\r\nreceive much more careful study and better supervision by all the\r\nauthorities concerned, not only with regard to topography, but with\r\nregard to the social and economic welfare of the areas concerned. The\r\nnewer sections of the country, and particularly western Canada, have\r\nbecome aware of this lack of economy in road location and are giving it\r\nconsideration. In a report on Rural Planning and Development prepared\r\nfor the Canadian Commission on Conservation, Mr. Thomas Adams, the town\r\nplanning adviser of the commission, has outlined several plans for the\r\nbetter location of roads so that they will radiate from the community\r\ncenter and has shown that it is entirely possible to retain rectangular\r\nfarm plans with radial roads.[90] He summarizes his discussion of this\r\nmatter as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"The main points of contention in this chapter are:--That\r\n      the present system of surveying land for the purpose of\r\n      securing accurate boundaries to arbitrary divisions and\r\n      sub-divisions of land, while satisfactory for that purpose,\r\n      is not a method of planning land, but only a basis on which\r\n      to prepare planning and development schemes; that no\r\n      definite or stereotyped system of planning can be\r\n      satisfactory for general application; that all plans should\r\n      have regard to the physical and economic conditions of the\r\n      territory to which they apply and should be made for the\r\n      general purpose of securing healthy conditions, amenity,\r\n      convenience and economic use of the land; and that more\r\n      complete and adequate surveys and a comprehensive\r\n      classification of land is essential to secure successful and\r\n      permanent land settlement.\" (p. 71)\r\n\r\nAnother feature of community planning which is coming to receive larger\r\nattention is the preservation of unusual geological and scenic features\r\nfor the use of public. One of the scenic attractions most commonly\r\nneglected is the land along waterways. Sometimes the land on one side of\r\na stream is occupied by a road, but in many cases it is private\r\nproperty. If reserved to the public many of these watercourses might be\r\nmost attractive parkways. In many cases the control of waterways has\r\nbeen necessitated for the maintenance of the purity of the water supply\r\nand the advantage of having the adjoining land--usually more or less\r\nwooded--available for picnic parties has encouraged the extension of\r\npublic control of waterways. Several states now have legislation\r\npermitting counties or towns to acquire such areas for park purposes,\r\nand the Province of Ontario and some other Canadian provinces require\r\nthat a width of 66 feet be reserved around all lakes and rivers.\r\n\r\nIn order to utilize the waste land of the watersheds and to protect the\r\nshores of reservoirs and streams which furnish public water supplies,\r\nmany cities have reforested considerable areas, which will be maintained\r\nas public forests and will be cut as the timber becomes merchantable.\r\nThis movement has called attention to the practicability of establishing\r\ntown or community forests on cheap land unsuitable for tillage, as a\r\nsource of income to the community. Communal forests have existed in\r\nEurope for many centuries, and at the present time form 22 percent of\r\nthe forests in France. A movement has now commenced for the planting of\r\ntown forests in this country,[91] and the better utilization of the\r\ncommunity's waste land by planting it in timber should be considered a\r\nfeature of community planning.\r\n\r\nThe improvements effected in cities through city planning commissions,\r\nboth with regard to street location for the better routing of traffic,\r\nand the laying out of parks and the location of public buildings, have\r\nbeen so apparent, that the idea has been taken up by rural communities\r\nand a few states have passed legislation for the creation of special\r\nagencies for rural community planning. Thus Massachusetts has for\r\nseveral years had a Town Planning Commission and in 1919 Wisconsin\r\npassed an act[92] creating a division on rural planning of the State\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, and creating rural planning committees in\r\neach county. In 1920 thirty-six counties had organized such committees\r\nunder this law and had already accomplished much under its\r\nauthority.[93] Some of the more progressive land companies which are\r\ncolonizing new lands in northern Wisconsin are making definite community\r\nplans to encourage settlement,[94] and in California the State Land\r\nSettlement Board has done much to encourage better rural planning by the\r\ndemonstrations which it has made in its farm colonies at Durham and\r\nDelhi.[95] The Extension Services of several of the State agricultural\r\ncolleges have experts on landscape art who give assistance in the\r\nimprovement of public grounds and in community planning.\r\n\r\nA system of numbering farms has recently been invented which is based\r\nupon the relations of farms to their community centers and which\r\ntherefore makes necessary the definite location of rural community areas\r\nand their boundaries. This is known as the \"Clock System\" rural index\r\nand is now in use in four counties in New York State. The county map\r\npublished in the directory shows the different communities outlined by\r\nheavily shaded lines and the farm numbers radiate from the community\r\ncenters. On the map each community is divided as a spider's web into a\r\nnumber of small spaces by twelve dotted lines that extend from each\r\nvillage on the same radii as the hour-marks on the dial of a clock, and\r\nby concentric circles which are a mile apart from each community center.\r\nEach set of lines and circles extends to the community boundary, and the\r\nfarm is given a number which shows the sector in which it is located\r\nwith reference to the distance from the community center. In front of a\r\nfarm will be found a number, usually just below the mail box, such as\r\nAlton 3-2-K. This indicates that the farm is in the direction of the 3\r\no'clock mark on a clock, or east, of Alton; the second term, 2, shows\r\nthat it is between two and three miles from Alton and the letter K\r\nenables one to locate the individual farm on the small area between the\r\n3 o'clock and 4 o'clock radial lines and the two and three mile circles.\r\nIn the directory accompanying the map the names of all householders are\r\narranged alphabetically and also serially by their numbers, so that the\r\nname of the householder at a certain number of his location on the map\r\nmay be readily ascertained. This system not only makes necessary a\r\ndefinite determination of the center and boundary of every community,\r\nbut the number itself relates the farm to its community. This is a\r\nmatter of considerable importance, for since the abolishment of many\r\nrural postoffices the farmer's mail address may be on a rural route\r\nstarting from some railroad station or larger town which he visits only\r\noccasionally, and has no reference to the community in which he lives.\r\nThe system was invented by a Colorado farmer, Mr. J. B. Plato, who\r\ndevised it so that it might be possible for buyers to find his farm. As\r\nhe claims, such a number \"puts the farmer on the map\" and gives his home\r\na definite location just as does the street number of the city\r\nhouse.[96]\r\n\r\nFinally, in any effort toward community planning it must be remembered\r\nthat most rural communities are, in a way, but parts of what, for want\r\nof a better term, we may term larger communities. Not every small rural\r\ncommunity can support a library building, a hospital, a high school, a\r\nmoving picture theater, or a public health nurse. As has been pointed\r\nout in the previous chapters, these agencies can be maintained only at\r\nsuch centers as can command the support of several smaller communities.\r\nObviously they will tend to be located at the larger towns, such as the\r\ncounty seats. Roads should be planned with regard to making these larger\r\ncenters most readily available to their tributary territory. It would\r\nseem to be advantageous to the smaller communities to definitely relate\r\nthemselves to one of these larger centers in the support of some of the\r\nmore costly community services which they are unable to maintain, and an\r\nunderstanding should be developed between the smaller and larger\r\ncenters, whereby the latter will not attempt to displace the former. The\r\nlarger villages and towns must recognize that the smaller nearby\r\ncommunities are an economic and social asset and that the maintenance of\r\ntheir village centers is essential to successful community life. On the\r\nother hand, the smaller communities should recognize their own\r\nlimitations and should utilize the advantages of the larger centers\r\nwithout jealousy of them. The county library system and the county\r\nhospital illustrate the advantages to be obtained through the larger\r\ncommunity, but which are impossible without the support of the voters of\r\nthe smaller subsidiary communities.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of the community idea, and as communities become so\r\norganized that they have some mechanism for self-examination and\r\nself-expression, more study will be given to the physical structure of\r\nthe community as essential for economy and utility, and more pride will\r\nbe taken in making it beautiful and satisfying. Community planning is\r\nessential for the highest type of community development.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[88] For a most suggestive introduction to this whole field see Prof.\r\nFrank A.

Yet the man is\r\nmore than a body and the community is more than its material basis; the\r\nreal community consists of the men, women, and children living together\r\nin a restricted environment. Dr. R. E. Hieronymous has well expressed\r\nthe most fundamental aspect of the community when he says that its\r\npeople \"are coming to act together in the chief concerns of life.\"[97]\r\nThe life of the community consists of the common activities of its\r\npeople. There can be no community where there is no devotion to a common\r\ncause. The cause may be now one thing, now another, it may be worthy or\r\ndebasing, but in so far as the people of a locality are acting together\r\nin the support of various common causes they are living as a community.\r\nJust as the character of an individual is determined by his life\r\npurposes and the degree to which he conforms his behavior to them, so\r\nthe highest type of community is that in which its people are\r\nconsciously loyal to the common welfare and are \"coming to act together\"\r\nfor the common good. Like the character of an individual, the community\r\nis in process of becoming; it necessarily exists on an unconscious\r\nbasis, due to locality and heredity, but the strength of the community\r\nis measured by the degree to which its members become voluntarily loyal\r\nto common purposes.\r\n\r\nOutside of early New England the circumstances of settlement of the\r\nUnited States were not conducive to community development. Most of the\r\ncountry west of the Alleghanies was settled by individuals who secured\r\ntheir land from the federal government and whose prime allegiance was to\r\nthe nation. The federal government was the outgrowth of a revolution for\r\nthe right of self-government. Liberty and Freedom were its watchwords\r\nand the conditions of life of the pioneer settlers and their rapid\r\nspread over one of the richest natural areas in the world favored\r\nindividual independence. It was the natural reaction from the previous\r\ndomination of a feudal aristocracy. For over a century our national\r\nphilosophy has been dominated by a doctrine of rights, and only recently\r\nhave we come to perceive that if democracy is to function in a complex\r\nmodern civilization, there must be an equal emphasis on duties. This is\r\nthe significance of the present interest in instruction in citizenship\r\nin our schools.\r\n\r\nMost of us hardly appreciate how complete a reversal of the organization\r\nof rural life was involved in this sudden domination of individualism.\r\nPrimitive agriculture was made possible by men associating in small\r\nvillage communities for defense and mutual aid. Their whole system of\r\nagriculture, until very modern times, was controlled and directed, not\r\nby the individual or family, but by the community. The typical peasant\r\ncommunity of Russia or India was in many respects but an enlarged family\r\nand its economy and social control were based upon the customs of the\r\nfamily. Indeed, historically the community was the outgrowth of the\r\nenlarged family or clan. It is not surprising, therefore, that the\r\npeasant's first loyalty is to his community. The nation or state is far\r\naway and beyond his ken; his patriotism is for his home village. So Park\r\nand Miller in their discussion of immigrants' attitudes say: \"The\r\npeasant did not know that he was a Pole; he even denied it. The lord was\r\na Pole; he was a peasant. We have records showing that members of other\r\nimmigrant groups realize first in America that they are members of a\r\nnationality: \"I had never realized I was an Albanian until my brother\r\ncame from America in 1909. He belonged to an Albanian society over\r\nhere.\"[98]\r\n\r\nPrior to the last century the whole social organization of rural life in\r\nthe Old World was built up around the community. The family, the\r\ncommunity, and the state were the primary forms of human association.\r\nObviously, therefore, when families dispersed over the new territory of\r\nthe United States with no community ties and with but few contacts with\r\nthe national government, there was a lack of that social organization to\r\nwhich the people had been accustomed and through which their whole mode\r\nof life, their customs and moral code had been built up. These forms of\r\nhuman association, the family, the community, the state, have been built\r\nup very slowly through centuries of human strife and suffering; they\r\nrepresent the experience of the race as to the best means of adjusting\r\nhuman relationships. Break down an essential feature of the structure of\r\nhuman society, as was done when American settlers abandoned community\r\nlife, and men are compelled to find new methods of meeting their common\r\nneeds and of maintaining standards of conduct essential for their common\r\nwelfare. Had it not been for the influence of the school and the church,\r\nrural life over most of the United States would have inevitably\r\ndegenerated, for wherever there is no form of associated control there\r\nhumanity reverts to the level of the brute. Human life is what it is\r\nbecause for countless generations mankind has been learning how to\r\nadjust itself through association so that larger opportunity for the\r\nindividual is secured through a larger measure of well being for all.\r\n\r\nThe devotion of the American settler to his family eventually\r\nnecessitated his association for advantages which could be secured only\r\nthrough collective action. When he had subdued the land and established\r\nhis home, when he commenced to raise farm products for market rather\r\nthan primarily for support of the family, when better communication gave\r\nmore contacts with the town and city, the farm family developed new\r\nwants and interests which could only be satisfied through association\r\nwith others. We have already indicated the processes whereby the\r\neconomic situation, religious life, public education, the need of local\r\ngovernment, and the desire for recreational facilities, are inevitably\r\ndrawing the people of the countryside together at the natural centers\r\ninto communities. The locality group is again recognized as essential\r\nfor the best organization of rural life. But the new rural community is\r\na voluntary group, it is not determined by common control of the land or\r\nby common subjection to a feudal lord as was the village community of\r\nthe old world; its people are free to come and go where and when they\r\nwill. The community can compel only through the power of public opinion\r\nand its success must depend upon the voluntary loyalty of its people.\r\n\r\nThus the strength and the weakness of the community lies in the loyalty\r\nof its people. No community can permanently succeed whose people\r\nassociate in it merely for the advantages which they may gain. There\r\nmust be a genuine willingness to give as well as to receive, a real\r\ndesire to do one's share for the common life. Human association cannot\r\nsucceed on a basis of organized selfishness. The joy of family life\r\narises from the fact that each member is devoted to all and is willing\r\nto sacrifice personal interests for the family; without such devotion\r\nand sacrifice the true home is impossible. Just because human nature has\r\narisen through long ages of association, man finds no permanent\r\nsatisfaction in pursuing his own selfish interest; his greatest joy is\r\nfound in his devotion to others. All human association therefore depends\r\nupon loyalty and the higher and more complex the association, the more\r\nessential is the loyalty of its members. As Miss Follett has well said,\r\n\"Loyalty means the consciousness of oneness, the full realization that\r\nwe succeed or fail, live or die, are saved or damned, together. The only\r\nunity or community is one we have made of ourselves, by ourselves, for\r\nourselves.\"[99]\r\n\r\nHere social science and religion agree upon the ultimate objectives of\r\nlife. Professor Josiah Royce has shown[100] that the ideal of\r\nChristianity, the Kingdom of God, is but a universal community, what he\r\ncalls the \"beloved community,\" which is made possible through the\r\nloyalty of all to love and service. There is a fundamentally religious\r\nsanction to community loyalty and only an essentially religious motive\r\nwill inspire men to sublimate personal interests in devotion to the\r\ncommunity. Only through loyalty to the highest ideals of community life\r\ncan the Kingdom of God be realized on earth. No conceivable cataclysm\r\ncould make its existence possible without the voluntary allegiance of\r\nmankind, for the Kingdom of God is the kingdom of love; it can exist\r\nonly as the minds and hearts of men are devoted to it. Nor can the\r\ncommunity universal, the \"beloved community,\" be achieved except each\r\nlocal community adjusts its own life to the highest social values. The\r\ncommunity movement is but a means whereby the ideals of democracy and\r\nreligion may be given concrete expression in a definite locality. Unless\r\nthese ideals can be applied to local areas where it is possible to\r\nachieve some measure of common life, of community, there is little\r\nprobability of their realization in the world at large.\r\n\r\nBut these higher values of human life cannot be brought about by a mere\r\nprocess of organization. They require the dynamic of a religious\r\nconviction in the hearts of men. The Gospel and life of Jesus of\r\nNazareth furnish the essential inspiration for that spirit of loyalty\r\nwithout which all organization is in vain. Professor E. C. Lindeman has\r\nably expressed this in his discussion of the relation of the Community\r\nand Democracy:\r\n\r\n      \"The most formidable foe of Democracy, however, is the\r\n      confidence which people place in schemes and plans and forms\r\n      of organization. What the social machinery of our day needs\r\n      is spiritual force to provide motive power. The modern\r\n      Community Movement will fail to give Democracy its practical\r\n      expression if it is not motivated by a spiritual dynamic.\r\n      Such a dynamic force was unloosed with the message and life\r\n      of Jesus of Nazareth. He lived his life on the basis of\r\n      certain basic democratic assumptions, and He scientifically\r\n      demonstrated those assumptions. In His eyes all individuals\r\n      were of value; through the social implications of His\r\n      message sin became democratic and the burden of all; in His\r\n      aspirations all humankind were included. He assumed that\r\n      Love would solve more problems than Hatred. He even assumed\r\n      that to have a human enemy was a social anomaly. And He\r\n      believed that religion was essentially a system of behavior\r\n      by which the individual need not be swallowed up in the\r\n      group, but by which the individual must find ultimate\r\n      satisfactions in spiritualizing the group.\"[101]\r\n\r\nCommunity loyalty will give rise to a true provincialism which will do\r\nmuch to give smaller communities a satisfactory status and to make them\r\nmore independent in their standards and purposes. It is common to deride\r\nprovincialism, but what we deprecate is the inability of the provincial\r\nto associate with the outside world, and the city man may be as\r\n\"provincial\" as the farmer from the back hills. True provincialism, on\r\nthe other hand, is essential to the progress of civilization. The\r\ntendency of city life is toward imitation and reducing life to a dead\r\nlevel. Eccentricity may be objectionable, but without individuality of\r\npersons and communities life would be stupid and monotonous. There is\r\nprobably no greater need for strengthening rural life than a community\r\nloyalty which will prevent the unthinking imitation of urban life and\r\nwill take justifiable pride in local ideals and achievements. The need\r\nof a larger appreciation of the value of a true provincialism has been\r\nwell described by Professor Royce in his essay on \"Provincialism\":\r\n\r\n      \"Local spirit, local pride, provincial independence,\r\n      influence the individual man precisely because they appeal\r\n      to his imitative tendencies. But thereby they act so as to\r\n      render him more or less immune in presence of the more\r\n      trivial of the influences that, coming from without his\r\n      community, would otherwise be likely to reduce him to the\r\n      dead level of the customs of the whole nation. A country\r\n      district may seem to a stranger unduly crude in its ways;\r\n      but it does not become wiser in case, under the influence of\r\n      city newspapers and summer boarders, it begins to follow\r\n      city fashions merely for the sake of imitating. Other things\r\n      being equal, it is better in proportion as it remains\r\n      self-possessed,--proud of its own traditions, not unwilling\r\n      indeed to learn, but also quite ready to teach the stranger\r\n      its own wisdom. And in similar fashion provincial pride\r\n      helps the individual man to keep his self-respect even when\r\n      the vast forces that work toward industrial consolidation,\r\n      and toward the effacement of individual initiative, are\r\n      besetting the life at every turn. For a man is in large\r\n      measure what his social consciousness makes him. Give him\r\n      the local community that he loves and cherishes, that he is\r\n      proud to honor and to serve, make his ideal of that\r\n      community lofty,--give him faith in the dignity of his\r\n      province,--and you have given him a power to counteract the\r\n      levelling tendencies of modern civilization.\"[102]\r\n\r\nCommunity loyalty is largely dependent upon leadership. There is a\r\nreciprocal relation between loyalty and leadership; leaders inspire\r\nloyalty and loyalty incites leadership. Thus the amount of leadership in\r\na community and the willingness of its people to assume leadership are\r\ngood indices of community loyalty, and the willingness to work under\r\nleaders is its crucial test. The leader is essential to group activity.\r\nWithout a leader group activity is difficult or impossible. If men are\r\nto act together effectively some one must be spokesman and director.\r\n\r\nLack of leadership has ever been one of the chief handicaps of rural\r\nlife as compared with that of the town and city, and with the growth of\r\norganization the need of rural leadership is increasingly apparent.\r\nUntil very recently the vocation of agriculture has had but little call\r\nfor leadership. Successful farming required strict attention to the work\r\nof the farm and leadership brought no pecuniary advantage to the farmer\r\nas it did to the business or professional man. Furthermore there seems\r\nto be an innate desire for equality among farmers and a disinclination\r\nto recognize one of their number as in any degree superior, which\r\ndiscourages the development of leadership among them. The town and city\r\nplace a premium on leadership and a position of leadership gives a\r\nstatus which is coveted; but for the farmer any position of leadership\r\nis a burden or a public duty rather than an opportunity. For this reason\r\nthe control of government, education, religion, and all the larger\r\nassociations of life has been largely in the hands of urban leaders.\r\nThis has been inevitable and the lack of representation of the farmers'\r\ninterests has been incidental to the nature of his vocation.\r\n\r\nWhenever the need of adjustment to new conditions becomes sufficiently\r\nacute as to demand action for the preservation of interests of any group\r\nof men, the cause creates leadership; leaders either come forward or are\r\ndrafted and the successful leaders survive through a process of natural\r\nselection and receive recognition and support. This is what is now\r\noccurring in American agriculture. New conditions have forced farmers to\r\norganize for coöperative marketing and are necessitating the better\r\norganization of the whole social life of rural communities for reasons\r\nwhich have been previously indicated. With better education and with\r\nmore contacts with city life, farmers have come to appreciate that if\r\nthey are to compete with other industries and if the rural community is\r\nto have a satisfactory standard of living, they must develop their own\r\nleadership and that those who are qualified for leadership cannot be\r\nexpected to devote their time to the business interests of their fellows\r\nunless they are adequately compensated. On the other hand, there is\r\ngradually developing a new sense of responsibility for assuming\r\n_voluntary_ leadership in community activities, and a larger\r\nappreciation of the need of leadership and the duty of supporting it.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest benefits of the Extension Service and the Farm\r\nBureau Movement is the definite effort to develop local leadership and\r\nthe large measure in which this has been successful. The demonstration\r\nwork and coöperative organizations produce a new type of leader, for he\r\nmust be one who is successful in his own farm business and who\r\nunderstands the better methods of agricultural production and marketing\r\nif he is to be able to interest others in them and to wisely guide the\r\npolicies of his group. The successful agricultural leader must first of\r\nall be a good farmer, for the basic ideal of his group is the best\r\nagricultural production. Not infrequently an unsuccessful farmer who is\r\na good talker comes into prominence because he is willing to devote more\r\ntime to public affairs, but he rarely attains a position of real\r\nleadership in his own community, for being unable to manage his own\r\nbusiness he is unable to wisely direct that of the community.\r\n\r\nUnselfish leadership is the highest form of community loyalty and is\r\nessential for permanent community progress. There are obvious\r\nsatisfactions in leadership, but the true leader must have a clear\r\nvision, a strong purpose, and intense faith in his people, if he is not\r\nto become discouraged by the lack of loyalty in others and their slow\r\nresponse to his ideals. For the true leader must always be thinking in\r\nadvance of his community. It is his function to see what is needed for\r\nthe common good and then to gradually convince the group, and he must be\r\nwilling to withstand the criticism and rebuffs of those who are as yet\r\nunwilling to sacrifice temporary personal advantage for the common good.\r\nThe real leader will not attempt to do everything himself but will\r\nconstantly seek to discover leadership in others and to inspire them\r\nwith his own enthusiasm and faith in their ability. Not infrequently\r\nthis involves the supreme test of leadership, for the leader must be\r\nresponsible for the failure of his helpers, and although he may feel\r\nthat a given undertaking would be more certain of success were he to\r\nassume direct responsibility for it or place it in the hands of some one\r\nwho has demonstrated his ability, yet because of his belief in the\r\ndistribution of responsibility as essential for a strong community and\r\nbecause of his faith in the individual and in the undertaking, he takes\r\nthe risk and lends his influence to the success of the other. The\r\ndiscovery and training of leadership is one of the chief concerns of the\r\ntrue leader. Witness the devotion of the Master to the chosen Twelve and\r\nhis willingness to leave his whole cause in their hands.\r\n\r\nThe willingness to assume leadership is the acid test of community\r\nloyalty, for only through the development of a maximum of leadership can\r\nthe best life of the community be achieved. Every citizen has some\r\nability which qualifies him to lead some group, however small it may be,\r\nor however humble the cause. Indeed the highest type of community is one\r\nin which there is a conscious direction of community purposes through a\r\nbody of leadership which is divided among all its members, so that each\r\nfeels responsible to the whole community for the success of his share of\r\nthe common enterprise and has satisfaction in his contribution to the\r\ncommon achievement. In last analysis the success of the community rests\r\nupon the loyalty of its people as measured by their willingness to\r\nassume leadership in whatsoever capacity may best serve its interests.\r\n\r\nAs the farm people of the United States have more contact with towns and\r\ncities and as through better education and means of communication they\r\ncome into a larger participation in all the ranges of human culture,\r\nthey come to realize that only through collective effort can they secure\r\nmany of their new desires. Although many associations for special\r\ninterests attract their allegiance, their attachment to a locality and\r\ntheir common relation to the existing center of social activities, give\r\nrise to a devotion to the community, for only through the united effort\r\nof all interests can they realize their highest desires. Loyalty to the\r\nfamily is broadened into loyalty to the community, which finds its\r\nincentive and dynamic in devotion to the family. The family becomes less\r\nself-sufficient, but through its wider associations in the community,\r\nthe relations of the members of the family to each other assume new\r\nand--because they are more largely voluntary--higher values, and the\r\nfamily attains its highest development through the larger fulfilment of\r\nits members.[103]\r\n\r\nThe farmer no longer glories in his isolation, or magnifies the virtues\r\nof independence, for new conditions require the coöperation of the whole\r\ncommunity if farm life is to be made satisfying. Willingness and ability\r\nto work with others for the common good win social approval. Next to\r\ndevotion to the family, loyalty to the community is essential for the\r\nrealization of the best possibilities of rural life.\r\n\r\n          COMMUNITY SERVICE[104]\r\n\r\n    \"Strong, that no human soul may pass\r\n      Its warm, encircling unity,\r\n    Wide, to enclose all creed, all class,\r\n      This shall we name, Community;\r\n\r\n    \"Service shall be that all and each,\r\n      Aroused to know the common good,\r\n    Shall strive, and in the striving reach\r\n      A broader human brotherhood.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[97] \"Balancing Country Life,\" p. 60.

BUTTERFIELD THE FARMER'S BOOKSHELF\r\n\r\nEdited by DR. KENYON L. BUTTERFIELD, President, Massachusetts College of\r\nAgriculture. Each $1.25, by mail, $1.35.\r\n\r\nThe changing conditions and new problems in rural life are known in a\r\ngeneral way through newspaper and magazine articles, but few books have\r\nappeared which show what a force the farmer is and will continue to be\r\nin national and international life. This series is to contain books by\r\nmen who know the farmer as well as the subject; while written primarily\r\nfor rural leaders and progressive farmers they are interesting also to\r\nanyone who wants to keep up with contemporary history.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRANGE MASTER AND THE GRANGE LECTURER\r\n\r\nBy JENNIE BUELL\r\n\r\nAn account of the origin and ideals of the Grange and of what this\r\norganization has done and is doing. It also gives practical suggestions\r\nfor future development. Miss Buell had been active in the work of the\r\nGrange for 36 years. From 1890 to 1908 she was State Secretary of the\r\nGrange in Michigan, then lecturer until 1915, when she was again elected\r\nState Secretary.\r\n\r\n\"We have never read a book on The Grange which contains more practical\r\ninformation. Every member should read this book, and we should like to\r\nhave it read by town and city people, too.\"--_Rural New Yorker_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LABOR MOVEMENT AND THE FARMER\r\n\r\nBy HAYES ROBBINS\r\n\r\nThe labor question of factory and town crowds in upon the farm on every\r\nside--in the price of almost everything the farmer buys, in the freight\r\nhe pays, in the higher wages and shorter hours he must bid against for\r\nhelp. This book gives us the labor movement as it actually is, and what\r\nit proposes, as it affects especially the farmer.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years Mr. Robbins has been studying industrial problems. At\r\none time he was connected with the New York Central Railroad, and in\r\n1905 he undertook organization of the Civic Federation of New England,\r\ndevoted to the betterment of relations between employers and employees.\r\nDuring the war he assisted in the organization of the Committee on Labor\r\nAdvisory Commission to the Council of National Defense.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTY AGENT AND THE FARM BUREAU\r\n\r\nBy MAURICE CHASE BURRITT, Vice-Director Extension Department, New York\r\nState College of Agriculture, Cornell University.\r\n\r\nDespite its prominence during the past few years, the county agent farm\r\nbureau movement is not fully understood or appreciated either by the\r\ngeneral public or by farmers themselves. This book describes in detail\r\nthe work of the county agent and farm bureau and gives an historical\r\nsketch of their development.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FARMER AND HIS COMMUNITY\r\n\r\nBy DWIGHT SANDERSON, Head of the Department of Rural Social Organization,\r\nNew York College of Agriculture, Cornell University.\r\n\r\nThe rapid spread of the rural community idea, due in part to the recent\r\nwork of county agents and county farm bureaus, calls for a book which\r\ndescribes in plain terms just what this idea means and just how important\r\nit is in rural progress. This book does these two things in a way that\r\npromises to make it an important contribution to the farmers' thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGRICULTURAL BLOC\r\n\r\nBy HONORABLE ARTHUR CAPPER\r\n\r\nAn authoritative review of the difficulties and economic changes that\r\nled to the present situation in the United States Senate and an account\r\nof the present program among agricultural leaders. Senator Capper is the\r\nrecognized leader and proper spokesman of this movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN PRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY PLANNING\r\n\r\nBy FRANK A. WAUGH, Head of the Division of Horticulture and Professor of\r\nLandscape Gardening, Massachusetts Agricultural College.\r\n\r\nCountry Planning is not a fad involving the expenditure of sums of money\r\nfor useless \"frills\" but is a practical means of getting better results\r\nwith money that must be expended in such changes as disposition of lands,\r\nthe location of roads, the furnishing of playgrounds, forests, and school\r\ngrounds, etc. How these changes may be wisely directed is told in this\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN PREPARATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR SOIL WEALTH\r\n\r\nBy DR.
