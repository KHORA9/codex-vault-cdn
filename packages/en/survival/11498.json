Yarrow & Co., at Poplar, for the British\r\ngovernment, is one which is stated to be the fastest torpedo boat in her\r\nmajesty's navy. This boat has been put through its official trials; with\r\na load of 15 tons, running continuously for two hours without stopping,\r\na speed of 23 knots, which is equal to 26½ statute miles, an hour was\r\nobtained. The boat is 135 ft. long by 14 ft. beam. Its design is known\r\nas the Falke type, being in many respects similar, but very superior, to\r\na torpedo boat of that name which was built two years ago by the same\r\nfirm for the Austrian government. The form of the hull is of such a\r\ncharacter as to give exceptional steering capabilities; at the time of\r\ntrial it was found to be able to steer round in a circle of a diameter\r\nof 100 yards, averaging 62 seconds. The forward part of the boat is\r\ncompletely covered over by a large turtle back, which is the customary\r\nform of the boats built by Messrs. Yarrow & Co. It was first introduced\r\nin the Batoum, which they constructed eight years ago for the Russian\r\ngovernment. This turtle back increases the seaworthiness of the craft by\r\nthrowing the water that comes upon it freely away. It forms, also, good\r\nand roomy accommodation for the crew, and incloses a large portion of\r\nthe torpedo apparatus. The forward torpedo gear consists of one torpedo\r\ngun, adapted for ejecting the Whitehead torpedo by means of gunpowder,\r\nnow preferred on account of its simplicity. The boiler, one of Messrs.\r\nYarrow & Co.'s special construction, of a type which has undergone many\r\nyears of constant trial, is capable of developing 1,660 horse power. In\r\nthe engine room there are six engines--one for driving the boat, two for\r\ncompressing the air for the torpedoes, an engine for working the dynamo\r\nfor producing the electric light, an engine for forcing air into the\r\nstoke-hole, and an engine working in conjunction with the distilling\r\napparatus for supplying drinking water for the crew and the waste\r\nincidental to the boiler. Aft of the engine room come the officers'\r\nquarters. The stern of the boat is fitted up as a pantry and for the\r\nstowage of ammunition and stores. On the deck are mounted three machine\r\nguns, and near the stern an additional conning tower for use in case of\r\nneed, around which revolve two torpedo guns for firing the torpedoes off\r\neither side. These torpedo guns can be trained to any angle it may be\r\ndesired to fire them at. On both conning towers are machine\r\nguns.--_Illustrated London News_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE \"FALKE\" TYPE TORPEDO BOAT, AND SECTION SHOWING\r\nGENERAL ARRANGEMENT.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN NAVY--THE NEW GUNBOAT EBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gunboat Eber is an improved vessel of the Wolf type, but differs\r\nfrom other vessels of its class in that it has not a complete iron hull,\r\nonly the frame and deck beams being of iron, while the planking is of\r\nwood and yellow metal. No copper is used on the bottom. The \"composite\r\nsystem\" of building is looked upon with favor for ships of this kind,\r\nbecause iron vessels which are kept permanently at stations in the\r\ntropics soon become overgrown in spite of good care, and thus suffer a\r\ngreat loss of speed. In a wooden vessel the crew's quarters are better\r\nand more healthful than in iron vessels, for they are not as much\r\naffected by the temperature outside of the ship.\r\n\r\nThe greatest length of the Eber is about 245 ft.; its breadth, 26 ft.;\r\nits depth, 14 ft.; and it has a displacement of about 500 tons. The\r\narmament will consist of three long 5 in. guns in center pivot\r\ncarriages, and a small number of revolvers. One of the former will be\r\nplaced at the stern on the quarter deck, and the two others on the\r\nforecastle. Some of the revolvers will be on the quarter deck and some\r\non the forecastle, care being taken to arrange the guns so as to obtain\r\nthe widest possible range, thus enabling the ship to protect itself\r\nperfectly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW GERMAN GUNBOAT EBER.]\r\n\r\nThe Eber is provided with a two-cylinder, compound engine, which can\r\ngenerate 650 horse power, giving the vessel a speed of 11½ knots. The\r\ncoal bunkers are so large that the ship can travel 3,000 miles at a\r\nspeed slightly less than that just mentioned without requiring a fresh\r\nsupply of coal. The rigging is the same as in iron vessels of the Wolf\r\nclass, and the sails are sufficiently large to allow the vessel to\r\nproceed without steam. The ship will carry about 90 men, including\r\nofficers, crew, engineers, and firemen.\r\n\r\nA sum of $145,000 was appropriated for the construction and equipment of\r\nthe Eber, which was begun at Kiel in the latter part of 1885, and was\r\nlaunched February 15, 1887.--_Illustrirte Zeitung_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW BRITISH TORPEDO EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe torpedo experiments against the Resistance, which have been\r\nsuspended since November last, were resumed on June 9 at Portsmouth by\r\nthe officers of the Vernon. The injuries received by the ironclad in the\r\nprevious experiments having been repaired, so as to make the vessel\r\nwatertight, the old ship was towed up the harbor, and moored in Fareham\r\nCreek. Our readers are aware that the Resistance is an obsolete ironclad\r\nwhich has finished her career as a battle ship, and that nothing could\r\nhave converted her into a modern armorclad.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was intended to render the experiments final and conclusive\r\nas a practical demonstration under service conditions of the destructive\r\neffects of the Whitehead torpedo when directed against a modern vessel\r\nof war, the results still leave behind them much uncertainty. The\r\nResistance was built of iron, whereas battle ships are now exclusively\r\nconstructed of steel, and it would be perhaps hazardous to state that\r\nthe behavior of the two metals under a sudden and violent shock would be\r\nexactly the same. The construction of the double bottom of the old ship\r\nis also different. Since the last experiments were carried out against\r\nher, however, measures have been taken to make her as far as possible\r\nthe counterpart, so far as under water arrangements and coal protection\r\nare concerned, of a modern ship of war.\r\n\r\nAt the last attack, the Whitehead was directed against the after part of\r\nthe hull on the port side in wake of the boilers. During the present\r\nseries of experiments the old ship was assailed on the same side, but\r\ndirectly amidships, in the neighborhood of the engine room. As no steam\r\nwas got up in the boilers, the effect of the jar upon the steam pipes,\r\nglands, and feed connections remains a matter of speculation. So far as\r\nthe consequences of the burst upon the structure of the hull itself is\r\nconcerned, every care was taken to make the ordeal as complete and\r\ninstructive as possible. The wing passage, which has a maximum diameter\r\nof 3 ft. diminishing to a point, was left empty, although at the former\r\nexperiments the lower portions were filled with coal. But behind this,\r\nand at a distance of 8 ft. from the bulkhead, a longitudinal or fore and\r\naft steel bulkhead 3/8 in. thick had been worked to a length of 61 ft.,\r\nand, with the coal with which the intervening compartment was packed,\r\nformed (as in recent armorclads) a solid rampart, 20 ft. high, for the\r\ndefense of the engine room.\r\n\r\nThe height of the double bottom between the outer and inner skin plating\r\nis 2½ ft. The watertight compartments were divided into stations by\r\nmeans of vertical lightening plates pierced by three holes, and in order\r\nto make them, as far as was practicable, resemble the bracket frames of\r\na modern armorclad, the center of the plates was cut away so as to leave\r\na single oval hole instead of the three circular holes. In view of the\r\ndifferences of opinion which exist on the part of experts on the subject\r\nof under water protection, the officers of the Vernon had determined to\r\nsubmit the problem to the test of experiment. For this purpose steel\r\narmor 1½ in. thick had been worked along the outside of the upper skin\r\nof the double bottom throughout one of the compartments, in addition to\r\nthe other protection mentioned. The Resistance had been brought down by\r\niron ballast to a trim of 25 feet 9 in. aft and 19 ft. 7 in. forward,\r\ngiving a mean draught of 22 feet 8 inches. She was consequently rather\r\nfurther down by the stern than before, but was in other respects the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nWhen in commission, the Resistance had a mean draught of 26 feet 10\r\ninches. The present series of experiments was of even greater importance\r\nthan the first series. The attack was gradually developed by means of\r\nfixed and outrigger charges of increasing power, and the _coup de grace_\r\nwas not given by means of a service Whitehead in actual contact until\r\nvarious lessons had been derived.\r\n\r\nThe opening experiment on June 9 consisted of an attack directed against\r\na new system of torpedo defenses which are to be carried by ships in\r\naction, or when in expectation of an attack, rather than an assault upon\r\nthe ship herself. The previous experiments had clearly demonstrated that\r\na Whitehead, when projected against a vessel at close range, and\r\nconsequently with a maximum of motive force, could not get through the\r\nordinary wire netting before expending its explosive energy in the air,\r\nand that the spars by which the nets are boomed out from the ship's side\r\ncould be reduced to 25 ft. in length without danger to the hull. The\r\nordinary wooden booms employed on board ship, however, are heavy and\r\nunwieldy, weighing, as they do, more than half a ton each. In ordinary\r\ncircumstances, the spars cannot be lowered into place and the nets made\r\ntaut in less than a couple of hours, and the work of stowing them is\r\nequally slow and laborious.\r\n\r\nMr. Bullivant, who manufactures the torpedo netting and hawsers for the\r\nnavy, has devised a method of getting rid of the difficulties complained\r\nof by substituting steel booms for the wooden booms and an arrangement\r\nof pulleys and runners, whereby the protection can be run out and in,\r\ntopped and brailed up out of the way, with great facility. The system\r\nwas tried at Portsmouth last year with considerable success upon the\r\nDido, but as it was thought that some of the fittings were somewhat\r\nfrail and might collapse beneath the shock of a live torpedo, it was\r\nresolved to submit them to a practical test under service conditions\r\nupon the Resistance. The ship was consequently fitted with three of the\r\nsteel booms on the port side. They were 32 ft. long and spaced 45 ft.\r\napart, and connected by a jackstay to which the nets were attached. Each\r\nsteel boom weighed 5 cwt., or less than half the weight of the ordinary\r\nboom, and whereas the latter is fixed to the ship's side by a hook which\r\nis liable to be disconnected or broken by the jerk of an exploding\r\ntorpedo, Mr. Bullivant's boom works in a universal or socket joint,\r\nwhich cannot get out of gear except by fracture, and which permits the\r\nboom to be moved in any direction, whether vertically or fore and aft,\r\nclose in against the sides. Below each boom is a flange, which serves as\r\na line along which a traveler moves, the latter being actuated by means\r\nof a topping line running over a pulley at the head and another near the\r\nheel.\r\n\r\nUpon the booms being topped to a perpendicular position, the nets are\r\nattached to the runners at the bottom of the booms close inboard\r\n(instead of, under the existing system, to the tops of the booms from\r\nboats alongside or otherwise), and when this is done, the mere\r\ndepression of the booms into position will cause the nets to run out of\r\ntheir own accord. In like manner, when the occasion for their use has\r\npassed, the raising of the boom will cause the nets to come alongside,\r\nwhen they can either be brailed up through the grummets or disconnected\r\nfor future use.\r\n\r\nThe action of the gear is so simple and rapid that the torpedo\r\nprotection can be always ready without arresting the way of the ship. As\r\na length of net 30 ft. by 20 ft. deep weighs about 3 cwt., it will also\r\nbe seen that the reduction of strains by working the crinolines from the\r\nheel instead of the head of the booms is considerable. The attack by the\r\nWhitehead upon the booms and nettings was made shortly before 2 p.m., at\r\nthe time of high tide.\r\n\r\nThe whole affair occupied a very few minutes. As soon as the red pennant\r\nwas struck on board to show that Mr. Bullivant was satisfied with the\r\narrangements, and that the target was ready, the torpedo vessel Vesuvius\r\ngot under way, and after circling round the doomed hulk discharged a\r\nWhitehead against the netting from her under-water bow torpedo tube at\r\nan approximate range of 50 yards. As on former occasions, the missile\r\nwas one of the old 16 inch pattern, but it was understood that the\r\ncharge of gun cotton had been reduced to 87 lb., so that the net\r\nprotection should not bear a greater strain than would be the case in\r\nactual hostilities. The torpedo, which was set to a depth of about 10\r\nfeet, struck the net in the middle and threw up an immense spout of\r\nwater, but without getting to the ship, which was apparently uninjured.\r\nAlthough it hit the net immediately below the center boom, no fracture\r\noccurred, and the points remained intact. Although at the short range\r\nthe torpedo would spin through the water at from 30 to 40 horse power,\r\nand would deliver a formidable blow upon the net, the thrust was\r\neffectually resisted, though as a matter of course the net was much torn\r\nby the explosion of the baffled projectile.\r\n\r\nAlthough at the second torpedo attack made on the Resistance, the\r\nfollowing day, the offensive power that was brought to bear was quite\r\nexceptional, the victory remained with the ship. The charge exploded was\r\nan exceptionally heavy one. It consisted of 220 lb. of gun cotton. It\r\nwas consequently more destructive than any which is ever likely to be\r\nlaunched against an armorclad much better prepared to resist it than the\r\nobsolete and time-worn Resistance. An idea, however, had got abroad that\r\nthe Russians either have or intend to have a locomotive torpedo capable\r\nof carrying the same weight of explosive in its head, and the object of\r\nthe experiment was to ascertain what would be the effect of the\r\ndetonation of such an enormous charge upon the submerged portions of a\r\nship of war.\r\n\r\nBut, while this was no doubt the primary purpose in view, the experiment\r\nalso served the secondary purpose of determining the result of the\r\nexplosion upon the net defenses of a ship. Mr. Bullivant's booms and\r\nrunners, which were found to be scarcely anything the worse from the\r\nordeal of the previous day, were again used. The damaged net was taken\r\naway and one of the old service grummet nets slung in its place, the\r\ncylinders containing the gun cotton being attached to the jackstay\r\nimmediately in front of the battered sides, and 30 feet from the hulk,\r\nand sunk to a distance of 20 feet below the water line, which would\r\nbring it about opposite the bend of the bilge. By 3 p.m. everything was\r\nready for the explosion of the charge--everybody had cleared out of the\r\nship while the surrounding small craft drew off to a distance of 300\r\nfeet. The charge was electrically fired from a pinnace. The burst was\r\nterrific and the reverberation was heard and the shock distinctly felt\r\nin the dockyard. But the remarkable thing was that the hulk did not\r\nappear to jump in the least, though there was not more than six feet of\r\nwater under her keel. That she would not be seriously crippled by the\r\ndischarge seems to have been accepted as a foregone conclusion by\r\nCaptain Long and the other torpedoists, as the day for the third\r\nexperiment had been fixed in advance; but that the steel booms with\r\ntheir double flange running ways, stays, travelers, and hinges should\r\nhave resisted the tremendous jar and upheaval was a genuine surprise for\r\nall concerned, and goes far to prove that except a vessel be taken\r\nunawares, it will be impossible for a torpedo to come into actual\r\ncontact with it. At the experiments last year the wooden booms were\r\nunhinged and splintered under a much less violent shock. But the steel\r\nbooms employed, though somewhat bent, remained unbroken and in position,\r\nand the joints were quite uninjured. All that is necessary for perfect\r\ndefense is that the booms should be made a little heavier.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo experiments against the Resistance were resumed on June 13,\r\nwhen the old ironclad suffered some rough treatment. As the experiment\r\nwas understood to be the last of the second series, and was fully\r\nexpected to have a sensational termination, a considerable number of\r\ninterested spectators were attracted to the scene in Fareham Creek. The\r\ntorpedoists resorted to severe measures, but with a distinctly useful\r\npurpose in view, having bound the ship hand and foot, so to speak, in\r\nsuch a way that her name became a solecism. They exploded 95 lb. of gun\r\ncotton 20 ft. below the water, and in contact with her double bottom.\r\nThis amount of explosive represents the full charge of the old pattern\r\n16 in. Whiteheads; but as the hulk was, for prudential reasons, moored\r\nclose to a mud bank, and as the water was consequently much too shallow\r\nto allow of a locomotive torpedo being set to run at the required depth,\r\na fixed charge was lashed fore and aft against the bottom plating of the\r\nship and electrically exploded from No. 95 torpedo boat.\r\n\r\nIn previous experiments this year the ironclad was attacked on the port\r\nside, which had been specially strengthened for the occasion, and the\r\nresult was a victory for the defense. On June 13 the starboard side was\r\nselected for attack, in order that a comparison might be instituted with\r\nthe effects produced under different conditions by a similar experiment.\r\n\r\nLast year in the latter case the double bottom was filled with coal; and\r\nafter the charge, which was lashed against the ship in the same way, had\r\nbeen exploded, it was found that the bilge keel had been shivered for a\r\nlength of 20 ft., while the lower plating had been much bulged above the\r\nbilge keel. Four strakes of the skin plating extending up to the armor\r\nshelf had also been forced inward and fractured where they crossed the\r\nlongitudinal frames. They had parted in the middle for a distance of 8\r\nft., while some of the butts had been opened so that gashes 2 in. or 3\r\nin. wide appeared between them. The coal had been pulverized and\r\nscattered in all directions, and other internal damage inflicted.\r\nNevertheless, the watertight bulkheads remained intact, and by confining\r\nthe influx of water to a single compartment so much buoyancy was\r\npreserved that, though the ship heeled over to starboard and was maimed,\r\nshe remained afloat, and might have continued to fight her guns,\r\nprovided always that no injury had been sustained by her machinery, a\r\npoint which these experiments do not touch. Crippled, however, as she\r\nwas, it was thought at the time (and the probability was strengthened by\r\nsubsequent examination of the ship in dock) that the coal, instead of\r\nbeing a protection to the double bottom, had in reality proved a source\r\nof weakness by receiving the energy of the explosion from the outer\r\nplating and communicating it to the inner plating, and so distributing\r\nit throughout the submerged portions of the hulk.\r\n\r\nThe question was sufficiently important to demand an experimental\r\nsolution; hence the _raison d'etre_ of the present demonstration. The\r\ndouble bottom, which is about 2½ ft. deep, was consequently kept empty,\r\nand the torpedo placed in immediate contact with it in such a manner\r\nthat, being overhung by the contour of the hull, the ship would feel the\r\nfull force of the upward as well as the lateral energy of the charge. On\r\nother accounts the importance of the experiment was obvious, for,\r\nalthough it had been ascertained that torpedo nets were capable of\r\nprotecting a battle ship from the bursts of the heaviest locomotive and\r\noutrigger charges, it might happen, of course, that the nets would be\r\nrent or displaced by shell fire or swept away by a grazing ram or even\r\nattacked by a double torpedo, the second passing through the gashes made\r\nby the explosion of the first in any case. It was, therefore, of urgent\r\nnecessity that the effect of a torpedo bursting in immediate contact\r\nwith a ship's bottom should be practically and clearly determined. The\r\ncharge on June 13 was fired just before 5 p.m. in the wake of the\r\nboilers, and it was soon perceived that something of a fatal character\r\nhad taken place from the appearance of coal dust sweeping up through the\r\nhold. The report had not the dull boom to which the spectators had\r\nbecome accustomed. Instead of this, the gun cotton exploded with a\r\nsharp, angry, whistling noise, while the manner in which the mud was\r\nchurned up showed that the force of the rebound was terrific. The ship\r\nlifted bodily near the stern, after which it was seen to leisurely heel\r\nover to starboard some eight or ten degrees, and finally repose, though\r\nnot until the tide fell, upon the mud. The old hulk had been mortally\r\nwounded at last.\r\n\r\nA complete knowledge of the disaster which has overtaken her (says the\r\ncorrespondent of the London _Times_, to which we are indebted for the\r\nabove particulars) will not be obtained until a careful investigation\r\nhas been made of the hull in dock. But, from a hasty exploration which\r\nwas conducted on board, it was evident that the shot had not only\r\ndislocated the inner plating of the double bottom, but had penetrated\r\nthe bunker compartment, stored as it was with coal, that the watertight\r\ndoors and compartments had ceased to operate, and that water was flowing\r\ninto the hull through a hundred crevices. To such an extent was this the\r\ncase that, though a strong working party was at hand ready for any\r\nemergency, it was deemed useless to attempt to free the ship of water\r\nuntil her gashes had been temporarily closed from outside. When this has\r\nbeen done, she will be pumped out and brought into dock for careful\r\nexamination. From what has been said, it will be seen that while the\r\nexplosion of 95 lb. of gun cotton in actual contact last November simply\r\ncrippled the Resistance, the explosion of a like charge at the same\r\nspot, and under approximately the same conditions, has in this instance\r\nnot simply disabled, but really sunk the ship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ENGLISH CAR COUPLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new automatic railway coupling illustrated below is the invention of\r\nMr. Richard Hill, and has been practically developed by Mr. B.H.\r\nThwaite, of Liverpool. It will be seen that the system is somewhat\r\nsimilar to the parallel motion when in action.\r\n\r\nThe catch and peculiarly shaped hooks slide over the cross and catch\r\nbars. These latter turn horizontally on a central pivot attached to the\r\njaw end of the drawbar. The cross catch bars adjust themselves to the\r\ndirection of the line of pull in the drawbar. The cranking of the\r\ndrawbar allows for the deflection of the buffer springs.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of uncoupling, or throwing hooks out of gear, is\r\nextremely simple and effective. The cranked part of the rod passing\r\nacross the end of the wagon, and with handles at each end workable from\r\nthe 6 ft. way, is attached to the catch hooks by means of a light chain.\r\nOn throwing the handle over, and against the end of the wagon, the crank\r\nmoves over and below the center, lifting up the catch into a position\r\nout of range of action, and from this position it cannot fall except it\r\nis released by the shunter. A shackle and links hang from the end of the\r\ndrawbar for attachment to ordinary wagons.\r\n\r\nAfter a long and costly series of experiments the form of coupling shown\r\nin illustration was adopted. Part of the experimental couplings used\r\nwere made by the Hadfield Steel Foundry Company, but the couplings used\r\nat a recent trial at Gloucester were forged by the Gloucester Wagon\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ENGLISH CAR COUPLING.]\r\n\r\nThe trial couplings were applied to old and worn-out coal wagons,\r\nvarying in relative heights and widths of buffers, and the tests were:\r\n\r\n1. Coupling and uncoupling, and passing coupled round curves of less\r\nthan two chains radius. 2. Coupling under rapid transit movement and\r\nviolent shock. 3. Coupling under slow movement, the wagons being shunted\r\ntogether by two shunters. 4. Wagons brought violently together while the\r\ncoupling hooks were lifted out of action, to test the rigidity of the\r\nhooks in this position. 5. Tested in competition with the ordinary\r\ncoupling stock.\r\n\r\nThe trial was a success. The new automatic coupling satisfactorily\r\nunderwent the various conditions, and it was proved that: 1. It can be\r\nlifted out of action with one hand and quite easily. 2. It can be\r\ncoupled and uncoupled six times as fast as with the pole hook in the\r\ndaytime. At night this advantage would be considerably increased.\r\n\r\nThe coupling is strong as well as elastic in its parts, and adjusts\r\nitself to the various conditions of traction.--_Engineering_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Continued from SUPPLEMENT, No. 597, page 9539.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGAZINE RIFLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chaffee-Reece Magazine Rifle_.--We do not insert a drawing of this\r\narm--one of the three selected by the American board--as it belongs to\r\nthe same class and is similar in general construction to the Hotchkiss.\r\nThere is, however, an important difference in the magazine, which has no\r\nspiral spring, but is furnished instead with an ingenious system of\r\nratchet bars. One of these carries forward the cartridge a distance\r\nequal to its own length at each reciprocal motion of the bolt, while a\r\nsecond bar has no longitudinal motion, but prevents the cartridges from\r\nmoving to the rear in the magazine tube after they have been moved\r\nforward by the other bar. The magazine is loaded through an aperture in\r\nthe butt plate, the opening of the spring cover of which causes the two\r\nratchet bars to be depressed, so that the magazine can be filled by\r\npassing the cartridges along a smooth middle bar. The act of closing the\r\nspring cover again brings the two ratchet bars into play.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--KROPATSCHEK MAGAZINE GUN]\r\n\r\nBy means of a cut-off the ratchet bars can be prevented from acting, and\r\nthe piece used as a single loader.\r\n\r\n_Kropatschek Magazine Rifle_.--This rifle, which is the small arm of the\r\nFrench navy, has a bolt-action rifle resembling the Gras (see Fig. 9).\r\n\r\nThe magazine is a brass tube underneath the barrel, as in the\r\nWinchester, Vetterli, Mauser, and other rifles of class 1. It contains\r\nsix cartridges, while a seventh can be placed in the trough or carrier,\r\nT.\r\n\r\nWhen the breech is opened by pulling back the bolt, a projection on the\r\nlatter strikes the carrier at N, causing its front extremity to raise\r\nthe cartridge into the position shown in the section. This movement is\r\naccelerated by the spring, A, acting against a knife-edge projection on\r\nthe trough, T; in the upper position of the trough, the spring acts upon\r\none face of the angle, and upon the other face when in the lower\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nOn closing the breech, the bolt pushes the cartridge into the chamber,\r\nand when the handle is locked down to the right, a part of the bolt\r\npresses against a stud, and thus depresses the trough to be ready to\r\nreceive another cartridge from the magazine.\r\n\r\nThe magazine can be cut off and the rifle used as a single loader by\r\npushing forward a thumb-piece on the right side of the shoe. The effect\r\nof this is that, on turning down the handle to lock the bolt, the latter\r\ndoes not act on the stud to depress the carrier, so that no fresh\r\ncartridges are fed up from the magazine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--LEE MAGAZINE GUN]\r\n\r\nThere is a projection, Z, on the fore part of the carrier, which keeps\r\nthe next cartridge from leaving the magazine while the trough is in the\r\nupper or loading position. A supplementary cartridge stop, R, pivoted at\r\nP and having a spring, L, underneath it, acts in conjunction with Z in\r\nretaining the cartridges in the magazine, and especially in preventing\r\nmore than one at a time from passing out into the carrier when the\r\nlatter is depressed; it also retains the cartridges in the magazine tube\r\nwhile the latter is being filled.\r\n\r\n_Lee Magazine Rifle_.--This arm (see Fig. 10), which occupied the place\r\nof honor in the report of the American \"Board on Magazine Guns,\"\r\nembodied two new principles of considerable importance, viz., the\r\ncentral position of the magazine, and having it detachable with ease, so\r\nthat two or more magazines can be carried by the soldier.\r\n\r\nThe breech action of the Lee does not materially differ in design from\r\nother bolt rifles, except that the bolt is in two pieces only--the body,\r\nor bolt proper, and the hammer or cocking-piece. The firing pin, or\r\nstriker, is screwed into the hammer; the spiral main spring, which\r\nsurrounds the striker, is contained in a hollow in the body. The handle\r\nis placed at the rear end of the bolt, and bent down toward the stock,\r\nso as to allow the trigger to be reached without wholly quitting hold of\r\nthe bolt. The extractor is so connected with the bolt head as not to\r\nshare the rotation of the latter when the handle is turned down into the\r\nlocking position. When the handle is turned up to unlock the bolt, the\r\nhammer is cammed slightly to the rear, by means of oblique bearings on\r\nthe bolt and hammer, so as to withdraw the point of the striker within\r\nthe face of the bolt. This oblique cam action also gives great power to\r\nthe extractor at first starting the empty cartridge case out of the\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nThe magazine, M, is simply a sheet iron or steel box of a size to hold\r\nfive cartridges, but there seems no reason why it should not be of\r\nlarger dimensions. It is detachable from the rifle, and is inserted from\r\nunderneath into a slot or mortise in the stock and in the shoe, in front\r\nof the trigger guard. A magazine catch, C, just above the trigger guard,\r\nengages in a notch, N, in the rear of the magazine, the projection, L,\r\nfirst entering a recess prepared for it in the shoe. There is a magazine\r\nspring, D, at the bottom of the magazine box which pushes the cartridges\r\nup into the shoe. The point of the top cartridge is pushed into the\r\nprojection, L, and this keeps the lower cartridges in their places in\r\nthe box while the latter is detached; when the magazine is inserted in\r\nthe rifle, the withdrawal of the bolt causes the top cartridge to be\r\nslightly drawn back, so that it is now free to be fed up into the shoe\r\nby the magazine spring, D.\r\n\r\nThere is a later pattern of magazine, which has its front face quite\r\nplain, with no projection, L, as the magazine catch was found sufficient\r\nto hold the box in its place. To prevent the cartridges being pressed\r\nout of the magazine before the latter is inserted in the rifle, there is\r\na strong spring placed vertically in one side of this box, the curved\r\nupper end of which bears upon the top cartridge; when the magazine is in\r\nits place in the shoe, this side spring is so acted upon that it ceases\r\nto hold down the cartridges in the box.\r\n\r\nTo use the rifle as a single loader, formerly the magazine had to be\r\ndetached, when a spring plate in the shoe, which is pushed aside by the\r\ninsertion of the magazine, starts back into its place and nearly fills\r\nthe magazine slot, so as to prevent cartridges falling through to the\r\nground when fed into the chamber by hand. The later pattern, however,\r\nhas two notches on the magazine for the catch, C, to engage in. When the\r\nmagazine is inserted in the slot only as far as the upper notch, the\r\nrifle can be used only as a single loader, but on pressing the box home\r\nto the second notch, the magazine immediately comes into play.\r\n\r\nThe magazine can be released from the slot by an upward pressure on the\r\nlower projecting end of the magazine catch, C, which is covered by the\r\ntrigger guard.\r\n\r\n_Improved Lee_.--This rifle is precisely similar in principle to the\r\nLee, the chief difference being that the magazine is permanently fixed\r\nin its slot underneath the shoe, and in front of the trigger guard. The\r\ncartridges are inserted from above. There is a stop by means of which\r\nthe cartridges can be prevented rising up into the shoe, and which forms\r\na sort of false bottom to the slot in the latter, so that the arm can be\r\nused as a single loader.\r\n\r\n_Lee-Burton_.--The bolt action is the same as the Lee, but the box\r\nmagazine is attached to the right side of the shoe, instead of being\r\nunderneath, as in that rifle. When the magazine is raised to its higher\r\nposition, the cartridges pass successively into the shoe by the action\r\nof gravity alone, and are thus pressed home into the chamber by the\r\nclosing of the bolt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nA number of the Lee-Burton and improved Lee rifles are now being\r\nmanufactured for issue to the troops, in order to undergo experimental\r\ntrials on an extended scale.\r\n\r\nSeveral other magazine rifles have the box central magazine, but placed\r\nin different positions as regards the shoe and the axis of the bore. In\r\nthe original pattern of the Jarman (Sweden and Norway), the magazine is\r\naffixed to the upper part of the shoe, inclined at a considerable angle\r\nto the right hand (see vertical cross section, Fig. 11). Here the\r\noperation of gravity obviates the necessity of a magazine spring, but\r\nthe magazine was found to be very much in the way and liable to be\r\ninjured. It has therefore been replaced by a magazine underneath the\r\nbarrel, as in the Kropatschek and other rifles.--_Engineering_.\r\n\r\n(_To be continued_.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATIVE LIQUID.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a few weeks' preservation of organic objects in their original form,\r\ndimensions, and color, Prof. Grawitz recommends a mixture composed of 2½\r\nounces of chloride of sodium, 2¾ drachms of saltpeter, and 1 pint of\r\nwater, to which is to be added 3 per cent. of boric acid.--_Annales des\r\nTravaux Publics_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKENT'S TORSION BALANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States Torsion Balance Company, of New York, has recently\r\nbrought before the public a new form of balance which presents so many\r\ningenious and excellent features that we illustrate it below, on the\r\npresent page. The instrument in its simplest form is shown in Fig. 1. It\r\nconsists of a beam, A, which is firmly attached to a wire or band, B, at\r\nright angles to it, and which wire is tightly stretched by any\r\nconvenient means. Then, since the wire and beam are both horizontal in\r\ntheir normal position, and since the center of gravity of the beam is\r\nimmediately above or below the middle line of the wire, the torsional\r\nresistance of the latter tends to keep the beam horizontal and to limit\r\nits sensitiveness. When the beam is deflected out of its horizontal\r\nposition and the wire thereby twisted, the resistance to twisting\r\nincreases with the arc of rotation. To counteract this resistance and to\r\nrender the beam sensitive to a very slight excess of load at either end,\r\na poise, D, is attached to the beam by a standard, C, which poise\r\ncarries the center of gravity of the structure above the axis of\r\nrotation. This high center of gravity tends to make the beam \"top\r\nheavy,\" or in unstable equilibrium. By properly proportioning the poise\r\nand its distance above the wire to the resistance of the wire, the\r\ntop-heaviness may be made to exactly neutralize the torsional\r\nresistance, and when this is done the beam is infinitely sensitive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KENT'S TORSION BALANCE. Fig 1.]\r\n\r\nThe moment of the weight or its tendency to fall increases directly as\r\nthe sine of the arc of rotation, while the torsional resistance\r\nincreases as the arc, and for small angles the sine and the arc are\r\npractically equal.\r\n\r\nWhen arranged as in Fig. 1, the scale is balanced only when the center\r\nof gravity of the structure is vertically above the middle line of the\r\nwire, and the support of the scale must be leveled in the direction of\r\nthe beam, so as to cause the center of gravity to take this normal\r\nposition. After the scale is thus leveled, if from any cause whatever,\r\nsuch as shifting the scale on a table, or shifting the table itself, the\r\nscale support is thrown out of level, the center of gravity of the poise\r\nand beam is shifted from the vertical line above the support, and its\r\nmoment immediately becomes greater than the torsional resistance, and\r\nthe beam tips out of balance, and cannot be used as a correct scale\r\nuntil the support is again leveled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KENT'S TORSION BALANCE. Fig 2.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the foregoing facts, it was reserved for the\r\n\"Encyclopedia Britannica,\" in its ninth edition, to use the following as\r\nthe result of its condensed wisdom:\r\n\r\n\"In the torsion balance proper, the wire is stretched out horizontally,\r\nand supports a beam so fixed that the wire passes through the center of\r\ngravity. Hence the elasticity of the wire plays the same part as the\r\nweight of the beam does in the common balance. An instrument of this\r\nsort was invented by Ritchie, for the measurement of very small weights,\r\nand for this purpose it may offer certain advantages; but clearly if it\r\nwere ever to be used for measuring larger weights, the beam would have\r\nto be supported by knife edges and bearing, and in regard to such\r\napplications therefore (as in serious gravimetric work), it has no\r\n_raison d'etre.\"_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KENT'S TORSION BALANCE. Fig 3.]\r\n\r\nThis would seem to settle the whole case, for if the encyclopedia says\r\nit has no reason to be, then, like the edict of the Mikado, it is as\r\ngood as dead, and if that is the case, \"Why not say so?\" On the\r\ncontrary, the torsion balance seems very much alive. But as it is not\r\nvery generally known, perhaps the early history of this form of balance,\r\nbriefly sketched, may prove of interest.\r\n\r\nOne of the first forms of the torsion balance which met the disapproval\r\nof the \"Encyclopedia Britannica\" was attended with the difficulty that\r\nthe pivoted wires were attached directly to the bifurcated ends of the\r\nbeam, and could not be tensioned without bending these ends unless the\r\nbeam was made so heavy as to interfere with its employment in delicate\r\nweighing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KENT'S TORSION BALANCE. Fig 4.]\r\n\r\nThe next step was the substitution of light forms stiffened by the wires\r\nbeing tensioned over them. This was the invention of Professor Roeder,\r\nrecently deceased. The next step was the common counter scale, and then\r\nthat form of letter scale in which one of the bands acts as a fulcrum\r\nand the other as a pivot.\r\n\r\nAfter Professor Roeder's death, Dr. Alfred Springer, of Cincinnati,\r\ncontinued perfecting this invention, and with marked success--scales not\r\nintended for anything but the weighing of the ordinary articles of a\r\ngrocery store working so accurately that up to 50 lb. two grains would\r\nturn the balance.\r\n\r\nAs will be noted, this balance dispenses entirely with knife edges, and\r\nthis statement carries with it the gist of its entire merit. There is no\r\nfriction, and the elegance of the work and the nice adjustments of the\r\nparts struck the writer at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KENT'S TORSION BALANCE. Fig 5.]\r\n\r\nThe prescription scale and the proportional scale (see Fig. 4) are\r\nparticularly interesting. The former is sensitive to 1/64 of a grain,\r\nand the latter, invented by Mr. Kent, is a most ingenious method for\r\nweighing, by which, in a small compass (10½ in. by 4¼ in. by 3¾ in.), we\r\nhave a balance capable of weighing 3 lb. avoirdupois by thirty-seconds\r\nof an ounce.\r\n\r\nFor ordinary balances on the torsion system, in which extreme\r\nsensitiveness is not needed, the trouble caused by change of level of\r\nthe scale is insignificant; but it becomes a matter of importance in\r\nmore sensitive scales, such as fine analytical balances in places where\r\nit is impossible to keep the table or support of the scale level, for\r\ninstance on shipboard.\r\n\r\nTo counteract this effect of the change of level, Dr. Alfred Springer\r\ndevised the system which is shown in its most elementary form in Fig. 2.\r\nAn additional beam, E, with wire, F, and poise, H, on support, C, were\r\nadded to the balance, and connected to it by a jointed connecting piece,\r\nJ. The moment of the structure, E C H, about its center of rotation was\r\nmade equal to the moment of A C D about the center. The wires, B and F,\r\nare attached at their ends to supports which are both rigidly connected\r\nto the same base or foundation. If this base, the normal position of\r\nwhich is horizontal, is tipped slightly, the weights, C and H, will both\r\ntend to fall in the same direction. But suppose the right hand end of\r\nthe base is raised, causing both of the weights to tip to the left of\r\nthe vertical, D, tending to fall over, the left tends to raise the right\r\nhand end of the beam, and the connecting piece, J H, also tending to\r\nfall to the left, tends to lower the left hand end of E and the piece,\r\nJ. The moments of the structure, E C H, and A B D being equal, and one\r\ntending to raise J and the other to lower it, the effect will be zero,\r\nand J will remain in its normal position.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all necessary, however, to have the weights and dimensions\r\nof the structure, E C H, equal to those of A B D. All that is necessary\r\nis that the components of the weight of each part of the structure which\r\nact vertically on J shall be equal and opposite. For, if the left end of\r\nthe beam, E, is made shorter than the right end of the beam, A, a given\r\nangle of rotation of the beam, A, will cause a greater-angle of rotation\r\nof E, consequently will tip the weight, H, further from the vertical\r\nthan the weight, D, is tipped, and in that case the weight, D, must be\r\nmade smaller than H, to produce an equal and opposite effect upon J. In\r\npractice it is convenient to make the beam, E, only one-fifth to\r\none-twentieth as long as A, and to correspondingly reduce the weight, H,\r\nrelatively to D. In this case, on account of the angle of rotation of\r\nthe beam, E, being greater than the angle of rotation of A, the beam, E,\r\nbecomes a multiplier of the indications of the primary beam, A.\r\n\r\nMr. Kent has devised a modification of Dr. Springer's system, which is\r\nshown in Fig. 3. It is applied in those varieties of the torsion balance\r\nin which there are two parallel beams, connected by either four or six\r\nwires. The wire, F, carrying the secondary beam, E, and poise, H,\r\ninstead of being carried on an independent support, rigidly attached to\r\nthe base, as above described, is attached directly to a moving part of\r\nthe balance itself, and preferably to the two beams. In Fig. 3, T T T\r\nare trusses over which are tightly stretched the wires, B B B. A A' are\r\ntwo beams rigidly clamped to the wires; _t_ is another truss with\r\nstretched wire, F F¹. The upper wire, F', is attached by means of a\r\nflexible spring and standard, S, to the upper beam, and the lower wire\r\nis attached either directly or through a standard to the lower beam. The\r\nsecondary poise, H, is rigidly attached to the truss, _t_. The secondary\r\nbeam, E, is also rigidly attached to the truss, and acts as a\r\nmultiplying beam. The secondary structure thus completely fills two\r\nfunctions: First, that of multiplying the angle of rotation and thereby\r\nincreasing the apparent sensitiveness of the scale, and, second, that of\r\novercoming the effect of change of level. The secondary beam may be\r\ndispensed with if a multiplier is not needed, and the secondary truss,\r\n_t_, with its standard and counterpoise, H, used alone to counteract the\r\neffect of change of level. Fig. 5 shows a modification of this extremely\r\ningenious arrangement.--_Engineering_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINK BELTING.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From a paper read before the \"Technischen Verein\" of New\r\nYork, May 28, 1887.]\r\n\r\nBy CHAS. A. SCHIEREN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old saying that \"there is nothing new under the sun\" may well be\r\napplied to leather link belting. It is generally believed that these\r\nbelts are of recent invention, but that is an error. They are over\r\nthirty years old.\r\n\r\nMr. C.M. Roullier, of Paris, experimented that long ago with small\r\nleather links one and one-half inches long by three-quarters of an inch\r\nwide. These links had two small holes at equal distances apart, and were\r\njoined with iron bolts, which were riveted at the ends, thus making a\r\nperfectly flat surface, and in that way forming a belt entirely of\r\nleather links.\r\n\r\nMr. Roullier's idea was to economize; he therefore utilized the material\r\nleft over from the manufacture of flat belting. He perfected his belt\r\nand came to this country in 1862, when he patented the article here and\r\ntried to introduce it. At first it produced quite a sensation, and many\r\ntests were made, but it was soon found that Roullier's belts were not\r\nsuited to running our swift motion machinery, and they were therefore\r\nabandoned as impracticable.\r\n\r\nMr. Roullier then introduced his invention into England, where he met\r\nwith some success, as his belt was better suited to English slow motion\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nThese belts are now largely used in England, many good improvements have\r\nbeen made in them, and almost every belt maker in Great Britain\r\nmanufactures them.\r\n\r\nMr. Jabez Oldfield, of Glasgow, has the reputation of making the best\r\nand most reliable link belt in Great Britain. He has also the reputation\r\nof being the originator of these belts. This is, however, an error, the\r\ncredit of the invention belonging, as we have said, to Mr. Roullier.\r\n\r\nMr. Oldfield, nevertheless, has invented many useful machines for\r\ncutting and assorting the links. He has also introduced improved methods\r\nfor putting the links together.\r\n\r\nFor more than twenty years after Mr. Roullier's visit, nothing was done\r\nwith leather link belting in this country.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, however, Mr. N.W. Hall, of Newark, N.J., patented a link belt,\r\ncomposed of leather and steel links. His method was to place a steel\r\nlink after every third or fourth leather one, in order to strengthen the\r\nbelt. In practical use this belt was found to be very defective, because\r\nthe leather links soon stretched, and thus all the work had to be done\r\nby the steel links. The whole strain coming thus upon the steel links,\r\nthey in course of time cut through the bolts and thus broke the belt to\r\npieces. So this invention proved worthless.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 a Chicago belt company obtained a patent on another style of\r\nlink belt. In this belt all the little holes in the links were lined\r\nwith metal, similar to the holes in laced shoes. This produced an effect\r\nsimilar to that produced by Hall's patent. The metal lining of the holes\r\ncut the bolts into pieces by friction and thus ruined the belt.\r\nTherefore this patent proved a failure also.\r\n\r\nAfter all these failures it fell to our lot to improve these belts so\r\nthat they may now be worked successfully on our American fast running\r\nmachinery. During the past two years we have made and sold over five\r\nhundred leather link belts, which are all in actual use and doing\r\nexcellent service, as is proved by many testimonials which we have\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nOur success with these belts has been so surprising that we think we\r\nhave found, at last, the long looked for \"missing link,\" not in\r\n\"Darwinism,\" however, but in the belting line. We prophesy a great\r\nfuture for these belts in this country.\r\n\r\nHow have we attained such success? First: We found that Roullier made a\r\nmistake in using leather offal, as, in the links of an _iron chain_, if\r\none link is weak or defective, the whole chain is worthless, so in link\r\nbelts, if one or two links are weak or made of poor material, the whole\r\nbelt is affected by them. It is therefore of vital importance that only\r\nthe best and most solid leather be used in making the links; second, the\r\nleather must be made very pliable, but at the same time its toughness\r\nand tenacity must not be injured, or it will stretch and break.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 1.]\r\n\r\nThese things are of great importance, and are the principal reasons for\r\nthe failures of all former efforts. The leather which Roullier used was\r\nstiff, hard, and husky. He believed that the harder the link the greater\r\nits tensile strength, but upon actual test this was found to be a fatal\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nOur leather links are saturated with a mixture of tallow, neatsfoot oil,\r\netc. This makes them very pliable and increases their toughness, so that\r\nthey will stand a strain three times as great as a piece of hard rolled\r\nsole leather.\r\n\r\nIn manufacturing this belt, the joining together is important. The links\r\nmust be accurately assorted as to thickness, and the outer links\r\ncountersunk, to admit the bolt. Then the most valuable improvement of\r\nall is our \"American joint\" (see Fig. 1).\r\n\r\nBy close inspection you will observe that it is absolutely necessary to\r\nuse half length bolts for the width of wide leather link belts.\r\n\r\nExamine Figs. 2 and 3. In the latter you will notice one length of bolt\r\nplaced on a round faced pulley. That belt must either bend or break, and\r\nin any case it will not give satisfaction; but, on the other hand,\r\nexamine Fig. 2; here two half length bolts are used, and ingeniously\r\njoined in the center. It gives just pliability enough to lay the belt\r\nflat upon the pulley. We experimented for some time before perfecting\r\nthis important improvement.\r\n\r\nWe also took out four patents for different methods of joining, but\r\nabandoned them all and adopted the \"American joint\" system (Fig. 1) as\r\nthe most efficient, simple, and reliable. It gives the belt an unbroken\r\nflat surface and is far superior to anything so far introduced for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nWe have not stopped at _flat_ link belting, but have turned our\r\nattention to manufacturing round solid leather link belting, and believe\r\nthat we have almost attained perfection in that line. As the\r\nillustrations clearly show, there is quite a demand for inch and upward\r\nsolid round belting, and the difficulty always has been to join such a\r\nbelt together. All steel hooks, etc., do not seem to satisfy. This, our\r\nnew invention, is so simple that it hardly needs explanation. A belt of\r\nthis kind can be taken apart in a short time, and shortened or\r\nlengthened at pleasure.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. President and gentlemen, I shall be glad to answer any\r\nquestions in reference to these link belts, or give any further\r\nexplanation you may desire.\r\n\r\nQuestion.--Can these link belts be used on dynamos for electric lights?\r\n\r\nAnswer.--Yes. In England they are used almost exclusively on dynamos.\r\nHowever, they run only 700 revolutions per minute there, whereas our\r\nslowest dynamo runs 1,100.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nQuest.--Would you advise link belts for high rate of speed?\r\n\r\nAns.--No; they give better results on slow running machinery.\r\n\r\nQuest.--Have these belts any special advantage over flat leather\r\nbelting?\r\n\r\nAns.--Yes, decidedly. When belts are run half crossed, or what is termed\r\nquarter turn, it is very hard to make flat belts lie perfectly even on\r\nthe pulleys. These link belts, however, cover the entire face of the\r\npulley (see illustration), and therefore are superior for that purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nQuest.--Why do they give better results when run slow?\r\n\r\nAns.--Partly because of their great weight over ordinary belting, also\r\ntheir grip power is stronger when run slow. No belt is superior to them\r\nfor slow, hard working machinery.\r\n\r\nQuest.--Are they more expensive than ordinary flat belting?\r\n\r\nAns.--Not when compared to the work they can accomplish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nQuest.--Can they be run in wet places, such as mines, etc.?\r\n\r\nAns.--Yes; by waterproofing the leather, no cement being used as in flat\r\nbelts. The links can be made positively waterproof. We have furnished\r\npaper mills, tanneries and bleacheries, and other exposed places with\r\nwaterproof link belts, and all have been entirely satisfactory so far.\r\n\r\nQuest.--Can they be run on ordinary flat pulleys?\r\n\r\nAns.--Yes; our \"American joint\" link belt can be run on any straight or\r\nrounded pulley, whether made of iron, paper, or wood, and being all\r\nendless they run much smoother than other belting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGLISH HINGE JOINT:]\r\n\r\nQuest.--How are they made endless?\r\n\r\nAns.--By a very simple process (see illustration), and takes almost less\r\ntime than lacing a flat belt. All that is necessary is to take both ends\r\nand interlock the links, then pass the bolt through and rivet it, and\r\nwhen you wish to shorten the belt proceed likewise: File off the end of\r\nthe bolt and take out, or add rows of links at pleasure and rejoin it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4 is a complete round link belt.]\r\n\r\nQuest.--What is the relative strength of a link belt compared to flat\r\nbelting?\r\n\r\nAns.--Nothing definite has yet been ascertained. We are preparing a\r\ntable showing results, and so far we can report that they can stand\r\nabout twice the strain of double flat belts. A four inch link belt one\r\ninch thick is able to do the work of an eight inch flat double belt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5 is a side view.]\r\n\r\nQuest.--Explain the advantage of your American joint over the English\r\nhinge.\r\n\r\nAns.--The American joint gives a perfect unbroken surface of entire\r\nwidth of belt, whereas the English hinge joint makes two half widths,\r\nand whenever a sudden change of power occurs and the belt runs half way\r\noff the pulley, it will catch at the edge and tear everything to pieces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6 is an end view.]\r\n\r\nQuest.--Have you a table or schedule of their weight per square foot?\r\n\r\nAns.--Yes. The following is as near as we can estimate the weight of\r\nleather link belting per square foot:\r\n\r\n   1  inch thick, about 5  lb. per sq. ft.\r\n  7/8   \"    \"      \"   4½  \"   \"  \"\r\n  3/4   \"    \"      \"   4   \"   \"  \"\r\n  5/8   \"    \"      \"   3½  \"   \"  \"\r\n\r\nUpon motion a vote of thanks was passed, and the paper read ordered to\r\nbe printed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7 is a single link.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW PROCESS OF CASTING IRON AND OTHER METALS UPON LACE, EMBROIDERIES,\r\nFERN LEAVES, AND OTHER COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Abstract of a paper read before the Franklin Institute,\r\nApril, 1887.--_J.F.I._]\r\n\r\nBy A.E. OUTERBRIDGE, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art of making charcoal--if, indeed, so crude a process is worthy of\r\nbeing dignified by the name of an art--dates back to a remote antiquity,\r\nand has been practiced with but little change for hundreds of years. It\r\nis true that some improvements have been recently made, but these relate\r\nto the recovery of certain volatile by-products which were formerly\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nEvery one is familiar with the appearance and characteristics of\r\nordinary charcoal, yet I hope to show you this evening that we still\r\nhave something new to learn about its qualities and the unexpected\r\npractical uses to which it may be applied.\r\n\r\nWe commonly regard charcoal as a brittle, readily combustible substance,\r\nbut we have before us specimens in which these qualities are\r\nconspicuously absent. Here is a piece of carbonized cotton sheeting,\r\nwhich may be rolled or folded over without breaking, and, as you see,\r\nwhen placed in the flame of a Bunsen burner, the fibers may be heated\r\nwhite hot in the air, and when removed from the flame, the material\r\nshows no tendency to consume. Here, again, we have a piece of very fine\r\nlace, which has been similarly carbonized, and displays the same\r\nqualities of ductility and incombustibility.\r\n\r\nThese carbonized fabrics may be subjected to much more severe tests with\r\nimpunity; and when I tell you that they have been exposed to a bath of\r\nmolten iron without injury, you will readily admit that they possess\r\nsome qualities not ordinarily associated with charcoal. When removed\r\nfrom the mould in which they were placed after the iron casting had\r\ncooled, not a single fiber was consumed, but _upon the face of the\r\ncasting there was found a sharp and accurate reproduction of the design,\r\nthus forming a die_. This die may be used for a variety of purposes,\r\nsuch as embossing leather, stamping paper, sheet metal, etc., or for\r\nproducing ornamental surfaces upon such castings.\r\n\r\nSome of the carbonized fabrics displayed upon the table are almost as\r\ndelicate as cobwebs, and one would naturally suppose that when a great\r\nbody of molten metal is poured into a mould in which they are placed,\r\nthey would be torn to fragments and float to the surface even though\r\nthey were unconsumed, yet such is not the case. I have found in practice\r\nthat the most delicate fabrics may be subjected to this treatment\r\nwithout danger of destruction, and that no special care is needed either\r\nin preparing the mould or in pouring the metal.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of the megascope, the enlarged images of some of these\r\ncastings, showing the delicate tracery of the patterns, will now be\r\nprojected upon the screen, and you can all see how perfectly the design\r\nis reproduced.\r\n\r\nIn these experiments, the mould was made in \"green sand\" in the ordinary\r\nmanner, and the fabric laid smoothly upon one face, being cut slightly\r\nlarger than the mould, in order that it might project over the edge, so\r\nthat when the moulding flask was closed, the fabric was held in its\r\nproper position. As the molten metal flowed into the mould, it forced\r\nthe fabric firmly against the sand wall, and when the casting was\r\nremoved, the carbonized fabric was stripped off from its face without\r\ninjury. In this way several castings have been made from one carbonized\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nThese castings are as sharp as electrotypes, whether made of soft fluid\r\niron or of hard, quick-setting metal. This peculiarity is owing to the\r\naffinity between molten iron or steel and carbon. The molten metal tends\r\nto absorb the carbon as it flows over it, thus causing the fabric to hug\r\nthe metal closely. It is somewhat analogous to the effect of pouring\r\nmercury over zinc. You know that when mercury is poured upon a board, it\r\nruns in a globular form, it does not \"wet\" the board, so to speak; but\r\nwhen poured upon a plate of clean zinc, it flows like water and wets\r\nevery portion of the zinc, or, as we say, it amalgamates with the zinc.\r\nSo when molten iron is poured into an ordinary sand mould, which has\r\nbeen faced with this refractorily carbonized fabric, it wets every\r\nportion of it, tending to absorb the carbon, and doubtless would do so\r\nif it remained fluid long enough, but as the metal cools almost\r\nimmediately, there is no appreciable destruction of the fibers.\r\n\r\nThe casting which I shall now exhibit represents a very interesting and\r\nnovel experiment. In this case, the piece of lace, having open meshes a\r\nlittle larger than a pin's head, instead of being laid upon one face of\r\nthe mould, was suspended in it in such a way as to divide it into two\r\nequal parts. Two gates or runners were provided, leading from the\r\n\"sinking head\" to the bottom of the mould, one on each side of the lace\r\npartition. The molten iron was poured into the sinking head, and flowing\r\nequally through both runners, filled the mould to a common level. The\r\nlace, which was held in position by having its edges embedded in the\r\nwalls of the mould, remained intact. When the casting was cold, it was\r\nthrown upon the floor of the foundry and separated into two parts, while\r\nthe lace fell out uninjured, and the pattern was found to be reproduced\r\nupon each face of the casting.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises, Why did not the iron run through the\r\nholes and join together? The answer may be found in the fact that the\r\nthin film of oxide of iron, or \"skin,\" as it is popularly called, which\r\nalways forms on the surface of molten iron, was caught in these fine\r\nmeshes, and thus prevented the molten metal from joining through the\r\nholes. I have repeated the experiment a number of times, and find that\r\nthe meshes must be quite small (not over one fiftieth of an inch),\r\notherwise the metal will reunite.\r\n\r\nI think that this observation explains the cause of many obscure flaws\r\nfound in castings, sometimes causing them to break when subjected to\r\nquite moderate strains. We frequently find little \"cold shot,\" or\r\nmetallic globules, embedded in cast iron or steel, impairing the\r\nstrength of the metal, and it has long been asked, \"What is the cause of\r\nthis defect?\" The pellicles have been carefully analyzed, under the\r\nsupposition that they might be alloys of iron and nickel, or some other\r\nrefractory metal, but the analysis has failed to substantiate this\r\ntheory. Is it not probable that in the process of casting, little drops\r\nof molten metal are sometimes splashed out of the stream, which\r\nimmediately solidify and become coated with a skin of oxide, then\r\nfalling back into the stream of rapidly cooling metal, they do not\r\nremelt, neither do they weld or amalgamate with the mass, owing to this\r\nprotective coating, thus forming dangerous flaws in the casting?\r\n\r\nThe process of carbonizing the delicate fabrics, leaves, grasses, etc.,\r\nis as follows: The objects are placed in a cast iron box, the bottom of\r\nwhich is covered with a layer of powdered charcoal or other form of\r\ncarbon, then another layer of carbon dust is sprinkled over them, and\r\nthe box is covered with a close fitting lid. The box is next heated\r\ngradually in an oven, to drive off moisture, and the temperature slowly\r\nraised until the escape of blue smoke from under the lid ceases. The\r\nheat is then increased until the box becomes white hot. It is kept in\r\nthis glowing condition for at least two hours. It is then removed from\r\nthe fire, allowed to cool, and the contents are tested in a gas flame.\r\nIf they have been thoroughly carbonized, they will not glow when removed\r\nfrom the flame, and the fibers may even be heated white hot before\r\nconsuming.\r\n\r\nOf course, the method employed to carbonize the materials is suspectible\r\nof variation, but the scientific principles involved are unchangeable,\r\nviz.:\r\n\r\n(1) Partial exclusion of air and substitution therefor of a carbon\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n(2) Slow heating to drive off moisture and volatile elements.\r\n\r\n(3) Intense and prolonged heating of the partly charred objects to\r\neliminate remaining foreign elements, and to change the carbon from the\r\ncombustible form of ordinary charcoal to a highly refractory condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Fig. 1 is photographed from a white iron casting made upon\r\ncarbonized coarse lace; the lower portion of the plate shows the lace\r\nembedded in the iron.

Macpherson, of\r\nKirkcaldy, the chairman, said:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REGENERATIVE SYSTEM OF RETORT FIRINGS.\r\n\r\nFor me to attempt, with the time at my disposal, to do full justice to\r\nmany important points which have cropped up since our last meeting, and\r\nwhich will, no doubt, have been engaging your individual attention,\r\nwould be impossible. But I think there can be no doubt that, although at\r\nour last meeting we had a very full and interesting discussion on the\r\ndifferent systems of regenerative retort settings, still we might very\r\nprofitably spend a little time to-day in hearing the experience of those\r\nwho have had some of the systems introduced into their works since then,\r\nor who may have gained further experience with the system they were then\r\nworking, or have introduced improvements or modifications thereon.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of inducing a discussion on this subject, I will give\r\nyou the result of the working of the bench of retorts which I erected\r\nthree years ago on the Siemens system. As I stated last year, my\r\nexperience up to that time had not been altogether a happy one, but one\r\nof sunshine and cloud alternately. I am glad to be able to say, however,\r\nthat since then I have had nothing but the utmost satisfaction in the\r\nworking of the regenerative settings. The chief difficulties I have\r\nbefore experienced were of a mixed nature--choked ascension pipes,\r\nentailing considerable loss of gas; the choking of the orifices from\r\nwhich the secondary heated air issued to join the producer gas; and the\r\neating away, in a \"scooped-out\" sort of fashion, of the brick lining of\r\nthe producers at the points where the primary air entered. These, I am\r\npleased to be able to say, I am now completely clear of; and this has\r\nhad the effect of converting what was before a considerable source of\r\nannoyance and anxiety into as perfect a working bench of retorts as any\r\none could desire.\r\n\r\nThe results I have obtained have caused me much surprise, being far in\r\nexcess of anything I ever anticipated; and the saving effected will\r\nmaterially assist in compensating for the greatly reduced value of\r\nresiduals. I may state that I have used 30 per cent. of fuel on an\r\naverage, saved from 25 to 30 per cent. on stokers' wages, and increased\r\nmy production of gas per ton of coal; while the regularity of the heats\r\nwas a pleasure to look upon.\r\n\r\nAs showing what I have been able to accomplish, I will give you a few\r\ndetails. I was able regularly to produce 10,000 cubic feet of gas per\r\nmouthpiece in 24 hours--the size of my retorts being 18 by 13 inches by\r\n9 feet long, inside measure; and on a sudden dullness coming on, with an\r\nincrease of first class cannel I produced from 33 retorts 357,000 cubic\r\nfeet, or at the rate of 11,500 feet per mouthpiece in 24 hours. With 32\r\nretorts I made as much gas as would have required 42 retorts to produce\r\non the old system. But I know that even this can be excelled; and I am\r\naware that there are works where, by the introduction of retorts\r\nmeasuring 21 by 15 inches, instead of 18 by 13 inches--and which, I may\r\nsay, can be put quite easily into the same arch--a production of 12,000\r\ncubic feet per mouthpiece can be obtained. This will, of course, still\r\nfurther reduce the cost of production.\r\n\r\nWith such an experience, gentlemen, I think it is almost needless for me\r\nto add that I am a strong advocate of the regenerative system. I have\r\noften heard it asked, \"But can the system be profitably adapted to small\r\nworks?\" In answer to this, I will say I have proved that it can. During\r\nlast summer the manager of a small gas works in my neighborhood called\r\non me regarding the working of this system, and expressed a desire, if\r\nit was at all possible to adapt it to his present settings without much\r\nexpense, to try it. I must say I admired his progressive spirit and\r\npluck; and, after a somewhat lengthy conversation with him, during which\r\nI gathered the full details of his working and his requirements, I\r\ndetermined to encourage him in his desire to prove if it could be\r\nsuccessfully applied to a works of the size mentioned. The present\r\nsetting consisted of three [semicircle] retorts in one arch; and one of\r\nhis stipulations to me was: \"You must so contrive the setting that if it\r\nshould prove a failure I can reconvert it into the old system in a few\r\nhours.\" I at once saw that the stipulation was reasonable, or he might\r\nbe caught in a fix in midwinter. But, with true \"Scotch caution\" and\r\nforethought, he was, while anxious to experiment, determined not to be\r\n\"caught napping.\" After some consideration, I prepared a sketch for him\r\nof how I thought it could be done, and at the same time comply with his\r\nstipulation; and having received full explanations, he set about it, and\r\nhas had it working now for something like six months. His experience has\r\nbeen somewhat similar to that of most of those who have gone in for the\r\nnew system. It did not answer very well at first. But after a little\r\nmanipulation and experience in the proper working and management, it is\r\nnow acting in first rate style, and is saving fuel, with better and more\r\nregular heats; and this although it is not constructed in such a way as\r\nto yield the best possible results, owing to the before mentioned\r\nstipulation having to be considered and allowed for in construction.\r\n\r\nIn answer to an inquiry I made the other day, the gentleman referred to\r\ninformed me that he has now had this setting in operation for six\r\nmonths. He has three retorts, 14 by 16 inches, and 8 feet long, in an\r\noven carbonizing 2 cwt. of coal every four hours; the heats are higher\r\nand more regular; and the retorts easier kept clear of carbon. The coke\r\ndrawn from the top retort is sufficient for fuel. My oven would hold\r\nfour retorts; and the same fuel would heat this number just as well as\r\nthe three. I used only the coke from Cowdenheath parrot coal for this\r\nsetting; but had to mix it with Burghlee coke for the old system of\r\nsetting.\r\n\r\nNo doubt most of you will have noticed the satisfactory results obtained\r\nby Mr. Hack, of the Saltley Gas Works, Birmingham, and by Mr. McMinn, of\r\nKensal Green, with the furnaces employed by them for gaseous firing\r\nwithout recuperation, whereby they are enabled to save fuel and\r\ncarbonize more coal per mouthpiece than with the old system. Still they\r\nadmit that the saving by this setting is only in fuel, with increased\r\nproduction, but without any economy of labor--one of the points in favor\r\nof regenerative setting being a saving of at least 25 per cent. in the\r\nlatter respect. Even where regenerative settings cannot be had, I think\r\nthe system of using gaseous fuel is well worthy the attention of\r\nmanagers; the expense of altering the existing settings to this method\r\nbeing very small.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS IN GAS PURIFICATION.\r\n\r\nI must now, however, pass on to some other topics. After the proper\r\nproduction of the gas, we have still the processes of purification to\r\nconsider, and how this operation can best be effected at the smallest\r\ncost, combined with efficiency and the least possible annoyance to\r\nresidents in the immediate vicinity of gas works. I think all gas\r\nengineers are agreed that in ammoniacal liquor we have a useful and\r\npowerful purifying agent, although each one may have his own particular\r\nidea of how this can be most efficiently applied--some advocating\r\nscrubbers, others washers. But these are things which each one must\r\ndetermine for himself. But in whatever way it is applied, we know that\r\nit can be profitably used for this purpose; and I am not without hope\r\nthat it may soon be found possible to remove nearly all the impurities\r\nby this means.\r\n\r\nAt present, however, this is not so. And consequently we have a variety\r\nof other methods employed for the complete removal of the impurities.\r\nBut, by whatever means it is effected, it is unquestionably the duty of\r\nthe gas engineer to send out to the public an article from which the\r\nwhole of the impurities have been removed.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, no doubt, our chief purifying material is lime, although I\r\nknow that several of our friends have for some time been using oxide of\r\niron, and perhaps they will favor us with their experience and a\r\nstatement of the relative cost of lime and oxide. I am not aware that\r\neither the Hawkins method or the Cooper coal liming process has yet\r\nreceived a trial from any Scotch gas engineer.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNERS AND REGENERATIVE LAMPS.\r\n\r\nBut even after we have been able to produce and send out gas of the\r\ngreatest purity, our troubles are frequently only beginning, as, very\r\noften, consumers do not use, but simply waste and destroy the gas by bad\r\nburners and fittings. Nothing, however, will convince them that they are\r\nin any way to blame for the light being poor. I am certainly of opinion\r\nthat gas companies would do the public a service in supplying them with\r\nsuitable burners for the quality of gas that is being sent out for\r\nconsumption. I have myself for some years adopted this policy, and\r\nalmost invariably find that complaints cease and consumers are pleased\r\nwith the results.\r\n\r\nWe have now also so large a number of really good regenerative lamps\r\nwhich give excellent results, and can be made in a great variety of very\r\nneat and ornamental designs, that we ought to endeavor to the utmost of\r\nour power to introduce them to the public, and, if possible, induce them\r\nto use them not only in halls and similar places, but in their dwelling\r\nhouses, as with these lamps a most thorough and efficient system of\r\nventilation can be carried out, by which the heat that is so much\r\ncomplained of in gas-lighted apartments is reduced to a minimum, and the\r\natmosphere of such apartments is rendered healthy and agreeable.\r\n\r\nWith such improved lamps at our command, I think we have nothing to fear\r\nfrom the competition of the electric light, which during the past year\r\nhas not made any very startling advance--generally attributed by\r\nelectricians to the restrictive legislation under which they have been\r\nplaced. Let us hope this is now about to be removed. I am sure we all\r\nrejoice that such is the case, as all we want is a \"fair field and no\r\nfavor.\" We can with confidence await the result.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WELSBACH GAS LIGHT.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, however, while electricity for lighting purposes has,\r\nto say the least, not made any startling advances, we have, besides the\r\nregenerative lamps before mentioned, the new Welsbach light, which is\r\nexhibited before you to-day, by the kindness of Dr. Wallace; and if the\r\nresults said to be obtained by it are at all what they are represented\r\nto be, we certainly have a new departure in gas lighting of no mean\r\norder. Dr. Wallace--a gentleman who is well known to us as one well\r\nqualified to test its merits--has found that the Welsbach burner\r\nproduces a light equal to more than 9 candles per cubic foot of gas of\r\n25 candle power, thus nearly doubling the amount of light compared with\r\ngas consumed in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nThe construction and manufacture of the burner I have seen described in\r\nthese terms: Chemists have been diligently working for many years on the\r\nproblem of how to convert into light the highly condensed heat of the\r\nBunsen burner; and a Vienna chemist now claims to have solved it.\r\n\r\nThe first condition of the problem was to find a medium on which the\r\nheat could be perfectly concentrated and raised to illuminating power.\r\nMany experiments have been made with platinum in a Bunsen flame, and a\r\nbrilliant enough light has been produced, but at a cost altogether\r\noutside commercial use. The Vienna chemist, Dr. Welsbach, has discovered\r\na composition which is as good a non-conductor--that is to say\r\nconcentrator--of heat as platinum, is much more durable, and a great\r\ndeal cheaper. The base of it is a peculiar clay, found in Ceylon, which\r\ncombines the indestructibility of asbestos with the non-conducting\r\nproperty of platinum; and having found the incandescent medium, he has\r\nnext adapted it to the Bunsen burner.\r\n\r\nIn this arrangement there is the simplicity of genius. He gets a fine\r\ncotton fabric woven into the shape of a cylinder, with a tapering point.\r\nIn its first stage it is about 2 inches in diameter; and after being\r\ncoated with the composition, it is subjected to a strong heat. This has\r\ntwo effects--first, the cotton fiber is completely burned out, while the\r\ncomposition retains the shape of the woven surface on which it was\r\nmoulded. Then the cylinder contracts and solidifies until it becomes\r\nabout the size of the forefinger of a glove. Dr. Welsbach calls this his\r\n\"mantle;\" and by a simple arrangement he fits it on a Bunsen burner, and\r\nplaces an ordinary lamp chimney over it. When the flame is applied, the\r\n\"mantle\" becomes incandescent, and gives out a brilliant yellow light,\r\nwhich, it may be said without exaggeration, will compare favorably with\r\nany electric light yet put on the market.\r\n\r\nFor decorative effect a pretty frosted globe is used; and by varying the\r\nglobe a pure white or a pure yellow may be obtained. It is also added\r\nthat there is no act of Parliament required for it, nor even a\r\nprovisional order of the Board of Trade. No streets have to be broken up\r\nin order to lay down pipes; and no wires have to be hung across the\r\nroofs of protesting householders.\r\n\r\nThe whole apparatus can be got ready to fit on an ordinary gas bracket;\r\nand two or three spare frames with \"mantles\" can be kept in the house in\r\ncase of accident. Whoever sees the Welsbach incandescent light in\r\noperation will readily admit that it is the \"coming light.\" It has\r\nbeauty, brilliancy, purity, and economy all on its side.\r\n\r\nLet us hope (added the chairman) this description is not overdrawn; but\r\nof this you will later on have an opportunity of judging for yourselves.\r\nNo doubt the general or even partial adoption of this light would have a\r\ntendency to reduce the consumption of gas, as a smaller quantity would\r\nbe required to produce the same amount of illumination. Nevertheless,\r\ngas engineers will hail it with approval if it in any way tends to\r\npopularize the use of gas, and helps to increase the comfort and improve\r\nthe sanitation of our houses, churches, halls, etc. Moreover, gas is\r\ncontinually being adopted for fresh purposes; and we can confidently\r\nlook forward to an almost unlimited field in the rapid and ever\r\nincreasing use of gas as a fuel and for cooking purposes, as well as for\r\nmotive power. The new and really excellent gas engines now being brought\r\ninto the market will, no doubt, create a healthy rivalry, and tend to\r\ncheapen these useful machines, and so bring them within the reach of\r\nmany persons who have hitherto been prevented from employing them by\r\ntheir considerable first cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARAFFIN AS A RIVAL OF COAL GAS.\r\n\r\nBut while the day has gone by when any one of us fears the electric\r\nlight as a possible rival, we are not insensible to the fact that\r\nparaffin oil, from its present low-price, is a rival which we cannot\r\nafford to despise. And more especially is this the case in many of the\r\nsmaller towns and villages, where the charge for gas is of necessity\r\nhigher than in the larger towns.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, with oil there is not the same cleanliness as with gas; while\r\nthere is also more trouble, attention, and considerable danger attending\r\nits use. Still, in these \"hard times,\" most people are inclined to adopt\r\nthe cheapest article, even at the cost of these drawbacks, so as to make\r\ntheir money go as far as possible.\r\n\r\nBut not only as an illuminant is it being brought into direct\r\ncompetition with gas, but also as a fuel and for cooking purposes, as\r\nwell as for motive power. And I am inclined to think that the sooner we\r\nset about trying to solve the problem of how to meet this new\r\ncompetitor, the better.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL IN GAS MAKING.\r\n\r\nA new departure has also recently taken place in the adoption of oil for\r\ngas making purposes. This, of course, is more fraught with danger to the\r\ncoal master than to gas companies, inasmuch as, should this prove to be\r\na more economical raw material from which to produce illuminating gas\r\nthan coal, our present coal gas works could be easily remodeled and\r\nturned into oil gas works. This process has recently been introduced\r\ninto a village in Fifeshire. And I have made it a point to visit and\r\ninspect the works, which have been converted into an oil gas works, so\r\nthat I might be able to lay a few particulars before you. The process,\r\nhowever, has not been in operation long enough to enable me to give you\r\nmuch information on the subject, especially in the way of details of\r\ncost, working expenses, or permanency of the gas under varying and low\r\ntemperatures. The patentees claim that they can produce 100 cubic feet\r\nof 60 candle gas from a gallon of oil, or at a cost of 3s. 11d. per\r\n1,000 cubic feet for oil, fuel, and labor; no more expense being\r\nincurred, as the gas does not require purification.\r\n\r\nAt Colinsburgh (the village alluded to), I was informed that the man\r\nsent by the patentees could produce 100 cubic feet of gas per gallon of\r\noil; but they had no means of testing the illuminating power. The gas\r\ncompany's own servant, however, only produced 80 cubic feet per gallon,\r\nwhich they attributed to his want of experience in knowing the proper\r\nheat at which to work the retorts. Whether or not this was so I cannot\r\ntell; but of this I am certain, that the statement made that the gas\r\ndoes not require purification will not bear investigation. When I tested\r\nit for sulphureted hydrogen and for ammonia, both were indicated in such\r\nan unmistakable manner as none of us would care to see in our coal gas\r\nas sent out to the consumer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICES OF RESIDUAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nWhat is of far more real consequence to us than the possible change from\r\ncoal gas to oil gas, however, as long as we remain manufacturers of the\r\nformer, is the value of our residual products, which has suffered so\r\ngreat and sudden a decline in value, for which various remedies have\r\nbeen proposed, though none of them, I regret to say, have as yet\r\nrestored anything like the former value. A statement of the highest\r\nprices realized for coal tar products, and a comparison with those\r\nobtained on the 30th of March last year and at the same time this year,\r\nmay not be uninteresting:\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                     | Highest      | Price on      | Price on      |\r\n  |                     | Price        | March 30,     | March 30,     |\r\n  |                     |              | 1886          | 1887          |\r\n  |                     |--------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n  |                     |   per gal.   |    per gal.   | per gal.      |\r\n  |                     |----+----+----+---+-----------+---------------+\r\n  |                     | £  | s. | d. | £  | s. |  d. | £  | s. | d.  |\r\n  |                     |----+----+----+----+----+-----+----+----+-----+\r\n  |Crude naphtha        |  0 |  4 |  0 |  0 | 0  |  4½ |  0 |  0 |  8½ |\r\n  |Benzol (90 per cent.)|  0 | 15 |  0 |  0 | 1  |  4  |  0 |  2 |  6  |\r\n  |Solvent naphtha      |  0 |  2 |  6 |  0 | 1  |  0  |  0 |  1 |  2  |\r\n  |Burning naphtha      |  0 |  1 |  7 |  0 | 0  | 10½ |  0 |  0 | 10  |\r\n  |Creosote oil         |  0 |  0 |  3 |  0 | 0  |  0¾ |  0 |  0 |  1  |\r\n  |                     |              |               |               |\r\n  |                     |   per ton.   |     per ton.  |    per ton.   |\r\n  |                     |----+----+----+----+----+-----+----+----+-----+\r\n  |                     | £  | s. | d. | £  | s. |  d. | £  | s. | d.  |\r\n  |                     |----+----+----+----+----+-----+----+----+-----+\r\n  |Pitch                |  1 | 14 |  0 |  0 | 15 |   0 |  0 | 12 |  6  |\r\n  |Sulphate of ammonia  | 21 |  5 |  0 | 13 | 10 |   0 | 11 | 10 |  0  |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThis shows a great fall in value from highest to lowest, which seems to\r\nhave been touched last year, except in the case of pitch and sulphate of\r\nammonia, both of which have marked a considerable decline, even since\r\nlast year, but it is pleasing to note that the others have shown at\r\nleast some slight improvement--crude naphtha and benzol having during\r\nthe year risen nearly one hundred per cent. in value. Let us hope that\r\nthis is the precursor of a general rise in value from which we shall all\r\nprofit. For the purpose of bringing about this much desired end, I\r\nunderstand that some of the gentlemen present to-day have been burning\r\ntheir tar in the retort furnaces, and as it will be interesting to know\r\nwhat success they have attained, I hope some of them will favor us with\r\ntheir experience on this subject.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let me express the hope that the time is not far distant\r\nwhen the general trade of the country will attain to its wonted\r\nprosperity, by which every branch of industry will benefit--ours among\r\nthe number; and that the hard times we have experienced, now for a\r\nconsiderable number of years, may not again return.\r\n\r\nDiscussion next took place regarding the Welsbach incandescence gas\r\nlight, which was opened by Mr. McGrilchrist, who remarked on the very\r\nfragile and tender nature of the \"mantle,\" and expressed a hope that in\r\nthis direction improvement might be looked for. It was certainly a\r\nbeautiful light, and as to its consumption, he stated that the lamp then\r\nshown to the meeting was only burning two cubic feet of gas per hour. [A\r\nvoice: Two and two-tenths.] He felt satisfied that it would enable the\r\nmanufacturers of gas to compete with paraffin oil, so that with Glasgow\r\ngas they could have such a light as they saw at the rate of 4d. for\r\nabout fifty hours.\r\n\r\nMr. W. Key (Tradeston Gas Works) made a statement giving the results of\r\ninquiries he had made at St. Enoch Station Hotel, where the light has\r\nfor some time been on exhibition. From the answers given to his\r\ninquiries he spoke rather disparagingly of the lamp, but chiefly on\r\naccount of the expense involved in renewing the \"mantles\" and the glass\r\nchimneys. He admitted, however, that the lamps which he had seen were\r\nplaced very unfavorably, being exposed to the action of somewhat violent\r\ndraughts, and he subsequently remarked that the lamp was of such a\r\nnature as to effect the complete combustion of the carbon contained in\r\nthe gas. The burner must, therefore, be regarded as a great boon--as\r\n_the_ burner, in short.\r\n\r\nMr. D.M. Nelson (Glasgow) gave his experience gained in connection with\r\nthe light, remarking that one of the great drawbacks to it was the very\r\ngreat rarity of the mineral from which the zirconium was obtained. So\r\nscarce was it that it would become dearer than platinum and more\r\nvaluable than gold if the lamp came into general use. The light which\r\nthe lamp gave out, though it possessed intensity, was deficient in\r\ndiffusibility as compared with that given out from ordinary flat flame\r\ngas burners, and this was another objection to it. He argued at some\r\nlength against the financial aspects of the scheme which was being\r\npromoted to buy up the Welsbach patents, and to introduce the lamp into\r\nthis country. His advice to his friends was not to have anything to do\r\nwith the Welsbach company, and, as investors, to be very careful in\r\naccepting all the statements made about the light, which he predicted\r\nwould not be a financial success.\r\n\r\nMr. McCrae was strongly opposed to any discussion being raised in regard\r\nto the question being considered in its financial aspects. They, as gas\r\nengineers, did not require to trouble themselves with the doings of\r\ninvestors. He regarded the Welsbach burner as an improved appliance for\r\nconsuming gas. It was an invention which was quite new to him, and as he\r\nwas not in possession of any facts which would enable him to condemn it,\r\nhe thought they ought, at least, to give it a fair trial. Referring to\r\nthe fragile nature of the \"mantle,\" he remarked that there were minds at\r\nwork aiming at giving a purer and more brilliant light from gas, and so\r\nfar he was of opinion that the light before them was a success. His\r\nopinion as to the diffusibility of the light emitted from the burner\r\ndiffered from that of Mr. Nelson, as he considered the light possessed\r\nthat quality in a high degree. He had no doubt that the minds already at\r\nwork on the incandescent light would seek out means for improving the\r\nburner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo varnish chromos, take equal quantities of linseed oil and oil of\r\nturpentine; thicken by exposure to the sun and air until it becomes\r\nresinous and half evaporated; then add a portion of melted beeswax.\r\nVarnishing pictures should always be performed in fair weather, and out\r\nof any current of cold or damp air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW BRITISH COINAGE AND JUBILEE MEDAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn important addition will be made to the coins now in circulation by\r\nthe issue of the double florin, the design of which is shown in one of\r\nour engravings. The reverse is composed of crowned shields, bearing the\r\narms of the United Kingdom arranged in the form of a cross between\r\nscepters, a device which was first adopted for coins of Charles II. It\r\nwas designed by Thomas Simon, the greatest of all English engravers, and\r\nit remains to be seen whether this handsome coin will be generally\r\npopular. The reverse of the florin will for the future bear the same\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year her majesty was pleased to signify her pleasure\r\nthat a portrait medallion, by Mr. J.E. Boehm, R.A., modeled from life,\r\nshould be substituted for the effigy which the coins have hitherto\r\nborne. In the new effigy, her majesty appears crowned and veiled, with\r\nthe ribbon and star of the garter and the Victoria and Albert order. The\r\nlegend \"Victoria Dei Gratia Britanniarum Regina, Fidei Defensor\" is\r\nvariously arranged on the different coins, according to the exigencies\r\nof the design.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity has at the same time been taken, with her majesty's\r\napproval, for making certain alterations in the designs for the reverses\r\nof some of the coins by abandoning those which did not appear to possess\r\nsufficient artistic merit to warrant their retention. The reverse of the\r\nsovereign will still bear the design of St. George and the Dragon, by\r\nPistrucci, first adopted for the sovereigns of George IV., and the\r\nreverses of the half-sovereign and threepence remain unchanged, except\r\nthat the crown has been assimilated to that used for the new effigy. The\r\nSt. George and the Dragon design will be resumed for the five-pound\r\npiece, the double sovereign, and the crown, this design having been\r\nadopted for these pieces when originally struck. The half-crown will\r\nbear the same reverse as that coin bore when first issued, a design of\r\nconsiderable merit, by Merlin. During the last half century public taste\r\nappears to have been satisfied, both in this country and abroad, with\r\nsome such insignificant design as a wreath surrounding words or figures\r\nindicating the value of the coin; and the shilling and sixpence have,\r\nduring the present reign, been examples of this treatment. They will in\r\nfuture, like the half-crown, bear the royal arms, crowned, and\r\nsurrounded by the garter.\r\n\r\nThe queen was further pleased to command that the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof her majesty's accession should be commemorated by the issue of a\r\nmedal. The effigy for this medal, which is also from a medallion by Mr.\r\nBoehm, has a somewhat more ornate veil than that on the coin; and on the\r\nbust, in addition to the Victoria and Albert order, is shown the badge\r\nof the imperial order of the crown of India. The reverse is a beautiful\r\nwork by Sir Frederic Leighton, President of the Royal Academy, of which\r\nthe following is a description: \"In the center a figure representing the\r\nBritish empire sits enthroned, resting one hand on the sword of justice,\r\nand holding in the other the symbol of victorious rule. A lion is seen\r\non each side of the throne. At the feet of the seated figure lies\r\nMercury, the God of Commerce, the mainstay of our imperial strength,\r\nholding up in one hand a cup heaped with gold. Opposite to him sits the\r\nGenius of Electricity and Steam. Below, again, five shields, banded\r\ntogether, bear the names of the five parts of the globe, Europe, Asia,\r\nAfrica, America, and Australasia, over which the empire extends. On each\r\nside of the figure of Empire stand the personified elements of its\r\ngreatness--on the right (of the spectator), Industry and Agriculture; on\r\nthe left, Science, Letters, and Art. Above, the occasion of the\r\ncelebration commemorated is expressed by two winged figures representing\r\nthe year 1887 (the advancing figure) and the year 1837 (with averted\r\nhead), holding each a wreath. Where these wreaths interlock, the letters\r\nV.R.I. appear, and, over all, the words 'In Commemoration.'\"\r\n\r\nThe issue of both the new coins and the medal began on June 21, the day\r\nappointed for the celebration of her majesty's jubilee.--_Illustrated\r\nLondon News_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW BRITISH COINAGE AND JUBILEE MEDAL.\r\n\r\n1.

ROGER SMITH, F.R.I.B.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nTimber, stone, earth, are the three materials most used by the builder\r\nin all parts of the world. Where timber is very plentiful, as in Norway\r\nor Switzerland, it is freely used, even though other materials are\r\nobtainable, and seems to be preferred, notwithstanding the risk of fire\r\nwhich attends its use. Where timber is scarce, and stone can be had,\r\nhouses are built of stone. Where there is no timber and no stone, they\r\nare built of earth--sometimes in its natural state, sometimes made into\r\nbricks and sun-dried, but more often made into bricks and burned.\r\n\r\nLondon is one of the places that occupies a spot which has long ceased\r\nto yield timber, and yields no stone, so we fall back on earth--burnt\r\ninto the form of bricks. Brick was employed in remote antiquity. The\r\nEgyptians, who were great and skillful builders, used it sometimes; and\r\nas we know from the book of Exodus, they employed the forced labor of\r\nthe captives or tributaries whom they had in their power in the hard\r\ntask of brick making; and some of their brick-built granaries and stores\r\nhave been recently discovered near the site of the battle of\r\nTel-el-Kebir.\r\n\r\nThe Assyrians and Babylonians made almost exclusive use of brickwork in\r\nerecting the vast piles of buildings the shapeless ruins of which mark\r\nthe site of ancient Nineveh and of the cities of the valley of the\r\nEuphrates. Their bricks, it is believed, were entirely sun-dried, not\r\nburnt to fuse or vitrify them as ours are, and they have consequently\r\ncrumbled into mere mounds. The Assyrians also used fine clay tablets,\r\nbaked in the fire--in fact, a kind of terra cotta--for the purpose of\r\nrecords, covering these tablets with beautifully executed inscriptions,\r\nmade with a pointed instrument while the clay was soft, and rendered\r\npermanent by burning. We don't know much about Greek brickwork; but it\r\nis probable that very little brick, if any, was made or used in any part\r\nof Greece, as stone, marble, and timber abound there; but the Romans\r\nmade bricks everywhere, and used them constantly. They were fond of\r\nmixing two or more materials together, as for example building walls in\r\nconcrete and inserting brickwork at intervals in horizontal layers to\r\nact as courses of bond. They also erected buildings of which the walls\r\nwere wholly of brick. They turned arches of wide span in brickwork; and\r\nthey frequently laid in their walls at regular distances apart courses\r\nof brick on edge and courses of sloping bricks, to which antiquaries\r\nhave given the name of herring-bone work.\r\n\r\nThe Roman bricks are interesting as records, for it was customary to\r\nemploy the soldiers on brick making, and to stamp the bricks with names\r\nand dates; and thus the Roman bricks found in this country give us some\r\ninformation as to the military commanders and legions occupying\r\ndifferent parts of England at different periods. Flue bricks, for the\r\npassage of smoke under floors and in other situations, are sometimes\r\nfound. The Roman brick was often flat and large--in fact, more like our\r\ncommon paving tiles, known as foot tiles, only of larger size than like\r\nthe bricks that we use. They vary, however, in size, shape, and\r\nthickness. Not a few of them are triangular in shape, and these are\r\nmostly employed as a sort of facing to concrete work, the point of the\r\ntriangle being embedded in the concrete and the broad base appearing\r\noutside. After the Roman time, brick making seems to have almost ceased\r\nin England for many centuries.\r\n\r\nIt is true we find remains of a certain number of massive brick\r\nbuildings erected not long after the Norman conquest; but on examination\r\nit turns out that these were put up at places where there had been a\r\nRoman town, and were built of Roman bricks obtained by pulling down\r\nprevious buildings. The oldest parts of St. Albans Abbey and portions of\r\nthe old Norman buildings at Colchester are examples of this sort.\r\nApparently, timber was used in this country almost exclusively for\r\nhumble buildings down to the 16th century. This is not surprising,\r\nconsidering how well wooded England was; but stone served during the\r\nsame period for important buildings almost to the exclusion of brick.\r\nThis is more remarkable, as we find stone churches and the ruins of\r\nstone castles in not a few spots remote from stone quarries, and to\r\nwhich the stone must have been laboriously conveyed at a time when roads\r\nwere very bad and wheel carts were scarce.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of the Tudors, say the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the\r\nmaking of bricks was resumed in England, and many dwelling houses and\r\nsome few churches were built of good brickwork in that and succeeding\r\nreigns. We find in such buildings as Hampton Court Palace, St. James'\r\nPalace, and Chelsea Hospital examples of the use of brickwork in\r\nimportant buildings near London at later dates. The fire of London, in\r\n1666, gave a sudden check to the use of timber in house building in the\r\nmetropolis. Previous to that date the majority of houses had been of a\r\nsort the most ornamental examples of which were copied in \"Old London\"\r\nat the Colonial Exhibition. The rebuilding after the fire was largely in\r\nbrick; and in the suburbs, in the latter part of the 17th and the 18th\r\ncenturies, many dignified square brick mansions, with bold, overhanging\r\neaves and high roofs and carved ornaments, entered through a pair of\r\nflorid wrought iron high gates, were built, some few of which still\r\nlinger in Hampstead and other suburbs. The war time at the beginning of\r\nthis century was a trying time for builders, with its high prices and\r\nheavy taxes, and some of the good-looking brick buildings of that day\r\nturn out to have been very badly built when they are pulled about for\r\nalterations. With the rapid, wonderful increase in population and wealth\r\nin this metropolis during the last 50 years a vast consumption of bricks\r\nhas taken place, and a year or two back it was reported by the\r\ncommissioners of police that the extensions of London equaled in a year\r\n70 miles of new house property, practically all of brick. Brick were\r\nheavily taxed in the war time which I have referred to, and the tax was\r\nlevied before burning.\r\n\r\nThere was a maximum size for the raw brick, which it was supposed served\r\nto keep bricks uniform, and the expectation was entertained that when\r\nthe duty came off, many fancy sizes of bricks would be used. This has\r\nnot, however, turned out to be the case. The duty has been taken off for\r\nyears; but the differences in the size of bricks in England are little\r\nmore than what is due to the different rate of shrinkage of brick earth\r\nunder burning. It must not, however, be supposed that they have always,\r\nand in all countries, been of about the same dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe size and proportions of bricks have varied extremely in different\r\ncountries and in the same country at different periods. Some bricks of\r\nunusual shapes have also been employed from time to time. Other\r\ncountries besides England possess districts which from various\r\ncircumstances have been more or less densely built on, but do not yield\r\nmuch stone or timber; and, accordingly, brickwork is to be met with in\r\nmany localities. Holland and Belgium, for example, are countries of this\r\nsort; and the old connection between Holland and England led to the\r\nintroduction among us, in the reign of William III., of the Dutch style\r\nof building, which has been in our own day revived under the rather\r\nincorrect title of Queen Anne architecture. Another great brick district\r\nexists on the plains of Lombardy and the northern part of Italy\r\ngenerally, and beautiful brickwork, often with enrichments in marble, is\r\nto be found in such cities as Milan, Pavia, Cremona, and Bologna.\r\n\r\nMany cities and towns in Northern Germany are also brick built, and\r\nfurnish good examples of the successful treatment of the material. In\r\nsome of these German buildings, indeed, very difficult pieces of\r\nconstruction, such as we are in the habit of thinking can only be\r\nexecuted in stone, are successfully attempted in brick. For example,\r\nthey execute large tracery windows in this material. Great brick gables,\r\noften with the stepped outline known as crows' feet, are an excellent\r\narchitectural feature of these German brick-built towns. In parts of\r\nFrance, also, ornamental brickwork was from time to time made use of,\r\nbut not extensively. It is not necessary to go very minutely into the\r\nmanufacture of bricks; but perhaps I ought to say a word or two on the\r\nsubject. Good brick earth is not simple clay, but a compound substance;\r\nand what is essential is that it should burn hard or, in other words,\r\npartly vitrify under the action of heat. The brick earth is usually dug\r\nup in the autumn, left for the frosts of winter to break it up, and\r\nworked up in the early spring.\r\n\r\nThe moulding is to a very large extent done by hand, sometimes in a wet\r\nmould, sometimes in a dry sanded mould, and the bricks are first\r\nair-dried, often under some slight shelter, as the rain or frost damages\r\nthem when fresh made; and then, when this process has made them solid\r\nenough to handle, they are burned, and sorted into qualities. The\r\nordinary or stock brick of London and the neighborhood presents a\r\npeculiarity the origin of which is not known, and which is not met with,\r\nso far as I know, in other parts. Very fine coal or cinders is mixed\r\nwith the brick earth, and when the bricks are fired these minute\r\nparticles of fuel scattered through the material all of them burn, and\r\nserve to bake the heart of the brick. Stock bricks are burnt in a clamp\r\nmade of the raw bricks themselves with layers of fuel, and erected on\r\nearth slightly scooped out near the middle, so that as the bricks shrink\r\nthey drop together, and do not fall over sideways.\r\n\r\nMost other varieties of bricks are kiln burnt. A very large number of\r\ninventions for making bricks by machinery have been patented. If you\r\nhave occasion to look through the specifications of these patents, you\r\nwill find four or five main ideas appearing and reappearing, and only\r\nhere and there an invention which is to some extent different from the\r\nothers. A great majority of these inventions include machinery for\r\npreparing the clay or brick earth, so that it may be dug up and filled\r\ninto a receptacle and worked up, screened from pebbles, and made fit for\r\nuse in a short time, so as not to have to wait a whole winter. This is\r\ndone in some sort of pug mill. A pug mill is a machine consisting of a\r\nlarge cylinder with a central shaft passing through it from top to\r\nbottom. Knives or blades are arranged spirally on the shaft, and other\r\nblades project into the interior of the cylinder from the walls of it.\r\nThe material, after being screened, is fed into this at the top, and\r\nproperly moistened. The shaft is caused to rotate, and the blades divide\r\nand subdivide the material, forcing it always downward, so that it at\r\nlast escapes at the bottom of the pug mill in a continuous stream of\r\nmoist, well worked up clay, issuing with some force. In one type of\r\nmachine this clay stream is forced through a square orifice, from which\r\nit comes out of the section of a brick, and by a knife or wire or some\r\nother means it is cut into lengths.\r\n\r\nIn another type of machine there is a large revolving drum working on a\r\nhorizontal axis, with open moulds all round its edge. The clay enters\r\nthese moulds, and there is an arrangement of plungers by which it is\r\nfirst compressed within the mould and then forced out on to an endless\r\nband or some other contrivance that receives it. A third type of machine\r\nhas the moulds in the flat top of a revolving table, which, as it turns,\r\ncarries each mould in succession first to a part where it is filled from\r\nthe pug mill, next to where its contents are compressed, and lastly to\r\nwhere they are pushed out for removal. However made, the brick, when\r\nmoulded, dried, and burnt, and ready for market, belongs to some one\r\nsort, and is distinguished from other sorts by its size, color, quality,\r\nand peculiarities.\r\n\r\nThe sorts of brick that are to be met with in the London market are very\r\nvaried. To enumerate them all would make a tedious list; to describe\r\nthem all would be equally tedious. I will endeavor, however, to give\r\nsome idea of the most conspicuous of them. We will begin with that\r\nfamily of bricks of which the London stock brick is the type. It has\r\nbeen said these are clamp burnt, and almost all the internal\r\nbrickwork--and not a little of the external--of the metropolis is of\r\nstock brickwork. A good London stock brick is an excellent brick for\r\ngeneral purposes, but cannot be called beautiful.\r\n\r\nConsidering the vast quantity of brickwork done in the metropolis, it is\r\na matter for congratulation that such sound materials as good stock\r\nbricks, stone lime, and Thames sand are so easily procurable, and can be\r\nhad at a price that puts them within the reach of all respectable\r\nbuilders. When a clamp has been burnt its contents are found to have\r\nbeen unequally fired, and are part of them underburnt, part well burnt,\r\npart overburnt. They are sorted accordingly into shuffs, grizzles,\r\nstocks of two or three qualities, shippers, and burrs. Several sorts of\r\nmalm stocks, which are superior in color and texture, are made, and are\r\nused for facing bricks and for cutting; and what are called paviors,\r\nwhich are dark and strong bricks, are also made. The London stock is\r\nerroneously, but usually, described as gray. It is really of a pie crust\r\nyellow of various tones. Sometimes it is the same color when cut, but\r\nthe hardest stocks are of a dark, dirty purple or brown, or sometimes\r\nnearly black inside. A stock brick is rarely quite square or quite true;\r\nits surface is often disfigured by black specks and small pits, and a\r\nstack of them often looks uninviting; yet a skillful bricklayer, by\r\nthrowing out the worst, by placing those of bad colors or much out of\r\nshape in the heart of the wall, and by bringing to the front the best\r\nend or side of those bricks which form part of the face, can always make\r\nthe bricks in his work look far better than in the stack. Another\r\nimportant group is the group of Suffolk and Norfolk bricks, red and\r\nwhite. These are very largely employed as facing bricks and for arches\r\nand cut mouldings.\r\n\r\nMoulded bricks are also to a large extent made of the same material.\r\nThese bricks are brought to London in large quantities. They have a\r\nsanded face, are mostly square, true, and of uniform color, but they are\r\nusually porous, soft, and absorbent. Still, they are in great demand as\r\nfacing bricks, and the moulded bricks enable the architect to produce\r\nmany architectural effects at a moderate outlay. These fields furnish\r\nmany sorts of bricks, which are called rubbers, and which are employed\r\n(as malm stocks also are) for arches of the more elaborate sort, where\r\neach brick is cut to its shape and rubbed true, and for mouldings, and\r\neven sometimes for carving.\r\n\r\nMouldings that are formed by cutting the bricks can be got more\r\nperfectly true than when moulded bricks are used; but the expense is\r\ngreater, and when it is done the material is less durable, for the\r\nsofter sorts of brick are naturally used for cutting, and the moulded\r\nface is less sound than the original burnt face of any brick. Red bricks\r\nare to some extent made in fields within easy reach of London; but the\r\nbest come from some distance. Red Suffolk bricks have been alluded to.\r\nThere is a considerable importation of red Fareham bricks, brought all\r\nthe way from the vicinity of Portsmouth; these are good both in quality\r\nand color. Good red bricks are also now made at Ascot, and are being\r\nused to a considerable extent in the metropolis. A strawberry-colored\r\nbrick from Luton has been extensively used at Hampstead. It is hard, and\r\nof a color which contrasts well with stone, but not very pleasing used\r\nalone. Glazed bricks of all colors are obtainable. They are usually very\r\nhard and square, and the use of them where an impervious glazed face is\r\nrequired, as, for example, in a good stable, is better than the\r\nemployment of glazed tiles, in the employment of which there is always a\r\npossibility of part of the lining becoming loose or falling off. There\r\nis a difficulty in obtaining a large quantity (of some colors, at least)\r\nexactly uniform in tint. Bricks with a very hard face, but not glazed,\r\nare obtainable. What is called a washing brick is now made in various\r\ncolors, adapted for the lining of interiors, and there are hard bricks\r\nof a very pale straw color, known as Beart's patent bricks, made, I\r\nbelieve, of gault clay, which were some years ago bought up by the Great\r\nNorthern Railway in large numbers. These bricks have the peculiarity of\r\nbeing pierced with holes about ½ in. in diameter, passing quite through\r\nthe brick, and they are extremely hard, partly because these holes\r\npermit the hot air and smoke in the kiln to approach very near to the\r\ninterior of the brick. I am of opinion that the glazed or dull qualities\r\nof hard bricks might with great advantage be often introduced into\r\nLondon streets. What we want is something that will wash. The rough\r\nsurface of stocks or Suffolk facing bricks catches the black in the\r\nLondon atmosphere and gradually gets dark and dull. A perfectly hard\r\nface is washed clean by every shower. A good many years ago I built a\r\nwarehouse with stock bricks, and formed the arches, strings, etc., of\r\nbricks with a very hard face, and, as I expected, the effect of time has\r\nbeen to make these features stand out far better than when they were\r\nfresh; in fact, the only question is whether they have not now become\r\ntoo conspicuous. To return to the bricks in the London market: we have\r\nfirebricks made of fireclay, and almost vitrified and capable of\r\nstanding intense heat. These are used for lining furnaces, ovens, flues,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThen we have almost, if not quite, as refractory a material in\r\nStaffordshire blue bricks, used--in various forms--for paving channels,\r\njambs of archways, etc. There are also small bricks called clinkers,\r\nchiefly used for stable paving. Dutch clinkers, formerly imported\r\nlargely from Holland, were small, rough bricks, laid on edge, and\r\naffording a good foothold for the horse. Adamantine clinkers, made of\r\ngault clay, are much used; they must have chamfered edges, otherwise\r\nthey make too smooth a floor for a stable. Many other varieties are\r\nobtainable in London, and are more or less used, but these are the most\r\nprominent. In many parts of England special varieties of brick are to be\r\nfound, and every here and there one falls upon a good brickmaker who is\r\nable to produce good moulded or embossed or ornamental bricks, such as\r\nthose which have been supplied to me years ago by Mr. Gunton, and more\r\nrecently by Mr. Brown, both of Norwich, or by Mr. Cooper, of Maidenhead.\r\n\r\nIt is of importance to those whose business it is to look after or\r\nengage in building operations, that they should early learn what to look\r\nout for in each material. Of course, a man only becomes a judge of\r\nbricks, or timber, or stone by experience; but he is far better able to\r\ntake the benefit of experience when it comes to him if he knows from the\r\nfirst to what points to direct attention. Wherefore I make no apology\r\nfor trying to put before you the points of a good brick, and in doing so\r\nI shall partly quote from a memorandum published now a good many years\r\nago by the Manchester Society of Architects.\r\n\r\nA good brick is uniform in size; standard, 9 by 4½ by 2½ in.; weight\r\nabout 7 lb. each = 110 lb. per foot cube; is rectangular, true faced,\r\nbut only one end and one side need be smooth; has no print sinking on\r\neither face, but a hollow on one or both beds. When saturated with\r\nwater, a brick should not absorb more than 20 per cent, of its own\r\nweight of water, should absorb it reluctantly, and part with it freely\r\nat ordinary temperatures. It should be uniformly burnt, should be sound,\r\nfree from cracks, flaws, stones, lumps of any kind, but especially lumps\r\nof lime, should be of a good color for its sort (whether red, yellow, or\r\nwhite), should have a metallic clang when two bricks are struck\r\ntogether; when broken should be sound right through, should be tough and\r\npasty in texture, not granular, and should require repeated blows to\r\nbreak it, rather than one hard blow (such bricks will withstand cartage\r\nand handling best). So much for bricks. To make brickwork, however,\r\nanother ingredient is required--namely, mortar or cement.\r\n\r\nAll mortars and, in fact, all the cementing materials used (except\r\nbituminous ones) in bricklaying have lime as their base, and depend upon\r\nthe setting quality of quicklime, which has to be mixed with sand or\r\nsome suitable substitute for it, to make mortars. Limes and cements are\r\nfar too wide a subject to be dealt with as part of an evening's lecture\r\non another topic, and no doubt they will hereafter form the subject of a\r\nlecture or lectures. To-night I propose only to remind you that there\r\nare such substances as these, and that they possess certain qualities\r\nand are obtainable and available for the bricklayer's purposes, without\r\nattempting an investigation into the chemistry of cements, or their\r\nmanufacture, etc. Ordinarily, brickwork may be divided into brickwork in\r\nmortar and in cement; but there are many qualities of mortar and several\r\nsorts of cement. Mortar made with what are called fat or rich\r\nlimes--that is to say, nearly pure lime, such as is got by calcining\r\nmarble or pure chalk--sets slowly, with difficulty, and is rarely\r\ntenacious. Burnt clay or brick reduced to powder improves the setting of\r\nsuch lime, especially if the two materials be calcined together; so will\r\nan admixture of cement. Mortar made with what is known as slightly\r\nhydraulic lime, that is to say, lime containing a small proportion of\r\nclay, such as the gray stone lime of Dorking, Merstham, and that\r\nneighborhood, sets well, and is tenacious and strong. Mortar made with\r\nhydraulic lime, that is to say, lime with a considerable admixture of\r\nclay, such as the lias lime, sets under water or in contact with wet\r\nearth. It is best to use this lime ground to powder, and not to mix so\r\nmuch sand with it as is used with stone lime. A sort of mortar called\r\nselenitic mortar, the invention of the late General Scott, has been made\r\nuse of in many of the buildings of the School Board for London, and was\r\nfirst employed on a large scale in the erection of the Albert Hall. The\r\npeculiarity consists in the addition of a small dose of plaster of Paris\r\n(sulphate of lime) very carefully introduced and intimately mixed. The\r\nresult is that the mortar so made sets rapidly, and is very hard.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that a larger proportion of sand can be used with\r\nselenitic lime than with ordinary, thus counterbalancing the extra\r\nexpense occasioned by royalty under the patent and special care in\r\nmixing. When a limestone contains 20 to 40 per cent, of clay, it becomes\r\nwhat is called a cement, and its behavior is different from that of\r\nlimestones with less clay. Ordinary limestones are, as you know,\r\ncalcined in a kiln. The material which comes from the kiln is called\r\nquicklime, and, on being dosed with water, it slakes, and crumbles to\r\npowder, and in the state of slaked lime is mixed up with mortar. Cement\r\nstones are also calcined; but the resulting material will not fall to\r\npieces or slake under water. It must be ground very fine, and when\r\nmoistened sets rapidly, and as well under water as in air, and becomes\r\nvery hard and is very tenacious. Brickwork in mortar will always settle\r\nand compress to some extent. Not so brickwork in cement, which\r\noccasionally expands, but is never to be compressed. This quality and\r\nthe rapid setting, tenacity, and strength of brickwork in cement make it\r\na most valuable material to use in those buildings or parts of a\r\nbuilding where great steadiness and strength are wanted, and in sewage\r\nand dock work, where there is water to contend with. A good many cements\r\nmade from natural stones used to be employed, such as Medina, Harwich,\r\nAtkinson's, or Roman cement. The last named is the only one which is now\r\nmuch employed, except locally. It has the quality of setting with\r\nexceptional rapidity, and is on that account sometimes the best material\r\nto employ; but for almost every purpose the artificial compound known as\r\nPortland cement is preferable.\r\n\r\nPortland cement is made largely near Rochester. Its materials are simple\r\nand cheap. They may, without much departure from the truth, be said to\r\nbe Thames mud and chalk; but the process of manufacture requires care\r\nand thoroughness. The article supplied, when of the best quality, has\r\ngreat strength, and is quick setting, and is far better than what was\r\nmanufactured from stones in which the ingredients existed in a state of\r\nnature. In England we slake our lime and make use of it while it is\r\nfresh; but it may interest you to know that the custom in Italy and\r\nparts of France is different. There it is customary to slake the lime\r\nlong before it is wanted, and to deposit it in a pit and cover it up\r\nwith earth. In this condition it is left for months--I believe in Italy\r\nfor a year--and when taken out it is stiff, but still a pasty substance.\r\nIt is beaten, and more water added, and it is then made into mortar with\r\nsand. It is claimed for mortar made in this way that is exceptionally\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nNow that we have considered bricks and partly considered mortar, it\r\nremains to pay some attention to brickwork. The simplest and most\r\nfamiliar work for a bricklayer to do is to build a wall. In doing this\r\nhis object should be to make it as stout as possible for the thickness,\r\nand this stoutness can only be obtained by interlacing the bricks. If\r\nthey were simply laid on the top of each other, the wall would be no\r\nmore than a row of disconnected piles of bricks liable to tumble down.\r\nWhen the whole is so adjusted that throughout the entire wall the joints\r\nin one course shall rest on solid bricks and shall be covered by solid\r\nbricks again--in short, when the whole shall break joint--then this wall\r\nis said to be properly bonded, and has as much stability given to it as\r\nit can possibly possess. There are two systems of bonding in use in\r\nLondon, know as English bond and Flemish bond. English bond is the\r\nmethod which we find followed in ancient brickwork in this country.\r\n\r\nIn this system a course of bricks is laid across the wall, showing their\r\nheads at the surface, hence called \"headers,\" and next above comes a\r\ncourse of bricks stretching lengthways at the wall, called stretchers,\r\nand so on alternately. With the Dutch fashions came in Flemish bond, in\r\nwhich, in each course, a header and a stretcher alternate. In either\r\ncase, at the corners, a quarter-brick called a closer has to be used in\r\neach alternate course to complete the breaking joint. There is not much\r\nto choose between these methods where the walls are only one brick\r\nthick. But where they are thicker the English has a decided advantage,\r\nfor in walls built in Flemish bond of one and a half brick thickness or\r\nmore there must be a few broken bricks, or bats, and there is a strong\r\ntemptation to make use of many. If this takes place, the wall is\r\nunsound.\r\n\r\nMany of the failures of brickwork in London houses arise from the\r\nexternal walls, where they are 1½ bricks thick, being virtually in two\r\nskins; the inner 9 in. does the whole of the work of supporting floors\r\nand roof, and when it begins to fail, the outer face bulges off like a\r\nlarge blister. I have known cases where this had occurred, and where\r\nthere was no header brick for yards, so that one could pass a 5 ft. rod\r\ninto the space between the two skins and turn it about. This is rather\r\nless easy to accomplish with English bond, and there are other\r\nadvantages in the use of that bond which make it decidedly preferable,\r\nand it is now coming back into very general use. There are some odd\r\nvarieties of bond, such as garden bond and chimney bond. But of these I\r\nonly wish to draw your attention to what is called cross bond. The name\r\nis not quite a happy one. Diagonal bond is hardly better. The thing\r\nitself is to be often met with on the Continent, and it is almost\r\nunknown here. But it would be worth introducing, as the effect of it is\r\nvery good.\r\n\r\nFrench cross bond, otherwise diagonal bond _(liaison en croix)_, is\r\nEnglish bond, but with the peculiarity that in every fourth course one\r\nheader is made use of in the stretcher course at the quoin. The result\r\nis that the stretchers break joint with each other, and all the joints\r\nrange themselves in diagonal lines, and if in any part of the work\r\nheaders of a different brick are introduced, the appearance of a cross\r\nis at once brought out; and even without this the diagonal arrangement\r\nof joints is very perceptible and pleasing.\r\n\r\nBesides wall building, the bricklayer has many other works to perform.\r\nHe has to form fireplaces, flues, chimneys, and the flat trimmer arches\r\nwhich support the hearth, and has to set the stove, kitchen range,\r\ncopper, etc., in a proper manner. He has to form various ornamental\r\nfeatures and much else, some of which we shall have an opportunity of\r\nnoticing rather later. The strangest business, however, which is\r\nintrusted to the bricklayer is building downward--by the method known as\r\nunderpinning--so that if a foundation has failed, a sounder one at a\r\ngreater depth may be reached; or if a basement is required under an\r\nexisting building which has none, the space may be excavated and the new\r\nwalls built so as to maintain the old.\r\n\r\nThis work has to be done with great caution, and bit by bit, and is\r\nusually left to experienced hands. The mode in which the mortar joints\r\nof a brick wall are finished where they show on the external or internal\r\nface is a matter worth a moment's attention. It is important that the\r\njoints of the work shall be so finished as to keep out wet and to be as\r\ndurable as possible, and it is desirable that they should improve, or at\r\nany rate not disfigure, the appearance of the work.\r\n\r\nThe method which architects strongly advocate is that the joints shall\r\nbe struck as the work proceeds--that is, that very shortly after a brick\r\nis laid, and while the mortar is yet soft, the bricklayer shall draw his\r\ntrowel, or a tool made for the purpose, across it, to give it a smooth\r\nand a sloping surface. This is best when the joint is what is called a\r\nweather joint--i.e., one in which the joint slopes outward. Sloping it\r\ninward is not good, as it lets in wet; finishing it with a hollow on the\r\nface is often practiced, and is not bad. Bricklayers, however, most of\r\nthem prefer that the mortar joints should be raked out and pointed--that\r\nis to say, an inch or an inch and a half of the mortar next the outer\r\nface be scratched out and replaced with fresh mortar, and finished to a\r\nline.\r\n\r\nIn cases where the brickwork is exposed to frost, this proceeding cannot\r\nbe avoided, because the frost damages the external mortar of the joints.\r\nBut the bricklayers prefer it at all seasons of the year, partly because\r\nbrickwork is more quickly done if joints are not struck at the time;\r\npartly because they can, if they like, wash the whole surface of the\r\nwork with ocher, or other color, to improve the tint; and partly\r\nbecause, whether the washing is done or not, it smartens up the\r\nappearance of the work. The misfortune is that this pointing, instead of\r\nbeing the edge of the same mortar that goes right through, is only the\r\nedge of a narrow strip, and does not hold on to the old undisturbed\r\nmortar, and so is far less sound, and far more liable to decay. There is\r\na system of improving the appearance of old, decayed work by raking out\r\nand filling up the joint, and then making a narrow mortar joint in the\r\nmiddle of this filling in, and projecting from the face. This is called\r\ntuck pointing. It is very specious, but it is not sound work.\r\n\r\nBrick arches are constantly being turned, and of many sorts. An arch\r\nconsists of a series of wedge shaped blocks, known as voussoirs,\r\narranged in a curve, and so locking one another together that unless the\r\nabutments from which the arch springs give way, it will not only carry\r\nitself, but sustain a heavy load. It is a constant practice to cut\r\nbricks to this shape and build them into an arch, and these are\r\nsometimes cut and rubbed; sometimes, when the work is rougher, they are\r\naxed. But in order to save the labor of cutting, arches are sometimes\r\nturned with the bricks left square, and the joints wedge shaped. In this\r\ncase the rings should be only half a brick each, so that the wedge need\r\nnot be so very much wider at back than at face, and they are set in\r\ncement, as that material adheres so closely and sets so hard. Arches of\r\ntwo or more half-brick rings in cement are good construction, and are\r\nalso used for culvert work.\r\n\r\nA less satisfactory sort of arch is what is called the flat arch. Here,\r\ninstead of being cambered as it ought to be, the soffit is straight; but\r\nthe brickwork being deep, there is room enough for a true arch that does\r\nthe work, and for useless material to hang from it. These arches are\r\ngenerally rubbed or axed, and are very common at the openings of\r\nordinary windows. But no one who has studied construction can look at\r\nthem without a kind of wish for at least a slight rise, were it only two\r\ninches. Sometimes when these straight arches are to be plastered over\r\nthey are constructed in a very clumsy manner, which is anything but\r\nsound, and from time to time they give way. The weight of brickwork, of\r\ncourse, varies with the weight of the individual bricks. But stock\r\nbrickwork in mortar weighs just about one hundred weight per cubic foot,\r\nor 20 cubic feet to the ton. In cement it is heavier, about 120 lb. to\r\nthe cubic foot.\r\n\r\nThe strength of brickwork depends of course on the strength of the\r\nweakest material--i.e., the mortar--though when it is in cement the\r\nstrength of brickwork to withstand a weight probably approaches that of\r\nthe individual bricks. Some experiments quoted in Rivington's Notes give\r\nthe following as the crushing weight per foot--that is to say, weight at\r\nwhich crushing began--of piers having a height of less than twelve times\r\ntheir diameter:\r\n\r\n                                             Tons per\r\n                                               foot.\r\n  Best stocks, set in Portland cement and\r\n    sand 1 to 1, and three months old.          40\r\n  Ordinary good stocks, three months old.       30\r\n  Hard stocks, Roman cement and sand 1 to 1,\r\n    three months old.                           28\r\n  Hard stocks, lias lime, and sand 1 to 2,\r\n    and six months old.                         24\r\n  Hard stocks, gray chalk lime, and sand,\r\n    six months old.                             12\r\n\r\nThe rule given in popular handbook, that brickwork in mortar should not\r\nhave to carry more than three tons per superficial foot, and in cement\r\nmore than five tons, is probably sound, as in no building ought the load\r\nto approach the crushing point, and, indeed, there are many sorts of\r\nfoundations on which such a load as five tons per foot would be too\r\ngreat to be advisable.\r\n\r\nIt is a rather interesting inquiry, whenever we are dealing with a\r\nbuilding material, if we ask what can we best do with it, and for what\r\nis it ill fitted. The purposes for which brick can be best used depend,\r\nof course, upon its qualities. Speaking generally, such purposes are\r\nvery numerous and very various, especially the utilitarian purposes,\r\nthough rich and varied ornamental work can also be executed in\r\nbrickwork.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable quality of brickwork is that it can be\r\nthrown into almost any shape. It is in this respect almost like a\r\nplastic material, and this peculiarity it owes chiefly to the very small\r\nsize of each brick as compared with the large masses of the brickwork of\r\nmost buildings. Stone is far less easily dealt with than brick in this\r\nrespect. Think for a moment of the great variety of walls, footings,\r\npiers, pilasters, openings, recesses, flues, chimney breasts, chimney\r\nshafts, vaults, arches, domes, fireproof floors, corbels, strings,\r\ncappings, panels, cornices, plinths, and other features met with in\r\nconstant use, and all formed by the bricklayer with little trouble out\r\nof the one material--brickwork! A little consideration will convince you\r\nthat if the same material furnishes all these, it must be very plastic.\r\nAs a limitation we ought to note that this almost plastic material\r\ncannot be suddenly and violently dealt with--that is to say, with the\r\nexception of some sorts of arches, you cannot form any abrupt or\r\nstartling feature in brickwork, and you are especially limited as to\r\nprojections.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to throw out any bold projection, you may support it on a\r\nlong and sloping corbel of brickwork. But if there is not room for that,\r\nyou must call in some other material, and form the actual support in\r\nstone, or terra cotta, or iron, and when you have gained your\r\nprojection, you may then go on in brickwork if you like.\r\n\r\nBrick cornices should be steep, but cannot be bold, and so with other\r\nornamental and structural features. A noteworthy property of brickwork,\r\nand one of immense value, is that it is thoroughly fireproof; in fact,\r\nalmost the only perfectly fireproof material. There is an interesting\r\naccount of the great fire of London by one of the eye witnesses, and\r\namong the striking phenomena of that awful time he notes that the few\r\nbrick buildings which existed were the only ones able to withstand the\r\nraging fire when it reached them.\r\n\r\nIn our own day a striking proof of the same thing was given in the great\r\nfire in Tooley street, when Braidwood lost his life. I witnessed that\r\nconflagration for a time from London Bridge, and its fury was something\r\nnot to be described. There were vaults under some of the warehouses\r\nstored with inflammable materials, the contents of which caught fire and\r\nburnt for a fortnight, defying all attempts to put them out. Yet these\r\nvery vaults, though they were blazing furnaces for all that time, were\r\nnot materially injured. When the warehouses came to be reinstated, it\r\nwas only found necessary to repair and repoint them a little, and they\r\nwere retained in use. The fact is that the bricks have been calcined\r\nalready, so has the lime in the mortar, and the sand is not affected by\r\nheat, so there is nothing in brickwork to burn. Against each of these\r\ngood qualities, however, we may set a corresponding defect.\r\n\r\nIf brickwork is easily thrown into any shape, it is also easily thrown\r\nout of shape. It has little coherence or stability, less than masonry\r\nand very considerably less than timber. If any unequal settlement in the\r\nfoundation of a brick building occurs, those long zigzag cracks with\r\nwhich we in London are only too familiar set themselves up at once; and\r\nif any undue load, or any variation in load, exists, the brickwork\r\nbegins to bulge. Any serious shock may cause a building of ordinary\r\nbrickwork to collapse altogether, and from time to time a formidable\r\naccident occurs owing to this cause. The fact is, the bricks are each so\r\nsmall compared to the mass of the work, and the tenacity or hold upon\r\nthem of even fairly good lime mortar is so comparatively slight, that\r\nthere is really but little grip of one put upon another.\r\n\r\nPersons who have to design and construct brick buildings should never\r\nforget that they have to be handled with caution, and are really very\r\nticklish and unstable. One or two of the methods of overcoming this to\r\nsome extent may be mentioned. The first is the introduction of what is\r\ncalled bond. At the end of the last century it was usual to build in, at\r\nevery few feet in height, bond timbers, which were embedded in the heart\r\nof the walls. If these had always remained indestructible, they would no\r\ndoubt have served their purpose to some extent. Unfortunately, timber\r\nboth rots and burns, and this bond timber has brought down many a wall\r\nowing to its being destroyed by fire, and has in other cases decayed\r\naway, and caused cracks, settlements, and failures.\r\n\r\nThe more modern method of introducing a strong horizontal tie is to\r\nbuild into the wall a group of bands of thin iron, such as some sorts of\r\nbarrels are hooped with--hence called hoop iron. The courses of bricks\r\nwhere this occurs must be laid in cement, because iron in contact with\r\ncement does not perish as it does in contact with mortar.\r\n\r\nIf in every story of a building four or five courses are thus laid and\r\nfortified, a great deal of strength is given to the structure. Another\r\nmethod, which has rather fallen into disuse, is grouting. This is\r\npouring liquid mortar, about the consistency of gruel, upon the work at\r\nabout every fourth course. The result is to fill up all interstices and\r\ncavities, and to delay the drying of the mortar, and brickwork so\r\ntreated sets extremely hard. I have seen a wall that had been so treated\r\ncut into, and it was quite as easy to cut the bricks (sound ones though\r\nthey were) as the mortar joints.\r\n\r\nGrouting is objected to because it interferes with the good look of the\r\nwork, as it is very difficult to prevent streaks of it from running down\r\nthe face, and it is apt to delay the work. But it is a valuable means of\r\nobtaining strong brickwork. Another and a more popular method is to\r\nbuild the work in cement, now usually Portland cement. This, of course,\r\nmakes very strong, sound work, and does not involve any delay or dirt\r\nlike grouting, or the introduction of any fresh material like hoop iron.\r\nBut it, of course, adds to the expense of the work considerably, as\r\ncement is much more costly than lime. I ought to add that the advocates\r\nof Scott's selenitic mortar claim that it not only sets quickly and\r\nhard, but that it is extremely tenacious, and consequently makes a much\r\nmore robust wall than ordinary mortar. I dare say this is true; but I\r\nhave not happened to see such a wall cut into, and this is the best test\r\nof solidity.\r\n\r\nThe second deficiency in brickwork which I am bound to notice is that,\r\nthough it is very fireproof, it is far from being waterproof. In an\r\nexposed situation rain will drive completely through a tolerably stout\r\nbrick wall. If water be allowed to drop or fall against it, the wall\r\nwill become saturated like a sponge. If the foot of a wall becomes wet,\r\nor if the earth resting against the lower parts of it be moist, water\r\nwill, if not checked, rise to a great height in it, and if the upper\r\npart of the wall be wet, the water will sink downward. With most sorts\r\nof brick the outer face absorbs moisture whenever the weather is moist;\r\nand in time the action of the rain, and the subsequent action of frost\r\nupon the moisture so taken up, destroys the mortar in the joints, which\r\nare to be seen perfectly open, as if they had been raked out, in old\r\nbrickwork, and in some cases (happily not in many) the action of weather\r\ndestroys the bricks themselves, the face decaying away, and the brick\r\nbecoming soft.\r\n\r\nAgainst this serious defect in our staple building material a series of\r\nprecautions have been devised. Damp rising from the foot of the wall, or\r\nfrom earth lying round its base, is combated by a damp course--a bed of\r\nsome impervious material going through the wall. Damp earth may be kept\r\noff by surrounding the walls with an open area or a closed one--usually\r\ntermed a dry area. Damp against the face of the walls may be partly\r\ncombated by a careful selection of a non-absorbent brick with a hard\r\nface and by struck joints. But it is most effectually kept at bay by the\r\nexpedient of building the wall hollow; that is to say, making the\r\nexternal wall of the house to consist of two perfectly distinct walls,\r\nstanding about 2 in. apart, and held together by ties of earthenware or\r\niron. The result is that the moisture blowing through the outer skin\r\ndoes not pass the cavity, but trickles down on the inner face of the\r\nouter wall, while the inner wall remains dry. The ties are constructed\r\nof shapes to prevent their conducting water themselves from without to\r\nthe inner wall. In addition to this, a series of slates forming an\r\nintermediate protection is sometimes introduced, and forms an additional\r\nand most valuable screen against weather. Sometimes, the two skins of\r\nthe wall are closer together--say ¾ in.--and the space is filled with a\r\nbituminous material.\r\n\r\nA substance of a bituminous nature, called hygeian rock, has been of\r\nlate years introduced, and is being extensively used for this purpose;\r\nit is melted and poured into the open space hot, and quickly hardens.\r\nThe use of such a material is open to the objection that no air can pass\r\nthrough it. The rooms of our houses are receiving air constantly through\r\nthe walls, and much of the constant current up our chimneys is supplied,\r\nto our great advantage, in this very imperceptible manner. The house\r\nbreathes, so to speak, through the pores of its brickwork. When this is\r\nrendered impossible, it seems clear that fiercer draughts will enter\r\nthrough the chinks and crevices, and that there will be a greater demand\r\nupon flues not in use, occasioning down draught in the chimneys.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of keeping out weather is to cement the face of the\r\nbrickwork. But this hides up the work, and so tends to promote bad work,\r\nbesides being often very unsightly.\r\n\r\nAmong other peculiarities of brickwork are the facilities for\r\nintroducing different colors and different textures of surface which it\r\npresents, the ease with which openings and arches can be formed in it,\r\nthe possibility of executing ornament and even carving, and the ease\r\nwith which brickwork will combine with other building materials. It\r\ncannot be well made use of for columns, though it may readily enough be\r\nturned into piers or pilasters. It cannot, generally speaking, with\r\nadvantage be made use of for any large domes, though the inner dome of\r\nSt. Paul's and the intermediate cone are of brick, and stand well. But\r\nit is an excellent material for vaulting arcades and all purposes\r\ninvolving the turning of arches.\r\n\r\nBrickwork must be said to be durable, but it requires care. If not of\r\nthe best, brickwork within the reach of the constant vibration caused by\r\nthe traffic on a railway seems to be in danger of being shaken to\r\npieces, judging from one or two instances that have come under my own\r\nobservation. The mortar, and even in some cases the bricks themselves,\r\nwill rapidly deteriorate if moisture be allowed to get into the heart of\r\na brick wall, and in exposed situations this is very apt to happen. Care\r\nshould always be taken to keep the pointing of external brickwork in\r\ngood order, and to maintain all copings and other projections intended\r\nto bar the access of water coming down from above, and to stop the\r\noverflowing of gutters and stack pipes, which soon soaks the wall\r\nthrough and through.\r\n\r\nOf course, if there is a failure of foundations, brickwork, as was\r\npointed out earlier, becomes affected at once. But if these be good, and\r\nthe materials used be sound ones, and if the other precautions just\r\nrecommended be taken, it will last strong and sturdy for an immense\r\nlength of time. In some cases, as for example in the Roman ruins, it has\r\nstood for 1,500 years under every possible exposure and neglect, and\r\nstill shows something of a sturdy existence after all, though sadly\r\nmutilated. If we now return to the question, What can be well done in\r\nbrickwork? no better answer can be given than to point to what has been\r\nand is being done, especially in London and within our own reach and\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nGreat engineering works, such as railway viaducts, the lining of railway\r\ntunnels, the piers and even the arches of bridges, sewage works, dock\r\nand wharf walls, furnace chimneys, and other works of this sort are\r\nchiefly done in brickwork. And notwithstanding that iron is far more\r\nused by the engineer for some purposes and concrete for others now than\r\nformerly, still there is a great field for brickwork. The late Mr.\r\nBrunel, who was fond of pushing size to extremes, tried how wide a span\r\nhe could arch over with brickwork. And I believe the bridge which\r\ncarries the G.W.R. over the Thames at Maidenhead has the widest arch he\r\nor any other engineer has successfully erected in brick. This arch has,\r\nit is stated, a span of 128 ft. It is segmental, the radius being 169\r\nft., and the rise from springing to crown 24 ft., and the depth of the\r\narch 5 ft. 3 in. Nowadays, of course, no one would dream of anything but\r\nan iron girder bridge in such a position. Mr. Brunel's father, when he\r\nconstructed the Thames Tunnel, lined it with brickwork foot by foot as\r\nhe went on, and that lining sustained the heavy weight of the bed of the\r\nriver and the river itself.\r\n\r\nIf you leave London by either of the southern lines, all of which are at\r\na high level, you go for miles on viaducts consisting of brick arches\r\ncarried on brick walls. If you leave by the northern lines, you plunge\r\ninto tunnel after tunnel lined with brickwork, and kept secure by such\r\nlining. Mile after mile of London streets, and those in the suburbs,\r\npresent to the eye little but brick buildings; dwelling houses, shops,\r\nwarehouses, succeed one another, all in brickwork, and even when the eye\r\nseems to catch a change, it is more apparent than real.\r\n\r\nThe white mansions of Tyburnia, Belgravia, South Kensington, and the\r\nneat villas of the suburbs are only brickwork, with a thin coat of\r\nstucco, which serves the purpose of concealing the real structure--often\r\nonly too much in need of concealment--with a material supposed to be a\r\nlittle more sightly, and certainly capable of keeping the weather out\r\nrather more effectually than common brickwork would.\r\n\r\nMore than this, such fine structures, apparently built entirely of\r\nstone, as are being put up for commercial purposes in the streets of the\r\ncity, and for public purposes throughout London, are all of them nothing\r\nmore than brick fabrics with a facing of masonry. Examine one of them in\r\nprogress, and you will find the foundations and vaults of brickwork, and\r\nnot only the interior walls, but the main part of the front wall,\r\nexecuted in brickwork, and the stone only skin deep. There are, however,\r\ntwo or three ways of making use of brickwork without covering it up, and\r\nof gaining good architectural effects thereby, and to these I beg now to\r\ndirect your attention.\r\n\r\nThe architect who desires to make an effective brick building, which\r\nshall honestly proclaim to all the world that it is of brick, may do\r\nthis, and, if he will, may do it successfully, by employing brickwork\r\nand no other material, but making the best use of the opportunities\r\nwhich it affords, or he may erect his building of brickwork and stone\r\ncombined, or of brickwork and terra cotta. Mr. Robson, till lately the\r\narchitect to the School Board for London, has the merit of having put\r\ndown in every part of the metropolis a series of well contrived and well\r\ndesigned buildings, the exterior of which almost without exception\r\nconsists of brickwork only.\r\n\r\nIf you examine one of his school-houses, you will see that the walls are\r\nof ordinary stock brickwork, but usually brightened up by a little red\r\nbrick at each angle, and surmounted by well contrasted gables and with\r\nlofty, well designed chimneys, rising from the tiled roof. The window\r\nopenings and doorways are marked by brickwork, usually also red, and\r\nsometimes moulded, and though I personally must differ from the taste\r\nwhich selected some of the forms employed (they are those in use in this\r\ncountry in the 17th and the last centuries), I cordially recognize that\r\nwith very simple and inexpensive means exceedingly good, appropriate,\r\nand effective buildings have been designed.\r\n\r\nAmong examples of architecture wholly, or almost wholly, executed in red\r\nbrick, I cannot pass over a building built many years ago, little known\r\non account of its obscure situation, but a gem in its way. I allude to\r\nthe schools designed by Mr. Wilde, and built in Castle street, Endell\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nOf buildings where a small amount of stone is introduced into brickwork\r\nwe have a good many fine specimens in London. One of the best--probably\r\nthe best--is the library in Lincoln's Inn Fields. This is a large and\r\npicturesque pile, built under Mr. Hardwick, as architect, in red brick,\r\nwith patterns in the blank parts of the walls done in black brick. It\r\nhas splendid moulded brick chimneys, and the mullions of the windows,\r\nthe copings, the entrances, and some other architectural features done\r\nin stone. The building is a good reproduction of the style of building\r\nin Tudor times, when, as has been already mentioned, brickwork was taken\r\ninto favor.\r\n\r\nAnother building of the same class, but not so good, is the older part\r\nof the Consumption Hospital, at Brompton. Brickwork, with a little\r\nstone, has been very successfully employed as the material for churches,\r\nand in many such cases the interior is of unplastered brickwork. Such\r\nchurches often attain, when designed by skillful hands, great dignity\r\nand breadth of effect. St. Albans, Holborn; the great church designed by\r\nMr. Butterfield, in Margaret street; Mr. Street's church near Vincent\r\nsquare, Westminster; and several churches of Mr. Brooks', such as he was\r\nkind enough to enable me to illustrate tonight, may be mentioned as\r\nexamples of the sort. Mr. Waterhouse has built an elaborate\r\nCongregational church at Hampstead, which shows the use with which such\r\neffects of color may be obtained in interiors, and has kindly lent some\r\ndrawings. Mr. Pearson's church at Kilburn may also be referred to as a\r\nfine example of brick vaulting. Brick and terra cotta seem to have a\r\nnatural affinity for one another. Terra cotta is no more than a refined\r\nbrick, made of the same sort of material, only in every respect more\r\ncarefully, and kiln baked. Its similarity to brick is such that there is\r\nno sense of incongruity if moulded or carved brickwork and terra cotta\r\nare both employed in the same building, and this can hardly be said to\r\nbe the case if the attempt is made to combine ornamental brickwork and\r\nstone ornaments.\r\n\r\nAt South Kensington, a whole group of examples of brickwork with terra\r\ncotta meet us. The Natural History Museum, the finest of them all, is\r\nhardly fit for our present purpose, as it is as completely encased in\r\nterra cotta as the fronts of the buildings in this avenue are in stone.\r\nBut here are the Albert Hall, a fine specimen of mass and effect; the\r\nCity and Guilds Institute; the College of Music, and some private houses\r\nand blocks of flats, all in red brick with terra cotta, and all showing\r\nthe happy manner in which the two materials can be blended. In most of\r\nthem there is a contrast of color; but Mr. Waterhouse, in the Technical\r\nInstitute, has employed red terra cotta with red bricks, as he also has\r\ndone in his fine St. Paul's School at Hammersmith, and Mr. Norman Shaw\r\nhas, in his fine pile of buildings in St. James' street. This\r\ncombination--namely, brick and terra cotta--I look upon as the best for\r\nwithstanding the London climate, and for making full use of the\r\ncapabilities of brickwork that can be employed, and I have no doubt that\r\nin the future it will be frequently resorted to. Some of those examples\r\nalso show the introduction of cast ornaments, and others the employment\r\nof carving as means of enriching the surface of brick walls with\r\nexcellent effect. Here we must leave the subject; but in closing, I\r\ncannot forbear pointing to the art of the bricklayer as a fine example\r\nof what may be accomplished by steady perseverance. Every brick in the\r\nmiles of viaducts or tunnels, houses, or public buildings, to which we\r\nhave made allusion, was laid separately, and it is only steady\r\nperseverance, brick after brick, on the part of the bricklayer, which\r\ncould have raised these great masses of work. Let me add that no one\r\nbrick out of the many laid is of no importance. Some time ago a great\r\nfire occurred in a public asylum, and about £2,000 of damage was done,\r\nand the lives of many of the inmates endangered. When the origin of this\r\nfire came to be traced out, it was found that it was due to one brick\r\nbeing left out in a flue. A penny would be a high estimate of the cost\r\nof that brick and of the expense of laying it, yet through the neglect\r\nof that pennyworth, £2,000 damage was done, and risk of human life was\r\nrun. I think there is a moral in this story which each of us can make\r\nout if he will.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA fireproof whitewash can be readily made by adding one part silicate of\r\nsoda (or potash) to every five parts of whitewash. The addition of a\r\nsolution of alum to whitewash is recommended as a means to prevent the\r\nrubbing off of the wash. A coating of a good glue size made by\r\ndissolving half a pound of glue in a gallon of water is employed when\r\nthe wall is to be papered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHENOMENA OF ALTERNATING CURRENTS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From a paper read before the recent meeting of the American\r\nInstitute of Electrical Engineers, New York, and reported in the\r\n_Electrical World_.]\r\n\r\nBy Prof. ELIHU THOMSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe actions produced and producible by the agency of alternating\r\ncurrents of considerable energy are assuming greater importance in the\r\nelectric arts. I mean, of course, by the term alternating currents,\r\ncurrents of electricity reversed at frequent intervals, so that a\r\npositive flow is succeeded by a negative flow, and that again by a\r\npositive flow, such reversals occurring many times in a second, so that\r\nthe curve of current of electromotive force will, if plotted, be a wave\r\nline, the amplitude of which is the arithmetical sum of the positive and\r\nnegative maxima of current or electromotive force, as the case may be,\r\nwhile a horizontal middle line joins the zero points of current or\r\nelectromotive force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\r\n\r\nIt is well known that such a current passing in a coil or conductor laid\r\nparallel with or in inductive relation to a second coil or conductor,\r\nwill induce in the second conductor, if on open circuit, alternating\r\nelectromotive forces, and that if its terminals be closed or joined,\r\nalternating currents of the same rhythm, period, or pitch, will\r\ncirculate in the second conductor. This is the action occurring in any\r\ninduction coil whose primary wire is traversed by alternating currents,\r\nand whose secondary wire is closed either upon itself directly or\r\nthrough a resistance. What I desire to draw attention to in the present\r\npaper are the mechanical actions of attraction and repulsion which will\r\nbe exhibited between the two conductors, and the novel results which may\r\nbe obtained by modifications in the relative dispositions of the two\r\nconductors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nIn 1884, while preparing for the International Electrical Exhibition at\r\nPhiladelphia, we had occasion to construct a large electro-magnet, the\r\ncores of which were about six inches in diameter and about twenty inches\r\nlong. They were made of bundles of iron rod of about 5/16 inch diameter.\r\nWhen complete, the magnet was energized by the current of a dynamo\r\ngiving continuous currents, and it exhibited the usual powerful magnetic\r\neffects. It was found also that a disk of sheet copper, of about 1/16\r\ninch thickness and 10 inches in diameter, if dropped flat against a pole\r\nof the magnet, would settle down softly upon it, being retarded by the\r\ndevelopment of currents in the disk due to its movement in a strong\r\nmagnetic field, and which currents were of opposite direction to those\r\nin the coils of the magnet. In fact, it was impossible to strike the\r\nmagnet pole a sharp blow with the disk, even when the attempt was made\r\nby holding one edge of the disk in the hand and bringing it down\r\nforcibly toward the magnet. In attempting to raise the disk quickly off\r\nthe pole, a similar but opposite action of resistance to movement took\r\nplace, showing the development of currents in the same direction to\r\nthose in the coils of the magnet, and which currents, of course, would\r\ncause attraction as a result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\r\n\r\nThe experiment was, however, varied, as in Fig. 1. The disk, D, was held\r\nover the magnet pole, as shown, and the current in the magnet coils cut\r\noff by shunting them. There was felt an attraction of the disk or a dip\r\ntoward the pole. The current was then put on by opening the shunting\r\nswitch, and a repulsive action or lift of the disk was felt. The actions\r\njust described are what would be expected in such a case, for when\r\nattraction took place, currents had been induced in the disk, D, in the\r\nsame direction as those in the magnet coils beneath it, and when\r\nrepulsion took place the induced current in the disk was of opposite\r\ncharacter or direction to that in the coils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4]\r\n\r\nNow let us imagine the current in the magnet coils to be not only cut\r\noff, but reversed back and forth.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons just given, we will find that the disk, D, is attracted\r\nand repelled alternately; for, whenever the currents induced in it are\r\nof the same direction with those in the inducing or magnet coil,\r\nattraction will ensue, and when they are opposite in direction,\r\nrepulsion will be produced. Moreover, the repulsion will be produced\r\nwhen the current in the magnet coil is rising to a maximum in either\r\ndirection, and attraction will be the result when the current of either\r\ndirection is falling to zero, since in the former case opposite currents\r\nare induced in the disk, D, in accordance with well known laws, and in\r\nthe latter case currents of the same direction will exist in the disk,\r\nD, and the magnet coil. The disk might, of course, be replaced by a ring\r\nof copper or other good conductor, or by a closed coil of bare or\r\ninsulated wire, or by a series of disks, rings or coils superposed, and\r\nthe results would be the same. Thus far, indeed, we have nothing of a\r\nparticularly novel character, and, doubtless, other experimenters have\r\nmade very similar experiments and noted similar results to those\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5]\r\n\r\nThe account just given of the effects produced by alternating currents,\r\nwhile true, is not the whole truth, and just here we may supplement it\r\nby the following statements:\r\n\r\n_An alternating current circuit or coil repels and attracts a closed\r\ncircuit or coil placed in direct or magnetic inductive relation\r\ntherewith; but the repulsive effect is in excess of the attractive\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nWhen the closed circuit or coil is so placed, and is of such low\r\nresistance metal that a comparatively large current can circulate as an\r\ninduced current, so as to be subject to a large self-induction, the\r\nrepulsive far exceeds the attractive effort_.\r\n\r\nFor want of a better name, I shall call this excess of repulsive effect\r\nthe \"electro-inductive repulsion\" of the coils or circuits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nThis preponderating repulsive effect may be utilized or may show its\r\npresence by producing movement or pressure in a given direction, by\r\nproducing angular deflection as of a pivoted body, or by producing\r\ncontinuous rotation with a properly organized structure. Some of the\r\nsimple devices realizing the conditions I will now describe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 2, C is a coil traversed by alternating currents. B is a copper\r\ncase or tube surrounding it, but not exactly over its center. The copper\r\ntube, B, is fairly massive and is the seat of heavy induced currents.\r\nThere is a preponderance of repulsive action, tending to force the two\r\nconductors apart in an axial line. The part, B, may be replaced by\r\nconcentric tubes slid one in the other, or by a pile of flat rings, or\r\nby a closed coil of coarse or fine wire insulated, or not. If the coil,\r\nC, or primary coil, is provided with an iron core such as a bundle of\r\nfine iron wires, the effects are greatly increased in intensity, and the\r\nrepulsion with a strong primary current may become quite vigorous, many\r\npounds of thrust being producible by apparatus of quite moderate size.\r\n\r\nThe forms and relations of the two parts, C and B, may be greatly\r\nmodified, with the general result of a preponderance of repulsive action\r\nwhen the alternating currents circulate.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 shows the part, B, of an internally tapered or coned form, and C\r\nof an externally coned form, wound on an iron wire bundle, I. The action\r\nin Fig. 2 may be said to be analogous to that of a plain solenoid with\r\nits core, except that repulsion, and not attraction, is produced, while\r\nthat of Fig. 3 is more like the action of tapered or conically wound\r\nsolenoids and taper cores. Of course, it is unnecessary that both be\r\ntapered. The effect of such shaping is simply to modify the range of\r\naction and the amount of repulsive effort existing at different parts of\r\nthe range.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 4 the arrangement is modified so that the coil, C, is outside,\r\nand the closed band or circuit, B, inside and around the core, I.\r\nElectro-inductive repulsion is produced as before.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident that the repulsive actions will not be mechanically\r\nmanifested by axial movement or effort when the electrical middles of\r\nthe coils or circuits are coincident. In cylindrical coils in which the\r\ncurrent is uniformly distributed through all the parts of the conductor\r\nsection, what I here term the electrical middle, or the center of\r\ngravity of the ampere turns of the coils, will be the plane at right\r\nangles to its axis at its middle, that of B and C, in Fig. 4, being\r\nindicated by a dotted line. To repeat, then, when the centers or center\r\nplanes of the conductors, Fig. 4, coincide, no indication of\r\nelectro-inductive repulsion is given, because it is mutually balanced in\r\nall directions; but when the coils are displaced, a repulsion is\r\nmanifested, which reaches a maximum at a position depending on the\r\npeculiarities of proportion and distribution of current at any time in\r\nthe two circuits or conductors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose now to discuss the ways of determining the\r\ndistribution of currents and mechanical effects, as that would extend\r\nthe present paper much beyond its intended limit. The forms and relative\r\narrangement of the two conductors may be greatly varied. In Fig. 5 the\r\nparts are of equal diameter, one, B, being a closed ring, and the other,\r\nC, being an annular coil placed parallel thereto; and an iron core or\r\nwire bundle placed in the common axis of the two coils increases the\r\nrepulsive action. B may be simply a disk or plate of any form, without\r\ngreatly affecting the nature of the action produced. It may also be\r\ncomposed of a pile of copper washers or a coil of wire, as before\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nAn arrangement of parts somewhat analogous to that of a horseshoe\r\nelectro magnet and armature is shown in Fig. 6. The alternating current\r\ncoils, C C', are wound upon an iron wire bundle bent into U form, and\r\nopposite its poles is placed a pair of thick copper disks, B B', which\r\nare attracted and repelled, but with an excess of repulsion depending on\r\ntheir form, thickness, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nIf the iron core takes the form of that shown by I I, Fig. 7, such as a\r\ncut ring with the coil, C, wound thereon, the insertion of a heavy\r\ncopper plate, B, into the slot or divided portion of the ring will be\r\nopposed by a repulsive effort when alternating currents pass in C. This\r\nwas the first form of device in which I noticed the phenomenon of\r\nrepulsive preponderance in question. The tendency is to thrust the\r\nplate, B, out of the slot in the ring excepting only when its center is\r\ncoincident with the magnetic axis joining the poles of the ring between\r\nwhich B is placed.\r\n\r\nIf the axes of the conductors, Fig. 5, are not coincident, but\r\ndisplaced, as in Fig. 8, then, besides a simple repulsion apart, there\r\nis a lateral component or tendency, as indicated by the arrows. Akin to\r\nthis is the experiment illustrated in Fig. 9. Here the closed conductor,\r\nB, is placed with its plane at right angles to that of C, wound on a\r\nwire bundle. The part, B, tends to move toward the center of the coil,\r\nC, so that its axis will be in the middle plane of C, transverse to the\r\ncore, as indicated by the dotted line. This leads us at once to another\r\nclass of actions, i.e., deflective actions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\nWhen one of the conductors, as B, Fig. 10, composed of a disk, or,\r\nbetter, of a pile of thin copper disks, or of a closed coil of wire, is\r\nmounted on an axis, X, transverse to the axis of coil, C, through which\r\ncoil the alternating current passes, a deflection of B to the position\r\nindicated by dotted lines will take place, unless the plane of B is at\r\nthe start exactly coincident with that of C. If slightly inclined at the\r\nstart, deflection will be caused as stated. It matters not whether the\r\ncoil, C, incloses the part, B, or be inclosed by it, or whether the\r\ncoil, C, be pivoted and B fixed, or both be pivoted. In Fig. 11 the\r\ncoil, C, surrounds an iron wire core, and B is pivoted above it, as\r\nshown. It is deflected, as before, to the position indicated in dotted\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13]\r\n\r\nIt is important to remark here that in cases where deflection is to be\r\nobtained, as in Figs. 10 and 11, B had best be made of a pile of thin\r\nwashers or a closed coil of insulated wire instead of a solid ring. This\r\navoids the lessening of effect which would come from the induction of\r\ncurrents in the ring, B, in other directions than parallel to its\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\nWe will now turn our attention to the explanation of the actions\r\nexhibited, and afterward refer to their possible applications. It may be\r\nstated as certainly true that were the induced currents in the closed\r\nconductor unaffected by any self-induction, the only phenomena exhibited\r\nwould be alternate equal attractions and repulsions, because currents\r\nwould be induced in opposite directions to that of the primary current\r\nwhen the latter current was changing from zero to maximum positive or\r\nnegative current, so producing repulsion; and would be induced in the\r\nsame direction when changing from maximum positive or negative value to\r\nzero, so producing attraction.\r\n\r\nThis condition can be illustrated by a diagram, Fig. 12. Here the lines\r\nof zero current are the horizontal straight lines. The wavy lines\r\nrepresent the variations of current strength in each conductor, the\r\ncurrent in one direction being indicated by that portion of the curve\r\nabove the zero line, and in the other direction by that portion below\r\nit. The vertical dotted lines simply mark off corresponding portions of\r\nphase or succession of times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15]\r\n\r\nHere it will be seen that in the positive primary current descending\r\nfrom m, its maximum, to the zero line, the secondary current has risen\r\nfrom its zero to m¹, its maximum. Attraction will therefore ensue, for\r\nthe currents are in the same direction in the two conductors. When the\r\nprimary current increases from zero to its negative maximum, n, the\r\npositive current in the secondary closed circuit will be decreasing from\r\nm¹, its positive maximum, to zero; but, as the currents are in opposite\r\ndirections, repulsion will occur. These actions of attraction and\r\nrepulsion will be reproduced continually, there being a repulsion, then\r\nan attraction, then a repulsion, and again an attraction, during one\r\ncomplete wave of the primary current. The letters, r, a, at the foot of\r\nthe diagram, Fig. 12, indicate this succession.\r\n\r\nIn reality, however, the effects of self-induction in causing a lag,\r\nshift, or retardation of phase in the secondary current will\r\nconsiderably modify the results, and especially so when the secondary\r\nconductor is constructed so as to give to such self-induction a large\r\nvalue. In other words, the maxima of the primary or inducing current\r\nwill no longer be found coincident with the zero points of the secondary\r\ncurrents. The effect will be the same as if the line representing the\r\nwave of the secondary current in Fig. 12 had been shifted forward to a\r\ngreater or less extent. This is indicated in diagram, Fig. 13. It gives\r\ndoubtless an exaggerated view of the action, though from the effects of\r\nrepulsion which I have produced, I should say it is by no means an\r\nunrealizable condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the period during which the currents are\r\nopposite, and during which repulsion can take place, is lengthened at\r\nthe expense of the period during which the currents are in the same\r\ndirection for attractive action. These differing periods are marked r,\r\na, etc., or the period during which _repulsion_ exists is from the zero\r\nof the primary or inducing current to the succeeding zero of the\r\nsecondary or induced current; and the period during which _attraction_\r\nexists is from the zero of the induced current to the zero of inducing\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nBut far more important still in giving prominence to the repulsive\r\neffect than this difference of effective period is the fact that during\r\nthe period of repulsion both the inducing and induced currents have\r\ntheir greatest values, while during the period of attraction the\r\ncurrents are of small amounts comparatively. This condition may be\r\notherwise expressed by saying that the period during which repulsion\r\noccurs includes all the maxima of current, while the period of\r\nattraction includes no maxima. There is then a _repulsion due to the\r\nsummative effects of strong opposite currents_ for a _lengthened\r\nperiod_, against an _attraction_ due to the summative effects of _weak\r\ncurrents_ of the _same direction_ during a _shortened period_, the\r\nresultant effect being a greatly _preponderating_ repulsion.\r\n\r\nIt is now not difficult to understand all the actions before described\r\nas obtained with the varied relations of coils, magnetic fields, and\r\nclosed circuits. It will be easily understood, also, that an alternating\r\nmagnetic field is in all respects the same as an alternating current\r\ncoil in producing repulsion on the closed conductor, because the\r\nrepulsions between the two conductors are the result of magnetic\r\nrepulsions arising from opposing fields produced by the coils when the\r\ncurrents are of opposite directions in them.\r\n\r\nThus far I have applied the repulsive action described in the\r\nconstruction of alternating current indicators, alternating current arc\r\nlamps, regulating devices for alternating currents, and to rotary motors\r\nfor such currents. For current indicators, a pivoted or suspended copper\r\nband or ring composed of thin washers piled together and insulated from\r\none another, and made to carry a pointer or index has been placed in the\r\naxis of a coil conveying alternating currents whose amount or potential\r\nis to be indicated. Gravity or a spring is used to bring the index to\r\nthe zero of a divided scale, at which time the plane of the copper ring\r\nor band makes an angle of, say, 15 degrees to 20 degrees with the plane\r\nof the coil. This angle is increased by deflection more or less great,\r\naccording to the current traversing the coil. The instrument can be\r\ncalibrated for set conditions of use. Time would not permit of a full\r\ndescription of these arrangements as made up to the present.\r\n\r\nIn arc lamps the magnet for forming the arc can be composed of a closed\r\nconductor, a coil for the passage of current, and an iron wire core. The\r\nrepulsive action upon the closed conductor lifts and regulates the\r\ncarbons in much the same manner that electro magnets do when continuous\r\ncurrents are used. The electro-inductive repulsive action has also been\r\napplied to regulating devices for alternating currents, with the details\r\nof which I cannot now deal.\r\n\r\nFor the construction of an alternating current motor which can be\r\nstarted from a state of rest the principle has also been applied, and it\r\nmay here be remarked that a number of designs of such motors is\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\nOne of the simplest is as follows: The coils, C, Fig. 14, are traversed\r\nby an alternating current and are placed over a coil, B, mounted upon a\r\nhorizontal axis, transverse to the axis of the coil, C. The terminals of\r\nthe coil, B, which is wound with insulated wire, are carried to a\r\ncommutator, the brushes being connected by a wire, as indicated. The\r\ncommutator is so constructed as to keep the coil, B, on short circuit\r\nfrom the position of coincidence with the plane of C to the position\r\nwhere the plane of B is at right angles to that of C; and to keep the\r\ncoil, B, open-circuited from the right-angled position, or thereabouts,\r\nto the position of parallel or coincident planes. The deflective\r\nrepulsion exhibited by B will, when its circuit is completed by the\r\ncommutator and brushes, as described, act to place its plane at right\r\nangles to that of C; but being then open-circuited, its momentum carries\r\nit to the position just past parallelism, at which moment it is again\r\nshort-circuited, and so on. It is capable of very rapid rotation, but\r\nits energy is small. I have, however, extended the principle to the\r\nconstruction of more complete apparatus. One form has its revolving\r\nportion or armature composed of a number of sheet iron disks wound as\r\nusual with three coils crossing near the shaft. The commutator is\r\narranged to short-circuit each of these coils in succession, and twice\r\nin a revolution, and for a period of 90-degrees of rotation each. The\r\nfield coils surround the armature, and there is a laminated iron field\r\nstructure completing the magnetic circuit. I may say here that\r\nsurrounding the armature of a dynamo by the field coils, though very\r\nrecently put forth as a new departure, was described in various\r\nThomson-Houston patents, and to a certain extent all Thomson-Houston\r\nmachines embody this feature.\r\n\r\nFigs. 15 and 16 will give an idea of the construction of the motor\r\nreferred to. CC' are the field coils or inducing coils, which alone are\r\nput into the alternating current circuit. II is a mass of laminated\r\niron, in the interior of which the armature revolves, with its three\r\ncoils, B, B², B³, wound on a core of sheet iron disks. The commutator\r\nshort-circuits the armature coils in succession in the proper positions\r\nto utilize the repulsive effect set up by the currents which are induced\r\nin them by the alternations in the field coils. The motor has no dead\r\npoint, and will start from a state of rest and give out considerable\r\npower, but with what economy is not yet known.\r\n\r\nA curious property of the machine is that at a certain speed, depending\r\non the rapidity of the alternations in the coil, C, a continuous current\r\npasses from one commutator brush to the other, and it will energize\r\nelectro magnets and perform other actions of direct currents. Here we\r\nhave, then, a means of inducing direct currents from alternating\r\ncurrents. To control the speed and keep it at that required for the\r\npurpose, we have only to properly gear the motor to another of the\r\nordinary type for alternating currents, namely, an alternating-current\r\ndynamo used as a motor. The charging of storage batteries would not be\r\ndifficult with such a machine, even from an alternating-current line,\r\nthough the losses might be considerable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHIC STUDY OF STELLAR SPECTRA, HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY.\r\n\r\nHENRY DRAPER MEMORIAL.\r\n\r\n_First Annual Report_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Henry Draper, in 1872, was the first to photograph the lines of a\r\nstellar spectrum. His investigation, pursued for many years with great\r\nskill and ingenuity, was most unfortunately interrupted in 1882 by his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe recent advances in dry-plate photography have vastly increased our\r\npowers of dealing with this subject. Early in 1886, accordingly, Mrs.\r\nDraper made a liberal provision for carrying on this investigation at\r\nthe Harvard College Observatory, as a memorial to her husband. The\r\nresults attained are described below, and show that an opportunity is\r\nopen for a very important and extensive investigation in this branch of\r\nastronomical physics. Mrs. Draper has accordingly decided greatly to\r\nextend the original plan of work, and to have it conducted on a scale\r\nsuited to its importance. The attempt will be made to include all\r\nportions of the subject, so that the final results shall form a complete\r\ndiscussion of the constitution and conditions of the stars, as revealed\r\nby their spectra, so far as present scientific methods permit. It is\r\nhoped that a greater advance will thus be made than if the subject was\r\ndivided among several institutions, or than if a broader range of\r\nastronomical study was attempted.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that a station to be established in the southern\r\nhemisphere will permit the work to be extended so that a similar method\r\nof study may be applied to stars in all parts of the sky. The\r\ninvestigations already undertaken, and described below more in detail,\r\ninclude a catalogue of the spectra of all stars north of--24° of the\r\nsixth magnitude and brighter, a more extensive catalogue of spectra of\r\nstars brighter than the eighth magnitude, and a detailed study of the\r\nspectra of the bright stars.\r\n\r\nThis last will include a classification of the spectra, a determination\r\nof the wave lengths of the lines, a comparison with terrestrial spectra,\r\nand an application of the results to the measurement of the approach and\r\nrecession of the stars. A special photographic investigation will also\r\nbe undertaken of the spectra of the banded stars, and of the ends of the\r\nspectra of the bright stars.\r\n\r\nThe instruments employed are an eight inch Voigtlander photographic\r\nlens, reground by Alvan Clark & Sons, and Dr. Draper's 11 inch\r\nphotographic lens, for which Mrs. Draper has provided a new mounting and\r\nobservatory. The 15 inch refractor belonging to the Harvard College\r\nObservatory has also been employed in various experiments with a slit\r\nspectroscope, and is again being used as described below. Mrs. Draper\r\nhas decided to send to Cambridge a 28 inch reflector and its mountings,\r\nand a 15 inch mirror, which is one of the most perfect reflectors\r\nconstructed by Dr. Draper, and with which his photograph of the moon was\r\ntaken. The first two instruments mentioned above have been kept at work\r\nduring the first part of every clear night for several months. It is now\r\nintended that at least three telescopes shall be used during the whole\r\nnight, until the work is interrupted by daylight.\r\n\r\nThe spectra have been produced by placing in front of the telescope a\r\nlarge prism, thus returning to the method originally employed by\r\nFraunhofer in the first study of stellar spectra. Four 15° prisms have\r\nbeen constructed, the three largest having clear apertures of nearly\r\neleven inches, and the fourth being somewhat smaller. The entire weight\r\nof these prisms exceeds a hundred pounds, and they fill a brass cubical\r\nbox a foot on each side. The spectrum of a star formed by this apparatus\r\nis extremely narrow when the telescope is driven by clockwork in the\r\nusual way. A motion is accordingly given to the telescope slightly\r\ndiffering from that of the earth by means of a secondary clock\r\ncontrolling it electrically. The spectrum is thus spread into a band,\r\nhaving a width proportional to the time of exposure and to the rate of\r\nthe controlling clock.\r\n\r\nThis band is generally not uniformly dense. It exhibits lines\r\nperpendicular to the refracting edge of the prism, such as are produced\r\nin the field of an ordinary spectroscope by particles of dust upon the\r\nslit. In the present case, these lines may be due to variations in the\r\ntransparency of the air during the time of exposure, or to instrumental\r\ncauses, such as irregular running of the driving clock, or slight\r\nchanges in the motion of the telescope, resulting from the manner in\r\nwhich its polar axis is supported.\r\n\r\nThese instrumental defects may be too small to be detected in ordinary\r\nmicrometric or photographic observations, and still sufficient to affect\r\nthe photographs just described.\r\n\r\nA method of enlargement has been tried which gives very satisfactory\r\nresults, and removes the lines above mentioned as defects in the\r\nnegatives. A cylindrical lens is placed close to the enlarging lens,\r\nwith its axis parallel to the length of the spectrum. In the apparatus\r\nactually employed, the length of the spectrum, and with it the\r\ndispersion, is increased five times, while the breadth is made in all\r\ncases about four inches. The advantage of this arrangement is that it\r\ngreatly reduces the difficulty arising from the feeble light of the\r\nstar. Until very lately, the spectra in the original negatives were made\r\nvery narrow, since otherwise the intensity of the starlight would have\r\nbeen insufficient to produce the proper decomposition of the silver\r\nparticles. The enlargement being made by daylight, the vast amount of\r\nenergy then available is controlled by the original negative, the action\r\nof which may be compared to that of a telegraphic relay. The copies\r\ntherefore represent many hundred times the original energy received from\r\nthe stars. If care is not taken, the dust and irregularities of the film\r\nwill give trouble, each foreign particle appearing as a fine spectral\r\nline.\r\n\r\nOur methods of enlargement have been considered, and some of them tried,\r\nwith the object of removing the irregularities of the original spectra\r\nwithout introducing new defects. For instance, the sensitive plate may\r\nbe moved during the enlargement in the direction of the spectral lines;\r\na slit parallel to the lines may be used as the source of light, and the\r\noriginal negative separated by a small interval from the plate used for\r\nthe copy; or two cylindrical lenses may be used, with their axes\r\nperpendicular to each other. In some of these ways the lines due to dust\r\nmight either be avoided or so much reduced in length as not to resemble\r\nthe true lines of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe 15 inch refractor is now being used with a modification of the\r\napparatus employed by Dr. Draper in his first experiments--a slit\r\nspectroscope from which the slit has been removed. A concave lens has\r\nbeen substituted for the collimator and slit, and besides other\r\nadvantages, a great saving in length is secured by this change. It is\r\nproposed to apply this method to the 28 inch reflector, thus utilizing\r\nits great power of gathering light.\r\n\r\n[A description of an accompanying plate here follows, which is omitted,\r\nas the plate cannot be easily reproduced for ordinary press printing.]\r\n\r\nThe results to be derived from the large number of photographs already\r\nobtained can only be stated after a long series of measurements and a\r\ncareful reduction and discussion of them. An inspection of the plates,\r\nhowever, shows some points of interest. A photograph of _a Cygni_, taken\r\nNovember, 26, 1886, shows that the H line is double, its two components\r\nhaving a difference in wave length of about one ten-millionth of a\r\nmillimeter. A photograph of _o Ceti_ shows that the lines G and _h_ are\r\nbright, as are also four of the ultra-violet lines characteristic of\r\nspectra of the first type. The H and K lines in this spectrum are dark,\r\nshowing that they probably do not belong to that series of lines. The\r\nstar near _[chi]' Orionis_, discovered by Gore, in December, 1885, gives\r\na similar spectrum, which affords additional evidence that it is a\r\nvariable of the same class as _o Ceti_. Spectra of _Sirius_ show a large\r\nnumber of faint lines besides the well-known broad lines.\r\n\r\nThe dispersion employed in any normal map of the spectrum may be\r\nexpressed by its scale, that is, by the ratio of the wave length as\r\nrepresented to the actual wave length. It will be more convenient to\r\ndivide these ratios by one million, to avoid the large numbers otherwise\r\ninvolved. If one millionth of a millimeter is taken as the unit of wave\r\nlength, the length of this unit on the map in millimeters will give the\r\nsame measure of the dispersion as that just described. When the map is\r\nnot normal, the dispersion of course varies in different parts. It\r\nincreases rapidly toward the violet end when the spectrum is formed by a\r\nprism. Accordingly, in this case the dispersion given will be that of\r\nthe point whose wave length is 400.\r\n\r\nThis point lies near the middle of the photographic spectrum when a\r\nprism is used, and is not far from the H line. The dispersion may\r\naccordingly be found with sufficient accuracy by measuring the interval\r\nbetween the H and K lines, and dividing the result in millimeters by\r\n3.4, since the difference in their wave lengths equals this quantity.\r\nThe following examples serve to illustrate the dispersion expressed in\r\nthis way: Angstrom, Cornu, 10; Draper, photographer of normal solar\r\nspectrum, 3.1 and 5.2; Rowland, 23, 33, and 46; Draper, stellar spectra,\r\n0.16; Huggins, 0.1.\r\n\r\nThe most rapid plates are needed in this work, other considerations\r\nbeing generally of less importance. Accordingly, the Allen and Rowell\r\nextra quick plates have been used until recently. It was found, however,\r\nthat they were surpassed by the Seed plates No. 21, which were\r\naccordingly substituted for them early in December. Recognizing the\r\nimportance of supplying this demand for the most sensitive plates\r\npossible, the Seed Company have recently succeeded in making still more\r\nsensitive plates, which we are now using. The limit does not seem to be\r\nreached even yet. Plates could easily be handled if the sensitiveness\r\nwere increased tenfold. A vast increase in the results may be\r\nanticipated with each improvement of the plates in this respect.\r\nApparatus for testing plates, which is believed to be much more accurate\r\nthan that ordinarily employed, is in course of preparation. It is\r\nexpected that a very precise determination will be made of the rapidity\r\nof the plates employed. Makers of very rapid plates are invited to send\r\nspecimens for trial.\r\n\r\nThe photographic work has been done by Mr. W.P. Gerrish, who has also\r\nrendered important assistance in other parts of the investigation. He\r\nhas shown great skill in various experiments which have been tried, and\r\nin the use of various novel and delicate instruments. Many of the\r\nexperimental difficulties could not have been overcome but for the\r\nuntiring skill and perseverance of Mr. George B. Clark, of the firm of\r\nAlvan Clark & Sons, by whom all the large instruments have been\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the various investigations which are to form a part of\r\nthis work is given below:\r\n\r\n1. _Catalogue of Spectra of Bright Stars_.--This is a continuation of\r\nthe work undertaken with the aid of an appropriation from the Bache\r\nfund, and described in the Memoirs of the American Academy, vol. xi., p.\r\n210. The 8 inch telescope is used, each photograph covering a region of\r\n10° square. The exposures for equatorial stars last for five minutes,\r\nand the rate of the clock is such that the spectra have a width of about\r\n0.1 cm. The length of the spectra is about 1.2 cm. for the brighter, and\r\n0.6 cm. for the fainter stars. The dispersion of the scale proposed\r\nabove is 0.1.\r\n\r\nThe spectra of all stars of the sixth magnitude and brighter will\r\ngenerally be found upon these plates, except in the case of red stars.\r\nMany fainter blue stars also appear. Three or four exposures are made\r\nupon a single plate. The entire sky north of -24° would be covered\r\ntwice, according to this plan, with 180 plates and 690 exposures. It is\r\nfound preferable in some cases to make only two exposures; and when the\r\nplate appears to be a poor one, the work is repeated. The number of\r\nplates is therefore increased. Last summer the plates appeared to be\r\ngiving poor results. Dust on the prisms seemed to be the explanation of\r\nthis difficulty. Many regions were reobserved on this account. The first\r\ncycle, covering the entire sky from zero to twenty-four hours of right\r\nascension, has been completed.\r\n\r\nThe work will be finished during the coming year by a second cycle of\r\nobservations, which has already been begun. The first cycle contains 257\r\nplates, all of which have been measured, and a large part of the\r\nreduction completed. 8,313 spectra have been measured on them, nearly\r\nall of which have been identified, and the places of a greater portion\r\nof the stars brought forward to the year 1900, and entered in catalogue\r\nform. In the second cycle, 64 plates have been taken, and about as many\r\nmore will be required. 51 plates have been measured and identified,\r\nincluding 2,974 spectra. A study of the photographic brightness and\r\ndistribution of the light in the spectra will also be made.\r\n\r\nThe results will be published in the form of a catalogue resembling the\r\nPhotometric Catalogue given in volume xiv. of the Annals of Harvard\r\nCollege Observatory. It will contain the approximate place of each star\r\nfor 1900, its designation, the character of the spectrum as derived from\r\neach of the plates in which it was photographed, the references to these\r\nplates, and the photographic brightness of the star.\r\n\r\n2. _Catalogue of Spectra of Faint Stars_.--This work resembles the\r\npreceding, but is much more extensive. The same instrument is used, but\r\neach region has an exposure of an hour, the rate of the clock being such\r\nthat the width of the spectrum will be as before 0.1 cm. Many stars of\r\nthe ninth magnitude will thus be included, and nearly all brighter than\r\nthe eighth. In one case, over three hundred spectra are shown on a\r\nsingle plate. This work has been carried on only in the intervals when\r\nthe telescope was not needed for other purposes. 99 plates have,\r\nhowever, been obtained, and on these 4,442 spectra have been measured.\r\nIt is proposed to complete the equatorial zones first, gradually\r\nextending the work northward. In all, 15,729 spectra of bright and faint\r\nstars have been measured.\r\n\r\n3. _Detailed Study of the Spectra of the Brighter Stars_.--This work has\r\nbeen carried on with the 11 inch photographic telescope used by Dr.\r\nDraper in his later researches. A wooden observatory was constructed\r\nabout 20 feet square. This was surmounted by a dome having a clear\r\ndiameter of 18 feet on the inside. The dome had a wooden frame, sheathed\r\nand covered with canvas. It rested on eight cast iron wheels, and was\r\neasily moved by hand, the power being directly applied. Work was begun\r\nupon it in June, and the first observations were made with the telescope\r\nin October.\r\n\r\nTwo prisms were formed by splitting a thick plate of glass diagonally.\r\nThese gave such good results that two others were made in the same way,\r\nand the entire battery of four prisms is ordinarily used. The safety and\r\nconvenience of handling the prisms is greatly increased by placing them\r\nin square brass boxes, each of which slides into place like a drawer.\r\nAny combination of the prisms may thus be employed. As is usual in such\r\nan investigation, a great variety of difficulties have been encountered,\r\nand the most important of them have now been overcome.\r\n\r\n4. _Faint Stellar Spectra_.--The 28 inch reflector will be used for the\r\nstudy of the spectra of the faint stars, and also for the fainter\r\nportions near the ends of the spectra of the brighter stars. The form of\r\nspectroscope mentioned above, in which the collimator and slit are\r\nreplaced by a concave lens, will be tried. The objects to be examined\r\nare, first, the stars known to be variable, with the expectation that\r\nsome evidence may be afforded of the cause of the variation. The stars\r\nwhose spectrum is known to be banded, to contain bright lines, or to be\r\npeculiar in other respects, will also be examined systematically.\r\nExperiments will also be tried with orthochromatic plates and the use of\r\na colored absorbing medium, in order to photograph the red portions of\r\nthe spectra of the bright stars. Quartz will also be tried to extend the\r\nimages toward the ultra-violet.\r\n\r\n5. _Absorption Spectra_.--The ordinary form of comparison spectrum\r\ncannot be employed on account of the absence of a slit. The most\r\npromising method of determining the wave lengths of the stellar spectra\r\nis to interpose some absorbent medium. Experiments are in progress with\r\nhyponitric fumes and other substances. A tank containing one of these\r\nmaterials is interposed and the spectra photographed through it. The\r\nstellar spectra will then be traversed by lines resulting from the\r\nabsorption of the media thus interposed, and, after their wave lengths\r\nare once determined, they serve as a precise standard to which the\r\nstellar lines may be referred. The absorption lines of the terrestrial\r\natmosphere would form the best standard for this purpose if those which\r\nare sufficiently fine can be photographed.\r\n\r\n6. _Wave Lengths_.--The determination of the wave lengths of the lines\r\nin the stellar spectra will form an important part of the work which has\r\nnot yet been begun. The approximate wave lengths can readily be found\r\nfrom a comparison with the solar spectrum, a sufficient number of solar\r\nlines being present in most stellar spectra. If, then, satisfactory\r\nresults are obtained in the preceding investigation, the motion of the\r\nstars can probably be determined with a high degree of precision. The\r\nidentification of the lines with those of terrestrial substances will of\r\ncourse form a part of the work, but the details will be considered\r\nsubsequently.\r\n\r\nFrom the above statement it will be seen that photographic apparatus has\r\nbeen furnished on a scale unequaled elsewhere. But what is more\r\nimportant, Mrs. Draper has not only provided the means for keeping these\r\ninstruments actively employed, several of them during the whole of every\r\nclear night, but also of reducing the results by a considerable force of\r\ncomputers, and of publishing them in a suitable form. A field of work of\r\ngreat extent and promise is open, and there seems to be an opportunity\r\nto erect to the name of Dr. Henry Draper a memorial such as heretofore\r\nno astronomer has received. One cannot but hope that such an example may\r\nbe imitated in other departments of astronomy, and that hereafter other\r\nnames may be commemorated, not by a needless duplication of unsupported\r\nobservatories, but by the more lasting monuments of useful work\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nEDWARD C.

This colt, by Hampton out of Doll\r\nTear-sheet, was one of Mr. Crowther Harrison's draught of yearlings sent\r\nup to the Doncaster sales in 1885, and fell to the bid of Mr. T. Spence,\r\nacting for Mr. Abingdon, for 3,100 guineas. The Oaks, on May 27, was won\r\nby a daughter of the same sire. Merry Hampton is to compete for the\r\nGrand Prize of Paris and for the St. Leger. He has also liabilities in\r\nthe Thirty-ninth Triennial and Grand Duke Michael stakes at Newmarket,\r\nFirst October; Newmarket Derby at the Second October; Ascot Derby and\r\nTwenty-fifth New Biennial; Drawing-room stakes at Goodwood; Great\r\nInternational Breeders' Foal stakes at Kempton Park, August; North Derby\r\nat Newcastle, Summer; St. George stakes at Liverpool, July; Bickerstaffe\r\nstakes and St. Leger at Liverpool, August; Midland Derby stakes at\r\nLeicester, July; and Ebor St. Leger at York, August; in addition to the\r\nfollowing races in 1888: Champion stakes at Newmarket, Second October;\r\nRous Memorial and Hardwicke stakes at Ascot, and Eclipse stakes at\r\nSandown Park, Second Summer. Merry Hampton's name also appears in the\r\nKempton Park Royal stakes of 10,000 sovereigns at the Spring Meeting of\r\n1889.--_Ill. London News_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MERRY HAMPTON.

Each of these cataracts differs in type of flow.\r\n\r\nThe \"Rajah,\" eight hundred and thirty feet, and at a breadth of\r\nfifty-six, shoots silent and sheer over an uplifted lip of rock in the\r\nbed of the stream, casting a dark shadow behind him when faced by the\r\nsun; the \"Roarer\" makes noise enough in its headlong rush to vibrate the\r\nstrong, stone-built travelers' bungalow on the heights above; the\r\n\"Rocket\" is straight in descent, and, as a commentator has already\r\nremarked, as much like a rocket as anything else; and \"La Dame Blanche,\"\r\na triptych of rhythmical flow, spreads a dainty, silky, sheen of white,\r\nwhispering, glistening, softly falling water over a slightly shelving\r\nwidth of rock, touched here and there with prismatic color and strong\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FALLS OF GAIRSOPPA, BETWEEN KANARA AND MYSORE, BOMBAY\r\nPRESIDENCY, INDIA\r\n\r\nThe Falls From Below. The Falls From Above.]\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the chasm, seven hundred feet across, and stretching\r\nover a muddy, turbulent, seething cauldron of spray, a brilliantly\r\ndistinct rainbow in the full light of day may be seen with its scarcely\r\nless glorious reflection, dazzlingly beautiful.\r\n\r\nIn these regions 210 inches of rain is an average downpour for the\r\nmonsoon between May and October, the heaviest fall being generally in\r\nJuly. The cataracts then become frequently confluent, though not more\r\npicturesque. They are then too difficult of access, and the whole\r\ndistrict is very malarious. December and January are the best months for\r\ntravelers, before the dry season fairly sets in again, during which\r\nthere is but little water, even insufficient to form four distinct\r\nfalls.\r\n\r\nThe best route to them is from Bombay to Honaurre by sea, _via_ Kawai,\r\nand on to Old Gairsoppa by river boat and palanquin to the \"Jog,\" as the\r\nspecial points of interest (the \"Falls\") are called by the Kanarese.\r\n\r\nTo the enthusiastic shikari, however, the way from Hubli (on the\r\nSouthern Mahratta Railway, easily reached by G.I.P. line from Bombay),\r\ntaking him, as it does, through the very happiest hunting grounds of the\r\npresidency, where all game, small and large, abounds, will have\r\nattraction enough; and at Giddapur, the last stage, within twelve miles\r\nof the Falls, there is a courteous English-speaking native magistrate,\r\nwilling and able to help the traveler on his way.

Von Ledenfeld lately delivered a lecture at the\r\nRoyal Institution, upon \"Recent Additions to our Knowledge of Sponges.\"\r\nThe lecturer did not confine himself to the sponges of Australia alone,\r\nbut gave a _resume_ of the results of recent investigations on sponges,\r\ntogether with several new interesting details observed more especially\r\nin studying the growth of Australian sponges. With a passing reference\r\nto some peculiarities of the lower marine animals of the Australian\r\ncoast, Dr. Ledenfeld remarked upon the preponderance of sponges over\r\nother forms of marine life in that part of the world. It has long been a\r\npoint of discussion as to whether sponges belong to the vegetable or\r\nanimal kingdom, but naturalists are now generally agreed in regarding\r\nthem as animals, a conclusion, the lecturer remarked, that Aristotle had\r\nalso arrived at.\r\n\r\nSponges grow in a variety of more or less irregular shapes, but it has\r\nbeen observed that the most regular structures occur in the calcareous\r\nspecies. As to color, Dr. Ledenfeld remarked that some of the Australian\r\nsponges are of exceptionally brilliant hues, while others range from the\r\nblack of the common sponge _(Euspongia officinalis)_ to a pure white.\r\nAlso, it may be remarked, the sponges growing in deep water are of less\r\ndecided color and more elastic in character than those living in shallow\r\nwater, and from the last named quality are more valuable in commerce.\r\nThe irregular honeycombed appearance of the sponge is due to a most\r\ncomplicated canal system, consisting of a series of chambers through\r\nwhich the water is drawn by the animal in always the same direction.\r\n\r\nThe inhalent pores are very minute, and open into small subdermal\r\ncavities which communicate by means of interradial tubes with the\r\nciliated chambers, the latter being very small ramifications of the\r\ninterradial channels, and in them the movement causing the current of\r\nwater is maintained. From hence all faecal and other matter is\r\ndischarged through the oscula, the larger openings observed on the\r\nsurface of the sponge. Dr. Ledenfeld showed the different parts of\r\nsponges by means of microscopic slides thrown on to a screen, and also\r\nthe shape and arrangement of the chambers in different species. The\r\nciliated chambers especially attracted attention. They are very small\r\nand circular, and the interior is clothed with cells very similar to the\r\ncilia cells in higher animal life.\r\n\r\nThese cells are arranged around the ciliated chambers in the form of a\r\ncollar, and from each cell flagella protrude, which are in continual\r\nmotion. These flagella, like bats' wings, are capable of being bent in\r\nonly one direction, so that, in the course of their pendulum-like\r\nmotion, in the movement one way the flagella are bent, while in the\r\nreturn movement they remain stiff, thus causing a current of water\r\nalways flowing in one and the same direction. These ciliated chambers\r\nare easily detected in the sponge by means of a microscope, as they\r\nappear more highly colored. After the lecturer had thus given a general\r\noutline of the structure of the sponge, he drew attention to the\r\ncharacter of its food and its method of digestion. It is not known\r\nexactly what the sponge lives upon, but if upon other animals they must\r\nbe necessarily very small, owing to the size of its inhalent pores.\r\n\r\nThe sponge, like the tape-worm, has no stomach, but must absorb its food\r\nthrough the outer skin from matter in a soluble state, similarly to the\r\nroots of trees. This process of absorption is probably accomplished in\r\nthe interradial or ciliated chambers, more probably in the former, as\r\nthe latter are generally considered excretory in function. Lime or\r\nsilica must also be absorbed from the water by most sponges in order to\r\nmake up the skeleton. The skeleton of calcareous sponges consists of a\r\nnumber of spicules composed of carbonate of lime. These spicules are of\r\nvery varied though regular shape, but ordinarily assume a rod-like\r\nneedle shape or else a stellate form. In silicious sponges the spicules\r\nare composed of silica, and are generally deposited around axial rods in\r\nconcentric layers. The spicules are joined together and cemented by a\r\nbody that has been named \"spongin,\" which has much the same chemical\r\ncomposition as silk, and, like silk, is very elastic. In some varieties\r\nof sponges, especially in the kinds which come into the market, the\r\nskeleton is almost entirely composed of fibers of pure \"spongin.\" These\r\nfibers are so close together as to draw up water by capillary action,\r\nand, indeed, a great deal in the value of a sponge depends upon the\r\nfineness and tenuity of these fibers.\r\n\r\nDr. Ledenfeld again illustrated this stage of his lecture by means of a\r\nnumber of microscopic slides in which the variety of shape and size of\r\nthese spicules and \"spongin\" fibers were shown. The spicules are some\r\ncrutch-like, others spined or echinated, while the deep-sea sponges\r\nappear to grow long thick spicules, which attach the sponge to the\r\nground by means of grapnel-like ends. In some cases the skeleton seems\r\nto be more or less replaced by sand, the small grains of which are\r\ncemented together by the \"spongin.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Ledenfeld then drew attention to the presence of more highly\r\ndeveloped organs in the sponge. Muscles pervade the whole tissue of the\r\nsponge, but are found more particularly in the superficial parts. One\r\nset of muscles affect the size of the inhalent pores, causing them to\r\ncontract or expand, while another set are able to close the pores\r\naltogether, thus acting as a protection from the attack of an enemy. All\r\nthese muscles are composed of spindle shaped cells, which are capable of\r\nspasmodic motion, but recently in an Australian sponge, the _Euspongia\r\ncanalicula_, the lecturer said he had observed muscles approaching very\r\nnearly in character those of the human frame.\r\n\r\nThat sponges have nerves is a discovery of recent date by a member of\r\nthe Royal Microscopical Society. Dr. Ledenfeld also about the same time\r\nfound indications of the presence of a nervous system, but the form in\r\nwhich he observed the nerves at first apparently differed from those\r\nobserved simultaneously. This difference, however, he afterward found to\r\nbe due to the manner in which the section had been prepared for\r\nobservation. The nerves consist of two cells at the base of a cone-like\r\nprojection on the epidermis, and from each cell a fiber runs to the\r\npoint of the cone, besides several others connecting them with the\r\ninterior of the sponge.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that here again Aristotle has predicted that sponges\r\nhave a nervous system, basing his statement on the fact that ancient\r\nGreek mariners foretold storms by the alleged contraction of the sponge.\r\nThe reproductive organs of sponges are also very highly developed, and\r\nboth ova and spermatozoa are found throughout the sponge, though more\r\nconcentrated in the interior. The ova consist of spherical cells, while\r\nthe spermatozoa resemble an arrow-head in shape. It has not yet been\r\nascertained whether two sexes exist in sponges, or whether the ova and\r\nspermatozoa are produced at different periods by the same sponge. When\r\nthe embryo has become partly developed, it detaches itself from the\r\nparent sponge, and, issuing from the oscula, propels itself through the\r\nwater by means of a number of flagella.\r\n\r\nSilicious spicules next appear in its structure, and it then attaches\r\nitself to a rock and assumes its mature form. Sponges are most numerous\r\nin the waters of the temperate and sub-tropical zones, and the\r\nsalt-water varieties are by far more numerous than the fresh water.\r\nThus, while there are not more than ten fresh-water species known, Dr.\r\nLedenfeld remarked that about one thousand species of salt-water sponges\r\nhad been recognized. Each species of the salt-water sponge is, however,\r\ngenerally found only in limited areas, and very few, all of which\r\ninhabit deep water, are cosmopolitan. This is the more remarkable as Dr.\r\nLedenfeld asserts that all the sponges inhabiting the rivers of\r\nAustralia are identical with the fresh-water sponges of Europe, and in\r\norder to explain this fact he put forward a rather interesting theory.\r\nHe assumes that sponge life in rivers has been originally generated by\r\nthe introduction of a single, or at most two or three germs by means of\r\naquatic birds. The inbreeding consequent upon this paucity of sponge\r\nlife has produced a certain fixity of character in fresh-water sponges,\r\nand is in direct opposition to the effects of hybridization in the\r\nsalt-water sponges, by which they have acquired the capacity of adapting\r\nthemselves to local circumstances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBET'S TEPID DOUCHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeeping the body clean is indispensable for the preservation of good\r\nhealth, through obtaining an operation of the skin and expelling matter\r\nwhose presence aids in the development of diseases. It is unfortunately\r\nnecessary to say that, considering the population as a whole, the\r\nproportion of those who take baths is very small. This is due to the\r\nfact that the habit of cleanliness, which should become a necessity, has\r\nnot been early inculcated in every individual; and the reason that this\r\ncomplement to education is not realized is because the means of\r\nsatisfying its exigencies are usually wanting.\r\n\r\nWe shall not speak of the improved processes that are used solely by the\r\nrich or well-to-do, as these become impracticable where it is a question\r\nof the working classes or of large masses of individuals. It is, in\r\nfact, the last named category that interests us, and we are convinced\r\nthat if we get young soldiers and children to hold dirtiness in horror,\r\nwe shall be sure that they will later on take care of their bodies\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe most tempting solution of this question of washing seems to be found\r\nin the use of large pools of running tepid water; but such a process is\r\ntoo costly for general use, and the most economical one, without doubt,\r\nconsists in giving tepid douches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEPID WATER DOUCHE]\r\n\r\nTo our knowledge, the only apparatus in this line that has been devised\r\nwas exhibited last year at the exhibition of hygiene in the Loban\r\nbarracks. It has been used daily for six years in several garrisons, and\r\ntherefore has the sanction of practice.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus, which is due to Mr. Herbet, consists of a steam boiler\r\nand of an ejector fixed to a reservoir of water and provided with a\r\nrubber tube to which a nozzle is attached. The steam generated in the\r\nboiler passes into the ejector, sucks up the water and forces it out in\r\na tepid state.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus thus established did not sufficiently fulfill the purpose\r\nfor which it was designed. It was necessary to have a means of varying\r\nthe temperature of the water projected, according to the season and\r\ntemperature of the air, to have an instantaneous and simple method of\r\nregulating the apparatus, that could be understood by any operator, and\r\nto have the apparatus under the control of the person holding the\r\nnozzle. These difficulties have been solved very simply by causing the\r\norifice of the nozzle to vary. This nozzle, from whence the jet escapes,\r\nis formed of rings that screw together. When the nozzle is entire, the\r\njet escapes at a temperature of say 40°. When the first ring is\r\nunscrewed, the water will make its exit at a temperature of 38°. In\r\norder to lower the temperature still further, it is only necessary to\r\nunscrew the other rings in succession, until the desired temperature has\r\nbeen obtained.\r\n\r\nAs it is, the apparatus is rendering great services where it has been\r\nintroduced; for example, at Besancon and Belfort. It serves, in fact,\r\nfor an entire garrison, while that before, the washing was done in each\r\nregiment, thus requiring the use of much space and causing much loss of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nEight men are washed at once for five minutes, say 96 men per hour.\r\nEvery minute the men turn right about face, and when they are in file\r\neach rubs the other's back.\r\n\r\nTwenty-two pounds of coal and 260 gallons of water are consumed per\r\nhour, and the boiler produces 130 lb. of steam.--_Le Genie Civil_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A STAR FINDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing all of wood, it is easily made by any one who can use a few tools,\r\nthe only bit of lathe work necessary being the turned shoulder, K, of\r\npolar axis. A is the baseboard, 9 in. by 5 in., near each corner of\r\nwhich is inserted an ordinary wood screw, S S, for the purpose of\r\nleveling the base, to which two side pieces are nailed, having the\r\nangle, _x_, equal to the co-latitude of the place. On to these side\r\npieces is fastened another board, on which is marked the hour circle, F.\r\nThrough this board passes the lower end of the polar axis, having a\r\nshoulder turned up on it at K, and is secured by a wooden collar and pin\r\nunderneath. On to the upper part of the polar axis is fastened the\r\ndeclination circle, C, 5½ in. diameter, made of ¼ in. baywood, having\r\nthe outer rim of a thin compass card divided into degrees pasted on to\r\nit. The hour circle, F, is half of a similar card, with the hours\r\npainted underneath, and divided to 20 minutes. G is the hour index. D is\r\na straight wooden pointer, 12 in. long, having a piece of brass tube, E,\r\nattached, and a small opening at J, into which is fixed the point of a\r\ncommon pin by which to set the pointer in declination. H is a nut to\r\nclamp pointer in position.
