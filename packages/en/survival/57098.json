He\r\nwas throughout his long life a diligent and miscellaneous collector,\r\nhaving, as stated in the Preamble of the Act of Incorporation of the\r\nMuseum, “through the course of many years, with great labour and\r\nexpense, gathered together whatever could be procured, either in our\r\nown or foreign countries, that was rare and curious.” His collection,\r\nwhich at the time of his death in 1753 was contained in his residence,\r\nthe Manor House, Chelsea, consisted of “Books, Manuscripts, Prints,\r\nMedals, and Coins, ancient and modern, Seals, Cameos and Intaglios,\r\nPrecious Stones, Agates, Jaspers, Vessels of Agate and Jasper,\r\nCrystals, Mathematical Instruments, Drawings, and Pictures,” and\r\nincluded numerous zoological and geological specimens, as well as\r\nan extensive herbarium of dried plants preserved in 333 large folio\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nAccording to the terms of Sir Hans Sloane’s will, this collection was\r\npurchased for the sum of £20,000--far below its intrinsic value--in\r\norder “that it might be preserved and maintained, not only for the\r\ninspection and entertainment of the learned and the curious, but for\r\nthe general use and benefit of the public to all posterity.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Montagu House, Bloomsbury.]\r\n\r\nThe valuable collection of manuscripts formed by Sir Robert Cotton at\r\nthe end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth centuries\r\nwas already the property of the nation, having been presented by his\r\ngrandson, Sir John Cotton, in the year 1700. The Harley Collection was\r\nobtained by purchase at the same time as the Sloane, and the three\r\nwere brought together under the designation of “the British Museum,”\r\nplaced under the care of a body of Trustees,[1] and lodged in Montagu\r\nHouse, Bloomsbury, purchased for their reception in 1754. The Museum\r\nwas opened to the public on the 15th of January, 1759. Admission to\r\nthe galleries of antiquities and natural history was at first by\r\nticket only after application in writing, and limited to ten persons,\r\nfor three hours in the day. Instead of being allowed to inspect the\r\ncases at their leisure, visitors were conducted through the galleries\r\nby officers of the house. The hours of admission were subsequently\r\nextended; but it was not until the year 1810 that the Museum was freely\r\naccessible to the general public for three days in the week, from ten\r\nto four o’clock. The daily opening, with longer hours in summer, dates\r\nfrom 1879.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Growth of Collections necessitating additional space.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Resolution to separate Natural History Collection.]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the foundation of the Museum, the site allotted seemed\r\namply sufficient for its purposes; but gradually, as the collections\r\nincreased, they outgrew the limits, not only of the original Montagu\r\nHouse, but even of its successor, the present classical building,\r\ncompleted in 1845 from the designs of Sir Robert Smirke. The erection\r\nof the magnificent reading-room in 1857 disposed for a time of the\r\ndifficulty of finding accommodation for the ever-growing library; but\r\nthe keepers of other departments continued urgent in their demands\r\nfor more space, and after much discussion of rival plans for keeping\r\nthe collections together and obtaining the needful extension of room\r\nby acquiring the property immediately around the old Museum, or for\r\nsevering the collections and removing a portion to another building,\r\nthe latter course was finally decided upon. At a special general\r\nmeeting of the Trustees, held on the 21st of January, 1860, attended\r\nby many members of the Government in their official capacity, a\r\nresolution, moved by the First Lord of the Treasury, was carried “That\r\nit is expedient that the Natural History Collection be removed from\r\nthe British Museum, inasmuch as such an arrangement would be attended\r\nwith considerably less expense than would be incurred by providing a\r\nsufficient additional space in immediate contiguity to the present\r\nbuilding of the British Museum.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Purchase of a Site at South Kensington.]\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons, in the Session of 1863, sanctioned the purchase\r\nof part of the site of the International Exhibition of 1862 at South\r\nKensington, with a view to appropriating it to the purpose of a Museum\r\nof Natural History.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Competitive designs.]\r\n\r\nIn January, 1864, the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Works issued an\r\nadvertisement for designs for a Natural History Museum and a Patent\r\nMuseum, to be erected on part of the land thus acquired; a plan which\r\nhad been prepared by Mr. Hunt in September, 1862, from Sir Richard\r\nOwen’s suggestions, being proposed as a model in respect to dimensions\r\nand internal arrangement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Captain Fowke’s plan.]\r\n\r\nThe plans of the various competitors were submitted to Her Majesty’s\r\nCommissioners of Works, who awarded prizes to three of the number,\r\ngiving precedence to that of Captain Francis Fowke, R.E., and then\r\nreferred the three selected plans to the Trustees of the British\r\nMuseum. As the internal arrangements in Captain Fowke’s plan did not\r\nmeet with the approval of the Museum officers, he was desired to modify\r\nthem in conformity with the requirements of the Trustees, and was\r\nengaged in this labour when his death occurred, in September, 1865.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Waterhouse engaged.]\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1866, Mr. Alfred Waterhouse was invited by the Chief\r\nCommissioner of Works to take up the unfinished work of Captain Fowke,\r\nbut found himself unable to complete the plan to his own satisfaction.\r\nIn February, 1868, he was accordingly commissioned to form a fresh\r\ndesign, embodying the requirements of the officers of the Natural\r\nHistory Departments of the Museum.\r\n\r\nMr. Waterhouse was not long in submitting to the Trustees his plan and\r\nmodel of the building, with a disposition of galleries as required,\r\nand these were formally accepted by the Trustees in April, 1868. It\r\nwas not, however, until February 1871 that the working plans had been\r\nthoroughly considered, and had received the final approval of the\r\nTrustees.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Completion of building and removal of Collections.]\r\n\r\nThe actual work of erection commenced in the year 1873, and the\r\nbuilding was handed over to the Trustees of the British Museum by Her\r\nMajesty’s Commissioners of Works in the month of June, 1880. As soon as\r\nthe exhibition-cases were completed, and the galleries sufficiently dry\r\nto receive the collections, the labour of removing the Natural History\r\nCollection from Bloomsbury was begun. The departments of Geology,\r\nMineralogy, and Botany were arranged in their respective sections of\r\nthe Museum in the course of the year 1880, and the portion of the\r\nMuseum which contained these departments was first opened to the public\r\non April 18th, 1881. It was not until the following year that the cases\r\ndestined to receive the larger collections of the Zoological Department\r\nwere sufficiently near completion to allow of these collections\r\nfollowing, and three more years were required before all the galleries\r\ncould be brought into a state fitted for public exhibition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Description of the building.]\r\n\r\nThe following description of the structure was contributed by Mr.\r\nWaterhouse:--\r\n\r\n“The New Natural History Museum will, from its position, always be more\r\nor less identified with the International Exhibition of 1862, which\r\noccupied the whole of the site between the Horticultural Gardens and\r\nCromwell Road. It was at one time thought that a portion, at any rate,\r\nof the Exhibition buildings could with advantage have been converted\r\ninto a Museum of Natural History. Parliament, however, decided against\r\nthe preservation of any part of these buildings, and they were\r\naccordingly entirely removed.\r\n\r\n“In designing the present building, Captain Fowke’s original idea of\r\nemploying terra-cotta was always kept in view, though the blocks were\r\nreduced in size, so as to obviate, as far as possible, the objection to\r\nthe employment of this material, arising from its liability to twist in\r\nburning. For this and other reasons the architect abandoned the idea of\r\na Renaissance building, and fell back on the earlier Romanesque style\r\nwhich prevailed largely in Lombardy and the Rhineland from the tenth to\r\nthe end of the twelfth century.\r\n\r\n“In 1873, a contract was entered into by the Government with Messrs.\r\nGeorge Baker and Sons, of Lambeth, for the erection of the building at\r\na cost of £352,000. Other subsequent contracts have been entered into\r\nby the Treasury, especially one for the erection of the towers, which\r\nin the first instance it was decided to omit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exterior.]\r\n\r\n“On looking at the exterior of the building, one of the first points\r\nwhich strikes a spectator is that the site is lower than the street.\r\nThis arises from the fact that the whole surface of the ground between\r\nthe three roads was excavated for the Exhibition building of 1862, and\r\nit was not thought desirable, for economical considerations, to refill\r\nthe space. The building is set back 100 feet from the Cromwell Road,\r\nand is approached by two inclined planes, curved on plan and supported\r\nby arches, forming carriage-ways. Between the two are broad flights of\r\nCraigleith stone steps, for the use of those approaching the building\r\non foot. The extreme length of the front is 675 feet, and the height of\r\nthe towers is 192 feet. The return fronts, east and west, beyond the\r\nend pavilions, have not yet been erected.[2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interior. Central Hall.]\r\n\r\n“On entering the main portal, the visitor has before him the great\r\ncentral apartment of the Museum (170 feet long, by 97 feet wide, and 72\r\nfeet high), which it is intended to use as an Index or Typical Museum.\r\nThe double arch in the immediate foreground which spans the nave (57\r\nfeet wide), carries the staircase from the first to the second floor.\r\nOpposite the spectator, at the end of the hall, is the first flight\r\nof the staircase, 20 feet wide, which rises from the ground to the\r\nfirst floor. The galleries over the side recesses form the connection\r\nbetween the two staircases, and are also intended for exhibition space,\r\nas are also the floor of the main hall and the side recesses under the\r\ngalleries. The arches under the side-flights of the main staircase at\r\nthe end of the hall lead into another large apartment, with an extreme\r\nlength of 97 by 77 feet measured into the arms of the cross.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Side galleries.]\r\n\r\n“Branching out of the Central Hall, near its southern extremity, are\r\ntwo long galleries, each 278 feet 6 inches long by 50 feet wide.\r\nThese galleries are repeated on the first floor, and in a modified\r\nform on the second floor. They are divided into bays by coupled piers\r\narranged in two rows down the length of the galleries, and planned in\r\nsuch a manner as to allow of upright cases being placed back to back\r\nbetween the piers and the outer walls, so as to get the best possible\r\nlight upon the objects displayed in the cases with the least amount\r\nof reflection from the glass, and leaving the central space free as a\r\npassage. Owing to the nature of the specimens exhibited in one or two\r\nof these galleries requiring for their exhibition rather table-cases\r\nthan wall-cases, advantage has only been taken to a limited extent\r\nof this disposition of the plan. These terra-cotta piers, however,\r\nare constructively necessary, not only to conceal the iron supports\r\nfor the floor above, but to prevent these supports being affected in\r\ncase of fire. Behind these galleries on the ground floor are a series\r\nof toplighted galleries, devoted, on the east side to Geology and\r\nPalæontology, and on the west to Zoology.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Towers.]\r\n\r\n“The towers on the north of the building have each a central\r\nsmoke-shaft from the heating apparatus, the boilers of which are placed\r\nin the basement, immediately between the towers, while the space\r\nsurrounding the smoke-shafts is used for drawing off the vitiated air\r\nfrom the various galleries contiguous thereto. The front galleries\r\nare ventilated into the front towers, which form the crowning feature\r\nof the main front. These towers also contain, above the second floor,\r\nvarious rooms for the work of the different departments, and on the\r\ntopmost storey large cisterns for the purpose of always having at hand\r\na considerable storage of water in case of fire. On the western side\r\nof the building, where it is intended that the Zoological collection\r\nshall be placed, the ornamentation of the terra-cotta (which will\r\nbe found very varied both within and without the building) has been\r\nbased exclusively on living organisms. On the east side, where Geology\r\nand Palæontology find a home, the terra-cotta ornamentation has been\r\nderived from extinct specimens.\r\n\r\n“The Museum is the largest, if not, indeed, the only, modern building\r\nin which terra-cotta has been exclusively used for external façades and\r\ninterior wall-surfaces, including all the varied decoration which this\r\ninvolves.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gardens.]\r\n\r\nThe gardens on the south, east, and west sides of the Museum are\r\nopen to the public whenever the Museum itself is open, under certain\r\nregulations, posted at the entrance gates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ARRANGEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Use of the term Natural History.]\r\n\r\nNatural History is an old term, used to describe the study of all the\r\nprocesses or laws of the Universe, and the results of the action of\r\nthose processes or laws upon such of its constituent materials _as are\r\nindependent of the agency of man_.\r\n\r\nIt is thus contrasted with the history of Man and his works, and the\r\nchanges which have been wrought in the World by Man’s intervention.\r\n\r\nThis distinction afforded a convenient and rational basis for the\r\ndivision of the numerous and multifarious objects which had been\r\ncollected together in the British Museum at Bloomsbury. When it was\r\ndecided to effect a separation of the collections, those that were\r\npurely the products of what are commonly called “natural” forces were\r\nremoved to South Kensington, while those showing the effects of Man’s\r\nhandiwork remained at Bloomsbury. Like most others of the kind, this\r\ndistinction cannot be applied very rigidly. Such lines of demarcation\r\nalmost always overlap. For instance, examples of modification of animal\r\nor plant structure under Man’s influence legitimately find a place in a\r\nMuseum of Natural History, especially as they may afford illustrations\r\nof the mode of working of natural laws. Prehistoric stone-implements,\r\nagain, are shown in the Geological Department, in order to illustrate\r\nthe co-existence of Man with extinct Mammals.\r\n\r\nProcesses or laws cannot, however, be satisfactorily demonstrated in\r\na museum; therefore such branches of knowledge as deal chiefly with\r\nthese, as Astronomy, Geology (in the stricter sense of the word), and\r\nthe experimental sciences, as Physics, Chemistry and Physiology, though\r\nessentially belonging to the domain of Natural History, have not found\r\na place in the Natural History Museum. It is only the results of the\r\nworking of these processes or laws, as shown in the modifications of\r\nthe arrangement of the elementary substances of which the material of\r\nthe Universe is composed, which can be fully illustrated by specimens\r\nadmitting of being readily preserved and permanently exhibited in a\r\nmuseum. A Natural History Museum, therefore, in the sense in which the\r\nterm is now usually understood, is a collection of the various objects,\r\nanimate and inanimate, found in a state of nature. It will be readily\r\nunderstood that as the study of such objects is one of the principal\r\nmeans by which the laws leading to their formation or arrangement may\r\nbe traced out, it is of the utmost importance for the progress of those\r\ndepartments of knowledge which the Museum is designed to cultivate,\r\nto bring together as full an illustrative series of these objects as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Division into Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the validity of the division of natural objects into\r\n_inorganic_ and _organic_ or _living_ has been the subject of some\r\ndiscussion, and although the separation of the latter into _vegetable_\r\nand _animal_ is less absolute than was once supposed, yet for practical\r\npurposes, MINERAL, VEGETABLE, and ANIMAL remain the three great\r\ndivisions or “kingdoms” into which natural bodies are grouped, and\r\nthis classification has formed the basis of the arrangement of the\r\ncollections in the Museum.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mineral Department.]\r\n\r\nI. Inorganic substances occur in nature in a gaseous, liquid, or solid\r\nform. With few exceptions, it is only in the latter state that they\r\ncan be conveniently preserved and exhibited in a museum, and it is\r\nto such that the term “mineral” is commonly limited. The collection,\r\nclassification, and exhibition of specimens of this kind is the office\r\nof the Mineral Department of the Museum, to which is devoted the large\r\ngallery on the first floor of the east wing of the building.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Botanical Department.]\r\n\r\nII. The study of the vegetable kingdom, so far as it can be illustrated\r\nby preserved specimens, is the province of the Department of Botany,\r\nwhich occupies the upper floor of the east wing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Zoological Department.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Entomological Department.]\r\n\r\nIII. In the same way the animal kingdom belongs to the Department\r\nof Zoology, from which it has been found necessary to separate an\r\nEntomological Department. To these two is assigned the whole of the\r\nwestern wing of the building.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geological Department.]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a fifth department, which owes its separate\r\nexistence to a time when the terms Zoology and Botany were limited\r\nto the study of the existing forms of animal and plant life, and the\r\nextinct or fossil forms were associated with minerals, rather than\r\nwith their living representatives. This arrangement prevailed in the\r\nBritish Museum until the year 1857. The fossils were then severed from\r\nthis incongruous connection, and placed in a separate department to\r\nwhich the name of “Geology” was given.[3] The result is that there are\r\ntwo distinct zoological and botanical collections in the building, one\r\ncontaining the remains of the animals and plants which lived through\r\nsuccessive ages of the world’s history from the earliest dawn of life\r\ndown to close upon the present time, and the other including those\r\nliving at the particular period in which we dwell. Notwithstanding the\r\nobjections which may be urged against this separation, it prevails\r\nlargely in museums, and (owing to certain conveniences, as well as to\r\nthe difficulty and expense of rearranging extensive collections and\r\nreorganising the staff in charge of them) will probably be retained\r\nfor some time to come. It should, however, be mentioned that a few\r\nspecimens illustrating some of the more important extinct forms have\r\nbeen intercalated among the recent Mammals and Reptiles; while,\r\nconversely, skeletons and other specimens of recent animals have been\r\nintroduced among the fossil Vertebrates in the Geological Department.\r\nAgain, the more important remains of extinct Cetaceans are now shown in\r\nthe Whale-Room, and some of the specimens of recent Elephants, as well\r\nas all the Sea-Cows, in the Geological Department.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Introductory Collection.]\r\n\r\nBesides the five Departments, into which the collection is divided for\r\nthe purposes of custody and administration, each of which is under the\r\ncharge of an officer styled “Keeper” and a staff of Assistants, there\r\nis a sixth, under the supervision of the Director, and arranged in the\r\nCentral Hall, some of the specimens in which are intended to serve as\r\nan introduction to those exhibited in the others.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The specimens all arranged in three series.]\r\n\r\nInclusive of the last-named collection, the whole of the specimens\r\ncontained in the Museum, whether Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral, are\r\narranged in the three following distinct series, as follows:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Introductory or Elementary Series.]\r\n\r\nI. An Elementary or Introductory Series, by which the study of every\r\ngroup should commence. In this series, limited, so far as the cases\r\nin the Central Hall are concerned, to Vertebrated Animals and Botany,\r\nthe leading features of the structure, and, so far as may be, the\r\ndevelopment of the various parts of some of the more typical members\r\nof each group, are demonstrated in a simple manner, and the terms used\r\nin describing and defining them explained by means of illustrative\r\nexamples. This idea is carried out in the Department of Minerals in a\r\nseries of cases placed on the north or left-hand side of the gallery\r\ncontaining the rest of the collection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Exhibited Systematic Series.]\r\n\r\nII. The Exhibited Systematic Series, in which the more important types\r\nof animals, plants, or minerals are shown, by means of specimens,\r\narranged in a systematic manner; or one which exhibits, so far as\r\nmay be, their natural relations to each other. Classification is an\r\nimportant feature in this series, which properly should be so extensive\r\nand so arranged as to enable visitors to the Museum, without recourse\r\nto assistance from the officials, to find every well-known and markedly\r\ndistinct type of animal, plant, or mineral, and satisfy themselves\r\nabout, at least, its external characters. In practice, with the\r\namount of space available, and the resources at the disposal of the\r\nauthorities, it has, however, been found impracticable to carry out\r\nthis ideal in anything like its entirety, and in most instances only a\r\nselection of specimens is in consequence exhibited.\r\n\r\nWhile the two series above mentioned have for their object the\r\n_diffusion_ of scientific knowledge, the next ministers mainly to its\r\n_advancement_, so that between them the twofold object of a National\r\nMuseum of Natural History is carried out.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reserve or Study Systematic Series.]\r\n\r\nIII. The Reserve or Study Systematic Series contains the exceedingly\r\nnumerous specimens (in many groups the great bulk of the collection)\r\nshowing the minute distinctions required for working out the problems\r\nof variation according to age, sex, season and locality, for fixing\r\nthe limits of geographical distribution, or determining the range\r\nin geological time: distinctions which, in most cases, can only be\r\nappreciated when the specimens are kept under such conditions as to\r\nadmit of ready and close examination and comparison. It is to this\r\npart of the collection that naturalists resort to compare and name the\r\nanimals and plants collected in exploring expeditions, to work out\r\nnatural-history problems, and generally to advance the knowledge of\r\nscience. In fact, these reserve collections, occupying comparatively\r\nlittle space, kept up at relatively small cost, and visited by\r\ncomparatively few persons, constitute, from a scientific point of\r\nview, the most important part of the Museum; for by their means new\r\nknowledge is obtained, which, given forth to the world in the form of\r\nmemoirs and books, is ultimately diffused over a far wider area than\r\nthat influenced even by the exhibited portions of the Museum. Indeed,\r\nwithout the means of study afforded by the reserve series, the order\r\ndisplayed in the arrangement of the exhibition galleries, and the\r\ninstruction which may be gleaned from the same, would not be possible.\r\n\r\nIt is important to bear in mind that if all the specimens required for\r\nenlarging the boundaries of knowledge were displayed in the public\r\ngalleries, so that each could be distinctly seen, a museum many times\r\nlarger than the present one would not suffice to contain them; the\r\nspecimens themselves would be inaccessible to those capable of deriving\r\ninstruction from their examination, while, owing to the effects of\r\nexposure to light upon preserved natural objects, many would lose their\r\nchief characteristics. This portion of the collection must, in fact,\r\nbe treated as are the books in a library and used for consultation and\r\nreference by accredited students.[4]\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the Museum the reserve collections are contained\r\nin drawers beneath the cases in which the corresponding exhibited\r\nportion is placed. This applies principally to the fossil specimens,\r\nthe shells, and the minerals. The reserve birds and insects have\r\nspecial rooms devoted to them, and the extensive series of reptiles,\r\nfishes, and other animals preserved in spirit is kept, for the purpose\r\nof safety, in a separate building behind the Museum. In the Botanical\r\nDepartment the reserve collections are kept in the well-known form of\r\nan Herbarium, or _Hortus siccus_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Supplementary Collections.]\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the specimens being arranged in these three\r\nseries, supplementary collections for facilitating the study of the\r\ndistribution of animals and plants in space and in time would be\r\nadvantageous. The first, constituting a geographical series, might\r\nshow by illustrative examples the leading characteristics of the fauna\r\nand flora of each great region of the earth’s surface; the second,\r\nor palæontological series, would give examples of the fossil remains\r\nfound most abundantly in each formation, arranged so far as may be in\r\nchronological order.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geographical.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geological.]\r\n\r\nThe only attempt hitherto made at exhibiting a geographical series in\r\nthe Museum is the collection of terrestrial and fresh-water vertebrated\r\nanimals of the British Isles, arranged in the pavilion at the west end\r\nof the bird gallery. It would be difficult in the present building to\r\nfind room for other geographical collections, however interesting and\r\ninstructive. With regard to palæontological collections, although the\r\nspecimens in the Department of Geology, so called, are mainly arranged\r\nnot geologically, or according to stratigraphical position, but\r\naccording to their natural affinities, yet, in many cases, it has been\r\nfound convenient to adopt a mixed arrangement, the specimens within\r\neach large natural group being classified according to the sequence\r\nin age of the strata in which they were buried. Such an arrangement,\r\nhowever, is only applicable to the fossils of a particular region,\r\nowing to the difficulties in accurately determining the correspondence\r\nin age of formations occurring in distant parts of the earth’s surface;\r\nhence a large and varied palæontological collection, such as that of\r\nthe British Museum, is best arranged in the main upon a systematic\r\nor zoological and botanical basis. A limited series showing the more\r\ncharacteristic British rock-formations with their included fossil\r\nremains, placed in chronological sequence, is arranged in one of the\r\ngalleries of the Geological Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE MUSEUM AND ITS CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn entering the Museum, the visitor should bear in mind that the\r\nprincipal front faces the south, so that he will be looking due north,\r\nwith the east on his right, and the west on his left hand.\r\n\r\nIt must also not be forgotten that a museum in a state of active growth\r\nis continually receiving additions as well as undergoing changes in the\r\narrangement of its contents, and since these often occur faster than\r\nnew editions of the Guide can be produced, there may be variations in\r\nthe positions of some of the specimens from those here given.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENTRAL HALL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Statues and Cases in the Central Hall.]\r\n\r\nOn entering the hall the visitor will notice the bronze statue of the\r\nlate Sir Richard Owen, K.C.B., Superintendent of the Natural History\r\nDepartments of the British Museum (1856–1884). It is the work of Mr. T.\r\nBrock, R.A., and was placed in the Museum on March 17th, 1897. To the\r\nright of this is a marble statue of the late Professor T. H. Huxley,\r\nsculptured by Mr. E. Onslow Ford, R.A., which was unveiled on April\r\n28th, 1900. In the first bay on the left is a bust, by Mr. Brock, of\r\nthe late Sir W. H. Flower, Director of the Natural History Departments\r\nof the British Museum from 1884 to 1898. Most of the cases placed on\r\nthe floor of the hall illustrate general laws or points of interest in\r\nnatural history which do not come appropriately for illustration within\r\nthe systematic collections of the departmental series.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pigeons illustrating Variation under Domestication.]\r\n\r\nOne group, in a case near the entrance to the hall, on the right,\r\nshows the great variation to which a species may become subject under\r\nthe influence of domestication, as illustrated by examples of the\r\nbest-marked breeds of Pigeons, all derived by selection from the wild\r\nRock-Dove (_Columba livia_), specimens of which are shown at the top of\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fowls and Canaries illustrating Variation under\r\nDomestication.]\r\n\r\nIn the corresponding case on the left are further illustrations of\r\nthe same subject. A pair of red Jungle Fowl (_Gallus bankiva_, or _G.\r\nferrugineus_) of India represents the species from which the breeds\r\nof Domesticated Fowls are generally considered to have been derived.\r\nAs examples of extreme modifications in opposite directions produced\r\nby selection, are exhibited the Japanese Long-tailed Fowls, in which\r\nsome of the feathers (tail-coverts) attain a length of nine feet,\r\nand specimens of a breed in which the tail is absent. There is also\r\nshown a group of Fowls living wild in the woods of the Fiji Islands,\r\nwhich are descendants from domesticated birds introduced in the\r\neighteenth century. A pair of Cochin Fowls is exhibited in the same\r\ncase to display development in point of size and in the abundance of\r\nfeathers on the limbs; while a pair of white “Silkies” illustrates a\r\nmodification of the plumage, accompanied by a rudimentary condition of\r\nthe tail-feathers. The pair of Coloured Dorkings exemplifies a breed\r\ncultivated in England.\r\n\r\nA series of Canaries is shown in a case in the archway leading from\r\nthe east side of the central hall to the north hall, as an example of\r\na late addition to domesticated animals, these birds having been first\r\nimported into Europe from the Canary Islands in the early part of the\r\nsixteenth century. Specimens are exhibited of the wild birds, and of\r\nsome of the modifications produced by selection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ruffs and Reeves, illustrating Changes of Plumage according\r\nto Sex and Season.]\r\n\r\nA case placed to the north of the one containing Fowls illustrates\r\na remarkable instance of external differences in the two sexes and\r\nchanges in plumage at different seasons, not under the influence\r\nof domestication. The birds in it belong to one species, the Ruff\r\n(_Pavoncella_, or _Machetes_, _pugnax_), of which the female is called\r\nReeve; a member of the Plover family (_Charadriidæ_). In the upper\r\ndivision of the case are shown the eggs, newly-hatched young, and young\r\nmales and females in the first autumn plumage; as well as adult males\r\nand females in winter, when both sexes are exactly alike in colour and\r\ndistinguishable externally by size alone. The large group occupying the\r\nlower part of this case consists of adult birds in the plumage assumed\r\nin the breeding time (May and June). In the female the only alteration\r\nfrom the winter state is a darker and richer colouring, but in the\r\nmales there is a special growth of elongated feathers about the head\r\nand neck, constituting the “ruff” from which the bird derives its name.\r\nIn addition to this peculiarity, another, rare among wild animals,\r\nmay be observed, namely, striking diversity of colour in different\r\nindividuals. Of the twenty-three specimens shown no two are entirely\r\nalike.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wild Ducks illustrating Seasonal Change of Plumage.]\r\n\r\nNext in order stands a case displaying the variations, according to\r\nseason and age, in the plumage of the Wild Duck, or Mallard (_Anas\r\nboscas_). The most noticeable feature in the plumage-changes is the\r\nassumption in summer by males of an “eclipse-plumage,” resembling\r\nthe one worn by females at all seasons. At other times the males are\r\nmore brilliantly coloured than their partners. The eclipse-plumage\r\ncorresponds to the winter, or non-breeding, dress of other birds which\r\nhave a seasonal change.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adaptation of Colour to surrounding Conditions.]\r\n\r\nOn the same side of the hall follow two cases illustrating the\r\nadaptation of the colour of animals to their natural surroundings, by\r\nmeans of which they are rendered less conspicuous to their enemies or\r\ntheir prey. The first contains a specimen of a Mountain or Variable\r\nHare (the common species of the north of Europe), a Stoat, and a\r\nWeasel, together with some Willow-Grouse and Ptarmigan, as well as\r\nan Arctic Fox, in their summer dresses. All were obtained in Norway,\r\nand show the general harmony of their colouring at this season with\r\nthat of the rocks and plants among which they live. The second case\r\ndisplays examples of the same animals obtained from the same country in\r\nwinter, when the ground was covered with snow. Such striking changes\r\nas these only occur in latitudes and localities where the differences\r\nbetween the general external conditions in the different seasons are\r\nextreme, where the snow disappears in summer and remains on the ground\r\nduring most of the winter. Even some of the species here shown do not\r\nhabitually turn white in the less severe winters of their southern\r\nrange, as the Stoat in England and the Variable Hare in Ireland. A\r\nfew permanent inhabitants of still more northern regions, where the\r\nsnow remains throughout the year, such as the Polar Bear, Alaskan\r\nBighorn Sheep, Greenland Falcon, and Snowy Owl, retain the white\r\ndress throughout the year. The whiteness of these animals must not be\r\nconfounded with _albinism_, or whiteness occurring in individuals of\r\nspecies normally of a different colour, which is illustrated in a case\r\non the other side of the hall.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Protective Resemblance of Desert Animals to their\r\nSurroundings.]\r\n\r\nThe case on the east side of the hall nearest the great staircase\r\ncontains examples of conformity of general style of colouring to\r\nsurrounding conditions, as exemplified by some of the commoner Birds,\r\nMammals, and Reptiles of the Egyptian desert, placed on the stones\r\nand sand amid which they habitually dwell. The advantage of this\r\ncolouring in concealing the herbivorous species from their enemies,\r\nand in enabling the carnivorous to approach their prey unperceived,\r\nis obvious. Many excellent cases of concealment by adaptation to\r\nsurroundings, especially in eggs and young Birds, may be seen among the\r\ngroups in the Bird-gallery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mimicry.]\r\n\r\nMore special modifications for the same purpose are shown in the\r\nadjacent bay on the east side of the hall by Insects which closely\r\nresemble the objects, such as leaves, twigs, etc., among which\r\nthey dwell. The close imitation of a dead leaf, presented by the\r\nLeaf-Butterfly (_Callima inachis_), when its wings are closed, could\r\nnot be surpassed. In a further stage of the same condition, called\r\n“Mimicry,” the object resembled, or mimicked, is another living\r\nanimal, belonging to a different species, family, or even order. The\r\nresemblance in these instances is also believed to be for protection,\r\nor to be in some way advantageous to the animal in which it occurs.\r\nWe know, however, so little of the habits and life-history of animals\r\nin a state of nature that many of the purposes supposed to be served\r\nby particular colours or appearances can only be regarded at present\r\nas conjectural. Whatever be the real explanation, the facts shown by\r\nthe specimens in this bay are very curious, and worthy of careful\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Group illustrating Albinism.]\r\n\r\nThe next case on the east side of the middle of the hall contains a\r\nseries of specimens illustrating _albinism_, a condition in which the\r\npigment, or colouring matter, usually present in the skin, hair, or\r\nfeathers, and giving the characteristic hue, is absent. Individuals\r\nin this condition occur among many animals of various kinds, and\r\nare called “_albinos_.” In some of the specimens shown in the case\r\nthe albinism is complete, but in many it is partial, the absence of\r\ncolouring matter being limited to certain portions of the surface.\r\nOther examples of complete or partial albinism are shown in the North\r\nHall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--THE LEAF-BUTTERFLY (_Callima inachis_) IN\r\nFLIGHT AND AT REST.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Group illustrating Melanism.]\r\n\r\nThe adjacent case shows examples of the opposite condition called\r\n_melanism_, depending upon an excess of dark colouring matter or\r\npigment in the skin and its appendages, such as hair, feathers, etc.,\r\nbeyond what is commonly met with in the species. This is by no means\r\nso frequent as albinism. A black Leopard in the middle of the case\r\nis a good illustration. This is not a distinct species, but merely\r\nan individual variety of the common Leopard, born from parents of\r\nthe normal colour. A black Bullfinch is introduced as an example of\r\nacquired melanism, this bird having turned black in captivity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--THE SOMALI TSETSE-FLY (_Glossina longipennis_).\r\nEnlarged 4 diameters.\r\n\r\nShows the complete closure of the wings in the resting position, and\r\nthe prominent proboscis, characteristic of the genus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Group illustrating Intermediate Forms in Nature.]\r\n\r\nAnother group shows that two forms of Crows which appear quite\r\ndistinct, and, judged by their external characters, might be regarded\r\nas different species, may in a state of nature unite, and produce\r\nhybrid offspring. In the same case is exhibited a series of Goldfinches\r\nto show a complete gradation between birds of different colouring,\r\nwhich have been regarded as different species. Both these examples may\r\nby some naturalists be considered instances, not of the crossing of\r\ndistinct species, but of “dimorphism,” or the occurrence of a single\r\nspecies in nature in two different phases. From whatever point of view\r\nthey may be regarded, they illustrate the difficulty of defining and\r\nlimiting the meaning of the term “species,” of such constant use in\r\nnatural history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mosquitoes and Tsetse-Flies.]\r\n\r\nIn the middle line of the hall are placed cases containing greatly\r\nenlarged models of certain Insects concerned in the spread of disease,\r\nsuch as Mosquitoes or Gnats (figs. 3 and 4), a House-Fly, Tsetse-Fly\r\n(fig. 2), and Plague-Flea; also still more enlarged gelatine models\r\nof mammalian blood-corpuscles, showing the parasites by which they\r\nare infested in the diseases respectively communicated by means of\r\nMosquitoes and Tsetses. Models of the parasites themselves are also\r\nshown (figs. 5 and 6).\r\n\r\nMalaria, or ague, is a disease caused by extremely minute parasites\r\nwhich live in the red corpuscles of the blood. Formerly malaria was\r\nbelieved to be contracted by merely breathing the air of marshy\r\ndistricts, but it is now proved that the parasites are transmitted from\r\nman to man by the “bite,” or rather “stab,” of a Mosquito or Gnat. The\r\nCommon Mosquito or Stabbing Gnat (_Culex pipiens_), fig. 3, does not\r\ntransmit the malaria-parasite; the Spot-winged Mosquitoes (fig. 4) of\r\nthe genus _Anopheles_, abundant in England and nearly all parts of the\r\nworld, being the carriers. The parasite multiplies not only in the\r\nhuman blood, but in the stomach and tissues of the Gnat--as shown in\r\nthe models (fig. 5).\r\n\r\nTsetse-Flies are African blood-sucking Flies, with the mouth-parts\r\nadapted for piercing the skins of wild and domesticated mammals, human\r\nbeings, and even crocodiles. The blood of some of the larger African\r\nanimals is sometimes infected with a microscopic parasite (fig. 6),\r\nwhich, if sucked up by Tsetse-Flies when feeding, and subsequently\r\nintroduced by them into the veins of domesticated animals such as\r\nhorses and cattle, produces the fatal _nagana_, or Tsetse-Fly disease.\r\nSleeping-sickness in man is caused in a similar manner, and is conveyed\r\nfrom infected to healthy individuals by two kinds of Tsetse-Fly,\r\nincluding that of which an enlarged model, 28 times (linear) natural\r\nsize, is exhibited. The parasites and the red blood-corpuscles are\r\nenlarged 6,000 diameters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--(_a_) THE COMMON GNAT (_Culex pipiens_).\r\nEnlarged.\r\n\r\nFIG. 4.--(_b_) THE SPOT-WINGED MOSQUITO (_Anopheles maculipennis_).\r\nEnlarged.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--LIFE-HISTORY OF THE MALARIA PARASITE.\r\n\r\n  _a_, malarial germ, or sporozoite, as introduced into the blood by\r\n      the mosquito; _b_, sporozoite after entry into blood-corpuscle;\r\n      _c_, growth of sporozoite into an amœbula; _d_, division of\r\n      amœbula to form merozoites; _e_, liberated merozoites; _f_,\r\n      growth of merozoites into a crescent at expense of corpuscle;\r\n      _g_, male, and _h_, female crescent; _i_, male cell with\r\n      projections, which lengthen and are set free as spermatozoa; _j_,\r\n      fertilisation of ovum by spermatozoon; _k_, fertilised egg as the\r\n      active motile vermicule; sphere formed from the _l_, enlarged\r\n      vermicule, after this has bored through the stomach-wall of the\r\n      mosquito; _m_, segment of sphere at final stage of development,\r\n      containing countless needle-shaped spores, which, when it bursts,\r\n      escape as sporozoites into the organs of the mosquito’s body\r\n      and pass through the salivary glands into the proboscis, and so\r\n      infect a man bitten or pricked by the mosquito.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe House-Fly--_see_ enlarged models of the perfect insect and its\r\npreliminary stages,--although not provided with a piercing proboscis,\r\nand consequently incapable of biting, sometimes plays an important part\r\nin spreading deadly diseases, such as cholera and enteric (typhoid)\r\nfever. In this case the disease-causing organisms are carried by the\r\ninsect either in its intestine or adherent to the outer surface of its\r\nbody, and thus House-Flies may spread disease by contaminating food.\r\n\r\nPlague, which is a disease of rats and a few other rodents, especially\r\nthe bobac Marmot, is communicated to man by the bite of the flea\r\nknown as _Xenopsylla cheopis_, one of several species of fleas with\r\nwhich rats are infested. When a rat dies, the fleas that it has been\r\nharbouring seek another host, and may bite human beings, in which case,\r\nif the rat itself was suffering from the disease, an epidemic of plague\r\nmay be the result. The model of the Plague-Flea exhibited is enlarged\r\n200 times (linear).\r\n\r\nThe Arachnida, a group which includes the Spiders and can generally\r\nbe distinguished from Insects by the number of their legs (four pairs\r\ninstead of three pairs), include also the Ticks, which are responsible\r\nfor the transmission of many deadly diseases which attack Man and\r\nDomestic animals. Enlarged models of a disease-carrying Tick are in\r\ncourse of preparation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.\r\n\r\n  _Trypanosoma gambiense_, the parasite of Sleeping-sickness, very\r\n    highly magnified. The occurrence of three kinds of individual,\r\n    as shown in the figure, appears to be characteristic of this and\r\n    certain other species of _Trypanosoma_.\r\n\r\n(After Col. Sir D. Bruce.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: African Elephant.]\r\n\r\nIn the middle line of the hall is placed a magnificent mounted skin\r\nof an African Elephant (_Elephas africanus_), fig. 7, from Rhodesia,\r\nstanding about 11 feet 4 inches in height. The skull of the same\r\nindividual is mounted on a stand below. Near by are exhibited three\r\ntusks, the largest of which measures 10 feet 2½ inches in length. On\r\nthe north wall, on either side of the Darwin statue, are mounted two\r\nAfrican Elephant heads.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bays or Alcoves round the Hall.]\r\n\r\nMost of the bays or alcoves round the hall, five on each side, are\r\n(with the exception of the one at the north end of the right side)\r\ndevoted to the Introductory or Elementary Collection, designed to\r\nillustrate the more important points in the structure of certain types\r\nof animal and plant life, and the terms used in describing them. This\r\nhas been called the “Index Museum,” as it was thought at one time that\r\nit would form a sort of epitome or index of the general collections in\r\nthe galleries. It is now mainly restricted to a display of the leading\r\nstructural features in Vertebrated Animals and in Plants. The space\r\nbeing limited, the number of specimens is necessarily restricted. In\r\nexamining this collection the visitor should follow each case in the\r\nusual order of reading a book, from left to right, and carefully study\r\nthe printed explanatory labels, to which the specimens are intended to\r\nserve as illustrations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--AFRICAN ELEPHANT (_Elephas africanus_).\r\n\r\nThe skull and tusks seen in the foreground are those of the stuffed\r\nspecimen, the tusks in which have been modelled from another\r\nindividual.]\r\n\r\nThe bays on the west side (left-hand on entering the hall) are devoted\r\nto the Vertebrata, or Animals possessing a “backbone.” In Nos. I and\r\nII are shown the characters of the Mammals, which form the highest\r\nmodification of this type; the wall-cases of No. I containing specimens\r\nof the bony framework (internal skeleton).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bay I. Skeleton of Mammals.]\r\n\r\nIn the first case (south side of the recess) may be seen a complete\r\nskeleton of a good example of the class--a Baboon Monkey, with the\r\nbones laid out on a tablet, and their names affixed. Below is a\r\nskeleton of the same animal articulated, or with the bones in their\r\nnatural relation to each other, and also named. By examining these\r\ntwo specimens an idea may be obtained of the general framework of\r\nthe bodies of animals of this class. In other parts of the case are\r\nexhibited various modifications of the skeleton to suit different\r\nconditions of life.\r\n\r\n1. Man, showing a skeleton adapted for the upright posture.\r\n\r\n2. A Bat, or flying Mammal, in which, by the great elongation of the\r\nfingers, the fore-limbs are converted into wings (fig. 8), supporting a\r\nweb of skin stretched between them.\r\n\r\n3. A Sloth, in which the tips of both limbs are reduced to mere hooks,\r\nby the aid of which the creature hangs back-downwards from the boughs\r\nof the trees among which it passes its entire existence.\r\n\r\n4. The Baboon serves as an example of an animal walking on all four\r\nlimbs in the “plantigrade” position, i.e., with the whole of the palms\r\nof the hands and the soles of the feet applied to the ground.\r\n\r\n5. A small species of Antelope shows the characteristic form of a\r\nrunning animal, in which the limbs perform no office but that of\r\nsupporting the body on the ground. This animal stands on the tips of\r\nthe toes of its elongated, slender feet in the “digitigrade” fashion.\r\n\r\n6. A Porpoise, adapted solely for swimming in the water. The fore-limbs\r\nare converted into flattened paddles, and the hind-limbs are entirely\r\nabsent, their function being performed by the tail. The rudimentary\r\npelvic bones are preserved.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the case is occupied by details of the skull in some of its\r\nprincipal modifications. At the top are diagrams of the structure of\r\nbone and cartilage as shown by the microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--THE SKELETON OF A FLYING-FOX, OR FOX-BAT\r\n(_Pteropus medius_).\r\n\r\n  _cl_, clavicle; _cv_, cervical vertebræ; _d_, dorsal vertebræ; _fb_,\r\n      fibula; _fm_, femur; _h_, humerus; _hx_, great toe, or hallux;\r\n      _l_, lumbar vertebræ; _mc_, metacarpals; _mt_, metatarsals; _ph_,\r\n      phalanges, or finger- and toe-bones; _pv_, pelvis; _px_, thumb,\r\n      or pollex; _r_, radius; _s_, sacral vertebræ; _sc_, scapula;\r\n      _sk_, skull; _tb_, tibia; _ts_, tarsus; _u_, ulna.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the wall-case on the opposite (north) side of the bay the study\r\nof the skeleton of Mammals is continued by illustrations of the\r\nstructure of the limbs. At the top of the case is a diagram showing the\r\ncorrespondence of the hand and the foot in their complete typical form,\r\nwith the names applied to the different bones. The series of specimens\r\nbelow shows the principal deviations actually occurring from this\r\ntypical condition, which, as may be seen, is very nearly preserved in\r\nthe human hand. One series shows some of the stages of modification for\r\nspecial purpose (specialisation) by which a typical five-fingered hand\r\nbecomes converted into the single-toed fore-foot of the Horse; while\r\nanother series ends with the fore-foot of the Ruminants, sometimes, but\r\nerroneously, called a “cloven hoof,” in which only two toes remain.\r\nSimilar changes are shown in the toes of the hind-foot, illustrating\r\nthe same common plan running through infinite modifications in detail,\r\nenabling the organ to perform such a variety of purposes, and to\r\nexhibit such diversity of outward appearance. The existence of this\r\ncommon plan is now generally regarded as due to inheritance from a\r\ncommon ancestor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Teeth of Mammals.]\r\n\r\nThe central case of the bay contains a collection illustrating the\r\nprincipal characters of the teeth of Mammals. Its inspection should\r\ncommence at the north-east corner, where the visitor will find himself\r\nafter completing the survey of the specimens of skeletons in the\r\nwall-cases. In the first division are placed specimens showing the\r\ngeneral characters of teeth, their form, the different tissues of\r\nwhich they are composed, the two great types of dentition in Mammals,\r\n_homœodont_ and _heterodont_,[5] the names and serial correspondence\r\nof the different teeth, and their development and succession. The\r\nprincipal modifications of teeth according to function are next\r\nshown by examples of forms adapted for fish-eating, flesh-eating,\r\ninsect-eating, grass-eating, etc. The remainder of the case is taken\r\nup by examples of the dentition of the families of Mammals arranged in\r\norder, and prepared so as to display not only the shape of the crowns,\r\nbut also the number and character of the roots by which they are\r\nimplanted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bay II. Classification of Mammals.]\r\n\r\nIn bay No. II the two wall-cases contain a collection arranged to show\r\nin a serial manner the orders and sub-orders of existing Mammals, by\r\nexamples selected to illustrate the predominating characters by which\r\nthese are distinguished. A brief popular account of the characteristics\r\nof the group, and a map showing its geographical distribution,\r\nare placed with each. This is intended to serve not only for an\r\nintroduction to the study of the class by visitors to the museum, but\r\nalso as a guide to a method of arrangement which may be adopted in\r\nsmaller institutions.\r\n\r\nAmong the illustrations of the order _Primates_ is placed the skeleton\r\nof a young Chimpanzee dissected by Dr. Tyson, which formed the subject\r\nof his work on the “Anatomy of a Pigmie,” published in 1699, the\r\nearliest scientific description of any Man-like Ape.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Skin of Mammals.]\r\n\r\nThe central case of this bay contains illustrations of the outer\r\ncovering or skin and its modifications in the class of Mammals, divided\r\ninto the following sections:\r\n\r\n1. Expansion of skin to aid in locomotion, as the webs between the\r\nfingers of swimming and flying animals, the parachutes of flying\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n2. The development of bony plates in the skin, found among Mammals only\r\nin the Armadillos and their allies. The cast of a section of the tail\r\nof a gigantic extinct species (_Glyptodon_) shows a bony external as\r\nwell as an internal skeleton.\r\n\r\n3. The outer covering modified into true scales, much resembling in\r\nstructure the nails of the human hand. This occurs in only one family\r\nof Mammals, the Pangolins, or _Manidæ_.\r\n\r\n4. Hair in various forms, including bristles and spines. The two kinds\r\nof hair composing the external clothing of most Mammals, the long,\r\nstiffer outer hair, and the short, soft under-fur, are shown by various\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\n5. The special epidermal appendages found in nearly all Mammals on the\r\nends of the fingers and toes, called according to the various forms\r\nthey assume, nails, claws, or hoofs.\r\n\r\n6. The one or two unpaired horns of the Rhinoceroses, shown by sections\r\nto consist of a solid mass of hair-like epidermic fibres.\r\n\r\n7. The horns of Oxen, Goats, and Antelopes, each consisting of a hollow\r\nconical sheath of horn, covering a permanent projection of the frontal\r\nbone (the horn-core).\r\n\r\n8. The antlers of Deer, forming solid, bony, and generally branched\r\nprojections, covered during growth with soft hairy skin, and in most\r\ncases shed and renewed annually.\r\n\r\nOn the wall is arranged a series of antlers of an individual Stag\r\nor Red Deer (_Cervus elaphus_), grown and shed (except the last) in\r\nthirteen successive years, showing the changes which took place in\r\ntheir size and form, and the development of the branches, or tines, in\r\neach year. In old age the number of these tines tends to diminish.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the table-case are shown dissections of the\r\nprincipal internal organs of Mammals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bay III. General structure of Birds.]\r\n\r\nBay No. III is devoted to the class of Birds. An Albatross (_Diomedea\r\nexulans_) mounted with the wings expanded shows the most important\r\ncharacters by which a Bird is externally distinguished from other\r\nanimals. The body is clothed with feathers, which (in the majority\r\nof Birds), by their great size and special arrangement upon the\r\nfore-limbs, enable these to act as organs of flight. The mouth is in\r\nthe form of a horny beak. A nestling Albatross shows that at this stage\r\nof its existence the bird is not clothed with ordinary feathers, but\r\nwith soft down, which serves to keep the body warm, although it confers\r\nno power of flight. An Emu and an Apteryx in the lower compartment\r\nof the case display the exceptional condition (found only in a\r\ncomparatively few members of the class) of Birds with wings so small\r\nas to be concealed beneath the general feathery covering of the body,\r\nand quite useless. In the Penguins, of which two species are shown\r\nin the case, the wings are reduced to the condition of fins, and are\r\nserviceable only for progress through water.\r\n\r\nIn the first wall-case the principal features of the skeleton of the\r\nclass are shown. Sections of bones exhibit the large air-cavities\r\nwithin; a complete skeleton of an Eagle, with the bones separated and\r\nnamed, and mounted skeletons of the Ostrich, Penguin, Pelican, Vulture,\r\nNight-Parrot, Fowl, etc., show the chief modifications of the skeleton.\r\nThe Apteryx possesses the smallest, and the Frigate-bird the longest\r\nbones of the wing, the correspondence of which can be readily traced\r\nby means of the labels attached to them. The under surfaces of the\r\nskulls of various birds are shown with the different bones coloured to\r\nindicate their limits and relations; these are followed by a series of\r\nthe different types of sternum or breast-bone.\r\n\r\nThe second wall-case contains further illustrations of the anatomy of\r\nBirds. In the left-hand part a series of wings of Birds displays the\r\nform characteristic of different groups; while above them are a few of\r\nthe different types of tails, supplementing the series of tails in the\r\ntable-case. Very instructive is a series of skins of white chickens of\r\nthe same brood at different ages, displaying the gradual replacement of\r\nthe down by the adult plumage.\r\n\r\nThe table-case in the middle of the bay contains illustrations of\r\nthe external characters, the beak, the feathers, and the tail, as\r\nwell as of the fore and hind limbs, or wings and feet. By the aid of\r\nthe explanatory labels, the essential characters and the principal\r\nmodifications of all these parts may easily be followed.\r\n\r\nTwo cases on the wall in the vestibule leading to the Fish Gallery\r\nillustrate the chief modifications of the eggs of Birds, and their\r\ndifferences in structure, number, form, size, texture of surface,\r\nand colour. On the side of the main staircase opposite are specimens\r\nillustrating the parasitic nesting habits of certain Cuckoos and\r\nvarious other Birds; while near by is a remarkably fine series of\r\nthe eggs of Cuckoos with those of the Birds among which they were\r\nrespectively deposited. On the opposite (east) side of the staircase\r\nthe visitor will find a case showing the remarkable variation in\r\ncolouring and markings displayed by the eggs of the Guillemot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bay IV. General structure of Reptiles and Amphibians.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth bay on the west side of the hall exhibits the leading\r\npeculiarities in the structure of Reptiles and Amphibians. Owing to\r\nthe large number of groups in the former class now extinct, many\r\nfossil specimens, or plaster reproductions of the same, are shown.\r\nThe wall-case on the south side of this bay illustrates the different\r\nordinal groups of Reptiles--living and extinct. Very instructive are\r\nthe skeletons of Tortoises and Turtles, showing the relations of the\r\nvertebræ and limb-bones to the bony part of the shell. Lizards and\r\nSnakes are mostly represented by coloured casts. The extinct Dinosaurs\r\nare represented by a small-sized model of _Iguanodon_, together with\r\na photograph of the skeleton and a plaster-cast of the bones of the\r\nhind-foot showing the three toes.\r\n\r\nThe adjacent side of the table-case shows the modifications of the\r\nbackbone, or vertebral column, of the ribs, and of the limbs, in the\r\ndifferent groups of the class. Specially noticeable are examples of\r\nfive types of Skink-like Lizards, exhibiting the gradual diminution in\r\nthe size of the limbs and their final disappearance.\r\n\r\nThe opposite, or north, side of the table-case displays the different\r\nmodifications of the skull and teeth of living and extinct Reptiles.\r\nIn some, like Crocodiles and Ichthyosaurs, the jaws are armed with\r\na full series of sharply pointed teeth, while in others, like the\r\nTortoises and Turtles, they are devoid of teeth and encased in horn.\r\nVery remarkable is the approximation to a carnivorous mammalian type\r\npresented by the dentition of some of the extinct mammal-like Reptiles,\r\nor Theromorphs, and equally noticeable are the palatal crushing teeth\r\nof certain other extinct Reptiles known as _Placodus_ and _Cyamodus_.\r\nThe peculiar dentition of the New Zealand Tuatera, and likewise that of\r\nits extinct European and Indian ally _Hyperodapedon_ (fig. 9), are also\r\nshown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 9.--SKULL OF THE GIANT TUATERA (_Hyperodapedon gordoni_), from\r\n      the Triassic Sandstone of Lossiemouth, Elgin, (¼ nat. size).

The median fins are not lettered.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the right half of the same case are exhibited a number of\r\npreparations showing the external form and internal structure of\r\nFrogs and Salamanders, or Amphibians, living and extinct. The Giant\r\nSalamander of Japan (_Megalobatrachus_ or _Cryptobranchus_) is\r\nrepresented by a stuffed specimen; but the Newts, Salamanders, and\r\nFrogs are shown in spirit. Very curious is the almost colourless and\r\nblind Olm (_Proteus_) from the caves of Carniola; as also are the\r\nso-called Cœcilians, or Apoda, which have the habits and, in some\r\ndegree, the appearance of large worms. Special specimens exhibit the\r\nstructure of the extinct Labyrinthodonts, in which the hinder half of\r\nthe skull is completely roofed over by bone; while the teeth in many\r\ninstances exhibit a curious in-folded arrangement from which the group\r\nderives its name.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bay V. Structure of Fishes.]\r\n\r\nThe last bay (No. V) on the west side of the Central Hall is devoted to\r\nthe display of the form and structure of Fishes.\r\n\r\nThe wall-case on the left side of this bay exhibits the external\r\nform of several characteristic types of Fishes, such as the Pike,\r\nCod, Turbot, Dog-fish, and Skate, with the names of the various fins\r\naffixed. A striking specimen is the skeleton--mainly cartilaginous--of\r\nthe Great Blue Shark (_Carcharodon rondeletii_), fig. 10, which\r\noccupies the greater portion of this case. It should be noted that, as\r\nin all Sharks and Rays, the upper jaw does not correspond with that of\r\nthe higher Vertebrates; and particular attention should be devoted to\r\nthe structure and arrangement of the arches supporting the gills.\r\n\r\nIn the south side of the table-case in this bay are shown a number\r\nof dissections, mounted in spirit, displaying the different types\r\nof skeletal structure presented by the fins in various groups of\r\nFishes. One of the most remarkable of these types occurs in _Ceratodus\r\nforsteri_, the Queensland Lung-fish, in which the skeleton of the fin\r\nconsists of a central jointed rod, from each side of which diverge\r\nnarrower jointed rods. Alongside are specimens showing special\r\nmodifications of certain fins, as in the Flying Fish (fig. 11) and\r\nFlying Gurnard (fig. 12), for the purpose of sustaining the body in the\r\nair, or, as in _Pentanemus_, to serve as organs of touch. Specimens\r\nof the West Indian Goby and the Lump-Sucker show modifications of the\r\npelvic fins in connection with a sucker on the lower surface of the\r\nbody; while other preparations display the pectoral (_Doras_) and\r\npelvic fins (_Monocentris_) reduced to the condition of saw-like spines.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the skull of Fishes is illustrated in another part of\r\nthe same side of this case. From this the visitor may learn how the\r\nprimitive cartilaginous skull of the Sharks (fig. 10), Rays, Chimæras,\r\nand Lung-fishes has been gradually modified, by the addition of\r\nsuperficial sheathing-bones, into the bony skull of modern Fishes, such\r\nas the Cod and Perch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--THE FLYING FISH (_Exocœtus_).\r\n\r\nFIG. 12.--THE FLYING GURNARD (_Dactylopterus_).]\r\n\r\nThe north side of the table-case in bay V is mainly devoted to the\r\ndisplay of the different types of scales, spines, and teeth found\r\namong Fishes. In one corner are the enamelled “ganoid” scales of\r\nthe modern American Bony Pike (_Lepidosteus_) and the African Bichir\r\n(_Polypterus_) alongside those of certain extinct forms. A scale of the\r\nTarpon, or King-of-the-Herrings, illustrates the largest development\r\nin point of size of the modern “cycloid” type. Spines of the\r\nPorcupine-fish show an extreme development of this kind of structure.\r\nDiagrams and spirit-preparations illustrate the mode of attachment and\r\nsuccession of fish-teeth. A large series of the teeth of Sharks and\r\nRays displays the gradual passage from those of the ordinary pointed\r\nform to others arranged in a pavement-like manner and adapted solely\r\nfor crushing. Both types occur in the Port Jackson Shark (fig. 13),\r\nbut those of some Rays are solely of the pavement modification. Very\r\nremarkable is the dental structure in the Parrot-fish. The west end of\r\nthis side of the case shows the various modifications assumed by the\r\nteeth of the modern Bony Fishes; among which, as exemplified by the\r\nWrasse, teeth are developed on the bones of the throat, as well as on\r\nthose of the jaws. Throughout this case specimens, or models, of the\r\nteeth of extinct Fishes are placed side by side with those of their\r\nnearest living relatives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--A JAW OF THE PORT JACKSON SHARK (_Cestracion\r\nphilippi_), showing sharp teeth in front and crushing ones behind.]\r\n\r\nThe wall-case on the north side of this bay shows the history of the\r\ndevelopment of various Fishes, together with the form and structure of\r\nthe gills, brain, heart, digestive system, and other organs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lancelet.]\r\n\r\nA small case affixed to the pillar at the entrance of the fifth\r\nbay illustrates the structure of the Lancelet (_Branchiostoma_, or\r\n_Amphioxus_), by the aid of spirit-specimens, enlarged models, and\r\ncoloured diagrams. One of the most remarkable features in the structure\r\nof this strange and primitive little creature is the outer cavity\r\nenclosing the part of the body which contains the large and complex\r\npharynx. The Lancelet was formerly included among the Fishes, but is\r\nnow accorded the rank of a class (Cephalochorda) to itself.\r\n\r\nLeaving bay VI, next the principal staircase on the east side of\r\nthe central hall, which is devoted to illustrations of heredity,\r\nespecially in relation to the Mendelian theory, and to modes of Flight\r\nin Vertebrates and Insects, we pass on to a table-case assigned to the\r\nillustration of “Mimicry” and kindred phenomena. Most of the examples\r\nshown occur among Insects; but one example among Mammals and a second\r\nin Birds are illustrated. Very striking is a coloured sketch showing a\r\ngroup of red and black caterpillars from Singapore grouped side by side\r\non the stem of a plant so as to present a remarkable similarity to a\r\nsucculent fruit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bay VIII.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bay IX.]\r\n\r\nIn bay VIII, on the eastern side of the central hall, is displayed\r\nan exhibition illustrating trees, native to or grown in Britain. The\r\nwinter and summer states are indicated by photographs, and the foliage,\r\nflowers, fruits, seedlings, and texture of wood and bark by specimens,\r\nmodels, and drawings. Bays IX and X are intended to illustrate the\r\ngeneral characters of the great groups of the Vegetable Kingdom. Bay\r\nIX, in course of arrangement, is devoted to the Cryptogams (Ferns,\r\nMosses, Fungi, Seaweeds, and Lichens).\r\n\r\nAt the back of the bay is a fine polished section of a buttress from\r\nthe base of the Tapang (_Abauria excelsa_), the largest tree in Borneo,\r\nwhich attains a height of 250 feet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bay X. Seed-bearing Plants.]\r\n\r\nThe last bay (No. X) is devoted to the Seed-bearing Plants, which\r\nare characterised by the formation of a seed--the result of the\r\nfertilisation of an ovule by the male cell which is developed in the\r\npollen. The series begins on the left hand side with the Pteridosperms,\r\nan extinct group combining the characters of Ferns and Seed-plants\r\nand forming a link between them. Then follow the Gymnosperms (Cycads,\r\nPines, Firs, etc.), in which the seed is borne naked on an open scale\r\nwhich generally forms, with others like it, the characteristic cone.\r\nCertain points in the development of pollen and ovule recall similar\r\nstages in the Fern group, and indicate that the Gymnosperms stand\r\nnearer to the Cryptogams than do the Angiosperms, the other and larger\r\ngroup of Seed-plants. The Gymnosperms are also the older group, and\r\ncontain many extinct forms. In the Angiosperms the seed is enclosed in\r\nthe fruit, and in the development of pollen and ovule almost all traces\r\nof a cryptogamic ancestry have been lost; the great development of the\r\nflower is a characteristic feature of the Angiosperms. The arrangement\r\nof the vegetative parts of the plant is based on its separation into\r\nroot, stem, and leaf. In the right-hand wall-case the upper series\r\nof specimens illustrates the leaf, its form, veining, direction, the\r\ncharacters of its stalk and stipules, its modification for special\r\npurposes, and its arrangement on the stem and in the bud. Below, the\r\nstem and root are similarly treated, and above are some anatomical\r\ndrawings. The display of the root is continued in the lower part of the\r\nopposite wall-case. In the central case the chief types of the flower\r\nwith its parts, the fruit, and the seed are exhibited.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the bay is a large transverse section of the Karri tree\r\n(_Eucalyptus diversicolor_) of Western Australia, a species which grows\r\nto a height of 400 feet. The tree from which the section was cut was\r\nabout 200 years old when felled.\r\n\r\nThe Introductory Collection of Minerals will be found in the gallery\r\ndevoted to the Mineral Department (see p. 90).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTH HALL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Domesticated Animals,[6] Hybrids, and Economic Zoology.]\r\n\r\nThe North Hall, or that portion of the building situated to the\r\nnorthward of the principal staircase, is used for the exhibition of the\r\nmore important breeds of Domesticated Animals, as well as of examples\r\nof Hybrids and other Abnormalities. A series of specimens illustrative\r\nof Economic Zoology is likewise temporarily placed here.\r\n\r\nThe examples of Domesticated Mammals include Horses, Cattle, Sheep,\r\nGoats, Llamas, Dogs, Cats, and Rabbits. One of the main objects of this\r\nseries is to show the leading characteristics of the well-established\r\nbreeds, both British and foreign. In addition to Domesticated Animals\r\nproperly so called, there are also exhibited examples of what may be\r\ntermed Semi-domesticated Animals, such as white or parti-coloured Rats\r\nand Mice.\r\n\r\nThe skulls and skeletons of celebrated Horses[7] of all breeds,\r\nincluding those of the Thoroughbreds “Persimmon” (presented by His\r\nMajesty King Edward VII.), “Stockwell,” “Bend Or,” and “Ormonde,”\r\nand of the Shire “Blaisdon Conqueror,” form a notable feature of the\r\nseries. In another case is exhibited the dentition of the Horse at\r\ndifferent periods of existence; while on the opposite side of the same\r\nis illustrated the evolution of the Horse from three-toed and four-toed\r\nancestors, and also certain peculiarities distinguishing the skulls of\r\nThoroughbreds and Arabs from those of most other breeds.\r\n\r\nAmong the more notable exhibits are a mounted specimen of a Spanish\r\nFighting Bull, which belongs to an altogether peculiar breed, and heads\r\nof Spanish Draught Cattle, presented by H.M. King Edward VII. Among the\r\nSheep, attention may be directed to the four-horned, fat-tailed, and\r\nfat-rumped breeds, and also to the small breed from the island of Soa,\r\nas well as the curious spiral horned Wallachian Sheep. The so-called\r\nwild cattle of Chillingham Park are included in this series, since\r\nthey are not truly wild animals, but are descended from a domesticated\r\nbreed. The celebrated Greyhound “Fullerton” is shown among the series\r\nof Dogs, which also comprises examples of the Afghan Greyhound, and of\r\nthe Slughi or Arab Greyhound. Small-sized models of Cattle, Horses,\r\nSheep, and Pigs also form a feature of the series.\r\n\r\nA hybrid between the Zebra and the Ass is shown in one of the cases;\r\nwhile photographs illustrate the results of experiments undertaken by\r\nProfessor Ewart in cross-breeding between Burchell’s Zebra and the\r\nHorse. An example of the Lion-Tiger hybrids born many years ago in\r\nAtkins’ menagerie is likewise shown.\r\n\r\nA fine series of hybrid Ducks and hybrid Pheasants is exhibited in the\r\nnorth hall.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Skeletons of Man and Horse.]\r\n\r\nFacing the visitor as he approaches the middle of the north hall are\r\nthe skeletons of a Man and of a Horse, arranged for comparison with\r\neach other, and also to show the position of the bones of both in\r\nrelation to the external surface. In the case of the Horse, the skin\r\nof the same animal from which the skeleton was prepared was carefully\r\nmounted, and, when dry, divided in the middle line; one half, lined\r\nwith velvet, has been placed behind the skeleton. In the case of the\r\nMan, the external surface is shown by a _papier-maché_ model, similarly\r\nlined and placed in a corresponding position. As all the principal\r\nbones of both skeletons have their names attached, a study of this\r\ngroup will not only afford a lesson in comparative anatomy, but be of\r\npractical utility to the artist.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Section of “Big Tree.”]\r\n\r\nAgainst the wall dividing the north hall from the central hall is\r\nplaced a section of a very large Wellingtonia or “Big Tree” (_Sequoia\r\ngigantea_), which was cut down in 1892 near Fresno, in California. It\r\nis about fifteen feet in diameter, and perfectly sound to the centre,\r\nshowing distinctly 1,335 rings of annual growth, which afford exact\r\nevidence of the age of the tree. An instantaneous photograph, taken\r\nwhile the tree was being felled, is placed near by, and shows its\r\ngeneral appearance when living. The height of the tree was 276 feet.\r\n\r\nThe exhibits of Economic Zoology at present occupy the northern\r\ndivision of this hall. In the western wall-case are specimens showing\r\nthe injuries caused to trees by various insects. The table-cases\r\ncontain examples of the damage done in Britain to fruit, roots, corn,\r\nand garden and vegetable produce, with specimens of the insects, and\r\nhints as to methods of destruction. There are also examples of injury\r\ndone by insects abroad to cotton, tea, coffee, etc. In the cases under\r\nthe windows are various parasites affecting man and domesticated\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAIRCASE AND CORRIDORS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Statue of Darwin.]\r\n\r\nOn the first landing of the great staircase, facing the centre of the\r\nhall, is placed the seated marble statue of CHARLES DARWIN (b. 1809, d.\r\n1882), to whose labours the study of natural history owes so vast an\r\nimpulse. The statue was executed by Sir J. E. Boehm, R.A., as part of\r\nthe “Darwin Memorial” raised by public subscription. It was unveiled\r\nand placed under the care of the Trustees of the Museum on the 9th of\r\nJune, 1885, when an address was delivered on behalf of the Memorial\r\nCommittee by the late Professor Huxley, P.R.S., to which His late\r\nMajesty King Edward VII. (then Prince of Wales), as representing the\r\nTrustees, replied.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Statue of Banks.]\r\n\r\nAbove the first landing the staircase divides into two flights, each\r\nleading to one of the corridors which flank the west and east sides of\r\nthe hall and give access to the galleries of the first floor of the\r\nbuilding. Near the southern ends of these corridors two staircases join\r\nto form a central flight leading to the second floor. On the landing at\r\nthe top is a marble statue by Chantrey of SIR JOSEPH BANKS (b. 1743, d.\r\n1820), who for 41 years presided over the Royal Society and was Trustee\r\nof the Museum. His botanical collections are preserved in the adjoining\r\ngallery, but his library of works on natural history, also bequeathed\r\nto the Museum, remains at Bloomsbury, where the statue, erected by\r\npublic subscription in 1826, stood until it was removed to its present\r\nsituation in 1886. On the wall above is displayed a series of unusually\r\nfine heads of Indian Big Game Animals, bequeathed by Mr. A. O. Hume,\r\nC.B., in 1912.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--A FEMALE OKAPI (_Okapia johnstoni_).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: African Antelopes.]\r\n\r\nThe west, south, and east corridors contain a portion of the collection\r\nof mounted Mammals for which there is not room in the gallery\r\nimmediately adjoining. The specimens placed here include a large\r\nnumber of species of the finest African Antelopes, animals remarkable\r\nfor their beauty, for their former countless numbers, and for their\r\nthreatened extermination in consequence of the inroads of civilized man\r\ninto their domain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Giraffes and Okapi.]\r\n\r\nIn a case at the head of the staircase leading to the east corridor are\r\nseveral mounted specimens of Giraffes, and near by a skeleton of the\r\nsame. Alongside the former is placed a case containing the heads and\r\nnecks, together with skulls, of the various local races of Giraffes;\r\nwhile in a third are displayed three specimens of their near ally the\r\nOkapi (fig. 14) of the Congo Forest, as well as a skeleton of the same.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Collections of Humming-Birds.]\r\n\r\nThe collection of Humming-Birds (_Trochilidæ_) arranged and mounted\r\nby the late Mr. John Gould, and purchased for the Museum in 1881,\r\nis principally shown in the vestibule leading from the hall to the\r\nFish-gallery, but a few cases are placed on the pillars of the\r\nstaircase. Another large collection of these birds, presented in 1913\r\nby Mr. E. J. Balston, of Maidstone, is exhibited in the corridor\r\nleading to the Whale-room.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST WING.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the west wing of the building is devoted to the\r\ncollections of recent Zoology.\r\n\r\n\r\n(A) GROUND FLOOR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bird Gallery.[8]]\r\n\r\nThe ground floor is entered from the west side (left hand) of the\r\ncentral hall, near the main entrance of the building. The long gallery,\r\nextending the entire length of the front of the wing as far as the\r\nwest pavilion, is assigned to the exhibited collection of Birds, the\r\nstudy-series of the same group being kept in cabinets in a room behind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Systematic Series in Wall-cases.]\r\n\r\nThe wall-cases contain mounted specimens of all the principal genera,\r\nplaced in systematic order, beginning with the Crows and Birds of\r\nParadise on the left hand on entering, and ending with the Ostriches,\r\nEmus, etc., on the right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITISH MUSEUM (NATURAL HISTORY)\r\n\r\nGround Floor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--THE GREAT AUK OR GARE-FOWL (_Plautus_, or\r\n_Alca_, _impennis_), AND ITS EGG.]\r\n\r\nAmong the multitude of species exhibited in this gallery, which form,\r\nhowever, but a small proportion of the different kinds of Birds known\r\nto inhabit the globe, only a few of the more striking can be mentioned.\r\nThe various types of the Birds-of-Prey are very fully represented:\r\nfrom the Condor of the Andes, the large Sea-Eagle of Bering Strait,\r\nand the Great Eagle-Owl of Europe (all of which are placed in separate\r\ncases), to the Dwarf Falcon in case 53, which is not much larger\r\nthan a sparrow, and preys upon insects. Among the large group of\r\nPerching-Birds, attention may be directed to the cases of Birds of\r\nParadise and Bower-Birds in the first bay on the left. In separate\r\ncases in the sixth bay on the opposite side of the gallery are placed\r\nskeletons of the Dodo and Solitaire, large Pigeon-like birds with wings\r\ntoo small for flight, once inhabiting the islands of Mauritius and\r\nRodriguez, respectively, but now extinct. Other cases on the right-hand\r\nside of the gallery are occupied by the Game-Birds, and the Wading and\r\nSwimming Birds. Here may be noticed a nearly complete series of the\r\ngenera of Pheasants and Pigeons, showing the various forms. Special\r\nattention may be directed to the Great Auk (fig. 15), from the Northern\r\nAtlantic, which became extinct only in the last century. Casts of the\r\neggs (fig. 16) of this curious bird are also exhibited. A case in the\r\n7th bay contains a series of Penguins, flightless birds which may\r\nbe regarded as representing the northern Auks and Guillemots in the\r\nsouthern oceans. Particularly interesting is the great Emperor Penguin,\r\nwhich lays its eggs and rears its young in winter amidst the ice of the\r\nAntarctic. Most of the specimens exhibited were obtained during the\r\nBritish Antarctic Expedition of 1839–43, under the command of Captain\r\nSir James Clark Ross.\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy types are the Great Bustard, once an inhabitant of\r\nEngland, and the Flamingos; a pair of the latter being exhibited with\r\ntheir nest.\r\n\r\nIn the first two bays on the right side of the gallery are placed\r\nspecimens of the Ostrich group, characterised by the flat or raft-like\r\nform of the breast-bone. Owing to the rudimentary character of their\r\nwings, these Birds lack the power of flight. They include the largest\r\nexisting Birds, the Ostriches, Emus, and Cassowaries, as well as the\r\nsmall Kiwis (_Apteryx_) of New Zealand, together with the extinct Moas\r\n(_Dinornis_, etc.), of the same country, and the Roc (_Æpyornis_) of\r\nMadagascar. A fossil egg of the latter is placed alongside eggs of the\r\nexisting species of the group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--EGG OF THE GREAT AUK OR GARE-FOWL: Size of\r\nnature.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Groups of British Birds and Nests.]\r\n\r\nDown the middle line of the gallery, as well as in many of the bays,\r\nare placed groups showing the nesting-habits of various species of\r\nBritish birds. The great value of these groups consists in their\r\nabsolute truthfulness to nature. The surroundings are not selected by\r\nchance or from imagination, but in every case are carefully executed\r\nreproductions of those that were present round the individual nest.\r\nWhen it has been possible, the actual rocks, trees, or grass, have\r\nbeen preserved, but in cases where these could not be used, they have\r\nbeen accurately modelled from nature. Great care has also been taken\r\nin preserving the natural form and characteristic attitudes of the\r\nBirds themselves. Among the more attractive cases are, near the centre\r\nof the gallery, a pair of Puffins feeding their single young one, and\r\nBlack-throated Divers with their eggs in a hollow in the grass on\r\nthe edge of a mountain-loch in Sutherland. Hen-harriers--the male grey\r\nand the female brown--are shown with their nest among the heather from\r\nthe moorland of the same county. On the left of these is a Peregrine\r\nFalcon’s eyrie, on the ledge of a rocky cliff, containing three white\r\ndowny nestlings. Near by are various species of Ducks, notably the\r\nRed-headed Pochard on the sedgy border of a Norfolk mere. In the last\r\nbay but one on the right side is a nest of the Heron, in a fir-tree,\r\nwith the two old birds and three nearly fledged young. Various species\r\nof Gulls and a particularly beautiful group of Arctic Terns from the\r\nShetland Islands are exhibited in the middle line towards the west end\r\nof the gallery and in the eighth and ninth bays. In the eighth bay on\r\nthe right side and in the adjoining passage are Plovers, Sandpipers,\r\nSnipes, etc., some of which (especially the Ringed and Kentish Plovers)\r\nshow the wonderful adaptation of the colouring of the eggs and young\r\nbirds to their natural surroundings for the purpose of concealment.\r\nIn the second passage leading to the Coral-gallery are Ptarmigan and\r\nCapercaillie from Scotland, and in the adjacent part of the middle\r\nline Wood-Pigeons and Turtle-Doves building their simple, flat nests\r\nof sticks in ivy-clad trees. In the fourth, sixth and seventh bays\r\non the left are Sand-Martins and Kingfishers, showing, by means of\r\nsections of the banks of sand or earth, the form and depth of the hole\r\nin which the eggs are placed; and also nests of the Swift, Swallow, and\r\nHouse-Martin, all in portions of human habitations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pavilion, with British Land and Fresh-water Vertebrates.[9]]\r\n\r\nThe “pavilion” at the west end of the Bird-gallery is devoted to the\r\nexhibition of the land and fresh-water Vertebrated Animals of the\r\nBritish Islands. The larger Mammals and Fishes occupy the wall-case on\r\nthe north side, which is surmounted with horns. In the two pairs of\r\ncentre cases is exhibited the series of British Birds, supplemented by\r\nthe groups, to which reference has been made already. The wall-case on\r\nthe north side of the archway contains a group of Gannets and other\r\nsea-birds from the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth. On the opposite\r\nside are two striking groups with the surroundings true to nature,\r\nthe one of the Golden Eagle and the other of the Buzzard, both taken\r\nin Scotland. Other groups in the pavilion display the Kestrel, the\r\nPeregrine Falcon, and the Merlin amid natural surroundings. Among the\r\nMammals, especial attention may be directed to a case of British Hares\r\nand Rabbits. In another case may be seen a female Badger and her young;\r\nin a third is a group of Otters; in a fourth a vixen Fox with her cubs;\r\nin a fifth a Mole-hill with its inhabitants; in a sixth a pair of\r\nMartens; in a seventh Polecats and their young; while other cases are\r\ndevoted to Stoats, Weasels, Hedgehogs, Squirrels, Rats, Mice, etc.\r\n\r\nHere it may be mentioned that the animal inhabitants of any country or\r\ndistrict are collectively termed its “_fauna_.” The British Islands in\r\nthis respect belong to the great zoological region called Palæarctic,\r\nor Eastern Holarctic, embracing all Europe, the north of Africa,\r\nand the western and northern portions of Asia. As in the case of\r\nother islands, the species belonging to groups in which the power of\r\nlocomotion is limited to land or fresh-water are not numerous compared\r\nwith those inhabiting large continental tracts. Their numbers can\r\nonly increase under exceptional circumstances, and have a tendency to\r\ndiminish as the growth of human population and increase of the area of\r\ncultivated land gradually reduce their native haunts. In this way the\r\nBrown Bear, the Wolf, the Beaver, and the Wild Boar have disappeared\r\nfrom Britain within the historic period, while other species, such\r\nas the Badger, Marten, and Wild Cat, with difficulty maintain a more\r\nor less precarious existence. All these were originally derived from\r\nthe mainland of Europe, probably before the formation of the channel\r\nwhich now separates it from Great Britain. The wider and older channel\r\nwhich separates Ireland from Great Britain has been a greater barrier\r\nto the emigration of animal life than that between the latter and the\r\nContinent, many species (as the Polecat, Wild Cat, Mole, Squirrel,\r\nDormouse, Harvest-Mouse, Water-Rat, Short-tailed Field-Mouse, Brown\r\nHare, Roedeer, as well as Snakes and Toads) never having crossed what\r\nis now the Irish Sea, unless by human agency.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those species that have the power of travelling\r\nthrough the air or traversing the ocean are far less fixed in their\r\nhabitat; and it results from this that the list of so-called “British\r\nBirds” receives accessions from time to time from stragglers which\r\nfind their way from the European continent or Asia, or even across the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nSlight but permanent variations from the continental type may be\r\nrecognised in many native British species, some of the most marked\r\namong vertebrated animals being the Irish Stoat, the Squirrel, the Red\r\nGrouse, the St. Kilda Wren, the Coal-Tit, the Goldcrest, and several\r\nspecies of fresh-water fishes, mostly belonging to the genera _Salmo_\r\nand _Coregonus_. Some of the latter, such as the Vendace, the Gwyniad,\r\nand their allies, of which specimens are exhibited in the wall-case in\r\nthe pavilion, have an extremely local distribution, being found only in\r\ncertain small groups of mountain lakes.\r\n\r\nOf the Seals, only two species are really natives of Britain, the\r\nCommon Seal (_Phoca vitulina_) and the great Grey Seal (_Halichœrus\r\ngrypus_); specimens of both these are shown in the pavilion.\r\n\r\nThose desirous of studying more minutely the characteristics of British\r\nMammals should examine the series of skins and skulls exhibited in a\r\nspecial case on the right side of the central west window.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coral Gallery.[10]]\r\n\r\nParallel with the Bird-gallery, on the north side (right on entering),\r\nand approached by several passages, is a long narrow gallery containing\r\nthe collection of Corals and Sponges and allied types. Commencing\r\nat the eastern end, some of the lowest forms of animal life are\r\nexhibited in the wall-case and table-cases; they belong to a group\r\ncalled PROTOZOA, and, for the greater part, are so minute, that they\r\ncan be studied only with the microscope; their structure is therefore\r\nillustrated chiefly by means of models and figures. The next divisions\r\nof the gallery are occupied by the Sponges, most conspicuous among\r\nthese being a series showing the variations of the common Bath-Sponge\r\n(cases 1 and 2), the beautiful flinty Venus’ Flower-basket or\r\n_Euplectella_ (fig. 17), the Japanese Glass-rope Sponge or _Hyalonema_\r\n(case 3), and the gigantic Neptune’s Cup or _Poterion_, of which\r\nseveral specimens are placed on separate stands. Special interest\r\nattaches to the case showing the different kinds of Sponges used in\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--VENUS’ FLOWER-BASKET (_Euplectella imperialis_\r\nand _E. aspergillum_). (One-sixth natural size.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--BRAIN-CORAL. (_Meandrina cerebriformis_).]\r\n\r\nNearly the whole of the remainder of the gallery is given up to Corals.\r\nIn life these organisms display an immense variety of form and colour,\r\nsometimes presenting a marvellous resemblance to vegetable growths; but\r\nthe part exhibited in the gallery is merely the dried, hard, horny, or\r\nstony basis or supporting skeleton, either of isolated individuals, or\r\nof colonies. Corals are allied to the well-known Sea-anemones of the\r\nBritish and other coasts; the combined skeletons of myriads of these\r\nanimals form the coral-reefs which constitute the bases of thousands\r\nof islands in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Among the larger reef-making\r\nspecies are the Brain-Corals (_Meandrina_), one of which is shown in\r\nfigure 18. Near the west end of the gallery is placed a magnificent\r\nspecimen of the Black Coral of the Mediterranean (_Gerardia savalia_),\r\nobtained off the coast of the island of Eubœa in the Ægean Sea. The\r\ndrawing in the case shows a magnified view of the “animals” or polyps\r\nof this species as they appear in life. In case 13 are specimens\r\nand drawings of the Red Coral (_Corallium rubrum_), so largely used\r\nfor ornamental purposes, and also of the crimson Organ-pipe Coral\r\n(_Tubipora musica_). Arranged on shelves on the south wall of the\r\nwestern end of this gallery is a series of _Pennatulidæ_ (Sea-pens,\r\nSea-rushes, or Sea-ropes) preserved in spirit. These Zoophytes live at\r\nthe bottom of the sea, with their lower ends fixed in the sand and mud;\r\nthe skeleton being never more than a straight internal rod in addition\r\nto innumerable microscopic spicules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--ROUGH SUNFISH (_Orthagoriscus mola_).]\r\n\r\nApproached through the Coral-gallery, and running backwards at right\r\nangles with it, are several galleries containing other portions of the\r\nzoological collections.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fish Gallery.[11]]\r\n\r\nI. The Fish-gallery is nearest to the central hall, and contains the\r\nexhibited portion of the collection of Fishes. The greater number of\r\nspecimens, preserved in spirit, are, however, placed for safety in a\r\ndetached building outside the Museum, where they are available for\r\nstudy under special regulations. The gallery contains mounted examples,\r\nmodels, and skeletons of many of the more remarkable members of the\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 20 & 21.--TWO DEEP-SEA FISHES (_a. Gastrostomus\r\nbairdi_ and _b. Saccopharynx flagellum_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--SUCKER-FISH (_Echeneis remora_).]\r\n\r\nThe wall-cases on the east side of the gallery (right on entering)\r\ncontain the fishes with completely bony skeletons (Teleostei); to which\r\ndivision belong by far the greater part of the species now inhabiting\r\nthe waters of the globe. Large and remarkable examples are placed in\r\nseparate cases opposite to the wall-cases. As the colours of fishes\r\nare very fugitive, and disappear more or less completely after death,\r\nmost of the mounted examples have been painted. The fishes allied to\r\nthe Perch, Gurnard, Mackerel, Sword-Fish, Wrasse, Cod, Plaice, Catfish,\r\nSalmon, Pike, and Eel are represented by numerous examples. Specially\r\nnoticeable, so far as size and external form are concerned, are the\r\nSunfishes, _Orthagoriscus_ (fig. 19).\r\n\r\nEven more strange are several of the species of deep-sea Fishes\r\nexhibited in a table-case in the Fish-gallery, which live at depths\r\nwhere the sun’s rays cannot penetrate, and many of which are\r\nself-luminous. Two deep-sea Fishes are shown in the accompanying\r\nillustrations (figs. 20 and 21). From another point of view, special\r\nattention may be given to the Sucker-Fish or Remora (_Echeneis\r\nremora_), fig. 22, which attaches itself by the sucker on the top of\r\nits head to the bodies of Fishes or Turtles, or to the bottom of ships.\r\nAs it attaches itself back-downwards, the under-parts are coloured dark\r\nwhile the back is light; a condition just the reverse of that obtaining\r\nin ordinary Fishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--LOWER VIEW OF THE HEAD OF A SAW-FISH.\r\n(_Pristis antiquorum._)]\r\n\r\nThe western or left side of the gallery is devoted to the exhibition of\r\ncertain very different types of Fishes, which were much more numerously\r\nrepresented in ancient times than at present. The majority have a\r\ncartilaginous skeleton. Among these may be specially mentioned the\r\nBichir of the tropical African rivers, the Gar-Pike of North America,\r\nthe Sturgeons, the Lung-Fishes (Dipnoi) of South America, Africa, and\r\nAustralia, the Chimæras, and finally the Sharks and Rays. Among the\r\ntwo latter are included the singular Hammer-headed Shark (_Zygœna_),\r\nand the Saw-Fishes (_Pristis_), which have long projecting flattened\r\nsnouts, with a row of teeth arranged something like those of a saw on\r\neach side (fig. 23). A remarkably large specimen from the coast of\r\nBritish Guiana of a species of this group (_Pristis perrotteti_) is\r\nexhibited. Another very small division of Fishes comprises the Lampreys\r\nand Hags, of which a few specimens are shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--THE BASKING SHARK (_Selache maxima_).]\r\n\r\nThe largest exhibited specimen of the class is the head of a full-grown\r\nexample of the great Basking Shark (_Selache_, or _Cetorhinus,\r\nmaxima_), fig. 24, captured on the 2nd of March, 1875, near Shanklin,\r\nin the Isle of Wight. The length of the entire specimen was\r\ntwenty-eight feet, but, as the minute size of the teeth indicates,\r\nit is a comparatively harmless fish. A smaller female specimen is\r\nsuspended from the roof; and below this is placed a model of the\r\nskeleton of the same species. Near by is a young specimen of another\r\nbasking species, the Elephant-Shark (_Rhinodon typicus_), which when\r\nadult is said to attain a length of at least fifty feet. It inhabits\r\nthe Indian and Pacific Oceans.\r\n\r\nModels of some of the more remarkable types of extinct Fishes are\r\nexhibited in cases on the same side of the gallery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Insect Gallery.[12]]\r\n\r\nII. A small gallery is devoted to the group of Arthropoda or\r\nInvertebrate animals with jointed limbs, such as Lobsters, Crabs,\r\nSpiders, Centipedes, and Insects.\r\n\r\nAt the south end of this gallery are exhibited specimens of Crabs and\r\nLobsters. Among the former, special attention may be directed to the\r\nspecimens of the Giant Crab (_Macrocheira_) of Japan, and also to the\r\nCoconut Crab (_Birgus latro_), fig. 25, which climbs trees to feed on\r\nyoung cocoanuts, and is related to the Hermit-Crabs. In the central\r\ntable-cases, besides Crustacea (Crabs, Lobsters, etc.), are displayed\r\nrepresentative Scorpions and Spiders, including several examples of the\r\nlarge Bird-eating Spiders of South America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--THE COCONUT CRAB (_Birgus latro_)].\r\n\r\nThe northern half of this gallery is devoted to the exhibited series of\r\nInsects. Next to the door on the east side are the nests of White Ants\r\nor Termites, while on the opposite side are some remarkable cocoons of\r\nsocial Caterpillars of various Moths, and also a series of preparations\r\nshowing the metamorphoses or changes undergone by Insects as they grow\r\nto maturity. At the sides of the gallery are models of various galls,\r\nwith drawings of the insects which cause them; and others showing\r\nthe life-histories of certain Beetles, Bees, and Moths. Beneath a\r\nshelf, on the west side, are four cabinets containing a collection of\r\nBritish Butterflies and Moths with their caterpillars, prepared and\r\npresented by Lord Walsingham; and near by stands a cabinet containing a\r\ncollection of the Butterflies and Moths of the British islands formed\r\nby the late Mr. William Buckler, most of the specimens in which were\r\nbred by him during the preparation of his “Larvæ of British Butterflies\r\nand Moths.” Above these are maps illustrating the geographical\r\ndistribution of certain Beetles (_Calosoma_, _Carabus_, _Julodis_\r\nand _Stigmodera_); actual specimens of the insects being placed in\r\nposition on the maps. The wall-cases at the end of the gallery are\r\ndevoted exclusively to the nests of Ants, Wasps, and Bees. On the east\r\nwall is a large case containing specimens and drawings explaining the\r\nstructure of Insects. On the west side, next the Walsingham collection,\r\nare cabinets containing a selection of British Insects. Lower down are\r\nother cabinets in the series of foreign Butterflies; while foreign\r\nMoths and other Insects are arranged in adjacent cabinets. In another\r\npart of the gallery are exhibited coloured drawings of a few of the\r\nsmallest Insects known, namely the _Mymaridæ_, a group of minute\r\nparasitic Hymenoptera; and above is a drawing of a House-Fly, enlarged\r\nin the same proportion--thirty diameters--to show the contrast. A few\r\nspecimens of the insects themselves are placed in the microscope below.\r\n\r\nIn the table-cases in the middle of the gallery are specimens and\r\nillustrations of some of the principal families of Insects, with\r\nexplanations of the characters by which these may be recognised. The\r\nfirst case (next to the west door) contains an introductory series, and\r\nthen follow the various orders in sequence commencing with the most\r\nprimitive forms or Aptera, among which _Campodea_, a small British\r\ninsect, may be specially noticed.\r\n\r\nThe classification of Butterflies, Bees and Ants, and Beetles is shown\r\nin the last three cases; and attention may be specially directed to a\r\nseries of drawings illustrating the transformations of Fleas, Gnats,\r\nMidges, etc.\r\n\r\nThe main collection of insects is kept in cabinets in the “Insect\r\nRoom” in the basement, but is open to students under the regulations\r\nmentioned at the end of this guide.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reptile Gallery.[13]]\r\n\r\nIII. The long Reptile-gallery contains mounted specimens and skeletons\r\nof Reptiles, including Crocodiles, Lizards, Snakes, and Tortoises,\r\nas well as restorations or casts of the remains of many groups now\r\nentirely extinct. The most noticeable specimen in this gallery is the\r\nmodel of the skeleton of the gigantic extinct North American land\r\nReptile known as _Diplodocus carnegii_, which measures over eighty feet\r\nin length, and was presented by Mr. Andrew Carnegie in 1905. Restored\r\nmodels of the skeletons of the Iguanodon, a British Dinosaur, and of\r\nthe North American Horned Dinosaur (_Triceratops_) are also noteworthy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--SADDLE-BACKED TORTOISE (_Testudo abingdoni_),\r\nOF ABINGDON ISLAND, GALAPAGOS GROUP.]\r\n\r\nThe Crocodiles and their extinct relatives occupy the cases on the\r\nleft of the entrance from the Bird-gallery and also a stand in the\r\nmiddle of the gallery; and among these may be specially noticed the\r\nIndian Gharial, of which both the skeleton and skin are exhibited.\r\nThe two small cases on each side of the west doorway are occupied by\r\nextinct forms and the peculiar Tuatera Lizard of New Zealand. At the\r\nsouth end of the east side are arranged the Turtles and Tortoises,\r\nincluding examples of the Giant Tortoises of the Galapagos (fig. 26)\r\nand Mascarene Islands, as well as a large species (_Testudo calcarata_)\r\nfrom North Africa. Opposite the Turtles and Tortoises are the Snakes,\r\namong which two large Pythons, coloured to nature, form attractive\r\nexhibits. Extinct groups occupy a small case on each side of the east\r\ndoor. Beyond these come the Lizards, which occupy the cases opposite\r\nthe Crocodiles. The series of Old World Monitor Lizards and American\r\nIguanas is specially noteworthy; and attention may be likewise directed\r\nto the curious worm-like Amphisbænas, of which the majority inhabit\r\nTropical America. Casts of remains of the extinct marine Ichthyosaurs\r\nand Plesiosaurs are shown in the small cases on the sides of the\r\ndoorway in the east wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--THE HORNED FROG (_Ceratophrys cornutus_) OF\r\nBRAZIL.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amphibians (Salamanders and Frogs).]\r\n\r\nIn the Reptile-gallery is placed a large table-case containing a\r\nselection of the more important forms of Amphibians, which are divided\r\ninto such as possess a tail:--Salamanders and Newts; and those without\r\ntails:--Frogs and Toads. During some period of their existence most\r\nof these animals live in the water, when they breathe by gills, and\r\nare in this respect akin to Fishes. The comparatively enormous size\r\nattained by certain tropical species of Frogs and Toads, such as the\r\nSouth American Horned Frog (fig. 27), should be noticed. The largest\r\nrepresentative of the group is the Giant Salamander of Japan and China.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--A SEA-LILY, THE LARVAL STAGE OF THE ROSY\r\nFEATHER-STAR. (_Antedon rosacea_), much magnified. _a_, arms; _b_,\r\nbasals; _r_, radials; _s_, stalk.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Starfish Gallery.[14]]\r\n\r\nIV. A small gallery is devoted to Starfishes and their allies\r\ncollectively constituting the class ECHINODERMA. Specimens of these\r\nare arranged systematically in table-cases 1–24; and in case 36 are\r\nspecimens illustrating the anatomy of the skeleton, and models and\r\nfigures showing the remarkable changes undergone by these animals in\r\nthe course of their development. In a separate case on the east side\r\nof the gallery is a case containing specimens of a large Starfish to\r\nillustrate the variability in the number of rays from 4 to 7. In a\r\ncase on the opposite side is shown _Luidia savignei_ from Mauritius,\r\none of the largest of Starfishes. The Feather-stars (_Antedon_) are\r\nalso members of this group; but the most beautiful and remarkable\r\nspecimens in the gallery are the Sea-Lilies, or Crinoids, collected by\r\nthe “Challenger” Expedition. One specimen was found attached to an old\r\ntelegraph-wire taken up in the Caribbean Sea. These deep-sea Crinoids,\r\nof which representatives, now extinct, were abundant in earlier periods\r\nof the world’s history, are exhibited on tables in the corners of\r\nthe gallery, by cases 37 and 38. Some of the larval stages of the\r\nFeather-stars (fig. 28) resemble stalked Crinoids.\r\n\r\nThe wall-cases contain representatives of the groups collectively known\r\nas Worms. Case 1 contains the Tape-Worms or Cestoda, and the Flukes\r\nor Trematoda, the life-history of a species of each being illustrated\r\nby specimens, figures, and models. In case 2 the Round-Worms are\r\nillustrated by models of _Trichina_, and the anatomical structure of\r\nvarious other kinds is shown by the aid of diagrams. Case 3 contains\r\nspecimens of free-living terrestrial and marine Worms, Leeches, and\r\nGephyreans. Case 4 is devoted to specimens of Echinoderms preserved in\r\nspirit, especially Holothurians, such as Trepangs or Sea-Cucumbers, the\r\nBêche-de-Mer of the French.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shell Gallery.[15]]\r\n\r\nV. A large gallery is devoted to the great group of Shell-fish or\r\nMOLLUSCA, the exhibition of which is, however, mainly restricted to\r\ntheir shells. In some cases the form of the soft parts is, however,\r\nshown either by specimens in spirit or by means of models.\r\n\r\nIn wall-cases on the west side of the gallery is a series of shells\r\narranged on tablets to show the leading structural types, such as\r\nunivalve, bivalve, multivalve, etc.; then the nature of the outer\r\ncoat, or “skin”; and, thirdly, some of the more striking styles of\r\nornamentation and colouring. Following these, a division is devoted\r\nto the display of the general form of the shells of bivalves, special\r\nattention being directed to the nature of the hinge by which the two\r\nvalves are joined. Fresh-water Mussels (_Unionidæ_) are selected as\r\nexamples of great variability in the form of the shell in closely\r\nallied species. Near by is a small series of the shells of boring\r\nbivalves, many in the various substances they perforate. Alongside are\r\nshown in a similar manner modifications in form and structure presented\r\nby Univalve or Gastropod shells; many of the shells having been cut\r\nto show their internal structure. Specimens of the horny or shelly\r\nplate (operculum) closing the mouth of many Gastropod shells are also\r\nexhibited. In one compartment are displayed spirit-preparations of\r\nCephalopod Molluscs, such as Octopus, Cuttle-fish, Squids, Nautilus,\r\nArgonaut or Paper-Nautilus, etc. Specimens of the horny beaks possessed\r\nby all members of this class are also exhibited; and a Pearly Nautilus\r\n(fig. 31), with the shell cut in two in order to show the air-chambers\r\nand the comparatively small space occupied by the “animal,” will be\r\nfound of special interest. From the roof are suspended life-sized\r\nmodels of a Giant Squid (_Architenthis_) and a Giant Octopus. The\r\nCephalopods were extraordinarily numerous in past ages, and many of the\r\nfossil forms are exhibited in the Geological Department.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--THE WHELK (_Buocinum undatum_), a Gastropod\r\nMollusc. _a_, siphon; _b_, foot; _c_, tentacles; _d_, eyes; _e_,\r\noperculum.]\r\n\r\nThe main shell-collection is contained in four parallel rows of\r\ntable-cases, the arrangement commencing on the right as the gallery is\r\nentered. The first two rows contain the marine forms of Gastropods--a\r\ndivision which includes Snails, Slugs, Whelks (fig. 29), and all\r\nthose Molluscs which crawl upon the under surface of their bodies;\r\nthe Cowries, Cones, Volutes, Mitras, and Murexes forming some of the\r\nmost attractive groups. The two rows of cases on the left contain\r\nLand-Shells, Bivalves, and Cephalopods. The Cockles, Oysters, Clams,\r\nPiddocks, Teredos, Scallops, and Ark-Shells represent some of the\r\nprincipal types of Bivalves, so called on account of their shells being\r\nformed of two pieces or valves. A Giant Clam (fig. 30), at the S. end\r\nof the gallery, weighs 310 lbs., and measures 36 inches in length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--LEFT VALVE OF THE GIANT CLAM (_Tridacna\r\ngigantea_), a Bivalve Mollusc.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--THE PEARLY NAUTILUS (_Nautilus pompilius_).\r\n_a_, body; _b_, funnel; _c_, eye; _d_, hood; _e_, tentacles; _f_,\r\nmuscle of attachment to the shell; _g_, siphuncle.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sea-Mats, Lamp-shells, and Sea-squirts.]\r\n\r\nIn the same gallery are exhibited examples of three other groups of\r\nmarine organisms, respectively known as Polyzoa, Brachiopoda, and\r\nTunicata. The Polyzoa live in colonies, and include the so-called\r\nSea-Mat. They are often mistaken for sea-weeds, although in reality\r\nthey are animals of comparatively high organisation. The Brachiopods\r\nhave two shells like Bivalve Molluscs, but the valves are dorsal and\r\nventral--that is to say, back and front--instead of right and left.\r\nOne valve is frequently perforated, hence the name of “Lamp-shells,”\r\nfrom a resemblance to an ancient Roman lamp. Sea-squirts, Tunicates,\r\nor Ascidians, are worthy of the attention of the visitor on account of\r\ntheir affinity with the Vertebrate stock, of which they may be regarded\r\nas a degenerate type. It is in the larvæ or “Ascidian Tadpoles” that\r\nthe evidence of Vertebrate relationship is most conspicuous, as shown\r\nby certain important characters in the nervous system, skeleton, and\r\nrespiratory organs.\r\n\r\nA series of large shells occupies some of the space in the wall-cases,\r\namong which attention may be directed to the thick and often handsomely\r\ncoloured Helmet-shells (_Cassis_), which, together with the pink\r\nQueen-conch (_Strombus_), were formerly largely used in the now nearly\r\nobsolete art of cameo-cutting. In addition to these, a selection\r\nof British shells, and series of the eggs of Molluscs, as well as\r\nspecimens illustrating the formation of pearls, and other points\r\nof special interest connected with Molluscs, are displayed. These\r\nspecimens include not only the Pearl-oyster, but some of the other\r\nshells used in the mother-of-pearl trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHALE-ROOM.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Whale-Room.]\r\n\r\nApproached by a staircase, leading down from the last (or western-most)\r\nof the passages which connect the Bird-gallery with the Coral-gallery,\r\nis a separate room in which are placed the specimens of Whales and\r\ntheir relatives. For these, on account of their large size, no other\r\nplace could be found in the Museum; but the room has, unfortunately,\r\nthe disadvantage of being too small to display such large animals to\r\nfull advantage. It is also intersected by columns, which interfere with\r\nthe complete view of the larger specimens.\r\n\r\nAs it is almost impracticable to preserve the skins of the larger\r\nspecies of Whales, owing to the oil with which they are saturated, the\r\nexhibition of the characters of these animals is carried out by means\r\nof their skeletons and artificial models of one side of the body.\r\nComplete models, which are much better than actual skins, of many of\r\nthe smaller kinds, are shown. A general account of the structure and\r\nclassification of the Cetacea, as Whales are technically termed,\r\nwith reference to those exhibited in this gallery, will be found in a\r\nSpecial Guide.[16]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fresh-water Dolphins.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Narwhal.]\r\n\r\nOn the left side of the entrance is a case containing a stuffed\r\nspecimen, a skeleton, and several skulls of the Susu, or Fresh-water\r\nDolphin (_Platanista gangetica_) of the rivers of India, and also of\r\nthe Dolphins of the Rio de la Plata (_Pontoporia blainvillei_) and of\r\nthe River Amazon (_Inia geoffroyensis_). Among the specimens fronting\r\nthe visitor as he enters the room, one of the most interesting, on\r\naccount of its remarkable dentition, is the Narwhal, or Sea-Unicorn.\r\nIt has only two teeth, which lie horizontally in the upper jaw. In the\r\nfemale both remain permanently concealed within the bone of the jaw,\r\nso that this sex is practically toothless; but in the male, while the\r\nright tooth remains similarly concealed and rudimentary (as shown in\r\nthe specimen, by removal of part of the bone which covered it), the\r\nleft is immensely developed, attaining a length equal to that of half\r\nthe entire animal, and projecting horizontally from the head in the\r\nform of a long, straight, tapering and pointed tusk, spirally grooved\r\non the surface. In rare cases, as in the skull exhibited near the\r\nskeleton, both teeth are fully developed, and it is noticeable that in\r\nsuch specimens the direction of the spiral is the same in both tusks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sperm-Whale.]\r\n\r\nTo the right of the entrance is placed a specimen of the bony framework\r\nof one of the most colossal of animals, the Cachalot, or Sperm-Whale\r\n(_Physeter macrocephalus_), fig. 32, prepared from an old male cast\r\nashore near Thurso, on the north coast of Scotland, in July, 1863, on\r\nthe estate of Captain D. Macdonald, R.E., by whom it was presented to\r\nthe Museum. Upon one side of this skeleton has been built the model\r\nof the external form of the animal. The Sperm-Whale is the principal\r\nsource of supply of sperm-oil and spermaceti: the former being obtained\r\nby boiling the fat or blubber lying beneath the skin over the whole\r\nbody. The latter, in a liquid state at the ordinary temperature of the\r\nliving animal, is contained in cells which fill the immense cavity on\r\nthe top of the skull. This Whale, which feeds chiefly on Cephalopods\r\n(Squids and Cuttle-fishes), but also on Fishes, is distributed\r\nthroughout the warm and temperate regions of the Atlantic and Pacific\r\nOceans, and sometimes enters British waters.\r\n\r\nIn order to render this skeleton more instructive, the names have been\r\nattached to the principal bones, thus enabling the visitor to trace at\r\na glance the extraordinary modification from the normal mammalian form\r\nthe huge skull of this species has undergone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--AN OLD MALE SPERM-WHALE OR CACHALOT. Skeleton\r\nand outline of animal: _b_, nostril or blowhole; _p_, rudimentary\r\npelvic bone. Length of specimen 54 feet.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Whalebone Whales.]\r\n\r\nMost of the largest Cetacea belong to the group called “Whalebone\r\nWhales,” in which a series of horny plates termed “whalebone” grow\r\nfrom the palate in place of teeth, and serve to strain the water taken\r\ninto the mouth from the small marine animals on which these Whales\r\nsubsist. A representative of this group is the skeleton of the Common\r\nRorqual or Fin-Whale (_Balænoptera musculus_) in the south-west portion\r\nof the room. This Whale, which is sixty-eight feet long, was captured\r\nin 1882 in the Moray Firth, Scotland. The flukes of the tail and the\r\nback-fin were preserved with the skeleton and are placed above the\r\nwall-case behind; the small pelvic bones, and a rudimentary nodule\r\nrepresenting the femur or thigh-bone, the only trace of the hind leg\r\nof this gigantic animal, are also shown. The external form is modelled\r\nin plaster. In front is a skeleton and half-model of the Black or\r\nNorth Atlantic Right-Whale (_Balæna glacialis_ or _biscayensis_).\r\nBelow this skeleton is placed a lower jaw of the Greenland Right-Whale\r\n(_Balæna mysticetus_), the species which formerly yielded most of the\r\n“whalebone” of commerce, and also a miniature wooden model of the\r\nentire animal, on the scale of one inch to the foot.\r\n\r\nRemains of extinct Cetaceans--notably the solid bony beaks of the\r\nskulls of Beaked Whales (_Ziphiidæ_) from the Red Crag of the east\r\ncoast of England--are placed in this gallery. A special table-case,\r\nnear the Sperm-Whale, shows the curious ear-bones of various Cetaceans,\r\nboth recent and fossil. These bones are perfectly sufficient for the\r\nidentification of the kind of Whale from which they were taken. In\r\na case on the opposite side of the gallery is displayed the horny\r\nwart, termed by sailors the “bonnet,” found on the nose of the Black\r\nRight-Whale.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST FLOOR.\r\n\r\nThe upper floors of the wings of the Museum consist merely of single\r\ngalleries extending along the whole front of the building; for the\r\ngalleries which run backwards on the ground floor form only a single\r\nstorey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITISH MUSEUM (NATURAL HISTORY).\r\n\r\nFirst Floor.\r\n\r\nSecond Floor.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lower Mammal Gallery.]\r\n\r\nThe Lower Mammal-Gallery is entered from the western corridor of\r\nthe central hall. Together with the adjacent corridor, it contains\r\nthe greater part of the exhibited series of recent Mammals, with\r\nthe exception of the Cetacea, Sirenia, and Proboscidea, which are\r\ndownstairs, and the orders Primates, Chiroptera, Insectivora, and\r\nRodentia, which are in the upper gallery. As three special guides[17]\r\nare devoted to these galleries, a very brief notice will serve on\r\nthis occasion. Both stuffed specimens and skulls and skeletons are\r\nexhibited, although the former constitute by far the greater portion of\r\nthe series. A few remains of extinct types, or plaster reproductions\r\nof the same, are introduced here and there; and photographs of\r\nliving animals are hung on the walls, where will also be found some\r\ninstructive series showing the modifications assumed by the teeth\r\nof certain groups. Wherever possible, the horns and antlers of the\r\nRuminants, as well as the horns of the Rhinoceroses, are placed in\r\njuxtaposition to the animals to which they respectively belong.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--THE PLATYPUS OR DUCK-BILL (_Ornithorhynchus\r\nanatinus_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--THE YELLOW-BELLIED PANGOLIN (_Manis\r\ntricuspis_) in a characteristic attitude.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ruminants, etc.]\r\n\r\nThe series commences on the right side of the gallery with the lowest\r\nforms. Down the middle is a row of large Mammals, comprising various\r\nDeer, Seals, and Rhinoceroses. On the right of the entrance a small\r\ncase contains the Australian Platypus or Duck-bill (fig. 33) and the\r\nEchidnas of Australia and New Guinea, which lay eggs, and are the\r\nlowest of all living Mammals. In the adjacent bay are the Marsupials,\r\nsuch as Kangaroos, Phalangers, or so-called Opossums, Wombats, and\r\nBandicoots of Australasia, and the true Opossums of America. The eighth\r\nand ninth bays on the left side contain the so-called Edentate Mammals,\r\nsuch as the South American Sloths, Ant-eaters, and Armadillos, the\r\nScaly Ant-eaters or Pangolins (fig. 34) of tropical Asia and Africa,\r\nand the African Aard-Vark or Ant-Bear. The Sea-Cows, as represented by\r\nthe Dugong, the Manatee, and the recently extinct Rhytina of Bering\r\nIsland, are shown in the Geological Department. In the second bay are\r\nthe Pigs and Hippopotamuses; in the third the Camels, and near by the\r\nChevrotains, or Mouse-Deer. Following these are the Deer (_Cervidæ_),\r\nmany of which, as already stated, are placed in the middle line of the\r\ngallery. Properly speaking, the Giraffes and their recent and extinct\r\nallies, the former represented by the Okapi of Central Africa (fig.\r\n14, p. 41), should come here; but, as already mentioned, it has been\r\nfound convenient to remove the Giraffe group into the east corridor of\r\nthe central hall. In one of the cases in the bays stands the Prongbuck\r\nor Pronghorn Antelope (fig. 35), the sole living representative of a\r\nfamily characterised by the circumstance that the horns have hollow\r\nbranched sheaths which are shed annually. Next in order come the\r\nAntelopes, a large number of which are placed in the corridors outside\r\nthe gallery. This series, it may be remarked, is particularly fine,\r\nand, in fact, unique. At the last two bays on the right side of the\r\ngallery the visitor reaches the Goats; and in the “pavilion,” at the\r\nwest end of the gallery, he comes to the Sheep, Musk-Oxen, and Oxen, of\r\nwhich there is a magnificent display, both as regards mounted specimens\r\nand horns. Many of the cases in the middle of the gallery and the bays\r\nhave been fitted with artificial groundwork, one of the most striking\r\nbeing the European Reindeer case, for which the materials were brought\r\nfrom Norway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--PRONGBUCK OR PRONGHORN ANTELOPE (_Antilocapra\r\namericana_).]\r\n\r\nContinuing our survey down the left side of the gallery, the bay next\r\nthe pavilion and an adjacent case in the middle line contain the\r\nZebras, Wild Asses and the Wild Horse, among which is a specimen of\r\nthe extinct Quagga. Following this are the Rhinoceroses and Tapirs,\r\nsome of the former being exhibited in the middle of the gallery. Adult\r\nspecimens of all the living species except the one-horned _Rhinoceros\r\nsondaicus_ of Java are exhibited. The cut (fig. 36) shows the form of\r\nthe head and the number of the horns in three members of the group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--HEADS OF THE WHITE RHINOCEROS (_Rhinoceros\r\nsimus, a_), BLACK RHINOCEROS (_R. bicornis, b_), AND GREAT INDIAN\r\nRHINOCEROS (_R. unicornis, c_).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hyraxes.]\r\n\r\nIn a small case by themselves are exhibited the Hyraxes, which\r\nrepresent a subordinal group of Ungulates. In this place should come\r\nthe Elephants (Proboscidea), but it has been found advisable to\r\nexhibit the existing species of this group alongside their extinct\r\nrelatives in the Geological Department, and in the central hall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--MALE AND FEMALE OF THE NORTHERN FUR-SEAL, OR\r\nSEA-BEAR (_Otaria ursina_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--MALE ELEPHANT-SEAL, OR SEA-ELEPHANT (_Mirounga\r\nleonina_).]\r\n\r\nNext in order follow the Seals, Walruses, and Sea-Bears (fig. 37); and\r\nafter these again, the land Carnivora. Among the former, particular\r\nattention may be directed to the specimens of Sea-Elephants or\r\nElephant-Seals (fig. 38) of the Southern Seas and the Pacific coast of\r\nCalifornia. The visitor should also notice the various smaller southern\r\nSeals, obtained during the “Discovery” Expedition, in the case in the\r\nbay. Among the land Carnivora, special interest attaches to the huge\r\nBrown Bear from Alaska, the black and white Bear-like Great Panda (fig.\r\n39) of North-eastern China, and the case of Tigers, in which both the\r\nlong-haired Manchurian and the short-coated Indian race are shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--GREAT PANDA (_Æluropus melanoleucus_).]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND FLOOR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Upper Mammal Gallery.]\r\n\r\nThe portion open to the public of the gallery on this floor in the\r\nwestern wing of the building contains such of the Mammalian orders\r\n(apart from Proboscidea, Cetacea, and Sirenia) as are not shown in the\r\nlower gallery. In the first two wall-cases on the right on entering\r\nthe gallery is displayed a series of Bats, some stuffed, and others\r\nin spirit. In the third wall-case are the Insect-eating Mammals\r\n(Insectivora), such as Shrew-mice, Moles, Hedgehogs, etc. Next come the\r\nRodents, and then the Lemurs, Monkeys, and Apes, the greater number\r\nof the last being exhibited in the large case in the middle of the\r\ngallery. Among the more striking specimens may be mentioned the series\r\nof Gorillas (fig. 40) and Chimpanzees, and the Proboscis and Snub-nosed\r\nMonkeys.\r\n\r\nNearly all the left side of this gallery is devoted to Anthropology,\r\nthat is to say, to the representation of the zoological characters\r\nof the different races of Mankind[18]; the series including busts,\r\nskeletons, skulls, hair, and portraits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--THE GORILLA (_Anthropopithecus gorilla_).]\r\n\r\nAt the west end of the portion of this gallery open to the public\r\nstands a case exhibiting many of the structural differences\r\ndistinguishing the man-like Apes from Man himself; and also showing\r\ndifferent types of human skulls and the method of measuring the same.\r\nOn the adjacent screens and partitions are diagrams, photographs, and\r\nsketches illustrating hand and finger prints, and identification by\r\nmeans of the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST WING.\r\n\r\nGROUND FLOOR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fossil Collection.]\r\n\r\nThe ground floor of this wing consists, as on the other side of the\r\nbuilding, of a gallery running west and east the whole length of the\r\nwing in front, of a smaller parallel gallery behind this, and leading\r\nfrom the latter a series of galleries running north and south. With\r\nthe exception of a certain number of recent skeletons introduced for\r\ncomparison, and some of the specimens of Elephants and Sirenians or\r\nSea-Cows, the whole of this floor is occupied by the collection of the\r\nremains of animals and plants which flourished in geological periods\r\nprevious to the one in which we are now living. Some of these belong\r\nto species still existing upon the earth, but the great majority are\r\nextinct. They are arranged mainly upon zoological principles, that is,\r\nthe groups which are believed to have natural affinities are placed\r\ntogether; but within some of the great divisions thus mapped out,\r\nespecially of the Invertebrata and Plants, it has been found convenient\r\nto adopt a stratigraphical or even geographical grouping, the fossils\r\nof different geological formations being kept apart, and those of the\r\nBritish Isles separated from those of foreign localities.\r\n\r\nThis portion of the Museum is more fully described in the special\r\nGuides[19] than is possible in the present work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elephants, Sea-Cows, and Extinct Mammals.]\r\n\r\nThe front gallery, entered from the central hall, is devoted to\r\nElephants and Sea-Cows, both living and extinct, and to extinct and\r\nfossil Mammals of other groups. Down the middle are placed a number of\r\nlarge and striking objects, of too great size to be contained in the\r\nwall-cases. The first is a nearly complete skeleton of the American\r\nMastodon (fig. 41), an animal closely allied to modern Elephants,\r\nfrom which it is chiefly distinguished by the characters of its\r\ncheek-teeth. This is followed by a skeleton of the existing Indian\r\nElephant (_Elephas maximus_), and the mounted skin of a tuskless male\r\nof the same species, brought home from India by His Majesty King\r\nEdward VII., when Prince of Wales. Further down the gallery is the\r\nskull of the extinct _E. ganesa_--remarkable for the immense length\r\nof its tusks--from the Siwalik Hills of India; and another of the\r\nMammoth (_E. primigenius_), with huge curved tusks, in a perfect state\r\nof preservation, found in the Brick-earth at Ilford, Essex.[20] Then\r\nfollow skeletons of the great extinct Irish Deer (_Cervus giganteus_),\r\nmale and female, the former distinguished by its magnificent spreading\r\nantlers, resembling those of a Fallow Deer on a large scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--SKELETON OF THE AMERICAN MASTODON (_Mastodon\r\namericanus_). Greatly reduced.]\r\n\r\nThe next central case is occupied by the skulls and portions of jaws of\r\na remarkable horned hoofed quadruped, _Arsinoïtherium_ (fig. 42), from\r\nthe Upper Eocene of the Fayum, Egypt. It belongs to an ancient group\r\nnot closely related to any living animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--SKULL of _Arsinoïtherium zitteli_, from the\r\nUpper Eocene Strata of the Fayum, Egypt. About 1/12th natural size.]\r\n\r\nEqually peculiar is the _Toxodon_ (fig. 43) from the Pampas of S.\r\nAmerica, of which a model of an entire skeleton is exhibited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--SKELETON OF THE TOXODON (_Toxodon platensis_).\r\n\r\nFrom the Pampas Formation of Argentina. About 1/18th natural size.]\r\n\r\nNear by is placed a model of a skeleton of the _Dinoceras_ (fig. 44),\r\none of the most remarkable of the many wonderful forms of animal life\r\ndiscovered in the Tertiary beds of the western portion of the United\r\nStates of America. This animal combines in some respects the characters\r\nof a Rhinoceros with those of an Elephant, and has others altogether\r\nspecial to itself. The group to which it belonged became extinct in the\r\nOligocene, or Middle Tertiary, period, without leaving any successors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--SKELETON OF DINOCERAS. From the Eocene of\r\nWyoming, U.S.A. One-thirtieth natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sea-Cows.]\r\n\r\nNear the pavilion is a skeleton (fig. 45) of an interesting animal, the\r\nNorthern Sea-Cow (_Rhytina gigas_ or _stelleri_), the last resort of\r\nwhich was Bering Island in the North Pacific, where it was completely\r\nexterminated towards the close of the eighteenth century. In the\r\nsame case is placed the skeleton of a smaller allied animal, the\r\n_Halitherium_, from the Oligocene of South Germany. These, with their\r\nexisting representatives, the Manatee and Dugong, constitute the order\r\nSirenia, aquatic Mammals of fish-like form, presenting considerable\r\nexternal resemblance to Cetacea (Whales and Dolphins), but differing in\r\nmany points of structure and habit. All the exhibited specimens of the\r\ngroup, both living and extinct, are shown in this gallery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fossil remains of Man.]\r\n\r\nThe wall-cases on the south side (right on entering) contain typical\r\nseries of chipped and polished flint implements of human workmanship,\r\nand also remains of Man found, under circumstances which may justify\r\nthe appellation of “fossil,” in caves or Pleistocene deposits,\r\nassociated with the bones of Mammals either completely or locally\r\nextinct. Then follow in systematic order the bones and teeth of the\r\nother Primates, the Carnivora, Ungulata, and Sirenia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--SKELETON OF THE NORTHERN SEA-COW (_Rhytina\r\ngigas_ or _stelleri_). From Bering Island. Length of specimen, 19 feet\r\n6 inches.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elephants and Ruminants.]\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the north side of the gallery is devoted to the\r\nexhibition of the remains of Proboscidea (Dinotheres, Mastodons, and\r\nElephants), as well as teeth and skulls of the two existing species\r\nof Elephants. The forerunners of the Proboscidea from the Eocene\r\nstrata of Egypt, as represented by _Palæomastodon_ and _Mœritherium_,\r\nare of special interest. Attention may likewise be directed to the\r\nskull of the gigantic Ruminant _Sivatherium_ (fig. 46), from the\r\nSiwalik deposits of Northern India, an ally of the living African\r\nOkapi (p. 41), with which it is connected by _Helladotherium_ of the\r\nGrecian Tertiary deposits; another still more nearly allied type being\r\n_Samotherium_, from the Isle of Samos, of which a skull (fig. 47) is\r\nexhibited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--SKULL OF _Sivatherium giganteum_, an Extinct\r\nRuminant from the Pliocene Deposits of the Siwalik Hills, India. About\r\n1/13th natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edentates.]\r\n\r\nIn the “pavilion,” or large room at the end of the gallery, are\r\nskeletons and bones of the members of the order Edentata, mostly from\r\nSouth America, including fine specimens of the great Ground-Sloths, the\r\nlargest of which, the _Megatherium_, is shown in the act of rearing\r\nitself on its hind-legs and powerful tail to seize and tear down the\r\nbranches of a tree in order to feed upon the leaves. That this was the\r\nhabit of this huge animal is clearly indicated by the structure of\r\nits bones and teeth. The mounted specimen is not an actual skeleton,\r\nbut is composed of plaster-casts of the real bones, most of which are\r\nshown in the wall-case at the north side of the room. Of the _Mylodon_,\r\na smaller but nearly allied animal, an almost perfect skeleton is\r\nexhibited in a glass case near the _Megatherium_. Near by is a portion\r\nof the skin of a closely similar animal (_Grypotherium listai_), from\r\na cave in Patagonia, showing the hair, and also the nodules of bone\r\nembedded in the hide.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marsupials.]\r\n\r\nNot far off is shown one of the glyptodons, huge extinct\r\nArmadillo-like animals, of which the body is enclosed in a solid\r\nbarrel-like bony case. As these animals far surpassed in size their\r\ndiminutive existing representatives, so the gigantic Marsupials of the\r\ncorresponding period in Australia (Pleistocene, or latest Tertiary),\r\nsuch as _Diprotodon_ and _Nototherium_, greatly exceeded any of the\r\nspecies now existing on that continent; of _Diprotodon_ a complete\r\nskeleton is exhibited. On the other hand, all the Mammals of the\r\nearlier geological periods of which remains are known are of diminutive\r\nsize, as seen in the series of jaws, teeth, etc., mostly from the\r\nPurbeck (Upper Oolite) beds of Dorset and the Stonesfield Slate (Great\r\nOolite) of Oxfordshire, exhibited in the centre window-case on the east\r\nside of the room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--SKULL OF _Samotherium boissieri_, an Extinct\r\nOkapi-like Ruminant from the Pliocene Strata of Samos. About ⅙th\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extinct Birds.]\r\n\r\nThe south side of this room (right on entering) is chiefly reserved\r\nfor the remains of extinct Birds, including the famous Lizard-tailed\r\nBird (_Archæopteryx_) of the Solenhofen beds of Bavaria (fig. 48),\r\nthe oldest known member of the class. Although presenting many\r\nReptile-like characters, it had well-developed feathers on the wings\r\nand tail, the impressions of which are beautifully preserved in the\r\nspecimen. A series of skeletons of the “Moas,” or _Dinornithidæ_, of\r\nNew Zealand, birds in which no trace of a wing has been discovered,\r\nshows the diversity in size of different members of the group, some\r\nfar exceeding any existing Ostrich, while others are scarcely larger\r\nthan a good-sized Turkey. Some of these remains are so recent as still\r\nto be covered with dried skin, and even feathers. Several eggs are\r\nalso shown; but, large as these are, they are greatly exceeded in\r\nsize by those of the Roc (_Æpyornis_) from Madagascar. The skull and\r\ncertain other remains of a gigantic extinct bird, _Phororhachos_, from\r\nPatagonia are also shown in this room. These birds appear to have been\r\nallied to the existing South American Seriema.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 48.--SKELETON AND IMPRESSIONS OF THE FEATURES OF THE\r\n      LIZARD-TAILED BIRD (_Archæopteryx macrura_), FROM THE UPPER\r\n      JURASSIC (LITHOGRAPHIC STONE) OF SOLENHOFEN, BAVARIA. About ¼th\r\n      natural size.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--SKELETON OF THE IGUANODON (_Iguanodon\r\nbernissartensis_), a Biped Dinosaur from the Wealden of Belgium. About\r\n1/80th natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extinct Reptiles.]\r\n\r\nThe long corridor north of the fossil Mammal-gallery contains a fine\r\nassemblage of Reptilian remains. The south side is devoted to the Great\r\nSea-Lizards (Sauropterygia and Ichthyopterygia), mostly from the Lias\r\nformation. The skeleton of an Ichthyosaur from the Lias is shown in\r\nfig. 50. Skeletons of Plesiosaurians and Pliosaurians from the Oxford\r\nClay are mounted in central cases. Ranged in the cases on the north\r\nside are remains of the gigantic Dinosaurs, which vastly exceeded in\r\nsize any other land-animals. A mounted plaster cast of a complete\r\nskeleton of the Iguanodon (fig. 49), found (with many others) in the\r\nWealden strata at Bernissart in Belgium, is exhibited in the gallery\r\nof recent Reptiles; but a large series of bones of the same reptile is\r\nshown here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--SKELETON OF AN ICHTHYOSAUR (_Ichthyosaurus\r\ntenuirostris_). From the Lias of Somersetshire. About 1/10th natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nIn the centre of this gallery is placed a large portion of the skeleton\r\nof a gigantic Dinosaur (_Cetiosaurus leedsi_) from the Upper Jurassic\r\nOxford Clay near Peterborough. It is nearly allied to the North\r\nAmerican _Diplodocus_, of which, as mentioned on page 57, the model of\r\na complete skeleton is exhibited in the recent Reptile Gallery. Both\r\n_Cetiosaurus_ and _Diplodocus_ resemble _Brontosaurus_ (fig. 51) in\r\nthe extremely small size of the skull. Another central case contains\r\nan actual skull and other remains of the American Cretaceous horned\r\nDinosaur _Triceratops_ (see page 57), and in wall-case 8 is placed a\r\nplaster cast of the skull of the contemporary _Tyrannosaurus_, the\r\nlargest known carnivorous Dinosaur.\r\n\r\nAt the eastern end of the gallery are the Pterosauria or Ornithosauria,\r\ncommonly called Pterodactyles or Flying Reptiles. Their most gigantic\r\nrepresentatives were the species of _Pteranodon_ from the Upper\r\nCretaceous of Kansas (fig. 53). At the west end is the nearly complete\r\nskeleton of _Pariasaurus_ (fig. 52) from the Karoo formation (Trias)\r\nof South Africa. It occurs also in Russia, and belongs to a primitive\r\nsection of the Theromorphs, or Anomodonts, which include the ancestors\r\nof Mammals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--SKELETON OF _Brontosaurus ingens_, A\r\nFOUR-FOOTED DINOSAUR FROM THE JURASSIC FORMATION OF N. AMERICA. 1/150\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--SKELETON OF PARIASAURUS. About 1/14th natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extinct Fishes.]\r\n\r\nOf the galleries running northwards from the Fossil Reptile gallery,\r\nthe one nearest to the central hall is used for the display of the\r\nFossil Fishes, many belonging to groups now extinct. Perhaps the most\r\nremarkable of all, and certainly most unlike existing forms, are the\r\narmoured Devonian Fishes known as _Cephalaspis_, _Pterichthys_ (fig.\r\n54), etc. The well-preserved fishes from the Chalk are especially\r\nnoteworthy, and a specimen of _Portheus_ in a central case, 14 feet in\r\nlength, is one of the largest bony fishes known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 53.--A GIANT PTERODACTYLE (_Pteranodon occidentalis_) FROM THE\r\n      CRETACEOUS OF KANSAS. (Original span about 18 feet.) Compare the\r\n      wing, which is supported by the outermost finger, with that of\r\n      the Bat in Fig. 8.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extinct Invertebrates and Plants.]\r\n\r\nThe next gallery contains the Cephalopods, a group of Molluscs\r\nabounding in extinct species, of which the Belemnites, Turrilites (fig.\r\n55), and Ammonites (fig. 56) are some of the best-known. The form and\r\nstructure of their nearest living representatives, the various species\r\nof Cuttle-fishes, Squids, Argonauts, and Nautilus (fig. 31, page 62)\r\nare illustrated by models, drawings, and specimens placed near the\r\nentrance of the gallery and along the top-line of the wall-cases. The\r\nthird gallery contains the remaining Mollusca, with the Brachiopoda,\r\nPolyzoa, Echinoderma, Worms, and Crustacea; the fourth, the Corals,\r\nSponges, Protozoa, and Fossil Plants. In these last two galleries most\r\nof the British specimens are placed in the table-cases, and those of\r\nforeign origin in the cases round the walls.\r\n\r\nAmong numerous other groups which cannot be mentioned, great interest\r\nattaches to the Trilobites (fig. 57) of the Palæozoic epoch, which\r\nare related to the modern King-Crabs and also have affinity with the\r\nScorpions.\r\n\r\nVery extensive is the collection of Fossil Plants from the\r\nCoal-Measures, among which _Lepidodendron_ and _Sigillaria_, as well as\r\nnumerous kinds of fern-like leaves, are among the most common.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--UPPER (_A_) AND LOWER (_B_) SURFACES OF\r\nPTERICHTHYS, AN ARMOURED DEVONIAN FISH.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historical Collections.]\r\n\r\nThe table-cases of the end gallery contain certain special collections\r\nof historical interest, either from the circumstances under which\r\nthey were formed, or the manner in which they came into possession\r\nof the Museum, or from their containing a large number of type\r\nspecimens described and figured in various publications. Hence it has\r\nbeen considered undesirable to break up and disperse these among the\r\ngeneral collection. They include the original collection formed by\r\nWilliam Smith, the pioneer of geology in this country, the Searles Wood\r\ncollection of Crag Mollusca, the Edwards collection of Eocene Mollusca,\r\nthe Davidson collection of Brachiopoda, the types of Sowerby’s “Mineral\r\nConchology,” and lastly, but not least in interest, specimens from the\r\ncollection of Sir Hans Sloane, which formed part of the nucleus of the\r\nBritish Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--A TURRILITE, FROM THE CHALK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--AN AMMONITE, FROM THE OÖLITE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--A TRILOBITE, FROM THE LOWER CAMBRIAN OF\r\nSHROPSHIRE.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British Stratigraphical Collection.]\r\n\r\nIn the wall-cases on the west side of this gallery is exhibited a\r\nstratigraphical collection, showing a series of rock-specimens, often\r\nwith their included fossil remains, representing the various geological\r\nformations of the British Isles; they are arranged in the order of\r\ntheir sequence in time, commencing near the entrance door with the most\r\nrecent, and gradually passing down to the most ancient fossil-bearing\r\nstrata. Along the top of the case is displayed a running section of all\r\nthe water-formed rocks of England in the order of their succession,\r\neach bed being distinctively coloured, and named to correspond with\r\nthe actual specimens placed beneath. The stratigraphical collection is\r\nfollowed by some illustrations of rock-formation, and certain curious\r\nrock-structures simulating fossils. On the east side are exhibited\r\nadditional specimens of marine Reptiles from the Lias and a series\r\nof footprints of Reptiles from the Trias of N. America, the New Red\r\nSandstone of England, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST FLOOR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gallery of Minerals.]\r\n\r\nThe gallery on this floor, entered from the south end of the east\r\ncorridor of the hall, contains the extensive Mineral collections, a\r\nfuller description of which will be found in special guides.[21]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Introductory Collections.]\r\n\r\nEntering the gallery the visitor will find, in the first window-case\r\non the left-hand side, a series of specimens selected and labelled\r\nto serve as an introduction to the study of Minerals. Beginning with\r\na definition of what is meant by a Mineral, it shows how essential\r\ncharacters were gradually recognised, and how Minerals are distributed\r\ninto kinds and classified. In the next three window-cases specimens are\r\narranged to illustrate the characters of Minerals and the various terms\r\nused in their description.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rocks.]\r\n\r\nIn the remaining six window-cases on the same side of the gallery, a\r\ncorresponding series of specimens illustrative of the characters and\r\nclassification of Rocks is exhibited; and the eleven window-cases on\r\nthe opposite side contain a collection illustrating the various kinds\r\nof Rocks.[22]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Collection of Minerals.]\r\n\r\nIn the table-cases of the gallery are exhibited specimens of every\r\nimportant Mineral species and variety preserved in the Museum. The\r\ncases containing this general collection are numbered from 1 to 41, and\r\nthe eight panes of each case are severally distinguished by the letters\r\n_a_ to _h_. For the use of the student there is published an Index to\r\nthe names of all the numerous Mineral species and varieties represented\r\nin the collection, with references to the table-cases in which the\r\nspecimens are placed.[23]\r\n\r\nThe system of classification, which includes not only ores, but all\r\nknown Minerals, is not easy for the visitor to follow, and it is\r\ntherefore convenient to indicate the positions in the gallery of\r\nthose minerals--as, for instance, precious and ornamental stones, and\r\nmetallic ores--which have an interest for all; for details, reference\r\nmust be made to the Mineral Guide. Most of these Minerals occur\r\nas crystals, the forms of which can be referred to six systems of\r\ncrystallisation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--THE COLENSO DIAMOND, FROM SOUTH AFRICA.\r\nNATURAL SIZE.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Native Elements.]\r\n\r\nI. In cases 1 and 2 are the native metals, as Copper, Silver, Gold,\r\nand Platinum; and non-metals, as Sulphur, Diamond, and Graphite. The\r\nlarge symmetrical South African “Colenso” Diamond (fig. 58), weighing\r\n130 carats, presented by the late Professor John Ruskin, is worthy of\r\nspecial attention (case 1f). Models of some famous diamonds, including\r\n“The Cullinan Diamond,” the largest ever found (weight before being\r\ncut, 3025¾ carats, or about 1⅓ lb. av.) are exhibited.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sulphides.]\r\n\r\nII. The next six cases contain Minerals which have mostly a metallic\r\nlustre and consist of metals in chemical combination with elements of\r\nthe Sulphur or Arsenic groups.\r\n\r\nArgentite (3d) is an important Silver-ore, containing 87 per cent. of\r\nSilver and 13 of Sulphur.\r\n\r\nBlende (4b) is a valuable Zinc-ore, and contains 67 per cent. of Zinc\r\nand 33 per cent. of Sulphur.\r\n\r\nGalena (4e) is by far the most important ore of Lead (Lead 87, Sulphur\r\n13, per cent.).\r\n\r\nCopper-glance (3e) is a common ore of Copper (Copper 80, Sulphur 20,\r\nper cent.).\r\n\r\nCinnabar (3h) is the ore from which Mercury or Quicksilver is obtained\r\n(Mercury 86, Sulphur 14, per cent.).\r\n\r\nPyrites (5d), one of the most common of Minerals, is a compound of Iron\r\nand Sulphur (Iron 47, Sulphur 53, per cent.).\r\n\r\nErubescite (5e), Copper pyrites (5f), and Tetrahedrite, or Grey\r\nCopper-ore (7a), are valuable sources of Copper. [Sidenote: Chlorides,\r\netc.]\r\n\r\nIII. Common Salt, the chloride of the metal Sodium, is exhibited in\r\ncase 8f, and Fluor-spar, a fluoride of Calcium belonging to the same\r\ndivision, begins at case 7e.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oxides.]\r\n\r\nIV. The next division consists of compounds of Oxygen and includes most\r\nof the stony Minerals.\r\n\r\nCuprite (10a), an important ore of Copper (Copper 89, Oxygen 11, per\r\ncent.), is at first ruby-red in colour, but becomes blackened by\r\nexposure to light.\r\n\r\nSpinel (10e), in its transparent varieties, is one of the precious\r\nstones; the deep red being the Spinel Ruby (less dense and less hard\r\nthan the true Ruby), the rose-tinted the Balas Ruby, and the yellow or\r\norange-red the Rubicelle of the jewellers: sometimes, it has a dark\r\nblue colour. On account of their hardness, the less valuable specimens\r\nare used for the jewelling of watches.\r\n\r\nMagnetite, or Magnetic Iron-ore (10f), the richest ore of Iron, of\r\nwhich it contains 72 per cent., is the natural magnet.\r\n\r\nUraninite, or Pitchblende (10h), consists mainly of Uranium and Oxygen,\r\nbut contains traces of Helium and Radium, of which latter it is the\r\ncommercial source.\r\n\r\nChrysoberyl (9e) is another precious stone, almost equal in lustre and\r\nhardness to the Sapphire; one variety is a beautiful greenish-yellow;\r\nanother, with a peculiar play of light, is the Cat’s-eye; and a third,\r\ngreen by sunlight, but red by candle- or lamp-light, is known as\r\nAlexandrite.\r\n\r\nCorundum (9f), when clear and of the proper colour, is, after the\r\nDiamond, the most precious of stones. When pure, it is colourless, but\r\nwith minute traces of colouring ingredient it assumes the richest and\r\nmost varied hues; when red it is Ruby, and when blue Sapphire; the\r\nyellow, green, and purple varieties were at one time known respectively\r\nas the Oriental Topaz, Emerald, and Amethyst. The prefix “Oriental”\r\nwas at first used to suggest that the stones are not ordinary Topaz,\r\nEmerald, and Amethyst, but other similarly coloured minerals coming\r\nfrom the East (India, Ceylon, Siam, Pegu, etc.); it was afterwards\r\nunderstood to suggest only the excellence of their characters. The\r\nStar-stone, another variety of Corundum, when placed in a strong light\r\nshows a six-rayed star.\r\n\r\nHæmatite (11a) is a valuable ore of iron (Iron 70, Oxygen 30, per\r\ncent.).\r\n\r\nCassiterite, or Tin-stone (11f), is the ore of Tin, of which metal it\r\ncontains 79 per cent.\r\n\r\nZircon (13b), when clear and without flaws, is one of the precious\r\nstones: one variety with peculiar red tints is the Hyacinth or Jacynth,\r\nwhile the colourless, yellowish, and dull green phases are termed\r\nJargoon: the colourless variety, owing to its high refractive and\r\ndispersive power, approaches the Diamond in brilliancy.\r\n\r\nQuartz, which is Silica, the oxide of Silicon, is the most common of\r\nMinerals. In its clear and transparent variety it is the Crystal of\r\nthe ancients and the Rock-Crystal of modern times; it is the Brazilian\r\nPebble of spectacle-makers (14c). After the clear come the smoky\r\nvarieties, including the Scotch Cairngorm and Occidental Topaz (14g).\r\nNext follows the Amethyst (14g), one of the less valuable, though one\r\nof the most beautiful, of gem stones. The Quartz Cat’s-eye (13f) is a\r\nvariety presenting a similar play of light to that of the Chrysoberyl\r\nCat’s-eye already referred to: the effect is due to enclosed fibres\r\nof an Asbestos-like mineral in the specimens from Ceylon, and to\r\nfibres of Crocidolite in the blue, and of altered Crocidolite in the\r\nbrownish-yellow specimens from South Africa.\r\n\r\nJasper (13g) is a coloured mixture of Silica and Clay, distinguished\r\nfrom ordinary Quartz by its opacity and dull earthy fracture. It is of\r\nvarious colours, chiefly red, brown, yellow, and green; the colours\r\nbeing arranged sometimes in a nodular form, as in Egyptian Jasper, at\r\nother times in stripes, as in Riband Jasper.\r\n\r\nThe Lydian or Touch-stone (15a), by reason of its hardness and black\r\ncolour, has been used from remote ages to test the purity of precious\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\nHornstone (15a) is a variety of Silica without evident\r\ncrystallisation, and generally presenting a more or less splintery\r\nfracture; in one kind, Flint (15b), the surface of fracture is\r\ngenerally shell-shaped (conchoidal), sometimes conical, as is well\r\nshown by specimens in the case.\r\n\r\nChalcedony (15b), which has a lustre nearly that of wax, is\r\ntranslucent. The specimens of Enhydros from Uruguay (15d) are of\r\nespecial interest as containing imprisoned water.\r\n\r\nHeliotrope, or Bloodstone (16a), is a green stone with red, blood-like\r\nspots.\r\n\r\nNext follow the Plasma and Chrysoprase, which are green stones: and the\r\nSard, generally brownish-red; as also the Sardonyx, its banded variety.\r\nAll were much prized by the ancients because, though hard and tough\r\nenough to resist ordinary wear and tear, they are more suited to the\r\ndisplay of the engraver’s skill than the still harder and more precious\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nThen come the Agates (16b), chiefly formed of thin layers of porous\r\nChalcedony of different colours, though the material of many of the\r\nwhite layers is a compact Semi-opal. Most are now brought from Uruguay,\r\nin South America, and cut and polished at Oberstein, in Germany, where\r\nin former times Agates were collected in quantity from the mountains of\r\nthe district. Sometimes the layers are parallel, and the stone is then\r\nan Onyx, useful as a material for cameos: or the bands of a section\r\nare arranged in parallel sets of zigzag lines, and the stone is then\r\ncalled a Fortification-agate; but in the ordinary agate the layers are\r\nvariously curved. Moss-agates, or Mocha-stones (16e), are varieties of\r\nChalcedony enclosing moss-like forms of oxides of Manganese and Iron,\r\nand green earthy Chlorite. Carnelian (16e) is a beautiful red stone\r\nmuch valued by the engraver: its fracture has a peculiar waxy lustre,\r\nand is distinct from that of the Sard, which is dull and horn-like.\r\n\r\nOpal, including the Precious or Noble Opal (16f), among the specimens\r\nof which is a fine suite from Queensland presented by the late\r\nProfessor Story-Maskelyne, is hydrated Silica.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Carbonates.]\r\n\r\nWitherite, the carbonate of Barium (18a), is used in the manufacture\r\nof plate-glass. Strontianite (18b), the carbonate of Strontium, is one\r\nof two minerals from which Strontium nitrate is made for use in the\r\nmanufacture of fireworks, owing to the fine crimson colour which the\r\nsalt gives to the flame: the Strontium minerals are also employed in\r\nconnection with sugar-refining. Cerussite (18b) is the corresponding\r\ncarbonate of Lead, and when abundant is a valuable ore of that metal.\r\n\r\nCalcite (18e), a carbonate of the metal Calcium, is represented by\r\na fine suite of specimens, illustrating an almost endless variety\r\nof crystalline form. The clear variety from Iceland is largely used\r\nin optical instruments for polarising light. Chalybite, or Spathic\r\nIron-ore (20h), is the carbonate of Iron, and a valuable ore of that\r\nmetal. The most important English Iron-ore, Clay Ironstone, is a\r\nmixture of Chalybite and Clay. Calamine (19h), a carbonate of Zinc,\r\nis an important Zinc-ore. Chessylite (21d) and Malachite (22b) are\r\nrespectively the blue and green carbonates of Copper, and are used as\r\nores of that metal. Malachite is found in large masses; by reason of\r\nthe high polish which it takes and its beautiful markings, it is much\r\nused for ornamental work of various kinds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Silicates.]\r\n\r\nPassing to the Silicates, we come to Olivine (22f), one of the less\r\nhard of the precious stones; when of a yellow colour it is known as\r\nChrysolite, while the green variety is the Peridot of jewellers.\r\nHiddenite (23a) is a rare emerald-green variety of Spodumene, and\r\nKunzite is a lilac-coloured variety which is used as a gem stone.\r\n\r\nAsbestos (24c), a kind of Hornblende (a mineral common in rocks of\r\nigneous origin), is found in long fibres; in some of its varieties it\r\nis so flexible that it can be woven into gloves and other articles. The\r\nterm Asbestos, meaning unquenched or unquenchable, was applied by the\r\nancient Greeks, because, owing to being unaltered by heat, wicks made\r\nof this mineral were used in maintaining the perpetual sacred fires of\r\ntheir temples. Napkins of Asbestos were cleaned by being thrown into\r\nthe fire; Asbestos-cloth was also used in the process of cremation to\r\nkeep the ashes of the body distinct from those of the fuel. It is now\r\nemployed for lining iron-safes, packing for steam-pipes and boilers,\r\nand in gas-stoves, for which purposes its low conductivity for heat\r\nrenders it serviceable.\r\n\r\nJade or Nephrite (24d), a valued mineral, belongs to the same group as\r\nHornblende. The various shades of colour and the beautiful polish which\r\nthis tough mineral will take are illustrated by specimens in the case.\r\nSeveral worked specimens from New Zealand and China are exhibited. An\r\nimmense water-worn mass, weighing 1156 lb., found some years ago in\r\nAsiatic Russia, is mounted on a separate stand near by.\r\n\r\nMeerschaum (23g), the light soft porous mineral used for tobacco-pipes,\r\nis a hydrated silicate of Magnesium. Serpentine (25a) is another\r\nhydrated Magnesium-silicate: the ease with which it is worked and\r\npolished, its green colour, and varied markings render it much sought\r\nafter as a material for mantel-pieces, tables, and other indoor work:\r\nexposed to the weather it soon loses its polish.\r\n\r\nTopaz (25c) in its clear varieties is one of the precious stones. The\r\ncrystals from the Urulga river, Siberia, are remarkably fine, and of a\r\ndelicate brown colour; they are kept covered, as the action of light\r\nslowly bleaches them. The yellow crystals from Brazil assume a peculiar\r\npink colour when heated, and are then known to jewellers as Burnt or\r\nPink Topaz. A fine orange-red crystal from Brazil is exhibited.\r\n\r\nGarnet also belongs to the group of precious stones; when the red is\r\ntinged with violet, the stone is the Almandine or Syrian Garnet (named\r\nafter Syriam in Pegu), and when cut _en cabochon_, the Carbuncle of\r\njewellery (26f); the Cinnamon-stone or Hessonite varies in tint from\r\nhyacinth-red to honey-yellow (26e); the Pyrope, including the “Cape\r\nRuby” and the Bohemian garnet, is blood-red (26e), Demantoid is an\r\nemerald-green (26g).\r\n\r\nJadeite (27a) is one of the green stones which, under the name of Jade,\r\nare wrought into ornaments in China: from jade it is distinguished\r\nby its chemical composition, structure, and higher specific gravity.\r\nAmong the specimens of Epidote (27c) a remarkable series from the\r\nUntersulzbachthal, Austria, is exhibited.\r\n\r\nMica (28a) is the name given to a group of minerals differing much from\r\neach other in chemical composition and optical properties, but having\r\nas a common character an easy splitting, or cleavage, in a single\r\ndirection, and thus affording plates remarkably thin, transparent,\r\ntough, and elastic. One of these minerals, Muscovite (28d), has been\r\nused in Russia in place of glass for windows, and is now in common\r\nuse for lanterns and stoves, not being so easily cracked as glass by\r\nchanges of temperature; it is often known in commerce as talc, a term\r\nrestricted by mineralogists to a different mineral.\r\n\r\nThe group of Felspars, the most important of the rock-forming minerals,\r\nbegins at case 28f. After the Felspars comes Beryl, of which the\r\nbright green variety, Emerald (29c), is one of the most valued of\r\nprecious stones. It was in ancient times worked in Egypt, as is proved\r\nby specimens found in the old workings by Sir Gardner Wilkinson, and\r\npresented by him to the Museum. Emeralds occur in the Urals; but the\r\nlocality for the finest stones has long been Muzo, about seventy miles\r\nfrom Santa Fé de Bogotá, in South America. Faceted specimens of the\r\ncolourless Beryl, of the bluish-green Beryl, known in jewellery as\r\nAquamarine, and of pink Beryl from California and Madagascar, are\r\nexhibited (30a).\r\n\r\nIn cases 30f to 32d will be found examples of the Zeolite group of\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\nTourmaline (33a), when free from flaws, is, in some of its varieties,\r\nto be classed with the precious stones; among these being a pink\r\nvariety called Rubellite. Fine specimens of Rubellite from Burma, the\r\nUrals, and Madagascar, are shown in the case; one specimen from Burma,\r\npoor in colour but remarkable for its size and shape, was brought home\r\nby Colonel Symes, to whom it had been presented by the King of Ava in\r\nthe year 1795. The pink-and-green tourmalines from Maine, U.S.A., and\r\nthe magnificent crystals from San Diego Co., California, are among the\r\nmore beautiful of the mineral products of the United States. Examples\r\nof the blue Tourmaline, or Indicolite, are shown in case 33b.\r\n\r\nA rich blue mineral, the Lapis-lazuli of jewellery (34b), brought\r\nfrom Persia, Siberia, Bokhara, and Chili, is a mixture of various\r\nspecies. When powdered, Lapis-lazuli furnished the once costly\r\npigment ultramarine; but by the discovery of a method of producing an\r\nartificial and cheap form of the latter, the use of the mineral as a\r\npigment has ceased.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sulphates, Phosphates, etc.]\r\n\r\nThe sulphates of Strontium, Celestite (35c), of Barium, Barytes or\r\nHeavy Spar (36a), and of Lead, Anglesite (36e), are all represented by\r\nseries of specimens.\r\n\r\nGypsum, or Selenite (36f), is a hydrated sulphate of the metal Calcium:\r\nwhen heated, it gives up its water of crystallisation and falls to a\r\nwhite powder, known as “Plaster of Paris,” which, when moistened, again\r\ncombines with water and yields a coherent solid. Gypseous Alabaster, a\r\nmassive variety of Gypsum (36h), owing to its whiteness, fine texture,\r\nand softness is used as a material for statuettes and other indoor\r\nornaments. Oriental Alabaster is a harder substance, Stalagmitic\r\nCalcite, carbonate of Calcium.\r\n\r\nBorax (37c), a borate of Sodium, is much used as a flux, also in\r\nsoldering, and in the preparation of easily fusible enamels. It was\r\nformerly carried over the Himalayas on sheep and goats from lakes in\r\nTibet, but is now obtained largely from the Borax-lakes of the United\r\nStates, and is also extensively prepared from the boracic acid lagoons\r\nin Tuscany.\r\n\r\nNitratine or Soda-nitre (37d), found in Chili in beds of large extent,\r\nis largely used for the preparation of Nitric Acid and Saltpetre, and\r\nis also used as a fertiliser.\r\n\r\nCalaite or Turquoise (38g), a phosphate of the metals Aluminium and\r\nCopper, is generally massive; only very rarely does it occur in the\r\ncrystalline state. Being as hard as Felspar and taking a good polish,\r\nit has been much prized in jewellery; that which comes into the market\r\nis chiefly brought from the Turquoise-mines not far from Nishapur, in\r\nPersia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amber.]\r\n\r\nAs a supplement to the collection of simple Minerals, is arranged,\r\nin case 41, a group of natural substances which either belong or are\r\nclosely related to the Mineral Kingdom, although, in the formation\r\nof most, organised matter has played a very important part. The most\r\nimportant of these are Coal and Amber. Coal (41a), in most of its\r\nvarieties, gives structural evidence of its vegetable origin: its\r\nchemical composition depends on the amount of change which has taken\r\nplace, and thus is less definite than in the preceding minerals. In\r\nthe variety called Anthracite all traces of the original organised\r\nstructure have disappeared. Amber (41c), in ancient times regarded\r\nas one of the precious stones, is likewise of vegetable origin. It\r\nis fossil resin, chiefly derived from trees allied to the pines; its\r\noriginally sticky condition is proved by the insects sometimes found\r\nenclosed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Larger Mineral Specimens.]\r\n\r\nIn the pavilion at the east end of the gallery the visitor will\r\nfind many mineral specimens which, owing to their size, cannot be\r\nsatisfactorily exhibited in the table-cases.\r\n\r\nAmong these, attention may be directed to the magnificent series of\r\nMinerals in the wall-cases, and to the large specimen of Gypsum, or\r\nSelenite, presented by H.R.H. the late Prince Consort, which, with some\r\nfine masses of Iceland Spar, is exhibited in a special case.\r\n\r\nOf the four table-cases in the windows of the pavilion, the first\r\nthree contain a series illustrating the various kinds of Pseudomorphs,\r\nor minerals in which the original constituent has been altered and\r\nreplaced by a new substance which preserves the crystalline form of\r\nthe first. The fourth displays a set of specimens selected by the late\r\nProfessor Ruskin to illustrate varieties of Silica.[24]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meteorites.]\r\n\r\nThe most important feature of the pavilion is the collection of\r\nMeteorites,[25] of which the smaller specimens are shown in the four\r\ncentral cases. The fall of masses of stone and iron from the sky,\r\nthough observed again and again since the most remote ages, was very\r\nrarely credited by anyone beside the spectators themselves; and till\r\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century no attempt was made to collect\r\nsuch specimens for examination and comparison. In the special guide\r\nit is shown how evidence of the actual fall of such bodies at length\r\nbecame irresistible, and a description is given of the circumstances\r\nattending their fall, of their general characters, and their chemical\r\ncomposition: illustrative specimens, collected together for easy\r\nreference, will be found in one of the cases. It is also shown that\r\nmeteorites are closely related, not only to shooting stars, but also to\r\ncomets, and probably to nebulæ and fixed stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND FLOOR.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Botanical Gallery.]\r\n\r\nThe upper floor of the East wing is devoted to the Department of Botany.\r\n\r\nThe Collections of this Department consist of two portions, the one\r\nopen to the public and consisting of specimens suitable for exhibition,\r\nand mainly intended to illustrate the various groups of the Vegetable\r\nKingdom and the broad facts on which the natural system of the\r\nclassification of plants is based; the other set apart for the use of\r\npersons engaged in the detailed scientific study of plants.\r\n\r\nOn the landing outside the gallery is a series of tree-sections\r\nrepresenting some common British-grown trees, with sections and bark\r\nof the Cork-Oak (_Quercus suber_), and large sections of the White Fir\r\nand Douglas Pine from British Columbia. The Douglas Pine was cut down\r\nin 1885 when 533 years old; its age is indicated by the annual rings\r\nseen in transverse section of the wood, and a record of events has been\r\npainted on the surface. A collection of plant-abnormalities is also\r\nshown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: System of Classification.]\r\n\r\nThe system of classification followed in the exhibition-cases in the\r\npublic gallery is a modification of one widely used on the Continent\r\nand in America. In the first bay on the left-hand side an attempt has\r\nbeen made to illustrate, by means of books dealing with the subject,\r\nthe history and development of modern systems of classification.\r\nThere is a _Guide_[26] to this exhibition. The series of specimens\r\n(starting on the north, or left-hand, side of the gallery) begins\r\nwith the simpler orders of Dicotyledonous Seed-plants, those in which\r\npetals are wanting in the flower or if present are free from each\r\nother, and passes on to the less simple orders with united petals.\r\nThe orders are represented by dried or otherwise prepared specimens\r\nof the plants themselves, drawings, fruits, and prepared sections of\r\nthe woods. Diagrams are employed to indicate the characters in the\r\nflowers on which the grouping is based. The use of the same colour for\r\ncorresponding structures throughout the diagrams readily conveys to the\r\neye the points of agreement or difference on which the classification\r\nrests. The geological history of each natural order is indicated on a\r\ntable of strata, and its present distribution on the surface of the\r\nearth given on a small map of the world. Descriptive labels afford\r\nparticular information respecting each specimen.\r\n\r\nThe Dicotyledonous Plants extend to the fifth case on the left side of\r\nthe gallery, and are followed by the Monocotyledonous orders, which\r\nfill a portion of the last case on the same side, the two half-cases\r\nat the end of the gallery, and the first case returning towards the\r\ndoor. The Gymnosperms are placed in the next case. Then follow the\r\nCryptogams, a case being devoted to the higher, vascular orders, and\r\nanother to the cellular plants. The series closes with an interesting\r\ncollection of models of the larger British Fungi, coloured and mounted\r\nin accordance with their natural habitats. A Catalogue of these models\r\nhas been prepared.[27] In the table-case in the last bay is placed an\r\nillustrated collection of the British Mycetozoa, to which there is\r\nalso a _Guide_.[28] A large chalk-like mass of Diatom-earth containing\r\ntwelve billion Diatoms is placed in a case by itself near the entrance\r\nto the gallery. The table- and window-cases in the bays contain\r\nexhibitions of interest under the following heads: Insectivorous plants\r\n(at present in the Central Hall), Parasitic plants, Water-plants,\r\nXerophytic plants, Epiphytic plants, Adaptations for Defence, Climbing\r\nplants, Fertilisation of flowers (also in the Hall), and Dispersal\r\nof seeds, a selection of British plants dried in sand and preserving\r\ntheir form and colour, and a series of Lichens from Chili. Attention\r\nmay likewise be directed to a series of coloured drawings of British\r\nPlants. At the entrance of the gallery on the right is placed a camera\r\nto exhibit stereoscopic views of plants in their natural colours; and\r\non the left is a model of a large fungus (_Hydnum_).\r\n\r\nAt the end of the gallery the larger specimens of Palms are set up\r\nagainst the screen dividing the gallery from the Herbarium; other\r\nPalms, Cycads, Tree-ferns, etc., are placed in the bays next the\r\nappropriate wall-cases. Suspended from the roof is a fine specimen\r\nof the “Wabo” Bamboo (_Dendrocalamus_) from Burma, 81 feet long; and\r\non the floor of the gallery are specimens of the Vegetable Sheep\r\n(_Raoulia_) of New Zealand, a large aërial root of a Banyan, a\r\nBrazilian Tree-lily (_Vellozia_), a large Bamboo from Demerara, an\r\nAustralian Grass-tree (_Kingia_), a Brazilian Palm (_Acrocomia_), a\r\nSugar-cane, and a Japanese Cycad.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British Plants.]\r\n\r\nA collection of British Plants is exhibited in glazed frames fastened\r\nby hinges to uprights. The classification of the Flowering Plants and\r\nFerns is that used in Bentham’s “Handbook of the British Flora,” and\r\ndescriptions are attached as labels to each plant.[29] Three series of\r\nframes contain specimens of the British Flowering Plants and Ferns. The\r\nfourth frame is occupied with the Mosses and Stoneworts (Characeæ),\r\nand forms the beginning of the exhibition of Cellular Plants. The\r\nseries is continued in the frames on the other side of the gallery\r\ncontaining the lower Fungi and coloured drawings of the larger Fungi;\r\na small series of the larger kind of Fungi found near London is also\r\nshown. In the first bay to the right on entering are series of coloured\r\ndrawings (natural size) of edible and poisonous fungi, and of field and\r\ncultivated mushrooms and poisonous or worthless species often mistaken\r\nfor mushrooms. A _Guide_[30] to the latter series has been prepared.\r\nThe British Lichens are arranged in a cabinet of shallow glass-topped\r\ndrawers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Herbarium.]\r\n\r\nAbove the entrance to the great Herbarium is a life-size photograph of\r\nan Orchid (_Phalænopsis_) from the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nThe portion reserved for the use of the scientific student consists\r\nmainly of the great Herbarium of Flowering Plants. This is a collection\r\nof dried plants, respectively fastened on single sheets of stiff folio\r\npaper, and representing, so far as it has been possible to obtain them,\r\nevery species of living plant and the distribution of each of these on\r\nthe surface of the earth. The various species are collected under their\r\nrespective genera, which are arranged in their natural orders; the\r\nwhole being classified according to the system of Bentham and Hooker’s\r\n“Genera Plantarum.” The plants of the British Isles form a small\r\nseparate collection. The important herbarium of Sir Hans Sloane is kept\r\ndistinct in its original form, the plants being pasted on the pages of\r\n333 large folios. There are other ancient herbaria of great historic\r\nand scientific interest, as well as an excellent working library and a\r\ncollection of drawings of plants. The Herbarium of Vascular Cryptogams\r\n(Ferns) and Cellular Plants (Mosses, Liverworts, Algæ, Lichens, and\r\nFungi) is in a separate room entered from the head of the great\r\nstaircase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTED LIST\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nNATURAL HISTORY PUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\nOF THE TRUSTEES OF THE\r\n\r\nBRITISH MUSEUM.\r\n\r\n\r\n The History of the Collections contained in the Natural History\r\n   Departments of the British Museum.

Subsequently, the Presidents of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries and of the Royal Academy of Arts, a Trustee by special\r\nnomination of the Sovereign, and three more family Trustees were added\r\nto the Board.\r\n\r\n[2] In judging the appearance of the exterior of the building, it\r\nshould be remembered that these fronts are required to complete the\r\ndesign, as the externally unsightly brick galleries which run back\r\nfrom the main front, and are now conspicuous when the Museum is seen\r\nfrom either west or east, are intended to be concealed by them (_see\r\nFrontispiece_).\r\n\r\n[3] Palæontology, or the study of fossil animals and plants, would\r\nhave been a more appropriate designation, as Geology, the science\r\nwhich investigates the history of the earth, and the changes which its\r\nsurface has undergone in attaining its present condition, has a much\r\nwider scope.\r\n\r\n[4] For conditions as to admission and regulation, see p. 119.\r\n\r\n[5] In the _homœodont_ type the teeth are alike, in the _heterodont_\r\nthey are divided into groups.\r\n\r\n[6] See Special Guide, price 6_d._\r\n\r\n[7] See Special Guide, price 1_s._\r\n\r\n[8] See Special Guides, price respectively 2_s._ 6_d._, 6_d._, 4_d._\r\n\r\n[9] See Special Guide, price 1_s._\r\n\r\n[10] See Special Guide, price 1_s._\r\n\r\n[11] See Special Guide, price 1_s._\r\n\r\n[12] See Special Guide, price 1_s._\r\n\r\n[13] See Special Guide, price 6_d._\r\n\r\n[14] See Special Guide, price 6_d._\r\n\r\n[15] See Special Guide, price 6_d._\r\n\r\n[16] “Guide to the Whales, Porpoises, and Dolphins exhibited in the\r\nDepartment of Zoology.” Price 4_d._\r\n\r\n[17] “Guide to the Galleries of Mammals,” (6_d._); “Guide to Great Game\r\nAnimals (Ungulata),” (1_s._); and “Guide to the Horse Family,” (1_s._).\r\n\r\n[18] See “Guide to the Specimens Illustrating the Races of Mankind\r\n(Anthropology).” Price 4_d._\r\n\r\n[19] “Guide to the Fossil Mammals and Birds,” price 6_d._; “Guide to\r\nthe Fossil Reptiles, Amphibians, and Fishes,” price 9_d._; and “Guide\r\nto the Fossil Invertebrate Animals,” price 1_s._\r\n\r\n[20] See “Guide to the Elephants (Recent and Fossil).” Price 6_d._\r\n\r\n[21] “Guide to the Mineral Gallery.” Price 1_d._ “Introduction to the\r\nStudy of Minerals, with a Guide to the Mineral Gallery.” Price 6_d._\r\n\r\n[22] “Introduction to the Study of Rocks and Guide to the Museum\r\nCollection.” Price 1_s._\r\n\r\n[23] “The Student’s Index to the Collection of Minerals.” Price 2_d._\r\n\r\n[24] Catalogue of a series of specimens illustrative of the more common\r\nforms of Native Silica.

Also, to make the identifiers within some illustrations\r\nreadable, the illustrations have not been resized uniformly in this\r\neBook, so their sizes, relative to each other, are not always the same\r\nas the ones in the original book.\r\n\r\nIllustrations and Sidenotes have been positioned between paragraphs\r\nin this eBook. Consequently, the page references in the List of\r\nIllustrations do not always match the placement in this eBook, and some\r\nof the Sidenotes refer to material towards the middle or end of the\r\nparagraphs that follow them.\r\n\r\nPage 55: “feed on young cocoanuts” was printed with the “a”.",
