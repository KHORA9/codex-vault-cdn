These, so far as I became\r\naware of them, I have endeavoured to correct in the present, as well as\r\nin previous impressions.\r\n\r\nBut my principal reliance for the suggestion and supply both of\r\namendments and omissions has been on the press and the public of Ceylon;\r\nwhose familiarity with the topics discussed naturally renders them the\r\nmost competent judges as to the mode in which they have been treated. My\r\nhope when the book was published in October last was, that before going\r\nagain to press I should be in possession of such friendly communications\r\nand criticisms from the island, as would have enabled me to render the\r\nsecond edition much more valuable than the previous one. In this\r\nexpectation I have been agreeably disappointed, the sale having been so\r\nrapid, as to require a fourth impression before it was possible to\r\nobtain from Ceylon judicious criticisms on the first. These in due time\r\nwill doubtless arrive; and meanwhile, I have endeavoured, by careful\r\nrevision, to render the whole as far as possible correct.\r\n\r\nJ. EMERSON TENNENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTICE TO THE THIRD EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe call for a third edition on the same day that the second was\r\nannounced for publication, and within less than two months from the\r\nappearance of the first, has furnished a gratifying assurance of the\r\ninterest which the public are disposed to take in the subject of the\r\npresent work.\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, I have felt it my duty to make several alterations in\r\nthe present impression, amongst the most important of which is the\r\ninsertion of a Chapter on the doctrines of Buddhism as it developes\r\nitself in Ceylon.[1] In the historical sections I had already given an\r\naccount of its introduction by Mahindo, and of the establishments\r\nfounded by successive sovereigns for its preservation and diffusion. To\r\nrender the narrative complete, it was felt desirable to insert an\r\nabstract of the peculiar tenets of the Buddhists; and this want it has\r\nbeen my object to supply. The sketch, it will be borne in mind, is\r\nconfined to the principal features of what has been denominated\r\n\"_Southern Buddhism_\" amongst the Singhalese; as distinguished from\r\n\"_Northern Buddhism_\" in Nepal, Thibet, and China.[2] The latter has\r\nbeen largely illustrated by the labours of Mr. B.H. HODGSON and the\r\ntoilsome researches of M. CSOMA of Körrös in Transylvania; and the\r\nminutest details of the doctrines and ceremonies of the former have been\r\nunfolded in the elaborate and comprehensive collections of Mr. SPENCE\r\nHARDY.[3] From materials discovered by these and other earnest\r\ninquirers, Buddhism in its general aspect has been ably delineated in\r\nthe dissertations of BURNOUF[4] and SAINT HILAIRE[5], and in the\r\ncommentaries of REMUSAT[6], STANISLAS JULIEN[7], FOUCAUX[8], LASSEN[9],\r\nand WEBER.[10] The portion thus added to the present edition has been to\r\na great extent taken from a former work of mine on the local\r\nsuperstitions of Ceylon, and the \"_Introduction and Progress of\r\nChristianity_\" there; and as the section relating to Buddhism had the\r\nadvantage, previous to publication, of being submitted to the Rev. Mr.\r\nGOGERLY, the most accomplished Pali scholar, as well as the most erudite\r\nstudent of Buddhistical literature in the island, I submit it with\r\nconfidence as an accurate summary of the distinctive views of the\r\nSinghalese on the leading doctrines of their national faith.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Part IV., c. xi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: MAX MÜLLER; _History of Sanskrit Literature_, p. 202.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Eastern Monachism_, an account of the origin, laws;\r\ndiscipline, sacred writings, mysterious rites, religious ceremonies, and\r\npresent circumstances of the Order of Mendicants, founded by Gotoma\r\nBudha. 8vo.

Pt. VII., c. i. p. 102.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: 1 _Kings_, x. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Venice, 1518.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: [Greek: Kai odontôn elephantinôn kai pithêkôn kai lithôn].\r\n[Greek: BASIA TRITÊ]. x. 22. It is to be observed, that Josephus appears\r\nto have been equally embarrassed by the unfamiliar term _tukeyim_ for\r\npeacocks. He alludes to the voyages of Solomon's merchantmen to\r\nTarshish, and says that they brought hack from thence gold and silver,\r\n_much_ ivory, apes, _and Æthiopians_--thus substituting \"slaves\" for\r\npea-fowl--\"[Greek: kai polus elephas, Aithiopes te kai pithêkoi].\"\r\nJosephus also renders the word Tarshish by \"[Greek: en tê Tarsikê\r\nlegomenê thalattê],\" an expression which shows that he thought not of\r\nthe Indian but the western Tarshish, situated in what Avienus calls the\r\n_Fretum Tartessium_, whence African slaves might have been expected to\r\ncome.--_Antiquit.

Mr. CURETON, of the British Museum, who, at my request,\r\ncollated the passage in the Chaldee and Syriac versions, assures me that\r\nin both, the terms in question bear the closest resemblance to the Tamil\r\nwords found in the Hebrew; and that in each and all of them these are of\r\nforeign importation.\r\n\r\nJ. EMERSON TENNENT.\r\n\r\nLONDON: November 28th, 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTICE TO THE SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which the first impression has been absorbed by the\r\npublic, has so shortened the interval between its appearance and that of\r\nthe present edition, that no sufficient time has been allowed for the\r\ndiscovery of errors or defects; and the work is re-issued almost as a\r\ncorrected reprint.\r\n\r\nIn the interim, however, I have ascertained, that Ribeyro's \"Historical\r\nAccount of Ceylon,\" which it was heretofore supposed had never appeared\r\nin any other than the French version of the Abbe Le Grand, and in the\r\nEnglish translation of the latter by Mr. Lee[1], was some years since\r\nprinted for the first time in the original Portuguese, from the\r\nidentical MS. presented by the author to Pedro II. in 1685. It was\r\npublished in 1836 by the Academia Real das Sciencias of Lisbon, under\r\nthe title of \"_Fatalidade Historica da Ilka de Ceilão_;\" and forms the\r\nVth volume of the a \"_Colleção de Noticias para a Historia e Geograjia\r\ndas Nações Ultramarinas_\" A fac-simile from a curious map of the island\r\nas it was then known to the Portuguese, has been included in the present\r\nedition.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Vol. II. Part vi. ch. i. p.5, note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Ibid. p. 6.]\r\n\r\nSome difficulty having been expressed to me, in identifying the ancient\r\nnames of places in India adverted to in the following pages; and\r\nmediæval charts of that country being rare, a map has been inserted in\r\nthe present edition[1], to supply the want complained of.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Vol. I. p. 330.]\r\n\r\nThe only other important change has been a considerable addition to the\r\nIndex, which was felt to be essential for facilitating reference.\r\n\r\nJ E.T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no island in the world, Great Britain itself not excepted, that\r\nhas attracted the attention of authors in so many distant ages and so\r\nmany different countries as Ceylon. There is no nation in ancient or\r\nmodern times possessed of a language and a literature, the writers of\r\nwhich have not at some time made it their theme. Its aspect, its\r\nreligion, its antiquities, and productions, have been described as well\r\nby the classic Greeks, as by those of the Lower Empire; by the Romans;\r\nby the writers of China, Burmah, India, and Kashmir; by the geographers\r\nof Arabia and Persia; by the mediæval voyagers of Italy and France; by\r\nthe annalists of Portugal and Spain; by the merchant adventurers of\r\nHolland, and by the travellers and topographers of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nBut amidst this wealth of materials as to the island, and its\r\nvicissitudes in early times, there is an absolute dearth of information\r\nregarding its state and progress during more recent periods, and its\r\nactual condition at the present day.\r\n\r\nI was made sensible of this want, on the occasion of my nomination, in\r\n1845, to an office in connection with the government of Ceylon. I found\r\nabundant details as to the capture of the maritime provinces from the\r\nDutch in 1795, in the narrative of Captain PERCIVAL[1], an officer who\r\nhad served in the expedition; and the efforts to organise the first\r\nsystem of administration are amply described by CORDINER[2], Chaplain to\r\nthe Forces; by Lord VALENTIA[3], who was then travelling in the East;\r\nand by ANTHONY BERTOLACCI[4], who acted as auditor-general to the first\r\ngovernor, Mr. North, afterwards Earl of Guilford. The story of the\r\ncapture of Kandy in 1815 has been related by an anonymous eye-witness\r\nunder the pseudonyme of PHILALETHES[5], and by MARSHALL in his\r\n_Historical Sketch_ of the conquest.[6] An admirable description of the\r\ninterior of the island, as it presented itself some forty years ago, was\r\nfurnished by Dr. DAVY[7], a brother of the eminent philosopher, who was\r\nemployed on the medical staff in Ceylon, from 1816 till 1820.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _An Account of the Island of Ceylon_, &c., by Capt. R.\r\nPERCIVAL, 4to. London, 1805.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _A Description of Ceylon_, &c., by the Rev. JAMES CORDINER,\r\nA.M. 2 vols. 4to.

Bisset.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: HENRY MARSHALL, F.R.S.E., &c. went to Ceylon as assistant\r\nsurgeon of the 89th regiment, in 1806, and from 1816 till 1821 was the\r\nsenior medical officer of the Kandyan provinces.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _An Account of the Interior of Ceylon_, &c., by JOHN DAVY,\r\nM.D. 4to, London, 1821.]\r\n\r\nHere the long series of writers is broken, just at the commencement of a\r\nperiod the most important and interesting in the history of the island.\r\nThe mountain zone, which for centuries had been mysteriously hidden from\r\nthe Portuguese and Dutch[1] was suddenly opened to British enterprise in\r\n1815. The lofty region, from behind whose barrier of hills the kings of\r\nKandy had looked down and defied the arms of three successive European\r\nnations, was at last rendered accessible by the grandest mountain road\r\nin India; and in the north of the island, the ruins of ancient cities,\r\nand the stupendous monuments of an early civilisation, were discovered\r\nin the solitudes of the great central forests. English merchants\r\nembarked in the renowned trade in cinnamon, which we had wrested from\r\nthe Dutch; and British capitalists introduced the cultivation of coffee\r\ninto the previously inaccessible highlands. Changes of equal magnitude\r\ncontributed to alter the social position of the natives; domestic\r\nslavery was extinguished; compulsory labour, previously exacted from the\r\nfree races, was abolished; and new laws under a charter of justice\r\nsuperseded the arbitrary rule of the native chiefs. In the course of\r\nless than half a century, the aspect of the country became changed, the\r\ncondition of the people was submitted to new influences; and the time\r\narrived to note the effects of this civil revolution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: VALENTYN, In his great work on the Dutch possessions in\r\nIndia, _Oud_ _en Nieuw Oost-Indien_, alludes more than once with regret\r\nto the ignorance in which his countrymen were kept as to the interior of\r\nCeylon, concerning which their only information was obtained through\r\nfugitives and spies. (Vol. v. ch. ii. p. 35; ch. xv. p. 205.)]\r\n\r\nBut on searching for books such as I expected to find, recording the\r\nphenomena consequent on these domestic and political events, I was\r\ndisappointed to discover that they were few in number and generally\r\nmeagre in information. Major FORBES, who in 1826 and for some years\r\nafterwards held a civil appointment in the Kandyan country, published an\r\ninteresting account of his observations[1]; and his work derives value\r\nfrom the attention which the author had paid to the ancient records of\r\nthe island, whose contents were then undergoing investigation by the\r\nerudite and indefatigable TURNOUR.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Eleven Years in Ceylon_, &c., by Major FORBES. 2 vols.\r\n8vo. London. 1840.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See Vol. I. Part III. ch. iii. p. 312.]\r\n\r\nIn 1843 Mr. BENNETT, a retired civil servant of the colony, who had\r\nstudied some branches of its natural history, and especially its\r\nichthyology, embodied his experiences in a volume entitled \"_Ceylon and\r\nits Capabilities_,\" containing a mass of information, somewhat defective\r\nin arrangement. These and a number of minor publications, chiefly\r\ndescriptive of sporting tours in search of elephants and deer, with\r\nincidental notices of the sublime scenery and majestic ruins of the\r\nisland, were the only modern works that treated of Ceylon; but no one of\r\nthem sufficed to furnish a connected view of the colony at the present\r\nday, contrasting its former state with the condition to which it has\r\nattained under the government of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nOn arriving in Ceylon and entering on my official functions, this\r\nabsence of local knowledge entailed frequent inconvenience. In my tours\r\nthroughout the interior, I found ancient monuments, apparently defying\r\ndecay, of which no one could tell the date or the founder; and temples\r\nand cities in ruins, whose destroyers were equally unknown. There were\r\nvast structures of public utility, on which the prosperity of the\r\ncountry had at one time been dependent; artificial lakes, with their\r\nconduits and canals for irrigation; the condition of which rendered it\r\ninteresting to ascertain the period of their formation, and the causes\r\nof their abandonment; but to every inquiry of this nature, there was the\r\nsame unvarying reply: that information regarding them might possibly be\r\nfound in the _Mahawanso_ or in some other of the native chronicles; but\r\nthat few had ever read them, and none had succeeded in reproducing them\r\nfor popular instruction.\r\n\r\nA still more serious embarrassment arose from the want of authorities to\r\nthrow light on questions that were sometimes the subject of\r\nadministrative deliberation: there were native customs which no\r\navailable materials sufficed to illustrate; and native claims, often\r\nserious in their importance, the consideration of which was obstructed\r\nby a similar dearth of authentic data. With a view to executive\r\nmeasures, I was frequently desirous of consulting the records of the two\r\nEuropean governments, under which the island had been administered for\r\n300 years before the arrival of the British; their experience might have\r\nserved as a guide, and even their failures would have pointed out errors\r\nto be avoided; but here, again, I had to encounter disappointment: in\r\nanswer to my inquiries, I was assured that _the records, both of the\r\nPortuguese and Dutch, had long since disappeared from the archives of\r\nthe colony_.\r\n\r\nTheir loss, whilst in our custody, is the more remarkable, considering\r\nthe value which was attached to them by our predecessors. The Dutch, on\r\nthe conquest of Ceylon in the seventeenth century, seized the official\r\naccounts and papers of the Portuguese; and a memoir is preserved by\r\nVALENTYN, in which the Governor, Van Goens, on handing over the command\r\nto his successor in 1663, enjoins on him the study of these important\r\ndocuments, and expresses anxiety for their careful preservation.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: VALENTYN, _Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indien_, &c., ch. xiii. p.\r\n174.]\r\n\r\nThe British, on the capture of Colombo in 1796, were equally solicitous\r\nto obtain possession of the records of the Dutch Government. By Art.\r\nXIV. of the capitulation they were required to be \"faithfully delivered\r\nover;\" and, by Art. XI., all \"surveys of the island and its coasts\" were\r\nrequired to be surrendered to the captors.[1] But, strange to say,\r\nalmost the whole of these interesting and important papers appear to\r\nhave been lost; not a trace of the Portuguese records, so far as I could\r\ndiscover, remains at Colombo; and if any vestige of those of the Dutch\r\nbe still extant, they have probably become illegible from decay and the\r\nravages of the white ants.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Amongst a valuable collection of documents presented to the\r\nRoyal Asiatic Society of London, by the late Sir Alexander Johnston,\r\nformerly Chief Justice of Ceylon, there is a volume of Dutch surveys of\r\nthe Island, containing important maps of the coast and its harbours, and\r\nplans of the great works for irrigation in the northern and eastern\r\nprovinces.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Note to the second edition_.--Since the first edition was\r\npublished, I have been told by a late officer of the Ceylon Government,\r\nthat many years ago, what remained of the Dutch records were removed\r\nfrom the record-room of the Colonial Office to the cutcherry of the\r\ngovernment agent of the western province: where some of them may still\r\nbe found.]\r\n\r\nBut the loss is not utterly irreparable; duplicates of the Dutch\r\ncorrespondence during their possession of Ceylon are carefully preserved\r\nat Amsterdam; and within the last few years the Trustees of the British\r\nMuseum purchased from the library of the late Lord Stuart de Rothesay\r\nthe Diplomatic Correspondence and Papers of SEBASTIAÕ JOZÉ CARVALHO E\r\nMELLO (Portuguese Ambassador at London and Vienna, and subsequently\r\nknown as the Marquis de Pombal), from 1738 to 1747, including sixty\r\nvolumes relating to the history of the Portuguese possessions in India\r\nand Brazil during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. Amongst the latter\r\nare forty volumes of despatches relative to India entitled _Collecçam\r\nAuthentica de todas as Leys, Regimentos, Alvarás e mais ordens que se\r\nexpediram para a India_, _desde o establecimento destas conquístas;\r\nOrdenáda por proviram de 28 de Marco de 1754_.[1] These contain the\r\ndespatches to and from the successive Captains-General and Governors of\r\nCeylon, so that, in part at least, the replacement of the records lost\r\nin the colony may be effected by transcription.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: MSS. Brit Mus. No. 20,861 to 20,900.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in their absence I had no other resource than the narratives\r\nof the Dutch and Portuguese historians, chiefly VALENTYN, DE BARROS, and\r\nDE COUTO, who have preserved in two languages the least familiar in\r\nEurope, chronicles of their respective governments, which, so far as I\r\nam aware, have never been republished in any translation.\r\n\r\nThe present volumes contain no detailed notice of the _Buddhist faith_\r\nas it exists in Ceylon, of the _Brahmanical rites,_ or of the other\r\nreligious superstitions of the island. These I have already described in\r\nmy history of _Christianity in Ceylon._[1] The materials for that work\r\nwere originally designed to form a portion of the present one; but\r\nhaving expanded to too great dimensions to be made merely subsidiary, I\r\nformed them into a separate treatise. Along with them I have\r\nincorporated facts illustrative of the national character of the\r\nSinghalese under the conjoint influences of their ancestral\r\nsuperstitions and the partial enlightenment of education and gospel\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Christianity in Ceylon: its Introduction and Progress\r\nunder the Portuguese, the Dutch, the British and American Missions; with\r\nan Historical Sketch of the Brahmanical and Buddhist Superstitons_ by\r\nSir JAMES EMERSON TENNENT. London, Murray, 1850.]\r\n\r\nRespecting the _Physical Geography_ and _Natural History_ of the colony,\r\nI found an equal want of reliable information; and every work that even\r\ntouched on the subject was pervaded by the misapprehension which I have\r\ncollected evidence to correct; that Ceylon is but a fragment of the\r\ngreat Indian continent dissevered by some local convulsion; and that the\r\nzoology and botany of the island are identical with those of the\r\nmainland.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It may seem presumptuous in me to question the accuracy of\r\nDr. DAVY'S opinion on this point (see his _Account of the Interior of\r\nCeylon, &c_., ch. iii. p. 78), but the grounds on which I venture to do\r\nso are stated, Vol. I. pp. 7, 27, 160, 178, 208, &c.]\r\n\r\nThus for almost every particular and fact, whether physical or\r\nhistorical, I have been to a great extent thrown on my own researches;\r\nand obliged to seek for information in original sources, and in French\r\nand English versions of Oriental authorities. The results of my\r\ninvestigations are embodied in the following pages; and it only remains\r\nfor me to express, in terms however inadequate, my obligations to the\r\nliterary and scientific friends by whose aid I have been enabled to\r\npursue my inquiries.\r\n\r\nAmongst these my first acknowledgments are due to Dr. TEMPLETON, of the\r\nArmy Medical Staff, for his cordial assistance in numerous departments;\r\nbut above all in relation to the physical geography and natural history\r\nof the island. Here his scientific knowledge, successfully cultivated\r\nduring a residence of nearly twelve years in Ceylon, and his intimate\r\nfamiliarity with its zoology and productions, rendered his co-operation\r\ninvaluable;--and these sections abound with evidences of the liberal\r\nextent to which his stores of information have been generously imparted.\r\nTo him and to Dr. CAMERON, of the Army Medical Staff, I am indebted for\r\nmany valuable facts and observations on tropical health and disease,\r\nembodied in the chapter on \"_Climate_.\"\r\n\r\nSir RODERICK I. MURCHISON (without committing himself as to the\r\ncontroversial portions of the chapter on the _Geology_ and _Mineralogy_\r\nof Ceylon) has done me the favour to offer some valuable suggestions,\r\nand to express his opinion as to the general accuracy of the whole.\r\n\r\nAlthough a feature so characteristic as that of its _Vegetation_ could\r\nnot possibly be omitted in a work professing to give an account of\r\nCeylon, I had neither the space nor the qualifications necessary to\r\nproduce a systematic sketch of the Botany of the island. I could only\r\nattempt to describe it as it exhibits itself to an unscientific\r\nspectator; and the notices that I have given are confined to such of the\r\nmore remarkable plants as cannot fail to arrest the attention of a\r\nstranger. In illustration of these, I have had the advantage of copious\r\ncommunications from WILLIAM FERGUSON, Esq., a gentleman attached to the\r\nSurvey Department of the Civil Service in Ceylon, whose opportunities\r\nfor observation in all parts of the island have enabled him to cultivate\r\nwith signal success his taste for botanical pursuits. And I have been\r\npermitted to submit the portion of my work which refers to this subject\r\nto the revision of the highest living authority on Indian botany, Dr.\r\nJ.D. HOOKER, of Kew.\r\n\r\nRegarding the _fauna_ of Ceylon, little has been published in any\r\ncollective form, with the exception of a volume by Dr. KELAART entitled\r\n_Prodromus Faunæ Zeilanicæ_; several valuable papers by Mr. EDGAR L.\r\nLAYARD in the _Annals and Magazine of Natural History_ for 1852 and\r\n1853; and some very imperfect lists appended to PRIDHAM'S compiled\r\naccount of the island.[1] KNOX, in the charming narrative of his\r\ncaptivity, published in the reign of Charles II., has devoted a chapter\r\nto the animals of Ceylon, and Dr. DAVY has described the principal\r\nreptiles: but with these exceptions the subject is almost untouched in\r\nworks relating to the colony. Yet a more than ordinary interest attaches\r\nto the inquiry, since Ceylon, instead of presenting, as is generally\r\nassumed, an identity between its _fauna_ and that of Southern India,\r\nexhibits a remarkable diversity of type, taken in connection with the\r\nlimited area over which they are distributed. The island, in fact, may\r\nbe regarded as the centre of a geographical circle, possessing within\r\nitself forms, whose allied species radiate far into the temperate\r\nregions of the north, as well as into Africa, Australia, and the isles\r\nof the Eastern Archipelago.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _An Historical Political, and Statistical Account of Ceylon\r\nand its Dependencies_, by C. PRIDHAM, Esq. 2 vols. 8vo. London, 1849.\r\nThe author was never, I believe, in Ceylon, but his book is a laborious\r\ncondensation of the principal English works relating to it. Its value\r\nwould have been greatly increased had Mr. Pridham accompanied his\r\nexcerpts by references to the respective authorities.]\r\n\r\nIn the chapters that I have devoted to its elucidation, I have\r\nendeavoured to interest others in the subject, by describing my own\r\nobservations and impressions, with fidelity, and with as much accuracy\r\nas may be expected from a person possessing, as I do, no greater\r\nknowledge of zoology and the other physical sciences than is ordinarily\r\npossessed by any educated gentleman. It was my good fortune, however, in\r\nmy journies to have the companionship of friends familiar with many\r\nbranches of natural science: the late Dr. GARDNER, Mr. EDGAR L. LAYARD,\r\nan accomplished zoologist, Dr. TEMPLETON, and others; and I was thus\r\nenabled to collect on the spot many interesting facts relative to the\r\nstructure and habits of the numerous tribes of animals. These, chastened\r\nby the corrections of my fellow-travellers, and established by the\r\nexamination of collections made in the colony, and by subsequent\r\ncomparison with specimens contained in museums at home, I have ventured\r\nto submit as faithful outlines of the _fauna_ of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe sections descriptive of the several classes are accompanied by\r\nlists, prepared with the assistance of scientific friends, showing the\r\nextent to which each particular branch had been investigated by\r\nnaturalists, up to the period of my departure from Ceylon at the close\r\nof 1849. These, besides their inherent interest, will, I trust,\r\nstimulate others to engage in the same pursuits, by exhibiting the\r\nchasms, which it still remains for future industry and research to fill\r\nup;--and the study of the zoology of Ceylon may thus serve as a\r\npreparative for that of Continental India, embracing, as the former\r\ndoes, much that is common to both, as well as possessing within itself a\r\nfauna peculiar to the island, that will amply repay more extended\r\nscrutiny.\r\n\r\nFrom these lists have been excluded all species regarding the\r\nauthenticity of which reasonable doubts could be entertained[1], and of\r\nsome of them, a very few have been printed in _italics_, in order to\r\ndenote the desirability of comparing them more minutely with well\r\ndetermined specimens in the great national depositories before finally\r\nincorporating them with the Singhalese catalogues.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: An exception occurs in the list of shells, prepared by Mr.\r\nSYLVANUS HANLEY, in which some whose localities are doubtful have been\r\nadmitted for reasons adduced. (See Vol. I, p. 234.)]\r\n\r\nIn the labour of collecting and verifying the facts embodied in these\r\nsections, I cannot too warmly express my thanks for the aid I have\r\nreceived from gentlemen interested in similar pursuits in Ceylon: from\r\nDr. KELAART and Mr. EDGAR L. LAYARD, as well as from officers of the\r\nCeylon Civil Service; the HON. GERALD C. TALBOT, Mr. C.E. BULLER, Mr.\r\nMERCER, Mr. MORRIS, Mr. WHITING, Major SKINNER, and Mr. MITFORD.\r\n\r\nBefore venturing to commit these chapters of my work to the press, I\r\nhave had the advantage of having portions of them read by Professor\r\nHUXLEY, Mr. MOORE, of the East India House Museum; Mr. R. PATTERSON,\r\nF.R.S., author of the _Introduction to Zoology_, and by Mr. ADAM WHITE,\r\nof the British Museum; to each of whom I am exceedingly indebted for the\r\ncare they have bestowed. In an especial degree I have to acknowledge the\r\nkindness of Dr. J.E. GRAY, F.R.S. for valuable additions and corrections\r\nin the list of the Ceylon Reptilia; and to Professor FARADAY for some\r\nnotes on the nature and qualities of the \"Serpent Stone,\"[1] submitted\r\nto him. I have recorded in its proper place my obligations to Admiral\r\nFITZROY, for his most ingenious theory in elucidation of the phenomena\r\nof the _Tides_ around Ceylon.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Vol. I. Part II. ch. iii. p. 199.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See Vol. II. Part VII. ch. i. p. 116.]\r\n\r\nThe extent to which my observations on _the Elephant_ have been carried,\r\nrequires some explanation. The existing notices of this noble creature\r\nare chiefly devoted to its habits and capabilities _in captivity_; and\r\nvery few works, with which I am acquainted, contain illustrations of its\r\ninstincts and functions when wild in its native woods. Opportunities for\r\nobserving the latter, and for collecting facts in connection with them,\r\nare abundant in Ceylon, and from the moment of my arrival, I profited by\r\nevery occasion afforded to me for studying the elephant in a state of\r\nnature, and obtaining from hunters and natives correct information as to\r\nits oeconomy and disposition. Anecdotes in connection with this subject,\r\nI received from some of the most experienced residents In the island;\r\namongst others, Major SKINNER, Captain PHILIP PAYNE GALLWEY, Mr.\r\nFAIRHOLME, Mr. CRIPPS, and Mr. MORRIS. Nor can I omit to express my\r\nacknowledgments to PROFESSOR OWEN, of the British Museum, to whom this\r\nportion of my manuscript was submitted previous to its committal to the\r\npress.\r\n\r\nIn the _historical sections_ of the work, I have been reluctantly\r\ncompelled to devote a considerable space to a narrative deduced from the\r\nancient Singhalese chronicles; into which I found it most difficult to\r\ninfuse any popular interest. But the toil was not undertaken without a\r\nmotive. The oeconomics and hierarchical institutions of Buddhism as\r\nadministered through successive dynasties, exercised so paramount an\r\ninfluence over the habits and occupations of the Singhalese people, that\r\ntheir impress remains indelible to the present day. The tenure of temple\r\nlands, the compulsory services of tenants, the extension of agriculture,\r\nand the whole system of co-operative cultivation, derived from this\r\nsource organisation and development; and the origin and objects of these\r\nare only to be rendered intelligible by an inquiry into the events and\r\ntimes in which the system took its rise. In connection with this\r\nsubject, I am indebted to the representatives of the late Mr. TURNOUR,\r\nof the Ceylon Civil Service, for access to his unpublished manuscripts;\r\nand to those portions of his correspondence with Prinsep, which relate\r\nto the researches of these two distinguished scholars regarding the Pali\r\nannals of Ceylon. I have also to acknowledge my obligations to M. JULES\r\nMOHL, the literary executor of M. E. BURNOUF, for the use of papers left\r\nby that eminent orientalist in illustration of the ancient geography of\r\nthe island, as exhibited in the works of Pali and Sanskrit writers.\r\n\r\nI have been signally assisted inn my search for materials illustrative\r\nof the social and intellectual condition of the Singhalese nation,\r\nduring the early ages of their history, by gentlemen in Ceylon, whose\r\nfamiliarity with the native languages and literature impart authority to\r\ntheir communications; by ERNEST DE SARAM WIJEYESEKERE KAROONARATNE, the\r\nMaha-Moodliar and First Interpreter to the Governor; and to Mr. DE\r\nALWIS, the erudite translator of the _Sidath Sangara._ From the Rev. Mr.\r\nGOGERLY of the Wesleyan Mission, I have received expositions of Buddhist\r\npolicy; and the Rev. R SPENCE HARDY, author of the two most important\r\nmodern works on the archæology of Buddhism[1], has done me the favour to\r\nexamine the chapter on SINGHALESE _Literature,_ and to enrich it by\r\nnumerous suggestions and additions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Oriental Monachism,_ 8vo. London, 1850; and _A Manual of\r\nBuddhism,_ 8vo. London, 1853]\r\n\r\nIn like manner I have had the advantage of communicating with MR. COOLEY\r\n(author of the _History of Maritime and Inland Discovery_) in relation\r\nto the _Mediæval History_ of Ceylon, and the period embraced by the\r\nnarrative of the Greek, Arabian, and Italian travellers, between the\r\nfifth and fifteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere recorded my obligations to Mr. WYLIE, and to his\r\ncolleague, Mr. LOCKHART of Shanghæ, for the materials of one of the most\r\ncurious chapters of my work, that which treats of the knowledge of\r\nCeylon possessed by the Chinese in the Middle Ages. This is a field\r\nwhich, so far as I know, is untouched by any previous writer on Ceylon.\r\nIn the course of my inquires, finding that Ceylon had been, from the\r\nremotest times, the point at which the merchant fleets from the Red Sea\r\nand the Persian Gulf met those from China and the Oriental Archipelago;\r\nthus effecting an exchange of merchandise from East and West; and\r\ndiscovering that the Arabian and Persian voyagers, on their return, had\r\nbrought home copious accounts of the island, it occurred to me that the\r\nChinese travellers during the same period had in all probability been\r\nequally observant and communicative, and that the results of their\r\nexperience might be found in Chinese works of the Middle Ages. Acting on\r\nthis conjecture, I addressed myself to a Chinese gentleman, WANG TAO\r\nCHUNG, who was then in England; and he, on his return to Shanghæ, made\r\nknown my wishes to Mr. WYLIE. My anticipations were more than realised\r\nby Mr. WYLIE'S researches. I received in due course, extracts from\r\nupwards of twenty works by Chinese writers, between the fifth and\r\nfifteenth centuries, and the curious and interesting facts contained in\r\nthem are embodied in the chapter devoted to that particular subject. In\r\naddition to these, the courtesy of M. STANISLAS JULIEN, the eminent\r\nFrench Sinologue, has laid me under a similar obligation for access to\r\nunpublished passages relative to Ceylon, in his translation of the great\r\nwork of HIOUEN THSANG; in his translation of the great work of HIOUEN\r\nTHSANG; descriptive of the Buddhist country of India in the seventh\r\ncentury.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mémoires sur les Contrées Occidentales_, traduites du\r\nSanscrit en Chinois, en l'an 648, par M. STANISLAS JULIEN.]\r\n\r\nIt is with pain that I advert to that portion of the section which\r\ntreats of the British rule in Ceylon; in the course of which the\r\ndiscovery of the private correspondence of the first Governor, Mr.\r\nNorth, deposited along with the Wellesley Manuscripts, in the British\r\nMuseum[1], has thrown an unexpected light over the fearful events of\r\n1803, and the massacre of the English troops then in garrison at Kandy.\r\nHitherto the honour of the British Government has been unimpeached in\r\nthese dark transactions; and the slaughter of the troops has been\r\nuniformly denounced as an evidence of the treacherous and \"tiger-like\"\r\nspirit of the Kandyan people.[2] But it is not possible now to read the\r\nnarrative of these events, as the motives and secret arrangements of the\r\nGovernor with the treacherous Minister of the king are disclosed in the\r\nprivate letters of Mr. North to the Governor-general of India, without\r\nfeeling that the sudden destruction of Major Davie's party, however\r\nrevolting the remorseless butchery by which it was achieved, may have\r\nbeen but the consummation of a revenge provoked by the discovery of the\r\ntreason concocted by the Adigar in confederacy with the representative\r\nof the British Crown. Nor is this construction weakened by the fact,\r\nthat no immediate vengeance was exacted by the Governor in expiation of\r\nthat fearful tragedy; and that the private letters of Mr. North to the\r\nMarquis of Wellesley contain avowals of ineffectual efforts to hush up\r\nthe affair, and to obtain a clumsy compromise by inducing the Kandyan\r\nking to make an admission of regret.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Additional MSS., Brit. Mus., No. 13864, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: DE QUINCEY, _collected Works_, vol. xii. p. 14.]\r\n\r\nI am aware that there are passages in the following pages containing\r\nstatements that occur more than once in the course of the work. But I\r\nfound that in dealing with so many distinct subjects the same fact\r\nbecame sometimes an indispensable illustration of more than one topic;\r\nand hence repetition was unavoidable even at the risk of tautology.\r\n\r\nI have also to apologise for variances in the spelling of proper names,\r\nboth of places and individuals, occurring in different passages. In\r\nextenuation of this, I can only plead the difficulty of preserving\r\nuniformity in matters dependent upon mere sound, and unsettled by any\r\nrecognised standard of orthography.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured in every instance to append references to other\r\nauthors, in support of statements which I have drawn from previous\r\nwriters; an arrangement rendered essential by the numerous instances in\r\nwhich errors, that nothing short of the original authorities can suffice\r\nto expose, have been reproduced and repeated by successive writers on\r\nCeylon.\r\n\r\nTo whatever extent the preparation of this work may have fallen short of\r\nits conception, and whatever its demerits in execution and style, I am\r\nnot without hope that it will still exhibit evidence that by\r\nperseverance and research I have laboured to render it worthy of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nJAMES EMERSON TENNENT.\r\n\r\nLONDON: _July 13th, 1859._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY.--GEOLOGY.--MINERALOGY.--GEMS, CLIMATE, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ASPECT.--Ceylon, from whatever direction it is approached,\r\nunfolds a scene of loveliness and grandeur unsurpassed, if it be\r\nrivalled, by any land in the universe. The traveller from Bengal,\r\nleaving behind the melancholy delta of the Ganges and the torrid coast\r\nof Coromandel; or the adventurer from Europe, recently inured to the\r\nsands of Egypt and the scorched headlands of Arabia, is alike entranced\r\nby the vision of beauty which expands before him as the island rises\r\nfrom the sea, its lofty mountains covered by luxuriant forests, and its\r\nshores, till they meet the ripple of the waves, bright with the foliage\r\nof perpetual spring.\r\n\r\nThe Brahmans designated it by the epithet of \"the resplendent,\" and in\r\ntheir dreamy rhapsodies extolled it as the region of mystery and\r\nsublimity[1]; the Buddhist poets gracefully apostrophised it as \"a pearl\r\nupon the brow of India;\" the Chinese knew it as the \"island of jewels;\"\r\nthe Greeks as the \"land of the hyacinth and the ruby;\" the Mahometans,\r\nin the intensity of their delight, assigned it to the exiled parents of\r\nmankind as a new elysium to console them for the loss of Paradise; and\r\nthe early navigators of Europe, as they returned dazzled with its gems,\r\nand laden with its costly spices, propagated the fable that far to\r\nseaward the very breeze that blew from it was redolent of perfume.[2] In\r\nlater and less imaginative times, Ceylon has still maintained the renown\r\nof its attractions, and exhibits in all its varied charms \"the highest\r\nconceivable development of Indian nature.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Ils en ont fait une espèce de paradis, et se sont imaginé\r\nque des êtres d'une nature angélique les habitaient.\"--ALBYROUNI, Traité\r\ndes Ères, &c.; REINAUD, Géographie d'Aboulféda, Introd. sec. iii. p.\r\nccxxiv. The renown of Ceylon as it reached Europe in the seventeenth\r\ncentury is thus summed up by PURCHAS in _His Pilgrimage_, b.v.c. 18, p.\r\n550:--\"The heauens with their dewes, the ayre with a pleasant\r\nholesomenesse and fragrant freshnesse, the waters in their many riuers\r\nand fountaines, the earth diuersified in aspiring hills, lowly vales,\r\nequall and indifferent plaines, filled in her inward chambers with\r\nmettalls and jewells, in her outward court and vpper face stored with\r\nwhole woods of the best cinnamons that the sunne seeth; besides fruits,\r\noranges, lemons, &c. surmounting those of Spaine; fowles and beasts,\r\nboth tame and wilde (among which is their elephant honoured by a\r\nnaturall acknowledgement of excellence of all other elephants in the\r\nworld). These all have conspired and joined in common league to present\r\nunto Zeilan the chiefe of worldly treasures and pleasures, with a long\r\nand healthfull life in the inhabitants to enjoye them. No marvell, then,\r\nif sense and sensualitie have heere stumbled on a paradise.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The fable of the \"spicy breezes\" said to blow from Arabia\r\nand India, is as old as Ctesias; and is eagerly repeated by Pliny? lib.\r\nxii. c. 42. The Greeks borrowed the tale from the Hindus, who believe\r\nthat the _Chandana_ or sandal-wood imparts its odours to the winds; and\r\ntheir poete speak of the Malayan as the westerns did of the Sabæan\r\nbreezes. But the allusion to such perfumed winds was a trope common to\r\nall the discoverers of unknown lands: the companions of Columbus\r\nascribed them to the region of the Antilles; and Verrazani and Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh scented them off the coast of Carolina. Milton borrowed\r\nfrom Diodorus Siculus, lib. iii. c. 46, the statement that:\r\n\r\n  \"Far off at sea north-east winds blow\r\n  Sabæan odours from the spicy shore\r\n  Of Araby the Blest.\"\r\n  (_P.L._ iv. 163.)\r\n\r\nAriosto employs the same imaginative embellishment to describe the\r\ncharms of Cyprus:\r\n\r\n  \"Serpillo e persa e rose e gigli e croco\r\n  Spargon dall'odorifero terreno\r\n  Tanta suavita, ch'in mar sentire\r\n  La fa ogni vento che da terra spire.\"\r\n  (_Oil. Fur._ xviii. 138.)\r\n\r\nThat some aromatic smell is perceptible far to seaward, in the vicinity\r\nof certain tropical countries, is unquestionable; and in the instance of\r\nCuba, an odour like that of violets, which is discernible two or three\r\nmiles from land, when the wind is off the shore, has been traced by\r\nPoeppig to a species of _Tetracera_, a climbing plant which diffuses its\r\nodour during the night. But in the case of Ceylon? if the existence of\r\nsuch a perfume be not altogether imaginary, the fact has been falsified\r\nby identifying the alleged fragrance with cinnamon; the truth being that\r\nthe cinnamon laurel, unless it be crushed, exhales no aroma whatever;\r\nand the peculiar odour of the spice is only perceptible after the bark\r\nhas been separated and dried.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: LASSEN, _Indische Alterthumskunde_ vol. i. p. 198.]\r\n\r\n_Picturesque Outline_.--The nucleus of its mountain masses consists of\r\ngneissic, granitic, and other crystalline rocks, which in their\r\nresistless upheaval have rent the superincumbent strata, raising them\r\ninto lofty pyramids and crags, or hurling them in gigantic fragments to\r\nthe plains below. Time and decay are slow in their assaults on these\r\ntowering precipices and splintered pinnacles; and from the absence of\r\nmore perishable materials, there are few graceful sweeps along the\r\nhigher chains or rolling downs in the lower ranges of the hills. Every\r\nbold elevation is crowned by battlemented cliffs, and flanked by chasms\r\nin which the shattered strata are seen as sharp and as rugged as if they\r\nhad but recently undergone the grand convulsion that displaced them.\r\n\r\n_Foliage and Verdure_.--The soil in these regions is consequently light\r\nand unremunerative, but the plentiful moisture arising from the\r\ninterception of every passing vapour from the Indian Ocean and the Bay\r\nof Bengal, added to the intense warmth of the atmosphere, combine to\r\nforce a vegetation so rich and luxuriant, that imagination can picture\r\nnothing more wondrous and charming; every level spot is enamelled with\r\nverdure, forests of never-fading bloom cover mountain and valley;\r\nflowers of the brightest hues grow in profusion over the plains, and\r\ndelicate climbing plants, rooted in the shelving rocks, hang in huge\r\nfestoons down the edge of every precipice.\r\n\r\nUnlike the forests of Europe, in which the excess of some peculiar trees\r\nimparts a character of monotony and graveness to the outline and\r\ncolouring, the forests of Ceylon are singularly attractive from the\r\nendless variety of their foliage, and the vivid contrast of its hues.\r\nThe mountains, especially those looking towards the east and south, rise\r\nabruptly to prodigious and almost precipitous heights above the level\r\nplains; the rivers wind through woods below like threads of silver\r\nthrough green embroidery, till they are lost in a dim haze which\r\nconceals the far horizon; and through this a line of tremulous light\r\nmarks where the sunbeams are glittering among the waves upon the distant\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nFrom age to age a scene so lovely has imparted a colouring of romance to\r\nthe adventures of the seamen who, in the eagerness of commerce, swept\r\nround the shores of India, to bring back the pearls and precious stones,\r\nthe cinnamon and odours, of Ceylon. The tales of the Arabians are\r\nfraught with the wonders of \"Serendib;\" and the mariners of the Persian\r\nGulf have left a record of their delight in reaching the calm havens of\r\nthe island, and reposing for months together in valleys where the waters\r\nof the sea were overshadowed by woods, and the gardens were blooming in\r\nperennial summer.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: REINAUD, _Relation des Voyages Arabes, &c., dans le\r\nneuvième siècle_. Paris, 1845, tom. ii. p. 129.]\r\n\r\n_Geographical Position_.--Notwithstanding the fact that the Hindus, in\r\ntheir system of the universe, had given prominent importance to Ceylon,\r\ntheir first meridian, \"the meridian of Lanka,\" being supposed to pass\r\nover the island, they propounded the most extravagant ideas, both as to\r\nits position and extent; expanding it to the proportions of a continent,\r\nand at the same time placing it a considerable distance south-east of\r\nIndia.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For a condensed account of the dimensions and position\r\nattributed to Lanka, in the Mythic Astronomy of the Hindus, see\r\nREINAUD's _Introduction to Aboulféda_, sec. iii. p. ccxvii., and his\r\n_Mémoire sur l'Inde_, p. 342; WILFORD's _Essay on the Sacred Isles of\r\nthe West_, Asiat. Researches, vol. x, p. 140.]\r\n\r\nThe native Buddhist historians, unable to confirm the exaggerations of\r\nthe Brahmans, and yet reluctant to detract from the epic renown of their\r\ncountry by disclaiming its stupendous dimensions, attempted to reconcile\r\nits actual extent with the fables of the eastern astronomers by imputing\r\nto the agency of earthquakes the submersion of vast regions by the\r\nsea.[1] But evidence is wanting to corroborate the assertion of such an\r\noccurrence, at least within the historic period; no record of it exists\r\nin the earliest writings of the Hindus, the Arabians, or Persians; who,\r\nhad the tradition survived, would eagerly have chronicled a catastrophe\r\nso appalling.[2] Geologic analogy, so far as an inference is derivable\r\nfrom the formation of the adjoining coasts, both of India and Ceylon, is\r\nopposed to its probability; and not only plants, but animals, mammalia,\r\nbirds, reptiles, and insects, exist in Ceylon, which are not to be found\r\nin the flora or fauna of the Indian continent.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: SIR WILLIAM JONES adopted the legendary opinion that Ceylon\r\n\"formerly perhaps, extended much farther to the west and south, so as to\r\ninclude Lanka or the equinoctial point of the Indian\r\nastronomers.\"--_Discourse on the Institution of a Society for inquiring\r\ninto the History, &c., of the Borderers, Mountaineers, and Islanders of\r\nAsia_.--Works, vol. i. p. 120.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese, on their arrival in Ceylon in the sixteenth century,\r\nfound the natives fully impressed by the traditions of its former extent\r\nand partial submersion; and their belief in connection with it, will be\r\nfound in the narratives and histories of De Barros and Diogo de Couto,\r\nfrom which they have been transferred, almost without abridgment, to the\r\npages of Valentyn. The substance of the native legends will be found in\r\nthe _Mahawanso_, c. xxii. p. 131; and _Rajavali_, p. 180, 190.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The first disturbance of the coast by which Ceylon is\r\nalleged to have been severed from the main land is said by the Buddhists\r\nto have taken place B.C. 2387; a second commotion is ascribed to the age\r\nof Panduwaasa, B.C. 504; and the subsidence of the shore adjacent to\r\nColombo is said to have taken place 200 years later, in the reign of\r\nDevenipiatissa, B.C. 306. The event is thus recorded in the _Rajavali_,\r\none of the sacred books of Ceylon:--\"In these days the sea was seven\r\nleagues from Kalany; but on account of what had been done to the\r\nteeroonansee (a priest who had been tortured by the king of Kalany), the\r\ngods who were charged with the conservation of Ceylon, became enraged\r\nand caused the sea to deluge the land; and as during the epoch called\r\n_duwapawrayaga_ on account of the wickedness of Rawana, 25 palaces and\r\n400,000 streets were all over-run by the sea, so now in this time of\r\nTissa Raja, 100,000 large towns, 910 fishers' villages, and 400 villages\r\ninhabited by pearl fishers, making together eleven-twelfths of the\r\nterritory of Kalany, were swallowed up by the sea.\"--_Rajavali_, vol.\r\nii. p. 180, 190.\r\n\r\nFORBES observes the coincidence that the legend of the rising of the sea\r\nin the age of Panduwaasa, 2378 B.C., very nearly concurs with the date\r\nassigned to the Deluge of Noah, 2348,--_Eleven Years in Ceylon_, vol.\r\nii. p. 258. A tradition is also extant, that a submersion took place at\r\na remote period on the east coast of Ceylon, whereby the island of\r\nGiri-dipo, which is mentioned in the first chapter of the _Mahawanso_,\r\nwas engulfed, and the dangerous rocks called the Great and Little Basses\r\nare believed to be remnants of it.--_Mahawanso_, c. i.\r\n\r\nA _résumé_ of the disquisitions which have appeared at various times as\r\nto the submersion of a part of Ceylon, will be found in a Memoir _sur la\r\nGéographie ancienne de Ceylon_, in the Journal Asiatique for January,\r\n1857, 5th ser., vol. ix. p. 12; see also TURNOUR'S _Introd. to the\r\nMahawanso_, p. xxxiv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Some of the mammalia peculiar to the island are enumerated\r\nat p. 160; birds found in Ceylon but not existing in India are alluded\r\nto at p. 178, and Dr. A. GÜNTHER, in a paper on the _Geographical\r\nDistribution of Reptiles_, in the _Mag. of Nat. Hist._ for March, 1859,\r\nsays, \"amongst these larger islands which are connected with the middle\r\npalæotropical region, none offers forms so different from the continent\r\nand other islands as Ceylon. It might be considered the Madagascar of\r\nthe Indian region. We not only find there peculiar genera and species,\r\nnot again to be recognised in other parts; but even many of the common\r\nspecies exhibit such remarkable varieties, as to afford ample means for\r\ncreating new nominal species,\" p. 280. The difference exhibited between\r\nthe insects of Ceylon and those of Hindustan and the Dekkan are noticed\r\nby Mr. Walker in the present work, p. ii. ch. vii, vol. i. p. 270. See\r\non this subject RITTER'S _Erdkunde_, vol. iv. p. 17.]\r\n\r\nStill in the infancy of geographical knowledge, and before Ceylon had\r\nbeen circumnavigated by Europeans, the mythical delusions of the Hindus\r\nwere transmitted to the West, and the dimensions of the island were\r\nexpanded till its southern extremity fell below the equator, and its\r\nbreadth was prolonged till it touched alike on Africa and China.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: GIBBON, ch. xxiv.]\r\n\r\nThe Greeks who, after the Indian conquests of Alexander, brought back\r\nthe earliest accounts of the East, repeated them without material\r\ncorrection, and reported the island to be nearly twenty times its actual\r\nextent. Onesicritus, a pilot of the expedition, assigned to it a\r\nmagnitude of 5000 stadia, equal to 500 geographical miles.[1]\r\nEratosthenes attempted to fix its position, but went so widely astray\r\nthat his first (that is his most southern) parallel passed through it\r\nand the \"Cinnamon Land,\" the _Regio Cinnamomifera_, on the east coast of\r\nAfrica.[2] He placed Ceylon at the distance of seven days' sail from the\r\nsouth of India, and he too assigned to its western coast an extent of\r\n5000 stadia.[3] Both those authorities are quoted by Strabo, who says\r\nthat the size of Taprobane was not less than that of Britain.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: STRABO, lib. v. Artemidorus (100 B.C.), quoted by Stephanus\r\nof Byzantium, gives to Ceylon a length of 7000 stadia and a breadth of\r\n500.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: STRABO, lib. ii. c. i. s. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The text of Strabo showing this measure makes it in some\r\nplaces 8000 (Strabo, lib. v.); and Pliny, quoting Eratosthenes, makes it\r\n7000.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: STRABO, lib. ii. c. v. s. 32. Aristotle appears to have had\r\nmore correct information, and says Ceylon was not so large as\r\nBritain.--_De Mundo_ ch. iii.]\r\n\r\nThe round numbers employed by those authors, and by the Greek\r\ngeographers generally, who borrow from them, serve to show that their\r\nknowledge was merely collected from rumours; and that in all probability\r\nthey were indebted for their information to the stories of Arabian or\r\nHindu sailors returning from the Eastern seas.\r\n\r\nPliny learned from the Singhalese Ambassador who visited Rome in the\r\nreign of Claudius, that the breadth of Ceylon was 10,000 stadia from\r\nwest to east; and Ptolemy fully developed the idea of his predecessors,\r\nthat it lay opposite to the \"Cinnamon Land,\" and assigned to it a length\r\nfrom north to south of nearly _fifteen degrees_, with a breadth of\r\n_eleven_, an exaggeration of the truth nearly twenty-fold.[1]\r\nAgathemerus copies Ptolemy; and the plain and sensible author of the\r\n\"Periplus\" (attributed to Arrian), still labouring with the delusion of\r\nthe magnitude of Ceylon, makes it stretch almost to the opposite coast\r\nof Africa.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: PTOLEMY, lib. vii. c. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: ARRIAN, _Periplus_, p. 35. Marcianus Heracleota (whose\r\nPeriplus has been reprinted by HUDSON, in the same collection from which\r\nI have made the reference to that of Arrian) gives to Ceylon a length of\r\n9500 stadia with a breadth of 7500.--MAR. HER. p. 26.]\r\n\r\nThese extravagant ideas of the magnitude of Ceylon were not entirely\r\nremoved till many centuries later. The Arabian geographers, Massoudi,\r\nEdrisi, and Aboulfeda, had no accurate data by which to correct the\r\nerrors of their Greek predecessors. The maps of the fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries repeated their distortions[1]; and Marco Polo, in\r\nthe fourteenth century, who gives the island the usual exaggerated\r\ndimensions, yet informs us that it is now but one half the size it had\r\nbeen at a former period, the rest having been engulfed by the sea.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For an account of Ceylon as it is figured in the\r\n_Mappe-mondes_ of the Middle Ages, see the _Essai_ of the VICOMTE DE\r\nSANTAREM, _Sur la Cosmographie et Cartographie_, tom. iii. p. 335, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: MARCO POLO, p. 2, c. 148. A later authority than Marco\r\nPolo, PORCACCHI, in his _Isolario_, or \"Description of the most\r\ncelebrated Islands in the World,\" which was published at Venice in A.D.\r\n1576, laments his inability even at that time to obtain any authentic\r\ninformation as to the boundaries and dimensions of Ceylon; and, relying\r\non the representations of the Moors, who then carried on an active trade\r\naround its coasts, he describes it as lying under the equinoctial line,\r\nand possessing a circuit of 2100 miles. \"Ella gira di circuito, secondo\r\nil calcole fatto da Mori, che modernamente l'hanno nauigato\r\nd'ogn'intorno due mila et cento miglia et corre mæstro e sirocco; et per\r\nil mezo d'essa passa la linea equinottiale et è el principio del primo\r\nclima al terzo paralello.\"--_L'Isole piu Famose del Monde, descritte da_\r\nTHOMASO PORCACCHI, lib. iii. p. 30.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the uncertainty thrown over the geography of the island by\r\nerroneous and conflicting accounts, that grave doubts came to be\r\nentertained of its identity, and from the fourteenth century, when the\r\nattention of Europe was re-directed to the nascent science of geography,\r\ndown to the close of the seventeenth, it remained a question whether\r\nCeylon or Sumatra was the Taprobane of the Greeks.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: GIBBON states, that \"Salmasius and most of the ancients\r\nconfound the islands of Ceylon and Sumatra.\"--_Decl. and Fall_ ch. xl.\r\nThis is a mistake. Saumaise was one of those who maintained a correct\r\nopinion; and, as regards the \"ancients,\" they had very little knowledge\r\nof _Further India_ to which Sumatra belongs; but so long as Greek and\r\nRoman literature maintained their influence, no question was raised as\r\nto the identity of Ceylon and Taprobane. Even in the sixth century\r\nCosmas Indicopleustes declares unhesitatingly that the Sielediva of the\r\nIndians was the Taprobane of the Greeks.\r\n\r\nIt was only on emerging from the general ignorance of the Middle Ages\r\nthat the doubt was first promulgated. In the Catalan Map of A.D. 1375,\r\nentitled _Image du Monde_, Ceylon is omitted, and Taprobane is\r\nrepresented by Sumatra (MALTE BRUN, _Hist. de Geogr._ vol. i, p. 318);\r\nin that of _Fra Mauro_, the Venetian monk, A.D. 1458, Seylan is given,\r\nbut _Taprobane_ is added over _Sumatra_. A similar error appears in the\r\n_Mappe-monde,_ by RUYCH, in the Ptolemy of A.D. 1508, and in the\r\nwritings of the geographers of the sixteenth century, GEMMA FRISIUS,\r\nSEBASTIAN MUNSTER, RAMUSIO, JUL. SCALIGER, ORTELIUS, and MERCATOR. The\r\nsame view was adopted by the Venetian NICOLA DI CONTI, in the first half\r\nof the fifteenth century, by the Florentine ANDREA CORSALI, MAXIMILIANUS\r\nTRANSYLVANUS, VARTHEMA, and PIGAFETTA. The chief cause of this\r\nperplexity was, no doubt, the difficulty of reconciling the actual\r\nposition and size of Ceylon with the dimensions and position assigned to\r\nit by Strabo and Ptolemy, the latter of whom, by an error which is\r\nelsewhere explained, extended the boundary of the island far to the east\r\nof its actual site. But there was a large body of men who rejected the\r\nclaim of Sumatra, and DE BARROS, SALMASIUS, BOCHART CLUVERIUS,\r\nCELLARIUS, ISAAC VOSSIUS and others, maintained the title of Ceylon. A\r\n_Mappe-monde_ of A.D. 1417, preserved in the Pitti Palace at Florence\r\ncompromises the dispute by designating Sumatra _Taprobane Major_. The\r\ncontroversy came to an end at the beginning of the eighteenth century,\r\nwhen the overpowering authority of DELISLE resolved the doubt, and\r\nconfirmed the modern Ceylon as the Taprobane of antiquity. WILFORD, in\r\nthe _Asiatic Researches_ (vol. x. p. 140), still clung to the opposite\r\nopinion, and KANT undertook to prove that Taprobane was Madagascar.]\r\n\r\n_Latitude and Longitude_.--There has hitherto been considerable\r\nuncertainty as to the position assigned to Ceylon in the various maps\r\nand geographical notices of the island: these have been corrected by\r\nmore recent observations, and its true place has been ascertained to be\r\nbetween 5° 55' and 9° 51' north latitude, and 79° 41' 40\" and 81° 54'\r\n50\" east longitude. Its extreme length from north to south, from Point\r\nPalmyra to Dondera Head, is 271-1/2 miles; its greatest width 137-1/2\r\nmiles, from Colombo on the west coast to Sangemankande on the east; and\r\nits area, including its dependent islands, 25,742 miles, or about\r\none-sixth smaller than Ireland.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Down to a very recent period no British colony was more\r\nimperfectly surveyed and mapped than Ceylon; but since the recent\r\npublication by Arrowsmith of the great map by General Fraser, the\r\nreproach has been withdrawn, and no dependency of the Crown is more\r\nrichly provided in this particular. In the map of Schneider, the\r\nGovernment engineer in 1813, two-thirds of the Kandyan Kingdom are a\r\nblank; and in that of the Society for the Diffusion of Knowledge,\r\nre-published so late as 1852, the rich districts of Neuera-kalawa and\r\nthe Wanny, in which there are innumerable villages (and scarcely a\r\nhill), are marked as \"_unknown mountainous region_.\" General Fraser,\r\nafter the devotion of a lifetime to the labour, has produced a survey\r\nwhich, in extent and minuteness of detail, stands unrivalled. In this\r\ngreat work he had the co-operation of Major Skinner and of Captain\r\nGallwey, and to these two gentlemen the public are indebted for the\r\ngreater portion of the field-work and the trigonometrical operations. To\r\njudge of the difficulties which beset such an undertaking, it must be\r\nborne in mind that till very recently travelling in the interior of\r\nCeylon was all but impracticable, in a country unopened even by bridle\r\nroads, across unbridged rivers, over mountains never trod by the foot of\r\na European, and amidst precipices inaccessible to all but the most\r\ncourageous and prudent. Add to this that the country is densely covered\r\nwith forest and jungle, with trees a hundred feet high, from which here\r\nand there the branches had to be cleared to obtain a sight of the signal\r\nstations. The triangulation was carried on amidst privations,\r\ndiscomfort, and pestilence, which frequently prostrated the whole party,\r\nand forced their attendants to desert them rather than encounter such\r\nhardships and peril. The materials collected by the colleagues of\r\nGeneral Fraser under these discouragements have been worked up by him\r\nwith consummate skill and perseverance. The base line, five and a\r\nquarter miles in length, was measured in 1845 in the cinnamon plantation\r\nat Kaderani, to the north of Colombo, and its extremities are still\r\nmarked by two towers, which it was necessary to raise to the height of\r\none hundred feet, to enable them to be discerned above the surrounding\r\nforests. These it is to be hoped will be carefully kept from decay, as\r\nthey may again be called into requisition.\r\n\r\nAs regards the sea line of Ceylon, an admirable chart of the West coast,\r\nfrom Adam's Bridge to Dondera Head, has been published by the East India\r\nCompany from a survey in 1845. But information is sadly wanted as to the\r\nEast and North, of which no accurate charts exist, except of a few\r\nunconnected points, such as the harbour of Trincomalie.]\r\n\r\n_General Form_.--In its general outline the island resembles a pear--and\r\nsuggests to its admiring inhabitants the figure of those pearls which\r\nfrom their elongated form are suspended from the tapering end. When\r\noriginally upheaved above the ocean its shape was in all probability\r\nnearly circular, with a prolongation in the direction of north-east. The\r\nmountain zone in the south, covering an area of about 4212 miles[1], may\r\nthen have formed the largest proportion of its entire area--and the belt\r\nof low lands, known as the Maritime Provinces, consists to a great\r\nextent of soil from the disintegration of the gneiss, detritus from the\r\nhills, alluvium carried down the rivers, and marine deposits gradually\r\ncollected on the shore. But in addition to these, the land has for ages\r\nbeen slowly rising from the sea, and terraces abounding in marine shells\r\nimbedded in agglutinated sand occur in situations far above high-water\r\nmark. Immediately inland from Point de Galle, the surface soil rests on\r\na stratum of decomposing coral; and sea shells are found at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the shore. Further north at Madampe, between\r\nChilaw and Negombo, the shells of pearl oysters and other bivalves are\r\nturned up by the plough more than ten miles from the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This includes not only the lofty mountains suitable for the\r\ncultivation of coffee, but the lower ranges and spurs which connect them\r\nwith the maritime plains.]\r\n\r\nThese recent formations present themselves in a still more striking form\r\nin the north of the island, the greater portion of which may be regarded\r\nas the conjoint production of the coral polypi, and the currents, which\r\nfor the greater portion of the year set impetuously towards the south.\r\nComing laden with alluvial matter collected along the coast of\r\nCoromandel, and meeting with obstacles south of Point Calimere, they\r\nhave deposited their burthens on the coral reefs round Point Pedro; and\r\nthese gradually raised above the sea-level, and covered deeply by sand\r\ndrifts, have formed the peninsula of Jaffna and the plains that trend\r\nwestward till they unite with the narrow causeway of Adam's\r\nBridge--itself raised by the same agencies, and annually added to by the\r\ninfluences of the tides and monsoons.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The barrier known as Adam's Bridge, which obstructs the\r\nnavigation of the channel between Ceylon and Ramnad, consists of several\r\nparallel ledges of conglomerate and sandstone, hard at the surface, and\r\ngrowing coarse and soft as it descends till it rests on a bank of sand,\r\napparently accumulated by the influence of the currents at the change of\r\nthe monsoons. See an _Essay_ by Captain STEWART _on the Paumbem\r\nPassage_. Colombo, 1837. See Vol. II. p. 554.]\r\n\r\nOn the north-west side of the island, where the currents are checked by\r\nthe obstruction of Adam's Bridge, and still water prevails in the Gulf\r\nof Manaar, these deposits have been profusely heaped, and the low sandy\r\nplains have been proportionally extended; whilst on the south and east,\r\nwhere the current sweeps unimpeded along the coast, the line of the\r\nshore is bold and occasionally rocky.\r\n\r\nThis explanation of the accretion and rising of the land is somewhat\r\nopposed to the popular belief that Ceylon was torn from the main land of\r\nIndia[1] by a convulsion, during which the Gulf of Manaar and the narrow\r\nchannel at Paumbam were formed by the submersion of the adjacent land.\r\nThe two theories might be reconciled by supposing the sinking to have\r\noccurred at an early period, and to have been followed by the uprising\r\nstill in progress. But on a closer examination of the structure and\r\ndirection of the mountain system of Ceylon, it exhibits no traces of\r\nsubmersion. It seems erroneous to regard it as a prolongation of the\r\nIndian chains; it lies far to the east of the line formed by the Ghauts\r\non either side of the peninsula, and any affinity which it exhibits is\r\nrather with the equatorial direction of the intersecting ranges of the\r\nNilgherries and the Vindhya. In their geological elements there is,\r\ndoubtless, a similarity between the southern extremity of India and the\r\nelevated portions of Ceylon; but there are also many important\r\nparticulars in which their specific differences are irreconcilable with\r\nthe conjecture of previous continuity. In the north of Ceylon there is a\r\nmarked preponderance of aqueous strata, which are comparatively rare in\r\nthe vicinity of Cape Comorin; and whilst the rocks of the former are\r\nentirely destitute of organic remains[2]; fossils, both terrestrial and\r\npelagic, have been found in the Eastern Ghauts, and sandstone, in some\r\ninstances, overlays the primary rocks which compose them. The rich and\r\nblack soil to the south of the Nilgherries presents a strong contrast to\r\nthe red and sandy earth of the opposite coast; and both in the flora and\r\nfauna of the island there are exceptional peculiarities which suggest a\r\ndistinction between it and the Indian continent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: LASSEN, _Indische Alterthumskunde_, vol. i. p. 193.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: At Cutchavelly, north of Trincomalie, there exists a bed of\r\ncalcareous clay, in which shells and crustaceans are found in a\r\nsemi-fossilised state; but they are all of recent species, principally\r\n_Macrophthalmus_ and _Scylla_. The breccia at Jaffna contains recent\r\nshells, as does also the arenaceous strata on the western coast of\r\nManaar and in the neighbourhood of Galle. The existence of the\r\nfossilised crustaceans in the north of Ceylon was known to the early\r\nArabian navigators. Abou-zeyd describes them as, \"Un animal de mer qui\r\nresemble à l'écrevisse; quand cet animal sort de la mer, _il se\r\nconvertit en pierre_.\" See REINAUD, _Voyages faits par les Arabes_, vol.\r\ni. p. 21. The Arabs then; and the Chinese at the present day, use these\r\npetrifactions when powdered as a specific for diseases of the eye.]\r\n\r\n_Mountain System_.--At whatever period the mountains of Ceylon may have\r\nbeen raised, the centre of maximum energy must have been in the vicinity\r\nof Adam's Peak, the group immediately surrounding which has thus\r\nacquired an elevation of from six to eight thousand feet above the\r\nsea.[1] The uplifting force seems to have been exerted from south-west\r\nto north-east; and although there is much confusion in many of the\r\nintersecting ridges, the lower ranges, especially those to the south and\r\nwest of Adam's Peak, from Saffragam to Ambogammoa, manifest a remarkable\r\ntendency to run in parallel ridges in a direction from south-east to\r\nnorth-west.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The following are the heights of a few of the most\r\nremarkable places:--\r\n\r\n  Pedrotallagalla        8280 English feet.\r\n  Kirrigalpotta          7810 English feet.\r\n  Totapella              7720 English feet.\r\n  Adam's Peak            7420 English feet.\r\n  Nammoone-Koolle        6740 English feet.\r\n  Plain of Neuera-ellia  6210 English feet.]\r\n\r\nTowards the north, on the contrary, the offsets of the mountain system,\r\nwith the exception of those which stretch towards Trincomalie, radiate\r\nto short distances in various directions, and speedily sink down to the\r\nlevel of the plain. Detached hills of great altitude are rare, the most\r\ncelebrated being that of Mihintala, which overlooks the sacred city of\r\nAnarajapoora: and Sigiri is the only example in Ceylon of those solitary\r\nacclivities, which form so remarkable a feature in the table-land of the\r\nDekkan, starting abruptly from the plain with scarped and perpendicular\r\nsides, and converted by the Indians into strongholds, accessible only by\r\nprecipitous pathways, or steps hewn in the solid rock.\r\n\r\nThe crest of the Ceylon mountains is of stratified crystalline rock,\r\nespecially gneiss, with extensive veins of quartz, and through this the\r\ngranite has been everywhere intruded, distorting the riven strata, and\r\ntilting them at all angles to the horizon. Hence at the abrupt\r\nterminations of some of the chains in the district of Saffragam,\r\nplutonic rocks are seen mingled with the dislocated gneiss. Basalt makes\r\nits appearance both at Galle and Trincomalie. In one place to the east\r\nof Pettigalle-Kanda, the rocks have been broken up in such confusion as\r\nto resemble the effect of volcanic action--huge masses overhang each\r\nother like suddenly-cooled lava; and Dr. Gygax, a Swiss mineralogist,\r\nwho was employed by the Government in 1847 to examine and report on the\r\nmineral resources of the district, stated, on his return, that having\r\nseen the volcanoes of the Azores, he found a \"strange similarity at this\r\nspot to one of the semi-craters round the trachytic ridge of\r\nSeticidadas, in the island of St. Michael.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Beyond the very slightest symptoms of disturbance,\r\nearthquakes are unknown in Ceylon: and although its geology exhibits\r\nlittle evidence of volcanic action (with the exception of the basalt,\r\nwhich occasionally presents an appearance approaching to that of lava),\r\nthere are some other incidents that seem to suggest the vicinity of\r\nfire; more particularly the occurrence of springs of high temperature,\r\none at Badulla, one at Kitool, near Bintenne, another near Yavi Ooto, in\r\nthe Veddah country, and a fourth at Cannea, near Trincomalie. I have\r\nheard of another near the Patipal Aar south of Batticaloa. The water in\r\neach is so pure and free from salts that the natives make use of it for\r\nall domestic purposes. Dr. Davy adverts to another indication of\r\nvolcanic agency in the sudden and profound depth of the noble harbour at\r\nTrincomalie, which even close by the beach is said to have been hitherto\r\nunfathomed.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards believed Ceylon to be volcanic; and ARGENSOLA, in his\r\n_Conquista de las Malucas_, Madrid, 1609, says it produced liquid\r\nbitumen and sulphur:--\"Fuentes de betùn liquido y bolcanes de perpetuas\r\nllamas que arrojan entre las asperezas de la montaña losas de\r\naçufre.\"--Lib. v. p. 184. It is needless to say that this is altogether\r\nimaginary.]\r\n\r\n_Gneiss_.--The great geological feature of the island is, however, the\r\nprofusion of gneiss, and the various new forms arising from its\r\ndisintegration. In the mountains, with the exception of occasional beds\r\nof dolomite, no more recent formations overlie it; from the period of\r\nits first upheaval, the gneiss has undergone no second submersion, and\r\nthe soil which covers it in these lofty altitudes is formed almost\r\nentirely by its decay.\r\n\r\nIn the lower ranges of the hills, gigantic portions of gneiss rise\r\nconspicuously, so detached from the original chain and so rounded by the\r\naction of the atmosphere, aided by their concentric lamellation, that\r\nbut for their prodigious dimensions, they might be regarded as boulders.\r\nClose under one of these cylindrical masses, 600 feet in height, and\r\nupwards of three miles in length, the town of Kornegalle, one of the\r\nancient capitals of the island, has been built; and the great temple of\r\nDambool, the most remarkable Buddhist edifice in Ceylon, is constructed\r\nunder the hollow edge of another, its gilded roof being formed by the\r\ninverted arch of the natural stone. The tendency of the gneiss to assume\r\nthese concentric and almost circular forms has been taken advantage of\r\nfor this purpose by the Singhalese priests, and some of their most\r\nvenerated temples are to be found under the shadow of the overarching\r\nstrata, to the imperishable nature of which the priests point as\r\nsymbolical of the eternal duration of their faith.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The concentric lamellar strata of the gneiss sometimes\r\nextend with a radius so prolonged that slabs may be cut from them and\r\nused in substitution for beams of timber, and as such they are\r\nfrequently employed in the construction of Buddhist temples. At\r\nPiagalla, on the road between Galle and Colombo, within about four miles\r\nof Caltura, there is a gneiss hill of this description on which a temple\r\nhas been so erected. In this particular rock the garnets usually found\r\nin gneiss are replaced by rubies, and nothing can exceed the beauty of\r\nthe hand-specimens procurable from a quarry close to the high road on\r\nthe landward side; in which, however, the gems are in every case reduced\r\nto splinters.]\r\n\r\n_Laterite or \"Cabook_.\"--A peculiarity, which is one of the first to\r\nstrike a stranger who lands at Galle or Colombo, is the bright red\r\ncolour of the streets and roads, contrasting vividly with the verdure of\r\nthe trees, and the ubiquity of the fine red dust which penetrates every\r\ncrevice and imparts its own tint to every neglected article. Natives\r\nresident in these localities are easily recognisable elsewhere, by the\r\ngeneral hue of their dress. This is occasioned by the prevalence along\r\nthe western coast of _laterite_, or, as the Singhalese call it,\r\n_cabook_, a product of disintegrated gneiss, which being subjected to\r\ndetrition communicates its hue to the soil.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: According to the _Mahawanso_ \"Tamba-panni,\" one of those\r\nnames by which Ceylon was anciently called, originated in an incident\r\nconnected with the invasion of Wijayo, B.C. 543, whose followers,\r\n\"exhausted by sea-sickness and faint from weakness, sat down at the spot\r\nwhere they had landed out of the vessels, supporting themselves on the\r\npalms of their hands pressed to the ground, whence the name of\r\nTamba-pannyo, '_copper-palmed_,' from the colour of the soil. From this\r\ncircumstance that wilderness obtained the name of Tamba-panni; and from\r\nthe same cause also this renowned land became celebrated under that\r\nname.\"--TURNOUR'S _Mahawanso_, ch. vi. p. 50. From Tamba-panni came the\r\nGreek name for Ceylon, _Taprobane_. Mr. de Alwis has corrected an error\r\nin this passage of Mr. Turnour's translation; the word in the original,\r\nwhich he took for _Tamba-panniyo_, or \"copper-palmed,\" being in reality\r\n_tamba-vanna_, or \"copper-coloured.\" Colonel Forbes questions the\r\naccuracy of this derivation, and attributes the name to the _tamana_\r\ntrees; from the abundance of which he says many villages in Ceylon, as\r\nwell as a district in southern India, have been similarly called.\r\n(_Eleven Years in Ceylon_, vol. i. p. 10.) I have not succeeded in\r\ndiscovering what tree is designated by this name, nor does it occur in\r\nMOON'S _List of Ceylon Plants_. On the southern coast of India a river,\r\nwhich flows from the ghats to the sea, passing Tinnevelly, is called\r\nTambapanni. Tambapanni, as the designation of Ceylon, occurs in the\r\ninscription on the rock of Girnar in Guzerat, deciphered by Prinsep,\r\ncontaining an edict by Asoka relative to the medical administration of\r\nIndia for the relief both of man and beast, (_Asiat. Soc. Journ. Beng._\r\nvol. vii. p. 158.)]\r\n\r\nThe transformation of gneiss into laterite in these localities has been\r\nattributed to the circumstance, that those sections of the rock which\r\nundergo transition exhibit grains of magnetic iron ore partially\r\ndisseminated through them; and the phenomenon of the conversion has been\r\nexplained not by recurrence to the ordinary conception of mere\r\nweathering, which is inadequate, but to the theory of catalytic action,\r\nregard being had to the peculiarity of magnetic iron when viewed in its\r\nchemical formula.[1] The oxide of iron thus produced communicates its\r\ncolouring to the laterite, and in proportion as felspar and hornblende\r\nabound in the gneiss, the cabook assumes respectively a white or yellow\r\nhue. So ostensible is the series of mutations, that in ordinary\r\nexcavations there is no difficulty in tracing a continuous connection\r\nwithout definite lines of demarcation between the soil and the laterite\r\non the one hand, and the laterite and gneiss rock on the other.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From a paper read to the Royal Physical Society of\r\nEdinburgh by the Rev. J.G. Macvicar, D.D.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: From a paper on the Geology of Ceylon, by Dr. Gardner, in\r\nthe Appendix to Lee's translation of RIBEYRO'S _History of Ceylon_, p,\r\n206. The earliest and one of the ablest essays on the geological system\r\nand mineralogy of Ceylon will be found in DAVY'S _Account of the\r\nInterior of Ceylon_, London, 1821. It has, however, been corrected and\r\nenlarged by recent investigators.]\r\n\r\nThe tertiary rocks which form such remarkable features in the geology of\r\nother countries are almost unknown in Ceylon; and the \"clay-slate,\r\nSilurian, old red sandstone, carboniferous, new red sandstone, oolitic,\r\nand cretaceous systems\" have not as yet been recognised in any part of\r\nthe island.[1] Crystalline limestone in some places overlies the gneiss,\r\nand is worked for oeconomical purposes in the mountain districts where\r\nit occurs.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. Gardner.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In the maritime provinces lime for building is obtained by\r\nburning the coral and madrepore, which for this purpose is industriously\r\ncollected by the fishermen during the intervals when the wind is off\r\nshore.]\r\n\r\nAlong the western coast, from Point-de-Galle to Chilaw, breccia is found\r\nnear the shores, from the agglutination of corallines and shells mixed\r\nwith sand, and the disintegrated particles of gneiss. These beds present\r\nan appearance very closely resembling a similar rock, in which human\r\nremains have been found imbedded, at the north-east of Guadaloupe, now\r\nin the British Museum.[1] Incorporated with them there are minute\r\nfragments of sapphires, rubies, and tourmaline, showing that the sand of\r\nwhich the breccia is composed has been washed down by the rivers from\r\nthe mountain zone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. Gardner.]\r\n\r\nNORTHERN PROVINCES.--_Coral Formation_.--But the principal scene of the\r\nmost recent formations is the extreme north of the island, with the\r\nadjoining peninsula of Jaffna. Here the coral rocks abound far above\r\nhigh-water mark, and extend across the island where the land has been\r\ngradually upraised, from the eastern to the western shore. The\r\nfortifications of Jaffna were built by the Dutch, from blocks of breccia\r\nquarried far from the sea, and still exhibit, in their worn surface, the\r\noutline of the shells and corallines of which they mainly consist. The\r\nroads, in the absence of more solid substances, are metalled with the\r\nsame material; as the only other rock which occurs is a loose\r\ndescription of conglomerate, similar to that at Adam's Bridge and\r\nManaar.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of the gradual upheaval of these strata is sufficiently\r\nattested by the position in which they appear, and their altitude above\r\nhigh-water mark; but, in close contiguity with them, an equally striking\r\nevidence presents itself in the fact that, at various points of the\r\nwestern coast, between the island of Manaar and Karativoe, the natives,\r\nin addition to fishing for chank shells[1] in the sea, dig them up in\r\nlarge quantities from beneath the soil on the adjacent shores, in which\r\nthey are deeply imbedded[2], the land having since been upraised.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Turbinella rapa_, formerly known as _Voluta gravis_ used\r\nby the people of India to be sawn into bangles and anklets.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In 1845 an antique iron anchor was found under the soil at\r\nthe northwestern point of Jaffna, of such size and weight as to show\r\nthat it must have belonged to a ship of much greater tonnage than any\r\nwhich the depth of water would permit to navigate the channel at the\r\npresent day.]\r\n\r\nThe sand, which covers a vast extent of the peninsula of Jaffna, and in\r\nwhich the coco-nut and Palmyra-palm grow freely, has been carried by the\r\ncurrents from the coast of India, and either flung upon the northern\r\nbeach in the winter months, or driven into the lake during the\r\nsouth-west monsoon, and thence washed on shore by the ripple, and\r\ndistributed by the wind.\r\n\r\nThe arable soil of Jaffna is generally of a deep red colour, from the\r\nadmixture of iron, and, being largely composed of lime from the\r\ncomminuted coral, it is susceptible of the highest cultivation, and\r\nproduces crops of great luxuriance. This tillage is carried on\r\nexclusively by irrigation from innumerable wells, into which the water\r\nrises fresh through the madrepore and sand; there being no streams in\r\nthe district, unless those percolations can be so called which make\r\ntheir way underground, and rise through the sands on the margin of the\r\nsea at low water.\r\n\r\n_Wells in the Coral Rock_.--These phenomena occur at Jaffna, in\r\nconsequence of the rocks being magnesian limestone and coral, overlying\r\na bed of sand, and in some places, where the soil is light, the surface\r\nof the ground is a hollow arch, so that it resounds as if a horse's\r\nweight were sufficient to crush it inwards. This is strikingly\r\nperceptible in the vicinity of the remarkable well at Potoor[1], on the\r\nwest side of the road leading from Jaffna to Point Pedro, where the\r\nsurface of the surrounding country is only about fifteen feet above the\r\nsea-level. The well, however, is upwards of 140 feet in depth; the water\r\nfresh at the surface, brackish lower down, and intensely salt below.\r\nAccording to the universal belief of the inhabitants, it is an\r\nunderground pool, which communicates with the sea by a subterranean\r\nchannel bubbling out on the shore near Kangesentorre, about seven miles\r\nto the north-west.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For the particulars of this singular well, see Vol. II. Pt.\r\nIX. ch. vi. p. 536.]\r\n\r\nA similar subterranean stream is said to conduct to the sea from another\r\nsingular well near Tillipalli, in sinking which the workmen, at the\r\ndepth of fourteen feet, came to the ubiquitous coral, the crust of which\r\ngave way, and showed a cavern below containing the water they were in\r\nsearch of, with a depth of more than thirty-three feet. It is remarkable\r\nthat the well at Tillipalli preserves its depth at all seasons alike,\r\nuninfluenced by rains or drought; and a steam-engine erected at Potoor,\r\nwith the intention of irrigating the surrounding lands, failed to lower\r\nit in any perceptible degree.\r\n\r\nOther wells, especially some near the coast, maintain their level with\r\nsuch uniformity as to be inexhaustible at any season, even after a\r\nsuccession of years of drought--a fact from which it may fairly be\r\ninferred that their supply is chiefly derived by percolation from the\r\nsea.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: DARWIN, in his admirable account of the coral formations of\r\nthe Pacific and Indian oceans, has propounded a theory as to the\r\nabundance of fresh water in the atolls and islands on coral reefs,\r\nfurnished by wells which ebb and flow with the tides. Assuming it to be\r\nimpossible to separate salt from sea water by filtration, he suggests\r\nthat the porous coral rock being permeated by salt water, the rain which\r\nfalls on the surface must sink to the level of the surrounding sea, \"and\r\nmust accumulate there, displacing an equal bulk of sea water--and as the\r\nportion of the latter in the lower part of the great sponge-like mass\r\nrises and falls with the tides, so will the fresh water near the\r\nsurface.\"--_Naturalist's Journal_, ch. xx. But subsequent experiments\r\nhave demonstrated that the idea of separating the salt by filtration is\r\nnot altogether imaginary; as Darwin seems to have then supposed; and Mr.\r\nWITT, in a remarkable paper _On a peculiar power possessed by Porous\r\nMedia of removing matters from solution in water_, has since succeeded\r\nin showing that \"water containing considerable quantities of saline\r\nmatter in solution may, by merely percolating through great masses of\r\nporous strata during long periods, be gradually deprived of its salts\r\n_to such an extent as probably to render even sea-water\r\nfresh_.\"--_Philos. Mag_., 1856. Divesting the subject therefore of this\r\ndifficulty, other doubts would appear to suggest themselves as to the\r\napplicability of Darwin's theory to coral formations in general. For\r\ninstance, it might be supposed that rain falling on a substance already\r\nsaturated with moisture, would flow off instead of sinking into it; and\r\nthat being of less specific gravity than salt water, it would fail to\r\n\"displace an equal bulk\" of the latter. There are some extraordinary but\r\nwell attested statements of a thin layer of fresh water being found on\r\nthe surface of the sea, after heavy rains in the Bay of Bengal. (_Journ.\r\nAsiat. Soc. Beng_. vol. v. p. 239.) Besides, I fancy that in the\r\nmajority of atolls and coral islands the quantity of rain which so small\r\nan area is calculated to intercept would be insufficient of itself to\r\naccount for the extraordinary abundance of fresh water daily drawn from\r\nthe wells. For instance, the superficial extent of each of the\r\nLaccadives is but two or three square miles, the surface soil resting on\r\na crust of coral, beneath which is a stratum of sand; and yet on\r\nreaching the latter, fresh water flows in such profusion, that wells and\r\nlarge tanks for soaking coco-nut fibre are formed in any place by merely\r\n\"breaking through the crust and taking out the sand.\"--_Madras Journal_,\r\nvol. xiv. It is curious that the abundant supply of water in these wells\r\nshould have attracted the attention of the early navigators, and Cosmas\r\nIndicoplenstes, writing in the sixth century, speaks of the numerous\r\nsmall islands off the coast of Taprobane, with abundance of fresh water\r\nand coco-nut palms, although these islands rest on a bed of sand.\r\n(_Cosmas Ind_. ed. Thevenot, vol. i. p. 3, 20). It is remarkable that in\r\nthe little island of Ramisseram, one of the chain which connects Adam's\r\nBridge with the Indian continent, fresh water is found freely on sinking\r\nfor it in the sand. But this is not the case in the adjacent island of\r\nManaar, which participates in the geologic character of the interior of\r\nCeylon. The fresh water in the Laccadive wells always fluctuates with\r\nthe rise and fall of the tides. In some rare instances, as on the little\r\nisland of Bitra, which is the smallest inhabited spot in the group, the\r\nwater, though abundant, is brackish, but this is susceptible of an\r\nexplanation quite consistent with the experiments of Mr. Witt, which\r\nrequire that the process of percolation shall be continued \"during\r\n_long_ periods and through _great masses of porous strata_;\" Darwin\r\nequally concedes that to keep the rain fresh when banked in, as he\r\nassumes, by the sea, the mass of madrepore must be \"sufficiently thick\r\nto prevent mechanical admixture; and where the land consists of loose\r\nblocks of coral with open interstices, the water, if a well be dug, is\r\nbrackish.\" Conditions analogous to all these particularised, present\r\nthemselves at Jaffna, and seem to indicate that the extent to which\r\nfresh water is found there, is directly connected with percolation from\r\nthe sea. The quantity of rain which annually falls is less than in\r\nEngland, being but thirty inches; whilst the average heat is highest in\r\nCeylon, and the evaporation great in proportion. Throughout the\r\npeninsula, I am informed by Mr. Byrne, the Government surveyor of the\r\ndistrict, that as a general rule \"_all the wells are below the sea\r\nlevel_.\" It would be useless to sink them in the higher ground, where\r\nthey could only catch surface water. The November rains fill them at\r\nonce to the brim, but the water quickly subsides as the season becomes\r\ndry, and \"_sinks to the uniform level, at which it remains fixed for the\r\nnext nine or ten months_, unless when slightly affected by showers.\"\r\n\"_No well below the sea level becomes dry of itself_,\" even in seasons\r\nof extreme and continued drought. But the contents do not vary with the\r\ntides, the rise of which is so trifling that the distance from the\r\nocean, and the slowness of filtration, renders its fluctuations\r\nimperceptible.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the well of Potoor, the phenomena of which indicate\r\nits direct connection with the sea, by means of a fissure or a channel\r\nbeneath the arch of magnesian limestone, rises and falls a few inches in\r\nthe course of every twelve hours. Another well at Navokeiry, a short\r\ndistance from it, does the same, whilst the well at Tillipalli is\r\nentirely unaffected as to its level by any rains, and exhibits no\r\nalteration of its depths on either monsoon. ADMIRAL FITZROY, in his\r\n_Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of the Adventure and Beagle_, the\r\nexpedition to which Mr. Darwin was attached, adverts to the phenomenon\r\nin connection with the fresh water found in the Coral Islands, and the\r\nrise and fall of the wells, and the flow and ebb of the tide. He\r\nadvances the theory propounded by Darwin of the retention of the\r\nriver-water, which he says, \"does not mix with the salt water which\r\nsurrounds it except at the edges of the land. The flowing tide pushes on\r\nevery side, the mixed soil being very porous, and causes the water to\r\nrise: when the tide falls, the fresh water sinks also. _A sponge full of\r\nfresh water placed gently in a basin of salt water, will not part with\r\nits contents for a length of time if left untouched_, and the water in\r\nthe middle of the sponge will be found untainted by salt for many days:\r\nperhaps much longer if tried.\"--Vol. i. p. 365. In a perfectly\r\nmotionless medium the experiment of the sponge may no doubt be\r\nsuccessful to the extent mentioned by Admiral Fitzroy; and so the\r\nrain-water imbibed by a coral rock might for a length of time remain\r\nfresh where it came into no contact with the salt. But the disturbance\r\ncaused by the tides, and the partial intermixture admitted by Admiral\r\nFitzroy, must by reiterated occurrence tend in time to taint the fresh\r\nwater which is affected by the movement: and this is demonstrable even\r\nby the test of the sponge; for I find that on charging one with coloured\r\nfluid, and immersing it in a vessel containing water perfectly pure, no\r\nintermixture takes place so long as the pure water is undisturbed; but\r\non causing an artificial tide, by gradually withdrawing and as gradually\r\nreplacing a portion of the surrounding contents of the basin, the tinted\r\nwater in the sponge becomes displaced and disturbed, and in the course\r\nof a few ebbs and flows its escape is made manifest by the quantity of\r\ncolour which it imparts to the surrounding fluid.]\r\n\r\nAn idea of the general aspect of Ceylon will be formed from what has\r\nhere been described. Nearly four parts of the island are undulating\r\nplains, slightly diversified by offsets from the mountain system which\r\nentirely covers the remaining fifth. Every district, from the depths of\r\nthe valleys to the summits of the highest hills, is clothed with\r\nperennial foliage; and even the sand-drifts, to the ripple on the sea\r\nline, are carpeted with verdure, and sheltered from the sunbeams by the\r\ncool shadows of the palm groves.\r\n\r\nSOIL.--But the soil, notwithstanding this wonderful display of\r\nspontaneous vegetation, is not responsive to systematic cultivation, and\r\nis but imperfectly adapted for maturing a constant succession of seeds\r\nand cereal productions.[1] Hence arose the disappointment which beset\r\nthe earliest adventurers who opened plantations of coffee in the hills,\r\non discovering that after the first rapid development of the plants,\r\ndelicacy and languor ensued, which were only to be corrected by\r\nreturning to the earth, in the form of manures, those elements with\r\nwhich it had originally been but sparingly supplied, and which were soon\r\nexhausted by the first experiments in cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See a paper in the Journal of Agriculture, for March, 1857,\r\nEdin.: on _Tropical Cultivation and its Limits_, by Dr. MACVICAR.]\r\n\r\n_Patenas_.--The only spots hitherto found suitable for planting coffee,\r\nare those covered by the ancient forests of the mountain zone; and one\r\nof the most remarkable phenomena in the oeconomic history of the island,\r\nis the fact that the grass lands on the same hills, closely adjoining\r\nthe forests and separated from them by no visible line save the growth\r\nof the trees, although they seem to be identical in the nature of the\r\nsoil, have hitherto proved to be utterly insusceptible of reclamation or\r\nculture by the coffee planter.[1] These verdant openings, to which the\r\nnatives have given the name of _patenas_, generally occur about the\r\nmiddle elevation of the hills, the summits and the hollows being covered\r\nwith the customary growth of timber trees, which also fringe the edges\r\nof the mountain streams that trickle down these park-like openings. The\r\nforest approaches boldly to the very edge of a \"patena,\" not\r\ndisappearing gradually or sinking into a growth of underwood, but\r\nstopping abruptly and at once, the tallest trees forming a fence around\r\nthe avoided spot, as if they enclosed an area of solid stone. These\r\nsunny expanses vary in width from a few yards to many thousands of\r\nacres; in the lower ranges of the hills they are covered with tall\r\nlemon-grass _(Andropogon schoenanthus)_ of which the oppressive perfume\r\nand coarse texture, when full grown, render it distasteful to cattle,\r\nwhich will only crop the delicate braird that springs after the surface\r\nhas been annually burnt by the Kandyans. Two stunted trees, alone, are\r\nseen to thrive in these extraordinary prairies, _Careya arborea_ and\r\n_Emblica officinalis_, and these only below an altitude of 4000 feet;\r\nabove this, the lemon-grass is superseded by harder and more wiry\r\nspecies; but the earth is still the same, a mixture of decomposed quartz\r\nlargely impregnated with oxide of iron, but wanting the phosphates and\r\nother salts which are essential to highly organised vegetation.[2] The\r\nextent of the patena land is enormous in Ceylon, amounting to millions\r\nof acres; and it is to be hoped that the complaints which have hitherto\r\nbeen made by the experimental cultivators of coffee in the Kandyan\r\nprovinces may hereafter prove exaggerated, and that much that has been\r\nattributed to the poverty of the soil may eventually be traced to\r\ndeficiency of skill on the part of the early planters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Since the above was written, attempts have been made,\r\nchiefly by natives to plant coffee on patena land. The result is a\r\nconviction that the cultivation is practicable, by the use of manures\r\nfrom the beginning; whereas forest land is capable, for three or four\r\nyears at least, of yielding coffee without any artificial enrichment of\r\nthe soil.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: HUMBOLDT is disposed to ascribe the absence of trees in the\r\nvast grassy plains of South America, to \"the destructive custom of\r\nsetting fire to the woods, when the natives want to convert the soil\r\ninto pasture: when during the lapse of centuries grasses and plants have\r\ncovered the surface with a carpet, the seeds of trees can no longer\r\ngerminate and fix themselves in the earth, although birds and winds\r\ncarry them continually from the distant forests into the\r\nSavannahs.\"--_Narrative_, vol. i. ch. vi. p. 242.]\r\n\r\nThe natives in the same lofty localities find no deficient returns in\r\nthe crops of rice, which they raise in the ravines and hollows, into\r\nwhich the earth from above has been washed by the periodical rains; but\r\nthe cultivation of rice is so entirely dependent on the presence of\r\nwater, that no inference can be fairly drawn as to the quality of the\r\nsoil from the abundance of its harvest.\r\n\r\nThe fields on which rice is grown in these mountains form one of the\r\nmost picturesque and beautiful objects in the country of the Kandyans.\r\nSelecting an angular recess where two hills converge, they construct a\r\nseries of terraces, raised stage above stage, and retiring as they\r\nascend along the slope of the acclivity, up which they are carried as\r\nhigh as the soil extends.[1] Each terrace is furnished with a low ledge\r\nin front, behind which the requisite depth of water is retained during\r\nthe germination of the seed, and what is superfluous is permitted to\r\ntrickle down to the one below it. In order to carry on this peculiar\r\ncultivation the streams are led along the level of the hills, often from\r\na distance of many miles, with a skill and perseverance for which the\r\nnatives of these mountains have attained a great renown.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The conversion of the land into these hanging farms is\r\nknown in Ceylon as \"assuedamizing,\" a term borrowed from the Kandyan\r\nvernacular, in which the word \"assuedamé\" implies the process above\r\ndescribed.]\r\n\r\nIn the lowlands to the south, the soil partakes of the character of the\r\nhills from whose detritus it is to a great extent formed. In it rice is\r\nthe chief article produced, and for its cultivation the disintegrated\r\nlaterite (_cabook_), when thoroughly irrigated, is sufficiently adapted.\r\nThe seed time in the southern section of the island is dependent on the\r\narrival of the rains in November and May, and hence the mountains and\r\nthe maritime districts at their base enjoy two harvests in each\r\nyear--the _Maha_, which is sown about July and August, and reaped in\r\nDecember and January, the _Yalla_ which is sown in spring, and reaped\r\nfrom the 15th of July to the 20th September. But owing to the different\r\ndescription of seed sown in particular localites, and the extent to\r\nwhich they are respectively affected by the rains, the times of sowing\r\nand harvest vary considerably on different sides of the island.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The reaping of other descriptions of grain besides rice\r\noccurs at various periods of the year according to the locality.]\r\n\r\nIn the north, where the influence of the monsoons is felt with less\r\nforce and regularity, and where, to counteract their uncertainty, the\r\nrain is collected in reservoirs, a wider discretion is left to the\r\nhusbandman in the choice of season for his operations.[1] Two crops of\r\ngrain, however, are the utmost that is taken from the land, and in many\r\ninstances only one. The soil near the coast is light and sandy, but in\r\nthe great central districts of Neuera-kalawa and the Wanny, there is\r\nfound in the midst of the forests a dark vegetable mould, in which in\r\nformer times rice was abundantly grown by the aid of those prodigious\r\nartificial works for irrigation which still form one of the wonders of\r\nthe island. Many of the tanks, though partially in ruins, cover an area\r\nfrom ten to fifteen miles in circumference. They are now generally\r\nbroken and decayed; the waters which would fertilise a province are\r\nallowed to waste themselves in the sands, and hundreds of square miles\r\ncapable of furnishing food for all the inhabitants of Ceylon are\r\nabandoned to solitude and malaria, whilst rice for the support of the\r\nnon-agricultural population is annually imported from the opposite coast\r\nof India.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This peculiarity of the north of Ceylon was noticed by the\r\nChinese traveller FA HIAN, who visited the island in the fourth century,\r\nand says of the country around Anarajapoora: \"L'ensemencement des champs\r\nest suivant la volonté des gens; il n'y a point de temps pour\r\ncela.\"--_Fo[)e] Kou[)e] Ki_; p. 332.]\r\n\r\n_Talawas_.--In these districts of the lowlands, especially on the\r\neastern coast of the island, and in the country watered by the\r\nMahawelli-ganga and the other great rivers which flow towards the Bay of\r\nBengal and the magnificent estuary of Trincomalie, there are open glades\r\nwhich diversify the forest scenery somewhat resembling the grassy\r\npatenas in the hills, but differing from them in the character of their\r\nsoil and vegetation. These park-like meadows, or, as the natives call\r\nthem, \"talawas,\" vary in extent from one to a thousand acres. They are\r\nbelted by the surrounding woods, and studded with groups of timber and\r\nsometimes with single trees of majestic dimensions. Through these\r\npastures the deer troop in herds within gunshot, bounding into the\r\nnearest cover when disturbed.\r\n\r\nLower still and immediately adjoining the sea-coast, the broken forest\r\ngives place to brushwood, with here and there an assemblage of dwarf\r\nshrubs; but as far as the eye can reach, there is one vast level of\r\nimpenetrable jungle, broken only by the long sweep of salt marshes which\r\nform lakes in the rainy season, but are dry between the monsoons, and\r\ncrusted with crystals that glitter like snow in the sunshine.\r\n\r\nOn the western side of the island the rivers have formed broad alluvial\r\nplains, in which the Dutch attempted to grow sugar. The experiment has\r\nbeen often resumed since; but even here the soil is so defective, that\r\nthe cost of artificially enriching it has hitherto been a serious\r\nobstruction to success commercially, although in one or two instances,\r\nplantations on a small scale have succeeded to a certain extent.\r\n\r\nMETALS.--The plutonic rocks of Ceylon are but slightly metalliferous,\r\nand hitherto their veins and deposits have been but imperfectly\r\nexamined. The first successful survey attempted by the Government was\r\nundertaken during the administration of Viscount Torrington, who, in\r\n1847, commissioned Dr. Gygax to proceed to the hill district south of\r\nAdam's Peak, and furnish a report on its products. His investigations\r\nextended from Ratnapoora, in a south-eastward direction, to the\r\nmountains which overhang Bintenne, but the results obtained did not\r\ngreatly enlarge the knowledge previously possessed. He established the\r\nexistence of _tin_ in the alluvium along the base of the mountains to\r\nthe eastward towards Edelgashena; but so circumstanced, owing to the\r\nflow of the Walleway river, that, without lowering its level, the metal\r\ncould not be extracted with advantage. The position in which it occurs\r\nis similar to that in which tin ore presents itself in Saxony; and along\r\nwith it, the natives, when searching for gems, discover garnets,\r\ncorundum, white topazes, zircon, and tourmaline.\r\n\r\n_Gold_ is found in minute particles at Gettyhedra, and in the beds of\r\nthe Maha Oya and other rivers flowing towards the west.[1] But the\r\nquantity hitherto discovered has been too trivial to reward the search.\r\nThe early inhabitants of the island were not ignorant of its presence;\r\nbut its occurrence on a memorable occasion, as well as that of silver\r\nand copper, is recorded in the Mahawanso as a miraculous manifestation,\r\nwhich signalised the founding of one of the most renowned shrines at the\r\nancient capital.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Ruanwellé, a fort about forty miles distant from Colombo,\r\nderives its name from the sands of the river which flows below\r\nit,--rang-welle, \"golden sand.\" \"Rang-galla,\" in the central province,\r\nis referable to the same root--the rock of gold.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso,_ ch. xxiii. p. 166, 167.]\r\n\r\n_Nickel_ and _cobalt_ appear in small quantities in Saffragam, and the\r\nlatter, together with _rutile_ (an oxide of titanium) and _wolfram_,\r\nmight find a market in China for the colouring of porcelain.[1]\r\n_Tellurium_, another rare and valuable metal, hitherto found only in\r\nTransylvania and the Ural, has likewise been discovered in these\r\nmountains, _Manganese_ is abundant, and _Iron_ occurs in the form of\r\nmagnetic iron ore, titanite, chromate, yellow hydrated, per-oxide and\r\niron pyrites. In most of these, however, the metal is scanty, and the\r\nores of little comparative value, except for the extraction of manganese\r\nand chrome. \"But there is another description of iron ore,\" says Dr.\r\nGygax, in his official report to the Ceylon Government, \"which is found\r\nin vast abundance, brown and compact, generally in the state of\r\ncarbonate, though still blended with a little chrome, and often\r\nmolybdena. It occurs in large masses and veins, one of which extends for\r\na distance of fifteen miles; from it millions of tons might be smelted,\r\nand when found adjacent to fuel and water-carriage, it might be worked\r\nto a profit. The quality of the iron ore found in Ceylon is singularly\r\nfine; it is easily smelted, and so pure when reduced as to resemble\r\nsilver. The rough ore produces from _thirty_ to _seventy-five_ per\r\ncent., and on an average fully _fifty_. The iron wrought from it\r\nrequires no puddling, and, converted into steel, it cuts like a diamond.\r\nThe metal could be laid down in Colombo at £6 per ton, even supposing\r\nthe ore to be brought thither for smelting, and prepared with English\r\ncoal; but _anthracite_ being found upon the spot, it could be used in\r\nthe proportion of three to one of the British coal; and the cost\r\ncorrespondingly reduced.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The _Asiatic Annual Register_ for 1799 contains the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n\"_Extract from a letter from Colombo, dated 26th Oct. 1798_.\r\n\r\n\"A discovery has been lately made here of a very rich mine of\r\n_quicksilver,_ about six miles from this place. The appearances are very\r\npromising, for a handful of the earth on the surface will, by being\r\nwashed, produce the value of a rupee. A guard is set over it, and\r\naccounts sent express to the Madras Government.\"--P. 53. See also\r\nPERCIVAL'S _Ceylon_, p. 539.\r\n\r\nJOINVILLE, in a MS, essay on _The Geology of Ceylon_, now in the library\r\nof the East India Company, says that near Trincomalie there is \"un sable\r\nnoir, composé de détriments de trappe et de cristaux de fer, _dans\r\nlequel on trouve par le lavage beaucoup de mercure_.\"]\r\n\r\nRemains of ancient furnaces are met with in all directions precisely\r\nsimilar to those still in use amongst the natives. The Singhalese obtain\r\nthe ore they require without the trouble of mining; seeking a spot where\r\nthe soil has been loosened by the latest rains, they break off a\r\nsufficient quantity, which, in less than three hours, they convert into\r\niron by the simplest possible means. None of their furnaces are capable\r\nof smelting more than twenty pounds of ore, and yet this quantity yields\r\nfrom seven to ten pounds of good metal.\r\n\r\nThe _anthracite_ alluded to by Dr. Gygax is found in the southern range\r\nof hills near Nambepane, in close proximity to rich veins of _plumbago_,\r\nwhich are largely worked in the same district, and the quantity of the\r\nlatter annually exported from Ceylon exceeds a thousand tons.\r\n_Molybdena_ is found in profusion dispersed through many rocks in\r\nSaffragam, and it occurs in the alluvium in grey scales, so nearly\r\nresembling plumbago as to be commonly mistaken for it. _Kaolin_, called\r\nby the natives _Kirimattie_, appears at Neuera-ellia at Hewahette,\r\nKaduganawa, and in many of the higher ranges as well as in the low\r\ncountry near Colombo; its colour is so clear as to suit for the\r\nmanufacture of porcelain[1]; but the difficulty and cost of carriage\r\nrender it as yet unavailing for commerce, and the only use to which it\r\nhas hitherto been applied is to serve for whitewash instead of lime.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The kaolin of Ceylon, according to an analysis in 1847,\r\nconsists of--\r\n\r\n  Pure kaolin               70.0\r\n  Silica                    26.0\r\n  Molybdena and iron oxide   4.0\r\n                            ____\r\n                           100.0\r\n\r\nIn the _Ming-she_, or history of the Ming dynasty, A.D. 1368-1643, by\r\nChan-ting-yuh, \"pottery-stone\" is; enumerated among the imports into\r\nChina from Ceylon.--B. cccxxvi. p. 5.]\r\n\r\n_Nitre_ has long been known to exist in Ceylon, where the localities in\r\nwhich it occurs are similar to those in Brazil. In Saffragam alone there\r\nare upwards of sixty caverns known to the natives, from which it may be\r\nextracted, and others exist in various parts of the island, where the\r\nabundance of wood to assist in its lixiviation would render that process\r\neasy and profitable. Yet so sparingly has this been hitherto attempted,\r\nthat even for purposes of refrigeration, crude saltpetre is still\r\nimported from India.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The mineralogy of Ceylon has hitherto undergone no\r\nscientific scrutiny, nor have its mineral productions been arranged in\r\nany systematic and comprehensive catalogue. Specimens are to be found in\r\nabundance in the hands of native dealers; but from indifference or\r\ncaution they express their inability to afford adequate information as\r\nto their locality, their geological position, or even to show with\r\nsufficient certainty that they belong to the island. Dr. Gygax, as the\r\nresults of some years spent in exploring different districts previous to\r\n1847, was enabled to furnish a list of but thirty-seven species, the\r\nsite of which he had determined by personal inspection.

The ancients celebrated the gems as well as the pearls of\r\n\"Taprobane;\" the tales of mariners returning from their eastern\r\nexpeditions supplied to the story-tellers of the Arabian Nights their\r\nfables of the jewels of \"Serendib;\" and the travellers of the Middle\r\nAges, on returning to Europe, told of the \"sapphires, topazes,\r\namethysts, garnets, and other costly stones\" of Ceylon, and of the ruby\r\nwhich belonged to the king of the island, \"a span in length, without a\r\nflaw, and brilliant beyond description.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Travels of_ MARCO POLO, _a Venetian, in the Thirteenth\r\nCentury_, Lond. 1818.]\r\n\r\nThe extent to which gems are still found is sufficient to account for\r\nthe early traditions of their splendour and profusion; and fabulous as\r\nthis story of the ruby of the Kandyan kings may be, the abundance of\r\ngems in Saffragam has given to the capital of the district the name of\r\n_Ratnapoora_, which means literally \"the city of rubies.\"[1] They are\r\nnot, however, confined to this quarter alone, but quantities are still\r\nfound on the western plains between Adam's Peak and the sea, at\r\nNeuera-ellia, in Oovah, at Kandy, at Mattelle in the central province,\r\nand at Ruanwelli near Colombo, at Matura, and in the beds of the rivers\r\neastwards towards the ancient Mahagam.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the vicinity of Ratnapoora there are to be obtained\r\nmasses of quartz of the most delicate rose colour. Some pieces, which\r\nwere brought to me in Colombo, were of extraordinary beauty; and I have\r\nreason to believe that it can be obtained in pieces large enough to be\r\nused as slabs for tables, or formed into vases and columns, I may\r\nobserve that similar pieces are to be found in the south of Ireland,\r\nnear Cork.]\r\n\r\nBut the localities which chiefly supply the Ceylon gems are the alluvial\r\nplains at the foot of the stupendous hills of Saffragam, in which the\r\ndetritus of the rocks has been carried down and intercepted by the\r\nslight elevations that rise at some distance from the base of the\r\nmountains. The most remarkable of these gem-bearing deposits is in the\r\nflat country around Ballangodde, south-east of Ratnapoora; but almost\r\nevery valley in communication with the rocks of the higher ranges\r\ncontains stones of more or less value, and the beds of the rivers\r\nflowing southward from the mountain chain are so rich in comminuted\r\nfragments of rubies, sapphires, and garnets[1], that their sands in some\r\nplaces are used by lapidaries in polishing the softer stones, and in\r\nsawing the elephants' grinders into plates. The cook of a government\r\nofficer at Galle recently brought to him a ruby about the size of a\r\nsmall pea, which he had taken from the crop of a fowl.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. BAKER, in a work entitled _The Rifle and the Hound in\r\nCeylon_, thus describes the sands of the Manic Ganga, near the ruins of\r\nMahagam, in the south-eastern extremity of the island:--\"The sand was\r\ncomposed of mica, quartz, sapphire, ruby, and jacinth; but the large\r\nproportion of ruby sand was so extraordinary that it seemed to rival\r\nSinbad's story of the vale of gems. The whole of this was valueless, but\r\nthe appearance of the sand was very inviting, as the shallow stream in\r\nrippling over it magnified the tiny gems into stones of some magnitude.\r\nI passed an hour in vainly searching for a ruby worth collecting, but\r\nthe largest did not exceed the size of a mustard seed.\"--BAKER'S _Rifle\r\nand Hound in Ceylon_, p. 181.]\r\n\r\nOf late years considerable energy has been shown by those engaged in the\r\nsearch for gems; neglected districts have been explored, and new fields\r\nhave been opened up at such places as Karangodde and Weraloopa, whence\r\nstones have been taken of unusual size and value.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, in the recent strata of gravel, nor in those now in\r\nprocess of formation, that the natives search for gems. They penetrate\r\nthese to the depth of from ten to twenty feet, in order to reach a lower\r\ndeposit distinguished by the name of _Nellan_, in which the objects of\r\ntheir search are found. This is of so early a formation that it\r\nunderlies the present beds of rivers, and is generally separated from\r\nthem or from the superincumbent gravel by a hard crust (called _Kadua_),\r\na few inches in thickness, and so consolidated as to have somewhat the\r\nappearance of laterite, or of sun-burnt brick. The nellan is for the\r\nmost part horizontal, but occasionally it is raised into an incline as\r\nit approaches the base of the hills. It appears to have been deposited\r\nprevious to the eruption of the basalt, on which in some places it\r\nreclines, and to have undergone some alteration from the contact. It\r\nconsists of water-worn pebbles firmly imbedded in clay, and occasionally\r\nthere occur large lumps of granite and gneiss, in the hollows under\r\nwhich, as well as in \"pockets\" in the clay (which from their shape the\r\nnatives denominate \"elephants' footsteps\") gems are frequently found in\r\ngroups as if washed in by the current.\r\n\r\nThe persons who devote themselves to this uncertain pursuit are chiefly\r\nSinghalese, and the season selected by them for \"gemming\" is between\r\nDecember and March, when the waters are low.[1] The poorer and least\r\nenterprising adventurers betake themselves to the beds of streams, but\r\nthe most certain though the most costly course is to sink pits in the\r\nadjacent plains, which are consequently indented with such traces of\r\nrecent explorers. The upper gravel is pierced, the covering crust is\r\nreached and broken through, and the nellan being shovelled into conical\r\nbaskets and washed to free it from the sand, the residue is carefully\r\nsearched for whatever rounded crystals and minute gems it may contain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A very interesting account of _Gems and Gem Searching_, by\r\nMr. WM. STEWART, appeared in the _Colombo Observer_ for June, 1855.]\r\n\r\nIt is strongly characteristic of the want of energy in the Singhalese,\r\nthat although for centuries those alluvial plains and watercourses have\r\nbeen searched without ceasing, no attempt appears to have been made to\r\nexplore the rocks themselves, in the debris of which the gems have been\r\nbrought down by the rivers. Dr. Gygax says: \"I found at Hima Pohura, on\r\nthe south-eastern decline of the Pettigalle-Kanda, about the middle of\r\nthe descent, a stratum of grey granite containing, with iron pyrites and\r\nmolybdena, innumerable rubies from one-tenth to a fourth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, and of a fine rose colour, but split and falling to powder. It\r\nis not an isolated bed of minerals, but a regular stratum extending\r\nprobably to the same depth and distance as the other granite formations.\r\nI followed it as far as was practicable for close examination, but\r\neverywhere in the lower part of the valley I found it so decomposed that\r\nthe hammer sunk in the rock, and even bamboos were growing on it. On the\r\nhigher ground near some small round hills which intercept it, I found\r\nthe rubies changed into brown corundum. Upon the hills themselves the\r\ntrace was lost, and instead of a stratum there was merely a wild chaos\r\nof blocks of yellow granite. I carefully examined all the minerals which\r\nthis stratum contains,--felspar, mica, and quartz molybdena, and iron\r\npyrites,--and I found all similar to those I had previously got adhering\r\nto rough rubies offered for sale at Colombo. _I firmly believe that in\r\nsuch strata the rubies of Ceylon are originally found_, and that those\r\nin the white and blue clay at Ballangodde and Ratnapoora are but\r\nsecondary deposits. I am further inclined to believe that these extend\r\nover the whole island, although often intercepted and changed in their\r\ndirection by the rising of the yellow granite.\" It is highly probable\r\nthat the finest rubies are to be found in them, perfect and unchanged by\r\ndecomposition; and that they are to be obtained by opening a regular\r\nmine in the rock like the ruby mine of Badakshan in Bactria described by\r\nSir Alexander Burnes. Dr. Gygax adds that having often received the\r\nminerals of this stratum with the crystals perfect, he has reason to\r\nbelieve that places are known to the natives where such mines might be\r\nopened with confidence of success.\r\n\r\nRubies both crystalline and amorphous are also found in a particular\r\nstratum of dolomite at Bullatotte and Badulla, in which there is a\r\npeculiar copper-coloured mica with metallic lustre. _Star rubies_, the\r\n\"asteria\" of Pliny (so called from their containing a movable six-rayed\r\nstar), are to be had at Ratnapoora and for very trifling sums. The blue\r\ntinge which detracts from the value of the pure ruby, whose colour\r\nshould resemble \"pigeon's blood,\" is removed by the Singhalese, by\r\nenveloping the stone in the lime of a calcined shell and exposing it to\r\na high heat. _Spinel_ of extremely beautiful colours is found in the bed\r\nof the Mahawelli-ganga at Kandy, and from the locality it has obtained\r\nthe name of _Candite_.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that although the _sapphire_ is found in all this region\r\nin greater quantity than the ruby, it has never yet been discovered in\r\nthe original matrix, and the small fragments which sometimes occur in\r\ndolomite show that there it is but a deposit. From its exquisite colour\r\nand the size in which it is commonly found, it forms by far the most\r\nvaluable gem of the island. A piece which was dug out of the alluvium\r\nwithin a few miles of Ratnapoora in 1853, was purchased by a Moor at\r\nColombo, in whose hands it was valued at upwards of four thousand\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nThe original site of the _oriental topaz_ is equally unknown with that\r\nof the sapphire. The Singhalese rightly believe them to be the same\r\nstone only differing in colour, and crystals are said to be obtained\r\nwith one portion yellow and the other blue.\r\n\r\n_Garnets_ of inferior quality are common in the gneiss, but finer ones\r\nare found in the hornblende rocks.\r\n\r\n_Cinnamon-stone_ (which is properly a variety of garnet) is so extremely\r\nabundant, that vast rocks containing it in profusion exist in many\r\nplaces, especially in the alluvium around Matura; and at Belligam, a few\r\nmiles east from Point-de-Galle, a vast detached rock is so largely\r\ncomposed of cinnamon-stones that it is carried off in lumps for the\r\npurpose of extracting and polishing them.\r\n\r\nThe _Cat's-eye_ is one of the jewels of which the Singhalese are\r\nespecially proud, from a belief that it is only found in their island;\r\nbut in this I apprehend they are misinformed, as specimens of equal\r\nmerit have been brought from Quilon and Cochin on the southern coast of\r\nHindostan. The cat's-eye is a greenish translucent quartz, and when cut\r\n_en cabochon_ it presents a moving internal reflection which is ascribed\r\nto the presence of filaments of asbestos. Its perfection is estimated by\r\nthe natives in proportion to the narrowness and sharpness of the ray and\r\nthe pure olive-tint of the ground over which it plays.\r\n\r\n_Amethysts_ are found in the gneiss, and some discoloured though\r\nbeautiful specimens in syenite; they are too common to be highly\r\nesteemed. The \"Matura Diamonds,\" which are largely used by the native\r\njewellers, consist of zircon, found in the syenite not only uncoloured,\r\nbut also of pink and yellow tints, the former passing for rubies.\r\n\r\nBut one of the prettiest though commonest gems in the island is the\r\n\"Moon-stone,\" a variety of pearly adularia presenting chatoyant rays\r\nwhen simply polished. They are so abundant that the finest specimens may\r\nbe bought for a few shillings. These, with _aqua marina_, a bad\r\ndescription of _opal rock crystal_ in extremely large pieces,\r\n_tourmaline_, and a number of others of no great value, compose the list\r\nof native gems procurable in Ceylon.[1] Diamonds, emeralds, agates,\r\ncarnelians, opal and turquoise, when they are exhibited by the natives,\r\nhave all been imported from India.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Caswini and some of the Arabian geographers assert that the\r\ndiamond is found at Adam's Peak; but this is improbable, as there is no\r\nformation resembling the _cascalhao_ of Brazil or the diamond\r\nconglomerate of Golconda. If diamonds were offered for sale in Ceylon,\r\nin the time of the Arab navigators, they must have been brought thither\r\nfrom India, (_Journ. As. Soc. Beng._ xiii. 633.)]\r\n\r\nDuring the dynasty of the Kandyan sovereigns, the right of digging for\r\ngems was a royalty reserved jealously for the King; and the inhabitants\r\nof particular villages were employed in their search under the\r\nsuperintendence of hereditary officers, with the rank of \"Mudianse.\" By\r\nthe British Government the monopoly was early abolished as a source of\r\nrevenue, and no license is now required by the jewel-hunters.\r\n\r\nGreat numbers of persons of the worst-regulated habits are constantly\r\nengaged in this exciting and precarious trade; and serious\r\ndemoralisation is engendered amongst the villagers by the idle and\r\ndissolute adventurers who resort to Saffragam. Systematic industry\r\nsuffers, and the cultivation of the land is frequently neglected whilst\r\nits owners are absorbed in these speculative and tantalising\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\nThe products of their searches are disposed of to the Moors, who resort\r\nto Saffragam from the low country, carrying up cloth and salt, to be\r\nexchanged for gems and coffee. At the annual Buddhist festival of the\r\nPera-hara, a jewel-fair is held at Ratnapoora, to which the purchasers\r\nresort from all parts of Ceylon. Of late years, however, the condition\r\nof the people in Saffragam has so much improved that it has become\r\ndifficult to obtain the finest jewels, the wealthier natives preferring\r\nto retain them as investments: they part with them reluctantly, and only\r\nfor gold, which they find equally convenient for concealment.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: So eager is the appetite for hoarding in these hills, that\r\neleven rupees (equal to twenty-two shillings) have frequently been given\r\nfor a sovereign.]\r\n\r\nThe lapidaries who cut and polish the stones are chiefly Moors, but\r\ntheir tools are so primitive, and their skill so deficient, that a gem\r\ngenerally loses in value by having passed through their hands. The\r\ninferior kinds, such as cinnamon-stones, garnets, and tourmaline, are\r\npolished by ordinary artists at Kandy, Matura, and Galle; but the more\r\nexpert lapidaries, who cut rubies and sapphires, reside chiefly at\r\nCaltura and Colombo.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, the rarer gems are less costly in Europe than in\r\nColombo. In London and Paris the quantities brought from all parts of\r\nthe world are sufficient to establish something like a market value;\r\nbut, in Ceylon, the supply is so uncertain that the price is always\r\nregulated at the moment by the rank and wealth of the purchaser. Strange\r\nto say, too, there is often an unwillingness even amongst the Moorish\r\ndealers to sell the rarest and finest specimens; those who are wealthy\r\nbeing anxious to retain them, and few but stones of secondary value are\r\noffered for sale. Besides, the Rajahs and native Princes of India,\r\namongst whom the passion for jewels is universal, are known to give such\r\nextravagant prices that the best are always sent to them from Ceylon.\r\n\r\nFrom the Custom House returns it is impossible to form any calculation\r\nas to the value of the precious stones exported from the island. A\r\nportion only appears, even of those sent to England, the remainder being\r\ncarried away by private parties. Of the total number found, one-fourth\r\nis probably purchased by the natives themselves, more than one-half is\r\nsent to the Continent of India, and the remainder represents the export\r\nto Europe. Computed in this way, the quantity of precious stones found\r\nin the island may be estimated at 10,000_l_. per annum.\r\n\r\nRIVERS.--From the mountainous configuration of the country and the\r\nabundance of the rains, the rivers are large and numerous in the south\r\nof the island--ten of considerable magnitude flowing into the sea on the\r\nwest coast, between Point-de-Galle and Manaar, and a still greater\r\nnumber, though inferior in volume, on the east. In the low country,\r\nwhere the heat is intense and evaporation proportionate, they derive\r\nlittle of their supply from springs; and the passing showers which fall\r\nscarcely more than replace the moisture drawn by the sun from the\r\nparched and thirsty soil.\r\n\r\nHence in the plains there are comparatively few rivulets or running\r\nstreams; the rivers there flow in almost solitary lines to the sea; and\r\nthe beds of their minor affluents serve only to conduct to them the\r\ntorrents which descend at the change of each monsoon, their channels at\r\nother times being exhausted and dry. But in their course through the\r\nhills, and the broken ground at their base, they are supplied by\r\nnumerous feeders, which convey to them the frequent showers that fall in\r\nhigh altitudes. Hence their tracks are through some of the noblest\r\nscenery in the world; rushing through ravines and glens, and falling\r\nover precipitous rocks in the depths of wooded valleys, they exhibit a\r\nsuccession of rapids, cataracts, and torrents, unsurpassed in\r\nmagnificence and beauty. On reaching the plains, the boldness of their\r\nmarch and the graceful outline of their sweep are indicative of the\r\nlittle obstruction opposed by the sandy and porous soil through which\r\nthey flow. Throughout their entire course dense forests shade their\r\nbanks, and, as they approach the sea, tamarisks and over-arching\r\nmangroves mark where their waters mingle with the tide.\r\n\r\nOf all the Ceylon rivers, the most important by far is the\r\nMahawelli-ganga--the Ganges of Ptolemy--which, rising in the south near\r\nAdam's Peak, traverses more than one-third of the mountain zone[1],\r\ndrains upwards of four thousand square miles, and flows into the sea by\r\na number of branches, near the noble harbour of Trincomalie. The\r\nfollowing table gives a comparative view of the magnitude of the rivers\r\nthat rise in the hills, and of the extent of the low country traversed\r\nby each of them:--\r\n\r\n                                    Square Miles Square Miles   Length of\r\n                  Embouchure.       drained in   drained in the Course of\r\n                                    Mountain     low Country,   the main\r\n                                    Zone.        about          Stream.\r\n\r\nMahawelii-ganga  near Trincomalie      1782          2300          134\r\nKirinde          at Mahagan              34           300           62\r\nWellawey         near Hambangtotte      263           500           69\r\nNeivalle         at Matura               64           200           42\r\n(Three Rivers)   near Tangalle           56           200\r\nGindura          near Galle             180           200           59\r\nKalu-oya         at Caltura             841           300           72\r\nKalany           Colombo                692           200           84\r\nThe Kaymel or\r\n  Mahaoya        near Negombo           253           200           68\r\nDederoo-oya      near Chilaw             38           700           70\r\n                                   ----------------------------\r\n                                       4212          5100\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See _ante_, p. 12, for a definition of what constitutes the\r\n\"mountain zone\" of Ceylon.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, there are a number of large rivers which belong\r\nentirely to the plains in the northern and south-eastern portions of the\r\nisland, the principal of which are the Arive and the Moderegam, which\r\nflow into the Gulf of Manaar; the Kala-oya and the Kanda-lady, which\r\nempty themselves into the Bay of Calpentyn; the Maniek or Kattragam, and\r\nthe Koombookgam, opposite to the Little Bass rocks and the Naveloor, the\r\nChadawak, and Arookgam, south of Batticaloa. The extent of country\r\ndrained by these latter streams is little short of thirteen thousand\r\nsquare miles.\r\n\r\nVery few of the rivers of Ceylon are navigable, and these only by canoes\r\nand flat-bottomed paddy boats, which ascend some of the largest for\r\nshort distances, till impeded by the rapids, occasioned by rocks in the\r\nlowest range of the hills. In this way the Niwalle at Matura can be\r\nascended for about fifteen miles, as far as Wellehara; the Kalu-ganga\r\ncan be traversed from Caltura to Ratnapoora; the Bentotte river for\r\nsixteen miles to Pittagalla; and the Kalany from Colombo to the foot of\r\nthe mountains near Ambogammoa. The Mahawelli-ganga is navigable from\r\nTrincomalie to within a short distance of Kanda[1]; and many of the\r\nlesser streams, the Kirinde and Wellawey in the south, and the Kaymel,\r\nthe Dedroo-oya, and the Aripo river on the west of the island, are used\r\nfor short distances by boats.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For an account of the capabilities of the Mahawelli-ganga,\r\nas regards navigation, see BROOKE'S _Report, Roy. Geog. Journ._ vol.\r\niii. p. 223. and _post_, Vol. II. p. 423.]\r\n\r\nAll these streams are liable, during the fury of the monsoons, to be\r\nsurcharged with rain till they overflow their banks, and spread in wide\r\ninundations over the level country. On the subsidence of these waters,\r\nthe intense heat of the sun acting on the surface they leave deserted,\r\nproduces a noxious and fatal malaria. Hence the rivers of Ceylon present\r\nthe curious anomaly, that whilst the tanks and reservoirs of the\r\ninterior diffuse a healthful coolness around, the running water of the\r\nrivers is prolific of fevers; and in some seasons so deadly is the\r\npestilence that the Malabar coolies, as well as the native peasantry,\r\nbetake themselves to precipitate flight.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It has been remarked along the Mahawelli-ganga, a few miles\r\nfrom Kandy, that during the deadly season, after the subsidence of the\r\nrains, the jungle fever generally attacks one face of the hills through\r\nwhich it winds, leading the opposite side entirely exempted, as if the\r\npoisonous vapour, being carried by the current of air, affected only\r\nthose aspects against which it directly impinged.]\r\n\r\nFew of the larger rivers have been bridged, except those which intersect\r\nthe great high roads from Point-de-Galle to Colombo, and thence to\r\nKandy. Near the sea this has been effected by timber platforms,\r\nsustained by piles sufficiently strong to withstand the force of the\r\nfloods at the change of each monsoon. A bridge of boats connects each\r\nside of the Kalany, and on reaching the Mahawelli-ganga at Peradenia,\r\none of the most picturesque structures on the island is a noble bridge\r\nof a single arch, 205 feet in span, chiefly constructed of satin-wood,\r\nand thrown across the river by General Fraser in 1832.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the margin of the sea, an appearance is presented by the\r\noutline of the coast, near the embouchures of the principal rivers,\r\nwhich is very remarkable. It is common to both sides of the island,\r\nthough it has attained its greatest development on the east. In order to\r\ncomprehend its formation, it is necessary to observe that Ceylon lies in\r\nthe course of the ocean currents in the Bay of Bengal, which run north\r\nor south according to the prevalence of the monsoon, and with greater or\r\nless velocity in proportion to its force at particular periods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURRENT IN THE NE MONSOON.]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning and during the strength of the northeast monsoon the\r\ncurrent sets strongly along the coast of Coromandel to the southward, a\r\nportion of it frequently entering Palks Bay to the north of Ceylon; but\r\nthe main stream keeping invariably to the east of the island, runs with\r\na velocity of from one and a half to two miles an hour, and after\r\npassing the Great Bass, it keeps its course seaward. At other times,\r\nafter the monsoon has spent its violence, the current is weak, and\r\nfollows the line of the land to the westward as far as Point-de-Galle,\r\nor even to Colombo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURRENT IN THE S.W. MONSOON]\r\n\r\nIn the south-west monsoon the current changes its direction; and,\r\nalthough it flows steadily to the northward, its action is very\r\nirregular and unequal till it readies the Coromandel coast, after\r\npassing Ceylon. This is accounted for by the obstruction opposed by the\r\nheadlands of Ceylon, which so intercept the stream that the current,\r\nwhich might otherwise set into the Gulf of Manaar, takes a\r\nsouth-easterly direction by Galle and Donedra Head.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For an account of the currents of Ceylon, see HORSBURGH's\r\n_Directions for Sailing to and from the East Indies, &c._; vol i. p.\r\n516, 536, 580; KEITH JOHNSTON's _Physical Atlas_, plate xiii. p. 50.]\r\n\r\nThere being no lakes in Ceylon[1], in the still waters of which the\r\nrivers might clear themselves of the earthy matter swept along in their\r\nrapid course from the hills, they arrive at the beach laden with sand\r\nand alluvium, and at their junction with the ocean being met\r\ntransversely by the gulf-streams, the sand and soil with which they are\r\nladen, instead of being carried out to sea, are heaped up in bars along\r\nthe shores, and these, being augmented by similar deposits held in\r\nsuspension by the currents, soon extend to north, and south, and force\r\nthe rivers to flow behind them in search of a new outlet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pliny alludes to a lake in Ceylon of vast dimensions, but\r\nit is clear that his informants must have spoken of one of the huge\r\ntanks for the purpose of irrigation. Some of the _Mappe-mondes_ of the\r\nMiddle Ages place a lake in the middle of the island, with a city\r\ninhabited by astrologers; but they have merely reproduced the error of\r\nearlier geographers. (SANTAREM, _Cosmog_. tom. iii. p. 336.)]\r\n\r\nThese formations once commenced, their growth proceeds with rapidity,\r\nmore especially on the east side of the island; as the southern current\r\nin skirting the Coromandel coast brings with it quantities of sand,\r\nwhich it deposits, in tranquil weather, and this being carried by the\r\nwind is piled in heaps from Point Pedro to Hambangtotte. Hence at the\r\nlatter point hills are formed of such height and dimensions, that it is\r\noften necessary to remove buildings out of their line of\r\nencroachment.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This is occasioned by the waste of the banks further north\r\nduring the violence of the N. E. monsoon; and the sand, being carried\r\nsouth by the current, is intercepted by the headland at Hambangtotte and\r\nthrown up these hills as described.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"GOBBS\" ON THE EAST COAST]\r\n\r\nAt the mouths of the rivers the bars thus created generally follow the\r\ndirection of the current, and the material deposited being dried and\r\npartially consolidated in the intervals between the tides, long\r\nembankments are gradually raised, behind which the rivers flow for\r\nconsiderable distances before entering the sea. Occasionally these\r\nembouchures become closed by the accumulations without, and the pent-up\r\nwater assumes the appearance of a still canal, more or less broad\r\naccording to the level of the beach, and extending for miles along the\r\ncoast, between the mainland and the new formations. But when swollen by\r\nthe rains, if not assisted by artificial outlets to escape, they burst\r\nnew openings for themselves, and not unfrequently they leave their\r\nancient channels converted into shallow lagoons without any visible\r\nexit. Examples of these formations present themselves on the east side\r\nof Ceylon at Nilla-velle, Batticaloa, and a number of other places north\r\nand south of Trincomalie.\r\n\r\nOn the west coast embankments of this kind, although frequent are less\r\nconspicuous than on the east, owing chiefly to the comparative weakness\r\nof the current. For six months in the year during the north-east monsoon\r\nthat side of the island is exempt from a current in any direction, and\r\nfor the remaining six, the current from the south not only rarely\r\naffects the Gulf of Manaar, but as it flows out of the Indian Ocean it\r\nbrings no earthy deposits. In addition to this, the surf during the\r\nsouth-west monsoon rolls with such turbulence on the level beach between\r\nColombo and Point-de-Galle, as in a great degree to disperse the\r\naccumulations of sand brought down by the rivers, or heaped up by the\r\ntide, when the wind is off the land. Still, many of the rivers are\r\nthrown back by embankments, and after forming tortuous lakes flow for a\r\nlong distance parallel to the shore, before finding an escape for their\r\nwaters. Examples of this occur at Pantura, to the south of Colombo, and\r\nat Negombo, Chilaw, and elsewhere to the north of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOBBS ON THE WEST COAST]\r\n\r\nIn process of time these banks of sand[1] become covered with\r\nvegetation; herbaceous plants, shrubs, and finally trees peculiar to\r\nsaline soils make their appearance in succession, and as these decay,\r\ntheir decomposition generates a sufficiency of soil to sustain continued\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the voyages of _The Two Mahometans_, the unique MS. of\r\nwhich dates about A.D. 851, and is now in the Bibliothèque Royale at\r\nParis, Abon-zeyd, one of its authors, describes the \"Gobbs\" of Ceylon--a\r\nword, he says, by which the natives designate the valleys deep and broad\r\nwhich open to the sea. \"En face de cette íle y a de vastes _Gobb_, mot\r\npar lequel on désigne une vallée, quand elle est à la fois longue et\r\nlarge, et qu'elle débouche dans la mer. Les navigateurs emploient, pour\r\ntraverser le _gobb_ appelé 'Gobb de Serendib,' deux mois et même\r\ndavantage, passant à travers des bois et des jardins, au milieu d'une\r\ntempérature moyenne.\"--REINAUD, _Voyages faits par les Arabes_, vol. i.\r\np. 129.\r\n\r\n A misapprehension of this passage has been admitted into the English\r\nversion of the _Voyages of the two Mahometans_ which is published in\r\nPINKERTON'S _Collections of Voyages and Travels_, vol. iii.; the\r\ntranslator having treated gobb as a term applicable to valleys in\r\ngeneral. \"Ceylon,\" he says, \"contains valleys of great length, which\r\nextend to the sea, and here travellers repair for two months or more, in\r\nwhich one is called Gobb Serendib, allured by the beauty of the scenery,\r\nchequered with groves and plains, water and meadows, and blessed by a\r\nbalmy air. The valley opens to the sea, and is transcendently\r\npleasant.\"--PINKERTON'S _Voyages_, vol. vii. p. 218.\r\n\r\nBut a passage in Edrisi, while it agrees with the terms of Abou-zeyd,\r\nexplains at the same time that these gobbs were not valleys converted\r\ninto gardens, to which the seamen resorted for pleasure to spend two or\r\nthree months, but the embouchures of rivers flowing between banks,\r\ncovered with gardens and forests, into which mariners were accustomed to\r\nconduct their vessels for more secure navigation, and in which they were\r\nsubjected to detention for the period stated. The passage is as follows\r\nin Jaubert's translation of Edrisi, tom. i. p. 73:--\"Cette île\r\n(Serendib) depend des terres de l'Inde; ainsi que les vallées (in orig.\r\naghbab) par lesquelles se dechargent les rivières, et qu'on nomme\r\n'Vallées de Serendib.' Les navires y mouillent, et les navigateurs y\r\npassent un mois ou deux dans l'abondance et dans les plaisirs.\"\r\n\r\nIt is observable that Ptolemy, in enumerating the ports and harbours of\r\nCeylon, maintains a distinction between the ordinary bays, [Greek:\r\nkolpos], of which he specifies two corresponding to those of Colombo and\r\nTrincomalie, and the shallower indentations, [Greek: limên], of which he\r\nenumerates five, the positions of which go far to identify them with the\r\nremarkable estuaries or _gobbs_, on the eastern and western coast\r\nbetween Batticaloa and Calpentyn.\r\n\r\nTo the present day these latter gulfs are navigable for small craft. On\r\nthe eastern side of the island one of them forms the harbour of\r\nBatticaloa, and on the western those of Chilaw and Negombo are bays of\r\nthis class. Through the latter a continuous navigation has been\r\ncompleted by means of short connecting canals, and a traffic is\r\nmaintained during the south-west monsoon, from Caltura to the north of\r\nChilaw, a distance of upwards of eighty miles, by means of craft which\r\nnavigate these shallow channels.\r\n\r\nThese narrow passages conform in every particular to the description\r\ngiven by Abou-zeyd and Edrisi: they run through a succession of woods\r\nand gardens; and as a leading wind is indispensable for their\r\nnavigation, the period named by the Arabian geographers for their\r\npassage is perhaps not excessive during calms or adverse winds.\r\n\r\nAn article on the meaning of the word gobb will be found in the _Journal\r\nAsiatique_ for September, 1844; but it does not exhibit clearly the very\r\npeculiar features of these openings. It is contained in an extract from\r\nthe work on India of ALBYROUNI, a contemporary of Avicenna, who was born\r\nin the valley of the Indus.--\"Un golfe (gobb) est comme une encoignure\r\net un détour que fait la mer en pénétrant dans le continens: les navires\r\nn'y sont pas sans péril particulièrement à l'égard du flux et\r\nreflux.\"--_Extrait de l'ouvrage d'_ ALBYROUNI _sur l'Inde; Fragmens\r\nArabes et Persans, relatifs à l'Inde, recueillés par_ M. REINAUD;\r\n_Journ. Asiat., Septembre et Octobre_, 1844, p. 261. In the Turkish\r\nnautical work of SIDI ALI CHELEBI, the _Mohit_, written about A.D. 1550,\r\nwhich contains directions for sailors navigating the eastern seas, the\r\nauthor alludes to the _gobbha's_ on the coast of Arracan; and conscious\r\nthat the term was local not likely to be understood beyond those\r\ncountries, he adds that \"gobbha\" means \"_a gulf full of shallows,\r\nshoals, and breakers_.\" See translation by VON HAMMER, _Journ. Asiat.\r\nSoc. Beng._ v. 466.]\r\n\r\nThe process of this conversion may be seen in all its stages at various\r\npoints along the coast of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe margin of land nearest to the water is first taken possession of by\r\na series of littoral plants, which apparently require a large quantity\r\nof salt to sustain their vegetation. These at times are intermixed with\r\nothers, which, though found further inland, yet flourish in perfection\r\non the shore. On the northern and north-western coasts the glass\r\nworts[1] and salt worts[2] are the first to appear on the newly raised\r\nbanks, and being provided with penetrating roots, a breakwater is thus\r\nearly secured, and the drier sand above becomes occupied with creeping\r\nplants which in their turn afford shelter to a third and erect class.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Salicornia Indica.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Salsola Indica.]\r\n\r\nThe Goat's-foot Ipomoea[1], which appears to encircle the world, abounds\r\non these shores, covering the surface to the water's edge with its\r\nprocumbent branches, which sending down roots from every joint serve to\r\ngive the bank its first firmness, whilst the profusion of its\r\npurple-coloured flowers contrasts strikingly with its dark green\r\nfoliage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Ipomoea pes-capræ]\r\n\r\nAlong with the Ipomoea grow two species of beans[1] each endowed with a\r\npeculiar facility for reproduction, thus consolidating the sands into\r\nwhich they strike; and the moodu-gaeta-kola[2] (literally the \"jointed\r\nseashore plant,\") with pink flowers and thick succulent leaves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Mooduawara (_Canavalia obtusifolia_), whose flowers\r\nhave the fragrance of the sweet pea, and _Dolichos luteus_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Hydrophylax maritima.]\r\n\r\nAnother plant which performs an important function in the fertilisation\r\nof these arid formations, is the _Spinifex squarrosus_, the \"water\r\npink,\" as it is sometimes called by Europeans. The seeds of this plant\r\nare contained in a circular head, composed of a series of spine-like\r\ndivisions, which radiate from the stalk in all directions, making the\r\ndiameter of the whole about eight to nine inches. When the seeds are\r\nmature, and ready for dispersion, these heads become detached from the\r\nplant, and are carried by the wind with great velocity along the sands,\r\nover the surface of which they are impelled on their elastic spines. One\r\nof these balls may be followed by the eye for miles as it hurries along\r\nthe level shore, dropping its seeds as it rolls, which speedily\r\ngerminate and strike root where they fall. The globular heads are so\r\nbuoyant as to float lightly on the water, and the uppermost spines\r\nacting as sails, they are thus carried across narrow estuaries to\r\ncontinue the process of embanking on newly-formed sand bars. Such an\r\norganisation irresistibly suggests the wonderful means ordained by\r\nProvidence to spread this valuable plant along the barren beach to which\r\nno seed-devouring bird ever resorts; and even the unobservant natives,\r\nstruck by its singular utility in resisting the encroachments of the\r\nsea, have recorded their admiration by conferring on it the name of\r\n_Maha-Rawana roewula_,--\"the great beard of Rawana or Rama.\"\r\n\r\nThe banks being thus ingeniously protected from the action of the air\r\nabove, and of the water at their base, other herbaceous plants soon\r\ncover them in quick succession, and give the entire surface the first\r\naspect of vegetation. A little retired above high water are to be found\r\na species of _Aristolochia_[1], the Sayan[2], or _Choya_, the roots of\r\nwhich are the Indian Madder (in which, under the Dutch Government, some\r\ntribes in the Wanny paid their tribute); the gorgeous _Gloriosa\r\nsuperba_, the beautiful _Vistnu-karandi_[3] with its profusion of blue\r\nflowers, which remind one of the English \"Forget-me-not,\" and the\r\nthickly-matted verdure of the _Hiramana-doetta_[4], so well adapted for\r\nimparting consistency to the soil. In the next stage low shrubs make\r\ntheir appearance, their seeds being drifted by the waves and wind, and\r\ntaking ready root wherever they happen to rest. The foremost of these\r\nare the Scævolas[5] and Screw Pines[6], which grow luxuriantly within\r\nthe actual wash of the tide, while behind them rises a dense growth of\r\npeculiar plants, each distinguished by the Singhalese by the prefix of\r\n\"Moodu,\" to indicate its partiality for the sea.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Aristolocia bracteata_. On the sands to the north of\r\nCeylon there is also the _A. Indica_, which forms the food of the great\r\nred and white butterfly (_Papilio Hector_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Hedyotis umbellata_. A very curious account of the Dutch\r\npolicy In relation to Choya dye will be found in a paper _On the\r\nVegetable Productions of Ceylon_, by W.C. ONDAATJIE, in the _Ceylon\r\nCalendar_ for 1853. See also BERTOLACCI, B. iii. p. 270.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Evolvulus alsinoides.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Lippia nodiflora.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Scævola takkada and S. Koenigii]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Pandanus odoratissimus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Moodu-kaduru (Ochrosia parviflora); Moodu-cobbe\r\n(Ornitrophe serrata); Moodu-murunga (Sophora tomentosa_,) &c. &c.\r\nAmongst these marine shrubs the Nil-picha (_Guettarda speciosca_), with\r\nits white and delightfully fragrant flowers, is a conspicuous object on\r\nsome parts of the sea-shore between Colombo and Point-de-Galle.]\r\n\r\nWhere the sand in the lagoons and estuaries is more or less mingled with\r\nthe alluvium brought down by the rivers, there are plants of another\r\nclass which are equally characteristic. Amongst these the Mangroves[1]\r\ntake the first place in respect to their mass of vegetation; then follow\r\nthe Belli-patta[2] and Suriya-gaha[3], with their large hibiscus-like\r\nflowers; the Tamarisks[4]; the Acanthus[5], with its beautiful blue\r\npetals and holly-like leaves; the Water Coco-nut[6]; the Ægiceras and\r\nHernandia[7], with its sonorous fruits; while the dry sands above are\r\ntaken possession of by the Acacias, _Salvadora Persica_ (the true\r\nmustard-tree of Scripture[8], which, here attains a height of forty\r\nfeet), Ixoras, and the numerous family of Cassias.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Two species of _Rhizophora_, two of _Bruguiera_, and one of\r\n_Ceriops_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Paritimn tilliaceum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Thespesia populnea.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Tamarix Indica.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Dilivaria ilicifolia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Nipa fruticans.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Hernandia sonora.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The identification of this tree with the mustard-tree\r\nalluded to by our Saviour is an interesting fact. The Greek term [Greek:\r\nsinapis], which occurs Matt. xiii 31, and elsewhere, is the name given\r\nto _mustard_; for which the Arabic equivalent is _chardul_ or _khardal_,\r\nand the Syriac _khardalo_. The same name is applied at the present day\r\nto a tree which grows freely in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, and\r\ngenerally throughout Palestine; the seeds of which, have an aromatic\r\npungency, which enables them to be used instead of the ordinary mustard\r\n(_Sinapis nigra_); besides which, its structure presents all the\r\nessentials to sustain the illustration sought to be established in the\r\nparable, some of which are wanting or dubious in the common plant, It\r\nhas a very small seed; it may be sown in a garden: it grows into an\r\n\"herb,\" and eventually \"becometh a tree; so that the birds of the air\r\ncome and lodge in the branches thereof.\" With every allowance for the\r\nextremest development attainable by culture, it must be felt that the\r\ndimensions of the domestic _sinapis_ scarcely justify the last\r\nillustration; besides which it is an annual, and cannot possibly be\r\nclassed as a \"tree.\" The khardal grows abundantly in Syria: it was found\r\nin Egypt by Sir Gardner Wilkinson; in Arabia by Bové; on the Indus by\r\nSir Alexander Burnes; and throughout the north-west of India it bears\r\nthe name of kharjal. Combining all these facts, Dr. Royle, in an erudite\r\npaper, has shown demonstrative reasons for believing that the _Salvadora\r\nPersica_, the \"kharjal\" of Hindostan, is the \"khardal\" of Arabia, the\r\n\"chardul\" of the Talmud, and the \"mustard-tree\" of the parable.]\r\n\r\nLastly, after a sufficiency of earth has been formed by the decay of\r\nfrequent successions of their less important predecessors, the ground\r\nbecomes covered by trees of ampler magnitude, most of which are found\r\nupon the adjacent shores of the mainland--the Margoza[1], from whose\r\nseed the natives express a valuable oil; the Timbiri[2], with the\r\nglutinous nuts with which the fishermen \"bark\" their nets; the\r\nCashu-nut[3]; the Palu[4], one of the most valuable timber trees of the\r\nNorthern Provinces; and the Wood-apple[5], whose fruit is regarded by\r\nthe Singhalese as a specific for dysentery.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Azadirachta Indica.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Diospyros glutinosa.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Anacardium occidentale.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Mimusopa hexandra.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Ægle marmelos.]\r\n\r\nBut the most important fact connected with these recently formed\r\nportions of land, is their extraordinary suitability for the growth of\r\nthe coco-nut, which requires the sea-air (and in Ceylon at least appears\r\nnever to attain its full luxuriance when removed to any considerable\r\ndistance from it)[1], and which, at the same time, requires a light and\r\nsandy soil, and the constant presence of water in large quantities. All\r\nthese essentials are combined in the sea-belts here described, lying as\r\nthey do between the ocean on the one side and the fresh-water lakes\r\nformed by the great rivers on the other, thus presenting every requisite\r\nof soil and surface. It is along a sand formation of this description,\r\nabout forty miles long and from one to three miles broad, that thriving\r\ncoco-nut plantations have been recently commenced at Batticaloa. At\r\nCalpentyn, on the western coast, a like formation has been taken\r\nadvantage of for the same purpose. At Jaffna somewhat similar\r\npeculiarities of soil and locality have been seized on for this\r\npromising cultivation; and, generally, along the whole seaborde of\r\nCeylon to the south and west, the shore for the breadth of one or two\r\nmiles exhibits almost continuous groves of coco-nut palms.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Coco-nuts are cultivated at moderate elevations in the\r\nmountain villages of the Interior; but the fruit bears no comparison, in\r\nnumber, size, or weight, with that produced in the lowlands, and near\r\nthe sea, on either side of the island.]\r\n\r\n_Harbours_.--With the exception of the estuaries above alluded to,\r\nchiefly in the northern section of the island, the outline of the coast\r\nis interrupted by few sinuosities. There are no extensive inlets, or\r\nbays, and only two harbours--that of _Point-de-Galle_ which, in addition\r\nto being incommodious and small, is obstructed by coral rocks, reefs of\r\nwhich have been upreared to the surface, and render the entrance\r\ncritical to strange ships[1]; and the magnificent basin of Trincomalie,\r\nwhich, in extent, security, and beauty, is unsurpassed by any haven in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Owing to the obstructions at its entrance, Galle is\r\nextremely difficult of access in particular winds. In 1857 it was\r\nannounced in the _Colombo Examiner_ that \"the fine ship the 'Black\r\nEagle' was blown out of Galle Roads the other day, with the pilot on\r\nboard; whilst the captain was temporarily engaged on shore; and as she\r\nwas not able to beat in again, she made for Trincomalie, where she has\r\nbeen lying for a fortnight. Such an event is by no means unprecedented\r\nat Galle.\"--_Examiner_, 20 Sept. 1857.]\r\n\r\n_Tides_.--The variation of the tides is so slight that navigation is\r\nalmost unaffected by it. The ordinary rise and fall is from 18 to 24\r\ninches, with an increase of about a third at spring tides. High water is\r\nlater on the eastern than on the western coast; occurring, on full and\r\nnew moon, a little after eleven o'clock at Adam's Bridge, about 1\r\no'clock at Colombo, and 1.25 at Galle, whilst it attains its greatest\r\nelevation between 5 and 6 o'clock in the harbour of Trincomalie.\r\n\r\n_Red infusoria_.--On both sides of the island (but most frequently at\r\nColombo), during the south-west monsoon, a broad expanse of the sea\r\nassumes a red tinge, considerably brighter than brick-dust; and this is\r\nconfined to a space so distinct that a line seems to separate it from\r\nthe green water which flows on either side. Observing that the whole\r\narea changed its position without parting with any portion of its\r\ncolouring, I had some of the water brought on shore, and, on examination\r\nwith the microscope, it proved to be filled with _infusoria_, probably\r\nsimilar to those which have been noticed near the shores of South\r\nAmerica, and whose abundance has imparted a name to the \"Vermilion Sea\"\r\noff the coast of California.\r\n\r\nTHE POPULATION OF CEYLON, of all races, was, in 1857, 1,697,975; but\r\nthis was exclusive of the military and their families, both Europeans\r\nand Malays, which together amounted to 5,430; and also of aliens and\r\nother casual strangers, forming about 25,000 more.\r\n\r\nThe particulars are as follow:--\r\n\r\n|Provinces   |Whites.        |Coloured.      |Total.     |Population|\r\n|       |Males.|Females.|Males.|Females.|Males.|Females. | to the   |\r\n                                                         |sq. mile. |\r\n|Western.   |1,293|1,246|293,409|259,106|294,702|260,352 |  146.59  |\r\n|N.

II.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.--HEALTH AND DISEASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climate of Ceylon, from its physical configuration and insular\r\ndetachment, contrasts favourably with that of the great Indian\r\npeninsula. Owing to the moderate dimensions of the island, the elevation\r\nof its mountains, the very short space during which the sun is passing\r\nover it[1] in his regression from or approach to the solstices, and its\r\nsurrounding seas being nearly uniform in temperature, it is exempt from\r\nthe extremes of heating and cooling to which the neighbouring continent\r\nof India is exposed. From the same causes it is subjected more uniformly\r\nto the genial influences of the trade winds that blow over the Indian\r\nOcean and the Bay of Bengal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In his approach to the northern solstice, the sun, having\r\npassed the equator on the 21st of March, reaches the south of Ceylon\r\nabout the 5th of April, and ten days later is vertical over Point Pedro,\r\nthe northern extremity of the island. On his return he is again over\r\nPoint Pedro about the 27th of August, and passes southward over Dondera\r\nHead about the 7th of September.]\r\n\r\nThe island is seldom visited by hurricanes[1], or swept by typhoons, and\r\nthe breeze, unlike the hot and arid winds of Coromandel and the Dekkan,\r\nis always more or less refreshing. The range of the thermometer exhibits\r\nno violent changes, and never indicates a temperature insupportably\r\nhigh. The mean on an annual average scarcely exceeds 80° at Colombo,\r\nthough in exceptional years it has risen to 86°. But at no period of the\r\nday are dangerous results to be apprehended from exposure to the sun;\r\nand except during parts of the months of March, and April, there is no\r\nseason when moderate exercise is not practicable and agreeable. For half\r\nthe year, from October to May, the prevailing winds are from the\r\nnorth-east, and during the remaining months the south-west monsoon blows\r\nsteadily from the great Indian Ocean. The former, affected by the wintry\r\nchills of the vast tracts of land which it traverses before crossing the\r\nBay of Bengal, is subject to many local variations and intervals of\r\ncalm. But the latter, after the first violence of its outset is abated,\r\nbecomes nearly uniform throughout the period of its prevalence, and\r\npresents the character of an on-shore breeze extending over a prodigious\r\nexpanse of sea and land, and exerting a powerful influence along the\r\nregions of southern Asia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The exception to the exemption of Ceylon from hurricanes is\r\nthe occasional occurrence of a cyclone extending its circle till the\r\nverge has sometimes touched Batticaloa, on the south-eastern extremity\r\nof the island, causing damage to vegetation and buildings. Such an event\r\nis, however, exceedingly rare. On the 7th of January, 1805, H.M.S.\r\n\"Sheerness\" and two others were driven on shore in a hurricane at\r\nTrincomalie.]\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon the proverbial fickleness of the winds, and the uncertainty\r\nwhich characterises the seasons in northern climates, is comparatively\r\nunknown; and the occurrence of changes or rain may be anticipated with\r\nconsiderable accuracy in any month of a coming year. There are, of\r\ncourse, abnormal seasons with higher ranges of temperature, heavier\r\nrains, or droughts of longer continuance, but such extremes are\r\nexceptional and rare. Great atmospheric changes occur only at two\r\nopposite periods of the year, and so gradual is their approach that the\r\nclimate is monotonous, and one longs to see again \"the falling of the\r\nleaf\" to diversify the sameness of perennial verdure. The line is faint\r\nwhich divides the seasons. No period of the year is divested of its\r\nseed-time and its harvest in some part of the island; and fruit hangs\r\nripe on the same branches that are garlanded with opening buds. But as\r\nevery plant has its own period for the production of its flowers and\r\nfruit, each month is characterised by its own peculiar flora.\r\n\r\nAs regards the foliage of the trees, it might be expected that the\r\nvariety of tints would be wanting which forms the charm of a European\r\nlandscape, and that all nature would wear one mantle of unchanging\r\ngreen. But it has been remarked by a tasteful observer[1] that such is\r\nfar from the fact, and though in Ceylon there is no revolution of\r\nseasons, the change of leaf on the same plant exhibits colours as bright\r\nas those which tinge the autumnal woods of America. It is not the\r\ndecaying leaves, but the fresh shoots, which exhibit these brightened\r\ncolours, the older are still vividly green, whilst the young are\r\nbursting forth; and the extremities of the branches present tufts of\r\npale yellow, pink, crimson, and purple, which give them at a distance\r\nthe appearance of a cluster of flowers.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Prof. Harvey, Trin. Coll. Dublin.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Some few trees, such as the margosa (_Azadirachta Indica_),\r\nthe country almond (_Terminalia catappa_), and others, are deciduous,\r\nand part with their leaves. The cinnamon shoots forth in all shades from\r\nbright yellow to dark crimson. The maella _(Olax Zeylanica)_ has always\r\na copper colour; and the ironwood trees of the interior have a perfect\r\nblaze of young crimson leaves, as brilliant as flowers. The lovi-lovi\r\n(_Flacourtia inermis_) has the same peculiarity; while the large bracts\r\nof the mussænda (_Mussænda frondosa_) attract the notice of Europeans\r\nfor their angular whiteness.]\r\n\r\nA notice of the variations exhibited by the weather at Colombo may serve\r\nas an index to the atmospheric condition of the rest of the island,\r\nexcept in those portions (such as the mountains of the interior, and the\r\nlow plains of the northern extremity) which exhibit modifications of\r\ntemperature and moisture incident to local peculiarities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:\r\nWind N.E.\r\nTemperature, 24 hours:\r\n  Mean greatest    85.6º\r\n  Mean least       69.2º\r\nRain (inches)       3.1]\r\n\r\n_January_.--At the opening of the year, the north-east monsoon, which\r\nsets in two months previously, is nearly in mid career. This wind,\r\nissuing from the chill north and robbed of its aqueous vapour in passing\r\nover the elevated mountain regions on the confines of China and Thibet,\r\nsweeps across the Bay of Bengal, whence its lowest strata imbibe a\r\nquantity of moisture, moderate in amount, yet still leaving the great\r\nmass of air far below saturation. Hence it reaches Ceylon comparatively\r\ndry, and its general effects are parching and disagreeable. This\r\ncharacter is increased as the sun recedes towards its most southern\r\ndeclination, and the wind acquires a more direct draught from the north;\r\npassing over the Indian peninsula and almost totally digested of\r\nhumidity, it blows down the western coast of the island, and is known\r\nthere by the name of the \"along-shore-wind.\" For a time its influence is\r\nuncomfortable and its effects injurious both to health and vegetation:\r\nit warps and rends furniture, dries up the surface of the earth, and\r\nwithers the delicate verdure which had sprung up during the prevalence\r\nof the previous rains. These characteristics, however, subside towards\r\nthe end of the month, when the wind becomes somewhat variable with a\r\nwesterly tendency and occasional showers; and the heat of the day is\r\nthen partially compensated by the greater freshness of the nights. The\r\nfall of rain within the month scarcely exceeds three inches.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:\r\nWind N.E.\r\nTemperature, 24 hours:\r\n  Mean greatest    89°\r\n  Mean least       71°\r\nRain (inches)     2.1]\r\n\r\n_February_ is dry and hot during the day, but the nights are cloudless\r\nand cool, and the moonlight singularly agreeable. Rain is rare, and when\r\nit occurs it falls in dashes, succeeded by damp and sultry calms. The\r\nwind is unsteady and shifts from north-east to north-west, sometimes\r\nfailing entirely between noon and twilight. The quantity of rain is less\r\nthan in January, and the difference of temperature between day and night\r\nis frequently as great as 15° or 20°.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. MACVICAR, in a paper in the _Ceylon Miscellany_, July,\r\n1843, recorded the results of some experiments, made near Colombo, as to\r\nthe daily variation of temperature and Its effects on cultivation, from\r\nwhich it appeared that a register thermometer, exposed on a tuft of\r\ngrass in the cinnamon garden in a clear night and under the open sky, on\r\nthe 2nd of January, 1841, showed in the morning that it had been so low\r\nas 52°, and when laid on the ground in the place in the sunshine on the\r\nfollowing day, it rose to upwards of 140° Fahr.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:\r\nWind N.E. to N.W.\r\nTemperature, 24 hours:\r\n  Mean greatest    87.7°\r\n  Mean least       73.1°\r\nRain (inches)       2.1]\r\n\r\n_March_.--In March the heat continues to increase, the earth receiving\r\nmore warmth than it radiates or parts with by evaporation. The day\r\nbecomes oppressive, the nights unrefreshing, the grass is withered and\r\nbrown, the earth hard and cleft, the lakes shrunk to shallows, and the\r\nrivers evaporated to dryness. Europeans now escape from the low country,\r\nand betake themselves to the shade of the forests adjoining the\r\ncoffee-plantations in the hills; or to the still higher sanatarium of\r\nNeuera-ellia, nearly the loftiest plateau in the mountains of the\r\nKandyan range. The winds, when any are perceptible, are faint and\r\nunsteady with a still increasing westerly tendency, partial showers\r\nsometimes fall, and thunder begins to mutter towards sunset. At the\r\nclose of the month, the mean temperature will be found to have advanced\r\nabout a degree, but the sensible temperature and the force of the sun's\r\nrays are felt in a still more perceptible proportion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:\r\nWind N.W. to S.W.\r\nTemperature, 24 hours:\r\n  Mean greatest    88.7°\r\n  Mean least       73.6°\r\nRain (inches)       7.4]\r\n\r\n_April_ is by far the most oppressive portion of the year for those who\r\nremain at the sea-level of the island. The temperature continues to rise\r\nas the sun in his northern progress passes vertically over the island. A\r\nmirage fills the hollows with mimic water; the heat in close apartments\r\nbecomes extreme, and every living creature flies to the shade from the\r\nsuffocating glare of mid-day. At length the sea exhibits symptoms of an\r\napproaching change, a ground swell sets in from the west, and the breeze\r\ntowards sunset brings clouds and grateful showers. At the end of the\r\nmonth the mean temperature attains its greatest height during the year,\r\nbeing about 83° in the day, and 10° lower at night.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:\r\nWind N.W. to S.W.\r\nTemperature, 24 hours:\r\n  Mean greatest    87.2°\r\n  Mean least       72.9°\r\nRain (inches)      13.3]\r\n\r\n_May_ is signalised by the great event of the change of the monsoon, and\r\nall the grand phenomena which accompany its approach.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for any one who has not resided in the tropics to\r\ncomprehend the feeling of enjoyment which accompanies these periodical\r\ncommotions of the atmosphere; in Europe they would be fraught with\r\nannoyance, but in Ceylon they are welcomed with a relish proportionate\r\nto the monotony they dispel.\r\n\r\nLong before the wished-for period arrives, the verdure produced by the\r\nprevious rains becomes almost obliterated by the burning droughts of\r\nMarch and April. The deciduous trees shed their foliage, the plants\r\ncease to put forth fresh leaves, and all vegetable life languishes under\r\nthe unwholesome heat. The grass withers on the baked and cloven earth,\r\nand red dust settles on the branches and thirsty brushwood. The insects,\r\ndeprived of their accustomed food, disappear underground or hide beneath\r\nthe decaying bark; the water-beetles bury themselves in the hardened mud\r\nof the pools, and the _helices_ retire into the crevices of the stones\r\nor the hollows amongst the roots of the trees, closing the apertures of\r\ntheir shells with the hybernating epiphragm. Butterflies are no longer\r\nseen hovering over the flowers, the birds appear fewer and less joyous,\r\nand the wild animals and crocodiles, driven by the drought from their\r\naccustomed retreats, wander through the jungle, and even venture to\r\napproach the village wells in search of water. Man equally languishes\r\nunder the general exhaustion, ordinary exertion becomes distasteful, and\r\nthe native Singhalese, although inured to the climate, move with\r\nlassitude and reluctance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the air becomes loaded to saturation with aqueous vapour drawn\r\nup by the augmented force of evaporation acting vigorously over land and\r\nsea: the sky, instead of its brilliant blue, assumes the sullen tint of\r\nlead, and not a breath disturbs the motionless rest of the clouds that\r\nhang on the lower range of hills. At length, generally about the middle\r\nof the month, but frequently earlier, the sultry suspense is broken by\r\nthe arrival of the wished-for change. The sun has by this time nearly\r\nattained his greatest northern declination, and created a torrid heat\r\nthroughout the lands of southern Asia and the peninsula of India. The\r\nair, lightened by its high temperature and such watery vapour as it may\r\ncontain, rises into loftier regions and is replaced by indraughts from\r\nthe neighbouring sea, and thus a tendency is gradually given to the\r\nformation of a current bringing up from the south the warm humid air of\r\nthe equator. The wind, therefore, which reaches Ceylon comes laden with\r\nmoisture, taken up in its passage across the great Indian Ocean. As the\r\nmonsoon draws near, the days become more overcast and hot, banks of\r\nclouds rise over the ocean to the west, and in the peculiar twilight the\r\neye is attracted by the unusual whiteness of the sea-birds that sweep\r\nalong the strand to seize the objects flung on shore by the rising surf.\r\n\r\nAt last the sudden lightnings flash among the hills and sheet through\r\nthe clouds that overhang the sea[1], and with a crash of thunder the\r\nmonsoon bursts over the thirsty land, not in showers or partial\r\ntorrents, but in a wide deluge, that in the course of a few hours\r\novertops the river banks and spreads in inundations over every level\r\nplain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The lightnings of Ceylon are so remarkable, that in the\r\nmiddle ages they were as well known to the Arabian seamen, who coasted\r\nthe island on their way to China, as in later times the storms that\r\ninfested the Cape of Good Hope were familiar to early navigators of\r\nPortugal. In the _Mohit_ of SIDI ALI CHELEBI, translated by Von Hammer,\r\nit is stated that to seamen, sailing from Diu to Malacca, \"the sign of\r\nCeylon being near is continual lightning, be it accompanied by rain or\r\nwithout rain; so that 'the lightning of Ceylon' is proverbial for a\r\nliar!\"--_Journ. Asiat. Soc. Beng._ v. 465.]\r\n\r\nAll the phenomena of this explosion are stupendous: thunder, as we are\r\naccustomed to be awed by it in Europe, affords but the faintest idea of\r\nits overpowering grandeur in Ceylon, and its sublimity is infinitely\r\nincreased as it is faintly heard from the shore, resounding through\r\nnight and darkness over the gloomy sea. The lightning, when it touches\r\nthe earth where it is covered with the descending torrent, flashes into\r\nit and disappears instantaneously; but, when it strikes a drier surface,\r\nin seeking better conductors, it often opens a hollow like that formed\r\nby the explosion of a shell, and frequently leaves behind it traces of\r\nvitrification.[1] In Ceylon, however, occurrences of this kind are rare,\r\nand accidents are seldom recorded from lightning, probably owing to the\r\nprofusion of trees, and especially of coco-nut palms, which, when\r\ndrenched with rain, intercept the discharge, and conduct the electric\r\nmatter to the earth. The rain at these periods excites the astonishment\r\nof a European: it descends in almost continuous streams, so close and so\r\ndense that the level ground, unable to absorb it sufficiently fast, is\r\ncovered with one uniform sheet of water, and down the sides of\r\nacclivities it rushes in a volume that wears channels in the surface.[2]\r\nFor hours together, the noise of the torrent, as it beats upon the trees\r\nand bursts upon the roofs, flowing thence in rivulets along the ground,\r\noccasions an uproar that drowns the ordinary voice, and renders sleep\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See DARWIN'S _Naturalist's Voyage_, ch. iii. for an account\r\nof those vitrified siliceous tubes which are formed by lightning\r\nentering loose sand. During a thunderstorm which passed over Galle, on\r\nthe 16th May, 1854, the fortifications were shaken by lightning, and an\r\nextraordinary cavity was opened behind the retaining wall of the\r\nrampart, where a hole, a yard in diameter, was carried into the ground\r\nto the depth of twenty feet, and two chambers, each six feet in length,\r\nbranched out on either side at its extremity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: One morning on awaking  at Pusilawa, in the hills between\r\nKandy and Neuera-ellia, I was taken to see the effect of a few hours'\r\nrain, during the night, on a macadamised road which I had passed the\r\nevening before. There was no symptom of a storm at sunset, and the\r\nmorning was bright and cloudless; but between midnight and dawn such an\r\ninundation had swept the highway that in many places the metal had been\r\nwashed over the face of the acclivity; and in one spot where a sudden\r\nbend forced the torrent to impinge against the bank, it had scooped out\r\nan excavation extending to the centre of the high road, thirteen feet in\r\ndiameter, and deep enough to hold a carriage and horses.]\r\n\r\nThis violence, however, seldom lasts more than an hour or two, and\r\ngradually abates after intermittent paroxysms, and a serenely clear sky\r\nsupervenes. For some days, heavy showers continue to fall at intervals\r\nin the forenoon; and the evenings which follow are embellished by\r\nsunsets of the most gorgeous splendour, lighting the fragments of clouds\r\nthat survive the recent storm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:\r\nWind S.W.\r\nTemperature, 24 hours:\r\n Mean greatest   85.8°\r\n Mean least      74.4°\r\nRain (inches)     6.8]\r\n\r\n_June_.--The extreme heat of the previous month becomes modified in\r\nJune: the winds continue steadily to blow from the south-west, and\r\nfrequent showers, accompanied by lightning and thunder, serve still\r\nfurther to diffuse coolness throughout the atmosphere and verdure over\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nSo instantaneous is the response of Nature to the influence of returning\r\nmoisture, that, in a single day, and almost between sunset and dawn, the\r\ngreen hue of reviving vegetation begins to tint the saturated ground. In\r\nponds, from which but a week before the wind blew clouds of sandy dust,\r\nthe peasantry are now to be seen catching the re-animated fish; and\r\ntank-shells and water-beetles revive and wander over the submerged\r\nsedges. The electricity of the air stimulates the vegetation of the\r\ntrees; and scarce a week will elapse till the plants are covered with\r\nthe larvæ of butterflies, the forest murmuring with the hum of insects,\r\nand the air harmonious with the voice of birds.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the temperature is reduced, after the first burst of\r\nthe monsoon, is not to be appreciated by the indications of the\r\nthermometer alone, but is rendered still more sensible by the altered\r\ndensity of the air, the drier state of which is favourable to\r\nevaporation, whilst the increase of its movement bringing it more\r\nrapidly in contact with the human body, heat is more readily carried\r\noff, and the coolness of the surface proportionally increased. It\r\noccasionally happens during the month of June that the westerly wind\r\nacquires considerable strength, sometimes amounting to a moderate gale.\r\nThe fishermen, at this period, seldom put to sea: their canoes are drawn\r\nfar up in lines upon the shore, and vessels riding in the roads of\r\nColombo are often driven from their anchorage and stranded on the beach.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:\r\nWind S.W.\r\nTemperature, 24 hours:\r\n  Mean greatest    84.8º\r\n  Mean least       74.9º\r\nRain (inches)       3.4]\r\n\r\n_July_ resembles, to a great extent, the month which precedes it, except\r\nthat, in all particulars the season is more moderate, showers are less\r\nfrequent, there is less wind, and less absolute heat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:\r\nWind S.W.\r\nTemperature, 24 hours:\r\n  Mean greatest     84.9°\r\n  Mean least        74.7°\r\n  Rain (inches)      2.8]\r\n\r\n_August_.--In August the weather is charming, notwithstanding\r\nwithstanding a slight increase of heat, owing to diminished evaporation;\r\nand the sun being now on its return to the equator, its power is felt in\r\ngreater force on full exposure to its influence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:\r\nWind S.W.\r\nTemperature, 24 hours:\r\n  Mean greatest     84.9º\r\n  Mean least        74.8º\r\nRain (inches)        5.2]\r\n\r\n_September_.--The same atmospheric condition continues throughout\r\nSeptember, but towards its close the sea-breeze becomes unsteady and\r\nclouds begin to collect, symptomatic of the approaching change to the\r\nnorth-east monsoon.

In the early part of the month the wind visits nearly\r\nevery point of the compass, but shows a marked predilection for the\r\nnorth, generally veering from N.E. at night and early morning, to N.W.\r\nat noon; calms are frequent and precede gentle showers, and clouds form\r\nround the lower range of hills. By degrees as the sun advances in its\r\nsouthern declination, and warms the lower half of the great African\r\ncontinent, the current of heated air ascending from the equatorial belt\r\nleaves a comparative vacuum, towards which the less rarefied atmospheric\r\nfluid is drawn down from the regions north, of the tropic, bringing with\r\nit the cold and dry winds from the Himalayan Alps, and the lofty ranges\r\nof Assam. The great change is heralded as before by oppressive calms,\r\nlurid skies, vivid lightning, bursts of thunder, and tumultuous rain.\r\nBut at this change of the monsoon the atmospheric disturbance is less\r\nstriking than in May; the previous temperature is lower, the moisture of\r\nthe air is more reduced, and the change is less agreeably perceptible\r\nfrom the southern breeze to the dry and parching wind from the north.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:\r\nWind N.E.\r\nTemperature 24 hours:\r\n  Mean greatest    85°\r\n  Mean least       70°\r\nRain (inches)      4.3]\r\n\r\n_December_.--In December the sun attains to its greatest southern\r\ndeclination, and the wind setting steadily from the northeast brings\r\nwith it light but frequent rains from Bay Of Bengal. The thermometer\r\nshows a maximum temperature of 85° with a minimum of 70°; the morning\r\nand the afternoon are again enjoyable in the open air, but at night\r\nevery lattice that faces the north is cautiously closed against the\r\ntreacherous \"along-shore-wind.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the violence and volume in which the rains have been\r\nhere described as descending during the paroxysms of the monsoons, the\r\ntotal rain-fall in Ceylon is considerably less than on the continent of\r\nThroughout Hindustan the annual mean is 117.5 and on some parts on the\r\nMalabar coast, upwards of 300 inches have fallen in a single year[1];\r\nwhereas the in Ceylon rarely exceeds 80, and the highest registered in\r\nan exceptional season was 120 inches.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: At Mahabaleshwar, in the Western Ghauts, the annual mean is\r\n254 inches, and at Uttray Mullay; in Malabar, 263; whilst at Bengal it\r\nis 209 inches at Sylhet; and 610.3 at Cherraponga.]\r\n\r\nThe distribution is of course unequal, both as to time and localities,\r\nand in those districts where the fall is most considerable, the number\r\nof rainless days is the greatest.[1] An idea may be formed of the deluge\r\nthat descends in Colombo during the change of the monsoon, from the fact\r\nthat out of 72.4 inches, the annual average there, no less than 20.7\r\ninches fall in April and May, and 21.9 in October and November, a\r\nquantity one-third greater than the total rain in England throughout an\r\nentire year.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The average number of days on which rain fell at Colombo in\r\nthe years 1832, 1833, 1834, and 1835, was as follows:--\r\n\r\n                   Days.\r\n  In January           3\r\n     February          4\r\n     March             6\r\n     April            11\r\n     May              13\r\n     June             13\r\n     July              8\r\n     August           10\r\n     September        14\r\n     October          17\r\n     November         11\r\n     December          8\r\n                     ---\r\n    Total            118]\r\n\r\nIn one important particular the phenomenon, of the Dekkan affords an\r\nanalogy for that which presents itself in Ceylon. During the south-west\r\nmonsoon the clouds are driven against the lofty chain of mountains that\r\noverhang the western shore of the peninsula, and their condensed vapour\r\ndescends there in copious showers. The winds, thus early robbed of their\r\nmoisture, carry but little rain to the plains of the interior, and\r\nwhilst Malabar is saturated by daily showers, the sky of Coromandel is\r\nclear and serene. In the north-east monsoon a condition the very\r\nopposite exists; the wind that then prevails is much drier, and the\r\nhills which it encounters being of lower altitude, the rains are carried\r\nfurther towards the interior, and whilst the weather is unsettled and\r\nstormy on the eastern shore, the western is comparatively exempt, and\r\nenjoys a calm and cloudless sky.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The mean of rain is, on the western side of the Dekkan, 80\r\ninches, and on the eastern, 52.8.]\r\n\r\nIn like manner the west coast of Ceylon presents a contrast with the\r\neast, both in the volume of rain in each of the respective monsoons, and\r\nin the influence which the same monsoon exerts simultaneously on the one\r\nside of the island and on the other. The greatest quantity of rain falls\r\non the south-western portion, in the month of May, when the wind from\r\nthe Indian Ocean is intercepted, and its moisture condensed by the lofty\r\nmountain ranges, surrounding Adam's Peak. The region principally\r\naffected by it stretches from Point-de-Galle, as far north as Putlam,\r\nand eastward till it includes the greater portion of the ancient Kandyan\r\nkingdom. But the rains do not reach the opposite side of the island;\r\nwhilst the west coast is deluged, the east is sometimes exhausted with\r\ndryness; and it not unfrequently happens that different aspects of the\r\nsame mountain present at the same moment the opposite extremes of\r\ndrought and moisture.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: ADMIRAL FITZROY has described, in his _Narrative of the\r\nVoyages of the Adventure and Beagle_, the striking degree in which this\r\nsimultaneous dissimilarity of climate is exhibited on opposite sides of\r\nthe Galapagos Islands; one aspect exposed to the south being covered\r\nwith verdure and freshened with moisture, whilst all others are barren\r\nand parched.--Vol. ii. p. 502-3. The same state of things exists in the\r\neast and west sides of the Peruvian Andes, and in the mountains of\r\nPatagonia. And no more remarkable example of it exists than in the\r\nisland of Socotra, east of the Straits of Bab el Mandeb, the west coast\r\nof which, during the north-east monsoon, is destitute of rain and\r\nverdure, whilst the eastern side is enriched by streams and covered by\r\nluxuriant pasturage.--_Journ. Asiat. Soc. Beng._ vol. iv. p. 141.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM EXHIBITING THE COMPARATIVE FALL OF RAIN ON THE\r\nSEABORDE OF THE DEEKAN, AND AT COLOMBO, IN THE WESTERN PROVINCE OF\r\nCEYLON.\r\n\r\nOne maximum at the spring change of the monsoon anticipating a little\r\nthat on the West coast of India; another at the autumnal change\r\ncorresponding more exactly with that of the East coast. The entire fall\r\nthrough the year more equably distributed at Columbo.]\r\n\r\nOn the east coast, on the other hand, the fall, during the north-east\r\nmonsoon, is very similar in degree to that on the coast of Coromandel,\r\nas the mountains are lower and more remote from the sea, the clouds are\r\ncarried farther inland and it rains simultaneously on both sides of the\r\nisland, though much less on the west than during the other monsoon.\r\n\r\n_The climate of Galle_, as already stated, resembles in its general\r\ncharacteristics that of Colombo, but, being further to the south, and\r\nmore equally exposed to the influence of both the monsoons, the\r\ntemperature is not quite so high; and, during the cold season, it falls\r\nsome degrees lower, especially in the evening and early morning.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: At Point-de-Galle, in 1854, the number of rainy days was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n             Days.\r\nJanuary       12\r\nFebruary       7\r\nMarch         16\r\nApril         12\r\nMay           23\r\nJune          18\r\nJuly          11\r\nAugust        21\r\nSeptember     16\r\nOctober       20\r\nNovember      15\r\nDecember      13]\r\n\r\n_Kandy_, from its position, shares in the climate of the western coast;\r\nbut, from the frequency of the mountain showers, and its situation, at\r\nan elevation of upwards of sixteen hundred feet above the level of the\r\nsea, it enjoys a much cooler temperature. It differs from the low\r\ncountry in one particular, which is very striking--the early period of\r\nthe day at which the maximum heat is attained. This at Colombo is\r\ngenerally between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, whereas at\r\nKandy the thermometer shows the highest temperature of the day between\r\nten and eleven o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nIn the low country, ingenuity has devised so many expedients for defence\r\nfrom the excessive heat of the forenoon, that the languor it induces is\r\nchiefly experienced after sunset, and the coolness of the night is\r\ninsufficient to compensate for the exhaustion of the day; but, in Kandy,\r\nthe nights are so cool that it is seldom that warm covering can be\r\naltogether dispensed with. In the colder months, the daily range of the\r\nthermometer is considerable--approaching 30°; in the others, it differs\r\nlittle from 15°. The average mean, however, of each month throughout the\r\nyear is nearly identical, deviating only a degree from 76°, the mean\r\nannual temperature.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The following Table appeared in the _Colombo Observer_, and\r\nis valuable from the care taken by Mr. Caley in its preparation;\r\n\r\n_Analysis of the Climate at Peradenia, from 1851 to 1858 inclusive._\r\n\r\n|Months.    |     Temperature.     |  Rainfall. |      Remarks.           |\r\n|           |     |    |     |Aver-|    |Average|                         |\r\n|           |Max. |Min.|Mean.|age  | In.|of     |                         |\r\n|           |     |    |     | of  |    |Years /                          |\r\n|           |     |    |     |Years|     \\    /                           |\r\n|January    |85.0 |52.5|74.06|6    |4.04  |6 |Fine, sunny, heavy dew at   |\r\n|           |     |    |     |     |      |  |night, hot days, and cold   |\r\n|           |     |    |     |     |      |  |nights and mornings.        |\r\n|February   |87.75|55.0|75.76|7    |1.625 |6 |Fine, sunny, dewy nights,   |\r\n|           |     |    |     |     |      |  |foggy mornings, days hot,   |\r\n|           |     |    |     |     |      |  |nights and mornings cold.   |\r\n|March      |89.5 |59.5|77.42|7    |3.669 |6 |Generally a very hot and    |\r\n|           |     |    |     |     |      |  |oppressive month.           |\r\n|April      |89.5 |67.5|77.91|7    |7.759 |6 |Showery, sultry, and        |\r\n|           |     |    |     |     |      |  |   oppressive weather.      |\r\n|May        |88.0 |66.0|77.7 |8    |8.022 |6 |Cloudy, windy, rainy;       |\r\n                                             |  monsoon generally changes.|\r\n|June       |86.0 |71.0|76.69|8    |7.155 |6 |A very wet and stormy month.|\r\n|July       |86.0 |67.0|75.64|8    |5.72  |6 |Ditto           ditto       |\r\n|August     |85.5 |67.0|75.81|8    |8.55  |6 |Showery, but sometimes more |\r\n|           |     |    |     |     |      |  |moderate, variable          |\r\n|September  |85.5 |67.0|76.13|8    |6.318 |6 |Pretty dry weather, compared|\r\n|           |     |    |     |     |      |  |with the next two months.   |\r\n|October    |85.73|68.2|75.1 |8    |15.46 |6 |Wind variable, much rain.   |\r\n|November   |84.0 |62.0|74.79|8    |14.732|6 |Wind variable, storms from  |\r\n|           |     |    |     |     |      |  |all points of compass, wet; |\r\n|           |     |    |     |     |      |  |monsoon generally changes.  |\r\n|December   |82.75|57.0|74.05|7    |7.72  |5 |Sometimes wet, but generally|\r\n|           |     |    |     |     |      |  |more moderate; towards      |\r\n|           |     |    |     |     |      |  |end of year like January    |\r\n|           |     |    |     |     |      |  |weather.                    |\r\n\r\n      Mean yearly Temperature,  Mean yearly          Nov. 29, 1858\r\n      75.92º                    Rainfall, 91.75          J.A.

It greatly\r\nadds to the chilliness of travelling before dawn; but, generally\r\nspeaking, it is not wetting, as it is charged with the same electricity\r\nas the surface of the earth and the human body. When seen from the\r\nheights, it is a singular object, as it lies compact and white as snow\r\nin the hollows beneath, but it is soon put in motion by the morning\r\ncurrents, and wafted in the direction of the coast, where it is\r\ndissipated by the sunbeams.\r\n\r\n_Snow_ is unknown in Ceylon; _Hail_ occasionally falls in the Kandyan\r\nhills at the change of the monsoon,[1] but more frequently during that\r\nfrom the north-east. As observed at Kornegalle, the clouds, after\r\ncollecting as usual for a few evenings, and gradually becoming more\r\ndense, advanced in a wedge-like form, with a well-defined outline. The\r\nfirst fall of rain was preceded by a downward blast of cold air,\r\naccompanied by hailstones which outstripped the rain in their descent.\r\nRain and hail then poured down together, and, eventually, the latter\r\nonly spread its deluge far and wide, In 1852, the hail which thus fell\r\nat Kornegalle was of such a size that half-a-dozen lumps filled a\r\ntumbler, In shape, they were oval and compressed, but the mass appeared\r\nto have formed an hexagonal pyramid, the base of which was two inches in\r\ndiameter, and about half-an-inch thick, gradually thinning towards the\r\nedge. They were tolerably solid internally, each containing about the\r\nsize of a pea of clear ice at the centre, but the sides and angles were\r\nspongy and flocculent, as if the particles had been driven together by\r\nthe force of the wind, and had coalesced at the instant of contact. A\r\nphenomenon so striking as the fall of ice, at the moment of the most\r\nintense atmospherical heat, naturally attracts the wonder of the\r\nnatives, who hasten to collect the pieces, and preserve them, when\r\ndissolved, in bottles, from a belief in their medicinal properties. Mr.\r\nMorris, who has repeatedly observed hailstones in the Seven Korles, is\r\nunder the impression that their occurrence always happens at the first\r\noutburst of the monsoon, and that they fall at the moment, which is\r\nmarked by the first flash of lightning.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is stated in the _Physical Atlas_ of KEITH JOHNSTON,\r\nthat hail in India has not been noticed south of Madras. But in Ceylon\r\nit has fallen very recently at Korngalle, at Badulla, at Kaduganawa; and\r\nI have heard of a hail storm at Jaffna.  On 1 the 24th of Sept. 1857,\r\nduring a thunder-storm, hail fell near Matelle in such quantity that in\r\nplaces it formed drifts upwards of a foot in depth.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Stevelly, of Belfast, the rationale of their\r\nappearance on such occasions seems to be that, on the sudden formation\r\nand descent of the first drops, the air expanding and rushing into the\r\nvoid spaces, robs the succeeding drops of their caloric so effectually\r\nas to send them to the earth frozen into ice-balls.\r\n\r\nThese descriptions, it will be observed, apply exclusively to the\r\nsouthern regions on the east and west of Ceylon; and, in many\r\nparticulars, they are inapplicable to the northern portions of the\r\nisland. At Trincomalie, the climate bears a general resemblance to that\r\nof the Indian peninsula south of Madras: showers are frequent, but\r\nlight, and the rain throughout the year does not exceed forty inches.\r\nWith moist winds and plentiful dew, this sustains a vigorous vegetation\r\nnear the coast; but in the interior it would be insufficient for the\r\nculture of grain, were not the water husbanded in tanks; and, for this\r\nreason, the bulk of the population are settled along the banks of the\r\ngreat rivers.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of this part of Ceylon follows the course of the sun,\r\nand ranges from a minimum of 70° in December and January, to a maximum\r\nof 94° in May and June; but the heat is rendered tolerable at all\r\nseasons by the steadiness of the land and sea breezes.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The following facts regarding the climate of Trincomalie\r\nhave been, arranged from elaborate returns furnished by Mr. Higgs, the\r\nmaster-attendant of the port, and published under the authority of the\r\nmeteorological department of the Board of Trade:--\r\n\r\n_Trincomalie_.\r\n\r\n                                |Extreme\r\n     |Mean        |Mean         |Range    |Highest    |Days\r\n1854 |Maximum     |Minimum      |for the  |Temperature|of\r\n     |Temperature |Temperature  |Month    |Noted      |Rain\r\nJan. |  81.3°     | 74.7°       | 14°     | 83        | 10\r\nFeb. |  83.8      | 75.8        | 14      | 86        |  7\r\nMar. |  85.9      | 76.1        | 16      | 88        |  3\r\nApril|  89.6      | 78.9        | 16      | 92        |  3\r\nMay  |  89.1      | 79.3        | 19      | 93        |  3\r\nJune |  90.0      | 79.5        | 19      | 94        |  3\r\nJuly |  87.7      | 77.7        | 16      | 90        |  5\r\nAug. |  87.9      | 77.4        | 16      | 91        |  4\r\nSept.|  89.3      | 77.8        | 18      | 93        |  2\r\nOct. |  85.2      | 75.8        | 15      | 89        | 14\r\nNov. |  81.O      | 74.9        | 11      | 83        | 15\r\nDec. |  80.1      | 74.3        | 11      | 82        | 15\r\nMean temperature for the year 81.4.]\r\n\r\nIn the extreme north of the island, the peninsula of Jaffna, and the\r\nvast plains of Neura-kalawa and the Wanny, form a third climatic\r\ndivision, which, from the geological structure and peculiar\r\nconfiguration of the district, differs essentially from the rest of\r\nCeylon. This region, which is destitute of mountains, is undulating in a\r\nvery slight degree; the dry and parching north-east wind desiccates the\r\nsoil in its passage, and the sandy plains are covered with a low and\r\nscanty vegetation, chiefly fed by the night dews and whatever moisture\r\nis brought by the on-shore wind. The total rain of the year does not\r\nexceed thirty inches; and the inhabitants live in frequent apprehension\r\nof droughts and famines. These conditions attain their utmost\r\nmanifestation at the extreme north and in the Jaffna peninsula: there\r\nthe temperature is the highest[1] in the island, and, owing to the\r\nhumidity of the situation and the total absence of hills, it is but\r\nlittle affected by the changes of the monsoons; and the thermometer\r\nkeeps a regulated pace with the progress of the sun to and from the\r\nsolstices. The soil, except in particular spots, is porous and sandy,\r\nformed from the detritus of the coral rocks which it overlays. It is\r\nsubject to droughts sometimes of a whole year's continuance; and rain,\r\nwhen it falls, is so speedily absorbed, that it renders but slight\r\nservice to cultivation, which is entirely carried on by means of tanks\r\nand artificial irrigation, in the practice of which the Tamil population\r\nof this district exhibits singular perseverance and ingenuity.[2] In the\r\ndry season, when scarcely any verdure is discernible above ground, the\r\nsheep and goats feed on their knees--scraping away the sand, in order to\r\nreach the wiry and succulent roots of the grasses. From the constancy of\r\nthis practice horny callosities are produced, by which these hardy\r\ncreatures may be distinguished.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The mean lowest temperature at Jaffna is 70º, the mean\r\nhighest 90º; but in 1845-6 the thermometer rose to 90º and 100º.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For an account of the Jaffna wells, and the theory of their\r\nsupply with fresh water, see ch. i. p. 21.]\r\n\r\nWater-spouts are frequent on the coast of Ceylon, owing to the different\r\ntemperature of the currents of air passing across the heated earth and\r\nthe cooler sea, but instances are very rare of their bursting over land,\r\nor of accidents in consequence.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: CAMOENS, who had opportunities of observing the phenomena\r\nof these seas during his service on board the fleet of Cabral, off the\r\ncoast of Malabar and Ceylon, has introduced into the _Lusiad_ the\r\nepisode of a water-spout in the Indian Ocean; but, under the belief that\r\nthe water which descends had been previously drawn up by suction from\r\nthe ocean, he exclaims:--\r\n\r\n  \"But say, ye sages, who can weigh the cause,\r\n  And trace the secret springs of Nature's laws;\r\n  Say why the wave, of bitter brine erewhile,\r\n  Should be the bosom of the deep recoil,\r\n  Robbed of its salt, and from the cloud distil,\r\n  Sweet as the waters of the limpid rill?\"\r\n\r\n(Book v.)\r\n\r\nBut the truth appears to be that the torrent which descends from a\r\nwater-spout, is but the condensed accumulation of its own vapour, and,\r\nthough in the hollow of the lower cone which rests upon the surface of\r\nthe sea, salt water may possibly ascend in the partial vacuum caused by\r\nrevolution; or spray may be caught up and collected by the wind, still\r\nthese cannot be raised by it beyond a very limited height, and what\r\nCamoens saw descend was, as he truly says, the sweet water distilled\r\nfrom the cloud.]\r\n\r\nA curious phenomenon, to which the name of \"anthelia\" has been given,\r\nand which may probably have suggested to the early painters the idea of\r\nthe glory surrounding the heads of beatified saints, is to be seen in\r\nsingular beauty, at early morning, in Ceylon. When the light is intense,\r\nand the shadows proportionally dark--when the sun is near the horizon,\r\nand the shadow of a person walking is thrown on the dewy grass--each\r\nparticle of dew furnishes a double reflection from its concave and\r\nconvex surfaces; and to the spectator his own figure, but more\r\nparticularly the head, appears surrounded by a halo as vivid as if\r\nradiated from diamonds.[1] The Buddhists may possibly have taken from\r\nthis beautiful object their idea of the _agni_ or emblem of the sun,\r\nwith which the head of Buddha is surmounted. But unable to express a\r\n_halo_ in sculpture, they concentrated it into a _flame_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: SCORESBY describes the occurrence of a similar phenomenon\r\nin the Arctic Seas in July, 1813, the luminous circle being produced on\r\nthe particles of fog which rested on the calm water. \"The lower part of\r\nthe circle descended beneath my feet to the side of the ship, and\r\nalthough it could not be a hundred feet from the eye, it was perfect,\r\nand the colours distinct. The centre of the coloured circle was\r\ndistinguished by my own shadow, the head of which, enveloped by a halo,\r\nwas most conspicuously pourtrayed. The halo or glory evidently impressed\r\non the fog, but the figure appeared to be a shadow on the water; the\r\ndifferent parts became obscure in proportion to their remoteness from\r\nthe head, so that the lower extremities were not perceptible.\"--_Account\r\nof the Arctic Regions_, vol. i. ch. v. sec. vi. p. 394. A similar\r\nphenomenon occurs in the Khasia Hills, in the north-east of\r\nBengal.--_Asiat. Soc. Journ. Beng._ vol. xiii. p. 616.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ANTHELIA AS IT APPEARS TO THE PERSON HIMSELF]\r\n\r\nAnother luminous phenomenon which sometimes appears in the hill country,\r\nconsists of beams of light, which intersect the sky, whilst the sun is\r\nyet in the ascendant; sometimes horizontally, accompanied by\r\nintermitting movements, and sometimes vertically, a broad belt of the\r\nblue sky interposing between them.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: VIGNE mentions an appearance of this kind in the valley of\r\nKashmir: \"Whilst the rest of the horizon was glowing golden over the\r\nmountain tops, a broad well-defined ray-shaped streak of indigo was\r\nshooting upwards in the zenith: it remained nearly stationary about an\r\nhour, and was then blended into the sky around it, and disappeared with\r\nthe day. It was, no doubt, owing to the presence of some particular\r\nmountains which intercepted the red rays, and threw a blue shadow, by\r\ncausing so much of the sky above Kashmir to remain unaffected by\r\nthem.\"--_Travels in Kashmir_, vol. ii. ch. x. p. 115.]\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon this is doubtless owing to the air holding in suspension a\r\nlarge quantity of vapour, which receives shadows and reflects rays of\r\nlight. The natives, who designate them \"Buddha's rays,\" attach a\r\nsuperstitious dread to their appearance, and believe them to be\r\nportentous of misfortune--in every month, with the exception of _May_,\r\nwhich, for some unexplained reason, is exempted.\r\n\r\nHEALTH.--In connection with the subject of \"Climate,\" one of the most\r\nimportant inquiries is the probable effect on the health and\r\nconstitution of a European produced by a prolonged exposure to an\r\nunvarying temperature, upwards of 30 degrees higher than the average of\r\nGreat Britain. But to this the most tranquillising reply is the\r\nassurance that _mere heat, even to a degree beyond that of Ceylon, is\r\nnot unhealthy in itself_. Aden, enclosed in a crater of an extinct\r\nvolcano, is not considered insalubrious; and the hot season in India,\r\nwhen the thermometer stands at 100° at midnight, is comparatively a\r\nhealthy period of the year. In fact, in numerous cases heat may be the\r\nmeans of removing the immediate sources of disease. Its first\r\nperceptible effect is a slight increase, of the normal bodily\r\ntemperature beyond 98°, and, simultaneously, an increased activity of\r\nall the vital functions. To this everything contributes an exciting\r\nsympathy--the glad surprise of the natural scenery, the luxury of\r\nverdure, the tempting novelty of fruits and food, and all the\r\nunaccustomed attractions of a tropical home. Under these combined\r\ninfluences the nervous sensibility is considerably excited, and the\r\ncirculation acquires greater velocity, with somewhat diminished force.\r\nThis is soon followed, however, by the disagreeable evidences of the\r\neffort made by the system to accommodate itself to the new atmospheric\r\ncondition. The skin often becomes fretted by \"prickly heat,\" or\r\ntormented by a profusion of boils, but relief being speedily obtained\r\nthrough these resources, the new comer is seldom afterwards annoyed by a\r\nrecurrence of the process, unless under circumstances of impaired tone,\r\nthe result of weakened digestion or climatic derangement.\r\n\r\n_Malaria_.--Compared with Bengal and the Dekkan, the climate of Ceylon\r\npresents a striking superiority in mildness and exemption from all the\r\nextremes of atmospheric disturbance; and, except in particular\r\nlocalities, all of which are well known and avoided[1], from being\r\nliable after the rains to malaria, or infested at particular seasons\r\nwith agues and fever, a lengthened residence in the island may be\r\ncontemplated, without the slightest apprehension of prejudicial results.\r\nThese pestilential localities are chiefly at the foot of mountains, and,\r\nstrange to say, in the vicinity of some active rivers, whilst the vast\r\nlevel plains, whose stagnant waters are made available for the\r\ncultivation of rice, are seldom or never productive of disease. It is\r\neven believed that the deadly air is deprived of its poison in passing\r\nover an expanse of still water; and one of the most remarkable\r\ncircumstances is, that the points fronting the aerial currents are those\r\nexposed to danger, whilst projecting cliffs, belts of forest, and even\r\nmoderately high walls, serve to protect all behind them from attack.[2]\r\nIn traversing districts suspected of malaria, experience has dictated\r\ncertain precautions, which, with ordinary prudence and firmness, serve\r\nto neutralise the risk--retiring punctually at sunset, generous diet,\r\nmoderate stimulants, and the daily use of quinine both before and after\r\nexposure. These, and the precaution, at whatever sacrifice of comfort,\r\nto sleep under mosquito curtains, have been proved in long journeys to\r\nbe valuable prophylactics against fever and the pestilence of the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Notwithstanding this general condition, fevers of a very\r\nserious kind have been occasionally known to attack persons on the\r\ncoast, who had never exposed themselves to the miasma of the jungle.\r\nSuch instances have occurred at Galle, and more rarely at Colombo. The\r\ncharacteristics of places in this regard have, in some instances,\r\nchanged unaccountably; thus at Persadenia, close to Kandy, it was at one\r\ntime regarded as dangerous to sleep.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Generally speaking, a flat open country is healthy, either\r\nwhen flooded deeply by rains, or when dried to hardness by the sun; but\r\nin the process of dessication, its exhalations are perilous. The wooded\r\nslopes at the base of mountains are notorious for fevers; such as the\r\n_terrai_ of the Nepal hills, the Wynaad jungle, at the foot of the\r\nGhauts, and the eastern side of the mountains of Ceylon.]\r\n\r\n_Food_.--Always bearing in mind that of the quantity of food habitually\r\ntaken in a temperate climate, a certain proportion is consumed to\r\nsustain the animal heat, it is obvious that in the glow of the tropics,\r\nwhere the heat is already in excess, this portion of the ingesta not\r\nonly becomes superfluous so far as this office is concerned, but\r\noccasions disturbance of the other functions both of digestion and\r\nelimination. Over-indulgence in food, equally with intemperance in wine,\r\nis one fruitful source of disease amongst Europeans in Ceylon; and\r\nmaladies and mortality are often the result of the former, in patients\r\nwho would repel as an insult the imputation of the latter.\r\n\r\nSo well have national habits conformed to instinctive promptings in this\r\nregard, that the natives of hot countries have unconsciously sought to\r\nheighten the enjoyment of food by taking their principal repast _after\r\nsunset_[1]; and the European in the East will speedily discover for\r\nhimself the prudence, not only of reducing the quantity, but in regard\r\nto the quality of his meals, of adopting those articles which nature has\r\nbountifully supplied as best suited to the climate. With a moderate use\r\nof flesh meat, vegetables, and especially farinaceous food, are chiefly\r\nto be commended.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The prohibition of swine, which has formed an item in the\r\ndietetic ritual of the Egyptians, the Hebrews, and Mahometans, has been\r\ndefended in all ages, from Manetho and Herodotus downwards, on the\r\nground that the flesh of an animal so foully fed has a tendency to\r\npromote cutaneous disorders, a belief which, though held as a fallacy in\r\nnorthern climates, may have a truthful basis in the East.--ÆLIAN, _Hist.\r\nAnim._ 1. X. 16. In a recent general order Lord Clyde has prohibited its\r\nuse in the Indian army. Camel's flesh, which is also declared unclean in\r\nLeviticus, is said to produce in the Arabs serious derangement of the\r\nstomach.]\r\n\r\nThe latter is rendered attractive by the unrivalled excellence of the\r\nSinghalese in the preparation of innumerable curries[1], each tempered\r\nby the delicate creamy juice expressed from the flesh of the coco-nut\r\nafter it has been reduced to a pulp. Nothing of the same class in India\r\ncan bear a comparison with the piquant delicacy of a curry in Ceylon,\r\ncomposed of fresh condiments and compounded by the skilful hand of a\r\nnative.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The popular error of thinking curry to be an invention of\r\nthe Portuguese in India is disproved by the mention in the _Rajavali_ of\r\nits use in Ceylon in the second century before the Christian era, and in\r\nthe _Mahawanso_ in the fifth century of it. This subject is mentioned\r\nelsewhere: see chapter on the Arts and Sciences of the Singhalese.]\r\n\r\n_The use of fruit_--Fruits are abundant and wholesome; but with the\r\nexception of oranges, pineapples, the luscious mango and the\r\nindescribable \"rambutan,\" for want of horticultural attention they are\r\ninferior in flavour, and soon cease to be alluring.\r\n\r\n_Wine_.--Wine has of late years become accessible to all, and has thus,\r\nin some degree, been substituted for brandy; the abuse of which at\r\nformer periods is commemorated in the records of those fearful disorders\r\nof the liver, derangements of the brain, exhausting fevers, and visceral\r\ndiseases, which characterise the medical annals of earlier times. With a\r\nfirm adherence to temperance in the enjoyment of stimulants, and\r\nmoderation in the pleasures of the table, with attention to exercise and\r\nfrequent resort to the bath, it may be confidently asserted that health\r\nin Ceylon is as capable of preservation and life as susceptible of\r\nenjoyment, as in any country within the tropics.\r\n\r\n_Exposure_.--Prudence and foresight are, however, as indispensable there\r\nas in any other climate to escape well-understood risks. Catarrhs and\r\nrheumatism are as likely to follow needless exposure to the withering\r\n\"along-shore wind\" of the winter months in Ceylon[1], as they are\r\ntraceable to unwisely confronting the east winds of March in Great\r\nBritain; and during the alternation, from the sluggish heat which\r\nprecedes the monsoon, to the moist and chill vapours that follow the\r\ndescent of the rains, intestinal disorders, fevers, and liver complaints\r\nare not more characteristic of an Indian monsoon than an English autumn,\r\nand are equally amenable to those precautions by which liability may be\r\ndiminished in either place.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See _ante_, p. 57. It is an agreeable characteristic of the\r\nclimate of Ceylon, that sun-stroke, which is so common even in the\r\nnorthern portions of India, is almost unknown in the island. Sportsmen\r\nare out all day long in the hottest weather, a practice which would be\r\nthought more than hazardous in Oude or the north-west provinces. Perhaps\r\nan explanation of this may be found in the difference in moisture in the\r\ntwo atmospheres, which may modify the degrees of evaporation; but the\r\ninquiry is a curious one. It is becoming better understood in the army\r\nthat active service, and even a moderate exposure to the solar rays\r\n(_always guarding them from the head_,) are conducive rather than\r\ninjurious to health in the tropics. The pale and sallow complexion of\r\nladies and children born in India, is ascribable in a certain degree to\r\nthe same process by which vegetables are blanched under shades which\r\nexclude the light:--they are reared in apartments too carefully kept\r\ndark.]\r\n\r\n_Paleness_.--At the same time it must be observed, that the pallid\r\ncomplexion peculiar to old residents, is not alone ascribable to an\r\norganic change in the skin from its being the medium of perpetual\r\nexudation, but in part to a deficiency of red globules in the blood, and\r\nmainly to a reduced vigour in the whole muscular apparatus, including\r\nthe action of the heart, which imperfectly compensates by increased\r\nrapidity for diminution of power. It is remarkable how suddenly this\r\nsallowness disappears, and is succeeded by the warm tints of health,\r\nafter a visit of a very few days to the plains of Neuera-ellia, or the\r\npicturesque coffee plantations in the hills that surround it.\r\n\r\n_Ladies_.--Ladies, from their more regular and moderate habits, and\r\ntheir avoidance of exposure, might be expected to withstand the climate\r\nbetter than men; and to a certain extent the anticipation appears to be\r\ncorrect, but it by no means justifies the assumption of general\r\nimmunity. Though less obnoxious to specific disease, debility and\r\ndelicacy are the frequent results of habitual seclusion and avoidance of\r\nthe solar light. These, added to more obvious causes of occasional\r\nillness, suggest the necessity of vigorous exertion and regular exercise\r\nas indispensable protectives.\r\n\r\nIf suitably clothed, and not injudiciously fed, children may remain in\r\nthe island till eight or ten years of age, when anxiety is excited by\r\nthe attenuation of the frame and the apparent absence of strength in\r\nproportion to development. These symptoms, the result of relaxed tone\r\nand defective nutrition, are to be remedied by change of climate either\r\nto the more lofty ranges of the mountains, or, more providently, to\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n_Effects on Europeans already Diseased_.--To persons already suffering\r\nfrom disease, the experiment of a residence in Ceylon is one of\r\nquestionable propriety. Those of a scrofulous diathesis need not\r\nconsider it hazardous, as experience does not show that in such there is\r\nany greater susceptibility to local or constitutional disorders, or that\r\nwhen these are present, there is greater difficulty in their removal.\r\n\r\nTo those threatened with consumption, the island may be supposed to\r\noffer some advantages in the equability of the temperature, and the\r\ncomparative quiescence of the lungs from reduced necessity for\r\nrespiratory effort. Besides, the choice of climates presented by Ceylon\r\nenables a patient, by the easy change of residence to a different\r\naltitude and temperature, avoiding the heats of one period and the dry\r\nwinds of another, to check to a great extent the predisposing causes\r\nlikely to lead to the development of tubercle. This, with attention to\r\nclothing and systematic exercise as preventives of active disease, may\r\nserve to restrain the further progress though it fail to eradicate the\r\ntendency to phthibis. But when already the formation of tubercle has\r\ntaken place to any considerable extent, and is accompanied by softening,\r\nthe morbid condition is not unlikely to advance with alarming celerity;\r\nand the only compensating circumstance is the diminution of apparent\r\nsuffering, ascribable to general languor, and the absence of the\r\nbronchial irritation occasioned by cold humid air.\r\n\r\n_Dyspepsia_.--Habitual dyspeptics, and those affected by hepatic\r\nobstructions, had better avoid a lengthened sojourn in Ceylon; but the\r\ntortures of rheumatism and gout, if they be not reduced, are certainly\r\npostponed for longer intervals than those conceded to the same sufferers\r\nin England. Gout, owing to the great cutaneous excretion, in most\r\ninstances totally disappears.\r\n\r\n_Precautions for Health_.--Next to attention to diet, health in Ceylon\r\nis mainly to be preserved by systematic exercise, and a costume adapted\r\nto the climate and its requirements. Paradoxical as it may sound, the\r\ngreat cause of disease in hot climates is _cold_. Nothing ought more\r\ncautiously to be watched and avoided than the chills produced by\r\ndraughts and dry winds; and a change of dress or position should be\r\ninstantly resorted to when the warning sensation of chilliness is\r\nperceived.\r\n\r\n_Exercise_.--The early morning ride, after a single cup of coffee and a\r\nbiscuit on rising, and the luxury of the bath before dressing for\r\nbreakfast, constitute the enjoyments of the forenoon; and a similar\r\nstroll on horseback, returning at sunset to repeat the bath[1]\r\npreparatory to the evening toilette, completes the hygienic discipline\r\nof the day. At night the introduction of the Indian punka into bed-rooms\r\nwould be valuable, a thin flannel coverlet being spread over the bed.\r\nNothing serves more effectually to break down an impaired constitution\r\nin the tropics than the want of timely and refreshing sleep.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Je me souviens que les deux premières années que je fus en\r\nce pais-là, j'eus deux maladies: _alors je pris la coütume de me bien\r\nlaver soir et matin_, et pendant 16 ans que j'y ay demeuré depuis, je\r\nn'ay pas senti le moindre mal.\"--RIBEYRO, _Hist. de l'Isle de Ceylan_,\r\nvol. v. ch. xix. p. 149.]\r\n\r\n_Dress_.--In the selection of dress experience has taught the\r\nsuperiority of calico to linen, the latter, when damp from the\r\nexhalation of the skin, causing a chill which is injurious, whilst the\r\nformer, from some peculiarity in its fibre, however moist it may become,\r\nnever imparts the same sensation of cold. The clothing best adapted to\r\nthe climate is that whose texture least excites the already profuse\r\nperspiration, and whose fashion presents the least impediment to its\r\nescape.[1] The discomfort of woollen has led to its avoidance as far as\r\npossible; but those who, in England, may have accustomed themselves to\r\nflannel, will find the advantage of persevering to wear it, provided it\r\nis so light as not to excite perspiration. So equipped for active\r\nexercise, exposure to the sun, however hot, may be regarded without\r\napprehension, provided the limbs are in motion and the body in ordinary\r\nhealth; but the instinct of all oriental races has taught the necessity\r\nof protecting the head, and European ingenuity has not failed to devise\r\nexpedients for this all-important object.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Man not being created an aquatic animal, his skin cannot\r\nwith impunity be exposed to perpetual moisture, whether directly applied\r\nor arising from perspiration retained by dress. The importance to health\r\nof keeping the skin _dry_ does not appear to have hitherto received due\r\nattention.\"--PICKERING, _Races of Man_, &c., ch. xliv.]\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it will be apparent that, compared with\r\ncontinental India, the securities for health in Ceylon are greatly in\r\nfavour of the island. As to the formidable diseases which are common to\r\nboth, their occurrence in either is characterised by the same appalling\r\nmanifestations: dysentery fastens, with all its fearful concomitants, on\r\nthe unwary and incautious; and cholera, with its dark horrors, sweeps\r\nmysteriously across neglected districts, exacting its hecatombs. But the\r\nvisitation and ravages of both are somewhat under control, and the\r\nexperience bequeathed by each gloomy visitation has added to the\r\nfacilities for checking its recurrence.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"It is worthy of remark, that although all the troops in\r\nCeylon have occasionally, but at rare intervals; suffered severely from\r\ncholera, the disease has in very few instances attacked the officers; or\r\nindeed Europeans in the same grade of life. This is one important\r\ndifference to be borne in mind when estimating the comparative risk of\r\nlife in India and Ceylon. It must be due to the difference in comforts\r\nand quarters, or more particularly to the exemption from night duty, by\r\nfar the most trying of the soldiers' hardships. The small mortality\r\namongst the officers of European regiments in Ceylon is very\r\nremarkable.\"--_Note_ by Dr. CAMERON, Army Med. Staff.]\r\n\r\nIn some of the disorders incidental to the climate, and the treatment of\r\nulcerations caused by the wounds of the mosquitoes and leeches, the\r\nnative Singhalese have a deservedly high reputation; but their practice,\r\nwhen it depends on specifics, is too empirical to be safely relied on;\r\nand their traditional skill, though boasting a well authenticated\r\nantiquity, achieves few triumphs in competition with the soberer\r\ndiscipline of European science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nVEGETATION.--TREES AND PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the luxuriant vegetation of Ceylon has at all times been the\r\ntheme of enthusiastic admiration, its flora does not probably exceed\r\n3000 phænogamic plants[1]; and notwithstanding that it has a number of\r\nendemic species, and a few genera, which are not found on the great\r\nIndian peninsula, still its botanical features may be described as those\r\ncharacteristic of the southern regions of Hindustan and the Dekkan. The\r\nresult of some recent experiments has, however, afforded a curious\r\nconfirmation of the opinion ventured by Dr. Gardner, that, regarding its\r\nbotany geographically, Ceylon exhibits more of the Malayan flora and\r\nthat of the Eastern Archipelago, than of any portion of India to the\r\nwest of it. Two plants peculiar to Malacca, the nutmeg and the\r\nmangustin, have been attempted, but unsuccessfully, to be cultivated in\r\nBengal; but in Ceylon the former has been reared near Colombo with such\r\nsingular success that its produce now begins to figure in the exports of\r\nthe island;--and mangustins, which, ten years ago, were exhibited as\r\ncuriosities from a single tree in the old Botanic Garden at Colombo, are\r\nfound to thrive readily, and they occasionally appear at table,\r\nrivalling in their wonderful delicacy of flavour those which have\r\nheretofore been regarded as peculiar to the Straits.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The prolific vegetation of the island is likely to cause\r\nexaggeration in the estimate of its variety. Dr. Gardner, shortly after\r\nhis appointment as superintendent of the Botanic Garden at Kandy, in\r\nwriting to Sir W. Hooker, conjectured that the Ceylon flora might extend\r\nto 4000 or 5000 species. But from a recent _Report_ of the present\r\ncurator, Mr. Thwaites, it appears that the indigenous phænogamic plants\r\ndiscovered up to August, 1856, was 2670; of which 2025 were\r\ndicotyledonous, and 644 monocotyledonous flowering plants, besides 247\r\nferns and lycopods. When it is considered that this is nearly double the\r\nindigenous flora of England, and little under _one thirtieth_ of the\r\nentire number of plants hitherto described over the world, the botanical\r\nrichness of Ceylon, in proportion to its area, must be regarded as equal\r\nto that of any portion of the globe.]\r\n\r\nUp to the present time the botany of Ceylon has been imperfectly\r\nsubmitted to scientific scrutiny. Linnæus, in 1747, prepared his _Flora\r\nZeylanica_, from specimens collected by Hermann, which had previously\r\nconstituted the materials of the _Thesaurus Zeylanicus_ of Burman and\r\nnow form part of the herbarium in the British Museum. A succession of\r\nindustrious explorers have been since engaged in following up the\r\ninvestigation[1]; but, with the exception of an imperfect and\r\nunsatisfactory catalogue by Moon, no enumeration of Ceylon plants has\r\nyet been published. Dr. Gardner had made some progress with a Singhalese\r\nFlora, when his death took place in 1849, an event which threw the task\r\non other hands, and has postponed its completion for years.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Amongst the collections of Ceylon plants deposited in the\r\nHookerian Herbarium, are those made by General and Mrs. Walker, by Major\r\nChampion (who left the island in 1848), and by Mr. Thwaites, who\r\nsucceeded Dr. Gardner in charge of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kandy.\r\nMoon, who had previously held that appointment, left extensive\r\ncollections in the herbarium at Peradenia which have been lately\r\nincreased by his successors; and Macrae, who was employed by the\r\nHorticultural Society of London, has enriched their museum with Ceylon\r\nplants. Some admirable letters of Mrs. Walker are printed in HOOKER'S\r\n_Companion to the Botanical Magazine_. They include an excellent account\r\nof the vegetation of Ceylon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Dr. Gardner, in 1848, drew up a short paper containing\r\n_Some Remarks on the Flora of Ceylon_, which was printed in the appendix\r\nto LEE'S _Translation of Ribeyro_: to this essay, and to his personal\r\ncommunications during frequent journeys, I am indebted for many facts\r\nincorporated in the following pages.]\r\n\r\nFrom the identity of position and climate, and the apparent similarity\r\nof soil between Ceylon and the southern extremity of the Indian\r\npeninsula, a corresponding agreement might be expected between their\r\nvegetable productions: and accordingly in its aspects and subdivisions\r\nCeylon participates in those distinctive features which the monsoons\r\nhave imparted respectively to the opposite shores of Hindustan. The\r\nwestern coast being exposed to the milder influence of the south-west\r\nwind, shows luxuriant vegetation, the result of its humid and temperate\r\nclimate; whilst the eastern, like Coromandel, has a comparatively dry\r\nand arid aspect, produced by the hot winds which blow for half the year.\r\nThe littoral vegetation of the seaborde exhibits little variation from\r\nthat common throughout the Eastern archipelago; but it wants the\r\n_Phoenix paludosa_[1], a dwarf date-palm, which literally covers the\r\nislands of the Sunderbunds at the delta of the Ganges. A dense growth of\r\nmangroves[2] occupies the shore, beneath whose overarching roots the\r\nripple of the sea washes unseen over the muddy beach.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Drs. HOOKER and THOMSON, in their _Introductory Essay to\r\nthe Flora of India_, speaking of Ceylon, state that the _Nipa fruticans_\r\n(another characteristic palm of the Gangetic delta) and _Cycads_ are\r\nalso wanting there, but both these exist (the former abundantly), though\r\nperhaps not alluded to in any work on Ceylon botany to which those\r\nauthors had access. In connection with this subject it may be mentioned,\r\nas a fact which is much to be regretted, that, although botanists have\r\nbeen appointed to the superintendence of the Botanic Gardens at Kandy,\r\ninformation regarding the vegetation of the island is scarcely\r\nobtainable without extreme trouble and reference to papers scattered\r\nthrough innumerable periodicals. That the majority of Ceylon plants are\r\nalready known to science is owing to the coincidence of their being also\r\nnatives of India, whence they have been described; but there has been no\r\nrecent attempt on the part of colonial or European botanists even to\r\nthrow into a useful form the already published descriptions of the\r\ncommoner plants of the island. Such a work would be the first step to a\r\nSinghalese Flora. The preparation of such a compendium would seem, to\r\nbelong to the duties of the colonial botanist, and as such it was an\r\nobject of especial solicitude to the late superintendent, Dr. Gardner.\r\nBut the heterogeneous duties imposed upon the person holding his office\r\n(the evils arising from which are elsewhere alluded to), have hitherto\r\nbeen insuperable obstacles to the attainment of this object, as they\r\nhave also been to the preparation of a systematic account of the general\r\nfeatures of Ceylon vegetation. Such a work is strongly felt to be a\r\ndesideratum by numbers of intelligent persons in Ceylon, who are not\r\naccomplished botanists, but who are anxious to acquire accurate ideas as\r\nto the aspects of the flora at different elevations, different seasons,\r\nand different quarters of the island; of the kinds of plants that\r\nchiefly contribute to the vegetation of the coasts, the plains, and\r\nmountains; of the general relations that subsist between them and the\r\nflora of the Carnatic, Malabar, and the Malay archipelago; and of the\r\nmore useful plants in science, arts, medicine, and commerce.\r\n\r\nTo render such a work (however elementary) at once accurate as well as\r\ninteresting, would require sound scientific knowledge; and, however\r\nskilfully and popularly written, there would still be portions somewhat\r\ndifficult of comprehension to the ordinary reader; but curiosity would\r\nbe stimulated by the very occurrence of difficulty, and thus an impulse\r\nmight be given to the acquisition of rudimentary botany, which would\r\neventually enable the inquirer to contribute his quota to the natural\r\nhistory of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nP.S. Since the foregoing was written, Mr. Thwaites has announced the\r\nearly publication of a new work on Ceylon plants, to be entitled\r\n_Enumeratio Plantarum Zeylaniæ: with Descriptions of the new and little\r\nknown genera and species_, and observations on their habits, uses, &c.\r\nIn the Identification of the species Mr. Thwaites is to be assisted by\r\nDr. Hooker, F.R.S.; and from their conjoint labours we may at last hope\r\nfor a production worthy of the subject.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Rhizophera Candelaria, Kandelia Rheedei, Bruguiera\r\ngymnorhiza.]\r\n\r\nRetiring from the strand, there are groups of _Sonneratia[1], Avicennia,\r\nHeritiera_, and _Pandanus_; the latter with a stem like a dwarf palm,\r\nround which the serrated leaves ascend in spiral convolutions till they\r\nterminate in a pendulous crown, from which drop the amber clusters of\r\nbeautiful but uneatable fruit, with a close resemblance in shape and\r\ncolour to that of the pineapple, from which, and from the peculiar\r\narrangement of the leaves, the plant has acquired its name of the\r\nScrew-pine.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: At a meeting of the Entomological Society in 1842, Dr.\r\nTempleton sent, for the use of the members, many thin slices of\r\nsubstance to replace cork-wood as a lining for insect cases and drawers.\r\nAlong with the soft wood he sent the following notice:--\"In this country\r\n(he writes from Colombo, Ceylon, May 19, 1842), along the marshy banks\r\nof the large rivers, grows a very large handsome tree, named _Sonneratia\r\nacida_, by the younger Linnæus: its roots spread far and wide through\r\nthe soft moist earth, and at various distances along send up most\r\nextraordinary long spindle-shaped excrescences four or five feet above\r\nthe surface. Of these Sir James Edward Smith remarks 'what these\r\nhorn-shaped excrescences are which occupy the soil at some distance from\r\nthe base of the tree from a span to a foot in length and of a corky\r\nsubstance, as described by Rumphins, we can offer no conjecture.' Most\r\ncurious things (remarks Dr. Templeton) they are; they all spring very\r\nnarrow from the root, expand as they rise, and then become gradually\r\nattenuated, occasionally forking, but never throwing out shoots or\r\nleaves, or in any respect resembling the parent root or wood. They are\r\nfirm and close in their texture, nearly devoid of fibrous structure, and\r\ntake a moderate polish when cut with a sharp instrument; but for lining\r\ninsect boxes and making setting-boards they have no equal in the world.\r\nThe finest pin passes in with delightful ease and smoothness, and is\r\nheld firmly and tightly so that there is no risk of the insects becoming\r\ndisengaged. With a fine saw I form them into little boards and then\r\nsmooth them with a sharp case knife, but the London veneering-mills\r\nwould turn them out fit for immediate use, without any necessity for\r\nmore than a touch of fine glass-paper. Some of my pigmy boards are two\r\nfeet long by three and a half inches wide, which is more than sufficient\r\nfor our purpose, and to me they have proved a vast acquisition. The\r\nnatives call them 'Kirilimow,' the latter syllable signifying\r\nroot\"--TEMPLETON, _Trans. Ent. Soc._ vol. iii. p. 302.]\r\n\r\nA little further inland, the sandy plains are covered by a thorny\r\njungle, the plants of which are the same as those of the Carnatic, the\r\nclimate being alike; and wherever man has encroached on the solitude,\r\ngroves of coco-nut palms mark the vicinity of his habitations.\r\n\r\nRemote from the sea, the level country of the north has a flora almost\r\nidentical with that of Coromandel; but the arid nature of the Ceylon\r\nsoil, and its drier atmosphere, is attested by the greater proportion of\r\neuphorbias and fleshy shrubs, as well as by the wiry and stunted nature\r\nof the trees, their smaller leaves and thorny stems and branches.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. Gardner.]\r\n\r\nConspicuous amongst them are acacias of many kinds; _Cassia fistula_ the\r\nwood apple (_Feronia elephantum_), and the mustard tree of Scripture\r\n(_Salvadora Persica_), which extends from Ceylon to the Holy Land. The\r\nmargosa (_Azadirachta Indica_), the satin wood, the Ceylon oak, and the\r\ntamarind and ebony, are examples of the larger trees; and in the extreme\r\nnorth and west the Palmyra palm takes the place of the coco-nut, and not\r\nonly lines the shore, but fills the landscape on every side with its\r\nshady and prolific groves.\r\n\r\nProceeding southward on the western coast, the acacias disappear, and\r\nthe greater profusion of vegetation, the taller growth of the timber,\r\nand the darker tinge of the foliage, all attest the influence of the\r\nincreased moisture both from the rivers and the rains. The brilliant\r\n_Ixoras, Erythrinas, Buteas, Jonesias, Hibiscus_, and a variety of\r\nflowering shrubs of similar beauty, enliven the forests with their\r\nsplendour; and the seeds of the cinnamon, carried by the birds from the\r\ncultivated gardens near the coasts, have germinated in the sandy soil,\r\nand diversify the woods with the fresh verdure of its polished leaves\r\nand delicately-tinted shoots. It is to be found universally to a\r\nconsiderable height in the lower range of hills, and thither the Chalias\r\nwere accustomed to resort to cut and peel it, a task which was imposed\r\non them as a feudal service by the native sovereign, who paid an annual\r\ntribute in prepared cinnamon to the Dutch, and to the present time this\r\nbranch of the trade in the article continues, but divested of its\r\ncompulsory character.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch, in like manner, maintained, during the entire period of their\r\nrule, an extensive commerce in pepper worts, which still festoon the\r\nforest, but the export has almost ceased from Ceylon. Along with these\r\nthe trunks of the larger trees are profusely covered with other delicate\r\ncreepers, chiefly Convolvuli and Ipomoeas; and the pitcher-plant\r\n(_Nepenthes distillatoria_) lures the passer-by to halt and conjecture\r\nthe probable uses of the curious mechanism, by means of which it distils\r\na quantity of limpid fluid into the vegetable vases at the extremity of\r\nits leaves. The Orchideæ suspend their pendulous flowers from the angles\r\nof branches, whilst the bare roots and the lower part of the stem are\r\noccasionally covered with fungi of the most gaudy colours, bright red,\r\nyellow, and purple.\r\n\r\nOf the east side of the island the botany has never yet been examined by\r\nany scientific resident, but the productions of the hill country have\r\nbeen largely explored, and present features altogether distinct from\r\nthose of the plains. For the first two or three thousand feet the\r\ndissimilarity is less perceptible to an unscientific eye, but as we\r\nascend, the difference becomes apparent in the larger size of the\r\nleaves, and the nearly uniform colour of the foliage, except where the\r\nscarlet shoots of the ironwood tree (_Mesua ferrea_) seem, like flowers\r\nin their blood-red hue. Here the broad leaves of the wild plantains\r\n(_Musa textilis_) penetrate the soil among the broken rocks; and in\r\nmoist spots the graceful bamboo flourishes in groups, whose feathery\r\nfoliage waves like the plumes of the ostrich.[1] It is at these\r\nelevations that the sameness of the scenery is diversified by the grassy\r\npatenas before alluded to[2], which, in their aspect, though not their\r\nextent, may be called the Savannahs of Ceylon. Here peaches, cherries,\r\nand other European fruit trees, grow freely; but they become evergreens\r\nin this summer climate, and, exhausted by perennial excitement, and\r\ndeprived of their winter repose, they refuse to ripen their fruit.[3] A\r\nsimilar failure was discovered in some European vines, which were\r\ncultivated at Jaffna; but Mr. Dyke, the government agent, in whose\r\ngarden they grew, conceiving that the activity of the plants might be\r\nequally checked by exposing them to an extreme of warmth, as by\r\nsubjecting them to cold, tried, with perfect success, the experiment of\r\nlaying bare the roots in the strongest heat of the sun. The result\r\nverified his conjecture. The circulation of the sap was arrested, the\r\nvines obtained the needful repose, and the grapes, which before had\r\nfallen almost unformed from the tree, are now brought to thorough\r\nmaturity, though inferior in flavour to those produced at home.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the Malayan peninsula the bamboo has been converted into\r\nan instrument of natural music, by perforating it with holes through\r\nwhich the wind is permitted to sigh; and the effect is described as\r\nperfectly charming. Mr. Logan, who in 1847 visited Naning; contiguous to\r\nthe frontier of the European settlement of Malacca, on approaching the\r\nvillage of Kándáng, was surprised by hearing \"the most melodious sounds,\r\nsome soft and liquid like the notes of a flute, and others deep and full\r\nlike the tones of an organ. They were sometimes low, interrupted, or\r\neven single, and presently they would swell into a grand burst of\r\nmingled melody. On drawing near to a clump of trees; above the branches\r\nof which waved a slender bamboo about forty feet in length, he found\r\nthat the musical tones issued from it, and were caused by the breeze\r\npassing through perforations in the stem; the instrument thus formed is\r\ncalled by the natives the _bulu perindu_, or plaintive bamboo.\" Those\r\nwhich Mr. Logan saw had a slit in each joint, so that each stem\r\npossessed fourteen or twenty notes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See _ante_, p. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The apple-tree in the Peradenia Gardens seems not only to\r\nhave become an evergreen but to have changed its character in another\r\nparticular; for it is found to send out numerous runners under ground,\r\nwhich continually rise into small stems and form a growth of shrub-like\r\nplants around the parent tree.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: An equally successful experiment, to give the vine an\r\nartificial winter by baring the roots, is recorded by Mr. BALLARD, of\r\nBombay, in the _Transactions of the Agric. and Hortic. Society of\r\nIndia_, under date 24th May,1824. Calcutta. 1850. Vol. i. p. 96.]\r\n\r\nThe tea plant has been raised with complete success in the hills on the\r\nestate of the Messrs. Worms, at Rothschild, in Pusilawa[1]; but the want\r\nof any skilful manipulators to collect and prepare the leaves, renders\r\nit hopeless to attempt any experiment on a large scale, until assistance\r\ncan be secured from China, to conduct the preparation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The cultivation of tea was attempted by the Dutch, but\r\nwithout success.]\r\n\r\nStill ascending, at an elevation of 6500 feet, as we approach the\r\nmountain plateau of Neuera-ellia, the dimensions of the trees again\r\ndiminish, the stems and branches are covered with orchideæ and mosses,\r\nand around them spring up herbaceous plants and balsams, with here and\r\nthere broad expanses covered with _Acanthaceæ_, whose seeds are the\r\nfavourite food of the jungle fowl, which are always in perfection during\r\nthe ripening of the Nilloo.[1] It is in these regions that the\r\ntree-ferns (_Alsophila gigantea_) rise from the damp hollows, and carry\r\ntheir gracefully plumed heads sometimes to the height of twenty feet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There are said to be fourteen species of the Nilloo\r\n(_Strobilanthes_) in Ceylon. They form a complete under-growth in the\r\nforest five or six feet in height, and sometimes extending for miles.\r\nWhen in bloom, their red and blue flowers are a singularly beautiful\r\nfeature in the landscape, and are eagerly searched by the honey bees.\r\nSome species are said to flower only once in five, seven, or nine years;\r\nand after ripening their seed they die. This is one reason assigned for\r\nthe sudden appearance of the rats, which have been elsewhere alluded to\r\n(vol. i. p. 149, ii. p. 234) as invading the coffee estates, when\r\ndeprived of their ordinary food by the decay of the nilloo. It has been\r\nobserved that the jungle fowl, after feeding on the nilloo, have their\r\neyes so affected by it, as to be partially blinded, and permit\r\nthemselves to be taken by the hand. Are the seeds of this plant narcotic\r\nlike some of the _Solanaceaæ_? or do they cause dilatation of the pupil,\r\nlike those of the _Atropa Belladonna_?]\r\n\r\nAt length in the loftiest range of the hills the Rhododendrons are\r\ndiscovered; no longer delicate bushes, as in Europe, but timber trees of\r\nconsiderable height, and corresponding dimensions, and every branch\r\ncovered with a blaze of crimson flowers. In these forests are also to be\r\nmet with some species of _Michelia_, the Indian representatives of the\r\nMagnolias of North America, several arboreous _myrtaceæ_ and\r\n_ternstromiaceæ_, the most common of which is the camelia-like _Gordonia\r\nCeylanica_.[1] These and _Vaccinia, Gaultheria, Symploci, Goughia_, and\r\n_Gomphandra_, establish the affinity between the vegetation of this\r\nregion and that of the Malabar ranges, the Khasia and Lower Himalaya.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. Gardner.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Introduction to the Flora Indica_ of Dr. HOOKER and Dr.\r\nTHOMSON, p. 120. London, 1855.]\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the timber on the high mountains is of little value\r\nfor oeconomic purposes. Though of considerable dimensions, it is too\r\nunsubstantial to be serviceable for building or domestic uses; and\r\nperhaps, it may be regarded as an evidence of its perishable nature,\r\nthat dead timber is rarely to be seen in any quantity encumbering the\r\nground, in the heart of the deepest forests. It seems to go to dust\r\nalmost immediately after its fall, and although the process of\r\ndestruction is infinitely accelerated by the ravages of insects,\r\nespecially the white ants (_termites_) and beetles, which instantly\r\nseize on every fallen branch: still, one would expect that the harder\r\nwoods would, more or less, resist their attacks till natural\r\ndecomposition should have facilitated their operations and would thus\r\nexhibit more leisurely the progress of decay. But here decay is\r\ncomparatively instantaneous, and it is seldom that fallen timber is to\r\nbe found, except in the last stage of conversion into dust.\r\n\r\nSome of the trees in the higher ranges are remarkable for the prodigious\r\nheight to which they struggle upwards from the dense jungle towards the\r\nair and light; and one of the most curious of nature's devices, is the\r\nsingular expedient by which some families of these very tall and\r\ntop-heavy trees throw out buttresses like walls of wood, to support\r\nthemselves from beneath. Five or six of these buttresses project like\r\nrays from all sides of the trunk: they are from six to twelve inches\r\nthick, and advance from five to fifteen feet outward; and as they\r\nascend, gradually sink into the hole and disappear at the height of from\r\nten to twenty feet from the ground. By the firm resistance which they\r\noffer below, the trees are effectually steadied, and protected from the\r\nleverage of the crown, by which they would otherwise be uprooted. Some\r\nof these buttresses are so smooth and flat, as almost to resemble sawn\r\nplanks.\r\n\r\nThe greatest ornaments of the forest in these higher regions are the\r\nlarge flowering trees; the most striking of which is the Rhododendron,\r\nwhich in Ceylon forms a forest in the mountains, and when covered with\r\nflowers, it seems from a distance as though the hills were strewn with\r\nvermilion. This is the principal tree on the summit of Adam's Peak, and\r\ngrows to the foot of the rock on which rests the little temple that\r\ncovers the sacred footstep on its crest. Dr. Hooker states that the\r\nhoney of its flowers is believed to be poisonous in some parts of\r\nSikkim; but I never heard it so regarded in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nOne of the most magnificent of the flowering trees, is the coral\r\ntree[1], which is also the most familiar to Europeans, as the natives of\r\nthe low country and the coast, from the circumstance of its stem being\r\ncovered with thorns, plant it largely for fences, and grow it in the\r\nvicinity of their dwellings. It derives its English name from the\r\nresemblance which its scarlet flowers present to red coral, and as these\r\nclothe the branches before the leaves appear, their splendour attracts\r\nthe eye from a distance, especially when lighted by the full blaze of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Erythrina Indica_. It belongs to the pea tribe, and must\r\nnot be confounded with the _Jatropha multifida_ which has also acquired\r\nthe name of the _coral tree_. Its wood is so light and spongy, that it\r\nis used in Ceylon to form corks for preserve jars; and both there and at\r\nMadras the natives make from it models of their implements of husbandry,\r\nand of their sailing boats and canoes.]\r\n\r\nThe Murutu[1] is another flowering tree which may vie with the Coral,\r\nthe Rhododendron, or the Asoca, the favourite of Sanskrit poetry. It\r\ngrows to a considerable height, especially in damp places and the\r\nneighbourhood of streams, and pains have been taken, from appreciation\r\nof its attractions, to plant it by the road side and in other\r\nconspicuous positions. From the points of the branches panicles are\r\nproduced, two or three feet in length, composed of flowers, each the\r\nsize of a rose and of all shades, from a delicate pink to the deepest\r\npurple. It abounds in the south-west of the island.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Lagerstroemia Reginæ.]\r\n\r\nThe magnificent Asoca[1] is found in the interior, and is cultivated,\r\nthough not successfully, in the Peradenia Garden, and in that attached\r\nto Elie House at Colombo. But in Toompane, and in the valley of\r\nDoombera, its loveliness vindicates all the praises bestowed on it by\r\nthe poets of the East. Its orange and crimson flowers grow in graceful\r\nracemes, and the Singhalese, who have given the rhododendron the\r\npre-eminent appellation of the \"great red flower,\" (_maha-rat-mal_,)\r\nhave called the Asoca the _diya-rat-mal_ to indicate its partiality for\r\n\"moisture,\" combined with its prevailing hue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Jonesia Asoca.]\r\n\r\nBut the tree which will most frequently attract the eye of the\r\ntraveller, is the kattoo-imbul of the Singhalese[1], one of which\r\nproduces the silky cotton which, though incapable of being spun, owing\r\nto the shortness of its delicate fibre, makes the most luxurious\r\nstuffing for sofas and pillows. It is a tall tree covered with\r\nformidable thorns; and being deciduous, the fresh leaves, like those of\r\nthe coral tree, do not make their appearance till after the crimson\r\nflowers have covered the branches with their bright tulip-like petals.\r\nSo profuse are these gorgeous flowers, that when they fall, the ground\r\nfor many roods on all sides is a carpet of scarlet. They are succeeded\r\nby large oblong pods, in which the black polished seeds are deeply\r\nembedded in the floss which is so much prized by the natives. The trunk\r\nis of an unusually bright green colour, and the branches issue\r\nhorizontally from the stem, in whorls of threes with a distance of six\r\nor seven feet between each whorl.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Bombax Malabaricus_. As the genus Bombax is confined to\r\ntropical America, the German botanists, Schott and Endlicher, have\r\nassigned to the imbul its ancient Sanskrit name, and described it as\r\n_Salmalia Malabarica_.]\r\n\r\nNear every Buddhist temple the priests plant the Iron tree (_Messua\r\nferrea_)[1] for the sake of its flowers, with which they decorate the\r\nimages of Buddha. They resemble white roses, and form a singular\r\ncontrast with the buds and shoots of the tree, which are of the deepest\r\ncrimson. Along with its flowers the priests use likewise those of the\r\nChampac (_Michelia Champaca_), belonging to the family of magnoliaceæ.\r\nThey have a pale yellow tint, with the sweet oppressive perfume which is\r\ncelebrated in the poetry of the Hindus. From the wood of the champac the\r\nimages of Buddha are carved for the temples.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. Gardner supposed the ironwood tree of Ceylon to have\r\nbeen confounded with the _Messua ferrea_ of Linnæus. He asserted it to\r\nbe a distinct species, and assigned to it the well-known Singhalese name\r\n\"_nagaha_,\" or _iron-wood tree_. But this conjecture has since proved\r\nerroneous.]\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Upas tree of Java (_Antiaris toxicaria_) which has been\r\nthe subject of so many romances, exploded by Dr. Horsfield[1], was\r\nsupposed by Dr. Gardner to exist in Ceylon, but more recent scrutiny has\r\nshown that what he mistook for it, was an allied species, the _A.\r\nsaccidora_, which grows at Kornegalle, and in other parts of the island;\r\nand is scarcely less remarkable, though for very different\r\ncharacteristics. The Ceylon species was first brought to public notice\r\nby E. Rawdon Power, Esq., government agent of the Kandyan province, who\r\nsent specimens of it, and of the sacks which it furnishes, to the branch\r\nof the Asiatic Society at Colombo. It is known to the Singhalese by the\r\nname of \"ritigaha,\" and is identical with the _Lepurandra saccidora_,\r\nfrom which the natives of Coorg, like those of Ceylon, manufacture an\r\ningenious substitute for sacks by a process which is described by Mr.\r\nNimmo.[2] \"A branch is cut corresponding to the length and breadth of\r\nthe bag required, it is soaked and then beaten with clubs till the liber\r\nseparates from the timber. This done, the sack which is thus formed out\r\nof the bark is turned inside out, and drawn downwards to permit the wood\r\nto be sawn off, leaving a portion to form the bottom which is kept\r\nfirmly in its place by the natural attachment of the bark.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The vegetable poisons, the use of which is ascribed to the\r\nSinghalese, are chiefly the seeds of the _Datura_, which act as a\r\npowerful narcotic, and those of the _Croton tiglium_, the excessive\r\neffect of which ends in death. The root of the _Nerium odorum_ is\r\nequally fatal, as is likewise the exquisitely beautiful _Gloriosa\r\nsuperba_, whose brilliant flowers festoon the jungle in the plains of\r\nthe low country. See Bennett's account of the _Antiaris_, in HORSFIELD'S\r\n_Plantæ Javanicæ_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Catalogue of Bombay Plants, p. 193. The process in Ceylon\r\nis thus described in Sir W. HOOKER'S _Report on the Vegetable Products_\r\nexhibited in Paris in 1855: \"The trees chosen for the purpose measure\r\nabove a foot in diameter. The felled trunks are cut into lengths, and\r\nthe bark is well beaten with a stone or a club till the parenchymatous\r\npart comes off, leaving only the inner bark attached to the wood; which\r\nis thus easily drawn out by the hand. The bark thus obtained is fibrous\r\nand tough, resembling a woven fabric: it is sewn at one end into a sack,\r\nwhich is filled with sand, and dried in the sun.\"]\r\n\r\nAs we descend the hills the banyans[1] and a variety of figs make their\r\nappearance. They are the Thugs of the vegetable world, for although not\r\nnecessarily epiphytic, it may be said that in point of fact no single\r\nplant comes to perfection, or acquires even partial development, without\r\nthe destruction of some other on which to fix itself as its supporter.\r\nThe family generally make their first appearance as slender roots\r\nhanging from the crown or trunk of some other tree, generally a palm,\r\namong the moist bases of whose leaves the seed carried thither by some\r\nbird which had fed upon the fig, begins to germinate. This root\r\nbranching as it descends, envelopes the trunk of the supporting tree\r\nwith a network of wood, and at length penetrating the ground, attains\r\nthe dimensions of a stem. But unlike a _stem_ it throws out no buds,\r\nleaves, or flowers; the true stem, with its branches, its foliage, and\r\nfruit, springs upwards from the crown of the tree whence the root is\r\nseen descending; and from it issue the pendulous rootlets, which, on\r\nreaching the earth, fix themselves firmly and form the marvellous growth\r\nfor which the banyan is so celebrated.[2] In the depth of this grove,\r\nthe original tree is incarcerated till, literally strangled by the folds\r\nand weight of its resistless companion, it dies and leaves the fig in\r\nundisturbed possession of its place. It is not unusual in the forest to\r\nfind a fig-tree which had been thus upborne till it became a standard,\r\nnow forming a hollow cylinder, the centre of which was once filled by\r\nthe sustaining tree: but the empty walls form a circular network of\r\ninterlaced roots and branches; firmly agglutinated under pressure, and\r\nadmitting the light through interstices that look like loopholes in a\r\nturret.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Ficus Indica.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: I do not remember to have seen the following passage from\r\nPliny referred to as the original of Milton's description of this\r\nmarvellous tree:--\r\n\r\n\"Ipsa se serens, vastis diffunditur ramis: quorum imi adeo in terram\r\ncurvantur, ut annuo spatio infigantur, novamque sibi _propaginem faciant\r\ncirca parentem in orbem._ Intra septem eam _æstivant pastores_, opacam\r\npariter et munitam vallo arboris, decora specie subter intuenti,\r\nproculve, _fornicato_ arbore. Foliorum latitudo _peltæ effigiem\r\nAmazonicæ_ habet,\" &c.--PLINY, 1. xii. c. 11.\r\n\r\n  \"The fig-tree--not that kind for fruit renowned,\r\n  But such as at this day to Indians known,\r\n  In Malabar or Dekkan spreads her arms,\r\n  Branching so broad and long, that on the ground\r\n  The bended twigs take root, and _daughters grow\r\n  About the mother tree: a pillar'd_ shade\r\n  High over arched and echoing walks between.\r\n  There oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat,\r\n  Shelters in cool and _tends his pasturing flocks_\r\n  At loop-holes cut through thickest shade. These leaves\r\n  They gathered; broad as _Amazonian targe:_\r\n  And with what skill they had, together sewed\r\n  To gird their waist,\" &c.\r\n\r\n_Par. Lost_, ix. 1100.\r\n\r\nPliny's description is borrowed, with some embellishments, from\r\nTHEOPHRASTUS _de. Nat. Plant._ l. i. 7. iv. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARRIAGE OF THE FIG-TREE AND THE PALM.]\r\n\r\nAnother species of the same genus, _F. repens,_ is a fitting\r\nrepresentative of the English ivy, and is constantly to be seen\r\nclambering over rocks, turning through heaps of stones, or ascending\r\nsome tall tree to the height of thirty or forty feet, while the\r\nthickness of its own stem does not exceed a quarter of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe facility with which the seeds of the fig-tree take root where there\r\nis a sufficiency of moisture to permit of germination, has rendered them\r\nformidable assailants of the ancient monuments throughout Ceylon. The\r\nvast mounds of brickwork which constitute the remains of the Dagobas at\r\nAnarajapoora and Pollanarrua are covered densely with trees, among which\r\nthe figs are always conspicuous. One, which has fixed itself on the\r\nwalls of a ruined edifice at the latter city, forms one of the most\r\nremarkable objects of the place--its roots streaming downwards over the\r\nwalls as if their wood had once been fluid, follow every sinuosity of\r\nthe building and terraces till they reach the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FIG TREE ON THE RUINS OF POLLANARRUA.]\r\n\r\nTo this genus belongs the Sacred Bo-tree of the Buddhists, _Ficus\r\nreligiosa,_ which is planted close to every temple, and attracts almost\r\nas much veneration as the statue of the god himself. At Anarajapoora is\r\nstill preserved the identical tree said to have been planted 288 years\r\nbefore the Christian era.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For a memoir of this celebrated tree, see the account of\r\nAnarajapoora, Vol. II. p. 10.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the India-rubber tree (_F. elastica_) is not indigenous to\r\nCeylon, it is now very widely diffused over the island. It is remarkable\r\nfor the pink leathery covering which envelopes the leaves before\r\nexpansion, and for the delicate tracing of the nerves which run in\r\nequi-distant rows at right angles from the mid-rib. But its most\r\nstriking feature is the exposure of its roots, masses of which appear\r\nabove ground, extending on all sides from the base, and writhing over\r\nthe surface in undulations--\r\n\r\n  \"Like snakes in wild festoon,\r\n  In ramous wrestlings interlaced,\r\n  A forest Laocoon.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: HOOD's poem of _The Elm Tree._]\r\n\r\nSo strong, in fact, is the resemblance, that the villagers give it the\r\nname of the \"Snake-tree.\" One, which grows close to Cotta, at the Church\r\nMissionary establishment within a few miles of Colombo, affords a\r\nremarkable illustration of this peculiarity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SNAKE-TREE.]\r\n\r\nThere is an avenue of these trees leading to the Gardens of Peradenia,\r\nthe roots of which meet from either side of the road, and have so\r\ncovered the surface by their agglutinated reticulations as to form a\r\nwooden framework, the interstices of which retain the materials that\r\nform the roadway.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Ferguson of the Surveyor-General's Department, assures\r\nme that he once measured the root of a small wild fig-tree, growing in a\r\npatena at Hewahette, and found it upwards of 140 feet in length, whilst\r\nthe tree itself was not 30 feet high.]\r\n\r\nThe Kumbuk of the Singhalese (called by the Tamils Maratha-maram)[1] is\r\none of the noblest and most widely distributed trees in the island; it\r\ndelights in the banks of rivers and moist borders of tanks and canals;\r\nit overshadows the stream of the Mahawelli-ganga, almost from Kandy to\r\nthe sea; and it stretches its great arms above the still water of the\r\nlakes on the eastern side of the island.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pentaptera tomentosa _(Rox.)_.]\r\n\r\nOne venerable patriarch of this species, which grows at Mutwal, within\r\nthree miles of Colombo, towers to so great a height above the\r\nsurrounding forests of coconut palms, that it forms a landmark for the\r\nnative boatmen, and is discernible from Negombo, more than twenty miles\r\ndistant. The circumference of its stem, as measured by Mr. W. Ferguson,\r\nin 1850, was forty-five feet close to the earth, and seven yards at\r\ntwelve feet above the ground.\r\n\r\nThe timber, which is durable, is applied to the carving of idols for the\r\ntemples, besides being extensively used for less dignified purposes; but\r\nit is chiefly prized for the bark, which is sold as a medicine, and, in\r\naddition to yielding a black dye, it is so charged with calcareous\r\nmatter that its ashes, when burnt, afford a substitute for the lime\r\nwhich the natives chew with their betel.\r\n\r\nSome of the trees found in the forests of the interior are remarkable\r\nfor the curious forms in which they produce their seeds. One of these,\r\nwhich sometimes grows to the height of one hundred feet without throwing\r\nout a single branch, has been confounded with the durian of the Eastern\r\nArchipelago, or supposed to be an allied species[1], but it differs from\r\nit in the important particular that its fruit is not edible. The real\r\ndurian is not indigenous to Ceylon, but was brought there by the\r\nPortuguese in the sixteenth century.[2] It has been very recently\r\nre-introduced, and is now cultivated successfully. The native name for\r\nthe Singhalese tree, \"Katu-boeda,\" denotes the prickles that cover its\r\nfruit, which is as large as a coco-nut, and set with thorns each nearly\r\nan inch in length.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is the _Cullenia excelsa_ of WIGHT's _Icones, &c._\r\n(761-2).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: PORCACCHI, in his _Isolario_, written in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, enumerates the true durian as being then amongst the ordinary\r\nfruit of Ceylon.--\"Vi nasce anchora un frutto detto Duriano, verde et\r\ngrande come quei cocomeri, che a Venetia son chiamati angurie: in mezo\r\ndel quale trouano dentro cinque frutti de sapor molto excellente.\"--Lib.\r\niii. p. 188. Padua, A.D. 1619.]\r\n\r\nThe _Sterculia foetida,_ one of the finest and noblest of the Ceylon\r\nforest-trees, produces from the end of its branches large bunches of\r\ndark purple flowers of extreme richness and beauty; but emitting a\r\nstench so intolerable as richly to entitle it to its very characteristic\r\nbotanical name. The fruit is equally remarkable, and consists of several\r\ncrimson cases of the consistency of leather, within which are enclosed a\r\nnumber of black bean-like seeds: these are dispersed by the bursting of\r\ntheir envelope, which splits open to liberate them when sufficiently\r\nripened.\r\n\r\nThe Moodilla (_Barringtonia speciosa_) is another tree which attracts\r\nthe eye of the traveller, not less from the remarkably shaped fruit\r\nwhich it bears than from the contrast between its dark glossy leaves and\r\nthe delicate flowers which they surround. The latter are white, tipped\r\nwith crimson, but the petals drop off early, and the stamens, of which\r\nthere are nearly a hundred to each flower, when they fall to the ground\r\nmight almost be mistaken for painters' brushes. The tree (as its name\r\nimplies) loves the shore of the sea, and its large quadrangular fruits,\r\nof pyramidal form, being protected by a hard fibrous covering, are\r\ntossed by the waves till they root themselves on the beach. It grows\r\nfreely at the mouths of the principal rivers on the west coast, and\r\nseveral noble specimens of it are found near the fort of Colombo.\r\n\r\nThe Goda-kaduru, or _Strychnos nux-vomica_ is abundant in these\r\nprodigious forests, and has obtained an European celebrity on account of\r\nits producing the poisonous seeds from which strychnine is extracted.\r\nIts fruit, which it exhibits in great profusion, is of the size and\r\ncolour of a small orange, within which a pulpy substance envelopes the\r\nseeds that form the \"nux-vomica\" of commerce. It grows in great\r\nluxuriance in the vicinity of the ruined tanks throughout the Wanny, and\r\non the west coast as far south as Negombo. It is singular that in this\r\ngenus there should be found two plants, the seeds of one being not only\r\nharmless but wholesome, and that of the other the most formidable of\r\nknown poisons.[1] Amongst the Malabar immigrants there is a belief that\r\nthe seeds of the goda-kaduru, if habitually taken, will act as a\r\nprophylactic against the venom of the cobra de capello; and I have been\r\nassured that the coolies coming from the coast of India accustom\r\nthemselves to eat a single seed per day in order to acquire the desired\r\nprotection from the effects of this serpent's bite.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The _tettan-cotta,_ the use of which is described in Vol.\r\nII. Pt. ix. ch. i. p. 411, when applied by the natives to clarify muddy\r\nwater, is the seed of another species of strychnos, _S. potatorum_. The\r\nSinghalese name is _ingini_ (_tettan-cotta_ is Tamil).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In India, the distillers of arrack from the juice of the\r\ncoco-nut palm are said, by Roxburgh, to introduce the seeds of the\r\nstrychnus, in order to increase the intoxicating power of the spirit.]\r\n\r\nIn these forests the Euphorbia[1], which we are accustomed to see only\r\nas a cactus-like green-house plant, attains the size and strength of a\r\nsmall timber-tree; its quadrangular stem becomes circular and woody, and\r\nits square fleshy shoots take the form of branches, or rise with a\r\nrounded top as high as thirty feet.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: E. Antiquorun.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Amongst the remarkable plants of Ceylon, there is one\r\nconcerning which a singular error has been perpetuated in botanical\r\nworks from the time of Paul Hermann, who first described it in 1687, to\r\nthe present. I mean the _kiri-anguna_ (Gymnema lactiferum), evidently a\r\nform of the G. sylvestre, to which has been given the name of the\r\n_Ceylon cow-tree_; and it is asserted that the natives drink its juice\r\nas we do milk. LOUDON (_Ency. of Plants_, p. 197) says, \"The milk of the\r\n_G. lactiferum_ is used instead of the vaccine ichor, and the leaves are\r\nemployed in sauces in the room of cream.\" And LINDLEY, in his _Vegetable\r\nKingdom_, in speaking of the Asclepiads, says, \"the cow plant of Ceylon,\r\n'kiri-anguna,' yields a milk of which the Singhalese make use for food;\r\nand its leaves are also used when boiled.\" Even in the _English\r\nCyclopædia_ of CHARLES KNIGHT, published so lately as 1854, this error\r\nis repeated. (See art. Cow-tree, p. 178.) But this in altogether a\r\nmistake;--the Ceylon plant, like many others, has acquired its epithet\r\nof _kiri_, not from the juices being susceptible of being used as a\r\nsubstitute for milk, but simply from its resemblance to it in colour and\r\nconsistency. It is a creeper, found on the southern and western coasts,\r\nand used medicinally by the natives, but never as an article of food.\r\nThe leaves, when chopped and boiled, are administered to nurses by\r\nnative practitioners, and are supposed to increase the secretion of\r\nmilk. As to its use, as stated by London, in lieu of the vaccine matter,\r\nit is altogether erroneous. MOON, in his _Catalogue of the Plants of\r\nCeylon_, has accidentally mentioned the kiri-anguna twice, being misled\r\nby the Pali synonym \"kiri-hangula\": they are the same plant, though he\r\nhas inserted them as different, p. 21.]\r\n\r\nBut that which arrests the attention even of an indifferent passer-by is\r\nthe endless variety and almost inconceivable size and luxuriance of the\r\n_climbing plants and epiphytes_ which live upon the forest trees in\r\nevery part of the island. It is rare to see a single tree without its\r\nfamilies of dependents of this description, and on one occasion I\r\ncounted on a single prostrate stem no less than sixteen species of\r\nCapparis, Beaumontia, Bignonia, Ipomoea, and other genera, which, in its\r\nfall, it had brought along with it to the ground. Those which are free\r\nfrom climbing plants have their higher branches and hollows occupied by\r\nferns and orchids, of which latter the variety is endless in Ceylon,\r\nthough the beauty of their flower is not equal to those of Brazil and\r\nother tropical countries. In the many excursions which I made with Dr.\r\nGardner he added numerous species to those already known, including the\r\nexquisite _Saccolabium guttatum_, which we came upon in the vicinity of\r\nBintenne, but which had before been discovered in Java and the mountains\r\nof northern India. Its large groups of lilac flowers hung in rich\r\nfestoons from the branches as we rode under them, and caused us many an\r\ninvoluntary halt to admire and secure the plants.\r\n\r\nA rich harvest of botanical discovery still remains for the scientific\r\nexplorer of the districts south and east of Adam's Peak, whence Dr.\r\nGardner's successor, Mr. Thwaites, has already brought some remarkable\r\nspecies. Many of the Ceylon orchids, like those of South America,\r\nexhibit a grotesque similitude to various animals; and one, a\r\n_Dendrobium_., which the Singhalese cultivate in the palms near their\r\ndwelling, bears a name equivalent to the _White-pigeon flower,_ from the\r\nresemblance which its clusters present to a group of those birds in\r\nminiature clinging to the stem with wings at rest.\r\n\r\nBut of this order the most exquisite plant I have seen is the\r\n_Anæctochilus setaceus_, a terrestrial orchid which is to be found about\r\nthe moist roots of the forest trees, and has drawn the attention of even\r\nthe apathetic Singhalese, among whom its singular beauty has won for it\r\nthe popular name of the Wanna Raja, or \"King of the Forest.\" It is\r\ncommon in humid and shady places a few miles removed from the sea-coast;\r\nits flowers have no particular attraction, but its leaves are perhaps\r\nthe most exquisitely formed in the vegetable kingdom; their colour\r\nresembles dark velvet, approaching to black, and reticulated over all\r\nthe surface with veins of ruddy gold.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There is another small orchid bearing a slight resemblance\r\nto the wanna raja, which is often found growing along with it, called by\r\nthe Singhalese iri raja, or \"striped king.\" Its leaves are somewhat\r\nbronzed, but they are longer and narrower than those of the wanna raja;\r\nand, as its Singhalese name implies, it has two white stripes running\r\nthrough the length of each. They are not of the same genus; the wanna\r\nraja being the only species of _Anæctochilus_ yet found in Ceylon.]\r\n\r\nThe branches of all the lower trees and brushwood are so densely covered\r\nwith convolvuli, and similar delicate climbers of every colour, that\r\nfrequently it is difficult to discover the tree which supports them,\r\nowing to the heaps of verdure under which it is concealed. One very\r\ncurious creeper, which always catches the eye, is the square-stemmed\r\nvine[1], whose fleshy four-sided runners climb the highest trees, and\r\nhang down in the most fantastic bunches. Its stem, like that of another\r\nplant of the same genus (the _Vitis Indica_), when freshly cut, yields a\r\ncopious draught of pure tasteless fluid, and is eagerly sought after by\r\nelephants.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Cissus edulis, _Dalz_.]\r\n\r\nBut it is the trees of older and loftier growth that exhibit the rank\r\nluxuriance of these wonderful epiphytes in the most striking manner.\r\nThey are tormented by climbing plants of such extraordinary dimensions\r\nthat many of them exceed in diameter the girth of a man; and these\r\ngigantic appendages are to be seen surmounting the tallest trees of the\r\nforest, grasping their stems in firm convolutions, and then flinging\r\ntheir monstrous tendrils over the larger limbs till they reach the top,\r\nwhence they descend to the ground in huge festoons, and, after including\r\nanother and another tree in their successive toils, they once more\r\nascend to the summit, and wind the whole into a maze of living network\r\nas massy as if formed by the cable of a line-of-battle ship. When,\r\nby-and-by, the trees on which this singular fabric has become suspended\r\ngive way under its weight, or sink by their own decay, the fallen trunk\r\nspeedily disappears, whilst the convolutions of climbers continue to\r\ngrow on, exhibiting one of the most marvellous and peculiar living\r\nmounds of confusion that it is possible to fancy. Frequently one of\r\nthese creepers may be seen holding by one extremity the summit of a tall\r\ntree, and grasping with the other an object at some distance near the\r\nearth, between which it is strained as tight and straight as if hauled\r\nover a block. In all probability the young tendril had been originally\r\nfixed in this position by the wind, and retained in it till it had\r\ngained its maturity, where it has the appearance of having been\r\nartificially arranged as if to support a falling tree.\r\n\r\nThis peculiarity of tropical vegetation has been turned to profitable\r\naccount by the Ceylon woodmen, employed by the European planters in\r\nfelling forest trees, preparatory to the cultivation of coffee. In this\r\ncraft they are singularly expert, and far surpass the Malabar coolies,\r\nwho assist in the same operations. In steep and mountainous places where\r\nthe trees have been thus lashed together by the interlacing climbers,\r\nthe practice is to cut halfway through each stem in succession, till an\r\narea of some acres in extent is prepared for the final overthrow. Then\r\nsevering some tall group on the eminence, and allowing it in its descent\r\nto precipitate itself on those below, the whole expanse is in one moment\r\nbrought headlong to the ground; the falling timber forcing down those\r\nbeneath it by its weight, and dragging those behind to which it is\r\nharnessed by its living attachments. The crash occasioned by this\r\nstartling operation is so deafeningly loud, that it is audible for two\r\nor three miles in the clear and still atmosphere of the hills.\r\n\r\nOne monstrous creeping plant called by the Kandyans the Maha-pus-wael,\r\nor \"Great hollow climber,\"[1] has pods, some of which I have seen fully\r\nfive feet long and six inches broad, with beautiful brown beans, so\r\nlarge that the natives hollow them out, and carry them as tinder-boxes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Entada pursætha_. The same plant, when found in lower\r\nsituations, where it wants the soil and moisture of the mountains, is so\r\naltered in appearance that the natives call it the \"heen-pus-wael;\" and\r\neven botanists have taken it for a distinct species. The beautiful\r\nmountain region of Pusilawa, now familiar as one of the finest coffee\r\ndistricts in Ceylon, in all probability takes its name from the giant\r\nbean, \"Pus-waelawa.\"]\r\n\r\nAnother climber of less dimensions[1], but greater luxuriance, haunts\r\nthe jungle, and often reaches the tops of the highest trees, whence it\r\nsuspends large bunches of its yellow flowers, and eventually produces\r\nclusters of prickly pods containing greyish-coloured seeds, less than an\r\ninch in diameter, which are so strongly coated with silex, that they are\r\nsaid to strike fire like a flint.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Guilandina Bonduc.]\r\n\r\nOne other curious climber is remarkable for the vigour and vitality of\r\nits vegetation, a faculty in which it equals, if it do not surpass, the\r\nbanyan. This is the _Cocculus cordifolius_, the \"rasa-kindu\" of the\r\nSinghalese, a medicinal plant which produces the _guluncha_ of Bengal.\r\nIt is largely cultivated in Ceylon, and when it has acquired the\r\ndiameter of half an inch, it is not unusual for the natives to cut from\r\nthe main stem a portion of from twenty to thirty feet in length, leaving\r\nthe dissevered plant suspended from the branches of the tree which\r\nsustained it. The amputation naturally serves for a time to check its\r\ngrowth, but presently small rootlets, not thicker than a pack-thread,\r\nare seen shooting downwards from the wounded end; these swing in the\r\nwind till, reaching the ground, they attach themselves in the soil, and\r\nform new stems, which in turn, when sufficiently grown, are cut away and\r\nreplaced by a subsequent growth. Such is its tenacity of life, that when\r\nthe Singhalese wish to grow the _rasa-kindu_, they twist several yards\r\nof the stem into a coil of six or eight inches in diameter, and simply\r\nhang it on the branch of a tree, where it speedily puts forth its large\r\nheart-shaped leaves, and sends down its rootlets to the earth.\r\n\r\nThe ground too has its creepers, and some of them very curious. The most\r\nremarkable are the ratans, belonging to the Calamus genus of palms. Of\r\nthese I have seen a specimen 250 feet long and an inch in diameter,\r\nwithout a single irregularity, and no appearance of foliage other than\r\nthe bunch of feathery leaves at the extremity.\r\n\r\nThe strength of these slender plants is so extreme, that the natives\r\nemploy them with striking success in the formation of bridges across the\r\nwater-courses and ravines. One which crossed the falls of the\r\nMahawelliganga, in the Kotmahe range of hills, was constructed with the\r\nscientific precision of an engineer's work. It was entirely composed of\r\nthe plant, called by the natives the \"Waywel,\" its extremities fastened\r\nto living trees, on the opposite sides of the ravine through which a\r\nfurious and otherwise impassable mountain torrent thundered and fell\r\nfrom rock to rock with a descent of nearly 100 feet. The flooring of\r\nthis aerial bridge consisted of short splints of wood, laid\r\ntransversely, and bound in their places by thin strips of the waywel\r\nitself. The whole structure vibrated and swayed with fearful ease, but\r\nthe coolies traversed it though heavily laden; and the European, between\r\nwhose estate and the high road it lay, rode over it daily without\r\ndismounting.\r\n\r\nAnother class of trees which excites the astonishment of an European,\r\nare those whose stems are protected, as high as cattle can reach, by\r\nthorns, which in the jungle attain a growth and size quite surprising.\r\nOne species of palm[1], the _Caryota horrida,_ often rises to a height\r\nof fifty feet, and has a coating of thorns for about six or eight feet\r\nfrom the ground, each about an inch in length, and so densely covering\r\nthe stem that the bark is barely visible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This palm I have called a _Caryota_ on the authority of Dr.\r\nGARDNER, and of MOON'S _Catalogue_; but I have been informed by Dr.\r\nHOOKER and Mr. THWAITES that it is an _Areca_. The natives identify it\r\nwith the Caryota, and call it the \"katu-kittul.\"]\r\n\r\nA climbing plant, the \"Kudu-miris\" of the Singhalese[1], very common in\r\nthe hill jungles, with a diameter of three or four inches, is thickly\r\nstudded with knobs about half an inch high, and from the extremity of\r\neach a thorn protrudes, as large and sharp as the bill of a\r\nsparrow-hawk. It has been the custom of the Singhalese from time\r\nimmemorial, to employ the thorny trees of their forests in the\r\nconstruction of defences against their enemies. The _Mahawanso_ relates,\r\nthat in the civil wars, in the reign of Prakrama-bahu in the twelfth\r\ncentury, the inhabitants of the southern portion of the island\r\nintrenched themselves against his forces behind moats filled with\r\nthorns.[2] And at an earlier period, during the contest of Dutugaimunu\r\nwith Elala, the same authority states, that a town which he was about to\r\nattack was \"surrounded on all sides by the thorny _Dadambo creeper_\r\n(probably Toddalia aculeata), within which was a triple hue of\r\nfortifications, with one gate of difficult access.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Toddalia aculeata.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_ ch. lxxiv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_ ch. xxv.]\r\n\r\nDuring the existence of the Kandyan kingdom as an independent state,\r\nbefore its conquest by the British, the frontier forests were so\r\nthickened and defended by dense plantations of these thorny palms and\r\nclimbers at different points, as to exhibit a natural fortification\r\nimpregnable to the feeble tribes on the other side, and at each pass\r\nwhich led to the level country, movable gates, formed of the same\r\nformidable thorny beams, were suspended as an ample security against the\r\nincursions of the naked and timid lowlanders.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The kings of Kandy maintained a regulation \"that no one; on\r\npain of death, should presume to cut a road through the forest wider\r\nthan was sufficient for one person to pass.\"--WOLF'S _Life and\r\nAdventures_, p. 308.]\r\n\r\nThe pasture grounds throughout the vicinity of Jaffna abound in a low\r\nshrub called the Buffalo-thorn[1], the black twigs of which are beset at\r\nevery joint by a pair of thorns, set opposite each other like the horns\r\nof an ox, as sharp as a needle, from two to three inches in length, and\r\nthicker at the base than the stem they grow on.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Acacia latronum._]\r\n\r\nThe _Acacia tomentosa_ is of the same genus, with thorns so large as to\r\nbe called the \"_jungle-nail_\" by Europeans. It is frequent in the woods\r\nof Jaffna and Manaar, where it bears the Tamil name of _Aani mulla_, or\r\n\"elephant thorn.\" In some of these thorny plants, as in the _Phoberos\r\nGoertneri, Thun._,[1] the spines grow not singly, but in branching\r\nclusters, each point presenting a spike as sharp as a lancet; and where\r\nthese formidable shrubs abound they render the forest absolutely\r\nimpassable, even to the elephant and to animals of great size and force.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Wm. Ferguson writes to me, \"This is the famous\r\n_Katu-kurundu_, or 'thoray cinnamon,' of the Singhalese, figured and\r\ndescribed by Gaertner as the _Limonia pusilla_, which after a great deal\r\nof labour and research I think I have identified as the _Phoberos\r\nmacrophyllus_\" (W. and A. Prod. p. 30). Thunberg alludes to it\r\n(_Travels_, vol. iv.)--\"Why the Singhalese have called it a cinnamon, I\r\ndo not know, unless from some fancied similarity in its seeds to those\r\nof the cinnamon laurel.\"]\r\n\r\nThe family of trees which, from their singularity as well as their\r\nbeauty, most attract the eye of the traveller in the forests of Ceylon,\r\nare the palms, which occur in rich profusion, although, of upwards of\r\nsix hundred species which are found in other countries, not more than\r\nten or twelve are indigenous to the island.[1] At the head of these is\r\nthe coco-nut, every particle of whose substance, stem, leaves, and\r\nfruit, the Singhalese turn to so many accounts, that one of their\r\nfavourite topics to a stranger is to enumerate the _hundred_ uses to\r\nwhich they tell us this invaluable tree is applied.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Thwaites has enumerated fifteen species (including the\r\ncoco-nut, and excluding the _Nipa fruticans_, which more properly\r\nbelongs to the family of screw-pines): viz. Areca, 4; Caryota, 1;\r\nCalamus, 5; Borassus, 1; Corypha, 1; Phoenix, 2; Cocos, 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The following are only a few of the countless uses of this\r\ninvaluable tree. The _leaves_, for roofing, for mats, for baskets,\r\ntorches or chules, fuel, brooms, fodder for cattle, manure. The _stem of\r\nthe leaf_, for fences, for pingoes (or yokes) for carrying burthens on\r\nthe shoulders, for fishing-rods, and innumerable domestic utensils. The\r\n_cabbage_ or cluster of unexpended leaves, for pickles and preserves.\r\nThe _sap_ for _toddy_, for distilling arrack, and for making vinegar,\r\nand sugar. The _unformed nut_, for medicine and sweetmeats. The _young\r\nnut_ and its milk, for drinking, for dessert; the _green husk_ for\r\npreserves. The _nut_, for eating, for curry, for milk, for cooking. The\r\n_oil_, for rheumatism, for anointing the hair, for soap, for candles,\r\nfor light; and the _poonak_, or refuse of the nut after expressing the\r\noil, for cattle and poultry. The _shell of the nut_, for drinking cups,\r\ncharcoal, tooth-powder, spoons, medicine, hookahs, beads, bottles, and\r\nknife-handles. The _coir_, or fibre which envelopes the shell within the\r\nouter husk, for mattresses, cushions, ropes, cables, cordage, canvass,\r\nfishing-nets, fuel, brushes, oakum, and floor mats. The _trunk_, for\r\nrafters, laths, railing, boats, troughs, furniture, firewood; and when\r\nvery young, the first shoots, or cabbage, as a vegetable for the table.\r\nThe entire list, with a Singhalese enthusiast, is an interminable\r\nnarration of the virtues of his favourite tree.]\r\n\r\nThe most majestic and wonderful of the palm tribe is the _talpat_ or\r\n_talipat_[1], the stem of which sometimes attains the height of 100\r\nfeet, and each of its enormous fan-like leaves, when laid upon the\r\nground, will form a semicircle of 16 feet in diameter, and cover an area\r\nof nearly 200 superficial feet. The tree flowers but once, and dies; and\r\nthe natives firmly believe that the bursting of the shadix is\r\naccompanied by a loud explosion. The leaves alone are converted by the\r\nSinghalese to purposes of utility. Of them they form coverings for their\r\nhouses, and portable tents of a rude but effective character; and on\r\noccasions of ceremony, each chief and headman on walking abroad is\r\nattended by a follower, who holds above his head an\r\nelaborately-ornamented fan, formed from a single leaf of the talpat.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Corypha umbraculifera, _Linn._]\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting use to which they are applied is as substitutes\r\nfor paper, both for books and for ordinary purposes. In the preparation\r\nof _olas_, which is the term applied to them when so employed, the\r\nleaves are taken whilst still tender, and, after separating the central\r\nribs, they are cut into strips and boiled in spring water. They are\r\ndried first in the shade, and afterwards in the sun, then made into\r\nrolls, and kept in store, or sent to the market for sale. Before they\r\nare fit for writing on they are subjected to a second process, called\r\n_madema_. A smooth plank of areca-palm is tied horizontally between two\r\ntrees, each ola is then damped, and a weight being attached to one end\r\nof it, it is drawn backwards and forwards across the edge of the wood\r\ntill the surface becomes perfectly smooth and polished; and during the\r\nprocess, as the moisture dries up, it is necessary to renew it till the\r\neffect is complete. The smoothing of a single ola will occupy from\r\nfifteen to twenty minutes.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Vol. II. p. 528.]\r\n\r\nThe finest specimens in Ceylon are to be obtained at the Panselas, or\r\nBuddhist monasteries; they are known as _pusk[(o]la_ and are prepared by\r\nthe Samanera priests (novices) and the students, under the\r\nsuperintendence of the priests.\r\n\r\nThe raw leaves, when dried without any preparation, are called\r\n_karak[(o]la_, and, like the leaves of the palmyra, are used only for\r\nordinary purposes by the Singhalese; but in the Tamil districts, where\r\npalmyras are abundant, and talpat palms rare, the leaves of the former\r\nare used for books as well as for letters.\r\n\r\nThe _palmyra_[1] is another invaluable palm, and one of the most\r\nbeautiful of the family. It grows in such profusion over the north of\r\nCeylon, and especially in the peninsula of Jaffna, as to form extensive\r\nforests, whence its timber is exported for rafters to all parts of the\r\nisland, as well as to the opposite coast of India, where, though the\r\npalmyra grows luxuriantly, its wood, from local causes, is too soft and\r\nperishable to be used for any purpose requiring strength and durability,\r\nqualities which, in the palmyra of Ceylon, are pre-eminent. To the\r\ninhabitants of the northern provinces this invaluable tree is of the\r\nsame importance as the coco-nut palm is to the natives of the south. Its\r\nfruit yields them food and oil; its juice \"palm wine\" and sugar; its\r\nstem is the chief material of their buildings; and its leaves, besides\r\nserving as roofs to their dwellings and fences to their farms, supply\r\nthem with matting and baskets, with head-dresses and fans, and serve as\r\na substitute for paper for their deeds and writings, and for the sacred\r\nbooks, which contain the traditions of their faith. It has been said\r\nwith truth that a native of Jaffna, if he be contented with ordinary\r\ndoors and mud walls, may build an entire house (as he wants neither\r\nnails nor iron work), with walls, roof, and covering from the Palmyra\r\npalm. From this same tree he may draw his wine, make his oil, kindle his\r\nfire, carry his water, store his food, cook his repast, and sweeten it,\r\nif he pleases; in fact, live from day to day dependent on his palmyra\r\nalone. Multitudes so live, and it may be safely asserted that this tree\r\nalone furnishes one-fourth the means of sustenance for the population of\r\nthe northern provinces.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Borassus flabelliformis_. For an account of the Palmyra,\r\nand its cultivation in the peninsula of Jaffna, see FERGUSON'S monograph\r\non the _Palmyra Palm of Ceylon_, Colombo, 1850.]\r\n\r\nThe _Jaggery Palm_[1], the _Kitool_ of the Singhalese, is chiefly\r\ncultivated in the Kandyan hills for the sake of its sap, which is drawn,\r\nboiled down, and crystallised into a coarse brown sugar, in universal\r\nuse amongst the inhabitants of the south and west of Ceylon, who also\r\nextract from its pith a farina scarcely inferior to sago. The black\r\nfibre of the leaf is twisted by the Rodiyas into ropes of considerable\r\nsmoothness and tenacity. A single Kitool tree has been pointed out at\r\nAmbogammoa, which furnished the support of a Kandyan, his wife, and\r\ntheir children. A tree has been known to yield one hundred pints of\r\ntoddy within twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Caryota urens.]\r\n\r\nThe _Areca_[1] _Palm_ is the invariable feature of a native garden,\r\nbeing planted near the wells and water-courses, as it rejoices in\r\nmoisture. Of all the tribe it is the most graceful and delicate, rising\r\nto the height of forty or fifty feet[2], without an inequality on its\r\nthin polished stem, which is dark green towards the top, and sustains a\r\ncrown of feathery foliage, in the midst of which are clustered the\r\nastringent nuts for whose sake it is carefully tended.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A. catechu.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Mr. Ferguson measured an areca at Caltura which was\r\nseventy-five feet high, and grew near a coco-nut which was upwards of\r\nninety feet. Caltura is, however, remarkable for the growth and\r\nluxuriance of its vegetation.]\r\n\r\nThe chewing of these nuts with lime and the leaf of the betel-pepper\r\nsupplies to the people of Ceylon the same enjoyment which tobacco\r\naffords to the inhabitants of other countries; but its use is, if\r\npossible, more offensive, as the three articles, when combined, colour\r\nthe saliva of so deep a red that the lips and teeth appear as if covered\r\nwith blood. Yet, in spite of this disgusting accompaniment, men and\r\nwomen, old and young, from morning till night indulge in the repulsive\r\nluxury.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. Elliot, of Colombo, has observed several cases of\r\ncancer in the cheek which, from its peculiar characteristics, he has\r\ndesignated the \"betel-chewer's cancer.\"]\r\n\r\nIt is seldom, however, that we find in semi-civilised life habits\r\nuniversally prevailing which have not their origin, however ultimately\r\nthey may be abused by excess, in some sense of utility. The Turk, when\r\nhe adds to the oppressive warmth of the sun by enveloping his forehead\r\nin a cumbrous turban, or the Arab, when he increases the sultry heat by\r\nswathing his waist in a showy girdle, may appear to act on no other\r\ncalculation than a willingness to sacrifice comfort to a love of\r\ndisplay; but the custom in each instance is the result of precaution--in\r\nthe former, because the head requires especial protection from\r\nsun-strokes; and in the latter, from the fact well known to the Greeks\r\n([Greek: eozônoi Achaioi]) that, in a warm climate, danger is to be\r\napprehended from a sudden chill to that particular region of the\r\nstomach. In like manner, in the chewing of the areca-nut with its\r\naccompaniments of lime and betel, the native of Ceylon is unconsciously\r\napplying a specific corrective to the defective qualities of his daily\r\nfood. Never eating flesh meat by any chance, seldom or never using milk,\r\nbutter, poultry, or eggs, and tasting fish but occasionally (more rarely\r\nin the interior of the island,) the non-azotised elements abound in\r\nevery article he consumes with the exception of the bread-fruit, the\r\njak, and some varieties of beans. In their indolent and feeble stomachs\r\nthese are liable to degenerate into flatulent and acrid products; but,\r\napparently by instinct, the whole population have adopted a simple\r\nprophylactic. Every Singhalese carries in his waistcloth an ornamented\r\nbox of silver or brass, according to his means, enclosing a smaller one\r\nto hold a portion of chunam (lime obtained by the calcination of shells)\r\nwhilst the larger contains the nuts of the areca and a few fresh leaves\r\nof the betel-pepper. As inclination or habit impels, he scrapes down the\r\nnut, which abounds in catechu, and, rolling it up with a little of the\r\nlime in a betel-leaf, the whole is chewed, and finally swallowed, after\r\nprovoking an extreme salivation. No medical prescription could be more\r\njudiciously compounded to effect the desired object than this practical\r\ncombination of antacid, the tonic, and carminative.\r\n\r\nThe custom is so ancient in Ceylon and in India that the Arabs and\r\nPersians who resorted to Hindustan in the eighth and ninth centuries\r\ncarried back the habit to their own country; and Massoudi, the traveller\r\nof Bagdad, who wrote the account of his voyages in A.D. 943, states that\r\nthe chewing of betel prevailed along the southern coast of Arabia, and\r\nreached as far as Yemen and Mecca.[1] Ibn Batuta saw the betel plant at\r\nZahfar A.D. 1332, and describes it accurately as trained like a vine\r\nover a trellis of reeds, or climbing the steins of the coco-nut palm.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Massoudi, _Maraudj-al-Dzeheb_, as translated by REINAUD,\r\n_Mémoire_ _sur l'Lede_. p. 230.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Voyages_, &c. t. ii. p. 205.]\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the coca[1] supply the Indians of Bolivia and Peru with a\r\nstimulant, whose use is equivalent to that of the betel-pepper among the\r\nnatives of Hindustan and the Eastern Archipelago. With an admixture of\r\nlime, they are chewed perseveringly; but, unlike the betel, the colour\r\nimparted by them to the saliva is greenish, instead of red. It is\r\ncurious, too, as a coincidence common to the humblest phases of\r\nsemi-civilised life, that, in the absence of coined money, the leaves of\r\nthe coca form a rude kind of currency in the Andes, as does the betel in\r\nsome parts of Ceylon, and tobacco amongst the tribes of the south-west\r\nof Africa.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Erythroxylon coca.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Tobacco was a currency in North America when Virginia was\r\ncolonised in the early part of the 17th century; debts were contracted\r\nand paid in it, and in every ordinary transaction tobacco answered the\r\npurposes of coin.]\r\n\r\nNeither catechu nor its impure equivalent, \"terra japonica,\" is prepared\r\nfrom the areca in Ceylon; but the nuts are exported in large quantities\r\nto the Maldive Islands and to India, the produce of which they excel\r\nboth in astringency and size. The fibrous wood of the areca being at\r\nonce straight, firm, and elastic, is employed for making the pingoes\r\n(yokes for the shoulders), by means of which the Singhalese coolie, like\r\nthe corresponding class among the ancient Egyptians and the Greeks,\r\ncarries his burdens, dividing them into portions of equal weight, one of\r\nwhich is suspended from each end of the pingo. By a swaying motion\r\ncommunicated to them as he starts, his own movement is facilitated,\r\nwhereas one unaccustomed to the work, by allowing the oscillation to\r\nbecome irregular, finds it almost impossible to proceed with a load of\r\nany considerable weight.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The natives of Tahti use a yoke of the same form as the\r\nSinghalese _pingo_, but made from the wood of the _Hibiscus\r\ntiliaceus._--DARWIN, _Nat. Voy._ ch. xviii. p. 407. For a further\r\naccount of the pingo see Vol. I. Part iv. ch. viii. p. 497.]\r\n\r\n_Timber trees_, either for export or domestic use, are not found in any\r\nabundance except in the low country, and here the facility of floating\r\nthem to the sea, down the streams which intersect the eastern coast of\r\nthe island, has given rise to an active trade at Batticaloa and\r\nTrincomalie. But, unfortunately, the indifference of the local officers\r\nentrusted with the issue of licences to fell, and the imperfect control\r\nexercised over the adventurers who embark in these speculations, has led\r\nto a destruction of trees quite disproportionate to the timber obtained,\r\nand utterly incompatible with the conservation of the valuable kinds.\r\nThe East India Company have had occasion to deplore the loss of their\r\nteak forests by similar neglect and mismanagement; and it is to be hoped\r\nthat, ere too late, the attention of the Ceylon Government may be so\r\ndirected to this important subject as to lead to the appointment of\r\ncompetent foresters, under whose authority and superintendence the\r\nfelling of timber may be carried on.\r\n\r\nAn interesting memoir on the timber trees of Ceylon has been prepared by\r\na native officer at Colombo, Adrian Mendis, of Morottu,\r\ncarpeater-moodliar to the Royal Engineers, in which he has enumerated\r\nupwards of ninety species, which, in various parts of the island, are\r\nemployed either as timber or cabinet woods.[1] Of these, the jak, the\r\nKangtal of Bengal (_Artocarpus integrifolia_), is, next to the coco-nut\r\nand Palmyra, by far the most valuable to the Singhalese; its fruit,\r\nwhich sometimes attains the weight of 50 lbs., supplying food for their\r\ntable, its leaves fodder for their cattle, and its trunk timber for\r\nevery conceivable purpose both oeconomic and ornamental. The Jak tree,\r\nas well as the Del, or wild bread-fruit, is indigenous to the forests on\r\nthe coast and in the central provinces; but, although the latter is\r\nfound in the vicinity of the villages, it does not appear to be an\r\nobject of special cultivation. The Jak, on the contrary, is planted near\r\nevery house, and forms the shade of every garden. Its wood, at first\r\nyellow, approaches the colour of mahogany after a little exposure to the\r\nair, and resembles it at all times in its grain and marking.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mendis' List will be found appended to the _Ceylon\r\nCalendar_ for 1854.]\r\n\r\nThe Del (_Artocarpus pubescens_) affords a valuable timber, not only for\r\narchitectural purposes, but for ship-building. It and the Halmalille[1]\r\nresembling but larger than the linden tree of England, to which it is\r\nclosely allied, are the favourite building woods of the natives, and the\r\nlatter is used for carts, casks, and all household purposes, as well as\r\nfor the hulls of their boats, from the belief that It resists the attack\r\nof the marine worms, and that some unctuous property in the wood\r\npreserves the iron work from rust.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Berry a ammonilla.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Masula boats, which brave the formidable surf of Madrus\r\nare made of Halmalille, which is there called \"Trincomalie wood\" from\r\nthe place of exportation.]\r\n\r\nThe Teak (_Tectona grandis_), which is superior to all others, is not a\r\nnative of this island, and although largely planted, has not been\r\naltogether successful. But the satin-wood[1], in point of size and\r\ndurability, is by far the first of the timber trees of Ceylon. For days\r\ntogether I have ridden under its magnificent shade. All the forests\r\naround Batticaloa and Trincomalie, and as far north as Jaffna, are\r\nthickly set with this valuable tree. It grows to the height of a hundred\r\nfeet, with a rugged grey bark, small white flowers, and polished leaves,\r\nwith a somewhat unpleasant odour. Owing to the difficulty of carrying\r\nits heavy beams, the natives only cut it near the banks of the rivers,\r\ndown which it is floated to the coast, whence large quantities are\r\nexported to every part of the colony. The richly-coloured and feathery\r\npieces are used for cabinet-work, and the more ordinary logs for\r\nbuilding purposes, every house in the eastern province being floored and\r\ntimbered with satin-wood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Chieroxylon Swietenia.]\r\n\r\nAnother useful tree, very common in Ceylon, is the Suria[1], with\r\nflowers so like those of a tulip that Europeans know it as the tulip\r\ntree. It loves the sea air and saline soils. It is planted all along the\r\navenues and streets in the towns near the coast, where it is equally\r\nvalued for its shade and the beauty of its yellow flowers, whilst its\r\ntough wood is used for carriage shafts and gun-stocks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Thespesia populnea.]\r\n\r\nThe forests to the east furnish the only valuable cabinet woods used in\r\nCeylon, the chief of which is ebony[1], which grows in great abundance\r\nthroughout all the flat country to the west of Trincomalie. It is a\r\ndifferent species from the ebony of Mauritius[2], and excels it and all\r\nothers in the evenness and intensity of its colour. The centre of the\r\ntrunk is the only portion which furnishes the extremely black part which\r\nis the ebony of commerce; but the trees are of such magnitude that\r\nreduced logs of two feet in diameter, and varying from ten to fifteen\r\nfeet in length, can readily be procured from the forests at Trincomalie.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Diospyros ebenum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: D. reticulata.]\r\n\r\nThere is another cabinet wood, of extreme beauty, called by the natives\r\nCadooberia. It is a bastard species of ebony[1], in which the prevailing\r\nblack is stained with stripes of rich brown, approaching to yellow and\r\npink. But its density is inconsiderable, and in durability it is far\r\ninferior to that of true ebony.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: D. ebenaster.]\r\n\r\nThe Calamander[1], the most valuable cabinet wood of the island,\r\nresembling rose-wood, but much surpassing it both in beauty and\r\ndurability, has at all times been in the greatest repute in Ceylon. It\r\ngrows chiefly in the southern provinces, and especially in the forests\r\nat the foot of Adam's Peak; but here it has been so prodigally felled,\r\nfirst by the Dutch, and afterwards by the English, without any\r\nprecautions for planting or production, that it has at last become\r\nexceedingly rare. Wood of a large scantling is hardly procurable at any\r\nprice; and it is only in a very few localities, the principal of which\r\nis Saffragam, in the western province, that even small sticks are now to\r\nbe found; one reason, assigned for this is that the heart of the tree is\r\nseldom sound, a peculiarity which extends to the Cadooberia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: D. hirsuta.]\r\n\r\nThe twisted portions, and especially the roots of the latter, yield\r\nveneers of unusual beauty, dark wavings and blotches, almost black,\r\nbeing gracefully disposed over a delicate fawn-coloured ground. Its\r\ndensity is so great (nearly 60 lbs. to a cubic foot) that it takes an\r\nexquisite polish, and is in every way adapted for the manufacture of\r\nfurniture, in the ornamenting of which the native carpenters excel. The\r\nchiefs and headmen, with a full appreciation of its beauty, take\r\nparticular pride in possessing specimens of this beautiful wood, roots\r\nof which they regard as most acceptable gifts.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its value, the tree is nearly eradicated, and runs some\r\nrisk of becoming extinct in the island; but, as it is not peculiar to\r\nCeylon, it may be restored by fresh importations from the south-eastern\r\ncoast of India, of which it is equally a native, and I apprehend that\r\nthe name, _Calamander_, which was used by the Dutch, is but a corruption\r\nof \"Coromandel.\"\r\n\r\nAnother species of cabinet wood is produced from the Nedun[1], a large\r\ntree common on the western coast; it belongs to the Pea tribe, and is\r\nallied to the Sisso of India. Its wood, which is lighter than the\r\n\"Blackwood\" of Bombay, is used for similar purposes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dalbergia lanceolaria.]\r\n\r\nThe Tamarind tree[1], and especially its fine roots, produce a\r\nvariegated cabinet wood of much beauty, but of such extreme hardness as\r\nscarcely to be workable by any ordinary tool.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Tamarindus Indica.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The natives of Western India have a belief that the shade\r\nof the tamarind tree is unhealthy, if not poisonous. But in Ceylon it is\r\nan object of the people, especially in the north of the island, to build\r\ntheir houses under it, from the conviction that of all trees its _shade\r\nis the coolest_. In this feeling, too, the Europeans are so far disposed\r\nto concur that it has been suggested whether there may not be something\r\npeculiar in the respiration of its leaves. The Singhalese have an idea\r\nthat the twigs of the ranna-wara (_Cassia auriculata_) diffuse an\r\nagreeable coolness, and they pull them for the sake of enjoying it by\r\nholding them in their hands or applied to the head. In the south of\r\nCeylon it is called the Matura tea-tree, its leaves being infused as a\r\nsubstitute for tea.]\r\n\r\nAs to fruit trees, it is only on the coast, or near the large villages\r\nand towns, that they are found in any perfection. In the deepest jungle\r\nthe sight of a single coco-nut towering above the other foliage is in\r\nCeylon a never-failing landmark to intimate to a traveller his approach\r\nto a village. The natives have a superstition that the coco-nut will not\r\ngrow _out of the sound of the human voice_, and will die if the village\r\nwhere it had previously thriven become deserted; the solution of the\r\nmystery being in all probability the superior care and manuring which it\r\nreceives in such localities.[1] In the generality of the forest hamlets\r\nthere are always to be found a few venerable Tamarind trees of\r\npatriarchal proportions, the ubiquitous Jak, with its huge fruits,\r\nweighing from 5 to 50 lbs. (the largest eatable fruit in the world),\r\neach springing from the rugged surface of the bark, and suspended by a\r\npowerful stalk, which attaches it to the trunk of the tree. Lime-trees,\r\nOranges, and Shaddoks are carefully cultivated in these little gardens,\r\nand occasionally the Rose-apple and the Cachu-nut, the Pappaya, and\r\ninvariably as plentiful a supply of Plantains as they find it prudent to\r\nraise without inviting the visits of the wild elephants, with whom they\r\nare especial favourites.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Vol. II. p. 125.]\r\n\r\nThese, and the Bilimbi and Guava, the latter of which is naturalised in\r\nthe jungle around every cottage, are almost the only fruits of the\r\ncountry; but the Pine-apple, the Mango, the Avocado-pear, the\r\nCustard-apple, the Rambutan (_Nephelium lappaceum_), the Fig, the\r\nGranadilla, and a number of other exotics, are successfully reared in\r\nthe gardens of the wealthier inhabitants of the towns and villages; and\r\nwithin the last few years the peerless Mangustin of Malacca, the\r\ndelicacy of which we can imagine to resemble that of perfumed snow, has\r\nbeen successfully cultivated in the gardens of Caltura and Colombo.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the orange, the fruits of Ceylon have one\r\ndeficiency, common, I apprehend, to all tropical countries. They are\r\nwanting in that piquancy which in northern climates is attributable to\r\nthe exquisite perfection in which the sweet and aromatic flavours are\r\nblended with the acidulous. Either the acid is so ascendant as to be\r\nrepulsive to the European palate, or the saccharine so preponderates as\r\nto render Singhalese fruit cloying and distasteful.\r\n\r\nStill, all other defects are compensated by the coolness which pervades\r\nthem; and, under the exhaustion of a blazing sun, no more exquisite\r\nphysical enjoyment can be imagined than the chill and fragrant flesh of\r\nthe pine-apple, or the abundant juice of the mango, which, when freshly\r\npulled, feels as cool as iced water. But the fruit must be eaten\r\ninstantly; even an interval of a few minutes after it has been gathered\r\nis sufficient to destroy the charm; for, once severed from the stem, it\r\nrapidly acquires the temperature of the surrounding air.\r\n\r\nSufficient admiration has hardly been bestowed upon the marvellous power\r\ndisplayed by the vegetable world in adjusting its own temperature,\r\nnotwithstanding atmospheric fluctuations,--a faculty in the\r\nmanifestation of which it appears to present a counterpart to that\r\nexhibited by animal oeconomy in regulating its heat. So uniform is the\r\nexercise of the latter faculty in man and the higher animals, that there\r\nis barely a difference of three degrees between the warmth of the body\r\nin the utmost endurable vicissitudes of heat and cold; and in vegetables\r\nan equivalent arrangement enables them in winter to keep their\r\ntemperature somewhat above that of the surrounding air, and in summer to\r\nreduce it far below it. It would almost seem as if plants possessed a\r\npower of producing cold analogous to that exhibited by animals in\r\nproducing heat; and of this beneficent arrangement man enjoys the\r\nbenefit in the luxurious coolness of the fruit which nature lavishes on\r\nthe tropics.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar organisation by which this result is obtained is not free\r\nfrom obscurity, but in all probability the means of adjusting the\r\ntemperature of plants is simply dependent on evaporation. As regards the\r\npower possessed by vegetables of generating heat, although it has been\r\ndemonstrated to exist, it is in so trifling a degree as to be almost\r\ninappreciable, except at the period of germination, when it probably\r\narises from the consumption of oxygen in generating the carbonic acid\r\ngas which is then evolved. The faculty of retaining this warmth at night\r\nand at other times may, therefore, be referable mainly to the closing of\r\nthe pores, and the consequent check of evaporation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the faculty of maintaining a temperature below that\r\nof the surrounding air, can only be accounted for by referring it to the\r\nmechanical process of imbibing a continuous supply of fresh moisture\r\nfrom the soil, the active transpiration of which imparts coolness to\r\nevery portion of the tree and its fruit. It requires this combined\r\noperation to produce the desired result; and the extent to which\r\nevaporation can bring down the temperature of the moisture received by\r\nabsorption, may be inferred from the fact that Dr. Hooker, when in the\r\nvalley of the Ganges, found the fresh milky juice of the Mudar\r\n(_calotropis_) to be but 72°, whilst the damp sand in the bed of the\r\nriver where it grew was from 90° to 104°.\r\n\r\nEven in temperate climates this phenomenon is calculated to excite\r\nadmiration; but it is still more striking to find the like effect rather\r\nincreased than diminished in the tropics, where one would suppose that\r\nthe juices, especially of a small and delicate plant, before they could\r\nbe cooled by evaporation, would be liable to be heated by the blazing\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nA difficulty would also seem to present itself in the instance of fruit,\r\nwhose juices, having to undergo a chemical change, their circulation\r\nwould be conjectured to be slower; and in the instance of those with\r\nhard skins, such as the pomegranate, or with a tough leathery coating,\r\nlike the mango, the evaporation might be imagined to be less than in\r\nthose of a soft and spongy texture. But all share alike in the general\r\ncoolness of the plant, so long as circulation supplies fluid for\r\nevaporation; and the moment this resource is cut off by the separation\r\nof the fruit from the tree, the supply of moisture failing, the process\r\nof refrigeration is arrested, and the charm of agreeable freshness gone.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to notice the aquatic plants, which are found in greater\r\nprofusion in the northern and eastern provinces than in any other\r\ndistricts of the island, owing to the innumerable tanks and neglected\r\nwatercourses which cover the whole surface of this once productive\r\nprovince, but which now only harbour the alligator, or satisfy the\r\nthirst of the deer and the elephant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See on this subject LINDLEY'S _Introduction to Botany_,\r\nvol. ii. book ii. ch. viii. p. 215.\r\n\r\nCARPENTER, _Animal Physiology_, ch. ix. s. 407. CARPENTER'S _Vegetable\r\nPhysiology_, ch. xi. s. 407, Lond. 1848.]\r\n\r\nThe chief ornaments of these neglected sheets of water are the large red\r\nand white Lotus[1], whose flowers may be seen from a great distance\r\nreposing on their broad green leaves. In China and some parts of India\r\nthe black seeds of these plants, which are not unlike little acorns in\r\nshape, are served at table in place of almonds, which they are said to\r\nresemble, but with a superior delicacy of flavour. At some of the tanks\r\nwhere the lotus grows in profusion in Ceylon, I tasted the seeds\r\nenclosed in the torus of the flowers, and found them white and\r\ndelicately-flavoured, not unlike the small kernel of the pine cone of\r\nthe Apennines. This red lotus of the island appears to be the one that\r\nHerodotus describes as abounding in the Nile in his time, but which is\r\nnow extinct; with a flower resembling a rose, and a fruit in shape like\r\na wasp's nest, and containing seeds of the size of an olive stone, and\r\nof an agreeable flavour.[2] But it has clearly no identity with those\r\nwhich he describes as the food of the Lotophagi of Africa, of the size\r\nof the mastic[3], sweet as a date, and capable of being made into wine.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Nelumbium speciosum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Herodotus, b. ii. s. 92.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The words are \"[Greek: Esti megathos hoson te tês schinou]\"\r\n(Herod. b. iv. s. 177); and as [Greek: schinos] means also a _squill_ or\r\na _sea-onion_, the fruit above referred to, as the food of the\r\nLotophagi, must have been of infinitely larger size and in every way\r\ndifferent from the lotus of the Nile, described in the 2nd book, as well\r\nas from the lotus in the East. Lindley records the conjecture that the\r\narticle referred to by Herodotus was the _nabk_, the berry of the\r\nlote-bush (_Zizyphus lotus_), which the Arabs of Barbary still eat.\r\n(_Vegetable Kingdom_, p. 582.)]\r\n\r\nOne species of the water lily, the _Nymphæa rubra_, with small red\r\nflowers, and of great beauty, is common in the ponds near Jaffna and in\r\nthe Wanny; and I found in the fosse, near the fort of Moeletivoe, the\r\nbeautiful blue lotus, _N. stellata_, with lilac petals, approaching to\r\npurple in the centre, which had not previously been supposed to be a\r\nnative of the island.\r\n\r\nAnother very interesting aquatic plant, which was discovered by Dr.\r\nGardner in the tanks north of Trincomalie, is the _Desmanthus natans_,\r\nwith highly sensitive leaves floating on the surface of the water. It is\r\nborne aloft by masses of a spongy cellular substance, which occur at\r\nintervals along its stem and branches, but the roots never touch the\r\nbottom, absorbing nourishment whilst floating at liberty, and only found\r\nin contact with the ground after the subsidence of water in the\r\ntanks.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A species of _Utricularia_, with yellow flowers (U.\r\nstellaris), is a common water-plant in the still lakes near the fort of\r\nColombo, where an opportunity is afforded of observing the extraordinary\r\nprovision of nature for its reproduction. There are small appendages\r\nattached to the roots, which become distended with air, and thus carry\r\nthe plant aloft to the surface, during the cool season. Here it floats\r\ntill the operation of flowering is over, when the vesicles burst, and by\r\nits own weight it returns to the bottom of the lake to ripen its seeds\r\nand deposit them in the soil; after which the air vessels again fill,\r\nand again it re-ascends to undergo the same process of fecundation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nMAMMALIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Mammalia and the Birds, the fauna of Ceylon\r\nhas, up to the present, failed to receive that systematic attention to\r\nwhich its richness and variety so amply entitle it. The Singhalese\r\nthemselves, habitually indolent and singularly unobservant of nature in\r\nher operations, are at the same time restrained from the study of\r\nnatural history by tenets of their religion which forbid the taking of\r\nlife under any circumstances. From the nature of their avocations, the\r\nmajority of the European residents engaged in planting and commerce, are\r\ndiscouraged from gratifying this taste; and it is to be regretted that\r\nthe civil servants of the government, whose position and duties would\r\nhave afforded them influence and extended opportunity for successful\r\ninvestigation, have never seen the importance of encouraging such\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\nThe first effective impulse to the cultivation of natural science in\r\nCeylon, was communicated by Dr. Davy when connected with the medical\r\nstaff of the army from 1816 to 1820, and his example stimulated some of\r\nthe assistant surgeons of Her Majesty's forces to make collections in\r\nillustration of the productions of the colony. Of the late Dr. Kinnis\r\nwas one of the most energetic and successful. He was seconded by Dr.\r\nTempleton of the Royal Artillery, who engaged assiduously in the\r\ninvestigation of various orders, and commenced an interchange of\r\nspecimens with Mr. Blyth[1], the distinguished naturalist and curator of\r\nthe Calcutta Museum.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Journ. Asiat. Soc. Bengal,_ vol. xv. p. 280, 314.]\r\n\r\nThe birds and rarer vertebrata of the island were thus compared with\r\ntheir peninsular congeners, and a tolerable knowledge of those belonging\r\nto the island, so far as regards the higher classes of animals, has been\r\nthe result. The example so set has been perseveringly followed by Mr.\r\nE.L. Layard and Dr. Kelaart, and infinite credit is due to Mr. Blyth for\r\nthe zealous and untiring energy with which he has devoted his attention\r\nand leisure to the identification of the various interesting species\r\nforwarded from Ceylon, and to their description in the Calcutta Journal.\r\nTo him, and to the gentleman I have named, we are mainly indebted, for\r\nwhatever accurate knowledge we now possess of the zoology of the colony.\r\n\r\nThe mammalia, birds, and reptiles received their first scientific\r\ndescription in an able work published recently by Dr. Kelaart of the\r\narmy medical staff[1], which is by far the most valuable that has yet\r\nappeared on the Singhalese fauna. Co-operating with him, Mr. Layard has\r\nsupplied a fund of information especially in ornithology and conchology.\r\nThe zoophytes and crustacea have been investigated by Professor Harvey,\r\nwho visited Ceylon for that purpose in 1852, and by Professor Schmarda,\r\nof the University of Prague, who was lately sent there for a similar\r\nobject. From the united labours of these gentlemen and others interested\r\nin the same pursuits, we may hope at an early day to obtain such a\r\nknowledge of the zoology of Ceylon, as may to some extent compensate for\r\nthe long indifference of the government officers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Prodromus Faunæ Zeylanicæ; being Contributions to the\r\nZoology of Ceylon_, by F. KELAART, Esq., M.D., F.L.S., &c. &c. 2 vols.\r\nColombo and London, 1852. Mr. DAVY, of the Medical Staff; brother to Sir\r\nHumphry, published in 1821 his _Account of the Interior of Ceylon and\r\nits Inhabitants_, which contains the earliest notices of the natural\r\nhistory of the island, and especially of the Ophidian reptiles.]\r\n\r\nI. QUADRUMANA. 1 _Monkeys_.--To a stranger in the tropics, among the\r\nmost attractive creatures in the forests are the troops of _monkeys_,\r\nwhich career in ceaseless chase among the loftiest trees. In Ceylon\r\nthere are five species, four of which belong to one group, the\r\nWanderoos, and the other is the little graceful grimacing _rilawa_[1],\r\nwhich is the universal pet and favourite, of both natives and Europeans.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Macacus pileatus_, Shaw and Desmmarest. The \"bonneted\r\nMacaque\" is common in the south and west; and a spectacled monkey is\r\n_said_ to inhabit the low country near to Bintenne; but I have never\r\nseen one brought thence. A paper by Dr. TEMPLETON in the _Mag. Nat.\r\nHist_. n.s. xiv. p. 361, contains some interesting facts relative to the\r\nRilawa of Ceylon.]\r\n\r\nKNOX, in his captivating account of the island, gives an accurate\r\ndescription of both; the Rilawas, with \"no beards, white faces, and long\r\nhair on the top of their heads, which parteth and hangeth down like a\r\nman's, and which do a deal of mischief to the corn, and are so impudent\r\nthat they will come into their gardens, and eat such fruit as grows\r\nthere. And the Wanderoos, some as large as our English Spaniel dogs, of\r\na darkish grey colour, and black faces with great white beards round\r\nfrom ear to ear, which makes them shew just like old men. This sort does\r\nbut little mischief, keeping in the woods, eating only leaves and buds\r\nof trees, but when they are catched they will eat anything.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: KNOX, _Historical Relation of Ceylon, an Island in the East\r\nIndies_.--P. i. ch. vi. p. 25. Fol. Lond. 1681.]\r\n\r\nKNOX, whose experience was confined almost exclusively to the hill\r\ncountry around Kandy, spoke in all probability of one large and\r\ncomparatively powerful species, _Presbytes ursinus_, which inhabits the\r\nlofty forests, and which, as well as another of the same group, _P.\r\nThersites_, was, till recently, unknown to European naturalists. The\r\nSinghalese word _Ouanderu_ has a generic sense, and being in every\r\nrespect the equivalent for our own term of \"monkey,\" it necessarily\r\ncomprehends the low country species, as well as those which inhabit\r\nother parts of the island. And, in point of fact, in the island there\r\nare no less than four animals, each of which is entitled to the name of\r\n\"wanderoo.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Down to a very late period, a large and somewhat\r\nrepulsive-looking monkey, common to the Malabar coast, the Silenus\r\nveter, _Linn_., was, from the circumstance of his possessing a \"great\r\nwhite beard,\" incorrectly assumed to be the \"wanderoo\" of Ceylon,\r\ndescribed by KNOX; and under that usurped name it has figured in every\r\nauthor from Buffon to the present time. Specimens of the true Singhalese\r\nspecies were, however, received in Europe; but in the absence of\r\ninformation in this country as to their actual habitat, they were\r\ndescribed, first by Zimmerman, on the continent, under the name of\r\n_Leucoprymnus cephalopterus,_ and subsequently by Mr. E. Bennett, under\r\nthat of _Semnopithecus Nestor (Proc. Zool. Soc._ pt. i. p. 67: 1833);\r\nthe generic and specific characters being on this occasion most\r\ncarefully pointed out by that eminent naturalist. Eleven years later Dr.\r\nTempleton forwarded to the Zoological Society a description, accompanied\r\nby drawings, of the wanderoo of the western maritime districts of\r\nCeylon, and noticed the fact that the wanderoo of authors (S. veter) was\r\nnot to be found in the island except as an introduced species in the\r\ncustody of the Arab horse-dealers, who visit the port of Colombo at\r\nstated periods. Mr. Waterhouse, at the meeting (_Proc. Zool. Soc._ p. 1:\r\n1844) at which this communication was read, recognised the identity of\r\nthe subject of Dr. Templeton's description with that already laid before\r\nthem by Mr. Bennett; and from this period the species in question was\r\nbelieved to truly represent the wanderoo of Knox. The later discovery,\r\nhowever, of the P. ursinus by Dr. Kelaart, in the mountains amongst\r\nwhich we are assured that Knox spent so many years of captivity, reopens\r\nthe question, but at the same time appears to me to clearly demonstrate\r\nthat in this latter we have in reality the animal to which his narrative\r\nrefers.]\r\n\r\nEach separate species has appropriated to itself a different district of\r\nthe wooded country, and seldom encroaches on the domain of its\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\n1. Of the four species found in Ceylon, the most numerous in the island,\r\nand the one best known in Europe, is the Wanderoo of the low country,\r\nthe _P. cephalopterus_ of Zimmerman.[1] It is an active and intelligent\r\ncreature, not much larger than the common bonneted Macaque, and far from\r\nbeing so mischievous as others of the monkeys in the island. In\r\ncaptivity it is remarkable for the gravity of its demeanour and for an\r\nair of melancholy in its expression and movements, which is completely\r\nin character with its snowy beard and venerable aspect. Its disposition\r\nis gentle and confiding, it is in the highest degree sensible of\r\nkindness, and eager for endearing attentions, uttering a low plaintive\r\ncry when its sympathies are excited. It is particularly cleanly in its\r\nhabits when domesticated, and spends much of its time in trimming its\r\nfur, and carefully divesting its hair of particles of dust.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Leucoprymnus Nestor, _Bennett_.]\r\n\r\nAlthough common in the southern and western provinces, it is never found\r\nat a higher elevation than 1300 feet.\r\n\r\nWhen observed in their native wilds, a party of twenty or thirty of\r\nthese creatures is generally busily engaged in the search for berries\r\nand buds. They are seldom to be seen on the ground, and then only when\r\nthey have descended to recover seeds or fruit that have fallen at the\r\nfoot of their favourite trees. In their alarm, when disturbed, their\r\nleaps are prodigious; but generally speaking, their progress is made not\r\nso much by _leaping_ as by swinging from branch to branch, using their\r\npowerful arms alternately; and when baffled by distance, flinging\r\nthemselves obliquely so as to catch the lower boughs of an opposite\r\ntree, the momentum acquired by their descent being sufficient to cause a\r\nrebound, that carries them again upwards, till they can grasp a higher\r\nbranch; and thus continue their headlong flight. In these perilous\r\nachievements, wonder is excited less by the surpassing agility of these\r\nlittle creatures, frequently encumbered as they are by their young,\r\nwhich cling to them in their career, than by the quickness of their eye\r\nand the unerring accuracy with which they seem almost to calculate the\r\nangle at which a descent would enable them to cover a given distance,\r\nand the recoil to elevate themselves again to a higher altitude.\r\n\r\n2. The low country Wanderoo is replaced in the hills by the larger\r\nspecies, _P. ursinus_, which inhabits the mountain zone. The natives,\r\nwho designate the latter the _Maha_ or Great Wanderoo, to distinguish it\r\nfrom the _Kaloo_, or black one, with which they are familiar, describe\r\nit as much wilder and more powerful than its congener of the lowland\r\nforests. It is rarely seen by Europeans, this portion of the country\r\nhaving till very recently been but partially opened; and even now it is\r\ndifficult to observe its habits, as it seldom approaches the few roads\r\nwhich wind through these deep solitudes. It was first captured by Dr.\r\nKelaart in the woods near Neuera-ellia, and from its peculiar appearance\r\nit has been named _P. ursinus_ by Mr. Blyth.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Blyth quotes as authority for this trivial name a\r\npassage from MAJOR FORBES' _Eleven Years in Ceylon_; and I can vouch for\r\nthe graphic accuracy of the remark.--\"A species of very large monkey,\r\nthat passed some distance before me, when resting on all fours, looked\r\nso like a Ceylon bear, that I nearly took him for one.\"]\r\n\r\n3. The _P. Thersites_, which is chiefly distinguished from the others by\r\nwanting the head tuft, is so rare that it was for some time doubtful\r\nwhether the single specimen procured by Dr. Templeton from\r\nNeuera-kalawa, west of Trincomalie, and on which Mr. Blyth conferred\r\nthis new name, was in reality native; but the occurrence of a second,\r\nsince identified by Dr. Kelaart, has established its existence as a\r\nseparate species.\r\n\r\nLike the common wanderoo, this one was partial to fresh vegetables,\r\nplantains, and fruit; but he ate freely boiled rice, beans, and gram. He\r\nwas fond of being noticed and petted, stretching out his limbs in\r\nsuccession to be scratched, drawing himself up so that his ribs might be\r\nreached by the finger, and closing his eyes during the operation,\r\nevincing his satisfaction by grimaces irresistibly ludicrous.\r\n\r\n4. The _P. Priamus_ inhabits the northern and eastern provinces, and the\r\nwooded hills which occur in these portions of the island. In appearance\r\nit differs both in size and in colour from the common wanderoo, being\r\nlarger and more inclining to grey; and in habits it is much less\r\nreserved. At Jaffna, and in other parts of the island where the\r\npopulation is comparatively numerous, these monkeys become so\r\nfamiliarised with the presence of man as to exhibit the utmost daring\r\nand indifference. A flock of them will take possession of a Palmyra\r\npalm; and so effectually can they crouch and conceal themselves among\r\nthe leaves that, on the slightest alarm, the whole party becomes\r\ninvisible in an instant. The presence of a dog, however, excites such an\r\nirrepressible curiosity that, in order to watch his movements, they\r\nnever fail to betray themselves. They may be seen frequently congregated\r\non the roof of a native hut; and, some years ago, the child of a\r\nEuropean clergyman stationed at Tillipalli having been left on the\r\nground by the nurse, was so teased and bitten by them as to cause its\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese have the impression that the remains of a monkey are\r\nnever found in the forest; a belief which they have embodied in the\r\nproverb that \"he who has seen a white crow, the nest of a paddy bird, a\r\nstraight coco-nut tree, or a dead monkey, is certain to live for ever.\"\r\nThis piece of folk-lore has evidently reached Ceylon from India, where\r\nit is believed that persons dwelling on the spot where a hanuman monkey,\r\n_S. entellus_, has been killed, will die, and that even its bones are\r\nunlucky, and that no house erected where they are hid under ground can\r\nprosper. Hence when a house is to be built, it is one of the employments\r\nof the Jyotish philosophers to ascertain by their science that none such\r\nare concealed; and Buchanan observes that \"it is, perhaps, owing to this\r\nfear of ill-luck that no native will acknowledge his having seen a dead\r\nhanuman.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: BUCHANAN'S _Survey of Bhagulpoor_, p. 142. At Gibraltar it\r\nis believed that the body of _a dead monkey_ is never found on the\r\nrock.]\r\n\r\nThe only other quadrumanous animal found in Ceylon is the little\r\nloris[1], which, from its sluggish movements, nocturnal habits, and\r\nconsequent inaction during the day, has acquired the name of the \"Ceylon\r\nSloth.\" There are two varieties in the island; one of the ordinary\r\nfulvous brown, and another larger, whose fur is entirely black. A\r\nspecimen of the former was sent to me from Chilaw, on the western coast,\r\nand lived for some time at Colombo, feeding on rice, fruit, and\r\nvegetables. It was partial to ants and other insects, and always eager\r\nfor milk or the bone of a fowl. The naturally slow motion of its limbs\r\nenables the loris to approach its prey so stealthily that it seizes\r\nbirds before they can be alarmed by its presence. The natives assert\r\nthat it has been known to strangle the pea-fowl at night, and feast on\r\nthe brain. During the day the one which I kept was usually asleep in the\r\nstrange position represented below; its perch firmly grasped with all\r\nhands, its back curved into a ball of soft fur, and its head hidden deep\r\nbetween its legs. The singularly-large and intense eyes of the loris\r\nhave attracted the attention of the Singhalese, who capture the creature\r\nfor the purpose of extracting them as charms and love-potions, and this\r\nthey are said to effect by holding the little animal to the fire till\r\nits eyeballs burst. Its Tamil name is _theivangu_, or \"thin-bodied;\" and\r\nhence a deformed child or an emaciated person has acquired in the Tamil\r\ndistricts the same epithet. The light-coloured variety of the loris in\r\nCeylon has a spot on its forehead, somewhat resembling the _namam_, or\r\nmark worn by the worshippers of Vishnu; and, from this peculiarity, it\r\nis distinguished as the _Nama-theivangu_.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Loris gracilis, _Geoff_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: There is an interesting notice of the loris of Ceylon by\r\nDr. TEMPLETON, in the _Mag. Nat. Hist_. 1844, ch. xiv. p. 362.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LORIS]\r\n\r\nII. CHEIROPTERA. _Bats_.--The multitude of _bats_ is one of the features\r\nof the evening landscape; they abound in every cave and subterranean\r\npassage, in the tunnels on the highways, in the galleries of the\r\nfortifications, in the roofs of the bungalows, and the ruins of every\r\ntemple and building. At sunset they are seen issuing from their diurnal\r\nretreats to roam through the twilight in search of crepuscular insects,\r\nand as night approaches and the lights in the rooms attract the\r\nnight-flying lepidoptera, the bats sweep round the dinner-table and\r\ncarry off their tiny prey within the glitter of the lamps. Including the\r\nfrugivorous section about sixteen species have been identified in\r\nCeylon, and of these, two varieties are peculiar to the island. The\r\ncolours of some of them are as brilliant as the plumage of a bird,\r\nbright yellow, deep orange, and a rich ferruginous brown inclining to\r\nred.[1] The Roussette[2] of Ceylon (the \"Flying-fox,\" as it is usually\r\ncalled by Europeans) measures from three to four feet from point to\r\npoint of its extended wings, and some of them have been seen wanting but\r\na few inches of five feet in the alar expanse. These sombre-looking\r\ncreatures feed chiefly on ripe fruits, the guava, the plantain, and the\r\nrose-apple, and are abundant in all the maritime districts, especially\r\nat the season when the silk-cotton tree, the _pulun-imbul_,[3] is\r\nputting forth its flower-buds, of which they are singularly fond. By day\r\nthey suspend themselves from the highest branches, hanging by the claws\r\nof the hind legs, pressing the chin against the breast, and using the\r\nclosed membrane attached to the forearms as a mantle to envelope the\r\nhead. At sunset launching into the air, they hover with a murmuring\r\nsound occasioned by the beating of their broad membranous wings, around\r\nthe fruit trees, on which they feed till morning, when they resume their\r\npensile attitude as before. They are strongly attracted to the coco-nut\r\ntrees during the period when toddy is drawn for distillation, and\r\nexhibit, it is said, at such times symptoms resembling intoxication.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1:\r\n  Rhinolophus affinis? _var_. rubidus, _Kelaart_.\r\n  Hipposideros murinus, _var_. fulvus, _Kelaart_.\r\n  Hipposideros speoris, _var_. aureus, _Kelaart_.\r\n  Kerivoula picta, _Pallas_.\r\n  Scotophilus Heathii, _Horsf_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Pteropus Edwardsii, _Geoff_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Eriodendron orientale, _Stead_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Mr. THWAITES, of the Royal Botanic Garden, at Kandy, in a\r\nrecent letter, 19th Dec. 1858, gives the following description of a\r\nperiodical visit of the pteropus to an avenue of fig-trees:--\"You would\r\nbe much interested now in observing a colony of the _pteropus_ bat,\r\nwhich has established itself for a season on some trees within sight of\r\nmy bungalow. They came about the same time last year, and, after staying\r\na few weeks, disappeared: I suppose they had demolished all the\r\navailable food in the neighbourhood. They are now busy of an evening\r\neating the figs of _Ficus elastica_, of which we have a long avenue in\r\nthe grounds, as I dare say you remember.\r\n\r\n\"These bats take possession during the day of particular trees, upon\r\nwhich they hang like so much ripe fruit, but they take it into their\r\nheads to have some exercise every morning between the hours of 9 and 11,\r\nduring which they are wheeling about in the air by the hundred,\r\nseemingly enjoying the sunshine and warmth. They then return to their\r\nfevourite tree, and remain quiet until the evening, when they move off\r\ntowards their feeding ground. There is a great chattering and screaming\r\namongst them before they can get agreeably settled in their places after\r\ntheir morning exercise; quarrelling, I suppose, for the most comfortable\r\nspots to hang on by during the rest of the day. The trees they take\r\npossession of become nearly stripped of leaves; and it is a curious\r\nsight to see them in such immense numbers. I do not allow them to be\r\ndisturbed.\"]\r\n\r\nThe flying-fox is killed by the natives for the sake of its flesh, which\r\nI have been told, by a gentleman who has eaten it, resembles that of the\r\nhare.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In Western India the native Portuguese eat the flying-fox,\r\nand pronounce it delicate, and far from disagreeable in flavour.]\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties (some of them peculiar to the island) of the\r\nhorse-shoe-headed _Rhinolophus_, with the strange leaf-like appendage\r\nerected on the extremity of the nose. It has been suggested that bats,\r\nthough nocturnal, are deficient in that keen vision characteristic of\r\nanimals which take their prey at night. I doubt whether this conjecture\r\nbe well founded; but at least it would seem that in their peculiar\r\noeconomy some additional power is required to supplement that of vision,\r\nas in insects that of touch is superadded, in the most sensitive\r\ndevelopment, to that of sight. Hence, it is possible that the extended\r\nscreen stretched at the back of their nostrils may be intended by nature\r\nto facilitate the collection and conduction of odours, as the vast\r\ndevelopment of the shell of the ear in the same family is designed to\r\nassist in the collection of sounds--and thus to reinforce their vision\r\nwhen in pursuit of their prey at twilight by the superior sensitiveness\r\nof the organs of hearing and smell, as they are already remarkable for\r\nthat marvellous sense of touch which enables them, even when deprived of\r\nsight, to direct their flight with security, by means of the delicate\r\nnerves of the wing. One tiny little bat, not much larger than the humble\r\nbee[1], and of a glossy black colour, is sometimes to be seen about\r\nColombo. It is so familiar and gentle that it will alight on the cloth\r\nduring dinner, and manifests so little alarm that it seldom makes any\r\neffort to escape before a wine glass can be inverted to secure it.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is a _very_ small Singhalese variety of Scotophilus\r\nCoromandelicus; _F. Cuv_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For a notice of the curious parasite peculiar to the bat,\r\nsee Note A. end of this chapter.]\r\n\r\nIII. CARNIVORA.--_Bears_.--Of the _carnivora_, the one most dreaded by\r\nthe natives of Ceylon, and the only one of the larger animals which\r\nmakes the depths of the forest its habitual retreat, is the bear[1],\r\nattracted by the honey which is to be found in the hollow trees and\r\nclefts of the rocks. Occasionally spots of fresh earth are observed\r\nwhich have been turned up by them in search of some favourite root. They\r\nfeed also on the termites and ants. A friend of mine traversing the\r\nforest near Jaffna, at early dawn, had his attention attracted by the\r\ngrowling of a bear, which was seated upon a lofty branch thrusting\r\nportions of a red-ant's nest into its mouth with one paw, whilst with\r\nthe other he endeavoured to clear his eyebrows and lips of the angry\r\ninmates which bit and tortured him in their rage. The Ceylon bear is\r\nfound only in the low and dry districts of the northern and\r\nsouth-eastern coast, and is seldom met with on the mountains or the\r\nmoist and damp plains of the west. It is furnished with a bushy tuft of\r\nhair on the back, between the shoulders, to which the young are\r\naccustomed to cling till sufficiently strong to provide for their own\r\nsafety. During a severe drought which prevailed in the northern province\r\nin 1850, the district of Caretchy was so infested by bears that the\r\nOriental custom of the women resorting to the wells was altogether\r\nsuspended, as it was a common occurrence to find one of these animals in\r\nthe water, unable to climb up the yielding and slippery soil, down which\r\nhis thirst had impelled him to slide during the night.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Prochilus labiatus, _Blainville_.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the structure of the bear shows him to be naturally omnivorous,\r\nhe rarely preys upon flesh in Ceylon, and his solitary habits whilst in\r\nsearch of honey and fruits, render him timid and retiring. Hence he\r\nevinces alarm on the approach of man or other animals, and, unable to\r\nmake a rapid retreat, his panic rather than any vicious disposition\r\nleads him to become an assailant in self-defence. But so furious are his\r\nassaults under such circumstances that the Singhalese have a terror of\r\nhis attack greater than that created by any other beast of the forest.\r\nIf not armed with a gun, a native, in the places where bears abound,\r\nusually carries a light axe, called \"kodelly,\" with which to strike them\r\non the head. The bear, on the other hand, always aims, at the face, and,\r\nif successful in prostrating his victim, usually commences by assailing\r\nthe eyes. I have met numerous individuals on our journeys who exhibited\r\nfrightful scars from these encounters, the white seams of their wounds\r\ncontrasting hideously with the dark colour of the rest of their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe Veddahs in Bintenne, whose chief stores consist of honey, live in\r\ndread of the bears, because, attracted by its perfume, they will not\r\nhesitate to attack their rude dwellings, when allured by this\r\nirresistible temptation. The Post-office runners, who always travel by\r\nnight, are frequently exposed to danger from these animals, especially\r\nalong the coast from Putlam to Aripo, where they are found in\r\nconsiderable numbers; and, to guard against surprise, they are\r\naccustomed to carry flambeaux, to give warning to the bears, and enable\r\nthem to shuffle out of the path.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Amongst the Singhalese there is a belief that certain\r\ncharms are efficacious in protecting them from the violence of bears,\r\nand those whose avocations expose them to encounters of this kind are\r\naccustomed to carry a talisman either attached to their neck or\r\nenveloped in the folds of their luxuriant hair. A friend of mine,\r\nwriting of an adventure which occurred at Anarajapoora, thus describes\r\nan occasion on which a Moor, who attended him, was somewhat rudely\r\ndisabused of his belief in the efficacy of charms upon bears:--\"Desiring\r\nto change the position of a herd of deer, the Moorman (with his charm)\r\nwas sent across some swampy land to disturb them. As he was proceeding\r\nwe saw him suddenly turn from an old tree and run back with all speed,\r\nhis hair becoming unfastened and like his clothes streaming in the wind.\r\nIt soon became evident that he was flying from some terrific object, for\r\nhe had thrown down his gun, and, in his panic, he was taking the\r\nshortest line towards us, which lay across a swamp covered with sedge\r\nand rushes that greatly impeded his progress, and prevented us\r\napproaching him, or seeing what was the cause of his flight. Missing his\r\nsteps from one hard spot to another he repeatedly fell into the water,\r\nbut he rose and resumed his flight. I advanced as far as the sods would\r\nbear my weight, but to go further was impracticable. Just within ball\r\nrange there was an open space, and, as the man gained it, I saw that he\r\nwas pursued by a bear and two cubs. As the person of the fugitive\r\ncovered the bear, it was impossible to fire without risk. At last he\r\nfell exhausted, and the bear being close upon him, I discharged both\r\nbarrels. The first broke the bear's shoulder, but this only made her\r\nmore savage, and rising on her hind legs she advanced with ferocious\r\ngrunts, when the second barrel, though I do not think it took effect,\r\nserved to frighten her, for turning round she retreated at full speed,\r\nfollowed by the cubs. Some natives then waded through the mud to the\r\nMoorman, who was just exhausted and would have been drowned but that he\r\nfell with his head upon a tuft of grass: the poor man was unable to\r\nspeak, and for several weeks his intellect seemed confused. The\r\nadventure sufficed to satisfy him that he could not again depend upon a\r\ncharm to protect him from bears, though he always insisted that but for\r\nits having fallen from his hair where he had fastened it under his\r\nturban, the bear would not have ventured to attack him.\"]\r\n\r\nLeopards[1] are the only formidable members of the tiger race in Ceylon,\r\nand they are neither very numerous nor very dangerous as they seldom\r\nattack man. By Europeans they are commonly called cheetahs; but the true\r\ncheetah, the hunting leopard of India (_Felis jubata_), does not exist\r\nin Ceylon. There is a rare variety which has been found in various parts\r\nof the island, in which the skin, instead of being spotted, is of a\r\nuniform black.[2] The leopards frequent the vicinity of pasture lands in\r\nquest of the deer and other peaceful animals which resort to them; and\r\nthe villagers often complain of the destruction of their cattle by these\r\nformidable marauders. In relation to them, the natives have a curious\r\nbut firm conviction that when a bullock is killed by a leopard, and, in\r\nexpiring, falls so that _its right side is undermost_, the leopard will\r\nnot return to devour it. I have been told by English sportsmen (some of\r\nwhom share in the popular belief), that sometimes, when they have\r\nproposed to watch by the carcase of a bullock recently killed by a\r\nleopard, in the hope of shooting the spoiler on his return in search of\r\nhis prey, the native owner of the slaughtered animal, though earnestly\r\ndesiring to be avenged, has assured them that it would be in vain, as,\r\nthe beast having fallen on its right side, the leopard would not return.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Felis pardus, _Linn_. What is called a leopard, or a\r\ncheetah, in Ceylon, is in reality the true panther.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: F. melas, _Peron_ and _Leseur_.]\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese hunt them for the sake of their extremely beautiful\r\nskins, but prefer taking them in traps and pitfalls, and occasionally in\r\nspring cages formed of poles driven firmly into the ground, within which\r\na kid is generally fastened as a bait; the door being held open by a\r\nsapling bent down by the united force of several men, and so arranged to\r\nact as a spring, to which a noose is ingeniously attached, formed of\r\nplaited deer hide. The cries of the kid attract the leopards, one of\r\nwhich, being tempted to enter, is enclosed by the liberation of the\r\nspring and grasped firmly round the body by the noose.\r\n\r\nLike the other carnivora, they are timid and cowardly in the presence of\r\nman, never intruding on him voluntarily and making a hasty retreat when\r\napproached. Instances have, however, occurred of individuals having been\r\nslain by them, and like the tiger, it is believed, that, having once\r\ntasted human blood they acquire an habitual relish for it. A peon on\r\nnight duty at the courthouse at Anarajapoora, was some years ago carried\r\noff by a leopard from a table in the verandah on which he had laid down\r\nhis head to sleep. At Batticaloa a \"cheetah\" in two instances in\r\nsuccession was known to carry off men placed on a stage erected in a\r\ntree to drive away elephants from the rice-lands: but such cases are\r\nrare, and as compared with their dread of the bear, the natives of\r\nCeylon entertain but slight apprehensions of the \"cheetah.\" It is,\r\nhowever, the dread of sportsmen, whose dogs when beating in the jungle\r\nare especially exposed to its attacks: and I am aware of one instance in\r\nwhich a party having tied their dogs to the tent-pole for security, and\r\nfallen asleep around them, a leopard sprang into the tent and carried\r\noff a dog from the midst of its slumbering masters.\r\n\r\nThey are strongly attracted by the peculiar odour which accompanies\r\nsmall-pox. The reluctance of the natives to submit themselves or their\r\nchildren to vaccination exposes the island to frightful visitations of\r\nthis disease; and in the villages in the interior it is usual on such\r\noccasions to erect huts in the jungle to serve as temporary hospitals.\r\nTowards these the leopards are certain to be allured; and the medical\r\nofficers are obliged to resort to increased precautions in consequence.\r\nOn one occasion being in the mountains near Kandy, a messenger\r\ndespatched to me through the jungle excused his delay by stating that a\r\n\"cheetah\" had seated itself in the only practicable path, and remained\r\nquietly licking its fore paws and rubbing them over its face, till he\r\nwas forced to drive it, with stones, into the forest.\r\n\r\nMajor Skinner, who for upwards of forty years has had occasion to live\r\nalmost constantly in the interior, occupied in the prosecution of\r\nsurveys and the construction of roads, is strongly of opinion that\r\ntowards man the disposition of the leopard is essentially pacific, and\r\nthat, when discovered, its natural impulse is to effect its escape. In\r\nillustration of this, I insert an extract from one of his letters, which\r\ndescribes an adventure highly characteristic of this instinctive\r\ntimidity.\r\n\r\n\"On the occasion of one of my visits to Adam's Peak in the prosecution\r\nof my military reconnoissances of the mountain, zone, I fixed on a\r\npretty little patena (i.e. meadow) in the midst of an extensive and\r\ndense forest in the southern segment of the Peak Range, as a favourable\r\nspot for operations. It would have been difficult, after descending from\r\nthe cone of the peak, to have found one's way to this point, in the\r\nmidst of so vast a wilderness of trees, had not long experience assured\r\nme that good game tracks would be found leading to it, and by one of\r\nthem I reached it. It was in the afternoon, just after one of those\r\ntropical sun-showers which decorate every branch and blade with its\r\npendant brilliants, and the little patena was covered with game, either\r\ndriven to the open space by the drippings from the leaves or tempted by\r\nthe freshness of the pasture: there were several pairs of elk, the\r\nbearded antlered male contrasting finely with his mate; and other\r\nvarieties of game in a profusion not to be found in any place frequented\r\nby man. It was some time before I could allow them to be disturbed by\r\nthe rude fall of the axe, in our necessity to establish our bivouac for\r\nthe night, and they were so unaccustomed to danger, that it was long\r\nbefore they took alarm at our noises.\r\n\r\n\"The following morning, anxious to gain a height in time to avail myself\r\nof the clear atmosphere of sunrise for my observations, I started off by\r\nmyself through the jungle, leaving orders for my men, with my surveying\r\ninstruments, to follow my track by the notches which I cut in the bark\r\nof the trees. On leaving the plain, I availed myself of a fine wide game\r\ntrack which lay in my direction, and had gone, perhaps half a mile from\r\nthe camp, when I was startled by a slight rustling in the nilloo[1] to\r\nmy right, and in another instant, by the spring of a magnificent leopard\r\nwhich, in a bound of full eight feet in height over the lower brushwood,\r\nlighted at my feet within eighteen inches of the spot whereon I stood,\r\nand lay in a crouching position, his fiery gleaming eyes fixed on me.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A species of one of the suffruticose _Acanthacea_ which\r\ngrows abundantly in the mountain ranges of Ceylon. See _ante_, p. 90 n.]\r\n\r\n\"The predicament was not a pleasant one. I had no weapon of defence, and\r\nwith one spring or blow of his paw the beast could have annihilated me.\r\nTo move I knew would only encourage his attack. It occurred to me at the\r\nmoment that I had heard of the power of man's eye over wild animals, and\r\naccordingly I fixed my gaze as intently, as the agitation of such a\r\nmoment enabled me, on his eyes: we stared at each other for some\r\nseconds, when, to my inexpressible joy, the beast turned and bounded\r\ndown the straight open path before me.\" \"This scene occurred just at\r\nthat period of the morning when the grazing animals retired from the\r\nopen patena to the cool shade of the forest: doubtless, the leopard had\r\ntaken my approach for that of a deer, or some such animal. And if his\r\nspring had been at a quadruped instead of a biped, his distance was so\r\nwell measured, that it must have landed him on the neck of a deer, an\r\nelk, or a buffalo; as it was, one pace more would have done for me. A\r\nbear would not have let his victim off so easily.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said, but I never have been able personally to verify the fact,\r\nthat the Ceylon leopard exhibits a peculiarity in being unable entirely\r\nto retract its claws within their sheaths.\r\n\r\nOf the lesser feline species the number and variety in Ceylon is\r\ninferior to that of India. The Palm-cat[1] lurks by day among the fronds\r\nof the coco-nut trees, and by night makes destructive forays on the\r\nfowls of the villagers; and, in order to suck the blood of its victim,\r\ninflicts a wound so small as to be almost imperceptible. The glossy\r\ngenette[2], the \"_Civet_\" of Europeans, is common in the northern\r\nprovince, where the Tamils confine it in cages for the sake of its musk,\r\nwhich they collect from the wooden bars on which it rubs itself. Edrisi,\r\nthe Moorish geographer, writing in the twelfth century, enumerates musk\r\nas one of the productions then exported from Ceylon.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Paradoxurus typus, _F. Cuv_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Viverra Indica, _Geoffr., Hodgson_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: EDRISI, _Géogr_., sec. vii. Jaubert's translation, t. ii.\r\np. 72.]\r\n\r\n_Dogs_.--There is no native wild dog in Ceylon, but every village and\r\ntown is haunted by mongrels of European descent, which are known by the\r\ngeneric description of _Pariahs_. They are a miserable race,\r\nacknowledged by no owners, living on the garbage of the streets and\r\nsewers, lean, wretched, and mangy, and if spoken to unexpectedly,\r\nshrinking with an almost involuntary cry. Yet in these persecuted\r\noutcasts there survives that germ of instinctive affection which binds\r\nthe dog to the human race, and a gentle word, even a look of\r\ncompassionate kindness, is sufficient foundation for a lasting\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese, from their religious aversion to taking away life in any\r\nform, permit the increase of these desolate creatures till in the hot\r\nseason they become so numerous as to be a nuisance; and the only\r\nexpedient hitherto devised by the civil government to reduce their\r\nnumbers, is once in each year to offer a reward for their destruction,\r\nwhen the Tamils and Malays pursue them in the streets with clubs (guns\r\nbeing forbidden by the police for fear of accidents), and the\r\nunresisting dogs are beaten to death on the side-paths and door steps,\r\nwhere they had been taught to resort for food. Lord Torrington, during\r\nhis tenure of office, attempted the more civilised experiment of putting\r\nsome check on their numbers, by imposing a dog tax, the effect of which\r\nwould have been to lead to the drowning of puppies; whereas there is\r\nreason to believe that dogs are at present _bred_ by the horse-keepers\r\nto be killed for sake of the reward.\r\n\r\n_Jackal_.--The Jackal[1] in the low country hunts in packs, headed by a\r\nleader, and these audacious prowlers have been seen to assault and pull\r\ndown a deer. The small number of hares in the districts they infest is\r\nascribed to their depredations. An excrescence is sometimes found on the\r\nhead of the jackal, consisting of a small horny cone about half an inch\r\nin length, and concealed by a tuft of hair. This the natives call\r\n_Narri-comboo_, and they aver that this \"Jackal's Horn\" only grows on\r\nthe head of the leader of the pack.[2] The Singhalese and the Tamils\r\nalike regard it as a talisman, and believe that its fortunate possessor\r\ncan command by its instrumentality the realisation of every wish, and\r\nthat if stolen or lost by him, it will invariably return of its own\r\naccord. Those who have jewels to conceal, rest in perfect security if\r\nalong with them they can deposit a Narri-comboo, fully convinced that\r\nits presence is an effectual safeguard against robbers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Canis aureus. _Linn_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In the Museum of the College of Surgeons, London (No. 4362\r\nA), there is a cranium of a jackal which exhibits this strange osseous\r\nprocess on the super-occipital; and I have placed along with it a\r\nspecimen of the horny sheath, which was presented to me by Mr.\r\nLavalliere, the district judge of Kandy.]\r\n\r\nJackals are subject to hydrophobia, and instances are frequent of cattle\r\nbeing bitten by them and dying in consequence.\r\n\r\n_The Mongoos_.--Of the Mongoos or Ichneumons five species have been\r\ndescribed; and one which frequents the hills near Neuera-ellia[1], is so\r\nremarkable from its bushy fur, that the invalid soldiers in the\r\nsanatarium, to whom it is familiar, call it the \"Ceylon Badger.\" I have\r\nfound universally that the natives of Ceylon attach no credit to the\r\nEuropean story of the Mongoos (_H. griseus_) resorting to some plant,\r\nwhich no one has yet succeeded in identifying, as an antidote against\r\nthe bite of the venomous serpents on which it preys. There is no doubt\r\nthat in its conflicts with the cobra de capello and other poisonous\r\nsnakes, which it attacks with as little hesitation as the harmless ones,\r\nit may be seen occasionally to retreat, and even to retire into the\r\njungle, and, it is added, to eat some vegetable; but a gentleman who has\r\nbeen a frequent observer of its exploits, assures me that most usually\r\nthe herb it resorted to was grass; and if this were not at hand, almost\r\nany other that grew near seemed equally acceptable. Hence has probably\r\narisen the long list of plants; such as the _Ophioxylon serpentinum_ and\r\n_Ophiorhiza mungos_, the _Aristolochia Indica_, the _Mimosa octandru_,\r\nand others, each of which has been asserted to be the ichneumon's\r\nspecific; whilst their multiplicity is demonstrative of the\r\nnon-existence of any one in particular to which the animal resorts for\r\nan antidote. Were there any truth in the tale as regards the mongoos, it\r\nwould be difficult to understand, why other creatures, such as the\r\nsecretary bird and the falcon, which equally destroy serpents, should be\r\nleft defenceless, and the ichneumon alone provided with a prophylactic.\r\nBesides, were the ichneumon inspired by that courage which would result\r\nfrom the consciousness of security, it would be so indifferent to the\r\nbite of the serpent, that we might conclude that, both in its approaches\r\nand its assault, it would be utterly careless as to the precise mode of\r\nits attack. Such, however, is far from being the case; and next to its\r\naudacity, nothing is more surprising than the adroitness with which it\r\nescapes the spring of the snake under a due sense of danger, and the\r\ncunning with which it makes its arrangements to leap upon the back and\r\nfasten its teeth in the head of the cobra. It is this display of\r\ninstinctive ingenuity that Lucan[2] celebrates where he paints the\r\nichneumon diverting the attention of the asp, by the motion of his bushy\r\ntale, and then seizing it in the midst of its confusion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Herpestes vitticollis_. Mr. W. ELLIOTT, in his _Catalogue\r\nof Mammalia found in the Southern Maharata Country_, Madras, 1840, says,\r\nthat \"One specimen of this Herpestes was procured by accident in the\r\nGhat forests in 1829, and is now deposited in the British Museum; it is\r\nvery rare, inhabiting only the thickest woods, and its habits are very\r\nlittle known,\" p. 9. In Ceylon, it is comparatively common.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The passage in Lucan is a versification of the same\r\nnarrative related by Pliny, lib. viii. ch. 35; and Ælian, lib. iii. ch.\r\n22.]\r\n\r\n  \"Aspidas ut Pharias caudâ solertior hostis\r\n  Ludit, et iratas incertâ provocat umbrâ:\r\n  Obliquusque caput vanas serpentis in auras\r\n  Effusæ toto comprendit guttura morsu\r\n  Letiferam citra saniem; tune irrita pestis\r\n  Exprimitur, faucesque fluunt pereunte veneno.\"\r\n\r\n_Pharsalia_, lib. iv. v. 729.\r\n\r\nThe mystery of the mongoos and its antidote has been referred to the\r\nsupposition that there may be some peculiarity in its organisation which\r\nrenders it _proof against_ the poison of the serpent. It remains for\r\nfuture investigation to determine how far this conjecture is founded in\r\ntruth; and whether in the blood of the mongoos there exists any element\r\nor quality which acts as a prophylactic. Such exceptional provisions are\r\nnot without precedent in the animal oeconomy: the hornbill feeds with\r\nimpunity on the deadly fruit of the strychnos; the milky juice of some\r\nspecies of euphorbia, which is harmless to oxen, is invariably fatal to\r\nthe zebra; and the tsetse fly, the pest of South Africa, whose bite is\r\nmortal to the ox, the dog, and the horse, is harmless to man and the\r\nuntamed creatures of the forest.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. LIVINGSTONE, _Tour in S. Africa_, p. 80. Is it a fact\r\nthat in America, pigs extirpate the rattlesnakes with impunity?]\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese distinguish one species of mongoos, which they designate\r\n\"_Hotambeya_,\" and which they assert never preys upon serpents. A writer\r\nin the _Ceylon Miscellany_ mentions, that they are often to be seen\r\n\"crossing rivers and frequenting mud-brooks near Chilaw; the adjacent\r\nthickets affording them shelter, and their food consisting of aquatic\r\nreptiles, crabs, and mollusca.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This is possibly the \"musbilai\" or mouse-cat of Behar,\r\nwhich preys upon birds and fish. Could it be the Urva of the Nepalese\r\n(_Urva cancrivora_, Hodgson), which Mr. Hodgson describes as dwelling in\r\nburrows, and being carnivorous and ranivorous?--Vide _Journ. As. Soc.\r\nBeng._, vol. vi. p. 56.]\r\n\r\nIV. RODENTIA. _Squirrels_.--Smaller animals in great numbers enliven the\r\nforests and lowland plains with their graceful movements. Squirrels[1],\r\nof which there are a great variety, make their shrill metallic call\r\nheard at early morning in the woods, and when sounding their note of\r\nwarning on the approach of a civet or a tree-snake, the ears tingle with\r\nthe loud trill of defiance, which rings as clear and rapid as the\r\nrunning down of an alarum, and is instantly caught up and re-echoed from\r\nevery side by their terrified playmates.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Of two kinds which frequent the mountains, one which is\r\npeculiar to Ceylon was discovered by Mr. Edgar L. Layard, who has done\r\nme the honour to call it the _Sciurus Tennentii_. Its dimensions are\r\nlarge, measuring upwards of two feet from head to tail. It is\r\ndistinguished from the _S. macrurus_ by the predominant black colour of\r\nthe upper surface of the body, with the exception of a rusty spot at the\r\nbase of the ears.]\r\n\r\nOne of the largest, belonging to a closely allied subgenus, is known as\r\nthe \"Flying Squirrel,\"[1] from its being assisted in its prodigious\r\nleaps from tree to tree, by the parachute formed by the skin of the\r\nflanks, which on the extension of the limbs front and rear, is laterally\r\nexpanded from foot to foot. Thus buoyed up in its descent, the spring\r\nwhich it is enabled to make from one lofty tree to another resembles the\r\nflight of a bird rather than the bound of a quadruped. Of these pretty\r\ncreatures there are two species, one common to Ceylon and India, the\r\nother (_Sciuropterus Layardii_, Kelaart) is peculiar to the island, and\r\nis by far the most beautiful of the family.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pteromys oral., _Tickel_. P. petaurista, _Pallas_.]\r\n\r\n_Rats_.--Among the multifarious inhabitants to which the forest affords\r\nat once a home and provender is the tree rat[1], which forms its nest on\r\nthe branches, and by turns makes its visits to the dwellings of the\r\nnatives, frequenting the ceilings in preference to the lower parts of\r\nhouses. Here it is incessantly followed by the rat-snake[2], whose\r\ndomestication is encouraged by the native servants, in consideration of\r\nits services in destroying vermin. I had one day an opportunity of\r\nsurprising a snake which had just seized on a rat of this description,\r\nand of covering it suddenly with a glass shade, before it had time to\r\nswallow its prey. The serpent, which appeared stunned by its own\r\ncapture, allowed the rat to escape from its jaws, which cowered at one\r\nside of the glass in the most pitiable state of trembling terror. The\r\ntwo were left alone for some moments, and on my return to them the snake\r\nwas as before in the same attitude of sullen stupor. On setting them at\r\nliberty, the rat bounded towards the nearest fence; but quick as\r\nlightning it was followed by its pursuer, which seized it before it\r\ncould gain the hedge, through which I saw the snake glide with its\r\nvictim in its jaws.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There are two species of the tree rat in Ceylon: M.\r\nrufescens, _Gray_; (M. flavescens; _Elliot_;) and Mus nemoralis,\r\n_Blyth_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Coryphodon Blumenbachii.]\r\n\r\nAnother indigenous variety of the rat is that which made its appearance\r\nfor the first time in the coffee plantations on the Kandyan hills in the\r\nyear 1847, and in such swarms does it infest them, that as many as a\r\nthousand have been killed in a single day on one estate. In order to\r\nreach the buds and blossoms of the coffee, it cuts such slender\r\nbranches, as would not sustain its weight, and feeds as they fall to the\r\nground; and so delicate and sharp are its incisors, that the twigs thus\r\ndestroyed are detached by as clean a cut as if severed with a knife. The\r\ncoffee-rat[1] is an insular variety of the _Mus hirsutus_ of W. Elliot,\r\nfound in Southern India. They inhabit the forests, making their nests\r\namong the roots of the trees, and like the lemmings of Norway and\r\nLapland, they migrate in vast numbers on the occurrence of a scarcity of\r\ntheir ordinary food. The Malabar coolies are so fond of their flesh,\r\nthat they evince a preference for those districts in which the coffee\r\nplantations are subject to these incursions, where they fry the rats in\r\noil, or convert them into curry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Golunda Ellioti, _Gray_.]\r\n\r\n_Bandicoot_.--Another favourite article of food with the coolies is the\r\npig-rat or Bandicoot[1], which attains on those hills the weight of two\r\nor three pounds, and grows to nearly the length of two feet. As it feeds\r\non grain and roots, its flesh is said to be delicate, and much\r\nresembling young pork. Its nests, when rifled, are frequently found to\r\ncontain considerable quantities of rice, stored up against the dry\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mus bandicota, _Beckst_. The English term bandicoot is a\r\ncorruption of the Telinga name _pandikoku_, literally _pig-rat_.]\r\n\r\n_Porcupine_.--The Porcupine[1] is another of the _rodentia_ which has\r\ndrawn down upon itself the hostility of the planters, from its\r\ndestruction of the young coco-nut palms, to which it is a pernicious and\r\npersevering, but withal so crafty, a visitor, that it is with difficulty\r\nany trap can be so disguised, or any bait made so alluring, as to lead\r\nto its capture. The usual expedient is to place some of its favourite\r\nfood at the extremity of a trench, so narrow as to prevent the porcupine\r\nturning, whilst the direction of his quills effectually bars his\r\nretreat. On a newly planted coco-nut tope, at Hang-welle, within a few\r\nmiles of Colombo, I have heard of as many as twenty-seven being thus\r\ncaptured in a single night; but such success is rare. The more ordinary\r\nexpedient is to smoke them out by burning straw at the apertures of\r\ntheir burrows. The flesh is esteemed a delicacy in Ceylon, and in\r\nconsistency, colour, and flavour, it very much resembles that of a young\r\npig.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Hystrix leucurus, _Sykes_.]\r\n\r\nV. EDENTATA, _Pengolin._--Of the _Edentata_ the only example in Ceylon\r\nis the scaly ant-eater, called by the Singhalese, Caballaya, but usually\r\nknown by its Malay name of _Pengolin_[1], a word indicative of its\r\nfaculty of \"rolling itself up\" into a compact ball, by bending its head\r\ntowards its stomach, arching its back into a circle, and securing all by\r\na powerful fold of its mail-covered tail. The feet of the pengolin are\r\narmed with powerful claws, which they double in in walking like the\r\nant-eater of Brazil. These they use in extracting their favourite food,\r\nthe termites, from ant-hills and decaying wood. When at liberty, they\r\nburrow in the dry ground to a depth of seven or eight feet, where they\r\nreside in pairs, and produce annually one or two young.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Manis pentadactyla, _Linn._]\r\n\r\nOf two specimens which I kept alive at different times, one from the\r\nvicinity of Kandy, about two feet in length, was a gentle and\r\naffectionate creature, which, after wandering over the house in search\r\nof ants, would attract attention to its wants by climbing up my knee,\r\nlaying hold of my leg with its prehensile tail. The other, more than\r\ndouble that length, was caught in the jungle near Chilaw, and brought to\r\nme in Colombo. I had always understood that the pengolin was unable to\r\nclimb trees; but the one last mentioned frequently ascended a tree in my\r\ngarden, in search of ants, and this it effected by means of its hooked\r\nfeet, aided by an oblique grasp of the tail. The ants it seized by\r\nextending its round and glutinous tongue along their tracks. In both,\r\nthe scales of the back were a cream-coloured white, with a tinge of red\r\nin the specimen which came from Chilaw, probably acquired by the\r\ninsinuation of the Cabook dust which abounds along the western coast of\r\nthe island. Generally speaking, they were quiet during the day, and grew\r\nrestless as evening and night approached.\r\n\r\nVI. RUMINATA. _The Gaur._--Besides the deer and some varieties of the\r\nhumped ox, which have been introduced from the opposite continent of\r\nIndia, Ceylon has probably but one other indigenous _ruminant_., the\r\nbuffalo.[1] There is a tradition that the gaur, found in the extremity\r\nof the Indian peninsula, was at one period a native of the Kandyan\r\nmountains; but as Knox speaks of one which in his time \"was kept among\r\nthe king's creatures\" at Kandy[2], and his account of it tallies with\r\nthat of the _Bos Gaurus_ of Hindustan, it would appear even then to have\r\nbeen a rarity. A place between Neuera-ellia and Adam's Peak bears the\r\nname of Gowra-ellia, and it is not impossible that the animal may yet be\r\ndiscovered in some of the imperfectly explored regions of the island.[3]\r\nI have heard of an instance in which a very old Kandyan, residing in the\r\nmountains near the Horton Plains, asserted that when young he had seen\r\nwhat he believed to have been a gaur, and which he described as between\r\nan elk and a buffalo in size, dark brown in colour, and very scantily\r\nprovided with hair.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Bubalus buffelus; _Gray_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Historical Relation of Ceylon, &c._, A.D. 1681. Book i. c,\r\n6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: KELAART, _Fauna Zeylan_., p. 87.]\r\n\r\n_Oxen_.--Oxen are used by the peasantry both in ploughing and in\r\ntempering the mud in the wet paddi fields before sowing the rice; and\r\nwhen the harvest is reaped they \"tread out the corn,\" after the\r\nimmemorial custom of the East. The wealth of the native chiefs and\r\nlanded proprietors frequently consists in their herds of bullocks, which\r\nthey hire out to their dependents during the seasons for agricultural\r\nlabour; and as they already supply them with land to be tilled, and lend\r\nthe seed which is to crop it, the further contribution of this portion\r\nof the labour serves to render the dependence of the peasantry on the\r\nchiefs and head-men complete.\r\n\r\nThe cows are worked equally with the oxen; and as the calves are always\r\npermitted to suck them, milk is an article which the traveller can\r\nrarely hope to procure in a Kandyan village. From their constant\r\nexposure at all seasons, the cattle in Ceylon, both those employed in\r\nagriculture and on the roads, are subject to the most devastating\r\nmurrains, which sweep them away by thousands. So frequent is the\r\nrecurrence of these calamities, and so extended their ravages, that they\r\nexercise a serious influence over the commercial interests of the\r\ncolony, by reducing the facilities of agriculture, and augmenting the\r\ncost of carriage during the most critical periods of the coffee season.\r\n\r\nA similar disorder, probably peripneumonia, frequently carries off the\r\ncattle in Assam and other hill countries on the continent of India; and\r\nthere, as in Ceylon, the inflammatory symptoms in the lungs and throat,\r\nand the internal derangement and external eruptive appearances, seem to\r\nindicate that the disease is a feverish influenza, attributable to\r\nneglect and exposure in a moist and variable climate; and that its\r\nprevention might be hoped for, and the cattle preserved by the simple\r\nexpedient of more humane and considerate treatment, especially by\r\naffording them cover at night.\r\n\r\nDuring my residence in Ceylon an incident occurred at Neuera-ellia,\r\nwhich invested one of these pretty animals with an heroic interest. A\r\nlittle cow, belonging to an English gentleman, was housed, together with\r\nher calf, near the dwelling of her owner, and being aroused during the\r\nnight by her furious bellowing, the servants, on hastening to the stall,\r\nfound her goring a leopard, which had stolen in to attack the calf. She\r\nhad got him into a corner, and whilst lowing incessantly to call for\r\nhelp, she continued to pound him with her horns. The wild animal,\r\napparently stupified by her unexpected violence, was detained by her\r\ntill despatched by a gun.\r\n\r\n_The Buffalo_.--Buffaloes abound in all parts of Ceylon, but they are\r\nonly to be seen in their native wildness in the vast solitudes of the\r\nnorthern and eastern provinces, where rivers, lagoons, and dilapidated\r\ntanks abound. In these they delight to immerse themselves, till only\r\ntheir heads appear above the surface; or, enveloped in mud to protect\r\nthemselves from the assaults of insects, luxuriate in the long sedges by\r\nthe water margins.\r\n\r\nWhen the buffalo is browsing, a crow will frequently be seen stationed\r\non his back, engaged in freeing it from the ticks and other pests which\r\nattach themselves to his leathery hide, the smooth brown surface of\r\nwhich, unprotected by hair, shines with an unpleasant polish in the\r\nsunlight. When in motion he throws back his clumsy head till the huge\r\nhorns rest on his shoulders, and the nose is presented in a line with\r\nthe eyes. When wild they are at all times uncertain in disposition, but\r\nso frequently savage that it is never quite safe to approach them, if\r\ndisturbed in their pasture or alarmed from their repose in the shallow\r\nlakes. On such occasions they hurry into line, draw up in defensive\r\narray, with a few of the oldest bulls in advance; and, wheeling in\r\ncircles, their horns clashing with a loud sound as they clank them\r\ntogether in their rapid evolutions, the herd betakes itself to flight.\r\nThen forming again at a safer distance, they halt as before, elevating\r\ntheir nostrils, and throwing back their heads to take a cautious survey\r\nof the intruders. The sportsman rarely molests them, so huge a creature\r\naffording no worthy mark for his skill, and their wanton slaughter\r\nadding nothing to the supply of food for their assailant.\r\n\r\nIn the Hambangtotte country, where the Singhalese domesticate the\r\nbuffaloes, and use them to assist in the labour of the rice lands, the\r\nvillagers are much annoyed by the wild ones, which mingle with the tame\r\nwhen sent out to the woods to pasture; and it constantly happens that a\r\nsavage stranger, placing himself at the head of the tame herd, resists\r\nthe attempts of the owners to drive them homewards at sunset. In the\r\ndistricts of Putlam and the Seven Corles, buffaloes are generally used\r\nfor draught; and in carrying heavy loads of salt from the coast towards\r\nthe interior, they drag a cart over roads which would defy the weaker\r\nstrength of bullocks.\r\n\r\nIn one place between Batticaloa and Trincomalie I found the natives\r\nmaking an ingenious use of them when engaged in shooting water-fowl in\r\nthe vast salt marshes and muddy lakes. Being an object to which the\r\nbirds are accustomed, the Singhalese train the buffalo to the sport,\r\nand, concealed behind, the animal browsing listlessly along, they guide\r\nit by ropes attached to its horns, and thus creep undiscovered within\r\nshot of the flock. The same practice prevails, I believe, in some of the\r\nnorthern parts of India, where they are similarly trained to assist the\r\nsportsman in approaching deer. One of these \"sporting buffaloes\" sells\r\nfor a considerable sum.\r\n\r\nThe buffalo, like the elk, is sometimes found in Ceylon as an albino,\r\nwith purely white hair and pink iris. There is a peculiarity in the\r\nformation of its foot, which, though it must have attracted attention, I\r\nhave never seen mentioned by naturalists. It is equivalent to an\r\narrangement that distinguishes the foot of the reindeer from that of the\r\nstag and the antelope. In them, the hoofs, being constructed for\r\nlightness and flight, are compact and vertical; but, in the reindeer,\r\nthe joints of the tarsal bones admit of lateral expansion, and the broad\r\nhoofs curve upwards in front, while the two secondary ones behind (which\r\nare but slightly developed in the fallow deer and others of the same\r\nfamily) are prolonged till, in certain positions, they are capable of\r\nbeing applied to the ground, thus adding to the circumference and\r\nsustaining power of the foot. It has been usually suggested as the\r\nprobable design of this structure, that it is to enable the reindeer to\r\nshovel under the snow in order to reach the lichens beneath it; but I\r\napprehend that another use of it has been overlooked, that of\r\nfacilitating its movements in search of food by increasing the\r\ndifficulty of its sinking in the snow.\r\n\r\nA formation precisely analogous in the buffalo seems to point to a\r\ncorresponding design. The ox, whose life is spent on firm ground, has\r\nthe bones of the foot so constructed as to afford the most solid support\r\nto an animal of its great weight; but in the buffalo, which delights in\r\nthe morasses on the margins of pools and rivers, the formation of the\r\nfoot resembles that of the reindeer. The tarsi in front extend almost\r\nhorizontally from the upright bones of the leg, and spread widely on\r\ntouching the ground; the hoofs are flattened and broad, with the\r\nextremities turned upwards; and the false hoofs descend behind till, in\r\nwalking, they make a clattering sound. In traversing the marshes, this\r\ncombination of abnormal incidents serves to give extraordinary breadth\r\nto the foot, and not only prevents the buffalo from sinking\r\ninconveniently in soft ground[1], but at the same time presents no\r\nobstacle to the withdrawal of his foot from the mud.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: PROFESSOR OWEN has noticed a similar fact regarding the\r\nrudiments of the second and fifth digits in the instance of the elk and\r\nbison, which have them largely expanded where they inhabit swampy\r\nground; whilst they are nearly obliterated in the camel and dromedary,\r\nwhich traverse arid deserts.--OWEN _on Limbs_, p. 34; see also BELL _on\r\nthe Hand_, ch. iii.]\r\n\r\n_Deer_.--\"Deer,\" says the truthful old chronicler, Robert Knox, \"are in\r\ngreat abundance in the woods, from the largeness of a cow to the\r\nsmallness of a hare, for here is a creature in this land no bigger than\r\nthe latter, though every part rightly resembleth a deer: it is called\r\n_meminna_, of a grey colour, with white spots and good meat.\"[1] The\r\nlittle creature which thus dwelt in the recollection of the old man, as\r\none of the memorials of his long captivity, is the small \"musk deer\"[2]\r\nso called in India, although neither sex is provided with a musk-bag;\r\nand the Europeans in Ceylon know it by the name of the moose deer. Its\r\nextreme length never reaches two feet; and of those which were\r\ndomesticated about my house, few exceeded ten inches in height, their\r\ngraceful limbs being of similar delicate proportion. It possesses long\r\nand extremely large tusks, with which it inflicts a severe bite. The\r\ninterpreter moodliar of Negombo had a _milk white_ meminna in 1847,\r\nwhich he designed to send home as an acceptable present to Her Majesty,\r\nbut it was unfortunately killed by an accident.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: KNOX'S _Relation, &c_., book i. c. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Moschus meminna.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: When the English took possession of Kandy, in 1803, they\r\nfound \"five beautiful milk-white deer in the palace, which was noted as\r\na very extraordinary thing.\"--_Letter_ in Appendix to PERCIVAL'S\r\n_Ceylon_, p. 428. The writer does not say of what species they were.]\r\n\r\n_Ceylon Elk_.--In the mountains, the Ceylon elk[1], which reminds one of\r\nthe red deer of Scotland, attains the height of four or five feet; it\r\nabounds in all places which are intersected by shady rivers; where,\r\nthough its hunting affords an endless resource to the sportsmen, its\r\nvenison scarcely equals in quality the inferior beef of the lowland ox.\r\nIn the glades and park-like openings that diversify the great forests of\r\nthe interior, the spotted Axis troops in herds as numerous as the fallow\r\ndeer in England; and, in journeys through the jungle, when often\r\ndependent on the guns of our party for the precarious supply of the\r\ntable, we found the flesh of the Axis[2] and the Muntjac[3] a sorry\r\nsubstitute for that of the pea-fowl, the jungle-cock, and flamingo. The\r\noccurrence of albinos is very frequent in troops of the axis. Deer's\r\nhorns are an article of export from Ceylon, and considerable quantities\r\nare annually sent to the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Rusa Aristotelis. Dr. GRAY has lately shown that this is\r\nthe great _axis_ of Cuvier.--_Oss. Foss._ 502, t. 39, f. 10. The\r\nSinghalese, on following the elk, frequently effect their approaches by\r\nso imitating the call of the animal as to induce them to respond. An\r\ninstance occurred during my residence in Ceylon, in which two natives,\r\nwhose mimicry had mutually deceived them, crept so close together in the\r\njungle that one shot the other, supposing the cry to proceed from the\r\ngame.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Axis maculata, _H. Smith_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Stylocerus muntjac, _Horsf_.]\r\n\r\nVII. PACHYDERMATA. _The Elephant._--The elephant and the wild boar, the\r\nSinghalese \"waloora,\" are the only representatives of the\r\n_pachydermatous_ order. The latter, which differs in no respect from the\r\nwild boar of India, is found in droves in all parts of the island where\r\nvegetation and water are abundant. The elephant, the lord paramount of\r\nthe Ceylon forests, is to be met with in every district, on the confines\r\nof the woods, in whose depths he finds concealment and shade during the\r\nhours when the sun is high, and from which he emerges only at twilight\r\nto wend his way towards the rivers and tanks, where he luxuriates till\r\ndawn, when he again seeks the retirement of the deep forests. This noble\r\nanimal fills so dignified a place both in the zoology and oeconomy of\r\nCeylon, and his habits in a state of nature have been so much\r\nmisunderstood, that I shall devote a separate section to his defence\r\nfrom misrepresentation, and to an exposition of what, from observation\r\nand experience, I believe to be his genuine character when free in his\r\nnative domains.\r\n\r\nVIII. CETACEA.--Among the Cetacea the occurrence of the Dugong[1] on\r\nvarious points of the coast, and especially on the western side of the\r\nisland, will be noticed elsewhere; and whales are so frequently seen\r\nthat they have been captured within sight of Colombo, and more than once\r\ntheir carcases, after having been flinched by the whalers, have floated\r\non shore near the light-house, tainting the atmosphere within the fort\r\nby their rapid decomposition.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Halicore dugong_, F. Cuv.]\r\n\r\nFrom this sketch of the Mammalia it will be seen that, in its general\r\nfeatures, this branch of the Fauna bears a striking resemblance to that\r\nof Southern India, although many of the larger animals of the latter are\r\nunknown in Ceylon; and, on the other hand, some species discovered there\r\nare altogether peculiar to the island. A deer[1] as large as the Axis,\r\nbut differing from it in the number and arrangement of its spots, has\r\nbeen described by Dr. Kelaart, to whose vigilance the natural history of\r\nCeylon is indebted, amongst others, for the identification of two new\r\nspecies of monkeys[2], a number of curious shrews[3], and an\r\norange-coloured ichneumon[4], before unknown. There are also two\r\ndescriptions of squirrels[5] that have not as yet been discovered\r\nelsewhere, one of them belonging to those equipped with a parachute[6],\r\nas well as some local varieties of the palm squirrel (Sciurus\r\npenicillatus, _Leach_).[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Cervus orizus, KELAART, _Prod. F. Zeyl_., p. 83.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Presbytes ursinus, _Blyth_, and P. Thersites, _Elliot_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Sorex montanus, S. ferrugineus, and Feroculus macropus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Herpestes fulvescens, KELAART, _Prod. Fann.

Dr. TEMPLETON has noticed a little shrew (Corsira purpurascens,\r\n_Mag. Nat. Hist_. 1855, p. 238) at Neuera-ellia, not as yet observed\r\nelsewhere.]\r\n\r\nBut the Ceylon Mammalia, besides wanting a number of minor animals found\r\nin the Indian peninsula, cannot boast such a ruminant as the majestic\r\nGaur[1], which inhabits the great forests from Cape Comorin to the\r\nHimalaya; and, providentially, the island is equally free of the\r\nformidable tiger and the ferocious wolf of Hindustan.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Bos cavifrons, _Hodgs_, B. frontalis, _Lamb_.]\r\n\r\nThe Hyena and Cheetah[1], common in Southern India, are unknown in\r\nCeylon; and though abundant in deer, the island possesses no example of\r\nthe Antelope or the Gazelle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Felis jubata, _Schreb_.]\r\n\r\n_List of Ceylon Mammalia._\r\n\r\nA list of the Mammalia of Ceylon is subjoined. In framing it, as well as\r\nthe lists appended to other chapters on the Fauna of the island, the\r\nprincipal object in view has been to exhibit the extent to which its\r\nnatural history had been investigated, and collections made up to the\r\nperiod of my leaving the colony in 1850. It has been considered\r\nexpedient to exclude a few individuals which have not had the advantage\r\nof a direct comparison with authentic specimens, either at Calcutta or\r\nin England. This will account for the omission of a number which have\r\nappeared in other catalogues, but of which many, though ascertained to\r\nexist, have not been submitted to this rigorous process of\r\nidentification.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the species of mammals and birds contained in\r\nthese lists will be found, with suitable references to the most accurate\r\ndescriptions, in the admirable catalogue of the collection at the India\r\nHouse, now in course of publication under the care of Dr. Horsfield.\r\nThis work cannot be too highly extolled, not alone for the scrupulous\r\nfidelity with which the description of each species is referred to its\r\nfirst discoverer, but also for the pains which have been taken to\r\nelaborate synonymes and to collate from local periodicals and other\r\nsources, little accessible to ordinary inquirers, such incidents and\r\ntraits as are calculated to illustrate characteristics and habits.\r\n\r\nQuadrumana.\r\n\r\nPresbytes cephalopterus, _Zimm_.\r\n  ursinus, _Blyth_.\r\n  Priamus, _Elliot_ & _Blyth_.\r\n  Thersites, _Blyth_.\r\nMacacus pileatus, _Shaw_ & _Desm_.\r\nLoris gracilis, _Geoff_.\r\n\r\nCheiroptera.\r\n\r\nPteropus Edwardsii, _Geoff_.\r\n  Leschenaultii, _Dum_.\r\nCynopterus marginatus, _Hamilt_.\r\nMegaderma spasma, _Linn_.\r\n  lyra, _Geoff_.\r\nRhinolophus _affinis, Horsf_.\r\nHipposideros murinus, _Elliot_.\r\n  speoris, _Elliot_.\r\n  armiger, _Hodgs_.\r\n  vulgaris, _Horsf_.\r\nKerivoula picta, _Pall_.\r\nTaphozous longimanus, _Hardw_.\r\nScotophilus Coromandelicus, _F.

Cuv_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE (A.)\r\n\r\n_Parasite of the Bat_.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious peculiarities connected with the bats is their\r\nsingular parasite, the Nycteribia.[1] On cursory observation, this\r\ncreature appears to have neither head, antennæ, eyes, nor mouth; and the\r\nearlier observers of its structure assured themselves that the place of\r\nthe latter was supplied by a cylindrical sucker, which, being placed\r\nbetween the shoulders, the creature had no option but to turn on its\r\nback to feed. This apparent inconvenience was thought to have been\r\ncompensated for by another anomaly: its three pairs of legs, armed with\r\nclaws, being so arranged that they seemed to be equally distributed over\r\nits upper and under sides, the creature being thus enabled to use them\r\nlike hands, and to grasp the strong hairs above it while extracting its\r\nnourishment. It moves by rolling itself rapidly along, rotating like a\r\nwheel on the extremities of its spokes, or like the clown in a pantomime\r\nhurling himself forward on hands and feet alternately. Its celerity is\r\nso great that Colonel Montague, who was one of the first to describe it\r\nminutely[2], says its speed exceeds that of any known insect, and as its\r\njoints are so flexible as to yield in every direction (like what\r\nmechanics call a \"ball and socket\"), its motions are exceedingly\r\ngrotesque as it tumbles through the fur of the bat.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This extraordinary creature had formerly been discovered\r\nonly on a few European bats. Joinville figured one which he found on the\r\nlarge roussette (the flying-fox), and says he had seen another on a bat\r\nof the same family. Dr. Templeton observed them in Ceylon in great\r\nabundance on the fur of the _Scotophilus Coromandelicus_, and they will,\r\nno doubt, be found on many others.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Celeripes vespertilionis, _Mont. Lin. Trans_, xi. p. 11.]\r\n\r\nTo enable it to attain its marvellous velocity, each foot is armed with\r\ntwo sharp hooks, with elastic pads opposed to them, so that the hair can\r\nnot only be rapidly seized and firmly held, but as quickly disengaged as\r\nthe creature whirls away in its headlong career.\r\n\r\nThe insects to which it hears the nearest affinity are the\r\n_Hippoboscidæ_ or \"spider flies,\" that infest birds and horses, but,\r\nunlike them, it is unable to fly.\r\n\r\nIts strangest peculiarity, and that which gave rise to the belief that\r\nit is headless, is its faculty when at rest of throwing back its head\r\nand pressing it close between its shoulders till the under side becomes\r\nuppermost, not a vestige of head being discernible where we would\r\nnaturally look for it, and the whole seeming but a casual inequality on\r\nits back.\r\n\r\nOn closer examination this apparent tubercle is found to have a leathery\r\nattachment like a flexible neck, and by a sudden jerk the little\r\ncreature is enabled to project it forward into its normal position, when\r\nit is discovered to be furnished with a mouth, antennæ, and four eyes,\r\ntwo on each side.\r\n\r\nThe organisation of such an insect is a marvellous adaptation of\r\nphysical form to special circumstances. As the nycteribia has to make\r\nits way through fur and hairs, its feet are furnished with prehensile\r\nhooks that almost convert them into hands; and being obliged to conform\r\nto the sudden flights of its patron, and accommodate itself to inverted\r\npositions, all attitudes are rendered alike to it by the arrangement of\r\nits limbs, which enables it, after every possible gyration, to find\r\nitself always on its feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nBIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the _Birds_ of the island, upwards of three hundred and twenty\r\nspecies have been indicated, for which we are indebted to the\r\npersevering labours of Dr. Templeton, Dr. Kelaart, and Mr. Layard; but\r\nmany yet remain to be identified. In fact, to the eye of a stranger,\r\ntheir prodigious numbers, and especially the myriads of waterfowl which,\r\nnotwithstanding the presence of the crocodiles, people the lakes and\r\nmarshes in the eastern provinces, form one of the marvels of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nIn the glory of their plumage, the birds of the interior are surpassed\r\nby those of South America and Northern India; and the melody of their\r\nsong will bear no comparison with that of the warblers of Europe, but\r\nthe want of brilliancy is compensated by their singular grace of form,\r\nand the absence of prolonged and modulated harmony by the rich and\r\nmelodious tones of their clear and musical calls. In the elevations of\r\nthe Kandyan country there are a few, such as the robin of\r\nNeuera-ellia[1] and the long-tailed thrush[2], whose song rivals that of\r\ntheir European namesakes; but, far beyond the attraction of their notes,\r\nthe traveller rejoices in the flute-like voices of the Oriole, the\r\nDayal-bird[3], and some others equally charming; when, at the first dawn\r\nof day, they wake the forest with their clear _reveille_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pratincola atrata, _Kelaart_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Kittacincla macroura, _Gm_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Copsychus saularis, _Linn_. Called by the Europeans in\r\nCeylon the \"Magpie Robin.\" This is not to be confounded with the other\r\npopular favourite, the \"Indian Robin\" (Thamnobia fulicata, _Linn_.),\r\nwhich is \"never seen in the unfrequented jungle, but, like the coco-nut\r\npalm, which the Singhalese assert will only flourish within the sound of\r\nthe human voice, it is always found near the habitations of men.\"--E.L.\r\nLAYARD.]\r\n\r\nIt is only on emerging from the dense forests, and coming into the\r\nvicinity of the lakes and pasture of the low country, that birds become\r\nvisible in great quantities. In the close jungle one occasionally hears\r\nthe call of the copper-smith[1], or the strokes of the great\r\norange-coloured woodpecker[2] as it beats the decaying trees in search\r\nof insects, whilst clinging to the bark with its finely-pointed claws,\r\nand leaning for support upon the short stiff feathers of its tail. And\r\non the lofty branches of the higher trees, the hornbill[3] (the toucan\r\nof the East), with its enormous double casque, sits to watch the motions\r\nof the tiny reptiles and smaller birds on which it preys, tossing them\r\ninto the air when seized, and catching them in its gigantic mandibles as\r\nthey fall.[4] The remarkable excrescence on the beak of this\r\nextraordinary bird may serve to explain the statement of the Minorite\r\nfriar Odoric, of Portenau in Friuli, who travelled in Ceylon in the\r\nfourteenth century, and brought suspicion on the veracity of his\r\nnarrative by asserting that he had there seen \"_birds with two\r\nheads_.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The greater red-headed Barbet (Megalaima indica, _Lath_.;\r\nM. Philippensis, _var. A. Lath_.), the incessant din of which resembles\r\nthe blows of a smith hammering a cauldron.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Brachypternus aurantius, _Linn_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Buceros pica, _Scop_.; B. coronata, _Bodd_. The natives\r\nassert that B. pica builds in holes in the trees, and that when\r\nincubation has fairly commenced, the female takes her seat on the eggs,\r\nand the male closes up the orifice by which she entered, leaving only a\r\nsmall aperture through which he feeds his partner, whilst she\r\nsuccessfully guards their treasures from the monkey tribes; her\r\nformidable bill nearly filling the entire entrance. See a paper by Edgar\r\nL. Layard, Esq. _Mag. Nat. Hist._ March, 1853. Dr. Horsfield had\r\npreviously observed the same habit in a species of Buceros in Java. (See\r\nHORSFIELD and MOORE'S _Catal. Birds_, E.I. Comp. Mus. vol. ii.) It is\r\ncurious that a similar trait, though necessarily from very different\r\ninstincts, is exhibited by the termites, who literally build a cell\r\nround the great progenitrix of the community, and feed her through\r\napertures.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The hornbill is also frugivorous, and the natives assert\r\nthat when endeavouring to detach a fruit, if the stem is too tough to be\r\nsevered by his mandibles, he flings himself off the branch so as to add\r\nthe weight of his body to the pressure of his beak. The hornbill abounds\r\nin Cuttack, and bears there the name of \"Kuchila-Kai,\" or Kuchila-eater,\r\nfrom its partiality for the fruit of the Strychnus nux-vomica. The\r\nnatives regard its flesh as a sovereign specific for rheumatic\r\naffections.--_Asiat. Res._ ch. xv. p. 184.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Itinerarius_ FRATRIS ODORICI, de Foro Julii de\r\nPortu-vahonis.--HAKLUYT, vol. ii. p. 39.]\r\n\r\nAs we emerge from the deep shade and approach the park-like openings on\r\nthe verge of the low country, quantities of pea-fowl are to be found\r\neither feeding amongst the seeds and nuts in the long grass or sunning\r\nthemselves on the branches of the surrounding trees. Nothing to be met\r\nwith in demesnes in England can give an adequate idea either of the size\r\nor the magnificence of this matchless bird when seen in his native\r\nsolitudes. Here he generally selects some projecting branch, from which\r\nhis plumage may hang free of the foliage, and, if there be a dead and\r\nleafless bough, he is certain to choose it for his resting-place, whence\r\nhe droops his wings and suspends his gorgeous train, or spreads it in\r\nthe morning sun to drive off the damps and dews of the night.\r\n\r\nIn some of the unfrequented portions of the eastern province, to which\r\nEuropeans rarely resort, and where the pea-fowl are unmolested by the\r\nnatives, their number is so extraordinary that, regarded as game, it\r\nceases to be a \"sport\" to destroy them; and their cries at early morning\r\nare so tumultuous and incessant as to banish sleep, and amount to an\r\nactual inconvenience. Their flesh is excellent when served up hot,\r\nthough it is said to be indigestible; but, when cold, it contracts a\r\nreddish and disagreeable tinge.\r\n\r\nBut of all, the most astonishing in point of multitude, as well as the\r\nmost interesting from their endless variety, are the myriads of aquatic\r\nbirds and waders which frequent the lakes and watercourses; especially\r\nthose along the coast near Batticaloa, between the mainland and the sand\r\nformations of the shore, and the innumerable salt marshes and lagoons to\r\nthe south of Trincomalie. These, and the profusion of perching birds,\r\nfly-catchers, finches, and thrushes, which appear in the open country,\r\nafford sufficient quarry for the raptorial and predatory\r\nspecies--eagles, hawks, and falcons--whose daring sweeps and effortless\r\nundulations are striking objects in the cloudless sky.\r\n\r\nI. ACCIPITRES. _Eagles_.--The Eagles, however, are small, and as\r\ncompared with other countries rare; except, perhaps, the crested\r\neagle[1], which haunts the mountain provinces and the lower hills,\r\ndisquieting the peasantry by its ravages amongst their poultry; and the\r\ngloomy serpent eagle[2], which, descending from its eyrie in the lofty\r\njungle, and uttering a loud and plaintive cry, sweeps cautiously around\r\nthe lonely tanks and marshes, where it feeds upon the reptiles on their\r\nmargin. The largest eagle is the great sea Erne[3], seen on the northern\r\ncoasts and the salt lakes of the eastern provinces, particularly when\r\nthe receding tide leaves bare an expanse of beach, over which it hunts,\r\nin company with the fishing eagle[4], sacred to Siva. Unlike its\r\ncompanions, however, the sea eagle rejects garbage for living prey, and\r\nespecially for the sea snakes which abound on the northern coasts. These\r\nit seizes by descending with its wings half closed, and, suddenly\r\ndarting down its talons, it soars aloft again with its writhing\r\nvictim.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Spizaëtus limnaëtus, _Horsf_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Hæmatornis cheela, _Daud_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Pontoaetus leucogaster, _Gmel_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Haliastur indus, _Bodd_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: E.L. Layard. Europeans have given this bird the name of the\r\n\"Brahminy Kite,\" probably from observing the superstitious feeling of\r\nthe natives regarding it, who believe that when two armies are about to\r\nengage, its appearance prognosticates victory to the party over whom it\r\nhovers.]\r\n\r\n_Hawks_.--The beautiful Peregrine Falcon[1] is rare, but the Kestrel[2]\r\nis found almost universally; and the bold and daring Goshawk[3] wherever\r\nwild crags and precipices afford safe breeding places. In the district\r\nof Anarajapoora, where it is trained for hawking, it is usual, in lieu\r\nof a hood, to darken its eyes by means of a silken thread passed through\r\nholes in the eyelids. The ignoble birds of prey, the Kites[4], keep\r\nclose by the shore, and hover round the returning boats of the fishermen\r\nto feast on the fry rejected from their nets.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Falco peregrinus, _Linn_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Tinnunculus alaudarius, _Briss_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Astur trivirgatus, _Temm_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Milvus govinda, _Sykes_. Dr. Hamilton Buchanan remarks that\r\nwhen gorged this bird delights to sit on the entablature of buildings,\r\nexposing its back to the hottest rays of the sun, placing its breast\r\nagainst the wall, and stretching out its wings _exactly as the Egyptian\r\nHawk is represented on their monuments_.]\r\n\r\n_Owls_.--Of the nocturnal accipitres the most remarkable is the brown\r\nowl, which, from its hideous yell, has acquired the name of the\r\n\"Devil-Bird.\"[l] The Singhalese regard it literally with horror, and its\r\nscream by night in the vicinity of a village is bewailed as the\r\nharbinger of approaching calamity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Syrnium indranee, _Sykes_. The horror of this nocturnal\r\nscream was equally prevalent in the West as in the East. Ovid Introduces\r\nit in his _Fasti_, L. vi. 1. 139; and Tibullus in his Elegies, L.i. El\r\n5. Statius says--\r\n\r\n  \"Nocturnæ-que gemunt striges, et feralia bubo\r\n  _Danna canens_.\"      Theb. iii. I. 511.\r\n\r\nBut Pliny, 1. xi. c. 93, doubts as to what bird produced the sound; and\r\nthe details of Ovid's description do not apply to an owl.\r\n\r\nMr. Mitford, of the Ceylon Civil Service, to whom I am indebted for many\r\nvaluable notes relative to the birds of the island, regards the\r\nidentification of the Singhalese Devil-Bird as open to similar doubt: he\r\nsays--\"The Devil-Bird is not am owl. I never heard it until I came to\r\nKornegalle, where it haunts the rocky hill at the back of\r\nGovernment-House. Its ordinary note is a magnificent clear shout like\r\nthat of a human being, and which can be heard at a great distance, and\r\nhas a fine effect in the silence of the closing night. It has another\r\ncry like that of a hen just caught, but the sounds which have earned for\r\nit its bad name, and which I have heard but once to perfection, are\r\nindescribable, the most appalling that can be imagined, and scarcely to\r\nbe heard without shuddering; I can only compare it to a boy in torture,\r\nwhose screams are being stopped by being strangled. I have offered\r\nrewards for a specimen, but without success. The only European who had\r\nseen and fired at one agreed with the natives that it is of the size of\r\na pigeon, with a long tail. I believe it is a Podargus or Night Hawk,\"\r\nIn a subsequent note he further says--\"I have since seen two birds by\r\nmoonlight, one of the size and shape of a cuckoo, the other a large\r\nblack bird, which I imagine to be the one which gives these calls.\"]\r\n\r\nII. PASSERES. _Swallows_.--Within thirty-five miles of Caltura, on the\r\nwestern coast, are inland caves, the resort of the Esculent Swift[1],\r\nwhich there builds the \"edible bird's nest,\" so highly prized in China.\r\nNear the spot a few Chinese immigrants have established themselves, who\r\nrent the royalty from the government, and make an annual export of their\r\nproduce. But the Swifts are not confined to this district, and caves\r\ncontaining them have been found far in the interior, a fact which\r\ncomplicates the still unexplained mystery of the composition of their\r\nnest; and notwithstanding the power of wing possessed by these birds,\r\nadds something to the difficulty of believing that it consists of\r\nglutinous algæ.[2] In the nests brought to me there was no trace of\r\norganisation; and whatever may be the original material, it is so\r\nelaborated by the swallow as to present somewhat the appearance and\r\nconsistency of strings of isinglass. The quantity of these nests\r\nexported from Ceylon is trifling.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Collocalia brevirostris, _McClell_.; C. nidifica, _Gray_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: An epitome of what has been written on this subject will be\r\nfound in _Dr. Horsfield's Catalogue_ of the Birds in the E.I. Comp.\r\nMuseum, vol. i. p. 101, etc.]\r\n\r\n_Kingfishers_.--In solitary places, where no sound breaks the silence\r\nexcept the gurgle of the river as it sweeps round the rocks, the lonely\r\nKingfisher sits upon an overhanging branch, his turquoise plumage hardly\r\nless intense in its lustre than the deep blue of the sky above him; and\r\nso intent is his watch upon the passing fish that intrusion fails to\r\nscare him from his post; the emblem of vigilance and patience.\r\n\r\n_Sun Birds_.--In the gardens the Sun Birds[1] (known as the Humming\r\nBirds of Ceylon) hover all day long, attracted by the plants over which\r\nthey hang, poised on their glittering wings, and inserting their curved\r\nbeaks to extract the tiny insects that nestle in the flowers. Perhaps\r\nthe most graceful of the birds of Ceylon in form and motions, and the\r\nmost chaste in colouring, is that which Europeans call \"the Bird of\r\nParadise,\"[2] and the natives \"the Cotton Thief,\" from the circumstance\r\nthat its tail consists of two long white feathers, which stream behind\r\nit as it flies, Mr. Layard says:--\"I have often watched them, when\r\nseeking their insect prey, turn suddenly on their perch and _whisk their\r\nlong tails with a jerk_ over the bough, as if to protect them from\r\ninjury.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Nectarina Zeylanica, _Linn_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Tchitrea paradisi, _Linn_.]\r\n\r\n_The Bulbul_.--The _Condatchee Bulbul_[1], which, from the crest on its\r\nhead, is called by the Singhalese the \"Konda Coorola,\" or _Tuft bird_,\r\nis regarded by the natives as the most \"_game_\" of all birds; and the\r\ntraining it to fight was one of the duties entrusted by the Kings of\r\nKandy to the Kooroowa, or Bird Head-man. For this purpose the Bulbul is\r\ntaken from the nest as soon as the sex is distinguishable by the tufted\r\ncrown; and being secured by a string, is taught to fly from hand to hand\r\nof its keeper. When pitted against an antagonist, such is the obstinate\r\ncourage of this little creature that it will sink from exhaustion rather\r\nthan release its hold. This propensity, and the ordinary character of\r\nits notes, render it impossible that the Bulbul of India can be\r\nidentical with the Bulbul of Iran, the \"Bird of a Thousand Songs,\"[2] of\r\nwhich poets say that its delicate passion for the rose gives a plaintive\r\ncharacter to its note.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pycnonotus hæmorrhous, _Gmel_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _\"Hazardasitaum,\"_ the Persian name for the bulbul. \"The\r\nPersians,\" according to Zakary ben Mohamed al Caswini, \"say the bulbul\r\nhas a passion for the rose, and laments and cries when he sees it\r\npulled.\"--OUSELEY'S _Oriental Collections_, vol. i. p. 16. According to\r\nPallas it is the true nightingale of Europe, Sylvia luscinia, which the\r\nArmenians call _boulboul_, and the Crim-Tartars _byl-byl-i_.]\r\n\r\n_Tailor-Bird_.--_The Weaver-Bird_.--The tailor-bird[1] having completed\r\nher nest, sewing together the leaves by passing through them a cotton\r\nthread twisted by the creature herself, leaps from branch to branch to\r\ntestify her happiness by a clear and merry note; and the Indian\r\nweaver[2], a still more ingenious artist, having woven its dwelling with\r\ngrass something into the form of a bottle, with a prolonged neck, hangs\r\nit from a projecting branch with its entrance inverted so as to baffle\r\nthe approaches of its enemies, the tree snakes and other reptiles. The\r\nnatives assert that the male bird carries fire flies to the nest,\r\nfastening them to its sides by a particle of soft mud, and Mr. Layard\r\nassures me that although he has never succeeded in finding the fire fly,\r\nthe nest of the male bird (for the female occupies another during\r\nincubation) invariably contains a patch of mud on each side of the\r\nperch.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Orthotomus longicauda, _Gmel_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Ploceus baya, _Blyth_; P. Philippinus, _Auct_.]\r\n\r\n_Crows_.--Of all the Ceylon birds of this order the most familiar and\r\nnotorious is the small glossy crow, whose shining black plumage shot\r\nwith blue has obtained for him the title of _Corvus splendens_.[1] They\r\nfrequent the towns in companies, and domesticate themselves in the close\r\nvicinity of every house; and it may possibly serve to account for the\r\nfamiliarity and audacity which they exhibit in their intercourse with\r\nmen, that the Dutch during their sovereignty in Ceylon enforced severe\r\npenalties against any one killing a crow, under the belief that they are\r\ninstrumental in extending the growth of cinnamon by feeding on the\r\nfruit, and thus disseminating the undigested seed.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There is another species, the _C. culminatus_, so called\r\nfrom the convexity of its bill; but though seen in the towns, it lives\r\nchiefly in the open country, and may be constantly observed wherever\r\nthere are buffaloes, perched on their backs and engaged, in company with\r\nthe small Minah (_Acridotheres tristis_) in freeing them from ticks.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: WOLF'S _Life and Adventures_, p. 117.]\r\n\r\nSo accustomed are the natives to its presence and exploits, that, like\r\nthe Greeks and Romans, they have made the movements of the crow the\r\nbasis of their auguries; and there is no end to the vicissitudes of good\r\nand evil fortune which may not be predicted from the direction of their\r\nflight, the hoarse or mellow notes of their croaking, the variety of\r\ntrees on which they rest, and the numbers in which they are seen to\r\nassemble. All day long they are engaged in watching either the offal of\r\nthe offices, or the preparation for meals in the dining-room; and as\r\ndoors and windows are necessarily opened to relieve the heat, nothing is\r\nmore common than the passage of crows across the room, lifting on the\r\nwing some ill-guarded morsel from the dinner-table.\r\n\r\nNo article, however unpromising its quality, provided only it be\r\nportable, can with safety be left unguarded in any apartment accessible\r\nto them. The contents of ladies' work-boxes, kid gloves, and pocket\r\nhandkerchiefs vanish instantly if exposed near a window or open door.\r\nThey open paper parcels to ascertain the contents; they will undo the\r\nknot on a napkin if it encloses anything eatable, and I have known a\r\ncrow to extract the peg which fastened the lid of a basket in order to\r\nplunder the provender within.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a nurse seated in a garden adjoining a regimental\r\nmess-room, was terrified by seeing a bloody clasp-knife drop from the\r\nair at her feet; but the mystery was explained on learning that a crow,\r\nwhich had been watching the cook chopping mince-meat, had seized the\r\nmoment when his head was turned to carry off the knife.\r\n\r\nOne of these ingenious marauders, after vainly attitudinising in front\r\nof a chained watch-dog, which was lazily gnawing a bone, and after\r\nfruitlessly endeavouring to divert his attention by dancing before him,\r\nwith head awry and eye askance, at length flew away for a moment, and\r\nreturned bringing with it a companion who perched itself on a branch a\r\nfew yards in the rear. The crow's grimaces were now actively renewed,\r\nbut with no better result, till its confederate, poising himself on his\r\nwings, descended with the utmost velocity, striking the dog upon the\r\nspine with all the force of his beak. The _ruse_ was successful; the dog\r\nstarted with surprise and pain, but not quickly enough to seize his\r\nassailant, whilst the bone he had been gnawing disappeared the instant\r\nhis head was turned. Two well-authenticated instances of the recurrence\r\nof this device came within my knowledge at Colombo, and attest the\r\nsagacity and powers of communication and combination possessed by these\r\nastute and courageous birds.\r\n\r\nOn the approach of evening the crows assemble in noisy groups along the\r\nmargin of the fresh-water lake which surrounds Colombo on the eastern\r\nside; here for an hour or two they enjoy the luxury of the bath, tossing\r\nthe water over their shining backs, and arranging their plumage\r\ndecorously, after which they disperse, each taking the direction of his\r\naccustomed quarters for the night.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A similar habit has been noticed in the damask Parrots of\r\nAfrica (_Palæornis fuscus_), which daily resort at the same hour to\r\ntheir accustomed water to bathe.]\r\n\r\nDuring the storms which usher in the monsoon, it has been observed, that\r\nwhen coco-nut palms are struck by lightning, the destruction frequently\r\nextends beyond a single tree, and from the contiguity and conduction of\r\nthe spreading leaves, or some other peculiar cause, large groups will be\r\naffected by a single flash, a few killed instantly, and the rest doomed\r\nto rapid decay. In Belligam Bay, a little to the east of Point-de-Galle,\r\na small island, which is covered with coco-nuts, has acquired the name\r\nof \"Crow Island,\" from being the resort of those birds, which are seen\r\nhastening towards it in thousands towards sunset. A few years ago,\r\nduring a violent storm of thunder, such was the destruction of the crows\r\nthat the beach for some distance was covered with a black line of their\r\nremains, and the grove on which they had been resting was to a great\r\nextent destroyed by the same flash.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Similar instances are recorded in other countries of sudden\r\nmortality amongst crows to a prodigious extent, but whether occasioned\r\nby lightning seems uncertain. In 1839 thirty-three thousand dead crows\r\nwere found on the shores of a lake in the county Westmeath in Ireland\r\nafter a storm.--THOMPSON'S _Nat. Hist. Ireland_, vol. i. p. 319, and\r\nPatterson in his Zoology, p. 356, mentions other cases.]\r\n\r\nIII. SCANSORES. _Parroquets_.--Of the Psittacidæ the only examples are\r\nthe parroquets, of which the most renowned is the _Palæornis Alexandri_,\r\nwhich has the historic distinction of bearing the name of the great\r\nconquerer of India, having been the first of its race introduced to the\r\nknowledge of Europe on the return of his expedition. An idea of their\r\nnumber may be formed from the following statement of Mr. Layard, as to\r\nthe multitudes which are found on the western coast. \"At Chilaw I have\r\nseen such vast flights of parroquets coming to roost in the coco-nut\r\ntrees which overhang the bazaar, that their noise drowned the Babel of\r\ntongues bargaining for the evening provisions. Hearing of the swarms\r\nwhich resorted to this spot, I posted myself on a bridge some half mile\r\ndistant, and attempted to count the flocks which came from a single\r\ndirection to the eastward. About four o'clock in the afternoon,\r\nstraggling parties began to wend towards home, and in the course of half\r\nan hour the current fairly set in. But I soon found that I had no longer\r\ndistinct flocks to count, it became one living screaming stream. Some\r\nflew high in the air till right above their homes, and dived abruptly\r\ndownward with many evolutions till on a level with the trees; others\r\nkept along the ground and dashed close by my face with the rapidity of\r\nthought, their brilliant plumage shining with an exquisite lustre in the\r\nsun-light. I waited on the spot till the evening closed, when I could\r\nhear, though no longer distinguish, the birds fighting for their\r\nperches, and on firing a shot they rose with a noise like the 'rushing\r\nof a mighty wind,' but soon settled again, and such a din commenced as I\r\nshall never forget; the shrill screams of the birds, the fluttering of\r\ntheir innumerable wings, and the rustling of the leaves of the palm\r\ntrees, was almost deafening, and I was glad at last to escape to the\r\nGovernment Rest House.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Annals of Nat. Hist_. vol xiii. p.263.]\r\n\r\nIV. COLUMBIDÆ. _Pigeons_.--Of pigeons and doves there are at least a\r\ndozen species; some living entirely on trees[1] and never alighting on\r\nthe ground; others, notwithstanding the abundance of food and warmth,\r\nare migratory[2], allured, as the Singhalese allege, by the ripening of\r\nthe cinnamon berries, and hence one species is known in the southern\r\nprovinces as the \"Cinnamon Dove.\" Others feed on the fruits of the\r\nbanyan: and it is probably to their instrumentality that this marvellous\r\ntree chiefly owes its diffusion, its seeds being carried by them to\r\nremote localities. A very beautiful pigeon, peculiar to the mountain\r\nrange, discovered in the lofty trees at Neuera-ellia, has, in compliment\r\nto the Vicountess Torrington, been named _Carpophaga Torringtoniæ._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Treron bicenta, _Jerd_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Alsocomus puniceus_, the \"Season Pigeon\" of Ceylon, so\r\ncalled from its periodical arrival and departure.]\r\n\r\nAnother, called by the natives _neela-cobeya_[1], although strikingly\r\nelegant both in shape and colour, is still more remarkable far the\r\nsingularly soothing effect of its low and harmonious voice. A gentleman\r\nwho has spent many years in the jungle, in writing to me of this bird\r\nand of the effects of its melodious song, says, that \"its soft and\r\nmelancholy notes, as they came from some solitary place in the forest,\r\nwere the most gentle sounds I ever listened to. Some sentimental smokers\r\nassert that the influence of the propensity is to make them feel _as if\r\nthey could freely forgive all who had ever offended them_, and I can say\r\nwith truth such has been the effect on my own nerves of the plaintive\r\nmurmurs of the neela-cobeya, that sometimes, when irritated, and not\r\nwithout reason, by the perverseness of some of my native followers, the\r\nfeeling has almost instantly subsided into placidity on suddenly hearing\r\nthe loving tones of these beautiful birds.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Chalcophaps Indicus, _Linn_.]\r\n\r\nV. GALLINÆ. _The Ceylon Jungle-fowl_.--The jungle-fowl of Ceylon[1] is\r\nshown by the peculiarity of its plumage to be distinct from the Indian\r\nspecies. It has never yet bred or survived long in captivity, and no\r\nliving specimens have been successfully transmitted to Europe. It\r\nabounds in all parts of the island, but chiefly in the lower ranges of\r\nmountains; and one of the vivid memorials which are associated with our\r\njourneys through the hills, is its clear cry, which sounds like a person\r\ncalling \"George Joyce.\" At early morning it rises amidst mist and dew,\r\ngiving life to the scenery that has scarcely yet been touched by the\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Gallus Lafayetti, _Lesson_.]\r\n\r\nVI. GRALLÆ.--On reaching the marshy plains and shallow lagoons on either\r\nside of the island, the astonishment of the stranger is excited by the\r\nendless multitudes of stilt-birds and waders which stand in long array\r\nwithin the wash of the water, or sweep in vast clouds above it.\r\nIbises[1], storks[2], egrets, spoonbills[3], herons[4], and the smaller\r\nraces of sand larks and plovers, are seen busily traversing the wet\r\nsand, in search of the red worm which burrows there, or peering with\r\nsteady eye to watch the motions of the small fry and aquatic insects in\r\nthe ripple on the shore.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Tantalus leucocephalus, and Ibis falcinellus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The violet-headed Stork (Ciconia leucocephala).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Platalea leucorodia, _Linn_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Ardea cinerea. A. purpurea.]\r\n\r\nVII. ANSERES.--Preeminent in size and beauty, the tall _flamingoes_[1],\r\nwith rose-coloured plumage, line the beach in long files. The Singhalese\r\nhave been led, from their colour and their military order, to designate\r\nthem the \"_English Soldier birds_.\" Nothing can be more startling than\r\nthe sudden flight of these splendid creatures when alarmed; their strong\r\nwings beating the air sound like distant thunder; and as they soar over\r\nhead, the flock which appeared almost white but a moment before, is\r\nconverted into crimson by the sudden display of the red lining of their\r\nwings. A peculiarity in the beak of the flamingo has scarcely attracted\r\ndue attention, as a striking illustration of creative wisdom in adapting\r\nthe organs of animals to their local necessities. The upper mandible,\r\nwhich is convex in other birds, is in them flattened, whilst the lower,\r\ninstead of being flat, is convex. To those who have had an opportunity\r\nof witnessing the action of the bird in its native haunts, the\r\nexpediency of this arrangement is at once apparent. The flamingo, to\r\ncounteract the extraordinary length of its legs, is provided with a\r\nproportionately long neck, so that in feeding in shallow water the crown\r\nof the head becomes inverted and the upper mandible brought into contact\r\nwith the bottom; where its flattened surface qualifies it for performing\r\nthe functions of the lower one in birds of the same class; and the edges\r\nof both being laminated, it is thus enabled, like the duck, by the aid\r\nof its fleshy tongue, to sift its food before swallowing.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Phoenicopterus roseus, _Pallas_.]\r\n\r\nFloating on the surface of the deeper water, are fleets of the Anatidæ,\r\nthe Coromandel teal[1], the Indian hooded gull[2], the Caspian tern, and\r\na countless variety of ducks and smaller fowl. Pelicans[3] in great\r\nnumbers resort to the mouths of the rivers, taking up their position at\r\nsunrise on some projecting rock, from which to dart on the passing fish,\r\nand returning far inland at night to their retreats among the trees\r\nwhich overshadow some ruined watercourse or deserted tank.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Nettapus Coromandelianus, _Gmel._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Larus brunnicephalus, _Jerd._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Pelicanus Philippensis, _Gmel._]\r\n\r\nOf the birds familiar to European sportsmen, partridges and quails are\r\nto be had at all times; the woodcock has occasionally been shot in the\r\nhills, and the ubiquitous snipe, which arrives in September from\r\nSouthern India, is identified not alone by the eccentricity of its\r\nflight, but by retaining in high perfection the qualities which have\r\nendeared it to the gastronome at home. But the magnificent pheasants\r\nwhich inhabit the Himalayan range and the woody hills of the Chin-Indian\r\npeninsula, have no representative amongst the tribes that people the\r\nwoods of Ceylon; although a bird believed to be a pheasant has more than\r\nonce been seen in the jungle, close to Rambodde, on the road to\r\nNeuera-ellía.\r\n\r\n_List of Ceylon Birds_.\r\n\r\nIn submitting this catalogue of the birds of Ceylon, I am anxious to\r\nstate that the copious mass of its contents is mainly due to the\r\nuntiring energy and exertions of my friend, Mr. E.L. Layard. Nearly\r\nevery bird in the list has fallen by his gun; so that the most ample\r\nfacilities have been thus provided, not only for extending the limited\r\namount of knowledge which formerly existed on this branch of the zoology\r\nof the island; but for correcting, by actual comparison with recent\r\nspecimens, the errors which had previously prevailed as to imperfectly\r\ndescribed species.

present\r\nknown, peculiar to the island; it will probably at some future day be\r\ndetermined that some included in it have a wider geographical range.\r\n\r\nHæmatornis spilogaster. The \"Ceylon eagle;\" was discovered by Mr. Layard\r\nin the Wanny, and by Dr. Kelaart at Trincomalie.\r\n\r\nAthene castonotus. The chestnut-winged hawk owl. This pretty little owl\r\nwas added to the list of Ceylon birds by Dr. Templeton.\r\n\r\nBatrachostomus monoliger.

The ashy-headed babbler; was found by Mr. Layard\r\nnear Ratnapoora.\r\n\r\nPomatorhinus melanurus. Mr. Layard states that the mountain babbler\r\nfrequents low, scraggy, impenetrable brush, along the margins of\r\ndeserted cheena land.\r\n\r\nMalacocercus rufescens. The red-dung thrush added by Dr. Templeton to\r\nthe Singhalese Fauna, is found in thick jungle in the southern and\r\nmidland districts.\r\n\r\nPycnonotus penicillatus. The yellow-eared bulbul; was found by Dr.\r\nKelaart at Neuera-ellia.\r\n\r\nButalis Muttui. This very handsome flycatcher was procured at Point\r\nPedro, by Mr. Layard.\r\n\r\nDicrurus edoliformis. Dr. Templeton found this kingcrow at the Bibloo\r\nOya. Mr. Layard has since got it at Ambogammoa.\r\n\r\nDicrurus leucopygialis. The Ceylon kingcrow was sent to Mr. Blyth from\r\nthe vicinity of Colombo, by Dr. Templeton.\r\n\r\nTephrodornis affinis. The Ceylon butcher-bird. A migratory species found\r\nin the wooded grass lands in October.\r\n\r\nCissa puella. Layard's mountain jay. A most lovely bird, found along\r\nmountain streams at Neuera-ellia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nEnlabes ptilogenys. Templeton's mynah. The largest and most beautiful of\r\nthe species. It is found in flocks perching on the highest trees,\r\nfeeding on berries.\r\n\r\nLoriculus asiaticus. The small parroquet, abundant in various districts.\r\n\r\nPalæornis Calthropæ. Layard's purple-headed parroquet, found at Kandy,\r\nis a very handsome bird, flying in flocks, and resting on the summits of\r\nthe very highest trees. Dr. Kelaart states that it is the only parroquet\r\nof the Neuera-ellia range.\r\n\r\nPalæornis Layardi. The Jaffna parroquet was discovered by Mr. Layard at\r\nPoint Pedro.\r\n\r\nMegalaima flavifrons. The yellow-headed barbet, is not uncommon.\r\n\r\nMegalaima rubricapilla, is found in most parts of the island.\r\n\r\nPicus gymnophthalmus. Layard's woodpecker. The smallest of the species,\r\nwas discovered near Colombo, amongst jak trees.\r\n\r\nBrachypternus Ceylonus. The Ceylon woodpecker, is found in abundance\r\nnear Neuera-ellia.\r\n\r\nBrachypternus rubescens. The red woodpecker.\r\n\r\nCentropus chlororhynchus. The yellow-billed cuckoo, was detected by Mr.\r\nLayard in dense jungle near Colombo and Avisavelle.\r\n\r\nPhoenicophaus pyrrhocephalus. The malkoha, is confined to the southern\r\nhighlands.\r\n\r\nTreron flavogularis. The common green pigeon, is found in abundance at\r\nthe top of Balacaddua Pass and at Ratnapoora. It feeds on berries and\r\nflies in large flocks. It was believed to be identical with the\r\nfollowing.--_Mag. Nat. Hist._ p. 58: 1854.\r\n\r\nTreron Pompadoura. The Pompadour pigeon. \"The Prince of Canino has shown\r\nthat this is a totally distinct bird, much smaller, with the quantity of\r\nmaroon colour on the mantle greatly reduced.\"--Paper by Mr. BLYTH, _Mag.\r\nNat Hist._ p. 514: 1857.\r\n\r\nCarpophaga Torringtoniæ. Lady Torrington's pigeon; a very handsome\r\npigeon discovered in the highlands by Dr. Kelaart. It flies high in long\r\nsweeps, and makes its nest on the loftiest trees.\r\n\r\nCarpophaga pusilla. The little-hill dove, a migratory species found by\r\nMr. Layard in the mountain zone, only appearing with the ripened fruit\r\nof the teak, banyan, &c., on which they feed.\r\n\r\nGallus Lafayetti. The Ceylon jungle fowl. The female of this handsome\r\nbird was figured by Mr. GRAY (_Ill. Ind. Zool._) under the name of G.\r\nStanleyi. The cock bird had long been lost to naturalists, until a\r\nspecimen was forwarded to Mr. Blyth, who at once recognised it as the\r\nlong-looked for male of Mr. Gray's recently described female. It is\r\nabundant in all the uncultivated portions of Ceylon; coming out into the\r\nopen spaces to feed in the mornings and evenings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nREPTILES.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIZARDS. _Iguana_.--One of the earliest if not the first remarkable\r\nanimal to startle a stranger on arriving in Ceylon, whilst wending his\r\nway from Point-de-Galle to Colombo, is a huge lizard of from four to\r\nfive feet in length, the Talla-goya of the Singhalese, and Iguana[1] of\r\nthe Europeans. It may be seen at noonday searching for ants and insects\r\nin the middle of the highway and along the fences; when disturbed, but\r\nby no means alarmed, by the approach of man, it moves off to a safe\r\ndistance; and, the intrusion being over, returns again to the occupation\r\nin which it had been interrupted. Repulsive as it is in appearance, it\r\nis perfectly harmless, and is hunted down by dogs in the maritime\r\nprovinces, where its delicate flesh is converted into curry, and its\r\nskin into shoes. When seized, it has the power of inflicting a smart\r\nblow with its tail. The Talla-goya lives in almost any convenient\r\nhollow, such as a hole in the ground, or the deserted nest of the\r\ntermites; and home small ones which frequented my garden at Colombo,\r\nmade their retreat in the heart of a decayed tree. A still larger\r\nspecies, the Kabragoya[2], which is partial to marshy ground, when\r\ndisturbed upon land, will take refuge in the nearest water. From the\r\nsomewhat eruptive appearance of the yellow blotches on its scales, a\r\nclosely allied species, similarly spotted, formerly obtained amongst\r\nnaturalists the name of _Monitor exanthemata_, and it is curious that\r\nthe native appellation of this one, Kabra[3], is suggestive of the same\r\nidea. The Singhalese, on a strictly homoeopathic principle, believe that\r\nits fat, externally applied, is a cure for cutaneous disorders, but that\r\ninwardly taken it is poisonous.[4] It is one of the incidents which seem\r\nto indicate that Ceylon belongs to a separate circle of physical\r\ngeography, this lizard has not hitherto been discovered on the continent\r\nof Hindustan, though it is found to the eastward in Burmah.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Monitor dracæna, _Linn_. Among the barbarous nostrums of\r\nthe uneducated natives both Singhalese and Tamil, is the tongue of the\r\niguana, which they regard as a specific for consumption, if plucked from\r\nthe living animal and swallowed whole.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Hydrosaurus salvator, _Wagler_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: In the _Mahawanso_ the hero, Tisso, is said to have been\r\n\"afflicted with a cutaneous complaint which, made his skin scaly like\r\nthat of the _godho_.\"--Ch. xxiv. p. 148. \"Godho\" is the Pali name for\r\nthe Kabra-goya.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: In the preparation of the mysterious poison, the\r\n_Cobra-tel_, which is regarded with so much horror by the Singhalese;\r\nthe unfortunate Kabra-goya is forced to take a painfully prominent part.\r\nThe receipt, as written down by a Kandyan, was sent to me from\r\nKornegalle, by Mr. Morris, in 1840; and in dramatic arrangement it far\r\noutdoes the cauldron of _Macbeth's_ witches. The ingredients are\r\nextracted from venomous snakes, the Cobra de Capello (from which it\r\ntakes its name), the Carawella, and the Tic prolonga, by making an\r\nincision in the head and suspending the reptiles over a chattie to\r\ncollect the poison. To this, arsenic and other drugs are added, and the\r\nwhole is to be \"boiled in a human skull, with the aid of the three\r\nKabra-goyas, which are tied on three sides of the fire, with their heads\r\ndirected towards it, and tormented by whips to make them hiss, so that\r\nthe fire may blaze. The froth from their lips is then to be added to the\r\nboiling mixture, and so soon as an oily scum rises to the surface, the\r\n_cobra-tel_ is complete.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough it is obvious that the arsenic is the main ingredient in the\r\npoison, Mr. Morris reported to me that this mode of preparing it was\r\nactually practised in his district; and the above account was\r\ntransmitted by him apropos to the murder of a Mohatal and his wife,\r\nwhich was then under investigation, and which had been committed with\r\nthe _cobra-tel_. Before commencing the operation of preparing the\r\npoison, a cock is first sacrificed to the yakkos or demons.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: In corroboration of the view propounded elsewhere (see pp.\r\n7, 84, &c.), and opposed to the popular belief that Ceylon, at some\r\nremote period, was detached from the continent of India by the\r\ninterposition of the sea, a list of reptiles will be found at p. 203,\r\nincluding, not only individual species, but whole genera peculiar to the\r\nisland, and not to be found on the mainland. See a paper by DR. A.\r\nGÜNTHER on _The Geog. Distribution of Reptiles_, Magaz. Nat. Hist. for\r\nMarch, 1859, p. 230.]\r\n\r\n_Blood-suckers_.--These, however, are but the stranger's introduction to\r\ninnumerable varieties of lizards, all most attractive in their sudden\r\nmovements, and some unsurpassed in the brilliancy of their colouring,\r\nwhich bask on banks, dart over rocks, and peer curiously out of the\r\ndecaying chinks of every ruined wall. In all their motion there is that\r\nvivid and brief energy, the rapid but restrained action which is\r\nassociated with their limited power of respiration, and which justifies\r\nthe accurate picture of--\r\n\r\n  \"The green lizard, rustling thro' the grass,\r\n  And up the fluted shaft, _with short, quick, spring_\r\n  To vanish in the chinks which time has made.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: ROGERS' _Pæstum_.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful of this race is the _green calotes_[1], in\r\nlength about twelve inches, which, with the exception of a few dark\r\nstreaks about the head, is as brilliant as the purest emerald or\r\nmalachite. Unlike its congeners of the same family, it never alters this\r\ndazzling hue, whilst many of them possess the power, like the chameleon,\r\nbut in a less degree, of exchanging their ordinary colours for others\r\nless conspicuous. The _C. ophiomachus_, and another, the _C.\r\nversicolor_, exhibit this faculty in a remarkable manner. The head and\r\nneck, when the animal is irritated or hastily swallowing its food,\r\nbecomes of a brilliant red (whence the latter has acquired the name of\r\nthe \"blood-sucker\"), whilst the usual tint of the rest of the body is\r\nconverted into pale yellow. The _sitana_[2], and a number of others,\r\nexhibit similar phenomena.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Calotes viridis, _Gray_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Sitana Ponticereana, _Cuv_.]\r\n\r\n_Chameleon_.--The true chameleon[1] is found, but not in great numbers,\r\nin the dry districts in the north of Ceylon, where it frequents the\r\ntrees, in slow pursuit of its insect prey. Whilst the faculty of this\r\ncreature to blush all the colours of the rainbow has attracted the\r\nwonder of all ages, sufficient attention has hardly been given to the\r\nimperfect sympathy which subsists between the two lobes of the brain,\r\nand the two sets of nerves which permeate the opposite sides of its\r\nframe. Hence, not only have each of the eyes an action quite independent\r\nof the other, but one side of its body would appear to be sometimes\r\nasleep whilst the other is vigilant and active: one will assume a green\r\ntinge whilst the opposite one is red; and it is said that the chameleon\r\nis utterly unable to swim, from the incapacity of the muscles of the two\r\nsides to act in concert.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Chamælio vulgaris, _Daud_.]\r\n\r\n_Ceratophora_.--A unique lizard, and hitherto known only by two\r\nspecimens, one in the British Museum, and another in that of Leyden, is\r\nthe _Ceratophora Stoddartii_, distinguished by the peculiarity of its\r\nhaving no external ear, whilst its muzzle bears on its extremity the\r\nhorn-like process from which it takes its name. It has recently been\r\ndiscovered by Dr. Kelaart to be a native of the higher Kandyan hills,\r\nwhere it is sometimes seen in the older trees in pursuit of sect\r\nlarvæ.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. Kelaart has likewise discovered at Neuera-ellia a\r\n_Salea_, distinct from the S. Jerdoni.]\r\n\r\n_Geckoes_.--But the most familiar and attractive of the class are the\r\n_Geckoes_[1], which frequent the sitting-rooms, and being furnished with\r\npads to each toe, are enabled to ascend perpendicular walls and adhere\r\nto glass and ceilings. Being nocturnal in their habits, the pupil of the\r\neye, instead of being circular as in the diurnal species, is linear and\r\nvertical like those of the cat. As soon as evening arrives, they emerge\r\nfrom the chinks and recesses where they conceal themselves during the\r\nday, in search of insects which retire to settle for the night, and are\r\nto be seen in every house in keen and crafty pursuit of their prey. In a\r\nboudoir where the ladies of my family spent their evenings, one of these\r\nfamiliar and amusing little creatures had its hiding-place behind a gilt\r\npicture frame, and punctually as the candles were lighted, it made its\r\nappearance on the wall to be fed with its accustomed crumb; and, if\r\nneglected, it reiterated its sharp quick call of _chic, chic, chit_,\r\ntill attended to. It was of a delicate grey colour, tinged with pink;\r\nand having by accident fallen on a work-table, it fled, leaving its tail\r\nbehind it, which, however, it reproduced within less than a month. This\r\nfaculty of reproduction is doubtless designed to enable the creature to\r\nescape from its assailants: the detaching of the limb is evidently its\r\nown act; and it is observable, that when reproduced, the tail generally\r\nexhibits some variation from its previous form, the diverging spines\r\nbeing absent, the new portion covered with small square uniform scales\r\nplaced in a cross series, and the scuta below being seldom so distinct\r\nas in the original member.[2] In an officer's quarters in the fort of\r\nColombo, a Geckoe had been taught to come daily to the dinner-table, and\r\nalways made its appearance along with the dessert. The family were\r\nabsent for some months, during which the house underwent extensive\r\nrepairs, the roof having been raised, the walls stuccoed, and ceilings\r\nwhitened. It was naturally surmised that so long a suspension of its\r\naccustomed habits would have led to the disappearance of the little\r\nlizard; but on the return of its old friends, at their first dinner it\r\nmade its entrance as usual the instant the cloth had been removed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Hemidactylus maculatus, _Dum_. et _Bib., Gray_; H.\r\nLeschenaultii, _Dum_. et _Bib_.; H. frenatus, _Schlegel_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Brit. Mus. Cat_. p. 143; KELAART'S Prod. Faun. Zeylan. p.\r\n183.]\r\n\r\n_Crocodile_.--The Portuguese in India, like the Spaniards in South\r\nAmerica, affixed the name of _lagarto_ to the huge reptiles which infest\r\nthe rivers and estuaries of both continents; and to the present day the\r\nEuropeans in Ceylon apply the term _alligator_ to what are in reality\r\n_crocodiles_, which literally swarm in the still waters and tanks\r\nthroughout the northern provinces, but rarely frequent rapid streams,\r\nand have never been found in the marshy elevations among the hills.\r\nTheir instincts in Ceylon present no variation from their habits in\r\nother countries. There would appear to be two well-distinguished species\r\nin the island, the _Allie Kimboola_[1], the Indian crocodile, which\r\ninhabits the rivers and estuaries throughout the low countries of the\r\ncoasts, attaining the length of sixteen or eighteen feet, and which will\r\nassail man when pressed by hunger; and the Marsh crocodile[2], which\r\nlives exclusively in fresh water, frequenting the tanks in the northern\r\nand central provinces, and confining its attacks to the smaller animals:\r\nin length it seldom exceeds twelve or thirteen feet. Sportsmen complain\r\nthat their dogs are constantly seized by both species; and water-fowl,\r\nwhen shot, frequently disappear before they can be secured by the\r\nfowler.[3] The Singhalese believe that the crocodile can only move\r\nswiftly on sand or smooth clay, its feet being too tender to tread\r\nfirmly on hard or stony ground. In the dry season, when the watercourses\r\nbegin to fail and the tanks become exhausted, the Marsh crocodiles are\r\nsometimes encountered wandering in search of water in the jungle; but\r\ngenerally, during the extreme drought, when unable to procure their\r\nordinary food from the drying up of the watercourses, they bury\r\nthemselves in the mud, and remain in a state of torpor till released by\r\nthe recurrence of the rains.[4] At Arne-tivoe, in the eastern province,\r\nwhilst riding across the parched bed of the tank, I was shown the\r\nrecess, still bearing the form and impress of the crocodile, out of\r\nwhich the animal had been seen to emerge the day before. A story was\r\nalso related to me of an officer attached to the department of the\r\nSurveyor-General, who, having pitched his tent in a similar position,\r\nhad been disturbed during the night by feeling a movement of the earth\r\nbelow his bed, from which on the following day a crocodile emerged,\r\nmaking its appearance from beneath the matting.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Crocodilus biporcatus. _Cuvier._]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Crocodilus palustris, _Less_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: In Siam the flesh of the crocodile is sold for food in the\r\nmarkets and bazaars. \"Un jour je vis plus de cinquante crocodiles,\r\npetits et grands, attachés aux colonnes de leurs maisons. Ils les\r\nvendent la chair comme on vendrait de la chair de porc, mais à bien\r\nmeilleur marché.\"--PALLEGOIX, _Siam_, vol. i. p. 174.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: HERODOTUS records the observations of the Egyptians that\r\nthe crocodile of the Nile abstains from food during the four winter\r\nmonths.--_Euterpe_, lviii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: HUMBOLDT relates a similar story as occurring at Calabazo,\r\nin Venezuela.--_Personal Narrative_, c. xvi.]\r\n\r\nThe species which inhabits the fresh water is essentially cowardly in\r\nits instincts, and hastens to conceal itself on the appearance of man. A\r\ngentleman (who told me the circumstance), when riding in the jungle,\r\novertook a crocodile, evidently roaming in search of water. It fled to a\r\nshallow pool almost dried by the sun, and, thrusting its head into the\r\nmud till it covered up its eyes, it remained unmoved in profound\r\nconfidence of perfect concealment. In 1833, during the progress of the\r\nPearl Fishery, Sir Robert Wilmot Horton employed men to drag for\r\ncrocodiles in a pond which was infested with them in the immediate\r\nvicinity of Aripo. The pool was about fifty yards in length, by ten or\r\ntwelve wide, shallowing gradually to the edge, and not exceeding four or\r\nfive feet in the deepest part. As the party approached the bund, from\r\ntwenty to thirty reptiles, which had been basking in the sun, rose and\r\nfled to the water. A net, specially weighted so as to sink its lower\r\nedge to the bottom, was then stretched from bank to bank and swept to\r\nthe further end of the pond, followed by a line of men with poles to\r\ndrive the crocodiles forward: so complete was the arrangement, that no\r\nindividual could evade the net, yet, to the astonishment of the\r\nGovernor's party, not one was to be found when it was drawn on shore,\r\nand no means of escape was apparent or possible except descending into\r\nthe mud at the bottom of the pond.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A remarkable instance of the vitality of the common\r\ncrocodile, _C. biporcatus_, was related to me by a gentleman at Galle:\r\nhe had caught on a baited hook an unusually large one, which his coolies\r\ndisembowelled, the aperture in the stomach being left expanded by a\r\nstick placed across it. On returning in the afternoon with a view to\r\nsecure the head, they found that the creature had crawled for some\r\ndistance, and made its escape into the water.]\r\n\r\nTESTUDINATA. _Tortoise_,--Of the _testudinata_ the land tortoises are\r\nnumerous, but present no remarkable features beyond the beautiful\r\nmarking of the starred variety[1], which is common, in the north-western\r\nprovince around Putlam and Chilaw, and is distinguished by the bright\r\nyellow rays which diversify the deep black of its dorsal shield. From\r\none of these which was kept in my garden I took a number of flat ticks\r\n(_Ixodes_), which adhered to its fleshy neck in such a position as to\r\nbaffle any attempt of the animal itself to remove them; but as they were\r\nexposed to constant danger of being crushed against the plastron during\r\nthe protrusion and retraction of the head, each was covered with a horny\r\ncase almost as resistant as the carapace of the tortoise itself. Such an\r\nadaptation of structure is scarcely less striking than that of the\r\nparasites found on the spotted lizard of Berar by Dr. Hooker, each of\r\nwhich presented the distinct colour of the scale to which it adhered.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Testudo stellata, _Schweig_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: HOOKER'S _Himalayan Journals_, vol. i. p. 37.]\r\n\r\nThe marshes and pools of the interior are frequented by the\r\nterrapins[1], which the natives are in the habit of keeping alive in\r\nwells under the conviction that they clear them of impurities. The\r\nedible turtle[2] is found on all the coasts of the island, and sells for\r\na few shillings or a few pence, according to its size and abundance at\r\nthe moment. At certain seasons the turtle on the south-western coast of\r\nCeylon is avoided as poisonous, and some lamentable instances are\r\nrecorded of death which was ascribed to their use. At Pantura, to the\r\nsouth of Colombo, twenty-eight persons who had partaken of turtle in\r\nOctober, 1840, were seized with sickness immediately, after which coma\r\nsucceeded, and eighteen died during the night. Those who survived said\r\nthere was nothing unusual in the appearance of the flesh except that it\r\nwas fatter than ordinary. Other similarly fatal occurrences have been\r\nattributed to turtle curry; but as they have never been proved to\r\nproceed exclusively from that source, there is room for believing that\r\nthe poison may have been contained in some other ingredient. In the Gulf\r\nof Manaar turtle is frequently found of such a size as to measure\r\nbetween four and five feet in length; and on one occasion, in riding\r\nalong the sea-shore north of Putlam, I saw a man in charge of some\r\nsheep, resting under the shade of a turtle shell, which he had erected\r\non sticks to protect him from the sun--almost verifying the statement of\r\nÆlian, that in the seas off Ceylon there are tortoises so large that\r\nseveral persons may find ample shelter beneath a single shell.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Emyda Ceylonensis_, GRAY, _Catalogue_, p. 64, tab. 29 a.;\r\n_Mag. Nat. Hist._ p. 265: 1856. Dr. KELAART, in his _Prodromus_ (p.\r\n179), refers this to the common Indian species, _E. punctata_; but Dr.\r\nGray has shown it to be a distinct one. It is generally distributed in\r\nthe lower parts of Ceylon, in lakes and tanks. It is put into wells to\r\nact the part of a scavenger. By the Singhalese it is named _Kiri-ibba_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Chelonia virgata, _Schweig_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"Tiktontai de ara en tautê tê thalattê, kai chelônai\r\nmegintai, ônper oun ta elytra orophoi ginontai kai gar esti kai\r\nmentekaideka pêchôn en chelôneion, hôs hypoikein ouk oligous, kai tous\r\nhêlious pyrôiestatous apostegei, kai skian asmetois parechei.\"--Lib.\r\nxvi. c. 17. Ælian copied this statement literatim from MEGASTHENES,\r\n_Indica Frag_. lix. 31; and may not Megasthenes have referred to some\r\ntradition connected with the gigantic fossilised species discovered on\r\nthe Sewalik Hills, the remains of which are now in the Museum at the\r\nEast India House?]\r\n\r\nThe hawksbill turtle[1], which supplies the tortoise-shell of commerce,\r\nwas at former times taken in great numbers in the vicinity of\r\nHambangtotte during the season when they came to deposit their eggs, and\r\nthere is still a considerable trade in this article, which is\r\nmanufactured into ornaments, boxes, and combs by the Moormen resident at\r\nGalle. If taken from the animal after death and decomposition, the\r\ncolour of the shell becomes clouded and milky, and hence the cruel\r\nexpedient is resorted to of seizing the turtles as they repair to the\r\nshore to deposit their eggs, and suspending them over fires till heat\r\nmakes the plates on the dorsal shields start from the bone of the\r\ncarapace, after which the creature is permitted to escape to the\r\nwater.[2] In illustration of the resistless influence of instinct at the\r\nperiod of breeding, it may be mentioned that the same tortoise is\r\nbelieved to return again and again to the same spot, notwithstanding\r\nthat at each visit she had to undergo a repetition of this torture. In\r\nthe year 1826, a hawksbill turtle was taken near Hambangtotte, which\r\nbore a ring attached to one of its fins that had been placed there by a\r\nDutch officer thirty years before, with a view to establish the fact of\r\nthese recurring visits to the same beach.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Chelonia imbricata; _Linn_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: At Celebes, whence the finest tortoise-shell is exported to\r\nChina, the natives kill the turtle by blows on the head, and immerse the\r\nshell in boiling water to detach the plates. Dry heat is only resorted\r\nto by the unskilful, who frequently destroy the tortoise-shell in the\r\noperation.--_Journ. Indian Archipel._ vol. iii. p. 227, 1849.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: BENNETT'S _Ceylon_, ch. xxxiv.]\r\n\r\n_Snakes_.--It is perhaps owing to the aversion excited by the ferocious\r\nexpression and unusual action of serpents, combined with an instinctive\r\ndread of attack, that exaggerated ideas prevail both as to their numbers\r\nin Ceylon, and the danger to be apprehended from encountering them. The\r\nSinghalese profess to distinguish a great many kinds, of which not more\r\nthan one half have as yet been scientifically identified; but so\r\ncautiously do serpents make their appearance, that the surprise of long\r\nresidents is invariably expressed at the rarity with which they are to\r\nbe seen; and from my own journeys, through the jungle, often of two to\r\nfive hundred miles, I have frequently returned without seeing a single\r\nsnake.[1] Davy, whose attention was carefully directed to the poisonous\r\nserpents of Ceylon[2], came to the conclusion that but _four_, out of\r\ntwenty species examined by him, were venomous, and that of these only\r\ntwo (the _tic-polonga[3]_ and _cobra de capello_[4]) were capable of\r\ninflicting a wound likely to be fatal to man. The third is the\r\n_caraicilla_[5], a brown snake of about twelve inches in length; and for\r\nthe fourth, of which only a few specimens have been, procured, the\r\nSinghalese have no name in their vernacular,--a proof that it is neither\r\ndeadly nor abundant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Bennett, who resided much in the south-east of the\r\nisland, ascribes the rarity of serpents in the jungle to the abundance\r\nof the wild peafowl, whose partiality to snakes renders them the chief\r\ndestroyers of these reptiles.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See DAVY'S _Ceylon_, ch. xiv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Dabois elegans, _Grey_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Naja tripadians, _Gunther_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Trigonocephalus hypnale, _Wegl_.]\r\n\r\n_Cobra de Capello_.--The cobra de capello is the only one exhibited by\r\nthe itinerant snake-charmers: and the accuracy of Davy's conjecture,\r\nthat they control it, not by extracting its fangs, but by courageously\r\navailing themselves of its accustomed timidity and extreme reluctance to\r\nuse its fatal weapons, received a painful confirmation during my\r\nresidence in Ceylon, by the death of one of these performers, whom his\r\naudience had provoked to attempt some unaccustomed familiarity with the\r\ncobra; it bit him on the wrist, and he expired the same evening. The\r\nhill near Kandy, on which the official residences of the Governor and\r\nColonial Secretary had been built, is covered in many places with the\r\ndeserted nests of the white ants (_termites_), and these are the\r\nfavourite retreats of the sluggish and spiritless cobra, which watches\r\nfrom their apertures the toads and lizards on which it preys. Here, when\r\nI have repeatedly come upon them, their only impulse was concealment;\r\nand on one occasion, when a cobra of considerable length could not\r\nescape sufficiently quickly, owing to the bank being nearly precipitous\r\non both sides of the road, a few blows from my whip were sufficient to\r\ndeprive it of life. There is a rare variety which the natives fancifully\r\ndesignate the \"king of the cobras;\" it has the head and the anterior\r\nhalf of the body of so light a colour, that at a distance it seems like\r\na silvery white.[1] A gentleman who held a civil appointment at\r\nKornegalle, had a servant who was bitten by a snake, and he informed me\r\nthat on enlarging a hole near the foot of the tree under which the\r\naccident occurred, he unearthed a cobra of upwards of three feet long,\r\nand so purely white as to induce him to believe that it was an albino.\r\nWith the exception of the rat-snake[2], the cobra de capello is the only\r\nserpent which seems from choice to frequent the vicinity of human\r\ndwellings, but it is doubtless attracted by the young of the domestic\r\nfowl and by the moisture of the wells and drainage. The Singhalese\r\nremark that if one cobra be destroyed near a house, its companion is\r\nalmost certain to be discovered immediately after,--a popular belief\r\nwhich I had an opportunity of verifying on more than one occasion. Once,\r\nwhen a snake of this description was killed in a bath of Government\r\nHouse at Colombo, its mate was found in the same spot the day after; and\r\nagain, at my own stables, a cobra of five feet long, having fallen into\r\nthe well, which was too deep to permit its escape, its companion of the\r\nsame size was found the same morning in an adjoining drain.[3] On this\r\noccasion the snake, which had been several hours in the well, swam with\r\nease, raising its head and hood above water; and instances have\r\nrepeatedly occurred of the cobra de capello voluntarily taking\r\nconsiderable excursions by sea. When the \"Wellington,\" a government\r\nvessel employed in the conservancy of the pearl banks, was anchored\r\nabout a quarter of a mile from land, in the bay of Koodremalé, a cobra\r\nwas seen, about an hour before sunset, swimming vigorously towards the\r\nship. It came within twelve yards, when the sailors assailed it with\r\nbillets of wood and other missiles, and forced it to return to land. The\r\nfollowing morning they discovered the track which it had left on the\r\nshore, and traced it along the sand till it disappeared in the\r\njungle.[4] On a later occasion, in the vicinity of the same spot, when\r\nthe \"Wellington\" was lying at some distance from the shore, a cobra was\r\nfound and killed on board, where it could only have gained access by\r\nclimbing up the cable. It was first discovered by a sailor, who felt the\r\nchill as it glided over his foot.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A Singhalese work, the _Sarpa Doata_, quoted in the _Ceylon\r\nTimes_, January, 1857, enumerates four species of the cobra;--the\r\n_raja_, or king; the _velyander_, or trader; the _baboona_, or hermit;\r\nand the _goore_, or agriculturist. The young cobras, it says, are not\r\nvenomous till after the thirteenth day, when they shed their coat for\r\nthe first time.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Coryphodon Blumenbachii. WOLF, in his interesting story of\r\nhis _Life and Adventures in Ceylon_, mentions that rat-snakes were often\r\nso domesticated by the natives as to feed at their table. He says: \"I\r\nonce saw an example of this in the house of a native. It being meal\r\ntime, he called his snake, which immediately came forth from the roof\r\nunder which he and I were sitting. He gave it victuals from his own\r\ndish, which the snake took of itself from off a fig-leaf that was laid\r\nfor it, and ate along with its host. When it had eaten its fill, he gave\r\nit a kiss and bade it go to its hole.\"\r\n\r\nSince the above was written, Major Skinner, writing to me 12th Dec.\r\n1858, mentions the still more remarkable case of the domestication of\r\nthe cobra de capello in Ceylon. \"Did you ever hear,\" he says, \"of tame\r\ncobras being kept and domesticated about a house, going in and out at\r\npleasure, and in common with the rest of the inmates? In one family,\r\nnear Negombo, cobras are kept as protectors, in the place of dogs, by a\r\nwealthy man who has always large sums of money in his house. But this is\r\nnot a solitary case of the kind. I heard of it only the other day, but\r\nfrom undoubtedly good authority. The snakes glide about the house, a\r\nterror to thieves, but never attempting to harm the inmates.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: PLINY notices the affection that subsists between the male\r\nand female asp; and that if one of them happens to be killed, the other\r\nseeks to avenge its death.--Lib. viii. c. 37.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: STEWART'S _Account of the Pearl Fisheries of Ceylon_, p. 9:\r\nColombo, 1843.\r\n\r\nThe Python reticulatus (the \"rock-snake\") has been known like the cobra\r\nde capello, to make short voyages at sea. One was taken on board H.M.S.\r\n\"Hastings,\" when off the coast of Burmah, in 1853; it is now in the\r\npossession of the surgeon, Dr. Scott.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: SWAINSON, in his _Habits and Instincts of Animals_, c. iv.\r\np. 187, says that instances are well attested of the common English\r\nsnake having been met with in the open channel; between the coast of\r\nWales and the island of Anglesea, as if they had taken their departure\r\nfrom the one and were bound for the other.]\r\n\r\nIn BENNETT'S account of \"_Ceylon and its Capabilities_\" there is a\r\ncurious piece of Singhalese folk-lore, to the effect, that the cobra de\r\ncapello every time it expends its poison _loses a joint of its tail_,\r\nand eventually acquires a head which resembles that of a toad. A recent\r\ndiscovery of Dr. Kelaart has thrown light on the origin of this popular\r\nfallacy. The family of \"false snakes\" (_pseudo-typhlops_), as Schlegel\r\nnames the group, have till lately consisted of but three species, one\r\nonly of which was known to inhabit Ceylon. They belong to a family\r\nintermediate between the lizards and serpents with the body of the\r\nlatter, and the head of the former, with which they are moreover\r\nidentified by having the upper jaw fixed to the skull as in mammals and\r\nbirds, instead of movable as amongst the true ophidians. In this they\r\nresemble the amphisbænidæ; but the tribe of _Uropeltidæ_, or \"rough\r\ntails,\" has the further peculiarity, that the tail is truncated, instead\r\nof ending, like that of the typhlops, in a point more or less acute; and\r\nthe reptile assists its own movements by pressing the flat end to the\r\nground. Within a very recent period an important addition has been made\r\nto this genus, by the discovery of five new species in Ceylon; in some\r\nof which the singular construction of the tail is developed to an extent\r\nmuch more marked than in any previously existing specimen. One of these,\r\nthe _Uropeltis grandis_ of Kelaart, is distinguished by its dark brown\r\ncolour, shot with a bluish metallic lustre, closely approaching the\r\nordinary shade of the cobra; and the tail is abruptly and flatly\r\ncompressed as though it had been severed by a knife. The form of this\r\nsingular reptile will be best understood by a reference to the\r\naccompanying figure; and there can be, I think, little doubt that to its\r\nstrange and anomalous structure is to be traced the fable of the\r\ntransformation of the cobra de capello. The colour alone would seem to\r\nidentify the two reptiles, but the head and mouth are no longer those of\r\na serpent, and the disappearance of the tail might readily suggest the\r\nmutilation which the tradition asserts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UROPELTIS GRANDIS]\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese Buddhists, in their religious abstinence from inflicting\r\ndeath on any creature, are accustomed, after securing a venomous snake,\r\nto enclose it in a basket of woven palm leaves, and to set it afloat on\r\na river. During my residence in Ceylon, I never heard of the death of a\r\nEuropean which was caused by the bite of a snake; and in the returns of\r\ncoroners' inquests which were made officially to my department, such\r\naccidents to the natives appear chiefly to have happened at night, when\r\nthe animal having been surprised or trodden on, had inflicted the wound\r\nin self-defence.[1] For these reasons the Singhalese, when obliged to\r\nleave their houses in the dark, carry a stick with a loose ring, the\r\nnoise[2] of which as they strike it on the ground is sufficient to warn\r\nthe snakes to leave their path.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In a return of 112 coroners' inquests, in cases of death\r\nfrom wild animals, held in Ceylon in five years, from 1851 to 1855\r\ninclusive, 68 are ascribed to the bites of serpents; and in almost every\r\ninstance the assault is set down as having taken place _at night_. The\r\nmajority of the sufferers were children and women.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: PLINY notices that the serpent has the sense of hearing\r\nmore acute than that of sight; and that it is more frequently put in\r\nmotion by the sound of footsteps than by the appearance of the intruder,\r\n\"excitatur pede sæpius.\"--Lib. viii. c. 36.]\r\n\r\n_The Python_.--The great python[1] (the \"boa,\" as it is commonly\r\ndesignated by Europeans, the \"anaconda\" of Eastern story), which is\r\nsupposed to crush the bones of an elephant, and to swallow the tiger, is\r\nfound, though not of so portentous dimensions, in the cinnamon gardens\r\nwithin a mile of the fort of Colombo, where it feeds on hog-deer and\r\nother smaller animals.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Python reticulatus, _Gray_.]\r\n\r\nThe natives occasionally take it alive, and securing it to a pole expose\r\nit for sale as a curiosity. One which was brought to me in this way\r\nmeasured seventeen feet with a proportionate thickness: but another\r\nwhich crossed my path on a coffee estate on the Peacock Mountain at\r\nPusilawa, considerably exceeded these dimensions. Another which I\r\nwatched in the garden at Elie House, near Colombo, surprised me by the\r\nease with which it erected itself almost perpendicularly in order to\r\nscale a wall upwards of ten feet high.\r\n\r\nOf ten species which ascend the trees to search for squirrels and\r\nlizards, and to rifle the nests of birds, one half, including the green\r\n_carawilla_, and the deadly _tic polonga_, are believed by the natives\r\nto be venomous; but the fact is very dubious. I have heard of the cobra\r\nbeing found on the crown of a coco-nut palm, attracted, it was said, by\r\nthe toddy which was flowing at the time, as it was the season for\r\ndrawing it.\r\n\r\n_Water-Snakes_.--The fresh-water snakes, of which four species have been\r\ndescribed as inhabiting the still water and pools, are all harmless in\r\nCeylon. A gentleman, who found near a river an agglutinated cluster of\r\nthe eggs of one variety _(Tropidonotus umbratus)_, placed them under a\r\nglass shade on his drawing-room table, where one by one the young\r\nserpents emerged from the shell to the number of twenty.\r\n\r\nThe use of the Pamboo-Kaloo, or snake-stone, as a remedy in cases of\r\nwounds by venomous serpents, has probably been communicated to the\r\nSinghalese by the itinerant snake-charmers who resort to the island from\r\nthe coast of Coromandel; and more than one well-authenticated instance\r\nof its successful application has been told to me by persons who had\r\nbeen eye-witnesses to what they described. On one occasion, in March,\r\n1854, a friend of mine was riding, with some other civil officers of the\r\ngovernment, along a jungle path in the vicinity of Bintenne, when they\r\nsaw one of two Tamils, who were approaching them, suddenly dart into the\r\nforest and return, holding in both hands a cobra de capello which he had\r\nseized by the head and tail. He called to his companion for assistance\r\nto place it in their covered basket, but, in doing this, he handled it\r\nso inexpertly that it seized him by the finger, and retained its hold\r\nfor a few seconds, as if unable to retract its fangs. The blood flowed,\r\nand intense pain appeared to follow almost immediately; but, with all\r\nexpedition, the friend of the sufferer undid his waistcloth, and took\r\nfrom it two snake-stones, each of the size of a small almond, intensely\r\nblack and highly polished, though of an extremely light substance. These\r\nhe applied one to each wound inflicted by the teeth of the serpent, to\r\nwhich the stones attached themselves closely, the blood that oozed from\r\nthe bites being rapidly imbibed by the porous texture of the article\r\napplied. The stones adhered tenaciously for three or four minutes, the\r\nwounded man's companion in the meanwhile rubbing his arm downwards from\r\nthe shoulder towards the fingers. At length the snake-stones dropped off\r\nof their own accord; the suffering of the man appeared to have subsided;\r\nhe twisted his fingers till the joints cracked, and went on his way\r\nwithout concern. Whilst this had been going on, another Indian of the\r\nparty who had come up took from his bag a small piece of white wood,\r\nwhich resembled a root, and passed it gently near the head of the cobra,\r\nwhich the latter immediately inclined close to the ground; he then\r\nlifted the snake without hesitation, and coiled it into a circle at the\r\nbottom of his basket. The root by which he professed to be enabled to\r\nperform this operation with safety he called the _Naya-thalee Kalinga_\r\n(the root of the snake-plant), protected by which he professed his\r\nability to approach any reptile with impunity.\r\n\r\nIn another instance, in 1853, Mr. Lavalliere, the District Judge of\r\nKandy, informed me that he saw a snake-charmer in the jungle, close by\r\nthe town, search for a cobra de capello, and, after disturbing it in its\r\nretreat, the man tried to secure it, but, in the attempt, he was bitten\r\nin the thigh till blood trickled from the wound. He instantly applied\r\nthe _Pamboo-Kaloo_, which adhered closely for about ten minutes, during\r\nwhich time he passed the root which he held in his hand backwards and\r\nforwards above the stone, till the latter dropped to the ground. He\r\nassured Mr. Lavalliere that all danger was then past. That gentleman\r\nobtained from him the snake-stone he had relied on, and saw him\r\nrepeatedly afterwards in perfect health.\r\n\r\nThe substances which were used on both these occasions are now in my\r\npossession. The roots employed by the several parties are not identical.\r\nOne appears to be a bit of the stem of an Aristolochia; the other is so\r\ndried as to render it difficult to identify it, but it resembles the\r\nquadrangular stem of a jungle vine. Some species of Aristolochia, such\r\nas the _A. serpentaria_ of North America, are supposed to act as a\r\nspecific in the cure of snake-bites; and the _A. indica_ is the plant to\r\nwhich the ichneumon is popularly believed to resort as an antidote when\r\nbitten[1]; but it is probable that the use of any particular plant by\r\nthe snake-charmers is a pretence, or rather a delusion, the reptile\r\nbeing overpowered by the resolute action of the operator, and not by the\r\ninfluence of any secondary appliance, the confidence inspired by the\r\nsupposed talisman enabling its possessor to address himself fearlessly\r\nto his task, and thus to effect, by determination and will, what is\r\npopularly believed to be the result of charms and stupefaction. Still it\r\nis curious that, amongst the natives of Northern Africa, who lay hold of\r\nthe _Cerastes_ without fear or hesitation, their impunity is ascribed to\r\nthe use of a plant with which they anoint themselves before touching the\r\nreptile[2]; and Bruce says of the people of Sennar that they acquire\r\nexemption from the fatal consequences of the bite by chewing a\r\nparticular root and washing themselves with an infusion of certain\r\nplants. He adds that a portion of this root was given him, with a view\r\nto test its efficacy in his own person, but that he had not sufficient\r\nresolution to undergo the experiment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For an account of the encounter between the ichneumon and\r\nthe venomous snakes of Ceylon, see Pt. II. ch. i. p. 149.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Hassellquist.]\r\n\r\nAs to the snake-stone itself, I submitted one, the application of which\r\nI have been describing, to Mr. Faraday, and he has communicated to me,\r\nas the result of his analysis, his belief that it is \"a piece of charred\r\nbone which has been filled with blood perhaps several times, and then\r\ncarefully charred again. Evidence of this is afforded, as well by the\r\napertures of cells or tubes on its surface as by the fact that it yields\r\nand breaks under pressure, and exhibits an organic structure within.\r\nWhen heated slightly, water rises from it, and also a little ammonia;\r\nand, if heated still more highly in the air, carbon burns away, and a\r\nbulky white ash is left, retaining the shape and size of the stone.\"\r\nThis ash, as is evident from inspection, cannot have belonged to any\r\nvegetable substance, for it is almost entirely composed of phosphate of\r\nlime. Mr. Faraday adds that \"if the piece of matter has ever been\r\nemployed as a spongy absorbent, it seems hardly fit for that purpose in\r\nits present state; but who can say to what treatment it has been\r\nsubjected since it was fit for use, or to what treatment the natives may\r\nsubmit it when expecting to have occasion to use it?\"\r\n\r\nThe probability is, that the animal charcoal, when instantaneously\r\napplied, may be sufficiently porous and absorbent to extract the venom\r\nfrom the recent wound, together with a portion of the blood, before it\r\nhas had time to be carried into the system; and that the blood which Mr.\r\nFaraday detected in the specimen submitted to him was that of the Indian\r\non whose person the effect was exhibited on the occasion to which my\r\ninformant was an eye-witness. The snake-charmers from the coast who\r\nvisit Ceylon profess to prepare the snake-stones for themselves, and\r\npreserve the composition as a secret. Dr. Davy[1], on the authority of\r\nSir Alexander Johnston, says the manufacture of them is a lucrative\r\ntrade, carried on by the monks of Manilla, who supply the merchants of\r\nIndia--and his analysis confirms that of Mr. Faraday. Of the three\r\ndifferent kinds which he examined--one being of partially burnt bone,\r\nand another of chalk, the third, consisting chiefly of vegetable matter,\r\nresembled a bezoar,--all of them (except the first, which possessed a\r\nslight absorbent power) were quite inert, and incapable of having any\r\neffect exclusive of that on the imagination of the patient. Thunberg was\r\nshown the snake-stone used by the boers at the Cape in 1772, which was\r\nimported for them \"from the Indies, especially from Malabar,\" at so high\r\na price that few of the farmers could afford to possess themselves of\r\nit; he describes it as convex on one side black, and so porous that\r\n\"when thrown into water, it caused bubbles to rise;\" and hence, by its\r\nabsorption, it served, if speedily applied, to extract the poison from\r\nthe wound.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Account of the Interior of Ceylon_, ch. iii. p. 101.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Thunberg_, vol. 1. p. 155.]\r\n\r\n_Caecilia_.--The rocky jungle, bordering the higher coffee estates,\r\nprovides a safe retreat for a very singular animal, first introduced to\r\nthe notice of European naturalists about a century ago by Linnæus, who\r\ngave it the name _Caecilia glutinosa_, to indicate two peculiarities\r\nmanifest to the ordinary observer--an apparent defect of vision, from\r\nthe eyes being so small and imbedded as to be scarcely distinguishable;\r\nand a power of secreting from minute pores in the skin a viscous fluid,\r\nresembling that of snails, eels, and some salamanders. Specimens are\r\nrare in Europe from the readiness with which it decomposes, breaking\r\ndown into a flaky mass in the spirits in which it is attempted to be\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nThe creature is about the length and thickness of an ordinary round desk\r\nruler, a little flattened before and rounded behind. It is brownish,\r\nwith a pale stripe along either side. The skin is furrowed into 350\r\ncircular folds, in which are imbedded minute scales. The head is\r\ntolerably distinct, with a double row of fine curved teeth for seizing\r\nthe insects and worms on which it is supposed to live.\r\n\r\nNaturalists are most desirous that the habits and metamorphoses of this\r\ncreature should be carefully ascertained, for great doubts have been\r\nentertained as to the position it is entitled to occupy in the chain of\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n_Frogs_.--In the numerous marshes formed by the overflowing of the\r\nrivers in the vast plains of the low country, there are many varieties\r\nof frogs, which, both by their colours and by their extraordinary size,\r\nare calculated to excite the surprise of strangers.[1] In the lakes\r\naround Colombo and the still water near Trincomalie, there are huge\r\ncreatures of this family, from six to eight inches in length[2], of an\r\nolive hue, deepening into brown on the back and yellow on the under\r\nside. The Kandian species, recently described, is much less in\r\ndimensions, but distinguished by its brilliant colouring, a beautiful\r\ngrass green above and deep orange underneath.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Indian toad (Bufo melanostictus, _Schneid_) is found In\r\nCeylon, and the belief in its venomous nature is as old as the third\r\ncentury B.C., when the _Mahawanso_ mentions that the wife of \"King Asoca\r\nattempted to destroy the great bo-tree (at Magadha) _with the poisoned\r\nfang of a toad_.\"--Ch. xx. p. 122.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Rana eutipora, and the Malabar bull-frog, R. Malabarica.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: R. Kandiana, _Kelaart_.]\r\n\r\nIn the shrubberies around my house at Colombo the graceful little\r\nhylas[1] were to be found in great numbers, crouching under broad leaves\r\nto protect them from the scorching sun; some of them utter a sharp\r\nmetallic sound at night, similar to that produced by smacking the lips.\r\nThey possess in a high degree the power of changing their colour; and\r\none which had seated itself on the gilt pillar of a dinner lamp was\r\nscarcely to be distinguished from the or-molu to which it clung. They\r\nare enabled to ascend glass by means of the suckers at the extremity of\r\ntheir toes. Their food consists of flies and minute coleoptera.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The tree-frog, Hyla leucomystax, _Gracer_.]\r\n\r\n_List of Ceylon Reptiles_.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Dr. Gray of the British Museum for a more complete\r\nenumeration of the reptiles of Ceylon than is to be found in Dr.\r\nKelaart's published lists; but many of those new to Europeans have been\r\ncarefully described by the latter gentleman in his _Prodromus Faunae\r\nZeylanicae_ and its appendices, as well as in the 13th vol. _Magaz.

IV.\r\n\r\nFISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle has been yet done to examine and describe the fishes of Ceylon,\r\nespecially those which frequent the rivers and inland waters. Mr.\r\nBennett, who was for some years employed in the Civil Service, directed\r\nhis attention to the subject, and published in 1830 some portions of a\r\nprojected work on the marine ichthyology of the island[1], but it never\r\nproceeded beyond the description of about thirty individuals. The great\r\nwork of Cuvier and Valenciennes[2] particularises about one hundred\r\nspecies, specimens of which were procured from Ceylon by Reynard\r\nLeschenault and other correspondents, but of these not more than half a\r\ndozen belong to fresh water.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _A Selection of the most Remarkable and Interesting Fishes\r\nfound on the Coast of Ceylon_. By J.W. BENNETT, Esq. London, 1830.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Historie Naturelle des Poissons_.]\r\n\r\nThe fishes of the coast, so far as they have been examined, present few\r\nwhich are not common to the seas of Ceylon and India. A series of\r\ndrawings, including upwards of six hundred species and varieties, of\r\nCeylon fish, all made from recently-captured specimens, has been\r\nsubmitted to Professor Huxley, and a notice of their general\r\ncharacteristics forms an interesting article in the appendix to the\r\npresent chapter.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See note C to this chapter.]\r\n\r\nOf those in ordinary use for the table the finest by far is the\r\nSeir-fish[1], a species of scomber, which is called _Tora-malu_ by the\r\nnatives. It is in size and form very similar to the salmon, to which the\r\nflesh of the female fish, notwithstanding its white colour, bears a very\r\nclose resemblance both in firmness and flavour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Cybium (Scomber, _Linn_.) guttatum.]\r\n\r\nMackerel, dories, carp, whitings, mullet, red and striped, perches and\r\nsoles, are abundant, and a sardine (_Sardinella Neohowii_, Val.)\r\nfrequents the southern and eastern coast in such profusion that on one\r\ninstance in 1839 a gentleman, who was present, saw upwards of four\r\nhundred thousand taken in a haul of the nets in the little bay of\r\nGoyapanna, east of Point-de-Galle. As this vast shoal approached the\r\nshore the broken water became as smooth as if a sheet of ice had been\r\nfloating below the surface.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: These facts serve to explain the story told by the friar\r\nODORIC of Friule, who visited India about the year 1320 A.D., and says\r\nthere are \"fishes in those seas that come swimming towards the said\r\ncountry in such abundance that for a great distance into the sea nothing\r\ncan be seen but the backs of fishes, which casting themselves on the\r\nshore, do suffer men for the space of three daies to come and to take as\r\nmany of them as they please, and then they return again into the\r\nsea.\"--_Hakluyt_, vol. ii. p. 57.]\r\n\r\n_Poisonous Fishes_.--The sardine has the reputation of being poisonous\r\nat certain seasons, and accidents ascribed to its use are recorded in\r\nall parts of the island. Whole families of fishermen who have partaken\r\nof it have died. Twelve persons in the jail of Chilaw were thus poisoned\r\nabout the year 1829; and the deaths of soldiers have repeatedly been\r\nascribed to the same cause. It is difficult in such instances to say\r\nwith certainty whether the fish were in fault; whether there may not\r\nhave been a peculiar susceptibility in the condition of the recipients;\r\nor whether the mischief may not have been occasioned by the wilful\r\nadministration of poison, or its accidental occurrence in the brass\r\ncooking vessels used by the natives. The popular belief was, however,\r\ndeferred to by an order passed by the Governor in Council in February,\r\n1824, which, after reciting that \"Whereas it appears by information\r\nconveyed to the Government that at three several periods at Trincomalie\r\ndeath has been the consequence to several persons from eating the fish\r\ncalled Sardinia during the months of January and December,\" enacts that\r\nit shall not be lawful in that district to catch sardines during these\r\nmonths, under pain of fine and imprisonment. This order is still in\r\nforce, but the fishing continues notwithstanding.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There are two species of Sardine at Ceylon; the _S.\r\nneohowii_, Val., alluded to above, and the _S. leiogaster_, Val. and\r\nCuv. xx. 270, which was found by Mr. Reynaud at Trincomalie. It occurs\r\nalso off the coast of Java. Another Ceylon fish of the same group, a\r\nClupea, is known as the \"poisonous sprat,\" the bonito (_Scomber\r\npelamys?_), the kangewena, or unicorn fish (_Balistes?_), and a number\r\nof others, are more or less in bad repute from the same imputation.]\r\n\r\n_Sharks_.--Sharks appear on all parts of the coast, and instances\r\ncontinually occur of persons being seized by them whilst bathing even in\r\nthe harbours of Trincomalie and Colombo. In the Gulf of Manaar they are\r\ntaken for the sake of their oil, of which they yield such a quantity\r\nthat \"shark's oil\" is now a recognised export. A trade also exists in\r\ndrying their fins, and from the gelatine contained in them, they find a\r\nready market in China, to which the skin of the basking shark is also\r\nsent;--it is said to be there converted into shagreen.\r\n\r\n_Saw Fish._--The huge saw fish, the _Pristis antiquorum_[1], infests the\r\neastern coast of the island[2], where it attains a length of from twelve\r\nto fifteen feet, including the powerful weapon from which its name is\r\nderived.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Two other species are found in the Ceylon waters, _P.\r\ncuspidatus_ and _P. pectinatus_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: ELIAN mentions, amongst the extraordinary marine animals\r\nfound in the seas around Ceylon, a fish _with feet instead of fins;\r\n[Greek: poias ge mên chêlas ê pteri gia.]_--Lib xvi. c. 18. Does not\r\nthis drawing of a species of Chironectes, captured near Colombo, justify\r\nhis description?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHIRONECTES]]\r\n\r\nBut the most striking to the eye of a stranger are those fishes whose\r\nbrilliancy of colouring has won for them the wonder even of the listless\r\nSinghalese. Some, like the Red Sea Perch (_Helocentrus ruber_, Bennett)\r\nand the Great Fire Fish[1], are of the deepest scarlet and flame colour;\r\nin others purple predominates, as in the _Serranus flavo-cæruleus_; in\r\nothers yellow, as in the _Chæetodon Brownriggii_[2], and _Acanthurus\r\nvittatus_, Bennett[3], and numbers, from the lustrous green of their\r\nscales, have obtained from the natives the appropriate name of\r\n_Giraway_, or _parrots_, of which one, the _Sparus Hardwickii_ of\r\nBennett, is called the \"Flower Parrot,\" from its exquisite colouring,\r\nbeing barred with irregular bands of blue, crimson, and purple, green,\r\nyellow, and grey, and crossed by perpendicular stripes of black.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Pterois muricata_, Cuv. and Val. iv. 363. _Scorpæna\r\nmiles_, Bennett; named, by the Singhalese, \"_Maha-rata-gini_,\" the Great\r\nRed Fire, a very brilliant red species spotted with black. It is very\r\nvoracious, and is regarded on some parts of the coast as edible, while\r\non others it is rejected. Mr. Bennett has given a drawing of this\r\nspecies, (pl. 9), so well marked by the armature of the head. The French\r\nnaturalists regard this figure as being only a highly-coloured variety\r\nof their species \"dont l'éclat est occasionné par la saison de l'amour.\"\r\nIt is found in the Red Sea and Bourbon and Penang. Dr. CANTOR calls it\r\n_Pterois miles_, and reports that it preys upon small crustaceæ.--_Cat.\r\nMalayan Fishes_, p. 44.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Glyphisodon Brownriggii_, Cuv. and Val. v. 484; _Chætodon\r\nBrownriggii_, Bennett. A very small fish about two inches long, called\r\n_Kaha bartikyha_ by the natives. It is distinct from Chætodon, in which\r\nMr. Bennett placed it. Numerous species of this genus are scattered\r\nthroughout the Indian Ocean. It derives its name from the fine hair-like\r\ncharacter of its teeth. They are found chiefly among coral reefs, and,\r\nthough eaten, are not much esteemed. In the French colonies they are\r\ncalled \"Chauffe-soleil.\" One species is found on the shores of the New\r\nWorld (_G. saxatilis_), and it is curious that Messrs. Quoy and Gaimard\r\nfound this fish at the Cape de Verde Islands in 1827.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: This fish has a sharp round spine on the side of the body\r\nnear the tail; a formidable weapon, which is generally partially\r\nconcealed within a scabbard-like incision. The fish raises or depresses\r\nthis spine at pleasure. It is yellow, with several nearly parallel blue\r\nstripes on the back and sides; the belly is white, the tail and fins\r\nbrownish green, edged with blue.\r\n\r\nIt is found in rocky places; and according to Mr. Bennett, who has\r\nfigured it in his second plate, it is named _Seweya_. It is scarce on\r\nthe southern coast of Ceylon.]\r\n\r\n_Fresh-water Fishes._--Of the fresh-water fish, which inhabit the rivers\r\nand tanks, so very little has hitherto been known to naturalists[1],\r\nthat of nineteen drawings sent home by Major Skinner in 1852, although\r\nspecimens of well-known genera, Colonel Hamilton Smith pronounced nearly\r\nthe whole to be new and undescribed species.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In extenuation of the little that is known of the\r\nfresh-water fishes of Ceylon, it may be observed that very few of them\r\nare used at table by Europeans, and there is therefore no stimulus on\r\nthe part of the natives to catch them. The burbot and grey mullet are\r\noccasionally eaten, but they taste of mud, and are not in request.]\r\n\r\nOf eight of these, which were from the Mahawelli-ganga, and caught in\r\nthe vicinity of Kandy, five were carps[1], of which two were _Leucisci_,\r\nand one a _Mastacemblus_, to which Col. H. Smith has given the name of\r\nits discoverer, _M. Skinneri_[2], one was an _Ophicephalus_, and one a\r\n_Polyacanthus_, with no serræ on the gills. Six were from the\r\nKalany-ganga, close to Colombo, of which two were _Helastoma_, in shape\r\napproaching the Choetodon; two _Ophicephali_, one a _Silurus_, and one\r\nan _Anabas_, but the gills were without denticulation. From the still\r\nwater of the lake, close to the walls of Colombo, there were two species\r\nof _Eleotris_, one _Silurus_ with barbels, and two _Malacopterygians_,\r\nwhich appear to be _Bagri_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Of the fresh-water fishes belonging to the family\r\nCyprinidæ, there are about eighteen species from Ceylon in the\r\ncollection of the British Museum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This fish bears the native name of _Theliya_ in Major\r\nSkinner's list; and is described by Colonel Hamilton Smith as being \"of\r\nthe proportions of an eel; beautifully mottled, with eyes and spots of a\r\nlighter olive upon a dark green.\" This so nearly corresponds with a fish\r\nof the same name, _Theliya_, which was brought to Gronovius from Ceylon,\r\nand proved to be identical with the _Aral_ of the Coromandel coast, that\r\nit may be doubtful whether it be not the individual already noted by\r\nCuvier as _Rhyncobdella ocellata_, Cuv. and Val. viii. 445.]\r\n\r\nIn this collection, brought together without premeditation, the\r\nnaturalist will be struck by the preponderance of those genera which are\r\nadapted by nature to endure a temporary privation of moisture; and this,\r\ntaken in connection with the vicissitudes affecting the waters they\r\ninhabit, exhibits a surprising illustration of the wisdom of the Creator\r\nin adapting the organisation of His creatures to the peculiar\r\ncircumstances under which they are destined to exist.\r\n\r\nSo abundant are fish in all parts of the island, that Knox says, not the\r\nrunning streams alone, but the reservoirs and ponds, \"nay, every ditch\r\nand little plash of water but ankle deep hath fish in it.\"[1] But many\r\nof these reservoirs and tanks are, twice in each year, liable to be\r\nevaporated to dryness till the mud of the bottom is converted into dust,\r\nand the clay cleft by the heat into gaping apertures. Yet within a very\r\nfew days after the change of the monsoon, the natives are busily engaged\r\nin fishing in those very spots and in the hollows contiguous to them,\r\nalthough entirely unconnected with any pool or running streams; in the\r\nway in which Knox described nearly 200 years ago, with a funnel-shaped\r\nbasket, open at bottom and top, which, as he says, they \"jibb down, and\r\nthe end sticks in the mud, which often happens upon a fish; which, when\r\nthey feel beating itself against the sides, they put in their hands and\r\ntake it out, and reive a ratan through their gills, and so let them drag\r\nafter them.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: KNOX'S _Historical Relation of Ceylon_, Part 1. ch. vii.\r\nThe occurrence of fish in the most unlooked-for situations, is one of\r\nthe mysteries of other eastern countries as well as Ceylon and India. In\r\nPersia irrigation is carried on to a great extent by means of wells sunk\r\nin line in the direction in which it is desired to lead a supply of\r\nwater, and these are connected by channels, which are carefully arched\r\nover to protect them from evaporation. These _kanats_, as they are\r\ncalled, are full of fish, although neither they nor the wells they unite\r\nhave any connection with streams or lakes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: KNOX, _Historical Relation of Ceylon_, Part I. ch. vii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM KNOX'S CEYLON, A.D. 1681]\r\n\r\nThis operation may be seen in the lowlands, which are traversed by the\r\nhigh road leading from Colombo to Kandy, the hollows on either side of\r\nwhich, before the change of the monsoon, are covered with dust or\r\nstunted grass; but when flooded by the rains, they are immediately\r\nresorted to by the peasants with baskets, constructed precisely as Knox\r\nhas stated, in which the fish are encircled and taken out by the\r\nhand.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: As anglers, the native Singhalese exhibit little\r\nexpertness; but for fishing the rivers, they construct with singular\r\ningenuity fences formed of strong stakes, protected by screens of ratan,\r\nwhich stretch diagonally across the current; and along these the fish\r\nare conducted into a series of enclosures from which retreat is\r\nimpracticable. Mr. LAYARD, in the _Magazine of Natural History_ for May,\r\n1853, has given a diagram of one of these fish \"corrals,\" as they are\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FISH CORRAL]]\r\n\r\nSo singular a phenomenon as the sudden reappearance of full-grown fishes\r\nin places which a few days before had been encrusted with hardened clay,\r\nhas not failed to attract attention; but the European residents have\r\nbeen contented to explain it by hazarding the conjecture, either that\r\nthe spawn had lain imbedded in the dried earth till released by the\r\nrains, or that the fish, so unexpectedly discovered, fall from the\r\nclouds during the deluge of the monsoon.\r\n\r\nAs to the latter conjecture; the fall of fish during showers, even were\r\nit not so problematical in theory, is too rare an event to account for\r\nthe punctual appearance of those found in the rice-fields, at stated\r\nperiods of the year. Both at Galle and Colombo in the south-west\r\nmonsoon, fish are popularly thought to have fallen from the clouds\r\nduring violent showers, but those found on the occasions that give rise\r\nto this belief, consist of the smallest fry, such as could be caught up\r\nby waterspouts, and vortices analogous to them, or otherwise blown on\r\nshore from the surf; whereas those which suddenly appear in the\r\nreplenished tanks and in the hollows which they overflow, are mature and\r\nwell-grown fish.[1] Besides, the latter are found, under the\r\ncircumstances I have described, in all parts of the interior, whilst the\r\nprodigy of a supposed fall of fish from the sky has been noticed, I\r\napprehend, only in the vicinity of the sea, or of some inland water.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: I had an opportunity, on one occasion only, of witnessing\r\nthe phenomenon which gives rise to this popular belief. I was driving in\r\nthe cinnamon gardens near the fort of Colombo, and saw a violent but\r\npartial shower descend at no great distance before me. On coming to the\r\nspot I found a multitude of small silvery fish from one and a half to\r\ntwo inches in length, leaping on the gravel of the high road, numbers of\r\nwhich I collected and brought away in my palankin. The spot was about\r\nhalf a mile from the sea, and entirely unconnected with any watercourse\r\nor pool.\r\n\r\nMr. WHITING, who was many years resident at Trincomalie, writes me that\r\nhe \"had often been told by the natives on that side of the island that\r\nit sometimes rained fishes; and on one occasion (he adds) I was taken by\r\nthem, in 1849, to a field at the village of Karran-cotta-tivo, near\r\nBatticaloa, which was dry when I passed over it in the morning, but had\r\nbeen covered in two hours by sudden rain to the depth of three inches in\r\nwhich there was then a quantity of small fish. The water had no\r\nconnection with any pond or stream whatsoever.\" Mr. CRIPPS, in like\r\nmanner, in speaking of Galle, says: \"I have seen in the vicinity of the\r\nfort, fish taken from rain-water that had accumulated in the hollow\r\nparts of land that in the hot season are perfectly dry and parched. The\r\nplace is accessible to no running stream or tank; and either the fish,\r\nor the spawn from which they were produced, must of necessity have\r\nfallen with the rain.\"\r\n\r\nMr. J. PRINSEP, the eminent secretary to the Asiatic Society of Bengal,\r\nfound a fish in the pluviometer at Calcutta, in 1838.--_Journ. Asiat.\r\nSoc. Bengal_, vol. vi p. 465.\r\n\r\nA series of instances in which fishes have been found on the continent\r\nof India under circumstances which lead to the conclusion that they must\r\nhave fallen from the clouds, have been collected by Dr. BUIST of Bombay,\r\nand will be found in the appendix to this chapter.]\r\n\r\nThe surmise of the buried spawn is one sanctioned by the very highest\r\nauthority. Mr. YARRELL in his \"_History of British Fishes_,\" adverting\r\nto the fact that ponds which had been previously converted into hardened\r\nmud, are replenished with small fish in a very few days after the\r\ncommencement of each rainy season, offers this solution of the problem\r\nas probably the true one: \"The impregnated ova of the fish of one rainy\r\nseason, are left unhatched in the mud through the dry season, and from\r\ntheir low state of organisation as ova, the vitality is preserved till\r\nthe recurrence, and contact of the rain and oxygen in the next wet\r\nseason, when vivification takes place from their joint influence.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: YARRELL, _History of British Fishes_, introd. vol. i. p.\r\nxxvi.]\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis, however, appears to have been offered upon imperfect\r\ndata; for although some fish like the salmon scrape grooves in the sand\r\nand place their spawn in inequalities and fissures; yet as a general\r\nrule spawn is deposited not beneath but on the surface of the ground or\r\nsand over which the water flows, the adhesive nature of each egg\r\nsupplying the means of attachment. But in the Ceylon tanks not only is\r\nthe surface of the soil dried to dust after the evaporation of the\r\nwater, but the earth itself, twelve or eighteen inches deep, is\r\nconverted into sun-burnt clay, in which, although the eggs of mollusca,\r\nin their calcareous covering, are in some instances preserved, it would\r\nappear to be as impossible for the ova of fish to be kept from\r\ndecomposition as for the fish themselves to sustain life. Besides,\r\nmoisture in such situations is only to be found at a depth to which\r\nspawn could not be conveyed by the parent fish, by any means with which\r\nwe are yet acquainted.\r\n\r\nBut supposing it possible to carry the spawn sufficiently deep, and to\r\ndeposit it safely in the mud below, which is still damp, whence it could\r\nbe liberated on the return of the rains, a considerable interval would\r\nstill be necessary after the replenishing of the ponds with water to\r\nadmit of vivification and growth. But so far from this interval being\r\nallowed to elapse, the rains have no sooner ceased than the fishing of\r\nthe natives commences, and those captured in wicker cages are mature and\r\nfull grown instead of being \"small fish\" or fry, as affirmed by Mr.\r\nYarrell.\r\n\r\nEven admitting the soundness of his theory, and the probability that,\r\nunder favourable circumstances, the spawn in the tanks might be\r\npreserved during the dry season so as to contribute to the perpetuation\r\nof their inhabitants, the fact is no longer doubtful, that adult fish in\r\nCeylon, like some of those that inhabit similar waters both in the New\r\nand Old World, have been endowed by the Creator with the singular\r\nfaculty of providing against the periodical droughts either by\r\njourneying overland in search of still unexhausted water, or, on its\r\nutter disappearance, by burying themselves in the mud to await the\r\nreturn of the rains.\r\n\r\n_Travelling Fishes._--It was well known to the Greeks that certain\r\nfishes of India possessed the power of leaving the rivers and returning\r\nto them again after long migrations[1] on dry land, and modern\r\nobservation has fully confirmed their statements. The fish leave the\r\npools and nullahs in the dry season, and led by an instinct as yet\r\nunexplained, shape their course through the grass towards the nearest\r\npool of water. A similar phenomenon is observable in countries similarly\r\ncircumstanced. The Doras of Guiana[2] have been seen travelling over\r\nland during the dry season in search of their natural element[3], in\r\nsuch droves that the negroes have filled baskets with them during these\r\nterrestrial excursions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: I have collected into a note, which will be found in the\r\nappendix to this chapter, the opinions entertained by the Greeks and\r\nRomans upon this habit of the fresh-water fishes of India. See note B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _D. Hancockii_, Cuv. et Val.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Sir R. Schomburgk's _Fishes of Guiana_, vol. i. pp. 113,\r\n151, 160. Another migratory fish was found by Bose very numerous in the\r\nfresh waters of Carolina and in ponds liable to become dry in summer.\r\nWhen captured and placed on the ground, \"they _always directed\r\nthemselves towards the nearest water, which they could not possibly\r\nsee_, and which they must have discovered by some internal index.\" They\r\nbelong to the genus _Hydrargyra_, and are called Swampines.-- KIBBY,\r\n_Bridgewater Treatise_, vol i. p. 143.\r\n\r\nEels kept in a garden, when August arrived (the period at which instinct\r\nimpels them to go to the sea to spawn) were in the habit of leaving the\r\npond and were invariably found moving eastward _in the direction of the\r\nsea_.--YARRELL, vol. ii. p. 384. Anglers observe that fish newly caught,\r\nwhen placed out of sight of water, always struggle towards it to\r\nescape.]\r\n\r\nPallegoix in his account of Siam, enumerates three species of fishes\r\nwhich leave the tanks and channels and traverse the damp grass[1]; and\r\nSir John Bowring, in his account of the embassy to the Siamese kings in\r\n1855, states, that in ascending and descending the river Meinam to\r\nBankok, he was amused with the novel sight of fish leaving the river,\r\ngliding over the wet banks, and losing themselves amongst the trees of\r\nthe jungle.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: PALLEGOIX, vol. i. p. 144.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Sir J. BOWRING'S _Siam_, vol. i. p. 10.]\r\n\r\nThe class of fishes which possess this power are chiefly those with\r\nlabyrinthiform pharyngeal bones, so disposed in plates and cells as to\r\nretain a supply of moisture, which, whilst crawling on land, gradually\r\nexudes so as to keep the gills damp.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: CUVIER and VALENCIENNES, _Hist. Nat. des Poissons, _tom.\r\nvii. p. 246.]\r\n\r\nThe individual which is most frequently seen in these excursions in\r\nCeylon is a perch called by the Singhalese _Kavaya_ or _Kawhy-ya_, and\r\nby the Tamils _Pannei-eri_, or _Sennal_. It is closely allied to, if not\r\nidentical with, the _Anabas scandens_ of Cuvier, the _Perca scandens_ of\r\nDaldorf. It grows to about six inches in length, the head round and\r\ncovered with scales, and the edges of the gill-covers strongly\r\ndenticulated. Aided by the apparatus already adverted to in its head,\r\nthis little creature issues boldly from its native pools and addresses\r\nitself to its toilsome march generally at night or in the early morning,\r\nwhilst the grass is still damp with the dew; but in its distress it is\r\nsometimes compelled to travel by day, and Mr. E.L. Layard on one\r\noccasion encountered a number of them travelling along a hot and dusty\r\ngravel road under the midday sun.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist_., May, 1853, p. 390. Mr.\r\nMorris, the government-agent of Trincomalie, writing to me on this\r\nsubject in 1856, says--\"I was lately on duty inspecting the bund of a\r\nlarge tank at Nade-cadua, which, being out of repair, the remaining\r\nwater was confined in a small hollow in the otherwise dry bed. Whilst\r\nthere heavy rain came on, and, as we stood on the high ground, we\r\nobserved a pelican on the margin of the shallow pool gorging himself;\r\nour people went towards him and raised a cry of fish! fish! We hurried\r\ndown, and found numbers of fish struggling upwards through the grass in\r\nthe rills formed by the trickling of the rain. There was scarcely water\r\nenough to cover them, but nevertheless they made rapid progress up the\r\nbank, on which our followers collected about two bushels of them at a\r\ndistance of forty yards from the tank. They were forcing their way up\r\nthe knoll, and, had they not been intercepted first by the pelican and\r\nafterwards by ourselves, they would in a few minutes have gained the\r\nhighest point and descended on the other side into a pool which formed\r\nanother portion of the tank. They were chub, the same as are found in\r\nthe mud after the tanks dry up.\" In a subsequent communication in July,\r\n1857, the same gentleman says--\"As the tanks dry up the fish congregate\r\nin the little pools till at last you find them in thousands in the\r\nmoistest parts of the beds, rolling in the blue mud which is at that\r\ntime about the consistence of thick gruel.\"\r\n\r\n\"As the moisture further evaporates the surface fish are left uncovered,\r\nand they crawl away in search of fresh pools. In one place I saw\r\nhundreds diverging in every direction, from the tank they had just\r\nabandoned to a distance of fifty or sixty yards, and still travelling\r\nonwards. In going this distance, however, they must have used muscular\r\nexertion sufficient to have taken them half a mile on level ground, for\r\nat these places all the cattle and wild animals of the neighbourhood had\r\nlatterly come to drink; so that the surface was everywhere indented with\r\nfootmarks in addition to the cracks in the surrounding baked mud, into\r\nwhich the fish tumbled in their progress. In those holes which were deep\r\nand the sides perpendicular they remained to die, and were carried off\r\nby kites and crows.\"\r\n\r\n\"My impression is that this migration takes place at night or before\r\nsunrise, for it was only early in the morning that I have seen them\r\nprogressing, and I found that those I brought away with me in chatties\r\nappeared quiet by day, but a large proportion managed to get out of the\r\nchatties at night--some escaped altogether, others were trodden on and\r\nkilled.\"\r\n\r\n\"One peculiarity is the large size of the vertebral column, quite\r\ndisproportioned to the bulk of the fish. I particularly noticed that all\r\nin the act of migrating had their gills expanded.\"]\r\n\r\nReferring to the _Anabas scandens_, Mr. Hamilton Buchanan says, that of\r\nall the fish with which he was acquainted it is the most tenacious of\r\nlife; and he has known boatmen on the Ganges to keep them for five or\r\nsix days in an earthen pot without water, and daily to use what they\r\nwanted, finding them as lively and fresh as when caught.[1] Two Danish\r\nnaturalists residing at Tranquebar, have contributed their authority to\r\nthe fact of this fish ascending trees on the coast of Coromandel, an\r\nexploit from which it acquired its epithet of _Perca scandens_. Daldorf,\r\nwho was a lieutenant in the Danish East India Company's service,\r\ncommunicated to Sir Joseph Banks, that in the year 1791 he had taken\r\nthis fish from a moist cavity in the stem of a Palmyra palm, which grew\r\nnear a lake. He saw it when already five feet above the ground\r\nstruggling to ascend still higher;--suspending itself by its\r\ngill-covers, and bending its tail to the left, it fixed its anal fin in\r\nthe cavity of the bark, and sought by expanding its body to urge its way\r\nupwards, and its march was only arrested by the hand with which he\r\nseized it.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Fishes of the Ganges_, 4to. 1822.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Transactions Linn. Soc._ vol. iii. p. 63. It is\r\nremarkable, however, that this discovery of Daldorf, which excited so\r\ngreat an interest in 1791, had been anticipated by an Arabian voyager a\r\nthousand years before. Abou-zeyd, the compiler of the remarkable MS.\r\nknown since Renandot's translation by the title of the _Travels of Two\r\nMahometans_, states that Suleyman, one of his informants, who visited\r\nIndia at the close of the ninth century, was told there of a fish which,\r\nissuing from the waters, ascended the coco-nut palms to drink their sap,\r\nand returned to the sea. \"On parle d'un poisson de mer que sortant de\r\nl'eau, monte sur la cocotier et boit le suc de la plante; ensuite il\r\nretourne à la mer.\" See REINAUD, _Relations des Voyages faits par les\r\nArabes et Persans dans le neuvième siècle_, tom. i. p. 21, tom ii. p.\r\n93.]\r\n\r\nThere is considerable obscurity about the story of this ascent, although\r\ncorroborated by M. John. Its motive for climbing is not apparent, since\r\nwater being close at hand it could not have gone for sake of the\r\nmoisture contained in the fissures of the palm; nor could it be in\r\nsearch of food, as it lives not on fruit but on aquatic insects.[1] The\r\ndescent, too, is a question of difficulty. The position of its fins, and\r\nthe spines on its gill-covers, might assist its journey upwards, but the\r\nsame apparatus would prove anything but a facility in steadying its\r\njourney down. The probability is, as suggested by Buchanan, that the\r\nascent which was witnessed by Daldorf was accidental, and ought not to\r\nbe regarded as the habit of the animal. In Ceylon I heard of no instance\r\nof the perch ascending trees[2], but the fact is well established that\r\nboth it, the _pullata_ (a species of polyacanthus), and others, are\r\ncapable of long journeys on the level ground.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Kirby says that it is \"in pursuit of certain crustaceans\r\nthat form its food\" (_Bridgewater Treatise_, vol. i. p. 144); but I am\r\nnot aware of any crustaceans in the island which ascend the palmyra or\r\nfeed upon its fruit. Birgus latro, which inhabits Mauritius and is said\r\nto climb the coco-nut for this purpose, has not been observed in\r\nCeylon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This assertion must be qualified by a fact stated by Mr.\r\nE.A. Layard, who mentions that on visiting one of the fishing stations\r\non a Singhalese river, where the fish are caught in staked enclosures,\r\nas described at p. 212, and observing that the chambers were covered\r\nwith netting, he asked the reason, and was told \"_that some of the fish\r\nclimbed up the sticks and got over_.\"--_Mag. Nat. Hist._ for May 1828,\r\np. 390-1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Strange accidents have more than once occurred in Ceylon\r\narising from the habit of the native anglers; who, having neither\r\nbaskets nor pockets in which to place what they catch, will seize a fish\r\nin their teeth whilst putting fresh bait on their hook. In August 1853,\r\na man carried into the Pettah hospital at Colombo, having a climbing\r\nperch, which he thus attempted to hold, firmly imbedded in his throat.\r\nThe spines of its dorsal fin prevented its descent, whilst those of the\r\ngill-covers equally forbade its return. It was eventually extracted by\r\nthe forceps through an incision in the oesophagus, and the patient\r\nrecovered. Other similar cases have proved fatal.]\r\n\r\n_Burying Fishes._--But a still more remarkable power possessed by some\r\nof the Ceylon fishes, is that of secreting themselves in the earth in\r\nthe dry season, at the bottom of the exhausted ponds, and there awaiting\r\nthe renewal of the water at the change of the monsoon.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of the crocodile to resort to the same expedient has been\r\nalready referred to[1], and in like manner the fish, when distressed by\r\nthe evaporation of the tanks, seek relief by immersing first their\r\nheads, and by degrees their whole bodies, in the mud; and sinking to a\r\ndepth at which they find sufficient moisture to preserve life in a state\r\nof lethargy long after the bed of the tank has been consolidated by the\r\nintense heat of the sun. It is possible, too, that the cracks which\r\nreticulate the surface may admit air to some extent to sustain their\r\nfaint respiration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See _ante_, P. II. ch. iii. p. 189.]\r\n\r\nThe same thing takes place in other tropical regions, subject to\r\nvicissitudes of draught and moisture. The Protopterus[1] which inhabits\r\nthe Gambia (and which, though demonstrated by Professor Owen to possess\r\nall the essential organisation of fishes, is nevertheless provided with\r\ntrue lungs), is accustomed in the dry season, when the river retires\r\ninto its channel, to bury itself to the depth of twelve or sixteen\r\ninches in the indurated mud of the banks, and to remain in a state of\r\ntorpor till the rising of the stream after the rains enables it to\r\nresume its active habits. At this period the natives of the Gambia, like\r\nthose of Ceylon, resort to the river, and secure the fish in\r\nconsiderable numbers as they flounder in the still shallow water. A\r\nparallel instance occurs in Abyssinia in relation to the fish of the\r\nMareb, one of the sources of the Nile, the waters of which are partially\r\nabsorbed in traversing the plains of Taka. During the summer its bed is\r\ndry, and in the slime at the depth of more than six feet is found a\r\nspecies of fish without scales, different from any known to inhabit the\r\nNile.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Lepidosiren annectans_, Owen. See _Linn. Trans._ 1839.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This statement will be found in QUATREMERE'S _Memoires sur\r\nl'Egypte_, tom. i. p. 17, on the authority of Abdullah ben Ahmed ben\r\nSolaim Assouany, in his _History of Nubia_, \"Simon, héritier présomptif\r\ndu royanme d'Alouah, m'a assuré que l'on trouve, dans la vase qui couvre\r\nle fond de cette rivière, un grand poisson sans écailles, qui ne\r\nressemble en rien aux poissons du Nil, et que, pour l'avoir, il faut\r\ncreuser à une toise et plus de profondeur.\" To this passage there is\r\nappended this note:--\"Le patriarche Mendes, cité par Legrand (_Relation\r\nHist. d'Abyssinie_, du P. LOBO, p. 212-3) rapporte que le fleuve Mareb,\r\naprès avoir arrosé une étendue de pays considérable, se perd sous terre;\r\net que quand les Portugais faisaient la guerre dans ce pays, ils\r\nfouilloient dans le sable, et y trouvoient de la bonne eau et du bon\r\npoison. Au rapport de l'auteur de _l'Ayin Akbery_ (tom. ii. p. 146, ed.\r\n1800), dans le Soubah de Caschmir, près du lieu nommé Tilahmoulah, est\r\nune grande pièce de terre qui est inondée pendant la saison des pluies.\r\nLorsque les eaux se sont évaporées, et que la vase est presque sèche,\r\nles habitans prennent des bâtons d'environ une aune de long, qu'ils\r\nenfoncent dans la vase, et ils y trouvent quantité de grands et petits\r\npoissons.\" In the library of the British Museum there is an unique MS.\r\nof MANOEL DE ALMEIDA, written in the sixteenth century, from which\r\nBalthasar Tellez compiled his _Historia General de Ethiopia alta_,\r\nprinted at Coimbra in 1660, and in it the above statement of Mendes is\r\ncorroborated by Almeida, who says that he was told by João Gabriel, a\r\nCreole Portuguese, born in Abyssinia, who had visited the Merab, and who\r\nsaid that the \"fish were to be found everywhere eight or ten palms down,\r\nand that he had eaten of them.\"]\r\n\r\nIn South America the \"round-headed hassar\" of Guiana, _Callicthys\r\nlittoralis_, and the \"yarrow,\" a species of the family Esocidæ, although\r\nthey possess no specially modified respiratory organs, are accustomed to\r\nbury themselves in the mud on the subsidence of water in the pools\r\nduring the dry season.[1] The _Loricaria_ of Surinam, another Siluridan,\r\nexhibits a similar instinct, and resorts to the same expedient. Sir R.\r\nSchomburgk, in his account of the fishes of Guiana, confirms this\r\naccount of the Callicthys, and says \"they can exist in muddy lakes\r\nwithout any water whatever, and great numbers of them are sometimes dug\r\nup from such situations.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Paper \"_on some Species of Fishes and Reptiles in\r\nDemerara_,\" by J. HANDCOOK, Esq., M.D., _Zoological Journal_, vol. iv.\r\np. 243.]\r\n\r\nIn those portions of Ceylon where the country is flat, and small tanks\r\nare extremely numerous, the natives in the hot season are accustomed to\r\ndig in the mud for fish. Mr. Whiting, the chief civil officer of the\r\neastern province, informs me that, on two occasions, he was present\r\naccidentally when the villagers were so engaged, once at the tank of\r\nMoeletivoe, within a few miles of Kottiar, near the bay of Trincomalie,\r\nand again at a tank between Ellendetorre and Arnetivoe, on the bank of\r\nthe Vergel river. The clay was firm, but moist, and as the men flung out\r\nlumps of it with a spade, it fell to pieces, disclosing fish from nine\r\nto twelve inches long, which were full grown and healthy, and jumped on\r\nthe bank when exposed to the sun light.\r\n\r\nBeing desirous of obtaining a specimen of the fish so exhumed, I\r\nreceived from the Moodliar of Matura, A.B. Wickremeratne, a fish taken\r\nalong with others of the same kind from a tank in which the water had\r\ndried up; it was found at a depth of a foot and a half where the mud was\r\nstill moist, whilst the surface was dry and hard. The fish which the\r\nmoodliar sent to me proved to be an Anabas, and closely resembles the\r\n_Perca scandens_ of Daldorf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ANABAS OF THE DRY TANKS]\r\n\r\nBut the faculty of becoming torpid at such periods is not confined in\r\nCeylon to the crocodiles and fishes, it is equally possessed by some of\r\nthe fresh-water mollusca and aquatic coleoptera. The largest of the\r\nformer, the _Ampullaria glauca_, is found in still water in all parts of\r\nthe island, not alone in the tanks, but in rice-fields and the\r\nwatercourses by which they are irrigated. There it deposits a bundle of\r\neggs with a white calcareous shell, to the number of one hundred and\r\nmore in each group, at a considerable depth in the soft mud, under\r\nwhich, when the water is about to evaporate during the dry season, it\r\nburrows and conceals itself[1] till the returning rains restore it to\r\nliberty, and reproduce its accustomed food. The _Melania Paludina_ in\r\nthe same way retires during the droughts into the muddy soil of the rice\r\nlands; and it can only be by such an instinct that this and other\r\nmollusca are preserved when the tanks evaporate, to re-appear in full\r\ngrowth and vigour immediately on the return of the rains.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A knowledge of this fact was turned to prompt account by\r\nMr. Edgar S. Layard, when holding a judicial office at Point Pedro in\r\n1849. A native who had been defrauded of his land complained before him\r\nof his neighbour, who, during his absence, had removed their common\r\nlandmark by diverting the original watercourse and obliterated its\r\ntraces by filling it to a level with the rest of the field. Mr. Layard\r\ndirected a trench to be sunk at the contested spot, and discovering\r\nnumbers of the Ampullaria, the remains of the eggs, and the living\r\nanimal which had been buried for months, the evidence was so resistless\r\nas to confound the wrongdoer, and terminate the suit.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For a similar fact relative to the shells and water beetles\r\nin the pools near Rio Janeiro, see DARWIN'S _Nat. Journal_, ch. v. p.\r\n90. BENSON, in the first vol. of _Gleanings of Science_, published at\r\nCalcutta in 1829, describes a species of _Paludina_ found in pools,\r\nwhich are periodically dried up in the hot season but reappear with the\r\nrains, p. 363. And in the _Journal of the Asiatic Soc. of Bengal_ for\r\nSept. 1832, Lieut. HUTTON, in a singularly interesting paper, has\r\nfollowed up the same subject by a narrative of his own observations at\r\nMirzapore, where in June, 1832, after a few heavy showers of rain, which\r\nformed pools on the surface of the ground near a mango grove, he saw the\r\n_Paludinæ_ issuing from the ground, \"pushing aside the moistened earth\r\nand coming forth from their retreats; but on the disappearance of the\r\nwater not one of them was to be seen above ground. Wishing to ascertain\r\nwhat had become of them, he turned up the earth at the base of several\r\ntrees, and invariably found the shells buried from an inch to two inches\r\nbelow the surface.\" Lieut. Hutton adds that the _Ampullariæ_ and\r\n_Planorbes_, as well as the _Paludinæ_, are found in similar situations\r\nduring the heats of the dry season. The British _Pisidea_ exhibit the\r\nsame faculty (see a monograph in the _Camb. Phil. Trans._ vol. iv.). The\r\nfact is elsewhere alluded to in the present work of the power possessed\r\nby the land leech of Ceylon of retaining vitality even after being\r\nparched to hardness during the heat of the rainless season. Vol. I. ch.\r\nvii. p. 312.]\r\n\r\nDr. John Hunter[1] has advanced the opinion that hybernation, although a\r\nresult of cold, is not its immediate consequence, but is attributable to\r\nthat deprivation of food and other essentials which extreme cold\r\noccasions, and against the recurrence of which nature makes a timely\r\nprovision by a suspension of her functions. Excessive heat in the\r\ntropics produces an effect upon animals and vegetables analogous to that\r\nof excessive cold in northern regions, and hence it is reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the torpor induced by the one may be but the counterpart of\r\nthe hybernation which results from the other. The frost which imprisons\r\nthe alligator in the Mississippi as effectually cuts him off from food\r\nand action as the drought which incarcerates the crocodile in the\r\nsun-burnt clay of a Ceylon tank. The hedgehog of Europe enters on a\r\nperiod of absolute torpidity as soon as the inclemency of winter\r\ndeprives it of its ordinary supply of slugs and insects; and the\r\n_Tenrec_[2] of Madagascar, its tropical representative, exhibits the\r\nsame tendency during the period when excessive heat produces in that\r\nclimate a like result.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: HUNTER'S _Observations on parts of the Animal Oeconomy_, p.\r\n88.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Centetes ecaudatus_, Illiger.]\r\n\r\nThe descent of the _Ampullaria_, and other fresh-water molluscs, into\r\nthe mud of the tank, has its parallel in the conduct of the _Bulimi_ and\r\n_Helices_ on land. The European snail, in the beginning of winter,\r\neither buries itself in the earth or withdraws to some crevice or\r\noverarching stone to await the returning vegetation of spring. So, in\r\nthe season of intense heat, the _Helix Waltoni_ of Ceylon, and others of\r\nthe same family, before retiring under cover, close the aperture of\r\ntheir shells with an impervious epiphragm, which effectually protects\r\ntheir moisture and juices from evaporation during the period of their\r\næstivation. The Bulimi of Chili have been found alive in England in a\r\nbox packed in cotton after an interval of two years, and the animal\r\ninhabiting a land-shell from Suez, which was attached to a tablet and\r\ndeposited in the British Museum in 1846, was found in 1850 to have\r\nformed a fresh epiphragm, and on being immersed in tepid water, it\r\nemerged from its shell. It became torpid again on the 15th November,\r\n1851, and was found dead and dried up in March, 1852.[1] But the\r\nexceptions serve to prove the accuracy of Hunter's opinion almost as\r\nstrikingly as accordances, since the same genera of animals which\r\nhybernate in Europe, where extreme cold disarranges their oeconomy,\r\nevince no symptoms of lethargy in the tropics, provided their food be\r\nnot diminished by the heat. Ants, which are torpid in Europe during\r\nwinter, work all the year round in India, where sustenance is\r\nuniform.[2] The Shrews of Ceylon (_Sorex montanus_ and _S. ferrugineus_\r\nof Kelaart) which, like those at home, subsist upon insects, inhabit a\r\nregion where the equable temperature admits of the pursuit of their prey\r\nat all seasons of the year; and hence, unlike those of Europe, they\r\nnever hybernate. A similar observation applies to the bats, which are\r\ndormant during a northern winter when insects are rare, but never become\r\ntorpid in any part of the tropics.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Annals of Natural History_, 1850. See Dr. BAIRD's _Account\r\nof Helix desertorum; Excelsior, &c._, ch. i. p. 345.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Colonel SYKES has described in the _Entomological Trans._\r\nthe operations of an ant which laid up a store of hay against the rainy\r\nseason.]\r\n\r\nThe bear, in like manner, is nowhere deprived of its activity except\r\nwhen the rigour of severe frost cuts off its access to its accustomed\r\nfood. On the other hand, the tortoise, which immerses itself in\r\nindurated mud during the hot months in Venezuela, shows no tendency to\r\ntorpor in Ceylon, where its food is permanent; and yet is subject to\r\nhybernation when carried to the colder regions of Europe.\r\n\r\nTo the fish in the detached tanks and pools when the heat, by exhausting\r\nthe water, deprives them at once of motion and sustenance, the practical\r\neffect must be the same as when the frost of a northern winter encases\r\nthem in ice. Nor is it difficult to believe that they can successfully\r\nundergo the one crisis when we know beyond question that they may\r\nsurvive the other.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: YARRELL, vol. i. p. 364, quotes the authority of Dr. J.\r\nHunter in his _Animal OEconomy_, that fish, \"after being frozen still\r\nretain so much of life as when thawed to resume their vital actions;\"\r\nand in the same volume (_Introd._ vol. i. p. xvii.) he relates from\r\nJESSE'S _Gleanings in Natural History_, the story of a gold fish\r\n(_Cyprinus auratus_) which, together with the water in a marble basin,\r\nwas frozen into one solid lump of ice, yet, on the water being thawed,\r\nthe fish became as lively as usual Dr. RICHARDSON, in the third vol. of\r\nhis _Fauna Borealis Americana_, says the grey sucking carp found in the\r\nfur countries of North America, may be frozen and thawed again without\r\nbeing killed in the process.]\r\n\r\n_Hot-water Fishes_.--Another incident is striking in connection with the\r\nfresh-water fishes of Ceylon. I have mentioned elsewhere the hot springs\r\nof Kannea, in the vicinity of Trincomalie, the water in which flows at a\r\ntemperature varying at different seasons from 85° to 115°. In the stream\r\nformed by these wells M. Reynaud found and forwarded to Cuvier two\r\nfishes which he took from the water at a time when his thermometer\r\nindicated a temperature of 37° Reaumur, equal to 115° of Fahrenheit. The\r\none was an Apogon, the other an Ambassis, and to each, from the heat of\r\nits habitat, he assigned the specific name of \"Thermalis.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: CUV. and VAL., vol. iii. p. 363. In addition to the two\r\nfishes above named, a loche _Cobitis thermalis_, and a carp, _Nuria\r\nthermoicos_, were found in the hot-springs of Kannea at a heat 40°\r\nCent., 114° Fahr., and a roach, _Leuciscus thermalis_, when the\r\nthermometer indicated 50° Cent., 122° Fahr.--_Ib_. xviii. p. 59, xvi. p.\r\n182, xvii. p. 94. Fish have been taken from a hot spring at Pooree when\r\nthe thermometer stood at 112° Fahr., and as they belonged to a\r\ncarnivorous genus, they must have found prey living in the same high\r\ntemperature.--_Journ. Asiatic Soc. Beng_. vol. vi. p. 465. Fishes have\r\nbeen observed in a hot spring at Manilla which raises the thermometer to\r\n187°, and in another in Barbary, the usual temperature of which is 172°;\r\nand Humboidt and Bonpland, when travelling in South America, saw fishes\r\nthrown up alive from a volcano, in water that raised the temperature to\r\n210°, being two degrees below the boiling point.

In July, 1826, live fish were seen to fall\r\non the grass at Moradabad during a storm. They were the common cyprinus,\r\nso prevalent in our Indian waters. On the 19th of February, 1830, at\r\nnoon, a heavy fall of fish occurred at the Nokulhatty factory, in the\r\nDaccah zillah; depositions on the subject were obtained from nine\r\ndifferent parties. The fish were all dead; most of them were large: some\r\nwere fresh, others were rotten and mutilated. They were seen at first in\r\nthe sky, like a flock of birds, descending rapidly to the ground; there\r\nwas rain drizzling, but no storm. On the 16th and 17th of May, 1833, a\r\nfall of fish occurred in the zillah of Futtehpoor, about three miles\r\nnorth of the Jumna, after a violent storm of wind and rain. The fish\r\nwere from a pound and a half to three pounds in weight, and of the same\r\nspecies as those found in the tanks in the neighbourhood. They were all\r\ndead and dry. A fall of fish occurred at Allahabad, during a storm in\r\nMay, 1835; they were of the chowla species, and were found dead and dry\r\nafter the storm had passed over the district. On the 20th of September,\r\n1839, after a smart shower of rain, a quantity of live fish, about three\r\ninches in length and all of the same kind, fell at the Sunderbunds,\r\nabout twenty miles south of Calcutta. On this occasion it was remarked\r\nthat the fish did not fall here and there irregularly over the ground,\r\nbut in a continuous straight line, not more than a span in breadth. The\r\nvast multitudes of fish, with which the low grounds round Bombay are\r\ncovered, about a week or ten days after the first burst of the monsoon,\r\nappear to be derived from the adjoining pools or rivulets and not to\r\ndescend from the sky. They are not, so far as I know, found in the\r\nhigher parts of the island. I have never seen them, though I have\r\nwatched carefully, in casks collecting water from the roofs of\r\nbuildings, or heard of them on the decks or awnings of vessels in the\r\nharbour, where they must have appeared had they descended from the sky.\r\nOne of the most remarkable phenomena of this kind occurred during a\r\ntremendous deluge of rain at Kattywar, on the 25th of July, 1850, when\r\nthe ground around Rajkote was found literally covered with fish; some of\r\nthem were found on the tops of haystacks, where probably they had been\r\ndrifted by the storm. In the course of twenty-four successive hours\r\ntwenty-seven inches of rain fell, thirty-five fell in twenty-six hours,\r\nseven inches within one hour and a half, being the heaviest fall on\r\nrecord. At Poonah, on the 3rd of August, 1852, after a very heavy fall\r\nof rain, multitudes of fish were caught on the ground in the\r\ncantonments, full half a mile from the nearest stream. If showers of\r\nfish are to be explained on the assumption that they are carried up by\r\nsqualls or violent winds, from rivers or spaces of water not far away\r\nfrom where they fall, it would be nothing wonderful were they seen to\r\ndescend from the air during the furious squalls which occasionally occur\r\nin June.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE (B.)\r\n\r\nMIGRATION  OF  FISHES  OVER  LAND.\r\n\r\n_Opinions of the Greeks and Romans_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an illustration of the eagerness with which, after the expedition\r\nof Alexander the Great, particulars connected with the natural history\r\nof India were sought for and arranged by the Greeks, that in the works\r\nboth of ARISTOTLE and THEOPHRASTUS the facts are recorded of the fishes\r\nin the Indian rivers migrating in search of water, of their burying\r\nthemselves in the mud on its failure, of their being dug out thence\r\nalive during the dry season, and of their spontaneous reappearance on\r\nthe return of the rains. The earliest notice is in the treatise of\r\nARISTOTLE _De Respiratione_, chap. ix., who mentions the strange\r\ndiscovery of living fish found beneath the surface of the soil, [Greek:\r\ntôn ichthuôn oi polloi zôsin en tê gê, akinêtizontes mentoi, kai\r\neuriskontai oruttomenoi]; and in his History of Animals he conjectures\r\nthat in ponds periodically dried the ova of the fish so buried become\r\nvivified at the change of the season.[1] HERODOTUS had previously\r\nhazarded a similar theory to account for the sudden appearance of fry in\r\nthe Egyptian marshes on the rising of the Nile; but the cases are not\r\nparallel. THEOPHRASTUS, the friend and pupil of Aristotle, gave\r\nimportance to the subject by devoting to it his essay [Greek: Peri tês\r\ntôn ichthyôn en zêrô diamonês], _De Piscibus in sicco degentibus_. In\r\nthis, after adverting to the fish called _exocoetus_, from its habit of\r\ngoing on shore to sleep, [Greek: apo tês koitês], he instances the small\r\nfish ([Greek: ichthydia]), which leave the rivers of India to wander\r\nlike frogs on the land; and likewise a species found near Babylon,\r\nwhich, when the Euphrates runs low, leave the dry channels in search of\r\nfood, \"moving themselves along by means of their fins and tail.\" He\r\nproceeds to state that at Heraclea Pontica there are places in which\r\nfish are dug out of the earth, ([Greek: oryktoi tôn ichthyôn]), and he\r\naccounts for their being found under such circumstances by the\r\nsubsidence of the rivers, \"when the water being evaporated the fish\r\ngradually descend beneath the soil in search of moisture; and the\r\nsurface becoming hard they are preserved in the damp clay below it, in a\r\nstate of torpor, but are capable of vigorous movements when disturbed.\r\nIn this manner, too,\" Theophrastus adds, \"the buried fish propagate,\r\nleaving behind them their spawn, which becomes vivified on the return of\r\nthe waters to their accustomed bed.\" This work of Theophrastus became\r\nthe great authority for all subsequent writers on this question.\r\nATHENÆUS quotes it[2], and adds the further testimony of POLYBIUS, that\r\nin Gallia Narbonensis fish are similarly dug out of the ground.[3]\r\nSTRABO repeats the story[4], and one and all the Greek naturalists\r\nreceived the statement as founded on reliable authority.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Lib. vi. ch, 15, 16, 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Lib. viii. ch. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Ib. ch. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Lib. iv. and xii.]\r\n\r\nNot so the Romans. LIVY mentions it as one of the prodigies which were\r\nto be \"expiated,\" on the approach of a rupture with Macedon, that \"in\r\nGallico agro qua induceretur aratrum sub glebis pisces emersisse,\"[1]\r\nthus taking it out of the category of natural occurrences. POMPONIUS\r\nMELA, obliged to notice the matter in his account of Narbon Gaul,\r\naccompanies it with the intimation that although asserted by both Greek\r\nand Roman authorities, the story was either a delusion or a fraud.[2]\r\nJUVENAL has a sneer for the rustic--\r\n\r\n          \"miranti sub aratro\r\n  Piscibus inventis.\"--_Sat_. xiii. 63.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Lib. xlii. ch. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Lib. ii ch, 5.]\r\n\r\nAnd SENECA, whilst he quotes Theophrastus, adds ironically, that now we\r\nmust go to fish with a _hatchet_ instead of a hook; \"non cum hamis, sed\r\ncum dolabra ire piscatum.\"[1] PLINY, who devotes the 35th chapter of his\r\n9th book to this subject, uses the narrative of Theophrastus, but with\r\nobvious caution, and universally the Latin writers treated the story as\r\na fable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Nat. Quæst._ vii 16.]\r\n\r\nIn later times the subject received more enlightened attention, and\r\nBeckmann, who in 1736 published his commentary on the collection [Greek:\r\nPeri Thaumasiôn akousmátôn], ascribed to Aristotle, has given a list of\r\nthe authorities about his own times,--Georgius Agricola, Gesner,\r\nRondelet, Dalechamp, Bomare, and Gronovius, who not only gave credence\r\nto the assertions of Theophrastus, but adduced modern instances in\r\ncorroboration of his Indian authorities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE (C.)\r\n\r\nCEYLON FISHES.\r\n\r\n(_Memorandum, by Professor Huxley._)\r\n\r\nSee p. 205.\r\n\r\nThe large series of beautifully coloured drawings of the fishes of\r\nCeylon, which has been submitted to my inspection, possesses an unusual\r\nvalue for several reasons.\r\n\r\nThe fishes, it appears, were all captured at Colombo, and even had those\r\nfrom other parts of Ceylon been added, the geographical area would not\r\nhave been very extended. Nevertheless there are more than 600 drawings,\r\nand though it is possible that some of these represent varieties in\r\ndifferent stages of growth of the same species, I have not been able to\r\nfind definite evidence of the fact in any of those groups which I have\r\nparticularly tested. If, however, these drawings represent _six hundred_\r\ndistinct species of fish, they constitute, so far as I know, the largest\r\ncollection of fish from one locality in existence.\r\n\r\nThe number of known British fishes may be safely assumed to be less than\r\n250, and Mr. Yarrell enumerates only 226, Dr. Cantor's valuable work on\r\nMalayan fishes enumerates not more than 238, while Dr. Russell has\r\nfigured only 200 from Coromandel. Even the enormous area of the Chinese\r\nand Japanese seas has as yet not yielded 800 species of fishes.\r\n\r\nThe large extent of the collection alone, then, renders it of great\r\nimportance; but its value is immeasurably enhanced by two\r\ncircumstances,--the _first_, that every drawing was made while the fish\r\nretained all that vividness of colouring which becomes lost so soon\r\nafter its removal from its native element; _second_, that when the\r\nsketch was finished its subject was carefully labelled, preserved in\r\nspirits, and forwarded to England, so that at the present moment the\r\noriginal of every drawing can be subjected to anatomical examination,\r\nand compared with already named species.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, I do not hesitate to say that the collection\r\nis one of the most valuable in existence, and might, if properly worked\r\nout, become a large and secure foundation for all future investigation\r\ninto the ichthyology of the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nIt would be very hazardous to express an opinion as to the novelty or\r\notherwise of the species and genera figured without the study of the\r\nspecimens themselves, as the specific distinctions of fish are for the\r\nmost part based upon character; the fin-rays, teeth, the operculum, &c.,\r\nwhich can only be made out by close and careful examination of the\r\nobject, and cannot be represented in ordinary drawings however accurate.\r\n\r\nThere are certain groups of fish, however, whose family traits are so\r\nmarked as to render it almost impossible to mistake even their\r\nportraits, and hence I may venture, without fear of being far wrong,\r\nupon a few remarks as to the general features of the ichthyological\r\nfauna of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nIn our own seas rather less than a tenth of the species of fishes belong\r\nto the cod tribe. I have not found one represented in these drawings,\r\nnor do either Russell or Cantor mention any in the surrounding seas, and\r\nthe result is in general harmony with the known laws of distribution of\r\nthese most useful of fishes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the mackerel family, including the tunnies, the\r\nbonitos, the dories, the horse-mackerels, &c., which form not more than\r\none sixteenth of our own fish fauna, but which are known to increase\r\ntheir proportion in hot climates, appear in wonderful variety of form\r\nand colour, and constitute not less than one fifth of the whole of the\r\nspecies of Ceylon fish. In Russell's catalogue they form less than one\r\nfifth, in Cantor's less than one sixth.\r\n\r\nMarine and other siluroid fishes, a group represented on the  continent\r\nof Europe, but doubtfully, if at all, in this country, constitute one\r\ntwentieth of the Ceylon fishes. In Russell's and Cantor's lists they\r\nform about one thirtieth of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe sharks and rays form about one seventh of our own fish fauna. They\r\nconstitute about one tenth or one eleventh of Russell and Cantor's\r\nlists, while among these Ceylon drawings I find not more than twenty, or\r\nabout one thirtieth of the whole, which can be referred to this group of\r\nfishes. It must be extremely interesting to know whether this\r\ncircumstance is owing to accident, or to the local peculiarities of\r\nColombo, or whether the fauna of Ceylon really is deficient in such\r\nfishes.\r\n\r\nThe like exceptional character is to be noticed in the proportion of the\r\ntribe of flat fishes, or _Pleuronectidæ_. Soles, turbots, and the like,\r\nform nearly one twelfth of our own fishes. Both Cantor and Russell give\r\nthe flat fishes as making one twenty-second part of their collection,\r\nwhile in the whole 600 Ceylon drawings I can find but five\r\n_Pleuronectidæ_.\r\n\r\nWhen this great collection has been carefully studied, I doubt not that\r\nmany more interesting distributional facts will be evolved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince receiving this note from Professor Huxley, the drawings in\r\nquestion have been submitted to Dr. Gray, of the British Museum, and\r\nthat eminent naturalist, after a careful analysis, has favoured me with\r\nthe following memorandum of the fishes they exhibit, numerically\r\ncontrasting them with those of China and Japan, so far as we are\r\nacquainted with the ichthyology of those seas:--\r\n\r\nCartilaginea.\r\n                                      China and\r\n                         Ceylon         Japan.\r\n\r\nSquali                     12            15\r\nRaiæ                       19            20\r\nSturiones                   0             1\r\n\r\nOstinopterygii.\r\n\r\nPlectognathi.\r\n  tetraodontidæ            10            21\r\n  balistidæ                 9            19\r\nLophobranchii\r\n  syngnathidæ               2             2\r\n  pegasidæ                  0             3\r\nCtenobranchii\r\n  lophidæ                   1             3\r\nCyclopodii.\r\n  echeneidæ                 0             1\r\n  cyclopteridæ              0             1\r\n  gobidæ                    7            35\r\n\r\n                                      China and\r\n                         Ceylon         Japan.\r\n\r\nPercini.\r\n  callionymidæ              0             7\r\n  uranoscopidæ              0             7\r\n  cottidæ                   0            13\r\n  triglidæ                 11            37\r\n  polynemidæ               12             3\r\n  mullidæ                   1             7\r\n  percidæ                  26            12\r\n  berycidæ                  0             5\r\n  sillaginidæ               3             1\r\n  sciænidæ                 19            13\r\n  hæmulinidæ                6            12\r\n  serranidæ                31            38\r\n  theraponidæ               8            20\r\n  cirrhitidæ                0             2\r\n  mænidiæ                  37            25\r\n  sparidæ                  16            17\r\n  acanthuridæ              14             6\r\n  chætodontidæ             25            21\r\n  fistularidæ               2             3\r\nPeriodopharyngi.\r\n  mugilidæ                  5             7\r\n  anabantidæ                6            15\r\n  pomacentridæ             10            11\r\nPharyngognathi.\r\n  labridæ                  16            35\r\n  scomberesocidæ           13             6\r\n  blenniidæ                 3             8\r\nScomberina.\r\n  zeidæ                     0             2\r\n  sphyrænidæ                5             4\r\n  scomberidæ              118            62\r\n  xiphiidæ                  0             1\r\n  cepolidæ                  0             5\r\nHeterosomata.\r\n  platessoideæ              5            22\r\n  siluridæ                 31            24\r\n  cyprinidæ                19            52\r\n  scopelinidæ               2             7\r\n  salmonidæ                 0             1\r\n  clupeidæ                 43            22\r\n  gadidæ                    0             2\r\n  macruridæ                 1             0\r\nApodes.\r\n  anguillidæ                8            12\r\n  murænidæ                  8             6\r\n  sphagebranchidæ           8            10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\nCONCHOLOGY, ETC.\r\n\r\nI. THE SHELLS OF CEYLON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made elsewhere to the profusion and variety of shells\r\nwhich abound in the seas and inland waters of Ceylon[1], and to the\r\nhabits of the Moormen, who monopolise the trade of collecting and\r\narranging them in satin-wood cabinets for transmission to Europe. But,\r\nalthough naturalists have long been familiar with the marine testacea of\r\nthis island, no successful attempt has yet been made to form a\r\nclassified catalogue of the species; and I am indebted to the eminent\r\nconchologist, Mr. Sylvanus Hanley, for the list which accompanies this\r\nnotice of those found in the island.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Vol. II. P. ix. ch. v.]\r\n\r\nIn drawing it up, Mr. Hanley observes that he found it a task of more\r\ndifficulty than would at first be surmised, owing to the almost total\r\nabsence of reliable data from which to construct it. Three sources were\r\navailable: collections formed by resident naturalists, the contents of\r\nthe well-known satin-wood boxes prepared at Trincomalie, and the\r\nlaborious elimination of locality from the habitats ascribed to all the\r\nknown species in the multitude of works on conchology in general.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, the first resource proved fallacious. There is no\r\nlarge collection in this country composed exclusively of Ceylon shells.\r\nAnd the very few cabinets rich in the marine treasures of the island\r\nhaving been filled as much by purchase as by personal exertion, there is\r\nan absence of the requisite confidence that all professing to be\r\nSinghalese have been actually captured in the island and its waters.\r\n\r\nThe cabinets arranged by the native dealers, though professing to\r\ncontain the productions of Ceylon, include shells which have been\r\nobtained from other islands in the Indian seas; and books, probably from\r\nthese very facts, are either obscure or deceptive. The old writers\r\ncontent themselves with assigning to any particular shell the\r\ntoo-comprehensive habitat of \"the Indian Ocean,\" and seldom discriminate\r\nbetween a specimen from Ceylon and one from the Eastern Archipelago or\r\nHindustan. In a very few instances, Ceylon has been indicated with\r\nprecision as the habitat of particular shells, but even here the views\r\nof specific essentials adopted by modern conchologists, and the\r\nsubdivisions established in consequence, leave us in doubt for which of\r\nthe described forms the collective locality should be retained.\r\n\r\nValuable notices of Ceylon shells are to be found in detached papers, in\r\nperiodicals, and in the scientific surveys of exploring voyages. The\r\nauthentic facts embodied in the monographs of Reeve, Kuster, Sowerby,\r\nand Kienn, have greatly enlarged the knowledge of the marine testacea;\r\nand the land and fresh-water mollusca have been similarly illustrated by\r\nthe contributions of Benson and Layard in the _Annals of Natural\r\nHistory_.\r\n\r\nThe dredge has been used but only in a few insulated spots along the\r\ncoasts of Ceylon; European explorers have been rare; and the natives,\r\nanxious only to secure the showy and saleable shells of the sea, have\r\nneglected the less attractive ones of the land and the lakes. Hence Mr.\r\nHanley finds it necessary to premise that the list appended, although\r\nthe result of infinite labour and research, is less satisfactory than\r\ncould have been wished. \"It is offered,\" he says, \"with diffidence, not\r\npretending to the merit of completeness as a shell-fauna of the island,\r\nbut rather as a form, which the zeal of other collectors may hereafter\r\nelaborate and fill up.\"\r\n\r\nLooking at the little that has yet been done, compared with the vast and\r\nalmost untried field which invites explorers, an assiduous collector may\r\nquadruple the species hitherto described. The minute shells especially\r\nmay be said to be unknown; a vigilant examination of the corals and\r\nexcrescences upon the spondyli and pearl-oysters would signally increase\r\nour knowledge of the Rissoæ, Chemnitziæ, and other perforating testacea,\r\nwhilst the dredge from the deep water will astonish the amateur by the\r\nwholly new forms it can scarcely fail to display.\r\n\r\nDr. Kelaart, an indefatigable observer, has recently undertaken to\r\ninvestigate the Nudibranchiata, Inferobranchiata, and Tectibranchiata;\r\nand a recently-received report from him, in the Journal of the Ceylon\r\nBranch of the Royal Asiatic Society, in which he has described fifty-six\r\nspecies,--thirty-three belonging to the genus Doris alone--gives ample\r\nevidence of what may be expected from the researches of a naturalist of\r\nhis acquirements and industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of Ceylon Shells._\r\n\r\nThe arrangement here adopted is a modified Lamarckian one, very similar\r\nto that used by Reeve and Sowerby, and by MR. HANLEY, in his\r\n_Illustrated Catalogue of Recent Shells_.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Below will be found a general reference to the Works or\r\nPapers in  which are given descriptive notices of the shells contained\r\nin the following list; the names of the authors (in full or abbreviated)\r\nbeing, as usual, annexed to each species.\r\n\r\nADAMS, _Proceed.

This fact gives to\r\nCeylon specimens an importance which can only be appreciated by\r\ncollectors and the students of Mollusca.\r\n\r\n2 RADIATA.\r\n\r\nThe eastern seas are profusely stocked with radiated animals, but it is\r\nto be regretted that they have as yet received but little attention from\r\nEnglish naturalists. Dr. Kelaart has, however, devoted himself to the\r\ninvestigation of some of the Singhalese species, and has given the\r\nfruits of his discoveries in the Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the\r\nAsiatic Society for 1856-8. Our information respecting the radiata on\r\nthe confines of the island is, therefore, very scanty; with the\r\nexception of the genera[1] examined by him. Hence the notice of this\r\nextensive class of animals must be limited to indicating a few of those\r\nwhich exhibit striking peculiarities, or which admit of the most common\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Actinia, 9 sp.: Anthea, 4 sp.; Actinodendron, 3 sp.;\r\nDioscosoma, 1 sp.; Peechea, 1 sp.; Zoanthura, 1 sp.]\r\n\r\n_Star Fish._--Very large species of _Ophiuridæ_ are to be met with at\r\nTrincomalie, crawling busily about, and insinuating their long\r\nserpentine arms into the irregularities and perforations in the rocks.\r\nTo these they attach themselves with such a firm grasp, especially when\r\nthey perceive that they have attracted attention, that it is next to\r\nimpossible to procure unmutilated specimens without previously depriving\r\nthem of life, or at least modifying their muscular tenacity. The upper\r\nsurface is of a dark purple colour, and coarsely spined; the arms of the\r\nlargest specimens are more than a foot in length, and very fragile.\r\n\r\nThe star fishes, with immovable rays[1], are not by any means rare; many\r\nkinds are brought up in the nets, or may be extracted from the stomachs\r\nof the larger market fish. One very large species[2], figured by\r\nJoinville in the manuscript volume in the library at the India House, is\r\nnot uncommon; it has thick arms, from which and the disc numerous large\r\nfleshy cirrhi of a bright crimson colour project downwards, giving the\r\ncreature a remarkable aspect. No description of it, so far as I am aware\r\nhas appeared in any systematic work on zoology.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Asterias_, Linn.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Pentaceros?_]\r\n\r\n_Sea Slugs._--There are a few species of _Holothuriæ_, of which the\r\ntrepang is the best known example. It is largely collected in the Gulf\r\nof Manaar, and dried in the sun to prepare it for export to China. A\r\ngood description and figure of it are still desiderata.\r\n\r\n_Parasitic Worms._--Of these entozoa, the _Filaria medinensis_, or\r\nguinea worm, which burrows in the cellular tissue under the skin, is\r\nwell known in the north of the island, but rarely found in the damper\r\ndistricts of the south and west. In Ceylon, as elsewhere, the natives\r\nattribute its occurrence to drinking the waters of particular wells; but\r\nthis belief is inconsistent with the fact that its lodgment in the human\r\nbody is almost always effected just above the ankle, which shows that\r\nthe minute parasites are transferred to the skin of the leg from the\r\nmoist vegetation bordering the footpaths leading to wells. The creatures\r\nare at this period minute, and the process of insinuation is painless\r\nand imperceptible. It is only when they attain to considerable size, a\r\nfoot or more in length, that the operation of extracting them is\r\nresorted to, when exercise may have given rise to inconvenience and\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\n_Planaria_.--In the journal above alluded to, Dr. Kelaart has given\r\ndescriptions of fifteen species of planaria, and four of a new genus,\r\ninstituted by him for the reception of those differing from the normal\r\nkinds by some peculiarities which they exhibit in common. At Point\r\nPedro, Mr. Edgar Layard met with one on the bark of trees, after heavy\r\nrain, which would appear to belong to the subgenus _geoplana_.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"A curious species, which is of a light brown above, white\r\nunderneath; very broad and thin, and has a peculiarly shaped tail,\r\nhalf-moon-shaped, in fact, like a grocer's cheese knife.\"]\r\n\r\n_Acalephæ_.--Acalephæ[1] are plentiful, so much so, indeed, that they\r\noccasionally tempt the larger cetacea into the Gulf of Manaar. In the\r\ncalmer months of the year, when the sea is glassy, and for hours\r\ntogether undisturbed by a ripple, the minute descriptions are rendered\r\nperceptible by their beautiful prismatic tinting. So great is their\r\ntransparency that they are only to be distinguished from the water by\r\nthe return of the reflected light that glances from their delicate and\r\npolished surfaces. Less frequently they are traced by the faint hues of\r\ntheir tiny peduncles, arms, or tentaculæ; and it has been well observed\r\nthat they often give the seas in which they abound the appearance of\r\nbeing crowded with flakes of half-melted snow. The larger kinds, when\r\nundisturbed in their native haunts, attain to considerable size. A\r\nfaintly blue medusa, nearly a foot across, may be seen in the Gulf of\r\nManaar, where, no doubt, others of still larger growth are to be found.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Jellyfish.]\r\n\r\nThe remaining orders, including the corals, madrepores, and other\r\npolypi, have yet to find a naturalist to undertake their investigation,\r\nbut in all probability the species are not very numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI\r\n\r\nINSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to the combination of heat, moisture, and vegetation, the myriads\r\nof insects in Ceylon form one of the characteristic features of the\r\nisland. In the solitude of the forests there is a perpetual music from\r\ntheir soothing and melodious hum, which frequently swells to a startling\r\nsound as the cicada trills his sonorous drum on the sunny bark of some\r\ntall tree. At morning the dew hangs in diamond drops on the threads and\r\ngossamer which the spiders suspend across every pathway; and above the\r\npool dragon flies, of more than metallic lustre, flash in the early\r\nsunbeams. The earth teems with countless ants, which emerge from beneath\r\nits surface, or make their devious highways to ascend to their nests in\r\nthe trees. Lustrous beetles, with their golden elytra, bask on the\r\nleaves, whilst minuter species dash through the air in circles, which\r\nthe ear can follow by the booming of their tiny wings. Butterflies of\r\nlarge size and gorgeous colouring flutter over the endless expanse of\r\nflowers, and frequently the extraordinary sight presents itself of\r\nflights of these delicate creatures, generally of a white or pale yellow\r\nhue, apparently miles in breadth, and of such prodigious extension as to\r\noccupy hours, and even days, uninterruptedly in their passage--whence\r\ncoming no one knows; wither going no one can tell.[1] As day declines,\r\nthe moths issue from their retreats, the crickets add their shrill\r\nvoices to swell the din; and when darkness descends, the eye is charmed\r\nwith the millions of emerald lamps lighted up by the fire-flies amidst\r\nthe surrounding gloom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The butterflies I have seen in these wonderful migrations\r\nin Ceylon were mostly _Callidryas Hilariæ, C. Alcmeone_, and _C.\r\nPyranthe_, with straggling individuals of the genus _Euploea, E. Coras_,\r\nand _E. Prothoe_. Their passage took place in April and May, generally\r\nin a north-easterly direction.]\r\n\r\nNo attempt has as yet been made to describe the class systematically,\r\nmuch less to enumerate the prodigious number of species which abound in\r\nevery locality. Occasional observers have, from time to time,\r\ncontributed notices of particular families to the Scientific\r\nAssociations of Europe, but their papers remain undigested, and the time\r\nhas not yet arrived for the preparation of an Entomology of the island.\r\n\r\nWhat Darwin remarks of the Coleoptera of Brazil is nearly as applicable\r\nto the same order of insects in Ceylon: \"The number of minute and\r\nobscurely coloured beetles is exceedingly great; the cabinets of Europe\r\ncan as yet, with partial exceptions, boast only of the larger species\r\nfrom tropical climates, and it is sufficient to disturb the composure of\r\nan entomologist to look forward to the future dimensions of a catalogue\r\nwith any pretensions to completeness.\"[l]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Nat. Journal_, p. 39.]\r\n\r\nM. Neitner, a German entomologist, who has spent some years in Ceylon,\r\nhas recently published, in one of the local periodicals, a series of\r\npapers on the Coleoptera of the island, in which every species\r\nintroduced is stated to be previously undescribed.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Republished in the _Ann. Nat. Hist_.]\r\n\r\nCOLEOPTERA.--_Buprestidoe; Golden Beetles_.--In the morning the\r\nherbaceous plants, especially on the eastern side of the island, are\r\nstudded with these gorgeous beetles whose golden elytra[1] are used to\r\nenrich the embroidery of the Indian zenana, whilst the lustrous joints\r\nof the legs are strung on silken threads, and form necklaces and\r\nbracelets of singular brilliancy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Sternocera Chrysis; S. sternicornis_.]\r\n\r\nThese exquisite colours are not confined to one order, and some of the\r\nElateridæ[1] and Lamellicorns exhibit hues of green and blue, that rival\r\nthe deepest tints of the emerald and sapphire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Of the family of _Elateridæ_, one of the finest is a\r\nSinghalese species, the _Compsosternus Templetonii_, of an exquisite\r\ngolden green colour, with blue reflections (described and figured by Mr.\r\nWESTWOOD in his _Cabinet of Oriental Entomology_, pl. 35, f. 1). In the\r\nsame work is figured another species of large size, also from Ceylon,\r\nthis is the _Alaus sordidus_.--WESTWOOD, 1. c. pl. 35, f. 9.]\r\n\r\n_Scavenger Beetles_.--Scavenger beetles[1] are to be seen wherever the\r\npresence of putrescent and offensive matter affords opportunity for the\r\ndisplay of their repulsive but most curious instincts; fastening on it\r\nwith eagerness, severing it into lumps proportionate to their strength,\r\nand rolling it along in search of some place sufficiently soft in which\r\nto bury it, after having deposited their eggs in the centre. I had\r\nfrequent opportunities, especially in traversing the sandy jungles in\r\nthe level plains to the north of the island, of observing the unfailing\r\nappearance of these creatures instantly on the dropping of horse dung,\r\nor any other substance suitable for their purpose; although not one was\r\nvisible but a moment before. Their approach through the air is announced\r\nby a loud and joyous booming sound, as they dash in rapid circles in\r\nsearch of the desired object, led by their sense of smell, but evidently\r\nlittle assisted by the eye in shaping their course towards it. In these\r\nexcursions they exhibit a strength of wing and sustained power of\r\nflight, such as is possessed by no other class of beetles with which I\r\nam acquainted, but which is obviously indispensable for the due\r\nperformance of the useful functions they discharge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ateuchus sacer; Copris sagax; C. capucinus_, &c. &c.]\r\n\r\n_The Coco-nut Beetle._--In the luxuriant forests of Ceylon, the\r\nextensive family of Longicorns live in destructive abundance. Their\r\nravages are painfully familiar to the coco-nut planters.[1] The larva of\r\none species of large dimensions, _Batocera rubus_[2], called by the\r\nSinghalese \"_Cooroominya_\" makes its way into the stems of the younger\r\ntrees, and after perforating them in all directions, it forms a cocoon\r\nof the gnawed wood and sawdust, in which it reposes during its sleep as\r\na pupa, till the arrival of the period when it emerges as a perfect\r\nbeetle. Notwithstanding the repulsive aspect of the large pulpy larvæ of\r\nthese beetles, they are esteemed a luxury by the Malabar coolies, who so\r\nfar avail themselves of the privilege accorded by the Levitical law,\r\nwhich permitted the Hebrews to eat \"the beetle after his kind.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There is a paper in the _Journ. of the Asiat. Society of\r\nCeylon_, May, 1845, by Mr. CAPPER, on the ravages perpetrated by these\r\nbeetles. The writer had recently passed through several coco-nut\r\nplantations, \"varying in extent from 20 to 150 acres, and about two to\r\nthree years old; and in these he did not discover a single young tree\r\nuntouched by the cooroominya.\"--P. 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Called also B. _octo-maculatus; Lamia rubus_, Fabr.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Leviticus, xi. 22.]\r\n\r\n_Tortoise Beetles_.--There is one family of insects, the members of\r\nwhich cannot fail to strike the traveller by their singular beauty, the\r\n_Cassidiadæ_ or tortoise beetles, in which the outer shell overlaps the\r\nbody, and the limbs are susceptible of being drawn entirely within it.\r\nThe rim is frequently of a different tint from the centre, and one\r\nspecies which I have seen is quite startling from the brilliancy of its\r\ncolouring, which gives it the appearance of a ruby enclosed in a frame\r\nof pearl; but this wonderful effect disappears immediately on the death\r\nof the insect.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: One species, the _Cassida farinosa_, frequent in the jungle\r\nwhich surrounded my official residence at Kandy, is covered profusely\r\nwith a snow-white powder, arranged in delicate filaments, which it moves\r\nwithout dispersing: but when dead they fall rapidly to dust.]\r\n\r\nORTHOPTERA. _The Soothsayer_.--But the admiration of colours is still\r\nless exciting than the astonishment created by the forms in which some\r\nof the insect families present themselves, especially the \"soothsayers\"\r\n(_Mantidæ_) and \"walking leaves.\" The latter[1], exhibiting the most\r\ncunning of all nature's devices for the preservation of her creatures,\r\nare found in the jungle in all varieties of hue, from the pale yellow of\r\nan opening bud to the rich green of the full-blown leaf, and the\r\nwithered tint of decaying foliage. And so perfect is the imitation in\r\nstructure and articulation, that these amazing insects when at rest are\r\nalmost indistinguishable from the verdure around them: not the wings\r\nalone being modelled to resemble ribbed and fibrous follicles, but every\r\njoint of the legs being expanded into a broad plait like a half-opened\r\nleaflet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Phyllium siccifolium._]\r\n\r\nIt rests on its abdomen, the legs serving to drag it slowly along, and\r\nthus the flatness of its attitude serves still further to add to the\r\nappearance of a leaf. One of the most marvellous incidents connected\r\nwith its organisation was exhibited by one which I kept under a glass\r\nshade on my table; it laid a quantity of eggs, that, in colour and\r\nshape, were not to be discerned from _seeds_. They were brown and\r\npentangular, with a short stem, and slightly punctured at the\r\nintersections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EGGS OF THE LEAF INSECT.]\r\n\r\nThe \"soothsayer,\" on the other hand _(Mantis superstitiosa_ Fab.[1]),\r\nlittle justifies by its propensities the appearance of gentleness, and\r\nthe attitudes of sanctity, which have obtained for it its title of the\r\npraying mantis. Its habits are carnivorous, and degenerate into\r\ncannibalism, as it preys on the weaker individuals of its own species.\r\nTwo which I enclosed in a box were both found dead a few hours after,\r\nliterally severed limb from limb in their encounter. The formation of\r\nthe foreleg enables the tibia to be so closed on the sharp edge of the\r\nthigh as to amputate any slender substance grasped within it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _M. aridifolia_ and _M. extensicollis_, as well as _Empusa\r\ngongyloides_, remarkable for the long leaf-like head, and dilatations on\r\nthe posterior thighs, are common in the island.]\r\n\r\n_The Stick-insect_--The _Phasmidoe_ or spectres, another class of\r\northoptera, present as close a resemblance to small branches or leafless\r\ntwigs as their congeners do to green leaves. The wing-covers, where they\r\nexist, instead of being expanded, are applied so closely to the body as\r\nto detract nothing from its rounded form, and hence the name which they\r\nhave acquired of \"_walking-sticks_.\" Like the _Phyllium_, the _Phasma_\r\nlives exclusively on vegetables, and some attain the length of several\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nOf all the other tribes of the _Orthoptera_ Ceylon possesses many\r\nrepresentatives; in swarms of cockroaches, grasshoppers, locusts, and\r\ncrickets.\r\n\r\nNEUROPTERA. _Dragon-flies._--Of the _Neuroptera_, some of the\r\ndragon-flies are pre-eminently beautiful; one species, with rich\r\nbrown-coloured spots upon its gauzy wings, is to be seen near every\r\npool.[1] Another[2], which dances above the mountain streams in Oovah,\r\nand amongst the hills descending towards Kandy, gleams in the sun as if\r\neach of its green enamelled wings had been sliced from an emerald.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Libellula pulchella._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Euphoea splendens_, Hagen.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Gymnacantha subinterrupta_, Ramb. distinguished by its\r\nlarge size, is plentiful about the mountain streamlets.]\r\n\r\n_The Ant-lion_.--Of the ant-lion, whose larvæ have earned a bad renown\r\nfrom their predaceous ingenuity, Ceylon has, at least, four species,\r\nwhich seem peculiar to the island.[1] This singular creature,\r\npreparatory to its pupal transformation, contrives to excavate a conical\r\npitfall in the dust to the depth of about an inch, in the bottom of\r\nwhich it conceals itself, exposing only its open mandibles above the\r\nsurface; and here every ant and soft-bodied insect which, curiosity\r\ntempts to descend, or accident may precipitate into the trap, is\r\nruthlessly seized and devoured by its ambushed inhabitant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Palpares contrarius_, Walker; _Myrmeleon gravis_, Walker;\r\n_M. dirus_, Walker; _M. barbarus_, Walker.]\r\n\r\n_The White Ant_--But of the insects of this order the most noted are the\r\n_white ants_ or termites (which are ants only by a misnomer). They are,\r\nunfortunately, at once ubiquitous and innumerable in every spot where\r\nthe climate is not too chilly, or the soil too sandy, for them to\r\nconstruct their domed edifices.\r\n\r\nThese they raise from a considerable depth under ground, excavating the\r\nclay with their mandibles, and moistening it with tenacious saliva[1]\r\nuntil it assume the appearance, and almost the consistency, of\r\nsandstone. So delicate is the trituration to which they subject this\r\nmaterial, that the goldsmiths of Ceylon employ the powdered clay of the\r\nant hills in preference to all other substances in the preparation of\r\ncrucibles and moulds for their finer castings; and KNOX says, in his\r\ntime, \"the people used this clay to make their earthen gods of, it is so\r\npure and fine.\"[2] These structures the termites erect with such\r\nperseverance and durability that they frequently rise to the height of\r\nten or twelve feet from the ground, with a corresponding diameter. They\r\nare so firm in their texture that the weight of a horse makes no\r\napparent indentation on their solidity; and even the intense rains of\r\nthe monsoon, which no cement or mortar can long resist, fail to\r\npenetrate the surface or substance of an ant hill.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It becomes an interesting question whence the termites\r\nderive the large supplies of moisture with which they not only temper\r\nthe clay for the construction of their long covered-ways above ground,\r\nbut for keeping their passages uniformly damp and cool below the\r\nsurface. Yet their habits in this particular are unvarying, in the\r\nseasons of droughts as well as after rain; in the driest and least\r\npromising positions, in situations inaccessible to drainage from above,\r\nand cut off by rocks and impervious strata from springs from below. Dr.\r\nLivingstone, struck with this phenomenon in Southern Africa, asks: \"Can\r\nthe white ants possess the power of combining the oxygen and hydrogen of\r\ntheir vegetable food by vital force so as to form water?\"--_Travels_, p.\r\n22. And he describes at Angola an insect (A. goudotti? Bennett.)\r\nresembling the _Aphrophora spumaria_; seven or eight individuals of\r\nwhich distil several pints of water every night.--P. 414. It is highly\r\nprobable that the termites are endowed with some such faculty: nor is it\r\nmore remarkable that an insect should combine the gases of its food to\r\nproduce water, than that a fish should decompose water in order to\r\nprovide itself with gas. FOURCROIX found the contents of the air-bladder\r\nin a carp to be pure nitrogen.--_Yarrell_, vol. i. p. 42. And the\r\naquatic larva of the dragon-fly extracts air for its respiration from\r\nthe water in which it is submerged. A similar mystery pervades the\r\ninquiry whence plants under peculiar circumstances derive the water\r\nessential to vegetation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: KNOX'S _Ceylon_, Part I, ch. vi. p. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Dr. HOOKER, in his _Himalayan Journal_ (vol. i. p. 20) is\r\nof opinion that the nests of the termites are not independent\r\nstructures, but that their nucleus is \"the debris of clumps of bamboos\r\nor the trunks of large trees which these insects have destroyed.\" He\r\nsupposes that the dead tree falls leaving the stump coated with sand,\r\n_which the action of the weather soon fashions info a cone_. But\r\nindependently of the fact that the \"action of the weather\" produces\r\nlittle or no effect on the closely cemented clay of the white ants'\r\nnest, they may be daily seen constructing their edifices in the very\r\nform of a cone, which they ever after retain. Besides which, they appear\r\nin the midst of terraces and fields where no trees are to be seen; and\r\nDr. Hooker seems to overlook the fact that the termites rarely attack a\r\nliving tree; and although their nests may be built against one, it\r\ncontinues to flourish not the less for their presence.]\r\n\r\nIn their earlier stages the termites proceed with such energetic\r\nrapidity, that I have seen a pinnacle of moist clay, six inches in\r\nheight and twice as large in diameter, constructed underneath a table\r\nbetween sitting down to dinner and the removal of the cloth.\r\n\r\nAs these lofty mounds of earth have all been carried up from beneath the\r\nsurface, a cave of corresponding dimensions is necessarily scooped out\r\nbelow, and here, under the multitude of cupolas and pinnacles which\r\ncanopy it above, the termites hollow out the royal chamber for their\r\nqueen, with spacious nurseries surrounding it on all sides. Store-rooms\r\nand magazines occupy the lower apartments, and all are connected by\r\narched galleries, long passages, and doorways of the most intricate and\r\nelaborate construction. In the centre and underneath the spacious dome\r\nis the recess for the queen--a hideous creature, with the head and\r\nthorax of an ordinary termite, but a body swollen to a hundred times its\r\nusual and proportionate bulk, and presenting the appearance of a mass of\r\nshapeless pulp. From this great progenitrix proceed the myriads which\r\npeople the subterranean hive, consisting, like the communities of the\r\ngenuine ants, of labourers and soldiers, which are destined never to\r\nacquire a fuller development than that of larvas, and the perfect\r\ninsects which in due time become invested with wings and take their\r\ndeparting flight from the cave. But their new equipment seems only\r\ndestined to facilitate their dispersion from the parent nest, which\r\ntakes place at dusk; and almost as quickly as they leave it they divest\r\nthemselves of their ineffectual wings, waving them impatiently and\r\ntwisting them in every direction till they become detached and drop off,\r\nand the swarm, within a few hours of their emancipation, become a prey\r\nto the night-jars and bats, which are instantly attracted to them as\r\nthey issue in a cloud from the ground. I am not prepared to say that the\r\nother insectivorous birds would not gladly make a meal of the termites,\r\nbut, seeing that in Ceylon their numbers are chiefly kept in check by\r\nthe crepuscular birds, it is observable, at least as a coincidence, that\r\nthe dispersion of the swarm generally takes place at _twilight_. Those\r\nthat escape the _caprimulgi_ lose their wings before morning, and are\r\nthen disposed of by the crows.\r\n\r\nThe strange peculiarity of the omnivorous ravages of the white ants is\r\nthat they shrink from the light, in all their expeditions for providing\r\nfood they construct a covered pathway of moistened clay, and their\r\ngalleries above ground extend to an incredible distance from the central\r\nnest. No timber, except ebony and ironwood, which are too hard, and\r\nthose which are strongly impregnated with camphor or aromatic oils,\r\nwhich they dislike, presents any obstacle to their ingress. I have had a\r\ncase of wine filled, in the course of two days, with almost solid clay,\r\nand only discovered the presence of the white ants by the bursting of\r\nthe corks. I have had a portmanteau in my tent so peopled with them in\r\nthe course of a single night that the contents were found worthless in\r\nthe morning. In an incredibly short time a detachment of these pests\r\nwill destroy a press full of records, reducing the paper to fragments;\r\nand a shelf of books will be tunnelled into a gallery if it happen to be\r\nin their line of march.\r\n\r\nThe timbers of a house when fairly attacked are eaten from within till\r\nthe beams are reduced to an absolute shell, so thin that it may be\r\npunched through with the point of the finger: and even kyanized wood,\r\nunless impregnated with an extra quantity of corrosive sublimate,\r\nappears to occasion them no inconvenience. The only effectual precaution\r\nfor the protection of furniture is incessant vigilance--the constant\r\nwatching of every article, and its daily removal from place to place, in\r\norder to baffle their assaults.\r\n\r\nThey do not appear in the hills above the elevation of 2000 feet. One\r\nspecies of white ant, the _Termes Taprobanes_, was at one time believed\r\nby Mr. Walker to be peculiar to the island, but it has recently been\r\nfound in Sumatra and Borneo, and in some parts of Hindustan.\r\n\r\nHYMENOPTERA. _Mason Wasp_.--In Ceylon as in all other countries, the\r\norder of hymenopterous insects arrests us less by the beauty of their\r\nforms than the marvels of their sagacity and the achievements of their\r\ninstinct. A fossorial wasp of the family of _Sphegidoe_,[1] which is\r\ndistinguished by its metallic lustre, enters by the open windows, and\r\ndisarms irritation at its movements by admiration of the graceful\r\nindustry with which it stops up the keyholes and similar apertures with\r\nclay in order to build in them a cell, into which it thrusts the pupa of\r\nsome other insect, within whose body it has previously introduced its\r\nown eggs; and, enclosing the whole with moistened earth, the young\r\nparasite, after undergoing its transformations, gnaws its way into\r\nlight, and emerges a four-winged fly.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It belongs to the genus _Pelopoeus_, _P. Spinoloe_, St.\r\nFargeau. The _Ampulex compressa_, which drags about the larvæ of\r\ncockroaches into which it has implanted its eggs, belongs to the same\r\nfamily.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Mr. E. L. Layard has given an interesting account of this\r\nMason wasp in the _Annals and Magazine of Nat. History_ for May, 1853.\r\n\r\n\"I have frequently,\" he says, \"selected one of these flies for\r\nobservation, and have seen their labours extend over a period of a\r\nfortnight or twenty days; sometimes only half a cell was completed in a\r\nday, at others as much as two. I never saw more than twenty cells in one\r\nnest, seldom indeed that number, and whence the caterpillars were\r\nprocured was always to me a mystery. I have seen thirty or forty brought\r\nin of a species which I knew to be very rare in the perfect state, and\r\nwhich I had sought for in vain, although I knew on what plant they fed.\r\n\r\n\"Then again how are they disabled by the wasp, and yet not injured so as\r\nto cause their immediate death? Die they all do, at least all that I\r\nhave ever tried to rear, after taking them from the nest.\r\n\r\n\"The perfected fly never effects its egress from the closed aperture,\r\nthrough which the caterpillars were inserted, and when cells are placed\r\nend to end, as they are in many instances, the outward end of each is\r\nalways selected. I cannot detect any difference in the thickness in the\r\ncrust of the cell to cause this uniformity of practice. It is often as\r\nmuch as half an inch through, of great hardness, and as far as I can see\r\nimpervious to air and light. How then does the enclosed fly always\r\nselect the right end, and with what secretion is it supplied to\r\ndecompose this mortar?\"]\r\n\r\n_Wasps_.--Of the wasps, one formidable species (_Sphex ferruginea_ of\r\nSt. Fargeau), which is common to India and most of the eastern islands,\r\nis regarded with the utmost dread by the unclad natives, who fly\r\nprecipitately on finding themselves in the vicinity[1] of its nests,\r\nwhich are of such ample dimensions, that when suspended from a branch,\r\nthey often measure upwards of six feet in length.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In ought to be remembered in travelling in the forests of\r\nCeylon that sal volatile applied immediately is a specific for the sting\r\nof a wasp.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: At the January (1839) meeting of the Entomological Society,\r\nMr. Whitehouse exhibited portions of a wasps' nest from Ceylon, between\r\nseven and eight feet long and two feet in diameter, and showed that the\r\nconstruction of the cells was perfectly analogous to those of the hive\r\nbee, and that when connected each has a tendency to assume a circular\r\noutline. In one specimen where there were three cells united the outer\r\npart was circular, whilst the portions common to the three formed\r\nstraight walls. From this Singhalese nest Mr. Whitehouse demonstrated\r\nthat the wasps at the commencement of their comb proceed slowly, forming\r\nthe bases of several together, whereby they assume the hexagonal shape,\r\nwhereas, if constructed separately, he thought each single cell would be\r\ncircular. See _Proc. Ent. Soc_. vol. iii. p. xvi.]\r\n\r\n_Bees_.--Bees of several species and genera, some divested of stings,\r\nand some in size scarcely exceeding a house-fly, deposit their honey in\r\nhollow trees, or suspend their combs from a branch; and the spoils of\r\ntheir industry form one of the chief resources of the uncivilised\r\nVeddahs, who collect the wax in their upland forests, to be bartered for\r\narrow points and clothes in the lowlands.[1] I have never heard of an\r\ninstance of persons being attacked by the bees of Ceylon, and hence the\r\nnatives assert, that those most productive of honey are destitute of\r\nstings.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A gentleman connected with the department of the\r\nSurveyor-General writes to me that he measured a honey-comb which he\r\nfound fastened to the overhanging branch of a small tree in the forest\r\nnear Adam's Peak, and found it nine links of his chain or about six feet\r\nin length and a foot in breadth where it was attached to the branch, but\r\ntapering towards the other extremity. \"It was a single comb with a layer\r\nof cells on either side, but so weighty that the branch broke by the\r\nstrain.\"]\r\n\r\n_The Carpenter Bee_.--The operations of one of the most interesting of\r\nthe tribe, the Carpenter bee,[1] I have watched with admiration from the\r\nwindow of the Colonial Secretary's official residence at Kandy. So soon\r\nas the day grew warm, these active creatures were at work perforating\r\nthe wooden columns which supported the verandah. They poised themselves\r\non their shining purple wings, as they made the first lodgment in the\r\nwood, enlivening the work with an uninterrupted hum of delight, which\r\nwas audible to a considerable distance. When the excavation had\r\nproceeded so far as that the insect could descend into it, the music was\r\nsuspended, but renewed from time to time, as the little creature came to\r\nthe orifice to throw out the chips, to rest, or to enjoy the fresh air.\r\nBy degrees, a mound of saw-dust was formed at the base of the pillar,\r\nconsisting of particles abraded by the mandibles of the bee; and these,\r\nwhen the hollow was completed to the depth of several inches, were\r\npartially replaced in the excavation after being agglutinated to form\r\npartitions between the eggs, as they are deposited within.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Xylocopa tenuiscapa_, Westw.; X. _latipes_, Drury.]\r\n\r\n_Ants_.--As to ants, I apprehend that, notwithstanding their numbers and\r\nfamiliarity, information is very imperfect relative to the varieties and\r\nhabits of these marvellous insects in Ceylon.[1] In point of multitude\r\nit is scarcely an exaggeration to apply to them the figure of \"the sands\r\nof the sea.\" They are everywhere; in the earth, in the houses, and in\r\nthe trees; they are to be seen in every room and cupboard, and almost on\r\nevery plant in the jungle. To some of the latter they are, perhaps,\r\nattracted by the sweet juices secreted by the aphides and coccidæ; and\r\nsuch is the passion of the ants for sugar, and their wonderful faculty\r\nof discovering it, that the smallest particle of a substance containing\r\nit, though placed in the least conspicuous position, is quickly covered\r\nwith them, where not a single one may have been visible a moment before.\r\nBut it is not sweet substances alone that they attack; no animal or\r\nvegetable matter comes amiss to them; no aperture appears too small to\r\nadmit them; it is necessary to place everything which it may be\r\ndesirable to keep free from their invasion, under the closest cover, or\r\non tables with cups of water under every foot. As scavengers, they are\r\ninvaluable; and as ants never sleep, but work without cessation, during\r\nthe night as well as by day, every particle of decaying vegetable or\r\nputrid animal matter is removed with inconceivable speed and certainty.\r\nIn collecting shells, I have been able to turn this propensity to good\r\naccount; by placing them within their reach, the ants in a few days will\r\nremove every vestige of the mollusc from the innermost and otherwise\r\ninaccessible whorls; thus avoiding all risk of injuring the enamel by\r\nany mechanical process.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Jerdan, in a series of papers in the thirteenth volume\r\nof the _Annals of Natural History_, has described forty-seven species of\r\nants in Southern India. But M. Nietner has recently forwarded to the\r\nBerlin Museum upwards of seventy species taken by him in Ceylon, chiefly\r\nin the western province and the vicinity of Colombo, Of these many are\r\nidentical with those noted by Mr. Jerdan as belonging to the Indian\r\ncontinent. One (probably _Drepanognathus saltator_ of Jerdan) is\r\ndescribed by M. Nietner as \"moving by jumps of several inches at a\r\nspring.\"]\r\n\r\nBut the assaults of the ants are not confined to dead animals alone,\r\nthey attack equally such small insects as they can overcome, or find\r\ndisabled by accidents or wounds; and it is not unusual to see some\r\nhundreds of them surrounding a maimed beetle, or a bruised cockroach,\r\nand hurrying it along in spite of its struggles. I have, on more than\r\none occasion, seen a contest between them and one of the viscous\r\nophidians, _Coecilia glutinosa_[1], a reptile resembling an enormous\r\nearthworm, common in the Kandyan hills, of an inch in diameter, and\r\nnearly two feet in length. It would seem as if the whole community had\r\nbeen summoned and turned out for such a prodigious effort; they\r\nsurrounded their victim literally in tens of thousands, inflicting\r\nwounds on all parts, and forcing it along towards their nest in spite of\r\nresistance. In one instance to which I was a witness, the conflict\r\nlasted for the latter part of a day, but towards evening the Cæcilia was\r\ncompletely exhausted, and in the morning it had totally disappeared,\r\nhaving been carried away either whole or piecemeal by its assailants.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See ante, Pt, 1. ch. iii. p. 201]\r\n\r\nThe species I here allude to, is a very small ant, called the _Koombiya_\r\nin Ceylon. There is a still more minute description, which frequents the\r\ncaraffes and toilet vessels, and is evidently a distinct species. A\r\nthird, probably the _Formica nidificans_ of Jerdan, is black, of the\r\nsame size as that last mentioned, and, from its colour, called the _Kalu\r\nkoombiya_ by the natives. In the houses its propensities and habits are\r\nthe same as the others; but I have observed that it frequents the trees\r\nmore profusely, forming small paper cells for its young, like miniature\r\nwasps' nests, in which it deposits its eggs, suspending them from the\r\nleaf of a plant.\r\n\r\nThe most formidable of all is the great red ant or Dimiya.[1] It is\r\nparticularly abundant in gardens, and on fruit trees; it constructs its\r\ndwellings by glueing the leaves of such species as are suitable from\r\ntheir shape and pliancy into hollow balls, which it lines with a kind of\r\ntransparent paper, like that manufactured by the wasp. I have watched\r\nthem at the interesting operation of forming their dwellings;--a line of\r\nants standing on the edge of one leaf bring another into contact with\r\nit, and hold both together with their mandibles till their companions\r\nwithin attach them firmly by means of their adhesive paper, the\r\nassistants outside moving along as the work proceeds. If it be necessary\r\nto draw closer a leaf too distant to be laid hold of by the immediate\r\nworkers, they form a chain by depending one from the other till the\r\nobject is reached, when it is at length brought into contact, and made\r\nfast by cement.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Formica smaragdina_, Fab.]\r\n\r\nLike all their race, these ants are in perpetual motion, forming lines\r\non the ground along which they pass, in continual procession to and from\r\nthe trees on which they reside. They are the most irritable of the whole\r\norder in Ceylon, biting with such intense ferocity as to render it\r\ndifficult for the unclad natives to collect the fruit from, the mango\r\ntrees, which the red ants especially frequent. They drop from the\r\nbranches upon travellers in the jungle, attacking them with venom and\r\nfury, and inflicting intolerable pain both upon animals and man. On\r\nexamining the structure of the head through a microscope, I found that\r\nthe mandibles, instead of merely meeting in contact, are so hooked as to\r\ncross each other at the points, whilst the inner line is sharply\r\nserrated throughout its entire length; thus occasioning the intense pain\r\nof their bite, as compared with that of the ordinary ant.\r\n\r\nTo check the ravages of the coffee bug (_Lecanium coffeoe_, Walker),\r\nwhich for some years past has devastated some of the plantations in\r\nCeylon, the experiment was made of introducing the red ants, who feed\r\ngreedily on the Coccus. But the remedy threatened to be attended with\r\nsome inconvenience, for the Malabar Coolies, with bare and oiled skins,\r\nwere so frequently and fiercely assaulted by the ants as to endanger\r\ntheir stay on the estates.\r\n\r\nThe ants which burrow in the ground in Ceylon are generally, but not\r\ninvariably, black, and some of them are of considerable size. One\r\nspecies, about the third of an inch in length, is abundant in the hills,\r\nand especially about the roots of trees, where they pile up the earth in\r\ncircular heaps round the entrance to their nests, and in doing this I\r\nhave observed a singular illustration of their instinct. To carry up\r\neach particle of sand by itself would be an endless waste of labour, and\r\nto carry two or more loose ones securely would be to them embarrassing,\r\nif not impossible; they therefore overcome the difficulty by glueing\r\ntogether with their saliva so much earth or sand as is sufficient for a\r\nburden, and each one may be seen hurrying up from below with his load,\r\ncarrying it to the top of the circular heap outside, and throwing it\r\nover, whilst it is so strongly attached as to roll to the bottom without\r\nbreaking asunder.\r\n\r\nThe ants I have been here describing are inoffensive, differing in this\r\nparticular from the Dimiya and another of similar size and ferocity,\r\nwhich is called by the Singhalese _Kaddiya_; and they have a legend\r\nillustrative of their alarm for the bites of the latter, to the effect\r\nthat the cobra de capello invested the Kaddiya with her own venom in\r\nadmiration of the singular courage displayed by these little\r\ncreatures.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: KNOX'S _Historical Relation of Ceylon_, pt i. ch vi. p.\r\n23.]\r\n\r\nLEPIDOPTERA. _Butterflies_.--Butterflies in the interior of the island\r\nare comparatively rare, and, contrary to the ordinary belief, they are\r\nseldom to be seen in the sunshine, They frequent the neighbourhood of\r\nthe jungle, and especially the vicinity of the rivers and waterfalls,\r\nliving mainly in the shade of the moist foliage, and returning to it in\r\nhaste after the shortest flights, as if their slender bodies were\r\nspeedily dried up and exhausted by the exposure to the intense heat.\r\n\r\nAmong the largest and most gaudy of the Ceylon Lepidoptera is the great\r\nblack and yellow butterfly (_Ornithoptera darsius_, Gray); the upper\r\nwings, of which measure six inches across, are of deep velvet black, the\r\nlower, ornamented by large particles of satiny yellow, through which the\r\nsunlight passes, and few insects can compare with it in beauty, as it\r\nhovers over the flowers of the heliotrope, which furnish the favourite\r\nfood of the perfect fly, although the caterpillar feeds on the\r\naristolochia and the _betel leaf_ and suspends its chrysalis from its\r\ndrooping tendrils.\r\n\r\nNext in size as to expanse of wing, though often exceeding it in\r\nbreadth, is the black and blue _Papilio Polymnestor_, which darts\r\nrapidly through the air, alighting on the ruddy flowers of the hibiscus,\r\nor the dark green foliage of the citrus, on which it deposits its eggs.\r\nThe larvæ of this species are green with white bands, and have a hump on\r\nthe fourth or fifth segment. From this hump the caterpillar, on being\r\nirritated, protrudes a singular horn of an orange colour, bifurcate at\r\nthe extremity, and covered with a pungent mucilaginous secretion. This\r\nis evidently intended as a weapon of defence against the attack of the\r\nichneumon flies, that deposit their eggs in its soft body, for when the\r\ngrub is pricked, either by the ovipositor of the ichneumon, or by any\r\nother sharp instrument, the horn is at once protruded, and struck upon\r\nthe offending object with unerring aim.\r\n\r\nAmongst the more common of the larger butterflies is the _P. Hector_,\r\nwith gorgeous crimson spots set in the black velvet of the inferior\r\nwings; these, when fresh, are shot with a purple blush, equalling in\r\nsplendour the azure of the European \"_Emperor_.\"\r\n\r\nAnother butterfly, but belonging to a widely different group, is the\r\n\"sylph\" (_Hestia Jasonia_), called by the Europeans by the various names\r\nof _Floater, Spectre,_ and _Silver-paper-fly_, as indicative of its\r\ngraceful flight. It is found only in the deep shade of the damp forest,\r\nfrequenting the vicinity of pools of water and cascades, about which it\r\nsails heedless of the spray, the moisture of which may even be\r\nbeneficial in preserving the elasticity of its thin and delicate wings,\r\nthat bend and undulate in the act of flight.\r\n\r\nThe _Lycoenidoe_[1], a particularly attractive group, abound near the\r\nenclosures of cultivated grounds, and amongst the low shrubs edging the\r\npatenas, flitting from flower to flower, inspecting each in turn, and as\r\nif attracted by their beauty, in the full blaze of sun-light; and\r\nshunning exposure less sedulously than the other diurnals. Some of the\r\nmore robust kinds[2] are magnificent in the bright light, from the\r\nsplendour of their metallic blues and glowing purples, but they yield in\r\nelegance of form and variety to their tinier and more\r\ndelicately-coloured congeners.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Lycana polyommatus, &c._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Amblypodia pseudocentaurus, &c._]\r\n\r\nShort as is the eastern twilight, it has its own peculiar forms, and the\r\nnaturalist marks with interest the small, but strong, _Hesperiidoe_,[1]\r\nhurrying, by abrupt and jerking flights, to the scented blossoms of the\r\nchampac or the sweet night-blowing moon-flower; and, when darkness\r\ngathers around, we can hear, though hardly distinguish amid the gloom,\r\nthe humming of the powerful wings of innumerable hawk moths, which hover\r\nwith their long proboscides inserted into the starry petals of the\r\nperiwinkle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Pamphila hesperia, &c._]\r\n\r\nConspicuous amidst these nocturnal moths is the richly-coloured\r\n_Acherontia Satanas_, one of the Singhalese representatives of our\r\nDeath's head moth, which utters a sharp and stridulous cry when seized.\r\nThis sound has been variously conjectured to be produced by the friction\r\nof its thorax against the abdomen, and Reaumur believed it to be caused\r\nby rubbing the palpi against the tongue. I have never been able to\r\nobserve either motion, and Mr. E. L. Layard is of opinion that the sound\r\nis emitted from two apertures concealed by tufts of wiry bristles thrown\r\nout from each side of the inferior portion of the thorax.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There is another variety of the same moth in Ceylon which\r\nclosely resembles it in its markings, but I have never detected in it\r\nthe utterance of this curious cry. It is smaller than the _A. Satanas_,\r\nand, like it, often enters dwellings at night, attracted by the lights;\r\nbut I have not found its larvæ, although that of the other species is\r\ncommon on several widely different plants.]\r\n\r\n_Moths._--Among the strictly nocturnal _Lepidoptera_ are some gigantic\r\nspecies. Of these the cinnamon-eating _Atlas_, often attains the\r\ndimensions of nearly a foot in the stretch of its superior wings. It is\r\nvery common in the gardens about Colombo, and its size, and the\r\ntransparent talc-like spots in its wings cannot fail to strike even the\r\nmost careless saunterer. But little inferior to it in size is the famed\r\nTusseh silk moth[1], which feeds on the country almond (_Terminalia\r\ncatappa_) and the palma Christi or Castor-oil plant; it is easily\r\ndistinguishable from the Atlas, which has a triangular wing, whilst its\r\n[wing] is falcated, and the transparent spots are covered with a curious\r\nthread-like division drawn across them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Antheroea mylitta_, Drury.]\r\n\r\nTowards the northern portions of the island this valuable species\r\nentirely displaces the other, owing to the fact that the almond and\r\n_palma Christi_ abound there. The latter plant springs up spontaneously\r\non every manure-heap or neglected spot of ground; and might be\r\ncultivated, as in India, with great advantage, the leaf to be used as\r\nfood for the caterpillar, the stalk as fodder for cattle, and the seed\r\nfor the expression of castor-oil. The Dutch took advantage of this\r\nfacility, and gave every encouragement to the cultivation of silk at\r\nJaffna[1], but it never attained such a development as to become an\r\narticle of commercial importance. Ceylon now cultivates no silkworms\r\nwhatever, notwithstanding this abundance of the favourite food of one\r\nspecies; and the rich silken robes sometimes worn by the Buddhist\r\npriesthood are still imported from China and the continent of India.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Portuguese had made the attempt previous to the arrival\r\nof the Dutch, and a strip of land on the banks of the Kalany river near\r\nColombo, still bears the name of Orta Seda, the silk garden. The attempt\r\nof the Dutch to introduce the true silkworm, the _Bombyx mori_, took\r\nplace under the governorship of Ryklof Van Goens, who, on handing over\r\nthe administration to his successor in A.D. 1663, thus apprises him of\r\nthe initiation of the experiment:--\"At Jaffna Palace a trial has been\r\nundertaken to feed silkworms, and to ascertain whether silk may be\r\nreared at that station. I have planted a quantity of mulberry trees,\r\nwhich grow well there, and they ought to be planted in other\r\ndirections.\"--VALENTYN, chap. xiii. The growth of the mulberry trees is\r\nnoticed the year after in a report to the governor-general of India, but\r\nthe subject afterwards ceased to be attended to.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Atlas moth and the Mylitta, there are many other\r\n_Bombycidoe_ in Ceylon; and, though the silk of some of them, were it\r\nsusceptible of being unwound from the cocoon, would not bear a\r\ncomparison with that of the _Bombyx mori_, or even of the Tusseh moth,\r\nit might still prove to be valuable when carded and spun. If the\r\nEuropean residents in the colony would rear the larvæ of these\r\nLepidoptera, and make drawings of their various changes, they would\r\nrender a possible service to commerce, and a certain one to\r\nentomological knowledge.\r\n\r\n_The Wood-carrying Moth._--There is another family of insects, the\r\nsingular habits of which will not fail to attract the traveller in the\r\ncultivated tracts of Ceylon--these are moths of the genus\r\n_Oiketicus_,[1] of which the females are devoid of wings, and some\r\npossess no articulated feet; the larvæ construct for themselves cases,\r\nwhich they suspend to a branch frequently of the pomegranate,[2]\r\nsurrounding them with the stems of leaves, and thorns or pieces of twigs\r\nbound together by threads, till the whole presents the appearance of a\r\nbundle of rods about an inch and a half long; and, from the resemblance\r\nof this to a Roman fasces, one African species has obtained the name of\r\n\"Lictor.\" The German entomologists denominated the group _Sack-träger_,\r\nthe Singhalese call them _Dalmea kattea_ or \"billets of firewood,\" and\r\nregard the inmates as human beings, who, as a punishment for stealing\r\nwood in some former stage of existence, have been condemned to undergo a\r\nmetempsychosis under the form of these insects.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Eumeta_, Wlk.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The singular instincts of a species of Thecla, _Dipsas\r\nIsocrates_, Fab., in connection with the fruit of the pomegranate, were\r\nfully described by Mr. Westwood, in a paper read before the\r\nEntomological Society of London in 1835.]\r\n\r\nThe male, at the close of the pupal rest, escapes from one end of this\r\nsingular covering, but the female makes it her dwelling for life; moving\r\nabout with it at pleasure, and entrenching herself within it, when\r\nalarmed, by drawing together the purse-like aperture at the open end. Of\r\nthese remarkable creatures there are five ascertained species in Ceylon.\r\n_Psyche Doubledaii_, Westw.; _Metisa plana_, Walker; _Eumeta Cramerii_,\r\nWestw.; _E. Templetonii_, Westw.; and _Cryptothelea consorta_, Temp.\r\n\r\nAll the other tribes of minute _Lepidoptera_ have abundant\r\nrepresentatives in Ceylon; some of them most attractive from the great\r\nbeauty of their markings and colouring. The curious little split-winged\r\nmoth (_Pterophorus_) is frequently seen in the cinnamon gardens and the\r\nvicinity of the fort, resting in the noonday heat in the cool grass\r\nshaded by the coco-nut topes. Three species have been captured, all\r\ncharacterised by the same singular feature of having the wings fan-like,\r\nseparated nearly their entire length into detached sections resembling\r\nfeathers in the pinions of a bird expanded for flight.\r\n\r\nHOMOPTERA. _Cicada._--Of the _Homoptera_, the one which will most\r\nfrequently arrest attention is the cicada, which, resting high up on the\r\nbark of a tree, makes the forest re-echo with a long-sustained noise so\r\ncuriously resembling that of a cutler's wheel that the creature which\r\nproduces it has acquired the highly-appropriate name of the\r\n\"knife-grinder.\"\r\n\r\nHEMIPTERA. _Bugs._--On the shrubs in his compound the newly-arrived\r\ntraveller will be attracted by an insect of a pale green hue and\r\ndelicately-thin configuration, which, resting from its recent flight,\r\ncomposes its scanty wings, and moves languidly along the leaf. But\r\nexperience will teach him to limit his examination to a respectful view\r\nof its attitudes; it is one of a numerous family of bugs, (some of them\r\nmost attractive[1] in their colouring,) which are inoffensive if\r\nunmolested, but if touched or irritated, exhale an odour that, once\r\nperceived, is never after forgotten.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Such as _Cantuo ocellatus, Leptopelis Marginalis, Callidea\r\nStockerius_, &c. &c. Of the aquatic species, the gigantic _Belostoma\r\nIndicum_ cannot escape notice, attaining a size of nearly three inches.]\r\n\r\nAPHANIPTERA. _Fleas._--Fleas are equally numerous, and may be seen in\r\nmyriads in the dust of the streets or skipping in the sunbeams which\r\nfall on the clay floors of the cottages. The dogs, to escape them,\r\nselect for their sleeping places spots where a wood fire has been\r\npreviously kindled; and here prone on the white ashes, their stomachs\r\nclose to the earth, and their hind legs extended behind, they repose in\r\ncomparative coolness, and bid defiance to their persecutors.\r\n\r\nDIPTERA. _Mosquitoes._--But of all the insect pests that beset an\r\nunseasoned European the most provoking by far are the truculent\r\nmosquitoes.[1] Even in the midst of endurance from their onslaughts one\r\ncannot but be amused by the ingenuity of their movements; as if aware of\r\nthe risk incident to an open assault, a favourite mode of attack is,\r\nwhen concealed by a table, to assail the ankles through the meshes of\r\nthe blocking, or the knees which are ineffectually protected by a fold\r\nof Russian duck. When you are reading, a mosquito will rarely settle on\r\nthat portion of your hand which is within range of your eyes, but\r\ncunningly stealing by the underside of the book fastens on the wrist or\r\nfinger, and noiselessly inserts his proboscis there. I have tested the\r\nclassical expedient recorded by Herodotus, who states that the fishermen\r\ninhabiting the fens of Egypt cover their beds with their nets, knowing\r\nthat the mosquitoes, although they bite through linen robes, will not\r\nventure though a net.[2] But, notwithstanding the opinion of Spence,[3]\r\nthat nets with meshes an inch square will effectually exclude them, I\r\nhave been satisfied by painful experience that (if the theory is not\r\naltogether fallacious) at least the modern mosquitoes of Ceylon are\r\nuninfluenced by the same considerations which restrained those of the\r\nNile under the successors of Cambyses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Culex laniger_? Wied. In Kandy Mr. Thwaites finds _C.\r\nfuscanus, C. circumvolens_, &c., and one with a most formidable hooked\r\nproboscis, to which he has assigned the appropriate name _C. Regius_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: HERODOTUS, _Euterpe_, xcv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: KIRBY and SPENCE'S _Entomology_, letter iv.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of Ceylon Insects._\r\n\r\nFor the following list of the insects of the island, and the remarks\r\nprefixed to it, I am indebted to Mr. F. Walker, by whom it has been\r\nprepared after a careful inspection of the collections made by Dr.\r\nTempleton, Mr. E.L. Layard, and others; as well as those in the British\r\nMuseum and in the Museum of the East India Company.\r\n\r\n\"A short notice of the aspect of the Island will afford the best means\r\nof accounting, in some degree, for its entomological Fauna: first, as it\r\nis an island, and has a mountainous central region, the tropical\r\ncharacter of its productions, as in most other cases, rather diminishes,\r\nand somewhat approaches that of higher latitudes.\r\n\r\n\"The coast-region of Ceylon, and fully one-third of its northern part,\r\nhave a much drier atmosphere than that of the rest of its surface; and\r\ntheir climate and vegetation are nearly similar to those of the\r\nCarnatic, with which this island may have been connected at no very\r\nremote period.[1] But if, on the contrary, the land in Ceylon is\r\ngradually rising, the difference of its Fauna from that of Central\r\nHindostan is less remarkable. The peninsula of the Dekkan might then be\r\nconjectured to have been nearly or wholly separated from the central\r\npart of Hindostan, and confined to the range of mountains along the\r\neastern coast; the insect-fauna of which is as yet almost unknown, but\r\nwill probably be found to have more resemblance to that of Ceylon than\r\nto the insects of northern and western India--just as the insect-fauna\r\nof Malaya appears more to resemble the similar productions of\r\nAustralasia than those of the more northern continent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: On the subject of this conjecture see _ante_, Vol. I. Pt.\r\nI, ch. i. p. 7.]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Layard's collection was partly formed in the dry northern province\r\nof Ceylon; and among them more Hindostan insects are to be observed than\r\namong those collected by Dr. Templeton, and found wholly in the district\r\nbetween Colombo and Kandy. According to this view the faunas of the\r\nNeilgherry Mountains, of Central Ceylon, of the peninsula of Malacca,\r\nand of Australasia would be found to form one group;--while those of\r\nNorthern Ceylon, of the western Dekkan, and of the level parts of\r\nCentral Hindostan would form another of more recent origin. The\r\ninsect-fauna of the Carnatic is also probably similar to that of the\r\nlowlands of Ceylon; but it is still unexplored. The regions of Hindostan\r\nin which species have been chiefly collected, such as Bengal, Silhet,\r\nand the Punjaub, are at the distance of from 1,300 to 1,600 miles from\r\nCeylon, and therefore the insects of the latter are fully as different\r\nfrom those of the above regions as they are from those of Australasia,\r\nto which Ceylon is as near in point of distance, and agrees more with\r\nregard to latitude.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Hagen has remarked that he believes the fauna of the mountains of\r\nCeylon to be quite different from that of the plains and of the shores.\r\nThe south and west districts have a very moist climate, and as their\r\nvegetation is like that of Malabar, their insect-fauna will probably\r\nalso resemble that of the latter region.\r\n\r\n\"The insects mentioned in the following list are thus distributed:--\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder COLEOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\"The recorded species of _Cicindelidoe_ inhabit the plains or the coast\r\ncountry of Ceylon, and several of them are also found in Hindostan.\r\n\r\n\"Many of the species of _Carabidoe_ and of _Staphylinidoe_, especially\r\nthose collected by Mr. Thwaites, near Kandy, and by M. Nietner at\r\nColombo, have much resemblance to the insects of these two families in\r\nNorth Europe; in the _Scydmoenidoe,_ _Ptiliadoe, Phalacridoe,\r\nNitidulidoe, Colydiadoe_, and _Lathridiadoe_ the northern form is still\r\nmore striking, and strongly contrasts with the tropical forms of the\r\ngigantic _Copridoe, Buprestidoe_, and _Cerambycidoe_, and with the\r\n_Elateridoe, Lampyridoe, Tenebrionidoe, Helopidoe, Meloidoe,\r\nCurculionidoe, Prionidoe, Cerambycidoe, Lamiidoe_, and _Endomychidoe_.\r\n\r\n\"The _Copridoe, Dynastidoe, Melolonthidoe, Cetoniadoe_, and _Passalidoe_\r\nare well represented on the plains and on the coast, and the species are\r\nmostly of a tropical character.\r\n\r\n\"The _Hydrophilidoe_ have a more northern aspect, as is generally the\r\ncase with aquatic species.\r\n\r\n\"The order _Strepsiptera_ is here considered as belonging to the\r\n_Mordellidoe_, and is represented by the genus _Myrmecolax_, which is\r\npeculiar, as yet, to Ceylon.\r\n\r\n\"In the _Curculionidoe_ the single species of _Apion_ will recall to\r\nmind the great abundance of that genus in North Europe.\r\n\r\n\"The _Prionidoe_ and the two following families have been investigated\r\nby Mr. Pascoe, and the _Hispidoe_, with the five following families, by\r\nMr. Baly; these two gentlemen are well acquainted with the above tribes\r\nof beetles, and kindly supplied me with the names of the Ceylon species.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder ORTHOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\"These insects in Ceylon have mostly a tropical aspect. The _Physapoda_,\r\nwhich will probably be soon incorporated with them, are likely to be\r\nnumerous, though only one species has as yet been noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder NEUROPTERA.\r\n\r\n\"The list here given is chiefly taken from the catalogue published by\r\nDr. Hagen, and containing descriptions of the species named by him or by\r\nM. Nietner. They were found in the most elevated parts of the island,\r\nnear Rambodde, and Dr. Hagen informs me that not less than 500 species\r\nhave been noticed in Ceylon, but that they are not yet recorded, with\r\nthe exception of the species here enumerated. It has been remarked that\r\nthe _Trichoptera_ and other aquatic _Neuroptera_ are less local than the\r\nland species, owing to the more equable temperature of the habitation of\r\ntheir larvæ, and on account of their being often conveyed along the\r\nwhole length of rivers. The species of _Psocus_ in the list are far more\r\nnumerous than those yet observed in any other country, with the\r\nexception of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder HYMENOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\"In this order the _Formicidoe_ and the _Poneridoe_ are very numerous,\r\nas they are in other damp and woody tropical countries. Seventy species\r\nof ants have been observed, but as yet few of them have been named. The\r\nvarious other families of aculeate _Hymenoptera_ are doubtless more\r\nabundant than the species recorded indicate, and it may be safely\r\nreckoned that the parasitic _Hymenoptera_ in Ceylon far exceed one\r\nthousand species in number, though they are yet only known by means of\r\nabout two dozen kinds collected at Kandy by Mr. Thwaites.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder LEPIDOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\"The fauna of Ceylon is much better known in this order than in any\r\nother of the insect tribes, but as yet the _Lepidoptera_ alone in their\r\nclass afford materials for a comparison of the productions of Ceylon\r\nwith those of Hindostan and of Australasia; 932 species have been\r\ncollected by Dr. Templeton and by Mr. Layard in the central, western,\r\nand northern parts of the island. All the families, from the\r\n_Papilionidoe_ to the _Tineidoe_, abound, and numerous species and\r\nseveral genera appear, as yet, to be peculiar to the island. As Ceylon\r\nis situate at the entrance to the eastern regions, the list in this\r\nvolume will suitably precede the descriptive catalogues of the\r\nheterocerous _Lepidoptera_ of Hindostan, Java, Borneo, and of other\r\nparts of Australasia, which are being prepared for publication. In some\r\nof the heterocerous families several species are common to Ceylon and to\r\nAustralasia, and in various cases the faunas of Ceylon and of\r\nAustralasia seem to be more similar than those of Ceylon and of\r\nHindostan. The long intercourse between those two regions may have been\r\nthe means of conveying some species from one to the other. Among the\r\n_Pyralites, Hymenia recurvalis_ inhabits also the West Indies, South\r\nAmerica, West Africa, Hindostan, China, Australasia, Australia, and New\r\nZealand; and its food-plant is probably some vegetable which is\r\ncultivated in all those regions; so also _Desmia afflictalis_ is found\r\nin Sierra Leone, Ceylon, and China.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder DIPTERA.\r\n\r\n\"About fifty species were observed by Dr. Templeton, but most of those\r\nhere recorded were collected by Mr. Thwaites at Kandy, and have a great\r\nlikeness to North European species.\r\n\r\n\"The mosquitoes are very annoying on account of their numbers, as might\r\nbe expected from the moisture and heat of the climate. _Culex laniger_\r\nis the coast species, and the other kinds here mentioned are from Kandy.\r\nHumboldt observed that in some parts of South America each stream had\r\nits peculiar mosquitoes, and it yet remains to be seen whether the gnats\r\nin Ceylon are also thus restricted in their habitation. The genera\r\n_Sciara, Cecidomyia_, and _Simulium_, which abound so exceedingly in\r\ntemperate countries, have each one representative species in the\r\ncollection made by Mr. Thwaites. Thus an almost new field remains for\r\nthe Entomologist in the study of the yet unknown Singhalese Diptera,\r\nwhich must be very numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder HEMIPTERA.\r\n\r\n\"The species of this order in the list are too few and too similar to\r\nthose of Hindustan to need any particular mention. _Lecanium coffeoe_\r\nmay be noticed, on account of its infesting the coffee plant, as its\r\nname indicates, and the ravages of other species of the genus will be\r\nremembered, from the fact that one of them, in other regions, has put a\r\nstop to the cultivation of the orange as an article of commerce.\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, it may be observed that the species of insects in Ceylon\r\nmay be estimated as exceeding 10,000 in number, of which about 2,000 are\r\nenumerated in this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass ARACHNIDA.\r\n\r\n\"Four or five species of spiders, of which the specimens cannot be\r\nsatisfactorily described; one _Ixodes_ and one _Chelifer_ have been\r\nforwarded to England from Ceylon by Mr. Thwaites.\"\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The asterisk prefixed denotes the species discovered in Ceylon\r\nsince Sir J.E.

VII\r\n\r\nARACHNIDA--MYRIOPODA--CRUSTACEA, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a few striking exceptions, the true _spiders_ of Ceylon resemble in\r\noeconomy and appearance those we are accustomed to see at home. They\r\nfrequent the houses, the gardens, the rocks and the stems of trees, and\r\nalong the sunny paths, where the forest meets the open country, the\r\n_Epeira_ and her congeners, the true net-weaving spiders, extend their\r\nlacework, the grace of their designs being even less attractive than the\r\nbeauty of the creatures that elaborate them.\r\n\r\nThose that live in the woods select with singular sagacity the\r\nbridle-paths and narrow passages for expanding their nets; no doubt\r\nperceiving that the larger insects frequent these openings for facility\r\nof movement through the jungle; and that the smaller ones are carried\r\ntowards them by the currents of air. These nets are stretched across the\r\npath from four to eight feet above the ground, hung from projecting\r\nshoots, and attached, if possible, to thorny shrubs; and sometimes\r\nexhibit the most remarkable scenes of carnage and destruction. I have\r\ntaken down a ball as large as a man's head consisting of successive\r\nlayers rolled together, in the heart of which was the den of the family,\r\nwhilst the envelope was formed, sheet after sheet, by coils of the old\r\nweb filled with the wings and limbs of insects of all descriptions, from\r\nthe largest moths and butterflies to mosquitoes and minute coleoptera.\r\nEach layer appeared to have been originally suspended across the passage\r\nto intercept the expected prey; and, as it became surcharged with\r\ncarcases, it was loosened, tossed over by the wind or its own weight,\r\nand wrapped round the nucleus in the centre, the spider replacing it by\r\na fresh sheet, to be in turn detached and added to the mass within.\r\n\r\nWalckenaer has described a species of large size, under the name of\r\n_Olios Taprobanius_, which is very common and conspicuous from the fiery\r\nhue of the under surface, the remainder being covered with gray hair so\r\nshort and fine that the body seems almost denuded. It spins a\r\nmoderate-sized web, hung vertically between two sets of strong lines,\r\nstretched one above the other athwart the pathways. Some of the\r\nspider-cords thus carried horizontally from tree to tree at a\r\nconsiderable height from the ground are so strong as to cause a painful\r\ncheck across the face when moving quickly against them; and more than\r\nonce in riding I have had my hat lifted off my head by a single\r\nthread.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Over the country generally are scattered species of\r\n_Gasteracantha_, remarkable for their firm shell-covered bodies, with\r\nprojecting knobs arranged in pairs. In habit these anomalous-looking\r\n_Epeiridæ_ appear to differ in no respect from the rest of the family,\r\nwaylaying their prey in similar situations and in the same manner.\r\n\r\nAnother very singular subgenus, met with in Ceylon, is distinguished by\r\nthe abdomen being dilated behind, and armed with two long spines,\r\narching obliquely backwards. These abnormal kinds are not so handsomely\r\ncoloured as the smaller species of typical form.]\r\n\r\nSeparated by marked peculiarities of structure, as well as of instinct,\r\nfrom the spiders which live in the open air, and busy themselves in\r\nproviding food during the day, the _Mygale fasciata_ is not only\r\nsluggish in its habits, but disgusting in its form and dimensions. Its\r\ncolour is a gloomy brown, interrupted by irregular blotches and faint\r\nbands (whence its trivial name); it is sparingly sprinkled with hairs,\r\nand its limbs, when expanded, stretch over an area of six to eight\r\ninches in diameter. It is familiar to Europeans in Ceylon, who have\r\ngiven it the name, and ascribed to it the fabulous propensities, of the\r\nTarentula.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Species of the true _Tarentulæ_ are not uncommon in Ceylon;\r\nthey are all of very small size, and perfectly harmless.]\r\n\r\nBy day it remains concealed in its den, whence it issues at night to\r\nfeed on larvæ and worms, devouring cockroaches[1] and their pupæ, and\r\nattacking the millepeds, gryllotalpæ, and other fleshy insects. The\r\nMygale is found abundantly in the northern and eastern parts of the\r\nisland, and occasionally in dark unfrequented apartments in the western\r\nprovince; but its inclinations are solitary, and it shuns the busy\r\ntraffic of towns.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. EDGAR L. LAYARD has described the encounter between a\r\nMygale and a cockroach, which he witnessed in the madua of a temple at\r\nAlittane, between Anarajapoora and Dambool. When about a yard apart,\r\neach discerned the other and stood still, the spider with his legs\r\nslightly bent and his body raised, the cockroach confronting him and\r\ndirecting his antennæ with a restless undulation towards his enemy. The\r\nspider, by stealthy movements, approached to within a few inches and\r\npaused, both parties eyeing each other intently: then suddenly a rush, a\r\nscuffle, and both fell to the ground, when the blatta's wings closed,\r\nthe spider seized it under the throat with his claws, and dragging it\r\ninto a corner, the action of his jaws was distinctly audible. Next\r\nmorning Mr. Layard found the soft parts of the body had been eaten,\r\nnothing but the head, thorax, and elytra remaining.--_Ann. & Mag. Nat.\r\nHist._ May, 1853.]\r\n\r\n_Ticks_.--Ticks are to be classed among the intolerable nuisances to the\r\nCeylon traveller. They live in immense numbers in the jungle[1], and\r\nattaching themselves to the plants by the two forelegs, lie in wait to\r\ncatch at unwary animals as they pass. A shower of these diminutive\r\nvermin will sometimes drop from a branch, if unluckily shaken, and\r\ndisperse themselves over the body, each fastening on the neck, the ears,\r\nand eyelids, and inserting a barbed proboscis. They burrow, with their\r\nheads pressed as far as practicable under the skin, causing a sensation\r\nof smarting, as if particles of red hot sand had been scattered over the\r\nflesh. If torn from their hold, the suckers remain behind and form an\r\nulcer. The only safe expedient is to tolerate the agony of their\r\npenetration till a drop of coco-nut oil or the juice of a lime can be\r\napplied, when these little furies drop off without further ill\r\nconsequences. One very large species, dappled with grey, attaches itself\r\nto the buffaloes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. HOOKER, in his _Himalayan Journal_, vol. 1. p. 279, in\r\nspeaking of the multitude of these creatures in the mountains of Nepal,\r\nwonders what they find to feed on, as in these humid forests in which\r\nthey literally swarmed, there was neither pathway nor animal life. In\r\nCeylon they abound everywhere in the plains on the low brushwood; and in\r\nthe very driest seasons they are quite as numerous as at other times. In\r\nthe mountain zone, which is more humid, they are less prevalent. Dogs\r\nare tormented by them; and they display something closely allied to\r\ncunning in always fastening on an animal in those parts where they\r\ncannot be torn off by his paws; on his eyebrows, the tips of his ears,\r\nand the back of his neck. With a corresponding instinct I have always\r\nobserved in the gambols of the Pariah dogs, that they invariably\r\ncommence their attentions by mutually gnawing each other's ears and\r\nnecks, as if in pursuit of ticks from places from which each is unable\r\nto expel them for himself. Horses have a similar instinct; and when they\r\nmeet, they apply their teeth to the roots of the ears of their\r\ncompanions, to the neck and the crown of the head. The buffaloes and\r\noxen are relieved of ticks by the crows which rest on their backs as\r\nthey browse, and free them from these pests. In the low country the same\r\nacceptable office is performed by the \"cattle-keeper heron\" (_Ardea\r\nbubuleus_), which is \"sure to be found in attendance on them while\r\ngrazing; and the animals seem to know their benefactors, and stand\r\nquietly, while the birds peck their tormentors from their\r\nflanks.\"--_Mag. Nat. Hist._ p. 111, 1844.]\r\n\r\n_Mites_.--The _Trombidium tinctorum_ of Hermann is found about Aripo,\r\nand generally over the northern provinces,--where after a shower of rain\r\nor heavy night's dew, they appear in countless myriads. It is about half\r\nan inch long, like a tuft of crimson velvet, and imparts its colouring\r\nmatter readily to any fluid in which it may be immersed. It feeds on\r\nvegetable juices, and is perfectly innocuous. Its European\r\nrepresentative, similarly tinted, and found in garden mould, is commonly\r\ncalled the \"Little red pillion.\"\r\n\r\nMYRIAPODS.--The certainty with which an accidental pressure or unguarded\r\ntouch is resented and retorted by a bite, makes the centipede, when it\r\nhas taken up its temporary abode within a sleeve or the fold of a dress,\r\nby far the most unwelcome of all the Singhalese assailants. The great\r\nsize, too (little short of a foot in length), to which it sometimes\r\nattains, renders it formidable; and, apart from the apprehension of\r\nunpleasant consequences from a wound, one shudders at the bare idea of\r\nsuch hideous creatures crawling over the skin, beneath the innermost\r\nfolds of one's garments.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the _Myriapods_, and pre-eminent from a\r\nsuperiorly-developed organisation, stands the genus _Cermatia_:\r\nsingular-looking objects; mounted upon slender legs, of gradually\r\nincreasing length from front to rear, the hind ones in some species\r\nbeing amazingly prolonged, and all handsomely marked with brown annuli\r\nin concentric arches. These myriapods are harmless, excepting to\r\nwoodlice, spiders, and young cockroaches, which form their ordinary\r\nprey. They are rarely to be seen; but occasionally at daybreak, after a\r\nmore than usually abundant repast, they may be observed motionless, and\r\nresting with their regularly extended limbs nearly flat against the\r\nwalls. On being disturbed they dart away with a surprising velocity, to\r\nconceal themselves in chinks until the return of night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CERMATIA.]\r\n\r\nBut the species to be really dreaded are the true _Scolopendræ_, which\r\nare active and carnivorous, living in holes in old walls and other\r\ngloomy dens. One species[1] attains to nearly the length of a foot, with\r\ncorresponding breadth; it is of a dark purple colour, approaching black,\r\nwith yellowish legs and antennæ, and its whole aspect repulsive and\r\nfrightful. It is strong and active, and evinces an eager disposition to\r\nfight when molested. The _Scolopendræ_ are gifted by nature with a rigid\r\ncoriaceous armour, which does not yield to common pressure, or even to a\r\nmoderate blow; so that they often escape the most well-deserved and\r\nwell-directed attempts to destroy them, seeking refuge in retreats which\r\neffectually conceal them from sight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Scolopendra crassa_, Temp.]\r\n\r\nThere is a smaller one[1], which frequents dwelling-houses, about one\r\nquarter the size of the preceding, of a dirty olive colour, with pale\r\nferruginous legs. It is this species which generally inflicts the wound,\r\nwhen persons complain of being bitten by a scorpion; and it has a\r\nmischievous propensity for insinuating itself into the folds of dress.\r\nThe bite at first does not occasion more suffering than would arise from\r\nthe penetration of two coarsely-pointed needles; but after a little time\r\nthe wound swells, becomes acutely painful, and if it be over a bone or\r\nany other resisting part, the sensation is so intolerable as to produce\r\nfever. The agony subsides after a few hours' duration. In some cases the\r\nbite is unattended by any particular degree of annoyance, and in these\r\ninstances it is to be supposed that the contents of the poison gland had\r\nbecome exhausted by previous efforts, since, if much tasked, the organ\r\nrequires rest to enable it to resume its accustomed functions and to\r\nsecrete a supply of venom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Scolopendra pullipes_.]\r\n\r\n_Millipeds._--In the hot dry season, and in the northern portions of the\r\nisland more especially, the eye is attracted along the edges of the\r\nsandy roads by fragments of the dislocated rings of a huge species of\r\nmillipede,[1] lying in short, curved tubes, the cavity admitting the tip\r\nof the little finger. When perfect the creature is two-thirds of a foot\r\nlong, of a brilliant jet black, and with above a hundred yellow legs,\r\nwhich, when moving onward, present the appearance of a series of\r\nundulations from rear to front, bearing the animal gently forwards. This\r\n_julus_ is harmless, and may be handled with perfect impunity. Its food\r\nconsists chiefly of fruits and the roots and stems of succulent\r\nvegetables, its jaws not being framed for any more formidable purpose.\r\nAnother and a very pretty species,[2] quite as black, but with a bright\r\ncrimson band down the back, and the legs similarly tinted, is common in\r\nthe gardens about Colombo and throughout the western province.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Julus ater_, Temp.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Julus carnifex_, Fab.]\r\n\r\nCRUSTACEA.--The seas around Ceylon abound with marine articulata; but a\r\nknowledge of the crustacea of the island is at present a desideratum;\r\nand with the exception of the few commoner species which frequent the\r\nshores, or are offered in the markets, we are literally without\r\ninformation, excepting the little that can be gleaned from already\r\npublished systematic works.\r\n\r\nIn the bazaars several species of edible crabs are exposed for sale; and\r\namongst the delicacies at the tables of Europeans, curries made from\r\nprawns and lobsters are the triumphs of the Ceylon cuisine. Of these\r\nlatter the fishermen sometimes exhibit specimens[1] of extraordinary\r\ndimensions, and of a beautiful purple hue, variegated with white. Along\r\nthe level shore north and south of Colombo, and in no less profusion\r\nelsewhere, the nimble little Calling Crabs[2] scamper over the moist\r\nsands, carrying aloft the enormous hand (sometimes larger than the rest\r\nof the body), which is their peculiar characteristic, and which, from\r\nits beckoning gesture, has suggested their popular name. They hurry to\r\nconceal themselves in the deep retreats which they hollow out in the\r\nbanks that border the sea.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Palinurus ornatus_, Fab.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Gelasimus tatragonon_? Edw.; _G. annulipes_? Edw.; _G.\r\nDussumieri_? Edw.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALLING CRAB OF CEYLON.]\r\n\r\n_Sand Crabs._--In the same localities, or a little farther inland, the\r\n_ocypode_[1] burrows in the dry soil, making deep excavations, bringing\r\nup literally armfuls of sand; which with a spring in the air, and\r\nemploying its other limbs, it jerks far from its burrows, distributing\r\nit in radii to the distance of several feet.[2] So inconvenient are the\r\noperations of these industrious pests that men are kept regularly\r\nemployed at Colombo in filling up the holes formed by them on the\r\nsurface of the Galle face, which is the only equestrian promenade of the\r\ncapital; but so infested by these active little creatures that accidents\r\noften occur by horses stumbling in their troublesome excavations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ocypode ceratophthalmus_, Pall.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ann. Nat. Hist._ April, 1852. Paper by Mr. EDGAR L.\r\nLAYARD.]\r\n\r\n_Painted Crabs._--On the reefs which lie to the south of the harbour at\r\nColombo, the beautiful little painted crabs,[1] distinguished by dark\r\nred markings on a yellow ground, may be seen all day long running nimbly\r\nin the spray, and ascending and descending in security the almost\r\nperpendicular sides of the rocks which are washed by the waves.\r\n_Paddling Crabs_,[2] with the hind pair of legs terminated by flattened\r\nplates to assist them in swimming, are brought up in the fishermen's\r\nnets. _Hermit Crabs_ take possession of the deserted shells of the\r\nunivalves, and crawl in pursuit of garbage along the moist beach. Prawns\r\nand shrimps furnish delicacies for the breakfast table; and the delicate\r\nlittle pea crab, _Pontonia inflata_,[3] recalls its Mediterranean\r\ncongener,[4] which attracted the attention of Aristotle, from taking up\r\nits habitation in the shell of the living pinna.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Grapsus strigosus_, Herbst.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Neptunus pelagicus_, Linn,; _N. sanguinolentus_, Herbst,\r\n&c. &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: MILNE EDW. _Hist. Nat. Crust._ vol. ii. p. 360.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Pinnotheres veterum._]\r\n\r\nANNELIDÆ.--The marine _Annelides_ of the island have not as yet been\r\ninvestigated; a cursory glance, however, amongst the stones on the beach\r\nat Trincomalie and in the pools, which afford convenient basins for\r\nexamining them, would lead to the belief that the marine species are not\r\nnumerous; tubicole genera, as well as some nereids, are found, but there\r\nseems to be little diversity; though it is not impossible that a closer\r\nscrutiny might be repaid by the discovery of some interesting forms.\r\n\r\n_Leeches._--Of all the plagues which beset the traveller in the rising\r\ngrounds of Ceylon, the most detested are the land leeches.[1] They are\r\nnot frequent in the plains, which are too hot and dry for them; but\r\namongst the rank vegetation in the lower ranges of the hill country,\r\nwhich is kept damp by frequent showers, they are found in tormenting\r\nprofusion. They are terrestrial, never visiting ponds or streams. In\r\nsize they are about an inch in length, and as fine as a common knitting\r\nneedle; but capable of distension till they equal a quill in thickness,\r\nand attain a length of nearly two inches. Their structure is so flexible\r\nthat they can insinuate themselves through the meshes of the finest\r\nstocking, not only seizing on the feet and ankles, but ascending to the\r\nback and throat and fastening on the tenderest parts of the body. The\r\ncoffee planters, who live amongst these pests, are obliged, in order to\r\nexclude them, to envelope their legs in \"leech gaiters\" made of closely\r\nwoven cloth. The natives smear their bodies with oil, tobacco ashes, or\r\nlemon juice;[2] the latter serving not only to stop the flow of blood,\r\nbut to expedite the healing of the wounds. In moving, the land leeches\r\nhave the power of planting one extremity on the earth and raising the\r\nother perpendicularly to watch for their victim. Such is their vigilance\r\nand instinct, that on the approach of a passer-by to a spot which they\r\ninfest, they may be seen amongst the grass and fallen leaves on the edge\r\nof a native path, poised erect, and preparing for their attack on man\r\nand horse. On descrying their prey they advance rapidly by semicircular\r\nstrides, fixing one end firmly and arching the other forwards, till by\r\nsuccessive advances they can lay hold of the traveller's foot, when they\r\ndisengage themselves from the ground and ascend his dress in search of\r\nan aperture to enter. In these encounters the individuals in the rear of\r\na party of travellers in the jungle invariably fare worst, as the\r\nleeches, once warned of their approach, congregate with singular\r\ncelerity. Their size is so insignificant, and the wound they make is so\r\nskilfully punctured, that both are generally imperceptible, and the\r\nfirst intimation of their onslaught is the trickling of the blood or a\r\nchill feeling of the leech when it begins to hang heavily on the skin\r\nfrom being distended by its repast. Horses are driven wild by them, and\r\nstamp the ground in fury to shake them from their fetlocks, to which\r\nthey hang in bloody tassels. The bare legs of the palankin bearers and\r\ncoolies are a favourite resort; and, their hands being too much engaged\r\nto be spared to pull them off, the leeches hang like bunches of grapes\r\nround their ankles; and I have seen the blood literally flowing over the\r\nedge of a European's shoe from their innumerable bites. In healthy\r\nconstitutions the wounds, if not irritated, generally heal, occasioning\r\nno other inconvenience than a slight inflammation and itching; but in\r\nthose with a bad state of body, the punctures, if rubbed, are liable to\r\ndegenerate into ulcers, which may lead to the loss of limb or of life.\r\nBoth Marshall and Davy mention, that during the marches of troops in the\r\nmountains, when the Kandyans were in rebellion, in 1818, the soldiers,\r\nand especially the Madras sepoys, with the pioneers and coolies,\r\nsuffered so severely from this cause that numbers of them perished.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EYES AND TEETH OF THE LAND LEECHES OF CEYLON]\r\n\r\n_Hæmadipsa Ceylanica_, Bosc. Blainv. These pests are not, however;\r\nconfined to Ceylon; they infest the lower ranges of the Himalaya.\r\n--HOOKER, vol. i. p. 107; vol. ii. p. 54. THUNBEBG, who records\r\n(_Travels_, vol. iv. p. 232) having seen them in Ceylon, likewise met\r\nwith them in the forests and slopes of Batavia. MARSDEN (_Hist_. p. 311)\r\ncomplains of them dropping on travellers in Sumatra. KNORR, found them\r\nat Japan; and it is affirmed that they abound in islands farther to the\r\neastward. M. GAY encountered them, in Chili.--MOQUIN-TANDON,\r\n(_Hirudinèes_, p. 211, 346.) It is very doubtful, however, whether all\r\nthese are to be referred to one species. M. DE BLAINVILLE, under _H.\r\nCeylanica_, in the _Diet, de Scien. Nat._ vol. xlvii. p. 271, quotes M.\r\nBOSC as authority for the kind which that naturalist describes being\r\n\"rouges et tachetées;\" which is scarcely applicable to the Singhalese\r\nspecies. It is more than probable therefore, considering the period at\r\nwhich M. BOSC wrote, that he obtained his information from travellers to\r\nthe further east, and has connected with the habitat universally\r\nascribed to them from old KNOX'S work (Part I. chap, vi.) a meagre\r\ndescription, more properly belonging to the land leech of Batavia or\r\nJapan, In all likelihood, therefore, there may be a _H. Boscii,_\r\ndistinct from the _H. Ceylanica._ That which is found in Ceylon is\r\nround, a little flattened on the inferior surface, largest at the\r\nextremity, thence graclimlly tapering forward, and with the anal sucker\r\ncomposed of four rings, and wider in proportion than in other species.\r\nIt is of a clear brown colour, with a yellow stripe the entire length of\r\neach side, and a greenish dorsal one. The body is formed of 100 rings;\r\nthe eyes, of which there are five pairs, are placed in an arch on the\r\ndorsal surface; the first four pairs occupying contiguous rings (thus\r\ndiffering from the water-leeches, which have an unoccupied ring betwixt\r\nthe third and fourth); the fifth pair are located on the seventh ring,\r\ntwo vacant rings intervening. To Dr. Thwaites, Director of the Botanic\r\nGarden at Peradenia, who at my request examined their structure\r\nminutely, I am indebted for the following most interesting particulars\r\nrespecting them. \"I have been giving a little time to the examination of\r\nthe land leech. I find it to have five pairs of ocelli, the first four\r\nseated on corresponding segments, and the posterior pair on the seventh\r\nsegment or ring, the fifth and sixth rings being eyeless (_fig_. A). The\r\nmouth is very retractile, and the aperture is shaped as in ordinary\r\nleeches. The serratures of the teeth, or rather the teeth themselves,\r\nare very beautiful. Each of the three 'teeth,' or cutting instruments,\r\nis principally muscular, the muscular body being very clearly seen. The\r\nrounded edge in which the teeth are set appears to be cartilaginous in\r\nstructure; the teeth are very numerous, (_fig_. B); but some near the\r\nbase have a curious appendage, apparently (I have not yet made this out\r\nquite satisfactorily) set upon one side. I have not yet been able to\r\ndetect the anal or sexual pores. The anal sucker seems to be formed of\r\nfour rings, and on each side above is a sort of crenated flesh-like\r\nappendage. The tint of the common species is yellowish-brown or\r\nsnuff-coloured, streaked with black, with a yellow-greenish dorsal, and\r\nanother lateral line along its whole length. There is a larger species\r\nto be found in this garden with a broad green dorsal fascia; but I have\r\nnot been able to procure one although I have offered a small reward to\r\nany coolie who will bring me one.\" In a subsequent communication Mr.\r\nThwaites remarks \"that the dorsal longitudinal fascia is of the same\r\nwidth as the lateral ones, and differs only in being perhaps slightly\r\nmore green; the colour of the three fasciæ varies from brownish-yellow\r\nto bright green.\" He likewise states \"that the rings which compose the\r\nbody are just 100, and the teeth 70 to 80 in each set, in a single row,\r\nexcept to one end, where they are in a double row.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Minorite friar, ODORIC of Portenau, writing in A.D.\r\n1320, says that the gem-finders who sought the jewels around Adam's\r\nPeak, \"take lemons which they peel, anointing themselves with the juice\r\nthereof, so that the leeches may not be able to hurt them.\"--HAKLUYT,\r\n_Voy._ vol. ii. p. 58.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: DAVY'S _Ceylon_, p. 104; MARSHALL'S _Ceylon_, p. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAND LEECHES.]\r\n\r\nOne circumstance regarding these land leeches is remarkable and\r\nunexplained; they are helpless without moisture, and in the hills where\r\nthey abound at all other times, they entirely disappear during long\r\ndroughts;--yet re-appear instantaneously on the very first fall of rain;\r\nand in spots previously parched, where not one was visible an hour\r\nbefore; a single shower is sufficient to reproduce them in thousands,\r\nlurking beneath the decaying leaves, or striding with rapid movements\r\nacross the gravel. Whence do they re-appear? Do they, too, take a\r\n\"summer sleep,\" like the reptiles, molluscs, and tank fishes, or may\r\nthey be, like the _Rotifera_, dried up and preserved for an indefinite\r\nperiod, resuming their vital activity on the mere recurrence of\r\nmoisture?\r\n\r\nBesides the medicinal leech, a species of which[1] is found in Ceylon,\r\nnearly double the size of the European one, and with a prodigious\r\nfaculty of engorging blood, there is another pest in the low country,\r\nwhich is a source of considerable annoyance, and often of loss, to the\r\nhusbandman. This is the cattle leech[2], which infests the stagnant\r\npools, chiefly in the alluvial lands around the base of the mountain\r\nzone, to which the cattle resort by day, and the wild animals by night,\r\nto quench their thirst and to bathe. Lurking amongst the rank vegetation\r\nwhich fringes these deep pools, and hid by the broad leaves, or\r\nconcealed among the stems and roots covered by the water, there are\r\nquantities of these pests in wait to attack the animals that approach\r\nthem. Their natural food consists of the juices of lumbrici and other\r\ninvertebrata; but they generally avail themselves of the opportunity\r\nafforded by the dipping of the muzzles of the animals into the water to\r\nfasten on their nostrils, and by degrees to make their way to the deeper\r\nrecesses of the nasal passages, and the mucous membranes of the throat\r\nand gullet. As many as a dozen have been found attached to the\r\nepiglottis and pharynx of a bullock, producing such irritation and\r\nsubmucous effusion that death has eventually ensued; and so tenacious\r\nare the leeches that even after death they retain their hold for some\r\nhours.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Hirudo sanguisorba._ The paddifield leech of Ceylon, used\r\nfor surgical purposes, has the dorsal surface of blackish olive, with\r\nseveral longitudinal striæ, more or less defined; the crenated margin\r\nyellow. The ventral surface is fulvous, bordered laterally with olive;\r\nthe extreme margin yellow. The eyes are ranged as in the common\r\nmedicinal leech of Europe; the four anterior ones rather larger than the\r\nothers. The teeth are 140 in each series, appearing as a single row; in\r\nsize diminishing gradually from one end, very close set, and about half\r\nthe width of a tooth apart. When of full size, these leeches are about\r\ntwo inches long, but reaching to six inches when extended. Mr. Thwaites,\r\nto whom I am indebted for these particulars, adds that he saw in a tank\r\nat Colonna Corle leeches which appeared to him flatter and of a darker\r\ncolour than those described above, but that he had not an opportunity of\r\nexamining them particularly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DORSAL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VENTRAL.]\r\n\r\nMr. Thwaites states that there is a smaller tank leech of an olive-green\r\ncolour, with some indistinct longitudinal striæ on the upper surface;\r\nthe crenated margin of a pale yellowish-green; ocelli as in the\r\npaddi-field leech. Length, one inch at rest, three inches when extended.\r\n\r\nMr. E. LAYARD informs us, _Mag. Nat. Hist._ p. 225, 1853, that a\r\nbubbling spring at the village of Tonniotoo, three miles S.W. of\r\nMoeletivoe, supplies most of the leeches used in the island. Those in\r\nuse at Colombo are obtained in the immediate vicinity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Hæmopsis paludum._ In size the cattle leech of Ceylon is\r\nsomewhat larger than the medicinal leech of Europe; in colour it is of a\r\nuniform brown without bands, unless a rufous margin may be so\r\nconsidered. It has dark striæ. The body is somewhat rounded, flat when\r\nswimming, and composed of rather more than ninety rings. The greatest\r\ndimension is a little in advance of the anal sucker; the body thence\r\ntapers to the other extremity, which ends in an upper lip projecting\r\nconsiderably beyond the mouth. The eyes, ten in number, are disposed as\r\nin the common leech. The mouth is oval, the biting apparatus with\r\ndifficulty seen, and the teeth not very numerous. The bite is so little\r\nacute that the moment of attachment and of division of the membrane is\r\nscarcely perceived by the sufferer from its attack.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Even men are not safe, when stooping to drink at a pool,\r\nfrom the assault of the cattle leeches. They cannot penetrate the human\r\nskin, but the delicate membrane of the mucous passages is easily\r\nruptured by their serrated jaws. Instances have come to my knowledge of\r\nEuropeans into whose nostrils they have gained admission and caused\r\nserious disturbance.]\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICULATA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_APTERA_.\r\n\r\nThysanura.\r\n\r\nPodura _albicollis_.\r\n  _atricollis_.\r\n  _viduata_.\r\n  _pilosa_.\r\nAchoreutes _coccinea_.\r\nLepisma nigrofasciata, _Temp. nigra_.\r\n\r\nArachnida.\r\n\r\nButhus afer, _Linn_.\r\n  Ceylonicus, _Koch_.\r\nScorpio _linearis_.\r\nChelifer librorum.\r\n  _oblongus_.\r\nObisium _crassifemur_.\r\nPhrynus lunatus, _Pall_.\r\nThelyphonus caudatus, _Linn_.\r\nPhalangium _bisignatum_.\r\nMygale fasciata, _Walck_.\r\nOlios taprobanius, _Walck_.\r\nNephila...?\r\nTrombidium tinctorum, _Herm_.\r\nOribata...?\r\nIxodes...?\r\n\r\nMyriapoda.\r\n\r\nCermatia _dispar_.\r\nLithobius _umbratilis_.\r\nScolopendra _crassa_.\r\n  spinosa, _Newp_.\r\n  _pallipes_.\r\n  _Grayii?

Such was the opinion of the Portuguese writers DE\r\nBARROS and DE COUTO; and VALENTYN, who, about the year 1725, published\r\nhis great work on the Dutch possessions in India, states his conviction\r\nthat no reliance can be placed on such of the Singhalese books as\r\nprofess to record the ancient condition of the country. These he held to\r\nbe even of less authority than the traditions of the same events which\r\nhad descended from father to son. On the information of learned\r\nSinghalese, drawn apparently from the _Rajavali_, he inserted an account\r\nof the native sovereigns, from the earliest times to the arrival of the\r\nPortuguese; but, wearied by the monotonous inanity of the story, he\r\nomitted every reign between the fifth and fifteenth centuries of the\r\nChristian era.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: VALENTYN, _Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indien, &c., Landbeschryving\r\nvan t' Eyland Ceylon_, ch iv. p. 60.]\r\n\r\nA writer, who, under the signature of PHILALETHES, published, in 1816,\r\n_A History of Ceylon from the earliest period_, adopted the dictum of\r\nValentyn, and contented himself with still further condensing the\r\n\"account,\" which the latter had given \"of the ancient Emperors and\r\nKings\" of the island. Dr. DAVY compiled that portion of his excellent\r\nnarrative which has reference to the early history of Kandy, chiefly\r\nfrom the recitals of the most intelligent natives, borrowed, as in the\r\ncase of the informants of Valentyn, from the perusal of the popular\r\nlegends; and he and every other author unacquainted with the native\r\nlanguage, who wrote on Ceylon previous to 1833, assumed without inquiry\r\nthe nonexistence of historic data.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: DAVY's _Ceylon_, ch. x. p. 293. See also PERCIVAL'S\r\n_Ceylon_, p. 4.]\r\n\r\nIt was not till about the year 1826 that the discovery was made and\r\ncommunicated to Europe, that whilst the history of India was only to be\r\nconjectured from myths and elaborated from the dates on copper grants,\r\nor fading inscriptions on rocks and columns[1], Ceylon was in possession\r\nof continuous written chronicles, rich in authentic facts, and not only\r\npresenting a connected history of the island itself, but also yielding\r\nvaluable materials for elucidating that of India. At the moment when\r\nPrinsep was deciphering the mysterious Buddhist inscriptions, which are\r\nscattered over Hindustan and Western India, and when Csoma de Körös was\r\nunrolling the Buddhist records of Thibet, and Hodgson those of Nepaul, a\r\nfellow labourer of kindred genius was successfully exploring the Pali\r\nmanuscripts of Ceylon, and developing results not less remarkable nor\r\nless conducive to the illustration of the early history of Southern\r\nAsia. Mr. Turnour, a civil officer of the Ceylon service[2], was then\r\nadministering the government of the district of Saffragam, and being\r\nresident at Ratnapoora near the foot of Adam's Peak, he was enabled to\r\npursue his studies under the guidance of Gallé, a learned priest,\r\nthrough whose instrumentality he obtained from the Wihara, at\r\nMulgiri-galla, near Tangalle (a temple founded about 130 years before\r\nthe Christian era), some rare and important manuscripts, the perusal of\r\nwhich gave an impulse and direction to the investigations which occupied\r\nthe rest of his life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: REINAUD, _Mémoire sur l' Inde_, p. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: GEORGE TURNOUR was the eldest son of the Hon. George\r\nTurnour, son of the first Earl of Winterton; his mother being Emilie,\r\nniece to the Cardinal Due de Beausset. He was born in Ceylon in 1799 and\r\nhaving been educated in England under the guardianship of the Right Hon.\r\nSir Thomas Maitland, then governor of the island, he entered the Civil\r\nService in 1818, in which he rose to the highest rank. He was\r\ndistinguished equally by his abilities and his modest display of them.\r\nInterpreting in its largest sense the duty enjoined on him, as a public\r\nofficer, of acquiring a knowledge of the native languages, he extended\r\nhis studies, from the vernacular and written Singhalese to Pali, the\r\ngreat root and original of both, known only to the Buddhist priesthood,\r\nand imperfectly and even rarely amongst them. No dictionaries then\r\nexisted to assist in defining the meaning of Pali terms which no teacher\r\ncould be found capable of rendering into English, so that Mr. Turnour\r\nwas entirely dependent on his knowledge of Singhalese as a medium for\r\ntranslating them. To an ordinary mind such obstructions would have\r\nproved insurmountable, aggravated as they were by discouragements\r\narising from the assumed barrenness of the field, and the absence of all\r\nsympathy with his pursuits, on the part of those around him, who\r\nreserved their applause and encouragement till success had rendered him\r\nindifferent to either. To this apathy of the government officers, Major\r\nForbes, who was then the resident at Matelle, formed an honourable\r\nexception; and his narrative of _Eleven Years in Ceylon_ shows with what\r\nardour and success he shared the tastes and cultivated the studies to\r\nwhich he had been directed by the genius and example of Turnour. So\r\nzealous and unobtrusive were the pursuits of the latter, that even his\r\nimmediate connexions and relatives were unaware of the value and extent\r\nof his acquirements till apprised of their importance and profundity by\r\nthe acclamation with which his discoveries and translations from the\r\nPali were received by the savans of Europe. Major Forbes, in a private\r\nletter, which I have been permitted to see, speaking of the difficulty\r\nof doing justice to the literary character of Turnour, and the ability,\r\nenergy, and perseverance which he exhibited in his historical\r\ninvestigations, says, \"his _Epitome of the History of Ceylon_ was from\r\nthe first _correct;_ I saw it seven years before it was published, and\r\nit scarcely required an alteration afterwards.\" Whilst engaged in his\r\ntranslation of the _Mahawanso_, TURNOUR, amongst other able papers on\r\n_Buddist History_ and _Indian Chronology_ in the _Journal of the Bengal\r\nAsiatic Society_, v. 521, vi. 299, 790, 1049, contributed a series of\r\nessays _on the Pali-Buddhistical Annals_, which were published in 1836,\r\n1837, 1838.--_Journ. Asiatic Soc. Bengal_, vi. 501, 714, vii. 686, 789,\r\n919. At various times he published in the same journal an account of the\r\n_Tooth Relic of Ceylon, Ib._ vi. 856, and notes on the inscriptions on\r\nthe columns of Delhi, Allahabad, and Betiah, &c. &c.; and frequent\r\nnotices of Ceylon coins and inscriptions. He had likewise planned\r\nanother undertaking of signal importance, the translation into English\r\nof a Pali version of the Buddhist scriptures, an ancient copy of which\r\nhe had discovered, unencumbered by the ignorant commentaries of later\r\nwriters, and the fables with which they have defaced the plain and\r\nsimple doctrines of the early faith. He announced his intention in the\r\n_Introduction to the Mahawanso_ to expedite the publication, as \"the\r\nleast tardy means of effecting a comparison of the Pali with the\r\nSanskrit version\" (p. cx.). His correspondence with Prinsep, which I\r\nhave been permitted by his family to inspect, abounds with the evidence\r\nof inchoate inquiries in which their congenial spirits had a common\r\ninterest, but which were abruptly ended by the premature decease of\r\nboth. Turnour, with shattered health, returned to Europe in 1842, and\r\ndied at Naples on the 10th of April in the following year, The first\r\nvolume of his translation of the _Mahawanso_, which contains\r\nthirty-eight chapters out of the hundred which form the original work,\r\nwas published at Colombo in 1837; and apprehensive that scepticism might\r\nassail the authenticity of a discovery so important, he accompanied his\r\nEnglish version with a reprint of the original Pali in Roman characters\r\nwith diacritical points.\r\n\r\nHe did not live to conclude the task he had so nobly begun; he died\r\nwhile engaged on the second volume of his translation, and only a few\r\nchapters, executed with his characteristic accuracy, remain in\r\nmanuscript in the possession of his surviving relatives. It diminishes,\r\nthough in a slight degree, our regret for the interruption of his\r\nliterary labours to know that the section of the _Mahawanso_ which he\r\nleft unfinished is inferior both in authority and value to the earlier\r\nportion of the work, and that being composed at a period when literature\r\nwas at its lowest ebb in Ceylon, it differs little if at all from other\r\nchronicles written during the decline of the native dynasty.]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to premise, that the most renowned of the Singhalese\r\nbooks is the _Mahawanso_, a metrical chronicle, containing a dynastic\r\nhistory of the island for twenty-three centuries from B.C. 543 to A.D.\r\n1758. But being written in Pali verse its existence in modern times was\r\nonly known to the priests, and owing to the obscurity of its diction it\r\nhad ceased to be studied by even the learned amongst them.\r\n\r\nTo relieve the obscurity of their writings, and supply the omissions,\r\noccasioned by the fetters of rhythm and the necessity of permutations\r\nand elisions, required to accommodate their phraseology to the\r\nobligations of verse; the Pali authors of antiquity were accustomed to\r\naccompany their metrical compositions with a _tika_ or running\r\ncommentary, which contained a literal version of the mystical text, and\r\nsupplied illustrations of its more abstruse passages. Such a _tika_ on\r\nthe _Mahawanso_ was generally known to have been written; but so utter\r\nwas the neglect into which both it and the original text had been\r\npermitted to fall, that Turnour till 1826 had never met with an\r\nindividual who had critically read the one, or more than casually heard\r\nof the existence of the other.[1] At length, amongst the books which,\r\nwere procured for him by the high, priest of Saffragam, was one which\r\nproved to be this neglected commentary on the mystic and otherwise\r\nunintelligible _Mahawanso_; and by the assistance of this precious\r\ndocument he undertook, with confidence, a translation into English of\r\nthe long lost chronicle, and thus vindicated the claim of Ceylon to the\r\npossession of an authentic and unrivalled record of its national\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: TURNOUR's _Mahawanso_, introduction, vol. i. p. ii.]\r\n\r\nThe title \"Mahawanso,\" which means literally the \"_Genealogy of the\r\nGreat_,\" properly belongs only to the first section of the work,\r\nextending from B.C. 543 to A.D. 301,[1] and containing the history of\r\nthe early kings, from Wijayo to Maha Sen, with whom the Singhalese\r\nconsider the \"Great Dynasty\" to end. The author of this portion was\r\nMahanamo, uncle of the king Dhatu Sena, in whose reign it was compiled,\r\nbetween the years A.D. 459 and 477, from annals in the vernacular\r\nlanguage then existing at Anarajapoora.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Although the _Mahawanso_ must be regarded as containing the\r\nearliest _historical_ notices of Ceylon, the island, under its Sanskrit\r\nname of Lanka, occupies a prominent place in the mythical poems of the\r\nHindus, and its conquest by Rama is the theme of the _Ramayana_, one of\r\nthe oldest epics in existence. In the _Raja-Tarangini_ also, an\r\nhistorical chronicle which may be regarded as the _Mahawanso_ of\r\nKashmir, very early accounts of Ceylon are contained, and the historian\r\nrecords that the King Megavahana, who, according to the chronology of\r\nTroyer, reigned A.D. 24, made an expedition to Ceylon for the purpose of\r\nextending Buddhism, and visited Adam's Peak, where he had an interview\r\nwith the native sovereign.--_Raja-Tarangini_, Book iii. sl. 71-79. _Ib._\r\nvol. ii. p. 364.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. i. The Arabian travellers in Ceylon\r\nmention the official historiographers employed by order of the kings.\r\nSee Vol. I Pt. III. ch. viii. p. 387, note.]\r\n\r\nThe sovereigns who succeeded Maha Sen are distinguished as the\r\n\"Sulu-wanse,\" the \"lower race,\" and the story of their line occupies the\r\ncontinuation of this extraordinary chronicle, the second portion of\r\nwhich was written by order of the illustrious king Prakrama Bahu, about\r\nthe year A.D. 1266, and the narrative was carried on, under subsequent\r\nsovereigns, down to the year A.D. 1758, the latest chapters having been\r\ncompiled by command of the King of Kandy, Kirti-Sri, partly from\r\nSinghalese works brought back to the island from Siam (whither they had\r\nbeen carried at former periods by priests dispatched upon missions), and\r\npartly from native histories, which had escaped the general destruction\r\nof such records in the reign of Raja Singha I., an apostate from\r\nBuddhism, who, about the year A.D. 1590, during the period when the\r\nPortuguese were in occupation of the low country, exterminated the\r\npriests of Buddha, and transferred the care of the shrine on Adam's Peak\r\nto Hindu Fakirs.\r\n\r\nBut the _Mahawanso_, although the most authentic, and probably the most\r\nancient, is by no means the only existing Singhalese chronicle. Between\r\nthe 14th and 18th centuries several historians recorded passing events;\r\nand as these corroborate and supplement the narrative of the greater\r\nwork, they present an uninterrupted Historical Record of the highest\r\nauthenticity, comprising the events of nearly twenty-four centuries.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In 1833 Upham published, under the title of _The Sacred and\r\nHistorical Books of Ceylon_, translations of what professed to be\r\nauthentic copies of the _Mahawanso_, the _Rajaratnacari_, and\r\n_Rajavali_; prepared for the use of Sir Alexander Johnston when\r\nChief-Justice of the island. But Turnour, in the introduction to his\r\nmasterly translation of the _Mahawanso_; has shown that Sir Alexander\r\nhad been imposed upon, and that the alleged transcripts supplied to him\r\nare imperfect as regards the original text and unfaithful as\r\ntranslations. Of the _Mahawanso_ in particular, Mr. Turnour says, in a\r\nprivate letter which I have seen, that the early part of Upham's volume\r\n\"is not a translation but a compendium of several works, and the\r\nsubsequent portions a mutilated abridgment.\" The _Rajavali_, which is\r\nthe most valuable of these volumes, was translated for Sir Alexander\r\nJohnston by Mr. Dionysius Lambertus Pereira, who was then\r\nInterpreter-Moodliar to the Cutchery at Matura. These English versions,\r\nthough discredited as independent authorities, are not without value in\r\nso far as they afford corroborative support to the genuine text of the\r\n_Mahawanso_, and on this account I have occasionally cited them.]\r\n\r\nFrom the data furnished by these, and from corroborative sources,[1]\r\nTurnour, in addition to many elaborate contributions drawn from the\r\nrecesses of Pali learning in elucidation of the chronology of India, was\r\nenabled to prepare an _Epitome of the History of Ceylon,_ in which he\r\nhas exhibited the succession and genealogy of one hundred and sixty-five\r\nkings, who filled the throne during 2341 years, extending from the\r\ninvasion of the island from Bengal, by Wijayo, in the year B.C. 543 to\r\nits conquest by the British in 1798. In this work, after infinite\r\nlabour, he has succeeded in condensing the events of each reign,\r\ncommemorating the founders of the chief cities, and noting the erection\r\nof the great temples and Buddhist monuments, and the construction of\r\nsome of those gigantic reservoirs and works for irrigation, which,\r\nthough in ruins, arrest the traveller in astonishment at their\r\nstupendous dimensions. He thus effectually demonstrated the\r\nmisconceptions of those who previously believed the literature of Ceylon\r\nto be destitute of historic materials.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Besides the _Mahawanso, Rajaratnacari_, and _Rajavali_, the\r\nother native chronicles relied on by Turnour in compiling his epitome\r\nwere the _Pujavali_, composed in the thirteenth century, the\r\n_Neekaasangraha_, written A.D. 1347, and the _Account of the Embassy to\r\nSiam_ in the reign of Raja Singha II., A.D. 1739-47, by WILBAAGEDERE\r\nMUDIANSE.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: By the help of TURNOUR'S translation of the _Mahawanso_ and\r\nthe versions of the _Rajaratnacari_ and _Rajavali,_ published by Upham,\r\ntwo authors have since expanded the _Epitome_ of the former into\r\nsomething like a connected narrative, and those who wish to pursue the\r\ninvestigation of the early story of the island, will find facilities in\r\nthe _History of Ceylon,_ published by KNIGHTON in 1845, and in the first\r\nvolume of _Ceylon and its Dependencies,_ by PRIDHAM, London, 1849. To\r\nfacilitate reference I have appended a _Chronological List of Singhalese\r\nSovereigns,_ compiled from the historical epitome of Turnour. See Note\r\nB. at the end of this chapter.]\r\n\r\nBesides evidence of a less definite character, there is one remarkable\r\ncoincidence which affords grounds for confidence in the faithfulness of\r\nthe purely historic portion of the Singhalese chronicles; due allowance\r\nbeing made for that exaggeration of style which is apparently\r\ninseparable from oriental recital. The circumstance alluded to is the\r\nmention in the _Mahawanso_ of the Chandragupta[1], so often alluded to\r\nby the Sanskrit writers, who, as Sir William Jones was the first to\r\ndiscover, is identical with Sandracottus or Sandracoptus, the King of\r\nthe Prasii, to whose court, on the banks of the Ganges, Megasthenes was\r\naccredited as an ambassador from Seleucus Nicator, about 323 years\r\nbefore Christ. Along with a multitude of facts relating to Ceylon, the\r\n_Mahawanso_ contains a chronologically connected history of Buddhism in\r\nIndia from B.C. 590 to B.C. 307, a period signalized in classical story\r\nby the Indian expedition of Alexander the Great, and by the Embassy of\r\nMegasthenes to Palibothra,--events which in their results form the great\r\nlink connecting the histories of the West and East, but which have been\r\nomitted or perverted in the scanty and perplexed annals of the Hindus,\r\nbecause they tended to the exaltation of Buddhism, a religion loathed by\r\nthe Brahmans.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The era and identity of Sandracottus and Chandragupta have\r\nbeen accurately traced in MAX MÜLLER'S _History of Sanskrit Literature_,\r\np. 298, &c.]\r\n\r\nThe Prasii, or people of Megadha, occupy a prominent place in the\r\nhistory of Ceylon, inasmuch as Gotama Buddha, the great founder of the\r\nfaith of its people, was a prince of that country, and Mahindo, who\r\nfinally established the Buddhist religion amongst them, was the\r\ngreat-grandson of Chandagutto, a prince whose name thus recorded in the\r\n_Mahawanso_[1] (notwithstanding a chronological discrepancy of about\r\nsixty years), may with little difficulty be identified with the\r\n\"Chandragupta\" of the Hindu Purána, and the \"Sandracottus\" of\r\nMegasthenes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mahawanso, ch. v. p. 21. See also WILSON'S _Notes to the\r\nVishnu Purána_, p. 468.]\r\n\r\nThis is one out of the many coincidences which demonstrate the\r\nauthenticity of the ancient annals of Ceylon; and from sources so\r\nvenerable, and materials so abundant, I propose to select a few of the\r\nleading events, sufficient to illustrate the origin, and explain the\r\ninfluence of institutions and customs which exist at the present day in\r\nCeylon, and which, from time immemorial, have characterised the\r\ninhabitants of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE (A.)\r\n\r\nANCIENT MAP OF CEYLON.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am aware, no map has ever been produced, exhibiting the\r\ncomparative geography of Ceylon, and placing its modern names in\r\njuxtaposition with their Sanskrit and Pali.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nLANGKÂ OR TÂMBRAPARNI.\r\n\r\n_(CEYLON)_\r\n\r\n_according to_\r\n\r\nThe Sanscrit Pali & Singhalese Authorities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNB The modern Names are given in Italics.\r\n\r\nBy\r\n\r\nSir J.

II.\r\n\r\nTHE ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF CEYLON.\r\n\r\nDivested of the insipid details which overlay them, the annals of Ceylon\r\npresent comparatively few stirring incidents, and still fewer events of\r\nhistoric importance to repay the toil of their perusal. They profess to\r\nrecord no occurrence anterior to the advent of the last Buddha, the\r\ngreat founder of the national faith, who was born on the borders of\r\nNepaul in the _seventh_ century before Christ.\r\n\r\nIn the theoretic doctrines of Buddhism \"_Buddhas_\"[1] are beings who\r\nappear after intervals of inconceivable extent; they undergo\r\ntransmigrations extending over vast spaces of time, accumulating in each\r\nstage of existence an increased degree of merit, till, in their last\r\nincarnation as men, they attain to a degree of purity so immaculate as\r\nto entitle them to the final exaltation of \"Buddha-hood,\" a state\r\napproaching to incarnate divinity, in which they are endowed with wisdom\r\nso supreme as to be competent to teach mankind the path to ultimate\r\nbliss.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A sketch of the Buddhist religion may be seen in Sir J.\r\nEMERSON TENNENT'S _History of Christianity in Ceylon_, ch. v. London,\r\n1850. But the most profound and learned dissertations on Buddhism as it\r\nexists in Ceylon, will be found in the works of the Rev. R. SPENCE\r\nHARDY, _Eastern Monachism_, Lond. 1850, and _A Manual of Buddhism_,\r\nLond. 1853.]\r\n\r\nTheir precepts, preserved orally or committed to writing, are cherished\r\nas _bana_ or the \"_word_;\" their doctrines are incorporated in the\r\nsystem of _dharma_ or \"_truth_;\" and, at their death, instead of\r\nentering on a new form of being, either corporeal or spiritual, they are\r\nabsorbed into _Nirwana_, that state of blissful unconsciousness akin to\r\nannihilation which is regarded by Buddhists as the consummation of\r\neternal felicity.\r\n\r\nGotama, who is represented as the last of the series of Buddhas[1],\r\npromulgated a religious system in India which has exercised a wider\r\ninfluence over the Eastern world than the doctrines of any other\r\nuninspired teacher in any age or country.[2] He was born B.C. 624 at\r\nKapila-Vastu (a city which has no place in the geography of the Hindus,\r\nbut which appears to have been on the borders of Nepaul); he attained\r\nhis superior Buddha-hood B.C. 588, under a bo-tree[3] in the forest of\r\nUrawela, the site of the present Buddha Gaya in Bahar; and, at the age\r\nof eighty, he died at Kusinara, a doubtful locality, which it has been\r\nsought to identify with the widely separated positions of Delhi, Assam,\r\nand Cochin China.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There were twenty-four Buddhas previous to the advent of\r\nGotama, who is the fourth in the present Kalpa or chronological period.\r\nHis system of doctrine is to endure for 5000 years, when it will be\r\nsuperseded by the appearance and preaching of his\r\nsuccessor.--_Rajaratnacari_, ch. i. p. 42.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: HARDY'S _Eastern Monachism_, ch. i. p. 1. There is evidence\r\nof the widely-spread worship of Buddha in the remotely separated\r\nindividuals with whom it has been sought at various times to identify\r\nhim. \"Thus it has been attempted to show that Buddha was the same as\r\nThoth of the Egyptians, and Turm of the Etruscans, that he was Mercury,\r\nZoroaster, Pythagoras, the Woden of the Scandinavians, the Manes of the\r\nManichæans, the prophet Daniel, and even the divine author of\r\nChristianity.\" (PROFESSOR WILSON, _Journ. Asiat. Soc._, vol. xvi. p.\r\n233.) Another curious illustration of the prevalence of his doctrines\r\nmay be discovered in the endless variations of his name in the numerous\r\ncountries over which his influence has extended: Buddha, Budda, Bud,\r\nBot, Baoth, Buto, Budsdo, Bdho, Pout, Pote, Fo, Fod, Fohi, Fuh, Pet,\r\nPta, Poot, Phthi, Phut, Pht, &c.--POCOCKE'S _India in Greece_, appendix,\r\n397. HARDY'S _Buddhism_, ch. vii. p. 355. HARDY in his _Eastern\r\nMonachism_ says, \"There is no country in either Europe or Asia, _except\r\nthose that are Buddhist_, in which the same religion is now professed\r\nthat was there existent at the time of the Redeemer's death,\" ch. xxii.\r\np. 327.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The Pippul, _Ficus religiosa_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Professor H.H. WILSON has identified Kusinara or Kusinagara\r\nwith _Kusia_ in Gorakhpur, _Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc._, vol xvi. p. 246.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of his ministrations Gotarna is said to have thrice landed\r\nin Ceylon. Prior to his first coming amongst them, the inhabitants of\r\nthe island appear to have been living in the simplest and most primitive\r\nmanner, supported on the almost spontaneous products of the soil. Gotama\r\nin person undertook their conversion, and alighted on the first occasion\r\nat Bintenne, where there exists to the present day the remains of a\r\nmonument erected two thousand years ago[1] to commemorate his arrival.\r\nHis second visit was to Nagadipo in the north of the island, at a place\r\nwhose position yet remains to be determined; and the \"sacred foot-print\"\r\non Adam's Peak is still worshipped by his devotees as the miraculous\r\nevidence of his third and last farewell.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: By Dutugaimunu, B.C. 164. For an account of the present\r\ncondition of this Dagoba at Bintenne, see Vol. II. Pt. IX. ch. ii.]\r\n\r\nTo the question as to what particular race the inhabitants of Ceylon at\r\nthat time belonged, and whence or at what period the island was\r\noriginally peopled, the Buddhist chronicles furnish no reply. And no\r\nmemorials of the aborigines themselves, no monuments or inscriptions,\r\nnow remain to afford ground for speculation. Conjectures have been\r\nhazarded, based on no sufficient data, that the Malayan type, which\r\nextends from Polynesia to Madagascar, and from Chin-India to Taheite,\r\nmay still be traced in the configuration, and in some of the immemorial\r\ncustoms, of the people of Ceylon.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Amongst the incidents ingeniously pressed into the support\r\nof this conjecture is the use by the natives of Ceylon of those _double\r\ncanoes_ and _boats with outriggers_, which are never used on the Arabian\r\nside of India, but which are peculiar to the Malayan race in almost\r\nevery country to which they have migrated; Madagascar and the Comoro\r\nislands, Sooloo, Luzon, the Society Islands, and Tonga.

It is stated in the introduction to RIBEYRO'S\r\n_History of Ceylon_, but rejected by VALENTYN, ch, iv. p. 61.\r\n\r\nThe legend prefixed to RIBEYRO is as follows. \"Si nous en croyons les\r\nhistoriens Portugais, les Chinois out été les premiers qui ont habité\r\ncette isle, et cela arriva de cette manière. Ces peuples étoient les\r\nmaîtres du commerce de tout l'orient; quelques unes de leurs vaisseaux\r\nfurent portéz sur les basses qui sont près du lieu, que depuis on\r\nappelle Chilao par corruption au lieu de Cinilao. Les équipages se\r\nsauvèrent à terre, et trouvant le pais bon et fertile ils s'y\r\nétablirent: bientôt après ils s'allièrent avec les Malabares, et les\r\nMalabares y envoyoient ceux qu'ils exiloient et qu'ils nominoient\r\n_Galas_. Ces exiles s'étant confondus avec les Chinois, de deux noms\r\nn'en out fait qu'un, et se sont appellés _Chin-galas_ et ensuite\r\nChingalais.\"--RIBEYRO, _Hist. de Ceylan_, pref. du trad.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to observe in reference to this hypothesis that it\r\nis at variance with the structure of the Singhalese alphabet, in which\r\n_n_ and _g_ form but one letter. DE BARROS and DE COUTO likewise adhere\r\nto the theory of a mixed race, originating in the settlement of Chinese\r\nin the south of Ceylon, but they refer the event to a period subsequent\r\nto the seizure of the Singhalese king and his deportation to China in\r\nthe fifteenth century. DE BARROS, Dec. iii. ch. i.; DE COUTO, Dec. v.\r\nch. 5.]\r\n\r\nBut the greater probability is, that a branch of the same stock which\r\noriginally colonised the Dekkan extended its migrations to Ceylon. All\r\nthe records and traditions of the peninsula point to a time when its\r\nnations were not Hindu; and in numerous localities[1], in the forests\r\nand mountains of the peninsula, there are still to be found the remnants\r\nof tribes who undoubtedly represent the aboriginal race.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: LASSEN, _Indische Alterthumskunde_, vol. i. p. 199, 362.]\r\n\r\nThe early inhabitants of India before their comparative civilisation\r\nunder the influence of the Aryan invaders, like the aborigines of Ceylon\r\nbefore the arrival of their Bengal conquerors, are described as\r\nmountaineers and foresters who were \"rakshas\" or demon worshippers; a\r\nreligion, the traces of which are to be found to the present day amongst\r\nthe hill tribes in the Concan and Canara, as well as in Guzerat and\r\nCutch. In addition to other evidences of the community of origin of\r\nthese continental tribes and the first inhabitants of Ceylon, there is a\r\nmanifest identity, not alone in their popular superstitions at a very\r\nearly period, but in the structure of the national dialects, which are\r\nstill prevalent both in Ceylon and Southern India. Singhalese, as it is\r\nspoken at the present day, and, still more strikingly, as it exists as a\r\nwritten language in the literature of the island, presents unequivocal\r\nproofs of an affinity with the group of languages still in use in the\r\nDekkan; Tamil, Telingu, and Malayalim. But with these its identification\r\nis dependent on analogy rather than on structure, and all existing\r\nevidence goes to show that the period at which a vernacular dialect\r\ncould have been common to the two countries must have been extremely\r\nremote.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The _Mahawanso_ (ch. xiv.) attests that at the period of\r\nWijayo's conquest of Ceylon, B.C. 543, the language of the natives was\r\ndifferent from that spoken by himself and his companions, which, as they\r\ncame from Bengal, was in all probability Pali. Several centuries\r\nafterwards, A.D. 339, the dialect of the two races was still different;\r\nand some of the sacred writings were obliged to be translated from Pali\r\ninto the Sihala language.--_Mahawanso_, ch. xxxvii. xxxviii. p. 247. At\r\na still later period, A.D. 410; a learned priest from Magadha translated\r\nthe Attah-Katha from Singhalese into Pali.--_Ib_. p. 253. See also DE\r\nALWIS, _Sidath-Sangara_, p. 19.]\r\n\r\nThough not based directly on either Sanskrit or Pali, Singhalese at\r\nvarious times has been greatly enriched from both sources, and\r\nespecially from the former; and it is corroborative of the inference\r\nthat the admixture was comparatively recent; and chiefly due to\r\nassociation with domiciliated strangers, that the further we go back in\r\npoint of time the proportion of amalgamation diminishes, and the dialect\r\nis found to be purer and less alloyed. Singhalese seems to bear towards\r\nSanskrit and Pali a relation similar to that which the English of the\r\npresent day bears to the combination of Latin, Anglo-Saxon, and Norman\r\nFrench, which serves to form the basis of the language. As in our own\r\ntongue the words applicable to objects connected with rural life are\r\nAnglo-Saxon, whilst those indicative of domestic refinement belong to\r\nthe French, and those pertaining to religion and science are borrowed\r\nfrom Latin[1]; so, in the language of Ceylon, the terms applicable to\r\nthe national religion are taken from Pali, those of science and art from\r\nSanskrit, whilst to pure Singhalese belong whatever expressions were\r\nrequired to denote the ordinary wants of mankind before society had\r\nattained organisation.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See TRENCH on the _Study of Words_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See DE ALWIS, _Sidath-Sangara_, p. xlviii.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 543.]\r\n\r\nWhatever momentary success may have attended the preaching of Buddha, no\r\ntraces of his pious labours long survived him in Ceylon. The mass of its\r\ninhabitants were still aliens to his religion, when, on the day of his\r\ndecease, B.C. 543, Wijayo[1], the discarded son of one of the petty\r\nsovereigns in the valley of the Ganges[2] effected a landing with a\r\nhandful of followers in the vicinity of the modern Putlam.[3] Here he\r\nmarried the daughter of one of the native chiefs, and having speedily\r\nmade himself master of the island by her influence, he established his\r\ncapital at Tamana Neuera[4], and founded a dynasty, which, for nearly\r\neight centuries, retained supreme authority in Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Sometimes spelled _Wejaya_. TURNOUR has demonstrated that\r\nthe alleged concurrence of the death of Buddha and the landing of Wijayo\r\nis a device of the sacred annalists, in order to give a pious interest\r\nto the latter event, which took place about sixty years later.--Introd\r\n_Mahawanso_, p. liii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: To facilitate reference to the ancient divisions of India,\r\na small map is subjoined, chiefly taken from Lassen's _Indische\r\nAlterthumskunde_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF ANCIENT INDIA.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: BURNOUF conjectures that the point from which Wijayo set\r\nsail for Ceylon was the Godavery, where the name of Bandar-maha-lanka\r\n(the Port of the Great Lanka), still commemorates the event.--_Journ.\r\nAsiat._ vol. xviii. p. 134.

The Nagas, another\r\nsection of the same superstition, worshipped the cobra de capello as an\r\nemblem of the destroying power. These appear to have chiefly inhabited\r\nthe northern and western coasts of Ceylon, and the Yakkhos the\r\ninterior[5]; and, notwithstanding their alleged barbarism, both had\r\norganised some form of government, however rude.[6] The Yakkhos had a\r\ncapital which they called Lankapura, and the Nagas a king, the\r\npossession of whose \"throne of gems\"[7] was disputed by the rival\r\nsovereign of a neighbouring kingdom. So numerous were the followers of\r\nthis gloomy idolatry of that time in Ceylon, that they gave the name of\r\nNagadipo[8], _the_ _Island of Serpents_, to the portion of the country\r\nwhich they held, in the same manner that Rhodes and Cyprus severally\r\nacquired the ancient designation of _Ophiusa_, from the fact of their\r\nbeing the residence of the Ophites, who introduced serpent-worship into\r\nGreece.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. vii.; FA HIAN, _Fo[)e]-kou[)e]-ki_, ch.\r\nxxxvii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajavali_, p. 169.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: REINAUD, Introd. to _Abouldfeda_, vol. i. sec. iii. p.\r\nccxvi.

The _Mahawanso_ in many passages alludes to the existence of\r\nNaga kingdoms on the continent of India, showing that at that time\r\nserpent-worship had not been entirely extinguished by Brahmanism in the\r\nDekkan, and affording an additional ground for conjecture that the first\r\ninhabitants of Ceylon were a colony from the opposite coast of Calinga.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: BRYANT'S _Analysis of Mythology_, chapter on Ophiolatria,\r\nvol. i p. 480, \"Euboea means _Oub-aia_, and signifies the serpent\r\nisland.\" (_Ib_.)\r\n\r\nBut STRABO affords us a still more striking illustration of the\r\n_Mahawanso_, in calling the serpent worshippers of Ceylon \"Serpents,\"\r\nsince he states that in Phrygia and on the Hellespont the people who\r\nwere styled [Greek: ophiogeneis], or the Serpent races, actually\r\nretained a physical affinity with the snakes with whom they were\r\npopularly identified, [Greek: \"entautha mytheuousi tous Ophiogeneis\r\nsyngenneian tina echein pros tous oseis.\"]--STRABO, lib. xiii. c. 588.\r\n\r\nPLINY alludes to the same fable (lib. vii.). And OVID, from the incident\r\nof Cadmus' having sown the dragon's teeth (that is, implanted\r\nOphiolatria in Greece), calls the Athenians _Serpentigenæ_.]\r\n\r\nBut whatever were the peculiarities of religion which distinguished the\r\naborigines from their conquerors, the attention of Wijayo was not\r\ndiverted from his projects of colonisation by any anxiety to make\r\nconverts to his own religious belief. The earliest cares of himself and\r\nhis followers were directed to implant civilisation, and two centuries\r\nwere permitted to elapse before the first effort was made to supersede\r\nthe popular worship by the inculcation of a more intellectual faith.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION IN THE MAHAWANSO OF THE LANDING OF WIJAYO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe landing of Wijayo in Ceylon is related in the 7th chapter of the\r\n_Mahawanso_, and Mr. TURNOUR has noticed the strong similarity between\r\nthis story and Homer's account of the landing of Ulysses in the island\r\nof Circe. The resemblance is so striking that it is difficult to\r\nconceive that the Singhalese historian of the 5th century was entirely\r\nignorant of the works of the Father of Poetry. Wijayo and his followers,\r\nhaving made good their landing, are met by a \"devo\" (a divine spirit),\r\nwho blesses them and ties a sacred thread as a charm on the arm of each.\r\nOne of the band presently discovers the princess in the person of a\r\ndevotee, seated near a tank, and she being a magician (Yakkhini)\r\nimprisons him and eventually the rest of his companions in a cave. The\r\n_Mahawanso_ then proceeds: \"all these persons not returning, Wijayo,\r\nbecoming alarmed, equipping himself with the five weapons of war,\r\nproceeded after them, and examined the delightful pond: he could\r\nperceive no footsteps but those leading down into it, and there he saw\r\nthe princess. It occurred to him his retinue must surely have been\r\nseized by her, and he exclaimed, 'Pray, why dost not thou produce my\r\nattendants?' 'Prince,' she replied, 'from attendants what pleasure canst\r\nthou derive? drink and bathe ere thou departest.' Seizing her by the\r\nhair with his left hand, whilst with his right he raised his sword, he\r\nexclaimed, 'Slave, deliver my followers or die.' The Yakkhini terrified,\r\nimplored for her life; 'Spare me, prince, and on thee will I bestow\r\nsovereignty, my love, and my service.' In order that he might not again\r\nbe involved in difficulty he forced her to swear[1], and when he again\r\ndemanded the liberation of his attendants she brought them forth, and\r\ndeclaring 'these men must be famishing,' she distributed to them rice\r\nand other articles procured from the wrecked ships of mariners, who had\r\nfallen a prey to her. A feast follows, and Wijayo and the princess\r\nretire to pass the night in an apartment which she causes to spring up\r\nat the foot of a tree, curtained as with a wall and fragrant with\r\nincense.\" It is impossible not to be struck with a curious resemblance\r\nbetween this description and that in the 10th book of the Odyssey, where\r\nEurylochus, after landing, returns to Ulysses to recount the fate of his\r\ncompanions, who, having wandered towards the palace of Circe, had been\r\nimprisoned after undergoing transformation into swine. Ulysses hastens\r\nto their relief, and having been provided by Mercury with antidotes,\r\nwhich enabled him to resist the poisons of the sorceress, whom he\r\ndiscovers in her retreat, the story proceeds:--\r\n\r\n[Greek:\r\n\r\n  Ôs phat egô d aor oxu eryssamenos para mêrou\r\n  Kirkêepêixa hôste ktameuai meneainôn. k. t. l.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: [Greek:\r\n\r\n  Ei mê moi tlaiês ge, thea, megan horkon homossai\r\n  Mêti moi autps pêma kakon bouleusemen allo.]--_Odys_. x. l. 343.]\r\n\r\n  \"She spake, I, drawing from beside my thigh\r\n  The faulchion keen, with death denouncing looks,\r\n  Rush'd on her,--she, with a shrill scream of fear,\r\n  Ran under my raised arm, seized fast my knees,\r\n  And in winged accents plaintive thus began:--\r\n  'Who, whence thy city, and thy birth declare,--\r\n  Amazed I see thee with that potion drenched,\r\n  Yet unenchanted: never man before\r\n  Once passed it through his lips and lived the same.\r\n  *      *        *        *    Sheath again\r\n  Thy sword, and let us on my bed recline,\r\n  Mutual embrace, that we may trust henceforth\r\n  Each other without jealousy or fear.'\r\n  The goddess spake, to whom I thus replied:\r\n  'Oh Circe, canst thou bid me meek become,\r\n  And gentle, who beneath thy roof detain'st\r\n  My fellow-voyagers.      *        *        *\r\n  No, trust me, never will I share thy bed,\r\n  Till first, oh goddess, thou consent to swear\r\n  That dread, all-binding oath, that other harm\r\n  Against myself, thou wilt imagine none.'\r\n  I spake, she, swearing as I bade, renounced\r\n  All evil purpose, and her solemn oath\r\n  Concluded, I ascended next her bed.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: COWPER's _Odyssey_, B. x, p. 392.]\r\n\r\nThe story of Wijayo's interview with Kuweni is told in nearly the same\r\nterms as it appeared in the _Mahawanso_ in the _Rajavali_, p. 172.\r\n\r\nAnother classical coincidence is curious: we are strongly reminded of\r\nHomer's description of the Syrens by the following passage, relative to\r\nthe female _Rakshasis_, or demons, by whom Ceylon was originally\r\ninhabited, which is given in the memoirs of HIOUEN-THSANG, the Chinese\r\ntraveller in the 7th century, as extracted by him from the Buddhist\r\nChronicles. \"Elles épiaient constamment les marchands qui abordaient\r\ndans l'isle, et se changeant en femmes d'une grande beauté elles\r\nvenaient au-devant d'eux avec des fleurs odorantes et au son des\r\ninstruments de musique, leur adressaient des paroles bienveillantes et\r\nles attiraient dans la ville de fer. Alors elles leur offraient un\r\njoyeux festin et se livraient au plaisir avec eux: puis elles les\r\nenfermaient dans un prison de fer et les mangeaient l'un après\r\nl'autre.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: HIOUEN-THSANG, _Mém. des Péler. Boudd_. 1. xi. p. 131.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF CEYLON BY WIJAYO, B.C. 543, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF\r\nBUDDHISM, B.C. 307.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 543.]\r\n\r\nThe sacred historians of Ceylon affect to believe in the assertion of\r\nsome mysterious connection between the landing of Wijayo, and the\r\nconversion of Ceylon to Buddhism, one hundred and fifty years\r\nafterwards; and imply that the first event was but a pre-ordained\r\nprecursor of the second.[1] The Singhalese narrative, however, admits\r\nthat Wijayo was but a \"lawless adventurer,\" who being expelled from his\r\nown country, was refused a settlement on the coast of India before he\r\nattempted Ceylon, which had previously attracted the attention of other\r\nadventurers. This story is in no way inconsistent with that told by the\r\nChinese Buddhists, who visited the island in the fifth and seventh\r\ncenturies. FA HIAN states, that even before the advent of Buddha, Ceylon\r\nwas the resort of merchants, who repaired there to exchange their\r\ncommodities for gems, which the \"demons\" and \"serpents,\" who never\r\nappeared in person, deposited on the shore, with a specified value\r\nattached to each, and in lieu of them the strangers substituted certain\r\nindicated articles, and took their departure.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. vii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: FA HIAN, _Fo[)e]-Kou[)e]-ki_, ch. xxxviii. See a notice of\r\nthis story of FA HIAN, as it applies to the still existing habits of the\r\nVeddahs, Vol. I. Pt III. ch. vii.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 543.]\r\n\r\nHIOUEN-THSANG, at a later period, disposes of the fables of Wijayo's\r\ndescent from a lion[1], and of his divine mission to Ceylon, by\r\nintimating, that, according to certain authorities, he was the son of a\r\nmerchant (meaning a sea-faring trader), who, having appeased the enmity\r\nof the Yakkhos, succeeded by his discretion in eventually making himself\r\ntheir king.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The legend of Wijayo's descent from a lion, probably\r\noriginated from his father being the son of an outlaw named \"Singha.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"Suivant certains auteurs, Sengkia-lo (Wijayo) serait le\r\nnom du fils d'un marchand, qui, par sa prudence, ayant échappé à la\r\nfureur homicide des Lo-tsa\" (demons) \"réussit ensuite à se faire\r\nRoi.\"--HIOUEN THSANG, _Voyages &c_. l. iv. p. 198.]\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been his first intentions, his subsequent policy was\r\nrather that of an agriculturist than an apostle. Finding the country\r\nrich and fertile, he invited merchants to bring their families, and take\r\npossession of it.[1] He dispersed his followers to form settlements over\r\nthe island, and having given to his kingdom his patrimonial name of\r\nSihala[2], he addressed himself to render his dominions \"habitable for\r\nmen.\"[3] He treated the subjugated race of Yakkhos with a despotic\r\ndisdain, referable less to pride of caste than to contempt for the rude\r\nhabits of the native tribes. He repudiated the Yakkho princess whom he\r\nhad married, because her unequal rank rendered her unfit to remain the\r\nconsort of a king[4]; and though she had borne him children, he drove\r\nher out before his second marriage with the daughter of an Indian\r\nsovereign, on the ground that the latter would be too timid to bear the\r\npresence of a being so inferior.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: HIOUEN THSANG, ch iv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Whence Singhala (and Singhalese) Silan, Seylan, and\r\nCeylon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. vii p. 49. _Rajaratnacari_, ch. i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Mahawanso_, ch. vii. p. 51.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Ibid., p. 52.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 504.]\r\n\r\nLeaving no issue to inherit the throne, he was succeeded by his\r\nnephew[1], who selected a relation of Gotama Buddha for his queen; and\r\nher brothers having dispersed themselves over the island, increased the\r\nnumber of petty kingdoms, which they were permitted to form in various\r\ndistricts[2], a policy which was freely encouraged by all the early\r\nkings, and which, though it served to accelerate colonisation and to\r\nextend the knowledge of agriculture, led in after years to dissensions,\r\ncivil war, and disaster. It was at this period that Ceylon was resolved\r\ninto the three geographical divisions, which, down to a very late\r\nperiod, are habitually referred to by the native historians. All to the\r\nnorth of the Mahawelli-ganga was comprised in the denomination _Pihiti_,\r\nor the Raja-ratta, from its containing the ancient capital and the\r\nresidence of royalty; south of this was _Rohano_ or _Rahuna_, bounded on\r\nthe east and south by the sea, and by the Mahawelli-ganga and\r\nKalu-ganga, on the north and west; a portion of this division near\r\nTangalle still retains the name of Roona.[3] The third was the\r\n_Maya-ratta_, which lay between the mountains, the two great rivers and\r\nthe sea, having the Dedera-oya to the north, and the Kalu-ganga as its\r\nsouthern limit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: B.C. 504.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. vii. p. 51, ix. p. 57; _Rajavali_, part i.\r\np. 177, 186; and TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, p. 12, 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The district of Rohuna included the mountain zone of\r\nCeylon, and hence probably its name, _rohuno_ meaning the \"act or\r\ninstrument of ascending, as steps or a ladder.\" Adam's Peak was in the\r\nMaya division; but Edrisi, who wrote in the twelfth century, says, that\r\nit was then called \"El Rahoun.\"--_Géographie, &c_. viii, JAUBERT'S\r\n_Transl_. vol. ii. p. 71. _Rahu_ is an ordinary name for it amongst\r\nMahometan writers, and in the _Raja Tarangini_, it is called \"Rohanam,\"\r\nb. iii. 56, 72.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 504.]\r\n\r\nThe patriarchal village system, which from time immemorial has been one\r\nof the characteristics of the Dekkan, and which still prevails\r\nthroughout Ceylon in a modified form, was one of the first institutions\r\norganised by the successors of Wijayo. \"They fixed the boundaries of\r\nevery village throughout Lanka;\"[1] they \"caused the whole island to be\r\ndivided into fields and gardens;\"[2] and so uniformly were the rites of\r\nthese rural municipalities respected in after times, that one of the\r\nSinghalese monarchs, on learning that merit attached to alms given from\r\nthe fruit of the donor's own exertions, undertook to sow a field of\r\nrice, and \"from the portion derived by him as the cultivator's share,\"\r\nto bestow an offering on a \"thero.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It was established by Pandukabhaya, A.D. 437.--_Mahawanso_,\r\nch. x. p. 67, _Rajaratnacari_, ch. i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajaratnacari_, ch. ii., _Rajavali_, b. i. p. 185.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The king was Mahachula, 77 B.C.--_Mahawanso_, ch. xxxiv.]\r\n\r\nFrom the necessity of providing food for their followers, the earliest\r\nattention of the Bengal conquerors was directed to the introduction and\r\nextension of agriculture. A passage in the _Mahawanso_ would seem to\r\nimply, that previous to the landing of Wijayo, rice was imported for\r\nconsumption[1], and upwards of two centuries later the same authority\r\nspecifies \"one hundred and sixty loads of hill-paddi,\"[2] among the\r\npresents which were sent to the island from Bengal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Kuweni distributed to the companions of Wijayo; \"rice and\r\nother articles, _procured from the wrecked ships of mariners_.\"\r\n(_Mahawanso_, ch. vii. p. 49.) A tank is mentioned as then existing near\r\nthe residence of Kuweni; but it was only to be used as a bath. (Ib. c.\r\nvii. p. 48.) The _Rajaratnacari_ also mentions that, in the fabulous age\r\nof the second Buddha, of the present Kalpa, there was a famine in\r\nCeylon, which dried up the cisterns and fountains of the inland. But\r\nthere is no evidence of the existence of systematic tillage anterior to\r\nthe reign of Wijayo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xi. p. 70. _Paddi_ is rice before it has\r\nbeen freed from the husk.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 504.]\r\n\r\nIn a low and level country like the north of Ceylon, where the chief\r\nsubsistence of the people is rice, a grain which can only be\r\nsuccessfully cultivated under water, the first requisites of society are\r\nreservoirs and canals. The Buddhist historians extol the father of\r\nWijayo for his judgment and skill \"in forming villages in situations\r\nfavourable for irrigation;\"[1] his own attention was fully engrossed\r\nwith the cares attendant on the consolidation of his newly acquired\r\npower; but the earliest public work undertaken by his successor\r\nPanduwasa, B.C. 504, was a tank, which he caused to be formed in the\r\nvicinity of his new capital Anarajapoora, the _Anurogrammum_ of Ptolemy,\r\noriginally a village founded by one of the followers of Wijayo.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. vi. p. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The first tank recorded in Ceylon is the Abayaweva, made by\r\nPanduwasa, B.C. 505 (_Mahawanso_, ch. ix. p. 57).

Colonists from the continent of India\r\nwere encouraged by the facilities held out to settlers, and carriage\r\nroads were formed in the vicinity of the towns.[1] Village communities\r\nwere duly organised, gardens were planted, flowers and fruit-bearing\r\ntrees introduced,[2] and the production of food secured by the\r\nconstruction of canals,[3] and public works for irrigation. Moreover,\r\nthe kings and petty princes attested the interest which they felt in the\r\npromotion of agriculture, by giving personal attention to the formation\r\nof tanks and to the labours of cultivation.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xiv. xv. xvi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xi. p. 60 (367 B.C.), ch. xxxiv. p. 211\r\n(B.C. 20), ch. xxxv. p. 215 (A.D. 20). _Rajaratnacari_, ch. ii. p. 29.\r\n_Rajavali_, p. 185, 227.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxiv. p. 210 (B.C. 42), ch. xxxv. p. 221,\r\n222 (A.D. 275), ch. xxxvii. p. 238. _Rajaratnacari_, ch. ii. p. 49, and\r\n_Rajavali_, p. 223, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Mahawanso_, ch. x. p. 61, xxii. p. 130, xxiv. p. 149.\r\n_Rajavali_, p. 185, 186.

Wijayo was, in all probability, a\r\nBrahman, but so indifferent to his own faith, that his first alliance in\r\nCeylon was with a demon worshipper.[1] His immediate successors were so\r\neager to encourage immigration, that they treated all religions with a\r\nperfect equality of royal favour. Yakkho temples were not only\r\nrespected, but \"annual demon offerings were provided\" for them; halls\r\nwere built for the worshippers of Brahma, and residences were provided\r\nat the public cost, for \"five hundred persons of various foreign\r\nreligious faiths;\"[2] but no mention is made in the _Mahawanso_ of a\r\nsingle edifice having been then raised for the worshippers of Buddha,\r\nwhether resident in the island, or arriving amongst the colonists from\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: According to the _Mahawanso_, Vishnu, in order to protect\r\nWijayo and his followers from the sorceries of the Yakkhos, met them on\r\ntheir landing in Ceylon, and \"_tied threads on their arms_,\" ch. vii.;\r\nand at a later period, when the king Panduwasa, B.C. 504, was afflicted\r\nwith temporary insanity, as a punishment in his person of the crime of\r\nperjury, committed by his predecessor Wijayo, _Iswara_ was supplicated\r\nto interpose, and by his mediation the king was restored to his right\r\nmind.--_Rajavali_, p. 181.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. x. p. 67; ch, xxxiii, p. 203.]\r\n\r\nIt was not till the year B.C. 307, in the reign of Tissa, that the\r\npreacher Mahindo ventured to visit Ceylon, under the auspices of the\r\nking, whom he succeeded in inducing to abstain from Brahmanical rites,\r\nand to profess faith in the doctrines of Buddha. From the prominent part\r\nthus taken by Tissa in establishing the national faith of Ceylon, the\r\nsacred writers honour his name with the prefix of _Déwánan-pia_, or\r\n\"beloved of the saints.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 307.]\r\n\r\nThe _Mahawanso_ exhausts the vocabulary of ecstacy in describing the\r\nadvent of Mahindo, a prince of Magadha, and a lineal descendant of\r\nChandragutto. It records the visions by which he was divinely directed\r\nto \"depart on his mission for the conversion of Lanka;\" it describes his\r\naërial flight, and his descent on Ambatthalo, the loftiest peak of\r\nMihintala, the mountain which, rising suddenly from the plain, overlooks\r\nthe sacred city of Anarajapoora. The story proceeds to explain, how the\r\nking, who was hunting the elk, was miraculously allured by the fleeing\r\ngame to approach the spot where Mahindo was seated[1]; and how the\r\nlatter forthwith propounded the Divine doctrine \"to the ruler of the\r\nland; who, at the conclusion of his discourse, together with his forty\r\nthousand followers, obtained the salvation of the faith.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The story, as related in the _Mahawanso_, bears a\r\nresemblance to the legend of St. Hubert and the stag, in the forest of\r\nArdennes, and to that of St. Eustace, who, when hunting, was led by a\r\ndeer of singular beauty towards a rock, where it displayed to him the\r\ncrucifix upon its forehead; whence an appeal was addressed which\r\neffected his conversion. \"The king Dewananpiyatissa departed for an elk\r\nhunt, taking with him a retinue; and in the course of the pursuit of the\r\ngame on foot, he came to the Missa mountain. A certain devo, assuming\r\nthe form of an elk, stationed himself there, grazing; the sovereign\r\ndescried him, and saying 'it is not fair to shoot him standing,' sounded\r\nhis bowstring, on which the elk fled to the mountain. The king gave\r\nchase to the flying animal, and, on reaching the spot where the priests\r\nwere, the thero Mahindo came within sight of the monarch; but the\r\nmetamorphosed deer vanished.\"--_Mahawanso_, c. xiv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xiv. p. 80.]\r\n\r\nThen follows the approach of Mahindo to the capital; the conversion of\r\nthe queen and her attendants, and the reception of Buddhism by the\r\nnation, under the preaching of its great Apostle, who \"thus became the\r\nluminary which shed the light of religion over the land.\" He and his\r\nsister Sanghamitta thenceforth devoted their lives to the organisation\r\nof Buddhist communities throughout Ceylon, and died in the odour of\r\nsanctity, in the reign of King Uttiya, B.C. 267.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 289.]\r\n\r\nBut the grand achievement which consummated the establishment of the\r\nnational faith, was the arrival from Magadha of a branch of the sacred\r\nBo-tree. Every ancient race has had its sacred tree; the Chaldeans, the\r\nHebrews[1], the Greeks, the Romans and the Druids, had each their\r\ngroves, their elms and their oaks, under which to worship. Like them,\r\nthe Brahmans have their _Kalpa tree_ in Paradise, and the Banyan in the\r\nvicinity of their temples; and the Buddhists, in conformity with\r\nimmemorial practice, selected as their sacred tree the Pippul, which is\r\nclosely allied to the Banyan, yet sufficiently distinguished from it, to\r\nserve as the emblem of a new and peculiar worship.[2] It was whilst\r\nreclining under the shade of this tree in Uruwela, that Gotama received\r\nBuddhahood; hence its adoption as an object of reverence by his\r\nfollowers, and in all probability its adoration preceded the use of\r\nimages and temples in Ceylon.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"They sacrifice upon the tops of mountains, and burn\r\nincense under oaks, and poplars, and elms, because the shadow thereof is\r\ngood.\"--_Hosea_, iv. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Bo-tree (_Ficus religiosa_) is the \"pippul\" of India.\r\nIt differs from the Banyan (_F. indica_), by sending down no roots from\r\nits branches. Its heart-shaped leaves, with long attenuated points, are\r\nattached to the stem by so slender a stalk, that they appear in the\r\nprofoundest calm to be ever in motion, and thus, like the leaves of the\r\naspen, which, from the tradition that the cross was made of that wood,\r\nthe Syrians believe to tremble in recollection of the events of the\r\ncrucifixion, those of the Bo-tree are supposed by the Buddhists to\r\nexhibit a tremulous veneration, associated with the sacred scene of\r\nwhich they were the witnesses.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Previous Buddhas had each his Bo-tree or Buddha-tree. The\r\npippul had been before assumed by the first recorded Buddha; others had\r\nthe iron-tree, the champac, the nipa, &c.--_Mahawanso_, TURNOUR'S\r\nIntrod. p. xxxii.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 289.]\r\n\r\nIn order that his kingdom might possess a sacred tree of the supremest\r\nsanctity, king Tissa solicited a branch of the identical tree under\r\nwhich Gotama reclined, from Asoca, who then reigned in Magadha. The\r\ndifficulty of severing a portion without the sacrilegious offence of\r\n\"lopping it with any weapon,\" was overcome by the miracle of the branch\r\ndetaching itself spontaneously, and descending with its roots into the\r\nfragrant earth prepared for it in a golden vase, in which it was\r\ntransported by sea to Ceylon[1], and planted by king Tissa in the spot\r\nat Anarajapoora, where, after the lapse of more than 2000 years, it\r\nstill continues to flourish and to receive the profound veneration of\r\nall Buddhist nations.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The ceremonial of the mysterious severance of the sacred\r\nbranch \"amid the din of music, the clamours of men, the howling of the\r\nelements, the roar of animals, the screams of birds, the yells of\r\ndemons, and the crash of earthquakes,\" is minutely described in an\r\nelaborate passage of the _Mahawanso_. And its landing in Ceylon, the\r\nretinue of its attendants, the homage paid to it, its progress to the\r\ncapital, its arrival at the Northern-gate \"at the hour when shadows are\r\nmost extended,\" its reception by princes \"adorned with the insignia of\r\nroyalty,\" and its final deposition in the earth, under the auspices of\r\nMahindo and his sister Sanghamitta, form one of the most striking\r\nepisodes in that very singular book.--_Mahawanso_, ch. xviii. xix.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The planting of the Bo-tree took place in the eighteenth\r\nyear of the reign of King Devenipiatissa, B.C. 288; it is consequently\r\nat the present time 2147 years old.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BO TREE AT ANARAJAPOORA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY BUDDHIST MONUMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 289.]\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with the establishment of the Buddhist religion\r\nwas commenced the erection of those stupendous ecclesiastical\r\nstructures, the number and magnitude of whose remains form a remarkable\r\ncharacteristic in the present aspect of the country.\r\n\r\nThe architectural history of continental India dates from the third\r\ncentury before Christ; not a single building or sculptured stone having\r\nas yet been discovered there, of an age anterior to the reign of\r\nAsoca[1], who was the first of his dynasty to abandon the religion of\r\nBrahma for that of Buddha. In like manner the earliest existing\r\nmonuments of Ceylon belong to the same period; they owe their\r\nconstruction to Devenipiatissa, and the historical annals of the island\r\nrecord with pious gratitude the series of dagobas, wiharas, and temples\r\nerected by him and his successors.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: FERGUSON, _Handbook of Architecture_, b. i. c. i. p. 5.]\r\n\r\nOf these the most remarkable are the Dagobas, piles of brickwork of\r\ndimensions so extraordinary that they suggest comparison with the\r\npyramids of Memphis[1], the barrow of Halyattys[2], or the mounds in the\r\nvalleys of the Tigris and Euphrates.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: So vast did the dagobas appear to the Singhalese that the\r\nauthor of the _Mahawanso_, in describing the construction of that called\r\nthe _Ruanwelle_ at Anarajapoora, states that each of the lower courses\r\ncontained ten kotis (a koti being equal to 100 lacs) or 10,000,000\r\nbricks.--_Mahawanso_, ch. xxx, p. 179.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"The ancient edifices of Chi-Chen in Central America bear a\r\nstriking resemblance to the topes of India. The shape of one of the\r\ndomes, its apparent size, the small tower on the summit, the trees\r\ngrowing on the sides, the appearance of masonry here and there, the\r\nshape of the ornaments, and the small doorway at the base, are so\r\nexactly similar to what I had seen at Anarajapoora that when my eyes\r\nfirst fell on the engravings of these remarkable ruins I supposed that\r\nthey were presented in illustration of the dagobas of Ceylon.\"--HARDY's\r\n_Eastern Monachism_, c. xix. p. 222.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 289.]\r\n\r\nA dagoba (from _datu_, a relic, and _gabbhan_, a shrine[1]) is a\r\nmonument raised to preserve one of the relics of Gotama, which were\r\ncollected after the cremation of his body at Kusinara, and it is\r\ncandidly admitted in the _Mahawanso_ that the intention in erecting them\r\nwas to provide \"objects to which offerings could be made.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Deha_, \"the body,\" and _gopa_, \"what preserves;\" because\r\nthey enshrine hair, teeth, nails, &c. of Buddha.--WILSON'S _Asiat. Res._\r\nvol. xvii. p. 605.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xvii. p. 104.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SMALL DAGOBA AT KANDY]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 289.]\r\n\r\nCeylon contains but one class of these structures, and boasts no tall\r\nmonolithic pillars like the _lats_ of Delhi and Allahabad, and no\r\nregularly built columns similar to the _minars_ of Cabul; but the\r\nfragments of the bones of Gotama, and locks of his hair, are enclosed in\r\nenormous masses of hemispherical masonry, modifications of which may be\r\ntraced in every Buddhist country of Asia, in the topes of Affghanistan\r\nand the Punjaub, in the pagodas of Pegu, and in the Boro-Buddor of Java.\r\nThose of Ceylon consist of a bell-shaped dome of brick-work surmounted\r\nby a terminal or _tee_ (generally in the form of a cube supporting a\r\npointed spire), and resting on a square platform approached by flights\r\nof stone steps. Those, the ruins of which have been explored in modern\r\ntimes, have been found to be almost solid, enclosing a hollow vessel of\r\nmetal or stone which had once contained the relic, but of which the\r\nornament alone and a few gems or discoloured pearls set in gold, are\r\nusually all that is now discoverable.\r\n\r\nTheir outline exhibits but little of ingenuity or of art, and their\r\nconstruction is only remarkable for the vast amount of labour which must\r\nnecessarily have been expended upon them. But, independently of this,\r\nthe first dagoba erected at Anarajapoora, the Thuparamaya, which exists\r\nto the present day, \"as nearly as may be in the same form in which it\r\nwas originally designed, is possessed of a peculiar interest from the\r\nfact that it is in all probability the oldest architectural monument now\r\nextant in India.\"[1] It was raised by King Tissa, at the close of the\r\nthird century before Christ, over the collar-bone of Buddha, which\r\nMahindo had procured for the king.[2] In dimensions this monument is\r\ninferior to those built at a later period by the successors of Tissa,\r\nsome of which are scarcely exceeded in diameter and altitude by the dome\r\nof St. Peter's[3]; but in elegance of outline it immeasurably surpassed\r\nall the other dagobas, and the beauty of its design is still perceptible\r\nin its ruins after the lapse of two thousand years.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: FERGUSON'S _Handbook of Architecture_, b. i. c. iii. p.\r\n43.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xvii. _The Rajavali_ calls it the\r\njaw-bone, p. 184.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The Abhayagiri dagoba at Anarajapoora, built B.C. 89, was\r\noriginally 180 cubits high, which, taking the Ceylon cubit at 2 feet 3\r\ninches, would be equal to 405 feet. The dome was hemispherical, and\r\ndescribed with a radius of 180 feet, giving a circumference of 1130\r\nfeet. The summit of this stupendous work was therefore fifty feet higher\r\nthan St. Paul's, and fifty feet lower than St. Peter's.]\r\n\r\nThe king, in addition to this, built a number of others in various parts\r\nof Ceylon[1], and his name has been perpetuated as the founder of\r\ntemples, for the rites of the new religion, and of Wiharas or\r\nmonasteries for the residence of its priesthood. The former were of the\r\nsimplest design, for an atheistical system, which substitutes meditation\r\nfor worship, dispenses with splendour in its edifices and pomp in its\r\nceremonial.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, p. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 289.]\r\n\r\nThe images of Grotama, which in time became objects of veneration, were\r\nbut a late innovation[1], and a doubt even been expressed whether the\r\nreligion of Buddha in its primitive constitution, rejecting as it does\r\nthe doctrine of a mediatorial priesthood, contemplated the existence of\r\nany organised ministry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The precise date of their introduction is unknown, but the\r\nfirst mention of a statue occurs in an inscription on the rock at\r\nMihintala, bearing date A.D. 246, and referring to the house constructed\r\nover a figure of Buddha.]\r\n\r\nCaves, or insulated apartments in imitation of their gloom and\r\nretirement, were in all probability the first resort of devotees in\r\nCeylon, and hence amongst the deeds of King Tissa, the most conspicuous\r\nand munificent were the construction of rock temples, on Mihintala, and\r\nof apartments for the priests in all parts of his dominions.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: TURNOUR's _Epitome_, p. 15.]\r\n\r\nThe directions of Gotama as to the residence of his votaries are\r\ncharacterised by the severest simplicity, and the term \"pansala,\"\r\nliterally \"a dwelling of leaves,\"[1] by which the house of a priest is\r\ndescribed to the present day, serves to illustrate the original\r\nintention that persons dedicated to his service should cultivate\r\nsolitude and meditation by withdrawing into the forest, but within such\r\na convenient distance as would not estrange them from the villagers, on\r\nwhose bounty and alms they were to be dependent for subsistence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is questionable whether the Sarmanai, mentioned by\r\nMegasthenes, were Buddhists or Brahmans; but the account which he gives\r\nof the class of them whom he styles the Hylobii, would seem to identify\r\nthem with the Sramanas of Buddhism, \"passing their lives in the woods,\r\n[Greek: zôntes en tais ulais], living on fruits and seeds, and clothed\r\nwith the bark of trees.\"--MEGASTHENES' _Indica_, &c., Fragm. xlii.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 289.]\r\n\r\nIn one of the rock inscriptions deciphered by Prinsep, King Asoca, in\r\naddressing himself to his Buddhist subjects, distinguishes them as\r\n\"ascetics and _house-holders_.\" In the sacred books a laic is called a\r\n\"graha pali,\" meaning \"the ruler of a house;\" and in contra-distinction\r\nFa Hian, the Chinese Buddhist, speaks of the priests of Ceylon under the\r\ndesignation of \"the house-less,\" to mark their abandonment of social\r\nenjoyments.[1] Anticipating the probable necessity of their eventually\r\nresorting to houses for accommodation, Buddha directed that, if built\r\nfor an individual, the internal measurement of a cell should be twelve\r\nspans in length by seven in breadth[2]; and, if restricted to such\r\ndimensions, the assertions of the Singhalese chronicles become\r\nintelligible as to the prodigious number of such dwellings said to have\r\nbeen raised by the early kings.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Les hommes hors de leur maisons.\"--FA HIAN, _Fo[)e]\r\nKou[)e] Ki_, ch. xxxix. This is the equivalent of the Singhalese term\r\nfor the same class, _agariyan-pubbajito_, used in the Pittakas.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: HARDY'S _Eastern Monachism_, ch. xiii. p. 122.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The _Rajaratnacari_ says that Devenipiatissa caused\r\n_eighty-four thousand_ temples to be built during his reign, p. 35.]\r\n\r\nBut the multitudes who were thus attracted to a life of indolent\r\ndevotion became in a short time so excessive that recourse was had to\r\nother devices for combining economy with accommodation, and groups of\r\nsuch cells were gradually formed into wiharas and monasteries, the\r\ninmates of which have uniformly preserved their organisation and order.\r\nStill the edifices thus constructed have never exhibited any tendency to\r\ndepart from the primitive simplicity so strongly enjoined by their\r\nfounder; and, down to the present time, the homes of the Buddhist\r\npriesthood are modest and humble structures generally reared of mud and\r\nthatch, with no pretension to external beauty and no attempt at internal\r\ndecoration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 289.]\r\n\r\nTo supply to the ascetics the means of seclusion and exercise, the early\r\nkings commenced the erection of ambulance-halls; and gardens were set\r\napart for the use of the great temple communities. The _Mahawanso_\r\ndescribes, with all the pomp of Oriental diction, the ceremony observed\r\nby King Tissa on the occasion of setting apart a portion of ground as a\r\nsite for the first wihara at his capital; the monarch in person,\r\nattended by standard bearers and guards with golden staves, having come\r\nto mark out the boundary with a plough drawn by elephants.[1] A second\r\nmonastery was erected by him on the summit of Mihintala[2]; a third was\r\nattached to the dagoba of the Thuparamaya, and others were rapidly\r\nfounded in every quarter of the island.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xv. p. 99.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xx. p. 123.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Five hundred were built by one king alone, the third in\r\nsuccession from Devenipiatissa, B.C. 246 (_Mahawanso_, ch. xxi, p. 127).\r\nAbout the same period the petty chiefs of Rohuna and Mahagam were\r\nequally zealous in their devout labours, the one having erected\r\nsixty-four wiharas in the east of the island, and the other sixty-eight\r\nin the south.--_Mahawanso_, ch. xxiv. p. 145, 148.]\r\n\r\nIt was in all probability owing to the growth of these institutions, and\r\nthe establishment of colleges in connection with them, that halls were\r\neventually appropriated for the reception of statues; and that\r\napartments so consecrated were devoted to the ceremonies and worship of\r\nBuddha. Hence, at a very early period, the dwellings of the priests were\r\nidentified with the chaityas and sacred edifices, and the name of the\r\nWihara came to designate indifferently both the temple and the\r\nmonastery.\r\n\r\nBut the hall which contains the figures of Buddha, and which constitutes\r\nthe \"temple\" proper, is always detached from the domestic buildings, and\r\nis frequently placed on an eminence from which the view is commanding.\r\nThe interior is painted in the style of Egyptian chambers, and is filled\r\nwith figures and illustrations of the legends of Gotama, whose statue,\r\nwith hand uplifted in the attitude of admonition, or reclining in repose\r\nemblematic of the blissful state of Nirwana, is placed in the dimmest\r\nrecess of the edifice. Here lamps cast a feeble light, and the air is\r\nheavy with the perfume of flowers, which are daily renewed by fresh\r\nofferings from the worshippers at the shrines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 289.]\r\n\r\nIn no other system of idolatry, ancient or modern, have the rites been\r\nadministered by such a multitude of priests as assist in the passionless\r\nceremonial of Buddhism. Fa Hian, in the fourth century, was assured by\r\nthe people of Ceylon that at that period the priests numbered between\r\nfifty and sixty thousand, of whom two thousand were attached to one\r\nwihara at Anarajapoora, and three thousand to another.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: FA HIAN, _Fo[)e] Kou[)e] Ki_, ch. xxxviii. p. 336, 350. At\r\nthe present day the number in the whole island does not probably exceed\r\n2500 (HARDY'S _Eastern Monachism_, p. 57, 309). But this is far below\r\nthe proportion of the Buddhist priesthood in other countries; in Siam\r\nnearly every adult male becomes a priest for a certain portion of his\r\nlife; a similar practice prevails in Ava; and in Burmah so common is it\r\nto assume the yellow robe, that the popular expedient for effecting\r\ndivorce is for the parties to make a profession of the priesthood, the\r\nceremonial of which is sufficient to dissolve the marriage vow, and\r\nafter an interval of a few months, they can throw off the yellow robe\r\nand are then at liberty to marry again.]\r\n\r\nAs the vow which devotes the priests of Buddha to religion binds them at\r\nthe same time to a life of poverty and mendicancy, the extension of the\r\nfaith entailed in great part on the crown the duty of supporting the\r\nvast crowds who withdrew themselves from industry to embrace devotion\r\nand indigence. They were provided with food by the royal bounty, and\r\nhence the historical books make perpetual reference to the priests\r\n\"going to the king's house to eat,\"[1] when the monarch himself set the\r\nexample to his subjects of \"serving them with rice broth, cakes, and\r\ndressed rice.\"[2] Rice in all its varieties is the diet described in the\r\n_Mahawanso_ as being provided for the priesthood by the munificence of\r\nthe kings; \"rice prepared with sugar and honey, rice with clarified\r\nbutter, and rice in its ordinary form.\"[3] In addition to the enjoyment\r\nof a life of idleness, another powerful incentive conspired to swell the\r\nnumbers of these devotees. The followers and successors of Wijayo\r\npreserved intact the institution of caste, which they had brought with\r\nthem from the valley of the Ganges; and, although caste was not\r\nabolished by the teachers of Buddhism, who retained and respected it as\r\na social institution, it was practically annulled and absorbed in the\r\nreligious character;--all who embraced the ascetic life being\r\nsimultaneously absolved from all conventional disabilities, and received\r\nas members of the sacred community with all its exalted prerogatives.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajavali_, p. 198. Hiouen Thsang, the Chinese pilgrim,\r\ndescribing Anarajapoora in the seventh century, says: \"A côté du palais\r\ndu roi; on a construit une vaste cuisine où l'on prépare chaque jour des\r\naliments pour dix-huit mille religieux. A l'heure de repas, les\r\nreligieux viennent, un pot à la main, pour recevoir leur nourriture.\r\nAprès l'avoir obtenue ils s'en retournent chacun dans leur\r\nchambre.\"--HIOUEN THSANG, _Transl._ M.

And in conformity with\r\nthis precedent the robes of every priest are similarly dissected and\r\nreunited.--Hardy's _Eastern Monachism_, c. xii. p. 117; _Rajaratnacari_,\r\nch. ii. pp. 60, 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajaratnacari_, pp. 104, 109, 112. The custom which is\r\nstill observed in Ceylon, of weaving robes between sunrise and sunset is\r\ncalled _Catina dhwana_ (_Rajavali_, p. 261). The work is performed\r\nchiefly by women, and the practice is identical with that mentioned by\r\nHerodotus, as observed by the priests of Egypt, who celebrated a\r\nfestival in honour of the return of Rhampsinitus, after playing at dice\r\nwith Ceres in Ilades, by investing one of their body with a cloak made\r\nin a single day, [Greek: pharos autêmeron exyphênantes], _Euterpe_,\r\ncxxii.

The cousins of the king, three of whom ascended the throne\r\nin succession, seem to have vied with each other in works of piety and\r\nutility. Wiharas were built in all parts of the island, both north and\r\nsouth of the Maha-welli-ganga. Dagobas were raised in various places,\r\nand cultivation was urged forward by the formation of tanks and canals.\r\nBut, during this period, from the fact of the Bengal immigrants being\r\nemployed in more congenial or more profitable occupations (possibly also\r\nfrom the numbers who were annually devoting themselves to the service of\r\nthe temples), and from the ascertained inaptitude of the native\r\nSinghalese to bear arms, a practice was commenced of retaining foreign\r\nmercenaries, which, even at that early period, was productive of\r\nanimosity and bloodshed, and in process of time led to the overthrow of\r\nthe Wijayan dynasty and the gradual decay of the Sinhala sovereignty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 266.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 237.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 205.]\r\n\r\nThe genius of the Gangetic race, which had taken possession of Ceylon,\r\nwas essentially adapted to agricultural pursuits--in which, to the\r\npresent day, their superiority is apparent over the less energetic\r\ntribes of the Dekkan. Busied with such employments, the early colonists\r\nhad no leisure for military service; besides, whilst Devenipiatissa and\r\nhis successors were earnestly engaged in the formation of religious\r\ncommunities, and the erection of sacred edifices in the northern portion\r\nof the island, various princes of the same family occupied themselves in\r\nforming settlements in the south and west; and hence, whilst their\r\npeople were zealously devoted to the service and furtherance of\r\nreligion, the sovereign at Anarajapoora was compelled, through a\r\ncombination of causes, to take into his pay a body of Malabars[1] for\r\nthe protection both of the coast and the interior. Of the foreigners\r\nthus confided in, \"two youths, powerful in their cavalry and navy, named\r\nSena and Gottika,\"[2] proved unfaithful to their trust, and after\r\ncausing the death of the king Suratissa (B.C. 237), retained the supreme\r\npower for upwards of twenty years, till overthrown in their turn and put\r\nto death by the adherents of the legitimate line.[3] Ten years, however,\r\nhad barely elapsed when the attempt to establish a Tamil sovereign was\r\nrenewed by Elala, \"a Malabar of the illustrious Uju tribe, who invaded\r\nthe island from the Chola[4] country, killed the reigning king Asela,\r\nand ruled the kingdom for forty years, administering justice impartially\r\nto friends and foes.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The term \"Malabar\" is used throughout the following pages\r\nin the comprehensive sense in which it is applied in the Singhalese\r\nchronicles to the continental invaders of Ceylon; but it must be\r\nobserved that the adventurers in these expeditions, who are styled in\r\nthe _Mahawanso, \"damilos\"_ or Tamils, came not only from the\r\nsouth-western tract of the Dekkan, known in modern geography as\r\n\"Malabar,\" but also from all parts of the peninsula, as far north as\r\nCuttack and Orissa.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxi. p. 127.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, xxi.; _Rajaratnacari_, ch. ii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Chola, or Solee, was the ancient name of Tanjore, and the\r\ncountry traversed by the river Caveri.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 161.]\r\n\r\nSuch is the encomium which the _Mahawanso_ passes on an infidel usurper,\r\nbecause Elala offered his protection to the priesthood; but the orthodox\r\nannalist closes his notice of his reign by the moral reflection that\r\n\"even he who was an heretic, and doomed by his creed to perdition,\r\nobtained an exalted extent of supernatural power from having eschewed\r\nimpiety and injustice.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, xxi. p. 129. The other historical books, the\r\n_Rajavali_, and _Rajaratnacari_, give a totally different character of\r\nElala, and represent him as the desecrator of monuments and the\r\noverthrower of temples. The traditional estimation which has followed\r\nhis memory is the best attestation of the superior accuracy of the\r\n_Mahawanso_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 161.]\r\n\r\nBut it was not the priests alone who were captivated by the generosity\r\nof Elala. In the final struggle for the throne, in which the Malabars\r\nwere worsted by the gallantry of Dutugaimunu, a prince of the excluded\r\nfamily, the deeds of bravery displayed by him were the admiration of his\r\nenemies. The contest between the rival chiefs is the solitary tale of\r\nCeylon chivalry, in which Elala is the Saladin and Dutugaimunu the\r\nCoeur-de-lion. So genuine was the admiration of Elala's bravery that his\r\nrival erected a monument in his honour, on the spot where he fell; its\r\nruins remain to the present day, and the Singhalese still regard it with\r\nrespect and veneration. \"On reaching the quarter of the city in which it\r\nstands,\" says the _Mahawanso_[1], \"it has been the custom for the\r\nmonarchs of Lanka to silence their music, whatsoever cession they may be\r\nheading;\" and so uniformly was the homage continued down to the most\r\nrecent period, that so lately as 1818, on the suppression of an\r\nattempted rebellion, when the defeated aspirant to the throne was making\r\nhis escape by Anarajapoora, he alighted from his litter, on approaching\r\nthe quarter in which the monument was known to exist, \"and although\r\nweary and almost incapable of exertion, not knowing the precise spot, he\r\ncontinued on foot till assured that he had passed far beyond the ancient\r\nmemorial.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: FORBES' _Eleven Years in Ceylon_, vol. i. p. 233.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 161.]\r\n\r\nDutugaimunu, in the epics of Buddhism, enjoys a renown, second only to\r\nthat of King Tissa, as the champion of the faith. On the recovery of his\r\nkingdom he addressed himself with energy to remove the effects produced\r\nin the northern portions of the island by forty years of neglect and\r\ninaction under the sway of Elala. During that monarch's protracted\r\nusurpation the minor sovereignties, which had been formed in various\r\nparts of the island prior to his seizure of the crown, were little\r\nimpeded in their social progress by the forty-four years' residence of\r\nthe Malabars at Anarajapoora. Although the petty kings of Rohuna and\r\nMaya submitted to pay tribute to Elala, his personal rule did not extend\r\nsouth of the Mahawelli-ganga[1], and whilst the strangers in the north\r\nof the island were plundering the temples of Buddha, the feudal chiefs\r\nin the south and west were emulating the munificence of Tissa in the\r\nnumber of wiharas which they constructed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxii., _Rajavali_, p. 188,\r\n_Rajaratnacari_, p. 36. The _Mahawanso_ has a story of Dutugaimunu, when\r\na boy, illustrative of his early impatience to rid the island of the\r\nMalabars. His father seeing him lying on his bed, with his hands and\r\nfeet gathered up, inquired, \"My boy, why not stretch thyself at length\r\non thy bed?\" \"Confined by the Damilos,\" he replied, \"beyond the river on\r\nthe one side, and by the unyielding ocean on the other, how can I lie\r\nwith outstretched limbs?\"]\r\n\r\nEager to conciliate his subjects by a similar display of regard for\r\nreligion, Dutugaimunu signalised his victory and restoration by\r\ncommencing the erection of the Ruanwellé dagoba, the most stupendous as\r\nwell as the most venerated of those at Anarajapoora, as it enclosed a\r\nmore imposing assemblage of relics than were ever enshrined in any other\r\nin Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe mass of the population was liable to render compulsory labour to the\r\ncrown; but wisely reflecting that it was not only derogatory to the\r\nsacredness of the object, but impolitic to exact any avoidable\r\nsacrifices from a people so recently suffering from internal warfare,\r\nDutugaimunu came to the resolution of employing hired workmen only, and\r\naccording to the _Mahawanso_ vast numbers of the Yakkhos became converts\r\nto Buddhism during the progress of the building[1], which the king did\r\nnot live to complete.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxviii. xxix. xxx. xxxi.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 161.]\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable of the edifices which he erected at the capital\r\nwas the Maha-Lowa-paya, a monastery which obtained the name of the\r\n_Brazen Palace_ from the fact of its being roofed with plates of that\r\nmetal. It was elevated on sixteen hundred monolithic columns of granite\r\ntwelve feet high, and arranged in lines of forty, so as to cover an area\r\nof upwards of two hundred and twenty feet square. On these rested the\r\nbuilding nine stories in height, which, in addition to a thousand\r\ndormitories for priests, contained halls and other apartments for their\r\nexercise and accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe _Mahawanso_ relates with peculiar unction the munificence of\r\nDutugaimunu in remunerating those employed upon this edifice; he\r\ndeposited clothing for that purpose as well as \"vessels filled with\r\nsugar, buffalo butter and honey;\" he announced that on this occasion it\r\nwas not fitting to exact unpaid labour, and, \"placing high value on the\r\nwork to be performed, he paid the workmen with money.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxvii. p. 163.]\r\n\r\nThe structure, when completed, far exceeded in splendour anything\r\nrecorded in the sacred books. All its apartments were embellished with\r\n\"beads, resplendent like gems;\" the great hall was supported by golden\r\npillars resting on lions and other animals, and the walls were\r\nornamented with festoons of pearls and of flowers formed of jewels; in\r\nthe centre was an ivory throne, with an emblem on one side of a golden\r\nsun, and on the other of the moon in silver, and above all glittered the\r\nimperial \"chatta,\" the white canopy of dominion. The palace, says the\r\n_Mahawanso_, was provided with rich carpets and couches, and \"even the\r\nladle of the rice boiler was of gold.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 161.]\r\n\r\nThe vicissitudes and transformations of the Brazen Palace are subjects\r\nof frequent mention in the history of the sacred city. As originally\r\nplanned by Dutugaimunu, it did not endure through the reign of his\r\nsuccessor Saidaitissa, at whose expense it was reconstructed, B.C. 140,\r\nbut the number of stories was lowered to seven.[1] More than two\r\ncenturies later, A.D. 182, these were again reduced to five[2], and the\r\nentire building must have been taken down in A.D. 240, as the king who\r\nwas then reigning caused \"the pillars of the Lowa Pasado to be arranged\r\nin a different form.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxvi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxiii.]\r\n\r\nThe edifice erected on its site was pulled to the ground by the apostate\r\nMaha Sen, A.D. 301[1]; but penitently reconstructed by him on his\r\nrecantation of his errors. Its last recorded restoration took place in\r\nthe reign of Prakrama-bahu, towards the close of the twelfth century,\r\nwhen \"the king rebuilt the Lowa-Maha-paya, and raised up the 1600\r\npillars of rock.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxvii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUINS OF THE BRAZEN PALACE]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 161.]\r\n\r\nThus exposed to spoliation by its splendour, and obnoxious to infidel\r\ninvaders from the religious uses to which it was dedicated, it was\r\nsubjected to violence on every commotion, whether civil or external,\r\nwhich disturbed the repose of the capital; and at the present day, no\r\ntraces of it remain except the indestructible monoliths on which it\r\nstood. A \"world of stone columns,\" to use the quaint expression of Knox,\r\nstill marks the site of the Brazen Palace of Dutugaimunu, and attests\r\nthe accuracy of the chronicles which describe its former magnificence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 137.]\r\n\r\nThe character of Dutugaimunu is succinctly expressed in his dying\r\navowal, that he had lived \"a slave to the priesthood.\"[1] Before\r\npartaking of food, it was his practice to present a portion for their\r\nuse; and recollecting in maturer age, that on one occasion, when a\r\nchild, he had so far forgotten this invariable rule, as _to eat a\r\nchilly_ without sharing it with the priest, he submitted himself to a\r\npenance in expiation of this youthful impiety.[2] His death scene, as\r\ndescribed in the _Mahawanso_, contains an enumeration of the deeds of\r\npiety by which his reign had been signalised.[3] Extended on his couch\r\nin front of the great dagoba which he had erected, he thus addressed one\r\nof his military companions who had embraced the priesthood: \"In times\r\npast, supported by my ten warriors, I engaged in battles; now,\r\nsingle-handed, I commence my last conflict, with death; and it is not\r\npermitted to me to overcome my antagonist.\" \"Ruler of men,\" replied the\r\nthero, \"without subduing the dominion of sin, the power of death is\r\ninvincible; but call to recollection thy acts of piety performed, and\r\nfrom these you will derive consolation.\" The secretary then \"read from\r\nthe register of deeds of piety,\" that \"one hundred wiharas, less one,\r\nhad been constructed by the Maharaja, that he had built two great\r\ndagobas and the Brazen Palace at Anarajapoora; that in famines he had\r\ngiven his jewels to support the pious; that on three several occasions\r\nhe had clothed the whole priesthood throughout the island, giving three\r\ngarments to each; that five times he had conferred the sovereignty of\r\nthe land for the space of seven days on the National Church; that he had\r\nfounded hospitals for the infirm, and distributed rice to the indigent;\r\nbestowed lamps on innumerable temples, and maintained preachers, in the\r\nvarious wiharas, in all parts of his dominions. 'All these acts,' said\r\nthe dying king, 'done in my days of prosperity, afford no comfort to my\r\nmind; but two offerings which I made when in affliction and in\r\nadversity, disregardful of my own fate, are those which alone administer\r\nsolace to me now.[4] After this, the pre-eminently wise Maharaja\r\nexpired, stretched on his bed, in the act of gazing on the Mahatupo.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxiv, xxv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Another name for the Ruanwellé dagoba, which he had built.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF BUDDHISM ON CIVILISATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 137.]\r\n\r\nAfter the reign of Dutugaimunu there is little in the pages of the\r\nnative historians to sustain interest in the story of the Singhalese\r\nmonarchs. The long line of sovereigns is divided into two distinct\r\nclasses; the kings of the _Maha-wanse_ or \"superior dynasty\" of the\r\nuncontaminated blood of Wijayo, who occupied the throne from his death,\r\nB.C. 505, to that of Maha Sen, A.D. 302;--and the _Sulu-wanse_ or\r\n\"inferior race,\" whose descent was less pure, but who, amidst invasions,\r\nrevolutions, and decline, continued, with unsteady hand, to hold the\r\ngovernment clown to the occupation of the island by Europeans in the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 137.]\r\n\r\nTo the great dynasty, and more especially to its earliest members, the\r\ninhabitants were indebted for the first rudiments of civilisation, for\r\nthe arts of agricultural life, for an organised government, and for a\r\nsystem of national worship. But neither the piety of the kings nor their\r\nmunificence sufficed to conciliate the personal attachment of their\r\nsubjects, or to strengthen their throne by national attachment such as\r\nwould have fortified its occupant against the fatalities incident to\r\ndespotism. Of fifty-one sovereigns who formed the pure Wijayan dynasty,\r\ntwo were deposed by their subjects, and nineteen put to death by their\r\nsuccessors.[1] Excepting the rare instances in which a reign was marked\r\nby some occurrence, such as an invasion and repulse of the Malabars,\r\nthere is hardly a sovereign of the \"Solar race\" whose name is associated\r\nwith a higher achievement than the erection of a dagoba or the formation\r\nof a tank, nor one whose story is enlivened by an event more exciting\r\nthan the murder through which he mounted the throne or the conspiracy by\r\nwhich he was driven from it.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There is something very striking in the facility with which\r\naspirants to the throne obtained the instant acquiescence of the people,\r\nso soon as assassination had put them in possession of power. And this\r\nis the more remarkable, where the usurpers were of the lower grade, as\r\nin the instance of Subho, a gate porter, who murdered King Yasa Silo,\r\nA.D. 60, and reigned for six years (_Mahaw._ ch. xxxv. p. 218). A\r\ncarpenter, and a carrier of fire-wood, were each accepted in succession\r\nas sovereigns, A.D. 47; whilst the \"_great dynasty_\" was still in the\r\nplenitude of its popularity. The mystery is perhaps referable to the\r\ndominant necessity of securing tranquillity at any cost, in the state of\r\nsociety where the means of cultivation were directly dependent on the\r\nvillage organisation, and famine and desolation would have been the\r\ninstant and inevitable consequences of any commotions which interfered\r\nwith the conservancy and repair of the tanks and means of irrigation,\r\nand the prompt application of labour to the raising and saving of\r\nproduce at the instant when the fall of the rains or the ripening of the\r\ncrops demanded its employment with the utmost vigour.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In theory the Singhalese monarchy was elective in the\r\ndescendants of the Solar race: in practice, primogeniture had a\r\npreference, and the crown was either hereditary or became the prize of\r\nthose who claimed to be of royal lineage. On reviewing the succession of\r\nkings from B.C. 307 to A.D. 1815, _thirty-nine_ eldest sons (or nearly\r\none fourth), succeeded to their fathers: and _twenty-nine_ kings (or\r\nmore than one fifth), were succeeded by brothers. _Fifteen_ reigned for\r\na period less than one year, and thirty for more than one year, and less\r\nthan four. Of the Singhalese kings who died by violence, twenty-two were\r\nmurdered by their successors; six were killed by other individuals;\r\nthirteen fell in feuds and war, and four committed suicide; eleven were\r\ndethroned, and their subsequent fate is unknown. Not more than\r\ntwo-thirds of the Singhalese kings retained sovereign authority to their\r\ndecease, or reached the funeral pile without a violent death.--FORBES'\r\n_Eleven Years in Ceylon_, vol. i. ch. iv. p. 80, 97; JOINVILLE,\r\n_Religion and Manners of the People of Ceylon; Asiat. Res._ vol. vii. p.\r\n423. See also _Mahawanso_, ch. xxiii. p. 201.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 119.]\r\n\r\nOne source of royal contention arose on the death of Dutugaimunu; his\r\nson, having forfeited his birthright by an alliance with a wife of lower\r\ncaste, was set aside from the succession; Saidaitissa, a brother of the\r\ndeceased king, being raised to the throne in his stead. The priests, on\r\nthe death of Saidaitissa, B.C. 119, hastened to proclaim his youngest\r\nson Thullatthanako[1], to the prejudice of his elder brother\r\nLaiminitissa, but the latter established his just claim by the sword,\r\nand hence arose two rival lines, which for centuries afterwards were\r\nprompt on every opportunity to advance adverse pretensions to the\r\nthrone, and assert them by force of arms.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxiii. p. 201.]\r\n\r\nIn such contests the priesthood brought a preponderant influence to\r\nwhatever side they inclined [1]; and thus the royal authority, though\r\nnot strictly sacerdotal, became so closely identified with the\r\nhierarchy, and so guided by its will, that each sovereign's attention\r\nwas chiefly devoted to forwarding such measures as most conduced to the\r\nexaltation of Buddhism and the maintenance of its monasteries and\r\ntemples.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It was the dying boast of Dutugaimunu that he had lived \"a\r\nslave to the priesthood.\" The expression was figurative in his case; but\r\nso abject did the subserviency of the kings become, and so rapid was its\r\ngrowth, that Bhatiya Tissa, who reigned A.D. 8, rendered it literal, and\r\n\"dedicated himself, his queen, and two sons, as well as his charger, and\r\nstate elephant, as _slaves to the priesthood_.\" The _Mahawanso_\r\nintimates that the priests themselves protested against this debasement,\r\nch. xxxiv. p. 214.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 119.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 104.]\r\n\r\nA signal effect of this regal policy, and of the growing diffusion of\r\nBuddhism, is to be traced in the impulse which it communicated to the\r\nreclamation of lands and the extension of cultivation. For more than\r\nthree hundred years no mention is made in the Singhalese annals of any\r\nmode of maintaining the priesthood other than the royal distribution of\r\nclothing and voluntary offerings of food. They resorted for the \"royal\r\nalms\" either to the residence of the authorities or to halls specially\r\nbuilt for their accommodation [1], to which they were summoned by \"the\r\nshout of refection;\" [2] the ordinary priests receiving rice, \"those\r\nendowed with the gift of preaching, clarified butter, sugar, and\r\nhoney.\"[3] Hospitals and medicines for their use, and rest houses on\r\ntheir journeys, were also provided at the public charge.[4] These\r\nexpedients were available so long as the numbers of the priesthood were\r\nlimited; but such were the multitudes who were tempted to withdraw from\r\nthe world and its pursuits, in order to devote themselves to meditation\r\nand the diffusion of Buddhism, that the difficulty became practical of\r\nmaintaining them by personal gifts, and the alternative suggested itself\r\nof setting apart lands for their support. This innovation was first\r\nresorted to during an interregnum. The Singhalese king Walagam Bahu,\r\nbeing expelled from his capital by a Malabar usurpation B.C. 104, was\r\nunable to continue the accustomed regal bounty to the priesthood;\r\ndedicated certain lands while in exile in Rohuna, for the support of a\r\nfraternity \"who had sheltered him there.\"[5] The precedent thus\r\nestablished, was speedily seized upon and extended; lands were\r\neverywhere set apart for the repair of the sacred edifices[6], and\r\neventually, about the beginning of the Christian era, the priesthood\r\nacquired such an increase of influence as sufficed to convert their\r\nprecarious eleemosynary dependency into a permanent territorial\r\nendowment; and the practice became universal of conveying estates in\r\nmortmain on the construction of a wihara or the dedication of a\r\ntemple.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xx. p. 123; xxii. p. 132,135.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxviii. p. 167.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxii. p. 196-7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxii. p. 196 xxxvii. p. 244;\r\n_Rajaratnacari_, p. 39, 41.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Mahawanso_, ch, xxxiii. p. 203.

To supply these, reservoirs were formed on such a scale as\r\nto justify the term \"consecrated lakes,\" by which they are described in\r\nthe Singhalese annals.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajaratnacari_, ch. ii. p. 37; _Rajavali_, p. 237.]\r\n\r\nWhere the circumstances of the ground permitted, their formation was\r\neffected by drawing an embankment across the embouchure of a valley so\r\nas to arrest and retain the waters by which it was traversed, and so\r\nvast were the dimensions of some of these gigantic tanks that many yet\r\nin existence still cover an area of from fifteen to twenty miles in\r\ncircumference. The ruins of that at Kalaweva, to the north-west of\r\nDambool, show that its original circuit could not have been less than\r\nforty miles, its retaining bund being upwards of twelve miles long. The\r\nspill-water of stone, which remains to the present time, is \"perhaps one\r\nof the most stupendous monuments of misapplied human labour in the\r\nisland.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: TURNOUR, _Mahawanso_, p. 12. The tank of Kalaweva was\r\nformed by Dhatu Sena, A.D. 459.--_Mahawanso_, ch. xxxviii. p. 257.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 104.]\r\n\r\nThe number of these stupendous works, which were formed by the early\r\nsovereigns of Ceylon, almost exceeds credibility. Kings are named in the\r\nnative annals, each of whom made from fifteen to thirty[1], together\r\nwith canals and all the appurtenances for irrigation. Originally these\r\nvast undertakings were completed \"for the benefit of the country,\" and\r\n\"out of compassion for living creatures;\"[2] but so early as the first\r\ncentury of the Christian era, the custom became prevalent of forming\r\ntanks with the pious intention of conferring the lands which they\r\nenriched on the church. Wide districts, rendered fertile by the\r\ninterception of a river and the formation of suitable canals, were\r\nappropriated to the maintenance of the local priesthood[3]; a tank and\r\nthe thousands of acres which it fertilised were sometimes assigned for\r\nthe perpetual repairs of a dagoba[4], and the revenues of whole villages\r\nand their surrounding rice fields were devoted to the support of a\r\nsingle wihara.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajaratnacari_, p. 41, 45, 54, 55; King Saidaitissa B.C.\r\n137, made \"eighteen lakes\" (_Rajavali_, p. 233).

The Buddhist kings of Burmah are\r\nstill accustomed to boast, almost in the terms of the _Mahawanso_, of\r\nthe distinction which they have earned, by the multitudes of tanks they\r\nhave constructed or restored. See YULE'S _Narrative of the Mission to\r\nAva in 1855_, p. 106.]\r\n\r\nThese broad possessions, the church, under all vicissitudes and\r\nrevolutions, has succeeded in retaining to the present day. Their\r\nterritories, it is true, have been diminished in extent by national\r\ndecay; the destruction of works for irrigation has converted into\r\nwilderness and jungle plains once teeming with fertility; and the mild\r\npolicy of the British government, by abolishing _raja-kariya_[1], has\r\nemancipated the peasantry, who are no longer the serfs either of the\r\ntemples or the chiefs. But in every district of the island the priests\r\nare in the enjoyment of the most fertile lands, over which the crown\r\nexercises no right of taxation; and such is the extent of their\r\npossessions that, although their precise limits have not been\r\nascertained by the local government, they have been conjectured with\r\nprobability to be equal to one-third of the cultivated land of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Compulsory labour.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 104.]\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity in the Buddhist ceremonial served at all times to give a\r\nsingular impulse to the progress of horticulture. Flowers and garlands\r\nare introduced in its religious rites to the utmost excess. The\r\natmosphere of the wiharas and temples is rendered oppressive with the\r\nperfume of champac and jessamine, and the shrine of the deity, the\r\npedestals of his image, and the steps leading to the temple are strewn\r\nthickly with blossoms of the nagaha and the lotus. At an earlier period\r\nthe profusion in which these beautiful emblems were employed in sacred\r\ndecorations appears almost incredible; the _Mahawanso_ relates that the\r\nRuanwellé dagoba, which was 270 feet in height, was on one occasion\r\n\"festooned with garlands from pedestal to pinnacle till it resembled one\r\nuniform bouquet;\" and at another time, it and the lofty dagoba at\r\nMihintala were buried under heaps of jessamine from the ground to the\r\nsummit.[1] Fa Hian, in describing his visit to Anarajapoora in the\r\nfourth century, dwells with admiration and wonder on the perfumes and\r\nflowers lavished on their worship by the Singhalese[2]; and the native\r\nhistorians constantly allude as familiar incidents to the profusion in\r\nwhich they were employed on ordinary occasions, and to the formation by\r\nsuccessive kings of innumerable gardens for the floral requirements of\r\nthe temples. The capital was surrounded on all sides[3] by flower\r\ngardens, and these were multiplied so extensively that, according to the\r\n_Rajaratnacari_, one was to be found within a distance of four leagues\r\nin any part of Ceylon.[4] Amongst the regulations of the temple built at\r\nDambedinia, in the thirteenth century, was \"every day an offering of\r\n100,000 flowers, and each day a different flower.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxiv.; _Rajaratnacari_, p. 52, 53.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: FA HIAN. _Foè Kouè Ki_, ch. xxxviii. p. 335.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Rajavali_, p. 227; _Mahawanso_, ch. xi. p. 67.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Rajaratnacari_, p. 29, 49. Amongst the officers attached\r\nto the great establishments of the priests in Mihintala, A.D. 246, there\r\nare enumerated in an inscription engraven on a rock there, a secretary,\r\na treasurer, a physician, a surgeon, a painter, twelve cooks, twelve\r\nthatchers, ten carpenters, six carters, and _two florists_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Rajaratnacari_, p. 103. The same book states that another\r\nking, in the fifteenth century, \"offered no less than 6,480,320 sweet\r\nsmelling flowers\" at the shrine of the Tooth.--_Ib._, p. 136.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 104.]\r\n\r\nAnother advantage conferred by Buddhism on the country was the planting\r\nof fruit trees and esculent vegetables for the gratuitous use of\r\ntravellers in all the frequented parts of the island. The historical\r\nevidences of this are singularly corroborative of the genuineness of the\r\nBuddhist edicts engraved on various rocks and monuments in India, the\r\ndeciphering of which was the grand achievement of Prinsep and his\r\nlearned coadjutors. On the pillars of Delhi, Allahabad, and other\r\nplaces, and on the rocks of Girnar and Dhauli, there exist a number of\r\nPali inscriptions purporting to be edicts of Asoca (the Dharmasoca of\r\nthe _Mahawanso_), King of Magadha, in the third century before the\r\nChristian era, who, on his conversion to the religion of Buddha,\r\ncommissioned Mahindo, his son, to undertake its establishment in Ceylon.\r\nIn these edicts, which were promulgated in the vernacular dialect, the\r\nking endeavoured to impress both upon his subjects and allies, as well\r\nas those who, although aliens, were yet \"united in the law\" of Buddha,\r\nthe divine precepts of their great teacher; prominent amongst which are\r\nthe prohibition against taking animal life[1], and the injunction that,\r\n\"everywhere wholesome vegetables, roots, and fruit trees shall be\r\ncultivated, and that on the roads wells shall be dug and trees planted\r\nfor the enjoyment of men and animals.\" In apparent conformity with these\r\nedicts, one of the kings of Ceylon, Addagaimunu, A.D. 20, is stated in\r\nthe _Mahawanso_ to have \"caused to be planted throughout the island\r\nevery description of fruit-bearing creepers, and interdicted the\r\ndestruction of animal life,\"[2] and similar acts of pious benevolence,\r\nperformed by command of various other sovereigns, are adverted to on\r\nnumerous occasions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is curious that one of these edicts of Asoca, who was\r\ncontemporary with Devenipiatissa, is addressed to \"all the conquered\r\nterritories of the raja, even unto the ends of the earth; as in Chola,\r\nin Pida, in Keralaputra, _and in Tambapanni_ (or Ceylon).\" This license\r\nof speech, reminding one of the grandiloquent epistles \"from the\r\nFlaminian Gate,\" was no doubt assumed in virtue of the recent\r\nestablishment of Buddhism, or, as it is called in the _Mahawanso_ \"the\r\nreligion of the Vanquisher,\" and Asoca, as its propagator, thus claims\r\nto address the converts as his \"subjects.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxv. p. 215. The king Upatissa, A.D. 368,\r\nin the midst of a solemn ceremonial, \"observing ants, and other insects\r\ndrowning in an inundation, halted, and having swept them towards the\r\nwith the feathers of a peacock's tail, and enabled them to save a\r\nthemselves, he continued the procession.\"--_Mahawanso_, ch. xxxvii p.\r\n249; _Rajaratnacari_, p. 49, 52; _Rajavali_, p. 228.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII\r\n\r\n\r\nFATE OF THE ABORIGINES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 104.]\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown, that devotion and policy combined to\r\naccelerate the progress of social improvement in Ceylon, and that before\r\nthe close of the third century of the Christian era, the island to the\r\nnorth of the Kandyan mountains contained numerous cities and villages,\r\nadorned with temples and dagobas, and seated in the midst of highly\r\ncultivated fields. The face of the country exhibited broad expanses of\r\nrice land, irrigated by artificial lakes, and canals of proportionate\r\nmagnitude, by which the waters from the rivers, which would otherwise\r\nhave flowed idly to the sea, were diverted inland in all directions to\r\nfertilise the rice fields of the interior.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxv. xxxvii.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 104.]\r\n\r\nIn the formation of these prodigious tanks, the labour chiefly employed\r\nwas that of the aboriginal inhabitants, the Yakkhos and Nagas, directed\r\nby the science and skill of the conquerors. Their contributions of this\r\nkind, though in the instance of the Buddhist converts they may have been\r\nto some extent voluntary, were, in general, the result of compulsion.[1]\r\nLike the Israelites under the Egyptians, the aborigines were compelled\r\nto make bricks[2] for the stupendous dagobas erected by their\r\nmasters[3]; and eight hundred years after the subjugation of the island,\r\nthe _Rajavali_ describes vast reservoirs and appliances for irrigation,\r\nas being constructed by the forced labour of the  Yakkhos[4] under the\r\nsuperintendence of Brahman engineers.[5] This, to some extent, accounts\r\nfor the prodigious amount of labour bestowed on these structures; labour\r\nwhich the whole revenue of the kingdom would not have sufficed to\r\npurchase, had it not been otherwise procurable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In some instances the soldiers of the king were employed in\r\nforming works of irrigation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxviii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Ibid_., ch. xxvii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Rajavali_, p. 237, 238. Exceptions to the extortion of\r\nforced labour for public works took place under the more pious kings,\r\nwho made a merit of paying the workmen employed in the erection of\r\ndagobas and other religious monuments.--_Mahawanso_, ch, xxxv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Maharwanso_, ch. x.]\r\n\r\nUnder this system, the fate of the aborigines was that usually\r\nconsequent on the subjugation of an inferior race by one more highly\r\ncivilised. The process of their absorption into the dominant race was\r\nslow, and for centuries they continued to exist distinct, as a\r\nsubjugated people. So firmly rooted amongst them was the worship both of\r\ndemons and serpents, that, notwithstanding the ascendency of Buddhism,\r\nmany centuries elapsed before it was ostensibly abandoned; from time to\r\ntime, \"demon offerings\" were made from the royal treasury[1]; and one of\r\nthe kings, in his enlarged liberality, ordered that for every ten\r\nvillages there should be maintained an astrologer and a \"devil-dancer,\"\r\nin addition to the doctor and the priest.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. x.; TURNOUR'S _Epitome_. p. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, p. 27; _Rajaratnacari_, ch. ii.;\r\n_Rajavali_, p. 241.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the Singhalese chronicles, the notices of the aborigines are\r\nbut casual, and occasionally contemptuous. Sometimes they allude to\r\n\"slaves of the Yakkho tribe,\"[1] and in recording the progress and\r\ncompletion of the tanks and other stupendous works, the _Mahawanso_ and\r\nthe _Rajaratnacari_, in order to indicate the inferiority of the natives\r\nto their masters, speak of their conjoint labours as that of \"men and\r\nsnakes,\"[2] and \"men and demons.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. x.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Ibid., ch. xix, p. 115.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The King Maha-Sen, anxious for the promotion of\r\nagriculture, caused many tanks to be made \"by men and\r\ndevils.\"--_Mahawanso_, ch. xxxvii.; UPHAM'S _Transl.; Rajaratnacari_, p.\r\n69; _Rajavali_, p. 237.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 104.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the degradation of the natives, it was indispensable to\r\n\"befriend the interests\" of a race so numerous and so useful; hence,\r\nthey were frequently employed in the military expeditions of the Wijayan\r\nsovereigns[1], and the earlier kings of that dynasty admitted the rank\r\nof the Yakkho chiefs who shared in these enterprises. They assigned a\r\nsuburb of the capital for their residence[2], and on festive occasions\r\nthey were seated on thrones of equal eminence with that of the king.[3]\r\nBut every aspiration towards a recovery of their independence was\r\nchecked by a device less characteristic of ingenuity in the ascendant\r\nrace, than of simplicity combined with jealousy in the aborigines. The\r\nfeeling was encouraged and matured into a conviction which prevailed to\r\nthe latest period of the Singhalese sovereignty, that no individual of\r\npure Singhalese extraction could be elevated to the supreme power, since\r\nno one could prostrate himself before one of his own nation.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso,_ ch. x.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid.,_ ch. x. p. 67.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Ibid.,_ p. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: JOINVILLE'S _Asiat. Res,_ vol. vii. p. 422.]\r\n\r\nFor successive generations, however, the natives, although treated with\r\npartial kindness, were regarded as a separate race. Even the children of\r\nWijayo, by his first wife Kuweni, united themselves with their maternal\r\nconnexions on the repudiation of their mother by the king, \"and retained\r\nthe attributes of Yakkhos,\"[1] and by that designation the natives\r\ncontinued to be distinguished down to the reign of Dutugaimunu.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso,_ ch. vii.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 104.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of every attempt at conciliation, the process of amalgamation\r\nbetween the two races was reluctant and slow. The earliest Bengal\r\nimmigrants sought wives among the Tamils, on the opposite coast of\r\nIndia[1]; and although their descendants intermarried with the natives,\r\nthe great mass of the population long held aloof from the invaders, and\r\noccasionally vented their impatience in rebellion.[2] Hence the progress\r\nof civilisation amongst them was but partial and slow, and in the\r\nnarratives of the early rulers of the island there is ample evidence\r\nthat the aborigines long retained their habits of shyness and timidity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ibid.,_ p. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch, lxxxv.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the frequent resort of every nation of antiquity to its\r\ncoasts, the accounts of the first voyagers are almost wholly confined to\r\ndescriptions of the loveliness of the country, the singular brilliancy\r\nof its jewels, the richness of its pearls, the sagacity of its\r\nelephants, and the delicacy and abundance of its spices; but the\r\ninformation which they furnish regarding its inhabitants is so uniformly\r\nmeagre, as to attest the absence of intercourse; and the writers of all\r\nnations, Romans, Greeks, Arabians, Chinese and Indians, concur in their\r\nallusions to the unsocial and uncivilised customs of the islanders.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See an account of these singular peculiarities, Vol. I. P.\r\nIV. c. vii.]\r\n\r\nAs the Bengal adventurers advanced into the interior of the island, a\r\nlarge section of the natives withdrew into the forests and hunting\r\ngrounds on the eastern and southern coasts.[1] There, subsisting by the\r\nbow[2] and the chase, they adhered, with moody tenacity, to the rude\r\nhabits of their race; and in the Veddah of the present day, there is\r\nstill to be recognised a remnant of the untamed aborigines of Ceylon.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Hiouen Thsang,_ the Chinese geographer, who visited India\r\nin the seventh century, says that at that time the Yakkhos had retired\r\nto the south-east corner of Ceylon;--and here their descendants, the\r\nVeddahs, are found at the present day,--_Voyages,_ &c., liv. iv. p.\r\n200.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso,_ ch. xxiv. p. 145, xxxiii. p. 204.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: DE ALWIS, _Sidath Sangara,_ p. xvii.

Traces of the worship of\r\nsnakes and demons are to the present hour clearly perceptible amongst\r\nthem; the Buddhists still resort to the incantations of the \"devil\r\ndancers\" in case of danger and emergency[1]; a Singhalese, rather than\r\nput a Cobra de Capello to death, encloses the reptile in a wicker cage,\r\nand sets it adrift on the nearest stream; and in the island of\r\nNainativoe, to the south-west of Jaffa, there was till recently a little\r\ntemple, dedicated to the goddess Naga Tambiran, in which consecrated\r\nserpents were tenderly reared by the Pandarams, and daily fed at the\r\nexpense of the worshippers.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For an account of Demon worship as it still exists in\r\nCeylon, see Sir J.

VIII\r\n\r\nEXTINCTION OF THE \"GREAT DYNASTY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 104.]\r\n\r\nFrom the death of Dutugaimunu to the exhaustion of the superior dynasty\r\non the death of Malta-Sen, A.D. 301, there are few demonstrations of\r\npious munificence to signalise the policy of the intervening sovereigns.\r\nThe king whom, next to Devenipiatissa and Dutugaimunu, the Buddhist\r\nhistorians rejoice to exalt as one of the champions of the faith, was\r\nWalagam-bahu I.[1], whose reign, though marked by vicissitudes, was\r\nproductive of lasting benefit to the national faith. Walagam-bahu\r\nascended the throne B.C. 104., but was almost immediately forced to\r\nabdicate by an incursion of the Malabars; who, concerting a simultaneous\r\nlanding at several parts of the island, combined their movements so\r\nsuccessfully that they seized on Anarajapoora, and drove the king into\r\nconcealment in the mountains near Adam's Peak; and whilst one portion of\r\nthe invaders returned laden with plunder to the Dekkan, their companions\r\nremained behind and held undisputed possession of the northern parts of\r\nCeylon for nearly fifteen years.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Called in the _Mahawanso_, \"Wata-gamini\".]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 104.]\r\n\r\nIn this and the frequent incursions which followed, the Malabar leaders\r\nwere attracted by the wealth of the country to the north of the\r\nMahawelli-ganga; the southern portion of the island being either too\r\nwild and unproductive to present a temptation to conquest, or too steep\r\nand inaccessible to afford facilities for invasion. Besides, the\r\nhighlanders who inhabit the lofty ranges that lie around Adam's Peak; (a\r\ndistrict known as Malaya, \"the region of mountains and torrents,\")[1]\r\nthen and at all times exhibited their superiority over the lowlanders in\r\nvigour, courage, and endurance. Hence the petty kingdoms of Maya and\r\nRohuna afforded on every occasion a refuge to the royal family when\r\ndriven from the northern capital, and furnished a force to assist in\r\ntheir return and restoration. Walagam-bahu, after many years'\r\nconcealment there, was at last enabled to resume the offensive, and\r\nsucceeded in driving out the infidels, and recovering possession of the\r\nsacred city, an event which he commemorated in the usual manner by the\r\nerection of dagobas, tanks, and wiharas.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. vii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ALU WIHARA NEAR MATELLE.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 89.]\r\n\r\nBut the achievement by which most of all he entitled himself to the\r\ngratitude of the Singhalese annalists, was the reduction to writing of\r\nthe doctrines and discourses of Buddha, which had been orally delivered\r\nby Mahindo, and previously preserved by tradition alone. These sacred\r\nvolumes, which may be termed the Buddhist Scriptures, contain the\r\nPittakataya, and its commentaries the Atthakatha, and were compiled by a\r\ncompany of priests in a cave to the north of Matelle, known as the\r\nAloo-wihara.[1] This, and other caverns in which the king had sought\r\nconcealment during his adversity, he caused to be converted into rock\r\ntemples after his restoration to power. Amongst the rest, Dambool, which\r\nis the most remarkable of the cave temples of Ceylon from its vastness,\r\nits elaborate ornaments, and the romantic beauty of its situation and\r\nthe scenery surrounding it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajaratnacari_, ch. i. p. 43. Abouzeyd states that at that\r\ntime public writers were employed in recording the traditions of the\r\nisland: \"Le Royaume de Serendyb a une loi et des docteurs qui\r\ns'assemblent de temps en temps comme se réunissent chez nous les\r\npersonnes qui recreillent les traditions du prophète, et les Indiens se\r\nrendent auprès des docteurs, et écrivent sous leurs dictée, la vie de\r\nleurs prophètes et les préceptes de leur loi.\"--REINAUD, _Relation,\r\n&c.,_ tom. i. p. 127.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 62.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 50.]\r\n\r\nThe history of the Buddhist religion in Ceylon is not, however, a tale\r\nof uniform prosperity. The first of its domestic enemies was Naga, the\r\ngrandson of the pious Walagam-bahu, whom the native, historians\r\nstigmatise by the prefix of \"chora\" or the \"marauder.\" His story is thus\r\nbriefly but emphatically told in the _Mahawanso_: \"During the reign of\r\nhis father Mahachula, Chora Naga wandered through the island leading the\r\nlife of a robber; returning on the demise of the king he assumed the\r\nmonarchy; and in the places which had denied him an asylum during his\r\nmarauding career, he impiously destroyed the wiharas.[1] After a reign\r\nof twelve years he was poisoned by his queen Anula, and regenerated in\r\nthe Lokantariko hell.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxiii.; _Rajarali_, p. 224; TURNOUR'S\r\n_Epitome_, p. 19; _Rajaratnacari_, ch. i. p. 43, 44.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxiv. p. 209.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 47.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 41.]\r\n\r\nHis son, King Kuda Tissa, was also poisoned by his mother, in order to\r\nclear her own way to the throne. The Singhalese annals thus exhibit the\r\nunusual incident of a queen enrolled amongst the monarchs of the _great\r\ndynasty_--a precedent which was followed in after times; Queen Siwalli\r\nhaving reigned in the succeeding century, A.D. 37, Queen Lila-wati, in\r\nA.D. 1197, and Queen Kalyana-wati in A.D. 1202. From the excessive\r\nvileness of her character, the first of these Singhalese women who\r\nattained to the honours of sovereignty is denounced in the _Mahawanso_\r\nas \"the infamous Anula.\" In the enormity of her crimes and debauchery\r\nshe was the Messalina of Ceylon;--she raised to the throne a porter of\r\nthe palace with whom she cohabited, descending herself to the\r\nsubordinate rank of Queen Consort, and poisoned him to promote a\r\ncarpenter in his stead. A carrier of firewood, a Brahman, and numerous\r\nother paramours followed in rapid succession, and shared a similar fate,\r\ntill the kingdom was at last relieved from the opprobrium by a son of\r\nPrince Tissa, who put the murderess to death, and restored the royal\r\nline in his own person. His successors for more than two centuries were\r\na race of pious _fainéants_, undistinguished by any qualities, and\r\nremembered only by their fanatical subserviency to the priesthood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 209.]\r\n\r\nBuddhism, relieved from the fury of impiety, was next imperilled by the\r\ndanger of schism. Even before the funeral obsequies of Buddha, schism\r\nhad displayed itself in Maghadha, and two centuries had not elapsed from\r\nhis death till it had manifested itself on no less than seventeen\r\noccasions, and in each instance it was with difficulty checked by\r\ncouncils in which the priesthood settled the faith in relation to the\r\npoints which gave rise to dispute; but not before the actual occurrence\r\nof secessions from the orthodox church.[1] The earliest differences were\r\non questions of discipline amongst the colleges and fraternities at\r\nAnarajapoora; but in the reign of Wairatissa, A.D. 209, a formidable\r\ncontroversy arose, impugning the doctrines of Buddhism, and threatening\r\nfor a time to rend in sunder the sacred unity of the church.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. v. p. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Ibid., ch. xxxiii.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 209.]\r\n\r\nBuddhism, although, tolerant of heresy, has ever been vehement in its\r\npersecution of schism. Boldly confident in its own superiority, it bears\r\nwithout impatience the glaring errors of open antagonists, and seems to\r\nexult in the contiguity of competing systems as if deriving strength by\r\ncomparison. In this respect it exhibits a similarity to the religion of\r\nBrahma, which regards with composure shades of doctrinal difference, and\r\nonly rises into jealous energy in support of the distinctions of caste,\r\nan infringement of which might endanger the supremacy of the\r\npriesthood.[1] To the assaults of open opponents the Buddhist displays\r\nthe calmest indifference, convinced that in its undiminished strength,\r\nhis faith is firm and inexpugnable; his vigilance is only excited by the\r\nalarm of internal dissent, and all his passions are aroused to stifle\r\nthe symptoms of schism.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Hence the indomitable hatred with which the Brahmans\r\npursued the disciples of Buddhism from the fourth century before Christ\r\nto its final expulsion from Hindustan. \"Abundant proofs,\" says Turnour,\r\n\"may be adduced to show the fanatical ferocity with which these two\r\ngreat sects persecuted each other; and which, subsided into passive\r\nhatred and contempt, only when the parties were no longer placed in the\r\nposition of actual collision.\"--Introd. _Mahawanso_, p. xxii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In its earliest form Buddhism was equally averse to\r\npersecution, and the _Mahawanso_ extols the liberality of Asoca in\r\ngiving alms indiscriminately to the members of all religions\r\n_(Mahawanso_, ch. v. p. 23). A sect which is addicted to persecution is\r\nnot likely to speak approvingly of toleration, but the _Mahawanso_\r\nrecords with evident satisfaction the courtesy paid to the sacred things\r\nof Buddhism by the believers in other doctrines; thus the Nagas did\r\nhomage to the relics of Buddha and mourned their removal from Mount Meru\r\n(_Mahawanso_, ch. xxxi. p. 189); the Yakkhos assisted at the building of\r\ndagobas to enshrine them, and the Brahmans were the first to respect the\r\nBo-tree on its arrival in Ceylon (_Ib._ ch. xix. p. 119). COSMAS\r\nINDICOPLEUSTES, whose informant, Sopater, visited Ceylon in the sixth\r\ncentury, records that there was then the most extended toleration, and\r\nthat even the Nestorian Christians had perfect freedom and protection\r\nfor their worship.\r\n\r\nAmong the Buddhists of Burmah, however, \"although they are tolerant of\r\nthe practice of other religions by those who profess them, secession\r\nfrom the national faith, is rigidly prohibited, and a convert to any\r\nother form of faith incurs the penalty of death.\"--Professor WILSON,\r\n_Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc._ vol. xvi. p. 261.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 209.]\r\n\r\nThis characteristic of the \"religion of the Vanquisher\" is in strict\r\nconformity, not alone with the spirit of his doctrine, but also with the\r\nletter of the law laid down for the guidance of his disciples. Two of\r\nthe singular rock-inscriptions of India deciphered by Prinsep, inculcate\r\nthe duty of leaving the profession of different faiths unmolested; on\r\nthe ground, that \"all aim at moral restraint and purity of life,\r\nalthough all cannot be equally successful in attaining to it.\" The\r\nsentiments embodied in one of the edicts[1] of King Asoca are very\r\nstriking: \"A man must honour his own faith, without blaming that of his\r\nneighbour, and thus will but little that is wrong occur. There are even\r\ncircumstances under which the faith of others should be honoured, and in\r\nacting thus a man increases his own faith and weakens that of others. He\r\nwho acts differently, diminishes his own faith and injures that of\r\nanother. Whoever he may be who honours his own faith and blames that of\r\nothers out of devotion to his own, and says, 'let us make our faith\r\nconspicuous,' that man merely injures the faith he holds. Concord alone\r\nis to be desired.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The twelfth tablet, which, as translated by BURNOUF and\r\nProfessor WILSON, will be found in Mrs. SPEIR'S _Life in Ancient India_,\r\nbook ii. ch. iv. p. 239.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 209.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 248.]\r\n\r\nThe obligation, to maintain the religion of Buddha was as binding as the\r\ncommand to abstain from assailing that of its rivals, and hence the\r\nkings who had treated the snake-worshippers with kindness, who had made\r\na state provision for maintaining \"offerings to demons,\" and built\r\ndwellings at the capital to accommodate the \"ministers of foreign\r\nreligions,\" rose in fierce indignation against the preaching of a firm\r\nbeliever in Buddha, who ventured to put an independent interpretation on\r\npoints of faith. They burned the books of the Wytulians, as the new sect\r\nwere called, and frustrated their irreligious attempt.[1] The first\r\neffort at repression was ineffectual. It was made by the King\r\nWairatissa, A.D. 209; but within forty years the schismatic tendency\r\nreturned, the persecution was renewed, and the apostate priests, after\r\nbeing branded on the back were ignominiously transported to the opposite\r\ncoast of India.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The _Mahawanso_ throws no light on the nature of the\r\nWytulian (or Wettulyan) heresy (ch. xxvii. p. 227), but the\r\n_Rajaratnacari_ insinuates that Wytulia was a Brahman who had \"subverted\r\nby craft and intrigue the religion of Buddha\" (ch. ii, p. 61). As it is\r\nstated in a further passage that the priests who were implicated were\r\nstripped of their habits, it is evident that the innovation had been\r\nintroduced under the garb of Buddha.--_Rajaratnacari_, ch. ii. p. 65.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, p. 25, _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxvi. p. 232.\r\nAs the _Mahawanso_ intimates in another passage that amongst the priests\r\nwho were banished to the opposite coast of India, there was one\r\nSangha-mitta, \"who was profoundly versed in the rites of the demon faith\r\n('bhuta'),\" it is probable that out of the Wytulian heresy grew the\r\nsystem which prevails to the present day, by which the heterodox\r\n_dewales_ and halls for devil dances are built in close contiguity to\r\nthe temples and wiharas of the orthodox Buddhists, and the barbarous\r\nrites of demon worship are incorporated with the abstractions of the\r\nnational religion. On the restoration of Maha-Sen to the true faith, the\r\n_Mahawanso_ represents him as destroying the _dewales_ at Anarajapoora\r\nin order to replace them with wiharas (_Mahawanso_, ch. xxxvii. p. 237).\r\nAn account of the mingling of Brahmanical with Buddhist worship, as it\r\nexists at the present day, will be found in HARDY'S _Oriental\r\nMonachism_, ch. xix. Professor H.H. WILSON, in his _Historical Sketch of\r\nthe Kingdom of Pandya_, alludes to a heresy, which, anterior to the\r\nsixth century, disturbed the _sangattar_ or college of Madura; the\r\nleading feature of which was the admixture of Buddhist doctrines with\r\nthe rite of the Brahmans, and \"this heresy,\" he says, \"some traditions\r\nassert was introduced from Ceylon.\"--_Asiat. Journ._ vol. iii. p. 218.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 275.]\r\n\r\nThe new sect had, however, established an interest in high places; and\r\nSangha-mitta, one of the exiled priests, returning from banishment on\r\nthe death of the king, so ingratiated himself with his successor, that\r\nhe was entrusted with the education of the king's sons. One of the\r\nlatter, Maha-Sen, succeeded to the throne, A.D. 275, and, openly\r\nprofessing his adoption of the Wytulian tenets, dispossessed the popular\r\npriesthood, and overthrew the Brazen Palace. With the materials of the\r\ngreat wihara, he constructed at the sacred Bo-tree a building as a\r\nreceptacle for relics, and a temple in which the statue of Buddha was to\r\nbe worshipped according to the rites of the reformed religion.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxvii. p. 235.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 275.]\r\n\r\nSo bold an innovation roused the passions of the nation; the people\r\nprepared for revolt, and a conflict was imminent, when the schismatic\r\nSangha-mitta was suddenly assassinated, and the king, convinced of his\r\nerrors, addressed himself with energy to restore the buildings he had\r\ndestroyed, and to redress the mischiefs chiefs caused by his apostacy.\r\nHe demolished the dewales of the Hindus, in order to use their sites for\r\nBuddhist wiharas; he erected nunneries, constructed the Jaytawanarama (a\r\ndagoba at Anarajapoora), formed the great tank of Mineri by drawing a\r\ndam across the Kara-ganga and that of Kandelay or Dantalawa, and\r\nconsecrated the 20,000 fields which it irrigated to the Dennanaka\r\nWihare.[1] \"He repaired numerous dilapidated temples throughout the\r\nisland, made offerings of a thousand robes to a thousand priests, formed\r\nsixteen tanks to extend cultivation--there is no defining the extent of\r\nhis charity\"--and having performed during his existence acts both of\r\npiety and impity, the _Mahawanso_ cautiously adds, \"his destiny after\r\ndeath was according to his merits.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: TURNOUR's _Epitome_, p. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxiii. p. 238.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 302.]\r\n\r\nWith King Maha-Sen end the glories of the \"superior dynasty\" of Ceylon.\r\nThe \"sovereigns of the _Suluwanse_, who followed,\" says the _Rajavali_,\r\n\"were no longer of the unmixed blood, but the offspring of parents, only\r\none of whom was descended from the sun, and the other from the bringer\r\nof the Bo-tree or the sacred tooth; on that account, because the God\r\nSakkraia had ceased to watch over Ceylon, because piety had disappeared,\r\nand the city of Anarajapoora was in ruins, and because the fertility of\r\nthe land was diminished, the kings who succeeded Maha-Sen were no longer\r\nreverenced as of old.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajavali_, p. 289.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 302.]\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of Ceylon, though it may not have attained its acme, was\r\nsound and auspicious in the beginning of the fourth century, when the\r\nsolar line became extinct. Pihiti, the northern portion of the island,\r\nwas that which most engaged the solicitude of the crown, from its\r\ncontaining the ancient capital, whence it obtained its designation of\r\nthe Raja-ratta or country of the kings. Here the labour bestowed on\r\nirrigation had made the food of the population abundant, and the sums\r\nexpended on the adornment of the city, the multitude of its sacred\r\nstructures, the splendour of its buildings, and the beauty of its lakes\r\nand gardens, rendered it no inappropriate representative of the wealth\r\nand fertility of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nAnarajapoora had from time immemorial been a venerated locality in the\r\neyes of the Buddhists; it had been honoured by the visit of Buddha in\r\nperson, and it was already a place of importance when Wijayo effected\r\nhis landing in the fifth century before the Christian era. It became the\r\ncapital a century after, and the King Pandukabhaya, who formed the\r\nornamental lake which adjoined it, and planted gardens and parks for\r\npublic festivities, built gates and four suburbs to the city; set apart\r\nground for a public cemetery, and erected a gilded hall of audience, and\r\na palace for his own residence.\r\n\r\nThe _Mahawanso_ describes with particularity the offices of the\r\nNaggaraguttiko, who was the chief of the city guard, and the\r\norganisation of the low caste Chandalas, who were entrusted with the\r\ncleansing of the capital and the removal of the dead for interment. For\r\nthese and for the royal huntsmen villages were constructed in the\r\nenvirons, mingled with which were dwellings for the subjugated native\r\ntribes, and temples for the worship of foreign devotees.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. x. p. 66.]\r\n\r\nSeventy years later, when Mahindo arrived in Ceylon, the details of his\r\nreception disclose the increased magnificence of the capital, the\r\nrichness of the royal parks, and the extent of the state establishments;\r\nand describe the chariots in which the king drove to Mihintala to\r\nwelcome his exalted guest.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Ibid., ch. xiv., xv., xx.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 302.]\r\n\r\nYet these were but preliminary to the grander constructions which gave\r\nthe city its lasting renown; stupendous dagobas raised by successive\r\nmonarchs, each eager to surpass the conceptions of his predecessors;\r\ntemples in which were deposited statues of gold adorned with gems and\r\nnative pearls; the decorated terraces of the Bo-tree, and the Brazen\r\nPalace, with its thousand chambers and its richly embellished halls. The\r\ncity was enclosed by a rampart upwards of twenty feet in height[1],\r\nwhich was afterwards replaced by a wall[2]; and, so late as the fourth\r\ncentury, the Chinese traveller Fa Hian describes the condition of the\r\nplace in terms which fully corroborate the accounts of the _Mahawanso_.\r\nIt was crowded, he says, with nobles, magistrates, and foreign\r\nmerchants; the houses were handsome, and the public buildings richly\r\nadorned. The streets and highways were broad and level, and halls for\r\npreaching and reading _bana_ were erected in all the thoroughfares. He\r\nwas assured that the island contained not less than from fifty to sixty\r\nthousand ecclesiastics, who all ate in common; and of whom from five to\r\nsix thousand were supported by the bounty of the king.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: By WASABHA, A.D. 66. _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxv. p. 222.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: TURNOUR, in his _Epitome of the History of Ceylon_, says\r\nthat Anarajapoora was enclosed by a rampart seven cubits high, B.C. 41,\r\nand that A.D. 66 King Wasabha built a wall round the city sixteen gows\r\nin circumference. As he estimates the gow at four English miles, this\r\nwould give an area equal to about 300 square miles. A space so\r\nprodigious for the capital seems to be disproportionate to the extent of\r\nthe kingdom, and far too extended for the wants of the population.\r\nTURNOUR does not furnish the authority on which he gives the dimensions,\r\nnor have I been able to discover it in the _Rajavali_ nor in the\r\n_Rajaratnacari_. The _Mahawanso_ alludes to the fact of Anarajapoora\r\nhaving been fortified by Wasabha, but, instead of a wall, the work which\r\nit describes this king to have undertaken, was the raising of the height\r\nof the rampart from seven cubits to eighteen (_Mahawanso_, ch. xxxv. p.\r\n222). Major Forbes, in his account of the ruins of the ancient city,\r\nrepeats the story of their former extent, in which he no doubt\r\nconsidered that the high authority of Turnour in matters of antiquity\r\nwas sustained by a statement made by Lieutenant Skinner, who had\r\nsurveyed the ruins in 1822, to the effect that he had discovered near\r\nAlia-parte the remains of masonry, which he concluded to be a portion of\r\nthe ancient city wall running north and south and forming the west face;\r\nand, as Alia-parte is seven miles from Anarajapoora, he regarded this\r\ndiscovery as confirming the account given of its original dimensions.\r\nLieutenant, now Major, Skinner has recently informed me that, on mature\r\nreflection, he has reason to fear that his first inference was\r\nprecipitate. In a letter of the 8th of May, 1856, he says:--\"It was in\r\n1833 I first visited Anarajapoora, when I made my survey of its ruins.\r\nThe supposed foundation of the western face of the city wall was pointed\r\nout near the village of Alia-parte by the people, and I hastily adopted\r\nit. I had not at the time leisure to follow up this search and determine\r\nhow far it extended, but from subsequent visits to the place I have been\r\nled to doubt the accuracy of this tradition, though on most other points\r\nI found the natives tolerably accurate in their knowledge of the history\r\nof the ancient capital. I have since sought for traces of the other\r\nfaces of the supposed wall, at the distances from the centre of the city\r\nat which it was said to have existed, but without success.\" The ruins\r\nwhich Major Skinner saw at Alia-parte are most probably those of one of\r\nthe numerous forts which the Singhalese kings erected at a much later\r\nperiod, to keep the Malabars in check.]\r\n\r\nThe sacred tooth of Buddha was publicly exposed on sacred days in the\r\ncapital with gorgeous ceremonies, which he recounts, and thence carried\r\nin procession to \"the mountains without fear;\" the road to which was\r\nperfumed and decked with flowers for the occasion; and the festival was\r\nconcluded by a dramatic representation of events in the life of Buddha,\r\nillustrated by scenery and costumes, with figures of elephants and\r\nstags, so delicately coloured as to be undistinguishable from nature.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: FA HIAN, _Fo[)e] Kou[)e] Ki_, ch. xxxviii. p. 334, &c.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\nKINGS OF THE \"LOWER DYNASTY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 302.]\r\n\r\nThe story of the kings of Ceylon of the _Sulu-wanse_ or \"lower line,\" is\r\nbut a narrative of the decline of the power and prosperity which had\r\nbeen matured under the Bengal conquerors and of the rise of the Malabar\r\nmarauders, whose ceaseless forays and incursions eventually reduced\r\nauthority to feebleness and the island to desolation. The vapid\r\nbiography of the royal imbeciles who filled the throne from the third to\r\nthe thirteenth century scarcely embodies an incident of sufficient\r\ninterest to diversify the monotonous repetition of temples founded and\r\ndagobas repaired, of tanks constructed and priests endowed with lands\r\nreclaimed and fertilised by the \"forced labour\" of the subjugated races.\r\nCivil dissensions, religious schisms, royal intrigues and assassinations\r\ncontributed equally with foreign invasions to diminish the influence of\r\nthe monarchy and exhaust the strength of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nOf sixty-two sovereigns who reigned from the death of Maha-Sen, A.D.\r\n301, to the accession of Prakrama Bahu, A.D. 1153, nine met a violent\r\ndeath at the hands of their relatives or subjects, two ended their days\r\nin exile, one was slain by the Malabars, and four committed suicide. Of\r\nthe lives of the larger number the Buddhist historians fail to furnish\r\nany important incidents; they relate merely the merit which each\r\nacquired by his liberality to the national religion or the more\r\nsubstantial benefits conferred on the people by the formation of lakes\r\nfor irrigation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 330.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 339.]\r\n\r\nUnembarrassed by any questions of external policy or foreign\r\nexpeditions, and limited to a narrow range of internal administration, a\r\nfew of the early kings addressed themselves to intellectual pursuits.\r\nOne immortalised himself in the estimation of the devout by his skill in\r\npainting and sculpture, and in carving in ivory, arts which he displayed\r\nby modelling statues of Buddha, and which he employed himself in\r\nteaching to his subjects.[1] Another was equally renowned as a medical\r\nauthor and a practitioner of surgery[2], and a third was so passionately\r\nattached to poetry that in despair for the death of Kalidas[3], he flung\r\nhimself into the flames of the poet's funeral pile.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Detoo Tissa, A.D. 330, _Mahawanso_, xxxvii. p. 242.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Budha Daasa, A.D. 339. _Mahawanso_, xxxvii, p. 243.

For an\r\naccount of Kalidas, see DE ALWIS'S _Sidath Sangara_, p. cliv.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 400.]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the embassy sent from Ceylon to Rome in the reign\r\nof the Emperor Claudius[1], the earliest diplomatic intercourse with\r\nforeigners of which a record exists, occurred in the fourth or fifth\r\ncenturies, when the Singhalese appear to have sent ambassadors to the\r\nEmperor Julian[2], and for the first time to have established a friendly\r\nconnection with China. It is strange, considering the religious\r\nsympathies which united the two people, that the native chronicles make\r\nno mention of the latter negotiations or their results, so that we learn\r\nof them only through Chinese historians. The _Encyclopoedia_ of\r\nMA-TOUAN-LIN, written at the close of the thirteenth century[3], records\r\nthat Ceylon first entered into political relations with China in the\r\nfourth century.[4] It was about the year 400 A.D., says the author, \"in\r\nthe reign of the Emperor Nyan-ti, that ambassadors arrived from Ceylon\r\nbearing a statue of Fo in jade-stone four feet two inches high, painted\r\nin five colours, and of such singular beauty that one would have almost\r\ndoubted its being a work of human ingenuity. It was placed in the\r\nBuddhist temple at Kien-Kang (Nankin).\" In the year 428 A.D., the King\r\nof Ceylon (Maha Nama) sent envoys to offer tribute, and this homage was\r\nrepeated between that period and A.D. 529, by three other Singhalese\r\nkings, whose names it is difficult to identify with their Chinese\r\ndesignations of Kia-oe, Kia-lo, and the Ho-li-ye.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: PLINY, lib. vi. c. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: AMMIANUS MARCELLINUS, lib. XX. c. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: KLAPROTH doubts, \"si la science de l'Europe a produit\r\njusqu'à présent un ouvrage de ce genre aussi bien exécuté et capable de\r\nsoutenir la comparaison avec cette encyclopédie chinoise.\"--_Journ.\r\nAsiat._ tom. xxi. p. 3.

STANISLAS\r\nJULIEN says that in another Chinese work, _Pien-i-tien_, or _The History\r\nof Foreign Nations_, there is a compilation including every passage in\r\nwhich Chinese authors have written of Ceylon, which occupies about forty\r\npages 4to. _Ib_. tom. xxix. p. 39. A number of these authorities will be\r\nfound extracted in the chapter in which I have described the intercourse\r\nbetween China and Ceylon, Vol. I. P. v. ch. iii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Between the years 317 and 420 A.D.--_Journ. Asiat._ tom.\r\nxxviii. p. 401.]\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 670, another ambassador arrived from Ceylon, and A.D. 742,\r\nChi-lo-mi-kia sent presents to the Emperor of China consisting of pearls\r\n(_perles de feu_), golden flowers, precious stones, ivory, and pieces of\r\nfine cotton cloth. At a later period mutual intercourse became frequent\r\nbetween the two countries, and some of the Chinese travellers who\r\nresorted to Ceylon have left valuable records as to the state of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 413.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 432.]\r\n\r\nIt was during the reign of Maha Nama, about the year 413 A.D., that\r\nCeylon was visited by Fa Hian, and the statements of the _Mahawanso_ are\r\ncuriously corroborated by the observations recorded by this Chinese\r\ntraveller. He describes accurately the geniality of the climate, whose\r\nuniform temperature rendered the seasons undistinguishable. Winter and\r\nsummer, he says, are alike unknown, but perpetual verdure realises the\r\nidea of a perennial spring, and periods for seed time and harvest are\r\nregulated by the taste of the husbandman. This statement has reference\r\nto the multitude of tanks which rendered agriculture independent of the\r\nperiodical rains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 459.]\r\n\r\nFa Hian speaks of the lofty monuments which were the memorials of\r\nBuddha, and of the gems and gold which adorned his statues at\r\nAnarajapoora. Amongst the most surprising of these was a figure in what\r\nhe calls \"blue jasper,\" inlaid with jewels and other precious materials,\r\nand holding in one hand a pearl of inestimable value.[1] He describes\r\nthe Bo-tree in terms which might almost be applied to its actual\r\ncondition at the present day, and he states that they had recently\r\nerected a building to contain \"the tooth of Buddha,\" which was exhibited\r\nto the pious in the middle of the third moon with processions and\r\nceremonies which he minutely details.[2] All this corresponds closely\r\nwith the narrative of the _Mahawanso_. The sacred tooth of Buddha,\r\ncalled at that time _Dáthá dhátu_, and now the _Dalada_, had been\r\nbrought to Ceylon a short time before Fa Hian's arrival in the reign of\r\nKisti-Sri-Megha-warna, A.D. 311, in charge of a princess of Kalinga, who\r\nconcealed it in the folds of her hair. And the _Mahawanso_ with equal\r\nprecision describes the procession as conducted by the king and by the\r\nassembled priests, in which the tooth was borne along the streets of\r\nAnarajapoora amidst the veneration of the multitude.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It was whilst looking at this statue that FA HIAN\r\nencountered an incident which he has related with touching\r\nsimplicity:--\"Depuis que FA HIAN avait quitté la _terre de Han_,\r\nplusieurs années s'étaient écoulées; les gens avec lesquels il avait des\r\nrapports étaient tous des hommes de contrées étrangères. Les montagnes,\r\nles rivières, les herbes, les arbres, tout ce qui avait frappé ses yeux\r\nétait nouveau pour lui. De plus, ceux qui avaient fait route avec lui,\r\ns'en étaient séparés, les uns s'étant arrêtés, et les autres étant\r\nmorts. En réfléchissant au passé, son coeur était toujours rempli de\r\npensées et de tristesse. Tout à coup, à cóté de cette figure de jaspe,\r\nil vit un marchand qui faisait hommage à la statue d'un éventail de\r\ntaffetas blanc du pays de _Tsin_. Sans qu'en s'en aperçût cela lui causa\r\nune émotion telle que ses larmes coulèrent et remplirent ses yeux.\" (FA\r\nHIAN, _Fo[)e] Kou[)e] Ki_, ch. xxxviii. p. 333.) \"Tsin\" means the\r\nprovince of Chensi, which was the birthplace of Fa Hian.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: FA HIAN, _Fo[)e] Kou[)e] Ki_, ch. xxxviii. p. 334-5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxvii. p. 241, 249. After the funeral\r\nrites of Gotama Buddha had been performed at Kusinara, B.C. 543, his\r\n\"left canine tooth\" was carried to Dantapura, the capital of Kalinga,\r\nwhere it was preserved for 800 years. The King of Calinga, in the reign\r\nof Maha-Sen, being on the point of engaging in a doubtful conflict,\r\ndirected, in the event of defeat, that the sacred relic should be\r\nconveyed to Ceylon, whither it was accordingly taken as described.\r\n(_Rajavali_, p. 240.) Between A.D. 1303 and 1315 the tooth was carried\r\nback to Southern India by the leader of an army, who invaded Ceylon and\r\nsacked _Yapahoo_, which was then the capital. The succeeding monarch,\r\nPrakrama III., went in person to Madura to negotiate its surrender, and\r\nbrought it back to Pollanarrua. Its subsequent adventures and its final\r\ndestruction by the Portuguese, as recorded by DE COUTO and others, will\r\nbe found in a subsequent passage, see Vol. II. P. VII. ch. v. The\r\nSinghalese maintain that the Dalada, still treasured in its strong tower\r\nat Kandy, is the genuine relic, which was preserved from the Portuguese\r\nspoilers by secreting it at Delgamoa in Saffragam.\r\n\r\nTURNOUR'S _Account of the Tooth Relic of Ceylon; Journal of the Asiatic\r\nSociety of Bengal_, 1837, vol. vi. p. 2, p. 856.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 459.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking events in this period of Singhalese history was\r\nthe murder of the king, Dhatu Sena, A.D. 459, by his son, who seized the\r\nthrone under the title of Kasyapa I. The story of this outrage, which is\r\nhighly illustrative of the superstition and cruelty of the age, is told\r\nwith much feeling in the _Mahawanso_; the author of which, Mahanamo, was\r\nthe uncle of the outraged king, Dhatu Sena was a descendant of the royal\r\nline, whose family were living in retirement during the usurpation of\r\nthe Malabars, A.D. 434 to 459. As a youth he had embraced the\r\npriesthood, and his future eminence was foretold by an omen. \"On a\r\ncertain day, when chaunting at the foot of a tree, when a shower of rain\r\nfell, a cobra de capello encircled him with its folds and covered his\r\nbook with its hood.\"[1] He was educated by his uncle, Mahanamo, and in\r\nprocess of time, surrounding himself with adherents, he successfully\r\nattacked the Malabars, defeated two of their chiefs in succession, put\r\nthree others to death, recovered the native sovereignty of Ceylon, \"and\r\nthe religion which had been set aside by the foreigners, he restored to\r\nits former ascendancy.\" He recalled the fugitive inhabitants to\r\nAnarajapoora; degraded the nobles who had intermarried with the\r\nMalabars, and vigorously addressed himself to repair the sacred edifices\r\nand to restore fertility to the lands which had been neglected during\r\ntheir hostile occupation by the strangers. He applied the jewels from\r\nhis head-dress to replace the gems of which the statue of Buddha had\r\nbeen despoiled. The curled hair of the divine teacher was represented by\r\nsapphires, and the lock on his forehead by threads of gold.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This is a frequent traditionary episode in connection with\r\nthe heroes of Hindu history.--_Asiat. Researches_, vol. xv. p. 275.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 459.]\r\n\r\nThe family of the king consisted of two sons and a daughter, the latter\r\nmarried to his nephew, who \"caused her to be flogged on the thighs with\r\na whip although she had committed no offence;\" on which the king, in his\r\nindignation, ordered the mother of her husband to be burned. His nephew\r\nand eldest son now conspired to dethrone him, and having made him a\r\nprisoner, the latter \"raised the chatta\" (the white parasol emblematic\r\nof royalty), and seized on the supreme power. Pressed by his son to\r\ndiscover the depository of his treasures, the captive king entreated to\r\nbe taken to Kalawapi, under the pretence of pointing out the place of\r\ntheir concealment, but in reality with a determination to prepare for\r\ndeath, after having seen his early friend Mahanamo, and bathed in the\r\ngreat tank which he himself had formerly constructed. The usurper\r\ncomplied, and assigned for the journey a \"carriage with broken wheels,\"\r\nthe charioteer of which shared his store of \"parched rice\" with the\r\nfallen king. \"Thus worldly prosperity,\" says Mahanamo, who lived to\r\nwrite the sad story of the interview, \"is like the glimmering of\r\nlightning, and what reflecting man would devote himself to its pursuit!\"\r\nThe Raja approached his friend and, \"from the manner these two persons\r\ndiscoursed, side by side, mutually quenching the fire of their\r\nafflictions, they appeared as if endowed with royal prosperity. Having\r\nallowed him to eat, the thero (Mahanamo) in various ways administered\r\nconsolation and abstracted his mind from all desire to prolong his\r\nexistence.\" The king then bathed in the tank; and pointing to his friend\r\nand to it, \"these,\" he exclaimed to the messengers, \"are all the\r\ntreasures I possess.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 477.]\r\n\r\nHe was conducted back to the capital; and Kasyapa, suspecting that the\r\nking was concealing his riches for his second son, Mogallana, gave the\r\norder for his execution. Arrayed in royal insignia, he repaired to the\r\nprison of the raja, and continued to walk to and fro in his presence:\r\ntill the king, perceiving his intention to wound his feelings, said\r\nmildly, \"Lord of statesmen, I bear the same affection towards you as to\r\nMogallana.\" The usurper smiled and shook his head; then stripping the\r\nking naked and casting him into chains, he built up a wall, embedding\r\nhim in it with his face towards the east, and enclosed it with clay:\r\n\"thus the monarch Dhatu-Sena, who was murdered by his son, united\r\nhimself with Sakko the ruler of Devos.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxviii. To this hideous incident Mahanamo\r\nadds the following curious moral: \"This Raja Dhatu Sena, at the time he\r\nwas improving the Kalawapi tank, observed a certain priest absorbed in\r\nmeditation, and not being able to rouse him from abstraction, had him\r\nburied under the embankment by heaping earth over him. His own living\r\nentombment _was the retribution_ manifested in this life for that\r\nimpious act.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 477.]\r\n\r\nThe parricide next directed his groom and his cook to assassinate his\r\nbrother, who, however, escaped to the coast of India.[1] Failing in the\r\nattempt, he repaired to Sihagiri, a place difficult of access to men,\r\nand having cleared it on all sides, he surrounded it with a rampart. He\r\nbuilt three habitations, accessible only by flights of steps, and\r\nornamented with figures of lions (siho), whence the fortress takes its\r\nname, _Siha-giri_, \"the Lion Rock.\" Hither he carried the treasures of\r\nhis father, and here he built a palace, \"equal in beauty to the\r\ncelestial mansion.\" He erected temples to Buddha, and monasteries for\r\nhis priests, but conscious of the enormity of his crimes, these\r\nendowments were conferred in the names of his minister and his children.\r\nFailing to \"derive merit\" from such acts, stung with remorse, and\r\nanxious to test public feeling, he enlarged his deeds of charity; he\r\nformed gardens at the capital, and planted groves of mangoes throughout\r\nthe island. Desirous to enrich a wihara at Anarajapoora, he proposed to\r\nendow it with a village, but \"the ministers of religion, regardful of\r\nthe reproaches of the world, declined accepting gifts at the hands of a\r\nparricide. Kasyapa, bent on befriending them, dedicated the village to\r\nBuddha, after which they consented, _on the ground that it was then the\r\nproperty of the divine teacher_.\" Impelled, says the _Mahawanso_, by the\r\nirrepressible dread of a future existence, he strictly performed his\r\n\"aposaka\"[2] vows, practised the virtue of non-procrastination, acquired\r\nthe \"dathanga,\"[3] and caused books to be written, and image and\r\nalms-edifices to be formed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: I am indebted to the family of the late Mr. Turnour for\r\naccess to a manuscript translation of a further portion of the\r\n_Mahawanso_, from which this continuation of the narrative is\r\nextracted.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A lay devotee who takes on himself the obligation of\r\nasceticism without putting on the yellow robe.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The dathanga or \"teles-dathanga\" are the thirteen\r\nordinances by which the cleaving to existence is destroyed, involving\r\npiety, abstinence, and self-mortification.--HARDY'S _Eastern Monachism_,\r\nch. ii. p. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORTIFIED ROCK OF SIGIRI]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 495.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, after an interval of eighteen years, Mogallana, having in his\r\nexile collected a sufficient force, returned from India to avenge the\r\nmurder of his father; and the brothers encountered each other in a\r\ndecisive engagement at Ambatthakolo in the Seven Corles. Kasyapa,\r\nperceiving a swamp in his front, turned the elephant which he rode into\r\na side path to avoid it; on which his army in alarm raised the shout\r\nthat \"their liege lord was flying,\" and in the confusion which followed,\r\nMogallana, having struck off the head of his brother, returned the krese\r\nto its scabbard, and led his followers to take possession of the\r\ncapital; where he avenged the death of his father, by the execution of\r\nthe minister who had consented to it. He established a marine force to\r\nguard the island against the descents of the Malabars, and \"having\r\npurified both the orthodox dharma[1], and the religion of the\r\nvanquisher, he died, after reigning eighteen years, signalised by acts\r\nof piety.\"[2] This story as related by its eye-witness, Mahanamo, forms\r\none of the most characteristic, as well as the best authenticated\r\nepisodes of contemporary history presented by the annals of Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The doctrines of Buddha.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxix. Manuscript translation by TURNOUR.\r\nTURNOUR, in his _Epitome_, says Kasyapa \"committed suicide on the field\r\nof battle,\" but this does not appear from the narrative of the\r\n_Mahawanso_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 515.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the feebleness of the royal house, that of the eight kings who\r\nsucceeded Mogallana between A.D. 515 and A.D. 586, two died by suicide,\r\nthree by murder, and one from grief occasioned by the treason of his\r\nson. The anarchy consequent upon such disorganisation stimulated the\r\nrapacity of the Malabars; and the chronicles of the following centuries\r\nare filled with the accounts of their descents on the island and the\r\nmisery inflicted by their excesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\nTHE DOMINATION OF THE MALABARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 515.]\r\n\r\nIt has been already explained that the invaders who engaged in forays\r\ninto Ceylon, though known by the general epithet of Malabars (or as they\r\nare designated in Pali, _damilos_, \"Tamils\"), were also natives of\r\nplaces in India remote from that now known as Malabar. They were, in\r\nreality, the inhabitants of one of the earliest states organised in\r\nSouthern India, the kingdom of Pandya[1], whose sovereigns, from their\r\nintelligence, and their encouragement of native literature, have been\r\nappropriately styled \"the Ptolemies of India.\" Their dominions, which\r\ncovered the extremity of the peninsula, comprehended the greater portion\r\nof the Coromandel coast, extending to Canara on the western coast, and\r\nsouthwards to the sea.[2] Their kingdom was subsequently contracted in\r\ndimensions, by the successive independence of Malabar, the rise of the\r\nstate of Chera to the west, of Ramnad to the south, and of Chola in the\r\neast, till it sank in modern times into the petty government of the\r\nNaicks of Madura.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pandya, as a kingdom was not unknown in classical times,\r\nand its ruler was the [Greek: Basileus Pandiôn] mentioned in the\r\n_Periplus of the Erythræan Sea_, and the king Pandion, who sent an\r\nembassy to Augustus.--PLINY, vi. 26; PTOLEMY, vii. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See an _Historical Sketch of the Kingdom of Pandya_, by\r\nProf. H. H. WILSON, _Asiat. Journ._, vol. iii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See _ante_, p. 353, n.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 515.]\r\n\r\nThe relation between this portion of the Dekkan and the early colonisers\r\nof Ceylon was rendered intimate by many concurring incidents. Wijayo\r\nhimself was connected by maternal descent with the king of Kalinga[1],\r\nnow known as the Northern Circars; his second wife was the daughter of\r\nthe king of Pandya, and the ladies who accompanied her to Ceylon were\r\ngiven in marriage to his ministers and officers.[2] Similar alliances\r\nwere afterwards frequent; and the Singhalese annalists allude on more\r\nthan one occasion to the \"damilo consorts\" of their sovereigns.[3]\r\nIntimate intercourse and consanguinity, were thus established from the\r\nremotest period. Adventurers from the opposite coast were encouraged by\r\nthe previous settlers; high employments were thrown open to them,\r\nMalabars were subsidised both as cavalry and as seamen; and the first\r\nabuse of their privileges was in the instance of the brothers Sena and\r\nGoottika, who, holding naval and military commands, took advantage of\r\ntheir position and seized on the throne, B.C. 237; apparently with such\r\nacquiescence on the part of the people, that even the _Mahawanso_\r\npraises the righteousness of their reign, which was prolonged to\r\ntwenty-two years, when they were put to death by the rightful heir to\r\nthe throne.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. vi. p. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. vii. p. 53; the _Rajarali_ (p. 173) says\r\nthey were 700 in number.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxviii. p. 253.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Mahawanso_ ch. xxi. p. 127.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 515.]\r\n\r\nThe easy success of the first usurpers encouraged the ambition of fresh\r\naspirants, and barely ten years elapsed till the _first_ regular\r\ninvasion of the island took place, under the illustrious Elala, who,\r\nwith an army from Mysore (then called Chola or Soli), subdued the entire\r\nof Ceylon, north of the Mahawelli-ganga, and compelled the chiefs of the\r\nrest of the island, and the kings of Rohuna and Maya, to acknowledge his\r\nsupremacy and become his tributaries.[1] As in the instance of the\r\nprevious revolt, the people exhibited such faint resistance to the\r\nusurpation, that the reign of Elala extended to forty-four years. It is\r\ndifficult to conceive that their quiescence under a stranger was\r\nentirely ascribable to the fact, that the rule of the Malabars, although\r\nadverse to Buddhism, was characterised by justice and impartiality.\r\nPossibly they recognised to some extent their pretensions, as founded on\r\ntheir relationship to the legitimate sovereigns of the island, and hence\r\nthey bore their sway without impatience.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, p. 17; _Mahawanso_, ch. xxi. p. 128;\r\n_Rajavali_, p. 188.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See _ante_, p. 360, n.]\r\n\r\nThe majority of the subsequent invasions of Ceylon by the Malabars\r\npartook less of the character of conquest than of forays, by a restless\r\nand energetic race, into a fertile and defenceless country. Mantotte, on\r\nthe northwest coast, near Adam's Bridge, became the great place of\r\ndebarcation; and here successive bands of marauders landed time after\r\ntime without meeting any effectual resistance from the unwarlike\r\nSinghalese.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ great invasion took place about a century after the first,\r\nB.C. 103, when seven Malabar leaders effected simultaneous descents at\r\ndifferent points of the coast[1], and combined with a disaffected\r\n\"Brahman prince\" of Rohuna, to force Walagam-bahu I. to surrender his\r\nsovereignty. The king, after an ineffectual show of resistance, fled to\r\nthe mountains of Malaya; one of the invaders carried off the queen to\r\nthe coast of India; a third despoiled the temples of Anarajapoora and\r\nretired, whilst the others continued in possession of the capital for\r\nnearly fifteen years, till Walagam-bahu, by the aid of the Rohuna\r\nhighlanders, succeeded in recovering the throne.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, p. 16. The _Mahawanso_ says they\r\nlanded at \"Mahatittha.\"--_Mantotte_, ch. xxxiii. p. 203.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 515.]\r\n\r\nThe _third_ great invasion on record[1] was in its character still more\r\npredatory than those which preceded it, but it was headed by a king in\r\nperson, who carried away 12,000 Singhalese as slaves to Mysore. It\r\noccurred in the reign of Waknais, A.D. 110, whose son Gaja-bahu, A.D.\r\n113, avenged the outrage by invading the Solee country with an\r\nexpedition which sailed from Jaffnapatam, and brought back not only the\r\nrescued Singhalese captives, but also a multitude of Solleans, whom the\r\nking established on lands in the Alootcoor Corle, where the Malabar\r\nfeatures are thought to be discernible to the present day.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This incursion of the Malabars is not mentioned in the\r\n_Mahawanso_, but it is described in the _Rajavali_, p. 229, and\r\nmentioned by TURNOUR, in his _Epitome_, &c., p. 21. There is evidence of\r\nthe conscious supremacy of the Malabars over the north of Ceylon, in the\r\nfourth century, in a very curious document, relating to that period. The\r\nexistence of a colony of Jews at Cochin, in the southwestern extremity\r\nof the Dekkan, has long been known in Europe, and half a century ago,\r\nparticulars of their condition and numbers were published by Dr.\r\nClaudius Buchanan. (_Christian Researches, &c._) Amongst other facts, he\r\nmade known their possession of Hebrew MSS. demonstrative of the great\r\nantiquity of their settlement in India, and also of their title deeds of\r\nland (_sasanams_), engraved on plates of copper, and presented to them\r\nby the early kings of that portion of the peninsula. Some of the latter\r\nhave been carefully translated into English (see _Madras Journ._, vol.\r\nxiii. xiv.). One of their MSS. has recently been brought to England,\r\nunder circumstances which are recounted by Mr. FORSTER, in the third\r\nvol. of his _One Primeval Language_, p. 303. This MS. I have been\r\npermitted to examine. It is in corrupted Rabbinical Hebrew, written\r\nabout the year 1781, and contains a partial synopsis of the modern\r\nhistory of the section of the Jewish nation to whom it belongs; with\r\naccounts of their arrival in the year A.D. 68, and of their reception by\r\nthe Malabar kings. Of one of the latter, frequently spoken of by the\r\nhonorific style of SRI PERUMAL, but identifiable with IRAVI VARMAR, who\r\nreigned A.D. 379, the manuscript says that his \"_rule extended from Goa\r\nto Colombo_.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: CASTE CHITTY, _Ceylon Gazetteer_, p. 7.]\r\n\r\nA long interval of repose followed, and no fresh expedition from India\r\nis mentioned in the chronicles of Ceylon till A.D. 433, when the capital\r\nwas again taken by the Malabars; the Singhalese families fled beyond the\r\nMahawelli-ganga; and the invaders occupied the entire extent of the\r\nPihiti Ratta, where for twenty-seven years, five of them in succession\r\nadministered the government, till Dhatu Sena collected forces sufficient\r\nto overpower the strangers, and, emerging from his retreat in Rohuna,\r\nrecovered possession of the north of the island.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajavali_, p. 243; TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, p. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 515.]\r\n\r\nDhatu Sena, after his victory, seems to have made an attempt, though an\r\nineffectual one, to reverse the policy which had operated under his\r\npredecessors as an incentive to the immigration of Malabars; settlement\r\nand intermarriages had been all along encouraged[1], and even during the\r\nrecent usurpation, many Singhalese families of rank had formed\r\nconnections with the Damilos. The schisms among the Buddhist themselves,\r\ntending as they did to engraft Brahmanical rites upon the doctrines of\r\nthe purer faith, seem to have promoted and matured the intimacy between\r\nthe two people; some of the Singhalese kings erected temples to the gods\r\nof the Hindus[2], and the promoters of the Wytulian heresy found a\r\nrefuge from persecution amongst their sympathisers in the Dekkan.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Anula, the queen of Ceylon, A.D. 47, met with no opposition\r\nin raising one of her Malabar husbands to the throne.--TURNOUR'S\r\n_Epitome_, p. 19.

Proud of these successful expeditions, the\r\nnative records of the Chola kings make mention of their victories; and\r\nin one of their grants of land, engraved on copper, and still in\r\nexistence, Viradeva-Chola, the sovereign by whom it was made, is\r\ndescribed as having triumphed over \"Madura, Izham, Caruvar, and the\r\ncrowned head of Pandyan;\" Izham, (or Ilám) being the Tamil name of\r\nCeylon.[2] On their expulsion by Dhatu Sena, he took possession of the\r\nfortresses and extirpated the Damilos; degraded the Singhalese who had\r\nintermarried with them; confiscated their estates in favour of those who\r\nhad remained true to his cause; and organised a naval force for the\r\nprotection of the coasts[3] of the island.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxvi. p. 238.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: DOWSON, on the Chera Kingdom of India.--_Asiat.

This account of the\r\nChinese voyager accords accurately with the events detailed in the\r\nSinghalese annals, in which it is stated that Sanghatissa was deposed\r\nand murdered, A.D. 623, by the Seneriwat, his minister, who, amidst the\r\nhorrors of a general famine, was put to death by the people of Rohuna,\r\nand a civil war ensued; one result of which was the defeat of the\r\nMalabar mercenaries and their distribution as slaves to the temples.\r\nHiouen Thsang relates the particulars of his interviews with the\r\nfugitives, from whom he learned the extraordinary riches of Ceylon, the\r\nnumber and wealth of its wiharas, the density of its population in\r\npeaceful times, the fertility of its soil, and the abundance of its\r\nproduce.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Histoire de la Vie de Hiouen Thsang, et de ses Voyages\r\ndans l'Inde depuis l'an_ 629 _jusquèn_ 643. _Par_ HOEI-LI _et_\r\nYEN-THSANG, _&c.

They filled every office, including\r\nthat of prime minister[1], and they decided the claims of competing\r\ncandidates for the crown. At length the island became so infested by\r\ntheir numbers that the feeble monarchs found it impracticable to effect\r\ntheir exclusion from Anarajapoora[2]; and to escape from their\r\nproximity, the kings in the eighth century began to move southwards, and\r\ntransferred their residence to Pollanarrua, which eventually became the\r\ncapital of the kingdom. Enormous tanks were constructed in the vicinity\r\nof the new capital; palaces were erected, surpassing those of the old\r\ncity in architectural beauty; dagobas were raised, nearly equal in\r\naltitude to the Thuparama and Ruanwelli, and temples and statues were\r\nhewn out of the living rock, the magnitude and beauty of whose ruins\r\nattest the former splendour of Pollanarrua.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, p. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, A.D. 686, p. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The first king who built a palace at Pollanarrua was Sri\r\nSanga Bo II., A.D. 642. His successor, Sri Sanga Bo III., took up his\r\nresidence there temporarily, A.D. 702; it was made the capital by Kuda\r\nAkbo, A.D. 769, and its embellishment, the building of colleges, and the\r\nformation of tanks in its vicinity, were the occupations of numbers of\r\nhis successors.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 640.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their numbers and their power, it is remarkable that the\r\nMalabars were never identified with any plan for promoting the\r\nprosperity and embellishment of Ceylon, or with any undertaking for the\r\npermanent improvement of the island. Unlike the Gangetic race, who were\r\nthe earliest colonists, and with whom originated every project for\r\nenriching and adorning the country, the Malabars aspired not to beautify\r\nor enrich, but to impoverish and deface;--and nothing can more\r\nstrikingly bespeak the inferiority of the southern race than the single\r\nfact that everything tending to exalt and to civilise, in the early\r\ncondition of Ceylon, was introduced by the northern conquerors, whilst\r\nall that contributed to ruin and debase it is distinctly traceable to\r\nthe presence and influence of the Malabars.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 840.]\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese, either paralysed by dread, made feeble efforts to rid\r\nthemselves of the invaders; or fascinated by their military pomp,\r\nendeavoured to conciliate them by alliances. Thus, when the king of\r\nPandya over-ran the north of Ceylon, A.D. 840, plundered the capital and\r\ndespoiled its temples, the unhappy sovereign had no other resource than\r\nto purchase the evacuation of the island by a heavy ransom.[1] Yet such\r\nwas the influence still exercised by the Malabars, that within a very\r\nfew years his successor on the throne lent his aid to the son of the\r\nsame king of Pandya in a war against his father, and conducted the\r\nexpedition in person.[2] His army was, in all probability, composed\r\nchiefly of Damilos, with whom he overran the south of the Indian\r\npeninsula, and avenged the outrage inflicted on his own kingdom in the\r\nlate reign by bearing back the plunder of Madura.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, p. 35; _Rajaratnacari_, p. 79.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A.D. 858; _Rajaratnacari_, p, 84.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 954.]\r\n\r\nThis exploit served to promote a more intimate intercourse between the\r\ntwo races, and after the lapse of a century, A.D. 954, the king of\r\nCeylon a second time interposed with an army to aid the Pandyan\r\nsovereign in a quarrel with his neighbour of Chola, wherein the former\r\nwas worsted, and forced to seek a refuge in the territory of his insular\r\nally, whence he was ultimately expelled for conspiracy against his\r\nbenefactor. Having fled to India without his regalia, his Cholian rival\r\nmade the refusal of the king of Ceylon to surrender them the pretext for\r\na fresh Malabar invasion, A.D. 990, when the enemy was repulsed by the\r\nmountaineers of Rohuna, who, from the earliest period down to the\r\npresent day, have evinced uniform impatience of strangers, and steady\r\ndetermination to resist their encroachments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 997.]\r\n\r\nBut such had been the influx of foreigners, that the efforts of these\r\nhighland patriots were powerless against their numbers. Mahindo III.,\r\nA.D. 997, married a princess of Calinga[1], and in a civil war which\r\nensued, during the reign of his son and successor, the novel spectacle\r\nwas presented of a Malabar army supporting the cause of the royal family\r\nagainst Singhalese insurgents. The island was now reduced to the extreme\r\nof anarchy and insecurity; \"the foreign population\" had increased to\r\nsuch an extent as to gain a complete ascendency over the native\r\ninhabitants, and the sovereign had lost authority over both.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Now the Northern Circars.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, p. 37.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1023.]\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 1023, the Cholians again invaded Ceylon[1], carried the king\r\ncaptive to the coast of India (where he died in exile), and established\r\na Malabar viceroy at Pollanarrua, who held possession of the island for\r\nnearly thirty years, protected in his usurpation by a foreign army.\r\nThus, \"throughout the reign of nineteen kings,\" says the _Rajaratnacari_\r\n\"extending over eighty-six years, the Malabars kept up a continual war\r\nwith the Singhalese, till they filled by degrees every village in the\r\nisland.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the reign of Mahindo IV.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajaratnacari_, p. 85.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1028.]\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of the rightful sovereign, and in the confusion which\r\nensued on his decease, various members of the royal family arrived at\r\nthe sovereignty of Rohuna, the only remnant of free territory left. Four\r\nbrothers, each assuming the title of king, contended together for\r\nsupremacy; and amidst anarchy and intrigue, each in turn took up the\r\nreins of government, as they fell or were snatched from the hands of his\r\npredecessor[1], till at length, on the retirement of all other\r\ncandidates, the forlorn crown was assumed by the minister Lokaiswara,\r\nwho held his court at Kattragam, and died A.D. 1071.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, p. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxi.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP XI.\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF PRAKRAMA BAHU.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1071.]\r\n\r\nFrom the midst of this gloom and despondency, with usurpation successful\r\nin the only province where even a semblance of patriotism survived, and\r\na foreign enemy universally dominant throughout the rest of Ceylon,\r\nthere suddenly arose a dynasty which delivered the island from the sway\r\nof the Malabars, brought back its ancient wealth and tranquillity, and\r\nfor the space of a century made it pre-eminently prosperous at home and\r\nvictorious in expeditions by which its rulers rendered it respected\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nThe founder of this new and vigorous race was a member of the exiled\r\nfamily, who, on the death of Lokaiswara, was raised to the throne under\r\nthe title of Wijayo Bahu.[1] Dissatisfied with the narrow limits of\r\nRohuna, he resolved on rescuing Pihiti from the usurping strangers; and,\r\nby the courage and loyalty of his mountaineers, he recovered the ancient\r\ncapitals from the Malabars, compelled the whole extent of the island to\r\nacknowledge his authority, reunited the several kingdoms of Ceylon under\r\none national banner, and, \"for the security of Lanka against foreign\r\ninvasion, placed trustworthy chiefs at the head of paid troops, and\r\nstationed them round the coast.\"[2] Thus signally successful at home,\r\nthe fame of his exploits \"extended over all Dambadiva[3], and\r\nambassadors arrived at his court from the sovereigns of India and Siam.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A.D. 1071.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. lix.; _Rajaranacari_, p. 58; _Rajavali_,\r\np. 251; TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, p. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: India Proper.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1126.]\r\n\r\nAs he died without heirs a contest arose about the succession, which\r\nthreatened again to dissever the unity of the kingdom by arraying Rohuna\r\nand the south against the brother of Wijayo Bahu, who had gained\r\npossession of Pollanarrua. But in this emergency the pretensions of all\r\nother claimants to the crown were overruled in favour of Prakrama, a\r\nprince of accomplishments and energy so unrivalled as to secure for him\r\nthe partiality of his kindred and the admiration of the people at large.\r\n\r\nHe was son to the youngest of four brothers who had recently contended\r\ntogether for the crown, and his ambition from childhood had been to\r\nrescue his country from foreign dominion, and consolidate the monarchy\r\nin his own person. He completed by foreign travel an education which,\r\naccording to the _Mahawanso_, comprised every science and accomplishment\r\nof the age in which he lived, including theology, medicine, and logic;\r\ngrammar, poetry, and music; the training of the elephant and the\r\nmanagement of the horse.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxiv.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1153.]\r\n\r\nOn the death of his father he was proclaimed king by the people, and a\r\nsummons was addressed by him to his surviving uncle, calling on him to\r\nresign in his favour and pay allegiance to his supremacy. As the feeling\r\nof the nation was with him, the issue of a civil war left him master of\r\nCeylon. He celebrated his coronation as King of Pihiti at Pollanarrua,\r\nA.D. 1153, and two years later after reducing the refractory chiefs of\r\nRohuna to obedience, he repeated the ceremonial by crowning himself\r\n\"sole King of Lanka.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxi.]\r\n\r\nThere is no name in Singhalese history which holds the same rank in the\r\nadmiration of the people as that of Prakrama Bahu, since to the piety of\r\nDevenipiatissa he united the chivalry of Dutugaimunu.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1155.]\r\n\r\nThe tranquillity insured by the independence and consolidation of his\r\ndominions he rendered subservient to the restoration of religion, the\r\nenrichment of his subjects, and the embellishment of the ancient\r\ncapitals of his kingdom; and, ill-satisfied with the inglorious ease\r\nwhich had contented his predecessors, he aspired to combine the renown\r\nof foreign conquests with the triumphs of domestic policy.\r\n\r\nFaithful to the two grand objects of royal solicitude, religion and\r\nagriculture, the earliest attention of Prakrama was directed to the\r\nre-establishment of the one, and the encouragement and extension of the\r\nother. He rebuilt the temples of Buddha, restored the monuments of\r\nreligion in more than their pristine splendour, and covered the face of\r\nthe kingdom with works for irrigation to an extent which would seem\r\nincredible did not their existing ruins corroborate the historical\r\nnarrative of his stupendous labours.\r\n\r\nSuch had been the ostensible decay of Buddhism during the Malabar\r\ndomination that, when the kingdom was recovered from them by Wijayo\r\nBahu, A.D. 1071, \"there was not to be found in the whole island five\r\ntirunansis,\" and an embassy was bent to Arramana[1] to request that\r\nmembers of this superior rank of the priesthood might be sent to restore\r\nthe order in Ceylon.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A part of the Chin-Indian peninsula, probably between\r\nArracan and Siam.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajaratnacari_, p. 85; _Rajavali_, p. 252; _Mahawanso_,\r\nch, lx.\r\n\r\nFrom the identity of the national faith in the two countries;\r\nintercourse existed between Siam and Ceylon from time immemorial. At a\r\nvery early period missions were interchanged for the inter-communication\r\nof Pali literature, and in later times, when, owing to the oppression of\r\nthe Malabars certain orders of the priesthood had become extinct in\r\nCeylon, it became essential to seek a renewal of ordination at the hands\r\nof the Siamese heirarchy (_Rajaratnacari_, p. 86). In the numerous\r\nincursions of the Malabars from Chola and Pandya, the literary treasures\r\nof Ceylon were deliberately destroyed, and the _Mahawanso_ and\r\n_Rajavali_, make frequent lamentations over the loss of the sacred\r\nbooks. (See also _Rajaratnacari_, pp 77, 95, 97.) At a still later\r\nperiod the savage Raja Singha who reigned between A.D. 1581 and 1592,\r\nand became a convert to Brahmanism, sought eagerly for Buddhistical\r\nbooks, and \"delighted in burning them in heaps as high as a coco-nut\r\ntree.\" These losses it was sought to repair by an embassy to Siam, sent\r\nby Kirti-Sri in A.D. 1753, when a copious supply was obtained of Burmese\r\nversions of Pali sacred literature.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1155.]\r\n\r\nDuring the same troublous times, schisms and heresy had combined to\r\nundermine the national belief, and hence one of the first cares of\r\nPrakrama Bahu was to weed out the perverted sects, and establish a\r\ncouncil for the settlement of the faith on debatable points.[1] Dagobas\r\nand statues of Buddha were multiplied without end during his reign, and\r\ntemples of every form were erected both at Pollanarrua and throughout\r\nthe breadth of the island. Halls for the reading of bana, image rooms,\r\nresidences for the priesthood, ambulance halls and rest houses for their\r\naccommodation when on journeys, were built in every district, and rocks\r\nwere hollowed into temples; one of which, at Pollanarrua, remains to the\r\npresent day with its images of Buddha; \"one in a sitting and another in\r\na lying posture,\" almost as described in the _Mahawanso_.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxvii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxii. For a description of this temple\r\nsee the account of Pollanarrua in the present work, Vol. II. Pt. x. ch.\r\ni.]\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the spirit of toleration, which is one of the\r\ncharacteristics of Buddhism, the king \"erected a house for the Brahmans\r\nof the capital to afford the comforts of religion even to his Malabar\r\nenemies.\" And mindful of the divine injunctions engraven on the rock by\r\nKing Asoca, \"he forbade the animals in the whole of Lanka, both of the\r\nearth and the water, to be killed,\"[1] and planted gardens, \"resembling\r\nthe paradise of the God-King Sakkraia, with trees of all sorts bearing\r\nfruits and odorous flowers.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxvii. Among the religious edifices\r\nconstructed by Prakrama Bahu in many parts of his kingdom, the\r\n_Mahawanso_, enumerates three temples at Pollanarrua, besides others at\r\nevery two or three gows distance; 101 dagobas, 476 statues of Buddha,\r\nand 300 image rooms built, besides 6100 repaired. He built for the\r\nreception of priests from a distance, \"230 lodging apartments, 50 halls\r\nfor preaching, and 9 for walking, 144 gates, and 192 rooms for the\r\npurpose of offering flowers. He built 12 apartments and 230 halls for\r\nthe use of strangers, and 31 rock temples, with tanks, baths, and\r\ngardens for the priesthood.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1155.]\r\n\r\nFor the people the king erected almonries at the four gates of the\r\ncapital, and hospitals, with slave boys and maidens to wait upon the\r\nsick, superintending them in person, and bringing his medical knowledge\r\nto assist in their direction and management.\r\n\r\nEven now the ruins of Pollanarrua, the most picturesque in Ceylon,\r\nattest the care which he lavished on his capital. He surrounded it with\r\nramparts, raised a fortress within them, and built a palace for his own\r\nresidence, containing four thousand apartments. He founded schools and\r\nlibraries; built halls for music and dancing; formed tanks for public\r\nbaths; opened streets, and surrounded the whole city with a wall which,\r\nif we are to credit the native chronicles, enclosed an area twelve miles\r\nbroad by nearly thirty in length.\r\n\r\nBy his liberality, Rohuna and Pihiti were equally embellished; the\r\nbuildings of Vigittapura and Sigiri were renewed; and the ancient\r\nedifices at Anarajapoora were restored, and its temples and palaces\r\nrepaired, under the personal superintendence of his minister. It is\r\nworthy of remark that so greatly had the constructive arts declined,\r\neven at that period, in Ceylon, that the king had to \"bring Damilo\r\nartificers\" from the opposite coast of India to repair the structures at\r\nhis capital.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxv. lxxvii.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1155.]\r\n\r\nThe details preserved in the Singhalese chronicles as to the works for\r\nirrigation which he formed or restored, afford an idea of the prodigious\r\nencouragement bestowed upon agriculture in this reign, as well as of the\r\nextent to which the rule of the Malabars had retarded the progress and\r\ndestroyed the earlier traces of civilisation. Fourteen hundred and\r\nseventy tanks were constructed by the king in various parts of the\r\nisland, three of them of such vast dimensions that they were known as\r\nthe \"Seas of Prakrama;\"[1] and in addition to these, three hundred\r\nothers were formed by him for the special benefit of the priests. The\r\n\"Great Lakes\" which he repaired, as specified in the _Mahawanso_, amount\r\nto thirteen hundred and ninety-five, and the smaller ones which he\r\nrestored or enlarged to nine hundred and sixty. Besides these, he made\r\nfive hundred and thirty-four watercourses and canals, by damming up the\r\nrivers, and repaired three thousand six hundred and twenty-one.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajaratnacari_, p. 88]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The useful ambition of signalising their reign by the\r\nconstruction of works of irrigation, is still exhibited by the Buddhist\r\nsovereigns of the East; and the king of Burmah in his interview with the\r\nBritish envoy in 1855, advanced his exploits of this nature as his\r\nhighest claim to distinction.

His\r\nfirst foreign expedition was fitted out to chastise the king of Cambodia\r\nand Arramana[1] in the Siamese peninsula, who had plundered merchants\r\nfrom Ceylon, visiting those countries to trade in elephants; he had\r\nlikewise intercepted a vessel which was carrying some Singhalese\r\nprincesses, had outraged Prakrama's ambassador, and had dismissed him\r\nmutilated and maimed. A fleet sailed on this service in the sixteenth\r\nyear of Prakrama's reign, he effected a landing in Arramana, vanquished\r\nthe king, and obtained full satisfaction.[2] He next directed his arms\r\nagainst the Pandyan king, for the countenance which that prince had\r\nuniformly given to the Malabar invaders of the island. He reduced Pandya\r\nand Chola, rendered their sovereigns his tributaries, and having founded\r\na city within the territory of the latter, and coined money in his own\r\nname, he returned in triumph to Ceylon.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See _ante_, p. 406, n.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: TURNOUR's _Epitome_, p. 41; _Mahawanso_, lxxiv.;\r\n_Rajaratnacari_, p. 87; _Rajavali_, p. 254.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxvi.

His family were unequal\r\nto sustain or extend the honours he had won, and his nephew[1], a pious\r\nvoluptuary, by whom he was succeeded, was killed in an intrigue with the\r\ndaughter of a herdsman whilst awaiting the result of an appeal to the\r\nBuddhist sovereign of Arramana to aid him in reforming religion. His\r\nmurderer, whom he had previously nominated his successor, himself fell\r\nby assassination. An heir to the throne was discovered amongst the\r\nSinghalese exiles on the coast of India[2], but death soon ended his\r\nbrief reign. His brother and his nephew in turn assumed the crown; both\r\nwere despatched by the Adigar, who, having allied himself with the royal\r\nfamily by marrying the widow of the great Prakrama, contrived to place\r\nher on the throne, under the title of Queen Leela-Wattee, A.D. 1197.\r\nWithin less than three years she was deposed by an usurper, and he being\r\nspeedily put to flight, another queen, Kalyana-Wattee, was placed at the\r\nhead of the kingdom. The next ill-fated sovereign, a baby of three\r\nmonths old, was speedily set aside by means of a hired force, and the\r\nfirst queen, Leela-Wattee, restored to the throne. But the same band who\r\nhad effected a revolution in her favour were prompt to repeat the\r\nexploit; she was a second time deposed, and a third time recalled by the\r\nintervention of foreign mercenaries.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Wijayo Bahu II., killed by Mihindo, A.D. 1187.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Kirti Nissanga, brought from Calinga, A.D. 1192.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Of the very rare examples now extant of Singhalese coins,\r\none of the most remarkable bears the name of Leela-Wattee.--_Numismatic\r\nChronicle, 1853.

Vaux,\r\n_Esq_., p. 126.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1211.]\r\n\r\nWithin thirty years from the decease of Prakrama Bahu, the kingdom was\r\nreduced to such an extremity of weakness by contentions amongst the\r\nroyal family, and by the excesses of their partisans, that the vigilant\r\nMalabars seized the opportunity to land with an army of 24,000 men,\r\nreconquered the whole of the island, and Magha, their leader, became\r\nking of Ceylon A.D. 1211.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajavali_, p. 256.]\r\n\r\nThe adventurers who invaded Ceylon on this occasion came not from Chola\r\nor Pandya, as before, but from Calinga, that portion of the Dekkan which\r\nnow forms the Northern Circars. Their domination was marked by more than\r\nordinary cruelty, and the _Mahawanso_ and _Rajaratnacari_ describe with\r\npainful elaboration the extinction of Buddhism, the overthrow of\r\ntemples, the ruin of dagobas, the expulsion of priests, and the\r\noccupation of their dwellings by Damilos, the outrage of castes, the\r\nviolation of property, and the torture of its possessors to extract the\r\ndisclosure of their treasures, \"till the whole island resembled a\r\ndwelling in flames or a house darkened by funeral rites.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxix.; _Rajaratnacari_, p. 93;\r\n_Rajavali_, p. 256.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1211.]\r\n\r\nOn all former occasions Rohuna and the South had been comparatively free\r\nfrom the actual presence of the enemy, but in this instance they\r\nestablished themselves at Mahagam[1], and thence to Jaffnapatam, every\r\nprovince in the island was brought under subjection to their rule.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajavali_, 257.]\r\n\r\nThe peninsula of Jaffna and the extremity of the island north of Adam's\r\nBridge, owing to its proximity to the Indian coast, was at all times the\r\ndistrict most infested by the Malabars. Jambukola, the modern\r\nColombogam, is the port which is rendered memorable in the _Mahawanso_\r\nby the departure of embassies and the arrival of relics from the\r\nBuddhist countries, and Mantotte, to the north of Manaar, was the\r\nlanding place of the innumerable expeditions which sailed from Chola and\r\nPandya for the subjugation of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe Tamils have a tradition that, prior to the Christian era, Jaffna was\r\ncolonised by Malabars, and that a Cholian prince assumed the government,\r\nA.D. 101,--a date which corresponds closely with the second Malabar\r\ninvasion recorded in the _Mahawanso_. Thence they extended their\r\nauthority over the adjacent country of the Wanny, as far south as\r\nMantotte and Manaar, \"fortified their frontiers and stationed wardens\r\nand watchers to protect themselves from invasion.\"[1] The successive\r\nbands of marauders arriving from the coast had thus on every occasion a\r\nbase for operations, and a strong force of sympathisers to cover their\r\nlanding; and from the inability of the Singhalese to offer an effectual\r\nresistance, those portions of the island were from a very early period\r\npractically abandoned to the Malabars, whose descendants at the present\r\nday form the great bulk of its population.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See a paper on the early History of Jaffna by S. CASIE\r\nCHITTY, _Journal of the Royal Asiat. Society of Ceylon, 1847_, p. 68.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1235.]\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of twenty years, Wijayo Bahu III., A.D. 1235,\r\ncollected as many Singhalese followers as enabled him to recover a\r\nportion of the kingdom, and establish himself in Maya, within which he\r\nbuilt a capital at Jambudronha or Dambedenia, fifty miles to the north\r\nof the present Colombo. The Malabars still retained possession of Pihiti\r\nand defended their frontier by a line of forts drawn across the island\r\nfrom Pollanarrua to Ooroototta on the western coast.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxx. lxxxii.; _Rajaratnacuri_, pp. 94,\r\n94; _Rajavali_, p.258.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1266.]\r\n\r\nThirty years later Pandita Prakrama Bahu III, A.D. 1266, effected a\r\nfurther dislodgment of the enemy in the north; but Ceylon, which\r\npossessed\r\n\r\n  \"The fatal gift of beauty, that became A funeral dower of present woes\r\n  and past,\"\r\n\r\nwas destined never again to be free from the evils of foreign invasion;\r\na new race of marauders from the Malayan peninsula were her next\r\nassailants[1]; and these were followed at no very long interval by a\r\nfresh expedition from the coast of India.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajavali_, pp. 256, 260. A second Malay landing is\r\nrecorded in the reign of Prakrama III., A.D. 1267.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxxii.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1303.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1319.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1347.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1410.]\r\n\r\nHaving learned by experience the exposure and insecurity of the\r\nsuccessive capitals, which had been built by former sovereigns in the\r\nlow lands, this king founded the city of Kandy, then called\r\nSiriwardanapura, amongst the mountains of Maya[1], to which he removed\r\nthe sacred _dalada_, and the other treasures of the crown. But such\r\nprecautions came too late: to use the simile of the native historian,\r\nthey were \"fencing the field whilst the oxen were within engaged in\r\ndevouring the corn.\"[2] The power of the Malabars had become so firmly\r\nrooted, and had so irresistibly extended itself, that, one after\r\nanother, each of the earlier capitals was abandoned to them, and the\r\nseat of government carried further towards the south. Pollanarrua had\r\nrisen into importance in the eighth and ninth centuries, when\r\nAnarajapoora was found to be no longer tenable against the strangers.\r\nDambedenia was next adopted, A.D. 1235 as a retreat from Pollanarrua;\r\nand this being deemed insecure, was exchanged, A.D. 1303, for Yapahu in\r\nthe Seven Corles. Here the Pandyan marauders followed in the rear of the\r\nretreating sovereign[3], surprised the new capital, and carried off the\r\ndalada relic to the coast of India. After its recovery Yapahu was\r\ndeserted, A.D. 1319. Kornegalle or Kurunaigalla, then called\r\nHastisailapoora and Gampola[4], still further to the south and more\r\ndeeply intrenched amongst the Kandyan mountains, were successively\r\nchosen for the royal residence, A.D. 1347. Thence the uneasy seat of\r\ngovernment was carried to Peradenia, close by Kandy, and its latest\r\nmigration, A.D. 1410, was to Jaya-wardana-pura, the modern Cotta, a few\r\nmiles east of Colombo.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajaratnacari_, p. 104; _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxxiii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajaratnacari_, p. 82.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: A.D. 1303.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Gampola or Gam-pala, _Ganga-siripura_, \"the beautiful city\r\nnear the river,\" is said in the _Rajaratnacari_ to have been built by\r\none of the brothers-in-law of Panduwaasa, B.C. 504.]\r\n\r\nSuch frequent removals are evidences of the alarm and despondency\r\nexcited by the forays and encroachments of the Malabars, who from their\r\nstronghold at Jaffna exercised undisputed dominion over the northern\r\ncoasts on both sides of the island, and, secure in the possession of the\r\ntwo ancient capitals, Anarajapoora and Pollanarrua, spread over the rich\r\nand productive plains of the north. To the present hour the population\r\nof the island retains the permanent traces of this alien occupation of\r\nthe ancient kingdom of Pihiti. The language of the north of the island,\r\nfrom Chilaw on the west coast to Batticaloa on the east, is chiefly, and\r\nin the majority of localities exclusively, Tamil; whilst to the south of\r\nthe Dederaoya and the Mahawelli-ganga, in the ancient divisions of\r\nRohuna and Maya, the vernacular is uniformly Singhalese.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1410.]\r\n\r\nOccasionally, after long periods of inaction, collisions took place; or\r\nthe Singhalese kings equipped expeditions against the north; but the\r\ncontest was unequal; and in spite of casual successes, \"the king of the\r\nCeylonese Malabars,\" as he is styled in the _Rajavali_, held his court\r\nat Jaffnapatam, and collected tribute from both the high and the low\r\ncountries, whilst the south of the island was subdivided into a variety\r\nof petty kingdoms, the chiefs of which, at Yapahu, at Kandy, at Gampola,\r\nat Matura, Mahagam, Matelle, and other places[1], acknowledged the\r\nnominal supremacy of the sovereign at Cotta, with whom, however, they\r\nwere necessarily involved in territorial quarrels, and in hostilities\r\nprovoked by the withholding of tribute.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajavali_, p. 263; _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxxvii.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1410.]\r\n\r\nIt was during this period that an event occurred, which is obscurely\r\nalluded to in some of the Singhalese chronicles, but is recorded with\r\nsuch minute details in several of the Chinese historical works, as to\r\nafford a reliable illustration of the condition of the island and its\r\nmonarchy in the fifteenth century. Prior to that time the community of\r\nreligion between Ceylon and China, and the eagerness of the latter\r\ncountry to extend its commerce, led to the establishment of an\r\nintercourse which has been elsewhere described[1]; missions were\r\nconstantly despatched charged with an interchange of courtesies between\r\ntheir sovereigns; theologians and officers of state arrived in Ceylon\r\nempowered to collect information regarding the doctrines of Buddha; and\r\nenvoys were sent in return bearing royal donations of relics and sacred\r\nbooks. The Singhalese monarchs, overawed by the magnitude of the\r\nimperial power, were induced to avow towards China a sense of dependency\r\napproaching to homage; and the gifts which they offered are all recorded\r\nin the Chinese annals as so many \"payments of tribute.\" At length, in\r\nthe year 1405 A.D,[2], during the reign of the emperor Yung-lo[3] of the\r\nMing dynasty, a celebrated Chinese commander, Ching-Ho, having visited\r\nCeylon as the bearer of incense and offerings, to be deposited at the\r\nshrine of Buddha, was waylaid, together with his followers, by the\r\nSinghalese king, Wijayo Bahu VI., and with difficulty effected an escape\r\nto his ships. To revenge this treacherous affront Ching-Ho was\r\ndespatched a few years afterwards with a considerable fleet and a\r\nformidable military force, which the king (whom the Chinese historian\r\ncalls A-lee-ko-nae-wih) prepared to resist; but by a vigorous effort Ho\r\nand his followers succeeded in seizing the capital, and bore off the\r\nsovereign, together with his family, as prisoners to China. He presented\r\nthem to the emperor, who, out of compassion, ordered them to be sent\r\nback to their country on the condition that \"the wisest of the family\r\nshould be chosen king.\" \"_Seay-pa-nea-na_\"[4] was accordingly elected,\r\nand this choice being confirmed, he was sent to his native country, duly\r\nprovided with a seal of investiture, as a vassal of the empire under the\r\nstyle of Sri Prakrama Bahu VI.,--and from that period till the reign of\r\nTeen-shun, A.D. 1434-1448, Ceylon continued to pay an annual tribute to\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Part v. ch. iii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The narrative in the text is extracted from the\r\n_Ta-tsing-yi-tung_, a \"Topographical Account of the Manchoo Empire,\"\r\nwritten in the seventeenth century, to a copy of which, in the British\r\nMuseum, my attention was directed by the erudite Chinese scholar, Mr.\r\nMEADOWS, author of \"_The Chinese and their Rebellions_.\" The story of\r\nthis Chinese expedition to Ceylon will also be found in the\r\n_Se-yih-ké-foo-choo_, \"A Description of Western Countries,\" A.D. 1450;\r\nthe _Woo heo-pecu_, \"A Record of the Ming Dynasty,\" A.D. 1522, b. lviii.\r\np. 3, and in the _Ming-she_, \"A History of the Ming Dynasty,\" A.D. 1739,\r\ncccxxvi. p. 2.

Even when\r\ntemporarily subdued, they remained with forced professions of loyalty;\r\nDamilo soldiers were taken into pay by the Singhalese sovereigns; the\r\ndewales of the Hindu worship were built in close contiguity to the\r\nwiharas of Buddhism, and by frequent intermarriages the royal line was\r\nalmost as closely allied to the kings of Chola and Pandya as to the\r\nblood of the Suluwanse.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajavali_, p.261, 262. In A.D. 1187 on the death or\r\nMahindo V., the second in succession from the great Prakrama, the crown\r\ndevolved upon Kirti Nissanga, who was summoned from Calinga on the\r\nCoromandel Coast. On the extinction of the recognised line of Suluwanse\r\nin A.D. 1706, a prince from Madura, who was merely a connection by\r\nmarriage, succeeded to the throne. The King Raja Singha, who detained\r\nKnox in captivity, A.D. 1640, was married to a Malabar princess. In\r\nfact, the four last kings of Ceylon, prior to its surrender to Great\r\nBritain, were pure Malabars, without a trace of Singhalese blood.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 1505.]\r\n\r\nIt was in this state of exhaustion, that the Singhalese were brought\r\ninto contact with Europeans, during the reign of Dharma Prakrama IX,\r\nwhen the Portuguese, who had recently established themselves in India,\r\nappeared for the first time in Ceylon, A.D. 1505. The paramount\r\nsovereign was then living at Cotta; and the _Rajavali_ records the event\r\nin the following terms:--\"And now it came to pass that in the Christian\r\nyear 1522 A.D., in the month of April, a ship from Portugal arrived at\r\nColombo, and information was brought to the king, that there were in the\r\nharbour a race of very white and beautiful people, who wear boots and\r\nhats of iron, and never stop in one place. They eat a sort of white\r\nstone, and drink blood; and if they get a fish they give two or three\r\n_ridé_ in gold for it; and besides, they have guns with a noise louder\r\nthan thunder, and a ball shot from one of them, after traversing a\r\nleague, will break a castle of marble.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajavali_, Upham's version, p. 278.]\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to recount the intercourse of the islanders with these\r\ncivilised visitors, and the grave results which followed, it will be\r\nwell to cast a glance over the condition of the people during the period\r\nwhich preceded, and to cull from the native historians such notices of\r\ntheir domestic and social position as occur in passages intended by the\r\nSinghalese annalists to chronicle only those events which influenced the\r\nnational worship, or the exploits of those royal personages, who earned\r\nimmortality by their protection of Buddhism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSCIENCES AND SOCIAL ARTS\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nTHE ANCIENT SINGHALESE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nPOPULATION.--CASTE.--SLAVERY AND RAJA-KARIYA.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULATION.--In no single instance do the chronicles of Ceylon mention\r\nthe precise amount of the population of the island, at any particular\r\nperiod; but there is a sufficiency of evidence, both historical and\r\nphysical, to show that it must have been prodigious and dense,\r\nespecially in the reigns of the more prosperous kings. Whatever limits\r\nto the increase of man artificial wants may interpose in a civilised\r\nstate and in ordinary climates are unknown in a tropical region, where\r\nclothing is an encumbrance, the smallest shelter a home, and sustenance\r\nsupplied by the bounty of the soil in almost spontaneous abundance.\r\nUnder such propitious circumstances, in the midst of a profusion of\r\nfruit-bearing-trees, and in a country replenished by a teeming harvest\r\ntwice, at least, in each year, with the least possible application of\r\nlabour; it may readily be conceived that the number of the people will\r\nbe adjusted mainly, if not entirely, by the extent of arable land.\r\n\r\nThe emotion of the traveller of the present time, as day after day he\r\ntraverses the northern portions of the island, and penetrates the deep\r\nforests of the interior, is one of unceasing astonishment at the\r\ninconceivable multitude of deserted tanks, the hollows of which are\r\nstill to be traced; and the innumerable embankments, overgrown with\r\ntimber, which indicate the sites of vast reservoirs that formerly\r\nfertilised districts now solitary and barren. Every such tank is the\r\nlandmark of one village at least, and such are the dimensions of some of\r\nthem that in proportion to their area, it is probable that hundreds of\r\nvillages may have been supported by a single one of these great inland\r\nlakes.\r\n\r\nThe labour necessary to construct one of these gigantic works for\r\nirrigation is in itself an evidence of local density of population; but\r\ntheir multiplication by successive kings, and the constantly recurring\r\nrecord of district after district brought under cultivation in each\r\nsuccessive reign[1], demonstrate the steady increase of inhabitants, and\r\nthe multitude of husbandmen whose combined and sustained toil was\r\nindispensable to keep these prodigious structures in productive\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The practice of recording the formation of tanks for\r\nirrigation by the sovereign is not confined to the chronicles of Ceylon.\r\nThe construction of similar works on the continent of India has been\r\ncommemorated in the same manner by the native historians. The memoirs of\r\nthe Rajas of Orissa show the number of tanks made and wells dug in every\r\nreign.]\r\n\r\nThe _Rajavali_ relates that in the year 1301 A.D. King Prakrama III, on\r\nthe eve of his death, reminded his sons, that having conquered the\r\nMalabars, he had united under one rule the three kingdoms of the island,\r\nPihiti with 450,000 villages, Rohuna with 770,000, and Maya with\r\n250,000.[1] A village in Ceylon, it must be observed, resembles a \"town\"\r\nin the phraseology of Scotland, where the smallest collection of houses,\r\nor even a single farmstead with its buildings is enough to justify the\r\nappellation. In the same manner, according to the sacred ordinances\r\nwhich regulate the conduct of the Buddhist priesthood, a \"solitary\r\nhouse, if there be people, must be regarded as a village,\"[2] and all\r\nbeyond it is the forest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajavali_ p. 262. A century later in the reign or\r\nPrakrama-Kotta, A.D. 1410, the _Rajaratnacari_ says, there then were\r\n256,000 villages in the province of Matura, 495,000 in that of Jaffna,\r\nand 790,000 in Oovah.--P. 112.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Hardy's _Eastern Monachism_, ch. xiii. p. 133.]\r\n\r\nEven assuming that the figures employed by the author of the _Rajavali_\r\npartake of the exaggeration common to all oriental narratives, no one\r\nwho has visited the regions now silent and deserted, once the homes of\r\nmillions, can hesitate to believe that when the island was in the zenith\r\nof its prosperity, the population of Ceylon must of necessity have been\r\nat least ten times as great as it is at the present day.\r\n\r\nThe same train of thought leads to a clearer conception of the means by\r\nwhich this dense population was preserved, through so many centuries, in\r\nspite of frequent revolutions and often recurring invasions; as well as\r\nof the causes which led to its ultimate disappearance, when intestine\r\ndecay had wasted the organisation on which the fabric of society rested.\r\n\r\nCultivation, as it existed in the north of Ceylon, was almost entirely\r\ndependent on the store of water preserved in each village tank; and it\r\ncould only be carried on by the combined labour of the whole local\r\ncommunity, applied in the first instance to collect and secure the\r\nrequisite supply for irrigation, and afterwards to distribute it to the\r\nrice lands, which were tilled by the united exertions of the\r\ninhabitants, amongst whom the crop was divided in due proportions. So\r\nindispensable were concord and union in such operations, that\r\ninjunctions for their maintenance were sometimes engraven on the rocks,\r\nas an inperishable exhortation, to forbearance and harmony.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See the inscription on the rock of Mihintala, A. D. 262,\r\nTURNOUR'S _Epitome_, Appendix, p. 90; and a similar one on a rock at\r\nPollanarrua, ibid., p, 92.]\r\n\r\nHence, in the recurring convulsions which overthrew successive\r\ndynasties, and transferred the crown to usurpers, with a facile\r\nrapidity, otherwise almost unintelligible, it is easy to comprehend that\r\nthe mass of the people had the strongest possible motives for passive\r\nsubmission, and were constrained to acquiescence by an instinctive dread\r\nof the fatal effects of prolonged commotion.\r\n\r\nIf interrupted in their industry, by the dread of such events, they\r\nretired till the storm had blown over, and returned, after each\r\ntemporary dispersion, to resume possession of the lands and their\r\nvillage tank.\r\n\r\nThe desolation which now reigns over the plains which the Singhalese\r\nformerly tilled, was precipitated by the reckless domination of the\r\nMalabars, in the fourteenth and following centuries. The destruction of\r\nreservoirs and tanks has been ascribed to defective construction, and to\r\nthe absence of spill-waters, and other facilities for discharging the\r\nsurplus-water, during the prevalence of excessive rains; but\r\nindependently of the fact that vast numbers of these tanks, though\r\nutterly deserted, remain, in this respect, almost uninjured to the\r\npresent day, we have the evidence of their own native historians, that\r\nfor upwards of fifteen centuries, the reservoirs, when duly attended to,\r\nsuccessfully defied all the dangers to be apprehended from inundation.\r\nTheir destruction and abandonment are ascribable, not so much to any\r\nengineering defect, as to the disruption of the village communities, by\r\nwhom they were so long maintained. The ruin of a reservoir, when\r\nneglected and permitted to fall into decay, was speedy and inevitable;\r\nand as the destruction of the village tank involved the flight of all\r\ndependent upon it, the water, once permitted to escape, carried\r\npestilence and miasma over the plains they had previously covered with\r\nplenty. After such a calamity any partial return of the villagers, even\r\nwhere it was not prevented by the dread of malaria, would have been\r\nimpracticable; for the obvious reason, that where the whole combined\r\nlabour of the community was not more than sufficient to carry on the\r\nwork of conservancy and cultivation, the diminished force of a few would\r\nhave been utterly unavailing, either to effect the reparation of the\r\nwatercourses, or to restore the system on which the culture of rice\r\ndepends. Thus the process of decay, instead of a gradual decline as in\r\nother countries, became sudden and utter desolation in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nFrom such traces as are perceptible in the story of the earliest\r\nimmigrants, it is obvious that in their domestic habits and civil life\r\nthey brought with them and perpetuated in Ceylon the same pursuits and\r\ntraits which characterised the Aryan races that had colonised the valley\r\nof the Ganges. The Singhalese Chronicles abound, like the ancient Vedas,\r\nwith allusions to agriculture and herds, to the breeding of cattle and\r\nthe culture of grain. They speak of village communities and of their\r\nsocial organisation, as purely patriarchal. Women were treated with\r\nrespect and deference; and as priestesses and queens they acquired a\r\nprominent place in the national esteem. Rich furniture was used in\r\ndwellings and costly textures for dress; but these were obtained from\r\nother nations, whose ships resorted to the island, whilst its\r\ninhabitants, averse to intercourse with foreigners, and ignorant of\r\nnavigation, held the pursuits of the merchant in no esteem.\r\n\r\n_Caste_.--Amongst the aboriginal inhabitants _caste_ appears to have\r\nbeen unknown, although after the arrival of Wijayo and his followers the\r\nsystem in all its minute subdivisions, and slavery, both domestic and\r\nprædial, prevailed throughout the island. The Buddhists, as dissenters,\r\nwho revolted against the arrogant pretensions of the Brahmans, embodied\r\nin their doctrines a protest against caste under any modification. But\r\neven after the conversion of the Singhalese to Buddhism, and their\r\nacceptance of the faith at the hands of Mahindo, caste as a national\r\ninstitution was found too obstinately established to be overthrown by\r\nthe Buddhist priesthood; and reinforced, as its supporters were, by\r\nsubsequent intercourse with the Malabars, it has been perpetuated to the\r\npresent time, as a conventional and social, though no longer as a sacred\r\ninstitution. Practically, the Singhalese ignore three of the great\r\nclasses, theoretically maintained by the Hindus; among them there are\r\nneither Brahmans, Vaisyas, nor Kshastryas; and at the head of the class\r\nwhich they retain, they place the _Goi-wanse_ or _Vellalas_, nominally\r\n\"tillers of the soil.\" In earlier times the institution seems to have\r\nbeen recognised in its entirety, and in the glowing description given in\r\nthe _Mahawanso_ of the planting of the great Bo-tree, \"the sovereign the\r\nlord of chariots directed that it should be lifted by the four high\r\ncaste tribes and by eight persons of each of the other castes.\"[1] In\r\nlater times the higher ranks are seldom spoken of in the historical\r\nbooks but by specific titles, but frequent allusion is made to the\r\nChandalas, the lowest of all, who were degraded to the office of\r\nscavengers and carriers of corpses.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xix. p. 116.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Ibit., ch. x. p. 66. The Chandala in one of the Jatakas is\r\nrepresented as \"one born in the open air, his parents not being\r\npossessed of a roof; and as he lies amongst the pots when his mother\r\ngoes to cut fire-wood, he is suckled by the bitch along with her\r\npups.\"--HARDY'S _Buddhism_, ch. iii. p. 80.]\r\n\r\n_Slavery_.--The existence of slavery is repeatedly referred to, and in\r\nthe absence of any specific allusion to its origin in Ceylon, it must be\r\npresumed to have been borrowed from India. As the Sudras, according to\r\nthe institutes of Menu, were by the laws of caste consigned to helpless\r\nbondage, so slavery in Ceylon was an attribute of race[1]; and those\r\ncondemned to it were doomed to toil from their birth, with no requital\r\nother than the obligation on the part of their masters to maintain them\r\nin health, to succour them in sickness, and apportion their burdens to\r\ntheir strength.[2] And although the liberality of theoretical Buddhism\r\nthrew open, even to the lowest caste, all the privileges of the\r\npriesthood, the slave alone was repulsed, on the ground that his\r\nadmission would deprive the owner of his services.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In later times, slavery was not confined to the low castes;\r\ninsolvents could be made slaves by their creditors--the chief frequently\r\nbuying the debt, and attaching the debtor to his followers. The children\r\nof freemen, by female slaves, followed the status of their mothers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: HARDY'S _Buddhism_, ch. x. p. 482.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: HARDY'S _Eastern Monachism_, ch. iv. p. 18.]\r\n\r\nLike other property, slaves could be possessed by the Buddhist\r\nmonasteries, and inscriptions, still existing upon the rocks of\r\nMihintala and Dambool, attest the capacity of the priests to receive\r\nthem as gifts, and to require that as slaves they should be exempted\r\nfrom taxation.\r\n\r\nUnrelaxed in its assertion of abstract right, but mitigated in the forms\r\nof its practical enforcement, slavery endured in Ceylon till\r\nextinguished by the fiat of the British Government in 1845.[1] In the\r\nnorthern and Tamil districts of the island, its characteristics differed\r\nconsiderably from its aspect in the south and amongst the Kandyan\r\nmountains. In the former, the slaves were employed in the labours of the\r\nfield and rewarded with a small proportion of the produce; but amongst\r\nthe pure Singhalese, slavery was domestic rather than prædial, and those\r\nborn to its duties were employed less as the servants, than as the suite\r\nof the Kandyan chiefs. Slaves swelled the train of their retainers on\r\nall occasions of display, and had certain domestic duties assigned to\r\nthem, amongst which was the carrying of fire-wood, and the laying out of\r\nthe corpse after death. The strongest proof of the general mildness of\r\ntheir treatment in all parts of the island, is derived from the fact,\r\nthat when in 1845, Lord Stanley, now the Earl of Derby, directed the\r\nfinal abolition of the system, slavery was extinguished in Ceylon\r\nwithout a claim for compensation on the part of the proprietors.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: An account of slavery in Ceylon, and the proceedings for\r\nits suppression, will be found in PRIDHAM'S _Ceylon_, vol. i. p. 223.]\r\n\r\n_Compulsory Labour_.--Another institution, to the influence and\r\noperation of which the country was indebted for the construction of the\r\nworks which diffused plenty throughout every region, was the system of\r\nRaja-kariya, by which the king had a right to employ, for public\r\npurposes, the compulsory labour of the inhabitants. To what extent this\r\nwas capable of exaction, or under what safeguards it was enforced in\r\nearly times, does not appear from the historical books. But on all\r\noccasions when tanks were to be formed, or canals cut for irrigation,\r\nthe _Mahawanso_ alludes--almost in words of course--to the application\r\nof Raja-kariya for their construction[1], the people being summoned to\r\nthe task by beat of drum.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The inscription engraven on the rock at Mihintala, amongst\r\nother regulations for enforcing the observance by the temple tenants of\r\nthe conditions on which their lands were held, declares that \"if a fault\r\nbe committed by any of the cultivators; the adequate fine shall be\r\nassessed according to usage; or in lieu thereof, the delinquent shall be\r\ndirected _to work at the lake_ in making an excavation not exceeding\r\nsixteen cubits in circumference and one cubit deep.\"-- TURNOUR'S\r\n_Epitome_, &c., Appendix, p. 87.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxv. p. 149.]\r\n\r\nThe only mention of the system which attracts particular attention, is\r\nthe honour awarded to the most pious of the kings, who, whilst\r\nmaintaining Raja-kariya as an institution, nevertheless stigmatised it\r\nas \"oppression\" when applied to non-productive objects; and on the\r\noccasion of erecting one of the most stupendous of the monuments\r\ndedicated to the national faith, felt that the merit of the act would be\r\nneutralised, were it to be accomplished by \"unrequited\" labour.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Ibid., ch. xxvii. pp. 163, 165. King Tissa, A. D. 201, in\r\nimitation of Dutugaimunu. caused the restorations of monuments at the\r\ncapital \"_to be made with paid labour_.\"--Ibid., ch. xxxvi. p. 226. See\r\nante Vol. I. Pt. III. ch. v. p. 357.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE.--IRRIGATION.--CATTLE AND CROPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE.--Prior to the arrival of the Bengalis, and even for some\r\ncenturies after the conquest of Wijayo, before the knowledge of\r\nagriculture had extended throughout the island, the inhabitants appear\r\nto have subsisted to a great extent by the chase.[1] Hunting the elk and\r\nthe boar was one of the amusements of the early princes; the \"Royal\r\nHuntsmen\" had a range of buildings erected for their residence at\r\nAnarajapoora, B.C. 504[2], and the laws of the chase generously forbade\r\nto shoot the deer except in flight.[3] Dogs were trained to assist in\r\nthe sport[4] and the oppressed aborigines, driven by their conquerors to\r\nthe forests of Rohuna and Maya, are the subjects of frequent\r\ncommendation in the pages of the _Mahawanso_, from their singular\r\nability in the use of the bow.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. x. p. 59; ch, xiv. p. 78; ch. xxiii. p.\r\n142. The hunting of the hare is mentioned 161 B.C. _Mahawanso_, ch.\r\nxxiii. p. 141.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Ibid., ch. x. p. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Ibid., ch. xiv. p. 78.

Rice was distributed by Kuweni to the followers of Wijayo,\r\nbut it was \"rice procured from the wrecked ships of mariners.\"[l] And\r\ntwo centuries later, so scanty was the production of native grain, that\r\nAsoca, amongst the presents which he sent to his ally Devenipiatissa,\r\nincluded \"one hundred and sixty loads of hill paddi from Bengal.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. vii. p. 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Ibid., ch. xi. p. 70.]\r\n\r\nA Singhalese narrative of the \"Planting of the Bo-tree,\" an English\r\nversion of which will be found amongst the translations prepared for Sir\r\nAlexander Johnston, mentions the fact, that rice was still imported into\r\nCeylon from the Coromandel coast[1] in the second century before Christ.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: UPHAM, _Sacred Books of Ceylon,_ vol. iii. p. 231.]\r\n\r\n_Irrigation_.--It was to the Hindu kings who succeeded Wijayo, that\r\nCeylon was indebted for the earliest knowledge of agriculture, for the\r\nconstruction of reservoirs, and the practice of irrigation for the\r\ncultivation of rice.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A very able report on irrigation in some of the districts\r\nof Ceylon has been recently drawn up by Mr. BAILEY, of the Ceylon Civil\r\nService; but the author has been led into an error in supposing that,\r\n\"it cannot be to India that we must look for the origin of tanks and\r\ncanals in Ceylon,\" and that the knowledge of their construction was\r\nderived through \"the Arabian and Persian merchants who traded between\r\nEgypt and Ceylon.\" Mr. Bailey rests this conclusion on the assertion\r\nthat the first Indian canal of which we have any record dates no farther\r\nback than the middle of the fourteenth century. There was nothing in\r\ncommon between the shallow canals for distributing the periodical\r\ninundation of the Nile over the level lands of Egypt (a country in which\r\nrice was little known), and the gigantic embankments by which hills were\r\nso connected in Ceylon as to convert the valleys between them into\r\ninland lakes; and there was no similarity to render the excavation of\r\nthe one a model and precedent for the construction of the other.\r\nProbably the lake Moeris is what dwells in the mind of those who ascribe\r\nproficiency in irrigation to the ancient Egyptians; but although\r\nHerodotus asserts it to have been an excavation, _cheiropoiêtoz kai\r\noruktê_ (lib. ii. 149), geologic investigation has shown that Moeris is\r\na natural lake created by the local depression of that portion of the\r\nArsinoite nome. Neither Strabo nor Pliny, who believed it to be\r\nartificial, ascribed its origin to anything connected with irrigation,\r\nfor which, in fact, its level would render it unsuitable. Nature had\r\ndone so much for irrigation in Egypt, that art was forestalled; and even\r\nhad it been otherwise, and had the natives of that country been adepts\r\nin the science, or capable of teaching it, the least qualified imparters\r\nof engineering knowledge would have been the Arab and Persian mariners,\r\nwhose lives were spent in coasting the shores of the Indian Ocean. It is\r\ntrue that in Arabia itself, at a very early period, there is the\r\ntradition of the great artificial lake of Aram, in Yemen, about the time\r\nof Alexander the Great (SALE'S _Koran_, Introd. p.7); and evidence still\r\nmore authentic shows that the practice of artificial irrigation was one\r\nof the earliest occupations of the human race. The Scriptures; in\r\nenumerating the descendants of Shem, state that \"unto Eber were born two\r\nsons, and the name of one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was\r\ndivided.\" (_Genesis,_ ch. x. ver. 25.) In this passage according to\r\nCYRIL C. GRAHAM, the term _Peleg_ has a profounder meaning, and the\r\nsentence should have been translated--\"_for in his days the earth was\r\ncut into canals\" (Cambridge Essay_,1858.)\r\n\r\nBut historical testimony exists which removes all obscurity from the\r\ninquiry as to who were the instructors of the Singhalese. The most\r\nancient books of the Hindus show that the practice of canal-making was\r\nunderstood in India at as early a period as in Egypt. Canals are\r\nmentioned in the _Rayamana_, the story of which belongs to the dimmest\r\nantiquity; and when Baratha, the half-brother of Rama, was about to\r\nsearch for him in the Dekkan, his train is described as including\r\n\"labourers, with carts, bridge-builders, carpenters, and diggers of\r\ncanals.\" (_Ramayana_, CARY'S Trans., vol. iii. p. 228.) The _Mahawanso,_\r\nremoves all doubt as to the person by whom the Singhalese were\r\ninstructed in forming works for irrigation, by naming the Brahman\r\nengineer contemporary with the construction of the earliest tanks in the\r\nfourth century before the Christian era. (_Mahawanso_, ch. x.) Somewhat\r\nlater, B.C. 262, the inscription on the rock at Mihintala ascribes to\r\nthe Malabars the system of managing the water for the rice lands, and\r\ndirects that \"according to the supply of water in the lake, the same\r\nshall be distributed to the lands of the wihara _in the manner formerly\r\nregulated by the Tamils._\" (_Notes to_ TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, p. 90.) To\r\nbe convinced of the Tamil origin of the tank system which subsists to\r\nthe present day in Ceylon, it is only necessary to see the tanks of the\r\nSouthern Dekkan. The innumerable excavated reservoirs or _colams_ of\r\nCeylon will be found to correspond with the _culams_ of Mysore; and the\r\nvast _erays_ formed by drawing a bund to intercept the water flowing\r\nbetween two elevated ridges, exhibit the model which has been followed\r\nat Pathavie, Kandelai, Menery, and all the huge constructions of Ceylon,\r\nBut whoever may have been the original instructors of the Singhalese in\r\nthe formation of tanks, there seems every reason to believe that from\r\ntheir own subsequent experience, and the prodigious extent to which they\r\noccupied themselves in the formation of works of this kind, they\r\nattained a facility unsurpassed by the people of any other country. It\r\nis a curious circumstance in connection with this inquiry, that in the\r\neighth century after Christ, the King of Kashmir despatched messengers\r\nto Ceylon to bring back workmen, whom he employed in constructing an\r\nartificial lake. (_Raja-Tarangini_, Book iv. sl. 505.) If it were\r\nnecessary to search beyond India for the origin of cultivation in\r\nCeylon, the Singhalese, instead of borrowing a system from Egypt, might\r\nmore naturally have imitated the ingenious devices of their own\r\nco-religionists in China, where the system of irrigation as pursued in\r\nthe military colonies of that country has been a theme of admiration in\r\nevery age of their history. (See _Journal Asiatique,_ 1850, vol. lvi.\r\npp. 341, 346.) And as these colonies were planted not only in the centre\r\nof the empire but on its north-west extremities towards Kaschgar and the\r\nnorth-east of India, where the new settlers occupied themselves in\r\ndraining marshes and leading streams to water their arable lands, the\r\nprobabilities are that their system may have been known and copied by\r\nthe people of Hindustan.]\r\n\r\nThe first tank in Ceylon was formed by the successor of Wijayo, B.C.\r\n504, and their subsequent extension to an almost incredible number is\r\nascribable to the influence of the Buddhist religion, which, abhorring\r\nthe destruction of animal life, taught its multitudinous votaries to\r\nsubsist exclusively upon vegetable food. Hence the planting of gardens,\r\nthe diffusion of fruit-trees and leguminous vegetables[1], the sowing of\r\ndry grain[2], the formation of reservoirs and canals, and the\r\nreclamation of land \"in situations favourable for irrigation.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Beans, designated by the term of _Masá_ in the _Mahawanso_,\r\nwere grown in the second century before Christ, ch, xxiii. p, 140,]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The \"cultivation of a crop of hill rice\" is mentioned in\r\nthe _Mahawanso_ B.C. 77, ch. xxxiv. p. 208.]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to over-estimate the importance of this system of water\r\ncultivation, in a country like the north of Ceylon, subject to\r\nperiodical droughts. From physical and geological causes, the mode of\r\ncultivation in that section of the island differs essentially from that\r\npractised in the southern division; and whilst in the latter the\r\nfrequency of the rains and abundance of rivers afford a copious supply\r\nof water, the rest of the country is mainly dependent upon artificial\r\nirrigation, and on the quantity of rain collected in tanks; or of water\r\ndiverted from streams and directed into reservoirs.\r\n\r\nAs has been elsewhere[1] explained, the mountain ranges which tower\r\nalong the south-western coast, and extend far towards the eastern, serve\r\nin both monsoons to intercept the trade winds and condense the vapours\r\nwith which they are charged, thus ensuring to those regions a plentiful\r\nsupply of rain. Hence the harvests in those portions of the island are\r\nregulated by the two monsoons, the _yalla_ in May and the _maha_ in\r\nNovember; and seed-time is adjusted so as to take advantage of the\r\ncopious showers which fall at those periods.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Vol. I. Part I. ch. ii p. 67.]\r\n\r\nBut in the northern portions of Ceylon, owing to the absence of\r\nmountains, this natural resource cannot be relied on. The winds in both\r\nmonsoons traverse the island without parting with a sufficiency of\r\nmoisture; droughts are of frequent occurrence and of long continuance;\r\nand vegetation in the low and scarcely undulated plains is mainly\r\ndependent on dews and whatever damp is distributed by the steady\r\nsea-breeze. In some places the sandy soil rests upon beds of madrepore\r\nand coral rock, through which the scanty rain percolates too quickly to\r\nrefresh the soil; and the husbandman is entirely dependent upon wells\r\nand village tanks for the means of irrigation.\r\n\r\nIn a region exposed to such vicissitudes the risk would have been\r\nimminent and incessant, had the population been obliged to rely on\r\nsupplies of dry grain alone, the growth of which must necessarily have\r\nbeen precarious, owing to the possible failure or deficiency of the\r\nrains. Hence frequent famines would have been inevitable in those\r\nseasons of prolonged dryness and scorching heat, when \"the sky becomes\r\nas brass and the earth as iron.\"\r\n\r\nWhat an unspeakable blessing that against such, calamities a security\r\nshould have been found by the introduction of a grain calculated to\r\ngerminate under water; and that a perennial supply of the latter, not\r\nonly adequate for all ordinary purposes, but sufficient to guard against\r\nextraordinary emergencies of the seasons, should have been provided by\r\nthe ingenuity of the people, aided by the bounteous care of their\r\nsovereigns. It is no matter of surprise that the kings who devoted their\r\ntreasures and their personal energies to the formation of tanks and\r\ncanals have entitled their memory to traditional veneration, as\r\nbenefactors of their race and country. In striking contrast, it is the\r\npithy remark of the author of the _Rajavali_, mourning over the\r\nextinction of the Great Dynasty and the decline of the country, that\r\n\"_because the fertility of the land was decreased_ the kings who\r\nfollowed were no longer of such consequence as those who went\r\nbefore.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajavali_, p. 238]\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the construction of works for the advancement of\r\nagriculture, the patriarchal village system, copied from that which\r\nexisted from the earliest ages in India[1], was established in the newly\r\nsettled districts; and each hamlet, with its governing \"headman\" its\r\nartisans, its barber, its astrologer and washerman, was taught to\r\nconduct its own affairs by its village council; to repair its tanks and\r\nwatercourses, and to collect two harvests in each year by the combined\r\nlabour of the whole village community.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. x. p.67.]\r\n\r\nBetween the agricultural system of the mountainous districts and that of\r\nthe lowlands, there was at all times the same difference which still\r\ndistinguishes the tank cultivation of Neuera-kalawa and the Wanny from\r\nthe hanging rice lands of the Kandyan hills. In the latter, reservoirs\r\nare comparatively rare, as the natives rely on the certainty of the\r\nrains, which seldom fail at their due season in those lofty regions.\r\nStreams are conducted by means of channels ingeniously carried round the\r\nspurs of the hills and along the face of acclivities, so as to fertilise\r\nthe fields below, which in the technical phrase of the Kandyans are\r\n\"_assoedamised_\" for the purpose; that is, formed into terraces, each\r\nprotected by a shallow ledge over which the superfluous water trickles,\r\nfrom the highest level into that immediately below it; thus descending\r\nthrough all in succession till it escapes in the depths of the valley.\r\n\r\nFor the tillage of the lands with which the temples were so largely\r\nendowed in all quarters of the island, the sacred communities had\r\nassigned to them certain villages, a portion of whose labour was the\r\nproperty of the wihara[1]: slaves were also appropriated to them, and an\r\ninstance is mentioned in the fifth century[2], of the inhabitants of a\r\nlow-caste village having been bestowed on a monastery by the king\r\nAggrabodhi, \"in order that the priests might derive their service as\r\nslaves.\"[3] Sharing in a prerogative of royalty, some of the temples\r\nhad, moreover, a right to the compulsory labour of the community; and in\r\none of the inscriptions carved on the rock at Mihintala, the\r\n\"Raja-kariya writer\" is enumerated in the list of temple officers.[4]\r\nThe temple lands were occasionally let to tenants whose rent was paid\r\neither in \"land-fees,\" or in kind.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ibid_., ch. xxxvii. p. 247.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Rock inscriptions at Mihintala and at Dambool.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_ ch, xlii. TURNOUR, MS. translation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: TURNOUR'S _Epitome, Appendix,_ p. 88.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Ibid_ pp. 86, 87.]\r\n\r\n_Farm-stock._--The only farm-stock which appears to have been kept for\r\ntillage purposes, were buffaloes, which, then as now, were used in\r\ntreading the soft mud of the irrigated rice-fields, preparatory to\r\ncasting in the seed. Cows are alluded to in the _Mahawanso_, but never\r\nin connection with labour; and although butter is spoken of, it is only\r\nthat of the buffalo.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxvii p. 163.]\r\n\r\n_Gardens_.--Probably the earliest enclosures attempted in a state of\r\nincipient civilisation, were gardens for the exclusion of wild animals\r\nfrom fruit trees and vegetables, when these were first cultivated for\r\nthe use of man; and to the present day, the frequent occurrence of the\r\ntermination \"_watte_\" in the names of places on the map of Ceylon, is in\r\nitself an indication of the importance attached to them by the\r\nvillagers. The term \"garden,\" however, conveys to an European but an\r\nimperfect idea of the character and style of these places; which in\r\nCeylon are so similar to the native gardens in the south of India, as to\r\nsuggest a community of origin. Their leading features are lines of the\r\ngraceful areca palms, groves of oranges, limes, jak-trees, and bread\r\nfruit; and irregular clumps of palmyras and coconuts. Beneath these,\r\nthere is a minor growth, sometimes of cinnamon or coffee bushes; and\r\nalways a wilderness of plaintains, guavas and papaws; a few of the\r\ncommoner flowers; plots of brinjals (egg plants) and other esculents;\r\nand the stems of the standard trees are festooned with climbers, pepper\r\nvines, tomatas, and betel.\r\n\r\n_The Coco-nut Palm_.--It is curious and suggestive as regards the\r\ncoco-nut, which now enters so largely into the domestic economy of the\r\nSinghalese, that although it is sometimes spoken of in the _Mahawanso_\r\n(but by no means so often as the palmyra), no allusion is ever made to\r\nit as an article of diet, or an element in the preparation of food, nor\r\nis it mentioned, before the reign of Prakrama I., A.D. 1153[1], in the\r\nlist of those fruit-trees, the planting of which throughout the island\r\nis repeatedly recorded, as amongst the munificent acts of the Singhalese\r\nkings.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxii.]\r\n\r\nAs the other species of the same genus of palms are confined to the New\r\nWorld[1], a doubt has been raised whether the coco-nut be indigenous in\r\nIndia, or an importation. If the latter, the first plant must have been\r\nintroduced anterior to the historic age; and whatever the period at\r\nwhich the tree may have been first cultivated, a time is indicated when\r\nit was practically unknown in Ceylon by the fact, that a statue, without\r\ndate or inscription, is carved in high relief in a niche hollowed out of\r\na rock to the east of Galle, which tradition says is the monument to the\r\nKustia Raja, an Indian prince, whose claim to remembrance is, that he\r\n_first_ taught the Singhalese the use of the coco-nut.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: BROWN'S _Notes_ to TUCKEY'S _Expedition to the Congo_, p.\r\n456.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The earliest mention of the coco-nut in Ceylon occurs in\r\nthe _Mahawanso_, which refers to it as known at Rohuna to the south, B.\r\nc, 161 ( ch. xxv. p. 140). \"The milk of the small red coco-nut\" is\r\nstated to have been used been used by Dutugaimunu in preparing cement\r\nfor building the Ruanwellé dagoba (_Mah_. ch. xxx. p. 169). The\r\nsouth-west of the island, and especially the _margin of the sea_ is\r\nstill the locality in which the tree is found in greatest abundance in\r\nCeylon. Hither, if originally self-sown, it must have been floated and\r\nflung ashore by the waves; and as the north-east coast, though washed by\r\na powerful current, is almost altogether destitute of these palms, it is\r\nobvious that the coco-nut; if carried by sea from some other shore, must\r\nhave been brought during the south-west monsoon from the coast near Cape\r\nComorin, ÆLIAN notices as one of the leading peculiarities in the\r\nappearance of the sea coast of Ceylon, that the palm trees (by which, as\r\nthe south of the island was the place of resort, he most probably means\r\nthe coco-nut palms) grew in regular quincunxes, as if planted by skilful\r\nhands in a well ordered garden. [Greek: \"HÊ nêsos, hên kalousi\r\nTaprobanên, echei phoinikônas men thaumastês pephuteumenous eis\r\nstoichon, hôsper oun en tois habrois tôn paradeisôn oi toutôn meledônoi\r\nphuteuousi ta dendra ta skiadêphora.\"]--Lib. xvi. cp. 18. The\r\ncomparative silence of the _Mahawanso_ in relation to the coco-nut may\r\nprobably be referable to the fact that its author resided and wrote in\r\nthe interior of the island; over which, unlike the light seeds of other\r\nplants, its ponderous nuts could not have been distributed accidentally,\r\nwhere down to the present time it has been but partially introduced, and\r\nnowhere in any considerable number. Its presence throughout Ceylon is\r\nalways indicative of the vicinity of man, and at a distance from the\r\nshore it appears in those places only where it has been planted by his\r\ncare. The Singhalese believe that the coco-nut will not flourish \"unless\r\nyou walk under it and talk under it:\" but its proximity to human\r\nhabitations is possibly explained by the consideration that if exposed\r\nin the forest, it would be liable, when young, to be forced down by the\r\nelephants, who delight in its delicate leaves. See DAVY'S _Angler in the\r\nLake Districts, p._ 245.]\r\n\r\nThe mango, the jambo, and several other fruits are particularised, but\r\nthe historical books make no mention either of the pine-apple or the\r\nplantain, which appear to have been of comparatively recent\r\nintroduction. Pulse is alluded to at an early date under the generic\r\ndesignation of \"Masá.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxiii. p. 140.]\r\n\r\n_Rice and Curry._--Rice in various forms is always spoken of as the\r\nfood, alike of the sovereign, the priests, and the people; rice prepared\r\nplainly, conjee (the water in which rice is boiled), \"rice mixed with\r\nsugar and honey, and rice dressed with clarified butter.\"[1] Chillies\r\nare now and then mentioned as an additional condiment.[2] The _Rajavali_\r\nspeaks of curry in the second century before Christ[3] and the\r\n_Mahawanso_ in the fifth century after.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ibid_., ch. xxxii. p. 196.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid_., ch. xxv, p. 158; ch. xxvi. p. 160.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Rajavali_, pp. 196, 200, 202.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Mahawanso_, TURNOUR'S MS. translation, ch. xxxix.\r\n\r\nKNOX says that curry is a Portuguese word, _carré_ (_Relation_, &c.,\r\npart i. ch. iv. p. 12), but this is a misapprehension. Professor H.H.\r\nWILSON, in a private letter to me, says, \"In Hindustan we are accustomed\r\nto consider 'curry' to be derived from, _tarkari_, a general term for\r\nesculent vegetables, but it is probably the English version of the\r\nKanara and Malayalam _kadi_; pronounced with a hard _r_, 'kari' or\r\n'kuri,' which means sour milk with rice boiled, which was originally\r\nused for such compounds as curry at the present day. The Karnata\r\n_majkke-kari_ is a dish of rice, sour milk, spices, red pepper, &c,\r\n&c.\"]\r\n\r\nAlthough the taking of life is sternly forbidden in the ethical code of\r\nBuddha, and the most prominent of the obligations undertaken by the\r\npriesthood is directed to its preservation even in the instances of\r\ninsects and animalculæ, casuistry succeeded so far as to fix the crime\r\non the slayer, and to exonerate the individual who merely partook of the\r\nflesh.[1] Even the inmates of the wiharas and monasteries discovered\r\ndevices for the saving of conscience, and curried rice was not rejected\r\nin consequence of the animal ingredients incorporated with it. The mass\r\nof the population were nevertheless vegetarians, and so little value did\r\nthey place on animal food, that according to the accounts furnished to\r\nEDRISI by the Arabian seamen returning from Ceylon, \"a sheep sufficient\r\nto regale an assembly was to be bought there for half a drachm.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: HARDY'S _Eastern Monachism,_ ch. iv. p. 24; ch. ix. p. 92;\r\nch. xvi. p. 158. HARDY'S _Buddhism_, ch. vii. p. 327.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: EDRISI; _Géographie_, &c., tom. i. p. 73.]\r\n\r\n_Betel_--In connection with a diet so largely composed of vegetable\r\nfood, arose the custom, which to the present day is universal in\r\nCeylon,--of chewing the leaves of the betel vine, accompanied with lime\r\nand the sliced nut of the areca palm.[1] The betel (_piper betel_),\r\nwhich is now universally cultivated for this purpose, is presumed to\r\nhave been introduced from some tropical island, as it has nowhere been\r\nfound indigenous in continental India.[2] In Ceylon, its use is\r\nmentioned as early as the fifth century before Christ, when \"betel\r\nleaves\" formed the present sent by a princess to her lover.[3] In a\r\nconflict of Dutugaimunu with the Malabars, B.C. 161, the enemy seeing on\r\nhis lips the red stain of the betel, mistook it for blood, and spread\r\nthe false cry that the king had been slain.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For an account of the medicinal influence of betel-chewing,\r\nsee Part I. c. iii. § ii. p. 112.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: ROYLE'S _Essay on the Antiquity of Hindoo Medicine, p._\r\n85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: B. C. 504. _Mahawanso_, ch. ix. p. 57. Dutugaimunu, when\r\nbuilding the Ruanwellé dagoba, provided for the labourers amongst other\r\narticles \"the five condiments used in mastication.\" This probably refers\r\nto the chewing of betel and its accompaniments (_Mahawanso_, ch. xxx. p.\r\n175). A story is told of the wife of a Singhalese minister, about A. D.\r\n56, who to warn him of a conspiracy, sent him his \"betel, &c., for\r\nmastication, omitting the chunam,\" hoping that coming in search of it,\r\nhe might escape his \"impending fate.\" _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxv. p. 219.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Rajavali_, p. 221.]\r\n\r\nIntoxicating liquors are of sufficient antiquity to be denounced in the\r\nmoral system of Buddhism. The use of toddy and drinks obtained from the\r\nfermentation of \"bread and flour\" is condemned in the laity, and\r\nstrictly prohibited to the priesthood[1]; but the Arabian geographers\r\nmention that in the twelfth century, wine, in defiance of the\r\nprohibition, was imported from Persia, and drank by the Singhalese after\r\nbeing flavoured with cardamoms.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: HARDY'S _Buddhism_, e., ch. x. p. 474.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: EDRISI, _Geographle,_ &c., Trad. JAUBERT, tom. i. p. 73.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III\r\n\r\nEARLY COMMERCE, SHIPPING, AND PRODUCTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRADE.--At a very early period the mass of the people of Ceylon were\r\nessentially agricultural, and the proportion of the population addicted\r\nto other pursuits consisted of the small number of handicraftsmen\r\nrequired in a community amongst whom civilisation and refinement were so\r\nslightly developed, that the bulk of the inhabitants may be said to have\r\nhad few wants beyond the daily provision of food.\r\n\r\nUpon trade the natives appear to have looked at all times with\r\nindifference. Other nations, both of the east and west of Ceylon, made\r\nthe island their halting-place and emporium; the Chinese brought thither\r\nthe wares destined for the countries beyond the Euphrates, and the\r\nArabians and Persians met them with their products in exchange; but the\r\nSinghalese appear to have been uninterested spectators of this busy\r\ntraffic, in which they can hardly be said to have taken any share. The\r\ninhabitants of the opposite coast of India, aware of the natural wealth\r\nof Ceylon, participated largely in its development, and the Tamils, who\r\neagerly engaged in the pearl fishery, gave to the gulf of Manaar the\r\nname of Salabham, \"the sea of gain.\"[l]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Tamils gave the same name to Chilaw, which was the\r\nnearest town to the pearl fishery (and which Ibn Batuta calls\r\n_Salawat_); and eventually they called the whole island _Salabham_.]\r\n\r\n_Native Shipping._--The only mention made of native ships in the sacred\r\nwritings of the Singhalese, is in connection with missions, whether for\r\nthe promotion of Buddhism, or for the negotiation of marriages and\r\nalliances with the princes of India.[1] The building of dhoneys is\r\nadverted to as early as the first century, but they were only intended\r\nby a devout king to be stationed along the shores of the island, covered\r\nby day with white cloths, and by night illuminated with lamps, in order\r\nthat from them priests, as the royal almoners, might distribute gifts\r\nand donations of food.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, App. p. 73.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: By King Maha Dailiya, A.D. 8. _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxiv. p.\r\n211; _Rajavali_, p. 228; _Rajaratnacari_, p. 52.]\r\n\r\nThe genius of the people seems to have never inclined them to a\r\nsea-faring life, and the earliest notice which occurs of ships for the\r\ndefence of the coast, is in connection with the Malabars who were taken\r\ninto the royal service from their skill in naval affairs.[1] A national\r\nmarine was afterwards established for this purpose, A.D. 495, by the\r\nKing Mogallana.[2] In the _Suy-shoo_, a Chinese history of the Suy\r\ndynasty, it is stated that in A.D. 607, the king of Ceylon \"sent the\r\nBrahman Kew-mo-lo with thirty vessels, to meet the approaching ships\r\nwhich conveyed an embassy from China.\"[3] And in the twelfth century,\r\nwhen Prakrama I. was about to enter on his foreign expeditions, \"several\r\nhundreds of vessels were equipped for that service within five\r\nmonths.\"[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: B.C. 247. _Mahawanso_, ch. xxi. p. 127.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xl. TURNOUR'S MS. Transl.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Suy-shoo_, b. lxxxi. p. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, &c., App. p. 73.]\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the same apathy to navigation, if not antipathy to\r\nit, still prevails amongst the inhabitants of an island, the long\r\nsea-borde of which affords facilities for cultivating a maritime taste,\r\ndid any such exist. But whilst the natives of Hindustan fit out\r\nsea-going vessels, and take service as sailors for distant voyages, the\r\nSinghalese, though most expert as fishers and boatmen, never embark in\r\nforeign vessels, and no instance exists of a native ship, owned, built,\r\nor manned by Singhalese.\r\n\r\nThe boats which are in use at the present day, and which differ\r\nmaterially in build at different parts of the island, appear to have\r\nbeen all copied from models supplied by other countries. In the south\r\nthe curious canoes, which attract the eye of the stranger arriving at\r\nPoint de Galle by their balance-log and outrigger, were borrowed from\r\nthe islanders of the Eastern Archipelago; the more substantial canoe\r\ncalled a _ballam_, which is found in the estuaries and shallow lakes\r\naround the northern shore, is imitated from one of similar form on the\r\nMalabar coast; and the catamaran is common to Ceylon and Coromandel. The\r\nawkward dhoneys, built at Jaffna, and manned by Tamils, are imitated\r\nfrom those at Madras; while the Singhalese dhoney, south of Colombo, is\r\nbut an enlargement of the Galle canoe with its outrigger, so clumsily\r\nconstructed that the gunwale is frequently topped by a line of\r\nwicker-work smeared with clay, to protect the deck front the wash of the\r\nsea.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The gunwale of the boat of Ulysses was raised by hurdles of\r\nosiers to keep off the waves.\r\n\r\n[Greek: Phraxe de min rhipessi diamperes oisuinêsi Kumatos eilar emen\r\npollên d' epecheuato hulên.] _Od._ v. 256.]\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity in the mode of constructing the native shipping of\r\nCeylon existed in the remotest times, and is retained to the present\r\nday. The practice is closely connected with one of the most imaginative\r\nincidents in the medieval romances of the East Their boats and canoes,\r\nlike those of the Arabs and other early navigators who crept along the\r\nshores of India, are put together without the use of iron nails[1], the\r\nplanks being secured by wooden bolts, and stitched together with cords\r\nspun from the fibre of the coconut.[2]\r\n\r\nPALLADIUS, a Greek of the lower empire, to whom is ascribed an account\r\nof the nations of India, written in the fifth century[3], adverts to\r\nthis peculiarity of construction, and connects it with the phenomenon\r\nwhich forms so striking an incident in one of the tales in the _Arabian\r\nNights' Entertainments_. In the story of the \"Three Royal Mendicants,\"\r\nthe \"Third Calender,\" as he is called in the old translation, relates to\r\nthe ladies of Bagdad, in whose house he is entertained, how he and his\r\ncompanions lost their course, when sailing in the Indian Ocean, and\r\nfound themselves in the vicinity of \"the mountain of loadstone towards\r\nwhich the current carried them with violence, and when the ships\r\napproached it they fell asunder, and the nails and everything that was\r\nof iron flew from them towards the loadstone.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: DELAURIER, Études sur la \"_Relation des voyages faits par\r\nles Arabes et les Persans dans l'Inde.\" Journ. Asiat._ tom. xlix. p.\r\n137. See also MALTE BRUN, _Hist. de Géogr._ tom. i. p. 409, with the\r\nreferences to the Periplus Mar. Erythr., Strabo, Procopius, &c. GIBBON,\r\n_Decl. and Fall_, vol. v. ch. xl.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Boats thus sewn together existed at an early period on the\r\ncoast of Arabia as well as of Ceylon. Odoric of Friuli saw them at Ormus\r\nin the fourteenth century (_Hakluyt_, vol. ii. p. 35); and the\r\nconstruction of ships without iron was not peculiar to the Indian seas,\r\nas Homer mentions that the boat built by Ulysses was put together with\r\nwoolen pegs, [Greek: _gomphoisin_], instead of bolts. _Odys_. v. 249.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The tract alluded to is usually known as tne treatise _de\r\nMoribus Brachmanorum_, and ascribed to St. Ambrose. For an account of it\r\nsee Vol. I. Pt. v. ch. i. p. 538.]\r\n\r\nThe learned commentator, LANE, says that several Arab writers describe\r\nthis mountain of loadstone, and amongst others he instances El Caswini,\r\nwho lived in the latter half of the thirteenth century.[1] EDRISI, the\r\nArab geographer, likewise alludes to it; but the invention belongs to an\r\nearlier age, and Palladius, in describing Ceylon, says that the magnetic\r\nrock is in the adjacent islands called Maniolæ (Maldives?), and that\r\nships coming within the sphere of its influence are irresistibly drawn\r\ntowards it, and lose all power of progress except in its direction.\r\nHence it is essential, he adds, that vessels sailing for Ceylon _should\r\nbe fastened with wooden instead of iron bolts_.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: LANE'S _Arabian Nights_, vol. i. ch. iii, p. 72, p. 242.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: [Greek: \"Esti de idikôs ta diaperônta ploia eis ekeinên tên\r\nmegalên nêson aneu sidêrou epiouriois xylinois\r\nkataskeuasmena\"]--PALLADIUS, in _Pseudo-Callisthenes_, lib. iii. c. vii.\r\nBut the fable of the loadstone mountain is older than either the Arabian\r\nsailors or the Greeks of the lower empire. Aristotle speaks of a\r\nmagnetic mountain on the coast of India, and Pliny repeats the story,\r\nadding that \"si sint clavi in calciamentis, vestigia avelli in altero\r\nnon posse in altero sisti.\"--Lib. ii. c. 98, lib. xxxvi. c. 25. Ptolemy\r\nrecounts a similar fable in his geography. Klaproth, in his _Lettre sur\r\nla Boussole_, says that this romantic belief was first communicated to\r\nthe West from China. \"Les anciens auteurs Chinois parlent aussi de\r\nmontagnes magnétiques de la mer méridionale sur les côtes de Tonquin et\r\nde la Cochin Chine; et disent que si les vaisseaux étrangers qui sont\r\ngarnis de plaques de fer s'en approchent ils y sont arrètés et aucun\r\nd'eux ne peut passer par ces endroits.\"--KLAPROTH, _Lett._ v. p. 117,\r\nquoted by SANTAREM, _Essai sur l'Histo. de Cosmogr._, vol. i. p. 182.]\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of the native craft on the west coast of Ceylon is\r\ntheir construction with a prow at each extremity, a characteristic which\r\nbelongs also to the Massoula boats of Madras, as well as to others on\r\nthe south of India. It is a curious illustration of the abiding nature\r\nof local usages when originating in necessities and utility, that\r\nSTRABO, in describing the boats in which the traffic was carried on\r\nbetween Taprobane and the continent, says they were \"built with prows at\r\neach end, but without holds or keels.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: [Greek: \"Kateskeuasmenas de amphoterôthen enkoiliôn mêtrôn\r\nchôris.\"]--Lib xv. c. i. s. 14. Pliny, who makes the same statement,\r\nsays the Singhalese adopted this model to avoid the necessity of tacking\r\nin the narrow and shallow channels, between Ceylon and the mainland of\r\nIndia (lib. vi. c. 24).]\r\n\r\nIn connection with foreign trade the _Mahawanso_ contains repeated\r\nallusions to ships wrecked upon the coast of Ceylon[1], and amongst the\r\nremarkable events which signalised the season, already rendered\r\nmemorable by the birth of Dutugaimunu, B.C. 204, was the \"arrival on the\r\nsame day of seven ships laden with golden utensils and other goods;\"[2]\r\nand as these were brought by order of the king to Mahagam, then the\r\ncapital of Rohuna, the incident is probably referable to the foreign\r\ntrade which was then carried on in the south of the island[3] by the\r\nChinese and Arabians, and in which, as I have stated, the native\r\nSinghalese took no part.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: B.C. 543. _Mahawanso_, ch. vii. p. 49: B.C. 306. Ibid. ch.\r\nxi. p. 68, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxii. p. 135.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The first direct intimation of trading carried on by native\r\nSinghalese, along the coast of Ceylon, occurs in the _Rajavali_, but not\r\ntill the year A.D. 1410,--the king, who had made Cotta his capital,\r\nbeing represented as \"loading a vessel with goods and sending it to\r\nJaffna, to carry on commerce with his son.\"--_Rajavali_, p. 289.]\r\n\r\nStill, notwithstanding their repugnance to intercourse with strangers,\r\nthe Singhalese were not destitute of traffic amongst themselves, and\r\ntheir historical annals contain allusions to the mode in which it was\r\nconducted. Their cities exhibited rows of shops and bazaars[1], and the\r\ncountry was traversed by caravans much in the same manner as the drivers\r\nof _tavalams_ carry goods at the present day between the coast and the\r\ninterior.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: B.C. 204, a visitor to Anarajapoora is described as\r\n\"purchasing aromatic drugs from the bazaars, and departing by the\r\nNorthern Gate\" (_Mahawanso_, ch. xxiii. p. 139); and A.D. 8, the King\r\nMaha Dathika \"ranged shops on each side of the streets of the\r\ncapital.\"--_Mahawanso_, ch. xxxiv. p. 213.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: B.C. 170. _Mahawanso_ ch. xxii. p. 138.]\r\n\r\nWhatever merchandise was obtained in barter from foreign ships, was by\r\nthis means conveyed to the cities and the capital[1], and the reference\r\nto carts which were accustomed to go from Anarajapoora to the division\r\nof Malaya, lying round Adam's Peak, \"to procure saffron and ginger,\"\r\nimplies that at that period (B.C. 165) roads and other facilities for\r\nwheel carriages must have existed, enabling them to traverse forests and\r\ncross the rivers.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the reign of Elala, B.C. 204, the son of \"an eminent\r\ncaravan chief\" was despatched to a Brahman, who resided near the Chetiyo\r\nmountain (Mihintala), in whose possession there were rich articles,\r\nfrankincense, sandal-wood, &c., imported from beyond the\r\nocean.--_Mahawanso_ ch. xxiii. p. 138.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_ ch. xxviii. p, 167.]\r\n\r\n_Early Exports of Ceylon._--The native historians give an account of the\r\nexports of Ceylon, which corresponds in all particulars with the records\r\nleft by the early travellers and merchants, Greek, Roman, Arabian,\r\nIndian, and Chinese. They consisted entirely of natural productions,\r\naromatic drugs, gems, pearls, and shells; and it is a strong evidence of\r\nthe more advanced state of civilisation in India at the same period\r\nthat, whilst the presents sent from the kings of Ceylon to the native\r\nprinces of Hindustan and the Dekkan were always of this precious but\r\nprimitive character, the articles received in return were less\r\nremarkable for the intrinsic value of the material, than for the\r\nworkmanship bestowed upon them. Devenipiatissa sent by his ambassadors\r\nto Asoca, B.C. 306, the eight varieties of pearls, viz., _haya_ (the\r\nhorse), _gaja_ (the elephant), _ratha_ (the chariot wheel), _maalaka_\r\n(the nelli fruit), _valaya_ (the bracelet), _anguliwelahka_ (the ring),\r\n_kakudaphala_ (the kabook fruit), and _pakatika_, the ordinary\r\ndescription. He sent sapphires, lapis lazuli[1], and rubies, a right\r\nhand chank[2], and three bamboos for chariot poles, remarkable because\r\ntheir natural marking resembled the carvings of flowers and animals.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Lapis lazuli is not found in Ceylon, and must have been\r\nbrought by the caravans from Budakshan. It is more than once mentioned\r\nin the _Mahawanso_, ch. xi. p. 69; ch. xxx. p. 185.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A variety of the _Turbinella rapa_ with the whorls\r\nreversed, to which the natives attach a superstitions value; professing\r\nthat a shell so formed is worth its weight in gold.]\r\n\r\nThe gifts sent by the king of Magadha in return, indicate the advanced\r\nstate of the arts in Bengal, even at that early period: they were \"a\r\nchowrie (the royal fly flapper), a diadem, a sword of state, a royal\r\nparasol, golden slippers, a crown, an anointing vase, asbestos towels,\r\nto be cleansed by being passed through the fire, a costly howdah, and\r\nsundry vessels of gold.\" Along with these was sacred water from the\r\nAnotatto lake and from the Ganges, aromatic and medicinal drugs, hill\r\npaddi and sandal-wood; and amongst the other items \"a virgin of royal\r\nbirth and of great personal beauty.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_ ch, xi. pp. 69, 70.]\r\n\r\n_Early Imports_.--Down to a very late period, gems, pearls, and chank\r\nshells continued to be the only products taken away from Ceylon, and\r\ncinnamon is nowhere mentioned in the Sacred Books as amongst the exports\r\nof the island.[1] In return for these exports, slaves, chariots, and\r\nhorses were frequently transmitted from India. The riding horses and\r\nchargers, so often spoken of[2], must necessarily have been introduced\r\nfrom thence, and were probably of Arab blood; but I have not succeeded\r\nin discovering to what particular race the \"Sindhawa\" horses belonged,\r\nof which four purely white were harnessed to the state carriage of\r\nDutugaimunu.[3] Gold cloth[4], frankincense, and sandal-wood were\r\nbrought from India[5], as was also a species of \"clay\" and of\r\n\"cloud-coloured stone,\" which appear to have been used in the\r\nconstruction of dagobas.[6] Silk[7] and vermilion[8] indicate the\r\nactivity of trade with China; and woollen cloth[9] and carpets[10] with\r\nPersia and Kashmir.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For an account of the earliest trade in cinnamon, see\r\n_post_ Part v. ch. ii. on the Knowledge of Ceylon possessed by the\r\nArabians.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxii. p. 134, &c. &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Ibid_., ch. xxiii. p. 142; ch. xxxi. p. 186.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: A.D.459. _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxviii. p. 258.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Ibid_, ch. xxiii. p. 138.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Ibid_, ch. xxix. p. 169; ch. xxx. p. 179.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Ibid_., ch. xxiii. p. 139; _Rajaratnacari_, p. 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _Ibid_, ch. xxix. p. 169; _Rajaratnacari_ p. 51.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxx. p. 177; _Rajavali_, p. 269.

In the fabulous period of the narrative, a king of Kashmir is\r\nsaid to have sent to Ceylon for a delicately fine cloth, embroidered\r\nwith golden footsteps.[2] In the eighth century of the Christian era,\r\nSinghalese engineers were sent for to construct works in Kashmir[3]; and\r\nKashmir, according to Troyer, took part in the trade between Ceylon and\r\nthe West.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The _Rajatarangini_ resembles the _Mahawanso_, in being a\r\nmetrical chronicle of Kashmir written at various times by a series of\r\nauthors, the earliest of whom lived in the 12th century. It has been\r\ntranslated into French by M. Troyer, Paris, 1840.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajatarangini_, b. i. sl. 294.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Rajatarangini_, b. iv. sl. 502, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"La communication entre Kachmir et Ceylan n'a pas eu lieu\r\nseulement par les entreprises guerrières que je viens de rappeler, mais\r\naussi par un commerce paisible; c'est du cette ile que venaient des\r\nartistes qu'on appelait Rakchasas à cause du merveilleux de leur art; et\r\nqui exécutaient des ouvrages pour l'utilité et pour l'ornement d'un pays\r\nmontagneux et sujet aux inondations. Ceci confirme ce que nous\r\napprennent les géographes Grecs, que Ceylan, avant et après le\r\ncommencement de notre ère, était un grand point de réunion pour le\r\ncommerce de l'Orient et de l'Occident.\"--_Rajatarangini_, vol. ii. p.\r\n434.]\r\n\r\nOf the trade between Ceylon and Kashmir and its progress, the account\r\ngiven by Edrisi, the most renowned of the writers on eastern geography,\r\nwho wrote in the twelfth century[1], is interesting, inasmuch as it may\r\nbe regarded as a picture of this remarkable commerce, after it had\r\nattained its highest development.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Abou-abd-allah Mahommed was a Moor of the family who\r\nreigned over Malaga after the fall of the Kalifat of Cordova, in the\r\nearly part of the 11th century, and his patronymic of Edrisi or Al\r\nEdrissy implies that he was descended from the princes of that race who\r\nhad previously held supreme power in what is at the present day the\r\nEmpire of Morocco. He took up his residence in Sicily under the\r\npatronage of the Norman king, Roger II., A.D. 1154, and the work on\r\ngeography which he there composed was not only based on the previous\r\nlabours of Massoudi, Ibn Haukul, Albyrouni, and others, but it embodied\r\nthe reports of persons commissioned specially by the king to undertake\r\nvoyages for the purpose of bringing back correct accounts of foreign\r\ncountries. See REINAUD'S _Introduction to the Geography of Abulfeda_, p.\r\ncxiii.]\r\n\r\nEdrisi did not write from personal knowledge, as he had never visited\r\neither Ceylon or India; but compiling as he did, by command of Roger H.,\r\nof Sicily, a compendium, of geographical knowledge as it existed in his\r\ntime, the information which he has systematised may be regarded as a\r\ncondensation of such facts as the eastern seamen engaged in the Indian\r\ntrade had brought back with them from Ceylon.\r\n\r\n\"In the mountains around Adam's Peak,\" says Edrisi, \"they collect\r\nprecious stones of every description, and in the valleys they find those\r\ndiamonds by means of which they engrave the setting of stones on rings.\"\r\n\r\n\"The same mountains produce aromatic drugs perfumes, and aloes-wood, and\r\nthere too they find the animal, the civet, which yields musk. The\r\nislanders cultivate rice, coco-nuts, and sugar-cane; in the rivers is\r\nfound rock crystal, remarkable both for brilliancy and size, and the sea\r\non every side has a fishery of magnificent and priceless pearls.\r\nThroughout India there is no prince whose wealth can compare with the\r\nKing of Serendib, his immense riches, his pearls and his jewels, being\r\nthe produce of his own dominions and seas; and thither ships of China,\r\nand of every neighbouring country resort, bringing the wines of Irak and\r\nFars, which the king buys for sale to his subjects; for he drinks wine\r\nand prohibits debauchery; whilst other princes of India encourage\r\ndebauchery and prohibit the use of wine. The exports from Serendib\r\nconsist of silk, precious stones, crystals, diamonds, and perfumes.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Edrisi, _Géographie_, Trad. JAUBERT, tom. i. p. 73.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe silk alluded to in the last chapter must have been brought from\r\nChina for re-exportation to the West. Silk is frequently mentioned in\r\nthe _Mahawanso_[1] but never with any suggestion of its being a native\r\nproduct of Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Silk is mentioned 20 B.C. _Rajaratnacari_, p. 49.\r\n_Mahawanso_, ch. xxiii. p. 139.]\r\n\r\n_Coir and Cordage._--EDRISI speaks of cordage made from the fibre of the\r\ncoco-nut, to prepare which, the natives of Oman and Yemen resorted to\r\nCeylon[1]; so that the Singhalese would appear to have been instructed\r\nby the Arabs in the treatment of coir, and its formation into ropes; an\r\noccupation which, at the present day, affords extensive employment to\r\nthe inhabitants of the south and south-western coasts. Ibn Batuta\r\ndescribes the use of coir, for sewing together the planking of boats, as\r\nit was practised at Zafar in the fourteenth century[2]; and the word\r\nitself bespeaks its Arabian origin, as ALBYROUNI, who divides the\r\nMaldives and Laccadives into two classes, calls the one group the\r\n_Dyvah-kouzah_, or islands that produce _cowries_; and the other the\r\n_Dyvah-kanbar_, or islands that produce _coir_.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: EDRISI, t. i. p. 74.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Voyages_, &c., vol. ii. p. 207. Paris, 1854.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: ALBYROUNI, in REYNAUD, _Fragm. Arabes, &c.,_ pp, 93, 124\r\nThe Portuguese adopted the word from the Hindus, and CASTANEDA, in\r\n_Hist. of the Discovery of India,_ describes the Moors of Sofalah sewing\r\ntheir boats with \"_cayro\"_ ch. v, 14, xxx. 75.]\r\n\r\n_Dress_.--The dress of the people was of the simplest kind, and similar\r\nto that which is worn at the present day. The bulk of the population\r\nwore scanty cloths, without shape or seam, folded closely round the body\r\nand the portion of the limbs which it is customary to cover; and the\r\nChinese, who visited the island in the seventh century, described the\r\npeople as clothed in the loose robe, still known as a \"comboy,\" a word\r\nprobably derived from the Chinese _koo-pei_, which signifies cotton.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Part v. ch. iii. on the Knowledge of Ceylon possessed\r\nby the Chinese.]\r\n\r\nThe wealthier classes indulged in flowing robes, and Bujas Dasa the\r\nking, who in the fourth century devoted himself to the study of medicine\r\nand the cure of the sick, was accustomed, when seeking objects for his\r\ncompassion, to appear as a common person, simply \"disguising himself by\r\ngathering his cloth up between his legs.\"[1] Robes with flowers[2], and\r\na turban of silk, constituted the dress of state bestowed on men whom\r\nthe king delighted to honour.[3] Cloth of gold is spoken of in the fifth\r\ncentury, but the allusion is probably made to the kinbaub of India.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso,_ ch. xxxvii. p.245.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: By the ordinances of Buddhism it was forbidden to the\r\npriesthood \"to adorn the body with flowers,\" thus showing it to have\r\nbeen a practice of the laity.

Kuweni, when the adventurer\r\napproached her, was \"seated at the foot of a tree, spinning thread;\"[1]\r\ncotton was the ordinary material, but \"linen cloth\" is mentioned in the\r\nsecond century before Christ.[2] White cloths are spoken of as having\r\nbeen employed, in the earliest times, in every ceremony for covering\r\nchairs on which persons of rank were expected to be seated; whole \"webs\r\nof cloth\" were used to wrap the _carandua_ in which the sacred relics\r\nwere enclosed[3], and one of the kings, on the occasion of consecrating\r\na dagoba at Mihintala, covered with \"white cloth\" the road taken by the\r\nprocession between the mountain and capital, a distance of more than\r\nseven miles.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. vii. p.48; _Rajavali_, p.173.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch, xxv. p.152.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Rajaratnacari_, p.72.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: A.D. 8. _Rajavali,_ p. 227; _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxiv. p.\r\n213.]\r\n\r\nIn later times a curious practice prevailed, which exists to the present\r\nday;--on occasions when it is intended to make offerings of yellow robes\r\nto the priesthood, the cotton was plucked from the tree at daybreak, and\r\n\"cleaned, spun, woven, dyed, and made into garments\" before the setting\r\nof the sun. This custom, called _Catina Dhawna,_ is first referred to in\r\nthe _Rajaratnacari_ in the reign of Prakrarna I.[1], A.D. 1153.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See _ante_, Vol. II p. 35. _Rajaratnacari_, pp. 104, 109,\r\n112, 135; _Rajavali_, p. 261; HARDY'S _Eastern Monachism_, ch. xii. pp.\r\n114, 121.]\r\n\r\nThe expression \"made into garments\" alludes to the custom enjoined on\r\nthe priests of having the value of the material destroyed, before\r\nconsenting to accept it as a gift, thus carrying out their vow of\r\npoverty. The robe of Gotama Buddha was cut into thirty pieces, these\r\nwere again united, so that they \"resembled the patches of ground in a\r\nrice field;\" and hence he enjoined on his followers the observance of\r\nthe same practice.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: HARDY'S _Eastern Monachism,_ ch. xii. p. 117. See _ante_,\r\nVol. I. Pt. III. ch. iv. p. 351.]\r\n\r\nThe arts of bleaching and dyeing were understood as well as that of\r\nweaving, and the _Mahawanso_, in describing the building of the\r\nRuanwellé dagoba, at Anarajapoora, B.C. 161, tells of a canopy formed of\r\n\"eight thousand pieces of cloth of every hue.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxx. p. 179, See also ch. xxxviii. p.\r\n258.]\r\n\r\n_Earliest Artisans._--VALENTYN, writing on the traditional information\r\nacquired from the Singhalese themselves, records the belief of the\r\nlatter, that in the suite of the Pandyan princess, who arrived to marry\r\nWijayo, were artificers from Madura, who were the first to introduce the\r\nknowledge and practice of handicrafts amongst the native population.\r\nAccording to the story, these were goldsmiths, blacksmiths,\r\nbrass-founders, carpenters, and stone-cutters.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: VALENTYN, _Oud en Niew Oost-Indien_, chap. iv. p. 267.]\r\n\r\nThe legend is given with more particularity in an historical notice of\r\nthe Chalia caste, written by Adrian Rajapaxa, one of their chiefs, who\r\ndescribes these immigrants as Peskare Brahmans, who were at first\r\nemployed in weaving gold tissues for the queen, but who afterwards\r\nabandoned that art for agriculture. A fresh company were said to have\r\nbeen invited in the reign of Devenipiatissa, and were the progenitors of\r\n\"Saleas, at present called Chalias,\" who inhabit the country between\r\nGalle and Colombo, and who, along with their ostensible occupation as\r\npeelers of cinnamon, still employ themselves in the labours of the\r\nloom.[1] All handicrafts are conventionally regarded by the Singhalese\r\nas the occupations of an inferior class; and a man of high caste would\r\nsubmit to any privation rather than stoop to an occupation dependent on\r\nmanual skill.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A History of the Chalias, by ADRIAN RAJAPAXA. _Asiatic\r\nRes_. vol. vii. p. 440. _Ib_., vol. x. p. 82.]\r\n\r\n_Pottery_.--One of the most ancient arts, the making of earthenware\r\nvessels, exists at the present day in all its pristine simplicity, and\r\nthe \"potter's wheel,\" which is kept in motion by an attendant, whilst\r\nthe hands of the master are engaged in shaping the clay as it revolves,\r\nis the primitive device which served a similar purpose amongst the\r\nEgyptians and Hebrews.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pottery is mentioned in the _Mahawanso_, B.C. 161, ch.\r\nxxix. p. 173: the allusion is to \"new earthen vases,\" and shows that the\r\npeople at that time, like the Hindus of today, avoided where possible\r\nthe repeated use of the same vessel.]\r\n\r\nA \"potter\" is enumerated in the list of servants and tradesmen attached\r\nto the temple on the Rock of Mihintala, A.D. 262, along with a\r\nsandal-maker, blacksmiths, carpenters, stone-cutters, goldsmiths, and\r\n\"makers of strainers\" through which the water for the priests was\r\nfiltered, to avoid taking away the life of animalculæ. The other\r\nartisans on the establishment were chiefly those in charge of the\r\nbuildings, lime-burners, plasterers, white-washers, painters, and a\r\nchief builder.\r\n\r\n_Glass_.--Glass, the knowledge of which existed in Egypt and in\r\nIndia[1], was introduced into Ceylon at an early period; and in the\r\n_Dipawanso_, a work older than the _Mahawanso_ by a century and a half,\r\nit is stated that Saidaitissa, the brother of Dutugaimunu, when\r\ncompleting the Ruanwellé dagoba, which his predecessor had commenced,\r\nsurmounted it with a \"glass pinnacle.\" This was towards the end of the\r\nsecond century before Christ. Glass is frequently mentioned at later\r\nperiods; and a \"glass mirror\" is spoken of[2] in the third century\r\nbefore Christ, but how made, whether by an amalgam of quicksilver or by\r\ncolouring the under surface, is not recorded.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. ROYLE'S _Lectures on the Arts and Manufactures of\r\nIndia_, 1852, p. 221. PLINY says the glass of India being made of\r\npounded crystal, none other can compare with it. (Lib. xxxvi, c. 66.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xv. p. 99, ch. xxx. p. 182.]\r\n\r\n_Leather_.--The tanning of leather from the hide of the buffalo was\r\nunderstood so far back as the second century before Christ, and\r\n\"coverings both for the back and the feet of elephants\" were then formed\r\nof it.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ibid_., ch. xxv. p. 152, ch. xxix. p. 169.]\r\n\r\n_Wood-carving_.--Carving in sandal-wood and inlaying with ivory, of\r\nwhich latter material \"state fans and thrones\" were constructed for the\r\nBrazen Palace[1], are amongst the mechanical arts often alluded to; and\r\nduring the period of prosperity which signalised the era of the \"Great\r\nDynasty,\" there can be little doubt that skilled artificers were brought\r\nfrom India to adorn the cities and palaces of Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ibid_., ch. xxvii. p. 163, 164.]\r\n\r\n_Chemical Arts_.--A rude knowledge of chemical manipulation was required\r\nfor the extraction of camphor[1] and the preparation of numerous\r\narticles specified amongst the productions of the island, aromatic\r\noils[2], perfumes[3], and vegetable dyes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajaratnacari_, p. 133. Dr. ROYLE doubts whether camphor\r\nwas known to the Hindus at this early period, but \"camphor oil\" is\r\nrepeatedly mentioned in the Singhalese chronicles amongst the articles\r\nprovided for the temples.--ROYLE'S _Essay on Hindoo Medicine_, p. 140;\r\n_Rajaculi_, p. 190.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxv. p. 157.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: B.C. 161. _Mahawanso_, ch. xxx. p. 180.]\r\n\r\n_Sugar_.--Sugar was obtained not only from the Palmyra and Kittool\r\npalms[1], but also from the cane; which, besides being a native of\r\nIndia, was also indigenous in Ceylon.[2] A \"sugar mill\" for expressing\r\nits juice existed in the first century before Christ in the district of\r\nthe \"Seven Corles,\"[3] where fifteen hundred years afterwards a Dutch\r\ngovernor of the island made an attempt to restore the cultivation of\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Palm sugar,\" as distinguished from \"cane sugar,\" is spoken\r\nof in the _Mahawanso_ in the second century B.C. ch. xxvii. p. 163.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"Cane sugar\" is referred to in the _Mahawanso_ B.C. 161,\r\nch. xxvii. p. 162, ch. xxxi. p. 192.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: A.D. 77. _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxiv. p. 208.]\r\n\r\n_Mineral Paints_.--Mineral preparations were made with success. Red\r\nlead, orpiment, and vermilions are mentioned as pigments; but as it is\r\ndoubtful whether Ceylon produces quicksilver, the latter was probably\r\nimported from. China[1] or India, where the method of preparing it has\r\nlong been known.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See _ante_, Vol. I. Part I. ch. i. p. 29. n. Both\r\nquicksilver and vermilion are mentioned in the _Rajaratnacari_, p. 51,\r\nas being in use in the year 20 B.C. Vermilion is also spoken of B.C. 307\r\nin the _Mahawanso_, ch. xxvii. p. 162, c. The two passages in which\r\n_vermilion_ is spoken of in the Old Testament, Jerem. xxii. 14, and\r\nEzek. xxiii. 14, both refer to the painting of walls and woodwork, a\r\npurpose to which it would be scarcely suitable, were not the article\r\nalluded to the opaque bisulphuret of mercury; and the same remark\r\napplies to the vermilion used by the Singhalese. The bright red obtained\r\nfrom the insect coccus (the _vermiculus_, whence the original term\r\n\"vermilion\" is said to be derived) would be too transparent to be so\r\napplied.]\r\n\r\nThere is likewise sufficient evidence in these and a number of other\r\npreparations, as well in the notices of perfumes, camphor, and essential\r\noils, to show that the Singhalese, like the Hindus, had a very early\r\nacquaintance with chemical processes and with the practice of\r\ndistillation, which they retain to the present day.[1] The knowledge of\r\nthe latter they probably acquired from the Arabs or Chinese.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"I was frequently visited by one old man, a priest, who had\r\ntravelled through Bengal, Burmah, Siam, and many other countries, and\r\nwho prided himself on being able _to make calomel_ much better than the\r\nEuropean doctors, as his preparation did not cause the falling out of\r\nthe teeth, soreness of the mouth, or salivation. He learnt the secret\r\nfrom an ancient sage whom he met with in a forest on the continent of\r\nIndia; and often when listening to him I was reminded of the mysteries\r\nand crudities of the alchemists.\"--HARDY'S _Eastern Monachism_, Lond.\r\n1850, ch. xxiii. p. 312.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\nWORKING IN METALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETALS. _Iron_.--Working in metals was early understood in Ceylon.\r\nAbundance of iron ore can be extracted from the mountains round Adam's\r\nPeak; the black oxide is found on the eastern shore in the state of\r\niron-sand; and both are smelted with comparative ease by the natives.\r\nIron tools were in use for the dressing of stones; and in the third\r\ncentury before Christ, the enclosed city of Wijittapoora was secured by\r\nan \"iron gate.\" [1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxv. p. 152.]\r\n\r\n_Steel_.--The manufacture of arms involved the use of steel, the method\r\nof tempering which was derived from the Hindus, by whom the _wootz_ was\r\nprepared, of which, the genuine blades of Damascus are shown to have\r\nbeen made, the beauty of their figuring being dependent on its peculiar\r\ncrystallisation. Ezekiel enumerates amongst the Indian imports of Tyre\r\n\"_bright iron_, calamus and cassia.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: ROYLE _on the Antiquity of Hindoo Medicine_, p. 98.\r\nEZEKIEL, ch. xxvii. 19.]\r\n\r\n_Copper_.--Copper was equally in demand, but, like silver and gold, it\r\nis nowhere alluded to as a production of the island. In ancient, as in\r\nmodern, times, therefore, the numerous articles formed from this metal\r\nwere probably imported from India. The renowned Brazen. Palace of\r\nAnarajapoora was so named from the quantity of copper used in its\r\nconstruction. Bujas Raja, A.D. 359, covered a building at Attanagalla\r\nwith \"tiles made of copper, and gilt with gold,\"[1] and \"two boats built\r\nof brass,\" were placed near the Bo-Tree at the capital \"to hold food for\r\nthe priests.\"[2] Before the Christian era, armour for elephants[3], and\r\nvessels of large dimensions, cauldrons[4], and baths[5], were formed of\r\ncopper. The same material was used for the lamps, goblets[6], kettles,\r\nand cooking utensils of the monasteries and wiharas.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajaratnacari_, p. 73.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid_., p. 60.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Rajavali_, p. 214.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: B.C. 204. _Rajavali_, p. 190.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: A.D. 1267, _Rajartnacari_, p. 104.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Rajaratnacari_, pp. 104, 134.]\r\n\r\n_Bells_.--Bells were hung in the palaces[1], and bell-metal is amongst\r\nthe gifts to the temples recorded on the rock at Pollanarrua, A.D.\r\n1187.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxi. pp. 128, 129.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: TURNOUR'S _Epitome, &c.,_ Appx. p. 91.]\r\n\r\n_Bronze_.--Bronze was cast into figures of Buddha[1], and the\r\n_Mahawanso_, describing the reign of Dhatu-Sena, A.D. 459, makes mention\r\nof \"sixteen bronze statues of virgins having the power of\r\nlocomotion.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A.D. 275. _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxvii. p. 236; _Rajavali_, p.\r\nl35.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxviii. p. 257.]\r\n\r\n_Lead_.--Lead was used during the wars of Dutugaimunu and Elala, and\r\npoured molten over the attacking elephants during the siege of\r\nWijittapoora.[1] As lead is not a native product of Ceylon, it must have\r\nbeen brought thither from Ava or Malwa.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxv. p. 152.]\r\n\r\n_Gold and Silver._--Ceylon, like the continent of India, produces no\r\nsilver and gold, save in the scantiest quantities.[1] The historical\r\nbooks, in recording the splendour of the temples and their riches, and\r\nthe wealth lavished by the kings upon the priesthood, describe in\r\nperpetually recurring terms, the multitude of ornaments and vessels made\r\nof silver and gold. In early times the most precious of these were\r\nreceived as gifts from the princes of India, and in the second century\r\nbefore Christ the _Mahawanso_ records the arrival of ships in the south\r\nof the island, \"laden with golden utensils.\" The import of these might\r\npossibly have been a relic of the early trade with the Phoenicians, whom\r\nHomer, in a passage quoted by Strabo (l. xvi. c. 2. s. 24.), describes\r\nas making these cups, and carrying across the sea for sale in the great\r\nemporiums visited by these ships.[2] A variety of articles of silver are\r\nspoken of at very early periods. Dutugaimunu, when building the great\r\ndagoba, caused the circle of its base to be described by \"a pair of\r\ncompasses made of silver, and pointed with gold;\"[3] parasols, vases,\r\ncaranduas and numerous other regal or religious paraphernalia, were made\r\nfrom this precious material. Gold was applied in every possible form and\r\ncombination to the decoration and furnishing of the edifices of\r\nBuddhism;--\"trees of gold with roots of coral,\"[4] flowers formed of\r\ngems with stems of silver[5], fringes of bullion mixed with pearls;\r\numbrellas, shields, chains, and jewelled statuettes[6], are described\r\nwith enthusiasm by the annalists of the national worship.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Amongst the miracles which signalised the construction of\r\nthe Ruanwellé dagoba at Anarajapoora was the sudden appearance in a\r\nlocality to the north-east of the capital of \"sprouts\" of gold above and\r\nbelow the ground, and of silver in the vicinity of Adam's\r\nPeak.--_Mahawanso_, ch. xxviii. pp. 166, 167.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxii. p. 153.

The poor, unable to\r\nindulge in the luxury of precious metals, found substitutes in shells\r\nand glass; and the extravagance of the taste was defended on the ground\r\nthat their brilliancy served to avert the malignity of \"the evil eye\"\r\nfrom the wearer to the jewel.\r\n\r\n_Gilding_.--Gilding was likewise understood by the Singhalese in all its\r\ndepartments, both as applied to the baser metals and to other\r\nsubstances--wood-work was gilded for preaching places[1] as was also\r\ncopper for roofing, cement for decorating walls, and stone for statuary\r\nand carving.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajaratnacari_, p. 60.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Rock inscription at Pollanarrua, A.D. 187--196.]\r\n\r\n_Coin_.--Although the Singhalese through their sacred writings had a\r\nknowledge of coined money, and of its existence in India from a period\r\nlittle subsequent to the death of Gotama Buddha[1]; and although their\r\nannalists give the names of particular coins in circulation[2], at\r\nvarious times, no Singhalese money has yet been discovered of a date\r\nantecedent to the eleventh century. The Chinese in the fifteenth century\r\nspoke with admiration of the gold pieces struck by the kings of Ceylon,\r\nwhich they found in circulation on their frequent visits to the emporium\r\nat Galle[3]; but of these only a few very rare examples have been\r\npreserved, one of which bears the effigy and name of Lokaiswaira[4], who\r\nusurped the throne during a period of anarchy about A.D. 1070. Numbers\r\nof small copper coins of the eleventh and twelfth centuries have from\r\ntime to time been dug up both in the interior and on the coast of the\r\nisland[5]. A quantity of these which were found in 1848 by Lieutenant\r\nEvatt, when in command of a pioneer corps near the village of Ambogamoa,\r\nwere submitted to Mr. Vaux of the British Museum, and prove to belong to\r\nthe reign of Wijayo Bahu, A.D. 1071, Prakrama I., A.D. 1153, the Queen\r\nLilawatte, A.D. 1197, King Sahasamallawa, A.D. 1200, Darmasoka, A.D.\r\n1208, and Bhuwaneka Bahu, A.D. 1303. These coins have one and all the\r\nsame device on the obverse,--a rude standing figure of the Raja holding\r\nthe _trisula_ in his left hand, and a flower in the right. His dress is\r\na flowing robe, the folds of which are indicated rather than imitated by\r\nthe artist; and on the reverse the same figure is seated, the name in\r\nNagari characters being placed beside the face[6].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The _Mahawanso_ mentions the existence of coined metals in\r\nIndia in the tenth year of the reign of Kalasoka, a century from the\r\ndeath of Buddha, ch. iv. p. 15. According to Hardy, in the most ancient\r\nlaws of the Buddhists the distinction is recognised between coined money\r\nand bullion,--_Eastern Monachism,_ vol. vii. p. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The coins mentioned in the _Mahawanso, Rajaratnacari, and\r\nRajavali_ are as follows: B.C. 161, the _kahapanan (Mahawanso_, ch. xxx.\r\npp. 157, 175), which TURNOUR says was a gold coin worth ten _massakan_\r\nor _massa_. The latter are \"the pieces of gold formerly current in\r\nCeylon,\" a heap of which, according to the _Rajaratnacari_ (p. 48), was\r\nseen by King Bhatia Tissa when he was permitted to penetrate into the\r\nchamber of the Ruanwellé dagoba, A.D. 137. The silver massa, according\r\nto TURNOUR, was valued at eightpence. These are repeatedly mentioned in\r\nthe _Rajaratnacari_ (A.D. 201, p. 60, A.D. 234, p. 62, A.D. 1262, p.\r\n102, A.D. 1301, p. 107, A.D. 1462, p. 113). The _Rajavali_ speaks of\r\n\"gold massa\" as in circulation in the time of Dutugaimunu, B.C. 161 (p.\r\n201). The word _masa_ in Singhalese means \"pulse,\" or any description of\r\n\"beans;\" and it seems not improbable that the origin of the term as\r\napplied to money may be traced to the practice in the early Indian\r\ncoinage of stamping small _lumps_ of metal to give them authentic\r\ncurrency. It can only be a coincidence that the Roman term for an ingot\r\nof gold was \"_massa_\" (Pliny, L. xxxiii. c. 19). These Singhalese massa\r\nwere probably similar to the \"punched coins,\" having rude stamps without\r\neffigies, and rarely even with letters, which have been turned up at\r\nKanooj, Oujein, and other places in Western India. A copper coin is\r\nlikewise mentioned in the fourteenth century, in the _Rajavali_, where\r\nit is termed _carooshawpa_; the value of which UPHAM, without naming his\r\nauthority, says was \"about a pice and a half.\"--p. 136.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Woo hëö pëen_ \"Records of the Ming Dynasty,\" A.D. 1522, B.\r\nlxviii. p. 5. _Suh Wan heen tung kaou_, \"Antiquarian Researches,\" B.\r\nccxxxvi. p. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Two gold coins of Lokaiswaira are in the collection of the\r\nBritish Museum, and will be found described by Mr. VAUX in the 16th vol.\r\nof the _Numismatic Chronicle_, p. 121.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: There is a Singhalese coin figured in DAVY'S _Ceylon_, p.\r\n245, the legend on which is turned upside down, but when reversed it\r\nreads \"_Sri Pa-re-kra-ma Bahu_.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Numismatic Chronicle_, vol. xvi. p. 124]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Kandyans, by whom these coins are frequently found, give the copper\r\npieces the name of Dambedenia _challies_, and tradition, with perfect\r\ncorrectness, assigns them to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when\r\nthe kings of that period are believed to have had a mint at Dambedenia.\r\n\r\nA quantity of coins similar in every respect to those dug up in Ceylon\r\nhave been found at Dipaldinia or Amarawati, on the continent of India,\r\nnear the mouth of the Kistna; a circumstance which might be accounted\r\nfor by the frequent intercourse between Ceylon and the coast, but which\r\nis possibly referable to the fact recorded in the _Mahawanso_ that\r\nPrakrama I., after his successful expedition against the King of Pandya,\r\ncaused money to be coined in his own name before retiring to Ceylon.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxvi. pp. 298, 299, UPHAM's _Trans_. The\r\ncircumstance is exceedingly curious of coins of Prakrama, \"identical\"\r\nwith those found at Dambedenia, in Ceylon, having also been discovered\r\nat Dipaldinia, on the opposite continent; and it goes far to confirm the\r\naccuracy of the _Mahawanso_ as to the same king having coined money in\r\nboth places.

VI.\r\n\r\nENGINEERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown[1] that the natives of Ceylon received their\r\nearliest instruction in engineering from the Brahmans, who attached\r\nthemselves to the followers of Wijayo and his immediate successors.[2]\r\nBut whilst astonished at the vastness of conception observable in the\r\nworks executed at this early period, we are equally struck by the\r\nextreme simplicity of the means employed by their designers for carrying\r\ntheir plans into execution; and the absence of all ingenious expedients\r\nfor husbanding or effectively applying manual labour. The earth which\r\nforms their prodigious embankments was carried in baskets[3] by the\r\nlabourers, in the same primitive fashion which prevails to the present\r\nday. Stones were detached in the quarry by the slow and laborious\r\nprocess of wedging, of which they still exhibit the traces; and those\r\nintended for prominent positions were carefully dressed with iron tools.\r\nFor moving them no mechanical contrivances were resorted to[4], and it\r\ncan only have been by animal power, aided by ropes and rollers, that\r\nvast blocks like the great tablet at Pollanarrua were dragged to their\r\nrequired positions.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Vol. I. Part IV. chap. ii. p. 430.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: King Pandukábhaya, B.C. 437, \"built a residence for the\r\nBrahman Jótiyo, the chief engineer.\"--_Mahawanso_, ch. x. p. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxiii. p. 144.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The only instance of mechanism applied in aid of human\r\nlabour is referred to in a passage of the _Mahawanso_, which alludes to\r\na decree for \"raising the water of the Abhaya tank by means of\r\nmachinery,\" in order to pour it over a dagoba during the solemnisation\r\nof a festival, B.C. 20.--_Mahawanso_, ch. xxxiv. p. 211;\r\n_Rajaratnacari_, p. 51.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: No document is better calculated to Impress the reader with\r\na due appreciation of the indomitable perseverance of the Singhalese in\r\nworks of engineering than the able report of Messrs. ADAMS, CHURCHILL,\r\nand BAILEY, on the great _Canal from Ellahara to Gantalawa_, appended to\r\nthe Ceylon Calendar for 1857.]\r\n\r\n_Fortifications_.--Of military engineering the Singhalese had a very\r\nslight knowledge. Walled towns and fortifications are frequently spoken\r\nof, but the ascertained difficulty of raising, squaring, or carrying\r\nstones, points to the inference which is justified by the expressions of\r\nthe ancient chronicles, that the walls they allude to, must have been\r\nearthworks[1], and that the strength of their fortified places consisted\r\nin their inaccessibility. The first recorded attempt at fortification\r\nwas made by the Malabars in the second century before Christ for the\r\ndefence of Wijitta-poora, which is described as having been secured by\r\nwalls, a fosse, and a gate.[2] Elala about the same period built\r\n\"thirty-two bulwarks\" at Anarajapoora[3]; and Dutugaimunu, in commencing\r\nto besiege him in the city, followed his example, by throwing up a\r\n\"fortification in an open plain,\" at a spot well provided with wood and\r\nwater.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Makalantissa, who reigned B.C. 41, \"built a rampart seven\r\ncubits high, and dug a ditch round the capital.\"--_Mahawanso_, ch.\r\nxxxiv. p. 210.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajavali_, p. 212; _Mahawanso_, ch. xxv. p. 151.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Rajavali_, p. 187.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Rajavali_, p. 216; _Mahawanso_ ch. xxv. p. 152.]\r\n\r\nAt a later time, the Malabars, when in possession of the northern\r\nportion of the island, formed a chain of strong \"forts\" from the eastern\r\nto the western coast, and the Singhalese, in imitation of them, occupied\r\nsimilar positions. The most striking example of mediæval fortification\r\nwhich still survives, is the imperishable rock of Sigiri, north-east of\r\nDambool, to which the infamous Kassyapa retired with his treasures,\r\nafter the assassination of his father, King Dhatu Sena, A.D. 459; when\r\nhaving cleared its vicinity, and surrounded it by a rampart, the figures\r\nof lions with which he decorated it, obtained for it the name of\r\nSihagiri, the \"Lion-rock.\" But the real defences of Sigiri were its\r\nprecipitous cliffs, and its naturally scarped walls, which it was not\r\nnecessary to strengthen by any artificial structures.\r\n\r\nTheir rocky hills, and the almost impenetrable forests which enveloped\r\nthem, were in every age the chief security of the Singhalese; and so\r\nlate as the 12th century, the inscription engraved on the rock at\r\nDambool, in describing the strength of the national defences under the\r\nKing Kirti Nissanga, enumerates them as \"strongholds in the midst of\r\nforests, and those upon steep hills, and the fastnesses surrounded by\r\nwater.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: TURNOUR'S _Epitome and Appendix_, p. 95.]\r\n\r\n_Thorn-gates._--The device, retained down to the period of the capture\r\nof Kandy by the British, when the passes into the hill country were\r\ndefended by thick plantations of formidable thorny trees, appears to\r\nhave prevailed in the earliest times. The protection of Mahelo, a town\r\nassailed by Dutugaimunu, B.C. 162, consisting in its being \"surrounded\r\non all sides with the thorny _dadambo_ creeper, within which was a\r\ntriple line of fortifications.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxv. p. 153. When Albuquerque attacked\r\nMalacca in A.D. 1511, the chief who defended the place \"covered the\r\nstreets with poisoned thorns, to gore the Portuguese coming in\" FARIA Y\r\nSOUZA, vol. i. p. 180. VALENTYN, in speaking of the dominions of the\r\nKing of Kandy during the Dutch occupation of the Low Country, describes\r\nthe density of the forests, \"which not only serve to divide the earldoms\r\none from another, but, above all, tend to the fortification of the\r\ncountry, on which account no one dare, on pain of death, to thin or root\r\nout a tree, more than to permit a passage for one man at a time, it\r\nbeing impossible to pass through the rest thereof.\"--VALENTYN, _Oud en\r\nNieuw Oost-Indien, &c._, ch. i. p. 22. KNOX gives a curious account of\r\nthese \"thorn-gates.\" (Part ii. ch. vi. p. 45.)]\r\n\r\n_Bridges_.--As to bridges, Ceylon had none till the end of the 13th\r\ncentury[1], and Turnour conjectures that even then they were only formed\r\nof timber, like the Pons Sublidus at Rome. At a later period stone\r\npillars were used in pairs, on which beams or slabs were horizontally\r\nrested, in order to form a roadway [2], in the same manner that\r\nHerodotus describes the most ancient bridge on record, which was\r\nconstructed by Queen Nitocris, at Babylon; the planks being laid during\r\nthe day and lifted again at night, for the security of the city.[3] The\r\nprinciple of the arch appears never to have been employed in bridge\r\nbuilding. Ferries, and the taxes on crossing by them, are alluded to\r\ndown to a very late period amongst other sources of revenue.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: TURNOUR'S _Epitome_ and _Notes_, p. 72. Major Forbes says,\r\nhowever, there is reason to believe that the remains of stone piers\r\nacross the Kalawa-oya, on the line between Kornegalle and Anarajapoora,\r\nare the ruins of the bridge erected by King Maha Sen, A.D. 301.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxxv.

The bridge on the Wanny hereafter\r\ndescribed (see vol. ii p. 474) was thus constructed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Herodotus, i. 186.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxiii. pp. 136, 138, ch. xxv. p. 150;\r\n_Rajaratnacari_, p. 112.]\r\n\r\nIn forming the bunds of their reservoirs and of the stone dams which\r\nthey drew across the rivers that were to supply them with water, they\r\nwere accustomed, with incredible toil, infinitely increased by the\r\nimperfection of tools and implements, to work a raised moulding in front\r\nof the blocks of stone, so that each course was retained in position,\r\nnot alone by its own weight, but by the difficulty of forcing it forward\r\nby pressure from behind.\r\n\r\nThe conduits by which the accumulated waters were distributed, required\r\nto be constructed under the bed of the lake, so that the egress should\r\nbe certain and equal[1], as long as any water remained in the tank. To\r\neffect this, they were cut in many instances through solid granite; and\r\ntheir ruins present singular illustrations of determined perseverance,\r\nundeterred by the most discouraging difficulties, and unrelieved by the\r\nslightest appliance of ingenuity to diminish the toil of excavation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Lake of Albano presents an example of a conduit or\r\n\"emissary\" of this peculiar construction to draw off the water. It is\r\nupwards of 6000 feet in length. A similar emissary serves a like purpose\r\nat Lake Nemi.]\r\n\r\nIt cannot but exalt our opinion of a people, to find that, under\r\ndisadvantages so signal, they were capable of forming such a work as the\r\nKalaweva tank, between Anarajapoora and Dambool, which TURNOUR justly\r\nsays, is the greatest of the ancient works in Ceylon. This enormous\r\nreservoir was forty miles in circumference, with an embankment twelve\r\nmiles in extent, and the spill-water, ineffectual for the purpose\r\ndesigned, is \"one of the most stupendous monuments of misapplied human\r\nlabour.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: TURNOUR'S _Mahawanso_, Index, p. xi. This stupendous work\r\nwas constructed A.D. 459. _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxviii. p. 256.]\r\n\r\nWhen to such inherent deficiencies were added the alarms of frequent\r\ninvasion and all the evils of almost incessant occupation by a foreign\r\nenemy, it is only surprising that the Singhalese preserved so long the\r\ndegree of expertness in engineering to which they had originally\r\nattained. No people in any age or country had so great practice and\r\nexperience in the construction of works for irrigation; and so far had\r\nthe renown of their excellence in this branch reached, that in the\r\neighth century, the king of Kashmir, Djaya-pida, \"sent to Ceylon for\r\nengineers to form a lake.\"[1] But after the reign of Prakrama I., the\r\ndecline was palpable and progressive. No great works, either of ornament\r\nor utility, no temples nor inland lakes, were constructed by his\r\nsuccessors; and it is remarkable, that even during his own reign,\r\nartificers were brought from the coast of India to repair the monuments\r\nof Anarajapoora.[2] The last great work attempted for irrigation was\r\nprobably the Giant's Tank, north-east of Aripo; but so much had\r\npractical science declined, that after an enormous expenditure of labour\r\nin damming up the Moeselley river, whose waters were to have been\r\ndiverted to the lake, it was discovered that the levels were unsuitable,\r\nand the work was abandoned in despair.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A.D. 745. _Rajataringini_, b. iv. sl. 502, 505.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, UPHAM'S transl., ch. lxxv. p. 294. This\r\npassage in the _Mahawanso_ might seem to imply that it was as an act of\r\nretribution that Malabars, by whom the monuments had been injured, were\r\ncompelled to restore them. But in ch. lxxvii. it is stated that they\r\nwere brought from India for this purpose, because it \"had been found\r\nimpracticable by other kings to renew and repair them.\"--P. 305.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: For an account of the present condition of the Giant's\r\nTank, see Vol. II. Part x. ch. ii.]\r\n\r\nThe talents of the civil engineer were likewise employed in providing\r\nfor the health and comfort of their towns and the _Dipawanso_, a\r\nchronicle earlier in point of date than the _Mahawanso_, relates that\r\nWasabha, who reigned between A.D. 66 and 110, constructed a tunnel\r\n(\"um-maggo\") for the purpose of supplying Anarajapoora with water.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Journ.

VII.\r\n\r\nTHE FINE ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSIC.--The science and practice of the fine arts were never very highly\r\ndeveloped amongst a people whose domestic refinement became arrested at\r\na very early stage; and whose efforts in that direction were almost\r\nwholly confined to the exaltation of the national faith, and the\r\nembellishment of its temples and monuments.\r\n\r\nTheir knowledge of music was derived from the Hindus, by whom its study\r\nwas regarded as of equal importance with that of medicine and astronomy;\r\nand hence amongst the early Singhalese, along with the other \"eighteen\r\nsciences,\"[1] music was taught as an essential part of the education of\r\na prince.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This fact is curious, seeing that at the present day the\r\ncultivation of music belongs to one of the lowest castes in Ceylon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxiv.; UPHAM'S version, p. 256. An\r\ningenious paper on _Singhalese Music_, by Mr. Louis Nell, is printed in\r\nthe _Journ._ of the Ceylon branch of the _Roy. Asiat. Soc._ for 1856-8;\r\np. 200.]\r\n\r\nBut unlike the soft melodies of Hindustan, whose characteristic is their\r\ngentle and soothing effect, the music of the Singhalese appears to have\r\nconsisted of sound rather than of harmony; modulation and expression\r\nhaving been at all times subordinate to volume and metrical effect.\r\n\r\nReverberating instruments were their earliest inventions for musical\r\npurposes, and those most frequently alluded to in their chronicles are\r\ndrums, resembling the tom-toms used in the temples to the present day.\r\nThe same variety of form prevailed then as now, and the _Rajavali_\r\nrelates, in speaking of the army of Dutugaimunu, that in its march, the\r\n\"rattling of the sixty-four kinds of drums made a noise resembling\r\nthunder breaking on the rock from behind which the sun rises.\"[1] The\r\nband of Devenipiatissa, B.C. 307, was called the _talawachara_, from the\r\nmultitude of drums[2]: chank-shells contributed to swell the din, both\r\nin warfare[3] and in religious worship[4]; choristers added their\r\nvoices[5]; and the triumph of effect consisted in \"the united crash of\r\nevery description, vocal as well as instrumental\"[6] Although \"a full\r\nband\" is explained in the _Mahawanso_ to imply a combination of \"all\r\ndescriptions of musicians,\" no flutes or wind instruments are\r\nparticularised, and the incidental mention of a harp only occurs in the\r\nreign of Dutugaimunu, B.C. 161.[7] JOINVILLE says, that certain musical\r\nprinciples were acknowledged in Ceylon at an early period, and that\r\npieces are to be seen in some of the old Pali books in regular\r\nnotation; the gamut, which was termed _septa souere_, consisting of\r\nseven notes, and expressed not by signs, but in letters equivalent to\r\ntheir pronunciation, _sa, ri, ga, me, qa, de, ni._[8] At the present\r\nday, harmony is still superseded by sound, the singing of the Singhalese\r\nbeing a nasal whine, not unlike that of the Arabs. Flutes, almost\r\ninsusceptible of modulation, chanks, which give forth a piercing scream,\r\nand the overpowering roll of tom-toms, constitute the music of the\r\ntemples; and all day long the women of a family will sit round a species\r\nof timbrel, called _rabani_, and produce from it the most monotonous,\r\nbut to their ear, most agreeable noises, by drumming with the fingers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajavali_, pp. 217, 219. At the present day, there are\r\nfour or five varieties of drums in use:--the tom-tom or _tam-a-tom_,\r\nproperly so-called, which consists of two cylinders placed side by side,\r\nand is beaten with two sticks;--the _daelle_, a single cylinder struck\r\nwith a stick at one end, and with the hand at the other,--the\r\n_oudaelle_, which is held in the left hand, and struck with the\r\nright;--and the _berri_, which is suspended from the beater's neck, and\r\nstruck with both hands, one at each end, precisely as a similar\r\ninstrument is shown in some of the Egyptian monuments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT EGYPTIAN AND MODERN SINGHALESE TOM-TOM BEATERS.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xvii, p. 104.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: B.C. 161. _Mahawanso_, ch. xxv, p. 154.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: B.C. 20. _Rajavali_, p. 51.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxv. p. 157.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxvi. 186.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxx. p. 180. The following passage in\r\nUPHAM'S translation of the _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxii. vol. i. p. 274, would\r\nconvey the idea that the Æolian harp was meant, or some arrangement of\r\nstrings calculated to elicit similar sounds:--\"The king Prakrama built a\r\npalace at the city of Pollanarrua; and the stone works were carved in\r\nthe shape of flowers and creeping plants, _with golden networks which\r\ngave harmonious sounds as if they were moved by the air_.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: JOINVILLE, _Asiat. Researches_, vol. vii. p. 488.]\r\n\r\n_Painting_.--Painting, whether historical or imaginative, is only\r\nmentioned in connection with the decoration of temples, and no examples\r\nsurvive of sufficient antiquity to exhibit the actual state of the art\r\nat any remote period. But enough is known of the trammels imposed upon\r\nall art, to show that from the earliest times, imagination and invention\r\nwere prohibited by the priesthood; and although execution and facility\r\nmay have varied at different eras, design and composition were\r\nstationary and unalterable.\r\n\r\nLike the priesthood of Egypt, those of Ceylon regulated the mode of\r\ndelineating the effigies of their divine teacher, by a rigid formulary,\r\nwith which they combined corresponding directions for the drawing of the\r\nhuman figure in connection with sacred subjects. In the relics of\r\nEgyptian painting and sculpture, we find \"that the same formal outline,\r\nthe same attitudes and postures of the body, the same conventional modes\r\nof representing the different parts, were adhered to at the latest, as\r\nat the earliest periods. No improvements were admitted; no attempts to\r\ncopy nature or to give an air of action to the limbs. Certain rules and\r\ncertain models had been established by law, and the faulty conceptions\r\nof early times were copied and perpetuated by every succeeding\r\nartist.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: SIR GARDNER WILKINSON'S _Ancient Egyptians_, vol. iii. ch.\r\nx. p. 87, 264.]\r\n\r\nThe same observations apply, almost in the same terms, to the paintings\r\nof the Singhalese. The historical delineations of the exploits of Gotama\r\nBuddha and of his disciples and attendants, which at the present day\r\ncover the walls of the temples and wiharas, follow, with rigid\r\nminuteness, pre-existing illustrations of the sacred narratives. They\r\nappear to have been copied, with a devout adherence to colour, costume,\r\nand detail, from designs which from time immemorial have represented the\r\nsame subjects; and emaciated ascetics, distorted devotees, beatified\r\nsimpletons, and malefactors in torment are depicted with a painful\r\nfidelity, akin to modern pre-Raphaelitism.\r\n\r\nOwing to this discouragement of invention, one series of pictures is so\r\nservile an imitation of another, that design has never improved in\r\nCeylon; one scene is but the facsimile of a previous one, and each may\r\nalmost be regarded as an exponent of the state of the art at any\r\npreceding period.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Egyptians and Singhalese were not, however, the only\r\nauthorities who overwhelmed invention by ecclesiastical conventionalism.\r\nThe early artists of Greece were not at liberty to follow the bent of\r\ntheir own genius, or to depart from established regulations in\r\nrepresenting the figures of the gods. In the middle ages, the influence\r\nof the churches, both of Rome and Byzantium, was productive of a similar\r\nresult; and although the Latins early emancipated themselves, the\r\npainters of the Greek church, to the present hour, labour under the\r\nidentical trammels which crippled art at Constantinople a thousand years\r\nago. M. DIDRON, who visited the churches and monasteries of Greece in\r\n1839, makes the remark that \"ni le temps ni le lieu ne font rien à l'art\r\nGrec: au XVIIIe siècle, le peintre Moréote continue et calque le peintre\r\nVénétien du Xe, le peintre Athonite du Ve ou VIe. Le costume des\r\npersonnages est partout et en tout temps le même, non-seulement pour la\r\nforme, mais pour la couleur, mais pour le dessin, mais jusque pour le\r\nnombre et l'épaisseur des plis. On ne saurait pousser plus loin\r\nl'exactitude traditionnelle, l'esclavage du passé.\" _(Manuel d'\r\nIconographie Chrétienne Grecque et Latin_, p. ix.) The explanation of\r\nthis fact is striking. Mount Athos is the grand manufactory of pictures\r\nfor the Greek churches throughout the world; and M. DIDRON found the\r\nartists producing, with the servility and almost the rapidity of\r\nmachinery, endless facsimiles of pictures in rigid conformity with a\r\nrecognised code of instructions drawn up under ecclesiastical authority\r\nand entitled [Greek: Ermêneia tês Zographikês], \"The Guide for\r\nPainting,\" a literal translation of which he has published. This very\r\ncurious manuscript contains minute directions for the figures, costume,\r\nand attitude of the sacred characters, and for the preparation of many\r\nhundreds of historical subjects required for the decoration of churches.\r\nThe artist, when solicited by M. Didron to sell \"cette bible de son\r\nart,\" naively refused, on the simple ground that \"s'il se dépouillait de\r\nce livre, il ne pourrait plus rien faire; en perdaut son Guide, il\r\nperdait son art, il perdait ses yeux et ses mains\" (_ib_. p. xxiii.). It\r\nwas not till the fifteenth century that the painters of Italy shook\r\nthemselves free of the authority of the Latin church in matters of art.\r\nThe second council of Nice arrogates to the Roman church the authority\r\nin such matters still retained by the Greek; \"non est imaginum structura\r\npictorum inventio sed ecclesiæ catholicæ probata legislatio et\r\ntraditio.\" In Spain, the sacro-pictorial law, under the title of _Pictor\r\nChristianus_, was promulgated, in 1730, by Fray Juan de Ayala, a monk of\r\nthe order of Mercy; and such subjects are discussed as the shape of the\r\ntrue cross; whether one or two angels should sit on the stone by the\r\nsepulchre? and whether the Devil should be drawn with horns and a tail?\r\nIn the National Gallery of London there is a painting of the Holy Family\r\nby Benozzo Gozzoli, and Sir Charles L. Eastlake has permitted me to see\r\na contract between the painter and his employer A.D. 1461, in which\r\nevery figure is literally \"made to order,\" its attitude bespoke, and its\r\nplace in the composition distinctly agreed for. One clause, however,\r\ncontemplates progress, and binds the painter to make the piece his\r\nchef-d'oeuvre--\"che detta dipentura exceda ogni buona dipintura infino\r\naqui facto per detto Benozzo.\"]\r\n\r\nHence even the most modern embellishments in the temples have an air of\r\nremote antiquity. The colours are tempered with gum; and but for their\r\ninferiority in drawing the human figure, as compared with the Egyptians,\r\nand their defiance of the laws of perspective, their inharmonious tints,\r\ncoupled with the whiteness of the ground-work, would remind one of\r\nsimilar peculiarities in the paintings in the Thebaid, and the caves of\r\nBeni Hassan.\r\n\r\nFa Hian describes in the fourth century precisely the same series of\r\nsubjects and designs which are delineated in the temples of the present\r\nday, and taken from the transformation of Buddha. With hundreds of\r\nthese, he says, painted in appropriate colours and executed in imitation\r\nof life, the king caused both sides of the road to be decorated on the\r\noccasion of religious processions.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Foe Koue Ki_, ch. xxxviii. p. 335.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the most renowned of the Singhalese masters, was the King Detu\r\nTissa, A.D. 330, \"a skilful carver, who executed many arduous\r\nundertakings in painting, and taught it to his subjects. He modelled a\r\nstatue of Buddha so exquisitely that he seemed to have been inspired;\r\nand for it he made an altar, and gilt an edifice inlaid with ivory.\"[1]\r\nAmong the presents sent by the King of Ceylon (A.D. 459) to the Emperor\r\nof China, the _Tsih foo yuen kwei_, a chronicle compiled by imperial\r\ncommand, particularises a picture of Buddha.[2] The colours employed in\r\ndecorating their temples are mixed in _tempera_, as were those used in\r\nthe ancient paintings in Egypt; the claim of the Singhalese to the\r\npriority of invention in the mixture of colours with oil, is adverted to\r\nelsewhere.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxvii. p. 242.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: B. li. p. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See the chapter on the Fine Arts, Vol. I. p. 490.]\r\n\r\n_Sculpture_.--In style Singhalese sculpture was even more conventional\r\nand less imaginative than their painting; since the subjects to which it\r\nwas confined were almost exclusively statues of Buddha[1], and its\r\nefforts were mere repetitions of the three orthodox attitudes of the\r\ngreat archetype--_sitting_, as when in deep meditation, under the sacred\r\nBo-tree; _standing_, as when exhorting his multitudinous disciples; and\r\n_reclining_, in the enjoyment of the everlasting repose of \"nirwana.\" In\r\neach and all of these the details are identical; the length of the ears,\r\nthe proportions of the arms, fingers, and toes; the colour of the eyes,\r\nand the curls of the hair[2] being repeated with wearisome iteration. To\r\nsuch an extent were these multiplied, and with an adherence so rigid to\r\nthe same recognised models, that the _Rajavali_ ventures to ascribe to\r\none king the erection of \"seventy-two thousand statues of Buddha,\" an\r\nobvious error[3], but indicative, nevertheless, that the real amount\r\nmust have been prodigious, in order to obtain credence for the\r\nexaggeration. Many other sovereigns are extolled in the national annals,\r\nwho rendered their reigns illustrious by the multiplicity of statues\r\nwhich they placed in the temples. It was doubtless from this incessant\r\nstudy of one and the same figure, that the artists of Ceylon attained to\r\na facility and superiority in producing statues of Buddha, that rendered\r\nthem famous throughout the countries of Asia, in which his religion\r\nprevailed. The early historians of China speak in raptures of works of\r\nthis kind, obtained from Singhalese sculptors in the fourth and fifth\r\ncenturies; they were eagerly sought after by all the surrounding\r\nnations; and one peculiarity in their execution consisted in so treating\r\nthe features, that \"on standing at about ten paces distant they appeared\r\ntruly brilliant, but the lineaments gradually disappeared on a nearer\r\napproach.\"[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mention is made of a figure of an elephant (_Rajavali_, p.\r\n242), and of a horse (_Mahawanso_, ch. xxxix. TURNOUR'S manuscript\r\ntranslation), and a carved bull as amongst the ruins of Anarajapoora.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: M. ABEL REMUSAT has devoted a section of his _Melanges\r\nAsiatiques_, 1825; vol. i. p. 100, to combating the conjecture of Sir W.\r\nJONES in his third Dissertation on the Hindus, drawn from the curled or\r\nrather the woolly hair represented in his statues, that Buddha drew his\r\ndescent from an African origin. (_Works_, vol. i. p, 12.) Another ground\r\nfor Sir. W. JONES'S conjecture was the _large ears_ which are usually\r\ncharacteristic of the statues of Buddha. But it is curious that one of\r\nthe peculiar features ascribed to the Singhalese by the early Greek\r\nwriters was the possession of pendulous ears, possibly occasioned by\r\ntheir heavy ear-rings.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Rajavali_, p. 255. Most of these were built of terra-cotta\r\nand cement covered with chunam, preparatory to being painted. See p.\r\n478.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Wei shoo_, a \"History of the Wei Tartar Dynasty,\" written\r\nA.D. 590. B. cxiv. p. 9.]\r\n\r\nThe labours of the sculptor and painter were combined in producing these\r\nimages of Buddha, which are always coloured in imitation of life, each\r\ntint of his complexion and hair being in religious conformity with\r\ndivine authority, and the ceremony of \"painting of the eyes,\"[1] is\r\nalways observed by the devout Buddhists as a solemn festival.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxii.; UPHAM'S version, vol. i. p. 275.]\r\n\r\nMany of the works which were thus executed were either golden[1] or\r\ngilt, with brilliants inserted in the eyes, and the draperies enriched\r\nwith jewels.[2] Fa Hian in the fourth century, speaks of a figure of\r\nBuddha upwards of twenty-three feet in height, formed out of blue\r\njasper, and set with precious stones, that sparkled with singular\r\nsplendour, and which bore in its right hand a pearl of priceless\r\nvalue.[3] This may possibly have been the statue of which the\r\n_Mahawanso_ speaks in like terms of admiration: \"the eye formed by a\r\njewel from the royal head-dress, each curl of the hair by a sapphire,\r\nand the lock in the centre of the forehead by threads of gold.\"[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxx. pp. 180, 182; _Rajaratnacari_, pp.\r\n47, 48; _Rajavali_, p. 237.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxviii. p. 258.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"Parmi toutes les choses précieuses qu'on y voit, il y a\r\nune image de jaspe bleu haute de deux _tchang_: tout son corps est formé\r\ndes sept choses précieuses; elle est étincellante de splendeur et plus\r\nmajestueuse qu'on ne saurait l'exprimer. Dans la main droite elle tient\r\nune perle d'un prix inestimable.\"--_Foe Koue Ki_, ch. xxxviii. p. 333.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: A.D. 459. _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxviii. p. 258. Another statue\r\nof gold, with the features and members appropriately coloured in gems,\r\nis spoken of in the second century B.C. (_Mahawanso_, ch. xxx. p. 180.)]\r\n\r\nIvory also and sandal-wood[1], as well as copper and bronze, served as\r\nmaterials for statues; but granite was the substance most generally\r\nselected, except in the rare instances where the temple and the statue\r\ntogether were hewn out of the living rock, on which occasions gneiss was\r\nmost generally selected. Such are the statues at Pollanarrua, at\r\nMihintala, and at the Aukana Wihara, near Wijittapoora. A still more\r\ncommon expedient, which is employed to the present time, was to form the\r\nfigures of Buddha with pieces of burnt clay joined together by cement;\r\nand coated with highly polished chunam, in order to prepare the surface\r\nfor the painter. In this manner were most probably produced the\r\n\"seventy-two thousand statues\" ascribed to Mihindo V.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajaratnacari_, p. 72.]\r\n\r\nFigures of elephants were similarly formed at an early period.[1] An\r\nimage of Buddha so composed in the 12th century, is still standing at\r\nPollanarrua[2], and every temple has one or more effigies, either\r\nsedent, erect, or recumbent, carefully modelled in cemented clay, and\r\ncoloured after life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A.D. 432. _Rajaratnacari_, p. 74.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Possibly the \"standing figure of Buddha\" mentioned in the\r\n_Rajavali_, p. 253.]\r\n\r\n_Architecture_.--In Ceylon, as in Egypt, Assyria, and India, the ruins\r\nwhich survive to attest the character of ancient architecture are\r\nexclusively sacred, with the exception of occasional traces of the\r\nresidences of theocratic royalty; but everything has perished which\r\ncould have afforded an idea of the dwellings and domestic architecture\r\nof the people. The cause of this is to be traced in the perishable\r\nnature of the sun-dried clay, of which the walls of the latter were\r\ncomposed. Added to this, in Ceylon there were the pride of rank and the\r\npretensions of the priesthood, which, whilst they led to lavish\r\nexpenditure of the wealth of the kingdom upon palaces and monuments, and\r\nthe employment of stone in the erection of temples[1] and monasteries,\r\nforbade the people to construct their dwellings of any other material\r\nthan sun-baked earth.[2] This practice continued to the latest period;\r\nand nothing struck the British army of occupation with more surprise on\r\nentering the city of Kandy, after its capture in 1815, than to find the\r\npalaces and temples alone constructed of stone, whilst the streets and\r\nprivate houses were formed of mud and thatch.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajaratnacari_, pp. 78, 79.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajavali_, p. 222.]\r\n\r\nThough stone is abundant in Ceylon, it was but sparingly used in the\r\nancient buildings. Squared stones[1] were occasionally employed, but\r\nlarge slabs seldom occur, except in the foundations of dagobas. The vast\r\nquantity of material required for such structures, the cost of quarrying\r\nand carriage, and the want of mechanical aids to raise ponderous blocks\r\ninto position, naturally led to the substitution of bricks for the upper\r\nportion of the superstructure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajavali_, p. 210; VALENTYN, _Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indien_,\r\nch. iii. p. 45.]\r\n\r\nThere is evidence to show that wedges were employed in detaching the\r\nblocks in the quarry, and the amount of labour devoted to the\r\npreparation of those in which strength, irrespective of ornament, was\r\nessential, is shown in the remains of the sixteen hundred undressed\r\npillars[1] which supported the Brazen Palace at Anarajapoora, and in the\r\neighteen hundred stone steps, many of them exceeding ten feet in length,\r\nwhich led from the base of the mountain to the very summit of Mihintala.\r\nA single piece of granite lies at Anarajapoora hollowed into an\r\n\"elephant trough,\" with ornamental pilasters, which measures ten feet in\r\nlength by six wide and two deep; and amongst the ruins of Pollanarrua a\r\nstill more remarkable slab, twenty-five feet in length by six broad and\r\ntwo feet thick, bears an inscription of the twelfth century, which\r\nrecords that it was brought from a distance of more than thirty miles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The _Rajavali_ states that these rough pillars were\r\noriginally covered with copper, p. 222.]\r\n\r\nThe majority of the columns at Anarajapoora are of dressed stone,\r\noctangular and of extremely graceful proportions. They were used in\r\nprofusion to form circular colonnades around the principal dagobas, and\r\nthe vast numbers which still remain upright, are one of the peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of the place, and justify the expression of Knox, when,\r\nspeaking of similar groups elsewhere, he calls them a \"world of hewn\r\nstone pillars.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Knox, _Relation_, vol. v. pt. iv. ch. ii. p. 165.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLUMN AT ANARAJAPOORA.]\r\n\r\nAllusions in the _Mahawanso_ show that extreme care was taken in the\r\npreparation of bricks for the dagobas.[1] Major SKINNER, whose official\r\nduties as engineer to the government have rendered him familiar with all\r\nparts of Ceylon, assures me that the bricks in every ruin he has seen,\r\nincluding the dagobas at Anarajapoora, Bintenne, and Pollanarrua, have\r\nbeen fired with so much skill that exposure through successive centuries\r\nhas but slightly affected their sharpness and consistency.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxviii. p. 165; ch. xxix. p. 169, &c.]\r\n\r\nThe sand for mortar was \"pounded, sifted, and ground on a\r\ngrinding-stone;\"[1] the \"cloud-coloured stones,\"[2] used to form the\r\nimmediate receptacle in which a sacred relic was enclosed, were said to\r\nhave been imported from India; and the \"nawanita\" clay, in which these\r\nwere imbedded, was believed to have been brought from the mythical\r\nAnotattho lake in the Himalayas.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxx. p. 175.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The \"cloud-coloured stone\" may possibly have been marble,\r\nbut no traces of marble have been found in the ruins. Diodorus, in\r\ndescribing some of the monuments of Egypt alludes to a \"party-coloured\"\r\nstone, [Greek: lithon poikilon], which likewise remains without\r\nidentification.--_Diodorus_, l. i. c. lvii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxix. p. 169; ch. xxx. p. 179.]\r\n\r\n_Dagobas_.--The process of building the Ruanwellé dagoba is thus\r\nminutely described in the _Mahawanso_: \"That the structure might endure\r\nfor ages, a foundation was excavated to the depth of one hundred cubits,\r\nand the round stones were trampled by enormous elephants, whose feet\r\nwere protected by leather cases. Over this the monarch spread the sacred\r\nclay, and on it laid the bricks, and over them a coating of astringent\r\ncement, above this a layer of sand-stones, and on all a plate of iron.\r\nOver this was a large pholika (crystallised stone), then a plate of\r\nbrass, eight inches thick, embedded in a cement made of the gum of the\r\nwood-apple tree, diluted in the water of the small red coco-nut.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxix. p. 169; ch. xxx. p. 178. The\r\ninternal structure of the Sanchi tope at Bilsah in Central India\r\npresents the arrangement here described, _the bricks being laid in mud_,\r\nbut externally it is faced with dressed stone.]\r\n\r\nThe shape of these huge mounds of masonry was originally hemispherical,\r\nbeing that best calculated to prevent the growth of grass or other weeds\r\non objects so sacred. Dutugaimumi, according to the _Mahawanso_, when\r\nabout to build the Ruanwellé dagoba, consulted a mason as to the most\r\nsuitable form, who, \"filling a golden dish with water, and taking some\r\nin the palm of his hand, caused a bubble in the form of a coral bead to\r\nrise on the surface; and he replied to the king, 'In this form will I\r\nconstruct it.'\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxx. p. 175. This legend as to the origin\r\nof the semicircular form of the dagoba is at variance with the\r\nconjecture of Major FORBES, that these vast structures were merely an\r\nadvance on the mounds of earth similar to the barrow of Halyattes, which\r\nin the progress of the constructive arts, came to be converted into\r\nbrickwork.--_Eleven Years in Ceylon_, v. i. p. 222.]\r\n\r\nTwo dagobas at Anarajapoora, the Abay-a-giri and Jeyta-wana-rama, still\r\nretain their original outline,--the Ruanwellé, from age and decay, has\r\npartly lost it,--and the Thupa-ramaya is flattened on the top as if\r\nsuddenly brought to a close, and the Lanka-ramaya is shaped like a bell.\r\n\r\n_Monasteries and Wiharas._--According to the annals of Ceylon the\r\nconstruction of dwellings for the devotees of Buddha preceded the\r\nerection of temples for his worship. Originally the anchorite selected a\r\ncave or some shelter in the forest as his place of repose or\r\nmeditation.[1] In the _Rajavali_ Devenipiatissa is said to have \"caused\r\ncaverns to be cut in the solid rock at the sacred place of\r\nMihintala;\"[2] and these are the earliest residences for the higher\r\norders of the priesthood in Ceylon, of which a record has been\r\npreserved. A less costly substitute was found in the erection of\r\ndetached huts of the rudest construction, in winch may be traced the\r\nembryo of the Buddhist monastery; and the king Walagambahu was the\r\nfirst, B.C. 89, to gather these scattered residences into groups and\r\n\"build wiharas in unbroken ranges, conceiving that thus their repairs\r\nwould be more easily effected.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_ c. xxx. p. 174.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajavali_, p. 184.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxiii. p. 207.]\r\n\r\nSimplicity and retirement were at all times the characteristics of these\r\nretreats, which rarely aspired to architectural display; and the only\r\nrecorded instance of extravagance in this particular was the \"Brazen\r\nPalace\" at Anarajapoora, with its sixteen hundred columns; an edifice\r\nwhich, though nominally a dwelling for the priesthood, appears to have\r\nbeen in reality a vast suite of halls for their assemblies and\r\nfestivals, and a sanctuary for the safe custody of their jewels and\r\ntreasure.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch, xxvii. p. 103. Like the \"nine-storied\"\r\npagodas of China, the palace of \"the Lowa Maya Paya\" was originally\r\n_nine stories_ in height, and Fergusson, from the analogy of Buddhist\r\nbuildings in other countries, supposes that these diminished in\r\nsuccession as the building arose, till the outline of the whole assumed\r\nthe form of a pyramid. _(Handbook of Architecture_, b. i. ch. iii. p.\r\n44.) In this he is undoubtedly correct, and a building still existing,\r\nthough in ruins, at Pollanarrua, and known as the _Sat-mal-pasado_, or\r\nthe _\"seven-storied palace_,\" probably built by Prakrama, about the year\r\n1170, serves to support his conjecture. See a description of it, part x.\r\nch. i, vol. ii.]\r\n\r\nAllusions are occasionally made to other edifices more or less fantastic\r\nin their design and structure, such as \"an apartment built on a single\r\npillar,\"[1] a \"house of an octangular form,\" built in the 12th\r\ncentury[2], and another of an \"oval,\" shape[3], erected by Prakrama I.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: B.C. 504, _Mahawanso_, ch. ix, p. 56; ch. lxxii. UPHAM'S\r\nversion, p. 274.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajaratnacari_, p. 105.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxii, UPHAM'S version, p. 274.]\r\n\r\n_Palaces_.--The royal residences as they were first constructed, must\r\nhave consisted of very few chambers, since mention is made in the\r\n_Mahawanso_ of the earliest, which contained \"many apartments,\" having\r\nbeen built by Pandukábhaya, B.C. 437.[1] But within two centuries\r\nafterwards, Dutugaimunu conceived the magnificent idea of the Loha\r\nPasada, with its quadrangle one hundred cubits square, and a thousand\r\ndormitories with ornamental windows.[2] This palace was in its turn\r\nsurpassed by the castle of Prakrama I. at Pollanarrua, which, according\r\nto the _Mahawanso_, \"was seven stories high, consisting of five thousand\r\nrooms, lined with hundreds of stone columns, and outer halls of an oval\r\nshape, with large and small gates, staircases, and glittering walls.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Ibid., ch. x. p. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Ibid., ch. xxvii, p. 163.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxii. UPHAM'S version, p. 274.]\r\n\r\nIn what now remains of these buildings at Anarajapoora, there is no\r\ntrace to be found of an arch, truly turned and secured by its keystone;\r\nbut at Pollanarrua there are several examples of the false arch,\r\nproduced by the progressive projection of the layers of brick.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: FORBES'S _Eleven Years in Ceylon_, vol. i. ch. xvii. p.\r\n414.]\r\n\r\nThe finest specimens of ancient brickwork are to be seen amongst the\r\nruins of the latter city, where the material is compact and smooth, and\r\nthe edges sharp and unworn. The mortar shows the remains of the pearl\r\noyster-shells from which it was burnt, and the chunam with which the\r\nwalls were coated, still clings to some of the towers, and retains its\r\nangularity and polish.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Expressions in the _Mahawanso_, ch. xxvii. p. 104, show\r\nthat as early as the 2nd century, B.C., the Singhalese were acquainted\r\nwith this beautiful cement, which is susceptible of a polish almost\r\nequal to marble.]\r\n\r\nOf the details of external and internal decoration applied to these\r\nbuildings, descriptions are given which attest a perception of taste,\r\nhowever distorted by the exaggerations of oriental design. \"Gilded\r\ntiles\"[1] in their bright and sunny atmosphere, must have had a striking\r\neffect, especially when surmounting walls decorated with beaded\r\nmouldings, and festooned with \"carvings in imitation of creeping plants\r\nand flowers.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajavali_, p. 73.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxii. p. 274.]\r\n\r\n_Carving in stone._--Carving appears to have been practised at a very\r\nearly period with singular success; but in later times it became so\r\ndeteriorated, that there is little difficulty at the present day, in\r\npronouncing on the superiority of the specimens remaining at\r\nAnarajapoora, over those which are to be found amongst the ruins of the\r\nlater capitals, Pollanarrua, Yapahu, or Komegalle. The author of the\r\n_Mahawanso_ dwells with obvious satisfaction on his descriptions of the\r\n\"stones covered with flowers and creeping plants.\"[1] Animals are\r\nconstantly introduced in the designs executed on stone, and a mythical\r\ncreature, called technically _makara-torana_, is conspicuous, especially\r\non doorways and balustrades, with the head of an elephant, the teeth of\r\na crocodile, the feet of a lion, and the tail of a fish.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxii. p. 274, UPHAM'S version.]\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the great wihara, at Anarajapoora, there is now lying\r\non the ground a semi-circular slab of granite, the ornaments of which\r\nare designed in excellent taste, and executed with singular skill;\r\nelephants, lions, horses, and oxen, forming the outer border; that\r\nwithin consisting of a row of the \"hanza,\" or sacred goose; a bird that\r\nis equally conspicuous on the vast tablet, one of the wonders of\r\nPollanarrua, before alluded to.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A sketch of this stone will be seen in the engraving of the\r\nSat-mal-prasada, in the account of Pollanarrua. Part I. ch. i. vol. ii.]\r\n\r\nTaken in connection with the proverbial contempt for the supposed\r\nstolidity of the _goose_, there is something still unexplained in the\r\nextraordinary honours paid to it by the ancients, and the veneration in\r\nwhich it is held to the present day by some of the eastern nations. The\r\nfigure that occurs so frequently on Buddhist monuments, is the Brahmanee\r\ngoose (_casarka rutila_), which is not a native of Ceylon; but from time\r\nimmemorial has been an object of veneration there and in all parts of\r\nIndia. Amongst the Buddhists especially, impressed as they are with the\r\nsolemn obligation of solitary retirement for meditation, the hanza has\r\nattracted attention by its periodical migrations, which are supposed to\r\nbe directed to the holy Lake of Manasa, in the mythical regions of the\r\nHimalaya. The poet Kalidas, in his _Cloud Messenger_, speaks of the\r\nhanza as \"eager to set out for the Sacred Lake.\" Hence, according to the\r\n_Rajavali_, the lion was pre-eminent amongst beasts, \"the _hanza_ was\r\nking over all the feathered tribes.\"[1] In one of the Jatakas, which\r\ncontains the legend of Buddha's apotheosis, his hair, when suspended in\r\nthe sky, is described as resembling \"the beautiful Kala hanza.\"[2] The\r\ngoose is, at the present day, the national emblem emblazoned on the\r\nstandard of Burmah, and the brass weights of the Burmese are generally\r\ncut in the shape of the sacred bird, just as the Egyptians formed their\r\nweights of stone after the same model.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajavali_, p. 149. The _Mahawanso_, ch. xxx. p. 179, also\r\nspeaks of the \"_hanza_,\" as amongst the decorations chased on the stem\r\nof a bo-tree, modelled in gold, which was deposited by Dutugaimunu when\r\nbuilding the Ruanwellé dagoba at Anarajapoora in the 2nd century before\r\nChrist.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: HARDY'S _Buddhism_, ch. vii p. 161.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See SYME'S _Embassy to Ava_, p. 330; YULE'S _Narrative of\r\nthe British Mission to Ava in 1855_, p. 110. I have seen a stone in the\r\nform of a goose, found in the ruins of Nineveh, which appears to have\r\nbeen used as a weight.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From the Burmese standard.]\r\n\r\nAugustine, in his _Civitas Dei_, traces the respect for the goose,\r\ndisplayed by the Romans, to their gratitude for the safety of the\r\ncapital; when the vigilance of this bird defeated the midnight attack by\r\nthe Goths. The adulation of the citizens, he says, degenerated\r\nafterwards almost to Egyptian superstition, in the rites instituted in\r\nhonour of their preservers on that occasion.[1] But the very fact that\r\nthe geese which saved the citadel were already sacred to Juno, and\r\ndomesticated in her temple, demonstrates the error of Augustine, and\r\nshows that they had acquired mythological eminence, before achieving\r\npolitical renown. It must be observed, too, that the birds which\r\nrendered that memorable service, were the ordinary white geese of\r\nEurope[2], and not the red goose of the Nile (the [Greek: chênalôpêx] of\r\nHerodotus), which, ages before, had been enrolled amongst the animals\r\nheld sacred in Egypt, and which formed the emblem of Seb, the father of\r\nOsiris.[3] HORAPOLLO, endeavouring to account for this predilection of\r\nthe Egyptians (who employed the goose hieroglyphically to denote _a\r\nson_), ascribes it to their appreciation of the love evinced by it for\r\nits offspring, in exposing itself to divert the attention of the fowler\r\nfrom its young.[4] This opinion was shared by the Greeks and the Romans.\r\nAristotle praises its sagacity; Ælian dilates on the courage and cunning\r\nof the \"vulpanser,\" and its singular attachment to man[5]; and Ovid\r\nranks the goose as superior to the dog in the scale of intelligence,--\r\n\r\n  \"Soliciti canes canibusve sagacior anser.\"\r\n  OVID, _Met_. xi. 399.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"And hereupon did Rome fall almost into the superstition of\r\nthe Ægyptians that worship birds and beasts, for they _henceforth_ kept\r\na holy day which they call the _goose's feast_.\"--AUGUSTINE, _Civitas\r\nDei, &c._ book ii. ch. 22: Englished by F.H. Icond. 1610.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This appears from a line of Lucretius:\r\n\r\n  \"Romulidarum arcis servator _candidus_ anser.\"\r\n  _De Rer. Nat._ I. iv. 687.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: SIR GARDNER WILKINSON'S _Manners and Customs, &c._, 2nd\r\nSer. pl. 31, fig. 2, vol. i. p. 312; vol. ii. p. 227. Mr. Birch of the\r\nBritish Museum informs me that throughout the ritual or hermetic books\r\nof the ancient Egyptians a mystical notion is attached to the goose as\r\none of the creatures into which the dead had to undergo a\r\ntransmigration. That it was actually worshipped is attested by a\r\nsepulchral tablet of the 26th dynasty, about 700 B.C., in which it is\r\nfigured standing on a small chapel over which are the hieroglyphic\r\nwords, \"_The good goose greatly beloved;_\" and on the lower part of the\r\ntablet the dedicator makes an offering of fire and water to \"_Ammon and\r\nthe Goose._\"--_Revue Archæo._, vol. ii. pl. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: HORAPOLLO, _Hieroglyphica_, lib. i. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: ÆLIAN, _Nat. Hist._, lib. v. c. 29, 30, 50. Ælian says that\r\nthe Romans in recognition of the superior vigilance of the goose on the\r\noccasion of the assault on the Capitol, instituted a procession in the\r\nForum in honour of the goose, whose watchfulness was incorruptible; but\r\nheld an annual denunciation of the inferior fidelity of the dogs, which\r\nallowed themselves to be silenced by meat flung to them by the\r\nGauls.--_Nat. Hist._ lib. xii. ch. xxxiii.]\r\n\r\nThe feeling appears to have spread westward at an early period; the\r\nancient Britons, according to Cæsar, held it impious to eat the flesh of\r\nthe goose[1], and the followers of the first crusade which issued from\r\nEngland, France, and Flanders, adored a goat and _a goose_, which they\r\nbelieved to be filled by the Holy Spirit.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Anserem gustare fas non patant.\"--CÆSAR, _Bell Gall._,\r\nlib. v. ch xii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: MILL'S _Hist. of the Crusades_, vol. i. ch. ii. p. 75.\r\nForster has suggested that it was a species of goose (which annually\r\nmigrates from the Black Sea towards the south) that fed the Israelites\r\nin the desert of Sinai, and that the \"winged fowls\" meant by the word\r\n_salu_, which has been heretofore translated \"quails,\" were \"red geese,\"\r\nresembling those of Egypt and India. He renders one of the mysterious\r\ninscriptions which abound in the Wady Mokatteb (_the Valley of\r\nWritings_), \"the red geese ascend from the sea,--lusting the people eat\r\nto repletion;\" thus presenting a striking concurrence with the passage\r\nin Numb. xi. 31, \"there went forth a wind from the Lord and brought\r\nquails (_salu_) from the sea.\"--FORSTER'S _One Primeval Language_, vol.\r\ni. p. 90.]\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the same word appears to designate the goose in\r\nthe most remote quarters of the globe. The Pali term \"_hanza_\" by which\r\nit was known to the Buddhists of Ceylon, is still the \"_henza_\" of the\r\nBurmese and the \"_gangsa_\" of the Malays, and is to be traced in the\r\n[Greek: \"chên\"] of the Greeks, the \"_anser_\" of the Romans, the\r\n\"_ganso_\" of the Portuguese, the \"_ansar_\" of the Spaniards, the\r\n\"_gans_\" of the Germans (who, PLINY says, called the white geese\r\n_ganza_), the \"_gas_\" of the Swedes, and the \"_gander_\" of the\r\nEnglish.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: HARDY observes that the ibis of the Nile is called\r\n\"_Abou-Hansa_\" by the Arabs, (_Buddhism_, ch. i. p. 17); but BRUCE\r\n(_Trav_. vol. v. p. 172) says the name is _Abou Hannes_ or _Father\r\nJohn_, and that the bird always appears on St. John's day: he implies,\r\nhowever, that this is probably a corruption of an ancient name now\r\nlost.]\r\n\r\nIn the principal apartment of the royal palace at Kandy, now the\r\nofficial residence of the chief civil officer in charge of the province,\r\nthe sacred bird occurs amongst the decorations, but in such shape as to\r\nresemble the dodo rather than the Brahmanee goose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE PALACE AT KANDY]\r\n\r\nIn the generality of the examples of ancient Singhalese carvings that\r\nhave come down to us, the characteristic which most strongly recommends\r\nthem, is their careful preservation of the outline and form of the\r\narticle decorated, notwithstanding the richness and profusion of the\r\nornaments applied. The subjects engraved are selected with so much\r\njudgment, that whilst elaborately covering the surface, they in no\r\ndegree mar the configuration. Even in later times this principle has\r\nbeen preserved, and the chasings in silver and tortoise shell on the\r\nscabbards of the swords of state, worn by the Kandyan kings and their\r\nattendants, are not surpassed by any specimens of similar workmanship in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n_Temples_.--The temples of Buddha were at first as unpretending as the\r\nresidences of the priesthood. No mention is made of them during the\r\ninfancy of Buddhism in Ceylon; at which period caves and natural\r\ngrottoes were the only places of devotion. In the sacred books these are\r\nspoken of as \"stone houses\"[1] to distinguish them from the \"houses of\r\nearth\"[2] and other materials used in the construction of the first\r\nbuildings for the worship of Buddha; such temples having been originally\r\nconfined to a single chamber of the humblest dimensions, within which it\r\nbecame the custom at a later period to place a statue of the divine\r\nteacher reclining in dim seclusion, the gloom being increased to\r\nheighten the scenic effect of the ever-burning lamps by which the\r\nchambers are imperfectly lighted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The King, Walagambahu, who in his exile had been living\r\namongst the rocks in the wilderness, ascended the throne after defeating\r\nthe Malabars (B.C. 104), and \"caused _the of stone or caves of the\r\nrocks_ in which he had taken refuge to be made more\r\ncommodious.\"--_Rajavali_, p. 224.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajavali_, p. 222.]\r\n\r\nThe construction of both these descriptions of temples was improved in\r\nlater times, but no examples remain of the ancient chaityas or built\r\ntemples in Ceylon, and those of the rock temples still existing exhibit\r\na very slight advance beyond the rudest attempts at excavation.\r\n\r\nOn examining the cave temples of continental India, they appear to\r\nexhibit three stages of progress,--first mere unadorned cells, like\r\nthose formed by Dasartha, the grandson of Asoca, in the granite rocks of\r\nBehar, about B.C. 200; next oblong apartments with a verandah in front,\r\nlike that of Ganesa, at Cuttack; and lastly, ample halls with colonnades\r\nseparating the nave from the aisles, and embellished externally with\r\nfaçades and agricultural decorations, such as the caves of Karli,\r\nAjunta, and Ellora.[1] But in Ceylon the earliest rock temples were\r\nmerely hollows beneath overhanging rocks, like those still existing at\r\nDambool, and the Aluwihara at Matelle, in both of which advantage has\r\nbeen taken of the accidental shelter of rounded boulders, and an\r\nentrance constructed by applying a façade of masonry, devoid of all\r\npretensions to ornament.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See FERGUSSON'S _Illustrations of the Rock-cut Temples of\r\nIndia_, Lond. 1845, and _Handbook of Architecture_, ch. ii. p. 23.]\r\n\r\nThe utmost effort at excavation never appears to have advanced beyond\r\nthe second stage attained in Bengal,--a small cell with a few columns to\r\nsupport a verandah in front; and even of this but very few examples now\r\nexist in Ceylon, the most favourable being the Gal-wihara at\r\nPollanarrua, which, according to the _Rajavali_, was executed by\r\nPrakrama I., in the 12th century.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxvii.]\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration the enthusiasm exhibited by the kings of\r\nCeylon, and the munificence displayed by them in the exaltation and\r\nextension of Buddhism, their failure to emulate the labours of its\r\npatrons in India, must be accounted for by the intractable nature of the\r\nrocks with which they had to contend, the gneiss and quartz of Ceylon\r\nbeing less favourable to such works than the sandstone of Cuttack, or\r\nthe trap formations of the western ghauts.\r\n\r\n_Oil-painting_.--In decorative art, carving and moulding in chunam were\r\nthe principal expedients resorted to. Of this substance were also formed\r\nthe \"beads resplendent like gems;\" the \"flower-ornaments\" resembling\r\ngold; and the \"festoons of pearls,\" that are more than once mentioned in\r\ndescribing the interiors of the palaces.[1] Externally, painting was\r\napplied to the dagobas alone, as in the climate of Ceylon, exposure to\r\nthe rains would have been fatal to the duration of the colours, if only\r\nmixed in tempera; but the Singhalese, at a very early period, were aware\r\nof the higher qualities possessed by some of the vegetable oils. The\r\nclaim of Van Eyck to the invention of oil-painting in the 15th century,\r\nhas been shown to be untenable. Sir Charles L. Eastlake[2] has adduced\r\nthe evidence of Ætius of Diarbekir, to prove that the use of oil in\r\nconnection with art[3] was known before the 6th century; and\r\nDioscorides, who wrote in the age of Augustus, has been hitherto\r\nregarded as the most ancient authority on the drying properties of\r\nwalnut, sesamum, and poppy. But the _Mahawanso_ affords evidence of an\r\nearlier knowledge, and records that in the 2nd century before Christ,\r\n\"vermilion paint mixed with tila oil,\"[4] was employed in the building\r\nof the Ruanwellé dagoba. This is, therefore, the earliest testimony\r\nextant of the use of oil as a medium for painting, and till a higher\r\nclaimant appears, the distinction of the discovery may be permitted to\r\nrest with the Singhalese.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxvii, p. 163.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: EASTLAKE'S _Materials for a History of Oil Painting_, ch.\r\ni. p. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Aetius [Greek: Biblion iatrikon.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Tila or tala is the Singhalese name for sesamum from which\r\nthe natives express the gingeli oil. SIR CHARLES L. EASTLAKE is of\r\nopinion that \"sesamum cannot be called a drying oil in the ordinary\r\nacceptation of the term,\" but in this passage of the _Mahawanso_, it is\r\nmentioned as being used as a cement. A question has been raised in\r\nfavour of the claim of the Egyptians to the use of oil in the decoration\r\nof their mummy cases, but the probability is that they were coloured in\r\ntempera and their permanency afterwards secured by a _varnish_.]\r\n\r\n_Style of Ornament_.--In decorating the temporary tee, which was placed\r\non the Ruanwellé dagoba, prior to its completion, the square base was\r\npainted with a design representing vases of flowers in the four panels,\r\nsurrounded by \"ornaments radiating like the five fingers.\"[1] This\r\ndescription points to the \"honeysuckle border,\" which, according to\r\nFergusson, was adopted and carried westward by the Greeks, and eastward\r\nby the Buddhist architects.[2] It appears upon the lat column at\r\nAllahabad, which is inscribed with one of the edicts of Asoca, issued in\r\nthe 3rd century before Christ.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxii. p. 193; ch. xxxviii. p. 258.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: FERGUSSON'S _Handbook of Architecture_, vol. i. ch. ii. p.\r\n7.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM THE CAPITAL OF A LAT]\r\n\r\nThe spire itself was \"painted with red stick-lac,\" probably the same\r\npreparation of vermilion as is used at the present day on the lacquered\r\nware of Burmah, Siam, and China.[1] Gaudy colours appear at all times to\r\nhave been popular; yellow, from its religious associations,\r\npre-eminently so[2]; and red lead was applied to the exterior of\r\ndagobas.[3] Bujas Raja, in the 4th century, painted the walls and roof\r\nof the Brazen Palace blue[4], and built a sacred edifice at\r\nAnarajapoora, which from the variety and brilliancy of the colours with\r\nwhich he ornamented the exterior, was known as the Monara Paw Periwena,\r\nor Temple of the Peacock.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A species of lacquer painting is practised with great\r\nsuccess at the present day in the Kandyan provinces, and especially at\r\nMatelle, the colours being mixed with a resinous exudation collected\r\nfrom a shrub called by the Singhalese Wæl-koep-petya (_Croton\r\nlacciferum_). The coloured varnish thus prepared is formed into films\r\nand threads chiefly by aid of the thumb-nail of the left hand, which is\r\nkept long and uncut for the purpose. It is then applied by heat and\r\npolished. It is chiefly employed in ornamenting the covers of books,\r\nwalking-sticks, the shafts of spears, and the handles of fans for the\r\npriesthood.

VIII.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITIES.--_Anarajapoora_.--Striking evidences of the state of\r\ncivilisation in Ceylon are furnished by the descriptions given, both by\r\nnative writers and by travellers, of its cities as they appeared prior\r\nto the 8th century of the Christian era. The municipal organisation of\r\nAnarajapoora, in the reign of Pandukábhaya, B.C. 437, may be gathered\r\nfrom the notices in the _Mahawanso_, of the \"_naggaraguttiko_,\" who was\r\nconservator of the city, of the \"guards stationed in the suburbs,\" and\r\nof the \"chandalas,\" who acted as scavengers and carriers of corpses. As\r\na cemetery was attached to the city, interment must have frequently\r\ntaken place, and the _nichi-chandalas_ are specially named as the\r\n\"cemetery men;\"[1] but the practice of cremation prevailed in the 2nd\r\ncentury before Christ, and the body of Elala was burned on the spot\r\nwhere he fell, B.C. 161.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. x. p. 65, 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid_., ch. xxv. p. 155.]\r\n\r\nThe capital at that time contained the temples of numerous religions,\r\nbesides public gardens, and baths; to which were afterwards added, halls\r\nfor dancing and music, ambulance halls, rest-houses for travellers[1],\r\nalms-houses[2], and hospitals[3]; in which animals, as well as men, were\r\ntenderly cared for. The \"corn of a thousand fields\" was appropriated by\r\none king for their use[4]; another set aside rice to feed the squirrels\r\nwhich frequented his garden[5]; and a third displayed his skill as a\r\nsurgeon, in treating the diseases of elephants, horses, and snakes.[6]\r\nThe streets contained shops and bazaars[7]; and on festive occasions,\r\nbarbers and dressers were stationed at each of the gates, for the\r\nconvenience of those resorting to the city.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: These rest-houses, like the Choultries of India, were\r\nconstructed by private liberality along all the leading highways and\r\nforest roads. \"Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of\r\nwayfaring men.\"--_Jer_. ix. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Rock inscription at Pollanarrua, A.D. 1187.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Rajaratnacari_, p. 39; _Mahawanso_, ch. x. p. 67; HARDY'S\r\n_Eastern Monachism_, p. 485.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxviii.

There are multitudes of men armed\r\nwith swords, and bows and arrows. Elephants, horses, carts, and myriads\r\nof people pass and repass, jugglers, dancers, and musicians of all\r\nnations, with chank shells and other instruments ornamented with gold.\r\nThe distance from the principal gate to the south gate, is four gows;\r\nand the same from the north to the south gate. The principal streets are\r\nMoon Street, Great King Street, Hinguruwak, and Mahawelli Streets,--the\r\nfirst containing eleven thousand houses, many of them two stories in\r\nheight. The smaller streets are innumerable. The palace has large ranges\r\nof buildings, some of them two and three stories high, and its\r\nsubterranean apartments are of great extent.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Eleven Years in Ceylon,_ vol. i. p. 235. But there is so\r\nclose a resemblance in each author to the description of the ancient\r\ncapital of the kings of Ayoudhya (Oude) that both seem to have been\r\ncopied from that portion of the Ramayana. See the passage quoted in Mrs.\r\nSpier's _Life in Ancient India,_ ch. iv. p. 99.]\r\n\r\nThe native descriptions of Anarajapoora, in the 7th century, are\r\ncorroborated by the testimony of the foreign travellers who visited it\r\nabout the same period. Fa Hian says, \"The city is the residence of many\r\nmagistrates, grandees, and foreign merchants; the mansions beautiful,\r\nthe public buildings richly adorned, the streets and highways straight\r\nand level, and houses for preaching built at every thoroughfare.\"[1] The\r\n_Leang-shu,_ a Chinese history of the Leang Dynasty, written between\r\nA.D. 507-509, describing the cities of Ceylon at that period, says, \"The\r\nhouses had upper stories, the walls were built of brick, and secured by\r\ndouble gates.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Foë-Kouë-k[)i],_ ch, xxxviii. p. 334.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Leang-shu,_ B, liv. p. 10.]\r\n\r\n_Carriages and Horses._--Carriages[1] and chariots[2] are repeatedly\r\nmentioned as being driven through the principal cities, and carts and\r\nwaggons were accustomed to traverse the interior of the country.[3] At\r\nthe same time, the frequent allusions to the clearing of roads through\r\nthe forests, on the approach of persons of distinction, serve to show\r\nthat the passage of wheel carriages must have been effected with\r\ndifficulty[4], along tracks prepared for the occasion, by freeing them\r\nof the jungle and brushwood. The horse is not a native of Ceylon, and\r\nthose spoken of by the ancient writers must have been imported from\r\nIndia and Arabia. White horses were especially prized, and those\r\nmentioned with peculiar praises were of the \"Sindhawo\" breed, a term\r\nwhich may either imply the place whence they were brought, or the\r\nswiftness of their speed.[5] In battle the soldiers rode chargers[6],\r\nand a passage in the _Mahawanso_ shows that they managed them by means\r\nof a rope passed through the nostril, which served as a bridle.[7]\r\nCosmas Indicopleustes, who considered the number of horses in Ceylon in\r\nthe 6th century to be a fact of sufficient importance to be recorded,\r\nadds that they were imported from Persia, and the merchants bringing\r\nthem were treated with special favour and encouragement, their ships\r\nbeing exempted from all dues and charges. Marco Polo found the export of\r\nhorses from Aden and Ormus to India going on with activity in the 13th\r\ncentury.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: B.C. 307, _Mahawanso_, ch. xiv. p. 80, 81; B.C. 204, Ib.,\r\nch. xxi. p. 128.

Chairs[1], raised seats[2],\r\nfootstools[3], and metal lamps[4], were articles comparatively unknown\r\nto the Hindus, and were obviously imitated by the Singhalese from the\r\nEast, from China, Siam, or Pegu.[5] The custom which prevails to the\r\npresent day of covering a chair with a white cloth, as an act of\r\ncourtesy in honour of a visitor, was observed with the same formalities\r\ntwo thousand years ago[6]. Rich beds[7] and woollen carpets[8] were in\r\nuse at the same early period, and ivory was largely employed in inlaying\r\nthe more sumptuous articles.[9] Coco-nut shells were used for cups and\r\nladles[10]; earthenware for jugs and drinking cups[11]; copper for\r\nwater-pots, oil-cans, and other utensils; and iron for razors, needles,\r\nand nail-cutters.[12] The _pingo_, formed of a lath cut from the stem of\r\nthe areca, or the young coco-nut palm, and still used as a yoke in\r\ncarrying burdens, existed at an early period[13], in the same form in\r\nwhich it is borne at the present day. It is identical with the _asilla_\r\nan instrument for the same purpose depicted on works of Grecian art[14]\r\nand on the monuments of Egypt.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xiv. p. 80; ch. xv. p. 84; _Rajaratnacari_\r\np. 134.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Ibid., ch. xiii. p. 82.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Ibid., xxvii. p. 164.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxx. p. 182; ch. xxxii. p. 192.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Asiatic Researches,_ vol. vi. p. 437.

In order to take a crop of\r\ndry grain, the soil being unequal to sustain continued cultivation, the\r\nsame king seeing that \"those who laboured with the bill-hook In clearing\r\nthorny jungles, earned their livelihood distressfully,\" ordained that\r\nthis _chena_ cultivation, as it is called, should be for ever exempted\r\nfrom taxation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Rock inscription at Pollanarrua, A.D. 1187.]\r\n\r\n_Army and Navy._--The military and naval forces of Ceylon were chiefly\r\ncomposed of foreigners. The genius of the native population was at all\r\ntimes averse to arms; from the earliest ages, the soldiers employed by\r\nthe crown were mercenaries, and to this peculiarity may be traced the\r\nfirst encouragement given to the invasion of the Malabars. These were\r\nemployed both on land and by sea In the third century before Christ[1];\r\nand it was not till the eleventh century of our era, that a marine was\r\norganised for the defence of the coast.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxi. p. 127.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid_., ch. xxxix.; TURNOUR'S MS. Transl. p. 269.]\r\n\r\nThe mode of raising a national force to make war against the invaders,\r\nis described in the _Mahawanso[1];_ the king issuing commands to ten\r\nwarriors to enlist each ten men, and each of this hundred in turn to\r\nenrol ten more, and each of the new levy, ten others, till \"the whole\r\ncompany embodied were eleven thousand one hundred and ten.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ibid_., ch. xxiii. p. 144.]\r\n\r\nThe troops usually consisted of four classes: the \"riders on elephants,\r\nthe cavalry, then those in chariots, and the foot soldiers,\"[1] and this\r\norganisation continued till the twelfth century.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajavali_, p. 208, The use of elephants in war is\r\nfrequently adverted to in the _Mahawamso_, ch. xxv. p. 151-155, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See the inscription on the tablet at Pollanarrua, A.D.\r\n1187.]\r\n\r\nTheir arms were \"the five weapons of war,\" swords, spears, javelins,\r\nbows, and arrows, and a rope with a noose, running in a metal ring\r\ncalled _narachana._[1] The archers were the main strength of the army,\r\nand their skill and dexterity are subjects of frequent eulogium.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch, vii 48; ch. xxv p. 155.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: One of the chiefs in the army of Dutugaimunu, B.C. 160, is\r\ndescribed as combining all the excellences of the craft, being at once a\r\n\"sound archer,\" who shot by ear, when his object was out of sight; \"a\r\nlightning archer,\" whose arrow was as rapid as a thunderbolt; and a\r\n\"sand-archer,\" who could send the shaft through a cart filled with sand\r\nand through hides \"an hundred-fold thick.\"--_Mahawanso,_ ch. xxiii. p.\r\n143. In one of the legends connected with the early life of Gotama,\r\nbefore he attained the exaltation of Buddhahood, he is represented as\r\ndisplaying his strength by taking \"a bow which required a thousand men\r\nto bend it, and placing it against the toe of his right foot without\r\nstanding up, he drew the string with his finger-nail.\"--HARDY'S _Manual\r\nof Buddhism,_ ch. vii. p. 153. It is remarkable that at the present day\r\nthis is the attitude assumed by a Veddah, when anxious to send an arrow\r\nwith more than ordinary force. The following sketch is from a model in\r\nebony executed by a native carver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEDDAH DRAWING HIS BOW]\r\n\r\nI am not aware that examples of this mode of drawing the bow are to be\r\nfound on any ancient monument, Egyptian, Assyrian, Grecian, or Roman;\r\nbut that it was regarded as peculiar to the inhabitants of India is\r\nshown by the fact that ARRIAN describes it as something remarkable in\r\nthe Indians in the age of Alexander. \"[Greek: Hoplisios de tês Indôn ouk\r\nhôutos eis tropos, all oi men pezoi autoisi toxon te echousin, isomêkes\r\ntps phoreonti to toxon, kai touto katô epi tên gên thentes kai tps podi\r\ntps aristerps antibantes, outôs ektoxeuousi, tên neurên epi mega opisô\r\napagagontes.\"--ARRIAN, _Indica_, lib, xvi. Arrian adds that such was the\r\nforce with which their arrows travelled that no substance was strong\r\nenough to resist them, neither shield, breast-plate, nor armour, all of\r\nwhich they penetrated. In the account of Brazil, by Kidder and Fletcher,\r\nPhilad. 1850, p. 558, the Indians of the Amazon are said to draw the bow\r\nwith the foot, and a figure is given of a Caboclo archer in the\r\nattitude; but, unlike the Veddah of Ceylon, the American uses both\r\nfeet.]\r\n\r\nThe _Rajaratnacari_ states that the arrows of the Malabars were\r\nsometimes \"drenched with the poison of serpents,\" to render recovery\r\nimpossible.[1] Against such weapons the Singhalese carried shields, some\r\nof them covered with plates of the chank shell[2]; this shell was also\r\nsounded in lieu of a trumpet[3], and the disgrace of retreat is implied\r\nby the expression that it ill becomes a soldier to \"_allow his hair to\r\nfly behind_.\"[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Rajaratnacari_, p. 101.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajavali_, p. 217.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxv. p. 154.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Rajavali_, p. 213.]\r\n\r\n_Civil Justice_.--Civil justice was entrusted to provincial judges[1];\r\nbut the King Kirti Nissanga, in the great tablet inscribed with his\r\nexploits, which still exists at Pollanarrua, has recorded that under the\r\nbelief that \"robbers commit their crimes through hunger for wealth, he\r\ngave them whatever riches they required, thus relieving the country from\r\nthe alarm of their depredations.\"[2] Torture was originally recognised\r\nas a stage in the administration of the law, and in the original\r\norganisation of the capital in the fourth century before Christ, a place\r\nfor its infliction was established adjoining the place of execution and\r\nthe cemetery.[3] It was abolished in the third century by King\r\nWairatissa; but the frightful punishments of impaling and crushing by\r\nelephants continued to the latest period of the Ceylon monarchy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Inscriptions on the Great Tablet at Pollanarrua.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. x. p.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.

Pandukabhaya, who was\r\nafterwards king, was \"educated in every accomplishment by Pandulo, a\r\nBrahman, who taught him along with his own son.\"[1] The Buddhist priests\r\nbecame afterwards the national instructors, and a passage in the\r\n_Rajavali_ seems to imply that writing was regarded as one of the\r\ndistinctive accomplishments of the priesthood, not often possessed by\r\nthe laity, as it mentions that the brother of the king of Kalany, in the\r\nsecond century before Christ, had been taught to write by a tirunansi,\r\n\"and made such progress that he could write as well as the tirunansi\r\nhimself.\"[2] The story in the _Rajavali_ of an intrigue which was\r\ndiscovered by \"the sound of the fall of a letter,\" shows that the\r\nmaterial then in use in the second century before Christ, was the same\r\nas at the present day, the prepared leaf of a palm tree.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. x. p. 60.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajavali_, p. 189.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nThe most popular sovereigns were likewise the most sedulous patrons of\r\nlearning. Prakrama I. founded schools at Pollanarrua[1]; and it is\r\nmentioned with due praise in the _Rajaratnacari_, that the King Wijayo\r\nBahu III., who reigned at Dambeadinia, A.D. 1240, \"established a school\r\nin every village, and charged the priests who superintended them to take\r\nnothing from the pupils, promising that he himself would reward them for\r\ntheir trouble.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxii. UPHAM'S version, vol. i. p. 274.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajaratnacari_, p. 99.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the propagators of a religion whose leading characteristics are\r\nits subtlety and thin abstractions, it may naturally be inferred that\r\nargument and casuistry held prominent place in the curriculum of\r\ninstruction. In the story of Mahindo, and the conversion of the island\r\nto Buddhism, the following display of logical acumen is ostentatiously\r\nparaded as evidence of the highly cultivated intellect of the neophyte\r\nking.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xiv. p. 79.]\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of ascertaining the capacity of the gifted monarch,\r\nMahindo thus interrogated him:--\r\n\r\n\"O king; what is this tree called?\r\n\r\n\"The Ambo.\r\n\r\n\"Besides this one, is there any other Ambo-tree?\r\n\r\n\"There are many.\r\n\r\n\"Besides this Ambo, and those other Ambo-trees, are there any other\r\ntrees on the earth?\r\n\r\n\"Lord; there are many trees, but they are not Ambo-trees.\r\n\r\n\"Besides the other Ambo-trees, and the trees that are not Ambo, is there\r\nany other?\r\n\r\n\"Gracious Lord, _this Ambo-tree._\r\n\r\n\"Ruler of men, thou art wise!\r\n\r\n\"Hast thou any relations, oh, king?\r\n\r\n\"Lord, I have many.\r\n\r\n\"King, are there any persons not thy relations?\r\n\r\n\"There are many who are not my relations.\r\n\r\n\"Besides thy relations, and those who are not thy relations, is there,\r\nor is there not, any other human being in existence?\r\n\r\n\"Lord, _there is myself._\r\n\r\n\"Ruler of men, Sadhu! thou art wise.\"\r\n\r\nThe course of education suitable for a prince in the thirteenth century\r\nincluded what was technically termed the eighteen sciences: \"1. oratory,\r\n2. general knowledge, 3. grammar, 4. poetry, 5. languages, 6. astronomy,\r\n7. the art of giving counsel, 8. the means of attaining _nirwana_[1], 9.\r\nthe discrimination of good and evil, 10. shooting with the bow, 11.\r\nmanagement of the elephant, 12. penetration of thoughts, 13. discernment\r\nof invisible beings, 14. etymology, 15. history, 16. law, 17. rhetoric,\r\n18. physic.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Nirwana\" is the state of suspended sensation, which\r\nconstitutes the eternal bliss of the Buddhist in a future state.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajaratnacari_ p. 100.]\r\n\r\n_Astronomy_.--Although the Singhalese derived from the Hindus their\r\nacquaintance, such as it was, with the heavenly bodies and their\r\nmovements, together with their method of taking observations, and\r\ncalculating eclipses[1], yet in this list the term \"astrology\" would\r\ndescribe better than \"astronomy\" the science practically cultivated in\r\nCeylon, which then, as now, had its professors in every village to\r\nconstruct horoscopes, and cast the nativities of the peasantry.\r\nDutugaimunu, in the second century before Christ, after his victory over\r\nElala, commended himself to his new subjects by his fatherly care in\r\nproviding \"a doctor, an astronomer, and a priest, for each group of\r\nsixteen villages throughout the kingdom;\"[2] and he availed himself of\r\nthe services of the astrologer to name the proper day of the moon on\r\nwhich to lay the foundation of his great religious structures.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A summary of the knowledge possessed by the early Hindus of\r\n_astronomy_ and _mathematical science_ will be found in MOUNTSTUART\r\nELPHINSTONE'S _History of India during the Hindu and Mahomedan Periods_,\r\nbook iii. ch. i. p. 127.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajaratnacari_ p. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxix. p. 169-173.]\r\n\r\nKing Bujas Raja, A.D. 339, increased his claim to popular acknowledgment\r\nby adding \"an astrologer, a devil-dancer, and a preacher.\"[1] At the\r\npresent day the astronomical treatises possessed by the Singhalese are,\r\ngenerally speaking, borrowed, but with considerable variation, from the\r\nSanskrit.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, p. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: HARDY'S _Buddhism_, ch. i. p. 22.]\r\n\r\n_Medicine_.--Another branch of royal education was medicine. The\r\nSinghalese, from their intercourse with the Hindus, had ample\r\nopportunities for acquiring a knowledge of this art, which was practised\r\nin India before it was known either in Persia or Arabia; and there is\r\nreason to believe that the distinction of having been the discoverers of\r\nchemistry which has been so long awarded to the Arabs, might with\r\ngreater justice have been claimed for the Hindus. In point of antiquity\r\nthe works of Charak and Susruta on Surgery and Materia Medica, belong to\r\na period long anterior to Greber, and the earliest writers of Arabia;\r\nand served as authorities both for them and the Mediæval Greeks.[1] Such\r\nwas their celebrity that two Hindu physicians, Manek and Saleh, lived at\r\nBagdad in the eighth century, at the court of Haroun al Raschid.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Dr. ROYLE'S _Essay on the Antiquity of Hindu Medicine_,\r\np. 64.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Professor Dietz, quoted by Dr. ROYLE.]\r\n\r\nOne of the edicts of Asoca engraved on the second tablet at Girnar,\r\nrelates to the establishment of a system of medical administration\r\nthroughout his dominions, \"as well as in the parts occupied by the\r\nfaithful race as far as Tambaparni (Ceylon), both medical aid for men,\r\nand medical aid for animals, together with medicaments of all sorts,\r\nsuitable for animals and men.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Journal Asiat. Soc. Bengal_, vol. vii. part. i. p. 159.]\r\n\r\nThese injunctions of the Buddhist sovereign of Magadha were religiously\r\nobserved by many of the Ceylon kings. In the \"register of deeds of\r\npiety\" in which Dutugaimunu, in the second century before Christ, caused\r\nto be enrolled the numerous proofs of his devotion to the welfare of his\r\nsubjects, it was recorded that the king had \"maintained at eighteen\r\ndifferent places, hospitals provided with suitable diet and medicines\r\nprepared by medical practitioners for the infirm.\"[1] In the second\r\ncentury of the Christian era, a physician and a surgeon were borne on\r\nthe establishments of the great monasteries[2], and even some of the\r\nsovereigns acquired renown by the study and practice of physic. On Bujas\r\nRaja, who became king of Ceylon, A.D. 339, the _Mahawanso_ pronounces\r\nthe eulogium, that he \"patronised the virtuous, discountenanced the\r\nwicked, rendered the indigent happy, and comforted the diseased by\r\nproviding medical relief.\"[3] He was the author of a work on Surgery,\r\nwhich is still held in repute by his countrymen; he built hospitals for\r\nthe sick and asylums for the maimed, and the benefit of his science and\r\nskill was not confined to his subjects alone, but was equally extended\r\nto the relief of the lower animals, elephants, horses, and other\r\nsuffering creatures.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxii. p. 196.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Rock inscription at Mihintala, A.D. 262.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxvii. p. 242-245.]\r\n\r\n_Botany._--The fact that the basis of their _Materia Medica_ has been\r\nchiefly derived from the vegetable kingdom, coupled with the\r\ncircumstance that their clothing and food were both drawn from the same\r\nsource, may have served to give to the Singhalese an early and intimate\r\nknowledge of plants. It was at one time believed that they were likewise\r\npossessed of a complete and general botanical arrangement; but MOON,\r\nwhose attention was closely directed to this subject, failed to discover\r\nany trace of a system; and came to the conclusion that, although well\r\naware of the various parts of a flower, and their apparent uses, they\r\nhave never applied that knowledge to a distribution of plants by classes\r\nor orders.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: MOON'S _Catalogue of Indigenous and Exotic Plants growing\r\nin Ceylon._ 4to. Colombo, 1824, p. 2.]\r\n\r\n_Geometry._--The invention of geometry has been ascribed to the\r\nEgyptians, who were annually obliged to ascertain the extent to which\r\ntheir lands had been affected by the inundations of the Nile, and to\r\nrenew the obliterated boundaries. A similar necessity led to like\r\nproficiency amongst the people of India and Ceylon, the minute\r\nsubdivision of whose lands under their system of irrigation necessitated\r\nfrequent calculations for the definition of limits and the division of\r\nthe crops.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The \"_Suriya Sidhanta,_\" generally assigned to the fifth or\r\nsixth century, contains a system of Hindu trigonometry, which not only\r\ngoes beyond anything known to the Greeks, but involves theorems that\r\nwere not discovered in Europe till the sixteenth century.--MOUNT-STUART\r\nELPHINSTONE'S _India,_ b. iii. ch. i. p. 129.]\r\n\r\n_Lightning Conductors._--In connection with physical science, a curious\r\npassage occurs in the _Mahawanso_ which gives rise to a conjecture that\r\nearly in the third century after Christ, the Singhalese had some dim\r\nidea of the electrical nature of lightning, and a belief, however\r\nerroneous, of the possibility of protecting their buildings by means of\r\nconductors.\r\n\r\nThe notices contained in THEOPHRASTUS and PLINY show that the Greeks and\r\nthe Romans were aware of the quality of attraction exhibited by amber\r\nand tourmaline.[1] The Etruscans, according to the early annalists of\r\nBorne, possessed the power of invoking and compelling thunder storms.[2]\r\nNuma Pompilius would appear to have anticipated Franklin by drawing\r\nlightning from the clouds; and Tullus Hostilius, his successor, was\r\nkilled by an explosion, whilst attempting unskilfully the same\r\nexperiment.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The electrical substances \"lyncurium\" and \"theamedes\" have\r\neach been conjectured to be the \"tourmaline\" which, is found in Ceylon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"Vel cogi fulmina vel impetrari.\" --PLINY, _Nat. Hist._\r\nlib. ii. ch. lii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Ibid_. There is an interesting paper on the subject of the\r\nknowledge of electricity possessed by the ancients, by Dr. FALCONER in\r\nthe _Memoirs of the Manchester Philosophical Society,_ A.D. 1788, vol.\r\niii. p. 279.]\r\n\r\nCTESIAS, a contemporary of Xenophon, spent much of his life in Persia,\r\nand says that he twice saw the king demonstrate the efficacy of an iron\r\nsword planted in the ground in dispersing clouds, hail, and\r\nlightning[1]; and the knowledge of conduction is implied by an\r\nexpression of LUCAN, who makes Aruns, the Etrurian flamen, concentrate\r\nthe flashes of lightning and direct them beneath the surface of the\r\nearth:--\r\n\r\n  \"dispersos fulminus ignes\r\n  Colligit, et terræ mæsto cum murmure cendit.\"\r\n  _Phars_. lib. i. v. 606.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: PHOTIUS, who has preserved the fragment (_Bibl._ lxxii.),\r\nafter quoting the story of CTESIAS as to the iron it question being\r\nfound in a mysterious Indian lake, adds, regarding the sword, [Greek:\r\n\"phêsi oe peri autou hoti pêgnimenos en tê gê nephous kai chalazês kai\r\nprêstêrôn estin apotropaios. Kai idein auton tauta phêsi Basileôs dis\r\npoiêsantos.\"] See BAEHR'S _C'tesiæ Reliquiæ,_ &c., p. 248, 271.]\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely an indication in any work that has come down to us\r\nfrom the first to the fifteenth century, that the knowledge of such\r\nphenomena survived in the western world; but the books of the Singhalese\r\ncontain allusions which demonstrate that in the _third_ and in the\r\n_fifth_ century it was the practice in Ceylon to apply mechanical\r\ndevices with the hope of securing edifices from lightning.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of these passages occurs in connection with the\r\nfollowing subject. It will be remembered that Dutugaimunu, by whom the\r\ngreat dagoba, known as the Ruanwellé, was built at Anarajapoora, died\r\nduring the progress of the work, B.C. 137, the completion of which he\r\nentrusted to his brother and successor Saidaitissa.[1] The latest act of\r\nthe dying king was to form \"the square capital on which the spire was\r\nafterwards to be placed[2], and on each side of this there was a\r\nrepresentation of the sun.\"[3] The _Mahawanso_ states briefly, that in\r\nobedience to his brother's wishes, Saidaitissa \"completed the\r\npinnacle,\"[4] for which the square capital before alluded to served as a\r\nbase; but the _Dipawanso_, a chronicle older than the _Mahawanso_ by a\r\ncentury and a half, gives a minute account of this stage of the work,\r\nand says that this pinnacle, which he erected between the years 137 and\r\n119 before Christ, was formed _of glass_.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxii. p. 198. See _ante_, Vol. I. Pt.\r\nIII. ch. v. p. 358.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid._, ch. xxxi. p. 192.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Ibid._, ch. xxxii. p. 193.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Ibid._, ch. xxxiii. p. 200.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: \"Karàpesi _khara-pindun_ mahá thupè varuttame.\" For this\r\nreference to the _Dipawano_ I am indebted to Mr. DE ALWIS of Colombo.]\r\n\r\nA subsequent king, Amanda, A.D. 20, fixed a chatta (in imitation of the\r\nwhite umbrella which is emblematic of royalty) on the spire[1], and two\r\ncenturies later, Sanghatissa, who reigned A.D. 234 to 246, \"caused this\r\nchatta to be gilt, and set four gems in the centre of the four emblems\r\nof the sun, each of which cost a lac.\"[2] And now follows the passage\r\nwhich is interesting from its reference, however obscure, to the\r\nelectrical nature of lightning. The _Mahawanso_ continues: \"he in like\r\nmanner placed a glass pinnacle on the spire _to serve as a protection\r\nagainst lightning_.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxv. p. 215.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid._, ch. xxxvi. p. 229.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Ibid._, ch. xxxvi. p. 229. This belief in the power of\r\naverting lightning by mechanical means, prevailed on the continent of\r\nIndia as well as in Ceylon, and one of the early Bengalese histories of\r\nthe temple of Juggernauth, written between the years A.D. 470 and A.D.\r\n520, says that when the building was completed, \"a _neclchukro_ was\r\nplaced at the top of the temple to prevent the falling of thunderbolts.\"\r\nIn an account of the modern temple which replaced this ancient\r\nstructure, it is stated that \"it bore a loadstone at the top, which, as\r\nit drew vessels to land, was seized and carried off two centuries ago by\r\nsailors.\"--_Asiat. Res._ vol. xv. p. 327.]\r\n\r\nThe term \"wajira-chumbatan\" in the original Pali, which TURNOUR has here\r\nrendered \"a glass pinnacle,\" ought to be translated \"a diamond hoop,\"\r\nboth in this passage and also in another in the same book in which it\r\noccurs.[1] The form assumed by the upper portion of the dagoba would\r\ntherefore resemble the annexed sketch.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In describing the events in the reign of Dhaatu-Sena, the\r\nking at whose instance and during whose reign the _Mahawanso_ was written\r\nby his uncle Mahanamo, between the years A.D. 459, 477, the author, who\r\nwas contemporary with the occurrence he relates, says, that \"at the\r\nthree principal chetyos (dagobas) he made a golden chatta and a diamond\r\nhoop (_wajira-chumbaton_) for each.\"--_Mahawanso_, ch. xxxviii. p. 259.\r\nSimilar instances of gems being attached to the chattas of dagobas are\r\nrecorded in the same work, ch. xlii. and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe original passage relative to the diamond hoop placed by Sanghatissa\r\nruns thus in Pali, \"Wisun satasahassagghé chaturócha mahamanin majjhé\r\nchatunnan suriyánán thapápési mahipati; _thupassa muddhani tatha anagghá\r\nwajira-chumbatan_,\" which Mr. DE ALWIS translates: \"The king caused to\r\nbe set four gems, each of the value of a lac, in the centre of the four\r\nemblems of the sun, _and likewise an invaluable adamantine_ (or diamond)\r\n_ring on the top of the thupa._\" Some difficulty existed in TURNOUR'S\r\nmind as to the rendering to be given to these two last words\r\n\"_wajira-chumbatan_.\" Prof. H.H. WILSON, to whom I have submitted the\r\nsentence, says, \"_Wajira_ is either 'diamond,' or 'adamant,' or 'the\r\nthunderbolt of Indra;'\" and with him the most leaned Pali scholars in\r\nCeylon entirely concur; De Saram, the Maha-Moodliar of the Governor's\r\nGate, the Rev. Mr. Gogerly, Mr. De Alwis, Pepole the Hight Priest of the\r\nAsgiria (who was TURNOUR'S instructor in Pali), Wattegamine Unnanse of\r\nKandy, Bulletgamone Unnanse of Galle, Batuwantudawe, of Colombo, and De\r\nSoyza, the translator Moodliar to the Colonial Secretary's Office. Mr.\r\nDE ALWIS says, \"The epithet _anagghan_, 'invaluable' or 'priceless,'\r\nimmediately preceding and qualifying _wajira_ in the original (but\r\nomitted by Turnour in the translation), shows that a substance far more\r\nvaluable than glass must have been meant.\" \"_Chumbatan_,\" Prof. Wilson\r\nsupposed to be the Pali equivalent to the Sanskrit _chumbakam_, \"the\r\nkisser or attractor of steel;\" the question he says is whether _wajira_\r\nis to be considered an adjective or part of a compound substantive,\r\nwhether the phrase is a _diamond-magnet pinnacle_, or _conductor_, or a\r\n_conductor_ or _attractor of the thunderbolt_. In the latter case it\r\nwould intimate that the Singhalese had a notion of lightning conductors,\r\nMr. DE ALWIS, however, and Mr. GOGERLY agree that chumba_ka_ is the same\r\nboth in Sanskrit and Pali, whilst chumba_ta_ is a Pali compound, which\r\nmeans a _circular prop_ or _support, a ring_ on which something rests,\r\nor _a roll of cloth_ formed into a circle to form a stand for a vessel;\r\nso that the term must be construed to mean _a diamond_ circlet, and the\r\npassage, transposing the order of the words, will read literally thus:\r\n\r\n  thapapesi      tatha   muddhani      thupassa\r\n  he placed in like manner on the top of the thupo\r\n\r\n  anagghan   wajira-chumbatan.\r\n  a valuable diamond    hoop.\r\n\r\nTURNOUR wrote his translation whilst residing at Kandy and with the aid\r\nof the priests, who being ignorant of English could only assist him to\r\nSinghalese equivalents for Pali words. Hence he was probably led into\r\nthe mistake of confounding _wajira_, which signifies \"diamond,\" or an\r\ninstrument for cutting diamonds, with the modern word _widura_, which\r\nbears the same import but is colloquially used by the Kandyans for\r\n\"glass.\" However, as glass as well as the diamond is an insulator of\r\nelectricity, the force of the passage would be in no degree altered\r\nwhichever of the two substances was really particularised. TURNOUR was\r\nequally uncertain as to the meaning of _chumbatan_, which in one\r\ninstance he has translated a \"pinnacle\" and in the other he has left\r\nwithout any English equivalent, simply calling \"wajira-chumbatan\" a\r\n\"chumbatan of glass.\"--_Mahawanso_, ch. xxxviii. p. 259.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A. Crown of the Dagoba.\r\n  B. The capital, with the sun on each of the four sides.\r\n  C. The spire.\r\n  D. The umbrella or chatta, gilt and surrounded\r\n     by \"chumbatan,\" a diamond circlet.]\r\n\r\nThe chief interest of the story centres in the words \"_to serve as a\r\nprotection against lightning_,\" which do not belong to the metrical text\r\nof the _Mahawanso_, but are taken from the explanatory notes appended to\r\nit. I have stated elsewhere, that it was the practice of authors who\r\nwrote in Pali verse, to attach to the text a commentary in prose, in\r\norder to illustrate the obscurities incident to the obligations of\r\nrhythm. In this instance, the historian, who was the kinsman and\r\nintimate friend of the king, by whose order the glass pinnacle was\r\nraised in the fifth century, probably felt that the stanza descriptive\r\nof the placing of the first of those costly instruments in the reign of\r\nSanghatissa, required some elucidation, and therefore inserted a passage\r\nin the \"tika,\" by which his poem was accompanied, to explain that the\r\nmotive of its erection was \"_for the purpose of averting the dangers of\r\nlightning_.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The explanatory sentence in the \"tika\" is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Thupassa muddhani tathá naggha wajira-chumbatanti tathewa mahà thupassa\r\nmuddhani satasahasaggha nikan maha manincha patitha petwa ta--ahettà\r\nasani upaddawa widdhanse natthan adhara walayamewn katwa anaggha\r\nwajira-chumbatancha pujeseti atho.\"\r\n\r\nMr. DE SARAY and Mr. DE AIWIS concur in translating this passage as\r\nfollows, \"In like manner having placed a large gem, of a lac in value,\r\non the top of the great thupa, he fixed below it, _for the purpose of\r\ndestroying the dangers of lightning_, an invaluable diamond chumbatan,\r\nhaving made it like a supporting ring or circular rest.\" Words\r\nequivalent to those in _italics_, Mr. TURNOUR embodies in his\r\ntranslation, but placed them between brackets to denote that they wore a\r\nquotation.]\r\n\r\nThe two passages, taken in conjunction, leave no room for doubt that the\r\nobject in placing the diamond hoop on the dagoba, was _to turn aside the\r\nstroke of the thunderbolt_.\r\n\r\nBut the question still remains, whether, at that very early period, the\r\npeople of Ceylon had such a conception, however crude and erroneous, of\r\nthe nature of electricity, and the relative powers of conducting and\r\nnon-conducting bodies, as would induce them to place a mistaken reliance\r\nupon the contrivance described, as one calculated to ensure their\r\npersonal safety; or whether, as religious devotees, they presented it as\r\na costly offering to propitiate the mysterious power that controls the\r\nelements. The thing affixed was however so insignificant in value,\r\ncompared with the stupendous edifice to be protected, that the latter\r\nsupposition is scarcely tenable. The dagoba itself was an offering, on\r\nthe construction of which the wealth of a kingdom had been lavished;\r\nbesides which it enshrined the holiest of all conceivable\r\nobjects--portions of the deified body of Gotama Buddha himself; and if\r\nthese were not already secured, from the perils of lightning by their\r\nown sanctity, their safety could scarcely be enhanced by the addition of\r\na diamond hoop.\r\n\r\nThe conjecture is, therefore, forced on us, that the Singhalese, in that\r\nremote era, had observed some physical facts, or learned their existence\r\nfrom others, which suggested the idea that it might be practicable, by\r\nsome mechanical device, to ward off the danger of lightning. It is just\r\npossible that having ascertained that glass or precious stones acted as\r\ninsulators of electricity, it may have occurred to them that one or both\r\nmight be employed as preservative agents against lightning.\r\n\r\nModern science is enabled promptly to condemn this reasoning, and to\r\npronounce that the expedient, so far from averting, would fearfully add\r\nto, the peril. But in the infancy of all inquiries the observation of\r\neffects generally precedes the comprehension of causes, and whilst it is\r\nobvious that nothing attained by the Singhalese in the third century\r\nanticipated the great discoveries relative to the electric nature of\r\nlightning, which were not announced till the seventeenth or eighteenth,\r\nwe cannot but feel that the contrivance described in the _Mahawanso_ was\r\none likely to originate amongst an ill-informed people, who had\r\nwitnessed certain phenomena the causes of which they were unable to\r\ntrace, and from which they were incapable of deducing any accurate\r\nconclusions.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: I have been told that within a comparatively recent period\r\nit was customary in this country, from some motive not altogether\r\napparent, to surmount the lightning conductors of the Admiralty and some\r\nother Government buildings with, a _glass summit_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\nSINGHALESE LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe literature of the ancient Singhalese derived its character from the\r\nhierarchic ascendency, which was fostered by their government, and\r\nexerted a preponderant influence over the temperament of the people. The\r\nBuddhist priesthood were the depositories of all learning and the\r\ndispensers of all knowledge:--by the obligation of their order the study\r\nof the classical Pali[1] was rendered compulsory upon them[2], and the\r\nbooks which have come down to us show that they were at the same time\r\nfamiliar with Sanskrit. They were employed by royal command in compiling\r\nthe national annals[3], and kings at various periods not only encouraged\r\ntheir labours by endowments of lands[4], but conferred distinction on\r\nsuch pursuits by devoting their own attention to the cultivation of\r\npoetry[5], and the formation of libraries.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Pali_, which is the language of Buddist literature in\r\nSiam, Ava, as well as in Ceylon, is, according to Dr. MILL, \"no other\r\nthan the Magadha Pracrit, the classical form in ancient Behar of that\r\nvery peculiar modification of Sanscrit speech which enters as largely\r\ninto the drama of the Hindus, as did the Doric dialect into the Attic\r\ntragedy of Ancient Greece.\" In 1826 MM. BURNOUF and LASSEN published\r\ntheir learned \"_Essai sur le Pali_,\" but the most ample light was thrown\r\nupon its structure and history by the subsequent investigations of\r\nTURNOUR, who, in the introduction to his version of the _Mahawanso_, has\r\nembodied a disquisition on the antiquity of Pali as compared with\r\nSanskrit (p. xxii. &c.).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajaratnacari_, p, 106.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Ibid_., p. 43-74]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Ibid_., p. 113]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Rajavali_, p. 245; _Mahawanso_, ch. liv., lxxix.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Rajavali_, p. 244.]\r\n\r\nThe books of the Singhalese are formed to-day, as they have been for\r\nages past, of _olas_ or strips taken from the young leaves of the\r\nTalipat or the Palmyra palm, cut before they have acquired the dark\r\nshade and strong texture which belong to the full grown frond.[1] After\r\nundergoing a process (one stage of which consists in steeping them in\r\nhot water and sometimes in milk) to preserve their flexibility, they are\r\nsubmitted to pressure to render their surface uniformly smooth. They are\r\nthen cut into stripes of two or three inches in breadth, and from one to\r\nthree feet long. These are pierced with two holes, one near each end,\r\nthrough which a cord is passed, so as to secure them between two wooden\r\ncovers, lacquered and ornamented with coloured devices. The leaves thus\r\nstrung together and secured, form a book.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The leaves of the Palmyra, similarly prepared, are used for\r\nwritings of an ordinary kind, but the most valuable books are written on\r\nthe Talipat See _ante_, Vol. I. Pt I. ch. iii. p. 110.]\r\n\r\nOn these palm-leaves the custom is to write with an iron stile held\r\nnearly upright, and steadied by a nick cut to receive it in the\r\nthumb-nail of the left hand. The stile is sometimes richly ornamented,\r\nshaped like an arrow, and inlaid with gold, one blade of the feather\r\nserving as a knife to trim the leaf preparatory to writing. The case is\r\nsometimes made of carved ivory bound with hoops of filigreed silver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WRITING WITH A STILE.]\r\n\r\nThe furrow made by the pressure of the steel is rendered visible by the\r\napplication of charcoal ground with a fragrant oil[1], to the odour of\r\nwhich the natives ascribe the remarkable state of preservation in which\r\ntheir most sacred books are found, its aromatic properties securing the\r\nleaves from destruction by white ants and other insects.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For this purpose a resin is used, called _dumula_ by the\r\nnatives, who dig it up from beneath the surface of lands from which the\r\nforest has disappeared.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In Ceylon there are a few Buddhist books brought from\r\nBurmah, in which the text is inscribed on plates of silver. I have seen\r\nothers on leaves of ivory, and some belonging to the Dalada Wihara, at\r\nKandy, are engraved on gold. The earliest grants of lands, called\r\n_sannas_, were written on palm-leaves, but an inscription on a rock at\r\nDambool, which is of the date 1200 A.D., records that King Prakrama Bahu\r\nI. made it a rule that \"when permanent grants of land were to be made to\r\nthose who performed meritorious services, such behests should not be\r\nevanescent like lines drawn on water by being inscribed on leaves to be\r\ndestroyed by rats and white ants, but engraved on plates of copper, so\r\nas to endure to posterity.\"]\r\n\r\nThe wiharas and monasteries of the Buddhist priesthood are the only\r\ndepositaries in Ceylon of the national literature, and in these are to\r\nbe found quantities of ola books on an infinity of subjects, some of\r\nthem, especially those relating to religion and ecclesiastical history,\r\nbeing of the remotest antiquity.\r\n\r\nWorks of the latter class are chiefly written in Pali. Treatises on\r\nastronomy, mathematics, and physics are almost exclusively in Sanskrit,\r\nwhilst those on general literature, being comparatively recent, are\r\ncomposed in Elu, a dialect which differs from the colloquial Singhalese\r\nrather in style than in structure, having been liberally enriched by\r\nincorporation from Sanskrit and Pali.[1] But of the works which have\r\ncome down to us, ancient as well as modern, so great is the\r\npreponderance of those in Pali and Sanskrit, that the Singhalese can\r\nscarcely be said to possess a literature in their national dialect; and\r\nin the books they do possess, so utter is the dearth of invention or\r\noriginality, that almost all which are not either ballads or\r\ncompilations, are translations from one or other of the two learned\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: TURNOUR'S Introd. to the _Mahawanso_, p. xiii. A critical\r\naccount of the Elu will be found in an able and learned essay on the\r\nlanguage and literature of Ceylon by Mr. J. DE ALWIS, prefixed to his\r\nEnglish. translation of the _Sidath Sangara_, a grammar of Singhalese,\r\nwritten in the fourteenth century. Colombo, 1852. Introd. p. xxvii.\r\nxxxvii.]\r\n\r\nI. PALI.--Works in Pali are written, like those of Burmah and Siam, not\r\nin Nagari or any peculiar character, but in the vernacular alphabet. Of\r\nthese, as might naturally be expected, the vast majority are on subjects\r\nconnected with Buddhism, and next to them in point of number are\r\ngrammars and grammatical commentaries.\r\n\r\nThe original of the great Pali grammar of Kachchayano is now lost, but\r\nits principles survive in numerous treatises, and text-books written at\r\nsucceeding periods to replace it.[1] Such is the passion for\r\nversification, probably as an assistant to memory, that nearly every\r\nSinghalese work, ancient as well as modern, is composed in rhyme, and\r\neven the repulsive abstractions of Syntax have found an Alvarez and been\r\nenveloped in metrical disguise.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Rev. R. SPENCE HARDY, to whom I am indebted for much\r\nvaluable information on the subject of the literature current at the\r\npresent day in Ceylon, published a list in the _Journal of the Ceylon\r\nBranch of the Asiatic Society_ for 1848, in which he gave the titles of\r\n467 works in Pali, Sanskrit, and Elu, collected by himself during his\r\nresidence in Ceylon. Of these about 80 are in Sanskrit, 150 in Elu (or\r\nSinghalese), and the remainder in Pali, either with or without\r\ntranslations. Of the Pali book 26 are either grammars or treatises on\r\ngrammar.\r\n\r\nThis catalogue of Mr. Hardy is, however, by no means to be regarded as\r\nperfect; not only because several are omitted, but because many are but\r\nexcerpts from larger works. The titles are seldom descriptive of the\r\ncontents, but in true Oriental taste are drawn from emblems and figures,\r\nsuch as \"Light,\" \"Gems,\" and \"Flowers.\" The authors' names are rarely\r\nknown, and the language or style seldom affords an indication of the age\r\nof the composition.]\r\n\r\nOf the sacred writings in Pali, the most renowned are the\r\n_Pitakattayan_, literally \"The Three Baskets,\" which embody the\r\ndoctrines, discourses, and discipline of the Buddhists, and so\r\nvoluminous is this collection that its contents extend to 592,000\r\nstanzas; and the Atthakatha or commentaries, which are as old as the\r\nfifth century[1], contain 361,550 more. From their voluminousness, the\r\nPittakas are seldom to be seen complete, but there are few of the\r\nsuperior temples in which one or more of the separate books may not be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: They were translated into Pali from Singhalese by\r\nBuddhaghoso, A.D. 420.--_Mahawanso_, c. xxxvii, p. 252.]\r\n\r\nThe most popular portion of the Pittakas are the legendary tales, which\r\nprofess to have been related by GOTAMO BUDDHA himself, in his _Sutras_\r\nor discourses, and were collected under the title of\r\n_Pansiya-panas-jataka-pota_, or the \"Five hundred and fifty Births.\" The\r\nseries is designed to commemorate events in his own career, during the\r\nstates of existence through which he passed preparatory to his reception\r\nof the Buddhahood. In structure and contents it bears a striking\r\nresemblance to the Jewish Talmud, combining, with aphorisms and maxims,\r\nphilological explanations of the divine text, stories illustrative of\r\nits doctrines, into which not only saints and heroes, but also animals\r\nand inanimate objects, are introduced, and not a few of the fables that\r\npass as Æsop's are to be found in the Jatakas of Ceylon. There are\r\ntranslations into Singhalese of the greater part of its contents, and so\r\nattractive are its narratives that the natives will listen the livelong\r\nnight to recitations from its pages.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: HARDY'S _Buddhism_, ch. v. p. 98.]\r\n\r\nThe other Pali works[1] embrace subjects in connection with cosmography\r\nand the Buddhist theories of the universe; the distinctions of caste,\r\ntopographical narratives, a few disquisitions on medicine, and books\r\nwhich, like the Milindaprasna, or \"_Questions of Milinda_,\"[2] without\r\nbeing canonical give an orthodox summary of the national religion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A lucid account of the principal Pali works in connection\r\nwith religion will be found in the Appendix to HARDY'S _Manual of\r\nBuddhism_, p. 509, and in HARDY'S _Eastern Manichian_, pp. 27, 315.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The title of this popular work has given rise to a very\r\ncurious conjecture of Turnour's. It professes to contain the dialectic\r\ncontroversies of Nagannoa, through whose instrumentality Buddhism was\r\nintroduced into Kashmir, with Milinda, who was the Raja of an adjoining\r\ncountry, called Sagala, near the junction of the rivers Ravi and Chenab.\r\nThese dicussions must have taken place about the year B.C. 44. Now\r\nSagala is identical with Sangala, the people of which, according to\r\nArrian, made a bold resistance to the advance of Alexander the Great\r\nbeyond the Hydraotes; and it has been supposed by Sir Alexander Burnes\r\nto have occupied the site of Lahore. Its sovereign, therefore, who\r\nembraced the doctrines of Buddha, was probably an Asiatic Greek, and\r\nTURNOUR suggests that the \"Yons\" or \"Yonicas\" who, according to the\r\nMilinda-prasna, formed his body-guard, were either Greeks or the\r\ndescendants of Greeks from Ionia.--_Journ. Asiat. Soc. Beng._ v. 523;\r\nHARDY'S _Manual of Buddhism_, p. 512; REINAUD, _Mémoire sur l'Inde_, p.\r\n65.]\r\n\r\nBut the _chefs d'oeuvre_ of Pali literature are their chronicles, the\r\n_Dipawanso, Mahawanso,_ and others; of these the most important by far\r\nis the _Mahawanso_ and its tikas or commentaries. It stands at the head\r\nof the historical literature of the East; unrivalled by anything extant\r\nin Hindustan[1], the wildness of whose chronology it controls; and\r\nunsurpassed, if it be equalled, by the native annals of China or\r\nKashmir. So conscious were the Singhalese kings of the value of this\r\nnational monument, that its continuation was an object of royal\r\nsolicitude to successive dynasties[2] from the third to the thirteenth\r\ncentury; and even in the decay of the monarchy the compilation was\r\nperformed in A.D. 1696, by an unknown hand, and, finally, brought down\r\nto A.D. 1758 by order of one of the last of the Kandyan kings.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: LASSEN, _Indis. Alt_., vol. ii. p. 13-15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: COSMAS INDICO-PLEUSTES, EDRISI, ABOU-ZEYD, and almost all\r\nthe travellers and geographers of the middle ages, have related, as a\r\ntrait of the native rulers of Ceylon, their employment of annalists to\r\nrecord the history of the kingdom.--EDRISI, _Clim._ i. sec. 8, p. 3.]\r\n\r\nOf the chronicles thus carefully constructed, which exhibit in their\r\nmarvellously preserved leaves the study and elaboration of upwards of\r\ntwelve hundred years, PRINSEP, supreme as an authority, declared that\r\nthey served to \"clear away the chief of difficulties in Indian\r\ngenealogies, which seem to have been intentionally falsified by the\r\nBrahmans and thrown back into remote antiquity, in order to confound\r\ntheir Buddhist rivals.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: PRINSEP, in a private letter to Turnour, in 1836, speaking\r\nof the singular value of the _Mahawanso_ in collating the chronology of\r\nIndia, says, \"had your Buddhist chronicles been accessible to Sir W.\r\nJones and Wilford, they would have been greedily seized to correct\r\nanomalies at every step.\"]\r\n\r\nBut they display in their mysterious rhymes few facts or revelations to\r\nrepay the ordinary reader for the labour of their perusal. Written\r\nexclusively by the Buddhist priesthood, they present the meagre\r\ncharacteristics of the soulless system which it is their purpose to\r\nextol. No occurrence finds a record in their pages which does not tend\r\nto exalt the genius of Buddhism or commemorate the acts of its patrons:\r\nthe reigns of the monarchs who erected temples for its worship, or\r\nconsecrated shrines for its relics, are traced with tiresome precision;\r\neven where their accession was achieved by usurpation and murder, their\r\nlives are extolled for piety, provided they were characterised by\r\nliberality to the church; whilst those alone are stigmatised as impious\r\nand consigned to long continued torments, whose reigns are\r\nundistinguished by acts conducive to the exaltation of the national\r\nworship.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Asoca, \"who put to death one hundred brothers,\" to secure\r\nthe throne to himself, is described in the _Mahawanso_, ch. v. p. 21, as\r\na prince \"of piety and supernatural wisdom.\" Even Malabar infidels, who\r\nassassinated the Buddhist kings, are extolled as \"righteous sovereigns\"\r\n(_Mahawanso_, ch. xxi. p. 127); but a Buddhist king who caused a priest\r\nto be put to death who was believed to be guilty of a serious crime, is\r\nconsigned by the _Rajavali_ to a hell with a copper roof \"so hot that\r\nthe waters of the sea are dried as they roil above it.\"--_Rajavali_, p.\r\n192.]\r\n\r\nThe invasions which disturbed the tranquillity of the throne, and the\r\nschisms which rent the unity of the church, are described with painful\r\nelaboration; but we search in vain for any instructive notices of the\r\npeople or of their pursuits, for any details of their social condition\r\nor illustration of their intellectual progress. Whilst the commerce of\r\nall nations was sweeping along the shores of Ceylon, and the ships of\r\nChina and Arabia were making its ports their emporiums; the national\r\nchronicles, whose compilation was an object of solicitude to successive\r\ndynasties, are silent regarding these adventurous expeditions; and\r\nutterly indifferent to all that did not affect the progress of Buddhism\r\nor minister to the interests of the priesthood.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It has been surmised that in the intercourse which\r\nsubsisted between India and the western world by way of Alexandria and\r\nPersia, and which did not decline till the sixth or seventh century, the\r\ninfluences of Nestorian Christianity may have left their impress on the\r\ngenius and literature of Buddhism; and in the legends of its historians\r\none is struck by the many passages that suggest a similarity to events\r\nrecorded in the Jewish Scriptures. The coincidence may also be accounted\r\nfor by the close proximity of a Jewish race in Afghanistan (the\r\ndescendants of those carried away into captivity by Shalmanasar) which\r\neventually extended itself along the west coast of India, and became the\r\nprogenitors of the Hebrew colony that still inhabits the south of the\r\nDekkan near Cochin, and are known as the \"Black Jews of Malabar.\" The\r\ninfluence of this immigration is perceptible in the sacred books, both\r\nof the Brahmans and Buddhists; the laws of Menu present some striking\r\nresemblances to the law of Moses, and it was probably from a knowledge\r\nof the contents of the Hebrew rolls still possessed by this remnant of\r\nthe dispersion that the Buddhists borrowed the numerous incidents which\r\nwe find reproduced in the historical books of Ceylon. Thus the\r\naborigines, when subdued by their Bengal invaders, were forced, like the\r\nIsraelites, by their masters \"to make bricks\" for the construction of\r\ntheir stupendous edifices (_Mahawanso_, ch. xxviii.). On the occasion of\r\nbuilding the great dagoba, the Ruanwellé, at Anarajapoora, B.C. 161, the\r\nmaterials were all prepared at a distance, and brought ready to be\r\ndeposited in their places (_Mahawanso_, xxvii.); as on the occasion of\r\nbuilding the first temple at Jerusalem, \"the stone was made ready before\r\nit was brought, so that there was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool\r\nof iron heard whilst it was building.\" The parting of the Red Sea to\r\npermit the march of the fugitive Hebrews has its counterpart in the\r\nexploit of the King Gaja Bahu, A.D. 109, who, when marching his army to\r\nthe coast of India, in order to bring back the Singhalese from\r\ncaptivity in Sollee, \"smote the waters of the sea till they parted, so\r\nthat he and his army marched through without wetting the soles of their\r\nfeet.\"--_Rajaratnacari_, p. 59. King Maha Sen (A.D. 275), seeking a\r\nrelic, had the mantle of Buddha lowered down from heaven: and Buddha\r\nhad, previously, in designating Kasyapa as his successor, transmitted to\r\nhim his robe as Elijah let fall his mantle upon Elisha. (_Rajavali_, p.\r\n238; HARDY'S _Oriental Monachism_, p. 119.) There is a resemblance too\r\nbetween the apotheosis of Dutugaimunu and the translation of Elijah when\r\n\"in a chariot and horses of fire he went up into heaven\" (2 Kings, ii.\r\n11);--according to the _Mahawanso_, ch. xxii p. 199, when the Singhalese\r\nking was dying, a chariot was seen descending from the sky and his\r\ndisembodied spirit \"manifested itself standing in the car in which he\r\ndrove thrice round the great shrine, and then bowing down to the\r\nattendant priesthood, he departed for tusita\" (the Buddhists' heaven).\r\nThe ceremonial and dogmatic coincidences are equally\r\nremarkable;--constant allusion is made to the practice of the kings to\r\n\"wash the feet of the priests and anoint them with oil.\"--_Mahawanso_;\r\nch. xxv.--xxx. In conformity with the denunciation that the sins of the\r\nfathers were to be visited on the children, the Jews inquired whether a\r\n\"man's parents did commit sin that he was born blind?\" (John, ix. 3) and\r\nin like manner, in the _Rajavali_, \"the perjury of Wijayo (who had\r\nrepudiated his wife after swearing fidelity to her) was visited on the\r\nperson of the King Panduwaasa,\" his nephew, who was afflicted with\r\ninsanity in consequence _(Rajavali_, pp. 174-178). The account in the\r\n_Rajaratnacari_ of King Batiya Tissa (B.C. 20), who was enabled to enter\r\nthe Ruanwellé dagoba by the secret passage known only to the priests,\r\nand to discover their wealth and treasures deposited within, has a close\r\nresemblance to the descent of Daniel and King Astyages into the temple\r\nof Bel, by the privy entrance under the table, whereby the priests\r\nentered and consumed the offerings made to the idol (Bel and the Dragon,\r\nApocryp. ch. i.-xiii.; _Rajaratnacari_, p. 45). The inextinguishable\r\nfire which was for ever burning on the altar of God (Leviticus, ch. vi.\r\n13) resembles the lamps which burned for 5000 years continually in\r\nhonour of Buddha (_Mahawanso_, ch. lxxxi.; _Rajaratnacari_, p. 49); and\r\nthese again had their imitators in the lamp of Minerva, which was never\r\npermitted to go out in the temple at Athens, and in the [Greek: luchnon\r\nasbeston], which was for ever burning in the temple of Ammon. The\r\nmiracle of feeding the multitude by our Saviour upon a few loaves and\r\nfishes, is repeated in the _Mahawanso_, where a divinely endowed\r\nprincess fed Pandukabhaya, B.C. 437, and five hundred of his followers\r\nwith the repast which she was taking to her father and his reapers, the\r\nrefreshment being \"scarcely diminished in quantity as if one person only\r\nhad eaten therefrom.\"--_Mahawanso_, ch. x. p. 62. The preparation of the\r\nhigh road for the procession of the sacred bo-tree after its landing\r\n(_Mahawanso_, ch. xix. p. 116), and the order to clear a road through\r\nthe wilderness for the march of the king at the inauguration of\r\nBuddhism, recall the words of the prophet, \"Prepare ye the way of the\r\nLord, make straight a highway in the desert.\" (Isaiah, xl. 3.) And we\r\nare reminded of the prophecy of Isaiah as to the kingdom of peace, in\r\nwhich \"the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf with the\r\nlion, and a young child shall lead them,\" by the Singhalese historians,\r\nin describing the religious repose of the kingdom of Asoca under the\r\ninfluence of the religion of Buddha, where \"the elk and the wild hog\r\nwere the guardians of the gardens and fields, and the tiger led forth\r\nthe cattle to graze and reconducted them in safety to their\r\npens.\"--_Mahawanso_, ch. v. p. 22. The narrative of the \"judgment of\r\nSolomon,\" in the matter of the contested child (1 Kings, ch. iii.), has\r\nits parallel in a story in every respect similar in the\r\nPansyiapanas-jataka.--ROBERT'S _Orient. Illustr_. p. 101.]\r\n\r\nII. SANSKRIT.--In Sanskrit or translations from it, the Singhalese have\r\npreserved their principal treatises on physical science, cosmography,\r\nmateria medica, and surgery. From it, too, they have borrowed the\r\nlimited knowledge of astronomy, possessed by the individuals who\r\ncombined with astrology and the casting of nativities, the practice of\r\npalmistry and the interpretation of dreams. In Sanskrit, they have\r\ntreatises on music and painting, on versification and philology; and\r\ntheir translations include a Singhalese version of those portions of the\r\n_Ramayana_, which commemorate the conquest of Lanka.\r\n\r\nIII. ELU AND SINGHALESE.--There is no more striking evidence of the\r\nintellectual inferiority of the modern, as compared with the ancient\r\ninhabitants of Ceylon, than is afforded by the popular literature of the\r\nlatter, and the contrast it presents to the works of former ages.\r\nDescending from the gravity of religious disquisition and the dignity of\r\nhistory and science, the authors of later times have been content to\r\nlimit their efforts to works of fiction and amusement, and to ballads\r\nand doggerel descriptions of places or passing events.\r\n\r\nBut, to the credit of the Singhalese, it must be said, that in their\r\ncompositions, however satirical or familiar they may be, their verses\r\nare entirely free from the licentiousness which disfigures similar\r\nproductions in India; and that if deficient in imagination and grace,\r\nthey are equally exempt from grossness and indelicacy.\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese language is so flexible that it admits of every\r\ndescription of rhythm; of this the versifiers have availed themselves to\r\nexhibit every variety of stanza and measure, and every native, male or\r\nfemale, can recite numbers of their favourite ballads. Their graver\r\nproductions consist of poems in honour, not of Buddha alone, but of\r\ndeities taken from the Hindu Pantheon,--Patine, Siva, and Ganesa,\r\npanegyrics upon almsgiving, and couplets embodying aphorisms and morals.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of the Sutras or Discourses of Buddha have been\r\ntranslated into the vernacular from Pali, but the most popular of all\r\nare the _jatakas_, the Singhalese versions of which are so extended,\r\nthat one copy alone fills 2000 olas or palm leaves, each twenty-nine\r\ninches in length and containing nine lines in a page.\r\n\r\nThe other works in Singhalese are on subjects connected with history,\r\nsuch as the _Rajavali_ and _Rajaratnacai_, on grammar and lexicography,\r\non medicine, topography, and other analogous subjects. But in all their\r\nproductions, though invested with the trappings of verse, there alike is\r\nan avoidance of what is practical and true, and an absence of all that\r\nis inventive and poetic. They contain nothing that appeals to the heart\r\nor the affections, and their efforts of imagination aspire not to please\r\nor to elevate, but to astonish and bewilder by exaggeration and fable.\r\nTheir poverty of resources leads to endless repetitious of the same\r\nepithets and incidents; books are multiplied at the present day chiefly\r\nby extracts from works of established popularity, and the number of\r\nqualified writers is becoming annually less from the altered\r\ncircumstances of the island and the decline of those institutions and\r\nprospects which formerly stimulated the ambition of the Buddhist\r\npriesthood, and inspired a love of study and learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XI.\r\n\r\nBUDDHISM AND DEMON-WORSHIP.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to attempt any condensed, and at the same time\r\nperspicuous, sketch of the national religion of Ceylon--a difficulty\r\nwhich arises not merely from the voluminous obscurity of its sacred\r\nhistory and records; but still more from confusion in the variety of\r\nforms under which Buddhism exhibits itself in various localities, and\r\nthe divergences of opinion which prevail as to its tenets and belief.\r\nThe antiquity of its worship is so extreme, that doubts still hang over\r\nits origin and its chronological relations to the religion of Brahma.\r\nWhether it took its rise in Hindustan, or in countries farther to the\r\nWest, and whether Buddhism was the original doctrine of which Brahmanism\r\nbecame a corruption, or Brahmanism the original and Buddhism an effort\r\nto restore it to its pristine purity[2],--all these are questions which\r\nhave yet to be adjusted by the results of Oriental research.[3] It is,\r\nhowever, established by a concurrence of historical proofs, that many\r\ncenturies before the era of Christianity the doctrines of Buddha were\r\nenthusiastically cultivated in Baha, the _Magadha_, or country of the\r\nMagas, whose modern name is identified with the _Wiharas_ or monasteries\r\nof Buddhism. Thence its teachers diffused themselves extensively\r\nthroughout India and the countries to the eastward;--upwards of two\r\nthousand years ago it became the national religion of Ceylon and the\r\nIndian Archipelago; and its tenets have been adopted throughout the vast\r\nregions which extend from Siberia to Siam, and from the Bay of Bengal to\r\nthe western shores of the Pacific.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The details of the following chapter have been principally\r\ntaken from SIR J. EMERSON TENNENT'S _Christianity in Ceylon_, ch. v.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Those early writers on the religions of India who drew\r\ntheir information exclusively from Brahmanical sources, incline to\r\nfavour the pretensions of that system as the most ancient of the two.\r\nKlaproth, a profound authority, was of this opinion; but in later times\r\nthe translations of the Pali records and other sacred volumes of\r\nBuddhism in Western India, Ceylon, and Nepal, have inclined the\r\npreponderance of opinion, if not in favour of the superior antiquity of\r\nBuddhism, at least in support of its contemporaneous development. A\r\nsummary of the arguments in favour of the superior antiquity of Buddhism\r\nwill be found in the \"_Notes_,\" &c., by Colonel SYKES, in the 12th\r\nvolume of the _Asiatic Journal_--and in the _Essai sur l'Origine des\r\nPrincipaux Peuples Anciens_, par F.L.M. MAUPIED, chap. viii. The\r\narguments on the side of those who look on Brahmanism as the original,\r\nare given by MOUNTSTUART ELPHINSTONE in his _History of India_, vol. i.\r\nb. ii. c. 4. An able disquisition will be found in MAX MÜLLER's _History\r\nof Sanskrit Literature_, pp. 33, 260, &c. Mr. GOGERLY, the most\r\naccomplished student of Buddhism in Ceylon, says its sacred books\r\nexpressly demonstrate that its doctrines had been preached by the\r\ntwenty-four Buddhas who had lived prior to Gotama, in periods incredibly\r\nremote; but that they had entirely disappeared at the time of Gotama's\r\nbirth, so that he re-discovered the whole, and revived an extinguished\r\nor nearly extinct school of philosophy.--_Notes on Buddhism_ by the Rev.\r\nMr. GOGERLY, Appendix to LEE'S Translation of Ribeyro, p. 265.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The celebrated temple of Somnauth was originally a Buddhist\r\nfoundation, and in the worship of Jaggernath, to whose orgies all ranks\r\nare admitted without distinction of caste, there may still be traced an\r\ninfluence of Buddhism, if not a direct Buddhistical origin. Colonel\r\nSykes is of opinion that the sacred tooth of Buddha was at one time\r\ndeposited and worshipped in the great Temple of Calinga, now dedicated\r\nto Jaggernath, by the Princes of Orissa, who in the fourth century\r\nprofessed the Buddhist religion. (Colonel SYKES, _Notes_, &c., _Asiatic\r\nJournal_, vol. xii. pp. 275; 317, 420.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: FA HIAN declares that in the whole of India, including\r\nAffghanistan and Bokhara, he found in the fourth century a Buddhist\r\npeople and dynasty, with traditions of its endurance for the preceding\r\nthousand years. \"As to Hindostan itself, he says, from the time of\r\nleaving the deserts (of Jaysulmeer and Bikaneer) and the river (Jumna)\r\nto the west, _all the kings of the different kingdoms in India are\r\nfirmly attached to the law of Buddha_, and when they do honour to the\r\necclesiastics they take off their diadems.\"--See also MAUPIED, _Essai\r\nsur l'Origine des Principaux Peuples Anciens_, chap. ix. p. 209.]\r\n\r\nLooking to its influence at the present day over at least three hundred\r\nand fifty millions of human beings--exceeding one-third of the human\r\nrace--it is no exaggeration to say that the religion of Buddha is the\r\nmost widely diffused that now exists, or that has ever existed since the\r\ncreation of mankind.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See _ante_, p. 326. So ample are the materials offered by\r\nBuddhism for antiquarian research, that its doctrines have been sought\r\nto be identified at once with the Asiatic philosophy and with the myths\r\nof the Scandinavians. Buddha has been at one time conjectured to be the\r\nWoden of the Scythians; at another the prophet Daniel, whom\r\nNebuchadnezzar had created master of the astrologers, or chief priest of\r\nthe Magi, as the title is rendered in the Septuagint--[Greek: Archonta\r\nMagôi]. An antiquarian of Wales, in devising a pedigree for the Oymri,\r\nhas imported ancestors for the ancient Britons from Ceylon; and a writer\r\nin the _Asiatic Researches_, in 1807, as a preamble to the proof that\r\nthe binomial theorem was familiar to the Hindus, has traced Western\r\ncivilisation to an irruption of philosophers from India, identified the\r\nDruids with the Brahmans, and declared Stonehenge to be \"one of the\r\ntemples of Boodh.\" (_Asiat. Res_., vol. ii. p. 448.) A still more recent\r\ninvestigator, M. MAUPIED, has collected, in his _Essai sur l'Origine des\r\nPeoples Anciens_, what he considers to be the evidence that Buddhism may\r\nbe indebted for its appearance in India to the captivity of the Jews by\r\nSalmanasar, 729 B.C.; to their dispersion by Assar-Addon at a still more\r\nrecent period; to their captivity in Babylon, 606 B.C.: their diffusion\r\nover Media and the East, Persia, Bactria, Thibet, and China, and the\r\ncommunication of their sacred book to the nations amongst whom they thus\r\nbecame sojourners. He ventures even to suggest a possible identity\r\nbetween the names Jehovah and Buddha: \"Les voyelles du mot Buddha sont\r\nles mêmes que celles du mot Jéhovah, qu'on prononce aussi _Jouva_; mais\r\nd'ailleurs le nom de Boudda a bien pu être tiré du mot _Jeoudda_ Juda,\r\nle dieu de Joudda _Boudda_.\"--Chap. ix. p. 235. To account for the purer\r\nmorals of Buddhism, MAUPIED has recourse to the conjecture that they may\r\nhave been influenced by the preaching of St. Thomas at Ceylon, and\r\nBartholomew on the continent of India. \"_Or il nous semble logique de\r\nconclure de teus ces faits que le Bouddhisme, dans ses doctrines\r\nessentielles, est d'origine Juire et Chrétienne; conséquence inattendue\r\npour la plus de nos lecteurs sans doute_.\"--MAUPIED, ch. ix. p. 257; ch.\r\nx. p. 263.]\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest period of Indian tradition, the struggle between the\r\nreligion of Buddha and that of Brahma was carried on with a fanaticism\r\nand perseverance which resulted in the ascendancy of the Brahmans,\r\nperhaps about the commencement of the Christian era, and the eventual\r\nexpulsion some centuries later of the worship of their rivals from\r\nHindustan; but at what precise time the latter catastrophe was\r\nconsummated has not been recorded in the annals of either sect.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The final overthrow of Buddhism in Bahar and its expulsion\r\nfrom Hindustan took place probably between the seventh and twelfth\r\ncenturies of the Christian era. Colonel SYKES, however, extends the\r\nperiod to the thirteenth or fourteenth (_Asiatic Journal_, vol. iv. p.\r\n334).]\r\n\r\nThat Buddhism thus dispersed over eastern and central Asia became an\r\nactive agent in the promotion of whatever civilisation afterwards\r\nenlightened the races by whom its doctrines were embraced, seems to rest\r\nupon evidence which admits of no reasonable doubt. The introduction of\r\nBuddhism into China is ascertained to have been contemporary with, the\r\nearly development of the arts amongst this remarkable people, at a\r\nperiod coeval, if not anterior, to the era of Christianity.[1] Buddhism\r\nexerted a salutary influence over the tribes of Thibet; through them it\r\nbecame instrumental in humanising the Moguls; and it more or less led to\r\nthe cessation of the devastating incursions by which the hordes of the\r\nEast were precipitated over the Western Empire in the early ages of\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: MAX MÜLLER, _Hist. Sanskrit Literature_, p. 264.]\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese, and the nations of further Asia, are indebted to\r\nBuddhism for an alphabet and a literature[1]; and whatever of authentic\r\nhistory we possess in relation to these countries we owe to the\r\ninfluence of their generic religion. Nor are its effects limited to\r\nthese objects: much of what is vigorous in the character of its northern\r\nconverts may be traced to the operation of its principles, in the\r\ndevelopment of their peculiar idiosyncrasy, which, unlike that of the\r\nunwarlike Singhalese, rejected sloth and effeminacy to aim at conquest\r\nand power. Looking to the self-reliance which Buddhism inculcates, the\r\nexaltation of intellect which it proclaims, and the perfection of virtue\r\nand wisdom to which it points as within the reach of every created\r\nbeing, it may readily be imagined, that it must have wielded a spell of\r\nunusual potency, and one well calculated to awaken boldness and energy\r\nin those already animated by schemes of ambition. In Ceylon, on the\r\ncontrary, owing more or less to insulation and seclusion, Buddhism has\r\nsurvived for upwards of 2000 years as unchanged in all its leading\r\ncharacteristics as the genius of the people has remained torpid and\r\ninanimate under its influence. In this respect the Singhalese are the\r\nliving mummies of past ages; and realise in their immovable\r\ncharacteristics the Eastern fable of the city whose inhabitants were\r\nperpetuated in marble. If change has in any degree supervened, it has\r\nbeen from the corruption of the practice, not from any abandonment of\r\nthe principles, of Buddhism; and in arts, literature, and civilisation,\r\nthe records of their own history, and the ruins of their monuments,\r\nattest their deterioration in common with that of every other nation\r\nwhich has not at some time been brought under the ennobling influences\r\nof Christianity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See BURNOUF et LASSEN, _Essai sur le Pali, ou Langue Sacrée\r\nde la Presqu'ile au-dela du Gange_, ch. i., &c.]\r\n\r\nIn alluding to the doctrines of Buddhism, as it exists at the present\r\nday, my observations are to be understood as applying to the aspect\r\nunder which it presents itself in Ceylon, irrespective of the numerous\r\nforms in which it has been cultivated elsewhere. Even before the decease\r\nof the last Buddha, schisms had arisen amongst his followers in India.\r\nEighteen heresies are deplored in the _Mahawanso_ within two centuries\r\nfrom his death; and four distinct sects, each rejoicing in the name of\r\nBuddhists, are still to be traced amongst the remnants of his\r\nworshippers in Hindustan.[1] In its migrations to other countries since\r\nits dispersion by the Brahmans, Buddhism has assumed and exhibited\r\nitself in a variety of shapes. At the present day its doctrines, as\r\ncherished among the Jainas of Guzerat and Rajpootana[2], differ widely\r\nfrom its mysteries, as administered by the Lama of Thibet; and both are\r\nequally distinct from the metaphysical abstractions propounded by the\r\nmonks of Nepal. Its observances in Japan have undergone a still more\r\nstriking alteration from their vicinity to the Syntoos; and in China\r\nthey have been similarly modified in their contact with the rationalism\r\nof Lao-tsen and the social demonology of the Confucians.[3] But in each\r\nand all the distinction is in degree rather than essence; and the\r\ngeneral concurrence is unbroken in all the grand essentials of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Colebrooke's Essays on the Philosophy of the Hindoos_,\r\nsect. v. part 5, p. 401.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: An account of the religion of the Jains or Jainas, will be\r\nfound in MOUNTSTUART ELPHINSTONE'S _History of India_, vol. i. b. ii.\r\nch. 4. They arose in the sixth or seventh century, were at their height\r\nin the eleventh, and declined in the twelfth. See also MAX MÜLLER,\r\n_Hist. Sanskrit Literature_, p. 261, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Details of Buddhism in China and Chin-India will be found\r\nin the erudite commentaries of KLAPROTH, REMUSAT, and LANDRESSE.]\r\n\r\nWhilst Brahmanism, without denying the existence, practically ignores\r\nthe influence and power of a creating and controlling intelligence,\r\nBuddhism, exulting in the idea of the infinite perfectibility of man,\r\nand the achievement of the highest attainable happiness by the\r\nunfaltering practice of every conceivable virtue, exalts the individuals\r\nthus pre-eminently wise into absolute supremacy over all existing\r\nbeings, and attempts the daring experiment of an _atheistic\r\nmorality._[1] Even Buddha himself is not worshipped as a deity, or as a\r\nstill existent and active agent of benevolence and power. He is merely\r\nreverenced as a glorified remembrance, the effulgence of whose purity\r\nserves as a guide and incentive to the future struggles and aspirations\r\nof mankind. The sole superiority which his doctrines admit is that of\r\ngoodness and wisdom; and Buddha having attained to this perfection by\r\nthe immaculate purity of his actions, the absolute subjugation of\r\npassion, and the unerring accuracy of his unlimited knowledge, became\r\nentitled to the homage of all, and was required to render it to none.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: M. REMUSAT announces, as the result of his researches, that\r\nneither the Chinese; the Tartars, nor Monguls have any word in their\r\ndialects expressive of our idea of a God.--_Fo[)e] Kou[)e] Ki_, p. 138;\r\nand M. BARTHELEMY SAINT-HILLAIRE adds, that \"il n'y a pas trace de\r\nl'idée de Dieu dans le Bouddhisme entier, ni au début ni au térme.\"--_Le\r\nBouddha_, &c., Introd. p. iv. Colonel SYKES, in the xiith vol. of the\r\n_Asiatic Journal_, pp. 263 and 376, denies that Buddhism is _atheistic;_\r\nand adduces, in support of his views, allusions made by FA HIAN. But the\r\npassages to which he refers present no direct contradiction to those\r\nmetaphysical subtleties by which the Buddhistical writers have carefully\r\navoided whilst they closely approach the admission of belief in a deity.\r\nI am not prepared to deny that the faith in a supreme being may not have\r\ncharacterised Buddhism in its origin, as the belief in a Great First\r\nCause in the person of Brahma is still acknowledged by the Hindus,\r\nalthough honoured by no share of their adoration. But it admits of\r\nlittle doubt that neither in the discourses of its priesthood at the\r\npresent day nor in the practice of its followers in Ceylon is the name\r\nor the existence of an omnipotent First Cause recognised in any portion\r\nof their worship. MAUPIED has correctly described Buddhism both in\r\nCeylon and China as a system of refined atheism (_Essai sur l'Origine\r\ndes Peuples Anciens_, ch. x. p. 277), and MOUNTSTUART ELPHINSTONE gives\r\nthe weight of his high authority in the statement that \"The most ancient\r\nof Báudha sects entirely denies the being of a God; and some of those\r\nwhich admit the existence of God still refuse to acknowledge him as the\r\ncreator and ruler of the world.... The theistical sect seems to prevail\r\nin Nepaul, and the _atheistical to subsist in perfection in\r\nCeylon._\"--_History of India_, vol. i. pt. ii. ch. 4. An able writer in\r\nthe fourth volume of the _Calcutta Review_ has also controverted the\r\nassertion of its atheistic complexion; but whatever truth may be\r\ndeveloped in his views, their application is confined to Buddhism in\r\nHindustan and Nepal, and is utterly at variance with the practice and\r\nreceived dogmas in Ceylon.]\r\n\r\nExternally coinciding with Hinduism, so far as the avatar of Buddha may\r\nbe regarded as a pendant for the incarnation of Brahma, the worship of\r\nthe former is essentially distinguished from the religion of the latter\r\nin one important particular. It does not regard Buddha as an actual\r\nemanation or manifestation of the divinity, but as a guide and example\r\nto teach an enthusiastic self-reliance by means of which mankind, of\r\nthemselves and by their own unassisted exertions, are to attain to\r\nperfect virtue here and to supreme happiness hereafter. Both systems\r\ninculcate the mysterious doctrine of the metempsychosis; but whilst the\r\nresult of successive embodiments is to bring the soul of the Hindu\r\nnearer and nearer to the final beatitude of absorption into the essence\r\nof Brahma, the end and aim of the Buddhistical transmigration is to lead\r\nthe purified spirit to _Nirwana_[1], a condition between which and utter\r\nannihilation there exists but the dim distinction of a name. Nirwana is\r\nthe _exhaustion_ but not the _destruction_ of existence, the _close_ but\r\nnot the _extinction_ of being.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Nirwana\" is Sanskrit, _ni_ (_r_ euphon. causa) _wana_\r\ndesire. The Singhalese name \"Nirwana\" is also derived from _newanawa_,\r\nto extinguish. See J. BARTHELEMY SAINT-HILAIRE, _Le Bouddha_, 133, 177,\r\n&c.]\r\n\r\nIn deliberate consistency with this principle of human elevation, the\r\ndoctrines of Buddha recognise the full eligibility of every individual\r\nborn into the world for the attainment of the highest degrees of\r\nintellectual perfection and ultimate bliss; and herein consists its most\r\nstriking departure from the Brahmanical system in denying the\r\nsuperiority of the \"twice born\" over the rest of mankind; in repudiating\r\na sacerdotal supremacy of race, and in claiming for the pure and the\r\nwise that supremacy and exaltation which the self-glorified Brahmans\r\nwould monopolise for themselves.\r\n\r\nHence the supremacy of \"_caste_\" is utterly disclaimed in the sacred\r\nbooks which contain the tenets of Buddha; and although in process of\r\ntime his followers have departed from that portion of his precepts,\r\nstill distinction of birth is nowhere authoritatively recognised as a\r\nqualification for the priesthood. Buddha being in fact a deification of\r\nhuman intellect, the philanthropy of the system extends its\r\nparticipation and advantages to the whole family of mankind, the\r\nhumblest member of which is sustained by the assurance that by virtue\r\nand endurance he may attain an equality though not an identification\r\nwith the supreme intelligence. Wisdom thus exalted as the sole object of\r\npursuit and veneration, the Buddhists, with characteristic liberality,\r\nadmit that the teaching of virtue is not necessarily confined to their\r\nown professors; especially when the ceremonial of others does not\r\ninvolve the taking of life. Hence in a great degree arises the\r\nindifference of the Singhalese as to the comparative claims of\r\nChristianity and Buddhism, and hence the facility with which, both under\r\nthe Portuguese, the Dutch, and the British Government, they have\r\ncombined the secret worship of the one with the ostensible profession of\r\nthe other. They in fact admit Christ to have been a teacher, second only\r\nto Buddha, but inferior, inasmuch as the latter, who was perfect in\r\nwisdom, has attained to the bliss of Nirwana.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Sir JOHN DAVIS in his account of the Chinese, states that\r\nthe Buddhists there worship the \"_Queen of Heaven_,\" a personage\r\nevidently borrowed from the Roman Catholics, and that the name of\r\n\"_Jesus_\" appears in the list of their divinities. (Chap. xiv.)\r\n\r\nA curious illustration of the prevalence of this disposition to conform\r\nto two religions was related to me in Ceylon. A Singhalese chief came a\r\nshort time since to the principal of a government seminary at Colombo,\r\ndesirous to place his son as a pupil of the institution, and agreed,\r\nwithout an instant's hesitation, that the boy should conform to the\r\ndiscipline of the school, which requires the reading of the Scriptures\r\nand attendance at the hours of worship and prayer; accounting for his\r\nready acquiescence by an assurance that he entertained an equal respect\r\nfor the doctrines of Buddhism and Christianity. \"But how can you,\" said\r\nthe principal, \"with your superior education and intelligence, reconcile\r\nyourself thus to halt between two opinions, and submit to the\r\ninconsistency of professing an equal belief in two conflicting\r\nreligions?\" \"Do you see,\" replied the subtle chief, laying his hand on\r\nthe arm of the other, and directing his attention to a canoe, with a\r\nlarge spar as an outrigger lashed alongside, in which a fisherman was\r\njust pushing off upon the lake, \"do you see the style of these boats, in\r\nwhich our fishermen always put to sea, and that that spar is almost\r\nequivalent to a second canoe, which keeps the first from upsetting? It\r\nis precisely so with myself: I add on _your_ religion to steady my _own,\r\nbecause I consider Christianity a very safe outrigger to Buddhism._\"]\r\n\r\nAs regards the _structure of the universe_, the theories of the\r\nBuddhists, though in a great degree borrowed from the Brahmans, occupy a\r\nmuch less prominent position in their mythology, and are less intimately\r\nidentified with their system of religion. Their attention has been\r\ndirected less to physical than to metaphysical disquisitions, and their\r\nviews of cosmogony have as little of truth as of imagination in their\r\ndetails. The basis of the system is a declaration of the eternity of\r\nmatter, and its submission at remote intervals to decay and\r\nre-formation; but this and the organisation of animal life are but the\r\nresults of spontaneity and procession, not the products of will and\r\ndesign on the part of an all powerful Creator.\r\n\r\nBuddhism adopts something approaching to the mundane theory of the\r\nBrahmans, in the multiplicity and superposition of worlds and the\r\ndivision of the earth into concentric continents, each separated by\r\noceans of various fabulous liquids. Its notions of geography are at once\r\nfanciful and crude; and again borrowing from the Shastras its\r\nchronology, extends over boundless portions of time, but invests with\r\nthe authority of history only those occurrences which have taken place\r\nsince the birth of Gotama Buddha.\r\n\r\nThe Buddhists believe in the existence of _lokas_, or heavens, each\r\ndiffering in glory, and serving as the temporary residences of demigods\r\nand divinities, as well as of men whose etherialisation is but inchoate,\r\nand who have yet to visit the earth in farther births and acquire in\r\nfuture transmigrations their complete attainment of Nirwana. They\r\nbelieve likewise in the existence of hells which are the abodes of\r\ndemons or tormentors, and in which the wicked undergo a purgatorial\r\nimprisonment preparatory to an extended probation upon earth. Here their\r\ntorments are in proportion to their crimes, and although not eternal,\r\ntheir duration extends almost to the infinitude of eternity; those who\r\nhave been guilty of the deadly sins of parricide, sacrilege, and\r\ndefiance of the faith being doomed to the endurance of excruciating\r\ndeaths, followed by instant revival and a repetition of their tortures\r\nwithout mitigation and apparently without end.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: DAVY'S _Account of the Interior of Ceylon_, p. 204.]\r\n\r\nIt is one of the extraordinary anomalies of the system, that combined\r\nwith these principles of self-reliance and perfectibility, Buddhism has\r\nincorporated to a certain extent the doctrine of fate or \"necessity,\"\r\nunder which it demonstrates that adverse events are the general results\r\nof _akusala_ or moral demerit in some previous stage of existence. This\r\nbelief, which lies at the very foundation of their religion, the\r\nBuddhists have so adapted to the rest of the structure as to avoid the\r\ninconsistency of making this directing power inherent in any Supreme\r\nBeing, by assigning it as one of the attributes of matter and a law of\r\nits perpetual mutations.\r\n\r\nLike all the leading doctrines of Buddhism, however, its theories on\r\nthis subject are propounded with the usual admixture of modification and\r\ncasuistry; only a portion of men's conduct is presumed to be exclusively\r\ncontrollable by _fate_--neither moral delinquency nor virtuous actions\r\nare declared to be altogether the products of an inevitable necessity;\r\nand whilst both the sufferings and the enjoyments of mortals are\r\nrepresented as the general consequences of merit in a previous stage of\r\nexistence, even this fundamental principle is not without its exception,\r\ninasmuch as the vicissitudes are admitted to be partially the results of\r\nman's actions in this life, or of the influence of others from which his\r\nown deserts are insufficient to protect him. The main article, however,\r\nwhich admits neither of modification nor evasion, is that neither in\r\nheaven nor on earth can man escape from the _consequences_ of his acts;\r\nthat morals are in their essence productive causes, without the aid or\r\nintervention of any higher authority; and hence forgiveness or atonement\r\nare ideas utterly unknown in the despotic dogmas of Buddha.\r\n\r\nAllusion has already been made to the subtleties entertained by the\r\npriesthood, in connexion with the doctrine of the _metempsychosis_, as\r\ndeveloped in their sacred books; but the exposition would be tedious to\r\nshow the distinctions between their theories, and the opinions of\r\ntransmigration entertained by the mass of the Singhalese Buddhists. The\r\nrewards of virtue and the punishment of vice are supposed to be equally\r\nattainable in this world; and according to the amount of either, which\r\ncharacterizes the conduct of an individual in one stage of being, will\r\nbe the elevation or degradation into which he will be hereafter born.\r\n\r\nThus punishment and reward become equally fixed and inevitable: but\r\nretribution may be deferred by the intermediate exhibition of virtue,\r\nand an offering or prostration to Buddha, or an aspiration in favour of\r\nfaith in his name, will suffice to ward off punishment for a time, and\r\neven produce happiness in an intermediate birth; hence the most\r\nflagitious offender, by an act of reverence in dying, may postpone\r\nindefinitely the evil consequence of his crimes, and hence the\r\nindifference and apparent apathy which is a remarkable characteristic of\r\nthe Singhalese who suffer death for their offences[1].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Et vos barbaricos ritus, moremque sinistrum\r\n  Sacrorum Druidæ positis repetistis ab armis.\r\n  Solis nôsse deos, et coeli numina vobis\r\n  Aut solis nesclre datum: nemora alta remoti\r\n  Incolitis lucis: _vobis auctoribus umbræ\r\n  Non tacitas Erebi sedes Ditisque profundi\r\n  Pallida regna petunt: regit idem spiritus arius\r\n  Orbe alio: longæ (si canitis cognita) vitæ\r\n  Mors media, st. Certè populi quos despicit Arcios\r\n  Felices errore suo, quos ille timorum\r\n  Maximus haud urget leti metus, etc._\r\n\r\nLUCAN, l. i. 450 ct seq.]\r\n\r\nTo mankind in general Buddha came only as an adviser and a friend; but,\r\nas regards his own priesthood, he assumes all the authority of a\r\nlawgiver and chief. Spurning the desires and vanities of the world, he\r\nhas taught them to aspire to no other reward for their labours than the\r\nveneration of the human race, as teachers of knowledge and examples of\r\nbenevolence. Taking the abstract idea of perfect intelligence and\r\nimmaculate virtue for a divinity, Buddhism accords honour to all in\r\nproportion to their approaches towards absolute wisdom, and as the\r\nrealisation of this perfection is regarded as almost hopeless in a life\r\ndevoted to secular cares, the priests of Buddha, on assuming their robe\r\nand tonsure, forswear all earthly occupations; subsist on alms, not in\r\nmoney, but in food; devote themselves to meditation and self-denial;\r\nand, being thus proclaimed and recognised as the most successful\r\naspirants to Nirwana, they claim the homage of ordinary mortals,\r\nacknowledge no superior upon earth, and withhold even the tribute of a\r\nsalutation from all except the members of their own religious order.\r\n\r\nTo mankind in general the injunctions of Buddha prescribe _a code of\r\nmorality_ second only to that of Christianity, and superior to every\r\nheathen system that the world has seen.[1] It forbids the taking of life\r\nfrom even the humblest created animal, and prohibits intemperance and\r\nincontinence, dishonesty and falsehood--vices which are referable to\r\nthose formidable assailants, _rága_ or concupiscence, _doso_ or\r\nmalignity, and _moha_, ignorance or folly.[2] These, again, involve all\r\ntheir minor modifications--hypocrisy and anger, unkindness and pride,\r\nungenerous suspicion, covetousness, evil wishes to others, the betrayal\r\nof secrets, and the propagation of slander. Whilst all such offences are\r\nforbidden, every excellence is simultaneously enjoined--the forgiveness\r\nof injuries, the practice of charity, a reverence for virtue, and the\r\ncherishing of the learned; submission to discipline, veneration for\r\nparents, the care for one's family, a sinless vocation, contentment and\r\ngratitude, subjection to reproof, moderation in prosperity, submission\r\nunder affliction, and cheerfulness at all times. \"Those,\" said Buddha,\r\n\"who practise all these virtues, and are not overcome by evil, will\r\nenjoy the perfection of happiness, and attain to supreme renown.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Je n'hésite pas à ajouter que, sauf le Christ tout seul,\r\nil n'est point, parmi les fondateurs de religion de figure, plus pure ni\r\nplus touchante que celle de Bouddha. Sa vie n'a point de tache.\"--_Le\r\nBouddha_, par J. BARTHELEMY SAINT-HILAIRE, Introd. p. v.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Rev. Mr. GOGERLY's _Notes on Buddhism_. LEE's\r\n_Ribeyro_, p. 267.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Discourse of Buddha entitled _Mangala_.]\r\n\r\nBuddhism, it may be perceived from this sketch, is, properly speaking,\r\nless a form of religion than a school of philosophy; and _its worship_,\r\naccording to the institutes of its founders, consists of an appeal to\r\nthe reason, rather than an attempt on the imagination through the\r\ninstrumentality of rites and parade. \"Salvation is made dependent, not\r\nupon the practice of idle ceremonies, the repeating of prayers or of\r\nhymns, or invocations to pretended gods, but upon moral qualifications,\r\nwhich constitute individual and social happiness here, and ensure it\r\nhereafter.\"[1] In later times, and in the failure of Buddhism by\r\nunassisted arguments to ensure the observance of its precepts and the\r\npractice of its morals, the experiment has been made to arouse the\r\nattention and excite the enthusiasm of its followers by the adoption of\r\nceremonies and processions; but these are declared to be only the\r\ninnovations of priestcraft, and the Singhalese, whilst they unite in\r\ntheir celebration, are impatient to explain that such practices are less\r\nreligious than secular, and that the Perrehera in particular, the chief\r\nof their annual festivals, was introduced, not in honour of Buddha, but\r\nas a tribute to the Kandyan kings as the patrons and defenders of the\r\nfaith.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Colonel SYKES, _Asiat. Journ._, vol. xii. p. 266.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: FA HIAN describes the procession of Buddhists which he\r\nwitnessed in the kingdom of Khotan, and it is not a little remarkable,\r\nthat along with the image of Buddha were associated those of the\r\nBrahmanical deities _Indra_ and _Brahma_, the _Lha_ of the Thibetans and\r\nthe _Toeyri_ of the Moguls.]\r\n\r\nIn its formula, whatever alterations Buddhism may have undergone in\r\nCeylon are altogether external, and clearly referable to its anomalous\r\nassociation with the worship of its ancient rivals the Brahmans. These\r\nchanges, however, are the result of proximity and association rather\r\nthan of incorporation or adoption; and even now the process of\r\nexpurgation is in progress with a view to the restoration of the\r\npristine purity of the faith by a formal separation from the observances\r\nof Hinduism. The schismatic kings and the Malabar sovereigns introduced\r\nthe worship of Vishnu and Shiva into the same temples with that of\r\nBuddha.[1] The innovation has been perpetuated; and to the present day\r\nthe statues of these conflicting divinities are to be found within the\r\nsame buildings: the Dewales of Hinduism are erected within the same\r\ninclosure as the Wiharas of the Buddhists; and the Kappoorales of the\r\none religion officiate at their altars, almost beneath the same roof\r\nwith the priests and neophytes of the other. But beyond this parade of\r\ntheir emblems, the worship of the Hindu deities throughout the\r\nSinghalese districts is entirely devoid of the obscenities and cruelty\r\nby which it is characterised on the continent of India; and it would\r\nalmost appear as if these had been discontinued by the Brahmans in\r\ncompliment to the superior purity of the worship with which their own\r\nhad become thus fortuitously associated. The exclusive prejudices of\r\ncaste were at the same remote period partially engrafted on the simpler\r\nand more generous discipline of Buddha; and it is only recently that any\r\nvigorous exertions have been attempted for their disseverance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See _ante_, Vol. I. Part III. ch. viii. p. 378.]\r\n\r\nOn comparing this system with other prevailing religions which divide\r\nwith it the worship of the East, Buddhism at once vindicates its own\r\nsuperiority, not only by the purity of its code of morals, but by its\r\nfreedom from the fanatical intolerance of the Mahometans and its\r\nabhorrent rejection of the revolting rites of the Brahmanical faith. But\r\nmild and benevolent as are its aspects and design, its theories have\r\nfailed to realise in practice the reign of virtue which they proclaim.\r\nBeautiful as is the body of its doctrines, it wants the vivifying energy\r\nand soul which are essential to ensure its ascendancy and power. Its\r\ncold philosophy and thin abstractions, however calculated to exercise\r\nthe faculties of anchorets and ascetics, have proved insufficient of\r\nthemselves to arrest man in his career of passion and pursuit; and the\r\nbold experiment of influencing the heart and regulating the conduct of\r\nmankind by the external decencies and the mutual dependencies of\r\nmorality, unsustained by higher hopes and by a faith that penetrates\r\neternity, has proved in this instance an unredeemed and hopeless\r\nfailure. The inculcation of the social virtues as the consummation of\r\nhappiness here and hereafter, suggests an object sufficiently attractive\r\nfor the bulk of mankind; but Buddhism presents along with it no adequate\r\nknowledge of the means which are indispensable for its attainment. In\r\nconfiding all to the mere strength of the human intellect and the\r\nenthusiastic self-reliance and determination of the human heart, it\r\nmakes no provision for defence against those powerful temptations before\r\nwhich ordinary resolution must give way; and affords no consoling\r\nsupport under those overwhelming afflictions by which the spirit is\r\nprostrated and subdued, when unaided by the influence of a purer faith\r\nand unsustained by its confidence in a diviner power. From the\r\ncontemplation of the Buddhist all the awful and unending realities of a\r\nfuture life are withdrawn--his hopes and his fears are at once mean and\r\ncircumscribed; the rewards held in prospect by his creed are\r\ninsufficient to incite him to virtue; and its punishments too remote to\r\ndeter him from vice. Thus, insufficient for time, and rejecting\r\neternity, the utmost triumph of his religion is to live without fear and\r\nto die without hope.\r\n\r\nBoth socially and in its effects upon individuals, the result of the\r\nsystem in Ceylon has been apathy almost approaching to infidelity. Even\r\nas regards the tenets of their creed, the mass of the population exhibit\r\nthe profoundest ignorance and manifest the most irreverent indifference.\r\nIn their daily intercourse and acts, morality and virtue, so far from\r\nbeing apparent as the rule, are barely discernible as the exception.\r\nNeither hopes nor apprehensions have proved a sufficient restraint on\r\nthe habitual violation of all those precepts of charity and honesty, of\r\npurity and truth, which form the very essence of their doctrine; and in\r\nproportion as its tenets have been slighted by the people, its\r\npriesthood are disregarded, and its temples neglected.\r\n\r\nNo national system of religion, no prevailing superstition that has ever\r\nfallen under my observation presents so dull a level, and is so\r\npre-eminently deficient in popular influences, as Buddhism amongst the\r\nSinghalese. It has its multitude of followers, but it is a misnomer to\r\ndescribe them as its _votaries_, for the term implies a warmth and\r\nfervour unknown to a native of Ceylon. He believes, or he thinks he\r\nbelieves, because he is of the same faith with his ancestors; but he\r\nlooks on the religious doctrines of the various sects which surround him\r\nwith a stolid indifference which is the surest indication of the little\r\nimportance which he attaches to his own. The fervid earnestness of\r\nChristianity, even in its most degenerate forms, the fanatical\r\nenthusiasm of Islam, the proud exclusiveness of Brahma, and even the\r\nzealous warmth of other Northern faiths, are all emotions utterly\r\nforeign and unknown to the followers of Buddhism in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nYet, strange to tell, under all the icy coldness of this barren system,\r\nthere burn below the unextinguished fires of another and a darker\r\nsuperstition, whose flames overtop the icy summits of the Buddhist\r\nphilosophy, and excite a deeper and more reverential awe in the\r\nimagination of the Singhalese. As the Hindus in process of time\r\nsuperadded to their exalted conceptions of Brahma, and the benevolent\r\nattributes of Vishnu, those dismal dreams and apprehensions which embody\r\nthemselves in the horrid worship of Shiva, and in invocations to\r\npropitiate the destroyer; so the followers of Buddha, unsatisfied with\r\nthe vain pretensions of unattainable perfection, struck down by their\r\ninternal consciousness of sin and insufficiency, and seeing around them,\r\ninstead of the reign of universal happiness and the apotheosis of\r\nintellect and wisdom, nothing but the ravages of crime and the\r\nsufferings produced by ignorance, have turned with instinctive terror to\r\npropitiate the powers of evil, by whom alone such miseries are supposed\r\nto be inflicted, and to _worship the demons_ and tormentors to whom\r\ntheir superstition is contented to attribute a circumscribed portion of\r\npower over the earth.\r\n\r\nDEMON WORSHIP prevailed amongst the Singhalese before the introduction\r\nof Buddhism by Mahindo. Some principle akin to it seems to be an\r\naboriginal impulse of uncivilised man in his first and rudest\r\nconceptions of religion, engendered, perhaps, by the spectacle of\r\ncruelty and pain, the visitations of suffering and death, and the\r\ncontemplation of the awful phenomena of nature--storms, torrents,\r\nvolcanoes, earthquakes, and destruction. The conciliation of the powers\r\nwhich inflict such calamities, seems to precede, when it does not\r\nsupplant, the adoration of the benevolent influence to which belong the\r\ncreation, the preservation, and the bestowal of happiness on mankind;\r\nand in the mind of the native of Ceylon this ancient superstition has\r\nmaintained its ascendancy, notwithstanding the introduction and\r\nostensible prevalence of Buddhism; for the latter, whilst it admits the\r\nexistence of evil spirits, has emphatically prohibited their invocation,\r\non the ground that any malignant influence they may exert over man is\r\nmerely the consequence of his vices, whilst the cultivators of virtue\r\nmay successfully bid them defiance. The demons here denounced are\r\ndistinct from a class of demigods, who, under the name of _Yakshyos_,\r\nare supposed to inhabit the waters, and dwell on the sides of Mount\r\nMeru, and are distinguished not only for gentleness and benevolence but\r\neven by a veneration for Buddha, who, in one of his earlier\r\ntransmigrations, was himself born under the form of a Yakshyo, and,\r\nattended by similar companions, traversed the world teaching\r\nrighteousness. One section of these demigods, however, the _Rakshyos_,\r\nare fierce and malignant, and in these respects resemble the Yakkas or\r\ndemons so much dreaded by the Singhalese, and who, like the _Ghouls_ of\r\nthe Mahometans, are believed to infest the vicinity of graveyards, or,\r\nlike the dryads and hamadryads of the ancients, to frequent favourite\r\nforests and groves, and to inhabit particular trees, whence they sally\r\nout to seize on the passer by.[1] The Buddhist priests connive at demon\r\nworship because their efforts are ineffectual to suppress it, and the\r\nmost orthodox Singhalese, whilst they confess its impropriety, are still\r\ndriven to resort to it in all their fears and afflictions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Travellers from Point de Galle to Colombo, in driving\r\nthrough the long succession of gardens and plantations of coco-nuts\r\nwhich the road traverses throughout its entire extent, will not fail to\r\nobserve fruit-trees of different kinds, round the stem of which _a band\r\nof leaves has been fastened_ by the owner. This is to denote that the\r\ntree has been devoted to a demon; and sometimes to Vishnu or the\r\nKattregam dewol. Occasionally these dedications are made to the temples\r\nof Buddha, and even to the Roman Catholic altars, as to that of St. Anne\r\nof Calpentyn. This ceremony is called _Gok-band-ema_, \"the tying of the\r\ntender leaf,\" and its operation is to protect the fruit from pillage\r\ntill ripe enough to be plucked and sent as an offering to the divinity\r\nto whom it has thus been consecrated. There is reason to fear, however,\r\nthat on these occasions the devil is, to some extent, defrauded of his\r\ndue, as the custom is, after applying a few only of the finest as an\r\noffering to the evil one, to appropriate the remainder to the use of the\r\nowner. When coco-nut palms are so preserved, the fruit is sometimes\r\nconverted into oil and burned before the shrine of the demon. The\r\nsuperstition extends throughout other parts of Ceylon; and so long as\r\nthe wreath continues to hang upon the tree, it is presumed that no thief\r\nwould venture to plunder the garden.]\r\n\r\nIndependent of the malignant spirits or Yakkas, who are the authors of\r\nindefinite evil, the Singhalese have a demon or _Sanne_ for each form of\r\ndisease, who is supposed to be its direct agent and inflictor, and who\r\nis accordingly invoked for its removal; and others, who delight in the\r\nmiseries of mankind, are to be propitiated before the arrival of any\r\nevent over which their pernicious influence might otherwise prevail.\r\nHence, on every domestic occurrence, as well as in every domestic\r\ncalamity, the services of the _Kattadias_ or devil-priests are to be\r\nsought, and their ceremonies performed, generally with observances so\r\nbarbarous as to be the most revolting evidence still extant of the\r\nuncivilised habits of the Singhalese. Especially in cases of sickness\r\nand danger, the assistance of the devil-dancer is implicitly relied on:\r\nan altar, decorated with garlands, is erected within sight of the\r\npatient, and on this an animal, frequently a cock, is to be sacrificed\r\nfor his recovery. The dying man is instructed to touch and dedicate to\r\nthe evil spirit the wild flowers, the rice, and the flesh, which have\r\nbeen prepared as the _pidaneys_ or offerings to be made at sunset, at\r\nmidnight, and the morning; and in the intervals the dancers perform\r\ntheir incantations, habited in masks and disguises to represent the\r\ndemon which they personate, as the immediate author of the patient's\r\nsuffering. In the frenzy of these orgies, the Kattadia having feigned\r\nthe access of inspiration from the spirit he invokes, is consulted by\r\nthe friends of the afflicted, and declares the nature of his disease,\r\nand the probability of its favourable or fatal termination. At sunrise,\r\nthe ceremony closes by an exorcism chanted to disperse the demons who\r\nhave been attracted by the rite; the devil-dancers withdraw with the\r\nofferings, and sing, as they retire, the concluding song of the\r\nceremony, \"that the sacrifice may be acceptable and the life of the\r\nsufferer extended.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to this Yakka worship, which is essentially indigenous in\r\nCeylon, the natives practise the invocation of a distinct class of\r\ndemons, their conceptions of which are evidently borrowed from the\r\ndebased ceremonies of Hinduism, though in their adoption they have\r\nrejected the grosser incidents of its ritual, and replaced them with\r\nothers less cruel, but by no means less revolting. The Capuas, who\r\nperform ceremonies in honour of these strange gods, are of a higher rank\r\nthan the Kattadias, who conduct the incantations to the Yakkas, and they\r\nare more or less connected with the Dewales and temples of Hinduism. The\r\nspirits in whose honour these ceremonies are performed, are all foreign\r\nto Ceylon. Some, such as Kattregam and Pattine, are borrowed from the\r\nmythology of the Brahmans; some are the genii of fire and other elements\r\nof the universe, and others are deified heroes; but the majority are\r\ndreaded as the inflictors of pestilence and famine, and propitiated by\r\nrites to avert the visitations of their malignity.\r\n\r\nThe ascendancy of these superstitions, and the anomaly of their\r\nassociation with the religion of Buddha, which has taken for its deity\r\nthe perfection of wisdom and benevolence, present one of the most signal\r\ndifficulties with which Christianity has had, at all times, to contend\r\nin the effort to extend its influences throughout Ceylon. The Portuguese\r\npriesthood discovered that, however the Singhalese might be induced to\r\nprofess the worship of Christ, they adhered with timid tenacity to their\r\nancient demonology. The Dutch clergy, in their reiterated lamentations\r\nover the failure of their efforts for conversion, have repeatedly\r\nrecorded the fact, that however readily the native population might be\r\nbrought to abjure their belief in the doctrines of Buddha, no arguments\r\nor expedients had proved effectual to overcome their terror of the\r\ndemons, or check their propensity to resort on every emergency to the\r\nceremonies of the Capuas, the dismal rites of the devil-dancers.[1] The\r\nWesleyans, the Baptists, and other missionaries, who in later times have\r\nmade the hamlets and secluded districts of Ceylon the scene of their\r\nunwearied labours, have found, with equal disappointment, that to the\r\npresent hour the villagers and the peasantry are as powerfully attracted\r\nas ever by this strong superstition, bearing on their person the charms\r\ncalculated to protect them from the evil eye of the demon, consulting\r\nthe astrologers and the Capuas on every domestic emergency, solemnizing\r\ntheir marriages under their auspices, and requiring their presence at\r\nthe birth of their children, who, together with their mother, are not\r\nunfrequently dedicated to the evil spirits, whom they dread.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: HOUGH, _Hist. Christ. in India,_ vol. iv. b. xii. ch. v.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: HARVARD'S _History of the Wesleyan Mission in Ceylon_,\r\nIntrod., p. iii.]\r\n\r\nAs regards Buddhism itself, whilst there is that in the tenets and\r\ngenius of Brahmanism which proclaims an active resistance to any other\r\nform of religion, Christianity in the southern expanse of Ceylon has to\r\nencounter an obstacle still more embarrassing in the habitual apathy and\r\nlistless indifference of the Buddhists. Brahmanism in its constitution\r\nand spirit is essentially exclusive and fanatical, jealous of all\r\nconflicting faiths, and strongly disposed to persecution. Buddhism, on\r\nthe other hand, in the strength of its self-righteousness, extends a\r\nlatitudinarian liberality to every other belief, and exhibits a\r\nLaodicean indifference towards its own. Whilst Brahmanism is a science\r\nconfided only to an initiated priesthood; and the Vedas and the Shastras\r\nin which its precepts are embodied are kept with jealousy from the\r\nprofane eye of the people, Buddhism, rejoicing in its universality,\r\naspires to be the religion of the multitude, throws open its sacred\r\npages without restriction, and encourages their perusal as a meritorious\r\nact of devotion. The despotic ministers of Brahma affect to be versed\r\nonly in arcana and mystery, and to issue their dicta from oracular\r\nauthority; but the priesthood of Buddha assume no higher functions than\r\nthose of teachers of ethics, and claim no loftier title than that of\r\n\"the clergy of reason.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The sect of the _Lao Tsen_, or \"Doctors of Reason,\" whom\r\nLANDRESSE regards as a development of Buddhism, prevailed in Thibet and\r\nthe countries lying between China and India in the fifth and sixth\r\ncenturies; and FA HIAN always refers to them as the \"_Clergy of\r\nReason_.\"--_Fo[)e] Kou[)e] Ki_, chap. xxxviii.]\r\n\r\nIn the character of the Singhalese people there is to be traced much of\r\nthe genius of their religion. The same passiveness and love of ease\r\nwhich restrain from active exertion in the labours of life, find a\r\ncounterpart in the adjustment by which virtue is limited to abstinence,\r\nand worship to contemplation; with only so much of actual ceremonial as\r\nmay render visible to the eye what would be otherwise inaccessible to\r\nthe mind. The same love of repose which renders sleep and insensibility\r\nthe richest blessings of this life, anticipates torpor, akin to\r\nextinction, as the supremest felicity of the next. In common with all\r\nother nations they deem some form of religious worship indispensable,\r\nbut, contrary to the usage of most, they are singularly indifferent as\r\nto what that particular form is to be; leaving it passively to be\r\ndetermined by the conjunction of circumstances, the accident of\r\nlocality, and the influence of friends or worldly prospects of gain.\r\nStill, in the hands of the Christian missionary, they are by no means\r\nthe plastic substance which such a description would suggest--capable of\r\nbeing moulded into any form, or retaining permanently any casual\r\nimpression--but rather a yielding fluid which adapts its shape to that\r\nof the vessel into which it may happen to be poured, without any change\r\nin its quality or any modification of its character.\r\n\r\nFrom this unexcitable temperament of the people, combined with the\r\nexalted morals which form the articles of their belief, result phenomena\r\nwhich for upwards of three hundred years have more or less baffled the\r\nexertions of all who have laboured for the overthrow of their national\r\nsuperstition and the elevation of Christianity in its stead. The\r\nprecepts of the latter, when offered to the natives apart from the\r\ndivinity of their origin, present something in appearance so nearly akin\r\nto their own tenets that they were slow to discern the superiority. If\r\nChristianity requires purity and truth, temperance, honesty and\r\nbenevolence, these are already discovered to be enjoined with at least\r\nequal impressiveness in the precepts of Buddha. The Scripture\r\ncommandment forbidding murder is supposed to be analogous to the\r\nBuddhist prohibition to kill[1]; and where the law and the Gospel alike\r\nenforce the love of one's neighbour as the love of one's self, Buddhism\r\ninsists upon charity as the basis of worship, and calls on its own\r\nfollowers \"to appease anger by gentleness, and overcome evil by\r\ngood.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The order of Buddha not to take away life is imperative and\r\nunqualified as regards the priesthood; but to mankind in general it\r\nforms one of his \"_Sikshupada_,\" or _advices_, and admits of\r\nmodification under certain contingencies. A priest who should take away\r\nthe life of an animal, or even an insect, under any circumstances, would\r\nbe guilty of the offence denominated _Pachittvya_, and subject to penal\r\ndiscipline; but to take away human life, to be accessory to murder, or\r\nto encourage to suicide, amounts to the sin of _Parajika_, and is\r\nvisited with permanent expulsion from the order. As regards the laity,\r\nthe use of animal food is not forbidden, provided the individual has not\r\nhimself been an agent in depriving it of life. The doctrine of\r\nprohibition, however, although thus regulated, like many others of the\r\nBuddhists, by subtleties and sophistry, has proved an obstacle in the\r\nway of the Missionaries; and, coupled with the permission in the\r\nScriptures \"to slay and eat,\" it has not failed to operate prejudicially\r\nto the spread of Christianity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: From the Singhalese book, the \"_Dharmma Padan_,\" or\r\nFootsteps of Religion, portions of which are translated in \"_The\r\nFriend_,\" Colombo, 1840.]\r\n\r\nThus the outward concurrence of Christianity in those points on which it\r\nagrees with their own religion, has proved more embarrassing to the\r\nnatives than their perplexity as to others in which it essentially\r\ndiffers; till at last, too timid to doubt and too feeble to inquire,\r\nthey cling with helpless tenacity to their own superstition, and yet\r\nsubscribe to the new faith simply by adding it on to the old.\r\n\r\nCombined with this state of irresolution a serious obstacle to the\r\nacceptance of reformed Christianity by the Singhalese Buddhists has\r\narisen from the differences and disagreements between the various\r\nchurches by whose ministers it has been successively offered to them. In\r\nthe persecution of the Roman Catholics by the Dutch, the subsequent\r\nsupercession of the Church of Holland by that of England, the rivalries\r\nmore or less apparent between the Episcopalians and Presbyterians, and\r\nthe peculiarities which separate the Baptists from the Wesleyan\r\nMethodists--all of whom have their missions and representatives in\r\nCeylon--the Singhalese can discover little more than that they are\r\noffered something still doubtful and unsettled, in exchange for which\r\nthey are pressed to surrender their own ancient superstition. Conscious\r\nof their inability to decide on what has baffled the wisest of their\r\nEuropean teachers to reconcile, they hesitate to exchange for an\r\napparent uncertainty that which has been unhesitatingly believed by\r\ngenerations of their ancestors, and which comes recommended to them by\r\nall the authority of antiquity; and even when truth has been so far\r\nsuccessful as to shake their confidence in their national faith, the\r\nchoice of sects which has been offered to them leads to utter\r\nbewilderment as to the peculiar form of Christianity with which they may\r\nmost confidingly replace it.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A narrative of the efforts made by the Portuguese to\r\nintroduce Christianity, and by the Dutch to establish the reformed\r\nReligion, will be found in Sir J. EMERSON TENNENT'S _Christianity in\r\nCeylon_; together with an exposition of the systems adopted by the\r\nEuropean and American missions, and their influence on the Hindu and\r\nBuddhist races, respectively.\r\n\r\nThose who seek to pursue the study of Buddhism, its tenets and\r\neconomies, as it exhibits itself in Ceylon, will find ample details in\r\nthe two profound works published by Mr. R. SPENCE HARDY: _Eastern\r\nMonachism_, Lond. 1850, and _A Manual of Buddhism, in its Modern\r\nDevelopment_, Lond. 1853.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMEDIÆVAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nCEYLON AS KNOWN TO THE GREEKS AND ROMANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough mysterious rumours of the wealth and wonders of India had\r\nreached the Western nations in the heroic ages, and although travellers\r\nat a later period returning from Persia and the East had spread romantic\r\nreports of its vastness and magnificence, it is doubtful whether Ceylon\r\nhad been heard of in Europe[1] even by name till the companions of\r\nAlexander the Great, returning from his Indian expedition, brought back\r\naccounts of what they had been told of its elephants and ivory, its\r\ntortoises and marine monsters.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Nothing is more strikingly suggestive of the extended\r\nrenown of Ceylon and of the different countries which maintained an\r\nintercourse with the island, than the number and dissimilarity of the\r\nnames by which it has been known at various periods throughout Europe\r\nand Asia. So remarkable is this peculiarity, that LASSEN has made \"the\r\nnames of Taprobane\" the subject of several learned disquisitions (_De\r\nTaprobane Insula veter. cogn. Dissert_. sec. 2, p. 5; _Indische\r\nAlterthumskunde_, vol. i. p. 200, note viii. p. 212, &c.); and BURNOUF\r\nhas devoted two elaborate essays to their elucidation, _Journ. Asiat_.\r\n1826, vol. viii. p. 129. _Ibid_., 1857, vol. xxxiii. p. 1.\r\n\r\nIn the literature of the Brahmans, Lanka, from having been the scene of\r\nthe exploits of Rama, is as renowned as Ilion in the great epic of the\r\nGreeks. \"Taprobane,\" the name by which the island was first known to the\r\nMacedonians, is derivable from the Pali \"Tamba panni.\" The origin of the\r\nepithet will be found in the _Mahawanso_, ch. vii. p. 56. and it is\r\nfurther noticed in the present work, Vol. I. P. 1. ch. i. p. 17, and P.\r\nIII. ch. ii. p. 330.--It has likewise been referred to the Sanskrit\r\n\"_Tambrapani_;\" which, according to LASSEN, means \"the great pond,\" or\r\n\"the pond covered with the red lotus,\" and was probably associated with\r\nthe gigantic tanks for which Ceylon is so remarkable. In later times\r\nTaprobane was exchanged for Simundu, Palai-simundu, and Salike, under\r\nwhich names it is described by PTOLEMY, the author of the _Periplus_,\r\nand by MARCIANUS of Heraclæa. _Palai-simundu_, LASSEN conjectures to be\r\nderived from the Sanskrit _Pali-simanta_, \"the head of the sacred law,\"\r\nfrom Ceylon having become the great centre of the Buddhist faith (_De\r\nTaprob_., p. 16; _Indische Alter_. vol. i. p. 200); and _Salike_ he\r\nregards merely as a seaman's corruption of \"Sinhala or Sihala,\" the name\r\nchosen by the Singhalese themselves, and signifying \"the dwelling place\r\nof lions.\" BURNOUF suggests whether it may not be _Sri-Lanka_, or \"Lanka\r\nthe Blessed.\"\r\n\r\n_Sinhala_, with the suffix of \"diva,\" or \"dwipa\" (island), was\r\nsubsequently converted into \"Silan-dwipa\" and \"Seren-diva,\" whence the\r\n\"Serendib\" of the Arabian navigators and their romances; and this in\r\nlater times was contracted into Zeilan by the Portuguese, Ceylan by the\r\nDutch, and Ceylon by the English. VINCENT, in his _Commentary on the\r\nPeriplus of the Erythræan Sea_, vol. ii. p. 493, has enumerated a\r\nvariety of other names borne by the island; and to all these might be\r\nfurther added those assigned to it in China, in Siam, in Hindustan,\r\nKashmir, Persia, and other countries of the East. The learned ingenuity\r\nof BOCHART applied a Hebrew root to expound the origin of Taprobane\r\n(_Geogr. Sac._ lib. ii. ch. xxviii.); but the later researches of\r\nTURNOUR, BURNOUF, and LASSEN have traced it with certainty to its Pali\r\nand Sanskrit origin.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: GOSSELIN, in his _Recherches sur la Géographie des\r\nAnciens_, tom. iii. p. 291, says that Onesicritus, the pilot of\r\nAlexander's fleet, \"avoit visité la Taprobane pendant un nouveau voyage\r\nqu'il eut ordre de faire.\" If so, he was the first European on record\r\nwho had seen the island; but I have searched unsuccessfully for any\r\nauthority to sustain this statement of GOSSELIN.]\r\n\r\nSo vague and uncertain was the information thus obtained, that STRABO,\r\nwriting upwards of two centuries later, manifests irresolution in\r\nstating that Taprobane was an island[1]; and POMPONIUS MELA, who wrote\r\nearly in the first century of the Christian era, quotes as probable the\r\nconjecture of HIPPARCHUS, that it was not in reality an island, but the\r\ncommencement of a south-eastern continent[2]; an opinion which PLINY\r\nrecords as an error that had prevailed previous to his own time, but\r\nwhich he had been enabled to correct by the information received from\r\nthe ambassador who had been sent from Ceylon to the Emperor Claudius.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: STRABO, l. ii. c.i.s. 14, c.v.s. 14, [Greek: einai phasi\r\nnêson]; l. xv. c.i.s. 14.

Min._.,\r\nvol. i. p. 97.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: PLINY, 1. vi. c. 24.]\r\n\r\nIn the treatise _De Mundo_, which is ascribed to ARISTOTLE[1], Taprobane\r\nis mentioned incidentally as of less size than Britain; and this is\r\nprobably the earliest historical notice of Ceylon that has come down to\r\nus[2] as the memoirs of Alexander's Indian officers, on whose authority\r\nAristotle (if he be the author of the treatise \"_De Mundo_\") must have\r\nwritten, survive only in fragments, preserved by the later historians\r\nand geographers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: I have elsewhere disposed of the alleged allusions of\r\nSanchoniathon to an island which was obviously meant for Ceylon. (See\r\nNote (A) end of this chapter.) The authenticity of the treatise _De\r\nMundo_, as a production of ARISTOTLE, is somewhat doubtful (SCHOELL,\r\n_Literat. Grecque_, liv. iv. c. xl.); and it might add to the suspicion\r\nof its being a modern composition, that Aristotle should do no more than\r\nmention the name and size of a country of which Onesicritus and Nearchus\r\nhad just brought home accounts so surprising; and that he should speak\r\nof it with confidence as an island; although the question of its\r\ninsularity remained somewhat uncertain at a much later period.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Fabricius, in the supplemental volume of his _Codex\r\nPseudepigraphi veteris Testamenti,_ Hamb., A.D. 1723, says: \"Samarita,\r\nGenesis, viii. 4, tradit Noæ arcam requievisse super montem [Greek: tês]\r\nSerendib sive Zeylan.\"--P. 30; and it was possibly upon this authority\r\nthat it has been stated in Kitto's _Cyclopoedia of Biblical Literature,_\r\nvol. i. p. 199, as \"a curious circumstance that in Genesis, viii. 4, the\r\nSamaritan Pentateuch has Sarandib, the Arabic name of Ceylon,\" instead\r\nof Ararat, as the resting place of the ark. Were this true, it would\r\ngive a triumph to speculation, and serve by a single but irresistible\r\nproof to dissipate doubt, if there were any, as to the early intercourse\r\nbetween the Hebrews and that island as the country from which Solomon\r\ndrew his triennial supplies of ivory, apes, and peacocks (1 Kings, x.\r\n22). Assuming the correctness of the opinion that the Samaritan\r\nPentateuch is as old as the separation of the tribes in the reign of\r\nRehoboam, B. C. 975-958, this would not only furnish a notice of Ceylon\r\nfar anterior to any existing authority; but would assign an antiquity\r\nirreconcilable with historical evidence as to its comparatively modern\r\nname of \"Serendib.\" The interest of the discovery would still be\r\nextraordinary, even if the Samaritan Pentateuch be referred to the later\r\ndate assigned to it by Frankel, who adduces evidence to show that its\r\nwriter had made use of the Septuagint. The author of the article in the\r\n_Biblical Cyclopoedia_ is however in error. Every copy of the Samaritan\r\nPentateuch, both those printed in the Paris _Polyglot_ and in that of\r\nWalton, as well as the five MSS. in the Bodleian Library at Oxford,\r\nwhich contain the eighth chapter of Genesis, together with several\r\ncollations of the Hebrew and Samaritan text, make no mention of\r\nSarandib, but all exhibit the word \"Ararat\" in its proper place in the\r\neighth chapter of Genesis. \"Ararat\" is also found correctly in BLAYNET'S\r\n_Pentat, Hebroeo-Samarit.,_ Oxford, 1790.\r\n\r\nBut there is another work in which \"Sarandib\" does appear in the verse\r\nalluded to. PIETRO DELLA VALLE, in that most interesting letter in which\r\nhe describes the manner in which he obtained at Damascus, in A.D. 1616,\r\na manuscript of the Pentateuch on parchment in the Hebrew language, but\r\nwritten in Samaritan characters; relates that along with it he procured\r\n_another_ on paper, in which not only the letters, but the language, was\r\nSamaritan--\"che non solo è seritto con lettere Samaritane, ma in lingua\r\nanche propria de' Samaritani, che è un misto della Ebraica e della\r\nCaldea.\"--_Viaggi, &c.,_ Lett. da Aleppo, 15. di Giugno A.D. 1616.\r\n\r\nThe first of these two manuscripts is the Samaritan Pentateuch, the\r\nsecond is the \"_Samaritan version_\" of it. The author and age of the\r\nsecond are alike unknown; but it cannot, in the opinion of Frankel, date\r\nearlier than the second century, or a still later period. (DAVISON'S\r\n_Biblical Criticism,_ vol. i, ch. xv. p. 242.) Like all ancient targums,\r\nit bears in some particulars the character of a paraphrase; and amongst\r\nother departures from the literal text of the original Hebrew, the\r\ntranslator, following the example of Onkelos and others, has substituted\r\nmodern geographical names for some of the more ancient, such as\r\n_Gerizim_ for Mount Ebal (Deut. xxvii. 4), _Paneas_ for Dan, and\r\n_Ascalon_ for Gerar; and in the 4th verse of the viiith chapter of\r\nGenesis he has made the ark to rest \"_upon the mountains of Sarandib._\"\r\nOnkelos in the same passage has _Kardu_ in place of Ararat. See WALTON'S\r\n_Polyglot_, vol. i. p. 31; BASTOW, _Bibl. Dict._ 1847, vol. i. p. 71.\r\n\r\nAccording to the _Mahawanso_, the epithet of Sihale-dwipa, the _island\r\nof lions_, was conferred upon Ceylon by the followers of Wijayo, B.C.\r\n543 (_Mahawanso_, ch. vii. p. 51), and from this was formed, by the\r\nArabian seamen, the names Silan-dip and Seran-dib. The occurrence of the\r\nlatter word, therefore, in the \"Samaritan Pentateuch,\" if its antiquity\r\nbe referable to the reign of Rehoboam, would be inexplicable; whereas no\r\nanachronism is involved by its appearance in the \"Samaritan _version_,\"\r\nwhich was not written till many centuries after the Wijayan conquest.\r\n\r\nThere is another manuscript, written on bombycine, in the Bodleian\r\nLibrary, No. 345, described as an Arabic version of the Pentateuch,\r\nwritten between the years 884 and 885 of the Hejira, A.D. 1479 and 1480,\r\nand ascribed to Aba Said, son of Abul Hassan, \"in eo continetur versio\r\nArabica Pentateuchi quæ ex textu Hebræico-Samaritano _non ex versione\r\nilia quæ dialecto quadam peculieri Samaritanis quondam vernacula Scripta\r\nest_.\"--_Cat. Orient. MSS._ vol. I. p. 2. In this manuscript, also, the\r\nword _Sarendip_ instead of Ararat, occurs in the passage in Genesis\r\ndescriptive of the resting of the ark.]\r\n\r\nFrom their compilations, however, it appears that the information\r\nconcerning Ceylon collected by the Macedonian explorers of India, was\r\nboth meagre and erroneous. ONESICRITUS, as he is quoted by Strabo and\r\nPliny, propagated exaggerated statements as to the dimensions of the\r\nisland[1] and the number of herbivorous cetacea[2] found in its seas;\r\nthe elephants he described as far surpassing those of continental India\r\nboth in courage and in size.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: These early errors as to the and position of Ceylon will be\r\nfound explained elsewhere. See Vol. I. P. 1. ch. i. p. 81.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: STRABO, xv. p. 691. The animal referred to by the\r\ninformants of Onesicritus was the dugong, whose form and attitudes gave\r\nrise to the fabled mermaid. See Ælian, lib. xvi. ch. xviii., who says it\r\nhas the face of a woman and spines that resemble hair.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: PLINY, lib. vi. ch. 24.]\r\n\r\nMEGASTHENES, twenty years after the death of Alexander the Great, was\r\naccredited as an ambassador from Seleucus Nicator to the court of\r\nSandracottus, or Chandra-Gupta, the King of the Prasii, from whose\r\ncountry Ceylon had been colonised two centuries before by the expedition\r\nunder Wijayo.[1] It was, perhaps, from the latter circumstance and the\r\ncommunication subsequently maintained between the insular colony and the\r\nmother country, that Megasthenes, who never visited any part of India\r\nsouth of the Ganges, and who was, probably, the first European who ever\r\nbeheld that renowned river[1], was nevertheless enabled to collect many\r\nparticulars relative to the interior of Ceylon. He described it as being\r\ndivided by a river (the Mahawelli-ganga?) into two sections, one\r\ninfested by wild beasts and elephants, the other producing gold and\r\ngems, and inhabited by a people whom he called Palæogoni[2], a\r\nhellenized form of _Pali-Putra,_ \"the sons of the Pali,\" the first\r\nPrasian colonists.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Vol. I. P. III. ch. iii. p. 336.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: ROBEBTSON'S _Ancient India,_ sec. ii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: SCHWANBECK'S _Megasthenes, Fragm._ xviii.; SOLINUS\r\nPOLYHISTOR, lii. 3; PLINY, lvi. ch. 24. ÆLIAN, in compiling his _Natura\r\nAnimalium,_ has introduced the story told by MEGASTHENES, and quoted by\r\nSTRABO, of cetaceous animals in the seas of Ceylon with heads resembling\r\noxen and lions; and this justifies the conjecture that other portions of\r\nthe same work referring to the island may have been simultaneously\r\nborrowed from the same source. SCHWANBECK, apparently on this ground,\r\nhas included among the _Fragmenta incerta_ those passages from ÆLIAN,\r\nlib, xvi. ch. 17, 18, in which he says, and truly, that in Taprobane\r\nthere were no cities, but from five to seven hundred villages built of\r\nwood, thatched with reeds, and occasionally covered with the shells of\r\nlarge tortoises. The sea coast then as now was densely covered with\r\npalm-trees (evidently coco-nut and Palmyra), and the forests contained\r\nelephants so superior to those of India that they were shipped in large\r\nvessels and sold to the King of Calinga (Northern Circars). The island,\r\nhe says, is so large that \"those in the maritime districts never hunted\r\nin the interior, and those in the interior had never seen the sea.\"]\r\n\r\nSuch was the scanty knowledge regarding India communicated to Europe by\r\nthose who had followed the footsteps of conquest into that remote\r\nregion; and although eighteen centuries elapsed from the death of\r\nAlexander the Great before another European power sought to establish\r\nits dominion in the East, a new passion had been early implanted, the\r\ncultivation of which was in the highest degree favourable to the\r\nacquisition and diffusion of geographical knowledge. In an age before\r\nthe birth of history[1], the adventurous Phoenicians, issuing from the\r\nRed Sea, in their ships, had reached the shores of India, and centuries\r\nafterwards their experienced seamen piloted the fleets of Solomon in\r\nsearch of the luxuries of the East.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A compendious account of the early trade between India and\r\nthe countries bordering on the Mediterranean will be found in\r\nPARDESSUS's _Collection des Lois Maritimes antérieures au XVIII^e\r\nsiècle_, tom. i. p. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It has been conjectured, and not without reason, that it\r\nmay possibly have been from Ceylon and certainly from Southern India\r\nthat the fleets of Solomon were returning when \"once in every three\r\nyears came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold and silver, ivory, apes,\r\nand peacocks.\"--_I Kings_, x. 22, _II Chron._, xx. 21. An exposition of\r\nthe reasons for believing that the site of Tarshish may be recognised in\r\nthe modern Point de Galle will be found in a subsequent chapter\r\ndescriptive of that ancient emporium. See also Note A at the end of this\r\nchapter.]\r\n\r\nEgypt, under the Ptolemies, became the seat of that opulent trade which\r\nit had been the aim of Alexander the Great to divert to it from Syria.\r\nBerenice was built on the Red Sea, as an emporium for the ships engaged\r\nin Indian voyages, and Alexandria excelled Tyre in the magnitude and\r\nsuccess of her mercantile operations.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Egypt by Augustus, so far from checking, served to\r\ncommunicate a fresh impulse to the intercourse with India, whence all\r\nthat was costly and rare was collected in wanton profusion, to minister\r\nto the luxury of Rome. A bold discovery of the same period imparted an\r\nentirely new character to the navigation of the Indian Ocean. The\r\nprevious impediment to trade had been the necessity of carrying it on in\r\nsmall vessels, that crept cautiously along the windings of the shore,\r\nthe crews being too ignorant and too timid to face the dangers of the\r\nopen sea. But the courage of an individual at length solved the\r\ndifficulty, and dissipated the alarm. Hippalus, a seaman in the reign of\r\nClaudius, observing the steady prevalence of the monsoons[1], which blew\r\nover the Indian Ocean alternately from east to west, dared to trust\r\nhimself to their influence, and departing from the coast of Arabia, he\r\nstretched fearlessly across the unknown deep, and was carried by the\r\nwinds to Muziris, a port on the coast of Malabar, the modern Mangalore.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Arabic \"_maussam_.\" I believe the root belongs to a dialect\r\nof India, and signifies \"seasons.\" VINCENT fixes the discovery of the\r\nmonsoons by Hippalus about the year A.D. 47, although it admits of no\r\ndoubt that the periodical prevalence of the winds must have been known\r\nlong before, if not partially taken advantage of by the seamen of Arabia\r\nand India. _Periplus, &c._, vol. ii, pp. 24--57.]\r\n\r\nAn exploit so adventurous and so triumphant, rendered Hippalus the\r\nColumbus of his age, and his countrymen, to perpetuate his renown,\r\ncalled the winds which he had mastered by his name.[1] His discovery\r\ngave a new direction to navigation, it altered the dimensions and build\r\nof the ships frequenting those seas [2], and imparted so great an\r\nimpulse to trade, that within a very brief period it became a subject of\r\napprehension at Rome, lest the empire should be drained of its specie to\r\nmaintain the commerce with India. Silver to the value of nearly a\r\nmillion and a half sterling, being annually required to pay for the\r\nspices, gems, pearls, and silks, imported through Egypt.[3] An extensive\r\nacquaintance was now acquired with the sea-coast of India, and the great\r\nwork of Pliny, compiled less than fifty years after the discovery of\r\nHippalus, serves to attest the additional knowledge regarding Ceylon\r\nwhich had been collected during the interval.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Periplus, &c._, HUDSON, p. 32; PLINY, lib. vi, ch. 26. A\r\nlearned disquisition on the discovery of the monsoons will be found in\r\nVINCENT's _Commerce of the Ancients_, vol. i. pp. 47, 253; vol. ii. pp.\r\n49; 467; ROBERTSON's _India_, sec. ii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: PLINY, lib. vi. ch. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: PLINY, lib. vi. ch. 26. The nature of this rich trade is\r\nfully described by the author of the _Periplus of the Erythrean Sea_,\r\nwho was himself a merchant engaged in it.]\r\n\r\nPliny, writing in the first century, puts aside the fabulous tales\r\npreviously circulated concerning the island[1]; he gives due credit to\r\nthe truer accounts of Onesicritus and Megasthenes, and refers to the\r\nlater works of ERATOSTHENES and ARTEMIDORUS[2] the geographers, as to\r\nits position, its dimensions, its cities, its natural productions, and\r\nas to the ignorance of navigation exhibited by its inhabitants. All\r\nthis, he says, was recorded by former writers, but it had fallen to his\r\nlot to collect information from natives of Ceylon who had visited Rome\r\nduring his own time under singular circumstances. A ship had been\r\ndespatched to the coast of Arabia to collect the Red Sea revenues, but\r\nhaving been caught by the monsoon it was carried to Hippuros, the modern\r\nKudra-mali, in the north-west of Ceylon, near the pearl banks of Manaar.\r\nHere the officer in command was courteously received by the king, who,\r\nstruck with admiration of the Romans and eager to form an alliance with\r\nthem, despatched an embassy to Italy, consisting of a Raja and suite of\r\nthree persons.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: I have not thought it necessary to advert to the romance of\r\nJAMBULUS, the scene of which has been conjectured, but without any\r\njustifiable grounds, to be laid in Ceylon; and which is strangely\r\nincorporated with the authentic work of DIODORUS SICULUS, written in the\r\nage of Augustus. DIODORUS professes to give it as an account of the\r\n_recent discovery_ of an island to which it refers; a fact sufficiently\r\ndemonstrative of its inapplicability to Ceylon, the existence of which\r\nhad been known to the Greeks three hundred years before. It is the story\r\nof a merchant made captive by pirates and carried to Æthiopia, where, in\r\ncompliance with a solemn rite, he and a companion were exposed in a\r\nboat, which, after a voyage of four months, was wafted to one of the\r\nFortunate Islands, in the Southern Sea, where he resided seven years,\r\nwhence having been expelled, he made his way to Palibothra, on the\r\nGanges, and thence returned to Greece. In the pretended account of this\r\nisland given by JAMBULUS I cannot discover a single attribute sufficient\r\nto identify it with Ceylon. On the contrary, the traits which he\r\nnarrates of the country and its inhabitants, when they are not manifest\r\ninventions, are obviously borrowed from the descriptions of the\r\ncontinent of India, given by CTESIAS and MEGASTHENES. PRINSEP, in his\r\nlearned analysis of the Sanchi Inscription, shows that what JAMBULUS\r\nsays of the alphabet of his island agrees minutely with the character\r\nand symbols on the ancient Buddhist lats of Central India. _Journ.\r\nAsiat. Soc. Ben._, vol. vi. p. 476. WILFORD, in his _Essay on the Sacred\r\nIsles of the West, Asiat. Res._ x. 150, enumerates the statements of\r\nJAMBULUS which might possibly apply to Sumatra, but certainly not to\r\nCeylon, an opinion in which he had been anticipated by RAMUSIO, vol. i.\r\np. 176. LASSEN, in his _Indische Alterthumskunde_, vol. iii. p. 270,\r\nassigns his reasons for believing that Bali, to the east of Java, must\r\nbe the island in which JAMBULUS laid the scene of his adventures.\r\nDIODORUS SICULUS, lib. ii. ch. lv., &c. An attempt has also been made to\r\nestablish an identity between Ceylon and the island of Panchoea, which\r\nDiodoras describes in the Indian Sea, between Arabia and Gedrosia (lib.\r\nv. 41, &c.); but the efforts of an otherwise ingenious writer have been\r\nunsuccessful. See GROVER's _Voice from Stonehenge_, P. i. p. 95.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: PLINY, lib. xxii. ch. liii. iv. ch. xxiv. vii. ch. ii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"Legatos quatuor misit principe eoram Rachia.\"--PLINY, lib.\r\nvi. c. 24. This passage is generally understood to indicate four\r\nambassadors, of whom the principal was one named Rachias. CASIE CHITTY,\r\nin a learned paper on the early _History of Jaffna_, offers another\r\nconjecture that \"Rachia\" may mean _Arachia_, a Singhalese designation of\r\nrank which exists to the present day; and in support of his hypothesis\r\nhe instances the coincidence that \"at a later period a similar\r\nfunctionary was despatched by the King Bhuwaneka-Bahu VIII. as\r\nambassador to the court of Lisbon.\"--_Journal Ceylon Asiat.

But as the\r\nembassy sent to the Emperor Claudius would necessarily have been deputed\r\nby one of the kings of the Wijayan dynasty, it is more than probable\r\nthat the rank of the envoy was Indian rather than Singhalese, and that\r\n\"Rachia\" means _raja_ rather than _arachy_.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be observed that Rackha is a name of some renown in\r\nSinghalese annals. Rackha was the general whom Prakrama Bahu sent to\r\nreduce the south of Ceylon when in arms in the 12th century\r\n(_Mahawanso_, ch. lxxiii.); and it is also the name of one of the heroes\r\nof the Paramas. WILFORD, _As. Res._, vol. ix. p. 41.]\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese king of whom this is recorded was probably\r\nChanda-Mukha-Siwa, who ascended the throne A.D. 44, and was deposed and\r\nassassinated by his brother A.D. 52. He signalised his reign by the\r\nconstruction of one of those gigantic tanks which still form the wonders\r\nof the island.[1] From his envoys Pliny learned that Ceylon then\r\ncontained five hundred towns (or more properly villages), of which the\r\nchief was Palæsimunda, the residence of the sovereign, with a population\r\nof two hundred thousand souls.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxx. p. 218; TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, p. 21;\r\nAMMIANUS MARCELLINUS mentions another embassy which arrived from Ceylon\r\nin the reign of the Emperor Julian, l. xx. c. 7, and which consequently\r\nmust have been despatched by the king Upa-tissa II. I have elsewhere\r\nremarked, that it was in this century that the Singhalese appear to have\r\nfirst commenced the practice of sending frequent embassies to distant\r\ncountries, and especially to China. (See chapter on the Knowledge of\r\nCeylon possessed by the Chinese.)]\r\n\r\nThey spoke of a lake called Megisba, of vast magnitude, and giving rise\r\nto two rivers, one flowing by the capital and the other northwards,\r\ntowards the continent of India, which was most likely an exaggerated\r\naccount of some of the great tanks, possibly that of Tissaweva, in the\r\nvicinity of Anarajapoora. They described the coral which abounds in the\r\nGulf of Manaar; and spoke of marble, with colours like the shell of the\r\ntortoise; of pearls and precious stones; of the luxuriance of the soil,\r\nthe profusion of all fruits except that of the vine, the natural wealth\r\nof the inhabitants, the mildness of the government, the absence of\r\nvexatious laws, the happiness of the people, and the duration of life,\r\nwhich was prolonged to more than one hundred years. They spoke of a\r\ncommerce with China, but it was evidently overland, by way of India and\r\nTartary, the country of the Seres being visible, they said, beyond the\r\nHimalaya mountains.[1] The ambassadors described the mode of trading\r\namong their own countrymen precisely as it is practised by the Veddahs\r\nin Ceylon at the present day[2]; the parties to the barter being\r\nconcealed from each other, the one depositing the articles to be\r\nexchanged in a given place, and the other, if they agree to the terms,\r\nremoving them unseen, and leaving behind what they give in return.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to read this narrative of Pliny without being struck\r\nwith its fidelity to truth in many particulars; and even one passage, to\r\nwhich exception has been taken as an imposture of the Singhalese envoys,\r\nwhen they manifested surprise at the quarters in which the sun rose and\r\nset in Italy, has been referred[3] to the peculiar system of the Hindus,\r\nin whose maps north and south are left and right; but it may be\r\nexplained by the fact of the sun passing overhead in Ceylon, in his\r\ntransit to the northern solstice; instead of hanging about the south, as\r\nin Italy, after acquiring some elevation above the horizon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Ultra montes Emodos Seras quoque ab ipsis aspici notos\r\netiam commercio.\"--PLINY, lib. vi. c. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See the chapter on the Veddahs, Vol. II. Part II. ch. iii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See WILFORD'S _Sacred Islands of the West, Asiat. Res_.,\r\nvol. x. p. 41.]\r\n\r\nThe rapid progress of navigation and discovery in the Indian seas,\r\nwithin the interval of sixty or seventy years which elapsed between the\r\ndeath of Pliny and the compilation of the great work of Ptolemy is in no\r\ninstance more strikingly exhibited than on comparing the information\r\nconcerning Taprobane, which is given by the latter in his \"System of\r\nGeography,\"[1] with the meagre knowledge of the island possessed by all\r\nhis predecessors. From his position at Alexandria and his opportunites\r\nof intercourse with mariners returning from their distant voyages, he\r\nenjoyed unusual facilities for ascertaining facts and distances, and in\r\nproof of his singular diligence he was enabled to lay down in his map of\r\nCeylon the position of eight promontories upon its coast, the mouths of\r\nfive principal rivers, four bays, and harbours; and in the interior he\r\nhad ascertained that there were thirteen provincial divisions, and\r\nnineteen towns, besides two emporiums on the coast; five great estuaries\r\nwhich he terms lakes[2], two bays, and two chains of mountains, one of\r\nthem surrounding Adam's Peak, which he designates as Maloea--the name by\r\nwhich the hills that environ it are known in the _Mahawanso_. He\r\nmentions the recent change of the name to Salike (which Lassen\r\nconjectures to be a seaman's corruption of the real name Sihala[3]); and\r\nhe notices, in passing, the fact that the natives wore their hair then\r\nas they do at the present day, in such length and profusion as to give\r\nthem an appearance of effeminacy, \"[Greek: mallois gynaikeiois eis hapan\r\nanadedemenos].\"[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: PTOLEMY, _Geog_. lib. vii. c. 4, tab. xii, Asiæ. In one\r\nimportant particular a recent author has done justice to the genius and\r\nperseverance of Ptolemy, by demonstrating that although mistaken in\r\nadopting some of the fallacious statements of his predecessors, he has\r\navailed himself of better data by which to fix the position of Ceylon;\r\nso that the western coast in the Ptolemaic map coincides with the modern\r\nCeylon in the vicinity of Colombo. Mr. COOLEY, in his learned work on\r\n_Claudius Ptolemy and the Nile_, Lond. 1854, has successfully shown that\r\nwhilst forced to accept those popular statements which he had no\r\nauthentic data to check, Ptolemy conscientiously availed himself of the\r\nbest materials at his command, and endeavoured to fix his distances by\r\nmeans of the reports of the Greek seamen who frequented the coasts which\r\nhe described, constructing his maps by means of their itineraries and\r\nthe journals of trading voyages. But a fundamental error pervades all\r\nhis calculations, inasmuch as he assumed that there were but 500 stadia\r\n(about fifty geographical miles) instead of sixty miles to a degree of a\r\ngreat circle of the earth; thus curtailing the globe of one sixth of its\r\ncircumference. Once apprised of this mistake, and reckoning Ptolemy's\r\nlongitudes and latitudes from Alexandria, and reducing them to degrees\r\nof 600 stadia, his positions may be laid down on a more correct\r\ngraduation; otherwise \"his Taprobane, magnified far beyond its true\r\ndimensions, appears to extend two degrees below the equator, and to the\r\nseventy-first meridian east of Alexandria (nearly twenty degrees too far\r\neast), _whereas the prescribed reduction brings it westward and\r\nnorthward till it covers the modern Ceylon_, the western coasts of both\r\ncoinciding at the very part near Colombo likely to have been visited by\r\nshipping.\"--Pp. 47, 53, See also SCHOELL, _Hist, de la Lit. Grecque_, l.\r\nv. c. lxx.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It is observable that Ptolemy in his list distinguishes\r\nthose indentations in the coast which he described as _bays_, [Greek:\r\nkolpos], from the estuaries, to which he gives the epithet of \"lakes,\"\r\n[Greek: limên]. Of the former he particularises two, the position of\r\nwhich would nearly correspond with the Bay of Trincomalie and the\r\nharbour of Colombo. Of the latter he enumerates five, and from their\r\nposition they seem to represent the peculiar estuaries formed by the\r\nconjoint influence of the rivers and the current, and known by the Arabs\r\nby the term of \"_gobbs_.\" A description of them will be found at Vol. I.\r\nPart I. ch. i. p. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: May it not have an Egyptian origin \"Siela-Keh,\" the _land_\r\nof _Siela_?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The description of Taprobane given by Ptolemy proves that\r\nthe island had been thoroughly circumnavigated and examined by the\r\nmariners who were his informants. Not having penetrated the interior to\r\nany extent, their reports relative to it are confined to the names of\r\nthe principal tribes inhabiting the several divisions and provinces, and\r\nthe position of the metropolis and seat of government. But respecting\r\nthe coast, their notes were evidently minute and generally accurate, and\r\nfrom them Ptolemy was enabled to enumerate in succession the bays,\r\nrivers, and harbours, together with the headlands and cities on the\r\nseaborde in consecutive order; beginning at the northern extremity,\r\nproceeding southward down the western coast, and returning along the\r\neast to Point Pedro. Although the majority of the names which he\r\nsupplies are no longer susceptible of identification on the modern map,\r\nsome of them can be traced without difficulty--thus his _Ganges_ is\r\nstill the Mahawelli-ganga; his _Maagrammum_ would appear, on a first\r\nglance, to be Mahagam, but as he calls it the \"metropolis,\" and places\r\nit beside the great river, it is evidently Bintenne, whose ancient name\r\nwas \"Maha-yangana\" or \"Ma-ha-welli-gam.\" His _Anurogrammum_, which he\r\ncalls [Greek: Basileion], \"the royal residence,\" is obviously\r\nAnarajapoora, the city founded by Anuradha five hundred years before\r\nPtolemy was born (_Mahawanso_, ch. vii. p. 50, x. 65, &c.). It may have\r\nborne in his time the secondary rank of a village or a town (_gam_ or\r\n_gramma_), and afterwards acquired the higher epithet of\r\nAnuradha-_porra_, the \"city\" of Anuradha, after it had grown to the\r\ndimensions of a capital. The province of the _Modutti_ in Ptolemy's list\r\nhas a close resemblance in name, though not in position, to Mantotte;\r\nthe people of Rayagam Corle still occupy the country assigned by him to\r\nthe _Rhogandani_--his _Naga dibii_ are identical with the Nagadiva of\r\nthe _Mahawanso_; and the islet to which he has given the name of\r\n_Bassa_, occupies nearly the position of the Basses, which it has been\r\nthe custom to believe were so called by the Portuguese--\"Baxos\" or\r\n\"Baixos,\" _sunken rocks_. It is curious that the position in which he\r\nhas placed the elephant plains or feeding grounds, [Greek: elephantôn\r\nnomoi], to the south-east of Adam's Peak, is the portion of the island\r\nabout Matura, where, down to a very recent period, the Portuguese, the\r\nDutch, and the English successively held their annual battues, not only\r\nfor the supply of the government studs, but for export to India. Making\r\ndue allowance for the false dimensions of the island assumed by Ptolemy,\r\nbut taking his account of the relative positions of the headlands,\r\nrivers, harbours, and cities, the accompanying map affords a proximate\r\nidea of his views of Taprobane and its localities as propounded in his\r\nGeography.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Post-scriptum._ Since the above was written, and the map it refers to\r\nwas returned to me from the engraver, I have discovered that a similar\r\nattempt to identify the ancient names of Ptolemy with those now attached\r\nto the supposed localities, was made by Gosselin; and a chart so\r\nconstructed will be found (No. xiv.) appended to his _Recherches sur la\r\nGéographie des Anciens_, t. iii. p. 303. I have been gratified to find\r\nthat in the more important points we agree; but in many of the minor\r\nones, the want of personal knowledge of the island involved Gosselin in\r\nerrors which the map I have prepared will, I hope, serve to\r\nrectify.--J.E.T.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  TAPROBANE OR SALIKE,\r\n  _(CEYLON)\r\n  according to_\r\n  Ptolemy and Pliny.\r\n\r\n  _N.B.

Emerson Tennent._]\r\n\r\nThe extent and accuracy of Ptolemy's information is so surprising, that\r\nit has given rise to surmises as to the sources whence it could possibly\r\nhave been derived.[1] But the conjecture that he was indebted to ancient\r\nPhoenician or Tyrian authorities whom he has failed to acknowledge, is\r\nsufficiently met by the consideration that these were equally accessible\r\nto his predecessors. The abundance of his materials, especially those\r\nrelating to the sea-borde of India and Ceylon, is sufficient to show\r\nthat he was mainly indebted for his facts to the adventurous merchants\r\nof Egypt and Arabia, and to works which, like the _Periplus of the\r\nErythroean Sea_ (erroneously ascribed to ARRIAN the historian, but\r\nwritten by a merchant probably of the same name), were drawn up by\r\npractical navigators to serve as sailing directions for seamen resorting\r\nto the Indian Ocean.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: HEEREN, _Hist. Researches_, vol. ii. Appendix xii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: LASSEN, _De Taprob. Ins._ p. 4. From the error of Ptolemy\r\nin making the coast of Malabar extend from west to east, whilst its true\r\nposition is laid down in the _Periplus_, VINCENT concludes that he was\r\nnot acquainted with the _Periplus_, as, anterior to the invention of\r\nprinting, cotemporaries might readily be ignorant of the productions of\r\neach other (VINCENT, vol. ii. p. 55). Vincent assigns the composition of\r\nthe _Periplus_ to the reign of Claudius or Nero, and Dodwell to that of\r\nM. Aurelius, but Letronne more judiciously ascribes it to the period of\r\nSeverus and Caracalla, A.D. 198,210, fifty years later than Ptolemy. The\r\nauthor, a Greek of Alexandria and a merchant, never visited Ceylon,\r\nthough he had been as far south as Nelkynda (the modern Neliseram), and\r\nthe account which he gives from report of the island is meagre, and in\r\nsome respects erroneous. ARRIANI _Periplus Maris Eryth.;_ HUDSON, vol.\r\ni. p. 35; VINCENT, vol. ii. p. 493.]\r\n\r\nSo ample was the description of Ceylon afforded by Ptolemy, that for a\r\nvery long period his successors, AGATHEMERUS, MARCIANUS of Heraclea, and\r\nother geographers, were severally contented to use the facts originally\r\ncollected by him.[1] And it was not till the reign of Justinian, in the\r\nsixth century, that COSMAS INDICO-PLEUSTES, by publishing the narrative\r\nof Sopater, added very considerably to the previous knowledge of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: AGATHEMERUS, _Hudson Geog._, l. ii. c. 7,8.; MARCIANUS\r\nHERACLEOTA, _Periplus, Hudson,_ p. 26. STEPHANUS BYZANTINUS, _in verbo_\r\n\"Taprobane.\" Instead of the expression of PTOLEMY that Taprobane [Greek:\r\nekaleito palai Simoundon], which MARCIANUS had rendered [Greek:\r\nPalaisimioundou], STEPHANUS transposes the words as if to guard against\r\nerror, [Greek: palai men ekaleito Simoundou], &c. The prior authority\r\nof PTOLEMY, however, serves to prolong the mystery, as he calls the\r\ncapital Palæsimundum.]\r\n\r\nAs Cosmos is the last Greek writer who treats of Taprobane[1], it may be\r\ninteresting, before passing to his account of the island, to advert to\r\nwhat has been recorded by the Singhalese chroniclers themselves, as to\r\nits actual condition at the period when Cosmas described it, and thus to\r\nverify his narrative by the test of historical evidence. It has been\r\nshown in another chapter that between the first and the sixth centuries,\r\nCeylon had undergone all the miseries of frequent invasions: that in the\r\nvicissitudes of time the great dynasty of Wijayo had expired, and the\r\nthrone had fallen into the hands of an effeminate and powerless race,\r\nutterly unable to contend with the energetic Malabars, who acquired an\r\nestablished footing in the northern parts of the island. The south, too\r\nwild and uncultivated to attract these restless plunderers, and too\r\nrugged and inaccessible to be overrun by them, was divided into a number\r\nof petty principalities, whose kings did homage to the paramount\r\nsovereign north of the Mahawelli-ganga. Buddhism was the national\r\nreligion, but toleration was shown to all others,--to the worship of the\r\nBrahmans as well as to the barbarous superstition of the aboriginal\r\ntribes. At the same time, the productive wealth of the island had been\r\ndeveloped to an extraordinary extent by the care of successive kings,\r\nand by innumerable works for irrigation and agriculture provided by\r\ntheir policy. Anarajapoora, the capital, had expanded into extraordinary\r\ndimensions, it was adorned with buildings and monuments, surpassing in\r\nmagnitude those of any city in India, and had already attracted pilgrims\r\nand travellers from China and the uttermost countries of the East.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There is another curious work which, notwithstanding\r\ncertain doubts as to its authorship, contains internal evidence\r\nentitling it, in point of time, to take precedence of COSMAS. This is\r\nthe tract \"_De Moribus Brachmanorum_\", ascribed to St. Ambrose, and\r\nwhich under the title [Greek: \"Peri tôn têz Indiaz kai tôn Brachmanôn\"]\r\nhas been also attributed to Palladius, but in all probability it was\r\nactually the composition of neither. Early in the fifth century\r\nPalladius was Bishop of Helenopolis, in Bithynia, and died about A.D.\r\n410. He spent a part of his life in Coptic monasteries, and it is\r\npossible that during his sojourn in Egypt, meeting travellers and\r\nmerchants returning from India, he may have caused this narrative to be\r\ntaken down from the dictation of one of them. Cave hesitates to believe\r\nthat it was written by PALLADIUS, \"haud facile credem,\" &c. (_Script.\r\nEccles. Hist. Lit._); and the learned Benedictine editors of AMBROSE\r\nhave excluded it from the works of the latter. They could scarcely have\r\ndone otherwise when the first chapter of the Latin version opens with\r\nthe declaration that it was drawn up by its author at the request of\r\n\"PALLADIUS.\" \"Desiderium mentis tuæ Palladi opus efficere nos\r\ncompellit,\" &c. Neither of the two versions can be accepted as a\r\ntranslation of the other, but the discrepancies are not inconsistent,\r\nand would countenance the conjecture that the book is the production of\r\none and the same person. Much of the material is borrowed from PTOLEMY\r\nand PLINY but the facts which are new could only have been collected by\r\npersons who had visited the scenes they describe. The compiler says he\r\nhad learned from a certain scholar of Thebes that the inhabitants of\r\nCeylon were called _Macrobii_, because, owing to the salubrity of the\r\nclimate, the average duration of life was 150 years. The petty kings of\r\nthe country acknowledged one paramount sovereign to whom they were\r\nsubject as satraps; this the Theban was told by others, as he himself\r\nnot allowed to visit the interior. A thousand other islands lie adjacent\r\nto Ceylon, and in a group of these which he calls Maniolæ (probably the\r\nAttols of the Maldives,) is found the loadstone, which attracts iron, so\r\nthat a vessel coming within its influence, is seized and forcibly\r\ndetained, and for this reason the ships which navigate these seas are\r\nfastened with pegs of wood instead of bolts of iron.\r\n\r\nCeylon, according to this traveller, has five large and navigable\r\nrivers, it rejoices in one perennial harvest, and the flowers and the\r\nripe fruit hang together on the same branch. There are palm trees; both\r\nthose that bear the great Indian nut, and the smaller aromatic one (the\r\nareka). The natives subsist on milk, rice, and fruit. The sheep produce\r\nno wool, but have long and silky hair, and linen being unknown, the\r\ninhabitants clothe themselves in skins, which are far from inelegantly\r\nworked.\r\n\r\nFinding some Indian merchants there who had come in a small vessel to\r\ntrade, the Theban attempted to go into the interior, and succeeded in\r\ngetting sight of a tribe whom he calls Besadæ or Vesadæ, his description\r\nof whom is in singular conformity with the actual condition of the\r\nVeddahs in Ceylon at the present day. \"They are,\" he says, \"a feeble and\r\ndiminutive race, dwelling in caves under the rocks, and early accustomed\r\nto ascend precipices, with which their country abounds, in order to\r\ngather pepper from the climbing plants. They are of low stature, with\r\nlarge heads and shaggy uncut hair.\"\r\n\r\nThe Theban proceeds to relate that being arrested by one of the chiefs,\r\non the charge of having entered his territory without permission, he was\r\nforcibly detained there for six years, subsisting on a measure of food,\r\nissued to him daily by the royal authority. This again presents a\r\ncurious coincidence with the detention and treatment of Knox and other\r\ncaptives by the kings of Kandy in modern times. He was at last released\r\nowing to the breaking out of hostilities between the chief who held him\r\nprisoner and another prince, who accused the former before the supreme\r\nsovereign of having unlawfully detained a Roman citizen, after which he\r\nwas set at liberty, out of respect to the Roman name and authority.\r\n\r\nThis curious tract was first published by CAMERABIUS, but in 1665 Sir\r\nEDWARD BISSE, Baronet, and Clarenceux King-at-Arms, reproduced the Greek\r\noriginal, supposing it to be an unpublished manuscript, with a Latin\r\ntranslation. It is incorporated in one of the MSS. of the\r\n_Pseudo-Callisthenes_ recently edited by MÜLLER, lib. iii. ch. vii.\r\nviii.; DIDOT. _Script Groec. Bib_., vol. xxvi. Paris, 1846.]\r\n\r\nWith the increasing commercial intercourse between the West and the\r\nEast, Ceylon, from its central position, half way between Arabia and\r\nChina, had during the same period risen into signal importance as a\r\ngreat emporium for foreign trade. The transfer of the seat of empire\r\nfrom Rome to Constantinople served to revive the over-land traffic with\r\nIndia; and the Persians for the first time[1] vied with the Arabs and\r\nthe merchants of Egypt, and sought to divert the Oriental trade from the\r\nRed Sea and Alexandria to the Euphrates and the Tigris.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: GIBBON, ch. xl.; ROBERTSON'S _India_, b.i.]\r\n\r\nAlready, between the first and fifth centuries, the course of that trade\r\nhad undergone a considerable change. In its infancy, and so long as the\r\nnavigation was confined to coasting adventures, the fleets of the\r\nPtolemies sailed no further than to the ports of Arabia Felx[1], where\r\nthey were met by Arabian vessels returning from the west coast of India,\r\nbringing thence the productions of China, shipped at the emporiums of\r\nMalabar. After the discovery of the monsoons, and the accomplishment of\r\nbolder voyages, the great entrepôt of commerce was removed farther\r\nsouth; first, from Muziris, the modern Mangalore, to Nelkynda, now\r\nNeliseram, and afterwards to Calicut and Coulam, or Quilon. In like\r\nmanner the Chinese, who, whilst the navigation of the Arabs and Persians\r\nwas in its infancy, had extended their voyages not only to Malabar but\r\nto the Persian Gulf, gradually contracted them as their correspondents\r\nventured further south. HAMZA says, that in the fifth century the\r\nEuphrates was navigable as high as Hira, within a few miles of\r\nBabylon[2]; and MASSOUDI, in his _Meadows of Gold_, states that at that\r\ntime the Chinese ships ascended the river and anchored in front of the\r\nhouses there.[3] At a later period, their utmost limit was Syraf, in\r\nFarsistan[4]; they afterwards halted first at Muziris, next at\r\nCalicut[5], then at Coulam, now Quilon[6]; and eventually, in the fourth\r\nand fifth centuries, the Chinese vessels appear rarely to have sailed\r\nfurther west than Ceylon. Thither they came with their silks and other\r\ncommodities, those destined for Europe being chiefly paid for in\r\nsilver[7], and those intended for barter in India were trans-shipped\r\ninto smaller craft, adapted to the Indian seas, by which they were\r\ndistributed at the various ports east and west of Cape Comorin.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Aden was a Roman emporium; [Greek: Rhomaikon emporion\r\nAdanên].--PHILOSTORGIUS, p. 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: HAZMA ISPAHANENSIS, p. 102; REINAUD, _Relation, &c._, vol.\r\ni. p. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: MASSOUDI, _Meadows of Gold_, Transl. of SPRENGER, vol. i.\r\np. 246.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: ABOU-ZEYD, vol. i. p, 14; REINAUD _Discours_, pp. 44, 78.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: DULAURIER, _Journ.

Periplus of the Erythrean\r\nSea describes these Ceylon crafts as rigged vessels, [Greek:\r\nhistiopepoiêmenois nêusi].]\r\n\r\nCOSMAS was a merchant of Egypt in the reign of Justinian, who, from the\r\nextent of his travels, acquired the title of \"Indico-pleustes.\" Retiring\r\nto the cloister, he devoted the remnant of his life to the preparation\r\nof a work in defence of the cosmography of the Pentateuch from the\r\nerrors of the Ptolemaic astronomy.[1] He died in the year 550, before\r\nhis task was completed, and one of the last portions on which he was\r\nemployed was an account of Taprobane, taken down from the reports of\r\nSopater, a Greek trader whom he had met at Adule in Ethiopia, when on\r\nhis return from Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: [Greek: Christianikê Topographia], sive _Christianorum\r\nOpinio de Mundo_. This curious book has been printed entire by\r\nMontfaucon from a MS. in the Vatican Coll. Patr., vol. ii. p. 333.\r\nParis, 1706 A.D. There is only one other MS. known, which was in\r\nFlorence; and from it THEVENOT had previously extracted and published\r\nthe portion relating to India in his _Relation des Dic. Voy_., vol. i.\r\nParis, 1576 A.D.]\r\n\r\nSopater, in the course of business as a merchant, sailed from Adule in\r\nthe same ship with a Persian bound for Ceylon, and on his arrival he and\r\nhis fellow-traveller were presented by the officers of the port to the\r\nking, who was probably Kumara Das, the friend and patron of the poet\r\nKalidas.[1] The king received them with courtesy, and Cosmas recounts\r\nhow in the course of the interview Sopater succeeded in convincing the\r\nSinghalese monarch of the greater power of Rome as compared with that of\r\nPersia, by exhibiting the large and highly finished gold coin of the\r\nRoman Emperor in contrast with the small and inelegant silver money of\r\nthe Shah. This story would, however, appear to be traditional, as Pliny\r\nrelates a somewhat similar anecdote of the ambassadors from Ceylon in\r\nthe reign of Claudius, and of the profound respect excited in their\r\nminds by the sight of the Roman denarii.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Cosmas wrote between A.D. 545 and 550; and the voyage of\r\nSopater to Ceylon had been made thirty years before. Kumaara Das reigned\r\nfrom A.D. 515 to A.D. 524. Vincent has noted the fact that in his\r\ninterview with the Greek he addressed him by the epithet of Roomi,\r\n\"[Greek: su Rômeu],\" which is the term that has been applied from time\r\nimmemorial in India to the powers who have been successively in\r\npossession of Constantinople, whether Roman, Christian, or Mahommedan.\r\nVol. ii. p. 511, &c.]\r\n\r\nAs Sopater was the first traveller who described Ceylon from personal\r\nknowledge, I shall give his account of the island in the words of\r\nCosmas, which have not before been presented in an English translation.\r\n\"It is,\" he says, \"a great island of the ocean lying in the Indian Sea,\r\ncalled Sielendib by the Indians, but Taprobane by the Greeks. The stone,\r\nthe hyacinth, is found in it; it lies beyond the pepper country.[1]\r\nAround it there are a multitude of exceedingly small islets[2], all\r\ncontaining fresh water and coco-nut palms[3]; these (islands) lie as\r\nclose as possible together. The great island itself, according to the\r\naccounts of its inhabitants, is 300 _gaudia_[4], or 900 miles long, and\r\nas many in breadth. There are two kings ruling at opposite ends of the\r\nisland[5], one of whom possesses the hyacinth[6], and the other the\r\ndistrict, in which are the port and emporium[7], for the emporium in\r\nthat place is the greatest in those parts.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Malabar or Narghyl Arabia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Maldive Islands.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: [Greek: Argellia] pro [Greek: nargellia], from _narikela_,\r\nthe Sanskrit, and _narghyl_, Arab, for the \"coco-nut palm.\" GILDEMESTER,\r\n_Script. Arab_. p. 36.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"[Greek: Gaudia.\"] It is very remarkable that this singular\r\nword _gaou_, in which Cosmas gives the dimensions of the island, is in\r\nuse to the present day in Ceylon, and means the distance which a man can\r\nwalk in an hour. VINCENT, in his _Commerce and Navigation of the\r\nAncients_, has noticed this passage (vol. ii, p. 506), and sayt,\r\nsomewhat loosely, that the Singhalese _gaou_, which he spells \"_ghadia_\"\r\nis the same as the _naligiae_ of the Tamils, and equal to three-eighths\r\nof a French league, or nearly one mile and a quarter English. This is\r\nincorrect; a _gaou_ in Ceylon expresses a somewhat indeterminate length,\r\naccording to the nature of the ground to be traversed, a gaou across a\r\nmountainous country being less than one measured on level ground, and a\r\ngaou for a loaded cooley is also permitted to be shorter than for one\r\nunburthened, but on the whole the average may be taken _under four\r\nmiles_. This is worth remarking, because it brings the statement made to\r\nSopater by the Singhalese in the sixth century into consistency with the\r\nrepresentations of the ambassadors to the Emperor Claudius in the first,\r\nalthough both prove to be erroneous. It is curious that FA HIAN, the\r\nChinese traveller, whose zeal for Buddhism led him to visit India and\r\nCeylon a century and a half before Cosmas, gives an area to the island\r\nwhich approaches very nearly to correctness; although he reverses the\r\ndirection in which its length exceeds its breadth. _Fo[)e]-kou[)e]-ki_,\r\nc. xxxvii. p. 328.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: [Greek: \"Enantioiallêlôn\"]. This may also mean \"at war with\r\none another.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: This has been translated so as to mean the portion of the\r\nisland producing hyacinth stones (\"la partie de l'isle où se trouvent\r\nles jacinthes.\" THEVENOT). But besides that I know of no Greek form of\r\nexpression that admits of such expansion; this construction, if\r\naccepted, would be inconsistent with fact--for the king alluded to held\r\nthe north of the island, whereas the region producing gems is the south,\r\nand in it were also the \"emporium,\" and the harbour frequented by\r\nshipping and merchants. I am disposed therefore to accept the term in\r\nits simple sense, and to believe that it refers to one particular jewel,\r\nfor the possession of which the king of Ceylon enjoyed an enviable\r\nrenown. Cosmas, in the succeeding sentence, describes this wonderful gem\r\nas being deposited in a temple near the capital; and Hiouen Thsang, the\r\nChinese pilgrim, says that in the seventh century, a ruby was elevated\r\non a spire surmounting a temple at Anarajapoora \"dont l'éclat magnifique\r\nillumine tout le ciel.\"--_Vie de Hiouen Thsang_, lib. iv. p. 199;\r\n_Voyages des Pélerins Bouddhistes_, lib. xi. v. ii. p. 141. MARCO POLO,\r\nin the thirteenth, century, says the \"king of Ceylon is reputed to have\r\nthe grandest ruby that was ever seen, a span in length, the thickness of\r\na man's arm; brilliant beyond description, and without a single flaw. It\r\nhas the appearance of a glowing fire, and its worth cannot be estimated\r\nin money. The Grand Khan Kublai sent ambassadors to this monarch to\r\noffer for it the value of a city, but he would not part with it for all\r\nthe treasures of the world, as it was a jewel _handed down by his\r\nancestors on the throne_.\"--_Trans_. MARSDEN, 4to. 1818. It is most\r\nprobable that the stone described by Marco Polo was not a ruby, but an\r\namethyst, which is found in large crystals in Ceylon, and which modern\r\nmineralogists believe to be the \"hyacinth\" of the ancients. (DANA'S\r\n_Mineralogy_, vol. ii. p. 196.) CORSALI says it was a carbuncle\r\n(Ramusio, vol. i. p. 180); and JORDAN DE SEVERAC, about the year 1323,\r\nrepeats the story of its being a ruby so large that it could not be\r\ngrasped in the closed hand. (_Recueil de Voy_., Soc. Geog. Paris. vol.\r\niv. p. 50.) If this resplendent object really exhibited the dimensions\r\nassigned to it, the probability is that it was not a gem at all, but one\r\nof those counterfeits of glass, in producing which STRABO relates that\r\nthe artists of Alexandria attained the highest possible perfection (1.\r\nxvi. c. 2. sec. 25). Its luminosity by night is of course a fiction,\r\nunless, indeed, like the emerald pillar in the temple of Hercules at\r\nTyre, which HERODOTUS describes as \"shining brightly by night,\" it was a\r\nhollow cylinder into which a lamp could be introduced. _Herod_, ii. 44.\r\n\r\nOf the ultimate history of this renowned jewel we have no authentic\r\nnarrative; but it is stated in the Chinese accounts of Ceylon that early\r\nin the fourteenth century an officer was sent by the emperor to purchase\r\na \"carbuncle\" of unusual lustre. \"This served as the ball on the\r\nemperor's cap, and was transmitted to succeeding emperors on their\r\naccession as a precious heirloom, and worn on the birthday and at the\r\ngrand courts held on the first day of the year. It was upwards of an\r\nounce in weight, and cost 100,000 strings of cash. Every time a grand\r\nlevee was held during the darkness of the night, the red lustre filled\r\nthe palace, and it was for this reason designated 'The Red\r\nPalace-Illuminator.'\"--_Tsih-ke_, or _Miscellaneous Record_, quoted in\r\nthe _Kih che-king-yuen, Mirror of Science_, b. xxxiii. p. 1, 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The port and harbour of Point de Galle.]\r\n\r\n\"The island has also a community of Christians[1], chiefly resident\r\nPersians, with a presbyter ordained in Persia, a deacon, and a complete\r\necclesiastical ritual.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Nestorians, whose \"Catholicos\" resided first at Ctesiphon,\r\nand afterwards at Mosul. VINCENT, _Periplus_, &c., vol. ii, p. 507. For\r\nan examination of the hypotheses based on this statement of Cosmas, see\r\nSir J. EMERSON TENNENT'S _History of Christianity in Ceylon_, ch. i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: [Greek: \"Leitourgiat,\"] literally _liturgy_; which meant\r\noriginally the pomp and ceremonial of worship as well as the form of\r\nprayer.]\r\n\r\n\"The natives and their kings are of different races.[1] The temples are\r\nnumerous, and in one in particular, situated on an eminence[2], is the\r\ngreat hyacinth, as large as a pine-cone, the colour of fire, and\r\nflashing from a distance, especially when catching the beams of the\r\nsun--a matchless sight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: [Greek: Allophuloi].]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Probably that at Mihintala, the sacred hill near\r\nAnarajapoora.]\r\n\r\n\"As its position is central, the island is the resort of ships from all\r\nparts of India, Persia, and Ethiopia, and, in like manner, many are\r\ndespatched from it. From the inner[1] countries; I mean China, and other\r\nemporiums, it receives silk[2], aloes, cloves, clove-wood,\r\n_chandana_[3], and whatever else they produce. These it again transmits\r\nto the outer ports[4],--I mean to Male[5], whence the pepper comes; to\r\nCalliana[6], where there is brass and sesamine-wood, and materials for\r\ndress (for it is also a place of great trade), and to Sindon[7], where\r\nthey get musk, castor, and _androstachum_[8], to Persia, the Homeritic\r\ncoasts[9], and Adule. Receiving in return the exports of those\r\nemporiums, Taprobane exchanges them in the inner ports (to the east of\r\nCape Comorin) sending her own produce along with them to each.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: [Greek: \"tôn endoterôn,\"] the countries inside (that is to\r\nthe east) of Cape Comorin, as distinguished from the outer ports\r\n([Greek: ta exôtera]) mentioned below, which lie west of it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: [Greek: \"metaxin.\"] Of this foreign word, applied by the\r\nmediæval Greeks to silk in general, as well as to raw silk, PROCOPIUS\r\nsays:--[Greek: \"Ahutê de estin hê metaxa, ex hês eiothasi tên esthêta\r\nergazesthai, hên palai men Hellênes mêdikên, tanun de sêrikên\r\nonomazousi.\"]--PROCOP. _Persic._ I. _Metaxa_, or anciently _mataxa_,\r\n\"thread,\" \"yarn,\" seems to be Latine rather than Greek.

The most remarkable exports\r\nwere elephants, which from their size and sagacity were found to be\r\nsuperior to those of India for purposes of war. Hence the renown\r\naccorded to Ceylon, as pre-eminently the birthplace of the Asiatic race\r\nof elephants.\r\n\r\n[Greek:\r\n\r\n  \"Mêtera Taprobanên Asiêgeneôn elephantôn.\"]\r\n\r\n  DIONYSIUS PERIEGETES, v. 593.\r\n\r\nCosmas observes upon the smallness of their tusks compared with those of\r\nAfrica, and mentions the strange fact, that ivory was then exported from\r\nEthiopia to India, as well as to Persia and the countries of Europe. He\r\nmakes other allusions to Ceylon, but the passages extracted above,\r\npresent the bulk of his information concerning the island.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The above translation has been made from THEVENOT's version\r\nof Cosmas, which may differ slightly from that of MONTFAUCON, _Collect.\r\nNov. Patrum._ Paris, 1706, vol. ii. p.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE (A).\r\n\r\n_Knowledge of Ceylon possessed by the Phoenicians._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapter, p. 526, &c., allusion has been made to the\r\npossible resort of the Phoenicians to Ceylon in the course of their\r\nvoyages to India, but I have not thought it expedient to embody in the\r\ntext any notice of the description of the island which is given in the\r\nPhoenician History of SANCHONIATHON, published by Wagenfeld, at Bremen,\r\nin 1837, under the title of \"_Sanchuniathonis Historiarum Phoeniciæ\r\nLibri Novem Groece Versos a Philone Byblio_, edidit Latinaque Versione\r\ndonavit F. WAGENFELD.\"\r\n\r\nSanchoniathon is alleged to have lived before the Trojan war; and in\r\nAsiatic chronology he is said to have been a contemporary of Semiramis.\r\nThe Phoenician original perished; but its contents were preserved in the\r\nGreek translation of Philo, a native of Byblus, a frontier town of\r\nPhoenicia, who wrote in the first century after Christ, and till the\r\nalleged discovery of the MS. from which Wagenfeld professed to publish,\r\nthe only portion of Philo's version known to exist consisted of\r\nfragments preserved by Eusebius and Porphyry. Wagenfeld's statement was,\r\nthat the MS. in his possession had been obtained from the Portuguese\r\nmonastery of St. Maria de Merinhao (the existence of which there is\r\nreason to doubt), and the portion which he first ventured to print\r\nappeared with a preface by Grotefend. Its genuineness was instantly\r\nimpugned; a learned and protracted controversy arose; and though\r\nWagenfeld eventually published the whole of the Greek MS., with a Latin\r\nversion by himself, he was never prevailed upon to exhibit the original\r\nparchments, alleging that he had been compelled to restore them to the\r\nconvent. The assailants of Wagenfeld accuse him of wilful deception; but\r\nthe probability is that the document which he translated is one of those\r\ninventions of the Middle Ages, in which history and geography were\r\nstrangely confounded with imagination and romance; and that it is an\r\nattempt to restore the lost books of Philo Byblius, as Philo himself is\r\nmore than suspected to have invented the history which he professed to\r\nhave translated from Sanchoniathon. (See ERSCH _and_ GRÜBER'S\r\n_Encyclopædia_, 1847; MÖVER'S _Phoenician History_, vol. i. p. 117.)\r\n\r\n[336. In point of time, the notice of Ceylon given by the Armenian\r\nArchbishop Moses of Chorene in his _Historia Armeniaca et Epitome\r\nGeographiæ_, is entitled to precede that of Cosmos Indico-pleustes,\r\ninasmuch as Moses has translated into Armenian the Greek text of Pappus\r\nof Alexandria, who wrote about the end of the fourth century. Of\r\nTaprobane he says--it is one of the largest islands in the world, being\r\n1100 miles in length by 1500 broad, and reckons 1370 adjacent islands\r\namongst its dependencies. He alludes to its mountains and rivers, the\r\nvariety of races which inhabit it, and its production of gold, silver,\r\ngems, spices, elephants, and tigers; and dwells on the fact, previously\r\nnoticed by Agathemerus, that the men of this country dress their hair\r\nafter the fashion of women, by braiding it in tresses on the top of\r\ntheir heads, \"viri regionis istius capillis muliebribus sua capita\r\nredimiunt.\"--MOSES CHORENENSIS, &c., edit. Whiston, 1736, p. 367. The\r\nmost remarkable circumstance is that he alludes thus early to the\r\nfootprint on Adam's Peak, which is probably the meaning of his\r\nexpression, \"_ibidem Satanæ lapsum narrant_,\" t. iv.]\r\n\r\nIn books vii. and viii, Sanchoniathon gives an account of an island in\r\nthe Indian seas explored by Tyrian navigators, the description of which\r\nis evidently copied from the early Greek writers who had visited\r\nTaprobane, and the name which is assigned to it, \"_the Island of\r\nRachius_\", is borrowed from Pliny. The period of their visit is fixed by\r\nSanchoniathon shortly after the conquest of Cittium, in Cyprus, by the\r\nPhoenicians; an event which occurred when Hiram reigned at Tyre, and\r\nSolomon at Jerusalem. The narrative is given as follows (book vii. ch.\r\nv. p. 150): \"So Bartophas died the next day, having exercised imperial\r\nauthority for six years.\" (Ch. v.) \"And on his death they chose Joramus,\r\nthe son of Bartophas, king, whom the Tyrians styled Hierbas, and who\r\nreigned fifty-seven years. He having collected seventy-nine long ships,\r\nsent an expedition against Cittium.\" ... (Ch. vi.) \"At this time,\r\nObdalius, king of the island of Mylite, sent all his forces to assist\r\nthe Tyrians at Cittium; and when it came to the knowledge of the\r\nbarbarians who inhabited Tenga, that the island was denuded of men and\r\nships, they invaded it under the command of Plusiacon, the son-in-law of\r\nObdalius, and having slain him and many of his people, they plundered\r\nthe country, and gave the city to the flames.\" (Ch. vii.) \"And Joramus\r\ndirected all the eparchs in the cities and islands to make out and send\r\nto Tyre descriptions of the inhabitants, their ships, their arms, their\r\nhorses, their scythe-bearing chariots, and their property of all kinds;\r\nand he ordered them to send to distant countries persons competent to\r\ndraw up narratives of the same kind, and to record them all in a book.\r\nIn this manner he obtained accurate geographical descriptions of all the\r\nregions to the east and the west, both islands and inland parts. But the\r\nÆthiopians[1] represented to the king that to the south there were great\r\nand renowned countries, densely populated, and rich in precious things,\r\n_gold_ and _silver_, pearls, gems, ebony, pepper, elephants, _monkeys_,\r\nparrots, _peacocks_, and innumerable other things; and that there was a\r\npeninsula so far to the east that the inhabitants could see the sun\r\nrising out of the sea.\" (Ch. viii.) \"Joramus then sent messengers to\r\nNatambalus, the king of the Babylonians, who were to say to him, 'I have\r\nheard that the countries of the Æthiopians are numerous, and abounding\r\nin inhabitants; they are easy of access from Babylon, but very difficult\r\nfrom Tyre. If, therefore, I should determine to explore them, and you\r\nwill let my subjects have suitable ships, you shall have in return a\r\nhundred purple cloaks.' Natambalus was willing to do so; but the\r\nÆthiopian merchants, who resorted to Babylon, vowed that they would take\r\ntheir departure if he should assist Joramus to sail to Æthiopia.\" (Chap.\r\nix.) \"Subsequently Joramus addressed himself to Irenius of Judea, and\r\nundertook that if he would let the Tyrians have a harbour on the sea\r\ntowards Æthiopia, he would assist him in the building of a palace, in\r\nwhich he was then engaged; and bind himself to supply him with materials\r\nof cedar and fir, and squared stones. Irenius assenting, made over to\r\nJoramus the city and harbour of Ilotha. There were a great many date\r\ntrees there, but as their timber was not suitable for constructing\r\nvessels, Joramus despatched eight thousand camels to Ilotha, loaded with\r\nmaterials for ship-building, and ordered the shipwrights to build ten\r\nships, and he appointed Cedarus and Jaminus and Cotilus, commanders....\r\nThey sailed from Ilotha; but furious tempests prevented them from\r\npassing the straits.[2] And while they were wind-bound, they remained\r\nfive months in a certain island, and having sowed wheat on the low\r\nground, they reaped an abundant crop. After this they sailed towards the\r\nrising sun, and leaving the land of the Arabians they fell in with\r\nBabylonian ships returning from Æthiopia.[3] And on the following day\r\nthey arrived at the country of the Æthiopians, which they perceived\r\nsandy and devoid of water on the coast, but mountainous inland. They\r\nthen sailed eastward along the shore for ten days. There an immense\r\nregion extends to the south, and the Æthiopians dwell in numerous\r\npopulous and well-circumstanced cities, and navigate the sea. Their\r\nships are not suited for war, and have no sails. And having sailed\r\nthirty-six days to the southward, the Tyrians arrived at the island of\r\nRachius ([Greek: Rhachiou nêson]).\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Æthiopians alluded to were a company of Indian jugglers\r\nand snake-charmers, whose arrival from Babylon is mentioned lib. vii.\r\nch. i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Of Bab-el-mandeb.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: India.]\r\n\r\n(Ch. 9.) \"The roadstead was in front of a level strand, bordered with\r\nlofty trees, and coming on to blow at night, they were in the utmost\r\ndanger till sunrise: but running then to the south, they came in sight\r\nof a safe harbour[1]; and saw many populous towns inland. On landing,\r\nthey were surrounded by the villagers, and the governor of the place\r\nentertained them hospitably for seven days; pending the return of a\r\nmessenger whom he had despatched to the principal king, to ask his\r\ninstructions relative to the Tyrians who had anchored in the harbour.\r\nThe messenger having returned on the seventh day, the governor sent for\r\nthe Tyrians the following morning, and informed them that they must go\r\nwith him to the king, who was then residing at Rochapatta, a large and\r\nprosperous city in the centre of the island. In front marched several\r\nspearmen, sent by the king as a guard of honour to the strangers; who\r\nwith the clash of their spears scared away the elephants which were\r\nnumerous and dangerous because it was their rutting time. The Tyrians\r\nmarched in the centre, and Cedarus, Cotilus, and Jaminus were carried in\r\npalanquins. The villagers as they passed along offered them presents,\r\nand the governor brought up the rear, where he rode on an elephant,\r\nsurrounded by his body guard. In this order of march, they on the third\r\nday came to a ford; in the passage over which, one of the travellers was\r\ndevoured by crocodiles which swarm in the rivers. Having proceeded thus\r\nfor several days, they at length descried the city of Rochapatta,\r\nenvironed by lofty mountains. And when it was known that they had\r\narrived (for the rumour of their approach had preceded them) the\r\ninhabitants rushed from the city in a body to see the Tyrians; some\r\nriding on elephants, some on asses, some in palanquins, but the greater\r\npart on foot. And the commander having conducted them into a spacious\r\nand splendid palace, caused the gates to be closed, that the crowd might\r\nnot make their way in; and led the Tyrians to the King Rachius, who was\r\nseated on a beautiful couch. Presents were then interchanged.\r\n\r\n\"To the Tyrians, who brought horses and purple robes, and seats of cedar,\r\nthe King gave in return, pearls, gold, 2000 elephants' teeth, and much\r\nunequalled cinnamon ([Greek: kinnamô pollô te kai diapheronti]); and he\r\nentertained them as guests for thirty days.\" (Ch. xi.) \"Some of the\r\nTyrians perished in the island, one indeed by sickness, but the others\r\nsmitten by the gods. One man, picking up some pellets of sheep's dung,\r\ndrew lines on the sand, and challenged another who happened to be\r\nlooking on, to play a game with them. The challenger held the sheep's\r\ndung, but the other, who could not find any dung of camels (for there\r\nare no camels in that island), took cow-dung, of which there was a great\r\nquantity, and rolling up little balls of it, placed them on the lines.\r\nBut a priest who was present warned them to desist, because cow-dung is\r\nsacred among them, but they only laughed. So the priest passed on, and\r\nthey continued their game, but shortly after, both fell down and\r\nexpired, to the consternation of the bystanders. One of those who died\r\nwas a native of Jerusalem.\" (Ch. xii.) \"The sea encircles this great\r\nisland of Rachius on every side, except that to the north and west there\r\nis _an isthmus which affords a passage to the opposite coast_. Baaut\r\nconstructed this place by heaping up mud, and her footprint is still to\r\nbe seen in the mountain ([Greek: ês kai ichnos estin en tois orois]).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Galle?]\r\n\r\n\"And the great king traced his descent from her race. The island is six\r\ndays' journey in breadth, and twelve days' journey in length. It is\r\npopulous and delightful. Its natural productions are magnificent, and\r\nthe sea furnishes fish of the finest flavour, and in the greatest\r\nabundance, to the inhabitants of the coast. Wild beasts are numerous in\r\nthe mountains, of which elephants are the largest of all. There is also\r\nthe most fragrant of cassia ([Greek: kasia de hê arômatikôtatê]).\r\n\r\n\"They find stones containing gold in the rivers, and pearls on the\r\nsea-shore. Four kings govern the island, all subordinate to the\r\nparamount sovereign, to whom they pay as tribute, cassia, ivory, gems,\r\nand pearls; for the king has gold in the greatest abundance. The first\r\nof these kings reigns in the south, where there are herds of elephants,\r\nof which great numbers are captured of surprising size. In this region\r\nthe shore is inhospitable, and destitute of inhabitants, but the city,\r\nin which the governor resides, lies inland, and is said to be large and\r\nflourishing. The second king governs the western regions which produce\r\ncinnamon ([Greek: tôn pros esperan tetrammenôn tôn kinnamômophorôn]);\r\nand it was there the Tyrian ships cast anchor. The third rules the\r\nregion towards the north, which produces pearls. He has made a great\r\nrampart on the isthmus to control the passage of the barbarians from the\r\nopposite coast; for they used to make incursions in great numbers, and\r\ndestroyed all the houses, temples, and plantations they could reach, and\r\nslew such men as were near, or could not flee to the mountains. The\r\nfourth king governs the region to the east, producing the richest gems\r\nin surprising profusion; the ruby, the sapphire, and diamond. All these,\r\nbeing the brothers of the great king in Rochapatta, are appointed to\r\nrule over these places, and he who is the eldest of the brothers has the\r\nsupreme power, and is called the chief and mighty ruler. He has a\r\nthousand black elephants, and five light-coloured ones. The black are\r\nabundant, but the fair-coloured are rare, and found nowhere except in\r\nthis island, and the black ones do homage to them. Having captured such\r\na one, they bring him to the king in Rochapatta, whose peculiar\r\nprerogative it is to ride on a white elephant, this being unlawful for\r\nhis subjects. There are many fierce crocodiles in the rivers, and they\r\nare killed by crowds of men who rush with shouts into the water, armed\r\nwith sharp stakes. And ten days after they arrived in Rochapatta, many\r\nTyrians joined Rachius in hunting crocodiles.\" (Ch. xii.) \"When the\r\nships returned to Tyre, Joramus gave orders to erect a pillar at the\r\ntemple of Melicarthus, and to engrave on it an account of all that had\r\ntaken place. This pillar was thrown down in the earthquake of last year,\r\nbut it was not broken, so that the narrative can even now be seen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Ch. i) \"This is the voyage which Joramus, the king of the Tyrians\r\nordered Joramus, the priest of Melicarthus, to recount and to engrave on\r\na pillar in the temple of Melicarthus, and Sydyk, the scribe, having\r\nfour copies, was directed to send them to the Sidonians, the Byblians,\r\nthe Aradians, and the Berythians. The other copies can nowhere be found,\r\nand the pillar lies shattered in the ruins of the temple, but the copy\r\nof the Byblians is still left in the Temple of Baaltis, and its words\r\nare to this effect.\"\r\n\r\n(Ch. ii.) \"Hierbas, the son of Bartophas, and king of the Tyrians, thus\r\naddressed Joramus, the priest of Madynus, at the time when figs were\r\nfirst ripe: 'Taking a book and pen, describe all the cities and islands\r\nand colonies and the countries of the barbarians, and the forces of them\r\nall, and their ships of war and of burthen, and their scythe-armed\r\nchariots. For when our ships of war, sailing to the island of Rachius,\r\nreached the remotest parts eastward that we knew, the extremities of all\r\nlands, and the nations that inhabited them, we discovered things unknown\r\nto our ancestors. For our ancestors, sailing only to the islands and the\r\nregion extending to the west, knew nothing of the countries which we\r\nhave explored to the east: you will therefore write all these things for\r\nthe information of posterity.' When having prostrated myself before the\r\nking, on his saying these things, and having returned to my own house I\r\nwrote as follows:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(Ch. xvi) ... \"To the eastward dwell the Babylonians and Medians and\r\nÆthiopians. The city of the Babylonians is flourishing and populous;\r\nMedia produces white horses; Æthiopia is barren and arid near the sea,\r\nand mountainous in the interior. And further to the east is the\r\npeninsula of Rachius, whither the ships of Hierbas sailed.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn this narrative of Sanchoniathon it is only necessary to remark that\r\nthe allusion in ch. ix. to the assistance rendered by the Tyrians to\r\nIrenius of Judea, when building his palace, in supplying him with timber\r\nand squared stones, is almost literally copied from the passage In the\r\nOld Testament (1 Kings, ix. 11), where Hiram is stated to have furnished\r\nto Solomon \"cedar trees and fir trees,\" for the building of the Temple.\r\n\r\nThe cession by Irenius of the city and harbour of Ilotha refers to the\r\nresort of the Tyrians to Ezion Greber, or _Eloth_, in the Ælanitic Gulf\r\nof the Red Sea, Ib. v. 26, whence they piloted the ships of Solomon,\r\nwhich once in every three years returned with cargoes of gold from\r\nOphir. (Ib. v. 28.)\r\n\r\nAs to the incidents and observations recorded by the Phoenician\r\ntravellers during their journey to the interior of Ceylon,--the kings by\r\nwhich it was governed, the natural productions of the various regions,\r\nthe footprint on Adam's Peak, the incursions of the Malabars, the\r\nascendency of their religion, the absence of camels, the abundance of\r\nelephants, and the cultivation of cinnamon,--all these are so palpably\r\nimitated from the accounts of Cosmas Indico-pleustes, and the voyages of\r\nArabian mariners, that it is almost unnecessary to point to the parallel\r\npassages from which they are taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II\r\n\r\nINDIAN, ARABIAN, AND PERSIAN AUTHORITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn closing the volume of Cosmas, we part with the last of the Greek\r\nwriters whose pages guide us through the mist that obscures the early\r\nhistory of Ceylon. The religion of the Hindus is based on a system of\r\nphysical error, so incompatible with the extension of scientific truth,\r\nthat in their language the term \"geography\" is unknown.[1] But still it\r\nis remarkable as an illustration of the uninquiring character of the\r\npeople, that the allusions of Indian authors to Ceylon, an island of\r\nsuch magnitude, and so close to their own country, are pre-eminent for\r\nabsurdity and ignorance. Their \"Lanka\" and its inhabitants are but the\r\ndistortion of a reality into a myth. ALBYROUNI, the Arabian geographer,\r\nwriting in the eleventh century, says that the Hindus at that day\r\nthought the island haunted; their ships sailing past it, kept at a\r\ndistance from its shores; and even within the present century, it was\r\nthe popular belief on the continent of India that the interior of Ceylon\r\nwas peopled by demons and monkeys.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Arabians began the study so late, that they, too, had\r\nto borrow a word from the Greeks, whence their term \"_djagrafiya_.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: MOOR'S _Hindu Pantheon_, p. 318. MOOR speaks of an educated\r\nIndian gentleman who was attached as Munshi to the staff of Mr. North,\r\nGovernor of Ceylon, in 1804, and who, on his return to the continent,\r\nwrote a history of the island, in which he repeats the belief current\r\namong his countryment, that \"the interior was not inhabited by human\r\nbeings of the ordinary shapes.\"--P. 320.]\r\n\r\nBut the century in which Cosmos wrote witnessed the rise of a power\r\nwhose ascendant energy diffused a new character over the policy and\r\nliterature of the East. Scarcely twenty years elapsed between his death\r\nand the birth, of Mahomet--and during the two centuries that ensued, so\r\nelectric was the influence of Islam, that its supremacy was established\r\nwith a rapidity beyond parallel, from the sierras of Spain to the\r\nborders of China. The dominions of the Khalifs exceeded in extent the\r\nutmost empire of the Romans; and so undisputed was the sway of the new\r\nreligion, that a follower of the Prophet could travel amidst believers\r\nof his own faith, from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean, and from the\r\nchain of the Atlas to the mountains of Tartary.\r\n\r\nSyria and Egypt were amongst its earliest conquests; and the power thus\r\ninterposed between the Greeks and their former channels of trade,\r\neffectually excluded them from the commerce of India. The Persians and\r\nthe Arabs became its undisputed masters, and Alexandria and Seleucia\r\ndeclined in importance as Bassora and Bagdad rose to the rank of\r\nOriental emporiums.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: ROBERTSON was of opinion, that such was the aversion of the\r\nPersions to the sea, that \"no commercial intercourse took place between\r\nPersia and India.\"--_India_, s. i. p. 9. But this is at variance with\r\nthe testimony of COSMAS INDICO-PLEUSTES, as well as of HAMZA of Ispahan\r\nand others.]\r\n\r\nEarly in the sixth century, the Persians under Chosroes Nouschirvan held\r\na distinguished position in the East, their ships frequented the\r\nharbours of India, and their fleet was successful in an expedition\r\nagainst Ceylon to redress the wrongs done to some of their\r\nfellow-countrymen who had settled there for purposes of trade.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: HAMZA ISPAHANENSIS, _Annal_. vol. ii. c. 2. p. 43.\r\nPetropol, 1848, 8vo. REINAUD, _Mémoire sur l' Inde_, p. 124.]\r\n\r\nThe Arabs, who had been familiar with India before it was known to the\r\nGreeks,[1] and who had probably availed themselves of the monsoons long\r\nbefore Hippalus ventured to trust to them, began in the fourth and fifth\r\ncenturies to establish themselves as merchants at Cambay and Surat, at\r\nMangalore, Calicut, Coulam, and other Malabar ports[2], whence they\r\nmigrated to Ceylon, the government of which was remarkable for its\r\ntoleration of all religious sects[3], and its hospitable reception of\r\nfugitives.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There is an obscure sentence in PLINY which would seem to\r\nimply that the Arabs had settled in Ceylon before the first century of\r\nour Christian era:--\"Regi cultum Liberi patris, _coeteris\r\nArabum_.\"--Lib. vi. c. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: GILDEMEISTER; _Scriptores Arabi de Rebus Indicis_, p. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: EDRISI, tom. i p. 72.]\r\n\r\nIt is a curious circumstance, related by BELADORY, who lived at the\r\ncourt of the Khalif of Bagdad in the ninth century, that an outrage\r\ncommitted by Indian pirates upon some Mahometan ladies, the daughters of\r\ntraders who had died in Ceylon, and whose families the King\r\nDaloopiatissa II., A.D. 700, was sending to their homes in the valley of\r\nthe Tigris, served as the plea under which Hadjadj, the fanatical\r\ngovernor of Irak, directed the first Mahometan expedition for\r\nsubjugating the valley of the Indus.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The chief of the Indus was the Buddhist Prince Daher, whose\r\ncapital was at Daybal, near the modern Karachee. The story, as it\r\nappears in the MS. of Beladory in the library of Leyden, has been\r\nextracted by REINAUD in his _Fragmens Arabes et Persans relatifs á\r\nl'Inde_, No. v. p. 161, with the following translation:--\r\n\r\n\"Sous le gouvernement de Mohammed, le roi de l'ile du Rubis\r\n(Djezyret-Alyacout) offrit à Hadjadj des femmes musulmanes qui avaient\r\nreçu le jour dans ses états, et dont les pères, livrés à la profession\r\ndu commerce, étaient morts. Le prince esperuit par là gagner l'amitié de\r\nHadjadj; mais le navire où l'on avait embarqué ces femmes fut attaqué\r\npar une peuplade de race Meyd, des environs de Daybal, qui était montóe\r\nsur des burques. Les Meyds enlevèrent le navire avec ce qu'il\r\nrenfermait. Dans cette extrémité, une de ces femmes de la tribu de\r\nYarboua, s'écria: 'Que n'es-tu la, oh Hadjadj!' Cette nouvelle étant\r\nparvenue à Hadjadj, il répondit: 'Me voilà.' Aussitót il envoya un\r\ndépute à Dâher pour l'inviter à faire mettre ces femmes en liberté. Mais\r\nDâher répondit: 'Ce sont des pirates qui ont enlevé ces femmes, et je\r\nn'ai aucune autorité sur les ravisseurs.' Alors Hadjadj engagea Obeyd\r\nAllah, fils de Nabhan, à faire une expédition contre Daybal.\"--P. 190.\r\n\r\nThe \"Island of Rubies\" was the Persian name for Ceylon, and in this\r\nparticular instance FERISHTA confirms the identical application of these\r\ntwo names, vol. ii. p. 402. See _Journal Asiat_. vol. xlvi. p. 131, 163;\r\nREINAUD, _Mém. sur l'Inde_, p. 180; _Relation des Voyages_, Disc. p. xli\r\nABOULFEDA, _Introd_. vol. i. p. ccclxxxv.; ELPHINSTONE'S _India_, b. v.\r\nch. i, p. 260.]\r\n\r\nFrom the eighth till the eleventh century the Persians and Arabs\r\ncontinued to exercise the same influence over the opulent commerce of\r\nCeylon which was afterwards enjoyed by the Portuguese and Dutch in\r\nsuccession between A.D. 1505, and the expulsion of the latter by the\r\nBritish in A.D. 1796. During this early period, therefore, we must look\r\nfor the continuation of accounts regarding Ceylon to the literature of\r\nthe Arabs and the Persians, and more especially to the former, by whom\r\ngeography was first cultivated as a science in the eighth and ninth\r\ncenturies under the auspices of the Khalifs Almansour and Almamoun. On\r\nturning to the Arabian treatises on geography, it will be found that the\r\nMahometan writers on these subjects were for the most part grave and\r\nearnest men who, though liable equally with the imaginative Greeks to be\r\nimposed on by their informants, exercised somewhat more caution, and\r\nwere more disposed to confine their writings to statements of facts\r\nderived from safe authorities, or to matters which they had themselves\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nIn their hands scientific geography combined theoretic precision, which\r\nhad been introduced by their predecessors, with the extended observation\r\nincident to the victories and enlarged dominion of the Khalifs. Accurate\r\nknowledge was essential for the civil government of their conquests[1];\r\nand the pilgrimage to Mekka, indispensable once at least in the life of\r\nevery Mahometan[2], rendered the followers of the new faith acquainted\r\nwith many countries in addition to their own.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"La science géographique, comme les autres sciences en\r\ngénéral, notammement l'astronomie, commença à se former chez les Arabes,\r\ndans la dernière moitié du viii^{e} siècle, et se fixa dans la première\r\nmoitié du ix^{e}. On fit usage des itinéraires tracés par les chefs des\r\narmées conquérantes et des tableaux dressés par les gouveneurs de\r\nprovinces; en même temps on mit à la contribution les méthodes propagées\r\npar les Indians, les Persans, et surtout les Grees; qui avaient apporté\r\nle plus de précision dans leurs opérations.\"--REINAUD, _Introd.\r\nAboulfeda, &c.,_ p. xl.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: REINAUD, _Introd. Aboulfeda,_ p. cxxii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Ibid_., vol. i. p. xl.]\r\n\r\nHence the records of their voyages, though presenting numerous\r\nexaggerations and assertions altogether incredible, exhibit a\r\nsuperiority over the productions of the Greeks and Romans. To avoid the\r\nfault of dulness, both the latter were accustomed to enliven their\r\ntopographical itineraries, not so much by \"moving accidents,\" and\r\n\"hair-breadth 'scapes,\" as by mingling fanciful descriptions of monsters\r\nand natural phenomena, with romantic accounts of the gems and splendours\r\nof the East. Hence from CTESIAS to Sir JOHN MANDEVILLE, every early\r\ntraveller in India had his \"hint to speak,\" and each strove to embellish\r\nhis story by incorporating with the facts he had witnessed, improbable\r\nreports collected from the representations of others. Such were their\r\nexcesses in this direction, that the Greeks formed a class of\r\n\"paradoxical\" literature, by collecting into separate volumes the\r\nmarvels and wonders gravely related by their voyagers and historians.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Such are the _Mirabiles Auscultationes_ of ARISTOTLE, the\r\n_Incredibilia_ of PALEPHATES, the _Historiarum Mirabilium Collectio_ of\r\nANTIGONUS CARYSTIUS, the _Historiæ Mirabiles_ of APOLLONIUS THE MEAGRE,\r\nand the Collections of PHILEGON of Tralles, MICHAEL BELLUS, and many\r\nother Greeks of the Lower Empire. For a succinct account of these\r\ncompilers, see WESTERMAN'S _Hapre [Greek: doxographoi], Scriptores Rerum\r\nMirabilium Græci_ Brunswick, 1830.]\r\n\r\nThe Arabs, on the contrary, with sounder discretion, generally kept\r\ntheir \"travellers' histories\" distinct from their sober narratives, and\r\nwhilst the marvellous incidents related by adventurous seamen were\r\nreceived as materials for the story-tellers and romancers, the staple of\r\ntheir geographical works consisted of truthful descriptions of the\r\ncountries visited, their forms of government, their institutions, their\r\nproductions, and their trade.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of this matter-of-fact character of the Arab\r\ntopographers, the most familiar example is that known by the popular\r\ntitle of the _Voyages of the_ _two Mahometans[1]_, who travelled in\r\nIndia and China in the beginning of the ninth century. The book\r\nprofesses to give an account of the countries lying between Bassora and\r\nCanton; and in its unpretending style, and useful notices of commerce in\r\nthose seas, it resembles the record, which the merchant ARRIAN has left\r\nus in the _Periplus_, of the same trade as it existed seven centuries\r\npreviously, in the hands of the Greeks. The early portion of the book,\r\nwhich was written A.D. 851, was taken down, from the recital of\r\nSoleyman, a merchant who had frequently made the voyages he describes,\r\nat the epoch when the commerce of Bagdad, under the Khalifs, was at the\r\nheight of its prosperity. The second part was added sixty years later,\r\nby Abou-zeyd Hassan, an amateur geographer, of Bassora (contemporary\r\nwith Massoudi), from the reports of mariners returning from China, and\r\nis, to a great extent, an amplification of the notices supplied by\r\nSoleyman.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It was first published by RENAUDOT in 1718, and from the\r\nunique MS., now in the Bibliothèque impériale of Paris, and again by\r\nREINAUD in 1845, with a valuable discourse prefixed on the nature and\r\nextent of the Indian trade prior to the tenth century.--_Relation des\r\nVoyages faits par les Arabes et les Persans dans l'Inde et Chine dans le\r\nIX'e Siècle, &c._ 2 vols. 18mo. Paris, 1845.]\r\n\r\nSOLEYMAN describes the sea of Herkend, as it lay between the Laccadives\r\nand Maldives[1], on the west, and swept round eastward by Cape Comorin\r\nand Adam's Bridge to Ceylon, thus enclosing the precious fishery for\r\npearls. In Serendib, his earliest attention was devoutly directed to the\r\nsacred footstep on Adam's Peak; in his name for which, \"_Al-rohoun,\"_ we\r\ntrace the Buddhist name for the district, Rohuna, so often occurring in\r\nthe _Mahawanso_.[2] This is the earliest notice of the Mussulman\r\ntradition, which associates the story of Adam with Ceylon, though it was\r\ncurrent amongst the Copts in the fourth and fifth centuries.[3] On all\r\nsides of the mountain, he adds, are the mines of rubies, hyacinths, and\r\nother gems; the interior produces aloes; and the sea the highly valued\r\nchank shells, which served the Indians for trumpets.[4] The island was\r\nsubject to two kings; and on the death of the chief one his body was\r\nplaced on a low carriage, with the head declining till the hair swept\r\nthe ground, and, as it was drawn slowly along, a female, with a bunch of\r\nleaves, swept dust upon the features, crying: \"Men, behold your king,\r\nwhose will, but yesterday, was law! To-day, he bids farewell to the\r\nworld, and the Angel of Death has seized his spirit. Cease, any longer,\r\nto be deluded by the shadowy pleasures of life.\" At the conclusion of\r\nthis ceremony, which lasted for three days, the corpse was consumed on a\r\npyre of sandal, camphor, and aromatic woods, and the ashes scattered to\r\nthe winds.[5] The widow of the king was sometimes burnt along with his\r\nremains, but compliance with the custom was not held to be compulsory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The _\"Divi\"_ of Ammianus Marcellinus, who along with the\r\nSinghalese \"_Selendivi_\" sent ambassadors to the Emperor Julian, l xxii.\r\nc. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A portion of the district near Tangalle is known to the\r\npresent day as \"Rouna.\"--_Mahawanso_, ch. ix. p. 57; ch. xxii. p. 130,\r\n&c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See the account of Adam's Peak, Vol. II. Pt. VII. ch. ii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: ABOU-ZEYD, _Relation, &c._, vol. i. p. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _lb_., p. 50. The practice of burning the remains of the\r\nkings and of persons of exalted rank, continued as long as the native\r\ndynasty held the throne of Kandy.--See KNOX's _Historical Relation of\r\nCeylon_, A.D. 1681, Part iii. c. ii.]\r\n\r\nSuch is the account of SOLEYMAN, but, in the second part of the\r\nmanuscript, ABOU-ZEYD, on the authority of another informant, IBN WAHAB,\r\nwho had sailed to the same countries, speaks of the pearls of Ceylon,\r\nand adds, regarding its precious stones, that they were obtained in part\r\nfrom the soil, but chiefly from those points of the beach at which the\r\nrivers flowed into the sea and to which the gems are carried down by the\r\ntorrents from the hills.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ibid_., vol. i. p. 127.]\r\n\r\nABOU-ZEYD describes the frequent conventions of the heads of the\r\nnational religion, and the attendance of scribes to write down from\r\ntheir dictation the doctrines of Buddhism, the legends of its prophets,\r\nand the precepts of its law. This statement has an obvious reference to\r\nthe important events recorded in the _Mahawanso_[1] of the reduction of\r\nthe tenets, orally delivered by Buddha, to their written form, as they\r\nappear in the _Pittakatayan_; to the translation of the _Atthakatha_,\r\nfrom Singhalese into Pali, in the reign of Mahanamo, A.D. 410-432; and\r\nto the singular care displayed, at all times, by the kings and the\r\npriesthood, to preserve authentic records of every event connected with\r\nthe national religion and its history.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxiii. p. 207; ch. xxxvii. p. 252.]\r\n\r\nABOU-ZEYD adverts to the richness of the temples of the Singhalese, and\r\nto the colossal dimensions of their statues, and dwells with\r\nparticularity on their toleration of all religious sects as attested by\r\nthe existence there, in the ninth century, of a sect of Manichæans, and\r\na community of Jews.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It was to Ceylon that the terrified worshippers of Siva\r\nbetook themselves in their flight, when Mahmoud of Ghuznee smote the\r\nidol and overthrew the temple of Somnaut, A.D. 1025. (FERISHTA, transl.\r\nby Briggs, vol. i. p. 71; REINAUD, _Introd. to_ ABOULFEDA, vol. i. p.\r\ncccxlix. _Mémoires sur l'Inde_, p. 270.) Twenty years previously, when\r\nthe same orthodox invader routed the schismatic Carmathians at Moultan,\r\nthe fugitive chief of the Sheahs found an asylum in Ceylon. (REINAUD,\r\n_Journ. Asiat_., vol. xlv. p. 283; vol. xlvi. p. 129.) The latter\r\ncircumstance serves to show that the Mahometans in Ceylon have not been\r\nuniformly Sonnees, and it may probably throw light on a fact of much\r\nlocal interest connected with Colombo. There formerly stood there, in\r\nthe Mahometan Cemetery, a stone with an ancient inscription in Cufic\r\ncharacters, which no one could decipher, but which was said to record\r\nthe virtues of a man of singular virtue, who had arrived in the island\r\nin the tenth century. About the year 1787 A.D., one of the Dutch\r\nofficials removed the stone to the spot where he was building, \"and\r\nplaced it where it now stands, at one of the steps to his door.\" This is\r\nthe account given by Sir Alexander Johnston, who, in 1827, sent a copy\r\nof the inscription to the Royal Asiatic Society of London. GILDEMEISTER\r\npronounces it to be written in Carmathic characters, and to commemorate\r\nan Arab who died A.D. 848. \"Karmathacis quæ dicuntur literis exarata\r\nviro cuidam Arabo Mortuo, 948 A.D. posita,\" _Script. Arabi de Rebus\r\nIndicis_, p. 59. A translation of the inscription by Lee was published\r\nin _Trans, Roy. Asiat. Soc._, vol. i. p. 545, from which it appears that\r\nthe deceased, Khalid Ibn Abou Bakaya, distinguished himself by obtaining\r\n\"security for religion, with other advantages, in the year 317 of the\r\nHejira.\" LEE was disposed to think that this might be the tomb of the\r\nImaum Abu Abd Allah; who first taught the Mahometans the route by which\r\npilgrims might proceed from India to the sacred footstep on Adam's Peak.\r\nBut besides the discrepancy of the names, the Imaum died in the year\r\nA.D. 953, and interred at Shiraz, where Ibn Batata made a visit to his\r\ntomb. (_Travels_, transl. DEFRÉMERY, &c., tom. ii. p. 79.)\r\n\r\nEDRISI, in his Geography writing in the twelfth century, confirms the\r\naccount of Abou-zeyd as to the toleration of all sects in Ceylon, and\r\nillustrates it by the fact, that of the sixteen officers who formed the\r\ncouncil of the king, four were Buddhists, four Mussulmans, four\r\nChristians, and four Jews.--GILDEMEISTER, _Script. Arabi_, &c., p. 53;\r\nEDRISI, 1 clim. sec. 6.]\r\n\r\nIbn Wahab, his informant, appears to have looked back with singular\r\npleasure to the delightful voyages which he had made through the\r\nremarkable still-water channels, elsewhere described, which form so\r\npeculiar a feature in the seaborde of Ceylon, and to which the Arabs\r\ngave the obscure term of \"gobbs.\"[1] Here months were consumed by the\r\nmariners, amidst flowers and overhanging woods, with the enjoyments of\r\nabundant food and exhilarating draughts of arrack flavoured with honey.\r\nThe natives of the island were devoted to pleasure, and their days were\r\nspent in cock-fighting and games of chance, into which they entered with\r\nso much eagerness as to wager the joints of their fingers when all else\r\nwas lost.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"_Aghbah_,\" Arab. For an account of those of Ceylon, see\r\nVol. I. Pt I. ch. i. p. 42. The idea entertained by the Arabs of these\r\nGobbs, will be found in a passage from Albyrouni, given by REINAUD,\r\n_Fragmens Arabes_, &c., 119, and _Journ. Asiat_. vol. xlv. p. 201. See\r\nalso EDRISI, _Geog_., tom. i. p. 73.]\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting passages in the narrative of Abou-zeyd are\r\nthose which allude to the portion of Ceylon which served as the emporium\r\nfor the active and opulent trade of which the island was then, in every\r\nsense of the word, the centre. Gibbon, on no other ground than its\r\n\"capacious harbour,\" pronounces Trincomalie to be the port which\r\nreceived and dismissed the fleets of the East and West.[1] But the\r\nnautical grounds are even stronger than the historical for regarding\r\nthis as improbable;--the winds and the currents, as well as its\r\ngeographical position, render Trincomalie difficult of access to vessels\r\ncoming from the Red Sea or the Persian Gulf; and it is evident from the\r\nnarrative of Soleyman and Ibn Wahab, that ships availing themselves of\r\nthe monsoons to cross the Indian Ocean, crept along the shore to Cape\r\nComorin; and passed close by Adam's Bridge to reach their destined\r\nports.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Decline and Fall_, ch. xl.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: ABOU-ZEYD, vol. i. p. 128; REINAUD, _Discours; &c._, pp.\r\nlx.--lxix.; _Introd._ ABOULFEDA, p. cdxii.]\r\n\r\nAn opinion has been advanced by Bertolacci that the entrepôt was\r\nMantotte, at the northern extremity of the Gulf of Manaar. Presuming\r\nthat the voyages both ways were made through the Manaar channel, he\r\ninfers that the ships of Arabia and India, rather than encounter the\r\nlong delay of waiting for the change of the monsoon to effect the\r\npassage, would prefer to \"flock to the Straits of Manaar, and those\r\nwhich, from their size, could not pass the shallow water, would be\r\nunloaded, and their merchandise trans-shipped into other vessels, as\r\nthey arrived from the opposite coast, or deposited in stores to await an\r\nopportunity of conveyance.\"[1] Hence Mantotte, he concludes, was the\r\nstation chosen for such combined operations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: BERTOLACCI'S _Ceylon_, pp. 18,19.]\r\n\r\nBut Bertolacci confines his remarks to the Arabian and Indian crafts\r\nalone: he leaves out of consideration the ships of the largest size\r\ncalled in the _Periplus_ [Greek: kolandiophônta], which kept up the\r\ncommunication between the west and east coast of India, in the time of\r\nthe Romans, and he equally overlooks the great junks of the Chinese,\r\nwhich, by aid of the magnetic compass[1], made bold passages from Java\r\nto Malabar, and from Malabar to Oman,--vessels which (on the authority\r\nof an ancient Arabic MS.) Reinaud says carried from four to five hundred\r\nmen, with arms and naphtha, to defend themselves against the pirates of\r\nIndia.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The knowledge of the mariner's compass probably possessed\r\nby the Chinese prior to the twelfth century, is discussed by KLAPROTH in\r\nhis \"_Lettre à M. le Baron Humboldt sur l'invention de la boussole_.\"\r\nParis, 1834.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See the _\"Katab-al-adjajab_,\" probably written by MASSOUDI.\r\nREINAUD, _Mémoires sur l'Inde_, p. 200; _Relation et Discours_, pp. lx.\r\nlxviii.; ABOULFEDA, _Introd_. cdxii. May not this early mention of the\r\nuse of \"naphtha\" by the Chinese for burning the ships of an enemy, throw\r\nsome light on the disquisitions adverted to by GIBBON, ch. lii., as to\r\nthe nature of \"the _Greek fire_,\" so destructive to the fleets of their\r\nassailants during the first and second siege of Constantinople in the\r\nseventh and eighth centuries? GIBBON says that the principal ingredient\r\nwas naphtha, and that the Greek emperor learned the secret of its\r\ncomposition from a Syrian who deserted from the service of the Khalif.\r\nDid the Khalif acquire the knowledge from the Chinese, whose ships, it\r\nappears, were armed with some preparation of this nature in their\r\nvoyages to Bassora?]\r\n\r\nOn this point we have the personal testimony of the Chinese traveller Fa\r\nHian, who at the end of the fourth century sailed direct from Ceylon for\r\nChina, in a merchant vessel so large as to accommodate two hundred\r\npersons, and having in tow a smaller one, as a precaution against\r\ndangers by sea[1]:--and Ibn Batuta saw, at Calicut, in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, junks from China capable of accommodating a thousand men, of\r\nwhom four hundred were soldiers, and each of these large ships was\r\nfollowed by three smaller.[2] With vessels of such magnitude, it would\r\nbe neither expedient nor practicable to navigate the shallows in the\r\nvicinity of Manaar; and besides, Mantotte, or, as it was anciently\r\ncalled, _Mahatitta_ or _Maha-totta_, \"the great ferry,\" although it\r\nexisted as a port upwards of four hundred years before the Christian\r\nera, was at no period an emporium of commerce. Being situated so close\r\nto the ancient capital, Anarajapoora, it derived its notoriety from\r\nbeing the point of arrival and departure of the Malabars who resorted to\r\nthe island; and the only trade for which it afforded facilities was the\r\noccasional importation of the produce of the opposite coast of India.[3]\r\nIt is not only probable, but almost certain that during the middle ages,\r\nand especially prior to the eleventh century, when the trade with Persia\r\nand Arabia was at its height, Mantotte afforded the facilities indicated\r\nby Bertolacci to the smaller craft that availed themselves of the\r\nPaumbam passage; but we have still to ascertain the particular harbour\r\nwhich was the centre of the more important commerce between China and\r\nthe West. That harbour I believe to have been Point de Galle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Fo[)e]-kou[)e]-ki_, ch. xl. p. 359). In a previous\r\npassage, FA HIAN describes the large vessels in which the trade was\r\ncarried between Tamlook, on the Hoogly, and Ceylon:--\"A cette époque,\r\ndes marchands, se mettant en mer avec de grands vaisseaux, firent route\r\nvers le sud-ouest; et au commencement de l'hiver, le vent étant\r\nfavorable, après une navigation de quatorze nuits et d'autant de jours,\r\non arriva au _Royaume des Lions_.\"--_Ibid_. chap. xxxvi. p. 328.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: IBN BATUTA, Lee's translation, p. 172.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. vii. p. 51; ch. xxv. p. 155; ch. xxxv. p.\r\n217.]\r\n\r\nAbou-zeyd describes the rendezvous of the ships arriving from Oman,\r\nwhere they met those bound for the Persian Gulf, as lying half-way\r\nbetween Arabia and China. \"It was the centre,\" he says, \"of the trade in\r\naloes and camphor, in sandal-wood, ivory and lead.\"[1] This emporium he\r\ndenominates \"Kalah,\" and when we remember that lie is speaking of a\r\nvoyage which he had not himself made, and of countries then very\r\nimperfectly known to the people of the West, we shall not be surprised\r\nthat he calls it an island, or rather a peninsula.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: ABOU-ZEYD, _Relation, &c._, vol. i. p. 93; REINAUD, _Disc._\r\np. lxxiv.]\r\n\r\nAccording to him, it was at that period subject to the Maharaja of\r\nZabedj, the sovereign of a singular kingdom of which little is known,\r\nbut which appears to have been formed about the commencement of the\r\nChristian era; and which, in the eighth and ninth centuries, extended\r\nover the groups of islands south and west of Malacca, including Borneo,\r\nJava, and Sumatra, which had become the resort of a vast population of\r\nIndians, Chinese, and Malays.[1] The sovereign of this opulent empire\r\nhad brought under his dominion the territory of the King of Comar, the\r\nsouthern extremity of the Dekkan[2], and at the period when Abou-zeyd\r\nwrote, he likewise claimed the sovereignty of \"Kalah.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Journ. Asiat._ vol. xlix. p. 206; ELPHINSTONE's _India_,\r\nb. iii. ch. x. p. 168; REINAUD, _Mémoires sur l'Inde_, p. 39; _Introd._\r\nABOULFEDA, p. cccxc. Baron Walckenaer has ascertained, from the puranas\r\nand other Hindu sources, that the Great Dynasty of the Maharaja\r\ncontinued till A.D. 628, after which the islands were sub-divided into\r\nnumerous sovereignties. See MAJOR's _Introduction to the Indian Voyages\r\nin the Fifteenth Century,_ in the _Hakluyt Soc. Publ._ p. xxvii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: MASSOUDI relates the conquest of the kingdom of Comar by\r\nthe Maharaja of Zabedj, nearly in the same words as it is told by\r\nAbou-zeyd; GILDEMEISTER, _Script. Arab_., pp. 145, 146. REINAUD.\r\n_Memoires sur l'Inde_, p. 225.]\r\n\r\nThis incident is not mentioned in the Singhalese chronicles, but their\r\nsilence is not to be regarded as conclusive evidence against its\r\nprobability; the historians of the Hindus ignore the expedition of\r\nAlexander the Great, and it is possible that those of Ceylon,\r\nindifferent to all that did not directly concern the religion of Buddha,\r\nmay have felt little interest in the fortunes of Galle, situated as it\r\nwas at the remote extremity of the island, and in a region that hardly\r\nacknowledged a nominal allegiance to the Singhalese crown.\r\n\r\nThe assertion of Abou-zeyd as to the sovereignty of the Maharaja of\r\nZabedj, at Kalah, is consistent with the statement of Soleyman in the\r\nfirst portion of the work, that \"the island was in subjection to two\r\nmonarchs;\"[1] and this again agrees with the report of Sopater to Cosmas\r\nIndico-pleustes, who adds that the king who possessed the hyacinth was\r\nat enmity with the king of the country in which were the harbour and the\r\ngreat emporium.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Relation_, vol. i. p. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: [Greek: Duo ie basileis eisin en tê nêsô enantioi allêlôn,\r\nho eis echôn ton huakinthon, kai d eteros to meros to allo en ps esti\r\nemporion kai hê lêinê.]\r\n\r\nCOSMAS INDIC.]\r\n\r\nBut there is evidence that the subjection of this portion of Ceylon to\r\nthe chief of the great insular empire was at that period currently\r\nbelieved in the East. In the a \"_Garsharsp-Namah_\" a Persian poem of the\r\ntenth century, by Asedi, a manuscript of which was in the possession of\r\nSir William Ouseley, the story turns on a naval expedition, fitted out\r\nby Delak, whose dominions extended from Persia to Palestine, and\r\ndespatched at the request of the Maharaja against Baku, the King of\r\nCeylon, and in the course of the narrative, Garsharsp and his fleet\r\nreach their destination at Kalah, and there achieve a victory over the\r\n\"Shah of Serendib.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: OUSELEY'S _Travels_, vol. i. p. 48.]\r\n\r\nIt must be observed, that one form of the Arabic letter K is sounded\r\nlike G, so that Kalah would be pronounced _Gala_.[1] The identity,\r\nhowever, is established not merely by similarity of sound, but by the\r\nconcurrent testimony of Cosmas and the Arabian geographers[2], as to the\r\nnature and extent of the intercourse between China and Persia,\r\nstatements which are intelligible if referred to that particular point,\r\nbut inapplicable to any other.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Kalah_ may possibly be identical with the Singhalese word\r\n_gala_, which means an \"enclosure,\" and the deeply bayed harbour of\r\nGalle would serve to justify the name. _Galla_ signifies a rock, and\r\nthis derivation would be equally sustained by the natural features of\r\nthe place, and dangerous coral reefs which obstruct the entrance to the\r\nport.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: DULAURIER, in the _Journal Asiatique_ for Sept. 1846, vol.\r\nxlix. p. 209, has brought together the authorities of Aboulfeda,\r\nKazwini, and others to show that Kalah be situated in Ceylon, and he has\r\ncombated the conjecture of M. Alfred Maury that it may be identical with\r\nKedsh in the Malay Peninsula.--REINAUD, _Relation, &c. Disc._, pp.\r\nxli.--lxxxiv., _Introd._ ABOULFEDA, p. ccxviii.]\r\n\r\nCoupled with these considerations, however, the identity of name is not\r\nwithout its significance. It was the habit of the Singhalese to apply to\r\na district the name of the principal place within it; thus Lanka, which\r\nin the epic of the Hindus was originally the capital and castle of\r\nRavana, was afterwards applied to the island in general; and according\r\nto the _Mahawanso_, Tambapani, the point of the coast where Wijayo\r\nlanded, came to designate first the wooded country that surrounded it,\r\nand eventually the whole area of Ceylon.[1] In the same manner _Galla_\r\nserved to describe not only the harbour of that name, but the district\r\nnorth and east of it to the extent of 600 square miles, and De Barros,\r\nDe Couto, and Ribeyro, the chroniclers of the Portuguese in Ceylon,\r\nrecord it as a tradition of the island, that the inhabitants of that\r\nregion had acquired the name of the locality, and were formerly known as\r\n\"Gallas.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. vii. p. 50.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A notice of this tribe will be found in another place. See\r\nVol. II. Pt. VII. ch. ii.]\r\n\r\nGalle therefore, in the earlier ages, appears to have occupied a\r\nposition in relation to trade of equal if not of greater importance than\r\nthat which attaches to it at the present day. It was the central\r\nemporium of a commerce which in turn enriched every country of Western\r\nAsia, elevated the merchants of Tyre to the rank of princes, fostered\r\nthe renown of the Ptolemies, rendered the wealth and the precious\r\nproducts of Arabia a gorgeous mystery[1], freighted the Tigris with\r\n\"barbaric pearl and gold,\" and identified the merchants of Bagdad and\r\nthe mariners of Bassora with associations of adventure and romance. Yet,\r\nstrange to say, the native Singhalese appear to have taken no part\r\nwhatever in this exciting and enriching commerce; their name is never\r\nmentioned in connection with the immigrant races attracted by it to\r\ntheir shores, and the only allusions of travellers to the indigenous\r\ninhabitants of the island are in connection with a custom so remarkable\r\nand so peculiar as at once to identify the tribes to whom it is ascribed\r\nwith the remnant of the aboriginal race of Veddahs, whose descendants\r\nstill haunt the forests in the east of Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \" ... intactis opulentior Thesauris Arabum, et divitis\r\nIndiæ.\" HORACE.]\r\n\r\nSuch is the aversion of this untamed race to any intercourse with\r\ncivilised life, that when in want of the rude implements essential to\r\ntheir savage economy, they repair by night to the nearest village on the\r\nconfines of their hunting-fields, and indicating by well-understood\r\nsigns and models the number and form of the articles required, whether\r\narrow-heads, hatchets, or cloths, they deposit an equivalent portion of\r\ndried deer's flesh or honey near the door of the dealer, and retire\r\nunseen to the jungles, returning by stealth within a reasonable time, to\r\ncarry away the manufactured articles, which they find placed at the same\r\nspot in exchange.\r\n\r\nThis singular custom has been described without variation by numerous\r\nwriters on Ceylon, both in recent and remote times. To trace it\r\nbackwards, it is narrated, nearly as I have stated it, by Robert Knox in\r\n1681[1]; and it is confirmed by Valentyn, the Dutch historian of\r\nCeylon[2]; as well as by Ribeyro, the Portuguese, who wrote somewhat\r\nearlier.[3] Albyrouni, the geographer, who in the reign of Mahomet of\r\nGhuznee, A.D. 1030, described this singular feature in the trade with\r\nthe island, of which he speaks under the name of Lanka, says that it was\r\nthe belief of the Arabian mariners that the parties with whom they held\r\ntheir mysterious dealings were demons or savages.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: KNOX, _Historical Relation, &c._, part iii. ch. i. p. 62.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: VALENTYN, _Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indien_, ch. iii. p. 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"Lorsqu'ils ont besoin de haches on de flèches, ils font un\r\nmodèle avec des feuilles d'arbre, et vont la nuit porter ce modèle, et\r\nla moitié d'un cerf on d'un sanglier, à la porte d'un armurier, qui\r\nvoyant le matin cette viande penduë à sa porte, sçait ce que cela veut\r\ndire: il travaille aussi-tôt et 3 jours après il pend les flêches ou les\r\nhaches au même endroit où étoit la viande, et la nuit suivante le Beda\r\nles vient prendre.\"--RIBEYRO, _Hist. de Ceylan_, A.D. 1686, ch. xxiv. p.\r\n179.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"Les marins se réunissent pour dire que lorsque les navires\r\nsont arrivés dans ces parages, quelques uns de l'équipage montent sur\r\ndes chaloupes et descendent à terre pour y déposer, soit de l'argent,\r\nsoit des objets utiles à la personne des habitans, tels que des pagnes,\r\ndu sel, etc. Le lendemain, quand ils reviennent, ils trouvent à la place\r\nde l'argent des pagnes et du sel, une quantité de girofle d'une valeur\r\négale. On ajoute que ce commerce se fait avec des génies, ou, suivant\r\nd'autres; avec des hommes restés à l'état sauvage.\"--ALBYROUNI, _transl.\r\nby_ REINAUD, _Introd. to_ ABOULFEDA, sec. iii. p. ccc. See also REINAUD,\r\n_Mém. sur l'Inde_, p. 343. I have before alluded (p. 538, _n_.) to the\r\ntreatise _De Moribus Brachmanorum_, ascribed to Palladius, one version\r\nof which is embodied in the spurious Life of Alexander the Great,\r\nwritten by the Pseudo-Callisthenes. In it the traveller from Thebes, who\r\nis the author's informant, states, that when in Ceylon, he obtained\r\npepper from the Besadæ, and succeeded in getting so near them as to be\r\nable to describe accurately their appearance, their low stature and\r\nfeeble configuration, their large heads and shaggy uncut hair,--a\r\ndescription which in every particular agrees with the aspect of the\r\nVeddahs at the present day. His expression that he succeeded in \"getting\r\nnear\" them, [Greek: ertasa engus tôn kaloumenôn Besadôn] shows their\r\npropensity to conceal themselves even when bringing the articles which\r\nthey had collected in the woods to sell.--PSEUDO-CALLISTHENES, lib.\r\niii. ch. vii. Paris, 1846, p. 103.]\r\n\r\nConcurrent testimony, to the same effect, is found in the recital of the\r\nChinese Buddhist, Fa Hian, who in the third century describes, in his\r\ntravels, the same strange peculiarity of the inhabitants in those days,\r\nwhom he also designates \"demons,\" who deposited, unseen, the precious\r\narticles which they come down to barter with the foreign merchants\r\nresorting to their shores.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Les marchands des autre royaumes y faisaient le commerce:\r\nquand le temps de ce commerce était venu, les génies et les démons ne\r\nparaissaient pas; mais ils mettaient en avant des choses précieuses dont\r\nils marquaient le juste prix,--s'il convenait aux marchands, ceuxci\r\nl'acquittaient et prenaient le marchandise.\"--FA HIAN,\r\n_Foe[)e]-kou[)e]-ki. Transl._ RÉMUSAT, ch. xxxviii. p. 332\r\n\r\nThere are a multitude of Chinese authorities to the same effect. One of\r\nthe most remarkable books in any language is a Chinese Encyclopædia\r\nwhich under the title of _Wen-hian-thoung-khao_, or \"_Researches into\r\nancient Monuments_,\" contains a history of every art and science form\r\nthe commencement of the empire to the era of the author MA-TOUAN-LIN,\r\nwho wrote in the thirteenth century. M. Stanislas Julien has published\r\nin the _Journal Asiatique_ for July 1836 a translation of that portion\r\nof this great work which has relation to Ceylon. It is there stated of\r\nthe aborigines that when \"les marchands des autres royaumes y venaient\r\ncommercer, _ils ne laissaient pas voir leurs corps_, et montraient au\r\nmoyen de pierres précieuses le prix que pouvaient valoir les\r\nmerchandises. Les marchands venaient et en prenaient une quantité\r\néquivalente à leurs marchandises.\"--_Journ. Asiat._ t. xxviii. p. 402;\r\nxxiv. p. 41. I have extracts from seven other Chinese works, written\r\nbetween the seventh and the twelfth centuries, in all of which there\r\noccurs the same account of Ceylon,--that it was formerly supposed to be\r\ninhabited by dragons and demons, and that when \"merchants from all\r\nnations come to trade with the, they are invisible, but leave their\r\nprecious wares spread out with an indication of the value set on them,\r\nand the Chinese take them at the prices stipulated.\"--_Leang-shoo_,\r\n\"History of the Leang Dynasty,\" A.D. 630, b. liv. p. 13. _Nân-shè_,\r\n\"History of the Southern Empire,\" A.D. 650, p. xxxviii. p. 14.\r\n_Jung-teen_, \"Cyclopædia of History,\" A.D. 740, b. cxciii. p. 8.

The envoys stated, at Rome, that the habit of\r\nthe people of their country was, on the arrival of traders, to go to\r\n\"the further side of some river where wares and commodities are laid\r\ndown by the strangers, and if the natives list to make exchange, they\r\nhave them taken away, and leave other merchandise in lieu thereof, to\r\ncontent the foreign merchant.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: PLINY, _Nat. Hist_., lib. vi. ch. xxiv. Transl. Philemon\r\nHolland, p. 130. This passage has been sometimes supposed to refer to\r\nthe Seræ, but a reference to the text will confirm the opinion of\r\nMARTIANUS and SOLINUS, that Pliny applies it to the Singhalese; and that\r\nthe allusion to red hair and grey eyes, \"rutilis comis\" and \"cæruleis\r\noculis\" applies to some northern tribes whom the Singhalese had seen in\r\ntheir overland journeys to China, \"Later travellers,\" says COOLEY, \"have\r\nlikewise had glimpses, on the frontiers of India, of these German\r\nfeatures; but nothing is yet known with certainty of the tribe to which\r\nthey properly belonged.\"--_Hist. Inland and Maritime Discovery_, vol. i.\r\np. 71.]\r\n\r\nThe fact, thus established, of the aversion to commerce, immemorially\r\nevinced by the southern Singhalese, and of their desire to escape from\r\nintercourse with the strangers resorting to trade on their coasts,\r\nserves to explain the singular scantiness of information regarding the\r\ninterior of the island which is apparent in the writings of the Arabians\r\nand Persians, between the eighth and thirteenth centuries. Their\r\nknowledge of the coast was extensive, they were familiar with the lofty\r\nmountain which served as its landmark, they dwell with admiration on its\r\nproductions, and record with particularity the objects of commerce which\r\nwere to be found in the island; but, regarding the Singhalese themselves\r\nand their social and intellectual condition, little, if any, real\r\ninformation is to be gleaned from the Oriental geographers of the middle\r\nages.\r\n\r\nALBATENY and MASSOUDI, the earliest of the Arabian geographers[1], were\r\ncontemporaries of Abou-zeyd, in the ninth century, and neither adds much\r\nto the description of Ceylon, given in the narratives of \"_The two\r\nMahometans_.\" The former assigns to the island the fabulous dimensions\r\nascribed to it by the Hindus, and only alludes to the ruby and the\r\nsapphire[2] as being found in the rivers that flow from its majestic\r\nmountains. MASSOUDI asserts that he visited Ceylon[3], and describes,\r\nfrom actual knowledge, the funeral ceremonies of a king, and the\r\nincremation of his remains; but as these are borrowed almost verbatim\r\nfrom the account given by Soleyman[4], there is reason to believe that\r\nhe merely copied from Abou-zeyd the portions of the \"_Meadows of\r\nGold_\"[5] that have relation to Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Probably the earliest allusion to Ceylon by any Arabian or\r\nPersian author, is that of Tabari, who was born in A.D. 838; but he\r\nlimits his notices to an exaggerated account of Adam's Peak, \"than which\r\nthe whole world does not contain a mountain of greater\r\nheight.\"--OUSELLY'S _Travels_, vol i. p. 34, _n_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"Le rubis rouge, et la pierre qui est couleur de ciel.\"\r\nALBATENY, quoted by Reinaud, _Introd_. ABOULFEDA p. ccclxxxv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: MASSOUDI in Gildemeister, _Script. Arab_. p. 154.\r\nGildemeister discredits the assertion of Massoudi, that he had been in\r\nCeylon. (_Ib._ p. 154, _n_.) He describes Kalah as an island distinct\r\nfrom Serendib.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: ABOU-ZEYD, _Relation, &c_., p. 50.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: A translation of MASSOUDI'S _Meadows of Gold_ in English\r\nwas begun by Dr. Sprenger for the \"Oriental Translation Fund,\" but it\r\nhas not advanced beyond the first volume, which was published in 1841.]\r\n\r\nIn the order of time, this is the place to allude to another Arabian\r\nmariner, whose voyages have had a world-wide renown, and who, more than\r\nany other author, ancient or modern, has contributed to familiarise\r\nEurope with the name and wonders of Serendib. I allude to \"Sindbad of\r\nthe Sea,\" whose voyages were first inserted by Galland, in his French\r\ntranslation of the \"_Thousand-and-one Nights_.\" Sindbad, in his own\r\ntale, professes to have lived in the reign of the most illustrious\r\nKhalif of the Abbassides,--\r\n\r\n  \"Sole star of all that place and time;--\r\n   And saw him, in his golden prime,\r\n     The good Haroun Alraschid.\"\r\n\r\nBut Haroun died, A.D. 808, and Sindbad's narrative is so manifestly\r\nbased on the recitals of Abou-zeyd and Massoudi, that although the\r\nauthor may have lived shortly after, it is scarcely possible that he\r\ncould have been a contemporary of the great ruler of Bagdad.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: REINAUD notices the _Ketab-ala-jayb_, or \"Book of Wonders,\"\r\nof MASSOUDI, as one of the works whence the materials of Sindbad's\r\nVoyages were drawn. (_Introd_. ABOULFEDA, vol. i. p. lxxvii.) HOLE\r\npublished in 1797 A.D. his learned _Remarks on the Origin of Sindbad's\r\nVoyages_, and in that work, as well as in LANGLE'S edition of Sindbad;\r\nand in the notes by LANE to his version of the \"_Arabian Nights'\r\nEntertainment_,\" Edrisi, Kazwini, and many other writers are mentioned\r\nwhose works contain parallel statements. But though Edrisi and Kazwini\r\nwrote in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, it does not follow that\r\nthe author of Sindbad lived later than they, as both may have borrowed\r\ntheir illustrations from the same early sources.]\r\n\r\nOne inference is clear, from the story of Sindbad, that whilst the\r\nsea-coast of Ceylon was known to the Arabians, the interior had been\r\nlittle explored by them, and was so enveloped in mystery that any tale\r\nof its wonders, however improbable, was sure to gain credence. Hence,\r\nwhat Sindbad relates of the shore and its inhabitants is devoid of\r\nexaggeration: in his first visit the natives who received him were\r\nMalabars, one of whom had learned Arabic, and they were engaged in\r\nirrigating their rice lands from a tank. These are incidents which are\r\ncharacteristic of the north-western coast of Ceylon at the present day;\r\nand the commerce, for which the island was remarkable in the ninth and\r\ntenth centuries is implied by the expression of Sindbad, that on the\r\noccasion of his next voyage, when bearing presents and a letter from the\r\nKhalif to the King of Serendib, he embarked at Bassora in a ship, and\r\nwith him \"were many merchants.\"\r\n\r\nOf the Arabian authors of the middle ages the one who dwells most\r\nlargely on Ceylon is EDRISI, born of a family who ruled over Malaga\r\nafter the fall of the Khalifs of Cordova. He was a _protégé_ of the\r\nSicilian king, Roger the Norman, at whose desire he compiled his\r\nGeography, A.D. 1154. But with regard to Ceylon, his pages contain only\r\nthe oft-repeated details of the height of the holy mountain, the gems\r\nfound in its ravines, the musk, the perfumes, and odoriferous woods\r\nwhich abound there.[1] He particularises twelve cities, but their names\r\nare scarcely identifiable with any now known.[2] The sovereign, who was\r\ncelebrated for the mildness of his rule, was assisted by a council of\r\nsixteen, of whom four were of the national religion, four Christians,\r\nfour Mussulmans, and four Jews; and one of the chief cares of the\r\ngovernment was given to keeping up the historical records of the reigns\r\nof their kings, the lives of their prophets, and the sacred books of\r\ntheir law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: EDRISI mentions, that at that period the sugar-cane was\r\ncultivated in Ceylon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Marnaba, (_Manaar?_) Aghna Perescouri, (_Periatorre?_)\r\nAide, Mahouloun, (_Putlam?_) Hamri, Telmadi, (_Talmanaar?_) Lendouma,\r\nSedi; Hesli, Beresli and Medouna (_Matura?_). \"Aghna\" or \"Ana,\" as\r\nEdrisi makes it the residence of the king, must be Anarajapoora.]\r\n\r\nShips from China and other distant countries resorted to the island, and\r\nhither \"came the wines of Irak, and Fars, which are purchased by the\r\nking, and sold again to his subjects; for, unlike the princes of India,\r\nwho encourage debauchery but strictly forbid wine, the King of Serendib\r\nrecommends wine and prohibits debauchery.\" The exports of the island he\r\ndescribes as silk, precious stones of every hue, rock-crystal, diamonds,\r\nand a profusion of perfumes.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: EDRISI, _Géogr._ Transl. de Jaubert, 4to. Paris, 1836, t.\r\ni. p. 71, &c. Edrisi, in his \"Notice of Ceylon,\" quotes largely and\r\nverbatim from the work of Abou-zeyd.]\r\n\r\nThe last of this class of writers to whom it is necessary to allude is\r\nKAZWINI, who lived at Bagdad in the thirteenth century, and, from the\r\ndiversified nature of his writings, has been called the Pliny of the\r\nEast. In his geographical account of India, he includes Ceylon, but it\r\nis evident from the details into which he enters of the customs of the\r\ncourt and the people, the burning of the widows of the kings on the same\r\npile with their husbands, that the information he had received had been\r\ncollected amongst the Brahmanical, not the Buddhist portion of the\r\npeople. This is confirmatory of the actual condition of the people of\r\nCeylon at the period as shown by the native chronicles, the king being\r\nthe Malabar Magha, who invaded the island from Caligna 1219 A.D.,\r\noverthrew the Buddhist religion, desecrated its monuments and temples,\r\nand destroyed the edifices and literary records of the capital.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. lxxx. _Rajaratnacari_, p. 93; _Rajavali_,\r\np. 256. TURNOUR'S _Epitome, &c_., p. 44.]\r\n\r\nKAZWINI, as usual, dwells on the productions of the island, its spices,\r\nand its odours, its precious woods and medical drugs, its profusion of\r\ngems, its gold and silver work, and its pearls[1]: but one circumstance\r\nwill not fail to strike the reader as a strange omission in these\r\nfrequent enumerations of the exports of Ceylon. I have traced them from\r\ntheir earliest notices by the Greeks and Romans to the period when the\r\ncommerce of the East had reached its climax in the hands of the Persians\r\nand Arabians; the survey extends over fifteen centuries, during which\r\nCeylon and its productions were familiarly known to the traders of all\r\ncountries, and yet in the pages of no author, European or Asiatic, from\r\nthe earliest ages to the close of the thirteenth century, is there the\r\nremotest allusion to _Cinnamon_ as an indigenous production, or even as\r\nan article of commerce in Ceylon. I may add, that I have been equally\r\nunsuccessful in finding any allusion to it in any Chinese work of\r\nancient date.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: KAZWINI, in Gildemeister, _Script. Arab_. p. 108.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In the Chinese Materia Medica, \"_Pun-tsao-kang-muh_,\"\r\ncinnamon or cassia is described under the name of \"_kwei_\" but always as\r\na production of Southern China and of Cochin China. In the Ming History,\r\na production of Ceylon is mentioned under the name of \"_Shoo-heang_,\" or\r\n\"tree-perfume;\" but my informant, Mr. Wylie, of Shanghae, is unable to\r\nidentify it with cinnamon oil.]\r\n\r\nThis unexpected result has served to cast a suspicion on the title of\r\nCeylon to be designated _par excellence_ the \"Cinnamon Isle,\" and even\r\nwith the knowledge that the cinnamon laurel is indigenous there, it\r\nadmits of but little doubt that the spice which in the earlier ages was\r\nimported into Europe through Arabia, was obtained, first from Africa,\r\nand afterwards from India; and that it was not till after the twelfth or\r\nthirteenth century that its existence in Ceylon became known to the\r\nmerchants resorting to the island. So little was its real history known\r\nin Europe, even at the latter period, that Phile, who composed his\r\nmetrical treatise, [Greek: Peri Zôôn Idiotêtos], for the information of\r\nthe Emperor Michael XI. (Palæologus), about the year 1310, repeats the\r\nancient fable of Herodotus, that cinnamon grew in an unknown Indian\r\ncountry, whence it was carried by birds, from whose nests it was\r\nabstracted by the natives of Arabia.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1:\r\n\r\n  [Greek:\r\n  Ornis ho kinnamômos ônomasmenos\r\n  To kinnamômon euren agnooumenon,\r\n  Huph ou kalian organoi tois philtatois\r\n  Mallon ie tois melasin Indois, autanax\r\n  Arômatikên hêdonên diaplekei.]\r\n\r\n  PHILE, xxviii.\r\n\r\nVINCENT, in scrutinising the writings of the classical authors, anterior\r\nto Cosmas, who treated of Taprobane, was surprised to discover that no\r\nmention of cinnamon as a production of Ceylon was to be met with in\r\nPliny, Dioscorides, or Ptolemy, and that even the author of the\r\nmercantile _Periplus_ was silent regarding it. (Vol. ii. p. 512.)\r\nD'Herbelot has likewise called attention to the same fact. (_Bibl.\r\nOrient._ vol. iii. p. 308.) This omission is not to be explained by\r\nascribing it to mere inadvertence. The interest of the Greeks and Romans\r\nwas naturally excited to discover the country which produced a luxury so\r\nrare as to be a suitable gift for a king; and so costly, that a crown of\r\ncinnamon tipped with gold was a becoming offering to the gods. But the\r\nArabs succeeded in preserving the secret of its origin, and the\r\ncuriosity of Europe was baffled by tales of cinnamon being found in the\r\nnest of the Phoenix, or gathered in marshes guarded by monsters and\r\nwinged serpents. Pliny appears to have been the first to suspect that\r\nthe most precious of spices came not from Arabia, but from Æthiopia\r\n(lib. xii. c. xlii.); and COOLEY, in an argument equally remarkable for\r\ningenuity and research, has succeeded in demonstrating the soundness of\r\nthis conjecture, and establishing the fact that the cinnamon brought to\r\nEurope by the Arabs, and afterwards by the Greeks, came chiefly from the\r\neastern angle of Africa, the tract around Cape Gardafui, which is marked\r\non the ancient maps as the _Regio Cinnamomifera._ (Journ. Roy. Georg.\r\nSociety, 1849, vol. xix. p. 166.) COOLEY has suggested in his learned\r\nwork on \"_Ptolemy and the Nile_,\" that the name _Gardafui_ is a compound\r\nof the Somali word _gard_, \"a port,\" and the Arabic _afhaoni_, a generic\r\nterm for aromata and spices. It admits of no doubt that the cinnamon of\r\nCeylon was unknown to commerce in the sixth century of our era; although\r\nthere is evidence of a supply which, if not from China, was probably\r\ncarried in Chinese vessels at a much earlier period, in the Persian name\r\n_dar chini_, which means \"_Chinese wood_,\" and in the ordinary word\r\n\"cinn-amon,\" \"_Chinese amomum_,\" a generic name for aromatic spices\r\ngenerally. (NEES VON ESENBACH, _de Cinnamono Disputatio_, p. 12.)\r\nPtolemy, equally with Pliny, placed the \"Cinnamon Region\" at the\r\nnorth-eastern extremity of Africa, now the country of the Somaulees; and\r\nthe author of the _Periplus_, mindful of his object, in writing a\r\nguidebook for merchant-seamen, particularises cassia amongst the exports\r\nof the same coast; but although he enumerates the productions of Ceylon,\r\ngems, pearls, ivory, and tortoiseshell, he is silent as to cinnamon.\r\nDioscorides and Galen, in common with the travellers and geographers of\r\nthe ancients, ignore its Singhalese origin, and unite with them in\r\ntracing it to the country of the Troglodytæ. I attach no importance to\r\nthose passages in WAGENFELD'S version of _Sanchoniathon_, in which,\r\namongst other particulars, obviously describing Ceylon under the name of\r\n\"the island of Rachius,\" which he states to have been visited by the\r\nPhoenicians; he says, that the western province produced, the finest\r\ncinnamon ([Greek: kinnamô pollô te kai diapheronti]), that the mountains\r\nabounded in cassia (Greek: kasia arômatikôtatê]), and that the minor\r\nkings paid their tribute in both, to the paramount sovereign.\r\n(SANCHONIATHON, ed. Wagenfeld, Bremen, 1837, lib. vii. ch. xii.). The\r\nMS. from which Wagenfeld printed, is evidently a mediæval forgery (see\r\nnote (A) to vol. i. ch. v. p. 547). Again, it is equally strange that\r\nthe writers of Arabia and Persia preserve a similar silence as to the\r\ncinnamon of the island, although they dwell with due admiration on its\r\nother productions, in all of which they carried on a lucrative trade.\r\nSir WILLIAM OUSELEY, after a fruitless search through the writings of\r\ntheir geographers and travellers, records his surprise at this result,\r\nand mentions especially his disappointment, that Ferdousi, who enriches\r\nhis great poem with glowing descriptions of all the objects presented by\r\nsurrounding nations to the sovereigns of Persia,--ivory, ambergris, and\r\naloes, vases, bracelets, and jewels,--never once adverts to the\r\nexquisite cinnamon of Ceylon.--_Travels_, vol. i, p. 41.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion deducible from fifteen centuries of historic testimony\r\nis, that the earliest knowledge of cinnamon possessed by the western\r\nnations was derived from China, and that it first reached Judea and\r\nPhoenicia overland by way of Persia (Song of Solomon, iv. 14: Revelation\r\nxviii, 13). At a later period when the Arabs, \"the merchants of Sheba,\"\r\ncompeted for the trade of Tyre, and earned to her \"the chief of all\r\nspices\" (Ezekiel xvii. 22), their supplies were drawn from their African\r\npossessions, and the cassia of the Troglodytic coast supplanted the\r\ncinnamon of the far East, and to a great extent excluded it from the\r\nmarket. The Greeks having at length discovered the secret of the Arabs,\r\nresorted to the same countries as their rivals in commerce, and\r\nsurpassing them in practical navigation and the construction of ships,\r\nthe Sabæans were for some centuries reduced to a state of mercantile\r\ndependence and inferiority. In the meantime the Roman Empire declined;\r\nthe Persians under the Sassanides engrossed the intercourse with the\r\nEast, the trade of India now flowed through the Persian Gulf, and the\r\nports of the Red Sea were deserted. \"Thus the downfall, and it may be\r\nthe extinction, of the African spice trade probably dates from the close\r\nof the sixth century, and Malabar succeeded at once to this branch of\r\ncommerce.\"--COOLEY, _Regio Cinnamomifera_, p. 14. Cooley supposes that\r\nthe Malabars may have obtained from Ceylon the cinnamon with which they\r\nsupplied the Persians; as Ibn Batuta, in the fourteenth century, saw\r\ncinnamon trees drifted upon the shores of the island, whither they had\r\nbeen carried by torrents from the forests of the interior (_Ibn Batuta_,\r\nch. xx. p. 182). The fact of their being found so is in itself\r\nsufficient evidence, that down to that time no active trade had been\r\ncarried on in the article; and the earliest travellers in the thirteenth\r\nand fourteenth centuries, MARCO POLO, JOHN OF HESSE, FRA JORDANUS and\r\nothers, whilst they allude to cinnamon as one of the chief productions\r\nof Malabar, speak of Ceylon, notwithstanding her wealth in jewels and\r\npearls, as if she were utterly destitute of any spice of this kind.\r\nNICOLA DE CONTI, A.D. 1444, is the first European writer, in whose pages\r\nI have found Ceylon described as yielding cinnamon, and he is followed\r\nby Varthema, A.D. 1506, and Corsali, A.D. 1515.\r\n\r\nLong after the arrival of Europeans in Ceylon, cinnamon was only found\r\nin the forests of the interior, where it was cut and brought away by the\r\nChalias, the caste who, from having been originally weavers, devoted\r\nthemselves to this new employment. The Chalias are themselves an\r\nimmigrant tribe, and, according to their own tradition, they came to the\r\nisland only a very short time before the appearance of the Portuguese.\r\n(See a _History of the Chalias_, by ADRIAN RAJAPAKSE, _a Chief of the\r\nCaste, Asiat. Reser._ vol. iii. p. 440.) So difficult of access were the\r\nforests, that the Portuguese could only obtain a full supply from them\r\nonce in three years; and the Dutch, to remedy this uncertainty, made\r\nregular plantations in the vicinity of their forts about the year 1770\r\nA.D., \"_so that the cultivation of cinnamon in Ceylon is not yet a\r\ncentury old_\"--COOLEY, p. 15. It is a question for scientific research\r\nrather than for historical scrutiny, whether the cinnamon laurel of\r\nCeylon, as it exists at the present day, is indigenous to the island, or\r\nwhether it is identical with the cinnamon of Abyssinia, and may have\r\nbeen carried thence by the Arabs; or whether it was brought to the\r\nisland from the adjacent continent of India; or imported by the Chinese\r\nfrom islands still further to the east. One fact is notorious at the\r\npresent day, that nearly the whole of the cinnamon grown in Ceylon is\r\nproduced in a small and well-defined area occupying the S.W. quarter of\r\nthe island, which has been at all times the resort of foreign shipping.\r\nThe natives, from observing its appearance for the first time in other\r\nand unexpected places, believe it to be sown by the birds who carry\r\nthither the undigested seeds; and the Dutch, for this reason, prohibited\r\nthe shooting of crows,--a precaution that would scarcely be necessary\r\nfor the protection of the plant, had they believed it to be not only\r\nindigenous, but peculiar to the island. We ourselves were led, till very\r\nrecently, to imagine that Ceylon enjoyed a \"natural monopoly\" of\r\ncinnamon.\r\n\r\nMr. THWAITES, of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kandy, is of opinion from\r\nhis own observation, that cinnamon is indigenous to Ceylon, as it is\r\nfound, but of inferior quality, in the central mountain range, as high\r\nas 3000 feet above the level of the sea--and again in the sandy soil\r\nnear Batticaloa on the east coast, he saw it in such quantity as to\r\nsuggest the idea that it must be the remains of former cultivation. This\r\nstatement of Mr. Thwaites is quite in consistency with the narrative of\r\nVALENTYN (ch. vii.), that the Dutch, on their first arrival in Ceylon,\r\nA.D. 1601-2, took on board cinnamon at Batticaloa,--and that the\r\nsurrounding district continued to produce it in great abundance in A.D.\r\n1726. (Ib. ch. xv. p. 223, 224.) Still it must be observed that its\r\nappearance in these situations is not altogether inconsistent with the\r\npopular belief that the seeds may have been carried there by birds.\r\n\r\nFinding that the Singhalese works accessible to me, the _Mahawanso_, the\r\n_Rajavali_, the _Rajaratnacari_, &c., although frequently\r\nparticularising the aromatic shrubs and flowers planted by the pious\r\ncare of the native sovereigns, made no mention of cinnamon, I am\r\nindebted to the good offices of the Maha-Moodliar de Sarem, of Mr. De\r\nAlwis, the translator of the _Sidath-Sangara_, and of Mr. Spence Hardy,\r\nthe learned historian of Buddhism, for a thorough, examination of such\r\nnative books as were likely to throw light on the question. Mr. Hardy\r\nwrites to me that he has not met with the word cinnamon (_kurundu_) in\r\nany early Singhalese books; but there is mention of a substance called\r\n\"_paspalawata_\" of which cinnamon forms one of the ingredients. Mr. de\r\nAlwis has been equally unsuccessful, although in the _Saraswate\r\nNigardu_, an ancient Sanskrit Catalogue of Plants, the true cinnamon is\r\nspoken of as _Sinhalam_, a word which signifies \"belonging to Ceylon\" to\r\ndistinguish it from cassia, which is found in Hindustan. The\r\nMaha-Moodliar, as the result of an investigation made by him in\r\ncommunication with some of the most erudite of the Buddhist priesthood\r\nfamiliar with Pali and Singhalese literature, informs me that whilst\r\ncinnamon is alluded to in several Sanskrit works on Medicine, such as\r\nthat of Susrata, and thence copied into Pali translations, its name has\r\nbeen found only in Singhalese works of comparatively modern date,\r\nalthough it occurs in the treatise on Medicine and Surgery popularly\r\nattributed to King Bujas Raja, A.D. 339. Lankagodde, a learned priest of\r\nGalle, says that the word _lawanga_ in an ancient Pali vocabulary means\r\ncinnamon, but I rather think this is a mistake, for _lawanga_ or\r\n_lavanga_ is the Pali name for \"cloves,\" that for cinnamon being\r\n_lamago_.\r\n\r\nThe question therefore remains in considerable obscurity. It is\r\ndifficult to understand how an article so precious could exist in the\r\nhighest perfection in Ceylon, at the period when the island was the very\r\nfocus and centre of Eastern commerce, and yet not become an object of\r\ninterest and an item of export. And although it is sparingly used in the\r\nSinghalese cuisine, still looking at its many religious uses for\r\ndecoration and incense, the silence of the ecclesiastical writers as to\r\nits existence is not easily accounted for.\r\n\r\nThe explanation may possibly be, that cinnamon, like coffee, was\r\noriginally a native of the east angle of Africa; and that the same\r\nArabian adventurers who carried coffee to Yemen, where it flourishes to\r\nthe present day, may have been equally instrumental in introducing\r\ncinnamon into India and Ceylon. In India its cultivation, probably from\r\nnatural causes, proved unsuccessful; but in Ceylon the plant enjoyed\r\nthat rare combination of soil, temperature, and climate, which\r\nultimately gave to its qualities the highest possible development.]\r\n\r\nThe first authentic notice which we have of Singhalese cinnamon occurs\r\nin the voyages of Ibn Batuta the Moor, who, impelled by religious\r\nenthusiasm, set out from his native city Tangiers, in the year 1324, and\r\ndevoted twenty-eight years to a pilgrimage, the record of which has\r\nentitled him to rank amongst the most remarkable travellers of any age\r\nor country.\r\n\r\nOn his way to India, he visited, in Shiraz, the tomb of the Imaum Abu\r\nAbd Allah, \"who made known the way from India to the mountain of\r\nSerendib.\" As this saint died in the year of the _Hejira_ 331, his story\r\nserves to fix the origin of the Mahometan pilgrimages to Adam's Peak, in\r\nthe early part of the tenth century. When steering for the coast of\r\nIndia, from the Maldives, Ibn Batuta was carried by the south-west\r\nmonsoon towards the northern portion of Ceylon, which was then (A.D.\r\n1347) in the hands of the Malabars, the Singhalese sovereign having\r\nremoved his capital southward to Gampola. The Hindu chief of Jaffna was\r\nat this time in possession of a fleet in \"which he occasionally\r\ntransported his troops against the Mahometans on other parts of the\r\ncoast;\" where the Singhalese chroniclers relate that the Tamils at this\r\ntime had erected forts at Colombo, Negombo, and Chilaw.\r\n\r\nIbn Batuta was permitted to land at Battala (Putlam) and found the shore\r\ncovered with \"cinnamon wood,\" which \"the merchants of Malabar transport\r\nwithout any other price than a few articles of clothing which are given\r\nas presents to the king. This may be attributed to the circumstance that\r\nit is brought down by the mountain torrents, and left in great heaps\r\nupon the shore.\"\r\n\r\nThis passage is interesting, though not devoid of obscurity, for\r\ncinnamon is not known to grow farther north than Chilaw, nor is there\r\nany river in the district of Putlam which could bear the designation of\r\na \"mountain torrent.\" Along the coast further south the cinnamon\r\ndistrict commences, and the current of the sea may have possibly carried\r\nwith it the uprooted laurels described in the narrative. The whole\r\npassage, however, demonstrates that at that time, at least, Ceylon had\r\nno organised trade in the spice.\r\n\r\nThe Tamil chieftain exhibited to Ibn Batuta his wealth in \"pearls,\" and\r\nunder his protection he made the pilgrimage to the summit of Adam's Peak\r\naccompanied by four jyogees who visited the foot-mark every year, \"four\r\nBrahmans, and ten of the king's companions, with fifteen attendants\r\ncarrying provisions.\" The first day he crossed a river, (the estuary of\r\nCalpentyn?) on a boat made of reeds, and entered the city of Manar\r\nMandali; probably the site of the present Minneri Mundal. This was the\r\n\"extremity of the territory of the infidel king,\" whence Ibn Batuta\r\nproceeded to the port of Salawat (Chilaw), and thence (turning inland)\r\nhe reached the city of the Singhalese sovereign at Gampola, then called\r\nGanga-sri-pura, which he contracts into Kankar or Ganga.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: As he afterwards writes, Galle \"Kale.\"]\r\n\r\nHe describes accurately the situation of the ancient capital, in a\r\nvalley between two hills, upon a bend of the river called, \"the estuary\r\nof rubies.\" The emperor he names \"Kina,\" a term I am unable to explain,\r\nas the prince who then reigned was probably Bhuwaneka-bahu IV., the\r\nfirst Singhalese monarch who held his court at Gampola.\r\n\r\nThe king on feast days rode on a white elephant, his head adorned with\r\nvery large rubies, which are found in his country, imbedded in \"a white\r\nstone abounding in fissures, from which they cut it out and give it to\r\nthe polishers.\" Ibn Batuta enumerates three varieties, \"the red, the\r\nyellow, and the cornelian;\" but the last must mean the sapphire, the\r\nsecond the topaz; and the first refers, I apprehend, to the amethyst;\r\nfor in the following passage, in describing the decorations of the head\r\nof the white elephant, he speaks of \"seven rubies, each of which was\r\nlarger than a hen's egg,\" and a saucer made of a ruby as broad as the\r\npalm of the hand.\r\n\r\nIn the ascent from Gampola to Adam's Peak, he speaks of the monkeys with\r\nbeards like a man (_Presbytes ursinus_, or _P. cephalopterus_), and of\r\nthe \"fierce leech,\" which lurks in the trees and damp grass, and springs\r\non the passers by. He describes the trees with leaves that never fall,\r\nand the \"red roses\" of the rhododendrons which still characterise that\r\nlofty region. At the foot of the last pinnacle which crowns the summit\r\nof the peak, he found a minaret named after Alexander the Great[1];\r\nsteps hewn out of the rock, and \"iron pins to which chains are appended\"\r\nto assist the pilgrims in their ascent; a well filled with fish, and\r\nlast of all, on the loftiest point of the mountain, the sacred\r\nfoot-print of the First Man, into the hollow of which the pilgrims drop\r\ntheir offerings of gems and gold.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In oriental tradition, Alexander is believed to have\r\nvisited Ceylon in company with the \"philosopher Bolinus,\" by whom De\r\nSacy believes that the Arabs meant Apollonius of Tyana. There is a\r\nPersian poem by ASHREP, the _Zaffer Namah Skendari_, which describes the\r\nconqueror's voyage to Serendib, and his devotions at the foot-mark of\r\nAdam, for reaching which, he and Bolinus caused steps to be hewn in the\r\nrock, and the ascent secured by rivets and chains.--See OUSELEY'S\r\n_Travels_, vol. i. p. 58. ]\r\n\r\nIn descending the mountain, Ibn Batuta passed through the village of\r\nKalanga, near which was a tomb, said to be that of Abu Abd Allah Ibn\r\nKhalif[1]; he visited the temple of Dinaur (Devi-Neuera, or Dondera\r\nHead), and returned to Putlam by way of Kale (Galle), and Kolambu\r\n(Colombo), \"the finest and largest city in Serendib.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Abu Abd Allah was the first who led the Mahometan pilgrims\r\nto Ceylon. The tomb alluded to was probably a _cenotaph_ in his honour;\r\nas Ibn Batuta had previously visited his tomb at Shiraz.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nCEYLON AS KNOWN TO THE CHINESE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the intimate knowledge of Ceylon acquired by the Chinese at an\r\nearly period, is distinctly ascribable to the sympathy and intercourse\r\npromoted by community of religion, there is traditional, if not\r\nhistorical evidence that its origin, in a remote age, may be traced to\r\nthe love of gain and their eagerness for the extension of commerce. The\r\nSinghalese ambassadors who arrived at Rome in the reign of the Emperor\r\nClandius, stated that their ancestors had reached China by traversing\r\nIndia and the Himalayan mountains long before ships had attempted the\r\nvoyage by sea[1], and as late as the fifth century of the Christian era,\r\nthe King of Ceylon[2], in an address delivered by his envoy to the\r\nEmperor of China, shows that both routes were then in use.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: PLINY, b. vi. ch. xxiv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Maha Naama, A.D. 428; _Sung-shoo_, a \"History of the\r\nNorthern Sung Dynasty,\" b. xcvii, p. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: It was probably the knowledge of the overland route that\r\nled the Chinese to establish their military colonies in Kashgar,\r\nYarkhand and the countries lying between their own frontier and the\r\nnorth-east boundary of India.--_Journ. Asiat._ 1. vi. p. 343. An embassy\r\nfrom China to Ceylon, A.D. 607, was entrusted to _Chang-Tsuen_,\r\n\"Director of the Military Lands.\"--_Suy-shoo_; b. lxxxi. p. 3.]\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, till after the third century of the Christian era\r\nthat we find authentic records of such journeys in the literature of\r\nChina. The Buddhist pilgrims, who at that time resorted to India,\r\npublished on their return itineraries and descriptions of the distant\r\ncountries they had visited, and officers, both military and civil,\r\nbrought back memoirs and statistical statements for the information of\r\nthe government and the guidance of commerce.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: REINAUD, _Mémoir sur l'Inde_, p. 9. STANISLAS JULIEN,\r\npreface to his translation of _Hiouen-Thsang_, Paris, 1853, p. 1. A\r\nbibliographical notice of the most important Chinese works which contain\r\ndescriptions of India, by M.S. JULIEN, will be found in the _Journ.\r\nAsiat._ for October, 1832, p. 264.]\r\n\r\nIt was reasonable to anticipate that in such records information would\r\nbe found regarding the condition of Ceylon as it presented itself from\r\ntime to time to the eyes of the Chinese; but unfortunately numbers of\r\nthe original works have long since perished, or exist only in extracts\r\npreserved in dynastic histories and encyclopædias, or in a class of\r\nbooks almost peculiar to China, called \"tsung-shoo,\" consisting of\r\nexcerpts reproduced from the most ancient writers. M. Stanislas Julien\r\ndiscovered in the _Pien-i-tien_, (\"a History of Foreign Nations,\" of\r\nwhich there is a copy in the Imperial Library of Paris,) a collection of\r\nfragments from Chinese authors who had treated of Ceylon; but as the\r\nintention of that eminent Sinologue to translate them[1] has not yet\r\nbeen carried into effect, they are not available to me for consultation.\r\nIn this difficulty I turned for assistance to China; and through the\r\nassiduous kindness of Mr. Wylie, of the London Mission at Shanghai, I\r\nhave received extracts from twenty-four Chinese writers between the\r\nfifth and eighteenth centuries, from which and from translations of\r\nChinese travels and topographies made by Remusat, Klaproth, Landresse,\r\nPauthier, Stanislas Julien, and others, I have been enabled to collect\r\nthe following facts relative to the knowledge of Ceylon possessed by the\r\nChinese in the middle ages.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Journ.

From the resort of these dealers, the inhabitants of other\r\ncountries, hearing of the attractions of the island, resorted to it in\r\nlarge numbers, and thus eventually a great kingdom was formed.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Wan-hëen tung-kaou_, b. cccxxxviii. p. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Yakkhos and Nagas (\"devils\" and \"serpents\") of the\r\n_Mahawanso_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Fo[)e]-Kou[)e] Ki_, ch. xxxviii. p. 333.

Asiat._\r\nfor July, 1836, tom. xxix. p. 36.]\r\n\r\nThe Chinese were aware of two separate races, one occupying the northern\r\nand the other the southern extremity of the island, and were struck with\r\nthe resemblance of the Tamils to the Hoo, a people of Central Asia, and\r\nof the Singhalese to the Leaou, a mountain tribe of Western China.[1]\r\nThe latter they describe as having \"large ears, long eyes, purple faces,\r\nblack bodies, moist and strong hands and feet, and living to one hundred\r\nyears and upwards.[2] Their hair was worn long and flowing, not only by\r\nthe women but by the men.\" In these details there are particulars that\r\nclosely resemble the description of the natives of the island visited by\r\nJambulus, as related in the story told by Diodorus.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Too-Hiouen_, quoted in the _Tung-tëen_, b. cxciii. p. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Taou-e ché-lë[)o]_, quoted in the _Hae-kw[)o]-too ché_, or\r\n\"Foreign Geography,\" b. xviii p. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: DIODORUS SICULUS, lib. ii. ch. liii. See _ante_, Vol. I. P.\r\nv. ch. 1. p. 153.]\r\n\r\nThe Chinese in the seventh century found the Singhalese dressed in a\r\ncostume which appears to be nearly identical with that of the present\r\nday.[1] Both males and females had their hair long and flowing, but the\r\nheads of children were closely shaven, a practice which still partially\r\nprevails. The jackets of the girls were occasionally ornamented with\r\ngems.[2] \"The men,\" says the _Tung-tëen_, \"have the upper part of the\r\nbody naked, but cover their limbs with a cloth, called _Kan-man,_ made\r\nof _Koo-pei_, 'Cotton,' a word in which we may recognise the term\r\n'Comboy,' used to designate the cotton cloth universally worn at the\r\npresent day by the Singhalese of both sexes in the maritime\r\nprovinces.[3] For their vests, the kings and nobles made use of a\r\nsubstance which is described as 'cloud cloth,'[4] probably from its\r\nbeing very transparent, and gathered (as is still the costume of the\r\nchiefs of Kandy) into very large folds. It was fastened with golden\r\ncord. Men of rank were decorated with earrings. The dead were burned,\r\nnot buried.\" And the following passage from the _S[)u]h-wan-hëen\r\ntung-kaou_, or the \"Supplement to Antiquarian Researches,\" is strikingly\r\ndescriptive of what may be constantly witnessed in Ceylon;--\"the females\r\nwho live near the family of the dead assemble in the house, beat their\r\nbreasts with both hands, howl and weep, which constitutes their\r\nappropriate rite.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Leang-shoo_, b. liv. p. 10; _Nan-shè_, b. lxxviii. pp. 13,\r\n14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Nan-shè_, A.D. 650, b. lxxviii. p. 13; _Leang-shoo_, A.D.\r\n670; b. liv. p. 11.

So remote was the age at which strangers frequented it, that in\r\nthe \"_Account of Island Foreigners,\"_ written by WANG-TA-YUEN[1] in the\r\nfourteenth century, it is stated that the origin of trade in the island\r\nwas coeval with the visit of Buddha, who, \"taking compassion on the\r\naborigines, who were poor and addicted to robbery, turned their\r\ndisposition to virtue, by sprinkling the land with sweet dew, which\r\ncaused it to produce red gems, and thus gave them wherewith to trade,\"\r\nand hence it became the resort of traders from every country.[2] Though\r\naware of the unsuitability of the climate to ripen wheat, the Chinese\r\nwere struck with admiration at the wonderful appliances of the\r\nSinghalese for irrigation, and the cultivation of rice.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Taou-e ché-lë[)o]_, quoted in the Foreign Geography, b.\r\nxviii. p. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The rapid peopling of Ceylon at a very remote age is\r\naccounted for in the following terms in a passage of MA-TWAN-LIN, as\r\ntranslated by M. Stanislas Julien;--\"Les habitants des autres royaumes\r\nentendirent parler de ce pays fortuné; c'est pourquoi ils y accoururent\r\nà l'envi.\"--_Journ.

Salang, to the north of Penang, lay in the direct course\r\nof the Chinese junks on their way to and from Ceylon, through the\r\nStraits of Malacca, and, in addition to its harbour, was attractive from\r\nits valuable mines of tin. Here the Chinese fleets called on both\r\nvoyages; and the fact of their resort is indicated by the popular name\r\n\"Ajung-Selan,\" or \"Junk-Ceylon;\" by which the place is still known,\r\n_Ajung_, in the language of the Malays, being the term for \"large\r\nshipping,\" and _Selan_, their name for Ceylon.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Tung-tëen_, A.D. 740, b. clxxxviii. p. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Sincapore Chronicle_, 1836.]\r\n\r\nThe port in Ceylon which the Chinese vessels made their rendezvous, was\r\nLo-le (Galle), \"where,\" it is said, \"ships anchor, and people land.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: WANG-KE, _Suh-wan-hëen tung-kaou_, b. ccxxxvi p. 19.]\r\n\r\nBesides rice, the vegetable productions of the island enumerated by the\r\nvarious Chinese authorities were aloes-wood, sandal-wood[1], and ebony;\r\ncamphor[2], areca-nuts, beans, sesamum, coco-nuts (and arrack distilled\r\nfrom the coco-nut palm) pepper, sugar-cane, myrrh, frankincense, oil and\r\ndrugs.[3] An odoriferous extract, called by the Chinese _Shoo-heang_, is\r\nlikewise particularised, but it is not possible now to identify it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The mention of sandal-wood is suggestive. It does not, so\r\nfar as I could ever learn, exist in Ceylon; yet it is mentioned with\r\nparticular care amongst its exports in the Chinese books. Can it be\r\nthat, like the calamander, or Coromandel-wood, which is rapidly\r\napproaching extinction, sandal-wood was extirpated from the island by\r\ninjudicious cutting, unaccompanied by any precautions for the\r\nreproduction of the tree?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Nan-shè_, b. lxxviii. p. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Suh-Hung keën-luh_, b. xlii. p. 52.]\r\n\r\nElephants and ivory were in request; and the only manufactures alluded\r\nto for export were woven cotton[1], gold ornaments, and jewelry;\r\nincluding models of the shrines in which were deposited the sacred\r\nrelics of Buddha.[2] Statues of Buddha were frequently sent as royal\r\npresents, and so great was the fame of Ceylon for their production in\r\nthe fourth and fifth centuries, that according to the historian of the\r\nWei Tartar dynasty, A.D. 386-556, people \"from the countries of Central\r\nAsia, and the kings of those nations, emulated each other in sending\r\nartisans to procure copies, but none could rival the productions of\r\nNan-té.[3] On standing about ten paces distant they appeared truly\r\nbrilliant, but the lineaments gradually disappeared on a nearer\r\napproach.\"[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Tsih-foo yuen-kwei_, A.D. 1012, b. dcccclxxi. p. 15. At a\r\nlater period \"Western cloth\" is mentioned among the exports of Ceylon,\r\nbut the reference must be to cloth previously imported either from India\r\nor Persia.--_Ming-she History of the Ming Dynasty,_ A.D. 1368--1643, b.\r\ncccxxvi. p. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A model of the shrine containing the sacred tooth was sent\r\nto the Emperor of China in the fifth century by the King of Ceylon;\r\n\"_Chacha Mo-ho-nan,\"_ a name which appears to coincide with Raja Maha\r\nNama, who reigned A.D. 410--433.--_Shunshoo_, A.D. 487, b. xlvii. p. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Nan-té was a Buddhist priest, who in the year A.D. 456 was\r\nsent on an embassy to the Emperor of China, and was made the bearer of\r\nthree statues of his own making.--_Ts[)i]h-foo yuen-kwei,_ b. li. p. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Wei-shoo,_ A.D. 590, b. cxiv. p. 9.]\r\n\r\nPearls, corals, and crystals were eagerly sought after; but of all\r\narticles the gems of Ceylon were in the greatest request. The business\r\nof collecting and selling them seems from the earliest time to have\r\nfallen into the hands of the Arabs, and hence they bore in China the\r\ndesignation of \"Mahometan stones.\"[1] They consisted of rubies,\r\nsapphires, amethysts, carbuncles (the \"red precious stone, the lustre of\r\nwhich serves instead of a lamp at night\")[2]; and topazes of four\r\ndistinct tints, \"those the colour of wine; the delicate tint of young\r\ngoslings, the deep amber, like bees'-wax, and the pale tinge resembling\r\nthe opening bud of the pine.\"[3] It will not fail to be observed that\r\nthroughout all these historical and topographical works of the Chinese,\r\nextending over a period of twelve centuries, from the year A.D. 487,\r\nthere is no mention whatever of _cinnamon_ as a production of Ceylon;\r\nalthough cassia, described under the name of kwei, is mentioned as\r\nindigenous in China and Cochin-China. In exchange for these commodities\r\nthe Chinese traders brought with them silk, variegated lute strings,\r\nblue porcelain, enamelled dishes and cups, and quantities of copper cash\r\nwanted for adjusting the balances of trade.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Tsih-ke,_ quoted in the Chinese _Mirror of Sciences,_ b.\r\nxxxiii. p. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Po-w[)u]h yaou-lan,_ b. xxxiii. p. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Ibid_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Suy-shoo_, \"History of the Suy Dynasty,\" A.D. 633, b.\r\nlxxxi. p. 3.]\r\n\r\nOf the religion of the people, the earliest account recorded by the\r\nChinese is that of F[)A] HIAN, in the fourth century[1], when Buddhism\r\nwas signally in the ascendant. But in the century which followed,\r\ntravellers returning from Ceylon brought back accounts of the growing\r\npower of the Tamils, and of the consequent eclipse of the national\r\nworship. The _Yung-tëen_ and the _Tae-ping_ describe at that early\r\nperiod the prevalence of Brahmanical customs, but coupled with \"greater\r\nreverence for the Buddhistical faith.\"[2] In process of time, however,\r\nthey are forced to admit the gradual decline of the latter, and the\r\nattachment of the Singhalese kings to the Hindu ritual, exhibiting an\r\nequal reverence to the ox and to the images of Buddha.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Fo[)e]-Kou[)e] Ki_, ch. xxxviii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Tae-ping_, b. dccxciii, p. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Woo-hë[)o]-pëen_, \"Records of the Ming Dynasty,\" b.\r\nlxviii. p. 4; _Tung-në[)e]_, b. cxcvi. pp. 79, 80.]\r\n\r\nThe Chinese trace to Ceylon the first foundation of monasteries, and of\r\ndwelling-houses for the priests, and in this they are corroborated by\r\nthe _Mahawanso_.[1] From these pious communities, the Emperors of China\r\nwere accustomed from time to time to solicit transcripts of theological\r\nworks[2], and their envoys, returning from such missions, appear to have\r\nbrought glowing accounts of the Singhalese temples, the costly shrines\r\nfor relics, and the fervid devotion of the people to the national\r\nworship.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xv. p. 99; ch. xx. p. 123.

The explanation\r\nis to be found in the identity of the national worship attracting as it\r\ndid the people of China to the sacred island, which had become the great\r\nmetropolis of their common faith, and to the sympathy and hospitality\r\nwith which the Singhalese welcomed the frequent visits of their distant\r\nco-religionists.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This is apparent from the fact that their statements are\r\nnot confined to descriptions of the customs and character of the male\r\nSinghalese, but exhibit internal evidence that they had been introduced\r\nto their families, and had had opportunities of noting peculiarities in\r\nthe customs of the females. They describe their dress, their mode of\r\ntying their hair, their treatment of infants and children, the fact that\r\nthe women as well as the men were addicted to chewing betel, and that\r\nthey did not sit down to meals with their husbands, but \"retired to some\r\nprivate apartments to eat their food.\"]\r\n\r\nThis interchange of courtesies was eagerly encouraged by the sovereigns\r\nof the two countries. The emperors of China were accustomed to send\r\nambassadors, both laymen and theologians, to obtain images and relics of\r\nBuddha, and to collect transcripts of the sacred books, which contained\r\nthe exposition of his doctrines[1];--and the kings of Ceylon despatched\r\nembassies in return, authorised to reciprocate these religious\r\nsympathies and do homage to the imperial majesty of China.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Hiouen-Thsang_, Introd. STANISLAS JULIEN, p. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe historical notices of the island by the Chinese relative to the\r\nperiod immediately preceding the fourteenth century, are meagre, and\r\nconfined to a native tradition that \"about 400 years after the\r\nestablishment of the kingdom, the Great Dynasty fell into decay, when\r\nthere was but one man of wisdom and virtue belonging to the royal house\r\nto whom the people became attached: the monarch thereupon caused him to\r\nbe thrown into prison; but the lock opened of its own accord, and the\r\nking thus satisfied of his sacred character did not venture to take his\r\nlife, but drove him into banishment to India (Tëen chuh), whence, after\r\nmarrying a royal princess, he was recalled to Ceylon on the death of the\r\ntyrant, where he reigned twenty years, and was succeeded by his son,\r\n_Po-kea Ta-To_.\"[l] In this story may probably be traced the extinction\r\nof the \"Great Dynasty\" of Ceylon, on the demise of Maha-Sen, and the\r\nsuccession of the Sulu-wanse, or Lower Dynasty, in the person of Kitsiri\r\nMaiwan, A.D. 301, whose son, Detu Tissa, may possibly be the _Po-kea\r\nTa-to_ of the Chinese Chronicle.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Leang-shoo_, \"History of the Leang Dynasty,\" b. liv. p.\r\n10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Mahawanso_, c. xxxvii. p 242. TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, &c., p.\r\n24.]\r\n\r\nThe visit of Fa Hian, the zealous Buddhist pilgrim, in the fifth century\r\nof our era, has been already frequently adverted to.[1] He landed in\r\nCeylon A.D. 412, and remained for two years at Anarajapoora, engaged in\r\ntranscribing the sacred books. Hence his descriptions are confined\r\nalmost exclusively to the capital; and he appears to have seen little of\r\nthe rest of the island. He dwells with delight on the magnificence of\r\nthe Buddhist buildings, the richness of their jewelled statues, and the\r\nprodigious dimensions of the dagobas, one of which, from its altitude\r\nand solidity, was called the \"_Mountain without fear_.\"[2] But what most\r\nexcited his admiration was his finding no less than 5000 Buddhist\r\npriests at the capital, 2000 in a single monastery on a mountain\r\n(probably Mihintala), and between 50,000 and 60,000 dispersed throughout\r\nthe rest of the island.[3] Pearls and gems were the wealth of Ceylon;\r\nand from the latter the king derived a royalty of three out of every ten\r\ndiscovered.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The _Fo[)e]-Kou[)e] Ki_, or \"Description of Buddhist\r\nKingdoms,\" by FA-HIAN, has been translated by Rémusat, and edited by\r\nKlaproth and Landresse, 4to.

The ultimate fate of\r\nthis renowned work of art is related in the _Leang-shoo,_ and several\r\nother of the Chinese chronicles. Throughout the | Tsin and Sung\r\ndynasties it was preserved in the Wa-kwan monastery at Nankin, along\r\nwith five other statues and three paintings which were esteemed\r\nchefs-d'oeuvre. The jade-stone image was at length destroyed in the time\r\nof Tung-hwan, of the Tse dynasty; first, the arm was broken off, and\r\neventually the body taken to make hair-pins and armlets for the\r\nemperor's favourite consort Pwan. _Nân-shè,_ b. lxxviii. p. 13.\r\n_Tung-tëen,_ b. cxciii. p. 8. _Tae-ping,_ &c., b. dcclxxxvii. p. 6.]\r\n\r\nDuring the same century there were four other embassies from Ceylon. One\r\nA.D. 428, when the King Cha-cha Mo-ho-nan (Raja Maha Naama) sent an\r\naddress to the emperor, which will be found in the history of the\r\nNorthern Sung dynasty[1], together with a \"model of the shrine of the\r\ntooth,\" as a token of fidelity;--two in A.D. 430 and A.D. 435; and a\r\nfourth A.D. 456, when five priests, of whom one was Nanté, the\r\ncelebrated sculptor, brought as a gift to the emperor a \"three-fold\r\nimage of Buddha.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Sung-shoo,_ A.D. 487, b. xcvii. p. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Probably one in each of the three orthodox\r\nattitudes,--sitting in meditation, standing to preach, and reposing in\r\n\"nirwana.\" _Wei-shoo,_ \"History of the Wei Tartar Dynasty,\" A.D. 590, b.\r\ncxiv. p. 9.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the Chinese annalists, the kings of Ceylon, in the sixth\r\ncentury, acknowledged themselves vassals of the Emperor of China, and in\r\nthe year 515, on the occasion of Kumara Das raising the chatta, an envoy\r\nwas despatched with tribute to China, together with an address,\r\nannouncing the royal accession, in which the king intimates that he \"had\r\nbeen desirous to go in person, but was deterred by fear of winds and\r\nwaves.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Leang-shoo,_ b. liv. p. 10. _Y[(u]h-hae,_ \"Ocean of Gems,\"\r\nA.D. 1331, b. clii. p. 33. The latter authority announces in like terms\r\ntwo other embassies with tribute to China, one in A.D. 523, and another\r\nin the reign of Kirti Sena, A.D. 527. The _Tsih-foo yuen-kwei_ mentions\r\na similar mission in A.D. 531, b. dcccclxviii. p. 20.]\r\n\r\nBut although all these embassies are recorded in the Chinese chronicles\r\nas so many instances of acknowledged subjection, there is every reason\r\nto believe that the magniloquent terms in which they are described are\r\nby no means to be taken in a literal sense, and that the offerings\r\nenumerated were merely in recognition of the privilege of commercial\r\nintercourse subsisting between the two nations: but as the Chinese\r\n_literati_ affect a lofty contempt for commerce, all allusion to trade\r\nis omitted; and beyond an incidental remark in some works of secondary\r\nimportance, the literature of China observes a dignified silence on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nOnly one embassy is mentioned in the seventh century, when Dalu-piatissa\r\ndespatched \"a memorial and offerings of native productions;\"[1] but\r\nthere were four in the century following[2], after which there occurs an\r\ninterval of above five hundred years, during which the Chinese writers\r\nare singularly silent regarding Ceylon; but the Singhalese historians\r\nincidentally mention that swords and musical instruments were then\r\nimported from China, for the use of the native forces, and that Chinese\r\nsoldiers took service in the army of Prakrama III. A.D. 1266.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A.D. 670. _Ts[)i]h-foo yuen-kwei_, b. dcccclxx. p. 16. It\r\nwas in the early part of this century, during a period of intestine\r\ncommotion, when the native princes were overawed by the Malabars, that\r\n_Hiouen-Thsang_ met on the coast of India fugitives from Ceylon, from\r\nwhom he derived his information as to the internal condition of the\r\nisland, A.D. 629--633.

On the second occasion (A.D. 746) the\r\nking, who despatched the embassy, is described as sending as his envoy a\r\n\"Brahman priest, the anointed graduate of the threefold repository,\r\nbearing as offerings head-ornaments of gold, precious neck-pendants, a\r\ncopy of the great Prajna Sutra, and forty webs of fine cotton cloth.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See the _Kawia-sakara_, written about A.D. 1410.]\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the only records of\r\nintercourse relate to the occasional despatch of public officers by the\r\nemperor of China to collect gems and medical drugs, and on three\r\nsuccessive occasions during the earlier part of the Yuen dynasty, envoys\r\nwere empowered to negotiate the purchase of the sacred alms-dish of\r\nBuddha.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"In front of the image of Buddha there is a sacred bowl\r\nwhich is neither made of jade, nor copper, nor iron; it is of a purple\r\ncolour and glossy, and when struck it sounds like glass.

This statement of\r\nthe Chinese authorities corroborates the story told by MARCO POLO,\r\npossibly from personal knowledge, that \"the Grand Khan Kublai sent\r\nambassadors to Ceylon with a request that the king would yield to him\r\npossession of 'the great ruby' in return for the 'value of a\r\ncity.'\"--(_Travels,_ ch. xix.) The MS. of MARCO POLO, which contains the\r\nLatin version of his Travels, is deposited in the Imperial Library of\r\nParis, and it is remarkable that a passage in it, which seems to be\r\nwanting in the Italian and other MSS., confirms this account of the\r\nChinese annalists, and states that the alms-dish of Buddha was at length\r\nyielded by the King of Ceylon as a gift to Kublai Khan, and carried with\r\nsignal honour to China. MARCO POLO describes the scene as something\r\nwithin his own knowledge:--\"Quando autem magnus Kaan scivit quod isti\r\nambaxiatores redibant cum reliquis istis, et erant prope terram ubi ipse\r\ntune erat, scilicet in Cambalu (Pekin), fecit mitti bandum quod omnes de\r\nterra obviarent reliquis istis (quia credebat quod essent reliquiæ de\r\nAdam) et istud fuit A.D. 1284.\"]\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the fifteenth century was, however, signalised by an\r\noccurrence, the details of which throw light over the internal condition\r\nof the island, at a period regarding which the native historians are\r\nmore than usually obscure. At this time the glory of Buddhism had\r\ndeclined, and the political ascendency of the Tamils had enabled the\r\nBrahmans to taint the national worship by an infusion of Hindu\r\nobservances. The _Se-yih-ke foo-choo,_ or \"Description of Western\r\nCountries,\" says that in 1405 A.D. the reigning king, A-lee-koo-nae-wurh\r\n(Wijaya-bahu VI.), a native of Sollee, and \"an adherent of the heterodox\r\nfaith, so far from honouring Buddha, tyrannised over his followers.\"[1]\r\nHe maltreated strangers resorting to the island, and plundered their\r\nvessels, \"so that the envoys from other lands, in passing to and fro,\r\nwere much annoyed by him.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: B. xviii. p. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ming-she_, b. cccxxvi, p. 7.]\r\n\r\nIn that year a mission from China, sent with incense and offerings to\r\nthe shrine of the tooth, was insulted and waylaid, and with difficulty\r\neffected an escape from Ceylon.[1] According to the _Ming-she_, or\r\nHistory of the Ming Dynasty, \"the Emperor _Ching-tsoo_, indignant at\r\nthis outrage on his people; and apprehensive lest the influence of China\r\nin other countries besides Ceylon had declined during the reign of his\r\npredecessors, sent _Ching-Ho_, a soldier of distinction, with a fleet of\r\nsixty-two ships and a large military escort, on an expedition to visit\r\nthe western kingdoms, furnished with proper credentials and rich\r\npresents of silk and gold. Ching-Ho touched at Cochin-China, Sumatra,\r\nJava, Cambodia, Siam, and other places, proclaiming at each the\r\nImperial edict, and conferring Imperial gifts.\" If any of the princes\r\nrefused submission, they were subdued by force; and the expedition\r\nreturned to China in A.D. 1407, accompanied by envoys from the several\r\nnations, who came to pay court to the Emperor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Se-y[)i]h-ke foo-choo_, b. xviii. p. 15. This Chinese\r\ninvasion of Ceylon has been already adverted to in the sketch of the\r\ndomestic history of the island, Vol. I. Part IV. ch xii. p. 417.]\r\n\r\nIn the following year Ching-Ho, having been despatched on a similar\r\nmission to Ceylon, the king, A-lee-ko-nae-wah, decoyed his party into\r\nthe interior, threw up stockades with a view to their capture, in the\r\nhope of a ransom, and ordered soldiers to the coast to plunder the\r\nChinese junks. But Ching-Ho, by a dexterous movement, avoided the\r\nattack, and invested the capital[1], made a prisoner of the king,\r\nsucceeded in conveying him on board his fleet, and carried him captive\r\nto China, together with his queen, his children, his officers of state,\r\nand his attendants. He brought away with him spoils, which were long\r\nafterwards exhibited in the Tsing-hae monastery at Nankin[2], and one of\r\nthe commentaries on the _Si-yu-ke_ of Hiouen Thseng, states that amongst\r\nthe articles carried away, was the sacred tooth of Buddha.[3] \"In the\r\nsixth month of the year 1411,\" says the author of the _Ming-Shè_, \"the\r\nprisoners were presented at court. The Chinese ministers pressed for\r\ntheir execution, but the emperor, in pity for their ignorance, set them\r\nat liberty, but commanded them to select a virtuous man from the same\r\nfamily to occupy the throne. All the captives declared in favour of\r\nSeay-pa-nae-na, whereupon an envoy was sent with a seal to invest him\r\nwith the royal dignity, as a vassal of the empire,\" and in that capacity\r\nhe was restored to Ceylon, the former king being at the same time sent\r\nback to the island.[4] It would be difficult to identify the names in\r\nthis story with the kings of the period, were it not stated in another\r\nchronicle, the _Woo-hë[)o]-pëen_, or Record of the Ming Dynasty, that\r\nSeay-pa-nae-na was afterwards named _Pu-la-ko-ma Ba-zae La-cha_, in\r\nwhich it is not difficult to recognise \"Sri Prakrama Bahu Raja,\" the\r\nsixth of his name, who transferred the seat of government from Gampola\r\nto Cotta, and reigned from A.D. 1410 to 1462.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Gampola.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _S[)u]h-Wan-hëen tung-kaou_, book ccxxxvi p. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See note at the end of this chapter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Ming-shè,_ b. cccxxvi. p. 5.

In anticipation of its publication, M.

It contains, however, no additional facts\r\nor statements beyond the questionable one before alluded to, that the\r\nsacred tooth of Buddha was amongst the spoils carried to Pekin by Ching\r\nHo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Woo-hë[)o]-pëen_, b. lxviii p. 5.

In the very\r\nimperfect version of the _Rajavali_, published by Upham, this important\r\npassage is rendered unintelligible by the want of fidelity of the\r\ntranslator, who has transformed the conqueror into a \"Malabar,\" and\r\nante-dated the event by a century. (_Rajavali_, p. 263.) I am indebted\r\nto Mr. De Alwis, of Colombo, for a correct translation of the original,\r\nwhich is as follows: \"In the reign of King Wijayo-bahu, the King of Maha\r\n(great) China landed in Ceylon with an army, pretending that he was\r\nbringing tribute; King Wijayo-bahu, believing his professions (because\r\nit had been customary in the time of King Prakrama-bahu for foreign\r\ncountries to pay tribute to Ceylon), acted incautiously, and he was\r\ntreacherously taken prisoner by the foreign king. His four brothers were\r\nkilled, and with them fell many people, and the king himself was carried\r\ncaptive to China.\" DE COUTO, in his continuation of DE BARROS, has\r\nintroduced the story of the capture of the king by the Chinese; but he\r\nhas confounded the dates, mystified the facts, and altered the name of\r\nthe new sovereign to Pandar, which is probably only a corruption of the\r\nSinghalese _Banda_, \"a prince.\"--DE COUTO, _Asia, &c_., dec. v. lib. i.\r\nc. vi. vol. ii. part i. p. 51.

The adventures of Ching Ho, in\r\nhis embassy to the nations of the Southern Ocean, have been made the\r\nground-work of a novel, the _Se-yung-ke_, which contains an enlarged\r\naccount of his exploits in Ceylon; but fact is so overlaid with fiction\r\nthat the passages are not worth extracting.]\r\n\r\nFor fifty years after this untoward event the subjection of Ceylon to\r\nChina appears to have been humbly and periodically acknowledged; tribute\r\nwas punctually paid to the emperor, and on two occasions, in 1416 A.D.,\r\nand 1421 A.D., the kings of Ceylon were the bearers of it in person.[1]\r\nIn 1430 A.D., at a period of intestine commotion, \"Ching-Ho issued a\r\nproclamation for the pacification of Ceylon,\" and, at a somewhat later\r\nperiod, edicts were promulgated by the Emperor of China for the\r\ngovernment of the island.[2] In 1459 A.D., however, the series of\r\nhumiliations appears to have come abruptly to a close; for, \"in that\r\nyear,\" says the _Ming-shè_, \"the King of Ceylon for the last time sent\r\nan envoy with tribute, and after that none ever came again.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ming-shè_, b. vii. pp. 4, 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid_., b. cccxxvii. p. 7.]\r\n\r\nOn their arrival in Ceylon early in the sixteenth century[1], the\r\nPortuguese found many evidences still existing of the intercourse and\r\ninfluence of the Chinese. They learned that at a former period they had\r\nestablished themselves in the south of the island; and both De Barros\r\nand De Couto ventured to state that the Singhalese were so called from\r\nthe inter-marriage of the Chinese with the Gallas or Chalias, the caste\r\nwho in great numbers still inhabit the country to the north of Point de\r\nGalle.[2] But the conjecture is erroneous, the derivation of Singhala is\r\nclearly traced to the Sanskrit \"_Singha_;\" besides which, in the\r\nalphabet of the Singhalese, _n_ and _g_ combine to form a single and\r\ninsoluble letter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A.D. 1565.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"Serem os Chijis senhores da costa Choromandel, parte do\r\nMalabar e desta Ilha Ceilão.

The country is characterised by much rain and constant\r\nthunder. The hills and valleys are beautifully ornamented with flowers\r\nand trees of great variety and beauty, the cries of the animals\r\nrejoicing together fill the air with gladness, and the landscape abounds\r\nwith splendour. In the forests are many elephants, and the natives use\r\nthem instead of draught oxen or horses. The people are all of the\r\nBuddhistic religion; it is said that Buddha was born here: he was born\r\nwith an excessive number of teeth. The grain is not sufficient for the\r\ninhabitants, and they depend for food on the various districts of India.\r\nGems are found in the hills, and pearls on the sea coast; the cinnamon\r\nthat is produced in the country is excellent, and much superior to that\r\nof Kwang-se. In the middle of the Ming dynasty, the Portuguese seized\r\nupon Se[)i]h-lan and established marts on the sea coast, which by\r\nschemes the Hollanders took from them. In the first year of Kia-King\r\n(1795), the English drove out the Hollanders and took possession of the\r\nsea coast. At this time the people of Se[)i]h-lan, on account of their\r\nvarious calamities or invasions, lost heart. Their city on the coast,\r\ncalled Colombo, was attacked by the English, and the inhabitants were\r\ndispersed or driven away; then the whole island fell into the hands of\r\nthe English, who eventually subjected it. The harbour for rendezvous on\r\nthe coast is called Ting-ko-ma-lé.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the Chinese commentator adds, on the authority of a work, from\r\nwhich he quotes, entitled, \"A Treatise on the Diseases of all the\r\nKingdoms of the Earth:\"--\r\n\r\n\"The Kingdom of Se[)i]h-lan was anciently called Lang-ya-sew; the\r\npassage from Soo-mun-ta-che (Sumatra), with a favourable wind, is twelve\r\ndays and nights; the country is extensive, and the people numerous, and\r\nthe products abundant, but inferior to Kiva-wa (Java). In the centre are\r\nlofty mountains, which yield the A-k[)u]h (crow and pigeon) gems; after\r\nevery storm of rain they are washed down from the hills, and gathered\r\namong the sand. From Chang-tsun, Lin-yih in the extreme west, can be\r\nseen. In the foreign language, the high mountain is called Se[)i]h-lan;\r\nhence the name of the island. It is said Buddha (Sh[)i]h-ka) came from\r\nthe island of Ka-lon (the gardens of Buddha), and ascended this\r\nmountain, on which remains the trace of his foot. Below the hill there\r\nis a monastery, in which they preserve the nëe-pwan (a Buddhistic\r\nphrase, signifying the world; literally rendered, his defiling or\r\ndefiled vessel) and the Shay-le-tsze, or relics of Buddha.\r\n\r\n\"In the sixth year of his reign (1407), Yung-l[)o], of the Ming dynasty,\r\nsent an ambassador extraordinary, Ching-Ho and others, to transmit the\r\nImperial mandate to the King A-l[)e]e-j[)o]-nai-wah, ordering him to\r\npresent numerous and valuable offerings and banners to the monastery,\r\nand to erect a stone tablet, and rewarding him by his appointment as\r\ntribute bearer; A-l[)e]e-j[)o]-nai-wurh ungratefully refusing to comply,\r\nthey seized him, in order to bring him to terms, and chose from among\r\nhis nearest of kin A-pa-nae-na, and set him on the throne. For fourteen\r\nyears, Tëen-ching, Kwa-wa (Java), Mwan-che-kea, Soo-mun-ta-che\r\n(Sumatra), and other countries, sent tribute in the tenth year of\r\nChin-tung, and the third year of Teen-shun they again sent tribute.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There is here some confusion in the chronology; as\r\nTeen-shun reigned before Ching-tung.]\r\n\r\n\"I have heard from an American, A-pe-le[1], that Se[)i]h-lan was the\r\noriginal country of Teen-chuh (India), and that which is now called\r\nWoo-yin-too was Teen-ch[)u]h, but in the course of time the names have\r\nbecome confused. According to the records of the later Han dynasty,\r\nTeen-ch[)u]h was considered the Shin-t[)u]h, and that the name is not\r\nthat of an island, but of the whole country. I do not know what proof\r\nthere is for A-pe-le's statement.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Abeel, an American missionary.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\nCEYLON AS KNOWN TO THE MOORS, GENOESE, AND VENETIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rapid survey of the commerce of India during the middle ages, which\r\nit has been necessary to introduce into the preceding narrative, will\r\nalso serve to throw light on a subject hitherto but imperfectly\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of the many tribes which inhabit Ceylon are the\r\nMahometans, or, as they are generally called on the island, the\r\n\"Moor-men,\" energetic and industrious communities of whom are found on\r\nall parts of the coast, but whose origin, adventures, and arrival are\r\namongst the historical mysteries of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe meaningless designation of \"Moors,\" applied to them, is the generic\r\nterm by which it was customary at one time, in Europe, to describe a\r\nMahometan, from whatsoever country he came, as the word Gentoo[1] was\r\nformerly applied in England to the inhabitants of Hindustan, without\r\ndistinction of race. The practice probably originated from the Spaniards\r\nhaving given that name to the followers of the Prophet, who, traversing\r\nMorocco, overran the peninsula in the seventh and eighth centuries.[2]\r\nThe epithet was borrowed by the Portuguese, who, after their discovery\r\nof the passage by the Cape of Good Hope, bestowed it indiscriminately\r\nupon the Arabs and their descendants, whom, in the sixteenth century,\r\nthey found established as traders in every port on the Asian and African\r\ncoast, and whom they had good reason to regard as their most formidable\r\ncompetitors for the commerce of the East.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The practice originated with the Portuguese, who applied to\r\nany unconverted native of India the term _gentio_, \"idolator\" or\r\n\"barbarian.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Spanish word \"_Moro_\" and the Portuguese, \"_Mouro_\" may\r\nbe traced either to the \"Mauri,\" the ancient people of Mauritania, now\r\nMorocco, or to the modern name of \"Moghrib,\" by which the inhabitants,\r\nthe Moghribins, designate their country.]\r\n\r\nParticular events have been assumed as marking the probable date of\r\ntheir first appearance in Ceylon. Sir Alexander Johnston, on the\r\nauthority of a tradition current amongst their descendants, says, that\r\n\"the first Mahometans who settled there were driven from Arabia in the\r\nearly part of the eighth century, and established themselves at Jaffna,\r\nManaar, Koodramali, Putlam, Colombo, Barberyn, Point de Galle, and\r\nTrincomalie.\"[1] The Dutch authorities, on the other hand, hold that the\r\nMoors were Moslemin only by profession, that by birth they were\r\ndescendants of a mean and detestable Malabar caste, who in remote times\r\nhad been converted to Islam through intercourse with the Arabs of\r\nBassora and the Red Sea; that they had frequented the coasts of India as\r\nseamen, and then infested them as pirates; and that their first\r\nappearance in Ceylon was not earlier than the century preceding the\r\nlanding of the Portuguese.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Trans. Roy. Asiat. Society_, 1827, A.D. vol. i. 538. The\r\nMoors, who were the informants of Sir Alexander Johnston, probably spoke\r\non the equivocal authority of the _Tohfut-ul-mujahideen_, which is\r\ngenerally, but erroneously, described as a narrative of the settlement\r\nof the Mahometans in Malabar. Its second chapter gives an account of\r\n\"the manner in which the Mahometan religion was first propagated\" there;\r\nand states that its earliest apostles were a Sheikh and his companions,\r\nwho touched at Cranganore about 822 A.D., when on their journey as\r\npilgrims to the sacred foot-print on Adam's Peak. (ROWLANDSON, _Orient.\r\nTransl. Fund_, pp. 47. 55.) But the introduction of the new faith into\r\nthis part of India was subsequent to the arrival of the Arabs\r\nthemselves, who had long before formed establishments at numerous places\r\non the coast.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: VALENTYN, ch. xv. p. 214.]\r\n\r\nThe truth, however, is, that there were Arabs in Ceylon ages before the\r\nearliest date named in these conjectures[1]; they were known there as\r\ntraders centuries before Mahomet was born, and such was their passion\r\nfor enterprise, that at one and the same moment they were pursuing\r\ncommerce in the Indian Ocean[2], and manning the galleys of Marc Antony\r\nin the fatal sea-fight at Actium.[3] The author of the _Periplus_ found\r\nthem in Ceylon about the first Christian century, Cosmas Indico-pleustes\r\nin the sixth; and they had become so numerous in China in the eighth, as\r\nto cause a tumult at Canton.[4] From the tenth till the fifteenth\r\ncentury, the Arabs, as merchants, were the undisputed masters of the\r\nEast; they formed commercial establishments in every country that had\r\nproductions to export, and their vessels sailed between every sea-port\r\nfrom Sofala to Bab-el-Mandeb, and from Aden to Sumatra.[5] The \"Moors,\"\r\nwho at the present day inhabit the coasts of Ceylon, are the descendants\r\nof these active adventurers; they are not purely Arabs in blood, but\r\ndescendants from Arabian ancestors by intermarriage with the native\r\nraces who embraced the religion of the Prophet.[6] The Singhalese\r\nepithet of \"_Marak-kala-minisu_\" or \"Mariners,\" describes at once their\r\norigin and occupation; but during the middle ages, when Ceylon was the\r\nTyre of Asia, these immigrant traders became traders in all the products\r\nof the island, and the brokers through whose hands they passed in\r\nexchange for the wares of foreign countries. At no period were they\r\neither manufacturers or producers in any department; their genius was\r\npurely commercial, and their attention was exclusively devoted to buying\r\nand selling what had been previously produced by the industry and\r\ningenuity of others. They were dealers in jewelry, connoisseurs in gems,\r\nand collectors of pearls; and whilst the contented and apathetic\r\nSinghalese in the villages and forests of the interior passed their\r\nlives in the cultivation of their rice-lands, and sought no other\r\nexcitement than the pomp and ceremonial of their temples; the busy and\r\nambitious Mahometans on the coast built their warehouses at the ports,\r\ncrowded the harbours with their shipping, and collected the wealth and\r\nluxuries of the island, its precious stones, its dye-woods, its spices\r\nand ivory, to be forwarded to China and the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: MOUNTSTUART ELPHINSTONE, on the authority of Agatharchidos\r\n(as quoted by Diodorus and Photius), says, that \"from all that appears\r\nin that author, we should conclude that two centuries before the\r\nChristian era, the trade (between India and the ports of Sabæa) was\r\nentirely in the hands of the Arabs.\"--_Hist. India_, b. iii. c. x. p.\r\n167.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Pliny, b. vi. c. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3:\r\n\r\n          \"Omnis eo terrore Ægyptus et Indi\r\n  Omnes Arabes vertebant terga Sabæi.\"\r\n\r\nVIRGIL, _Æn._ viii. 705.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: ABOU-ZEYD, vol. i. p. xlii. cix.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: VINCENT, vol. ii. p. 451. The Moors of Ceylon are identical\r\nin race with \"the Mopillees of the Malabar coast.\"--McKENZIE, _Asiat.\r\nRes._, vol. vi. p. 430.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: In a former work, \"_Christianity in Ceylon_,\" I was led, by\r\nincorrect information, to describe a section of the Moors as belonging\r\nto the sect of the Shiahs, and using the Persian language in the service\r\nof their mosques (c. i. note, p. 34). There is reason to believe that at\r\na former period there were Mahometans in Ceylon to whom this description\r\nwould apply; but at the present day the Moors throughout the island are,\r\nI believe, universally Sonnees, belonging to one of the four orthodox\r\nsects called _Shafees_, and using Arabic as their ritual dialect. Their\r\nvernacular is Tamil, mixed with a number of Arabic words; and all their\r\nreligious books, except the Koran, are in that dialect. Casie Chitty,\r\nthe erudite District Judge of Chilaw, writes to me that \"the Moors of\r\nCeylon believe themselves to be of the posterity of Hashem; and,\r\naccording to one tradition, their progenitors were driven from Arabia by\r\nMahomet himself, as a punishment for their cowardice at the battle of\r\nOhod. But according to another version, they fled from the tyranny of\r\nthe Khalif Abu al Malek ben Merivan, in the early part of the eighth\r\ncentury. Their first settlement in India was formed at Kail-patam, to\r\nthe east of Cape Comorin, whence that place is still regarded as the\r\n'father-land of the Moors.'\"\r\n\r\nAnother of their traditions is, that their first landing-place in Ceylon\r\nwas at Barberyn, south of Caltura, in the 402nd year of the Hejira,\r\n(A.D. 1024.) These legends would seem to refer to the arrival of some\r\nimportant section of the Moors, but not to the first appearance of this\r\nremarkable people in Ceylon. The _Ceylon Gazetteer_, Cotta, 1834, p.\r\n254, contains a valuable paper by Casie Chitty on \"the Manners and\r\nCustoms of the Moors of Ceylon.\"]\r\n\r\nMARCO POLO, in the thirteenth century, found the Moors in uncontested\r\npossession of this busy and lucrative trade, and BARBOSA, in his account\r\nof the island, A.D. 1519, says, that not only were they to be found in\r\nevery sea-port and city, conducting and monopolising its commerce, but\r\nMoors from the coast of Malabar were continually arriving to swell their\r\nnumbers, allured by the facilities of commerce and the unrestrained\r\nfreedom enjoyed under the government.[1] In process of time their\r\nprosperity invested them with political influence, and in the decline of\r\nthe Singhalese monarchy they took advantage of the feebleness of the\r\nking of Cotta, to direct armed expeditions against parts of the coast,\r\nto plunder the inhabitants, and supply themselves with elephants and\r\npearls.[2] They engaged in conspiracies against the native princes; and\r\nWijayo Bahu VII., who was murdered in 1534, was slain by a turbulent\r\nMoorish leader called Soleyman, whom his eldest son and successor had\r\ninstigated to the crime.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Molti Mori Malabari vengono à stantiare in questa isola\r\nper esser in grandissima libertà, oltra tutte le commodita e delitie del\r\nmondo,\" etc.--ODOARDO BARBOSA, _Sommario delle Indie Orientale_, in\r\n_Ramusio_, vol. i. p. 313.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Rajavali_, p. 274.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Ib., p. 284. PORCACCHI, in his _Isolario_, written at\r\nVenice A.D. 1576, thus records the traditional reputation of the Moors\r\nof Ceylon:--\"I Mori ch' habitano hoggi la Taprobana fanno grandissimi\r\ntraffichi, nauigando per tutto: et piu anchora vengono da diverse parte\r\nmolte mercantie, massimamente dal paese di Cambaia, con coralli,\r\ncinabrio, et argento vivo. Ma son questi Mori perfidi et ammazzono\r\nspesse, volte i lor Re; et ne creano degli altri.\"--Page 188.]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the Portuguese in Ceylon at this critical period,\r\nserved not only to check the career of the Moors, but to extinguish the\r\nindependence of the native princes; and looking to the facility with\r\nwhich the former had previously superseded the Malabars, and were fast\r\nacquiring an ascendency over the Singhalese chiefs, it is not an\r\nunreasonable conjecture that, but for this timely appearance of a\r\nChristian power in the Island, Ceylon, instead of a possession of the\r\nBritish crown, might at the present day have been a Mahometan kingdom,\r\nunder the rule of some Arabian adventurer.\r\n\r\nBut although the position of the Arabs in relation to the commerce of\r\nthe East underwent no unfavourable change prior to the arrival of the\r\nPortuguese in the Indian seas, numerous circumstances combined in the\r\nearly part of the sixteenth century to bring other European nations into\r\ncommunication with the East.\r\n\r\nThe productions of India, whether they passed by the Oxus to the\r\nCaspian, or were transported in caravans from the Tigris to the shores\r\nof the Black Sea, were poured into the magazines of Constantinople, the\r\nmerchants of which, previous to the fall of the Lower Empire, were the\r\nmost opulent in the world. During the same period, Egypt commanded the\r\ntrade of the Red Sea; and received, through Aden, the luxuries of the\r\nfar East, with which she supplied the Moorish princes of Spain, and the\r\ncountries bordering on the Mediterranean.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: ODOARDO BARBOSA, In Ramusio, vol. i. p. 292. BALDELLI BONI,\r\n_Relazione dell' Europa e dell' Asia,_ lib. ix. ch. xlvii FARIA Y SOUSA;\r\n_Portug. Asia,_ part i. ch. viii.]\r\n\r\nEven when the dominion of the Khalifs was threatened by the rising power\r\nof the Turks, and long after the subsidence of the commotions and\r\nvicissitudes which marked the period of the Crusades, part of this\r\nlucrative commerce was still carried to Alexandria, by the Nile and its\r\ncanals. The Genoese and Venetians, each eager to engross the supply of\r\nEurope, sought permission from the Emperors to form establishments on\r\nthe shores of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The former advanced\r\ntheir fortified factories as far eastward as Tabriz, to meet the\r\ncaravans returning from the Persian Gulf[1], and the latter, in addition\r\nto the formation of settlements at Tyre, Beyrout, and Acre[2], acquired\r\nafter the fourth crusade, succeeded (in defiance of the interdict of the\r\nPopes against trading with the infidel) in negotiating a treaty with the\r\nMamelukes for a share in the trade of Alexandria.[3] It was through\r\nVenice that England and the western nations obtained the delicacies of\r\nIndia and China, down to the period when the overland route and the Red\r\nSea were deserted for the grander passage by the Cape of Good Hope.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: GIBBON, _Decl. and Fall,_ ch. lxiii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: DARU, _Hist. de Venise_ lib. xix. vol. iv. p. 74.\r\nMACPHERSON'S _Annals of Commerce,_ vol. i. p. 370.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: So impatient were the Venetians to grasp the trade of\r\nAlexandria that Marino Sanuto, about the year 1321 A.D., endeavoured to\r\nexcite a new crusade in order to wrest it from the Sultan of Egypt by\r\nforce of arms, _Secreta Fidelium Crucis,_ in BONGARS, _Gesta Dei per\r\nFrancos,_ Hanau, 1611.

The last of the Venetion\r\n\"argosies\" which reached the shores of England was cast away on the Isle\r\nof Wight, A.D. 1587.]\r\n\r\nAnother great event which stimulated the commercial activity of the\r\nItalians in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, was the\r\nextraordinary progress of the Mongols, who in an incredibly short space\r\nof time absorbed Central Asia into one powerful empire, overthrew the\r\nancient monarchy of China, penetrated to the heart of Russia, and\r\ndirected their arms with equal success both against Poland and Japan.\r\nThe popes and the sovereigns of Europe, alike alarmed for their\r\ndominions and their faith, despatched ambassadors to the Great Khan; the\r\nmission resulted in allaying apprehension for the further advance of\r\ntheir formidable neighbours towards the west, and the vigilant merchants\r\nof Venice addressed themselves to effect an opening for trade in the new\r\ndomains of the Tartar princes.\r\n\r\nIt is to this commercial enterprise that we are indebted for the first\r\nauthentic information regarding China and India, that reached Europe\r\nafter the silence of the middle ages; and the voyages of the Venetians,\r\nin some of which the realities of travel appear as extra-ordinary as the\r\nincidents of romance, contain accounts of Ceylon equally interesting and\r\nreliable.\r\n\r\nMARCO POLO, who left Venice as a youth, in the year 1271, and resided\r\nseventeen years at the court of Kubla Khan, was the first European who\r\npenetrated to China Proper; whence he embarked in A.D. 1291, at Fo-Kien,\r\nand passing through the Straits of Malacca, rested at Ceylon, on his\r\nhomeward route by Ormuz.\r\n\r\nHe does not name the port in Ceylon at which he landed, but he calls the\r\nking _Sender-naz,_ a name which may possibly be identified with the\r\nMalay Chandra-banu, who twice invaded the island during the reign of\r\nPandita Prakrama-bahu III.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pandita Prakrama Bahoo III. was also called Kalikalla\r\nSaahitya Sargwajnya,--TURNOUR'S _Epitome_, p. 44.]\r\n\r\nHe repeats the former exaggerated account as to the dimensions of\r\nCeylon; he says that it was believed to have been anciently larger\r\nstill, and he shows incidentally that as early as the thirteenth\r\ncentury, the Arab sailors possessed charts of the island which they used\r\nin navigating the Indian seas.[1] Then, as now, the universal costume of\r\nthe Singhalese was the cotton \"comboy,\" worn only on the lower half of\r\nthe body[2], their grains were sesamum and rice; their food the latter\r\nwith milk and flesh-meat; and their drink coco-nut toddy, which Marco\r\ncalls \"wine drawn from the trees.\" He dwells with rapture on the gems\r\nand costly stones, and, above all, on the great ruby, a span long, for\r\nwhich Kubla Khan offered the value of a city. With singular truth he\r\nsays, \"the people are averse to a military life, abject and timid, and\r\nwhen they have occasion to employ soldiers, they procure them from other\r\ncountries in the vicinity of the Mahometans.\" From this it would seem\r\nthat six hundred years ago, it was the practice in Ceylon, as it is at\r\nthe present day, to recruit the forces of the island from the Malays.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: I have seen with the sailors of the Maldives, who resort to\r\nCeylon at the present day, charts evidently copied from very ancient\r\noriginals.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See the drawing, page 612.]\r\n\r\nThe next Venetian whose travels qualified him to speak of Ceylon was the\r\nMinorite friar ODORIC, of Portenau in Friuli[1], who, setting out from\r\nthe Black Sea in 1318, traversed the Asian continent to China, and\r\nreturned to Italy after a journey of twelve years. In Ceylon he was\r\nstruck by the number of serpents, and the multitude of wild animals,\r\nlions (leopards?), bears, and elephants. \"In it he saw the mountain on\r\nwhich Adam for the space of 500 years mourned the death of Abel, and on\r\nwhich his tears and those of Eve formed, as men believed, a fountain;\"\r\nbut this Odoric discovered to be a delusion, as he saw the spring\r\ngushing from the earth, and its waters \"flowing over jewels, but\r\nabounding with leeches and blood-suckers.\" The natives were permitted by\r\nthe king to collect the gems; and in doing so they smear their bodies\r\nwith the juice of lemons to protect them from the leeches. The wild\r\ncreatures, they said, however dangerous to the inhabitants of the\r\nisland, were harmless to strangers. In that island Odoric saw \"birds\r\nwith two heads,\" which possibly implies that he saw the hornbill[2],\r\nwhose huge and double casque may explain the expression.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Itinerarium_ Fratris ODORICI de Foro Julii de\r\nPortu-Vahonis.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Buceros Pica_. See _ante_, Part II. ch. ii. p. 167.]\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding century[1] the most authentic account of Ceylon is\r\ngiven by NICOLO DI CONTI, another Venetian, who, though of noble family,\r\nhad settled as a merchant at Damascus, whence he had travelled over\r\nPersia, India, the Eastern Archipelago, and China. Returning by way of\r\nArabia and the Red Sea, in 1444, he fell into danger amongst some\r\nfanatical Mahometans, and was compelled to renounce the faith of a\r\nChristian, less from regard for his own safety than apprehension for\r\nthat of his children and wife. For this apostacy he besought the pardon\r\nof Pope Eugenius IV., who absolved him from guilt on condition that he\r\nshould recount his adventures to the apostolic secretary, Poggio\r\nBracciolini, by whom they have been preserved in his dissertation on\r\n\"_The Vicissitudes of Fortune_.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Among the writers on India in the 14th century, A.D. 1323,\r\nwas the Dominican missionary JOURDAIN CATALANI, or \"Jordan de Severac,\"\r\nregarding whose title of _Bishop of Colombo_, \"Episcopus Columbensis,\"\r\nit is somewhat uncertain whether his see was in Ceylon, or at Coulam\r\n(Quilon), on the Malabar coast. The probability in favour of the latter\r\nis sustained by the fact of the very limited accounts of the island\r\ncontained in his _Mirabilia_, a work in which he has recorded his\r\nobservations on the Dekkan. _Cinnamon he describes as a production of\r\nMalabar_, and Ceylon he extols only for its gems, pre-eminent among\r\nwhich were two rubies, one worn by the king, suspended round his neck,\r\nand the other which, when grasped in the hand could not be covered, by\r\nthe fingers, \"Non credo mundum habere universum tales duo lapides, nec\r\ntanti pretii.\" The MS. of Fra.

GIOVANNI DE MARIGNOLA, a Florentine and Legate of Clement VI.,\r\nlanded in Ceylon in 1349 A.D., at which time the legitimate king was\r\ndriven away and the supreme power left in the hands of a eunuch whom he\r\ncalls _Coja-Joan_, \"pessimus Saracenus.\" The legate's attention was\r\nchiefly directed to \"the mountain opposite Paradise.\"--DOBNER, _Monum.\r\nHistor.

An admirable\r\ntranslation of the narrative of DI CONTI has recently been made by R.H.\r\nMajor, Esq., for the Hakluyt Society. London, 1857.]\r\n\r\nDi Conti is, I believe, the first European who speaks of cinnamon as a\r\nproduction of Ceylon. \"It is a tree,\" he says, \"which grows there in\r\nabundance, and which very much resembles our thick willows, excepting\r\nthat the branches do not grow upwards, but spread horizontally; the\r\nleaves are like those of the laurel, but somewhat larger; the bark of\r\nthe branches is thinnest and best, that of the trunk thick and inferior\r\nin flavour. The fruit resembles the berries of the laurel; the Indians\r\nextract from it an odoriferous oil, and the wood, after the bark has\r\nbeen stripped from it, is used by them for fuel.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: POGGIO makes Nicolo di Conti say that the island contains a\r\nlake, in the middle of which is a city three miles in circumference; but\r\nthis is evidently an amplification of his own, borrowed from the passage\r\nin which Pliny (whom Poggio elsewhere quotes) alludes to the fabulous\r\nLake Megisba.--PLINY, lib. vi. ch. xxiv.]\r\n\r\nThe narrative of Di Conti, as it is printed by Ramusio, from a\r\nPortuguese version, contains a passage not found in Poggio, in which it\r\nis alleged that a river of Ceylon, called Arotan, has a fish somewhat\r\nlike the torpedo, but whose touch, instead of electrifying, produces a\r\nfever so long as it is held in the hand, relief being instantaneous on\r\nletting it go.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: DI CONTI in _Ramusio_, vol. i. p. 344. There are two other\r\nItalian travellers of this century who touched at Ceylon; one a\r\n\"GENTLEMAN OF FLORENCE,\" whose story is printed by Ramusio (but without\r\nthe author's name), who accompanied Vasco de Gama, in the year 1479, in\r\nhis voyage to Calicut, and who speaks of the trees \"che fanno la canella\r\nin molta perfettione.\"--Vol. i. p. 120. The other is GIROLAMO DI SANTO\r\nSTEFANO, a Genoese, who, in pursuit of commerce, made a journey to India\r\nwhich he described on his return in 1499, in a letter inserted by\r\nRamusio in his collection of voyages. He stayed but one day in the\r\nisland, and saw only its coco-nuts, jewels, and cinnamon.--Vol. i. p.\r\n345.]\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth century was prolific in navigators, the accounts of whose\r\nadventures served to diffuse throughout Europe a general knowledge of\r\nCeylon, at least as it was known superficially before the arrival of the\r\nPortuguese. Ludovico Barthema, or Varthema, a Bolognese[1], remained at\r\na port on the west coast[2] for some days in 1506. The four kings of the\r\nisland being busily engaged in civil war[3], he found it difficult to\r\nland, but he learned that permission to search for jewels at the foot of\r\nAdam's Peak might be obtained by the payment of five ducats, and\r\nrestoring as a royalty all gems over ten carats. Fruit was delicious and\r\nabundant, especially artichokes and oranges[4], but rice was so\r\ninsufficiently cultivated that the sovereigns of the island were\r\ndependent for their supplies upon the King of Narsingha, on the\r\ncontinent of India.[5] This statement of Barthema is without\r\nqualification; there can be little doubt that it applied chiefly to the\r\nsouthern parts of the island, and that the north was still able to\r\nproduce food sufficient for the wants of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Itinerario de_ LUDOVICO DE VARTHEMA, _Bolognese, no lo\r\nEgypto, ne la Suria, ne la Arabia Deserta e Felice, ne la Persia, ne la\r\nIndia, e ne la, Æthiopia--la fede el vivere e costume de tutte le\r\nprefatte provincie._ Roma. 1511, A.D.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Probably Colombo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: These conflicts and the actors in them are described in the\r\n_Rajavali_, p. 274.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"Carzofoli megliori che li nostri, melangoli dolci, li\r\nmegiiori credo, che siano nel mondo.\"--_Varthema_, pt. xxvii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: \"In questo paese non nasce riso; ma ne li viene da terra\r\nferma. Li re de quella isola sono tributarii d'il re de Narsinga per\r\nrepetto del riso.\"--_Itin_., pt. xxvii. See also BARBOSA, in _Ramusio_,\r\nvol. i p. 312.]\r\n\r\nBarthema found the supply of cinnamon small, and so precarious that the\r\ncutting took place but once in three years. The Singhalese were at that\r\ntime ignorant of the use of gunpowder[1], and their arms were swords and\r\nlance-heads mounted on shafts of bamboo; \"with these they fought, but\r\ntheir battles were not bloody.\" The Moors were in possession of the\r\ntrade, and the king sent a message to Varthema and his companions,\r\nexpressive of his desire to purchase their commodities; but in\r\nconsequence of a hint that payment would be regulated by the royal\r\ndiscretion, the Italians weighed anchor at nightfall and bade a sudden\r\nadieu to Ceylon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The _Rajavali_, p. 279, describes the wonder of the\r\nSinghalese on witnessing for the first time the discharge of a cannon by\r\nthe Portuguese who had landed at Colombo, A.D. 1517. \"A ball shot from\r\none of them, after flying some leagues, will break a castle of marble,\r\nor even of iron.\"]\r\n\r\nEarly in the sixteenth century, ODOARDO BARBOSA, a Portuguese captain,\r\nwho had sailed in the Indian seas, compiled a _summary_ of all that was\r\nthen known concerning the countries of the East[1], with which the\r\npeople of Portugal had been brought into connection by their recent\r\ndiscovery of the passage round the Cape of Good Hope. Writing partly\r\nfrom personal observation, but chiefly from information obtained from\r\nthe previous accounts of Di Conti, Barthema and Corsali[2], he speaks of\r\nthat \"grandest and most lovely island, which the Moors of Arabia,\r\nPersia, and Syria call Zeilam, but the Indians, _Tenarisim_, or the\r\n_land of delights_.\" Its ports were crowded with Moors, who monopolised\r\ncommerce, and its inhabitants, whose complexions were fair and their\r\nstature robust and stately, were altogether devoted to pleasure and\r\nindifferent to arms.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Il Sommario delle Inde Orientale di_ ODOARDO BARBOSA,\r\nLisbon, 1519. A sketch of the life of BARBOSA is given in CRAWFURD'S\r\n_Dictionary of the Indian Islands_, p. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Two letters written by ANDREA CORSALI, a Florentine, dated\r\nfrom Cochin, A.D. 1515, and addressed to the Grand Duke Julian de\r\nMedicis.]\r\n\r\nBarbosa appears to have associated chiefly with the Moors, whose\r\ncharacter and customs he describes almost as they exist at the present\r\nday. He speaks of their heads, covered with the finest handkerchiefs; of\r\ntheir ear-rings, so heavy with jewels that they hang down to their\r\nshoulders; of the upper parts of their bodies exposed, but the lower\r\nportions enveloped in silks and rich cloths, secured by an embroidered\r\ngirdle. He describes their language as a mixture of Arabic and Malabar,\r\nand states that numbers of their co-religionists from the Indian coast\r\nresorted constantly to Ceylon, and established themselves there as\r\ntraders, attracted by the delights of the climate, and the luxury and\r\nabundance of the island, but above all by the unlimited freedom which\r\nthey enjoyed under its government. The duration of life was longer in\r\nCeylon than in any country of India. With a profusion of fruits of every\r\nkind, and of animals fit for food, grain alone was deficient; rice was\r\nlargely imported from the Coromandel coast, and sugar from Bengal.\r\n\r\nDi Conti and Barthema had ascertained the existence of cinnamon as a\r\nproduction of the island, but Barbosa was the first European who\r\nasserted its superiority over that of all other countries. Elephants\r\ncaptured by order of the King, were tamed, trained, and sold to the\r\nprinces of India, whose agents arrived annually in quest of them. The\r\npearls of Manaar and the gems of Adam's Peak were the principal riches\r\nof Ceylon. The cats-eye, according to Barbosa, was as highly valued as\r\nthe ruby by the dealers in India; and the rubies themselves were\r\npreferred to those of Pegu on account of their density[1]; but, compared\r\nwith those of Ava, they were inferior in colour, a defect which the\r\nMoors were skilled in correcting by the of fire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: CESARE DE FREDERICI, a Venetian merchant, whose travels in\r\nIndia, A.D. 1563, have been translated by HICKOCKE, says of Zeilan,\r\nthat, \"they find there some rubies, but I have sold rubies well there\r\nthat I brought with me from Pegu.\"--In Hakluyt, vol. i. p. 226.]\r\n\r\nThe residence of the King was at \"Colmucho\" (Colombo), whither vessels\r\ncoming for elephants, cinnamon, and gems brought fine cloths from\r\nCambay, together with saffron, coral, quicksilver, vermilion, and\r\nspecie, and above all silver, which was more in demand than all the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nSuch is the sum of intelligence concerning Ceylon recorded by the\r\nGenoese and Venetians during the three centuries in which they were\r\nconversant with the commerce of India. Their interest in the island had\r\nbeen rendered paramount by the events of the first Crusades, but it was\r\nextinguished by the discovery of the passage round the Cape of Good\r\nHope. In the period which intervened the word _traveller_ may be said to\r\nhave been synonymous with merchant[1], and when the occupation of the\r\nlatter was withdrawn, the adventures of the other were suspended. The\r\nvessels of the strangers, in a very few years after their first\r\nappearance in the Indian seas, began to divert from its accustomed\r\nchannel, the stream of commerce which for so many ages had flowed in the\r\ndirection of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf; and the galleons of\r\nPortugal superseded the caravans of Arabia and the argosies of Venice.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: CÆSAR, FREDERICK opens the account of his wanderings in\r\nIndia, A.D. 1563, as follows:--\"Having for the space of eighteen years\r\ncontinually coasted and travelled in many countries beyond the Indies,\r\n_wherein I have had both good and ill success in my travels\"_ &c. He may\r\nbe regarded as the last of the merchant voyagers of Venice, His book was\r\ntranslated into English almost simultaneously with its appearance in\r\nItalian, under the title of \"_The Voyages and Travaile of M. Cæsar\r\nFredrick, Merchant of Venice, into the East Indies, and beyond the\r\nIndies,_ written at sea, in the Hercules of London, the 25th March,\r\n1588, and translated out of Italian by Mr. THOMAS HICKOCKE, Lond, 4to.\r\n1588.\" The author, who left Venice in 1563, crossed over from Cape\r\nComorin to Chilaw, to be present at the fishery of pearls, which he\r\ndescribes almost as it is practised at the present time. The divers\r\nengaged in it were all Christians (see _Christianity in Ceylon,_ ch. i.\r\np. 11), under the care of friars of the order of St. Paul. Colombo was\r\nthen a hold of the Portuguese, but without \"walles or enemies;\" and\r\nthence \"to see how they gather the sinnamon, or take it from the tree\r\nthat it groweth on (because the time that I was there, was the season\r\nthat they gather it, in the moneth of Aprill) I, to satisfie my desire,\r\nwent into a wood three miles from the citie, although in great danger,\r\nthe Portugals being in arms, and in the field with the king of the\r\ncountry.\" Here he gives with great accuracy the particulars of the\r\nprocess of peeling cinnamon, as it is still practised by the Chalias.]\r\n\r\nIn his dismay the Sultan of Egypt threatened to demolish the sacred\r\nremains of Jerusalem, should the infidels of Europe persist in\r\nannihilating the trade of the Desert. Stimulated by the Doge, he\r\nattacked the Portuguese merchantmen in the Indian seas, and destroyed a\r\nconvoy off the coast of Cochin; an outrage for which Albuquerque\r\nmeditated a splendid revenge by an expedition to plunder Mecca and\r\nMedina, and to consummate the desolation of Egypt by diverting the Nile\r\nto the Red Sea, across Nubia or Abyssinia![1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: DARU, _Hist, de Venise,_ lib. xix. p. 114.

Asia_, pt. i.\r\nch. viii. vol i. pp. 64, 83, 107, 137.]\r\n\r\nBut the catastrophe was inevitable; the rich freights of India and China\r\nwere carried round the \"Cape of Storms,\" and no longer slowly borne on\r\nthe Tigris and the Nile. The harbours of Ormus and of Bassora became\r\ndeserted; and on the shores of Asia Minor, where the commerce of Italy\r\nhad intrenched itself in castles of almost feudal pretension, the\r\nrivalries of Genoa and Venice were extinguished in the same calamitous\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF THE FIRST VOLUME.",
