(Edin.)\r\n\r\n               of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries\r\n\r\n            Author of _Common Weeds of the Farm and Garden_\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Cambridge:\r\n                        at the University Press\r\n                                  1917\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs in the case of a previous volume, _Common Weeds of the Farm and\r\nGarden_, the preparation of this handbook was undertaken because of the\r\ngreat lack of readily available and reliable information on the subject\r\nin English scientific literature. Many of the facts were known to a few\r\ninterested persons, but many others were so scattered here and there in\r\ntechnical reports and journals that they were scarcely known even to\r\nexpert chemists and botanists. The bringing of this information together\r\nin some sort of order has involved considerable labour extending over\r\nseveral years, but if the volume be found helpful to those for whose use\r\nit has been prepared I shall feel more than gratified.\r\n\r\nThat the subject is of importance is fully realised by farmers and\r\nveterinary surgeons alike, for the annual loss of stock due to poisonous\r\nplants, though not ascertainable, is undoubtedly considerable. It was\r\nfelt that notes on mechanical injury caused by plants and on the\r\ninfluence of plants on milk might usefully be included, as in some\r\ndegree related to poisoning; this has therefore been done. On the other\r\nhand, a number of cultivated plants (_e.g._ _Rhus_, _Wistaria_) which\r\nare poisonous have not been included because exotic and hardly likely to\r\nbe eaten by stock. Fungi generally also find no place in the volume, as\r\nthey are sufficiently extensive to deserve a volume to themselves, and\r\nare far less readily identified than flowering plants.\r\n\r\nThe dividing line between plants which are actually poisonous and those\r\nwhich are only suspected is far from clear, but a division was\r\nconsidered desirable for the convenience of the reader, and an endeavour\r\nhas been made to give a sound but brief statement as to the present\r\ninformation on plants poisonous to live stock in the United Kingdom,\r\nwith symptoms, toxic principles, and a list of the more important\r\nreferences to the bibliography in relation to each plant included in\r\nChapters II to VI (the numbers corresponding with the numbers in the\r\nBibliography).\r\n\r\nRegarding symptoms it is to be regretted that in many cases they appear\r\nto be the result of injections of the toxic extracts, and not\r\nobservations made after natural poisoning by ingestion of the plants.\r\nFurther, there may frequently be doubt as to the identification of the\r\nplant suspected of causing poisoning; indeed, in some cases it is\r\npossible that the identification rests on the veterinary surgeon or the\r\nstockman _thinking_ a certain plant is the cause. The most complete and\r\nsystematic account of European poisonous plants is that of Cornevin\r\n(1887), and references to poisonous plants in the ordinary literature\r\nare heavily indebted to him. In so far as the toxic principles of the\r\nplants are concerned, however, his book is in many instances no longer\r\nreliable.\r\n\r\nThe chemical formulae, quoted for the use of students and research\r\nworkers, have been checked by consulting works by the following authors,\r\nthe reference to the bibliography being given in brackets: Henry (128),\r\nDunstan (76), Allen (4), Haas and Hill (114), Thorpe (240), Van Rijn\r\n(252), Kobert (161), Esser (81), and Beilstein (16).\r\n\r\nApart from the literature consulted I desire to acknowledge my great\r\nindebtedness to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries for kind\r\npermission to make use of official records; to Mr F. W. Garnett,\r\nM.R.C.V.S., for kindly reading the proofs from the veterinary\r\nstandpoint; to very many Experiment Stations, State Departments of\r\nAgriculture, and other authorities in Australasia, America and the\r\nContinent of Europe, for assistance given and literature sent; to Sir\r\nDavid Prain and members of the staff at Kew for much friendly advice,\r\nand aid in consulting the Kew library; to Sir James Dobbie for\r\npermission to spend some time at the Government Laboratories to consult\r\ncertain volumes; to Mr T. H. Middleton, C.B., Dr. E. J. Russell,\r\nProfessor W. Somerville, Sir Stewart Stockman, Professor T. B. Wood, and\r\nothers, for information and many helpful suggestions; to my friend Mr W.\r\nA. Whatmough, B.Sc. (Lond.), for many suggestions and kindly reading the\r\nproofs; and to my colleague Mr W. R. Black for invaluable help in\r\npreparing notes, checking data and reading proofs. To all these, and\r\nmany others who are not mentioned by name, I tender my sincere thanks.\r\n\r\nFor any shortcomings I crave the indulgence of my readers, only\r\nrequesting that they be friendly enough to spare a moment to call my\r\nattention thereto.\r\n\r\n                                                             H.

It\r\nis possible, however, that a plant usually unsuspected may on occasion\r\nprove noxious—for example, _Nepeta Glechoma_ (p. 96), included as\r\nsuspected of poisoning horses. For these reasons, no line of demarcation\r\ncan be drawn to separate actually poisonous plants from those which are\r\nsuspected or are almost certainly quite harmless; and a large number of\r\nspecies is included in Chapter VII as suspected, many of them, however,\r\nbeing almost certainly more or less poisonous in certain circumstances.\r\nIn many cases it is practically impossible to come to any conclusion as\r\nto the degree of toxicity of a plant, owing to the want of exact\r\ninformation. Many plants are quite harmless except when affected by\r\nfungi, moulds, etc.\r\n\r\nA really poisonous plant may be defined as one a small quantity of which\r\nwhen eaten induces some form of indisposition with irritant, narcotic,\r\nor nervous symptoms, with serious or even fatal consequences either\r\nimmediately or by reason of cumulative action of the toxic property.\r\n\r\n=Harm done by Poisonous Plants.= A perusal of the following pages will\r\nafford convincing proof that the question of the general “wholesomeness”\r\nof wild plants is worthy of serious consideration by all who are\r\ninterested in the practice of agriculture. Still more important is a\r\nsatisfactory knowledge of the extent to which plants are actually\r\n_poisonous_—that is, sufficiently injurious when eaten in small or large\r\nquantities to induce more or less severe indisposition, illness or\r\ndeath, with the consequent losses which such bring in their train—loss\r\nof milk and meat production in the case of cattle, of meat and wool\r\nproduction in sheep, of power in the horse, of expenditure in attendance\r\nand veterinary treatment generally, and possibly total loss by death of\r\nthe animals concerned.\r\n\r\nThe losses due to Poisonous Plants in Great Britain happily afford no\r\ncomparison whatever with the immense losses sustained in some other\r\ncountries, such as the cases of lupine poisoning mentioned at p. 29, but\r\ndeaths are sufficiently numerous to make it certain that financial\r\nlosses are in the aggregate very heavy. In this connection it may\r\nsuffice to refer to the many cases of yew poisoning, the losses due to\r\nUmbellifers (pp. 36–42), and the instance reported in the _Staffordshire\r\nWeekly Sentinel_ in relation to meadow saffron and water hemlock (p.\r\n80). Further, it appears to be extremely likely that many losses due to\r\nunascertained causes are really due to plant poisoning. For this reason\r\nveterinary surgeons will be well advised always to consider this\r\npossibility and, if need be, to obtain the services of a trained\r\nbotanist to survey the farm or field involved, with the object of\r\ndeciding whether poisonous plants are present.\r\n\r\n=Circumstances in which Poisoning occurs.= It may be assumed that many\r\nplants are to a considerable extent protected from animals by the fact\r\nthat they have an unpleasant odour, are acrid or bitter to the taste, or\r\nare actually toxic in character, just as others assume such protective\r\ndevices as spines. In a state of nature animals appear to avoid\r\ninstinctively such plants as are toxic or “unwholesome,” and to be less\r\nreadily poisoned than are domesticated animals living under artificial\r\nconditions. Indeed, it has been remarked that farm stock reared in a\r\nlocality where certain poisonous plants abound are much less likely to\r\nbe injured by these plants than animals imported from a district where\r\nthey do not occur.\r\n\r\nThe individuality of stock is also a factor which may be responsible for\r\npoisoning, some animals having what may be described as a depraved\r\nappetite for unusual and unappetising food plants. It would appear that\r\nanimals are often tempted to eat dark-green plants of luxuriant growth\r\nwhich are soft and succulent. This is especially true when the plants\r\nare young and tender, particularly as regards sheep, which, however,\r\nusually avoid tall, old rank-growing and coarse herbage—unless\r\nabsolutely pressed by hunger. Cattle, however, are not so particular,\r\nand will commonly eat large coarse-growing plants.\r\n\r\nSheep have been observed to be particularly variable in their choice of\r\nfood plants, not only individually in the flock, but from day to day.\r\nChesnut and Wilcox remark[1] that “there seems to be no way of\r\naccounting for the appetite or taste of stock. This statement is perhaps\r\nespecially true of sheep. We have often observed sheep eating greedily\r\non one day plants which they could scarcely be persuaded to eat on the\r\nfollowing day on the same range.” In the case of one flock of sheep on a\r\nfoothill range at an altitude of 4,600 ft. “a few of the sheep were\r\nobserved eating large quantities of wild sunflower (_Balsamorhiza\r\nsagittata_), a few ate freely of false lupine (_Thermopsis\r\nrhombifolia_), some confined their attention largely to the wild\r\ngeranium, while others ate false esparcet (_Astragalus bisulcatus_)\r\nalmost exclusively. Two sheep were seen eating the leaves of lupine, and\r\nabout fifty ate a greater or less quantity of _Zygadenus venenosus_,\r\nwhile the majority of sheep in the band fed exclusively upon the native\r\ngrasses on the range.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  “The Stock-Poisoning Plants of Montana,” V. K. Chesnut and E. V.\r\n  Wilcox. _Bul. No. 26. U.S. Dept. Agric., Div. Bot._, 1901.\r\n\r\nHorses also have been known to acquire in America a depraved appetite\r\nfor horsetail and loco-weed.\r\n\r\nThe different species of live stock are often quite differently affected\r\nby poisonous plants, some being very susceptible to a given plant while\r\nothers may be little or not at all susceptible. One species (_e.g._ the\r\npig) may readily vomit the poison of a plant which is emetic, while\r\nanother (_e.g._ the horse) may be unable to do so and hence be the more\r\nseriously injured. The variability of the different classes of live\r\nstock in this respect is frequently brought out in Chapters II to VI.\r\nPoisonous effects may also vary with the individuality and age of\r\nanimals of the same species.\r\n\r\nAt certain periods of the year—_e.g._ in early spring, and during dry\r\nsummers,—there may be a scarcity of green herbage, and this may induce\r\nanimals to eat any green plants which are especially early, including\r\npoisonous ones, which they would otherwise refuse.\r\n\r\nIn some cases poisonous plants which do not lose their toxic properties\r\non drying (_e.g._ meadow saffron) may be included in hay, and hence find\r\ntheir way to stock in such a form that they may not be distinguished. It\r\nhas been found, however, that some poisonous plants or parts of them are\r\nrefused by stock when mixed with good herbage in hay. Care should be\r\nexercised that poisonous plants are not included with hay or green\r\nfodder, and in cases of poisoning all forage should be examined.\r\n\r\nAnimals may also be poisoned by certain toxic seeds (_e.g._ corn cockle)\r\nfed to them with cereal grains, in feeding stuffs generally, or in the\r\nrefuse seeds from the sources mentioned. Here again judgment is\r\nnecessary, and it is probably advisable on all counts to burn the weed\r\nseeds and similar refuse from the sources mentioned. Poisonous seeds may\r\noccur in low quality feeding stuffs, and poisonous seeds of foreign\r\norigin are occasionally sold for food purposes owing to the mistaken\r\nidea that they are a valuable addition to the ration (_e.g._ the\r\npoisonous “Java” beans). In any case in which an animal is believed to\r\nhave been poisoned purchased feeding stuffs should always be considered\r\nas a possible source of injury and be submitted to examination.\r\n\r\nClippings and trimmings from gardens and shrubberies have proved a more\r\nor less common cause of live stock poisoning, such material being too\r\noften carelessly thrown out for animals to pick over. In such\r\ncircumstances it may quite easily happen that the animals get yew,\r\ndaphne, privet, rhododendron, azalea, solanums, and other plants of a\r\npoisonous character. For this reason it is better to destroy such\r\ntrimmings, etc., by burning them, or by adding them to the compost heap\r\nas the case may be.\r\n\r\nA further source of poisoning must be noted here—fleshy and parasitic\r\nfungi (toadstools, rust fungi), moulds and similar organisms. Many\r\ntoadstools are directly poisonous when eaten, but the microscopic\r\norganisms are probably in themselves harmless, though taken with food\r\nwhich they are responsible for injuring (bad hay, cakes, etc.), the\r\npoisoning being due to the changed and damaged feeding stuffs, or\r\npossibly to poisonous principles directly elaborated by the microscopic\r\nfungi. Fungi and related organisms cannot be dealt with in this volume,\r\nbut it may at least be said that the use of mouldy hay and similarly\r\naffected feeding stuffs is attended with some danger, which is not yet\r\nvery clearly defined.\r\n\r\n=Effect of Soil, Climate and Cultivation on the Toxic Properties of\r\nPlants.= In general, wild poisonous plants are richer in either\r\nalkaloids or glucosides than the same species when cultivated, though\r\nthere are exceptions. In many cases it is found that plants vary\r\nconsiderably in toxicity, or the percentage content of the poisonous\r\nprinciple, according to soil, light, moisture, etc. Solanaceous plants\r\nin particular vary in this way, and one or two instances may be given as\r\nexamples. _Solanum nigrum_ varies so much that it has been regarded as\r\nharmless in one country and quite poisonous in another (p. 52).\r\n\r\nExperiments conducted at the Arlington Experimental Farm, Virginia,\r\nshowed that in 24 first-year plants of _Atropa Belladonna_ grown in 1910\r\nthe alkaloid contents of the leaves varied from 0·334 to 0·700 per\r\ncent., and averaged 0·547 per cent. In 1911 the alkaloid contents\r\n(usually the average of five pickings) of the leaves of 59 plants varied\r\nfrom 0·306 to 0·766 per cent., and averaged 0·532 per cent. In 1912 the\r\nalkaloid contents (commonly the average of 5 pickings) of the leaves of\r\n57 plants varied from 0·352 to 0·768 per cent., and averaged 0·545 per\r\ncent. In individual plants at a single picking the highest alkaloid\r\ncontent in 1911 was 0·925 and the lowest 0·200, and in 1912 the highest\r\nwas 0·882 and the lowest 0·292. (_Jour. Agric. Res._, I. 2, Nov., 1913.)\r\n\r\nThe variation in the percentage of poisonous principle was well shown in\r\nseveral papers read at the International Congress of Applied Chemistry\r\nheld at Washington and New York in 1912 (see _Chemist and Druggist_\r\nreports). For example, Carr stated that at the Wellcome Materia Medica\r\nFarm, Dartford, Kent, the effect of manuring on medicinal plants has\r\nbeen tested for some years, and the effect of the more common\r\nfertilisers on _Atropa Belladonna_ was shown by the following table:—\r\n\r\n ────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────\r\n                                     │Percentage of Alkaloid in Dry Stem\r\n                                     │             and Leaf\r\n ──────────────┬───────────┬─────────┼──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────\r\n               │           │         │ 1906 │ 1907 │ 1910 │ 1911 │ 1912\r\n   Fertiliser  │  Time of  │Per acre │ 3rd  │ 4th  │ 1st  │ 2nd  │ 3rd\r\n               │Application│         │year’s│year’s│year’s│year’s│year’s\r\n               │           │         │plants│plants│plants│plants│plants\r\n ──────────────┼───────────┼─────────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────\r\n Main crop     │           │         │ 0·54 │ 0·34 │ 0·61 │ 0·59 │ 0·68\r\n Farmyard      │   March   │50 loads │ 0·54 │ 0·34 │ 0·61 │ 0·53 │ 0·71\r\n manure        │           │         │      │      │      │      │\r\n Nitrate       │  March &  │ 2 cwt.  │ 0·52 │ 0·23 │ 0·54 │ 0·46 │ 0·64\r\n               │   April   │         │      │      │      │      │\r\n Calcium       │    Do.    │ 1 cwt.  │      │      │ 0·69 │ 0·49 │ 0·75\r\n cyanamide     │           │         │      │      │      │      │\r\n Basic slag    │    Do.    │ 2 cwt.  │ 0·61 │      │ 0·65 │ 0·56 │ 0·84\r\n Superphosphate│    Do.    │ 5 cwt.  │ 0·46 │      │ 0·81 │ 0·49 │ 0·76\r\n Potash        │    Do.    │ 5 cwt.  │ 0·61 │ 0·40 │ 0·75 │ 0·53 │ 0·69\r\n ──────────────┴───────────┴─────────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────\r\n\r\nIn considering these results it must be remembered that the soil is\r\nnaturally suited to the plant, and the percentage of alkaloid obtained\r\nwithout added fertilisers is already high. The low figures obtained in\r\n1907 were probably due to the seasonal conditions. Atmospheric\r\nconditions have a modifying influence.\r\n\r\nIt was also shown that the Belladonna root of commerce varies greatly in\r\nalkaloid strength. “In a number of analyses made of commercial roots,\r\nvariations from 0·27 to 0·69 per cent. have occurred. The average of\r\ntwenty-one analyses of German and Austrian commercial roots was 0·40 per\r\ncent. Other observers have recorded similar results. Chevalier (_Compt.\r\nRend._, 1910, 150, 344) gives the following figures for Continental\r\nroots: French, 0·300 to 0·450 per cent.; Austrian, 0·251 to 0·372 per\r\ncent.; Italian, 0·107 to 0·187 per cent. Henderson has shown the average\r\nof thirty samples of foreign root to be 0·3 per cent. It is interesting\r\nto observe that the average of nine samples of root grown at Darenth is\r\n0·54 per cent. In order to determine whether this variation was due to\r\ncollecting at different times of the year, roots from the same plot,\r\nderived from second year’s plants, which were sown at the same time,\r\nwere dug up at intervals and dried. The following is a record of the\r\nanalysis of these samples:—\r\n\r\n                     March, 1911    0·56 per cent.\r\n                     May, 1911      0·59   „   „\r\n                     June, 1911     0·53   „   „\r\n                     August, 1911   0·50   „   „\r\n                     December, 1911 0·59   „   „\r\n\r\n“The amount of variation throughout the year is thus seen to be very\r\nsmall.”\r\n\r\nDunstan (_Bul. Imp. Inst., 1905_) has shown that _Hyoscyamus muticus_\r\ngrown in India yielded 0·3 to 0·4 per cent. of hyoscyamine, but that the\r\nsame species grown in Egypt produced 0·6 to 1·2 per cent.\r\n\r\nAccording to Esser no coniine is found in _Conium maculatum_ growing in\r\nthe far north. The same authority says that the root of _Hyoscyamus\r\nniger_ is quite free from toxic properties in winter.\r\n\r\n=Variation in the Poisonous Parts of Plants.= As will be shown in\r\nsucceeding chapters, many plants (_e.g._ meadow saffron) are poisonous\r\nin all their parts, though the amount of the toxic substance may differ\r\naccording as to whether the seeds, leaves, stem or roots are severally\r\nconsidered. In other cases one part of the plant alone is toxic (_e.g._\r\nthe seeds, as in corn cockle). Further, some species vary in the\r\npercentage of the toxic substance in the leaves before and after\r\nflowering. Frequently the root is the most toxic portion of the plant.\r\nThis point may be usefully recollected in relation to poisoning of live\r\nstock, which are in general affected by the foliage or ripe seeds.\r\n\r\n=Eradication of Poisonous Plants.= Wherever poisonous plants are found,\r\nparticularly in quantity, where they are liable to be eaten by live\r\nstock, an attempt should be made to eradicate them. They may be simply\r\ndealt with as weeds as may be necessary according to the species\r\nconcerned. When any difficulty is experienced in regard either to\r\ndetermination of the species or to methods of eradication the advice of\r\nthe Board of Agriculture and Fisheries (Whitehall Place, London, S.W.)\r\nshould be requested. Stock should at once be removed from a suspected\r\npasture, which should be immediately and thoroughly examined by a\r\ncompetent botanist. Harmful plants should be eradicated and their place\r\nfilled by better herbage.\r\n\r\n=Treatment of Poisoned Animals.= This volume makes no pretensions to\r\ndeal with the veterinary treatment of cases of plant poisoning. Whenever\r\npoisoning is suspected the services of a veterinary surgeon should be\r\nsought without delay; the text books at his disposal will aid him in the\r\ntreatment of any case which presents unusual difficulties. The symptoms\r\nindicated in the following pages, together with the possible discovery\r\nof a suspected plant, may be utilised in diagnosis.\r\n\r\n=Tests with Suspected Plants.= The action of plants on animals may be\r\nascertained (1) by observing the effects in cases in which it has been\r\nestablished that the plants have been eaten, or (2) by direct\r\nexperimental feeding of animals with the plant. In the first case the\r\nresults may be accurate and satisfactory if observations have been made\r\nfrom the outset.\r\n\r\nAs regards (2) the results may or may not be satisfactory according as\r\nthe plan pursued is sound or otherwise. For example, it cannot be\r\nconsidered altogether reasonable and satisfactory to extract the\r\nprinciples present in the plant, inject them into the blood stream, and\r\nconclude from any ill effects that the animal may exhibit that the plant\r\nis poisonous, since the substance extracted may be poisonous under such\r\nconditions but little or not at all harmful when the plant is eaten in\r\nthe small quantities commonly taken by animals. Again, it cannot be held\r\nsatisfactory to feed an animal on a heavy and exclusive diet of the\r\nsuspected plant for a considerable period. The real test would, in\r\ngeneral, consist in a feeding trial in which the suspected plant\r\noccupied a place in the ration in reasonable quantity—such a quantity as\r\nmight well be taken in natural circumstances, in view of its relative\r\nabundance in regard to other food available; and if considered likely\r\nthat the plant would be eaten daily it may be fed regularly for some\r\ndays. Should such a test prove negative it may generally be held that\r\nthe plant is not poisonous, or only so in exceptional circumstances.\r\n\r\n=Legal Aspect of Plant Poisoning.= There is clearly some legal liability\r\nin regard to poisonous plants which may, by hanging over a boundary,\r\ncause injury to a neighbour’s stock. The only cases known to the author\r\nare in relation to the yew. In the case of _Crowhurst v. Amersham Burial\r\nBoard_ (48 L. J., Ex. 109; 4 Ex. D., 5) a Burial Board was held liable\r\nfor the loss of a horse poisoned by eating leaves of a yew tree planted\r\nin the cemetery owned by the Board, the tree having grown through and\r\nover their fence and projected on to the meadow occupied by the\r\nplaintiff. In _Ponting_ v. _Noakes_ (63 L. J. B. 549; (1894) 2 Q.B.,\r\n281) the defendant was not held liable for the death of a horse which\r\nate off the branches of a yew tree, because the tree did not extend up\r\nto or over the plaintiff’s boundary, though it overhung a ditch, the\r\nedge of which was the boundary, and was hence accessible to the\r\nplaintiff’s stock.\r\n\r\n=The Toxic Principles of Plants.= The poisonous substances in plants may\r\nbe grouped either (1) according to their physiological effects on\r\ncertain organs; (2) according to the principal outward and perceptible\r\nsymptoms caused; or (3) in accordance with their chemical relationships.\r\n\r\nIn regard to (1) the poisons may be nerve, heart, blood-poisons, etc.\r\n(2) The poisons may be acrid, narcotic, or both. _Acrid poisons_ are\r\nthose which cause irritation or inflammation of the digestive tract\r\n(_Euphorbia_, _Ranunculus_, _Daphne_, _etc._); _narcotic poisons_ affect\r\nonly or chiefly the brain (_Agrostemma_, _Papaver_, _Atropa_) or chiefly\r\nthe spinal cord (_Claviceps purpurea_, _Lolium temulentum_);\r\n_acrid-narcotic poisons_ induce to a greater or less extent the symptoms\r\nof both the foregoing groups (_Taxus_, _Colchicum_, _Cicuta_, _Solanum_,\r\n_etc._).\r\n\r\n(3) As the accounts of the individual plants will show, the toxic\r\nprinciples of many plants are not yet well understood, either as regards\r\nchemical constitution or symptoms caused. Many poisons may be driven off\r\nby heat (boiling, drying), and some plants may thus be rendered\r\nharmless.\r\n\r\nMost of the toxic principles of our native poisonous plants are\r\nAlkaloids or Glucosides. The former all contain nitrogen, differ\r\nconsiderably in molecular constitution, and are usually combined with\r\nwidely distributed organic acids. In the pure state they are colourless\r\nand usually stable, crystalline or amorphous solids, or readily volatile\r\nliquids; they usually have a burning taste. In general the same base is\r\nconfined to species of the same order—_e.g._ Solanine to the\r\n_Solanaceæ_. The alkaloids include the most powerful poisons.\r\n\r\nThe term “Glucoside” indicates a group of substances which by the action\r\nof an acid or enzyme are split up into a sugar (grape sugar, galactose\r\nor rhamnose) and other substances (alcohol, aldehydes, acids). They have\r\na bitter taste and are generally readily soluble in water. Related to\r\nthe glucosides are also the Saponins, remarkable for the fact that they\r\ninduce an exceedingly frothy condition in water; the prussic acid\r\nyielding compounds or cyanogenetic glucosides (_e.g._ Amygdalin and\r\nPhaseolunatin) also belong to this group. Other substances will be\r\nmentioned in the succeeding chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n                             RANUNCULACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Traveller’s Joy= (_Clematis Vitalba_ L.). The extent to which this\r\nspecies is poisonous is not clear, though all parts are stated to be\r\npoisonous, acrid and narcotic, while the juice tends to blister the\r\nskin. It is remarked by Cornevin that it is less poisonous in spring,\r\nwhen the ass and goat browse on it to a considerable extent without\r\nserious trouble, than later, when it cannot be eaten without danger.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Traveller’s Joy appears to contain strongly poisonous\r\nsubstances which have not been closely investigated. Greshoff found a\r\n_Saponin_ in the leaves[2]. The poison is dissipated by heat.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Kobert states that various species of _Clematis_, _Ranunculus_,\r\n  _Anemone_, and also _Caltha palustris_ and _Trollius europæus_,\r\n  contain _Anemonal_ or _Pulsatilla-camphor_, which causes strong local\r\n  irritation, burning and swelling in the mouth, vomiting, intestinal\r\n  inflammation, etc.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ When eaten in quantity the young shoots are diuretic,\r\nviolently purgative, causing dysentery, and in rare cases death. Applied\r\nto the exterior it is irritating and even vesicatory. (Cornevin.)\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                      63, 81, 101, 130, 161, 233.\r\n\r\n=Anemone= (_Anemone_ sp.). Both our native species of Anemone appear to\r\nbe more or less poisonous in character: the Wood Anemone or Wind Flower\r\n(_A. nemorosa_ L.), and also the Pasque Flower (_A. Pulsatilla_ L.).\r\nThese plants, the former of which grows in woods and damp shady spots in\r\nfields, and the latter on chalk downs and limestone pastures, may on\r\noccasion be taken by stock in early spring, when green herbage is not\r\ntoo plentiful, but deaths appear to be rare, even if they have occurred.\r\nAll parts of the plants contain a toxic principle, which is volatile and\r\ndestroyed by drying.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The toxic substance is stated to be _Anemone-camphor_\r\n(oil of Anemone) which imparts a bitter taste to the plants, and itself\r\ngives rise in the plant to _Anemonic acid_ and _Anemonin_\r\n(C_{10}H_{8}O_{4}), a very poisonous, narcotic substance, stated to be\r\nneither a glucoside, nor an alkaloid, but a ring ketone with the\r\nproperties of an acid anhydride.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The symptoms recorded by Cornevin in the poisoning of\r\nanimals by the fresh plants are nausea, coughing, vomiting (if\r\npossible), stupefaction, muscular tremors, and violent colic,\r\naccompanied at times by hæmaturia and always by diarrhœa and dysentery.\r\nThere are pronounced respiratory and heart troubles.\r\n\r\nPott confirms the symptoms of hæmaturia, diarrhœa, and inflammation of\r\nthe stomach and intestines in the case of _A. Pulsatilla_ when fed in\r\nthe green condition. According to Esser, the plant poison affects the\r\nspinal cord and the brain, the symptoms being similar to those produced\r\nby _Aconitum Napellus_.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n               16, 63, 81, 191, 197, 198, 213, 233, 240.\r\n\r\n=Buttercups= (_Ranunculus_ sp.). A number of species of _Ranunculus_ are\r\nacrid, irritant or severely poisonous, as the case may be. There are\r\nvariations in the poisonous character according to the season, and some\r\nparts of the plant are more toxic than others. At the time the young\r\nshoots develop in the spring but little of the poisonous principle is\r\npresent, and some (_e.g._ _R. Ficaria_) are not then poisonous, but a\r\nlarger quantity of the poisonous principle forms later, and some species\r\nare especially dangerous at the time of flowering, after which the\r\ntoxicity decreases with the maturity and state of dryness of the plant.\r\nThe flowers are the most poisonous, and then the leaves and stem. It\r\ndoes not seem to have been demonstrated that the seeds of any species\r\nare dangerous, though Henslow states that the fruits of some species,\r\nwhen green, appear to be most intensely acrid.\r\n\r\nSome species of _Ranunculus_ are especially harmful (_R. sceleratus_,\r\n_R. Flammula_, and _R. bulbosus_), while others are less so (_R.\r\nlingua_, _R. Ficaria_, _R. acris_). The toxic principle is volatile, and\r\nbuttercups are easily rendered innocuous by drying or boiling—so much so\r\nthat when dried in hay they may be regarded as a nourishing food for\r\nstock, and are readily eaten. Indeed, _R. repens_ is scarcely, if at\r\nall, injurious even when green, though a case of fatal poisoning to\r\nsheep said to be due to this species was reported in the _Veterinarian_\r\nin 1844. Fresh _R. aquatilis_ is held to be quite harmless, and has been\r\nused as a fodder. “Along the banks of the Hampshire Avon, and other\r\nplaces in the same neighbourhood, it is used by the peasantry as fodder.\r\nThey collect it in boats and give it to their cows and horses, allowing\r\nthe former about twenty to thirty pounds a day. One man is said to have\r\nkept five cows and a horse, with little other food but what they could\r\npick up on the heath, using no hay but when the river was frozen. Hogs\r\neat it and will live upon it alone until put up to fatten.” (Johnson and\r\nSowerby—_Useful Plants of Great Britain_.)\r\n\r\n_R. sceleratus_ L., or Celery-leaved Buttercup, is probably the most\r\ntoxic species, and it is stated that in man a single flower may cause\r\npoisonous symptoms resembling those due to _Anemone_ and _Colchicum_. It\r\nis considered especially dangerous to cattle, and has caused many\r\nlosses: among its French names are _Mort aux Vaches_, and _Herbe\r\nsardonique_. Poor people have been known to eat the young shoots when\r\nboiled, heat dispelling the poison.\r\n\r\n_R. Flammula_ L., the Lesser Spearwort, has repeatedly proved fatal to\r\nhorses and cattle.\r\n\r\n_R. bulbosus_ L., the Bulbous Buttercup, is somewhat variable in\r\ntoxicity, and is least dangerous after the flowers have dropped their\r\ncorolla, and the bulb-like rootstock is most harmful in autumn and\r\nwinter. The flowers are the most dangerous part.\r\n\r\n_R. Ficaria_ L., Lesser Celandine, varies in toxicity with locality and\r\nseason, being most harmful at the flowering period. It is stated that\r\nwood-pigeons eat the roots with avidity, and that the young shoots have\r\nbeen eaten as a salad in Germany, as they are not toxic. An English\r\nveterinary surgeon (Flower) recorded that three heifers were poisoned by\r\nit (_Vide_ Cornevin).\r\n\r\n_R. acris_ L., Acrid Buttercup or Tall Crowfoot, is a frequent cause of\r\npoisoning in cattle, and Cornevin says it is perhaps the species which\r\ncauses the most accidents.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The buttercups contain an acrid and bitter juice, the\r\nchemical properties and composition of which are not well known, but it\r\nis believed that the substance is identical with the _Anemonin_ of the\r\n_Anemone_ sp. (_q.v._). Beckurts isolated _Anemonin_ and _Anemonic acid_\r\nfrom _R. acer_. Pott, however, states that the poisonous species contain\r\nthe two alkaloids _Aconitine_ and _Delphinine_.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The buttercups are acrid, burning and narcotic, causing\r\nirritation of the mucous membrane, with inflammation of the intestinal\r\ntract.\r\n\r\nCornevin shows that _R. sceleratus_ induces gastro-enteritis, colic,\r\ndiarrhœa with excretion of black foul-smelling fæces, vomiting when\r\npossible, falling-off in milk yield in cows, nervous symptoms, reduction\r\nin pulse, and stertorous respiration, dilation of the pupils, enfeebled\r\ncondition, difficult mastication, spasmodic movements of the ears, lips,\r\netc.,—followed in serious cases by convulsions, sinking of the eye in\r\nits socket, possibly stoppage, and death in 6 to 12 hours after\r\nconvulsions first appeared.\r\n\r\nIn the _horse_ symptoms substantially similar to the above have been\r\nrecorded (Lander).\r\n\r\nIn _cows_, Pott records hæmaturia, and reddish or bitter milk.\r\n\r\n_Sheep_ after eating _R. repens_ have been noticed to fall suddenly in\r\nthe field; their eyes rolled, and some animals showed dizziness, and\r\ndied with the head inclined over the left flank (Lander).\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n   47, 63, 81, 112, 130, 140, 145, 170, 203, 204, 205, 213, 233, 235.\r\n\r\n=Marsh Marigold= or =King-Cup= (_Caltha palustris_ L.). Like the species\r\nof _Ranunculus_, the Marsh Marigold is to some extent poisonous in\r\ncharacter, and both animals and man have suffered. Cattle have died from\r\neating it, and Müller records the poisoning of many horses, one of which\r\ndied. In general, animals refuse it, but may possibly eat it when\r\npressed with hunger in times of scarcity of green herbage. Cornevin\r\nstates that it has little or no acrid properties when very young, but\r\nthat it is toxic by the time of flowering—acridity increasing with age.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The toxic character of the Marsh Marigold has not\r\nbeen fully investigated, though the presence of an alkaloid has been\r\ndetermined, and A. B. Smith states that the toxic properties are due to\r\nthe alkaloid _Jervine_ (C_{26}H_{37}O_{3}N2H_{2}O) and the glucoside\r\n_Helleborin_ (C_{36}H_{42}O_{6}). On drying—_e.g._ in hay—the plant\r\nbecomes harmless, as in the case of most species of _Ranunculus_.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Cornevin records that _cattle_ have died from inflammation\r\nof the digestive tract, and gives the symptoms as those of _Ranunculus_\r\npoisoning. There seem to be digestive troubles, diarrhœa, and loss of\r\nmilk production, even (according to Rusby) when fed with hay. In the\r\n_horse_, there is colic, bloating, and inflammation of the bladder,\r\nwhile the urine is dark red. According to Cornevin, the symptoms are\r\nsimilar to those produced by _Ranunculus_ sp. Pammel quotes Friedberger\r\nand Fröhner as stating that the plant causes hæmaturia. Five persons who\r\nate it as a herb were “seized with violent sickness and pain in the\r\nabdomen, followed by diarrhœa and general œdematous swelling over the\r\nwhole body,” but they recovered (Johnson and Sowerby).\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                    63, 81, 140, 190, 203, 213, 233.\r\n\r\n=Hellebores= (_Helleborus_ sp.). Two poisonous species of hellebore may\r\non occasion be taken by live stock, though rarely—Stinking Hellebore\r\n(_H. fœtidus_ L.) and Green Hellebore (_H. viridis_ L.). The much\r\nesteemed Christmas Rose (_H. niger_) is also toxic, but unlikely to be\r\neaten by stock. In no case should trimmings of these plants from\r\nshrubberies, etc., be thrown to stock—cows have died from eating such\r\ntrimmings. The two species first mentioned are equally toxic, all parts\r\nare poisonous, and drying does not render them innocuous. Cornevin\r\nrecords that animals have been killed by _H. fœtidus_, and says that 9½\r\noz. of the fresh root or 2½ oz. of the dried root are poisonous doses to\r\nthe horse, while 120 to 150 grains are fatal to sheep. It was recorded\r\nin 1847 (_Veterinarian_) by Mayer that a horse was fatally poisoned\r\nthrough eating five half-pints of the chopped-up leaves of this species\r\nin two days in a bran mash. In regard to this species also Johnson and\r\nSowerby write: “The Bear’s-Foot has been used as a vermifuge ever since\r\nthe days of Hippocrates, notwithstanding its dangerous qualities. Every\r\npart of the plant is a violent cathartic, but far too uncertain in the\r\ndegree of its action to be safely administered.”\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Both species contain the poisonous glucosides\r\n_Helleborin_ (C_{36}H_{42}O_{6}), a highly narcotic and powerful poison;\r\n_Helleborein_ (C_{26}H_{44}O_{15}); and the alkaloid _Jervine_\r\n(C_{26}H_{37}O_{3}N2H_{2}O).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The Hellebores are cathartic, narcotic, and drastically\r\npurgative. Stupor is followed by death with spasms in the case of _H.\r\nviridis_ (Pammel). In general there is in the horse and ox bloody\r\npurgation, salivation, attempts to vomit, and excessive urination,\r\naccording to Lander, who cites Mayer as noting violent straining and the\r\ndischarge of frothy mucus, but no effort to vomit, the heart action\r\nresembling that observed in Digitalis poisoning, showing periodic\r\nintervals of arrest in systole.\r\n\r\nMüller gives the symptoms in cattle and sheep after eating the leaves as\r\nloss of appetite, nausea, and even vomiting, salivation, grinding of\r\nteeth, wind, colic, bloody diarrhœa, decrepitude, giddiness, loss of\r\nsensation, convulsions, and not seldom death.\r\n\r\nAffected cows are stated to give bitter milk which has purgative effects\r\n(Pott).\r\n\r\nThe poisoning of two cows by _H. viridis_ came under the notice of\r\nCornevin. There was observed loss of appetite, diarrhœa, tenesmus,\r\nviolent attempts to evacuate, which after 5 or 6 days resulted only in\r\nthe expulsion of glareous blackish matter; to the end the pulse was slow\r\nand intermittent. The heart beats were weak, and after 5 or 6 beats\r\nthere was a stop equal in duration to at least a beat and a half. A\r\nremarkable fact was the very gradual loss of condition, while the milk\r\nsecretion was maintained until the last day. In one case death occurred\r\nafter 12 days and in the other after 28 days.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n          63, 81, 130, 140, 170, 190, 203, 205, 213, 233, 254.\r\n\r\n=Larkspur= (_Delphinium Ajacis_ Reich.). In the United States of America\r\ncertain species of Larkspur are exceedingly harmful to live stock, and\r\nit has been said that “with the exception of the Loco weeds there is\r\nprobably no poisonous plant on the cattle ranges of the West that has\r\ncaused such heavy losses to stockmen as has larkspur” (_Far. Bul. 53, U.\r\nS. Dept. Agric._). _D. Ajacis_ is the only British species, occurring in\r\ncornfields in Cambridgeshire, Sussex and elsewhere, and, like the\r\nContinental species _D. Consolida_, must be regarded as poisonous and\r\nfatal to cattle, while horses and sheep may also suffer. Sheep and\r\ngoats, however, appear to resist the poison unless taken in considerable\r\nquantity. Wilcox fatally poisoned a yearling lamb within an hour of\r\nadministering per os the extract from less than 1 oz. of the dried\r\nleaves of an American species. The seeds are the most dangerous part of\r\nthe Larkspur, and should never be ground up with wheat should the two\r\nplants grow together. The seeds of _D. Staphisagria_ are used in\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The species _D. Ajacis_ has been little studied, but\r\n_D. Consolida_ and _D. Staphisagria_ contain the alkaloids _Delphinine_\r\n(C_{31}H_{49}O_{7}N), very poisonous and having a bitter taste;\r\n_Delphisine_ (C_{31}H_{49}O_{7}N), which is extremely poisonous;\r\n_Delphinoidine_ (C_{42}H_{68}N_{2}O_{7}), which is poisonous; and\r\n_Staphisagrine_.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The seeds are stated to be emetic and purgative, and _D.\r\nConsolida_ is stated by Pott to be an acute narcotic poison to horses\r\nand cattle. In general the symptoms appear to resemble those produced by\r\n_Aconitum_ (p. 15). There is salivation, vomiting, colic, convulsions,\r\nand general paralysis (Müller).\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n          16, 63, 93, 128, 130, 190, 203, 204, 205, 213, 233.\r\n\r\n=Monkshood= (_Aconitum Napellus_ L.). The extremely poisonous character\r\nof this plant has been recognised since ancient times, and it is\r\nmentioned by Pliny, Dioscorides, etc. It is not common in the wild state\r\nin Britain—chiefly occurring in some Welsh and one or two West of\r\nEngland counties—and is not very liable to cause poisoning of live stock\r\nin Britain. Cases of poisoning of horses, cattle, sheep and pigs have\r\nbeen recorded on the Continent, however (Cornevin), and cows died in\r\nVictoria. Linnæus says that it is fatal to cows and goats when they eat\r\nit fresh, but that when dried it does no harm to horses. Medical works\r\nrecord many cases of human poisoning, particularly in cases where the\r\nroot has been mistaken for horse radish—from which, however, it markedly\r\ndiffers. The leaves at first taste insipid and then sharply burning; the\r\nroot when fresh smells like the radish and has a slightly sweetish\r\ntaste, which is succeeded by characteristic tingling of the tongue and a\r\nsensation of numbness in the mouth.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Monkshood is very poisonous, and though all parts are\r\ntoxic the root is the most dangerous, and next the seeds and leaves. The\r\nplant seems to vary in toxicity with age and climate, being but slightly\r\nactive when very young, most active just before flowering, and at the\r\nminimum of activity when the seeds ripen. The cultivated form is stated\r\nto be much less poisonous than the wild one. Drying removes a part of\r\nthe toxic substance, and boiling removes most of it. The plant contains\r\nthe toxic alkaloid _Aconitine_ (C_{34}H_{45}NO_{11}), and also Aconine\r\n(C_{25}H_{39}NO_{9}). The root contains 0·17 to 0·28 per cent. of\r\n_Aconitine_, but the leaves and flowers less.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The chief symptoms are those of depression, and are\r\nmanifested through the nervous system and the circulatory and\r\nrespiratory organs. Tetanic symptoms are also present. There is loss of\r\nappetite, salivation, inflammation of the mucous membrane of the mouth\r\nand jaws, grinding of teeth, nausea and vomiting, great restlessness and\r\ncolic; the animal groans and walks with an uncertain gait owing to\r\nbodily weakness, giddiness and paralysis of hind feet or of all limbs;\r\nthere is also a notable slackening in the pulse, breathing becomes\r\ndifficult, consciousness is lost and the pupils are dilated. Death\r\nensues in most cases within a few hours, and after convulsions.\r\n\r\nKaufmann (quoted by Cornevin) observed in the _horse_ champing of the\r\njaws, salivation, fibrillous contraction of the muscles of the\r\nolecranon, then of the buttocks, then of the whole body. The intestinal\r\npains were shown by the blows of the animal’s hind feet under and at the\r\nback of the belly. There was also observed an intense and painful\r\ncontraction of the muscles in the inferior cervical region, the hyoid\r\nand the abdomen; an increased sensibility; repeated evacuations; at\r\nfirst congestion, then great paleness of the mucous membranes;\r\ndiminution in the volume of the arteries; faint whinnyings at the moment\r\nof the contraction of the muscles of the neck, shoulders and stomach;\r\nmuscular rigidity of the posterior limbs; uncertain gait; laboured\r\nbreathing; and finally paralysis of motion, respiration and senses.\r\n\r\nLander in giving similar symptoms for the horse notices also choking\r\nmovements of the œsophagus, eructation of frothy matter, dilatation of\r\npupils and low temperature.\r\n\r\nKaufmann gives the poisonous doses of powdered root for the horse and\r\ndog as 13 to 14 oz. and ⅙ oz. respectively.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n    4, 16, 63, 78, 81, 128, 130, 153, 161, 170, 203, 205, 213, 233.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PAPAVERACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Poppies= (_Papaver_ sp.). Poisoning by the two common poppies (_P.\r\nRhoeas_ L. and _P. dubium_ L.) is not common, but Cornevin says that the\r\nformer is poisonous in all its parts, and sufficiently so to cause\r\naccidents every year. Animals may be affected by eating the plant when\r\nmixed with green fodder, or by ingesting the seeds and capsules with\r\nwaste material after the winnowing and grading of cereals. Stock,\r\nhowever, will most likely reject the plants, owing to their unpleasant\r\nodour and taste, but cattle have been poisoned by eating unripe heads of\r\n_P. Rhoeas_ when the plant was mixed with clover and sainfoin. _P.\r\ndubium_ has caused poisoning of horses, cattle and pigs.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Both species contain the alkaloids _Morphine_\r\n(C_{17}H_{19}NO_{3}) and _Rheadine_ (C_{21}H_{21}NO_{6}), which are\r\npresent in the milky juice of the plant. The latter, which was isolated\r\nby Hesse, is believed to have no narcotic effects. The toxic principle\r\nis not destroyed by heating, and the plant is therefore poisonous both\r\nin the green state and when dried in hay.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ It is remarked by Cornevin that cattle poisoned by _P.\r\nRhoeas_ at first exhibit symptoms of excitement, shown by continual\r\nmovement, by pawing of the soil or litter, increased respiration and\r\nmore rapid pulse; this is followed by stoppage of the digestive\r\nfunctions, sometimes a little swelling of the eyelids, and coma, one\r\naffected animal appearing to sleep while standing, remaining motionless,\r\nand if forced to move walking in an unsteady manner. Finally, the animal\r\nfalls, and if a fatal result is likely (which is unusual) it remains\r\nstretched on the ground; respiration becomes slower, the temperature\r\nfalls, and after a few convulsive movements death occurs owing to\r\nasphyxia.\r\n\r\nMüller notes excitement, wildness of look, dilatation of pupil,\r\nconvulsions; then coma, loss of sensation and symptoms of depression\r\nreplace those of excitement. There is salivation, bloating,\r\nconstipation, and in many cases also bloody diarrhoea. Death, however,\r\nis rare.\r\n\r\nPott gives stupidity, retention of urine, colic, with sickness and\r\ndiarrhœa, convulsions, and epileptic symptoms, the animals falling over\r\nand rolling.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                  4, 16, 63, 128, 190, 205, 213, 262.\r\n\r\n=Greater Celandine= (_Chelidonium majus_ L.). This common plant exhales\r\nan unpleasant odour, and when bruised or broken shows the presence of a\r\nyellowish acrid juice, which becomes red immediately on exposure to the\r\nair. It is an old medicinal drug plant, but is dangerous, being emetic\r\nand purgative, with a strongly irritating effect on the digestive tract.\r\nAnimals are but rarely likely to take it, and no record of the death of\r\ndomesticated animals has been found.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Among the substances contained in the Greater\r\nCelandine may be mentioned the bitter alkaloid _Chelidonine_\r\n(C_{20}H_{19}NO_{5} + H_{2}O), which, especially occurring in the root,\r\ndoes not appear to be poisonous, or is of feeble activity; the alkaloid\r\n_Chelerythrine_ (C_{21}H_{17}NO_{4}), which is poisonous; and\r\n_Protopine_ (C_{20}H_{19}NO_{5}). It is stated by Cornevin that the\r\ntoxic substance is not removed on drying, but Pott (1907) remarks that\r\nthe dried plant is harmless to animals, the poisonous alkaloid being\r\nvolatile and disappearing on drying.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The action of this plant is acrid, irritant and narcotic,\r\nemetic and purgative. Esser remarks that when Chelerythrine is\r\nintroduced on the nasal mucous membrane it causes violent sneezing, and\r\ntaken internally causes vomiting. Müller says that poisoning of\r\ndomesticated animals is not recorded, but that according to old accounts\r\n500 grammes (about 1 lb.) of the fresh plant eaten by the horse will at\r\nmost cause slight diabetes.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n               16, 63, 81, 128, 141, 190, 203, 205, 213.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CRUCIFERÆ.\r\n\r\n=Charlock= (_Brassica Sinapistrum_ Boiss.), also known as _B. Sinapis_\r\nVisiani and _Sinapis arvensis_ L., may be regarded as harmless in the\r\nyoung state, but liable to cause injury after flowering, when the seeds\r\nhave formed, when it may occasion serious accidents if eaten by live\r\nstock. A case in which rape cake containing the seeds of charlock caused\r\npoisoning was recorded in 1875 (_Jour. Roy. Agric. Soc._). The seeds\r\nonly are dangerous.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The seeds contain minute quantities of volatile _Oil\r\nof Mustard_ or _Allyl-isothiocyanate_ (C_{3}H_{5}NCS), the alkaloid\r\n_Sinapine_ (C_{16}H_{23}NO_{5}), and the alkaloidal glucoside\r\n_Sinalbin_.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Ingestion of the seeds may cause inflammation of the stomach\r\nand intestines (with loss of appetite, wind, colic, and diarrhœa);\r\ninflammation of kidneys (difficult, excessive or bloody urination); and\r\nnervous symptoms, with great exhaustion, uncertain gait, paralysis of\r\nlimbs and in isolated cases convulsions (Müller).\r\n\r\nPott also records increased salivation.\r\n\r\nIn the _horse_ Cornevin records great depression, difficult and\r\naccelerated respiration, yellowish mucus and convulsive cough. A\r\ncharacteristic symptom is the emission of frothy liquid through the\r\nnostrils (as much as 10 litres in one hour). Death often occurs from\r\nasphyxia in a fit of coughing.\r\n\r\nIn _cattle_, cake containing the seeds caused inflammation of the\r\nintestines, exhausting diarrhœa, and unquenchable thirst.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated Mustards may induce similar effects, and Lander records\r\nthe following symptoms as caused by _Brassica nigra_:—In the _horse_,\r\nbronchial symptoms, marked by difficulty in breathing and the discharge\r\nof great quantities of yellowish frothy matter from the nose; in\r\n_cattle_, uneasiness, restlessness and intense colic, with frantic\r\nrushing about and mania, ending in exhaustion, falling, struggles and\r\ncollapse; in a recent case there were dullness, coldness, some tympany,\r\nlaboured respiration, staggering and falling, and in fatal cases,\r\nimmobility and a semi-comatose condition.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n              4, 16, 63, 76, 127, 170, 190, 205, 213, 219.\r\n\r\n=Wild Radish= (_Raphanus Raphanistrum_ L.). As in the case of charlock,\r\nthe seeds of wild radish are very acrid, and susceptible of introducing\r\nintestinal troubles if eaten by animals when mixed with cereals.\r\n\r\n=Garlic Mustard= (_Alliaria officinalis_ Andrz.) and =Treacle Mustard=\r\n(_Erysimum cheiranthoides_ L.). The seeds are stated to have properties\r\nsimilar to _Brassica Sinapistrum_ (p. 18) owing to a pungent oil; and\r\nwhen eaten in quantity to induce poisoning, inflammation of the\r\ndigestive tract and of the kidneys, as well as nervous symptoms\r\n(Müller).\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CARYOPHYLLACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Soapwort= (_Saponaria officinalis_ L.). This plant is more or less\r\npoisonous, but is rarely, if ever, eaten by stock, and no recorded case\r\nof the poisoning of stock has been met with.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The whole plant, especially the root, contains the\r\npoisonous glucosidal _Saponin_ (C_{18}H_{28}O_{10})_{4}, a peculiar\r\nsubstance which causes intense frothing when stirred in water.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ No symptoms of animal poisoning by the plant are recorded,\r\nbut the action of Saponin in the blood stream is to induce dissolution\r\nof the red cells, with stupefaction and paralysis, as in the killing of\r\nfish by poisoning. It also causes vomiting and purging. Taken by the\r\nmouth it causes inflammation of the alimentary tract, the contents of\r\nwhich are fœtid and mixed with blood.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                       16, 63, 76, 81, 203, 235.\r\n\r\n=Corn Cockle= (_Agrostemma Githago_ L.). This well-known plant of\r\ncornfields must be regarded as poisonous, though experiments and reports\r\nas to its effects on the different classes of live stock vary widely.\r\nThough a poisonous principle is found in nearly all parts of the plant,\r\nthe plant in the green state appears to be innocuous, and is in any case\r\nrarely likely to be eaten fresh by stock, which probably refuse it on\r\naccount of its hairy character. The seeds, however, are by no means\r\nharmless. They are rather large, and somewhat troublesome to separate\r\nfrom cereal grains. When ground up with wheat they both discolour the\r\nflour and impart a grey tint and disagreeable odour to bread made from\r\nit. Further, flour containing a considerable quantity of cockle must,\r\nowing to the poisonous character of the latter, be held to be unfit for\r\nconsumption. Fatal results have followed the use of bread containing\r\nCorn Cockle. The toxic principle therefore is not destroyed by heating,\r\neven in an oven in baking.\r\n\r\nAs regards domestic animals, Corn Cockle seeds have frequently been\r\nmixed with feeding stuffs and have caused many deaths. Cornevin’s\r\nexperiments in feeding calves, pigs and fowls led to fatal results. He\r\nwas able to say that the amounts of cockle flour necessary to cause\r\ndeath were:—\r\n\r\n                 Calf 0·25 lb.│per 100 lb. live weight.\r\n                 Pig  0·10  „ │           „\r\n                 Dog  0·90  „ │           „\r\n                 Fowl 0·25  „ │           „\r\n\r\nAmong other cases, Kornauth and Arche found that in their feeding trials\r\npigs were not killed, but albuminoid metabolism was diminished and fat\r\nproduction increased. In 1893 pigs died in Germany with symptoms of\r\nacute poisoning, when fed on tailings containing six per cent. of\r\ncockle. In 1903–4 experiments showed that with the cow, sheep, pig and\r\ngoat, cockle is not poisonous when fed in amounts usually found in\r\nfeeding stuffs. Millspaugh gives a case in which two calves died on\r\nbeing fed with two lots of 14½ oz. each of wheat flour containing 30 per\r\ncent. and 45 per cent. of cockle seeds. About 1892 Nevinny concluded\r\nthat six grammes of cockle seed consumed in 1200 grammes of bread were\r\nbeyond doubt poisonous in effect, and that the sale of grain or flour\r\ncontaining it should be forbidden. Kobert held that the sale of feeding\r\nstuffs containing cockle should be forbidden by law. An extensive study\r\nof this question was made by Pesch, who concluded that “Under certain\r\nconditions Corn Cockle is injurious to domestic animals. The amount of\r\nthe poisonous substance in the seed is variable, depending probably upon\r\nthe season and the soil. Animals become accustomed to it, so that\r\namounts of seed which at first cause sickness, later have no injurious\r\neffect. The susceptibility of animals to the poison varies both with the\r\nspecies and the individual. Young animals are more readily affected than\r\nolder ones. It is believed that rodents and sheep are not susceptible,\r\nand, as far as is known, grown cattle are only slightly or not at all\r\naffected by the poison. Calves, swine, horses, and especially dogs, are\r\nmore or less susceptible. Concerning birds and fowls there is some\r\ndoubt.”\r\n\r\nThough animals are reputed to become tolerant of the poison if the\r\ncockle is only taken in small regular doses, yet there appears to be a\r\nchronic form of poisoning due to this cause and termed _Githagism_,\r\nwhile there is an acute poisoning due to the ingestion of large\r\nquantities of the seeds which may cause death in 24 hours or less.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the evidence is quite sufficient to warrant the\r\nstatement that the ingestion of more than a very small quantity of\r\ncockle seed is dangerous, and the consumption of even small quantities\r\nshould be avoided. Thus care should be taken to remove the seeds from\r\ncereal grains.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The dangerous substance contained in cockle seeds\r\nis the glucoside variously known as _Githagin_, _Saponin_,\r\n_Agrostemmin_, _Sapotoxin_, _Agrostemma-Sapotoxin_, or _Smilacin_\r\n(C_{17}H_{26}O_{10})_{2}. This principle appears to occur chiefly in\r\nthe seeds, which contain up to 6·56 per cent., but it has been found\r\nin small quantities in other parts of the plant. It is very freely\r\nsoluble in water, in which it froths like soap when shaken up, and it\r\nhas a sharp taste and no odour.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ A sufficient quantity of the toxic substance may cause\r\nnervous debility and dysentery—according to Chesnut “intense irritation\r\nof the digestive tract, vomiting, headache, nausea, vertigo, diarrhœa,\r\nhot skin, sharp pains in the spine, difficult locomotion, and depressed\r\nbreathing. Coma is sometimes present and may be followed by death. In\r\nanimals chronic diarrhœa and gradual depression.”\r\n\r\nThe chronic form, which occurs when small doses are repeated over a long\r\nperiod (practically the only form found in human beings, but never in\r\nanimals, except perhaps in the pig) is characterized by gradual wasting\r\naway, loss of breath, loss of strength, chronic diarrhœa, and nerve\r\ntroubles, death taking place in marasmus and decline. The active\r\nprinciple acts as an irritant on the digestive tract, causing colic,\r\ndiarrhœa and enterorrhagia.\r\n\r\nCornevin describes the symptoms in the acute form of the poisoning in\r\nthe case of horses, cattle, pigs and dogs.\r\n\r\nIn the _horse_, if a small quantity only is taken, there is yawning,\r\nheavy colic, stamping and evacuation of rather soft fæces. If larger\r\nquantities are taken, the symptoms, which commence in about an hour, are\r\nsalivation, frequent yawning and turning of the head, colic, pale mucus,\r\nhurried and weak pulse, rise in temperature and accelerated respiration.\r\nSome time later there are muscular tremors succeeded by pronounced\r\nrigidity, and the fæces are diarrhœic and fœtid. The animal lies down,\r\nand getting up is painful; it falls into a kind of coma, stretches\r\nitself to the utmost, and death takes place without convulsions.\r\n\r\nIn _cattle_, the symptoms observed one hour after eating are\r\nrestlessness, salivation, and grinding of the teeth. Excitement and\r\ncolic are followed sometimes by coughing, this state lasting from five\r\nto eight hours. There is then a period of coma, characterized by\r\npermanent decubitus, repeated fœtid diarrhœa, hurried and plaintive\r\nrespiration, accelerated and gradually weakening pulse, a gradual loss\r\nof motor and sensory powers, and a progressive decline in temperature.\r\nDeath occurs in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nIn the case of _pigs_, the animal grunts, lies down and remains thus\r\nwith its snout embedded in the straw. There is vomiting, more or less\r\nviolent colic and diarrhœa, the evacuation consisting of bad-smelling,\r\nspumous fæcal matter. At times there are clonic contractions. Young pigs\r\nare most susceptible.\r\n\r\nPott cites cases in which abortion was a feature of the poisoning, both\r\nin cows and pigs. The results of numerous experiments which he quotes\r\n(among others some carried out for the Prussian Ministry of Agriculture)\r\nare very contradictory, a small quantity causing death in some animals,\r\nwhile others of the same species were left unharmed by large quantities.\r\nHe ascribes this to the very variable proportions of the poison present\r\nin the seeds.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n  4, 16, 28, 46, 52, 53, 63, 76, 81, 82, 144, 161, 172, 184, 190, 203,\r\n                             205, 213, 249.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              HYPERICINEÆ.\r\n\r\n=St. John’s Wort= (_Hypericum perforatum_ L.). There appears to be no\r\nrecord of poisoning of live stock by this plant in Britain, but Cornevin\r\nrecords that it injured breeding mares fed on lucerne containing it in\r\nlarge proportion. Drying in converting into hay did not render it\r\ninnocuous. It is only poisonous if eaten in considerable quantity, and\r\nin general animals are not likely to eat much of it voluntarily, owing\r\nto its resinous odour when crushed, and a bitter and slightly saline\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The poisonous properties of St. John’s Wort have not\r\nbeen fully investigated, but it is stated to contain an oil and an acrid\r\nbitter resin. Ewart says that it “contains an oil whose medicinal value\r\nwas formerly highly esteemed; but this oil, and the woody nature of the\r\nplant, render it somewhat injurious in fodder.” Summers says (_Journ.\r\nAgric. S. Australia_, Sept. 1911, p. 144) that “it is reported to be\r\ndecidedly injurious, causing horses who eat it to break out in sores,\r\nwhile milk cows have a tendency to dry off owing to its effect on the\r\nsystem.”\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ In mares, dullness, sinking of head, loss of appetite,\r\nslackening of pulse and respiration, dilatation of pupils, defective\r\nsight, and lips purple (Müller).\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                         63, 82, 117, 190, 203.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              GERANIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Wood Sorrel= (_Oxalis Acetosella_ L.). Though rarely likely to be eaten\r\nby stock this plant must be mentioned here, as it is considered\r\ndangerous on account of its high content of oxalates, which may cause\r\nserious illness and diarrhœa, and in the case of sheep even be fatal.\r\nPott says that the milk of cows eating it is with difficulty converted\r\ninto butter.\r\n\r\n                               REFERENCE.\r\n\r\n                                  213.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n                              CELASTRACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spindle Tree= (_Euonymus europæus_ L.). According to Cornevin the\r\nspindle tree is poisonous in all its parts, especially the fruits, which\r\nare emetic and strongly purgative. Sheep and goats have been injured\r\nfrom eating the leaves, and children have suffered from eating the\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ This plant does not appear to have been closely\r\nstudied from the toxicological point of view; contrary to the statements\r\ngenerally made in the literature Van Rijn remarks that this species does\r\nnot contain the doubtfully classed _Euonymin_.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Ingestion of the plant induces symptoms and lesions such as\r\nare due to violent vegetable purgatives.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                           63, 81, 205, 252.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               RHAMNACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Buckthorn= (_Rhamnus Catharticus_ L.) and (_R. Frangula_ L.). The\r\nberries of both species are toxic and purgative, but both are uncommon\r\nand rarely eaten by stock.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The berries and bark contain the glucosides\r\n_Frangulin_ (C_{21}H_{20}O_{9}) and _Rhamnetin_ (C_{16}H_{12}O_{7}).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The berries are purgative, and there is some danger from\r\nlarge quantities, which may induce superpurgation. The leaves are\r\nastringent and may arrest milk secretion (Cornevin). Müller states that\r\nthe inflammation of the stomach and intestines may terminate fatally.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                          4, 63, 76, 190, 203.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PAPILIONACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Laburnum= (_Cytisus Laburnum_ L.). The well-known and much admired\r\nLaburnum must be regarded as one of the most poisonous species of\r\nBritish plants. By numerous experimental researches Cornevin proved that\r\nall parts of the plant are poisonous—root, wood, bark, leaves, flowers,\r\nand seeds, especially the seeds. In his experiments the horse, ass,\r\nsheep, goat, dog, cat, fowl, duck and pigeon, were utilized, seeds being\r\ngiven. He found that 80 centigrammes per kilogramme live weight would be\r\nnecessary to kill a horse (say 1 lb. for an animal of 1200 lb. live\r\nweight), 60 centigrammes per kilogramme live weight to kill an ass (say\r\n6 oz. for an ass weighing 600 lb.); and 6 grammes in the case of a fowl\r\n(say 0·4 oz. for a fowl weighing 4½ lb.). The sheep and goat he was not\r\nable to kill, as they refused the food after a certain point; the dog\r\nand cat he was not able to kill because they so readily vomited; and the\r\nduck and pigeon vomited with extreme facility.\r\n\r\nMany cases of the poisoning of children have occurred through the\r\ningestion of the flowers and seeds. In 1908 a case was recorded by the\r\nBoard of Agriculture and Fisheries, in which two horses were alleged to\r\nhave been poisoned in North Wales by laburnum seeds, a very small\r\nquantity of which was found in their stomachs after death.\r\n\r\nMüller states that in Dalmatia goats which had eaten _Cytisus Weldeni_,\r\nthough themselves uninjured, produced milk which was poisonous to man.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ All parts contain the toxic alkaloid _Cytisine_\r\n(C_{11}H_{14}N_{2}O), said by Moer and Partheil to be identical with\r\nUlexine; it is found in the seeds to the extent of 1·5 per cent.\r\nCornevin states that the root, wood and bark are nearly constant in\r\ntoxicity, but that the leaves and pods present remarkable seasonal\r\nvariations owing to the migration of the poison into the seeds. The\r\ntoxic property is not destroyed by drying of the plant.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Laburnum poisoning is of the acrid, narcotic type, with, in\r\nman, nervous symptoms, abdominal pain, vomiting, purging, tetanic spasms\r\nand convulsions.\r\n\r\nCornevin’s observations show that the symptoms occur in three\r\nconsecutive stages,—(1) excitement, (2) coma and incoordination of\r\nmovement, and (3) convulsions. The order of the appearance, their\r\nduration, and the association of each with the others depend upon the\r\nsusceptibility of the animal and the quantity ingested. Thus the\r\nsymptoms of excitement may be present alone if only a small quantity is\r\neaten; the duration of the symptoms in this case is never considerable,\r\nand the normal is gradually regained. In general, however, the symptoms\r\nare associated in pairs; thus when an average quantity is fed there is\r\nexcitement and coma but _no_ convulsions; when large quantities are fed\r\nthe first stage is suppressed or is so short as to be almost\r\nimperceptible, the coma and convulsions being present simultaneously. As\r\nregards temperature, there is, in stage (1) a rise, in stage (2) a drop,\r\nand in stage (3) a rise again near death. In stages (2) and (3) there is\r\na slackening of respiration, the arterial tension is raised, there is an\r\nincrease in the number of pulsations and a modification of the rhythm.\r\nIn stage (3) near death there is a lowering of the arterial tension, and\r\nthe pulsations become gradually less perceptible, but with a uniform\r\nrhythm; there is a slackening in respiration, and by the time this\r\nfinally ceases the heart beats have become imperceptible.\r\n\r\nWhen _horses_, _asses_ or _mules_ have eaten a small quantity of the\r\nseeds or leaves, there is simply yawning and uncertain gait, these\r\nsymptoms lasting for two hours, and the normal being regained after\r\nurination. Considerable (but not fatal) quantities cause unsuccessful\r\nattempts at vomiting, sometimes opisthotonos in asses, sweating,\r\nmuscular tremors, and then a deep coma which may last 15 hours. Fatal\r\nquantities cause yawning, sexual excitement, accelerated and noisy\r\nrespiration, wheezing, muscular tremors followed by contractions which\r\ncommence in the posterior limbs and spread to the anterior limbs, facial\r\ncontractions, staggering and copious sweating. A rapid fall in\r\ntemperature follows, but there is a slight rise during the period of\r\nconvulsions; the pulse is at first quicker and stronger, but the number\r\nof beats rapidly comes back to the normal, to rise again shortly before\r\ndeath; the rhythm of the pulse is at first regular (in groups of 2, 3 or\r\n4) but becomes irregular again just before death. The animal at length\r\nfalls, and cannot get up, the nostrils are distended, the mouth is wide\r\nopen, respiration becomes gradually slower, and death takes place in\r\ngreat agony.\r\n\r\nIn cases of poisoning of horses and asses noticed by Pott animals that\r\ncould not vomit died very quickly. The symptoms were excitement, nausea,\r\ncoma, slower breathing, convulsions, paralysis of the motor nerves, and\r\nfinally cessation of the action of lungs and heart.\r\n\r\n_Ruminants_ are much less susceptible than horses. Cornevin’s attempts\r\nat poisoning failed through their refusal of the plant. Müller observed\r\nin a case of cattle poisoning, bloating, paralysis of the limbs\r\n(especially fore limbs), sleepiness, dilatation of pupils, and later\r\nsalivation, nausea, coma and occasional convulsive movements of the\r\nmuscles of the extremities. These symptoms persisted through several\r\ndays and then disappeared.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n            4, 16, 63, 64, 81, 128, 144, 161, 190, 205, 213.\r\n\r\n=Broom= (_Cytisus Scoparius_ Link.). This very plentiful and widely\r\ndistributed plant is undoubtedly to some extent poisonous, though\r\nperhaps only feebly so in the quantities likely to be eaten by domestic\r\nanimals. Blyth records 400 cases of poisoning from it, however. Very\r\nhungry animals might eat too much of it, and hence show symptoms of\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The plant contains the alkaloid _Cytisine_\r\n(C_{11}H_{14}N_{2}O); also the volatile alkaloid _Sparteine_\r\n(C_{15}H_{26}N_{2}), a single drop of which, according to Blyth, killed\r\na rabbit, which showed symptoms similar to those of nicotine poisoning.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Taken in sufficient quantity broom induces narcotic\r\npoisoning, with symptoms resembling those caused by Coniine, with\r\ncentral nervous paralysis.\r\n\r\nCornevin gives the symptoms as similar to those due to _C. Laburnum_.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                          4, 16, 82, 128, 203.\r\n\r\n=Indian Peas= (_Lathyrus sativus_ L.). A type of poisoning that deserves\r\nattention here is that known as _Lathyrism_, since it is due to the\r\nconsumption of peas of the genus _Lathyrus_, the most dangerous being\r\nthe “Indian Pea,” _L. sativus_. The peas of this plant (see\r\nFrontispiece) are small and dark-coloured, and are imported largely from\r\nIndia and other countries under the general name of Mutter peas, a name\r\nwhich they share with the ordinary pea _Pisum sativum_. In addition to\r\nthe seeds of this species the seeds of two South European and North\r\nAfrican species—_L. Cicera_ and _L. Clymenum_—have commonly caused\r\npoisoning both in man and in animals, not infrequently leading to fatal\r\nresults. Horses, cattle, sheep and pigs have been affected—horses\r\nparticularly so—and many cases have been recorded in the veterinary\r\njournals since 1885. Very heavy losses have occasionally resulted from\r\nthe use of the raw peas as a food for stock. For example, in 1884\r\nMessrs. Leather of Liverpool had 35 out of 74 cart horses ill through\r\neating Indian peas at the rate of 3 to 4 lb. per head per day. Of the 35\r\nno less than 19 died, and 2 were slaughtered, while 14 recovered. In the\r\nfamous Bristol Tramways case (1894) 123 out of 800 horses became ill\r\nowing to being fed on the peas of _L. sativus_, and many died. There are\r\nfew records of harm to cattle, sheep and pigs, and Watt quotes Don to\r\nthe effect that pigeons lose their power of flight by feeding on the\r\npeas. Very large quantities of the peas are used for feeding purposes,\r\nand the fact that the losses are not larger is probably because the peas\r\nonly comprise a small proportion of the ration or are cooked before use.\r\n\r\nAfter boiling or roasting the peas appear to be less harmful, as they\r\nare eaten in India when cooked, or ground into flour and converted into\r\nbread—though Cornevin states that drying and cooking does not destroy\r\nthe toxicity, while boiling for some time showed that at any rate part\r\nof the toxic substance passed into the water, which became toxic and\r\ncaused death, the boiled seeds losing the greater part of their\r\npoisonous property and not causing accidents when the water was\r\nrejected. MacDougall states that as far as experimental evidence was\r\navailable (1894) it seemed to show that boiling the seeds before use\r\nrenders them innocuous.\r\n\r\nLathyrism usually only supervenes when the use of the peas for food is\r\nprolonged, and the peas are taken in considerable quantity, but it is\r\npossible that there is wide variation in the toxicity of different\r\nsamples, owing to differences in soil, climate, and other factors. In\r\nman, Lathyrism is stated to be common in Spain, Italy, Russia and India,\r\nowing to continued use of bread from flour of the three species of\r\n_Lathyrus_ mentioned above. It is said especially to affect males.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Nothing certain as to the poisonous properties is\r\nknown, attempts to isolate the toxic substance having failed (Kobert),\r\nthough Smith gives it as prussic acid, apparently indicating a\r\ncyanogenetic glucoside. This, however, can hardly be so, as the poison\r\nis cumulative, and may not show its effects for weeks or months, or, in\r\nman, even years—according to the quantity of peas eaten.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Lathyrism is only produced when the ration consists largely\r\nof the pea for a considerable period (see above); in the horse fed\r\nexclusively on the pea, the tenth day; but when one or two quarts are\r\ngiven daily, only towards about the 80th day. Moreover, the malady may\r\ndeclare itself as long as fifty days after the cessation of the pea\r\nfeeding (Lander).\r\n\r\nIn general Lathyrism is marked by paralysis of the lower extremities in\r\nman and the hind limbs in animals, owing to the degeneration of the\r\nmuscle fibres, and possibly to affection of the nerves. In _horses_\r\nthere is paralysis of the hind limbs, dyspnœa and roaring—with paralysis\r\nof the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and transverse myelitis. The horse\r\nthus shows weakness of the hind quarters, staggering in the effort to\r\nstand, difficulty in breathing, abnormally fast and irregular pulse,\r\nopen mouth, distended nostrils. Tracheotomy often gives almost immediate\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nLander mentions in cart horses grinding of teeth, and convulsive\r\nmovements of the eyes, recalling epilepsy. In one outbreak there was\r\nthick wind, staggering gait, weakness of hind quarters, and general\r\nsigns of intoxication; and sudden violent attacks of laryngeal paralysis\r\nand dyspnœa during which there was palpitation, frothing, tongue\r\nprotruded, eyes staring, bluish tint of buccal membranes, and\r\npalpitation. Paroxysms sometimes proved fatal.\r\n\r\nAn attack among 125 _lambs_ is mentioned by Cornevin. The lambs could\r\nnot stand on their fore legs and were obliged to go down on their knees.\r\nOn setting them up again, they were only able to keep up while\r\nmotionless or moving slowly. There was loss of sensibility in the front\r\nmembers. In spite of this the eye was alert, they were attentive to\r\neverything that went on around them, and were easily frightened.\r\n\r\nIn _pigs_ paralysis of posterior members has been observed.\r\n\r\nIn _cattle_ there was staggering, blindness, and stiffness of the lower\r\njoints. In _sheep_ and _pigs_ there was also paralysis of the hind\r\nlimbs.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                 63, 82, 137, 170, 179, 190, 203, 205.\r\n\r\n=Yellow Vetchling= (_Lathyrus Aphaca_ L.). To what extent this vetchling\r\nis poisonous to stock is not clearly known, but it is cultivated in\r\nIndia as a fodder for cattle. The seeds, however, are not altogether\r\nsafe when ripe, and MacDougall says “The seeds and pods have been known\r\nto be used in soup in their young state and without harm resulting, but\r\nthe ripe seeds are narcotic and cause sickness and headache.”\r\n\r\n=Lupines= (_Lupinus_ sp.). Different species of _Lupinus_ have been\r\nfound to cause poisoning of live stock, more particularly sheep, which,\r\nwhen fed largely on lupines, develop a chronic type of poisoning known\r\nas _Lupinosis_, or poisoning may be acute and rapid in its effects, as\r\nin the United States. Records of large numbers of sheep being affected\r\nat a time date from 1872, in various parts of the German empire. In\r\nEurope by far the most harmful species is the Yellow Lupine (_L.\r\nluteus_), which has been the cause of heavy losses of sheep, though\r\nhorses, cattle and goats may also be affected. The Blue Lupine (_L.\r\nangustifolius_) and White Lupine (_L. albus_) may also be toxic. _L.\r\nluteus_ has caused lupinosis in Germany since 1860, and Cornevin states\r\nthat in 1880 no less than 14,138 out of 240,000 sheep fed upon it (or\r\n5·89 per cent.) died. Of 44 horses affected 11 died.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that all crops of lupine are poisonous, as\r\nlupines are extensively grown on the Continent for fodder purposes and\r\nare usually harmless. Even where Lupinosis occurs, considerable\r\nquantities of the lupine must be ingested to cause poisoning. The\r\ntoxicity appears to vary according to soil and certain indefinite\r\nconditions, and sometimes even a kilogramme (2·2 lb.) of the plant would\r\nsuffice to kill a sheep. Poisonous symptoms may sometimes be observed\r\nafter a single meal. Desiccation does not render the plant innocuous,\r\nthe seeds and hay being poisonous.\r\n\r\nIn the United States species of _Lupinus_ have caused great loss. In\r\n1898 no fewer than 1,150 of a flock of 2,500 sheep died from eating one\r\nspecies; one sheep farmer lost 700 sheep from the same cause; and 1,900\r\nout of 3,000 sheep died from Lupine poisoning in Montana in 1900. Lupine\r\nhay is found to be less harmful to horses and cattle, and Chesnut and\r\nWilcox suggest that this is possibly because as a rule they avoid the\r\npods, while sheep eat them. Lupines in America are very rapid in their\r\naction on sheep, which may often die in one-half to three-quarters of an\r\nhour after eating a quantity of the pods. Further, there is evidence\r\nthat sheep may gradually become immune to the poison by eating Lupines\r\nregularly, since sheep fed regularly on hay nearly half lupine were\r\nunaffected, but others eating the same hay for the first time died in\r\nconsiderable numbers. The lupines are certainly far the most dangerous\r\nwhen they bear ripe seeds—cut and made into hay before the pods form\r\nthey are much less dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn regard to _L. luteus_ Lander says: “According to the German\r\nauthorities a daily ration of 1 pound of the whole plant, ⅗ pound of\r\nempty pods, or 1⅕ pound of seeds, will produce poisoning.”\r\n\r\nVarious means have been tried to render Lupines harmless, and success is\r\nstated to follow heating with steam under a pressure of 2 to 2½\r\natmospheres.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ A very full account of Lupine poisoning is given by\r\nPott, and from this a brief summary may be made. Siewert and Wildt\r\n(1879) found two substances very like the alkaloids of _Conium\r\nmaculatum_—one like Coniine and the other like Conhydrine, the former\r\nonly being proved to be very poisonous. Baumert states that in _L.\r\nluteus_ there are only two bitter alkaloids, _Lupinine_ (C_{10}H_{19}ON)\r\nand _Lupinidine_ = _Sparteine_ (C_{15}H_{26}N_{2}). Many investigators\r\n(_e.g._ Kühn at Halle) held that lupinosis was not identified with the\r\npresence of lupine alkaloids. Then, in 1883, Arnold and Schneidemühl\r\ncaused the disease (lupinosis) in sheep with lupines freed from all\r\nalkaloids, and they isolated from the seeds a substance they named\r\n_Lupinotoxin_, which they found to be poisonous. The nature of the\r\npoison cannot yet be said to be fully understood. The Lupine does not\r\nalways appear to be poisonous—only under certain conditions which are\r\nnot too well defined. One farmer had Lupines on the same soil for twelve\r\nyears without ill effects when fed to sheep, and then of 450 sheep 120\r\nwere severely ill, and 80 died; they had had unthrashed Lupine, not\r\nquite ripe, to the extent of one-fourth of the ration. It is held to be\r\ndefinitely established that the presence of this poison is due in turn\r\nto the presence of a saprophytic fungus; when the fungus is absent or\r\nonly present in small quantity the lupine is not at all or only slightly\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The disease is either acute or chronic according to the\r\namount of poison ingested. Most writers describe the disease in sheep,\r\nbut symptoms given vary somewhat.\r\n\r\nIn the acute form sheep become ill suddenly. There is loss of appetite,\r\ndyspnœa, intense fever, hæmaturia, circulatory and digestive troubles,\r\ngrinding of teeth and trembling, which may pass into spasmodic\r\ncontractions. Vertigo is sometimes present. Jaundice then appears and is\r\nevidenced by the yellow colour of the mucous membranes. Tumefaction of\r\nthe eyelids, lips and ears is common, but not invariably present.\r\nMicturition is frequent, but not abundant, and the urine contains\r\nalbumen; the excrements are few and dry. There is collapse, and loss of\r\ncondition progresses rapidly, death occurring on the fourth to the sixth\r\nday after the commencement of the illness.\r\n\r\nIn the chronic form the interstitial hepatitis predominates. Tumefaction\r\nof the head may also appear as in the acute form. Digestive troubles\r\nindicate chronic gastro-enteritis. This condition lasts for from 15 to\r\n20 days, during which the cephalic œdemæ are eliminated by gangrene and\r\nthe animals remain listless and without appetite. The illness in sheep\r\nis grave, and affected animals are rarely completely cured. The\r\nmortality in other species does not seem to be less than in sheep.\r\n(Cornevin.)\r\n\r\nIn describing the acute form of lupinosis Pammel adds that the initial\r\ntemperature may be as high as 104° to 106° F., but that it is\r\nintermittent and gradually falls just before death. The pulse may reach\r\n130 per minute and the respirations 100. A bloody froth may issue from\r\nthe nostrils. Animals apparently prefer the recumbent position, extend\r\nthe head on the ground, and seem entirely oblivious to all surroundings.\r\nAt first there is constipation, but later diarrhœa may set in and the\r\nexcreta be tinged with blood. In the chronic form the symptoms are not\r\nso violent. Jaundice may be entirely absent, and emaciation and anæmia\r\nmay be the chief signs.\r\n\r\nChesnut and Wilcox record a case in which two sheep were each given 150\r\nmedium-sized pods of a native lupine, and seemed to like them. In 45\r\nminutes, however, they became frenzied and died an hour later. They give\r\nthe symptoms as practically the same as those caused by European species\r\nof _Lupinus_; acute cerebral congestion, with great mental excitement,\r\nthe sheep rushing about and butting into things; following is a stage\r\ncharacterized by irregularity of movement, violent spasms, and falling\r\nfits; in most cases collapse and death occur within half-an-hour to an\r\nhour and a half; the pulse is strong and regular; the convulsions\r\nresemble to some extent those caused by strychnine; the excretion of the\r\nkidneys is much increased and sometimes bloody. In post-mortem\r\nexamination the kidneys are found affected, the lungs slightly\r\ncongested, the cerebral membranes in all cases congested, and in violent\r\ncases small blood vessels are ruptured in different parts of the body.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n  4, 16, 20, 21, 42, 57, 63, 69, 82, 93, 128, 161, 166, 170, 190, 203,\r\n                                  213.\r\n\r\n=“Java” Beans= (_Phaseolus lunatus_). Though not native to Great\r\nBritain, the so-called Java Beans have been imported in considerable\r\nquantities for stock feeding, and in the past nine years have caused the\r\ndeath of a large number of animals. For example, in March, 1906, the\r\nBoard of Agriculture and Fisheries published an account of the poisoning\r\nof animals by these beans at eight centres; at six of the centres 133\r\ncattle were involved and 43 died. The beans are of varying origin, and\r\npass under the name of Java beans, Rangoon beans, Burma beans, Lima\r\nbeans, and Paigya beans. They are considerably different in colour\r\naccording to origin, the _Java_ beans being pale brown to almost black;\r\n_Rangoon_, _Burma_ or _Paigya_ beans smaller, plumper, and lighter in\r\ncolour (“red Rangoon beans” are pinkish with small purple splotches, and\r\n“white Rangoon beans” are pale cream); and _Lima_ beans are much larger\r\nthan the last-named and pale cream or white in colour (see\r\nFrontispiece).\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that beans of certain forms of _Phaseolus\r\nlunatus_ are poisonous, and the fact is noted by Church (_Food Grains of\r\nIndia_, 1886), and by Watt (_Dictionary of the Economic Products of\r\nIndia_, 1889–96). The coloured forms, and particularly the wild forms,\r\nare the most dangerous, the white types being in general safe for stock\r\nfeeding. Some forms have a general similarity to butter beans and\r\nharicots, and have hence been favourably regarded by farmers, but it is\r\na sound plan to purchase under a guarantee beans with such names as\r\nthose given.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ It was shown in 1903 (_Proc. Roy. Soc._, Vol. 72)\r\nthat the seeds of _P. lunatus_, uncultivated in Mauritius, contained a\r\ncyanogenetic glucoside, _Phaseolunatin_ (C_{10}H_{17}O_{6}N). This\r\nglucoside, under favourable conditions, such as are present when the\r\nbeans are moist, masticated and ingested at the temperature of the\r\nanimal body, gives rise to prussic acid, which is the direct cause of\r\npoisoning. The seeds of the wild forms yield, like bitter almond seeds,\r\nconsiderable quantities of prussic acid, while the cultivated forms\r\nresemble sweet almonds in yielding only traces of the acid, or none at\r\nall. Determinations of the yield of prussic acid by various\r\ninvestigators show percentages of from 0·027 to 0·137 in _Java_ beans,\r\nand 0·004 to 0·02 in _Burma_ beans. The largest proportion therefore\r\noccurs in the coloured beans, while the white forms contain much less or\r\nnone at all, and may be generally regarded as safe for stock.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._—The symptoms given by Damman and Behrens (_Veterinary\r\nJournal_, 1906) were vertigo, tympany, and falling, with death in most\r\ncases. Mosselmann (_Vet. Jour._, 1908) observed the symptoms due to the\r\ningestion of a small quantity of the beans by six head of cattle. They\r\nwere: great excitement, salivation, swelling, slight diarrhœa, quick\r\npulse and respiration, muscular spasms, and paralysis of the hind\r\nquarters in one instance; all recovered rapidly.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n              5, 38, 76, 77, 107, 109, 125, 129, 144, 255.\r\n\r\n=Castor Oil Plant= (_Ricinus communis_ L.). The beans (see Frontispiece)\r\nof this exotic are toxic, and poisoning is only likely to occur if they\r\nare sold in error as a feeding stuff, or from the use for feeding\r\npurposes of the press-cake after the extraction of the well-known castor\r\noil, a purgative commonly used medicinally, of which the beans contain\r\nabout 50 per cent. According to Cornevin four seeds suffice to cause\r\naccidents in man, eight lead to very grave results, and beyond that\r\nnumber death may ensue. Pigs and poultry have been poisoned by the\r\nseeds, and M. Audibert (near Beaucaire) reported the death of 80 sheep\r\nfrom eating the press-cake, which is stated to have more pronounced\r\nproperties than the oil. It has been found as an impurity in linseed\r\ncake and maize meal. (_Jour. Roy. Agric. Soc._, 1892.)\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The toxic properties of the bean are due to _Ricin_,\r\na toxin which is similar to bacterial toxins, and the activity of which\r\nis destroyed by heating to 100° C. The beans also contain the alkaloid\r\n_Ricinine_ (C_{8}H_{8}O_{2}N_{2}), the toxic properties of which are\r\nregarded as doubtful. (See Deane and Finnemore, _Yearbook of Pharmacy_,\r\n1905, p. 473.)\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ These usually appear some days after the ingestion of the\r\nbeans or press-cake. There is generally purging. Broad observed in an\r\naffected horse loss of appetite, shivering, cold extremities, dejection,\r\nabdominal pain, constipation, temperature 103° F., pulse 70, and death\r\nin about three days.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                        4, 16, 66, 73, 128, 205.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ROSACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Cherry Laurel= (_Prunus laurocerasus_ L.). This exceedingly common\r\nornamental shrub has caused the poisoning of numerous cattle and sheep\r\non the Continent, but is apparently less harmful in Great Britain—and in\r\nany case animals are not much given to eating the foliage of this shrub,\r\nthe strong smell of the leaves when bruised affording a warning of its\r\nunwholesome character. Gerlach recorded the intoxication of 25 sheep.\r\nBibbey also records the poisoning of 15 sheep by laurel, some of them\r\ndying (_Farmer and Stockbreeder_, Jan. 29, 1912). On the other hand,\r\nHenslow wrote of his cows that they “completely ruined a long laurel\r\nhedge adjoining the field in which they lived; but this abnormal food\r\ndid no harm either to themselves or the milk they produced.”\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ So long ago as 1803 Schrader showed that the cherry\r\nlaurel contains a substance yielding prussic acid. The leaves contain\r\nthe cyanogenetic glucoside _Prulaurasin_ (C_{14}H_{17}O_{6}N), and an\r\nenzyme-emulsin which, by its action on the cyanogenetic glucoside,\r\ninduces the formation of prussic acid, which is the actual cause of\r\npoisoning. The percentage of the glucoside appears to be greatest about\r\nJuly and August. By a microchemical examination Peche has clearly\r\nlocalised hydrocyanic acid compounds in the leaf parenchyma.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ In poisoning by Cherry Laurel there is bloating, inability\r\nto rise, loss of sensation, difficult breathing, convulsions and\r\ndilatation of pupils, and the results may be fatal if unattended to,\r\nprussic acid being formed.\r\n\r\nIn the case of poisoning of ewes Aggio observed (_Veterinary Journal_,\r\n1907) loss of appetite, vomiting, and inability to rise, followed by\r\nseveral deaths. In 1871 Adsetts described (_Veterinarian_, 1871)\r\nsymptoms of poisoning in the horse: indistinct and feeble pulse;\r\ncongested mucous membranes, difficult respiration, uneasiness,\r\nprostration, coldness of the extremities, loss of appetite,\r\nconstipation, diminished urination, and acute pain, eventuating in death\r\nin three days. In sheep Bibbey observed salivation, grinding of teeth,\r\nbrain symptoms, paralysis in the back, coma, and death.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n    4, 16, 73, 76, 81, 128, 129, 130, 132, 170, 205, 232, 254, 255.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CUCURBITACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Bryony= (_Bryonia dioica_ L.). This widely distributed hedge climber,\r\nwhich produces large quantities of scarlet berries, is a highly irritant\r\nplant, with an unpleasant odour and a nauseous juice. The large fleshy\r\ntuberous rootstocks have caused the poisoning of whole families who have\r\neaten them in mistake for turnips and parsnips. The berries may tempt\r\nchildren, and cases of poisoning have occurred. Cornevin estimated that\r\n15 berries would cause the death of a child and 40 that of an adult. No\r\ndeaths of domestic animals have been observed in searching the\r\nliterature, but animals may possibly eat it along the hedgerows at times\r\nwhen grass is scarce. Pigs might possibly eat sufficient of the\r\nrootstock, or poultry of the berries, to cause poisoning.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The plant contains the bitter and poisonous glucoside\r\n_Bryonin_ (C_{34}H_{48}O_{9}).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The symptoms are those resulting from inflammation of the\r\nstomach and intestines, together with convulsions. According to Cornevin\r\nconsumption of the plant promotes sweating, and causes a livid hue,\r\nnausea, diuresis and abundant painless, watery defæcation, to which are\r\nadded in cases of poisoning nervous symptoms of stupor and tetanic\r\nconvulsions. There may be superpurgation or a suppression of defæcation.\r\n\r\nLander states that 2 lb. of fresh or 6 to 8 oz. of dried root given to\r\n_horses_ did not cause purging, but there was abdominal pain, loss of\r\nappetite, accelerated breathing, fever, dullness and copious urination.\r\n\r\nCases may end fatally.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                       73, 76, 81, 141, 170, 233.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              UMBELLIFERÆ.\r\n\r\n=Cowbane= or =Water Hemlock= (_Cicuta virosa_ L.). This plant is\r\nundoubtedly exceedingly poisonous, and fatal cases have occurred in both\r\nman and farm live stock. It has been mistaken by man for parsley, celery\r\nor parsnip, with fatal results, many persons having succumbed to it. The\r\nrootstock is attractive to children on account of its sweetish taste.\r\nPott says that either fresh or dry it is poisonous to all animals when\r\nonly a small quantity is eaten, and often causes rapid death. Sheep and\r\ngoats appear to be less readily affected than other domestic animals,\r\nand cattle to be most sensitive. The loss of eleven animals in Brittany\r\nwas noted in the _Veterinarian_ in 1877, and a number of cattle died in\r\nIreland (_Veterinary News_, 1911), death in both cases being due to\r\nCowbane. It is clearly dangerous to grazing animals which have easy\r\naccess to it, especially if ordinary herbage is scarce. Hedrick (Canada)\r\nis quoted as stating that a piece of the root about the size of a walnut\r\nis sufficient to kill a cow in about fifteen minutes; and Müller says\r\nthat the quantity of dried plant sufficient to kill a horse appears to\r\nbe about 1 lb. According to Kanngiesser the mortality in human poisoning\r\ndue to this plant amounts to 45 per cent. of the cases.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The poisonous character of Cowbane has not been fully\r\ninvestigated, and the toxic principles are given as the alkaloid\r\n_Cicutine, with Oil of Cicuta_, and _Cicutoxine_. The last is a bitter\r\nresinous substance classed by Cushny in the picrotoxin group; it occurs\r\nin the dry root to the extent of 3·5 per cent. The toxicity is stated to\r\nvary with season and climate; the rootstock is most poisonous in spring.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ In man the yellow poisonous juice in the rhizome induces\r\nepileptic convulsions, followed by death. The cicutoxine gives acrid\r\nnarcotic symptoms quickly followed by fatal results. The symptoms\r\nusually appear within two hours, and death ensues in half-an-hour to\r\nseveral hours. The symptoms which appear in an hour or so are given as\r\nloss of appetite, salivation, vomiting (in swine), nausea, colic (in\r\nhorse), bloating (in cattle), diarrhœa, irregular pulse and heart,\r\ndilatation of pupils, rolling of eyeballs, vertigo, reeling in circles,\r\ntwisting of neck, falling down, automatic movement of limbs, opening and\r\nshutting of mouth, and death, usually with convulsions, in from half an\r\nhour to an hour after first manifestation of symptoms.\r\n\r\nFor _cattle_, Lander gives hurried respiration, collection of froth at\r\nthe mouth and nostrils, and tympanites. The limbs are extended and\r\nalternately stiffened and relaxed.\r\n\r\nIn his description of the symptoms Esser states that swallowing is\r\ndifficult, the tongue is stiffened, there is salivation, and death takes\r\nplace after loss of consciousness and convulsions.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n     31, 73, 81, 123, 141, 151, 170, 190, 203, 205, 213, 233, 238.\r\n\r\n=Water Parsnip= (_Sium latifolium_ L.). The leaves and especially the\r\nroot of this species are regarded as poisonous, and the plant is\r\ndescribed as “poisonous” by Strasburger.\r\n\r\nAccording to Müller the symptoms resemble those produced by\r\n_Chaerophyllum_ (p. 40). After eating the roots _cows_ showed symptoms\r\nof excitement, leading, in some instances, very quickly to death. The\r\nmilk, according to Cornevin, is of a disagreeable flavour.\r\n\r\nThe related _S. angustifolium_ has also been mentioned as objectionable.\r\nAs regards the toxic principle these plants have not been closely\r\nstudied, and it is not possible to give detailed symptoms.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                           73, 81, 190, 235.\r\n\r\n=Water Dropwort= (_Oenanthe crocata_ L.). This weed of marshes, ditches,\r\nand similar wet spots, has been a frequent cause of loss of stock. Cases\r\nof fatal human poisoning have also occurred, owing to the leaves having\r\nbeen mistaken for celery and the rootstock for parsnips. Several cases\r\nof the poisoning of cattle have been recorded in the veterinary\r\njournals, and sheep and cattle died on a farm near Bristol (_Jour. Roy.\r\nAgric. Soc._, 1898). Horses have also been poisoned. Johnson and Sowerby\r\n(1861) record the poisoning of 17 convicts near Woolwich, the leaves and\r\nroots being eaten in mistake for celery and parsnips respectively. Nine\r\nsuffered from convulsions and became insensible; one died in five\r\nminutes, a second in a quarter of an hour, a third in an hour, and a\r\nfourth a few minutes later, while two more died during the next few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nCornevin says that this plant causes the poisoning of animals every\r\nyear—they eat it willingly, showing an enfeebled instinct owing to\r\ndomestication. The plant is poisonous in all its parts, the root being\r\nthe most toxic, and drying does not destroy the toxic property. Cornevin\r\ngives the following quantities of the fresh root as necessary to poison\r\nvarious animals:—\r\n\r\n               Horse  0·100 per cent. of the live weight.\r\n               Ox     0·125       „       „       „\r\n               Sheep  0·200       „       „       „\r\n               Pig    0·150       „       „       „\r\n               Rabbit 2·000       „       „       „\r\n\r\nHolmes described _Oenanthe crocata_ as the most dangerous and virulently\r\npoisonous of all our native plants (_Pharm. Jour._, 1902).\r\n\r\nOther species of _Oenanthe_ are also poisonous in a less degree—_e.g._\r\n_O. fistulosa_ L., and _O. Phellandrium_ Lamk.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Poehl (1895) obtained from the root of this species\r\nan amorphous neutral product which he designated _Oenanthotoxin_. The\r\nlatest investigation is that by Tutin, who examined entire dried plants\r\ncollected in early spring, and the experiments confirmed the conclusion\r\narrived at by Poehl, that the toxic principle is a neutral resin. A\r\ndark-coloured, viscid resin, insoluble in water, and equal to 3 per\r\ncent. of the weight of the plant, was extracted, and it is stated that\r\nthe neutral portions of the petroleum and ether extracts of this resin\r\nrepresent the toxic principle of the plant. As there is no evidence of\r\nthe homogeneity of this product, and it is probably complex in\r\ncharacter, it was given no name or formula. The fact that it has\r\npoisonous properties was ascertained by administering the various\r\nproducts to guinea pigs _per os_.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ In poisoning by _O. crocata_ the symptoms generally appear\r\nvery quickly, and in serious cases death may follow in from one hour to\r\na few hours. In Tutin’s experiments on guinea pigs the extracts referred\r\nto above rendered the animal hypersensitive in two to four hours, while\r\nmarked convulsions, with trismus soon appeared; the heart-beat became\r\nvery noticeably slow and the convulsions persisted until death ensued.\r\nThere is great restlessness, difficult breathing, convulsions, loss of\r\nsensation, blindness and stupefaction (Müller); Lander says the symptoms\r\nrecall hemlock poisoning, with the addition of green fœtid diarrhœa.\r\n\r\nIn _cattle_, one hour after eating, there is depression and accelerated\r\nrespiration; the conjunctivæ are injected, the eye turns in its orbit,\r\nthe pulse is weak but rapid, and there is foaming. Later, there is\r\ncolic, and spasmodic contractions of limbs and jaws. If the quantity\r\ningested is sufficient to cause death, the animal falls, but still moves\r\nits limbs. There is bellowing, contraction of pupils, insensibility, and\r\ndeath in convulsions—or, if not fatal, cattle may remain paralysed.\r\n\r\nIn the _horse_, the appearance of the symptoms and the course of the\r\nillness are much more rapid and the nervous symptoms are accentuated.\r\n\r\nIf the _pig_ has consumed only a small quantity it soon gets rid of the\r\npoison by vomiting; but if the quantity is considerable there is no\r\nvomiting and death is as rapid as with cyanide poisoning (Cornevin).\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n      10, 14, 73, 81, 141, 146, 170, 190, 205, 209, 213, 235, 246.\r\n\r\n=Fool’s Parsley= (_Aethusa Cynapium_, L.). Much has been written about\r\nthe toxic properties of this weed of cultivated fields, principally\r\nbecause, owing to the fact that the foliage has often been mistaken or\r\nmisused for parsley and the roots for radishes (!), it has been the\r\ncause of human poisoning, though it seems to be one of the least active\r\nof the poisonous Umbellifers. Its poisonous character is undoubted, but\r\nit is unlikely to cause the poisoning of stock, which seem to refuse it.\r\nSome authors regard it as strongly poisonous, but others as more or less\r\nharmless. Johnson and Sowerby cite a case in which a child of five years\r\nold died within an hour after eating the root, and a second death (in\r\nGermany) within twenty-four hours from the use of the leaves in soup.\r\n\r\nThe most complete account of this plant is that by Power and Tutin,\r\nissued from the Wellcome Chemical Research Laboratories in 1905. Many\r\nauthors since 1807 are cited as writing of its poisonous properties, and\r\nof cases of poisoning, two of which terminated fatally. Miller (1807)\r\nsays that “most cattle eat it, but it is said to be noxious to geese.”\r\nBentley and Trimen write that “in all recorded experiments with it on\r\nanimals, it has had poisonous effects.” Dr. John Harley (1876 and 1880),\r\nafter experiments on a child and adults, concluded that the plant was\r\nabsolutely free from the noxious properties attributed to it. In 1904,\r\nhowever, a case of severe poisoning by it was recorded (_Brit. Med.\r\nJour._, July 16, 1904, p. 124).\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ This has for many years been stated to be the\r\nalkaloid _Cynapine_. For their investigation Messrs. Power and Tutin\r\ncollected the plant round London in July and August, with the fruits\r\nstill green, and after thorough chemical examination found 0·015 per\r\ncent. of an _essential oil_ of rather unpleasant odour; 0·8 per cent. of\r\n_resinous substances_; and an exceedingly small amount of a _volatile\r\nalkaloid_ having the peculiar characteristic odour of _Coniine_. The\r\namount of hydrochloride of the alkaloid obtained showed that if the base\r\nwere Coniine it would correspond to only 0·00023 per cent. of Coniine in\r\nthe plant. In a degree this confirms the statement by Walz (1859) that\r\nthe fruit “contains a volatile base, very similar in odour and chemical\r\nbehaviour to Coniine, and probably identical with it.” The investigators\r\nsuggest that the alkaloid is Coniine, and the small amount would justify\r\nthe opinion, but there may be variation in toxic property according to\r\nstage of development and climate. The authors conclude that “it cannot\r\nbe considered improbable that under favourable conditions of growth, the\r\nproportion of alkaloid may be increased to such an extent as to impart\r\nto the plant the poisonous properties ascribed to it.”\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ In a child which died, there were abdominal pain, a feeling\r\nof sickness, and a tendency to lockjaw, and death supervened within an\r\nhour; and in a German case, vomiting, diarrhœa, lockjaw, and death in 24\r\nhours. (Johnson and Sowerby.) The plant causes convulsions and stupor,\r\nwith nausea and vomiting (Henslow).\r\n\r\nThe symptoms observed in _cows_ are loss of appetite, salivation, fever,\r\nuncertain gait, and paralysis of hind limbs (Müller).\r\n\r\nPott refers to a case which occurred in Guernsey among _horses_. Animals\r\nwith white muzzles and feet had diarrhœa, while other horses remained\r\nhealthy. All white places on the body were badly inflamed. Pammel states\r\nthat the plant causes stupor, paralysis and convulsions in domestic\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n             45, 73, 81, 121, 130, 141, 190, 203, 213, 214.\r\n\r\n=Chervils= (_Chaerophyllum_ sp.). No investigation of these plants\r\nappears to have been undertaken, but _C. sylvestre_ L., though eaten by\r\nsome animals, including the ass and the rabbit, is stated by a German\r\nobserver (_vide_ Cornevin) to have caused the death of pigs. Müller\r\nstates that according to the literature both cows and pigs have been\r\npoisoned, even fatally, by _C. temulum_ L. The plants have a strong\r\nodour and acrid taste.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ This, if any, appears to be unknown, though Müller\r\n(1897) says that _C. temulum_ contains in all its parts the little known\r\n_Chaerophyllin_ (? alk.).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The pigs referred to above as having died were said to show\r\nparalysis, dilated pupils, and enteritis, and to refuse food. Postmortem\r\nexamination showed acute gastro-intestinal inflammation. In the case of\r\ncows there are similar symptoms.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                                73, 190.\r\n\r\n=Hemlock= (_Conium maculatum_ L.). This plant, famous from ancient times\r\nas extremely poisonous, has a fœtid, disagreeable odour—a mousy\r\nsmell—especially noticeable when the plant is bruised. It has caused\r\nhuman poisoning in three ways: the seeds have been eaten in error for\r\nanise, the leaves for parsley, and the roots for parsnips.\r\n\r\nAnimals rarely appear to eat this plant, but cases have been recorded.\r\nIt is stated that in the United States many domestic animals have been\r\nkilled by it; and Ewart says that it is responsible for poisoning a\r\nnumber of cows in Victoria. Goats are believed to be largely immune to\r\nthe poison, or are less harmed than other animals, and sheep are stated\r\nto eat the plant with impunity, though cases of poisoning are recorded.\r\nJohnson and Sowerby state that horses have occasionally swallowed\r\nconsiderable quantities without apparent effect, while Cornevin remarks\r\nthat to cause death a horse would need to eat 4 to 5½ lb. of the fresh\r\nplant, or a cow 8¾ to 11 lb.\r\n\r\nHemlock is probably most dangerous to live stock in the spring, when\r\ngreen herbage is least plentiful and the young shoots of hemlock are\r\nfresh and short. Chesnut says that the root is nearly harmless in March,\r\nApril and May, but dangerous later, especially in the first year of\r\ngrowth; but Esser states that it is only poisonous in the spring. The\r\nfoliage is more poisonous before flowering than after, when the\r\npoisonous principle passes to the fruits, which are more poisonous\r\nbefore ripening (three quarters ripe) than afterwards. Pott remarks that\r\nafter eating hemlock cows give milk with a bad taste.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Early in summer the toxic principle appears to be\r\nchiefly contained in the foliage, but later in the fruit, particularly\r\nwhen still green. Among the substances contained in hemlock are the\r\ntoxic alkaloid _Coniine_ (C_{8}H_{17}N), the poisonous _Coniceine_\r\n(C_{8}H_{15}N), _Conhydrine_ (C_{8}H_{17}NO), the alkaloid\r\n_Methylconiine_ (C_{9}H_{19}N), _Pseudoconhydrine_ (C_{8}H_{17}ON).\r\nConiine may be described as an oily, colourless, quite volatile liquid,\r\nquickly turning brown on exposure to the air, and giving a mousy odour\r\nto the whole plant. The amount of Coniine in the fresh leaves is given\r\n(Pammel) as 0·095 per cent., but in the ripe seeds 0·7 per cent. English\r\nfruits contain much more of the total alkaloids than imported fruits.\r\nOwing to the volatile character of the poisons hemlock largely loses its\r\ntoxicity when dried in hay, and is therefore the less likely to prove\r\ninjurious to domestic animals.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Hemlock is a dangerous narcotic plant. Even the smallest\r\nquantities may cause inflammation of the digestive organs, paralysis and\r\ndeath. The general symptoms are salivation, bloating, dilatation of\r\npupils, rolling of eyes; laboured respiration, diminished frequency of\r\nbreathing, irregular heart action; loss of sensation, convulsions,\r\nuncertain gait, falling, and at the end complete paralysis. Death occurs\r\nafter a few hours. The poison acts on the motor nerve endings, causing\r\nparalysis, dyspnœa resulting from paralysis of the pectoral nerves, and\r\nacceleration of the heart from that of the inhibitory fibres of the\r\npneumogastric.\r\n\r\nSmall quantities cause in the _horse_ a little prostration, yawning,\r\nacceleration of pulse, dilatation of pupils and sometimes muscular\r\nspasms of the neck and shoulders. Large quantities cause nausea,\r\nunsuccessful attempts to vomit, gritting of teeth, accelerated\r\nrespiration and dyspnœa, and muscular tremors commencing in posterior\r\nmembers and spreading to anterior members and spine. There is next\r\ndifficulty of locomotion, sweating (but not continual), falling,\r\nparaplegia, then paralysis, loss of feeling, lowering of temperature,\r\nrapid pulse, increasingly difficult respiration, and death from stoppage\r\nof respiration.\r\n\r\nWith _cattle_ there is ptyalism, cessation of digestion, bloating,\r\nconstipation, weakness and stupor. Pregnant cows have been observed to\r\nabort; the milk of cows has an unpleasant flavour. There are bloody\r\nevacuations in some instances in the case of the ox. In cows Chesnut\r\nsays that there was “loss of appetite, salivation, bloating, much bodily\r\npain, loss of muscular power, and rapid, feeble pulse.”\r\n\r\nIn _sheep_ the abdomen is tucked up, the animal has a dazed appearance,\r\nthere is dilatation of pupils, unsteady gait, the hind limbs being\r\ndragged, coldness, and death after a few convulsive movements.\r\n\r\nIn the _pig_ there is prostration and inability to move, coldness, slow\r\nbreathing, livid mucous membranes, imperceptible pulse, paralysis,\r\nparticularly of the posterior members, and no convulsions.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n   4, 16, 52, 53, 73, 81, 82, 91, 128, 141, 161, 203, 205, 213, 238.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n                               ARALIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ivy= (_Hedera Helix_ L.). The berries of the Ivy are said to be largely\r\neaten by certain birds (_e.g._ blackbirds, thrushes, wood-pigeons), but\r\nhave poisoned children. The plant has long been said to be poisonous,\r\nbut no definite case of poisoning of live stock has been discovered;\r\npossibly farm live stock would need to eat a considerable quantity for\r\nserious effects to be induced. Indeed, when keep is short, it is quite\r\ncommon in some districts to see Ivy strewed on the fields for cattle and\r\nsheep to eat, and it is very frequently given to sick animals by country\r\npeople (Garnett).\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ This has not been closely studied, but ivy contains a\r\nbitter principle which is strongly cathartic, emetic and purgative. Ivy\r\ncontains a poisonous glucoside _Hederin_ (C_{64}H_{104}O_{19}) and a\r\nresin (_Gummi hederæ_).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ As suggested above, it is doubtful whether animals have been\r\npoisoned by Ivy. Symptoms given appear to refer to children, and consist\r\nin sickness, diarrhœa, nervous symptoms, excitement at first, then\r\nconvulsions and paralysis (Müller). Sickness and purgation (Esser).\r\n\r\nCornevin states that the symptoms are complex, emeto-purgative effects\r\nbeing present, with nervous symptoms resembling those of intoxication,\r\nviz. excitement, then coma, convulsions, uncertain gait, and stertorous\r\nrespiration.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                       73, 76, 81, 130, 208, 240.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CAPRIFOLIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Common Elder= (_Sambucus nigra_ L.) and =Dwarf Elder= (_S. Ebulus_ L.).\r\nThese two plants are usually avoided by stock, no doubt in view of their\r\nodour, more particularly in the case of the latter species. The bark,\r\nleaves and berries of both species were noticed by Cornevin as having\r\npronounced purgative properties, and the berries of _S. Ebulus_ as\r\nhaving poisoned turkeys. Esser remarks that the use of _S. Ebulus_ by\r\ncountry folk as a purgative has caused fatal poisoning. The leaves of\r\n_S. nigra_ have caused severe irritant poisoning in a child.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Some doubt exists as to the poisonous principle\r\nof the Elders, the leaves of which contain _Sambunigrin_\r\n(C_{14}H_{17}O_{6}N), a cyanogenetic glucoside; the alkaloid\r\n_Sambucine_; and a purgative principle. According to Cornevin drying\r\nreduces the toxicity but does not destroy it.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The symptoms are not very definite, but small quantities\r\ncause purgation, while large quantities induce depression and violent\r\nemetic and cathartic effects, with diarrhœa, abundant diuresis and\r\nacceleration of pulse. The leaves of _S. Ebulus_ have caused vomiting,\r\nobstinate constipation and enteritis in a boy, and in the case of\r\nanother boy the flowers caused vertigo and headache.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                          4, 73, 81, 203, 233.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               COMPOSITÆ.\r\n\r\n=Tansy= (_Tanacetum vulgare_ L.). Live stock are most unlikely to eat\r\nthis plant, as it is bitter and acrid. Cattle appear to have been\r\npoisoned by it in Germany, Kobert’s opinion being that death had\r\nresulted from tansy. There have also been many serious cases of human\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Tansy contains the bitter, volatile and poisonous\r\n_Oil of Tansy_.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Tansy Oil has been employed as an abortifacient, and\r\nproduces convulsions, violent spasms, frequent and feeble pulse, and\r\nparalysis of the heart and lungs, inducing a condition similar to that\r\nobserved in rabies.\r\n\r\nPammel cites cases of the action of the oil from the plant on _dogs_.\r\nAccording to Pott the tansy imparts a bitter taste to the milk of cows\r\nwhich eat it.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                          161, 203, 204, 213.\r\n\r\n=Ragwort= (_Senecio Jacobœa_ L.). No suspicion appears to have been\r\nfocussed on Ragwort in Britain, but it must be recorded here as the\r\ncause in Canada of the Pictou cattle disease, or hepatic cirrhosis, a\r\nsomewhat fatal disease which has caused much loss during the last few\r\nyears. In New Zealand also the same disease has been experienced, and\r\nhas caused considerable mortality among sheep. In one case sheep were\r\nclosely pastured on about 4000 acres with the object of eradicating the\r\ntoo prevalent weed, but after a year losses ensued. Gilruth concluded\r\nthat if the weed does not monopolise the ground, sheep may, with few\r\nexceptions, eat it daily without suffering ill effects. Cattle and\r\nhorses avoided it when possible.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that in Britain feeding the young shoots off with\r\nsheep, which seem to like the plant, is regarded as the best plan of\r\nreducing Ragwort in grass land. So far there seems to be no record of\r\ninjury from this cause.\r\n\r\nIn South Africa cirrhosis of the liver in cattle (locally termed Molteno\r\ncattle sickness) has been traced to _S. latifolius_, 8 to 10 lb. of\r\nwhich in daily feeds of 2 to 6 oz. caused death in about six weeks.\r\nAnother species, _S. Burchellii_, is similarly poisonous, ½ lb. daily\r\nfor four days having killed an ox on the fifth day; at Molteno half the\r\nquantity proved fatal. Both species are fatal to cattle and horses.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ As regards _S. Jacobœa_ nothing appears to be known\r\nas to any toxic principles, though an alkaloid has been isolated by Watt\r\n(1911), but not fully described. The South African _S. latifolius_,\r\nhowever, was examined at the Imperial Institute, and two new crystalline\r\nalkaloids were isolated—_Senecifoline_ (C_{18}H_{27}O_{8}N) and\r\n_Senecifolidine_ (C_{18}H_{25}O_{7}N)—1·20 per cent. being present in\r\nthe plant before flowering and 0·49 per cent. after flowering.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ As they may to some extent serve as a guide in relation to\r\npossible Ragwort poisoning in Britain the symptoms observed from\r\npoisoning by the South African species may be given: Severe and strained\r\npurging: fæces yellowish to dark brown; cows cease to give milk;\r\nabdominal pain, groaning; animal may go mad and charge anyone\r\napproaching, or lie with outstretched head, drooping ears, staring coat,\r\nand dull glaring eyes; death usual within three days from commencement\r\nof purging. The post-mortem shows an inflamed fourth stomach; hardened\r\ncondition of the liver, often dull grey with spots in the interior;\r\nexpanded gall bladder, with dull yellow viscid bile.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                           43, 128, 195, 260.\r\n\r\n=Wild Lettuce= (_Lactuca_ sp.). Just how far the two species _L.\r\nscariola_ L. and _L. virosa_ L. are really poisonous is not clearly\r\nknown, and it is probable that to be seriously harmful to farm live\r\nstock they would need to be ingested in considerable quantity, and this\r\nthey never seem to be. They are certainly not actively poisonous, though\r\nBailey and Gordon say that “we have been informed that this European\r\nplant—now a national pest—is sometimes eaten by cattle, on whom it has\r\nbeen observed to have had an injurious effect.”\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Authorities differ as to the substances to which the\r\ntoxic property, if any, is to be attributed. According to Ludwig the\r\nmilky juice, known as _Lactucarium_, includes _Lactucone_, _Lactucin_,\r\nand _Lactucic Acid_, the second of these being the narcotic substance.\r\nNearly half the weight of _Lactucarium_ (a form of dried juice) consists\r\nof the tasteless inodorous _Lactucone_ or _Lactucerin_ (C_{14}H_{22}O),\r\nand the bitter taste is due to _Lactupicrine_, Lactucin and Lactucic\r\nAcid. In the leaves of _L. virosa_, Dymond found traces of _Hyoscyamine_\r\nor a similar substance (_Jour. Chem. Soc._, 1892, Vol. 61, p. 90).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Intoxication is produced similar to that caused by poppy\r\nheads; the narcotic effects are dominant (Cornevin).\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                       11, 73, 81, 130, 213, 240.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ERICACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Rhododendron= (_Rhododendron_ sp.). The literature points to there\r\nbeing no doubt as to the poisonous character of a number of species of\r\n_Rhododendron_, and indeed most species are suspected. Animals do not\r\nappear to eat Rhododendrons very extensively, but both English and\r\nBelgian veterinary surgeons have published records of poisoning of sheep\r\nand goats by _R. ponticum_. Suspected cases were recorded in the\r\n_Journal of the Board of Agriculture_ (1907 and 1914); three cases of\r\ncattle poisoning in the _Veterinary Record_ (1900, 1906, and 1907); one\r\nof calves in the _Veterinarian_ (1859); and three of sheep-poisoning—one\r\nin the _Veterinary Journal_ (1906), and two in the _Veterinarian_\r\n(1865); but these cases were not all fatal. The death of 19 out of 21\r\ncross-bred Scotch lambs due to eating _R. ponticum_ was reported by C.\r\nT. Baines in the _Journal of the Land Agents Society_ (Aug. 1914, p.\r\n373). The plant was eaten after a heavy fall of snow. Chesnut includes\r\n_R. maximum_ as one of the thirty most poisonous plants of the United\r\nStates. According to Cornevin, _R. ferrugineum_ causes frequent\r\npoisoning of animals which graze on the plateaux where it\r\ngrows—especially sheep and goats, the latter providing the most victims,\r\nas they willingly browse the young shoots and leaves. _R. californicum_\r\nis said to be poisonous to sheep in Oregon. _R. Chrysanthum_, the leaves\r\nof which have been used in Russia and Germany for rheumatism, has caused\r\npoisoning in man. _R. punctatum_ and _R. hirsutum_ appear to be not less\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\nBoth leaves and flowers are narcotic, and even the honey in the flowers\r\nis regarded with suspicion. The following quotations are not without\r\ninterest:—\r\n\r\n“In these regions (Tungu) many of my goats and kids had died foaming at\r\nthe mouth and grinding their teeth, and I have discovered the cause to\r\narise from their eating the leaves of _Rhododendron cinnabarinum_ (“Kema\r\nKechoong,” Lepcha; Kema signifying Rhododendron); this species alone is\r\nsaid to be poisonous, and when used as a fuel it causes the face to\r\nswell and the eyes to inflame, of which I observed several instances.”\r\n(Hooker, _Himalayan Journals_, ii. p. 150).\r\n\r\n“_Rhododendron arboreum_ becomes plentiful at 5000 to 6000 feet (East\r\nNepal), forming a large tree on dry clayey slopes.... In the contracted\r\nparts of the valley the mountains often dip to the riverbed in\r\nprecipices of gneiss under the ledges of which wild bees build pendulous\r\nnests looking like huge bats suspended by their wings; they are two or\r\nthree feet long and as broad at the top whence they taper downwards; the\r\nhoney is much sought for except in spring, when it is said to be\r\npoisoned by Rhododendron flowers just as that eaten by the soldiers in\r\nthe retreat of the Ten Thousand was by the flowers of _R. ponticum_.”\r\n(_l.c._ i. p. 200).\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The leaves and flowers contain a bitter poisonous\r\nglucoside, _Andromedotoxin_ (C_{31}H_{50}O_{10}), which has been\r\nregarded as more poisonous than Aconitine. Other glucosides found in\r\nRhododendrons are _Ericolin_ (C_{34}H_{56}O_{21}), _Arbutin_\r\n(C_{12}H_{16}O_{7}), and _Rhododendrin_ (C_{16}H_{22}O_{7}), but it is\r\nnot clearly shown whether these are poisonous when ingested; Kobert,\r\nhowever, includes the two former among cerebro-spinal poisons.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ In the case of goats Cornevin records intense pain,\r\ndiarrhœa, discomfort, gritting of teeth, salivation, and frequently\r\nvomiting; while there is reduced lactation, trembling, spasms, vertigo,\r\nloss of power, and death. Lander notes similar symptoms in cattle and\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nAccording to Eve (_Veterinary Record_, 1907), a reddish colour was\r\nobserved in the milk of a cow poisoned by Rhododendron.\r\n\r\n                               REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n 4, 16, 53, 63, 73, 76, 81, 144, 161, 170, 203, 205, 211, 212, 213, 231,\r\n                                252, 264.\r\n\r\n=Azalea= (_Azalea_ sp.). A suspected case of poisoning was recorded in\r\nthe _Journal of the Board of Agriculture_ in 1907. No British record of\r\npoisoning has been found. Various species of Azalea (_A. pontica_, _A.\r\nindica_, _A. arborescens_, _A. nudiflora_, etc.) are stated to be very\r\npoisonous to all animals which browse on them in the East. Cuttings\r\nshould never be thrown down where they can be eaten by stock.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Little work has been done on these plants, but they\r\nare believed to contain _Ericolin_, _Arbutin_, and _Andromedotoxin_ as\r\nin the case of rhododendrons (p. 47).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Azaleas appear to be narcotic, and to produce symptoms\r\nresembling those caused by _Lolium temulentum_ (Cornevin).\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                           73, 144, 190, 205.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PRIMULACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Scarlet Pimpernel= (_Anagallis arvensis_ L.). Unless it occurs in very\r\nconsiderable quantity this little plant is unlikely to be eaten to an\r\nextent sufficient to cause definite poisonous symptoms, as it is a\r\ncornfield weed. It may be taken, however, if animals are allowed to run\r\nover stubble. Sheep are said to refuse it in general, but have died from\r\neating it (see below).\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no doubt that if eaten in sufficient quantity it has a\r\npoisonous action, having an irritant action on the digestive tract—the\r\nintestines—as well as producing narcotic effects. Strasburger notes it\r\nas “slightly poisonous”; Bailey says “a dog is stated to have been\r\ndestroyed by making it swallow three drachms of the extract,” while\r\naccording to Hyams the fluid extract in 4 drachm doses is fatal to dogs\r\n(the size of the dog is not mentioned!); at the Veterinary School at\r\nLyons horses were intentionally killed by administering a decoction of\r\nthe plant; in America Chesnut notes it as suspected of killing a horse;\r\nEwart says it “has been reported to render the chaff from oat crops\r\ninfested by the weed unpalatable to stock”; and Gilruth states that a\r\nyear or two ago it was responsible for the death of a large number of\r\nsheep in Victoria, apparently acting as a narcotic poison (_Amer. Vet.\r\nRev._, July, 1913, p. 383.). On the Pacific coast the plant is known as\r\n“Poison Weed.” Grognier and Orfila are stated to have put its poisonous\r\nproperties beyond doubt.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The plant contains the glucoside _Cyclamin_\r\n(C_{20}H_{34}O_{10}), and a saponin-like substance (Pammel). Van Rijn\r\nsays it contains two glucosides.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The plant has an irritating effect on the intestines and a\r\nstupefying effect on the nervous system. Cornevin states that it is\r\nnever taken by the larger domestic animals in quantity sufficient to\r\ncause poisoning.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                    10, 73, 82, 190, 203, 235, 252.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                OLEACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Privet= (_Ligustrum vulgare_ L.). The facts as to the poisonous\r\ncharacter of Privet are by no means clear, but Taylor records a case in\r\nwhich three children who ate the berries were attacked by violent\r\npurging, and a boy and girl died. Turner observed a case in which horses\r\ndied after eating Privet.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The Privet is stated to contain the poisonous\r\nglucosides _Ligustrin_ and _Ligustron_, not mentioned by Van Rijn,\r\nwho says it contains _Syringin_ (C_{17}H_{24}O_{9}), while Pammel\r\n(1911) adds the bitter glucosidal principle _Syringopicrin_\r\n(C_{26}H_{24}O_{17}).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ In horses Turner observed loss of power in the hind limbs,\r\nwith a pulse of 50, temperature 102° F., slightly injected mucous\r\nmembranes, and dilated pupils, with death in 36 to 48 hours. The berries\r\nare stated by Müller to cause sickness and diarrhœa.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                        130, 190, 203, 233, 252.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CONVOLVULACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Bindweeds= (_Convolvulus sepium_ L. and _C. arvensis_ L.). The creeping\r\nrootstocks and foliage, as well as the seeds, are held to be more or\r\nless poisonous if eaten in quantity, and as long ago as 1872 Olver\r\nrecorded (_Veterinarian_, 1872) that pigs which ate freely of\r\n_Convolvulus_ died. These species, when eaten in considerable quantity,\r\nappear to be cathartic and purgative, causing symptoms resembling those\r\ndue to jalap.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                        82, 141, 190, 203, 254.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SOLANACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Thorn Apple= (_Datura Stramonium_ L.). This species is an escape from\r\ncultivation, but on occasion occurs plentifully in gardens, and if\r\nallowed to seed may escape to arable fields and find its way to stock,\r\nthough it does not appear to have done so in Britain. Several species of\r\n_Datura_ are recognized as virulent poisons in North America, where they\r\nare known as Jimson Weeds. All parts are poisonous, especially the\r\nseeds, which have a somewhat sweetish taste, and have frequently caused\r\naccidents to children who have eaten them. Cases are recorded in the\r\nUnited States in which cattle have been poisoned by eating the leaves of\r\nyoung plants in hay. Live stock, however, usually avoid the plant, which\r\nhas an unpleasant odour and taste, while the seeds are enclosed in\r\nthorny capsules. Walsh states that the seeds are very fatal to young\r\nostriches. Drying does not destroy the toxicity.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The Thorn Apple is usually stated to contain the\r\nhighly poisonous narcotic alkaloid _Daturine_, but this appears to be a\r\nmixture of the two alkaloids _Hyoscyamine_ (C_{17}H_{23}O_{3}N) and\r\n_Atropine_ (C_{17}H_{23}O_{3}N), which, together with the alkaloid\r\n_Scopolamine_, or _Hyoscine_ (C_{17}H_{21}O_{4}N), have been found in\r\nthe plant, the principal constituent being Hyoscyamine. In some analyses\r\nas much as 0·33 per cent. of Atropine has been found in the seeds, and\r\n0·2 per cent. in the leaves (Pammel). The three alkaloids occur together\r\nto the extent of 0·48 to 3·33 per cent. in the leaves, 0·43 per cent. in\r\nthe flowers, and 0·1 per cent. in the root, Hyoscyamine predominating\r\n(Esser). An investigation conducted at the Imperial Institute (_Bul.\r\nImp. Inst._, 1911) showed the amount of alkaloids in European specimens\r\nto be:—\r\n\r\n                     Seeds  0·21 to 0·48 per cent.\r\n                     Leaves up to 0·4        „\r\n                     Stems  average 0·22     „\r\n                     Roots  average 0·17     „\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The general effect of _Datura_ poisoning appears to resemble\r\nthat of _Atropa Belladonna_, but is by some considered more rapidly\r\neffective. There is paralysis, dilatation of the pupils, suspension of\r\nsecretion and of the inhibitory fibres of the vagus, leading to rapid\r\naction of the heart (Lander). Poisoning may terminate fatally. Pammel\r\nquotes Winslow as stating that two grains of Atropine produce mild toxic\r\nsymptoms in the horse; cattle are as susceptible as horses, though\r\nherbivora are not so easily influenced as carnivora. Chesnut gives the\r\nfollowing symptoms: “Headache, vertigo, nausea, extreme thirst, dry,\r\nburning skin, and general nervous confusion, with dilated pupils, loss\r\nof sight and of voluntary motion, and sometimes mania, convulsions, and\r\ndeath.” Walsh gives the toxic symptoms in ostriches as staggering gait,\r\nspasmodic jerking of the neck, stupor, and death in a comatose state.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n    4, 10, 16, 39, 52, 53, 73, 81, 92, 128, 141, 170, 203, 213, 260.\r\n\r\n=Henbane= (_Hyoscyamus niger_ L.). The poisonous character of Henbane is\r\nwell known, but the plant is by no means common (except in Ireland),\r\nthough found in parts of England, Scotland, and Wales. Poisoning of live\r\nstock may occasionally occur, but the disagreeable odour is likely to\r\nprevent all but abnormal or very hungry animals from touching it. The\r\nseeds are eaten by birds, apparently without injury, but poisoned\r\nchickens which ate the ripe seeds in Montana. Cornevin records that cows\r\nhave been poisoned by eating the plant when given mixed with other\r\nherbage. There are numbers of cases of children having been poisoned by\r\neating the seeds. The root has also caused accidents by being taken for\r\nother herbs, and the young shoots and leaves have been used in error as\r\na vegetable. A case was reported in the press in 1910 in which 25 men\r\nand women visitors at a Davos pension suffered from the effects of\r\neating the root of Henbane given in error for horse-radish, or mixed\r\nwith it. All suffered from strange hallucinations, but with prompt and\r\ncareful treatment all had recovered in twelve hours. Kanngiesser says\r\nthat poisoning by this plant very seldom terminates fatally.\r\n\r\nWelsby records a case in which animals were poisoned in a field in which\r\nHenbane was grown for medicinal use some years before (_Veterinary\r\nRecord_, 1903). According to Rodet and Baillet (_vide_ Cornevin) small\r\nquantities of the seeds are in some countries mixed with the food of\r\nfattening stock; if true that fattening is promoted, it is probably due\r\nto the inducement to quiet and repose caused by the narcotic properties\r\nof the seeds.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Poisoning by Henbane is due to the alkaloids\r\n_Hyoscyamine_ (C_{17}H_{23}NO_{3}) and the closely related _Hyoscine_,\r\nor _Scopolamine_ (C_{17}H_{21}O_{4}N). The glucoside _Hyoscypicrin_ is\r\nalso found in Henbane. The poisonous property is not eradicated by\r\ndrying or boiling. The leaves of Henbane grown in Europe contain from\r\n0·04 to 0·08 per cent. of total alkaloid, and the seeds 0·06 to 0·10 per\r\ncent. (_Bul. Imp. Inst._, 1911).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Henbane is an anodyne, and hypnotic. The symptoms resemble\r\nthose caused by _Atropa Belladonna_ (p. 58). The important differences\r\n(Cornevin) are that there is here abundant salivation and no dryness of\r\nthe mouth as in _Atropa_. There is dilatation of the pupils; and\r\nmydriasis, which is dissipated more slowly than in Belladonna poisoning.\r\n\r\nFurther differences in the action of the two poisons are given by\r\nWinslow (_via_ Pammel): The tetanic stage succeeding spinal paralysis\r\nobserved in Atropine poisoning does not ensue with Hyoscine. The latter\r\nalkaloid slightly depresses and slows the heart and does not paralyse\r\nthe vagus terminations, nor depress the motor and sensory nerves or\r\nmuscles. The circulation is but slightly influenced, and vasomotor\r\ndepression only occurs in the later stage of lethal poisoning. Death\r\noccurs from paralysis of the respiratory centres. Poisoning in animals\r\nis exhibited by loss of muscular power, slowing and failure of\r\nrespiration, stupor, and asphyxia. The pulse may be infrequent, the\r\npupils are dilated, and the skin is moist rather than dry.\r\n\r\nThe following symptoms in animals are given by Welsby: Nervo-muscular\r\nexaltation, eyelids and irides much dilated, eyes amaurotic and very\r\nbright, pulse full, temperature normal, respiration difficult and\r\nhurried, profuse salivation, muscles of neck and extremities in a state\r\nof tetanic rigidity, considerable abdominal distension, stercoraceous\r\nand renal emunctories entirely suspended, death.\r\n\r\nIn a _cow_ there was observed, two hours after eating, dilatation of\r\npupils, the conjunctivæ were injected, and the carotids beat violently.\r\nThere were general convulsions, loud respiration, salivation, and\r\npurgation. According to Pott the milk of affected cows is of an\r\nunpleasant taste.\r\n\r\n                               REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n 4, 16, 39, 57, 68, 73, 81, 128, 141, 151, 157, 161, 190, 203, 205, 213,\r\n                                   257.\r\n\r\n=Garden Nightshade= (_Solanum nigrum_ L.). This species is described as\r\n“one of the widest spread weeds over every part of the globe, except the\r\nextreme north and south; varying so much in warmer regions as to have\r\nbeen described under more than forty names” (Bentham and Hooker). In the\r\nsame way there can be no doubt that, though it must always be regarded\r\nas poisonous, this plant varies considerably in toxicity according to\r\nsoil, climate, and general condition of growth. For this reason the\r\nplant may sometimes be eaten in considerable quantities without ill\r\neffects, while in other cases it will undoubtedly prove poisonous.\r\n\r\nChildren have been poisoned by the berries, but may on occasion eat them\r\nwith no other ill effect than a stomach ache, or, if eaten in excess,\r\nsickness and purging. The berries “have even been used instead of\r\nraisins for plum puddings with no effects out of the ordinary” (Ewart).\r\nThe plant has also been used in Queensland and elsewhere as a substitute\r\nfor spinach. In several cases the plant has proved fatal. Gohier gave 3\r\nkilogrammes (6½ lb.) of the green plant to a horse and observed no\r\nserious symptoms. Cases of poisoning are recorded for calves, sheep,\r\ngoats and pigs (Chesnut and Wilcox). According to Lehmann, Schraber and\r\nHaller, the berries are poisonous to ducks and chickens. Over thirty\r\nyears ago the death of a number of cattle in Victoria was recorded as\r\nbeing due to poisoning by this weed.\r\n\r\nThough cases of poisoning of stock are rare, partly perhaps because the\r\nplant is a weed of arable land and partly because animals are likely to\r\navoid it unless starved, _Solanum nigrum_ must be regarded as a\r\npoisonous plant, any examples of which may prove toxic. The downy and\r\nmore prostrate form has been considered the most poisonous.\r\n\r\nThe “Wonderberry,” said to be a hybrid between _Solanum guineense_ and\r\n_S. villosum_, which are probably varieties of _S. nigrum_, cannot in\r\nEngland be distinguished from the last named, the fruits of which appear\r\nto be edible in some countries and poisonous in others. Greshoff found\r\nthat fruits of the “Wonderberry” contained more Solanine than the wild\r\nEnglish _S. nigrum_ or the Canadian form known as the “Huckleberry,” and\r\nhence they should not be eaten.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The Garden Nightshade, in particular the berries,\r\ncontains the alkaloidal glucoside _Solanine_, of which the formula is\r\nconsidered doubtful. Solanine is readily converted into sugar and the\r\npoisonous _Solanidine_. It was isolated from the berries in 1821, and\r\nthough decidedly active in sufficient quantity is not a violent poison.\r\nA small quantity of _Solanine_ is present in the stem and berries, but\r\nthese are probably less poisonous than green potatoes (p. 54).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The symptoms of poisoning are apparently much the same in\r\nman and animals: “Stupefaction; staggering; loss of speech, feeling, and\r\nconsciousness; cramps and sometimes convulsions. The pupil is generally\r\ndilated.”\r\n\r\n                               REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n 4, 10, 11, 16, 17, 52, 53, 57, 73, 81, 82, 128, 141, 161, 203, 235, 240.\r\n\r\n=Bittersweet= (_Solanum Dulcamara_ L.). Some doubt exists in regard to\r\nthe toxic character of this common denizen of the hedge-row, some\r\npersons regarding the berries as harmless and others as poisonous.\r\nPossibly the plant varies in toxicity. Floyer states that 30 berries\r\nkilled a dog. Though stock rarely touch the plant there seems to be no\r\ndoubt that it is poisonous, stem, leaves, and berries containing the\r\ntoxic alkaloid found in _S. nigrum_ and the potato (_q.v._), and it is\r\nespecially possible that poisoning may follow the ingestion of the\r\nberries. Johnson and Sowerby (1861) say that the leaves are narcotic,\r\ncausing nausea and giddiness, and that the fruit is equally harmful,\r\nthough no fatal cases then seemed to be recorded. Gillam records (_Vet.\r\nRecord_, 1906) a case of poisoning of sheep. An anonymous writer in the\r\n_Mark Lane Express_ (July 24, 1911) states emphatically that this plant\r\nis very poisonous, and that he has known 14 per cent. of the sheep on a\r\nfarm to be killed by it in a year, while his veterinary surgeon had had\r\n40 cases that season, some proving fatal.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Like _S. nigrum_, the stems, leaves, and berries of\r\nBittersweet contain _Solanine_. The berries are stated by Esser to\r\ncontain 0·3 to 0·7 per cent. of Solanine. The stems also contain the\r\nglucoside _Dulcamarin_ (C_{22}H_{34}O_{10}), which imparts a bitter\r\ntaste to the plant, but which has not been fully studied.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ In the case recorded by Gillam (see above) the symptoms\r\nobserved in sheep were small intermittent pulse, temperature 104° F.,\r\nquickened respiration, staggering gait, dilated pupil, and greenish\r\ndiarrhœa. The symptoms appear to be the same in the case of cattle\r\n(_Farmer and Stockbreeder_, July 10, 1911).\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n          4, 16, 40, 50, 52, 73, 81, 141, 147, 203, 213, 257.\r\n\r\n=The Potato= (_Solanum tuberosum_ L.). Though potato haulm is more or\r\nless commonly utilised on the Continent as a green fodder, and has been\r\nso used in England, yet there are good grounds for the general belief\r\nthat it is not a suitable food for stock. The tubers may in general be\r\neaten with impunity, but, under certain conditions, cannot be regarded\r\nas blameless, since they have caused serious injury. There are certainly\r\nrecords of injury to man from eating Potatoes, and accidents with\r\nanimals have occurred more commonly. “Greened” tubers, and tubers with\r\nyoung shoots appear to be the chief cause of accidents, and, as regards\r\nlive stock, usually when fed raw.\r\n\r\nCornevin knew of no case of poisoning in man, and considered that this\r\nwas probably because man (1) eats only the part poorest in the toxic\r\nprinciple (see below), (2) does not eat the skin, (3) always cooks the\r\ntubers, and (4) rarely subsists only on potatoes for a considerable\r\ntime. He found accidents among _animals_, however, not rare. In fact,\r\neliminating cases possibly due to changes caused by weather, cryptogams,\r\nand ferments, he found poisonings every year unquestionably due to\r\nSolanine, chiefly among cattle. Cows will eat the haulm without trouble\r\nin times of scarcity of green fodder, but to the detriment of their\r\nhealth if such feeding is prolonged.\r\n\r\nMacfadyen showed some time since that old sprouted Potatoes, even after\r\nboiling, are poisonous to horses. In 1896 eleven horses died from eating\r\nin most instances small quantities of spoiled and somewhat sprouted\r\nPotatoes, and two test-horses fed on the Potatoes died. In this case,\r\nhowever, it was conjectured that the poison was probably some organic\r\nsubstance generated by the bacteria or fungi growing on the Potatoes.\r\n\r\nChesnut and Wilcox (1901) recorded the death of six pigs due to eating\r\nsprouted uncooked Potatoes; after cooking the potatoes did not cause\r\npoisoning. With sufficient boiling most of the poison appears to remain\r\nbehind in the water and might be thrown away.\r\n\r\nCases of poisoning of stock by Potatoes appear to have occurred more or\r\nless frequently in Germany. Two such cases were noted in the _Berliner\r\nTierärztliche Wochenschrift_ in 1909, in one of which 64 cows developed\r\nsymptoms of poisoning after being fed on a large quantity of raw tubers,\r\nwhile in the other instance two cows became ill after eating Potato\r\nparings—which, as shown below, contain more Solanine than the “flesh.”\r\n\r\nIn the case of two children who died, F. W. Stoddart, Public Analyst of\r\nBristol, after a post-mortem in one case, gave a very guarded opinion\r\nthat death was probably due to Solanine poisoning, due to eating raw\r\nPotato peel, but was not confident. A most interesting case of severe\r\nbut not fatal poisoning is described in _The Lancet_ (1899). No less\r\nthan 56 soldiers in Berlin were badly affected, until the supply of\r\nPotatoes was stopped, but the men recovered.\r\n\r\nPammel (1911) states that some persons cannot eat Potatoes because\r\npoisonous to them, but such persons must be extremely rare, and\r\nhypersensitive to minimum quantities of Solanine, which is almost if not\r\nquite absent in the “flesh” of Potatoes.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The Potato plant, like the other species of _Solanum_\r\nmentioned above, contains _Solanine_, which occurs not only in the\r\nhaulm, but in the flowers and fruits, and in the peel of the tubers.\r\n_Solanidine_ also occurs ready-formed in the young sprouts of potatoes\r\nto the extent of 1·5 per cent. (Allen). In the case of the soldiers\r\npoisoned in Berlin analysis demonstrated the presence of Solanine to the\r\nextent of 0·038 per cent. in boiled tubers and 0·024 per cent. in raw\r\ntubers, and on an average every man who fell ill had 0·3 gramme of the\r\nalkaloid, a sufficient quantity to produce toxic results. Esser (1910)\r\nstates that in midsummer the haulm contains 0·0925 per cent. of Solanine\r\nbut late in summer only 0·0374 per cent. In the tubers the alkaloid\r\noccurs in the inner layers of the peel to the extent of 0·0124 per\r\ncent., red or pink varieties containing rather more than yellow sorts.\r\nThe same authority says that damp soils tend to a higher percentage of\r\nSolanine than dry soils[3], and that nitrogenous manuring as compared\r\nwith potash tends to an increase of Solanine. In fresh spring shoots 1·5\r\nper cent. of the alkaloid has been found, and the percentage is\r\nespecially high in tubers which have been “greened” by long exposure to\r\nlight. As already stated it is the greened tubers which appear to be the\r\nchief cause of accidents. Tubers with young shoots are richer in\r\npoisonous alkaloids than those which have not yet been sprouted; such\r\ntubers when fed raw to stock may on occasion induce poisoning, unless\r\nfed only in small quantities.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, potatoes grown in a dry sandy soil are stated to\r\n  contain more Solanine than those grown in other soils.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1887 Cornevin remarked that Solanine, though neither very\r\nactive nor very abundant in Potatoes, nevertheless causes accidents, as\r\nit is cumulative, or, to be more exact, is eliminated slowly.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ In poisoning by potato _haulm_, Cornevin records\r\nconstipation, loss of appetite, rise in temperature, accelerated\r\ncirculation, normal respiration, salivation, tumefaction of eyelids,\r\neyes watery, conjunctivæ injected, and hair erect. The skin is covered\r\nwith scabs which exude matter, the skin being cracked. These scabs are\r\nfound especially on the scrotum of male cattle and the udder of female\r\ncattle, but also in the caudal region and round the anus. An examination\r\nof the mouth shows places on the upper jaw which are devoid of mucus and\r\nare purulent at the centre, the mucus round the edges being swollen. The\r\nposterior members are similarly but not so badly affected. Movement of\r\nthese members seems to cause the animal much pain. Defecation is\r\nfrequent, the fæces being liquid and dark in colour. The animals are\r\nrecumbent for a considerable time with the posterior members stretched\r\nout. In the worst cases there is pronounced emaciation.\r\n\r\nAccording to Friedberger and Fröhner (_vide_ Pammel) animals affected by\r\npotato tops show symptoms resembling those of foot-and-mouth disease.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pott the _berries_ cause colic and foul smelling diarrhœa\r\nin _cattle_. A German veterinary surgeon after feeding the green plant\r\nobserved symptoms of delirium, paralysis, and flatulence. In other cases\r\ntrembling and uncertain gait, with paralysis of the spinal cord, have\r\nbeen observed in _cows_.\r\n\r\nIn poisoning by _tubers_ there is depression, loss of appetite,\r\ncessation of lactation, gritting of teeth, profound prostration, with a\r\nremarkable somnolence, but no dilatation of the pupils. The animals\r\nremain recumbent, with closed eyes, and refuse to get up. Respiration is\r\nsomewhat retarded, and the pulse is small and accelerated. There are\r\ndigestive disturbances, tympanitis, diarrhœa succeeds constipation, and\r\nthere is vomiting (where possible). The poisoning is usually fatal.\r\n\r\nWhere a large quantity of sprouted Potatoes has been fed the prostration\r\nbecomes paraplegia, with loss of sensibility, stupefaction, and death.\r\nWhere there is prolonged ingestion of a large quantity of unsprouted\r\ntubers there is prostration, intestinal irritation, rapid emaciation and\r\ndeath in marasmus after an illness of from one to three weeks\r\n(Cornevin).\r\n\r\nPott states that potatoes diseased with wet rot, when fed raw, cause\r\ndigestive troubles, bloating, diarrhœa, abortion, and decrease in milk\r\nyield, with fatal results in some cases. Potatoes diseased with dry rot\r\ncause constipation in sucking pigs, and a “fishy” butter from cow’s\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nLander notices two cases of poisoning of _horses_ by tubers. In the\r\nfirst case the symptoms were a small and weak pulse, normal temperature\r\nand loss of coordination in movements; complete loss of appetite,\r\nexcessive thirst, but inability to drink; mydriasis, stertorous\r\nbreathing, suspension of peristalsis, and slight tremors over the crural\r\nmuscles. In the second case there was a rapid and feeble pulse,\r\ntemperature 103° F., intense congestion of the mucous membranes, and\r\nvery fœtid diarrhœa, terminating fatally.\r\n\r\nIn poisoning of _horses_ after receiving large quantities of raw\r\nPotatoes, Pott records boil-like swellings on the skin, loss of hair,\r\ndiarrhœa, inflammation of the stomach and intestines, skin irritation,\r\nand swollen fetlocks and hocks.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the horses mentioned above (p. 55) it is stated that an\r\naffected animal seems dull, and dies within twelve hours after being\r\nfirst observed, without evincing any sign of pain. The first symptoms in\r\nten cases were weakness and loss of power over the limbs.\r\n\r\nIn _cows_ the symptoms (Müller) are loss of appetite, bloating,\r\ndiarrhœa, staggering, dilatation of pupils, convulsions, loss of\r\nsensation and paralysis. In many cases, however, these symptoms do not\r\nappear, but instead there are outbreaks on the skin of the hind legs\r\nsimilar to those in foot-and-mouth disease. Pott mentions abortion as a\r\nsymptom. After the ingestion of green Potato parings by dairy cows he\r\nremarks catarrh of the stomach and intestines, and bad milk and cheese;\r\nconsumption of diseased Potato parings resulted in the flow of hard\r\nmucus from the mouth, the legs being badly swollen, and covered with\r\nscabs, and the mouth and body covered with boils. Symptoms of paralysis\r\nwere noticed after feeding dirty Potato parings to four cows and four\r\nbulls, and one cow died.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the cows already referred to (p. 55) as poisoned in\r\nGermany, it was remarked as a noticeable feature in both instances that\r\nthere was the appearance of eczema on the hind limbs, causing lameness.\r\n\r\nA case in which _pigs_ were fed on uncooked, sprouted Potatoes is\r\nnoticed by Chesnut and Wilcox; there was slowly progressing paralysis,\r\nwhich became complete after about 24 hours, increased salivation, and a\r\nregurgitation of the stomach contents. According to Pott death may\r\nresult in pigs. The symptoms given by Lander for poisoning in pigs are\r\nloss of appetite, dullness, exhaustion, imperceptible pulse, watery\r\ndiarrhœa, low temperature and comatose condition.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the poisoned soldiers the symptoms were those of acute\r\ngastro-enteritis; rise in temperature to 103° F.; headache, colic,\r\ndiarrhœa, general debility; in some cases vomiting, in others nausea\r\nonly; several men fainted, and one had convulsions; the majority were\r\ndrowsy and apathetic; but all recovered.\r\n\r\n                               REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n 4, 16, 19, 57, 73, 81, 128, 130, 141, 170, 190, 196, 203, 204, 205, 213.\r\n\r\n=Deadly Nightshade= (_Atropa Belladonna_ L.). This plant has long been\r\nknown to be exceedingly poisonous, all parts containing a toxic\r\nprinciple. Both man and domestic animals may be poisoned, though the\r\nlatter are very unlikely to touch the plant. As regards man, children\r\nare most likely to be affected, owing to the attractive character of the\r\nlarge bright black berries. Domestic animals appear to be rarely\r\npoisoned and are less affected than man, and in any case the\r\nsusceptibility of various species—and even individuals of the same\r\nspecies—is very variable. Human beings are most susceptible, followed by\r\nthe cat and dog; the horse is much less so; and the pig, goat, sheep,\r\nand rabbit are little susceptible to poisoning, even on eating the\r\nroot—the most poisonous part (Cornevin). Gohier and others have given\r\nover 2 lb. of the green plant to horses without ill effects, and this\r\nrepeated on three days did not cause marked pathological troubles.\r\nHertwig considered large ruminants to be more sensible than horses to\r\nthe action of Belladonna. It appears to be agreed that small ruminants\r\nare very slightly susceptible to this plant. Birds are considered almost\r\ninsensitive, while rabbits may be fed for weeks on the leaves without\r\npoisoning, as also sheep, goats, and pigs. Horses and cattle are more\r\nsensitive but nevertheless resistant. The poison is no doubt quickly\r\nremoved by the kidneys, since ordinary injection of Belladonna causes\r\nthe usual symptoms. It is stated that the flesh of rabbits and birds\r\nwhich have eaten the plant and have been slaughtered apparently healthy\r\nis poisonous to man.\r\n\r\nOne berry can induce symptoms of human poisoning, and a child died after\r\neating only three berries. Mortality in human cases of poisoning by\r\nBelladonna is given by Kanngiesser as 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Deadly Nightshade is the source of drugs widely used\r\nin medicine, and its properties as regards man have been extensively\r\nstudied. The principal substance present is the alkaloid _Hyoscyamine_\r\n(C_{17}H_{23}O_{3}N), readily converted into _Atropine_\r\n(C_{17}H_{23}O_{3}N); _Scopolamine_ or _Hyoscine_ (C_{17}H_{21}O_{4}N),\r\nand in smaller quantity _Apoatropine_, and _Belladonine_ are also\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAll parts of the plant contain the toxic alkaloids, but in unequal\r\ndegree. The total quantity of the alkaloids is largest in the roots (0·4\r\nto 1 per cent.), which in the fresh state contain no Atropine, but only\r\nHyoscyamine; the leaves and fruits contain less of the alkaloids, and\r\ncultivated plants have been found to be poorer (0·26 per cent.) than\r\nwild (0·4 per cent). The root has been found to be five times as toxic\r\nas the berries. Drying does not destroy the poisonous properties.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ In quantities which are not fatal the symptoms are nausea,\r\ndilatation of pupils, muscular weakness, stumbling, falling, and rising\r\nonly to fall again. These are followed by vertigo, frenzy, and coma\r\n(more rarely). There is a slight slackening in respiration, and an\r\nincrease in the rapidity of the heart’s action. Dysury and constipation\r\nare observed.\r\n\r\nIn fatal quantities the symptoms are more intense and make their\r\nappearance more rapidly. The nausea is accompanied by vomiting, and\r\nthere is almost complete loss of sight. Sensitiveness is at first\r\nincreased but later diminishes and gradually disappears; complete\r\nincoordination of movements; increase in the heart’s action but a\r\ngradually weakening pulse; stertorous, painful respiration; decrease in\r\ntemperature. There is repeated urination at the commencement of the\r\npoisoning, and then dysury. At the approach of death there are muscular\r\ntrembling and clonic contractions. This phase of convulsions is short\r\nbut very clear in some cases: other cases do not leave the deep coma in\r\nwhich they are plunged (Cornevin).\r\n\r\nIn regard to _cattle_, the following symptoms are given by Müller:\r\nInjury to sight, dilatation of pupils, constipation, later bloody\r\nevacuations, pain in hind limbs, rapid pulse, difficult breathing,\r\nrestlessness, frenzy and finally paralysis.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n       4, 16, 61, 73, 81, 128, 138, 143, 151, 157, 161, 190, 205.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n                             SCROPHULARINEÆ\r\n\r\n\r\n=Foxglove= (_Digitalis purpurea_ L.). The Foxglove has been recognized\r\nas poisonous for centuries, and one of its trivial names is Dead Men’s\r\nBells—a name suggestive of the consequences of taking it. It is the\r\nsource of the well-known drug; and cases of human poisoning have been\r\nvery common, though by no means always fatal—indeed, Esser says “seldom\r\nresulting in death.” Animals are not known to touch this plant, but it\r\nmay possibly be included in rough meadow hay, though only one case, in\r\nwhich two cows and a horse became ill after eating hay containing dry\r\nfoxgloves, has come to notice (_Veterinary Record_, 1906). Cornevin,\r\nhowever, experimented on animals, and found the following amounts of\r\nfresh leaves capable of causing death in the animals specified:—\r\n\r\n                 Horse 120–140 grammes (4 to 5 oz.)\r\n                 Ox    160–180    „    (5·5 to 6·5 oz.)\r\n                 Sheep  25– 30    „    (0·88 to 1 oz.)\r\n                 Pig    15– 20    „    (0·5 to 0·7 oz.)\r\n\r\nThe weight of dried leaves would be only one-fourth of these figures.\r\n\r\nAll parts of the foxglove are poisonous, but especially the seeds, and\r\nthe leaves are more active before than after the flowering period.\r\nCultivated varieties are stated to be less toxic than the wild species.\r\nThe effects of poisoning may terminate fatally in a few hours, or if\r\nsmall quantities are taken regularly the poison may be cumulative and\r\ninduce chronic poisoning.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The foxglove contains several poisonous glucosides,\r\ninvestigated by Kiliani, Schmiedeberg, Cloette, Bourquelot, Herzig, and\r\nothers. The following substances are toxic: _Digitalin_\r\n(C_{35}H_{56}O_{14} or C_{36}H_{58}O_{14}) in the seeds and leaves;\r\n_Digitonin_ (C_{54}H_{92}O_{28} or C_{55}H_{94}O_{28}) in the seeds;\r\n_Digitalein_, only in small quantity; _Digitoxin_ (C_{34}H_{54}O_{11})\r\nin the leaves; and _Digitin_. The toxic property of the foxglove is not\r\nlost on drying or boiling.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Digitalis is an active heart poison, and causes nausea,\r\npressure in the region of the stomach, with diminished pulse, darkening\r\nof the field of vision, dizziness, buzzing in the ears, and usually\r\ndilated pupils.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pammel the symptoms in animals are dullness, lassitude,\r\nloss of appetite, nausea, flatulence, diarrhœa; infrequent, full pulse\r\n(reduced 6–10 beats in the horse); and contracted pupils. In fatal cases\r\nthese symptoms are followed by severe colic and tympanites; rapid,\r\nfeeble, dicrotic, irregular or intermittent pulse (120–140 in horses),\r\nwhile the heart may be heard and felt beating wildly and strongly, and a\r\nsystolic blowing murmur can frequently be detected. This is due to\r\nmitral or tricuspid regurgitation caused by irregular contraction of the\r\ncolumnæ carnæ. The pulse is imperceptible because of the failure of the\r\nheart to fill the vessels. The extremities are cold, the eye is\r\nprotruding, and salivation occurs. Bloody diarrhœa is very often present\r\nand the urine may be suppressed. The breathing finally becomes difficult\r\nand death ensues within a few hours, or as late as several days.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the symptoms of poisoning in various animals is\r\ncollected by Lander:—\r\n\r\nHorses. On the first day sleepiness, swollen eyelids, dilated pupils,\r\ninjected conjunctivæ, considerable swelling in submaxillary space;\r\nrespiration normal, temperature 103·5° F.; pulse full, between 65 and\r\n75, very intermittent, being occasionally normal; the second heart sound\r\nfrequently obliterated. On the next day laboured breathing, head\r\nimmensely swollen, tongue greatly enlarged and protruding, pulse 80 and\r\nmost erratic, temperature very slightly up, great restlessness.\r\nRespiration became more difficult and stertorous, tongue and buccal\r\nmembranes livid, jugular standing out.\r\n\r\nA mare experimentally poisoned showed on the _third day_ dullness and\r\nloss of appetite; _fourth day_ nauseated; nose, mouth, and ears cold;\r\nabdomen blown, with colicky pain, and occasional pawing; pupil somewhat\r\ncontracted, pulse firm at axilla and heart, but not perceptible at jaw;\r\nat 4.30 p.m. she was down, much pained, and attempting to roll; pulse\r\n82, but unequal; _fifth day_, pulse, imperceptible at jaw, about 120;\r\nrespiration 25, and very much laboured: lips retracted and saliva\r\ndripping from the mouth; enormous abdominal tympanites, and much pain;\r\nrapid sinking: died _sixth day_.\r\n\r\nCows. Fed erratically, breathed hard, lay down after feeding. Pulse\r\nalmost imperceptible, contracted pupil, and excessive urination.\r\n\r\nPigs. Languid and sleepy: refused to eat or drink, attempting to vomit\r\nand repeatedly passing small quantities of fæces. Urination was scanty\r\nand strained.\r\n\r\nIn a case of poisoning among horses to which Müller refers the animals\r\nhad an exhausted appearance, there was loss of appetite, increasing\r\nthirst, often also colic, and later diarrhœa, urination often in great\r\nquantity, and staggering. Some of the animals died after a few days in\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\n                               REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n 4, 16, 73, 76, 79, 81, 161, 170, 187, 190, 203, 204, 205, 213, 229, 252,\r\n                                   257.\r\n\r\n=Lousewort= (_Pedicularis_, sp.). Two species of lousewort are involved,\r\n_P. palustris_ L. and _P. sylvatica_ L., and though both are regarded as\r\npoisonous the extent to which they are so is not well known. They have\r\nan unpleasant smell and sharp taste, and are in general refused by all\r\nclasses of stock. _P. sylvatica_ may be eaten when young (Cornevin).\r\nLindley says that both plants are acrid, but are eaten by goats. _P.\r\npalustris_ is regarded by Pott as an acutely poisonous plant, especially\r\nfor sheep. A decoction of these plants was formerly used against lice,\r\nand hence the trivial name.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Very little appears to be known about the poisonous\r\nprinciple, but, like _Rhinanthus_ and _Melampyrum_, they have been found\r\nto contain the glucoside _Rhinanthin_ (see p. 96).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The plants are held to be emetic and purgative; to cause\r\ninflammation of the digestive tract, and to cause anæmia in cattle.\r\nBrugmann stated (_vide_ Cornevin) that if, pressed by hunger, animals\r\neat _P. palustris_, the first consequence is hæmaturia. Müller also\r\nnotes hæmaturia.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                       73, 76, 81, 190, 203, 213.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              POLYGONACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Docks= (_Rumex_ sp.). In general it is probable that but little harm is\r\ndone by species of _Rumex_, but owing to the fact that Common Sorrel\r\n(_R. Acetosa_ L.) and Sheep’s Sorrel (_R. Acetosella_ L.) contain acid\r\noxalates they may on occasion prove injurious. Instances have been\r\nrecorded in which children have suffered from eating the leaves of the\r\nformer species in considerable quantity, and both species have been\r\naccused by veterinary surgeons of poisoning horses and sheep, some sheep\r\neven dying. Pammel states that the Curled Dock (_R. crispus_ L.) induces\r\nnausea, watery brown fæces, copious urination, dry spasmodic cough, and\r\nperspiration; but no record of the death of animals has been found.\r\n\r\nIn regard to _R. Acetosella_ it is stated that in the _horse_ a\r\ncondition may be produced resembling drunkenness, with vacillating gait,\r\nsalivation, muscular tremors, dilatation of pupils, relaxation of\r\nsphincters, and a feeble, slow, and intermittent pulse: then convulsive\r\ncontraction of lips, retraction of the eyeball, accelerated and\r\nstertorous breathing, extreme dilatation of the nostrils, tetanic\r\ncontraction of the muscles of the neck, back, and limbs, abundant\r\nsweating and falling. In bad cases after a period of extreme exhaustion,\r\nthese symptoms are repeated, and death occurs in convulsions (Cornevin).\r\n\r\nThe acid oxalates seem especially harmful to _sheep_, causing loss of\r\nappetite, exhaustion, small and scarcely perceptible pulse, rapid\r\nbreathing, and constipation, and in many cases severe diarrhœa,\r\nuncertain gait, and sometimes death (Müller).\r\n\r\nThe milk of affected cows is with difficulty made into butter (Pott).\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                        73, 141, 190, 203, 233.\r\n\r\n=Polygonum= sp. Several species of _Polygonum_ are said to have\r\npoisonous properties. The chief among them is Buckwheat (_P.\r\nFagopyrum_), the grain of which is widely grown as a food for both man\r\nand live stock. This plant, particularly the flowers, has given rise to\r\na well-known rash in man, cattle, sheep, and pigs, with congestion and\r\ntumefaction—especially of the head and ears. There is also nervous\r\ndisturbance, with agitation and hallucination—sheep, for example, may\r\nbutt against objects. The affection of the nervous centres may lead to\r\nfatal results, which have followed in cattle, sheep, and pigs. Little is\r\nknown of this so-called _Fagopyrism_, but after analytical and\r\nspectroscopical researches on the colouring matter of the tegument Kurt\r\nconcluded that it is due to the chlorophyll.\r\n\r\nPersicaria (_P. Persicaria_ L.) and Water-pepper (_P. hydropiper_ L.)\r\nare also stated to be harmful, though the former has been considered a\r\nnutritious plant and has been given to horses and cattle as a green\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nBoth species, however, are said to cause a rash, and to contain\r\ninjurious narcotic substances. Persicaria is stated by Müller to have\r\ncaused inflammation of the bladder and the digestive tract in pigs, and\r\nWater-pepper to have caused hæmaturia; fatal results have followed. Pott\r\nrecords similar symptoms. In regard to Persicaria it should be noted\r\nthat it varies considerably in general form, and may possibly vary also\r\nin acridity. Bentham and Hooker state of _P. hydropiper_ that “the whole\r\nplant is more or less acrid or biting to the taste.”\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                       17, 19, 73, 190, 204, 213.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THYMELACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Mezereon= (_Daphne Mezereum_ L.) and =Spurge Laurel= (_D. Laureola_\r\nL.). Both of these species are acrid and poisonous, and cases of the\r\ndeath of horses due to the spurge laurel are recorded by Lander. In\r\ngeneral, however, animals will not eat the plants, and indeed, in one of\r\nthe cases mentioned by Lander the dried leaves were administered for\r\nworms. Should they touch these plants most animals would probably refuse\r\nthem on account of their bitter taste. The berries are tempting to\r\nchildren, and Pratt says “Death has resulted from eating but a few of\r\nthese berries (_D. Mezereum_); and Dr. Christison relates a case of a\r\nchild, in Edinburgh, who died from eating them, while another is\r\nrecorded by Linnæus of a young lady to whom twelve of the berries were\r\ngiven as a medicine in intermittent fever, and who soon died in\r\nconsequence of their corrosive poison. Four berries produced thirst,\r\nsense of heat in the mouth and throat, and also fever, in a man who ate\r\nthem; and they are proved to be poisonous to dogs and foxes.” Blyth\r\nstates that 30 grammes (1 oz.) of the powdered bark is a lethal dose for\r\na horse, but smaller doses of the fresh leaves may be deadly (Pammel).\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ All parts of these plants are acrid and poisonous,\r\nespecially the bark and berries. They contain the bitter, astringent,\r\nand poisonous glucoside _Daphnin_ (C_{30}H_{34}O_{19}—or C_{15}H_{16}0_9\r\naccording to Van Rijn), an acrid resin (Mezerein), and a _vesicating\r\nfatty oil_. (Pott remarks that Daphnin is believed to be harmless, but\r\nthat Mezerein has poisonous effects.) Drying does not destroy the\r\npoisonous property.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The Daphnes are severely purgative, cause burning in the\r\nmouth and throat, and in severe cases have narcotic effects and give\r\nrise to convulsions.\r\n\r\nLander gives the symptoms as intense colic, constipation, followed by\r\ndysentery and copious evacuations of fæces streaked with mucus, blood,\r\nand intestinal epithelium. Drowsiness between the spasms.\r\n\r\nAccording to Müller there is inflammation of the stomach and intestines\r\n(with colic, vomiting, severe diarrhœa, passing of blood), inflammation\r\nof the kidneys (with strangury, bloody urination), and in many cases\r\nnervous symptoms (weakness, giddiness, and convulsions).\r\n\r\nIn a case observed by Lander, in the horse, there was abdominal pain,\r\nstaggering gait, anxious countenance, laboured breathing, pulse 80,\r\ntemperature 103·2° F., bowels normal. On the following day there was\r\nexcessive purgation, pulse 120, temperature 104·2° F., and death\r\noccurred at mid-day.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n          73, 76, 81, 130, 141, 170, 190, 203, 213, 216, 240.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             EUPHORBIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Spurges= (_Euphorbia_ sp.). Many species of Spurge must be regarded as\r\nacrid, purgative, and poisonous. Live stock are not likely to touch\r\nthem, owing to the acrid effect of the milky juice on the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe Caper Spurge (_E. Lathyris_ L.) contains an acrid, emetic, and\r\nhighly purgative milky juice, and the fruits have commonly been employed\r\nby country folk as a purge, and also as a pickle, though they are\r\ndangerous and should not be so used. Pratt records a case in which five\r\nwomen ate the pickled fruits with boiled mutton, and all suffered severe\r\npain and burning in the stomach, and showed other symptoms attendant on\r\nirritant poisoning—and though all recovered the illness was severe. Used\r\nin this manner, indeed, they have given rise to serious cases of human\r\npoisoning. Only very young animals are said to eat it, but cattle in the\r\nUnited States are said to be “quite resistant to its influence, but they\r\nare sometimes overcome.” According to Chesnut goats eat this plant\r\nextensively, and it is said that their milk then possesses all the\r\nvenomous properties.\r\n\r\nPetty Spurge (_E. Peplus_ L.) is somewhat similar to the Caper Spurge in\r\npoisonous properties, and fatal poisoning has occurred through a boy\r\neating it.\r\n\r\nSun Spurge (_E. Helioscopia_ L.) is similarly poisonous to the preceding\r\nspecies. It has caused fatal poisoning to a boy who ate it. In Germany\r\ncows were poisoned through pasturing in stubble in which the plant was\r\ngrowing, but there were no deaths.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principles._ The milky juice of these spurges contains highly\r\nacrid poisonous substances, which have not been individually and fully\r\ninvestigated. Drying may reduce the toxicity but does not eliminate it.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ As regards _E. Lathyris_ Chesnut says that on the skin the\r\njuice causes redness, itching, pimples, and sometimes gangrene. The\r\nseeds when eaten inflame the mouth and stomach, cause vomiting and\r\nintense diarrhœa, and if the illness is serious, nervous disorders,\r\nunconsciousness, collapse, and death.\r\n\r\nThe _Euphorbias_ have an acrid effect on the mouth, and severe poisoning\r\nmay follow their use as aperients—burning mouth, swelling tongue,\r\nstomach pains, cold skin, vertigo, fainting or syncope, and even death\r\nin two or three days (Esser).\r\n\r\nSimilar symptoms are given by Cornevin, who states that the Euphorbias\r\nhave an irritating effect on the mucous membrane, especially at the back\r\nof the mouth. In from three quarters of an hour to two hours after\r\neating the plant, or even longer, there is painful vomiting, followed by\r\ndiarrhœic evacuations, with a lowering of the temperature. If the\r\nquantity ingested has been sufficient there appear also nervous\r\nsymptoms, vertigo, delirium, muscular tremors, and respiratory and\r\ncirculatory troubles which disappear after abundant sweating if the\r\npoisoning is not fatal. If it is fatal the symptoms of superpurgation\r\nand enteritis predominate, but are accompanied by nervous symptoms and\r\ncirculatory disorders.\r\n\r\nMüller gives in addition loss of appetite, piteous whining (in goats),\r\ngroaning, colic and tympanites; and Pott, bloating, fever, palpitation\r\nof the heart, and loss of consciousness. Cows gave a reddish or\r\nsharp-tasting milk. Milk of affected goats caused diarrhœa human beings.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n            19, 52, 53, 73, 81, 82, 130, 141, 190, 213, 216.\r\n\r\n=Dog’s Mercury= (_Mercurialis perennis_ L.) and =Annual Mercury= (_M.\r\nannua_ L.). These two species may be taken together as they have similar\r\npoisonous properties, and closely resemble one another, though the\r\nformer is a perennial and the latter an annual. The plants have a\r\nsomewhat unpleasant odour, and live stock are not likely to take them\r\nunless pressed for readily available green food. The loss of one cow and\r\nsevere illness of four others was recorded by Blackhurst in the\r\n_Veterinary Journal_ in 1896; Güssow mentioned the loss of cows in the\r\n_Farmer and Stock Breeder Yearbook_, 1907; the loss of horses fed on\r\nherbage cut from a hedge and containing _M. perennis_ was recorded in\r\nthe _Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society_ in 1898; the loss of\r\nsheep was recorded by Henslow. As regards man, Ray records a case in\r\nwhich a family of five persons suffered severely from eating _M. annua_\r\nfried with bacon. Fishermen ate it with soup and all were seriously ill\r\nan hour later, with symptoms of irritant narcotic poisoning; two\r\nchildren died the next day. Cornevin saw _M. annua_ used, after boiling,\r\nas a food for pigs, without ill consequences, in the east of France.\r\nThis is believed to be due to the poison being volatile and destroyed by\r\nheat or boiling; hence in hay the plant is harmless, though Pott says\r\nthat even in hay stock avoid it.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The poisonous properties are said to be due to\r\n_Mercurialine, Oil of Euphorbia_, a volatile toxic alkaloid. Esser\r\nstates that the stem and leaves of _M. annua_ contain _Trimethylamine_,\r\nwhich may perhaps be a decomposition product of _Choline_, a poisonous\r\nbase.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Both plants are emetic and dangerously purgative, causing\r\nirritant and narcotic symptoms. Veterinary observation has shown that\r\nthe poison is cumulative, and that it is usually after the weed has\r\nformed part of the food for 7, 8, or 10 days that symptoms first appear.\r\nIn the case recorded by Blackhurst (see above) the cows suffered from\r\ninflammation of the digestive tract, with severe purging and loss of\r\nblood. The secretion of milk entirely stopped. One cow died, but three\r\nrecovered in about four days. The fifth was not convalescent for three\r\nweeks and then had a permanently curved and injured neck, the muscles\r\nbeing subsequently found rich in fibrous tissue, and the last three\r\njoints partially anchylosed. Rabbits were tested by feeding two on the\r\nleaves, two on the stems and roots, and two on the ground seeds mixed\r\nwith oatmeal; the first two were unaffected, but the other four died in\r\na few hours, showing drowsiness and suffering, while the post-mortem\r\nshowed gastritis.\r\n\r\nThe digestive and urinary tracts are affected. There is indigestion with\r\nslight bloating, then colic of varying intensity, and at first diarrhœa\r\nwhich may give place later to constipation; hæmaturia; micturition is\r\nfrequent, painful, and the urine is blackish and bloody; dullness,\r\nweakness, loss of appetite and refusal of food; the heart beats very\r\nstrongly, the pulse is rapid, and the mucous membrane of the eye is\r\nreddish-yellow in colour. There is no modification of respiration\r\n(Cornevin).\r\n\r\nAccording to Müller, however, the symptoms at _first_ include\r\nconstipation and _later_ severe and bloody diarrhœa.\r\n\r\nIn cattle Pott states that _M. annua_ causes inflammation of the stomach\r\nand intestines, bloody urine, paralysis of bladder, fœtid diarrhœa,\r\nabortion, and bluish coloured milk deficient in fat. Müller states that\r\nthere is occasionally blood in the milk. According to Lander there is in\r\ncows excessive bloody purgation, cessation of lactation, temperature\r\n105° F., pulse 90, and increased respiration. The illness is protracted\r\nover several weeks, the animals being comatose after the first symptoms.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n            73, 81, 112, 130, 146, 170, 190, 205, 213, 255.\r\n\r\n=Box= (_Buxus sempervirens_ L.). Farm live-stock may occasionally have\r\nthe opportunity of browsing on box, or clippings may be thrown to them\r\nwith other green herbage from gardens. Care should be taken that\r\nclippings are otherwise disposed of. All parts of the plant are bitter\r\nand have been proved to be poisonous. The bitter taste tends to prevent\r\nanimals eating sufficient of the plant to cause serious injury. Pigs\r\nhave died a day after eating the leaves. Horses also were killed by\r\neating 750 grammes (1·6 lb.) of the foliage.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principles._ Fauré found in the bark and leaves of box the toxic\r\nalkaloid _Buxine_, but it was believed that there were other toxic\r\nsubstances, since analysis showed the leaves to be less rich in Buxine\r\nthan the bark, while they are three times as active. Other substances\r\noccurring in box are _Parabuxine_, _Buxinidine_, and _Parabuxinidine_.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Small amounts have an emetic and purgative action; with\r\naverage amounts, there are, in addition, nervous symptoms, lameness,\r\nmuscular tremors, vertigo, then a period of coma. Large amounts cause\r\ndeath with intense abdominal pains, dysenteric flux, tenesmus,\r\nconvulsions, respiratory and circulatory troubles.\r\n\r\nPigs are chiefly affected after eating the leaves, exhibiting great\r\nthirst, uncertain gait and delirium, while death occurs within\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nPott gives the general symptoms as sickness, diarrhœa, giddiness,\r\nstupefaction, convulsive movements, and colic.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                  4, 16, 73, 128, 190, 205, 213, 235.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               AMENTACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=The Oak= (_Quercus_ sp.). Injury to stock from the Oak has been due in\r\nthe first place to the leaves, and in the second to the acorns. In\r\nregard to the leaves no injury appears to have been recorded in Britain,\r\nbut Cornevin devotes attention only to poisoning by the leaves, which in\r\nspecial circumstances have caused serious accidents to animals which\r\nhave eaten them. In France, cattle taken to the forests for grazing\r\npurposes browse on the young shoots and leaves of the oak, and after\r\nsome days there arises a trouble long known as _Mal de Brou_ or _Maladie\r\ndes Bois_, which may end fatally, sometimes even in 24 hours (see\r\n_Symptoms_ below). A case was also reported from Nebraska in 1903, ten\r\nhead of cattle having apparently died from eating oak leaves, the\r\ntrimmings from trees. The stomachs were full of the leaves, and the\r\nintestines had the appearance of being burned in places. There was no\r\nevidence of impaction. When the cut branches were removed no more cattle\r\nwere lost.\r\n\r\nSerious losses have been caused through the ingestion of acorns by young\r\ncattle not over about two years old, the years 1808, 1870, 1884, and\r\n1900 being especially noteworthy in this respect. Cattle over three\r\nyears old have seldom been affected, while sheep and pigs, if not immune\r\nto “acorn poisoning,” are but slightly affected. Müller, however, states\r\nthat horses, cattle, sheep, and goats are affected; 9 quarts (10 litres)\r\ntaken in four days were sufficient to cause poisoning in the case of a\r\nbullock. It is believed by some observers that half-ripe acorns—_e.g._\r\nacorns which may drop owing to drought—are more injurious than\r\nthoroughly ripened acorns.\r\n\r\nSome authorities appear to be of the opinion that “acorn poisoning” is\r\nnot actually poisoning, but a serious form of indigestion. If this be so\r\nthe symptoms must be regarded as exceedingly severe. There is no doubt\r\nthat “acorn poisoning” is not well understood, but a great deal has been\r\nobserved and written on the subject, and there is clear evidence that\r\nacorns may reasonably be held to be poisonous. It must be pointed out,\r\nhowever, that the poisoning does not usually follow on the consumption\r\nof acorns in small quantities, but is commonly due to full meals of\r\nacorns taken in periods when there is a dearth of herbage. By proper\r\npreparation and storage acorns have been converted into a most useful\r\nfood for horses, cattle and sheep (_Jour. Bd. Agric._, Sept. 1914 and\r\nFeb. 1916, and Leaflet No. 291 of the Bd. Agric., _The Food Value of\r\nAcorns, Horse-Chestnuts and Beech Mast_). In Germany it has been found\r\nthat acorns fed to fowls caused diminished egg-laying, which finally\r\nceased, while the yolks of eggs laid were discoloured a dirty brown\r\n(_Jour. Bd. Agric._, Dec. 1915, p. 902).\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The facts as to acorn poisoning and oak-leaf\r\npoisoning are not clearly known, and the actual toxic substance is\r\nsimilarly not certainly known. It is probable, however, that it consists\r\nof _Tannin_, or substances which give rise to Tannin.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ In relation to _Maladie des Bois_ due to leaves, Cornevin\r\ngives the symptoms as loss of appetite; less (and more difficult)\r\nrumination; constipation, which increases; lying down, animals looking\r\nat their flank as in colic, followed by rising and attempts to urinate,\r\nwith passing of rosy-coloured liquid in jets; loss of milk production,\r\nwhich may drop to nothing; fever, trembling, enfeebled condition.\r\n\r\nThree or four days after the commencement of illness rumination is\r\ncompletely suspended; there is stamping of the feet, colic, retracted\r\nstomach, pulse hard, heart agitated, accelerated respiration, violent\r\nmuscular shocks, and frequent urination. The urine is always dark in\r\ncolour, but varies from clear red to dark black, nut-brown being usual.\r\nCases are only serious when a fœtid, frothy, and abundant dysentery\r\nsucceeds constipation, in which case there is rapid emaciation and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nUsually the course of the illness is not rapid; but occasionally there\r\nis immediate and bloody urination with violent colic and sometimes\r\nintestinal hæmorrhage, death occurring in 24 hours.\r\n\r\nIn poisoning by _acorns_ there is progressive wasting, entire loss of\r\nappetite, diarrhœa, discharge of an excessive quantity of pale urine,\r\nsore places inside the mouth, discharge from the nostrils, and also from\r\nthe eyes, which are always sunken, giving the animal a peculiar haggard\r\nexpression. There is no fever; on the contrary, the temperature is\r\ncommonly below normal, though in some cases stated to be above normal.\r\n\r\nMüller remarks on the severe constipation, followed by dysenteric\r\ndiarrhœa, caused by acorns, especially when eaten in the half-ripe\r\ncondition, horses, cattle, sheep, and goats being affected.\r\n\r\nThe experimental poisoning of a young steer and a young sheep by fully\r\nripe acorns was described in 1871 (_Jour. R.A.S.E._, 1871). In the steer\r\nthe symptoms were a semi-conscious condition, weak pulse, pallid\r\nmembranes, cold surface of body, torpid bowels, slow breathing,\r\ntwitchings of muscles, and a disposition to maintain a recumbent\r\nposition. Inflammation was entirely absent. The symptoms increased in\r\nseverity day by day; there ensued a copious flow of colourless urine; a\r\nmucopurulent discharge from the eyes and nostrils. No impairment of\r\nhealth followed the feeding of acorns to the sheep.\r\n\r\nThorburn (_Veterinary Journal_, Feb., 1902) mentions loss of appetite,\r\ngrunting, disinclination to move, prostration, icy coldness of\r\nextremities, very rapid emaciation (this sometimes was particularly\r\nnoticeable), pulse very small and weak (in some cases almost\r\nimperceptible), temperature high (105° to 107° F.,) and constipation\r\nsucceeded by watery diarrhœa.\r\n\r\nBrookes and Yeomans described (_Veterinary Journal_, 1912) an instance\r\nin which 30 animals were affected and 9 died. The chief symptoms were a\r\ndull and depressed appearance, entire absence of appetite and\r\nrumination, a weak feeble pulse, subnormal temperature and\r\ndisinclination to move. Three cases showed a mucous and blood-tinged\r\ndischarge from the nostrils and anus, and these all died, one eight days\r\nafter being seen and the other two the day afterwards. Obstinate\r\nstoppage was noticeable in all cases, and the fæces were inky black,\r\nstinking and very thick. Yeomans observed similar symptoms of acute\r\ndigestive disturbance; later the eyes had a sunken appearance, diarrhœa\r\nset in, the fæces being dark coloured, offensive and bloodstained. The\r\ntemperature was at first normal and later subnormal, and in fatal cases\r\ndeath took place in from 3 to 7 days.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n          4, 13, 20, 26, 29, 70, 73, 130, 144, 190, 240, 255.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONIFERÆ.\r\n\r\nThe only Conifer which commonly causes poisoning of live-stock is the\r\nYew, but injury might more frequently occur were it not for the fact\r\nthat Conifers generally are unpleasant to the taste, and are hence\r\navoided by stock. Many species, however, contain _Tannin_, _Resins_ and\r\n_Gums_, _Volatile Oils_, and an acrid substance which may cause\r\ninflammation of the digestive and urinary tracts, while Tanret found in\r\nthe young shoots of _Picea_ the bitter glucoside _Picein_\r\n(C_{14}H_{18}O_{7}H_{2}O); Kawalier and Thal found the intensely bitter\r\nglucoside _Pinipicrin_ (C_{22}H_{36}O_{11}) in _Pinus sylvestris_,\r\n_Thuja occidentalis_ and _Juniperus Sabina_; and Kubel isolated\r\n_Coniferin_ or _Abietin_ (C_{16}H_{22}O_{8}), a slightly bitter\r\nglucoside found in _Abies excelsa_, _A. pectinata_, _Pinus strobus_,\r\n_Larix europæa_ and other conifers. It is not clear, however, whether\r\nthese substances are at all poisonous. It is quite possible that if\r\neaten in quantity the foliage of some Conifers may induce poisonous\r\nsymptoms and even death in the animals concerned. It is noteworthy,\r\nhowever, that according to Pott the needles of _Picea excelsa_, _Abies\r\npectinata_, _Larix europæa_, and _Pinus_ sp. are, in the mountainous\r\ndistricts of Steiermark, Kärnten, and Tyrol, extensively fed to cattle\r\nand sheep, usually as a supplementary food, either fresh or dried and\r\nground up—chiefly perhaps as an appetiser, and in small quantities as a\r\ndietetic; _Juniperus_ sp. are similarly utilised in some districts. It\r\nis not known to what extent the foliage may be fed without harmful\r\nconsequences, but Pott states that large quantities can cause hæmaturia\r\nand similar effects, and hence only small quantities should be used, and\r\neven so may impart a bad flavour to the milk of cows. All green needles\r\nfrequently cause digestive troubles.\r\n\r\nA case has recently (January, 1916) been reported to the author in which\r\na Douglas Fir was cut down and a small branch about 4 ft. long was flung\r\nover into a field. Two sheep nipped off the bark and nearly died, but\r\nboth vomited and recovered. The farmer reporting this experience recalls\r\nthat over 30 years ago, after a gale, a lot of trees were blown down in\r\na small plantation, and in severe weather the sheep ate the bark to such\r\nan extent that 80 of them aborted, while of the ewes which did not eat\r\nthe bark none aborted, so that it would appear that the bark of Scotch\r\nFir and Spruce was to blame for the loss.\r\n\r\nThe foliage of the Yew (_see_ below) is well known to be dangerously\r\npoisonous to stock, and has caused many losses.\r\n\r\nIn regard to _Cupressus_ the only cases of poisoning which have been\r\ntraced are recorded in _The Journal of the Board of Agriculture_\r\n(October, 1905). These cases were reported as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Two instances have recently come before the Board in which the death of\r\ncattle has been attributed to the poisonous effects of _Cupressus\r\nmacrocarpa_ and _C. nootkatensis_. In one case four bullocks died, and\r\non the internal organs being forwarded by the owner to the Royal\r\nVeterinary College, Professor McFadyean reported that from the inflamed\r\ncondition of the fourth stomach and from the description of the symptoms\r\nhe had little doubt that the cause of death was irritant poison. Some\r\npieces of _Cupressus macrocarpa_ were found in their stomachs, and in\r\ndefault of any other explanation it was suggested that this plant might\r\nhave some poisonous properties.\r\n\r\n“In another case three heifers are stated to have suffered from irritant\r\npoison; one of them died, but the other two recovered on removal to\r\nanother field. The veterinary surgeon in this case also attributed the\r\ndeath to a Cupressus (_C. nootkatensis_) growing by the side of the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n“The Board have no information as to the poisonous properties of these\r\ntwo species, nor can any record be found of any similar case which would\r\ntend to confirm the suspicion that they are poisonous to cattle.”\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                       4, 16, 76, 144, 213, 252.\r\n\r\n=Yew= (_Taxus baccata_ L.). As stated above, the Yew is the only British\r\nconifer that is likely to prove seriously poisonous to live stock. It\r\nhas unfortunately caused the death of many horses and cattle, while\r\nasses, mules, deer, pigs, rabbits, and pheasants have also been\r\npoisoned. Many cases of fatal human poisoning have also occurred. For\r\nexample, the poisoning of a horse, and of cattle, horses, and deer were\r\nmentioned respectively in 1885 and 1893 (_Jour. Roy. Agric. Soc._).\r\n“Through eating the poisonous leaves of a Yew tree, four cross-bred\r\ncattle were found dead in a shrubbery at Elmswell, near Driffield”\r\n(_Daily Mail_, 13th Dec., 1913). Many cases of poisoning and death of\r\nanimals due to eating the foliage direct from the trees have been\r\nrecorded in the veterinary journals—e.g. the death of 15 cattle in _The\r\nVeterinary News_, 7th Dec., 1912. Tegetmeier recorded the death of\r\npheasants due to Yew leaves and seeds (_The Field_, 11th Nov., 1893). On\r\nthe other hand many cases have been recorded in which fatal results have\r\nnot followed the ingestion of the leaves, and it appears that the lower\r\nbranches of Yew trees in parks are constantly cropped by cattle without\r\nill effects. (_Trans. Chem. Soc._, 1902; _Jour. Bd. Agric._, 1903).\r\n\r\nThe bark, leaves, and seeds are all poisonous, the leaves usually being\r\nthe parts eaten. Henslow states that of 32 cases of Yew poisoning 9 were\r\ndue to the berries and the remainder to the leaves, while 20 of the 32\r\ncases were fatal. In 1879 R. Modlen published a circumstantial account\r\nof children poisoned at Oxford by the fruits, and demonstrated that the\r\narillus or scarlet mucilaginous cup surrounding the ripe seed is not\r\npoisonous, but that the seeds are so. Apart from idiosyncrasy of\r\nappetite stock are perhaps more likely to eat the dark green foliage of\r\nthe Yew in winter or during scarcity of green fodder than at other\r\ntimes. The old leaves or shoots are the most poisonous parts.\r\n\r\nBy experiments with autumn and winter leaves Cornevin found that the\r\nfollowing quantities would be necessary to kill various animals:—\r\n\r\n            Horse         0·2  lb. per 100 lb. live weight.\r\n            Ass and Mule  0·16 lb.      „            „\r\n            Cow and Sheep 1·0  lb.      „            „\r\n            Goat          1·2  lb.      „            „\r\n            Pig           0·3  lb.      „            „\r\n            Rabbit        2·0  lb.      „            „\r\n\r\nOther authorities, however, quote much lower quantities as necessary to\r\nkill the horse and ox, and Pott says that in the case of horses 150 to\r\n180 grammes (0·33 to 0·4 lb.) is sufficient to cause death in\r\none-quarter to one-half an hour, without previous symptoms. Eaten by an\r\nanimal on a full stomach a small quantity of Yew may cause little or no\r\ndangerous results.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The researches of Marmé pointed to the alkaloid\r\n_Taxine_ (C_{37}H_{52}NO_{10}) as the toxic substance. Later\r\ninvestigations of Thorpe and Stubbs confirmed this view, and it is\r\ngenerally agreed that this substance is the toxic principle, though\r\ndoubts as to its being the only poison have been expressed. Taxine has a\r\nbitter taste, is a heart depressant, and may cause death from\r\nsuffocation. The yew also contains a considerable quantity of _Formic\r\nAcid_, and the acrid, irritant volatile _Oil of Yew_.\r\n\r\nThorpe and Stubbs (_Trans. Chem. Soc._, 1902) found in the fresh leaves\r\nof the common Yew from 0·1 to 0·18 per cent. of Taxine. In an\r\ninvestigation of the Irish Yew (_T. baccata_ var. _fastigiata_) Moss\r\nfound Taxine present as follows:—\r\n\r\n             Leaves from female tree, fresh 0·596 per cent.\r\n             Leaves from female tree, fresh 0·623     „\r\n             Seeds from fruit of same tree  0·079     „\r\n             Another female tree—leaves     0·323     „\r\n             Another female tree—seeds      0·082     „\r\n\r\nIn the leaves of the male common Yew Moss found 0·082 per cent. of\r\nTaxine, or less than one-half the quantity found by Thorpe and Stubbs.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The Yew is irritant and narcotic, and the poison is not\r\ncumulative, but on the other hand rapidly effective, so that animals may\r\ndie apparently suddenly, no previous symptoms having been observed.\r\n\r\nWhen small quantities only have been taken the closest attention is\r\nnecessary to discern the symptoms, which simply consist in a little\r\nexcitement with a slight rise in temperature.\r\n\r\nWith larger (but not fatal) quantities the first symptom, excitement, is\r\nmore pronounced and is followed by nausea, and (where possible)\r\nvomiting. There is a pronounced slackening of respiration and\r\ncirculation, the pulse being small, slow, and difficult to perceive, and\r\nthe movement of the flanks very slow; sensibility is diminished. There\r\nis a fall in temperature, the skin and extremities being cold. The head\r\nis lowered, the eyes are closed and there is decubitus. In some cases\r\npregnant animals have aborted. In the _horse_ there are muscular tremors\r\nand frequent urination. In _cattle_ and _sheep_ rumination is suspended\r\nand there is more or less pronounced tympanites, with eructation,\r\nnausea, and sometimes vomiting. _Pigs_ bury the head in the litter and\r\nsleep, their sleep being interrupted from time to time by nausea and\r\ngroaning; or the animals rise, stagger about, and lie down again.\r\n\r\nWith fatal quantities the foregoing symptoms may be followed by coma,\r\nwith death in two hours or more after the poisoning, but more generally\r\nand usually in horses, asses, and mules (but also in cattle) there is no\r\nperiod of coma, the excitement is less pronounced and often unobserved,\r\nand death appears very sudden. The animals stop, shake their heads,\r\nrespiration is modified, there is falling, and death (sometimes with\r\nconvulsions) results from cessation of the heart’s action (Cornevin).\r\n\r\nThe symptoms given by Müller are roaring, torpidity, stupefaction,\r\nlaboured breathing, convulsions and death in from ten minutes to an hour\r\nin the worst cases; or where the course of poisoning is slower, there is\r\nsalivation, nausea, vomiting, bloating, retardation of pulse and\r\nrespiration, great giddiness and stupefaction, diabetes and hæmaturia.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of the poisoning is confirmed by cases noted in the\r\nveterinary journals. Lander shows that the effects often only appear in\r\ncattle when chewing the cud; whilst quietly chewing, they drop as if\r\nshot. In some examples the animal died while eating the plant, or was\r\nfound to have fallen and died suddenly and without evidence of a\r\nstruggle. The animal in some cases will stop suddenly whilst working,\r\nstart blowing and trembling, stagger, fall on its haunches, then on its\r\nside, and die quietly. Death occurs in about five minutes with symptoms\r\nresembling apoplexy. A colt died after 16 or 17 hours; the plant was\r\ntaken on a full stomach, but paralysis of the alimentary system with\r\nstoppage of digestion immediately ensued.\r\n\r\nIn the case of pheasants there was acute inflammation of the small\r\nintestines (Tegetmeier).\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n          4, 16, 49, 73, 81, 84, 100, 128, 130, 141, 144, 161,\r\n                170, 189, 190, 205, 213, 239, 240, 256.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                AROIDEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Cuckoo Pint= (_Arum maculatum_ L.). The well-known Cuckoo Pint, or\r\nLords and Ladies, is to be regarded as highly poisonous, and children\r\nhave died from eating the berries. Animals have exceptionally eaten the\r\nplant, but no record of death has been found, as it does not appear to\r\nbe taken in sufficient quantity. Cornevin records that pigs have eaten\r\nthe roots, and suffered in consequence, though the results were not\r\nfatal. All parts of the plant are poisonous, though the virulence is\r\nlost on drying. The plant is acrid, and emits a disagreeable smell when\r\nbruised. In Gerarde’s _Herball_ the following passage occurs: “The most\r\npure and white starch is made from the rootes of the Cuckowpint; but\r\nmost hurtfull for the hands of the laundresse that hath the handling of\r\nit, for it choppeth, blistereth, and maketh the hands rough and rugged,\r\nand withall smarting.” In Dorset the tuber-like corms have been\r\nmacerated in water, dried and powdered, and eaten under the name\r\nPortland Sago or Portland Arrowroot, the poisonous property being\r\ndissipated.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The Cuckoo Pint does not seem to have received much\r\nattention in this connection, but the poisonous principle is believed to\r\nbe a _Saponin_.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The juice acts as an irritant when in contact with the\r\nmucous membrane. When a _pig_ has eaten several roots rich in sap, the\r\nmouth and tongue redden and tumefy, there is salivation, and swallowing\r\nis difficult on account of the inflammation at the back of the mouth.\r\nIntroduced in small quantity into the digestive tract it acts as an\r\nirritant and purgative, and sometimes causes vomiting. Severe intestinal\r\npains, excitement, some muscular contraction of the limbs, rocking of\r\nthe head, and superpurgation with tenesmus are also symptoms which have\r\nbeen observed. The intestinal pains continue for some days and the\r\nappetite is small. Cornevin states that animals never take a sufficient\r\nquantity to cause _fatal_ poisoning, but according to Lander, if a\r\ndangerous quantity is taken, convulsions, exhaustion, and death from\r\nshock may possibly follow the foregoing symptoms.\r\n\r\nA case in which a _horse_ was poisoned through a wound being washed with\r\na decoction of arum leaves is cited by Müller. There was much local\r\nswelling, trembling, and rapid breathing, and the heart beat strongly;\r\nthe animal died on the third day.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                      73, 81, 130, 141, 170, 190.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n                              DIOSCORIDEÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Black Bryony= (_Tamus communis_ L.). The stem and foliage of Black\r\nBryony are apparently harmless, being browsed by sheep and goats with\r\nimpunity, but the scarlet fruits are decidedly poisonous and the starchy\r\nroot is acrid and purgative.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ This is probably the glucoside _Bryonin_, which\r\noccurs in _Bryonia dioica_ (p. 35).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ Cornevin, in citing experiments on animals, states that\r\nsmall quantities of the fruits cause uneasiness, somnolence, and\r\ndifficult locomotion. Larger quantities cause vomiting, intestinal\r\npains, and paralysis of hind quarters. Death is rapid. Müller, however,\r\nremarks that paralysis of the hind quarters and convulsions may result\r\nfrom small quantities, large quantities causing in addition inflammation\r\nof the stomach and intestines.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                                73, 190.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LILIACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Herb Paris= (_Paris quadrifolia_ L.). Owing to its habitat—damp\r\nwoods—it is unlikely that stock will eat this plant, but it may be\r\npossible where fields border open woods in which it grows. No records of\r\nstock poisoning have been met with, but cases of poisoning in man are\r\nrecorded, one due to eating a considerable number (30 to 40) of the\r\nberries, and symptoms of poisoning in a child four years of age who had\r\neaten a few berries. In smaller quantities they are very poisonous to\r\npoultry. All parts are stated to be poisonous, especially the berries.\r\nFatal poisonings are nil, or very rare if recorded.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Walz isolated the glucoside _Paridin_; and Esser\r\nstates that the toxic property is due to a Saponin,—the bitter irritant\r\nglucoside _Paristyphnin_ (C_{38}H_{64}O_{18}), which is convertible into\r\nParidin (C_{16}H_{28}O_{7} + 2H_{2}O) and sugar.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The plant is emetic, purgative, intensely acrid, and\r\nnarcotic. Poisoning up to the present only appears to have been recorded\r\nin fowls, the symptoms being intense local inflammation, narcotic\r\neffects, vomiting, colic, diarrhœa, stupefaction, convulsions, and\r\nparalysis (Müller).\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                   4, 16, 73, 76, 81, 130, 141, 190.\r\n\r\n=Lily-of-the-Valley= (_Convallaria majalis_, L.). This beautiful plant\r\nis only likely to induce poisoning of domestic animals at very rare\r\nintervals, as it occurs wild in only a few woods from Moray southwards,\r\nbeing, however, abundant in some districts. All parts are stated to be\r\npoisonous, especially the flowers. It has an acrid, bitter taste. Few\r\ncases of poisoning are recorded. Sheep and goats are believed to eat the\r\nleaves with impunity. The extract is so poisonous that four drops\r\ninjected into the blood stream sufficed to kill a dog in ten minutes\r\n(Cornevin). The leaves have been known to kill geese and fowls.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ All parts of the plant contain the bitter poisonous\r\nglucoside _Convallamarin_ (C_{23}H_{44}O_{12}), the glucoside _Paridin_\r\n(C_{16}H_{28}O_{7} + 2H_{2}O), and the glucoside _Convallarin_\r\n(C_{34}H_{62}O_{11})—the first a dangerous purgative, and the last a\r\ncardiac poison resembling Digitalis. Convallamarin is a very poisonous\r\ncrystalline substance, with at first a bitter and afterwards a sweetish\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The action of this plant on the animal organism is not yet\r\nclearly known, but it is stated to have marked emetic and purgative\r\naction. Taken in moderate quantities a period of retardation of the\r\nheart and lung action is followed by a period in which the heart action\r\nis intermittent, and there are stoppages in respiration, and vomiting.\r\nTaken in large quantities, the first of these periods is extremely\r\nshort, the pulse soon becomes rapid and small, respiration is quickened,\r\nand the heart action ceases (Cornevin).\r\n\r\nPott observes that the leaves cause stupefaction, convulsions, and death\r\nafter a few hours in the case of _geese_. He cites a case in which ten\r\n_fowls_ ate the leaves and nine died.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                  52, 73, 76, 81, 190, 203, 205, 213.\r\n\r\n=Meadow Saffron= (_Colchicum autumnale_ L.). The Meadow Saffron, Autumn\r\nCrocus, or Naked Ladies, as it is variously named, occurs in meadows in\r\nmany districts in England and Wales. All parts are poisonous, both in\r\nthe green state and when dried, as it possibly may be, in hay. It has\r\ncaused extensive losses of live stock, and the greatest care should be\r\ntaken to eradicate it from grass land. The leaves and seed-vessels are\r\nproduced in spring, and the flowers from August to October—and it is at\r\nthese two periods that cases of poisoning by this plant are most\r\nfrequent, though, as stated, it may be included in hay. Many horses,\r\ncattle, and pigs have been killed by Meadow Saffron, though cattle\r\ncommonly avoid it. Sheep and goats are believed to be very slightly\r\naffected. Children and fowls died at Schorren (Canton Berne) from eating\r\nthe seeds, and there have been many cases of human poisoning due both to\r\neating the seeds and the bulbs. In Staffordshire, Mr J. C. Rushton\r\nreported some years ago[4] that in one year a farmer lost seventeen\r\nmilking cows; in 1908 he lost seven calves; and in 1909 he lost a number\r\nof sheep and cows. It was then discovered that the field in which the\r\nanimals grazed contained “any quantity of Meadow Saffron and Water\r\nHemlock,” and this was the cause of the losses. Horses and cattle are\r\nmore commonly poisoned than other domesticated animals. Johnson and\r\nSowerby record the case of a woman who ate the corms in mistake for\r\nonions at Covent Garden, and died; and state that deer and cattle have\r\nbeen killed by the leaves. Kanngiesser notes that this species is the\r\nmost toxic of German plants, and that in cases of human poisoning the\r\nmortality is 90 per cent., children being chiefly affected. Cornevin’s\r\nexperiments showed that 8 to 10 grammes of green leaves per kilogramme\r\nof live weight—say 3 to 5 lb. for an average cow—was sufficient to kill\r\nruminants; while 30 centigrammes of corms per kilogramme of live weight\r\nsufficed to kill pigs—say 4½ oz. for a pig of 200 lb. live weight.\r\nBarret and Remlinger (_Veterinary Journal_, 1912, p. 306) record the\r\nsudden illness of 31 out of 51 cattle, and 5 of them died.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  _Staffordshire Weekly Sentinel_, Aug. 21st, 1909.\r\n\r\nThe toxic principle is cumulative, that is, small quantities of the\r\nplant eaten regularly may result in poisoning, owing to the poison being\r\nslowly eliminated by the kidneys. Indeed, cases have been recorded in\r\nwhich the poison has been secreted and eliminated in the milk of cows\r\nand so has caused poisoning of both calves and infants.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Meadow Saffron contains in all parts the acrid,\r\npoisonous alkaloid _Colchicine_ (C_{22}H_{25}NO_{6}) stated by Esser to\r\noccur to the extent of 0·2 per cent. in the corms, 0·4 to 0·6 per cent.\r\nin the seed coats, but only traces in the leaves. Hertel obtained 0·38\r\nto 0·41 per cent. of alkaloid from the _seeds_, Farr and Wright from\r\n0·46 to 0·95 per cent., and Carr and Reynolds 0·12 to 0·57 per cent.;\r\nthe U.S. Pharmacopœia, 1905, required a Colchicine content of 0·45 per\r\ncent. in the _seeds_, and 0·35 per cent. in the _corms_ (Allen).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ After small, but not fatal doses there is loss of appetite,\r\nsuppression of rumination, salivation, light colic, diarrhœa and voiding\r\nof small quantities of urine. Blood has been observed in the milk of\r\naffected cows. Larger and fatal quantities cause total loss of appetite\r\nand sensation, stupefaction, loss of consciousness, dilatation of\r\npupils, unsteady gait, and even paralysis of limbs, sweating, severe\r\ncolic, and bloody diarrhœa, strangury and bloody urination; rapid,\r\nsmall, and finally imperceptible pulse, laboured breathing; and death in\r\nfrom one to three days. Where recovery takes place it is very slow (12\r\nto 14 days according to Cornevin).\r\n\r\nCornevin draws attention to the fact that, as the symptoms do not occur\r\nuntil several hours after ingestion, by which time the poison must be\r\npartly distributed, the poison is very dangerous and difficult to\r\ncombat, attempts at vomiting or evacuation, whether spontaneous or\r\ncaused therapeutically, having little chance of ridding the organism of\r\nthe poison. Cornevin’s account of the symptoms shows that at first there\r\nis abundant salivation, with constriction of the throat, and dysphagia;\r\nthen nausea with vomiting; colic; abundant, repeated and diarrhœic\r\nevacuations, which at the end become dysenteric with painful tenesmus;\r\nabundant urination; short, accelerated and difficult respiration, with\r\nincoordination in the thoracic and abdominal movements. The circulatory\r\nfunctions are modified only in fatal cases, when the pulse is small and\r\nintermittent towards the end. There is finally a notable drop in\r\ntemperature, shown by the coldness of the skin. Death occurs in from 16\r\nhours to 6 days after ingestion. During the last few hours the animals\r\nare stretched at full length and are incapable of getting up. There may\r\nbe prolapsus of the rectum; the eye is deeply sunk; sensibility is\r\ndeadened and death is due to stoppage of respiration.\r\n\r\nIn the _horse_, there are spasmodic movements of the hind-quarters and\r\nexcessive excitement of the urinary genital organs. In _cattle_ there is\r\ncessation of rumination, grinding of teeth, dryness of muzzle, ptyalism,\r\ngroaning, painful colic, dysentery, deeply sunken and watery eyes, anus\r\nwide open, and evacuation of very fœtid, blackish, glareous matter round\r\nthe excrement. In _cows_ there may be suppression of milk, and abortion.\r\nIn the _pig_ there is abundant salivation and vomiting, and the animal\r\nkeeps its snout buried in the litter. There is also extremely fœtid\r\ndiarrhœa, with dysentery.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n              4, 16, 27, 73, 81, 128, 130, 141, 148, 151,\r\n                        190, 192, 203, 217, 255.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               GRAMINEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Darnel= (_Lolium temulentum_ L.). The grass known as Darnel, of the\r\nsame genus as rye-grass, has been recognized for centuries as a harmful\r\nspecies, and it is considered by some authorities that it is really the\r\ntares of Scripture which the enemy sowed among the wheat. Its effect on\r\neyesight was known to the ancients[5], and its objectionable character\r\nwas noted by Shakespeare:—\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  E.g. Ovid says “Let the fields be clear of darnel that weakens the\r\n  eyes.” In Plautus’ comedy, _The Braggart Soldier_, one servant says to\r\n  another, “’Tis a wonder that you are in the habit of feeding on darnel\r\n  with wheat at so low a price.” “Why so?” “Because you are so dim of\r\n  sight.” [_Agric. Jour. Union of S. Africa_, Jan. 1914, p. 82.]\r\n\r\n                             “Want ye corn for bread?\r\n         I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast\r\n         Before he’ll buy again at such a rate:\r\n         ’Twas full of darnel: Do you like the taste?”\r\n                                 —I _Henry_ VI, Act III, Sc. 2.\r\n\r\nIts effect when mixed with flour was also referred to by Gerarde (1597):\r\n“The new bread wherein Darnell is, eaten hot, causeth drunkenness; in\r\nlike manner doth beere or ale wherein the seede is fallen, or put into\r\nthe mault.”\r\n\r\nBefore the seeding stage is reached Darnel seems to be quite suitable as\r\na food for stock, only the seed or grain being poisonous, and this not\r\ninvariably so. The chief danger perhaps is that the grain may not be\r\nthoroughly removed from cereal grains, and may thus find its way into\r\nbread or cereal stock foods. Though it has caused many cases of human\r\npoisoning, fatal results seem to be rare: Dr. Taylor could record no\r\nfatal case up to 1859. Darnel mixed with barley caused the poisoning of\r\npigs (_Veterinarian_, 1842). Johnson and Sowerby (1861) state that\r\nDarnel has in several cases proved fatal to horses and sheep. The same\r\nauthorities quote a case in which 80 inmates of Sheffield Workhouse were\r\nattacked by violent vomiting and purging from the use of oatmeal\r\ncontaining Darnel. At the Veterinary School at Lyons a horse was killed\r\nby giving it 2 kilogrammes (4·4 lb.) of Darnel. Cornevin concluded that\r\nthe amounts of Darnel necessary to kill certain animals would be as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n           Horse     0·7 lb. per 100 lb. live weight.\r\n           Ruminants 1·5 to 1·8 lb.  per 100 lb. live weight.\r\n           Poultry   1·5 to 1·8 lb.       „           „\r\n           Dog       1·8 lb.              „           „\r\n\r\nHe found pigs very little affected. As regards man 30 grammes (1 oz.) of\r\nthe flour appear to be about the most that can be taken without showing\r\ndangerous symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe presence of Darnel flour in flour of the cereal grains may be\r\ndetermined by an examination of the starch granules, which are given by\r\nCornevin as only 5 to 8µ; in diameter (compared with 25 to 4µ for rye),\r\nsimple in general, but sometimes in groups of 2 to even 5, polyhedral or\r\npartly rounded, with a nucleus or fusiform nucleal cavity, and readily\r\ncoloured blue with iodine; they resemble those of maize but are only\r\nabout one-eighth the size.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ The grains only are harmful, and contain the narcotic\r\nalkaloid _Temuline_ (C_{7}H_{12}N_{2}O), which Hofmeister showed to be a\r\nstrong nerve poison, and which is said to occur to the extent of 0·08\r\nper cent. in the seeds. Other authorities impute the toxic property to\r\n_Loliine_, while Smith states that the toxic principle is _Picrotoxin_.\r\nIn relation to the grain fungal hyphæ have usually been found, though\r\nnot invariably, 20 to 30 per cent. of the plants sometimes being free\r\nfrom it. The fungus (_Endoconidium temulentum_) is propagated\r\nvegetatively by means of mycelium. It appears to live symbiotically in\r\nthe maturing grain, and perhaps to a slight extent renders possible the\r\nassimilation of nitrogen from the atmosphere; but Freeman observed that\r\nthough generally stimulating to the Darnel, it is occasionally injurious\r\nto it. Esser sums it up by saying that according to most authorities who\r\nhave investigated Darnel the fungus alone contains the toxic\r\nsubstance—the Temuline—and hence the grains in which the fungus does not\r\noccur should be harmless. The fungus is found in Darnel grain in all\r\ncountries—Chile, Brazil, S. Africa, Persia, Spain, France, Sweden,\r\nGermany, etc. So far as can be ascertained there have been no feeding\r\nexperiments to determine the difference in toxic character between\r\nfungus-infested and fungus-free grains. The dangerous properties are\r\nsaid to be most pronounced in wet seasons.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ In France Darnel is called _Ivraie_, because, when brewed\r\nwith barley, it acts as a narcotic intoxicant.\r\n\r\nDarnel poisoning induces giddiness, drowsiness, uncertain gait, and\r\nstupefaction (Müller), and, in the older animals, vomiting, convulsions,\r\nloss of sensation and death (Pott).\r\n\r\nThe symptoms in the _horse_ are dilatation of pupils, vertigo, uncertain\r\ngait, and trembling. The animal falls, the body is cold and the\r\nextremities are stiff, respiration is laboured, the pulse is slow and\r\nsmall, and there are convulsive movements of the head and limbs. There\r\nis rapid enfeeblement, and death may occur within thirty hours.\r\n\r\nIn _pigs_, foaming, convulsions and paralysis have been observed; the\r\nstomach and intestines were inflamed and the lungs congested.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n           4, 16, 73, 81, 106, 128, 130, 141, 190, 203, 204,\r\n                        205, 213, 233, 235, 254.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EQUISETACEÆ.\r\n\r\n=Horsetails= (_Equisetum_ sp.). A very great deal has been written on\r\nthe subject of Equisetosis or _Equisetum_ poisoning, and even at the\r\npresent day opinion is divided as to which species are poisonous and to\r\nwhat extent. From the time of Linnæus there has been uncertainty as to\r\nthe species, which has generally been given as _E. arvense_. Two German\r\npapers, by Weber and Lohmann respectively, published by the German\r\nAgricultural Society in 1903 and 1904, have done much to remove doubt on\r\nthe matter, but cannot be said to have settled the question absolutely.\r\nThese two papers seem to have been overlooked by some recent writers on\r\nthe subject, but Lohmann’s appears to be the most authoritative paper\r\nyet written. Both are referred to below.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be definitely proved that certain species of _Equisetum_\r\nreally are poisonous, hesitating statements notwithstanding. Chesnut and\r\nWilcox state that there are cases of poisoning of both horses and sheep\r\nby _E. arvense_ in the United States, though they are not common, and\r\nthe opinion is expressed that “the plant, if deleterious, is evidently\r\nso only on account of its harsh scouring action in the mouth and\r\nintestinal tract.” On the other hand Rich and Jones record poisoning of\r\nhorses by _E. arvense_ in hay, but while adding that horses seem to\r\ndevelop a depraved appetite for the weed, they state that they have no\r\nevidence that horses grazing upon _the green plant_ are poisoned.\r\nGüssow’s experience has been that cattle do not suffer any inconvenience\r\nat all from this species, or only very slight disturbance of the\r\ndigestive organs, but that horses are conspicuously subject to fatal\r\npoisoning by it. Examination of hay on which a considerable number of\r\npoisoned horses were fed revealed in every case the presence of _E.\r\narvense_. When the food was changed, horses, if not too seriously\r\naffected, made rapid recovery. (Treatment suggested is to change to\r\neasily digested food, give a sharp purgative, and follow by small doses\r\nof nux vomica three times a day.) Pammel says that in recent years a\r\ndisease of horses in Vermont has been attributed to hay and fodder\r\ncontaining the weed; that it is proved by experiment that when ingested\r\nin sufficient quantity _E. arvense_ is capable of causing fatal\r\npoisoning in horses, and is at times the cause of extensive losses; and\r\nthat young horses are most susceptible, while grain-fed horses are less\r\nsusceptible than others. He adds that sheep are supposed to be slightly\r\naffected, but cattle eat hay in which it occurs in large proportion with\r\nimpunity.\r\n\r\nComing to the two German reports, it is stated by Weber (1903) that _E.\r\npalustre_ contains a specific poison for cattle and other ruminants, but\r\nsheep and goats are able, owing to their fine muzzles, to separate it in\r\nfodder, and hence suffer less. Horses and pigs, he says, seem to suffer\r\nvery little. Young animals and stock, from districts where the species\r\ndoes not occur, suffer more than those from places where it occurs—the\r\nlatter appearing to learn early to avoid it.\r\n\r\nLohmann conducted feeding experiments with guinea-pigs with _E.\r\narvense_, _E. palustre_, _E. pratense_, _E. sylvaticum_, _E. maximum_,\r\nand _E. heleocharis_ (not British). He also fed _E. arvense_ and _E.\r\npalustre_ to horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, and geese in considerable\r\nquantities for many days on end; and made experiments with aconitic acid\r\non guinea-pigs and horses. The feeding experiments with guinea-pigs\r\nshowed that of the species named only _E. palustre_ and to a less extent\r\n_E. sylvaticum_ are poisonous plants (to guinea-pigs). With the large\r\ndomestic animals the experiments showed _E. arvense_ to be a harmless\r\nplant, and _E. palustre_ to be really injurious to cattle but avoided by\r\nother stock. Lohmann considers that the many statements in the\r\nliterature agree in part with this result, and that the divergent\r\nobservations may be traced to various causes, among which perhaps an\r\nabnormal chemical composition of the weed fed plays a principal part.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, however, the American results must be carefully\r\nborne in mind, and _E. arvense_ must not too hastily be regarded as\r\nblameless.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ It was for some years believed that the apparent\r\ntoxic symptoms induced by Horsetails were due to Silica or to Aconitic\r\nacid—the latter a substance found by Matz and Ludwig. The conclusion\r\ncome to by Weber, however, was that the poisoning by _E. palustre_ is of\r\nan organic character, not due to silica. The young shoots, which contain\r\nlittle silica, were found in general to be much more poisonous than the\r\nold plants, which contain much silica. It was long since found by\r\nWiggers that dried plants of _E. palustre_ contained 8·88 per cent. of\r\nsilica, but all species contain this substance in greater or less\r\ndegree, and it varies considerably in amount, even in the same species.\r\nThe feeding experiments conducted by Lohmann, with certain species of\r\n_Equisetum_, and the observed symptoms of illness after the consumption\r\nof some of them, particularly _E. palustre_, serve to show that the ill\r\neffects are neither to be attributed to greater or less digestibility,\r\nnor to the silica present. Neither are the aconitic acid and other\r\norganic substances, in part found in previous investigations,\r\nresponsible for the poisoning. However, an active compound named\r\n_Equisetine_, a substance belonging to the alkaloid group, was isolated;\r\nthis occurs usually, perhaps only, in _E. palustre_, at any rate in\r\nsufficient quantity to be dangerous to animals. Lohmann then, following\r\nup the investigations of Paucerzynski, Matz, Meyer, Weber and others,\r\nascertained definitely that _E. palustre_ contains an alkaloidal nerve\r\npoison, to which the name _Equisetine_ was given, and the experiments\r\nwere held to decide that this is the poisonous substance in this\r\nspecies. (As stated above, _E. arvense_ was held to be harmless.)\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ At first, excitement and anxiety, followed by uncertainty of\r\nmovement, reeling and staggering; paralysis of hind limbs at least,\r\nfalling, possibly general paralysis, insensibility to external\r\nirritants, unconsciousness, and coma. Pulse accelerated, appetite at\r\nfirst normal, but in course of time great disturbance of nutrition;\r\nsugar in the urine. Course sometimes very acute, death occurring in a\r\nfew hours, but sometimes protracted (two to eight days), and at times\r\neven chronic (one to several weeks).\r\n\r\nIn _cattle_, after excessive eating, continuous diarrhœa is\r\ncharacteristic, with paralysis; while, if the food be persisted with,\r\ncachexia and hydræmia combined with weakness bordering on paralysis make\r\ntheir appearance (Friedberger and Fröhner, _via_ Pammel). In addition to\r\ncachexia, Pott also mentions colic, stoppage, bloody urination,\r\nabortion, and loss of teeth.\r\n\r\nYoung animals appear to succumb sooner than older ones, while grain-fed\r\nanimals are more resistant than others. Referring to _E. arvense_ Pammel\r\nsays it produces paralysis of the rear extremities, and when death\r\noccurs spasms are noted. In relation to the poisoning of _horses_ by the\r\nsame species in hay Rich and Jones note unthriftiness, the animal\r\nappearing thin and the muscles wasted. In from two to five weeks,\r\naccording to the age of the horse and the manner of feeding, the animal\r\nbegins to lose control of the muscles, and there is swaying and\r\nstaggering, though the eye is bright and the appetite good. If the plant\r\nis regularly ingested the horse loses the power of standing, becomes\r\nnervous, struggles to rise, the legs become more or less rigid, and at\r\ntimes all the muscles of the body seem convulsed. Even in this condition\r\none well-nursed patient lived two weeks. The horses are generally\r\nwilling to eat, although unable to rise, but become sore and tired from\r\nstruggling, finally dying from exhaustion. Life is much prolonged by\r\nturning from side to side three or four times in twenty-four hours, thus\r\npreventing congestion. The pulse is slow till near the end, when it is\r\nrapid and weak; the temperature is below normal at first, but when the\r\nanimal is down there is fever; the extremities are usually cold; and the\r\nlining membrane of the mouth, nose, and eye becomes pale.\r\n\r\nOf _Equisetum_ sp. Stebler and Schroeter say that they induce diarrhœa\r\nin cattle, which become poor, and in cows the milk yield is checked or\r\nceases. Weber also refers to the effect on milk yield of _E. palustre_,\r\nwhich he says causes the milk of affected cows to become watery, poor in\r\nfat, and gives rise to a greasy, unappetising butter, while the yield\r\nmay soon quite fail.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n   2, 20, 57, 111, 176, 203, 204, 213, 220, 221, 222, 237, 260, 261.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                FILICES.\r\n\r\n=Bracken= (_Pteris aquilina_ L.). The Bracken, Brake Fern, or “Fern” is\r\nof very considerable importance to farmers for four reasons: (1) It is a\r\nmost pernicious weed; (2) it forms an excellent litter for stock and\r\ntreads down into good manure; (3) it is said to have been successfully\r\nconverted into silage; but (4) it has been accused of poisoning cattle.\r\n\r\nIn regard to possible poisonous properties, it must be said that the\r\nfacts are at present somewhat uncertain, but a number of authorities\r\nclearly regard the Bracken as poisonous. (_a_) Müller (1897) records the\r\npoisoning of horses which ate it for some weeks with chaff—and some\r\ndied. (_b_) Chesnut and Wilcox (1901) say that cases of poisoning of\r\nhorses and cattle have been reported from England and a few localities\r\nin the United States. (_c_) Pott states that when eaten in quantity by\r\ncattle Bracken causes hæmaturia, and in horses nervous symptoms (brain\r\ntrouble), sometimes with fatal effects. (_d_) Pammel also remarks on the\r\nbelieved poisonous character of this plant. (_e_) In view of its\r\nsuspected poisonous character feeding experiments were conducted by the\r\nBoard of Agriculture and Fisheries with a large quantity of Bracken, but\r\nthe results were negative, yielding no experimental proof of the plant\r\nbeing poisonous. One animal—a heifer—consumed 60 lb. of Bracken between\r\nAug. 14 and Aug. 20, and after two meals containing about 30 lb. of\r\nBracken showed only symptoms of indigestion. After the 60 lb. there were\r\nno symptoms of illness. It has been thought possible that the so-called\r\nBracken poisoning is due to _Potentilla Tormentilla_ (_q.v._).\r\n\r\nIn 1893 Storrar dealt with the question and expressed the view that any\r\ndisorder due to Bracken was probably not a toxic effect but a digestive\r\ntrouble simply (_Jour. Comp. Path._, 1893).\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Continental authorities say that Bracken contains the\r\npoisonous _Pteritannic acid_, which is identical with the _Filicic acid_\r\nof the Male Fern (_Aspidium filix-mas_).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ In the cases of horses which died Müller gives the symptoms\r\nas timidity, slower movement or action, loss of balance, dilated pupils,\r\nreddening followed by yellowing of the conjunctivæ, and slowing of the\r\npulse.\r\n\r\nPammel notes Bracken as an astringent and anthelmintic, and also says it\r\ncauses enteritis, spasms, and paralysis.\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n                    10, 25, 57, 190, 203, 204, 213.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FUNGI[6].\r\n\r\n=Ergot= (_Claviceps purpurea_). This fungus, parasitic on rye and a\r\nnumber of grasses, has long been known to induce distinct poisonous\r\neffects on man and domestic animals when ingested in sufficient\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Poisonous parasitic fungi generally are not dealt with in this volume,\r\n  but ergot is included because it is widely distributed and perhaps the\r\n  best known, while its effects have been fully studied.\r\n\r\nErgot must be regarded as a cause of abortion in cows, though somewhat\r\ndivergent views have been expressed as to the facts, some authorities\r\nconsidering the belief well founded, while others consider that there is\r\nlittle ground for it. It is quite clear, however, that when taken in\r\nsufficient quantity Ergot induces serious poisoning of domestic animals.\r\nHorses have died in two or three days from eating ergoted hay and wild\r\nrye. Extensive outbreaks of ergotism have occurred in the United States,\r\nand serious losses have been recorded in the Central and Western States.\r\nEwart remarks that “a comparatively small number of fresh Ergot grains\r\nsuffice to injure or kill a horse, cow, or sheep.” The effects of the\r\npoisoning of animals will be found under _Symptoms_ below.\r\n\r\n_Toxic Principle._ Ergot of rye is used in medicine. It contains 0·20 to\r\n0·25 per cent. of _Ergotinine_. In the British Pharmaceutical Codex,\r\n1911, the grains (sclerotia) of Ergot (see Frontispiece) are described\r\nas longitudinally furrowed, 1 to 4 cm. long, slender, curved, tapering\r\nto both ends; they break with a short fracture, and are somewhat\r\ntriangular in transverse section; they have a characteristic and\r\ndisagreeable odour and taste, are dark violet to black in colour, and\r\nwhitish within. Ergot contains the physiologically active alkaloid\r\n_Ergotoxine_ or _Hydroergotinine_ (C_{35}H_{41}O_{6}N_{5}), also known\r\nas _amorphous Ergotinine_, and, when formerly obtained in an impure\r\nstate, as _Cornutine_ and _Ecboline_. It is the hydrate of the\r\ncrystalline base Ergotinine (C_{35}H_{39}O_{5}N_{5}). There are also\r\nother physiologically active constituents derived from amino-acids.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ In man Ergot has induced two types of epidemic ergotism,\r\ncaused by the prolonged use of ergoted rye bread. The two forms are\r\nrarely or never found together. One is a gangrenous form characterized\r\nby agonizing pain in the extremities, followed by dry gangrene of the\r\nperipheral parts of the body. The second type of ergotism is much more\r\nrare—a nervous epidemic characterized by paroxysmal epileptiform\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that at the outset ergotism causes irritation in the\r\nhands and feet it is termed “Kribbelkrankheit” in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe three substances noted above as isolated by Kobert are stated to\r\ncause poisoning—the first producing inflammation of the serous and\r\nmucous membranes, disintegration of the red blood cells, and widespread\r\necchymoses; the second excites the central nervous system and causes\r\ngeneral convulsions; and the last induces gangrene.\r\n\r\nIn one case a horse ate ergoted hay: next day the left hind leg was\r\nstiff, and moist with cold sweat; on the second day it was badly swollen\r\nand gangrene of all the tissues became apparent, and after the skin of\r\nthe leg and a considerable part of the muscular tissue had sloughed off\r\nthe animal died on the third day. In other cases horses showed symptoms\r\ntwenty-four hours after eating ergoted hay: fatigue, indisposition to\r\nwork, cold sweat, particularly on the neck, paralysis of the tongue and\r\nmuscles concerned in swallowing, and then generalized paralysis, very\r\nslow and deep respiration, subnormal temperature, normal pulse at first\r\nand then weaker till scarcely distinguishable, death in six or eight\r\nhours (Chesnut and Wilcox).\r\n\r\nAccording to Pammel ergotism manifests itself among animals chiefly in\r\nthe chronic form, the poison being acquired in small amounts and\r\naccumulation taking place slowly. Two distinct forms of the disease are\r\nrecognized, the spasmodic and gangrenous. “Symptoms referable to the\r\ndigestive tract, such as nausea, vomiting, colic, diarrhœa, or\r\nconstipation occur in both forms. Pregnant animals very frequently\r\nabort.”\r\n\r\n“In the spasmodic type of the disease, symptoms due to overstimulation\r\nof the central nervous system appear. These are tonic contraction of the\r\nflexor tendons of the limbs, anæsthesia of the extremities, muscular\r\ntrembling, general tetanic spasms, convulsions and delirium. Death\r\nusually occurs from secondary causes.”\r\n\r\n“Gangrenous ergotism is characterised by coldness and anæsthesia of the\r\nextremities, followed ultimately by dry gangrene of these parts. The\r\neffects of this dry gangrene are often very serious and amount to\r\nsloughing of the feet, tips of the ears, tip of the tail, shedding of\r\nthe hair, teeth, etc. Death takes place from exhaustion.\r\n\r\n“Acute poisoning is characterized by vomiting (in dogs), profuse\r\nsalivation, dilatation of the pupils, rapid breathing and frequent\r\npulse. The animal cries out, has convulsive twitchings, staggering gait,\r\nparaplegia, intense thirst and coma, terminating in death.”\r\n\r\nIn an extensive outbreak of ergotism in the United States in 1884 Law\r\nand Salmon reported as a prominent symptom ulceration of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the tongue and mouth cavity, this and lesions on the\r\nextremities giving the appearance of foot-and-mouth disease. Affected\r\nanimals showed weakness, dullness, and paralytic conditions of certain\r\ngroups of muscles. When in pregnant animals the uterus is acted upon,\r\nlabour pains occur, and the fœtus is expelled. The straining in those\r\ncases is often very painful and may be so severe that prolapsus of the\r\nuterus or even the rectum is the result. When Ergot produces gangrene,\r\nit usually affects the extremities, like the lower parts of the legs,\r\nthe ears, tail or teats in cattle, and the comb, wattles, toes, wings or\r\ntongue of poultry. It is preceded by redness, coldness, and painful\r\nswelling of the parts affected. After a while sensibility of the dying\r\nregion is lost and the line of demarcation between it and the living\r\ntissue becomes manifest. The dead portion commonly dies and is cast off.\r\nIn some cases the gangrene is accompanied by symptoms of a septic\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n“The possible result of the poisoning depends largely on the amount of\r\nErgot taken and on the severity of the symptoms produced thereby. When\r\nsmall amounts are taken and only a slight dullness or digestive\r\ndisturbance results the outlook may be quite favourable. Even Ergot\r\nabortion with rather severe symptoms usually is followed by recovery,\r\nbut in the gangrenous cases, fatal terminations are common. The animals\r\nwhich through this cause have lost one or more parts are not only\r\ncrippled, but septic or embolic complications may lead to a fatal\r\ntermination. Paralytic cases do not permit of a favourable prognosis,\r\nespecially if muscle groups containing important functions are\r\ninvolved.” (_N. Dakota Exp. Sta. Rept._)\r\n\r\n                              REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n      1, 4, 13, 16, 35, 57, 81, 82, 128, 154, 161, 203, 242, 251.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n                  PLANTS SUSPECTED OF BEING POISONOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very large number of plants have at various times been suspected of\r\npossessing poisonous properties and causing harm to live stock. Of these\r\nit is quite probable that many are in practice entirely harmless, but\r\nsome must be included as possibly deleterious, complaints having been\r\nmade which vary in gravity from a slight irritation to causing death.\r\n\r\n=Purging Flax= (_Linum catharticum_ L.). It is perhaps doubtful whether\r\nthis plant is really poisonous unless taken in considerable quantity by\r\nanimals—as it is quite unlikely to be. It may, however, be included\r\nhere, as it is stated to contain a glucoside which is purgative and\r\nwhich on fermentation yields prussic acid.\r\n\r\n=Furze= or =Gorse= (_Ulex europæus_ L.). In view of the fact that\r\nGerrard isolated from the seeds of Gorse the alkaloid _Ulexine_, which\r\nis identical with _Cytisine_ (p. 27) and that the alkaloid is also\r\ncontained in less quantity in the bark of young shoots, this plant has\r\nbeen suspected of possessing toxic properties. Experiments (179)[7] with\r\nthe alkaloid definitely showed it to be a nerve and muscle poison, 3\r\nmilligrammes having killed a chloroformed cat with convulsions in three\r\nminutes, though the animal could be kept alive as long as artificial\r\nrespiration was kept up. As, however, Gorse has long been used very\r\nwidely and in considerable quantities as a fodder the percentage content\r\nof the alkaloid must in general be exceedingly small, and no harmful\r\neffects need be feared from the consumption of the cut and bruised\r\nplant. Possibly the seeds might prove injurious if eaten in quantity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  Reference to Bibliography.\r\n\r\n=Melilot= (_Melilotus_ sp.) may at times cause injury. Ewart (82)\r\nwrites: “All the species contain Cumarin, a volatile odoriferous\r\nprinciple, which in excess produces a disinclination to locomotion,\r\nparalysis and ultimately fatal symptoms. No harm is to be apprehended if\r\nthe amount present does not exceed 10 per cent. of the herbage.”\r\n\r\n=Silver Weed= (_Potentilla Anserina_ L.). This well-known and elegant\r\nlittle weed is scarcely likely to be eaten to any extent by farm stock,\r\nthough it may possibly be taken occasionally on roadsides. It has not\r\nbeen proved to be poisonous, but Pott states that it has a strongly\r\nconstipating effect (213).\r\n\r\n=Tormentil= (_Potentilla Tormentilla_ L.). In relation to supposed\r\nbracken poisoning (see p. 87) in regard to which experiments were\r\nconducted by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, Tormentil occurred\r\nin several instances with the bracken in localities where this plant was\r\nreported to cause poisoning. Two feeding experiments in which the weed\r\nwas fed to heifers gave negative results. In a further case, however, 4\r\nor 5 lb. were collected from a field where sick animals were grazing,\r\nand fed to a heifer; it appeared to be the cause of rise of temperature\r\n(to 106° F.), diarrhœa, and the passing of a considerable quantity of\r\nblood in the fæces for three days, after which the animal improved. It\r\nwas, however, slaughtered, and lesions were found similar to those found\r\nin animals dying in the field from so-called bracken poisoning. Though\r\nthe plant was suspected, results generally were not held to prove that\r\nit was the cause of poisoning (25). According to Van Rijn the root of\r\nTormentil contains a considerable quantity of _Chinovic acid_\r\n(C_{32}H_{48}O_{6}?).\r\n\r\n=Wall-Pepper= (_Sedum acre_ L.) is regarded as emetic and purgative, but\r\nto lose the harmful properties on drying.\r\n\r\n=Sundews= (_Drosera_ sp.) are reputed to be poisonous to sheep, but no\r\nevidence has been found.\r\n\r\n=White-Rot= or =Marsh Penny-Wort= (_Hydrocotyle vulgaris_ L.) is stated\r\nto have caused inflammation of the digestive tract, and hæmaturia; and\r\nto contain a toxic substance _Vellarin_ (213).\r\n\r\n=Wild Parsnip= (_Pastinaca sativa_ L.). This plant has often been\r\nsupposed to be poisonous, but Pammel shows that in Iowa the plant is\r\nquite harmless, as it appears to be in Britain.\r\n\r\n=Devil’s-Bit= (_Scabiosa succisa_ L.) is stated by Moir to have caused\r\ninjury to cattle in one instance (_Vet. Record_, 1899), causing\r\nsalivation, gritting of the teeth, twitching of facial muscles, and\r\nslightly protruded, abraded, swollen and sensitive tongue. An experiment\r\non cattle showed the plant to induce violent inflammation of the mouth\r\nand tongue.\r\n\r\n=All-Heal= (_Valeriana officinalis_ L.) is not likely to be eaten by\r\nstock in sufficient quantity to cause poisonous symptoms, though it is\r\nstated to contain the poisonous _Valerianic acid_ and _Oil of Valerian_.\r\nAccording to Chevalier (_vide_ Henry) this plant contains an alkaloid\r\nnot yet fully characterised.\r\n\r\n=Canadian Erigeron= (_Erigeron canadensis_ L.), sporadic in England, is\r\nsuspected in America. It contains an oil, chiefly a _terpene_\r\n(C_{10}H_{16}). It has an acrid taste, causes smarting of the eyes,\r\nsoreness of throat, aching of extremities, and colic; and irritation to\r\npeople handling it (203).\r\n\r\n=Mayweeds= (_Anthemis_ sp.). It is not at all clear whether these plants\r\nare more than irritant in character, and they are so very common and\r\nwidely distributed that there would probably be more evidence if they\r\nwere poisonous. _A. Cotula_ is regarded as suspected by Smith and\r\nHalsted, while Ewart says that it is obnoxious to stock on account of\r\nits unpleasant flavour, and if eaten by them in time of scarcity is apt\r\nto give their flesh, milk, or butter an unpleasant flavour. Güssow\r\nstates that this species blisters the mouth and nostrils of animals. In\r\nhis investigations at Kew, Greshoff found that the seeds of _A. Cotula_\r\nand _A. arvensis_ contain much hydrocyanic acid. (He further found that\r\nthe cyanogenetic glucoside from _A. aetnensis_ Schouw. and _A. chia_ L.\r\nbelongs to the amygdalin type, giving off hydrocyanic acid and\r\nbenzaldehyde on hydrolysis. “The strong odour of benzaldehyde may even\r\nbe observed on grinding the seeds with water. Species of _Anthemis_\r\ncontained from 0·15 down to 0·03 per cent. of hydrocyanic acid.”)\r\n\r\n=Cat’s-Ear= (_Hypochæris radicata_ L.). No record of poisoning of Cat’s\r\nEar has been found, but it may be mentioned here, since Ewart says of\r\nit: “It contains a bitter, milky sap, which makes it unpalatable though\r\nnot entirely poisonous.... An exclusive diet of this weed could not help\r\nbut injure stock eventually.”\r\n\r\n=Dodders= (_Cuscuta_ sp.), when parasitic on clovers and fed as fodder\r\nor hay, have been suspected of causing digestive troubles in horses and\r\ncattle in the United States. Müller records a case of poisoning of young\r\npigs by _C. europæa_, with inflammation of the intestines and nervous\r\nsymptoms. Barbey determined the presence of the glucoside _Cuscutin_ in\r\n_C. Epithymum_.\r\n\r\n=Viper’s Bugloss= (_Echium vulgare_ L.) is suspected of being poisonous;\r\naccording to Friedberger and Fröhner it causes slavering (see also\r\n_Cynoglossum_).\r\n\r\n=Hound’s Tongue= (_Cynoglossum officinale_ L.). To what extent this\r\nplant is actually poisonous is not clear, but with some other members of\r\nthe order (_Echium vulgare_, _Anchusa officinalis_), it contains the two\r\nalkaloids _Consolidine_ and _Cynoglossine_—the former of which paralyses\r\nthe central nervous system and the latter the peripheral nerves.\r\n(Greimer, 1900: _vide_ Henry).\r\n\r\nAccording to Hooker, Hound’s Tongue is narcotic and astringent, and\r\nSmith includes it as a simple vegetable irritant, causing nausea and\r\npurging. No records of actual poisoning of animals have been found.\r\n\r\n=Broom-rape= (_Orobanche minor_ Sutt.) has been suspected, and according\r\nto Boitel is liable to cause violent colic when it occurs in\r\nconsiderable proportion in clover and is ingested with it (73). On the\r\nother hand, in a case noted by Stapledon, in which Broom-rape (_O.\r\nminor_) had completely overrun the aftermath on a farm near Fishguard,\r\ntwo-year-old cattle devoured the plant with apparent relish and cleared\r\noff most of it in a few days after being turned in. The farmer stated\r\nthat he saw no trace of colic or other ill effects. (_Jour. Bd. Agric._,\r\nSeptember, 1916.)\r\n\r\n=Great Mullein= (_Verbascum Thapsus_ L.). Though it does not appear to\r\nbe touched by farm live-stock the Great Mullein must be mentioned here.\r\nThe leaves and flowers have been used medicinally as an emollient and\r\npectoral, while the seeds possess narcotic properties and serve to\r\nstupefy fish (73). Pammel states that the plant causes irritation, but\r\nis probably not very poisonous to stock.\r\n\r\n=Toadflax= (_Linaria vulgaris_ Mill.). Cornevin describes Toadflax as\r\nacrid and poisonous, but says that stock reject it, and he could record\r\nno accidents to animals. In his full and excellent account of this weed,\r\nKraus says it is regarded as poisonous, or suspected of being so, but\r\nthat according to most accounts it is not harmful to cattle (168).\r\nLeunis regards it as suspicious on account of its acridity. Some German\r\nauthorities say it is willingly eaten by cattle, but it is generally\r\nbelieved to be avoided, and owing to its disagreeable odour and acrid\r\ntaste this view is probably correct. The plant has not been exhaustively\r\nstudied, and while Smith gives the toxic principle as _Oil of\r\nSnapdragon_ and the resin _Gratiolin_, it may be observed that Toadflax\r\ncontains the glucoside _Linarin_ (C_{64}H_{56}O_{40}).\r\n\r\n=Figworts= (_Scrophularia nodosa_ L. and _S. aquatica_ L.). These plants\r\nare not likely to be eaten by animals, but Cornevin states that the\r\nformer is strongly emetic and purgative, and that in excess it may cause\r\nsuperpurgation ending in death. Müller says that the two species have\r\nrespectively caused poisonous symptoms in a cow and a sheep; in the case\r\nof the cow there were loss of appetite and symptoms of paralysis. From\r\n_S. nodosa_ Walz extracted a bitter, crystalline substance,\r\n_Scrophularine_.\r\n\r\n=Yellow Rattle= (_Rhinanthus Crista-galli_ L.). When grass land is put\r\nunder the plough Yellow Rattle present may re-appear in a cereal crop as\r\na semi-parasite, and its seeds may later be ground up with the grain,\r\nimparting a reddish or violet-brown colour and an unpleasant taste to\r\nthe flour and even bread made from it. It is strongly suspected of being\r\npoisonous, like _Pedicularis_ and _Melampyrum_, but it is by no means\r\nclear how far it may prove harmful to stock. It is believed by some\r\npeople to impart a bad taste to the butter made from the milk of cows\r\ngrazing on infested pastures. Lehmann ate without harm 35 grammes (about\r\n1¼ oz.) of the seeds made into a cake and cooked; and during four days\r\nhe gave a rabbit 1238 grammes (2·7 lb.) of the fresh plant with\r\nhalf-ripe seeds, without apparent injury (73).\r\n\r\nIn some poor pastures it occurs in excessive quantity, and would appear\r\nto be only very slightly poisonous, or would have attracted wider\r\nattention. It is possibly only poisonous after being eaten for a\r\nprolonged period, as in the case of _Lolium temulentum_, and _Lathyrus\r\nsativus_. The seeds contain the bitter-sweet glucoside _Rhinanthin_\r\n(C_{29}H_{52}O_{20}), which is suspected of having poisonous properties.\r\n\r\n=Cow-Wheat= (_Melampyrum arvense_ L.). It seems clear that Cow-Wheat is\r\nat least not poisonous unless eaten in very considerable\r\nquantities—amounts in fact which in practice are most unlikely to be\r\neaten. The seeds may occur in cereal grains, and hence be ground up into\r\nmeal. As they are said to contain a glucoside analogous to _Rhinanthin_,\r\nhave a bitter taste and peculiar odour, and impart a violet coloration\r\nto flour, their presence in cornfields is most undesirable. According to\r\nPammel this plant induces sleepiness and colic.\r\n\r\n=Ground Ivy= (_Nepeta Glechoma_ Benth.) is, according to Schaffner,\r\npoisonous to horses. It contains a volatile oil and bitter principle, as\r\nalso does Catmint (_N. Cataria_). In a case which came before the Board\r\nof Agriculture and Fisheries in 1906 three horses became ill with\r\nsymptoms of poisoning, and the only weed found in the lucerne they were\r\ngetting was Ground Ivy, and this was suspected but not proved to be the\r\ncause. In a further case, reported in 1909, eleven horses were believed\r\nto have been poisoned by this weed, and in one of the dead horses\r\nscarcely any food but Ground Ivy was found, and to it the veterinary\r\nsurgeon in attendance attributed death. During preceding years several\r\nhorses had died in the locality (Ely), owing, it was believed, to\r\npoisoning by the same weed. The losses, however, were not _proved_ to be\r\ndue to this plant.\r\n\r\nIn the _Veterinary Journal_ (October, 1914, p. 515) poisoning of horses\r\nby this weed was noted (after Ferenczhazsy in the _Recueil de Médecine\r\nVétérinaire_). The author observed nine cases of intoxication due to the\r\nweed, though it is stated that it “has occasioned no trouble in cattle\r\nand sheep that consumed it.” The symptoms in horses were “anxious look,\r\ndyspnœa, salivation, sweating, dilatation of the pupils, cyanosis, signs\r\nof pulmonary œdema.” Two horses died. In 1913 similar cases were\r\nobserved by other owners, and terminated fatally.\r\n\r\nHooker states that _N. Glechoma_ is “bitter and aromatic, formerly used\r\nfor beer, occasionally for tea.”\r\n\r\n=Orache= (_Atriplex_ sp.). So far as known these plants are not\r\npoisonous, but it may be stated that Greshoff found the seeds of five\r\nspecies, and the leaves of two species, to contain a _Saponin_.\r\n\r\n=Nettles= (_Urtica_ sp.). Nettles are not generally regarded as\r\npoisonous otherwise than as causing painful nettle rash on the bare\r\nskin, but _Urtica dioica_ L. is stated to have caused the death of dogs\r\n(_Berliner Tierärztliche Wochenschrift_, 1909).\r\n\r\n=Yellow Flag= (_Iris Pseud-acorus_ L.). The wild Flag was noted by\r\nLinnæus as dangerous to cattle, but no case of actual poisoning has been\r\nfound in the literature. The plant is stated to have marked emetic and\r\npurgative properties, and Cornevin remarks that in Belgium intense\r\ngastro-enteritis is attributed to it. It contains the glucoside _Iridin_\r\n(C_{24}H_{26}O_{13}).\r\n\r\n=Narcissus= sp. Various Narcissi (_e.g._ _N. pseudo-narcissus_, _N.\r\npoeticus_, and others) have been regarded as irritant to the hands.\r\nThey would rarely if ever be eaten by live-stock in Britain, but it\r\nis stated that on the Continent many poisonings of cattle, goats,\r\nand pigs have been recorded, not infrequently ending in death after\r\ntwo or three days. The Narcissi are strongly narcotic, emetic, and\r\npurgative, and cause dilated pupils. Pott states that they cause\r\ninflammation of the digestive tract, and convulsions, sometimes with\r\nfatal results; and according to Pammel _N. poeticus_ induces intense\r\ngastro-enteritis. _N. pseudo-narcissus_ contains the alkaloid\r\n_Narcissine_ (C_{16}H_{17}O_{4}N), which with cats causes nausea and\r\npurgation (Henry).\r\n\r\n=Common Fritillary= (_Fritillaria Meleagris_ L.). The Fritillary or\r\nSnake’s Head occurs only in a few places in England, and truly wild\r\nperhaps only rarely in southern and eastern counties—not in Scotland or\r\nIreland. No definite case of poisoning has been found in the literature,\r\nbut the plant is stated to be poisonous. It contains the bitter alkaloid\r\n_Imperialine_ (C_{35}H_{60}NO_{4}), which is a heart poison.\r\n\r\n=Bog Asphodel= (_Narthecium ossifragum_ Huds.) has by some been regarded\r\nas a poisonous plant, and Müller says that the poisoning of cows has\r\nbeen recorded, and also that a cat died after drinking the milk of an\r\naffected cow. The toxic property is believed to be the glucoside\r\n_Narthecin_.\r\n\r\n=Molinia caerulea=, _Moench_. A short account by Pott shows that when\r\nforming the principal part of moorland pasture grasses, and hence\r\nextensively eaten, this grass causes brittleness of the bones of stock,\r\nand in sheep chlorosis and wool eating. It also induces hæmaturia, but\r\nif free from parasitic fungi (_e.g._ _Claviceps microcephala_) and not\r\ncovered with microscopic, sharp crystals, is quite harmless if only\r\neaten as a secondary or incidental fodder. This grass seems to be very\r\npoor in lime (Immendorf, 1898), and Schulze and Castoro found the\r\ninternodes of the stem to contain a considerable quantity of a pentosan\r\n(Xylan). It is poor in nutritive constituents. The harm done is due\r\nperhaps in part to this fact, and in part to more or less accidental or\r\noccasional constituents (as 0·046 per cent. of lead oxide in a case of\r\nthe var. _altissima_ near some lead works). Plants said to be\r\noccasionally similarly harmful are _Juncus_ sp., _Nepeta Glechoma_, and\r\n_Hieracium Pilosella_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n                     THE EFFECTS OF PLANTS ON MILK.\r\n\r\n\r\nA number of poisonous plants have a considerable influence on the milk\r\nyield of animals which eat them, reducing it in volume or in fat\r\ncontent, or imparting to it an unpleasant flavour which renders it unfit\r\nfor human consumption, and even affecting the butter made from it. Other\r\nplants not actually poisonous also affect milk by “tainting” it, and\r\nmust therefore be considered harmful otherwise than as mere weeds. Still\r\nothers affect milk by causing it to be stained with blood, and in some\r\ncases the toxic principle of the plant concerned is even stated to have\r\nrendered the milk poisonous. It will be useful to give here a brief\r\naccount of milk-affecting plants, though it is probable that there may\r\nbe others which are not mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe plants best known in this connection are the Garlics (_Allium\r\noleraceum_ L., _A. ursinum_ L., _A. vineale_ L., and others), which\r\nimpart to milk a strong “oniony” flavour. These plants also seriously\r\naffect the flesh of animals which eat them, even rendering it unfit for\r\nconsumption. A case came before the author several years ago in which a\r\nconsiderable number of sheep had eaten a quantity of _Allium ursinum_,\r\nwhich was growing in a field in which they had been grazing for some\r\ndays. The meat was so strongly tainted that, as the owner (a butcher)\r\nstated, it was quite unfit for sale. The only thing to be done was to\r\npasture the sheep elsewhere for a time.\r\n\r\nPott notes that species of _Ranunculus_ give rise to reddish or bitter\r\nmilk (_Mölkereizeitung_, 1897), while _Caltha palustris_ causes loss of\r\nmilk production in cows.\r\n\r\n_Ranunculus repens_ imparts a strong unpleasant flavour to the milk of\r\ncows that have eaten it, and the butter made from such milk is\r\ndistinctly bitter in taste (Güssow).\r\n\r\n_Ranunculus sceleratus_ causes a falling-off in milk-yield. (Cornevin.)\r\n\r\n_Alliaria officinalis_ Andrz, imparts an oniony flavour to milk.\r\n\r\n_Achillea Millefolium_ L. is stated to impart its bitter taste and\r\nstrong odour to dairy products when eaten by cows. It contains an\r\nalkaloid, _Achilleine_ (C_{20}H_{38}O_{15}N_{2}) having a peculiar odour\r\nand bitter taste.\r\n\r\n_Chrysanthemum Leucanthemum_ has also been suspected of imparting a bad\r\nflavour to butter.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pott the milk of cows eating _Oxalis Acetosella_ is with\r\ndifficulty converted into butter.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous principle of _Colchicum autumnale_ is stated to find its\r\nway into the milk of animals consuming it, and Müller states that the\r\nmilk of goats which have eaten it has caused the poisoning of infants.\r\n\r\nMüller states that a cat died after drinking the milk of a cow suffering\r\nfrom poisoning by _Narthecium ossifragum_.\r\n\r\n_Mercurialis annua_ is said to cause milk to be thin, “blue,” and poor\r\nin fat; while in a case already mentioned (p. 68) _M. perennis_ entirely\r\nstopped the secretion of milk.\r\n\r\nAccording to Chesnut, goats may eat quantities of _Euphorbia Lathyris_,\r\nand it is said that their milk then possesses the poisonous properties\r\nof the plants. Ingestion of other Euphorbias appears to have the same\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nCornevin remarks that _Melampyrum arvense_ is considered to influence\r\ncows to produce more milk.\r\n\r\nAccording to some authorities species of _Equisetum_ check milk\r\nproduction or cause it to cease, and _E. palustre_ is stated by Weber to\r\ncause the milk of affected cows to become watery, poor in fat, and give\r\nrise to a greasy and unappetising butter, while the yield may soon quite\r\nfail.\r\n\r\nThe ingestion of the foliage of the oak (_Quercus_ sp.) is stated by\r\nCornevin to induce _Maladie des Bois_, with reduction or entire loss of\r\nmilk production (see p. 69). Acorns have also affected milk production,\r\nand a case is recorded (_The Dairy_, 1913) in which it is stated that\r\ncheese made from the milk of cows which had fed on acorns developed a\r\nsharp acid flavour when about four weeks old, though the texture was\r\ngood. It is not clear, however, how it was proved to be due to the\r\nacorns.\r\n\r\nIn one case recorded a reddish tinge was observed in the milk of a cow\r\nsuffering from Rhododendron poisoning (p. 46), and in general reduced\r\nmilk production appears to occur.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the foregoing, there is good authority for saying that\r\nthe following plants may impart a disagreeable flavour to milk, and in\r\nmany cases the butter made from it:—\r\n\r\n             _Anthemis arvensis_L.      (Corn Chamomile).\r\n             _Anthemis Cotula_L.        (Stinking Mayweed).\r\n             _Artemisia Absinthium_ L.  (Wormwood).\r\n             _Conium maculatum_ L.      (Hemlock).\r\n             _Hyoscyamus niger_ L.      (Henbane).\r\n             _Matricaria Chamomilla_ L. (Wild Chamomile).\r\n             _Pinguicula vulgaris_ L.   (Butterwort).\r\n             _Senebiera didyma_ Pers.   (Lesser Wartcress).\r\n             _Sium angustifolium_ L.    (Lesser Sium).\r\n             _Sium latifolium_ L.       (Water Parsnip).\r\n             _Tanacetum vulgare_ L.     (Tansy).\r\n             _Thlaspi arvense_ L.       (Penny Cress).\r\n\r\n           (See also Index “Milk, plants affecting,” p. 117.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                 PLANTS WHICH CAUSE MECHANICAL INJURY.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of plants which, while not necessarily physiological\r\npoisons, may induce injuries of a severe character when taken by\r\nanimals, and by causing festering may bring about septic poisoning. For\r\nexample the sharp pointed fruits of _Stipa pinnata_ and _Nardus stricta_\r\nmay cause injury to the skin and mouth, piercing the palate and causing\r\ninflammation, and when eaten may even perforate the wall of the\r\nintestine and cause death; and the awned glumes of species of _Bromus_\r\nor the spikelets of Hordeum may injure the gums, causing inflammation,\r\nulceration, sores, the formation of pus, and loss of teeth. The _Bromus_\r\nand _Hordeum_, also, together with over-matured “heads” of _Trifolium\r\nincarnatum_, may give rise to Phytobezoars or balls in the stomach of\r\nhorses and cattle (60, 119). The sharp pointed fruits of _Erodium\r\ncicutarium_ may cause local irritation by working into the wool of\r\nsheep. _Aira caespitosa_ may also cause injury to the mouth of stock.\r\n\r\nA case is recorded in New South Wales in which cattle and horses ate\r\nShepherd’s Purse (_Capsella Bursa-pastoris_). The cattle were\r\nunaffected, but the horses scoured, though most of them soon recovered\r\nwhen removed from the cultivated paddock containing the weed. Two young\r\nhorses, however, showed signs of colic, became bloated, and died. It was\r\nthen found that they contained balls of fibrous material (one weighed 1\r\nlb. 9½ oz.) which consisted to the extent of nearly 50 per cent. of\r\nfibres from Shepherd’s Purse, and death was due to simple mechanical\r\nobstruction of the bowel (155).\r\n\r\nChickweed (_Stellaria media_) has been found to cause digestive disorder\r\nin lambs and sheep when eaten in large quantities (48), and has caused\r\nthe death of many a lamb. It would appear to be due entirely to the\r\nformation of large lumps of the weed in the stomach, and subsequent\r\nfermentation (_Farmer and Stockbreeder_, Mar. 16, 1908).\r\n\r\nAccording to Cornevin, Black Bindweed (_P. Convolvulus_ L.) may prove\r\ninjurious, owing to the occurrence of the hard, trigonous, and pointed\r\n“seeds” in cereal grains. Galtier published facts which show that oats\r\nwhich contain too many of the “seeds” may, by prolonged use, occasion a\r\nmore or less serious enteritis, which is sometimes fatal, particularly\r\nwhen the grain is fed to greedy horses which scarcely grind their food\r\n(73). The fruits or “seeds” of Knot-weed (_Polygonum Aviculare_ L.) may\r\nsimilarly prove injurious, and probably the seeds of other plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n                       CLASSIFICATION OF POISONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe classification of poisonous plants according to their effects is a\r\nsomewhat difficult process, since more than one prominent symptom may be\r\nproduced by the same plant. Two classifications, however, may be given\r\nas examples, the first that of Blyth, and the second that of A. B.\r\nSmith. These must be regarded as essentially applicable to human beings,\r\nthough serving more or less as a guide in case of poisoning of farm\r\nlive-stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Blyth’s Classification (after Pammel).\r\n\r\n  =A.—Poisons causing death immediately or in a few minutes=: Prussic\r\n  acid, cyanides, oxalic acid, and occasionally strychnine.\r\n\r\n  =B.—Irritant Poisons=, with symptoms chiefly pain, vomiting, and\r\n  purging: Ergot, digitalis, colchicum, yew, laburnum.\r\n\r\n  =C.—Irritant and Narcotic Poisons=, with symptoms of an irritant\r\n  nature, with more or less cerebral indications: Oxalic acid or\r\n  oxalates.\r\n\r\n  =D.—Poisons more especially affecting the Nervous System=:\r\n\r\n  1. NARCOTICS.—Symptoms: insensibility, which may be preceded by more\r\n  or less cerebral excitement. Opium.\r\n\r\n  2. DELIRIANTS.—Delirium, for the most part, a prominent symptom:\r\n  Belladonna, hyoscyamus, stramonium, and other _Solanaceæ_, Lolium\r\n  temulentum, Oenanthe crocata, poisonous fungi.\r\n\r\n  3. CONVULSIVES.—Almost every poison has been known to produce\r\n  convulsive effects, but the only true convulsive poisons are the\r\n  alkaloids of the strychnine class.\r\n\r\n  4. COMPLEX NERVOUS PHENOMENA.—Aconite, digitalis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  A. Bernhard Smith’s Classification.\r\n\r\n=A.—Poisons acting on the Brain.=\r\n\r\n  1.
