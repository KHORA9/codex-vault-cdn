C. OCTOBER 8, 1921. VOL. 4, No. 15\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWERS HOLD CLOVER SEED FOR HIGHER PRICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuality of 1921 Crop About Same as That of last Year--Alsike Clover Seed\r\nMovement Normal.\r\n\r\nThe movement of red clover seed from growers’ hands has been below\r\nnormal, but that of alsike clover has been fully normal, according to\r\nreports received by the Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates during the\r\nweek ending Oct. 1. There is a tendency on the part of the growers of\r\nred clover seed to hold their seed because the crop, which is now being\r\nthrashed in many sections, is not turning out any better than was\r\nexpected at harvest time and as reported in The Market Reporter for\r\nSept. 10.\r\n\r\nAlthough clover prices on Sept. 27 were mostly 50¢ to $1 per 100 lbs.\r\nlower than they were a month ago, they have shown little or no change\r\nduring the past week or ten days. The quality of red and alsike clover\r\nis about equal or slightly inferior to that of last year’s stock. Rains\r\nduring the last two weeks of September have discolored or bleached much\r\nof the seed in some sections.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOVEMENT SLOW.\r\n\r\n_Red Clover._--In a number of important sections only 5 to 25% of the\r\nred clover seed crop had been sold by growers at the end of September.\r\nThis season’s movement, however, has exceeded the belated movement of\r\nthe 1920 crop, but has been a little slower than usual. Growers see\r\nevidences of a short crop in their immediate vicinity, and in view of\r\nthe fact that prices offered are on an average $2 to $4 per 100 lbs.\r\nlower than last year, and $25 to $28 lower than two years ago at a\r\ncorresponding time, they are not inclined to sell freely. In a few\r\nsections, particularly southwestern Ohio and southeastern Iowa, the\r\nmovement has been considerably above normal, the growers already having\r\nsold 45% and 35%, respectively, of their crops.\r\n\r\nThe average prices offered to growers in various sections on Sept. 27\r\nfor clean seed, as shown in the accompanying table, ranged from $14.60\r\nper 100 lbs. in southwestern Iowa to $17.25 in southwestern Ohio,\r\ncompared with a range of $17.25 to $22 at a corresponding time last\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe imports of red clover seed during July, August, and September\r\ntotaled 1,792,900 lbs. compared with 305,200 lbs. during the same months\r\na year ago. These heavy imports of old seed from Europe and South\r\nAmerica have tended to depress prices for domestic seed. French, German,\r\nand Italian correspondents state that large quantities of red clover\r\nseed were sold during July and August and consequently stocks of old\r\nseed have been reduced greatly. The 1921 crop in these and other\r\nEuropean countries was reported to be much below normal because of the\r\ndrought during the summer, and it will be needed for sowing the acreage\r\nthere next spring.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the seed in this country varies considerably in different\r\nsections, being better than last year in southern Wisconsin, Ohio,\r\nMinnesota, South Dakota, and Idaho and somewhat poorer in central\r\nIllinois, and Indiana, Michigan, and parts of other States.\r\n\r\n_Alsike Clover._--In practically all of the important producing sections\r\na larger percentage of the crop had left growers’ hands by Oct. 1 than\r\non the same date last year. It is estimated that about two-fifths of the\r\nmarketable surplus had been sold by growers by that date. On Sept. 27\r\ngrowers were being offered $13.05 to $16 per 100 lbs. for clean seed\r\ncompared with prices a year ago of $18.40 to $24.50 and two years ago of\r\n$36.20 to $40.\r\n\r\nMost of the reports indicated that the quality of the 1921 crop was\r\napproximately the same as that of last year; the reports indicating a\r\ndifference in quality between the 1921 and 1920 crops were about equally\r\ndivided, some stating that the quality was better and others stating\r\nthat it was inferior.\r\n\r\nThe imports of alsike clover seed from July 1 to Sept. 30 were 1,106,700\r\nlbs., compared with 109,700 lbs. for the same period last year. The crop\r\nin Ontario, Canada, which contributes the large bulk of the alsike\r\nclover seed that is annually imported into this country is less than\r\nnormal and is estimated to be 60% of the 1920 crop. The decreased\r\nproduction of this seed in the United States and Canada has caused\r\nprices to remain rather firm since harvest.\r\n\r\n=Red Clover Seed Prices and Movement.=\r\n\r\n  ------------+----------------------+--------------------------\r\n              |Prices offered growers|    Percentage of 1921,\r\n  State or    |     per 100 lbs.,    |      1920, and 1919\r\n   section.   |  basis clean seed.   |      crops sold by\r\n              |                      |      growers by--\r\n              +-------+------+-------+--------+--------+--------\r\n              | Sept. | Oct. | Sept. |  Sept. |   Oct. |  Sept.\r\n              |  27,  |  5,  |  30,  |   27,  |    5,  |   30,\r\n              | 1921. |1920. | 1919. |  1921. |  1920. |  1919.\r\n  ------------+-------+------+-------+--------+--------+--------\r\n              |       |      |       |_P. ct._|_P. ct._|_P. ct._\r\n  Michigan    | $16.10|$20.50|$43.40 |    5   |    5   |    2\r\n  N.

The trend of\r\n  cattle prices was decidedly irregular. The hog market had a fairly\r\n  healthy tone. Sheep and lamb trade showed some improvement. The fresh\r\n  meat trade throughout the month of September was narrow (pp. 226 and\r\n  228)._\r\n\r\n  _Prices of wheat and corn futures declined steadily throughout the\r\n  week, but cash premiums strengthened in all markets excepting\r\n  Minneapolis (p. 234)._\r\n\r\n  _The movement of fruits and vegetables was near the peak of the\r\n  season, and prices declined (p. 230)._\r\n\r\n  _Definite information concerning volume of Danish imports steadied the\r\n  butter market. Cheese markets were steady under improved demand (p.\r\n  233)._\r\n\r\n  _Hay continued in light supply and prices in most markets were\r\n  unchanged. General inactivity continued in feed markets, wheat mill\r\n  feeds registering extreme Weakness (p. 236)._\r\n\r\n  _Prices of spot and future cotton continued to advance. Production\r\n  estimated at only 6,537,000 bales (p. 238)._\r\n\r\n  _The monthly Wool consumption report appears on page 239._\r\n\r\n  _The monthly table showing carload shipments of fruits and vegetables\r\n  appears on page 232._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST EXPORTS OF EVAPORATED MILK SHOW INCREASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nShipments of Evaporated Milk During August Exceed Those of\r\nCondensed--Export Prices Lower.\r\n\r\nThe movement of unsweetened evaporated milk in cases during August was\r\nconsiderably larger than that of sweetened condensed milk, and the tone\r\nof the market for the former class of goods was proportionately better,\r\nas shown by a review of the latest available reports from milk\r\nmanufacturers. The demand for bulk goods has decreased materially with\r\nthe approach of cooler weather, especially the demand from the ice-cream\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nManufacturers’ reports of total stocks on hand Sept. 1 indicate\r\napproximately the same surplus of condensed case goods as on Aug. 1, but\r\nshow a decrease of over 35% in the quantities of evaporated case goods.\r\nA similar condition prevailed with regard to unsold stocks, supplies of\r\ncondensed case goods being practically the same as on Aug. 1, while\r\nstocks of unsold evaporated case goods decreased almost 50%. Stocks of\r\ncase goods of both condensed and unsweetened evaporated milk on Sept. 1\r\nwere less than one-half the quantity reported on hand Sept. 1, 1920.\r\n\r\nThe export movement during August apparently served to give considerable\r\nrelief to the general situation. Exports totaling 22,803,000 lbs. of\r\nevaporated milk more than doubled the July exports. Exports of condensed\r\nmilk were but 7,557,000 lbs., although this was 2,000,000 lbs., heavier\r\nthan in July. The United Kingdom received the heaviest shipments,\r\n12,716,000 lbs. of evaporated and 3,232,000 lbs. of condensed going to\r\nthat country. France and Germany each received approximately 3,000,000\r\nlbs. of evaporated milk.\r\n\r\nExports of condensed milk during the first eight months of 1921 were but\r\n62,000,000 lbs., compared with more than 221,000,000 lbs. during the\r\nsame period in 1920, while exports of 116,000,000 lbs. of evaporated\r\nmilk this year are 5,000,000 lbs. heavier than the shipments in 1920.\r\n\r\nManufacturers’ selling prices to the domestic trade during August\r\nremained practically the same as during July, but reductions occurred in\r\nprices to foreign trade. The largest cuts averaging 34¢ per case were\r\nmade in export prices of sweetened condensed milk. Unsweetened\r\nevaporated milk prices to foreign trade were not so generally reduced,\r\nas some manufacturers seem to have advanced export prices slightly, with\r\nthe result that the average export price was but 4¢ less per case than\r\nduring the previous month.\r\n\r\n=Wholesale Prices of Condensed and Evaporated Milk.=\r\n\r\n(To domestic trade.)\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+---------------+---------------\r\n                       |   Sweetened   |  Unsweetened\r\n                       |   condensed   |   evaporated\r\n   Geographic section. | case of 14-oz.| case of 16-oz.\r\n                       |     cans.     |      cans.\r\n                       +---------------+---------------\r\n                       |  Aug. | July. |  Aug. |  July.\r\n  ---------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  New England          | $6.07 | $6.16 | $4.82 | $4.83\r\n  Middle Atlantic      |  5.95 |  5.89 |  4.88 |  4.79\r\n  South Atlantic       |  6.47 |  6.47 |  5.02 |  4.97\r\n  East North Central   |  6.41 |  6.48 |  4.52 |  4.64\r\n  West North Central   |  6.38 |  6.44 |  4.76 |  4.75\r\n  South Central        |  6.49 |  6.53 |  4.91 |  5.05\r\n  Western (North)      |  6.38 |  6.33 |  4.72 |  4.61\r\n  Western (South)      |  6.53 |  6.37 |  4.78 |  4.67\r\n                       +-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n        United States  |  6.28 |  6.26 |  4.83 |  4.78\r\n  ---------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\n=Prices to Producers at Condenseries for 3.5% Milk.=\r\n\r\n(Per 100 lbs.)\r\n\r\n  --------------------+----------------+----------------\r\n                      |By manufacturers|By manufacturers\r\n                      |    of case     |    of bulk\r\n   Geographic section.|    and bulk    |  goods only.\r\n                      |    goods.      |\r\n                      |----------------+----------------\r\n                      | Sept. |  Aug.  | Sept. |  Aug.\r\n  --------------------+-------+--------+-------+--------\r\n  New England         | $1.91 | $1.91  | $3.30 | $3.30\r\n  Middle Atlantic     |  2.23 |  2.06  |  2.17 |  2.14\r\n  South Atlantic      |  2.15 |  1.88  |  1.66 |  1.87\r\n  East North Central  |  1.84 |  1.85  |  1.88 |  1.87\r\n  West North Central  |  1.80 |  1.80  |  1.77 |  1.40\r\n  Western (North)     |  1.77 |  1.53  |  2.23 |  2.30\r\n  Western (South)     |  1.73 |  1.61  |   ... |   ...\r\n                      |-------+--------+-------+--------\r\n        United States |  1.87 |  1.87  |  2.04 |  2.06\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n=Stocks and Exports of Condensed and Evaporated Milk.=\r\n\r\n[In thousands of pounds; i. e., 000 omitted.]\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+--------------+-------------+---------------\r\n                       |Sept. 1, 1921.|Aug. 1, 1921.| Sept. 1, 1920.\r\n                       +-------+------+------+------+-------+-------\r\n            Stocks.    |  Case | Bulk | Case | Bulk |  Case |  Bulk\r\n                       | goods.|goods.|goods.|goods.| goods.| goods.\r\n  ---------------------+-------+------+------+------+-------+-------\r\n  CONDENSED.           |       |      |      |      |       |\r\n  Total stocks         | 31,773|26,654|30,541|28,529| 71,341|32,766\r\n  Total unsold stocks  | 21,574|19,074|21,588|24,476| 58,577| 8,733\r\n  Total unfilled orders|    339|   ...|   425|    14|    300|   ...\r\n  EVAPORATED.          |       |      |      |      |       |\r\n  Total stocks         | 90,503|   770|45,867|   739|170,198|   851\r\n  Total unsold stocks  | 36,149|   763|68,658|   719|103,812|   738\r\n  Total unfilled orders|  6,039|   ...|10,025|   ...|  3,482|   ...\r\n  ---------------------+-------+------+------+------+-------+-------\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n     Exports.    |Aug., 1921.|July, 1921.|Aug., 1920.\r\n  ---------------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n  Condensed milk |    7,557  |    5,727  |  20,503\r\n  Evaporated milk|   22,803  |   11,611  |   5,100\r\n                 +-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n      Total      |   30,360  |   17,338  |  25,603\r\n  ---------------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Live Stock and Meats_\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAVY RECEIPTS FEATURE WEEK’S LIVE STOCK BUSINESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrend of Cattle Prices Decidedly Irregular--Hog Market Has Fairly\r\nHealthy Tone.\r\n\r\n(Chicago, East St. Louis, Kansas City, Omaha, and St. Paul.)\r\n\r\nReceipts of live stock during the closing week of September were of\r\ngenerous volume despite the fact that conditions in some departments of\r\nthe trade during the preceding week bordered on demoralization. An\r\nincreased proportion of trashy, light-weight cattle indicated that\r\nproducers were anxious to liquidate surplus holdings before stormy\r\nweather sets in, while a corresponding decrease in receipts of corn-feds\r\nsuggested a decreased number of well-conditioned beef cattle in feeders’\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nChicago’s cattle receipts for the week were the largest since January,\r\nwhile the combined ten-market supply of about 242,300 cattle was\r\npractically the same as the week previous but 41,000 short of the\r\ncorresponding week a year ago.\r\n\r\nFollowing the descent of hog prices during the preceding week to the\r\nlowest levels of the year, the marketward movement of hogs expanded\r\nmaterially, the ten-market total at approximately 436,000 being 40,000\r\nin excess of the week previous, and nearly 60,000 greater than the same\r\nweek last year. The hog run, while continuing to carry an abnormally\r\nlarge proportion of heavy packing sows for this period of the year,\r\nshowed a considerably enlarged quota Of spring-farrowed, light and\r\nunderweight stock and average weights decreased at most points. The\r\ndisposition shown by producers in many sections to unload pigs and\r\nimmature light hogs was anything but a bullish influence on prices but a\r\nrevival of eastern shipping demand assisted in checking the decline.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEEP AND LAMB RECEIPTS LARGE.\r\n\r\nReceipts of sheep and lambs for the week both at Chicago and numerous\r\nother western points were the largest of the year, the ten-market total\r\nof about 419,500 exceeding the previous week’s supply by approximately\r\n38,000 and being nearly 1,000 in excess of those of the same week last\r\nyear. The crop, however, carried a heavy proportion of feeders from the\r\nwestern range and the market displayed gratifying stability following\r\nthe slump in prices during the week previous, which was one of the most\r\nsevere slumps of the season.\r\n\r\n_Cattle._--Higher prices for most grades of beef steers showing\r\neffective corn feeding, further seasonal expansion in the movement of\r\nboth native and western grass cattle, and further evidences of\r\nincreasing interest on the part of stocker and feeder buyers featured\r\nthe cattle trade during the week under review. The trend of prices at\r\nthe different market centers was decidedly irregular. Omaha, where\r\nreceipts were considerably lighter than the preceding week, showed\r\nadvances on practically all classes of cattle. Other River markets under\r\nreview showed irregular declines on grass cattle and comparatively\r\nlittle change on desirable corn-feds. At Chicago, where receipts of\r\nnorthwestern range cattle were nearly double the largest previous run\r\nthis season, grass steers and the less desirable of the warmed-up and\r\nplain, heavy, fed steers sold steady to 25¢ lower, and the better\r\ngrades of corn-fed steers, including yearlings, all the way from 10¢ to\r\n50¢ higher.\r\n\r\nThe return of $11 cattle after an absence dating back to last January,\r\nmarked the week’s trading at Chicago. Two lots of prime Angus and\r\nHereford yearlings averaging 985 lbs. and 891 lbs., respectively,\r\nbrought that price. The former consignment was made up of natives from\r\nan Iowa feed lot, nearly half of which were heifers. The other lot\r\nconsisted of Illinois-fed, branded steers which originally came from\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nThe popularity at all market centers of well-finished yearlings on the\r\nbaby beef order and of finished 1,100-lb. to 1,300-lb. steers over the\r\nweighty and more aged bullocks was as pronounced as ever, and the price\r\npremiums earned by the former were unprecedented for this season of the\r\nyear. Thick-fat 1,400-lb. to 1,500-lb. steers of high quality and\r\nclosely approaching prime grade could not pass $9.25 at Chicago and\r\ncontrasted oddly with the moderately fat, short-fed yearlings that\r\nbrought about the same figure. Ripe steers in the 1,600-lb. to 1,760-lb.\r\nclass that had been grain-fed a year or more, sold at Chicago and Omaha\r\nat $8.25 to $8.50 with a plainer, weighty kind that had consumed\r\nconsiderable corn, down to $7.50. Many sales of good and choice\r\n1,200-lb. to 1,350-lb. steers between $8 and $8.75 were made at Chicago\r\nand elsewhere. A few loads of long yearlings averaging 1,100 lbs. to\r\n1,175 lbs. sold as high as $10 and $10.50.\r\n\r\nA generous proportion of the run, however, all around the western market\r\ncircuit consisted of branded and native grass steers of mediocre and\r\nmedium killing quality that cashed at $5 to $6.50, comparatively few\r\nstraight grass steers being good enough to bring $7. This was true\r\ndespite the fact that two loads of Montanas reached $7.25 at Chicago.\r\nLight grass steers of common quality but carrying enough flesh to make\r\ncheap carcass beef, sold as low as $4.25 and $4.50 at St. Paul and\r\nMissouri River points and a few, chiefly on the Mexican order, ranged\r\ndownward from $5 at Chicago.\r\n\r\nAn increase of nearly 50% in receipts of northwestern grass cattle at\r\nChicago was credited in part to the 20% cut in long-haul freight rates.\r\nThe week’s total of about 13,000 cattle from that source, however, was\r\nbut little more than half as large as similar receipts during the\r\ncorresponding week last year. It seems probable, however, that the\r\nNorthwest will ship more freely during October, as after this month\r\nstormy weather is likely to put an end to cattle roundups.\r\n\r\nLiberal receipts of low and medium grade steers and their cheapness “on\r\nthe hooks” as compared with most grades of she stock had a depressing\r\neffect on cow and heifer prices at all markets covered by this report\r\nexcept Omaha. At the latter market light receipts forced cow prices up\r\nalong with those of most other classes of cattle. Canners and choice\r\ndry-fed heifer yearlings withstood the downward tendency and held about\r\nsteady.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHE-STOCK PRICES BREAK.\r\n\r\nThe break in she-stock prices ranged anywhere from 25¢. to $1. Declines\r\nwere most severe at Chicago, where medium to good grades of fat cows and\r\nthe same classes of grass heifers frequently showed a break of 75¢. to\r\n$1 compared with the previous week-end. A spread of $3.75 to $5.75 took\r\nthe big end of the week’s supply of grass cows and heifers, while\r\ncanners and cutters ranged largely from $2.25 to $3.25. The best of the\r\nlight, corn-fed heifer yearlings sold well in line with finished steer\r\nyearlings, but they had to be of the baby-beef type. Owing to scarcity\r\nof corn-fed cows and a slackened demand for kosher cows due to the\r\napproaching Jewish holidays, few heavy cows were good enough to bring $6\r\nat any of the large western markets.\r\n\r\nBulls sold steady to lower at most points, while calves were sharply\r\nlower at both Chicago and St. Paul, little changed at Kansas City and\r\nSt. Louis, and higher at Omaha because of meager receipts.\r\n\r\nThe demand for stock and feeding cattle, which has been gaining breadth\r\nduring recent weeks, was comparatively liberal during the closing week\r\nof September and the total movement to the country was the largest of\r\nthe year to date. Except Omaha, where stocker and feeder cattle shared\r\nin the general price upturn, prices of such cattle at points under\r\nreview were at the lowest levels of the year to date. Well-bred\r\nyearlings and light feeders were in strongest demand.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few steers on the fat cattle order, few cattle\r\nwent to the country costing over $6.75. The bulk of the feeder steers\r\nsold within a range of $5.25 to $6.25 and stockers largely between $5\r\nand $6. Some of the best stock steers, however, sold right up with the\r\nchoice heavy feeders and many plain and common light stockers sold\r\ndownward from $4.50. Kansas City reported a fully steady market for\r\nstock cows and heifers with a good many cows going out at $3.50 to $4,\r\nand many stock heifers at $4 to $5 with a few as high as $5.50.\r\n\r\n=RECEIPTS, SHIPMENTS, AND LOCAL SLAUGHTER FOR THE WEEK ENDING OCT. 1.=\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+\r\n     Markets.    |  Cattle and calves.   |         Hogs.         |\r\n                 +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n                 |  Re-  | Ship- | Local |  Re-  | Ship- | Local |\r\n                 |ceipts.| ments.|slaugh-|ceipts.| ments.|slaugh-|\r\n                 |       |       |  ter. |       |       |  ter. |\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n  Chicago        | 79,076| 25,332| 53,744|126,432| 27,148| 99,284|\r\n  Denver[1]      |  9,482|  7,767|  2,272|  2,793|   ... |  2,675|\r\n  East St. Louis | 30,067| 14,640| 10,101| 48,094| 17,536| 22,904|\r\n  Indianapolis[1]|  9,533|  4,398|  4,919| 60,437| 32,349| 27,399|\r\n  Kansas City    | 78,446| 43,851| 31,002| 28,914|  8,109| 20,926|\r\n  Oklahoma City  |  7,767|  2,509|  4,557|  4,574|    272|  4,142|\r\n  Omaha          | 35,557| 23,657| 11,900| 30,607|  5,687| 24,920|\r\n  St. Joseph[1]  | 13,639|  5,006|  9,101| 21,122|  2,953| 17,541|\r\n  St. Paul[1]    | 24,301| 13,023| 12,163| 31,339|  4,445| 27,035|\r\n  Sioux City     | 15,032| 11,659|  4,296| 28,068|  9,874| 16,285|\r\n  Wichita[1]     |  7,554|  5,422|  2,415|  4,236|    127|  4,270|\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n  Total          |310,456|157,264|146,470|356,616|108,560|267,381|\r\n  Previous week  |324,438|153,997|154,269|373,574|100,615|258,235|\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-----------------------\r\n     Markets.    |         Sheep.\r\n                 +-------+-------+-------\r\n                 |  Re-  | Ship- | Local\r\n                 |ceipts.| ments.|slaugh-\r\n                 |       |       |  ter.\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  Chicago        |148,779| 57,903| 90,876\r\n  Denver[1]      | 44,713| 34,469|  4,086\r\n  East St. Louis |  7,434|  1,081|  4,062\r\n  Indianapolis[1]|  2,823|  1,547|  1,323\r\n  Kansas City    | 47,121| 12,179| 24,234\r\n  Oklahoma City  |    165|   ... |    165\r\n  Omaha          |126,966| 73,496| 53,470\r\n  St. Joseph[1]  | 28,565|  8,123| 17,545\r\n  St. Paul[1]    | 19,209|  6,823| 12,381\r\n  Sioux City     |  8,242|  4,293|  4,564\r\n  Wichita[1]     |    399|    251|    169\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  Total          |434,416|260,165|222,875\r\n  Previous week  |403,963|169,947|213,446\r\n  ---------------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\n  [1] Week ending Friday, Sept. 30.\r\n\r\n=DAILY AVERAGE WEIGHT AND COST OF HOGS FOR WEEK ENDING OCT. 1.=\r\n\r\n[Price per 100 lbs.]\r\n\r\n  ------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n              |   Mon.  |  Tues.  |   Wed.  | Thurs.  |  Fri.   |\r\n              |         |         |         |         |         |\r\n  ------------+---+-----+---+-----+---+-----+---+-----+---+-----+\r\n              |Wt.|Cost.|Wt.|Cost.|Wt.|Cost.|Wt.|Cost.|Wt.|Cost.|\r\n  ------------+---+-----+---+-----+---+-----+---+-----+---+-----+\r\n  Chicago     |272|$7.10|255|$7.29|262|$7.31|246|$7.30|246|$7.43|\r\n  E.

While during the preceding week, average cost of\r\nhogs at the markets under review showed a decrease, Chicago prices\r\ndropping to the lowest levels since early in 1916, closing prices of the\r\nweek under review were generally 10¢ to 15¢ higher than the previous\r\nweek-end. A broader eastern demand was partly responsible for the\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nWhile the proportion of new crop hogs showed a seasonal increase at\r\npractically all points, the continued heavy receipts of packing sows\r\ncaused considerable comment. Traders at Chicago do not recall any recent\r\nperiod when receipts at this time of the year carried so large a\r\npercentage of packing sows as do current offerings. Packing sows were of\r\nalmost uniformly good quality, many of them being almost as smooth as\r\nbarrows. Several of the smaller packers at Chicago turned from heavy\r\nbarrows to good and choice sows.\r\n\r\nMany of the new-crop hogs showed very little finish and buyers\r\ncomplained that many were “dopey” apparently suffering from the effects\r\nof initial rations of new corn. On almost every day butcher hogs\r\naveraging 200 lbs. to 240 lbs. sold at top prices at Chicago, while the\r\n160-lb. to 170-lb. kinds closed considerably under top quotations.\r\n\r\nThe closing top at Chicago was $8.30 with the average cost that day\r\n$7.06. The average cost of packing and shipping droves for the week at\r\nthat point was $7.25, with the average weight at 259 lbs., the lightest\r\nsince the week ending Aug. 6. The closing top at East St. Louis was\r\n$8.35, at Kansas City $7.65, at Omaha $7.75, and at St. Paul $7.60.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEEP AND LAMB TRADE IMPROVED.\r\n\r\n_Sheep._--Considering supplies, which at leading western markets were\r\nthe heaviest of the year, sheep and lamb trade during the final week of\r\nSeptember showed some improvement. Receipts at Chicago were larger than\r\nduring any previous week since 1919 and range lambs, carrying the\r\nlargest proportion of feeders of the season, were greatly in the\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nIn the fat classes, supply and demand were evenly balanced and as the\r\nfeeder outlet developed considerable breadth, closing prices on all\r\nclasses were practically steady with the close of the week previous.\r\n\r\nSheep were generally steady at all points except Kansas City, where\r\nprices worked 25¢ to 50¢ higher on fat classes. Fat lambs closed lower\r\nfor the week at Omaha and higher at East St. Louis but were little\r\nchanged elsewhere. Feeder classes sold steady to somewhat higher at all\r\npoints. The range movement started early this summer and the early\r\nseason output of feeders was small.\r\n\r\n_Opening, Oct. 3._--Beef steers were strong to 25¢ higher at Chicago\r\nwith desirable corn-feds gaining most. River markets were generally\r\nsteady to strong on corn-feds and slow to lower on grassers. The week\r\nopened with a big run of 35,000 cattle at Kansas City. Chicago’s\r\nreceipts at 20,000 cattle were well below expectations and the supply of\r\ngood corn-fed cattle showed a marked decrease. Top yearlings reached\r\n$11.15 at Chicago, the highest point reached since early in January and\r\nwithin 10¢ of the top for the year on yearlings.\r\n\r\nWith receipts moderate, hog prices were generally strong to 15¢ higher.\r\nEast St. Louis reported a 15¢ to 25¢ advance with top hogs at $8.55. At\r\nChicago the top was $8.45 and at Omaha $8, at Kansas City $7.90 and at\r\nSt. Paul $7.50.\r\n\r\nFat sheep and lambs opened generally steady to 25¢ higher. Western fat\r\nlambs topped at $9 at Chicago, $8.50 at Omaha, and $8.40 at Kansas City.\r\nFat natives reached $8.50 at Chicago. The fat ewe top was $4.75 at\r\nChicago, $4.50 at East St. Louis, and $4.25 at Omaha. Best feeder lambs\r\nbrought $7.25 at Chicago on a firm market and $7 at Omaha.\r\n\r\n=LIVE STOCK PRICES, TUESDAY, OCT. 4.=\r\n\r\n[Per 100 lbs.]\r\n\r\n

----------------------+------------+------------+------------\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAT TRADE NARROW DURING MOST OF SEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFairly Good Demand Early in Month Not Sustained--Week-End Accumulations\r\nFrequent.\r\n\r\nFresh-meat trade during September was narrow and movements into\r\nconsumptive channels were considerably less than during August, except\r\nfor a short period at the beginning of the month when there was a fairly\r\ngood demand for all classes. Although receipts of some classes were less\r\nthan normal, week-end accumulations in wholesale markets were frequent\r\nand as a rule sharp declines followed.\r\n\r\nSupplies of beef at eastern markets were approximately 8,250,000 lbs.,\r\nor 13,800 carcasses less than a year ago. Veal supplies decreased 6,300\r\ncarcasses and mutton 32,000 carcasses. Lamb increased 63,000 carcasses,\r\nor 2,500,000 lbs. At eastern points the decrease in supplies of fresh\r\npork from locally slaughtered hogs was more than offset by increased\r\nshipments from middle western packing centers and a net increase of\r\n110,000 lbs. for the month was shown.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEF TRADE UNIMPROVED.\r\n\r\n_Beef._--Improved trade conditions which were expected to follow cooler\r\nweather did not materialize. Average weekly supplies were less than for\r\nseveral months past, but the demand was curtailed to an even greater\r\nextent. With liberal quantities of low-grade beef offered at packing\r\ncenters, increased supplies of sausage material were available, and\r\nprices in most cases were fully 50% below those prevailing a year ago.\r\nComparatively little choice beef was offered at any of the markets, and\r\nwhen it appeared in the form of heavy carcasses it was hard to move,\r\nselling only at a heavy discount. Carcasses weighing from 450 to 600\r\nlbs. were the kind most in demand.\r\n\r\nWith supplies at eastern markets consisting chiefly of medium to good\r\ngrass-fed steers, prices were uneven and during most of the month tended\r\ndownward. Boston was relatively steadier than other eastern markets and\r\nclosed only about $1 lower, while New York and Philadelphia registered\r\nsharp weekly fluctuations and closed unevenly $1 to $2 net lower.\r\nAlthough the demand at Chicago was again narrow and showed no apparent\r\nimprovement over that of the preceding month, price changes were slight.\r\nTo some extent this was caused by local conditions and the ability to\r\nadjust supplies to the demand.\r\n\r\nCow beef constituted a relatively small proportion of the offerings at\r\nall markets, and was materially less in quantity than at the same time a\r\nyear ago. Markets were not generally supplied with bulls, and in most\r\ncases daily receipts were insufficient to justify quotations.\r\n\r\nWhile kosher beef markets registered slight weekly fluctuations, the\r\nrange of prices generally was steady, though somewhat higher than in\r\nAugust. The better grades were in best demand. Because of the near\r\napproach of Yom Kippur and other Jewish holidays, kosher killing was\r\ndiscontinued during the closing days of September and any surplus\r\nsupplies were offered for sale to the regular trade.\r\n\r\n_Veal._--Liberal offerings of heavy veal carcasses, most of which were\r\nof undesirable quality, had a depressing effect on prices in general.\r\nMilk-fed veal was scarce, but when available found ready sale at firm\r\nprices. Receipts at eastern markets were 6,300 carcasses less than\r\nduring the corresponding month a year ago, but were more than the trade\r\nrequired. Price ranges were materially widened, with the trend upward\r\nduring the first week, but sharply downward through the remainder of the\r\nmonth. All markets were similarly affected. Closing prices at eastern\r\nmarkets were unevenly $2 to $3 lower than the opening, with common and\r\nmedium grades registering the greatest decline. Choice veal at Chicago\r\nclosed steady to $1 higher, with other grades mostly $2 lower than the\r\nopening.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMB TRADE CHAOTIC.\r\n\r\n_Lamb._--With continued heavy receipts of lambs at live-stock centers,\r\nthe dressed trade was in a chaotic condition. Although estimated\r\nreceipts of lamb at seven of the principal live-stock markets showed a\r\ndecrease of 12% as compared with the same month one year ago, liberal\r\nofferings of Canadian lambs at eastern markets more than offset the\r\ndecrease and intensified the already existing unsettled condition. This,\r\ntogether with the continued unequal demand, assisted in pushing prices\r\nof the dressed product below the low point reached in February of the\r\npresent year. Total supplies at eastern markets exceeded those of the\r\nsame period a year ago by 2,500,000 lbs., and fluctuations on the\r\ndifferent grades amounted to $6.\r\n\r\nWhile Chicago registered smaller fluctuations the trend was steadily\r\ndownward and closing prices were $2 to $3 below the opening. Although\r\nclosing prices at eastern markets were slightly above the low spot for\r\nthe month, trade conditions at the close were generally unsatisfactory\r\nto the selling side. At the beginning of the month cold storage holdings\r\nwere 820,519 lbs. less than a month earlier, but were still considerably\r\nabove the season’s average during prewar years.\r\n\r\n_Mutton._--Receipts of mutton at eastern markets decreased 32,000\r\ncarcasses as compared with the same period a year ago. This reduction,\r\ntogether with a general improvement in quality over that of the previous\r\nmonth, was the principal factor contributing to a generally steady\r\nmarket in the East, particularly during the last half of the month. With\r\nsupplies at Chicago consisting largely of heavy bucks and ewes and\r\npractically no handyweight wethers, that market declined sharply and\r\nclosed $1.50 to $2 below the opening.\r\n\r\n_Pork._--Conditions in the fresh-pork trade were generally unsettled.\r\nSharp weekly fluctuations caused by erratic advances on Mondays, which\r\ncould not be maintained through the week, were an outstanding feature of\r\nthe month’s trade at some markets. Supplies of loins at eastern markets\r\nwere practically the same as a year ago and consisted mostly of frozen\r\nor chilled stock, for which there was an uneven demand. The latter sold\r\nat a wide range of prices and unevenly $4 to $10 below corresponding\r\naverages of fresh loins. Closing prices at eastern markets were only\r\nslightly changed from the opening, some averages being 50¢ to $1 lower.\r\n\r\nConditions at Chicago, which has been the high market during the past\r\ntwo months, were materially changed and declines equaling the advances\r\nof late July were registered during the last half of September. From the\r\nhigh point of $32 on light average loins, prices had dropped to $26 at\r\nthe close. Heavier average loins registered similar declines. Shoulder\r\ncuts were relatively more stable but were mostly $1 to $1.50 off at the\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n_Cured pork and lard._--The domestic demand for cured pork cuts and\r\nlard, while fair for the season, was not of sufficient volume to offset\r\nthe decline in live-stock markets and prices registered sharp declines.\r\nDry salt meats and lard were in relatively better demand than hams,\r\nbacon, and picnics, and showed proportionately smaller declines. At the\r\nclose wholesale prices of hams at Chicago were off $3 to $3.50, bacon $2\r\nto $2.50, and picnics $1.50 to $2. The net decline on lard amounted to\r\n75¢, dry salt backs 50¢ to 75¢, and dry salt bellies about $1. Reacting\r\nfrom the general upward trend of prices during August, compound lard\r\nmarkets were weak and closing prices were unevenly 75¢ to $1.50 under\r\nthe opening.\r\n\r\n=STOCKER AND FEEDER SHIPMENTS.=\r\n\r\nWeek ending Friday, Sept. 30.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+-------+-----+-------\r\n                       |Cattle |     |\r\n                       |  and  |Hogs.| Sheep.\r\n                       |calves.|     |\r\n  ---------------------+-------+-----+-------\r\n  Market origin:       |       |     |\r\n    Chicago            | 11,838| ... | 41,892\r\n    East St. Louis     |  6,799|  551|  1,289\r\n    Fort Worth         |  3,097|  353|    177\r\n    Indianapolis       |  1,675|  537|    262\r\n    Kansas City        | 26,728|2,428| 10,674\r\n    Oklahoma City      |  2,504|  272|  ...\r\n    Omaha              | 21,578| ... | 54,992\r\n    St. Joseph         |  3,611|  145|  8,148\r\n    St. Paul           |  9,745|  204|  3,837\r\n    Sioux City         | 11,497|2,223|  5,651\r\n    Wichita            |  2,605|  127|  ...\r\n                       +-------+-----+-------\r\n      Total            |101,677|6,840|126,922\r\n    Previous week      | 93,564|5,770| 80,524\r\n    Same week last year|109,142|8,795|168,815\r\n                       +=======+=====+=======\r\n  State destination:   |       |     |\r\n    Arkansas           |     30|  146|  ...\r\n    California         |    364| ... |  ...\r\n    Georgia            |     78| ... |  ...\r\n    Idaho              |      2| ... |  ...\r\n    Illinois           | 16,394|1,016| 18,285\r\n    Indiana            |  5,966|  537| 13,297\r\n    Iowa               | 21,252|2,564| 27,640\r\n    Kansas             |  6,823|  538|  1,482\r\n    Kentucky           |    715| ... |  1,671\r\n    Maryland           |    162| ... |    656\r\n    Massachusetts      |     24| ... |  ...\r\n    Michigan           |  1,160| ... |  9,696\r\n    Minnesota          |  1,899|  642|  3,931\r\n    Missouri           | 13,765|  431| 15,310\r\n    Nebraska           | 17,666|  563| 24,891\r\n    New Jersey         |     19| ... |  ...\r\n    New York           |   ... | ... |    884\r\n    Ohio               |  4,112|  216|  4,607\r\n    Oklahoma           |  3,571|  126|  ...\r\n    Pennsylvania       |  4,490| ... |  ...\r\n    South Dakota       |  1,201| ... |  1,877\r\n    Tennessee          |     26| ... |  ...\r\n    Texas              |  1,190|   61|    177\r\n    Virginia           |     25| ... |  ...\r\n    West Virginia      |     56| ... |  ...\r\n    Wisconsin          |    687|1,866|  2,518\r\n                       +-------+-----+-------\r\n      Total            |101,677|6,840|126,922\r\n  ---------------------+-------+-----+-------\r\n\r\n=Iowa led all other States= in the number of telephones on farms\r\nreported to the Census Bureau on Jan. 1.

Niagaras were weak in New York at 75¢\r\nto 85¢. New York _cauliflower_ was slow and dull in Philadelphia at\r\n$1.75 per crate, and ranged $2 to $2.25 in other markets. Michigan\r\nGolden Heart _celery_ in highball crates was slow and steady in Chicago\r\nand St. Louis at $1 to $1.25 and ranged $1.75 to $2 in Pittsburgh.\r\nMassachusetts _cranberries_ were steady in Boston at $5 to $6 per\r\n¹⁄₂-barrel crate, and at $6.25 to $6.50 in Pittsburgh and Cleveland. New\r\nYork Bartlett _pears_ ranged $3.25 to $3.50 per bushel basket in leading\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n\r\nNorthern Maine Has Large Potato Crop.\r\n\r\nThe potato crop in Aroostook Co., Me., promises to be the largest ever\r\nproduced in northern Maine. Early plantings were damaged somewhat by dry\r\nweather, but the later plantings have developed fully, and the stock has\r\nbecome overgrown in many cases. The yield of Irish Cobblers will average\r\n120 to 150 bbls. to the acre, with some yields as high as 200 bbls.\r\n\r\nWith a probable demand from a wide territory there is much local\r\nconfidence in the outcome of the marketing season, especially after the\r\nfirst of the year. During the rise in the market the first week of\r\nSeptember large quantities of potatoes were sold on a basis of $3 per\r\nbbl. to the grower, but many of these shipments were marketed at a loss.\r\nLarge quantities of potatoes are being stored because of the generally\r\nlow price level. Much of the stock that is being sold is that for which\r\nstorage space can not be obtained or which must be sold for financial\r\nreasons. The growers generally feel that they should have $1.75 per 100\r\nlbs. bulk.\r\n\r\nThe first heavy frost of the season came Sept. 21, and digging of all\r\nvarieties will be pushed from now on. Shipments will continue moderately\r\nheavy and would undoubtedly become very heavy with stronger market\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nTop price of the season in New York was $1,150 per car. The general\r\nrange in June in New York was $450 to $900 and in July $250 to $550. No\r\nsales of medium sizes were reported in Philadelphia above $900 and\r\nprevailing ranges during June were $400 to $700, but declines to a range\r\nof $250 to $500 occurred in July. Sales in Boston ranged nearly as high\r\nas in New York, allowing 1,000 melons per carload. Early quotations in\r\nBoston ranged 60¢ to $1.10 per melon, but price declined in July to a\r\nrange of 30 to 65¢. Pittsburgh carlot sales ranged $500 to $1,025 in May\r\nand June and $250 to $500 in July. Chicago market quoted a top of $1,100\r\nthe last of May, but prevailing early ranges were $500 to $800 and July\r\nsales $200 to $600.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrection.\r\n\r\nIn the table “Carlot shipments of cantaloupes” on page 217 of the The\r\nMarket Reporter for Oct. 1. the last column should be headed “To Sept.\r\n17, 1920,” and the next to last column headed “To Sept. 17, 1921.”\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD BROKEN BY YEAR’S WATERMELON SHIPMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarlot Movement Double that of 1918--Crop of Excellent Quality--Prices\r\nDecline Rapidly.\r\n\r\nShipments of watermelons by the end of September somewhat exceeded\r\n44,000 cars. The movement had surpassed that of last year by nearly\r\n5,000 cars and was much larger than that of any preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe great Florida-Georgia-South Carolina melon section has shipped about\r\n25,000 cars. Three other States, Texas, California, and Missouri,\r\nshipped 3,000 to 5,000 cars each; Alabama and North Carolina shipped\r\nover 1,000 each; Arkansas, Indiana, Oklahoma, 400 to 700 each; and 14\r\nother States in smaller amounts. The season’s movement not only has\r\nexceeded the previous record-breaking volume of 1920 but is one-half\r\ngreater than that of 1919 or of 1917 and more than double that of 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCREASE IN PRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nProduction the past three years has tended to increase rapidly in nearly\r\nall the leading watermelon States. Nearly 30,000 acres were planted in\r\nTexas compared with 38,000 in Georgia, the leading State, but shipments\r\nfrom Texas were greatly reduced by unfavorable weather. In most other\r\nsections conditions were favorable. Taking the watermelon section as a\r\nwhole, there was a greater production from an acreage about the same as\r\nin 1920.\r\n\r\nThe East has been aggressively increasing its hold on the commercial\r\nproduction of watermelons during the past few seasons. Of the 5,000 cars\r\nconstituting this season’s excess of shipments as compared with the\r\nmovement last year, 3,000 cars came from the Southeast, about 1,000 cars\r\nfrom the Middle West, and a few hundred cars from the Far West.\r\n\r\nThe 1921 crop for the most part was of excellent grade. The size of\r\nFlorida melons was reduced by drought, but conditions improved as the\r\ngrowing season moved northward.\r\n\r\nThe 1921 season opened with prices as high as in any preceding season.\r\nFirst sales in May exceeded $1,000 per car for medium sizes in New York,\r\nChicago, and Pittsburgh. Similar prices were reported at the opening of\r\nthe 1920 season and there were a few opening sales of medium size melons\r\naround $1,000 in 1919. In 1918 ranges in the early part of the season\r\nwere only about one-half those of 1919 and were still lower in 1917 and\r\n1916.\r\n\r\nPrices in 1921 were not so well sustained as in 1920. During July heavy\r\nshipments from Georgia depressed the markets rapidly. July opened with\r\ncarlot sales at $250 to $650 in city markets, but the range soon\r\ndeclined, reaching $200 to $250. The first week of August prices reached\r\nthe low point of the season at $150 to $250 per car but recovered about\r\n$25 toward the end of the season of heavy shipments.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLINE RAPID.\r\n\r\nPrices opened at $300 to $515 f. o. b. Florida shipping points with top\r\nof $625, but declined rapidly with the beginning of the Georgia shipping\r\nseason.

New York; Vegetable Prices Dull and Lower.\r\n\r\nPrices of apples in barrels continued firm in the New York market\r\nthroughout the week from Sept. 26 to Oct. 1, principally on account of\r\nlight arrivals of good stock. Prices of boxed stock declined on account\r\nof heavier arrivals, but the trade is still looking for large red stock,\r\nand taking it readily.\r\n\r\nPotatoes continued in light demand with very liberal supplies, and\r\nprices gradually declined until Maine Cobblers in 165-lb. sacks reached\r\n$2.75 to $3, with few buyers.\r\n\r\nReceipts of good onions were light with prices firm.\r\n\r\nPeaches from New York were in light supply and mostly of only fair\r\ncondition and poor color. Demand was moderate with good stock selling\r\nreadily for $4.50 to $5 a bu.; ordinary and poor stock sold slowly in a\r\n$2 to $4 range.\r\n\r\nSweet potatoes eased off considerably in price. Grapes were dull\r\nthroughout the week selling slowly at the lowest figures yet realized.\r\nCabbage was not in demand and prices gradually declined closing at $30\r\nto $35 per ton for New York domestic. The first car of California\r\ntomatoes arrived on Thursday, but with heavy supplies of nearby stock on\r\nhand, did not sell so readily as was anticipated. The tomatoes were in\r\nexcellent condition, with a few slightly overripe. Best lugs sold at\r\n$1.75 to $2 with ripe stock at $1.50, but were not cleaned up and sold\r\nat $1.25 to $1.50 the following day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dairy and Poultry_\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITE IMPORT INFORMATION STEADIES BUTTER MARKET.\r\n\r\n\r\nTendency Toward Higher Prices--Danish Butter Has Sentimental Effect on\r\nMarket.\r\n\r\nButter trading was on a more confident basis during the week ending Oct.\r\n1 and the markets developed a steadier tone as a result of definite\r\ninformation regarding the quantities of Danish butter expected to be\r\navailable in the near future. The persistent rumors of large shipments\r\nwhich during the previous week were partly responsible for the unsettled\r\ncondition were soon quieted, and operators took a more conservative\r\nattitude. There was less pressure to sell and buyers were inclined to\r\npurchase more freely.\r\n\r\nPrice changes were small, but there was a general tendency toward a\r\nhigher level, advances of ¹⁄₂¢ to 1¢ being registered on all markets on\r\nthe finer grades of butter. At times the supply of fancy butter was\r\nsomewhat in excess of the demand, but any efforts on the part of the\r\nsellers to get prices down were always met with an active buying demand\r\nfrom distributors and speculators. It was a good, steady market with\r\nholders usually free sellers and buyers taking immediate requirements\r\nreadily at current prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKET ON UNDERGRADES IMPROVED.\r\n\r\nThe market for undergrades was somewhat more active. The heavy supply of\r\nlast week showed but little if any reduction, and current receipts\r\nconsisted largely of undergrade butter. The quality of receipts\r\ngenerally was reported considerably better during the week and this no\r\ndoubt was largely the cause of the improved market in undergrades. More\r\ninterest was shown in undergrades by buyers who bought for immediate\r\nneeds or who got such price concessions as to make their purchases\r\nbargains, but as a rule dealers found it impossible to move all their\r\nundergrades even at large price reductions.\r\n\r\nReceipts for the week show but little change from previous weeks. It was\r\ngenerally expected that production would gradually decrease in spite of\r\nthe fact that conditions for a good fall production have been favorable.\r\nHence, the latest available report from the American Association of\r\nCreamery Butter Manufacturers showing an increase of 9.8% over last year\r\nand an increase of 0.44% over the previous week came as a surprise. The\r\nstorage holdings for the four markets showed a marked decrease during\r\nthe week. The decrease was most pronounced at Chicago, indicating a\r\nmovement of storage butter from there to other markets.\r\n\r\nThe S. S. _Frederick VIII_ arrived during the week, carrying a cargo of\r\n1,250 casks of Danish butter, which did not become available until\r\nFriday. Part of this butter was reported sold at prices ranging from\r\n44³⁄₄¢ to 45¹⁄₂¢, depending upon the size of the lot. The S. S.\r\n_Heligolav_ and _Drottingholm_ now afloat with combined cargoes\r\nestimated at between 3,000 and 4,000 casks. The _Oscar II_, which sailed\r\nfrom Copenhagen on Sept. 30, is also expected to carry some butter. The\r\neffect of the Danish butter on the markets has been largely sentimental,\r\ncausing operators to act somewhat more conservatively.\r\n\r\n=WHOLESALE PRICES OF BUTTER AND CHEESE FOR WEEK ENDING

forty-three cases of frozen eggs\r\nweighing 1,200,564 lbs., also 448 cases of dried eggs weighing 48,800\r\nlbs., were unloaded from the British steamship _Gothicstar_ from China\r\nat San Francisco Sept. 15. The shipment is one of the largest ever\r\nreceived in this country.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 19 the _Gothicstar_ sailed for New York with a cargo of 59,108\r\ncases of frozen eggs and 6,190 cases of dried eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE MARKETS BECOME STEADY UNDER IMPROVED DEMAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouthern Buying Materially Increased--Considerable Quantities of\r\nCanadian Cheese Bought.\r\n\r\nThe tone of cheese markets was at least steady during the week ending\r\nOct. 1, although prices which prevailed in Wisconsin during the week\r\nsuggested a somewhat unsettled feeling. Prices on Wisconsin cheese\r\nboards advanced again Sept. 28, although the advances were for the most\r\npart small and were confined to the larger styles. Some dealers quoted\r\nprices representing very close margins, and this probably accounted for\r\nmore or less variation in f. o. b. selling prices on different days of\r\nthe week.\r\n\r\nDaisies and Twins were good sellers throughout the week, Longhorns being\r\nthe only style which was especially slow. Buying in the South showed a\r\nmaterial increase. There was also considerable inquiry from southern\r\nbuyers. Practically all of the southern business went direct to\r\nWisconsin rather than through distributing market dealers.\r\n\r\n\r\nRETAIL DEMAND INCREASED.\r\n\r\nThe very low prices quoted by Canadian dealers and the resulting sales\r\nhad a noticeable effect in distributing markets. Goods from Canada at\r\nprices around 17¹⁄₄¢ to 18¢ delivered at New York looked so attractive\r\nto a number of buyers who anticipate heavier export demand later in the\r\nseason, that considerable quantities were purchased. Only a small\r\nquantity of this cheese has actually been imported as yet, according to\r\ncurrent reports, the bulk of it remaining in Canadian storages. The\r\nlarge Canadian Cheddars are not entirely suitable for our domestic\r\ntrade, although in some markets certain dealers split them. They are\r\nused successfully, however, for grinding purposes and to some extent for\r\nmaking the small loaf cheese which has come into prominence the past\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nRetail distribution of cheese received an impetus during the week on\r\naccount of the especially low retail prices advertised by large\r\nretailers, principally chain-store operators, in several eastern cities.\r\nPrices were reported as having been as low as 21¢ for cheese of good\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n=IMPORTS OF WOOL DURING AUGUST.=\r\n\r\n  ---------------+---------+--------+-------------------+----------\r\n                 | Class 1.|Class 2.|     Class 3.      |\r\n                 | Washed  |Hair of +----------+--------+\r\n  Imported from--|  and    |Angora  |  Washed  |        |   Total.\r\n                 |unwashed.|goat and|   and    |Scoured.|\r\n                 |         |alpaca. | unwashed.|        |\r\n  ---------------+---------+--------+----------+--------+------------\r\n                 | _Lbs._  | _Lbs._ |  _Lbs._  | _Lbs._ |   _Lbs._\r\n  Belgium        |    ...  |   ...  |    71,827|  ...   |      71,827\r\n  Czechoslovakia |    ...  |   ...  |    39,401|  ...   |      39,401\r\n  France         |    ...  |   ...  |   244,723|  ...   |     244,723\r\n  Germany        |    ...  |   ...  |   138,245|  ...   |     138,245\r\n  Italy          |    ...  |   ...  |   438,731|  ...   |     438,731\r\n  Switzerland    |    ...  |   ...  |    65,264|  ...   |      65,264\r\n  England        |   10,700|   ...  | 2,411,684|  4,568 |   2,426,952\r\n  Scotland       |    ...  |   ...  |   866,950|  ...   |     866,950\r\n  Canada         |      844|   ...  |     ...  |  ...   |         844\r\n  Argentina      |3,180,672|   ...  |   421,529| 33,981 |[1]3,637,031\r\n  Peru           |    ...  |   4,689|     ...  |  ...   |       4,689\r\n  Uruguay        |  469,217|   ...  |     ...  |  ...   |     469,217\r\n  China          |   53,444|  26,026| 6,118,041|  ...   |   6,197,511\r\n  British India  |    ...  |   ...  |   451,018|  ...   |     451,018\r\n  Australia      |  184,441|   ...  |     ...  |  ...   |     184,441\r\n  New Zealand    |  268,175|   ...  |     ...  |  ...   |     268,175\r\n  British South  |         |        |          |        |\r\n  Africa         |   55,087|  44,344|     7,802| 51,727 |  [2]360,065\r\n  Other countries|      660|   ...  |     1,000|  ...   |       1,660\r\n                 +---------+--------+----------+--------+------------\r\n      Total      |4,223,240|  75,059|11,276,215| 90,276 |  15,866,744\r\n  ---------------+---------+--------+----------+--------+------------\r\n\r\n  [1] Includes 849 lbs. of scoured wool, class 1.\r\n\r\n  [2] Includes 201,105 lbs. of scoured wool, class 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grain and Seeds_\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEAT AND CORN FUTURES DROP STEADILY IN PRICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCash Premiums Strengthen in all Markets Except Minneapolis--Flour is\r\nImported.\r\n\r\nThe wheat market closed lower every day except two during the week\r\nending Monday, Oct. 3, and the net decline in the different markets was\r\n6¢ to 10¹⁄₂¢ for the December future and 5¢ to 8¹⁄₂¢ for the May future.\r\nCorn was influenced by wheat and followed the fluctuations of the\r\nlatter. The net loss in corn was 2¢ for the December future and 1¢ for\r\nthe May future. Corn touched the lowest prices for the crop on Oct. 3.\r\nThe September futures “went out” on the last day of September and except\r\nat Minneapolis, owing to local conditions in that market, at the low\r\npoint for most September futures since early in July.\r\n\r\nClosing prices of the September futures were: Chicago September wheat\r\n$1.16¹⁄₈, September corn 47¢; Minneapolis September wheat $1.41¹⁄₄;\r\nKansas City September wheat $1.10. At Minneapolis, September wheat\r\nclosed at 7¢ over December on the last day of September, owing to a\r\nstrong milling demand for choice wheat.\r\n\r\nThe declines recorded in the December futures in the different markets\r\nduring the week were: Chicago December wheat 6¹⁄₄¢ and December corn 2¢;\r\nMinneapolis December wheat 10¹⁄₂¢, Kansas City 6¢, and Winnipeg 8³⁄₄¢.\r\nThe May futures recorded the following declines: Chicago May wheat 5¢,\r\nMay corn 1¢; Minneapolis May wheat 8¢; Kansas City 5¹⁄₄¢; and Winnipeg\r\n8¹⁄₂¢.\r\n\r\nClosing prices on Oct. 3 were: Chicago December wheat $1.18³⁄₈, December\r\ncorn 49⁵⁄₈¢; Minneapolis December wheat $1.28¹⁄₂; Kansas City $1.10¹⁄₄;\r\nand Winnipeg $1.22¹⁄₄. The May futures closed as follows: Chicago May\r\nwheat $1.23³⁄₈, May corn 55¹⁄₄¢; Minneapolis May wheat $1.29¹⁄₂; Kansas\r\nCity $1.15; and Winnipeg $1.27.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOUR IMPORTS FROM CANADA.\r\n\r\nThere were several important developments in the general situation. One\r\nof these was a report from New York that 20,000 bbls. of Canadian flour\r\nhad been bought to come to that market. This, of course, had a\r\ndepressing influence on wheat prices. During August 3,700 bbls. of flour\r\nand 239,000 bus. of wheat were imported from Canada. This was for\r\ndomestic consumption and not for re-export at American ports. Another\r\nbearish development of the week was a report that Hard Winter wheat on\r\npassage for Europe had been sold at 11¢ under the price at which it\r\ncould be replaced. It was also reported that Hard Winter wheat was being\r\nresold in London at 5¢ under the replacement cost.\r\n\r\nAll of the news was not bearish, however. A message from the Pacific\r\ncoast early in the week reported that 12,000,000 to 15,000,000 bus. of\r\nPacific coast wheat were under contract for shipment to the Orient.\r\nAlso, on Oct. 3 a message reported an additional 1,250,000 bus. of wheat\r\nsold to Japan. The impression appears to be growing in the grain trade\r\nthat the United States has probably already sold for export all the\r\nwheat that can be spared and that there will be a scarcity later in the\r\nseason unless there are liberal importations from Canada.\r\n\r\nThere were some changes in the cash wheat markets. At Chicago a good\r\ndemand developed for No. 2 Red Winter and supplies of that kind of wheat\r\nwere scarce. The premium over the December strengthened and on Oct. 3\r\nwas 5¢ to 6¢. At the same time No. 2 Hard Winter sold at ¹⁄₄¢ to 1¢ over\r\nDecember. Receipts of wheat showed a decreasing tendency at Kansas City\r\nand the premium strengthened.

On Oct. 3, No. 1\r\nDark Northern sold at 10¢ to 18¢ over Minneapolis December and No. 2 at\r\n6¢ to 12¢ over. The weakness in the cash market at Minneapolis was\r\ncaused by a poor flour demand and increasing receipts of spring wheat.\r\nReports from Minneapolis for some time past have reflected a very poor\r\ndemand for flour.\r\n\r\nThe visible supply statement issued on Oct. 3 showed an increase of\r\n1,636,000 bus. of wheat for the week.

The old and new rates on\r\nwheat and corn per 100 lbs. from North Atlantic ports are as follows:\r\n\r\n--------------+---------+----------\r\n     To--     |Old rate.| New rate.\r\n--------------+---------+----------\r\n              |_Cents._ | _Cents._\r\nUnited Kingdom|   21    |    17\r\nAntwerp       |   22¹⁄₂ |    16¹⁄₂\r\nHamburg       |   22¹⁄₂ |    18\r\n--------------+---------+----------\r\n\r\nWheat flour, which takes a differential of 55¢ per 100 lbs., will be\r\nsubject to a corresponding reduction, making the new rates on flour per\r\n100 lbs. as follows: To the United Kingdom, 22¢; to Antwerp, 21¢; and to\r\nHamburg, 23¢.\r\n\r\n\r\nBulk of White Clover Seed Already Sold.\r\n\r\nGrowers in southern Wisconsin had disposed of 80% of their crop of white\r\nclover seed by the end of September. The prevailing prices ranging from\r\n$30 to $40 per 100 lbs. have been fairly satisfactory to growers. The\r\nquality of the seed varies in different localities but probably averages\r\nabout the same as or slightly inferior to that of last year because more\r\nof it is reported mixed with alsike and timothy.\r\n\r\nThe imports of white clover seed, principally from Germany, have tended\r\nto stabilize prices for the short crop of American seed. From July 1 to\r\nSept. 30 there was permitted entry 538,600 lbs. and none for the same\r\nperiod last year.\r\n\r\n\r\nTimothy Seed Exports to Europe.\r\n\r\nExports of timothy seed from New York during the two weeks ending Oct.\r\n1, were 550,000 lbs. to Great Britain, 75,000 lbs. to Denmark, 40,000\r\nlbs. to Germany, and 20,000 lbs. to Holland. Exports of Kentucky\r\nbluegrass from New York and Baltimore were 21,000 lbs. to Holland,\r\n28,000 lbs. to Great Britain, and 16,500 lbs. to Germany.\r\n\r\nThe arrivals of imported seed at New York and Baltimore during the same\r\nperiod were: Alfalfa, 425,000 lbs. from Argentina; red clover, 113,000\r\nlbs. from Germany, 92,000 lbs. from France, and 44,000 lbs. from Chile;\r\nwhite clover, 22,000 lbs. from Denmark and 11,000 lbs. from Holland;\r\ncrimson clover, 105,000 lbs. from Germany; orchard grass, 179,000 lbs.\r\nfrom Denmark, 121,000 lbs. from Germany, and 45,000 lbs. from Holland;\r\nsunflower, 560,000 lbs. and canary, 128,000 lbs. from Argentina; rape,\r\n187,000 lbs. from Holland and 44,000 lbs. from France; vetch, 57,000\r\nlbs. from Sweden and 11,600 lbs. from Germany; rye grass, 22,000 lbs.\r\nfrom Great Britain; and grass (kind not specified) 123,000 lbs. from\r\nArgentina.\r\n\r\n\r\nEgypt May Control Sowing of Cotton Seed.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Egypt is now considering a plan whereby it will assume\r\ncontrol over all cotton seed used for planting purposes to preserve the\r\nstandard varieties in a state of purity and to facilitate the\r\npropagation of new varieties under the most favorable conditions.\r\n\r\nThe history of the cotton industry in Egypt shows that a great number of\r\ncotton varieties have been planted which after a period of commercial\r\npopularity have almost disappeared from cultivation. Under the plan now\r\nbeing proposed no private person or firm will be permitted to engage in\r\nthe selection or production of new varieties or strains of cotton unless\r\nlicensed to do so, and even then not more than 200 acres may be devoted\r\nto the experiment. The area to be so planted must furthermore first\r\nundergo a field test for at least two years under the direction of the\r\nministry of agriculture.\r\n\r\nIf the experiment proves satisfactory the seed obtained from the new\r\nvariety or strain will be propagated and distributed by the Government\r\nunder the name registered by the original producer. The Government will\r\nallow the producer a royalty on all seed used or sold for planting\r\npurposes, but will reserve the right to limit the rate of, or to\r\ndiscontinue entirely, its propagation.\r\n\r\nFurther information on this proposed control plan may be obtained upon\r\nrequest to the Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=The economic importance of seeds= is perhaps greater than that of any\r\nother farm commodity. Seeds are potential plants. Practically all staple\r\nfoods are derived, either directly or indirectly, from plants. A\r\nshortage of seed in any country or section of a country may mean a\r\nshortage of food. The commercial supply of seeds in the United States\r\nsafeguards every section of this country against a deficiency in the\r\nnecessary requirements for planting annually and indirectly helps to\r\nmaintain the stocks of food at uniform levels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=The best commercial grades= of red clover, alfalfa, and timothy seed\r\ntest 99.5% or better in purity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hay and Feed_\r\n\r\n\r\nHAY PRICES REGISTER ADVANCE IN NEW YORK MARKET.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrices in Most Markets Unchanged Under Continued Light Receipts--Demand\r\nfor Top Grades Only.\r\n\r\nA continued light movement of hay to market prevailed during the week\r\nending Oct. 1 and with the exception of one or two markets prices were\r\nbut little changed from the preceding week.\r\n\r\nThe average price of No. 1 timothy at the principal timothy markets is\r\nnow about $23.50 per ton, with the alfalfa average price about $22.75.\r\nThis is $10 less per ton for both kinds than the prevailing average\r\nprice Oct. 1, 1920. There is a fair local demand in limited quantities\r\nfor the better grades of hay but scarcely any shipping demand and the\r\nlower grades are neglected. Good pastures and large local supplies of\r\nforage are important factors and will probably curtail demand for some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nReceipts at nine of the important hay markets were practically the same\r\nas for the preceding week and totaled only a little over 1,000 cars\r\ncompared with over 2,000 cars in the same markets at the corresponding\r\ntime last year. The following table gives receipts of hay in several\r\nimportant markets for the weeks ending Sept. 24 and Oct. 1, 1921, and\r\nOct. 2, 1920.\r\n\r\n  --------------------+------------------+--------\r\n                      |     1921         |  1920\r\n    Cities.           +------------------+--------\r\n                      |Oct. 1.| Sept. 24.| Oct. 2.\r\n  --------------------+-------+----------+--------\r\n  New York            |    73 |     164  |    359\r\n  Pittsburgh          |    50 |      55  |    186\r\n  Cincinnati          |    93 |      66  |    219\r\n  Chicago             |   184 |     195  |    207\r\n  Minneapolis-St. Paul|    67 |      36  |     18\r\n  St. Louis           |   152 |     105  |    215\r\n  Kansas City         |   189 |     139  |  1,019\r\n  San Francisco       |    78 |     107  |   ...\r\n  Los Angeles         |   144 |     150  |     78\r\n  --------------------+-------+----------+--------\r\n\r\n\r\nTIMOTHY UP $4 AT NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n_Timothy._--Very light receipts of timothy at New York and efforts on\r\nthe part of dealers to replenish their light stocks from the small\r\nquantity of hay arriving caused prices to advance $4 per ton during the\r\nweek in that market. Buying was restricted, however, by the higher\r\nprices. Other eastern markets were practically unchanged. Good hay is\r\nscarce but equal to the light demand.\r\n\r\nPrices at both the Pittsburgh and Cincinnati markets advanced $1 during\r\nthe week, but the advance at Cincinnati was lost on Saturday because of\r\na lack of support from shippers. Light receipts were almost entirely\r\nresponsible for the firm market tone both at Chicago and St. Louis, as\r\nthe demand was not large and was confined principally to local needs. At\r\nChicago cars of choice hay in small bales sold at premiums of $1 to $2\r\nover current quotations. Receipts on the North side increased and those\r\non the South side decreased, so that the premium at which hay sold on\r\nthe North side tracks last week was reduced about $1 per ton.\r\n\r\nThere was very little activity in the southern markets during the week.\r\nStocks are light, but buying is only for the light local demand.\r\nRichmond reports a good demand for No. 1 clover hay, of which very\r\nlittle is being offered.\r\n\r\n_Alfalfa._--The alfalfa market showed some advances during the week, but\r\nprices were not materially higher. A better demand from southern and\r\nsoutheastern consuming sections and from interior Kansas points, where\r\nsupplies are relatively small, was reported at Kansas City. Los Angeles\r\nalso reports an increased demand for good grades. Choice dairy and\r\nrabbit hay is selling at a good premium over No. 1 and standard alfalfa.\r\nA sharp demand for fertilizer alfalfa is also reported from southern\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nFurther shipments of alfalfa from San Francisco to the New England\r\nStates were made during the week, but local demand in that market is\r\nvery light. The movement of alfalfa in other Western States is light,\r\ncaused principally by the light feeding demand and high freight rates.\r\n\r\n_Prairie._--More favorable weather has resulted in larger receipts of\r\nprairie hay at Minneapolis. The market remained steady, however, because\r\nof buying by the local stockyard. Firm prices on timothy and light\r\nreceipts of prairie totaling only six cars for the week caused a firm\r\nmarket at Chicago also. The light receipts were attributed to the low\r\nprices which prevailed a short time ago. Increased receipts at Kansas\r\nCity, caused apparently by the recent high prices, are more than equal\r\nto the limited demand and the market for prairie is weak with prices\r\nsomewhat lower than last week. There was a good local demand from the\r\nstockyards, but practically no shipping demand, which is required to\r\nabsorb any materially increased receipts. But little change is expected\r\nuntil colder weather arrives.\r\n\r\n_Straw._--Light receipts of straw caused slight price advances in\r\nseveral markets. Demand is light, however, and would not absorb a large\r\nincrease in receipts except at price concessions. The following\r\nquotations represent current prices: No. 1 wheat straw--Philadelphia\r\n$12, Pittsburgh $11.50, Richmond $13, Cincinnati $9, Chicago $11.50,\r\nMinneapolis and Kansas City $8; No. 1 oat straw--Philadelphia and\r\nPittsburgh $12, Cincinnati $11, Chicago $12.50, Minneapolis $9, Kansas\r\nCity $8; No. 1 rye straw (straight)--New York $22.50, Philadelphia $20;\r\n(tangled) Pittsburgh $12.50, Chicago $13.50, Cincinnati and Minneapolis\r\n$9.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEAT MILL FEED MARKET SHOWS VERY WEAK CONDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Inactivity in Feed Market Continues--Offerings of Cottonseed\r\nMeal Increasing.\r\n\r\nThe feed market throughout the country was very dull and weak for the\r\nweek ending Oct. 1. There was practically no investment buying of any\r\ncommodity and dealers were supplying their immediate needs only. Prices\r\ngenerally are weak and in some markets lower on several feeds.\r\n\r\nProduction of wheat and corn feeds remains fairly heavy. Cotton seed in\r\nsome sections is moving more freely and meal mills are expected to\r\nincrease their offerings. Feed shipments from Minneapolis mills were\r\nheavy and stocks in public warehouses at lake ports are increasing.\r\nApproximately 28,750 tons of wheat feeds were reported in these\r\nwarehouses at the end of the week under review, compared with about\r\n2,200 tons at the corresponding time last year.\r\n\r\n_Wheat mill feeds._--Continued heavy production of bran and middlings,\r\ntogether with a lack of sufficient demand to absorb the offerings,\r\nresulted in a very weak feed market during the week. The lower grain\r\nprices were also a bearish factor. Bran was especially dull. Both mills\r\nand jobbers were pressing sales in some markets. Some distress bran was\r\nin evidence at both Chicago and Cincinnati. Hard winter bran sold as low\r\nas $10 per ton on track at Kansas City.\r\n\r\n=CARLOAD PRICES OF HAY AND FEED AT IMPORTANT MARKETS, OCT. 1.=\r\n\r\n[In dollars per ton.]\r\n\r\n

Rolled.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDDLINGS ACTIVE.\r\n\r\nMiddlings were more active than bran and in several western markets,\r\nincluding Kansas City and St. Louis, there was a good demand for\r\nmiddlings and shorts from both local buyers and shippers. The shipping\r\ndemand was rather broad, mostly in single car orders, from the Central\r\nWest, South, and Southeast. The higher prices asked for middlings in the\r\nsouthern markets, however, are causing consumers to buy bran instead.\r\nAlthough prices are low some dealers are inclined to think that still\r\nlower prices will prevail if an attempt is made to market the feed\r\nstored at lake ports before navigation closes. However, Minneapolis\r\nmills are holding firm at present quotations.\r\n\r\n_Cottonseed meal._--The cottonseed meal market has lost much of the\r\nstrength displayed during the past few weeks. New seed is now moving to\r\nmills in larger quantities and the available supply of meal is\r\nincreasing. There is practically no consumptive demand and dealers are\r\ntherefore holding off buying as they expect lower prices. Offerings from\r\nmills are still limited and in some sections only for October delivery.\r\nLack of demand rather than heavy offerings is probably the cause of the\r\npresent weakness in meal prices. Some exports of meal are reported at\r\nNew Orleans. The demand for meal for fertilizer purposes is light\r\nbecause other ammoniates are cheaper at the present time.\r\n\r\n_Linseed meal._--Northwestern linseed meal mills reduced their prices\r\nsomewhat during the week, but the decline was not reflected in all the\r\nmarkets. Philadelphia reports a slight advance in prices, but quotations\r\nat Buffalo and Chicago were lower. Stocks are rather heavy and jobbers\r\nare pressing sales. There is only a very light demand and resellers are\r\noffering meal at $2 to $3 under mill prices in an effort to stimulate\r\nsales.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLUTEN FEED DEMAND DULL.\r\n\r\n_Gluten feed._--No further reductions in the price of gluten feed were\r\nreported during the week, but the demand was very dull and very little\r\ninterest was shown by buyers. Large Chicago manufacturers reported a\r\nslight increase in buying orders toward the last of the week. Buffalo\r\nreported a light demand, but mills are not pressing sales as they were a\r\nfew days ago.\r\n\r\n_Hominy feed._--Lower corn prices were reflected in the hominy feed\r\nmarket. Prices declined 50¢ to $1 in several markets and mills were\r\nurgent sellers. The demand for all other feeds is very light so that a\r\nsurplus in the offerings, especially of yellow hominy feed, is\r\nnoticeable.\r\n\r\n_Alfalfa meal._--Alfalfa meal at Kansas City was weak and lower, No. 1\r\nmeal being offered as low as $17.20 per ton and No. 2 at $14. The demand\r\nfrom both feeders and feed manufacturers is light. But little\r\nimprovement in the market for this feed can be expected until some\r\nactivity appears in the demand for other feeds.\r\n\r\n_Peanut meal._--No offerings of new crop peanut meal have been reported,\r\nand it is stated that probably none will be offered until about Nov.\r\n1.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMAND FOR CUT HAY ALMOST A THING OF THE PAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Use of Automobiles and Electric Street Cars Cuts Sales--Was Used\r\nMostly in Cities.\r\n\r\nThe demand for cut, or chopped, hay has diminished to such an extent\r\nduring the past decade that at present only an occasional car is bought\r\nby city dealers while only a few shippers prepare this commodity for\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nBut back in the days when phaetons, surreys, and smart traps drawn by\r\nhigh-stepping trotters and easy-going “family” horses were seen upon the\r\nboulevards, and the heavy hauling was done by big draft horses rather\r\nthan by gasoline-eating trucks, many city dealers operated plants for\r\nthe preparation and baling of cut hay. Numerous plants also were\r\nsituated in the producing sections of New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.\r\nThe advent of the automobile, however, has changed all this, aided\r\nmaterially by the substitution of electricity for mule power as the\r\npropelling force of street cars.\r\n\r\nThe kinds of hay usually chopped were timothy and clover mixed. While\r\nhay which had become slightly overripe or which contained a mixture of\r\ngrasses frequently was used, only good, sound, and sweet feeding hay was\r\nconsidered fit for shipping.\r\n\r\n\r\nFED MIXED WITH GRAIN.\r\n\r\nCut hay is generally fed mixed with grain and is considered an excellent\r\nfeed, as it prevents the stock from eating the concentrated grain ration\r\ntoo rapidly. The hay is usually dampened when used in this manner. This\r\nis one of the disadvantages of feeding it for if more than enough is\r\nmixed for one feed and it is not fed within a short time it is likely to\r\nsour if the weather is warm, or possibly freeze if the weather is cold.\r\nThis condition, together with the labor and bother of mixing, has caused\r\nfeeders in many instances to turn to ready-mixed and molasses feeds.\r\n\r\nHowever, for feeders who desire to prepare their own mixed feed ration\r\nthe cut hay is probably the most convenient ingredient that can be used\r\nto produce the required bulk.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTS OF FORAGE-PLANT SEEDS.\r\n\r\n=The Seed Laboratory of the Bureau of Plant Industry reports the\r\nfollowing imports of forage-plant seeds permitted entry into the United\r\nStates under the seed importation Act.=\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+-------------------+---------+----------\r\n                           |     September--   | July 1- |  July 1-\r\n        Kind of seed.      +---------+---------+Sept. 30,| Sept. 30,\r\n                           |   1921  |   1920  |   1921  |    1920\r\n  -------------------------+---------+---------+---------+----------\r\n                           |_Pounds._|_Pounds._|_Pounds._| _Pounds._\r\n  Alfalfa                  | 422,200 |  44,100 |1,364,000|  171,500\r\n  Canada bluegrass         |   5,200 |   ...   |    7,400|    ...\r\n  Alsike clover            | 671,400 |  87,000 |1,106,700|  109,700\r\n  Crimson clover           | 879,500 | 998,100 |1,581,600|1,958,800\r\n  Red clover               | 116,400 |   6,800 |1,792,900|  305,200\r\n  White clover             | 263,600 |   ...   |  538,600|    ...\r\n  White and alsike clover  |         |         |         |\r\n  mixtures                 |   2,700 |   ...   |    8,100|    ...\r\n  Red and alsike clover    |         |         |         |\r\n  mixtures                 |   2,100 |   ...   |    2,100|    ...\r\n  Alsike clover and timothy|         |         |         |\r\n  mixtures                 |     500 |   ...   |    1,100|    ...\r\n  Broom-corn millet        |   ...   |   ...   |    ...  |    1,100\r\n  Foxtail millet           |   ...   |  14,700 |    ...  |   14,700\r\n  Grass mixtures           |   ...   |   ...   |   40,100|    ...\r\n  Orchard grass            | 833,300 |   ...   |  959,100|    ...\r\n  Rape                     | 554,100 | 170,900 |  728,700|  215,700\r\n  English rye grass        |   ...   |  15,600 |   16,300|  130,800\r\n  Italian rye grass        |   ...   |  49,800 |   13,800|  131,300\r\n  Timothy                  |   ...   |   ...   |   95,100|    ...\r\n  Hairy vetch              | 280,600 |  33,000 |  645,900|  367,700\r\n  Spring vetch             |   ...   |   ...   |    8,800|    ...\r\n  -------------------------+---------+---------+---------+----------\r\n\r\n=The cleaning=, if any, that the average farmer gives his seed merely\r\nremoves dirt, chaff, and weed and other foreign seeds that are much\r\nlarger or smaller or much heavier or lighter than the kind of seed that\r\nis being cleaned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cotton_\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICES OF SPOTS AND FUTURES CONTINUE TO ADVANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCondition of Crop Poorest on Record--Production Estimated at Only\r\n6,537,000 Bales.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the main feature in the cotton markets for the week ending Oct.\r\n1 was the sensational advance in prices which occurred on Sept. 27. That\r\nday was the first day for the issuance of notices of deliveries to be\r\nmade on October future contracts at the two future exchanges and it is\r\nreported that the notices issued were for more than 80,000 bales at New\r\nYork and over 20,000 bales at New Orleans. However, in spite of these\r\nnotices of heavy deliveries, the demand for October contracts during the\r\nday was such that the price at New York rose 1³⁄₄¢ per lb. and at New\r\nOrleans nearly 1¹⁄₂¢ over the low point reached early in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe closing prices for October future contracts for that day were 21.03¢\r\nat New York and 20.70¢ at New Orleans, or 143 points and 135 points,\r\nrespectively, above the closing prices of the previous Saturday. The\r\naverage price of middling in the 10 designated markets reached 20.89¢\r\nper lb. on Sept. 27, or very nearly $5 per bale higher than at the close\r\nof the previous week.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRADE APPREHENSIVE.\r\n\r\nOnly the better grades of cotton are deliverable on future contracts so\r\nthat probably one of the main causes of the keen demand for October\r\ncontracts was the apprehension that the present crop will not only be\r\nthe smallest for many years but that it will also be of low grade, as is\r\nindicated by reports from some sections.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the week prices eased off somewhat under heavy\r\nhedge selling and liquidation by long interests, but indications were\r\nthat the demand for future contracts, as well as for spot cotton during\r\nthe entire week, was fully equal to the offerings. The end of the week\r\nfound prices higher than those prevailing at the close of the previous\r\nweek except for the prices for the more distant months, which were a few\r\npoints lower.\r\n\r\nThe average price of Middling as determined from the quotations of the\r\n10 designated spot markets closed at 20.71¢ per lb. on Oct. 1, compared\r\nwith 19.92¢ at the close of the previous week and 23.11¢ for the\r\ncorresponding day in 1920.\r\n\r\nFluctuations in prices for futures ranged from a decline of 27 points\r\nfor July future contracts at New York to an advance of 88 points for\r\nOctober futures in the same market. October futures on the New Orleans\r\nCotton Exchange advanced 70 points. October future contracts on the\r\nLiverpool Cotton Association closed at 14.68d. per lb. on Sept. 30,\r\ncompared with 14.16d. at the close of the previous week and 17.23d. for\r\nthe corresponding day in 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPOT SALES LARGER.\r\n\r\nSpot sales during the week at the 10 designated markets were much larger\r\nthan they have been for any week this season. They amounted to 209,938\r\nbales, compared with 155,954 the previous week and 96,095 bales for the\r\ncorresponding week in 1920. On Sept. 28 the sales in the 10 markets were\r\n59,929 bales, the largest single day’s sales for this season.

Spain’s 1921\r\ncrop of Jordan almonds, which are grown only in the Provinces of Malaga,\r\nJaen, Granada, and Almeria, will be about equal to last year’s\r\nproduction, reports the American consul at Malaga. Various exporters\r\nplace the crop from 70,000 to 75,000 boxes of 25 lbs. each.\r\n\r\nThe crop is somewhat delayed because of the late spring, but the quality\r\nis good. Since all stocks of this variety have been exhausted for some\r\ntime, the demand is active, and opening prices f. o. b. Malaga are\r\nexpected to be considerably higher than last year. However, this should\r\nmake but little difference to the buyers in the United States, as they\r\nwill benefit by the decrease in the exchange value of the peseta.\r\n\r\nThe general opinion seems to be that this year’s crop of Valencia\r\nalmonds will exceed last year’s production by 15% to 20%. Inasmuch as\r\nthese almonds are grown in various parts of Spain and often shipped to\r\nMalaga for export, it is difficult to give exact figures. Prices of\r\nValencia almonds are regulated by quotations from Italy, but Spanish\r\nfarmers in the Malaga district are expecting good prices on account of\r\nthe small stocks carried over.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the total exports of shelled almonds from\r\nMalaga, Spain, to all countries and to the United States during the past\r\nfive years:\r\n\r\n  -----+---------+-------------\r\n       |  Total  | Exports to\r\n  Year.| exports.|the United\r\n       |         |   States.\r\n  -----+---------+-------------\r\n       |_Pounds._|  _Pounds._\r\n  1916 |4,548,090|  2,873,356\r\n  1917 |2,469,152|  2,183,659\r\n  1918 |4,664,934|  2,882,597\r\n  1919 |6,673,324|  3,821,341\r\n  1920 |2,521,078|  5,028,693\r\n  -----+---------+---------------\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON : GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE : 1921\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n  Inconsistent spelling, hyphenation and formatting have been retained,\r\n  except as mentioned below.\r\n\r\n  Article Fruits and Vegetables, section Onions, ... in Pittsburgh,\r\n  clos- $3.75 to $4: as printed in the source document; some text is\r\n  obviously missing.\r\n\r\n  Article Grain and Seeds, section FLOUR EXPORTS FROM CANADA, The\r\n  premium over the December strengthened: as printed in the source\r\n  document; some text is missing.\r\n\r\n  The wide tables are viewed best in a wide browser window.\r\n\r\n  Changes made:\r\n\r\n  Articles that were printed in multiple parts throughout the source\r\n  document have been re-combined.
