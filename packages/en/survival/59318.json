The citizens of the West have\r\nbeen forced to carry on campaigns for the control of these rodents\r\nsince the settlers first staked out claims on the prairies. To the\r\nagricultural interests of the West the control of rodents is as vital\r\nas is the proper spraying of trees throughout the East to prevent\r\ndamage by insects. These small mammals cover the western ranges by\r\ncountless thousands, and control is necessary if crops are to be grown.\r\n\r\nRodent control is nothing new. Records indicate that as early as 1808,\r\nstrychnine was shipped by boat around Cape Horn to the Santa Barbara\r\nMission, Calif., in order that the early settlers might kill off the\r\nground squirrels. A constant fight has been waged ever, since, but\r\nunfortunately, while the landowners were willing to finance the killing\r\nof squirrels on their own holdings, the Federal Government provided\r\ninadequate funds to take care of the vast areas of public domain,\r\nnational forests, Indian reservations, and other Federal holdings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFederal, State, and Local Cooperation\r\n\r\nWhen the Emergency Conservation Work Program came into being,\r\nthe Forest Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Bureau of\r\nReclamation, the Division of Grazing, and the Bureau of Biological\r\nSurvey took the opportunity to treat a vast acreage that would have\r\nbeen treated years ago had funds permitted. During the three fiscal\r\nyears 1934 to 1936 a total of almost 20,000,000 acres had been covered\r\nby E.C.W. for the control of these various rodent pests. On the statute\r\nbooks of several Western States rodent-control laws provide that\r\nlandowners may establish rodent-control districts wherein all lands\r\nare treated simultaneously by paid crews working under the supervision\r\nof the Biological Survey. Never before the E.C.W. program were there\r\nadequate Federal funds to make these laws effective by taking proper\r\ncare of infested public lands adjacent to private holdings.\r\n\r\nThe most concrete proof of the necessity of rodent control is found\r\nin the amount of money expended by private individuals throughout the\r\nWest for this purpose. The Federal Government, while owning as much\r\nas 60 percent of the land in many of the Western States, contributes\r\nonly about 25 percent of the total cost of rodent-control operations.\r\nDuring the fiscal year 1936, States, counties, and private individuals\r\nexpended $665,785 for the purpose, while the Biological Survey was able\r\nto expend only $226,623 from regular appropriations. The E.C.W. program\r\nafforded the first opportunity of somewhere near meeting the Federal\r\nGovernment's obligations to the citizens of the West in the matter of\r\nadequately controlling the rodent pests that breed and range on public\r\nlands and from these strongholds infest and reinfest adjacent private\r\nholdings.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining of E.C.W. Crews\r\n\r\nRodent control is one of the most popular projects with E.C.W.\r\nenrollees themselves as well as with the local people benefited. In\r\nmany cases, crew foremen supplied by the Survey took boys who would not\r\nwork satisfactorily on any other type of project and made real hands of\r\nthem on rodent-control crews. The boys liked to work in these crews, as\r\nit afforded them opportunity to become acquainted not only with methods\r\nof rodent control but with the various habits of wildlife as well.\r\n\r\nIn order to employ proper methods and place all possible safeguards\r\naround poisoning operations for the protection of beneficial and\r\nharmless species, the Biological Survey has insisted upon approving the\r\nappointments of all men employed on the supervision of rodent-control\r\nwork for its various cooperating agencies. This is for the reason that\r\nwhen poisoning campaigns are properly handled and carefully supervised,\r\nthere is little danger of the accidental poisoning of other animals.\r\nThe records indicate that there have been practically no cases of\r\ndestruction of other forms of life through the E.C.W. rodent-control\r\nprogram. Naturally, the supervisors not only must know rodent control\r\nbut also must be acquainted with the habits and status of wildlife in\r\ngeneral, and in handling the crews they have imparted knowledge to the\r\nbeys that will be of permanent benefit to them and to the Nation.\r\n\r\nEducational programs were provided as regularly as possible, in\r\norder to tell the C.C.C. enrollees of various wildlife problems. The\r\nentire personnel of E.C.W. camps were shown films depicting the work\r\nof beavers, showing measures for the protection of elk, deer, and\r\nother big-game animals, and portraying the need of sane, sensible\r\nconservation methods, in order that the remnants of our fast-vanishing\r\nforms of valuable wildlife might be preserved. Mimeographed leaflets\r\non wildlife management studies were made up by district agents of\r\nthe Survey for the boys in order that they might be given as broad\r\ninstructions as possible in the protection and preservation of species\r\nthat are an asset rather than a liability to man's interest. It has\r\nbeen the attempt of the Biological Survey to make the rodent-control\r\nproject a field laboratory for the education of the enrollees in\r\nnatural history and wildlife management, and the popularity of the\r\nproject among the boys attests to the wisdom of this course. In many\r\ncamps more applications for places on rodent-control crews were\r\nreceived than there were places to fill.\r\n\r\n\r\nTimeliness of Emergency Aid\r\n\r\nFortunately, the E.C.W. program came at the most opportune time. The\r\nextreme drought throughout the west had forced rodents from the open\r\nlands into adjacent irrigated valleys and mountain meadows, where they\r\nbecame especially objectionable in their competition with livestock\r\nfor the available forage. Livestock and rodents together, during dry\r\nperiods, have in many places almost entirely denuded the surface soil\r\nof its vegetation. This has caused the beginning of sheet erosion in\r\nareas where there would still be ample forage for livestock had it not\r\nbeen for the excessive numbers of rodents. On many areas, grazing by\r\nlivestock and rodents combined has practically eliminated the native\r\ngrasses, and these are now being replaced with weeds and poisonous\r\nplants. Damage in some instances has amounted to at least 75 percent\r\nof the available forage, and the average loss has probably been\r\napproximately 25 percent.\r\n\r\nOn some of the Indian reservations of the Southwest, the condition has\r\nbeen pitiful. On the Navajo Reservation, in particular, the Indians\r\nhave carried on a losing fight against drought and rodents. It has\r\noften been necessary for them to replant their corn three and four\r\ntimes a season, since kangaroo rats and other native rodents dig up the\r\nkernels as rapidly as they are planted. Prior to the spring of 1936,\r\nthere had been four years of drought, and this, coupled with rodent\r\ndamage, had reduced corn production to the point where the Indians had\r\nbarely enough for the spring seeding. All were clamoring for aid, and\r\nin order to save their last crop of corn it was necessary to detail a\r\nforeman with four or five E.C.W. Indians to go from farm to farm and\r\nconduct rodent-control operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nForest and Forage Protection\r\n\r\nThe Forest Service is endeavoring to carry on a reforestation program\r\nthroughout much of the cut-over area in the Lake States and the Pacific\r\nNorthwest. One of the chief problems to successful reforestation\r\nis the control of rodents, particularly the snowshoe hare. In the\r\nOlympic Forest in Washington, the snowshoe hare has destroyed as much\r\nas 40 percent and damaged 70 percent of the Douglas fir seedlings.\r\nIn Michigan and Wisconsin, it was necessary to carry on extensive\r\nrodent-control operations to permit the seedlings to survive. Much of\r\nthis work would never have been possible but for E.C.W. help.\r\n\r\nIn the open area, jack rabbits have become a serious pest. The\r\nBiological Survey, in 1934, received a petition bearing the signatures\r\nof more than 8,000 individuals of eastern Colorado, requesting\r\nGovernment aid in killing jack rabbits, which were ravaging the meager\r\nstocks of forage left after drought and wind had taken their toll.\r\n\r\nThe Forest Service recognized that rodent control would be essential\r\nif the Plains Shelterbelt program of planting trees from the Canadian\r\nborder to Texas was to be effective, and in 1935 approximately\r\none-tenth of its entire appropriation for the program was expended for\r\nrodent control under the supervision of the Biological Survey. Crews\r\npatrolled the planted areas constantly to prevent the gnawing of the\r\nseedlings by jack rabbits and pocket gophers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAid in Erosion Control\r\n\r\nThe permanent benefits accruing from the E.C.W. rodent-control program\r\nhave been enormous from the standpoint of erosion control alone. An\r\nassociate range examiner of the Forest Service has the following to say\r\nregarding the effect of rodents on erosion in the Boise watershed of\r\nIdaho:\r\n\r\n  \"Rodents, numerous and spreading over nearly 80 percent of the Boise\r\n  watershed, have undoubtedly been responsible for no small part of\r\n  the present erosion. Wholly dependent upon the herbaceous plants for\r\n  their food supply, their tremendous numbers, along with over-grazing\r\n  by livestock and unfavorable climate, have been an important\r\n  contributing factor in depleting this cover, and thus have greatly\r\n  reduced the protection afforded the soil and subjected it the more to\r\n  increased sheet erosion. Even light rains on rodent-infested areas\r\n  are likely to start cutting, which may develop into destructive gully\r\n  erosion because of the almost immediate accumulation of run-offs in\r\n  the myriads of burrows and channels which these animals construct\r\n  just under the surface of the soil.\"\r\n\r\nThe control of rodents is vital to the successful operation of\r\nreclamation projects in the western third of the United States.\r\nRodents, particularly pocket gophers, find the banks of irrigation\r\ncanals an ideal location for their burrows and runways. These\r\nsubterranean passageways frequently are the cause of serious breaks\r\nin canals, through which the flow of irrigation water is diverted\r\nand wasted to flood adjacent lands, destroying valuable crops, and\r\nindirectly ruining others by causing delays in delivery of water.\r\nThrough the E.C.W. program, C.C.C. crews working under the direction\r\nof experienced foremen trained by the Biological Survey have greatly\r\nreduced this menace. In the past year alone half a million acres of\r\ncanal banks and contiguous lands were treated by C.C.C. rodent-control\r\ncrews with a thoroughness that will be of lasting benefit to the\r\nnation's reclamation projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples of Benefits Derived\r\n\r\nA few concrete examples will illustrate the great good that has\r\nresulted from the E.C.W. rodent-control program. A group of farmers\r\nliving at Springfield, Idaho, suggested to the camp superintendent\r\nthere that the jack rabbit control work done by the E.C.W. crew during\r\nthe summer of 1935 might pay the cost of the camp. It is estimated that\r\nnot less than 600,000 rabbits were killed by this crew on public lands\r\nadjacent to farming areas between American Falls and Moreland, Idaho.\r\nThe work afforded protection to not less than half a million dollars\r\nworth of cultivated crops and to more than 75,000 acres of grazing\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nThe control work carried on by an E.C.W. crew near Weber Lake, Calif.,\r\nin 1933 has been responsible for a 50 percent comeback of the grass\r\non a large mountain meadow, which had been made a dust heap because\r\nof pocket gopher workings. The pocket gophers had honeycombed the\r\nsurface of the ground, and sheep had trampled out most of the grass,\r\nwhile livestock grazing had been reduced to a negligible figure. The\r\nrestoration in two years was due primarily to the elimination of the\r\npocket gophers.\r\n\r\nTo control prairie dogs in Oklahoma, an area, of 47,000 acres in\r\nPawnee, Noble, and Kay Counties was treated through the medium of the\r\nE.C.W. The Indian lands here are interspersed with private lands, and\r\nthe landowners were unable to make any progress in a general clean up\r\nbecause there were insufficient Federal funds to treat the Indian lands\r\nuntil the E.C.W. project afforded opportunity to carry on a systematic\r\ncampaign over the entire area. A good piece of work was accomplished,\r\nand this, in conjunction with water developments, made the grass so\r\nmuch better over these old prairie dog towns in the spring of 1935 that\r\nthe Indian Service officials at Pawnee received an increased rental of\r\n25 cents an acre on their grazing lands. On areas where they received\r\n50 cents an acre in 1934, they received 75 cents in 1935, a direct\r\nincrease in receipts to the Federal Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe permanent benefit accruing to the Indians from E.C.W. rodent\r\ncontrol is summed up as follows by an Agricultural Extension agent of\r\nthe Indian Service, at Anadarko, Oklahoma:\r\n\r\n  \"No little stress can be placed upon the financial value of the\r\n  rodent-control project to the Indians. The Indian enrollees received\r\n  the labor benefit on both Indian and deeded land throughout the\r\n  reservation but still greater than the temporary labor relief, the\r\n  Indian has received a lasting increase in the financial rental of his\r\n  land. Due to such heavy prairie dog infestation of the allotted land\r\n  it had become necessary to reduce the rental value of the grass land\r\n  infested. Now that the prairie dogs have been controlled the rental\r\n  value will be increased by approximately 10 cents or more per acre\r\n  because the pastures will regrass and the carrying capacity will be\r\n  increased. In comparing this increase in rental value with the cost\r\n  of controlling the prairie dogs, the Indians will reap the financial\r\n  benefit of the Government expenditures in two or three years.\r\n  Therefore, this project has certainly been of utmost value to the\r\n  reservation and the Extension Division in helping the Indian to help\r\n  himself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSafeguarding Harmless Species\r\n\r\nSome persons uninformed as to the need for rodent control and the\r\nmethods followed by the Biological Survey in carrying on the work have\r\nstated that control by use of poison and C.C.C. workers endangers the\r\nexistence of other forms of wildlife. This, however, is not the case.\r\nThe Biological Survey has studied rodent-control methods for more than\r\ntwenty years and in this period it has developed the most scientific\r\nand selective poisons possible. Scientific investigations conducted\r\nby the Bureau are bringing increasing knowledge of the habits of\r\neconomically injurious species and of their physiological reaction to\r\nvarious baits. This has made it possible to use more and more specific\r\ncontrol methods and so to select, prepare, and expose poison baits as\r\nnot seriously to endanger animals other than those for which the baits\r\nare intended. When these scientific methods are carried out under\r\ndirect supervision of trained personnel, the total number of beneficial\r\nspecies destroyed is negligible.\r\n\r\nThe Biological Survey is a conservation organization and will undertake\r\nno work that will be detrimental to any species of animal not\r\ninterfering too greatly with the interests of man. Those conversant\r\nwith actual conditions in the range States realize that if agriculture\r\nis to survive, the control of injurious rodents is as essential as\r\nis control of the corn borer, the chinch bug, the boll weevil, the\r\ngrasshopper, the coddling moth, and numerous other agricultural\r\npests. The Survey insists that in conducting work of this sort, the\r\nmost careful supervision by trained technicians must be given. All\r\ncooperating agencies recognize the necessity for such supervision, and\r\nas a result a most worth-while program has been carried on during the\r\npast three fiscal years. The Biological Survey has entered into written\r\ncooperative understandings with the various governmental agencies under\r\nwhich rodent-control activities have been conducted. These agreements\r\nplace the responsibility for technically supervising all rodent-control\r\nactivities in the hands of the Bureau, leaving the cooperating agencies\r\nresponsible for administration.\r\n\r\n\r\nControl Work Illustrated\r\n\r\nThe illustrations on the following pages tell better than would volumes\r\nof written words, the story of rodent damage and of cooperative work to\r\nreduce this damage.\r\n\r\nPRAIRIE DOGS\r\n\r\nFour years experimental study in northern Arizona showed that prairie\r\ndogs destroy 60 percent of the wheat grass, 99 percent of the dropseed,\r\nand 83 percent of the grama grass, or 80 percent of the total potential\r\nannual production of forage. The possible destruction of four-fifths of\r\nthe forage, or even a far smaller proportion, is serious enough at any\r\ntime, but in periods of drought it is likely to be calamitous.\r\n\r\nThe following pictures show typical prairie dog infestation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPrairie dog mounds on abandoned Indian farm, Southern Navajo\r\nReservation, Arizona.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nArea practically denuded of grass by prairie dog--Wescalero Indian\r\nReservation, New Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDogs on leash and tin cans rattling in the wind are some of the\r\nprimitive methods employed by Indians in futile attempt to save crops\r\nfrom ravages of prairie dogs in the Southwest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIndian cornfield totally destroyed by prairie dogs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCotton and corn fields damaged by prairie dogs in northwest Texas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSide of basin denuded by prairie dogs--devastation being rapidly\r\ncompleted by erosion.

In\r\nmany areas the snowshoe hare will eat off as many as 40 percent of the\r\nseedlings and damage up to 70 percent of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rabbit-infested reforestation area--Olympic National\r\nForest, Washington.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Damage to jackpine caused by snowshoe hares--Dukes,\r\nMichigan.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Healthy Norway pine.

This is especially true on\r\ncut-over areas and where fires have destroyed all seedlings. Porcupines\r\nwill often destroy up to 90 percent of the seedlings and, through\r\ncontinued girdling of young trees 15 to 25 years of age, will destroy\r\nall chance for commercial timber for many years to come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Typical porcupine den.
