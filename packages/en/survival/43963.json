He tries to restore the physical\r\ngeography of each period of the past, and in this way to write a\r\nconnected history of the earth. His methods are in a general way\r\nsimilar to those of the ethnologist, the archæologist, and the\r\nhistorian, and he is confronted with difficulties resembling those\r\nwhich attend the researches of the students of human history. Foremost\r\namongst these difficulties is that due to the imperfection of the\r\ngeological record, but similar difficulty is felt by those who pursue\r\nthe study of other uncertain sciences, and whilst this imperfection is\r\nvery patent to the geologist, it is perhaps unduly exaggerated by\r\nthose who have only a general knowledge of the principles and aims of\r\ngeology.\r\n\r\nThe history of the earth, like other histories, is a connected one, in\r\nwhich one period is linked on to the next. This was not always\r\nsupposed to be the case; the catastrophic geologist of bygone times\r\nbelieved that after each great geological period a convulsion of\r\nnature left the earth's crust as a _tabula rasa_ on which a new set of\r\nrecords was engraved, having no connexion with those which had been\r\ndestroyed. Careful study of the records of the rocks has proved that\r\nthe conclusions of the catastrophists were erroneous, and that the\r\nevents of one period produce their impression upon the history of the\r\nnext. Every event which occurs, however insignificant, introduces a\r\nnew complication into the conditions of the earth, and accordingly\r\nthose conditions are never quite the same. Although the changes were\r\nno doubt very slow, so that the same general conditions may be traced\r\nas existent during two successive periods, minor complications\r\noccurred in the inorganic and organic worlds, and we never get an\r\nexact recurrence of events. Vegetable deposits may now be in process\r\nof accumulation which in ages to come may be converted into coal, but\r\nthe general conditions which were prevalent during that Carboniferous\r\nperiod when most of our workable coal was deposited do not now exist,\r\nand will never exist again. The changes which have taken place and\r\nwhich are taking place show an advance from the simple to the more\r\ncomplex, and the stratigraphical geologist is confronted with a\r\nproblem to which the key is development, and it is his task to trace\r\nthe development of the earth from the primitive state to the complex\r\ncondition in which we find it at the present day.\r\n\r\nOur general ignorance of the events of the earliest periods of the\r\nhistory of the earth will be emphasised in the sequel, and it will be\r\nfound that the complexity which marks the inorganic and organic\r\nconditions which existed during the deposition of the earliest rocks\r\nof which we have detailed knowledge points to the lapse of enormous\r\nperiods of time subsequent to the formation of the earth, and previous\r\nto the deposition of those rocks. The imperfection of the record is\r\nmost pronounced for that long period of time, but in this respect the\r\ngeologist is in the same condition as the student of human history,\r\nfor the relics of the early stone age prove that man in that age had\r\nattained a fairly high state of civilisation, and the gap which\r\nseparates palæolithic man from the first of our race is relatively\r\nspeaking as great as that which divides the Cambrian period from the\r\ncommencement of earth-history. Nevertheless, human history is a\r\nscience which has made gigantic strides towards the solution of many\r\nproblems connected with the development of man and civilisation, and\r\nsimilarly geology has advanced some way in its task of elucidating the\r\nhistory of our globe.\r\n\r\nThe task of the stratigraphical geologist is two-fold. In the first\r\nplace, he must establish the order of succession of the strata, for a\r\ncorrect chronology is of paramount importance to the student of\r\nearth-lore. The precautions which must be taken in making out the\r\norder of deposition of the rocks of any area, and correlating those of\r\none area with those of another will be considered in the body of the\r\nwork. When this task is completed, there yet remains the careful\r\nexamination of all the information supplied by a study of the rocks of\r\nthe crust, in order to ascertain the actual conditions which existed\r\nduring the deposition of any stratum or group of strata. In practice,\r\nit is generally very difficult to separate these two departments of\r\nthe labour of the stratigraphical geologist, and the two kinds of work\r\nare often done to a large extent simultaneously, or sometimes\r\nalternately. Frequently the general succession of the deposits\r\ncomprising an important group is ascertained, and at the same time\r\nobservations made concerning the physical characters of the deposits\r\nand the nature of their included organisms, which are sufficient to\r\nafford some insight into the general history of the period when these\r\ndeposits were laid down; a more detailed classification of the same\r\nset of deposits may be subsequently made, and as the result of this,\r\nmore minute observations as to the variations in the physical and\r\nbiological conditions of the period are possible, which permit us to\r\nwrite a much more concise history of the period. So great has been the\r\ntendency to carry on work in a more and more detailed manner, that it\r\nis very difficult if not impossible to tell when any approach to\r\nfinality is reached in the study of a group of strata in any area.\r\nRoughly speaking, we may state that our knowledge of a group of strata\r\nis obtained by three processes, or rather modifications of one\r\nprocess. The general order of succession is established by the\r\npioneer, frequently as the result of work carried on through one or\r\ntwo seasons. Subsequently to this, a more minute subdivision of the\r\nrocks is possible as the result of labours conducted by one or more\r\nworkers who are enabled to avail themselves of the work of the\r\npioneer, and our knowledge of the rocks is largely increased thereby.\r\nBut the minutiæ, often of prime importance, are supplied by workers\r\nwho must spend a large portion of their time in the area where the\r\nwork lies, and it is only in districts where work of this character\r\nhas been performed, that our knowledge of the strata approaches\r\ncompletion. The strata of the Arctic regions, for example, have in\r\nmany places been examined by pioneers, but a great deal remains to be\r\ndone in those regions; the main subdivisions only have been defined in\r\nmany cases, and our information concerning the physical history of\r\nArctic regions in past times is comparatively meagre. To come nearer\r\nhome--a few miles north of Cambridge lies the little patch of\r\nCorallian rock at Upware; it has been frequently visited, and a large\r\nsuite of organic remains extracted from it, but no one has devoted the\r\ntime to the collection of remains from this deposit which has been\r\ndevoted to that of some other formations presently to be mentioned,\r\nand accordingly our knowledge of the fauna of that deposit is far from\r\ncomplete. Contrast with this the information we possess of the little\r\nseam known as the Cambridge Greensand, from which organic remains have\r\nbeen sedulously collected during the extensive operations which have\r\nbeen carried on for the extraction of the phosphatic nodules which\r\noccur in the seam. The suite of relics of the organisms of that period\r\nis accordingly far more perfect than in the case of many other beds,\r\nand indeed the large and varied collection of relics of the vertebrata\r\nof the period which furnish much information of value to the\r\npalæontologist would not have been gathered together, had not this\r\nseam been so carefully worked, and an important paragraph in the\r\nchapter bearing on the history of this period would have remained\r\nunknown to us. Again, two little patches of limestone of the same age,\r\none in central England and the other in the island of Gothland, have\r\nbeen the objects of sedulous inquiry by local observers, and we find\r\nagain that our knowledge of the physical history of the period, as\r\nregards these two regions, is exceptionally perfect. Special stress is\r\nlaid upon this point, for in these days, when every county possesses\r\nits learned societies whose members are desirous of advancing in every\r\npossible way the progress of science, it is well to insist upon the\r\nimportance of this detailed work which can only be done by those who\r\nhave a large amount of time to devote to the rigorous examination of\r\nthe rocks of a limited area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nACCOUNT OF THE GROWTH AND PROGRESS OF STRATIGRAPHICAL GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the growth of a science is not always treated as an\r\nessential part of our knowledge of that science, and many text-books\r\nbarely allude to the past progress of the science with which they\r\ndeal. The importance of a review of past progress has, however,\r\nattracted the attention of many geologists, and Sir Charles Lyell, in\r\nhis _Principles of Geology_, gave prominence to an historical sketch\r\nof the rise and progress of the science. Historical studies of this\r\nnature have more than an academic value; the very errors made by men\r\nin past times are useful as warnings to prevent those of the present\r\nday from going astray; the lines along which a science has progressed\r\nin the past may often be used as guides to indicate how work is to be\r\nconducted in the future; but perhaps the greatest lesson which is\r\ntaught by a careful consideration of the rise and progress of a study\r\nis one which has a moral value, for he who pays attention to the\r\ngrowth of his science in past times, gains a reverence for the old\r\nmasters, and at the same time learns that a slavish regard for\r\nauthority is a dangerous thing. This is a lesson which is of the\r\nutmost importance to the student who wishes to advance his science,\r\nand will prevent him from paying too little attention to the work of\r\nthose who have gone before him, whilst it will enable him to perceive\r\nthat as great men have fallen into error through not having sufficient\r\ndata at their disposal, he need not be unduly troubled should he find\r\nthat conclusions which he has lawfully attained after consideration of\r\nevidence unknown to his predecessors clash with those which they\r\nadopted. Want of this historic knowledge has no doubt caused many\r\nworkers to waste their time on work which has already been performed,\r\nbut it has also led others to withhold important conclusions from\r\ntheir fellow-workers because they were supposed to be heterodox. In an\r\nuncertain science like geology one of the great difficulties is to\r\nkeep an even balance between contempt and undue respect for authority,\r\nand assuredly a scientific study of the past history of a science will\r\ndo much to enable a student to attain this end. It will be useful,\r\ntherefore, at this point to give a brief account of the rise and\r\nprogress of the study of stratigraphical geology, so far as that can\r\nbe done without entering into technical details, at the same time\r\nrecommending the student to survey the progress of this branch of our\r\nscience for himself, after he has mastered the principles of the\r\nsubject, and such details as are the property of all who have studied\r\nthe science from the various text-books written for advanced students.\r\n\r\nWilliam Smith, the 'Father of English Geology,' is rightly regarded as\r\nthe founder of stratigraphical geology on a true scientific basis, but\r\nlike all great discoverers, his work was foreshadowed by others,\r\nthough so dimly, that this does not and cannot detract from his fame.\r\nIt is desirable, however, to begin our historical review at a time\r\nsomewhat further back than that at which Smith gave to the world his\r\nepoch-making map and memoirs.\r\n\r\nBefore the eighteenth century, stratigraphical geology cannot be said\r\nto have existed as a branch of science--the way had not been prepared\r\nfor it. Data had been accumulated which would have been invaluable if\r\nat the disposal of open-minded philosophers, but with few exceptions\r\nprejudice prevented the truth from becoming known. There were two\r\ngreat stumbling-blocks to the establishment of a definite system of\r\nstratigraphical geology by the writers of the Middle Ages, firstly,\r\nthe contention that fossils were not the relics of organisms, and,\r\nsecondly, when it was conceded that they represented portions of\r\norganisms which had once existed, the assertion that they had reached\r\ntheir present positions out of reach of the sea during the Noachian\r\nDeluge. For full details concerning the mischievous effects of these\r\ntenets upon the science the reader is referred to the luminous sketch\r\nof the growth of geology in the first four chapters of Sir Charles\r\nLyell's _Principles of Geology_.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of rocks in strata, and the occurrence of different\r\nfossils in different strata, was known to Woodward when he published\r\nhis _Essay toward a Natural History of the Earth_ in 1695, and the\r\nvaluable collections made by Woodward and now deposited in the\r\nWoodwardian Museum at Cambridge, show how fully he appreciated the\r\nimportance of these facts, though he formed very erroneous conclusions\r\nfrom them, owing to the manner in which he drew upon his imagination\r\nwhen facts failed him, maintaining that fossils were deposited in the\r\nstrata according to their gravity, the heaviest sinking first, and the\r\nlightest last, during the time of the universal deluge. The following\r\nextracts from Part II. of Woodward's book, show the position in which\r\nour knowledge of the strata stood at the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury: \"The Matter, subsiding ..., formed the _Strata_ of Stone, of\r\nMarble, of Cole, of Earth, and the rest; of which Strata, lying one\r\nupon another, the Terrestrial Globe, or at least as much of it as is\r\never displayed to view, doth mainly consist.... The Shells of those\r\nCockles, Escalops, Perewinkles, and the rest, which have a greater\r\ndegree of Gravity, were enclosed and lodged in the _Strata_ of Stone,\r\nMarble, and the heavier kinds of Terrestrial Matter: the lighter\r\nShells not sinking down till afterwards, and so falling amongst the\r\nlighter Matter, such as Chalk, and the like ... accordingly we now\r\nfind the lighter kinds of Shells, such as those of the _Echini_, and\r\nthe like, very plentifully in Chalk.... Humane Bodies, the Bodies of\r\nQuadrupeds, and other Land-Animals, of Birds, of Fishes, both of the\r\nCartilaginous, the Squamose, and Crustaceous kinds; the Bones, Teeth,\r\nHorns, and other parts of Beasts, and of Fishes: the Shells of\r\nLand-Snails: and the Shells of those River and Sea Shell-Fish that\r\nwere lighter than Chalk &c. Trees, Shrubs, and all other Vegetables,\r\nand the Seeds of them: and that peculiar Terrestrial Matter whereof\r\nthese consist, and out of which they are all formed, ... were not\r\nprecipitated till the last, and so lay above all the former,\r\nconstituting the supreme or outmost _Stratum_ of the Globe.... The\r\nsaid _Strata_, whether of Stone, of Chalk, of Cole, of Earth, or\r\nwhatever other Matter they consisted of, lying thus each upon other,\r\nwere all originally parallel: ... they were plain, eaven, and\r\nregular.... After some time the _Strata_ were broken, on all sides of\r\nthe Globe: ... they were dislocated, and their Situation varied, being\r\nelevated in some places, and depressed in others ... the Agent, or\r\nforce, which effected this Disruption and Dislocation of the\r\n_Strata_, was seated _within_ the Earth.\"\r\n\r\nWoodward's writings no doubt exercised a direct influence on the\r\ngrowth of our subject, but the indirect effects of his munificent\r\nbequest to the University of Cambridge and his foundation of the Chair\r\nof Geology in that University were even greater, for as will be\r\npointed out in its proper place, two of the occupants of that chair\r\nplayed a considerable part in raising stratigraphical geology to the\r\nposition which it now occupies.\r\n\r\nThe discoveries which were made after the publication of Woodward's\r\nbook and before the appearance of the map and writings of William\r\nSmith are given in the memoir of the latter author, written by his\r\nnephew, who formerly occupied the Chair of Geology at Oxford[1]. It\r\nwould appear that the fact that \"the strata, considered as definitely\r\nextended masses, were arranged one upon another in a certain _settled\r\norder_ or _series_\" was first published by John Strachey in the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_ for 1719 and 1725. \"In a section he\r\nrepresents, in their true order, chalk, oolites, lias, red marls and\r\ncoal, and the metalliferous rocks\" of Somersetshire, but confines his\r\nattention to the rocks of a limited district.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Memoirs of William Smith, LL.D._ By J. Phillips, F.R.S.,\r\nF.G.S. 1844.]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John Michell published in the _Philosophical Transactions_\r\nfor 1760 an \"Essay on the Cause and Phænomena of Earthquakes,\" but\r\nProf. Phillips gives proofs that Michell, who in 1762 became\r\nWoodwardian Professor, had before 1788 discovered (what he never\r\npublished) the first approximate succession of the Mesozoic rocks, in\r\nthe district extending from Yorkshire to the country about Cambridge.\r\nMichell's account was discovered written by Smeaton on the back of a\r\nletter dated 1788. The following is the succession as quoted in\r\nPhillips' memoir (p. 136):\r\n\r\n                                     Yards of thickness.\r\n   \"Chalk                                 120\r\n    Golt                                   50\r\n    Sand of Bedfordshire                   10 to 20\r\n    Northamptonshire lime and Portland\r\n      lime, lying in several strata       100\r\n    Lyas strata                            78 to 100\r\n    Sand of Newark                        about 30\r\n    Red Clay of Tuxford, and several      100\r\n    Sherwood Forest pebbles and gravel     50 unequal\r\n    Very fine white sand                  uncertain\r\n    Roche Abbey and Brotherton limes      100\r\n    Coal strata of Yorkshire              --\"\r\n\r\nThe order of succession of the Cretaceous, Jurassic, Triassic and\r\nPermian beds will be readily recognised as indicated in this section,\r\nthough the discovery of the detailed succession of the Jurassic rocks\r\nwas reserved for Smith.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1778, John Whitehurst published _An Inquiry into the\r\nOriginal State and Formation of the Earth_, containing an Appendix in\r\nwhich the general succession of the strata of Derbyshire is noted. The\r\nmain points of interest are that the author clearly recognised the\r\n'toad-stones' of Derbyshire as igneous rocks, \"as much a _lava_ as\r\nthat which flows from Hecla, Vesuvius, or Ætna,\" though he believed\r\nthat they were intrusive and not contemporaneous, and he also\r\nforeshadows the distinction between the solid strata and the\r\nsuperficial deposits,--\"we may conclude,\" he says, \"that all beds of\r\nsand and gravel are assemblages of adventitious bodies and not\r\noriginal _strata_: therefore wherever sand or gravel form the surface\r\nof the earth, they conceal the original _strata_ from our observation,\r\nand deprive us of the advantages of judging, whether coal or limestone\r\nare contained in the lower regions of the earth, and more especially\r\nin flat countries where the _strata_ do not basset.\"\r\n\r\nWerner, who was born in 1750, exercised more influence by his teaching\r\nthan by his writings. His ideas of stratigraphical geology were\r\nsomewhat vitiated by his theoretical views concerning the deposition\r\nof sediment from a universal ocean, in a definite order, beginning\r\nwith granite, followed by gneiss, schists, serpentines, porphyries and\r\ntraps, and lastly ordinary sediments. He recognised and taught that\r\nthese rocks had a definite order \"in which the remains of living\r\nbodies are successively accumulated, in an order not less determinate\r\nthan that of the rocks which contain them[2].\" The limited value of\r\nWerner's stratigraphical teaching is accounted for by Lyell, who\r\nremarks that \"Werner had not travelled to distant countries; he had\r\nmerely explored a small portion of Germany, and conceived and\r\npersuaded others to believe that the whole surface of our planet, and\r\nall the mountain-chains in the world, were made after the model of his\r\nown province,\" and the author of the _Principles_ justly calls\r\nattention to the great importance of travel to the geologist. Those\r\nwho cannot travel extensively should at any rate pay special attention\r\nto the works published upon districts other than their own, and even\r\nat the present time, the writings of some British workers are apt to\r\nbe marked by some of that 'insularity' which our neighbours regard as\r\na national characteristic.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Cuvier's _Eloge_.]\r\n\r\nIt is now time to turn directly to the work of William Smith, who, of\r\nall men, exercised the most profound influence upon the study of\r\nstratigraphical geology and may indeed be regarded as the true founder\r\nof that branch of the science. The memoir of his life which was\r\nbefore mentioned is all too short to illustrate the methods of work\r\nwhich he followed, but in it we can trace his success to three\r\nthings:--firstly, his 'eye for a country,' to use a phrase which is\r\nthoroughly understood by practical geologists, though it is hard\r\nto explain to others, inasmuch as it epitomises a number of\r\nqualifications of which the most important are, a ready recognition of\r\nthe main geological features from some coign of vantage, an intuitive\r\nperception of what to note and what to neglect, and the power of\r\nstoring up acquired information in the mind rather than the note-book,\r\nso that one may use it almost unconsciously for future work; secondly,\r\nability to draw conclusions from his observations, and thirdly, and\r\nperhaps most important of all in its ultimate results, a facility for\r\nchecking these conclusions by means of further observations, and\r\ndropping those which were clearly erroneous, whilst extracting the\r\ntruth from those which contained a germ of truth mixed with error.\r\n\r\nBesides writers referred to above \"some foreign writers, in particular\r\nScilla and Rouelle, appear to have made very just comparisons of the\r\nnatural associations of fossil shells, corals, &c. in the earth, with\r\nthe groups of similar objects as they are found in the sea, and thus\r\nto have produced new proofs of the organic origin of these fossil\r\nbodies; but they give no sign of any knowledge of the _limitation of\r\nparticular tribes of organic remains to particular strata_, of the\r\n_successive existence of different groups of organization_, on\r\n_successive beds of the antient sea_. Mr Smith's claim to this happy\r\nand fertile induction is clear and unquestionable[3].\" We get a clue\r\nto the manner in which he arrived at his view in the following\r\npassage[4]:--\"Accustomed to view the surfaces of the several strata\r\nwhich are met with near Bath uncovered in large breadths at once, Mr\r\nSmith saw with the distinctness of certainty, that 'each stratum had\r\nbeen in succession the bed of the sea'; finding in several of these\r\nstrata abundance of the exuviae of marine animals, he concluded that\r\nthese animals had lived and died during the period of time which\r\nelapsed between the formation of the stratum below and the stratum\r\nabove, at or near the places where now they are imbedded; and\r\nobserving that in the successively-deposited strata the organic\r\nremains were of different forms and structures--Gryphites in the lias,\r\nTrigoniæ in the inferior oolite, hooked oysters in the fuller's\r\nearth,--and finding these facts repeated in other districts, he\r\ninferred that each of the separate periods occupied in the formation\r\nof the strata was accompanied by a peculiar series of the forms of\r\norganic life, that these forms characterized those periods, and that\r\nthe different strata could be identified in different localities and\r\notherwise doubtful cases by peculiar imbedded organic remains[5].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Memoir of William Smith_, p. 142.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Ibid._ p. 141.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The work of Smith which directly bears upon the\r\nestablishment of the law of identification of strata by included\r\norganisms is published in two treatises, entitled:--\r\n\r\n(i) _Strata identified by Organized Fossils_, 4to. (intended to\r\ncomprise seven parts, of which four only were published), commenced in\r\n1816.\r\n\r\n(ii) _A Stratigraphical System of Organized Fossils_, compiled from\r\nthe original Geological Collection deposited in the British Museum.\r\n4to. 1817.]\r\n\r\nWilliam Smith seems to have recognised intuitively the truth of a law\r\nwhich was but dimly understood before his time,--the law of\r\nsuperposition, which may be thus stated: \"of any two strata, the one\r\nwhich was originally the lower, is the older.\" This may appear\r\nself-evident but it was certainly not so. As the result of this\r\nrecognition he established the second great stratigraphical law, with\r\nwhich his name will ever be linked, that strata are identifiable by\r\ntheir included organisms.\r\n\r\nBefore Smith's time, geological maps were lithological rather than\r\nstratigraphical, they represented the different kinds of rocks seen\r\nupon the surface without regard to their age; since Smith\r\nrevolutionised geology, the maps of a country composed largely of\r\nstratified rocks are essentially stratigraphical, but partly no doubt\r\non account of adherence to old custom, partly on economic grounds, the\r\nmajority of our stratigraphical maps are lithological rather than\r\npalæontological, that is the subdivisions of the strata represented\r\nupon the map are chosen rather on account of lithological\r\npeculiarities than because of the variations in their enclosed\r\norganisms. It is hardly likely that Government surveys will be allowed\r\nto publish palæontological maps, which will be almost exclusively of\r\ntheoretical interest, and it remains for zealous private individuals\r\nto accomplish the production of such maps. When they are produced, a\r\ncomparison of stratigraphical maps founded on lithological and\r\npalæontological considerations will furnish results of extreme\r\nscientific interest.\r\n\r\nTurning now from Smith's contributions to the science as a whole, we\r\nmay now consider what he did for British geology. His geological map\r\nwas published in 1815 and was described as follows:--\"A Geological Map\r\nof England and Wales, with part of Scotland; exhibiting the\r\nCollieries, Mines, and Canals, the Marshes and Fen Lands originally\r\noverflowed by the Sea, and the varieties of Soil, according to the\r\nvariations of the Substrata; illustrated by the most descriptive Names\r\nof Places and of Local Districts; showing also the Rivers, Sites of\r\nParks, and principal Seats of the Nobility and Gentry, and the\r\nopposite Coast of France. By William Smith, Mineral Surveyor.\" The map\r\nwas originally on the scale of five miles to an inch. In 1819 a\r\nreduced map was published, and in later years a series of county maps.\r\nHe also published several geological sections, including one (in 1819)\r\nshowing the strata from London to Snowdon.\r\n\r\nThe student should compare Smith's map of the strata with one\r\npublished in modern times in order to see how accurate was Smith's\r\ndelineation of the outcrop of the later deposits of our island.\r\n\r\nThe following table, taken from Phillips' memoir, p. 146, is also of\r\ninterest as showing the development of Smith's work and the\r\ncompleteness of his classification in his later years, and as\r\nillustrating how much we are indebted to Smith for our present\r\nnomenclature, so much so that as Prof. Sedgwick remarked when\r\npresenting the first Wollaston Medal of the Geological Society to\r\nSmith, \"If in the pride of our present strength, we were disposed to\r\nforget our origin, our very speech would bewray us: for we use the\r\nlanguage which he taught us in the infancy of our science. If we, by\r\nour united efforts, are chiselling the ornaments and slowly raising up\r\nthe pinnacles of one of the temples of nature, it was he who gave the\r\nplan, and laid the foundations, and erected a portion of the solid\r\nwalls by the unassisted labour of his hands.\"[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The reader may consult an interesting paper by Professor\r\nJudd, on \"William Smith's Manuscript Maps,\" _Geological Magazine_,\r\nDecade IV. vol.

With the\r\nTertiary and Palæozoic Rocks it is otherwise, for some members of the\r\nformer are found in isolated patches, whilst the latter have usually\r\nbeen much disturbed after their formation.\r\n\r\nCommencing with the Tertiary deposits we may note that \"the first\r\ndeposits of this class, of which the characters were accurately\r\ndetermined, were those occurring in the neighbourhood of Paris,\r\ndescribed in 1810 by MM. Cuvier and Brongniart.... Strata were soon\r\nafterwards brought to light in the vicinity of London, and in\r\nHampshire, which although dissimilar in mineral composition were\r\njustly inferred by Mr T. Webster to be of the same age as those of\r\nParis, because the greater number of fossil shells were specifically\r\nidentical[7].\" It is to Lyell that we owe the establishment of a\r\nsatisfactory classification of the Tertiary deposits which is the\r\nbasis of later classifications. Recognising the difficulty of\r\napplying the ordinary test of superposition to deposits so scattered\r\nas are those of Tertiary age in north-west Europe, he in 1830,\r\nassisted by G. P. Deshayes, proposed a classification based on the\r\npercentage of recent mollusca in the various deposits. It may be\r\nnoted, that although this method was sufficient for the purpose, it\r\nhas been practically superseded, as the result of increase of our\r\nknowledge of the Tertiary faunas, by the more general method of\r\nidentifying the various divisions by their actual fossils without\r\nreference to the number of living forms contained amongst them. The\r\nfurther study of the British Tertiary rocks was largely carried on by\r\nJoseph Prestwich, formerly Professor of Geology in the University of\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Lyell, _Students' Elements of Geology_. 2nd Edition, p.\r\n118.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the Palæozoic rocks, it has been seen that the Permian,\r\nCarboniferous and some of the Devonian beds were recognised as\r\ndistinct by Smith, though a large number of deposits now known to\r\nbelong to the last named were thrown in with other rocks as 'killas.'\r\nThe Devonian system was established and the name given to it in 1838\r\nby Sedgwick and Murchison, largely owing to the palæontological\r\nresearches of Lonsdale. An attempt was subsequently made to abolish\r\nthe system, but the detailed palæontological studies of R. Etheridge\r\nfinally placed it upon a secure basis. The establishment of the\r\nDevonian system cleared the way for the right understanding of the\r\nLower Palæozoic rocks, which Sedgwick and Murchison had commenced to\r\nstudy before the actual establishment of the Devonian system, and to\r\nthese workers belongs the credit of practically completing what was\r\nbegun by William Smith, namely, the establishment of the Geological\r\nSequence of the British strata. The controversy which unfortunately\r\nmarked the early years of the study of the British Lower Palæozoic\r\nRocks is well-nigh forgotten, and in the future the names of Sedgwick\r\nand Murchison will be handed down together, in the manner which is\r\nmost fitting.\r\n\r\nOur account of the growth of British Stratigraphical Geology is not\r\nyet complete. In 1854, Sir William Logan applied the term Laurentian\r\nto a group of rocks discovered in Canada, which occurred beneath the\r\nLower Palæozoic Rocks. Murchison shortly afterwards claimed certain\r\nrocks in N.W. Scotland as being of generally similar age, and since\r\nthen a number of geologists, most of whom are still living, have\r\nproved the occurrence of several large subdivisions of rocks in\r\nBritain, each of which is of pre-Palæozoic age.\r\n\r\nThe above is a brief description of the growth of our knowledge of the\r\norder of succession of the strata which is the foundation of\r\nStratigraphical Geology. A sketch of the manner in which the knowledge\r\nwhich has been obtained has been applied to the elucidation of the\r\nearth's history of different times would require far more space than\r\ncan be devoted to it in a work like the present, but some idea of it\r\nmay be gained from a study of the later chapters of the book. It will\r\nsuffice here to remark, that to Godwin-Austen we owe the foundation of\r\nwhat may be termed the physical branch of Palæo-physiography, which is\r\nconcerned with the restoration of the physical conditions of past\r\nages, while Cuvier and Darwin have exerted the most influence on the\r\nstudy of Stratigraphical Palæontology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE STRATIFIED ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present constituents of the earth which are accessible for direct\r\nstudy are divisible into three parts. The inner portion, consisting of\r\n_rocks_, is known as the _lithosphere_; outside this, with portions of\r\nthe lithosphere projecting through into the outermost part, is the\r\n_hydrosphere_, comprising the ocean, lakes, rivers, and all masses of\r\nwater which rest upon the lithosphere in a liquid condition. The\r\noutermost envelope, which is continuous and unbroken is the\r\n_atmosphere_, in a gaseous condition. It is well known that some of\r\nthe constituents of any one of these parts may be abstracted from it,\r\nand become a component of either of the others; thus the atmosphere\r\nabstracts aqueous vapour from the hydrosphere, and the lithosphere\r\ntakes up water from the hydrosphere, and carbonic anhydride from the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe nebular hypothesis of Kant and Laplace necessitates the former\r\nexistence of the present solid portions of the lithosphere in a molten\r\ncondition, and accordingly the first formed solid covering of the\r\nlithosphere, if this hypothesis be true, must have been formed from\r\nmolten material, or in the language of Geology, it was an _igneous\r\nrock_. Consequently, the earliest _sedimentary rock_ was necessarily\r\nderived directly from an igneous rock, with possible addition of\r\nmaterial from the early hydrosphere and atmosphere, and all\r\nsubsequently formed sedimentary rocks have therefore been derived from\r\nigneous rocks (with the additions above stated) either directly, or\r\nindirectly through the breaking up of other sedimentary rocks which\r\nwere themselves derived directly or indirectly from igneous rocks. The\r\nobservations of geologists show that this supposition that the\r\nmaterials of sediments have been directly or indirectly obtained for\r\nthe most part from once-molten rocks is in accordance with the\r\nobserved facts, and so far their observations testify to the truth of\r\nthe nebular hypothesis. This being the case, the study of the\r\npetrology of the igneous rocks is necessary, in order to arrive at a\r\ntrue understanding of the composition of the sedimentary ones. The\r\nigneous rocks are largely composed of four groups of minerals,\r\nviz.--quartz, felspars, ferro-magnesian minerals, and ores. Of these\r\nthe quartz (composed of silica) yields particles of silica for the\r\nformation of sedimentary rocks; the felspars, which are double\r\nsilicates of alumina and an alkali or alkaline earth, being prone to\r\ndecomposition furnish silicate of alumina and compounds of soda,\r\npotash, lime, &c. The ferro-magnesian minerals (such as augite,\r\nhornblende and mica) may undergo a certain amount of decomposition,\r\nand yield compounds of iron, lime, &c. We may also have fragments of\r\nany of these minerals, and of the ore group in an unaltered condition.\r\nThe composition of a sedimentary rock which has undergone no\r\nalteration after its formation will therefore depend upon the\r\ncharacter of the rock from which it was derived, the chemical changes\r\nwhich take place in the materials which compose it, before they enter\r\ninto its mass, and the mechanical sorting which they undergo prior to\r\ntheir deposition.\r\n\r\nIn the above passage the terms igneous rock and sedimentary rock have\r\nbeen used, and it is necessary to give some account of the sense in\r\nwhich they were used.\r\n\r\nAn _igneous_ rock is one which has been _consolidated_ from a state of\r\n_fusion_. It is not necessary to discuss here the exact significance\r\nof the word fusion, and whether certain rocks which are included in\r\nthe igneous division were formed rather from solution at high\r\ntemperature than from actual fusion. This point is of importance to\r\nthe petrologist, but to the student of stratigraphical geology the\r\nterm igneous rock may be used in its most comprehensive sense. These\r\nigneous rocks were consolidated either upon the surface of the\r\nlithosphere or in its interior.\r\n\r\nThe other great group of rocks is one to which it is difficult to\r\napply a satisfactory name. They have been termed by different writers,\r\n_sedimentary_, _stratified_, _derivative_, _aqueous_, and _clastic_,\r\nbut no one of these terms is strictly accurate. The term _sedimentary_\r\nimplies that they have settled down, at the bottom of a sheet of water\r\nfor instance. It can hardly be maintained that limestones formed by\r\norganic agency, like the limestones of coral reefs, are sedimentary in\r\nthe strict sense of the term, and an accumulation like surface-soil\r\ncan only be called a sediment by straining the term. _Stratified_\r\nrocks are those which are formed in strata or layers, but many of the\r\nrocks which we are considering do not show layers on a small scale,\r\nand igneous rocks (such as lava-flows) are also found in layers,\r\nthough such layers are not true strata in the sense in which the term\r\nis used by geologists; the term _stratified_ is perhaps the least open\r\nto objection of any of those named above. _Derivative_ implies that\r\nthe fragments have been derived from some pre-existing rock, but as\r\nthere are many ways in which fragments of one rock may be derived from\r\nanother, the term is too comprehensive. _Aqueous_ rocks should be\r\nformed in water, and most of the class of rocks which we are\r\nconsidering have been so formed, but others such as sand-dunes and\r\nsurface-soil have not. (The term Aerial or Æolian has been suggested\r\nto include these rocks which are thus separated from the Aqueous rocks\r\nproper; the objection to this is that the origin of these rocks is\r\nclosely connected with that of the true Aqueous rocks, and moreover\r\nthe group is too small to be raised to the dignity of a separate\r\nsubdivision.) Lastly, the name _clastic_ has been given, because the\r\nrocks so called are formed by the _breaking up_ of pre-existing rocks.\r\nThere are two objections to this name. In the first place, some rocks\r\nincluded under the head clastic are formed by solution of material and\r\nits consolidation from a state of solution by chemical or organic\r\nagency, though we may perhaps speak of rocks being broken up by\r\nchemical as well as by mechanical action. The most important objection\r\nis that many clastic rocks are formed by the breaking up of rocks\r\nsubsequently to their formation, and it has been proposed that rocks\r\nof this nature should be termed _cataclastic_, while those which are\r\nformed by the breaking up of pre-existing rocks upon the earth's\r\nsurface should be termed _epiclastic_; another group formed of\r\nmaterials broken up within the earth, and accumulated upon its surface\r\nas the result of ejection of fragmental material from volcanic vents\r\nbeing termed _pyroclastic_. This classification is scientific, and\r\nunder special circumstances is extremely useful, but the older terms\r\nhave been used so generally, and with this explanation their use is so\r\nunobjectionable, that they may be retained, and the term _stratified_\r\nwill be generally used to indicate all rocks which are not of igneous\r\norigin or formed as mineral veins in the earth's interior.\r\n\r\nThe division of rocks into _three_ great groups, the Igneous,\r\nStratified and Metamorphic (the latter name being applied to those\r\nrocks which have undergone considerable alteration since their\r\nformation), is objectionable, since we have metamorphic igneous rocks\r\nas well as metamorphic stratified ones. The most convenient\r\nclassification is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  A. Igneous       1. { Unaltered.\r\n                   2. { Metamorphic.\r\n\r\n  B. Stratified    1. { Unaltered.\r\n                   2. { Metamorphic.\r\n\r\nIt must be distinctly understood that all geological phenomena must be\r\ntaken into account by the stratigraphical geologist. The upheaval of\r\nstrata, the production of jointing and cleavage in them, their\r\nintrusion by igneous material, their metamorphism, give indications of\r\nformer physical conditions equally with the lithological characters of\r\nthe strata, and their fossil contents. Nevertheless it is not proposed\r\nto give a full account of the various phenomena displayed by rocks;\r\nthe student is referred to Text-books of General Geology for this\r\ninformation. It will be as well here, however, to point out in a few\r\nwords the exact significance of the existence of strata in the\r\nlithosphere.\r\n\r\nThe formation of strata and their subsequent destruction to supply\r\nmaterial for fresh strata are due to three great classes of changes.\r\nBeginning with a portion of lithosphere composed of rock, it is found\r\nthat rock is broken up by agents of denudation, as wind, rain, frost,\r\nrivers and sea. These agents perform their function mainly upon the\r\nportion of the lithosphere which projects through the hydrosphere to\r\nform _land_, and the land is the main area of denudation. The\r\nmaterials furnished by denudation are carried away, and owing to\r\ngravitation, naturally proceed from a higher to a lower level, often\r\nresting on the way, but if nothing else occurs, ultimately finding\r\ntheir way to the _sea_, where they are deposited as strata. The sea is\r\nthe principal area for the reception of this material, and it is there\r\naccordingly that the bulk of stratified rock is formed. If nothing\r\nelse occurred, in time the whole of the land would be destroyed, and\r\nthe wreckage of the land deposited beneath the sea as stratified rock.\r\nAs it is there is a third class of change, underground change, causing\r\nmovements of the earth's crust (to use a term which can hardly be\r\ndefined in few words but which is generally understood), and as the\r\nresult of the relative uplift of portions of the earth's crust, the\r\nstratified rocks formed beneath the oceans are raised above its level,\r\ngiving rise to new masses of land, which are once more ready for\r\ndestruction by the agents of denudation. This cycle of change (all\r\nparts of which are ever proceeding simultaneously) is one of the\r\nutmost importance to the stratigraphical geologist.\r\n\r\n_Stratification_ is the rock-structure of prime importance in\r\nstratigraphical geology, and a few words must here be devoted to its\r\nconsideration, leaving further details to be dealt with hereafter. The\r\nsurface of the ocean-floor is, when viewed on a large scale, so level,\r\nthat it may be considered practically horizontal, and accordingly in\r\nmost places the materials which are laid down on the ocean-floor give\r\nrise to accumulations which at all times have a general horizontal\r\nsurface (when the ocean-slopes depart markedly from horizontality the\r\ndeposits tend to abut against these slopes rather than to lie with\r\ntheir upper surfaces parallel to their original angle). A practically\r\nhorizontal surface of this character may give rise to a _plane of\r\nstratification_ (or _bedding-plane_) in more than one way. A pause may\r\noccur during which there is a cessation of the supply of material, so\r\nthat the material which has already been accumulated has sufficient\r\ntime to become partially consolidated before the deposition of fresh\r\nmaterial upon it. In this way a want of coherence between the two\r\nmasses is produced, along the plane of junction, which after\r\nconsolidation of the deposits causes an actual divisional plane along\r\nwhich the two deposits may be separated. This is a plane of\r\nstratification. The pause may be produced in various ways, sometimes\r\nbetween successive high tides, at others as the result of physical\r\nchanges which may have taken ages to happen. Again, after material of\r\none kind has been deposited, say sand, some other substance such as\r\nclay may be accumulated on its upper surface, giving rise to a plane\r\nof stratification between two deposits of different lithological\r\ncharacters. If this occurs alone, there may be actual coherence\r\nbetween the two strata, so that it is erroneous to speak of a plane of\r\nstratification as if it were always one along which one deposit could\r\nbe readily split from the other, though as a general though by no\r\nmeans universal rule, change from one kind of deposit to another is\r\nalso marked by want of coherence between the two. The material between\r\ntwo planes of stratification forms a _stratum_ or _bed_, though if the\r\ndeposit be very thin it is known as a _lamina_, and the planes are\r\nspoken of as _planes of lamination_ (no hard and fast line can be\r\ndrawn between strata and laminæ; several of the latter usually occur\r\nin the space of an inch).\r\n\r\nA _stratum_ will have its upper and lower surface apparently parallel,\r\nthough not really so, for no stratum extends universally round the\r\nearth, and many of them disappear at no great distance when traced in\r\nany direction. Parts of one stratum may be composed of different\r\nmaterials from other parts when traced laterally, thus one stratum may\r\nbe found composed essentially of sand in one place, of mud in another,\r\nand of a mixture of the two in an intervening locality. Whatever be\r\nthe composition of a stratum it dies out eventually, owing to the\r\ncoming together of the upper and lower bounding planes of\r\nstratification. The stratum is thickest at some spot, from that spot\r\nit becomes thinner in all directions, until it disappears at last by\r\nthe coalescence of the bounding-planes. This is spoken of as\r\n_thinning-out_. Strata, then, consist of lenticular masses of rock,\r\nseparated from the underlying and overlying strata by planes of\r\nstratification. The shape of the lenticle may vary immensely, the\r\nthickness bearing no definite relationship to the horizontal extent.\r\nSome strata, many feet in thickness, may thin out and disappear\r\ncompletely in the course of a few yards, whilst others an inch or two\r\nin thickness may be traced horizontally for many miles. We often find\r\nthin strata of coal and limestone, extending for great distances,\r\nstrata of mud thinning out more rapidly, and sandstones still more\r\nrapidly, but no universal rule connecting rapidity of thinning-out\r\nwith composition of the strata can be laid down.\r\n\r\nHaving seen what a stratum is, it now remains to speak of the\r\ncomposition of the stratified rocks. They have been classified\r\naccording to their composition, and according to their origin.\r\nAccording to composition they have been divided into:\r\n\r\n    _Arenaceous_ rocks, composed essentially of grains of sand.\r\n\r\n    _Argillaceous_ rocks, composed essentially of particles of\r\n       mud.\r\n\r\n    _Calcareous_ rocks, composed essentially of particles of\r\n       carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\n    _Carbonaceous_ rocks, composed largely of hydrocarbon\r\n       compounds.\r\n\r\n    _Siliceous rocks_, composed essentially of silica not in the\r\n       form of grains;\r\n\r\nwhilst according to their origin they have been separated into:--\r\n\r\n    _Mechanically-formed_ rocks, composed of fragments derived\r\n       from other rocks by mechanical fracture.\r\n\r\n    _Chemically-formed_ rocks, composed of particles which have\r\n       been chemically deposited from a state of solution.\r\n\r\n    _Organically-formed_ rocks, composed of materials which have\r\n       been derived from a state of solution or from the gaseous\r\n       condition by the agency of organisms.\r\n\r\nWhichever classification be adopted (and each is useful for special\r\npurposes), it must be noted that no hard and fast line can be drawn\r\nbetween one division and another. A rock may be partly arenaceous and\r\npartly calcareous, composed of a mixture of sand and lime, and the\r\nsame rock may similarly be partly mechanically and partly organically\r\nformed, the sand being due to mechanical fracture, and the lime to the\r\nagency of organisms, and so with the other divisions.\r\n\r\nAs many of the changes which have occurred in past times have been\r\nconcerned in destruction and obliteration, whilst deposition is the\r\ncause of preservation, the study of deposits is peculiarly adapted for\r\ntesting the truth of the grand principle of geology that the changes\r\nwhich have taken place in past times are generally speaking similar in\r\nkind and in intensity of action to those which are in progress at the\r\npresent day, and a study of the modern deposits is specially important\r\nas throwing light upon the characters of those which have been formed\r\nin past times. It will be abundantly shown in the sequel that the\r\ndeposits of the strata are in general comparable in all essential\r\nrespects with those which are being formed at present, and accordingly\r\nthey give most valuable indications as to the nature of the physical\r\nand other conditions under which they were laid down. The desert sand,\r\nthe precipitate of the inland sea, the reef-limestone and many another\r\ndeposit can thus be detected by an examination of their lithological\r\ncharacters, combined with consideration of other kinds of evidence.\r\nThe petrology of the sedimentary rocks is still in its infancy, though\r\nmuch has already been done, but it offers a wide field of inquiry to\r\nthe field-geologist and worker with the microscope[8].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The student will do well to consult _The Challenger\r\nReport_ by Messrs Murray and Renard (1891), for information concerning\r\nmany modern sediments, and Harker's _Petrology for Students_ Section\r\nD, for general information on the Petrology of the Stratified Rocks.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF SUPERPOSITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter this law was given as follows: \"Of any two\r\nstrata, the one which was originally the lower is the older;\" the\r\ngeneral truth of the law depends upon the fact that except under very\r\nexceptional circumstances the strata are deposited upon the surface of\r\nthe lithosphere, and not beneath it. There are occasions where strata\r\nmay be deposited beneath the lithosphere, but as a general rule the\r\ngeologist will not be misled by such occurrences. In caverns,\r\naccumulations often occur which are newer than the strata over the\r\ncavern roof, and so long as caverns are formed in ordinary sedimentary\r\nrocks, no great difficulty will result from this exception to the law\r\nof superposition. When caverns occur beneath masses of land ice, the\r\norder of superposition may be misleading. A deposit may be formed on\r\nthe surface of the ice, and subsequently to this a newer deposit may\r\nbe laid down in a sub-glacial or englacial cavern; upon the melting of\r\nthe ice the newer deposit would be found with the older one resting\r\nupon its surface.\r\n\r\nApart from these exceptional cases, the law as stated holds good, but\r\nthe reader will notice the insertion of the word 'originally' which\r\nrequires some comment.\r\n\r\nA geologist speaks of one bed lying _upon_ another not only when the\r\nbeds are horizontal, but when they are inclined at any angle, until\r\nthey become vertical, so that until beds have been turned through an\r\nangle of 90° by earth-movement the test of superposition is\r\napplicable, but when they have been turned more than 90°, the stratum\r\nwhich was originally lower rests upon that which was originally above\r\nit, and in the case of these _inverted_ strata, the test of\r\nsuperposition is no longer applicable. It was formerly supposed that\r\ncases of inversion were comparatively rare and local, and that the\r\ntest of superposition could therefore be generally applied with\r\nconfidence, but it is now known that though this is generally true of\r\nsuch strata as have been subjected only to those widespread, fairly\r\nuniform movements which are spoken of as _epeirogenic_ or\r\ncontinent-forming, where the radius of each curve is very long,\r\ninversion is a frequent accompaniment of the more local _orogenic_ or\r\nmountain-forming movements, where the radius of a curve is short.\r\nThough orogenic movements are limited as compared with those of\r\nepeirogenic character, they often affect large tracts of country, in\r\nwhich case the apparent order of succession of the strata need not be\r\nthe true one, and examples of inversion may be frequent[9].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: For a discussion of the principles of mountain-building\r\nsee Heim, A., _Untersuchungen über den Mechanismus der\r\nGebirgsbildung_, and Lapworth, C. \"The Secret of the Highlands,\"\r\n_Geological Magazine_, Decade II. vol. x. pp. 120, 193, 337.]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to lay down any definite rules for detecting inverted\r\nstrata, where the top of an inverted arch is swept off by denudation\r\nor the bottom of an inverted trough concealed beneath the surface,\r\nbeyond stating that if an easily recognised set of beds is obviously\r\nrepeated in inverse order, inversion must have occurred, though even\r\nthen it may not be clear which side of the fold shows the beds in\r\noriginal and which in inverted sequence. Suggestions are frequently\r\nmade that ripple-marks and worm-tracks may be utilised in order to\r\ndiscover inversion, for the well-formed ripple-marks will appear\r\nconvex on the upper surface of a bed which is not inverted, and we may\r\nnote concave casts of these ripple-marks on the under surface of the\r\noverlying bed, whilst worm-tracks will appear concave on the upper\r\nsurface, and their casts convex on the lower surface of the succeeding\r\nbed under similar conditions. In the case of inversion the occurrences\r\nwill be the exact opposite to these. Unfortunately ripple-marks and\r\nworm-tracks may, as will appear in the sequel, be simulated by\r\nstructures produced in quite a different way, and unless the observer\r\nis certain that he is confronted with true ripple-marks and\r\nworm-tracks he may be seriously misled. The geologist must take into\r\naccount all the evidence at his disposal, when he is dealing with\r\ncases of possible inversion, but oftentimes he will after due\r\nconsideration of all the phenomena be left in doubt unless he is able\r\nto supplement his observations on the succession of the strata by\r\nevidence derived from the included fossils.\r\n\r\nThe test of superposition is most apt to be misleading when the strata\r\nhave been affected by the faults known as reversed faults or\r\nthrust-planes.\r\n\r\nReference to text-books will show that a fold consists of two parts,\r\nthe arch and the trough, and that the two are connected by a common-,\r\nmiddle-, or partition-limb. In the case of an inverted fold, an\r\n=S=-shaped or sigmoidal structure is the result (Fig. 1 A).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nA. A sigmoidal fold, showing a bed _xx_ in an overfold with arch\r\n(_a_), trough (_t_) and common limb _c_.\r\n\r\nB. A similar bed _xx_ affected by a thrust-plane _tt_ which replaces\r\nthe common limb.]\r\n\r\nHere the portions of any bed (_xx_) which occur in the arch or trough\r\nare in normal position, and have not been moved round through an angle\r\nof 90°, whilst the portion which occurs in the common limb c has been\r\nmoved round through an angle greater than 90° and is inverted, so that\r\nits former upper surface now faces downwards. In Fig. 1 B the common\r\nlimb is replaced by a reversed fault, or thrust-plane, and the\r\ninverted portion of the bed seen in the common limb is therefore\r\nabsent. An observer, applying the test of superposition, might suppose\r\nthat the position of the bed _x_ on the left-hand side of the figure\r\nwas a different bed from the portion which is seen on the right-hand\r\nside, instead of belonging to the same bed, and in this way, if a\r\nnumber of parallel thrust-planes affected one bed or a set of beds, he\r\nmight be led to infer the occurrence of a great thickness of strata\r\nwhere there was in reality a slight thickness, or even one bed only\r\nrepeated again and again by faulting. It is quite certain that\r\nexaggerated estimates of the thickness of deposits have frequently\r\nbeen made owing to the non-recognition of the occurrence of repetition\r\nas a consequence of the existence of thrust-planes.\r\n\r\nWhere thrust-planes are suspected, it is well to look for some of the\r\nfollowing features:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The strata of a country affected by thrust-planes often crop out\r\nas lenticular masses, thinning out rapidly in the direction of the\r\nstrike[10]. This is true of beds thrown into sharp folds whether or\r\nnot inverted, but the lenticles will be wider in a direction at right\r\nangles to that of the strike as compared with their length when\r\ninversion has not occurred. It is also true of beds which were\r\noriginally deposited as lenticles, such as many massive sandstones,\r\nand as almost any kind of deposit may be formed originally as a\r\nlenticle, the test by itself is by no means sufficient as a proof of\r\nthrusting, though it is suggestive.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: For definitions of the terms dip, strike, outcrop and\r\nallied expressions, the reader is referred to a _Text-Book of\r\nGeology_.]\r\n\r\n(_b_) The _surfaces_ of the strata are often affected by the\r\nstriations known as slickensides, and the joint-faces of gently\r\ninclined beds are also frequently marked by slickensides which often\r\nrun in a nearly horizontal direction.\r\n\r\n(_c_) A parallel structure presenting the appearances characteristic\r\nof the mechanically-formed features of a foliated rock is often\r\ndeveloped, and one or more of certain accompanying phenomena will\r\nprobably be found, which will be noticed more fully in a later\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Extension or stretching of the rocks will have been frequently\r\nproduced, causing rupture, and the resulting fissures are usually\r\nfilled with mineral-veins, though this occurrence is by no means\r\ncharacteristic of rocks which have been affected by thrust-planes.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Chemical changes may have occurred which have resulted in the\r\nreconstitution of some of the rock-constituents, which may crystallise\r\nwhere pressure is least, thus we often find rocks which have undergone\r\nmovements of the type we are considering marked by the existence of\r\nsericitic films upon the surfaces.\r\n\r\nAnother reservation must be made when considering the law of\r\nsuperposition. The test is only applicable for limited areas. Suppose\r\nwe find a deposit of clay _a_ resting upon another deposit of\r\nlimestone _b_ in the south of England, and can prove that the apparent\r\nsuccession is the true one, that is, that there has been no inversion;\r\nit is clear that the test of superposition is applicable in that area.\r\nNow, we may be able to trace the two deposits continuously across the\r\ncountry, one as a clay, the other as a limestone; so that when we\r\nreach the north of England we find the clay _a_ still reposing upon\r\nthe limestone _b_. The test of superposition is applicable in that\r\narea also, the clay of the northern area being newer than the\r\nlimestone of the same region. But, for reasons which will ultimately\r\nappear, it by no means follows that the clay of the north is newer\r\nthan the limestone of the south, although the two deposits are\r\ncontinuously traceable with the same lithological characters; it may\r\nhave been formed simultaneously with the limestone of the south, or\r\neven before it. Something more, therefore, than the test of\r\nsuperposition is necessary in order to make out the relative ages of\r\ncontinuous deposits in a wide region, and this is still truer in the\r\ncase of deposits which are discontinuous, whether separated from one\r\nanother by the sea, or by outcrops of older or newer rocks.\r\n\r\nA few words of warning may be added with reference to the detection of\r\nbedding-planes. A bedding-plane is one which separates two beds, and\r\nits existence is determined during the deposition of the beds. Many\r\nother planes are formed in rocks subsequently to their deposition, and\r\nit is not always easy to distinguish these from true bedding-planes.\r\nThat even experienced observers may be led astray is shown by the fact\r\nthat, of recent years, it has been proved that great masses of rock\r\nhave been claimed as of sedimentary origin, and their apparent order\r\nof succession noted, which are in truth naught but irregular masses of\r\nintrusive igneous rocks affected by divisional planes which simulate\r\nbedding, produced in the rocks subsequently to their consolidation.\r\nJoints, faults, and cleavage-planes may all at times simulate planes\r\nof bedding, and it is frequently very difficult to distinguish them in\r\nthe limited exposures with which a geologist has oftentimes to deal.\r\nIt is easier to make suggestions for distinguishing bedding-planes\r\nfrom other planes which simulate them, than to apply the suggestions\r\nin practice, and the student of field geology will find that\r\nexperience is the only guide, though after years of experience he may\r\nbe confronted with cases where the evidence is insufficient to\r\nconvince him that he is dealing with planes of stratification and not\r\nwith some other structure.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been remarked, it will be inferred that the test of\r\nsuperposition though of prime importance to the geologist is\r\nfrequently insufficient to enable him to ascertain the true order of\r\nsuccession of the strata, and he is compelled to supplement this test\r\nby some other. There are several useful physical tests which may\r\nfrequently be applied. Thus, if a rock _a_ contains fragments of\r\nanother rock _b_, _under such circumstances as to show that the\r\nfragments of_ b _were included in a during its deposition_, it is\r\nclear that _b_ is older than _a_. Here again, it will be found from\r\nwhat appears in a later chapter that the student is confronted with\r\ndifficulties when actually examining rocks, for fragmental rocks of\r\ncataclastic origin, where the fragments have been formed as the result\r\nof fracture produced by earth-movements subsequently to the deposition\r\nof the rock, simulate epiclastic rocks in which the fragments were\r\nintroduced during the accumulation of the deposits to so surprising a\r\ndegree as sometimes to baffle the most experienced observer. Not only\r\nare the fragments of these cataclastic rocks broken up, but they may\r\nbe further rounded so as to imitate in a remarkable manner the\r\nwater-worn pebbles of an epiclastic conglomerate. Again, an older\r\nseries of rocks may have had structures impressed upon them as the\r\nresult of changes subsequent to their formation, and before the\r\nformation of a newer set which the latter therefore do not exhibit.\r\nJointing, cleavage, and various metamorphic phenomena may thus be\r\nexhibited by the older rocks, but great care is required in applying\r\nthis test, especially with a limited thickness of rocks, as one set\r\nmay not exhibit the structures not because they were not in existence\r\nwhen the structures were developed, but because their nature is such\r\nthat they were incapable of receiving or retaining the structures. For\r\ninstance a mass of grit which is older than a mass of clay-slate may\r\nnot be cleaved, because, although subjected to the pressure which\r\nproduced the cleavage, it was of a nature not adapted to the\r\ndevelopment of cleavage structure.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, application of tests dependent upon physical features of\r\nrocks, does not often supplement to any great extent the information\r\nsupplied by ascertaining the order of superposition, and in all\r\ncases, where possible, every other kind of information should be\r\nsupplemented, by that which is acquired after examination of the\r\nincluded organisms of the strata.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE TEST OF INCLUDED ORGANISMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second great law of the Stratigraphical Geologist is that\r\nfossiliferous strata are identifiable by their included organisms, in\r\nother words, that we can tell the geological age of deposits by\r\nexamination of the fossils contained in them, though the determination\r\nof age must be given in more general terms in some cases than in\r\nothers. Considerable misconception has arisen concerning the value of\r\nfossils as indices of age, and it is necessary therefore to discuss\r\nthe significance of the law of identification of strata by their\r\nincluded organisms at some length.\r\n\r\nThe comparison between fossils and medals has frequently been made and\r\nfossils have well been styled the \"Medals of Creation\"; and the\r\nsignificance of fossils as guides to the age of deposits may perhaps\r\nbe made clearer if we pursue this comparison some way. In the first\r\nplace there is clear indication of a gradual increase in the\r\ncomplexity of organisation of the fossils as one passes from the\r\nearlier to the later rocks, and accordingly the general facies of a\r\nfauna is likely to furnish a clue to the age of the rocks in which it\r\nis found, even though every species or even genus represented in the\r\nfauna was previously unknown to science. So an antiquary versed in the\r\nevolution of art or metallurgy, might detect the general age of a\r\nmedal with whose image and superscription he was not acquainted. He\r\nwould know that a medal struck in iron was formed subsequently to the\r\nbronze age, or that one formed of palladium appertained to the present\r\ncentury. But quite apart from any theoretical knowledge, an antiquary\r\nwould find as the result of accumulated experience that certain medals\r\nare characteristic of certain periods; he would learn that the\r\ndenarius is characteristic of a different period from that indicated\r\nby the coin of the Victorian era, even though he had no knowledge of\r\nthe technicalities of numismatics. The same is the case with the\r\ngeologist. He may not be influenced by any knowledge of the evolution\r\nof faunas and floras, but actual work amongst the rocks will show him\r\nthat the trilobite is not found with the belemnite or the ichthyosaur\r\nwith the elephant, save under exceptional circumstances, which only\r\nprove the rule, as for instance when worn bones of ichthyosaurs are\r\nwashed from their proper strata into gravels with elephant-bones.\r\n\r\nIt must be distinctly understood that the determination of fossils as\r\ncharacteristic of different periods is solely made as the result of\r\nexperience. No _à priori_ reasoning may give one indication of the\r\nactual range in time of a species or genus; no one can say why\r\n_Discina_ has a long range in time, whilst that of the closely related\r\n_Trematis_ is very limited. This being the case, the greater the mass\r\nof evidence which is accumulated as to the range of a fossil, the\r\ngreater will be the value of that fossil as a clue to the age of the\r\ndeposit in which it is found. This is so important, that it requires\r\nmore than mere notice. If a fossil is found in abundance in a group of\r\nstrata _B_ in any one area, and is not found in an underlying group\r\n_A_ or overlying group _C_ in that area after prolonged search, we\r\nmay confidently speak of the fossil as characteristic of the strata\r\n_B_ in that area, though without further work, the value of the fossil\r\nas a clue to age in other areas would be unproved. It may nevertheless\r\nhappen, that after more prolonged search in _A_ or _C_, in the\r\noriginal area a few specimens of the fossil which has been spoken of\r\nas characteristic of _B_ may be found in one or other of them, in\r\nsmall quantity. The value of the fossil as one characteristic of _B_\r\nwill be slightly diminished, though only slightly, as it is not likely\r\nto turn up in numbers in the strata _A_ or _C_ after the prolonged\r\nsearch. Should the fossil be found also to be characteristic of the\r\nstrata _B_ in areas other than the original one, it becomes of more\r\nthan local value, and if, after much study it is found to characterise\r\nthe same strata over wide areas, the cumulative evidence now obtained\r\nwill render the fossil peculiarly important to the stratigraphical\r\ngeologist. The detection of characteristic fossils is not quite so\r\nsimple as might be supposed from the above remarks, for examination of\r\nthe position of one fossil will not prove the contemporaneity of beds\r\nin different places, to prove this, all the evidence at our disposal\r\nmust be considered, for reasons which will be presently pointed out.\r\n\r\nAs the result of accumulated knowledge, we can now compile lists of\r\ncharacteristic fossils of the major subdivisions of the strata, which\r\nare of world-wide utility and as our knowledge increases, we are\r\nenabled to subdivide the strata into minor divisions of more than\r\nlocal value.\r\n\r\n_What is a fossil?_ Before discussing the value of fossils as aids to\r\nthe stratigraphical geologist, it may be well to make a few\r\nobservations as to what constitutes a fossil. It is difficult to give\r\nany concise definition, and as is often the case in geology, an\r\nexplanatory paragraph is of more value than a mere definition. The\r\nterm fossil was originally applied to anything dug up from the rocks\r\nof the earth's crust, and was used with reference to inorganic objects\r\nas well as organic remains, for instance minerals were spoken of as\r\nfossils. It is now applied essentially though not exclusively to\r\nrelics of former organisms, though one still reads of fossil\r\nrain-drops, fossil sun-cracks, and so on. Furthermore, the relics need\r\nnot necessarily be parts of the organism, the track of a worm or a\r\nbird's nest if embedded in the strata would be termed a fossil. It is\r\ngenerally agreed that no sharp line can be drawn between recent and\r\nfossil organic remains which is based upon the degree of\r\nmineralisation (or as it was sometimes termed petrifaction) of the\r\nrelics, for many true fossils have not undergone mineralisation,\r\nsubsequent to their entombment.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the name fossil should be applied to\r\norganic remains which have been entombed by some process other than\r\nhuman agency, but this restriction is undesirable. The stone-implement\r\nof the river gravels is as genuine a fossil as the ammonite extracted\r\nfrom the chalk, and the human relics of very recent date may give\r\ninformation of a character quite similar to that supplied by other\r\nremains, for instance, the occurrence of moa-bones in New Zealand in\r\naccumulations below those containing biscuit-tins and jam-pots has\r\nbeen used as a geological argument pointing to the extinction of the\r\nmoa before the arrival of Europeans in New Zealand. The biscuit-tin\r\nhere serves all the purposes of a fossil, and there is no valid reason\r\nwhy it should not be spoken of as such.\r\n\r\nThis statement brings one to consider another method which has been\r\nadopted in order to separate fossil organisms from recent ones,\r\nnamely the time-test. This again is inapplicable, for no line can be\r\ndrawn between the shell which was buried in yesterday's tidal deposit\r\nand that which has lain in the strata through geological ages, and\r\neach may be equally useful to the geologist.\r\n\r\nWhilst, then, we can give no definition of fossil which is likely to\r\nmeet with general acceptance, the term can be so used, as not to give\r\nrise to any doubts as to its meaning, and it is generally applicable\r\nto any organic relics which have been embedded in any deposit or\r\naccumulation by any agent human or otherwise.\r\n\r\n_Mode of occurrence of fossils._ It will not be out of place to say a\r\nfew words as to the way in which fossils are found in strata, as beds\r\nare often inferred to be unfossiliferous, because of ignorance of\r\nmethods which should be pursued in searching for organic relics. It is\r\nunnecessary to dilate upon the actual modes of preservation of\r\norganisms, which is treated of fully in other works. In the first\r\nplace, it is rash to assert that any deposit is unfossiliferous\r\nbecause no fossils have been found in it, even after prolonged search.\r\nThe Llanberis slates had been eagerly searched for fossils for many\r\nyears without result, but that the search was not exhaustive was\r\nproved by the discovery of trilobites in them some years ago. Seekers\r\nafter fossils are rather prone to confine their attention to strata\r\nwhich are already known to be fossiliferous than to pay much attention\r\nto those which have hitherto yielded no organic remains.\r\n\r\nSome kinds of deposits are more often fossiliferous than others.\r\nLimestones which are frequently largely of organic origin, are often\r\nrich in remains, and muddy deposits more frequently furnish fossils\r\nthan those of a purely sandy nature. The difference in the yield is\r\nnot necessarily due to the original inclusion of more remains in one\r\nrock than in another, but is often caused by the obliteration of\r\nformer relics owing to changes which have taken place in the rocks\r\nsubsequently to their deposition. No sedimentary rock must be regarded\r\nas unfossiliferous, however unfitted it appears for the preservation\r\nof fossils. The writer has seen fossils, not only in coarse\r\nconglomerates, rocks which frequently contain no traces of organisms,\r\nbut in deposits composed largely of specular iron ore, and even in\r\nintrusive igneous rocks, though in the latter case, the inclusion of\r\nfossils was due to circumstances which cannot have occurred with\r\nfrequency.\r\n\r\nIn sandy strata, the substance of the fossils has often been\r\ncompletely removed, leaving hollow casts, which may be almost or quite\r\nunrecognisable. In these circumstances, much information may be\r\nobtained by taking impressions of the casts in modelling wax or some\r\nother material. The importance of this process may be judged from the\r\nresults it yielded to Mr Clement Reid in the case of the fossils of\r\nthe Pliocene deposits occurring in pipe-like hollows in the Cretaceous\r\nrocks of Kent and the discovery of the remarkable reptiles described\r\nby Mr E. T. Newton from the Triassic sandstones of Elgin.\r\n\r\nIn argillaceous rocks which have been affected by the processes\r\nproducing cleavage, the fossils may be distorted beyond recognition or\r\nowing to the difficulty of breaking the rocks along the original\r\nplanes of deposition, may remain invisible. Under such circumstances,\r\nsmall nodules of sandy or calcareous nature may sometimes be found\r\nincluded in the argillaceous deposits and may perhaps yield fossils.\r\nOftentimes, also, where the argillaceous rock is in close proximity\r\nto a harder rock, such as massive grit, the argillaceous rock in\r\nclose contiguity to the hard rock may escape the impress of\r\ncleavage-structure, and fossils may be readily extracted from rocks in\r\nthis position when not obtainable from other parts of the deposit. It\r\nwas under these circumstances that the trilobites alluded to above\r\nwere obtained from the Llanberis slates.\r\n\r\nThe fossils of calcareous rocks are often very obvious, but difficult\r\nto extract, as they break across when the rock is fractured. They are\r\nfrequently obtainable in a perfect condition when the rock is\r\nweathered. Occasionally they may be extracted from certain\r\nargillaceous limestones if the limestone be heated to redness, and\r\nsuddenly plunged into cold water. Fossils are often found in a state\r\nwhich enables them to be readily extracted when a limestone is\r\ncoarsely crystalline, though they cannot be extracted in a perfect\r\ncondition when the same limestone is in a different state.\r\n\r\nMany microzoa, which are invisible in rocks, even when viewed through\r\na lens, may be found in microscopic sections of calcareous and\r\nsilicious rocks, and plant structures may be detected under similar\r\ncircumstances in the case of carbonaceous rocks.\r\n\r\nVarious special methods of extracting fossils from rocks have been\r\ndescribed by different writers, many of which are very complex, and\r\nrequire much time. The mechanical action of the sand-blast and the\r\nsolvent action of various acids as hydrochloric and hydrofluosilicic\r\nhave been found of use upon different occasions[11]. The various\r\nprocesses which have been utilised in order to extract and develop\r\nfossils can, however, be best learned by information obtainable from\r\ncurators of palæontological collections, and by actual experience,\r\nand there is yet much information to be acquired as to the manner of\r\nextracting fossils from various kinds of rocks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: For information concerning use of acids see especially\r\nWiman, C. \"Ueber die Graptoliten,\" _Bull. Geol. Inst._, Upsala, No. 4,\r\nvol. II. Part II.]\r\n\r\n_Relative value of fossils to the Stratigraphical Geologist._ It has\r\nbeen hinted above that no general rule as to the relative value of\r\nfossils as guides to the age of strata can be laid down, and that the\r\nascertainment of their relative value is largely the result of actual\r\nexperience. It may be noted, however, that organisms which possess\r\nhard parts are naturally more important to the geologist than those\r\nwhich do not, as few traces of the latter are preserved in the fossil\r\nstate, and even when preserved are usually too obscure to be of much\r\npractical use. Of the organisms which do possess hard parts, different\r\ngroups have been utilised to a different degree, and one group will be\r\nmore or less important than another, according to the use to which it\r\nis applied. Groups of organisms which have a long range in time are\r\nnaturally useful for the identification of large subdivisions of the\r\nstrata, whilst those which have had a shorter range are valuable when\r\nseparating minor subdivisions.\r\n\r\nAgain, as the bulk of the sedimentary deposits has been formed beneath\r\nthe waters of the ocean, relics of marine organisms are naturally more\r\nuseful than those of freshwater ones. Other things being equal, the\r\nmore easily the organism is recognisable, and the more abundant are\r\nits remains, the greater its value to the stratigraphical geologist,\r\nand as the remains of invertebrates are usually found in greater\r\nquantities and in more readily recognisable condition than those of\r\nthe vertebrates, they have been used more extensively as indices of\r\nage. Of the invertebrates, the mollusca are often very abundant, their\r\nremains are adapted for preservation, and their characteristics have\r\nbeen extensively studied, and accordingly they have been and are of\r\ngreat use to the geologist. Of other groups, the graptolites, corals,\r\nechinids, brachiopods, and trilobites have been very largely utilised.\r\nThe Lower Palæozoic strata have been divided into numerous groups,\r\neach characterised by definite forms of graptolites, and a similar use\r\nhas been made of the ammonites in the case of the Mesozoic rocks. It\r\nis not to be inferred that these groups of organisms are naturally\r\nmore useful than other groups, on account of the extent to which they\r\nhave been used; we can merely state that they have been proved to be\r\nuseful as the result of prolonged study; when other groups have\r\nreceived equal attention, they may well be found to be equally useful\r\nfor the purposes which we have in view.\r\n\r\n_Contemporaneity and Homotaxis._ From what has been already stated, it\r\nwill be recognised that the ages of the various fossiliferous rocks of\r\nthe geological column[12] in any one area can be identified with\r\ngreater or less degree of certainty by reference to their included\r\norganisms, the various subdivisions being marked by the possession of\r\ncharacteristic fossils, and it will be naturally and rightly inferred\r\nthat the greater the number of characteristic fossils of any one\r\ndeposit, the more certain is the identification of that deposit. In\r\npractice, geologists are wont to ascertain the age of the strata after\r\nconsideration of all the fossils found therein, some of which may be\r\nactually characteristic whilst many may come up from the strata\r\nbelow, or pass into those above. Having ascertained the order of\r\nsuccession and fossil contents of the strata in various regions, it is\r\nthe task of the geologist to compare the strata of these two regions,\r\nand this task is fraught with considerable difficulty. Much\r\ncontroversy has arisen as to the degree of accuracy with which strata\r\nof remote regions can be correlated, and the subject is one which\r\nrequires full consideration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Although the rocks do not always lie on one another in\r\nregular succession, it is often convenient to speak of them as though\r\nthey did, and as though a column of strata could be carved out in any\r\nregion consisting of horizontal bands of deposit one above another. We\r\nspeak of such an ideal arrangement as constituting a 'geological\r\ncolumn.']\r\n\r\nSuppose that a series of strata which we will call _A_, _B_, and _C_\r\nis found in any one area, each member of which contains characteristic\r\nfossils which enable it to be recognised in that area, and we will\r\nfurther suppose that in another area a series of strata _A´_, _B´_,\r\nand _C´_ is discovered, of which _A´_ has the fauna of _A_ in the\r\nformer area, and similarly _B´_ the fauna of _B_, and _C´_ that of\r\n_C_.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be assumed that the stratum _A_ is therefore contemporaneous\r\nwith _A´_, _B_ with _B´_, and _C_ with _C´_, but on the other hand, it\r\nmust not be assumed that they are not contemporaneous. This is a\r\nstatement which requires some comment. It has been urged that if the\r\ndeposits _A_ and _A´_ in different localities contain the same fauna,\r\nthis is a proof that the two are not contemporaneous, for some time\r\nmust have elapsed in order to allow of the migration of the organisms\r\nfrom one area to another, it being justifiably assumed that they did\r\nnot originate simultaneously in the two areas. But everything depends\r\non the time taken for migration as compared with the period of\r\nexistence of the fauna. If the former was extremely short as compared\r\nwith the latter it may be practically ignored, for we might then speak\r\nof the strata as contemporaneous, just as a historian would rightly\r\nspeak of events in the same way which occurred upon the same\r\nafternoon, though one might have happened an hour before the other.\r\nLet us then glance at the evidence which we have at our disposal,\r\nwhich bears upon this matter.\r\n\r\nThe objection to identification of strata with similar faunas as\r\ncontemporaneous was urged by Whewell, Herbert Spencer, and Huxley, and\r\nthe latter suggested the term Homotaxis or similarity of arrangement\r\nas applicable to groups of strata in different areas, in which a\r\nsimilar succession of faunas was traceable, maintaining that though\r\nnot contemporaneous the strata might be spoken of as homotaxial.\r\nHuxley went so far as to assert that \"for anything that geology or\r\npalæontology are able to show to the contrary, a Devonian fauna and\r\nflora in the British Islands may have been contemporaneous with\r\nSilurian life in North America, and with a Carboniferous fauna and\r\nflora in Africa[13],\" a statement which few if any living geologists\r\nwill endorse. If the statement be true, and the fauna which we speak\r\nof as Devonian, when present be always found (as it is) above that\r\nwhich we in Britain know as Silurian and below that which we term\r\nCarboniferous, the faunas must have originated independently in the\r\nthree centres, and disappeared before the appearance of the next\r\nfauna, or having originated at the same centre, each must have\r\nmigrated in the same direction, spread over the world, and become\r\nextinct as it reached the point or line from which it started. Suppose\r\nfor instance a fauna _A_ originates at the meridian of Greenwich,\r\nmigrates eastward, and dies out again when it once more reaches\r\nGreenwich, that _B_ and _C_ do the same, at a later period, then the\r\nfauna _B_ will always be found above _A_ and _C_ above _B_, but if\r\n_B_ did not become extinct when it reached the Greenwich meridian, it\r\nwould continue its eastward course, and _C_ having in the meantime\r\nstarted on its first round, the fossils of the fauna _B_ would be\r\nfound both above and below those of _C_. It will be shown below that\r\ncases of recurrence do occur, but nowhere do we find a Silurian fauna\r\nabove a Devonian one, or a Devonian one above one belonging to the\r\nCarboniferous, nor is the fauna of a great group of rocks found in one\r\nregion above the fauna of another group, and in another region below\r\nthe same. And this is true not only of the faunas of one major\r\ndivision, such as those of the Silurian and Carboniferous periods, but\r\nalso of the faunas of many minor subdivisions into which the large\r\nones are separated, for instance we do not find the Llandovery fauna\r\nof the Silurian period which in Britain is found below the Wenlock\r\nfauna embedded elsewhere in strata above the Wenlock. I have\r\nsimplified the statement by assuming that the faunas are identical in\r\nthe different localities, and exactly similar throughout the whole\r\nthickness of the containing strata, which is naturally not the case,\r\nbut the additional complexity does not conceal the truth of what has\r\nbeen stated. In the absence of actual inversion of well-marked faunas,\r\nonly one explanation is possible, namely, that the time for migration\r\nof forms is so short as compared with the entire period during which\r\nthe forms existed, that it may be practically ignored, and the strata\r\ncontaining similar faunas may be therefore spoken of truthfully as\r\ncontemporaneous and not merely homotaxial[14].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Huxley, T. H. \"Geological Contemporaneity and Persistent\r\nTypes of Life,\" being the Anniversary Address to the Geological\r\nSociety for 1862; reprinted in _Lay Sermons, Addresses and Reviews_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: For fuller discussion of this matter see a paper by the\r\nAuthor 'On Homotaxis,' _Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc._, vol. VI. Part II. p.\r\n74.]\r\n\r\n_Apparent anomalies in the distribution of fossils._ There are several\r\noccurrences which have tended to augment the distrust frequently felt\r\nconcerning the value of fossils as indices of the age of the beds in\r\nwhich they occur, which may be here considered.\r\n\r\nThough the greater number of fossil remains belonged to organisms\r\nwhich lived during the time of accumulation of the deposits in which\r\nthey are now embedded, this is by no means universally the case, and\r\nthe occurrence of _remanié_ fossils, which have been derived from\r\ndeposits more ancient than the ones in which they are now found is far\r\nfrom being a rare event. The existence of remains of this nature in\r\nthe superficial drifts and river-gravels of our own country has long\r\nbeen recognised, and no one would suppose that the _Gryphæa_ and other\r\nshells furnished by these gravels had lived contemporaneously with the\r\nspecies of _Corbicula_, _Unio_ and other molluscs which are part of\r\nthe true fauna of the gravels. In this case the water-worn nature of\r\nthe remains is a good index to their origin, but in other cases, it is\r\nby no means an infallible guide, for we sometimes find on the one hand\r\nthat remains of organisms proper to the deposits in which they occur\r\nare water-worn, whilst on the other the relics of _remanié_ fossils\r\nare not. The now well-known gault fossils of the Cambridge Greensand\r\nat the base of the chalk were not always recognised as having been\r\nderived from older beds, and there are certain fossils found in\r\nnodules in the Cretaceous rocks of Lincolnshire, which still form a\r\nsubject for difference of opinion, for while some writers maintain\r\nthat they belong to the deposits in which they are now found, others\r\nsuppose that the nodules have been washed out of earlier beds.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we find forms which occurring in a set of beds _A_ in an\r\narea, are absent from the overlying beds _B_, and appear again in the\r\nsucceeding deposits _C_. Such cases of _recurrence_ are by no means\r\nrare, though many supposed instances of recurrence have been recorded\r\nas the result of stratigraphical or palæontological errors. The best\r\nexamples have been noted by Barrande among the Lower Palæozoic\r\ndeposits of Bohemia. The stage _D_ of Bohemia consists of five\r\n'bandes' or subdivisions, the lowest (_d_ 1), central (_d_ 3) and\r\nuppermost (_d_ 5) divisions are mainly argillaceous, whilst the second\r\n(_d_ 2) and fourth (_d_ 4) are essentially arenaceous. Some of the\r\nforms found in _d_ 1, _d_ 3 and _d_ 5 have not been found in _d_ 2 and\r\n_d_ 4. The best-known example is the trilobite _Æglina rediviva_. It\r\nis clear that this and other forms did not become extinct during the\r\ndeposition of the strata of _d_ 2 and _d_ 4, though they may have\r\ndisappeared temporarily from the Bohemian area, or else lingered on in\r\nsuch diminished numbers that their remains have not been discovered.\r\nThe range of the organism is in fact right through the deposits of the\r\nstage _D_, and the discontinuity of distribution is not a real\r\nanomaly; it may be compared to some extent with cases of discontinuous\r\ndistribution in space. It is needless to remark that the whole fauna\r\ndoes not disappear for a time and then reappear, but only a few out of\r\nthe many forms which compose it. The comparative rarity of examples of\r\nrecurrence after long intervals is an indication that the\r\npalæontological record as it is termed is not so imperfect as some\r\nsuppose, for if our knowledge of fossils were very imperfect, we\r\nshould expect cases of apparent recurrence to be common, as the result\r\nof the non-detection of fossils in the intermediate beds. One of the\r\nmost marked cases of apparent recurrence known some years ago was the\r\nreappearance of a genus of trilobite _Ampyx_ in Ludlow rocks, found in\r\nthe Bala rocks, but not in the Llandovery or Wenlock strata. It has\r\nsince been discovered in Llandovery beds, and its eventual discovery\r\nin beds of Wenlock age may be regarded as certain. A supposed case of\r\nrecurrence which would have been remarkable, that of the disappearance\r\nof _Phillipsia_ in Ordovician rocks, its entire absence in those of\r\nSilurian age, and its reappearance in the Devonian, has broken down,\r\nfor the supposed Ordovician form has been shown to belong to an\r\nentirely different group of trilobites from that containing the genus\r\n_Phillipsia_, and it has been therefore renamed _Phillipsinella_.\r\n\r\nMany apparent anomalies of distribution have been explained as due to\r\nmigration, but it is doubtful whether any one of these supposed\r\nanomalies is actual and not due to errors in determining the position\r\nof the beds or the nature of their included fossils. Some of the\r\nsupposed anomalies have already been shown to be due to error, and the\r\nothers will almost certainly be cleared up. In speaking of anomalies\r\nof distribution, the geologist can only be guided by experience as to\r\nwhat constitutes an anomaly. For instance the existence of a complete\r\nfauna in any one place in the beds of a system above that to which it\r\nis elsewhere confined would be regarded as anomalous and as probably\r\ndue to error, whilst the reappearance of several forms in beds of a\r\nsystem higher than that in which they had hitherto been found, could\r\nhardly be considered as an anomaly. A geologist would suspect the\r\nstatement that after the disappearance of an Ordovician fauna in an\r\narea and its replacement by a Silurian fauna, the Ordovician fauna\r\nreappeared for a time, but would not regard the statement that a\r\nCenomanian fauna partly reappeared in the Chalk Rock with surprise.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a Silurian fauna in Ordovician times was maintained\r\nby Barrande in the case of the Bohemian basin. Lenticular patches of\r\nSilurian rocks having the lithological characters of the Silurian\r\nstrata are found in the Ordovician beds of that region, and they\r\ncontain fossils specifically identical with those of the Silurian\r\nrocks. Barrande explained this appearance as due to the existence of a\r\nfauna in other regions resembling the Silurian fauna of Bohemia,\r\nduring the Ordovician period, when the normal Ordovician fauna of\r\nBohemia inhabited that area. He supposed that in parts of the basin,\r\nwhen favourable conditions arose, _colonies_ of the foreign fauna\r\nsettled for a time, but did not get a permanent footing in the basin\r\nuntil the commencement of Silurian times. The theory of colonies has\r\nnow been rejected for the Bohemian area, and the phenomena shown to be\r\ndue to repetition of strata by folding and faulting, but it is a\r\ntheory which is again and again advocated in order to explain\r\napparently anomalous phenomena in other areas, and these apparent\r\nanomalies which are so explained, must be regarded with grave\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nThe various complexities alluded to in the foregoing pages increase\r\nthe difficulty experienced by the geologist in correlating strata in\r\ndifferent areas by their included organisms, but no one of them\r\ndisproves the possibility of making these correlations, which can be\r\ncarried on to a greater or less extent according to the nature of the\r\nfaunas.\r\n\r\nA good deal of misconception has arisen concerning the geographical\r\ndistribution of former faunas, owing to the tendency to compare them\r\nexclusively with the littoral faunas of the present day. These\r\nlittoral faunas have a comparatively limited geographical\r\ndistribution, the forms of one marine province often differing\r\nconsiderably from those of an adjoining one, and still more widely\r\nfrom one which is remote, so that anyone confronted with the relics\r\nof faunas from the existing Australian and European seas, would find\r\nno indications furnished by identity of species that the faunas were\r\ncontemporaneous. Recent researches have shown, however, that the\r\ncreatures whose remains are deposited at some distance from the\r\ncoast-line have a much stronger resemblance to one another than the\r\nlittoral organisms have, if the fauna of two distant areas be\r\ncompared. It is still a moot point which will be discussed in a later\r\nchapter, how far the deep-sea deposits of modern times are represented\r\namongst the strata of the geological column by deposits of similar\r\norigin. But it is certain that many of the ancient strata are not\r\nlittoral deposits, and it will be found that it is by comparison of\r\nthe faunas of the deeper-water deposits that the geologist correlates\r\nthe strata of remote regions: where shallow water deposits are formed,\r\nthe faunas differ markedly in different regions, and these\r\nshallow-water forms can only be correlated owing to their occurrence\r\nbetween deeper-water strata. Thus if strata _A_, _B_ and _C_ be found\r\nin one area, and the fauna of _A_ and _C_ are deep-water forms, those\r\nof _B_ being shallow-water forms, and in another area beds _A´_\r\ncontain the same fauna as _A_, and _C´_ the same fauna as _C_ whilst\r\nthe fauna of _B´_ is different from that of _B_, we can nevertheless\r\ncorrelate the strata _B_ and _B´_ (if they be conformable with the\r\nunderlying and overlying beds), because of the identity of age of the\r\nassociated beds in the two areas. It will possibly be found that the\r\nstrata _A_ and _C_ can be further subdivided into _A_{1}_, _A_{2}_,\r\n... &c. _C_{1}_, _C_{2}_, ... by the existence of minor faunas, which\r\nare comparable in the two cases, but such subdivisions may not be\r\nestablished in the case of the beds _B_ and _B´_.\r\n\r\nTo take actual examples:--The Llandovery beds of Dumfriesshire can be\r\nsubdivided into several minor divisions each of which can be\r\nrecognised in the Lake District of England, and to a large extent in\r\nScandinavia and elsewhere, for the deposits in these areas are of\r\ndeep-water character, and the sub-faunas of the subdivisions are\r\nsimilar in the different areas, but the Llandovery rocks of the Welsh\r\nborderland are shallow-water deposits, with a different fauna from\r\nthat of the deep-water deposits of this age, and can only be stated to\r\nbe contemporaneous with the Llandovery rocks elsewhere, because the\r\ndeeper-water faunas of the underlying Bala rocks and overlying Wenlock\r\nrocks of the Welsh borders are respectively similar to those of the\r\nBala and Wenlock rocks of the other regions. The shallow-water\r\nLlandoveries of the Welsh borders have only been separated into two\r\ndivisions, upper and lower, and have not been split up into a number\r\nof subdivisions, each characterised by a sub-fauna, and each\r\ncomparable with one of the subdivisions of Dumfriesshire, Lakeland and\r\nthe other regions where the deep-water facies is found.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that though the principle of William Smith that strata\r\ncan be recognised by their included organisms has been extended since\r\nhis time, and shown to apply to far smaller subdivisions of the strata\r\nthan was suspected, the method of application is the same, and is more\r\nor less successful according to the amount of evidence which is\r\naccumulated in support of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF CLASSIFICATION OF THE STRATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarth-history like human history is the record of an unbroken chain of\r\nevents. The agents which have produced geological phenomena have been\r\nin operation since the earth came into existence. Accordingly a\r\nperfect earth-history would be written as a continuous narrative, just\r\nas would a complete history of the human race. The historian of man\r\nfinds it not only convenient but necessary to divide the epoch of\r\nwhich he is writing into periods of time, and so does the geologist,\r\nand in each case the division is necessarily more or less arbitrary.\r\nIt is true that in writing the history or geology of a country, marked\r\nevents stand out which form a convenient means of making divisions,\r\nbut the marked events occurring in one country are not likely to take\r\nplace simultaneously with those of another country, and consequently a\r\nclassification of this character is only locally applicable.\r\n\r\nThe classification which is at present used by geologists was\r\noriginally founded upon definite principles, and although our\r\nprinciples of classification have, as will appear, been somewhat\r\naltered subsequently, it has been found more convenient to modify the\r\noriginal classification than to adopt a new one in its entirety.\r\n\r\nThe largest divisions into which the strata of the geological column\r\nwere separated were instituted because of the supposed extinction of\r\nfaunas, and sudden or rapid replacement by other faunas of an entirely\r\ndifferent character. This supposed rapid extinction and replacement is\r\nnow known to have been only apparent and due to observation in\r\nrestricted areas, and it is doubtful whether the three great divisions\r\nfounded upon them are not rather mischievous than useful, as tending\r\nto disseminate wrong notions.\r\n\r\nMoreover there is considerable diversity of opinion as to the terms to\r\nbe adopted. The rocks were formerly divided into Primary, Secondary,\r\nand Tertiary. Owing chiefly to the use of the term Primary in another\r\nsense, the alternative titles Palæozoic, Mesozoic and Cainozoic (or\r\nCænozoic) were suggested, and though the term Primary has been\r\ndefinitely abandoned in favour of Palæozoic, the words Secondary and\r\nTertiary are used extensively as synonyms of Mesozoic and Cainozoic.\r\nIt was soon perceived that the period of time included in the\r\nPalæozoic age was much longer than the combined periods of Secondary\r\nand Tertiary ages, and it was proposed to group the latter under one\r\ntitle Neozoic, whilst another suggestion was to split the Palæozoic\r\nage into an earlier Proterozoic and later Deuterozoic division. The\r\ninterest excited by the advent of man is probably the cause of the\r\nattempt to establish a Quaternary division, which some hold to be a\r\nminor subdivision of the Tertiary, whilst others would separate it\r\naltogether. The terms Palæozoic, Mesozoic (or Secondary) and Cainozoic\r\n(or Tertiary) are now used so generally that any attempt to abolish\r\nthem would be doomed to failure, but it must be remembered that they\r\nare purely arbitrary expressions, and the other terms which are not in\r\ngeneral use, might be dropped with advantage.\r\n\r\nThe other subdivisions have been used somewhat loosely, and although\r\nan attempt has been made by the International Geological Congress to\r\nrestrict certain names to subdivisions of varying degrees of value, it\r\nwill probably be found best to allow of a certain elasticity in the\r\nuse of terms, merely agreeing that they shall be used as nearly as\r\npossible with the signification assigned to them by the Congress.\r\nAccording to this classification, and apart from the division into\r\nPalæozoic, Mesozoic and Cainozoic, the strata of the geological column\r\nare grouped into _Systems_, which are subdivided into _Series_, and\r\nthe series are further split up into _Stages_. A number of\r\nchronological terms were also suggested, of equivalent importance,\r\nthus the beds of a _system_ would be deposited during a _Period_,\r\nthose of a _series_ during an _Epoch_, and those of a _stage_ during\r\nan _Age_[15].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: The chronological words have been used so loosely that\r\nit is doubtful whether any good will come of trying to restrict their\r\nuse, and Sir A. Geikie has pointed out the confusion which would arise\r\nif the term _group_ be employed for the largest divisions (Palæozoic,\r\n&c.). The terms _System_, _Series_ and _Stage_ may well be employed in\r\nthe senses suggested by the Congress.]\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the Geological Column were originally divided into\r\nsystems, owing to the occurrence of marked physical and\r\npalæontological breaks between the rocks of two adjacent systems,\r\nexcept in cases where a complete change occurred locally in the\r\nlithological characters of the rocks of two systems which were in\r\njuxtaposition: it is necessary to consider for awhile the nature of\r\nthese breaks.\r\n\r\nThe most apparent physical break is where the rocks of one set of\r\ndeposits rest unconformably upon the rocks of another one, indicating\r\nthat the older set has been uplifted and to some extent eroded before\r\nthe deposition of the strata of the newer set. This uplift and erosion\r\nsignifies a change from oceanic to continental conditions in the area\r\nin which unconformity is found on a large scale, and accordingly a\r\nlong period of time would elapse during which the continental surface\r\nwould not receive deposits, so that the highest rocks of the\r\nunderlying system would be considerably older than the lowest rocks of\r\nthe one which succeeds it. Such a break may be obviously utilised for\r\npurposes of classification, but as some areas of the earth's surface\r\nmust have been occupied by the waters of the ocean when other regions\r\nformed land, deposit in some areas must constantly have occurred\r\nsimultaneously with denudation in others, and any classification\r\nfounded upon the existence of unconformities will therefore have a\r\npurely local value.\r\n\r\nAnother, and less apparent physical break, which will also be locally\r\napplicable, may be due to the depression of an area to so great a\r\ndepth that little or no deposit was formed upon the ocean floor there\r\nduring the period of great depression; but as a break of this\r\ncharacter is difficult to detect, the existence of unconformities has\r\nalone been practically utilised as a means of separating strata into\r\nsystems owing to marked physical change, except in the cases where the\r\nlithological character of the strata completely changes, as between\r\nthe Triassic and Jurassic rocks of England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nPalæontological breaks or breaks in the succession of organisms are in\r\nmany cases, the result of physical breaks, and accordingly it is often\r\npossible to separate one set of strata from another by the existence\r\nof a combined physical and palæontological break between them. It is\r\nby no means necessary however that a physical break should be\r\naccompanied by a break in succession of the organisms, and the latter\r\nmay also occur without the former. It was once maintained that a\r\npalæontological break was due to the complete and sudden extinction of\r\na fauna and its entire replacement by a new one, but this is far from\r\ntrue, and accordingly the breaks differ in degree. Study of the strata\r\nshows that when the succession is not to any extent interrupted, the\r\nspecies do not appear simultaneously, but come in at different\r\nhorizons, and they disappear in the same way. In Figure 2 let _A_\r\nrepresent a set of conformable strata _ab ... k_, and suppose the\r\nvertical lines represent the ranges of the various species found in\r\nthese strata. It will be seen that of 27 species whose range is shown\r\nonly 2 pass through the whole thickness, so that the fauna of _k_ is\r\nvery different from the fauna of _a_, nevertheless the fauna of each\r\nstratum is closely similar to that of the underlying as well as to\r\nthat of the overlying stratum, and though most of the species of _k_\r\nare different from those of _a_, this need not be the case with the\r\ngenera. The fauna of the set of strata would contain every species\r\nwhose range is represented, and for convenience' sake it might be said\r\nto be composed of sub-faunas, one of which occurs in each division\r\n_ab_ ..., but the separation into sub-faunas would be artificial and\r\nmerely for convenience' sake, for there is no break between any two\r\nsub-faunas. Turning now to _B_ (Fig. 2), an attempt is made there to\r\nshow what happens when there has been a physical break, resulting in\r\nthe denudation of the strata _ghik_, and the deposition of another set\r\n_op_ ... unconformably upon those deposits of the earlier set which\r\nhave not been denuded. As the result of this we note, first, that the\r\nrelics of organisms which existed in the area during the deposition of\r\n_ghik_, and were entombed in those strata, are destroyed by the\r\nprocesses of denudation, and a large number of organisms which lived\r\nlong after the deposition of _f_, and disappeared not simultaneously\r\nbut at different times during the period when denudation was in\r\noperation, seem to become extinct simultaneously at the top of _f_,\r\nthough, if we could visit an area which was receiving sediment during\r\nthe period of denudation, we should find them dying out in the rocks\r\nof that region at different levels. Furthermore, whilst denudation is\r\ngoing on, a longer or shorter period of time elapses, during which the\r\nupheaved area receives no deposit, and accordingly no organisms which\r\nlived during that period are preserved in the upheaved area. During\r\nthis time a set of deposits _lmn_ may have been laid down elsewhere,\r\nand besides the gradual disappearance of some of the organisms of _ab\r\n... k_, there will have been a gradual appearance of new species.\r\nWhen the upheaved area is once more submerged, a new set of deposits\r\n_op_ ... is accumulated in it, and the species which gradually\r\nappeared in adjoining regions will now migrate to it, and will seem to\r\ncome in simultaneously at the bottom of _o_; accordingly we may find\r\nthat there is not a single species which passes through from _f_ to\r\n_o_ and the palæontological break in this area is complete, though it\r\nis clear that it only implies local change, and that we may and indeed\r\nmust find intermediate forms in other regions which fill up the gap.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the local character of a palæontological break\r\nwe may cite the case of the Carboniferous and Permian systems of\r\nBritain. These rocks are separated from one another in our area by a\r\nphysical and palæontological break, but in parts of India, and other\r\nplaces, we find a group of rocks now known as the Permo-Carboniferous\r\nrocks which contain a fauna intermediate in character between those of\r\nthe Permian and Carboniferous systems, and a study of this fauna shows\r\nthat the hiatus which exists locally is filled by the species\r\ncontained in the Permo-Carboniferous rocks.\r\n\r\nA palæontological break may, like a physical one, result from\r\ndepression of the ocean-floor to so great a depth, that no organisms\r\nare preserved there during the period of great depression, and the\r\nremarks made concerning a depression of this nature when speaking of\r\nphysical breaks will apply here also.\r\n\r\nA local palæontological break may result owing to physical changes\r\nwithout the production of an unconformity in the area, or its\r\nsubmergence to a great depth, or if an unconformity is found, the\r\nbreak may be more marked owing to other physical changes. The\r\ndifference between the Upper and Lower Carboniferous faunas is very\r\nmarked in England, where the Upper Carboniferous beds were deposited\r\nunder physical conditions different from those of the Lower\r\nCarboniferous, and accordingly the corals, crinoids and other\r\nopen-water animals which flourished in Lower Carboniferous times are\r\nrare or altogether absent in the higher rocks. Where the change of\r\nconditions did not occur to a great extent as in parts of Spain and\r\nNorth America, the similarity between the two faunas is much more\r\npronounced. Again, there is an unconformity between the Cretaceous and\r\nEocene beds of England, which is accompanied by a palæontological\r\nbreak, but this break is more pronounced owing to difference of\r\nphysical conditions, for we find abundance of gastropods in the lower\r\nTertiary beds, and a rarity of these shells at the top of the chalk of\r\nEngland, though where physical conditions were favourable for the\r\ngrowth of gastropods, their shells are found in the higher strata of\r\nchalk age, and the palæontological break is not so apparent.\r\n\r\nA palæontological break may occur also as the result of climatic\r\nchange, though actual instances of this occurrence are much more\r\ndifficult to detect owing to the general absence of any evidence of\r\nclimatic change other than that supplied by the organisms themselves.\r\nStill, when no physical break exists, and the lithological characters\r\nof a group of sediments remain constant throughout, indicating the\r\nprevalence of similar physical conditions through the period of\r\ndeposition of the sediments, if the fauna suddenly changes, there must\r\nhave been cause for the change, and in the absence of any other cause\r\nwhich is likely to produce the change, alteration of the character of\r\nthe climate may be suspected.\r\n\r\nIt follows from the observations which have been made, that although\r\nthe rocks of the Geological Column may be divided into systems owing\r\nto the existence of physical and palæontological breaks, and this\r\nclassification may be and has been applied generally, the line of\r\ndemarcation between the rocks of two systems will be a purely\r\nconventional one, where there is no break, and, to avoid confusion,\r\nthat line when once drawn should be adopted by everyone, unless good\r\ncause can be shown for its abandonment.\r\n\r\nThe subdivision of systems into series has been conducted in a manner\r\ngenerally similar to that in which large masses of strata have been\r\ngrouped into systems, with the exception that actual breaks need not\r\noccur. The subdivision was usually made on account of marked\r\ndifferences in the lithological characters or fossil contents of the\r\nrocks of the various series, and frequently the lithological\r\ncharacters as well as the fossil contents are dissimilar; taking the\r\nrocks of the Silurian system of the typical Silurian area as an\r\nexample, we find the Llandovery rocks largely arenaceous, the Wenlock\r\nrocks largely calcareo-argillaceous, and the Ludlow rocks\r\nargillaceo-arenaceous, whilst the fauna of the Wenlock rocks differs\r\nfrom that of the Llandovery rocks below and also from that of the\r\nLudlow rocks above. The Llandovery, Wenlock and Ludlow therefore\r\nconstitute three series of the Silurian system, but the lines of\r\ndemarcation between these series are nevertheless conventional, for it\r\nhas been suggested that a more natural division, as far as the British\r\nrocks are concerned, could be made by drawing a line, not as at\r\npresent at the base of the Ludlow, but in the middle of that series as\r\nnow defined, and uniting the Lower Ludlow beds with the Wenlock strata\r\nto form a single series.\r\n\r\nThe same process as that adopted in the case of series has been\r\nessentially pursued in subdividing these into stages. Each stage is\r\nusually different from that above and below in its lithological\r\ncharacters, fossil contents, or both, though the difference is usually\r\nless in degree than that which has been utilised for the demarcation\r\nof series. A stage is often, though not always, composed of deposits\r\nof one kind of sediment, and is furthermore frequently characterised\r\nby the possession of one or, it may be, two, three or more\r\ncharacteristic fossils. Thus the Wenlock series is divided in the\r\ntypical area into Woolhope limestone, Wenlock shale, and Wenlock\r\nlimestone, and the very names given to these stages indicate that each\r\nis largely composed of one kind of material. Their fossils are also to\r\nsome extent different, though the difference between them is not\r\nlikely to be of so marked a nature as that which exists between the\r\nfaunas of separate series.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the system differs from the series and the series\r\nfrom the stage in degree rather than in kind, and no hard line can be\r\ndrawn between divisions of different degrees of magnitude. It follows\r\ntherefore that frequently a mass of sediment which one author will\r\nconsider sufficiently important to constitute a system will be defined\r\nby another as a series, and similarly a series of one writer may\r\nbecome a stage of another.\r\n\r\nThe student of Stratigraphical Geology will find the expression\r\n'fossil zone' occurring over and over again in geological literature,\r\nand as the term has been used somewhat vaguely by many writers and is\r\napt to be misunderstood, it will be useful to notice the expression at\r\nsome length.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking the term zone (a belt or girdle), when applied to\r\ndistribution of fossils, should refer to the belt of strata through\r\nwhich a fossil or group of fossils ranges. Generally speaking, the\r\nexpression is used in connexion with one fossil; thus we speak of the\r\nzone of _Coenograptus gracilis_, the zone of _Cidaris florigemma_ and\r\nthe zone of _Belemnites jaculum_, though sometimes it is used with\r\nreference to more than one species, as the zone of Micrasters and the\r\n_Olenellus_ zone. The term has been used not of a belt of strata but\r\nof a group of organisms[16], and zones defined as \"assemblages of\r\norganic remains of which one abundant and characteristic form is\r\nchosen as an index,\" but if it be agreed that the term should be\r\napplied to strata and not to organisms this might be modified and the\r\ndefinition run:--'Zones are belts of strata, each of which is\r\ncharacterised by an assemblage of organic remains of which one\r\nabundant and characteristic form is chosen as an index.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: See H. B. Woodward, \"On Geological Zones,\" _Proc. Geol.\r\nAssoc._, vol. XII. Part 7, p. 295, and vol. XII. Part 8, p. 313.]\r\n\r\nIt has been objected that the subdivision of strata into zones has\r\nbeen pushed too far, but this is merely because in the establishment\r\nof zones, workers find it easier to work out the successive zones\r\nwhere the strata are thin and presumably deposited with extreme\r\nslowness, than where they are much thicker and have been rapidly\r\naccumulated, and accordingly, as the subdivision of strata into zones\r\nis a recent event, geological literature contains many more references\r\nto thin zones than to those of great thickness. Where an abundant and\r\ncharacteristic form (which is chosen as an index) of an assemblage of\r\norganic remains ranges through a great thickness of deposit, there is\r\nno objection to speaking of the whole as a zone, and it cannot be\r\ndivided. To give some idea of the variations in the thickness of\r\nstrata through which these abundant and characteristic forms will\r\nrange, I append a list of the zones of graptolites which have been\r\nestablished amongst the Silurian rocks of English Lakeland and the\r\nthickness of each (which in the case of the thicker deposits is\r\nnaturally only approximate):--\r\n\r\n                                         Thickness.\r\n             Zone of                  Feet.

A comprehensive\r\nview of the characters of a system was taken, and accordingly the\r\nlines of demarcation between the same systems adopted by workers in\r\ndifferent countries were by no means necessarily at or near the same\r\ngeological horizon. As the result of more recent work, the\r\nestablishment of fossil zones has been growing apace, and though many\r\nof these are seen to have only local significance, it is found as the\r\nresult of experience that many of them are widely spread and occur in\r\nthe same order in different localities; accordingly the remarks that\r\nhave been made concerning the contemporaneity of strata apply to these\r\nzones also. After a study of this kind, a much more accurate\r\ncomparison of strata is possible, and correlation of strata can be\r\ncarried on to a much greater extent than when the systems were only\r\nroughly subdivided by reference to breaks, differences of lithological\r\ncharacter, and general comparison of the faunas; accordingly whilst\r\nlargely retaining the old names, the old method of classification is\r\nbeing partly superseded, and the included faunas alone are utilised to\r\nestablish accurate correlations of the strata in various parts of the\r\nworld. How far this correlation can be carried on remains to be seen,\r\nfor the work though well advanced has by no means reached completion,\r\nand predictions as to the ultimate issue are useless without the\r\nexperience by means of which only the work can be done. The difference\r\nbetween the methods of classification is well shown by an examination\r\nof the old and new divisions of the chalk. It was formerly roughly\r\ndivided mainly by lithological characters into Chalk Marl, Lower Chalk\r\nwithout flints, Middle Chalk with few flints and Upper Chalk with many\r\nflints, but no two observers would probably agree as to where the\r\ndeposit with few flints ceased and that with many commenced. The chalk\r\nis now separated on palæontological grounds into Cenomanian, Turonian,\r\nSenonian and Danian, and the superiority of the new method to the old\r\nis practically shown by the abandonment of the old classification\r\nexcept for very rough purposes, and the general acceptance of the new\r\none. Many other examples might be given, but this one will suffice. In\r\nthe case of some of the systems, the Carboniferous for example, the\r\nold classification founded upon lithological characters is largely\r\nextant, and it has been inferred therefore that no accurate\r\nsubdivisions of the Carboniferous rocks can be made by reference to\r\nthe faunas, owing to the rapidity with which the deposits were\r\naccumulated. It is by no means certain because the work has not been\r\ndone that it cannot be done, and the experience obtained from a study\r\nof other strata in which subdivisions have been established by\r\nreference to the fauna would lead one to suppose that the\r\nnon-establishment of subdivisions of the Carboniferous strata is due\r\nto our want of knowledge rather than to their non-existence.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a classification on palæontological lines by no\r\nmeans does away with the necessity for local classifications on a\r\nlithological basis, and it has already been remarked that important\r\nresults will follow from a comparison of the classifications of\r\nsediments founded on the two lines, results which have hitherto\r\nlargely escaped our attention owing to the existence of a cumbrous\r\nclassification attained by the application sometimes of one method, at\r\nother times of the alternative one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSIMULATION OF STRUCTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough it is easy to give an account of the structures which are of\r\nimportance to the student of the stratified rocks, actual observation\r\nof these structures is frequently attended with difficulties owing to\r\nthe close imitation of one structure by another, and the past history\r\nof the science shows that erroneous conclusions have been reached\r\nagain and again on account of the incorrect interpretation of\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nSimulation of organisms has frequently been the cause of error.\r\nInorganic substances take on the form of organisms with various\r\ndegrees of closeness. The dendritic markings produced by\r\nefflorescences of oxide of manganese are familiar to all, and as the\r\nname implies, they simulate, to some extent, plant remains. More\r\ncomplex chemical changes have resulted in the production of\r\nrock-masses in which, not the outward form alone but, the internal\r\nstructure of organisms is reproduced with more or less approach to\r\nfidelity, as the rocks which contain the supposed organisms described\r\nas _Eozoon bohemicum_, _E. bavaricum_, and, we may add, _E.\r\ncanadense_. Mechanical changes in rocks subsequent to their formation\r\nmay also cause the simulation of organisms by inorganic substances.\r\nProf. Sollas has given reasons for considering the structure\r\ndescribed as _Oldhamia_ to be inorganic, and in the Carboniferous\r\nSandstones of Little Haven, Pembrokeshire, every stage in the\r\nformation of tubular bodies resembling worm-tubes, as the result of\r\ncomplex folding of the strata, may be observed, whilst in other cases\r\nwe find imitation of worm-tracks, as has been observed before.\r\n\r\nIt is when one inorganic structure is simulated by another that the\r\nstratigraphical geologist is most likely to be led astray, and\r\naccordingly it is worth noting some cases where this has occurred, as\r\na warning, for it must not be supposed that the cases here noted are\r\nthe only ones which are likely to occur.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that the existence of bedding-planes is of prime\r\nimportance to the geologist, and their detection is a matter of\r\nsupreme moment. Under ordinary circumstances there is no great\r\ndifficulty in distinguishing bedding-planes from other planes, but the\r\nimportance of discovering them is often greatest when the difficulty\r\nis most pronounced. In rocks which have undergone no great amount of\r\ndisturbance the planes of stratification are often marked by their\r\nregular parallelism, the separation of layers having different\r\nlithological characters by these planes, the arrangement of the longer\r\naxes of pebbles parallel to them, and the occurrence of fossils and\r\nalso of rain-prints, ripple-marks and other structures produced during\r\ndeposition, upon the surfaces of the strata, but none of these\r\nappearances is necessarily conclusive, especially in areas where the\r\nrocks have been subjected to orogenic movements. In regularly-jointed\r\nrocks, jointing may well be mistaken for bedding, and there is often\r\ngreat difficulty in discriminating between bedding and cleavage,\r\nespecially when the exposures of rock are of small extent. Fossils may\r\nbe dragged out along planes at an angle to the true bedding, pebbles\r\nwill be compressed by cleavage so that their longer axes do not remain\r\nparallel to the bedding-planes but now lie parallel to the\r\nsuperinduced planes of cleavage, and a structure closely resembling\r\n'ripple-mark' may be produced on planes other than those of original\r\nbedding, as the result of puckering. The alternation of rocks having\r\ndifferent lithological characters may also be misleading. Intrusion of\r\ndykes along cleavage-planes, followed by decomposition of the\r\ndyke-rock causing it to resemble a sediment, and formation of mineral\r\nveins along the same planes, may give rise to an apparent succession\r\nof rocks of different lithological characters which could easily\r\nmislead an observer and cause him to mistake the cleavage-planes for\r\nplanes of stratification. In rocks which have undergone great lateral\r\npressure, the beds of different lithological character may be folded\r\nin such a way as to give very erroneous ideas of the true dip of the\r\nrock on a large scale. In Fig. 3 the dip of the rocks in a small\r\nexposure might appear to be in the direction indicated by the\r\nunfeathered arrow, whilst the true dip of the strata as a whole,\r\nleaving the minor foldings out of account, is in the direction of the\r\nfeathered arrow, at the inclination represented by the dotted line.\r\nThe minor folds in a case like that represented may extend upwards for\r\nscores or even hundreds of feet, so that an error as to the direction\r\nand amount of dip may be made, even if the observer faces a cliff of\r\nconsiderable height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nFalse-bedding on a large scale may be a cause of error. In the Penrith\r\nSandstone of Cumberland, the planes of deposition are often found\r\ndipping in one direction in a large quarry, but inspection of a wider\r\narea shows that this is not the true dip of the beds as a whole, but\r\nmerely a local dip due to deposition on a slope, and any one\r\nattempting to calculate the total thickness of the beds by reference\r\nto these divisional planes might be seriously led astray. A reference\r\nto Fig. 4 will explain this. The lines _AA´_, _BB´_ are the true\r\nbedding-planes cut across in the section, whilst the lines sloping to\r\nthe right from _xx_ are only lines of false-bedding on a large scale.\r\nAn exaggerated estimate of the thickness of the deposit would be made\r\nby measuring the thickness of each of these stratula from _A_ to _A´_\r\nand adding these thicknesses together, whereas the actual thickness of\r\nthe middle bed is the distance between _A_ and _B_ or _A´_ and _B´_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nWhen rocks have been affected by thrust-planes, the simulation of\r\nbedding may be carried out to a very full extent. Not only do the\r\nmajor thrust-planes resemble bedding-planes but the minor thrusts\r\nproduce an appearance of divisional planes separating stratula or\r\nlaminæ, and a close approximation to false-bedding is the result. To\r\nthis structure Prof. Bonney has given the name\r\n'pseudo-stromatism[17].' It may be developed in rocks of all kinds,\r\nwhether possessing original planes of stratification or not, and as a\r\nresult of its existence the geologist may be seriously misled, not\r\nmerely by mistaking the direction of the strata, but also the nature\r\nof the rock, for we may find it produced in an unstratified glacial\r\ntill, and in a massive igneous rock, and in each case the resulting\r\nrock will resemble a sedimentary deposit, and of course the observer\r\nmay be confirmed in his erroneous opinion by the formation of apparent\r\nfossils, ripple-marks or other objects which he might expect to\r\ndiscover in sediments. As illustrative examples, reference may be made\r\nto a number of schistose rocks, in which the planes of discontinuity\r\n(which are in truth planes of foliation) have been taken for\r\nbedding-planes and the rocks claimed as sedimentary though they are in\r\nreality igneous; for instance many of the rocks of the Laurentian of\r\nCanada, of the Hebridean of the North West Highlands, and some of the\r\nancient rocks of Anglesey.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Bonney, T. G., _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. XLII.\r\n_Proc._ p. 65.]\r\n\r\nA foliated structure may, as is now well known, be simulated by a\r\nstructure developed in a rock prior to its consolidation. The\r\nsimilarity of flow structure of some lavas to the foliated structure\r\nof a schist was long ago pointed out by Darwin and Scrope, and recent\r\nwork has proved that parallel structure due to differential movement\r\nprior to consolidation may be developed in plutonic rocks, as shown\r\nby Lieut.-General McMahon in the Himalayan granites, and by Lawson\r\namongst the plutonic rocks of the Rainy Lake Region; and as the\r\nfoliated structure may be mistaken for original stratification the\r\nsame may occur, and has occurred, when dealing with this\r\nflow-structure.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to discuss the truth of the old theory of\r\nprogressive metamorphism, in which it was maintained that a gradual\r\npassage could be traced between ordinary sediments and plutonic rocks,\r\nbut it may be pointed out that much of the evidence which was relied\r\nupon to prove the theory was fallacious and due to the confusion of\r\nthe parallel structure set up in plutonic rocks prior to, or\r\nsubsequent to, consolidation, with original stratification. Recent\r\nstudy of metamorphic rocks has proved that the parallel structures\r\ndeveloped in the rocks of an area which has undergone metamorphism may\r\nbe produced by three distinct processes; they may be original planes\r\nof deposition, or formed in a solid rock subsequently to its\r\nformation, or in an igneous rock before its consolidation, and\r\nalthough it is sometimes possible to separate the structures produced\r\nby these processes, this is not always the case[18]. When a plutonic\r\nrock contains large phenocrysts and an eye-structure is developed in\r\nit, it may simulate a conglomerate, the rounded phenocrysts being\r\ntaken for pebbles[19]. Still closer simulation of an epiclastic\r\nconglomerate may be produced in other ways and will be referred to\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: It must be noticed that the rock in which parallel\r\nstructure is produced before consolidation, if it undergoes no further\r\nchange, though often associated with metamorphic rocks, is not itself\r\nmetamorphic. The term _gneiss_ applied to these rocks is a misnomer,\r\nunless the term be used even more vaguely than it is at present.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: See Lehmann, _Untersuchungen über die Entstehung der\r\nAltkrystallinischen Schiefergesteine mit besonderer Bezugnahme auf das\r\nSächsische Granulitgebirge_, Plate XI. fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the existence of unconformities has been\r\nutilised in the demarcation of large divisions of strata in various\r\nregions, and whether they be utilised in this manner or not, their\r\ndetection is a matter of importance to the stratigraphical geologist,\r\nas they afford information concerning the occurrence of great physical\r\nchanges during their production. These unconformities may also be\r\nclosely simulated by structures produced in very different manner.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of an unconformity implies the denudation of one set of\r\nbeds before the deposition of another set upon them, and accordingly\r\nthe denuded edges of the lower set will somewhere abut against the\r\nlower surface of the lowest deposit or deposits of the overlying\r\nset[20]. The existence of an unconformity may often be detected in\r\nsection, but when the unconformity is upon a large scale this may not\r\nbe possible, but it will be discovered by mapping the strata and will\r\nbe apparent on a map owing to the deposits of the lower set of beds\r\nabutting against the others. This is well seen where the Permian rocks\r\nof Durham, Yorkshire, and Nottinghamshire rest upon different members\r\nof the underlying Carboniferous series, and will be noticed on any\r\ngood geological map of England. But a similar effect may be caused by\r\na fault, so that mere inspection of a map or even of the strata in the\r\nfield and discovery of one set of beds ending off against another does\r\nnot prove unconformity. When the fault is a normal one, with low hade\r\n(that is, having a fissure approaching the vertical position), the\r\noutcrop of the fault-fissure will approximate to a straight line if\r\nthe fault has a straight course, even if the ground be very uneven,\r\nwhereas, if the plane of unconformity has not been tilted to a high\r\nangle from its original horizontal position, it will crop out in a\r\nsinuous manner across uneven ground, in a way similar to that of beds\r\nwhich are nearly horizontal, so that though the general trend of the\r\noutcrop of the plane of unconformity may be fairly straight, its\r\ndeviation from a straight line will be frequent and marked, as seen in\r\nthe case of the Permian unconformity above referred to. But if the\r\nunconformable junction has been highly inclined its outcrop will\r\nresemble that of a normal fault, or if the fault be a thrust-plane\r\nwith high hade, the outcrop of this will resemble that of an\r\nunconformable junction which has not been greatly tilted from its\r\noriginal horizontal position. In these cases we require more evidence\r\nbefore we can decide whether we are dealing with an unconformable\r\njunction or a faulted one.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: An unconformity may be simulated or an actual\r\nunconformity rendered apparently more important, as the result of\r\nunderground solution of the underlying strata subsequently to the\r\ndeposition of the upper set upon them, and any insoluble materials in\r\nthe underlying strata may be left as an apparent pebble-bed at the\r\nbase of the upper beds. This is seen at the junction of the Tertiary\r\nbeds with the chalk near London. Subterranean water has dissolved the\r\nupper part of the chalk, increasing the unconformity which naturally\r\nexists between chalk and Tertiary beds, and the insoluble flint of the\r\ndissolved chalk is left as a layer of 'green-coated flint' at the base\r\nof the Tertiary deposits.]\r\n\r\nThe lowest deposits of the newer set of strata lying above an\r\nunconformity have probably been laid down in water near the\r\nshore-line. As the unconformity, if large, implies elevation above the\r\nsea-level, the deposits first formed after this elevation has ceased,\r\nand depression commenced, will necessarily be littoral in character\r\nand possibly of beach-formation, and accordingly we often find that an\r\nunconformity is marked by the existence of an epiclastic conglomerate\r\nimmediately above the plane of unconformity and, although this need\r\nnot be continuous, it is usually found somewhere along the line of\r\njunction. The conglomeratic base of the Lowest Carboniferous strata\r\nwhen they repose upon the upturned edges of the Lower Palæozoic rocks\r\nof the dales of West Yorkshire is well known, and may be cited as an\r\nexample. The association of conglomerates with unconformities is\r\nindeed so frequent that its possible occurrence will always be\r\nsuspected and sought by the geologist. Unfortunately the result of\r\nrecent observation is to show that along thrust-planes of which the\r\noutcrop simulates those of unconformable junctions, the difficulty of\r\ndiscrimination may be increased by the existence of cataclastic rocks\r\nwhich bear a close resemblance to epiclastic conglomerates, and which\r\nmay be and have been styled conglomerates. It is well known that\r\nfragments of the adjoining rocks are knocked into a fault-fissure\r\nduring the occurrence of the movements which cause the fault, to\r\nconstitute a _fault-breccia_, and as the result of the abrasion of\r\nthese fragments by chemical or mechanical agency, the angular\r\nfragments may become rounded and converted into rounded pebble-like\r\nbodies, when the rock is changed into a _fault-conglomerate_. Fig. 5,\r\nfrom a photograph kindly supplied by Prof. W. W. Watts, shows a stage\r\nin the formation of a conglomerate of this nature from a\r\nfault-breccia; the fragment on the right remains angular, whilst those\r\non the left have become much more rounded. The illustration is from a\r\ncase described by Mr Lamplugh occurring in the slaty rocks of the Isle\r\nof Man, and Mr Lamplugh's paper[21] furnishes the reader with\r\nreferences to other examples of the production of similar rocks. No\r\ngeneral rule can be laid down for distinguishing the true from the\r\napparent unconformity, for the attendant phenomena will differ in each\r\ncase; but if a fault-conglomerate should be suspected, the observer\r\nshould try to ascertain whether fragments of a newer rock are imbedded\r\nin an older one, which sometimes occurs; he should note the existence\r\nof extensive slickensiding along the plane of junction and along\r\nplanes of faulting, though the existence of these, implying as it does\r\nthe occurrence of differential movement along the plane, does not\r\nprove that the movement was necessarily great, or that it did not take\r\nplace along a plane of original unconformity; above all, he should\r\nlook for structures such as mylonitic structure, pseudo-stromatism,\r\ndevelopment of new minerals, crushing out and stretching of fossils\r\nand fragments and, in short, for any structure which is familiar to\r\nhim as a result of orogenic movements.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Lamplugh, G. W., \"On the Crush-Conglomerates of the Isle\r\nof Man,\" _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. LI. p. 563.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\nThe effects of thrusting not only give rise to appearances suggestive\r\nof unconformity, but naturally also to a simulation of overlap. The\r\nthrust-planes are often parallel to original bedding-planes for some\r\ndistance, but must cut across them sooner or later, producing\r\nlenticular masses which might be supposed to be due to the thinning\r\nout of beds as the result of cessation of deposition in a lateral\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nAttention has already been directed to the deceptive appearance of\r\ngreat thickness of strata which is due to repetition of one stratum or\r\nset of strata by a series of thrust-planes, so that there is no actual\r\ninversion of any part of a bed. When masses of limestone are affected\r\nin this way, the thrust-planes may become sealed up, as the result of\r\nchemical change, and a compact irregular mass of limestone devoid of\r\nany definite divisional planes may be the consequence, and beds of\r\ngrit sometimes exhibit the same feature to some extent.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show that simulation of one structure by\r\nanother has frequently occurred in rocks in so marked a degree as to\r\nrender mistakes easy; and that these examples of 'mimicry' in the\r\ninorganic world are particularly frequent in rocks which have been\r\nsubjected to great orogenic movements. The student will do well to\r\nacquaint himself with the macroscopic and microscopic structures\r\nwhich may be taken as characteristic of the rocks which have been thus\r\naffected, some of which can usually be detected with ease, and when he\r\ndiscovers them he may suspect that many phenomena which appear\r\nexplicable in one way were in reality produced in a different one, for\r\nit is frequently very true of a region in which the rocks have been\r\nviolently squeezed, stretched and broken that 'things are not what\r\nthey seem.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL MAPS AND SECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer does not propose to give an account of the intricacies of\r\ngeological mapping, for their right consideration requires a separate\r\ntreatise[22]; all he desires is to call attention to some of the uses\r\nof geological maps as a means of conveying information. A geological\r\nmap may be looked upon as an attempt to express as far as possible in\r\ntwo dimensions phenomena which possess three dimensions; this can be\r\ndone to some extent on the actual surface of the map, by conventional\r\nsigns, still more fully, by supplementing the map with sections; but\r\nbest of all by a geological model, which is cut across in various\r\ndirections in order to show the underground structure as well as that\r\nof the surface.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: The student is recommended to consult in particular,\r\nAppendix I. \"On Geological Surveying\" in _The Student's Manual of\r\nGeology_, by J. B. Jukes (Third Edition, Edited by A. Geikie), p. 747,\r\nand _Outlines of Field Geology_, by Sir A. Geikie (Macmillan and\r\nCo.).]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary geological map is one which shows the outcrop of the\r\nstrata, subdivided according to age, as they would be seen upon the\r\nsurface of the earth after stripping off the superficial\r\naccumulations, and it is to be feared that the term 'geological map'\r\nis associated in the minds of most students with a map of this\r\ncharacter and of no other. Nevertheless, a great many most important\r\nobservations other than those connected with the order of succession\r\nof the strata are capable of representation upon a geological map, and\r\nthe possession of a large number of maps of any area upon the geology\r\nof which a person is engaged--each map to be used for recording\r\nobservations of a particular kind--will save much writing in\r\nnote-books and, what is of more importance, will allow him to compare\r\nobservations which have been made at different times at a glance,\r\ninstead of causing him to search through a series of note-books.\r\nStill, however well furnished with maps, the geologist will find a\r\nnote-book essential[23].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: As a result of some experience, the writer recommends\r\nevery student to acquire some skill in the use of the pencil, and if\r\nto such a degree that he can combine artistic effect with accuracy, so\r\nmuch the better. An acquaintance with photography is invaluable: often\r\nthe possession of a camera would enable a section to be recorded,\r\nwhich is otherwise lost to science.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest geological maps represented the variations in the surface\r\nsoils, or at most the general lithological characters of the rocks\r\nwhich by their decay furnished the materials for the soils. We have\r\nseen that the first chronological map was due to William Smith, and\r\nmost subsequent English geological maps have been based upon his map\r\nof the strata of England and Wales. The order of succession of the\r\nstrata is represented in these maps to some extent by the use of\r\narrows to indicate the direction of dip of the strata, though this is\r\nnot an unerring guide where strata are reversed, and accordingly the\r\naddition of a legend at the side of the map may be looked upon as\r\nessential to the correct understanding of the map itself. The legend\r\nis usually in the form of a section of a column, the strata being\r\narranged in right order, the oldest at the base and the newest at the\r\nsummit, the colours by which the strata are indicated being similar to\r\nthose placed upon the map. Other information besides the mere order of\r\nsuccession of the strata may appear in the legend; thus their relative\r\nand actual thicknesses can be indicated if the column is drawn to some\r\ndefinite scale, and a brief description of the lithological characters\r\nof the rocks may well be appended to the side of the column. On the\r\nactual maps it is customary to exhibit the outcrop of the junctions of\r\nall igneous rocks as well as of the sedimentary ones: the nature of\r\nthe metamorphism which sedimentary rocks have undergone at the contact\r\nwith igneous ones may be and often is indicated by suitable signs; the\r\nposition of faults is shown, and often also that of metalliferous\r\nveins, the nature of the ore in the latter being further indicated in\r\nsome suitable manner, as by giving the recognised symbol for the\r\nmetal; and in many maps an attempt is made to show the variations in\r\ndip and strike of the cleavage-planes.\r\n\r\nThe Geological Survey of the United Kingdom publishes two sets of\r\nmaps, one showing the 'solid geology' and the other the 'superficial\r\ngeology.' It is easier to understand these terms than to define them,\r\nfor in Britain there is a sharp line between the two everywhere except\r\nnear Cromer. The maps showing the superficial geology represent\r\ngravels, glacial drifts and other incoherent accumulations of\r\ngeologically recent origin, which to a greater or less extent mask the\r\nstrata below which are usually composed of more or less solidified\r\nmaterial. The maps showing the solid geology display the outcrops of\r\nthese strata, though it is usual to insert alluvium upon these maps,\r\nas it is often impossible to trace the junction-lines of the strata\r\nbelow it. Attention has already been directed to the fact that these\r\nmaps of solid geology, though chronological, that is, having the\r\nstrata represented according to age, are founded largely upon\r\nlithological differences, rather than upon included organisms; and it\r\nhas been stated that for theoretical purposes two sets of\r\nchronological maps, one founded upon lithological differences, the\r\nother upon difference of fossil organisms, would be extremely\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nOther phenomena are often best represented upon separate maps, for if\r\nall observations are crowded upon one map the result will be very\r\nconfusing. Special glacial maps showing the contour of the country,\r\nwith the portions between the contour lines coloured differently\r\naccording to altitude, say the country between sea-level and 500 feet\r\nlight green, that between 500 and 1000 dark green, that between 1000\r\nand 1500 light brown and so on, exhibiting the direction of all\r\nobserved glacial striae, the distribution of boulders so far as it is\r\npossible, and any other glacial phenomena which can be noted upon the\r\nmap, will be valuable to the student of glaciation[24].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: For examples see Tiddeman, R. H., \"Evidence for the\r\nIce-Sheet in North Lancashire and the adjacent parts of Yorkshire and\r\nWestmorland,\" _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. XXVIII. pl. XXX., and\r\nGoodchild, J. G., \"Glacial Phenomena of the Eden Valley\" &c., _Quart.\r\nJourn. Geol. Soc._, vol. XXXI. pl. II.; and for a map of distribution\r\nof boulders, Ward, J. C., \"Geology of the Northern Part of the English\r\nLake District\" (_Mem. Geol. Survey_), pl. IV.]\r\n\r\nVarious structural features may be well displayed on separate maps.\r\nThe trend of the axes of folds will be useful, and may be accompanied\r\nby other information of cognate character[25]; maps of the\r\ndistribution of joint planes may be given in combination with those\r\nshowing the folding of the strata if it be desired to exhibit the\r\nrelationship between these; or with the physical features of the\r\ncountry, if the dependence of physical features upon joint structure\r\nbe under consideration[26]. Much information concerning cleavage may\r\nbe acquired from a map showing anticlinal and synclinal axes of\r\ncleavage[27], or the actual strike of the cleavage over different\r\nparts of a map may be represented, and its relationship to the\r\ngeological structure of the district exhibited[28].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: See Bertrand, M., \"Sur le Raccordement des Bassins\r\nHouillers du nord de la France et du sud de l'Angleterre,\" _Annales\r\ndes Mines_, Jan. 1893, Plate 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: See Daubrée, A., _Études Synthétiques de Géologie\r\nExpérimentale_, 1^{ère} Partie, Plates III.-VI., for an example of the\r\nlatter, which is also interesting as showing the utility of a map on\r\ntransparent paper super-posed on another, when illustrating the\r\nconnexion between two sets of structures.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Ward, J. C., _Geology of the Northern Part of the\r\nEnglish Lake District_, Plate IX.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Harker, Alfred, \"The Bala Volcanic Series of\r\nCaernarvonshire\" (_Sedgwick Essay_ for 1888), Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\nMaps exhibiting changes in physical geography appertain to the\r\ngeologist as well as to the geographer. The position of ancient\r\nbeaches, former lakes, representation of the changes in the courses of\r\nrivers and kindred phenomena may be shown upon maps, and will prove\r\nuseful[29].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: For examples of maps of this kind, see Kjerulf, Th.,\r\n_Die Geologie des südlichen und mittleren Norwegen_.]\r\n\r\nA perusal of the maps to which reference has been made above will give\r\nthe student some notion of the extent to which maps may be utilised to\r\nrepresent geological structures, and may suggest other methods by\r\nwhich they may be utilised.\r\n\r\nA geological section is usually drawn in order to exhibit the lie of\r\nthe rocks, as it would be seen if a vertical cutting were made in that\r\npart of the earth's crust which is under consideration. The character\r\nof the section will depend upon circumstances. The Geological Survey\r\nof Great Britain issues two kinds of sections which are usually spoken\r\nof as vertical sections and horizontal sections, though each is in\r\ntruth a vertical section; but whereas in the former the horizontal\r\ndistance represented is small as compared with the thickness of the\r\nstrata, in the latter the rocks of a considerable horizontal extent of\r\ncountry are exhibited in the section, and the section is not carried\r\ndown to a great depth below the earth's surface. There is no essential\r\ndifference between the two kinds of section, and often sections are\r\ndrawn which cannot be definitely classed as belonging to either kind,\r\nbut in extreme cases the vertical section is a representation of the\r\norder of succession as it would appear if the rocks were horizontal,\r\nno matter how disturbed they may be in reality; whereas the horizontal\r\nsection represents the strata as they actually occur, with all the\r\nfolds and faults by which they are affected. The accompanying figure\r\n(Fig. 6) represents a horizontal section on the left side of the\r\nfigure with a vertical section of the same rocks on the right side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\nVertical sections are extremely useful when it is desirable to compare\r\nvariations in the strata over wide extents of country: this can be\r\ndone by drawing a series of columns of the strata, each showing in\r\nvertical section the lithological characters and thicknesses of the\r\nstrata in one place, whilst the relationship between the strata of\r\ntwo different places may be indicated by joining the beds of the same\r\nage by dotted lines as shown in Fig. 7[30].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: It is useful to adopt conventional symbols for the\r\nrepresentation of strata of different lithological characters, and so\r\nfar as possible to adhere to the same kind of symbol for any one kind\r\nof deposit. Those which are generally in use, are rough pictorial\r\nrepresentations of the characters of the deposits, as shown in Fig. 7.\r\nThe conglomerate is indicated by circular marks representing\r\ncross-sections of the pebbles, a breccia by triangular marks\r\nsignifying that the fragments are angular and not rounded; a sandstone\r\nis indicated by dots to represent the grains of sand; a mud, clay or\r\nshale by continuous or broken horizontal lines, which reproduce the\r\nappearance of the planes of lamination so frequent in beds of this\r\ncomposition; a limestone is usually marked by the use of regular\r\nhorizontal lines illustrating the pronounced bedding, with vertical\r\nlines at intervals to represent the regular jointing which occurs in\r\nso many limestones: the nature of the bedding may be further shown by\r\ndrawing the lines comparatively far apart when the limestone is a\r\nthick-bedded one, nearer together when it is thin-bedded. Igneous\r\nrocks are represented by crosses or irregular V-shaped marks,\r\nillustrating the absence of stratification and presence of joints.\r\n\r\nVolcanic ashes are sometimes represented by dots, at other times by\r\nsigns somewhat similar to those which are used for true igneous rocks.\r\nSedimentary rocks which are composed of more than one kind of material\r\nmay be further shown by a combination of two symbols, thus the\r\nexistence of a sandy clay may be shown by means of a combination of\r\nhorizontal lines and dots, and so with other combinations. The\r\npractical geologist should become accustomed to the use of these\r\nsymbols in his note-book; if used, they will save much writing.\r\n\r\nThese symbols are used in some of the later illustrations to this\r\nbook.]\r\n\r\nThe horizontal section is one which is in constant use by the\r\npractical geologist: the results of the first traverse of a district\r\nmay be jotted down in his note-book in the form of a horizontal\r\nsection (with accompanying notes), and the written memoir on the\r\ngeology of any district composed largely of stratified rocks will\r\nalmost certainly require illustration by means of these sections.\r\nPerhaps nothing more clearly marks the careful observer than the\r\nnature of the sections which he makes, and geological literature is\r\ntoo frequently marred by the publication of slovenly sections. A badly\r\ndrawn section not only offends the eye, it may and frequently does\r\nconvey inaccurate information.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\nIn the above figure (Fig. 8) taken from Sir Henry de la Beche's\r\n\"Sections and Views Illustrative of Geological Phænomena,\" Plate II.,\r\nthe lower drawing represents a section drawn to true scale, while that\r\nabove shows one which is exaggerated. The student who saw this would\r\ninfer that the uppermost beds on the left side of the upper section\r\nrested unconformably upon the dotted beds beneath, and once abutted\r\nagainst them in that portion of the figure where the beds have been\r\nremoved by denudation in the deep valley, whereas an examination of\r\nthe section drawn to true scale shows that the unconformity does not\r\nexist (although there is one at the base of the deposits marked by\r\ndots), and that there is room for the higher deposits to pass above\r\nthose marked by dots at the place where the former have been removed\r\nby denudation. Whenever possible, horizontal sections should be drawn\r\nto true scale, the vertical heights being on the same scale as the\r\nhorizontal distances. Sections which are so drawn represent the nature\r\nof the surface of the country as well as the relationship of the\r\nstrata, and often illustrate in a marked degree the influence which\r\nthe character of the strata has exerted upon the nature of the\r\nsuperficial features of a country. If it be impossible to draw a\r\nsection in which the elevations and horizontal distances are\r\nrepresented upon a true scale, the former ought to be drawn on a scale\r\nwhich is a multiple of the latter; thus the vertical heights may be\r\nshown on 2, 3, or 4 or more times the scale chosen for the horizontal\r\ndistances; when this is done, it will often be necessary to show the\r\nstrata with an exaggerated dip, and accordingly the exaggerated\r\nsection loses some of its value, though if vertical and horizontal\r\nscales bear some definite proportion it will still be more valuable\r\nthan a rough diagram which is not drawn to any scale.\r\n\r\nSection-drawing cannot be satisfactorily accomplished without some\r\npractice, and the student is strongly advised to acquire the art of\r\ndrawing good sections; the writer can assert as the result of\r\nconsiderable experience in the conduct of examinations of all kinds,\r\nthat slovenly sections are the rule in candidates' papers, and good\r\nsections very rarely appear. Study of the six-inch maps and horizontal\r\nsections (drawn on the same scale) of the Geological Survey of the\r\nUnited Kingdom will enable the student to familiarise himself with\r\nadmirable sections, and it should be his aim to produce sections like\r\nthese. He is recommended to take some of these six-inch maps which\r\nshow contour-lines as well as the disposition of the strata, and to\r\ndraw sections on the scale of six inches to the mile, vertical and\r\nhorizontal, exhibiting the proper outline of the ground and the\r\narrangement of the strata, and afterwards to compare them with the\r\npublished sections. The sections should be drawn as far as possible at\r\nright angles to the general strike of the strata. Some datum-line is\r\ntaken for the base of the section (say sea-level) and offsets drawn\r\nvertically from this where the section crosses a contour-line or\r\nrecorded height. The height is marked on these offsets; thus if a\r\nrecorded height of 2700 feet (just over half a mile) occurred on the\r\nline of section a height of somewhat over three inches is marked on\r\nthe offset, and so with the other points where the section crosses\r\ncontours or recorded heights. By joining these points on the offsets,\r\ngiving the connecting lines curves similar to those which are likely\r\nto occur in nature, the general character of the surface of the ground\r\nis represented. The geology of the district is next shown. Wherever a\r\ndip is marked on the map, the direction and amount of dip is shown by\r\na short line on the section, and where dips are not actually seen\r\nalong the line of section, the dips which are nearest to that line on\r\nthe map must be considered, and marked on the section. The lines of\r\njunction between the various deposits shown by different colours upon\r\nthe map are inserted on the section as short lines, the inclination\r\nbeing judged by study of the nearest dips; faults and igneous rocks\r\nmust be marked off, and any indication of the hade of the fault or the\r\nslope of the edges of the igneous rock which the map affords will be\r\ntaken into account. The section will then appear somewhat as shown in\r\nthe following figure:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\nand sufficient indication of the trend of the rocks will be obtained\r\nto shew that they form portions of curves which may then be filled in\r\nas shown in Fig. 10 and the section will be complete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the small dyke of igneous rock on the right of\r\nthe main dyke is joined to it lower down, though no indication of this\r\nis given along the line of section; but the requisite information for\r\nthis and evidence of the existence of the small dyke proceeding from\r\nthe left-hand side of the main one may be obtained by the study of\r\nthe rocks in a valley on one side or other of the line of section.\r\n\r\nAfter the student has become conversant with the nature of geological\r\nmaps and sections, and has read Sir A. Geikie's _Outlines of Field\r\nGeology_, he should on no account omit to learn something of the art\r\nof making geological maps, by going into the field and attempting to\r\nproduce a map, for the art of geological surveying does not come\r\nnaturally to any one, and some acquaintance with the methods of\r\nsurveying is a necessity to everyone who wishes to make original\r\ngeological observations, though all cannot expect to afford the time\r\nand acquire the skill necessary for the production of maps vying with\r\nthe detailed maps of the Government Survey. Before actually attempting\r\nto draw lines on a map on his own account, he will do well to tramp\r\nover a portion of a district with the published geological map in his\r\nhands, selecting a country which is not characterised by great\r\nintricacy of geological structure, and he can then attempt to\r\nrepresent the geology of another portion of the same district without\r\nconsulting the published map. Of all the districts of Britain with\r\nwhich he is acquainted the writer believes that the basin of the river\r\nRibble, in the neighbourhood of the town of Settle in the West Riding\r\nof Yorkshire, is best adapted for studying field geology in the way\r\nsuggested above, for the main geological features are marked by\r\nextreme simplicity, and the exposures are good, whilst the presence of\r\nan important fault-system and of a great unconformity relieve the area\r\nfrom monotony. Anyone who stands on the summit of Ingleborough or\r\nPenyghent will grasp the main features of a portion of the district\r\nwithout any difficulty, for it lies beneath his feet like a geological\r\nmodel, and when the student has mastered and mapped in the leading\r\nfeatures, he can find bits of country with geology of varying degrees\r\nof complexity amongst the Lower Palæozoic rocks of the valleys which\r\nrun down to Ingleton, Clapham, Austwick and Settle.\r\n\r\nThe biologist is supplied with laboratories at home and abroad, where\r\nhe may study his science under the best conditions. Would that some\r\nmunificent person would found, in a district like that referred to\r\nabove, a geological station where Cambridge students would have the\r\nmeans of acquiring a knowledge of field-geology under conditions more\r\nfavourable than those presented by the flats around the sluggish Cam!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nEVIDENCES OF CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH STRATA WERE FORMED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the order of succession of the strata, and the\r\ncorrelation of strata of different areas merely pave the way for the\r\ngeologist. To write the history of the earth during various geological\r\nages, he has to ascertain the physical and climatic conditions which\r\nprevailed during the successive geological periods, and to study the\r\nvarious problems connected with the life of each period. In the\r\npresent chapter an attempt will be made to illustrate the methods\r\nwhich have been pursued in order to write to the fullest degree which\r\nis compatible with our present knowledge, the earth-history of various\r\nages of the past. In making this attempt, the physical and climatic\r\nconditions may be first considered, and their consideration followed\r\nby that of the changes in the faunas, though it will frequently be\r\nnecessary to refer to one set of conditions as illustrative of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIt will be assumed here that the great principle of geology, that the\r\nmodern changes of the earth and its inhabitants are illustrative of\r\npast changes, is rigidly true. Reference will be made to this\r\nprinciple in a later chapter, but it is sufficient to state here that\r\nthe study of the sediments which have been deposited from the\r\ncommencement of Lower Palæozoic times to the times in which we now\r\nlive bear the marks of having been formed under physical conditions,\r\nwhich, in the main, are similar in kind to those which prevail upon\r\nsome part of the surface of the lithosphere at the present day.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important inferences of the stratigrapher relates to\r\nthe existence of marine or terrestrial conditions over an area at any\r\nparticular time, and we may, in the first place, consider the evidence\r\nwhich supplies us with a clue to this subject.\r\n\r\nIt has been previously stated that the ocean is essentially the\r\ntheatre of deposition, the land that of destruction, and accordingly,\r\nthe presence of deposit as a general rule indicates the evidence of\r\nmarine conditions during the formation of those deposits, though this\r\nis not universally the case. Again, as denudation is practically\r\nconfined to the land areas, and the shallow-waters at their margins,\r\nunconformity on a large scale gives evidence of the existence of\r\nterrestrial conditions in the area in which it is developed, during\r\nits production. Accordingly a mass of deposit separated from deposits\r\nabove and below by marked unconformities shows the alternation of\r\nterrestrial conditions (during which the unconformity was produced)\r\nand marine conditions (during which the deposits were laid down). The\r\ndeposits formed after an unconformity has been developed will\r\nnaturally be of shallow-water character, as will also be those of the\r\nperiod immediately preceding the incoming of conditions which will\r\ncause the occurrence of another unconformity, and between these two\r\nshallow-water periods will occur a period when deeper-water conditions\r\nprobably prevailed. We can therefore not only divide the history of\r\nany particular area into a series of chapters, of which every two\r\nsuccessive ones will describe a continental period and a marine one,\r\nbut each marine period may be divided into three phases--a\r\nshallow-water phase at the commencement, an intermediate deeper-water\r\nphase, and a shallow-water phase at the end. These phases are\r\nfrequently complicated by the occurrence of a host of minor changes,\r\nbut on eliminating these, the effects of the three great phases are\r\nshown by study of the nature of the strata, and their recognition does\r\nmuch to simplify the detailed study of the stratigraphical geology of\r\nvarious parts of the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nIn discriminating between terrestrial conditions and marine ones, the\r\nexistence of unconformities is of great importance in marking\r\nterrestrial conditions and is often the only available evidence, for\r\nno accumulations or deposits formed on the land may be preserved to\r\ntestify to the terrestrial conditions[31]. When terrestrial deposits\r\nand accumulations do occur, they are extremely important, and it is\r\nnecessary to allude to the points wherein they differ from marine\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: The term terrestrial is used above in opposition to\r\nmarine, to include the conditions prevalent above sea-level. The term\r\ncontinental would be better if it did not exclude insular conditions.\r\nAccordingly deposits formed in rivers, and fresh-water and salt-water\r\nlakes are spoken of as terrestrial.]\r\n\r\nApart from organic contents, the mechanically formed deposits of\r\nrivers and lakes resemble in general characters the shallow-water\r\ndeposits of the ocean, though they are usually less widely\r\ndistributed. It is the accumulations which have actually been formed\r\nas æolian rocks, or those which have been laid down as chemical\r\nprecipitates in salt-lakes which, by study of lithological characters,\r\nfurnish the most convincing evidence of their terrestrial origin.\r\n\r\nMany æolian accumulations may be looked upon as soils, if the term\r\nsoil be used in a special sense to refer to the accumulations which\r\nare produced as the result of the excess of disintegration over\r\ntransportation in an area, whilst others are due to transport which\r\nhas not been sufficiently effective to carry the material to the sea.\r\nWhen the weathered material accumulates above the weathered rock, it\r\ndepends chiefly upon climate whether the disintegrated rock becomes\r\nmingled with much decayed organic matter forming humus. If this\r\norganic matter exists in quantity, the probability is that the\r\naccumulation is a terrestrial one, though this is by no means\r\nnecessarily the case, for under exceptional circumstances a good deal\r\nof humus may be deposited in the sea, as beneath the mangrove-swamps\r\nwhich line the coasts of some regions, and to go further back, in the\r\ncase of the Cromer Forest series of Pliocene times, or some coals,\r\nsuch as the Wigan Cannel Coal of the Carboniferous strata.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the work of water, which affects both land and\r\nsea-deposits, the land is especially characterised by the operations\r\nof wind and frost upon it, for these produce results which may\r\nfrequently serve to differentiate a land-accumulation from a deposit\r\nlaid down beneath sea-level. The effect of wind in rounding the grains\r\nof sand which are blown by it is well-known, and samples of the\r\n'millet-seed' sands of desert regions are preserved in most museums.\r\nThe greater rounding which characterises wind-borne as compared with\r\nwater-borne sand grains is due, in great measure, to the greater\r\nfriction between the grains when carried by the air than when swept\r\nalong by the water. Under favourable circumstances water-worn grains\r\nmay become rounded, especially when agitated by gentle currents\r\nsweeping over a shoal[32]; but a large mass of sand, in which most of\r\nthe grains have undergone much rounding so as to give rise to\r\n'millet-seed' sand, will nevertheless be probably formed by\r\nwind-action except where a marine deposit is formed of material\r\nlargely derived from an earlier æolian one. The effect of frost is to\r\nsplit rocks into fragments which are more or less angular before they\r\nare subjected to water-action. The broken fragments are prone to\r\ncollect on slopes as screes, and as any scree-material falling into\r\nthe sea is likely to become rounded except under conditions which\r\nrarely prevail, the existence of much scree-material in a rock\r\nsuggests its terrestrial origin. Glaciers gave rise to terrestrial\r\nmoraines, which may occasionally be identified as land-accumulations\r\nby mere inspection of their physical characters, but all geologists\r\nare aware of the difficulties with which they are confronted when they\r\nattempt to discriminate between terrestrial and marine glacial\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Cf. Hunt, A. R., \"The Evidence of the Skerries Shoal on\r\nthe wearing of Fine Sands by Waves,\" _Trans. Devon. Assoc._, 1887,\r\nvol. XIX. p. 498.]\r\n\r\nThe existence of much material amongst the stratified rocks which has\r\nbeen precipitated from a state of solution is an indication of the\r\nterrestrial origin of the rocks, which were laid down on the floors of\r\nthe inland seas, separated more or less completely from the open\r\nocean; for the waters of the ocean are capable of retaining in\r\nsolution all of the material which is brought down to them, and\r\naccordingly precipitates of carbonate of lime, rock-salt, gypsum and\r\nother compounds formed from solution, are only formed on a large scale\r\nin inland lakes, though they may be formed to some extent when the\r\nwater of a lagoon is only slightly connected with that of the open\r\nocean, and the evaporation is great, for instance in the lagoons of\r\ncoral reefs. Certain physical features often mark the deposits of\r\nchemical origin, cubical or hopper-crystals of rock-salt may be\r\ndissolved, and the hollow afterwards filled with mud, so that the rock\r\nsurfaces are sometimes marked with pseudomorphs of mud after\r\nrock-salt. Sun-cracks and rain-prints impressed on the rock are not\r\nactual indications of terrestrial origin of the rocks on which they\r\nare found, for the shallow-water muds of an estuary may be deposited\r\nin the sea and yet exposed to the action of the air at low tide, but\r\nthey mark very shallow-water deposits which have been exposed to the\r\natmosphere immediately after their formation if not during the time\r\nthey were formed, and they frequently occur amongst the deposits of\r\ninland lakes.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the characters of the terrestrial\r\naccumulations serve to distinguish them to some extent from the marine\r\nones, but they also enable one to detect to some degree the actual\r\nconditions under which the accumulation was produced, whether on the\r\nmountain-slope, or in the plain, the desert or the fen, the river-bank\r\nor the lake-floor.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of formation of the marine deposits may be\r\ndistinguished within certain limits with ease, by examination of their\r\nphysical characters, for the near-shore deposits will generally be\r\ncoarser and contain more mechanically-transported material than the\r\nsediments which accumulate at a greater distance from the shore,\r\nthough it is not safe to infer that deposits are formed away from the\r\nshore on account of the absence of mechanically-transported sediments.\r\nIn districts where the mechanically-transported material is rapidly\r\ndeposited, organic deposits of great purity may form close to the\r\ncoast-line; for instance, when the rivers of a country end in fjords,\r\nthe mechanical sediments are deposited in the fjords, and the sea\r\naround the coast is free from this sediment, and there the organisms\r\ncan build up deposits of great purity; and a similar thing may happen\r\nwhen the rivers on one side of a country have short courses, and do\r\nnot carry down much sediment, which occurs when the watershed is near\r\nthe coast. On the one hand, clay may be formed in considerable purity\r\nnear the coast, where the supply of mud is so great that the organisms\r\nexisting there can do little in the way of contribution to the mass of\r\nthe deposit, or it may be formed on the other hand in great depths of\r\nthe ocean, where the supply of sediment is extremely small, but where\r\nall the organic tests become dissolved; as the characters of the deep\r\nsea clays are mainly negative, a geologist examining the rocks of the\r\ngeological column would have much difficulty in distinguishing a\r\ndeep-water clay from a shallow-water one by its lithological\r\ncharacters only. In cases of difficulty, information of importance is\r\nlikely to be furnished by examination of the relative thickness of\r\nequivalent deposits in adjoining areas, for if we find a mass of clay\r\na few feet thick in one region represented by hundreds of feet of clay\r\nand limestone in another, the former mass probably accumulated slowly\r\nand at some distance from the land; again, the uniformity of\r\nlithological characters of a deposit over a very wide area is a\r\npossible indication of its formation away from land, but this is not a\r\nsafe guide, for reasons which will eventually appear, unless it can be\r\nshown that the deposit is everywhere of the same age.\r\n\r\nA clue to climatic conditions is frequently furnished by the physical\r\ncharacters of accumulations, especially terrestrial ones. The\r\naccumulations containing a large percentage of hydrocarbons have\r\nprobably been formed under fairly temperate and moist climatic\r\nconditions, whilst the existence of millet-seed sandstones associated\r\nwith chemical deposits points to desert conditions and inland lakes,\r\nrequiring a dry climate and probably a warm one. Glaciated surfaces\r\nand glacial deposits of course indicate a low temperature. Some\r\ngeologists profess that occasionally they can even determine the\r\ndirection of the prevailing winds during past periods, by examination\r\nof the character of ripple-marks, rain-pits and other features, though\r\nit is doubtful whether much reliance can be placed upon these obscure\r\nindications.\r\n\r\nUseful as is the physical evidence supplied by deposits, as an index\r\nto the conditions under which they were formed, it is usually only\r\nsupplementary to the evidence derived from a study of the fossils.\r\nFossils when present in the rocks, usually supply considerable\r\ninformation concerning the prevalent conditions during the deposition\r\nof the rocks. By them we can not only separate marine from terrestrial\r\ndeposits, but also freshwater deposits from æolian accumulations; each\r\nkind of deposit will generally contain the remains of organisms which\r\nexisted under the conditions prevalent in the area of formation of the\r\nrock, though it is of course a frequent thing for a terrestrial\r\ncreature or plant to be washed into a freshwater area or into the sea.\r\nIn an æolian deposit, the invertebrate remains may be those of any\r\nair-breathing forms, as insects, galley-worms, spiders, scorpions and\r\nmolluscs. The land-molluscs are all univalve. Of vertebrates, we may\r\nfind the bones and teeth of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.\r\nOccasionally freshwater or even marine forms may be found in an æolian\r\ndeposit, but they will be exceptional. Marine shells are often blown\r\namongst the sand-grains of the coastal dunes, and seagulls and other\r\nbirds frequently carry marine organisms far inland.\r\n\r\nThe creatures frequenting fresh water differ from those of the land\r\nand of the sea. The most abundant vertebrate remains will be those of\r\nfishes, and of the invertebrates we find mollusca preponderate. The\r\nvariety of molluscs is not so great as in the case of marine faunas.\r\nThe bivalves always possess two muscular scars on each valve (except\r\nadult _Mulleria_); whilst many marine shells as the oyster have only\r\none muscular scar on each valve. (See Fig. 11.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.\r\n\r\n_A._ Monomyary shell with one scar.\r\n\r\n_B._ Dimyary shell with two scars.]\r\n\r\nThese scars mark the attachment of the adductor muscles, for drawing\r\nthe valves together, and the shells with only one impression on each\r\nvalve are called _monomyary_, those with two impressions _dimyary_.\r\nThe discovery of monomyary shells indicates with tolerable certainty\r\nthe marine character of the deposit in which they are found, though\r\ntheir absence cannot be taken as proof of freshwater origin. The\r\nbeaks or umbones of the bivalves are often corroded in freshwater\r\ndeposits, as may be seen by examining shells of the common freshwater\r\nmussel. \"All univalve shells of land and freshwater species, with the\r\nexception of _Melanopsis_ and _Achatina_, which has a slight\r\nindentation, have entire mouths; and this circumstance may often serve\r\nas a convenient rule for distinguishing freshwater from marine strata;\r\nsince if any univalves occur of which the mouths are not entire, we\r\nmay presume that the formation is marine[33].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Lyell's _Students' Elements of Geology_, Second Edition\r\n(1874), Chap. III. A good account of the differences between\r\nfreshwater and marine organisms, from which some of the facts here\r\ncited are extracted, will be there found.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.\r\n\r\n_A._ Holostomatous shell.\r\n\r\n_B._ Siphonostomatous shell.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 12 _A_ shows a freshwater shell (_Vivipara_) with entire\r\nmouth, whilst _B_ exhibits the shell of a marine gastropod\r\n(_Pleurotoma_) with a notched mouth. The entire-mouthed shells are\r\ncalled _holostomatous_ whilst those which are notched, the notch being\r\noften prolonged into a canal, are termed _siphonostomatous_.\r\n\r\nMany groups of invertebrates are seldom or never found in fresh water.\r\nOf exclusively or nearly exclusively marine creatures we may name the\r\nforaminifera, radiolaria, sponges with a hard framework, most hydrozoa\r\nwhich secrete hard parts, corals, echinoderms, cirripedes, king-crabs,\r\nlocust-shrimps, most polyzoa, brachiopods, pteropods, heteropods, and\r\ncephalopods. Of extinct groups, the graptolites and trilobites seem to\r\nhave been entirely confined to the sea.\r\n\r\nIn the modern and comparatively modern deposits, the forms frequently\r\nbelong to existing genera, and we get fairly conclusive evidence of\r\nthe conditions of deposit by determination of the genera. The\r\nterrestrial (including freshwater) molluscs have mostly a long range\r\nin time. We find pulmoniferous gastropods of living genera in the\r\nCarboniferous period, one (_Dendropupa_) belongs to a subgenus of the\r\nmodern land-shell _Pupa_, the other (_Zonites_) to a subgenus of the\r\nsnail group _Helix_. Many freshwater molluscs as _Unio_, _Cyclas_, and\r\n_Physa_ are found amongst the secondary rocks, and give a clue to the\r\norigin of the deposits which contain them. Many extinct genera are\r\nclosely allied to modern genera, and their mode of existence may be\r\nassumed with fair certainty. With all these guides, we may sometimes\r\nbe left in doubt as to the conditions of deposit when organisms are\r\nfew in number; thus, it is yet a matter for discussion whether the Old\r\nRed Sandstone and many of the deposits of the Coal Measures of Britain\r\nwere of freshwater or marine origin.\r\n\r\nIn considering the possibility of fossils having been carried from\r\nland to water or _vice versa_, it will be remembered that generally\r\nspeaking they are more readily transferred from a higher to a lower\r\nlevel, so we are more likely to find remains of land-animals and\r\nplants in fresh water or the sea, and relics of freshwater animals and\r\nplants in the sea, than of marine or freshwater animals and plants in\r\nland, or marine organisms in fresh water. River-gravels and lacustrine\r\ndeposits are especially prone to contain a considerable intermixture\r\nof land-forms with those proper to the station.\r\n\r\nFossils supply much information concerning the depth and distance from\r\nland at which the deposits were laid down. When portions of the\r\nocean-water have been separated to form inland lakes, the water\r\nbecomes saltier than that of the open ocean, if the evaporation is\r\ngreater than the supply of fresh water, and the life of the inland sea\r\nundergoes change under the unfavourable conditions set up. Many forms\r\ndisappear altogether, and those which survive tend to become stunted,\r\nand the shells of many of the mollusca are abnormally thin; the fauna\r\nof an inland sea though it may have abundance of individuals is apt to\r\nbe characterised by paucity of species.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the faunas of the open oceans, it is found that in\r\naddition to latitude, the distribution of organisms is affected by\r\ndepth, and by the nature of the sea-floor, and accordingly we find\r\ndifferent organisms in different areas; and in examining the same area\r\nthe organisms inhabiting different depths are not all the same, and at\r\nthe same depth some kinds of animals have different _stations_ from\r\nthose of others, one creature being confined to a sandy floor, another\r\nto a muddy one, and so on[34]. The oceans have been divided into 18\r\n_provinces_, each of which is more or less characterised by the\r\npossession of peculiar forms which are termed _endemic_, in contrast\r\nto the _sporadic_ forms which are widely distributed. In any area\r\nwhich is margined by a coast line, the molluscs are distributed in\r\nzones which were formerly classed as follows:--the _littoral_ zone\r\nbetween tide marks, the _laminarian_ zone from low water to fifteen\r\nfathoms, the _coralline_ zone between fifteen and fifty fathoms, and\r\nthe _deep-sea coral_ zone from fifty fathoms to one hundred fathoms or\r\nmore; this last depth was once supposed to mark the limit of the\r\ndownward extension of marine life, but as the result of modern\r\ndeep-sea soundings we know that organisms extend to a much greater\r\ndepth, and the deep-sea fauna, owing to uniformity of conditions over\r\nwide areas, contains fewer endemic forms in proportion to the sporadic\r\nones than the shallow-water[35]. The deep-sea deposits entomb the\r\nremains of these deep-sea organisms and also of numerous _pelagic_\r\norganisms which live upon the surface of the ocean, whose remains sink\r\nto the ocean-floor after death. Amongst the deposits of the deeper\r\nparts of the ocean, we find many which are almost exclusively composed\r\nof the tests of foraminifera, radiolaria and pteropods, the spicules\r\nof sponges, and the frustules of diatoms; and accordingly the\r\nexistence of foraminiferal, pteropodan, radiolarian, and diatomaceous\r\noozes, amongst the strata of the geological column, has been taken by\r\nsome as indicating the prevalence of deep-sea conditions during the\r\nformation of those deposits: as the purity of a calcareous ooze\r\ndepends upon the absence of mechanical sediment, or volcanic dust, and\r\nas the component organisms of these oozes are pelagic forms which live\r\nnear the continents as well as in the open oceans, the presence of\r\ncalcareous oozes implies the existence of a _clear_ sea during their\r\ndeposition but not necessarily of a deep one, for if the sea-area be\r\nfar away from land masses, or if the sediment be strained off in\r\nfjords, calcareous oozes may be formed in shallow water. The existence\r\nof pure radiolarian or diatomaceous deposits is better evidence of\r\ndeep water, for if they were formed in shallow water we should expect\r\nan intermixture of calcareous tests, whereas these are dissolved\r\nwhilst sinking into the extreme depths of the ocean. As the deep-sea\r\ncreatures are under very different conditions from those of shallower\r\nwaters, we might expect marked structural differences between the deep\r\nand shallow-water creatures: one such difference has been emphasized,\r\nnamely the occurrence of animals which are blind or have enormously\r\ndeveloped eyes in the great depths of the sea, where the only light is\r\ndue to phosphorescent organisms. This is well seen in the case of many\r\nrecent crustacea, and has been noted by Suess in the case of the\r\ntrilobites of some beds which he accordingly infers to be of\r\ndeep-water origin, and it is interesting to find that these creatures\r\nare found in deposits which give independent evidence of an open-water\r\norigin. The _Æglinæ_ of the Ordovician strata are frequently furnished\r\nwith enormous eyes, and they are often accompanied by blind\r\ntrilobites, and in Bohemia the blind and large-eyed forms are\r\nsometimes different species of the same genus, for instance\r\n_Illænus_[36].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: For an account of the distribution of one group of\r\norganisms see Woodward, S. P., _A Manual of the Mollusca_, from which\r\nmany of the following observations are taken.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: For an account of the deep-sea fauna, see Hickson, S.\r\nJ., _The Fauna of the Deep Sea_, 1894.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Suess, E., _Das Antlitz der Erde_, 2^{er}. Bd., p. 266.]\r\n\r\nAs one would naturally expect, the actual depth at which deposits were\r\nformed can generally be calculated with a greater degree of certainty\r\namongst the newer rocks than amongst the older ones. In the case of\r\nthe Pliocene Crags, the depth in fathoms may be confidently given. In\r\nthe Cretaceous rocks attempts have been made to give numerical\r\nestimates of the depths at which different accumulations were formed,\r\nbut some differences of opinion have arisen in the case of these\r\nrocks. In the Palæozoic rocks, only a rough idea of the general depth\r\ncan usually be obtained, and no attempt to calculate the depth in\r\nfathoms is likely to be even approximately correct in the present\r\nstate of our knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe comminution of fossils has sometimes been taken as an indication\r\nof shallower water origin of the deposits which contain them, but\r\nalthough the hard parts of organisms in a broken condition have\r\nfrequently been shattered by the action of the waves, they may also be\r\nbroken at great depths by predaceous creatures, and in many instances\r\nthe fracture is the result of earth-movements occurring subsequently\r\nto the formation of the deposits.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the difference in organisms which results from\r\ndifference of station, it will be sufficient to give a quotation from\r\nWoodward's _Manual of the Mollusca_ as an illustration:--\"In Europe\r\nthe characteristic genera of _rocky_ shores are _Littorina_,\r\n_Patella_, and _Purpura_; of sandy beaches, _Cardium_, _Tellina_,\r\n_Solen_; gravelly shores, _Mytilus_; and on muddy shores, _Lutraria_\r\nand _Pullastra_. On rocky coasts are also found many species of\r\n_Haliotis_, _Siphonaria_, _Fissurella_, and _Trochus_; they occur at\r\nvarious levels, some only at the high-water line, others in a middle\r\nzone, or at the verge of low-water. _Cypræa_ and _Conus_ shelter under\r\ncoral-blocks, and _Cerithium_, _Terebra_, _Natica_ and _Pyramidella_\r\nbury in sand at low-water, but may be found by tracing the marks of\r\ntheir long burrows (Macgillivray)[37].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Woodward, S. P., _A Manual of the Mollusca_, p. 151.]\r\n\r\nThe geologist will naturally select sporadic forms rather than endemic\r\nones in comparing the strata of different areas, but how far\r\ndifferences in faunas are the result of existence at different times,\r\nand how far they are due to difference of conditions affecting\r\ncontemporaneous organisms can only be discovered as the result of\r\naccurate observation. The main points to be regarded when comparing\r\nthe successive faunas of different regions have been noticed in this\r\nand the preceding chapters, and it has been shown that as the evidence\r\nis cumulative, it requires the collection of a large number of facts\r\nobtained by observation of the strata before accurate inferences can\r\nbe drawn.\r\n\r\nThe indications of climatic conditions furnished by organisms require\r\nsome consideration. In the comparatively recent deposits it is not\r\ndifficult to get some notion of the prevalent climatic conditions when\r\nthe fossils belong to forms closely related to modern genera. The\r\nexistence of the arctic birch and arctic willow, and of shells\r\nbelonging to species now living north of the British Isles, in\r\ndeposits of comparatively recent date in Britain would afford\r\nconvincing evidence of the occurrence of colder climatic conditions\r\nthan those which are now prevalent in the area, even if the evidence\r\nwere not confirmed as it is, by physical proof of glaciation in\r\ndeposits of the same age. Nevertheless, even in these recent beds, we\r\nhave a useful warning, by finding species of elephant and rhinoceros\r\nassociated with northern forms like the lemming, glutton, and musk-ox.\r\nWe know that the species of elephant and rhinoceros (the mammoth and\r\nwoolly rhinoceros) were provided with thick coverings which would\r\nenable them to resist the severity of an arctic climate, but had not\r\nthese coverings been found, we might have been puzzled by the\r\nassociation of forms whose nearest allies are sub-tropical with others\r\nof arctic character. As we go back in time and deal with earlier\r\ndeposits, the ascertainment of the climatic conditions becomes more\r\ndifficult, as the fossils mostly belong to extinct species, genera or\r\neven families.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, it is very dangerous to draw conclusions as to\r\nclimatic conditions from examination of a few forms, but when we find\r\nthat plants and animals, terrestrial and marine forms, vertebrates and\r\ninvertebrates alike point to the same conclusion, as in the London\r\nClay, where all the fossils belong to forms allied to those now living\r\nunder sub-tropical conditions, the state of the climate may be\r\ninferred with considerable certainty[38]. The character of the fossils\r\nmust be taken into account rather than their size. There was a\r\ntendency amongst geologists to believe that large organisms probably\r\nindicate warm conditions. Recent researches in arctic seas have\r\ndispelled this belief. Marine algæ of enormous size are found in the\r\ncold seas, and the size of creatures, abundance of individuals and\r\nvariety of forms in the arctic faunas of some regions is very\r\nnoteworthy. In the Kara Sea, for instance, a variety of creatures were\r\ndredged up during the voyage of the Vega, and Baron Nordenskjöld makes\r\nthe following pertinent remarks about them: \"For the science of our\r\ntime, which so often places the origin of a northern form in the\r\nsouth, and _vice versa_, as the foundation of very wide theoretical\r\nconclusions, a knowledge of the types which can live by turns in\r\nnearly fresh water of a temperature of +10°, and in water cooled down\r\nto -2·7° and of nearly the same salinity as that of the Mediterranean,\r\nmust have a certain interest. The most remarkable were, according to\r\nDr Stuxberg, the following: a species of Mysis, _Diastylis Rathkei_\r\nKr., _Idothea entomon_ Lin., _Idothea Sabinei_ Kr., two species of\r\nLysianassida, _Pontoporeia setosa_ Stbrg., _Halimedon brevicalcar_\r\nGoës, an Annelid, a Molgula, _Yoldia intermedia_ M. Sars, _Yoldia_ (?)\r\n_arctica_ Gray, and a Solecurtus[39]. \"The temperatures were taken by\r\na centigrade thermometer. Again we read of the results of dredging off\r\nCape Chelyuskin. \"The yield of the trawling was extraordinarily\r\nabundant; large asterids, crinoids, sponges, holothuria, a gigantic\r\nsea-spider (Pycnogonid), masses of worms, crustacea, etc. _It was the\r\nmost abundant yield that the trawl-net at any one time brought up\r\nduring the whole of our voyage round the coast of Asia_, and this from\r\nthe sea off the northern extremity of that continent[40].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: For a discussion as to the value of plants as indices of\r\nclimate see Seward, A. C., Sedgwick Essay for 1892.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Nordenskjöld, A. E., _The Voyage of the Vega_, Vol. I.\r\nChap. IV.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: _Ibid._ Chap. VII.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the marine invertebrates reef-building corals and mollusca\r\nperhaps furnish the best evidence of climatic conditions. The\r\ncoral-reefs of the Jurassic rocks with large gastropods and\r\nlamellibranchs clustered around them have been appealed to in proof of\r\nthe existence of sub-tropical conditions during their formation;\r\nfurther back in time we find evidence of climate furnished by the\r\nfossils of the Silurian rocks of the Isle of Gothland in the Baltic\r\nSea. Of these, Lindström writes \"_The fauna had a tropical character_.\r\nIn consideration of the great numbers of Pleurotomariae, Trochi,\r\nTurbinidae and the large Pteropods the assumption of a tropical\r\ncharacter of the fauna may seem justifiable[41].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Lindström, G., _On the Silurian Gastropoda and Pteropoda\r\nof Gotland_, Stockholm, 1884, p. 33.]\r\n\r\nStructure may give some indication of climate even though the organism\r\nis not allied to living species. The bark of trees in arctic regions\r\nis often thicker than in more temperate regions, and the leaves of\r\narctic plants often have special characters to enable them to resist\r\nthe long periods during which they are deprived of water, though the\r\nfact that desert-plants frequently shew similar modifications deprives\r\nthis test of any particular value except as a means of corroborating\r\nconclusions reached from other evidence[42]. The shells of arctic\r\nmollusca may become stunted, but this is not by any means universal,\r\nand the same result may be brought about by other abnormal conditions,\r\nas for instance the increase of salt in a water area by evaporation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: For an account of the modifications of the leaves of\r\narctic plants, see Warming, Eug., _Om Grønlands Vegetation_,\r\nMeddelelser om Grønland, 12th part, p. 105.]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, an examination of the evidence available for\r\nascertaining the character of climate by reference to included\r\norganisms, shews that inferences may be drawn within certain limits,\r\nbut that the task is a difficult one not unaccompanied by danger, and\r\nevery kind of available evidence derived from a study of physical\r\nphenomena and the included organisms should be utilised before any\r\nconclusion is drawn.\r\n\r\nThe likelihood of accurate inference is increased by comparing the\r\nfaunas of various areas; should they seem to indicate a progressive\r\nlowering of climate when passing from lower to higher latitudes, it is\r\nprobable that the indication is correct. The student is referred to a\r\npaper by the late Professor Neumayr for an account of the existence of\r\nclimatic zones during the Mesozoic Period[43].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Neumayr, M., \"Ueber klimatische Zonen während der Jura-\r\nund Kreidezeit,\" _Denkschrift. der Math.-Naturwissensch. Classe der k.\r\nAkad. der Wissenschaften_, Bd. XLVII. Vienna, 1883.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nEVIDENCES OF CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH STRATA WERE FORMED, CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter, attention was drawn to the indications as to\r\nconditions of deposition furnished by the sediments of any one\r\nlocality, and only passing reference was made to variation in the\r\nnature of the sediments and their organic contents, when the deposits\r\nare traced laterally from place to place; some attention must now be\r\npaid to this matter.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes inferred that, whereas similarity of organisms is a\r\ndangerous guide in correlating the strata of two areas, accurate\r\ncorrelations may be made, if the deposits can be traced continuously\r\nthrough the intervening interval; no doubt the task is simplified when\r\nthis can be done, but the continuity of deposit of one particular\r\ncomposition is no more proof of contemporaneity than the occurrence of\r\nthe same fossils continuously through the interval, imbedded in strata\r\nof different character, indeed probably not so much so. The existence\r\nof widespread masses of conglomerate, which are not found as linear\r\nstrips, but which extend in all directions, is in itself an indication\r\nof this; the Oldhaven pebble bed for instance, in the Tertiary rocks\r\nof the London basin, is very widely distributed. We cannot suppose\r\nthat coastal conditions prevailed far away from the shore-line, and\r\naccordingly when a conglomerate occurs in a widespread sheet, and not\r\nin a linear strip, this is indicative that the deposit has not been\r\nformed continuously but that strip has been added to strip along an\r\nadvancing or receding shore line, and if this happens with\r\nconglomerates, it must occur also in the case of other deposits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\nIn fig. 13[44] let _A_ represent a shore line of a continent which is\r\nundergoing gradual elevation. A deposit of pebbles _a_ will be formed\r\nagainst the coast, one of sand _b_ further away, then one of mud _c_\r\nand lastly limestone _d_, may be formed in the open sea away from\r\nland. Naturally there may be intermingling of two kinds of deposit at\r\nthe junctions, but for the sake of simplicity this may be disregarded.\r\nDuring the accumulation of the deposits _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, certain\r\nsporadic forms may be distributed throughout all the deposits, and\r\nsome of them may become extinct before the deposition of these beds is\r\ncompleted, if the process is carried out on a large scale; we may\r\nspeak of the characteristic fossils of this period as fauna I. As the\r\nresult of elevation or of mere silting up of the sea-margin, or of\r\nboth combined, the next mass of pebble-deposit will be laid down\r\nfurther away from the original shore, for the shore line will now be\r\nat _A´_ and not at _A_, and it will partly overlap the mass of sand\r\n_b_; the sand _b_^1 will also be deposited somewhat further out and\r\npartly overlap the mud _c_, and similarly the mud _c_^{1} will partly\r\noverlie the limestone _d_. During the formation of _a_^{1}, _b_^{1},\r\n_c_^{1}, _d_^{1}, other sporadic forms belonging to a fauna II may\r\nreplace those of the first fauna. In the same way _a_^{2}, _b_^{2},\r\n_c_^{2}, _d_^{2} will be deposited, and in the meantime a new fauna\r\nIII may arise and replace II. So the process will go on until we\r\nfinally have a group of deposits lying one over the other, consisting\r\nof a basal accumulation of limestone, succeeded by mud, sandstone and\r\npebble-beds in succession. Each of these will be continuous, though\r\nthe inner part of the pebble-deposit was formed long before the outer\r\npart of the limestone, which is nevertheless beneath a mass of\r\npebble-deposit continuous with that formed first, and the various\r\ndeposits will be separated by fairly horizontal planes _x_, _y_, _z_,\r\nwhich might be regarded as bedding planes, but which are not so,\r\nstrictly speaking. The true bedding planes will occur at a slight\r\nangle to these planes of separation, for the structure resembles false\r\nbedding on a gigantic scale, but of course, the lines separating two\r\nmasses of similar deposit will be practically horizontal and parallel\r\nto the planes of demarcation of two distinct kinds of material. The\r\nlines separating two faunas would, under the conditions postulated,\r\nrun approximately parallel to the planes of separation of adjoining\r\ndeposits of the same lithological character but would pass from\r\nconglomerate, through sandstone, mud and limestone, as indicated by\r\nthe lines 1, 2, 3, ... and the deposits between adjoining lines would\r\nbe contemporaneous[45]. In nature, complications will arise, owing to\r\nthe gradual appearance and disappearance of forms, and the existence\r\nof endemic species in contemporaneous deposits formed in different\r\nstations and having different lithological characters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: The writer gratefully acknowledges his indebtedness to\r\nProf. Lapworth for some of his views concerning deposition of strata.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: The lines 1, 2, 3 ... are incorrectly drawn in the\r\nfigure. Line 1 should be drawn so as to separate _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_\r\nfrom _a_^{1}, _b_^{1}, _c_^{1}, _d_^{1}, line 2 to separate _a_^{1},\r\n_b_^{1}, _c_^{1}, _d_^{1} from _a_^{2}, _b_^{2}, _c_^{2}, _d_^{2}, and\r\nso with the others.]\r\n\r\nIf elevation ceased and were succeeded by depression, the exact\r\nopposite would occur, and the pebble beds would be overlain by\r\nsandstones, these by muds, and lastly limestones would appear. It\r\nfollows that during a marine phase occurring between two\r\nunconformities we should have a =V=-shaped accumulation of deposits\r\nwith the apex pointing to the part of the shore line which was last\r\nsubmerged before the commencement of elevation, as shewn in fig. 14,\r\nthough the beds of the apex will in most cases be denuded during the\r\nre-emergence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\nIndications of the non-coincidence of the planes separating faunas and\r\nthose which separate deposits of one lithological character from those\r\nof another have already been detected, for instance the 'greensand'\r\ncondition of the Cretaceous period occurs in some places during the\r\nexistence of one fauna, and in others during that of another, though\r\nthe planes have not been traced continuously. Mr Lamplugh has\r\nfurnished another example amongst the Cretaceous rocks of Yorkshire\r\nand Lincolnshire, but as has already been observed, a great deal\r\nremains to be done in this direction, and geologists are much in want\r\nof two sets of stratigraphical maps, in one of which the lines are\r\ndrawn with reference to the differences of lithological character,\r\nwhilst in the other they separate different faunas.\r\n\r\nThe student will notice the normal recurrence of deposits in definite\r\norder; conglomerate succeeded by sandstone, mud and limestone, in a\r\nsinking area, and limestone succeeded by mud, sandstone and\r\nconglomerate in a rising area. Naturally many instances of departure\r\nfrom this rule are seen, owing to local conditions, but on a large\r\nscale, it is very frequently noted, and recognition of this will\r\nenable the student to remember the variations in the lithological\r\ncharacters of the deposits more easily, than if he simply acquired\r\nthem from a text-book without taking heed as to their significance.\r\n\r\nUpon the variations in the lithological characters of deposits and of\r\ntheir faunas, when the beds are traced laterally depends very largely\r\nthe successful ascertainment of the existence of former coast-lines,\r\nthe restoration of which constitutes an important part, of\r\nPalæo-physiography, concerning which some observations may here be\r\nmade[46]. If a set of deposits having different lithological\r\ncharacters can be proved to be contemporaneous, the coarser detrital\r\naccumulations will point to the approach to a coast-line, and the\r\nactual position of the coast during the period of accumulation of the\r\ndeposits may be very accurately fixed. The pebble-beds at the base of\r\nthe Cambrian rocks of Llanberis indicate the existence of a\r\ncoast-line in that position during the accumulation of those\r\npebble-beds. Similar pebble-beds occur at St David's, at the base of\r\nthe Cambrian, but it is impossible in the case of these rapidly\r\naccumulated sediments to say that two deposited so far away from one\r\nanother were actually contemporaneous, and therefore although we\r\nmight draw a line through Llanberis and St David's to indicate the\r\nold coast-line of the period, it does not follow that the actual\r\nbeach existed simultaneously at the positions indicated. The\r\npalæo-physiographer, however, attempts to restore the physical\r\nconditions of greater thicknesses of deposit; for instance, the\r\ndistribution of land and sea during Lower Carboniferous times over the\r\narea now occupied by the British Isles is often taken to illustrate\r\nthe methods of restoration of ancient features, and all admit that the\r\nlithological and palæontological characters of the rocks indicate a\r\nshallowing of the Carboniferous sea when passing northwards towards\r\nScotland. For conveying an idea of the restorations to the student, it\r\nis almost imperative to portray the distribution of land and sea upon\r\na map, and this can only be done by drawing definite lines. It must be\r\ndistinctly understood that these lines are necessarily only an\r\napproximation to the actual position of the ancient shore-lines, which\r\nmust have shifted again and again during the long period occupied by\r\nthe accumulation of the Lower Carboniferous strata, so that a true\r\nidea of the positions of the Lower Carboniferous shore-lines could\r\nonly be obtained by placing on a series of maps the successive\r\nshore-lines of different parts of the Lower Carboniferous period, and\r\ntaking a composite photograph of these, which would appear as a wide\r\nbelt of shaded portion of the map with no definite boundaries. The\r\nutmost that the maker of palæo-physiographical maps can expect to\r\nindicate, when dealing with considerable thicknesses of strata, is an\r\napproximation to the mean position of the shore-lines of the period\r\nwhen these strata were deposited. This is extremely valuable in\r\nenabling the student to understand the significance of the variations\r\nin the characters of the strata and their organic contents, if he\r\ndistinctly recognises the generalised nature of the map. Examination\r\nof any two palæo-physiographical maps of the same period by different\r\nauthors will shew wide divergences in the details, but a general\r\nresemblance of the main features. The reader will do well to consult\r\nProf. Hull's restoration of the physical features of Old Red Sandstone\r\nand Lower Carboniferous Times on Plate VI. of his _Contributions to\r\nthe Physical History of the British Isles_, and compare it with the\r\nmap drawn by Prof. Green (_Coal: its History and Uses_, by Profs.\r\nGreen, Miall, Thorpe, Rücker, and Marshall, Fig. 3, p. 38), which will\r\nbe found to bear out this statement.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: On this subject, the student may consult Prof. E. Hull's\r\n_Contributions to the Physical History of the British Isles_.]\r\n\r\nValuable as the published maps of palæo-physiography are as an aid to\r\nthe student in understanding the significance of the variations of\r\ncharacters amongst the sediments, he will do well to supplement them\r\nby maps which he fills in for himself. He is recommended to procure a\r\nnumber of outline maps of England, or of the British Isles, and when\r\nstudying in detail the characters of the British sedimentary rocks\r\nformed during the various periods, to place a blank map by his side\r\nwhen beginning the study of each period or important portion of a\r\nperiod. On this map he should jot down the geographical distribution\r\nof the different kinds of sediments, using the conventional signs\r\nindicated at p. 90: thus, in the case of the Lower Carboniferous\r\nrocks he would place the conventional sign for limestone in\r\nDerbyshire, a combination of those for limestone and shale in\r\nYorkshire, and would add to these the sandstone sign in\r\nNorthumberland. He should also note the general character of the\r\nfossils, using abbreviations for such terms as fresh-water fossils,\r\nshallow-sea fossils, deep-water fossils. After reading the account of\r\nthe group of rocks in a comprehensive text-book, and inserting his\r\nnotes on the map, he should proceed to insert the probable position of\r\nthe coast-lines. He should also take notes of any indications of\r\ncontemporaneous volcanic action, though these might well be inserted\r\non a separate map. If this course be pursued, the student will not\r\nonly have the significance of the variations amongst the strata\r\nimpressed upon his mind, but he will have a means of obtaining at a\r\nglance the distribution of sediments and faunas of different kinds in\r\nthe British area during the principal geological periods. On another\r\nset of maps he may indicate the axes of the orogenic movements which\r\nhave occurred at different times, and when his various maps are\r\ncompleted, he will have the materials for the construction of a\r\ngeneral account of the various geological processes which have been\r\nconcerned with the building of the British area.\r\n\r\nWhen an area like Britain has been studied, the student may proceed to\r\nconstruction of maps of wider regions, and he will find that in doing\r\nthis, new sets of facts must be taken into consideration, as for\r\ninstance the occurrence of different faunas on opposite sides of\r\nonce-existing continental masses, and the problems connected with the\r\npresent distribution of the faunas and floras. For an instance of the\r\nimportance of the former distribution of life the reader may consult\r\nthe twelfth section of the first part of Professor Suess' _Das\r\nAntlitz der Erde_, whilst a good account of the value of recent\r\ngeographical distribution of organisms in supplying a clue to former\r\ndistribution of land and sea will be found in Mr A. R. Wallace's\r\n_Island Life_, Chapter xxii.\r\n\r\nShould the method suggested above be adopted, the student is likely to\r\nacquire a much more coherent idea of the significance of the facts of\r\nstratigraphical geology than can be obtained by a mere perusal of the\r\naccounts of the strata given in those portions of the various\r\ntext-books which are devoted to a consideration of the stratigraphical\r\nbranch of the science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE CLASSIFICATION OF THE STRATIFIED ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding chapters, a general account of the characters of the\r\nGeological Deposits of different periods will be given, for the\r\npurposes of illustrating the principles to the consideration of which\r\nthe earlier chapters have been devoted. It is not proposed to enter\r\ninto a description of numberless details, which would only confuse the\r\nstudent who wished to grasp the main principles, for many facts have\r\nbeen recorded which it is necessary to notice in a comprehensive\r\ntext-book treating of stratigraphical geology, though their full\r\nsignificance is not yet grasped. The writer, while noting the main\r\ncharacters of the various subdivisions of the different\r\nstratigraphical systems, will assume that this work is used in\r\nconjunction with some recognised text-book. The stratigraphical\r\nportion of Sir A. Geikie's _Class Book of Geology_ gives an admirable\r\ngeneral account of the British Strata, while the larger text-book by\r\nthe same author has a condensed though very full account of the rocks\r\nof the stratigraphical column in all parts of the world, and this is\r\nsupplemented by numerous references to the original works wherein\r\nfurther descriptions may be found. The English edition of Prof. E.\r\nKayser's _Text-Book of Comparative Geology_, edited by P. Lake, is\r\nalso well adapted to the wants of the student, and an excellent\r\naccount of the strata is given in Mr A. J. Jukes-Browne's _Handbook of\r\nHistorical Geology_, which may be read with the same author's\r\n_Building of the British Isles_.\r\n\r\nThe reader who refers to different text-books will be struck with the\r\nvariations of nomenclature even amongst the larger stratigraphical\r\ndivisions, for two authors seldom subdivide the geological column into\r\nthe same number of rock-systems. The following classification will be\r\nhere adopted:--\r\n\r\n  Groups.              Systems.\r\n\r\n                  { Recent\r\n                  { Pleistocene\r\n  Cainozoic or    { Pliocene\r\n  Tertiary        { Miocene\r\n                  { Oligocene\r\n                  { Eocene\r\n\r\n                  { Cretaceous\r\n  Mesozoic or     { Jurassic\r\n  Secondary       { Triassic\r\n\r\n                  { Permian\r\n                  { Permo-Carboniferous\r\n                  { Carboniferous\r\n  Palæozoic       { Devonian\r\n                  { Silurian\r\n                  { Ordovician\r\n                  { Cambrian.\r\n\r\n  Precambrian.\r\n\r\nA few remarks may be given as to the reason for adopting this\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nIt is not for a moment suggested that the Systems have the same value,\r\nif the time taken for their accumulation be alone considered. The beds\r\nclassified as Recent, for example, were probably accumulated during a\r\nlapse of time far shorter than that occupied for the deposit of some\r\nof the series or even stages of a system like the Silurian, but the\r\nrecent rocks acquire a special significance from the fact that we are\r\nliving in the period, and the Cainozoic rocks as a whole are capable\r\nof greater subdivision than the earlier groups, on account of the\r\ngreater ease with which they can be studied, owing to the small amount\r\nof disturbance which they have usually undergone when compared with\r\nthat which has affected older rocks, and the closer resemblance of\r\ntheir faunas and floras to those of existing times.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the groups, the writer has already commented upon\r\nthe use of the terms Palæozoic, Mesozoic and Cainozoic; below the\r\nlowest Palæozoic rocks (those of the Cambrian system) lie a group of\r\nrocks which have been variously spoken of as Azoic, Eozoic, and\r\nArchæan. There is an objection to the use of any one of these words in\r\nthis sense; the objection in the case of the first two is that the\r\nterm is theoretical and probably incorrect, whilst the word Archæan,\r\notherwise suitable, has also been used in a more restricted sense. In\r\nthese circumstances the term Precambrian will be used when referring\r\nto any rocks which were formed below Palæozoic times, though no doubt\r\nwhen this obscure group of rocks is more thoroughly understood a\r\nsatisfactory classification will be applied to it.\r\n\r\nTaking the other groups into account, the lower systems of the\r\nPalæozoic group will be found to vary greatly according to the views\r\nof different writers; some make only one system, the Silurian, others\r\ntwo, the Cambrian and Silurian. The three systems are here adopted,\r\nnot only because the one, Silurian, is too unwieldy on account of its\r\nsize and requires subdivision (and the Cambrian and Silurian however\r\ndefined, will be found to be of very unequal importance, whereas the\r\nthree systems adopted are of fairly equal value), but especially\r\nbecause when the term Ordovician is used, the significance of the\r\nother terms Cambrian and Silurian is at once understood.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made to shew that the Devonian system is\r\nnon-existent, but the result of modern research is to shew that the\r\nrocks placed in this system are worthy of the distinction, both from\r\ntheir importance and from the distinctness of the fauna from those of\r\nthe underlying and overlying systems.\r\n\r\nThe Permo-Carboniferous system is adopted, because an important group\r\nof deposits has recently been brought to light which were not\r\nrepresented either in the Permian or Carboniferous system as\r\noriginally defined.\r\n\r\nSome authors have advocated the union of the Permian and Triassic\r\nsystems into one system placed at the base of the Mesozoic group. This\r\nis unnecessary, and would depart from the classification originally\r\nproposed, which is to be deprecated, unless there is any strong reason\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nThe Mesozoic systems are classified according to the method generally\r\nadopted. Were a fresh classification to be proposed, a portion of the\r\nCretaceous system might be included with the Jurassic rocks, but it is\r\nbetter to adhere to the old classification.\r\n\r\nThe divisions of the Cainozoic rocks are hardly systems in the sense\r\nin which the term is used in the case of the older rocks, but the\r\nreason for using these smaller subdivisions has already been\r\nmentioned. The addition of the Oligocene to the original divisions\r\nsuggested by Lyell has been found useful, and the term will be used\r\nin this work.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the adoption of the particular minor subdivisions\r\n(series and stages) in the following chapters will frequently appear\r\nwhen the rocks of the various systems are described, and need not be\r\nfurther alluded to in this place.\r\n\r\nAlthough most geologists describe the stratified rocks in ascending\r\nsequence beginning with the oldest, and proceeding towards the newest,\r\nothers, and notably Lyell, adopted the opposite method and commenced\r\nwith an account of the newest beds. The argument generally used for\r\nthe latter method is that it is easier to work from the study of the\r\nknown to that of the less known, and as the faunas of the newest rocks\r\nare most like the existing faunas, the student would more readily\r\nfollow a description of the rocks in the order which is opposite to\r\nthat in which they were deposited.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the study of the sediments in their proper order, that\r\nis, in the order of deposit, will not be found to task the student to\r\nany great extent, especially if, as is very desirable, he has studied\r\nthe main facts and principles of Palæontology before commencing the\r\nstudy of the rock-systems in detail. There is one reason for beginning\r\nwith the study of the older sediments which outweighs any reasons\r\nwhich can be advanced against it, namely that the events of any period\r\nproduce their effect not only upon the strata of that period, but also\r\non those of succeeding periods.\r\n\r\nThe task of the stratigraphical geologist is really to learn the\r\nevolution of the earth, in its changes from the simple to the more\r\ncomplex conditions, and it is quite obvious that it is unnatural to\r\nattempt any study of evolution by working backward. For this reason\r\nthe study of the sediments will be here made in the order which is\r\nusually adopted, by passing from the older to the newer, and from the\r\nsimple to the more complex.\r\n\r\nThe British strata will be mainly considered, though references will\r\nfrequently be made to their foreign equivalents, and a fuller account\r\nof the latter will be added when the British strata are abnormal, as\r\nare those of Triassic times, and also when a period is not represented\r\namongst the strata of the British Isles, as for instance, the\r\nPermo-Carboniferous and Miocene periods.\r\n\r\nThe student is recommended to refer constantly to good geological maps\r\nof the British Isles, of Europe, and of the world. Of maps of the\r\nBritish Isles, mention may be made of Sir A. Ramsay's geological map\r\nof England, Sir A. Geikie's map of Scotland, and his map of the\r\nBritish Isles, J. G. Goodchild's map of England and Wales, a map of\r\nEurope by W. Topley and one of the world reduced from that by J.\r\nMarcou, accompanying the first and second volumes of the late Sir J.\r\nPrestwich's _Geology_. For special purposes more detailed maps will be\r\nstudied, including the one-inch maps of H. M. Geological Survey, and\r\nthe index map on a smaller scale. Lastly, for an account of British\r\nGeology, reference must be made to H. B. Woodward's _Geology of\r\nEngland and Wales_, where the British formations are described in\r\norder, and to W. J. Harrison's _Geology of the Counties of England and\r\nWales_, where the stratigraphical geology of the country is given\r\nunder the head of the different counties, which are taken in\r\nalphabetical order.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this chapter, it is hardly necessary to say that every\r\nopportunity of studying the characters of the deposits and their\r\nfossils in the field should be eagerly seized, and that much\r\ninformation may be acquired even on a railway journey, especially as\r\nto the influence which the deposits exert upon the scenery of a\r\nregion[47].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: In the first edition of H. B. Woodward's _Geology of\r\nEngland and Wales_, an account of the geology of the main lines of\r\nEnglish railways is given, which is omitted in the later edition. It\r\nis well worth consulting by those who take a long journey, and it will\r\nbe found useful to take a geological map with one on the journey so as\r\nto discover when one is passing from one formation to another.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE PRECAMBRIAN ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nStudy of a geological map of the world will shew that extensive\r\nregions, such as parts of Scandinavia, many tracts of Central Europe,\r\na large area in Canada, and a considerable portion of Brazil and the\r\nadjoining countries are occupied by crystalline schists, which\r\nunderlie the oldest known sedimentary strata in those places. These\r\ncrystalline schists form the floor upon which the sediments\r\nconstituting the bulk of the geological column rest, and it is\r\nnecessary that we should know something of the character of this\r\nfloor. Other rocks which can be definitely proved to be of Precambrian\r\nage are often found associated with the crystalline schists, and these\r\nassociated rocks have often undergone more or less alteration\r\nsubsequently to their formation. The difference between the coarser\r\ntypes of crystalline schists and these associated rocks is sometimes\r\nso marked that geologists have necessarily paid attention to it, and\r\nseparated the two groups of rocks; the term Archæan has been used by\r\nsome geologists to include the crystalline schists, and Eparchæan for\r\nthe associated rocks of known Precambrian age, but though this\r\nseparation may sometimes be effected, there are cases when it is\r\nimpossible to draw any sharp line of demarcation between 'Archæan'\r\nand 'Eparchæan' types.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of our knowledge, a chronological classification\r\nof the Precambrian rocks when applied to wide and distant regions is\r\ndestined to break down, and it will be convenient if we consider at\r\nsome length the features of the Precambrian rocks of a particular\r\nregion, and apply the knowledge thus gained to a study of Precambrian\r\nrocks of other areas, and to a consideration of our knowledge of the\r\nPrecambrian rocks as a whole. In doing so, the term 'crystalline\r\nschists' will be used somewhat vaguely with reference to a complex of\r\nschistose rocks of which the mode of origin cannot be fully\r\ndetermined. We may take our own country as a region where a good\r\ndevelopment of the Precambrian rocks occurs.\r\n\r\nA few explanatory remarks concerning the mode of detection of\r\nPrecambrian rocks may not be amiss. If any true organisms have been\r\nhitherto discovered amongst the rocks formed before Cambrian times\r\nthey are valueless as a means of correlating rocks, and accordingly\r\nlithological characters only are available in attempting to correlate\r\nthe rocks of one area with those of another. Those who have read the\r\npreceding chapters will have gathered that comparisons founded on\r\nsimilarity of lithological character are not so valuable as those made\r\nafter careful scrutiny of the fossils of strata, but they are by no\r\nmeans valueless, and when the rocks of two areas which are not far\r\ndistant from one another present close lithological resemblances,\r\ntheir general contemporaneity may be inferred with some degree of\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nIt is only when we get the lowest Cambrian strata overlying earlier\r\nrocks that we have absolute proof of the Precambrian age of the\r\nlatter, and it is necessary, therefore, that we should have some\r\ndefinite lower limit to the rocks of the Cambrian system. It is now\r\ngenerally agreed that that limit shall be drawn at the base of a group\r\nof rocks containing what is known as the _Olenellus_-fauna, which will\r\nbe considered at greater length in the next chapter, and it will be\r\nwell, if the term Cambrian be not in future applied to any rocks\r\nbeneath the ones containing the relics of this fauna, for otherwise\r\nthere is danger of the indefinite downward extension of the Cambrian\r\nsystem. We need not be surprised to find great thicknesses of rock\r\nbelow the rocks containing the _Olenellus_-fauna, and passing upwards\r\nwith complete conformity into those rocks; nevertheless, if it can be\r\nshewn that the _Olenellus_-fauna had not appeared during the\r\ndeposition of the underlying group, the rocks of that group should be\r\ntermed Precambrian. A case of this nature has not yet been detected in\r\nour area, and all the rocks which have been proved to be Precambrian\r\nin Britain are separated from the overlying Cambrian rocks by a\r\nphysical break, though that break is not necessarily very large, and\r\nin some districts is probably of little importance. Hitherto the\r\n_Olenellus_-fauna has been detected in Ross, Warwickshire, Shropshire,\r\nWorcestershire and probably in Pembrokeshire, and the rocks underlying\r\nthe _Olenellus_-beds in those counties can be proved to be Precambrian\r\n(i.e. if the _Olenellus_-age of the Pembrokeshire rocks be ultimately\r\nestablished, and the researches of Dr Hicks tend to prove that it will\r\nalmost certainly be done). It will be convenient if we take the\r\ninstances where the age of the rocks can be proved with certainty or\r\nwith a considerable degree of probability first, and then consider the\r\nexamples of rocks which are found below Cambrian strata, though these\r\nhave not hitherto yielded the _Olenellus_-fauna, concluding with a\r\nnotice of rocks which have been claimed to be of Precambrian age on\r\naccount of their lithological characters, though they are not now seen\r\nto be immediately succeeded by strata appertaining to the Cambrian\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nCommencing with the region where we have the greatest development of\r\nthe known Precambrian rocks, namely Ross, Sutherland and the Hebrides,\r\nwe may explain the general relationship of the rocks by means of a\r\ngeneralised section (fig. 15).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\nThe lowest rocks _a_ are crystalline schists, they are succeeded by a\r\nset of arenaceous rocks _b_ known as the Torridonian beds, which rest\r\nunconformably upon the upturned edges of the crystalline schists,\r\nwhilst the Cambrian rocks, _c_, rest with another unconformity\r\nsometimes upon the partly denuded Torridonian beds, or where the\r\nlatter have been completely removed, as on the right side of the\r\nfigure, directly upon the crystalline schists, thus presenting an\r\nexample of unconformable overlap. The occurrence of the\r\n_Olenellus_-fauna in the basement beds of the Cambrian system near\r\nLoch Maree, proves the Precambrian age of the Torridonian strata,\r\nwhilst the unconformable junction between the latter and the\r\ncrystalline schists indicates that we are here dealing with two\r\ndistinct sets of Precambrian rocks, one of Eparchæan and the other of\r\nArchæan type.\r\n\r\nThe crystalline schists consist of rocks of very varied lithological\r\ncharacters, some with gneissose, and others with schistose structure,\r\nand they vary in degree of acidity from ultrabasic rocks to those of\r\nacid composition. Most of them exhibit parallel structures, which in\r\nmany cases can be shewn to have been impressed on the rocks\r\nsubsequently to their consolidation, though this need not have\r\noccurred and probably did not occur with some of them, especially the\r\ngranitoid gneisses. The researches of the members of H. M. Geological\r\nSurvey have shewn that many of these rocks were originally intrusive\r\nigneous rocks, though it is not yet known into what rocks those which\r\nwere first consolidated were injected, and the origin of the bulk of\r\nthe schists still remains to be elucidated. Subsequently to their\r\nconsolidation and before the deposition of the earliest Torridonian\r\nrocks they were subjected to more than one set of earth-movements,\r\nwhich folded them and impressed a series of parallel structures upon\r\nmany of them; and accordingly we find that the pebbles of the\r\ncrystalline schists which are found amongst the basal conglomerates of\r\nthe Torridonian rocks consist of fragments which had undergone the\r\nalteration caused by these earth-movements before they were denuded\r\nfrom their parent-rocks[48].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: For an account of these rocks, their characters, and the\r\neffects of earth movement upon them, the reader should consult a\r\n\"Report on the Recent Work of the Geological Survey in the North-West\r\nHighlands of Scotland\": _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. XLIV. p.\r\n378.]\r\n\r\nThe Torridonian system is composed of rocks which are largely of\r\narenaceous character, the most prominent beds being formed of red\r\nsandstones, and the bulk of the fragments in them have clearly been\r\nderived by denudation from the crystalline schists, many of the beds\r\nbeing composed of arkose, where the quartz is mixed with a large\r\nproportion of felspar and often of ferro-magnesian minerals. The\r\ndeposits are clearly sedimentary, and are as little altered as many\r\nstrata of much more recent origin, only possessing structures produced\r\nby metamorphic action under exceptional circumstances. The detailed\r\nresearches of the geological surveyors prove that the rocks of this\r\nsystem have a much greater thickness and are of more varied\r\nlithological characters than was previously supposed. The total\r\nthickness of the strata is over 10,000 feet, and the sandstones are\r\nassociated with deposits of a muddy character, and with occasional\r\nbands of limestone; in these circumstances the discovery of fossils\r\nwould excite no surprise, and in 1891 Sir A. Geikie announced the\r\ndetection of \"traces of annelids and some more obscure remains of\r\nother organisms in these strata,\" which have not yet been\r\ndescribed[49]. These Torridonian strata furnish us with the most\r\nsatisfactory group of Precambrian sediments yet detected in\r\nBritain[50].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: An account of the subdivisions and lithological\r\ncharacters of the rocks of the Torridonian System will be found in the\r\n_Annual Report of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom_ for\r\n1893.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: It has been recently maintained that some of the\r\nTorridonian rocks are of Æolian origin.]\r\n\r\nIn the south-east Highlands is a great mass of crystalline schists of\r\na less gneissose character than that of the north-west, to which Sir\r\nA. Geikie has applied the name Dalradian. Many of these schists will\r\nbe found by examination of the geological map of Scotland to be\r\nseparable into divisions, which by means of their lithological\r\ncharacters can be traced long distances across the country, and they\r\npresent all the characters of sedimentary rocks, though they are\r\nassociated with intrusive igneous rocks, and have undergone great\r\nmetamorphic changes since their formation. Cambrian rocks have not yet\r\nbeen discovered immediately above them, though they are clearly older\r\nthan Ordovician times, but the existence of rocks associated with them\r\nalong their north-west borders, which in lithological characters\r\nclosely resemble some of the rocks of the crystalline schists of the\r\nnorth-west Highlands, indicates the probability of their general\r\nPrecambrian age. In some instances, the extreme types of metamorphism\r\nwhich they exhibit are the result of the kind of action usually termed\r\npyrometamorphic as has been shewn by Mr G. Barrow[51].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Barrow, G. \"On an Intrusion of Muscovite-biotite gneiss\r\nin the S.E. Highlands of Scotland, and its accompanying metamorphism.\"\r\n_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. XLIX. p. 330.]\r\n\r\nIn England and Wales the rocks which have been shewn or inferred to be\r\nPrecambrian, when not intrusive, are largely of volcanic origin. The\r\nmost satisfactory example of the occurrence of the _Olenellus_-fauna\r\nis that of the Cambrian Comley sandstone of Shropshire, which rests\r\nunconformably upon a set of rocks termed by Dr Callaway the Uriconian\r\nrocks; the latter are essentially volcanic, and strongly resemble\r\nPrecambrian rocks of other British areas. There is also strong reason\r\nto suppose that the sediments to which the name Longmyndian has been\r\napplied, which have been described by the Rev. J. F. Blake, are of\r\nPrecambrian age, for, as Professor Lapworth has pointed out, the three\r\ngreat subdivisions of the Cambrian system are present in the area\r\nunder consideration, and the rocks of each are entirely different from\r\nthose of the adjoining Longmynd area. In Shropshire therefore we meet\r\nwith one set of volcanic rocks, and another set consisting of\r\nsedimentary rocks, of which the former is certainly, the latter\r\nalmost certainly of Precambrian age, and as the Longmyndian rocks are\r\nin a comparatively unaltered condition, consisting of normal\r\nsediments, we may well expect the discovery of fossils in them\r\nalso[52]. The _Olenellus_-fauna has been found near Nuneaton in\r\nWarwickshire in beds which unconformably succeed volcanic rocks, the\r\nCaldecote series of Prof. Lapworth, and the latter are therefore of\r\nPrecambrian age[53]. A few fossils belonging to the _Olenellus_-fauna\r\nhave occurred in the oldest Cambrian rocks of the Malvern district,\r\nand these rocks rest unconformably upon those of an old ridge which is\r\ntherefore composed of Precambrian rocks. The rocks of this ridge are\r\nlargely of intrusive igneous origin, though parallel structures have\r\nbeen impressed upon them as the result of subsequent deformation, but\r\nsome of the rocks are almost certainly of contemporaneous volcanic\r\norigin[54]. In the Wrekin ridge, igneous and pyroclastic rocks are\r\nfound succeeded unconformably by Cambrian rocks which resemble those\r\nof the Malvern and Nuneaton districts, and probably belong to the\r\nperiod of existence of the _Olenellus_-fauna, and these igneous and\r\npyroclastic rocks are presumably of Precambrian age, and the\r\ncontemporaneous rocks constitute Dr Callaway's typical Uriconian\r\ngroup. Volcanic ashes and breccias are accompanied by devitrified\r\npitchstones and intruded granitic rocks, which may or may not be all\r\nof the same general age[55]. The rocks which have been claimed as\r\nPrecambrian in Pembrokeshire and in Caernarvonshire have the same\r\ngeneral characters as those of the Wrekin ridge. Pyroclastic rocks\r\nunderlie the oldest Cambrian rocks, with discordance between the two,\r\nand associated with these pyroclastic rocks are quartz felsites which\r\naccording to some are of contemporaneous nature whilst others maintain\r\ntheir intrusive origin. In each county granites are found which are\r\nnow generally recognised to be intrusive, though there seems to be no\r\ndoubt as to their being of the same general age as the rocks with\r\nwhich they are associated, and therefore presumably Precambrian. The\r\nPembrokeshire rocks are marked by the occurrence of a certain amount\r\nof metamorphism, probably of more than one kind, which has converted\r\npyroclastic volcanic rocks into sericitic-schists and quartz-felsites\r\ninto hälleflintas[56]. The term Pebidian given by Dr Hicks to the\r\ncontemporaneous volcanic fragmental rocks should be retained, and if\r\nthese rocks be eventually shewn to be contemporaneous with similar\r\nvolcanic rocks of other districts, may be applied generally, as it has\r\npriority over other terms as Uriconian and Caldecote series. The term\r\nDimetian was applied to rocks known to be intrusive, and must be\r\ndropped as a chronological term, whilst the existence of an Arvonian\r\nsystem separate from the Pebidian system is not fully proved.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: The reader may consult a paper by Prof. Lapworth \"On\r\n_Olenellus Callavei_ and its geological relationships,\" _Geol.

XXXV. p.\r\n643.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: The Pembrokeshire area is of interest as the probable\r\nexistence of Precambrian rocks in Britain was first indicated on good\r\nevidence in this county. The general structure of the district is\r\nfairly simple, consisting of Cambrian rocks beneath which Precambrian\r\nrocks are exposed in at least two ridges of which the northerly and\r\nmore important one runs through St Davids. The rocks of the St Davids\r\nridge consist of a binary granite (granitoidite), felsites, and\r\nvolcanic ashes and breccias of intermediate composition. Much\r\ndiversity of opinion has existed, and to some extent still exists as\r\nto questions of detail, and a very extensive literature has been\r\ndevoted to these rocks. Amongst the numerous papers which treat of\r\nthem, the student may consult the following:--Hicks, H., _Quart.\r\nJourn. Geol. Soc._, vol. XXXIII. p. 229, XXXIV. p. 147, XXXV. p. 285,\r\nXL. p. 507, XLII. p. 351, Geikie, A., _ibid._ vol. XXXIV. p. 261,\r\nBlake, J. F., _ibid._ vol. XL. p. 294, and Morgan, C. Ll., _ibid._\r\nvol. XLVI. p. 241. Much of the matter contained in these papers is\r\ncontroversial, and need not be fully read by those who merely wish to\r\nobtain a general account of the rocks of the district.]\r\n\r\nIn Caernarvonshire two ridges are found, the one running from Bangor\r\nto Caernarvon, and the other through Llanberis lake. The rocks of\r\nthese are generally similar to those of St Davids, and as the lowest\r\nCambrian rocks of the area closely resemble those of St Davids, the\r\nPrecambrian age of the rocks of these ridges is rendered highly\r\nprobable, though until the discovery of the _Olenellus_-fauna in the\r\narea, it cannot be regarded as proved[57].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: These rocks are described by T. M^{c}K. Hughes, _Quart.\r\nJourn. Geol. Soc._, vol. XXXIV. p. 137, and XXXV. p. 682; by Prof. T.\r\nG. Bonney, _ibid._ vol. XXXIV. p. 144; and by Dr Hicks, _ibid._ vol.\r\nXXXV. p. 295.]\r\n\r\nThe actual position of the similar rocks of Anglesey has not been so\r\nclearly fixed, as the rocks associated with them are of Ordovician\r\nage, but their resemblance to the rocks of the adjoining regions\r\nrenders their Precambrian age highly probable. It is interesting to\r\nfind in association with the rocks which resemble those of\r\nCaernarvonshire, others which Sir A. Geikie recognises as quite\r\nsimilar to some existing amongst the crystalline schists of the\r\nnorth-west Highlands of Scotland, and when these ancient rocks of\r\nAnglesey have been mapped in detail, they will probably be found to\r\npresent greater variety than is afforded by any Precambrian rocks of\r\nGreat Britain occurring S. of the Scotch border[58].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Papers upon the old rocks of Anglesey will be found in\r\nmany volumes of the _Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society_; see\r\nespecially Hicks, vol. XXXV. p. 295, Callaway, vol.

They are largely of pyroclastic origin, and from their\r\nlikeness to similar rocks of proved Precambrian age, they are very\r\nprobably of this age, as suggested by Messrs Hill and Bonney[59]. A\r\ngroup of crystalline schists is found in the south of Cornwall,\r\nespecially near the Lizard, and similar rocks are found in the Channel\r\nIsles. As their relationship to newer rocks is not clear, little can\r\nbe said about them, which has not already been noticed in mentioning\r\nthe crystalline schists of other regions[60].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Hill and Bonney, _Quart.

Geikie, Presidential Address to the\r\nGeological Society, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. XLVII. p. 63.]\r\n\r\nThe Precambrian rocks of the European continent consist largely of\r\ncrystalline schists which in their general aspects recall those of the\r\nnorth-west Highlands of Scotland. Important masses are found in\r\nBavaria, Bohemia, France, Spain, Scandinavia and Russia. The\r\nScandinavian and Russian rocks of Archæan type are in places succeeded\r\nby the _Olenellus_-bearing beds of the Cambrian rocks, and rocks of\r\nEparchæan character are not extensively developed, though certain\r\nNorwegian rocks may be the equivalents of the Torridonian rocks of\r\nScotland, and other rocks of this type are found in places in Sweden.\r\nIn Bohemia and in Brittany Precambrian strata of Eparchæan type have\r\nbeen discovered, and this type probably occurs elsewhere in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe North American rocks require some notice, for it was in Canada\r\nthat the existence of Precambrian rocks was first recognised, and the\r\nterm Laurentian, originally applied to an Archæan type of Precambrian\r\nrocks in Canada, was subsequently adopted in speaking of many\r\nPrecambrian rocks elsewhere, though it is now wisely restricted to the\r\ntype of rock in the original area to which the name was first given.\r\nThese Laurentian rocks acquired a special, interest on account of the\r\noccurrence in their limestones of a supposed reef-building\r\nforaminifer, _Eozoon canadense_, but detailed study of its structure\r\nand mode of occurrence has convinced most geologists that the\r\nstructure is inorganic.\r\n\r\nThe Laurentian rocks of the typical Laurentide region are largely\r\ncrystalline schists associated with massive crystalline rocks. The\r\nattempt to separate them chronologically into a Lower and Upper\r\ndivision was premature, as shewn by the fact that many of them, upon\r\ndetailed study, prove to be intrusive igneous rocks. In the\r\nneighbourhood of Lake Huron, a set of sedimentary rocks overlying the\r\nArchæan rocks is of Eparchæan type, consisting to a great extent of\r\nvolcanic rocks, clay-slates and schists with intrusive igneous rocks;\r\nit has been termed the Huronian System, and this term has also been\r\nextensively applied to other Eparchæan types found elsewhere, but\r\nshould be restricted to the rocks of the Huron district. A number of\r\nother rocks of Eparchæan type have been discovered in various parts of\r\nNorth America, and have been grouped together under the title of\r\nAlgonkian, a name proposed for them by Dr C. D. Walcott, and an\r\nattempt has been made to arrange them in chronological order, though\r\nin the absence of fossils, the rocks of different districts can only\r\nbe so arranged by reference to lithological characters; nevertheless a\r\ndetailed study of the Eparchæan and some of the more finely\r\ncrystalline schistose rocks points to the existence of a number of\r\ndivisions of sedimentary rocks of Precambrian age, some of which may\r\nattain to the dignity of forming separate systems[61]. By far the most\r\ninstructive development of American Precambrian rocks has been found\r\nin the Rainy Lake region of Canada, and it is the subject of a special\r\nmemoir by Dr A. C. Lawson[62]. The Archæan rocks of the region are\r\ndivided into a lower Laurentian and an upper division, which is\r\nfurther subdivided into the Coutchiching series below and the Keewatin\r\nseries above, though the rocks of the Keewatin series are largely of\r\nEparchæan character. The Laurentian rocks of this region resemble\r\nthose of the Laurentide area, and consist of highly crystalline\r\nschistose and gneissose rocks associated with compact rocks. The\r\nCoutchiching series consists of mica schists and grey laminated\r\ngneisses, which appear to have been of sedimentary origin, altered by\r\nsubsequent metamorphic action, while the Keewatin series, which\r\nreposes sometimes upon the rocks of the Coutchiching series (when the\r\njunction is an unconformable one), sometimes upon the Laurentian\r\nrocks, is formed of pyroclastic rocks and lava flows with intercalated\r\nsedimentary rocks; some of the Keewatin rocks are highly metamorphosed\r\nbut others have undergone little or no metamorphic change. The most\r\nimportant point in connexion with these rocks of the Rainy Lake Region\r\nhas reference to the relationship between the Laurentian rocks and\r\nthose of the Coutchiching and Keewatin series. Lawson demonstrates the\r\nigneous nature of the Laurentian rocks, and brings forward evidence of\r\nvarious kinds that they were formed \"by the fusion of the basement or\r\nfloor upon which the formations of the upper division of the Archæan\r\nwere originally deposited. With the fusion of this floor it seems\r\nprobable that portions of the superincumbent strata, which once formed\r\nintegral parts of either the Coutchiching series or the Keewatin, have\r\nalso been absorbed into the general magma, and reappeared on\r\ncrystallization as Laurentian gneiss. This fusion, however, only\r\nextended up to a certain uneven surface, which surface constitutes the\r\ndemarcation between the present upper and lower Archæan. Above this\r\nsurface, or upper limit of fusion, the formation of the Coutchiching\r\nand Keewatin series retained their stratiform or bedded disposition,\r\nand rested as a crust of hard and brittle rocks upon the magma,\r\nsubject to its metamorphosing influences[63].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: A large number of classifications have been proposed for\r\nthe Archæan rocks of America; the most plausible one is given in Sir\r\nA. Geikie's _Text Book of Geology_, Third Edition, p. 716.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Lawson, A. C., _Report on the Geology of the Rainy Lake\r\nRegion_. Montreal, 1888.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Lawson, _op. cit._ p. 139.]\r\n\r\nWe may now pass briefly in review the evidence which has been so far\r\nobtained as to the mode of formation of the various Precambrian rocks.\r\nThe existence of a very varied fauna amongst the earliest Cambrian\r\nstrata has been commented upon by many geologists, and according to\r\naccepted explanations of the origin of that fauna, an enormous period\r\nof time elapsed before the deposition of the earliest Cambrian strata.\r\nDuring portions of that long period, the undoubtedly clastic rocks of\r\nEparchæan type were deposited, and probably many others which are now\r\nso altered by metamorphism, like some of the Coutchiching rocks of\r\nCanada, that their original clastic origin can only be inferred and\r\nnot directly proved. Volcanic activity was very rife during the\r\ndeposition of some of these Eparchæan rocks, though perhaps not more\r\nso than during the formation of some of the Lower Palæozoic Rocks. All\r\nattempts to prove the occurrence of organisms in Precambrian strata\r\nhave hitherto failed, for no undoubted fossil has been described which\r\nis unhesitatingly accepted as of Precambrian age, notwithstanding the\r\nmany asserted occurrences of such fossils. That fossils will\r\neventually be discovered is more than probable, and their\r\nnon-detection at the present time is in no way very surprising, when\r\nwe remember the long time that elapsed after the existence of\r\nstratified rocks below the Upper Palæozoic rocks had been recognised,\r\nbefore definite faunas were discovered in them. The determination of\r\nthe Precambrian age of stratified rocks is recent, and now that this\r\ndetermination has been made, the search for fossils will be more\r\neager, and is likely to be rewarded by their discovery. Furthermore,\r\nexperience shows that when fossils are discovered in rocks of unknown\r\nage, there is a tendency to refer those rocks to some known period,\r\nand consequently we may actually possess Precambrian fossils, out of\r\nbeds which have been erroneously referred to the Cambrian or a later\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAnother important question is that of the metamorphism of a large\r\nnumber of Precambrian rocks, and here again recent research tends to\r\nshow that the metamorphism is not of a kind different from that which\r\noccurred after the end of Precambrian times; the discovery of\r\ncrystalline schists in Norway, Kirkcudbrightshire and Westmorland\r\namongst Lower Palæozoic rocks, which resemble those of Archæan masses\r\nin all respects except in the extent of area which they cover, shows\r\nthat similar processes to those which occurred in Precambrian times\r\nwent on during later periods, though perhaps not on so large a scale.\r\nThe great extent of these metamorphic rocks of Precambrian age can\r\nhardly be due in any great degree to the longer time during which they\r\nhave been subjected to metamorphic influence, for there is evidence\r\nthat much of the change took place in Precambrian times, far more than\r\nhas occurred since, and it is a significant fact that these old rocks\r\nare more extensively penetrated by intrusive igneous masses than those\r\nof later periods; here again we find that much of the intrusion\r\nactually occurred in Precambrian times. The greater extent of\r\nintrusion and metamorphism amongst these Precambrian rocks than\r\namongst later sediments indicates some differences of conditions in\r\nthe case of Precambrian and later times. If besides intrusion, actual\r\nfusion of floors of Precambrian rocks occurred, we may well suppose\r\nthat the earlier records of the rocks are for ever lost to us, the\r\nearliest sediments having been fused, but that the history of life\r\nupon our earth is to be revealed to us first in so late a stage as\r\nthat of Cambrian times is highly improbable, and we may look forward\r\nwith confidence to laying bare the records of the rocks composing the\r\ngeological column some way below the Cambrian portion of the column.\r\n\r\nUpon this foundation of igneous rock, sediment and volcanic material,\r\nformed in Precambrian times, whose history we have only begun to\r\nstudy, was laid down the great mass of sediment which the geologist\r\nhas more completely studied, where abundant traces of life are\r\npreserved, and concerning whose history we can gain a greater insight\r\nthan is permitted us in the case of the old Foundation Stones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nCYCLES OF CHANGE IN THE BRITISH AREA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore studying in further detail the strata of the geological column,\r\nit will be convenient to deal with the great physical changes which\r\nhave occurred in the British area from Precambrian times to the\r\npresent day, as this will clear the way for a right appreciation of\r\nthe main variations in the characters and distribution of the strata.\r\n\r\nAt the end of Precambrian times there was a general upheaval of the\r\nBritish area, and this we may speak of as the First Continental\r\nPeriod. It was followed by depression and extensive sedimentation,\r\nproceeding more or less continuously though with local interruptions\r\nthrough Lower Palæozoic times, so that so far as Britain is concerned\r\nwe may speak of Lower Palæozoic times as constituting the First Marine\r\nPeriod. Extensive upheaval gave rise to continental tracts and\r\nmountain chains, and deposits of abnormal character (as compared with\r\nordinary marine deposits) at the end of Lower Palæozoic times;--the\r\nDevonian period was one of elevation and denudation, and we may\r\ntherefore refer to it as the Second Continental Period. This was\r\nfollowed by depression and sedimentation in Carboniferous times, and\r\nthese Carboniferous times constitute the Second Marine Period.\r\nElevation gave rise to continental tracts and mountain chains at the\r\nend of Carboniferous times, and here again we find proofs of extensive\r\ndenudation and the formation of abnormal deposits:--the Permo-Triassic\r\nperiod is the Third Continental Period. Depression set in during early\r\nJurassic times and continued throughout the Mesozoic and the early\r\npart of Tertiary times, which form the Third Marine Period.\r\nDisturbances culminating in Miocene times once more produced\r\nterrestrial conditions. In this, the Fourth Continental Period, we are\r\nstill living.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been previously written it will be seen that each of the\r\nmarine periods should be marked by an early and late shallow-water\r\nphase, separated by an intervening marine phase, and the importance of\r\nthe phases will depend upon the length of time during which they\r\nexisted, and will differ markedly in different cases, whilst the\r\ndistinctness of the middle phase from the upper and lower, will depend\r\nupon the magnitude of the maximum submergence.\r\n\r\nDuring the first marine period submergence was comparatively rapid,\r\nand the shallow-water phase only lasted through very early Cambrian\r\ntimes in most regions, whilst the deep-water phase, complicated by\r\nmany minor upheavals, extended through the main part of Cambrian,\r\nOrdovician and Silurian times, and was replaced by the later\r\nshallow-water phase at the end of Silurian times.\r\n\r\nThe second marine period again was ushered in by rapid submergence, so\r\nthat the shallow-water phase was brief, and the main mass of the Lower\r\nCarboniferous strata was deposited in deep water; but, unlike the\r\nfirst marine period, the second was characterised by the occurrence of\r\na long interval of time marking the later shallow-water phase, during\r\nwhich the whole of the Upper Carboniferous strata were deposited. The\r\nCarboniferous Marine Period is the simplest of the three with which we\r\nhave to deal, as the local oscillations occurring on a fairly large\r\nscale for such movements were less frequent than was the case during\r\nthe first and third marine periods.\r\n\r\nThe third marine period had a long shallow-water phase at the\r\ncommencement, with many minor oscillations, causing great variation in\r\nthe character of the deposits and frequent minor unconformities. This\r\nshallow-water phase existed throughout Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous\r\ntimes. The deep-water phase existed during the deposition of the Upper\r\nCretaceous deposits, and was succeeded by the second shallow-water\r\nphase, when the early Tertiary strata were accumulated.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the elevations which accompanied the\r\nContinental Periods and those which have been alluded to as minor\r\nelevations is no doubt one of degree, but in considering the British\r\nstrata only no confusion is likely to arise on this account, as the\r\ndifference was here very great.\r\n\r\nThe events which occurred during the continental periods are of\r\nextreme importance to the geologist. Every great upheaval was\r\naccompanied by crumpling and stiffening of portions of the earth's\r\ncrust, and a definite trend was given to the strata as the result of\r\nthese movements. It is to the earth-movements of the four great\r\ncontinental periods that the present structure of the British Isles is\r\nlargely due, and in any attempt to restore the physical history of our\r\nislands considerable attention must be paid to the changes which were\r\nproduced in the stratified rocks during these periods of\r\nearth-movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE CAMBRIAN SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification._ The rocks of the Cambrian system when found reposing\r\non Precambrian rocks in Britain are always separated from the latter\r\nby an unconformity. The typical development of the rocks of the\r\nsystem, as the name implies, is in the hilly region of Caernarvonshire\r\nand Merionethshire in North Wales, and they are also well represented\r\nin South Wales, the border counties between England and Wales, and the\r\nNorth-West Highlands of Scotland. Two distinct classifications of the\r\nCambrian rocks of Britain are in use, the original one founded on\r\nvariations of lithological character, whilst the second depends upon\r\nfaunistic differences, but the original lithological classification\r\nhas been to some extent modified to make it locally correspond with\r\nthe classification based upon palæontological grounds. The following\r\ntable will shew the differences:--\r\n\r\n  Lithological Classification.          Palæontological Classification.\r\n\r\n  Tremadoc Slate Series[64]              Beds with Intermediate Fauna\r\n\r\n  Lingula Flags Series                  Beds with _Olenus_ Fauna\r\n\r\n  Menevian beds (formerly included   }\r\n     in Lingula Flags)               }  Beds with _Paradoxides_ Fauna\r\n               } Formerly grouped    }\r\n  Solva beds   } together as Harlech\r\n  Caerfai beds } or Llanberis beds      Beds with _Olenellus_ Fauna\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: In accordance with the custom usually observed in\r\nBritain, the Tremadoc slates are placed in the Cambrian system; most\r\ncontinental geologists place them in the succeeding Ordovician system.\r\nThe matter is not an important one, as the fauna is an intermediate\r\none between that of the Lingula Flags and that of the Arenig series of\r\nthe Ordovician system, and the beds are true beds of passage. As the\r\nlithological classification is essentially British, it will be as well\r\nto retain the Tremadoc Slates in the Cambrian system.]\r\n\r\nThe original lithological classification was essentially the result of\r\nProf. Sedgwick's work in North Wales, while the classification\r\naccording to faunas is the outcome of the researches of Dr Hicks in\r\nSouth Wales.\r\n\r\n_Description of the Strata._ The Cambrian rocks of North Wales occur\r\nin two complex anticlines, separated by an intermediate syncline of\r\nOrdovician strata occupying the Snowdonian hills. The southerly or\r\nHarlech anticline forms a part of Merionethshire to the east of\r\nHarlech, whilst the northern one is developed around Bangor and\r\nLlanberis. The South Welsh Cambrian rocks are chiefly found on either\r\nside of the Pembrokeshire axis of Precambrian rocks which runs through\r\nSt David's. As the corresponding rocks of the two regions were\r\ndeposited in bathymetrical zones of much the same depth, it will be\r\nconvenient to give a general account of the rocks of the two regions\r\nat the same time, leaving the student to acquire information of the\r\ndetailed variations in the larger text-books and in special\r\nmemoirs[65].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: A general account of the Cambrian, Ordovician and\r\nSilurian rocks will be found in the Sedgwick Essay for 1883, _A\r\nClassification of the Cambrian and Silurian Rocks_, though the use of\r\na cumbrous nomenclature therein will tend to confuse the reader. For a\r\ndetailed account of the Cambrian rocks of North Wales the reader is\r\nreferred to the Geological Survey Memoir, _The Geology of North\r\nWales_, by Sir A. Ramsay (2nd edition), he may also consult Belt, T.,\r\n\"On the Lingula Flags or Festiniog Group of the Dolgelly district,\"\r\n_Geol. Mag._, Dec I. vol. IV. pp. 493, 536, vol. V. p. 5. The geology\r\nof the Cambrian rocks is described in a series of Memoirs in the\r\n_Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society_ by Dr H. Hicks; the\r\nfollowing should be consulted: Harkness, R. and Hicks, H., \"On the\r\nAncient Rocks of the St David's Promontory, South Wales, and their\r\nFossil Contents,\" vol.

Mag._ Dec IV. vol.\r\nI. pp. 368, 399 and 441.]\r\n\r\nThe strata of the Caerfai and Solva groups show the prevalence of the\r\nshallow-water phase almost uninterruptedly through the whole of the\r\ntime occupied by their accumulation in the Welsh areas. They consist\r\nchiefly of basal conglomerates, succeeded by alternations of grits and\r\nshales, though the latter are often converted into slates, owing to\r\nthe subsequent production of cleavage. The basal conglomerates of the\r\nCaerfai beds are frequently marked by the existence of enormous\r\npebbles, composed of fragments of the rocks of the underlying\r\nPrecambrian groups, and the possibility of the occurrence of glacial\r\naction during their accumulation as advocated by Dr Hicks must be\r\ntaken into account. Above these beds are various coloured grits, with\r\nalternations of muddy sediments often coloured red[66]. The Solva\r\ngroup consists of massive grits, of various colours, also with\r\nalternations of mud, which have prevalent purple and green hues. The\r\ngreat thickness of the strata of the Caerfai and Solva Series, which\r\nsometimes exceeds 10,000 feet, must also be noted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: In giving this description the red (Glyn) slates of\r\nNorth Wales are treated as belonging to the Caerfai series, though\r\nthis correlation depends on lithological characters only at present.]\r\n\r\nThe Menevian beds consist essentially of very fine, well laminated\r\nblack and grey muds, which are of a texture favourable for the\r\nproduction of a somewhat regular jointing, causing the rock to break\r\ninto small rectangular blocks. They are thin, not exceeding 600 feet\r\nin thickness, and indicate the incoming of the general deep-water\r\nphase of the Lower Palæozoic epoch. The Lingula Flags mark a local\r\nreturn to shallower water conditions, especially in the central\r\nportion. The total thickness is over 3,000 feet, of which the lower\r\nstage (locally the Maentwrog series) is over 500 feet, and consists of\r\nblackish muds, the middle (Festiniog stage[67]) is about 2,000 feet\r\nthick, and is composed chiefly of shallower water gritty flags, whilst\r\nthe upper (Dolgelly) stage is of about the same thickness as the lower\r\nstage and has similar lithological characters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: The term Festiniog has been used for the whole Lingula\r\nFlag series as well as for the middle stage. It will be well to use it\r\nwith reference to the stage only.]\r\n\r\nThe Tremadoc Slates are about 1,000 feet thick. They are divided into\r\na lower and upper stage, of about equal thickness, and are essentially\r\ncomposed of iron-stained slates, with a considerable admixture of\r\ncalcareous matter in some parts of South Wales, when they furnish the\r\nnearest approach to a limestone which has been found amongst the Welsh\r\nCambrian strata. They were probably formed in a fairly deep sea.\r\n\r\nMuch pyroclastic rock and some lava flows are intercalated amongst the\r\nWelsh Cambrian sediments. Tuffs are formed in the lower beds of St\r\nDavid's, and lavas and ashes have been found amongst the Lingula Flags\r\nand Tremadoc Slates of North Wales, while the Lingula Flags of South\r\nWales have furnished several bands of ash to the north of\r\nHaverfordwest. Much of the material of the grits and muds may be\r\nderived from volcanic rocks, though how far this is so cannot be\r\nstated in the absence of information obtained by detailed petrological\r\nexamination of the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe various isolated outcrops of Cambrian strata amongst the counties\r\nof the Welsh borders and adjoining Midland counties indicate a great\r\nthinning of the Cambrian rocks in this direction.\r\n\r\nThe probable equivalents of the Caerfai rocks occur at Nuneaton,\r\nComley, and on the flanks of the Wrekin and Malvern hills. The thin\r\nbasal conglomerates are succeeded by quartzites, and sometimes red\r\ncalcareous sandstones (Comley sandstone). These rocks are succeeded by\r\nthin arenaceous and calcareous beds which represent either the Solva\r\nor Menevian beds of Wales. The Lingula Flags are represented by the\r\nMalvern Shales of the Malvern area and the Stockingford Shales of\r\nNuneaton, whilst the Tremadoc Slates have as their equivalents the\r\nShineton Shales. The exact thicknesses of these deposits do not seem\r\nto have been recorded, but Prof. Lapworth observes that in central\r\nShropshire \"the Comley and Shineton groups which ... have a collective\r\nthickness of perhaps less than 3,000 feet, we have apparently a\r\ncondensed epitome of the entire Cambrian system as at present\r\ngenerally defined.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cambrian rocks of the North-west Highlands consist of a thin\r\nconglomerate succeeded by grits and flags with shaley beds, and above\r\nthese a mass of limestone, which may represent some of the Ordovician\r\ndeposits as well as those of Cambrian age. Pending a complete\r\ndescription of the faunas of these rocks, it is sufficient to state\r\nthat the only fauna which has hitherto been described in detail\r\nindicates the existence of Lowest Cambrian rocks. Further remarks will\r\nbe made on this head when describing the character of the Cambrian\r\nfaunas. The Cambrian rocks of the North-west Highlands are also very\r\nthin as compared with those of Wales, so that the Highland and Welsh\r\nborderland regions appear to have existed as a deeper sea area than\r\nthat which is indicated by the Cambrian rocks of Wales, an inference\r\nwhich is to some extent borne out by study of the Cambrian rocks of\r\nextra-British areas, to which we may now turn.\r\n\r\nThe principal European developments of Cambrian rock are found in\r\nScandinavia, Russia, Bohemia and Spain, and of these the Scandinavian\r\none is by far the most fully developed, as there is a complete\r\nsequence in the rocks of that peninsula. They occur both in Norway and\r\nSweden, but the Swedish exposures are the most interesting in most\r\nrespects, especially those of Westrogothia and Scania. The rocks are\r\nof no great thickness, and consist essentially of black carbonaceous\r\nshales, with inconstant bands of impure black limestone composed\r\nalmost entirely of the remains of trilobites or more rarely of\r\nbrachiopods. These Alum Shales, as they are termed, rest unconformably\r\nupon Precambrian rocks, and have arenaceous and conglomeratic deposits\r\nat the base. In Russia the rocks are still further attenuated, and\r\nhave not yielded the relics of so many faunas as have been found in\r\nthe Scandinavian Cambrian rocks.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian development is incomplete, owing apparently to an\r\nunconformity at the base of the overlying Ordovician rocks, while the\r\nSpanish deposits which seem fairly thick and composed largely of\r\nmechanical sediments have not been worked out in very great detail.\r\n\r\nThe American development of Cambrian rocks resembles the European one\r\nin many striking particulars, and as in the case of Europe, there are\r\nlateral variations in the lithological characters of the rocks, though\r\nin the opposite direction, the shallow-water deposits occurring on the\r\neast coast, and the deep-water deposits further west.\r\n\r\nThe general distribution of the different types of Cambrian strata in\r\nEurope and North America has been accounted for on the supposition\r\nthat in Cambrian times a tract of land lay over much of the present\r\nsite of the North Atlantic Ocean, and that the detritus of that land\r\nformed the shallow-water accumulations of Wales and the east of\r\nCanada, whilst further away from it were deposited the open-sea\r\naccumulations of Scandinavia and Russia on one side and of the more\r\nwesterly regions of North America on the other, as indicated in Fig.\r\n16.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.\r\n\r\n  P.

Dr C. D. Walcott records representatives of Spongiae, Hydrozoa,\r\nEchinodermata, Annelida, Brachiopoda, Lamellibranchiata, Gastropoda,\r\nPteropoda, Crustacea and Trilobita as occurring in the _Olenellus_\r\nbeds of North America and other groups are represented in the rocks of\r\nthis age in the Old World. The Cambrian trilobites as a whole are of\r\nmore generalised types than those of the later systems which furnish\r\ntheir remains, as indicated especially by the looseness of the body,\r\nand the large number of body rings in many of the genera, while the\r\ntail or pygidium was small and formed of only a few coalesced\r\nsegments, as pointed out by Barrande. In the later trilobites the test\r\nis more compact, there are on the whole fewer body rings, as more of\r\nthese have become fused into a tail which is therefore larger than\r\nthat of the average tail of the Cambrian trilobite.\r\n\r\nTaking the faunas in order, the oldest or _Olenellus_ fauna has\r\nfurnished a great variety of forms in the North-west Highlands of\r\nScotland, Shropshire, Scandinavia, Esthonia, Sardinia, Canada, and\r\nNewfoundland, whilst representative species of the fauna have been\r\nrecorded also from Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Pembrokeshire, India,\r\nChina, and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe dominant form is the trilobite of the genus or group _Olenellus_,\r\nwhich contains a great variety of species referable to three or four\r\ndivisions which have been ranked as separate genera by some writers.\r\nAssociated with _Olenellus_ are trilobites belonging to other genera,\r\nwhich are found in higher deposits, though there represented by\r\ndifferent species.\r\n\r\nBrachiopods are fairly abundant, especially those provided with a\r\nhorny shell; of these, the genus _Kutorgina_ is widely distributed.\r\n\r\nThe zoological relationships of several of the fossils of this horizon\r\nare as yet doubtful. The Archæocyathinæ show affinities with certain\r\ncorals; a number of tests, included in the genus _Hyolithes_ and its\r\nallies are doubtfully referred to the Pteropods, and the position of\r\nthe genus _Volborthella_ is uncertain. Special attention is directed\r\nto these doubtful relationships, as it is possible that a number of\r\n'generalised forms' of organisms occur in these strata[68].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: For an account of the _Olenellus_ fauna see Walcott, C.\r\nD., \"The Fauna of the Lower Cambrian or Olenellus Zone,\" _Tenth Annual\r\nReport of the Director of the United States Geological Survey_,\r\nWashington, 1890. It is possible that some of the fossils mentioned in\r\nthat report belong to strata above that containing _Olenellus_.]\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed here that faunas have been discovered which are\r\npossibly of earlier date than the _Olenellus_ fauna, as they do not\r\ncorrespond with it, or with those of newer strata. One, the _Neobolus_\r\nfauna of the Salt Range of India, occurs in beds below those with\r\n_Olenellus_, though it is not yet clear that _Olenellus_ will not be\r\neventually discovered associated with it, whilst the other, the\r\n_Protolenus_ fauna of Canada, is of unknown age[69].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: For an account of the _Neobolus_ beds see Noetling, F.,\r\n\"On the Cambrian Formation of the Eastern Salt Range,\" _Records Geol.\r\nSurvey, India_, vol. XXVII. p. 71, and for the Protolenus fauna\r\nconsult a paper by Matthew, G. F., \"The _Protolenus_ Fauna,\" _Trans.\r\nNew York Acad. of Science_, 1895, vol. XIV. p. 101.]\r\n\r\nThe _Olenellus_ beds are succeeded by beds containing the\r\n_Paradoxides_ fauna, which have been found in North and South Wales,\r\nShropshire, Scandinavia, Bohemia, Spain, and North and South America.\r\n_Olenellus_ and its allies became extinct (or else so scarce that no\r\nrelics of them have been discovered in the _Paradoxides_ beds) before\r\nthe commencement of the deposition of the strata containing the\r\n_Paradoxides_ fauna, and few genera pass from the beds with the one\r\nfauna to that containing the other. The _Paradoxides_ fauna existed\r\nfor a considerable period, and the beds have been divided into a\r\nseries of zones characterised by different species of _Paradoxides_,\r\nthus\r\n\r\nDr Hicks records the following zones in Pembrokeshire[70]:--\r\n\r\n  Zone of _Paradoxides_  _Davidis_   }  Menevian.\r\n    \"             \"      _Hicksii_   }\r\n\r\n    \"             \"      _Aurora_    }\r\n    \"             \"      _Solvensis_ }  Solva.\r\n    \"             \"      _Harknessi_ }\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: The order here as elsewhere is _ascending_, i.e. the\r\nnewest deposit is placed at the top.]\r\n\r\nDr Tullberg divides the _Paradoxides_ beds of Scania into thirteen\r\nzones, though only a few of these are characterised by definite\r\nspecies of _Paradoxides_. The _Olenellus_ beds have not yet been\r\ndivided into zones, though this will probably be the outcome of\r\nfurther study[71].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: The _Paradoxides_ fauna is described in the following\r\nworks: Britain, Hicks, H. and Salter J. W., _Quart. Journ. Geol.\r\nSoc._, vol. XXIV. p. 510, XXV. p. 51, XXVII. p. 173, and Hicks, H. and\r\nHarkness, R., _ibid._ vol. XXVII. p. 384; Scandinavia, Angelin, N.

Canada_, 1882\r\nand succeeding years.]\r\n\r\nThe strata with _Paradoxides_ are succeeded by those with the _Olenus_\r\nfauna, characterised by the genus _Olenus_ and a large number of\r\nallied genera or sub-genera as some prefer to term them. The genus\r\n_Olenus_ (_sensu stricto_) is very abundant in the lower part of the\r\nseries, whilst the allied forms are more abundant in the upper beds.\r\nThe genus _Paradoxides_ and its associates disappeared before the\r\ndeposition of these strata containing _Olenus_ and its allies, and\r\nindeed the complete change in the character of the faunas in Europe is\r\nvery remarkable. The _Olenus_ fauna has been found in North Wales,\r\nPembrokeshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, and abroad in Scandinavia\r\nand Canada. It is interesting to note among the fossils of the\r\n_Olenus_ beds the occurrence of a graptolite which is associated with\r\n_Olenus_ in Scandinavia; this is the earliest recorded appearance of a\r\ngroup which is destined to play so important a role amongst the\r\nfossils of the succeeding system[72]. The following zones have been\r\ndetected by Dr S. A. Tullberg amongst the _Olenus_ beds of Scania:--\r\n\r\n  Zone of _Acerocare ecorne_.\r\n     \"    _Dictyograptus flabelliformis_.\r\n     \"    _Cyclognathus micropygus_.\r\n     \"    _Peltura scarabæoides_.\r\n     \"    _Eurycare camuricorne_.\r\n     \"    _Parabolina spinulosa_.\r\n     \"    _Ceratopyge_ sp.\r\n     \"    _Olenus_ (proper).\r\n     \"    _Leperditia_.\r\n     \"    _Agnostus pisiformis_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: For descriptions of the _Olenus_ fauna consult the\r\nfollowing:--Wales, Belt, T., _Geol.

Soc.\r\nCanada_, 1891.]\r\n\r\nThe beds with _Dictyograptus flabelliformis_ form a wonderfully\r\nconstant horizon at or near the top of the _Olenus_ beds. They are\r\nfound in North Wales, the Border Counties between Wales and England,\r\nFrance, Scandinavia, Russia and Canada.\r\n\r\nThe passage fauna of the beds which are the equivalents of the\r\nTremadoc Slates may be spoken of as the _Ceratopyge_ fauna, for\r\n_Ceratopyge forficula_, a remarkable species of trilobite,\r\ncharacterises it in Scandinavia, and will probably be found\r\nelsewhere. _Ceratopyge_ beds have been found in North and South Wales,\r\nShropshire, Scandinavia, Bavaria and North America, and in each case\r\nthe fauna is intermediate in character between that of the Cambrian\r\nand that of the Ordovician system, containing the loosely-formed\r\ntrilobites of the former with the more compact ones of the latter. The\r\ngenus _Bryograptus_, a many-branched graptolite, also appears to\r\ncharacterise this fauna[73].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: For accounts of the Tremadoc Slates Fauna in England and\r\nWales see Ramsay, A. C., _Geology of North Wales_, Appendix; Hicks,\r\nH., _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. XXIX. p. 39; Callaway, C.,\r\n_ibid._ vol. XXXIII. p. 652, whilst many of the foreign fossils are\r\nnoticed in Brögger's _Die Silurischen Etagen 2 und 3_ and Barrande's\r\n_Faune silurienne des Environs de Hof en Bavière_.]\r\n\r\nThe faunas of the Cambrian rocks have not been studied in sufficient\r\ndetail, with reference to the physical surroundings of the organisms,\r\nto throw much light upon the conditions under which the strata were\r\ndeposited, though the evidence obtained from an examination of the\r\nlithological characters of the deposits is generally corroborated by\r\nstudy of the organic contents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDOVICIAN SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification._ The Ordovician strata were originally divided into\r\nseries by Sedgwick as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Upper Bala,\r\n  Middle Bala,\r\n  Lower Bala,\r\n  Arenig.\r\n\r\nThe Arenig series was at one time included by some writers with the\r\nLower Bala under the name Llandeilo, but the word Llandeilo is now\r\nused in the sense of Sedgwick's Lower Bala. The Middle Bala is often\r\nspoken of as Caradoc, but the terms Bala and Caradoc are sometimes\r\nused interchangeably. As much confusion attaches to the use of the\r\nname Bala without explanation, the alternative titles have been\r\nlargely adopted, and as the series are well defined there is no\r\nobjection to their use, save that some expression is wanted equivalent\r\nto Upper Bala. The local term Ashgill shales was originally applied by\r\nMr W. Talbot Aveline to beds of this age in Lakeland, and I have\r\nelsewhere suggested the use of this name for the whole series in that\r\nregion; its use may well be extended to the series which is developed\r\nin many parts of Britain and the continent. The terms which will be\r\nused here, therefore, for the different series of the Ordovician\r\nsystem are the following:--\r\n\r\n  Ashgill Series (= Upper Bala)\r\n  Caradoc    \"   (= Middle \" )\r\n  Llandeilo  \"   (= Lower  \" )\r\n  Arenig     \"\r\n\r\nAdopting a palæontological classification, we may speak of the Arenig\r\nand Llandeilo beds as those containing the _Asaphus_ fauna, whilst the\r\nCaradoc and Ashgill beds possess the _Trinucleus_ fauna; this is the\r\nterminology employed by Angelin for the equivalent strata of Sweden.\r\nIt must be noted that here the names applied are not those of\r\nabsolutely characteristic genera, as was the case with those adopted\r\nfor naming the Cambrian faunas, for both _Asaphus_ and _Trinucleus_\r\nrange through the beds of the system; but whereas _Asaphus_ is most\r\nabundant in the beds of the two lower series, _Trinucleus_ occurs most\r\nfrequently in those of the two upper series.\r\n\r\n_Description of the strata._ The Ordovician rocks are found over large\r\ntracts in North and South Wales, in the counties on the Welsh border,\r\nin Lakeland and the outlying districts in the Southern Uplands of\r\nScotland, and in detached areas in Ireland. There are three main types\r\nof deposit:--(i) the volcanic type, in which the ordinary sediments\r\nare associated with a large amount of contemporaneous volcanic matter,\r\n(ii) the black shale type, with a fauna consisting largely of\r\ngraptolites, and (iii) the ordinary sedimentary type, in which we find\r\nalternations of grits, shales, and more or less impure limestones. We\r\nalso find developments which are intermediate between any two or even\r\nall three of these types. The first type is characteristically\r\ndeveloped in Caernarvonshire and Merionethshire, the second in the\r\nDumfriesshire Uplands, and the third in the Girvan district of\r\nAyrshire. The variation in the thickness of these three types of\r\ndeposit is shown in the accompanying sections of the Caernarvon,\r\nMerioneth, Moffat and Girvan regions (see Fig. 17).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.\r\n\r\nShowing the variations in the characters of the Ordovician deposits of\r\nthe three principal types.\r\n\r\n  Scale 1 in. = 1000 feet.\r\n\r\n  A = Arenig.  L = Llandeilo.  C = Caradoc.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the Arenig rocks of the Scotch areas is unknown.]\r\n\r\nThe North Welsh area gives two different developments of the\r\nOrdovician strata, one of which is much less volcanic than the other.\r\nIn the Merioneth-Caernarvon area, two great masses of volcanic rock\r\nform the Aran and Arenig hills of Merioneth and the Snowdonian group\r\nof Caernarvon. The former are of Arenig, the latter of Caradoc age.\r\nThe Merionethshire volcanic rocks consist of a great thickness of\r\nlavas and ashes of intermediate composition (anderites), associated\r\nwith sandy and muddy sediments of no great vertical depth. The\r\nLlandeilo beds of this area are chiefly of the nature of black shales,\r\nwhile the Caradoc series is represented by volcanic lavas and ashes of\r\nacid composition (felsites) with a few thin interbedded sediments. A\r\ncalcareous ash forming the summit of Snowdon is of importance as being\r\non the same horizon as a limestone (the Bala limestone) found in the\r\nother North Welsh area. The Ashgill series is not represented in\r\nSnowdonia.\r\n\r\nIn the other North Welsh tract, around Bala Lake, the volcanic matter\r\nis much less conspicuous. The Arenig rocks are not seen nearer than\r\nthe Arenig mountains which form the western boundary of this second\r\ntract. The Llandeilo beds consist of shaley deposits with a\r\nwell-marked limestone, the Llandeilo limestone, in the centre, whilst\r\nthe Caradoc beds consist chiefly of muddy sediments with some thin\r\nashes and a limestone, the Bala limestone, at the top. The Ashgill\r\nseries contains a basal limestone, the Rhiwlas limestone, succeeded by\r\nshales, and another thin limestone called the Hirnant limestone at the\r\nsummit.\r\n\r\nIn South Wales the Arenig beds[74] are chiefly composed of slates, and\r\nare divisible into an upper and lower group. The total thickness is\r\nabout 2000 feet. The Llandeilo beds contain three series:--\r\n\r\n  Upper Llandeilo Slates 1000\r\n  Llandeilo Limestone     200\r\n  Lower Llandeilo Slates  800.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: A remarkable fauna, fairly well represented in Britain\r\nand exceedingly well developed on the continent, exists in the\r\nUppermost Arenig and Lower Llandeilo beds, and it is well separated\r\nfrom the dominant Arenig fauna below and Llandeilo fauna above. To the\r\nbeds which contain it Dr Hicks has given the name Llanvirn series.]\r\n\r\nThe Caradoc beds consist of black graptolitic shales of no great\r\nthickness, succeeded by an impure limestone on the horizon of the Bala\r\nlimestone, while the Ashgill series like that of North Wales is\r\nseparated into upper and lower limestone stages with an intervening\r\nstage composed of shales.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of the Welsh borderland are well developed in Shropshire,\r\nwhere there is practically a repetition of the Caernarvon-Merioneth\r\ndevelopment, with variations in detail. The Arenig and Caradoc\r\nvolcanic rocks are not so thick as those of the Welsh district, but\r\nare nevertheless of considerable importance[75].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: For information concerning these beds see Lapworth, C.\r\nand Watts, W. W., \"The Geology of South Shropshire,\" _Proc. Geol.\r\nAssoc._, vol. XIII. p. 297.]\r\n\r\nIn the hilly region of Cumberland, Westmorland, and the adjoining\r\nparts of Yorkshire the succession differs from that of any of the\r\nWelsh regions, for the great period of volcanicity was during the\r\nformation of the Llandeilo rocks, and there were merely sporadic\r\noutbursts in Arenig and Caradoc times. The Arenig rocks consist of\r\nblack shales with interstratified beds of coarser sediment, and some\r\nthin lavas and ashes of intermediate type. The Llandeilo series is\r\nrepresented by a very great thickness of volcanic rocks, varying in\r\ncomposition from basic to acid lavas, with associated pyroclastic\r\nrocks. The rocks of the Caradoc period largely consist of impure\r\nlimestone with associated argillaceous rocks, and contemporaneous\r\nvolcanic rocks of acid character. A marked unconformity is found\r\nlocally in the centre of these. The Ashgill series consists of a basal\r\nlimestone with shales above, and there is evidence that volcanic\r\nactivity had not become extinct during the deposition of the rocks of\r\nthis series.\r\n\r\nPassing on to Scotland, the graptolitic type is admirably shown in the\r\nsouthern Uplands of the neighbourhood of Moffat, Dumfriesshire. The\r\nbase of the Ordovician system has not been found, but the lowest\r\nseries seems to be represented by shales with a graptolite possibly of\r\nArenig age. Above this are volcanic beds succeeded by a group of black\r\nshales known as the Moffat shales. They are only about six hundred\r\nfeet in thickness, and yet represent much of the Ordovician and part\r\nof the Silurian strata as developed elsewhere. The beds belonging to\r\nthe Ordovician system are divided into two series, the Glenkiln shales\r\nbelow and the Hartfell shales above. The former consist of intensely\r\nblack muds with few fossils save graptolites, and a deposit of chert\r\nat the base which is composed of radiolaria. The graptolites of the\r\nblack shales are Upper Llandeilo forms, but the thin deposit of\r\nradiolarian chert may represent the rest of the Llandeilo period and\r\npart of the Arenig period also. The Hartfell shales are also usually\r\nblack graptolite shales with lighter deposits nearly barren of organic\r\nremains; they represent the Caradoc and Ashgill series and pass\r\nconformably into the deposits of Silurian age[76]. The ordinary\r\nsedimentary type of Ordovician rocks is found in Ayrshire, though a\r\nfew thin graptolitic seams are intercalated with the conglomerates\r\nand shelly sands, clays and limestones of the region, which is\r\ntherefore peculiarly valuable as affording a means of comparison of\r\nthe shelly type with the graptolitic type of Ordovician deposits. The\r\nArenig series consists of black shales with graptolites, and these\r\nrocks are succeeded by a volcanic group which is probably of Llandeilo\r\nage. Above these volcanic beds, as in Dumfriesshire, we find three\r\ngreat divisions, two of which are of Ordovician, the third of Silurian\r\nage. The Ordovician divisions are respectively termed the Barr series,\r\nwhich is the equivalent of the Glenkiln shales, and the Ardmillan\r\nseries above, equivalent to the Hartfell shales[77].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: The Moffat beds are described in a paper by Prof.\r\nLapworth entitled \"The Moffat Series\" in the _Quarterly Journal of the\r\nGeological Society_, vol. XXXIV. p. 239. This paper, which is a\r\nmasterpiece of detailed work, has furnished a clue to many problems.\r\nFew students will be able to follow the numerous details, and for\r\ngeneral information concerning the beds they are recommended to read\r\nanother paper by the same author \"On the Ballantrae Rocks of South\r\nScotland,\" _Geol. Mag._ Dec. III. vol. VI. p. 20. An account of the\r\nradiolarian cherts by Dr G. J. Hinde will be found in the _Annals and\r\nMagazine of Natural History_ for July, 1890, p. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: See Lapworth, C., \"The Girvan Succession,\" _Quart.\r\nJourn. Geol. Soc._, vol. XXXVIII. p. 537, and also the paper on the\r\nBallantrae Rocks referred to in the preceding footnote. The latter\r\npaper should be carefully read by all students of the stratigraphy of\r\nthe Lower Palæozoic Rocks.]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find that in the north of Ireland the rocks\r\ngenerally coincide in characters with those which are found along the\r\nsame line of strike in Great Britain; thus, the Girvan type appears in\r\nLondonderry, Tyrone and Fermanagh, the Moffat type in County Down, and\r\nthe Lake District type in the counties of Dublin and Kildare.\r\n\r\nOn the continent the volcanic material which plays so important a part\r\nin the constitution of the Ordovician accumulations of Britain is\r\npractically absent, and the strata are largely composed of\r\naccumulations of shale and limestone with occasional coarser deposits.\r\nIn Scandinavia, the Arenig beds consist of limestones with a few\r\nshales, the Llandeilo deposits are largely calcareous, those of\r\nCaradoc age are partly calcareous and towards the top usually\r\nargillaceous, while the equivalents of the British Ashgill series are\r\ncalcareous at the base and argillaceous at the summit. In Russia the\r\ncalcareous matter preponderates over the argillaceous material.\r\n\r\nOrdovician strata are also found in Belgium, France, Bohemia, and\r\nother places, and are largely composed of mechanical sediments of\r\nvarying degrees of fineness mixed occasionally with some calcareous\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe variation in the characters of the Ordovician strata of Britain\r\npoints to accumulation in a fairly deep sea, usually at some distance\r\nfrom the land, but dotted over with volcanoes which often rose above\r\nthe water, causing the addition of much volcanic material to the\r\nordinary sediments, and the existence of minor unconformities at\r\ndifferent horizons along their flanks. As these unconformities are not\r\nalways associated with volcanic material it is obvious that uplifts\r\nmust have occurred occasionally during the deposition of the rocks;\r\none important uplift is indicated by the occurrence of an unconformity\r\nin the Arenig rocks of Wales, while another is seen amongst the\r\nCaradoc rocks of the Welsh borders. On the whole, however, the period\r\nwas one of slow subsidence, the deposition of material generally\r\nkeeping pace with this subsidence, and accordingly there is a great\r\nuniformity of characters amongst the strata over wide areas. The\r\nprobable continuation through the Ordovician period of the tract of\r\nland over the present site of the N. Atlantic ocean which as we have\r\nreason to suppose existed during Cambrian times, is indicated by\r\nsimilar changes of lithological character amongst the strata when\r\ntraced from Britain eastward to Russia in both Cambrian and Ordovician\r\ntimes, and the continuance of these conditions over the American area\r\nis also indicated by study of the variations amongst the American\r\nOrdovician deposits.\r\n\r\n_The Ordovician Faunas._ The Ordovician period has justly been termed\r\nthe Period of Graptolites, which are the dominant forms of the time,\r\nand continue in abundance throughout the period. The abundance of\r\ngraptolites in black shales associated with few other organisms has\r\noften been noted. It appears to be due to a large extent to the slow\r\naccumulation of the graptolitic deposits, allowing an abundance of\r\nthese creatures to be showered upon the ocean floor, after death, for\r\nthe evidence derived from detailed examination of their structure\r\npoints to their existence as floating organisms. The tests of other\r\ncreatures largely calcareous may well have been dissolved before\r\nreaching the sea-floor. In support of the view that these black shales\r\nare abysmal deposits may be noted the singular persistence of their\r\nlithological characters over wide areas, their replacement by much\r\ngreater thicknesses of normal sediments along the ancient coast-lines,\r\nthe frequent occurrence together of blind trilobites with those having\r\nabnormally large eyes when these creatures are associated with\r\ngraptolites in the black shales, and lastly the interstratification of\r\nthe black shales with radiolarian cherts similar to the modern abysmal\r\nradiolarian oozes. If this be so, we ought to find graptolites in\r\nmarine deposits of all kinds, and indeed they are found there, though\r\nlargely masked by the mass of sediment and the hosts of other included\r\nfossils, so that their discovery is rendered much more difficult than\r\nwhen they occur in the black shales,--a state of things which is\r\nfamiliar in the case of other pelagic organisms as _Globigerinæ_,\r\nradiolaria, and pteropods, whose tests abound in the abysmal deposits\r\nand are comparatively rare in those of terrigenous origin[78].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: The importance of the graptolites as indices of the\r\ngeological age will be seen by perusal of Prof. Lapworth's paper \"On\r\nthe Geological Distribution of the Rhabdophora,\" _Ann. and Mag. Nat.\r\nHist._, Ser. 5, vol. III. (1897).]\r\n\r\nThe characters of the Ordovician trilobites have already been noticed.\r\nThese organisms are abundant, and occur in sediments of all kinds. Of\r\nother groups, the significance of the radiolaria has been referred to\r\nabove. Corals occasionally form reef-like masses of limestone as in\r\nthe limestones of the Caradoc epoch; the echinoderms are well\r\nrepresented, cystids being locally abundant; of the crustacea, many\r\nremains of tests of phyllocarida have been recorded; the brachiopods\r\nare very abundant, and of the mollusca, lamellibranchs, gastropods and\r\ncephalopods all occur with frequency though none of these groups is\r\nvery prevalent. Certain forms have been referred to pteropods though\r\nwith doubt, and other shells seem to be referable to the heteropods.\r\nThe existence of vertebrates during Ordovician times is not, in the\r\nopinion of many geologists, proved, though remains of fishes have been\r\nrecorded from the Ordovician strata of North America; but it is\r\ndesirable that more evidence of this occurrence should be given[79].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Walcott, C. D., \"Preliminary Notes on the Discovery of a\r\nVertebrate Fauna in Silurian (Ordovician) Strata,\" _Bulletin Geol.\r\nSoc. America_, vol. III. p. 153.]\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the Ordovician faunas like that of the sediments\r\npoints to the prevalence of open ocean conditions over wide areas\r\nduring the period, with occasional approaches to land, which was often\r\nof a volcanic nature. Around this land clustered the ordinary\r\ninvertebrates, building up coral-reefs and shell-banks, whilst away in\r\nthe open oceans the graptolites floated, almost alone, and sank to the\r\nocean floor after death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE SILURIAN SYSTEM AND THE CHANGES WHICH OCCURRED IN BRITAIN AT THE\r\nCLOSE OF SILURIAN TIMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification._ The Silurian system was originally divided by its\r\nfounder, Sir R. I. Murchison, into three series, as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Ludlow Series\r\n  Wenlock    \"\r\n  Llandovery \"\r\n\r\nThe term May Hill, proposed by Sedgwick, is sometimes used as\r\nsynonymous with Llandovery. This classification omits a somewhat\r\nimportant set of beds intercalated between those of the Llandovery and\r\nWenlock series known as the Tarannon shales, and in Britain if we were\r\nto classify afresh, it would be more convenient to include some of the\r\nbeds formerly referred to the Ludlow in the Wenlock. I shall, however,\r\nadopt the old and well-established classification, adding the term\r\nTarannon to Llandovery, and speaking of the Llandovery-Tarannon\r\nseries. The nature of the two classifications is shown in the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n                             Old             New           Palæontological\r\n         Stages.

Elsewhere we find a\r\npredominance of shales passing into grits at the top of the system,\r\nthe change indicating the incoming of the shallow-water phase before\r\nthe commencement of the second continental period. Particular stress\r\nis laid upon the predominant shaley character of the beds, for, on\r\naccount of the richness and variety of the faunas of the calcareous\r\nrocks, greater attention is naturally paid to them in geological\r\nworks, and the student may get a false idea of their relative\r\nimportance. An attempt is made below (Fig. 18) to give a general idea\r\nof the variations in lithological characters of the Silurian rocks in\r\ndifferent parts of Britain.\r\n\r\nThe Silurian strata are mostly found in the same localities as those\r\nwhich furnish exposures of the rocks of Ordovician age.\r\n\r\nThe development in the typical Silurian region of the Welsh borders is\r\ncharacterised by the abundance of calcareous matter which is found\r\nthere as compared with that which exists in the other British\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nThe Llandovery strata are sandy, often conglomeratic, with a fair\r\namount of calcareous matter in places. The arenaceous nature is\r\nundoubtedly due to the proximity of land caused by local upheaval at\r\nthe end of Ordovician times, and the Upper Llandovery rocks sometimes\r\nrest unconformably on the Lower ones, at other times on Ordovician,\r\nCambrian, or even Precambrian rocks. The Tarannon shales are light\r\ngreen shales with intercalated grits. The Wenlock series consists of a\r\ngroup of shales separating a lower, very inconstant, earthy limestone\r\nfrom an upper, more constant, thicker and purer limestone. The latter,\r\nthe Wenlock limestone, is composed of fragments and perfect specimens\r\nof various fossils, and the fragmentary nature of many of the shells\r\nindicates the occurrence of wave-action and probable formation in\r\nshallow water, in some places against coral-reefs.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Ludlow beds consist of sandy shales; they are separated from\r\nthe Upper Ludlow beds by an impure limestone, the Aymestry limestone.\r\nThe Upper Ludlow beds consist mainly of grits and flags, often\r\ncoloured red towards the summit.\r\n\r\nIn North Wales the Llandovery beds occasionally present the shelly\r\narenaceous types of deposit as near Llangollen, at other times as near\r\nConway, Corwen, and in Anglesey, the graptolitic shale type. They\r\nalso rest unconformably upon the Ordovician rocks in this area. The\r\nTarannon shales resemble those of the border county. The Wenlock\r\nseries consists essentially of shales, while the Ludlow development\r\ndiffers from that of the borders in its greater thickness and the\r\nabsence of any calcareous band in the centre. In Central Wales the\r\ngraptolitic type of the Llandovery-Tarannon series is found, but the\r\ngraptolite-bearing shales of the Llandovery epoch are thin beds\r\noccurring between grits and flags no doubt deposited in shallow water,\r\nand this division of the series is of very great thickness.\r\n\r\nIn South Wales the Silurian rocks are very similar to those of the\r\nWelsh borders, save that the calcareous deposits are fewer and\r\nthinner.\r\n\r\nThe Lake District Silurian strata generally resemble those of North\r\nWales. The Llandovery-Tarannon rocks are of the graptolite-shale type,\r\nintercalated with fine grits in the case of the beds of Tarannon age.\r\nThe Wenlock beds consist of shales, and the Ludlow beds of gritty\r\nshales beneath, and massive flags and grits at the summit. These\r\nLudlow beds are here of great thickness (certainly not less than 7000\r\nfeet) and were obviously accumulated for the most part in shallow\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe Llandovery-Tarannon rocks of Southern Scotland show the two types\r\nwhich prevailed in the Moffat and Girvan areas in later Ordovician\r\ntimes. The Llandovery beds of Moffat are known as the Birkhill shales,\r\nand are very thin. The representatives of the Tarannon shales,\r\nhowever, the Gala beds, consist mainly of grits, and attain a great\r\nthickness. In the Girvan area, the Llandovery beds are of the shelly\r\ntype. Here as at Moffat and in the Lake District there is perfect\r\nconformity between the beds of Ordovician and those of Silurian age,\r\nand accordingly it is instructive to note the completeness of the\r\npalæontological break, especially in the Moffat district. The higher\r\nSilurian beds of Southern Scotland present a general resemblance to\r\nthose of North Wales and the Lake District[80].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: For descriptions of the Silurian beds of the typical\r\nregion see Lapworth and Watts, _Proc. Geol. Assoc._, vol. XIII. p.\r\n297, those of Wales are described by Lake and Groom, _Quart. Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc._, vol. XLIX. p. 426, and Lake, _ibid._ vol. LI. p. 9. A\r\ndescription of those of Lakeland will be found in the Memoir of the\r\nGeological Survey \"The Geology of the Country around Kendal, etc.\"\r\nwhile the Scotch Rocks are described in Lapworth's papers on Moffat\r\nand Girvan.]\r\n\r\nOn the European continent we find indications of conditions similar to\r\nthose which prevailed during the Ordovician period; the strata become\r\nmuch thinner and more calcareous in Scandinavia, and still thinner in\r\nthe Baltic provinces of Russia, where they consist very largely of\r\ncalcareous matter. In central Europe the greater abundance of\r\ncalcareous matter, compared with that which is found in the Ordovician\r\nstrata of that region, points to a change in physical conditions which\r\nbecame still more marked after Silurian times.\r\n\r\nIn North America, the succession is very similar to that of Britain,\r\nthe calcareous development of the Silurian rocks being found around\r\nNiagara, but towards the close of Silurian times the shallow-water\r\nphase became marked in places by the deposition of chemical\r\nprecipitates which indicate the separation of a portion of the late\r\nSilurian ocean from the main mass during the period of formation of\r\nthese abnormal deposits.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of Silurian times, until the advent of the\r\nshallow-water phase, recall those of Ordovician times and point to a\r\nwide expanse of ocean at some distance from the land, though the\r\nearliest deposits become arenaceous where they were deposited against\r\nan old land surface formed by the elevation of the Welsh Ordovician\r\nrocks, which were denuded to supply this material. One marked\r\ndifference existed between the physical conditions of our area during\r\nOrdovician and Silurian times, for the volcanic activity which was\r\nrife during Ordovician times almost ceased during Silurian times,\r\nexcept in the region now occupied by the extreme south-west of\r\nIreland, and accordingly volcanic material does not appreciably\r\ncontribute to the formation of the Silurian deposits. The shallowness\r\nof the sea-floor at times is marked by the occurrence of masses of\r\nreef-building corals in the limestones, and these probably indicate\r\nthe prevalence of a fairly warm climate, an inference supported by the\r\nnature of the Gastropod fauna of Gothland, as noticed in Chap. IX.\r\n\r\nThe shallow-water phase commences fairly simultaneously over the whole\r\narea at the beginning of the deposition of the Lower Ludlow rocks, and\r\nbecomes more marked in the Upper Ludlow rocks, being most noticeable\r\nat their extreme summit, when a change occurred which will be\r\nconsidered at the conclusion of this chapter.\r\n\r\n_The Silurian Faunas[81]._ The Silurian period has been termed the\r\nperiod of Crinoids, and this group of creatures certainly contained a\r\ngreat variety of very remarkable forms, which are specially numerous\r\nin the Wenlock Limestone of the Welsh borders, Gothland, and North\r\nAmerica, but many of the rocks of the system display few traces of\r\nthese organisms. The trilobites and graptolites still contribute\r\nlargely to the fauna, the latter becoming very scarce at the summit of\r\nthe system, though a few specimens have been detected in the rocks of\r\nthe succeeding system. The trilobites belong to few genera though\r\nthese are mostly more highly organised than those of the Ordovician\r\nperiod. The genus _Harpes_ has been taken as fairly characteristic of\r\nthe lower part of the system in Sweden, and it occurs there abundantly\r\nin places in Britain, whilst _Encrinurus_ is more abundant in the\r\nupper series, but both of these genera range from higher Ordovician\r\nbeds into the Devonian. Mention has already been made of the corals.\r\nBrachiopods are very abundant, and Mollusca appear with considerable\r\nfrequency. The appearance of true insects is of importance,\r\ncockroaches have been recorded from Silurian rocks and a number of\r\nother insects have lately been recorded from Canada[82]. Eurypterids\r\noccur in considerable abundance in the higher parts of the system, as\r\ndo also the remains of fish.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: For an account of the Silurian faunas the student may\r\nconsult Sir R. I. Murchison's _Silurian System_ or the shorter\r\n_Siluria_ and Lapworth's paper on the Geological Distribution of the\r\nRhabdophora.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: See an article by Dr G. F. Matthew, \"Description of an\r\nextinct Palæozoic Insect and a review of the Fauna with which it\r\noccurs,\" _Bulletin_ XV. _of the Natural History Society of New\r\nBrunswick_. The Silurian Rocks of the Little River Group of St John,\r\nNew Brunswick, have yielded species of land snails, two doubtful\r\nsaw-bugs, several arachnids, and myriopods, two insects of the order\r\nThysanura (Spring-tails), and eight Palæodictyoptera.]\r\n\r\nThe close of Silurian times ushered in the second continental period\r\nin Britain when a large part of our area and the adjoining areas to\r\nthe north and north-east were uplifted to form land, which in the case\r\nof our area was interpenetrated by watery tracts, whose exact nature\r\nis still a subject of dispute. Accordingly the deposits which were\r\nformed during this period are local and in some cases abnormal, but\r\nthey will be considered in the next chapter. Simultaneously with the\r\nformation of these deposits, uplift of the sea-floor converted wider\r\nand wider areas into land, and this land underwent considerable\r\ndenudation, so that the tops of the anticlines were worn away. The\r\ngeneral trend of the anticlines was east-north-east and\r\nwest-south-west, and accordingly a series of mountain chains possessed\r\nthat direction, for the epeirogenic movements were accompanied by\r\norogenic ones. Between the regions of uplifts were depressions in\r\nwhich sediments accumulated. The principal axes of uplift in our area\r\nrange through the North of Scotland towards Scandinavia, across the\r\nSouthern Scotch Uplands to the North of Ireland, through the Lake\r\nDistrict and through Wales. As the result of lateral pressure, a\r\ncleavage structure was impressed on many of the Lower Palæozoic rocks,\r\nthe strike of the rocks extended in the direction of the ridges and\r\ndepressions, and the rocks as a whole became considerably compacted\r\nand hardened, thus producing one of the most important portions of the\r\nframework of our island, for although the ancient mountain chains were\r\nlargely denuded during their elevation, and their stumps were\r\nafterwards covered by later deposits, upon the removal of these, the\r\nancient stumps were once more exposed as fairly rigid masses which do\r\nnot yield greatly to denuding influences, and accordingly stand out as\r\nthe most important upland regions of Britain at the present day.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice, as an illustration of the now well\r\nestablished fact that successive earth movements often occur in the\r\nsame direction, that the axes of the folds produced during this second\r\ncontinental (Devonian) period, run parallel with the lines separating\r\ntracts of different lithological characters. It has been seen that\r\nthe Ordovician and Silurian rocks of the Southern Uplands continue\r\ninto Ireland, and that the beds of similar characters run in belts\r\nhaving a general east-north-east and west-south-west trend, which\r\naccordingly must have been the direction of the coast-line parallel to\r\nwhich they were deposited, and as that coast-line was due to uplift,\r\nthe movement which produced it would naturally produce foldings with\r\neast-north-east and west-south-west trend. This is one of many cases\r\nwhere the lines separating belts of rock having different lithological\r\ncharacters run parallel to axial lines of folds which have been\r\nproduced in the rocks at a later period.\r\n\r\nAs the result of the existence of land over parts of north-west Europe\r\nin Devonian times, it is comparatively rare to find a passage from\r\nnormal Silurian rocks into normal Devonian ones; there is often an\r\nunconformity above the Silurian strata. As we proceed southwards\r\ntowards central Europe, where the epeirogenic and orogenic movements\r\ndied out, this is not the case, and we get complete conformity between\r\nmarine sediments of the Silurian and Devonian periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE DEVONIAN SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification._ As a result of the movements which were briefly\r\ndescribed in the last chapter, two types of Devonian deposit are found\r\nin the British Isles, and are called respectively the Devon type and\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone type. The latter rocks, formerly divided into\r\nthree divisions, are now separated into two only, the upper and lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone, and the exact relation of these to the different\r\nsubdivisions of the rocks of Devon type remains to be settled. The\r\nDevon type itself has given rise to much difference of opinion, two\r\nlocal classifications have been applied, one for the rocks of North\r\nDevon and another for those of South Devon. The classification which\r\nhas been most generally adopted is as follows:--\r\n\r\n                          N. Devon.               S. Devon[83].\r\n\r\n                   { Pilton Beds              { Entomis Slates\r\n  Upper Devonian   { Cucullæa (Marwood)       { Goniatite Limestones\r\n  (Clymenian)      { Beds                     { and Slates\r\n                   { Pickwell Down Sandstone  { Massive Limestones\r\n\r\n  Middle Devonian  { Morte Slates             { Middle Devonian\r\n     (Eifelian)    { Ilfracombe Beds          {  Limestones\r\n                                              { Ashprington Volcanic\r\n                                              {  Series\r\n                                              { Eifelian Slates and\r\n                                              {  Shaly Limestones\r\n\r\n                                              { Lower Devonian\r\n  Lower Devonian   { Hangman Grits            {  Slates\r\n    (Coblenzian)   { Lynton Slates            { Lincombe and Warberry\r\n                   { Foreland Grits           {  Grits and\r\n                                              {  Meadfoot Sands\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: An account of the South Devon rocks by Mr Ussher will be\r\nfound in the _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. XLVI. p. 487; from it\r\nthe above classification of the rocks of S. Devon is taken.]\r\n\r\nThe division into Lower Middle and Upper Devonian is generally\r\nadopted, though the alternative titles given to these divisions are\r\nnot always used with the same signification, and the distribution of\r\nthe different local stages given in the above classifications is\r\nusually adopted in the main, though a detailed comparison of the\r\nDevonian beds of North and South Devon is still attended with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nMore than once an attempt has been made to prove that the apparent\r\nsuccession of the North Devon rocks, which is that given in the above\r\ntable, is not the true one, and of recent years Dr Hicks has obtained\r\na number of fossils from the Morte Slates which had hitherto yielded\r\nnone, and he believes that these fossils indicate that the Morte\r\nSlates are on a lower horizon than the beds on which they rest.\r\nWhatever be the ultimate verdict, we can, at any rate, say that the\r\n\"Devonian Question,\" as it is termed, is not settled[84].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: See Hicks, H., \"On the Morte Slates and Associated Beds\r\nin North Devon and West Somerset,\" _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vols.\r\nLII. p. 254, LIII. p. 438.]\r\n\r\n_Description of the Strata._ The general variations in the\r\nlithological characters of the deposits of Devonian age will be seen\r\nfrom the accompanying figure which represents the deposits of Britain\r\nas they occurred from north to south before they had been affected by\r\nsubsequent earth-movements (Fig. 19). The conventional signs which are\r\nused are similar to those which have been used in other parts of this\r\nwork, and will save description of the section.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.\r\n\r\n  A.

North Devon } Devon Type.\r\n  S.D. South Devon }\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe ridges separate different deposits of Devonian rocks, which were\r\npossibly deposited in isolated areas, though there was probably\r\nconnexion between them at any rate at times.\r\n\r\nThe Old Red Sandstone type consists to a large extent, as the name\r\nimplies, of sandstones which are coloured red by a deposit of peroxide\r\nof iron around the sand grains. They are separable into a lower and\r\nupper division with an unconformity often occurring between them. The\r\nlower Old Red passes down in places into the Silurian rocks with\r\nperfect conformity, and the upper Old Red similarly passes up into the\r\nCarboniferous strata. The existence of pebble beds at different\r\nhorizons is a noteworthy feature. They are frequently found at or near\r\nthe base of the two divisions. The sandstones of the lower division\r\nare often accompanied by flagstones, while the red sandstones of the\r\nupper division usually have deposits of yellow and brown sandstone\r\nintercalated between them. Inconstant beds of limestone, known as\r\ncornstones, are found in both divisions, and Prof. Sollas has shown\r\nthat some of these, at any rate, are true mechanical deposits, formed\r\nby the destruction of pre-existing strata of limestone and the\r\ndeposition of the resulting fragments from a state of suspension. In\r\nScotland a great thickness of volcanic material of various kinds is\r\nassociated with the two divisions. For the sake of simplicity this is\r\nomitted from Fig. 19[85]. It is not known how far normal sediments are\r\nassociated with the Old Red Sandstone type of deposit. The existence\r\nof some in South Wales is suggested by evidence supplied by the late\r\nMr J. W. Salter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: For an account of these and all other British volcanic\r\nrocks the reader is referred to Sir A. Geikie's work on _The Ancient\r\nVolcanoes of Great Britain_. Macmillan and Co., 1897.]\r\n\r\nThe Devon type, as will be seen in the figure, consists of rocks which\r\nare to a great extent of normal character. We find in Devonshire\r\nalternations of sandstones, shales and limestones, but even here, red\r\nsandstones, which are comparable with those of the Old Red type occur\r\nin diminished amount: the Foreland Grits and Pickwell Down Sandstones\r\nare both coloured red, and are like the sandstones formed further\r\nnorth. The recognition of this fact induces one to believe that the\r\ncontrast between the two types of rock which are found at a short\r\ndistance from one another on opposite sides of the Bristol Channel is\r\nnot so marked as one is sometimes led to suppose.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of North Devon differ from those of South Devon chiefly\r\nowing to the amount of calcareous sediment found in the two areas, for\r\nlimestones occur in South Devon to a great extent, and in North Devon\r\nthere is a comparative poverty of this kind of sediment. Here, again,\r\nthe apparent difference is possibly greater than the real one. The\r\nNorth Devon limestones have in places been stretched out after their\r\nformation and thus rendered thinner, and the highly-cleaved limestones\r\nare occasionally mistaken for shales, while in South Devon there is\r\nevidence of thickening of the limestones by folding subsequently to\r\ntheir deposition. Allowing for these changes, however, there is still\r\na marked diminution in the amount of coarse mechanical sediments and\r\nincrease in the quantity of calcareous matter as one passes from North\r\nto South Devon, and this prepares one for the condition of things met\r\nwith on parts of the continent, where the mechanical sediments become\r\nfiner and thinner on the whole as one travels southward, until, when\r\nwe reach the Bohemian area, the Devonian rocks are found to be largely\r\ncomposed of calcareous sediments.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find that in North America the two types of\r\nDevonian strata recur, and present characters generally similar to\r\nthose which they possess upon this side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nPassing now to a consideration of the conditions under which the\r\nDevonian rocks were deposited, we may examine the bearing of the\r\ncharacter of the strata as a whole, and then proceed to more detailed\r\nconsideration of the nature and conditions of deposits of the two\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\nThe gradual increase in calcareous matter and dying out of mechanical\r\nsediments as one travels southward points to recession from land in\r\nthat direction, and we have already seen that the epeirogenic and\r\norogenic movements of this continental period elevated the Silurian\r\nsea-floor in the north, and gave rise to a Northern Continent, while\r\noceanic conditions continued further South, and allowed the\r\naccumulation of sediments lying conformably upon those of Silurian\r\nage, and giving indications of the prevalence of physical conditions\r\nduring Devonian times which were in the main similar to those of the\r\npreceding Silurian period.\r\n\r\nIn the shallow waters adjoining the land of the Northern Continent the\r\nOld Red Sandstones were laid down, and the exact conditions under\r\nwhich they were accumulated is a matter of some interest. The late Sir\r\nAndrew Ramsay gave reasons for supposing that many red deposits were\r\naccumulated in the waters of inland lakes, which underwent rapid\r\nevaporation, and his views have been applied, with much corroborative\r\nevidence by Sir A. Geikie, to account for the red sandstones of\r\nDevonian age, which he believes to have been accumulated in a series\r\nof inland lakes, though others hold a different opinion, and consider\r\nthat the Old Red Sandstone waters had a direct connexion with those of\r\nthe open ocean; the question is too intricate to be discussed at\r\nlength here. Besides the difference of physical characters of the two\r\ntypes of strata, the difference in the nature of their included\r\norganisms is significant. The ordinary invertebrates, as corals,\r\ncrinoids, brachiopods and molluscs are extremely rare in the Old Red\r\nSandstone, which contains remarkable remains of Agnatha fishes and\r\neurypterids, and although these are also found associated with a true\r\nmarine fauna in Russia, Germany and Bohemia, the rarity or apparent\r\nabsence of the ordinary marine invertebrates, though only negative\r\nevidence, which is proverbially dangerous, must be regarded.\r\n\r\nThe North Devon rocks are sediments which might well be accumulated on\r\nthe shores of a continent, while those of South Devon, with their\r\nabundant coral reefs, and other organic limestones were no doubt\r\ndeposited in a clearer sea, at a greater distance from the land, and\r\nthe clear water deposits of Germany and still more of Bohemia, were\r\naccumulated in the open ocean. It is interesting to note in these\r\nBohemian deposits abundance of shells of a Pteropod _Styliola_ which\r\nhas been proved by Prof. H. A. Nicholson to form masses of limestone\r\nin the Devonian system of Canada. The modern distribution of the\r\nPteropoda suggests the open ocean character of the deposits which\r\ncontain them even so far back as Devonian times, though one cannot\r\nconclude that these deposits are really analogous to the so-called\r\nPteropod ooze of modern seas which, as a matter of fact, is largely\r\ncomposed of foraminiferal tests with a considerable percentage of\r\npteropod shells.\r\n\r\n_The Devonian flora and faunas._ The plant remains in the Lower\r\nPalæozoic rocks are few in number. Some undoubted terrestrial plants\r\nhave been discovered, but the prevalent flora of lower Palæozoic\r\ntimes, so far as yet known, was one consisting of Algæ. In Devonian\r\ntimes we begin to meet with a number of Cryptogams of higher type,\r\nallied to those which form the dominant flora of the succeeding\r\nperiod. The fauna is in many ways remarkable. The Devonian period has\r\nbeen termed the period of ganoid fishes, and the remarkable remains,\r\nso graphically described by the late Hugh Miller, are indeed\r\npeculiarly characteristic of Devonian times, but they are largely\r\nthough by no means exclusively entombed in rocks of the Old Red\r\nSandstone type[86]. The Devon type of rock contains a great abundance\r\nand variety of the problematical group, the Stromatoporoids, which\r\ncontribute extensively to the formation of many of the limestones,\r\nand although these organisms are not by any means confined to Devonian\r\nstrata, their abundance and variety therein might lead one to speak of\r\nthe period as that of Stromatoporoids. The remains of corals are very\r\nabundant in the limestones, and, as already stated, frequently give\r\nrise to true reef-masses. The graptolites, as remarked in the previous\r\nchapter, disappear in the rocks of the Devonian period, and as only\r\none or two fragments have been found, we may assert that the group was\r\npractically extinct at the end of Silurian times, though species of\r\none genus, _Monograptus_, lingered for a short time in greatly\r\ndiminished quantity. The trilobites which played so important a part\r\namongst the faunas of Lower Palæozoic times still occur fairly\r\nabundantly amongst the rocks of the Devonian system, and there is a\r\nvery interesting point to be noticed in connexion with them. They seem\r\nto have become practically extinct in the succeeding Carboniferous\r\nperiod, where few genera are found, and the decadence of the group\r\nbegan in Devonian times. In these circumstances it is interesting to\r\nnote the tendency displayed by the creatures to possess spiny\r\ncoverings. It is true that _Acidaspis_, the most spinose of all\r\ntrilobites, is abundant in Ordovician and Silurian strata, and that\r\nother spinose trilobites are found there, but the peculiarity of the\r\nDevonian trilobites is, that genera which were previously smooth, or\r\nrarely possessing one or few spines, are found represented by\r\nextremely spinose species in these beds,--the spines being developed\r\nfrom all parts of the test, sometimes as a fringe to head or tail,\r\nsometimes as prominent projections from glabella and neck segment, and\r\nfrequently in rows down the body segments. Besides _Acidaspis_, we\r\nfind spinose species of _Phacops_, _Homalonotus_, _Cyphaspis_,\r\n_Bronteus_ and _Encrinurus_ in Devonian strata, and the occurrence of\r\nthese forms is so frequent and world-wide, that one might perhaps\r\ninfer with confidence that an unknown fauna containing many spiny\r\ntrilobites was of Devonian age.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: For an account of these see A. S. Woodward's _Vertebrate\r\nPalæontology_.]\r\n\r\nThe abundance of Eurypterids has been previously noted. Occurring as\r\nthey do in Silurian rocks, they are far more abundant in those of\r\nDevonian age, and are found indifferently in sediments of Old Red and\r\nDevon types. Of air breathers, several insects have been found in the\r\nstrata of different parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary marine faunas are otherwise intermediate in character\r\nbetween those of the Silurian and Carboniferous periods, but there are\r\nseveral characteristic Devonian genera, and no one who is acquainted\r\nwith the peculiarity of the Devonian fauna would deny to the Devonian\r\nstrata the right to rank as a separate system, containing a fauna as\r\nwell marked in its way as that of the Silurian system below or that of\r\nthe Carboniferous above. Special stress is laid upon this point\r\nbecause it has been suggested that the Devonian system should be\r\nabolished, and its strata either divided between the Silurian and\r\nCarboniferous systems or referred exclusively to the latter\r\nsystem[87].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: The literature of the fauna of the Devonian rocks is a\r\nrich one. For an account of the Devonian rocks of Britain, the reader\r\nmay consult the Monograph of the Devonian Fossils of the South of\r\nEngland by Rev. G. F. Whidbourne, which is now appearing in the series\r\nof Monographs of the Palæontographical Society, and in the\r\npublications of the same Society he will find a Monograph of the\r\nEurypterids from the pen of Dr Henry Woodward. The richest Devonian\r\nfauna is undoubtedly that of the Bohemian area, for the work of Dr E.\r\nKayser has conclusively proved that the stages _F_, _G_ and _H_ of\r\nthat basin, formerly referred to the Silurian, are of Devonian age,\r\nand an excellent idea of the richness of the Devonian fauna may be\r\nobtained by studying the descriptions of the fossils from those stages\r\nwhich have appeared and are appearing in Barrande's classic work.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CARBONIFEROUS SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Classification._ The British rocks of the Carboniferous system\r\nhave been classified according to their lithological characters, but\r\nas the classification has been altered from time to time, we may use\r\nthat which seems most acceptable to the majority of British geologists\r\nat the present day. According to this, the beds are grouped as\r\nbelow:--\r\n\r\n                      {                  { Ardwick Stage\r\n  Upper Carboniferous { Coal Measures    { Pennant Stage\r\n                      {                  { Gannister Stage\r\n                      { Millstone Grit\r\n  Lower Carboniferous { Carboniferous (Mountain) Limestone\r\n                      { Series.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Carboniferous beds have been further subdivided into:--\r\n\r\n    Yoredale Series or Upper Limestone Shales,\r\n    Mountain Limestone,\r\n    Lower Limestone Shales, with Sandstones and Conglomerates,\r\n\r\nbut as these lithological types are found to be very variable when\r\ntraced laterally for comparatively short distances, it is found more\r\nsatisfactory to use the terms in a purely lithological sense rather\r\nthan with chronological significance.\r\n\r\nThe somewhat abnormal development of the higher portions of the\r\nCarboniferous rocks of Britain renders the local classification only\r\npartially applicable in other regions, and as our knowledge\r\nprogresses, a palæontological classification will probably be adopted.\r\nThis has already been done with the more purely open-water sediments\r\nof Russia and Eastern Asia, where the development of the beds is more\r\nnormal. There the rocks are classified as under:--\r\n\r\n    Upper Carboniferous or Gshellian,\r\n    Middle Carboniferous or Moscovian,\r\n    Lower Carboniferous,\r\n\r\nand as this classification has already been found to be applicable\r\nover rather wide areas, it is almost certain that, as in the case of\r\nthe rocks of other systems, it will prove more serviceable than one\r\nwhich is mainly (though not quite exclusively) based upon vertical\r\nvariation of lithological characters, especially as the Carboniferous\r\nrocks over large tracts in North America possess faunas which are\r\nsimilar to those which have been discovered in Russia, Eastern Asia\r\nand North Africa.\r\n\r\n_Description of the strata._ The variations in the lithological\r\ncharacters and fossil contents of the British Carboniferous strata\r\nwhen traced from north to south have been so frequently described, and\r\nutilised as a means of illustrating the indications as to local\r\nvariations in physical conditions which are supplied by those strata,\r\nthat little need be said upon the subject. The restoration of the\r\nphysical geography of Carboniferous times over the British area will\r\nbe found in a chapter by the late Professor Green in the work upon\r\n_Coal_ by various professors at the Yorkshire College of Science and\r\nalso in Prof. Hull's _Physical History of the British Isles_. Some\r\nmodifications must be made in these restorations as the result of\r\nrecent research, the principal being caused by discoveries amongst the\r\nCarboniferous rocks of Devonshire.\r\n\r\nTaking the strata in vertical succession, we find evidence of the\r\noccurrence of a complete marine period (the second great marine\r\nperiod) between the second and third continental periods. The first\r\nshallow-water phase over a great portion of the British Isles is\r\nmarked by thin terrigenous sediments, indicating that the period was a\r\nbrief one; it was followed by the deep-water phase, probably of some\r\nlength, lasting through the greater part of the remainder of Lower\r\nCarboniferous times; while the concluding shallow-water phase was\r\nlengthy as compared with that of the beginning of the period, and is\r\nmarked by the accumulation of the great thickness of deposits\r\nbelonging to the Millstone Grit and Coal Measures. There is no doubt,\r\nhowever, that in some parts of the British area minor changes produced\r\nlocal terrestrial conditions during the period, and accordingly we\r\nfind that the deepest water deposits of the system in Britain are\r\nsucceeded by an unconformable junction with the sediments of the upper\r\nportion of the system.\r\n\r\nThe general change in the lithological characters of the beds of the\r\nLower Carboniferous division when traced from south to north is shewn\r\nin the following diagram (Fig. 20).\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the land and open sea areas were in the\r\nrespective positions which they occupied during Devonian times, but\r\nthat as the result of greater submergence, with which the accumulation\r\nof sediment did not keep pace, the shallow-water marine deposits of\r\nDevonian age are in Devon replaced by open-sea deposits[88], while\r\nshallow-water marine deposits further north replace the anomalous\r\ndeposits which were found there during the Devonian period.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: The Radiolarian Cherts of the Lower Carboniferous rocks\r\nof Devon, and the associated sediments, together with the unconformity\r\nbetween these and the Upper Carboniferous beds are described by Messrs\r\nHinde and Fox, Quart. _Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. LI. p. 609.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.\r\n\r\n    _a._ Radiolarian cherts of Devon.\r\n    _b._ Mountain limestone of Central England.\r\n    _c._ Mechanical sediments of Northern England.\r\n    _d._ Freshwater deposits of Southern Scotland.\r\n    O.R. Older rocks.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOwing to the accumulation of thick masses of sediment, the Lower\r\nCarboniferous sea of the north of England appears to have been largely\r\nsilted up, and although the organic deposits of the south are so thin\r\nthat they did not render the sea shallow in that region, the general\r\nlevel of the Lower Carboniferous floor of the south was also uplifted,\r\nand actually converted into land, as the result of the upward movement\r\nwhich took place in Devonshire and tracts of France; and owing to\r\nsilting up in the north, and elevation in the south, a general plane\r\nsurface was produced over very extensive areas, not only in Britain\r\nbut upon the Continent, upon which the peculiar deposits and\r\naccumulations of Upper Carboniferous times were laid down, sometimes\r\nin shallow water, sometimes upon the land, and often under conditions\r\nwhich cannot at present be determined with accuracy. That the deposits\r\nof the Millstone Grit and Coal Measure epochs were to a large extent\r\nlaid down in water is admitted by all, and in the case of many of the\r\ndeposits of the Millstone Grit, and some thin deposits of the Coal\r\nMeasures, it is equally clear that the water area was part of an\r\nexpanse of ocean, for we find marine fossils, as corals, crinoids, and\r\ncephalopods, in these beds. Associated with them in the Coal Measures\r\nare other beds in which the ordinary Carboniferous genera of marine\r\ninvertebrates are absent, and their place is taken by shells which\r\nbear much resemblance to the modern fresh-water mussel, and it has\r\nbeen maintained with good reason that as the ordinary marine forms are\r\nrarely or never mixed with those resembling recent fresh-water shells,\r\nthe latter are truly fresh-water[89]. If this be so, many of the\r\nmechanically formed sediments of the Coal Measures were of fresh-water\r\norigin, laid down in shallow lagoon-like expanses, probably shut off\r\nfrom the main ocean by a narrow portion of intervening land, which was\r\noccasionally destroyed, thus permitting incursions of salt-water when\r\nsome of the ordinary marine invertebrates of the period obtained a\r\ntemporary footing in the area.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: For further information upon this subject the student\r\nshould consult the Introduction to a Monograph on _Carbonicola_,\r\n_Anthracomya_ and _Naiadites_ (the shells in question) by Dr Wheelton\r\nHind, being one of the Monographs of the Palæontographical Society.]\r\n\r\nThere is not only a difference of opinion as to the mode of\r\naccumulation of many of the mechanical sediments of the Coal Measures,\r\nbut also as to that of the coal-seams which accompanied them. Two\r\ndifferent theories have been put forward to account for these\r\ncoal-seams, which are usually spoken of as the drift theory and the\r\ngrowth-in-place theory. According to the former, in its extreme\r\napplication, coal is an aqueous deposit formed by the settlement of\r\ndrifted masses of vegetation upon the floor of a water-tract, while\r\nthose who push the growth-in-place theory to its extreme limits\r\nmaintain that coal is the result of growth of vegetation upon the\r\nactual site where the coal is now found. Much apparently conflicting\r\nevidence has been advanced by the advocates of the two hypotheses, and\r\nspecial cases of coal-formation have been appealed to by each in\r\nsupport of their views; thus the existence of coal composed largely of\r\nbodies which resemble the spores of modern lycopods,--objects of so\r\nresinous a nature that they float on the surface until they are\r\ndecomposed,--is cited by the upholders of the growth-in-place theory,\r\nwhile the supporters of the other hypothesis can point with equal\r\nforce to the occurrence of the finely divided carbonaceous mud\r\ncontaining remains of fishes which gives rise to cannel coal in some\r\nplaces. One of the main assertions in support of the growth-in-place\r\ntheory was that of the supposed universality of 'underclays' or old\r\nsurface soils beneath all coal-seams, but though these are common,\r\nthey are far from universal. It is impossible to do justice in small\r\ncompass to this question of coal-formation, but it may be pointed out\r\nthat much of the difference of opinion can be understood if it be\r\nremembered that the term 'coal' is rather a popular term which has\r\nbeen admitted into scientific terminology, and therefore used somewhat\r\nloosely, than a strictly scientific term applied to a definite\r\nsubstance, and accordingly, just as at the present day we find\r\ncarbonaceous substances growing in one place on land to form peat, in\r\nother places on a tract sometimes dry and sometimes submerged, to form\r\nthe carbonaceous deposits of the cypress-swamps, and once more\r\naccumulated beneath the shallows of a sea as a sediment to form the\r\ncarbonaceous muds of the ocean margins where the mangroves grow, so\r\nthe diverse substances which are included under the general term coal\r\nmay have accumulated in one place on land, in another beneath water,\r\nand in a third on an area alternately dry and submerged. This is not a\r\nquestion of great importance; the important point is that\r\naccumulations of vegetation on a fairly large scale are found at the\r\npresent day on plains, for even if they grow on mountain regions, the\r\ndeposits are readily denuded before they are covered up, and also it\r\nmust be noted that a moist climate is necessary for the growth of much\r\nvegetation. The conclusion that the accumulations of coaly matter were\r\nformed on plains is borne out by their great horizontal extent as\r\ncompared with their thickness, and it is now generally agreed that the\r\ncoal vegetation which is found in the normal coal-measures was\r\nessentially a swamp vegetation.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made to prove that an upland vegetation of very\r\ndifferent character existed contemporaneously with it, but reasons\r\nwill be given in the sequel for concluding that this supposed upland\r\nCarboniferous flora is everywhere of later date.\r\n\r\nThe later shallow-water phase of Carboniferous times, as already\r\nstated, was unusually long, it was also very widespread, and appears\r\nto have been accompanied over wide areas by humid conditions during\r\nits continuance, and accordingly the marsh conditions which existed\r\nduring Upper Carboniferous times were probably on a larger scale than\r\nthat of similar conditions before or after. Special stress is laid\r\nupon this fact, as it is a good illustration of the view which seems\r\nto be gaining ground, that every period possessed peculiar conditions\r\nnever to be repeated, which must have left their impress upon the\r\ncharacter of the sediments.\r\n\r\nThough the conditions above described were widespread, they were\r\nnaturally not universal, and accordingly in many parts of the world,\r\nas previously stated, we find true marine deposits of Upper\r\nCarboniferous times, though even these were sometimes replaced during\r\npart of the epoch, by conditions which were favourable for the\r\nformation of coal-seams in those places. Interruption in the\r\ncontinuance of a humid temperate climate over the regions of\r\nNorth-West Europe is also suggested by the discovery of deposits which\r\nare maintained to be of glacial origin amongst the Coal Measures of\r\nFrance[90].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: For an account of the numerous volcanic products see Sir\r\nA. Geikie's work on \"The Ancient Volcanoes of Great Britain.\"]\r\n\r\n_The Floras and Faunas._ The flora of the Carboniferous rock is so\r\nnoteworthy that the period has been termed the Period of Cryptogams;\r\nthe remains of ferns, horsetails, and clubmosses predominate, and many\r\nof the forms reached a gigantic size. Though the floras of the various\r\nstages are marked by a general resemblance, there are differences\r\nwhich enable the palæobotanist to ascertain the stratigraphical\r\nposition of the beds by reference to the included plant remains, and a\r\nconsiderable number of successive floras have been described[91]. The\r\ninvertebrate fauna does not differ on the whole very greatly from that\r\nof Devonian times, though the trilobites are now becoming rare, and\r\nthe mollusca assume a more prominent position as compared with the\r\nbrachiopods. Corals occur in abundance in the calcareous deposits of\r\nthe period, and frequently give rise to sheets of reef-formation, but\r\nthe foraminifera and crinoidea certainly play the principal part as\r\nlimestone-producers, and the influence of the latter in giving rise to\r\ngreat masses of limestone which are frequently used for ornamental\r\npurposes is too well known to need more than passing reference. The\r\nair-breathers have also been detected in greater abundance, though\r\nthey are rare, when we consider the comparatively favourable\r\nconditions for their preservation presented by the Coal Measure rocks.\r\nMyriopods, arachnids, insects and pulmoniferous gastropods have\r\nhowever been found with tolerable frequency. The danger of arguing\r\nfrom imperfect data is well illustrated by the great addition to our\r\nknowledge of the insect-fauna of these times due to the exploration of\r\nthe beds of one small coal-field, that of Commentry in France, of\r\nwhich the insects have been described by M. C. Brongniart. The\r\nvertebrates are represented by a considerable variety of fishes, and\r\nless abundant though tolerably numerous remains of Amphibia, which\r\noccur in the Carboniferous rocks of the North of England, Ireland,\r\nFrance, North America and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: Consult Kidston, R., \"On the Various Divisions of the\r\nCarboniferous Rocks as determined by their Fossil Flora,\" _Proc. Roy.\r\nPhys. Soc. Edin._, vol. XII. p. 183.]\r\n\r\nThe existence of definite zones of organisms in the case of the\r\nCarboniferous rocks has been denied, and it appears to be considered\r\nby some that the Carboniferous rocks were accumulated so rapidly as\r\ncompared with rocks of some other systems that the fauna remained very\r\nsimilar throughout. It is very doubtful if this was so. In the case of\r\nother systems, the division into zones has only been accomplished by\r\nmeans of more detailed researches than those which have been conducted\r\namongst the Carboniferous rocks of Britain: again, the occurrence of\r\nsuccessive floras suggests that there may have been a similar\r\nsuccession amongst the faunas, and finally we find that zonal division\r\nhas been carried on to some extent amongst the Carboniferous strata\r\nof other regions. The following classification of the Russian type of\r\nsediment may prove useful, as an indication of the possibility of more\r\ndetailed separation of our own beds:--\r\n\r\n                        { Beds with _Spirifera fascigera_, _Spiriferina_\r\n       Gshellian        {   _Saranae_, &c.\r\n  (with _Fusulina_ and  { Beds with _Producta cora_, _P. uralica_,\r\n    _Archimedipora_)    {   _Camarophoria crumena_, &c.\r\n                        { Beds with _Syringopora parallela_ and\r\n                        {   _Spirifera striata_.\r\n\r\n     Moscovian          { Stage of _Spirifera mosquensis_.\r\n\r\n                        { Stage of _Spirifera Kleini_.\r\n                        { Coals, Sandstones and Shales with _Noeggerathia_\r\n  Lower Carboniferous   {   _tenuistriata_ and _Producta_\r\n                        {   _gigantea_.\r\n                        { Stage of _Producta mesoloba_.\r\n\r\nThe marine fauna of the Upper Carboniferous beds, which is so poorly\r\nrepresented in Britain, but is well developed in Spain, Russia, Asia\r\nand North America, is largely characterised by the abundance of\r\nforaminifers of the genus _Fusulina_ and _Fusulinella_ and of bryozoa\r\nof the genus _Archimedipora_. It is very desirable that the truly\r\nmarine fauna of the _Spirorbis_ limestone and other marine bands of\r\nthe British Coal Measures should be carefully studied to see if they\r\npresent any close relationship with that of the Gshellian beds[92].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: A good idea of the general characters of the\r\nCarboniferous fauna of Britain will be obtained from an examination of\r\nProfessor Phillips' _Geology of Yorkshire_, Part I., and Mr (now Sir\r\nF.) M^{c}Coy's _Carboniferous Fossils of Ireland_, while the nature of\r\nthe European fauna is well illustrated in Prof. de Koninck's\r\nwell-known work _Description des animaux fossiles qui se trouvent dans\r\nle terrain carbonifère de Belgique_. For an account of the characters\r\nof the marine fauna of the Upper Carboniferous rocks the reader should\r\nconsult the work on Geology and Palæontology published by the\r\nGeological Survey of the State of Illinois in 1866.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGES WHICH OCCURRED DURING THE THIRD CONTINENTAL PERIOD IN\r\nBRITAIN; AND THE FOREIGN PERMO-CARBONIFEROUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of Carboniferous times a marked change took place in the\r\nnature of the earth-movements. The prevalent depression which occurred\r\nover the British and adjoining regions during Carboniferous times was\r\nreplaced by upward movement, accompanied by orogenic folds, which once\r\nmore brought on continental conditions and developed a series of\r\nmountain ranges. The change is marked even at the close of\r\nCarboniferous times by the abnormal red sandstones of the uppermost\r\npart of the Carboniferous system which are found around Whitehaven in\r\nCumberland and Rotherham in Yorkshire, as the Whitehaven Sandstone and\r\nRotherham Red Rock. These movements continued through Permian and\r\nTriassic times, and it is to them and to the climatic conditions of\r\nthe periods, that the anomalous nature of the Permo-Triassic deposits\r\nis largely due, as will be shewn in the succeeding chapters. At\r\npresent it is our purpose to call attention to the effect of these\r\nmovements upon the sediments which had been deposited previously to\r\ntheir occurrence.\r\n\r\nOver the British area, two different systems of orogenic movement can\r\nbe detected, producing folds of which the axes run approximately at\r\nright angles to one another. One of these, of which the Pennine system\r\nis the best representative in Britain, caused the production of\r\nelevations having axes in a general north and south direction, and we\r\nmay therefore speak of it as the Pennine system of movement, while the\r\nother, which gave rise to folds running in an east and west direction,\r\nis well represented in the Mendip Hills, and may be therefore termed\r\nthe Mendip system, though it is more widely known as the Hercynian\r\nsystem, as, on the Continent, the rocks which are greatly affected by\r\nit form the foundations of the region occupied by the ancient\r\nHercynian forest.\r\n\r\nThe effects of these systems were in the main similar; they resulted\r\nin the uplift of parallel belts of country to form hill-ranges with\r\nintervening lowlands, but when studied in detail the movements are\r\nseen to be of a different character. The Pennine system of movements\r\nwas of a type which is familiar to the geologists as developed in the\r\nGreat Basin Region of the western territories of North America, and\r\nproduced what is spoken of as Basin-Range structure. The movements\r\nwere of the nature of direct uplift, causing fracture, only\r\naccompanied by folding in a minor degree, and accordingly the hills\r\nare composed of terraced scarps, with one gently sloping side, and one\r\nsteep scarp-side, the latter on the upthrow side of the fault, as seen\r\nin fig. 21.\r\n\r\nIn the Mendip system, the folds were of the Alpine type, which is a\r\nfamiliar product of lateral pressure, consisting essentially of\r\noverfolds, though these are often complicated by reversed faults.\r\n\r\nOf the Pennine system, the Pennine Chain itself furnishes the most\r\nnoteworthy example in Britain, but we have indications of other folds\r\nof this system, such as that which runs from the Lake District to the\r\nAyrshire coast, which is partly concealed as the result of other\r\nmovements, and a still more marked one, in the rocks of the Malvern\r\nHills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.\r\n\r\n_a a´_. One stratum displaced by faults _f f_. _h._ Hills.]\r\n\r\nThe Mendip system is well shewn in the Mendip Hills, but the remains\r\nof a still more important anticline are seen in South Devon and\r\nCornwall, separated from the Mendip Hills by the great syncline of\r\nDevon. Another parallel anticline runs from Lancashire to Yorkshire at\r\nright angles to the Pennine Chain and separates the coal-field of\r\nCumberland and that of Northumberland and Durham, from those of South\r\nLancashire, and Yorkshire, Notts, and Derbyshire.\r\n\r\nOn the European continent the Ural Chain is the most important uplift\r\nof the system of which the Pennine Chain forms a minor representative,\r\nwhile the Hercynian system has caused the compression and stiffening\r\nof many of the Carboniferous and earlier rocks which now rise to the\r\nsurface in many parts of central Europe.\r\n\r\nThe extensive continental area which was the result of these uplifts\r\nnot only determined the formation of abnormal deposits, but allowed\r\nthe occurrence of a long period of time subsequently to the close of\r\nthe Carboniferous period, of which few deposits now exposed in Europe\r\nare representative, and we must accordingly seek other regions in\r\norder to find typical representatives of this _Permo-Carboniferous_\r\nperiod, of which the strata developed in the Salt Range of India have\r\nbeen most carefully worked, especially by Dr Waagen, though marine\r\nsediments of the period are known elsewhere, as in Spitsbergen, the\r\nUral Mountains, China and Australasia; and a group of somewhat\r\nanomalous sediments of this age in parts of India, Australia and South\r\nAmerica is of peculiar interest, on account of the insight as to the\r\nclimatic conditions of the times which it affords.\r\n\r\n_The Permo-Carboniferous Rocks._ In the Salt Range of the North-West\r\nof India an interesting series of sandstones alternating with\r\nlimestones rests unconformably upon lower rocks. The sandstones are\r\nknown as the Speckled Sandstones, while the limestones are termed the\r\n_Productus_ Limestones. The Lower and Middle Speckled Sandstones are\r\nsucceeded by the Lower _Productus_ Limestone which is separated from\r\nthe Lower division of the Middle _Productus_ Limestone by the Upper\r\nSpeckled Sandstone; these are all of the Permo-Carboniferous period,\r\nwhile the upper part of the Middle _Productus_ Limestone and the Upper\r\n_Productus_ Limestone belongs to the Permian period. The fossils,\r\nlargely invertebrates, are intermediate in character between those of\r\nCarboniferous and Permian ages. Similar fossils are found in the\r\nmarine Permo-Carboniferous beds of the other areas which have been\r\nnamed above. The Lower Speckled Sandstone is of interest on account of\r\nthe occurrence of boulder-beds within it, and this division of the\r\nsandstone has been correlated with the lowest (Talchir) stage of the\r\nPermo-Carboniferous strata of other parts of India, while the other\r\nSpeckled Sandstones and those divisions of _Productus_ Limestone which\r\nare referred to the Permo-Carboniferous are correlated with the higher\r\ndivisions of other parts.\r\n\r\nSpecial mention is made of the Talchir division, on account of the\r\noccurrence therein of boulder beds which have long been known, and\r\nwhose glacial origin was inferred by Dr W. T. Blanford forty years\r\nago. The accumulations shew signs of having been deposited in water,\r\nbut the existence of large subangular, sometimes striated boulders\r\ntherein, which must have come from distant sources, and the occasional\r\noccurrence of striated rock surfaces on the strata upon which the\r\nTalchir beds repose unconformably points to ice-action; this would not\r\nbe so very remarkable if it were an isolated case, though sufficiently\r\nso, from the comparative nearness of the region to the equator; but\r\nresearches conducted in different parts of the southern hemisphere\r\nhave brought to light similar, and sometimes even more striking\r\nevidences of glacial action in widely distinct regions[93]. In\r\nAustralia they have been found in New South Wales, Victoria,\r\nSouth Australia, East Australia and Tasmania; the Dwyka\r\nboulder-conglomerates of South Africa and certain deposits of similar\r\ncharacter discovered by Prof. Derby in Southern Brazil have been\r\nreferred to the same period, and their glacial origin has also been\r\ninferred. This widespread distribution of deposits which are generally\r\ncontemporaneous, of which the glacial origin may now be taken as\r\nestablished, is extremely remarkable, and must be taken into careful\r\nconsideration by those who put forward theories framed to account for\r\nformer climatic changes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: The reader will find an excellent account of the\r\nPermo-Carboniferous glacial deposits in a paper by Prof. Edgworth\r\nDavid, entitled \"Evidences of Glacial Action in Australia in\r\nPermo-Carboniferous Time\" (_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ Vol. LII. p.\r\n289). In this paper other glacial beds besides those of Australia are\r\nnoticed.]\r\n\r\n_The Flora and Fauna._ The flora of the Permo-Carboniferous beds has\r\ncaused as much discussion as the question concerning the origin of the\r\nboulder-deposits. In the southern hemisphere, the Permo-Carboniferous\r\nrocks of those countries which have yielded boulder-beds also contain\r\nremains of a flora which is now known as the _Glossopteris_ flora,\r\nfrom the prevailing genus, which is associated with other genera, such\r\nas _Gangamopteris_. These fossils appear to be ferns, though their\r\nmodern allies have not been indicated with certainty; associated with\r\nthem are rare cycads and conifers. The _Glossopteris_ flora is\r\nmarkedly contrasted with the Coal-Measure flora of the northern\r\nhemisphere with its giant lycopods. Moreover _Glossopteris_ appears in\r\nthe northern hemisphere in rocks of later date than the\r\nPermo-Carboniferous period. It has been suggested that the\r\n_Glossopteris_ flora originated in a continent in the southern\r\nhemisphere, on which the boulder beds were also formed in isolated\r\nwater areas, and that some of the forms migrated northwards. To this\r\ncontinent the name Gondwanaland has been applied by Prof. Suess, from\r\nthe _Gondwana_ series of the Permo-Carboniferous rocks of India, in\r\nwhich the _Glossopteris_ flora is found, and it has also been\r\nmaintained that the southern _Glossopteris_ flora was contemporaneous\r\nwith the northern flora of ordinary Coal-measure type, though whether\r\nthis was so to any extent remains to be proved, for the beds\r\ncontaining the _Glossopteris_ flora are distinctly newer than any\r\nwhich have furnished a typical northern Coal-measure flora. In\r\nany case, the change of floras between Coal Measure and\r\nPermo-Carboniferous times is very marked, and when taken in connexion\r\nwith the widespread glacial deposits, is one of the most striking\r\nphenomena displayed by the rocks of the stratified column[94].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: For an account of the Glossopteris flora and its\r\ngeological relations, consult Seward, A. C., _Science Progress_,\r\nJanuary, 1897, p. 178.]\r\n\r\nThe fauna has already been noticed. It consists of brachiopods, some\r\nof which are of peculiar genera. The general similarity of the faunas\r\nin regions so remote as Spitsbergen, the Ural Mountains, India, and\r\nNew South Wales, indicates an extensive sea during the period. It can\r\nhardly be supposed that the fauna of Permo-Carboniferous times has\r\nbeen completely described, for the fossils of one or two areas only\r\nhave been made known to us with any degree of fulness, and when the\r\nPermo-Carboniferous and marine Permian faunas are as well known as\r\nthose of Triassic times (and the latter have only been fully described\r\nvery recently) there is no doubt that the important break which was at\r\none time supposed to exist between Palæozoic and Mesozoic faunas will\r\nbe filled in satisfactorily[95].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: The Permo-Carboniferous beds are described in Messrs\r\nMedlicott and Blanford's _Geology of India_, second edition (edited by\r\nMr R. D. Oldham), and figures of some of the important fossils given\r\ntherein. For fuller information the reader should refer to Waagen's\r\naccount of the Salt Range Fossils and Feistmantel's description of the\r\nplants in the _Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE PERMIAN SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification._ It has already been observed that as the result of\r\nthe Pennine and Mendip systems of earth-movement, the Carboniferous\r\nrocks of Britain are succeeded by a marked unconformity, and that the\r\nrocks of the succeeding Permian and Triassic systems of Britain shew\r\nan abnormal development. The principal areas where Permian rocks are\r\nfound are on either side of the Pennine Chain in the North of England,\r\nbut sporadic exposures of rocks of this age are found in some of the\r\nMidland and Southern counties. The Permian rocks have been well\r\nstudied in Germany, and the German names are sometimes adopted in\r\nBritain, and the following comparison will prove useful:--\r\n\r\n           Britain.

The Marl Slate is an\r\nargillaceous shale, often containing bituminous matter, and yielding\r\nseveral fish-remains and some plants; it is usually only a few feet in\r\nthickness. The Magnesian Limestone is typically developed in Durham as\r\na yellow or greyish limestone containing a variable percentage of\r\ncarbonate of magnesia; when traced southward, it alters its\r\ncharacters, becoming mixed with mechanical deposits, and some chemical\r\nprecipitates in places, so that at Mansfield it appears as a red\r\nsandstone with grains cemented by a mixture of carbonates of lime and\r\nmagnesia; and, like the rest of the Permian strata, it has disappeared\r\nwhen we reach Nottingham. In addition to the southward thinning of the\r\nPermian beds of this area, there is some evidence of their\r\ndisappearance in a westerly direction, though, as the present strike\r\nof the beds is nearly north and south, the indications of this are\r\nless convincing.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of the Pennine Chain, the main difference observable\r\nis the relative thickness of the major divisions. The Lower Permian\r\nsandstones have thickened out considerably, while the reputed\r\nrepresentatives of the Magnesian Limestone are thin. The Penrith\r\nsandstone is of considerable interest. It contains in places, as near\r\nAppleby, thick deposits of breccia consisting of angular fragments\r\nchiefly composed of Carboniferous Limestone, which in many cases have\r\nundergone subsequent dolomitisation, embedded in a matrix of red\r\nsandstone. This breccia is known as brockram. Many beds of the Penrith\r\nsandstone are composed of crystalline grains of sand, due to\r\ndeposition of silica in crystalline continuity with the quartz of the\r\noriginal grain after the formation of the deposit; of more\r\nsignificance, for our present purpose, is the presence of other\r\naccumulations of the sand, in which the individual grains often\r\napproach the form of spheres, thus resembling the 'millet-seed' sands\r\nof modern desert regions. The Hilton shales are grey sandy shales,\r\nwith plant remains, and above them are variable deposits including\r\nthin magnesian limestones which have yielded no fossils.\r\n\r\nThe isolated Permian deposits of the midland and southern counties of\r\nEngland consist of red marls and sandstones with occasional breccias,\r\nand in the absence of fossils, their exact position in the Permian\r\nseries is still unknown.\r\n\r\nThe German Permian rocks resemble those of Britain, especially as seen\r\nin Durham, in many particulars, and give indications of formation\r\nunder physical and climatic conditions generally similar to those\r\nwhich were then prevalent in the British area. At Stassfurt, in\r\nGermany, the less soluble constituents of ocean water are accompanied\r\nby a great variety of salts:--chlorides, sulphates and borates; and\r\nthe very soluble salts of potassium and magnesium known as the Abraum\r\nsalts are found in abundance as well as the less soluble salts of\r\nsodium and calcium. The occurrence of these very soluble salts is so\r\ninfrequent on a large scale among the rocks of the Geological Column,\r\nand the matter is one of so great theoretical import, that it is\r\nnecessary to take special note of their presence in the Permian\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nThe frequent existence of chemical deposits in the Permian Rocks of\r\nN.W. Europe, the formation of red sandstones, and the dolomitisation\r\nof limestone beds and fragments of pre-existing limestones point to\r\ninland seas of a Caspian character, while the evaporation necessary\r\nfor the formation of the precipitates also indicates a fairly warm\r\ntemperature. The presence of millet-seed sands, in very lenticular\r\npatches, suggesting former sand-dunes, and the occurrence in places of\r\nbreccias (like some parts of the brockram) almost devoid of matrix,\r\npiled up against pre-existing cliffs, recalling screes of modern\r\ntimes, give almost certain evidence of the occurrence of land tracts\r\nmost probably of desert character, during part of the period of\r\naccumulation of the materials of the Permian rocks. The fossil\r\nevidence supports this view, and geologists are mostly agreed that the\r\nPermian rocks of north-west Europe were accumulated in an area of\r\ndesert character, occupied in part by inland seas, though there is\r\nmuch difference of opinion as to the extent of these seas, some\r\ngeologists holding that a number of isolated sheets of water were\r\nnecessary to produce the distribution and character of the\r\naccumulations. It is still a vexed question with British geologists\r\nhow far the Pennine ridge stood up as land during the period, but\r\nleaving this and other minor considerations out of account, it may be\r\nnoted that the similarity of deposits in the different areas, whether\r\nwe examine the order of succession, the lithological characters or the\r\nincluded fossils, suggests communication between the water tracts of\r\ndifferent regions, though this communication need not have been more\r\nthan a series of straits, or comparatively narrow belts of water[96].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: It should be mentioned that some writers have inferred\r\nthe evidence of glacial conditions over parts of the British area, on\r\naccount of the resemblance of some of the Permian breccias to recent\r\nglacial deposits. The question is still _sub judice_. It is not\r\nnecessarily opposed to the existence of desert conditions, if the\r\nmountains were sufficiently high, for the Wahsatch regions adjoining\r\nthe Basin Region of N. America have been glaciated.]\r\n\r\nThe extensive development of Permian and Triassic rocks with\r\nterrestrial characters in the southern hemisphere also, and the\r\nabsence of newer deposits in many places, suggests that the land areas\r\nof these times in that hemisphere have largely remained such ever\r\nsince, in which case, the Permo-Triassic series of movements produced\r\na marked direct effect upon our present continental areas, and at any\r\nrate produced an indirect one upon the British land tracts.\r\n\r\nThe presence of anomalous deposits of Permian age over wide areas need\r\nnot be surprising, but it would be indeed remarkable if no ordinary\r\nmarine type of Permian rocks was known, and the researches of recent\r\nyears have proved that this type is extensively developed, in Eastern\r\nEurope, Asia, and North America, where Permian rocks consisting of\r\nlimestones, with a greater or less admixture of mechanical deposits,\r\noccur in some abundance. The studies of Waagen and others in India\r\nhave given us the farthest insight into the nature of these beds.\r\nBelow is a general classification taken from Waagen's work:--\r\n\r\n       Salt Range.                       Germany.\r\n\r\n  Base of Trias                 }\r\n  Unfossiliferous Shale and     }\r\n    Sandstone                   } Passage Beds into Trias\r\n  Top Beds of Upper _Productus_ }\r\n    Limestone                   }\r\n\r\n  Cephalopoda Beds of Upper     } Gypsum Beds\r\n    _Productus_ Limestone       }\r\n\r\n  Middle Division of Upper      }\r\n    _Productus_ Limestone       } Zechstein (in restricted sense)\r\n  Lower Division of Upper       }\r\n    _Productus_ Limestone       }\r\n\r\n  Upper Division of Middle      } Weissliegende and Kupferschiefer\r\n    _Productus_ Limestone       }\r\n\r\n  Middle Division of Middle     } Rothliegende.\r\n    _Productus_ Limestone       }\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that in the Salt Range there is a complete passage\r\nfrom the Permo-Carboniferous strata through the Permian into the\r\nTrias, and the detailed work which has been carried out by Waagen and\r\nothers amongst the rocks of the Salt Range must make this, for the\r\npresent at all events, the type area for the marine development of the\r\nstrata of Permo-Carboniferous and Permian ages.\r\n\r\n_The Permian flora and fauna._ The Permian flora presents some\r\ndifficulties. The flora of the Zechstein consists largely of ferns and\r\nconifers, but that of the Rothliegende of Germany has been compared\r\nwith that of the Carboniferous, and if a true Permian flora of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere has many forms of Carboniferous affinities, the\r\npresence of the Glossopteris flora in Permo-Carboniferous rocks of\r\nmore southerly regions seems to imply its origin there and _slow_\r\nmigration northwards. It must be noted, however, that the Rothliegende\r\nhas been divided by some geologists into an upper and lower division,\r\nof which the lower is actually referred to the Carboniferous system.\r\nAll that can be now said is, that our knowledge of the floras of\r\nPermo-Carboniferous and Permian times is still incomplete, and that\r\nthe difficulties will no doubt be cleared up as the result of further\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe invertebrate fauna of the north-west European Permian deposits is\r\nchiefly noticeable on account of the paucity of species, though\r\nindividuals are often abundant. The shells are also sometimes stunted\r\nand occasionally distorted. These characters bear out the supposition\r\nthat the aqueous deposits were laid down in inland seas of Caspian\r\ncharacter and not in the open ocean. Polyzoa, brachiopods, and\r\nlamellibranchs predominate, but other groups are found. The\r\nvertebrates consist of forms of fish, amphibia and reptiles, and the\r\nPermian rocks are the earliest strata in which the remains of true\r\nReptilia are known to occur with certainty. The Reptiles belong to the\r\norders Anomodontia (Theromora) and Rhynchocephalia, of which the\r\nformer is exclusively Permian and Triassic, while the latter is\r\nabundant in the strata of those periods, but is represented at the\r\npresent day by the genus _Sphenodon_ of New Zealand. The Amphibia\r\nbelong to the order Labyrinthodontia which ranges from Carboniferous\r\nto Lower Jurassic, but the members of the order are most abundant in\r\nPermian and Triassic strata, and these periods may be spoken of as the\r\nPeriods of Labyrinthodonts.\r\n\r\nA few words must be said of the fauna of the truly marine Permian\r\nbeds. It is much richer than that of the abnormal deposits of\r\nnorth-western Europe, and its study is important as furnishing another\r\nlink between Palæozoic and Mesozoic life. Many Palæozoic genera pass\r\nup into the Permian rocks, and, as will be ultimately seen, several\r\noccur in those of the Triassic system, and one or two even in the\r\nbasal Jurassic strata, though Mesozoic forms predominate in the Lower\r\nJurassic Rocks, and there is a fairly equal admixture of forms usually\r\nconsidered as Palæozoic and of those generally regarded as Mesozoic in\r\nTriassic rocks, while the Palæozoic forms still predominate over the\r\nMesozoic in the Permian strata. Along with these characteristic\r\nPalæozoic genera, it is interesting to find representatives of more\r\nthan one genus of the tribe of Ammonites, which is to take so\r\nprominent a place in the fauna of the Mesozoic rocks, amongst the true\r\nmarine Permian sediments of India and other areas. The announcement of\r\nthe contemporaneity of ammonites with fossils regarded as exclusively\r\npalæozoic was received with considerable doubt, but this\r\ncontemporaneity is now clearly established, and need not be regarded\r\nas in any way anomalous.\r\n\r\nWith the deposition of the Permian rocks, Palæozoic time comes to an\r\nend, but as already remarked there is no marked and sudden change to\r\ncharacterise it. Had our classification been originally founded on\r\nstudy of the Indian Rocks instead of those of Britain, and similar\r\nterms adopted, the line of demarcation between Palæozoic and Mesozoic\r\nrocks would probably have been drawn below the Permo-Carboniferous\r\ndeposits, and if it had been based on study of other areas, perhaps\r\nelsewhere. The palæontological break is purely local, and it is of the\r\nutmost importance that it should be recognised as such, and that it\r\nshould not be considered that division into Palæozoic and Mesozoic\r\nimplies some great and widespread change which occurred between the\r\ntimes covered by the deposits of each of these great divisions[97].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: The Permian Fossils of Britain are described by\r\nProfessor King in the Monographs of the Palæontographical Society (the\r\nBrachiopods by Dr Davidson in the Monographs of the same Society). For\r\na general account of the marine type the student may consult the\r\nsecond edition of Messrs Medlicott and Blanford's _Geology of India_.\r\nFor information concerning the Permian volcanic rocks see Sir A.\r\nGeikie's _Ancient Volcanoes of Great Britain_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIASSIC SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification._ The term Triassic has been applied to these rocks on\r\naccount of the threefold division into which those of Germany\r\nnaturally fall. These three divisions are:--\r\n\r\n    Keuper,\r\n    Muschelkalk,\r\n    Bunter;\r\n\r\nbut above the Keuper beds we find a group of deposits of some\r\nimportance, which shew affinities with both Triassic and Jurassic\r\nrocks, which may be looked upon as true passage beds, though they are\r\ngenerally placed in the Triassic System. They are known as Rhætic or\r\nlocally in Britain as Penarth Beds. The Muschelkalk is usually\r\nconsidered to be unrepresented in Britain, and accordingly the British\r\ndeposits may be, and are usually grouped as under:--\r\n\r\n  Rhætic or Penarth beds\r\n  Keuper                  { Keuper Marls\r\n                          { Keuper Sandstones\r\n  [Muschelkalk] absent\r\n                          { Upper Red and Mottled Sandstones\r\n  Bunter                  { Bunter Pebble Beds\r\n                          { Lower Red and Mottled Sandstones.\r\n\r\nThe threefold grouping has been applied more or less universally, but\r\nwhen used outside the north-west European area, it loses its\r\nsignificance, as the conditions which enable one to differentiate the\r\nrocks of the three divisions were naturally only prevalent over a\r\nlimited area.\r\n\r\n_Description of the strata._ The British Triassic rocks possess a\r\ncertain sameness as regards their general characters, consisting\r\nmainly of mechanical sediments coloured red by peroxide of iron, with\r\noccasional chemical precipitates of rock-salt and gypsum. They have a\r\nwider distribution over Britain than have the Permian rocks, and the\r\nlithological characters of the different subdivisions do not as a rule\r\nvary to a remarkable degree when traced laterally. The differences in\r\ndetail in the characters of the various deposits are noteworthy, and\r\nan explanation of the exact origin of some of these abnormal deposits\r\nwhich will satisfy everyone is not yet forthcoming. Leaving the\r\ndetails out of consideration for the moment, and looking at the\r\ngeneral aspect of the deposits, the prevalence of conditions generally\r\nsimilar to those which existed over the British Isles in the preceding\r\nPermian period is decidedly indicated by the nature of the strata,\r\nthough the continental conditions appear to have been more widely\r\nestablished over our area, as shewn by the general absence of any\r\ncalcareous deposits resembling the Magnesian Limestone. We find\r\nchemical precipitates, millet-seed sandstones, and scree-like breccias\r\nin the British Triassic rocks as well as in those of Permian age, and\r\nthe paucity of a marine invertebrate fauna in the Triassic rocks of\r\nBritain is even more apparent than in the Permian strata. It is only\r\nat the extreme close of the Triassic period, during the deposition of\r\nthe rocks which are admitted on all hands to be of Rhætic age, that\r\nwe note the incoming of those marine conditions over our area, which\r\nprevailed so extensively, with few local exceptions, during the\r\nremainder of the Mesozoic and the early part of Tertiary times; the\r\nRhætic beds, in fact, mark the commencement of the third marine\r\nperiod. Referring to the strata in further detail, we may proceed to\r\nconsider the character of the different subdivisions in the order of\r\ntheir formation, commencing as usual with the oldest. The Bunter\r\ndeposits rest in places upon those of Permian age with an unconformity\r\nat the junction, but as these unconformities occur frequently among\r\nthe British Triassic rocks, it is doubtful whether this unconformity\r\nmarks more than very local change of physical conditions. The lower\r\nand upper divisions of the Bunter sandstone consist of false-bedded\r\nred and variegated sandstones, and there is no great difficulty in\r\nexplaining their formation in desert areas with tracts of water, but\r\nthe great change which marks the appearance and disappearance of the\r\nmiddle division, the Bunter pebble beds, requires some explanation,\r\nfor the contrast between the lithological characters of the rocks of\r\nthis division and those of the rocks appertaining to the preceding and\r\nsucceeding division is very marked. The matrix differs, but the main\r\ndifference is the abundance of pebbles, mostly of fairly uniform size,\r\nwell rounded, and largely consisting of liver-coloured quartzite. Much\r\ndifference of opinion exists as to the exact origin of these pebble\r\nbeds, and the source of the pebbles, but without entering into this\r\nvexed question, it may be remarked that the agency of rivers has been\r\nsomewhat generally invoked to account for their transport, and the\r\nconditions during their accumulation need not have been very different\r\nfrom those which are now found in northern India where the torrential\r\nrivers of the south side of the Himalayan chains debouch upon the\r\nplain, and spread an abundant deposit of well-worn pebbles over the\r\nfiner silts which were previously laid down thereon.\r\n\r\nThe junction of the Bunter and Keuper beds requires a short notice. It\r\nis usually if not always an unconformable one in Britain, and it is\r\ngenerally assumed that the absence of the Muschelkalk of the Continent\r\nis due to the presence of land undergoing denudation in Britain during\r\nthe time when the Muschelkalk was elsewhere deposited, though it is\r\nquite possible that the Muschelkalk epoch is represented in Britain\r\nnot only by the time which elapsed when the unconformity was being\r\nimpressed on the rocks, but also during the true deposition of the\r\nupper part of the Bunter beds, or the lower part of the Keuper, or\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nThe Keuper sandstones and marls contain a great development of\r\nchemical deposits, of millet-seed sands, and of many other features\r\npointing to desert conditions, such as sun-cracks, tracks of animals\r\nimpressed upon a rapidly drying surface, and pseudomorphs of mud after\r\nrock salt in the form of cubes and hopper-crystals; furthermore we\r\nfind the scree-like breccias at different horizons of the Keuper beds\r\nwhere they abut against the old Mendip ridge composed largely of\r\nmountain-limestone which furnished the fragments, as was the case with\r\nthe brockrams abutting against the Pennine ridge. It must be noted\r\nthat the chemical precipitates of Triassic age consist of the less\r\nsoluble substances dissolved in ocean water, namely, gypsum and rock\r\nsalt, whilst the more deliquescent potash and magnesia salts are not\r\nrepresented in Britain.\r\n\r\nTurning to these continental beds, we get evidence of a general\r\napproach to open sea conditions as we pass away from Britain in a\r\nsouth-easterly direction as roughly shewn in the following diagram\r\n(fig. 22), where _B_ represents the Bunter beds, _M_ the Muschelkalk,\r\nand _K_ the Keuper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the mechanical sediments gradually die out and\r\nbecome replaced by calcareous material as one passes from Britain\r\ntowards Switzerland; the Muschelkalk is very thin in the east of\r\nFrance and thickens out in Germany, while in Switzerland Keuper,\r\nMuschelkalk and Bunter are alike largely represented by calcareous\r\ndeposits, and the mechanical deposits are chiefly argillaceous, the\r\nonly important sandstone being situated at the extreme base of the\r\nBunter series.\r\n\r\nThe marine development of the Triassic system is naturally the one\r\nwhich is most widely spread, though full appreciation of its\r\nimportance has only taken place as the result of researches in distant\r\nclimes of recent years. It is found in southern Europe, in\r\nSpitsbergen, in considerable tracts of Asia, including India, and\r\nalong the Pacific coast region of North America, and everywhere\r\npossesses much the same characters.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above remarks that the physical conditions\r\nwhich prevailed in the continental area of Triassic times which is now\r\npartly occupied by the British Isles are most closely represented by\r\nthose of the desert regions of central Asia, hemmed in by the\r\nmountain ranges which intercept the vapour-laden winds of the oceans,\r\nand cause them to precipitate the great bulk of their vapour on the\r\nseaward slopes of the mountains, so that they blow over the deserts as\r\ndry winds, causing the fall of any large amount of rain to be a rare\r\nthough by no means unknown event in the desert regions.\r\n\r\n_Flora and Fauna of the Period._ The Triassic flora is essentially\r\nsimilar to that of the higher Permian strata, though many of the\r\ngenera are different.\r\n\r\nThe invertebrate fauna of the British deposits is, as might be\r\nexpected, very poor until the beds of the Rhætic series are reached.\r\nIn the beds below the Rhætics, the principal invertebrate remains are\r\nthe tests of the crustacean genus _Estheria_, though a few obscure\r\nlamellibranch shells have been recorded. The vertebrate fauna is of\r\ngreat interest. A number of fishes have been found, the most\r\nremarkable of which is the genus _Ceratodus_, occurring in the Rhætic\r\nbeds of Britain and lower Triassic strata of foreign countries. It is\r\nclosely related to the Barramunda of the Queensland rivers belonging\r\nto the order Dipnoi. As in the Permian strata, abundance of\r\nLabyrinthodont amphibians have been discovered, and the reptiles\r\nbelong to the orders Anomodontia and Rhynchocephalia. In the Rhætic\r\nbeds of Britain and in still lower Triassic beds abroad the orders\r\nIchthyopterygia and Sauropterygia (represented by _Ichthyosaurus_ and\r\n_Plesiosaurus_) are found.\r\n\r\nThe Triassic rocks also yield the earliest known mammals, the best\r\nknown, _Microlestes_, occurring in the Triassic rocks of Britain and\r\nthe Continent. These mammals are now placed in a subclass Metatheria\r\nof the order Monotremata.\r\n\r\nThe marine invertebrate fauna of the normal Triassic rocks presents\r\nsome points of considerable interest. As already remarked, the fauna\r\nmay be looked upon as a passage fauna between that of Palæozoic and\r\nthat of Mesozoic times, the number of Palæozoic forms which pass into\r\nthe Trias being approximately comparable with those which appear here\r\nand range upwards into higher Mesozoic strata. This may be well seen\r\nby examining the table given in Chapter XXI. of the Second Edition of\r\nSir Charles Lyell's _Student's Elements of Geology_, in which three\r\ncolumns shew the genera of Mollusca common to older rocks, those\r\ncharacteristic of the Trias, and those common to newer rocks. Amongst\r\nthe first are _Orthoceras_, _Bactrites_, _Loxonema_, _Murchisonia_,\r\nand _Euomphalus_, in the second column are _Ceratites_, _Halobia_\r\n(_Daonella_), _Koninckina_, and _Myophoria_, and in the third,\r\nAmmonites, _Cerithium_, _Opis_, _Plicatula_ and _Thecidium_[98].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: It has been seen that some of the Ammonites appear\r\nearlier, namely, in Permian strata. _Myophoria_ is extremely abundant\r\nin the Trias, but ranges into newer strata.]\r\n\r\nThe Ammonites are largely utilised in the case of the Mesozoic strata\r\nfor separation of these strata into zones, each zone being\r\ncharacterised by some species of Ammonite, and the researches of\r\nMojsisovics have proved that this zonal subdivision, long adopted for\r\nJurassic rocks, is also applicable to those of Triassic age[99]. He\r\ngives the following table of the classification of the Triassic rocks\r\nof the Mediterranean Province, which is reproduced, as it is founded\r\nupon Palæontological evidence, and will probably be widely adopted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: von Mojsisovics, Dr E., \"Faunistische Ergebnisse aus der\r\nUntersuchung der Ammoneen-faunen der Mediterranen Trias.\" _Abhandl.\r\nder k. k.

They are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                 { Purbeckian\r\n  Upper Oolites  { Portlandian\r\n                 { Kimmeridgian\r\n\r\n                 { Corallian\r\n  Middle Oolites { Oxfordian\r\n                 { Callovian\r\n\r\n  Lower Oolites  { Bathonian\r\n                 { Bajocian\r\n\r\n                 { Toarcian\r\n  Lias           { Liassian\r\n                 { Sinemurian.\r\n\r\nMany of these series have been still farther subdivided into smaller\r\nstages, and the whole differentiated into a number of zones\r\ncharacterised by different forms of Ammonites. Dr E. von Mojsisovics\r\ngives thirty-two Ammonite zones, of which fourteen occur in the Lias,\r\neight in the Lower Oolites, six in the Middle Oolites, and four in the\r\nUpper Oolites.\r\n\r\n_Characters of the strata._ The whole of the Jurassic rocks and also\r\nthose of Lower Cretaceous age may be regarded as having been deposited\r\nduring the first shallow water phase of the third marine period, but\r\nthis shallow water phase is represented by strata which are varied\r\nowing to numerous marine changes resulting in the production of land\r\nat times, and estuarine conditions, shallow water, marine conditions,\r\nand somewhat deeper sea conditions respectively at other times, and\r\naccordingly the strata of the British Isles vary greatly when traced\r\nlaterally. That the uplifts of the Permo-Triassic periods produced\r\nsome effect on the nature and distribution of the Jurassic rocks is\r\ncertain, but it is not quite clear how far the ridges produced by\r\nthese uplifts were submerged and denuded during the deposition of the\r\nmain portion of the Jurassic strata.\r\n\r\nViewed broadly, the Jurassic rocks of Britain may be regarded as\r\nconsisting of three great clay deposits, the Lias, Oxford and\r\nKimmeridge Clays, alternating with the deposits of variable\r\nlithological characters, which compose the Bajocian, Bathonian,\r\nCorallian, Portlandian and Purbeckian subdivisions. This essentially\r\nargillaceous character of a large part of the deposits of Jurassic age\r\nis often overlooked, as, owing to their sameness and the comparative\r\npaucity of organisms constituting the faunas in the clays, their\r\ndescription in text-books can be given at much shorter length than\r\nthat of the more variable and highly fossiliferous deposits which\r\nseparate the clays. The following figure (Fig. 23) roughly represents\r\nthe nature of the different divisions of the rocks of this system when\r\ntraced across England from south-west to north-east.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.\r\n\r\nVertical scale: 1 in. = about 1000 feet.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the greatest variations in lithological character\r\noccur in the Bathonian and Bajocian beds, and it will be of interest\r\nto give some account of the principal variations and to attempt to\r\naccount for them. In so doing it will be convenient to consider the\r\nfour major divisions of the Jurassic rocks separately, and to enter\r\ninto particulars concerning the local classification applied to the\r\nrocks of these divisions.\r\n\r\n_The Lias._ The British Lias deposits are divided into the Lower Lias,\r\nthe Marlstone, and the Upper Lias corresponding in general terms only\r\nwith the Sinemurian, Liassian, and Toarcian. The Marlstone is\r\nseparated from the Upper and Lower Lias on account of the greater\r\npercentage of carbonate of lime which it contains, so that the bands\r\nof argillaceous limestone are much more marked in the Marlstone than\r\nin the upper and lower divisions, which consist chiefly of clay. The\r\nthree divisions possess very much the same characters throughout the\r\ncountry, though the presence of the Mendip ridge and its continuation\r\nbeneath London is marked by the attenuation of this and succeeding\r\nstrata, and by the conglomeratic character of some of the Liassic\r\nstrata where they abut against it. The British Lias, as a whole, seems\r\nto have been deposited in a fairly shallow sea at no great distance\r\nfrom the land. It passes down conformably into the Rhætic beds, indeed\r\nthe zone of Ammonites (_Aegoceras_) _planorbis_, referred by British\r\ngeologists to the Lower Lias is included by some continental writers\r\nwith the Rhætic beds, and the plane of demarcation here as in other\r\ncases is conventional.\r\n\r\n_The Lower Oolites._ Of all the British strata, these perhaps cause\r\nmost trouble to the learner, on account of the different nomenclature\r\napplied to the rocks in different parts of England, and the rapid\r\nvariations in lithological character, when the beds are traced\r\nlaterally. The following divisions are usually adopted for the beds of\r\nthe south-western counties where the most marked marine development\r\noccurs:--\r\n\r\n    Cornbrash,\r\n    Forest Marble,\r\n    Great Oolite (with Bradford Clay),\r\n    Fuller's Earth,\r\n    Inferior Oolite.\r\n\r\nOf these divisions, the uppermost one, the Cornbrash, though thin,\r\nretains its characters with great constancy across the island. Of the\r\nothers the Forest Marble may be looked upon as a local development of\r\nthe upper portion of the Great Oolite, and the Fuller's Earth is a\r\nlocal deposit, so that the Inferior Oolite and Great Oolite constitute\r\nthe important divisions of the Lower Oolites. The variations in the\r\ncharacters of the rocks may be best shown in tabular form.\r\n\r\n -----------------+------------------+-------------------+-----------------\r\n Gloucestershire, |      South       |        N.         |\r\n       &c.        | Northamptonshire | Northamptonshire  |    Yorkshire\r\n                  |                  |    and Lincoln    |\r\n -----------------+------------------+-------------------+-----------------\r\n     Cornbrash    |    Cornbrash     |     Cornbrash     |    Cornbrash\r\n -----------------+------------------+-------------------+-----------------\r\n Great Oolite     | Great Oolite     | Great Oolite Clay |\r\n                  | (Upper part)     | Great Oolite      | Upper\r\n                  |                  |   Limestone       |\r\n                  |                  | Upper             | Estuarine\r\n                  | Northamptonshire | Estuarine         |\r\n  ............... | ................ | ................. | ................\r\n                  |                  | Series            |   Series\r\n                  |                  | Lincolnshire      | Scarbro'\r\n                  |                  |   Limestone       |   Limestone\r\n                  | Sands            |                   | Middle Estuarine\r\n                  |                  |                   |   Series\r\n Inferior Oolite  |                  | Lower Estuarine   | Millepore Oolite\r\n                  |                  |   Series          |\r\n                  |                  |                   | Lower Estuarine\r\n                  |                  |                   |   Series\r\n -----------------+------------------+-------------------+-----------------\r\n    Upper Lias    |    Upper Lias    |     Upper Lias    |    Upper Lias\r\n -----------------+------------------+-------------------+-----------------\r\n\r\n     The dotted line shows roughly the division between Bathonian\r\n     and Bajocian.\r\n\r\nThe changes may be explained very simply if we leave out of account\r\nfor the moment the development of Lincolnshire Limestone, with its\r\nequivalent the Scarbro' Limestone, and the Millepore series. The beds\r\nin Gloucestershire and other south-western counties are essentially\r\nmarine; whilst in Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire estuarine\r\nconditions set in after the deposition of the Upper Lias, and\r\ncontinued throughout the deposition of the Bajocian and Lower\r\nBathonian beds, being replaced by marine conditions during the\r\nformation of the Upper Bathonian strata, and still further north in\r\nYorkshire the estuarine conditions generally prevailed throughout\r\nBajocian and Bathonian times. These changes point to the existence of\r\nland towards the north. The general simplicity is modified by\r\ntemporary prevalence of marine conditions twice over (during the\r\ndeposition of the Millepore Oolite and the Scarbro' Limestone) in\r\nYorkshire, and once (during the deposition of the Lincolnshire\r\nLimestone) in Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\nCertain local deposits have not been noticed, but two of them merit\r\nbrief reference. At the base of the Great Oolite of Oxfordshire is an\r\nestuarine deposit of finely laminated mechanical sediment mixed with\r\ncalcareous matter known as the Stonesfield Slate, especially\r\ninteresting on account of its fossils, while a bed with similar\r\nlithological characters but with a different fauna occurring at the\r\nbase of the Lincolnshire Limestone (of Bajocian age) is termed the\r\nCollyweston Slate. Neither of these deposits is a slate in the true\r\nsense of the word, as they have not been affected by cleavage\r\nsubsequently to their accumulation, but each has been somewhat\r\nextensively used for roofing purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Oolites are much less complicated though considerable\r\nvariations arise with respect to the Corallian Rocks. The Oxfordian\r\nwith Callovian consist chiefly of clay, though the Callovian of the\r\nsouth of England is represented by calcareous sandstone, with a\r\npeculiar fauna which seems to be represented in the lower part of the\r\nOxford Clay further north, though this Callovian fauna has not been\r\neverywhere recognised.\r\n\r\nThe Corallian of the southern counties consists of limestones with\r\ncalcareous grits, the limestones being often largely composed of the\r\nremains of reef-building corals, and a similar development of the\r\nrocks of this series is found in Yorkshire, while a local development\r\nof the same character is found at Upware in Cambridgeshire, though in\r\nthe other parts of the Fenland counties the Corallian is represented\r\nby an argillaceous deposit with Corallian fossils known as the\r\nAmpthill Clay.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Oolites have a tolerably constant base, the Kimmeridge Clay,\r\nusually consisting of laminated bituminous argillaceous material, but\r\nthe Portlandian and Purbeckian divisions vary greatly, and are only\r\nlocally developed, though their absence in some parts of central\r\nEngland is no doubt due to unconformity.\r\n\r\nThe Portlandian rocks of the south of England consist of limestones\r\nand sandstones which pass further northward into shallower water\r\nmechanical deposits often charged with iron hydrate, and the beds\r\ndisappear in Oxfordshire. The Purbeckian rocks of the south are also\r\nlimited as regards area of exposure: they consist of estuarine\r\ndeposits with some terrestrial accumulations of the nature of old\r\nsurface soils. Representations of the Portlandian and Purbeckian beds\r\nare found in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, as arenaceous deposits in the\r\nformer county and argillaceous ones in the latter. Both are marine\r\ndeposits of a northern type, developed elsewhere in northern European\r\nand circumpolar regions, and in these counties we find a complete\r\npassage from the Jurassic rocks through the Cretaceous rocks, but the\r\nexact lines of demarcation between the different series of the passage\r\nbeds are difficult to define.\r\n\r\nThe foreign Jurassic rocks of Europe and of some parts of Asia\r\nstrongly resemble in general characters those which have been\r\ndescribed above as occurring in Britain. One of the most remarkable\r\nfeatures of the Jurassic rocks as a whole, is the absence of the Lias\r\nover wide areas, the continental period which in Britain existed in\r\nPermo-Triassic times is elsewhere frequently replaced by one of\r\nLiassic age.\r\n\r\nThe Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks are of interest on account of the\r\nevidence which they supply as to the existence of climatic zones in\r\nthese periods, which run fairly parallel with those at present\r\nexisting. The late Dr Neumayr in a paper already cited divides the\r\nworld during later Mesozoic times into four distinct climatic zones,\r\nequatorial, north and south temperate and boreal zones (the\r\ncorresponding austral zone is not known owing no doubt to the\r\nextensive sea of South Polar regions and our general ignorance of its\r\nlands). In Europe the Mediterranean Province belongs to the equatorial\r\nzone, the Middle European to the North temperate zone, and the Russian\r\nor Boreal to the Boreal zone. The last-named is marked partly by\r\nnegative characters, the absence of certain Ammonite-genera and of\r\ncoral reefs being noticeable, whilst the lamellibranch _Aucella_ is\r\nvery frequent. In the North temperate zone, certain Ammonite genera as\r\n_Aspidoceras_ and _Oppelia_ are abundant and there are also extensive\r\ncoral-reefs. The Equatorial zone is marked by the Ammonite-genera\r\n_Phylloceras_ and _Lytoceras_ and by the _Diphya_ group of\r\n_Terebratulæ_. It is of special interest to note that the fauna of the\r\nSouth temperate bears closer relationship to that of the North\r\ntemperate than to that of the intermediate Equatorial zone.\r\n\r\n_Jurassic floras and faunas._ The Jurassic flora is very similar in\r\nits characters to that of the Lower Cretaceous rocks, and the two\r\ntaken together afford a decided contrast with that of later Palæozoic\r\ntimes, and also with that which succeeds them in the Upper Cretaceous\r\nrocks, which bears a marked resemblance to the existing flora. Cycads\r\npredominate, accompanied by conifers, and a fair number of ferns and\r\nEquisetaceæ.\r\n\r\nThe Jurassic fauna is specially noteworthy on account of the character\r\nof the vertebrata, but some notice of the invertebrates must also be\r\ntaken. The abundance of corals in the Temperate zones has already been\r\npointed out, but the mollusca form the bulk of the invertebrate fauna,\r\nlamellibranchs, gastropods and cephalopods being all abundant; of the\r\nlast-named the ammonites and belemnites contribute most largely. The\r\nvertebrates include remains of fishes, amphibia, reptiles, birds and\r\nmammals. The Jurassic reptilia furnish representatives of some modern\r\norders as the Chelonia and Crocodilia, but the most important orders\r\nare essentially characteristic of later Mesozoic times and their\r\nrepresentatives abound in the Jurassic strata. These are the\r\nSauropterygia (including the Plesiosaurs), the Ichthyopterygia\r\n(including the Ichthyosaurs), the Dinosauria, and the Pterosauria\r\ncommonly known as Pterodactyls. No birds have hitherto been discovered\r\nin the British Jurassic rocks, but the Solenhofen Slate of Bavaria (of\r\nKimmeridgian age) has furnished the celebrated _Archæopteryx\r\nmacrura_, which is not only placed in a family but also in an order by\r\nitself, the order Saururæ. Many remains of mammals have been extracted\r\nfrom the estuarine deposits of Stonesfield, and the old surface soils\r\nof the Purbeckian beds; representatives of the Monotremata are\r\nfurnished by the _Plagiaulacidæ_ and _Tritylodontidæ_, the former\r\nfamily containing the genus _Plagiaulax_ of the Purbeck Beds and the\r\nlatter, _Stereognathus_ of the Stonesfield slate. The Marsupialia are\r\nrepresented by the _Amphitheridæ_, _Spalacotheridæ_ and\r\n_Triconodontidæ_. Some forms have been referred to the Insectivora,\r\nbut there is still disagreement concerning the correctness of this\r\nreference.\r\n\r\nBefore dismissing the subject of the Jurassic fossils, attention may\r\nbe called to a feature which has been frequently commented upon,\r\nnamely, the general resemblance of the flora and fauna of Jurassic\r\ntimes to the modern Australian fauna and flora. The explanation which\r\nhas been offered to account for this resemblance has been given in a\r\npreceding chapter, where it was stated that Mr A. R. Wallace\r\nconsiders, after review of the geological and biological evidence,\r\nthat Australia was severed from the adjoining continental lands in\r\nMesozoic times, and that the higher forms of life which on the larger\r\ncontinents have replaced the earlier and lower forms have not\r\nsucceeded in obtaining a footing in Australia, which therefore\r\nfurnishes us with a local survival of a once widespread fauna. In\r\nconnection with this matter the actual existence of the genus\r\n_Trigonia_ (a form peculiarly abundant in Jurassic strata and\r\ncharacteristic of Mesozoic strata in Britain) in the Australian sea is\r\nof considerable interest.[100]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: A good account of the British Jurassic rocks will be\r\nfound in Mr H. B. Woodward's Memoir on \"The Jurassic Rocks of\r\nBritain.\" _Mem. Geol. Survey_, 1893--.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CRETACEOUS SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification._ The rocks of the Cretaceous system are conveniently\r\ndivided into Upper and Lower Cretaceous. The following classification\r\nhas been widely used for the British deposits, and is founded on\r\nlithological characters:\r\n\r\n             { Upper Chalk with flints      }\r\n             { Middle Chalk with few flints } Chalk\r\n  Upper      { Lower Chalk without flints   }\r\n  Cretaceous { Chalk Marl                   }\r\n             { Upper Greensand\r\n             { Gault\r\n\r\n             { Lower Greensand\r\n  Lower      { Wealden\r\n  Cretaceous { Hastings sands\r\n\r\nAs the result of examination of the faunas, a more generally\r\napplicable classification has been established and is now largely\r\nadopted. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Danian     }\r\n  Senonian   } Upper Cretaceous\r\n  Turonian   }\r\n  Cenomanian }\r\n\r\n  Albian     }\r\n  Aptian     }Lower Cretaceous.\r\n  Neocomian  }\r\n\r\nIn this classification the Neocomian practically represents the\r\nWealden and Hastings beds, the Aptian the Lower Greensand and the\r\nAlbian the Gault, placed according to this classification in the Lower\r\nCretaceous, while the Upper divisions represent the strata above the\r\nGault, consisting essentially of Chalk in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Description of the Strata._\r\n\r\n(i) _The Neocomian and Aptian Beds._ In the south of England the Lower\r\nCretaceous beds succeed the Jurassic rocks with little or no break,\r\nand the type of the lower beds is similar to that of the beds\r\ndeposited during the Purbeck age, consisting of estuarine deposits of\r\nvariable characters, chiefly arenaceous below (the Hastings sands) and\r\nargillaceous above (the Wealden series), though impure limestones are\r\nfound, largely composed of the shells of the freshwater _Paludina_,\r\nand much ironstone is developed in places. At the close of Neocomian\r\ntimes, the freshwater conditions in southern England were replaced by\r\nmarine conditions and the Lower Greensand strata with their marine\r\nfauna were deposited in the Aptian sea. The Neocomian and Aptian beds\r\nthin out westward, and much more rapidly to the northward, so that\r\nboth divisions disappear against the now buried ridge which forms a\r\ncontinuation of the Mendip axis. North of this they appear in another\r\nform. At first the highest Aptian beds alone are developed as shore\r\ndeposits. Passing into Norfolk lower beds come in until in\r\nLincolnshire we get a complete development of the Neocomian and Aptian\r\nbeds with a marine facies, though of fairly shallow water character,\r\nwhilst in Yorkshire the two divisions are represented by a deeper\r\nwater clay, forming the Upper portion of the Speeton series. There is\r\na consensus of opinion in favour of the Neocomian beds of southern\r\nBritain having been laid down in an estuary of a river flowing from\r\nthe west over a continent now destroyed. To the north of this river\r\nstood the London ridge of the Palæozoic rocks, the northern borders of\r\nwhich formed the coast line off which were deposited the sediments of\r\nNeocomian and Aptian ages which occur in northern England. Before the\r\ndeposition of the Albian beds a considerable upheaval of some parts of\r\nBritain occurred, and an unconformity separates the higher Cretaceous\r\nbeds from older strata of Cretaceous and Jurassic ages, thus\r\ncomplicating the major phases by local changes in the characters of\r\nthe strata.\r\n\r\n(ii) _The Albian and higher Cretaceous Beds._ The commencement of the\r\ndeep-water phase of the third marine period may be said to occur in\r\nAlbian times in Britain, reaching its maximum during the deposition of\r\nthe chalk. The existence of a deeper sea towards the north of England\r\nis indicated by the characters of the Albian and newer strata. The\r\nAlbian beds of gault consist of a stiff clay in southern England,\r\nreplaced by coarser mechanical sediments towards the west. As one\r\npasses north from the London ridge (which exerted its influence in\r\nAlbian times, after which it was finally buried in sediment) the gault\r\nthins out, and becomes gradually replaced by calcareous deposit when\r\nit is known as the red chalk which replaces the gault in northern\r\nNorfolk, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nA local unconformity separating the chalk and gault in parts of East\r\nAnglia points to another local uplift with its accompanying\r\ncomplications in the characters of the strata. After the uplift had\r\nceased, general depression must have occurred, and the various\r\ndivisions of the chalk were accumulated in a fairly open sea, though,\r\nfor reasons to be given presently, this was probably of no great\r\nlateral extent, save when united with the open ocean, probably in a\r\nmanner similar to the connexion between the Gulf of Mexico and the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nThe general variations in the lithological characters of the various\r\nmembers of the Cretaceous system will probably be rendered clearer by\r\nreference to the accompanying diagram (fig. 24) representing the\r\nvariations when traced across England from south to north[101].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: For information concerning the British Cretaceous beds,\r\nsee Topley and Foster, \"Geology of the Weald,\" _Mem.

Jurassic.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe clue to the physical geography of Britain during Cretaceous times\r\nis furnished to a considerable extent by study of the foreign\r\ndeposits. In Northern Europe the Cretaceous beds of England are met\r\nwith in Northern France, and there the characters are generally\r\nspeaking similar to those of our British deposits. In Germany\r\nshallower water conditions prevailed, the lower beds gradually\r\ndisappear, and the upper beds are replaced by mechanical sediments of\r\nvarious degrees of coarseness, becoming on the whole coarser, as one\r\ntravels eastward, so that in Saxony the chalk is partly replaced by\r\narenaceous deposits (the 'Quader' sandstones) which are responsible\r\nfor the remarkable scenery of the Elbe district above Dresden. In\r\npassing northwards, indications of similar change are noted in the\r\ndeposits of Denmark and Scania, whilst to the south, we get a complete\r\nchange in the character of the rocks, after crossing the Loire in\r\nFrance, and a similar change is observable in districts lying further\r\neast. Furthermore, as will be noted more fully in a subsequent\r\nparagraph, the character of the Upper Cretaceous flora indicates the\r\nexistence of a large tract of land lying to the north and north-west\r\nof Europe, so that it would appear that the Cretaceous rocks of\r\nNorthern Europe were deposited in a gulf-like expansion of a western\r\nocean, bounded on the north by Scandinavia, on the west by eastern\r\nGermany, and on the south by a ridge running eastward from the mouth\r\nof the Loire[102]. We may speak of this gulf as the Chalk gulf. To the\r\nsouth of the presumed ridge the character of the strata alters, and\r\nalso that of the included organisms. This southern type of Cretaceous\r\nrocks is one which is very widely spread, being found in Europe south\r\nof the Loire, and of the Alps, and in Greece and Turkey, while it\r\nalso occurs in the northern parts of Africa. The beds of this type are\r\ntraceable through Asia Minor into India and to the shores of the\r\nIndian Ocean, indicating the existence of a widespread Cretaceous\r\nocean, which is sometimes spoken of as the Hippurite-limestone sea,\r\nfor reasons which will eventually appear. The deposits are largely\r\nformed of hard limestone which is very different in its character from\r\nthe soft chalk of the northern gulf.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: The reader will find the existence of this gulf\r\nmaintained and supported by a considerable mass of detail in Mr A. R.\r\nWallace's _Island Life_.]\r\n\r\nThe climatic conditions which prevailed during Cretaceous times were\r\napparently similar in most respects to those of the preceding Jurassic\r\nperiod, and as already stated the climatic zones which Neumayr defined\r\nfor Jurassic times are also maintained by him to have existed during\r\nthe Cretaceous period. The existence of cold has sometimes been\r\ninferred from the presence of large foreign blocks in the chalk,\r\nespecially at its base, but if these are due to the transport, they\r\nmight well be caused by masses of floating ice, which are often found\r\nat considerable distances from the coast in temperate regions after\r\nthe break-up of the frost which succeeds an unusually hard winter. The\r\nflora and fauna are not suggestive of severe conditions.\r\n\r\n_The Cretaceous flora and fauna._ It has been noted in the last\r\nchapter that the gymnospermous flora of the Jurassic period, in which\r\ncycads form a considerable percentage of the whole flora, was\r\nprevalent in Lower Cretaceous times. In the Upper Cretaceous rocks\r\nthis flora is replaced by one which consists to a large extent of\r\ndicotyledonous angiosperms. These are found in the Upper Cretaceous\r\nrocks of Europe and North America, and as the researches of botanists\r\nindicate their origin in circumpolar regions, their arrival in Europe\r\nis an additional argument in favour of the existence of an extensive\r\nnorthern continent, sending a prolongation to the southward in eastern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe invertebrate fauna bears considerable resemblance to that of\r\nJurassic times, and many of the dominant Jurassic genera are also\r\nfound in Cretaceous rocks. A most interesting feature is connected\r\nwith the character and geographical distribution of the Ammonites. In\r\nEurope they are almost exclusively confined to the deposits of the\r\nnorthern gulf, and before their final disappearance they undergo many\r\nchanges of form. We find the discoid spiral shells of earlier times,\r\nbut these are accompanied by shells which are straight, curved,\r\nboat-shaped, and coiled into various helicoid spirals, sometimes\r\nhaving the whorls in contact, while at other times they are separate.\r\n\r\nIn the chalk of Britain gastropods are on the whole rare, and this\r\nfact serves to emphasize the palæontological break which occurs\r\nbetween the Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks; but when conditions were\r\nfavourable, as during the deposition of some of the strata of the\r\nMiddle Chalk, gastropods are abundant, and some are related to\r\nTertiary genera, so that we may assume that the palæontological break\r\nalluded to is exaggerated by the difference of conditions which\r\nprevailed during the deposition of the earliest Tertiary and latest\r\nCretaceous sediments.\r\n\r\nIn the Cretaceous deposits of the southern sea, where the Ammonite\r\ntribe is almost unknown, the remarkable family of the lamellibranchs\r\nknown as the Hippuritidæ furnish the dominant invertebrates of the\r\nperiod, and the representatives of this family are exceedingly scarce\r\namongst the Cretaceous strata of the northern gulf, though they are\r\nfound on two or three horizons.\r\n\r\nOf vertebrates, the most interesting are the reptiles. The families\r\nwhich predominate in Jurassic times have many representatives amongst\r\nthe Cretaceous strata also, but the order Squamata is represented by\r\nthe sub-order Pythonomorpha, which is characteristic of the Cretaceous\r\nrocks. The best known representative is the gigantic _Mosasaurus_.\r\nLastly, we have the remarkable toothed birds or Odontornithes, now\r\nplaced in different orders, the genus _Hesperornis_ being the only\r\nrepresentative of the sub-order Odontolcæ of the Ratitæ, whilst\r\n_Ichthyornis_ and allied forms are placed in the sub-order Odontormæ\r\nof the Carinatæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE EOCENE ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification._ The Eocene Beds of the south of England have been\r\nsubdivided according to the variations in their lithological\r\ncharacters, and the subdivisions have received local names. The\r\nfollowing classification is generally adopted, though the different\r\nsubdivisions are by no means of equal value:\r\n\r\n  Upper Eocene  { Upper Bagshot Beds\r\n                { Barton Beds\r\n\r\n  Middle Eocene   Bracklesham Beds\r\n\r\n                { Lower Bagshot Beds\r\n                { London Clay[103]\r\n  Lower Eocene  { Oldhaven Beds             } Lower London\r\n                { Woolwich and Reading Beds } Tertiary Strata\r\n                { Thanet Sands              }\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: Some writers place the London Clay in the Middle\r\nEocene.]\r\n\r\nThe deposits vary greatly when traced abroad, and the exact\r\nequivalents of the minor subdivisions of the British rocks can seldom\r\nbe ascertained at any distance from England, though the division into\r\nUpper, Middle, and Lower Eocene can be made over wide areas.\r\n\r\n_Description of the strata._ The character of the strata of Europe and\r\nAsia indicates the persistence of the northern gulf and southern\r\nocean of Cretaceous times in Eocene times also, though the area of\r\neach had shrunk in the meantime, owing to the physiographical changes\r\nwhich occurred at the end of Cretaceous times, giving rise to more\r\nextended land areas, and producing a shallow water phase over wide\r\nextents of ocean,--the final shallow water phase of the third and last\r\ngreat marine period of the British area. It is difficult to ascertain\r\nthe exact importance of the physical break between Cretaceous and\r\nEocene rocks in the south-east of England, owing to the subterranean\r\nsolution of the upper part of the chalk, subsequently to the\r\ndeposition of the Eocene strata, but the contraction of the Cretaceous\r\ngulf is shown in several ways, one of the most significant being the\r\ndistribution of Cretaceous and Eocene rocks in the south-west of\r\nEngland. The existence of an outlier of Cretaceous rock at Buckland\r\nBrewer in North Devon, only three miles from the Atlantic Ocean,\r\nindicates the former extension westward of the Upper Cretaceous beds,\r\nwhile the occurrence of an outlier of Eocene rocks at Bovey Tracey in\r\nSouth Devon, resting not on Cretaceous but on Palæozoic rocks, shows\r\nthat there was an uplift after the deposition of the Cretaceous rocks\r\nand before the Eocene rocks were deposited there, and that during the\r\nperiod of uplift the Cretaceous rocks were removed.\r\n\r\nOwing to these physical changes, the Eocene rocks of Britain are\r\nmainly mechanical sediments, some, as the Oldhaven beds, being\r\ncomposed of coarse pebbles over a fairly wide district, while some of\r\nthe earlier Eocene rocks are estuarine or fluvio-marine.\r\n\r\nThe Eocene rocks of Britain occur in four areas, namely, the London\r\nBasin, the Hampshire Basin, the Bovey Tracey outlier, and the\r\nnorth-east of Ireland and western Isles of Scotland. The deposits of\r\nthe three southern areas may be considered together, and give general\r\nindications of an approach to land when passing westward. The Lower\r\nLondon Tertiary strata are fluvio-marine at the east end of the London\r\nBasin; they become shallower water deposits when traced westward, and\r\nbegin to disappear. The London Clay is an estuarine deposit, which is\r\ngenerally supposed to have been laid down at the mouth of a large\r\nriver flowing from the west. It is absent in the Bovey Tracey outlier.\r\n\r\nLocal disturbances caused the existence of a shallow water region in\r\nthe east during the deposition of the Middle and Upper Eocene\r\ndeposits, and accordingly the well-marked marine deposits which form\r\nthe representatives of these divisions in Hampshire are replaced by\r\nthe Bagshot beds of the London Basin, consisting chiefly of coarse\r\nmechanical sediments with a poor marine fauna, but even in the west\r\nshallow water prevailed at times during the accumulation of various\r\nplant-bearing strata. The Middle Eocene beds only are found in the\r\nBovey Tracey outlier, though the Upper Eocene beds may originally have\r\nbeen laid down in that area, and subsequently denuded.\r\n\r\nThe fourth area displays a very different succession of Eocene strata,\r\nand one of extreme interest. Mechanical sediments and plant-bearing\r\nclays and lignites alternate with a vast accumulation of basaltic\r\nlavas, indicating the outbreak of the volcanic forces in the British\r\narea, after a period of quiescence which lasted through the greater\r\npart of Mesozoic times. The region in which these lavas were poured\r\nout was probably a land area during the greater part of the period of\r\nvolcanic activity, but the horizontal lie of the lava flows and their\r\nwide extent indicate the existence of a flat tract of country,\r\ngradually raised into a plateau by the accumulation of sheet over\r\nsheet of basalt. How far this plateau extended it is impossible to\r\nsay. The distribution of the lavas at the present day is somewhat\r\nlimited in our isles, but there is no sign of dying out at the present\r\nmargins of the accumulations, and they have probably escaped\r\ndenudation in these regions, as maintained by Professor Judd, on\r\naccount of the faults which have depressed them, while the portions\r\nwhich were not depressed have been removed by denudation. Two views as\r\nto the origin of the lavas have been put forward: according to Prof.\r\nJudd, they were poured forth from gigantic volcanoes, while Sir A.\r\nGeikie maintains that they represent portions of massive or fissure\r\neruptions, the molten rock having welled out from great cracks in the\r\nearth, which are now filled by once molten rock in the form of dykes.\r\nAs these dykes extend far away from the present volcanic plateau, one\r\nactually extending to the Yorkshire coast, we may well believe,\r\nwhatever was the origin of the sheets of lava, that they were formerly\r\nspread far away from their present terminations[104]. Without entering\r\nhere into a discussion of the exact nature of extrusion of these\r\nigneous sheets, it will suffice to say that all the evidence points to\r\nthe formation of extensive plateaux, which must have presented a\r\nfairly uniform surface, similar to that which is still found\r\ncharacterising the volcanic districts of the western territories of\r\nNorth America.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: Prof. Judd's views will be found in a series of papers\r\nby him on the \"Secondary Rocks of Scotland,\" _Quart. Journ. Geol.\r\nSoc._, vol. XXIX. p. 95, XXX. p. 220, XXXIV. p. 660, while Sir A.\r\nGeikie's explanation is advanced in a paper in the _Transactions of\r\nthe Royal Society of Edinburgh_, vol. XXXV.; see also the same\r\nauthor's _Ancient Volcanoes of Great Britain_.]\r\n\r\nThe Eocene rocks of the north-west of Europe possess characters very\r\nsimilar to those of the south of England, and there are indications\r\nthat the northern gulf had diminished in extent towards the east as\r\nwell as towards the west.\r\n\r\nPassing to southern Europe, Central Asia and northern Africa, we find\r\nthe conditions of Cretaceous times reproduced, and an extensive series\r\nof marine deposits extends very widely over these regions, the most\r\npersistent deposit being a mass of limestone of Middle Eocene age,\r\nwhich is almost entirely composed of the tests of Nummulites, whence\r\nthe development is known as the Nummulitic Limestone facies, and we\r\nmay speak of the ocean as the Nummulitic Limestone Sea. The incoming\r\nof shallow water conditions marked by accumulation of coarse\r\nmechanical sediments towards the end of the Eocene period in some\r\nparts of the southern European area indicates the setting in, even\r\nthen, of those continental conditions which culminated during the\r\nMiocene period.\r\n\r\nIn North America we get similar evidence of the contractions of the\r\noceans which in Mesozoic times occupied large expanses of our present\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nThe climatic conditions of Eocene times have been noticed in passing\r\nin chapter IX., and evidence was given to prove the prevalence of a\r\nwarmer climate over the British area than that which now exists. A\r\nstudy of the floras of various parts of the northern hemisphere\r\nsuggests that climatic zones, whose lines of demarcation ran\r\npractically parallel with the Equator, existed in Eocene times also,\r\nthough further information upon this subject is desirable.\r\n\r\n_The Eocene flora and fauna._ The flora of prevalent dicotyledonous\r\nangiosperms, which appeared in Upper Cretaceous times, also marks the\r\nEocene and later deposits, but a study of the floras indicates that\r\nthe differentiation which now marks off the floras of different areas\r\nfrom one another had not occurred to so great an extent as at the\r\npresent time. The existence of a rich flora in the Eocene beds of\r\ncircumpolar regions in the northern hemisphere should be noted, though\r\nperhaps its importance has been somewhat exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe invertebrate fauna shows an approximation to that of the present\r\nday. The remarkable ammonite fauna of Mesozoic times has disappeared,\r\nand gastropods and lamellibranchs predominate, many of the forms\r\nbelonging to existing genera, though very rarely to existing species.\r\nThe Nummulites are the most characteristic Eocene fossils, and the\r\nperiod may be spoken of as the Nummulitic Period, though it is now\r\nknown that Nummulites are not confined to the Eocene strata.\r\n\r\nThe vertebrate fauna is very noteworthy. The fishes and reptiles are\r\nclosely related to existing forms, and the orders of reptiles which\r\npredominated in Mesozoic times have completely disappeared. But the\r\nmammals are the most interesting vertebrates of the Eocene period.\r\nInstead of the lowly organised forms of Mesozoic times, we find\r\nrepresentatives of many orders, including the highest, the Primates.\r\nThe generalised forms which serve as links between groups which are\r\nnow separated to a considerable extent are of particular importance.\r\nThey have been detected in Eocene rocks of various regions, though the\r\nmost complete series have been obtained from the Eocene rocks of North\r\nAmerica and made known to us through the numerous memoirs of\r\nProfessors Cope and Marsh[105].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: The Eocene floras of Britain are described by Mr J.\r\nStarkie Gardner and Baron von Ettingshausen in the _Monographs of the\r\nPalæontographical Society_; other Monographs of the same Society\r\ncontain an account of the Eocene Mollusca by Mr F. E. Edwards and Mr\r\nS. V. Wood. An idea of the generalised forms of Mammalia may be\r\nobtained by perusal of that portion of Nicholson and Lydekker's\r\n_Manual of Palæontology_ in which the latter author treats of the\r\nMammalia, and in this connexion the reader will do well to read Prof.\r\nHuxley's \"Lecture on Fossil Horses,\" reprinted in his _American\r\nAddresses_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE OLIGOCENE AND MIOCENE PERIODS.\r\n\r\n\r\n(i) _The Oligocene Beds._\r\n\r\n_Classification._ The Oligocene Beds of Britain are classified as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  Upper    Wanting\r\n\r\n  Middle   Hempstead Beds\r\n\r\n         { Bembridge Beds\r\n  Lower  { Osborne Beds\r\n         { Headon Beds\r\n\r\n_Description of the strata._ Little need be said of the deposits of\r\nthis period, either in Britain or abroad, except to remark that they\r\nshow the further spread of continental conditions over the regions now\r\noccupied by land. The British deposits are now seen in the Hampshire\r\nBasin only, and have been spoken of as the fluvio-marine series, as\r\nmany of the strata were laid down in continental sheets of water,\r\nwhile the true marine sediments are thin and infrequent.\r\n\r\nThe lithological characters of deposits formed under these conditions\r\nnaturally vary greatly, consisting of different kinds of mechanical\r\nsediments occasionally mixed with thin freshwater marls and\r\nlimestones. On the Continent similar conditions prevailed, though the\r\noccurrence of fairly wide tracts of level surface is indicated by the\r\nwidespread distribution of beds of brown coal or lignite, and the\r\ncoarse and thick Oligocene 'nagelfluh' of Switzerland points to the\r\nelevation of mountain ranges in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n_The flora and fauna._ The remarks made concerning the Eocene flora\r\nand fauna are generally applicable to those of Oligocene times, except\r\nthat the Oligocene fossils bear a still closer resemblance to living\r\nforms, and the Nummulites are no longer dominant.\r\n\r\n(ii) _The Miocene Period._ Beds of Miocene age are wanting in Britain,\r\nand on the Continent they occur in isolated basins deposited in\r\ngulf-like prolongations of the ocean, never very far from land. A\r\ndescription of the strata and their fossil contents would be of little\r\nuse for our present purposes, and the remarks made concerning the\r\nOligocene beds will apply to the Miocene strata also.\r\n\r\nThe period was mainly remarkable on account of the important physical\r\nchanges which occurred, to which we must devote some consideration.\r\nCommencing with the British area, we find in the south evidence of the\r\nseparation of the London and Hampshire Basins at this time, for the\r\nOligocene beds of Hampshire are tilted up on the south side of an\r\nanticline, which separates the Hampshire Basin from that of London,\r\nindicating that the movement was post-Miocene, while in Kent, beds of\r\nPliocene age rest on the denuded top of the chalk, showing that the\r\nelevation and denudation which accompanied it were pre-Pliocene; the\r\ngreat Wealden anticline is thus seen to be of Miocene age. On the\r\nnorth side of the London Basin the line of demarcation between Eocene\r\nand Mesozoic beds runs approximately parallel to the strike of the\r\nlatter in that part of Britain, and this points to the elevation of\r\nthe Mesozoic strata which gave them their present south-easterly dip\r\nabout the same period, though in the absence of Oligocene rocks it\r\ncannot be definitely stated that the movement was altogether\r\npost-Oligocene. The present physical geography of considerable parts\r\nof Britain must date from Miocene times.\r\n\r\nImportant as the changes were in Britain, they were slight as compared\r\nwith those which affected Europe and many parts of Asia. The great\r\nmountain chains of the Old World received their maximum uplift during\r\nthis great period of earth-movement, and orogenic structures were\r\nimpressed upon the rocks of many regions, for the Tertiary Mountain\r\nChains of the Old World have an Alpine structure impressed upon them\r\nas the result of intense lateral pressure, accordingly we find the\r\nEocene strata lifted far above their original level to heights of\r\n8,000 feet in the Alps and over 12,000 feet in the Himalayas. Away\r\nfrom these marked uplifts epeirogenic movements caused the\r\ndisappearance of the seas of earlier Eocene times, so that towards the\r\nclose of the Miocene Period, the main features of the Eurasian\r\ncontinent were much as they are now. The present drainage-systems must\r\nhave originated at the same time, and the sculpture of our continent\r\nhas been carried on more or less continuously by subaerial agents from\r\nMiocene times to the present day. That any addition to the total area\r\nof land was made is doubtful. The land which appears to have existed\r\nto the west of Britain during Cretaceous and Eocene times finally\r\ndisappeared beneath the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, and the movement\r\nprobably gave rise to the prominent submarine feature which now exists\r\nat some distance from the coast of Ireland. A great marine period is\r\nnow existent in our ocean areas, but so far as the existing\r\ncontinents are concerned, we are living on the fourth continental\r\nperiod which practically came into existence in Miocene times.\r\n\r\nThe strike of the uplifted strata naturally coincides on the whole\r\nwith the axes of the major uplifts, and accordingly we find the\r\nMesozoic and early Tertiary strata folded around axes which have a\r\nprevalent east and west direction, with others which have a trend at\r\nright angles to this. The strike of the British Mesozoic rocks seems\r\nto have been determined by each of these sets of movements, so that\r\nalthough it is east and west in the south of England, it runs north\r\nand south in the eastern counties north of the Thames.\r\n\r\nIn America, although epeirogenic movements had occurred before Miocene\r\ntimes, with the formation of wide continental tracts, these appear to\r\nhave been of the nature of plains, diversified by extensive inland\r\nsheets of water, and uplift of orogenic character converted these\r\nplains into uneven tracts in Miocene times. Many of the movements in\r\nAmerica, which like those of Europe are still progressing with\r\nenfeebled power, differ from those of Eurasia, giving rise to raised\r\nmonoclinal blocks rather than to violent folds of Alpine character, as\r\nseen in the western territories of North America, and as proved also\r\nby the differential movements which are now known to affect the\r\nAtlantic coast of that continent.\r\n\r\nAccompanying these changes in the earth's crust were others which\r\naffected the climate, at any rate locally. The warm climate of Eocene\r\ntimes gradually gave way to a cooler climate in Oligocene times, and\r\nthis lowering of temperature was still further advanced in Miocene\r\ntimes, though there is evidence that the temperature of those parts of\r\nEurope which have strata representative of the Miocene period was\r\nhigher than it is at the present day.\r\n\r\nOwing to the changes which occurred in Miocene times, the area of\r\nsedimentation was extensively shifted to our present oceans, and\r\naccordingly we find that the times subsequent to those of the Miocene\r\nuplifts are marked by scattered accumulations of continental\r\ncharacter, with a few insignificant marine strata seldom found far\r\ninland from the present coast-lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE PLIOCENE BEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification._ The Italian Pliocene Beds which have long been known\r\nhave been divided into three stages, to which names have been applied\r\nwhich are somewhat widely used, though the division of the British\r\ndeposits into the same three stages has not been made. The stages\r\nare:--\r\n\r\n  Astian.\r\n\r\n  Plaisancean.\r\n\r\n  Zanclean.\r\n\r\nThe classification of the British deposits may be made as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Cromer \"Forest\" Series.\r\n\r\n  Weybourne Crag and Bure Valley Beds.\r\n\r\n  Chillesford Crag.\r\n\r\n  Norwich Crag and Red Crag.\r\n\r\n  Upper Coralline Crag.\r\n\r\n  Lower Coralline Crag.\r\n\r\nAs the English deposits are somewhat scattered it is difficult to make\r\nout the exact order of succession, but the above shows the\r\nclassification which is adopted by the best authorities, the Norwich\r\nCrag (or Fluvio-marine Crag as it is sometimes termed) being now\r\nsupposed to represent the upper portion of the Red Crag.\r\n\r\n_Description of the strata._ The British deposits are chiefly found in\r\nthe counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, but isolated patches have been\r\ndetected in Kent and at St Erth in Cornwall; while the inclusion of\r\nPliocene fossils in the glacial deposits of Aberdeenshire and on the\r\nwest coasts and islands of Great Britain suggests the occurrence of\r\nPliocene beds beneath sea-level, around the British coasts, at no\r\ngreat distance from the land.\r\n\r\nThe term 'Crag' has been applied to shelly sands of which the British\r\nPliocene beds are largely composed. The oldest British Pliocene strata\r\nare supposed to be the Lenham Beds, occurring in 'pipes' on the Chalk\r\nof the North Downs, which are referred to the Lower Coralline Crag,\r\nand some writers believe that the St Erth beds of Cornwall are of\r\nsimilar age[106]. The former are ferruginous sands, and the latter\r\nshelly sands and clays. The higher beds of the Coralline Crag are\r\nfound in Suffolk, and are largely calcareous, being made of remains of\r\npolyzoa, molluscs, and other invertebrates. They were probably\r\ndeposited in deeper water than the rest of the British Pliocene\r\nstrata, and contain a far larger percentage of carbonate of lime. The\r\nRed Crag consists of ferruginous shelly sands, of the nature of\r\nsand-banks, formed near land; while the Norwich Crag is of a still\r\nmore littoral character, and contains remains of land shells and the\r\nbones of mammalia mingled with the marine shells of the coast. The\r\nhigher Pliocene deposits are also coastal accumulations, even the\r\nso-called Forest bed being a deposit and not a true surface soil, as\r\nproved by the observations of Mr Clement Reid. At the summit of the\r\nCromer 'Forest' Series, however, is a true freshwater bed. These\r\nBritish deposits appear to have been laid down on a coast line which\r\nformed one side of the estuary of a large river, of which the present\r\nRhine is the 'betrunked' portion (to use a term introduced by Prof. W.\r\nM. Davis)[107].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: See Clement Reid, _Nature_, 1886, p. 342; and Kendall\r\nand Bell, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. XLII. p. 201.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: See a paper by Mr F. W. Harmer, \"On the Pliocene\r\nDeposits of Holland, and their relationship to the English and Belgian\r\nCrags,\" _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. LII. p. 748.]\r\n\r\nOn the European continent, marine Pliocene beds are found in Belgium\r\nand Italy. The former deposits greatly resemble our Crags, whilst the\r\nlatter are of interest on account of the mixture of volcanic beds with\r\nmarine sediments in Sicily, showing that the formation of Etna\r\ncommenced in Pliocene times. Various deposits formed in inland basins\r\nare found in France and Germany, but the most remarkable occur in the\r\nVienna basin, where Caspian conditions prevailed over large areas, and\r\nthe ordinary strata alternate with chemical deposits of which the\r\nbest-known are the celebrated rock salt masses of Wieliczka, near\r\nCracow. At the same time volcanic activity was rife to the south of\r\nthe Carpathian mountains. Other deposits, which are partly referable\r\nto the Pliocene period, occur in Greece at Pikermi, and in India in\r\nthe Siwalik hills; these are celebrated for their remarkable mammals,\r\nas are the Pliocene strata of the Western territories of North\r\nAmerica. The occurrence of marked earth-movements since Pliocene times\r\nis indicated by the nature of the deposits of Barbadoes, where\r\nradiolarian cherts have furnished two echinids which are described by\r\nDr Gregory as deep-sea forms. These beds were once referred to the\r\nMiocene period, but there is good reason for assigning them to a later\r\ndate, and correlating them with the Pliocene beds of other areas, in\r\nwhich case there must have been a considerable uplift in this region\r\nsince Pliocene times, a fact of great theoretical importance.\r\n\r\nThe climatic conditions of Pliocene times show steady fall of\r\ntemperature. The early Pliocene beds of Britain were deposited during\r\nthe prevalence of warmer temperatures than those which now exist in\r\nthe same area, but during later Pliocene times, the temperature was at\r\nfirst similar to that now prevailing, and afterwards distinctly\r\ncolder, and we find in the upper Pliocene beds the remains of\r\norganisms of a northern type. In the uppermost deposit of the Cromer\r\n'Forest' Series, the arctic birch and arctic willow indicate the\r\ncommencement of the cold which culminated in the succeeding 'Great Ice\r\nAge.'\r\n\r\n_The flora and fauna._ Little need be said of the Pliocene fossils:\r\nthe flora approaches that of present times, and the invertebrates are\r\nin most cases specifically identical with those now living. The\r\nvertebrates alone differ markedly from living forms, being chiefly of\r\nextinct species, and in many cases belonging to extinct genera. It is\r\ninteresting to find that the mammalian fauna of Pliocene times\r\nresembles the existing fauna of the area in which the beds are found,\r\na fact long ago observed by Darwin. Thus the European Pliocene mammals\r\nare like existing European forms, whilst in Australia the mammalian\r\nterrestrial fauna consists of Marsupials, and in South America there\r\nare Edentata of Pliocene age[108].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: The Pliocene fauna of Britain is described by Mr\r\nSearles V. Wood in the _Monographs of the Palæontographical\r\nSociety_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE PLEISTOCENE ACCUMULATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification._ The term Pleistocene, as used here, is approximately\r\nequivalent to the expressions 'Glacial Period' and 'Great Ice Age' of\r\nsome writers; but I have adopted it in preference to these\r\nexpressions, because it may eventually be possible to define the\r\nPleistocene period in such a manner as to give the term a strictly\r\nchronological meaning, whereas the other terms indicate the existence\r\nof climatic conditions which must have ceased in some areas sooner\r\nthan in others. At present, climatic change gives us the best means\r\nfor separating the accumulations formed subsequently to the Pliocene\r\nperiod over large parts of the Eurasian land-tract, and the most\r\nconvenient division of these continental accumulations is to refer\r\nthem to three periods, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  The Forest Period (in which we are now living).\r\n\r\n  The Steppe Period.\r\n\r\n  The Glacial Period.\r\n\r\nSome of the accumulations which were formed during the Steppe period\r\nare included in the Pleistocene period by many writers, but I prefer\r\nto treat of them as post-Pleistocene.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of our knowledge of the glacial deposits any\r\nattempt to make a classification applicable over very wide areas is\r\ndoomed to failure, and the very principles upon which the\r\nclassification should be based are a subject of disagreement. The most\r\npromising basis for classification is founded on alternate recession\r\nand advance of land-ice, though the proofs that advance takes place\r\nsimultaneously over very wide areas are not yet forthcoming. Dr J.\r\nGeikie in the last edition of his work _The Great Ice Age_ adopts four\r\nperiods of glaciation, with intervening periods of recession, and this\r\ndivision accords with the observations of many foreign geologists. In\r\norder to understand the method of classification upon this basis, a\r\nfew words concerning glacial deposits in general will not be out of\r\nplace. Glacial accumulations may be divided into three classes:--(i)\r\ntrue glacial accumulations, formed on, in, and under the ice, and left\r\nbehind upon its recession, (ii) marine glacial deposits, laid down in\r\nthe sea, when floating ice is extensively found on its surface, and\r\n(iii) fluvio-glacial deposits, laid down by streams which come from\r\nthe ice. The two former indicate glacial conditions, while the\r\noccurrence of fluvio-glacial deposits overlain by true glacial\r\ndeposits indicates an advance of land-ice, for the fluvio-glacial\r\ndeposits are accumulated in front of those which are truly glacial.\r\nAccordingly if we find alternations of glacial and fluvio-glacial\r\ndeposits on a large scale, we may fairly infer the alternation of\r\nperiods of great glaciation with others when the ice diminished, or in\r\nother words of glacial and interglacial periods. There is, however, in\r\nmany cases great difficulty in distinguishing glacial deposits from\r\nmarine glacial ones, while some of the true glacial deposits formed\r\n_in_ the ice (englacial deposits) cannot readily be distinguished from\r\nthose of fluvio-glacial origin. Furthermore, as the terminal moraines\r\nof land-ice often rest upon other true glacial deposits, it is often\r\ndifficult to know whether we are dealing with the products of one or\r\ntwo glaciations over limited areas. The test of superposition is often\r\napplicable, and one is enabled to obtain some clue as to the relative\r\norder of events. In England at least three periods of glaciation seem\r\nto be indicated by the glacial deposits. On the east coast the Cromer\r\nForest Series is succeeded by the Cromer Till, and in Yorkshire the\r\nBasement Clay occupies a similar position with regard to the overlying\r\nglacial accumulations to that of the Cromer Till. Whether these\r\ndeposits be marine or terrestrial, and the evidence is not yet\r\nsufficient to settle this question to the satisfaction of all\r\ngeologists, there is no doubt that they are glacial. Above them, in\r\nEast Anglia, lies the Contorted Drift, the origin of which is still a\r\nmoot point, and it is overlain by the great Chalky Boulder Clay, which\r\nextends far and wide over East Anglia, the Midland Counties and into\r\nYorkshire. Evidence has been adduced to connect this with the _till_\r\nor boulder clay which spreads over the upland districts of the north\r\nof England at the foot of the main hill-systems. This set of deposits\r\nindicates a second glaciation. As the upland till is often ploughed\r\nout by glaciers which have left their traces in the form of moraines\r\nin our upland regions, we seem here to have evidence of a third\r\nglaciation, which naturally leaves no traces in the southern\r\ndistricts, and the exact age of this cannot be ascertained in the\r\nabsence of fossil evidence, though we may provisionally refer it to\r\nthe Pleistocene period.\r\n\r\nAnother attempt has been made to classify the glacial deposits, on the\r\nsupposition that there have been periods of elevation and depression\r\nof the land during Pleistocene times. Some writers advocate one\r\ninterglacial period when the land was depressed to an extent of 1400\r\nand perhaps 2000 feet, while others have advocated the occurrence of a\r\nnumber of such interglacial marine periods. The evidence for the\r\nsupposed oscillations is furnished by the existence of shell-bearing\r\nsands associated with boulder clays at high levels, the best known\r\nbeing on Moel Tryfan in Caernarvonshire, near Macclesfield in\r\nCheshire, and near Oswestry in Shropshire. As many geologists believe\r\nthat these shells have been carried to their present position by ice\r\nin a way which it is not our province to discuss here, we may dismiss\r\nthis method of classification as based upon events which cannot be\r\nproved to have occurred. In the present state of our knowledge, it is\r\nindeed best to avoid, as far as possible, classifications which are\r\nintended to be applicable over wide regions, and to devote our\r\nattention to local details, gradually piecing together the evidence\r\nwhich is obtained as the result of exhaustive examination of each\r\nseparate area[109].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: The glacial literature of our own island only, is so\r\nextensive that the student may well be bewildered when he attempts to\r\ngrapple with it.

The occurrence of elevation to a greater height than that\r\nwhich our country at present possesses during portions at any rate of\r\nthe glacial period has been inferred on general grounds, but direct\r\nevidence in favour of it is furnished by the existence of a number of\r\nancient valleys on the land around our coasts, whose floors are often\r\nconsiderably below sea-level, while the valleys are now completely\r\nfilled up with glacial accumulations, except where they have been\r\npartially re-excavated by streams which for some distance run above\r\nthe courses of the ancient streams.\r\n\r\nThe climatic conditions of glacial times can only be briefly touched\r\nupon in this place. If the periods of advance can be proved to be\r\ncontemporaneous over wide areas, this points to alternations of colder\r\nand warmer periods, or at any rate of drier and wetter periods, though\r\nlocal advance may be due to a number of causes. It must be borne in\r\nmind that with the temperature remaining the same, advance of ice can\r\nbe brought about by increased precipitation of aqueous vapour in the\r\nform of snow.\r\n\r\nThe question of the cause of the glacial period is one that only\r\nindirectly affects the stratigraphical geologist until he has\r\naccumulated sufficient evidence to indicate the cause. It must suffice\r\nto observe that the extremely plausible hypothesis of Croll (for which\r\nthe student should consult Dr Croll's _Climate and Time_) does not\r\nexplain the apparent gradual lowering of climate throughout Tertiary\r\ntimes till the cold culminated in the Pleistocene period, and the\r\nstudent will do well to remain in suspense concerning the cause of the\r\nIce Age until further evidence has been brought to bear upon it.\r\n\r\n_The glacial flora and fauna._ The glacial deposits naturally yield\r\nfew traces of life, except those which have been derived from other\r\ndeposits, and we are dependent for our information concerning the\r\nfauna and flora of the glacial period upon the remains furnished by\r\nthe interglacial deposits. Unfortunately it is very hard to ascertain\r\nwhich deposits are interglacial, and many which have been claimed as\r\nsuch are either preglacial or postglacial. The meagre evidence which\r\nwe possess points to the existence of an arctic fauna or flora in\r\nBritain during the prevalence of this glacial period. A question which\r\nhas received much attention of recent years is that of the existence\r\nof preglacial or interglacial man, on which much has been written. The\r\nexistence of man in glacial times is probable, but it is the opinion\r\nof many of those who are most competent to form a judgment, that it\r\nhas not been proved in the only conclusive way, namely, by the\r\ndiscovery of relics of man in deposits which are directly overlain by\r\nglacial deposits, or which at any rate are demonstrably older than\r\nglacial deposits[110].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: On the question of preglacial and interglacial man, see\r\nW. Boyd Dawkins, _Early Man in Britain_; H. Hicks, _Quart. Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc._, vol. XLII. p. 3, XLIV. p. 561, and XLVIII. p. 453; T.\r\nMcK. Hughes, _ibid._, vol. XLIII. p. 73; Sir J. Evans, _Presidential\r\nAddress to British Assoc._ 1897.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE STEPPE PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of a period marked by dry climate over wide areas of\r\nthe Eurasian continent, and possibly also in North America, is\r\nevidenced by the widespread distribution of an accumulation known as\r\n_loess_, concerning the origin of which there has been much difference\r\nof opinion, though that it was formed subsequently to the glacial\r\nperiod seems to be generally admitted, inasmuch as it is largely\r\ncomposed of rearranged glacial mud. The formation of the loess as a\r\nsteppe-deposit was first advocated by Baron von Richthofen, and his\r\nviews were supported by Nehring after study of the loess-fauna.\r\nRichthofen's explanation of the loess as due to the spread of dust by\r\nwind in a dry region is becoming widely accepted, and it necessitates\r\nthe widespread occurrence of steppe conditions, as the loess has a\r\nvery extensive geographical range, and may be truly regarded as the\r\nnormal continental deposit of Eurasia during the period immediately\r\nsucceeding the glacial period. In our own country, as the sea cannot\r\nhave been far distant during these times the normal loess is not\r\nfound, but several accumulations occur, which on stratigraphical and\r\npalæontological grounds must be regarded as synchronous with the\r\nformation of the loess. These are certain rubble-drifts of the\r\nsouthern counties, the older river-gravels of southern England, and\r\nsome of the older cave deposits of various parts of England. It is\r\ndoubtful whether any classification into minute subdivisions can be\r\nadopted for them, though Prof. Boyd Dawkins has advocated their\r\nseparation into an older age of River Drift Man, and a newer period of\r\nCave Man, on account of the evidences of a lower state of civilisation\r\nafforded by examination of the River Drift implements when compared\r\nwith those fashioned by Cave Man. Roughly speaking, the Steppe period\r\ncorresponds with the period during which Palæolithic man existed, at\r\nany rate in north-west Europe, and we may speak of the Steppe period\r\nas the Palæolithic period, without asserting that Palæolithic man\r\nnecessarily disappeared at the time when the climate changed and\r\ncaused the replacement of Steppe conditions by others favourable to\r\nforest-growth.\r\n\r\n_Description of the accumulations._ The loess consists of unstratified\r\ncalcareous mud or dust, with a peculiar vertical fracture, and is\r\ninteresting rather on account of the nature of its fossils and of its\r\ndistribution than for its lithological characters. As it is not found\r\nin Britain it is not necessary to say much about it, but merely to\r\nrefer to the published descriptions[111].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: An account of Richthofen's views by that author will be\r\nfound in the _Geological Magazine_, Dec. 2, vol. IX. (1882), p. 293,\r\nand the fauna of the loess is described by Nehring (_Ibid._, p. 570).]\r\n\r\nThe British deposits require some notice, as their characters and mode\r\nof occurrence are of some significance. Along the south coast are\r\ndeposits of coarse rubble which have yielded some organic remains,\r\nwhich have been described by Mr Clement Reid[112], who also discusses\r\ntheir origin. The rock, also known as the Elephant Bed, consists of\r\nangular fragments of flint and chalk, and seems to have been produced\r\nby streams which were able to flow over the surface of the chalk when\r\nit was frozen. Many other similar deposits in the south of England,\r\nwhich are found on the open surface, may have had a similar origin.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: C. Reid, \"Origin of Dry Chalk Valleys and of Coombe\r\nRock,\" _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. XLIII. p. 364.]\r\n\r\nThe Palæolithic river-gravels are found at various distances above\r\npresent river-levels, and are the surviving relics of alluvial\r\ndeposits which were laid down when the rivers ran at a higher level\r\nthan they now do. That they are newer than the main glacial drifts of\r\nthe region in which they occur is indicated by the frequent presence\r\nin them of boulders derived from the drift. Their antiquity is shown\r\nby the physical changes which have occurred since their deposition\r\n(there having been sufficient time since then to allow of the\r\nexcavation of some river-valleys to a depth of over one hundred feet\r\nbeneath their former level), and also by the character of the included\r\nmammals which will presently be referred to. The deposits vary in\r\ncoarseness, like those of modern alluvial flats, from the coarse\r\ngravels of the river-beds to the fine loams and marls of the\r\nflood-plains. They are found, in Britain, with their typical mammalian\r\nremains, south-east of a line drawn from the mouth of the Tees to the\r\nBristol Channel.\r\n\r\nThe cave-deposits have a wider distribution than those which have just\r\nbeen noticed, being also found to the north-west of the\r\nabove-mentioned line in Yorkshire, and in North and South Wales. In\r\nthe south of England they are found as far east as Ightham in Kent,\r\nand in a westerly direction to Torquay and Tenby. The Ightham deposits\r\noccur in fissures and consist of materials which were apparently\r\nintroduced from above by river action[113]. The cave-deposits of\r\nlimestone areas are sometimes found in fissures, but at other times in\r\ncaverns with a fairly horizontal floor, on which the various\r\naccumulations lie in order of formation. The deposits vary in\r\ncharacter and may be divided into three groups, though accumulations\r\nof intermediate character are found; the first group consists of\r\ncave-earths and cave-breccias--formed by weathering of the limestone,\r\nand the retention of the insoluble residue, as a more or less\r\nferruginous mud, mixed with angular fragments of limestone, and with\r\nthe remains of creatures which inhabited the caves; the second group\r\nconsists of true deposits laid down under water, as gravels, sands,\r\nand laminated clays; while the third is composed of limestone\r\ndeposited from solution in water, in the form of stalagmite[114].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: The Ightham fissures and their contents are described\r\nby Messrs Abbot and Newton, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. L. pp.\r\n171 and 188.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: The reader should consult Prof. W. Boyd Dawkins' works\r\non _Cave Hunting_ and _Early Man in Britain_, for information\r\nconcerning the Cave Deposits. See also Sir C. Lyell, _Antiquity of\r\nMan_; Sir J. Evans, _Ancient Stone Implements of Great Britain_, and\r\nSir J. Lubbock, _Prehistoric Times_. In these works references will be\r\nfound to papers by Messrs Pengelly, Magens Mello, Tiddeman and others\r\non the Caves of Devon, Derbyshire and Yorkshire. References have\r\nalready been made to papers upon the Caverns of North Wales.]\r\n\r\nThe organic contents of the Palæolithic period are of much interest,\r\nand it is desirable to discuss their character before making further\r\nobservations upon the physical conditions of the period.\r\n\r\n_The Palæolithic flora and fauna._ The plants of some of the earlier\r\ndeposits of the age we are considering show the prevalence of cold\r\nconditions during their accumulation, for instance the Arctic birch\r\nand Arctic willow are found in the accumulations beneath the\r\nimplement-bearing Palæolithic deposits of Hoxne in Suffolk[115]. The\r\ninvertebrate fauna consists essentially of the remains of molluscs.\r\nThe loess molluscs are chiefly pulmoniferous gastropods which lived\r\nupon the land, though swamp forms are occasionally associated with\r\nthem. The palæolithic river-gravels have yielded numerous land- and\r\nfreshwater-molluscs of living species, though some which are abundant\r\nin the British gravels are now extinct in Britain, e.g. _Cyrena\r\n(Cobicula) fluminalis_ and _Unio littoralis_. Marine deposits of this\r\nage are occasionally found, as at March, in Cambridgeshire, where the\r\nfauna closely resembles that of our present sea-shores.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: These beds are described by Messrs Reid and Ridley,\r\n_Geol. Mag._ Dec. III. vol. V. p. 441. See also C. Reid on the\r\n\"History of the Recent Flora of Britain,\" _Annals of Botany_, vol. II.\r\nNo. 8, Aug. 1888.]\r\n\r\nThe vertebrate remains are much more remarkable, and it is not quite\r\nclear that the association of forms whose living allies now live under\r\nwidely different conditions has been satisfactorily explained. The\r\nriver-gravels and cave-deposits contain remains of temperate forms, as\r\nthe bison, and brown bear, associated with those of northern forms, as\r\nthe mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, glutton, reindeer, and musk ox, and\r\nalso with those whose living allies are inhabitants of warmer regions,\r\nlike the lion, hyæna, and hippopotamus. One of the most remarkable\r\ncreatures is the sabre-toothed lion or _Machairodus_, remains of which\r\nhave been discovered in Kent's Cavern, Torquay, and in the caves of\r\nCresswell Crags, Derbyshire.\r\n\r\nThe loess fauna consists of characteristic steppe animals, such as the\r\njerboa, Saiga antelope and steppe-porcupine, and it is interesting to\r\nfind an indication of this fauna in the Ightham fissures.\r\n\r\nThe first undoubted relics of mankind are found in the Palæolithic\r\ndeposits, which are very widely spread over the Eurasian continent.\r\nThey consist mainly of implements of bone and stone, the latter being\r\nchipped, but never ground or polished, though both bone and stone\r\nimplements are frequently ornamented with engraved figures. The\r\ncave-deposits have furnished implements of a higher type than those\r\nusually found in the river-drifts, but the latter are also found in\r\ncaverns in deposits beneath those containing the higher type, hence\r\nthe division of the period into two minor periods, that of river-drift\r\nman, and that of cave-man[116].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: Concerning this matter, the reader should consult Prof.\r\nBoyd Dawkins' _Early Man in Britain_. Sir J. Prestwich has argued in\r\nfavour of the existence of a group of implements found on the plateau\r\nsouth of the Thames of an age antecedent to that of the ordinary\r\nriver-drift implements. See _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. XLV. p.\r\n270.]\r\n\r\nThere are several questions of interest connected with the Palæolithic\r\nfauna, three of which deserve some notice here. The absence of the\r\nrelics of the Palæolithic mammalia and of the human implements in the\r\nriver-gravels north-west of the line drawn between the Tees and\r\nBristol Channel, and the presence of the mammalian remains in the\r\ncaverns of that area requires some explanation. One such explanation\r\nassumes that the relics were destroyed in the open country to the\r\nnorth-west of that line, owing to glaciation, but it is not by any\r\nmeans universally accepted.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty which in the opinion of some writers has not been\r\nfully cleared up is the mixture of apparently southern forms like the\r\nHippopotamus, with others of northern character like the Musk ox,\r\nunder such conditions as to show that the creatures lived in the\r\nBritish area contemporaneously. Seasonal migration might account for\r\nit, but the wide belt of overlap of apparent northern and southern\r\nforms requires something more, though secular changes of climate might\r\nshift the belt of seasonal overlap from one place to another, causing\r\nthe entire belt of overlap to extend over a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nThe third, and perhaps most important difficulty is the abrupt change\r\nfrom the Palæolithic type of implement to the Neolithic type,\r\ncharacteristic of the next period. Some implements, as those of the\r\nkitchen-middens of Denmark, and those found at Brandon and Cissbury in\r\nthis country, have been appealed to as intermediate in character, but\r\nevidence has been brought forward to show that each set is truly\r\nNeolithic, the one being the implements of the lowly fisher-folk who\r\nlived contemporaneously with the makers of the highly finished\r\npolished implements of Denmark, while the others are unfinished\r\nimplements thrown away during the manufacture on account of flaws or\r\naccidental fractures. The difficulty is increased when we take into\r\naccount the great physical and faunistic changes which occurred\r\nbetween Palæolithic and Neolithic times.\r\n\r\nThe country was undoubtedly more elevated than it is at present during\r\nportions if not during the whole of Palæolithic times, as shown by the\r\nappearance of the great mammals in Britain, the discovery of their\r\nremains beneath sea-level, and especially the occurrence of remains in\r\nthe caverns of rocky islands such as those of the Bristol Channel,\r\nwhere they could not possibly have existed unless the present islands\r\nwere connected with the mainland.\r\n\r\nThe fossils of the times between the Glacial period and the Neolithic\r\nperiod indicate variations of climatic conditions. Upon this point I\r\ncannot do better than quote the words of Sir John Evans in his\r\nPresidential Address to the British Association at Toronto[117]. \"At\r\nHoxne the interval between the deposit of the Boulder clay and of the\r\nimplement-bearing beds is distinctly proved to have witnessed at least\r\ntwo noteworthy changes in climate. The beds immediately reposing on\r\nthe clay are characterised by the presence of alder in abundance, of\r\nhazel, and yew, as well as by that of numerous flowering plants\r\nindicative of a temperate climate very different from that under which\r\nthe Boulder clay itself was formed. Above these beds characterised by\r\ntemperate plants, comes a thick and more recent series of strata, in\r\nwhich leaves of the dwarf Arctic willow and birch abound, and which\r\nwere in all probability deposited under conditions like those of the\r\ncold regions of Siberia and North America.\r\n\r\n\"At a higher level, and of more recent date than these--from which\r\nthey are entirely distinct--are the beds containing the Palæolithic\r\nimplements, formed in all probability under conditions not essentially\r\ndifferent from those of the present day.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: _Report Brit. Assoc._ for 1897, p. 13.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE FOREST PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequently to Palæolithic times, the physical conditions over\r\nEurasia changed greatly, and at the commencement of Neolithic times\r\nthe conditions were favourable for the growth of forests over wide\r\nregions of that continent. At the commencement of the Forest period\r\nthe physical conditions were very much the same as they are at\r\npresent, though minor changes have of course taken place since then,\r\nincluding probably a submergence of large parts of Britain to a depth\r\nof about fifty feet beneath its former level, as indicated by the\r\nexistence of Neolithic submerged forests round many parts of our\r\ncoast-lines.\r\n\r\nThe Forest period may be best subdivided for local purposes by\r\nreference to the civilisation of mankind at different times, and in\r\nthis way we obtain the following divisions:\r\n\r\n  Historic Iron age.\r\n  Prehistoric Iron age.\r\n  Bronze age.\r\n  Neolithic age.\r\n\r\nA classification may also be based upon changes in the flora. In\r\nDenmark the peat deposits of this age are divisible into five layers,\r\ncharacterised by different dominant forms of trees. These are as\r\nfollows in descending order:\r\n\r\n  Fifth layer:   Beech ... Iron age\r\n  Fourth layer:  Alder\r\n  Third layer:   Oak ... Bronze age\r\n  Second layer:  Scotch Firs ... Neolithic age\r\n  Lowest layer:  Poplar.\r\n\r\nIn our own country the forest growth has been much interfered with by\r\nman, but the lower fenland peat gives a good example of the material\r\nformed by forest growth. It is not necessary to touch on the various\r\naccumulations which are now being formed in different parts of our\r\nisland, except to remark that the deposits of the Forest period give\r\nindications of earth-movements on a small scale, which is well seen in\r\nthe fenland, where the forest peat is covered in places by a \"buttery\r\nclay\" with _Scrobicularia piperata_ indicating submergence, and above\r\nthis is a marsh peat.\r\n\r\nThe flora and fauna of the Forest period are practically those of the\r\npresent day, though the larger forms of mammalia have disappeared one\r\nby one. The Irish elk and _Bos primogenius_ probably became extinct\r\nearly in the period, while as far as Britain is concerned the wolf,\r\nbear, and beaver have disappeared within historic times.\r\n\r\nThe relics of man deserve passing notice. The Neolithic period is\r\ncharacterised by the absence of metal instruments, though those made\r\nof stone were much more highly finished than those of Palæolithic\r\ntimes, and were often ground and polished. The first metal which was\r\nlargely worked was bronze, which gradually replaced stone, though\r\nstone was extensively used in the Bronze age, as indicated by the\r\nimitation of bronze implements in stone. The Bronze age in turn was\r\nreplaced by the Prehistoric iron age; at first, when iron was scarce,\r\nbronze implements were merely tipped with iron, but ultimately the one\r\nmetal was practically replaced by the other.\r\n\r\nThe date of the Palæolithic period is unknown; no approximate date can\r\nbe satisfactorily assigned to it, but various calculations, founded on\r\ndifferent data, have been made as to the age of the Neolithic period,\r\nand several of them agree in placing it at about 7000 years from the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that no sudden and violent change marks the incoming\r\nof the human race, which to the geologist is but one of a large number\r\nof events which have followed each other in unbroken sequence, and\r\naccordingly the thread of the story where abandoned by the geologist\r\nis taken up by the antiquary, and passed on by him to the\r\nhistorian[118].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: The student may obtain information concerning the\r\nNeolithic age in Britain in Boyd Dawkins's _Early Man in Britain_; Sir\r\nJ. Evans' _Early Stone Implements of Great Britain_, and Sir J.\r\nLubbock's _Prehistoric Times_.

Madsen's\r\n_Antiquités Préhistoriques du Danemark_. The Prehistoric fauna of the\r\nfenlands is described in Sir R. Owen's _History of British Fossil\r\nMammals and Birds_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON VARIOUS QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many problems connected with geology which can only be\r\nsolved by detailed study of the stratified rocks, and when solved the\r\nprinciples of the science will be more fully elucidated. In the\r\npresent state of our knowledge some of these problems are ripe for\r\ndiscussion, others can merely be indicated, while others again have\r\nprobably remained hidden, though it will be the task of the geologist\r\nof the future to clear them up. Among the many questions which demand\r\nknowledge of stratigraphical geology for their right understanding are\r\nthe following, which will be briefly considered in this chapter:--the\r\nchanges in the position of land and sea in past times, and the growth\r\nof continents; the replacement of a school of uniformitarianism by one\r\nof evolutionism; and the duration of geological time.\r\n\r\n_Changes in the position of land and sea._ Certain physicists have\r\narrived at the conclusion that the general position of our oceans and\r\ncontinents was determined at a very early period in the earth's\r\nhistory, and that the changes which have occurred in their position\r\nsince then have been comparatively insignificant. The wide extent of\r\nland over which stratified rocks are distributed at once indicates\r\nthat from the point of view of the geologist the changes have been\r\nvery important, and it is worth inquiring whether they are not\r\nsufficiently important to prove that the primitive oceans and\r\ncontinents have undergone so much alteration as to be unrecognisable.\r\nSome authorities, while recognising the great changes which have\r\noccurred in the relative position of land and sea during those periods\r\nof which geologists have direct information, suppose that the changes\r\ntook place to a large degree in certain 'critical areas' bordering the\r\nmore stable areas of permanent ocean on the one side and permanent\r\nland on the other.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the question of general permanence of land and ocean\r\nregions it will be convenient to commence with a study of the present\r\nland areas, and at the outset we may take into consideration the\r\npresent distribution of marine sediment over different parts of the\r\nland, using the last edition of M. Jules Marcou's geological map of\r\nthe world for the purpose[119]. A glimpse at this map indicates that\r\nmore than half of the land areas are occupied by rocks which are as\r\nyet unknown (many of which _may_ be marine sediments), or by\r\ncrystalline schists of which the mode of origin has not yet been fully\r\nexplained, so that a large part of Central Asia, the interior of\r\nAfrica, and of South America may have existed as land from very early\r\ntimes, and the same may be said of smaller portions of Europe and\r\nNorth America. Actual observation of a geological map therefore\r\nindicates the possibility that about half of the land surfaces may\r\nhave existed as such through very long periods, but though there is a\r\npossibility of this, the probability is not very great. The unknown\r\nregions, as remarked above, may consist to a considerable extent of\r\nmarine sediments, and the existence of isolated patches of late\r\nPalæozoic and of Mesozoic strata in the heart of Central Asia, points\r\nto the submergence of much wider regions than those in which these\r\nisolated patches have been found. Again, the character of the\r\nsediments when they abut against the crystalline schists frequently\r\nproves that these sediments once extended further over the crystalline\r\nschists, and have since been removed by denudation, so that even if we\r\nassume that the crystalline schists are all of very early date, and\r\nnot necessarily formed in any case from marine sediments, we cannot\r\nsuppose that all the area occupied by them has existed as land for\r\nlong periods of time. On the other hand, the major part of Europe and\r\nNorth Africa, extensive tracts in Asia, the greater part of Australia,\r\na very large part of North America and considerable tracts of South\r\nAmerica give proofs of having been occupied by the oceans in Palæozoic\r\nand later times.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: A reduced copy of this map will be found opposite the\r\ntitle-page of the first volume of Prof. Prestwich's _Geology_.]\r\n\r\nIt may be answered that most of these regions containing marine\r\nsediments occur in critical areas, which have undergone a certain\r\namount of oscillation owing to earth-movements, and that the interior\r\nparts of the great continental masses have been practically\r\nstationary. But if these lands had been land-areas through geological\r\nages they must have been acted upon by the agents of subaerial\r\ndenudation, throughout these ages, and long ago reduced to\r\npeneplains[120] unless the action of these subaerial agents was\r\ncounteracted by that of elevating forces, but if these forces were\r\nsufficient to counteract the action of subaerial denudation through\r\ncountless ages, they were also sufficient to raise extensive tracts\r\nof land above sea-level, and materially to alter the distribution of\r\nland and sea, and if elevation could go on to this extent, why not\r\nalso depression?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: A term proposed by Prof. W. M. Davis for a nearly level\r\nsurface of subaerial denudation, as opposed to a plain of marine\r\ndenudation.]\r\n\r\nProceeding a step further, and examining the character of the\r\nsediments as well as their geographical distribution, we find\r\nfurther evidence of great crust-movements. It has been urged that\r\ndeep-water sediments do not occur amongst the strata found on the\r\ncontinents,--that there are no representatives of the abysmal deposits\r\nof recent ocean floors amongst the strata of the geological\r\ncolumn[121], but the researches of the last two decades have brought\r\nto light foraminiferal and radiolarian deposits, pteropodal deposits,\r\nand possibly deep-sea clays, which are comparable with those in\r\nprocess of formation at great depths in existing oceans, and though\r\nthe proofs of their deep-sea origin are not always as full as might be\r\ndesired in the case of the older rocks[122], we can speak with greater\r\ncertainty when we examine those of Tertiary age, and if the deep-sea\r\naccumulations of this late date can be uplifted above sea-level, this\r\nis much more likely to have occurred with those of past times. When a\r\ndeposit like the radiolarian rock of Barbadoes, the deep-water\r\ncharacter of which has been conclusively proved, can be elevated into\r\nland since Miocene or possibly Pliocene times, it is evident that the\r\ncrust-movements have been sufficient to produce the most profound\r\nchanges in the distribution of land and sea during the long ages which\r\nare known to us. Another argument against the occurrence of extensive\r\nchanges has been derived from an examination of those islands which\r\nare spoken of as oceanic islands. Strictly speaking an oceanic island\r\nis one in which the present fauna and flora give indications of their\r\nintroduction by transport across intervening sea, and no indications\r\nof the existence of forms of life which inhabited it when it was once\r\nunited to a continent; it may be inferred with a considerable degree\r\nof certainty that these islands have been isolated for long periods of\r\ntime. It has been stated that these oceanic islands never contain\r\nmarine sediments of any considerable degree of antiquity, and that\r\nthere are therefore no traces of former continents over those wide\r\ntracts of ocean which are occupied by oceanic islands. The evidence is\r\nof a negative character. The islands would be less likely to exhibit\r\nancient sediments than continents, for being near the ocean, they\r\nwould be readily submerged, and the older deposits masked by newer\r\nones, though this need not necessarily account for the entire absence\r\nof ancient rocks amongst them. The danger of the argument lies in the\r\nfact that we do not yet know how far these old rocks really are\r\nabsent, as the geology of the oceanic isles has not been fully\r\nexplored from this point of view, and already several cases of the\r\nasserted presence of ancient rocks on these islands have been\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: See Mr A. R. Wallace's _Island Life_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: See chapter IX.]\r\n\r\nThe argument derived from the present distribution of organisms is far\r\ntoo complex to be discussed here, and the student is recommended to\r\nread a masterly review of the evidence in Dr W. T. Blanford's\r\nPresidential Address to the Geological Society in 1890, on the\r\nquestion of the Permanence of Ocean Basins[123]. After reviewing the\r\nevidence furnished by a study of modern distribution he concludes that\r\nit \"is far too contradictory to be received as proof of the permanence\r\nof oceans and continents.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. XLVI., _Proc._, p.\r\n59.]\r\n\r\nThe existence of former extensive land tracts over regions now\r\noccupied by sea is naturally more difficult to prove than that of sea\r\nover land, as we depend upon inference rather than actual observation\r\nto a much greater degree than when considering the permanence of\r\ncontinents, nevertheless a considerable amount of indirect evidence in\r\nfavour of the existence of widespread land tracts over our present\r\nocean regions has been accumulated and will be briefly noticed. We may\r\ntake first the evidence derived from the nature of sediments, and\r\nafterwards that which has been acquired by studying distribution of\r\norganisms in past times.\r\n\r\nThe indications of existence of an extensive tract of continent over\r\nthe North Atlantic Ocean, during Palæozoic times have already been\r\nconsidered, and it was seen that the thinning out of the Palæozoic\r\nsediments when traced away from the present Atlantic borders in an\r\neasterly direction over Europe and in a westerly one over North\r\nAmerica pointed to the existence of this Palæozoic 'Atlantis,' as\r\nmaintained by Prof. Hull in his work, \"Contributions to the Physical\r\nHistory of the British Isles.\" This writer gives some reasons for\r\nsupposing that the continental mass began to break up towards the end\r\nof Palæozoic times, though it is not clear that complete replacement\r\nof land by sea occurred, and the nature of the Wealden deposits has\r\nbeen pointed to as evidence of the existence of an extensive tract of\r\nland to the west of Britain during the Cretaceous period.\r\n\r\nThe Palæontological evidence in favour of destruction of ancient\r\ncontinental areas and their replacement by the sea is more\r\nsatisfactory than that which is based on physical grounds. The\r\ndistribution of the Glossopteris flora of the Permo-Carboniferous\r\nperiod points to the former existence of a great southern continent,\r\nincluding the sites of Australia, India, South Africa and South\r\nAmerica,--the Gondwanaland of Prof. E. Suess[124].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: On this question and that of the other destroyed\r\ncontinental areas noted here, see W. T. Blanford's _Presidential\r\nAddress_, _loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nAgain, a study of Jurassic and Cretaceous faunas has led\r\npalæontologists to conclude that there was a connexion betwixt S.\r\nAfrica and India in Mesozoic times across a portion of the area now\r\noccupied by the Indian Ocean, and also between S. Africa and S.\r\nAmerica, and these inferences are supported by study of the\r\ndistribution of existing forms.\r\n\r\nThe sudden appearance of the Dicotyledonous Angiosperms in Upper\r\nCretaceous rocks has also been used as evidence of destruction of\r\nconsiderable tracts of land subsequently to Upper Cretaceous times,\r\nand there is a certain amount of evidence in favour of the existence\r\nof this land in the north polar region, in an area now largely\r\noccupied by water, though relics of it are left, as the Faroe Isles,\r\nSpitsbergen, Novaya Zembla and Franz Josef Land.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude the consideration of the question of permanence of\r\noceans and continents more fitly than by quoting from Dr Blanford's\r\naddress. He says, \"There is no evidence whatever in favour of the\r\nextreme view accepted by some physicists and geologists that every\r\nocean-bed now more than 1000 fathoms deep has always been ocean, and\r\nthat no part of the continental area has ever been beneath the deep\r\nsea. Not only is there clear proof that some land-areas lying within\r\ncontinental limits have at a comparatively recent date been submerged\r\nover 1000 fathoms, whilst sea-bottoms now over 1000 fathoms deep must\r\nhave been land in part of the Tertiary era, but there are a mass of\r\nfacts both geological and biological in favour of land-connexion\r\nhaving formerly existed in certain cases across what are now broad and\r\ndeep ocean[125].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: _Loc. cit._, _Proc._ p. 107.]\r\n\r\n_Growth of continents._ Whatever view as to the general permanence of\r\ncontinents and oceans be ultimately established, the occurrence of\r\nwidespread changes in the position of land and sea is indisputable,\r\nand it is of interest for us to consider the nature of these changes\r\nin the formation of continents. Prof. J. D. Dana has put forward a\r\nhypothesis of growth of continents by a process of accretion, causing\r\ndiminution in the oceanic areas, which at the same time became deeper:\r\nsuch growth need not always take place in exactly the same way, and\r\nstudy of the distribution of the strata of the North American\r\ncontinent suggests that the growth there was endogenous, the older\r\nrocks lying to the west and north forming a horseshoe shaped continent\r\nenclosing a gulf-like prolongation of the Atlantic, which became\r\ncontracted by deposition and uplift in successive geological periods,\r\nthough it is still partly existent as the Gulf of Mexico. The Eurasian\r\ncontinent, especially its western portion, suggests more irregular\r\ngrowth around scattered nuclei of older rocks, though the process is\r\nnot completed, and many gulf-like prolongations, as the Baltic and the\r\nMediterranean, still remain as water-tracts, which have not yet been\r\nadded to the continents.\r\n\r\nAlthough extensive additions to continents may be and no doubt are\r\noften largely due to epeirogenic movements, the influence of orogenic\r\nmovements on continent-formation is very pronounced. As the result of\r\norogenic movements, the rocks of portions of the earth's crust become\r\ngreatly compressed, and give rise to masses which readily resist\r\ndenudation; moreover, these comparatively rigid masses, as shown by M.\r\nBertrand, tend to undergo elevation along the same lines as those\r\nwhich formed the axes of previous elevations, and accordingly after a\r\ncontinental area has undergone denudation for a considerable period,\r\nthe uplands consist of rocks which have undergone orogenic\r\ndisturbance, while the tracts of ground which are occupied by rocks\r\nwhich have not suffered disturbances of this character, even if\r\noriginally uplifted far above sea-level, tend to be destroyed, and\r\nultimately occupied by tracts of ocean. Stumps of former mountain\r\nchains may be again and again established as nuclei of continents and\r\nas every period of orogenic movement will add to the number of these\r\nnuclei, the continental areas must in course of time become more\r\ncomplex in structure. Moreover, as some areas are affected by orogenic\r\nmovements to a greater extent than others, the complexity of different\r\ncontinental masses will vary. Thus, western Europe has been affected\r\nby orogenic movements during many periods since the commencement of\r\nCambrian times and its structure is extremely complex, while the\r\ncentral and western parts of Russia have not been subjected to violent\r\norogenic disturbances since Cambrian times, and accordingly we find\r\nthe structure of that area comparatively simple; the greater part of\r\nAfrica seems to have escaped these movements since remote times, and\r\nthe structure of that continent is extremely simple when compared with\r\nthe Eurasian continental tract. It need hardly be stated that the\r\nformation of extensive chains composed of volcanic material, by\r\naccumulation of lavas and ashes on the earth's surface, may give and\r\noften has given rise to more rigid tracts, which will bring about the\r\nsame effects as those produced by orogenic disturbance as illustrated\r\non a small scale by the Lower Palæozoic volcanic rocks of Cambria and\r\nCumbria.\r\n\r\n_Uniformitarianism and Evolution._ According to the extreme\r\nuniformitarian views held by some geologists, the agents which are in\r\noperation at the present day are similar in kind and in intensity to\r\nthose which were at work in past times, though no geologist will be\r\nfound who is sufficiently bold to assert that this holds true for all\r\nperiods of the earth's history, but only for those of which the\r\ngeologist has direct information derived from a study of the rocks,\r\nand he is content to follow his master Hutton in ignoring periods of\r\nwhich he cannot find records amongst the rocks. The modern geologist,\r\nhowever, while rightly regarding the rocks as his principal source of\r\ninformation finds that he cannot afford to ignore the evidence\r\nfurnished by the physicist, chemist, astronomer and biologist, which\r\nthrows light upon the history of periods far earlier than those of\r\nwhich he has any records preserved amongst the outer portions of the\r\nearth itself, just as the modern historian is not content with written\r\nrecords, but must turn to the 'prehistoric' archæologist and geologist\r\nfor information concerning the history of early man upon the earth.\r\nInterpreting the scope of geology in this general way, rigid\r\nuniformitarianism must be abandoned. Assuming that the tenets of the\r\nevolutionist school are generally true, the question is, how far does\r\nthis affect the geologist in his study of those periods of which we\r\nhave definite records amongst the rocks? This is a question which\r\ncannot readily be answered at the present day, for our study of the\r\nrocks is not sufficiently far advanced to enable us to point out\r\neffects amongst the older rocks which were clearly caused by agents\r\nworking with greater intensity than they do at present, but as, on\r\nthe other hand, we cannot prove that these effects are due to agents\r\nworking with no greater intensity than that which now marks these\r\noperations, it is unphilosophical to assume the latter. No student of\r\nscience at the present day would state that because there has been no\r\nobserved case of incoming of fresh species within the time that man\r\nhas actually observed the present faunas and floras, the hypothesis of\r\nevolution of organisms is disproved, for the time of observation has\r\nbeen too short, and similarly the time which has elapsed since the\r\nformation of, say, the Cambrian rocks may have been too short, as\r\ncompared with the time which has elapsed since the formation of the\r\nearth, to allow of any important change in the operation of the\r\ngeological agents.\r\n\r\nLeaving out of account, for the moment, the actual evidence which has\r\nbeen derived from a study of the rocks, we may briefly consider the\r\ntheoretical grounds upon which the substitution of an evolutionist\r\nschool of geology for one of uniformity has been suggested[126]. The\r\nprincipal sources of energy which have exerted an influence upon\r\ngeological changes are the heat received from the sun and that given\r\noff from the earth itself, both of which must have diminished in\r\nquantity throughout geological ages. To the former source we largely\r\nowe climatic changes and the operations of denudation, and accordingly\r\nof deposition; to the latter, those of earth-movement and vulcanicity.\r\nIt by no means follows that because the agents were once potentially\r\nmore powerful than now, they would necessarily produce greater\r\neffects, for that depends to some extent upon the various conditions\r\nwhich prevailed at different times. To give an example:--if there had\r\nat any time been a universal ocean of considerable depth, however\r\nactive the agents of denudation were then, they could produce no\r\neffect whatever, having nothing to work upon; to take a less extreme\r\ncase, if our continents at any past time were smaller and less\r\nelevated than at present, agents of denudation working with greater\r\nintensity than that of the present agents need not necessarily have\r\nproduced a greater amount of denudation than that which is going on at\r\nthe present day. Again, let us consider vulcanicity: \"It is as\r\ncertain,\" says Lord Kelvin, \"that there is less volcanic energy in the\r\nwhole earth than there was a thousand years ago, as it is that there\r\nis less gunpowder in a 'Monitor' after she has been seen to discharge\r\nshot and shell, whether at a nearly equable rate or not, for five\r\nhours without receiving fresh supplies than there was at the beginning\r\nof the action.\" But it does not follow that the manifestations of\r\nvolcanic activity were necessarily more violent in early geological\r\ntimes than now, for the degree of violence would be affected by other\r\nthings than the volcanic energy, such as the thickness of the earth's\r\ncrust.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: The student may consult an interesting article by Prof.\r\nSollas bearing on this subject. See _Geol. Mag._ Dec. 2, vol. IV. p.\r\n1.]\r\n\r\nAnd now, let us consider briefly the characters of the rocks of the\r\ncrust, to see if they throw any light upon this question. The earliest\r\nsediments of which we have any certain knowledge resemble in a\r\nstriking manner those formed at the present day, and they seem to have\r\nbeen formed under very much the same conditions, though further work\r\nmay show that there were somewhat different conditions which did\r\nproduce definite differences in the characters of the earlier\r\nstrata[127]. Our knowledge of earth-movement and vulcanicity which\r\ntook place in past times is still too small to enable us to draw any\r\ncertain conclusions connected with the subject under discussion from\r\nit. Perhaps the most suggestive indication of one set of conditions\r\nhaving been generally similar in those early periods of which we have\r\ndefinite records amongst the rocks is furnished by study of past\r\nclimate. If we accept the nebular hypothesis as a starting point, we\r\nmust admit that in the early stages of the earth's history the\r\ntemperature of the surface, which would then be largely dependent upon\r\nthe amount of heat given out from the earth itself as well as upon\r\nthat received from the sun, must have been much higher than it is at\r\nthe present day, and indeed the mere diminution of the amount of heat\r\nreceived from the sun would probably be sufficient to account for a\r\nvery marked lowering of the temperature. Besides this change of\r\ntemperature, resulting in gradual lowering of temperature over the\r\nwhole earth's surface, we have other changes dependent upon different\r\nconditions, as proved by the fact, that there have been alternations\r\nof glacial and genial periods. If the general temperature had been\r\nvery high in the early periods of which we have actual records, the\r\noscillations would not be sufficient to produce a lowering of\r\ntemperature sufficient to cause glacial periods, whereas if it had not\r\nbeen appreciably higher than now, glacial periods might be produced.\r\nThis may be represented diagrammatically.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: On this matter see Teall, J. J. H., 'Presidential\r\nAddress to Section C,' _Report of the British Association_, 1893.]\r\n\r\nLet _a_ represent the temperature at the commencement of earth-history\r\nand _b_ that necessary for glaciation, and _bc_ the lapse of time\r\nbetween then and now. The curved line indicates the gradual fall in\r\ntemperature due to diminution of the amount of heat, while the zigzag\r\nline represents the oscillations due to secular climatic changes. If\r\nthe Cambrian period x occurred comparatively soon after the\r\ncommencement of earth-history as shown in fig. _A_, no glaciation\r\ncould be produced, even during periods when secular changes caused\r\ncolder conditions than the mean, whereas if the Cambrian period\r\noccurred at a time very remote from the commencement of earth-history\r\nas shown in _B_, glacial conditions could be produced then as now, for\r\nthe mean temperature, as shown by the distance of the curve from the\r\nline _bc_, would be practically as it now is. The studies of the last\r\nfew decades have brought into prominence the occurrence of glacial\r\nperiods in remote times, probably in early Palæozoic times; and as far\r\nas the mean temperature of the earth's surface is concerned, it would\r\nappear, from the knowledge in our possession, that matters were not\r\nvery different in those early times from what they now are.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.]\r\n\r\nSome further remarks will be made in subsequent paragraphs concerning\r\nthe period of the earth's history at which the geologist is first\r\nfurnished with definite records, but in the meantime it may be\r\nobserved that the geologist will do well, when working amongst the\r\nstrata, to consider that the more active operation of agents, even in\r\ntimes of which he has definite knowledge, may have produced effects\r\nwhich he should be prepared to discover, as their discovery would be\r\nof considerable importance, and that he should not be content to infer\r\nthat because it has been proved that agents operating with the same\r\nintensity as that which they have at present, _may_ have produced all\r\nthe effects which he can actually observe, they therefore necessarily\r\n_did_ produce them.\r\n\r\n_Recurrences._ Absolute uniformity of conditions is impossible, even\r\nin a single area. Every change which takes place upon the earth\r\nproduces conditions somewhat dissimilar from those which previously\r\nexisted, and these will leave their effects upon the physiography of\r\nthe area. For this reason, assuming that the conditions have gradually\r\nchanged from simpler to more complex, every period of time will have\r\nbeen marked by conditions which never prevailed before or afterwards,\r\nand these will leave their impress upon the deposits of the period. It\r\nis doubtful for instance, as already remarked, whether the exact\r\nconditions which gave rise to the extensive deposits of vegetable\r\nmatter in Carboniferous times which now form coal, ever occurred to a\r\nlike extent in previous or subsequent periods, and accordingly, though\r\nwe have deposits of coal of other ages, none are so extensive as those\r\nof the Coal Measures. Again, as the strata of one period are largely\r\ncomposed of denuded particles of pre-existing strata, which were\r\nderived directly or indirectly from igneous rock, the soluble material\r\nexisting in the igneous rocks must have been gradually eliminated\r\nunless restored by other processes, and we might expect to find that\r\nearly sediments have, on the whole, a larger proportion of soluble\r\nsilicates than the later ones.\r\n\r\nBesides these changes, there are physical changes which are recurrent,\r\nand cause conditions generally similar to pre-existing ones to occur\r\nin an area after an interval of dissimilar ones. We have seen that\r\ndeposits tend to vary according to the distance from the coast,\r\nlimestone being succeeded by mud, this by sand and gravel, and after\r\nsubsidence the sand and gravel are succeeded by mud, and that by\r\nlimestone. These changes will produce some effect upon the organisms,\r\nand the recurrence of organisms is a well-known event, of which cases\r\nhave been cited in a former chapter.\r\n\r\nAgain we find, as already pointed out, recurrence of climatic changes,\r\nwith alternation of glacial and warmer periods, and these may have\r\nbeen very widespread, and would influence the other physical\r\nconditions, as well as the distribution of the organisms. Vulcanicity\r\nmay have been more rife at some periods than others, for instance\r\nthere seems, in the present imperfect state of our knowledge, evidence\r\nof enfeebled vulcanicity in later Mesozoic times, and of its renewed\r\nactivity in Tertiary times. Again, orogenic movements seem to have\r\noccurred more extensively at some times than others, as for instance\r\nin early upper Palæozoic times, at the end of the Palæozoic epoch, and\r\nin early Tertiary times, though this may also be an apparent and not\r\nan actual truth, due to imperfect knowledge. In any case, in limited\r\nareas, there seem to have been alternations of periods of uplift\r\naccompanied by marked orogenic movements, and of widespread\r\ndepression, accompanied by sedimentation.\r\n\r\nThe subject of rhythmic recurrence is worthy of further study. This\r\nrecurrence in combination with evolutionary change may account for the\r\napparent marked difference between Cambrian and Precambrian times, a\r\ndifference which strikes some geologists as being too great to be\r\naccounted for as due to our ignorance only.\r\n\r\n_Organic evolution._ This subject is too wide for more than passing\r\nnotice in a work of this character. The evidence of Palæontology is of\r\nextreme importance to the biologist, and indeed, the way in which\r\nevolution of organisms has occurred can only be actually demonstrated\r\nby reference to Palæontology, and the study of Palæontology has\r\nalready given much information concerning the lines on which evolution\r\nhas proceeded in different groups of organisms. It must be remembered\r\nthat the major divisions of the invertebrata were in existence in very\r\nearly times; indeed representatives of most of them are found in the\r\nrocks containing the earliest known fauna, that of the _Olenellus_\r\nbeds of Cambrian age. If our present views as to evolution be correct,\r\nthere is no doubt that the period which elapsed between the appearance\r\nof life upon the globe and the existence of the _Olenellus_ fauna must\r\nhave been very great, possibly, as Huxley suggested, much greater than\r\nthat which has elapsed between early Cambrian times and the present\r\nday. If this be so, however probable it is that we shall carry our\r\nknowledge of ancient faunas far back beyond Cambrian times, it is\r\nextremely improbable that we shall ever get traces of the very\r\nearliest faunas which occupied our earth.\r\n\r\n_Geological time._ Various attempts have been made to give numerical\r\nestimates of the lapse of time which occurred since the earth was\r\nformed, or since the earliest known rocks were deposited. These\r\nattempts may be classed under two heads, namely, those made by\r\nphysicists, mainly on evidence obtained otherwise than by a study of\r\nthe rocks, and those made by geologists by calculating the mean rate\r\nof denudation and deposition of the rocks, and estimating the average\r\nthickness of the rocks of the geological column.\r\n\r\nThe calculations of physicists as to the age of the earth vary:--Lord\r\nKelvin assigned 20,000,000 years as the minimum and 100,000,000 as the\r\nmaximum duration of geological time. Prof. Tait has halved Lord\r\nKelvin's minimum period, while Prof. G. Darwin admits the possibility\r\nof the lapse of 500,000,000 years.\r\n\r\nThe estimates made by geologists, which will appeal more directly to\r\nthe geological student, also vary considerably, though they bear some\r\nproportion to those which have been put forward by the physicists.\r\nProf. S. Haughton[128] assigned a period of 200,000,000 years for the\r\naccumulation of the rocks of the geological column; Mr Clifton\r\nWard[129] one of 62,000,000 years, after studying the rocks of the\r\nEnglish Lake District, and allowing for the gaps in the succession; Mr\r\nA. R. Wallace[130] further lowers the time for the formation of the\r\ncolumn to 28,000,000 years; Sir A. Geikie[131] gives 73,000,000 years\r\nas the minimum and 680,000,000 as the maximum; while Mr J. G.\r\nGoodchild has lately[132] estimated the period at over 700,000,000\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: _Nature_, vol. XVIII. p. 268.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: Ward, J. C., 'The Physical History of the English Lake\r\nDistrict,' _Geol. Mag._ Dec 2, vol. VI. p. 110.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: Wallace, A. R., _Island Life_, Chap. X.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: Geikie, Sir A., 'Presidential Address to the British\r\nAssociation,' _Report Brit. Assoc._, 1892.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: Goodchild, J. G., _Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh_, vol.\r\nXIII. p. 259.]\r\n\r\nInteresting as these figures are, they probably convey little to the\r\nordinary reader, and it is doubtful whether the geologist is really\r\naffected by them to any extent when picturing to himself the vast\r\nduration of geological time. One numerical estimate probably does\r\nimpress him, namely that made by Croll as to the date of the Great Ice\r\nAge, for if the Ice Age be so remote as Croll imagined, the\r\ncommencement of earth-history must be inconceivably more remote; as\r\nCroll's estimate is not generally accepted, it is doubtful how far\r\ngeologists are thus influenced, and probably the fact which does\r\nimpress them most, leaving fossils out of account, is the very little\r\nchange which has occurred in historic or even in prehistoric times as\r\ncompared with the vast changes which are familiar to them after\r\nstudying the strata of the geological column.\r\n\r\nIt is, after all, the succession of varied faunas which really gives\r\nstudents of the rocks the most convincing proof of the vast periods of\r\ngeological time. If anyone doubts this assertion, let him consider\r\nwhat impression would be made upon him by observing the several\r\nthousand feet of strata of the column if none of them contained any\r\norganisms. Cognisant as he is of the slow rate of change of existing\r\norganisms, the fact that fauna has succeeded fauna in past times\r\nbrings home to him in an unmistakeable manner the great antiquity of\r\nthe earliest fossiliferous rocks, and as our detailed knowledge of\r\nthese faunas increases the impression of great lapse of time is\r\nintensified. And if the earliest fossiliferous rocks be of such vast\r\nantiquity, and, as has been remarked, the period of their formation is\r\ncomparatively recent with reference to the actual commencement of\r\nearth-history, the latter must indeed be inconceivably remote, and\r\nnumerical estimates can do but little to familiarise us with the\r\nsignificance of the vast time which has rolled by since the world's\r\nbirthday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abraum salts, 212\r\n  Æolian rocks, 24, 99, 100\r\n  Age, definition of, 60\r\n  Albian series, 236, 238\r\n  Algonkian rocks, 144\r\n  Ampthill clay, 232\r\n  Angelin, N.

Mindful, however, of the geological side of\r\nthe subject, he has introduced a chapter on the succession of the\r\nvertebrate faunas, offering a brief but convenient summary of the\r\ndistribution of vertebrate life throughout geologic time.

There is much in Cambridgeshire geology to\r\narouse interest when once an enthusiasm for the science has been\r\nkindled, and there was need of a concise hand-book which should\r\nclearly describe and explain the leading facts that have been made\r\nknown.... The present work is a model of what a county geology should\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n     =The Principles of Stratigraphical Geology.= By J. E. Marr,\r\n     M.A., Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge. Crown 8vo.\r\n     6_s._\r\n\r\n_Nature._ The work will prove exceedingly useful to the advanced\r\nstudent; it is full of hints and references, gathered during the\r\nauthor's long experience as a teacher and observer, and which will be\r\nvaluable to all who seek to interpret the history of our stratified\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n_University Extension Journal._ Mr Marr is an old University Extension\r\nlecturer, and his book, which is distinguished by the lucidity and\r\nthoroughness which characterise all his work, cannot fail to be of\r\nservice to University Extension students who are making a serious\r\nstudy of Geology.\r\n\r\n     =Crystallography.= By W. J. Lewis, M.A., Professor of\r\n     Mineralogy in the University of Cambridge. Demy 8vo. 14_s._\r\n     net.\r\n\r\n_Athenæum._ Prof. Lewis has written a valuable work.... The present\r\nwork deserves to be welcomed not only as a greatly needed help to\r\nadvanced students of mineralogy, but as a sign that the study itself\r\nmaintains an honoured place in the university Science Course.\r\n\r\n_Nature._ The author and the University Press may be congratulated on\r\nthe completion of a treatise worthy of the subject and of the\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n     =Petrology for Students.= An Introduction to the Study of\r\n     Rocks under the Microscope. By A. Harker, M.A., F.G.S.,\r\n     Fellow of St John's College, and Demonstrator in Geology\r\n     (Petrology) in the University of Cambridge. Crown 8vo. Second\r\n     Edition, Revised. 7_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n_Nature._ No better introduction to the study of petrology could be\r\ndesired than is afforded by Mr Harker's volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n  London: C. J.
