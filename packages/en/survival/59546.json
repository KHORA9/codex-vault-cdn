Producers should endeavor\r\nto make turkey raising more profitable by overcoming heavy losses from\r\ndiseases that heretofore have been a serious handicap.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise is very adaptable, extending to practically all parts of\r\nthe United States. The more important areas of production are the Middle\r\nWestern, Northwestern, and Southwestern States, where large numbers of\r\nsmall flocks are raised annually on farms and ranches and where there are\r\nalso many large commercial flocks. The number of turkeys in this country\r\nbegan to decrease about 1890, but by 1910 interest in turkey raising\r\nrevived, and in recent years the industry has been growing, largely\r\nbecause of increased knowledge of blackhead disease and its control.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census there were 3,688,000 turkeys on farms in the\r\nUnited States in 1910 and about the same number in 1920. The 1930 census\r\nshowed 16,794,000 turkeys, but this was the number raised to market age\r\ninstead of the number of breeding turkeys kept. This new census figure\r\nprovides a much better measure of the industry's actual size. The 1930\r\nfigure indicates a moderate increase between 1920 and 1930 in the number\r\nof breeding turkeys kept. The nine States leading in turkey production,\r\nas shown by the 1930 census, are Texas, North Dakota, Minnesota,\r\nCalifornia, Oklahoma, Oregon, Colorado, Virginia, and Idaho.\r\n\r\nWhere conditions are suitable and proper methods of management are\r\nfollowed turkeys can be raised successfully with very simple equipment;\r\ntherefore the capital outlay in the enterprise may be quite small. Except\r\nduring the growing season managing the flock is fairly simple. Of course,\r\nconstitutional vigor must be maintained in the breeding stock; the flock\r\nmust be kept relatively free from disease; and the soil, especially where\r\nthe poults are fed, must be kept sanitary. Moreover, turkeys, even when\r\nveil fed, will make good use of at least a limited range and in doing so\r\nwill destroy many injurious insects, eat great quantities of succulent\r\ngreen feed, and pick up much waste grain, weed seeds, and other sources\r\nof nutriment. This fact reduces the cost of production and increases the\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1.--Bronze turkey, male.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETIES\r\n\r\n\r\nAll domestic varieties of turkeys have descended from the North American\r\nwild stock, comprising the eastern wild turkey, which ranged over the\r\neastern part of the United States from Maine to Florida; the Florida\r\nwild turkey, which ranged over southern Florida; the Rio Grande wild\r\nturkey, which ranged over southern Texas and northwestern Mexico; and\r\nthe Mexican wild turkey, which ranged over Arizona, western New Mexico,\r\nsouthern Colorado, and Mexico. It is probable, however, that these four\r\nwild turkeys were of common origin and that most of our domesticated\r\nvarieties, especially the Bronze, have descended from the Mexican wild\r\nturkey.\r\n\r\nSix standard varieties of domestic turkeys are recognized by the American\r\nPoultry Association, an organization having as its primary function the\r\npromotion of standard qualities in all breeds and varieties of poultry\r\nin North America. The association publishes the Standard of Perfection,\r\nwhich contains concise descriptions of breeds and varieties of poultry,\r\nwith illustrations of the most important ones.\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief description of each of the six varieties,\r\nnamely, the Bronze, White Holland, Bourbon Red, Narragansett, Black, and\r\nSlate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--Bronze turkey, female.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRONZE\r\n\r\nThe Bronze, often called the Mammoth Bronze, is the heaviest and also\r\nthe most popular variety. The male (fig. 1) is distinguished by (1) the\r\nrich, iridescent, red-green sheen of the plumage on the neck, wing bows,\r\nwing fronts, wing coverts, breast, front half of the back, and lower\r\nthighs; and (2) the lighter, brilliant, copper-colored bronzing of the\r\nrear half of the back, tail coverts, tail itself, and body. The bronzing\r\nin the tail, tail coverts, and body is bordered by a distinct narrow\r\nblack band, which in turn is bordered by a wide edging of pure white.\r\nThe rear portion of the back has the broad bronze bar with the narrow\r\nedging of black but does not have the white tips. The plumage of the\r\nfemale (fig. 2) is similar to that of the male, except for an edging of\r\nwhite on the black bars on the back, wing bows, wing coverts, breast, and\r\nbody. This white edging is narrow in the front of the body and gradually\r\nwidens toward the rear. Both sexes have the same color pattern in the\r\nlarge wing feathers and in the main tail feathers and coverts. The main\r\ntail feathers and coverts have brown penciling (narrow bars) on a dull\r\nblack background; the large wing feathers are evenly barred with black\r\nand white, the bars of the secondaries becoming indistinct as the back\r\nis approached. Creaminess, yellow, or yellowish brown in the pure white\r\nedging of the main tail feathers and coverts of the Bronze indicates\r\nan admixture of wild-turkey blood and is a serious defect in the\r\nstandardbred Bronze. Lack of the copper-colored bronzing or a tendency\r\nfor it to be greenish is also a serious color defect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE HOLLAND\r\n\r\nThe White Holland (fig. 3) probably originated as a \"sport\" from the\r\nBronze or the wild turkey. Its plumage should be pure white in color and\r\nfree in all sections from black flecking or ticking. The shanks and toes\r\nin this variety should be pinkish white.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOURBON RED\r\n\r\nThe Bourbon Red male (fig. 4) is of a rich, deep brownish-red color\r\nin all sections except the wings, tail, and breast. The primaries and\r\nsecondaries of the wings are pure white, and the main tail feathers are\r\npure white except for an indistinct bar of red crossing each feather near\r\nthe end. The breast feathers are red with a very narrow edging of black.\r\nThe color of the female is similar to that of the male, but there is a\r\nvery narrow edging of white on the tips of the breast feathers. More than\r\none-third of any other color except white showing in the large feathers\r\nof the wing or tail constitutes a standard disqualification in this\r\nvariety. The rich reddish color, without some black, is rather difficult\r\nto obtain and this black ticking or flecking is a rather common fault. A\r\nfaded red, approaching buff, is also undesirable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--White Holland turkey, male.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NARRAGANSETT\r\n\r\nThe Narragansett (fig. 5) generally resembles the Bronze in color\r\npattern, but has no iridescent red-green sheen and no bronzing. The\r\nNarragansett colors are metallic black with light steel-gray edging and\r\nbarring bordered, in certain sections, by a narrow black band on the\r\nend of the feathers. The plumage, as a whole, has a dark background of\r\nmetallic black with a broad, light steel-gray edging, showing more of\r\nthe light color in this edging as the body is approached. In the male,\r\nthe colors of the wing fronts, wing bows, and wing coverts are the\r\nreverse of the colors found elsewhere, being light steel gray, ending\r\nin a narrow band of black. The wing coverts form a broad silvery bar\r\nacross the folded wings. The neck and saddle are black, ending in a broad\r\nsteel-gray band. The back is rich metallic black, free from bronzing.\r\nThe breast, body, and fluff are black, the feathers ending in a broad\r\nsilvery-gray band edged with black. The large wing and tail feathers and\r\nthe primary coverts are barred with black and white similarly to those of\r\nthe Bronze, the barring of the upper secondaries becoming indistinct as\r\nthe back is approached.\r\n\r\nThe plumage of the female is similar to that of the male in this variety,\r\nexcept that an extra edging of silvery gray is added to the ends of the\r\nfeathers on the back, wing bows, wing coverts, breast, and body. The\r\nlight edging should be narrow toward the front of the bird and broader\r\ntoward the rear. The female in general presents a lighter appearance than\r\nthe male. There should be a rich metallic black but no bronze barring\r\nin either sex. The offspring of a Narragansett mating sometimes have a\r\nbronze color, but such birds should not be kept for breeders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--Bourbon Red turkey, male.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK\r\n\r\nThe Black (fig. 6), known in England as the Norfolk turkey, is lustrous\r\ngreenish black in all sections of the plumage. Objectionable white\r\ntipping in the feathers of young turkeys of this variety often disappears\r\nafter the first molt. Any variation from the solid black color should be\r\ncarefully avoided in breeding this variety. The shanks and toes should be\r\npink in mature birds and almost black in young birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLATE\r\n\r\nThe Slate (fig. 7) has an ashy-blue or slate-colored plumage, sometimes\r\ndotted with tiny black spots, which are undesirable. Feathers of\r\nany other color, such as white, buff, or red, constitute a standard\r\ndisqualification. This variety does not breed true to color, and many\r\nof the offspring have both solid white and solid black as well as\r\nblack-and-white ticking and splashing. The shanks and toes should be pink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD WEIGHTS OF TURKEYS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe standard weights of the different varieties of turkeys as given in\r\nthe Standard of Perfection are given in table 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1.--Standard weights of turkeys at various ages\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-----------+----------+-----------+---------+----------\r\n                 |           | Yearling |           |         |\r\n                 | Adult     | cock (1  | Cockerel  | Hen     | Pullet\r\n     Variety     | cock (2   | year old | (less     | (1 year | (less\r\n                 | years old | and less | than 1    | old or  | than 1\r\n                 | or over)  | than 2)  | year old) | over)   | year old)\r\n  ---------------+-----------+----------+-----------+---------+----------\r\n                 | _Pounds_  | _Pounds_ | _Pounds_  |_Pounds_ | _Pounds_\r\n  Bronze         |    36     |    33    |    25     |   20    |    16\r\n  White Holland  |    33     |    30    |    23     |   18    |    14\r\n  Bourbon Red    |    33     |    30    |    23     |   18    |    14\r\n  Narragansett   |    33     |    30    |    23     |   18    |    14\r\n  Black          |    33     |    30    |    23     |   18    |    14\r\n  Slate          |    33     |    30    |    23     |   18    |    14\r\n  ---------------+-----------+----------+-----------+---------+----------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--Narragansett turkey, female.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTING BREEDING STOCK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe breeding stock is the foundation of the turkey industry, and the\r\ngreatest care must be used in selecting both male and female breeders.\r\nFailure in this respect has undoubtedly been one of the principal\r\nreasons why satisfactory results have not been obtained on many farms\r\nand commercial plants. One of the first steps in improving conditions,\r\ntherefore, is more careful selection of the breeding stock.\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory time of the year to select breeding stock is in\r\nNovember or December, especially before large numbers of turkeys are\r\nsold for the Thanksgiving and Christmas markets. Selecting birds early\r\nin the season makes possible a choice from a larger number and, what is\r\nmore important, saves the best-developed and most vigorous birds for\r\nbreeding instead of marketing them. New blood may be introduced into the\r\nflock or a beginning with turkeys may be made by obtaining hatching eggs,\r\nday-old poults, or breeding stock, but the purchase of eggs or poults is\r\nrecommended. New breeding stock should be treated for worms and lice and\r\nshould be quarantined for 2 or 3 weeks to detect any disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--Black turkey, male.]\r\n\r\nTurkeys are raised for meat rather than for egg production. The breeders,\r\ntherefore, should have compact, meaty bodies. The breastbone should be\r\nstraight, the back broad, especially at the shoulders, and the breadth\r\ncarried well back toward the tail. The body should be deep, with the\r\nbreast so broad, full, and well rounded that the breastbone does not\r\nprotrude prominently. Other important points are full, bright eyes, a\r\nbroad head, and stout legs set well apart and rather short. Above all\r\nelse, the birds should be vigorous. When, pedigrees and performance\r\nrecords of the birds' ancestors are available, selection should be\r\nbased on fertility, hatchability, livability, early maturity, and other\r\ndesirable factors, as well as on the physical points mentioned above.\r\n\r\nIt is wise to select or build up a flock of purebred turkeys. It costs\r\nno more to raise purebred stock than mongrels and the purebreds are\r\nusually heavier and command higher market prices. Also, if good standard\r\nqualities of shape and color are maintained, some of the birds can be\r\nsold for breeding purposes at increased prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANAGING BREEDING STOCK\r\n\r\n\r\nResults in turkey raising depend to a large extent on the kind of\r\nbreeding stock used each year and the manner in which it is managed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREEDING PENS OR ENCLOSURES\r\n\r\nUntil a few years ago breeding flocks were ordinarily allowed free\r\nrange throughout the breeding and laying season (fig. 8). This practice\r\noften gives unsatisfactory results because the nests cannot be found\r\nreadily and therefore the eggs cannot be gathered daily. Many breeding\r\nflocks are now kept in good-sized breeding pens or enclosures with\r\nnests conveniently located inside or outside the roosting shed (fig.\r\n9). For a pen of 12 to 18 birds a yard of 10 to 15 square rods is large\r\nenough. Frequently an orchard is very satisfactory. A hog-proof fence\r\nabout 6 feet high will confine the turkeys; they are not likely to fly\r\nover the fence, because they cannot rest on the top wire. Fences should\r\nbe tightly stretched and should be dog-proof, because dogs and coyotes\r\nare very destructive in turkey flocks. Solid-top fences, gates, and\r\nbuildings less than 9 feet high should be topped with strips of poultry\r\nfence 3 feet wide to prevent turkeys from perching on them. If turkey\r\nhens persist in flying over the fence the flight feathers of one wing\r\nmay be cut, but the wing of a breeding male should never be clipped, as\r\nthe clipping may interfere with mating.\r\n\r\nSanitation in the breeding yards must not be neglected. Either the fences\r\nand shelters should be made portable and moved each year to clean ground,\r\nor double yards should be constructed for use only in the breeding\r\nseason, during which time one yard is occupied for 2 successive weeks and\r\nthen the other, which in the meantime has been kept free of all poultry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--Slate turkey, male.]\r\n\r\nIf two or more breeding pens are maintained, they must be isolated from\r\neach other. This can be done with double fences, 12 feet or more apart,\r\nor with single fences built solid for about 3 feet above the ground, so\r\nthat the turkeys cannot see those in other pens.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATING\r\n\r\nBest results in mating are obtained when from 10 to 15 females are mated\r\nto 1 male, although as many as 18 hens can be mated to 1 young tom under\r\nfavorable conditions. As a rule good fertility will result when several\r\ntoms are kept with a flock of hens. However, if the toms are quarrelsome\r\nand mating is seriously interfered with the males must be alternated, 1\r\ntom being allowed to run with the hens 1 day and another tom the next\r\nday. Surplus toms should be penned out of sight of the breeding birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--Breeding flock of Bronze turkeys on\r\nfree range.]\r\n\r\nThe soundest breeding program is one of using yearlings and 2-year-old\r\nhens which have been selected as breeders alter they have passed through\r\none full breeding season successfully. However, if pedigreeing can\r\nbe done, it is practicable to use well-matured pullets selected from\r\nparents that lived through their first breeding season and showed good\r\nproduction, fertility, hatchability, and poult livability. The breeding\r\nmales may be young or old but, in general, well-matured young toms give\r\nbetter results. Proved sires, of course, are valuable and can well be\r\nused so long as they will breed. Reserve breeding toms should always be\r\nkept, especially when older toms are used, as the latter are sometimes\r\nsterile. The spurs of a yearling or older tom should be trimmed smooth,\r\nas should the toe-nails of all breeding males, regardless of age, to\r\navoid needless tearing of the backs of the females.\r\n\r\nAll breeding hens and toms that are not to be used for another breeding\r\nseason should be marketed about June 1. If older hens are used in\r\nbreeding, it is advisable to replace 3-year-old females with young birds,\r\nsince egg production decreases rapidly after that age. Immature stock\r\nshould never be used but, as mentioned before, well-matured young toms\r\nand pullets make good breeders especially if trap nesting and pedigreeing\r\ncan be carried on, thus enabling the breeder to cull properly and sell\r\nas market birds the offspring of all hens that die during their first\r\nlaying season.\r\n\r\nIt is not advisable for the average producer to inbreed turkeys, as this\r\npractice has been found to lower the vitality of the stock. When only one\r\nbreeding pen or flock is kept, it is advisable to obtain new blood every\r\nseason from a reliable outside source.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGG PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe time of year at which turkeys naturally lay depends largely on the\r\nclimate of the region in which they are raised, being earliest in the\r\nSouth. However, climate need not be permitted to hold back egg production\r\nas artificial light can be used to obtain early eggs, as with chickens.\r\nSoon after mating begins, the female looks for a nesting place, and\r\nabout 10 days after the first mating she begins to lay. One nest should\r\nbe provided for every 3 or 4 hens. The number of eggs produced per bird\r\ndepends on the breeding of the stock as well as on management. Under\r\nordinary circumstances in the Northern States, young turkey hens should\r\naverage 35 to 40 eggs and yearling hens 25 to 30 eggs each during the\r\nnormal breeding season if they are broken up whenever broodiness occurs.\r\nBy normal breeding season is meant the time between the date the first\r\negg is laid (late in the winter or early in the spring) and June 1. If\r\nartificial lights are used, starting about February 5, the breeders\r\nshould average 50 to 55 eggs each, or an increase of about 15 eggs by\r\nJune 1, due to the lighting. A few turkey raisers have used lights in\r\nDecember or January, thereby securing very early hatched turkeys and\r\nfurther increasing turkey-egg production.\r\n\r\nTurkeys are not extensively trap-nested, but the practice is carried\r\non by producers who wish to pedigree the poults and carry on selective\r\nbreeding. One trap nest is needed for each two hens. The hens should have\r\nfree access to the trap nests before they start to lay, and they should\r\nbe carefully watched to see that they do not lay their eggs anywhere\r\nexcept in the trap nests. Secluded places in the house or yard should\r\nbe eliminated. A simple form of trap nest is illustrated in figure 9.\r\nThe turkey enters at the front, through the trap door, which closes\r\nautomatically when the turkey is inside. The door at the top of the coop\r\nis opened to release the bird from the nest.\r\n\r\nWhen incubators or chicken hens are used to hatch the eggs, the turkey\r\nhens may be broken of their broodiness so that they will continue laying.\r\nBreaking the hens of broodiness by confining them to a wire-floored\r\ncoop is very desirable because it permits the hatching of a relatively\r\nlarge number of early turkeys and a larger number from each hen. The\r\nbirds hatched no later than June are the ones that grow and mature most\r\nsatisfactorily and therefore attain the best size for the Thanksgiving\r\nand Christmas markets. Early hatched birds should be marketed at\r\nThanksgiving or before, and those of later hatches can be used to supply\r\nthe Christmas and New Year demand. There is some demand for freshly\r\ndressed turkeys at all times of the year. To meet this demand turkeys\r\nmay be hatched from eggs laid during summer and fall. By the use of\r\nartificial light and proper feeds, hatchable eggs can be produced in the\r\nwinter and early in the spring.\r\n\r\nIt is natural for turkey hens to seek secluded places to lay their\r\neggs. Yards that have comparatively short vegetation and are free from\r\nbushes or other places of concealment are best, because such conditions\r\ndiscourage the birds from laying outside the nests provided for them. A\r\nlookout for hidden nests must be maintained, otherwise eggs may not be\r\ncollected regularly and may be frozen, partly incubated, or destroyed by\r\nanimals. Sometimes the hidden nests can be found by watching the turkey\r\nhens carefully as they make their way to them, but an easier and quicker\r\nmethod is to confine the hens early some morning soon after they come\r\nfrom the roosts and then let them out about 2 p. m.; the laying hens\r\nwill make straight for their nests in order to lay the eggs they have\r\nbeen holding. Nests are easily made of boxes or barrels placed inside\r\nthe shelter or outside in the yards. Some turkey growers prefer to build\r\nnesting batteries with nests about 12 by 24 inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--Turkey trap nests. The dimensions of\r\nthis nest are as follows: Width, 14 inches; depth, 24 inches; height in\r\nfront, 19 inches; and height in hack, 45 Inches. The trap-nest fronts may\r\nbe home-made, or commercial fronts may be used.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF HATCHING EGGS\r\n\r\nHatchability can be seriously damaged by holding eggs at temperatures\r\nabove 65° or below 35° F. It is most important to hold eggs in a room\r\nthat can be kept below 65°, preferably between 50° and 60°. Eggs should\r\nbe collected several times daily and held on their sides or on the small\r\nend. It is best to turn eggs gently once daily while they are being held\r\nfor hatching, but this is probably not necessary unless they are to be\r\nkept longer than a week. For best results they should not be held longer\r\nthan 10 days but if they are held at a suitable temperature and are\r\nturned once a day, fair hatchability will be retained for as long as 3\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING\r\n\r\nFeeding young breeding turkeys is a matter of supplying a growing ration\r\nin the fall and early in the winter, a laying ration late in the winter\r\nand in the spring, and a maintenance ration during the summer. Unless\r\nbreeders are to be kept over for another year, they should be marketed,\r\nif possible, about June 1 in order to reduce feed costs and to aid in\r\npreventing the spread of blackhead and other diseases that may affect\r\nadult turkeys during the summer. If breeders are to be held over for\r\nthe next season or until fall and if a good summer and fall range is\r\navailable well away from the growing stock, the breeders are best carried\r\nthrough the summer on a daily feeding of whole grain such as a mixture of\r\nequal parts of corn, oats, and wheat. This mixture should be fed at the\r\nrate of one-fifth pound per hen daily as a supplement to feed obtained\r\nfrom the range. The toms, if ranged with the hens, should have access to\r\ngrain in a feeder too high for the hens to reach. A better method is to\r\npen the toms in a separate range lot and give them each one-half pound of\r\ngrain daily in troughs.\r\n\r\nBreeding stock so managed during the summer respond economically to a\r\nfattening diet offered in the fall. Beginning about 4 weeks before they\r\nare to be marketed, usually early in October, the birds may be offered\r\nall they will eat daily of the grain mixture. Within 4 weeks they will\r\nacquire a fine finish and make a gain in weight of 2-1/2 pounds or more\r\nper hen and 4 pounds or more per tom. About 5-3/4 pounds of grain per\r\npound of gain is required for the 4-week fattening period. A little\r\nbetter finish is acquired in 6 weeks; but the grade is not improved, and\r\nthe gains are more expensive. Breeding stock that are to be kept over\r\nshould be held in the range lots as long as possible and should also be\r\nfed liberally in the fall, in order to put them in good condition for the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nLater in the fall and through the winter the rations for breeders,\r\nespecially young breeders, may be the same as the growing rations\r\nnormally fed to young stock. Scratch grain and a simple mash, such as\r\nthat suggested for growing poults, make a good feed for carrying the\r\nbreeders through the winter, since they meet the demands of the birds for\r\ncontinued growth or for maintenance. If the climate is such that green\r\nfeed and sunshine are not available, as in the Northern States, add 5\r\npercent of alfalfa-leaf meal and 1 percent of cod-liver oil to the mash.\r\nThe birds should have all the mash and scratch they will eat during the\r\nfall and winter. Breeders will not become too fat if fed in accordance\r\nwith this method. They will be fat, but this is desirable if heavy egg\r\nproduction is expected.\r\n\r\nFor the production of large numbers of hatchable eggs turkeys require\r\na ration containing the various nutrients and vitamins. Good results\r\ncan be obtained with a simple laying ration, such as laying mixture No.\r\n1, if the birds get an abundance of fresh green feed and have range.\r\nWhen ground oats or ground barley is included in any mixture it should\r\nbe finely ground. Alfalfa leaf meal should be bright green in color.\r\nThe cod-liver oil should be a standard good-quality product, or the\r\nequivalent in fortified cod-liver oil may be used if thoroughly mixed.\r\n\r\n_Laying Mixture No. 1_\r\n\r\n       MASH                      _Parts by |       SCRATCH\r\n                                   weight_ |\r\n                                           |\r\n  Yellow corn or barley (ground)        20 | Mixture of equal parts of\r\n  Wheat middlings or ground wheat       15 |  yellow corn, wheat, and\r\n  Oats or barley (ground)               20 |  heavy oats.

Just\r\nenough to carry the birds through each day should be given. In this way\r\nits freshness is assured, an important consideration in all-mash feeding.\r\n\r\nIf desired, the oyster shell or limestone may be fed separately in\r\nhoppers, but mixing it in the mash saves labor and prevents excessive\r\nconsumption. Gravel or granite grit should be provided to furnish\r\ngrinding material. Clean water, placed in contamination-proof vessels,\r\nshould be provided at all times. Alfalfa hay probably cannot be depended\r\nupon to supply adequate amounts of green-feed substitute for hatching-egg\r\nproduction. Only by fresh green feed or green-feed substitutes and fish\r\noils can those requirements be met. The oil should be freshly mixed in\r\nthe feed every week or two.\r\n\r\nAll feed should be fed in feeders, never on the ground or in the litter.\r\nFeeders should be constructed so as to prevent waste and contamination\r\nwith droppings. Turkey hens consume a little less than one-half pound\r\nof mash and scratch grain per day when practically all of their feed is\r\nfurnished. Toms consume about 0.7 pound daily; eating mostly scratch\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMBATING DISEASES AND PESTS\r\n\r\nTurkey raisers, to be permanently successful, must follow some system\r\nof sanitation. Many growers have prevented disease and the attacks of\r\nparasites in their flocks by providing range on clean soil; that is,\r\nsoil on which no poultry manure has been spread; feeding their birds\r\nfrom feeders that cannot be contaminated by droppings; and keeping the\r\nquarters sanitary at all times. _Separation of the turkeys from chickens\r\nand other poultry at all times is essential._\r\n\r\nDiseases and parasites of turkeys are discussed in detail in Farmers'\r\nBulletin 1652, Diseases and Parasites of Poultry. Coccidiosis often\r\ncauses heavy losses in young turkeys. It is best combated by carefully\r\ncleaning the brooder house and changing the litter once a week during the\r\nbrooding period, keeping the litter dry, and using wire-covered feeding\r\nplatforms. Turkeys are subject also to the attacks of various species\r\nof worms, but treatment for worms should not be undertaken until the\r\npresence of worms has been determined by examining the droppings or by\r\npost-mortem examination.\r\n\r\nBLACKHEAD\r\n\r\nAlthough other infectious diseases sometimes affect turkeys, blackhead\r\nis by far the most destructive ailment. It is caused by one of the\r\nProtozoa and is primarily a disease of the caeca (the blind pouches\r\nof the intestines) and the liver, but the fact that the head of the\r\naffected bird often becomes discolored has given the disease its common\r\nname, blackhead. It attacks turkeys most frequently, but chicks are\r\noften affected by it without showing symptoms; thus the chickens carry\r\nand spread the infection to turkeys when allowed to range with them. A\r\ncombination of spotted liver and ulcerated caeca indicates that the birds\r\nhave blackhead infection.\r\n\r\nAlthough blackhead affects adult turkeys, it occurs principally among\r\npoults between the ages of 6 weeks and 6 months. It is found to a greater\r\nor lesser extent throughout the United States. The turkeys affected by\r\nblackhead, like all birds having infectious diseases, should be removed\r\nimmediately from the flock to prevent the spread of the disease. The best\r\nprocedure is to kill the sick birds and burn or bury the bodies, as no\r\ntreatment has been found satisfactory. Move the flock to clean ground,\r\nif possible; but if this cannot be done, clean out and disinfect the\r\nroosting place, plow the ground in the yards, and install a system of\r\nyard sanitation. Keep chickens and all other poultry away from turkey\r\nyards at all times in order to prevent infection from this source. The\r\norganisms which cause the disease may be carried by flies, blown with\r\ndust, conveyed in contaminated soil on the feet of the caretaker, or\r\nspread for considerable distances in other ways.\r\n\r\nSeveral measures for preventing blackhead are practiced, the chief of\r\nwhich are: (1) Obtaining eggs or stock from flocks known to be healthy;\r\n(2) quarantining and worming all new stock; (3) cleaning and changing\r\nthe litter at least weekly during the brooding period; (4) keeping both\r\nyoung and mature turkeys on clean ground at a considerable distance from\r\nchickens; (5) excluding, so far as possible, pigeons, sparrows, and\r\npersons from the turkey houses and yards; (6) frequently cleaning and\r\noccasionally disinfecting growing houses, feed troughs, and all other\r\nequipment; (7) feeding only in clean feeders, never on the ground; (8)\r\nimmediately killing and deeply burying or completely burning all diseased\r\nbirds; and (9) eliminating all stagnant water pools where the turkeys\r\nrange. Clean range, clean quarters, clean feed, and clean water are most\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nLICE AND MITES\r\n\r\nLice may cause high mortality among young poults, those badly infested\r\ngradually becoming weaker until they die. Head lice are the most\r\ntroublesome and are found close to the skin near the top of the head,\r\nabove and in front of the eyes, and under the throat. Applying an insect\r\npowder, preferably sodium fluoride, when the hen is set, is an easy\r\nmethod of preventing lice from getting a start among poults. Apply the\r\nsodium fluoride among the leathers, working it well down next to the\r\nskin, 1 pinch on the head, 1 on the neck, 2 on the back, 1 on the breast,\r\n1 below the vent, 1 at the base of the tail, 1 on each thigh, and 1\r\nscattered on the underside of each wing when spread. If this treatment is\r\nnot applied, hen-hatched poults are almost certain to have lice.\r\n\r\nIf the hen has been treated in this manner before being set and the\r\npoults are not exposed to infested stock or premises, they will remain\r\nfree from lice indefinitely. It is well, however, to examine the poults\r\noccasionally and, if lice are found, to apply sodium fluoride sparingly.\r\nIt should not be applied until the poults are at least a week old, and\r\nthen only two very small pinches should be used. Distribute one of these\r\non the neck, the top of the head, and the throat, and the other on the\r\nback and below the vent. After the poults are old enough to roost,\r\ncontrol lice by applying nicotine sulphate solution in a thin line on\r\nthe top surface of the roosts. Repeat as often as necessary to keep down\r\nthe lice and be sure that each bird is exposed to the treatment. Sodium\r\nfluoride applied as directed for delousing setting hens or as a dip will\r\ncompletely eliminate all species of lice from mature stock.\r\n\r\nThe dipping method consists in immersing mature fowls in a large tub\r\nof solution made by mixing 1 ounce or sodium fluoride to each gallon\r\nof tepid water. Immerse the birds for only a few seconds, raising the\r\nfeathers at the same time to allow the dip to penetrate to the skin. Dip\r\nthe birds on a warm day, preferably in the morning, so as to give them\r\ntime to dry before night.\r\n\r\nDestroy red mites in the roosting quarters by painting the under side\r\nof the roosts and the roost supports with anthracene oil, crude oil,\r\ncrank-case oil, or any coal-tar disinfectant. Make the application light\r\nbut thorough, and do it preferably in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe fowl tick or blue bug is one of the worst pests of turkeys in the\r\nSouthwest. It can be controlled by the methods advised for controlling\r\nred mites.\r\n\r\nPROTECTION FROM COLD, DAMPNESS, AND ENEMIES\r\n\r\nProtection from adverse weather conditions and enemies is required\r\nif turkeys are to be raised successfully. An open-front shed with a\r\nreasonably tight roof and dry floor, so arranged that the north, west,\r\nand east sides can be closed against storms, will give ample protection\r\nfor full-grown turkeys. Boosts may be made from good-sized poles or 2\r\nby 4's nailed flat to supports which should be slightly higher at the\r\nrear than at the front, where they should be about 2-1/2 feet above the\r\nfloor. The space between the roosts should be about 2 feet and the space\r\nunderneath enclosed with poultry wire. In the southern part of the United\r\nStates there is little need for well-built turkey houses, but during\r\ndamp, cold, or stormy weather the turkeys should have protection of\r\nsome kind. They should not be exposed to dampness, but they can stand a\r\nconsiderable amount of dry cold.\r\n\r\nIn many localities protection from dogs must be provided in some way.\r\nHigh roosts or well-built shelters provide this at night. Keeping the\r\nbirds confined to high roosts or in dog-proof shelters at night and\r\nduring the early morning hours gives a good protection. An attendant or\r\na good watchdog is needed to protect the turkeys when they are off their\r\nroosts or out of their shelters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCUBATING TURKEY EGGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vigor of the breeding stock, the manner in which it has been fed and\r\nmanaged, and the care given the eggs will determine to a high degree\r\nthe hatchability of the eggs. An important measure of success in turkey\r\nraising is the number of fully matured turkeys raised in proportion to\r\nthe number of hens in the breeding flock. An average of 25 mature birds\r\nraised per hen is considered very good in well-managed turkey flocks,\r\nwhereas in most general-farm flocks 10 to 15 mature birds per hen would\r\nbe a good average.\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation of turkey eggs is 28 days, and the method\r\nis much the same as that used with chicken eggs. Turkey eggs can be\r\nsuccessfully hatched by turkey hens or chicken hens, or in incubators.\r\nHatching in incubators is best and is coming into more general use,\r\nespecially on farms and ranches where turkeys are raised in large\r\nnumbers. Turkeys hatched and reared by hens, especially chicken hens, are\r\nlikely to contract disease and become infested with parasites at an early\r\nage. Sitting turkey hens can cover from 15 to 18 eggs; chicken hens, from\r\n7 to 10 eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL INCUBATION\r\n\r\nHatching the eggs under turkey hens is widely practiced and is often\r\nthe most practical method. When the turkey hen becomes broody and has\r\nremained consistently on the nest for 2 or 3 days, she should be given\r\nher eggs. If several turkey hens are sitting at the same time, care\r\nshould be taken that each gets back into her own nest. Nests are most\r\nconveniently arranged on the ground, in boxes about 2 feet square or in\r\nbarrels. If rats are a menace, the nest should furnish protection against\r\nthem and should always be made proof against larger animals so that the\r\nturkey hens will not be disturbed or the eggs destroyed. The nests should\r\nbe flat and shallow, as deep nests may result in crushed eggs or crushed\r\nbaby poults. Nests with damp sod bottoms and only a little straw to\r\nkeep the eggs from rolling into the corners are generally satisfactory.\r\nNesting batteries in which each hen is provided with a small individual\r\nrun so that she can get off and on the nest at will are very good. With\r\nthis method the only care necessary is to see that feed and water are\r\nalways before the hens and that each one remains broody. If individual\r\nruns are not provided, the hens should be taken off daily, allowed to\r\nexercise and eat, and then returned to their own nests. Plenty of water\r\nto drink and clean, wholesome grain feed, such as a mixture of wheat,\r\noats, and corn, should be provided, and fresh green feed or good alfalfa\r\nhay should be made available.\r\n\r\nTurkey or chicken hens, before being set on turkey eggs, should be\r\ntreated with sodium fluoride, as previously directed.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL INCUBATION\r\n\r\nCorrect incubator temperatures are much the same for turkey eggs as for\r\nchicken eggs, but the greater size of the turkey eggs may necessitate\r\nsome adjustment of the apparatus used in measuring the temperature.\r\nThis is true in nearly all kinds of incubators except those of the\r\nforced-draft type. The relative position of the thermometer in the\r\negg chamber is important in the accuracy with which it records the\r\ntemperature. For hatching turkey eggs the proper position of the\r\nthermometer is usually indicated in the directions that are furnished\r\nby the manufacturer of the incubator. As a general rule, with the\r\nbottom of the bulb 1-7/8 inches above the egg tray, the thermometer\r\nshould read 100.5° F. for the first week, 101.5° the second, 102.5° the\r\nthird, and 103° the last week. Forced-draft incubators are usually run\r\nat about 99.5°. Temperature can best be regulated, however, by using\r\nthe thermometer that goes with the machine, placing it in the position\r\nrecommended by the manufacturer, and then following the manufacturer's\r\ninstructions for hatching turkey eggs, making sure that the egg trays do\r\nnot sag.\r\n\r\nTurkey eggs lose about 3.5 percent less moisture during incubation than\r\ndo chicken eggs, notwithstanding the fact that turkey eggs require about\r\n7 days longer to hatch. Excellent hatches have been obtained when the\r\nloss of moisture based on the weight of the eggs just before they were\r\nset, ranged within the following limits: After 6 days of incubation, 2 to\r\n8 percent; after 12 days of incubation. 4.1 to 6 percent; after 18 days\r\nof incubation, 6.2 to 9 percent; and after 24 days of incubation, 9 to 12\r\npercent.\r\n\r\nOn this basis, a dozen turkey eggs of normal size should lose about 1\r\nounce for every 6 days of incubation. The air cells of turkey eggs are\r\nsmaller in proportion to the size of the eggs than are those of chicken\r\neggs because normal evaporation in turkey eggs during incubation is\r\nconsiderably less than that in chicken eggs. When more moisture is needed\r\nin the incubator it can be provided by putting in water pans, or by\r\nplacing burlap wicks in the pans. When less moisture is needed the water\r\npans may be removed or the ventilation increased.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the eggs should be turned at least 3 and preferably 4 to 6\r\ntimes daily. Four times daily, every 6 hours, day and night, is an\r\nexcellent plan. They should be tested preferably on the eighth or ninth\r\nand again on the twentieth to twenty-second days, and all infertile eggs\r\nand those having dead germs should be removed. Cooling the eggs once or\r\ntwice a day until they feel slightly cool to the face may be of value\r\nin small incubators. Turning and cooling should be discontinued about\r\nthe twenty-third day, and the incubator door should be darkened and kept\r\nclosed until hatching is completed. The poults may then be left in the\r\nincubators for about 24 hours or else put in the brooder and fed as soon\r\nas hatching is completed and the poults thoroughly dried off. Poults\r\nheld in the incubator should be kept at about 95° F. and should have a\r\nrough surface such as 1/4-inch-mesh hardware cloth to stand on. Keeping\r\nthe incubator dark helps to keep the poults quiet and tends to prevent\r\nspraddle legs. There is no good reason for withholding feed longer than\r\n24 hours. If feed is withheld for a much longer period when the poults\r\nare in the brooder, they may eat the litter. Therefore, poults should be\r\nfed when they are put in the brooder house.\r\n\r\nShipping day-old poults in specially built strawboard boxes has been\r\nfound to be satisfactory. The container is larger than that ordinarily\r\nused for baby chicks, 60 poults commonly being placed in each box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING POULTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few turkey-raising problems so important as brooding and\r\nrearing the poults, because the greatest losses in turkey raising usually\r\noccur in the first few weeks of the birds' lives. Heavy mortality among\r\nthe poults may indicate that the breeding stock used was low in vitality\r\nor was poorly managed, but it more often indicates poor feeding or\r\nmanagement of the poults. The importance of keeping both the poults\r\nand the breeding turkeys on ground free from infection and away from\r\nchickens cannot be overemphasized. Improper brooding methods cause great\r\nlosses, because turkey poults are very susceptible to cold, dampness,\r\novercrowding, overheating, unsuitable feeds, and unsuitable litter, and\r\nthey succumb readily to attacks of diseases and parasites.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROODING\r\n\r\nThe poults may be brooded naturally by turkey hens or artificially by\r\nbrooders. Brooding by turkey hens provides a never-failing source of\r\nheat, allows the poults to be raised in small flocks, and permits taking\r\nadvantage of free-range conditions. Its disadvantages are that the\r\nyoung turkeys may contract disease or become infected with parasites\r\nfrom the hens and they may wander too far and be killed by storms or\r\npredatory animals. Artificial brooding makes it easier to maintain proper\r\nsanitation, keeps down costs, puts the poults more directly under the\r\ncontrol of the operator, and is more adaptable to large-scale production.\r\n\r\nNATURAL BROODING\r\n\r\nBrooding poults by turkey hens is not difficult, although several details\r\nshould receive careful attention. As soon as the hatch is completed and\r\nthe poults begin to run out from under the sitting hen, transfer the hen\r\nand her brood to a coop. A coop of simple design, such as the =A=-shaped\r\ntype (fig. 10), large enough to accommodate a turkey hen comfortably,\r\nand well built to protect the brood from rains and natural enemies, is\r\nall that is required. It should be about 5 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 3\r\nfeet high, with a raised, rat-proof floor. Provide good-sized screened\r\nopenings for ventilation in hot weather. These openings should be so\r\nfixed that rain will not beat into the coop. Have a separate coop for\r\neach hen, and if there are several broods, place the coops some distance\r\napart on well-drained soil where the grass is fairly short.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--A well-built brood coop which can be\r\nused either for setting a turkey hen or for raising a brood of poults.]\r\n\r\nFor the first day or so it is well to confine the poults in the coop\r\nwith the mother hen. Then make a small yard, using boards or wire around\r\nthe front of the coop, and allow the poults to run in and out at will.\r\nHowever, they should not be allowed to run in long, wet grass, and during\r\nheavy rains they should be confined to the coop. Move the coop and yard\r\nto fresh ground every few days, clean it once a week or more frequently,\r\nand disinfect it occasionally. When the poults are about a week old\r\nthe mother hen may be allowed to roam with her brood, but care should\r\nbe taken to see that the entire brood returns in the evening and is\r\nprotected at night from predatory animals. Good results may be obtained\r\nby keeping the mother hens confined and allowing the poults to range, but\r\nthe brood should be properly sheltered during rainstorms or damp weather,\r\nwhich are likely to cause high mortality. The poults may be kept with the\r\nmother hen for 3 months or more, but better results are usually obtained\r\nby moving them to a separate rearing field on clean ground when they are\r\nfrom 8 to 10 weeks old. If they have shelter and will roost, they are\r\nbetter off without the hens after that age. A turkey hen will raise up to\r\n20 poults successfully, but more than 20 can sometimes be placed with a\r\nhen in warm weather.\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL BROODING\r\n\r\nThe practice of brooding poults artificially is becoming more popular and\r\nis usually more successful than brooding with turkey hens. The methods\r\nused in artificial brooding are very similar to those used in raising\r\nchicks, which are discussed in Farmers' Bulletin 1538, Incubation and\r\nBrooding of Chickens. However, one point of great importance in brooding\r\npoults artificially is to make sure that they do not crowd together\r\nwhile in the brooder house. This can be avoided by frequent attention,\r\nby providing an even temperature, and by having good ventilation in the\r\nbrooder house. A colony house or permanent brooder house that is suitable\r\nfor brooding chicks is equally suitable for turkeys, but fewer birds\r\nshould be put in the house, as turkey poults are larger than chicks.\r\nBetween 75 and 125 poults should be placed under one 52-inch hover in the\r\naverage colony brooder House. Larger hovers and larger brooding rooms\r\nwill accommodate 225 poults or more, but only an experienced operator\r\nshould attempt; to raise groups larger than 150. The prevailing custom\r\nis to use brooder stoves in portable colony houses or permanent brooding\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nThe colony houses may be moved several times each season, thereby giving\r\nthe poults plenty of free range on clean soil. Since blackhead is closely\r\nassociated with insanitary conditions, special effort must be made to\r\nkeep the houses, runs, and yards clean. If permanent brooder houses are\r\nused, a floor of concrete from 12 to 14 feet wide or a small gravel or\r\ncinder-floored yard is often used in front of the house. A skeleton\r\nframework covered with to 1-inch-mesh wire may also be used to floor the\r\noutside run either with the permanent brooder houses or with the colony\r\nhouses (fig. 11). Poults are regularly confined to this small yard for\r\nthe first 8 weeks and in some cases have been successfully reared to\r\nmarket age in it. However, a clean yard containing growing green feed is\r\nan advantage in brooding. If it is used only for about 8 weeks each year,\r\nthere seems little danger of contamination.\r\n\r\nThe brooder and brooder house should be operated to keep the young\r\nturkeys comfortable. A dim light under or above the hover at night has\r\na quieting effect on the poults. The temperature should be high enough\r\nto keep the poults comfortable but not high enough to be detrimental to\r\ntheir health. When the poults are first put into the colony house with\r\nthe brooder stove, the temperature 3 inches above the floor under the\r\nhover should be from, 95° to 110° F. This temperature should be lowered\r\ngradually as the poults get larger until they are 6 or 8 weeks old, when\r\nthey require little or no heat, especially in the daytime. It is a common\r\npractice in cold weather to keep the general room temperature at the\r\nfloor rather high, about 75°, to prevent crowding. The exact temperature,\r\nhowever, is of minor importance provided the poults are kept comfortable\r\nand good ventilation is maintained. The poults, if comfortable, will\r\nbe active and contented. This is the real test of temperature. All\r\nwarm points and surfaces except those at the brooder itself should be\r\neliminated. Free access from all parts of the brooder room to the hover\r\nmust be provided. All corners in the brooding room, especially back of\r\nthe hover, should be rounded, preferably by using 1/2-inch-mesh poultry\r\nwire. A fence of the same material should be set up around the hover\r\nfor the first 2 or 3 days until the poults become accustomed to their\r\nsurroundings and learn to return to the source of heat. Flat roosts 2\r\nto 2-1/2 inches wide and slightly tilted up at the rear may be placed\r\nat graduated levels in the brooder house when the poults are from 2 to\r\n3 weeks old, to encourage them to begin roosting at an early age. This\r\nprovision lessens the danger of night crowding. The front roost should be\r\n6 inches above the floor and each of the others a few inches higher than\r\nthe one in front of it and about 8-1/2 inches apart, center to center.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--Young turkeys in a colony house\r\nequipped with wire-floored sun porch.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSANITATION\r\n\r\nThe brooder house should be thoroughly cleaned and the litter changed\r\nonce every 7 days, or oftener if disease occurs, regardless of the type\r\nof litter used. This cleaning schedule must be adhered to rigidly if\r\nblackhead, coccidiosis, and other diseases are to be prevented.\r\n\r\nThoroughly clean and disinfect brooder houses and equipment used for\r\nturkeys at the end of each brooding season or oftener if disease occurs.\r\nFirst clean the house thoroughly and burn all litter and droppings or\r\nhaul them to land that is not to be used for poultry and from which\r\nthere will be no drainage into the turkey range. Then scrub the floor\r\nand sides of the house, if it is of board construction, with boiling hot\r\nlye solution (one-third of a can to a pail of water) and allow them to\r\ndry out. Next, thoroughly spray the entire inside of the building with\r\na 3- or 4-percent solution of cresol compound or any other approved\r\ndisinfectant. Give the same treatment once a year to the quarters\r\noccupied by the breeding stock. The \"fire gun\", a large kerosene torch\r\nwhich involves the blow-torch principle, has proved to be valuable in\r\ndisinfecting, if it is properly used and the house has been thoroughly\r\ncleaned.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTER\r\n\r\nSand or gravel is recommended for litter for the first 2 or 3 weeks;\r\nafter that, clean wheat straw is advised as a means of saving labor.\r\nGravel or sand makes the best litter; but with large flocks, using it\r\nfor more than 2 or 3 weeks may require too much labor. Straw or hay, if\r\nused during the first 2 weeks, may cause a stunting of growth and a high\r\nmortality. Many growers have been successful in using, as a substitute\r\nfor litter, 1/2-inch wire mesh stretched tightly a few inches above the\r\nfloor of the house, but it requires much labor to clean this, and it\r\nseems to have no advantage over clean litter. A wire-floored sun porch\r\nmakes a good substitute, for an outside yard during the brooding period\r\nalthough, as previously stated, a clean yard in grass is preferable.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nThe poults, when first hatched, are covered with soft down. When they\r\nare about 10 days old, feathers begin to appear where the wings join the\r\nbody, and in about 3 weeks the tail feathers begin to appear. From then\r\non feather growth is rapid, and when the poults are 2 months old they\r\nare well feathered. About the fifth week fleshy protuberances called\r\ncaruncles begin to appear, and by the seventh week they begin to extend\r\ndown the neck. The appearance of caruncles in the poults is termed\r\n\"shooting the red.\" On the top of the head of both males and females\r\na fleshy protuberance develops into what is called the \"dew bill\" or\r\n\"snood\"; on males it is larger and more elastic than on females.\r\n\r\nThe sex of young turkeys can be distinguished by the appearance of a\r\ntuft of hairs on the breast of males between 3 and 4 months old. The\r\ntuft usually does not appear on the breasts of the females until they\r\nare much older, and the hairs of the tuft are shorter and finer than\r\nthose on males. The hock joints on the males are much broader and heavier\r\nthan on the females. The sex of well-grown Bronze turkey poults can be\r\ndistinguished by examining the mature breast feathers which appear at 12\r\nto 14 weeks. Those of the males are bronze black with no white, whereas\r\nthe tip of those of the females have a narrow white edge. Day-old poults\r\nmay be sexed as is done with baby chicks by examining that part of the\r\nsex organs that can be seen at the vent.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKING\r\n\r\nWhen large numbers of turkeys are raised it is advisable to adopt some\r\nsystem of marking the poults that enables the grower to keep a record of\r\nthe age and breeding of the different broods, as this is of assistance in\r\nselecting early hatched birds for breeding and slaughter purposes. Such\r\na system also makes it possible to separate the poults out of special\r\nmatings from the rest of the flock or from neighboring flocks. The poults\r\nmay be marked by punching holes in the webs between the toes or slitting\r\nthese webs. Different webs may be punched or slit for different broods,\r\nand thus provide a record of all turkeys raised.\r\n\r\nHeavy, aluminum, clinch pigeon-wing bands are well adapted for marking\r\nyoung turkeys. The bands can be applied in two ways:\r\n\r\n  According to the first, the band is first made round and clinched,\r\n  then slipped over the baby poult's toes and flattened so that it will\r\n  not come off but at the same time will allow for some growth of the\r\n  leg. When the poult is about 4 weeks old the band is transferred to\r\n  the wing by unclinching and inserting it in a hole made in the middle\r\n  of the web between the first and second joints of the wing and about\r\n  one-fourth inch from the edge. The band is again clinched and made\r\n  round so that it is not easily flattened and its lettering can be read\r\n  easily. According to the second method of application the band is put\r\n  directly into the wing at hatching time, a thin knife blade being used\r\n  to make the hole for the band, near the edge of the web and midway\r\n  between the joints of the wing. Turkey poults, when good sized, may\r\n  be tattooed on the wing for identification. When the breeding turkeys\r\n  are selected as they approach maturity, heavy wing bands or heavy\r\n  permanent leg bands may be used if the birds were not marked at an\r\n  earlier age.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING GROWING TURKEYS\r\n\r\nSuccess in turkey raising depends mainly upon the combination of feeds\r\ngiven the young poults. Poor-quality feeds, lack of vitamins, and\r\nshortage of proteins, especially if the poults are closely confined, are\r\nthe more common causes or failures. Some difficulty may be experienced\r\nin getting artificially brooded poults to eat, as a young poult is much\r\nless active than a chick; but if several small troughs are provided\r\nthere should be no serious trouble from this cause. Dipping the beaks of\r\nbackward poults in milk or water, or feeding oatmeal flakes may induce\r\nthem to eat. Poults brooded with hens, of course, do not need this\r\nspecial attention.\r\n\r\nAfter the poults are from 6 to 8 weeks old they may get some of their\r\nliving from a good range, but the use of additional feed, preferably a\r\nbalanced ration of mash and scratch grain, will give better growth and\r\nresult in early maturity and greater returns above feed cost.\r\n\r\nIn natural brooding the turkey hen, while confined to the coop, should\r\nbe fed mash and given some tender green feed. Water and gravel or grit\r\nshould, of course, be kept before her all the time. In feeding the hen\r\nand her brood it is advisable to feed the poults outside the coop and the\r\nhen inside in order to prevent the hen from wasting the feed intended for\r\nthe poults.\r\n\r\nFor the first 24 to 72 hours after hatching, poults can live without\r\nfeed, the yolk of the egg which they absorb before hatching being\r\nsufficient to maintain them for that length of time. As soon as they are\r\nput into the brooder house or with the hen they should be fed. If they\r\nare not fed for the first day or two they should be kept in a darkened\r\ncoop or incubator. However, leaving the poults in a darkened incubator\r\nfor only 12 to 24 hours and feeding them as soon as they are removed to\r\nthe brooder seems to be better and is now becoming a general practice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--Cross section of trough feeders for\r\nturkey poults of various ages; _A_, Lath feeder for first week; _B_,\r\nfeeder for second to fourth weeks; _C_, feeder for fifth to twelfth\r\nweeks. Feeder _C_ will give better results if equipped with a reel, at\r\nthe top, similar to that shown in figure 14.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first feed may be a mixture of finely chopped, tender green feed,\r\nand dry starting mash. Hard-boiled eggs, ground or crumbled, may also be\r\nadded if desired. This feed should be placed on clean boards or in little\r\nfeeders made of laths as illustrated in figure 12. It is a good plan to\r\nkeep the feed before the poults at all times from the very beginning so\r\nthat the backward poults will learn to eat and their growth rate will not\r\nbe retarded. Milk, if not too high priced, may be kept before them in\r\neasily cleaned crockery, tin, wooden, or graniteware receptacles which\r\nthe poults cannot get into or contaminate. After the first few days the\r\ngreen feed, unless it is available in the yards, may be spread on top\r\nof the mash in the feeders. Turkey poults appear to be easily harmed by\r\neating large quantities of tough, fibrous litter or green feed; hence the\r\nselection of a tender green feed is most important.\r\n\r\nFEEDING DURING THE FIRST 6 TO 8 WEEKS\r\n\r\nThe use of a well-balanced, all-mash ration is the simplest and most\r\npractical method of feeding poults during the first few weeks of their\r\nlives. Many commercial starting mashes are available or good home-mixed\r\nmashes may be used with excellent success. The protein, mineral, and\r\nvitamin contents are the main points to be considered. Milk in some form\r\nis very desirable, dried milk being preferable. Liquid milk is a fair\r\nfeed, but the dried form is preferable at least for starting rations.\r\n\r\nThe following starting mashes are recommended for feeding turkey poults\r\nduring the first 6 to 8 weeks. Mash No. 1, fed without liquid milk, is\r\npreferable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  STARTING MASH NO. 1                       _Parts by\r\n                                               weight_\r\n  Yellow corn (ground)                          17\r\n  Whole oats (pulverized)                       15\r\n  Meat scrap (50- to 55-percent protein)        12\r\n  Wheat bran                                    12\r\n  Wheat middlings or shorts                     12\r\n  Dried milk                                    10\r\n  Alfalfa leaf meal                             10\r\n  Fish meal (60-percent protein)                10\r\n  Cod-liver oil                                  1-1/2\r\n  Salt (fine, sifted)                              1/2\r\n                                               -------\r\n      Total (crude protein 25 percent;\r\n        crude fiber 6 percent)                 100\r\n\r\n  STARTING MASH NO. 2                       _Parts by\r\n                                               weight_\r\n  Yellow corn (ground)                          33\r\n  Wheat middlings or shorts                     20\r\n  Wheat bran                                    10\r\n  Whole oats (pulverized)                       10\r\n  Meat scrap (50- to 55-percent protein)        10\r\n  Alfalfa leaf meal                             10\r\n  Fish meal (60-percent protein)                 5\r\n  Cod-liver oil                                  1-1/2\r\n  Salt (fine, sifted)                              1/2\r\n                                               -------\r\n      Total (crude protein 19 percent;\r\n        crude fiber 6 percent)                 100\r\n\r\n\r\nStarting mash No. 2 is advised for feeding when liquid skim milk or\r\nbuttermilk is kept before the poults at all times. Some water is\r\nfurnished, allowing one dish of water to several of milk. These starting\r\nmashes are fed without scratch grain; but water, green feed, and hard\r\ngrit such as fine gravel, coarse sand, or commercial granite grit should\r\nbe supplied. The green feed should be chopped fine and scattered on top\r\nof the mash in the feeders once or twice daily, allowing all the poults\r\nwill consume in about half an hour. Tender alfalfa tops, onion tops,\r\nlettuce, and tender, short lawn clippings, preferably those containing\r\nclover, are all good feeds. Tough green feed should be avoided as it may\r\ncause impaction. Green feed as picked by the birds from the yards is\r\nmost desirable. In that case hand feeding is not necessary. The mash in\r\ndry form should be kept before the poults at all times, but only enough\r\nmash to last for a day or two should be supplied at one time. About 1\r\ninch of feeder space per poult (including both sides of the feeders) is\r\ndesirable. This should be increased to 2 or 3 inches after about 2 or 3\r\nweeks. Plans for feeders are shown in figure 12.\r\n\r\nFEEDING FROM 6 TO 8 WEEKS TO MARKETING TIME\r\n\r\nRations for growing the poults after the age of 6 to 8 weeks may include\r\nmash and whole grain or liquid milk and whole grain. Many turkeys are\r\ngrown and fattened on grain supplemented with whatever insects and\r\ngreen feed can be obtained from the range. A better plan is to provide\r\nsufficient protein and minerals to give normal growth. The minimum\r\nfeeding advised is to allow each day one liberal feeding of a 20-percent\r\nprotein mash, or to furnish all the milk the birds will drink with a\r\nfeeding of whole grain. Either the mash or the liquid milk should be used\r\nwith liberal feedings of whole grain for fattening in the fall.\r\n\r\nGood growing mashes suitable for different conditions may be made as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  GROWING MASH NO. 1                        _Parts by\r\n                                               weight_\r\n  Yellow corn or barley (ground)                25\r\n  Oats or grain sorghum (ground)                25\r\n  Wheat middlings or shorts                     20\r\n  Meat scrap (50- to 55-percent protein)        19\r\n  Wheat bran                                    10\r\n  Salt (fine, sifted)                            1\r\n                                               -------\r\n      Total (crude protein 19 to 21 percent)   100\r\n\r\n  GROWING MASH NO. 2                        _Parts by\r\n                                               weight_\r\n  Yellow corn or barley (ground)                32\r\n  Soybean oil meal                              26\r\n  Wheat middlings or shorts                     15\r\n  Wheat bran                                    10\r\n  Oats or grain sorghum (ground)                10\r\n  Steamed bonemeal                               4\r\n  Ground oystershell or limestone                2\r\n  Salt (fine, sifted)                            1\r\n                                               -------\r\n      Total (crude protein 19-1/2 percent)     100\r\n\r\n  GROWING MASH NO. 3                        _Parts by\r\n                                               weight_\r\n  Yellow corn (ground)                          35\r\n  Meat scrap (50- to 55-percent protein)        15\r\n  Wheat bran                                    10\r\n  Wheat middlings or shorts                     10\r\n  Oats or barley (ground)                       10\r\n  Alfalfa leaf meal                             10\r\n  Dried milk                                     9\r\n  Salt (fine, sifted)                            1\r\n                                               -------\r\n      Total (crude protein 20 to 21 percent)   100\r\n\r\n  GROWING MASH NO. 4                        _Parts by\r\n                                               weight_\r\n  Yellow corn (ground)                          20\r\n  Wheat middlings (standard or brown)           15\r\n  Oats (finely ground)                          15\r\n  Wheat bran                                    10\r\n  Alfalfa leaf meal                             10\r\n  Yellow corn gluten meal                       10\r\n  Dried milk                                    10\r\n  Meat scrap (50- to 55-percent protein)         5\r\n  Steamed bonemeal                               2\r\n  Ground oystershell or limestone                2\r\n  Salt (fine, sifted)                            1\r\n                                               -------\r\n      Total (crude protein 20 percent;\r\n        crude fiber 6 percent)                 100\r\n\r\nThese growing mashes are all fed with scratch grains consisting of such\r\ngrains as corn, wheat, barley, and oats. Corn, wheat, or barley may be\r\nused as the only scratch grain except with growing mash No. 4, which\r\nshould contain from 50 to 75 percent of oats. A good grain mixture may be\r\nmade of 40 parts of corn, 40 parts of wheat, and 20 parts of oats. Mashes\r\n1 and 2 are for flocks having access to a good green range. In mash No. 2\r\nsoybean oil meal, which has proved to be a good source of protein and is\r\nalso good for fattening, is substituted for meat scrap. Mash No. 3 is a\r\nmore complete ration and is advised for all conditions where the turkeys\r\ndo not have an abundance of growing green feed.\r\n\r\nOther combinations of grains and byproducts may be used successfully,\r\nthe exact selection depending largely on availability and cost of feeds.\r\nIt is best to use at least two grains, and preferably three or four, in\r\nthe ration. Corn is the grain most commonly used in feeding turkeys. Not\r\nmore than 60 percent of the entire growing ration should consist of\r\noats or barley or a combination of the two. Yellow corn tends to produce\r\na deep-yellow skin color while white corn, barley, and wheat produce\r\nturkeys with light-colored skins.\r\n\r\nIf the birds have all the milk they will drink along with whole grains,\r\nthey will consume enough milk to make good growth, if no water is fed.\r\nA mixture of 30 percent of corn, 30 percent of oats, 20 percent of\r\nwheat, and 20 percent of barley is satisfactory; so is a free choice of\r\nseveral grains. However, the whole-grain and liquid-milk method works\r\nwell only when the birds are on a good, green range and is practical to\r\nuse only when milk products are cheap. Some loss from pendulous crops is\r\nto be expected when liquid milk is consumed liberally and this is one\r\nof the chief objections to its use. The milk receptacles should be set\r\non a wire screen and covered to protect them from the weather and from\r\ncontamination with droppings. Sanitation is especially important when\r\nmilk is used.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUGGESTIONS FOR FEEDING\r\n\r\nFeed should be kept before the birds constantly from hatching to market\r\nage. During the first 6 weeks feed starting mash. During the seventh\r\nand eighth weeks feed a mixture of equal parts of the starting and\r\ngrowing mashes. From 9 to 12 weeks feed the growing mash. From 13 weeks\r\nto marketing feed growing mash and scratch grain. No scratch grain is\r\nfed during the first 12 weeks. If a change is made from mash to the\r\nwhole-grain and liquid-milk method, cut down the mash gradually until the\r\npoults learn to drink the milk and to eat the whole grain freely.\r\n\r\nCod-liver oil is necessary in starting rations, but as a rule it is not\r\nnecessary in a growing ration unless the birds are confined. In that\r\ncase, about 1 percent should be added to the mash. A good grade of plain\r\ncod-liver oil is advised for use in turkey feeds. Fish meal, though an\r\nexcellent feed, may impart an undesirable flavor to turkey meat. Fish\r\nmeal and cod-liver oil should be omitted from the fattening ration\r\nduring the last 8 weeks before the birds are marketed. Birds should not\r\nbe moved, or feeding arrangements radically changed in the last 6 weeks\r\nbefore marketing.\r\n\r\nFeeding the growing mash wet is a common practice in some localities.\r\nLike the dry-mash and scratch-grain system, it produces fine-quality\r\nturkeys although the labor in feeding may be greater. With this method\r\nthe turkeys are fed all they will eat of a moist, crumbly mash placed\r\nin troughs with sufficient trough space provided to accommodate all\r\nthe flock at one time. Only as much mash as the birds will clean up in\r\n30 to 60 minutes is fed twice daily. Tail picking seldom occurs during\r\nmoist-mash feeding if the ration is complete.\r\n\r\nGrit may be furnished in the form of commercial granite grit or coarse\r\nsand for little poults and fine gravel for the larger birds. Limestone\r\ngrit does not serve well as grinding material and is unnecessary with the\r\nrations as listed.\r\n\r\nThe poults may be put on the rearing ground when they are from 8 to 12\r\nweeks old. An alfalfa field is an ideal rearing ground and may be used\r\nas a permanent, fenced, rearing range divided into 2 or 3 sections.\r\nWhen the rearing range is divided into 2 sections, 1 may be used for 2\r\nseasons in succession while the other is rested for 2 seasons. A better\r\nplan is to divide it into 3 parts, allowing 1 season's use followed by\r\n2 seasons' rest for each of the 3 sections. With portable houses and\r\nfences a method known as the \"Minnesota plan\" (p. 37) permits the turkey\r\npoults to be moved to a new section once a week and to an entirely new\r\nplot each year. Land on which no poultry of any kind have run for 2\r\nyears and on which no poultry manure has been spread, may be considered\r\nclean ground. The feed should not be put on the ground but in hoppers or\r\ntroughs which should be moved frequently or set on wire-covered framework\r\nto prevent contamination with droppings. It is very important that the\r\ndrinking water be fresh and clean and that the growing turkeys should not\r\nhave access to stagnant water pools. Watering dishes should be placed on\r\nwire-covered platforms with a device to prevent contamination from the\r\nbirds' perching on the top or sides.\r\n\r\nThe limited-range method with full feeding, as described, is recommended\r\nin preference to free range with limited feeding. However, conditions\r\nsometimes demand that free range be permitted, and limited feeding\r\npracticed. In such cases, when natural feed is abundant, good results\r\ncan be obtained by feeding the poults, after they are from 8 to 10 weeks\r\nold, only once daily, as previously suggested. Any of the growing mashes\r\npreviously listed should make a good supplement to range feeds. This\r\nextra feed will tend to keep the birds nearer home and keep them growing\r\nat a reasonably good rate. Scratch grains should also be fed and as\r\nmarketing time approaches, will be eaten more liberally by the birds. For\r\nturkeys on free range, plenty of water in convenient locations should be\r\nprovided. Water helps to maintain good health and may help to prevent the\r\ncondition known as \"crop bound.\"\r\n\r\nTurkeys which are well fed should make increases in weight comparable to\r\nthose given in table 2, which gives the average weights, at various ages,\r\nox Bronze turkeys raised in an experiment conducted at the United States\r\nRange Livestock Experiment Station at Miles City, Mont. These birds were\r\nfed starting and growing mashes containing about 22 percent of protein.\r\n\r\nTable 2.--_Average weights of Bronze turkey poults from hatching\r\ntime to market age_\r\n\r\n  ---------------+---------------------\r\n                 | Average live weight\r\n                 +----------+----------\r\n      Age        |  Males   | Females\r\n  ---------------+----------+----------\r\n                 | _Pounds_ | _Pounds_\r\n  Newly hatched  |   0.13   |   0.13\r\n  2 weeks        |   0.33   |   0.30\r\n  4 weeks        |   0.86   |   0.75\r\n  8 weeks        |   3.13   |   2.68\r\n  12 weeks       |   6.64   |   5.28\r\n  16 weeks       |  10.35   |   7.67\r\n  20 weeks       |  14.47   |   9.67\r\n  24 weeks       |  18.23   |  11.15\r\n  26 weeks       |  20.18   |  12.04\r\n  28 weeks       |  21.35   |  12.48\r\n  ---------------+----------+----------\r\n\r\n\r\nFEED CONSUMPTION AND COST OF GROWING\r\n\r\nThe quantity and cost of feed used in raising a flock of 156 Bronze\r\nturkeys in Montana in 1934 are shown in tables 3 and 4. These poults (70\r\nmales and 86 females) had well-balanced dry mashes (containing 22 percent\r\nof protein) before them at all times and scratch grain beginning with the\r\nsecond week. The birds were allowed to range on 2-acre nonirrigated lots\r\nafter they were 8 weeks of age. The costs were based on local feed prices\r\nin Miles City, Mont., in 1934. By using the data in tables 2 and 3, the\r\nfeed consumption and cost for an average turkey can be estimated for any\r\nperiod of growth.\r\n\r\nTable 3.--Average feed consumption and cost per pound of gain in\r\n4-week periods for 70 male and 86 female Bronze turkeys in 1934 at Miles\r\nCity, Mont.\r\n\r\n  ---------------+----------------------------+---------------\r\n                 |                            |  Cost of feed\r\n                 |  Feed consumed per pound   |    for each\r\n                 |   of gain in live weight   |    pound of\r\n        Age      +--------+---------+---------+    gain in\r\n                 |  Mash  | Scratch |  Total  |    live weight\r\n                 |        |  grain  |         |\r\n  ---------------+--------+---------+---------+---------------\r\n                 |_Pounds_|_Pounds_ |_Pounds_ |  _Cents_\r\n  1 to 4 weeks   |   2.44 |   0.21  |  2.65   |     5.9\r\n  5 to 8 weeks   |   2.41 |   0.16  |  2.57   |     5.7\r\n  9 to 12 weeks  |   2.42 |   0.43  |  2.85   |     6.1\r\n  13 to 16 weeks |   3.47 |   0.42  |  3.90   |     8.8\r\n  17 to 20 weeks |   3.05 |   1.52  |  4.57   |     9.8\r\n  21 to 24 weeks |   3.09 |   3.45  |  6.54   |    13.5\r\n  25 to 28 weeks |   2.46 |   5.64  |  8.10   |    16.1\r\n  ---------------+--------+---------+---------+---------------\r\n\r\nTable 4.--Average feed consumption per bird in periods for 70\r\nmale and 86 female Bronze turkeys in 1934 at Miles City, Mont.\r\n\r\n  ---------------+--------+---------+----------\r\n       Age       |  Mash  | Scratch |  Total\r\n                 |        |  grain  |\r\n  ---------------+--------+---------+----------\r\n                 |_Pounds_| _Pounds_| _Pounds_\r\n  1 to 4 weeks   |  1.39  |   0.12  |   1.51\r\n  5 to 8 weeks   |  4.45  |   0.29  |   4.74\r\n  9 to 12 weeks  |  6.67  |   1.19  |   7.86\r\n  13 to 16 weeks |  9.96  |   1.21  |  11.17\r\n  17 to 20 weeks |  9.05  |   4.52  |  13.57\r\n  21 to 24 weeks |  7.64  |   8.53  |  16.17\r\n  25 to 28 weeks |  5.19  |  11.89  |  17.08\r\n  ---------------+--------+---------+----------\r\n\r\nUsing the data contained in tables 2 and 3, it will be found that it took\r\napproximately 96 pounds of mash and scratch feed to raise a 21-pound tom\r\nto 28 weeks of age, and about 57-1/2 pounds of mash and grain to raise a\r\n12-1/2-pound hen to that age, or about 4.6 pounds of feed for each pound\r\nof live weight, when practically all feed was furnished. It took about 4\r\npounds of feed for each pound of live weight up to 24 weeks of age. The\r\nbirds had access to a moderate sized range lot containing native grasses,\r\nbut very little feed was obtained from it during the 1934 season.\r\n\r\nDEFORMED BREASTBONES\r\n\r\nCrooked and dented breastbones in turkeys are common and sometimes cause\r\na considerable loss to growers when the birds are marketed, since a\r\nseverely crooked or very deeply dented breastbone causes the carcass to\r\nbe graded as no. 2.\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that faulty nutrition causes most of the\r\ndeformed breastbones, although level roosts narrower than 2-1/2 inches\r\nhave been known to cause deformities of this kind. If turkeys are\r\nsupplied with green feed, fed liberally on one of the rations suggested,\r\nprovided with tilted 2 by 4 roosts or medium-sized poles (see page 35),\r\nand have plenty of direct sunlight, there will be few crooked breastbones\r\namong them. A small number (from 1 to 2 percent) is to be expected as\r\nit seems to be impossible to eliminate them entirely. The addition to\r\nthe ration of steamed bone meal and limestone grit or oyster shell as\r\na mineral reinforcement is recommended by some poultrymen. However,\r\nthe various rations, as listed, supply adequate quantities of the\r\nbone-building ingredients. Further additions are unnecessary and may even\r\nbe harmful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 13.--Mash hopper for feeding young turkeys\r\n12 weeks old or older. The end plan of the same hopper is shown in figure\r\n14.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT FOR RAISING TURKEYS\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTAINERS FOR FEED AND WATER\r\n\r\nDuring the first 3 or 4 weeks after the poults hatch, two-piece crockery\r\nfountains are excellent milk containers. For water, galvanized metal\r\ncontainers are more convenient. When the poults are from 4 to 10 weeks\r\nold, water pails, metal troughs, or shallow tin or graniteware pans\r\nprovided with wire or wooden guards are more satisfactory than fountains.\r\nA good method is to place the water or milk outside the wall of the\r\nbrooder room so that the poults can drink it through a wire screen.\r\nFrom the age of 9 weeks until market age, a supply of running water is\r\npreferable, although ordinary water pails set inside the range house on\r\nthe wire floor or nails or tubs set outside the fence, with openings in\r\nthe wire for the birds' heads, are satisfactory. Changing the position\r\nof the watering devices every few days or setting them on wire-covered\r\nplatforms will aid in providing sanitary conditions near the watering\r\nplaces where filth is likely to accumulate rapidly. A watertight barrel\r\nprovided with a drip faucet and a trough also makes a good watering\r\ndevice. Shade should be provided to prevent the drinking water from\r\ngetting hot. Suitable equipment for feeding mash and scratch feed is\r\nshown in figure 12.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--Diagram of end of mash hopper for\r\nfeeding young turkeys. Side view of same hopper shown in figure 13.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--A waste-proof, portable, outdoor\r\nshelter for feeder. The wire floor helps to prevent contamination from\r\nthe soil and the roof provides shelter when the birds are eating.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--Large range house for turkeys. This\r\ntype is equipped with a wire-floored alleyway, as shown in figures 17 and\r\n18. The antiflies on the roof prevent turkeys from roosting there.]\r\n\r\nSmall trough feeders made of lath (fig. 12, _A_) may be used from the\r\nfirst day in the brooder and until the poults are a week old. Such\r\nfeeders are made with 1 lath for the bottom, 2 for the sides, small\r\nsections for end pieces, and another lath for a guard to keep poults out\r\nof the trough. For poults from 8 days to 4 weeks old it is better to use\r\nlarge trough feeders made of 1/2- by 2-1/4-inch boards for the sides with\r\na top guard consisting of a free-turning reel. Baling wire stretched\r\ninside the troughs (fig. 12, _C_) aid in preventing waste of feed and\r\nalso serve as beak cleaners for the birds. To prevent waste, it is better\r\nnot to fill most trough feeders more than two-thirds full. In the brooder\r\nhouse it is important to place feeders on a wire platform made of 1-inch\r\nmesh, 16-gage wire, and 1- by 4- or 1- by 6-inch boards. Poults 5 to 12\r\nweeks old should have trough feeders made of 1/2- by 5-inch boards for\r\nthe sides, with a free-turning reel at the top. For poults from 12 weeks\r\nold to market age the feeders should be even larger, as illustrated in\r\nfigures 13 and 14.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 17.--End elevation of turkey range house\r\nwith alleyway.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 18.--Floor plan of turkey range house with\r\nalleyway.]\r\n\r\nAfter the age of about 12 weeks, and when feeding is done under shelter,\r\nuse a flat-bottomed trough from 12 to 18 feet long or several short\r\nfeeders made with a 1- by 10-inch board as a bottom, 1- by 8-inch boards\r\nas sides, and with a guard of 1- by 4-inch center piece topped with a\r\nfree-turning roller or reel (fig. 14). For outside feeding a similar\r\ntrough is advisable. It should be divided into two sections each 6 to 9\r\nfeet long, set on 2- by 8- or 2- by 10-inch skids covered with 1-inch\r\nhexagonal mesh, 16-gage wire or heavy gage 1-inch-mesh hardware cloth,\r\nand provided with a gable roof and side boards to protect the feed and\r\nthe birds from sun, wind, and rain (fig. 15). The troughs can be removed\r\nto be used as inside feeders and for replenishing the feed. Two 9-foot\r\nfeeders are sufficient for 150 to 175 birds. Inside feeding is preferred\r\nwhenever possible to provide it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 19.--Interior of 10- by 25-foot ran so\r\nhouse showing wire floor and wire under roosts. Figure 17 shows the wire\r\nnailed on the underside of the roost supports.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 20.--This shed-roof range house will\r\naccommodate from 130 to 150 growing turkeys to market age. The plan of\r\nthis house is shown in figure 21.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSES AND FENCES\r\n\r\nA verminproof, weatherproof roosting shelter for growing poults is an\r\nimportant piece of equipment. A square or rectangular structure with a\r\nshed or gable roof makes a satisfactory range house. A shed roof is more\r\neasily constructed. The use of wire guards called \"antiflies\" will keep\r\nturkeys off the roof. Allowing for a 5-foot wire-floored alleyway to hold\r\nthe feeders and waterers, a house about 10 feet wide and 25 feet long\r\n(figs. 16, 17, 18, and 19) will accommodate 150 to 175 growing turkeys to\r\nmarket age; a similar house about 16 by 18 feet is large enough for 100\r\nbirds. Feeding and watering can be done inside. For a permanent house, a\r\nheight of 5 or 5-1/2 feet at the caves and about 8 feet at the front (or\r\nthe peak, if gable-roofed) is sufficient. If no alleyway is used, a house\r\n9 by 26 feet containing roosts only should care for 130 to 150 turkeys to\r\nmarket age (figs. 20 and 21).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21.--End elevation of range shelter for\r\nturkeys. This type is built without an alleyway and measures 9 by 20\r\nfeet.]\r\n\r\nWith the latter type of house, feeding and watering must be done outside,\r\npreferably with a covered feeder, as shown in figure 15. A cheaper\r\nportable coop, not so high and with framework of lighter material, is\r\nshown in figure 22. This coop is built on 4- by 10-inch skids and is\r\nequipped with raised wire floor and with roosts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 22.--Portable turkey range houses equipped\r\nwith wire floors and antiflies. The house on the left is 16 by 20 feet\r\nand has a feed storage room at one end.]\r\n\r\nA permanent house should face south or in a southerly direction so that\r\nthe front is not exposed to storms. Board sides on the north and west\r\nare desirable. Practically open-air conditions, combined with good\r\nprotection, may be obtained by leaving wire-covered openings about 2 or\r\n2-1/2 feet wide across the north, west, and east sides at about the level\r\nof the roosts. These Openings should be made closable by shiplap doors\r\nthat may be partly opened in warm weather and closed during cold weather\r\nand storms. The south side may be left entirely open except for 1-inch\r\nhexagonal mesh of 16- or 18-gage wire and enough boards to give strength\r\nto the building and protect the birds from rainstorms.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned on page 29, desirable roosts may be made of 2 by 4's with\r\nedges beveled and laid flatwise but slightly titled up at about the angle\r\nof a quarter-pitch roof in the direction toward which the birds are\r\nlikely to face. Roosts made of 2 by 4's or other sawed lumber may cause\r\ndents in the breastbones if they are laid perfectly flat. Smooth poles\r\n2-1/2 to 5 inches in diameter also make good roosts. Material less than\r\n2-1/2 inches wide is not recommended for turkeys half grown or older.\r\nRoosts should be placed preferably 20 to 24 inches apart (center to\r\ncenter), about 14 inches from the wall and lengthwise or the building.\r\nThose nearest the back wall of the shelter should be the highest, and\r\neach of the others should be about 6 inches lower than the one back of\r\nit. This arrangement insures an even distribution of the birds on the\r\nroosts without crowding. Allow about 1 foot of roost space per bird as\r\nthey require as much space as this when approaching market age.\r\n\r\nThe space beneath the roosts should be fenced off and covered with\r\n1-1/2-inch, 18-gage wire mesh to prevent the birds from getting at the\r\ndroppings. This wire should be placed either on the under side of the\r\nroost supports (fig. 17) or on special wire supports (fig. 21), and it\r\nshould be 6 to 12 inches below the top of the roosts. When a wire-floored\r\nalleyway is used, removable vertical panels made of 1- by 4-inch boards\r\ncovered with the 1-1/2-inch hexagonal, 18-gage wire mesh should be placed\r\ndirectly under the roosts which border the alleyways in such a way as to\r\nclose the opening underneath the roosts (fig. 19).\r\n\r\nIn very dry regions, it the space underneath the roosts and wire floors\r\nis entirely enclosed, the droppings may be allowed to accumulate\r\nthroughout the entire growing season to save labor. In damp climates,\r\nhowever, the droppings should be removed frequently.\r\n\r\nWire floors may be used, as described, in the alleyways of roosting\r\nshelters to provide a place for inside feeding and watering and may also\r\nbe used in the outside yards when close-confinement rearing is practiced.\r\nA practical method of construction is to make the floor in removable\r\nsections, each about 5 feet square. The framework should be made of\r\n2 by 4's placed on edge, with the top edge beveled to present about\r\nthree-fourths inch of surface; the center supports may be of 1 by 4's,\r\nalso placed on edge, spaced 12 to 16 inches apart, and laid lengthwise\r\nof the alleyway (fig. 19). This frame should be covered with 1-inch\r\nhexagonal, 16-gage wire mesh or chain-link fabric wire. Hardware cloth\r\nin a 1-inch mesh made of 14-gage wire is perhaps more satisfactory and\r\nwill last longer, but the first cost would be greater. The wire may be\r\nfastened with eight-penny nails and 1-inch staples alternated, one for\r\neach strand of wire, but fastened only to the top or sides of the 2- by\r\n4-inch framework, not to the center supports. The sections should be set\r\nloosely in the alleyway and held 1 inch apart by nails driven into the\r\nsides of the framework. Supports made of either 2 by 4 or 2 by 6 inch\r\nmaterial should be placed on both sides of the alleyway, directly under\r\nthe outer framework of the floor panels, and blocked up so as to hold the\r\nfloor frames 1 foot above the ground.\r\n\r\nSince hen turkeys fly well, it is sometimes difficult to keep them in\r\ntheir runways. Clipping the large outer feathers (called primaries) of\r\none wing will do much to prevent the turkeys from flying, but it is\r\nusually necessary to put a 3- or 4-foot guard made of 1 by 4 or 2 by 2\r\ninch material and lightweight poultry wire around the edge of the roof of\r\nthe roosting shelters, on gates, and on the fences themselves for 2 or\r\n3 rods out from the buildings. Whenever practicable, these \"antiflies\"\r\nshould be slanted in toward the yard (figs. 16 and 20). Clipping the\r\nwings of the toms is undesirable and is usually unnecessary when\r\nantiflies are properly constructed.\r\n\r\nA 5-foot fence is usually high enough to confine turkeys, except near\r\nbuildings and over gates, where the fence should be 8 or 9 feet high.\r\nEven a 4-foot fence has been reported as satisfactory by some growers.\r\nSteel posts and square-mesh poultry fencing of full standard weight make\r\ngood turkey fences.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION AGAINST DOGS\r\n\r\nDogs cause heavy losses among turkeys in many localities. Turkey houses\r\nmust be well constructed to exclude dogs. Wire of 16-gage to 18-gage\r\nweight is necessary, and it must be very tightly nailed. The 16-gage\r\nweight should be used for the outside of buildings where it comes close\r\nto the ground. Confining the turkeys to their shelters all night and\r\nthrough the early morning hours is frequently a necessary precaution\r\nunless an attendant is present or protection is afforded by a good\r\nwatchdog. Fences for confining poultry are not always entirely dog-proof.\r\nHigh roosts, provided by some growers, give protection at night, but in\r\nthe early morning hours when the turkeys are off the roosts, an attendant\r\nshould be in the vicinity. Feeding the flock inside the shelter is\r\nadvantageous when turkeys must be confined during the early morning hours\r\nas this greatly increases the feeding period.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVICES THAT PREVENT TAIL-FEATHER PICKING\r\n\r\nTail-feather picking seems to begin by the birds' using each others' tail\r\nfeathers to clean their beaks of mash. Although it does not ordinarily\r\ndamage the birds for market, the habit ruins their appearance and\r\ndecreases their salability as breeding stock. It is not always possible\r\nto prevent tail-feather picking entirely, especially in flocks raised in\r\nconfinement or in small range lots, but it may be prevented partially by\r\nproviding tightly stretched wire in or over the mash feeders. Baling wire\r\nstretched tightly or strips of ordinary light-weight poultry wire may be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nFeeding the mash moist will also aid in preventing tail-feather picking.\r\nThe kind of mash may also be a factor. A rather coarse mash containing\r\nconsiderable ground corn, some bran, and some coarsely ground oats or\r\nbarley, including the hulls, seems to be more palatable than a fine mash\r\nand is not so likely to clog the beaks of the birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRANGE MANAGEMENT OF GROWING TURKEYS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Minnesota a successful system of moving poults around the colony\r\nbrooder house has been devised and is giving excellent results. The house\r\nis built with a small opening in each side, and a portable frame is so\r\nplaced that the ground on each side of the house can be used as a small\r\noutside run. The birds are allowed to range to the south for from 5 to 10\r\ndays; then the house is thoroughly cleaned and the range changed to the\r\nwest; and so on until the land on all four sides of the house has been\r\nutilized. The house is then moved to a clean spot, and the rotation is\r\nrepeated. After the birds are from 8 to 12 weeks old the house is again\r\nmoved to a clean place. Turkeys may be raised successfully on a small\r\nacreage if they are moved to a clean area each week or two and to an\r\nentirely different, clean area each year.\r\n\r\nOther systems of yarding have been devised, but the value of most of them\r\nhas not been proved experimentally. Some system of rotation is necessary\r\non a farm where turkeys are raised regularly. For fenced ranges where\r\nthe semiconfinement method is to be used, the Minnesota plan is entirely\r\nsatisfactory for small flocks. For large flocks the use of large yards\r\nin the double or triple yarding system has given good results. Under\r\nthis system, after 8 or 10 weeks of brooding, the poults are put on\r\nrange, which may be divided into 2 or 3 equal parts. The range used is\r\nchanged yearly or biennially either by moving the equipment or by having\r\npermanent equipment for each range. In the absence of fences, turkeys\r\nmay be herded so that they are protected from enemies and kept within\r\nthe clean area allotted to them each season. The use of portable fences\r\nand portable roosting shelters enables the grower to move the entire\r\nflock to clean range each season or several times each season. This\r\nmethod is practical where large areas of suitable range are available,\r\nso that the birds can be reared each season on land that has not been\r\nused, or on which no droppings have been spread, for the preceding 2\r\nyears. In wet climates it is probably safer to allow a rest of 3 or 4\r\nyears. Enough range should be provided so that plenty of growing green\r\nfeed is available in each yard at all times during the season. When\r\nthe same ground is used for a whole season, and rainfall or irrigation\r\nis adequate, an acre of grass pasture should provide range and green\r\nfeed for about 100 growing turkeys. An acre of alfalfa or clover would\r\nprobably provide feed for 150 birds, under favorable conditions.\r\n\r\nIn arid or semiarid sections, during very dry seasons, it may be\r\nadvisable to provide fresh, green feed, or legume hay in abundance to\r\ndiscourage the turkeys from eating undesirable green feed on the range. A\r\ncomplete ration must be provided for such conditions.\r\n\r\nWhere the range is limited to small areas of fenced land, the use of a\r\nnumber of permanent range houses set in a row, preferably 200 feet or\r\nmore apart, in the middle of the range and along the dividing fence is\r\na practical method of range utilization. The dividing fence should be\r\ndouble so as to provide a neutral area between the two ranges. Under this\r\nplan the birds can use one-half of the range for 2 years in succession\r\nand the other half for 2 years without the buildings being moved. If\r\nindividual range lots are desired for each flock of birds, permanent\r\nrange shelters arranged on either side of a service lane, each with\r\ndouble or triple yards, are a solution to the clean-range problem.\r\nIf double yards are used for each house or if the range as a whole is\r\ndivided into 2 sections, a rotation of 2 seasons of use, followed by 2\r\nseasons of rest may be the best plan. Where 3 yards for each house can\r\nbe arranged or where the whole range is divided into 3 large yards, each\r\nyard can be used for 1 season and allowed 2 seasons of rest.\r\n\r\nUnder any system of permanent yards, certain sanitary precautions are\r\nessential. Among these are the following: (1) Select such a location or\r\nmodify the one available in such a way that there is as little drainage\r\nas possible from the yards that are being used to those that are being\r\nrested; (2) each season, or several times each season, remove the\r\naccumulations of droppings from the ground around the houses, feeders,\r\nand water vessels; (3) grade up around each house with fresh earth each\r\nseason or whenever it is necessary, to prevent water from standing near\r\nthe buildings; (4) fill in or drain all depressions so that water does\r\nnot stand for any length of time anywhere on the range; (5) use antiflies\r\nand, if necessary, clip one wing of each bird to keep it from flying\r\ninto and contaminating the yards that are being rested; (6) prevent\r\nbirds or persons from going in and out of yards that are being rested;\r\n(7) move feeders and water vessels frequently, feed and water the birds\r\ninside the range shelters on the wire floors, or place the feeders and\r\nwater vessels outside on roofed wire platforms so that the droppings\r\nthat accumulate near them will not become sources of infection; (8) use\r\ncontamination-proof feeders and water vessels; (9) see that flies do not\r\nbreed extensively in or near the houses and feeders; (10) place wide\r\nboards set into the ground, an inch or two at the bottom of the fences\r\nand extending for about 10 yards out from the buildings to prevent refuse\r\nspreading to the adjoining yards.\r\n\r\nWhen birds are herded on free range some growers move the roosts,\r\nfeeders, and water vessels to clean ground several times each season,\r\nwhereas others use permanent roosting and feeding quarters and bring the\r\nbirds back each night. In either case excessive contamination at any one\r\npoint should be prevented so far as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFATTENING TURKEYS FOR MARKET\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general, the best method of raising turkeys is to keep them growing\r\nat a normal rate so that at the age of about 6 months they are in prime\r\nmarket condition, no special fattening period being necessary. Such a\r\nmethod calls for liberal feeding of balanced rations throughout the\r\ngrowing period. A good range will supply a large quantity of feed at a\r\nvery reasonable cost, but not even the best range will furnish enough of\r\nthe right kinds of feed to produce large numbers of prime turkeys without\r\nsupplementary feeding.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, however, turkey growers believe that it is more\r\nprofitable to force the birds to forage for most of their livelihood\r\nuntil a few weeks before marketing time. A good plan for fattening these\r\nrange-grown birds is to begin early in the fall to feed the birds mash\r\nand scratch, allowing them all they will eat of both. As they approach\r\nmaturity they will eat mostly scratch grain. The mash may be fed moist or\r\ndry. Milk is an excellent fattening feed, and if plenty of liquid milk is\r\navailable it may be fed with scratch grain only and no mash. Some turkey\r\nraisers feed equal parts of corn, wheat, and oats during the first part\r\nof the fattening season and gradually change to all corn as the weather\r\nbecomes cooler. This system is satisfactory if plenty of milk can be fed\r\nin addition. Without milk or some other high-protein feed, the results\r\nare likely to be unsatisfactory. If too heavy feeding of corn alone is\r\nbegun before the range turkeys become accustomed to it, the disease known\r\nas scours often results, especially if new corn is used. Old corn is a\r\nmuch better feed than new corn, but the new crop is safe after it is well\r\nmatured and dry.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, turkeys that have been raised on free range cannot\r\nbe successfully fattened in close confinement. They may be successfully\r\nfattened, however, if they are confined to moderate-sized yards\r\ncontaining growing alfalfa or other green crops or stacks of alfalfa or\r\nclover hay. There is no advantage in confining turkeys which have been\r\nraised in semiconfinement to smaller quarters for fattening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKETING TURKEYS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe marketing season for the bulk of the turkey crop is usually\r\ncomparatively short, extending from the middle of November to the latter\r\npart of December. There is an increasing demand in the fall and winter\r\nand even in late summer for young turkeys. Many turkey raisers sell their\r\nbirds alive to poultry dealers, who either dress them or ship them alive\r\nto city dealers. In sections where turkeys are grown in large numbers, as\r\nin Texas, dressing plants have been built by cooperative associations and\r\npoultry dealers who collect the live birds and dress them for the various\r\ncity markets. As soon as possible after reaching the dressing plant, the\r\nturkeys are killed, dry-picked, cooled, and packed in barrels or boxes\r\nfor shipment.\r\n\r\nFarmers near the city markets often dress their turkeys and sell them\r\ndirect either to the consumer or to the city dealer. In territory\r\nadjacent to large cities marketing both live and dressed birds at\r\nroadside stands has become common.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN TO MARKET\r\n\r\nExperiments with Bronze turkeys have indicated that well-fed, young\r\nbirds of this popular variety are marketed to best advantage at from 24\r\nto 28 weeks of age, if they are in good flesh and reasonably free from\r\nshort pinfeathers. If they are kept longer than 28 weeks, the cost of\r\nmaintenance and gains and the extra labor of their care cause the costs\r\nof production to rise rapidly. Under ordinary conditions 26 to 28 weeks\r\nis the best age for marketing full-fed Bronze turkey toms. For turkeys\r\nfed for rapid growth 24 weeks is a more profitable age if the birds are\r\nready for market then, as is often the case with young hens which mature\r\nmore quickly than the toms. Data obtained on more than 600 birds at the\r\nUnited States Range Livestock Experiment Station at Miles City, Mont.,\r\nshow that at 24 weeks of age the feed cost of producing live turkeys was\r\n1 cent per pound lower than at 26 weeks of age, and 2.5 cents per pound\r\nlower than at 28 weeks. These figures, of course, will vary in different\r\nyears, depending on the price of feeds. Besides this cost for feed the\r\nextra labor in caring for the birds, often during unfavorable weather,\r\nmust be considered.\r\n\r\nWith the expansion of the turkey industry, the chain stores have become\r\none of the large wholesale buyers of turkeys. They desire various sizes,\r\naccording to the nature of the patronage in different localities, and as\r\na result create a considerable market demand for hens and small toms.\r\nThis is particularly true of their Thanksgiving and Christmas trade.\r\nOther channels of trade, such as restaurants, hotels, steamships, and\r\nrailroad lines, prefer large toms. As turkeys become more generally used\r\nthroughout the year an increase in the trade for small birds may be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTING BIRDS FOR MARKET\r\n\r\nPractically all turkeys that are full fed are ready for market at from\r\n26 to 28 weeks of age, and in many cases at 24 weeks, depending on sex,\r\nbreeding, feeding, and weather. However, with range birds on limited\r\nfeed, the grower can probably afford to hold his turkeys longer than 26\r\nor 28 weeks, if necessary, because the feed costs were low during the\r\ngrowing period. It is, of course, very important to market only turkeys\r\nthat are fat and free from small pinfeathers. Sufficient protein and\r\nminerals in the feed during the fall months are essential to proper\r\ngrowth and economical gains as well as to proper feather development. A\r\nprime turkey, especially a young one, is not expected to be excessively\r\nfat, but it must have an even covering of fat so that the skin appears\r\nwhite or yellowish white rather than dark or bluish. The breast must\r\nbe meaty and the whole body free from small pinfeathers, bruises, and\r\nabrasions. Great care should be taken, therefore, not to allow the birds\r\nto bruise themselves by flying or running against obstructions; they\r\nshould be handled gently and not frightened.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITHHOLDING FEED BEFORE SLAUGHTER\r\n\r\nBirds with feed in their crops are usually graded as no. 2 and sold at a\r\nlower price because feed in the crop spoils readily, and also detracts\r\nfrom the appearance of the carcass. Mash feed passes out of the crop\r\nquickly so that crops will be empty if the mash is removed at dusk on\r\nthe day before slaughter and no scratch grain fed on that day. If the\r\nbirds are kept without feed for more than 18 or 24 hours they may eat\r\nsoil, litter, droppings, or feathers, and thus defeat the main purpose\r\nof withholding feed. This applies especially to old hens. If the birds\r\nare not to be killed until late afternoon or evening, give them a light\r\nfeed of mash early in the morning. Scratch grain should be fed only until\r\nabout 18 hours before slaughter. Feeding should always be planned so\r\nthat feed is not withheld more than 24 hours. All birds being held for\r\nslaughter should have free access to water up to killing time.\r\n\r\n\r\nKILLING AND PICKING\r\n\r\nWhen the bird is to be killed, hang it up by the feet, holding its head\r\nin one hand and taking care not to compress the veins in the neck.\r\nOpen the mouth and cut the jugular vein far back in the throat, just\r\nbelow the base of the skull. For this purpose use the point of a sharp,\r\nnarrow-bladed knife. As soon as profuse bleeding begins, thrust the knife\r\nup through the groove in the roof of the mouth and into the rear lobe of\r\nthe brain at the back of the skull so as to render the bird unconscious.\r\nWhen the correct \"stick\" is obtained, the bird usually gives a peculiar\r\nsquawk, the tail feathers spread, and all the feathers are loosened by\r\na quivering of the muscles. After sticking, continue to hold the bird's\r\nhead and attach a blood cup to the lower jaw. The bird's wings should\r\nnever be locked, as this often results in their being broken, which\r\nusually reduces the bird to a low grade. Likewise, no attempt should be\r\nmade to hold the bird's wings tightly. Blood cups weighing 5 pounds are\r\nneeded for large birds, whereas cups weighing 3 to 4 pounds are best for\r\nsmall and medium-sized birds.\r\n\r\nIn dry picking it is essential that the feathers be plucked immediately\r\nafter the bird is killed. If the bird has been properly stuck, they come\r\nout very easily. First remove the tail and large wing feathers and then\r\nthe body feathers, leaving the small wing feathers and neck and upper\r\nbreast feathers until last. Pull out all feathers a few at a time, but\r\ndo not rub them off as this injures the skin and often lowers the grade.\r\nDry picking can be learned best by personal instructions. The semiscald\r\nmethod of picking turkeys is used in some sections at commercial dressing\r\nplants, but nearly all home-dressed turkeys are dry-picked.[2]\r\n\r\n[2] Detailed information on killing, grading, and marketing turkeys is\r\ngiven in Farmers' Bulletins 1694. Dressing and Packing Turkeys, and\r\n1815, Grading Dressed Turkeys.\r\n\r\nClean-picked turkeys are now preferred, but a single row of short fan\r\nfeathers on the last joint of each wing may be left. Leave no feathers\r\non any other part of the body. Remove all pinfeathers, especially from\r\nthe breast, but do not attempt to dig out pinfeathers too short to be\r\npulled. After picking, snap the blood from the bird's mouth with a quick\r\nmotion and squeeze the vent to remove any droppings that may be there.\r\nThe feet, if dirty, should be washed and dried. These methods make for\r\nclean carcasses, good grades, and good keeping quality. After picking\r\nand chilling the birds, cover the heads with head wraps made of heavy\r\nwaxed paper, to prevent blood soaking through and smearing the carcasses.\r\nWhenever the skin is torn, sew it neatly with white thread.\r\n\r\nWhen birds have been killed with feed in their crops, remove the entire\r\ncrop. Through a 2- or 3-inch slit in the neck, beginning where the neck\r\njoins the body, the crop can be completely loosened and withdrawn, the\r\ngullet being cut well below the crop. Then sew the opening with No. 36\r\nwhite thread. Turn in the edges of the skin so as to make a neat job that\r\nwill not be noticeable when the bird is put on the market.\r\n\r\nAccording to data on Bronze turkeys, killing and picking after the birds\r\nhad been starved overnight resulted in a loss of about 9 percent of\r\nweight for large birds and 10 percent for small birds. The turkeys were\r\nweighed both before and after they were killed and picked and again after\r\nthey had cooled overnight. The larger birds had the lower percentages\r\nof loss in weight and therefore the higher dressing percentages. The\r\nweight loss of dressed turkeys while chilling overnight is very small,\r\nonly about one-sixth of 1 percent. Therefore, practically all the loss\r\nin weight that occurs during picking and chilling results from the loss\r\nof blood and feathers. The weight loss of turkeys overnight just before\r\nslaughter when they received no feed was about 3 percent, on an average,\r\nmaking the total loss from their normal weight, due to withholding feed,\r\npicking, and chilling, about 13 percent. When dressed turkeys are drawn,\r\nwith head and feet removed and giblets replaced, there is a further loss\r\nof about 15 percent of the dressed weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 23.--Single-layer box of 10 turkey hens.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOLING\r\n\r\nHanging the birds indoors by the legs for 24 hours or more, or laying\r\nthem on their backs on a clean surface where the temperature of the air\r\nranges from 30° to 36° F. will properly chill the carcasses. They should\r\nbe thoroughly chilled but not frozen, since frozen birds sweat and,\r\nbecause of their rigid condition, cannot be packed without great waste\r\nof space. In mild weather it is often impossible to cool the carcasses\r\nproperly without the use of refrigeration or ice water. Cooling in water\r\nspoils the appearance of dry-picked carcasses and should be done only as\r\na last resort. A suitable thermometer is an indispensable part of the\r\nchilling equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\nPACKING\r\n\r\nBoxes and barrels are generally used for packing dressed turkeys.\r\nPacking in clean barrels, while easier and slightly cheaper, is not so\r\nsatisfactory as box packing, although barrels are often more readily\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nBoxes are greatly preferred by the trade and by organized pools. In box\r\npacking, the single-layer pack of 6 to 14 birds, depending on their size,\r\nis preferred. The boxes are usually large enough to hold from 10 to 12\r\nmedium-sized birds (fig. 23).\r\n\r\nWhen barrels are used, a large size is necessary for large toms. Smaller\r\nbarrels are suitable for hens and small toms. Line the barrel with white\r\nwrapping paper or common white parchment paper. Lay the birds with their\r\nbacks against the sides of the barrel, and if it is necessary to pack\r\nlarger birds in the same barrel, place them in the center. When the\r\nbarrel is full, turn down the paper, take off the top hoop, place a piece\r\nof clean burlap over the top, and replace and renail the hoop over the\r\nburlap.\r\n\r\nBoxes, barrels, or any other containers used should be free from\r\nobjectionable odor, as the turkey meat may absorb it.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable risk for the producer who does not have access\r\nto proper refrigerating facilities in shipping dressed turkeys during\r\nmild weather. If the birds are to be sold in mild weather, it is safest\r\nto market them alive or else sell them dressed to local purchasers as\r\nlosses from improper cooling of dressed turkeys and from exposure to\r\nwarm weather during transit are likely to occur. When turkeys are to be\r\nshipped only a short distance it may be feasible to chill the dressed\r\nbirds in ice water and then to pack them in barrels with cracked ice\r\nbetween layers and at each end of the barrel. A top layer of ice placed\r\nbetween two layers of burlap tacked securely over the top of the barrel\r\nis desirable. The internal temperature of the turkeys should be reduced\r\nto 34° F. before they are shipped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRESSED-TURKEY GRADES\r\n\r\n\r\nGrading systems for dressed turkeys differ somewhat in different markets\r\nbut, in general, are similar. Greatest uniformity is provided where the\r\nUnited States grades are used. The United States grading system is more\r\ncomprehensive than other systems and is intended to satisfy the demands\r\nof the consumers more fully and to promote more uniform grading.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government grading system was developed and is\r\nsponsored by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture. Under this system as now used there are four\r\ngrades: U. S. Special or U. S. grade AA; U. S. Prime or U. S. grade A; U.\r\nS. Choice or U. S. grade B; and U. S. Commercial or U. S. grade C. Each\r\ngrade is subdivided into four classes according to the age and sex of the\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nThese classes are: Young hen, young tom, old hen, and old tom. The\r\nquality specifications for individual birds apply to each class with\r\ndue allowance for fleshing condition characteristic of its sex and\r\nage. Detailed descriptions are provided for each grade. For the U. S.\r\nSpecial grade it is required that turkeys have broad, full-fleshed\r\nbreasts and that the carcasses be fully covered with fat. The birds\r\nmust also have been well bled, carefully dry-picked or semiscalded,\r\nand must be free from bruises, skin tears, and broken joints. The\r\nbreastbone must be straight or only slightly dented (not more than\r\none-fourth inch in depth). For the U. 3. Prime grade it is required that\r\nbirds be well fleshed, well fattened, and well bled, but they may have\r\nslight imperfections such as scattered pinfeathers, slight flesh or\r\nskin abrasions, and one disjointed but not broken wing or leg. Slightly\r\ncurved and slightly dented breastbones, not to exceed one-half inch in\r\ndepth, are permitted. To grade U. S. Choice, turkeys must have fairly\r\nwell-fleshed breasts and carcasses fairly well covered with fat. These\r\nbirds need be only fairly well bled and dressed and may have slight\r\nflesh or skin bruises, small skin tears, or larger sewn-up tears, and\r\none broken leg or wing. Turkeys not meeting these grade requirements,\r\nincluding birds poorly fleshed, poorly bled, or slightly deformed, but\r\nsuitable for food, make up the lowest or U. S. Commercial grade.\r\n\r\nAnother system of grading in common use in buying dressed turkeys is to\r\nmake only 2 or 3 grades, except that sometimes the birds within the top\r\ngrades are divided into classes based on weight and sex. The no. 1 grade\r\nusually consists of young toms weighing 12 pounds or more and young and\r\nold hens weighing 8 pounds or more, dressed. For this grade the birds\r\nmust be well finished and free from serious tears, bruises, and severely\r\ncrooked breastbones. The crops must be empty and the carcasses reasonably\r\nfree from pinfeathers and reasonably well bled. The no. 2 grade includes\r\nall old toms and such young toms, young hens, and old hens as are too\r\nlight for the no. 1 grade. The no. 2 grade also includes turkeys with\r\nseverely crooked breastbones, broken wings, bad blemishes, bad tears,\r\nbad abrasions, feed in crops, numerous pinfeathers, and birds that have\r\nbeen poorly bled or poorly fleshed. The no. 3 grade includes birds not\r\ngood enough for the no. 2 grade but still fit for food. These are culls\r\nthat never should have been marketed. The no. 3 grade is not always\r\nused, since turkeys of this kind are often rejected by the buyers. On\r\nsome markets a medium grade of birds--between the no. 1 and the no. 2\r\ngrades--is used.\r\n\r\nWhen graded and packed for market turkeys are further graded as to size,\r\nbirds of similar weight being placed in the same container, which is\r\nlabeled according to the grade.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE WHEN THIS\r\nPUBLICATION WAS LAST PRINTED\r\n\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_             Henry A.
