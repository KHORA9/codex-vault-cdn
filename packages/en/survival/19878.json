Hollister and Mr. Leighton, and describes the flood of\r\nOctober, 1903, which was higher and far more disastrous than the flood\r\nof 1902. The occurrence of two great floods in the same basin during so\r\nshort a period makes the subject worthy of attention, especially as the\r\ndistrict is, from a manufacturing and commercial standpoint, one of the\r\nmost important along the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\n\r\nF.

LEIGHTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages is given a brief history of the disastrous flood\r\nwhich occurred in the Passaic River Basin in October, 1903. In the\r\nreport by George Buell Hollister and the writer, entitled \"The Passaic\r\nFlood of 1902,\" and published by the United States Geological Survey as\r\nWater-Supply and Irrigation Paper No. 88, are discussed the principal\r\nphysiographic features of the drainage basin and their general relations\r\nto the stream flow. This report will not repeat this information, and\r\nthe discussion will be confined to the flood itself. References to local\r\nfeatures will be made without explanation, the presumption being that\r\nthis publication shall accompany the earlier one and be, as it is, a\r\ncontinuation of it. In the present report more attention is given to an\r\nestimate of damages than in the earlier work, and remedies by which\r\ndevastation may be avoided are briefly considered.\r\n\r\nPassaic River overflowed its banks on October 8, 1903, and remained in\r\nflood until October 19. Between these dates there occurred the greatest\r\nand most destructive flood ever known along this stream. Ordinarily the\r\nchannel of the lower Passaic at full bank carries about 12,000 cubic\r\nfeet of water per second, but at the height of this flood it carried\r\nabout 35,700 cubic feet per second.\r\n\r\nThe flood period for the entire stream can not be exactly stated, as the\r\noverflow did not occur at the same time in different parts of the basin.\r\nFor example, the gage-height records at Dundee dam show that the flood\r\nbegan to rise on October 8 at 6.30 a. m., and reached a maximum of 9-1/2\r\ninches over the dam crest at 9 p. m. on October 10. Similarly, on\r\nBeattie's dam at Little Falls the flood began to rise at midnight on\r\nOctober 7, and reached its maximum at 2 p. m. on October 10, or about\r\nthirty-eight hours after the initial rise, the height of the water being\r\n1.29 inches over the crest of the dam.\r\n\r\nThe flood rose on the highland tributaries as follows: On Ramapo River\r\nthe flood crest passed Hillborn at about 10 a. m. on October 9 and\r\nreached Pompton, at the mouth of the river, shortly after noon of the\r\nsame day.\r\n\r\nThe highest reading recorded on the Geological Survey gage at the feeder\r\nof Morris Canal, in Pompton Plains, was 14.3 feet, at about 6 o'clock on\r\nthe morning of October 10. As this gage is read only once daily it is\r\nprobable that this reading does not represent the height of the flood\r\ncrest. Evidence shows that it passed this point on the previous day.\r\nRecords of the Newark water department show that the flood on Pequanac\r\nRiver began to rise at Macopin dam on October 8 at noon, and rose\r\nrapidly to the maximum of 6,000 cubic feet per second at 4 p. m. on\r\nOctober 10.\r\n\r\nNo records are available with reference to the rise of flood on Wanaque\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nObservations made on Pompton Plains on the morning of the 11th show that\r\nPompton River was well within its banks at that time; therefore the\r\nRamapo, Wanaque, and Pequanac must have discharged their flood waters\r\nsome time previous to this hour. The fact is important when considered\r\nin connection with the height of water in the main stream at that\r\nperiod. This observation was made only eighteen hours after the maximum\r\nheight over Beattie's dam at Little Falls, and twelve hours after the\r\nflood crest passed Dundee dam. The conditions here outlined illustrate\r\nthe rapidity with which flood waters are discharged from the Pompton\r\ndrainage area, and the deterring effect of Great Piece Meadows upon the\r\nflood.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the flood on Rockaway River at Old Boonton was almost\r\ncoincident with that on Pequanac River at Macopin dam. The maximum flow\r\noccurred fourteen hours later than the maximum on the Ramapo at Pompton.\r\n\r\nThe flood crest did not reach Chatham on upper Passaic River until the\r\nmorning of October 11, or about twenty-four hours later than the flood\r\nheights in Pompton and Rockaway rivers, and about twelve hours later\r\nthan the maximum over Dundee dam.\r\n\r\nAdequate reasons for these differences in flood periods between\r\nneighboring points are abundant. They are apparent after a review of the\r\nphysiographic conditions described in Water-Supply Paper No. 88.\r\n\r\nThe flood of 1903 was the immediate result of an enormous rainfall, and\r\nnot, as is often the case in north temperate latitudes, the combined\r\neffect of rainfall and the rapid melting of accumulated snows. The\r\nrecords of weather-observation stations in northern New Jersey and New\r\nYork fail to show, throughout their entire observation periods, as great\r\nan amount of precipitation in so short a period. The storm which was the\r\nimmediate cause of the flood occurred principally between October 8 and\r\n11. During that interval rain fell to an average depth of 11.74 inches\r\nover the Passaic Basin.\r\n\r\nThe Passaic Basin is fairly well supplied with storage facilities,\r\nwhich, under ordinary circumstances, would temper the severity of floods\r\nby holding back a large amount of water. In this case no such effect was\r\nproduced, as the reservoirs, lakes, and ponds on the drainage area were\r\nfilled, or practically so, at the beginning of the storm, and there was\r\nconsequently no available space in which to hold back even an\r\nappreciable part of the run-off water. Over some of the dams in the\r\nhighland region a comparatively small amount of water was being\r\ndischarged at the beginning of the storm. Therefore, while these storage\r\nbasins may have had a certain deterring effect upon the rate of flood\r\naccumulation, they could not, in the end, assist materially in\r\npreventing damages in the lower part of the drainage area.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRECIPITATION.\r\n\r\nThe precipitation records for June, July, August, and September are\r\ngiven below:\r\n\r\n_Precipitation, in inches, in Passaic Valley and vicinity, June to\r\nSeptember, 1903._\r\n\r\n-----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+------------\r\n                 |    June.     |    July.     |   August.    |  September.\r\n-----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+------------\r\n                 |Normal.       |Normal.       |Normal.       |Normal.\r\n                 |     Observed.|     Observed.|     Observed.|   Observed.\r\n-----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+------------\r\nHighland region: |      |       |      |       |      |       |      |\r\n  Dover          | 3.29 | 15.02 | 5.54 | 5.47  | 5.08 |  9.04 | 4.02 | 3.39\r\n  Chester        | 3.48 | 12.80 | 6.42 | 7.59  | 5.16 |  9.35 | 4.60 |  ...\r\n  Charlotteburg  | 3.52 |  9.45 | 5.54 | 3.97  | 4.98 |  7.78 | 4.80 | 3.29\r\n  Ringwood       |  ... | 10.13 |  ... | 3.08  |  ... |  6.17 |  ... | 3.06\r\nRed Sandstone    |      |       |      |       |      |       |      |\r\nplain:           |      |       |      |       |      |       |      |\r\n  Paterson       | 4.31 | 11.17 | 5.32 | 5.40  | 4.31 | 10.89 | 4.86 | 2.88\r\n  Hanover        | 3.32 |   ... | 5.23 | 5.40  | 5.20 |  9.40 | 4.52 |  ...\r\n  River Vale     | 3.17 | 10.62 | 4.87 | 3.41  | 4.17 |   ... | 3.61 | 2.90\r\n  Essex Fells    | 3.08 |   ... | 7.03 |  ...  | 5.95 |   ... | 3.67 | 1.80\r\n  Newark         | 3.60 | 11.51 | 4.48 | 4.27  | 4.75 | 14.54 | 3.83 | 4.56\r\n  South Orange   | 3.57 |  9.28 | 5.43 | 4.22  | 5.05 | 13.75 | 4.04 | 3.80\r\n  New York City  | 3.13 |  7.42 | 4.26 | 3.23  | 4.70 |  5.96 | 3.72 | 2.60\r\n  Plainfield     | 3.62 | 10.14 | 5.86 | 4.70  | 4.37 |  6.87 | 4.42 | 7.10\r\n  Elizabeth      | 3.68 |  8.76 | 5.74 | 4.31  | 4.26 |  7.15 | 4.14 | 4.38\r\n-----------------+--------------+--------------+------|-------+------+-----\r\n\r\nAn examination of the above table shows that throughout the summer of\r\n1903 the precipitation was considerably above normal. The records for\r\nJune and August indicate extremely wet months, and the July figures are\r\nslightly above while the September figures are somewhat below normal.\r\nThe important fact shown by this table is that disastrous floods may\r\noccur after long periods of abundant rains. It has been observed that\r\nheavy precipitation may be expected after protracted periods of drought.\r\nSuch a belief is not altogether fanciful. In the northeastern part of\r\nthis country the total amount of precipitation is approximately uniform\r\nfrom year to year. The variations, comparatively speaking, are not very\r\nwide, and we are therefore led to expect that there are in operation\r\ninfluences which serve to compensate for excesses or deficiencies in our\r\nannual rainfall. Therefore after the abundant precipitation of the\r\nsummer of 1903, an observer might have had some measure of justification\r\nin predicting a normally or abnormally dry fall. In view of the actual\r\nevents the fact must be emphasized that in adopting measures to prevent\r\nfloods the margin of safety must be extremely wide. The extraordinary\r\nrainfall of those three October days can not with assurance be accepted\r\nas the maximum.\r\n\r\n_Precipitation, in inches, in Passaic Valley and vicinity, October 7 to\r\n11,

11.83\r\n\r\nFrom the above tables it may be seen that the maximum rate of\r\nprecipitation per hour was 1.38 inches at New York and 1.2 inches at\r\nNewark. Comparison of the tables on pages 11 and 12 gives an excellent\r\nidea of the intensity of the storm. The amount of water falling in a\r\nsingle storm is nearly equal to the total for June, a month of unusual\r\nprecipitation.\r\n\r\nThe average of the total amounts of precipitation recorded at the\r\nvarious stations in the Passaic area is 11.74 inches. These totals are\r\nfairly uniform, none of them varying widely from the average. Therefore\r\nthe figure 11.74 represents a conservative mean for a calculation of\r\ntotal amount of water over the drainage area. Assuming this as the\r\ncorrect depth, the amount of water which fell on each square mile of the\r\nPassaic drainage area during the storm was 27,273,000 cubic feet, or for\r\nthe whole Passaic drainage area over 27,000,000,000 cubic feet, weighing\r\nabout 852,000,000 tons. This amount of water would, if properly stored,\r\nfill a lake with twenty times the capacity of Greenwood Lake, would\r\ncover Central Park in New York City, which has an area of about 1.5\r\nsquare miles, to a height of 645 feet, and, at the present rate of water\r\nconsumption in the city of Newark, N. J., would supply the city with\r\nwater for twenty years.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCENT OF FLOOD.\r\n\r\nHIGHLAND TRIBUTARIES AND CENTRAL BASIN.\r\n\r\nA description of the descent of flood waters from the highland\r\ntributaries into the Central Basin has been given in Water-Supply Paper\r\nNo. 88. It has been shown that the lands of the Central Basin are\r\ncovered even in ordinary freshets, and that in the event of a great\r\nflood the waters merely rise higher, being, for the greater extent,\r\nalmost quiescent, and beyond the flooding of houses and barns and the\r\ndestruction of crops, little damage is done. In other words, the flood\r\nalong this portion is not torrential in character.\r\n\r\nDuring the flood of 1903 the water fell so quickly all over this basin,\r\nand was collected so rapidly by the small tributaries, that a lake was\r\nformed at once which served as a cushion against which the raging\r\ntorrent of the highland tributaries spent itself without doing\r\nextraordinary damage in that immediate region. Bridges which might have\r\nbeen lost in a smaller flood like that of 1902 were actually standing in\r\nslack water by the time the mountain torrents appeared in force. These\r\nstreams caused much destruction higher up in the mountains, but in the\r\nCentral Basin their energy became potential--a gathering of forces to be\r\nloosed upon the lower valley. A discussion of the effects of this will\r\nbe taken up under the heading \"Damages.\"\r\n\r\nIn Water-Supply Paper No. 88 is given the proportion of flood waters\r\ncontributed to the Central Basin by each of the tributaries. These\r\nfigures were computed from the results of gagings maintained for a\r\nperiod sufficient to afford this information within a reasonable\r\napproximation. In the case of the storm which resulted in the flood of\r\n1903 it is probable that data referred to can not be safely applied.\r\n\r\nThe flood of 1902 was the result of abundant rains following upon and\r\nmelting a heavy snow. Weather Bureau records show that neither the depth\r\nof the snow nor the amount of subsequent rainfall was uniform, or even\r\napproximately so, over the Passaic drainage area. Indeed, so marked was\r\nthe variation that it was believed that the mean rainfall for all the\r\nobservation stations on the basin did not bear sufficient relation to\r\nobserved run-off to allow of any reliable deductions. In the case of the\r\nOctober storm, however, the distribution of rainfall was more nearly\r\nuniform, and the run-off from the highland tributaries into the Central\r\nBasin must have been proportionately different in amount from that\r\nindicated in the upland tributary tables in the report of the previous\r\nflood. The data given for the 1902 flood can not, therefore, in the case\r\nof the highland tributaries, be applied to the conditions which obtained\r\nin the flood of 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOOD AT MACOPIN DAM.\r\n\r\nMr. Morris R. Sherrerd, engineer of the Newark city water board, has\r\nfurnished flow computations over Macopin intake dam, which is the head\r\nof the Newark pipe line. As about 73 per cent of the Pequanac drainage\r\narea lies above this intake, the table on page 16 shows roughly an\r\nequivalent percentage of the flow contributed by Pequanac River to the\r\nCentral Basin of the Passaic. In consulting this table it should be\r\nborne in mind that the entire run-off of the drainage area above Macopin\r\nis about 25,000,000 gallons per day more than the amounts presented in\r\nthis table. All reservoirs and ponds connected with the conservancy\r\nsystem of the Newark water supply were filled except that at Oakridge,\r\nwhich was about 1.5 feet below the crest of the spillway.\r\n\r\n_Flow of Pequanac River over Macopin dam, October 7-24, 1903._\r\n\r\n[From Newark water department.]\r\n\r\n                                   Cubic feet.\r\nOct. 8, 6 a. m. to 12 m.               240,600\r\n        12m. to 4 p. m.                347,600\r\n         4 to 6 p. m.                  842,200\r\n\r\n    8-9, 6 p. m. to 6 a. m.         40,110,000\r\n\r\n      9, 6 a. m. to 12 m.           51,870,000\r\n        12m. to 1 p. m.             15,100,000\r\n        1 to 5 p. m.                62,430,000\r\n        5 to 10 p. m.               89,040,000\r\n        10 to 11 p. m.              19,520,000\r\n\r\n    9-10, 10 p. m. to 8 a. m.      201,350,000\r\n\r\n    10, 8 a. m. to 12 m.            75,670,000\r\n        12 m. to 6 p. m.           103,650,000\r\n        6 to 12 p. m.               73,530,000\r\n\r\n    11, 12 to 6 a. m.               56,820,000\r\n        6 a. m. to 12m.             41,440,000\r\n        12 m. to 6 p. m.            32,755,000\r\n        6 to 12 p. m.               25,665,000\r\n\r\n    12, 12 to 6 a. m.               23,800,000\r\n        6 a. m. to 12m.             20,725,000\r\n        12 m. to 6 p. m.            18,450,000\r\n        6 to 12 p. m.               15,105,000\r\n    13, 12 to 6 a. m.               13,370,000\r\n        6 a. m. to 12 m.            11,890,000\r\n        12 m. to 6 p. m.            11,230,000\r\n        6 to 12 p. m.               11,230,000\r\n\r\n    14, 12 to 6 a. m.                9,626,000\r\n        6 a. m. to 12 m.             8,690,000\r\n        12 m. to 6 p. m.             8,022,000\r\n        6 to 12 p. m.                7,353,000\r\n\r\n    15, 12 to 6 a. m.                6,952,000\r\n        6 a. m. to 6 p. m.          12,700,000\r\n       15-16, 6 p. m. to 6 a. m.    10,965,000\r\n\r\n    16, 6 a. m. to 6 p. m.          10,025,000\r\n       16-17, 6 p. m. to 6 a. m.     9,091,000\r\n\r\n    17, 6 a. m. to 6 p. m.           8,690,000\r\n       17-18, 6 p. m. to 6 a. m.     9,893,000\r\n\r\n    18, 6 a. m. to 6 p. m.          10,565,000\r\n       18-19, 6 p. m. to 6 a. m.     8,690,000\r\n\r\n    19, 6 a. m. to 6 p. m.           6,952,000\r\n       19-20, 6 p. m. to 6 a. m.     6,150,000\r\n\r\n    20, 6 a. m. to 6 p. m.           5,882,000\r\n       20-21, 6 p. m. to 6 a. m.     5,749,000\r\n\r\n    21, 6 a. m. to 6 p. m.           5,481,000\r\n       21-22, 6 p. m. to 6 a. m.     5,214,000\r\n\r\n    22, 6 a. m. to 6 p. m.           4,144,000\r\n       22-23, 6 p. m. to 6 a. m.     3,677,000\r\n\r\n    23, 6 a. m. to 6 p. m.           3,877,000\r\n       23-24, 6 p. m. to 6 a. m.     5,749,000\r\n\r\n    24, 6 a. m. to 6 p. m.           5,615,000\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOOD AT BEATTIE'S DAM, LITTLE FALLS.\r\n\r\nThe flow over Beattie's dam at Little Falls, has been calculated\r\naccording to coefficients used for the same dam in Water-Supply Paper\r\nNo. 88. Recorded gage heights show that over the main dam there was a\r\nmaximum depth of 11.12 feet, which continued from 2 to 8 p. m., on\r\nOctober 10, representing a maximum flow of 31,675 cubic feet per second.\r\n(See Pl. I, A.) In the following table is set forth the flow of the\r\nriver over Beattie's dam during the flood, and for purposes of\r\ncomparison, the figures for the flood period of March, 1902. It should\r\nbe borne in mind in consulting this table, that in the case of the flood\r\nof 1903 exact dates and hours are given, while the figures for the 1902\r\nflood represent flow determinations at six-hour intervals, beginning\r\nwith the initial rise of that flood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nU.

October 8 to about midnight October 18. Although the maximum\r\nrecorded gage height was 19 inches higher than during the flood of 1902,\r\nthe actual time during which the river was out of its banks was\r\nforty-five hours less than at the earlier flood. Examination of fig. 1\r\nshows that the flood of 1903 was decidedly more intense than that of\r\n1902, the maximum height being reached in 1903 in about sixty hours,\r\nwhile in 1902 the maximum was not reached until the expiration of about\r\none hundred and twenty hours.\r\n\r\nAt Dundee dam the familiar break in the progress of the flood took place\r\nabout thirty-five hours after the initial rise. It occurred before the\r\ntime of the maximum gage height at the mouth of Pompton River, and there\r\nis nothing to indicate that it was caused, as has been claimed, by slack\r\nwater from the Pompton flood being forced back into Great Piece Meadows.\r\nThere is no doubt that a part of the Pompton flood was so diverted, but\r\nthere was maintained throughout at Little Falls a steady pressure, which\r\nconstantly increased to maximum. This flood check, at Dundee dam was\r\nobserved in 1902, but it could not be shown to arise from the frequently\r\nmentioned phenomena at the mouth of Pompton River. It is important to\r\nprove or disprove this hypothesis. If it were found to be true, it\r\ncould be advantageously taken into consideration in connection with\r\nmeasures for the prevention of flood damages. As the Pompton had no such\r\neffect upon the flood flow at Dundee dam in two consecutive historic\r\nfloods, the writer is inclined to believe that the idea is entirely\r\nerroneous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Comparative flood run-off at Dundee dam, March,\r\n1902, and October, 1903.]\r\n\r\nSince the flow curves in fig. 1 were drawn it has been found by careful\r\nobservation that the depressions which occur in the rise of every flood\r\nover Dundee dam are probably due to the carrying away of the flashboards\r\nwhich are placed upon the dam crest in times of low water. A review of\r\nthe gage heights recorded by floods for several years past shows that\r\nthe break occurs when the height of water over the dam crest reaches\r\nfrom 40 to 60 inches. The flashboards used upon this dam are usually 18\r\ninches wide, and as they are supported by iron rods, which are of\r\napproximately the same strength and are placed upon the dam by one crew\r\nof workmen, it may be safely assumed that they are of approximately\r\nequal stability and might be expected to fail almost simultaneously\r\nalong the length of the dam crest. So sudden a decrease in the effectual\r\nheight of the dam must lower the water on the dam crest markedly, and as\r\nevery other probable cause has been eliminated in the case of the recent\r\nflood, the explanation of the check in the progress of floods over this\r\ndam may be safety accepted as due to carrying away of flashboards. This\r\neffect should be apparent in the gage-height records only.\r\n\r\nIn the flow diagrams (figs. 1 and 2) the effect would not be the same,\r\nbut the curve would rise more sharply. Similarly, the measurements at\r\nthe beginning are not correct, as they are calculated according to gage\r\nheights measured from the stone crest of the dam. Therefore, a true\r\nflood curve at this point would be much flatter at the beginning and\r\nrise sharply at a period coincident with the carrying away of the\r\nflashboards.\r\n\r\nAn important difference between the two floods is that the earlier\r\ncontinued longer, but the later one was much higher. The flood of 1902\r\nwas caused by the turning of an equivalent of approximately 6 inches of\r\nprecipitation into the main channel during a period of six days. In the\r\ndeluge of 1903 there fell 11.74 inches of rain, the greater part of\r\nwhich was precipitated in 36 hours. Thus it is seen that there was in\r\nthe flood of 1903 a larger rainfall during a much shorter period than in\r\nthe flood of 1902. Computation shows that the total run-off from the\r\ndrainage area above Dundee dam during the earlier flood was\r\n13,379,000,000 cubic feet, and that on account of the frozen condition\r\nof the ground at that time this amount of water represented practically\r\nall of the precipitation. During the flood of 1903 there was a total\r\nrun-off for the same area of 14,772,000,000 cubic feet, which represents\r\nabout 66 per cent of the observed precipitation. According to these\r\nfigures the total amount of run-off in the 1903 flood was only 10 per\r\ncent greater than that in 1902, while the actual flood height during the\r\n1903 flood was 27 per cent higher than during the flood of 1902. The\r\nabove comparison shows, in a striking manner, the effect of the\r\ncondition of the surface. In the case of the later flood we had, as has\r\nbeen stated in previous pages, an area which had been well watered\r\nduring the previous summer, and the observed ground-water levels were\r\nfairly high. There was, however, sufficient storage capacity in the\r\nbasin to retain about 34 per cent of the precipitation occurring between\r\nOctober 7 and 11. This water must have been largely absorbed by the\r\nearth. The general relations of the floods of 1903 and 1902 can\r\ntherefore be briefly stated as follows:\r\n\r\n_General relations of floods of 1903 and

STATEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimates of flood damages are always approximations only. It is\r\npossible to determine with a fair degree of assurance the cost of\r\nreplacing structures which have been carried away, to estimate the value\r\nof goods destroyed--especially if they be commodities stored in shops or\r\nwarehouses--to calculate the amount of operatives' wages lost, and in\r\nthe case of general mercantile business to estimate the damages incurred\r\nthrough consequent reduction of trade. Destruction by flood, however\r\nvast, is incomplete. It differs materially from destruction by fire, for\r\noften destructible property is of value after floods have passed.\r\nBuildings which are inundated still retain value, and many kinds of\r\nmerchandise are not totally destroyed. Therefore when the amount of\r\ndamages is calculated there is always to be taken into consideration the\r\nfact that a part of the material which has been flooded can be\r\nreclaimed, and retains some proportion, at least, of the value which it\r\nhad previously possessed. Furthermore, damages by flood enter into\r\npractically every detail of social and business affairs. There are\r\nlosses which are severe to one or more persons, and which can not be\r\nappreciated except by those whom the floods have actually overtaken.\r\nTherefore estimations of flood damages can be only approximate, and\r\nwhile a measure of accuracy may be reached with respect to a part of the\r\nlosses, there remains a necessity for approximation which can not be\r\nclassed with carefully computed damages along other lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGHLAND TRIBUTARIES.\r\n\r\nAlong the three northern tributaries, the Ramapo, Wanaque, and Pequanac,\r\nand at their confluence with the Pompton, the destruction by flood\r\nwaters was far greater than along the Rockaway, Whippany, and upper\r\nPassaic, or in that area described as the Central Basin. In the drainage\r\nareas of the three tributaries last mentioned the waters were higher\r\nthan in the flood of 1902, but the general effects were of the same\r\nnature, and consisted principally of flooded lands, houses, and\r\nwashouts. There were few radical cases of complete destruction like\r\nthose which marked the course of the flood in the northern tributaries.\r\nThe principal interest is therefore confined to the Pompton and the\r\nthree highland tributaries which discharge into it.\r\n\r\n_Ramapo River._--The greatest destruction was along the Ramapo. It is\r\nthe largest of the upland branches, and was therefore the heaviest\r\ncontributor to the main stream. Throughout the flood period the stream\r\nwas especially violent, causing great apprehension in the lower valley.\r\n\r\nThe destruction along several stretches of the valley was almost\r\ncomplete. Nearly all the dams failed, and every bridge across the river,\r\nwith one exception, was carried away. Some small villages were swept\r\nbare, and the damages to realty value and personal property were\r\nexcessive.\r\n\r\nIt was only by strenuous measures that the dam impounding the waters of\r\nTuxedo Lake was saved. If this had failed the destruction along the\r\nentire course of the river, even to the cities in the lower valley,\r\nwould have been enormously increased.\r\n\r\nThe dam at Cranberry Pond, in Arden, failed in the early part of the\r\nstorm, the flood waters disabling the Tuxedo electric-light plant and\r\ninundating the Italian settlements along the river below. The failure of\r\nthe dam conserving the waters of Nigger Pond, which lies at the head of\r\na small tributary emptying into the Ramapo below Tuxedo, resulted in the\r\ninundation of Ramapo village. The village of Sloatsburg was practically\r\nobliterated.\r\n\r\nThe damage at Pompton Lakes was especially severe. During the early part\r\nof the flood the timber dam of the Ludlum Steel and Iron Company, which\r\nraised the water to a height of 27 feet, and afforded 7.04 horsepower\r\nper foot fall, was carried away with a part of the headrace. (See Pl.\r\nII, _A._) This sudden emptying of Pompton Lake, an expanse of 196 acres\r\n(see Pl. II, _B_), was extremely destructive to Pompton Plains, and the\r\ndestruction of the dams above on Ramapo River, which followed some time\r\nafter the bursting of the lower dam, refilled Pompton Lake above its\r\nformer level, and caused greater damage than that which resulted from\r\nthe failure of Pompton dam itself. The large iron bridge just below the\r\ndam was carried away, with the stores of the Ludlum Steel and Iron\r\nCompany. The river front along this company's property was destroyed,\r\nalong with coal docks at the head of Morris Canal feeder. The channel of\r\nthe river below the dam is filled with débris, which will raise the\r\nheight of the water in the tailrace, and unless it is cleared will\r\ndiminish the available power at the iron works. It has been\r\nauthoritatively announced, however, that the power facilities will not\r\nbe restored, as the Ludlum Steel and Iron Company is preparing to use\r\nsteam power exclusively.\r\n\r\n_Pequanac and Wanaque rivers._--Along Pequanac River the principal\r\ndamage consisted of washed-out roads and destroyed bridges. The large\r\nponded area in this basin was practically full at the time of the flood,\r\nand, as measurements at Macopin dam show, the run-off per square mile\r\nwas extremely large. In the Wanaque drainage area the storage facilities\r\nafforded at Greenwood Lake were probably useful in holding back a part\r\nof the water for a brief period, but the damages along the stream are\r\ncomparable to those of the Pequanac.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the flow from these two streams, added to that of the\r\nRamapo, was particularly disastrous over the Pompton Plains.

In all about 100 houses were inundated\r\non Pompton Plains, and the damage to roads and culverts was particularly\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\nThe total loss in the drainage area of Pompton River was $350,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL BASIN.\r\n\r\nOver the Central Basin there was the usual impounding of flood waters,\r\nbut the effects were not materially different from those described in\r\nthe report on the flood of 1902. The damage along this basin from floods\r\nof this character is accumulative by reason of the fact that the\r\npresence of water over the land for so long a period kills the desirable\r\nfeed grasses and fosters in their place the coarse meadow grass. This\r\neffect has been observed for some years, particularly since the flood of\r\n1896. It is estimated that over the Central Basin the damage to crops\r\nand arable land alone arising from the floods of 1902 and 1903 amounts\r\nto $300,000. A statement of the damage arising from the later flood can\r\nnot separately be made, as its effect upon the fertility of the meadow\r\nlands can not be determined without the experience of a planting season.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOWER VALLEY.\r\n\r\nThe flow of the stream through the constricted channel at Little Falls\r\nand on to Great Falls at Paterson is given in the weir measurements on\r\npage 17. It was attended by comparatively large damages, the features of\r\nwhich were not materially different from those described in the previous\r\nreport. The pumping station of the East Jersey Water Company, situated\r\njust below Little Falls dam, did not suffer as severely as during the\r\nprevious flood, by reason of the fact that extensive and effective\r\nbarricades were placed so as to keep a large part of the water away from\r\nthe pumps. This was not accomplished in the flood of 1902. The total\r\ndamage in this district amounted to nearly $200,000.\r\n\r\nThe channel contours were changed somewhat in this portion of the\r\nstream. In the river at the pumping station of the East Jersey Water\r\nCompany there was completed a somewhat interesting cycle of changes,\r\ndescribed in the following extract of a letter from Mr. G. Waldo Smith,\r\nchief engineer for the New York aqueduct commissioners, and formerly\r\nengineer and superintendent of the East Jersey Water Company:\r\n\r\n\"No better illustration of the old adage, 'The river claims its own,'\r\ncould be given than that offered by the action of Passaic River at\r\nLittle Falls, New Jersey, at the point where the works of the East\r\nJersey Water Company have been constructed. These works were built\r\nbetween 1897 and 1900. In the course of the work the river channel for a\r\ndistance of several thousand feet down stream from the power house was\r\ndrained and improved, so that the head on the wheels at the ordinary\r\nstage of the river was increased about 6 feet. From the time this\r\nimprovement was completed to March, 1902, through the action of the\r\nordinary flow of water and moderate floods, this head had been reduced\r\nabout one-third. The great freshet of March, 1902, cut off about another\r\nthird, and the recent flood has completed the cycle and entirely wiped\r\nout the benefit due to the river improvement, and the water at the\r\npumping station stands now at almost precisely the same level that it\r\nstood before any improvements were undertaken. New bars were formed in\r\napproximately the same location as they existed before, and, so far as\r\npossible, except for the changed conditions brought about by the\r\nbuilding of the power station, the condition of the river is not\r\ndissimilar to that existing when the work was commenced.\r\n\r\n\"In this connection it might be well to state that a New Jersey drainage\r\ncommission, in blasting out a channel below the Little Falls dam some\r\nyears ago, dumped a considerable portion of the excavation in the deep\r\nwater under the Morris Canal viaduct.\r\n\r\n\"The action of the two great floods, March, 1902, and October, 1903, has\r\nwashed a large part of this material out of this deep hole and piled it\r\nup in the river about 300 feet below where the river widens, and reduces\r\nthe force of the current.\r\n\r\n\"I have made no estimate of the amount of material deposited in the\r\nriver, but offhand should say that it would be at least 100,000 yards.\"\r\n\r\n_Paterson._--The flood district in the city of Paterson (see Pl. III)\r\ncomprised 196 acres and involved the temporary obstruction of 10.3 miles\r\nof streets. Along the streets close to the river banks the height of\r\nwater was 12 feet, sufficient to inundate the first floors of all the\r\nbuildings (see Pl. I, _B_), and in some cases to reach to the second\r\nfloor. During this flood period householders who remained at their homes\r\nwere compelled to use boats, while in the more exposed places the danger\r\nwas too great to admit of remaining, and at one time 1,200 persons were\r\nhoused and fed in the National Guard armory at Paterson.\r\n\r\nThe bridges crossing Passaic River in Passaic, Essex, and Bergen\r\ncounties were almost completely destroyed, and the damage amounted to\r\n$654,811. Within the limits of Paterson, below Great Falls, all of the\r\nhighway bridges except two were either severely damaged or completely\r\ncarried away. West street bridge, the first below the falls, was a Melan\r\nconcrete, steel-arch structure, built in 1897, and costing $65,000. It\r\nwas composed of three spans, each about 90 feet long. The flood\r\npractically split two spans longitudinally, the upstream side of each,\r\nequal to about one-third of the width of the bridge, being carried\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nU.

This structure was built to conform to the established grades of\r\nstreets on both sides of the river and was completely inundated, forming\r\na barrier for floating débris and practically making a dam in the river.\r\nMain street bridge is a 3-span, steel-arch structure, which was\r\ncompletely covered during the flood, but was only slightly injured. Arch\r\nstreet bridge, built in 1902 to take the place of a structure carried\r\naway by the March flood, was a concrete-arch bridge of three spans. It\r\nwas undermined at the north pier and collapsed, being practically\r\ndestroyed. The original cost of this bridge was $34,000. Its piers\r\npresented a serious obstruction to the flow of the stream, especially as\r\nthe channel is very narrow at this point. In addition to this, the\r\nbridge was of low grade and admirably adapted for deterring flood flow.\r\nBelow Arch street bridge all the other structures crossing the Passaic\r\nwere of iron and were carried away, with the exception of Sixth avenue\r\nand Wesel bridges. Those destroyed were designated as follows: Straight\r\nstreet, Hillman street, Moffat, Wagaraw, Fifth avenue, East Thirty-third\r\nstreet, and Broadway bridges. All these structures were built too low,\r\nand were inundated during the early stages of the flood.\r\n\r\nThe damage to real property, stock, and household goods in the city of\r\nPaterson amounted, according to certified returns, to about $2,700,000.\r\nIt is impossible to secure correct figures, because merchants and\r\nmanufacturers refuse to give details of losses, fearing that the\r\npublication thereof would affect their credit. General ideas concerning\r\nthe destruction by the flood can be gathered from Pls. I, _B_, III, IV,\r\nV, and VI.\r\n\r\n_Passaic and vicinity._--Below the city of Paterson destruction was as\r\ncomplete as in Paterson, although the damage was not as great because\r\nthe improvements were not as valuable. Damage to property, exclusive of\r\npublic works, in this region, amounted to about $1,250,000. This\r\nestimate does not take into consideration losses by manufacturers\r\narising from destruction of raw materials or finished products. The\r\nflood was about 4-1/2 feet higher than that of 1902. (See Pl. VII, _A._)\r\n\r\nOn the right bank of Passaic River, in the city of Passaic, the damage\r\nwas severe, especially to manufacturing plants. In addition to the flood\r\nin the Passaic itself, the bursting of Morris Canal, a few miles east of\r\nPassaic, flooded Wesel Brook, which in Passaic is used as the tail-race\r\nof the Dundee Power Company. The capacity of Wesel Brook channel is\r\nlimited, and the extraordinary amount of water which was turned into it\r\ncarried away all culverts and bridges from Richfield to Passaic.\r\n\r\nBelow Passaic, along the river front of Essex County, the damages to\r\nbridges amounted to $50,000. (See Pl. VII, _B._) The loss due to\r\nwashouts in roads throughout the county amounted to $15,000. The\r\neffects of the flood were apparent along the entire length of the river\r\nand into Newark Bay. The damage from inundation in Newark and vicinity\r\namounted to $753,199.\r\n\r\nThe figures above given with reference to damage along Passaic River are\r\nuncommonly accurate, being for the most part the result of a\r\nhouse-to-house canvass by the northern New Jersey flood commission. As\r\nhas been stated above, tradesmen are reluctant to give full details with\r\nreference to their losses through fear of injured credit. Roughly\r\nestimating the damage as a whole, and taking into consideration factors\r\nwhich were given to the writer confidentially, the damage throughout the\r\ndrainage area from this flood will amount to not less than $7,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTIVE MEASURES.\r\n\r\nGENERAL DISCUSSION.\r\n\r\nIn the consideration of means of preventing damages by floods every plan\r\nproposed falls under one of two general heads--the storage of flood\r\nwaters or an increase in the capacity of the streams.\r\n\r\nThe first plan involves the construction at selected localities of\r\nreservoirs of sufficient size to hold all or a greater part of the\r\nwaters which run over the surface during and after storms. This plan is\r\nnot practicable except where valleys or plains are inclosed by high\r\nridges and these ridges approach sufficiently near each other to admit\r\nof the economical construction of a bank or dam across the gorge or bed\r\nof the stream which flows through, so that the inclosure will be\r\ncomplete and form a water-tight basin. Where such a reservoir exists the\r\nwater can be held back and gradually let down through properly provided\r\ngates so that the channel will not be flooded.\r\n\r\nFor flood purposes alone it would be necessary to provide reservoirs of\r\nsufficient capacity to contain the run-off waters resulting from the\r\nlargest storms. With such provisions it would be necessary to entirely\r\nempty the reservoir as soon as possible after a storm had passed and\r\nleave its full capacity available for the next storm. It is therefore\r\nbetter, wherever possible, to provide a reservoir capacity considerably\r\nlarger than that represented by the run-off from the heaviest storms, so\r\nthat water may be stored for use as power or domestic supply. With such\r\nprovision it is necessary merely to draw from the reservoir water to a\r\ndepth equivalent to the stream run-off in the drainage area above.\r\n\r\nThe second plan for prevention of flood damages involves provisions for\r\nletting the flood water out rapidly by removing obstructions to its flow\r\nby straightening and deepening the channels and providing long\r\nembankments, dikes, or levees which rise above the ordinary river level\r\nto a height exceeding that of the stream during its highest floods. This\r\nplan is most generally followed in the case of large rivers like\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nU. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY WATER-SUPPLY PAPER NO. 92 PL.

In\r\nSwitzerland, where the torrents occasioned by the rapidly melting snows\r\nare especially destructive, the flood waters are confined by a series of\r\nparallel dikes on each side of the river, which have the effect of\r\ndividing the flow into several parallel streams. As the main river\r\nchannel fills and overflows the inner dikes, the overflow water collects\r\ninto the first series of parallel channels, and when a height is reached\r\nat which the second dikes are overflowed the water collects into the\r\nthird, and so on. This gives an enormous carrying capacity, the limit of\r\nwhich is approached slowly, and therefore abundant opportunity is\r\nafforded for preparation upon the part of the riparian owner.\r\n\r\nThe drainage basin of Passaic River is admirably adapted to the\r\ndevelopment of the conservation system. At its headwaters in the\r\nmountains of northern New Jersey are numerous sites for reservoirs. The\r\ncomparatively limited area draining into Passaic River makes such a\r\nscheme relatively inexpensive. On the other hand there is abundant\r\nopportunity for effective work in removing obstructions and\r\nstraightening and deepening the channel of the lower river. So that, all\r\nthings considered, the prevention of flood damages in the Passaic Basin\r\ncan be best accomplished by a combination of the two general methods\r\nabove outlined.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOWER VALLEY IMPROVEMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe channel of Passaic River below Great Falls, at Paterson, is of\r\nlimited capacity. To anyone making an inspection, especially within the\r\ncity of Paterson, it is readily apparent that the river bed has for\r\nyears been considered a legitimate field for encroachment. Owners of\r\nlands fronting on the river have increased their holdings by filling in\r\nbeyond the channel line. Buildings have been erected upon these tracts\r\nand the builders have not hesitated to extend retaining walls still\r\nfarther into the river bed. Refuse from the city's streets, light and\r\nunstable in character, has been freely deposited upon the bank to be\r\ncarried out into the river. Thus the channel has been constricted\r\nlaterally, the bottom raised, and there is left for the flood waters no\r\nalternative than that of extending themselves in the upward direction.\r\nIt would seem that this, at least, should have been unobstructed. Such,\r\nhowever, is not the case.\r\n\r\nThe bridges across the Passaic have apparently been erected without\r\nreference to channel capacity. The authorities have evidently considered\r\nit more important to retain established approach levels than to provide\r\nproper capacity for river water. As an example the following instance\r\nmay be cited: During the flood of 1902 a steel truss bridge across the\r\nriver in Paterson was carried away. The point of crossing was one of\r\nthe narrowest places in the stream and it should have been clear to\r\neveryone that the space beneath the bridge was not large enough to carry\r\nflood waters. It should have been apparent that a new bridge, if erected\r\nat that point, must be higher than the old one, to be thoroughly safe.\r\nNotwithstanding, the new bridge was erected at the level of the old one,\r\nand in addition to this, it was a concrete arch structure, and the great\r\npiers and low arch springs reduced the former channel capacity about 15\r\nper cent. This new bridge, as might be expected, collapsed during the\r\nOctober flood.\r\n\r\nAlong the entire course of the stream in the lower valley we find a\r\ncontinuation of instances of unreasonable encroachment and\r\nill-considered bridge engineering, and there is opportunity for\r\nrelieving a large part of the purely local obstructions by straightening\r\nthe channel at chosen points.\r\n\r\nAlthough this matter has not been thoroughly investigated it is readily\r\napparent to one traversing the river bank that considerable relief may\r\nbe secured in this manner. Damage, however, can not be prevented by this\r\nmeans alone. It would, of course, be possible to erect high and\r\nresistant levees along the entire course of the river, but this would be\r\nextremely expensive and would destroy the water front for commercial\r\npurposes. In fact, such a plan is quite visionary. At the present time\r\nthere are no obstructions in lower Passaic River the removal of which\r\nwould give relief in the event of floods like those of 1902 and 1903.\r\nWhen one considers the amount of water which was carried into the lower\r\nvalley, the heights which it reached, and the area which it inundated,\r\nthe futility of any local improvement except levee construction is\r\nemphasized. The present channel of the river will not carry without\r\ndamage the amount of water recently thrown into it, and while it is\r\nimportant to provide regulations which will in the future prevent\r\nencroachment, and which will correct the evils now present along the\r\nchannel, these measures can not, operating of themselves, give relief\r\nfrom flood devastation. Immunity from flood destruction in the Passaic\r\nmust come, if it ever comes, from the construction of flood-catchment\r\nreservoirs in the uplands.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to spend any great amount of time in determining the\r\ncause of floods upon the Passaic. A review of the flood history of this\r\nriver shows that in every case floods arise from extraordinary\r\nprecipitation. High waters occur through the melting of snows and during\r\nperiods of abundant rain. The heavy floods which have been regarded as\r\nextraordinary are clearly the result of unusual conditions of\r\nprecipitation. The river carries the usual flood waters, and no damage\r\nis done until the water poured into it is far beyond its carrying\r\ncapacity. Therefore the provisions which are made for preventing damage\r\nby floods must, if they be effective, be designed to meet extraordinary\r\nconditions, and means which would prove effectual in ordinary cases\r\nwill not stand the test. In order to appreciate the extent of the flood\r\nin the lower valley it is necessary to visit the flooded area and\r\nobserve the points of flood height. Unless one does this he will be very\r\nreadily deceived when he considers means of flood prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOOD CATCHMENT.\r\n\r\nAmong the highland tributaries of Passaic River there are three\r\nprincipal areas where storage reservoirs for flood catchment may be\r\nplaced: (1) The Ramapo, Wanaque, and Pequanac drainage basins, from\r\nwhich the waters are carried into the central basin by Pompton River;\r\n(2) the Rockaway drainage basin, and (3) the upper Passaic drainage\r\nbasin. The remaining principal tributary of Passaic River, the Whippany,\r\nis not well provided with storage reservoir sites. The combined capacity\r\nof catchment reservoirs which could be constructed in these drainage\r\nareas is considerably more than the volume of the heaviest known\r\nrainfall, that of October 8-11, 1903.\r\n\r\nIn the description of reservoir possibilities in the following pages the\r\ndata with reference to many of the basins are computed from planimeter\r\nand other measurements, the United States Geological Survey topographic\r\nmaps being used as a base. The measurements are therefore not of refined\r\naccuracy but suffice for the purpose in view--that of showing flood\r\ncatchment possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOMPTON RESERVOIR.\r\n\r\nThere are in the Pompton system several sites on Ramapo, Wanaque, and\r\nPequanac rivers which, if utilized, would afford sufficient storage for\r\nflood catchment purposes, but the entire flow of the river system may be\r\nconserved in what has been described as the Pompton reservoir. This\r\nproject was first presented by Mr. C. C. Vermeule in the year 1884, the\r\ndetails being described at some length in the Engineering News, of April\r\n12 of that year, pages 169-171. In this article Mr. Vermeule presented\r\nthe possibilities of Pompton reservoir for use as an additional water\r\nsupply for the city of New York, at the time when the Quaker Bridge\r\nreservoir on the Croton watershed was being considered. A few pertinent\r\nquotations from this article may be of interest:\r\n\r\n     This basin, subdivided by minor ridges which cross it, furnishes\r\n     several admirable sites for large storage reservoirs, with\r\n     catchments from 50 to 400 square miles in area, lying above on the\r\n     primitive rock of the Highlands. About 6 miles of the northeastern\r\n     end of the basin is cut off by Hook Mountain, a small ridge of trap\r\n     which crosses it from east to west, inclosing a basin 21 square\r\n     miles in area, known as Pompton Plains, having its outlet at\r\n     Mountain View, 5 miles west of Paterson, at a pass in Hook\r\n     Mountain, through which the Pompton River flows to join the\r\n     Passaic, 2 miles below. This pass is the gateway by which the\r\n     Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, the New York and\r\n     Greenwood Lake Railway, and the Morris Canal enter the plains. The\r\n     basin is also crossed near its head, above Pompton, by the New\r\n     York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad.\r\n\r\n     The Pompton River has a drainage area above Mountain View of 420\r\n     square miles. It is formed near the head of the basin by the\r\n     confluence of the Pequanac from the northwest, the Wanaque from the\r\n     north, and the Ramapo from the northeast. * * *\r\n\r\n     The entire flow from this watershed may be stored by building a dam\r\n     across the gap at Mountain View and converting Pompton Plains into\r\n     a great lake covering an area of 21 square miles. The elevation of\r\n     the river at the gap is 168 feet. The slopes in the basin being\r\n     gentle up to an elevation of 220 feet and abrupt beyond it, it will\r\n     be advisable to take this as the minimum or low-water level of our\r\n     reservoir. It is generally estimated that 25 per cent of the volume\r\n     of the mean annual rain on a given catchment is sufficient\r\n     reservoir capacity to fully utilize the flood flows. We have long\r\n     series of observations of rainfall at three points, which may be\r\n     taken to fairly represent the Passaic catchment. At Newark the mean\r\n     annual rainfall is 46.2 inches, at Paterson, 50 inches, and at Lake\r\n     Hopatcong, 42. The last being on the Highlands, like most of our\r\n     watersheds, is perhaps the safest to use. Now, 25 per cent of 42.5\r\n     inches, 10.62 inches, which, on 420 square miles, give a volume of\r\n     10,362,000,000 cubic feet, the necessary capacity of reservoir.\r\n\r\n     By raising our reservoir to 240 feet when full we secure a capacity\r\n     of 10,493,000,000 cubic feet, or ample to utilize the heaviest\r\n     floods of the watershed. This gives a beautiful sheet of water 21.1\r\n     square miles in area, with bold, rocky shores, and a depth at dam\r\n     of 72 feet. We secure the above capacity by uncovering but 22 per\r\n     cent of the reservoir bottom; and, as we shall presently see, we\r\n     shall rarely need more than half this storage, and probably not\r\n     oftener than once in ten years will we expose over 10 per cent of\r\n     the area. By building side dams to keep certain flats always flowed\r\n     this may be reduced to 5 per cent; and this area will be pretty\r\n     evenly distributed around 36 miles of uninhabited shore line,\r\n     leaving the reservoir open to no valid sanitary objections. On the\r\n     contrary, by relieving the remainder of the Passaic Basin of the\r\n     flood waters of the Pompton, which now flow large areas of flat\r\n     land during wet seasons, the sanitary condition of the valley would\r\n     be much improved.\r\n\r\nIn constructing this reservoir Mr. Vermeule stated that the following\r\nwork would be necessary:\r\n\r\n     The removal of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad from\r\n     the basin by changing the alignment for 6 miles. It may be done\r\n     without increase of length or detriment to the alignment.\r\n\r\n     Three and one-fourth miles of the Morris Canal must be rebuilt. No\r\n     engineering difficulties are involved.\r\n\r\n     Of the New York and Greenwood Lake Railway, 9 miles would have to\r\n     be rebuilt.\r\n\r\n     The New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad would be slightly\r\n     shifted or raised for 3-3/4 miles.\r\n\r\n     A dam 2,400 feet long and 80 feet in height, with tunnels,\r\n     wasteweir, and accessory works would be required at Mountain View.\r\n     The situation is such that an ample wasteweir may be built at a\r\n     low-side dam on the solid rock of Hook Mountain remote from the\r\n     dam, and outlets may be had by tunneling the same ridge. Hence the\r\n     dam may be a plain, heavy earthen embankment; built, of course,\r\n     with every precaution but subject to less than the usual dangers of\r\n     such works. However, a masonry dam might readily be substituted.\r\n\r\n     There would be 14,000 acres of arable land, swamps, and rough\r\n     mountain land flowed.\r\n\r\n     The works are estimated to cost as follows:\r\n\r\n     Railroad and canal diversions                $505,000\r\n     Dam and accessory works                     1,162,000\r\n     Land damages                                1,400,000\r\n                                                 _________\r\n     Total                                       3,067,000\r\n\r\nA recomputation of the drainage area above Mountain View, made by the\r\nnorthern New Jersey flood commission, shows that it is 380 square miles\r\nin extent. It was decided by this commission that the construction of\r\nthis reservoir would be the most approved method of preventing\r\ndisastrous floods in the lower valley of the Passaic. By raising a dam\r\nto a height of 202 feet above tide, 8 inches of water on the drainage\r\narea above might be held back, which, it was believed, would be a\r\nsufficient maximum for flood catchment. With this amount of storage the\r\nestimates of the flood commission showed that the remainder of the\r\ndrainage area would not turn a sufficient amount of water into the lower\r\nvalley channel to cause flood damages.\r\n\r\nIt was also demonstrated by the flood commission that by increasing the\r\nheight of the dam an opportunity would be afforded for conserving water,\r\nand at the maximum height of 220 feet above tide sufficient storage\r\ncapacity would be available to provide 5,000 horsepower at Little Falls,\r\nGreat Falls, and Dundee dam throughout all dry seasons. The value of\r\nsuch a storage reservoir for municipal water-supply purposes is\r\nself-evident.\r\n\r\nThe cost of Mountain View reservoir would be about $3,340,000. Developed\r\nfor flood catchment with the spillway of the dam at 202 feet above sea\r\nlevel the area of the reservoir would be 13.4 square miles, and the\r\nstorage capacity 7,200,000,000 cubic feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAMAPO SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nAlong the Ramapo Valley there are alternative propositions, one of which\r\ninvolves the construction of a dam below Darlington and another across\r\nthe head of Pompton Lake.\r\n\r\nIn either case the water might be raised to the 300-foot contour, and if\r\nthe dam across Pompton Lake were constructed a continuous lake would be\r\nformed extending 10-1/2 miles to Hillburn, N. Y. The improvement in\r\neither case would be positive, for as the country surrounding is hilly\r\nor mountainous it affords excellent opportunity for the location of\r\nsummer homes and parks, the lake being a potent factor in beautifying\r\nthe situation and increasing the value of the surrounding region. There\r\nare, nevertheless, several things to be taken into consideration, the\r\nmost important of which are the improvements which have been made by\r\nwealthy residents along the valley where it has already been developed\r\nas a summer resort.\r\n\r\nBy the construction of a dam at Darlington 1,100 feet long and 70 feet\r\nhigh, the water would be raised to the 300-foot contour. The reservoir\r\nwould have a water area of 2,064 acres, and the approximate storage\r\ncapacity of 2,325,000,000 cubic feet.\r\n\r\nA dam across the head of Pompton Lake 2,850 feet long and 100 feet high\r\nwould raise the surface of the proposed lake to the 300-foot contour.\r\nThis reservoir would have an area of 6.19 square miles and a capacity\r\nof 6,300,000,000 cubic feet, equal to 17.5 inches run-off from the\r\ndrainage area. Here the measure of safety is wide, and if there were\r\ndrawn from the lake an amount of water equal to 12 inches on the\r\ndrainage area there would still be 5.5 inches which could be used for\r\ncompensating purposes.\r\n\r\nThe construction of either one of the above-described reservoirs would\r\ninvolve interstate complications, as the 300-foot contour in Ramapo\r\nValley includes a considerable part of the State of New York. This\r\nobstacle was deemed insurmountable by the northern New Jersey flood\r\ncommission, and that commission directed studies to a reservoir which at\r\nthe time of maximum flood would not back water into New York State to a\r\ngreater height than it already rises during such floods. The following\r\ndescription is taken from the report of the engineering committee of the\r\nflood commission:\r\n\r\n     An admirable dam site is offered on Ramapo River about 2 miles\r\n     above Oakland village. The drainage area tributary to this point is\r\n     about 140 square miles in extent, the country for the most part\r\n     being quick-spilling and upland. By constructing there a dam 700\r\n     feet long and 65 feet high a reservoir with a water surface of 2.8\r\n     square miles would be afforded, the flow-line elevation being 280\r\n     feet above tide. The capacity of such a reservoir would be\r\n     1,768,000,000 cubic feet, equal to about 5.5 inches on the drainage\r\n     area.\r\n\r\n\r\nWANAQUE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nNear the headwaters of Wanaque River is Greenwood Lake, a large body of\r\nwater described in Water-Supply Paper No. 88. Its value as a flood\r\ncatchment basin is somewhat uncertain, as it is used as a storage feeder\r\nfor Morris Canal. The surface level of this lake is controlled by gates,\r\nwhich naturally are operated by the canal authorities for the benefit of\r\nthe canal. Therefore it is the object to store as great a volume of\r\nwater as possible, and the water falls below the dam crest at the outlet\r\nof the lake only when the dam opens in dry seasons and makes it\r\nnecessary. Under such conditions there is no certainty that storage\r\ncapacity will be available during the time of a great storm, and in fact\r\nGreenwood Lake has been overflowing at the commencement of the storms\r\nwhich caused both of the recent floods.\r\n\r\nIn view of the condition expressed above it will be necessary in\r\nproviding for flood catchment in the Wanaque drainage area to omit\r\nentirely from consideration the possibility of assistance from Greenwood\r\nLake. Below this point in the basin are several sites at which could be\r\nraised dams, which would effectually retain a large proportion at least\r\nof storm run-off. They may be described as follows:\r\n\r\n_Midvale reservoir_.--By building a dam 60 feet high and 1,200 feet long\r\nacross Wanaque River near Midvale, a reservoir would be formed which\r\nwould have a water surface of 2.1 square miles and a capacity of\r\n1,491,000,000 cubic feet. The drainage area above this site is 83 square\r\nmiles, and the storage capacity would therefore be equal to about 7.7\r\ninches on the drainage area. The construction of this project would\r\ninvolve the relocation of about 4-1/2 miles of the New York and\r\nGreenwood Lake Railroad; the damages apart from this would be nominal,\r\nthe cost of the entire reservoir construction being about $1,000,000.\r\n\r\n_Ringwood reservoir_.--Ringwood Creek runs through a gorge about 1 mile\r\nabove its confluence with the Wanaque. Above this is a well-defined\r\nbasin. A dam about 70 feet high and 585 feet long would create a lake\r\nhaving an area of 520 acres, the surface of which would be 380 feet\r\nabove sea level. The drainage area tributary to this point has an area\r\nof about 20 square miles, and as the proposed reservoir would have a\r\ncapacity of 915,800,000 cubic feet, there could be conserved a run-off\r\nof 20 inches. Allowing for a flood run-off of 12 inches there would\r\nstill be available for compensating purposes 8 inches on the basin,\r\nequal to 373,550,000 cubic feet. The construction of this reservoir\r\nwould involve the relocation of about 2 miles of the Ringwood branch of\r\nthe New York and Greenwood Lake Railroad, and the condemnation of\r\ncomparatively valuable improvements in the proposed basin.\r\n\r\n_West Brook reservoir_.--The drainage from 5.7 square miles might be\r\nconserved by the erection of a dam on West Brook, a tributary of Wanaque\r\nRiver, which enters it from the west. There is an available site at\r\nwhich a dam 280 feet high might be erected. At this elevation the length\r\nalong the top would be about 1,150 feet and about 2,330,000,000 cubic\r\nfeet of water would be impounded. Little benefit would be derived from\r\nsuch a reservoir, as the limited drainage area affords a comparatively\r\nsmall proportion of flood run-off that might be well cared for at a\r\nlower point. For compensating purposes, however, a reservoir might be\r\nconstructed here, the capacity of which could be adjusted to the actual\r\ndemands. If the dam were raised to a height of about 280 feet from the\r\nbase the storage afforded would be equal to 176 inches on the watershed,\r\nor about four average years of precipitation, which is far beyond all\r\nprobable storage necessities. The maximum available storage capacity is\r\ngiven in this case merely to show possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEQUANAC SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThere are few available reservoir sites of large size along the lower\r\nreaches of Pequanac River. In the upper basin, however, there is a\r\nsufficient available storage capacity to afford almost complete control\r\nof destructive floods from that part of the drainage area. Large tracts\r\nare already reserved by the city of Newark for collection of municipal\r\nsupply, and the storage capacity developed is sufficient to serve the\r\ncity throughout the driest seasons. The total capacity of Clinton,\r\nOakridge, and Canistear reservoirs is about 1,155,000,000 cubic feet.\r\nThese basins are not available for flood catchment, as the water is used\r\nfor city purposes and an endeavor is made to have in storage at all\r\ntimes the largest possible amount. The condition is exactly similar to\r\nthat described in the case of Greenwood Lake. In considering the means\r\nfor the construction of flood-catchment reservoirs in Pequanac Basin\r\nthere must be taken into account the conservation and delivery of the\r\nNewark supply. The adjustments with reference to the amount of water\r\navailable at Macopin intake would have to be met, and if the system were\r\ninterfered with compensation therefore would be taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n_Newfoundland reservoir_.--Pequanac River passes through a deep gorge\r\nbetween Copperas and Kanouse mountains, just below the village of\r\nNewfoundland. This point has been considered an excellent site for the\r\nconstruction of a dam, and in the installation of the present\r\nwater-supply system of Newark it is proposed that the entire valley in\r\nwhich Newfoundland is situated be overflowed. The site is one of the\r\nmost advantageous known for the creation of a flood-catchment basin. If\r\na dam 50 feet high were erected across this gorge, a lake would be\r\nformed which would have a surface area of 3.15 square miles and a\r\ncapacity of 3,267,200,000 cubic feet, equal to a storage of about 30.5\r\ninches on the 46.12 square miles of contributing drainage area. This\r\nwould afford complete protection in case of a sudden run-off of 12\r\ninches, would provide for the supply of the city of Newark without\r\ngreatly disturbing the present storage system of that city, and would\r\nstill yield a large amount of water for compensating purposes in dry\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nThe construction of Newfoundland reservoir would be very expensive, as\r\nit would involve the flooding of Newfoundland Village, in which there is\r\nconsiderable improved property. About 3 miles of the track of the New\r\nYork, Susquehanna and Western Railroad would be submerged, as well as a\r\nconsiderable mileage of macadamized highways. On the whole, however, the\r\nNewfoundland reservoir project is the most favorable which can be found\r\non the Pequanac Basin. There are above this point numerous reservoir\r\nsites, but their combined capacity would not be equal to that of the\r\nproposed Newfoundland reservoir, and the construction would be probably\r\nquite as expensive.\r\n\r\n_Stickle Pond reservoir_.--Below Newfoundland there are few available\r\nplaces at which water could be stored. Stickle Pond is probably the best\r\nadapted of any of those available. If a dam 1,050 feet long and 80 feet\r\nhigh were erected across the river about 1 mile below the present outlet\r\nof Stickle Pond, a lake would be formed having a surface area of 422\r\nacres and a storage capacity of about 800,000,000 cubic feet. The\r\ndrainage area above this dam would be approximately 4 square miles. This\r\nis a comparatively small amount of storage, yet it would provide for all\r\nflood catchment in that comparatively limited area and would be of\r\nassistance at times in compensating the dry flow of the Pequanac.\r\n\r\n\r\nROCKAWAY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nRockaway River offers a greater number of available reservoir sites than\r\neither of the other highland tributaries of the Passaic. Some of the\r\nreservoirs which could be constructed could be used solely as catchment\r\nareas to hold back flood waters, while the capacity of others would be\r\nso much greater than any single flood run-off that they might serve also\r\nas compensating reservoirs. A large dam is now in process of erection at\r\nOld Boonton, conserving a considerable amount for the water for the\r\nmunicipal supply of Jersey City. This reservoir can not be depended upon\r\nas a flood-catchment area, as it will be the aim of those in authority\r\nto maintain the water in it as high as possible.\r\n\r\n_Powerville reservoir_.--A short distance above Boonton the erection of\r\na comparatively small dam would flood a large, irregular, flat basin\r\nhaving an area of a little more than 4-1/2 square miles and extending up\r\nthe Rockaway Valley to Rockaway Village, up Beaver Brook to Beech Glen,\r\nand north and south for considerable distances. The probable capacity of\r\nthis reservoir has been estimated, and it is fairly certain that it is\r\nconsiderably more than would be sufficient for flood catchment. Its\r\nconstruction would, moreover, improve the entire valley and be of\r\nadvantage to many interests.\r\n\r\nThe northern New Jersey flood commission has selected for investigation\r\na reservoir site on Rockaway River at Powerville. By the erection of a\r\ndam across the stream at this point, 28 feet in height and 470 feet\r\nlong, a reservoir 4.6 square miles in area, with a capacity of\r\n1,565,000,000 cubic feet, would be afforded. The drainage area above\r\nthis point is 114 square miles. The cost of such a reservoir is\r\nestimated at $600,000.\r\n\r\nNorth from Powerville, near the confines of the proposed Powerville\r\nreservoir, there is an available reservoir site along Stony Brook. By\r\nthe erection of a dam 1,100 feet long and 120 feet high a lake would be\r\nformed 645 acres in extent, which would serve as a flood-catchment basin\r\nand a compensating reservoir. This reservoir would hold approximately\r\n850,000,000 cubic feet. The construction of a reservoir at this place\r\noffers no engineering difficulties, and the project may be regarded as\r\nextremely favorable.\r\n\r\nDixons Pond, west of Rockaway Valley and northwest of Powerville, is a\r\nsmall sheet of water which lies in a valley which might be flooded to a\r\ngreater height. By the erection of a dam 450 feet long and 30 feet high\r\na lake of 136 acres would be created, which would form a part of the\r\nflood catchment and compensating service.\r\n\r\n_Longwood Valley reservoir_.--A large storage basin is afforded in\r\nLongwood Valley which, if developed to its full extent, would extend\r\nfrom a point about a mile below Lower Longwood 7 miles up the headwaters\r\nand reach to about 1-1/2 miles above Petersburg. An alternative\r\nproposition is afforded which involves the submerging of less than half\r\nthis area.\r\n\r\nA dam 800 feet long and 55 feet high might be erected across a gorge\r\nabout 1 mile south of Petersburg. There would be formed a lake of about\r\n1.247 square miles, or 800 acres in extent. The hamlet of Petersburg\r\nwould be submerged, but the damages from the destruction of improved\r\nproperty would not be very great, as the improvements and the land are\r\nnot especially valuable. This reservoir would have a capacity of about\r\n964,000,000 cubic feet and the surface would be at a height of 800 feet\r\nabove sea level.\r\n\r\nThe alternative plan, that of using a longer stretch of the valley for\r\nreservoir purposes, would involve the construction about 1 mile below\r\nLower Longwood of a dam 1,300 feet long and 110 feet high. The reservoir\r\nthus formed would be 1,900 acres in extent and contain approximately\r\n3,447,000,000 cubic feet. The drainage area above this dam is limited,\r\nand if the reservoir were drawn down to an amount equivalent to 15\r\ninches upon the drainage area there would still remain an enormous\r\namount of water which could be used in a compensatory way to tide over\r\ndry seasons.\r\n\r\n_Splitrock Pond._--By erecting a dam 550 feet long and 30 feet high\r\nacross a gorge at the outlet of Splitrock Pond, a lake could be formed\r\nhaving an area of 625 acres and adding to the present storage capacity\r\nof the lake an amount approximately equal to 475,000,000 cubic feet,\r\nequivalent to 38.75 inches on the drainage area.\r\n\r\nThus it is seen that if this reservoir were drawn down an amount\r\nequivalent to 15 inches on the drainage area, which would without doubt\r\ngive sufficient protection from all floods, there would still remain a\r\nstorage capacity of 23.75 inches for compensating purposes in addition\r\nto the amount now available in Splitrock Pond. This project is one of\r\nthe most attractive in the Rockaway Basin, as the damages which would be\r\ncaused by flooding would be, comparatively speaking, nil. The property\r\nis, however, now owned by the East Jersey Water Company, and is prized\r\nhighly as a reservoir site by that corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPPER PASSAIC BASIN.\r\n\r\n_Millington reservoir._--There is an area of swamp land, comprising a\r\npart of the drainage area of upper Passaic River above Millington, which\r\nis known as Great Passaic Swamp. It is bounded on the south by a long,\r\nnarrow trap ridge known as Long Hill, the summit of which ranges from\r\n400 to 500 feet in elevation, or roughly 200 feet above the border of\r\nthis swamp. To the northwest the land rises gradually toward Trowbridge\r\nMountains, while to the northeast is the terminal moraine. The outlet of\r\nPassaic River at Millington is by a narrow gorge, which offers natural\r\nfacilities for the erection of a dam.\r\n\r\nThe whole situation is exceptionally good, and the surface of a\r\nreservoir might be fixed at any elevation between 240 and 300 feet above\r\nsea level. With the surface of the reservoir at 300 feet a dam 1,600\r\nfeet long and 90 feet high would be required. This lake would have an\r\narea of 28.46 square miles. The drainage area above Millington has,\r\nhowever, an area of only 53.6 square miles, and the proposed reservoir\r\nwould therefore cover more than half of this. Therefore the conservation\r\nof so large a quantity of water would not be necessary nor advisable,\r\nunless the beautifying of the surrounding country were an object to be\r\ntaken into consideration, which might be profitable.\r\n\r\nA better project, however, would be to construct a dam at Millington 900\r\nfeet long and 50 feet high, the crest being about 260 feet above sea\r\nlevel. There would be formed a lake with an area of 19.41 square miles,\r\nand a capacity of 1,477,600,000 cubic feet, equal to 9.864 feet on the\r\ndrainage area. This project is too great for the necessities here\r\npresented, and would not be wisely considered unless it were found\r\nadvantageous to improve the country generally as a place of suburban\r\nresidence. The land which would be flooded with the reservoir crest at\r\n260 feet is of a wet, swampy character, and its value for agricultural\r\npurposes is somewhat doubtful. Such construction would involve the\r\nflooding of 13 miles of road, which, however, would not involve a great\r\nloss of invested capital, as the roads generally are of a poor\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nA second alternative would involve the construction of a dam across the\r\nMillington gorge, 550 feet long and 30 feet high, raising the water to\r\n240 feet above sea level and creating a lake of 14.40 square miles. This\r\nwould conserve 4,026,000,000 cubic feet, equal to 2.69 feet on the\r\ndrainage area. This would be ample for flood purposes and would still\r\nafford a large impounded area, as the drawing off of an amount equal to\r\n10 or even 15 inches on the watershed would not reduce the size of the\r\nlake to any great extent.\r\n\r\nThe whole project here presented involves few difficulties, and as the\r\ndrainage area above is of small extent, the mere question of conserving\r\nthe flood waters could be met without great difficulty. The natural\r\nadvantages, however, are so great and the land included within Great\r\nPassaic Swamp is of so little value that the surrounding country would\r\nbe improved and beautified by the construction of such a reservoir. The\r\nopportunity for varying the character of the reservoir to meet the ideas\r\nof those interested seems unexampled, and as a whole it presents an\r\nextremely interesting field which may be profitably exploited.\r\n\r\n\r\nSADDLE RIVER.\r\n\r\nThis stream has been described in the report on the flood of 1902,\r\nalready referred to. It contributes a large amount of water to the main\r\nartery of the Passaic below Dundee dam, and as the river channel at that\r\npoint is overburdened under the present conditions because of lack of\r\nslope and numerous catchments, together with what is known as the\r\nWallington Bend, it increases very materially the damage caused by\r\nfloods.\r\n\r\nThe most effectual remedy in the case of Saddle River floods is that of\r\nconstruction of flood catchments. No studies have been made of the\r\nsituation in the Saddle River drainage area, but a superficial\r\ninspection of the basin shows that opportunities for the construction of\r\nflood-catchment reservoirs are not numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF FLOOD-CATCHMENT PROJECTS.\r\n\r\nBy following the plans described in the preceding pages absolute flood\r\ncatchments may be provided above Little Falls on the Passaic Basin for\r\n551.7 square miles, leaving only 221.2 square miles from which flood\r\nrun-off would flow immediately. The accomplishment of this would involve\r\nthe construction of Pompton reservoir, which would withhold all flood\r\nwaters from the northern tributaries. It would leave unprovided for 20.2\r\nsquare miles on the Rockaway, 71.7 square miles on the Whippany, 46.2\r\nsquare miles on the upper Passaic, and 83.7 square miles tributary to\r\nthe Central Basin and not included above.\r\n\r\nLeaving Pompton reservoir out of consideration, and conserving flood\r\nrun-off on the Ramapo, Wanaque, and Pequanac rivers, there would be\r\nabsolute flood catchment up to a 12-inch run-off over 494.8 square miles\r\nabove Little Falls. This would leave 278.1 square miles unprovided for,\r\nthe run-off from which would not overburden the channel in the lower\r\nvalley, provided, of course, that channel were improved to a maximum\r\ncarrying capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFERABLE RESERVOIR SITES.\r\n\r\nThe following table and discussion of preferable sites for flood\r\nprevention are taken from the report of the engineering committee of the\r\nnorthern New Jersey flood commission:\r\n\r\nTable showing detailed facts regarding possible reservoir sites on\r\nPassaic drainage basin.\r\n\r\nKEY:\r\nA: Area of watershed.\r\nB: Area of reservoir.\r\nC: Height of dam.\r\nD: Length of dam.\r\nE: Elevation of flow line.\r\nF: Storage, watershed.\r\nG: Storage capacity.\r\nH: Total cost.\r\n\r\n--------------+-----+------+-----+------+------+-------+-------+---------\r\nReservoir.    |  A  |  B   | C   |   D  |   E  |   F   |  G    |   H\r\n--------------+-----+------+-----+------+------+-------+-------+---------\r\n              | Sq. | Sq.  |Feet.| Feet.| Feet.|Inches.|Million|\r\n              | mi. | mi.  |     |      |      |       | c.f.  |\r\nRamapo        | 140 |  2.8 | 65  | 1,700| 280  |   5.5 | 1,768 | $900,000\r\nWanaque       |  83 |  2.1 | 60  | 1,200| 275  |   7.7 | 1,491 |1,000,000\r\nNewfoundland  |  52 |  1.8 | 40  |   430| 780  |   8   |   966 |1,800,000\r\nRockaway      | 114 |  4.6 | 28  |   470| 520  |   6   | 1,565 |  600,000\r\nMillington    |  56 | 15.8 | 25  |   220| 245  |  31   | 4,060 |  370,000\r\nGreat Piece   | 773 |  37  | 21  | 1,500| 178.5|   9[C]| 8,950 |2,625,000\r\nMountain View | 380 | 13.4 | 42  | 2,150| 202  |   8   | 7,200 |3,340,000\r\n  Do.         | 380 | 13.9 | 44  | 2,380| 204  |   9   | 7,900 |3,460,000\r\n  Do.         | 380 | 14.3 | 46  | 2,470| 206  |  10   | 8,700 |3,590,000\r\n  Do.         | 380 | 17.4 | 60  | 3,000| 220  |  17   |15,000 |5,260,000\r\n--------------+-----+------+-----+------+------+-------+-------+---------\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: Including water discharged through fixed openings,\r\nin a flood similar to that of October, 1903.\r\nMaximum discharge, 12,000 cubic feet per second.]\r\n\r\n     With the exception of the Millington reservoir site where the cost\r\n     of the dam is a small factor, the elevation of flow line in the\r\n     various reservoirs which determines the capacity was fixed so as to\r\n     afford an approximate storage equal to a run-off of about 8 inches\r\n     from the drainage area above each dam site. This amount is somewhat\r\n     in excess of the run-off for the flood of October, 1903. It was\r\n     found impracticable on the Rockaway reservoir site to provide for a\r\n     storage greater than 6 inches. On the Wanaque the amount which can\r\n     be stored falls slightly under 8 inches, while on the Ramapo it is\r\n     possible to obtain only 5-1/2 inches, by reason of the fact that\r\n     with a greater storage capacity the slack water would reach into\r\n     New York State. The economical height for a dam at the lower end of\r\n     the Great Piece Meadow, if such dam is provided with fixed\r\n     discharge openings which will carry a maximum outflow of 12,000\r\n     cubic feet per second, will provide a reservoir which will dispose\r\n     of a run-off of 9 inches on the drainage area above.\r\n\r\n     The following combinations of reservoir sites, with their\r\n     respective drainage areas, proportional storage, and estimated\r\n     costs, give the facts necessary for final deductions:\r\n\r\n--------------+---------------+-----------+---------------+-----------\r\n              | Drainage      |  Water    |  Equivalent   |\r\n  Site.       |  area.        |collected. |     area      |   Cost.\r\n              |               |           |   retarded.   |\r\n--------------+---------------+-----------+---------------+-----------\r\n              |_Square miles._| _Inches._ |_Square miles._|\r\nRamapo        |          140  |      5.5  |        96.25  |   $900,000\r\nWanaque       |           83  |      7.7  |        80     |  1,000,000\r\nPequanac      |           52  |      8    |        52     |  1,800,000\r\nRockaway      |          114  |      6    |        85.5   |    600,000\r\n              |---------------+-----------+----------------+----------\r\nTotal         |          389  |           |       313.75  |  4,300,000\r\n              |=======================================================\r\nRamapo        |          140  |      5.5  |        96.25  |    900,000\r\nWanaque       |           83  |      7.7  |        80     |  1,000,000\r\nRockaway      |          114  |       6   |        85.5   |    600,000\r\nMillington    |           56  |      31   |        56     |    370,000\r\nTotal         |          393  |           |       317.75  |  3,870,000\r\n              |=======================================================\r\nGreat Piece   |          773  |      4.5  |       435     |  2,625,000\r\nMountain View |          380  |       8   |       380     |  3,340,000\r\n--------------+---------------+-----------+---------------+-----------\r\n\r\n     The necessity to retard the flow of or provide storage for\r\n     approximately 380 square miles of highland drainage area has been\r\n     determined after careful study, and there has been deduced an\r\n     amount which may safely be expected to represent the maximum for\r\n     the highest floods. When the highland tributaries are sufficiently\r\n     checked the natural storage on Great Piece Meadow in its effect\r\n     upon flood control becomes more apparent. Our investigations show\r\n     that the holding back of the flood flow--that is, 8 inches run-off\r\n     on approximately 380 square miles of flashy drainage area above\r\n     Great Piece Meadow--is necessary to reduce the discharge in the\r\n     river through the city of Paterson to 14,000 cubic feet per second\r\n     for a flood similar to that of 1903.\r\n\r\n     From the foregoing table, in which different reservoir projects are\r\n     compared, it is seen that only the reservoirs designated as Great\r\n     Piece and Mountain View will fulfill the requirements within a\r\n     reasonable limit of cost. It is also shown that a combination of\r\n     any other available sites would involve the expenditure of more\r\n     money for their construction and the control of less tributary\r\n     drainage area than is fulfilled by the demands of the Passaic\r\n     drainage basin. We are therefore brought to the conclusion that\r\n     only two of the projects above set forth will be effective. First,\r\n     the construction of a regulating dam on the main stream above\r\n     Little Falls, which we have called the \"Great Piece\" Meadow\r\n     Reservoir, and second, the building of a dam at Mountain View\r\n     across Pompton River. The relative cost of these reservoirs,\r\n     constructed for flood control exclusively, is $2,625,000 for that\r\n     on Great Piece Meadow and $3,340,000 for the Mountain View site.\r\n     Details of these estimates are as follows:\r\n\r\n_Estimate of cost of Great Piece Reservoir, dam at Little Falls._\r\n\r\n[Elevation of flow line, 178.5 feet.

The dam across\r\n     Passaic River above Little Falls would be provided with apertures\r\n     which would discharge 12,000 cubic feet per second under the\r\n     maximum head in the storage basin.

In making\r\n     such recommendations the committee is of the opinion that it must\r\n     take into account matters of engineering policy with regard to\r\n     future needs and contingencies, as well as the bare necessities of\r\n     the present.\r\n\r\n     If there were none other than the single problem of prevention the\r\n     committee would advise the construction of the reservoir on Great\r\n     Piece Meadow by reason of its smaller probable cost and its equal\r\n     efficiency. It is plain, however, that there are many important\r\n     features of public policy involved in the subject at hand.\r\n     Population in the valley of the Passaic is developing so rapidly\r\n     that in only a few years the present sources of water supply will\r\n     be inadequate. The whole subject of water supply for northern New\r\n     Jersey demands immediate consideration, and it would not be wise to\r\n     take up the matter of prevention of flood damage in the Passaic\r\n     without basing the value of every project upon its adaptability\r\n     for use in future water-supply needs.\r\n\r\n     By expending $2,600,000 a great reservoir could be constructed upon\r\n     Great Piece Meadow which could not be adapted for any purposes\r\n     except to regulate floods; it would stand in season and out of\r\n     season a huge feature of the valley and entirely useless and\r\n     inoperative save on the occasion of high water. However great might\r\n     be the needs of the inhabitants of the Passaic Valley for a\r\n     conserved water supply, the construction on the meadows,\r\n     representing an enormous expenditure, would furnish no solution of\r\n     the problem. It would admit of no enlargement for water-supply\r\n     storage and would be available for no purpose except flood\r\n     regulation.\r\n\r\n     When we consider the Mountain View project, however, we find that\r\n     as a measure for the prevention of flood damages it fulfills all\r\n     the requirements and provides in addition all the possibilities and\r\n     advantages demanded inevitably in the near future. The Mountain\r\n     View site is an ideal one for the reservoir, and its initial\r\n     development for flood catchment does not involve the expenditure of\r\n     a dollar that would be lost in the development of the basin to\r\n     greater capacities for water supply. From its lowest level, at 202\r\n     feet above tide, to its maximum capacity, at a level of 220, there\r\n     would be no depreciation. Every dollar spent in the initial\r\n     construction would be effective in the maximum development.\r\n\r\n     The probable cost of Mountain View reservoir, estimated at\r\n     $3,340,000, exceeds that of Great Piece by $700,000. It is realized\r\n     that to many persons this margin may seem very wide. Let us\r\n     consider briefly just what it really represents.\r\n\r\n     Suppose, for example, that the Great Piece project is constructed\r\n     at a cost of $2,600,000. After the elapse of a few years it will be\r\n     necessary to provide additional storage in the Passaic highlands\r\n     for water supply or the maintenance of water power. The Mountain\r\n     View reservoir, or its equivalent in capacity and cost, will then\r\n     be necessary. The situation will then be as follows: By\r\n     constructing the Great Piece reservoir in preference to the\r\n     Mountain View for flood catchment, $700,000 would be saved. We can\r\n     consider that this amount might be expended to pay a part of the\r\n     cost of additional conservation above referred to. If, on the other\r\n     hand, Mountain View had been constructed, there would have been\r\n     paid on the final cost of conservance the sum of $3,340,000, which,\r\n     as stated in previous pages, would also have effected flood relief.\r\n     There would then be the difference between $2,600,000 and $700,000,\r\n     or $1,900,000, which represents the actual loss which would accrue\r\n     by reason of the construction of Great Piece reservoir.\r\n\r\n     The engineering committee, after presenting the merits of both\r\n     Great Piece Meadow and Mountain View projects, therefore recommends\r\n     the adoption of the latter in spite of its greater cost, because it\r\n     is believed that in the end the construction of the Great Piece\r\n     project would involve an expenditure not warranted by public\r\n     economy or general expediency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Great floods in the Passaic Basin arise only after a specially\r\nviolent precipitation.\r\n\r\n2. Under present conditions floods may be expected at frequent\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\n3. A part of the damage along the lower valley is the result of\r\nencroachments on the part of individuals and public and private\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\n4. The channel in the lower valley may be improved at certain points by\r\nstraightening it and judiciously making cut-offs.\r\n\r\n5. Without the construction of numerous levees the lower valley channel\r\ncan not be made to carry great flood waters without damage.\r\n\r\n6. Immunity from floods can be effected only by the construction of\r\ncatchment reservoirs in the highlands or levees in the lowlands.\r\n\r\n7. Levee construction would involve more damage than is now caused by\r\nfloods, and the cost thereof would be prohibitive.\r\n\r\n8. Flood catchment reservoirs may be constructed economically and\r\nprovide storage to compensate for the dry-season flow, thereby\r\nmaintaining water power at Paterson, Passaic, and other points, and\r\nproviding for municipal water supply in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nArch street bridge, Paterson, destruction of; 27\r\n\r\n\r\nBeattie's dam, flood flow at; 16-17\r\n  flood period at; 9\r\n  view of; 16\r\n\r\nBridges, destruction of; 26-27\r\n\r\n\r\nCapacity of streams, increase in; 28\r\n\r\nCentral Basin, damage in; 24\r\n  flood in, descent of; 14-15\r\n\r\nCharlotteburg, rainfall at; 11, 12\r\n\r\nChatham, flood period at; 10\r\n\r\nChester, rainfall at; 11\r\n\r\nCranberry Pond, dam at, failure of; 24\r\n\r\n\r\nDamages, discussion of; 23-28\r\n\r\nDarlington, reservoir site at; 33\r\n\r\nDixons Pond, reservoir site at; 37\r\n\r\nDover, rainfall at; 11, 12\r\n\r\nDrought, relation of rainfall to; 12\r\n\r\nDundee dam, flood flow over; 17-22\r\n  flood flow over, diagram showing; 20\r\n  flood period at; 9\r\n  floods at, comparison of, figure showing; 18\r\n\r\n\r\nEast Jersey Water Company, damage at pumping station of; 25-26\r\n\r\nElizabeth, rainfall at; 11\r\n\r\nEssex Fells, rainfall at; 11, 12\r\n\r\n\r\nFlood, descent of; 14-22\r\n  period of; 9-10\r\n  prevention of; 28-44\r\n\r\nFlood damage, plates showing; 26, 28\r\n\r\nFloods, general conclusions concerning; 44-45\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat Passaic Swamp, reservoir site at; 38-39\r\n\r\nGreat Piece reservoir, cost of, estimate of; 42\r\n\r\nGreenwood Lake, use of; 34\r\n\r\n\r\nHanover, rainfall at; 11\r\n\r\nHebrew quarter, Paterson, devastation in, plate showing; 28\r\n\r\nHighland tributaries, damages along; 23-25\r\n  descent of flood in; 14-15\r\n\r\nHotel, wreck of, plate showing; 26\r\n\r\nLittle Falls, dam at, view of; 16\r\n  damage at; 25-26\r\n  flood flow at; 16-17\r\n  flood period at; 9\r\n  rainfall at; 12\r\n\r\nLongwood Valley, reservoir site in; 37\r\n\r\nLower Longwood, reservoir site near; 38\r\n\r\nLower Valley, damage in; 25-28\r\n  improvements in, discussion of; 29-31\r\n\r\nLudlum Steel and Iron Company, water front of; 24\r\n\r\n\r\nMacopin dam, flood flow at; 15-16\r\n  flood period at; 10\r\n\r\nMain street bridge, Paterson, destruction of; 27\r\n\r\nMidvale, proposed reservoir near; 34\r\n\r\nMill district, Paterson, effects of flood in, plate showing; 26\r\n\r\nMillington, reservoir site near; 38-39, 40\r\n\r\nMountain View, reservoir site at; 31-33, 40\r\n\r\nMountain View reservoir, cost of, estimate of; 43\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York City, rainfall at; 11, 13\r\n\r\nNewark, rainfall at; 11, 12, 13\r\n\r\nNewark water department, information furnished by; 16\r\n\r\nNewell, F.
