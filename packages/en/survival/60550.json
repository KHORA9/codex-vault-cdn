In another, the loam will become very sandy, and the earth\r\nlight, with a slight greenish tinge. A third has thin pebble or gravel\r\nbeds developed, or small stones sparingly scattered in the clays and\r\nloams on certain horizons. A fourth contains, in addition to some of\r\nthe beds above described, a lime-clay or marl[1] with small pellets\r\nof chalk. It will be noticed on entering the yards that these various\r\nhorizons, or beds, as they are conveniently termed, are disposed in\r\nregular lines or layers, more or less horizontal; in other words, the\r\nbeds are “stratified.” On the face of the working being dug into, it\r\nwill often be found that these thin beds, a few inches or feet each\r\nin thickness, vary in depth, and frequently disappear altogether, or\r\n“thin out,” whilst, on the other hand, a bed only a few inches thick\r\nmay become as many feet, and new beds are found to be developed. A\r\npure sand may in like manner become loamy on being dug into, and, on\r\nbeing further developed, pass insensibly into a stiff clay. And many\r\nother changes take place into which we will not enquire at the moment.\r\nSuffice it to say, that in such brickyards the strata are very locally\r\ndeveloped, though it follows from the circumstance of their existence\r\nfor so many years, that what changes have taken place, to some extent\r\ncompensate each other, so that the material is still an earth suitable\r\nfor making bricks. Again, certain beds of much economic value may be\r\nmore persistent than others, both in character and development. Having\r\nnoticed all these things, we perceive a couple of men digging with care\r\ninto the brick-earth, and presently they bring some objects to us which\r\nwe have no difficulty in recognizing as the remains of the lower jaw\r\nof an elephant’s skull. Returning to the spot where they were exhumed,\r\nthe upper jaw and tusks also are uncovered. To the clay workers these\r\nthings are well known; in their time they have found many similar\r\nskulls of animals in the brick-earth; but they know next to nothing\r\nconcerning them, or how they got there. Another expedition to the same\r\nlocalities may yield the remains of rhinoceros, the musk sheep, grizzly\r\nbear, hippopotamus, reindeer, and many other animals. A fine series of\r\nthe remains of these, obtained from the brick-earths of the valley of\r\nthe Thames at several points, is exhibited in the geological department\r\nof the British Museum (Natural History), South Kensington, and more\r\nor less complete skeletons obtained from the same source may be found\r\nin other, and local museums. One of the most interesting points\r\nconcerning these remains is that so many of the animals represented\r\nin the brick-earths are of extinct species--there are no species\r\nincluded in this latter category of precisely similar kinds to animals\r\nnow living, Thus the elephant was different to modern elephants; we\r\nknow, from remains found elsewhere, that it was clothed with wool. The\r\nsame also with the rhinoceros. The reindeer no longer lives in this\r\ncountry, being confined to northerly latitudes; whilst the musk sheep\r\nis a denizen of the Arctic regions, and the hippopotamus is restricted\r\nto the tropical or sub-tropical climes. But we might continue for a\r\nlong time expatiating on the character of the very numerous mammalian\r\nremains found in our common brick-earths. What a curious assemblage of\r\nanimals! It is wonderful to contemplate the time when the reindeer and\r\nmusk sheep lived side by side with the elephant and rhinoceros on the\r\nsite whereon London now stands.\r\n\r\nThat is not all, however. In the same brick-earths and gravels, tools\r\n(flint implements), fashioned by the hands of man, are also frequently\r\ndiscovered, and in one place at Crayford, the spot whereon flint\r\nimplements were manufactured has been ’lighted upon. Each flake chipped\r\noff has been collected and pieced together, and the shape of the\r\noriginal flint has thus been determined. Clearly, from this evidence,\r\nthe earth from which millions of bricks have been made has formed\r\nsince primæval man (and with him the animals alluded to) inhabited\r\nthe valleys of the Thames and its tributaries. It is interesting, too,\r\nto reflect on the circumstance that the materials upon which many of\r\nthese facts of great philosophical significance are based, have been\r\ncollected through the instrumentality of the workmen. Palæontologists\r\nare proud to acknowledge that; their debt of gratitude to the\r\nintelligent and persevering men can never be fully repaid.\r\n\r\nPursuing the matter still further, we discover a quantity of shells,\r\nblanched and very frail--they seem to be deprived of much of their\r\noriginal substance, so to speak; their entombment in the brick-earth\r\nhas taken all the natural colour out of them. Studying these, we soon\r\nascertain that they belong to land snails and mollusca which inhabit\r\nfresh water. Living representatives of the same species are, with few\r\nexceptions, found in Kent and Essex.\r\n\r\nPutting all this evidence together, we come to the conclusion that the\r\nbrick-earths alluded to accumulated in the channel of a river; they are\r\nfound above the present level of the Thames, for the simple reason that\r\nthey have been elevated into that position partly by earth movements\r\nand partly by the channel of the river being cut deeper by natural\r\ncauses, of which abundant proof will be adduced. The snails were washed\r\ndown from the land by freshets, or caught by the river in flood; the\r\nelephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, and musk sheep were overcome,\r\nperhaps, by floods, drowned, and subsequently covered up by the mud\r\nof the swollen current. We can imagine that the savage hunter, in his\r\ncanoe, attacking the animals swimming in the river, loses his tomahawk,\r\nor his frail bark may be upset, and he is striving to gain the shore\r\nfor dear life. Or, it may be winter time; the river is frozen over,\r\nand he is cutting a hole in the ice with his flint chisel wherein to\r\nfish; his hands are benumbed, and he loses his grasp of the tool; it\r\nfalls into the water, to be discovered in the brick-earth by one of our\r\nintelligent friends. Truly, the revelations of the brickyard enable us\r\nto construct a picture of one of the most interesting phases of the\r\npast history of the Earth.\r\n\r\nWe have given an outline of the evidence upon which certain\r\nbrick-earths in the Thames valley are proved to be of fresh-water\r\norigin--to have accumulated in quiet reaches of the river, and at\r\nother convenient spots along its course--but we have used that as\r\nan illustration only; phenomena of precisely the same character are\r\nmanifested in nearly all river valleys in this country, especially\r\nthose in which the bottom of the valley has only a slight gradient down\r\nto the sea.\r\n\r\nThe brickmaker may ask: What is the practical bearing of these\r\nobservations? What difference does it make to us whether the earths\r\nwe use are of fresh-water, lacustrine, or marine origin? All the\r\ndifference in the world, from the points of view of structure,\r\ncomposition and suitability of the earths, and especially of their\r\ndistribution over the face of the country. How much easier it is to\r\nvalue an extensive brickmaking property when you feel perfectly certain\r\nas to whether the face of earth as shown in the pit will die out on\r\nbeing worked into for a few yards, or whether it will be persistent\r\nthroughout the whole of the property to be valued. Better still, when\r\nyour knowledge enables you to state definitely whether the quality of\r\nearth now being worked in a pit is likely to continue the same, or\r\nwhether it will get better, or worse. The disposition of the earths, in\r\nsome instances, is so clear that no brickmaker with an eye to business\r\ncould fail to trace their extent over his property. But this is not\r\noften the case, for the earths being used are for the most part covered\r\nby a superficial mantle, or overburden, which masks the true character\r\nof the beds beneath. A very slight acquaintance with the principles of\r\ngeology overcomes these difficulties as a rule; and we are about to\r\nlay down the elements of these principles, so far as they apply to the\r\nimmediate subject in hand. By seeing why it is the beds of brick-earth\r\nvary in structure and composition we shall be in a better position to\r\nmake forecasts of their general behaviour.\r\n\r\nIn regard to fluviatile deposits, it goes without saying that every\r\nriver flows along a general depression more or less pronounced, called\r\na valley, and that this valley is bounded physiographically by a ridge,\r\nexcept in the region of its entrance to the sea or lake, or, if a\r\ntributary, of its joining a main stream. The watershed of a river and\r\nits tributaries includes and comprises what is technically termed the\r\n“river basin.” All valleys are, in the end, the result of denudation\r\ntaking place in them. In other words, on the birth of a valley a very\r\nslight depression or other physical feature determined its general\r\ndirection for the time being, but the little rivulet once being\r\nformed proceeded, through the medium of the “agents of denudation,”\r\nto carve out its channel more clearly, and eventually to eat into the\r\nrocks over which it flowed, until a large valley had been formed. The\r\n“agents of denudation” in river valleys may be summarised as rain,\r\nsnow, ice, heat, and wind, and their general effect on rocks is called\r\n“weathering.” We need not stop to enquire into the precise methods\r\nadopted by these agents in accomplishing their work; it suffices at\r\npresent to say that the rock destroyed or broken up is removed by the\r\nrunning water constituting the rivulet, stream, or river, as the case\r\nmay be. Some of the material is chemically dissolved in the water,\r\nwhilst another and larger proportion is taken away in suspension, or\r\nis said to be dealt with mechanically by the river. The agents of\r\ndenudation do their work very slowly, as a rule, and yet no one who\r\nstands on London Bridge and contemplates the swollen stream laden with\r\nmuddy sediment passing under it after a few days’ rain, could say that\r\nthey are not doing their duty effectually. To give some idea of the\r\nquantity of sand, gravel, and mud removed from the land through the\r\nmedium of rivers, we may remark that the Mississippi discharges into\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico annually a mass of earthy matter equal to a prism\r\n268 feet in height with a base area of one square mile. In regard to\r\ndenudation by chemical means we may say that the Thames carries past\r\nKingston 19 grains of mineral salts in every gallon of water, or a\r\ntotal of 1,502 tons every 24 hours, or 548,230 tons every year; this is\r\nnot taking into account the muddy sediment, gravel, &c., annually sent\r\ndown to the Nore, which must be infinitely greater in quantity.\r\n\r\nEnough has now been said to show that stupendous quantities of mineral\r\nmatter derived from the destruction of the land are sent down to the\r\nsea by natural agencies, and we may at once state that a very large\r\nproportion of this, which finds a resting-place in and about the\r\nmouths of the rivers and their backwaters, is material suitable for\r\nbrickmaking at places where it is obtainable. Enormous quantities of\r\nmuddy sediment, sand and gravel, however, never reach as far as the\r\nsea with great rivers. This material is arrested at sundry convenient\r\nspots, and, as a rule, forms excellent brick-earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Formation of Brick-earth in a river valley.]\r\n\r\nSee Fig. 1, which represents part of a river of slow current with\r\nthree bends, A, B, C. The water is flowing in the direction indicated\r\nby the arrows; and it is part of the mechanics of such a river that in\r\nrounding a bend its velocity is greatest (and its eroding power also)\r\nat the outer portions of the curves approximately indicated by the\r\narrow points. The water “wheels round” such portions of the curves,\r\nand “marks time” at the points _x_ _x_ _x_, and, indeed, its progress\r\nmay be altogether arrested for a time at the latter places. Now the\r\ntransporting power of a river is its velocity, and, naturally, the\r\ngreater the velocity, the coarser will be the fragments or particles\r\nof rock carried along. It is interesting in this connection to quote\r\nthe figures calculated by Mr. David Stephenson, giving the power of\r\ntransport of different velocities of river currents:--\r\n\r\n  Ins. per  Mile per\r\n  second.    hour.\r\n     3   =  0.170   will just begin to work on fine clay.\r\n     6   =  0.340   will lift fine sand.\r\n     8   =  0.4545  sand as coarse as linseed.\r\n    12   =  0.6819  will sweep along fine gravel.\r\n    24   =  1.3638  will roll along rounded pebbles 1 inch in diameter.\r\n    36   =  2.045   will sweep along slippery angular stones of the\r\n                      size of an egg.\r\n\r\nThese figures[2] have greater interest for us than in the connection\r\nat present used, as will be noticed hereafter. We have seen that in\r\nrounding the bends (Fig. 1) A, B, C, different portions of the stream\r\npossess different velocities. We know it is charged with sediment and\r\nstones all the time. The tendency, therefore, will be for the large\r\nstones and coarse detritus to go round the outer side of the bend, to\r\nbombard the banks near the points shown by the arrows, and to erode the\r\nchannel deepest in those situations; whilst a goodly proportion of the\r\nfine muddy sediment will find its way to the quiet and shallow parts\r\nnear _x x x_, and in course of time become deposited there, whilst the\r\nmain course of the stream is eating its way and shifting its course\r\nas indicated by the dotted lines _a a_. This action proceeds, it may\r\nbe, until the course of the river becomes straighter, as shown by the\r\ndotted lines _b b_, when the whole of the loop B D is abandoned, its\r\nformer course there being evidenced by pools of water and irregular\r\nheaps of gravel, sand and mud. The reader will now see that the whole\r\nof the land marked _x x x_ has been formed of sediment brought down\r\nby the river, and in the majority of cases such fine silt and sandy\r\nmud or clay is specially suitable for brickmaking--many of our largest\r\nbrickmakers obtain their material from such a source. It should be\r\nobserved that the valley, as shown between the lines _v v_, may be two\r\nor three miles in width, and it is often much more, so that the actual\r\namount of land made by the river at _x x x_ may be several thousands of\r\nacres in extent.\r\n\r\nNow as to the practical application of the foregoing observations. In\r\nthe first place, it will be seen that such deposits of brick-earth as\r\nare made in this manner cannot be very thick, their total thickness\r\nperhaps, resting on the bottom of the valley, not being more than 20\r\nfeet, and it is frequently much less. The next thing to be noticed is\r\nthat they must be very variable in character, a bed changing perhaps\r\nevery 100 feet or so horizontally, and more often every few feet.\r\nIndividual beds must of necessity be very irregularly developed under\r\nthe circumstances. The velocity of the stream being greater at certain\r\nseasons of the year than at others, we frequently find some such\r\nsection as the following developed:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Section of Fluviatile Brick-earth.]\r\n\r\n  _a_ = Mould and soil, of no use to the brickmaker.\r\n\r\n  _b_ = Sandy clay, with a large proportion of sand; useful for\r\n          moulding or incorporating with the “fat” clays below for\r\n          brickmaking.\r\n\r\n  _c_ = Gravel bed, lenticularly developed; suitable for mending\r\n          roads, paths, &c.\r\n\r\n  _d_ = Sandy clay; similar to _b_.\r\n\r\n  _e_ = Thin bed of marl, with a fair proportion of lime.\r\n\r\n  _f_ = Sands and small pebbles, irregularly stratified\r\n          (false-bedded).\r\n\r\n  _g_ = Laminated sandy clay.\r\n\r\n  _h_ = Stiff clay; can be mixed with _f_ and passed through the\r\n          pug mill.\r\n\r\n  _i_ = Sand; an irregular bed of very local occurrence.\r\n\r\n  _j_ = Gravel bed, with much sand.\r\n\r\nThe above is typical of deposits accumulated in river valleys; it\r\nis different in character to deposits laid down in the sea (as will\r\npresently be described); the section exhibits very different classes\r\nof brick-earth also, and yields a totally different kind of brick to\r\nthat obtainable from brick-earths of marine origin. The importance of\r\nthe question of origin of a brick-earth, therefore, is just beginning\r\nto dawn upon us. Many rivers are noted as having throughout a long\r\nperiod of time wandered from one side of the valley to the other (by\r\nthe process depicted in Fig. 1) several times, in which cases the\r\nbrick-earth sections relating to them are liable to still greater\r\nvariation. The reader would perhaps be very much astonished to find how\r\nmuch is known concerning peregrinations of that description in regard\r\nto particular localities, by competent authorities--usually field\r\ngeologists.\r\n\r\nWe come to another important point in regard to river deposits. The\r\nceaseless flow of the river, and the abrading action of the large\r\nstones rolled along at the bottom of its channel, tend to cut the\r\nlatter deeper and deeper, and we have excellent evidence that most\r\nEnglish rivers once flowed at a greater elevation in their valleys\r\nthan they now do. In consequence of this, the brickmaker may find his\r\npit somewhat higher than the neighbouring river, which at an earlier\r\nstage of its existence made his brick-earths. To a certain extent,\r\nsmall earth movements, as previously explained, are also undoubtedly\r\nresponsible for many of these brick-earths now being at a considerable\r\nelevation above the surface of the river. This phenomenon is\r\nillustrated in Fig. 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Section across a river valley, showing\r\nformation of terraces of gravel and brick-earth.]\r\n\r\nThis type of disposition of fluviatile deposits is of common\r\noccurrence. We will assume that the valley is carved out of clay (shown\r\nby horizontal lines and dots). On both sides of it, and at the same\r\nrelative heights, are two masses (marked 1 and 2) of brick-earths and\r\ngravels running along so as to form two distinct broad terraces. These\r\nbeds were laid down when the river, in flood, though occupying only\r\na small portion of the valley, was approximately of the height shown\r\nby the dotted lines _a b_. Denudation has been hard at work, however,\r\nsince then, and only vestiges of these beds clinging to the sides of\r\nthe valley, as shown, remain. At a later period, and coming on towards\r\nmodern times, the broad expanse of beds (comparable in disposition\r\nwith those depicted in Fig. 2) some miles in width, marked 3, were laid\r\ndown, and we notice the river channel, as it now is, cutting its way\r\nthrough them. Thus it comes to pass that brickyards may be situated\r\nin terraces one above the other; and what is much more important, the\r\nbrick-earths may vary very widely in quality along these horizons,\r\nthose in 1 differing from 2 and both from 3. The brickyards may be\r\nquite close to each other, and to the unscientific eye the earths\r\nare of similar appearance, but they do not yield the same class of\r\nbrick, and no one seems to trouble to enquire the reason why. These\r\ndifferences have resulted primarily from the materials having been\r\nderived from other collecting grounds, other watersheds, than those\r\ncomprised within the basin of the river as at present constituted. They\r\nare the inevitable accompaniment of the evolution of the river system,\r\nand throw light on successive phases of the past history of the stream\r\nand its tributaries. For us, as we have seen, they possess considerable\r\npractical value of the first importance in selecting the site for a\r\nbrickyard.\r\n\r\nApart from differences of the character just described, serious\r\nalterations sometimes take place on these brick-earths being traced\r\nhigher up the valley, and indeed an excellent brickmaking material may\r\nbecome absolutely worthless in that respect, for the reasons about to\r\nbe explained. The reader will agree that neither stones nor sediment\r\ncan travel up a valley, and he will understand that no sediment can be\r\nfound in the valley earths other than that derived from the destruction\r\nof rocks within the watershed of the river system, to which the valleys\r\nbelong, or did belong, at the time the earths were formed. We desire to\r\nput the case in a very simple light, so as to be clearly comprehended.\r\nLet us contemplate Fig. 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Map shewing river basin, with geological\r\nformations depicted.]\r\n\r\nHere we have represented a river basin, the limits (watershed) of which\r\nare indicated by a sinuous dotted line. Three geological formations are\r\nfound therein; in the upper reaches of the main river is a series of\r\nclays marked A; a large tract in the middle, B, is sandstone; and the\r\nlower part, C, is occupied by limestone. Seeing that nothing but clay\r\ncrops out in the part A, it follows that the deposits of the river in\r\nthat region must be principally of an argillaceous character, to the\r\npoint _a_. On flowing over the sandstone B, the main stream, already\r\ncharged with clay particles, will be mixed with sand; the proportion\r\nof sand increases as the first large tributary (_b_) to the east is\r\nencountered, and is considerably augmented as the still more important\r\ntributary (_b_) to the west enters it. The superficial deposits in\r\nthe valleys of the area B will likewise be very sandy and perhaps\r\ngravelly at _b b_, but at _c c¹_ the sands and gravels will be mixed\r\nwith much clay. On passing over into the area C, much carbonate of\r\nlime is added, though the larger proportion denuded from the rocks is\r\ntaken away, chemically, in solution. Nevertheless, nodules of “race”\r\n(lime concretions), limestone pebbles, and perhaps chert and flint\r\ngravel will come upon the scene at about the point marked _e_. At _d_\r\nthe deposits would principally consist of gravel and impure marls. To\r\nsum up, the clays at _a_ would no doubt be too stiff of themselves to\r\nmake good bricks; similarly the beds at _b b_ would be nothing but\r\nsand, though these might be made, with a little judicious treatment,\r\ninto a species of fire-brick; at _c_ we should find alternating loams\r\nand clays suitable for turning out fair bricks; at _c¹_ the beds would\r\nbe more variable in character and more locally developed; they would\r\nconsist of thin beds of sand, clays, loams and gravels (principally\r\nsandstone fragments), which as a whole might be made serviceable,\r\nthough difficult to deal with; nothing of much use to us would come\r\nfrom point _d_, nor bordering the tributary running over C; there\r\nwould be too much lime present, though a trade might be started in\r\nbasic bricks should there be any demand for them in the neighbourhood;\r\nthis, however, would only pay under extremely favourable conditions.\r\nAt _e_ there may be a mixture of all the foregoing deposits, and\r\nproviding the beds above were easily weathered and thick beds of loam\r\nwere thus fairly well developed, good sites for brick-earth might be\r\nfound. The point _e_ might possess this advantage over the other sites\r\nmentioned, viz., that marls would no doubt be present, and thus no\r\nnecessity should arise for grinding lime to be incorporated with the\r\nbrick-earth; the only danger would be that lumps of limestone might be\r\ntoo numerous--especially if c were a hard limestone.\r\n\r\nThe general character of the deposits might be slightly modified by\r\nmineral matter brought up in springs and thrown down at convenient\r\nspots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLACUSTRINE AND FLUVIATILE BRICK-EARTHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great variability of brick-earths deposited in river valleys is\r\nreflected to some extent in those laid down in lakes, though the size\r\nof the latter is frequently a controlling factor. The chief difference\r\nconsists in the broader expanse of the sediment laid down--especially\r\nin large lakes--and variation in structure is not so noticeable\r\nhorizontally. Let us consider a simple case in which a lake is fed by a\r\nlarge river bringing down abundant sediment. The lake acts as a species\r\nof settling tank, and the method of deposition of the sediment by the\r\nriver is mainly guided by the velocity of the stream. The tendency\r\nunder normal conditions is for the river to commence parting with its\r\nsediment immediately on entering the lake. The detritus alluded to is\r\nonly held in suspension by the velocity of the water; when the latter\r\nis checked, as on entering the lake, the grosser pieces subside, and\r\nas its rapidity becomes progressively curbed, medium-sized fragments\r\nare compelled to give way, until at last only very minute particles are\r\nleft in the water. In due time most of these also are deposited. Thus\r\ngravel is laid down before grit, grit before sand, and sand before clay.\r\n\r\nIf the velocity of the river always remained the same, we should be\r\npresented with thick accumulations of the same character in sharply\r\ndefined areas. But it is always changing. With every storm and every\r\nsteady rain the motion of the river becomes greatly accelerated, with\r\nthe result that the deposits for the time being are deposited farther\r\nout in the lake than in more quiescent periods. In this way we may have\r\na gravel thrown down on sand, sand on clay, and so on.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing observations it will be gleaned that, in general,\r\ndeposits in large lakes are more persistent in character than are river\r\ndeposits; indeed, in very large sheets of water, as Lake Superior, Lake\r\nErie, &c., they are in this sense more comparable with sediment of\r\nmarine origin.\r\n\r\nThe practical value of this knowledge hinges on the correct\r\ndetermination of the origin of the deposits, and it is not always easy\r\nto identify a brick-earth of lacustrine origin. In all probability\r\nthe tyro, on meeting one, would be disposed to regard it as a river\r\ndeposit pure and simple. The valuation of a brick-earth property under\r\nsuch circumstances would thus be greatly in favour of the prospective\r\npurchaser; but it would be disastrous for the seller. A random section,\r\nexcept in the case of a very large lake, would show gravels, sands\r\nand clays in much the same manner as the river deposits described in\r\nthe last article of this series. But, as previously remarked, on the\r\nwhole they would be more continuous and persistent, and what is quite\r\nas important, the mineral composition of each stratum would be equally\r\nhomogeneous when traced over wide areas. The geologist distinguishes a\r\nlacustrine deposit from one of fluviatile origin more from its mineral\r\nconstitution and the general disposition of the beds, as ascertained by\r\nmapping, than from evidence afforded by fossils--these latter for the\r\nmost part being similar to those found in the deposits left by rivers.\r\n\r\nThe well-known brick-earth called “Reading mottled clay,” so\r\nextensively developed on the outskirts of the London basin, and in the\r\nIsle of Wight and Hampshire generally, furnishes a good example of a\r\nlacustrine deposit. Many millions of bricks are made from this bed\r\nevery year, and in some parts of the districts mentioned the stratum\r\nis thick and extensively developed. It is pure enough to be suitable\r\nfor terra-cotta manufacture here and there. No one who had seen this\r\nremarkable deposit could possibly fail to recognise it again. The\r\nnatural colour of the clay when damp is brilliant red, scarlet or\r\ncrimson, in large blotches and patches mottled tea-green and yellow,\r\nand locally white.\r\n\r\nWe have been intensely amused to note the efforts in recent years\r\nto obtain possession of a few acres of this coveted deposit for\r\nbrickmaking in divers localities. Not long since we visited a large\r\nbrickmaking establishment where these Reading plastic clays are\r\nactively raised and used, the works being situated four miles from the\r\nnearest railway. There were no other brickworks between it and the\r\nrailway line, and there was no water accommodation. Enquiry revealed\r\nthe fact that the greater part of the intervening land belonged to the\r\nsame landowner as the ground where the brickyard stands, and that no\r\ndifficulty was apprehended of the owner letting out such intervening\r\nland for the same uses and on the same terms if other brickyards were\r\ncontemplated. The proprietor of the brickyard in question volunteered\r\nthe information that the reason he started so far from the railway was\r\nbecause the earth at the point selected was the only kind suitable for\r\nbrickmaking in the neighbourhood. We then questioned him as to his\r\nknowledge of the brick-earths in the district, and eventually elicited\r\nthe fact that he chanced upon the spot selected, without any reasoning\r\ntherefor, and commenced operations. As a matter of fact, precisely the\r\nsame clay extended from his works all the way to the railway line, and\r\nhad he known anything whatever of the geology of the district (even\r\nthe merest boy’s knowledge of the subject), he would have seen how to\r\nsave that four miles of road carriage. What prevented him from knowing\r\nthe fact was a thin mantle of gravel and soil about four feet in\r\nthickness, which covered the plastic clay in the area generally, except\r\nin the immediate vicinity of his brickyard. That was in reference to a\r\nlacustrine deposit--the Reading plastic clay--and shows the value of\r\nknowing something of its persistent character; if it had been a river\r\ndeposit there would not have been so much room for wonderment.\r\n\r\nTo give some idea of the extent of that particular horizon, we may\r\nsay that not only is the plastic clay alluded to found so extensively\r\nin the London and Hampshire basins, it is even more expanded in the\r\nnorth-eastern parts of France, and is there as much utilised as on this\r\nside of the Channel for brickmaking.\r\n\r\nLacustrine deposits are sometimes of enormous value to the clayworker,\r\non account of the general purity of the clays. This is more\r\nparticularly the case when the material deposited is in part or wholly\r\nderived from chemical disintegration of granitic rocks, as in the\r\ncelebrated Bovey Heathfield clays near Newton Abbot, so well described\r\nin a small pamphlet by Mr. S. Smith Harvey. Here an experimental boring\r\nproved the clays to a depth of 130 feet with no signs of exhaustion.\r\nIn the divers clay-pits but a small proportion of waste is found,\r\nthe different levels vary in composition, and, like almost all thick\r\nclays, improve in quality as the depth increases. The strata are very\r\nirregular towards the surface, due perhaps to the action of local\r\nfreshets in the final periods of the history of the lake. These clays\r\nare extensively employed for the manufacture of stoneware pipes,\r\nfacing and other bricks, fire-bricks, etc. They constitute a somewhat\r\nremarkable exception to the class of clays laid down in lakes, as a\r\nrule, and, as will have been observed, are of enormous thickness.\r\n\r\nWe have very little to say in regard to estuarine brick-earths; as\r\nmight readily be anticipated, they are intermediate in character\r\nbetween fluviatile and marine deposits, and approach the one or\r\nthe other according to position in the estuary. On the whole, they\r\nare variable in character, individual beds being thin. The strata\r\nfrequently contain abundant plant remains (pieces of wood, etc.), and,\r\nexcept in the case of large rivers, are not noted for yielding very\r\ngood brick-earths. Sometimes, however, the quality of the clays is not\r\nbad, as instance the bricks made in Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire\r\nfrom Jurassic Estuarine clays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMARINE BRICK-EARTHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning to brick-earths of marine origin, we may say that these\r\nconstitute by far the largest class of deposits from which bricks are\r\nmade in this country, and it will be useful to deal with their origin\r\nin some detail. If we attentively watch the action of the weather on\r\na friable sea-cliff we notice that large pieces tumble at intervals\r\non to the beach, and in due time these are washed away by the waves,\r\nthus encouraging more to fall when the time is ripe. This process of\r\ndenudation each year takes tens of thousands of tons of sandy clays\r\nand the like from the beaches around our islands. Large pieces of\r\nrock, too, are detached by the weather, and eventually succumb to wave\r\naction. During storms large stones are hurled against the cliffs,\r\nand the general effect of this bombardment is to wear them away, and\r\nreduce them to powder and sand grains with all possible expedition.\r\nNo one who has not seen the waves at work at such times can have any\r\nidea of their tremendous power of moving blocks of stone many tons in\r\nweight. During calm weather the slight movement of the waves on the\r\nbeach is manufacturing tons and tons of sand. A mass of gravel falls\r\nfrom the cliff; the finer particles are floated away at the earliest\r\nopportunity; the angular stones have their rough projections knocked\r\noff by striking against each other; and the incessant movement up and\r\ndown the beach slope reduces the rough stone to a pebble, all the\r\ntime the particles thus shaved off are taken out to sea for greater\r\nor less distances. If the cliffs are of limestone, or similar rock,\r\nboth chemical and mechanical methods of denudation come into play, and\r\nconsiderable quantities of lime, &c., are taken away by the sea water\r\nin suspension and solution. Large quantities of lime are daily added to\r\nthe sea through the agency of rivers also.\r\n\r\nNow, what becomes of these vast quantities of detritus furnished to the\r\nsea? That depends on the shore currents at the particular locality. If\r\nthere is not much of a current, the larger grains of grit and sand are\r\nsoon separated from the rest, and fall to the bottom, whilst the clays\r\nare taken farther out to sea before being laid down. But, in any case,\r\nthe reader will readily perceive that marine deposits must of necessity\r\nbe on a grander scale, and of a much more substantial character, as a\r\nrule, than river, lacustrine, or estuarine deposits. By their mode of\r\norigin, too, they must be more homogeneous, whilst they are frequently\r\nseveral hundreds of feet in thickness. In their process of deposition\r\nthey were not influenced by every storm and freshet; nothing short\r\nof great earth-movements in process of time, or some other equally\r\ngrand phenomena, could disturb the even tenour of their existence. How\r\ndifferent to the comparatively insignificant strata formed by the other\r\nmethods alluded to!\r\n\r\nTake samples of brick-earth of fluviatile origin at intervals and\r\nanalyse them; no two analyses will be alike, except by a most\r\nremarkable coincidence--more by accident than otherwise. On the other\r\nhand, take a thick marine clay, and compare its chemical composition\r\nas ascertained at the present time with that of it made, say, 20 years\r\nago in the same brickyard, and the analyses will, in most instances, be\r\npractically identical--at any rate, so far as they may be of use to the\r\nbrickmaker.\r\n\r\nA brickmaker using a marine clay possesses innumerable advantages over\r\nanother employing brick-earths due to river action. It is no uncommon\r\nthing for a marine clay--say, 300 feet in thickness--to continue\r\nacross country for hundreds of miles, stretching from the North of\r\nEngland to the South, and over into the Continent, save for the slight\r\nbreak occasioned by the scooping out of the English Channel. The\r\ncomposition of the Oxford Clay, from which the well-known bricks at\r\nPeterborough are made, does not differ in the slightest degree, so far\r\nas suitability for brickmaking is concerned, from the Oxford Clay of\r\nBourges or Chateauroux, in the centre of France, or indeed at almost\r\nany other point _en route_. With marine beds it is possible to deal\r\nwith the matter on broad lines, but it is not so with any other class\r\nof deposits.\r\n\r\nIf a marine clay in a specified locality is found to be unsuitable for\r\nbricks at one point, by reason of the presence of too much lime, it\r\nwould be a phenomenon if clay along the same geological horizon did\r\nnot present the same unfavourable features at every other point within\r\nthe district. The homogeneous composition, both from mineralogical and\r\nchemical standpoints, of thick marine clays renders them of special use\r\nto the brickmaker. Having by sundry processes, after infinite labour,\r\nproduced a certain class of brick from such an earth, he does not as a\r\nrule have to materially modify those processes as the earth is dug into\r\nto continue manufacturing the same brick. He is dealing with an earth\r\nwhich, comparatively speaking, is a constant quantity--when the clays\r\nare thick, and no lines of bedding are distinctly visible.\r\n\r\nWe find that a rooted conviction exists in many brickyards that clays\r\nof marine origin are no good for brickmaking, because (so the opinion\r\nruns) they always contain so much salt. It is wonderful that such\r\nignorance prevails, when the slightest acquaintance with the subject\r\nwould teach otherwise. It is perfectly true that such deposits might\r\nhave contained salt during and for some time after deposition, but\r\nit is absurd to suppose that their marine origin has anything to do\r\nwith the presence of common salt in the clay at the present time.\r\nSalt is soluble in water, and has been removed from such clays by the\r\npercolation of underground water in 99 cases out of a hundred. Indeed,\r\nas a matter of experience, we find that salt is most commonly found in\r\nbeds of lacustrine origin, or those laid down in enclosed portions of\r\nthe sea, for reasons we need not enter into at the present moment. Of\r\ncourse, when material is taken from the sea-shore to make into bricks,\r\na considerable quantity of salt is manifest, but that is a totally\r\ndifferent thing to the clays deposited--we should not like to say\r\nhow many thousands of years ago. Clays of all kinds, however, may be\r\nimpregnated with salt (as in parts of Cheshire), owing to the proximity\r\nof other beds containing that mineral; also by the percolation of\r\nunderground water with much salt in solution.\r\n\r\nTo give some idea of the antiquity of the Oxford Clay alluded to--and\r\nthat is quite a “young clay” geologically speaking--we may remark\r\nthat at the time it was laid down not a single species of animal\r\nexisted like those now living. The only mammals found, very small and\r\nvery lowly organised, were like kangaroo rats; the birds were more\r\nlike flying reptiles than anything else; it was the age of reptiles,\r\nand enormous, unwieldy brutes swam in the water or floundered about\r\non land; huge sharks abounded, and armour-clad fish of kinds very\r\ndifferent to those now existing roamed the sea; even the “shell-fish”\r\nwere not altogether like modern ones; whilst the plants find their\r\nnearest modern analogues in the wilds of Australasia. No elephants,\r\ntigers, lions, bears, or dogs lived then, and the face of Nature wore\r\na totally different aspect to what obtains at the present time in any\r\npart of the globe.\r\n\r\nAnd this seems a fitting opportunity to the writer to put on record\r\nthe fact that many of the most wonderful remains found in the Oxford\r\nClay and the neighbouring Kimeridge Clay are due to the discoveries\r\nof brickmakers. Without their valuable aid scientists would be quite\r\nunable to clearly depict the life of those remote epochs. We have\r\nmentioned Peterborough; some most interesting remains have been found\r\nin the clays near that town during the past few years. To appreciate\r\nthis let the reader visit the fossil reptile gallery of the British\r\nMuseum (Natural History), at South Kensington. One of the most recent\r\nacquisitions, set up a year or two ago, is the skeleton of a young\r\n_Plesiosaurus_--without doubt the most perfect specimen in the world of\r\nits kind--from Peterborough. The _Plesiosaurus_ was a large swimming\r\nreptile, with paddles, and a long neck.\r\n\r\nWe mention these things not only to instil philosophical interest in\r\nsuch brick-earths, which may be reflected upon after business hours,\r\nbut to impart some idea of the extreme remoteness of the epoch from the\r\nhuman point of view, and to insist on the immensity of the intervening\r\ntime throughout which circulating underground waters--even in such an\r\nimpervious material as stiff clay--may have exerted chemical action.\r\nThe “mineralisation” of the fossils is an eloquent witness of the\r\neffect of such changes. The reader will perceive from this that there\r\nis scant possibility of soluble salts being present in such marine\r\nclays; and the geological circumstances are fully borne out by the\r\nresults of hundreds of chemical analyses of thick marine clays.\r\n\r\nThe invertebrate fossils more particularly testify to the marine\r\norigin of the clays, and are thus invested with considerable practical\r\ninterest. The man whose duty it is to determine the persistence, or\r\notherwise, of valuable marine brick-earths has thus a much easier task\r\nthan when called upon to decide the value of a large tract of land for\r\nbrickmaking purposes, of fluviatile origin. Finally, brick-earths do\r\nnot, except in extremely rare instances, vary materially in character\r\nwhen dug into horizontally, thus every opportunity is afforded to\r\nthe manufacturer for making an unvariable quality brick, tile, or\r\ndrain pipe. It should be borne in mind, however, that these clays\r\noften weather a brown colour, which on being dug into changes to a\r\nbluish-black tint, the latter being the unaltered and best portion as\r\na rule. The only practical advantage the worker of a superficial river\r\ndeposit possesses over his neighbour using thick marine clay is in the\r\ngreat range of variation in materials disclosed in the former kind of\r\npit. By judiciously mixing the different beds he may be able to live\r\nwell where the worker of marine clays, especially where the clay is\r\ntoo stiff, or contains too much lime, “comes to grief.” A good marine\r\nclay is a great boon, a bad one cannot be remedied other than by the\r\nsacrifice of much money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINERAL CONSTITUTION OF BRICK-EARTHS.\r\n\r\nThere cannot be any question that the applicability or otherwise, of\r\nan earth for making good bricks, to a large extent depends on the\r\nmineral constitution of that earth. A chemical analysis of a sample\r\nof such earth will tell us how much silica, alumina, lime, iron,\r\netc., is present therein, and this information is frequently of great\r\nvalue when given by a scientific chemist; but it does not tell us the\r\nstate in which those constituents exist in the earth--an essential\r\n_desideratum_, if we are to understand the scientific aspects of the\r\nquestion of burning in the kiln. Further, the size of the granules\r\nand particles composing the earth is well worth knowing, as we shall\r\npresently see. It is a great mistake to imagine that all clays are\r\nessentially chemical deposits. The majority of them have been in part\r\nderived from chemical disintegration, it is true; but the resulting\r\ndeposits contain so much also that is purely of mechanical origin, that\r\nthe behaviour of the whole is materially modified, from a metallurgical\r\npoint of view. Take one ingredient, for example--say, silica. That\r\nmay exist in a brick-earth in a variety of ways, both in a free and\r\ncombined state; but its behaviour in the kiln is largely dependent on\r\nthe particular form assumed, not only whether it is free or combined,\r\nbut as to how it is combined. In a certain sense, it is very doubtful\r\nwhether even in the best-burnt brick much of the raw material becomes\r\nchemically combined; a sort of agglutination takes place locally, as is\r\nclearly shown by the microscope; at such points true fusion undoubtedly\r\ntakes place, and there may be actual chemical combination. In the vast\r\nmajority of cases, however, such fusion or possible combination is of\r\nan extremely partial and elementary character, whilst it hardly exists\r\nin the average “rubber.” The microscope shows that even in the hardest\r\nburnt brick there still remain enormous quantities of what may be\r\ntermed mineral grains, that have by no means succumbed to the burning\r\nprocess. The edges of the grains may occasionally be seen merging into\r\nthe more or less vitreous ground mass in which they are embedded, but\r\nbeyond that they appear tolerably fresh, and their action on polarised\r\nlight remains unimpaired.\r\n\r\nWe did not intend to say anything yet concerning the microscopic\r\nstructure of bricks--that will be gone into in a subsequent chapter;\r\nbut we thought it useful to state the foregoing elementary facts in\r\norder to endeavour to uproot a conviction that seems to be very firmly\r\ngrounded--viz., that the chemical composition of a brick-earth imparts\r\nan accurate idea of the possible active agents, on the earth being\r\nsubjected to the kiln. As a matter of fact, some of these would-be\r\nagents are imprisoned in the mineral grains and particles that have not\r\nbecome involved in the partial melting or agglutination of the mass,\r\nand might as well not be present in the earth for any work they may\r\naccomplish either for good or for evil. There is greater probability\r\nof the bulk of these grains and particles being of active service\r\nwhen they are ground up exceedingly fine; but the clayworker’s idea\r\nof “fineness,” as demonstrated by what passes through an ordinary\r\nclayworking mill, and “fineness” in the sense here intended, are two\r\ntotally different things. We mean something that shall render the\r\nparticles so small as that they shall only be observable on being\r\nmagnified, say, 50 diameters. Hardly any clays used in brickmaking\r\nare in bulk made of such small particles as this; there are a few, of\r\nwhich the best terra-cotta and porcelain are manufactured, however,\r\nbut even these have to be very carefully prepared to exclude grosser\r\nforeign particles. From what we have said, it will be gathered that\r\nthe terra-cotta and porcelain manufacturer is at the present time in a\r\nbetter position to judge of the work done in the kiln or oven than is\r\nthe brickmaker. But that is simply a matter of education; the problems\r\npresented to the average brickmaker are rather more complicated than to\r\nthe terra-cotta manufacturer, but they may be unravelled on sufficient\r\napplication, as we hope to point out.\r\n\r\nEven under the most favourable conditions, however--when the particles\r\ncomposing the mass require a ¼-inch objective for their elucidation--we\r\nfind that the best burnt brick is largely made up of them in an\r\nunmelted condition. And we should be very sorry to get rid of them; for\r\nif they disappeared, the stony attributes of the brick would disappear\r\nalso, and the general value of the substance would be deteriorated to\r\nsuch an extent that it would be unsaleable as a building material.\r\nThe brick would nearest resemble a form of slag. All we now insist\r\nupon is that in brickmaking a chemical analysis is only useful up to\r\na certain point, beyond which we must appeal to the microscope to aid\r\nus, and this in conjunction with as perfect a knowledge as possible as\r\nto the behaviour of earths of certain mineral composition when under\r\nthe influence of high temperatures. In many instances, the value of the\r\nbrick depends almost entirely on incapacity for fusion on the part of a\r\nlarge proportion of the minerals of which the brick is made. Possibly,\r\na good all-round brick would be where the bulk of its mineral particles\r\nwere infusible at the temperature employed, and when the remainder\r\nwere fusible enough to partially run, so as to cement or agglutinate\r\nthe infusible particles firmly together. In order to bring about such\r\nconditions artificially, or to arrive at them even approximately, we\r\nmust know at least three things, viz.--(1) the nature of the mineral\r\nparticles involved in the whole operation; (2) their behaviour\r\nunder high temperatures; and (3) a knowledge of certain branches of\r\nmetallurgical chemistry. Now, obviously, we cannot undertake to teach\r\neven the spirit of what is involved in these three _desiderata_ in a\r\nsmall book like this; but we can, and shall, attempt to do something\r\nin that direction, and we must ask the reader’s indulgence to take\r\nfor granted observations to be occasionally made, in the inevitable\r\nprospect of our not being able to explain them at sufficient length.\r\n\r\nThe following are the principal minerals found in clays used in\r\nbrickmaking, together with their more important attributes from our\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\n\r\nKAOLIN.\r\n\r\nPure clay is, theoretically, composed of this mineral alone, but pure\r\nclay does not exist in Nature, except as a mineralogical curiosity.\r\nWhat is generally called pure clay is a white, or light-grey plastic\r\nmaterial, composed of kaolin with many other substances to a small\r\ndegree, from which it frequently has to, as far as possible,\r\nbe separated before being put to its highest uses in porcelain\r\nmanufacture. Chemically, pure kaolin may be regarded as a hydrous\r\nsilicate of alumina, viz.--silica = 46.3, alumina = 39.8, and water\r\n= 13.9. Under the microscope, in reflected light, it is seen to be\r\nmade up of extremely minute, thin, six-sided plates, which are said\r\n(doubtfully) to crystallize in the rhombic system; though, when\r\nregarded with the naked eye, one would not suppose that it possessed\r\na crystalline structure, as it appears to be an earthy, unctuous\r\nsubstance. It is commonly mixed with grains and small crystals and\r\nfragments of quartz, which mineral will presently be described. Being\r\nderived from the decomposition of felspars, the microscope reveals\r\nthe fact that in addition to the six-sided plates alluded to, a great\r\ndeal of opaque matter, as particles of mud, occurs in the substance\r\nuniversally known as kaolin. It is very difficult to satisfactorily\r\nstate what this mud is; micro-chemically, its general character may\r\nbe brought out. There is no doubt, however, that in converting the\r\nkaolin into china-ware, these particles are more active than the\r\nminute kaolin crystals in uniting with other substances to form a\r\nspecies of flux. The subject has been investigated to a very limited\r\nextent, but from the foregoing observations it will be seen that the\r\nproportion of amorphous mud particles to the minute crystals must be\r\nan important factor in determining the nature of the fluxing material,\r\nand of the quantity of this latter to be used. Correlatively, the\r\nfusing point can be determined in the same manner. For, in itself,\r\nkaolin is an infusible mineral, and before it can be made use of for\r\nbrickmaking, terra-cotta, or any kindred purpose, it must be rendered\r\nartificially fusible by the addition of a fluxing substance. When,\r\ntherefore, we learn that kaolin is being used for these purposes, we\r\nknow, if used direct as it comes from the pit, that it must be impure\r\nfrom a mineralogical standpoint, or that it is being mixed with other\r\nsubstances. We say that kaolin is infusible (refractory); we mean at\r\nany temperature used in the industrial arts, including brickmaking.\r\nWith the recent improvements in the electric furnace, the temperature\r\ngenerated is so high that practically any mineral substance may be\r\nmelted; it is hard to speak of anything being infusible.\r\n\r\nBut the mineral matter called kaolin in ordinary clays, such as the\r\nbrown and blue London Clay, the Oxford Clay, “brick-earths,” etc.,\r\nhas very little in common with the more or less pure china-clay. The\r\nmicroscope shows that in the vast majority of such clays scales of true\r\nkaolin are few and far between, that opaque mud particles are more\r\nfrequent, and, above all, that pieces of highly decomposed felspar\r\n(called “kaolinised” matter) are present. Eliminating all other and\r\nforeign substances from the clay, the whole of what would commonly be\r\ncalled kaolin and kaolinised matter, taken together, is of very varied\r\nchemical composition, and might, indeed, be fusible in the ordinary\r\nsense of that term. From this, the reader will perceive that the term\r\nkaolin is very ambiguous and altogether too wide in its meaning. We\r\nthink it highly desirable, therefore, to describe kaolin as a true\r\nmineral and not as a rock, reserving the term for the crystalline\r\nplates. The mud particles referred to we may call “kaolinised\r\nparticles;” and the highly decomposed felspar “kaolinised matter.” To\r\nsum up the relative fusibility of these substances, _per se_, we should\r\nsay that (1) kaolin crystals are practically infusible; (2) kaolinised\r\nparticles are either fusible, partly fusible, or infusible, depending\r\non the actual nature of the particles; and (3) that kaolinised matter\r\nmay be difficultly fusible or infusible. A mixture of (1) and (2) may\r\nnot be fusible, and could not be unless a great proportion of (2) of a\r\nfusible character, so as to form a flux, were present. The reasons for\r\nthis will appear in considering the different kinds of felspar, next to\r\nbe described.\r\n\r\n\r\nFELSPAR.\r\n\r\nThis mineral, a very common constituent of nearly all clays and\r\nbrick-earths is very variable in character, but may be separated into a\r\nnumber of mineral species, each of which possesses a definite structure\r\nand a more or less constant chemical composition. To show the range\r\nof variation, the following kinds of felspar, with their chemical\r\ncomposition, may be quoted:--[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chemical Composition of Felspars._\r\n\r\n  -------------+---------+----------+---------+-------+-------\r\n               | Silica. | Alumina. | Potash. | Soda. | Lime.\r\n               +---------+----------+---------+-------+-------\r\n  Orthoclase   |  64.6   |  18.5    |  16.9   |       |\r\n  Albite       |  68.6   |  19.5    |         | 11.8  |\r\n  Oligoclase   |  63.7   |  23.9    |   1.20  |  8.1  |  2.0\r\n  Labradorite  |  52.9   |  30.3    |         |  4.5  | 12.3\r\n  Anorthite    |  43.0   |  36.8    |         |       | 20.1\r\n  -------------+---------+----------+---------+-------+-------\r\n\r\nOrthoclase felspar, in addition to the above, frequently has small\r\nproportions of lime, iron, magnesia and soda. Amongst other things it\r\nis an essential constituent of granite, and on the decomposition of\r\nthat rock is the first mineral to become affected. When attacked in\r\nthe open air by rain and the ordinary agents of denudation, granite\r\nultimately gives way by the dissolution of the felspar, and on being\r\nremoved, the felspathic matter may accumulate in convenient situations\r\nto form kaolin. If we now compare the chemical constitution of\r\northoclase felspar with that of kaolin as previously given, we notice\r\nthat the potash has disappeared in the decomposing process; it has\r\nbeen dissolved and taken away by rivulets, and the like, or washed\r\nby rain direct into the sea. We also observe that there has been a\r\nre-distribution, so to speak, of the relative proportions of silica and\r\nalumina--following well-known laws.\r\n\r\nOf the remaining felspars the commonest for our purposes is oligoclase,\r\na mineral found in nearly all British “granites” in a greater or less\r\ndegree. That contains a higher percentage of alumina than orthoclase,\r\nand there is a fair proportion of soda and little lime, but much\r\nless potash. The lime-soda felspar, labradorite, and its near ally,\r\nanorthite, are not often met with in a recognisable form in clays.\r\nIf present, they are generally as “kaolinised matter,” too highly\r\ndecomposed to exhibit their characteristic optical properties.\r\n\r\nIt is pretty generally stated, and too often assumed by some, that pure\r\nchina-clay is derived from the direct decomposition of rocks containing\r\n“orthoclase” felspar. Yet, this cannot really be so, if we reflect on\r\nthe mineral composition of many of the rocks, which, obviously, have\r\nyielded the china-clays in question. Take the china-clays of Devon and\r\nCornwall; they have undoubtedly been derived from the “granites” of\r\nthose counties. To some extent, as previously remarked, the orthoclase\r\nis attacked, and provides the material of which china-clay is made. But\r\nin the “West of England,” we have yet to learn that some of the other\r\nfelspars are not also involved in the process. If we examine a fresh\r\npiece of granite from the flanks of Dartmoor, or from the neighbourhood\r\nof Liskeard, or St. Austell, we find no difficulty in recognising a\r\nfair proportion of triclinic felspar (one or more of those mentioned\r\nin the table except orthoclase) in it. There is a difference in\r\nthe composition (and therefore the commercial applicability) of a\r\nchina-clay derived from a rock containing orthoclase alone, and one\r\nfrom a rock having orthoclase and one or more triclinic felspars\r\nin addition. The latter minerals are more easily decomposed than\r\northoclase, especially the lime and lime-soda varieties. We should\r\nnot have raised this point only that, by reason of the granites\r\nbeing to some extent mechanically as well as chemically decomposed,\r\na large proportion of “kaolinised particles” and “kaolinised matter”\r\nis introduced into certain china-clays, which render them different\r\nin their behaviour under intense heat from those china-clays in which\r\northoclase alone has been principally concerned. In other words,\r\ngreat practical advantages accrue from an accurate knowledge of the\r\nconstitution and origin of the china-clays in question. Two clays of\r\nthe same chemical composition often behave in a different manner in the\r\nkiln; the cause of this is frequently to be found in the prevalence of\r\n“mechanical fragments” of felspar in one of the clays; and the absence\r\nof these, but the presence of “kaolinised particles” of the same\r\nchemical composition, in the other.\r\n\r\nAnother point to which we may draw attention is the erroneous\r\nsupposition that granites which have yielded china-clay have in all\r\ninstances been reduced to the condition in which we now find them by\r\nthe action of atmospheric agents of denudation alone. Granites, as a\r\nmatter of fact, yield very slowly to the action of the atmosphere,\r\nand taken as a whole no building stone is as durable as they. How\r\ncomes it, then, that they have decomposed to such an extent as to\r\nhave formed extensive deposits of china-clay in a very short space of\r\ntime, geologically? We think the answer is to be sought, at any rate\r\nin some instances, in the alteration the rock as a whole has undergone\r\nin certain situations, whereby it became more easily decomposable.\r\nTake the rotten china-stone of the neighbourhood of St. Austell, for\r\nexample. In that material we clearly see a stone from which the “life”\r\nhas been sapped, and instead of a bright, sparkling, porphyritic\r\ngranite, as it once was, we now notice only a ghost of its former self.\r\nThe large orthoclase felspars may be seen in it as skeletons, the\r\nmica is reduced to mere iron-stains (when present at all), whilst the\r\nquartz is also slightly affected. This altered and comparatively rotten\r\nmaterial (although sometimes hard enough to be used as building stone)\r\nextends to an enormous depth from the surface; it has not been bottomed\r\nin some parts of the district. Such an extensive transformation could\r\nnot possibly be due to ordinary agents of denudation which do their\r\nwork at and near the surface of the rock only. It seems to arise from\r\nan enormous regional alteration, acting underground to an unfathomable\r\ndepth, and which may not be unconnected with the mineral veins so\r\ncommon in, and in the immediate vicinity of the workings.[4]\r\n\r\nYet another thing to be remembered is that, under certain conditions,\r\nas near St. Austell, china-clay has been formed _in situ_, and has\r\ntherefore not been deposited by the action of running water, as have\r\nthe majority of china and other clays. Mr. Collins remarks that this\r\nchina-clay is very irregular in its occurrence. It seems to be formed\r\nof various granite masses decomposed in place; it often occupies\r\nconsiderable surface areas, and extends to a depth unknown. He remarks\r\nthat at Beam mine, and also at Rocks mine, both near St. Austell,\r\nchina-clay was found to a depth considerably exceeding 60 fathoms from\r\nthe surface. This china-clay, in its natural condition, is very much\r\nthe same as china-stone; but the decomposition has proceeded further,\r\nthe felspar being completely changed into clay; and nothing more is\r\nnecessary for extracting the clay than the disintegration of the whole\r\nmass by a stream of water directed upon it, when the clay is carried\r\naway in suspension and collected at convenient spots. Thus there is\r\nevery gradation between the true crystalline orthoclase and triclinic\r\nfelspars, through china-stone into china-clay formed _in situ_, so\r\ninto china-clay deposited from water by natural or artificial means,\r\nand into a pure clay containing a large proportion of kaolin crystals,\r\n“kaolinised particles” and “kaolinised matter.” But although we can\r\nstate that much, a great deal yet remains to be done in connecting\r\nmineral structure with chemical composition of the purer clays, and\r\nin defining the various grades scientifically, in order that full\r\nadvantage may be derived from them in a commercial sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMINERALS: THEIR BEHAVIOUR IN THE KILN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SILICA GROUP.\r\n\r\nSilica, the oxide of silicon, is found in brickmaking clays principally\r\nin two conditions when not combined with other substances: in one of\r\nthese the free silica may be crystalline, when it is known as _quartz_;\r\nin the other it may be hard, but not crystalline, as _flint_. We may\r\nconsider these in order.\r\n\r\nQUARTZ.--When pure this mineral is perfectly white and transparent,\r\nlike ordinary window glass. It is exceedingly hard, and this property\r\nis of much service as enabling us by the most elementary examination\r\nto distinguish it from certain other minerals, which it is not unlike\r\nat first sight. One of the latter is calcite, a crystalline form of\r\ncarbonate of lime, also white and transparent. Quartz and calcite\r\nbehave in a very different manner in the kiln, and as we shall see,\r\nthey are both rather common constituents of brick-earth. The difference\r\nin hardness may easily be ascertained by the point of a good steel\r\nknife; the steel will not scratch the quartz, but it will, easily, the\r\ncalcite.\r\n\r\nWhen it has plenty of room wherein to crystallise, and is not hemmed\r\nin, as it were, by other hard crystalline matter, quartz often forms\r\nbeautiful six-sided prisms surmounted by a six-sided pyramid, and,\r\nrarely, pyramids are found at both ends of a prism. There are no\r\nlines, or “planes of cleavage,” to interfere with the transparency,\r\neither in the extremely minute forms of the mineral as investigated\r\nby the microscope, or in the gigantic crystals occasionally found.\r\nRegular crystals of quartz, although by no means rare in Nature, are\r\nseldom met with entire in brick-earths. The most common form of the\r\nmineral is in irregular aggregates with other minerals, as in the rock\r\ngranite, which is composed essentially, as previously mentioned, of\r\nquartz, felspar, and mica. We have traced the history of the felspar\r\non the decomposition of that rock, and it may now be said that on\r\ncomplete disintegration of the granite a great part of the quartz\r\npresent is simply resolved into fragments and dealt with by rain and\r\nother transporting agents. For quartz is practically imperishable; it\r\nis almost proof against the deleterious acids in the atmosphere, which\r\nso readily attack many other common minerals. In dealing with it, all\r\nNature can do (at least at the surface of the earth) is to carry the\r\nsmall quartz grains and pieces about from place to place; She can,\r\nand does, in this process, reduce the quartzose fragments by causing\r\nthem to continually knock against each other and against other mineral\r\nfragments and masses until the grains and pieces find a resting place;\r\nShe may put them in a mill and grind them to powder, but the quartz is\r\nstill there.\r\n\r\nAnother manner in which quartz occurs in Nature is as filling cracks\r\nin rocks, but this is comparatively unimportant for our present\r\npurposes. The purest quartz is known as rock crystal; but by far the\r\ncommonest kinds of the mineral are impure; they may contain iron,\r\nschorl (a black needle-like crystal), and many other minerals. One of\r\nthe most interesting points about it, and which undoubtedly in certain\r\ncases is of importance to the brick manufacturer as modifying its\r\nmelting properties, is the presence of myriads of extremely minute\r\nso-called cavities, generally filled (or nearly filled) by liquids\r\nof different kinds, the precise nature of which is not as well-known\r\nas it might be, though in some instances it has been determined with\r\ntolerable certainty. In some cases these inclusions are so numerous as\r\nto obliterate the transparency of the quartz crystal, causing it to\r\npresent a frosted appearance. The fluids in these cavities may have\r\nbeautiful little crystals of other minerals, such as salt, floating\r\nabout--but it must be remembered that we are referring to something\r\ninfinitely little. These slight differences in the constitution of\r\nminerals, however, have their influence in the kiln. For instance,\r\nalthough the fluid present is usually water, that often contains carbon\r\ndioxide, which acts as a species of flux to the quartz when present in\r\nsufficient quantity.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the second form of silica present in brick-earths,\r\nflint, that is of precisely the same chemical composition as quartz,\r\nonly that it is not crystalline, nor transparent, though thin pieces\r\nof flint are translucent. Flint is by no means as common in Nature\r\nas quartz; it is very hard, but brittle, and breaks with what is\r\ntermed a conchoidal fracture, from the fact that the fractured surface\r\nfrequently resembles the external appearance of the shell of a bivalve\r\nmollusc. It occurs in a variety of ways; (1) often as hard lumps or\r\nnodules running along in fairly regular layers in limestone rocks such\r\nas chalk, and (2) occasionally filling up cracks or joints in such\r\nrocks. It is hard to describe its origin in a few words, and we shall\r\nnot attempt it; all that need be noted is that it is frequently full of\r\nthe remains of extinct organisms of small size, which may, or may not,\r\nconstitute an impurity depending on the particular organism and its\r\npresent condition. When flint contains a fair proportion of iron it is\r\ncalled chert--an extremely common constituent of brick-earths in some\r\nlocalities--though that term refers to other rocks, such for instance,\r\nas those made up almost exclusively of the siliceous spicules (hard\r\nparts made of silica) of fossil sponges.\r\n\r\nA more or less crystalline kind of silica is found, forming the\r\nskeletons of minute aquatic plants, and these accumulating to some\r\ndepth, constitute the basis of such materials as Kieselguhr and the\r\ndiatom earth of the Isle of Skye, both of which, especially the former,\r\nare used for making firebricks.\r\n\r\nThere is very little to be said concerning the behaviour of free\r\nsilica--quartz and flint--in the kiln. It is infusible except at\r\nhigher temperatures than are employed by the brickmaker. But, as we\r\nhave already remarked, the impurities often present in the minerals\r\nform a species of flux which naturally brings them into the range\r\nof fusible substances, though even then the temperature required is\r\nfar beyond what is usually attained in the majority of brickyards,\r\nthough it might be frequently arrived at in the manufacture of certain\r\nfire-bricks. For all ordinary purposes, therefore, quartz and flint may\r\nbe regarded as infusible. In presence of much lime, iron, or similar\r\nsubstances, however, both of them are readily melted, and it is part of\r\nthe science of brickmaking to know exactly how much lime, &c., to add\r\nto yield the best results. Many brick-earths contain large quantities\r\nof the calcareous and ferruginous substances alluded to, and are then\r\ncapable of being made into bricks direct, without any addition. But\r\nalthough such natural brickmaking earths are frequently employed by the\r\nmanufacturer, nearly all of them could be made to yield a better brick\r\nby a little artificial mixing. We must keep urging this point; there is\r\nroom for great improvement all round.\r\n\r\nAs with the majority of comparatively refractory substances, the\r\nsize of the grains and pieces of quartz and flint makes a difference\r\nin their readiness to become fusible. The larger the grain the more\r\ndifficult it is to break down; fusion commences at the outside of a\r\nquartz grain, the centre of which may at the same time be comparatively\r\nunaffected. By arresting the fusing process, the microscope shows the\r\noutside of the grain to have become softened (so much so as to affect\r\nits doubly refracting properties), whilst the innermost parts still\r\nretain their usual optical characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nMICA.\r\n\r\nThe different varieties of mica are important as rock-forming minerals,\r\nbut they are not as often met with in brick-earths as is generally\r\nsupposed, except in insignificant quantity. Some of the purest clays,\r\nhowever, contain a great deal of mica, derived almost directly from the\r\ndestruction of granite. The two commonest varieties of the mineral are\r\n_biotite_ and _muscovite_.\r\n\r\nBIOTITE MICA.--This mineral, usually known as ferro-magnesian mica,\r\nis composed of silicates of magnesia, alumina, iron, and alkalies\r\nin variable proportions. It occurs as six-sided plates or irregular\r\nscales, usually of a bronze-black colour. Biotite weathers with\r\ncomparative facility, hence the reason why it is not more commonly met\r\nwith in brown and other impure clays.\r\n\r\nMUSCOVITE MICA.--This is sometimes called potash- or alumino-alkaline\r\nmica, composed of the silicates of alumina, alkalies, iron, and\r\nmagnesia; the proportion of silica ranges from 45 to 50 per cent. It\r\nmay usually be distinguished at sight from biotite by its silvery white\r\nor light brown colour. When large enough, both the micas mentioned\r\nmay be split up into thin plates, muscovite yielding large transparent\r\nsheets. Compared with all other constituents of brick-earth, the micas\r\nare bright and of semi-metallic lustre. Muscovite is more durable\r\nthan biotite, and is much more frequently met with in brick-earths,\r\nespecially in the sandy varieties.\r\n\r\nThe influence of mica in the kiln is not of much importance in ordinary\r\nbrickmaking; in general its alkaline character renders it fusible,\r\nthough a high temperature is necessary at all times to effect that.\r\nIn china-clay mica is regarded as a nuisance, and in breaking down\r\nthe material it is separated in the washing process by running water,\r\nthe mineral collecting in depressions or basins, called “micas.” When\r\nmuscovite contains much fluorine, as it frequently does, it is very\r\nundesirable in clays for high-class purposes. At the best of times the\r\nproportion of iron in mica is sufficient to mar the quality of the\r\notherwise most excellent clays. In the kiln, or porcelain furnace, the\r\npresence of mica (more particularly biotite) is apt to create yellow\r\nand brown specks, or a species of mottling. It is highly satisfactory,\r\ntherefore, to note that these little shiny flakes may be easily floated\r\noff by a moderate amount of care in washing, and thus separated from\r\nthe other constituents of the clay.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRON.\r\n\r\nExcept in regard to white kaolin clays, nearly all earths used in\r\nbrickmaking contain more or less iron, which is usually present as\r\nprotoxide in many mineral constituents. The colouring matter of clays\r\nis generally iron in some form, and blue clays weather into brown by\r\nthe alteration of that mineral. It is unnecessary for us to consider\r\nthe various minerals of the iron group; all we need do is to state the\r\nmode of occurrence of iron oxides in clays and earths, to consider a\r\nvariety known as iron-pyrite, and the general effects of ferruginous\r\nminerals in the kiln.\r\n\r\nIron may occur in clays simply as a stain, when it is usually not in\r\nlarge quantity, or it may occur combined with some mineral or minerals\r\npresent--as for instance certain felspars and micas. The brown, yellow,\r\nor blue appearance of the clay is due to it. In loam it may be found\r\nalso as a species of ochreous earth, and in thin bedded loams (as the\r\nupper part of the Woolwich and Reading series of the London basin)\r\neach layer frequently varies in the proportion of iron present. In the\r\nmore arenaceous parts of these loamy deposits, little grains of iron\r\nsometimes make their appearance, as also in certain sands employed in\r\nbrickmaking; on careful examination, however, many of these grains are\r\nfound to be other mineral substances coated with iron. Certain horizons\r\nin what are known as the Jurassic rocks contain great quantities of\r\nferruginous matter in little pellets.\r\n\r\nIron, in large proportion, acts as a flux to other constituents when\r\nthe brick-earth is subjected to great heat in the kiln, and on that\r\naccount must be carefully watched. But, to the average brickmaker,\r\nthe ferruginous constituent is far more interesting as a colouring\r\nmedium. At a later stage we shall have something to say concerning the\r\ncolouring of bricks, &c., but it may now be remarked that red bricks,\r\nin practically all cases, owe their colour to the effects of firing\r\non iron. It is a great mistake to imagine, however, that a large\r\npercentage of iron in a clay will necessarily produce a good red tint.\r\nIn the first place, a great deal depends on the way the clay has been\r\nmixed or prepared; and in the second, the method of burning and the\r\ntemperature employed, taken in conjunction with the general composition\r\nof the earth, are all important. This much may be said, however,\r\nthat without the iron (or some mineral colouring matter possessing\r\nsimilar properties in the kiln) a red brick would not result. An even\r\ncolour is the effect of thorough and homogeneous incorporation of\r\nthe iron with the brick-earth; that may have been brought about by\r\nnatural processes, but it is most frequently obtained in the careful\r\npreparation and mixing of the clays. A very essential point is that\r\nthe earths must be of such a character as to withstand the requisite\r\nheat in the kiln without becoming vitreous, or twisting or warping.\r\nIt must not be forgotten that a certain proportion of the iron, under\r\ngreat temperatures, may be carried away out of the kiln in union with\r\nother things, in the form of vapour. To successfully treat a raw earth,\r\nso that all these points may be taken into account, and to produce a\r\nthoroughly uniform red brick, that shall not vary in tint from kiln\r\nto kiln, is a matter requiring considerable skill and attention,\r\nthough fairly good bricks of that character have been produced by\r\nsheer accident in burning natural earths fairly rich in thoroughly\r\ndisseminated iron oxides.\r\n\r\nTwo minerals commonly met with in earths used for brickmaking\r\nare pyrite and marcasite, both of which are of the same chemical\r\ncomposition, namely, iron disulphide. We may first consider them\r\nseparately, for they are of great importance to the brickmaker.\r\n\r\nIron pyrite occurs as regular cubic crystals, or irregular streaks,\r\nor as nodules or lumps; in clay, the last-mentioned is its commonest\r\nform. It is a good petrifying medium, so that it is frequently\r\nassociated with organic remains, as is exemplified in almost any yard\r\nwhere stiff clay is being worked. The nodules, on being broken open,\r\nordinarily exhibit a radiating structure of brassy lustre and extremely\r\nbeautiful appearance, though often marred by brown iron stains due to\r\ndecomposition of the mineral. In the refuse of slates, now so largely\r\nused in several parts of the world for brickmaking, pyrite is most\r\nfrequently found as fine cubic crystals of a durable nature.\r\n\r\nMarcasite, on the other hand, crystallizes in a different manner (in\r\nthe rhombic system of mineralogists), but is chiefly found in fibrous\r\nmasses or dirty-brown nodules, the last-mentioned being common in\r\nclays. When bright it is paler in tint than pyrite, though this is not\r\na constant character. It occurs abundantly in almost all sedimentary\r\nrocks diffused as minute particles, but sometimes in irregular layers.\r\nSir Archibald Geikie states[5] that this form of the sulphide is\r\nespecially characteristic of stratified rocks, and more particularly\r\nof those of Secondary and Tertiary age. That it is not abundant in\r\nPrimary rocks is not to be wondered at when we consider its liability\r\nto rapid decomposition; indeed, for it to be preserved at all it must\r\nbe well shielded from atmospheric agents by Nature. Exposure even for\r\na short time to the air causes it to become brown, free sulphuric acid\r\nis produced, which may attack surrounding minerals, sometimes at once\r\nforming sulphates, at other times decomposing aluminous silicates and\r\ndissolving them in considerable quantity. It plays even a larger part\r\nthan pyrite as a petrifying medium, at any rate in the younger rocks.\r\nBoth pyrite and marcasite are abundant in many other rocks than those\r\nof special interest to the brickmaker; the former, in fact, is almost\r\nuniversal in its occurrence.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to consider the behaviour of these two minerals\r\nin the kiln together, as the difference between them from that point\r\nof view is practically _nil_. Under the action of the intense heat\r\nmet with there, they become partially decomposed; oxide of iron and\r\nbasic sulphides of iron remain. When, at a subsequent period, bricks\r\ncontaining these substances are exposed to the action of the weather,\r\noxidation takes place, sulphate of iron and sometimes of lime are\r\nformed, which on crystallizing expand with considerable force and split\r\nor crack the brick. From this it is evident that sulphide of iron\r\nin any form is not to be tolerated in brick manufacture, and if the\r\nearth used in the first place contains much, it must be removed in the\r\npreparing process. If permitted to remain, it is impossible to obtain\r\neither a durable, or a good coloured brick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMINERALS: THEIR BEHAVIOUR IN THE KILN (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCITE, ARAGONITE, &c.\r\n\r\nCarbonate of lime may occur in a crystalline form, or as earthy\r\nsubstances, and many varieties of it are found in clays used by the\r\nbrickmaker. The commonest are calcite, aragonite, and a white earth.\r\n\r\nCalcite, known also as calc-spar, crystallises in the hexagonal system,\r\nthough true hexagons are not very common. It occurs principally as\r\nrhombohedra and scalenohedra, with variations therefrom; also fibrous,\r\nlamellar, granular, compact, nodular, and stalactitic. When pure,\r\ncalcite is colourless and usually transparent, but when mixed with iron\r\nor other mineral colouring matter it commonly assumes yellow and brown\r\ntints.\r\n\r\nAragonite is also a crystalline form of carbonate of lime, but is by no\r\nmeans as common in Nature as calcite. It crystallises in the rhombic\r\nsystem, which assists the mineralogist to distinguish it from the\r\nlast-mentioned mineral, from which it differs also in being harder and\r\nof higher specific gravity. Aragonite may occur as globular masses,\r\nor as incrusting other substances, or in the stalactitic form. It is\r\nsometimes white, but more often yellowish, or grey, and it is not,\r\ncommonly, as transparent as calcite, whilst it often possesses one to\r\ntwo per cent. of carbonate of strontia, or other impurity.\r\n\r\nIt is generally stated that carbonate of lime, when deposited from cold\r\nsolutions, crystallizes in hexagonal (calcite), and when from warm\r\nsolutions, in rhombic (aragonite) forms. No doubt, on the whole, that\r\nis the case; but we ought not to forget that many marine organisms\r\nmake their hard parts of aragonite, which, under the circumstances, is\r\ncertainly not obtained from warm solutions. These crystalline forms of\r\ncarbonate of lime are both of them found in fossil shells and the like\r\nin clays, and in not a few instances the calcareous constituent found\r\nin the brick-earth is present almost exclusively in the fossils, which\r\nare ground up with the rest in preparing the material for the moulding\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nWhen present as hard crystalline lumps or pebbles, they have been\r\nderived from the destruction of limestones, and are then the greatest\r\nnuisance imaginable to the brickmaker and the most dangerous\r\nconstituent at the same time. With proper machinery these hard lumps\r\nmay be ground down to fine particles, but they are even then only to be\r\nadmitted into the earth on sufferance. The best plan, without doubt,\r\nis to remove them altogether from the raw earth. They are commonly met\r\nwith in what the geologist calls “boulder clay”--a deposit owing its\r\norigin to glaciers and icebergs. Very often the pebbles alluded to\r\nare not crystalline, but of an earthy character, as is the case when\r\nmade of chalk. In the semi-dry process of manufacture, it is next to\r\nimpossible to incorporate the ground-up particles of carbonate lime\r\nsufficiently well to result in the production of such a homogeneous\r\nearth as is desirable for making a first-class brick.\r\n\r\nIn sandy clays or loams, and in a few stiff clays used for brickmaking,\r\ncertain remarkable concretions called “race” are found, the deleterious\r\nproperties whereof are so well known to the average brickmaker that\r\nhe carefully avoids the particular strata in which they occur. It is\r\nfortunate that these concretions have a habit of being confined to\r\nnarrow limits along definite horizons in the brickyard section, so that\r\nthey may be readily discarded in working. But that is not always the\r\ncase, and little nodules of “race” are usually more or less frequent\r\nalso in the beds above and below the horizons referred to. They are\r\ncomposed wholly of carbonate of lime, and their general effect in the\r\nkiln, and afterwards, will presently be explained. Other forms of\r\nconcretions are known as “septaria,”--tabular or rounded masses of\r\nargillaceous limestone found in practically all stiff clays. These are\r\noften of enormous size, and are disposed in regular lines which the\r\nfield geologist takes to indicate bedding planes in the clay--otherwise\r\noften very difficult to make out. In certain stiff clays little pellets\r\nof the same substance are found. The larger septaria have commonly been\r\ncracked in various directions, the fissures being subsequently filled\r\nwith calcite.\r\n\r\nCoprolites are impure varieties of phosphate of lime, and the term\r\nshould, properly speaking, be restricted to a substance of organic\r\norigin,--the fossilised excrement of animals. But the name is now\r\nloosely employed to designate phosphatic concretions in general, such\r\nas are commonly found in stiff clays, in certain “greensands,” and in\r\nother sedimentary deposits. The dark brown phosphate of lime has formed\r\non and often completely envelopes many fossils; in certain cases it\r\nhas in fact been utilised as a petrifying medium, in which form it\r\nordinarily occurs in the thick black clays of Peterborough, Cambridge,\r\nthe gault of Kent, Surrey, etc.\r\n\r\nSumming up the effects of carbonates and other kinds of lime in the\r\nkiln, it may be at once said that when present in any other form than\r\nas extremely minute particles, they are distinctly to be avoided. The\r\nsmall pellets and large pebbles especially are to be avoided, for the\r\nfollowing reasons. Carbonate of lime is made up of lime and carbonic\r\nacid; if a lump of this be subjected to great heat and thus calcined,\r\nthe carbonic acid is driven off, escaping by means of flues, the\r\nopen chimney, or kiln. The product is lime pure and simple--ordinary\r\nbuilders’ lime. Everyone knows that on the addition of water builders’\r\nlime becomes “slacked,” and eventually, after a fashion, “sets.”\r\nPrecisely the same thing occurs in the brick-kiln. The raw brick is\r\noften composed of pieces of chalk or other limestone, in limestone\r\ndistricts and in areas where boulder clays are largely employed for\r\nbrickmaking. On being subjected to the heat of the kiln these pieces\r\nare promptly reduced to the condition of lime. During the process\r\nof conversion considerable expansion takes place, and subsequently\r\ncontraction, leading to the formation of cracks radiating from the\r\nfragments of limestone, the homogeneity of the bricks being at once\r\ndestroyed. Apart from this, when placed in the open air the lime\r\nbecomes slacked, and the quality of the brick is seriously impaired.\r\n\r\nLime is a highly refractory substance, strongly basic in character,\r\nand forms fusible compounds with silica and other acid bodies. It is,\r\ntherefore, useful as a flux in many earths used in brickmaking, being\r\nadded to them expressly for that purpose, to the general improvement\r\nof the brick. The celebrated Dinas bricks, for instance, are composed\r\nof a highly refractory earth containing about 97 per cent. silica, the\r\nremainder being lime, oxide of iron, alumina, alkali and water. To\r\nrender this material fusible and so as to make refractory bricks, from\r\n1 to 3 per cent. of lime is added.\r\n\r\nBut what we more particularly desire to draw the reader’s attention\r\nto at the present stage, is not the employment of lime in making\r\nfire-bricks so much as its mixture with ordinary brick-earth, as in the\r\nmanufacture of malm bricks. Sometimes the mixture has been effected\r\nby Nature, as is the case with true marls; but the brickmaker does\r\nnot care so much for these, as without considerable and expensive\r\nartificial assistance they do not often make readily saleable bricks.\r\nThe common practice is, briefly, to grind chalk or similar earthy\r\nlimestone in the wet state, and then to introduce it to the brick-earth\r\nwith which it is thoroughly incorporated; and there are many ways of\r\ndoing this, which we shall not attempt to describe now. The object\r\nof adding chalk to the brick-earth is twofold; in the first place\r\nit assists in diminishing the contraction of the brick on drying,\r\n_i.e._, before burning; and secondly, it acts as a flux in the kiln\r\nby combining with the free silica, or the silicates, in the earth.\r\nUndoubtedly the second is, theoretically, its chief function; but its\r\nbeneficial effects in that direction are largely marred by insufficient\r\nburning, whereby a large proportion of the chalk is not actively\r\nengaged, as may be seen on examining the majority of malm bricks with\r\nthe microscope. Indeed, the eagerness to save fuel, and to turn out the\r\nbricks as rapidly as possible, often leads to the chalk particles being\r\nutterly useless. And, if we may judge from conversations with several\r\nbrickmakers, it would seem that the real reason why the limestone is\r\nused at all is unknown to them, except that it produces bricks of a\r\nsaleable colour. This question of colour is the all-predominating one\r\nwith most malm brickmakers.\r\n\r\nWe said just now that the fragments of limestone in the raw brick are\r\nreduced to lime on being burnt; some of the latter, however, as may be\r\nanticipated from our subsequent remarks, is engaged in forming a flux\r\nwherever possible in the immediate neighbourhood of such fragments:\r\nit is the “kernel” that is left which becomes “slacked,” and weakens\r\nthe brick. The object of utilising the smallest particles only of\r\nthe carbonate of lime is thus obvious; and if it were possible to\r\nuse ordinary builders’ lime instead of carbonate of lime, the result\r\nwould be better still. The difficulty in utilising builders’ lime is,\r\nof course, its certainty of slacking during the preparation of the\r\nbrick-earth with which it would have to be thoroughly incorporated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELENITE.\r\n\r\nThe “petrified water” of the brickmaker. It is a crystalline form of\r\ngypsum--a hydrous sulphate of lime, occurring in large quantities in\r\nthe commonest clays used in brickmaking. Large and beautiful crystals,\r\nsome of them radiating from a central point, are found in the London\r\nClay, Kimeridge Clay, Oxford Clay, &c. By expelling the water from\r\nselenite, or gypsum, plaster of Paris may be prepared. In the kiln,\r\ntherefore, it is important that this constituent be as finely ground as\r\npossible, so as to localise the effects of the anhydrous sulphate on\r\nbeing moistened subsequently. In hard burnt bricks, no doubt, a great\r\ndeal of it is effectively used as a flux to other constituents of the\r\nclay; but in by far the larger quantity of bricks this sulphate is\r\nreduced to fine powdery particles easily picked out as being softer and\r\nlighter in tint than the remaining constituents. The weather-resisting\r\nqualities of the brick are naturally, not improved when much baked\r\nselenite is present; and the colour of the whole is apt to become\r\nvariegated--that is, in a fairly soft brick.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOLOMITE.\r\n\r\nDolomite is, chemically, composed of the carbonates of lime and\r\nmagnesia in about equal proportions. It is found as rhombohedral\r\ncrystals, the faces of which are often curved; also in granular and\r\nmassive conditions. Its prevailing colour is light yellow both in\r\ncrystals and rock masses, but, as with most other minerals, impurities\r\noccasionally make it assume other tints, principally red and green.\r\nCarbonate of iron is frequently present, sometimes to such an extent as\r\nto entirely alter the character of the substance. As separate crystals\r\ndolomite has very little interest for us, though rarely it may take\r\nthe place of calcite or aragonite in the fossils of brick-earths and\r\nclays. But in its massive condition, as magnesian limestone, it is of\r\nincreasing importance to the brickmaker. For many years it has been\r\nutilised in the manufacture of basic bricks, though at the present\r\nmoment the market in these materials is attentively looking at the\r\npossibilities of the next mineral to be described.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNESITE.\r\n\r\nMagnesite is pure carbonate of magnesia--that is, magnesia = 47.6, and\r\ncarbonic acid 52.4 per cent. It usually occurs massive or fibrous,\r\nbut sometimes granular, and its fine rhombohedral crystals are well\r\nknown. Like dolomite, its prevailing tint is yellow or light brown,\r\nbut, when very pure, is as white as snow. It is usually associated\r\nwith serpentine rocks. In the kiln it is highly refractory, and\r\nbehaves very much in the same way as lime--forming fusible compounds\r\nwith silica and silicates. For the higher grades of basic bricks it\r\nis at this moment largely exploited in the few localities where it\r\noccurs in paying quantities. A few years since, investigation to\r\ndetermine the best basic refractory material was actively prosecuted\r\nin Germany, and magnesia, preheated at the highest white heat, was\r\nawarded the palm. Magnesite, when calcined, yields magnesia, which,\r\nhowever, still contains the impurities that might have been present in\r\nthe raw material. An average percentage composition of the magnesite\r\nof commerce shows it to contain magnesia 45, carbonic acid 50, lime\r\n1.5, protoxide of iron 1.6, the remainder being silica, alumina,\r\nand protoxide of manganese. The presence of silica in magnesite is\r\nan objection, because it is liable to have a fluxing effect at high\r\ntemperatures.\r\n\r\nMagnesite has been found in paying quantities in California, Styria,\r\nand recently in Greece. In Eubœa, in the last-mentioned country,\r\nthe mineral occurs in lodes which, near Krimasi, are worked on two\r\nlevels 30 to 40 feet from the top, and dipping at an angle of about\r\n70 degrees. The general average of the lode gives 88 per cent. of\r\ncarbonate of magnesia, and the substance is peculiarly suitable for\r\nthe manufacture of basic bricks. A novelty with the raw material is\r\nthat the proprietors sell either by guaranteed degree, or degree of\r\nanalysis, the former being 95 per cent. of pure magnesia, whilst the\r\nlatter often gives as much as 97.8 per cent. In inferior grades the\r\nprincipal increase is in the proportion of silica.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALT.\r\n\r\nChloride of sodium, or common salt, is present in many natural clays,\r\nespecially (in England) in that formation known to geologists as the\r\nTrias, developed largely in Cheshire. The influence of a salt-bearing\r\nbed is, naturally, not confined to the immediate vicinity of the\r\nformation; salt being so readily soluble in water, it comes forth from\r\nthe rocks in springs, which, flowing over loams and other similar\r\nabsorbent earths, impart a saline character to them. In this manner\r\notherwise useful earths for brickmaking are rendered absolutely unfit\r\nfor the purpose. Salt is one of the most powerful fluxes known; when\r\nmixed even in very small quantities with clay it becomes impossible\r\nto make a good brick of the substance. But we must recur to this\r\nmatter at a later period in another connection. The fluxing property\r\nis sometimes taken advantage of by mixing salt with sand in moulding,\r\nor in employing a sand already saline, as when dredged from the sea,\r\nor obtained between tide-marks. A species of glaze is produced on the\r\nbrick by the action of such moulding sand.\r\n\r\nWe may ignore the presence of a number of minerals such as rutile,\r\naugite, and hornblende in brick-earths, as they only exist therein in\r\nsuch small proportion, and have no appreciable effect in the kiln.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMISTRY OF BRICK-EARTHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction: THE BLOWPIPE.\r\n\r\nIt is not our intention to write an elementary treatise on chemistry;\r\nbut we know it is the custom for brickmakers to have chemical analyses\r\nof their raw earths made, and we are aware also that the precise\r\nmeaning to be attached to these analyses is very little understood. Our\r\nprincipal aim in introducing this subject, then, is to interpret, in an\r\nelementary manner, certain typical analyses of earths and substances\r\nused in brickmaking; but before doing so we shall explain some easy\r\nmethods of examining earths by means of the blowpipe, which will not\r\nmerely give some insight into their chemical constitution, but will\r\nafford the intelligent brickmaker a means of investigation which he can\r\nhimself put into practice.\r\n\r\nThe results of a chemical analysis of a compound earth, as ordinarily\r\nused by the brickmaker, widely differ from those obtained by a\r\nmineralogical or petrological examination. The petrologist views\r\nthe earth as a mineral aggregate, the constituents of which may be\r\nascertained on appeal to a properly-constructed microscope--that is, in\r\nthe majority of instances. By noting the relative proportions of the\r\ndifferent minerals, he is enabled to state, with approximate accuracy,\r\nwhat is the ultimate chemical composition of the whole. From this it\r\nwould appear that a rough chemical analysis could be drawn up by the\r\npetrologist without having recourse to the ordinary methods of chemical\r\ninvestigation. And in a limited sense that is true. But we should not\r\nlose sight of the fact that there is, in too many cases, an amorphous\r\nresiduum in earths, the nature whereof the microscope is powerless to\r\nreveal. It is upon this remnant that the chemist should direct his most\r\ncareful attention.\r\n\r\nThe mineralogist also can give a shrewd idea of the chemical\r\ncomposition of a brick-earth by using a blowpipe and accessories. This,\r\nin fact, may be regarded as a chemical means of investigation; but\r\nit possesses this serious drawback, viz., the blowpipe only yields a\r\nqualitative, and not a quantitative analysis. In other words, it can\r\ntell us something concerning chemical compounds present in an earth,\r\nbut rarely informs us as to the relative proportions of them. Even\r\nthis, however, is of great service in many instances, though it does\r\nnot possess the value of a quantitative analysis. For example, we\r\nhave stated previously that certain ingredients are very undesirable\r\nin a brick-earth, even in minute quantities; and that fact becomes of\r\nincreased value if we extend the field to earths used in terra-cotta,\r\nand china and porcelain manufacture. Now, the blowpipe is a handy\r\ninstrument; it may be carried about by the prospector with its usual\r\naccessories, and occupies but little space. Suppose he discovers a bed\r\nof white earth which he believes to be good china-clay; he can prove\r\nthat fact, or at least obtain a great deal of information to that\r\nend, by the mere use of that useful little instrument. Knowing, for\r\nexample, that fluorine is an undesirable constituent in such a clay for\r\nmany high-class purposes, he might test first of all for that; iron,\r\nperhaps, may come next, and so in a few minutes he is enabled to arrive\r\nat some valuable particulars that would take much longer to obtain by\r\nchemistry in the wet way.\r\n\r\nIt will be profitable, therefore, for us to briefly describe the\r\nblowpipe and the most common of its accessories, stating results\r\nobtained in dealing with substances frequently met with in\r\nbrick-earths. With but little practice anyone can use the instrument,\r\nthough, as with most other methods of scientific investigation, it\r\nrequires expert knowledge to yield really excellent results. The simple\r\nminerals and compounds to which we shall direct attention may be\r\ndetected with the greatest ease.\r\n\r\nThe essential constituents of a blowpipe outfit are as follow:--\r\n\r\n  1. Blowpipe.\r\n  2. Lamp.\r\n  3. Platinum-pointed forceps.\r\n  4. Platinum wire.\r\n  5. Charcoal.\r\n  6. Glass tubes.\r\n  7. Chemical reagents.\r\n  8. Miscellaneous articles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Blowpipes.]\r\n\r\n_1. The Blowpipe._--Common forms of blowpipe are shown in fig. 5. A\r\nmay be described as follows. It consists of three separate parts: a\r\ntube _a b_ having a mouthpiece; an air chamber _c_ to retain moisture\r\ncaused by the breath of the person blowing; and a side tube _d_ ending\r\nin a platinum-tipped jet. Another form of blowpipe, which, however,\r\ndoes not differ essentially from that just alluded to, is shown in\r\nfig. 5, B. It is not absolutely necessary to have the jet made of or\r\ntipped with platinum, though certain examinations with the instrument\r\nare facilitated by the use of such a tip. An essential point is, that\r\nthe hole in the jet should be of proper size, usually about 0.4 mm. The\r\ntrumpet-shaped mouthpiece shown in the diagram may be dispensed with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Blowpipe Lamp, &c.]\r\n\r\n_2. The Lamp, or Candle._--A convenient form of lamp is a Bunsen\r\ngas-burner furnished with a special jet (fig. 6, A). For certain\r\npurposes, however, this flame cannot be employed, as when testing a\r\nsubstance for sulphur, as coal-gas frequently contains sufficient\r\nsulphur to vitiate results. Moreover, in country districts and in\r\nthe field coal-gas is not always procurable. A convenient form of\r\nlamp, though rather too large for transporting purposes, is known as\r\nBerzelius’ blowpipe lamp. This, as improved by Plattner, is shown in\r\nfig. 6 B. This consists of an oil vessel on a stand provided with\r\ntwo openings closed with screw-caps, the one opening being used for\r\ncharging the lamp with oil, the other being fitted with a burner\r\nbearing a flat wick. The lamp may be adjusted to any required height\r\non the stand by means of a screw. Olive oil, or refined rape oil,\r\nis usually burnt. A spirit lamp with a flat wick is sometimes used.\r\nIn countries where neither coal-gas, alcohol, nor oil are readily\r\navailable, the prospector may use a small grease lamp. This consists\r\nof a cylindrical box of thin metal having a wick-holder soldered on\r\none side, through which a flattened wick is drawn. The box may then be\r\nfilled with grease, solid paraffin, old candle-ends, or fat of similar\r\ndescription. Professor Cole describes[6] it as follows:--When brought\r\ninto use the wick is lighted, and the flame directed with the blowpipe\r\nupon the surface of the solid tallow or fat, until this is melted to\r\na depth of about a quarter of an inch. The lamp will then become hot\r\nenough during use for a continuous supply to be maintained; but it is\r\nstill better to hold the lamp with the pliers over a spirit lamp until\r\nall the contents become fluid. When about half or three-quarters empty,\r\nit is well to drop in extra lumps of fuel--a single candle-end or\r\nso--during use, and this additional material becomes melted up slowly\r\nwith the rest. The wick must be freely supplied with fluid fuel, or it\r\nwill char and waste away. If the lamp is kept sufficiently hot, the\r\nwick will not require raising during a day’s work; but it can be easily\r\nthrust up with a knife point after the flame has been at work a few\r\nminutes. A cylindrical cap fits down upon the lamp when put aside. For\r\nmany ordinary purposes a good carriage-candle may be employed to give a\r\nblowpipe flame, but candles have the disadvantage of not remaining at a\r\nconstant level--an important point when one is comfortably at work.\r\n\r\n_3. Platinum-pointed Forceps._--At least one pair of forceps is needed,\r\nand it should preferably be made of steel, nickel-plated to prevent\r\nrusting. One end has platinum points self-closing by means of a spring,\r\nso that the piece of mineral to be heated, placed between them, may\r\nbe firmly supported. At the other end are other forceps of ordinary\r\npattern for picking up small fragments; this end, however, should never\r\nbe placed in the flame. A pair of common self-closing forceps might\r\nalso be at hand for holding test-tubes, etc., in the flame.\r\n\r\n_4. Platinum Wire._--A few inches of thin platinum wire are\r\nindispensable, and lengths of an inch or so may be fixed into suitable\r\nhandles. A convenient method is to have a small glass rod for a handle,\r\nand by fusing the tip of one end of the rod the glass may readily be\r\nmade to hold the piece of wire. Pieces of platinum foil are useful,\r\nalso, as will presently be seen.\r\n\r\n_5. Charcoal._--The outfit should comprise several pieces of charcoal,\r\nand a convenient form for each piece is a circular disc about an inch\r\nin diameter, flat at the top and convex beneath. Long prisms of the\r\nsame material, square in section, are occasionally required; these may\r\nbe up to 6 inches, or so, in length.\r\n\r\n_6. Glass Tubes._--These should be of hard glass, small, of several\r\ndiameters, the bore being large enough to place fragments of minerals\r\nor earthy substances within. Closed tubes, such as test-tubes, are\r\nalways requisite.\r\n\r\n_7. Chemical Reagents._--These are, for the most part, used as fluxes,\r\nand those most commonly employed are borax (sodium tetraborate),\r\nsoda (sodium carbonate), and salt of phosphorus or microcosmic salt\r\n(phosphate of soda and ammonia). Small quantities of potassium\r\nbisulphate (in a glass bottle), as also small bottles of hydrochloric,\r\nnitric, and sulphuric acids, and a solution of cobalt nitrate, are also\r\nuseful in certain cases. It is hardly necessary to remark that the\r\nchemicals employed must be of the highest degree of purity.\r\n\r\n_8. Miscellaneous Articles._--Strips of test paper, both turmeric and\r\nblue litmus, a small hammer, a steel anvil about an inch cube, a bar\r\nmagnet, a pair of cutting pliers, a three-cornered file, and a few\r\nsmall watch-glasses are very desirable, though not absolutely essential.\r\n\r\nThe reader, on glancing at the foregoing formidable list of articles,\r\nmay possibly imagine that some considerable outlay is requisite, and\r\nthat they must occupy much space. But that is not the case. An ordinary\r\nblowpipe, a grease lamp, a small spirit lamp, and all the articles\r\nmentioned in paragraphs 3 to 8, both inclusive, occupy but a small\r\nspace. They may be packed in a box specially fitted, and one in the\r\nwriter’s possession, containing all of them, measures only 10 inches by\r\n5 inches by 3¼ inches, and is less than 3 lbs. in weight.\r\n\r\nNow, as to the use of these various things. First of all, let us\r\nexamine the flame, as produced by a candle, which is typical of flames\r\nobtained by other means described, except the Bunsen lamp. A candle\r\nflame (see fig. 7) consists of the following parts:--\r\n\r\n1. A dark core (_a_), which contains the gaseous products of\r\ndecomposition given off by the melted tallow drawn up by the wick.\r\n\r\n2. A highly luminous zone (_b_), in which only partial burning of the\r\ncombustible gases takes place. In this, oxygen from the air combines\r\nchiefly with the combustible hydrogen, whilst the carbon is separated\r\nin a highly heated state, which causes the luminosity.\r\n\r\n3. An outer mantle of blue tint (_c_), where the oxygen of the air is\r\nalways present in excess, so that the separated carbon is here burnt.\r\nThe highest temperature is found in this part of the flame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Candle and Gas Flames.]\r\n\r\nTechnically, the outermost zone (_c_) is known as the _oxidising_\r\nflame, and the inner luminous zone (_b_) the _reducing_ flame. The\r\ntwo portions of the candle flame act in different manners on specific\r\nmineral substances, and the blowpipe operator may use either of them\r\nat will. The method of doing this is illustrated in the same figure.\r\nTo obtain the reducing flame, the blowpipe jet is brought to the edge\r\nof the flame a little distance above the burner, or wick. The operator\r\nthen produces a gentle blast, which deflects the latter (upper figure)\r\nwithout altogether passing into it, so that the flame is still charged\r\nwith glowing carbon. A yellowish luminous flame is the result, the most\r\nactive part of which lies at a short distance from the end.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the oxidising flame is utilised by passing the\r\nblowpipe jet a little farther into the flame (lower figure) and blowing\r\nmore strongly. A pointed non-luminous flame is the result. This will\r\nbe seen to possess an inner blue cone, before the point of which the\r\nhottest part is situated. Substances to be fused are placed in this\r\npart of the flame, whilst those to be oxidised are placed a little\r\nfarther away, in order that they may be exposed to the air at the time\r\nthey are being highly heated.\r\n\r\nThe “platinum wire” is an absolutely indispensable adjunct to a\r\nblowpipe outfit, and is employed as follows:--A short piece of\r\nthe wire, an inch or so in length, being attached to a handle, as\r\npreviously described, the free end of it is bent into a loop about the\r\nsize of this O. This may be heated in the flame employed, or, better\r\nstill, in the flame of a spirit lamp, and, when hot enough, it may be\r\ndipped into a small quantity of the powdered borax or microcosmic salt,\r\nsome of which will be found to adhere to the wire. On further heating\r\nthe borax it will swell out and form a number of irregular bubbles,\r\nwhich (heat still being applied) will subsequently settle down into a\r\nclear, colourless bead in the loop of the platinum wire. A satisfactory\r\nbead having now been made, a portion of the mineral substance to be\r\nanalysed (in the shape of small grains) is taken up by dipping the\r\nheated borax bead therein.\r\n\r\nThe actual operation of determining the nature of the substance then\r\ncommences. Using the blowpipe, and directing either the _reducing_\r\nflame (R.F.), or the _oxidising_ flame (O.F.), on to the substance on\r\nthe borax, according to circumstances presently to be detailed, the\r\noperator notes the change in colour (if any) of the flame yielded by\r\nthe process. At this point a very annoying thing sometimes happens;\r\nfor, in liquefying the borax bead, it is apt to fall off the wire, and\r\nanother bead has then to be made. To avoid this, great care should\r\nbe taken not to blow too vigorously at first. With the microcosmic\r\nsalt especial care and dexterity must be exercised in this connection.\r\nIf all goes well, the powdered mineral substance (if fusible in the\r\nborax) readily melts down, and becomes incorporated with the borax. On\r\npermitting the latter to cool, which it very rapidly does, the bead\r\nshould now be carefully examined, and any change in tint noted. Most\r\nbeautiful transparent colours, pregnant with meaning, are often seen to\r\nhave formed with the borax as flux.\r\n\r\nThe operator may test his skill by making the following brilliant\r\nexperiments. Take up a few small fragments of the mineral malachite (a\r\ncarbonate of copper) by means of the clear, colourless, heated borax\r\nbead, and then introduce them to the _oxidising_ flame. They slowly\r\ndissolve in the borax, and, whilst doing so, the tip of the blowpipe\r\nflame becomes emerald-green in colour. After applying this flame for a\r\nminute or two, the whole of the mineral will have become incorporated\r\nwith the borax, and, when the bead is still hot, note that it is also\r\nof a rich green tint, but that, on cooling, it turns blue. If too much\r\nmalachite has been taken up in the first instance, a very dark green\r\ntint is imparted, which still remains when the bead is cold, and it\r\nappears to be quite black. Its true colour, however, may be ascertained\r\nby flattening the bead out before it is quite cold. It is always well\r\nto begin by using a small quantity of the mineral substance at first,\r\nand adding to this as may be required.\r\n\r\nAssuming that a fine rich green bead has been produced, and that it\r\ncontains a relatively large amount of copper, the operator may now\r\nhold it in the _reducing_ flame and re-melt the bead; if the operation\r\nhas been conducted carefully, the bead will then show red, and be\r\npractically opaque when cold. The red bead may now be re-heated in the\r\n_oxidising_ flame, when it will be found once more to return to a green\r\ncolour. The student will find this easy operation excellent practice,\r\nas proving to him, in the absence of a demonstrator, that he is really\r\nable to recognise and use the oxidising and reducing flames at will.\r\nMany mineral substances yield a distinctive colour in this way--a\r\nuseful factor in a qualitative analysis.\r\n\r\nBefore using the platinum wire, be careful to ascertain that it is\r\nquite clean; a borax bead made thereon should be perfectly white and\r\ntransparent.\r\n\r\nThe “platinum foil” is employed as a support during fusions; pieces\r\nabout an inch and a half long, by half an inch in width, are generally\r\nused. A small platinum spoon is sometimes adopted when fusing\r\nsubstances with acid, potassium, sulphate, or nitre.\r\n\r\nMinerals may be tested to see whether, in the ordinary blowpipe flame,\r\nthey are fusible or not. To do this, a fragment of the substance to be\r\ntested is held in the flame by means of the “platinum-pointed forceps.”\r\nIf the mineral is found to be fusible, then its “degree of fusibility”\r\nmay be ascertained according to the following table. The “degrees of\r\nfusibility” are six in number:--\r\n\r\n  1. Fusible in ordinary gasflame, even in large fragments. Example:\r\n     _Stibnite_, or grey antimony.\r\n\r\n  2. Fusible in fine, thin pieces, in the ordinary gasflame, and in\r\n     larger fragments in the blowpipe-flame. Example: _Natrolite_, a\r\n     hydrous silicate of alumina and soda.\r\n\r\n  3. If very thin splinters be used, fusible without difficulty with\r\n     the blowpipe-flame. Example: _Almandite_, or iron-alumina-garnet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  4. In thin splinters fusible to a globule. Example: _Actinolite_, a\r\n     non-aluminous variety of hornblende.\r\n\r\n  5. Thin edges may be fused and rounded without great difficulty.\r\n     Example: _Orthoclase_ felspar--already described.\r\n\r\n  6. Fusible with great difficulty on the finest edges. Example:\r\n     _Bronzite_, one of the augite group of minerals.\r\n\r\nNow, it is highly probable that many of our readers will not\r\nunderstand, or be able to recognise the six minerals above enumerated;\r\nand we recommend those who may be sufficiently interested, to purchase\r\nthem from a mineral dealer--such as Damon, of Weymouth, or Russell, or\r\nGregory, or Henson, or Butler, in London. A set, comprising the six,\r\nshould cost from two to three shillings. With these, as a standard\r\nfor comparison, the operator readily grasps the method of assigning a\r\nfusible mineral to its proper degree in the scale.\r\n\r\nAnother object of examination in the forceps is to see what colour\r\n(if any) is imparted to the flame by the divers minerals experimented\r\nupon. It is a good rule not to permit the specimen, when being fused,\r\nto touch the forceps in the neighbourhood of the actual part fused. For\r\na mineral containing antimony or arsenic would tend to form a fusible\r\nalloy with the platinum points, and so ruin the forceps.\r\n\r\nThe pieces of “charcoal” alluded to in our inventory, are used for\r\nplacing the mineral substance upon in certain parts of the blowpipe\r\noperation, which may be briefly described. Essentially the charcoal\r\nforms a support to the substance during fusion; but the glowing carbon\r\nhas also a kind of reducing effect. Taking a long prism of charcoal,\r\nsuch as that described, page 63 _ante_, the mineral to be dealt\r\nwith should be placed near one end of a flat surface and the prism\r\nso held that the flame from the blowpipe, will sweep down its full\r\nlength. The object of so doing is to give a chance to any volatile\r\nsubstance (derived by the operation from the mineral) to deposit on\r\nthe comparatively cool surface, which deposit is often indicative of\r\nthe chemical nature of the mineral. To carry this point home, the\r\nfollowing experiments may be conducted by the student. Taking a piece\r\nof _stibnite_ (sulphide of antimony), which, as we have just learnt,\r\nis a most fusible mineral, we place it on the charcoal in the manner\r\nindicated. Whilst melting, and the blowpipe flame be continued to be\r\ndirected upon it after it has become fused, it will be noticed that a\r\nyellowish-white deposit is taking place on the length of charcoal; this\r\nis called a _sublimate_.\r\n\r\nMineral substances may also be assisted in fusing on the charcoal by\r\nusing the reagents described in our list of chemicals, &c., included in\r\na blowpipe set.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the use of the “glass tubes,” it may be remarked that they\r\nare used principally for the examination of minerals which yield a\r\nvolatile substance on being heated therein, and to detect the presence\r\nof water and the like. It is important to make a distinction between\r\nthe closed and the open tubes. When a mineral fragment is placed in a\r\ntube, closed at one end, whatever takes place will be in presence of\r\nvery little air, or oxygen; on the other hand, when the tube is open at\r\nboth ends, and is inclined during the experiment, a constant stream of\r\noxygen passes through the tube, and the mineral is being dealt with in\r\npresence of that. The employment of this oxygen makes a great deal of\r\ndifference in the results obtained, as a few elementary experiments\r\nwill show. If we place a piece of sulphur in a tube, closed at one\r\nend, and heat it gently, we notice that a yellow coating takes place\r\ninside the tube; but if we now employ a tube open at both ends and\r\nheat it very slowly indeed, we notice that the sulphur goes off as an\r\ninvisible gas, and if the experiment has been properly conducted, there\r\nshould hardly be a trace of the sulphur left on the glass. A number of\r\nexperiments of a similar nature might be quoted, but enough has been\r\nsaid for the present to show the utility of the tubes.\r\n\r\nThe “chemical reagents” alluded to have already been sufficiently\r\ndescribed to render any further discussion on them unnecessary for our\r\nimmediate purpose.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the “miscellaneous articles” mentioned, it may be remarked\r\nthat the test papers are employed in the detection of certain acids\r\nand bases; whilst a strip of brazil-wood paper is for the detection\r\nof fluorine. The hammer and anvil are for breaking the substance to\r\nbe tested into small fragments; the magnet for withdrawing particles\r\nof iron from the pulverised material; the three-cornered file for\r\nassisting in determining the relative hardness of minerals, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nIn examining substances before the blowpipe, it is highly desirable\r\nthat the various operations should be carried out in some definite\r\norder. The following has been found convenient:--\r\n\r\n  _a._ In a glass tube closed at one end.\r\n  _b._ In an open tube.\r\n  _c._ On charcoal.\r\n  _d._ With borax and microcosmic salt.\r\n  _e._ As to flame colouration.\r\n  _f._ With other reagents.\r\n\r\nThe size of the fragment to be dealt with in an examination, depends\r\non circumstances, but for ordinary purposes a piece of the size of a\r\nsmall rabbit-shot will be found sufficient.\r\n\r\nIt is convenient in this place to describe a few chemical reactions\r\nwithout the use of the blowpipe; that will render the effects on\r\ncertain minerals, presently to be mentioned, clearer to the reader.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it may be ascertained whether the mineral is soluble\r\nin water, and if so, to what extent. Then as to whether it becomes\r\nsoluble in certain acids, such as hydrochloric or nitric acid. The\r\nformer acid is generally used, except for metallic sulphides, and\r\nthose minerals containing heavy metals, such as lead, silver, &c.; the\r\nlatter is employed for the exceptions named. Several minerals, even\r\nwhen in a powdered state, are hardly, if at all, affected by acids. The\r\nresults to be noted during the test with acids, commonly fall into the\r\nfollowing three groups.[7]\r\n\r\nA. The mineral may dissolve quietly with or without colouring the\r\nsolution; this holds good, for example, with hematite (a variety of\r\niron), also of many of the sulphates and phosphates.\r\n\r\nB. There may be a bubbling off or effervescence of a gas, which gas is\r\nusually carbon dioxide; but may be hydrogen sulphide. Chlorine may be\r\nliberated, or reddish fumes of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nC. There may be separation of some insoluble substance as sulphur,\r\nsilica, &c.\r\n\r\nWe will close this chapter by stating the behaviour under blowpipe\r\nexamination of various minerals, given in preceding pages, as being\r\ncommon in clays and earths used in brickmaking:--\r\n\r\n_Quartz._--This is infusible, and remains undissolved, even in a\r\nmicrocosmic salt bead; but it fuses readily with soda, on charcoal.\r\nIn the flame it splinters into fragments, which fly off with great\r\nrapidity. It is soluble in hydrofluoric acid. _Flint_, when pure,\r\nbehaves in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n_Orthoclase Felspar._--Fusibility, 5; flame colouration brilliant\r\nyellow, when much sodium is present; not decomposed by hydrochloric\r\nacid. It may be distinguished from other common felspars by its high\r\ndegree of fusibility.\r\n\r\n_Oligoclase Felspar._--Gives a sodium yellow flame; fusibility, 3.5;\r\nnot decomposed by hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n_Biotite Mica._--With fluxes gives a strong iron reaction of yellowish\r\nred colour; decomposed in concentrated sulphuric acid, leaving a\r\nresidue of siliceous matter.\r\n\r\n_Muscovite Mica._--When heated in a tube closed at one end, yields\r\nwater which often gives fluorine reaction with brazil-wood test paper\r\nby colouring it straw-yellow; it is not decomposed by acids, and\r\nwhitens and fuses only on thin edges.\r\n\r\n_Kaolin._--Is infusible; gives off water when heated in a closed\r\ntube; and with cobalt nitrate on charcoal, a fine alumina reaction is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n_Aluminium._--On charcoal, this becomes blue with cobalt nitrate,\r\nthough if the surface is fused the reaction is not so clear. Prof. Cole\r\nadvises that the soda-residue be dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid,\r\nthen evaporated to dryness, re-dissolved in that acid water, filter\r\noff any silica, and neutralise with ammonia; alumina is precipitated\r\ntogether with any iron present. The precipitate, if white, or nearly\r\nso, may be tested with cobalt nitrate, and the result is a fine blue\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n_Limonite Iron._--Fusibility about 5; yellow and reddish beads;\r\nwater given off in closed tube; in reducing flame magnetic residue on\r\ncharcoal; soluble in hydrochloric acid after a short time.\r\n\r\n_Iron Pyrites._--Fusibility about 2; yellow and red beads; in closed\r\ntube yellow precipitate due to sulphur; magnetic after reduction on\r\ncharcoal; insoluble in hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n_Rock Salt._--Intense yellow sodium flame; fusibility about 1;\r\nmicrocosmic salt with copper oxide shows strong chlorine reaction--a\r\nfine blue flame surrounding the bead when re-introduced into the flame.\r\nIt is soluble in water.\r\n\r\n_Selenite_ (_Gypsum_).--Fusibility about 2.5; brilliant flame; in\r\nclosed tube it becomes white and opaque and much water is given off;\r\nwith soda, on charcoal, sulphur reactions are obtained; soluble in\r\nhydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n_Calcite_ (_Carbonate of Lime_).--Flame glows very strongly; infusible;\r\neffervesces freely in cold hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n_Dolomite._--Flame, with hydrochloric acid, like calcite; infusible;\r\neffervesces in hot hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n_Magnesite._--Infusible; with cobalt nitrate a fair magnesia reaction\r\non charcoal, _i.e._, turns into a dull pink; effervesces in hot\r\nhydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n_Manganese._--With borax in oxidising flame a red-violet bead is\r\nobtained, but with the reducing flame it is colourless.\r\n\r\nThe above are commonly met with in brick-earths; for other minerals\r\nand substances also found, the reader may be referred to special works\r\ndealing with blowpipe analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMISTRY OF BRICK-EARTHS (_Continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we shall fulfil our promise (_ante_ p. 58) to explain\r\nin an elementary manner the precise meaning of ordinary commercial\r\nchemical analyses of some typical earths used in brickmaking, etc. We\r\nmay commence by explaining a few terms used by the chemist.\r\n\r\nAn _atom_ is the smallest imaginable portion of matter, and all matter\r\nis said to consist of atoms. A _molecule_ is the smallest conceivable\r\ncombination of atoms, and every compound substance is ultimately built\r\nup of molecules. An _element_ is a substance that has hitherto defied\r\nthe efforts of the chemist to subdivide or split up. Over seventy of\r\nthese elementary substances are at present known, and their number is\r\nbeing constantly added to. Again, by improvement in analytical methods,\r\na so-called element may be subdivided, and thus removed from the list.\r\nThe elements are classified into _metals_ and _non-metals_; and it is\r\nconvenient to give each of them a symbol to save trouble in writing,\r\nand to render clearer to the reader the chemical nature of a compound\r\nbody. Thus, the symbol for the element aluminium is Al; for silicon Si;\r\nfor carbon C; for calcium Ca; for oxygen O; for iron Fe; for hydrogen\r\nH; for chlorine Cl; and so on.\r\n\r\nWe are taught by chemistry that elements are capable of combining only\r\nin definite proportions, and that each substance possesses a definite\r\nproportion peculiar to itself. That proportion is called the _atomic\r\nweight_ of the element; or, it is the relative weight of the atom of\r\neach substance compared with that of the lightest substance known,\r\nhydrogen.\r\n\r\nThus, the atomic weight of hydrogen being taken as 1, it is found that\r\nan atom of chlorine is 35.5 times as heavy as that, so that the atomic\r\nweight of chlorine is said to be 35.5. Now, in spite of the enormous\r\ndifference between the weight of the two elements just mentioned, they\r\ncombine in the same proportions by _volume_; and the union is known as\r\nhydrochloric acid, or HCl.\r\n\r\nBut in certain cases elements do not combine in equal proportions;\r\nfor instance, an atom of oxygen will not combine with less than two\r\nof hydrogen. Further, with this we find that the three volumes are\r\ncondensed into the space of two volumes--a very common phenomenon in\r\nthe chemical combination of gases. The union of hydrogen and oxygen\r\nalluded to forms water, the chemical symbol of which is, consequently,\r\nH2O.\r\n\r\n_Chemical affinity_, or _chemical attraction_, is the force which is\r\nexerted between molecules not of the same kind. Thus, in water, which,\r\nas we have seen, is composed of hydrogen and oxygen, it is affinity\r\nwhich unites these elements, but it is cohesion which binds together\r\ntwo molecules of water. In compound bodies, cohesion and affinity\r\noperate simultaneously; whilst in simple bodies, or elements, cohesion\r\nalone has to be considered. To affinity are due all the phenomena of\r\ncombustion and of chemical combination and decomposition.\r\n\r\nCertain gases, such as chlorine and nitrogen, and such substances\r\nas sulphur, carbon, and silicon, with many others, form _acids_ in\r\nconjunction with hydrogen, or hydrogen and oxygen. These combine\r\nwith greater or less facility with other elements which do not form\r\nacids, and are termed _bases_. A combination of an acid and a base is\r\nknown as a _salt_. Salts the names of which end in _-ide_, such as\r\nchloride, sulphide, etc., are combinations of a metal with a non-metal.\r\n_Monoxide_ means an oxide containing one atom of oxygen; _dioxide_ one\r\ncontaining two atoms; _protoxide_ means the first oxide, because it\r\nis the first or lowest of the oxides of the given metal in amount of\r\noxygen present; the highest oxide is often known as _peroxide_. The\r\nterminations _-ous_ and _-ic_ are frequently used for the lower and\r\nhigher oxides respectively. Examples:--\r\n\r\n  FeO, iron protoxide, or ferrous oxide.\r\n  Fe2O3, iron sesquioxide, or ferric oxide.\r\n  FeS2, iron disulphide.\r\n  Sb2S3, antimony trisulphide.\r\n\r\nThe following symbols may be indicated as referring to compounds\r\nespecially met with in brick-earths:--\r\n\r\n  CaO, lime, instead of calcium oxide.\r\n  Al2O3, alumina, instead of aluminium trioxide.\r\n  SiO2, silica, instead of silicon dioxide.\r\n  Na2O, soda, instead of sodium oxide.\r\n  K2O, potash, instead of potassium oxide.\r\n  MgO, magnesia, instead of magnesium oxide.\r\n\r\nIn _analysing_ a body, the first step consists in determining the\r\nnature of the elementary substances contained therein. That may be\r\naccomplished in the _dry way_ by means of the blowpipe and accessories,\r\nas explained in the last chapter. Such an examination, as previously\r\nremarked, is known as a _qualitative_ analysis. Or, it may be\r\naccomplished in the _wet way_ by ordinary chemical examination. The\r\nnext step is to determine the amount of the constituents present, and\r\nthat is known as a _quantitative_ analysis. In making a qualitative\r\nanalysis, the chemist is assisted by the knowledge that certain basic\r\nsubstances and certain acids produce peculiar phenomena in the\r\npresence of known substances or preparations termed _reagents_.\r\n\r\nThere is a great difference between a _chemical compound_ and a simple\r\n_mixture_ of elements; and it is not always easy (_e.g._, some alloys)\r\nto say whether a substance is in the one state or the other. This\r\ndistinction is well exemplified by the air we breathe. The chemist\r\nfinds by analysis that the air is nearly constant in composition,\r\ncontaining essentially in 100 parts 76.8 by weight of nitrogen\r\n(including about 1 per cent. of the recently-discovered element,\r\nargon), and 23.2 of oxygen. Small proportions of water vapour, carbon\r\ndioxide, etc., may be ignored for our present purposes. In view of this\r\ncomparatively uniform composition, the question at first arises as to\r\nwhether the air is, or is not, a chemical compound? The answer is in\r\nthe negative, for, amongst other things, it can be shown that the ratio\r\nof 76.8 to 23.2 is not that of the atomic weights of the two elements\r\npresent, viz., 14 : 16, nor of any simple multiples of these.\r\n\r\nWe will now quote a few analyses of well-known earths, and explain each\r\nin turn:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chemical Composition of China-clays._[8]\r\n\r\n  -----------+---------+---------------+-------------\r\n             | Kaolin. |Kaolin average.|Sandy Kaolin.\r\n             +---------+---------------+-------------\r\n  Silica     | 46.32   |    44.60      |    66.68\r\n  Alumina    | 39.74   |    44.30      |    26.08\r\n  Iron oxide |   .27   |      .20      |     1.26\r\n  Lime       |   .36 } |     1.60      |      .84\r\n  Magnesia   |   .44 } |               |    trace\r\n  Water      | 12.67   |     8.74      |     5.14\r\n  -----------+---------+---------------+-------------\r\n\r\nThe kaolin alluded to in the first column is a remarkably pure\r\nmaterial, perfectly white, and contains an enormous quantity of\r\nwater. It refers to one of the finest washed china-clays in the\r\nmarket, and is extensively used in porcelain manufacture. It is\r\nquoted here principally to give an idea of what a really pure clay is\r\nlike chemically. We notice that, in spite of its relative purity, it\r\ncontains .27 per cent. of iron oxide. This could have been well done\r\nwithout, from the manufacturer’s standpoint, but is of course a very\r\nminute proportion. Small as it is, it must exert a slight amount of\r\ncolouring influence. The lime and magnesia are present in slightly\r\nlarger proportions, and a little more of either would be advantageous\r\nrather than otherwise, as assisting to flux the material. This is an\r\nearth with which practically anything may be done by judicious blending\r\nand careful preparation.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the second column, the figures do not refer to any\r\nparticular clay, but they have been compiled to show the average\r\ncomposition of kaolins as used in the market. It will be observed that\r\nthe silica and alumina are present in approximately equal proportions,\r\nwhich is a characteristic of fairly good china-clays. The iron oxide\r\nremains as before, but there is a larger proportion of lime and\r\nmagnesia--as much as can be permitted except in a second-rate clay.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the third column shows that the sand in the china-clay\r\nis to a large extent quartzose, and this is at the expense of the\r\nalumina. Such a material would be suitable for making a species of\r\nwhite fire-brick, and it might do for the commoner kinds of china-ware.\r\nThe earth is really of the nature of a loam--a sandy clay. There is\r\ntoo much iron in it for the production of perfectly white goods. The\r\nproportion of lime might be increased to advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chemical Composition of Fire-clays from Newcastle-on-Tyne._[9]\r\n\r\n  ------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------\r\n              |   1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |   5   |   6   |    7\r\n              +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------\r\n  Silica      | 51.10 | 47.55 | 48.55 | 51.11 | 71.28 | 83.29 |  69.25\r\n  Alumina     | 31.35 | 29.50 | 30.25 | 30.40 | 17.75 |  8.10 |  17.90\r\n  Iron oxide  |  4.63 |  9.13 |  4.06 |  4.91 |} 2.43 |  1.88 |   2.97\r\n  Lime        |  1.46 |  1.34 |  1.66 |  1.76 |}      |       |}  1.30\r\n  Magnesia    |  1.54 |   .71 |  1.91 | trace |  2.30 |  2.99 |}\r\n  Water, etc. | 10.47 | 12.01 | 10.67 | 12.29 |  6.94 |  3.64 |   7.58\r\n  ------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------\r\n\r\nThe reader will see at a glance that the range of variation permissible\r\nin fire-clays is very wide. These earths are all found close together,\r\nand are utilised for similar purposes, though often blended to produce\r\ndesired results. It will be noticed that one of them (No. 6) contains\r\nas much as 83.29 of silica, whilst another has no more than 47.55 per\r\ncent. The range with reference to alumina is very wide also, from 8.10\r\npercent. (No. 6) to 31.35. The refractory character of any sample of\r\nfire-clay is determined by the proportions in which the silica and\r\nalumina are contained, and by the absence of lime, iron, and other\r\neasily fluxible substances. The proportion of iron discovered in sample\r\nNo. 2 is certainly much in excess of the requirements of the material,\r\nas a fire-clay, and this no doubt is tempered by admixture, unless\r\nutilised for inferior goods. The iron oxide in the other samples is\r\nabout sufficient for general purposes. The amount of lime present in\r\nall the samples constitutes a good feature; much lime cannot on any\r\naccount be allowed in earths for fire-clay goods. With so much iron\r\npresent, and the fair proportions of magnesia (except in sample No.\r\n4) these clays may be regarded as typical, with the exception of\r\nNo. 6. They have been utilised for many years in the manufacture of\r\nfire-bricks and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chemical Composition of Fire-clays, from Welsh localities._\r\n\r\n  ------------+-------+-------+-------\r\n              |   1   |   2   |   3\r\n              +-------+-------+-------\r\n  Silica      | 50.35 | 56.90 | 54.80\r\n  Alumina     | 23.50 | 24.90 | 27.60\r\n  Iron oxide  | 10.40 |  2.83 |  2.56\r\n  Soda        |  1.55 |  3.00 |  2.00\r\n  Magnesia    |  1.45 |  1.07 |  1.00\r\n  Water, etc. | 11.85 | 11.60 | 11.80\r\n  ------------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\nThe first thing that will strike the reader on looking at these results\r\non Welsh materials, is their uniform composition as compared with the\r\nclays from Newcastle. Yet there is as much as 10.40 per cent. of iron\r\nin sample No. 1, which cannot be a first-rate clay. Its proportion of\r\nsilica to alumina is, however, excellent, and, as in sample No. 3, the\r\namount of soda and magnesia is not excessive. The soda in sample No.\r\n2 (which acts somewhat like lime in the kiln) taken together with the\r\nmagnesia and iron in the same material, is too much for a first-class\r\nclay, and would have to be suitably modified before good results could\r\nbe obtained. On the whole, it is possible that sample No. 3 would yield\r\nthe best results from the chemical standpoint.\r\n\r\nWe should not forget that remarkable substance of which the well-known\r\nDinas bricks are made. The proportion of silica present ranges from\r\nabout 96 to 99 per cent., the remainder consisting principally of\r\nalumina, though traces of iron, lime, and magnesia frequently occur.\r\nThere is not, of course, sufficient natural flux for this “clay,” so a\r\nsmall proportion (2.5 to 3 per cent.) of lime is added, which produces\r\nthe desired effect. In other words, if we can obtain a pure siliceous\r\nsand, with hardly any lime, iron or magnesia in it, we have the\r\nmaterial of which the better kinds of fire-bricks are made. Such sandy\r\nearths are not uncommon in the South of England, but strange to relate,\r\nthey are not used for the purpose indicated.\r\n\r\nThe earths from which the superior Stourbridge bricks are made, are\r\napproximately of the following chemical composition:--Silica, 64.10;\r\nalumina, 23.15; iron oxide, 1.85; magnesia, .95; water and loss, 10.00\r\nper cent. It will be observed that the proportion of iron and magnesia\r\nhere is very small, whilst lime is altogether absent. It is a most\r\nexcellent earth for the purposes for which it is used, and the chemical\r\nresults may be taken as a standard for that class of material. Another\r\nStourbridge earth yields as much as 4.14 per cent. of iron, however,\r\nwhilst its proportion of silica is lower, 51.80, and alumina higher,\r\n30.40, which serves to remind us of the variability of even good earths\r\nused in the manufacture of fire-clay goods.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the consideration of pottery clays, of which the\r\nfollowing results may be taken as typical:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chemical Composition of Pottery Clays._\r\n\r\n  ------------+-------+-------+--------\r\n              |   1   |   2   |   3\r\n              +-------+-------+--------\r\n  Silica      | 46.38 | 49.44 | 58.07\r\n  Alumina     | 38.04 | 34.26 | 27.38\r\n  Iron oxide  |  1.04 |  7.74 |  3.30\r\n  Lime        |  1.20 |  1.48 |   .50\r\n  Magnesia    | trace |  1.94 | trace\r\n  Water       | 13.57 |  5.14 | 10.30\r\n  ------------+-------+-------+--------\r\n\r\nSome of the chief qualifications, from a chemical point of view, of\r\nearths suitable for making pottery, is the proportion and potentiality\r\nof the colouring matters present. Where the pottery is to be glazed,\r\nthat is not so important; but with ordinary unglazed ware, colour\r\nand uniformity are two highly essential desiderata. We know that the\r\ntemperature employed will modify the tint, but under similar conditions\r\nthe clays alluded to in the above table will give, approximately, the\r\nfollowing results. Sample No. 1 is typical of an excellent blue pottery\r\nclay, which burns white. It contains more alumina than is commonly\r\nmet with in such materials, in which respect it differs markedly also\r\nfrom the fire-clays just described. The proportion of oxide of iron\r\nis very small, not sufficient to perceptibly colour the finished\r\nproduct, though, no doubt, on careful examination it would be seen\r\nnot to be perfectly white. The latitude of the term “white” is pretty\r\nconsiderable with clayworkers, as the reader is probably aware.\r\n\r\nThe pottery clay (also used for bricks) referred to in the middle\r\ncolumn, is brown in colour; it is an ordinary kind, used primarily\r\nfor black and common red ware. The proportion of iron is high, and\r\nconsiderable quantities of both lime and magnesia exist. As might\r\nnaturally be expected of such material, it will not bear exposure to\r\ngreat heat, though that might be regarded as a qualification in some\r\nbrick and pottery yards.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of silica is high in sample No. 3, which appertains to\r\na common yellow clay, with, possibly, some siliceous sand in it. The\r\namount of alumina is correspondingly low, but the iron oxide is not\r\nexcessive--for a common pottery clay. It is used for the manufacture of\r\ncoarse ware, and burns yellow.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of earths used for terra-cotta and bricks\r\nof that substance is so variable, that without going into each case\r\nspecifically it would be impossible to convey an adequate idea. It may\r\nbe stated generally that it is not one whit less important to consider\r\nthe composition of the raw earths for ordinary brickmaking, than in\r\nrespect of that for high-class bricks and pottery.\r\n\r\nAn excellent earth, from the neighbourhood of Ruabon, is of the\r\nfollowing composition:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chemical Composition of Ruabon Clay._\r\n\r\n  Silica               63.00\r\n  Alumina              20.10\r\n  Sesquioxide of iron   4.84\r\n  Protoxide of iron     1.51\r\n  Potash                2.37\r\n  Soda                  3.10\r\n  Combined water        3.54\r\n  Moisture              1.54\r\n\r\nThe proportion of silica in this is higher than in many clays used for\r\nbrick- or terra-cotta making, but the alkalis, potash and soda, are\r\nin strong force, so that any refractoriness on the part of the silica\r\nis soon subdued in the kiln. The iron, also, is in abundance. The\r\nprincipal colouring ingredient is the sesquioxide, and we can quite\r\nunderstand the manufacturer when he informs us that, in spite of the\r\nrich tint of the goods produced, nothing is artificially mixed with\r\nthis clay to produce such a result. We may call attention to the method\r\nof expressing the chemical analysis in this case, which might be copied\r\nto advantage. In the first place, the combined and the uncombined\r\niron are separately shown, or rather the degree of combination is\r\nindicated; and secondly, the proportion of water chemically combined\r\nis differentiated from that which has simply soaked into the clay,\r\nthough expelled, following a well-known practice of chemists, prior to\r\ncommencing the analysis proper. It is of very little use giving the\r\namount of water, unless the proportions are divided in this manner. In\r\nthe result given above we learn that there is very little chance of the\r\nclay shrinking, as it only contains moisture to the extent of 1.54 per\r\ncent.; but if that had been added to the water combined, we should have\r\nhad a result of 5.08 per cent., which is not nearly so clear in its\r\nmeaning. We may add that the Ruabon earth referred to is utilised also\r\nin the manufacture of tesselated and encaustic tiles.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the composition of earths employed in the manufacture of\r\nthe commoner kinds of bricks, we may give the following examples:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chemical Composition of Common Brick-earths._\r\n\r\n  -------------------+-------+-------+------+---------+----------+------\r\n                     |       |Alumina|      |         |          | Water\r\n                     |Silica.|  and  | Lime.|Magnesia.|Manganese.|  and\r\n                     |       | Iron. |      |         |          | Loss.\r\n                     +-------+-------+------+---------+----------+------\r\n  Reddish-brown      |       |       |      |         |          |\r\n      brick clay     |  52.6 |  30.8 |  3.4 |    2.8  |    1.4   |  9.0\r\n  Red-brick clay     |  50.4 |  24.0 |  2.7 |    1.3  |    ---   | 21.6\r\n  Common brick-earth |  33.0 |  11.2 | 39.8 |    6.0  |    ---   | 10.0\r\n  Sandy-clay (loam)  |  60.2 |  24.0 |  2.4 |    1.6  |    ---   | 11.8\r\n  -------------------+-------+-------+------+---------+----------+------\r\n\r\nReviewing these results, it will be noted that the brown colouring\r\nimparted to the brick in the first-mentioned example is due, to a\r\nlarge extent, to the presence of manganese, a rather uncommon feature\r\nin brick-earths, except where these have resulted from the denudation\r\nof iron-producing rocks rich in manganese. It will be noticed also\r\nthat the proportion of water is not high for a common earth, and it\r\nmust be a fairly easy material to deal with. There seem to be some\r\npossibilities in it that might, in competent hands, lead to higher\r\nthings. The amount of lime and magnesia is, however, a rather serious\r\none for a first-class clay.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the “red-brick” clay, an essential feature is the\r\ncomparative absence of lime, and it would, no doubt, make “rubbers”\r\nof an ordinary kind. Unfortunately, in the results given, the iron is\r\nnot separated from the alumina, but clearly the latter is very small\r\nin amount, and the results refer to a sandy material. The proportion\r\nof water is disastrous for the employment of this earth by unskilful\r\nhands. In drying, the greatest care would have to be exercised to\r\nprevent undue shrinking, and, in any case, the earth would have to be\r\nvery thoroughly incorporated to make a really serviceable brick. It\r\nis with earths of this character that the majority of brickmakers _in\r\nembryo_ come to grief; they know not how to handle them successfully,\r\nand twisting, warping, cracking, and “bursting” follow as a natural\r\nconsequence. It is a common and treacherous material, that could only\r\nbe made to succeed by perseverance and wide experience.\r\n\r\nThe “common brick-earth,” as will be seen, contains an abnormal\r\nquantity of lime, and doubtless refers to a marl, though not much\r\nalumina is shown. Malm bricks could be made from it, and the product\r\nwould have to be burned at a low temperature. For bricks useful to the\r\n“jerry-builder” this earth could be strongly recommended. It was, no\r\ndoubt, mainly derived from limestone rocks; and, judging from the high\r\nproportion of magnesia, probably from within a watershed composed to\r\nsome extent of magnesian limestone.\r\n\r\nThe “sandy-clay” or loam is of a very common type, and produces\r\nlight-red bricks. There is much in common between this and the\r\n“red-brick clay” previously referred to.\r\n\r\nThe practice resorted to in various parts of the world of making bricks\r\nfrom slate _débris_, although not hitherto adopted to any large extent\r\nin this country, merits some description in this place. Slates may be\r\nregarded as a highly compressed clay, the original structure of which\r\nhas been materially modified by the great pressure exerted during their\r\nmanufacture in Nature’s laboratory. To all intents and purposes they\r\nare silicates of alumina, _plus_ iron, lime, magnesia, and so on, and\r\nhave, practically, the same range of variation as have ordinary clays.\r\nBut during their manufacture, and subsequently, certain adventitious\r\nmineral matter has been frequently introduced, as may be gathered from\r\nthe following results:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chemical Composition of Slates._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n                           |   1   |   2   |   3   |   4\r\n                           +-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  Silica                   | 60.50 | 60.15 | 48.00 | 50.88\r\n  Alumina                  | 19.70 | 24.20 | 26.00 | 14.12\r\n  Iron (protoxide)         |  7.83 |  5.83 |  ---  |  9.96\r\n    „  (sesquioxide)       |  ---  |  1.82 |  ---  |  ---\r\n    „                      |  ---  |  ---  | 14.00 |  ---\r\n  Lime                     |  1.12 |  ---  |  4.00 |  8.72\r\n  Magnesia                 |  2.20 |  ---  |  8.00 |  8.67\r\n  Potash                   |  3.18 |  ---  |  ---  |   .88\r\n  Soda                     |  2.20 |  ---  |  ---  |  ---\r\n  Alkalis (not determined) |  ---  |  4.28 |  ---  |  ---\r\n  Carbon dioxide           |  ---  |  ---  |  ---  |  6.47\r\n  Water, &c.               |  3.30 |  3.72 |  ---  |  ---\r\n  -------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\n_Analysis No. 1_ refers to a blue Welsh roofing slate of Cambrian\r\nage. It is quite certain that the large proportion of alkalis present\r\nwould render this material unsuitable for brickmaking, except for the\r\ncommonest kinds of bricks. The iron, again, is very large in quantity,\r\nwhilst the amount of alumina is low. We could not recommend this slate\r\nfor good bricks under any consideration.\r\n\r\n_Analysis No. 2_ is of a dark-blue slate from Llangynog, in North\r\nWales. The amount of iron present is high, but from the low content\r\nof alkalis this material, under proper treatment, should make fairly\r\ngood bricks. The ferruginous constituent is too powerful, however, for\r\nfire-bricks to be made of this slate.\r\n\r\n_Analysis No. 3_, of a purple slate from Nantlle, shows a remarkable\r\ndiminution in silica and a corresponding increase in iron. Lime and\r\nmagnesia being present to such an enormous extent, taken in conjunction\r\nwith the iron, would render this slate absolutely useless for\r\nbrickmaking. There is not a redeeming feature about it.\r\n\r\n_Analysis No. 4_, which refers to a green Westmorland slate, has a low\r\npercentage of alumina and very large quantities of iron, lime, and\r\nmagnesia. Only bricks of an exceedingly inferior quality could result\r\nfrom such material.\r\n\r\nSumming up the general characteristics of these slates from the\r\nchemical aspect, one would say that none of them are very suitable for\r\nhigh-class bricks. No. 2 is the best. Several minor differences will\r\nbe observed between the results quoted and those referring to ordinary\r\nbrick-earths--in particular, the distribution of the alkalis. A general\r\nimpression is abroad that any purple slate will do for brickmaking, and\r\nmanufacturers do not yet seem to have realised that the chemical nature\r\nof slates is as variable as of brick-earths. That may account for the\r\ndifficulties experienced in many cases in turning out a satisfactory\r\nmaterial. The microscope is of much use in this connexion, however,\r\nand the practical effects of chemical analyses are not always as bad\r\nas they seem at first sight.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of this chapter will be devoted to the consideration of\r\nrarer kinds of brick-earth and other raw earths used principally in the\r\nmanufacture of bricks for special purposes, or as pointing to certain\r\nanomalies. As an example of what some manufacturers can do, we may\r\nquote the chemical composition of a peculiar brick-earth employed in\r\nZurich, in Switzerland:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chemical Composition of Brick-earth, Zurich._\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------+------\r\n                                   |Yellow| Blue\r\n                                   |Clay. | Clay.\r\n                                   +------+------\r\n  Carbonate of Lime                |23.68 |27.80\r\n      „      „ Magnesia            | --   | 5.7\r\n  Other carbon dioxide             | 2.85 | 1.55\r\n  Silica                           |42.39 |38.25\r\n  Alumina                          |18.16 |12.44\r\n  Iron oxide                       | 3.66 |  .73\r\n  Lime (as silicate)               |  --  | 1.85\r\n  Magnesia                         |  --  |  .15\r\n  Potash                           | 2.14 | 1.54\r\n  Soda                             | 1.27 | 3.05\r\n  Moisture (at 100° C.)            | 1.27 | 1.37\r\n  Water, &c., chemically combined  | 3.85 | 4.72\r\n  ---------------------------------+------+------\r\n\r\nHere we have two clays with the carbonates of lime and magnesia\r\npresent, in one case of over 35 per cent., and in the other of over\r\n26 per cent. Professor Lunge, of Zurich, states that the bricks made\r\nfrom them, if burned at the ordinary heat, say a moderate red heat, are\r\n_red_, and do not keep in the air, but crumble away very soon, as the\r\nquicklime slackens on combining with the moisture. When burned at a\r\nbright red heat, about 200° C. above the former, however, they become\r\nnearly white. The lime is then present as a ferri-alumina-calcic\r\nsilicate, which causes the red colour of the iron oxide to disappear,\r\nand, at the same time, entirely prevents any action of the moisture,\r\nquicklime being no longer present. We have no hesitation whatever in\r\nsaying that most British makers would look down upon raw earths such\r\nas these from Zurich, and yet many millions of really good bricks\r\nhave been made from them during the past twenty years, and they are\r\nespecially noted for their durability. The crux of the case is the\r\ntemperature at which the earths are burned, as the reader has perceived.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading of “magnesia,” we have said a few words regarding\r\nbasic bricks. In this country they have been made primarily from\r\nmagnesian limestone, the chemical composition of which is shown in the\r\nfollowing results of analyses:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chemical Composition of Magnesian Limestones._\r\n\r\n  ----------------------+------+-------+------+-------\r\n                        |   1  |   2   |   3  |   4\r\n  ----------------------+------+-------+------+-------\r\n  Silica                |  3.6 |  2.53 |   .8 |   --\r\n  Carbonate of lime     | 51.1 | 54.19 | 57.5 | 55.7\r\n      „     „  magnesia | 40.2 | 41.37 | 39.4 | 41.6\r\n  Iron, alumina         |  1.8 |   .30 |   .7 |   .4\r\n  Water, &c.            |  3.3 |  1.61 |  1.6 |  2.3\r\n  ----------------------+------+-------+------+-------\r\n\r\n_Analysis No. 1_ refers to the well-known magnesian limestone of\r\nBolsover.\r\n\r\n_Analysis No. 2_ to that from Huddlestone.\r\n\r\n_Analysis No. 3_ to that from Roach Abbey.\r\n\r\n_Analysis No. 4_ to that from Park Nook.\r\n\r\nThese results were obtained by Professors Daniell and Wheatstone in\r\nconnexion with an enquiry many years ago as to the kind of stone\r\nsuitable for the erection of the Houses of Parliament.\r\n\r\nRegarding them generally, it may be said that they are remarkable as\r\nnot containing much acid, practically the whole substance of the rocks\r\n(except No. 1) being made of the carbonates of lime and magnesia. In\r\nmanufacturing bricks of such materials as these, it will be seen that\r\nthe ordinary methods of brickmaking would not suffice. On heating\r\nmagnesian limestone, the carbonic acid is driven off, leaving the base\r\nbehind; it is estimated that the loss of the acid, _plus_ moisture\r\ndried out, leads to its reduction in weight of from 40 to 45 per cent.,\r\nand the shrinkage is from 25 to 35 per cent. If water were mixed with\r\nthis material, after calcination, strong chemical reactions would\r\nresult, and of such a nature as to render a coherent mass of the kind\r\nrequired for making bricks impossible. Seeing that water cannot be\r\nemployed, crude petroleum oil, coal oil, resin oil, &c., have been\r\nemployed, all of them with more or less satisfactory results. The\r\npetroleum, &c., is mixed with the lime, and when the whole is burned\r\nthe oil passes off, leaving bricks of solid lime. In manufacture it is\r\nhighly essential to see that the lime is well burned, and it must be\r\nfresh, and not have been exposed to a damp atmosphere. An improvement\r\nhas been effected by mixing from 5 to 7½ per cent. of burned clay,\r\nwhich makes the lime harder after burning. An admixture of from 3 to 5\r\nper cent. of iron oxide also consolidates the lime, though it increases\r\nshrinkage. The bricks are commonly made, in the first instance, under\r\nhydraulic pressure.\r\n\r\nThe diatomaceous earth known as Kieselguhr, which is used in the\r\nmanufacture of fire-bricks for chemical works and the like, and which,\r\nfor the most part, is of German origin, has the following chemical\r\ncomposition:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chemical Composition of Kieselguhr._\r\n\r\n  Silica           83.8\r\n  Lime               .8\r\n  Magnesia           .7\r\n  Alumina           1.0\r\n  Oxide of Iron     2.1\r\n  Organic matter    4.5\r\n  Water, &c.        7.1\r\n\r\nThe reader will perceive that this earth is composed very largely of\r\nsilica, though there is enough iron, &c., to flux it, at any rate,\r\nwithout material addition. The product is extremely light, and when\r\nproperly made, Kieselguhr bricks are the lightest known. They are\r\nusually of a light yellow tint, with iron spots. The silica is not in a\r\ncrystalline form, the bulk of the material being composed of the hard\r\nparts of microscopic plants known as diatoms; it is more like flint.\r\n\r\nAn earth of a similar character is found in the Isle of Skye, as\r\npreviously mentioned, though that burns into a redder colour.\r\n\r\nAn infusorial earth from Tuscany is composed of silica 55, magnesia 15,\r\nwater 14, alumina 12, lime 3, and iron 1 per cent. That also is made\r\ninto very light bricks. The general principle underlying the method\r\nof utilising those earths of organic origin is similar to that of the\r\nDinas bricks, though they do not always require artificial fluxing.\r\n\r\nAt Saarbrücken, in the Rhenish Province of Germany, a material known as\r\n“iron brick” is manufactured. It is made by mixing equal proportions of\r\nfinely-ground red clay-slate with fine clay, and adding 5 per cent. of\r\niron ore. This mixture is then treated with a 25 per cent. solution of\r\nsulphate of iron, together with a certain quantity of finely divided\r\niron ore. It is then moulded and baked in a special manner. We do not\r\nintend to describe the chemical composition of the various volcanic\r\nashes, trass, and other volcanic ejectamenta used for brickmaking on\r\nthe Continent in several localities. The materials of which glass-sand\r\nbricks, slag-bricks, &c., are made have no special interest in\r\nconnexion with our present subject, their composition naturally varying\r\naccording to the particular kinds of “refuse” employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nDRYING AND BURNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the merely mechanical aspects of the operations of drying and\r\nburning bricks, we shall say little or nothing. But there are just a\r\nfew points of a more or less scientific nature that offer themselves at\r\nthis juncture to which we desire to allude.\r\n\r\nThe brickmaker hardly needs to be told that if he places his bricks\r\nin the sun to dry, they, or a large percentage of them, will crack,\r\nand become practically worthless from a commercial standpoint. To dry\r\na brick properly in the open air is a lengthy operation--too lengthy\r\nfor many manufacturers, who, in consequence, have had recourse to\r\nartificial drying. Many a brickyard has had to be abandoned from the\r\ninability of the worker to produce bricks that did not crack at some\r\nperiod of the operation, either in the drying, or burning, or both. And\r\nseveral manufacturers have their particular methods of “doctoring” the\r\nraw earths to prevent cracking. These are invariably “trade secrets;”\r\nthough usually of a very open and transparent character, however, to\r\nthe student of the subject.\r\n\r\nIt is most curious to learn the different reasons for adding this or\r\nthat ingredient to the earths to prevent the brick from cracking. One\r\nwho in a district has found that the addition of a little sand is\r\nbeneficial, imparts that information by degrees, either personally or\r\nthrough his workmen, and in time it is laid down as a general axiom\r\nthat “sand will prevent cracking.” Another has discovered that clay\r\nshould be mixed in small quantity to produce the desired result, so\r\nhe and his neighbours do that, and pity the ignorance of the “sand\r\nmixers.” A third feels quite certain that crushed brick, or brick dust,\r\nis a good thing; while a fourth will add a little lime. Now, each of\r\nthese ingredients is useful in its way; everything depends upon the\r\nclass of brick-earth to be dealt with. It may happen that what will,\r\nin a measure, prevent cracking, will be a bad thing in the burning,\r\nand the art of the brickmaker is to know what to do under the varied\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, where care is exercised in the drying, the cracks\r\narise from the brick-earth being too wet or plastic in the first\r\nplace, and it cannot be too well understood that, _cæteris paribus_,\r\nthe wetter the earth the more liable it is to crack during drying. The\r\ncontraction, even when the unburnt brick is shielded, and in the open\r\nair, often proves too much for the material. Then we have that class of\r\nbrick-earth composed of too much clay, and that would be improved by\r\nthe addition of sand--just how much depends on the particular earth;\r\nand there is no better method of ascertaining the quantity required\r\nthan by subjecting the materials to direct practical experiment in\r\nthe kiln. Where no sand is available, it frequently happens that\r\nbrick-dust will answer the purpose, though this may be at the expense\r\nof homogeneity in the long run. In the semi-dry process of manufacture\r\nthe initial causes of cracking are not present, the block having to\r\ncontract so little that it may be taken from the press and stacked in\r\nthe kiln for burning. Unless the brick-earth be carefully prepared,\r\nhowever, the surfaces of the hard blocks produced by that process are\r\nliable to develop minute cracks. And here it may be stated that unless\r\nthe clay, with brick dust or other foreign substance, be thoroughly\r\nincorporated prior to being sent under the press, and the whole ground\r\nvery fine, it is impossible to prevent cracking during some part of the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nApart from the fierce and variable drying action of the open air, we\r\nhave a fruitful source of cracks in the indentations made by stamping\r\nthe makers’ name or trade-mark upon the blocks. With bricks burnt\r\nvery hard this does not so much matter, but on the commoner kind of\r\nmaterials one may often perceive minute, hair-like cracks radiating\r\nfrom the indentations. We presume that in this age of advertising it is\r\nimpossible to convince many makers of that fact, yet if full justice is\r\nto be done to the material, it will be better not to make any sharp or\r\ndeep marks on the brick.\r\n\r\nThe commoner kinds of brick-earth, as we have seen, mostly possess\r\ngross particles, grit, pebbles, &c.; these act as so many centres from\r\nwhich cracks radiate either during the drying or burning, and apart\r\nfrom their influence in a chemical sense, they are apt to seriously\r\nweaken the brick.\r\n\r\nIt is truly marvellous to see how little attention many large makers\r\npay to the initial drying; often the long rows of drying blocks are\r\nleft unprotected except for a rude kind of roof placed over them. The\r\npassing shower of rain drives in underneath, and wets the exposed\r\nsurfaces, causing the clay to swell. These surfaces, being moister than\r\nthe remaining portions of the brick, contract at a different rate,\r\nthe centre occasionally being drier than the outside. The unequal\r\ncontraction produces minute cracks even in most excellent earths.\r\n\r\nTurning to a smaller matter, the hand-barrow coming from the drying\r\nstacks to the kiln is unprotected, which often means that a good brick\r\nis spoilt. Of course, we are not alluding, in this connexion, to what\r\ntakes place during clamp stacking; the brick produced by such a process\r\nmust take its chance. The method of stacking in the kiln or clamp is\r\nvery often responsible for damage to the bricks. A common method is to\r\nbuild them sloping outwards, and all sorts of strains and stresses are\r\nthus set up, which have their effect in producing lines of weakness, if\r\nnot of actual visible cracks.\r\n\r\nThe “London stock,” if not a thing of beauty, is usually strong, and\r\nthat in spite of the “breeze” which forms so many points from whence\r\ncracks radiate. We must not forget, however, that a really good London\r\nstock is, above all things, thoroughly burnt, and that is a set-off\r\nagainst the numerous and often wide cracks.\r\n\r\nWe will assume that the brick has been either naturally or artificially\r\ndried, that no cracks have made their appearance, and that it is\r\nproperly stacked in the kiln ready for burning. Now comes a most\r\nimportant part of the process. It is possible that any microscopic\r\ncracks will be closed by fusion or agglutination; but it more\r\nfrequently happens that in unskilled hands the kiln is responsible for\r\nmany cracked and “starred” bricks. To know exactly how to introduce\r\nthe heat so gradually that the bricks shall not be impaired, is an art\r\nbegotten only of considerable experience. Even when dealing with one\r\nparticular kind of brick-earth, the maker must be careful to notice\r\nthe relative moistness of his charge, and vary the mode of procedure\r\naccordingly. Suppose the brick to be as “dry as a bone” before being\r\nput in the kiln, we shall notice a considerable amount of moisture\r\ncoming out of it as soon as the fires are alight; and if the heat\r\nis applied too suddenly, the bricks are not improved--they contract\r\nunevenly and too quickly, and warp. When well alight, care should\r\nbe taken to keep the temperature as uniform as possible, and when\r\nsufficiently burnt it must be lowered by almost imperceptible degrees.\r\nAbove all things, there should not be too great a disparity between\r\nthe temperature in the kiln and the outside air when unloading. Except\r\nto those who had minutely studied this matter, such a precaution might\r\nseem superfluous; it may be that no damage caused will be visible to\r\nthe naked eye, but the microscope frequently shows flaws due apparently\r\nto this cause. The manufacturer may test this for himself by heating\r\na good, sound medium burnt brick to the temperature usually found in\r\nhis kiln when unloading, and suddenly plunging it in snow. It is not,\r\nperhaps, that any one of these things is especially dangerous to the\r\nbrick, but it is the combined effect of all of them trending in the\r\nsame direction. We desire to be clearly understood on this point.\r\nThe cracks produced may not seriously impair the strength of the\r\nbrick; they may be merely superficial, and they mostly are. But they\r\nmaterially assist the agents of denudation in “scaling” the brick, and\r\nweathering it unevenly. To this we shall return later on.\r\n\r\nLet us now say something concerning the superficial changes produced in\r\nbricks by burning. The most important of all is the change of colour,\r\nupon which the sale of the brick depends in ninety-nine cases out of\r\na hundred. We said a few words on this subject when dealing with the\r\nbehaviour of individual minerals in the kiln. The production of an\r\nuniform tint is the main point aimed at; and it may be at once remarked\r\nthat unless the brick-earth employed is very homogeneous, or has been\r\nmost carefully prepared and thoroughly incorporated, the production of\r\nan uniform colour is impossible. In regard to the tint to be produced,\r\nit should be remembered that the temperature employed in burning is a\r\nmost potent factor. It is frequently laid down that such and such a\r\ntemperature will form a red brick, and another and higher temperature,\r\na blue one. That is a most absurd notion. In a general sense the\r\nprinciple could be correctly applied to a limited district, and with\r\none class of brick-earth; but it cannot be made to apply all round.\r\nThere is nothing like experience in regard to a point like this. In\r\na general way, of course, a pink, red, or blue tint may be produced\r\nfrom one brick-earth depending upon the temperature employed; but the\r\nbulk of brick-earths would melt and the whole kiln-full be ruined\r\nin any attempt to attain such a temperature as is used in burning a\r\nsound “Staffordshire blue.” Quite a large number of bricks made in the\r\nSouthern half of England, may be described as having been dried in\r\nthe kiln only--they cannot be said to be burnt, except that the heat\r\nemployed was enough to turn them red, or to make them piebald; the\r\nparticles are not agglutinated by fusion, and, indeed, there is often\r\nno trace of the constituents having been melted. On the other hand, we\r\nhave red bricks in which the constituents are distinctly agglutinated\r\nby fusion, and the whole burnt thoroughly. The brick-earth of which\r\nthese latter are made, would barely turn tint--would certainly not\r\nbecome red--at so low a temperature as that employed in producing the\r\nred in the non-agglutinated bricks alluded to.\r\n\r\nIt is not always an easy matter in burning a red brick to obtain two\r\nkilns full of the same tint, even in the same yard. When the employment\r\nof pyrometers becomes more general, that will be considerably\r\nsimplified; but it is a difficult matter to get a reliable instrument,\r\nnone of the forms hitherto invented being altogether suitable. That by\r\nProfessor Roberts-Austen is as good as any. Many manufacturers, we are\r\nsorry to say, place colour before everything else; they even sacrifice\r\ndurability to attain a certain tint. And there is much excuse for\r\nthem so long as they find a ready sale for the material. When colours\r\nare made from artificially introduced mineral matter (which is not so\r\noften the case as some appear to think) the mineral introduced is,\r\nmost commonly, iron; though it will be understood, from what we have\r\npreviously said, that it must be used very sparingly.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate tint assumed by the brick cannot always be judged\r\nbeforehand from the colour of the brick-earth. In brickmakers’\r\nlanguage, a red clay is one that produces a red brick, a blue clay\r\na blue brick, and so on. For the most part, colour depends on the\r\nproportion of hydrated oxide of iron in the clay; if iron is present\r\nin an earth that contains no lime, or similar mineral substance, the\r\ncolour produced in the brick at a moderate red heat will be red, and at\r\nthe same temperature, with the same brick-earth, the more iron present\r\nthe deeper the tint. In an ordinary brick-earth, when more than 10 per\r\ncent. of iron is present, the clay is apt to burn bluish, however, and,\r\nin certain cases, almost black. With a smaller proportion of iron, and\r\nthe application of intense heat, the same tint may result, and the\r\nbrick become vitrified. A brown colour may frequently be obtained when\r\nthe brick-earth has from 2.75 to 4 per cent. of magnesia, or a similar\r\nproportion may be artificially added to the earth.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a white brick, so that it shall also be of excellent quality,\r\nthe pure white clays of Devon and Cornwall are the best, though the\r\nso-called “white” is, in the majority of cases, a light cream colour,\r\nunless, of course, the brick is glazed. In the neighbourhood of\r\nLondon, a whitish brick results from a mixture of chalk (carbonate\r\nof lime) with clay or loam, and is known as a “malm.” In parts of\r\nYorkshire, white pressed bricks are manufactured from common red clay\r\nmixed with magnesian lime (made from magnesian limestone) in a slacked\r\ncondition. The latter ingredient, on introduction, immediately absorbs\r\nabout 40 per cent. of the moisture present in the clay.\r\n\r\nYellow bricks can easily be manufactured from the more impure kaolins;\r\nalso from certain clays in Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Kent, &c.\r\n(gault bricks); “malms” are mostly yellow, though called white.\r\n\r\nLaboratory experiments, many years old, show that with white clay as\r\na basis the following tints may be obtained. Phosphates of lime of\r\nvarious kinds = very light blue bricks. The phosphates, mixed with a\r\nquarter by weight of alum = brighter blue bricks. A mixture of white\r\nvitriol (sulphate of lime) three-quarters, with borax one-quarter =\r\nlight dirty green. Sulphur and tin oxide in equal proportions = yellow.\r\nThese experiments are interesting, but the ingredients would, as a\r\nrule, be too expensive for ordinary brick manufacture. They are more\r\napplicable for the production of ornamental tiles.\r\n\r\nA time-honoured method of producing black bricks is to make any\r\nordinary bricks red-hot and to dip them in a cauldron of boiling\r\ncoal-tar for a few seconds. It is essential that the brick should be\r\nvery hot, or the black staining will rub off. A good test that the\r\noperation has been successful is, that the surface shall be dull black,\r\nnot shining. And there are many other ways of obtaining different\r\ntints, the description of which would be beyond the scope of the\r\npresent work.\r\n\r\nUnless a brick is extremely well burnt it is not uniform in colour\r\nthroughout. A considerable proportion of a “draw” is often ruined in\r\nregard to tint by the adoption of an unsuitable form of kiln. Where\r\nthe brick is actually burned (as distinguished from being baked),\r\nthe contact of the flame from the fires is almost sure to lead to\r\nuncertainty in that respect along the flues. Impurities in the coal,\r\nsuch as iron pyrite, are the chief delinquents, and there is sure to be\r\na certain amount of “flash.” In that, as well as in the baking method,\r\nbricks are liable to be discoloured by the bringing out of impurities\r\nwhich they themselves contain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE DURABILITY OF BRICKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most important parts of our subject, and it may\r\nbe approached from several points of view. When a brick decays, its\r\nstructure, for the most part, is responsible therefor. A great deal\r\ndepends on whether the ingredients forming the brick are merely baked\r\nin the process of manufacture, or whether they are wholly or in part\r\nagglutinated by igneous fusion. A rough and ready plan of determining\r\nthis point, in the absence of experience, is by ascertaining the\r\nporosity of the brick. Other things being equal, the absorption test\r\nis undoubtedly the best all-round method of gauging the weathering\r\nqualities of a brick. But there are certain kinds of bricks which defy\r\nthat method; an imperfectly burnt one with a vitreous exterior is\r\nespecially treacherous in that respect, and, indeed all “vitrified”\r\nbricks are difficult to deal with by the “absorption process.” Again,\r\na brick cracked all over, not with superficial cracks only, but with\r\nthose which go far into the interior, will not yield its quality by\r\nmere immersion in water. The water, it is true, finds its way right\r\ninto the brick, but, as often as not, the sides of the cracks are\r\nperfectly vitrified and almost damp proof, so that on lifting the brick\r\nout of the water the latter rolls off as though it were on “a duck’s\r\nback.” Yet such a brick, yielding but the merest fraction as a result\r\nof the immersion, may be utterly worthless when put into a building,\r\nbecause it would not be strong enough.\r\n\r\nThen we have those bricks which are seriously affected chemically, but\r\nwhich seem fairly good in other respects. They also, in many cases,\r\ndefy the efforts of the experimenter in regard to absorption; though\r\nthey are nevertheless easily detected as being of bad quality, by\r\nother methods. Such bricks often resist great “crushing weights,” and\r\ngenerally bear a good character, their subsequent behaviour when put in\r\nthe building to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nIn determining the weather-resisting qualities of a brick we have the\r\nfollowing things to consider:--\r\n\r\n  1. The chemical composition of the brick.\r\n  2. Its absorptive capacity.\r\n  3. Its minute structure.\r\n  4. Its specific gravity.\r\n  5. Its strength.\r\n\r\nThe last-mentioned property can often be inferred from a knowledge of\r\nthe three preceding ones, and need not, therefore, form the subject\r\nof direct experiment. In spite of that, however, we find that the\r\n“crushing strength” is much more popular than the others. The reason,\r\nso far as brick manufacturers are concerned, is not far to seek.\r\nArchitects demand that especial quality. “What is the ‘crushing\r\nstrength’ of your bricks?” enquires the architect. And if the maker\r\ndoes not know, he stands a good chance of losing the order. Figures\r\nare demanded, and if the maker cannot produce a higher figure than his\r\nneighbour, woe betide him. But statistics are ever deceptive, and as\r\napplied to bricks in regard to their strength especially so.\r\n\r\nIn general, we have to consider whether the brick is strong enough\r\nfor the purpose to which it is to be applied; and that depends much\r\nmore on the manner in which it is built up, than on the strength of\r\nthe individual brick. For ordinary building purposes almost any\r\nkind of brick is, _per se_, strong enough, and a mere inspection of\r\nthe specimen suffices to carry conviction as to its suitability or\r\notherwise in that respect. For certain structures, such as buildings\r\nto carry heavy weights--especially moving weight--for engineering\r\npurposes, and the like, we ought, it is true, to know a little more.\r\nYet the engineer would be a very poor one who could not tell at sight\r\nwhether a brick submitted to him was fit or not for the purpose he has\r\nin view, from the point of view of its weight-carrying properties. In\r\nany case, however, fashion demands the “crushing weight” in figures,\r\nand although such figures are in general of but little practical value,\r\nthey must be given.\r\n\r\nThe principal difficulty the architect and engineer have to contend\r\nwith is not lack of strength, but the setting in of decay, and that\r\neven in bricks sometimes of the strongest description. Unless the\r\nstrength is going to be maintained, it is of no use whatever, in a\r\nscientific sense, to give it in the first instance.\r\n\r\nAfter these few preliminary observations, it will be well to treat the\r\nsubject more systematically.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT OF THE ATMOSPHERE ON BRICKS.\r\n\r\nAir is a mixture of gases; dry air consists of at least four of them,\r\nnamely, nitrogen, oxygen, carbonic acid, and argon. Of these, by far\r\nthe most abundant is nitrogen, present to the extent of about 78 per\r\ncent., then oxygen, 20.96 per cent., argon about 1 per cent., and\r\ncarbonic acid 0.04 per cent. Extremely minute quantities of ammonia and\r\nozone, though practically always present, have been omitted from the\r\npreceding results of analysis of air.\r\n\r\nWe have been speaking of pure dry air; but the atmosphere is hardly\r\never of precisely the same chemical composition in two different\r\nplaces. By the seaside it has more ozone, and chloride of sodium\r\nis found in particular abundance. In cities, especially where\r\nlarge factories exist, nitric acid and sulphuric acid appear most\r\nconspicuously, and the proportion of ammonia becomes larger. In the\r\nair of streets and houses, the proportion of oxygen diminishes, whilst\r\nthat of carbonic acid increases. Dr. Angus Smith has shown that very\r\npure air should contain not less than 20.99 per cent. of oxygen, with\r\n0.030 of carbonic acid; but he found impure air in Manchester to have\r\nonly 20.21 of oxygen, whilst the proportion of carbonic acid in that\r\ncity during fogs was ascertained to rise sometimes to 0.0679, and in\r\nthe pit of a theatre to the very large amount of 0.2734. Although these\r\nmay seem to be very small percentages, yet the total amount of carbonic\r\nacid in the atmosphere is enormous, and plays a conspicuous part in the\r\ndecay of certain kinds of bricks.\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid is found in the air of large cities principally as\r\na product of combustion, and is, of course, a distinct impurity. A\r\nportion of this acid is free, and a larger quantity is combined. Free\r\nsulphuric acid is very destructive to clay goods in the open; and it\r\nshould be remembered that the relative abundance of this impurity\r\ndepends on the precise _locale_ in the city. A great deal has been said\r\nand written about the decomposition of the stone of which the Houses of\r\nParliament are built. The air in the immediate vicinity must be highly\r\ncharged with both sulphuric and nitric acid from the proximity of the\r\nbusy factories on the opposite banks of the Thames in Lambeth. Had the\r\nHouses of Parliament been erected, say, in Kensington, where but few\r\nfactories exist, it is conceivable that the stone would have behaved\r\nmuch better.\r\n\r\nAir in itself, however, has no power to destroy bricks--the various\r\ngases, acids, chlorides, salts, solid carbon, inorganic and organic\r\ndust can do nothing by themselves. But the air is always laden with\r\nvapour, the most important of which is water vapour, which condenses\r\ninto rain, hail, snow, and dew. When rain is formed, the drops of water\r\ntake up minute quantities of air with its proportion of carbonic acid,\r\nsulphuric acid, or what not, and it is these acids, applied to the\r\nsurface of bricks through the medium of rain and moisture generally,\r\nthat are liable to do the damage if the nature and composition of the\r\nbrick are favourable.\r\n\r\nLet us assume that we have a brick composed of a goodly percentage of\r\ncarbonate of lime. The carbonic acid in the rain reduces this to a\r\nbi-carbonate, which is soluble in water, and hence the surface of the\r\nbrick decays, the rain water washing it away. Other things being equal,\r\nit follows that the same brick will decay most rapidly in a district\r\nwhere the rainfall is very great and where there is the largest\r\nproportion of these deleterious acids in the air.\r\n\r\nWhilst speaking of the various acids which attack and destroy bricks,\r\nwe must not forget those formed by the decomposition of organic matter\r\non the surface of bricks which “vegetate.” The lichens, mosses,\r\nand so forth, growing from cracks in the wall, or spread over on\r\nto the brick from the mortar, yield, on decomposition, some of the\r\nmost powerful acids in existence. A brick with a “crumbly” surface\r\naffords good foothold for these plants, and when they die they give\r\nrise to the so-called humus acids--crenic and apocrenic acid--which\r\nundoubtedly do an immense amount of damage. By keeping the surface\r\nof the brick moist, the plants permit the ordinary acids in rain to\r\ndo more execution than they otherwise would. Taking two bricks, one\r\nwhich “vegetates” and one that does not, and exposing them in the same\r\nsituation, it will be found that after a smart shower of rain the\r\nsurface of the former has become thoroughly soaked, and the vegetation\r\nkeeps it so, completely rotting it in time; whereas the surface of the\r\nlatter, exposed to the same shower, may be quite dry within an hour or\r\ntwo after the rain has fallen.\r\n\r\nReturning to the subject of rainfall, which exercises such material\r\ninfluence on the durability of bricks, we may give a few particulars\r\nconcerning the distribution of rain in this country. Speaking\r\ngenerally, the east coast of England is the driest part of the country,\r\nthe west coast having the greatest rainfall. The annual quantity at\r\nsea-level ranges from 60 to 80 inches on the west coasts of Ireland and\r\nScotland, to about 20 inches on the east coast of England.[10] In some\r\nlocalities, however, the fall is much greater, amounting to 154 inches\r\non the average of six years at Seathwaite, in Borrowdale, at the height\r\nof 422 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nThe quantities which fall in particular showers are often very great,\r\nand this aspect of rainfall also has its interest for us. About London\r\na fall exceeding an inch in 24 hours is comparatively rare, although\r\non August 1, 1846, 3.12 inches were collected in St. Paul’s Churchyard\r\nin two hours and seventeen minutes.[11] On our west coasts this amount\r\nis often exceeded. On October 24, 1849, 4.37 inches were collected at\r\nWastdale Head; June 30, 1881, 4.80 inches at Seathwaite; on April 13,\r\n1878, 4.6 inches fell at Haverstock Hill, London; and a fall of 5.36\r\ninches was recorded from Monmouthshire on the 14th July, 1875.\r\n\r\nTaking averages of districts, we may give the following statistics,\r\nreferring, of course, to annual rainfall:--\r\n\r\nLess than 25 inches = Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire,\r\nHuntingdonshire, Rutland, Middlesex, and parts of Surrey, Oxfordshire,\r\nBuckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire, Leicestershire,\r\nNottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, and Durham. In other words,\r\nwith the exception of parts of the North and East Ridings of Yorkshire\r\nand parts of Herts. and Bucks., which have a rainfall of from 25 to 30\r\ninches, the eastern half of England, to the east of a line drawn from\r\nSunderland to Reading, and then eastwards to the mouth of the Thames,\r\nhas only a rainfall of 25 inches, or slightly less, per annum.\r\n\r\nBetween 30 and 40 inches = Practically the whole of the south coast\r\nfrom Kent to Devonshire, the whole of Somerset, Wilts., and the west of\r\nEngland generally, with the exceptions about to be noticed.\r\n\r\nBetween 40 and 50 inches = A great part of Devon and Cornwall, the\r\nwestern half of Wales, with the exceptions presently to be given, a\r\ngreat part of Lancs., and Cumberland.\r\n\r\nBetween 50 and 75 inches = A small patch in the centre of Devon,\r\na large strip in West Wales, and an enormous tract of country in\r\nCumberland, Westmorland, with Lancs. and north-west Yorks.\r\n\r\nAbove 75 inches = The wettest parts of the country. A small part of\r\nDartmoor, a region in Wales in the vicinity and to the south-east of\r\nSnowdon, and the Lake District.\r\n\r\nWith reference to statistics concerning rainfall, it should be borne\r\nin mind that those relating to special districts, especially to hilly\r\nparts of the country, are often very deceptive, and require careful\r\nlocal study. A slight difference in the physical features of a locality\r\nis often sufficient to lead to considerable variation--the proximity\r\nof a conical hill rising from the plain, the sudden convergence of the\r\ntwo sides of a valley, or, conversely, the widening of a valley into a\r\nflat stretch of land, all materially affect the local distribution of\r\nrain. A clump of trees situated in proximity to a house will frequently\r\nbe the means of a downpour that would otherwise have passed over.\r\nWith winding valleys great latitude must be allowed. Then, again,\r\nthe geological structure of the locality is an important factor in\r\ndetermining the amount of moisture delivered at a given spot. Where we\r\nfind a thick clay cropping out in the bottom of a valley, with more\r\nor less porous rocks rising on either side of it, we soon ascertain\r\nthat the houses on the clay receive more moisture (or the latter is\r\ndistributed over a longer period) than those edifices on the hill sides\r\nin the same district.\r\n\r\nOur readers could no doubt give us plenty of instances where in a\r\ncircumscribed area their bricks have behaved very erratically--the\r\nbricks of a house in one part of the district weathering well, and\r\nin another badly. That may often be due, not only to the actual\r\ndistribution of the rain, but to the manner in which the rain or dew\r\nhas fallen. If an inch of rain falls in the neighbourhood in one day,\r\nthat would not tend to weather the bricks so vigorously as though the\r\nfall had been spread over, say, a week.\r\n\r\nA very important aspect of the subject is that which deals with the\r\n“efflorescence” on bricks. This appears to be greatly misunderstood,\r\nbeing commonly assumed to be due to one set of circumstances\r\nrather than to the conspiracy of several. There are many kinds of\r\nefflorescence, and an explanation of one of them obviously will not\r\napply to all. The “scum” that appears on the surface of bricks is,\r\nhowever, to some extent bound up in the composition of the rain in the\r\nparticular locality where it occurs. Examined attentively, the commoner\r\nkinds of efflorescence are seen to be minute white and yellowish-white\r\ncrystals. The substance of which these are formed has been drawn out\r\nof the brick, or the mortar, or both, and rain has been the principal\r\nagent in accomplishing this work, though its power in that respect must\r\nnecessarily vary according to the chemical composition and structure\r\nof the brick or mortar, as compared with the nature of impurities in\r\nthe rain. If some substance were present in the rain that could readily\r\nform an alliance with an ingredient of the brick, and the union was\r\ncapable of crystallising out, the surface of the brick would naturally\r\nform a convenient spot for the crystallisation to take place. To\r\nprevent it, we ought to know the composition of the air at the spot\r\nwhere the house is to be erected, and also the chemical and physical\r\nstructure of the brick to be employed. That is rather too much to\r\nexpect from the manufacturer and architect; but there is a method--we\r\nwill not say an infallible one--which may be adopted to get rid of that\r\nparticular kind of scum. That method could not always be adopted, as\r\nwill be seen. The bricks must be burned more thoroughly, and at a high\r\ntemperature; that would lead in most cases to the active employment of\r\npractically all the ingredients of which the bricks are composed, and\r\nthe impurities in the rain would, in consequence, stand less chance\r\nof successfully inducing some of them to break their allegiance.\r\nIn practice, however, we believe it would be found that the high\r\ntemperature requisite to bring about the result just stated would\r\neither tend to spoil the colour of the brick or partially melt it. The\r\nlatter could be prevented with due care, but we are afraid the former\r\ncould not be so easily dealt with, with the majority of brick-earths.\r\nAnd if the brick is to be permanently discoloured to prevent\r\nefflorescence, it is better to permit the latter to manifest itself.\r\nThe life of the “scum” is very variable; sometimes, after having once\r\nappeared and disappeared, it will never come again. The passing shower\r\nmay wash it off (though it is not always so easily removed), and it may\r\ncome again and again for years. It behaves very erratically. The amount\r\nof the efflorescence may be such as, in course of time, to lead to the\r\nsurface of the brick “bursting” and peeling off, or, on the other hand,\r\nit may be a mere film.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing in connexion with efflorescence which cannot be\r\noverlooked in regarding its practical effects in the building. In ever\r\nso many cases we find that the scum, or the major part of it, is only\r\nto be found in the neighbourhood of the mortar joints. That is a matter\r\nof direct observation, and we have taken some considerable trouble to\r\nverify it, as it has always been regarded as a point whereon to hinge\r\na debate. We do not say that in all cases the efflorescence appears\r\nonly in the position on the brick just indicated; but it unquestionably\r\ndoes so in too many instances to enable us to regard its occurrence as\r\nmere accident. Taking a large surface of brickwork just commencing to\r\nshow efflorescence, we find that the vicinity of the mortar joints are\r\nthe first places, in very many instances, where the nuisance begins to\r\nmanifest itself. From thence it spreads over the surface of the brick\r\nuntil the whole is more or less discoloured.\r\n\r\nIt seems impossible to deny that the mortar is guilty, to some extent,\r\nin such cases. At the same time, we must confess that we have never\r\nseen the efflorescence spreading over the mortar. It would appear that\r\nsomething in the mortar enters into chemical alliance with certain\r\ningredients of the brick, and that neither without the other could\r\nproduce the phenomenon alluded to. The remedy suggesting itself most\r\nreadily is to chemically analyse the efflorescence, the brick, and the\r\nmortar; supplementing the experiments with a micro-examination to see\r\nhow far it is possible to locate the deleterious substances found to\r\nexist, so that they may be removed in the manufacture of the materials,\r\nif that is possible. But information on that head is of the scantiest\r\ndescription, and much more will have to be done before the question is\r\ndefinitely settled.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of “efflorescence” that often appears on bricks in\r\ndamp situations is mere vegetable growth, which bears a superficial\r\nresemblance to the crystalline “scum” just described, though it can,\r\nof course, be easily differentiated on examination with a lens. The\r\ndamp atmosphere is no doubt largely responsible for this, though\r\nineffectual damp-courses are contributors. The remedy lies in having a\r\nless absorbent brick--one that will not afford ready foothold to the\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nThe influence of rain on the weathering of bricks may be considered\r\nfrom yet another standpoint. Where the brick is fairly porous, its\r\ndurability is liable to be materially influenced through the agency\r\nof successive frosts. The water finds its way a short distance into\r\nthe brick and saturates it. During frost the water is turned into ice\r\nat and near the surface of the brick. In forming, the ice exerts\r\nconsiderable expansive force, which forces asunder the particles\r\n(sand-grains and the like) of which the brick is composed--that is\r\nto say, near the surface of the brick. The accumulated effects of\r\nsuccessive frosts in this way tends to weather the brick by breaking\r\nup its exposed surfaces. To be materially affected, however, the brick\r\nwould have to be of very poor quality, and it will be seen that the\r\npresence of cracks would much facilitate the operation.\r\n\r\nThe style of a building, the manner of its construction, and especially\r\nthe class of metals used for exterior decoration, all assist rain in\r\nits work. A projecting course will have its upper surface washed clean,\r\nwhilst the underside remains very dirty--in cities, becoming quite\r\nblack. The limit of this dark discolouration is often frayed out by\r\nthe irregular action of the rain dripping from the projecting ledge,\r\nassisted by the wind. Where the projection is so designed that the\r\nrain is induced to drain to one point, and then to fall over on to the\r\nwall, an unsightly streak down the latter is the result. The free use\r\nof metal ornaments, railings, for supporting signs, for down-pipes,\r\n&c., is unfortunate in not a few instances. At the point of junction\r\nbetween the metallic substance and the brick into which it is inserted,\r\nor in the immediate neighbourhood above which it is fastened, the\r\nbrickwork is sure to be discoloured. This may arise from the dripping\r\nof rain-water from the metal, or it may be from the decomposition of\r\nthe latter, or from both. Iron rust leads to brown streaks, zinc-compo.\r\nto dirty red, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe action of the wind as affecting the durability of bricks is\r\nsufficiently important to warrant passing allusion. It drives rain and\r\nits deleterious acids farther into the brick than the moisture would\r\nsoak in the ordinary way. It leads to wet walls interiorly, unless the\r\nlatter are so constructed as to overcome the effects. On the other\r\nhand, a gentle breeze dries moisture on the face of the brickwork. In\r\ncities, wind indirectly assists rain and its impurities by blowing\r\norganic matter from the streets into niches and corners, where it\r\nlodges, and, decomposing, provides powerful acids capable of doing much\r\nwork. Discolouration is the chief effect produced on the average brick\r\nthrough this medium. In certain countries, wind, by driving dust, sand,\r\n&c., acts as a species of sand blast.\r\n\r\nConsiderable diurnal variations in temperature are known to be\r\npeculiarly destructive to certain kinds of brick and terra-cotta work.\r\nVery porous bricks are not much affected, but the more compact kinds,\r\nand especially terra-cotta blocks, often suffer. These observations\r\ndo not so much apply to our own country as to warmer climates; though\r\nwe are not altogether without experience here. On being heated these\r\nmaterials expand; when made loosely, as in rubbers and the like, the\r\neffect of the expansion is not very manifest, because the motion\r\nis absorbed, so to speak, by the brick itself. On the other hand,\r\nincreased compactness of the particles leads to a perceptible increase\r\nin the size of the bricks, and when the sun has gone down contraction\r\ntakes place as the bricks are cooling. It often happens in hot climates\r\nthat the brick or terra-cotta block is unable to part with its heat as\r\nrapidly as the surrounding air becomes cooler, although it tries hard\r\nto do so, and this leads to corners of the brick being broken off, the\r\nphysical forces exerted during the struggle doing the damage.\r\n\r\nA highly interesting case of the effects of temperature on terra-cotta\r\nwas detailed by Mr. T. Mellard Reade, C.E., F.G.S., a few years\r\nago.[12] He shews that the cumulative effect of small, but repeated\r\nchanges of temperature is very striking, and describes the lengthening\r\nof a terra-cotta coping in that connexion. The coping in question,\r\nwhich was freely exposed to the direct rays of the sun, consisted of\r\ntwo courses of red Ruabon terra-cotta bricks set in cement upon a\r\nfence wall, built with common bricks in mortar, a brick and a half\r\nin thickness. The courses were level, but, in consequence of the\r\ninclination of the road, the coping stepped down at intervals, so that\r\nthe undercourse of bricks of one length was just gripped and held in\r\nposition by the top course of the next length of coping. It will be\r\nobserved that that form of construction constituted, by liability\r\nto lifting, a more delicate test than ordinarily of any increase of\r\nlength, that might take place in the coping. On subsequent examination\r\nof the coping, the end position of one length, abutting against the\r\nnext length at the drop in the level, was found to be thrown up into an\r\narch-shape bend of about 6 feet span; the coping bricks being lifted\r\nin the highest part one inch from their bed. There was a fracture at\r\nthe crown of the arch, and another at the foot or springing, but for\r\na distance of 30 feet the coping was practically one solid continuous\r\nbar. A careful examination shewed that the coping had “grown” about a\r\nquarter of an inch longer than when it was first set, and that this\r\nlengthening, as shewn by movement on the corbel bricks which occur at\r\nintervals, was evenly distributed along a length of 30 feet.\r\n\r\nMr. Mellard Reade tells us that this is by no means an isolated case.\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Blundellsands inspection of brick copings\r\nshewed that it was quite a common feature, and he has noted several\r\ninstances in which the end brickwork and piers have been badly\r\nfractured by the force of expansion. In a case where the coping was\r\nof blue Staffordshire bricks, the top course in cement and the under\r\ncourse in mortar, a change in length was clearly shewn by the coping\r\nbeing lifted off the wall at each of the two ramps which exist in its\r\nlength, and the movement was readily measured on the corbel bricks as\r\nin the case previously detailed. In this case the lengthening was also\r\na quarter of an inch, and was evenly distributed over a considerable\r\nlength of coping.\r\n\r\nWhilst speaking of changes of temperature in their effect on bricks, we\r\nmay allude to the behaviour of the material in severe conflagrations.\r\nA general rule cannot be laid down, because it is customary now-a-days\r\nto use fire-bricks for ordinary building purposes which will withstand\r\npractically any heat to which they may be subjected. Leaving them out\r\nof the question, and referring to ordinary bricks, it may be said\r\nthat those of an inferior class frequently become cracked all over\r\nduring a fire, or, it may be, by the sudden cooling after the fire has\r\nbeen put out, or by the sudden lowering of the temperature in them\r\nby the continuous action of the fireman’s hose. All the same, the\r\naverage brick withstands heat far better than any kind of granite, or\r\nsimilar igneous holo-crystalline rock; loosely compacted sandstones\r\nand limestones crumble up on the surface, or flake, or may be utterly\r\ndestroyed when subjected to a conflagration that would not have the\r\nslightest effect on bricks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE MICRO-STRUCTURE OF BRICKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader may be tempted to enquire, What is the use of knowing the\r\nmicro-structure of a brick? We have anticipated the question to some\r\nextent in dealing with the structure of brick-earths, but it may be\r\nwell to enlarge upon it here. In the first place, the study of the\r\nminute structure enables the manufacturer to ascertain whether the\r\nbrick is thoroughly and homogeneously burnt. It tells him whether the\r\nmaterials mixed together in the earlier stages of manufacture were\r\nthoroughly incorporated or not, whereby, if need be, he can improve\r\nthat part of the process. In carefully examining what the average\r\nmanufacturer would call a well-burnt brick, the microscope assists us\r\nin perceiving that it is often anything but well burnt, small local\r\npatches--“tears”--of semi-vitrified matter being observed, which\r\nshould not exist, of course, in a perfectly homogeneous brick. And if\r\nthe brick is not homogeneous, it suffers in respect of its strength\r\nas a whole, and in the majority of cases its colour is not uniform.\r\nTo arrive at the cause of this lack of uniformity is to indicate the\r\nmanner in which the manufacture of the brick may be improved, and the\r\nmicroscope often enables us to arrive at a satisfactory solution of the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nFrom a chemical standpoint we know that a high percentage of iron in\r\nthe average brick-earth is not conducive to the production of a good\r\nbrick. In the same manner by “rule of thumb” we learn that a high\r\npercentage of lime prevents the manufacture of the raw material into\r\na fire-brick, unless, indeed, we are making basic bricks. The chemist\r\ntells us also of the respective values of potash and soda. Too much\r\niron will cause the brick to “run”; salt has a similar effect; but\r\nbeyond this the chemist cannot go, except that in the broad sense he\r\nexplains what unions take place to produce such results.\r\n\r\nThe microscope, on the other hand, enables one to see exactly what\r\nhas taken place; the deleterious constituents are detected at their\r\nwork, and careful chemical investigation teaches us what to add to the\r\nbrick-earth to neutralise the effects observed; for it is only from\r\nits effects that the artificial constitution of the brick-earth can be\r\nproperly regulated.\r\n\r\nThe same instrument is extremely useful in all questions concerning\r\nthe relations subsisting between a brick and the glaze upon it, the\r\ncause and prevention of the cracking of the latter, and its general\r\nquality from a physical aspect. And, speaking of cracks, we may\r\nagain draw attention to the influence these have on the strength and\r\ndurability of the brick: many of these minute fissures cannot be seen\r\nby the naked eye. In a similar way can the microscope be made use of\r\nin the manufacture of terra-cotta and faïence. The cracking of glazes\r\nis one of the most troublesome features the high-class brick and\r\ntile manufacturer has to deal with. If the character of the surface\r\nof the brick is not suitable for “taking” the glaze, the maker knows\r\nin a moment; the trouble is where the glaze takes readily and then,\r\nsome time after the operation is finished, it becomes covered with\r\n“spider-web” cracks, unsightly and considerably detracting from the\r\nvalue of the brick. The cause of the cracking is commonly attributed\r\nto the composition of the glaze, and the manner in which the latter is\r\nallowed to cool, and no doubt a great deal is due on both those heads.\r\nAt the same time, we know of many instances where the same glaze being\r\nused under similar conditions on two different surfaces of bricks made\r\nfrom one and the same brick-earth, the glaze cracks in the one case,\r\nand hardly ever in the other. The direction of the cracks points to\r\ntheir origin, and the character of the surface is brought in guilty.\r\nAnd yet the average manufacturer would not detect any difference in the\r\nquality of the surface--he could not, without a good lens or low power\r\nobjective, perceive the slightest discrepancy.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary glaze behaves very much like Canada balsam with\r\nreference to surfaces on which it is laid, and something akin to what\r\npetrologists call “perlitic” cracks is produced in the glaze. We can\r\nmake these cracks, and imitate the structure artificially, by suitably\r\ndistributing the Canada balsam over the surface of a piece of ground\r\nglass, and in other ways. That direct relationship exists between\r\nthe cracks and the grain of the surface on which the preparation is\r\nlaid, is certain, for we may vary the distribution of the cracks by\r\nvarying the grain of the surface. An intelligent appreciation of the\r\ndisposition of cracks in glazes should be the means of preventing them\r\naltogether, and not only with bricks, but with faïence and vitrified\r\nwork generally, the study may be best carried on by aid of the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nThe microscope, also, may be made use of in identifying bricks in\r\ncase of dispute, though its applications in this respect are not so\r\nimportant as in dealing with building stones.\r\n\r\nQuestions of durability may frequently be decided on appeal to that\r\ninstrument. Take a case in which a brick is known to contain a rather\r\nhigh percentage of lime: if the lime were in a combined state, the\r\nquality of the brick would not be materially affected; but assuming\r\nit were not so employed, it is possible that in a short space of time\r\nthe brick would be thoroughly decomposed by atmospheric agencies. The\r\nmicroscope tells us at a glance the state in which that and other\r\ningredients exist, in a well-burnt brick. We draw the line at bricks\r\nintended for the “jerry” builder; they may well be left to take care of\r\nthemselves; we allude only to high-class productions in which science\r\nmay be some aid to the manufacturer.\r\n\r\nAnd now as to the microscope--for we do not use an ordinary one in\r\nsuch investigations. The best kinds of microscope are those used\r\nby petrologists in the study of the minute structure of rocks and\r\nminerals. The reader will find these fully described in works specially\r\ndevoted to the subject,[13] but we may say a few words thereon.\r\n\r\nA common form of “Student’s” petrological microscope, as manufactured\r\nby Swift of London, may be described as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Eye Pieces and Objectives._--These need not be expensive, clear\r\ndefinition being the principal object to aim at; the objectives should\r\nbe of low power, 2-inch, 1-inch and ½-inch objectives being plenty\r\nfor the purpose. Unless the reader desires to follow the subject\r\nfrom a purely petrological point of view, to study the development of\r\ntrichites, globulites, skeleton crystals, etc., in vitrified bricks,\r\nin such places as these latter have cooled from igneous fusion,\r\nthere is no occasion to resort to higher powers. We are far from\r\nsaying that the brickmaker of the present day would not derive any\r\nadvantage from studying this subject in its higher aspects, for the\r\norigin of crystallization appeals strongly to the imaginative mind,\r\nand is one of the most remarkable problems that Nature offers for our\r\ninvestigation. But in an elementary treatise of this kind we cannot go\r\ninto the matter; and, as previously remarked, low power objectives are\r\nsufficient for our present purpose. The eye-pieces should be fitted\r\nwith cross-wires, the use of which will presently be explained.\r\n\r\n_The Stage._--In the instrument we are now describing this is\r\ncircular with a hole in the middle, and is so arranged as to revolve\r\nhorizontally on a collar about an axis, the centre of which comes\r\nexactly underneath the centre of the objective. In other words, a\r\nstraight line drawn through the eye-piece down the centre of the barrel\r\nof the microscope, and passing through the objective passes through\r\nthat axis. To assist in more accurately centreing than is otherwise\r\npossible (depending on the lenses) with this cheap form of instrument,\r\na collar with adjustable screws is ordinarily affixed to the lower\r\npart of the barrel of the microscope. The stage, with suitable clips\r\nto hold the object to be examined, is graduated so that on its being\r\nrevolved it is easy to ascertain the number of degrees, at any period\r\nof the revolution, through which it has been turned. Thus, it will be\r\nobserved that the object revolves with the stage. A pointer is placed\r\nin a suitable position on the frame of the microscope to facilitate the\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n_The Polariscope._--This is an indispensable adjunct, for determinative\r\npurposes it is often necessary to observe the object in polarised\r\nlight. Briefly, the polariscope consists of two parts--the analyser,\r\nplaced in the barrel of the microscope above the objective, and the\r\npolariser, arranged underneath the revolving stage. The analyser is so\r\nfitted that it may be shot in and out of the barrel in order that the\r\npolariser alone may be used, or the latter may be removed, leaving only\r\nthe analyser in position, or both may be removed to enable the object\r\nto be examined in ordinary light, either reflected or transmitted. The\r\nlower nicol[14] is made to revolve, and the collar in which it is fixed\r\nis broadly graduated and furnished with a pointer.\r\n\r\n_Reflector._--An ordinary reversible and adjustable reflector is\r\narranged beneath all.\r\n\r\n_Accessories._--For the more accurate determination of minerals, a\r\nquartz wedge, a quartz plate, etc., are used by the petrologist, but\r\nthe description of these is beyond the scope of the present work.\r\nFor examination in reflected light it is highly desirable to have a\r\n“bull’s-eye” condenser.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary microscope with a revolving stage may be readily converted\r\nto petrological purposes, though it is better to have a special\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe object to be examined may be in the form of (_a_) a fragment of the\r\nbrick, or (_b_) a very thin slice of the same.\r\n\r\nThe fragment may be securely clipped and held in position on the\r\nstage, the “bull’s-eye” condenser being brought into use to throw\r\na strong light on the part immediately under the objective. The\r\npolarising apparatus is no use for this, and may be thrown out of\r\ngear. A very low power should be employed. The observation may be\r\ndirected towards ascertaining how far the fragments composing the\r\nbrick are agglutinated, and their size may be noted. Anything like a\r\ndiscolouration should be specially observed, and a minute description\r\njotted down. In bricks that have not been burnt very hard, and in\r\nthose that have merely been baked, we shall often be able to detect\r\nparticles of mineral matter which further investigation, after the\r\nmanner presently to be described, shows are opaque. Different forms\r\nof iron, iron pyrite, fragments of clay that have merely been dried\r\nin the process of baking, and minute pieces of chalk (now converted\r\ninto lime) are amongst the most prominent opaque substances met with\r\nin common bricks. These may generally be differentiated and determined\r\nat sight, and bricks thus composed are never of good quality, though\r\nthe ingredients have been ground very fine, and there may be nothing\r\nsuperficially to find fault with. Their bad qualities are usually\r\nbrought out in the weathering. A great deal may, therefore, be learned\r\nfrom a careful examination of fragments in this manner.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the examination of very thin slices, that is in the\r\nmajority of instances the most instructive, and, if we may say so, the\r\nmost interesting method of investigation, though it must always go hand\r\nin hand with the other. The slice of the brick is so thin that the\r\nbulk of the constituents is rendered transparent, or semi-transparent.\r\nThe preparation of such slices[15] is not difficult, but demands\r\nsome experience; those who have neither the time nor patience to\r\nmake them will find it convenient to send the fragments of brick to\r\nDamon, of Weymouth, or some other first-class dealer in geological\r\nand mineralogical specimens. The price charged, per slide, is usually\r\n1s. 6d. At the same time, the student will find it eminently to his\r\nadvantage to prepare the slices himself. In the process he will learn\r\nmuch that escapes attention when the work is done by another.\r\n\r\nThe thin slice mounted on a slip of glass is placed on the stage of\r\nthe microscope and firmly clipped, as with the fragment. The reflector\r\nis brought into position, and a beam of light thrown through the\r\nslice--the thin section is now being examined in transmitted light. At\r\nfirst it will be convenient to study it with the polariser and analyser\r\nthrown out of position. A certain proportion of the constituents is\r\nfound to be opaque, and should be examined in reflected light, as\r\nabove described. The remainder are more or less transparent, and some\r\nof the grains will, possibly, be coloured. We notice the way in which\r\nthe whole of the fragments are bound together--say, by some opaque\r\nmineral such as iron--or whether they seem to be partially or wholly\r\nfused together. In the case of a vitrified brick, the latter phenomenon\r\nis most usual, and we shall find that although crystalline fragments\r\nhave been melted, or partially fused, there is commonly a centre or\r\nnucleus of each fragment in its original condition remaining, which\r\npasses through insensible gradations from the crystalline to the\r\nnon-crystalline, or amorphous state. This latter circumstance may\r\nbe ascertained by using the polariscope. Ignoring the opaque matter\r\nadverted to, we shall then see that what was transparent in ordinary\r\nlight appears, for the most part, to be opaque in polarised light.\r\nThose portions which still let the light through are truly crystalline,\r\nand by revolving the stage we notice that they frequently change\r\ntint, becoming alternately light and dark. In that brick where the\r\nparticles are agglutinated by igneous fusion, we shall observe the\r\nlight decreasing in intensity from the crystalline portion (forming the\r\nnucleus, as it were, of each particle) outwards, and where the crystal\r\nfragment has been melted, so as to become fused to its neighbour, the\r\nperiphery, or rather what was originally the boundary of the fragment,\r\nis quite dark. Polarised light cannot pass through non-crystalline\r\nmatter, and in being melted that portion of the crystal fragment\r\nhad passed from the crystalline to the non-crystalline stage. It is\r\nvery easy, therefore, to determine how far the fragments composing\r\na vitrified brick have been melted down and fused together; but to\r\nobserve the phenomena under the most favourable conditions, the brick\r\nmust be thoroughly well-burnt, and the section taken, by preference,\r\nfrom near the outside surface of the brick.\r\n\r\nIn some instances, partial fusion is so well exemplified (especially\r\nin bricks from fairly pure china clay), and the brick, after being\r\nburnt, has been permitted to cool so slowly, that devitrification\r\nhas set in, when we are presented with aggregates of crystallites\r\nclosely resembling the “felspathic matter” of petrologists. That is\r\na circumstance which the maker should note well, for he has burnt\r\nthe brick to the best advantage, and it is not then so brittle as it\r\nmight have been had more “glass” made its appearance in the section.\r\nProlonged heat, just above the agglutinating point, has accomplished\r\nthis, and the microscope here clearly shows the advantage of allowing\r\nthe kiln to cool slowly, and to permit the lapse of several days in the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE MICRO-STRUCTURE OF BRICKS (_Continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning now to the actual appearance of minerals commonly found in\r\nbricks as they are examined under the microscope, we may remind the\r\nreader, that the physical aspect of the majority of them has already\r\nbeen described in those chapters dealing with the “Mineral Constitution\r\nof Brick Earths” and “Minerals: their behaviour in the Kiln,” and the\r\nparticulars that follow may be read in conjunction with what was there\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient now to describe the appearance of certain\r\nwell-known minerals, as they are seen (A) in reflected light and (B)\r\nin thin sections in transmitted light, whilst the latter will be\r\nsubdivided into _1_ denoting the phenomena observed in ordinary light,\r\nand _2_ in polarised light. To save repetition, the letters and figures\r\nwill be used to denote the methods of examination as indicated.\r\n\r\nQUARTZ.--Present in nearly all rubber-bricks, and in the vast majority\r\nof common stocks, as well as in vitrified goods and fire-bricks. In the\r\nlast mentioned, the grains are usually partially agglutinated, and are\r\nextremely minute.\r\n\r\nA. As more or less rounded, or sub-angular fragments, white and\r\ncrystalline, like clear window glass.\r\n\r\nB. 1--Clear white, often broken up by thin hair-like lines running\r\nin various directions, and rows and patches of minute specks, which,\r\nas previously remarked, have been shown to contain fluid, &c. 2--On\r\nrevolving the stage of the microscope, the crystals are usually\r\nseen to present beautiful, clear transparent colours, which in\r\ncharacteristic sections are very vivid--red, blue, yellow, &c.\r\n\r\nFLINT.--Found in the same class of bricks as quartz.\r\n\r\nA. Bluish horn colour; irregular fragments and splinters.\r\n\r\nB. 1--Translucent; often melted more thoroughly than quartz in hard\r\nburnt bricks; colourless. 2--Opaque unless in some such form as\r\nchalcedony, when an extremely minute granular aspect results, becoming\r\nslightly transparent. Melted portions always opaque.\r\n\r\nFELSPAR.--The alteration which the different kinds of felspar have\r\nundergone in a hard burnt brick, when present, render it almost\r\nimpossible to recognise them specifically.\r\n\r\nA. Milk white, or more rarely light pink; the mineral, even when red in\r\nthe raw earths, becomes white on the application of moderate heat, as\r\nin the burning of common bricks. It is often closely fractured, and but\r\nrarely powdered.\r\n\r\nB. The characteristic parallel lines of the triclinic varieties may\r\noften be observed, especially in rubber bricks; but great heat, such\r\nas leads to partial peripheral fusion, frequently obliterates them\r\nto a large extent, and in a well-burnt brick it is quite impossible\r\nin the majority of cases to determine whether the felspars present\r\nare triclinic or monoclinic. More particularly is this the case when\r\nthe mineral has been more or less decomposed prior to its having been\r\nburnt. The bulk of the fragments of the mineral can only be alluded to\r\nin the general term “felspars,” and in ordinary light these are opaque\r\nor “fleecy,” whilst in polarised light minute portions may be found to\r\nbe slightly birefringent. In a decomposed state it forms a prominent\r\nconstituent of brick-earths in the first place, and that is precisely\r\nthe material which most readily agglutinates in presence of a suitable\r\nflux. Crystallites are not uncommon in the melted peripheries, as may\r\nbe seen in a hard-burnt brick in ordinary light.\r\n\r\nMICA.--In minute flakes, shining, or glistening, and commonly black,\r\nsilvery or bronze-coloured.\r\n\r\nA. Detected at once by its thin shining scales, which frequently have\r\nnot suffered much in the kiln except near the outside of the brick.\r\n\r\nB. 1--The darker micas are usually citron coloured or light brown,\r\nand unless cut parallel to the cleavage of the mineral, exhibit a\r\nnumber of closely-set parallel lines, the fragments being much “frayed\r\nout” and “ragged” at the edges. 2--Using one nicol only, the mineral\r\nchanges from dark to light on the revolution of the stage, and is said\r\n(in common with other minerals exhibiting a similar property) to be\r\ndichroic. With both nicols in position but little further difference is\r\nnoted, except that in changing tint the whole is darker. Vivid colours\r\nare not observed except in yellows and browns. Muscovite mica is often\r\nquite white and transparent.\r\n\r\nIRON.--Common except in white bricks made from the purest china-clays.\r\n\r\nA. Brown or reddish-brown specks; sometimes as blue black films in\r\nfire-bricks; dull and frequently powdery in common bricks. Surrounding,\r\nfilm-like, grains of mineral matter of which the brick is composed.\r\nA grain of quartz, for instance, is frequently seen enveloped by a\r\nfilm of red iron. Other metallic iron is more lustrous and whiter than\r\nmagnetite when seen in reflected light, but such unaltered particles of\r\nthe mineral could only occur in a brick that had not been subjected to\r\ngreat heat.\r\n\r\nB. Opaque either in 1 or 2.\r\n\r\nIRON PYRITE only occurs as such in bricks that have not been thoroughly\r\nburnt, or in common “baked” bricks. Higher temperatures lead to the\r\nseparation of the iron from the sulphur and the general incorporation\r\nof both in the agglutination of the brick during partial fusion.\r\n\r\nA. Brassy yellow particles.\r\n\r\nB. Opaque both in 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nCALCITE.--Not found in burnt bricks, nor indeed in any except those\r\nthat have been sun-dried, or have been subjected to very little heat.\r\nSmall pellets of lime are of common occurrence in poorly-burnt bricks.\r\nIn reflected light such pellets are generally of a dirty white tint;\r\nopaque in transmitted light.\r\n\r\nDOLOMITE.--Practically the same observations apply as to calcite,\r\ncrystals of dolomite not being found except in sun-dried bricks and\r\nthe like. Under the action of much heat the mineral, like calcite, is\r\nreduced to lime.\r\n\r\nSELENITE.--This is not rare in the commoner class of bricks, though\r\nthe application of much heat reduces it to the state of powder. In\r\nreflected light it is found to be present as extremely minute specks or\r\n“tears” of whitish powdery plaster. Opaque, of course, in transmitted\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe description of the micro-appearance of many other minerals which\r\noccur but rarely in bricks does not fall within the scope of the\r\npresent elementary treatise; for practical purposes they may be\r\nignored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nABSORPTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advantage of knowing the relative absorptive capacity of bricks has\r\nbeen stated in these pages in divers connexions. The means of arriving\r\nat the total capacity for absorption of water, as generally practised\r\nby experimenters, are very incomplete and founded on an erroneous\r\nprinciple. It is admitted by all that absorption is one of the very\r\nbest tests as to the quality of a brick, but such tests are meaningless\r\nunless they imitate one or other or several of the influences to which\r\nthe brick would be subjected on being used in the building, or other\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nA common method is to weigh the brick when dry and then to immerse\r\nit in water for periods varying from one to three days, subsequently\r\nre-weighing it, the difference in weight between the dry and wet states\r\nbeing termed the brick’s “absorptive capacity.”\r\n\r\nMr. Heinrich Ries remarks[16] that the absorption is determined by\r\nweighing the thoroughly dry samples, immersing in clean water from\r\n48 to 72 hours, then wiping dry and weighing again. Vitrified bricks\r\nshould not show a gain in weight of over 2 per cent. There are cases\r\nwhere bricks of apparently good quality shew a greater absorption than\r\nthis, but they have great toughness and refractory qualities. Bricks\r\nmade from fire-clays which will not vitrify so easily will, naturally,\r\nshow higher absorption.\r\n\r\nAgain, Mr. E. S. Fickes, of Steubenville, Ohio, has recently made[17] a\r\nlarge series of valuable tests of both paving and building bricks, in\r\nwhich he shews the connexion between the power of absorption and the\r\nstrength of the materials experimented with. Mr. Fickes’ more important\r\nconclusions are:--\r\n\r\n1. The strength of the building brick, both transverse and crushing,\r\nvaries in tolerably close inverse ratio with the quantity of water\r\nabsorbed in twenty-four hours. The strongest bricks absorb the least\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n2. Good building bricks absorb from 6 to 12 per cent. in 24 hours, and\r\nwith no greater absorption than 12 per cent. will ordinarily show from\r\n7,000 to 10,000 or more pounds per square inch of ultimate crushing\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n3. Poor building bricks will absorb one-seventh to one-fourth of their\r\nweight of water in 24 hours, and average a little more than one-half\r\nthe transverse and crushing strength of good bricks.\r\n\r\n4. An immersed brick is nearly saturated in the first hour of\r\nimmersion, and in the remaining 23 hours the absorption is only\r\nfive-tenths to eight-tenths of 1 per cent. of its weight, as a rule.\r\n\r\nThese experiments are of much interest and are probably approximately\r\ncorrect; but we venture to think that if the absorption experiments had\r\nbeen carried out in a different manner, the results would have been\r\nstill more valuable.\r\n\r\nLong before the publication of the results of the last mentioned series\r\nof experiments, the present writer had discovered the close connexion\r\nwhich subsists between the relative absorptive capacity of bricks and\r\ntheir strength; a slight correction must be applied for specific\r\ngravity. We are not prepared to enter into this subject at any length,\r\nbut it may be observed that we should not have arrived at such close\r\nresults had we experimented in the same way as the American authors\r\njust quoted (or others, for the matter of that).\r\n\r\nWhen you completely immerse a brick in water you prevent the escape of\r\nair to a very large extent from the pores in the interior of the brick.\r\nAn old-fashioned way of overcoming this difficulty, was to place the\r\nbrick in the receiver of an air-pump and exhaust the air, subsequently\r\nimmersing the brick. This latter method certainly possessed the merit\r\nof enabling the experimenter to arrive at total absorption very\r\nrapidly, but it did not imitate natural processes any more than does\r\nthe thorough immersion of the brick in water.\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Builder_ of May 25th, 1895, p. 397, experimented as\r\nfollows:--The bricks were placed in water in a large vessel, on edge,\r\nsupported where necessary by flat blocks, to bring the uppermost face\r\nof each brick about ¼-inch above the surface of the water. Experience\r\nhad shewn that by completely immersing a brick, the air did not get\r\nan opportunity of escaping from its pores with the same facility as\r\nwhen one surface was left out of water. This disability, it was found,\r\nmaterially impaired the results of the rate of absorption (rate, as\r\nwell as total tests, being carried out). By arranging the experiments\r\nin the manner described, there can be no doubt that each brick absorbed\r\nthe maximum quantity of water possible; at any rate, there was no\r\nwater-pressure from above to retard the expulsion of the air.\r\n\r\nThe tests in the last-mentioned case extended over one week, the\r\nrelative absorption being taken at intervals of 1 second, 1 minute, 30\r\nminutes, 1 day, and at the end of the week. It was found that English\r\nvitrified bricks absorbed from 1.16 to about 1.85 per cent. in one\r\nweek; white glazed and good red and blue facing bricks from 5.31 to\r\n10.34 per cent. in one week; wire cut facers and rubbers, with white\r\ngaults, imbibed as much as from 12.93 to 20.50 per cent. of their dry\r\nweight in one week. The rate of percolation suggested many interesting\r\nproblems, not the least important being the effect of chemical\r\ndecomposition in prolonged immersions, whereby after being quiescent\r\nfor a few days (after taking in the water for a few hours), absorption\r\n“burst out” again and continued to the end of the week. One thing is\r\nvery apparent from this, namely, that for the lower grade brick even an\r\nimmersion for one week is not sufficient for practical purposes. The\r\nwriter remarks, “some of the red bricks from Bracknell, being placed\r\nin the vicinity of the white gault bricks (in the water), discoloured\r\nthe latter to such an extent as to disfigure them. It was not merely a\r\nsurface colouration; it extended to at least ¼-in. into the interior.\r\nThe red colouring matter was iron, but there was not enough of it by\r\nweight dissolved to materially interfere with the experiments. This\r\nvery clearly shews, however, the folly of erecting a building coursed\r\nwith white and red bricks, when both are very absorbent and the red has\r\nso little hold of the iron of which it is partly composed--unsightly\r\nstains are bound to appear.”\r\n\r\nThis question of the solubility of certain ingredients of bricks, has\r\nnot received the attention it deserves; and closely connected with\r\nthat is gradual decomposition, whereby the brick becomes more and more\r\nporous--a potent factor in its ultimate destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH OF BRICKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very great deal is known concerning the strength of bricks. In\r\naddition to the innumerable experiments carried out by public bodies,\r\nwe have the results of painstaking investigation by professors in\r\nuniversities and colleges, and the results carried out for and\r\npublished by brickmakers themselves. Yet another large series of\r\nresults have been published from time to time by professional\r\njournals, and it is, indeed, to these that we must look (at any\r\nrate in Britain) for anything like detailed work. The “Minutes of\r\nProceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers,” the “Transactions\r\nof the Royal Institute of British Architects,” the “Proceedings” of\r\nseveral allied provincial architectural societies, the “Builder,” the\r\n“British Clayworker,” builders’ “Price Books,” and several engineering\r\n“Handbooks,” have all contributed to our knowledge in regard to the\r\nstrength of bricks. Of works consecrated entirely to the subject there\r\nare none--applied to British materials; but we have that excellent\r\ntext-book by Professor Unwin, F.R.S., “The Testing of Materials of\r\nConstruction,” and the important work by Mr. David Kirkaldy, both of\r\nthe greatest possible value as being the results, largely, of original\r\nwork. The experiments of recent years have been made almost exclusively\r\nby Mr. David Kirkaldy at his works in Southwark; by Professor W. C.\r\nUnwin at the Central Institution of the City and Guilds of London\r\nInstitute; and by the Yorkshire College, Leeds.\r\n\r\nWith such a wealth of information a whole treatise might profitably\r\nbe written, but it will be understood that in a small work like the\r\npresent we can only give a comparatively few results, prefaced by\r\nobservations to impart a general idea.\r\n\r\nWith the strength of brickwork, it is different, and it would seem\r\nrather remarkable, at first sight, that architects and engineers, who\r\nare every day using thousands of bricks, should have been at little\r\npains to ascertain the “safe load” which this or that brick pier or\r\nwall would carry. Experience is, of course, of great value in all work\r\nof that description; but there is always the lurking suspicion that the\r\nengineer is making his piers too big, and that the architect is by no\r\nmeans running the thing close. The real reason why so little has been\r\ndone to test the strength of brickwork is the difficulty in getting\r\nmachines of such capacity as would crush sufficiently large masses.\r\nSmall piers have been built from time to time, and bricks embedded in\r\nputty for mortar have served their purpose, but practically nothing\r\nof a really serious nature was carried out in Britain until a few\r\nmonths ago. The science committee of the Institute of Architects, well\r\nknowing the advantage of information as to the strength of brickwork,\r\nhave partially carried out a most elaborate series of experiments,\r\nthe first fruits of which have already been published, but it would\r\nbe out of place to allude to them here. When the remaining brickwork\r\nshall have been built long enough at the experimental station, the\r\nfinal experiments will be made, and the results will, we have no doubt,\r\nbe the most important contribution to our knowledge concerning the\r\nstrength of brickwork that has ever been published in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nBut we must give our attention solely to the strength of bricks. To\r\nbegin with, we must deprecate the idea that experiments as at present\r\ncarried out give anything like the actual strength of bricks--the\r\nresults are generally either too high or too low. Neither are the\r\nresults comparative, except to a limited extent. One kind of brick has\r\na “frog” on one side, another is recessed on both sides, a third is\r\nstamped with the maker’s name, or some device by way of trade mark,\r\na fourth is as flat on all sides as may be, a fifth is pressed, a\r\nsixth is hand made, and a seventh wire-cut, and there are many other\r\nvarieties of make. With such different kinds it is next to impossible\r\nto arrive at comparative data that shall be of much use for working\r\npurposes. Again, the whole brick may be subject to the experiment, or\r\nonly the half-brick. The faces placed between the dies of the crushing\r\nmachine may not be flat, and they are most frequently irregular. If\r\nthe dies are applied to such bricks it is evident that corners will\r\nbe broken off before the brick has really suffered much, and that to\r\nget the best result the faces must either be made perfectly true and\r\nparallel to each other, or some other method adopted to put matters\r\nright. That commonly employed is to place some yielding substance\r\nbetween the faces and the surface of the dies. Sometimes thin sheets\r\nof lead or pine wood are inserted. Professor Unwin has the faces of\r\nthe brick made smooth and parallel by means of plaster of Paris, and\r\nthe brick is then crushed between two pieces of millboard or between\r\nthe iron pressure-plates, one plate having an arrangement to allow for\r\nany slight want of parallelism between the two surfaces of the brick\r\napplied to the plates.\r\n\r\nNow it will be obvious, what with the difference in the shape and the\r\nvarious modes of experimenting, that the results are by no means\r\ncomparative unless the precise facts are given; and when they are, it\r\nis but rarely that you can find more than half-a-dozen or so kinds\r\nof bricks of each category that offer all the elements necessary for\r\ncomparison. So that, with all the wealth of information, we are by no\r\nmeans laden with much that is of actual comparative value, and if the\r\nexperiments and their results are not comparative, of what use are\r\nthey? So long as experimenters are each allowed a different method of\r\nresearch, and so long as makers will have partial or whole “frogs,”\r\nwill stamp their names or initials, or will produce plain bricks only,\r\nso long will it be impossible to arrive at the best results that are\r\nreally attainable. What we want is a government testing station as\r\nthey have in Germany; or, at least, the mode of experimenting should\r\nbe under some central control. The experimenter, further, should\r\nselect the samples to be crushed, and should be at liberty to publish\r\nall results obtained. At present, if the brickmaker does not like\r\nthe results arrived at, he, of course, does not publish them. And,\r\nif he has had a number of experiments carried out from time to time,\r\nhe will, usually, quote only the highest results on his bricks. That\r\nis perfectly natural, and would be understood as “business.” All\r\nbrickmakers may not do that, and a few may publish every or average\r\nresults (we do not mean of one set of experiments, on say six bricks)\r\nof different experiments, but we fancy they are very rare. Therefore,\r\nin a matter so important to the architect and the engineer, and indeed\r\nto the general public, from the point of view of safety, we maintain\r\nthat the whole thing should be carried out under some central control,\r\nas on the continent.\r\n\r\nAnd now to proceed with the description of results on a few typical\r\nbricks. Glancing at table I, we may say that the strength of bricks\r\nas a whole is often quoted as here given, and has done duty for many\r\nyears as the average strength of bricks. These bricks were crushed in a\r\nClayton machine, and all were bedded upon a thickness of felt and laid\r\nupon an iron faced plate, and the experiments were conducted by the\r\nMetropolitan Board of Works.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH OF BRICKS.--I.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------\r\n          Description.        | Pressure in tons to\r\n                              +----------+---------\r\n                              |   Crack. | Crush.\r\n  ----------------------------+----------+---------\r\n  Four white bricks, each     |   16.25  | 41.00\r\n  Three  „     „      „       |   17.05  | 41.05\r\n  Red bricks, ordinary        |   13.00  | 26.25\r\n  Red bricks, not well burned |   13.75  | 25.05\r\n  Best Paviours               |   14.00  | 23.00\r\n  Grey Stocks, London         |   12.00  | 14.00\r\n  ----------------------------+----------+---------\r\n\r\nTurning to the second table, compiled for the most part from\r\nbrickmakers’ circulars, and from the original results obtained for\r\nthe late Building Exhibition, at the Agricultural Hall, all the\r\nexperiments, we believe, having been carried out by Mr. David Kirkaldy,\r\nit will be noted that great variation in strength is apparent,\r\nfollowing the different kinds of bricks. The highest result, 1064.2\r\ntons per square foot, was obtained on a blue Staffordshire brick,\r\nthough that is very closely run by bricks made from slate débris\r\n(1056.2 tons) from South Wales.

Yet the figures must not be taken\r\ntoo seriously. Glancing at those relating to “London Stocks,” we find\r\nthe strength varied from 103 tons per square foot to 181 tons. But\r\nmore recent experiments made by Professor Unwin[19] on some London\r\nStocks from Sittingbourne, in Kent, shewed that with four samples one\r\ncrushed at 60.76 tons per square foot and another gave out 94.6 tons,\r\nthe mean strength of the four yielding 84.27 tons per square foot.\r\nWith such heterogeneous materials as London Stocks, we ought not to be\r\nsurprised at these results, but they form a striking commentary on the\r\nvalue of general statements concerning the strength of bricks of varied\r\ncharacter going by the same name in the market.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the strength of homogeneous bricks, and especially\r\nwhere these latter are made of thick marine clays, or where the\r\nrelative proportions of earths employed are carefully attended\r\nto in the raw material, the results appear to be more generally\r\napplicable--as far as they go.\r\n\r\nWith ordinary Gault bricks we find a range in strength from 145 tons to\r\n173 tons per square foot; but Professor Unwin,[20] in his more recent\r\nexperiments, finds that of four Gault bricks, one reached as high as\r\n197.6 tons per square foot, and he gives 182.2 tons as the average\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nTo shew the absurdity of alluding to the strength of “blue\r\nStaffordshire” bricks, without also giving the precise locale of the\r\nsamples dealt with, the reader is requested to refer to Table III.,\r\nwhere the figures indicate a range from 275 tons to 464 tons per square\r\nfoot, and to compare them with the results on Staffordshire bricks as\r\nstated in Table II., where we find a range from 651 tons to 1,064.2\r\ntons per square foot. Of what value can a single formula be which gives\r\nthe strength of Staffordshire bricks as a whole as based on such widely\r\ndivergent figures as these? Professor Unwin, in his recent series of\r\nexperiments alluded to, finds that with four Staffordshire blue bricks,\r\nthe weakest gave a result of 564.8 tons per square foot, and the\r\nstrongest 788 tons; the mean of the four being 701.1 tons per square\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nThe results on the Leicester “reds” are no more encouraging; the\r\nfigures in the foregoing tables are 150.6 tons, 229 tons, 308 tons, and\r\n337 tons per square foot. Similarly, Professor Unwin has more recently\r\nfound that the Leicester “reds” from Elliston, near Leicester, bear a\r\ncrushing strain varying from 311.4 tons to 591.4 tons per square foot\r\nin four samples.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it will appear to the reader that average results\r\nare of very little value to the architect or engineer, unless--(1)\r\nthe brickyard is mentioned from which the bricks experimented with\r\ncame; (2) the particular class of brick from that yard; (3) the method\r\nof experimenting, as to whether any substance was placed between the\r\ndies of the press and the brick to be crushed, and if so, what; (4) if\r\nrecessed or initialled; (5) whether machine or hand made, and (6) as to\r\nwhether the surfaces of the bricks were concave, convex, or flat.\r\n\r\nResults on bricks not localised are not of much value, and it is\r\nabsolutely useless for working purposes to give in one figure the\r\nstrength of “London Stocks,” “Staffordshire blues,” “Leicestershire\r\nreds,” and the like. In a general way, of course, it will be admitted\r\nthat the “Staffordshire blue” is a stronger brick than the “London\r\nStock,” and so forth; but that is as much as can be permitted--it is of\r\nno practical use to give relative figures in general terms.\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens that the capacity of the machine used for testing\r\nthe strength of bricks is not enough for those bricks having a very\r\nhigh resistance to crushing. In the recent experiments by Professor\r\nUnwin, more than once alluded to in this article, it was found\r\nnecessary to experiment with half-bricks only, and he ascertained that\r\nbricks tested as half-bricks shew about 25 per cent. less resistance\r\nper square foot than when tested as whole bricks.\r\n\r\nFurther observations on strength are made under the next heading in\r\nconnexion with other forms of testing the value and physical properties\r\nof bricks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nABRASION, SPECIFIC GRAVITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Abrasion._--In this country it is not customary to test bricks and\r\nstone by means of the abrasion process, though many English materials\r\nhave been dealt with in this manner on the continent.\r\n\r\nAbrasion tests are of special value in regard to paving bricks, and\r\nthis mode of experiment is largely carried out in the United States.\r\nAs Mr. H. Ries remarks,[21] the abrasion test approximates closely the\r\nconditions under which the paving brick is used, and is, therefore, an\r\nimportant one. The usual method of conducting this test is to put the\r\nbricks in an ordinary “foundry rattler,” filling it about one-third\r\nfull. It is then rotated at the rate of about 30 revolutions per\r\nminute, and about 1,000 turns are sufficient. The bricks are weighed\r\nbefore and after to determine loss by abrasion.\r\n\r\nA more recent modification is to line the “rattler” with the bricks to\r\nbe tested and then put in loose scrap iron. This is claimed to give\r\nmore accurate results, and avoids loss by chipping due to the bricks\r\nknocking against each other, as in the previous method, although\r\nthat has been somewhat obviated by Professor Orton, jun., by the\r\nintroduction of a few billets of wood into the rattler.\r\n\r\nThe abrasion test may also be made by putting the weighed bricks on\r\na grinding table covered with sand and water, and noting the weight\r\nbefore and after grinding. This last method seems to us to be decidedly\r\nthe best, provided the bricks be weighted, that the weight is constant,\r\nthat the feed of sand and water is uniform, and that the bricks to be\r\ntested are placed equidistant from the centre of the turning table. If\r\nthis last point be not attended to, it will be obvious that in course\r\nof the revolutions the sand will tend to accumulate towards the centre\r\nof the table, and the bricks placed in that vicinity would receive\r\nmore than their fair share of abrasion, as compared with those bricks\r\nsituated near the edge of the table. Conversely, those bricks near\r\nthe periphery would be subjected to greater grinding action, from the\r\ncircumstance that the table would move faster underneath them than\r\nunder those bricks nearer the centre of the table.\r\n\r\nThe bricks should certainly be weighted in such abrasion tests, and\r\nit seems desirable that the weights should be so adjusted that the\r\nweight of the brick is also taken into account. It is obvious that the\r\nabrading action of, say, street traffic, will be the same on a brick,\r\nno matter what the latter weighs, depending on the area of surface\r\nexposed to traffic. And if we experiment with one brick, weighing say 7\r\nlbs., and another weighing 14 lbs., the greater weight of the latter,\r\nwill (_cæteris paribus_), by the abrasion tests as usually adopted,\r\ngive a much higher result than would the lighter brick. On the other\r\nhand, if the 7 lbs. brick be weighted another 7 lbs., then the results\r\nwould be strictly comparable, provided always that the area exposed to\r\nabrasion in each case be the same, and that the other conditions we\r\nhave laid down are strictly observed.\r\n\r\nKnowing as we do that the rough and ready method of “rattling” cannot\r\npossibly give truly comparative results, we do not intend to enlarge\r\nmuch on the results of the American tests; but the following are\r\nsuggestive as shewing the connexion between the tests for absorption,\r\nrattling, and strength combined.\r\n\r\nSome valuable and interesting tests were recently made by the Ohio\r\nGeological Survey, to determine the relative merits of fire-clays and\r\nshales for the manufacture of paving bricks, as well as the influence,\r\nif any, of the method of manufacture adopted. Twenty-two varieties of\r\nshale bricks, or bricks the largest constituent of which is shale, were\r\ngrouped together: fifteen varieties of fire-clay brick; four varieties\r\ncomposed of shale and fire-clay mixed in equal proportion; and three\r\nvarieties made from Ohio River sedimentary clays. The averages of these\r\nfour classes of results were as follow:--\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------------------\r\n    TESTS OF FIRE-CLAY AND SHALES.--PAVING BRICKS.\r\n  ----------+-----------+---------+-----------------\r\n            |Absorption.|Rattling.|    Crushing.\r\n            +-----------+---------+--------+--------\r\n            |           |         |Square  | Cubic\r\n            |           |         |Inches. | Inches.\r\n            |           |         +--------+--------\r\n  Shales    |   1.17    | 17.61   | 7,307  |  1,764\r\n  Fire-clay |   1.62    | 17.32   | 6,876  |  1,678\r\n  Mixture   |   1.44    | 18.72   | 5,788  |  1,400\r\n  River Clay|   1.36    | 19.02   | 4,605  |  1,176\r\n  ----------+-----------+---------+--------+--------\r\n\r\nFrom a series of tests recently made by Mr. Fickes,[22] the following\r\nfactors were educed:--\r\n\r\n1. A brick which stands the “rattling” test well, has ample crushing\r\nstrength and rarely chips under less than 5,000 lbs. per square inch,\r\nor crushes under less than 10,000 lbs. The crushing strength tends to\r\nvary with the resistance to abrasion, however, but more slowly and\r\nirregularly.\r\n\r\n2. The transverse strength also tends to vary with the resistance to\r\nabrasion, but more slowly and irregularly.\r\n\r\n3. The toughest bricks usually absorb the least water.\r\n\r\n_Specific Gravity._--The practical value of knowing the specific\r\ngravity of a brick has, perhaps, been a little over-rated by writers on\r\nthe subject. At the same time we do not deny that there is some use in\r\nascertaining this property. Foremost, we have to mention its value in\r\nconjunction with absorption in arriving at a rough and ready means of\r\ngauging the strength of a brick, without having actual recourse to the\r\ncrushing machine. It appears to us, however, that the specific gravity\r\nof bricks is rarely quoted in a proper manner, and until there is one\r\nuniform method, the results will always be at a discount. We allude to\r\nthe fact that some experimenters take the specific gravity of a porous\r\nbrick, without stating whether the amount of water absorbed, during the\r\nprocess, was taken into account in arriving at the specific gravity\r\nor not. Theoretically, of course, the substance to be dealt with is\r\nnon-porous, and experimenters, worthy the name, either render the\r\nbrick waterproof, or, ascertaining the amount of water the brick has\r\nabsorbed, take that into consideration in calculating results.\r\n\r\nThe writer is in the habit of quoting the specific gravity in two ways,\r\nviz.: (_a_) the true specific gravity, and (_b_) the specific gravity\r\nof the particles. In an elementary treatise like the present, however,\r\nit is not desirable to enlarge on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This, and all other technical terms used, will be explained in an\r\nalphabetical glossary at the end of the book.\r\n\r\n[2] “Canal and River Engineering,” p. 315.\r\n\r\n[3] See, Geikie’s “Text Book of Geology,” 1882, p. 72.\r\n\r\n[4] Information on this subject will be found in Mr. J. H.

the\r\nend of the book.\r\n\r\nPunctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant\r\npreference was found in the original book; otherwise they were not\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nInconsistent hyphenation was not changed.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced quotation\r\nmarks were remedied when the change was obvious, and otherwise left\r\nunbalanced.\r\n\r\nFigures 1 and 4 were repositioned slightly in the paragraphs that\r\nreference them, thereby splitting those paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe uncaptioned illustration above the second advertisement is an image\r\nof that advertisement. The uncaptioned illustration at the end of the\r\nbook is decorative.\r\n\r\nIn this Plain Text version of the eBook, the chemical formulas on pages\r\n76–77 are shown unsubscripted, e.g., H2O.\r\n\r\nThe original book used middle-dots to represent decimal points; this\r\neBook uses baseline periods.\r\n\r\nThe index was not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page\r\nreferences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Science of Brickmaking, by Georg F.
