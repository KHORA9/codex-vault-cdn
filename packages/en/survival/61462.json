P. Gorham,\r\nchairman, L. A. Rogers, W. G. Bissell, H. E. Hasseltine, H. W. Redfield,\r\nwith M. Levine as adjunct member. This committee made a report in 1918\r\nwhich was not acted on by the Laboratory Section, and in 1919 made a\r\nrevised report, recommending certain changes in Standard Methods, which\r\nwere adopted by the section and which are now incorporated in this\r\npresent fourth edition.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the more important changes:\r\n\r\nNew brands of peptone authorized.\r\n\r\nPhenol Red Method of Hydrogen-ion Concentration.\r\n\r\nFive-tenths per cent of sugar specified for broths instead of 1 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nSterilization of sugar is media specified in greater detail.\r\n\r\nPreparation of Endo Medium.\r\n\r\nSynthetic Medium for the Methyl Red Test.\r\n\r\nThere are no changes in the chemical methods in this edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION.\r\n                         _LABORATORY SECTION._\r\n       STANDARD METHODS FOR THE EXAMINATION OF WATER AND SEWAGE.\r\n\r\nCompiled and revised by committees of the American Public Health\r\nAssociation and the American Chemical Society and referees of the\r\nAssociation of Official Agricultural Chemists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         COLLECTION OF SAMPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    QUANTITY REQUIRED FOR ANALYSIS.\r\n\r\nThe minimum quantity necessary for making the ordinary physical,\r\nchemical, and microscopical analyses of water or sewage is 2 liters; for\r\nthe bacteriological examination, 100 cc. In special analyses larger\r\nquantities may be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOTTLES.\r\n\r\nThe bottles for the collection of samples shall have glass stoppers,\r\nexcept when physical, mineral, or microscopical examinations only are to\r\nbe made. Jugs or metal containers shall not be used.\r\n\r\nSample bottles shall be carefully cleansed each time before using. This\r\nmay be done by treating with sulfuric acid and potassium bichromate, or\r\nwith alkaline permanganate, followed by a mixture of oxalic and sulfuric\r\nacids, and by thoroughly rinsing with water and draining. The stoppers\r\nand necks of the bottles shall be protected from dirt by tying cloth,\r\nthick paper or tin foil over them.\r\n\r\nFor shipment bottles shall be packed in cases with a separate\r\ncompartment for each bottle. Wooden boxes may be lined with corrugated\r\nfibre paper, felt, or similar substance, or provided with spring corner\r\nstrips, to prevent breakage. Lined wicker baskets also may be used.\r\n\r\nBottles for bacteriological samples shall be sterilized as directed on\r\npage 98.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       INTERVAL BEFORE ANALYSIS.\r\n\r\nIn general, the shorter the time elapsing between the collection and the\r\nanalysis of a sample the more reliable will be the analytical results.\r\nUnder many conditions analyses made in the field are to be commended, as\r\ndata so obtained are frequently preferable to data obtained in a distant\r\nlaboratory after the composition of the water has changed.\r\n\r\nThe time that may be allowed to elapse between the collection of a\r\nsample and the beginning of its analysis cannot be stated definitely. It\r\ndepends on the character of the sample, the examinations to be made, and\r\nother conditions. The following are suggested as fairly reasonable\r\nmaximum limits.\r\n\r\n                   _Physical and chemical analysis._\r\n\r\n       Ground waters                       72 hours\r\n       Fairly pure surface waters          48   \"\r\n       Polluted surface waters             12   \"\r\n       Sewage effluents                     6   \"\r\n       Raw sewages                          6   \"\r\n\r\n       _Microscopical examination._\r\n\r\n       Ground waters                       72 hours\r\n       Fairly pure surface waters          24   \"\r\n       Waters containing fragile organisms Immediate  examination\r\n\r\n       _Bacteriological examination._\r\n\r\n       Samples kept at less than 10°C      24 hours\r\n\r\nIf a longer period elapses between collection and examination the time\r\nshould be noted. If sterilized by the addition of chloroform,\r\nformaldehyde, mercuric chloride, or some other germicide samples for\r\nsanitary chemical examination may be allowed to stand for longer periods\r\nthan those indicated, but as this is a matter which will vary according\r\nto circumstances, no definite procedure is recommended. If unsterilized\r\nsamples of sewage, sewage effluents, and highly polluted surface waters\r\nare analyzed after greater intervals than those suggested caution must\r\nbe used in interpreting analyses of the organic content, which\r\nfrequently changes materially upon standing.\r\n\r\nDeterminations of dissolved gases, especially oxygen, hydrogen sulfide,\r\nand carbon dioxide, should be made at the time of collection in order to\r\nbe reasonably accurate, in accordance with the directions given\r\nhereafter in connection with each determination.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to obtain a sample that is truly representative of\r\nthe liquid to be analyzed. With sewages this is especially important\r\nbecause marked variations in composition occur from hour to hour.\r\nSatisfactory samples of some liquids can be obtained only by mixing\r\ntogether several portions collected at different times or at different\r\nplaces—the details as to collection and mixing depending upon local\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PHYSICAL EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the sample, if taken, shall be taken at the time of\r\ncollection, and shall be expressed preferably in degrees Centigrade, to\r\nthe nearest degree, or closer if more precise data are required. The\r\nthermophone[109] is recommended for obtaining the temperature of water\r\nat various depths below the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TURBIDITY.\r\n\r\nThe turbidity of water is due to suspended matter, such as clay, silt,\r\nfinely divided organic matter, microscopic organisms, and similar\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TURBIDITY STANDARD.[110]\r\n\r\nThe standard of turbidity shall be that adopted by the United States\r\nGeological Survey, namely, a water which contains 100 parts per million\r\nof silica in such a state of fineness that a bright platinum wire 1\r\nmillimeter in diameter can just be seen when the center of the wire is\r\n100 millimeters below the surface of the water and the eye of the\r\nobserver is 1.2 meters above the wire, the observation being made in the\r\nmiddle of the day, in the open air, but not in sunlight, and in a vessel\r\nso large that the sides do not shut out the light so as to influence the\r\nresults. The turbidity of such water is arbitrarily fixed at 100 parts\r\nper million.\r\n\r\nFor preparation of the silica standard dry Pear’s “precipitated fuller’s\r\nearth” and sift it through a 200–mesh sieve. One gram of this\r\npreparation in 1 liter of distilled water makes a stock suspension which\r\ncontains 1,000 parts per million of silica and which should have a\r\nturbidity of 1,000. Test this suspension, after diluting a portion of it\r\nwith nine times its volume of distilled water, by the platinum wire\r\nmethod to ascertain if the silica has the necessary degree of fineness\r\nand if the suspension has the necessary degree of turbidity. If not,\r\ncorrect by adding more silica or more water as the case demands.[A]\r\n\r\nFootnote A:\r\n\r\n  This method of correction very slightly alters the coefficient of\r\n  fineness of the standard, but does not noticeably affect its use.\r\n\r\nStandards for comparison shall be prepared from this stock suspension by\r\ndilution with distilled water. For turbidity readings below 20,\r\nstandards of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 shall be kept in clear glass bottles\r\nof the same size as that containing the sample; for readings above 20,\r\nstandards of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 shall be kept in\r\n100 cc. Nessler tubes approximately 20 millimeters in diameter.\r\n\r\nComparison with the standards shall be made by viewing both standard and\r\nsample sidewise toward the light by looking at some object and noting\r\nthe distinctness with which the margins of the object can be seen.\r\n\r\nThe standards shall be kept stoppered, and both sample and standards\r\nshall be thoroughly shaken before making the comparison.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent any bacterial or algal growths from developing in\r\nthe standards a small amount of mercury bichloride may be added to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PLATINUM WIRE METHOD.[42]\r\n\r\nThis method requires a rod with a platinum wire 1 mm. in diameter\r\ninserted in it about 1 inch from one end of the rod and projecting from\r\nit at a right angle at least 25 mm. Near the other end of the rod, at a\r\ndistance of 1.2 meters from the platinum wire, a small ring shall be\r\nplaced directly above the wire through which, with his eye directly\r\nabove the ring, the observer shall look when making the examination.\r\n\r\nThe rod shall be graduated as follows: The graduation mark of 100 shall\r\nbe placed on the rod at a distance of 100 mm. from the center of the\r\nwire. Other graduations shall be made according to Table 1, which is\r\nbased on the best obtainable data. The distances recorded in Table 1 are\r\nintended to be such that when the water is diluted the turbidity\r\nreadings will decrease in the same proportion as the percentage of the\r\noriginal water in the mixture. These graduations are those on what is\r\nknown as the U. S. Geological Survey Turbidity Rod of 1902.[105]\r\n\r\n                  Table 1.—GRADUATION OF TURBIDITY ROD.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────\r\n              Turbidity             │  Vanishing depth of wire (mm.).\r\n        (parts per million).        │\r\n                                    │\r\n ───────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────\r\n                                   7│                             1095\r\n                                   8│                              971\r\n                                   9│                              873\r\n                                  10│                              794\r\n                                  11│                              729\r\n                                  12│                              674\r\n                                  13│                              627\r\n                                  14│                              587\r\n                                  15│                              551\r\n                                  16│                              520\r\n                                  17│                              493\r\n                                  18│                              468\r\n                                  19│                              446\r\n                                  20│                              426\r\n                                  22│                              391\r\n                                  24│                              361\r\n                                  26│                              336\r\n                                  28│                              314\r\n                                  30│                              296\r\n                                  35│                              257\r\n                                  40│                              228\r\n                                  45│                              205\r\n                                  50│                              187\r\n                                  55│                              171\r\n                                  60│                              158\r\n                                  65│                              147\r\n                                  70│                              138\r\n                                  75│                              130\r\n                                  80│                              122\r\n                                  85│                              116\r\n                                  90│                              110\r\n                                  95│                              105\r\n                                 100│                              100\r\n                                 110│                               93\r\n                                 120│                               86\r\n                                 130│                               81\r\n                                 140│                               76\r\n                                 150│                               72\r\n                                 160│                               68.7\r\n                                 180│                               62.4\r\n                                 200│                               57.4\r\n                                 250│                               49.1\r\n                                 300│                               43.2\r\n                                 350│                               38.8\r\n                                 400│                               35.4\r\n                                 500│                               30.9\r\n                                 600│                               27.7\r\n                                 800│                               23.4\r\n                                1000│                               20.9\r\n                                1500│                               17.1\r\n                                2000│                               14.8\r\n                                3000│                               12.1\r\n ───────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Lower the rod vertically into the water as far as the wire\r\ncan be seen and read the level of the surface of the water on the\r\ngraduated scale. This will indicate the turbidity.\r\n\r\nThe following precautions shall be taken to insure correct results:\r\n\r\nObservations shall be made in the open air, preferably in the middle of\r\nthe day and not in direct sunlight. The wire shall be kept bright and\r\nclean. If for any reason observations cannot be made directly under\r\nnatural conditions a pail or tank may be filled with water and the\r\nobservation taken in that, but if this is done care shall be taken that\r\nthe water is thoroughly stirred before the observation is made, and no\r\nvessel shall be used for this purpose unless its diameter is at least\r\ntwice as great as the depth to which the wire is immersed. Waters which\r\nhave a turbidity greater than 500 shall be diluted with clear water\r\nbefore the observations are made, but if this is done the degree of\r\ndilution shall be reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TURBIDIMETRIC METHOD.\r\n\r\nSeveral forms of turbidimeter or diaphanometer[73] have been suggested\r\nfor use. The simplest and most satisfactory form is the candle\r\nturbidimeter.[116] This consists of a graduated glass tube with a flat\r\npolished bottom, enclosed in a metal case. This is supported over an\r\nEnglish standard candle and so arranged that one may look vertically\r\ndown through the tube at the flame of the candle. The observation is\r\nmade by pouring the sample of water into the tube until the image of the\r\nflame of the candle just disappears from view. Care shall be taken not\r\nto allow soot or moisture to accumulate on the lower side of the glass\r\nbottom of the tube so as to interfere with the accuracy of the\r\nobservations. The graduations on the tube correspond to turbidities\r\nproduced in distilled water by certain numbers of parts per million of\r\nsilica standard. In order to insure uniform results it is necessary to\r\nhave the distance between the top rim of the candle and the bottom of\r\nthe tube constant, and this distance shall be 7.6 cm. or 3 inches. The\r\nobservations shall be made in a darkened room or with a black cloth over\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\nIt is allowable to substitute for the candle an electric light.\r\nCalibrate the apparatus to correspond with the United States Geological\r\nSurvey scale. The figures in Table 2 on page 8 are believed to be\r\napproximately correct for the candle turbidimeter but should be checked\r\nby the experimenter. It is allowable to calibrate the tube of the\r\ninstrument with waters of known turbidity prepared by making a series of\r\ndilutions of the silica standard with distilled water. From the figures\r\nobtained in calibrating plot a curve from which the turbidity of a\r\nsample may be read when the depth of water in the tube has been\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n               Table 2.—GRADUATION OF CANDLE TURBIDIMETER.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────\r\n           Depth of liquid          │             Turbidity\r\n               (cm.).               │  (parts per million of silica).\r\n ───────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────\r\n                                 2.3│                               1000\r\n                                 2.6│                                900\r\n                                 2.9│                                800\r\n                                 3.2│                                700\r\n                                 3.5│                                650\r\n                                 3.8│                                600\r\n                                 4.1│                                550\r\n                                 4.5│                                500\r\n                                 4.9│                                450\r\n                                 5.5│                                400\r\n                                 5.6│                                390\r\n                                 5.8│                                380\r\n                                 5.9│                                370\r\n                                 6.1│                                360\r\n                                 6.3│                                350\r\n                                 6.4│                                340\r\n                                 6.6│                                330\r\n                                 6.8│                                320\r\n                                 7.0│                                310\r\n                                 7.3│                                300\r\n                                 7.5│                                290\r\n                                 7.8│                                280\r\n                                 8.1│                                270\r\n                                 8.4│                                260\r\n                                 8.7│                                250\r\n                                 9.1│                                240\r\n                                 9.5│                                230\r\n                                 9.9│                                220\r\n                                10.3│                                210\r\n                                10.9│                                200\r\n                                11.4│                                190\r\n                                12.0│                                180\r\n                                12.7│                                170\r\n                                13.5│                                160\r\n                                14.4│                                150\r\n                                15.4│                                140\r\n                                16.6│                                130\r\n                                18.0│                                120\r\n                                19.6│                                110\r\n                                21.5│                                100\r\n ───────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\nThe results of turbidity observations shall be expressed in whole\r\nnumbers which correspond to parts per million of silica and recorded as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n      Turbidity between │   1│and│     50│recorded to nearest│unit\r\n          \"        \"    │  51│ \" │    100│   \"     \"     \"   │   5\r\n          \"        \"    │ 101│ \" │    500│   \"     \"     \"   │  10\r\n          \"        \"    │ 501│ \" │   1000│   \"     \"     \"   │  50\r\n          \"        \"    │1001│ \" │greater│   \"     \"     \"   │ 100\r\n\r\n\r\n                      COEFFICIENT OF FINENESS[80]\r\n\r\nThe quotient obtained by dividing the weight of suspended matter in the\r\nsample by the turbidity, both expressed in the same unit, shall be\r\ncalled the coefficient of fineness. If the quotient is greater than\r\nunity the matter in suspension is coarser and if it is less than unity\r\nit is finer than the standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 COLOR.\r\n\r\nThe “color,” or the “true color,” of water shall be considered the color\r\nthat is due only to substances in solution; that is, it is the color of\r\nthe water after the suspended matter has been removed. In stating\r\nresults the word “color” shall mean the “true color” unless otherwise\r\ndesignated.\r\n\r\nThe “apparent color” shall be considered as including not only the true\r\ncolor but also any color produced by substances in suspension. It is the\r\ncolor of the original unfiltered sample.\r\n\r\nThe platinum-cobalt method of measuring color shall be considered as the\r\nstandard, and the unit of color shall be that produced by 1 part per\r\nmillion of platinum.\r\n\r\n\r\n             COMPARISON WITH PLATINUM-COBALT STANDARDS.[43]\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—Dissolve 1.246 grams of potassium platinic chloride\r\n(PtCl_{4}2KCl), containing 0.5 gram platinum, and 1.00 gram crystallized\r\ncobalt chloride (CoCl_{2}.6H_{2}O), containing 0.25 gram of cobalt, in\r\nwater with 100 cc. concentrated hydrochloric acid, and dilute to 1 liter\r\nwith distilled water. This solution has a color of 500. Dilute this\r\nsolution with distilled water in 50 cc. Nessler tubes to prepare\r\nstandards having colors of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, and\r\n70. Keep these standards in Nessler tubes of such diameter that the\r\ngraduation mark is between 20 and 25 cm. above the bottom and of such\r\nuniformity that they match within such limit that the distance from the\r\nbottom to the graduation mark of the longest tube shall not exceed that\r\nof the shortest tube by more than 6 mm. Protect the tubes from dust and\r\nlight when not in use.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—The color of a sample shall be observed by filling a\r\nstandard Nessler tube to the height equal to that in the standard tubes\r\nwith the sample and by comparing it with the standards. The observation\r\nshall be made by looking vertically downward through the tubes upon a\r\nwhite or mirrored surface placed at such angle that light is reflected\r\nupward through the column of liquid.\r\n\r\nWater that has a color greater than 70 shall be diluted before making\r\nthe comparison, in order that no difficulties may be encountered in\r\nmatching the hues.\r\n\r\nWater containing matter in suspension shall be filtered, before the\r\ncolor observation is made, until no visible turbidity remains. If the\r\nsuspended matter is coarse, filter paper may be used for this purpose;\r\nif the suspended matter is fine, the use of a Berkefeld filter is\r\nrecommended. The Pasteur filter shall not be used as it exerts a marked\r\ndecolorizing action.\r\n\r\nThe apparent color, if determined, shall be determined on the original\r\nsample without filtration. The true and the apparent color of clear\r\nwaters or waters with low turbidities are substantially the same.\r\n\r\nThe results of color determinations shall be expressed in whole numbers\r\nand recorded as follows:\r\n\r\n           Color between   1 and  50 recorded to nearest unit\r\n             \"       \"    51  \"  100    \"    \"     \"        5\r\n             \"       \"   101  \"  250    \"    \"     \"       10\r\n             \"       \"   251  \"  500    \"    \"     \"      20.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   COMPARISON WITH GLASS DISKS.[105]\r\n\r\nAs the platinum-cobalt standard method is not well adapted for field\r\nwork, the color of the water to be tested may be compared with that of\r\nglass disks held at the end of metallic tubes through which they are\r\nviewed by looking toward a white surface. The glass disks are\r\nindividually calibrated to correspond with colors on the platinum scale.\r\nExperience has shown that the glass disks used by the U. S. Geological\r\nSurvey give results in substantial agreement with those obtained by the\r\nplatinum determinations, and their use is recognized as a standard\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   COMPARISON WITH NESSLER STANDARDS.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the Nessler scale[62] and the natural water scale[22][49]\r\nwhich agrees with it except for colors less than 20, have been largely\r\nused in the past, the old results may be converted[117] into terms of\r\nthe platinum standard by means of the ratios in Table 3, but they must\r\nnot be considered as universally applicable as the variable\r\nsensitiveness of the Nessler solution introduces an uncertain factor.\r\n\r\n  Table 3.—VALUES FOR CONVERTING COLORS BY THE NATURAL WATER SCALE INTO\r\n        COLORS BY THE PLATINUM STANDARD IN PARTS PER MILLION.[B]\r\n\r\n ───────────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────\r\n  Modified  │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │\r\n Nessler or │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │\r\n   natural  │0.00.│0.01.│0.02.│0.03.│0.04.│0.05.│0.06.│0.07.│0.08.│0.09.\r\n    water   │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │\r\n  standard. │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │\r\n ───────────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────\r\n                     Platinum-cobalt standard color.\r\n        0.00│    0│    2│    4│    6│    8│    9│   11│   13│   15│   17\r\n         .10│   18│   19│   20│   20│   21│   22│   23│   24│   24│   26\r\n         .20│   26│   27│   27│   28│   29│   29│   30│   31│   32│   32\r\n         .30│   33│   34│   34│   35│   35│   36│   37│   37│   38│   38\r\n         .40│   39│   40│   40│   41│   42│   42│   43│   44│   45│   45\r\n         .50│   46│   47│   47│   48│   48│   49│   50│   50│   51│   51\r\n         .60│   52│   53│   53│   54│   54│   55│   56│   56│   57│   57\r\n         .70│   58│   58│   59│   59│   60│   60│   61│   61│   62│   62\r\n         .80│   63│   64│   64│   65│   66│   66│   67│   68│   69│   69\r\n         .90│   70│   71│   72│   73│   74│   75│   77│   78│   79│   80\r\n        1.00│   81│   82│   82│   83│   84│   84│   85│   86│   87│   87\r\n        1.10│   88│   89│   89│   90│   91│   91│   92│   93│   94│   94\r\n        1.20│   95│   96│   96│   97│   98│   98│   99│  100│  101│  101\r\n        1.30│  102│  103│  103│  104│  105│  105│  106│  107│  108│  108\r\n        1.40│  109│  110│  110│  111│  112│  112│  113│  114│  115│  115\r\n        1.50│  116│  117│  117│  118│  118│  119│  120│  120│  121│  121\r\n        1.60│  122│  123│  123│  124│  125│  125│  126│  127│  128│  128\r\n        1.70│  129│  130│  130│  131│  132│  132│  133│  134│  135│  136\r\n        1.80│  136│  137│  137│  138│  139│  139│  140│  141│  142│  142\r\n        1.90│  143│  144│  144│  145│  146│  146│  147│  148│  149│  149\r\n        2.00│  150│     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │\r\n ───────────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────\r\n\r\nFootnote B:\r\n\r\n  Zero on the true Nessler scale is about 15 on the platinum scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          LOVIBOND TINTOMETER.\r\n\r\nThe value of the readings of tint and shade by the Lovibond\r\ntintometer[66][82][83] has not been commensurate with the labor\r\ninvolved, but it is necessary to make a record of the reflected tint and\r\nshade[50] of some waters. The standard color disks used in teaching\r\noptics may be used for the purpose.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—The white disk supports three movable standard color\r\nsectors, red, yellow, and blue, and one movable black sector. All are\r\nmounted on a device which can be revolved rapidly, blending the colors\r\ninto a uniform tint or shade. A scale around the circumference of the\r\ndisk is used to indicate the percentage of each color or white or black\r\nin the blend.\r\n\r\nPlace the sample in a battery jar on a white ground; adjust the sectors\r\nso that when blended the tint or shade will match the reflected tint or\r\nshade of the sample. Report the percentages of red, yellow blue, white,\r\nand black in the blended tint or shade.\r\n\r\n\r\n                ODOR.[4][14][53][72][92][114][115][121c]\r\n\r\nThe observation of the odor, cold and hot, of samples of surface water\r\nis important as the odors are usually indicative of organic growths or\r\nsewage contamination or both. The odor of some ground waters is caused\r\nby the earthy constituents of the water-bearing strata. The odor of a\r\ncontaminated well water is often contributory evidence of its pollution.\r\nA study of the organisms as directed under Microscopical Examination (p.\r\n90) is a valuable adjunct to physical and chemical examination of water.\r\nCertain odors distinguish or identify certain organisms, as, for\r\nexample, the “fishy” odor of _Uroglena_, the “aromatic” or “rose\r\ngeranium” odor of _Asterionella_ and the “pig pen” odor of _Anabaena_.\r\nObserve and record the odor, both at room temperature and at just below\r\nthe boiling point, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                               COLD ODOR.\r\n\r\nShake the sample violently in one of the collecting bottles, when it is\r\nhalf to two-thirds full and when the sample is at room temperature\r\n(about 20° C.).

In some laboratories other forms of expression have been\r\nused. Results expressed in parts per 100,000 or in grains per gallon may\r\nbe transformed to parts per million, or conversely, by the use of the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n         Table 4.—FACTORS FOR TRANSFORMING RESULTS OF ANALYSES.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────\r\n              Unit.             │              Equivalent.\r\n ───────────────────────────────┼─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────\r\n                                │ Grains  │ Grains  │         │\r\n                                │per U.S. │   per   │Parts per│Parts per\r\n                                │ gallon. │Imperial │100,000. │million.\r\n                                │         │ gallon. │         │\r\n ───────────────────────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n 1 grain per U.

If the results show quantities greater than 10 parts per million use\r\nno decimals; record only whole numbers. If the quantities reach hundreds\r\nand thousands of parts record only two significant figures.\r\n\r\n2.

Estimates of ammonia, albuminoid, and nitrite nitrogen alone justify\r\nthe use of three decimals.\r\n\r\n5. If the results of analyses are tabulated ciphers should not be added\r\nat the right of the decimal point to make the column uniform.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FORMS OF NITROGEN.\r\n\r\nNitrogenous organic matter passes through several intermediate compounds\r\nduring its natural decomposition, and that which does not gasify\r\nultimately forms nitrate. Nitrogen in organic matter is determined by\r\nthe Kjeldahl process.[13][14][58] An indication of the amount present is\r\nobtained by the albuminoid nitrogen determination.[14][15][67][106][107]\r\nIt has not been found possible to differentiate the nitrogen in the\r\norganic matter that readily decomposes from that in stable or\r\nnon-putrescible compounds. Decomposition of organic matter produces\r\nnitrogen combined in ammonia, which is the first step between\r\nnitrogenous organic matter and the completely mineralized nitrate.\r\nAmmonia nitrogen may be determined by distillation and Nesslerization or\r\nby direct Nesslerization of the clarified sample. The next step is\r\noxidation to nitrite, and the final step, oxidation to nitrate. It is\r\nrecommended that all forms of nitrogen be reported as the element\r\nnitrogen (N).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           AMMONIA NITROGEN.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods for estimating ammonia nitrogen—distillation and\r\ndirect Nesslerization. Distillation is recommended for most waters and\r\ndirect Nesslerization is recommended for sewages, sewage effluents, and\r\nhighly polluted surface waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n           DETERMINATION BY DISTILLATION.[38][68b][111][121]\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Use a metal or a glass flask connected with a condenser so\r\nthat the distillate may drop from the condenser tube directly into a\r\nNessler tube or a flask. Free the apparatus from ammonia by boiling\r\ndistilled water in it until the distillate shows no trace of ammonia.\r\nAfter this has been done empty the distilling flask and measure into it\r\n500 cc. of the sample, or a smaller portion diluted to 500 cc. with\r\nammonia-free water. If the sample is acid or if the presence of urea is\r\nsuspected add about 0.5 gram of sodium carbonate before distillation.\r\nOmit this if possible as it tends to increase “bumping.” Apply heat so\r\nthat the distillation may proceed at the rate of not more than 10 cc.\r\nnor less than 6 cc. per minute. Collect the distillate in four Nessler\r\ntubes, 50 cc. to each tube, or if the nitrogen is high in a 200 cc.\r\ngraduated flask. These receptacles contain the ammonia nitrogen to be\r\nmeasured as hereafter described.\r\n\r\nUse Nessler tubes of such diameter that the graduation mark is between\r\n20 and 25 cm. above the bottom and of such uniformity of diameter that\r\nthe distance from the bottom to the graduation mark of the longest tube\r\nshall not exceed that of the shortest tube by more than 6 mm. The tubes\r\nmust be of clear white glass with polished bottoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    MEASUREMENT OF AMMONIA NITROGEN.\r\n\r\nThe amount of ammonia in the distillates may be measured either by (1)\r\ncomparison of the Nesslerized distillates with Nesslerized solutions\r\ncontaining known quantities of nitrogen as ammonium chloride, or by (2)\r\ncomparison of the Nesslerized distillates with permanent standard\r\nsolutions in which the colors of Nesslerized standard ammonia solutions\r\nare duplicated by solutions of platinum and cobalt chlorides.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   COMPARISON WITH AMMONIA STANDARDS.\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—1. Ammonia-free water.\r\n\r\n2. Standard ammonium chloride solution. Dissolve 3.82 grams of ammonium\r\nchloride in ammonia-free water and dilute to 1 liter; dilute 10 cc. of\r\nthis to 1 liter with ammonia-free water. One cc. equals 0.00001 gram of\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\n3. Nessler reagent.[8] Dissolve 50 grams of potassium iodide in a\r\nminimum quantity of cold water. Add a saturated solution of mercuric\r\nchloride until a slight precipitate persists permanently. Add 400 cc. of\r\n50 per cent solution of potassium hydroxide, made by dissolving the\r\npotassium hydroxide and allowing it to clarify by sedimentation before\r\nusing. Dilute to 1 liter, allow to settle, and decant. This solution\r\nshould give the required color with ammonia within five minutes after\r\naddition and should not produce a precipitate with small amounts of\r\nammonia within two hours.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Prepare a series of 16 Nessler tubes containing the\r\nfollowing amounts of the standard ammonium chloride solution, diluted to\r\n50 cc. with ammonia-free water, namely: 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0,\r\n1.4, 1.7, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, and 6.0 cc. These solutions\r\nwill contain 0.00001 gram of nitrogen for each cubic centimeter of the\r\nstandard solution.\r\n\r\nNesslerize the standards and the distillates by adding approximately 1\r\ncc. of Nessler reagent to each tube. Do not stir the contents of the\r\ntubes. The temperature of the tubes should be practically the same as\r\nthat of the standards; otherwise the colors will not be directly\r\ncomparable.[45] Allow the tubes to stand at least 10 minutes after\r\nNesslerizing. Compare the color produced in the tubes with that in the\r\nstandards by looking vertically downward through them at a white or\r\nmirrored surface placed at an angle in front of a window so as to\r\nreflect the light upward.\r\n\r\nIf the color obtained by Nesslerizing the distillates is greater than\r\nthat of the darkest tube of the standards, mix the contents of the tube\r\nthoroughly, pour out half of the liquid, and dilute the remainder to the\r\noriginal volume with ammonia-free water; then make the color comparison\r\nand multiply the result by two. If the color is still too dark after\r\npouring out half the liquid, repeat this process of division until a\r\nreading can be made. The process of dilution may be shortened by mixing\r\ntogether the distillates from one sample before making the comparison\r\nand comparing an aliquot portion with the standards.\r\n\r\nAfter the readings have been recorded add the results obtained by\r\nNesslerizing each portion of the entire distillate. If 500 cc. of the\r\nsample is distilled this sum, expressed in cubic centimeters and\r\nmultiplied by 0.02, will give the number of parts per million of ammonia\r\nnitrogen in the sample. If x cc. of sample is used multiply the sum of\r\nthe readings by 10/x.\r\n\r\nIf the ammonia is known to be high the distillate may be collected in\r\n200 cc. flasks and an aliquot part Nesslerized.\r\n\r\n\r\n              COMPARISON WITH PERMANENT STANDARDS.[62][65]\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—Platinum solution. Dissolve 2.00 grams of potassium platinic\r\nchloride (PtCl_{4}.2KCl) in a small amount of distilled water, add 100\r\ncc. of strong hydrochloric acid, and dilute to 1 liter.\r\n\r\nCobalt solution. Dissolve 12 grams of cobaltous chloride\r\n(CoCl_{2}.6H_{2}O) in distilled water, add 100 cc. of strong\r\nhydrochloric acid, and dilute to 1 liter.\r\n\r\nPrepare standards by putting various amounts of these two solutions into\r\nNessler tubes and diluting to the 50 cc. mark with distilled water as\r\nindicated in Table 5. These standards may be kept for several months if\r\nprotected from dust.\r\n\r\n  Table 5.—PREPARATION OF PERMANENT STANDARDS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF\r\n                                AMMONIA.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────┬───────────────────────┬───────────────────────\r\n    Value in standard   │ Solution of platinum. │  Solution of cobalt.\r\n   ammonium chloride.   │                       │\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────────────────\r\n                   _cc._│                  _cc._│                  _cc._\r\n                     0.0│                    1.2│                    0.0\r\n                      .1│                    1.8│                     .0\r\n                      .2│                    2.8│                     .0\r\n                      .4│                    4.7│                     .1\r\n                      .7│                    5.9│                     .2\r\n                        │                       │\r\n                     1.0│                    7.7│                     .5\r\n                     1.4│                    9.9│                    1.1\r\n                     1.7│                   11.4│                    1.7\r\n                     2.0│                   12.7│                    2.2\r\n                     2.5│                   15.0│                    3.3\r\n                        │                       │\r\n                     3.0│                   17.3│                    4.5\r\n                     3.5│                   19.0│                    5.7\r\n                     4.0│                   19.7│                    7.1\r\n                     4.5│                   19.9│                    8.7\r\n                     5.0│                   20.0│                   10.4\r\n                        │                       │\r\n                     6.0│                   20.0│                   15.0\r\n                     7.0│                   20.0│                   22.0\r\n ───────────────────────┴───────────────────────┴───────────────────────\r\n\r\nThe amounts in Table 5 are approximate, and the actual amount necessary\r\nwill differ with the character of the Nessler solution, the color\r\nsensitiveness of the analyst’s eye, and other conditions. The final test\r\nof the standard is best obtained by comparing it with Nesslerized\r\nstandards and modifying the tint accordingly. Such comparison should be\r\nmade for each new batch of Nessler solution and should be checked by\r\neach analyst.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—In comparison with permanent standards, Nesslerize the\r\ndistillates in the manner above described and compare the resulting\r\ncolors at the end of about 10 minutes with the permanent standards. The\r\nmethod of calculating results is precisely the same as with the ammonia\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MODIFICATION FOR SEWAGE.\r\n\r\nAmmonia nitrogen and albuminoid nitrogen in sewages, soils, and other\r\nmaterials of high nitrogen content may be satisfactorily determined by\r\ndiluting the sample with ammonia-free distilled water and proceeding as\r\ndescribed in the preceding sections, but it is permissible to distill\r\nwith steam.[40]\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Use a 200 cc. long-necked Kjeldahl flask connected with a\r\ncondenser so that the distillate may drop from the condenser tube\r\ndirectly into a Nessler tube or a flask. Connect the Kjeldahl flask with\r\na steam generator by a tube reaching almost to the bottom of the flask.\r\n\r\nAfter the apparatus is freed from ammonia put the sample to be tested\r\ninto the flask. Use 10 to 100 cc. of the sample according to its ammonia\r\ncontent. Pass ammonia-free steam through the liquid in the Kjeldahl\r\nflask and collect the distillate in the usual way. It is usually\r\nconvenient to collect the distillate in a 200 cc. flask and to take an\r\naliquot part of it for Nesslerization. Compare with standards and\r\ncalculate the nitrogen content in the usual manner.\r\n\r\nThis method has the advantage, when the sample is treated with an\r\nalkaline solution of potassium permanganate, of avoiding bumping,\r\npermitting the assay of solid matter, and yielding the ammonia more\r\nrapidly than by the ordinary process of distillation.\r\n\r\n\r\n            DETERMINATION BY DIRECT NESSLERIZATION.[21][75]\r\n\r\n _Reagents._— 1. Ten per cent solution of copper sulfate\r\n                (CuSO_{4}.5H_{2}O).\r\n\r\n              2. Ten per cent solution of lead acetate\r\n                (Pb(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{2}.3H_{2}O).\r\n\r\n              3. Fifty per cent solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or\r\n                potassium hydroxide (KOH).\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—To 50 cc. of the sample to be tested, diluted if necessary\r\nwith an equal volume of ammonia-free water, in a short tube, add a few\r\ndrops of the copper sulfate solution. After thoroughly mixing, add 1 cc.\r\nof the alkali hydroxide solution and again thoroughly mix. Allow the\r\ntube to stand for a few minutes, when a heavy precipitate should fall to\r\nthe bottom, leaving a colorless supernatant liquid. Nesslerize an\r\naliquot part. Compare with standards and compute the ammonia nitrogen in\r\nthe same manner as in the distillation procedure.\r\n\r\nSamples containing hydrogen sulfide may require the use of lead acetate\r\nin addition to the copper sulfate. Some samples may require a few trials\r\nbefore the right combination of the three solutions to bring about the\r\nbest results can be found.\r\n\r\nInstead of adding copper sulfate to sewages of high magnesium content\r\nsatisfactory clarification of the sample can be obtained by mixing it\r\nwith the alkali hydroxide alone.[54]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ALBUMINOID NITROGEN.\r\n\r\nThe addition of an alkaline permanganate solution to liquids containing\r\nnitrogenous organic matter causes the formation of ammonia, which can be\r\ndistilled and determined by Nesslerization of the distillate. The\r\nnitrogen of the ammonia, thus obtained, is called albuminoid nitrogen.\r\nAs the ratio of nitrogenous organic matter to the ammonia obtained by\r\ndistillation is decidedly variable[6][30][75] in sewages and other\r\nsubstances containing much nitrogenous organic matter albuminoid\r\nnitrogen results on such substances are less accurate[29] than organic\r\n(Kjeldahl) nitrogen. Therefore in sewage work, including analysis of\r\ninfluents and effluents of purification plants and the water of highly\r\npolluted streams, it is recommended that determinations of organic\r\nnitrogen be substituted for determinations of albuminoid nitrogen. For\r\nground waters and surface waters containing but little pollution, the\r\nalbuminoid nitrogen is approximately one-half the organic nitrogen;\r\naccordingly the continuance of albuminoid nitrogen determinations for\r\nthis class of work is approved.\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—Alkaline potassium permanganate. Pour 1,200 cc. of distilled\r\nwater into a porcelain dish holding 2,500 cc., boil 10 minutes, and turn\r\noff the gas. Add 16 grams of C. P. potassium permanganate and stir until\r\nsolution is complete. Then add 800 cc. of 50 per cent clarified solution\r\nof potassium hydroxide or an equivalent amount of sodium hydroxide and\r\nenough distilled water to fill the dish. Boil down to 2,000 cc. Test\r\nthis solution for ammonia by making a blank determination. Correct\r\ndeterminations by the amount of this blank.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—After the collection of the distillate for ammonia nitrogen\r\ndescribed on page 15 add 50 cc. (or more if necessary to insure the\r\ncomplete oxidation of the organic matter) of alkaline potassium\r\npermanganate and continue the distillation until at least four portions,\r\nand preferably five portions, of 50 cc. each, of distillate have been\r\ncollected in separate tubes. Determine the albuminoid nitrogen in the\r\ndistillate by Nesslerization. If the albuminoid nitrogen is known to be\r\nhigh it is convenient to collect the distillate in a 200 cc. flask and\r\nto Nesslerize an aliquot part of it.\r\n\r\nDissolved albuminoid nitrogen may be determined in a sample from which\r\nsuspended matter has been removed by filtration either through filter\r\npaper or through a Berkefeld filter. Suspended albuminoid nitrogen is\r\nthe difference between the total and the dissolved albuminoid nitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 ORGANIC NITROGEN.[24b][69][71][76][84]\r\n\r\n_Procedure for water._—Boil 500 cc. of the sample in a round-bottomed\r\nflask to remove ammonia nitrogen. This usually causes the loss of 200\r\ncc. of the sample, which may be collected for the determination of\r\nammonia nitrogen. Add 5 cc. of nitrogen-free concentrated sulfuric acid\r\nand a small piece of ignited pumice. Mix by shaking and place over a\r\nflame under a hood. Digest until copious fumes of sulfuric acid are\r\ngiven off and the liquid finally becomes colorless or pale straw color.\r\nRemove from the flame, and add potassium permanganate crystals in small\r\nportions until a heavy green precipitate persists in the liquid. Cool.\r\nDilute to about 300 cc. with ammonia-free water. Make alkaline with 10\r\nper cent ammonia-free sodium hydroxide. Distill the ammonia, collect the\r\ndistillate in Nessler tubes, Nesslerize, and compare with standards as\r\ndescribed (pp. 16–18).\r\n\r\n_First procedure for sewage_[76].—Distill the ammonia nitrogen directly\r\nfrom 100 cc. or less of the sample, diluted to 500 cc. with\r\nnitrogen-free water. Collect the distillate and determine the ammonia\r\nnitrogen in it. Add 5 cc. of nitrogen-free sulfuric acid and 1 cc. of 10\r\nper cent nitrogen-free copper sulfate, and digest the liquid for half an\r\nhour after it has become colorless or pale straw color. Add 0.5 gram of\r\npotassium permanganate crystals to the hot acid solution, and dilute to\r\n500 cc. with ammonia-free water. Dilute 10 cc. or more of this liquid,\r\nin a Kjeldahl distilling flask, to about 300 cc. with ammonia-free\r\nwater. Make alkaline with 10 per cent sodium hydroxide, distill, and\r\nNesslerize. With some samples direct Nesslerization may be used. (See p.\r\n19.)\r\n\r\nIn this determination care must be taken to digest thoroughly, to add\r\npotassium permanganate to the point of precipitation, to sample\r\ncarefully after dilution, and to add enough sodium hydroxide to insure\r\nthe separation of the ammonia from the precipitated manganese hydroxide.\r\nPotassium permanganate should not be added during digestion because it\r\ncauses loss of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n_Second procedure for sewage._—Omit the separation of ammonia nitrogen\r\nand determine the ammonia nitrogen and organic nitrogen together.\r\nDetermine the ammonia nitrogen in a separate sample by direct\r\nNesslerization as described on page 19. The organic nitrogen is equal to\r\nthe difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n                NITRITE NITROGEN.[51][63a][64][94c][108]\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—1. Sulfanilic acid solution. Dissolve 8.00 grams of the\r\npurest sulfanilic acid in 1,000 cc. of 5 N acetic acid (sp. gr. 1.041)\r\nor in 1,000 cc. of water containing 50 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric\r\nacid. This is practically a saturated solution.\r\n\r\n2. α-naphthylamine acetate or chloride solution. Dissolve 5.00 grams\r\nsolid α-naphthylamine in 1,000 cc. of 5 N acetic acid or in 1,000 cc. of\r\nwater containing 8 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Filter the\r\nsolution through washed absorbent cotton or an alundum filter.\r\n\r\n3. Sodium nitrite stock solution. Dissolve 1.1 gram silver nitrite in\r\nnitrite-free water; precipitate the silver with sodium chloride solution\r\nand dilute the whole to 1 liter.\r\n\r\n4. Standard sodium nitrite solution. Dilute 100 cc. of solution 3 to 1\r\nliter, then dilute 50 cc. of this solution to 1 liter with sterilized\r\nnitrite-free water, add 1 cc. of chloroform, and preserve in a\r\nsterilized bottle. One cc. = 0.0005 mg. nitrogen.\r\n\r\n5. Fuchsine solution. 0.1 gram per liter.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Place in a standard Nessler tube 50 cc. of the sample,\r\ndecolorized if necessary with nitrite-free aluminium hydroxide (see p.\r\n42) or a smaller amount diluted to 50 cc. At the same time prepare in\r\nNessler tubes a set of standards, by diluting to 50 cc. with\r\nnitrite-free water, various amounts of the standard nitrite solution.\r\nThe following amounts of standard solution are suggested: 0.0, 0.1, 0.2,\r\n0.4, 0.7, 1.0, 1.4, 1.7, 2.0, and 2.5 cc. Add 1 cc. of the sulfanilic\r\nacid solution and 1 cc. of the α-naphthylamine acetate or hydrochloride\r\nsolution to the sample and to each standard. Mix thoroughly and allow to\r\nstand 10 minutes; then compare the sample with the standards. Do not\r\nallow the sample to stand more than one-half hour before making the\r\ncomparison. If the color of the sample is deeper than that of the\r\nhighest standard repeat the test on a diluted sample. If 50 cc. of the\r\nsample is used 0.01 times the number of cc. of the standard matched\r\nequals parts per million of nitrite nitrogen. Satisfactory results can\r\nbe obtained by using either hydrochloric or acetic acid in preparing the\r\ntest solutions, but the speed of the reaction is more rapid if acetic\r\nacid is used.[112]\r\n\r\nPermanent standards may be prepared by matching the nitrite standards\r\nwith dilutions of the fuchsine solution. Fuchsine standards have been\r\nfound to be sufficiently accurate for waters high in nitrite and for\r\nsewage. The standards should be checked once a month and kept out of\r\nbright sunlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   NITRATE NITROGEN.[16][36][90][100]\r\n\r\nTwo methods are recommended for the determination of nitrate nitrogen in\r\nwater, sewage, and sewage effluents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                PHENOLDISULFONIC ACID METHOD.[1][5][32]\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—1. Phenoldisulfonic acid. Dissolve 25 grams of pure white\r\nphenol in 150 cc. of pure concentrated sulfuric acid. Add 75 cc. of\r\nfuming sulfuric acid (15 per cent SO_{3}), stir well, and heat for 2\r\nhours at about 100°C.\r\n\r\n2. Potassium hydroxide solution. Prepare an approximately 12 N solution,\r\n10 cc. of which will neutralize about 4 cc. of the phenoldisulfonic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n3. Standard nitrate solution. Dissolve 0.72 gram of pure recrystallized\r\npotassium nitrate in 1 liter of distilled water. Evaporate cautiously to\r\ndryness 10 cc. of the solution on the water bath. Moisten residue\r\nquickly and thoroughly with 2 cc. of phenoldisulfonic acid and dilute to\r\n1 liter. This is the standard solution, 1 cc. of which equals 0.001 mg.\r\nof nitrate nitrogen.\r\n\r\n4. Standard silver sulfate solution. Dissolve 4.4 grams of silver\r\nsulfate free from nitrate in 1 liter of water. One cc. of this solution\r\nis equal to 1 mg. of chloride.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—The alkalinity, chloride, and nitrite content, and color of\r\nthe sample must first be determined. If the sample is highly colored\r\ndecolorize it with freshly precipitated aluminium hydroxide. Measure\r\ninto an evaporating dish 100 cc. of the sample, or if nitrate is very\r\nhigh such volume as will contain about 0.01 mg. of nitrate nitrogen. Add\r\nsufficient N/50 sulfuric acid nearly to neutralize the alkalinity. Then\r\nadd sufficient standard silver sulfate to precipitate all but about 0.1\r\nmg. of chloride. The removal of chloride may be omitted if the sample\r\ncontains less than 30 parts per million of chloride. Heat the mixture to\r\nboiling, add a little aluminium hydroxide, stir, filter, and wash with\r\nsmall amounts of hot water. Evaporate the filtrate to dryness, and add 2\r\ncc. of the phenoldisulfonic acid, rubbing with a glass rod to insure\r\nintimate contact. If the residue becomes packed or appears vitreous\r\nbecause of the presence of much iron, heat the dish on the water bath\r\nfor a few minutes. Dilute the mixture with distilled water, and add\r\nslowly a strong solution of potassium hydroxide or ammonium hydroxide\r\nuntil the maximum color is developed. Transfer the solution to a Nessler\r\ntube, filtering if necessary. If nitrate is present a yellow color will\r\nbe formed. Compare the color with that of standards[52][55] made by\r\nadding 2 cc. of strong potassium hydroxide or ammonium hydroxide to\r\nvarious amounts of standard nitrate solution and diluting them to 50 cc.\r\nin Nessler tubes. The following amounts of standard nitrate solution are\r\nsuggested: 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, and\r\n40.0 cc. These standards may be kept several weeks without\r\ndeterioration. If 100 cc. of water is used the number of cubic\r\ncentimeters of the standard multiplied by 0.01 is equal to parts per\r\nmillion of nitrate nitrogen.\r\n\r\nStandards that will remain permanent for several years if stored in the\r\ndark may be prepared from tripotassium nitrophenoldisulfonate.[5]\r\n\r\nIf nitrite nitrogen is present in excess of 1 part per million it should\r\nbe oxidized by heating the samples a few minutes with a few drops of\r\nhydrogen peroxide free from nitrate repeatedly added[95] or by adding\r\ndilute potassium permanganate in the cold until a faint pink coloration\r\nappears; the nitrogen equivalent of the nitrite thus oxidized to nitrate\r\nis then subtracted from the final nitrate nitrogen reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        REDUCTION METHOD.[2][46]\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—1. Sodium or potassium hydroxide solution. Dissolve 250\r\ngrams of the hydroxide in 1.25 liters of distilled water. Add several\r\nstrips of aluminium foil and allow the evolution of hydrogen to continue\r\nover night. Concentrate the solution to 1 liter by boiling.\r\n\r\n2. Aluminium foil. Use strips of pure aluminium about 10 cm. long, 6 mm.\r\nwide, and 0.33 mm. thick and weighing about 0.5 gram.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—To 100 cc. of the sample in a 300 cc. casserole add 2 cc.\r\nof the hydroxide solution and concentrate by boiling to about 20 cc.\r\nPour the contents of the casserole into a test tube about 16 cm. long\r\nand 3 cm. in diameter, or of approximately 100 cc. capacity. Rinse the\r\ncasserole several times with nitrogen-free water and add the rinse water\r\nto the liquid already in the tube, thus making the contents of the tube\r\napproximately 75 cc. Add a strip of aluminium foil. Close the tube by\r\nmeans of a rubber stopper through which passes a bent glass tube about 5\r\nmm. in diameter. Put the shorter arm of the tube flush with the lower\r\nside of the rubber stopper and let the longer arm extend below the\r\nsurface of distilled water in another test tube. This apparatus serves\r\nas a trap through which the evolved hydrogen escapes freely. The small\r\namount of ammonia escaping into the trap may be neglected. Allow the\r\naction to proceed for a minimum period of four hours or over night. Pour\r\nthe contents of the tube into a distilling flask, dilute with 250 cc. of\r\nammonia-free water, distill, collect the distillate in Nessler tubes,\r\nand Nesslerize. If the nitrate content is high collect the distillate in\r\na 200 cc. flask and Nesslerize an aliquot part. If the supernatant\r\nliquid in the reduction tube is clear and colorless the solution may be\r\ndiluted to a definite volume and an aliquot part Nesslerized without\r\ndistillation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TOTAL NITROGEN.[93]\r\n\r\nIn sewage work it is frequently of assistance to know the total nitrogen\r\ncontent. This is ordinarily computed by adding together the organic,\r\nammonia, nitrite, and nitrate nitrogen, each of which is determined as\r\nalready described.\r\n\r\n\r\n            OXYGEN CONSUMED.[24][67][84a][85][94f][101][102]\r\n\r\nOxygen consumed means the oxygen that the oxidizable compounds of sewage\r\nand water consume when treated in an acid solution with potassium\r\npermanganate. The expression is synonymous with oxygen required, oxygen\r\nabsorbed, and oxygen-consuming capacity. It should not be confused with\r\nbiochemical oxygen demand.\r\n\r\nAs the carbon, not the nitrogen, in organic matter is oxidized by\r\npotassium permanganate, oxygen consumed is considered by some an\r\nindication of the amount of carbonaceous organic matter present. The\r\ndetermination indicates, however, only part of the carbon, the\r\nproportion varying in different samples because the carbon in\r\nnitrogenous matter is not so readily oxidized as that in carbonaceous\r\norganic matter. Furthermore, it does not directly differentiate the\r\ncarbon present in unstable organic matter from that in fairly stable\r\norganic matter, such as is sometimes referred to as residual humus\r\nmatter. As nitrite nitrogen, ferrous iron, sulfide, and other oxidizable\r\nmineral substances reduce potassium permanganate, corrections for them\r\nshould be made in the determination.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          RECOMMENDED METHOD.\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—1. Dilute sulfuric acid. Dilute 1 part of concentrated\r\nsulfuric acid with 3 parts of distilled water and free the solution from\r\noxidizable matter by adding potassium permanganate until a faint pink\r\ncolor persists after the solution has stood several hours.\r\n\r\n2. Standard ammonium oxalate. Dissolve 0.888 gram of the pure salt in 1\r\nliter of distilled water. One cc. is equivalent to 0.1 mg. of oxygen. An\r\nequivalent quantity of oxalic acid or sodium oxalate may be used.\r\n\r\n3. Standard potassium permanganate. Dissolve 0.4 gram of the\r\ncrystallized salt in 1 liter of distilled water. Add 10 cc. of the\r\ndilute sulfuric acid and 10 cc. of this solution of potassium\r\npermanganate to 100 cc. of distilled water, and digest 30 minutes. Add\r\n10 cc. of the ammonium oxalate solution, and then add potassium\r\npermanganate till a pink coloration appears. This destroys the\r\noxygen-consuming capacity of the water used. Now add another 10 cc. of\r\nammonium oxalate solution and titrate with potassium permanganate.\r\nAdjust the potassium permanganate solution so that 1 cc. is equivalent\r\nto 1 cc. of ammonium oxalate solution or 0.1 mg. of available oxygen.\r\n\r\n_Acid digestion._—Place in a flask 100 cc. of the water, or, if the\r\nwater is of high organic content, a smaller portion diluted to 100 cc.\r\nAdd 10 cc. of sulfuric acid solution and 10 cc. of standard potassium\r\npermanganate and digest the liquid exactly 30 minutes in a bath of\r\nboiling water the level of which is kept above the level of the contents\r\nof the flask.[70][71a] If the quantity of permanganate is insufficient\r\nfor complete oxidation repeat the digestion with a larger quantity; at\r\nleast 5 cc. excess of the standard permanganate should be present when\r\nthe ammonium oxalate solution is added. Remove the flask, add 10 cc. of\r\nthe ammonium oxalate solution, and titrate with the standard\r\npermanganate until a faint but distinct color is obtained. If 100 cc. of\r\nwater is used the number of cubic centimeters of potassium permanganate\r\nsolution in excess of the number of cubic centimeters of ammonium\r\noxalate solution is equal to parts per million of oxygen consumed.\r\n\r\nIf oxidizable mineral substances, such as ferrous iron, sulfide, or\r\nnitrite, are present in the sample corrections should be applied as\r\naccurately as possible by suitable procedures. Direct titration of the\r\nacidified sample in the cold, using a three-minute period of digestion,\r\nserves this purpose quite well for polluted surface waters and fairly\r\nwell for purified sewage effluents. Few raw sewages containing no trade\r\nwastes need such a correction, but raw sewages containing “pickling”\r\nliquors do need it. If the sample contains both oxidizable mineral\r\ncompounds and gaseous organic substances the latter should be driven off\r\nby heat and the sample allowed to cool before applying this test for the\r\ncorrection factor. If such corrections are made the fact should be\r\nstated with the amount of correction.\r\n\r\n_Period and temperature of digestion._—As the practice in regard to the\r\nperiod and temperature of digestion has varied widely it is difficult to\r\ncompare the results obtained at one laboratory with those obtained at\r\nanother. None of the methods gives absolute results. They are all\r\nrelative[26][29][57] at best. Digesting 30 minutes at the boiling\r\ntemperature is herein designated the recommended method. If samples are\r\nanalyzed by any other method the method should be noted, and,\r\nrepresentative results by the standard method should be placed on record\r\nfor purposes of comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             OTHER METHODS.\r\n\r\n_Additional reagents._—1. Potassium iodide solution. Ten per cent\r\nsolution, free from iodate.\r\n\r\n2. Standard sodium thiosulfate. Dissolve 1.0 gram of the pure\r\ncrystallized salt in 1 liter of distilled water. Standardize this\r\nsolution against the standard potassium permanganate. As the thiosulfate\r\nsolution does not keep well determine its actual strength at frequent\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\n3. Starch indicator. Prepare as directed in the section on dissolved\r\noxygen (pp. 65–66).\r\n\r\n4. Sodium hydroxide solution. Dissolve 1 part of pure sodium hydroxide\r\nin 2 parts of distilled water.\r\n\r\nCertain widely practiced deviations from the standard procedure just\r\ndescribed are noted in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\n1. Heat the acidified sample to boiling, add the permanganate solution,\r\nand digest for two minutes[16] at boiling temperature. This procedure is\r\nfacilitated by agitating the liquid constantly with a small current of\r\nair to guard against bumping.\r\n\r\n2. Same method as No. 1 except that the period of digestion is five\r\nminutes.[121a]\r\n\r\n3. Same method as No. 2 except that the permanganate solution is added\r\nto the acidified sample when cold, and digestion is continued five\r\nminutes after the sample reaches the boiling point. The advantage of\r\nthis method is that there is included the oxygen-consuming power of the\r\nvolatile matter present in some sewages and sewage effluents, which is\r\ndriven off by heat and thus escapes when the test is made in accordance\r\nwith procedures 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n4. Same method as No. 3 except that the period of digestion is 10\r\nminutes.[63][68c]\r\n\r\n5. Digestion of the sample after the acid and permanganate solutions are\r\nadded is carried out abroad, especially in England, at approximately the\r\nroom temperature,[24a][69a][94f][100a] apparently to guard against\r\ndecomposition[17] of permanganate in the presence of high chloride, for\r\nperiods of three minutes, fifteen minutes, and four hours; many\r\nobservers record the oxygen consumed after all three periods, while some\r\nrecord the result only for the four-hour period. At the end of the\r\nperiod of digestion, add 0.5 cc. of potassium iodide solution to\r\ndischarge the pink color; mix; titrate the liberated iodine with\r\nthiosulfate until the yellow color is nearly destroyed, then add a few\r\ndrops of starch solution and continue titration until the blue color is\r\njust discharged. The number of cubic centimeters of potassium\r\npermanganate solution in excess of the number of cubic centimeters of\r\nsodium thiosulfate solution is equal to parts per million of oxygen\r\nconsumed.\r\n\r\n6. Digestion in alkaline solution[104] is preferable to digestion in\r\nacid solution for brines or waters high in chlorine. Place in a flask\r\n100 cc. of the sample, or if it is of high organic content a smaller\r\nportion diluted to 100 cc. Add 0.5 cc. of sodium hydroxide solution and\r\n10 cc. of standard potassium permanganate and digest exactly 30 minutes.\r\nRemove the flask, add 5 cc. of sulfuric acid and 10 cc. of the standard\r\nammonium oxalate, and titrate with the standard potassium permanganate\r\nas in the acid digestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        RESIDUE ON EVAPORATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TOTAL RESIDUE.[16]\r\n\r\nIgnite and weigh a clean platinum dish, and measure into it 100 cc. of\r\nthe thoroughly shaken sample. Evaporate to dryness on a water bath. Then\r\nheat the dish in an oven at 103° C. or 180° C. for one hour. Cool in a\r\ndesiccator and weigh. The temperature of drying should be mentioned in\r\nthe report. The increase in weight gives the total solids or residue on\r\nevaporation. If 100 cc. of the sample was taken this weight expressed in\r\nmilligrams and multiplied by 10 is equal to parts per million of residue\r\non evaporation. The residue from waters low in organic matter but\r\nrelatively high in iron may be used, as a matter of convenience, for the\r\ndetermination of iron.\r\n\r\n\r\n              FIXED RESIDUE AND LOSS ON IGNITION.[13][96]\r\n\r\nThe residue from sewages and waters high in organic matter may be\r\nignited to burn off the organic matter, which, with some volatile\r\ninorganic matter, constitutes the loss on ignition.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Ignite the residue in the platinum dish at a low red heat.\r\nIf great accuracy is desired this should be done in an electric muffle\r\nfurnace or in a radiator, which consists of a platinum or a nickel dish\r\nlarge enough to allow an air space of about half an inch between it and\r\nthe dish within it, the inner dish being supported by a triangle of\r\nplatinum wire laid on the bottom of the outer dish. A disc of platinum\r\nor nickel foil large enough to cover the outer dish is suspended over\r\nthe inner dish to radiate the heat into it. The larger dish is heated to\r\nbright redness until the residue is white or nearly so. Allow the dish\r\nto cool, and moisten the residue with a few drops of distilled water.\r\nDry the residue in the oven, cool in a desiccator, and weigh. The fixed\r\nresidue on evaporation is the difference between this weight and the\r\nweight of the dish.\r\n\r\nThe loss on ignition is the difference between the total residue on\r\nevaporation and the fixed residue on evaporation.\r\n\r\nIf the odor and color on ignition of some residues give helpful clues to\r\nthe character of the organic matter record them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SUSPENDED MATTER.[56][110]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   DETERMINATION WITH GOOCH CRUCIBLE.\r\n\r\n_Reagent._—Prepare a dilute cream of asbestos fibre which has been\r\nfinely shredded, thoroughly ignited, treated with strong hydrochloric\r\nacid for at least 12 hours, and washed with distilled water till free\r\nfrom acid.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—1. Prepare a mat of the asbestos fibre 1/16 inch thick in a\r\nGooch crucible. Dry it in an oven at 103 or 180° C., cool and weigh.\r\nFilter 1,000 cc. of samples having a turbidity of 50 parts per million\r\nor less. If the turbidity is higher use sufficient water to obtain 50 to\r\n100 mg. of suspended matter. Dry for one hour at 103 or 180° C., cool\r\nand weigh. Report the temperature at which the residue was dried. If\r\n1,000 cc. is filtered the increase in weight expressed in milligrams is\r\nequal to parts per million of suspended matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      DETERMINATION BY FILTRATION.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the total solids in filtered and unfiltered\r\nportions of a sample may be used as a basis for calculating suspended\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        DETERMINATION OF VOLUME.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the volume[9][69b] of suspended matter in sewages\r\nhas received considerable attention abroad. Imhoff recommends the use of\r\nconical glass vessels holding 1 liter with the lower portions graduated\r\nin cubic centimeters. Others recommend centrifuges with sediment tubes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  FIXED RESIDUE AND LOSS ON IGNITION.\r\n\r\nTreat the total residue from a filtered sample in the same manner as\r\ndescribed for the total residue, and obtain the loss on ignition due to\r\ndissolved matter, and by difference the loss on ignition due to\r\nsuspended matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HARDNESS.[94e]\r\n\r\nA water containing certain mineral constituents in solution, chiefly\r\ncalcium and magnesium, which form insoluble compounds with soap, is said\r\nto be hard. Carbon dioxide in water increases the solubility of calcium\r\nand magnesium carbonates, forming bicarbonate. If carbon dioxide is\r\nremoved from the water by boiling the bicarbonate is decomposed and\r\ncalcium and magnesium are partly precipitated. The proportion of calcium\r\nor magnesium carbonate that a water can hold in solution depends on the\r\nconcentration of carbon dioxide, which in turn depends on the\r\ntemperature of the water and the proportion of carbon dioxide in the\r\natmosphere with which the water has been in contact. Consequently, when\r\nthe carbon dioxide is removed from the water by boiling or otherwise the\r\ncarbonates of calcium and magnesium are partly, but not completely,\r\nprecipitated, and the hardness of the water is thus diminished and the\r\nwater is softened to the extent to which these substances are\r\nprecipitated. The hardness thus removed is called temporary hardness.\r\nThe hardness which still remains after boiling is due mainly to calcium\r\nand magnesium in equilibrium with sulfate, chloride, and nitrate, and\r\nresidual carbonate, and it is called permanent hardness. Non-carbonate\r\nhardness is the hardness caused by sulfates, chlorides, and nitrates of\r\ncalcium, magnesium, iron, and other metals that form insoluble soaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     TOTAL HARDNESS BY CALCULATION.\r\n\r\nThe most accurate method of ascertaining total hardness is to compute it\r\nfrom the results of determinations of calcium and magnesium in the\r\nsample. (See methods, pp. 57–58.) Iron and other metals must be included\r\nin the calculation if they are present in significant amounts. Total\r\nhardness as CaCO_{3} equals 2.5 Ca plus 4.1 Mg.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  TOTAL HARDNESS BY SOAP METHOD.[121b]\r\n\r\nThe determination of hardness by the soap method roughly approximates\r\nthe amount of calcium and magnesium in a water, though it actually\r\nmeasures the soap-consuming power of the water.\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—1. Standard calcium chloride solution. Dissolve 0.2 gram of\r\npure calcite (calcium carbonate) in a little dilute hydrochloric acid,\r\nbeing careful to avoid loss of solution by spattering. Evaporate the\r\nsolution to dryness several times with distilled water to expel excess\r\nof acid. Dissolve the residue in distilled water and dilute the solution\r\nto 1 liter. One cc. of this dilution is equivalent to 0.2 mg. of calcium\r\ncarbonate.\r\n\r\n2. Standard soap solution. Dissolve 100 grams of dry white Castile soap\r\nin 1 liter of 80 per cent alcohol, and allow this solution to stand\r\nseveral days before standardizing. Pure potassium oleate made from lead\r\nplaster and potassium carbonate may be used in place of Castile soap.\r\n\r\n_First method of standardization._—Dilute 20 cc. of the calcium chloride\r\nsolution in a 250 cc. glass-stoppered bottle to 50 cc. with distilled\r\nwater which has been recently boiled and cooled. Add soap solution from\r\na burette, 0.2 or 0.3 cc. at a time, shaking the bottle vigorously after\r\neach addition until a lather remains unbroken for five minutes over the\r\nentire surface of the water while the bottle lies on its side. Then\r\nadjust the strength of the stock solution with 70 per cent alcohol so\r\nthat the resulting diluted soap solution will give a permanent lather\r\nwhen 6.40 cc. of it is properly added to 20 cc. of standard calcium\r\nchloride solution diluted to 50 cc. Usually 75 to 100 cc. of the stock\r\nsoap solution is required to make 1 liter of the standard soap solution.\r\nThe quantity of calcium carbonate equivalent to each cubic centimeter of\r\nthe standard soap solution consumed in the titration is indicated in\r\nTable 6.\r\n\r\n Table 6.—TOTAL HARDNESS IN PARTS PER MILLION OF CaCO_{3} FOR EACH TENTH\r\n   OF A CUBIC CENTIMETER OF SOAP SOLUTION WHEN 50 CC.

This dilute solution\r\nshould be of such strength that approximately 6.4 cc. of it will give a\r\npermanent lather when 20 cc. of standard calcium chloride solution\r\ndiluted to 50 cc. with distilled water is titrated with it. Determine\r\nthe amount of soap solution required to give a permanent lather with 50\r\ncc. of distilled water and with 5, 10, 15, and 20 cc. of standard\r\ncalcium chloride solution diluted to 50 cc. with distilled water.\r\nFinally plot on cross-section paper a curve showing the relation of\r\nvarious quantities of soap solution to corresponding quantities of\r\nstandard calcium carbonate solution and therefore to parts per million\r\nof hardness.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Measure 50 cc. of the water into a 250 cc. bottle and add\r\nto it soap solution in small quantities in precisely the same manner as\r\ndescribed under the standardization of the soap solution. From the\r\nnumber of cubic centimeters of soap solution used obtain from Table 6 or\r\nfrom the plotted curve the total hardness of the water in parts per\r\nmillion of calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\nTo avoid mistaking the false or magnesium end-point for the true one[35]\r\nwhen adding the soap solution to waters containing magnesium salts, read\r\nthe burette after the titration is apparently finished, and add about\r\n0.5 cc. more of soap solution. If the end-point was due to magnesium the\r\nlather will disappear. Soap solution must then be added until the true\r\nend-point is reached. Usually the false lather persists for less than\r\nfive minutes.\r\n\r\nIf more than 7 cc. of soap solution is required for 50 cc. of the water\r\ntake less of the sample and dilute it to 50 cc. with distilled water\r\nwhich has been recently boiled and cooled. This step reduces somewhat\r\nthe disturbing influence of magnesium,[107a] which consumes more soap\r\nthan an equivalent weight of calcium.\r\n\r\nAt best the soap method is not a precise test on account of the\r\ndifferent relative amounts of calcium and magnesium in different waters.\r\nFor hard waters, especially in connection with processes for\r\npurification and softening, it is advised that this method be not\r\nexclusively used. If the same water is frequently analyzed it may be of\r\nassistance to standardize the soap solution against a mixture of calcium\r\nand magnesium salts, the relative proportions of which approximate those\r\nfound in the water.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the soap solution should be determined from time to\r\ntime, to make sure that it has not materially changed. Record all\r\nresults in parts per million of calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\nOne English degree of hardness, Clark’s scale, is equivalent to 1 grain\r\nper Imperial gallon of calcium carbonate. One French degree of hardness\r\nis equivalent to 1 part per 100,000 of calcium carbonate. One German\r\ndegree of hardness is equivalent to 1 part per 100,000 of calcium oxide,\r\nand multiplied by 17.9 gives parts per million of calcium carbonate. The\r\nrelations of these various scales are indicated in Table 7.\r\n\r\n                 Table 7.—CONVERSION TABLE FOR HARDNESS.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────\r\n            Unit.           │                Equivalent.\r\n ───────────────────────────┼──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────\r\n                            │Parts per │  Clark   │  French  │  German\r\n                            │ million. │ degrees. │ degrees. │ degrees.\r\n ───────────────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n One part per million       │      1.00│      0.07│      0.10│     0.056\r\n One Clark degree           │      14.3│      1.00│      1.43│       .80\r\n One French degree          │      10.0│       .70│      1.00│       .56\r\n One German degree          │      17.9│      1.24│      1.78│      1.00\r\n ───────────────────────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────\r\n\r\n\r\n        TOTAL HARDNESS BY SODA REAGENT METHOD.[47][74][81][94d]\r\n\r\nAdd standard sulfuric acid to 200 cc. of the sample until the alkalinity\r\nis neutralized. (See Procedure with methyl orange, p. 37.) Then apply\r\nthe non-carbonate hardness method (pp. 34–35). This method gives fairly\r\nsatisfactory estimates of total hardness of hard waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n               TEMPORARY HARDNESS BY TITRATION WITH ACID.\r\n\r\nDetermine the alkalinity in presence of methyl orange (see p. 37) in the\r\noriginal sample and also in the sample after boiling, cooling, restoring\r\nto the original volume with boiled distilled water, and filtering. The\r\ndifference between the two, if any, is the temporary hardness. This is\r\nthe most accurate method of determining the temporary hardness of\r\nordinary waters. Iron bicarbonate is included as a part of the temporary\r\nhardness.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NON-CARBONATE HARDNESS BY SODA REAGENT METHOD.[47][74][81][94d]\r\n\r\nThe use of soda reagent does not avoid entirely the error due to\r\nsolubility of the salts of calcium and magnesium; consequently, if much\r\ndepends on the results, as in water softening, gravimetric\r\ndeterminations of the calcium and magnesium that remain in solution\r\nshould be made and a correction should be applied for those amounts.\r\n\r\n_Reagent._—Prepare soda reagent from equal parts of sodium hydroxide and\r\nsodium carbonate. It should be approximately tenth normal.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Measure 200 cc. of the sample and 200 cc. of distilled\r\nwater into 500 cc. Jena or similar glass Erlenmeyer flasks. Treat the\r\ncontents of each flask in the following manner. Boil 15 minutes to expel\r\nfree carbon dioxide. Add 25 cc. of soda reagent. Boil 10 minutes, cool,\r\nrinse into 200 cc. graduated flasks, and dilute to 200 cc. with boiled\r\ndistilled water. Filter, rejecting the first 50 cc., and titrate 50 cc.\r\nof each filtrate with N/50 sulfuric acid in the presence of methyl\r\norange or erythrosine indicator. The non-carbonate hardness in parts per\r\nmillion of calcium carbonate is equal to 20 times the difference between\r\nthe number of cubic centimeters of sulfuric acid required for the soda\r\nreagent in distilled water and the number of cubic centimeters of N/50\r\nsulfuric acid required for the soda reagent in the sample.\r\n\r\nWater naturally containing bicarbonate and carbonate in excess of\r\ncalcium and magnesium requires a larger amount of acid to neutralize the\r\nsample after it has been treated than is required to neutralize the\r\nvolume of soda reagent originally added. (See p. 39.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                 NON-CARBONATE HARDNESS BY SOAP METHOD.\r\n\r\nNon-carbonate hardness may be calculated for waters which are soft or\r\nmoderately hard in a fairly satisfactory manner by deducting the total\r\nalkalinity from the total hardness by the soap method (pp. 31–34). For\r\nwaters that are very hard, and particularly those that contain much\r\nmagnesium, this method is not advised.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ALKALINITY.[11][18][47][97]\r\n\r\nThe alkalinity of a natural water represents its content of carbonate,\r\nbicarbonate, borate, silicate, phosphate, and hydroxide. Alkalinity is\r\ndetermined by neutralization with standard sulfuric acid or potassium\r\nbisulfate in the presence of phenolphthalein and either methyl orange,\r\nerythrosine, or lacmoid as indicators. Methyl orange may be used except\r\nin waters containing aluminium sulfate or iron sulfate. The relations\r\nbetween estimates in presence of these indicators and the carbonate,\r\nbicarbonate, and hydroxide radicles are indicated in Table 8. The\r\nalkalinity of carbonates in the presence of phenolphthalein is different\r\nfrom that in the presence of methyl orange, partly because of loss of\r\ncarbon dioxide and partly because of defects in phenolphthalein as an\r\nindicator in such conditions.\r\n\r\n  Table 8.—RELATIONS BETWEEN ALKALINITY TO PHENOLPHTHALEIN AND THAT TO\r\n   METHYL ORANGE, ERYTHROSINE, OR LACMOID, IN PRESENCE OF BICARBONATE,\r\n                        CARBONATE, AND HYDROXIDE.\r\n\r\n ─────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n     Result of    │   Value of radicle expressed in terms of calcium\r\n   titration.[C]  │                     carbonate.\r\n ─────────────────┼─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────\r\n                  │  Bicarbonate.   │   Carbonate.    │   Hydroxide.\r\n ─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────\r\n P = 0            │        T        │        0        │        0\r\n P < 1/2T         │     T − 2P      │       2P        │        0\r\n P = 1/2T         │        0        │       2P        │        0\r\n P > 1/2T         │        0        │    2(T − P)     │     2P − T\r\n P = T            │        0        │        0        │        T\r\n ─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────\r\n\r\nFootnote C:\r\n\r\n  T = Total alkalinity in presence of methyl orange, erythrosine, or\r\n  lacmoid.

Dissolve 5 grams of a good quality of\r\nphenolphthalein in 1 liter of 50 per cent alcohol. Neutralize with N/10\r\npotassium hydroxide. The alcohol should be diluted with boiled distilled\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n3. Methyl orange indicator. Dissolve 0.5 gram of a good grade of methyl\r\norange in 1 liter of distilled water. Keep the solution in the dark.\r\n\r\n4. Lacmoid indicator. Dissolve 2.0 grams of lacmoid in 1 liter of 50 per\r\ncent alcohol. Dilute the alcohol with freshly boiled distilled water.\r\n\r\n5. Erythrosine indicator. Dissolve 0.5 gram of erythrosine (the sodium\r\nsalt) in 1 liter of freshly boiled distilled water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PROCEDURE WITH PHENOLPHTHALEIN.\r\n\r\nAdd 4 drops of phenolphthalein indicator to 50 or 100 cc. of the sample\r\nin a white porcelain casserole or an Erlenmeyer flask over a white\r\nsurface. If the solution becomes colored, hydroxide or normal carbonate\r\nis present. Add N/50 sulfuric acid from a burette until the coloration\r\ndisappears.\r\n\r\nThe phenolphthalein alkalinity in parts per million of calcium carbonate\r\nis equal to the number of cubic centimeters of N/50 sulfuric acid used\r\nmultiplied by 20 if 50 cc. of the sample was used, or by 10 if 100 cc.\r\nwas used.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     PROCEDURE WITH METHYL ORANGE.\r\n\r\nAdd 2 drops of methyl orange indicator to 50 or 100 cc. of the sample,\r\nor to the solution to which phenolphthalein has been added, in a white\r\nporcelain casserole or an Erlenmeyer flask over a white surface. If the\r\nsolution becomes yellow, hydroxide, normal carbonate, or bicarbonate is\r\npresent. Add N/50 sulfuric acid from a burette until the faintest pink\r\ncoloration appears. The methyl orange alkalinity in parts per million of\r\ncalcium carbonate is equal to the total number of cubic centimeters of\r\nN/50 sulfuric acid used multiplied by 20 if 50 cc. of the sample was\r\nused, or by 10 if 100 cc. was used.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PROCEDURE WITH LACMOID.\r\n\r\nAdd 4 drops of lacmoid indicator to 50 or 100 cc. of the sample in a\r\nporcelain casserole or an Erlenmeyer flask. Add N/50 sulfuric acid from\r\na burette until within 1 or 2 cc. of the amount necessary for\r\nneutralization has been added. Heat the solution until bubbles of steam\r\nbegin to break at the surface. Remove the dish from the source of heat\r\nand continue the titration until a drop of the acid striking the surface\r\nof the liquid and sinking to the bottom of the vessel produces no change\r\nin the uniform reddish or purple color of the solution. The calculation\r\nis the same as for phenolphthalein alkalinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PROCEDURE WITH ERYTHROSINE.\r\n\r\nAdd 5 cc. of neutral chloroform and 1 cc. of erythrosine indicator to 50\r\nor 100 cc. of the sample in a 250 cc. clear glass-stoppered bottle. If\r\nthe chloroform becomes rose colored on shaking, hydroxide, bicarbonate,\r\nor normal carbonate is present. Add N/50 sulfuric acid from a burette\r\nuntil the chloroform becomes colorless. A white surface behind the\r\nbottle facilitates detection of a trace of color as the end-point is\r\napproached. The calculation is the same as with phenolphthalein\r\nalkalinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BICARBONATE.\r\n\r\nBicarbonate is present if the alkalinity to phenolphthalein is less than\r\none-half the alkalinity to methyl orange, erythrosine, or lacmoid. The\r\nalkalinity to methyl orange, erythrosine, or lacmoid is due entirely to\r\nbicarbonate if there is no phenolphthalein alkalinity. If there is\r\nphenolphthalein alkalinity the bicarbonate, in terms of calcium\r\ncarbonate, is equal to the methyl orange, erythrosine, or lacmoid\r\nalkalinity minus twice the phenolphthalein alkalinity. Bicarbonate,\r\ncarbon dioxide as bicarbonate, and half-bound carbon dioxide can be\r\ncalculated as follows:\r\n\r\nBicarbonate (HCO_{3}) = 1.22 times the bicarbonate expressed in terms of\r\ncalcium carbonate.\r\n\r\nCarbon dioxide (CO_{2}) as bicarbonate = 0.88 times the bicarbonate\r\nexpressed in terms of calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\nHalf-bound carbon dioxide (CO_{2}) = 0.44 times the bicarbonate\r\nexpressed in terms of calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NORMAL CARBONATE.[20][94]\r\n\r\nNormal carbonate is present if the alkalinity to phenolphthalein is\r\ngreater than zero but less than the alkalinity to methyl orange,\r\nerythrosine, or lacmoid. If the phenolphthalein alkalinity is exactly\r\nequal to one-half the methyl orange, erythrosine, or lacmoid alkalinity\r\nthe alkalinity is due entirely to normal carbonate. If the\r\nphenolphthalein alkalinity is less than one-half the methyl orange,\r\nerythrosine, or lacmoid alkalinity normal carbonate expressed in terms\r\nof calcium carbonate is equal to twice the phenolphthalein alkalinity.\r\nIf the phenolphthalein alkalinity is greater than one-half the methyl\r\norange, erythrosine, or lacmoid alkalinity the normal carbonate is equal\r\nto twice the difference between the methyl orange, erythrosine, or\r\nlacmoid alkalinity and the phenolphthalein alkalinity. The carbonate,\r\ncarbon dioxide as carbonate, and bound carbon dioxide can be calculated\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nCarbonate (CO_{3}) = 0.6 times the normal carbonate expressed in terms\r\nof calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\nCarbon dioxide as carbonate (CO_{2}) = 0.44 times the normal carbonate\r\nexpressed in terms of calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\nBound carbon dioxide (CO_{2}) is the sum of the carbon dioxide as\r\ncarbonate and one-half that as bicarbonate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           HYDROXIDE.[20][94]\r\n\r\nIf hydroxide, or caustic alkalinity, is present the alkalinity to\r\nphenolphthalein is greater than one-half the alkalinity to methyl\r\norange, erythrosine, or lacmoid; the alkalinity is due entirely to\r\nhydroxide if the phenolphthalein alkalinity is equal to the methyl\r\norange, erythrosine, or lacmoid alkalinity. If the phenolphthalein\r\nalkalinity is more than half and less than all the methyl orange,\r\nerythrosine, or lacmoid alkalinity, hydroxide, expressed in terms of\r\ncalcium carbonate, is equal to twice the phenolphthalein alkalinity\r\nminus the methyl orange, erythrosine, or lacmoid alkalinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ALKALI CARBONATES.\r\n\r\nWaters which contain sodium or potassium carbonates or bicarbonates\r\ncontain all of their calcium and magnesium as carbonates or\r\nbicarbonates. That is, they possess no non-carbonate hardness (sulfates,\r\nnitrates or chlorides of calcium and magnesium).\r\n\r\nThe most accurate method is to determine the total alkalinity by\r\ntitration with N/50 sulfuric acid, using methyl orange, erythrosine, or\r\nlacmoid as an indicator; then determine the calcium and magnesium\r\ncontent; and subtract from the total alkalinity the computed alkalinity\r\ndue to the calcium and magnesium expressed in terms of calcium\r\ncarbonate. The remainder is the alkalinity due to carbonates and\r\nbicarbonates of sodium and potassium.\r\n\r\nThis determination may also be made by applying the method, for\r\nnon-carbonate hardness with soda reagent (see p. 35), and by noting the\r\nexcess of acid required to neutralize the alkaline carbonates originally\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nWith present information as to solubilities of the normal carbonates of\r\ncalcium and magnesium, it is difficult in their presence to measure\r\nslight quantities of carbonates of sodium or potassium.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ACIDITY.[24d][37]\r\n\r\nWaters may have an acid reaction because of the presence of free carbon\r\ndioxide, mineral acids, or some of their salts, especially those of iron\r\nand aluminium.\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—1. N/50 sodium carbonate. Dissolve 1.06 grams of anhydrous\r\nsodium carbonate in 1 liter of boiled distilled water that has been\r\ncooled in an atmosphere free from carbon dioxide. Preserve this solution\r\nin bottles of resistant glass protected from the air by tubes filled\r\nwith soda-lime. One cc. is equivalent to 1 mg. of CaCO_{3}.\r\n\r\n2. N/22 sodium carbonate. Dissolve 2.41 grams of anhydrous sodium\r\ncarbonate in 1 liter of boiled distilled water that has been cooled in\r\nan atmosphere free from carbon dioxide. Preserve this solution in\r\nbottles of resistant glass protected from the air by tubes filled with\r\nsoda-lime. One cc. is equivalent to 1 mg. of CO_{2}.\r\n\r\n3. Phenolphthalein indicator (see p. 36).\r\n\r\n4. Methyl orange indicator (see p. 36).\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TOTAL ACIDITY.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Add 4 drops of phenolphthalein indicator to 50 or 100 cc.\r\nof the sample in a white porcelain casserole or an Erlenmeyer flask over\r\na white surface. Add N/50 sodium carbonate until the solution turns\r\npink. The total acidity in parts per million of calcium carbonate is\r\nequal to the number of cubic centimeters of N/50 sodium carbonate used\r\nmultiplied by 20 if 50 cc. of the sample was used, or by 10 if 100 cc.\r\nwas used.\r\n\r\n\r\n           FREE CARBON DIOXIDE.[20][23][61][87][88][94a][118]\r\n\r\nCarbon dioxide may exist in water in three forms—free carbon dioxide,\r\nbicarbonate (pp. 37–38), and carbonate (p. 38). One-half the carbon\r\ndioxide as bicarbonate is known as the half-bound carbon dioxide. The\r\ncarbon dioxide as carbonate plus one-half that as bicarbonate is known\r\nas the bound carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Pour 100 cc. of the sample into a tall narrow vessel,\r\npreferably a 100 cc. Nessler tube. Add 10 drops of phenolphthalein\r\nindicator, and titrate rapidly with N/22 sodium carbonate, stirring\r\ngently, until a faint but permanent pink color is produced. The free\r\ncarbon dioxide (CO_{2}) in parts per million is equal to 10 times the\r\nnumber of cubic centimeters of N/22 sodium carbonate used.\r\n\r\nBecause of the ease with which free carbon dioxide escapes from water,\r\nparticularly when the gas is present in large amount, a special sample\r\nshould be collected for this determination, which should preferably be\r\nmade at the time of collection. If the analysis cannot be made at the\r\ntime of collection approximate results with water not too high in free\r\ncarbon dioxide may be obtained on samples collected in bottles\r\ncompletely filled so as to leave no air space under the stopper. Bottled\r\nsamples should be kept, until tested, at a temperature lower than that\r\nof the water when collected. If mineral acids or certain salts are\r\npresent correction must be made. At best, the results of the titration\r\nare uncertain because the proper end-point for correct results differs\r\nin color with different types of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FREE MINERAL ACIDS.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Add 2 drops of methyl orange indicator to 50 or 100 cc. of\r\nthe sample in a white porcelain casserole or an Erlenmeyer flask over a\r\nwhite surface. Add N/50 sodium carbonate from a burette until the pink\r\ncoloration of the solution disappears. The acidity due to free mineral\r\nacids, expressed in terms of calcium carbonate, is equal to the number\r\nof cubic centimeters of N/50 sodium carbonate used multiplied by 20 if\r\n50 cc. of the sample was used, or by 10 if 100 cc. was used.\r\n\r\n\r\n       MINERAL ACIDS AND SULFATES OF IRON AND ALUMINIUM.[24d][37]\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Modify the method for free mineral acids by titrating the\r\nwater at boiling temperature in the presence of phenolphthalein\r\nindicator. The acidity due to free mineral acids and sulfates of iron\r\nand aluminium, expressed in terms of calcium carbonate, is equal to the\r\nnumber of cubic centimeters of N/50 sodium carbonate used multiplied by\r\n20 if 50 cc. of the sample was used, or by 10 if 100 cc. was used.\r\n\r\nThe acidity due to sulfates of iron and aluminium is equal to the\r\nacidity due to mineral acids and sulfates minus the acidity due to\r\nmineral acids. The acidity due to ferrous and ferric sulfate can be\r\ncalculated from the determined amount of these salts (pp. 43–48). The\r\nacidity due to aluminium sulfate is equal to the acidity due to total\r\nacid sulfates minus that due to iron sulfates.\r\n\r\nAcidity shall be reported in parts per million of calcium carbonate\r\n(CaCO_{3}). Sulfate (SO_{4}) equals parts per million of calcium\r\ncarbonate multiplied by 0.96.\r\n\r\nCarbon dioxide (CO_{2}) equals parts per million of calcium carbonate\r\nmultiplied by 0.44.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHLORIDE.[16]\r\n\r\nChloride in water and sewage has its origin in common salt, from mineral\r\ndeposits in the earth, from ocean vapors carried inland by the wind, or\r\nfrom polluting materials like sewage and trade wastes, which contain the\r\nsalt used in the household and in manufacturing. Comparison of the\r\nchloride content of a water with that of other waters in the vicinity\r\nknown to be unpolluted frequently affords useful information as to its\r\nsanitary quality. If, however, the chloride normally exceeds 20 parts\r\nper million because of chloride-bearing mineral deposits the chloride\r\ncontent of a water has little sanitary significance.\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—1. Standard sodium chloride solution. Dissolve 16.48 grams\r\nof pure fused sodium chloride in 1 liter of distilled water. Dilute 100\r\ncc. of this stock solution to 1 liter in order to obtain a standard\r\nsolution each cubic centimeter of which contains 0.001 gram of chloride.\r\n\r\n2. Standard silver nitrate solution. Dissolve about 2.40 grams of silver\r\nnitrate crystals in 1 liter of distilled water. Standardize this with\r\nthe standard salt solution, and adjust, correcting for volume (see p.\r\n43), so that 1 cc. will be exactly equivalent to 0.0005 gram of\r\nchloride.\r\n\r\n3. Potassium chromate indicator. Dissolve 50 grams of neutral potassium\r\nchromate in a little distilled water. Add enough silver nitrate to\r\nproduce a slight red precipitate. Filter and dilute the filtrate to 1\r\nliter with distilled water.\r\n\r\n4. Aluminium hydroxide. Electrolyze ammonia-free water, using aluminium\r\nelectrodes. Wash the precipitate until it is free from chloride,\r\nammonia, and nitrite. Or dissolve 125 grams of potassium or ammonium\r\nalum in 1 liter of distilled water. Precipitate the aluminium by adding\r\ncautiously ammonium hydroxide. Wash the precipitate in a large jar by\r\nsuccessive additions and decantations of distilled water until free from\r\nchloride, nitrite, and ammonia.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Add 1 cc. of potassium chromate indicator to 50 cc. of the\r\nsample in a 6–inch white porcelain evaporating dish or a 150 cc.\r\nErlenmeyer flask over a white surface. Titrate with the silver nitrate\r\nsolution under similar conditions of volume, light, and temperature as\r\nwere used in standardizing the silver nitrate until a faint reddish\r\ncoloration is perceptible. The detection of the end-point is facilitated\r\nby comparison of the contents of the porcelain dish with those of\r\nanother dish containing the same quantity of potassium chromate\r\nindicator in 50 cc. of distilled water. Some analysts prefer to make the\r\ntitration in a dark-room provided with a yellow light. The end-point is\r\nvery sharp by electric light and also by daylight with photographic\r\nyellow glass. The titration may be made in Nessler tubes[68a] if the\r\nsolutions are standardized under similar conditions.\r\n\r\nIf the amount of chloride is very high use 25 cc., or even a smaller\r\nquantity, dilute the volume taken to 50 cc. with distilled water. If the\r\namount of chloride is very low concentrate 250 cc. of the sample to 50\r\ncc. by evaporation. Rotate the liquid to make sure that no residue\r\nremains undissolved on the walls of the dish, and, if necessary, use a\r\nrubber-tipped glass rod to assist in this operation.\r\n\r\nChloride is determined by some observers by extracting with hot\r\ndistilled water the residue in the platinum dish in the determination of\r\nthe residue on evaporation and proceeding as just described. This is\r\npermissible if a little sodium carbonate is added before evaporation to\r\nprevent loss of chloride through decomposition of magnesium chloride in\r\nthe residue.\r\n\r\nIf the sample has a color greater than 30 it should be decolorized by\r\nshaking it thoroughly with washed aluminium hydroxide (3 cc. to 500 cc.\r\nof the sample) and allowing the precipitate to settle. Make the\r\ndetermination on a portion of the clarified sample, filtered if\r\nnecessary. If the sample is acid, neutralize it with sodium carbonate;\r\nif hydroxide is present, add dilute sulfuric acid until the cold liquid\r\nwill just discharge the color of phenolphthalein. If the presence of\r\nsulfide and sulfocyanate renders it necessary, make proper\r\ncorrections[24c][100b] or modifications in treatment.\r\n\r\nMake correction for the error due to variations in the volume of the\r\nliquid and precipitate by means of the formula[39] X = 0.003V + 0.02, in\r\nwhich X = the correction in cubic centimeters of silver nitrate solution\r\nand V = cubic centimeters of liquid at the end of the titration. If 50\r\ncc. of the sample is titrated chloride (Cl) in parts per million is\r\nequal to the number of cubic centimeters of silver nitrate solution\r\nmultiplied by 10. The correction to be applied is 0.2 cc. unless unusual\r\naccuracy is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             IRON.[94b][98]\r\n\r\nIron occurs in natural waters in both ferrous and ferric condition,\r\ndepending on the source of the sample. In ground waters the iron is\r\nusually in an unoxidized and soluble condition, sometimes combined with\r\ncarbonic or sulfuric acid, and also in combination with organic matter.\r\nMany waters, especially those that have been exposed to the air, contain\r\nthe iron in the form of a colloidal hydroxide. Silt-bearing waters often\r\ncontain much iron in suspension, usually in an oxidized form. Sewages\r\nand sewage effluents, particularly those receiving manufacturing wastes,\r\ncontain various forms of iron of different degrees of solubility,\r\noxidation, and coagulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TOTAL IRON.[59][63b]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          COLORIMETRIC METHOD.\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—1. Standard iron solution. Dissolve 0.7 gram of crystallized\r\nferrous ammonium sulfate in 50 cc. of distilled water to which 20 cc. of\r\ndilute sulfuric acid has been added. Warm the solution slightly and add\r\npotassium permanganate until the iron is completely oxidized. Dilute the\r\nsolution to 1 liter. One cc. of the standard solution equals 0.1 mg. Fe.\r\n\r\n2. Potassium sulfocyanide solution. Dissolve 20 grams of the salt in 1\r\nliter of distilled water.\r\n\r\n3. Dilute hydrochloric acid. One volume of acid (Sp. gr. 1.2) and one\r\nvolume of distilled water. This shall be free from nitric acid.\r\n\r\n4. N/5 potassium permanganate. Dissolve 6.30 grams of the salt in\r\ndistilled water and dilute to 1 liter.\r\n\r\n5. Hydrochloric acid. Concentrated, free from iron.\r\n\r\n6. Nitric acid. Concentrated, free from iron.\r\n\r\n7. Nitric acid. 5N, free from iron.\r\n\r\n_First procedure._—Evaporate 100 cc. of the water to dryness, or use the\r\nresidue left after the determination of residue on evaporation (p. 29).\r\nIgnite the residue at a low red heat taking care not to heat it hot\r\nenough to make the iron difficultly soluble. Cool the dish and add 5 cc.\r\nof concentrated hydrochloric acid. Moisten the inner surface of the\r\ndish. Warm the solution for two or three minutes, and again moisten the\r\ninner surface of the dish by permitting the hot acid to flow over it.\r\nWash the hot solution from the dish into a 50 cc. Nessler tube,\r\nfiltering if necessary through paper that has been washed with hot\r\nwater. Dilute to 50 cc., and add 3 drops of potassium permanganate\r\nsolution. Add 5 cc. of potassium sulfocyanide solution, mix, and compare\r\nwith standards.\r\n\r\nIf it is not convenient to use the residue on evaporation and if the\r\nsample is relatively free from organic matter, boil 50 cc. of the sample\r\nwith 5 cc. of 5N nitric acid for five minutes. Add a few drops of\r\npermanganate and 5 cc. of potassium sulfocyanide and compare with\r\nstandards, using nitric acid in place of hydrochloric acid in the\r\nstandards. This method is excellent for ground waters. The permanganate\r\nand acid liberate chlorine in water high in chloride, and produce a\r\npermanent yellow color which interferes with the determination, unless\r\nthe sample is first diluted to 50 cc. An excess of permanganate,\r\nreacting with hydrochloric acid, causes similar trouble. The amounts of\r\nhydrochloric acid, 5 cc., and of sulfocyanide, 5 cc., should be\r\napproximately measured because more acid lightens the color whereas more\r\nsulfocyanide deepens it. This is especially important if permanent\r\nstandards are used.\r\n\r\n_Second procedure._—For surface waters containing small amounts of\r\norganic matter, the method of Klut[59] is recommended. Samples\r\ncontaining small amounts of iron should be concentrated, if possible,\r\nuntil at least 0.5 mg. of iron is present in the volume tested. Boil the\r\nsample in a beaker with 2 to 3 cc. of concentrated nitric acid free from\r\niron, adding permanganate if necessary to destroy the organic matter. To\r\nthe hot liquid add ammonia in slight excess and warm until the smell of\r\nammonia is hardly discernible. Filter and wash with water at 70° to 80°\r\nC. containing a little ammonia. Dissolve the iron in the beaker and on\r\nthe filter paper in 5 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and wash\r\nwith hot water until the iron is all dissolved, collecting the filtrate\r\nin a 50 cc. Nessler tube. Dilute to 50 cc. Add potassium sulfocyanide\r\nand determine the iron by comparison with standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    COMPARISON WITH IRON STANDARDS.\r\n\r\n_First procedure._—Prepare standards containing amounts of standard iron\r\nsolution ranging from 0.05 to 4 cc. according to the quantity of iron in\r\nthe sample. Dilute these amounts with water to about 40 cc. Add 5 cc. of\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid and 3 drops of potassium permanganate to each\r\ntube and dilute to 50 cc. Add 5 cc. of the potassium sulfocyanide to\r\neach of the standard solutions at the same time that it is added to the\r\nsamples of water under examination, and compare immediately after\r\nmixing. If 100 cc. of the sample is used the iron in parts per million\r\nis equal to the number of cubic centimeters of the standard iron\r\nsolution in the standard that the sample matches.\r\n\r\n_Second procedure._—For a small number of determinations it is more\r\nconvenient to run the standard iron solution into a Nessler tube\r\ncontaining the acid, distilled water, and potassium sulfocyanide until\r\nthe color matches that of the sample tested. When determining iron in\r\nthree or four samples the colors may be matched in the order of their\r\nintensity and the volumes of standard iron solution required for each\r\ntube may be read from the burette.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  COMPARISON WITH PERMANENT STANDARDS.\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—1. Platinum solution. Dissolve 2 grams of potassium platinic\r\nchloride (PtCl_{4}.2KCl) in distilled water, add 100 cc. of concentrated\r\nhydrochloric acid, and dilute to 1 liter with distilled water.\r\n\r\n2. Cobalt solution. Dissolve 24 grams of dry cobaltous chloride crystals\r\n(CoCl_{2}.6H_{2}O) in a small amount of distilled water, add 100 cc. of\r\nstrong hydrochloric acid, and dilute to 1 liter with distilled water.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Prepare a series of permanent standards by diluting to 50\r\ncc. with distilled water the amounts of platinum and cobalt solutions,\r\nin 50 cc. Nessler tubes, indicated in Table 9. Compare the sample with\r\nthese standards, and calculate the parts per million of iron.\r\n\r\n  Table 9.—PREPARATION OF PERMANENT STANDARDS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF\r\n                                  IRON.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────┬───────────────────────┬───────────────────────\r\n Value in standard iron │  Platinum solution.   │   Cobalt solution.\r\n        solution.       │                       │\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────────────────\r\n          _cc._         │         _cc._         │         _cc._\r\n                     0.0│                      0│                    0.0\r\n                      .1│                      2│                    1.0\r\n                      .3│                      6│                    3.0\r\n                      .5│                     10│                    5.0\r\n                      .7│                     14│                    7.5\r\n                     1.0│                     20│                   11.0\r\n                     1.5│                     28│                   17.0\r\n                     2.0│                     35│                   24.0\r\n                     2.5│                     39│                   32.0\r\n                     3.0│                     39│                   43.0\r\n                     3.5│                     40│                   55.0\r\n ───────────────────────┴───────────────────────┴───────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n                        VOLUMETRIC METHOD.[24f]\r\n\r\nSome samples of sewage and water mixed with trade wastes and mine\r\ndrainage contain so much iron that it is preferable to use the\r\nvolumetric method described on page 57 for the determination of both\r\ntotal and dissolved iron, rather than to work with quantities small\r\nenough to permit application of the colorimetric methods just described.\r\nIf iron is present in large quantities in suspension, as in some sewages\r\nand septic tank effluents, it may be filtered off and the residue\r\nwashed, ignited, and fused with potassium and sodium carbonate. The\r\nfusion is then extracted with hydrochloric acid and the iron determined\r\nas on page 57.\r\n\r\nSamples containing much organic matter should be evaporated to dryness\r\nwith 0.5 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid and the residue then ignited\r\nbefore estimation of iron.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            DISSOLVED IRON.\r\n\r\nDetermine, by the method described for total iron, the iron in the\r\nsample after filtration.

Standard iron solution. Dissolve 0.7 gram of crystallized\r\nferrous ammonium sulfate in a large volume of freshly boiled distilled\r\nwater to which 10 cc. of dilute sulfuric acid has been added and dilute\r\nto 1 liter. This solution should be freshly prepared when needed. One\r\ncc. of this standard solution contains 0.1 mg. of Fe.\r\n\r\n2. Potassium ferricyanide solution. Dissolve 5 grams of the salt in 1\r\nliter of distilled water. Use a freshly prepared solution.\r\n\r\n3. Dilute sulfuric acid. Dilute 1 part of sulfuric acid, specific\r\ngravity 1.84, with 5 parts of distilled water.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Add 10 cc. of dilute sulfuric acid to 50 cc. of the sample,\r\nremove the suspended matter by filtration if necessary, and add 15 cc.\r\nof potassium ferricyanide solution. Dilute the solution to 100 cc. with\r\ndistilled water. Compare the color developed in the sample with that in\r\nstandards made at the same time from the ferrous iron solution. Place in\r\n100 cc. Nessler tubes, in the following order, 75 cc. of distilled\r\nwater, 10 cc. of dilute sulfuric acid, and 15 cc. of potassium\r\nferricyanide solution, and mix well the contents of each tube. Prepare\r\nas many tubes in this way as are needed. Add various quantities of\r\nstandard ferrous iron solution to several tubes, mix well, and compare\r\nthe resulting colors with the samples _immediately_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FERRIC IRON.\r\n\r\nThe amount of ferric iron in solution and suspension is equal to the\r\ndifference between the total iron and the ferrous iron obtained by the\r\nmethods described.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MANGANESE.\r\n\r\nIf the sample contains less than 10 parts per million of manganese, use\r\na colorimetric method in which the manganous salt is oxidized to\r\npermanganate and the color produced thereby is compared with that of a\r\nstandard solution similarly treated. The persulfate method and the\r\nbismuthate method are suitable. If the sample contains more than 10\r\nparts per million of manganese it is sometimes preferable to use a\r\nvolumetric or gravimetric method.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PERSULFATE METHOD.\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—1. Nitric acid. Dilute concentrated nitric acid with an\r\nequal volume of distilled water. Free the diluted acid from brown oxides\r\nof nitrogen by aeration.\r\n\r\n2. Silver nitrate. Dissolve 20 grams of silver nitrate in 1 liter of\r\ndistilled water.\r\n\r\n3. Standard manganous sulfate. Dissolve 0.288 gram of purest potassium\r\npermanganate in about 100 cc. of distilled water. Acidify the solution\r\nwith sulfuric acid and heat to boiling. Add slowly a sufficient quantity\r\nof dilute solution of oxalic acid to discharge the color. Cool and\r\ndilute to 1 liter. One cc. of this solution contains 0.1 mg. of\r\nmanganese.\r\n\r\n4. Ammonium persulfate. Crystals, free from chloride.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Use an amount of the sample that contains not more than 0.2\r\nmg. of manganese. Add 2 cc. of nitric acid and boil down to about 50 cc.\r\nPrecipitate the chloride with silver nitrate solution, adding at least 1\r\ncc. in excess. Shake and heat to coagulate the precipitate, and filter.\r\nA sample that contains much chloride should be evaporated with a few\r\ndrops of sulfuric acid until white fumes appear and then diluted before\r\nthe nitric acid and silver nitrate are added as directed above. If the\r\nsample is highly colored by organic matter it should be evaporated with\r\nsulfuric acid, and the residue ignited and dissolved in dilute nitric\r\nacid. Add about 0.5 gram of ammonium persulfate crystals and warm the\r\nsolution until the maximum permanganate color is developed. This usually\r\ntakes about ten minutes. At the same time prepare standards by diluting\r\nportions of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 cc., etc. of the standard manganous sulfate\r\nsolution to about 50 cc. and treating them exactly as the sample was\r\ntreated. Transfer the sample and the standards to 50 cc. Nessler tubes,\r\nand compare the colors immediately. Manganese in parts per million is\r\nequal to the number of cubic centimeters of standard manganous sulfate\r\nsolution in the tube that the sample matches multiplied by 100, divided\r\nby the number of cubic centimeters of the sample used.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BISMUTHATE METHOD.[2a][113]\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—1. Nitric acid. Dilute 1 part of concentrated nitric acid\r\nwith 4 parts of distilled water. Free the dilute acid from brown oxides\r\nof nitrogen by aeration.\r\n\r\n2. Sulfuric acid. Dilute 1 part of concentrated sulfuric acid with 3\r\nparts of distilled water.\r\n\r\n3. Dilute sulfuric acid. Dilute 25 cc. of concentrated acid to 1 liter\r\nwith distilled water. Add enough permanganate solution to color faintly\r\nthe dilute acid.\r\n\r\n4. Standard manganous sulfate. The standard solution of manganous\r\nsulfate prepared as described under persulfate method (p. 48) should be\r\nused and the standards should be prepared by following the same\r\nprocedure as is used for the sample. This solution is more permanent\r\nthan a solution of potassium permanganate, which may, however, be used.\r\nTo prepare it dissolve 0.288 gram of potassium permanganate in distilled\r\nwater and dilute the solution to 1 liter.\r\n\r\n5. Sodium bismuthate. Purest dry salt.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Use an amount of the sample that contains not more than 0.2\r\nmg. of manganese. Add 0.5 cc. of sulfuric acid and evaporate to dryness.\r\nHeat until the sulfuric acid is volatilized and ignite the residue.\r\nDissolve in 40 cc. of nitric acid, add about 0.5 gram of sodium\r\nbismuthate, and heat until the permanganate color disappears. Add a few\r\ndrops of a solution of ammonium or sodium bisulfate to clear the\r\nsolution and again boil to expel oxides of nitrogen. Remove from the\r\nsource of heat, cool to 20° C., again add 0.5 gram of sodium bismuthate,\r\nand stir. When the maximum permanganate color has developed, filter\r\nthrough an alundum or Gooch crucible containing an asbestos mat ignited\r\nand washed with potassium permanganate. Wash the precipitate with dilute\r\nsulfuric acid until the washings are colorless. Transfer the filtrate to\r\na 50 cc. Nessler tube and compare the color of it with that of standards\r\nprepared from the potassium permanganate solution. To prepare the\r\nstandards, dilute portions of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 cc., etc. of the\r\npermanganate solution to 50 cc. with dilute sulfuric acid. The content\r\nof manganese is calculated as described under persulfate method (p. 49).\r\n\r\n\r\n                  LEAD, ZINC, COPPER, AND TIN.[7][60]\r\n\r\nDeterminations of lead, zinc, copper, and tin are important in certain\r\nmining regions and in places where the water has a solvent action on\r\npipes and other containers. The use of certain “germicides” also makes\r\nit necessary to test for some of these metals.\r\n\r\nLead, zinc, and copper may be determined colorimetrically or\r\nelectrolytically. The colorimetric methods are not so accurate as a\r\ncombination of both, and are chiefly of value as qualitative tests.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to make a rough estimation of the amount of lead in clear\r\nwaters by acidifying with acetic acid, saturating with hydrogen sulfide,\r\nand comparing the color produced with that produced by standard lead\r\nsolutions in Nessler tubes, treated in similar manner. This method,\r\nhowever, is not applicable if the water is colored or contains iron.\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—1. Standard lead solution. Dissolve 1.60 grams of lead\r\nnitrate (Pb(NO_{3})_{2}) in 1 liter of distilled water. One cc. of this\r\nsolution contains 1 mg. of lead (Pb). As a check it is desirable to\r\ndetermine lead as sulfate in a measured portion of this solution.\r\n\r\n2. Standard copper solution. Dissolve about 0.8 gram of copper sulfate\r\ncrystals (CuSO_{4}.5H_{2}O) in water and, after the addition of 1 cc. of\r\nconcentrated sulfuric acid, dilute the solution to 1 liter. Determine\r\nthe copper in 100 cc. of this solution in the usual way by electrolytic\r\ndeposition. Dilute the solution so that 1 cc. contains 0.2 milligram\r\ncopper (Cu).

Add\r\n10 or 15 cc. of ammonium chloride solution to assist in the separation\r\nof the sulfides, then add a few drops of concentrated ammonium\r\nhydroxide, and saturate with hydrogen sulfide. Allow to stand some time,\r\npreferably over night, add a little more ammonium hydroxide and hydrogen\r\nsulfide, boil the contents of the dish a few minutes, and filter. The\r\nprecipitate (2) may consist of lead, zinc, copper, and iron sulfides and\r\nthe suspended organic matter. The soluble coloring matter is in the\r\nfiltrate (3). Wash the precipitate a few times with hot water, place the\r\nprecipitate and the filter paper in the original dish and boil with\r\ndilute nitric acid, rubbing down the sides of the dish, if necessary, to\r\ndetach any adhering sulfide precipitate. After again filtering and\r\nwashing several times with hot water, evaporate the filtrate and\r\nwashings in the original dish to a bulk of 10 to 15 cc., cool, add 5 cc.\r\nof concentrated sulfuric acid, and heat until copious fumes of sulfuric\r\nacid are evolved.\r\n\r\nFootnote D:\r\n\r\n  The numbers in parentheses refer to tables 10–12, pages 55–56.\r\n\r\nIf lead is present dilute the contents of the dish slightly with water,\r\nand treat them with 150 cc. of 50 per cent alcohol, in which the lead\r\nsulfate is insoluble. Allow to stand some time, preferably over night,\r\nfilter off the lead sulfate, and wash it with 50 per cent alcohol. Save\r\nthe filtrate for the determination of zinc.\r\n\r\nDissolve the precipitate of lead sulfate by boiling the filter\r\ncontaining it in ammonium acetate solution in a porcelain dish. (4).\r\nFilter into a 50 cc. Nessler tube and wash the filter with boiling water\r\ncontaining a little ammonium acetate. Divide this filtrate in halves and\r\ntreat one-half with saturated hydrogen sulfide water in order to get an\r\napproximation of the amount of lead present. To the other half, or an\r\naliquot portion, if a large amount of lead is present, add a few drops\r\nof acetic acid, then an excess of saturated hydrogen sulfide solution,\r\nand compare the color with that of standards made by treating known\r\namounts of the standard lead solution with a little acetic acid,\r\nammonium acetate, and hydrogen sulfide.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ZINC.\r\n\r\nIf zinc is present and copper is absent concentrate the filtrate from\r\nthe lead sulfate to expel the alcohol, and remove the iron by adding an\r\nexcess of ammonium hydroxide. Filter, wash, and acidify the filtrate\r\nwith sulfuric acid. Concentrate the filtrate to about 150 cc. and\r\ntransfer to a weighed platinum dish. Add 2 grams of potassium oxalate\r\nand 1.5 grams of potassium sulfate. Deposit the zinc electrolytically by\r\nmeans of a current of about 0.3 ampere for three hours. After deposition\r\nis complete and while the current is on, siphon off the solution and at\r\nthe same time run into the dish a stream of distilled water in order to\r\nexpel the free sulfuric acid, which might dissolve some of the zinc if\r\nthe circuit were broken. After the acid has been removed break the\r\ncircuit, wash the dish with water, then with 95 per cent alcohol, dry at\r\n70° C., cool, and weigh it. The difference between this weight (10) and\r\nthe weight of the platinum dish equals the amount of metallic zinc. Some\r\ndifficulty has been experienced in this determination in obtaining pure\r\nreagents. It is therefore advisable to make blank determinations with\r\neach new lot of reagents and to correct the results if necessary.\r\n\r\nIf copper also is present (5) concentrate the filtrate from the lead\r\nsulfate until the alcohol is expelled, and add an excess of ammonium\r\nhydroxide. (6) Remove any iron precipitate by filtration. Neutralize the\r\nfiltrate (7) with sulfuric acid, and add 2 cc. of concentrated sulfuric\r\nacid and 1 gram of urea. Electrolyze the solution and determine copper\r\ncolorimetrically as described in the procedure for copper (p. 54). After\r\nthe copper has been deposited add ammonium hydroxide to the solution\r\ncontaining the zinc until nearly all the sulfuric acid has been\r\nneutralized, concentrate to slightly less than the capacity of the\r\nplatinum dish, add 1.5 grams of potassium sulfate and 2 grams of\r\npotassium oxalate, and electrolyze for zinc. As this solution is usually\r\nsaturated with ammonium salts due to neutralizing the large quantity of\r\nsulfuric acid, it is frequently impossible to get the zinc deposited\r\nfirmly on the dish before the salts interfere by crystallization. To\r\navoid this difficulty, dilute half the solution and electrolyze it for\r\nzinc; or, if the amount of zinc is very small, precipitate the zinc as\r\nsulfide in acetic acid solution, wash, ignite to oxide, and weigh the\r\nprecipitate. This difficulty will not be encountered if copper is absent\r\nas there will then be no excess of ammonium salts.\r\n\r\nIf lead and copper are known to be absent and zinc alone is to be\r\ndetermined (13), after treating with sulfuric acid for separation of\r\nlead, slightly dilute the contents of the dish. Add an excess of\r\nammonium hydroxide to precipitate iron and filter. Make the filtrate\r\nslightly acid with sulfuric acid, concentrate to about 150 cc., transfer\r\nto a weighed platinum dish, add potassium oxalate and sulfate, and\r\nelectrolyze the solution as described for deposition of zinc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COPPER.[77]\r\n\r\nUse 1 liter of a sample containing 0.1 to 1.0 part per million of\r\ncopper, and proportionate amounts for other concentrations. Evaporate to\r\nabout 75 cc., and wash into a 100 cc. platinum dish. Add 2 cc. of dilute\r\nsulfuric acid for clear and soft waters; add more acid to very alkaline\r\nwaters to offset the alkalinity; add 5 cc. of acid to waters carrying\r\nmuch organic matter or clay to insure the formation of a soluble copper\r\nsalt. Then place the dish as the anode in a direct current circuit,\r\nsuspend a spiral wire cathode in the solution so that it is parallel to\r\nand about half an inch from the bottom of the dish, and close the\r\ncircuit.\r\n\r\nElectrolyze for about four hours with occasional stirring, or over\r\nnight, if convenient. The current may be supplied by two gravity cells\r\nin series, yielding a current through the solution of about 0.02 ampere.\r\nLift out the cathode without previously opening the circuit, and immerse\r\nthe spiral in a small amount of dilute nitric acid previously heated to\r\nboiling. Wash off the wire and evaporate the nitric acid solution to\r\ndryness on the water bath. If the presence of silver is suspected add a\r\nfew drops of hydrochloric acid before evaporation. Dissolve the residue\r\nin water and wash it into a 50 cc. Nessler tube. Dilute to 50 cc. and\r\nadd 10 cc. of the potassium sulfide solution. The color of the copper\r\nsulfide develops at once and is fairly permanent, lasting at least\r\nseveral hours. Add 10 cc. of the potassium sulfide solution to a similar\r\ntube containing 50 cc. of distilled water, and then add to it standard\r\ncopper solution in 0.2 cc. portions until the colors of the two tubes\r\nmatch. If 1 liter of the sample is used copper in parts per million is\r\nequal to the number of cubic centimeters of standard copper solution\r\nrequired to match the color of the sample multiplied by 0.2.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  TIN.\r\n\r\nSmall quantities of tin are occasionally found in waters that have\r\npassed through tin or tin-lined pipes. This metal, if present, is\r\nprecipitated with the iron by ammonia in the lead, zinc, and copper\r\nseparations. In the method for copper alone, it is removed in the same\r\nway and may be further avoided by dissolving the sulfides in\r\nconcentrated nitric acid. Any tin present will then separate as an\r\ninsoluble compound, which may be ignited and weighed as the oxide\r\n(SnO_{2}).\r\n\r\nThe following schematic tables illustrate the procedures given.\r\n\r\n     Table 10.—SCHEME FOR THE SEPARATION OF LEAD, ZINC, AND COPPER.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n 1.

When the residue is nearly dry\r\nadd 1 cc. of hydrochloric acid (1 to 1) and, after moistening the sides\r\nof the dish, evaporate to dryness. Dry at 180° C. and if much organic\r\nmatter is present char it in a radiator. Moisten the residue with dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid and expel the excess of acid by heating on the water\r\nbath. Add a few drops of hydrochloric acid, dissolve in hot water, and\r\nfilter. Wash the residue with hot water. Evaporate the filtrate to\r\ndryness, repeat the filtration, and combine the two residues. If great\r\naccuracy is not required the second evaporation with hydrochloric acid\r\nmay be omitted. Ignite and weigh the insoluble residue. Add 2 drops of\r\nconcentrated sulfuric acid and a little hydrofluoric acid, volatilize\r\nthe acids, ignite, and weigh again. Report the loss in weight as silica\r\n(SiO_{2}). A weight of non-volatile matter exceeding 0.5 mg. should be\r\nanalyzed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          IRON AND ALUMINIUM.\r\n\r\nHeat to boiling the filtrate from the insoluble residue, oxidize with\r\nconcentrated nitric acid or bromine, and concentrate to about 25 cc. Add\r\nammonium hydroxide in slight excess, boil one minute, and filter.\r\nDissolve the precipitate on the filter in a small amount of hot dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid. Reprecipitate with ammonium hydroxide, filter, and\r\nwash. Unless very accurate results are necessary this solution and\r\nreprecipitation may be omitted. Unite the two filtrates for\r\ndetermination of calcium. Ignite and weigh the precipitate. It will\r\ncomprise oxides of iron and aluminium and phosphate. If much phosphate\r\nis present it should be determined in a separate sample and a correction\r\nfor the amount applied; otherwise it may be neglected. Determine the\r\niron in the ignited precipitate by fusion with sodium or potassium\r\npyrosulfate, reduction with zinc, and titration with potassium\r\npermanganate. Aluminium (Al) is calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n            Al = 0.53[(Fe_{2}O_{3} + Al_{2}O_{3}) − 1.43 Fe]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CALCIUM.\r\n\r\nConcentrate the filtrate from the separation of iron and aluminium to\r\nabout 100 cc., and add an excess of concentrated solution of ammonium\r\noxalate, little by little, to the hot ammoniacal solution. Keep the\r\nsolution warm and stir at intervals till the precipitate settles readily\r\nand leaves a clear supernatant liquid. Filter, dissolve the precipitate\r\nin a little hot dilute hydrochloric acid, and reprecipitate with\r\nammonium hydroxide and ammonium oxalate. If great accuracy is not\r\nrequired this solution and reprecipitation may be omitted, and the first\r\nprecipitate may be washed clean with hot water[64a]. Save the filtrate\r\nfor determination of magnesium. Ignite the precipitate and weigh it as\r\ncalcium oxide, 71.5 per cent of which is the equivalent of calcium (Ca);\r\nor dissolve the precipitate in hot 2 per cent sulfuric acid and titrate\r\nwith a standard solution of potassium permanganate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MAGNESIUM.\r\n\r\nAcidify with hydrochloric acid the filtrate from the separation of\r\ncalcium and concentrate it to about 100 cc. Add 20 cc. of a saturated\r\nsolution of microcosmic salt, cool, and make slightly but distinctly\r\nalkaline by adding ammonium hydroxide, drop by drop. Allow the solution\r\nto stand four hours, then filter and wash with 3 per cent ammonium\r\nhydroxide. Dissolve the precipitate, especially in the presence of large\r\namounts of sodium or potassium, in a slight excess of dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid and reprecipitate the magnesium with ammonium\r\nhydroxide and a few drops of microcosmic salt solution. If great\r\naccuracy is not required this solution and reprecipitation may be\r\nomitted. Ignite the precipitate and weigh it as magnesium pyrophosphate\r\n(Mg_{2}P_{2}O_{7}), 21.9 per cent of which is the equivalent of\r\nmagnesium (Mg.). If manganese is present[64a] it is precipitated with\r\nthe magnesium and a correction for it should be applied after having\r\ndetermined manganese in a separate sample. The weight of manganese\r\npyrophosphate (Mn_{2}P_{2}O_{7}) is 2.58 times the weight of manganese.\r\n\r\n\r\n             SEPARATION OF SULFATE, SODIUM, AND POTASSIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SULFATE.\r\n\r\nEvaporate to dryness 100 to 1,000 cc. of the sample, or sufficient to\r\nobtain a residue weighing 0.4 to 0.6 gram and containing preferably 0.05\r\nto 0.2 gram of sodium. Acidify the residue with hydrochloric acid and\r\nremove the silica, iron, and aluminium (pp. 56–57). Make acid and add a\r\nhot solution of barium chloride in slight excess to the hot filtrate,\r\nand warm it, stirring at intervals for one-half hour, until the\r\nprecipitate settles readily and leaves a clear supernatant liquid. Dry,\r\nignite, and weigh the precipitate of barium sulfate, 41.1 per cent of\r\nwhich is equal to the content of sulfate (SO_{4}).\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SODIUM, POTASSIUM, AND LITHIUM.\r\n\r\nEvaporate to dryness the filtrate from the precipitation of barium\r\nsulfate. Add a few cubic centimeters of hot water and then a saturated\r\nsolution of barium hydroxide until a slight film collects on the top of\r\nthe solution. Filter and wash the precipitate with hot water. Add to the\r\nfiltrate an excess of ammonium hydroxide and ammonium carbonate\r\nsolution. Filter, evaporate the filtrate to dryness, dry, and ignite at\r\nlow red heat to expel ammonium salts. Repeat the operations including\r\nthe addition of barium hydroxide until no precipitate is obtained by\r\nbarium hydroxide or by ammonium hydroxide and ammonium carbonate.\r\nEvaporate the final filtrate to dryness in a weighed platinum dish, dry,\r\ncool, and weigh the residue. Dissolve the residue in a few cubic\r\ncentimeters of water, filter, wash the filter paper twice with hot\r\nwater, then ignite the filter paper in the platinum dish. Cool and weigh\r\nthe residue. Subtract this weight from the first weight including the\r\nresidue. The difference is the weight of the chlorides of sodium and\r\npotassium and lithium. If it is not desired to separate sodium and\r\npotassium the weight of sodium and potassium as sodium may be calculated\r\nfrom this difference by multiplying it by 0.394.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               POTASSIUM.\r\n\r\n_First procedure._—Add to the solution of the chlorides of sodium and\r\npotassium a few drops of dilute hydrochloric acid (1 to 3) and 1 cc. of\r\n10 per cent platinic chloride (PtCl_{4}) for each 30 mg. of the combined\r\nchlorides. Evaporate to a thick syrup on the water bath, then remove\r\ndish and allow it to come to dryness at laboratory temperature. Treat\r\nthe residue cold with 80 per cent alcohol and filter. Wash the\r\nprecipitate with 80 per cent alcohol until the filtrate is no longer\r\ncolored. Dry the precipitate and dissolve it in hot water. Evaporate the\r\nsolution to dryness in a platinum dish and weigh it as potassium\r\nplatinic chloride (K_{2}PtCl_{6}). The weight of potassium (K) is 16.1\r\nper cent of this weight and the equivalent of potassium chloride (KCl)\r\nis 30.7 per cent of this weight. Subtract the equivalent weight of\r\npotassium chloride from the weight of the combined chlorides. The weight\r\nof the sodium is 39.4 per cent of the difference.\r\n\r\n_Second procedure._[86][103a]—Add to the hot solution of the combined\r\nchlorides 20 per cent perchloric acid (HClO_{4}) slightly in excess of\r\nthe amount required to combine with the bases. One cubic centimeter of\r\n20 per cent perchloric acid is equivalent to 90 mg. of potassium.\r\nEvaporate the solution to dryness, dissolve the residue in 10 cc. of hot\r\nwater and a small amount of perchloric acid, and again evaporate to\r\ndryness. Repeat the addition of water, perchloric acid, and evaporation\r\nuntil white fumes appear on evaporating to dryness. Add to the residue\r\n25 cc. of 96 per cent alcohol containing 0.2 per cent of perchloric acid\r\n(1 cc. of 20 per cent perchloric acid in 100 cc. of 98 per cent\r\nalcohol). Break up the residue with a stirring rod. Decant the\r\nsupernatant liquid through a weighed Gooch crucible that has been washed\r\nwith 0.2 per cent perchloric acid in alcohol. If the precipitate is\r\nunusually large dissolve it in hot water and repeat the evaporation with\r\nperchloric acid. Wash the precipitate once by decantation with the 0.2\r\nper cent perchloric acid in alcohol, transfer the precipitate to the\r\ncrucible, and wash it several times with a 0.2 per cent perchloric acid\r\nin alcohol. Dry the crucible at 120–130° C. for one hour, cool, and\r\nweigh it. The increase in weight is potassium perchlorate (KClO_{4}).\r\nThe equivalent weight of potassium is 28.2 per cent and the equivalent\r\nweight of potassium chloride is 53.8 per cent of the potassium\r\nperchlorate. Calculate the content of sodium by difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LITHIUM.[34]\r\n\r\nUse a large quantity of the sample. Obtain the combined chlorides of\r\nsodium, potassium, and lithium (see pp. 58–59). Transfer the combined\r\nchlorides to a small Erlenmeyer flask (50 or 100 cc. capacity) and\r\nevaporate the solution nearly, but not quite, to dryness. Add about 30\r\ncc. of redistilled amyl alcohol. Connect the flask, the stopper of which\r\ncarries a thermometer, with a condenser[E] and boil until the\r\ntemperature rises approximately to the boiling point of amyl alcohol\r\n(130° C.), showing that all the water has been driven off. Cool slightly\r\nand add a drop of hydrochloric acid to convert small amounts of lithium\r\nhydroxide to lithium chloride. Connect with the condenser and continue\r\nthe boiling to drive off again all water and until the temperature\r\nreaches the boiling point of amyl alcohol. The content of the flask at\r\nthis time is usually 15 to 20 cc. Filter through a small paper or a\r\nGooch crucible into a graduated cylinder and note exact quantity of\r\nfiltrate, which determines the subsequent correction. Wash the\r\nprecipitate with small quantities of dehydrated amyl alcohol. Evaporate\r\nthe filtrate and washings in a platinum dish to dryness on the steam\r\nbath, dissolve the residue in water, and add a few drops of sulfuric\r\nacid. Evaporate on a steam bath and expel the excess of sulfuric acid by\r\ngentle heat over a flame. Repeat until carbonaceous matter is completely\r\nburned off. Cool and weigh the dish and contents. Dissolve in a small\r\nquantity of hot water, filter through a small filter, wash, and return\r\nfilter to dish, ignite, and weigh. The difference between the original\r\nweight of dish and contents and the weight of the dish and small amount\r\nof residue equals the weight of impure lithium sulfate. The purity of\r\nthe lithium sulfate should be tested by adding small amounts of ammonium\r\nphosphate and ammonium hydroxide, which will precipitate any magnesium\r\npresent with the lithium sulfate. Any precipitate appearing after\r\nstanding over night should be collected on a small filter and weighed as\r\nmagnesium pyrophosphate, calculated to sulfate, and subtracted from the\r\nweight of impure lithium sulfate. From this weight subtract 0.00113 gram\r\nfor every 10 cc. of amyl alcohol filtrate exclusive of the amyl alcohol\r\nused in washing residue because of the slight solubility of solid mixed\r\nchlorides in amyl alcohol. Calculate lithium from the corrected weight\r\nof lithium sulfate. Dissolve the mixed chlorides from flask and filter\r\nwith hot water, evaporate to dryness, ignite gently to remove amyl\r\nalcohol, filter and thoroughly wash; concentrate the filtrates and\r\nwashings to 25 to 50 cc.\r\n\r\nFootnote E:\r\n\r\n  The amyl alcohol may be boiled off without the use of a condenser, but\r\n  the vapors are very disagreeable.\r\n\r\nTo the weight of potassium chloride add 0.00051 gram for every 10 cc. of\r\namyl alcohol used in the extraction of the lithium chloride, which\r\ncorrects for the solubility of the potassium chloride in amyl alcohol.\r\nCalculate to potassium.\r\n\r\nThe weight of sodium chloride is found by subtracting the combined\r\nweights of lithium chloride and potassium chloride (corrected) from the\r\ntotal weight of the three chlorides. Calculate sodium chloride to\r\nsodium.\r\n\r\n\r\n               BROMINE, IODINE, ARSENIC, AND BORIC ACID.\r\n\r\nEvaporate to dryness a large quantity of the sample to which a small\r\namount of sodium carbonate has been added. Boil the residue with\r\ndistilled water, transfer it to a filter, and thoroughly wash it with\r\nhot water. Dilute the alkaline filtrate to a definite volume, and\r\ndetermine bromine and iodine, arsenic, and boric acid in aliquot\r\nportions of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BROMINE AND IODINE.[10]\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—1. Sulfuric acid. 1 to 5.\r\n\r\n2. Potassium nitrite or sodium nitrite. Two per cent solution.\r\n\r\n3. Carbon bisulfide. Freshly purified by distillation.\r\n\r\n4. Iodine standards. Acidify with dilute sulfuric acid measured\r\nquantities of a standard solution of potassium iodide in small tubes.\r\nAdd 3 or 4 drops of the potassium nitrite solution and extract with\r\ncarbon bisulfide as in the actual determination. Transfer to small\r\nflasks the standards from which the iodine has been removed.\r\n\r\n5. Chlorine water. Saturated solution.\r\n\r\n6. Bromine standards. Add measured quantities of a standard solution of\r\na bromide to the liquid in each of the small flasks from which the\r\niodine has been removed. Add to each 5 cc. of purified carbon bisulfide,\r\nand proceed exactly as with the sample.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Evaporate to dryness an aliquot portion of the alkaline\r\nfiltrate. Dissolve the residue in 2 or 3 cc. of water, and add enough\r\nabsolute alcohol to make the percentage of alcohol about 90. Boil and\r\nfilter and repeat the extraction of the residue with alcohol once or\r\ntwice. Add 2 or 3 drops of sodium hydroxide to the combined alcoholic\r\nfiltrates and evaporate to dryness. Dissolve the residue in 2 or 3 cc.\r\nof water and repeat the extraction with alcohol and the filtration. Add\r\na drop of sodium hydroxide to the filtrate and evaporate it to dryness.\r\nDissolve the residue in a little water. Acidify this solution with\r\ndilute sulfuric acid, adding 3 or 4 drops excess, and transfer it to a\r\nsmall flask. Add 4 drops of the solution of potassium nitrite or sodium\r\nnitrite and about 5 cc. of carbon bisulfide. Shake the mixture until all\r\nthe iodine is extracted. Separate the acid solution from the carbon\r\nbisulfide by filtration. Wash the flask, filter, and contents with cold\r\ndistilled water, and transfer the carbon bisulfide containing the iodine\r\nin solution to Nessler tubes by means of about 5 cc. of pure carbon\r\nbisulfide. In washing the filter, dilute the contents of the tube to a\r\ndefinite volume, usually 12 or 15 cc., and compare the color with that\r\nof known amounts of iodine dissolved in carbon bisulfide in other tubes.\r\n\r\nTransfer to a small flask the sample from which the iodine has been\r\nremoved. Add saturated chlorine water, 1 cc. at a time, shaking after\r\neach addition until all the bromine is freed. Care must be taken not to\r\nadd much more chlorine than that necessary to free the bromine, since an\r\nexcess of reagent may form a bromochloride that spoils the color\r\nreaction. Separate the water solution from the carbon bisulfide by\r\nfiltration through a moistened filter, wash the contents of the filter\r\ntwo or three times with water, and then transfer them to a Nessler tube\r\nby means of about 1 cc. of carbon bisulfide. Repeat this extraction of\r\nthe filtrate twice, using 3 cc. of carbon bisulfide each time. The\r\ncombined carbon bisulfide extracts usually amount to 11.5 to 12 cc. Add\r\nenough carbon bisulfide to the tubes to bring them to a definite volume,\r\nusually 12 to 15 cc., and compare the sample with the standards. If much\r\nbromine is present it is not always completely extracted by the amounts\r\nof carbon bisulfide recommended. If the extraction is incomplete,\r\ntherefore, make one or two extra extractions with carbon bisulfide,\r\ntransfer the extracts to another tube, and compare the color with that\r\nof the standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ARSENIC.[31]\r\n\r\nEvaporate to dryness an aliquot portion of the alkaline filtrate (p.\r\n61). Acidify the residue with arsenic-free sulfuric acid, and subject it\r\nto the action of arsenic-free zinc and sulfuric acid in a\r\nMarsh-Berzelius apparatus. Compare the mirror obtained with a mirror\r\nobtained from an arsenious oxide solution of known strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BORIC ACID.\r\n\r\nEvaporate to dryness an aliquot portion of the alkaline filtrate (p.\r\n61), treat the residue with 1 or 2 cc. of water, and slightly acidify\r\nthe solution with hydrochloric acid. Add about 25 cc. of absolute\r\nalcohol, boil, filter, and repeat the extraction of the residue. Make\r\nthe filtrate slightly alkaline with sodium hydroxide, and evaporate it\r\nto dryness. Add a little water, slightly acidify with hydrochloric acid,\r\nand place a strip of turmeric paper in the liquid. Evaporate to dryness\r\non the steam bath, and continue the heating until the turmeric paper is\r\ndry. If boric acid is present the turmeric paper becomes cherry red. It\r\nis not usually necessary to determine quantitatively boric acid; the\r\nquantitative method devised by Gooch[33] is recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HYDROGEN SULFIDE.[103]\r\n\r\nHydrogen sulfide should be determined preferably in the field; the\r\nprocedure as far as the final titration with sodium thiosulfate must be\r\ncarried out in the field.\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—1. N/100 sodium thiosulfate.\r\n\r\n2. Standard iodine. A N/100 solution containing potassium iodide\r\nstandardized against the N/100 sodium thiosulfate. To standardize, add\r\n10 cc. of the iodine solution to 500 cc. of boiled distilled water. Add\r\nabout 1 gram of potassium iodide, and titrate with N/100 sodium\r\nthiosulfate in the presence of starch indicator. One cc. of N/100 iodine\r\nis equivalent to 0.17 mg. H_{2}S.\r\n\r\n3. Potassium iodide. Crystals.\r\n\r\n4. Starch. A freshly prepared solution for use as indicator.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Add 500 cc. of the sample to 10 cc. of the standard iodine\r\nsolution and 1 gram of potassium iodide in a large glass-stoppered\r\nbottle or flask. If the sample is to be collected from a tap lead the\r\nwater into the bottle through a rubber tube extending to the bottom of\r\nthe bottle so as to eliminate errors due to aeration. Shake the bottle,\r\nallow it to stand for a few minutes, and then titrate the excess of\r\niodine with sodium thiosulfate in the presence of starch indicator.\r\nHydrogen sulfide (H_{2}S) in parts per million is equal to 0.34 times\r\nthe difference in cubic centimeters between the amount of iodine\r\nsolution added and the amount of N/100 thiosulfate used in the\r\ntitration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHLORINE.\r\n\r\nIn waters that have been treated with calcium hypochlorite or liquid\r\nchlorine it is frequently advisable to ascertain the presence or absence\r\nof chlorine. As the reagents which have been proposed for its detection\r\nare not specific for chlorine but give similar or identical reactions\r\nwith oxidizing agents or reducible substances care must be exercised in\r\ninterpreting the results of such tests: nitrites and ferric salts are of\r\ncommon occurrence, and chlorates also may lead to misinterpretation in\r\nwaters treated with calcium hypochlorite.\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—1. Tolidin solution. One gram of o-tolidin, purified by\r\nbeing recrystallized from alcohol, is dissolved in 1 liter of 10 per\r\ncent hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n2. Copper sulfate solution. Dissolve 1.5 grams of copper sulfate and 1\r\ncc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in distilled water and dilute the\r\nsolution to 100 cc.\r\n\r\n3. Potassium bichromate solution. Dissolve 0.025 gram of potassium\r\nbichromate and 0.1 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in distilled water\r\nand dilute the solution to 100 cc.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Mix 1 cc. of the tolidin reagent with 100 cc. of the sample\r\nin a Nessler tube and allow the solution to stand at least 5 minutes.\r\nSmall amounts of free chlorine give a yellow and larger amounts an\r\norange color.\r\n\r\nFor quantitative determination compare the color with that of standards\r\nin similar tubes prepared from the solutions of copper sulfate and\r\npotassium bichromate. The amounts of solution for various standards are\r\nindicated in Table 13.\r\n\r\n  Table 13.—PREPARATION OF PERMANENT STANDARDS FOR CONTENT OF CHLORINE.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────┬───────────────────────┬───────────────────────\r\n        Chlorine.       │  Solution of copper   │ Solution of potassium\r\n                        │       sulfate.        │      bichromate.\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────────────────\r\n  _Parts per million._  │         _cc._         │         _cc._\r\n                        │                       │\r\n                    0.01│                    0.0│                    0.8\r\n                     .02│                     .0│                    2.1\r\n                     .03│                     .0│                    3.2\r\n                     .04│                     .0│                    4.3\r\n                     .05│                     .4│                    5.5\r\n                     .06│                     .8│                    6.6\r\n                     .07│                    1.2│                    7.5\r\n                     .08│                    1.5│                    8.7\r\n                     .09│                    1.7│                    9.0\r\n                     .10│                    1.8│                   10.0\r\n                     .20│                    1.9│                   20.0\r\n                     .30│                    1.9│                   30.0\r\n                     .40│                    2.0│                   38.0\r\n                     .50│                    2.0│                   45.0\r\n ───────────────────────┴───────────────────────┴───────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n           DISSOLVED OXYGEN.[16][65][68][71b][99][100c][120]\r\n\r\n_Reagents._—1. Sulfuric acid, concentrated. (Sp. gr. 1.83–1.84.)\r\n\r\n2. Potassium permanganate. Dissolve 6.32 grams of the salt in water and\r\ndilute the solution to 1 liter.\r\n\r\n3. Potassium oxalate. A 2 per cent solution.\r\n\r\n4. Manganous sulfate. Dissolve 480 grams of the salt in water and dilute\r\nthe solution to 1 liter.\r\n\r\n5. Alkaline potassium iodide. Dissolve 700 grams of potassium hydroxide\r\nand 150 grams of potassium iodide in water and dilute the solution to 1\r\nliter.\r\n\r\n6. Hydrochloric acid. Concentrated (Sp. gr. 1.18–1.19).\r\n\r\n7. Sodium thiosulfate. A N/40 solution. Dissolve 6.2 grams of chemically\r\npure recrystallized sodium thiosulfate in water and dilute the solution\r\nto 1 liter with freshly boiled distilled water. Each cc. is equivalent\r\nto 0.2 mg. of oxygen or to 0.1395 cc. of oxygen at 0°C. and 760 mm.\r\npressure. Inasmuch as this solution is not permanent it should be\r\nstandardized occasionally against a N/40 solution of potassium\r\nbichromate. The keeping qualities of the thiosulfate solution are\r\nimproved by adding to each liter 5 cc. of chloroform and 1.5 grams of\r\nammonium carbonate before diluting to the prescribed volume.\r\n\r\n8. Starch solution. Mix a small amount of clean starch with cold water\r\nuntil it becomes a thin paste and stir this mass into 150 to 200 times\r\nits weight of boiling water. Boil for a few minutes, then sterilize. It\r\nmay be preserved by adding a few drops of chloroform.\r\n\r\n_Collection of sample._—Collect the sample in a narrow-necked\r\nglass-stoppered bottle of 250 to 270 cc. capacity. The following\r\nprocedure should be followed in order to avoid entrainment or absorption\r\nof atmospheric oxygen. In collecting from a tap fill the bottle through\r\na glass or rubber tube extending well into the tap and to the bottom of\r\nthe bottle. To avoid air bubbles allow the bottle to overflow for\r\nseveral minutes, and then carefully replace the glass stopper so that no\r\nair bubble is entrained. In collecting from the surface of a pond or\r\ntank connect the sample bottle to a bottle of 1 liter capacity. Provide\r\neach bottle with a two-hole rubber stopper having one glass tube\r\nextending to the bottom and another glass tube entering but not\r\nprojecting into the bottle. Connect the short tube of the sample bottle\r\nwith the long tube of the liter bottle. Immerse the sample bottle in the\r\nwater and apply suction to the outlet of the liter bottle. To collect a\r\nsample at any depth arrange the two bottles so that the outlet tube of\r\nthe liter bottle is at a higher elevation then the inlet tube of the\r\nsample bottle. Lower the two bottles, in any convenient form of cage\r\nproperly weighted, to the desired depth. Water entering during the\r\ndescent will be flushed through into the liter bottle. When air bubbles\r\ncease rising to the surface raise the bottles. Finally replace the\r\nperforated stopper of the sample bottle with a glass stopper in such\r\nmanner as to avoid entraining bubbles of air.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Remove the stopper from the bottle and add, first, 0.7 cc.\r\nof the concentrated sulfuric acid, and then 1 cc. of the potassium\r\npermanganate solution. These and all other reagents should be introduced\r\nby pipette under the surface of the liquid. Insert the stopper and mix\r\nby inverting the bottle several times. After 20 minutes have elapsed\r\ndestroy the excess of permanganate by adding 1 cc. of the potassium\r\noxalate solution, the bottle being at once restoppered and its contents\r\nmixed. If a noticeable excess of potassium permanganate is not present\r\nat the end of 20 minutes, again add 1 cc. of the potassium permanganate\r\nsolution. If this is still insufficient use a stronger potassium\r\npermanganate solution. After the liquid has been decolorized by the\r\naddition of potassium oxalate add 1 cc. of the manganous sulfate\r\nsolution and 3 cc. of the alkaline potassium iodide solution. Allow the\r\nprecipitate to settle. Add 2 cc. of the hydrochloric acid and mix by\r\nshaking.\r\n\r\nThe procedure to this point must be carried out in the field, but after\r\nthe acid has been added and the stopper replaced there is no further\r\nchange, and the rest of the test may be performed within a few hours, as\r\nconvenient. Transfer 200 cc. of the contents of the bottle to a flask\r\nand titrate with N/40 sodium thiosulfate, using a few cubic centimeters\r\nof the starch solution as indicator toward the end of the titration. Do\r\nnot add the starch solution until the color has become faint yellow, and\r\ntitrate until the blue color disappears.\r\n\r\nThe use of potassium permanganate is made necessary by high nitrite or\r\norganic matter. The procedure outlined must be followed in all work on\r\nsewage and partly purified effluents or seriously polluted streams or\r\nsamples whose nitrite nitrogen exceeds 0.1 part per million. In testing\r\nother samples the procedure may be shortened by beginning with the\r\naddition of the manganous sulfate solution and proceeding from that\r\npoint as outlined, except that only 1 cc. of alkaline potassium iodide\r\nneed be added.\r\n\r\n_Calculation of Results._—Oxygen shall be reported in parts per million\r\nby weight. It is sometimes convenient to know the number of cubic\r\ncentimeters per liter of the gas at 0°C. temperature and 760 mm.\r\npressure and also to know the percentage which the amount of gas present\r\nis of the maximum amount capable of being dissolved by distilled water\r\nat the same temperature and pressure. If 200 cc. of the sample is taken\r\nthe number of cubic centimeters of N/40 thiosulfate used is equal to\r\nparts per million of oxygen. Corrections for volume of reagents added\r\namount to less than 3 per cent and are not justified except in work of\r\nunusual precision. To obtain the result in cubic centimeters per liter\r\nmultiply the number of cubic centimeters of thiosulfate used by 0.698.\r\nTo obtain the result in percentage of saturation divide the number of\r\ncubic centimeters of thiosulfate by the figure in Table 14 opposite the\r\ntemperature of the water and under the proper chlorine figure. The last\r\ncolumn of Table 14 permits interpolation for intermediate chlorine\r\nvalues. At elevations differing considerably from mean sea level and for\r\naccurate work attention must be given to barometric pressure, the normal\r\npressure in the region being preferable to the specific pressure at the\r\ntime of sampling. The term “saturation” refers to a condition of\r\nequilibrium between the solution and an oxygen pressure in the\r\natmosphere corresponding to 158.8 millimeters, or approximately\r\none-fifth atmosphere.

By means of a rubber-tipped glass rod remove to\r\nthe bottom of the dish the solid matter attached to the sides, and add\r\nnormal sulfuric acid to neutralize the alkalinity. Do not use an excess\r\nof acid. Then evaporate the contents of the dish to dryness. Treat the\r\ndry residue with boiling ether, rubbing the bottom and sides of the dish\r\nto insure complete solution of fat. Three extractions with ether are\r\nrequired. Filter the ether solution through a 5 cm. filter into a\r\nweighed flask having a wide mouth. Evaporate the ether slowly, and dry\r\nthe flask at 100° C. for 30 minutes. The increase in weight of the flask\r\ngives the amount of fats, or, in more precise language, the\r\nether-soluble matter.\r\n\r\nAn excess of acid gives too high results because of the formation of\r\nfatty-acid residues.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  RELATIVE STABILITY OF EFFLUENTS.[78]\r\n\r\n_Reagent._—Methylene blue solution. A 0.05 per cent aqueous solution of\r\nmethylene blue, preferably the double zinc salt or commercial\r\nvariety.[60b]\r\n\r\n_Collection of sample._—Collect the sample in a glass-stoppered bottle\r\nholding approximately 150 cc. If the dissolved oxygen is low observe\r\nprecautions similar to those used in collecting samples for dissolved\r\noxygen (p. 66).\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Add 0.4 cc. of the methylene blue solution to the sample in\r\nthe 150 cc. bottle. As methylene blue has a slightly antiseptic property\r\nbe careful to add exactly 0.4 cc. Add the methylene blue solution\r\npreferably below the surface of the liquid after filling the bottle with\r\nthe sample. If the methylene blue is added first do not allow the liquid\r\nto overflow as coloring matter will thus be lost. Incubate the sample at\r\n20° C. for ten days. Four days’ incubation may be considered sufficient\r\nfor all practical purposes in routine plant-control work. If quick\r\nresults are desired incubate the sample at 37° C. for five days using\r\nsuitable stoppers[1a][2a] to prevent the loss and reabsorption of\r\ndissolved oxygen. The bacterial flora at 37° C. is different from that\r\nat 20° C. The lower temperature is more nearly the average temperature\r\nof surface waters and therefore the higher temperature should be used\r\nonly when quick approximate results are essential. Observe the sample at\r\nleast twice a day during incubation. Give a sample in which the\r\nmethylene blue becomes decolorized a relative stability corresponding to\r\nthe time required for reduction (see Table 15). For routine filter\r\ncontrol ordinary room or cellar temperature gives fairly satisfactory\r\nresults. For accurate studies, room temperature incubation is very\r\nundesirable, as the fluctuations in temperature which are ordinarily not\r\nnoticed are responsible for appreciable deviations from the true values\r\nof relative stability. If the samples are incubated less than 10 days at\r\n20° C. and are not decolorized place a plus sign after the stability\r\nvalue in order to indicate that the stability might have been higher if\r\nmore time had been allowed. In applying this test to river waters it\r\noften happens that the blue coloring matter is removed either partly or\r\ncompletely through absorption by the clay which many rivers carry in\r\nsuspension. True relative stabilities cannot be obtained for such waters\r\nexcept by determining the initial available oxygen at the start and the\r\nbiochemical oxygen demand on incubation at 20° C. for 10 days (pp.\r\n71–73). Germicides, such as hypochlorite of lime, if present in\r\nsufficient quantity, vitiate the results. If a sample contains free\r\nchlorine, therefore, store it about 2 hours, or until the chlorine is\r\ngone, and then add methylene blue.\r\n\r\nTable 15[78] gives the relation between the time in days to decolorize\r\nmethylene blue at 20° C. (_t__{20}) and the relative stability number or\r\nratio of available oxygen to oxygen required for equilibrium, expressed\r\nin percentage (S).\r\n\r\n                  Table 15.—RELATIVE STABILITY NUMBERS.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────\r\n Time required for decolorization at│        Relative stability.\r\n               20° C.               │\r\n ───────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────\r\n               _Days._              │           _Percentage._\r\n                                 0.5│                                 11\r\n                                 1.0│                                 21\r\n                                 1.5│                                 30\r\n                                 2.0│                                 37\r\n                                 2.5│                                 44\r\n                                 3.0│                                 50\r\n                                 4.0│                                 60\r\n                                 5.0│                                 68\r\n                                 6.0│                                 75\r\n                                 7.0│                                 80\r\n                                 8.0│                                 84\r\n                                 9.0│                                 87\r\n                                10.0│                                 90\r\n                                11.0│                                 92\r\n                                12.0│                                 94\r\n                                13.0│                                 95\r\n                                14.0│                                 96\r\n                                16.0│                                 97\r\n                                18.0│                                 98\r\n                                20.0│                                 99\r\n ───────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\nThe theoretical relation is, S = 100 (1 − 0.794_t__{20})\r\n\r\nThe relation between the time of reduction at 20° C. and that at 37° C.\r\nis approximately two to one, but if an observer incubates at 37° C. he\r\nshould work out his own comparative 37° C. table or factor.\r\n\r\nA relative stability of 75 signifies that the sample examined contains a\r\nsupply of available oxygen equal to 75 per cent of the amount of oxygen\r\nwhich it requires in order to become perfectly stable. The available\r\noxygen is approximately equivalent to the dissolved oxygen plus the\r\navailable oxygen of nitrate and nitrite. Nitrite in sewage is usually so\r\nlow as to be negligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n   BIOCHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND OF SEWAGE AND EFFLUENTS.[60a][60c][60d]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       RELATIVE STABILITY METHOD.\r\n\r\nThe relative stability method may be employed to obtain a measure of the\r\nputrescible material in sewages and effluents in terms of oxygen demand.\r\n\r\n_Procedure for effluents._—Divide the total available oxygen, including\r\nthe oxygen of nitrite and nitrate, by the relative stability expressed\r\nas a decimal.\r\n\r\n_Procedure for sewages._—Make one or two dilutions with fully aerated\r\ndistilled water of known dissolved oxygen content. Tap water may be\r\nemployed if it is free from nitrates. Vary the relative proportions of\r\nsewage and water to be employed to give a relative stability of 50 to\r\n75. Unless seals[1b][2b][52a] are used bring the water as well as the\r\nsewage to the temperature at which the mixtures are to be incubated\r\nbefore preparing the dilutions. During the manipulation avoid aeration.\r\nHaving made the proper dilutions, determine the relative stability of\r\neach.\r\n\r\nCalculate the oxygen demand in parts per million by the formula:\r\n\r\n                      Oxygen demand = O(1 − p)/Rp\r\n\r\nIn this formula, O is the initial dissolved oxygen of the diluting\r\nwater, p is the proportion of sewage; and R is the relative stability of\r\nthe mixture. Ordinarily the available oxygen in crude sewages, septic\r\ntank effluents, settling tank effluents, and trade wastes can be\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SODIUM NITRATE METHOD.\r\n\r\nFor the determination of the biochemical oxygen demand the sodium\r\nnitrate method may be used[60a][60c][60d][52a]. The method is based on\r\nthe biochemical consumption of oxygen from sodium nitrate by a sewage or\r\npolluted water during an incubation period of ten days at 20° C. A\r\nreasonable excess of sodium nitrate does not give a higher oxygen\r\ndemand, as do higher dilutions with aerated water. The oxygen absorbed\r\nfrom the air in applying the method to sewages is negligible.\r\n\r\n_Reagent._—Sodium nitrate solution. Dissolve 26.56 grams of pure sodium\r\nnitrate in 1 liter of distilled water. One cc. of this solution in 250\r\ncc. of sewage represents 50 parts per million of available oxygen. The\r\nstrength of the sodium nitrate solution may be varied to suit\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n_Procedure for sewages._—Ordinarily disregard the initial available\r\noxygen as it is very small compared with the total biochemical oxygen\r\ndemand. Add measured amounts of the sodium nitrate solution to the\r\nsewage in bottles holding approximately 250 cc. which have been\r\ncompletely filled and stoppered. Incubate for 10 days at 20° C. A seal\r\nis not required during incubation. The appearance of a black sediment\r\nand the development of a putrid odor during incubation indicates that\r\ntoo little sodium nitrate has been added. Methylene blue solution in\r\nproper proportion may be added at the start to serve as an indicator\r\nduring the incubation. Domestic sewage usually varies in its oxygen\r\ndemand from 100 to 300 parts per million, approximately 30 per cent of\r\nwhich is used up at 20° C. in the first 24 hours. At the end of the\r\nincubation period determine the residual nitrite and nitrate. Determine\r\nthe nitrate by the aluminium reduction method and direct Nesslerization.\r\nTo convert the nitrogen into oxygen equivalents, multiply the nitrite\r\nnitrogen by 1.7 and the nitrate nitrogen by 2.9. The difference between\r\nthe available oxygen added as sodium nitrate and that found as nitrite\r\nand nitrate at the end of the incubation period is the biochemical\r\noxygen demand.\r\n\r\n_Procedure for industrial wastes._—Employ the same procedure using\r\nlarger quantities of the sodium nitrate solution. Make the reaction\r\nalkaline to methyl orange and acid to phenolphthalein. Adjust an acid\r\nreaction with sodium bicarbonate and a caustic alkaline reaction with\r\nweak hydrochloric acid. If the liquid is devoid of sewage bacteria seed\r\nit with sewage after adjusting the reaction.\r\n\r\n_Procedure for polluted river waters._—Determine the initial available\r\noxygen. Unless the river water is badly polluted add 10 parts per\r\nmillion of sodium nitrate oxygen. Collect carefully, avoiding aeration,\r\nthree samples in 250 cc. bottles. To one sample add a definite quantity\r\nof sodium nitrate solution and incubate. Incubate the other two samples\r\nfor the determination of the residual free oxygen, nitrite, and nitrate.\r\nIf there is free oxygen left, the bottle containing the sodium nitrate\r\nsolution may be discarded. If there is no free oxygen determine residual\r\nnitrite and nitrate as directed under the procedure for sewage (p. 72)\r\nand calculate the oxygen demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              ANALYSIS OF SEWAGE SLUDGE AND MUD DEPOSITS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         COLLECTION OF SAMPLE.\r\n\r\nCollect a representative sample of the material. In general more than\r\none sample should be taken from a spot and a large number of samples\r\nshould be collected rather than a few large samples. If the surface\r\nlayer is darker and a lower layer consists of pure clay sample only the\r\nsurface layer. Samples may be analyzed either separately or as\r\ncomposites of careful mixtures. After the sample has settled a few\r\nminutes roughly drain or siphon the excess water. Allow sewage sludge to\r\nstand for one hour before draining it free from excess water unless it\r\nis essential to determine the moisture content of the sample originally\r\ncollected. If sludge cannot be analyzed within twenty-four hours it is\r\nbetter not to use air-tight bottles and to add small quantities of\r\nchloroform and keep in the ice box to retard decomposition. At the time\r\nof collection carefully examine mud from the bottom of surface water for\r\nevidence of sewage pollution and macroscopic and microscopic animal and\r\nplant organisms. Record the predominant species. Note the physical\r\nappearance of the material, particularly its color, odor, and\r\nconsistency. Express all analytical results in percentage on a dry\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               REACTION.\r\n\r\nDetermine the reaction by diluting a definite quantity of the wet sludge\r\nand titrating by the methods given under alkalinity and acidity (pp.\r\n35–39 and 39–41).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SPECIFIC GRAVITY.\r\n\r\nWeigh to the nearest tenth of a gram a wide-mouthed flask of 100 to 300\r\ncc. capacity, according to the quantity of material available. Then\r\ncompletely fill the flask with distilled water to the brim and weigh it\r\nagain. Empty the flask and fill it completely with fresh sewage sludge\r\nor mud. If the material is of such consistency that it flows readily\r\nfill the flask to the brim and weigh. The specific gravity is equal to\r\nthe weight of the sludge or mud divided by the weight of an equal volume\r\nof distilled water.\r\n\r\nIf the material does not flow readily fill the weighed flask as\r\ncompletely as possible without exerting pressure during the procedure.\r\nWeigh and then fill the flask to the brim with distilled water. Let it\r\nstand for a few minutes, until trapped air has escaped, then add more\r\nwater if necessary and weigh. Subtract the weight of the added water\r\nfrom the weight of the water that completely fills the flask; the\r\nspecific gravity is equal to the weight of the material divided by this\r\ndifference. Record the specific gravity only to the second decimal\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MOISTURE.\r\n\r\nHeat approximately 25 grams of sludge or mud in a weighed nickel dish on\r\nthe water bath until it is fairly dry. Dry the residue in an oven at\r\n100° C., cool, and weigh. Repeat to approximate constant weight. The\r\nloss in weight is moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       VOLATILE AND FIXED MATTER.\r\n\r\nIgnite, at dull red heat in a hood, the residue from the determination\r\nof moisture until all the carbon has disappeared. Cool the residue in a\r\ndesiccator and weigh it. The residue is the fixed matter. The volatile\r\nmatter is the difference in weight between the original dried sludge and\r\nthe ignited sludge.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TOTAL ORGANIC NITROGEN.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of sample._—For the determination of organic nitrogen and\r\nfats dry approximately 50 to 75 grams of the sludge or mud in a\r\nporcelain dish first on the water bath and finally in the hot-water oven\r\nuntil all the moisture has disappeared. Grind the dry material to a fine\r\npowder and keep it in a glass-stoppered bottle.\r\n\r\n       _Reagents._—1. Sulfuric acid. Concentrated, nitrogen-free.\r\n                   2. Copper sulfate solution. Ten per cent.\r\n                   3. Potassium permanganate. Crystals.\r\n\r\n_First procedure._—Weigh accurately 0.5 gram of dried sludge or 5.0\r\ngrams of dried mud and put it into a 500 cc. Kjeldahl flask. Digest it\r\nwith 20 cc. of sulfuric acid, or more if necessary, and 1 cc. of copper\r\nsulfate solution to assist the oxidation. Boil for several hours until\r\nthe liquid becomes colorless or slightly yellow. Oxidize the residue\r\nwith 0.5 gram of potassium permanganate, and follow the “Procedure for\r\nSewage” (pp. 21–22).\r\n\r\n_Second procedure._—The following method is convenient for routine work\r\nat sewage disposal plants. After digestion as described in the first\r\nprocedure, cool, transfer to a glass-stoppered 100 cc. flask, dilute\r\nwith distilled water to 100 cc., and mix well. Transfer 50 cc. with a\r\npipette into another 100 cc. volumetric flask, and make this portion\r\nalkaline with 50 per cent sodium hydroxide, testing a drop of the liquid\r\non a porcelain plate with phenolphthalein to insure neutralization. The\r\nformation of a floc usually indicates that neutralization is complete.\r\nDilute the solution to 100 cc., pour it into a small glass-stoppered\r\nbottle and permit it to stand until the next day. Nesslerize an aliquot\r\nportion of the clear supernatant liquid, and calculate the percentage of\r\nnitrogen in the material.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ETHER-SOLUBLE MATTER.\r\n\r\nFats are usually determined only on sewage sludge, but some mud deposits\r\ncontain small quantities due to the presence of trade wastes.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Weigh 0.5 to 25 grams of dry material according to the\r\nquality of the sludge or mud. Add water to the weighed portion in a\r\nporcelain dish and acidify the mixture with N/50 sulfuric acid in the\r\npresence of litmus tincture or azolitmin solution as indicator. Avoid\r\nadding too much acid as an excess gives too high results on account of\r\nfatty acid residues. Evaporate the acidified mixture to dryness on the\r\nwater bath, and heat it in the hot air oven at 100° C. two to three\r\nhours. Extract the dry residue with boiling ether, rubbing the sides and\r\nbottom of the dish to insure complete solution of the fat. Three\r\nextractions with ether are usually sufficient. Filter the ether solution\r\nthrough a 5 cm. filter paper into a small flask. Evaporate the ether\r\nslowly, dry the fatty extract for half an hour at 100° C., cool in a\r\ndesiccator, and weigh. If it is desirable, particularly with certain\r\nindustrial wastes, to determine the quantity of saponified fat determine\r\nthe fats with and without the addition of acid. The difference between\r\nthe quantities found by the two determinations is the content of\r\nsaponified fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FERROUS SULFIDE.\r\n\r\nThe liberation of hydrogen sulfide on adding dilute hydrochloric acid to\r\na sludge indicates the presence of ferrous sulfide. As ferrous sulfide\r\nquickly oxidizes on exposure to air a quantitative determination of this\r\nconstituent must be made immediately after collection of the sample.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Heat a definite portion of the sludge with hydrochloric\r\nacid in a flask. Pass the liberated gas through bromine water or\r\nhydrogen peroxide. Determine gravimetrically the sulfate in the\r\noxidizing solution, and calculate the equivalent of ferrous sulfide by\r\nmultiplying the weight of barium sulfate by 0.376.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BIOCHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of river mud most suitable for the determination of the\r\nbiochemical oxygen demand ranges within certain limits, largely\r\naccording to the amount of oxidizable matter present. For examinations\r\nof river mud prepare a 1 per cent stock suspension in distilled water or\r\ntap water saturated with oxygen and free from nitrate; use in the test a\r\ndilution of this stock suspension equivalent to a concentration of 1 to\r\n10 grams per liter of mud. For examinations of fresh sewage sludge\r\nprepare a 1 per cent stock suspension in a similar manner, but use in\r\nthe test a dilution equivalent to only 0.1 to 1.0 gram per liter of wet\r\nmaterial. For examinations of dried sludges, which have undergone more\r\nor less oxidation higher concentrations may be required.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Place a measured portion of the sample, or the proper\r\namount of the 1 per cent stock suspension of the sample, in a 300 cc.\r\nnarrow-mouth glass-stoppered bottle, and dilute it to the desired\r\nconcentration with water saturated with oxygen. Determine the oxygen\r\ncontent at 20° C. of the waters that are used for dilution. This\r\ndetermination must be made before the mud or sludge is added because\r\niron sulfide in the mud or sludge rapidly consumes part of the dissolved\r\noxygen. Incubate at 20° C. for five days.\r\n\r\nShortly before the determination of the oxygen remaining in solution at\r\nthe end of five days rotate the bottle once or twice to mix its contents\r\nand allow sedimentation for about 30 minutes. Siphon the greater part of\r\nthe liquid through a narrow-bore siphon into a 150 cc. bottle, which has\r\nbeen filled with carbon dioxide. Reject the first 25 cc. of the siphoned\r\nliquid and allow a little to overflow at the end of siphoning. Determine\r\nthe oxygen content of the solution in the bottle in the usual way (pp.\r\n65–68). Report the oxygen demand in percentage of the dried mud or\r\nsludge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ANALYSIS OF CHEMICALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following sections describe the accepted methods for the analysis of\r\nthe chemicals commonly used in the treatment of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               REAGENTS.\r\n\r\n1. Distilled water. In practically all the tests of chemicals it is\r\nnecessary to use exclusively distilled water that has been freshly\r\nboiled to free it from carbon dioxide and oxygen.\r\n\r\n2. Concentrated hydrochloric acid. Sp. gr. 1.20.\r\n\r\n3. Hydrochloric acid, N/2.\r\n\r\n4. Hydrochloric acid, N/10.\r\n\r\n5. Ammonium hydroxide. Redistilled; sp. gr. 0.90.\r\n\r\n6. Dilute sulfuric acid. Dilute 1 part of concentrated sulfuric acid\r\nwith 3 parts of freshly boiled distilled water.\r\n\r\n7. Methyl orange indicator. See page 36.\r\n\r\n8. Phenolphthalein indicator. See page 36.\r\n\r\n9. Bromine water.\r\n\r\n10. Stannous chloride, N/20. This should be frequently standardized by\r\ntitration against a standard iron solution. One cc. of N/20 stannous\r\nchloride is equal to 0.0028 gram of iron (Fe) estimated in the ferrous\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n11. Sodium hydroxide, N/1. Free from carbonate. This should be\r\nfrequently standardized by titration against a standard acid solution in\r\npresence of phenolphthalein indicator. One cc. of N/1 sodium hydroxide\r\nis equal to 0.049 gram of sulfuric acid (H_{2}SO_{4}), or to 0.03645\r\ngram of hydrochloric acid (HCl).\r\n\r\n12. Sodium hydroxide, N/20. Free from carbonate.\r\n\r\n13. Standard potassium permanganate. A N/10 solution. One cc. of N/10\r\npotassium permanganate is equal to 0.0056 gram of iron (Fe) estimated in\r\nthe ferrous state.\r\n\r\n14. Alcohol. Ethyl alcohol, 95 per cent.\r\n\r\n15. Sugar. Solid granulated cane sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SULFATE OF ALUMINIUM.\r\n\r\nDetermine and report insoluble matter, aluminium oxide (Al_{2}O_{3}),\r\nferric oxide (Fe_{2}O_{3}), ferrous oxide (FeO), basicity ratio, and, if\r\npresent, free acid as H_{2}SO_{4}. If the material is what is known as\r\n“granular” sulfate mix it well before sampling. If it is in lump form\r\ncrush it to ⅛ to ¼ inch size, mix, and sample it. It is unnecessary to\r\ngrind the sample to a fine powder, but it is preferable to have the\r\nparticles fairly uniform in size.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           INSOLUBLE MATTER.\r\n\r\nTreat 10 grams of the sample with 100 cc. of distilled water and digest\r\none hour at boiling temperature. Filter through a weighed Gooch crucible\r\nand wash the insoluble matter with hot water freshly boiled to free it\r\nfrom carbon dioxide. Dry the crucible to constant weight at 100° C.,\r\ncool, and weigh. Report the percentage of insoluble matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     OXIDES OF IRON AND ALUMINIUM.\r\n\r\nDilute the filtrate from the determination of insoluble matter to 500\r\ncc. with water free from carbon dioxide and thoroughly mix the solution.\r\nTransfer 50 cc. of the solution to a 250 cc. beaker, add about 150 cc.\r\nof water and 5 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and heat to\r\nboiling. Add ammonium hydroxide in slight excess; when the solution has\r\nbeen almost neutralized it is convenient to add a drop of methyl orange\r\nindicator and then to add about 0.5 cc. of ammonium hydroxide after the\r\nsolution is neutral to the indicator. Digest at about 100° C. for a few\r\nminutes and filter. Some analysts prefer to wash this gelatinous\r\nprecipitate with hot water by decantation, and some to wash it evenly\r\ndistributed over the surface of a filter paper; either method may be\r\nused. It is difficult to free it completely from impurities and it is\r\nnot necessary to do so unless unusual quantities of calcium, magnesium,\r\nsodium, or potassium are present. While the precipitate is being washed\r\ndo not allow it to become dry, as it then packs and can not be washed\r\nclean. After most of the water has drained drying the filter may be\r\nhastened by placing it on a sheet of blotting paper. If much iron is\r\npresent completely dry the precipitate, remove it from the paper, and\r\nignite the paper separately. Finally, blast the precipitate, with free\r\naccess of air to the crucible, for five or ten minutes, cool, and weigh\r\nas oxides of iron and aluminium (Fe_{2}O_{3} + Al_{2}O_{3}).\r\n\r\nSubtract the content of total iron, expressed as ferric oxide\r\n(Fe_{2}O_{3}), from the weight of the combined oxides and report the\r\ndifference as aluminium oxide (Al_{2}O_{3}), in percentage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TOTAL IRON.\r\n\r\nAs filter alum usually contains 0.2 to 0.3 per cent of iron use a 10\r\ngram sample for the determination of total iron. Treat the sample with\r\n50 cc. of freshly boiled distilled water and add 5 cc. of concentrated\r\nhydrochloric acid and 1 cc. of bromine water. Evaporate the solution to\r\ndryness, dissolve the residue in water, and wash it into a flask with\r\nsufficient water to make the volume about 50 cc. Add 50 cc. of\r\nconcentrated hydrochloric acid, boil to expel oxygen, and titrate, as\r\nhot as possible, with N/20 stannous chloride.\r\n\r\nIf a 10 gram sample is used the percentage of iron (Fe) is equal to the\r\nnumber of cubic centimeters of stannous chloride used multiplied by\r\n0.028, and the percentage of iron expressed as ferric oxide is equal to\r\nthe number of cubic centimeters of stannous chloride used multiplied by\r\n0.040.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FERRIC IRON.\r\n\r\nAs filter alum usually contains 0.02 to 0.04 per cent of ferric iron use\r\na 20 gram sample. Boil 50 cc. of distilled water to expel oxygen, add 50\r\ncc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and add the sample while the\r\nsolution is boiling. Keep it boiling till the sample is dissolved. The\r\nflask should be kept filled with carbon dioxide during this process by\r\ndropping in occasionally small amounts of sodium carbonate. When\r\nsolution of the sample is complete titrate it hot immediately with N/20\r\nstannous chloride.\r\n\r\nIf a 20 gram sample is used the percentage of ferric oxide (Fe_{2}O_{3})\r\nis equal to the number of cubic centimeters of stannous chloride used\r\nmultiplied by 0.020.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FERROUS IRON.\r\n\r\nThe content of ferrous iron is the difference between total and ferric\r\niron. The percentage of ferrous oxide (FeO) is, therefore, equal to 0.90\r\ntimes the difference between the percentage of total iron expressed as\r\nferric oxide and the percentage of ferric iron expressed as ferric\r\noxide. Report the percentage of ferrous oxide (FeO).\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BASICITY RATIO.\r\n\r\nTransfer 50 cc. of the filtrate from the determination of insoluble\r\nmatter to a 200 cc. casserole and dilute it to 100 cc. Boil the solution\r\nand titrate it at boiling temperature with N/1 sodium hydroxide in\r\npresence of phenolphthalein indicator. The percentage of acidity in\r\nequivalent of sulfuric acid (H_{2}SO_{4}) is equal to the number of\r\ncubic centimeters of sodium hydroxide used multiplied by 4.9. In this\r\ntitration iron and aluminium are precipitated as hydroxides and any free\r\nacid is neutralized.\r\n\r\nCalculate the percentage of sulfuric acid equivalent to the determined\r\npercentages of aluminium oxide, ferric oxide, and ferrous oxide by the\r\nfollowing formula:\r\n\r\n            2.88 Al_{2}O_{3} + 1.83 Fe_{2}O_{3} + 1.36 FeO.\r\n\r\nIf this percentage of acid equivalent is less than that found by\r\ntitration report the difference as percentage of free acid. If the\r\npercentage of acid equivalent is greater than that found by titration\r\nthe difference divided by 2.88 is the percentage equivalent to the\r\nexcess of aluminium oxide present. Divide this excess by the percentage\r\nof total aluminium oxide and report the quotient as the basicity ratio.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LIME.\r\n\r\nMix well the sample, which should contain no lumps. If foreign matter is\r\npresent grind the sample to pass a 100–mesh sieve.\r\n\r\nPlace 20 grams of granulated cane sugar and 1 gram of the sample in a\r\n250 cc. glass-stoppered bottle, tightly stopped, and mix the mass by\r\nrolling. Do not shake hard as much of the lime could thus be lost as\r\ndust. Then add 187.4 cc. of distilled water freshly boiled to expel\r\ncarbon dioxide. This makes 200 cc. of sugar solution. The lime is mixed\r\ndry with the sugar and the water added later to keep the lime from\r\nlumping. After shaking the sugar solution one hour titrate 50 cc. of it\r\nwith N/2 hydrochloric acid in presence of methyl orange indicator. The\r\nacid used is equivalent to the carbonate and hydroxide in 0.25 gram of\r\nthe sample.\r\n\r\nFilter the remainder of the sugar solution, discarding the first 25 cc.\r\nof filtrate. Titrate 50 cc. of the filtrate with N/2 hydrochloric acid\r\nin presence of methyl orange indicator. The acid used is equivalent to\r\nthe hydroxide in 0.25 gram of the sample.\r\n\r\nIf a 1 gram sample is used the percentage of calcium oxide (CaO) is\r\nequal to 5.6 times the number of cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid\r\nused in the second titration; and the percentage of calcium carbonate\r\n(CaCO_{3}) equivalent to the carbonate present is equal to 10 times the\r\ndifference in cubic centimeters between the results of the two\r\ntitrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SULFATE OF IRON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           INSOLUBLE MATTER.\r\n\r\nTreat 10 grams of the sample with 100 cc. of freshly boiled distilled\r\nwater cooled to 30° C. or less. When solution is complete filter through\r\na weighed Gooch crucible, wash, dry, cool, and weigh. Report the weight\r\nof the residue, in percentage, as insoluble matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        IRON AS FERROUS SULFATE.\r\n\r\nDissolve 1 gram of the sample and dilute to 200 cc. with freshly boiled\r\ndistilled water cooled to 30° C. or less. Add 5 cc. of dilute sulfuric\r\nacid (1 to 3) to a 50 cc. portion of the solution and titrate with N/10\r\npotassium permanganate. The percentage of ferrous sulfate\r\n(FeSO_{4}.7H_{2}O) is equal to 11.12 times the number of cubic\r\ncentimeters of potassium permanganate used.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ACIDITY.\r\n\r\nShake 12.25 grams of the sample in a 150 cc. bottle with 75 cc. of 95\r\nper cent alcohol for ten minutes. Run a blank. Filter rapidly both\r\nsample and blank and wash rapidly with alcohol sufficient to make 100\r\ncc. of filtrate. Titrate with N/20 sodium hydroxide in presence of\r\nphenolphthalein and subtract the result of titrating the blank from that\r\nof titrating the solution of the sample. The percentage of acidity,\r\nexpressed as sulfuric acid (H_{2}SO_{4}), is equal to 0.02 times the\r\nnumber of cubic centimeters of sodium hydroxide used.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SODA ASH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           INSOLUBLE MATTER.\r\n\r\nTreat 5.305 grams of the sample with 200 cc. of freshly boiled and\r\ncooled distilled water. When solution is complete filter through an\r\nasbestos mat in a weighed Gooch crucible, dry, cool, and weigh. Report\r\nthe weight of the residue, in percentage, as insoluble matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           AVAILABLE ALKALI.\r\n\r\nDilute the filtrate from the determination of insoluble matter to 1,000\r\ncc. and thoroughly mix. Titrate 25 cc. of this dilution with N/10\r\nhydrochloric acid in presence of methyl orange indicator. The percentage\r\nof available alkali, expressed as sodium carbonate (Na_{2}CO_{3}), is\r\nequal to 4 times the number of cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHEMICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subjoined bibliography comprises the publications cited in the text\r\nof this report.

The recording of amorphous matter\r\nusually serves no useful purpose and shall not be considered a part of\r\nthe standard method.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus._—1. A cylindrical funnel about two inches in diameter at the\r\ntop, with a straight side for nine inches, narrowed over a distance of\r\nthree inches to a bore of one-half inch in diameter, and terminating in\r\na straight portion of this diameter two and one-half inches in length.\r\nThe capacity of this funnel is 500 cc. It shall be provided at the\r\nbottom with a tightly fitting rubber stopper with a single perforation\r\nand a disk of silk bolting cloth over the hole about three eighths of an\r\ninch in diameter.\r\n\r\n2. A counting cell consisting of a brass rim closely cemented to a plate\r\nof optical glass. The shape and size of this cell are not essential but\r\nits depth shall be one millimeter. A convenient capacity is about one\r\ncubic centimeter.\r\n\r\n3. An ocular micrometer ruled as follows: The ocular micrometer is\r\ncommonly of such a size that with a 16 mm. objective and a suitable tube\r\nlength, the largest square cuts off one square millimeter on the stage.\r\n\r\n_Procedure._—Filter 250 cc. of the water (more or less according to the\r\nclearness of the sample) through a one-half inch layer of quartz sand\r\n(washed and screened between 60 and 120 mesh sieves) supported by the\r\ndisk of bolting cloth and rubber stopper at the bottom of the funnel.\r\nSuction may be applied to hasten the filtration.\r\n\r\nRemove the stopper and catch the plug of sand and its entrained\r\norganisms in a small beaker or test tube, washing down the inside of the\r\nfunnel into the beaker with 5 cc. of clean (preferably distilled) water.\r\nAgitate the mixture of sand, water, and organisms to detach the latter\r\nfrom the sand grains, and quickly decant the water and the organisms in\r\nsuspension to a test tube. If desired the sand may then be again washed\r\nwith 5 cc. water and the wash water added to the first portion.\r\n\r\nCover the cell partially with a cover glass, and by means of a pipette\r\nrun the concentrate under the cover glass until the cell is completely\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\nCover and place on the microscope stage in a horizontal position for\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nCount the organisms in twenty fields, i. e., twenty cubic millimeters,\r\nestimating their areas in terms of Standard Units.\r\n\r\n_The Standard Unit is the smallest square in the ocular micrometer, and\r\nrepresents an area 20µ × 20µ, or 400 square microns on the stage._\r\n\r\nResults shall be expressed in the number of Standard Units of each kind\r\nof micro-organism per cc. and also the total number of standard units of\r\nall kinds per cc. The general directions as to significant figures given\r\nunder Turbidity shall apply also to the microscopical examination.\r\n\r\n_Caution._—Many micro-organisms, especially some of those causing odors,\r\nare so fragile that they are broken up in filtration, especially if the\r\nagitation of the filtrate is too vigorous. A direct examination of a\r\nfresh sample is therefore a useful supplementary procedure. For the same\r\nreason the concentrate should not stand long before examination. Also\r\nsome organisms are carried by specific gravity to the top of the cell\r\nwhich should be scrutinized as well as the bottom layer each time.\r\n\r\nIt is always better to examine the micro-organisms in the field when\r\npossible, and for this purpose the sling filter has been devised\r\nconsisting of a metal funnel slung to a pivoted handle, with a disk of\r\nwire gauze in the detachable lower end to support the sand. Filtration\r\nis hastened by imparting a whirling motion to the whole and utilizing\r\nthe centrifugal force thus generated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OCULAR MICROMETER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MICROSCOPICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n _a._ KEAN, A.

Microscopy of drinking water, 3d ed., John Wiley & Sons, New\r\n        York, 1914. (Contains bibliography.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             I. APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n1. _Sample Bottles._—Any size, shape or quality of bottle may be used\r\nfor a bacterial sample, provided it holds a sufficient amount to carry\r\nout all the tests required and is such that it may be properly washed\r\nand sterilized and will keep the sample uncontaminated until the\r\nanalysis is made. Four- or eight-ounce, ground-glass-stoppered bottles\r\nare recommended. These should be protected by being wrapped in paper, or\r\ntheir necks covered with tin foil, and should be placed in proper boxes\r\nfor transportation.\r\n\r\n2. _Pipettes._—Pipettes may be of any convenient size or shape provided\r\nit is found by actual test that they deliver accurately the required\r\namount in the manner in which they are used. The error of calibration\r\nshall in no case exceed 2 per cent. Protecting the pipettes with a\r\ncotton stopper is recommended.\r\n\r\n3. _Dilution Bottles._—Bottles for use in making dilutions should\r\npreferably be of tall form, of such capacity as to hold at least twice\r\nthe volume of water actually used. Close-fitting ground-glass stoppers\r\nare preferable, but tight fitting cotton stoppers may be used, provided\r\ndue care is taken to prevent contamination and to avoid loss of volume\r\nthrough wetting of the stopper before mixing has been accomplished.\r\n\r\n4. _Petri Dishes._—Petri dishes ten centimeters in diameter shall be\r\nused with glass or porous tops[211] as preferred. The bottoms of the\r\ndishes shall be as flat as possible so that the medium shall be of\r\nuniform thickness throughout the plate.\r\n\r\n5. _Fermentation Tubes._—Any type of fermentation tube[203] may be used\r\nprovided it holds at least three times as much medium as the amount of\r\nwater to be tested.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             II. MATERIALS.\r\n\r\n1. _Water._—Distilled water shall be used in the preparation of all\r\nculture media and reagents.\r\n\r\n2. _Meat Extract._—Liebig’s meat extract shall be used in place of meat\r\ninfusion. Other brands may be substituted for Liebig’s when comparative\r\ntests have shown that they give equivalent results.\r\n\r\n3. _Peptone._—Armour’s, Digestive Ferments Company’s, Fairchild’s, or\r\nany other peptone which gives equivalent results may be used.\r\n\r\n4. _Sugars._—All sugars used shall be of the highest purity obtainable.\r\n\r\n5. _Agar._—The agar used shall be of the best quality and shall be dried\r\nfor one-half hour at 105° C. before weighing. Much of the agar on the\r\nmarket contains considerable amounts of sea salts.[221][225][228] These\r\nmay be removed by soaking in water and draining before use.\r\n\r\n6. _Gelatin._—The gelatin used shall be of light color, shall contain\r\nnot more than a trace of arsenic, copper, sulfides, and shall be free\r\nfrom preservatives, and of such a melting point that a 10 per cent.\r\nstandard nutrient gelatin shall have a melting point of 25° C. or over.\r\nGelatin shall be dried for one-half hour at 105° C. before weighing.\r\n\r\n7. _Litmus._—Reagent litmus of highest purity (not litmus cubes) or\r\nazolitmin (Kahlbaum) shall be used for all media requiring a litmus\r\nindicator.\r\n\r\n8. _General Chemicals._—Special effort shall be made to have all the\r\nother ingredients used for culture media chemically pure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             III. METHODS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    1. PREPARATION OF CULTURE MEDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      a. _Adjustment of Reaction._\r\n\r\n_aa._ _Phenol Red Method for adjustment to a hydrogen-ion concentration\r\nof P_{H+} = 6.8–8.4._ Withdraw 5 cc. of the medium, dilute with 5 cc. of\r\ndistilled water, and add 5 drops of a solution of phenol red (phenol\r\nsulphone phthalein). This solution is made by dissolving 0.04 grams of\r\nphenol red in 30 cc. of alcohol and diluting to 100 cc. with distilled\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nTitrate with a 1:10 dilution of a standard solution of NaOH (which need\r\nnot be of known normality) until the phenol red shows a slight but\r\ndistinct pink color. Calculate the amount of the standard NaOH solution\r\nwhich must be added to the medium to reach this reaction. After the\r\naddition check the reaction by adding 5 drops of phenol red to 5 cc. of\r\nthe medium and 5 cc. of water.\r\n\r\n_bb._ _Titration with phenolphthalein._ (For the convenience of those\r\nwho wish to retain the use of this method for the present it is given\r\nhere, but it is recommended that as soon as possible the more accurate\r\nmethod of determining the hydrogen-ion concentration be substituted.)\r\n\r\nIn a white porcelain dish put 5 cc. of the medium to be tested, add 45\r\ncc. of distilled water. Boil briskly for one minute. Add 1 cc. of\r\nphenolphthalein solution (5 grams of commercial salt to one liter of 50\r\nper cent. alcohol). Titrate immediately with a n/20 solution of sodium\r\nhydrate. A faint but distinct pink color marks the true end-point. This\r\ncolor may be precisely described as a combination of 25 per cent. of red\r\n(wave length approximately 658) with 75 per cent. of white as shown by\r\nthe disks of the standard color top made by the Milton Bradley\r\nEducational Co., Springfield, Mass.\r\n\r\nAll reactions shall be expressed with reference to the phenolphthalein\r\nneutral point and shall be stated in percentages of normal acid or\r\nalkali solutions required to neutralize them. Alkaline media shall be\r\nrecorded with a minus (-) sign before the percentage of normal acid\r\nneeded for their neutralization and acid media with a plus (+) sign\r\nbefore the percentage of normal alkali solution needed for their\r\nneutralization.\r\n\r\nThe standard reaction for culture media for water analysis shall be +1.0\r\nper cent., as determined by tests of the sterilized medium. As\r\nordinarily prepared, broth and agar will be found to have a reaction\r\nbetween +0.5 and +1.0. For such media no adjustment shall be made. The\r\nreaction of media containing sugar shall be neutral to phenolphthalein.\r\nWhenever reactions other than the standard are used, it shall be so\r\nstated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          b. _Sterilization._\r\n\r\nAll media and dilution water shall be sterilized in the autoclav at 15\r\nlbs. (120° C.) for 15 minutes after the pressure reaches 15 lbs. All air\r\nmust be forced out of the autoclav before the pressure is allowed to\r\nrise. As soon as possible after sterilization the media shall be removed\r\nfrom the autoclav and cooled rapidly. Rapid and immediate cooling of\r\ngelatin is imperative.\r\n\r\nMedia shall be sterilized in small containers, and these must not be\r\nclosely packed together. No part of the medium shall be more than 2.5\r\ncm. from the outside surface of the glass. All glassware shall be\r\nsterilized in the dry oven at 170° C. for at least 1½ hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n                c. _Nutrient Broth. To Make One Liter._\r\n\r\n1. Add 3 grams of beef extract and 5 grams of peptone to 1,000 cc. of\r\ndistilled water.\r\n\r\n2. Heat slowly on a steam bath to at least 65° C.\r\n\r\n3. Make up lost weight and adjust the reaction to a faint pink with\r\nphenol red, or if the phenolphthalein titration is used, and the\r\nreaction is not already between +0.5 and +1, adjust to +1.\r\n\r\n4. Cool to 25° C. and filter through filter paper until clear.\r\n\r\n5. Distribute in test-tubes, 10 cc. to each tube.\r\n\r\n6. Sterilize in the autoclav at 15 lbs. (120° C.) for 15 minutes after\r\nthe pressure reaches 15 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           d. _Sugar Broths._\r\n\r\nSugar broths shall be prepared in the same general manner as nutrient\r\nbroth with the addition of 0.5 per cent. of the required carbohydrate\r\njust before sterilization. The removal of muscle sugar is unnecessary as\r\nthe beef extract and peptone are free from any fermentable\r\ncarbohydrates. The reaction of sugar broths shall be a faint pink with\r\nphenol red or, if on titration with phenolphthalein the reaction is not\r\nalready between neutral and +1, adjust to neutral. Sterilization shall\r\nbe in the autoclav at 15 lbs. (120° C.) for 15 minutes after the\r\npressure reaches 15 lbs., provided the total time of exposure to heat is\r\nnot more than one-half hour; otherwise a 10 per cent. solution of the\r\nrequired carbohydrate shall be made in distilled water and sterilized at\r\n100° C. for 1½ hours, and this solution shall be added to sterile\r\nnutrient broth in amounts sufficient to make a 0.5 per cent. solution of\r\nthe carbohydrate and the mixture shall then be tubed and sterilized at\r\n100° C. for 30 minutes, or it is permissible to add by means of a\r\nsterile pipette directly to a tube of sterile neutral broth enough of\r\nthe carbohydrate to make the required 0.5 per cent. The tubes so made\r\nshall be incubated at 37° C. for 24 hours as a test for sterility.\r\n\r\n\r\n               e. _Nutrient Gelatin. To Make One Liter._\r\n\r\n1. Add 3 grams of beef extract and 5 grams of peptone to 1,000 cc. of\r\ndistilled water and add 100 grams of gelatin dried for one-half hour at\r\n105° C. before weighing.\r\n\r\n2. Heat slowly on a steam bath to 65° C. until all gelatin is\r\ndissolved.[G]\r\n\r\nFootnote G:\r\n\r\n  The solution of the gelatin will be facilitated by allowing it to soak\r\n  in the cold one-half hour before heating.\r\n\r\n3. Make up lost weight and adjust the reaction to a faint pink with\r\nphenol red, or if the phenolphthalein titration is used, and the\r\nreaction is not already between +0.5 and +1, adjust to +1.\r\n\r\n4. Filter through cloth and cotton until clear.\r\n\r\n5. Distribute in test-tubes, 10 cc. to each tube, or in larger\r\ncontainers as desired.\r\n\r\n6. Sterilize in the autoclav at 15 lbs. (120° C.) for 15 minutes after\r\nthe pressure reaches 15 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 f. _Nutrient Agar. To Make One Liter._\r\n\r\n1. Add 3 grams of beef extract, 5 grams of peptone and 12 grams of agar,\r\ndried for one-half hour at 105° C. before weighing, to 1,000 cc. of\r\ndistilled water. Boil over a water bath until all agar is dissolved, and\r\nthen make up the loss by evaporation.\r\n\r\n2. Cool to 45° C. in a cold water bath, then warm to 65° C. in the same\r\nbath, without stirring.\r\n\r\n3. Make up lost weight and adjust the reaction to a faint pink with\r\nphenol red, or if the phenolphthalein titration is used, and the\r\nreaction is not already between +0.5 and +1, adjust to +1.\r\n\r\n4. Filter through cloth and cotton until clear.\r\n\r\n5. Distribute in test-tubes, 10 cc. to each tube, or in larger\r\ncontainers, as desired.\r\n\r\n6. Sterilize in the autoclav at 15 lbs. (120° C.) for 15 minutes after\r\nthe pressure reaches 15 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   g. _Litmus or Azolitmin Solution._\r\n\r\nThe standard litmus solution shall be a 2 per cent. aqueous solution of\r\nreagent litmus. Powder the litmus, add to the water and boil for five\r\nminutes. The solution usually needs no correction in reaction and may be\r\nat once distributed in flasks or test-tubes and sterilized as is culture\r\nmedia. It should give a distinctly blue plate when 1 cc. is added to 10\r\ncc. of neutral culture medium in a Petri dish.\r\n\r\nThe standard azolitmin solution shall be a 1 per cent. solution of\r\nKahlbaum’s azolitmin. Add the azolitmin powder to the water and boil for\r\nfive minutes. The solution may need to be corrected in reaction by the\r\naddition of sodium hydrate solution so that it will be approximately\r\nneutral and will give a distinctly blue plate when 1 cc. is added to 10\r\ncc. of neutral culture medium in a Petri dish. It may be distributed in\r\nflasks or test-tubes and sterilized as is culture media.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       h. _Litmus-lactose-agar._\r\n\r\nLitmus-lactose-agar shall be prepared in the same manner as nutrient\r\nagar with the addition of 1 per cent. of lactose just before\r\nsterilization. The reaction shall be a faint pink with phenol red, or,\r\nif on titration with phenolphthalein the reaction is not already between\r\nneutral and +1, adjust to neutral. One cc. of sterilized litmus or\r\nazolitmin solution shall be added to each 10 cc. of the medium just\r\nbefore it is poured into the Petri dish, or the mixture may be made in\r\nthe dish itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n        i. _Endo’s Medium._[209][214][215] _To Make One Liter._\r\n\r\n1. Add 5 grams of beef extract, 10 grams of peptone and 30 grams of agar\r\ndried for one-half hour at 105° C. before weighing, to 1,000 cc. of\r\ndistilled water. Boil on a water bath until all the agar is dissolved\r\nand then make up the loss by evaporation.\r\n\r\n2. Cool the mixture to 45° C. in a cold water bath, then warm to 65° C.\r\nin the same bath without stirring.\r\n\r\n3. Make up lost weight, titrate, and if the reaction is not already\r\nbetween neutral and +1 adjust to neutral.\r\n\r\n4. Filter through cloth and cotton until clear.\r\n\r\n5. Distribute 100 cc. or larger known quantities in flasks large enough\r\nto hold the other ingredients which are to be added later.\r\n\r\n6. Sterilize in the autoclav at 15 lbs. (120° C.) for 15 minutes after\r\nthe pressure reaches 15 lbs.\r\n\r\n7. Prepare a 10 per cent. solution of basic fuchsin in 95 per cent.\r\nalcohol, allow to stand 20 hours, decant and filter the supernatant\r\nfluid. This is a stock solution.\r\n\r\n8. When ready to make plates melt 100 cc. of agar in streaming steam or\r\non a water bath. Dissolve 1 gram of lactose in 15 cc. of distilled\r\nwater, using heat if necessary. Dissolve 0.25 gram anhydrous sodium\r\nsulphite in 10 cc. water. To the sulphite solution add 0.5 cc. of the\r\nfuchsin stock solution. Add the fuchsin-sulphite solution to the lactose\r\nsolution and then add the resulting solution to the melted agar. The\r\nlactose used must be chemically pure and the sulphite solution must be\r\nmade up fresh.\r\n\r\n9. Pour plates and allow to harden thoroughly in the incubator before\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        2. COLLECTION OF SAMPLE.\r\n\r\nSamples for bacterial analysis shall be collected in bottles which have\r\nbeen cleansed with great care, rinsed in clean water, and sterilized\r\nwith dry heat for at least one hour and a half at 170° C., or in the\r\nautoclav at 15 lbs. (120° C.) for 15 minutes or longer after the\r\npressure reaches 15 lbs.\r\n\r\nGreat care must be exercised to have the samples representative of the\r\nwater to be tested and to see that no contamination occurs at the time\r\nof filling the sample bottles.\r\n\r\n\r\n               3. STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION OF SAMPLES.\r\n\r\nBecause of the rapid and often extensive changes which may take place in\r\nthe bacterial flora of bottled samples when stored even at temperatures\r\nas low as 10° C., it is urged, as of importance, that all samples be\r\nexamined as promptly as possible after collection.\r\n\r\nThe time allowed for storage or transportation of a bacterial sample\r\nbetween the filling of the sample bottle and the beginning of the\r\nanalysis should be not more than six hours for impure waters and not\r\nmore than twelve hours for relatively pure waters. During the period of\r\nstorage, the temperature shall be kept as near 10° C. as possible. Any\r\ndeviation from the above limits shall be so stated in making reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             4. DILUTIONS.\r\n\r\nDilution bottles shall be filled with the proper amount of tap water so\r\nthat after sterilization they shall contain exactly 9 cc. or 99 cc. as\r\ndesired. The exact amount of water can only be determined by experiment\r\nwith the particular autoclav in use. If desired, the 9 cc. dilution may\r\nbe measured out from a flask of sterile water with a sterile pipette.\r\n\r\nDilution bottles shall be sterilized in the autoclav at 15 lbs. (120°\r\nC.) for 15 minutes after the pressure reaches 15 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe sample bottle shall be shaken vigorously 25 times and 1 cc.\r\nwithdrawn and added to the proper dilution bottles as required. Each\r\ndilution bottle after the addition of the 1 cc. of the sample, shall be\r\nshaken vigorously 25 times before a second dilution is made from it or\r\nbefore a sample is removed for plating.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              5. PLATING.\r\n\r\nAll sample and dilution bottles shall be shaken vigorously 25 times\r\nbefore samples are removed for plating. Plating shall be done\r\nimmediately after the dilutions are made. One cc. of the sample or\r\ndilution shall be used for plating and shall be placed in the Petri\r\ndish, first. Ten cc. of liquefied medium at a temperature of 40° C.\r\nshall be added to the 1 cc. of water in the Petri dish. The cover of the\r\nPetri dish shall be lifted just enough for the introduction of the\r\npipette or culture medium, and the lips of all test-tubes or flasks used\r\nfor pouring the medium shall be flamed. In making litmus-lactose-agar\r\nplates, 1 cc. of sterile litmus or azolitmin solution shall be added to\r\neach 10 cc. of culture medium either in the Petri dish or before pouring\r\ninto the Petri dish. The medium and sample in the Petri dish shall be\r\nthoroughly mixed and uniformly spread over the bottom of the Petri dish\r\nby tilting or rotating the dish. All plates shall be solidified as\r\nrapidly as possible after pouring and gelatin plates shall be placed\r\nimmediately in the 20° C. incubator and the agar plates in the 37° C.\r\nincubator. Endo plates shall be made by placing one loopful of the\r\nmaterial to be tested on the surface of the plate and distributing the\r\nmaterial with a sterile loop or glass rod.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             6. INCUBATION.\r\n\r\nAll gelatin plates shall be incubated for 48 hours at 20 C. in a dark,\r\nwell-ventilated incubator in an atmosphere practically saturated with\r\nmoisture.[227]\r\n\r\nAll agar plates shall be incubated for 24 hours at 37° C. in a dark,\r\nwell-ventilated incubator in an atmosphere practically saturated with\r\nmoisture. Glass covered plates shall be inverted in the incubator. Any\r\ndeviation from the above described method shall be stated in making\r\nreports.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              7. COUNTING.\r\n\r\nIn preparing plates, such amounts of the water under examination shall\r\nbe planted as will give from 25 to 250 colonies on a plate;[202] and the\r\naim should be always to have at least two plates giving colonies between\r\nthese limits. Where it is possible to obtain plates showing colonies\r\nwithin these limits, only such plates should be considered in recording\r\nresults, except where the same amount of water has been planted in two\r\nor more plates, of which one gives colonies within these limits, while\r\nthe others give less than 25 or more than 250. In such case, the result\r\nrecorded should be the average of all the plates planted with this\r\namount of water. Ordinarily it is not desirable to plant more than 1 cc.\r\nof water in a plate; therefore, when the total number of colonies\r\ndeveloping from 1 cc. is less than 25, it is obviously necessary to\r\nrecord the results as observed, disregarding the general rule given\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nCounting shall in all cases be done with a lens of 2½ diameter’s\r\nmagnification, 3½X. The Engraver’s Lens No. 146 made by the Bausch &\r\nLomb Optical Company fills the requirements, and is a convenient lens\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n     8. THE TEST FOR THE PRESENCE OF MEMBERS OF THE B. COLI GROUP.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that the B. coli group be considered as including all\r\nnon-spore-forming bacilli which ferment lactose with gas formation and\r\ngrow aërobically on standard solid media.\r\n\r\nThe formation of 10 per cent. or more of gas in a standard lactose broth\r\nfermentation tube within 24 hours at 37° C. is presumptive evidence of\r\nthe presence of members of the B. coli group, since the majority of the\r\nbacteria which give such a reaction belong to this group.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of aërobic lactose-splitting colonies on\r\nlactose-litmus-agar or Endo’s medium plates made from a lactose broth\r\nfermentation tube in which gas has formed confirms to a considerable\r\nextent the presumption that gas-formation in the fermentation tube was\r\ndue to the presence of members of the B. coli group.\r\n\r\nTo complete the demonstration of the presence of B. coli as above\r\ndefined, it is necessary to show that one or more of these aërobic plate\r\ncolonies consists of non-spore-forming bacilli which, when inoculated\r\ninto a lactose broth fermentation tube, form gas.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that the standard tests for the B. coli group be\r\neither (A) the _Presumptive_, (B) the _Partially Confirmed_, or (C) the\r\n_Completed_ test as hereafter defined, each test being applicable under\r\nthe circumstances specified.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A. PRESUMPTIVE TEST.\r\n\r\n1. Inoculate a series of fermentation tubes with appropriate graduated\r\nquantities of the water to be tested. In every fermentation tube there\r\nmust always be at least three times as much medium as the amount of\r\nwater to be tested. When necessary to examine larger amounts than 10 cc.\r\nas many tubes as necessary shall be inoculated with 10 cc. each.\r\n\r\n2. Incubate these tubes at 37° C. for 48 hours. Examine each tube at 24\r\nand 48 hours, and record gas-formation. The records should be such as to\r\ndistinguish between:\r\n\r\n(a) Absence of gas-formation.\r\n\r\n(b) Formation of gas occupying less than ten per cent. (10%) of the\r\nclosed arm.\r\n\r\n(c) Formation of gas occupying more than ten per cent. (10%) of the\r\nclosed arm.\r\n\r\nMore detailed records of the amount of gas formed, though desirable for\r\npurposes of study, are not necessary for carrying out the standard tests\r\nprescribed.\r\n\r\n3. The formation within 24 hours of gas occupying more than ten per\r\ncent. (10%) of the closed arm of fermentation tube constitutes _a\r\npositive presumptive test_.\r\n\r\n4. If no gas is formed in 24 hours, or if the gas formed is less than\r\nten per cent. (10%), the incubation shall be continued to 48 hours. The\r\npresence of gas in any amount in such a tube at 48 hours constitutes _a\r\ndoubtful test_, which in all cases requires confirmation.\r\n\r\n5. The absence of gas formation after 48 hours’ incubation constitutes\r\n_a negative test_. (An arbitrary limit of 48 hours’ observation\r\ndoubtless excludes from consideration occasional members of the B. coli\r\ngroup which form gas very slowly, but for the purposes of a standard\r\ntest the exclusion of these occasional slow gas-forming organisms is\r\nconsidered immaterial.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                      B. PARTIALLY CONFIRMED TEST.\r\n\r\n1. Make one or more Endo’s medium or lactose-litmus-agar plates from the\r\ntube which, after 48 hours’ incubation, shows gas formation from the\r\nsmallest amount of water tested. (For example, if the water has been\r\ntested in amounts of 10 cc., 1 cc., and 0.1 cc., and gas is formed in 10\r\ncc., and 1 cc., not in 0.1 cc., the test need be confirmed only in the 1\r\ncc. amount.)\r\n\r\n2. Incubate the plates at 37° C., 18 to 24 hours.\r\n\r\n3. If typical colon-like red colonies have developed upon the plate\r\nwithin this period, the confirmed test may be considered positive.\r\n\r\n4. If, however, no typical colonies have developed within 24 hours, the\r\ntest cannot yet be considered definitely negative, since it not\r\ninfrequently happens that members of the B. coli group fail to form\r\ntypical colonies on Endo’s medium or lactose-litmus-agar plates, or that\r\nthe colonies develop slowly. In such case, it is always necessary to\r\ncomplete the test as directed under “C” 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           C. COMPLETED TEST.\r\n\r\n1. From the Endo’s medium or lactose-litmus-agar plate made as\r\nprescribed under “B,” fish at least two typical colonies, transferring\r\neach to an agar slant and a lactose broth fermentation tube.\r\n\r\n2. If no typical colonies appear upon the plate within 24 hours, the\r\nplate should be reincubated another 24 hours, after which at least two\r\nof the colonies considered to be most likely B. coli, whether typical or\r\nnot, shall be transferred to agar slants and lactose broth fermentation\r\ntubes.\r\n\r\n3. The lactose broth fermentation tubes thus inoculated shall be\r\nincubated until gas formation is noted; the incubation not to exceed 48\r\nhours. The agar slants shall be incubated at 37° C. for 48 hours, when a\r\nmicroscopic examination shall be made of at least one culture, selecting\r\none which corresponds to one of the lactose broth fermentation tubes\r\nwhich has shown gas-formation.\r\n\r\nThe formation of gas in lactose broth and the demonstration of\r\nnon-spore-forming bacilli in the agar culture shall be considered a\r\nsatisfactory completed test, demonstrating the presence of a member of\r\nthe B. coli group.\r\n\r\nThe absence of gas-formation in lactose broth or failure to demonstrate\r\nnon-spore-forming bacilli in a gas-forming culture constitutes a\r\nnegative test.\r\n\r\n\r\n APPLICATION OF PRESUMPTIVE, PARTIALLY CONFIRMED, AND COMPLETED TESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        A. The Presumptive Test.\r\n\r\n  1. When definitely positive, that is showing more than 10 per cent.\r\n    (10%) of gas in 24 hours, is sufficient:\r\n\r\n      (a) As applied to all except the smallest gas-forming portion of\r\n        each sample in all examinations.\r\n\r\n      (b) As applied to the smallest gas-forming portion in the\r\n        examination of sewage or of water showing relatively high\r\n        pollution, such that its fitness for use as drinking water does\r\n        not come into consideration. This applies to the routine\r\n        examinations of raw water in connection with control of the\r\n        operation of purification plants.\r\n\r\n  2. When definitely negative, that is showing no gas in 48 hours, is\r\n    final and therefore sufficient in all cases.\r\n\r\n  3. When doubtful, that is showing gas less than 10 per cent. (10%) (or\r\n    none) in 24 hours, with gas either more or less than 10 per cent. in\r\n    48 hours, must always be confirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    B. The Partially Confirmed Test.\r\n\r\n  1. When definitely positive, that is, showing typical plate colonies\r\n    within 24 hours, is sufficient:\r\n\r\n      (a) When applied to confirm a doubtful presumptive test in cases\r\n        where the latter, if definitely positive, would have been\r\n        sufficient.\r\n\r\n      (b) In the routine examination of water supplies where a\r\n        sufficient number of prior examinations have established a\r\n        satisfactory index of the accuracy and significance of this test\r\n        in terms of the completed test.\r\n\r\n  2. When doubtful, that is, showing colonies of doubtful or negative\r\n    appearance in 24 hours, must always be completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         C. The Completed Test.\r\n\r\n  The completed test is required as applied to the smallest gas-forming\r\n    portion of each sample in all cases other than those noted as\r\n    exceptions under the “presumptive” and the “partially confirmed”\r\n    tests.\r\n\r\n  The completed test is required in _all_ cases where the result of the\r\n    confirmed test has been doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       9. EXPRESSION OF RESULTS.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid fictitious accuracy and yet to express the numerical\r\nresults by a method consistent with the precision of the work, the\r\nnumbers of colonies of bacteria per cubic centimeter shall be recorded\r\nas follows:[212]\r\n\r\n                       Number of bacteria per cc.\r\n From         1 to         50    shall be recorded as found\r\n  \"          51 \"         100    \"    \"   \"      to the nearest       5\r\n  \"         101 \"         250    \"    \"   \"      \"   \"    \"          10\r\n  \"         251 \"         500    \"    \"   \"      \"   \"    \"          25\r\n  \"         501 \"       1,000    \"    \"   \"      \"   \"    \"          50\r\n  \"       1,001 \"      10,000    \"    \"   \"      \"   \"    \"         100\r\n  \"      10,001 \"      50,000    \"    \"   \"      \"   \"    \"         500\r\n  \"      50,001 \"     100,000    \"    \"   \"      \"   \"    \"       1,000\r\n  \"     100,001 \"     500,000    \"    \"   \"      \"   \"    \"      10,000\r\n  \"     500,001 \"   1,000,000    \"    \"   \"      \"   \"    \"      50,000\r\n  \"   1,000,001 \"  10,000,000    \"    \"   \"      \"   \"    \"     100,000\r\n\r\nThis applies to the gelatin count at 20° C. and to the agar count at 37°\r\nC.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF STEPS INVOLVED IN MAKING PRESUMPTIVE, PARTIALLY CONFIRMED AND\r\n                      COMPLETED TESTS FOR B.

To\r\ninsure this result, it is often necessary to plant four or five\r\ndilutions, especially in the examination of a sample of entirely unknown\r\nquality. The quantitative value of a series of tests is lost, unless all\r\nor at least a large proportion of the smallest dilutions tested have\r\ngiven negative results.\r\n\r\nIn reporting a single test, it is preferable merely to record results as\r\nobserved, indicating the amounts tested and the result in each, rather\r\nthan to attempt expression of the result in numbers of B. coli per cc.\r\nIn summarizing the results of a series of tests, however, it is\r\ndesirable, for the sake of simplicity, to express the results in terms\r\nof the numbers of B. coli per cc., or per 100 cc. To convert results of\r\nfermentation tests to this form, the result of each test is recorded as\r\nindicating a number of B. coli per cc. equal to the reciprocal of the\r\nsmallest decimal or multiple fraction of a cubic centimeter giving a\r\npositive result. For example, the result: 10 cc. +; 1 cc. +; 0.1 cc. -;\r\nwould be recorded as indicating one B. coli per cc. An exception should\r\nbe made in the case where a negative result is obtained in an amount\r\nlarger than the smallest portion giving a positive result; for example,\r\nin a result such as: 10 cc. +; 1 cc. -; 0.1 cc. +. In such case, the\r\nresult should be recorded as indicating a number of B. coli per cc.\r\nequal to the reciprocal of the dilution next larger than the smallest\r\none giving a positive test, this being a more probable result.\r\n\r\nWhere tests are made in amounts larger than 1 cc., giving average\r\nresults less than one B. coli per cc., it is more convenient to express\r\nresults in terms of the numbers of B. coli per 100 cc.\r\n\r\nThe following table illustrates the method of recording and averaging\r\nresults of B. coli tests:\r\n\r\n     Result of Tests in Amounts Designated.      Indicated Number of B.\r\n                                                          coli.\r\n   10 cc.       1 cc.      0.1 cc.     .01 cc.     per cc.   per 100 cc.\r\n      +           −           −           −              0.1         10.\r\n      +           +           −           −              1.0        100.\r\n      +           +           +           −             10.0      1,000.\r\n      +           +           +           +            100.0     10,000.\r\n      +           +           −           +             10.0      1,000.\r\n                                                       —————       —————\r\n Totals (for estimating averages)                      121.1     12,110.\r\n Average of 5 tests                                     24.0      2,422.\r\n\r\nThe above method of expressing results is not mathematically altogether\r\ncorrect. The average number of B. coli per cc., as thus estimated, is\r\nnot precisely the most probable number calculated by application of the\r\ntheory of probability.[220] To apply this theory to a correct\r\nmathematical solution of any considerable series of results involves,\r\nhowever, mathematical calculations so complex as to be impracticable of\r\napplication in general practice. The simpler method given is therefore\r\nconsidered preferable, since it is easily applied and the results so\r\nexpressed are readily comprehensible.\r\n\r\nIn order that results as reported may be checked and carefully valuated,\r\nit is necessary that the report should show not only the average number\r\nof B. coli per cc., but also the number of samples examined; and, for\r\neach dilution, the total number of tests made, and the number (or per\r\ncent.) positive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     10. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS.\r\n\r\nWhile it is not within the province of this report to suggest the proper\r\ninterpretation of results obtained by the use of the methods herein\r\nspecified as standard, the committee feels that a word of caution should\r\nbe given regarding the significance of the presence in a water of\r\nmembers of the B. coli group as defined in this report. Recent work\r\nseems to indicate that the B. coli group as herein defined consists of\r\norganisms of both fecal and non-fecal origin. Therefore care must be\r\nexercised in judging the sanitary quality of a water solely from the\r\ndetermination of the presence of members of the group.\r\n\r\n\r\n   11. DIFFERENTIATION OF FECAL FROM NON-FECAL MEMBERS OF THE B. COLI\r\n                                 GROUP.\r\n\r\n(1) At least 10 cultures should be used. If possible these should be\r\nsubcultured from plates made direct from the water since all of the\r\ncultures obtained by plating from fermentation tubes may be descendants\r\nof a single cell in the water. If cultures from water plates are not\r\navailable those obtained from plates made as prescribed under B (p. 101)\r\nmay be used.\r\n\r\n(2) Inoculate each culture into dextrose potassium phosphate broth,[H]\r\nadonite broth, and gelatin. For additional confirmatory evidence\r\ninoculation may be made into tryptophane broth,[I] and saccharose broth.\r\nThe dextrose broth must be incubated at 30°. Other sugar broths may be\r\nincubated at 30° or 37° as convenient. Gelatin should be incubated at\r\n20°.\r\n\r\nFootnote H:\r\n\r\n  (a) _Peptone Medium for the Methyl Red Test. To Make One Liter._\r\n\r\n  1. To 800 cc. of distilled water add 5 grams of Proteose-Peptone,\r\n  Difco., or Witte’s Peptone (other peptones should not be substituted),\r\n  5 grams c. p. dextrose, and 5 grams dipotassium hydrogen phosphate\r\n  (K_{2}HPO_{4}). A dilute solution of the K_{2}HPO_{4} should give a\r\n  distinct pink with phenolphthalein.\r\n\r\n  2. Heat with occasional stirring over steam for twenty minutes.\r\n\r\n  3. Filter through folded filter paper, cool to 20° C. and dilute to\r\n  1,000 cc. with distilled water.\r\n\r\n  4. Distribute 10 cc. portions in sterilized test-tubes.\r\n\r\n  5. Sterilize by the intermittent method for 20 minutes on three\r\n  successive days.\r\n\r\nFootnote I:\r\n\r\n  _Tryptophane Broth for Indol Test._\r\n\r\n  To 1,000 cc. of distilled water add 0.3 gram tryptophane, 5 grams\r\n  dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (K_{2}HPO_{4}), and 1 gram peptone.\r\n  Heat until ingredients are thoroughly dissolved, tube (6 to 8 cc.),\r\n  and sterilize in autoclave for 15 minutes after the pressure reaches\r\n  15 pounds. Some American peptones are standardized to contain a\r\n  uniform amount of tryptophane. If such peptone is used the tryptophane\r\n  in the above formula may be omitted and the peptone increased to 5\r\n  grams.\r\n\r\n(3) After 48 hours record gas formation in adonite and saccharose\r\nbroths. Determine indol formation in tryptophane broth by adding drop by\r\ndrop, to avoid mixing with the medium, about 1 cc. of a 2 per cent.\r\nalcoholic solution of p-dimethyl amido-benzaldehyd, then a few drops of\r\nconcentrated hydrochloric acid. The presence of indol is indicated by a\r\nred color which is soluble in chloroform. There may be some unconverted\r\ntryptophane still present which will give a distinctly blue color which\r\nis insoluble in chloroform. A mixture of the two will be either blue or\r\nviolet. If from such a mixture of colors the red of indol be extracted\r\nwith chloroform proof of the presence of indol will be complete.\r\n\r\n(4) After 5 days apply methyl red test and Voges-Proskauer test to\r\ndextrose broth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Methyl Red Test._[J]\r\n\r\nIndicator solution.—Dissolve 0.1 gram methyl red in 300 cc. alcohol and\r\ndilute to 500 cc. with distilled water.\r\n\r\nFootnote J:\r\n\r\n  (b) _Synthetic Medium for the Methyl Red Test._ To Make One Liter.\r\n  Dissolve 7 grams Na_{2}HPO_{4} (anhydrous) or 8.8 grams\r\n  Na_{2}HPO_{4}.2H_{2}O, 2 grams KHphthalate, 1 gram aspartic acid, and\r\n  4 grams dextrose in about 800 cc. of warm distilled water. When\r\n  solution is complete, cool and make up to 1 liter at room temperature.\r\n  Heat in an autoclave for 15 minutes after the pressure has reached 15\r\n  pounds, provided the total time of exposure to heat is not more than\r\n  one-half hour. The hydrogen-ion concentration of the medium is fixed\r\n  by the composition. It should be very close to P_{H} 7.0, slightly red\r\n  with phenol red. All materials should be recrystallized or if used\r\n  from stock furnished by manufacturers, should be carefully examined.\r\n  The di-sodium hydrogen phosphate may be used either as the anhydrous\r\n  salt obtained by dessication in vacuo at 100° C. or else as the salt\r\n  containing two molecules of water of crystallization. This is obtained\r\n  by exposing the recrystallized Na_{2}HPO_{4}.12H_{2}O for two weeks.\r\n  Use 0.88 per cent. of Na_{2}HPO_{4}.2H_{2}O.\r\n\r\nProcedure in test.—1. To 5 cc. of each culture add 5 drops of methyl red\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n2. Record distinct red color as methyl red +, distinct yellow color as\r\nmethyl red -, and intermediate colors as ?.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Voges-Proskauer Test._[216]\r\n\r\nTo the remaining 5 cc. of medium add 5 cc. of a 10 per cent. solution of\r\npotassium hydroxide. Allow to stand over night. A positive test is\r\nindicated by an eosin pink color.\r\n\r\n(5) Gelatin tubes should not be pronounced negative until they have been\r\nincubated at least 15 days.\r\n\r\nThe following group reactions indicate the source of the culture with a\r\nhigh degree of probability:\r\n\r\n    Methyl red +         │B. coli of fecal origin.\r\n    Voges-Proskauer −    │\r\n    Gelatin −            │\r\n    Adonite −            │\r\n    Indol, usually +     │\r\n    Saccharose, usually −│\r\n\r\n    Methyl red −         │B. aërogenes of fecal origin.\r\n    Voges-Proskauer +    │\r\n    Gelatin −            │\r\n    Adonite +            │\r\n    Indol, usually −     │\r\n    Saccharose +         │\r\n\r\n    Methyl red −         │B. aërogenes, probably not of fecal\r\n                         │  origin.\r\n    Voges-Proskauer +    │\r\n    Gelatin −            │\r\n    Adonite −            │\r\n    Indol, usually −     │\r\n    Saccharose +         │\r\n\r\n    Methyl red −         │B. cloacae, may or may not be of fecal\r\n                         │  origin.\r\n    Voges-Proskauer +    │\r\n    Gelatin +            │\r\n    Adonite +            │\r\n    Indol, usually −     │\r\n    Saccharose +         │\r\n\r\n\r\n       12. ROUTINE PROCEDURE FOR EXAMINATION OF SAMPLES OF WATER.\r\n\r\n_First Day_:\r\n\r\n    1. Prepare dilutions as required.\r\n\r\n    2. Make two (2) gelatin plates from each dilution, and incubate at\r\n      20° C.\r\n\r\n    3. Make two (2) agar plates from each dilution, and incubate at 37°\r\n      C.\r\n\r\n    4. Inoculate lactose broth fermentation tubes with appropriate\r\n      amounts for B. coli tests, inoculating two (2) tubes with each\r\n      amount.\r\n\r\nNote:—Where repeated tests are made of water from the same source, as is\r\ncustomary in the control of public supplies, it is not necessary to make\r\nduplicate plates or fermentation tubes in each dilution. It is\r\nsufficient, in such circumstances, to make duplicate plates only from\r\nthe dilution which will most probably give from 25 to 250 colonies per\r\nplate.\r\n\r\n_Second Day_:\r\n\r\n    1. Count the agar plates made on the first day.\r\n\r\n    2. Record the number of lactose broth fermentation tubes which show\r\n      10 per cent. (10%) or more of gas.\r\n\r\nNote:—In case only the presumptive test for B. coli is required,\r\nfermentation tubes showing more than 10 per cent. (10%) of gas at this\r\ntime may be discarded.\r\n\r\n_Third Day_:\r\n\r\n    1. Count gelatin plates made on first day.\r\n\r\n    2. Record the number of additional fermentation tubes which show 10\r\n      per cent. (10%) or more of gas.\r\n\r\n    3. Make a lactose-litmus-agar or Endo’s medium plate from the\r\n      smallest portion of each sample showing gas. Incubate plate at 37°\r\n      C.\r\n\r\nNote:—In case the smallest portion in which gas has been formed shows\r\nless than 10 per cent. (10%) of gas, it is well to make a plate also\r\nfrom the next larger portion, so that, in case the smallest portion\r\ngives a negative end result it may still be possible to demonstrate B.\r\ncoli in the next larger dilution.\r\n\r\n_Fourth Day_:\r\n\r\n    1. Examine Endo’s medium or lactose-litmus-agar plates. If typical\r\n      colonies have developed, select two and transfer each to a lactose\r\n      broth fermentation tube and an agar slant, both of which are to be\r\n      incubated at 37° C.\r\n\r\n    2. If no typical B. coli colonies are found, incubate the plates\r\n      another 24 hours.\r\n\r\n_Fifth Day_:\r\n\r\n    1. Select at least two colonies, whether typical or not, from the\r\n      Endo’s medium or lactose-litmus-agar plates which have been\r\n      incubated an additional 24 hours; transfer each to a lactose broth\r\n      fermentation tube and an agar slant, and complete the test as for\r\n      typical colonies.\r\n\r\n    2. Examine lactose broth fermentation tubes inoculated from plates\r\n      on the previous day. Tubes in which gas has been formed may be\r\n      discarded after the result has been recorded. Those in which no\r\n      gas has formed should be incubated an additional 24 hours.\r\n\r\n_Sixth Day_:\r\n\r\n    1. Examine lactose broth fermentation tubes reincubated the previous\r\n      day.\r\n\r\n    2. Examine microscopically agar slants corresponding to lactose\r\n      fermentation tubes inoculated from plate colonies and showing\r\n      gas-formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     BACTERIOLOGICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nBibliography 201:\r\n\r\n  BOVIE, W.
