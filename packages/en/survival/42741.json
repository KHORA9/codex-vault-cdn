W. DAWSON, LL.D., F.K.S., F.G.S.,\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL AND VICE-CHANCELLOR OF McGILL UNIVERSITY, MONTREAL, AUTHOR\r\nOF \"ARCHAIA,\" \"ACADIAN GEOLOGY,\" ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NEW YORK:\r\n    HARPER & BROTHERS, PUBLISHERS,\r\n    FRANKLIN SQUARE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe science of the earth as illustrated by geological research, is one\r\nof the noblest outgrowths of our modern intellectual life.\r\nConstituting the sum of all the natural sciences in their application\r\nto the history of our world, it affords a very wide and varied scope\r\nfor mental activity, and deals with some of the grandest problems of\r\nspace and time and of organic existence. It invites us to be present\r\nat the origin of things, and to enter into the very workshop of the\r\nCreator. It has, besides, most important and intimate connection with\r\nthe industrial arts and with the material resources at the disposal of\r\nman. Its educational value, as a means of cultivating the powers of\r\nobserving and reasoning, and of accustoming the mind to deal with\r\nlarge and intricate questions, can scarcely be overrated.\r\n\r\nBut fully to serve these high ends, the study of geology must be based\r\non a thorough knowledge of the subjects which constitute its\r\nelementary data. It must be divested as far as possible of merely\r\nlocal colouring, and of the prejudices of specialists. It must be\r\nemancipated from the control of the bald metaphysical speculations so\r\nrife in our time, and above all it must be delivered from that\r\nmaterialistic infidelity, which, by robbing nature of the spiritual\r\nelement, and of its presiding Divinity, makes science dry, barren, and\r\nrepulsive, diminishes its educational value, and even renders it less\r\nefficient for purposes of practical research.\r\n\r\nThat the want of these preliminary conditions mars much of the popular\r\nscience of our day is too evident; and I confess that the wish to\r\nattempt something better, and thereby to revive the interest in\r\ngeological study, to attract attention to its educational value, and\r\nto remove the misapprehensions which exist in some quarters respecting\r\nit, were principal reasons which induced me to undertake the series of\r\npapers for the _Leisure Hour_, which are reproduced, with some\r\namendments and extension, in the present work. How far I have\r\nsucceeded, I must leave to the intelligent and, I trust, indulgent\r\nreader to decide. In any case I have presented this many-sided subject\r\nin the aspect in which it appears to a geologist whose studies have\r\nled him to compare with each other the two great continental areas\r\nwhich are the classic ground of the science, and who retains his faith\r\nin those unseen realities of which the history of the earth itself is\r\nbut one of the shadows projected on the field of time.\r\n\r\nTo geologists who may glance at the following pages, I would say\r\nthat, amidst much that is familiar, they will find here and there some\r\nfacts which may be new to them, as well as some original suggestions\r\nand conclusions as to the relations of things, which though stated in\r\nfamiliar terms, I have not advanced without due consideration of a\r\nwide range of facts, To the general reader I have endeavoured to\r\npresent the more important results of geological investigation\r\ndivested of technical difficulties, yet with a careful regard to\r\naccuracy of statement, and in such a manner as to invite to the\r\nfarther and more precise study of the subject in nature, and in works\r\nwhich enter into technical details. I have endeavoured as far as\r\npossible to mention the authors of important discoveries; but it is\r\nimpossible in a work of this kind to quote authority for every\r\nstatement, while the omission of much important matter relating to the\r\ntopics discussed is also unavoidable. Shortcomings in these respects\r\nmust be remedied by the reader himself, with the aid of systematic\r\ntext-books. Those who may desire any farther explanation of the\r\noccasional allusions to the record of creation in Genesis, will find\r\nthis in my previously published volume entitled \"Archaia.\"\r\n\r\n    J.

The last\r\nqualification is absolutely necessary, when dealing with a science\r\nwhose goal to-day will be its starting point to-morrow, and in whose\r\nview every geological picture must have its light and shaded portions,\r\nits clear foreground and its dim distance, varying according to the\r\nlights cast on them by the progress of investigation, and according to\r\nthe standpoint of the observer. In such pictures results only can be\r\ngiven, not the processes by which they have been obtained; and with\r\nall possible gradations of light and distance, it may be that the\r\nartist will bring into too distinct outline facts still only dimly\r\nperceived, or will give too little prominence to others which, should\r\nappear in bold relief. He must in this judge for himself; and if the\r\nwriter's impressions do not precisely correspond with those of others,\r\nhe trusts that they will allow something for difference of vision and\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty above referred to perhaps rises to its maximum in the\r\npresent chapter. For how can any one paint chaos, or give form and\r\nfilling to the formless void? Perhaps no word-picture of this period\r\nof the first phase of mundane history can ever equal the two negative\r\ntouches of the inspired penman--\"without form and void\"--a world\r\ndestitute of all its present order, and destitute of all that gives it\r\nlife and animation. This it was, and not a complete and finished\r\nearth, that sprang at first from its Creator's hand; and we must\r\ninquire in this first chapter what information science gives as to any\r\nsuch condition of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the geological history of the earth plainly\r\nintimates a beginning, by utterly negativing the idea that \"all things\r\ncontinue as they were from the creation of the world.\" It traces back\r\nto their origin not only the animals and plants which at present live,\r\nbut also their predecessors, through successive dynasties emerging in\r\nlong procession from the depths of a primitive antiquity. Not only so;\r\nit assigns to their relative ages all the rocks of the earth's crust,\r\nand all the plains and mountains built up of them. Thus, as we go back\r\nin geological time, we leave behind us, one by one, all the things\r\nwith which we are familiar, and the inevitable conclusion gains on us\r\nthat we must be approaching a beginning, though this may be veiled\r\nfrom us in clouds and thick darkness. How is it, then, that there are\r\n\"Uniformitarians\" in geology, and that it has been said that our\r\nscience shows no traces of a beginning, no indications of an end? The\r\nquestion deserves consideration; but the answer is not difficult. In\r\nall the lapse of geological time there has been an absolute uniformity\r\nof natural law. The same grand machinery of force and matter has been\r\nin use throughout all the ages, working out the great plan. Yet the\r\nplan has been progressive and advancing, nevertheless. The uniformity\r\nhas been in the methods, the results have presented a wondrous\r\ndiversity and development. Again, geology, in its oldest periods,\r\nfails to reach the beginning of things. It shows us how course after\r\ncourse of the building has been laid, and how it has grown to\r\ncompleteness, but it contains as yet no record of the laying of the\r\nfoundation-stones, still less of the quarry whence they were dug.\r\nStill the constant progress which we have seen points to a beginning\r\nwhich we have not seen; and the very uniformity of the process by\r\nwhich the edifice has been erected, implies a time when it had not\r\nbeen begun, and when its stones were still reposing in their native\r\nquarry.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the oldest condition of the earth actually shown to us\r\nby geology,--that which prevailed in the Eozoic or Laurentian period,\r\nwhen the oldest rocks known, those constituting the foundation-stones\r\nof our present continents, were formed and laid in their places? With\r\nregard to physical conditions, it was a time when our existing\r\ncontinents were yet in the bosom of the waters, when the ocean was\r\nalmost universal, yet when sediments were being deposited in it as at\r\npresent, while there were also volcanic foci, vomiting forth molten\r\nmatter from the earth's hidden interior. Then, as now, the great\r\nphysical agencies of water and fire were contending with one another\r\nfor the mastery, doing and undoing, building up and breaking down. But\r\nis this all? Has the earth no earlier history? that it must have had,\r\nwe may infer from many indications; but as to the nature of these\r\nearlier states, we can learn from conjecture and inference merely, and\r\nmust have recourse to other witnesses then those rocky monuments which\r\nare the sure guides of the geologist.\r\n\r\nOne fact bearing on these questions which has long excited attention,\r\nis the observed increase in temperature in descending into deep mines,\r\nand in the water of deep artesian wells--an increase which may be\r\nstated in round numbers at one degree of heat of the centigrade\r\nthermometer for every 100 feet of depth from the surface. These\r\nobservations apply of course to a very inconsiderable depth, and we\r\nhave no certainty that this rate continues for any great distance\r\ntowards the centre of the earth. If, however, We regard it as\r\nindicating the actual law of increase of temperature, it would result\r\nthat the whole crust of the earth is a mere shell covering a molten\r\nmass of rocky matter. Thus a very slight step of imagination would\r\ncarry us back to a time when this slender crust had not yet formed,\r\nand the earth rolled through space an incandescent globe, with all its\r\nwater and other vaporisable matters in a gaseous state. Astronomical\r\ncalculation has, however, shown that the earth, in its relation to the\r\nother heavenly bodies, obeys the laws of a rigid ball, and not of a\r\nfluid globe. Hence it has been inferred that its actual crust must be\r\nvery thick, perhaps not less then 2,500 miles, and that its fluid\r\nportion must therefore be of smaller dimensions then has been inferred\r\nfrom the observed increase of temperature. Further, it seems to have\r\nbeen rendered probable, from the density of rocky matter in the solid\r\nand liquid states, that a molten globe would solidify at the centre as\r\nwell as at the surface, and consequently that the earth must not only\r\nhave a solid crust of great thickness, but also a solid nucleus, and\r\nthat any liquid portions must be of the nature of a sheet or of\r\ndetached masses intervening between these. On the other hand, it has\r\nrecently been maintained that the calculations which are supposed to\r\nhave established the great thickness of the crust, on the ground that\r\nthe earth does not change its form in obedience to the attraction of\r\nthe sun and moon, are based on a misconception, and that a molten\r\nglobe with a thin crust would attain to such a state of equilibrium in\r\nthis respect as not to be distinguishable from a solid planet. This\r\nview has been maintained by the French physicist, Delaunay, and for\r\nsome time it made geologists suppose that, after all, the earth's\r\ncrust may be very thin. Sir William Thomson, however, and Archdeacon\r\nPratt, have ably maintained the previous opinion, based on Hopkins'\r\ncalculations; and it is now believed that we may rest upon this as\r\nrepresenting the most probable condition of the interior of the earth\r\nat present. Another fact bearing on this point is the form of the\r\nearth, which is now actually a spheroid of rotation; that is, of such\r\na shape as would result from the action of gravity and centrifugal\r\nforce in the motion of a huge liquid drop rotating in the manner in\r\nwhich the earth rotates. Of course it may be said that the earth may\r\nhave been made in that shape to fit it for its rotation; but science\r\nprefers to suppose that the form is the result of the forces acting on\r\nit. This consideration would of course corroborate the deductions from\r\nthat just mentioned. Again, if we examine a map showing the\r\ndistribution of volcanoes upon the earth, and trace these along the\r\nvolcanic belt of Western America and Eastern Asia, and in the Pacific\r\nIslands, and in the isolated volcanic regions in other parts of the\r\nworld; and if we add to these the multitude of volcanoes now extinct,\r\nwe shall be convinced that the sources of internal heat, of which\r\nthese are the vents, must be present almost everywhere under the\r\nearth's crust. Lastly, if we consider the elevations and depressions\r\nwhich large portions of the crust of the earth have undergone in\r\ngeological time, and the actual crumpling and folding of the crust\r\nvisible in great mountain chains, we arrive at a similar conclusion,\r\nand also become convinced that the crust has been not too thick to\r\nadmit of extensive fractures, flexures, and foldings. There are,\r\nhowever, it must be admitted, theories of volcanic action, strongly\r\nsupported by the chemical nature of the materials ejected by modern\r\nvolcanoes, which would refer all their phenomena to the softening,\r\nunder the continued influence of heat and water, of materials within\r\nthe crust of the earth rather then under it.[A] Still, the phenomena\r\nof volcanic action, and of elevation and subsidence, would, under any\r\nexplanation, suppose intense heat, and therefore probably an original\r\nincandescent condition.\r\n\r\n[A] Dr. T. Sterry Hunt, in Silliman'a Journal, 1870.\r\n\r\nLa Place long ago based a theory of the originally gaseous condition\r\nof the solar system on the relation of the planets to each other, and\r\nto the sun, on their planes of revolution, the direction of their\r\nrevolution, and that of their satellites. On these grounds he inferred\r\nthat the solar system had been formed out of a nebulous mass by the\r\nmutual attraction of its parts. This view was further strengthened by\r\nthe discovery of nebulae, which it might be supposed were undergoing\r\nthe same processes by which the solar system was produced. This\r\nnebular theory, as it was called, was long very popular. It was\r\nsubsequently supposed to be damaged by the fact that some of the\r\nnebulæ which had been regarded as systems in progress of formation\r\nwere found by improved telescopes to be really clusters of stars, and\r\nit was inferred that the others might be of like character. The\r\nspectroscope has, however, more recently shown that some nebulæ are\r\nactually gaseous; and it has even been attempted to demonstrate that\r\nthey are probably undergoing change fitting them to become systems.\r\nThis has served to revive the nebular hypothesis, which has been\r\nfurther strengthened by the known fact that the sun is still an\r\nincandescent globe surrounded by an immense luminous envelope of\r\nvapours rising from its nucleus and condensing at its surface. On the\r\nother hand, while the sun may be supposed, from its great magnitude,\r\nto remain intensely heated, and while it will not be appreciably less\r\npowerful for myriads of years, the moon seems to be a body which has\r\nhad time to complete the whole history of geological change, and to\r\nbecome a dry, dead, and withered world, a type of what our earth would\r\nin process of time actually become.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figs. 1 to 5._--_Ideal sections illustrating the\r\nGenesis of the Earth._\r\n\r\nFig. 1.

In all the figures (_a_)\r\nrepresents vapour or air; (_b_) liquid rock; (_c_) solid rock as a\r\ncrust; (_d_) solid nucleus; (_e_) water.]\r\n\r\nSuch considerations lead to the conclusion that the former watery\r\ncondition of our planet was not its first state, and that we must\r\ntrace it back to a previous reign of fire. The reasons which can be\r\nadduced in support of this are no doubt somewhat vague, and may in\r\ntheir details be variously interpreted; but at present we have no\r\nother interpretation to give of that chaos, formless and void, that\r\nstate in which \"nor aught nor nought existed,\" which the sacred\r\nwritings and the traditions and poetry of ancient nations concur with\r\nmodern science in indicating as the primitive state of the earth.\r\n\r\nLet our first picture, then, be that of a vaporous mass, representing\r\nour now solid planet spread out over a space nearly two thousand times\r\ngreater in diameter then that which it now occupies, and whirling in\r\nits annual round about the still vaporous centre of our system, in\r\nwhich at an earlier period the earth had been but an exterior layer,\r\nor ring of vapour. The atoms that now constitute the most solid rocks\r\nare in this state as tenuous as air, kept apart by the expansive force\r\nof heat, which prevents not only their mechanical union, but also\r\ntheir chemical combination. But within the mass, slowly and silently,\r\nthe force of gravitation is compressing the particles in its giant\r\nhand, and gathering the denser toward the centre, while heat is given\r\nforth on all sides from the condensing mass into the voids of space\r\nwithout. Little by little the denser and less volatile matters collect\r\nin the centre as a fluid molten globe, the nucleus of the future\r\nplanet; and in this nucleus the elements, obeying their chemical\r\naffinities hitherto latent, are arranging themselves in compounds\r\nwhich are to constitute the future rocks. At the same time, in the\r\nexterior of the vaporous envelope, matters cooled by radiation into\r\nthe space without, are combining with each other, and are being\r\nprecipitated in earthy rain or snow into the seething mass within,\r\nwhere they are either again vaporised and sent to the surface or\r\nabsorbed in the increasing nucleus. As this process advances, a new\r\nbrilliancy is given to the faint shining of the nebulous matter by the\r\nincandescence of these solid particles in the upper layers of its\r\natmosphere, a condition which at this moment, on a greater scale, is\r\nthat of the sun; in the case of the earth, so much smaller in volume,\r\nand farther from the centre of the system, it came on earlier, and has\r\nlong since passed away. This was the glorious starlike condition of\r\nour globe: in a physical point of view, its most perfect and beautiful\r\nstate, when, if there were astronomers with telescopes in the stars,\r\nthey might have seen our now dull earth flash forth--a brilliant white\r\nstar secondary to the sun.\r\n\r\nBut in process of time this passes away. All the more solid and less\r\nvolatile substances are condensed and precipitated; and now the\r\natmosphere, still vast in bulk, and dark and misty in texture,\r\ncontains only the water, chlorine, carbonic acid, sulphuric acid, and\r\nother more volatile substances; and as these gather in dense clouds at\r\nthe outer surface, and pour in fierce corrosive rains upon the heated\r\nnucleus, combining with its materials, or flashing again into vapour,\r\ndarkness dense and gross settles upon the vaporous deep, and continues\r\nfor long ages, until the atmosphere is finally cleared of its acid\r\nvapours and its superfluous waters.[B] In the meantime, radiation, and\r\nthe heat abstracted from the liquid nucleus by the showers of\r\ncondensing material from the atmosphere, have so far cooled its\r\nsurface that a crust of slag or cinder forms upon it. Broken again and\r\nagain by the heavings of the ocean of fire, it at length sets\r\npermanently, and receives upon its bare and blistered surface the\r\never-increasing aqueous and acid rain thrown down from the\r\natmosphere, at first sending it all hissing and steaming back, but at\r\nlength allowing it to remain a universal boiling ocean. Then began the\r\nreign of the waters, and the dominion of fire was confined to the\r\nabysses within the solid crust. Under the primeval ocean were formed\r\nthe first stratified rocks, from the substances precipitated from its\r\nwaters, which must have been loaded with solid matter. We must not\r\nimagine this primeval ocean like our own blue sea, clear and\r\ntransparent, but filled with earthy and saline matters, thick and\r\nturbid, until these were permitted to settle to the bottom and form\r\nthe first sediments. The several changes above referred to are\r\nrepresented in diagrammatic form in figs. 1 to 4.\r\n\r\n[B] Hunt, \"Chemistry of the Primeval Earth,\" _Silliman's Journal_, 1858.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime all is not at rest in the interior of the new-formed\r\nearth. Under the crust vast oceans of molten rock may still remain,\r\nbut a solid interior nucleus is being crystallised in the centre, and\r\nthe whole interior globe is gradually shrinking. At length this\r\nprocess advances so far that the exterior crust, like a sheet of ice\r\nfrom below which the water has subsided, is left unsupported; and with\r\nterrible earthquake-throes it sinks downward, wrinkling up into huge\r\nfolds, between which are vast sunken areas into which the waters\r\nsubside, while from the intervening ridges the earth's pent-up fires\r\nbelch forth ashes and molten rocks. (Fig. 5.) So arose the first dry\r\nland:--\r\n\r\n               \"The mountains huge appear\r\n     Emergent, and their broad bare backs upheave\r\n     Into the clouds, their tops ascend the sky,\r\n     So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low\r\n     Down sunk a hollow bottom, broad and deep,\r\n     Capacious bed of waters.\"\r\n\r\nThe cloud was its garment, it was swathed in thick darkness, and\r\npresented but a rugged pile of rocky precipices; yet well might the\r\n\"morning stars sing together, and all the sons of God shout with joy,\"\r\nwhen its foundations were settled and its corner-stone laid, for then\r\nwere inaugurated the changes which were to lead to the introduction of\r\nlife on the earth, and to all the future development of the\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nPhysical geographers have taught us that the great continents, whether\r\nwe regard their coasts or their mountain chains, are built up on lines\r\nwhich run north-east and south-west, and north-west and south-east;\r\nand it is also observed that these lines are great circles of the\r\nearth tangent to the polar circle. Further, we find, as a result of\r\ngeological investigation, that these lines determined the deposition\r\nand the elevation of the oldest rocks known to us. Hence it is fair to\r\ninfer that these were the original directions of the first lines of\r\nfracture and upheaval. Whether these lines were originally drawn by\r\nthe influence of of the seasons on the cooling globe, or by the\r\ncurrents of its molten interior, or of the superficial ocean, they\r\nbespeak a most uniform and equable texture for the crust, and a\r\ndefinite law of fracture and upheaval; and they have modified all the\r\nsubsequent action of the ocean as a depositor of sediment, and of the\r\ninternal heat as a cause of alteration and movement of rocks. Against\r\nthese earliest belts of land the ocean first chafed and foamed. Along\r\ntheir margins marine denudation first commenced, and the oceanic\r\ncurrents first deposited banks of sediment; and along these first\r\nlines have the volcanic orifices of all periods been most plentiful,\r\nand elevatory movements most powerfully felt.\r\n\r\nWe must not suppose that the changes thus shortly sketched were rapid\r\nand convulsive. They must have required periods of enormous duration,\r\nall of which had elapsed before the beginning of geological time,\r\nproperly so called. From Sir William Thomson's calculations, it would\r\nappear that the time which has elapsed from the first formation of a\r\nsolid crust on the earth to the modern period may have been from\r\nseventy to one hundred millions of years, and the whole time from the\r\nvaporous condition of the solar system to the present, must of course\r\nhave been still greater then even this enormous series of ages. Such a\r\nlapse of time is truly almost inconceivable, but it is only a few days\r\nto Him with whom one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years\r\nas one day. How many and strange pictures does this series of\r\nprocesses call up! First, the uniform vaporous nebula. Then the\r\nformation of a liquid nucleus, and a brilliant photosphere without.\r\nThen the congealing of a solid crust under dark atmospheric vapours,\r\nand the raining down of acid and watery showers. Then the universal\r\nocean, its waves rolling unobstructed around the globe, and its\r\ncurrents following without hindrance the leading of heat and of the\r\nearth's rotation. Then the rupture of the crust and the emergence of\r\nthe nuclei of continents.\r\n\r\nSome persons seem to think that by these long processes of creative\r\nwork we exclude the Creator, and would reduce the universe into a mere\r\nfortuitous concourse of atoms. To put it in more modern phrase, \"given\r\na quantity of detached fragments cast into space, then mutual\r\ngravitation and the collision of the fragments would give us the\r\nspangled heavens.\" But we have still to ask the old question, \"Whence\r\nthe atoms?\" and we have to ask it with all the added weight of our\r\nmodern chemistry, so marvellous in its revelations of the original\r\ndifferences of matter and their varied powers of combination. We have\r\nto ask, What is gravitation itself, unless a mode of action of\r\nAlmighty power? We have to ask for the origin of of thousands of\r\ncorrelations, binding together the past and the future in that orderly\r\nchain of causes and effects which constitutes the plan of the\r\ncreation. If it pleased God to create in the beginning an earth\r\n\"formless and void\" and to elaborate from this all that has since\r\nexisted, who are we, to say that the plan was not the best? Nor would\r\nit detract from our view of the creative wisdom and power if we were\r\nto hold that in ages to come the sun may experience the same change\r\nthat has befallen the earth, and may become \"black as sackcloth of\r\nhair,\" preparatory perhaps, to changes which may make him also the\r\nabode of life; or if the earth, cooling still further, should, like\r\nour satellite the moon, absorb all its waters and gases into its\r\nbosom, and become bare, dry, and parched, until there shall be \"no\r\nmore sea\" how do we know but that then there shall be no more need of\r\nthe sun, because a better light may be provided? Or that there may not\r\nbe a new baptism of fire in store for the earth, whereby, being melted\r\nwith fervent heat, it may renew its youth in the fresh and heavenly\r\nloveliness of a new heaven and a new earth, free from all the evils\r\nand imperfections of the present? God is not slack in these things, as\r\nsome men count slackness; but His ways are not like our ways. He has\r\neternity wherein to do His work, and takes His own time for each of\r\nHis operations. The Divine wisdom, personified by a sacred writer, may\r\nwell in this exalt his own office:--\r\n\r\n     \"Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of His way,\r\n      Before His work of old.\r\n      I was set up from everlasting,\r\n      From the beginning, or ever the earth was.\r\n      When there were no deeps, T was brought forth;\r\n      When there were no fountains abounding in water.\r\n      Before the mountains were settled,\r\n      Before the hills, was I brought forth:\r\n      While as yet He had not made the earth,\r\n      Nor the plains, nor the higher part of the habitable world,\r\n      When He gave the sea His decree,\r\n      that her waters should not pass His limits;\r\n      When He determined the foundations of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE EOZOIC AGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dominion of heat has passed away; the excess of water has been\r\nprecipitated from the atmosphere, and now covers the earth as a\r\nuniversal ocean. The crust has folded itself into long ridges, the bed\r\nof the waters has subsided into its place, and the sea for the first\r\ntime begins to rave against the shores of the newly elevated land,\r\nwhile the rain, washing the bare surfaces of rocky ridges, carries its\r\ncontribution of the slowly wasting rocks back into the waters whence\r\nthey were raised, forming, with the material worn from the crust by\r\nthe surf, the first oceanic sediments. Do we know any of these\r\nearliest aqueous beds, or are they all hidden from view beneath newer\r\ndeposits, or have they been themselves worn away and destroyed by\r\ndenuding agencies? Whether we know the earliest formed sediments is,\r\nand may always remain, uncertain; but we do know certain very ancient\r\nrocks which may be at least their immediate successors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--The Laurentian nucleus of the American\r\ncontinent.]\r\n\r\nDeepest and oldest of all the rocks we are acquainted with in the\r\ncrust of the earth, are certain beds much altered and metamorphosed,\r\nbaked by the joint action of heat and heated moisture--rocks once\r\ncalled Azoic, as containing no traces of life, but for which I have\r\nelsewhere proposed the name \"Eozoic,\" or those that afford the traces\r\nof the earliest known living beings. These rocks are the Laurentian\r\nSeries of Sir William Logan, so named from the Laurentide hills, north\r\nof the River St. Lawrence, which are composed of these ancient beds,\r\nand where they are more largely exposed then in any other region. It\r\nmay seem at first sight strange that any of these ancient rocks should\r\nbe found at the surface of the earth; but this is a necessary result\r\nof the mode of formation of the continents. The oldest rocks, thrown\r\nup in places into high ridges, have either not been again brought\r\nunder the waters, or have lost by denudation the sediments once\r\nresting on them; and being of a hard and resisting nature, still\r\nremain; and often rise into hills of considerable elevation, showing\r\nas it were portions of the skeleton of the earth protruding through\r\nits superficial covering. Such rocks stretch along the north side of\r\nthe St. Lawrence river from Labrador to Lake Superior, and thence\r\nnorthwardly to an unknown distance, constituting a wild and rugged\r\ndistrict often rising into hills 4000 feet high, and in the deep gorge\r\nof the Saguenay forming cliffs 1,500 feet in sheer height from the\r\nwater's edge. South of this great ridge, the isolated mass of the\r\nAdirondack Mountains rises to the height of 6,000 feet, rivalling the\r\nnewer, though still very ancient, chain of the White Mountains. Along\r\nthe eastern coast of North America, a lower ridge of Laurentian rock,\r\nonly appearing here and there from under the overlying sediments, is\r\nseen in Newfoundland, in New Brunswick, possibly in Nova Scotia, and\r\nperhaps farther south in Massachusetts, and as far as Maryland. In the\r\nold world, rocks of this age do not, so far as known, appear so\r\nextensively. They have been recognised in Norway and Sweden, in the\r\nHebrides, and in Bavaria, and may, no doubt, be yet discerned in other\r\nlocalities. Still, the grandest and most instructive development of\r\nthese rocks is in North America; and it is there that we may best\r\ninvestigate their nature, and endeavour to restore the conditions in\r\nwhich they were deposited. It has been already stated that the oldest\r\nwrinkles of the crust of the globe take the direction of great circles\r\nof the earth tangent to the polar circle, forming north-east and\r\nsouth-west, and north-west and south-east lines. To such lines are the\r\ngreat exposures of Laurentian rock conformed, as may be well seen from\r\nthe map of North America (fig. 6), taken from Dana, with some\r\nadditions. The great angular Laurentian belt is evidently the nucleus\r\nof the continent, and consists of two broad bands or ridges meeting in\r\nthe region of the great lakes. The remaining exposures are parallel to\r\nthese, and appear to indicate a subordinate coast-line of\r\ncomparatively little elevation. It is known that these Laurentian\r\nexposures constitute the oldest part of the continent, a part which\r\nwas land before any of the rocks of the shaded portion of the map were\r\ndeposited in the bed of the ocean--all this shaded portion being\r\ncomposed of rocks of various geological ages resting on the older\r\nLaurentian. It is further to be observed that the beds occurring in\r\nthe Laurentian bands are crumpled and folded in a most remarkable\r\nmanner, and that these folds were impressed upon them before the\r\ndeposition of the rocks next in geological age.\r\n\r\nWhat then are these oldest rocks deposited by the sea--the first-born\r\nof the reign of the waters? They are very different in their external\r\naspect from the silt and mud, the sand and gravel, and the shell and\r\ncoral rocks of the modern sea, or of the more recent geological\r\nformations. Yet the difference is one in condition rather then\r\ncomposition. The members of this ancient aristocracy of the rocks are\r\nmade of the same clay with their fellows, but have been subjected to a\r\nrefining and crystallizing process which has greatly changed their\r\ncondition. They have been, as geologists say, metamorphosed; and are\r\nto ordinary rocks what a china vase is to the lump of clay from which\r\nit has been made. Deeply buried in the earth under newer sediments,\r\nthey have been baked, until sandstones, gravels, and clays came out\r\nbright and crystalline, as gneiss, mica-schist, hornblende-schist, and\r\nquartzite--all hard crystalline rocks showing at first sight no\r\nresemblance to their original material, except in the regularly\r\nstratified or bedded arrangement which serves to distinguish them from\r\nigneous or volcanic rocks. In like manner certain finer, calcareous\r\nsediments have been changed into Labrador feldspar, sometimes gay with\r\na beautiful play of colour, and what were once common limestones\r\nappear as crystalline marble. If the evidence of such metamorphoses is\r\nasked for, this is twofold. In the first place, these rocks are\r\nsimilar in structure to more modern beds which have been partially\r\nmetamorphosed, and in which the transition from the unaltered to the\r\naltered state can be observed. Secondly, there are limited areas in\r\nthe Laurentian itself, in which the metamorphism has been so imperfect\r\nas to permit traces of the original character of the rocks to remain.\r\nIt seems also quite certain, and this is a most important point for\r\nour sketch, that the Laurentian ocean was not universal, but that\r\nthere were already elevated portions of the crust capable of yielding\r\nsediment to the sea.\r\n\r\nIn North America these Laurentian rocks attain to an enormous\r\nthickness. This has been estimated by Sir W. E. Logan at 30,000 feet,\r\nso that the beds would, if piled on each other horizontally, be as\r\nhigh as the highest mountains on earth. They appear to consist of two\r\ngreat series, the Lower and Upper Laurentian. Even if we suppose that\r\nin the earlier stages of the world's history erosion and deposition\r\nwere somewhat more rapid then at present, the formation of such\r\ndeposits, probably more widely spread then any that succeeded them,\r\nmust have required an enormous length of time.\r\n\r\nGeologists long looked in vain for evidences of life in the Laurentian\r\nperiod; but just as astronomers' have suspected the existence of\r\nunknown planets from the perturbations due to their attraction,\r\ngeologists have guessed that there must have been some living things\r\non earth even at this early time. Dana and Sterry Hunt especially have\r\ncommitted themselves to such speculations. The reasons for this belief\r\nmay be stated thus: (1.) In later formations limestone is usually an\r\norganic rock, produced by the accumulation of shells, corals, and\r\nsimilar calcareous organisms in the sea, and there are enormous\r\nlimestones in the Laurentian, constituting regular beds. (2.) In\r\nlater formations coaly matter is an organic substance, derived from\r\nvegetables, and there are large quantities of Laurentian carbon in the\r\nform of graphite. (3.) In later formations deposits of iron ores are\r\nalmost always connected with the deoxidising influence of organic\r\nmatters as an efficient cause of their accumulation, and the\r\nLaurentian contains immense deposits of iron ore, occurring in layers\r\nin the manner of later deposits of these minerals. (4.) The limestone,\r\ncarbon, and iron of the Laurentian exist in association with the other\r\nbeds in the same manner as in the later formations in which they are\r\nknown to be organic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--_Eozoon Canadense._ Dawson.\r\n\r\nThe oldest known animal. Portion of skeleton, two-thirds natural size,\r\n(_a_) Tabulated cell-wall, magnified, (_b_) Portion of canal system,\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to this inferential evidence, however, one well-marked\r\nanimal fossil has at length been found in the Laurentian of Canada,\r\nEozoon Canadense, (fig. 7), a gigantic representative of one of the\r\nlowest forms of animal life, which the writer had the honour of naming\r\nand describing in 1865--its name of \"Dawn-animal\" having reference to\r\nits great antiquity and possible connection with the dawn of life on\r\nour planet. In the modern seas, among the multitude of low forms of\r\nlife with which they swarm, occur some in which the animal matter is a\r\nmere jelly, almost without distinct parts or organs, yet\r\nunquestionably endowed with life of an animal character. Some of these\r\ncreatures, the Foraminifera, have the power of secreting at the\r\nsurface of their bodies a calcareous shell, often divided into\r\nnumerous chambers, communicating with each other, and with the water\r\nwithout, by pores or orifices through which, the animal can extend\r\nsoft and delicate prolongations of its gelatinous body, which, when\r\nstretched out into the water, serve for arms and legs. In modern times\r\nthese creatures, though extremely abundant in the ocean, are usually\r\nsmall, often microscopic; but in a fossil state there are others of\r\nsomewhat larger size, though few equaling the Eozoon, which seems to\r\nbeen a sessile creature, resting on the bottom of the sea, and\r\ncovering its gelatinous body with a thin crust of carbonate of lime or\r\nlimestone, adding to this, as it grew in size, crust after crust,\r\nattached to each other by numerous partitions, and perforated with\r\npores for the emission of gelatinous filaments. This continued growth\r\nof gelatinous animal matter and carbonate of lime went on from age to\r\nage, accumulating great beds of limestone, in some of which the entire\r\nform and most minute structures of the creature are preserved, while\r\nin other cases the organisms have been broken up, and the limestones\r\nare a mere congeries of their fragments. It is a remarkable instance\r\nof the permanence of fossils, that in these ancient organisms the\r\nminutest pores through which the semi-fluid matter of these humble\r\nanimals passed, have been preserved in the most delicate perfection.\r\nThe existence of such creatures supposes that of other organisms,\r\nprobably microscopic plants, on which they could feed. No traces of\r\nthese have been observed, though the great quantity of carbon in the\r\nbeds probably implies the existence of larger sea-weeds. No other form\r\nof animal has yet been distinctly recognized in the Laurentian\r\nlimestones, but there are fragments of calcareous matter which may\r\nhave belonged to organisms distinct from Eozoon. Of life on the\r\nLaurentian land we know nothing, unless the great beds of iron ore\r\nalready referred to may be taken as a proof of land vegetation.[C]\r\n\r\n[C] It is proper to state here that some geologists and naturalists\r\nstill doubt the organic nature of Eozoon. Their objections however, so\r\nfar as stated publicly, have been shown to depend on misapprehension\r\nas to the structures observed and their state of preservation; and\r\nspecimens recently found in comparatively unaltered rocks have\r\nindicated the true character of those more altered by metamorphism.\r\n\r\nTo an observer in the Laurentian period, the earth would have\r\npresented an almost boundless ocean, its waters, perhaps, still warmed\r\nwith the internal heat, and sending up copious exhalations to be\r\ncondensed in thick clouds and precipitated in rain. Here and there\r\nmight be seen chains of rocky islands, many of them volcanic, or\r\nranges of bleak hills, perhaps clothed with vegetation the forms of\r\nwhich are unknown to us. In the bottom of the sea, while sand and mud\r\nand gravel were being deposited in successive layers in some portions\r\nof the ocean floor, in others great reefs of Eozoon were growing up in\r\nthe manner of reefs of coral. If we can imagine the modern Pacific,\r\nwith its volcanic islands and reefs of coral, to be deprived of all\r\nother forms of life, 'we should have a somewhat accurate picture of\r\nthe Eozoic time as it appears to us now. I say as it appears to us\r\nnow; for we do not know what new discoveries remain to be made. More\r\nespecially the immense deposits of carbon and iron in the Laurentian\r\nwould seem to bespeak a profusion of plant life in the sea or on the\r\nland, or both, second to that of no other period that succeeded,\r\nexcept that of the great coal formation. Perhaps no remnant of this\r\nprimitive vegetation exists retaining its form or structure; but we\r\nmay hope for better things, and cherish the expectation that some\r\nfortunate discovery may still reveal to us the forms of the vegetation\r\nof the Laurentian time.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the humbly organized living things which built\r\nup the Laurentian limestones have continued to exist unchanged, save\r\nin dimensions, up to modern times; and here and there throughout the\r\ngeological series we find beds of Foraminiferous limestone, similar,\r\nexcept in the species of Foraminifera composing them, to that of the\r\nLaurentian. It is true that other kinds of creatures, the coral\r\nanimals more particularly, have been introduced, and have proved\r\nequally efficient builders of limestones; but in the deeper parts of\r\nthe sea the Foraminifera continue to assert their pre-eminence in this\r\nrespect, and the dredge reveals in the depths of our modern oceans\r\nbeds of calcareous matter which may be regarded as identical in origin\r\nwith the limestones formed in the period which is to us the dawn of\r\norganic life.\r\n\r\nMany inquiries suggest themselves to the zoologist in connection with\r\nthe life of the Laurentian period. Was Eozoon the first creature in\r\nwhich the wondrous forces of animal life were manifested, when, in\r\nobedience to the Divine fiat, the waters first \"swarmed with\r\nswarmers,\" as the terse and expressive language of the Mosaic record\r\nphrases it? If so, in contemplating this organism we are in the\r\npresence of one of the greatest of natural wonders--brought nearer\r\nthen in any other case to the actual workshop of the Almighty Maker.\r\nStill we cannot affirm that other creatures even more humble may not\r\nhave preceded Eozoon, since such humble organisms are known in the\r\npresent world. Attempts have often been made, and very recently have\r\nbeen renewed with much affirmation of success, to prove that such low\r\nforms of life may originate spontaneously from their materials in the\r\nwaters; but so far these attempts merely prove that the invisible\r\ngerms of the lower animals and plants exist everywhere, and that they\r\nhave marvellous powers of resisting extreme heat and other injurious\r\ninfluences. We need not, therefore, be surprised if even lower forms\r\nthen Eozoon may have preceded that creature, or if some of these may\r\nbe found, like the organisms said to live in modern boiling springs,\r\nto have had the power of existing even at a time when the ocean may\r\nhave been almost in a state of ebullition. Another problem is that of\r\nmeans of subsistence for the Eozoic Foraminifera. A similar problem\r\nexists in the case of the modern ocean, in whose depths live\r\nmultitudes of creatures, where, so far as we know, vegetable matter,\r\nordinarily the basis of life, cannot exist in a living condition. It\r\nis probable, however, from the researches of Dr. Wyville Thompson,\r\nthat this is to be accounted for by the abundance of life at the\r\nsurface and in the shallower parts of the sea, and by the consequent\r\ndiffusion through the water of organic matter in an extremely tenuous\r\nstate, but yet sufficient to nourish these creatures. The same may\r\nhave been the case in the Eozoic sea, where, judging from the vast\r\namount of residual carbon, there must have been abundance of organic\r\nmatter, either growing at the bottom, or falling upon it from the\r\nsurface; and as the Eozoon limestones are usually free from such\r\nmaterial, we may assume that the animal life in them was sufficient to\r\nconsume the vegetable pabulum. On the other hand, as detached\r\nspecimens of Eozoon occur in graphitic limestones, we suppose that in\r\nsome cases the vegetable matter was in excess of the animal, and this\r\nmay have been either because of its too great exuberance, or because\r\nthe water was locally too shallow to permit Eozoon and similar\r\ncreatures to nourish. These details we must for the present fill up\r\nconjecturally; bu the progress of discovery may give us further light\r\nas to the precise conditions of the beginning of life in the \"great\r\nand wide sea wherein are moving things innumerable\" and which is as\r\nmuch a wonder now as in the days of the author of the \"Hymn of\r\nCreation\"[D] in regard to the life that swarms in all its breadth and\r\ndepth, the vast variety of that life, and its low and simple types, of\r\nwhich we can affirm little else then that they move.\r\n\r\n[D] Psalm civ.\r\n\r\nThe enormous accumulations of sediment on the still thin crust of the\r\nearth in the Laurentian period--accumulations probably arranged in\r\nlines parallel to the directions of disturbance already\r\nindicated--weighed down the surface, and caused great masses of the\r\nsediment to come within the influence of the heated interior nucleus.\r\nThus, extensive metamorphism took place, and at length the tension\r\nbecoming too great to be any longer maintained, a second great\r\ncollapse occurred, crumpling and disturbing the crust, and throwing up\r\nvast masses of the Laurentian itself, probably into lofty\r\nmountains--many of which still remain of considerable height, though\r\nthey have been subjected to erosion throughout all the extent of\r\nsubsequent geological time.\r\n\r\nThe Eozoic age, whose history we have thus shortly sketched, is\r\nfertile in material of thought for the geologist and the naturalist.\r\nUntil the labours of Murchison, Sedgwick, Hall, and Barrande had\r\ndeveloped the vast thickness and organic richness of the Silurian and\r\nCambrian rocks, no geologist had any idea of the extent to which life\r\nhad reached backward in time. But when this new and primitive world of\r\nSiluria was unveiled, men felt assured that they had now at last\r\nreached to the beginnings of life. The argument on this side of the\r\nQuestion was thus put by one of the most thoughtful of English\r\ngeologists, Professor Phillips: \"It is ascertained that in passing\r\ndownwards through the lower Palæozoic strata, the forms of life grow\r\nfewer and fewer, until in the lowest Cambrian rocks they vanish\r\nentirely. In the thick series of these strata in the Longmynd, hardly\r\nany traces of life occur, yet these strata are of such a kind as might\r\nbe expected to yield them.... The materials are fine-grained or\r\narenaceous, with or without mica, in laminae or beds quite distinct,\r\nand of various thicknesses, by no means unlikely to retain\r\nimpressions of a delicate nature, such as those left by graptolites,\r\nor mollusks, or annulose crawlers. Indeed, one or two such traces are\r\nsupposed to have been recognised, so that the almost total absence of\r\nthe traces of life in this enormous series is best understood by the\r\nsupposition that in these parts of the sea little or no life existed.\r\nBut the same remark of the excessive rarity of life in the lower\r\ndeposits is made in North America, in Norway, and in Bohemia,\r\ncountries well searched for this very purpose, so that all our\r\nobservations lead to the conviction that the lowest of all the strata\r\nare quite deficient of organic remains. The absence is general--it\r\nappears due to a general cause. Is it not probable that during these\r\nvery early periods the ocean and its sediments were nearly devoid of\r\nplants and animals, and in the earliest time of all, which is\r\nrepresented by sediments, quite deprived of such?\" These words were\r\nwritten ten years ago, and about the same time were published in\r\nAmerica those anticipations of the probability of life in the\r\nLaurentian already referred to, and Lyell was protesting against the\r\nname Primordial, on the ground that it implied that we had reached the\r\nbeginning of life, when this was not proved. Yet there were elements\r\nof truth in both views. It is true now, as then, that the Primordial\r\nseems to be a morning hour of life, having, as we shall see in our\r\nnext paper, unmistakable signs about it of that approach to the\r\nbeginning to which Phillips refers. It is also true that it is not so\r\nearly a morning hour as one who has not risen with the dawn might\r\nsuppose, since with its apparently small beginnings of life it is\r\nalmost as far removed from the Eozoon reefs of the early Laurentian on\r\nthe one hand, as it is from the modern period on the other. The dawn\r\nof life seems to have been a very slow and protracted process, and it\r\nmay have required as long a time between the first appearance of\r\nEozoon and the first of those primordial Trilobites which the next\r\nperiod will introduce to our notice, as between these and the advent\r\nof Adam. Perhaps no lesson is more instructive then this as to the\r\nlength of the working days of the Almighty.\r\n\r\nAnother lesson lies ready for us in these same facts. Theoretically,\r\nplants should have preceded animals; and this also is the assertion of\r\nthe first chapter of Genesis; but the oldest fossil certainly known to\r\nus is an animal. What if there were still earlier plants, whose\r\nremains are still to be discovered? For my own part, I can see no\r\nreason to despair of the discovery of an _Eophytic_ period preceding\r\nthe Eozoic; perhaps preceding it through ages of duration to us almost\r\nimmeasurable, though still within the possible time of the existence\r\nof the crust of the earth. It is even possible that in a warm and\r\nhumid condition of the atmosphere, before it had been caused \"to rain\r\nupon the earth\" and when dense \"mists ascended from the earth and\r\nwatered the whole surface of the ground,\"[E] vegetation may have\r\nattained to a profusion and grandeur unequalled in the periods whose\r\nflora is known to us.\r\n\r\n[E] Genesis ii. 5. For a description of this Eophytic period of\r\nGenesis, see the Author's \"Archaia,\" pp. 160 _et seq._\r\n\r\nBut while Eozoon thus preaches of progress and of development, it has\r\na tale to tell of unity and sameness Just as Eozoon lived in the\r\nLaurentian sea, and was preserved for us by the infiltration of its\r\ncanals with siliceous mineral matters, so its successors and\r\nrepresentatives have gone on through all the ages accumulating\r\nlimestone in the sea bottom. To-day they are as active as they were\r\nthen, and are being fossilised in the same way. The English chalk and\r\nthe chalky modern mud of the Atlantic sea-bed, are precisely similar\r\nin origin to the Eozoic limestones. There is also a strange\r\nparallelism in the fact that in the modern seas Foraminifera can live\r\nunder conditions of deprivation of light and vital air, and of\r\nenormous pressure, under which few organisms of greater complexity\r\ncould exist, and that in like manner Eozoon could live in seas which\r\nwere perhaps as yet unfit for most other forms of life.\r\n\r\nIt has been attempted to press the Eozoic Foraminifers into the\r\nservice of those theories of evolution which would deduce the animals\r\nof one geological period by descent with modification from those of\r\nanother; but it must be confessed that Eozoon proves somewhat\r\nintractable in this connection. In the first place, the creature is\r\nthe grandest of his class, both in form and structure; and if, on the\r\nhypothesis of derivation, it has required the whole lapse of\r\ngeological time to disintegrate Eozoon into Orbulina, Globigerina,\r\nand other comparatively simple Foraminifers of the modern seas, it may\r\nhave taken as long, probably much longer, to develop Eozoon from such\r\nsimple forms in antecedent periods. Time fails for such a process.\r\nAgain, the deep sea has been the abode of Foraminifers from the first.\r\nIn this deep sea they have continued to live without improvement, and\r\nwith little material change. How little likely is it that in less\r\ncongenial abodes they could have improved into higher grades of being;\r\nespecially since we know that the result in actual fact of any such\r\nstruggle for existence is merely the production of depauperated\r\nForaminifers? Further, there is no link of connection known to us\r\nbetween Eozoon and any of the animals of the succeeding Primordial,\r\nwhich are nearly all essentially new types, vastly more different from\r\nEozoon then it is from many modern creatures. Any such connection is\r\naltogether imaginary and unsupported by proof. The laws of creation\r\nactually illustrated by this primeval animal are only these: First,\r\nthat there has been a progress in creation from few, low, and\r\ngeneralised types of life to more numerous, higher, and more\r\nspecialised types; and secondly, that every type, low or high, was\r\nintroduced at first in its best and highest form, and was, as a type,\r\nsubject to degeneracy, and to partial or total replacement by higher\r\ntypes subsequently introduced. I do not mean that we could learn all\r\nthis from Eozoon alone; but that, rightly considered, it illustrates\r\nthese laws, which we gather from the subsequent progress of the\r\ncreative work. As to the mystery of the origin of living beings from\r\ndead matter, or any changes which they may have undergone after their\r\ncreation, it is absolutely silent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE PRIMORDIAL, OR CAMBRIAN AGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the time when _Eozoon Canadense_ flourished in the seas of the\r\nLaurentian period, and the age which we have been in the habit of\r\ncalling Primordial, or Cambrian, a great gap evidently exists in our\r\nknowledge of the succession of life on both of the continents,\r\nrepresenting a vast lapse of time, in which the beds of the Upper\r\nLaurentian were deposited, and in which the Laurentian sediments were\r\naltered, contorted, and upheaved, before another immense series of\r\nbeds, the Huronian, or Lower Cambrian, was formed in the bottom of the\r\nsea. Eozoon and its companions occur in the Lower Laurentian. The\r\nUpper Laurentian has afforded no evidence of life; and even those\r\nconditions from which we could infer life are absent. The Lowest\r\nCambrian, as we shall see, presents only a few traces of living\r\nbeings. Still, the physical history of this interval must have been\r\nmost important. The wide level bottom of the Laurentian sea was broken\r\nup and thrown into those bold ridges which were to constitute the\r\nnuclei of the existing continents. Along the borders of these new-made\r\nlands intense volcanic eruptions broke forth, producing great\r\nquantities of lava and scoriæ and huge beds of conglomerate and\r\nvolcanic ash, which are characteristic features of the older Cambrian\r\nin both hemispheres. Such conditions, undoubtedly not favourable to\r\nlife, seem to have prevailed, and extended their influence very\r\nwidely, so that the sediments of this period are among the most barren\r\nin fossils of any in the crust of the earth. If any quiet undisturbed\r\nspots existed in which the Lower Laurentian life could be continued\r\nand extended in preparation for the next period, we have yet\r\ndiscovered few of them. The experience of other geological periods\r\nwould, however, entitle us to look for such oases in the Lower\r\nCambrian desert, and to expect to find there some connecting links\r\nbetween the life of the Eozoic and the very dissimilar fauna of the\r\nPrimordial.\r\n\r\nThe western hemisphere, where the Laurentian is so well represented,\r\nis especially unproductive in fossils of the immediately succeeding\r\nperiod. The only known exception is the occurrence of Eozoon and of\r\napparent casts of worm-burrows in rocks at Madoc in Canada, overlying\r\nthe Laurentian, and believed to be of Huronian age, and certain\r\nobscure fossils of uncertain affinities, recently detected by Mr.\r\nBillings, in rocks supposed to be of this age, in Newfoundland. Here,\r\nhowever, the European series comes in to give us some small help.\r\nGümbel has described in Bavaria a great series of gneissic rocks\r\ncorresponding to the Laurentian, or at least to the lower part of it;\r\nabove these are what he calls the Hercynian mica-slate and primitive\r\nclay-slate, in the latter of which he finds a peculiar species of\r\nEozoon, which he names _Eozoon Bavaricum_. In England also the\r\nLongmynd groups of rocks in Shropshire and in Wales appears to be the\r\nimmediate successor to the Upper Laurentian; and it has afforded some\r\nobscure \"worm-burrows\" or, perhaps, casts of sponges or fucoids, with\r\na small shell of the genus _Lingulella_, and also fragments of\r\ncrustaceans (_Palæeopyge_). The \"Fucoid Sandstones\" of Sweden,\r\nbelieved to be of similar age, afford traces of marine plants and\r\nburrows of worms, while the Harlech beds of Wales have afforded to Mr.\r\nHicks a considerable number of fossil animals, not very dissimilar\r\nfrom those of the Upper Cambrian. If these rocks are really the next\r\nin order to the Eozoic, they show a marked advance in life immediately\r\non the commencement of the Primordial period. In Ireland, the curious\r\nOldhamia, noticed below, appears to occur in rocks equally old. As we\r\nascend, however, into the Middle and Upper parts of the Cambrian, the\r\nMenevian and Lingula flag-beds of Britain, and their equivalents in\r\nBohemia and Scandinavia, and the Acadian and Potsdam groups of\r\nAmerica, we find a rich and increasing abundance of animal remains,\r\nconstituting the first Primordial fauna of Barrande.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the Primordial are principally sandy and argillaceous,\r\nforming flags and slates, without thick limestones, and often through\r\ngreat thicknesses, very destitute of organic remains, but presenting\r\nsome layers, especially in their upward extension, crowded with\r\nfossils. These are no longer mere Protozoa, but include\r\nrepresentatives of all the great groups of animals which yet exist,\r\nexcept the vertebrates. We shall not attempt any systematic\r\nclassification of these; but, casting our dredge and tow-net into the\r\nPrimordial sea, examine what we collect, rather in the order of\r\nrelative abundance then of classification.\r\n\r\nOver great breadths of the sea bottom we find vast numbers of little\r\nbivalve shells of the form and size of a finger-nail, fastened by\r\nfleshy peduncles imbedded in the sand or mud; and thus anchored,\r\ncollecting their food by a pair of fringed arms from the minute\r\nanimals and plants which swarm in the surrounding waters. These are\r\nthe _Lingulæ_, from the abundance of which some of the Primordial beds\r\nhave received in England and Wales the name of Lingula flags. In\r\nAmerica, in like manner, in some beds near St. John, New Brunswick,\r\nthe valves of these shells are so abundant as to constitute at least\r\nhalf of the material of the bed; and alike in Europe and America,\r\nLingula and allied forms are among the most abundant Primordial\r\nfossils. The Lingulæ are usually reckoned to belong to the great\r\nsub-kingdom of mollusks, which includes all the bivalve and univalve\r\nshell-fish, and several other groups of creatures; but an able\r\nAmerican naturalist, Mr. Morse, has recently shown that they have many\r\npoints of resemblance to the worms; and thus, perhaps, constitute one\r\nof those curious old-fashioned \"comprehensive\" types, as they have\r\nbeen called, which present resemblances to groups of creatures, in\r\nmore modern times quite distinct from each other. He has also found\r\nthat the modern Lingulæ are very tenacious of life, and capable of\r\nsuiting themselves to different circumstances, a fact which, perhaps,\r\nhas some connection with their long persistence in geological time.\r\nThey are in any case members of the group of lamp-shells, creatures\r\nspecially numerous and important in the earlier geological ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--LIFE IN THE PRIMORDIAL SEA.\r\n\r\nOn the bottom are seen, proceeding from left to right, _Oldhamia\r\nantiqua_, _Lingulæ_, _Arenicolæ_, _Oldhamia radiata_, _Paradoxides_,\r\n_Histioderma_, _Agnostus_, _Oldhamia radiata_, _Algæ_, and _Lingulæ_.\r\nIn the water are _Hymenocaris_, different species of _Trilobites_, and\r\n_Pteropods_.]\r\n\r\nThe Lingulæ are especially interesting as examples of a type of beings\r\ncontinued almost from the dawn of life until now; for their shells, as\r\nthey exist in the Primordial, are scarcely distinguishable from those\r\nof members of the genus which still live. While other tribes of\r\nanimals have run through a great number of different forms, these\r\nlittle creatures remain the same. Another interesting point is a most\r\ncurious chemical relation of the Lingula, with reference to the\r\nmaterial of its shell. The shells of mollusks generally, and even of\r\nthe ordinary lamp-shells, are hardened by common limestone or\r\ncarbonate of lime: the rarer substance, phosphate of lime, is in\r\ngeneral restricted to the formation of the bones of the higher\r\nanimals. In the case of the latter, this relation depends apparently\r\non the fact that the albuminous substances on which animals are\r\nchiefly nourished require for their formation the presence of\r\nphosphates in the plant. Hence the animal naturally obtains phosphate\r\nof lime or bone-earth with its food, and its system is related to this\r\nchemical fact in such wise that phosphate of lime is a most\r\nappropriate and suitable material for its teeth and bones. Now, in the\r\ncase of the lower animals of the sea, their food, not being of the\r\nnature of the richer land plants, but consisting mainly of minute algæ\r\nand of animals which prey on these, furnishes, not phosphate of lime,\r\nbut carbonate. An exception to this occurs in the case of certain\r\nanimals of low grade, sponges, etc., which, feeding on minute plants\r\nwith siliceous cell-walls, assimilate the flinty matter and form a\r\nsiliceous skeleton. But this is an exception of downward tendency, in\r\nwhich these animals approach to plants of low grade. The exception in\r\nthe case of Lingulæ is in the other direction. It gives to these\r\nhumble creatures the same material for their hard parts which is\r\nusually restricted to animals of much higher rank. The purpose of this\r\narrangement, whether in relation to the cause of the deviation from\r\nthe ordinary rule or its utility to the animal itself, remains\r\nunknown. It has, however, been ascertained by Dr. Hunt, who first\r\nobserved the fact in the case of the Primordial Lingulæ, that their\r\nmodern successors coincide with them, and differ from their\r\ncontemporaries among the mollusks in the same particular. This may\r\nseem a trifling matter, but it shows in this early period the\r\norigination of the difference still existing in the materials of which\r\nanimals construct their skeletons, and also the wonderful persistence\r\nof the Lingulæ, through all the geological ages, in the material of\r\ntheir shells. This is the more remarkable, in connection with our own\r\nvery slender acquaintance with the phenomenon, in relation either to\r\nits efficient or final causes.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Lingulæ, I may mention that Mr. Morse informs me\r\nthat living specimens, when detached from their moorings, can creep\r\nlike worms, leaving long furrows on the sand, and that they can also\r\nconstruct sand-tubes wherein to shelter themselves. This shows that\r\nsome of the abundant \"worm burrows\" of the Primordial may have been\r\nthe work of these curious little shell-fishes, as well as, perhaps,\r\nsome of the markings which have been described under the name of\r\n_Eophyton_, and have been supposed, I think incorrectly, to be remains\r\nof land plants.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Lingula we may obtain, though rarely, lamp-shells of\r\nanother type, that of the Orthids, These have the valves hinged along\r\na straight line, in the middle of which is a notch for the peduncle,\r\nand the valves are often marked with ribs or striae. The Orthids were\r\ncontent with limestone for their shells, and apparently lived in the\r\nsame circumstances with the Lingulæ; and in the period succeeding the\r\nPrimordial they became far more abundant. Yet they perished at an\r\nearly stage of the world's progress, and have no representatives in\r\nthe modern seas.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the Primordial ocean the muddy bottom swarmed with\r\ncrustaceans, relatives of our shrimps and lobsters, but of a form\r\nwhich differs so much from these modern shell-fishes that the\r\nquestion of their affinities has long been an unsettled one with\r\nzoologists. Hundreds of species are known, some almost microscopic in\r\nsize, others a foot in length. All are provided with a broad flat\r\nhorseshoe-shaped head-plate, which, judging from its form and a\r\ncomparison with the modern king-crabs or horseshoe-crabs, must have\r\nbeen intended as a sort of mud-plough to enable them to excavate\r\nburrows or hide themselves in the slimy ooze of the ocean bed. On the\r\nsides of this buckler are placed the prominent eyes, furnished with\r\nmany separate lenses, on precisely the same plan with those of modern\r\ncrustaceans and insects, and testifying, as Buckland long ago pointed\r\nout, to the identity of the action of light in the ancient and the\r\nmodern seas. The body was composed of numerous segments, each divided\r\ntransversely into three lobes, whence they have received the name of\r\n_Trilobites_, and the whole articulated, so that the creature could\r\nroll itself into a ball, like the modern slaters or wood-lice, which\r\nare not very distant relatives of these old crustaceans.[F] The limbs\r\nof Trilobites were long unknown, and it was even doubted whether they\r\nhad any; but recent discoveries have shown that they had a series of\r\nflat limbs useful both for swimming and creeping. The Trilobites,\r\nunder many specific and generic forms, range from the Primordial to\r\nthe Carboniferous rocks, but are altogether wanting in the more recent\r\nformations and in the modern seas. The Trilobites lived on muddy\r\nbottoms, and their remains are extremely abundant in shaly and slaty\r\nbeds, though found also in limestone and sandstone. In the latter they\r\nhave left most curious traces of their presence in the trails which\r\nthey have produced. Some of the most ancient sandstones have their\r\nsurfaces covered with rows of punctured impressions (_Protichnites_,\r\nfirst footprints), others have strange series of transverse grooves\r\nwith longitudinal ones at the side (_Climactichnites_, ladder\r\nfootprints); others are oval burrows, marked with transverse lines and\r\na ridge along the middle (_Rusichnites_, wrinkle footprints). All of\r\nthese so nearly resemble the trails and tracks of modern king-crabs\r\nthat there can be little doubt as to their origin. Many curious\r\nstriated grooves and bifid marks, found on the surfaces of Primordial\r\nbeds, and which have been described as plants, are probably only the\r\nmarks of the oral organs or feet of these and similar creatures, which\r\npassed their lives in grubbing for food in the soft, slimy ooze,\r\nthough they could, no doubt, like the modern king-crabs, swim when\r\nnecessary. Some still more shrimp-like creatures, Hymenocaris, which\r\nare found with them, certainly had this power.\r\n\r\n[F] Woodward has recently suggested affinities of Trilobites with the\r\nIsopods or equal-footed crustaceans, on the evidence of a remarkable\r\nspecimen with remains of feet described by Billings.\r\n\r\nA lower type of annulose or ringed animal then that of the Trilobites,\r\nis that of the worms. These creatures cannot be preserved in a fossil\r\nstate, except in the case of those which inhabit calcareous tubes:\r\nbut the marks which their jointed bodies and numerous side-bristles\r\nleave on the sand and mud may, when buried under succeeding sediments,\r\nremain; and extensive surfaces of very old rocks are marked in this\r\nway, either with cylindrical burrows or curious trails with side\r\nscratches looking like pinnate leaves. These constitute the genus\r\n_Crusiana_, while others of more ordinary form belong to the genus\r\n_Arenicolites_, so named from the common Arenicola, or lobworm, whose\r\nburrows they are supposed to resemble. Markings referable to seaweed\r\nalso occur in the Primordial rocks, and also some grotesque and almost\r\ninexplicable organisms known as _Oldhamia_, which have been chiefly\r\nfound in the Primordial of Ireland. One of the most common forms\r\nconsists of a series of apparently jointed threads disposed in\r\nfan-like clusters on a central stem (_Oldhamia antiqua_). Another has\r\na wider and simpler fan-like arrangement of filaments. These have been\r\nclaimed by botanists as algæ, and have been regarded by zoologists as\r\nminute Zoophytes, while some more sceptical have supposed that they\r\nmay be mere inorganic wrinklings of the beds. This last view does not,\r\nhowever, seem tenable. They are, perhaps, the predecessors of the\r\ncurious _Graptolites_, which we shall have to represent in the\r\nSilurian.\r\n\r\nSingularly enough, Foraminifera, the characteristic fossils of the\r\nLaurentian, have been little recognised in the Primordial, nor are\r\nthere any limestones known so massive as those of the former series.\r\nThere are, however, a number of remarkable organisms, which have\r\nusually been described as sponges, but are more probably partly of the\r\nnature of sponges and partly of that of Foraminifera. Of this kind are\r\nsome of the singular conical fossils described by Billings as\r\n_Archæocyathus_, and found in the Primordial limestone of Labrador.\r\nThey are hollow within, with radiating pores and plates, calcareous in\r\nsome, and in others with siliceous spicules like those of modern\r\nsponges. Some of them are several inches in diameter, and they must\r\nhave grown rooted in muddy bottoms, in the manner of some of the\r\ndeep-sea sponges of modern times. One species at least of these\r\ncreatures was a true Foraminifer, allied, though somewhat distantly,\r\nto Eozoon. In some parts of the Primordial sandstones, curious\r\nfunnel-shaped casts in sand occur, sometimes marked with spiral lines.\r\nThe name _Histioderma_ has been given to some of these, and they have\r\nbeen regarded as mouths of worm-burrows. Others of larger size have\r\nbeen compared to inverted stumps of trees. If they were produced by\r\nworms, some of these must have been of gigantic size, but Billings has\r\nrecently suggested that they may be casts of sponges that lived like\r\nsome modern species imbedded in the sand. In accordance with this view\r\nI have represented these curious objects in the engraving, On the\r\nwhole, the life of these oldest Palæozoic rocks is not very abundant;\r\nbut there are probably representatives of three of the great\r\nsubdivisions of animals or, as some would reckon them, of four the\r\nProtozoa, the Radiata (Coelenterata), the Mollusca, and the Annulosa.\r\nAnd it is most interesting thus to find in these very old rocks the\r\nmodern subdivisions of animals already represented, and these by types\r\nsome of them nearly allied to existing inhabitants of the seas I have\r\nendeavoured in the engraving to represent some of the leading forms of\r\nmarine life in this ancient period.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most interesting discoveries in these rocks is that\r\nof rain-marks and shrinkage-cracks, in some of the very oldest\r\nbeds--those of the Longmynd in Shropshire. On the modern muddy beach\r\nany ordinary observer is familiar with the cracks produced by the\r\naction of the sun and air on the dried surfaces left by the tides.\r\nSuch cracks, covered by the waters of a succeeding tide, may be buried\r\nin newer silt, and once preserved in this way are imperishable. In\r\nlike manner, the pits left by passing showers of rain on the mud\r\nrecently left bare by the tide may, when the mud has dried, become\r\nsufficiently firm to be preserved. In this way we have rain-marks of\r\nvarious geological ages; but the oldest known are those of the\r\nLongmynd, where they are associated both with ripple-marks and\r\nshrinkage-cracks. We thus have evidence of the action of tides, of\r\nsun, and of rain, in these ancient periods just as in the present day.\r\nWere there no land animals to prowl along the low tidal flats in\r\nsearch of food? Were there no herbs or trees to drink in the rains and\r\nflourish in the sunshine? If there were, no bone or footprint on the\r\nshore, or drifted leaf or branch, has yet revealed their existence to\r\nthe eyes of geologists The beds of the Primordial age exist in\r\nEngland, in Bohemia, in Sweden and Norway, and also in North America.\r\nThey appear to have been deposited along the shores of the old\r\nLaurentian continent, and probably some of them indicate very deep\r\nwater. The Primordial rocks are in many parts of the world altered and\r\nhardened. They have often assumed a slaty structure, and their\r\nbedding, and the fossils which they contain, are both affected by\r\nthis. The usual view entertained as to what is called slaty structure\r\nis, that it depends on pressure, acting on more or less compressible\r\nmaterial in some direction usually different from that of the bedding.\r\nSuch pressure has the effect of arranging all the flat particles as\r\nscales of mica, etc. in planes parallel to the compressing surface.\r\nHence, if much material of this kind is present in the sediment, the\r\nwhole rock assumes a fissile character causing it to split readily\r\ninto thin plates. That such yielding to pressure has actually taken\r\nplace is seen very distinctly in microscopic sections of some slaty\r\nrocks, which often show not only a laminated structure, but an actual\r\ncrumpling on a small scale, causing them to assume almost the aspect\r\nof woody fibre. Such rocks often remind a casual observer of decaying\r\ntrunks of trees, and sections of them under the microscope show the\r\nmost minute and delicate crumpling. It is also proved by the condition\r\nof the fossils the beds contain. These are often distorted, so that\r\nsome of them are lengthened and others shortened, and if specimens\r\nwere selected with, that view, it would be quite easy to suppose that\r\nthose lengthened by distortion are of different species from those\r\ndistorted so as to be shortened. Slaty cleavage and distortion are\r\nnot, however, confined to Primordial rocks, but occur in altered\r\nsediments of various ages.\r\n\r\nThe Primordial sediments must have at one time been very widely\r\ndistributed, and must have filled up many of the inequalities produced\r\nby the rending and contortion of the Laurentian beds. Their thicker\r\nand more massive portions are, however, necessarily along the borders\r\nof the Laurentian continents, and as they in their turn were raised up\r\ninto land, they became exposed to the denuding action first of the\r\nsea, and afterwards of the rain and rivers, and were so extensively\r\nwasted away that only in a few regions do large areas of them remain\r\nvisible. That of Bohemia has afforded to Barrande a great number of\r\nmost interesting fossils. The rocks of St. David's in Wales, those of\r\nShropshire in England, and those of Wicklow in Ireland are also of\r\ngreat interest; and next to these in importance are, perhaps, the\r\nHuronian and Acadian groups of North America, in which continent--as\r\nfor example in Nova Scotia and in some parts of New England--there are\r\nextensive areas of old metamorphic rocks whose age has not been\r\ndetermined by fossils, but which may belong to this period.\r\n\r\nThe question of division lines of formations is one much agitated in\r\nthe case of the Cambrian rocks. Whether certain beds are to be called\r\nCambrian or Silurian has been a point greatly controverted; and the\r\nterms Primordial and Primordial Silurian have been used as means to\r\navoid the raising of this difficulty. Many of our division lines in\r\ngeology are arbitrary and conventional, and this may be the case with\r\nthat between the Primordial and Silurian, the one age graduating into\r\nthe other. There appears to be, however, the best reason to recognise\r\na distinct Cambrian period, preceding the two great periods, those of\r\nthe second and third faunas of Barrande, to which the term Silurian is\r\nusually applied. On the other hand, in so far as our knowledge extends\r\nat present, a strongly marked line of separation exists between the\r\nLaurentian and Primordial, the latter resting on the edges of the\r\nformer, which seems then to have been as much altered as now. Still a\r\nbreak of this kind may be, perhaps must be, merely local; and may vary\r\nin amount. Thus, in some places we find rocks of Silurian and later\r\nages resting directly on the Laurentian, without the intervention of\r\nthe Primordial. In any case, where a line of coast is steadily\r\nsinking, each succeeding deposit will overlap that which went before;\r\nand this seems to have been the case with the Laurentian shore when\r\nthe Primordial and Silurian were being deposited. Hence over large\r\nspaces the Primordial is absent, being probably buried up, except\r\nwhere exposed by denudation at the margin of the two formations.\r\n\r\nThis occurs in several parts of Canada, while the Laurentian rocks\r\nhave evidently been subjected to metamorphism and long-continued\r\nweathering before the Lower Silurian were deposited; and in some\r\ncases the latter rest on weather-worn and pitted surfaces, and are\r\nfilled with angular bits of the underlying rock, as well as with\r\ndrift-shells which have been cast on these old Laurentian shores;\r\nwhile in other cases the Silurian rests on smooth water-worn\r\nLaurentian rocks, and is filled at the junction with well-rounded\r\npebbles and grains of sand which have evidently been subjected to a\r\nmore thorough attrition then those of the present beach. With respect\r\nto the line of division between the Primordial and the next succeeding\r\nrocks, it will be seen that important movements of the continents\r\noccurred at the close of the Cambrian, and in some places the Cambrian\r\nrocks have been much disturbed before the deposition of the Lower\r\nSilurian.\r\n\r\nSeated on some ancient promontory of the Laurentian, and looking over\r\nthe plain which, in the Primordial and Lower Silurian periods was the\r\nsea, I have often wished for some shred of vegetable matter to tell\r\nwhat lived on that land when the Primordial surf beat upon its shore,\r\nand washed up the Trilobites and Brachiopods of those old seas; but no\r\nrock has yet taken up its parable to reveal the secret, and the\r\nPrimordial is vocal only with the old story: \"And God said, Let the\r\nwaters swarm with swarming living things, and it was so.\" So our\r\npicture of the period may represent a sea-bottom swarming with animals\r\nof low grade, some sessile, some locomotive; and we may merely suppose\r\na distant shore with vegetation dimly seen, and active volcanoes; but\r\na shore on which no foot of naturalist has yet trod to scan its\r\nproductions. Very different estimates have been formed of the amount\r\nof life in this period, according to the position given to its latest\r\nlimit. Taking some of the more modern views of this subject, we might\r\nhave included among the Primordial animals many additional creatures,\r\nwhich we prefer noticing in the Silurian, since it may at least be\r\naffirmed that their head-quarters were in that age, even if they had a\r\nbeginning in the Primordial. It may be interesting here, however, to\r\nnote the actual amount of life known to us in this period, taken in\r\nits largest scope. In doing this, I shall take advantage of an\r\ninteresting table given by Dr. Bigsby,[G] and representing the state\r\nof knowledge in 1868, and shall group the species in such a manner as\r\nto indicate the relative abundance of distinct types of structure. We\r\nfind then--\r\n\r\n  Plants (all, or nearly all, supposed to be\r\n    sea-weeds, and some, probably, mere tracks\r\n    or trails of animals)                         22 species.\r\n\r\n  Sponges, and similar creatures                  27    \"\r\n\r\n  Corals and their allies                          6    \"\r\n\r\n  Starfishes and their allies                      4    \"\r\n\r\n  Worms                                           29    \"\r\n\r\n  Trilobites and other crustaceans               442    \"\r\n\r\n  Lamp-shells and other molluscoids              193    \"\r\n\r\n  Common bivalve mollusks                         12    \"\r\n\r\n  Common univalve mollusks and their allies      172    \"\r\n\r\n  Higher mollusks, nautili, cuttle-fishes, etc.   65    \"\r\n                                                 ---\r\n                   In all                        972    \"\r\n\r\n[G] \"Thesaurus Siluricus.\"\r\n\r\nNow in this enumeration we observe, in the first place, a\r\nrepresentation of all the lower or invertebrate groups of the waters.\r\nWe have next the remarkable fact that the Radiata of Cuvier, the\r\nlowest and most plant-like of the marine animals, are comparatively\r\nslenderly represented, yet that there are examples of their higher as\r\nwell as of their lower forms. We have the further fact that the\r\ncrustaceans, the highest marine animals of the annulose type, are\r\npredominant in the waters; and that in the mollusks the highest and\r\nlowest groups are most plentiful, the middle less so. The whole number\r\nof species is small, and this may arise either from our having here\r\nreached an early period in the history of life, or from our\r\ninformation being defective. Both are probably true. Still, of the\r\nanimals known, we cannot say that the proportions of the different\r\nkinds depend on defective knowledge. There is no reason, for example,\r\nwhy corals should not have been preserved as well as Trilobites, or\r\nwhy Brachiopods should have been preserved rather then ordinary\r\nbivalves. The proportions, therefore, it may be more safe to reason\r\nfrom then the aggregate. In looking at these proportions, and\r\ncomparing them with those of modern seas, we are struck with the great\r\nnumber of species representing some types either now extinct or\r\ncomparatively rare: the Trilobites and Brachiopods more particularly.\r\nWe are astonished at the enormous preponderance of these two groups,\r\nand especially of the Trilobites. Further, we observe that while some\r\nforms, like Lingula and Nautilus, have persisted down to modern\r\ntimes, others, like the Trilobites and Orthids, perished very early.\r\nIn all this we can dimly perceive a fitness of living things to\r\nphysical conditions, a tendency to utilise each type to the limit of\r\nits capacities for modification, and then to abandon it for something\r\nhigher; a tendency of low types to appear first, but to appear in\r\ntheir highest perfection and variety; a sudden apparition of totally\r\ndiverse plans of structure subserving similar ends simultaneously with\r\neach other, as for instance those of the Mollusk and the Crustacean;\r\nthe appearance of optical and mechanical contrivances, as for example\r\nthe compound eyes of the Trilobite and the swimming float of the\r\nOrthoceras, in all their perfection at first, just as they continue to\r\nthis day in creatures of similar grade. That these and other similar\r\nthings point to a uniform and far-reaching plan, no rational mind can\r\ndoubt; and if the world had stopped short in the Primordial period,\r\nand attained to no further development, this would have been\r\nabundantly apparent; though it shines forth more and more\r\nconspicuously in each succeeding page of the stony record. How far\r\nsuch unity and diversity can be explained by the modern philosophy of\r\na necessary and material evolution out of mere death and physical\r\nforces, and how far it requires the intervention of a Creative mind,\r\nare questions which we may well leave with the thoughtful reader, till\r\nwe have traced this history somewhat further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE LOWER AND UPPER SILURIAN AGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy English geologists, the great series of formations which succeeds\r\nto the Cambrian is usually included under the name Silurian System,\r\nfirst proposed by Sir Roderick Murchison. It certainly, however,\r\nconsists of two distinct groups, holding the second and third faunas\r\nof Barrande. The older of the two, usually called the Lower Silurian,\r\nis the Upper Cambrian of Sedgwick, and may properly be called the\r\n_Siluro-Cambrian_. The newer is the true Silurian, or Silurian\r\nproper--the Upper Silurian of Murchison. We shall in this chapter, for\r\nconvenience, consider both in connection, using occasionally the term\r\nLower Silurian as equivalent to Siluro-Cambrian. The Silurian presents\r\nus with a definite physical geography, for the northern hemisphere at\r\nleast; and this physical geography is a key to the life conditions of\r\nthe time. The North American continent, from its great unbroken area,\r\naffords, as usual, the best means of appreciating this. In this period\r\nthe northern currents, acting perhaps in harmony with old Laurentian\r\noutcrops, had deposited in the sea two long submarine ridges, running\r\nto the southward from the extreme ends of the Laurentian nucleus, and\r\nconstituting the foundations of the present ridges of the Rocky\r\nMountains and the Alleghanies. Between these the extensive triangular\r\narea now constituting the greater part of North America, was a shallow\r\noceanic plateau, sheltered from the cold polar currents by the\r\nLaurentian land on the north, and separated by the ridges already\r\nmentioned from the Atlantic and Pacific. It was on this great plateau\r\nof warm and sheltered ocean that what we call the Silurian fauna\r\nlived; while of the creatures that inhabited the depths of the great\r\nbounding oceans, whose abysses must have been far deeper and at a much\r\nlower temperature, we know little. During the long Silurian periods,\r\nit is true, the great American plateau underwent many revolutions,\r\nsometimes being more deeply submerged, and having clear water tenanted\r\nby vast numbers of corals and shell-fishes, at others rising so as to\r\nbecome shallow and to receive deposits of sand and mud; but it was\r\nalways distinct from the oceanic area without. In Europe, in like\r\nmanner, there seems to have been a great internal plateau bounded by\r\nthe embryo hills of Western Europe on the west, and harbouring a very\r\nsimilar assemblage of creatures to those existing in America.\r\n\r\nFurther, during these long periods there were great changes, from a\r\nfauna of somewhat primordial type up to a new order of things in the\r\nUpper Silurian, tending toward the novelties which were introduced in\r\nthe succeeding Devonian and Carboniferous. We may, in the first place,\r\nsketch these changes as they occurred on the two great continental\r\nplateaus, noting as we proceed such hints as can be obtained with\r\nreference to the more extensive oceanic spaces.\r\n\r\nBefore the beginning of the age, both plateaus seem to have been\r\ninvaded by sandy and muddy sediments charged at some periods and\r\nplaces with magnesian limestone; and these circumstances were not\r\nfavourable to the existence or preservation of organic remains. Such\r\nare the Potsdam and Calciferous beds of America and the Tremadoc and\r\nLlandeilo beds of England. The Potsdam and Tremadoc are by their\r\nfossils included in the Cambrian, and may at least be regarded as\r\ntransition groups. It is further to be observed, in the case of these\r\nbeds, that if we begin at the west side of Europe and proceed\r\neasterly, or at the east side of America and proceed westerly, they\r\nbecome progressively thinner, the greater amount of material being\r\ndeposited at the edges of the future continents; just as on the sides\r\nof a muddy tideway the flats are higher, and the more coarse sediment\r\ndeposited near the margin of the channel, and fine mud is deposited at\r\na greater distance and in thinner beds. The cause, however, on the\r\ngreat scale of the Atlantic, was somewhat different, ancient ridges\r\ndetermining the border of the channel. This statement holds good not\r\nonly of these older beds, but of the whole of the Silurian, and of the\r\nsucceeding Devonian and Carboniferous, all deposited on these same\r\nplateaus. Thus, in the case of the Silurian in England and Wales, the\r\nwhole series is more then 20,000 feet thick, but in Russia, it is\r\nless then 1,000 feet. In the eastern part of America the thickness is\r\nestimated at quite as great an amount as in Europe, while in the\r\nregion of the Mississippi the Silurian rocks are scarcely thicker then\r\nin Russia, and consist in great part of limestones and fine sediments,\r\nthe sandstones and conglomerates thinning out rapidly eastward of the\r\nAppalachian Mountains.\r\n\r\nIn both plateaus the earlier period of coarse accumulations was\r\nsucceeded by one in which was clear water depositing little earthy\r\nsediment, and this usually fine; and in which the sea swarmed with\r\nanimal life, from the _débris_ of which enormous beds of limestone\r\nwere formed the Trenton limestone of America and the Bala limestone of\r\nEurope. The fossils of this part of the series open up to us the\r\nhead-quarters of Lower Silurian life, the second great fauna of\r\nBarrande, that of the Upper Cambrian of Sedgwick; and in America more\r\nespecially, the Trenton and its associated limestones can be traced\r\nover forty degrees of longitude; and throughout the whole of this\r\nspace its principal beds are composed entirely of comminuted corals,\r\nshells, and crinoids, and studded with organisms of the same kinds\r\nstill retaining their forms. Out of these seas, in the European area,\r\narose in places volcanic islets, like those of the modern Pacific.\r\n\r\nIn the next succeeding era the clear waters became again invaded with\r\nmuddy and sandy sediments, in various alternations, and with\r\noccasional bands of limestone, constituting the Caradoc beds of\r\nBritain and the Utica and Hudson River groups of America. During the\r\ndeposition of these, the abounding life of the Siluro-Cambrian\r\nplateaus died away, and a middle group of sandstones and shales, the\r\nOneida and Medina of America and the Mayhill of England, form the base\r\nof the Upper Silurian.\r\n\r\nBut what was taking place meanwhile in the oceanic areas separating\r\nour plateaus? These were identical with the basins of the Atlantic and\r\nPacific, which already existed in this period as depressions of the\r\nearth's crust, perhaps not so deep as at present. As to the deposits\r\nin their deeper portions we know nothing; but on the margin of the\r\nAtlantic area are some rocks which give us at least a little\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nIn the later part of the Cambrian period the enormous thickness of the\r\nQuebec group of North America appears to represent a broad stripe of\r\ndeep water parallel to the eastern edge of the American plateau, and\r\nin which an immense thickness of beds of sand and mud was deposited\r\nwith very few fossils, except in particular beds, and these of a more\r\nprimordial aspect then those of the plateau itself. These rocks no\r\ndoubt represent the margin of a deep Atlantic area, over which cold\r\ncurrents destructive of life were constantly passing, and in which\r\ngreat quantities of sand and mud, swept from the icy regions of the\r\nNorth, were continually being laid. The researches of Dr. Carpenter\r\nand Dr. Wyville Thomson show us that there are at present cold areas\r\nin the deeper parts of the Atlantic, on the European side, as we have\r\nlong known that they exist at less depths on the American side; and\r\nthese same researches, with the soundings on the American banks, show\r\nthat sand and gravel may be deposited not merely on shallows, but in\r\nthe depths of the ocean, provided that these depths are pervaded by\r\ncold and heavy currents capable of eroding the bottom, and of moving\r\ncoarse material. The Quebec group in Canada and the United States, and\r\nthe metalliferous Lower Silurian rocks of Nova Scotia and\r\nNewfoundland, destitute of great marine limestones and coral reefs,\r\nevidently represent deep and cold-water areas on the border of the\r\nAtlantic plateau.\r\n\r\nAt a later period, the beginning of the Upper Silurian, the richly\r\nfossiliferous and exceptional deposits of the Island of Anticosti,\r\nformed in the deep hollow of the Gulf of St. Laurence, show that when\r\nthe plateau had become shallowed up by deposition and elevation, and\r\nconverted into desolate sand-banks, the area of abundant life was\r\ntransferred to the still deep Atlantic basin and its bordering bays,\r\nin which the forms of Lower Silurian life continued to exist until\r\nthey were mixed up with those of the Upper Silurian.\r\n\r\nIf we turn now to these latter rocks, and inquire as to their\r\nconditions on our two great plateaus, we shall find a repetition of\r\nchanges similar to those which occurred in the times preceding. The\r\nsandy shallows of the earlier part of this period give place to wide\r\noceanic areas similar to those of the Lower Silurian; In these we find\r\nvast and thick coral and shell limestones, the Wenlock of England and\r\nNiagara of America, as rich in life as the limestones of the Lower\r\nSilurian, and with the generic and family forms similar, but the\r\nspecies for the most part different. In America these limestones were\r\nfollowed by a singularly shallow condition of the plateau, in which\r\nthe surface was so raised as at times to be converted into separate\r\nsalt lakes in which beds of salt were deposited. On both plateaus\r\nthere were alternations of oceanic and shallow conditions, under which\r\nthe Lower Helderberg and Ludlow beds, the closing members of the\r\nSilurian, were laid down. Of the Atlantic beds of this period we know\r\nlittle, except that the great limestones appear to be wanting, and to\r\nbe replaced by sandy and muddy deposits, in some parts at least of the\r\nmargins of the area. In some portions also of the plateaus and their\r\nmargins, extensive volcanic outbursts seem to have occurred; so that\r\nthe American plateau presented, at least in parts, the aspect of a\r\ncoral sea with archipelagos of volcanic islands, the ejections from\r\nwhich became mixed with the aqueous deposits forming around them.\r\n\r\nHaving thus traced the interesting series of geographical conditions\r\nindicated by the Silurian series, we may next take our station on one\r\nof the submerged plateaus, and inquire as to the new forms of life now\r\nintroduced to our notice; and in doing so shall include the life of\r\nboth the Lower and Upper Silurian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Fragment of Lower Silurian Limestone, sliced\r\nand magnified ten diameters, showing the manner in which it is made up\r\nof fragments of corals, crinoids, and shells. (From a paper oil the\r\nMicroscopic Structure of Canadian limestone, \"Canadian Naturalist.\")]\r\n\r\nFirst, we may remark the vast abundance and variety of corals. The\r\npolyps, close relatives of the common sea-anemone of our coasts, which\r\nbuild up our modern coral reefs, were represented in the Silurian seas\r\nby a great number of allied yet different forms, equally effectual in\r\nthe great work of secreting carbonate of lime in stony masses, and\r\ntherefore in the building-up of continents. Let us note some of the\r\ndifferences. In the first place, whereas our modern coral-workers can\r\nshow us but the topmost pinnacles of their creations, peeping above\r\nthe surface of the sea in coral reefs and islands, the work of the\r\ncoral animals of the Silurian has been finished, by these limestones\r\nbeing covered with masses of new sediment consolidated into hard rock,\r\nand raised out of the sea to constitute a part of the dry land. In\r\nthe Silurian limestones we thus have, not merely the coral reefs, but\r\nthe wide beds of comminuted coral, mixed with the remains of other\r\nanimals, which are necessarily accumulated in the ocean bed around the\r\nreefs and islands. Further, these beds, which we might find loose and\r\nunconsolidated in the modern sea, have their fragments closely\r\ncemented together in the old limestones. The nature of this difference\r\ncan be well seen by comparing a fragment of modern coral or shell\r\nlimestone from Bermuda, with a similar fragment of the Trenton\r\nlimestone, both being sliced for examination under the microscope. The\r\nold limestone is black or greyish, the modern one is nearly white,\r\nbecause in the former the organic matter in the animal fragments has\r\nbeen carbonised or converted into coaly and bituminous matter. The old\r\nlimestone is much more dense and compact, partly because its materials\r\nhave been more closely compressed by superincumbent weight, but\r\nchiefly because calcareous matter in solution in water has penetrated\r\nall the interstices, and filled them up with a deposit of crystalline\r\nlimestone. In examining a slice, however, under the microscope, it\r\nwill be seen that the fragments of corals and other organisms are as\r\ndistinct and well preserved as in the crumbling modern rock, except\r\nthat they are perfectly imbedded in a paste of clear transparent\r\nlimestone, or rather calcareous spar, infiltrated between them. I have\r\nexamined great numbers of slices of these limestones, ever with new\r\nwonder at the packing of the organic fragments which they present. The\r\nhard marble-like limestones used for building in the Silurian\r\ndistricts of Europe and America, are thus in most cases consolidated\r\nmasses of organic fragments.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the animals themselves must have differed somewhat\r\nfrom their modern successors. This we gather from the structure of\r\ntheir stony cells, which present points of difference indicating\r\ncorresponding difference of detail in the soft parts. Zoologists thus\r\nseparate the rugose or wrinkled corals and the tabulate or floored\r\ncorals of the Silurian from those of the modern seas. The former must\r\nhave been more like the ordinary coral animals; the latter were very\r\npeculiar, more especially in the close union of the cells, and in the\r\ntransverse floors which they were in the habit of building across\r\nthese cells as they grew in height. They presented, however, all the\r\nforms of our modern corals. Some were rounded and massive in form,\r\nothers delicate and branching. Some were solitary or detached, others\r\naggregative in communities. Some had the individual animals large and\r\nprobably showy, others had them of microscopic size. Perhaps the most\r\nremarkable of all is the American _Beatricea_,[H] which grew like a\r\ngreat trunk of a tree twenty feet or more in height, its solitary\r\nanimal at the top like a pillar-saint, though no doubt more\r\nappropriate and comfortable; and multitudes of delicate and encrusting\r\ncorals clinging like mosses or lichens to its sides. This creature\r\nbelongs to the very middle of the Silurian, and must have lived in\r\ngreat depths, undisturbed by swell or breakers, and sheltering vast\r\nmultitudes of other creatures in its stony colonnades.\r\n\r\n[H] First described by Mr. Billings. It has been regarded as a plant,\r\nand as a cephalopod shell; but I believe it was a coral allied to\r\n_Cystiphyllum_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--LIFE IN THE SILURIAN AGE.\r\n\r\nOn the bottom are seen, proceeding from left to right, Corals\r\n(_Stenopora_ and _Beatricea_) and a Gasteropod; _Orthoceras_; Coral\r\n(_Patria_); Crinoids, _Lingulæ_, and Cystideans; a _Trilobite_ and\r\n_Cyrtolites_.

Further on, are Cephalopods, a Heteropod, and Fishes.\r\nAt the surface, _Phyllograptus_, _Graptolithus_, and _Bellerophon_.\r\nOn the Land, _Lepidodendron_, _Psilophyton_, and _Prototaxites_.]\r\n\r\nLastly, the Silurian corals nourished in latitudes more boreal then\r\ntheir modern representatives. In both hemispheres as far north as\r\nSilurian limestones have been traced, well-developed corals have been\r\nfound. On the great plateaus sheltered by Laurentian ridges to the\r\nnorth, and exposed to the sun and to the warmer currents of the\r\nequatorial regions, they nourished most grandly and luxuriantly: but\r\nthey lived also north of the Laurentian bands in the Arctic Sea\r\nbasins, though probably in the shallower and more sheltered parts.\r\nUndoubtedly the geographical arrangements of the Silurian period\r\ncontributed to this. We have already seen how peculiarly adapted to an\r\nexuberant marine life were the submerged continents of the period; and\r\nthere was probably little Arctic land producing icebergs to chill the\r\nseas. The great Arctic currents, which then as now flowed powerfully\r\ntoward the equator, must have clung to the deeper parts of the ocean\r\nbasins, while the return waters from the equator would spread\r\nthemselves widely over the surface; so that wherever the Arctic Seas\r\npresented areas a little elevated out of the cold water bottom, there\r\nmight be suitable abodes for coral animals. It has been supposed that\r\nin the Silurian period the sea might have derived some appreciable\r\nheat from the crust of the earth below, and astronomical conditions\r\nhave been suggested as tending to produce changes of climate; but it\r\nis evident that whatever weight may be due to these causes, the\r\nobserved geographical conditions are sufficient to account for the\r\nfacts of the case. It is also to be observed, that we cannot safely\r\ninfer the requirements as to temperature of Silurian coral animals\r\nfrom those of the tenants of the modern ocean. In the modern seas many\r\nforms of life thrive best and grow to the greatest size in the colder\r\nseas; and in the later tertiary period there were elephants and\r\nrhinoceroses sufficiently hardy to endure the rigours of an Arctic\r\nclimate. So there may have been in the Silurian seas corals of much\r\nless delicate constitution then those now living.\r\n\r\nNext to the corals we may place the crinoids, or\r\nstone-lilies--creatures abounding throughout the Silurian seas, and\r\nrealizing a new creative idea, to be expanded in subsequent geological\r\ntime into all the multifarious types of star-fishes and sea-urchins. A\r\ntypical crinoid, such as the _Glyptocrinus_ of the Lower Silurian,\r\nconsists of a flexible jointed stem, sometimes several feet in length,\r\ncomposed of short cylindrical discs, curiously articulated together, a\r\nbox-like body on top made up of polygonal pieces attached to each\r\nother at the edges, and five radiating jointed arms furnished with\r\nbranches and branchlets, or fringes, all articulated and capable of\r\nbeing flexed in any direction. Such a creature has more the aspect of\r\na flower then of an animal; yet it is really an animal, and subsists\r\nby collecting with its arms and drifting into its mouth minute\r\ncreatures floating in the water. Another group, less typical, but\r\nabundantly represented in the Silurian seas, is that of the\r\nCystideans, in which the body is sack-like, and the arms few and\r\nsometimes attached to the body. They resemble the young or larvæ of\r\ncrinoids. In the modern seas the crinoids are extremely few, though\r\ndredging in very deep water has recently added to the number of known\r\nspecies; but in the Silurian period they had their birth, and attained\r\nto a number and perfection not afterwards surpassed. Perhaps the\r\nstone-lilies of the Upper Silurian rocks of Dudley, in England, are\r\nthe most beautiful of Palæozoic animals. Judging from the immense\r\nquantities of their remains in some limestones, wide areas of the sea\r\nbottom must have been crowded with their long stalks and flower-like\r\nbodies, presenting vast submarine fields of these stony water-lilies.\r\n\r\nPassing over many tribes of mollusks, continued or extended from the\r\nPrimordial--and merely remarking that the lamp-shells and the ordinary\r\nbivalve and univalve shell-fishes are all represented largely, more\r\nespecially the former group, in the Silurian--we come to the highest\r\nof the Mollusca, represented in our seas by the cuttle-fishes and\r\nnautili, creatures which, like the crinoids, may be said to have had\r\ntheir birth in the Silurian, and to have there attained to some of\r\ntheir grandest forms. The modern pearly nautilus shell, well known in\r\nevery museum, is beautifully coiled in a disc-like form, and when\r\nsliced longitudinally shows a series of partitions dividing it into\r\nchambers, air-tight, and serving as a float to render the body of the\r\ncreature independent of the force of gravity. As the animal grows it\r\nretracts its body toward the front of the shell, and forms new\r\npartitions, so that the buoyancy of the float always corresponds with\r\nthe weight of the animal; while by the expansion and contraction of\r\nthe body and removal of water from a tube or syphon which traverses\r\nthe chambers, or the injection of additional water, slight differences\r\ncan be effected, rendering the creature a very little lighter or\r\nheavier then the medium in which it swims. Thus practically delivered\r\nfrom the encumbrance of weight, and furnished with long flexible arms\r\nprovided with suckers, with great eyes and a horny beak, the nautilus\r\nbecomes one of the tyrants of the deep, creeping on the bottom or\r\nswimming on the surface at will, and everywhere preying on whatever\r\nanimals it can master. Fortunately for us, as well as for the more\r\nfeeble inhabitants of the sea, the nautili are not of great size,\r\nthough some of their allies, the cuttle-fishes, which, however,\r\nwant the floating apparatus, are sufficiently powerful to be\r\nformidable to man. In the Silurian period, however, there were\r\nnot only nautili like ours, but a peculiar kind of straight\r\nnautilus--the _Orthoceratites_--which sometimes attained to gigantic\r\nsize. The shells of these creatures may be compared to those of nautili\r\nstraightened out, the chambers being placed in a direct line in front\r\nof each other. A great number of species have been discovered, many\r\nquite insignificant in size, but others as much as twelve feet in\r\nlength and a foot in diameter at the larger end. Indeed, accounts have\r\nbeen given of individuals of much larger growth. These large\r\n_Orthoceratites_ were the most powerful marine animals known to us in\r\nthe Silurian, and must have been in those days the tyrants of the\r\nseas.[I]\r\n\r\n[I] Zoologists will observe that I have, in the illustrations given\r\nthe Orthoceras the arms rather of a cuttle-fish then of a nautilus.\r\nThe form of the outer chamber of the shell, I think, warrants this\r\nview of the structure of the animal, which must have been formed on a\r\nvery comprehensive type.\r\n\r\nAmong the crustaceans, or soft shell-fishes of the Silurian, we meet\r\nwith the _Trilobites_, continued from the Primordial in great and\r\nincreasing force, and represented by many and beautiful species; while\r\nan allied group of shell-fishes of low organization but gigantic size,\r\nthe _Eurypterids_, characteristic of the Upper Silurian, were provided\r\nwith powerful limbs, long flexible bodies, and great eyes in the front\r\nof the head, and were sometimes several feet in length. Instead of\r\nbeing mud grovellers, like the Trilobites and modern king-crabs, these\r\n_Eurypterids_ must have been swimmers, careering rapidly through the\r\nwater, and probably active and predaceous. There were also great\r\nmultitudes of those little crustaceans which are inclosed in two horny\r\nor shelly valves like a bivalve shell-fish, and the remains of which\r\nsometimes fill certain beds of Silurian shale and limestone.\r\n\r\nNo remains found in the Silurian rocks have been more fertile sources\r\nof discussion then the so-called _Graptolites_, or written stones--a\r\nname given long ago by Linnæus, in allusion to the resemblance of some\r\nspecies having rows of cells on one side, to minute lines of writing.\r\nThese little bodies usually appear as black coaly stains on the\r\nsurface of the rock, showing a slender stem or stalk, with a row of\r\nlittle projecting cells at one side, or two rows, one on each side.\r\nThe more perfect specimens show that, in many of the species at least,\r\nthese fragments were branches of a complex organism spreading from a\r\ncentre; and at this centre there is sometimes perceived a sort of\r\nmembrane connecting the bases of the branches, and for which various\r\nuses have been conjectured. The branches themselves vary much in\r\ndifferent species. They may be simple or divided, narrow, or broad and\r\nleaf-like, with one row of cells, or two rows of cells. Hence arise\r\ngeneric distinctions into single and double graptolites, leaf and tree\r\ngraptolites, net graptolites, and so on. But while it is easy to\r\nrecognise these organisms, and to classify them in species and genera,\r\nit is not so easy to say what their affinities are with modern things.\r\nThey are exclusively Silurian, disappearing altogether at the close of\r\nthis period, and, so far as we know, not succeeded by any similar\r\ncreatures serving to connect them with modern forms. Hence the most\r\nvarious conjectures as to their nature. They have been supposed to be\r\nplants, and have been successively referred to most of the great\r\ndivisions of the lower animals. Most recently they have been regarded\r\nby Hall, Nicholson,[J] and others, who have studied them most\r\nattentively, as zoophytes or hydroids allied to the Sertularise, or\r\ntooth-corallines and sea-fir-corallines of our coasts, to the\r\ncell-bearing branches of which their fragments bear a very close\r\nresemblance. In this case, each of the little cells or teeth at the\r\nsides of the fibres must have been the abode of a little polyp,\r\nstretching out its tentacles into the water, and enjoying a common\r\nsupport and nutrition with the other polyps ranged with it. Still the\r\nmode of life of the community of branching stems is uncertain. In some\r\nspecies there is a little radicle or spike at the base of the main\r\nstem, which may have been a means of attachment. In others the hollow\r\ncentral disk has been conjectured to have served as a float. Occurring\r\nas the specimens do usually in shales and slates, which must have been\r\nmuddy beds, they could not have been attached to stones or rocks, and\r\nthey must have lived in clear water, either seated on the surface of\r\nthe mud, attached to sea-weeds, or floating freely by means of hollow\r\ndisks filled with air. After much thought on their structure and mode\r\nof occurrence, I am inclined to believe that in their younger stages\r\nthey were attached, but by a very slender thread; that at a more\r\nadvanced stage they became free, and acquiring a central membranous\r\ndisk filled with air, floated by means of this at the surface, their\r\nlong branches trailing in the waters below. They would thus be, with\r\nreference to their mode of life, though not to the details of their\r\nstructure, prototypes of the modern Portuguese man-of-war, which now\r\ndrifts so gaily over the surface of the warmer seas. I have\r\nrepresented them in this attitude; but in case I should be mistaken,\r\nthe reader may imagine it possible that they may be adhering to the\r\nlower surface of floating tangle. The head-quarters of the Graptolites\r\nseem to be in the upper part of the Cambrian, and in the\r\nSiluro-Cambrian, and they are widely distributed in Europe, in\r\nAmerica, and in Australia. This very wide distribution of the species\r\nis probably connected with their floating and oceanic habits.\r\n\r\n[J] See also an able paper by Carruthers, in the _Geological\r\nMagazine_, vol. v., p. 64.\r\n\r\nLastly, just as the Silurian period was passing away, we find a new\r\nthing in the earth--vertebrate animals, represented by several species\r\nof shark-like fishes, which came in here as forerunners of the dynasty\r\nof the vertebrates, which from that day to this have been the masters\r\nof the world. These earliest vertebrates are especially interesting as\r\nthe first known examples of a plan of structure which culminates only\r\nin man himself. They appear to have had cartilaginous skeletons; and\r\nin this and their shagreen-like skin, strong bony spines, and\r\ntrenchant teeth, to have much resembled our modern sharks, or rather\r\nthe dog-fishes, for they were of small size. One genus (_Pteraspis_),\r\napparently the oldest of the whole, belongs, however, to a tribe of\r\nmailed fishes allied to some of those of the old red sandstone. In\r\nboth cases the groups of fishes representing the first known\r\nappearance of the vertebrates were allied to tribes of somewhat high\r\norganization in that class; and they asserted their claims to\r\ndominancy by being predaceous and carnivorous creatures, which must\r\nhave rendered themselves formidable to their invertebrate\r\ncontemporaries. Coprolites, or fossil masses of excrement, which are\r\nfound with them, indicate that they chased and devoured orthoceratites\r\nand sea-snails of various kinds, and snapped Lingulæ and crinoids from\r\ntheir stalks; and we can well imagine that these creatures, when once\r\nintroduced, found themselves in rich pasture and increased\r\naccordingly. Space prevents us from following further our pictures of\r\nthe animal life of the great Silurian era, the monuments of which were\r\nfirst discovered by two of England's greatest geologists, Murchison\r\nand Sedgwick. How imperfect such a notice must be, may be learned from\r\nthe fact that Dr. Bigsby, in his \"Thesaurus Siluricus\" in 1868,\r\ncatalogues 8,897 Silurian species, of which only 972 are known in the\r\nPrimordial.\r\n\r\nOur illustration, carefully studied, may do more to present to the\r\nreader the teeming swarms of the Silurian seas then our word-picture,\r\nand it includes many animal forms not mentioned above, more especially\r\nthe curved and nautilus-like cuttle-fishes, those singular molluscous\r\nswimmers by fin or float known to zoologists as violet-snails,\r\nwinged-snails or pteropods, and carinarias; and which, under various\r\nforms, have existed from the Silurian to the present time. The old\r\n_Lingulæ_ are also there as well as in the Primordial, while the fishes\r\nand the land vegetation belong, as far as we yet know, exclusively to\r\nthe Upper Silurian, and point forward to the succeeding Devonian. We\r\nknow as yet no Silurian animal that lived on the land or breathed air.\r\nBut our knowledge of land plants, though very meagre, is important.\r\nWithout regarding such obscure and uncertain forms as the _Eophyton_\r\nof Sweden, Hooker, Page, and Barrande have noticed, in the Upper\r\nSilurian, plants allied to the Lycopods or club-mosses. I have found\r\nin the same deposits another group of plants allied to Lycopods and\r\npill-worts (Psilophyton), and fragments of wood representing the\r\ncurious and primitive type of pine-like trees known as _Prototaxites_.\r\nThese are probably only a small instalment of Silurian land plants,\r\nsuch as a voyager might find floating in the sea on his approach to\r\nsome unknown shore, which had not yet risen above his horizon. Time\r\nand careful search will, no doubt, add largely to our knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn the Silurian, as in the Cambrian, the head-quarters of animal life\r\nwere in the sea. Perhaps there was no animal life on the land; but\r\nhere our knowledge may be at fault. It is, however, interesting to\r\nobserve the continued operation of the creative fiat, \"Let the waters\r\nswarm with swarmers\" which, beginning to be obeyed in the Eozoic age,\r\npasses down through all the periods of geological time to the \"moving\r\nthings innumerable\" of the modern ocean. Can we infer anything further\r\nas to the laws of creation from these Silurian multitudes of living\r\nthings? One thing we can see plainly, that the life of the Silurian is\r\nclosely related to that of the Cambrian. The same generic and ordinal\r\nforms are continued. Even some species may be identical. Does this\r\nindicate direct genetic connection, or only like conditions in the\r\nexternal world correlated with likeness in the organic world? It\r\nindicates both. First, it is in the highest degree probable that many\r\nof the animals of the Lower Silurian are descendants of those of the\r\nCambrian. Sometimes these descendants may be absolutely unchanged.\r\nSometimes they may appear as distinct varieties. Sometimes they may\r\nhave been regarded as distinct though allied species. The continuance\r\nin this manner of allied forms of life is necessarily related to the\r\ncontinuance of somewhat similar conditions of existence, while changes\r\nin type imply changed external conditions. But is this all? I think\r\nnot; for there are forms of life in the Silurian which cannot be\r\ntraced to the Cambrian, and which relate to new and even prospective\r\nconditions, which the unaided powers of the animals of the earlier\r\nperiod could not have provided for. These new forms require the\r\nintervention of a higher power, capable of correlating the physical\r\nand organic conditions of one period with those of succeeding periods.\r\nWhatever powers may be attributed to natural selection or to any other\r\nconceivable cause of merely genetic evolution, surely prophetic gifts\r\ncannot be claimed for it; and the life of all these geological periods\r\nis full of mute prophecies to be read only in the light of subsequent\r\nfulfilments.\r\n\r\nThe fishes of the Upper Silurian are such a prophecy. They can claim\r\nno parentage in the older rocks, and they appear at once as kings of\r\ntheir class. With reference to the Silurian itself, they are of little\r\nconsequence; and in the midst of its gigantic forms of invertebrate\r\nlife they seem almost misplaced. But they predict the coming Devonian,\r\nand that long and varied reign of vertebrate life which culminates in\r\nman himself. No such prophetic ideas are represented by the giant\r\ncrustaceans and cuttle-fishes and swarming graptolites. They had\r\nalready attained their maximum, and were destined to a speedy and\r\nfinal grave in the Silurian, or to be perpetuated only in decaying\r\nfamilies whose poverty is rendered more conspicuous by the contrast\r\nwith the better days gone by. The law of creation provided for new\r\ntypes, and at once for the elevation and degradation of them when\r\nintroduced; and all this with reference to the physical conditions not\r\nof the present only but of the future. Such facts, which cannot be\r\nignored save by the wilfully blind, are beyond the reach of any merely\r\nmaterial philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe little that we know of Silurian plants is as eloquent of plan and\r\ncreation as that which we can learn of animals. I saw not long ago a\r\nseries of genealogies in geological time reduced to tabular form by\r\nthat ingenious but imaginative physiologist, Haeckel. In one of these\r\nappeared the imaginary derivation of the higher plants from Algæ or\r\nsea-weeds. Nothing could more curiously contradict actual facts. Algæ\r\nwere apparently in the Silurian neither more nor less elevated then in\r\nthe modern seas, and those forms of vegetable life which may seem to\r\nbridge over the space between them and the land plants in the modern\r\nperiod, are wanting in the older geological periods, while land plants\r\nseem to start at once into being in the guise of club-mosses, a group\r\nby no means of low standing. Our oldest land plants thus represent one\r\nof the highest types of that cryptogamous series to which they belong,\r\nand moreover are better developed examples of that type then those now\r\nexisting. We may say, if we please, that all the connecting links have\r\nbeen lost; but this is begging the whole question, since no thing 'but\r\nthe existence of such links could render the hypothesis of derivation\r\npossible. Further, the occurrence of any number of successive yet\r\ndistinct species would not be the kind of chain required, or rather\r\nwould not be a chain at all.\r\n\r\nYet in some respects development is obvious in creation. Old forms of\r\nlife are often embryonic, or resemble the young of modern animals, but\r\nenlarged and exaggerated, as if they had overgrown themselves and had\r\nprematurely become adult. Old forms are often generalized, or less\r\nspecific in their adaptations then those of modern times. There is\r\nless division of labour among them. Old forms sometimes not only rise\r\nto the higher places in their groups, but usurp attributes which in\r\nlater times are restricted to their betters. Old forms are often\r\ngigantic in size in comparison with their modern successors, which, if\r\nthey could look back on their predecessors, might say, \"There were\r\ngiants in those days.\" Some old forms have gone onward in successive\r\nstages of elevation by a regular and constant gradation. Others have\r\nremained as they were through all the ages, Some have no equals in\r\ntheir groups in modern days. All these things speak of order, but of\r\norder along with development, and this development not evolution;\r\nunless by this term we understand the emergence into material facts of\r\nthe plans of the creative mind. These plans we may hope in some degree\r\nto understand, though we may not be able to comprehend the mode of\r\naction of creative power any more then the mode in which our own\r\nthought and will act upon the machinery of our own nerves. Still, the\r\npower is not the less real, that we are ignorant of its mode of\r\noperation. The wind bloweth whither it listeth, and we feel its\r\nstrength, though we may not be able to calculate the wind of to-morrow\r\nor the winds of last year. So is the Spirit of God when it breathes\r\ninto animals the breath of life, or the Almighty word when it says,\r\n\"Let the waters bring forth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE DEVONIAN AGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nParadoxical as it may appear, this period of geological history has\r\nbeen held as of little account, and has even been by some geologists\r\nregarded as scarcely a distinct age, just because it was one of the\r\nmost striking and important of the whole. The Devonian was an age of\r\nchange and transition, in both physical and organic existence; and an\r\nage which introduced, in the Northern hemisphere at least, more varied\r\nconditions of land and water and climate then had previously existed.\r\nHence, over large areas of our continents, its deposits are irregular\r\nand locally diverse; and the duration and importance of the period are\r\nto be measured rather by the changes and alterations of previous\r\nformations, and the ejection of masses of molten rock from beneath,\r\nthen by a series of fossiliferous deposits. Nevertheless, in some\r\nregions in North America and Eastern Europe, the formations of this\r\nera are of vast extent and volume, those of North America being\r\nestimated at the enormous thickness of 15,000 feet, while they are\r\nspread over areas of almost continental breadth.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Upper Silurian, the vast continental plateaus of\r\nthe northern hemisphere were almost wholly submerged. No previous\r\nmarine limestone spreads more widely then that of the Upper Silurian,\r\nand in no previous period have we much less evidence of the existence\r\nof dry land; yet before the end of the period we observe, in a few\r\nfragments of land plants scattered here and there in the marine\r\nlimestones--evidence that islands rose amid the waste of waters. As it\r\nis said that the sailors of Columbus saw the first indications of the\r\nstill unseen Western Continent in drift canes, and fragments of trees\r\nfloating in mid ocean, so the voyager through the Silurian seas finds\r\nhis approach to the verdant shores of the Devonian presaged by a few\r\ndrift plants borne from shores yet below the horizon. The small\r\nremains of land in the Upper Silurian were apparently limited to\r\ncertain clusters of islands in the north-eastern part of America and\r\nnorth-western part of Europe, with perhaps some in the intervening\r\nAtlantic On these limited surfaces grew the first land plants\r\ncertainly known to us--herbs and trees allied to the modern\r\nclub-mosses, and perhaps forests of trees allied to the pines, though\r\nof humbler type; and this wide Upper Silurian sea, with archipelagos\r\nof wooded islands, may have continued for a long time. But with the\r\nbeginning of the Devonian, indications of an unstable condition of the\r\nearth's crust began to develop themselves. New lands were upheaved;\r\ngreat shallow, muddy, and sandy flats were deposited around them the\r\ndomains of corals and sea-weeds were contracted and on banks, and in\r\nshallows and estuaries, there swarmed shoals of fishes of many\r\nspecies, and some of them of most remarkable organization. On the\r\nmargins of these waters stretched vast swamps, covered with a rank\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nBut the period was one of powerful igneous activity. Volcanoes poured\r\nout their molten rocks over sea and land, and injected huge dykes of\r\ntrap into the newly-formed beds. The land was shaken with earthquake\r\nthroes, and was subject to many upheavals and subsidences. Violent\r\nwaves desolated the coasts, throwing sand and gravel over the flats,\r\nand tearing up newly-deposited beds; and poisonous exhalations, or\r\nsudden changes of level, often proved fatal to immense shoals of\r\nfishes. This was the time of the Lower Devonian, and it is marked,\r\nboth in the old world and the new, by extensive deposits of sandstones\r\nand conglomerates.\r\n\r\nBut the changes going on at the surface were only symptomatic of those\r\noccurring beneath. The immense accumulations of Silurian sediment had\r\nby this time so overweighted certain portions of the crust, that great\r\nquantities of aqueous sediment had been pressed downward into the\r\nheated bowels of the earth, and were undergoing, under an enormous\r\nweight of superincumbent material, a process of baking and\r\nsemi-fusion. This process was of course extremely active along the\r\nmargins of the old Silurian plateaus, and led to great elevation of\r\nland, while in the more central parts of the plateaus the oceanic\r\nconditions still continued; and in the Middle Devonian, in America at\r\nleast, one of the most remarkable and interesting coral limestones in\r\nthe world--the corniferous limestone--was deposited. In process of\r\ntime, however, these clear waters became shallow, and were invaded by\r\nmuddy sediments; and in the Upper Devonian the swampy flats and muddy\r\nshallows return in full force, and in some degree anticipate the still\r\ngreater areas of this kind which existed in the succeeding Coal\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief sketch of the Devonian, or, as it may be better called\r\nin America, from the vast development of its beds on the south side of\r\nLake Erie, the _Erian_ formation. In America the marine beds of the\r\nDevonian were deposited on the same great continental plateau which\r\nsupported the seas of the Upper and Lower Silurian, and the beds were\r\nthicker towards the east and thinned towards the west, as in the case\r\nof the older series. But in the Devonian there was much, land in the\r\nnorth-east of America; and on the eastern margin of this land, as in\r\nGaspé and New Brunswick, the deposits throughout the whole period were\r\nsandstones and shales, without the great coral limestones of the\r\ncentral plateau. Something of the same kind occurred in Europe, where,\r\nhowever, the area of Devonian sea was smaller. There the fossiliferous\r\nlimestones of the Middle Devonian in Devon, in the Eifel district, in\r\nFrance and in Russia, represent the great corniferous limestone of\r\nAmerica; while the sandstones of South Wales, of Ireland, and of\r\nScotland, resemble the local conditions of Gaspé and New Brunswick,\r\nand belonged to a similar area in the north-west of Europe, in which\r\nshallow water and land conditions prevailed during the whole of the\r\nDevonian, and which was perhaps connected with the corresponding\r\nregion in Eastern America by a North Atlantic archipelago, now\r\nsubmerged. This whole subject is so important to the knowledge of the\r\nDevonian, and of geology in general, that I may be pardoned for\r\nintroducing it here in a tabular form, taking the European series from\r\nEtheridge's excellent and exhaustive paper in the \"Journal of the\r\nGeological Society.\"\r\n\r\nDEVONIAN OF ERIAN.\r\n\r\n  DIVISIONS.

But the one\r\nrepresents the shallow, and the other the deeper seas of the same\r\nperiod. We learn this by careful tracing of the beds to their junction\r\nwith, corresponding series, and by the occasional occurrence of the\r\ncharacteristic fishes of the Scottish strata in the English and German\r\nbeds. In like manner a geologist who explores the Gaspé sandstones or\r\nthe New Brunswick shales has under his consideration a group of beds\r\nvery dissimilar from that which he would have to study on the shores\r\nof Lake Erie. But here again identity of relations to the Silurian\r\nbelow and the carboniferous above, shows the contemporaneousness of\r\nthe beds, and this is confirmed by the occurrence in both series of\r\nsome of the same plants and shells and fishes.\r\n\r\nIt will further be observed that it is in the middle that the greatest\r\ndifference occurs. Sand and mud and pebble-banks were almost universal\r\nover our two great continental plateaus in the Older and Newer\r\nDevonian. But in the Middle there were in some places deeper waters\r\nwith coral reefs, in others shallow flats and swamps rich in\r\nvegetation. Herein we see the greater variety and richness of the\r\nDevonian. Had we lived in that age, we should not have seen great\r\ncontinents like those that now exist, but we could have roamed over\r\nlovely islands with breezy hills and dense lowland jungles, and we\r\ncould have sailed over blue coral seas, glowing below with all the\r\nfanciful forms and brilliant colours of polyp life, and filled with\r\nactive and beautiful fishes. Especially did all these conditions\r\nculminate in the Middle Devonian, when what are now the continental\r\nareas of the northern hemisphere must have much resembled the present\r\ninsular and oceanic regions of the South Pacific.\r\n\r\nOut of the rich and varied life of the Devonian I may select for\r\nillustration its corals, its crustaceans, its fishes, its plants, and\r\nits insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--CORALS, FISHES, AND CRUSTACEANS OF THE\r\nDEVONIAN\r\n\r\nIn the foreground are Corals of the genera _Favosites_, _Michelina_,\r\n_Phillipsatrea_, _Zaphrentis_, _Blothrophyllum_, and _Syringopora_,\r\nand the seaweed Spirephyton; also Fishes of the genera _Cephalaspis_\r\nand _Pterichthys_. Above are _Pterygotus_ and _Dinichtys_, with Fishes\r\nof the genera _Diplacanthus_, _Osteolepis_, _Holoptychius_,\r\n_Pteraspis_, _Coccosteus_, etc. The distant land had _Lepidodendra_,\r\nPines and Tree-ferns.]\r\n\r\nThe central limestones of the Devonian may be regarded as the\r\nhead-quarters of the peculiar types of coral characteristic of the\r\nPalæozoic age. Here they were not only vastly numerous, but present\r\nsome of their grandest and also their most peculiar forms. Edwards and\r\nHaime, in their \"Monograph of British Fossil Corals\" in 1854,\r\nenumerate one hundred and fifty well-ascertained species, and the\r\nnumber has since been largely increased; I have no doubt that my\r\nfriend Dr. Bigsby, in his forth-coming \"Thesaurus Devonicus,\" will\r\nmore then double it. In the Devonian limestones of England, as for\r\ninstance at Torquay, the specimens, though abundant and well preserved\r\nas to their internal structure, are too firmly imbedded in the rock to\r\nshow their external forms. In the Devonian of the continent of Europe\r\nmuch finer specimens occur; but, perhaps, in no part of the world is\r\nthere so clear an exhibition of them as in the Devonian limestones of\r\nthe United States and Canada. Sir Charles Lyell thus expresses his\r\nadmiration of the exposure of these corals, which he saw at the falls\r\nof the Ohio, near Louisville. He says, \"Although the water was not at\r\nits lowest, I saw a grand display of what may be termed an ancient\r\ncoral-reef, formed by zoophytes which flourished in a sea of earlier\r\ndate then the Carboniferous period. The ledges of horizontal\r\nlimestone, over which the water flows, belong to the Devonian group,\r\nand the softer parts of the stone have decomposed and wasted away, so\r\nthat the harder calcareous corals stand out in relief. Many branches\r\nof these zoophytes project from their erect stems precisely as if they\r\nwere living. Among other species I observed large masses, not less\r\nthen five feet in diameter, of _Favosites Gothlandica_, with its\r\nbeautiful honeycomb structure well displayed. There was also the\r\ncup-shaped _Cyathophyllum_, and the delicate network of _Fenestella_,\r\nand that elegant and well-known European species of fossil, the chain\r\ncoral, _Catenipora escharoides_, with a profusion of others which it\r\nwould be tedious to all but the geologist to enumerate. Although\r\nhundreds of fine specimens have been detached from these rocks to\r\nenrich the museums of Europe and America, another crop is constantly\r\nworking its way out under the action of the stream, and of the sun and\r\nrain in the warm season when the channel is laid dry.\"[K] These\r\nlimestones have been estimated to extend, as an almost continuous\r\ncoral reef, over the enormous area of five hundred thousand square\r\nmiles of the now dry and inland surface of the great American\r\ncontinental plateau. The limestones described by Sir Charles are known\r\nin the Western States as the \"Cliff limestone.\" In the State of New\r\nYork and in Western Canada the \"Corniferous limestone,\" so called from\r\nthe masses of hornstone, like the flint of the English chalk,\r\ncontained in it, presents still more remarkable features. The corals\r\nwhich it contains have been replaced by the siliceous or flinty\r\nmatter in such a manner that, when the surrounding limestone weathers\r\naway, they remain projecting in relief in all the beauty of their\r\noriginal forms. Not only so, but on the surface of the country they\r\nremain as hard siliceous stones, and may be found in ploughing the\r\nsoil and in stone fences and roadside heaps, so that tons of them\r\ncould often be collected over a very limited space. When only partly\r\ndisengaged from the matrix, the process may be completed by immersing\r\nthem in a dilute acid. The beauty of these specimens when thus\r\nprepared is very great not at all inferior to that of modern corals,\r\nwhich they often much resemble in general form, though differing in\r\ndetails of structure. One of the most common forms is that of the\r\n_Favosites_, or honeycomb coral, presenting regular hexagonal cells\r\nwith transverse floors or tabulæ. Of these there are several species,\r\nusually flat or massive in form; but one species, _F. polymorpha_,\r\nbranches out like the modern stag-horn corals. Another curious form,\r\n_Michelina_, looks exactly like a mass of the papery cells of the\r\ngreat American hornet in a petrified state, and the convex floors\r\nsimulate the covers of the cells, so that it is quite common to find\r\nthem called fossil wasps' nests. Some of the largest belong to the\r\ngenus _Phillipsastrea_ or _Smithia_, which Hugh Miller has\r\nimmortalized by comparing its crowded stars, with confluent rays, to\r\nthe once-popular calico pattern known as \"Lane's net\"--a singular\r\ninstance of the accidental concurrence of a natural and artificial\r\ndesign. Another very common type is that of the conical _Zaphrentis_,\r\nwith a deep cut at top to lodge the body of the animal, whose\r\nradiating chambers are faithfully represented by it's delicate\r\nlamellæ. Perhaps the most delicate of the whole is the _Syringopora_,\r\nwith its cylindrical worm-like pipes bound together by transverse\r\nprocesses, and which sometimes can be dissolved out in all its fragile\r\nperfection by the action of an acid on a mass of Corniferous limestone\r\nfilled with these corals in a silicified state.\r\n\r\n[K] \"Travels in North America.\" second series.\r\n\r\nThese Devonian corals, like those of the Silurian, belong to the great\r\nextinct groups of Tabulate and Rugose corals; groups which present, on\r\nthe one hand, points of resemblance to the ordinary coral animals of\r\nthe modern seas, and, on the other, to those somewhat exceptional\r\ncorals, the Millepores, which are produced by another kind of polyp,\r\nthe Hydroids. Some of them obviously combine properties belonging to\r\nboth, as, for example, the radiating partitions with the arrangement\r\nof the parts in multiples of four, the horizontal floors, and the\r\nexternal solid wall; and this fact countenances the conclusion that in\r\nthese old corals we have a group of high and complex organization,\r\ncombining properties now divided between two great groups of animals,\r\nneither of them probably, either in their stony skeletons or the soft\r\nparts of the animal, of as high organization as their Paleozoic\r\npredecessors. This sort of disintegration of composite types, or\r\ndissolution of old partnerships, seems to have been no unusual\r\noccurrence in the history of life.[L]\r\n\r\n[L] Verril has suggested that the Tabulata may be divided into two\r\ngroups, one referable to Actinoids, the other to Hydroids.\r\n\r\nIf the Devonian witnessed the culmination of the Palæozoic corals, its\r\nlater stages saw the final decadence of the great dynasty of the\r\nTrilobites. Of these creatures there are in the Devonian some large\r\nand ornate species, remarkable for their spines and tubercles; as if\r\nin this, the latter day of their dominion, they had fallen into habits\r\nof luxurious decoration unknown to their sterner predecessors, and at\r\nthe same time had found it necessary to surround their now disputed\r\nprivileges with new safeguards of defensive armour. Not improbably the\r\ndecadence of the Trilobites may have been connected with the\r\nintroduction of the numerous and formidable fishes of the period.\r\n\r\nBut while the venerable race of the Trilobites was preparing to fight\r\nits last and unsuccessful battle, another and scarcely less ancient\r\ntribe of crustaceans, the Eurypterids, already strong in the Silurian,\r\nwas armed with new and formidable powers. The _Pterygotus anglicus_,\r\nwhich should have been named _scoticus_, since its head-quarters are\r\nin Scotland, was in point of size the greatest of known crustaceans,\r\nrecent or fossil. According to Mr. Henry Woodward, who has published\r\nan admirable description and figures of the creature in the\r\nPalæontographical Society's Memoirs, it must have been six feet in\r\nlength, and nearly two feet in breadth. Its antennæ were, unlike the\r\nharmless feelers of modern Crustacea, armed with powerful claws. Two\r\ngreat eyes stood in the front of the head, and two smaller ones on the\r\ntop. It had four pairs of great serrated jaws, the largest as wide as\r\na man's hand. At the sides were a pair of powerful paddles, capable of\r\nurging it swiftly through the water as it pursued its prey; and when\r\nattacked by any predaceous fish, it could strike the water with its\r\nbroad tail, terminated by a great flat \"telson,\" and retreat backward\r\nwith the rapidity of an arrow. Woodward says it must have been the\r\n\"shark of the Devonian seas;\" rather, it was the great champion of the\r\nmore ancient family of the lobsters, set to arrest, if possible, the\r\nencroachments of the coming sharks.\r\n\r\nThe Trilobites and Eurypterids constitute a hard case for the\r\nderivationists. Unlike those Melchisedeks, the fishes of the Silurian,\r\nwhich are without father or mother, the Devonian crustaceans may boast\r\nof their descent, but they have no descendants. No distinct link\r\nconnects them with any modern crustaceans except the Limuli, or\r\nhorse-shoe crabs; and here the connection is most puzzling, for while\r\nthere seems some intelligible resemblance between the adult\r\nEurypterids and the horse-shoe, or king-crabs, the latter, in their\r\nyounger state, rather resemble Trilobites, as Dr. Packard has recently\r\nshown. Thus the two great tribes of Eurypterids and Trilobites have\r\nunited in the small modern group of king-crabs, while on the other\r\nhand, there are points of resemblance, as already stated, between\r\nTrilobites and Isopods, and the king-crabs had already begun to exist,\r\nsince one species is now known in the Upper Silurian. So puzzling are\r\nthese various relationships, that one naturalist of the derivationist\r\nschool has recently attempted to solve the difficulty by suggesting\r\nthat the Trilobites are allied to the spiders! Thus nature sports with\r\nour theories, showing us in some cases, as in the corals and fishes,\r\npartnerships split up into individuals, and in others distinct lines\r\nof being converging and becoming lost in one slender thread. Barrande,\r\nthe great palæontologist of Bohemia, has recently, in an elaborate\r\nmemoir on the Trilobites, traced these and other points through all\r\ntheir structures and their whole succession in geological time thereby\r\nelaborating a most powerful inductive argument against the theory of\r\nevolution, and concluding that, so far from the history of these\r\ncreatures favouring such a theory, it seems as if expressly contrived\r\nto exclude its possibility.\r\n\r\nBut, while the gigantic Eurypterids and ornate Trilobites of the\r\nDevonian were rapidly approaching their end, a few despised little\r\ncrustaceans,--represented by the _Amphipeltis_ of New Brunswick and\r\n_Kampecaris_ of Scotland,--were obscurely laying the foundation of a\r\nnew line of beings, that of the Stomapods, destined to culminate in\r\nthe Squillas and their allies, which, however different in structure,\r\nare practically the Eurypterids of the modern ocean. So change the\r\ndynasties of men and animals.\r\n\r\n    \"Thou takest away their breath, they die,\r\n       They return to their dust;\r\n     Thou sendest forth Thy Spirit,\r\n       They are created;\r\n     Thou renewest the form of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nThe reign of fishes began in the Upper Silurian, for in the rocks of\r\nthis age, more especially in England, several species have been found.\r\nThey occur, however, only in the newer beds of this formation, and are\r\nnot of large size, nor very abundant. It is to be observed that, in so\r\nfar as the fragments discovered can be interpreted, they indicate the\r\nexistence already of two distinct types of fishes, the Ganoids, or\r\ngar-fishes, protected with bony plates and scales, and the Placoids,\r\nor shark-like fishes; and that in the existing world these fishes are\r\nregarded as occupying a high place in their class. Further, these two\r\ngroups of fishes are those which throughout a large portion of\r\ngeological time continue to prevail to the exclusion of other types,\r\nthe ordinary bony fishes having been introduced only in comparatively\r\nrecent periods. With the Devonian, however, there comes a vast\r\nincrease to the finny armies; and so characteristic are these that the\r\nDevonian has been called the age of fishes _par excellence_, and we\r\nmust try, with the help of our illustration, to paint these old\r\ninhabitants of the waters as distinctly as we can. Among the most\r\nancient and curious of these fishes are those singular forms covered\r\nwith broad plates, of which the _Pteraspis_ of the Upper Silurian is\r\nthe herald, and which are represented in the Lower Devonian by several\r\ndistinct genera. Of these, one of the most curious is the\r\n_Cephalaspis_, or buckler-head, distinguished by its broad flat head,\r\nrounded in front and prolonged at the sides into two great spines,\r\nwhich project far beyond the sides of the comparatively slender body.\r\nThis fish, it may be mentioned, is the type of a family highly\r\ncharacteristic of the Lower Devonian, as well as of the Upper\r\nSilurian, and all of which are provided with large plate-like cephalic\r\ncoverings, sometimes with a long snout in front, and, in so far as is\r\nknown, a comparatively weak body and tail. They were all probably\r\nground-living creatures, feeding on worms and shell-fishes, and\r\n\"rooting\" for these in the mud, or burrowing therein for their safety.\r\nIn these respects they have a most curious analogy to the Trilobites,\r\nwhich in habits they must have greatly resembled, though belonging by\r\ntheir structure to an entirely different and much higher class. So\r\nclose is this resemblance, that their head-shields used to be mistaken\r\nfor those of Trilobites. The case is one of those curious analogies\r\nwhich often occur in nature, and which must always be distinguished\r\nfrom the true affinities which rest on structural resemblances.\r\nAnother group of small fishes, likewise cuirassed in bony armour of\r\nplates, may be represented by the _Pterichthys_, with its two strong\r\nbony fins at the sides, which may have served for swimming, but\r\nprobably also for defence, and for creeping on or shovelling up the\r\nmud at the bottom of the sea. But, besides the Ganoids which were\r\narmed in plated cuirasses, there were others, active and voracious,\r\nclad in shining enamelled scales, like the bony pikes of the American\r\nrivers and the _Polypterus_ of the Nile. Some of these, like the\r\n_Diplacanthus_, or \"double-spine\" were of small size, and chiefly\r\nremarkable for their sharp defensive bony spines. Others, like\r\n_Holoptychius_ (wrinkled-scale) and _Osteolepis_ (bone-scale), were\r\nstrongly built, and sometimes of great size. One Russian species of\r\n_Asterolepis_ (star-scale) is supposed to have been twenty feet in\r\nlength, and furnished with strong and trenchant teeth in two rows.\r\nThese great fishes afford a good reason for the spines and\r\narmour-plates of the contemporary trilobites and smaller fishes. Just\r\nas man has been endeavouring to invent armour impenetrable to shot,\r\nfor soldiers and for ships, and, on the other hand, shot and shells\r\nthat can penetrate any armoury so nature has always presented the\r\nspectacle of the most perfect defensive apparatus matched with the\r\nmost perfect weapons for destruction. In the class of fishes, no age\r\nof the world is more eminent in these respects then the Devonian.[M]\r\nIn addition to these fishes, there were others, represented\r\nprincipally by their strong bony spines, which must have been allied\r\nto some of the families of modern sharks, most of them, however,\r\nprobably to that comparatively harmless tribe which, furnished with\r\nflat teeth, prey upon shell-fishes. There are other fishes difficult\r\nto place in our systems of classification; and among these an eminent\r\nexample is the huge _Dinichthys_ of Newberry, from the Hamilton group\r\nof Ohio. The head of this creature is more then three feet long and\r\neighteen inches broad, with the bones extraordinarily strong and\r\nmassive. In the upper jaw, in addition to strong teeth, there were in\r\nfront two huge sabre-shaped tusks or incisors, each nearly a foot\r\nlong; and corresponding to these in the massive lower jaw were two\r\nclosely joined conical tusks, fitting between those of the upper jaw.\r\nNo other fish presents so frightful an apparatus for destruction; and\r\nif, as is probable, this was attached to a powerful body, perhaps\r\nthirty feet in length, and capable of rapid motion through the water,\r\nwe cannot imagine any creature so strong or so well armed as to cope\r\nwith the mighty _Dinichthys_.\r\n\r\n[M] Many of these were discovered and successfully displayed and\r\ndescribed by Hugh Miller, and are graphically portrayed in his\r\ncelebrated work on the \"Old Red Sandstone,\" published in 1841.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the fishes of the Devonian and those of the\r\nmodern seas is well marked by the fact that, while the ordinary bony\r\nfishes now amount to probably 9,000 species, and the ganoid fishes to\r\nless then thirty, the finny tribes of the Devonian are predominantly\r\nganoids, and none of the ordinary type are known. To what is this\r\nrelated, with reference to conditions of existence? Two explanations,\r\ndifferent yet mutually connected, may be suggested. One is that armour\r\nwas especially useful in the Devonian as a means of defence from the\r\nlarger predaceous species, and the gigantic crustaceans of the period.\r\nthat this was the case may be inferred from the conditions of\r\nexistence of some modern ganoids. The common bony pike of Canada\r\n(_Lepidosteus_), frequenting shallow and stagnant waters, seems to be\r\nespecially exposed to injury from its enemies. Consequently, while it\r\nis rare to find an ordinary fish showing any traces of wounds, a large\r\nproportion of the specimens of the bony pike which I have examined\r\nhave scars on their scales, indicating injuries which they have\r\nexperienced, and which possibly, to fishes not so well armed, might\r\nhave proved fatal. Again, in the modern Amia, or mud-fish, in the bony\r\npike and _Polypterus_, there is an extremely large air-bladder, amply\r\nsupplied with blood-vessels, and even divided into cells or chambers,\r\nand communicating with the mouth by an \"air-duct.\" This organ is\r\nunquestionably in function a lung, and enables the animal to dispense\r\nin some degree with the use of its gills, which of course depend for\r\ntheir supply of vital air on the small quantity of oxygen dissolved in\r\nthe water. Hence, by the power of partially breathing air, these\r\nfishes can live in stagnant and badly aerated waters, where other\r\nfishes would perish. In the case of the _Amia_, the grunting noises\r\nwhich it utters, its habit of frequenting the muddy creeks of swamps,\r\nand its possession of gill-cleaners, correspond with this view. It is\r\npossible that the Devonian fishes possessed this semi-reptilian\r\nrespiration; and if so, they would be better adapted then other fishes\r\nto live in water contaminated with organic matter in a state of decay,\r\nor in waters rich in carbonic acid or deficient in oxygen. Possibly\r\nthe palæozoic waters, as well as the palæozoic atmosphere, were less\r\nrich in pure oxygen then those of the present world; and it is certain\r\nthat, in many of the beds in which the smaller Devonian fishes abound,\r\nthere was so much decaying vegetable matter as to make it probable\r\nthat the water was unfit for the ordinary fishes. Thus, though at\r\nfirst sight the possession of external armour and means to respire\r\nair, in the case of these peculiar fishes, may seem to have no direct\r\nconnection with each other, their obvious correlation in some modern\r\nganoids may have had its parallel on a more extensive scale among\r\ntheir ancient relatives. Just as the modern gar-fish, by virtue of its\r\nlungs, can live in stagnant shallows and hunt frogs, but on that\r\naccount needs strong armour to defend it against the foes that assail\r\nit in such places; so in the Devonian the capacity to inhabit\r\nunaërated water and defensive plates and scales may have been alike\r\nnecessary, especially to the feebler tribes of fishes. We shall find\r\nthat in the succeeding carboniferous period there is equally good\r\nevidence of this.\r\n\r\nWe have reserved little space for the Devonian plants and insects; but\r\nwe may notice both in a walk through a Devonian forest, in which we\r\nmay include the vegetation of the several subordinate periods into\r\nwhich this great era was divisible. The Devonian woods were probably,\r\nlike those of the succeeding carboniferous period, dense and dark,\r\ncomposed of but few species of plants, and these somewhat monotonous\r\nin appearance, and spreading out into broad swampy jungles,\r\nencroaching on the shallow bays and estuaries. Landing on one of these\r\nflats, we may first cast our eyes over a wide expanse, covered with\r\nwhat at a distance we might regard as reeds or rushes. But on a near\r\napproach they appear very different; rising in slender, graceful\r\nstems, they fork again and again, and their thin branches are sparsely\r\ncovered with minute needle-like leaves, while the young shoots curl\r\nover in graceful tresses, and the older are covered with little oval\r\nfruits, or spore-cases; for these plants are cryptogamous, or\r\nflowerless. This singular vegetation stretches for miles along the\r\nmuddy flats, and rises to a height of two or three feet from a knotted\r\nmass of cylindrical roots or root-stocks, twining like snakes through\r\nand over the soil. This plant may, according as we are influenced by\r\nits fruit or structure, be regarded as allied to the modern\r\nclub-mosses or the modern pill-worts. It is _Psilophyton_, in every\r\ncountry one of the most characteristic plants of the period, though,\r\nwhen imperfectly preserved, often relegated by careless and unskilled\r\nobservers to the all-engulfing group of fucoids. A little further\r\ninland we see a grove of graceful trees, forking like _Psilophyton_,\r\nbut of grander dimensions, and with the branches covered with linear\r\nleaves, and sometimes terminated by cones. These are _Lepidodendra_,\r\ngigantic club-mosses, which were developed to still greater\r\ndimensions in the coal period. Near these we may see a still more\r\ncurious tree, more erect in its growth, with rounded and somewhat\r\nrigid leaves and cones of different form, and with huge cable-like\r\nroots, penetrating the mud, and pitted with the marks of long\r\nrootlets. This is _Cyclostigma_, a plant near to the _Lepidodendron_,\r\nbut distinct, and peculiar to the Devonian. Some of its species attain\r\nto the dimensions of considerable trees; others are small and shrubby.\r\nAnother small tree, somewhat like the others, but with very long\r\nshaggy leaves, and its bark curiously marked with regular\r\ndiamond-shaped scars, is the _Leptophleum_. All these plants are\r\nprobably allied to our modern club-mosses, which are, however, also\r\nrepresented by some low and creeping species cleaving to the ground. A\r\nlittle further, and we reach a dense clump of _Sigillariæ_, with tall\r\nsparsely forking stems, and ribbed with ridges holding rows of\r\nleaf-scars a group of plants which we shall have further occasion to\r\nnotice in the coal formation; and here is an extensive jungle of\r\n_Calamites_, gigantic and overgrown mares'-tails, allies of the modern\r\nequisetums.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--VEGETATION OF THE DEVONIAN.\r\n\r\nTo the left are _Calamites_; next to these, _Leptophleum_; in the\r\ncentre are _Lepidodendron_, _Sigillaria_, and a Pine. Below are\r\n_Psilophyton_, _Cordaites_, Ferns, and _Asterophyllites_.]\r\n\r\nAmidst these trees, every open glade is filled with delicate ferns of\r\nmarvellous grace and beauty; and here and there a tree-fern rears its\r\nhead, crowned with its spreading and graceful leaves, and its trunk\r\nclad with a shaggy mass of aërial roots--an old botanical device, used\r\nin these ancient times, as well as now, to strengthen and protect the\r\nstems of trees not fitted for lateral expansion. Beyond this mass of\r\nvegetation, and rising on the slopes of the distant hills, we see\r\ngreat trees that look like pines. We cannot approach them more nearly;\r\nbut here on the margin of a creek we see some drift-trunks, that have\r\ndoubtless been carried down by a land flood. One of them is certainly\r\na pine, in form and structure of its wood very like those now living\r\nin the southern hemisphere; it is a _Dadoxylon_. Another is different,\r\nits sides rough and gnarled, and marked with huge irregular ridges;\r\nits wood loose, porous, and stringy, more like the bark of modern\r\npines, yet having rings of growth and a true bark of its own, and\r\nsending forth large branches and roots. It is the strange and\r\nmysterious _Prototaxites_, one of the wonders of the Devonian land,\r\nand whose leaves and fruits would be worth their weight in gold in our\r\nmuseums, could we only procure them. A solitary fragment further\r\nindicates that in the yet unpenetrated solitudes of the Devonian\r\nforests there may be other trees more like our ordinary familiar\r\nfriends of the modern woods; but of these we know as yet but little.\r\nWhat inhabitants have these forests? All that we yet know are a few\r\nlarge insects, relatives of our modern May-flies, flitting with broad\r\nveined wings over the stagnant waters in which their worm-like larvæ\r\ndwell, and one species at least assuming one of the properties of the\r\ngrasshopper tribe, and enlivening the otherwise silent groves with a\r\ncricket-like chirp, the oldest music of living things that geology as\r\nyet reveals to us; and this, not by the hearing of the sound itself,\r\nbut by the poor remains of the instrument attached to a remnant of a\r\nwing from the Devonian shales of New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nA remarkable illustration of the abundance of certain plants in the\r\nDevonian, and also of the slow and gradual accumulation of some of its\r\nbeds, is furnished by layers of fossil spore-cases, or the minute sacs\r\nwhich contain the microscopic germs of club-mosses and similar plants.\r\nIn the American forests, in spring, the yellow pollen-grains of\r\nspruces and pines sometimes drift away in such quantities in the\r\nbreeze that they fall in dense showers, popularly called showers of\r\nsulphur; and this vegetable sulphur, falling in lakes and ponds, is\r\ndrifted to the shore in great sheets and swathes. The same thing\r\nappears to have occurred in the Devonian, not with the pollen of\r\nflowering plants, but with the similar light spores and spore-cases of\r\nspecies of Lepidodendron and allied trees. In a bed of shale, at\r\nKettle Point, Lake Huron, from 12 to 14 feet thick, not only are the\r\nsurfaces of the beds dotted over with minute round spore-cases, but,\r\non making a section for the microscope, the substance of each layer is\r\nseen to be filled with them; and still more minute bodies, probably\r\nthe escaped spores, are seen to fill up their interstices. The\r\nquantity of these minute bodies is so great that the shale is\r\ncombustible, and burns with much flame. A bed of this nature must have\r\nbeen formed in shallow and still water, on the margin of an extensive\r\njungle or forest; and as the spore-cases are similar to those of the\r\nLepidodendra of the coal-measures, the trees were probably of this\r\nkind. Year after year, as the spores became ripe, they were wafted\r\naway, and fell in vast quantities into the water, to be mixed with the\r\nfine mud there accumulating. When we come to the coal period, we shall\r\nsee that such beds of spore-cases occur there also, and that they have\r\neven been supposed to be mainly instrumental in the accumulation of\r\ncertain beds of coal. Their importance in this respect may have been\r\nexaggerated, but the fact of their occurrence in immense quantities in\r\ncertain coals and shales is indisputable.\r\n\r\nThis is but a slender sketch of the Devonian forests: but we shall\r\nfind many of the same forms of plants in the carboniferous period\r\nwhich succeeds. With one thought we may close. We are prone to ask for\r\nreasons and uses for things, but sometimes we cannot be satisfied. Of\r\nwhat use were the Devonian forests? They did not, like those of the\r\ncoal formation, accumulate rich beds of coal for the use of man.\r\nExcept possibly a few insects, we know no animals that subsisted on\r\ntheir produce, nor was there any rational being to admire their\r\nbeauty. Their use, except as helping us in these last days to complete\r\nthe order of the vegetable kingdom as it has existed in geological\r\ntime, is a mystery. We can but fall back on that ascription of praise\r\nto Him \"who liveth for ever and ever,\" on the part of the heavenly\r\nelders who cast down their crowns before the throne and say, \"Thou art\r\nworthy, Lord, to receive the glory, and the honour, and the might;\r\nbecause Thou didst create all things, and by reason of _Thy will_ they\r\nare and were created.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE CARBONIFEROUS AGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat age of the world's history which, from its richness in\r\naccumulations of vegetable matter destined to be converted into coal,\r\nhas been named the Carboniferous, is in relation to living beings the\r\nmost complete and noble of the Palæozoic periods. In it those varied\r\narrangements of land and water which had been increasing in perfection\r\nin the previous periods, attained to their highest development. In it\r\nthe forms of animal and plant life that had been becoming more\r\nnumerous and varied from the Eozoic onward, culminated. The Permian\r\nwhich succeeded was but the decadence of the Carboniferous,\r\npreparatory to the introduction of a new order of things. Thus the\r\nCarboniferous was to the previous periods what the Modern is to the\r\npreceding Tertiary and Mesozoic ages the summation and completion of\r\nthem all, and the embodiment of their highest excellence. If the\r\nworld's history had closed with the Carboniferous, a naturalist,\r\nknowing nothing further, would have been obliged to admit that it had\r\nalready fulfilled all the promise of its earlier years. It is\r\nimportant to remember this, since we shall find ourselves entering on\r\nan entirely new scene in the Mesozoic period, and since this\r\ncharacter of the Carboniferous, as well as its varied conditions and\r\nproducts, may excuse us for dwelling on it a little longer then on the\r\nothers, On the other hand, the immense economic importance of the coal\r\nformation, and the interesting points connected with it, have made the\r\nCarboniferous more familiar to general readers then most other\r\ngeological periods, so that we may select points less common and\r\nwell-known for illustration. Popular expositions of geology are,\r\nhowever, generally so one-sided and so distorted by the prevalent\r\nstraining after effect, that the true aspect of this age is perhaps\r\nnot much better known then that of others less frequently described.\r\n\r\nLet us first consider the Carboniferous geography of the northern\r\nhemisphere; and in doing so we may begin with a fact concerning the\r\npreceding age. One of the most remarkable features of the Newer\r\nDevonian is the immense quantity of red rocks, particularly red\r\nsandstones, contained in it. Red sandstones, it is true, occur in\r\nolder formations, but comparatively rarely; their great head-quarters,\r\nboth in Europe and America, in so far as the Palæozoic is concerned,\r\nare in the Upper Devonian. Now red sandstone is an infallible mark of\r\nrapid deposition, and therefore of active physical change. If we\r\nexamine the grains of sand in a red sandstone, we shall find that they\r\nare stained or coated, externally, with the peroxide of iron, or iron\r\nrust; and that this coating, with perhaps a portion of the same\r\nsubstance in the intervening cement, is the cause of the colour. In\r\nfiner sandstones and red clays the same condition exists, though less\r\ndistinctly perceptible. Consequently, if red sands and clays are long\r\nabraded or scoured in water, or are subjected to any chemical agent\r\ncapable of dissolving the iron, they cease to be red, and resume their\r\nnatural grey or white colour. Now in nature, in addition to mechanical\r\nabrasion, there is a chemical cause most potent in bleaching red\r\nrocks, namely, the presence of vegetable or animal matter in a state\r\nof decay. Without entering into chemical details, we may content\r\nourselves with the fact that organic matter decaying in contact with\r\nperoxide of iron tends to take oxygen from it, and then to dissolve it\r\nin the state of protoxide, while the oxygen set free aids the decay.\r\nCarrying this fact with us, we may next affirm that iron is so\r\nplentiful in the crust of the earth that nearly all sands and clays\r\nwhen first produced from the weathering of rocks are stained with it,\r\nand that when this weathering takes place in the air, the iron is\r\nalways in the state of peroxide. More especially does this apply to\r\nthe greater number of igneous or volcanic rocks, which nearly always\r\nweather brown or red. Now premising that the original condition of\r\nsediment is that of being reddened with iron, and that it may lose\r\nthis by abrasion, or by the action of organic matter, it follows that\r\nwhen sand has been produced by decay of rocks in the air, and when it\r\nis rapidly washed into the sea and deposited there, red beds will\r\nresult. For instance, in the Bay of Fundy, whose rapid tides cut away\r\nthe red rocks of its shores and deposit their materials quickly, red\r\nmud and sand constitute the modern deposit. On the other hand, when\r\nthe red Band and mud are long washed about, their red matter may\r\ndisappear; and when the deposition is slow and accompanied with the\r\npresence of organic matter, the red colour is not only removed, but is\r\nreplaced by the dark tints due to carbon. Thus, in the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence, where red rocks similar to those of the Bay of Fundy are\r\nbeing more slowly wasted, and deposited in the presence of sea-weeds\r\nand other vegetable substances, the resulting sands and clays are\r\nwhite and grey or blackened in colour. An intermediate condition is\r\nsometimes observed, in which red beds are stained with grey spots and\r\nlines, where sea-weeds or land-plants have rested on them. I have\r\nspecimens of Devonian red shale with the forms of fern leaves, the\r\nsubstance of which has entirely perished, traced most delicately upon\r\nthem in greenish marks.\r\n\r\nIt follows from these facts that extensive and thick deposits of red\r\nbeds evidence sub-aërial decay of rocks, followed by comparatively\r\nrapid deposition in water, and that such red rocks will usually\r\ncontain few fossils, not only because of their rapid deposition, but\r\nbecause the few organic fragments deposited with them will probably\r\nhave been destroyed by the chemical action of the superabundant oxide\r\nof iron, which, so to speak, \"iron-moulds\" them, just as stains of\r\niron eat holes out of linen. Now when Sir Roderick Murchison tells us\r\nof 10,000 feet in thickness of red iron-stained rocks in the old red\r\nsandstone of England, we can see in this the evidence of rapid aqueous\r\ndeposition, going on for a very long time, and baring vast areas of\r\nformer land surface. Consequently we have proof of changes of level\r\nand immense and rapid denudation--a conclusion further confirmed by\r\nthe apparent unconformity of different members of the series to each\r\nother in some parts of the British Islands, the lower beds having been\r\ntilted up before the newer were deposited. Such was the state of\r\naffairs very generally at the close of the Devonian, and it appears to\r\nhave been accompanied with some degree of subsidence of the land,\r\nsucceeded by re-elevation at the beginning of the Carboniferous, when\r\nmany and perhaps large islands and chains of islands were raised out\r\nof the sea, along whose margins there were extensive volcanic\r\neruptions, evidenced by the dykes of trap traversing the Devonian, and\r\nthe beds of old lava interstratified in the lower part of the\r\nCarboniferous, where also the occurrence of thick beds of conglomerate\r\nor pebble-rock indicates the tempestuous action of the sea.\r\n\r\nBut a careful study of the Lower Carboniferous beds, where their\r\nmargins rest upon the islands of older rocks, shows great varieties in\r\nthese old shores. In some places there were shingly beaches; in\r\nothers, extensive sand-banks; in others, swampy flats clothed with\r\nvegetation, and sometimes bearing peaty beds, still preserved as small\r\nseams of coal. The bays and creeks swarmed with, fishes. A few\r\nsluggish reptiles crept along the muddy or sandy shores, and out\r\nsea-ward were great banks and reefs of coral and shells in the clear\r\nblue sea. The whole aspect of nature, taken in a general view, in the\r\nOlder Carboniferous period, must have much resembled that at present\r\nseen among the islands of the southern hemisphere. And the plants and\r\nanimals, though different, were more like those of the modern South\r\nPacific then any others now living.\r\n\r\nAs the age wore on, the continents were slowly lifted out of the\r\nwater, and the great continental plateaus were changed from coral seas\r\ninto swampy flats or low uplands, studded in many places with shallow\r\nlakes, and penetrated with numerous creeks and sluggish streams. In\r\nthe eastern continent these land surfaces prevailed extensively, more\r\nespecially in the west; and in America they spread both eastward and\r\nwestward from the Appalachian ridge, until only a long north and south\r\nMediterranean, running parallel to the Rocky Mountains, remained of\r\nthe former wide internal ocean. On this new and low land, comparable\r\nwith the \"Sylvas\" of the South American continent, flourished the\r\nwondrous vegetation of the Coal period, and were introduced the new\r\nland animals, whose presence distinguishes the close of the Palæozoic.\r\n\r\nAfter a vast lapse of time, in which only slow and gradual subsidence\r\noccurred, a more rapid settlement of the continental areas brought the\r\ngreater part of the once fertile plains of the coal formation again\r\nunder the waters; and shifting sand-banks and muddy tides engulfed and\r\nburied the remains of the old forests, and heaped on them a mass of\r\nsediment, which, like the weights of a botanical press, flattened and\r\ncompressed the vegetable _débris_ preserved in the leaves of the coal\r\nformation strata. Then came on that strange and terrible Permian\r\nperiod, which, like the more modern boulder-formation, marked the\r\ndeath of one age and the birth of another.\r\n\r\nThe succession just sketched is the normal one; but the terms in which\r\nit has been described show that it cannot be universal. There are many\r\nplaces in which the whole thickness of the Carboniferous is filled\r\nwith fossils of the land, and of estuaries and creeks. There are\r\nplaces, on the other hand, where the deep sea appears to have\r\ncontinued during the whole period. In America this is seen on the\r\ngrandest scale in the absence of the marine members along the western\r\nslopes of the Appalachians, and the almost exclusive prevalence of\r\nmarine beds in the far west, where the great Carboniferous\r\nMediterranean of America spread itself, and continued uninterruptedly\r\ninto the succeeding Permian period.\r\n\r\nIn our survey of the Carboniferous age, though there are peculiarities\r\nin the life of its older, middle, and newer divisions, we may take the\r\ngreat coal measures of the middle portion as the type of the land life\r\nof the period, and the great limestones of the lower portion as that\r\nof the marine life; and as the former is in this period by far the\r\nmost important, we may begin with it. Before doing so, however, to\r\nprevent misapprehension, it is necessary to remind the reader that the\r\nFlora of the Middle Coal Period is but one of a succession of related\r\nfloras that reach from the Upper Silurian to the Permian. The meagre\r\nflora of club-mosses and their allies in the Upper Silurian and Lower\r\nDevonian was succeeded by a comparatively rich and varied assemblage\r\nof plants in the Middle Devonian. The Upper Devonian was a period of\r\ndecadence, and in the Lower Carboniferous we have another feeble\r\nbeginning, presenting features somewhat different from those of the\r\nUpper Devonian. This was the time of the Culm of Germany, the Tweedian\r\nformation of the North of England and South of Scotland, and the Lower\r\nCoal formation of Nova Scotia. It was a period eminently rich in\r\nLepidodendra. It was followed by the magnificent flora of the Middle\r\nCoal formation, and then there was a time of decadence in the Upper\r\nCoal formation and only a slight revival in the Permian.\r\n\r\nIn the present condition of our civilization, coal is the most\r\nimportant product which the bowels of the earth afford to man. And\r\nthough there are productive beds of coal in most of the later\r\ngeological formations, down to the peats of the modern period, which\r\nare only unconsolidated coals, yet the coal of the Carboniferous age\r\nis the earliest valuable coal in point of time, and by far the most\r\nimportant in point of quantity. Mineral coal may be defined to be\r\nvegetable matter which has been buried in the strata of the earth's\r\ncrust, and there subjected to certain chemical and mechanical changes.\r\nThe proof of its vegetable origin will grow upon us as we proceed. The\r\nchemical changes which it has undergone are not very material. Wood or\r\nbark, taken as an example of ordinary vegetable matter, consists of\r\ncarbon or charcoal, with the gases hydrogen and oxygen. Coal has\r\nmerely parted with a portion of these ingredients in the course of a\r\nslow and imperfect putrefaction, so that it comes to have much less\r\noxygen and considerably less hydrogen then wood, and it has been\r\nblackened by the disengagement of a quantity of free carbon. The more\r\nbituminous flaming coals have a larger amount of residual hydrogen. In\r\nthe anthracite coals the process of carbonisation has proceeded\r\nfurther, and little remains but charcoal in a dense and compact form.\r\nIn cannel coals, and in certain bituminous shales, on the contrary,\r\nthe process seems to have taken place entirely under water, by which\r\nputrefaction has been modified, so that a larger proportion then usual\r\nof hydrogen has been retained. The mechanical change which the coal\r\nhas experienced consists in the flattening and hardening effect of the\r\nimmense pressure of thousands of feet of superincumbent rock, which\r\nhas crashed together the cell-walls of the vegetable matter, and\r\nreduced what was originally a pulpy mass of cellular tissue to the\r\ncondition of a hard laminated rock. To understand this, perhaps the\r\nsimplest way is to compare under the microscope a transverse section\r\nof recent pine-wood with a similar section of a pine trunk compressed\r\ninto brown coal or jet. In the one the tissue appears as a series of\r\nmeshes with thin woody walls and comparatively wide cavities for the\r\ntransmission of the sap. In the other the walls of the cells have been\r\nforced into direct contact, and in some cases have altogether lost\r\ntheir separate forms, and have been consolidated into a perfectly\r\ncompact structureless mass.\r\n\r\nWith regard to its mode of occurrence, coal is found in beds ranging\r\nin vertical thickness from less then an inch to more then thirty feet,\r\nand of wide horizontal extent. Many such beds usually occur in the\r\nthickness of the coal formation, or \"coal measures,\" as the miners\r\ncall it, separated from each other by beds of sandstone and compressed\r\nclay or shale. Very often the coal occurs in groups of several beds,\r\nsomewhat close to each other and separated from other groups by\r\n\"barren measures\" of considerable thickness. In examining a bed of\r\ncoal, where it is exposed in a cutting or shore cliff, we nearly\r\nalways find that the bed below it, or the \"underclay,\" as it is termed\r\nby miners, is a sort of fossil soil, filled with roots and rootlets.\r\nOn this rests the coal, which, when we examine it closely, is found to\r\nconsist of successive thin layers of hard coal of different qualities\r\nas to lustre and purity, and with intervening laminae of a dusty\r\nfibrous substance, like charcoal, called \"mother coal\" by miners, and\r\nsometimes mineral charcoal. Thin partings of dark shale also occur,\r\nand these usually present marks and impressions of the stems and\r\nleaves of plants. Above the coal is its \"roof\" of hardened clay or\r\nsandstone, and this generally holds great quantities of remains of\r\nplants, and sometimes large stumps of trees with their bark converted\r\ninto coal, and the hollow once occupied with wood filled with\r\nsandstone, while their roots spread over the surface of the coal. Such\r\nfossil forests of erect stumps are also found at various levels in the\r\ncoal measures, resting directly on under-clays without any coals. A\r\nbed of coal would thus appear to be a fossil bog or swamp.\r\n\r\nThis much being premised about the general nature of the sooty blocks\r\nwhich fill our coal-scuttles, we may now transport ourselves into the\r\nforests and bogs of the coal formation, and make acquaintance with\r\nthis old vegetation, while it still waved its foliage in the breeze\r\nand drank in the sunshine and showers. We are in the midst of one of\r\nthose great low plains formed by the elevation of the former sea bed.\r\nThe sun pours down its fervent rays upon us, and the atmosphere, being\r\nloaded with vapour, and probably more rich in carbonic acid then that\r\nof the present world, the heat is as it were accumulated and kept near\r\nthe surface, producing a close and stifling atmosphere like that of a\r\ntropical swamp. This damp and oppressive air is, however, most\r\nfavourable to the growth of the strange and grotesque trees which\r\ntower over our heads, and to the millions of delicate ferns and\r\nclub-mosses, not unlike those of our modern woods, which carpet the\r\nground. Around us for hundreds of miles spreads a dense and monotonous\r\nforest, with here and there open spaces occupied by ponds and sluggish\r\nstreams, whose edges are bordered with immense savannahs of reed-like\r\nplants, springing from the wet and boggy soil. Everything bespeaks a\r\nrank exuberance of vegetable growth; and if we were to dig downward\r\ninto the soil, we should find a thick bed of vegetable mould\r\nevidencing the prevalence of such conditions for ages. But the time\r\nwill come when this immense flat will meet with the fate which in\r\nmodern times befell a large district at the mouth of the Indus.\r\nQuietly, or with earthquake shocks, it will sink under the waters;\r\nfishes and mollusks will swarm where trees grew, beds of sand and mud\r\nwill be deposited by the water, inclosing and preserving the remains\r\nof the vegetation, and in some places surrounding and imbedding the\r\nstill erect trunks of trees. Many feet of such deposits may be formed,\r\nand our forest surface, with its rich bed of vegetable mould, has been\r\ncovered up and is in process of transformation into coal; while in\r\ncourse of time the shallow waters being filled up with deposit, or a\r\nslight re-elevation occurring, a new forest exactly like the last will\r\nflourish on the same spot. Such changes would be far beyond the\r\ncompass of the life even of a Methuselah; but had we lived in the Coal\r\nperiod, we might have seen all stages of these processes\r\ncontemporaneously in different parts of either of the great\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nBut let us consider the actual forms of vegetation presented to us in\r\nthe Coal period, as we can restore them from the fragments preserved\r\nto us in the beds of sandstone and shale, and as we would have seen\r\nthem in our imaginary excursion through the Carboniferous forests. To\r\ndo this we must first glance slightly at the great subdivisions of\r\nmodern plants, which we may arrange in such a way as to give an easy\r\nmeans for comparison of the aspects of the vegetable kingdom in\r\nancient and modern times. In doing this I shall avail myself of an\r\nextract from a previous publication of my own on this subject.\r\n\r\n\"The modern flora of the earth admits of a grand twofold division into\r\nthe _Phænogamous_, or flowering and seed-bearing plants, and the\r\n_Cryptogamous_, or flowerless and spore-bearing plants. In the former\r\nseries, we have, first, those higher plants which start in life with\r\ntwo seed-leaves, and have stems with distinct bark, wood, and\r\npith--the _Exogens_; secondly, those similar plants which begin life\r\nwith one seed-leaf only, and have no distinction of bark, wood, and\r\npith, in the stem--the _Endogens_; and, thirdly, a peculiar group\r\nstarting with two or several seed-leaves, and having a stem with bark,\r\nwood, and pith, but with very imperfect flowers, and wood of much\r\nsimpler structure then either of the others--the _Gymnosperms_. To the\r\nfirst of these groups or classes belong most of the ordinary trees of\r\ntemperate climates. To the second belong the palms and allied trees\r\nfound in tropical climates. To the third belong the pines and cycads.\r\nIn the second or Cryptogamous series we have also three classes,--(1.)\r\nThe _Acrogens_, or ferns and club-mosses, with stems having true\r\nvessels marked on the sides with cross-bars--the Scalariform vessels.\r\n(2.) The _Anophytes_, or mosses and their allies, with stems and\r\nleaves, but no vessels. (3.) The _Thallophytes_, or lichens, fungi,\r\nsea-weeds, etc., without true stems and leaves.\r\n\r\n\"In the existing climates of the earth we find these classes of plants\r\nvariously distributed as to relative numbers. In some, pines\r\npredominate. In others, palms and tree-ferns form a considerable part\r\nof the forest vegetation. In others, the ordinary exogenous trees\r\npredominate, almost to the exclusion of others. In some Arctic and\r\nAlpine regions, mosses and lichens prevail. In the Coal period we have\r\nfound none of the higher Exogens, though one species is known in the\r\nDevonian, and only a few obscure indications of the presence of\r\nEndogens; but Gymnosperms abound, and are highly characteristic. On\r\nthe other hand, we have no mosses or lichens, and very few algæ, but a\r\ngreat number of ferns and Lycopodiaceæ or club-mosses. Thus the coal\r\nformation period is botanically a meeting-place of the lower\r\nPhænogams and the higher Cryptogams, and presents many forms which,\r\nwhen imperfectly known, have puzzled botanists in regard to their\r\nposition in one or other series. In the present world, the flora most\r\nakin to that of the Coal period is that of moist and warm islands in\r\nthe southern hemisphere. It is not properly a tropical flora, nor is\r\nit the flora of a cold region, but rather indicative of a moist and\r\nequable climate. In accordance with this is the fact that the equable\r\nbut not warm climate of the southern hemisphere at present (which is\r\nowing principally to its small extent of land) enables sub-tropical\r\nplants to extend into high latitudes. In the Coal period this\r\nuniformity was evidently still more marked, since we find similar\r\nplants extending from regions within the Arctic circle to others near\r\nto the tropics. Still we must bear in mind that we may often be\r\nmistaken in reasoning as to the temperature required by extinct\r\nspecies of plants differing from those now in existence. Further, we\r\nmust not assume that the climatal conditions of the northern\r\nhemisphere were in the Coal period at all similar to those which now\r\nprevail. As Sir Charles Lyell has argued, a less amount of land in the\r\nhigher latitudes would greatly modify climates, and there is every\r\nreason to believe that in the Coal period there was less land then\r\nnow. It has been shown by Tyndall that a very small additional amount\r\nof carbonic acid in the atmosphere would, by obstructing the radiation\r\nof heat from the earth, produce almost the effect of a glass roof or\r\nconservatory, extending over the whole world. There is much in the\r\nstructure of the leaves of the coal plants, as well as in the vast\r\namount of carbon which they accumulated in the form of coal, and the\r\ncharacteristics of the animal life of the period, to indicate, on\r\nindependent grounds, that the Carboniferous atmosphere differed from\r\nthat of the present world in this way, or in the presence of more\r\ncarbonic acid--a substance now existing in the very minute proportion\r\nof one-thousandth of the whole by weight, a quantity adapted to the\r\npresent requirements of vegetable and animal life, but probably not to\r\nthose of the Coal period.\"\r\n\r\nReturning from this digression to the forests of the Coal period, we\r\nmay first notice that which is the most conspicuous and abundant tree\r\nin the swampy levels--the Sigillaria or seal-tree, so called from the\r\nstamp-like marks left by the fall of its leaves--a plant which has\r\ncaused much discussion as to its affinities. Some regard it as a\r\ngymnosperm, others as a cryptogam. Most probably we have under this\r\nname trees allied in part to both groups, and which, when better\r\nknown, may bridge over the interval between them. These trees present\r\ntall pillar-like trunks, often ribbed vertically with raised bands,\r\nand marked with rows of scars left by the fallen leaves. They are\r\nsometimes branchless, or divide at top into a few thick limbs, covered\r\nwith long rigid grass-like foliage. On their branches they bear long\r\nslender spikes of fruit, and we may conjecture that quantities of\r\nnut-like seeds scattered over the ground around their trunks are\r\ntheir produce. If we approach one of these trees closely, more\r\nespecially a young specimen not yet furrowed by age, we are amazed to\r\nobserve the accurate regularity and curious forms of the leaf-scars,\r\nand the regular ribbing, so very different from that of our ordinary\r\nforest trees. If we cut into its stem, we are still further astonished\r\nat its singular structure. Externally it has a firm and hard rind.\r\nWithin this is a great thickness of soft cellular inner bark,\r\ntraversed by large bundles of tough fibres. In the centre is a core or\r\naxis of woody matter very slender in proportion to the thickness of\r\nthe trunk, and still further reduced in strength by a large cellular\r\npith. Thus a great stem four or five feet in diameter is little else\r\nthen a mass of cellular tissue, altogether unfit to form a mast or\r\nbeam, but excellently adapted, when flattened and carbonised, to blaze\r\nupon our winter hearth as a flake of coal. The roots of these trees\r\nwere perhaps more singular then their stems; spreading widely in the\r\nsoft soil by regular bifurcation, they ran out in long snake-like\r\ncords, studded all over with thick cylindrical rootlets, which spread\r\nfrom them in every direction. They resembled in form, and probably in\r\nfunction, those cable-like root-stocks of the pond-lilies which run\r\nthrough the slime of lakes, but the structure of the rootlets was\r\nprecisely that of those of some modern Cycads. It was long before\r\nthese singular roots were known to belong to a tree. They were\r\nsupposed to be the branches of some creeping aquatic plant, and\r\nbotanists objected to the idea of their being roots; but at length\r\ntheir connection with Sigillaria was observed simultaneously by Mr.\r\nBinney, in Lancashire, and by Mr. Richard Brown, in Cape Breton, and\r\nit has been confirmed by many subsequently observed facts. This\r\nconnection, when once established, further explained the reason of the\r\nalmost universal occurrence of Stigmaria, as these roots were called,\r\nunder the coal beds; while trunks of the same plants were the most\r\nabundant fossils of their partings and roofs. The growth of successive\r\ngenerations of Sigillariæ was, in fact, found to be the principal\r\ncause of the accumulation of a bed of coal. Two species form the\r\ncentral figures in our illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--GROUP OF CARBONIFEROUS PLANTS, RESTORED FROM\r\nACTUAL SPECIMENS.\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Calamites (type of _C. Suckovii_). (_b_) Lepidofloios, or\r\n  Ulodendron. (_c_) Sigillaria (type of _S. reniformis_).\r\n  (_d_) (type of _S. elegans_). (_e_) Lepidodendron (type of\r\n  _L. corrugatum_). (_f_) Megaphyton (type of _M. magnificum_).\r\n  (_g_) Cordaites, or Pychnophyllum (type of _C. borassifolia_).]\r\n\r\nAlong with the trees last mentioned, we observe others of a more\r\ngraceful and branching form, the successors of those Lepidodendra\r\nalready noticed in the Devonian, and which still abound in the\r\nCarboniferous, and attain to larger dimensions then their older\r\nrelations, though they are certainly more abundant and characteristic\r\nin the lower portions of the carboniferous. Relatives, as already\r\nstated, of our modern club-mosses, now represented only by\r\ncomparatively insignificant species, they constitute the culmination\r\nof that type, which thus had attained its acme very long ago, though\r\nit still continues to exist under depauperated forms. They all\r\nbranched by bifurcation, sometimes into the most graceful and delicate\r\nsprays. They had narrow slender leaves, placed in close spirals on the\r\nbranches. They bore their spores in scaly cones. Their roots were\r\nsimilar to Stigmaria in general appearance, though differing in\r\ndetails. In the coal period there were several generic forms of these\r\nplants, all attaining to the dimensions of trees. Like the Sigillariæ,\r\nthey contributed to the materials of the coal; and one mode of this\r\nhas recently attracted some attention. It is the accumulation of their\r\nspores and spore-cases already referred to in speaking of the\r\nDevonian, and which was in the Carboniferous so considerable as to\r\nconstitute an important feature locally in some beds of coal. A\r\nsimilar modern accumulation of spore-cases of tree-ferns occurs in\r\nTasmania; but both in the Modern and the Carboniferous, such beds are\r\nexceptional; though wherever spore-cases exist as a considerable\r\nconstituent of coal, from their composition they give to it a highly\r\nbituminous character, an effect, however, which is equally produced by\r\nthe hard scales supporting the spores, and by the outer epidermal\r\ntissues of plants when these predominate in the coal, more especially\r\nby the thick corky outer bark of Sigillaria. In short, the corky\r\nsubstance of bark and similar vegetable tissues, from its highly\r\ncarbonaceous character, its indestructibility, and its difficult\r\npermeability by water carrying mineral matter in solution, is the best\r\nof all materials for the production of coal; and the microscope shows\r\nthat of this the principal part of the coal is actually composed.\r\n\r\nIn the wide, open forest glades, tree-ferns almost precisely similar\r\nto those of the modern tropics reared their leafy crowns. But among\r\nthem was one peculiar type, in which the fronds were borne in pairs\r\non opposite sides of the stem, leaving when they fell two rows of\r\nlarge horseshoe-shaped scars marking the sides of the trunk.\r\nBotanists, who have been puzzled with these plants almost as much as\r\nwith the Stigmaria, have supposed these scars to be marks of branches,\r\nof cones, and even of aërial roots; but specimens in my collection\r\nprove conclusively that the stem of this genus was a great caudex made\r\nup of the bases of two rows of huge leaves cemented together probably\r\nby intervening cellular tissue. As in the Devonian and in modern\r\ntimes, the stems of the tree-ferns of the Carboniferous strengthened\r\nthemselves by immense bundles of cord-like aërial roots, which look\r\nlike enormous fossil brooms, and are known under the name Psaronius.\r\n\r\nWe have only time to glance at the vast brakes of tall Calamites which\r\nfringe the Sigillaria woods, and stretch far sea-ward over tidal\r\nflats. They were allied to modern Mares' Tails or Equisetums, but were\r\nof gigantic size, and much more woody structure of stem. The Calamites\r\ngrew on wet mud and sand-flats, and also in swamps; and they appear to\r\nhave been especially adapted to take root in and clothe and mat\r\ntogether soft sludgy material recently deposited or in process of\r\ndeposition. When the seed or spore of a Calamite had taken root, it\r\nprobably produced a little low whorl of leaves surrounding one small\r\njoint, from which another and another, widening in size, arose,\r\nproducing a cylindrical stem, tapering to a point below. To\r\nstrengthen the unstable base, the lower joints, especially if the mud\r\nhad been accumulating around the plant, shot out long roots instead of\r\nleaves, while secondary stems grew out of the sides at the surface of\r\nthe soil, and in time there was a stool of Calamites, with tufts of\r\nlong roots stretching downwards, like an immense brush, into the mud.\r\nWhen Calamites thus grew on inundated flats, they would, by causing\r\nthe water to stagnate, promote the elevation of the surface by new\r\ndeposits, so that their stems gradually became buried; but this only\r\nfavoured their growth, for they continually pushed out new stems,\r\nwhile the old buried ones shot out bundles of roots instead of regular\r\nwhorls of leaves.\r\n\r\nThe Calamites, growing in vast fields along the margins of the\r\nSigillaria forests, must have greatly protected these from the effects\r\nof inundations, and by collecting the mud brought down by streams in\r\ntimes of flood, must have done much to prevent the intrusion of earthy\r\ndeposits among the vegetable matter. Their chief office, therefore, as\r\ncoal-producers, seems to have been to form for the Sigillaria forests\r\nthose reedy fringes which, when inundations took place, would exclude\r\nmud, and prevent that mixture of earthy matter in the coal which would\r\nhave rendered it too impure for use. Quantities of fragments of their\r\nstems can, however, be detected by the microscope in most coals.\r\n\r\nThe modern Mares' Tails have thin-walled hollow stems, and some of the\r\ngigantic calamites of the coal resembled them in this. But others, to\r\nwhich the name _Calamodendron_, or Reed-tree, has been given, had\r\nstems with thick woody walls of a remarkable structure, which, while\r\nsimilar in plan to that of the Mares' Tails, was much more perfect in\r\nits development. Professor Williamson has shown that there were forms\r\nintervening between these extremes; and thus in the calamites and\r\ncalamodendrons we have another example of the exaltation in ancient\r\ntimes of a type now of humble structure; or, in other words, of a\r\ncomprehensive type, low in the modern world, but in older periods\r\ntaking to itself by anticipation the properties afterward confined to\r\nhigher forms. The gigantic club-mosses of the Coal period constitute a\r\nsimilar example, and it is very curious that both of these types have\r\nbeen degraded in the modern world, though retaining precisely their\r\ngeneral aspect, while the tree-ferns contemporary with them in the\r\nPalæozoic still survive in all their original grandeur.\r\n\r\nBarely in the swampy flats, perhaps more frequently in the uplands,\r\ngrew great pines of several kinds; trees capable of doing as good\r\nservice for planks and beams as many of their modern successors, but\r\nwhich lived before their time, and do not appear even to have aided\r\nmuch in the formation of coal. These pines of the Coal-period seem to\r\nhave closely resembled some species still living in the southern\r\nhemisphere; and, like the ferns, they present to us a vegetable type\r\nwhich has endured through vast periods of time almost unchanged.\r\nIndeed, in the Middle Devonian we have pines almost as closely\r\nresembling those of the Modern world as do those of the Coal period.\r\nIt is in accordance with this long duration of the ferns and pines,\r\nthat they are plants now of world-wide distribution--suited to all\r\nclimates and stations. Capacity to exist under varied conditions is\r\nnear akin to capacity to survive cosmical changes. A botanist in the\r\nstrange and monstrous woods which we have tried to describe, would\r\nprobably have found many curious things among the smaller herbaceous\r\nplants, and might have gathered several precursors of the modern\r\nExogens and Endogens which have not been preserved to us as fossils,\r\nor are known only as obscure fragments. But incomplete though our\r\npicture necessarily is, and obscured by the dust of time, it may serve\r\nin some degree to render green to our eyes those truly primeval\r\nforests which treasured up for our long winter nights the Palæozoic\r\nsunshine, and established for us those storehouses of heat-giving\r\nmaterial which work our engines and propel our ships and carriages.\r\nTruly they lived not in vain, both as realizing for us a type of\r\nvegetation which otherwise we could not have imagined, and as\r\npreparing the most important of all the substrata of our modern arts\r\nand manufactures. In this last regard even the vegetable waste of the\r\nold coal swamps was most precious to us, as the means of producing the\r\nclay iron ores of the coal measures. I may close this notice of the\r\nCarboniferous forests with a suggestive extract from a paper by\r\nProfessor Huxley in the _Contemporary Review_:--\r\n\r\n\"Nature is never in a hurry, and seems to have had always before her\r\neyes the adage, 'Keep a thing long enough, and you will find a use for\r\nit.' She has kept her beds of coal for millions of years without being\r\nable to find much use for them; she has sent them down beneath the\r\nsea, and the sea-beasts could make nothing of them: she has raised\r\nthem up into dry land and laid the black veins bare, and still for\r\nages and ages there was no living thing on the face of the earth that\r\ncould see any sort of value in them; and it was only the other day, so\r\nto speak, that she turned a new creature oat of her workshop, who by\r\ndegrees acquired sufficient wits to make a fire, and then to discover\r\nthat the black rock would burn.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that nineteen hundred years ago, when Julius Cæsar was good\r\nenough to deal with Britain as we have dealt with New Zealand, the\r\nprimeval Briton, blue with cold and woad, may have known that the\r\nstrange black stone, of which he found lumps here and there in his\r\nwanderings, would burn, and so help to warm his body and cook his\r\nfood. Saxon, Dane, and Norman swarmed into the land. The English\r\npeople grew into a powerful nation, and Nature still waited for a\r\nreturn for the capital she had invested in the ancient club-mosses.\r\nThe eighteenth century arrived, and with it James Watt. The brain of\r\nthat man was the spore out of which was developed the steam-engine,\r\nand all the prodigious trees and branches of modern industry which\r\nhave grown out of this. But coal is as much an essential condition of\r\nthis growth and development as carbonic acid is for that of a\r\nclub-moss. Wanting the coal, we could not have smelted the iron needed\r\nto make our engines, nor have worked our engines when we had got them.\r\nBut take away the engines, and the great towns of Yorkshire and\r\nLancashire vanish like a dream. Manufactures give place to agriculture\r\nand pasture, and not ten men could live where now ten thousand are\r\namply supported.\r\n\r\n\"Thus all this abundant wealth of money and of vivid life is Nature's\r\ninvestment in club-mosses and the like so long ago. But what becomes\r\nof the coal which is burnt in yielding the interest? Heat comes out of\r\nit, light comes out of it, and if we could gather together all that\r\ngoes up the chimney and all that remains in the grate of a\r\nthoroughly-burnt coal fire, we should find ourselves in possession of\r\na quantity of carbonic acid, water, ammonia, and mineral matters,\r\nexactly equal in weight to the coal. But these are the very matters\r\nwith which Nature supplied the club-moss which made the coal. She is\r\npaid back principal and interest at the same time; and she straightway\r\ninvests the carbonic acid, the water, and the ammonia in new forms of\r\nlife, feeding with them the plants that now live. Thrifty Nature!\r\nsurely no prodigal, but most notable of housekeepers!\"\r\n\r\nAll this is true and admirably put. Its one weak point is the poetical\r\npersonification of Nature as an efficient planner of the whole. Such\r\nan imaginary goddess is a mere superstition, unknown alike to science\r\nand theology. Surely it is more rational to hold that the mind which\r\ncan utilize the coal and understand the manner of its formation, is\r\nitself made in the image and likeness of the Supreme Creative Spirit,\r\nin whom we live and move and have our being, who knows the end from\r\nthe beginning, whose power is the origin of natural forces, whose\r\nwisdom is the source of laws and correlations of laws, and whose great\r\nplan is apparent alike in the order of nature of the Palæozoic world\r\nand of the modern world, as well as in the relation of these to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn the Carboniferous, as in the Devonian age, insects existed, and in\r\ngreater numbers. The winged insects of the period, so far as known,\r\nbelong to three of the nine or ten orders into which modern insects\r\nare usually divided. Conspicuous among them are representatives of our\r\nwell-known domestic pests the cockroaches, which thus belong\r\ngeologically to a very old family. The Carboniferous roaches had not\r\nthe advantage of haunting our larders, but they had abundance of\r\nvegetable food in the rank forests of their time, and no doubt lived\r\nmuch as the numerous wild out-of-door species of this family now do.\r\nIt is, however, a curious fact that a group of insects created so long\r\nago, should prove themselves capable of the kind of domestication to\r\nwhich these creatures attain in our modern days; and that, had we\r\nlived even so far back as the coal period, we might have been liable\r\nto the attacks of this particular kind of pest. Another group,\r\nrepresented by many species in the coal forests, was that of the\r\nMay-flies and shad-flies, or ephemeras, which spend their earlier days\r\nunder water, feeding on vegetable matter, and affording food to many\r\nfresh-water fishes--a use which they no doubt served in the coal\r\nperiod also. Some of them were giants in their way, being probably\r\nseven inches in expanse of wing, and their larvæ must have been choice\r\nmorsels to the ganoid fishes, and would have afforded abundant bait\r\nhad there been anglers in those days. Another group of insects was\r\nthat of the weevils, a family of beetles, whose grubs must have found\r\nplenty of nuts and fruits to devour, without attracting the wrathful\r\nattentions of any gardener or orchardist.\r\n\r\nA curious and exceptional little group of creatures in the present\r\nworld is that of the galley-worms or millipedes; wingless,\r\nmany-jointed, and many-footed crawlers, resembling worms, but more\r\nallied to insects. These animals seem to have swarmed in the coal\r\nforests, and perhaps attained their maximum numbers and importance in\r\nthis period, though they still remain, a relic of an ancient\r\ncomprehensive type. I have myself found specimens referred by Mr.\r\nScudder, a most competent entomologist, to two genera and five\r\nspecies, in a few decayed fossil stumps in Nova Scotia, and several\r\nothers have been discovered in other parts of the world. It is not\r\nwonderful that animals like these, feeding on decayed vegetable\r\nmatter, should have flourished in the luxuriant Sigillaria swamps. A\r\nfew species of scorpions and spiders, very like those of the modern\r\nworld, have been found in the coal measures, both in Europe and\r\nAmerica; so that while we know of no enemy of the Devonian insects\r\nexcept the fishes, we know in addition to these in the Carboniferous\r\nthe spiders and their allies, and the smaller reptiles or batrachians\r\nto be noticed in the sequel. With reference to the latter, it is a\r\ncurious fact that one of the first fragments of a winged insect found\r\nin the coal-fields of America was a part of a head and some other\r\nremains contained in the coprolites or excrementitious matter of one\r\nof the smaller fossil reptiles. It is perhaps equally interesting that\r\nthis head shows one of the compound facetted eyes as perfectly\r\ndeveloped as those of any modern Neuropter, a group of insects\r\nremarkable even in the present world for their large and complex\r\norgans of vision. We may pause here to note that, just as in the\r\nPrimordial we already have the Trilobites presenting all the\r\nmodifications of which the type is susceptible, so in the\r\nCarboniferous we have in the case of the terrestrial articulates a\r\nsimilar fact--highly specialised forms like the beetles, the spiders,\r\nand the scorpions, already existing along with comprehensive forms\r\nlike the millipedes. Let us formulate the law of creation which the\r\nPrimordial trilobites, the Devonian fishes, and the Carboniferous\r\nclub-mosses and insects have taught us: it is, that every new type\r\nrapidly attains its maximum of development in magnitude and variety of\r\nforms, and then remains stationary, or even retrogrades, in\r\nsubsequent ages. We may connect this with other laws in the sequel.\r\n\r\nIn the coal measures we also meet, for the first time in our ascending\r\nprogress, the land snails so familiar now in every part of the world,\r\nand which are represented by two little species found in the coal\r\nformation of Nova Scotia. The figures of these must speak for\r\nthemselves; but the fact of their occurrence here and the mode of\r\ntheir preservation require some detailed mention. The great province\r\nof the Mollusks we have carried with us since we met with the Lingulæ\r\nin the Primordial, but all its members have been aquatic, and probably\r\nmarine. For the first time, in the Carboniferous period, snails emerge\r\nfrom the waters, and walk upon the ground and breathe air; for, like\r\nthe modern land snails, these creatures no doubt had air-sacks instead\r\nof gills. They come suddenly upon us--two species at once, and these\r\nrepresenting two distinct forms of the snail tribe, the elongated and\r\nthe rounded. They were very numerous. In the beds where they occur,\r\nprobably thousands of specimens, more or less perfect, could be\r\ncollected. Were they the first-born of land snails? It would be rash\r\nto affirm this, more especially since in all the coal-fields of the\r\nworld no specimens have been found except at one locality in Nova\r\nScotia;[N] and in all the succeeding beds we meet with no more till we\r\nhave reached a comparatively modern time. Yet it is very unlikely\r\nthat these creatures were in the coal period limited to one country,\r\nand that, after that period, they dropped out of existence for long\r\nages, and then reappeared. Still it may have been so.\r\n\r\n[N] Bradley has recently announced the discovery of other species in\r\nthe coal-field of Illinois.\r\n\r\nTHE TWO OLDEST LAND SNAILS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--_Pupa Vetusta_, Dawson.\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Natural size, (_b_) Enlarged, (_c_) Apex, enlarged,\r\n  (_d_) Sculpture, magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--_Conulus Priscus_, Carpenter.\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Specimen enlarged, (_b_) Sculpture, magnified.]\r\n\r\nThere are cases of geographical limitation quite as curious now. Here\r\nagain another peculiarity meets us. If these are really the oldest\r\nland snails, it is curious that they are so small,--so much inferior\r\nto many of their modern successors even in the same latitudes. The\r\nclimate of the coal period must have suited them, and there was plenty\r\nof vegetable food, though perhaps not the richest or most tender.\r\nThere is no excuse for them in their outward circumstances. Why, then,\r\nunlike so many other creatures, do they enter on existence in this\r\npoor and sneaking way. We must here for their benefit modify in two\r\nways the statement broadly made in a previous chapter, that new types\r\ncome in under forms of great magnitude. First, we often have, in\r\nadvance of the main inroad of a new horde of animals, a few\r\ninsignificant stragglers as a sort of prelude to the rest--precursors\r\nintimating beforehand what is to follow. We shall find this to be the\r\ncase with the little reptiles of the coal, and the little mammals of\r\nthe Trias, preceding the greater forms which subsequently set in.\r\nSecondly, this seems to be more applicable in the case of land animals\r\nthen in the case of those of the waters. To the waters was the fiat to\r\nbring forth living things issued. They have always kept to themselves\r\nthe most gigantic forms of life; and it seems as if new forms of life\r\nentering on the land had to begin in a small way and took more time to\r\nculminate.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances in which the first specimens of Carboniferous snails\r\nand gally-worms were found are so peculiar and so characteristic of\r\nthe coal formation, that I must pause here to notice them, and to make\r\nof them an introduction to the next group of creatures we have to\r\nconsider. In the coal formation in all parts of the world it is not\r\nunusual, as stated already in a previous page, to find erect trees or\r\nstumps of trees, usually Sigillariæ, standing where they grew; and\r\nwhere the beds are exposed in coast cliffs, or road cuttings, or\r\nmines, these fossil trees can be extracted from the matrix and\r\nexamined. They usually consist of an outer cylinder of coal\r\nrepresenting the outer bark, while the space within, once occupied by\r\nthe inner bark and wood, is filled with sandstone, sometimes roughly\r\narranged in layers, the lowest of which is usually mixed with coaly\r\nmatter or mineral charcoal derived from the fallen remains of the\r\ndecayed wood, a kind of deposit which affords to the fossil botanist\r\none of the best modes of investigating the tissues of these trees.\r\nThese fossil stumps are not uncommon in the roofs of the coal-seams.\r\nIn some places they are known to the miners as \"coal pipes,\" and are\r\ndreaded by them in consequence of the accidents which occur from their\r\nsuddenly falling after the coal which supported them has been removed.\r\nAn old friend and helper of mine in Carboniferous explorations had a\r\nlively remembrance of the fact that one of these old trees, falling\r\ninto the mine in which he was working, had crushed his leg and given\r\nhim a limp for life; and if he had been a few inches nearer to it\r\nwould have broken his back.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which such trees become fossilized may be explained as\r\nfollows:--Imagine a forest of Sigillariæ growing on a low flat. This\r\nbecomes submerged by subsidence or inundation, the soil is buried\r\nunder several feet of sand or mud, and the trees killed by this agency\r\nstand up as bare and lifeless trunks. The waters subside, and the\r\ntrees rapidly decay, the larvæ of wood-boring insects perhaps aiding\r\nin the process, as they now do in the American woods. The dense coaly\r\nouter bark alone resists decomposition, and stands as a hollow\r\ncylinder until prostrated by the wind or by the waters of another\r\ninundation, while perhaps a second forest or jungle has sprung up on\r\nthe new surface. When it falls, the part buried in the soil becomes an\r\nopen hole, with a heap of shreds of wood and bark in the bottom. Such\r\na place becomes a fit retreat for gally-worms and land-snails; and\r\nreptiles pursuing such animals, or pursued by their own enemies, or\r\nheedlessly scrambling among the fallen trunks, may easily fall into\r\nsuch holes and remain as prisoners. I remember to have observed, when\r\na boy, a row of post-holes dug across a pasture-field and left open\r\nfor a few days, and that in almost every hole one or two toads were\r\nprisoners. This was the fate which must have often befallen the\r\nsmaller reptiles of the coal forests in the natural post-holes left by\r\nthe decay of the Sigillariæ. Yet it may be readily understood that the\r\ncombination of circumstances which would effect this result must have\r\nbeen rare, and consequently this curious fact has been as yet observed\r\nonly in the coal formation of Nova Scotia; and in it only in one\r\nlocality, and in this in one only out of more then sixty beds in\r\nwhich erect trees have been found. But these hollow trees must be\r\nfilled up in order to preserve their contents; and as inundation and\r\nsubsequent decay have been the grave-diggers for the reptiles, so\r\ninundations filled up their graves with sand, to be subsequently\r\nhardened into sandstone, burying up at the same time the newer\r\nvegetation which had grown upon the former surface. The idea that\r\nsomething interesting might be found in these erect stumps, first\r\noccurred to Sir C. Lyell and the writer while exploring the beautiful\r\ncoast cliffs of Western Nova Scotia in 1851; and it was in examining\r\nthe fragments scattered on the beach that we found the bones of the\r\nfirst Carboniferous reptile discovered in America, and the shell of\r\nthe oldest known land snail.\r\n\r\nThese were not, however, the earliest known instances of Carboniferous\r\nreptiles. In 1841, Sir William Logan found footprints of a reptile at\r\nHorton Bluff, in Nova Scotia, in rocks of Lower Carboniferous age. In\r\n1844, Von Dechen found reptilian bones in the coal-field of Saarbruck;\r\nand in the same year Dr. King found reptilian footprints in the\r\nCarboniferous of Pennsylvania. Like Robinson Crusoe on his desert\r\nisland, we saw the footprints before we knew the animals that produced\r\nthem; and the fact that there were marks on a slab of shale or\r\nsandstone that must have been made by an animal walking on feet, was\r\nas clear and startling a revelation of the advent of a new and higher\r\nform of life, as were the footprints of Man Friday. Within the thirty\r\nyears since the discovery of the first slab of footprints, the\r\nknowledge of coal formation reptiles has grown apace. I can scarcely\r\nat present sum up exactly the number of species, but may estimate it\r\nat thirty-five at least. I must, however, here crave pardon of some of\r\nmy friends for the use of the word reptile. In my younger days frogs\r\nand toads and newts used to be reptiles; now we are told that they are\r\nmore like fishes, and ought to be called Batrachians or Amphibians,\r\nwhereas reptiles are a higher type, more akin to birds then to these\r\nlower and more grovelling creatures. The truth is, that the old class\r\nReptilia bridges over the space between the fishes and the birds, and\r\nit is in some degree a matter of taste whether we make a strong line\r\nat the two ends of it alone, or add another line in the middle. I\r\nobject to the latter course, however, in the period of the world's\r\nhistory of which I am now writing, since I am sure that there were\r\nanimals in those days which were batrachians in some points and true\r\nreptiles in others; while there are some of them in regard to which it\r\nis quite uncertain whether they are nearer to the one group or the\r\nother. Although, therefore, naturalists, with the added light and\r\npenetration which they obtain by striding on to the Mesozoic and\r\nModern periods, may despise my old-fashioned grovellers among the mire\r\nof the coal-swamps, I shall, for convenience, persist in calling them\r\nreptiles in a general way, and shall bring out whatever claims I can\r\nto justify this title for some of them at least.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most fish-like of the whole are the curious creatures from\r\nthe coal measures of Saarbruck, first found by Yon Dechen, and which\r\nconstitute the genus _Archegosaurus_. Their large heads, short necks,\r\nsupports for permanent gills, feeble limbs, and long tails for\r\nswimming, show that they were aquatic creatures presenting many points\r\nof resemblance to the ganoid fishes with which they must have\r\nassociated; still they were higher then these in possessing lungs and\r\ntrue feet, though perhaps better adapted for swimming then even for\r\ncreeping.\r\n\r\nFrom these creatures the other coal reptiles diverge, and ascend along\r\ntwo lines of progress, the one leading to gigantic crocodile-like\r\nanimals provided with powerful jaws and teeth, and probably haunting\r\nthe margins of the waters and preying on fishes; the other leading to\r\nsmall and delicate lizard-like species, with well-developed limbs,\r\nlarge ribs, and ornate horny scales and spines, living on land and\r\nfeeding on insects and similar creatures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--RESTORATIONS OF BAPHETES, DENDRERPETON.\r\nHYLONOMUS, AND HYLERPETON, WITH CARBONIFEROUS PLANTS IN THE DISTANCE.]\r\n\r\nIn the first direction we have a considerable number of species found\r\nin the Jarrow coal-field in Ireland, and described by Professor\r\nHuxley. Some of them were like snakes in their general form, others\r\nmore like lizards. Still higher stand such animals as _Baphetes_ and\r\n_Eosaurus_ from the Nova Scotia coal-field and _Anthracosaurus_ from\r\nthat of Scotland. The style and habits of these creatures it is easy\r\nto understand, however much haggling the comparative anatomists may\r\nmake over their bones. They were animals of various size, ranging\r\nfrom a foot to at least ten feet in length, the body generally\r\nlizard-like in form, with stout limbs and a flattened tail useful in\r\nswimming. Their heads were flat, stout, and massive, with large teeth,\r\nstrengthened by the insertion and convolution of plates of enamel. The\r\nfore limbs were probably larger then the hind limbs, the better to\r\nenable them to raise themselves out of the water. The belly was\r\nstrengthened by bony plates and closely imbricated scales, to resist,\r\nperhaps, the attacks of fishes from beneath, and to enable them\r\nwithout injury to drag their heavy bodies over trunks of trees and\r\nbrushwood, whether in the water or on the land. Their general aspect\r\nand mode of life were therefore by no means unlike those of modern\r\nalligators; and in the vast swamps of the coal measures, full of ponds\r\nand sluggish streams swarming with fish, such creatures must have\r\nfound a most suitable habitat, and probably existed in great numbers,\r\nbasking on the muddy banks, surging through the waters, and filling\r\nthe air with their bellowings. The most curious point about these\r\ncreatures is, that while rigid anatomy regards them as allied in\r\nstructure more to frogs and toads and newts then to true lizards, it\r\nis obvious to common sense that they were practically crocodiles; and\r\neven anatomy must admit that their great ribs and breastplates, and\r\npowerful teeth and limbs, indicate a respiration, circulation, and\r\ngeneral vitality, quite as high as those of the proper reptiles.\r\nHence, it happens that very different views are stated as to their\r\naffinities; questions into which we need not now enter, satisfied with\r\nthe knowledge of the general appearance and mode of life of these\r\nharbingers of the reptilian life of the succeeding geological periods.\r\n\r\nIn the other direction, we find several animals of small size but\r\nbetter developed limbs, leading to a group of graceful little\r\ncreatures, quite as perplexing with regard to affinities as those\r\nfirst mentioned, but tending towards the smaller lizards of the\r\nmodern world. At the top of these I may place the genus _Hylonomus_\r\nfrom hollow fossil trees of Nova Scotia, of which two species are\r\nrepresented as restored in our illustration. In these restorations I\r\nhave adhered as faithfully as possible to the proportions of parts as\r\nseen in my specimens. Imagine a little animal six or seven inches\r\nlong, with small short head, not so flat as those of most lizards, but\r\nwith a raised fore-head, giving it an aspect of some intelligence. Its\r\ngeneral form is that of a lizard, but with the hind feet somewhat\r\nlarge, to aid it in leaping and standing erect, and long and flexible\r\ntoes. Its belly is covered with bony scales, its sides with bright and\r\nprobably coloured scale armour of horny consistency, and its neck and\r\nback adorned with horny crests, tubercles, and pendants. It runs,\r\nleaps, and glides through the herbage of the coal forests, intent on\r\nthe pursuit of snails and insects, its eye glancing and its bright\r\nscales shining in the sun. This is a picture of the best known species\r\nof Hylonomus drawn from the life. Yet the anatomist, when he examines\r\nthe imperfectly-ossified joints of its backbone, and the double joint\r\nat the back of its skull, will tell you that it is after all little\r\nbetter then a mere newt, an ass in a lion's skin, a jackdaw with\r\nborrowed feathers, and that it has no right to have fine scales, or to\r\nbe able to run on the land. It may be so; but I may plead in its\r\nbehalf, that in the old coal times, when reptiles with properly-made\r\nskeletons had not been created, the next best animals may have been\r\nentitled to wear their clothes and to assume their functions as well.\r\nIn short, functionally or officially, our ancient batrachians were\r\nreptiles; in point of rank, as measured by type of skeleton, they\r\nbelonged to a lower grade. To this view of the case I think most\r\nnaturalists will agree, and they will also admit that the progress of\r\nour views has been in this direction, since the first discovery of\r\nCarboniferous air-breathing vertebrates. In evidence of this I may\r\nquote from Professor Huxley's description of his recently found\r\nspecies,[O] After noticing the prevalent views that the coal reptiles\r\nwere of low organization, he says: \"Discoveries in the Nova Scotia\r\ncoal-fields first shook this view, which ceased to be tenable when the\r\ngreat _Anthracosaurus_ of the Scotch coal-field was found to have\r\nwell-ossified biconcave vertebrae.\"\r\n\r\n[O] _Geological Magazine_, vol. iii.\r\n\r\nThe present writer may, however, be suspected of a tendency to extend\r\nforms of life backward in time, since it has fallen to his lot to be\r\nconcerned in this process of stretching backward in several cases. He\r\nhas named and described the oldest known animal. He has described the\r\noldest true exogen, and the oldest known pine-tree. He was concerned\r\nin the discovery of the oldest known land snails, and found the oldest\r\nmillipedes. He has just described the oldest bituminous bed composed\r\nof spore-cases, and he claims that his genus Hylonomus includes the\r\noldest animals which have a fair claim to be considered reptiles.\r\nStill this discovery of old things comes rather of fortune and careful\r\nsearch then of a desire to innovate; and a distinction should be drawn\r\nbetween that kind of novelty which consists in the development of new\r\ntruths, and that which consists in the invention of new fancies, or\r\nthe revival of old ones. There is too much of this last at present;\r\nand it would be a more promising line of work for our younger\r\nnaturalists, if they would patiently and honestly question nature,\r\ninstead of trying to extort astounding revelations by throwing her on\r\nthe rack of their own imaginations.\r\n\r\nWe may pause here a moment to contemplate the greatness of the fact we\r\nhave been studying the introduction into our world of the earliest\r\nknown vertebrate animals which could open their nostrils and literally\r\n\"breathe the breath of life.\" All previous animals that we know,\r\nexcept a few Devonian insects, had respired in the water by means of\r\ngills or similar apparatus, Now we not only have the little land\r\nsnails, with their imperfect substitutes for lungs, but animals which\r\nmust have been able to draw in the vital air into capacious chambered\r\nlungs, and with this power must have enjoyed a far higher and more\r\nactive style of vitality; and must have possessed the faculty of\r\nuttering truly vocal sounds. What wondrous possibilities unknown to\r\nthese creatures, perhaps only dimly perceived by such rational\r\nintelligences as may have watched the growth of our young world, were\r\nimplied in these gifts. It is one of the remarkable points in the\r\nhistory of creation in Genesis, that this step of the creative work is\r\nemphatically marked. Of all the creatures we have noticed up to this\r\npoint, it is stated that God said, \"Let the waters bring them\r\nforth\"--but it is said that \"God created\" great reptiles\r\n(_tanninim_).[P] No doubt these \"great tanninim\" culminate in the\r\nsucceeding Mesozoic age, but their first introduction dates as far\r\nback as the Carboniferous; and this introduction was emphatically a\r\ncreation, as being the commencement of a new feature among living\r\nbeings. What further differences may be implied in the formulæ, \"Let\r\nthe waters produce\" and \"God created,\" we do not know; very probably\r\nhe who wrote the words did not fully know. But if we could give a\r\nscientific expression to this difference, and specify the cases to\r\nwhich its terms apply, we might be able to solve one of the most vexed\r\nquestions of biology.\r\n\r\n[P] Not \"whales,\" as in our version.\r\n\r\nLet us observe, however, that even here, where, if anywhere, we have\r\nactual creation, especial pains are taken to bridge over the gap, and\r\nto prevent any appearance of discontinuity in the work. The ganoid\r\nfishes of the coal period very probably had, like their modern\r\ncongeners, well-developed air-bladders, serving to some extent, though\r\nvery imperfectly, as lungs. The humbler and more aquatic reptiles of\r\nthe period retained the gills, and also some of the other features of\r\nthe fishes; so that, like some modern creatures of their class, they\r\nstood, as to respiration, on two stools, and seemed unwilling\r\naltogether to commit themselves to the new mode of life in the\r\nuncongenial element of air. Even the larger and more lizard-like of\r\nthe coal reptiles may--though this we do not certainly know, and in\r\nsome cases there are reasons for doubting it--have passed the earliest\r\nstage of their lives in the water as gilled tadpoles, in the manner of\r\nour modern frogs. Thus at the very point where one of the greatest\r\nadvances of animal life has its origin, we have no sudden stop, but an\r\ninclined plane; and yet, as I have elsewhere endeavoured to show by\r\narguments which cannot be repeated here,[Q] we have not a shadow of\r\nreason to conclude that, in the coal period, fishes were transmuted\r\ninto reptiles.\r\n\r\n[Q] \"Air-breathers of the Coal Period,\" p. 77.\r\n\r\nBut the reader may be wearied with our long sojourn in the\r\npestilential atmosphere of the coal swamps, and in the company of\r\ntheir low-browed and squalid inhabitants. Let us turn for a little to\r\nthe sea, and notice the animal life of the great coral reefs and shell\r\nbeds preserved for us in the Carboniferous limestone. Before doing so,\r\none point merits attention. The coal formation for the first time\r\ndistinctly presents to us the now familiar differences in the\r\ninhabitants of the open sea and those of creeks, estuaries and lakes.\r\nSuch distinctions are unknown to us in the Silurian. There all is sea.\r\nThey begin to appear in the Devonian, in the shallow fish-banks and\r\nthe Anodon-like bivalves found with fossil plants. In the coal period\r\nthey become very manifest. The animals found in the shales with the\r\ncoal are all, even the aquatic ones, distinct from those of the open\r\nseas of the period. Some of them may have lived in salt or brackish\r\nwater, but not in the open sea. They are creatures of still and\r\nshallow waters. It is true that in some coal-fields marine beds occur\r\nin the coal measures with their characteristic fossils, but these are\r\nquite distinct from the usual animal remains of the coal-fields, and\r\nmark occasional overflows of the sea, owing to subsidence of the land.\r\nIt is important to notice this geographical difference, marking the\r\ngreater specialisation and division of labour, if we may so speak,\r\nthat was in the process of introduction.\r\n\r\nThe sea of the Carboniferous period presented in the main similar\r\ngreat groups of animals to those of the Devonian, represented however\r\nby different species. We may notice merely some of the salient points\r\nof resemblance or difference. The old types of corals continue in\r\ngreat force; but it is their last time, for they rapidly decay in the\r\nsucceeding Permian and disappear. The Crinoids are as numerous and\r\nbeautiful as in any other period, and here for the first time we meet\r\nwith the new and higher type of the sea-urchin, in large and beautiful\r\nspecies. One curious group, that of the _Pentremites_, a sort of\r\nlarval form, is known here alone. Among the lamp-shells we may note,\r\nas peculiarly and abundantly Carboniferous, those with one valve very\r\nconvex and the other very concave and anchored in the mud by long\r\nspines instead of a peduncle attached to stones and rocks.[R] There\r\nare many beautiful shells allied to modern scallops, and not a few\r\nsea-snails of various sorts. The grand _Orthoceratites_ of the\r\nSilurian diminish in size preparatory to their disappearance in the\r\nPermian, and the more modern type of _Nautilus_ and its allies becomes\r\nprevalent. Among the Crustaceans we may notice the appearance of the\r\n_Limulus_, or king-crab, of which the single little species described\r\nby Woodward from the Upper Silurian may be regarded as merely a\r\nprophecy. It is curious that the Carboniferous king-crabs are very\r\nsmall, apparently another case of a new form appearing in humble\r\nguise; but as the young of modern king-crabs haunt creeks and swampy\r\nflats, while the adults live in the sea, it may be that only the young\r\nof the Carboniferous species are yet known to us, the specimens found\r\nbeing mostly in beds likely to be frequented by the young rather then\r\nby the full-grown individuals.\r\n\r\n[R] The Productidæ.\r\n\r\nThe old order of the Trilobites, which has accompanied us from\r\nPrimordial times, here fails us, and a few depauperated species alone\r\nremain, the sole survivors of their ancient race--small, unornamented,\r\nand feeble representatives of a once numerous and influential tribe.\r\nHow strange that a group of creatures so numerous and apparently so\r\nwell adapted to conditions of existence which still continue in the\r\nsea, should thus die out, while the little bivalved crustaceans, which\r\nbegan life almost as far back and lived on the same sea-floors with\r\nthe Trilobites, should still abound in all our seas; and while the\r\nking-crabs, of precisely similar habits with the Trilobites, should\r\napparently begin to prosper. Equally strange is the fate of the great\r\nswimming Eurypterids which we saw in the Devonian. They also continue,\r\nbut in diminished force, in the Carboniferous, and there lay down for\r\never their well-jointed cuirasses and formidable weapons, while a few\r\nlittle shrimp-like creatures, their contemporaries, form the small\r\npoint of the wedge of our great tribes of squillas and crabs and\r\nlobsters. Some years ago the late lamented palæontologist, Salter, a\r\nman who scarcely leaves his equal in his department, in conjunction\r\nwith Mr. Henry Woodward, prepared a sort of genealogical chart of the\r\nCrustacea on which these facts are exhibited. Some new species have\r\nsince been discovered, and a little additional light about affinities\r\nhas been obtained; but taken as it stands, the history of the\r\nCrustacea as there shown in one glance, has in it more teaching on the\r\nphilosophy of creation then I have been able to find in many ponderous\r\nquartos of tenfold its pretensions. Had Salter been enabled, with the\r\naid of other specialists like Woodward, to complete similar charts of\r\nother classes of invertebrate animals, scientific palaeontology in\r\nEngland would have been further advanced then it is likely to be in\r\nthe next ten years.\r\n\r\nTo return to our Trilobites: one of the most remarkable points in\r\ntheir history is their appearance in full force in the Primordial. In\r\nthese rocks we have some of the largest in size--some species of\r\nParadoxides being nearly two feet long, and some of the very smallest.\r\nWe have some with the most numerous joints, others with the fewest;\r\nsome with very large tails, others with very small; some with no\r\nornamentation, others very ornate; some with large eyes, others with\r\nnone that have been made out, though it is scarcely probable that they\r\nwere wholly blind. They increased in numbers and variety through the\r\nSilurian and Devonian, and then suddenly drop off at the end of the\r\nLower Carboniferous. Throughout their whole term of existence they\r\nkept rigidly to that type of the mud-plough which the king-crab still\r\nretains, and which renders the anterior extremity so different from\r\nthat of the ordinary Crustacea. They constitute one of the few cases\r\nin which we seem to see before us the whole history of an animal type;\r\nand the more we look into that history, the more do we wonder at their\r\ninscrutable introduction, the unity and variety mingled in their\r\nprogress, and their strange and apparently untimely end. I have\r\nalready referred (page 95) to the use which Barrande makes of this as\r\nan argument against theories of evolution; but must refer to his work\r\nfor the details.\r\n\r\nOne word more I must say before leaving their graves. I have reason to\r\nbelieve that they were not only the diggers of the burrows, and of\r\nthe ladder-tracks and pitted tracks[S] of the Silurian and\r\nPrimordial, but that with the strokes of their rounded or spinous\r\ntails, the digging of their snouts, and the hoe-work of their hard\r\nupper lips, or Hypostomes, they made nearly all those strange marks in\r\nthe Primordial mud which have been referred to fucoids, and even to\r\nhigher plants. The Trilobites worked over all the mud bottoms of the\r\nPrimordial, even in places where no remains of them occur, and the\r\npeculiarities of the markings which they left are to be explained only\r\nby a consideration of the structures of individual species.\r\n\r\n[S] _Climactichnites_ and _Protichnites_.\r\n\r\nI had almost lost sight of the fishes of the Carboniferous period, but\r\nafter saying so much of those of the Devonian, it would be unfair to\r\nleave their successors altogether unnoticed. In the Carboniferous we\r\nlose those broad-snouted plate-covered species that form so\r\nconspicuous a feature in the Devonian; and whatever its meaning, it is\r\nsurely no accident that these mud-burrowing fishes should decay along\r\nwith those crustacean mud-burrowers, the Trilobites. But swarms of\r\nfishes remain, confined, as in the Devonian, wholly to the two orders\r\nof the Gar-fishes (_Ganoids_) and the sharks (_Placoids_). In the\r\nformer we have a multitude of small and beautiful species haunting the\r\ncreeks and ponds of the coal swamps, and leaving vast quantities of\r\ntheir remains in the shaly and even coaly beds formed in such places.\r\nSuch were the pretty, graceful fishes of the genera _Palæoniscus_ and\r\n_Amblypterus_. Pursuing and feeding on these were larger ganoids,\r\narmed with strong bony scales, and formidable conical or sharp-edged\r\nteeth. Of these were _Rhizodus_ and _Acrolepis_. There were besides\r\nmultitudes of sharks whose remains consist almost wholly of their\r\nteeth and spines, their cartilaginous skeletons having perished. One\r\ngroup was allied to the few species of modern sharks whose mouths are\r\npaved with flat teeth for crushing shells. These were the most\r\nabundant sharks of the Carboniferous--slow and greedy monsters,\r\nhaunting shell banks and coral reefs, and grinding remorselessly all\r\nthe shell-fishes that came in their way. There were also sharks\r\nfurnished with sharp and trenchant teeth, which must have been the\r\nfoes of the smaller mailed fishes, pursuing them into creeks and muddy\r\nshallows; and if we may judge from the quantity of their remains in\r\nsome of these places, sometimes perishing in their eager efforts. On\r\nthe whole, the fishes of the Carboniferous were, in regard to their\r\ngeneral type, a continuation of those of the Devonian, but the sharks\r\nand the scaly ganoids were relatively more numerous. They differed\r\nfrom our modern fishes in the absence of the ordinary horny-scaled\r\ntype to which all our more common fishes belong, and in the prevalence\r\nof that style of tail which has been termed \"heterocercal,\" in which\r\nthe continuation of the backbone forms the upper lobe of the tail, a\r\nstyle which, if we may judge from modern examples, gives more power of\r\nupward and downward movement, and is especially suitable to fishes\r\nwhich search for food only at the bottom, or only above the surface of\r\nthe waters.\r\n\r\nMost reluctantly I must here leave one of the most remarkable periods\r\nof the world's history, and reserve to our next chapter the summation\r\nof the history of the older world of life in its concluding stage, the\r\nPermian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE PERMIAN AGE AND CLOSE OF THE PALÆOZOIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe immense swamps and low forest-clad plains which occupied the\r\ncontinental areas of the Northern Hemisphere, and which we now know\r\nextended also into the regions south of the equator, appear at the\r\nclose of the Carboniferous age to have again sunk beneath the waves,\r\nor to have relapsed into the condition of sand and gravel banks; for a\r\ngreat thickness of such deposits rests on the coal measures and\r\nconstitutes the upper coal formation, the upper \"barren measures\" of\r\nthe coal-miners. There is something grand in the idea of this\r\nsubsidence of a world of animal and vegetable life beneath the waters.\r\nThe process was very slow, so slow that at first vegetable growth and\r\ndeposition of silt kept pace with it; and this is the reason of the\r\nimmense series of deposits, in some places nearly 15,000 feet thick,\r\nwhich inclose or rest upon the coal beds; but at length it became more\r\nrapid, so that forests and their inhabitants perished, and the wild\r\nsurf drifted sand and pebbles over their former abodes. So the\r\nCarboniferous world, like that of Noah, being overflowed with water,\r\nperished. But it was not a wicked world drowned for its sins, but\r\nmerely an old and necessarily preliminary system, which had fully\r\nserved its purpose; and, like the stubble of last year, must be\r\nturned under by the plough that it may make way for a new verdure. The\r\nplough passed over it, and the winter of the Permian came, and then\r\nthe spring of a new age.\r\n\r\nThe Permian and the succeeding Triassic are somewhat chilly and\r\ndesolate periods of the earth's history. The one is the twilight of\r\nthe Palæozoic day, the other is the dawn of the Mesozoic. Yet to the\r\nphilosophical geologist no ages excel them in interest. They are times\r\nof transition, when old dynasties and races pass away and are replaced\r\nby new and vigorous successors, founding new empires and introducing\r\nnew modes of life and action.\r\n\r\nThree great leading points merit our attention in entering on the\r\nPermian age. The first is the earth-movements of the period. The\r\nsecond is the resulting mineral characteristics of the deposits\r\nformed. The third is the aspect of the animal and vegetable life of\r\nthis age in their relation more especially to those which preceded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM OF FOLDINGS OF THE CRUST IN THE PERMIAN PERIOD.\r\n(The vertical scale of heights and depressions exaggerated more then\r\nsix times.) The lower figure shows a portion of folded strata in the\r\nAppalachians--after Rogers.]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the first point above named, the earth's crust was\r\nsubjected in the Permian period to some of the grandest movements\r\nwhich have occurred in the whole course of geologic time, and we can\r\nfix the limits of these, in Europe and America at least, with some\r\ndistinctness. If we examine the Permian rocks in England and Germany,\r\nwe shall find that everywhere they lie on the upturned edges of the\r\npreceding Carboniferous beds. In other words, the latter have been\r\nthrown into a series of folds, and the tops of these folds have been\r\nmore or less worn away before the Permian beds were placed on them.\r\nBut if we pass on to the eastward, in the great plain between the\r\nVolga and the Ural mountains, where, in the \"ancient kingdom of Perm,\"\r\nthe greatest known area of these rocks is found, an area equal in\r\nextent to twice that of France, and which Sir R. I. Murchison, who\r\nfirst proposed the name, took as the typical district, we find, on the\r\ncontrary, that the Permian and Carboniferous are conformable to one\r\nanother. If now we cross the Atlantic and inquire how the case stands\r\nin America, we shall find it precisely the same. Here the great\r\nsuccession of earth-waves constituting the Appalachian Mountains rises\r\nabruptly at the eastern edge of the continent, and becomes flatter and\r\nflatter, until, in the broad plains west of the Mississippi, the\r\nPermian beds appear, as in Russia, resting upon the Carboniferous so\r\nquietly that it is not always easy to draw a line of separation\r\nbetween them. As Dana has remarked, we find at the western side of\r\nEurope and the eastern side of America, great disturbances\r\ninaugurating the Permian period; and in the interior of both, in the\r\nplains between the Volga and the Ural in one, and between the\r\nMississippi and Rocky Mountains in the other, an entire absence of\r\nthese disturbances. The main difference is, that in eastern America\r\nthe whole Carboniferous areas have apparently been so raised up that\r\nno Permian was deposited on them, while in Europe considerable patches\r\nof the disturbed areas became or remained submerged. Another American\r\ngeologist has largely illustrated the fact that the movements which\r\nthrew up the Appalachian folds were strongest to the eastward, and\r\nthat the ridges of rock are steepest on their west sides, the force\r\nwhich caused them acting from the direction of the sea. It seems as if\r\nthe Atlantic area had wanted elbow-room, and had crushed up the edges\r\nof the continents next to it. In other words, in the lapse of the\r\nPalæozoic ages the nucleus of the earth had shrunk away from its\r\ncoating of rocky layers, which again collapsed into great wrinkles.\r\n\r\nSuch a process may seem difficult of comprehension. To understand it\r\nwe must bear in mind some of its conditions. First, the amount of this\r\nwrinkling was extremely small relatively to the mass of the earth. In\r\nthe diagram on page 162 it is greatly exaggerated, yet is seen to be\r\nquite insignificant, however gigantic in comparison with microscopic\r\nweaklings like ourselves. Secondly, it was probably extremely slow.\r\nBeds of solid rock cannot be suddenly bent into great folds without\r\nbreaking, and the abruptness of some of the folds may be seen from our\r\nfigure, copied from Rogers (page 162), of some of the foldings of the\r\nAppalachian Mountains. Thirdly, the older rocks below the\r\nCarboniferous and the Devonian must have been in a softened and\r\nplastic state, and so capable of filling up the vacancies left by the\r\nbending of the hard crust above. In evidence of this, we have in the\r\nLower Permian immense volcanic ejections--lavas and other molten\r\nrocks spewed out to the surface from the softened and molten masses\r\nbelow. Fourthly, the basin of the Atlantic must have been sufficiently\r\nstrong to resist the immense lateral pressure, so that the yielding\r\nwas all concentrated on the weaker parts of the crust near the old\r\nfractures at the margins of the great continents. In these places\r\nalso, as we have seen in previous papers, the greatest thickness of\r\ndeposits had been formed; so that there was great downward pressure,\r\nand probably, also, greater softening of the lower part of the crust.\r\nFifthly, as suggested in a previous chapter, the folding of the\r\nearth's crust may have resulted from the continued shrinkage of its\r\ninterior in consequence of cooling, leading after long intervals to\r\ncollapse of the surface. Astronomers have, however, suggested another\r\ncause. The earth bulges at the equator, and is flattened at the poles\r\nin consequence of, or in connection with, the swiftness of its\r\nrotation; but it has been shown that the rotation of the earth is\r\nbeing very gradually lessened by the attraction of the moon.[T] Pierce\r\nhas recently brought forward the idea[U] that this diminution of\r\nrotation, by causing the crust to subside in the equatorial regions\r\nand expand in the polar, might produce the movements observed; and\r\nwhich, according to Lesley, have amounted in the whole course of\r\ngeological time to about two per cent, of the diameter of our globe.\r\nWe thus have two causes, either of which seems sufficient to produce\r\nthe effect.\r\n\r\n[T] Sir William Thomson, who quotes Adams and Delaunay.\r\n\r\n[U] \"Nature,\" February, 1871.\r\n\r\nViewed in this way, the great disturbances at the close of the\r\nPalæozoic period constitute one of the most instructive examples in\r\nthe whole history of the earth of that process of collapse to which\r\nthe crust was subject after long intervals, and of which no equally\r\ngreat instance occurs except at the close of the Laurentian and the\r\nclose of the Mesozoic. The mineral peculiarities of the Permian are\r\nalso accounted for by the above considerations. Let us now notice some\r\nof these. In nearly all parts of the world the Permian presents thick\r\nbeds of red sandstone and conglomerate as marked ingredients. These,\r\nas we have already seen, are indications of rapid deposition\r\naccompanying changes of level. In the Permian, as elsewhere, these\r\nbeds are accompanied by volcanic rocks, indicating the subterranean\r\ncauses of the disturbances. Again, these rocks are chiefly abundant in\r\nthose regions, like Western Europe, where the physical changes were at\r\na maximum. Another remarkable feature of the Permian rocks is the\r\noccurrence of great beds of magnesian limestone, or dolomite. In\r\nEngland, the thick yellow magnesian limestone, the outcrop of which\r\ncrosses in nearly a straight line through Durham, Yorkshire, and\r\nNottingham, marks the edge of a great Permian sea extending far to the\r\neastward. In the marls and sandstones of the Permian period there is\r\nalso much gypsum. Now, chemistry shows us that magnesian limestones\r\nand gypsums are likely to be deposited where sea water, which always\r\ncontains salts of magnesia, is evaporating in limited or circumscribed\r\nareas into which carbonate of lime and carbonate of soda are being\r\ncarried by streams from the land or springs from below;[V] and it is\r\nalso to be observed that solutions of sulphuric acid, and probably\r\nalso of sulphate of magnesia, are characteristic products of igneous\r\nactivity. Hence we find in various geological periods magnesian\r\nlimestones occurring as a deposit in limited shallow sea basins, and\r\nalso in connection with volcanic breccias. Now these were obviously\r\nthe new Permian conditions of what had once been the wide flat areas\r\nof the Carboniferous period. Still further, we find in Europe, as\r\ncharacteristic of this period, beds impregnated with metallic salts,\r\nespecially of copper. Of this kind are very markedly the copper slates\r\nof Thuringia. Such beds are not, any more then magnesian limestones,\r\nlimited to this age; but they are eminently characteristic of it. To\r\nproduce them it is required that water should bring forth from the\r\nearth's crust large quantities of metallic salts, and that these\r\nshould come into contact with vegetable matters in limited submerged\r\nareas, so that sulphates of the metals should be deoxidized into\r\nsulphides. A somewhat different chemical process, as already\r\nexplained, was very active in the coal period, and was connected with\r\nthe production of its iron ores; but, in the Permian, profound and\r\nextensive fractures opened up the way to the deep seats of copper and\r\nother metals, to enrich the copper slate and its associated beds. It\r\nis also to be observed that the alkaline springs and waters which\r\ncontain carbonate of soda, very frequently hold various metallic\r\nsalts; so that where, owing to the action of such waters, magnesian\r\nlimestone is being deposited, we may expect also to find various\r\nmetallic ores.\r\n\r\n[V] Hunt, \"Silliman's Journal,\" 1859 and 1863.\r\n\r\nLet us sum up shortly this history. We have foldings of the earth's\r\ncrust, causing volcanic action and producing limited and shallow\r\nsea-basins, and at the same time causing the evolution of alkaline and\r\nmetalliferous springs. The union of these mechanical and chemical\r\ncauses explains at once the conglomerates, the red sandstones, the\r\ntrap rocks, the magnesian limestones, the gypsum, and the\r\nmetalliferous beds of the Permian. The same considerations explain the\r\noccurrence of similar deposits in various other ages of the earth's\r\nhistory; though, perhaps, in none of these were they so general over\r\nthe Northern Hemisphere as in the Permian.\r\n\r\nFrom the size of the stones in some of the Permian conglomerates, and\r\ntheir scratched surfaces, it has been supposed that there were in this\r\nperiod, on the margins of the continents, mountains sufficiently high\r\nto have snow-clad summits, and to send down glaciers, bearing rocks\r\nand stones to the sea, on which may have floated, as now in the North\r\nAtlantic, huge icebergs.[W] This would be quite in accordance with\r\nthe great elevation of land which we know actually occurred; and the\r\nexistence of snow-clad mountains along with volcanoes would be a union\r\nof fire and frost of which we still have examples in some parts of the\r\nearth's surface, and this in proximity to forms of vegetable life very\r\nsimilar to those which we know existed in the Permian.\r\n\r\n[W] Ramsay has ably illustrated this in the Permian conglomerates of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few small and worthless beds in Russia, the\r\nPermian is not known to contain any coal. The great swamps of the coal\r\nperiod had disappeared. In part they were raised up into rugged\r\nmountains. In part they were sunken into shallow sea areas. Thus,\r\nwhile there was much dry land, there was little opportunity for coal\r\nproduction, or for the existence of those rank forests which had\r\naccumulated so much vegetable matter in the Carboniferous age. In like\r\nmanner the fauna of the Permian waters is poor. According to\r\nMurchison, the Permian limestones of Europe have afforded little more\r\nthen one-third as many species of fossils as the older Carboniferous.\r\nThe fossils themselves also have a stunted and depauperated aspect,\r\nindicating conditions of existence unfavourable to them. This is\r\ncuriously seen in contrasting Davidson's beautiful illustrations of\r\nthe British Lamp-shells of the Permian and Carboniferous periods.\r\nAnother illustrative fact is the exceptionally small size of the\r\nfossils even in limestones of the Carboniferous period when these are\r\nassociated with gypsum, red sandstones, and magnesian minerals; as,\r\nfor instance, those of some parts of Nova Scotia. In truth, the\r\npeculiar chemical conditions conducive to the production of magnesian\r\nlimestones and gypsum are not favourable to animal life, though no\r\ndoubt compatible with its existence. Hence the rich fauna of the\r\nCarboniferous seas died out in the Permian, and was not renewed; and\r\nthe Atlantic areas of the period are unknown to us. They were,\r\nhowever, probably very deep and abrupt in slope, and not rich in life.\r\nThis would be especially the case if they were desolated by cold\r\nice-laden currents.\r\n\r\nDuring the Permian period there was in each of our continental areas a\r\nsomewhat extensive inland sea. That of Western America was a northward\r\nextension of the Gulf of Mexico. That of Eastern Europe was a\r\nnorthward extension of the Euxine and Caspian. In both, the deposits\r\nformed were very similar--magnesian limestones, sandstones,\r\nconglomerates, marls, and gypsums. In both, these alternate in such a\r\nway as to show that there were frequent oscillations of level,\r\nproducing alternately shallow and deep waters. In both, the animal\r\nremains are of similar species, in many instances even identical. But\r\nin the areas intervening between these sea basins and the Atlantic the\r\nconditions were somewhat different. In Europe the land was interrupted\r\nby considerable water areas, not lakes, but inland sea basins;\r\nsometimes probably connected with the open sea, sometimes isolated. In\r\nthese were, deposited the magnesian limestone and its associated beds\r\nin England, and the Zechstein and Rotheliegende with their associates\r\nin Germany. In America the case was different. In all that immense\r\narea which extends from the Atlantic to the plains east of the\r\nMississippi, we know no Permian rocks, unless a portion of those\r\nreckoned as Upper Carboniferous, or Permo-carboniferous in Northern\r\nNova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, should be included in this\r\ngroup. If such existed, they may possibly be covered up in some places\r\nby more modern deposits, or may have been swept away by denudation in\r\nthe intervening ages; but even in these cases we should expect to find\r\nsome visible remains of them. Their entire absence would seem to\r\nindicate that a vast, and in many parts rugged and elevated, continent\r\nrepresented North America in the Permian period. Yet if so, that great\r\ncontinent is an absolute blank to us. We know nothing of the animals\r\nor plants which may have lived on it, nor do we even know with\r\ncertainty that it had active volcanoes, or snow-clad mountains sending\r\ndown glaciers.\r\n\r\nOur picture of the Permian World has not been inviting, yet in many\r\nrespects it was a world more like that in which we live then was any\r\nprevious one. It certainly presented more of variety and grand\r\nphysical features then any of the previous ages; and we might have\r\nexpected that on its wide and varied continents some new and higher\r\nforms of life would have been introduced. But it seems rather to have\r\nbeen intended to blot out the old Palæozoic life, as an arrangement\r\nwhich had been fully tried and served its end, preparatory to a new\r\nbeginning in the succeeding age.\r\n\r\nStill the Permian has some life features of its own, and we must now\r\nturn to these. The first is the occurrence here, not only of the\r\nrepresentatives of the great Batrachians of the coal period, but of\r\ntrue reptiles, acknowledged to be such by all naturalists. The animals\r\nof the genus _Protorosaurus_, found in rocks of this age both in\r\nEngland and Germany, were highly-organised lizards, having socketed\r\nteeth like those of crocodiles, and well-developed limbs, with long\r\ntails, perhaps adapted for swimming. They have, however, biconcave\r\nvertebræ like the lizard-like animals of the coal already mentioned,\r\nwhich, indeed, in their general form and appearance, they must have\r\nvery closely resembled. The Protorosaurs were not of great size; but\r\nthey must have been creatures of more stately gait then their\r\nCarboniferous predecessors, and they serve to connect them with the\r\nnew and greater reptiles of the next period.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting feature of the Permian is its flora, which, in so\r\nfar as known, is closely related to that of the coal period, though\r\nthe species are regarded as different; some of the forms, however,\r\nbeing so similar as to be possibly identical. In a picture of the\r\nPermian flora we should perhaps place in the foreground the\r\ntree-ferns, which seem to have been very abundant, and furnished with\r\ndense clusters of aërial roots to enable them to withstand the storms\r\nof this boisterous age. The tree-ferns, now so plentiful in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, should be regarded as one of the permanent\r\nvegetable institutions of our world--those of the far-back Lower\r\nDevonian, and of all intervening ages up to the present day, having\r\nbeen very much alike. The great reed-like Calamites have had a\r\ndifferent fate. In their grander forms they make their last appearance\r\nin the Permian, where they culminate in great ribbed stems, sometimes\r\nnearly a foot in diameter, and probably of immense height. The brakes\r\nof these huge mares'-tails which overspread the lower levels of the\r\nPermian in Europe, would have been to us what the hayfields of\r\nBrobdingnag were to Gulliver. The Lepidodendra also swarmed, though in\r\ndiminished force; but the great Sigillariæ of the coal are absent, or\r\nonly doubtfully present. Another feature of the Permian woods was the\r\npresence of many pine-trees different in aspect from those of the coal\r\nperiod. Some of these are remarkable for their slender and delicate\r\nbranches and foliage.[X] Others have more dense and scaly leaves, and\r\nthick short cones.[Y] Both of these styles of pines are regarded as\r\ndistinct, on the one hand, from those of the coal formation, and on\r\nthe other from those of the succeeding Trias. I have shown, however,\r\nmany years ago, that in the upper coal formation of America there are\r\nbranches of pine-trees very similar to Walchia, and, on the other\r\nhand, the Permian pines are not very remote in form and structure from\r\nsome of their modern relations. The pines of the first of the\r\nabove-mentioned types (Walchia) may indeed be regarded as allies of\r\nthe modern Araucarian pines of the southern hemisphere, and of the\r\nold conifers of the Carboniferous. Those of the second type (Ulmannia)\r\nmay be referred to the same group with the magnificent Sequoias or\r\nRedwoods of California.\r\n\r\n[X] Walchia.\r\n\r\n[Y] Ulmannia.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious indication of the doubts which sometimes rest on\r\nfossil botany, that some of the branches of these Permian pines, when\r\nimperfectly preserved, have been described as sea-weeds, while others\r\nhave been regarded as club-mosses. It is true, however, that the\r\nresemblance of some of them to the latter class of plants is very\r\ngreat; and were there no older pines, we might be pardoned for\r\nimagining in the Permian a transition from club-mosses to pines.\r\nUnfortunately, however, we have pines nearly as far back in geological\r\ntime as we have club-mosses; and, in so far as we know, no more like\r\nthe latter then are the pines of the Permian, so that this connection\r\nfails us. In all probability the Permian forests are much less\r\nperfectly known to us then those of the coal period, so that we can\r\nscarcely make comparisons. It appears certain, however, that the\r\nPermian plants are much more closely related to the coal plants then\r\nto those of the next succeeding epoch, and that they are not so much a\r\ntransition from the one to the other as the finishing of the older\r\nperiod to make way for the newer.\r\n\r\nBut we must reserve some space for a few remarks on the progress and\r\ntermination of the Palæozoic as a whole, and on the place which it\r\noccupies in the world's history. These remarks we may group around the\r\ncentral question, What is the meaning or value of an age or period in\r\nthe history of the earth, as these terms are understood by geologists?\r\nIn most geological books terms referring to time are employed very\r\nloosely. Period, epoch, age, system, series, formation, and similar\r\nterms, are used or abused in a manner which only the indefiniteness of\r\nour conceptions can excuse.\r\n\r\nA great American geologist[Z] has made an attempt to remedy this by\r\nattaching definite values to such words as those above mentioned. In\r\nhis system the greater divisions of the history were \"Times:\" thus the\r\nEozoic was a time and the Palæozoic was a time. The larger divisions\r\nof the times are \"Ages:\" thus the Lower and Upper Silurian, the\r\nDevonian, and the Carboniferous are ages, which are equivalent in the\r\nmain to what English geologists call Systems of Formations. Ages,\r\nagain, may be divided into \"Periods:\" thus, in the Upper Silurian, the\r\nLudlow of England, or Lower Helderberg of America, would constitute a\r\nperiod. These periods may again be divided into \"Epochs,\" which are\r\nequivalent to what English geologists call Formations, a term\r\nreferring not directly to the time elapsed, but to the work done in\r\nit. Now this mode of regarding geological time introduces many\r\nthoughts as to the nature of our chronology and matters relating to\r\nit. A \"time\" in geology is an extremely long time, and the Palæozoic\r\nwas perhaps the longest of the whole. By the close of the Palæozoic\r\nnine-tenths of all the rocks we know in the earth's crust were\r\nformed. At least this is the case if we reckon mere thickness. For\r\naught that we know, the Eozoic time may have accumulated as much rock\r\nas the Palæozoic; but leaving this out of the question, the rocks of\r\nthe Palæozoic are vastly thicker then those of the Mesozoic and\r\nCainozoic united. Thus the earth's history seems to have dragged\r\nslowly in its earlier stages, or to have become accelerated in its\r\nlatter times. To place it in another point of view, life changes were\r\ngreater relatively to merely physical changes in the later then in the\r\nearlier times.\r\n\r\n[Z] Dana.\r\n\r\nThe same law seems to have obtained within the Palæozoic time itself.\r\nIts older periods, as the Cambrian and Lower Silurian, present immense\r\nthicknesses of rock with little changes in life. Its later periods,\r\nthe Carboniferous and Permian, have greater life-revolution relatively\r\nto less thickness of deposits. This again was evidently related to the\r\ngrowing complexity and variety of geographical conditions, which went\r\non increasing all the way up to the Permian, when they attained their\r\nmaximum for the Palæozoic time.\r\n\r\nAgain, each age was signalized, over the two great continental\r\nplateaus, by a like series of elevations and depressions. We may\r\nregard the Siluro-Cambrian, the Silurian, the Devonian, the\r\nCarboniferous, and Permian, as each of them a distinct age. Each of\r\nthese began with physical disturbances and coarse shallow-water\r\ndeposits. In each this was succeeded by subsidence and by a sea area\r\ntenanted by corals and shell-fishes. In each case this was followed by\r\na re-elevation, leading to a second but slow and partial subsidence,\r\nto be followed by the great re-elevation preparatory to the next\r\nperiod. Thus we have throughout the Palæozoic a series of cycles of\r\nphysical change which we may liken to gigantic pulsations of the thick\r\nhide of mother earth. The final catastrophe of the Permian collapse\r\nwas quite different in kind from these pulsations as well as much\r\ngreater in degree. The Cambrian or Primordial does not apparently\r\npresent a perfect cycle of this kind, perhaps because in that early\r\nperiod the continental plateaus were not yet definitely formed, and\r\nthus its beds are rather portions of the general oceanic deposit. In\r\nthis respect it is analogous in geological relations to the chalk\r\nformation of a later age, though very different in material. The\r\nCambrian may, however, yet vindicate its claim to be regarded as a\r\ndefinite cycle: and the recent discoveries of Hicks in North Wales,\r\nhave proved the existence of a rich marine fauna far down in the lower\r\npart of this system. It is also to be observed that the peculiar\r\ncharacter of the Cambrian, as an oceanic bottom rather then a\r\ncontinental plateau, has formed an important element in the\r\ndifficulties in establishing it as a distinct group; just as a similar\r\ndifficulty in the case of the chalk has led to a recent controversy\r\nabout the continuance of the conditions of that period into modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nBut in each of the great successive heaves or pulsations of the\r\nPalæozoic earth, there was a growing balance in favour of the land as\r\ncompared with the water. In each successive movement more and more\r\nelevated land was thrown up, until the Permian flexures finally fixed\r\nthe forms of our continents. This may be made evident to the eye in a\r\nseries of curves, as in the following diagram, in which I have\r\nendeavoured to show the recurrence of similar conditions in each of\r\nthe great periods of the Palæozoic, and thus their equivalency to each\r\nother as cycles of the earth's history.\r\n\r\nThere is thus in these great continental changes a law of recurrence\r\nand a law of progress; but as to the efficient causes of the phenomena\r\nwe have as yet little information. It seems that original fractures\r\nand shrinkages of the crust were concerned in forming the continental\r\nareas at first. Once formed, unequal burdening of the earth's still\r\nplastic mass by deposits of sediment in the waters, and unequal\r\nexpansion by the heating and crystallization of immense thicknesses of\r\nthe sediment, may have done the rest; but the results are surprisingly\r\nregular to be produced by such causes. We shall also find that similar\r\ncycles can be observed in the geological ages which succeeded the\r\nPalæozoic. Geologists have hitherto for the most part been content to\r\nassign these movements to causes purely terrestrial; but it is\r\ndifficult to avoid the suspicion that the succession of geological\r\ncycles must have depended on some recurring astronomical force tending\r\nto cause the weaker parts of the earth's crust alternately to rise and\r\nsubside at regular intervals of time. Herschel, Adhémar, and more\r\nrecently Croll, have directed attention to astronomical cycles\r\nsupposed to have important influences on the temperature of the earth.\r\nWhether these or other changes may have acted on the equilibrium of\r\nits crust is a question well worthy of attention, as its solution\r\nmight give us an astronomical measure of geological time. This\r\nquestion, however, the geologist must refer to the astronomer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURVES SHOWING THE SUCCESSIVE ELEVATIONS AND\r\nDEPRESSIONS OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT, IN SEVERAL CYCLES OF THE\r\nPALÆOZOIC TIME.]\r\n\r\nThere are two notes of caution which must here be given to the reader.\r\nFirst, it is not intended to apply the doctrine of continental\r\noscillations to the great oceanic areas. Whether they became shallower\r\nor deeper, their conditions would be different from those which\r\noccurred in the great shallow plateaus, and these conditions are\r\nlittle known to us. Further, throughout the Palæozoic period, the\r\noscillations do not seem to have been sufficient to reverse the\r\npositions of the oceans and continents. Secondly, it is not meant to\r\naffirm that the great Permian plications were so widespread in their\r\neffects as to produce a universal destruction of life. On the\r\ncontrary, after they had occurred, remnants of the Carboniferous fauna\r\nstill flourished even on the surfaces of the continents, and possibly\r\nthe inhabitants of the deep ocean were little affected by these great\r\nmovements. True it is that the life of the Palæozoic terminates with\r\nthe Permian, but not by a great and cataclysmic overthrow.\r\n\r\nWe know something at least of the general laws of continental\r\noscillations during the Palæozoic. Do we know anything of law in the\r\ncase of life? The question raises so many and diverse considerations\r\nthat it seems vain to treat it in the end of a chapter; still we must\r\ntry to outline it with at least a few touches.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, the life of the Palæozoic was remarkable, as compared with\r\nthat of the present world, in presenting a great prevalence of animals\r\nand plants of synthetic types, as they are called by Agassiz that is,\r\nof creatures comprehending in one the properties of several groups\r\nwhich were to exist as distinct in the future. Such types are also\r\nsometimes called embryonic, because the young of animals and plants\r\noften show these comprehensive features. Such types were the old\r\ncorals, presenting points of alliance with two distinct groups now\r\nwidely separated; the old Trilobites, half king-crabs and half\r\nIsopods; the Amphibians of the coal, part fish, part newt, and part\r\ncrocodile; the Sigillariæ, part club-mosses and part pines; the\r\nOrthoceratites, half nautili and half cuttle-fishes. I proposed, in\r\nthe illustration in a former article, to give a restoration of one of\r\nthe curious creatures last mentioned, the Orthoceratites; but on\r\nattempting this, with the idea that, as usually supposed, they were\r\nstraight Nautili, it appeared that the narrow aperture, the small\r\nouter chamber, the thin outer wall, often apparently only membranous,\r\nand the large siphuncle, would scarcely admit of this; and I finished\r\nby representing it as something like a modern squid; perhaps wrongly,\r\nbut it was evidently somewhere between them and the Nautili.\r\n\r\nSecondly, these synthetic types often belonged to the upper part of a\r\nlower group, or to the lower part of an upper group. Hence in one\r\npoint of view they may be regarded as of high grade, in another as of\r\nlow grade, and they are often large in size or in vegetative\r\ndevelopment.[AA] From this law have arisen many controversies about\r\nthe grade and classification of the Palæozoic animals and plants.\r\n\r\n[AA] It seems, indeed, as if the new synthetic forms intermediate\r\nbetween great groups were often large in size, while the new special\r\ntypes came in as small species. There are some remarkable cases of\r\nthis in the plant world; though here we have such examples as the\r\npines and tree-ferns continuing almost unchanged from an early\r\nPalæozoic period until now.\r\n\r\nThirdly, extinctions of species occur in every great oscillation of\r\nthe continental areas, but some species reappear after such\r\noscillations, and the same genus often recurs under new specific\r\nforms. Families and orders, such as those of the Trilobites and\r\nOrthoceratites, appear to have a grand and gradual culmination and\r\ndecadence extending over several successive periods, or even over the\r\nwhole stretch of the Palæozoic time. Toward the close of the\r\nPalæozoic, while all the species disappear, some whole families and\r\norders are altogether dropped, and, being chiefly synthetic groups,\r\nare replaced by more specialised types, some of which, however, make\r\nsmall beginnings alongside of the more general types which are passing\r\naway. Our diagram (page 183) illustrates these points.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM SHOWING THE ADVANCE, CULMINATION, AND DECADENCE\r\nOF SOME OF THE LEADING TYPES OF PALÆOZOIC LIFE.]\r\n\r\nFourthly, the progress in animal life in the Palæozoic related chiefly\r\nto the lower or invertebrate tribes, and to the two lower classes of\r\nthe vertebrates. The oldest animal known to us is not only a creature\r\nof the simplest structure, but also a representative of that great and\r\non the whole low type of animal life, in which the parts are arranged\r\naround a central axis, and not on that plan of bilateral symmetry\r\nwhich constitutes one great leading distinction of the higher animals.\r\nWith the Cambrian, bilateral animals abound and belong to two very\r\ndistinct lines of progress--the one, the Mollusks, showing the\r\nnutritive organs more fully developed--the other, the Articulates,\r\nhaving the organs of sense and of locomotion more fully organized.\r\nThese three great types shared the world among them throughout the\r\nearlier Palæozoic time, and only in its later ages began to be\r\ndominated by the higher types of fishes and reptiles. In so far as we\r\nknow, it remained for the Mesozoic to introduce the birds and mammals.\r\nIn plant life the changes were less marked, though here also there is\r\nprogress--land plants appear to begin, not with the lowest forms, but\r\nwith the highest types of the lower of the two great series into which\r\nthe vegetable kingdom is divided. From this they rapidly rise to a\r\nfull development of the lowest type of the flowering plants, the pines\r\nand their allies, and there the progress ceases; for the known\r\nrepresentatives of the higher plants are extremely few and apparently\r\nof little importance.\r\n\r\nFifthly, in general the history tells of a continued series of\r\nalternate victories and defeats of the species that had their birth on\r\nthe land and in the shallow waters, and those which were born in the\r\nocean depths, The former spread themselves widely after every\r\nupheaval, and then by every subsidence were driven back to their\r\nmountain fastnesses. The latter perished from the continental plateaus\r\nat every upheaval, but climbed again in new hordes and reoccupied the\r\nground after every subsidence. But just as in human history every\r\nvictory or defeat urges on the progress of events, and develops the\r\ngreat plan of God's providence in the elevation of man; so here every\r\nsucceeding change brings in new and higher actors on the stage, and\r\nthe scheme of creation moves on in a grand and steady progress towards\r\nthe more varied and elevated life of the Modern World.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, how little do we know of these laws, which are only\r\nbeginning to dawn on the minds of naturalists; and which the\r\nimperfections of our classification and nomenclature, and the defects\r\nin our knowledge of fossil species, render very dim and uncertain. All\r\nthat appears settled is the existence of a definite plan, working over\r\nlong ages, and connected with the most remarkable correlation of\r\nphysical and organic change: going on with regular march throughout\r\nthe Palæozoic, and then brought to a close to make room for another\r\ngreat succession. This following Mesozoic time must next engage our\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nWe may close for the present with presenting to the eye in tabular\r\nform the periods over which we have passed. The table on page 187, and\r\nthe diagram (page 179), mutually illustrate each other; and it will\r\nbe seen that each age constitutes cycle, similar in its leading\r\nfeatures to the other cycles, while each is distinguished by some\r\nimportant fact in relation to the introduction of living beings. In\r\nthis table I have, with Mr. Hull,[AB] for simplicity, arranged the\r\nformations of each age under three periods--an older, middle, and\r\nnewer. Of these, however, the last or newest is in each case so\r\nimportant and varied as to merit division into two, in the manner\r\nwhich I have suggested in previous publications for the Palæozoic\r\nrocks of North America.[AC] Under each period I have endeavoured to\r\ngive some characteristic example from Europe and America, except\r\nwhere, as in the case of the coal formation, the same names are used\r\non both continents. Such a table as this, it must be observed, is only\r\ntentative, and may admit of important modifications. The Laurentian\r\nmore especially may admit of division into several ages; and a\r\nseparate age may be found to intervene between it and the Cambrian.\r\nThe reader will please observe that this table refers to the changes\r\non the continental plateaus; and that on both of these each age was\r\nintroduced with shallow water and usually coarse deposits, succeeded\r\nby deeper water and finer beds, usually limestones, and these by a\r\nmixed formation returning to the shallow water and coarse deposits of\r\nthe older period of the age. This last kind of deposition culminates\r\nin the great swamps of the coal formation.\r\n\r\n[AB] \"Quarterly Journal of Science,\" July, 1869.\r\n\r\n[AC] \"Acadian Geology,\" p. 137.\r\n\r\nCONDENSED TABULAR VIEW OF THE AGES AND PERIODS OF THE PALÆOZOIC AND\r\nEOZOIC.\r\n\r\n  Key to Symbols\r\n\r\n  ### Tabulate and Rugose Corals, abundant.\r\n  *** Age of Algæ.\r\n  === Age of Acrogens and Gymnosperms.\r\n  +++ And God said, \"Let the waters bring forth abundantly\r\n        the swarming living creatures.\"\r\n  --- And God created great reptiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TIMES.\r\n      AGES.

In\r\nthe domain of life a great gulf lies between; and the geologist whose\r\nmind is filled with the forms of the Palæozoic period, on rising into\r\nthe next succeeding beds, feels himself a sort of Rip Van Winkle, who\r\nhas slept a hundred years and awakes in a new world. The geography of\r\nour continents seems indeed to have changed little from the time of\r\nthe Permian to that next succeeding group which all geologists\r\nrecognise as the beginning of the Mesozoic or Middle Age of the\r\nworld's history, the Triassic period. Where best developed, as in\r\nGermany, it gives us the usual threefold series, conglomerates and\r\nsandstones below, a shelly limestone in the middle, and sandstones and\r\nmarls above. Curiously enough, the Germans, recognising this\r\ntripartite character here more distinctly then in their other\r\nformations, named this the _Trias_ or triple group, a name which it\r\nstill retains, though as we have seen it is by no means the earliest\r\nof the triple groups of strata. In England, where the middle limestone\r\nis absent, it is a \"New Red Sandstone,\" and the same name may be\r\nappropriately extended to Eastern America, where bright red sandstones\r\nare a characteristic feature. In the Trias, as in the Permian, the\r\ncontinents of the northern hemisphere presented large land areas, and\r\nthere were lagoons and landlocked seas in which gypsum, magnesian\r\nlimestones, and rock salt were thrown down, a very eminent example of\r\nwhich is afforded by the great salt deposits of Cheshire. There were\r\nalso tremendous outbursts of igneous activity along the margins of the\r\ncontinents, more especially in Eastern America. But with all this\r\nthere was a rich land flora and a wonderful exuberance of new animal\r\nlife on the land; and in places there were even swamps in which pure\r\nand valuable beds of coal, comparable with those of the old coal\r\nformation, were deposited.\r\n\r\nThe triple division of the Trias as a cycle of the earth's history,\r\nand its local imperfection, are well seen in the European development\r\nof the group, thus:--\r\n\r\n    German Series.          French Series.       English Series.\r\n\r\n  Keuper, Sandstone and } Marnes Irisées      {Saliferous and gypseous\r\n   Shale                }                     { Shales and Sandstones.\r\n\r\n  Muschelkalk, Limestone} Calcaire Coquillier {Wanting.\r\n   and Dolomite         }\r\n\r\n  Bunter, Sandstone and } Grès bigarré        {Sandstone and\r\n   Conglomerate         }                     { Conglomerate.\r\n\r\nThe Trias is succeeded by a great and complex system of formations,\r\nusually known as the Jurassic, from its admirable development and\r\nexposure in the range of the Jura; but which the English geologists\r\noften name the \"Oolitic,\" from the occurrence in it of beds of Oolite\r\nor roe-stone. This rock, of which the beautiful cream-coloured\r\nlimestone of Bath is an illustration, consists of an infinity of\r\nlittle spheres, like seeds or the roe of a fish. Under the microscope\r\nthese are seen to present concentric layers, each with a radiating\r\nfibrous: structure, and often to have a minute grain of sand or\r\nfragment of shell in the centre. They are, in short, miniature\r\nconcretions, produced by the aggregation of the calcareous matter\r\naround centres, by a process of molecular attraction to which fine\r\nsediments, and especially those containing much lime, are very prone.\r\nThis style of limestone is very abundant in the Jurassic system, but\r\nit is not confined to it. I have seen very perfect Oolites in the\r\nSilurian and the Carboniferous. The Jurassic series, as developed in\r\nEngland, may be divided into three triplets or cycles of beds, in the\r\nfollowing way:\r\n\r\n                     {Purbeck Beds.\r\n  Upper Jurassic     {Portland Limestone.\r\n                     {Portland Sand.\r\n\r\n                     {Kimmeridge Clay, etc.\r\n  Middle Jurassic    {Coral Rag, Limestone.\r\n                     {Lower Calcareous Grit, Oxford Clay, etc.\r\n\r\n                     {Cornbrash and Forest Marble.\r\n  Lower Jurassic[AD] {Great and inferior Oolite, Limestone.\r\n                     {Lias Clays and Limestones.\r\n\r\n[AD] This last group is very complex, and might perhaps admit of sub\r\ndivision, locally at least, into subordinate cycles.\r\n\r\nThese rocks occupy a large space in England, as the names above given\r\nwill serve to show; and they are also largely distributed over the\r\ncontinent of Europe and Asia which had evidently three great and\r\nlong-continued dips under water, indicated by the three great\r\nlimestones. In America the case was different. The Jurassic has not\r\nbeen distinctly recognised in any part of the eastern coast of that\r\ncontinent, which then perhaps extended farther into the Atlantic then\r\nit does at present; so that no marine beds were formed on its eastern\r\nborder. But in the west, along the base of the Rocky Mountains and\r\nalso in the Arctic area, there were Jurassic seas of large extent,\r\nswarming with characteristic animals. At the close of the Jurassic\r\nperiod our continents seem to have been even more extensive then at\r\npresent. In England and the neighbouring parts of the continent of\r\nEurope, according to Lyell, the fresh-water and estuarine beds known\r\nas the Wealden have been traced 320 miles from west to east, and 200\r\nmiles from north-west to south-east, and their thickness in one part\r\nof this area is estimated at no less then 2,000 feet. Such a deposit\r\nis comparable in extent with the deltas of such great rivers as the\r\nNiger or even the Mississippi, and implies the existence of a\r\ncontinent much more extensive and more uniform in drainage then Europe\r\nas it at present exists. Lyell even speculates on the possible\r\nexistence of an Atlantic continent west of Europe. America also at\r\nthis time had, as already stated, attained to even more then its\r\npresent extension eastwards. Thus this later Jurassic period was the\r\nculmination of the Mesozoic, the period of its most perfect\r\ncontinental development, corresponding in this to the Carboniferous in\r\nthe Palæozoic.\r\n\r\nThe next or closing period of this great Mesozoic time brought a\r\nwondrous change. In the Cretaceous period, so called from the vast\r\ndeposits of chalk by which it is characterized, the continents sunk as\r\nthey had never sunk before, so that vast spaces of the great\r\ncontinental plateaus were brought down, for the first time since the\r\nLaurentian, to the condition of abyssal depths, tenanted by such\r\ncreatures as live in the deepest recesses of our modern oceans. This\r\ngreat depression affected Europe more severely then America; the\r\ndepression of the latter being not only less, but somewhat later in\r\ndate. In Europe, at the period of greatest submergence, the hills of\r\nScandinavia and of Britain, and the Urals, perhaps alone stood out of\r\nthe sea. The Alps and their related mountains, and even the Himalayas,\r\nwere not yet born, for they have on their high summits deep-sea beds\r\nof the Cretaceous and even of later date. In America, the Appalachians\r\nand the old Laurentian ranges remained above water; but the Rocky\r\nMountains and the Andes were in great part submerged, and a great\r\nCretaceous sea extended from the Appalachians westward to the Pacific,\r\nand southward to the Gulf of Mexico, opening probably to the North\r\ninto the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nThis great depression must have been of very long continuance, since\r\nin Western Europe it sufficed for the production of nearly 1,000 feet\r\nin thickness of chalk, a rock which, being composed almost entirely of\r\nmicroscopic shells, is, as we shall see in the sequel, necessarily of\r\nextremely slow growth. If we regard the Cretaceous group as one of our\r\ngreat ages or cycles, it seems to be incomplete. The sandstones and\r\nclays known as the Greensand and Gault constitute its lower or\r\nshallow-water member. The chalk is its middle or deep-sea member, but\r\nthe upper shallow-water member is missing, or only very locally and\r\nimperfectly developed. And the oldest of the succeeding Tertiary\r\ndeposits, which indicate much less continuous marine conditions, rest\r\non the chalk, as if the great and deep sea of the Cretaceous age had\r\nbeen suddenly upheaved into land. This abrupt termination of the last\r\ncycle of the Mesozoic is obviously the reason of the otherwise\r\ninexplicable fact that the prevalent life of the period ceases at the\r\ntop of the chalk, and is exchanged immediately and without any\r\ntransition for the very different fauna of the Tertiary. This further\r\naccords with the fact that the Cretaceous subsidence ended in another\r\ngreat crumpling of the crust, like that which distinguished the\r\nPermian. By this the Mesozoic time was terminated and the Cainozoic\r\ninaugurated; while the Rocky Mountains, the Andes, the Alps, and the\r\nHimalayas, rose to importance as great mountain ranges, and the\r\ncontinents were again braced up to retain a condition of comparative\r\nequilibrium during that later period of the earth's chronology to\r\nwhich we ourselves belong.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIFE ON LAND IN THE MESOZOIC PERIOD.\r\n\r\nIn the foreground are a Pine, Cycads, and a Pandanus; also small\r\nMammals, an herbivorous Dinosaur, and a Labyrinthodont. In the\r\ndistance are other Dinosaurs and Crocodiles. In the air are birds\r\n(_Archæopterux_) and Pterodactyls.\r\n\r\nWas the length of the Mesozoic time equal to that of the Palæozoic?\r\nMeasured by recurring cycles it was. In the latter period we find five\r\ngreat cycles, from the Lower Silurian to the Permian inclusive. So in\r\nthe Mesozoic we have five also, from the Trias to the Cretaceous\r\ninclusive. We have a right to reckon these cycles as ages or great\r\nyears of the earth; and so reckoning them, the Mesozoic time may have\r\nbeen as long as the Palæozoic. But if we take another criterion the\r\nresult will be different. The thickness of the deposits in the\r\nPalæozoic as compared with the Mesozoic, where these are severally\r\nbest developed, may be estimated as at least four or five to one; so\r\nthat if we suppose the beds to have been formed with equal rapidity in\r\nthe two great periods, then the older of the two was between four and\r\nfive times as long as the latter, which would indeed be only a little\r\ngreater then one of the separate ages of the Palæozoic. Either,\r\ntherefore, the deposits took place with greater rapidity in the\r\nPalæozoic, or that period was by much the longer of the two. This it\r\nwill be observed, is only another aspect of the great laws of\r\ngeological sequence referred to in our last paper.\r\n\r\nLet us look into this question a little more minutely. If the several\r\npulsations of our continents depended upon any regularly recurring\r\nastronomical or terrestrial change, then they must represent, at least\r\napproximately, equal portions of time, and this, if proved, would\r\nsettle the question in favour of an equal duration of these two great\r\neras of the earth's history. But as we cannot yet prove this, we may\r\nconsider what light we can derive from the nature of the rocks\r\nproduced. These may be roughly classified as of two kinds: First, the\r\nbeds of sediment, sand, clay, etc., accumulated by the slow chemical\r\ndecay of rocks and the mechanical agency of water. Secondly, the beds\r\nformed by accumulation of the harder and less perishable parts of\r\nliving beings, of which the limestones are the chief. With reference\r\nto the first of these kinds of deposit, the action of the atmosphere\r\nand rains on rocks in the earlier times might have been somewhat more\r\npowerful if there was more carbonic acid in the atmosphere, that\r\nsubstance being the most efficient agent in the chemical decay of\r\nrocks. It might have been somewhat more powerful if there was a\r\ngreater rainfall. It must, on the other hand, have been lessened by\r\nthe apparently more equable temperature which then prevailed. These\r\ndifferences might perhaps nearly balance one another. Then the rocks\r\nof the older time were quite as intractable as those of the newer, and\r\nthey were probably neither so high nor so extensive. Further, the dips\r\nand emergences of the great continental plateaus were equally numerous\r\nin the two great periods, though they were probably, with the\r\nexception of the latest one of each, more complete in the older\r\nperiod. In so far, then, as deposition of sediment is concerned, these\r\nconsiderations would scarcely lead us to infer that it was more rapid\r\nin the Palæozoic. But the Palæozoic sediments may be estimated in the\r\naggregate at about 50,000 feet in thickness, while those of the\r\nMesozoic scarcely reach 8,000. We might, therefore, infer that the\r\nPalæozoic period was perhaps five or six times as long as the\r\nMesozoic.\r\n\r\nIf we take the second class of rocks, the limestones, and suppose\r\nthese to have been accumulated by the slow growth of corals, shells,\r\netc., in the sea, we might, at first sight, suppose that Palæozoic\r\nanimals would not grow or accumulate limestone faster then their\r\nMesozoic successors. We must, however, consider here the probability\r\nthat the older oceans contained more lime in solution then those which\r\nnow exist, and that the equable temperature and extensive submerged\r\nplateaus gave very favourable conditions for the lower animals of the\r\nsea, so that it would perhaps be fair to allow a somewhat more rapid\r\nrate of growth of limestone for the Palæozoic. Now the actual\r\nproportions of limestone may be roughly stated at 13,000 feet in the\r\nPalæozoic, and 3,000 feet in the Mesozoic, which would give a\r\nproportion of about four and a quarter to one; and as a foot of\r\nlimestone may be supposed on the average to require five times as long\r\nfor its formation as a foot of sediment, this would give an even\r\ngreater absolute excess in favour of the Palæozoic on the evidence of\r\nthe limestones an excess probably far too great to be accounted for by\r\nany more favourable conditions for the secretion of carbonate of lime\r\nby marine animals.\r\n\r\nThe data for such calculations are very uncertain, and three elements\r\nof additional uncertainty closely related to each other must also be\r\nnoticed. The first is the unknown length of the intervals in which no\r\ndeposition whatever may have been taking place over the areas open to\r\nour investigation. The second is the varying amounts in which material\r\nonce deposited may have been swept away by water. The third is the\r\namount of difference that may have resulted from the progressive\r\nchange of the geographical features of our continents. These\r\nuncertainties would all tend to diminish our estimate of the relative\r\nlength of the Mesozoic. Lastly, the changes that have taken place in\r\nliving beings, though a good measure of the lapse of time, cannot be\r\ntaken as a criterion here, since there is much reason to believe that\r\nmore rapid changes of physical conditions act as an inducing cause of\r\nrapid changes of life.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, taking such facts as we have, and making large\r\ndeductions for the several causes tending to exaggerate our conception\r\nof Palæozoic time, we can scarcely doubt that the Palæozoic may have\r\nbeen three times as long as the Mesozoic. If so, the continental\r\npulsations, and the changes in animal and vegetable life, must have\r\ngone on with accelerated rapidity in the later period,--a conclusion\r\nto which we shall again have occasion to refer when we arrive at the\r\nconsideration of the Tertiary or Neozoic time, and the age of man, and\r\nthe probable duration of the order of things under which we live.\r\n\r\nI have given this preliminary sketch of the whole Mesozoic time,\r\nbecause we cannot here, as in the Palæozoic, take up each age\r\nseparately; and now we must try to picture to ourselves the life and\r\naction of these ages. In doing so we may look at, first, the plant\r\nlife of this period; second, animal life on the land; and third,\r\nanimal life in the waters and in the ocean depths.\r\n\r\nThe Mesozoic shores were clothed with an abundant flora, which changed\r\nconsiderably in its form during the lapse of this long time; but yet\r\nit has a character of its own distinct from that of the previous\r\nPalæozoic and the succeeding Tertiary. Perhaps no feature of this\r\nperiod is more characteristic then the great abundance of those\r\nsingular plants, the cycads, which in the modern flora are placed near\r\nto the pines, but in their appearance and habit more resemble palms,\r\nand which in the modern world are chiefly found in the tropical and\r\nwarm temperate zones of Asia and America. No plants certainly of this\r\norder occur in the Carboniferous, where their nearest allies are\r\nperhaps some of the Sigillariæ; and in the modern time the cycads are\r\nnot so abundant, nor do they occur at all in climates where their\r\npredecessors appear to have abounded. In the quarries of the island of\r\nPortland, we have a remarkable evidence of this in beds with numerous\r\nstems of cycads still _in situ_ in the soil in which they grew, and\r\nassociated with stumps of pines which seem to have flourished along\r\nwith them. In further illustration of this point, I may refer to the\r\nfact that Carruthers, in a recent paper, catalogues twenty-five\r\nBritish species belonging to eight genera--a fact which markedly\r\ncharacterizes the British flora of the Mesozoic period. These plants\r\nwill therefore occupy a prominent place in our restoration of the\r\nMesozoic landscape, and we should give especial prominence to the\r\nbeautiful species _Williamsonia gigas_, discovered by the eminent\r\nbotanist whose name it bears, and restored in his paper on the plant\r\nin the \"Linnæan Transactions.\" These plants, with pines and gigantic\r\nequisetums, prevailed greatly in the earlier Mesozoic flora, but as\r\nthe time wore on, various kinds of endogens, resembling the palms and\r\nthe screw-pines of the tropical islands, were introduced, and toward\r\nits close some representatives of the exogens very like our ordinary\r\ntrees. Among these we find for the first time in our upward progress\r\nin the history of the earth, species of our familiar oaks, figs, and\r\nwalnut, along with some trees now confined to Australia and the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, as the banksias and \"silver-trees,\" and their allies. In\r\nAmerica a large number of the genera of the modern trees are present,\r\nand even some of those now peculiar to America, as the tulip-trees and\r\nsweet-gums. These forests of the later Mesozoic must therefore have\r\nbeen as gay with flowers and as beautiful in foliage as those of the\r\nmodern world, and there is evidence that they swarmed with insect\r\nlife. Further, the Mesozoic plants produced in some places beds of\r\ncoal comparable in value and thickness to those of the old coal\r\nformation. Of this kind are the coal beds of Brora in Sutherlandshire,\r\nthose of Richmond in Virginia, and Deep River in N. Carolina, those of\r\nVancouver's Island, and a large part of those of China. To the same\r\nage have been referred some at least of the coal beds of Australia and\r\nIndia. So important are these beds in China, that had geology\r\noriginated in that country, the Mesozoic might have been our age of\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\nIf the forests of the Mesozoic present a great advance over those of\r\nthe Palæozoic, so do the animals of the land, which now embrace all\r\nthe great types of vertebrate life. Some of these creatures have left\r\nstrange evidence of their existence in their footprints on the sand\r\nand clay, now cemented into beds of hard rock excavated by the\r\nquarryman. If we had landed on some wide muddy Mesozoic shore, we\r\nmight have found it marked in all directions with animal footprints.\r\nSome of these are shaped much like a human hand. The creature that\r\nmade this mark was a gigantic successor of the crocodilian newts or\r\nlabyrinthodonts of the Carboniferous, and this type seems to have\r\nattained its maximum in this period, where one species, _Labyrinthodon\r\ngiganteus_, had great teeth three or four inches in length, and\r\npresenting in their cross section the most complicated foldings of\r\nenamel imaginable. But we may see on the shores still more remarkable\r\nfootprints. They indicate biped and three-toed animals of gigantic\r\nsize, with a stride perhaps six feet in length. Were they enormous\r\nbirds? If so, the birds of this age must have been giants which would\r\ndwarf even our ostriches. But as we walk along the shore we see many\r\nother impressions, some of them much smaller and different in form.\r\nSome, again, very similar in other respects, have four toes; and, more\r\nwonderful still, in tracing up some of the tracks, we find that here\r\nand there the creature has put down on the ground a sort of\r\nfour-fingered hand, while some of these animals seem to have trailed\r\nlong tails behind them. What were these portentous creatures--bird,\r\nbeast, or reptile? The answer has been given to us by their bones, as\r\nstudied by Yon Meyer and Owen, and more recently by Huxley and Cope.\r\nWe thus have brought before us the _Dinosaurs_--the terrible\r\nSaurians--of the Mesozoic age, the noblest of the Tanninim of old.\r\nThese creatures constitute numerous genera and species, some of\r\ngigantic size, others comparatively small;--some harmless browsers on\r\nplants, others terrible renders of living flesh; but all remarkable\r\nfor presenting a higher type of reptile organization then any now\r\nexisting, and approaching in some respects to the birds and in others\r\nto the mammalia. Let us take one example of each of the principal\r\ngroups. And first marches before us the _Iguanodon_ or his relation\r\n_Hadrosaurus_--a gigantic biped, twenty feet or more in height, with\r\nenormous legs shaped like those of an ostrich, but of elephantine\r\nthickness. It strides along, not by leaps like a kangaroo, but with\r\nslow and stately tread, occasionally resting, and supporting itself on\r\nthe tripod formed by its hind limbs and a huge tail, like the inverted\r\ntrunk of a tree. The upper part of its body becomes small and slender,\r\nand its head, of diminutive size and mild aspect, is furnished with\r\nteeth for munching the leaves and fruits of trees, which it can easily\r\nreach with its small fore-limbs, or hands, as it walks through the\r\nwoods. The outward appearance of these creatures we do not certainly\r\nknow. It is not likely that they had bony plates like crocodiles, but\r\nthey may have shone resplendent in horny scale armour of varied hues.\r\nBut another and more dreadful form rises before us. It is\r\n_Megalosaurus_ or perhaps _Lælaps_. Here we have a creature of equally\r\ngigantic size and biped habits; but it is much more agile, and runs\r\nwith great swiftness or advances by huge leaps, and its feet and hands\r\nare armed with strong curved claws; while its mouth has a formidable\r\narmature of sharp-edged and pointed teeth. It is a type of a group of\r\nbiped bird-like lizards, the most terrible and formidable of rapacious\r\nanimals that the earth has ever seen. Some of these creatures, in\r\ntheir short deep jaws and heads, resembled the great carnivorous\r\nmammals of modern times, while all in the structure of their limbs had\r\na strange and grotesque resemblance to the birds. Nearly all\r\nnaturalists regard them as reptiles; but in their circulation and\r\nrespiration they must have approached to the mammalia, and their\r\ngeneral habit of body recalls that of the kangaroos. They were no\r\ndoubt oviparous; and this, with their biped habit, seems to explain\r\nthe strong resemblance of their hind quarters to those of birds. Had\r\nwe seen the eagle-clawed Lælaps rushing on his prey; throwing his huge\r\nbulk perhaps thirty feet through the air, and crushing to the earth\r\nunder his gigantic talons some feebler Hadrosaur, we should have\r\nshudderingly preferred the companionship of modern wolves and tigers\r\nto that of those savage and gigantic monsters of the Mesozoic.\r\n\r\nWe must not leave the great land-lizards of the reptilian age, without\r\nsome notice of that Goliath of the race which, by a singular misnomer,\r\nhas received the appellation of _Ceteosaurus_ or \"Whale-Saurian.\" It\r\nwas first introduced to naturalists by the discovery of a few enormous\r\nvertebrae in the English Oolite; and as these in size and form seemed\r\nbest to fit an aquatic creature, it was named in accordance with this\r\nview. But subsequent discoveries have shown that, incredible though\r\nthis at first appeared, the animal had limbs fitted for walking on the\r\nland. Professor Phillips has been most successful in collecting and\r\nrestoring the remains of Ceteosaurus, and devotes to its history a\r\nlong and interesting section of his \"Geology of Oxford.\" The size of\r\nthe animal may be estimated, from the fact that its thigh-bone is\r\nsixty-four inches long, and thick in proportion. From this and other\r\nfragments of the skeleton, we learn that this huge monster must have\r\nstood ten feet high when on all fours, and that its length, could not\r\nhave been less then fifty feet; perhaps much more. From a single\r\ntooth, which has been found, it seems to have been herbivorous; and it\r\nwas probably a sort of reptilian Hippopotamus, living on the rich\r\nherbage by the sides of streams and marshes, and perhaps sometimes\r\ntaking to the water, where the strokes of its powerful tail would\r\nenable it to move more rapidly then on the land. In structure, it\r\nseems to have been a composite creature, resembling in many points the\r\ncontemporary Dinosaurs; but in others, approaching to the crocodiles\r\nand the lizards.\r\n\r\nBut the wonders of Mesozoic reptiles are not yet exhausted. While\r\nnoticing numerous crocodiles and lizard: like creatures, and several\r\nkinds of tortoises, we are startled by what seems a flight of great\r\nbats, wheeling and screaming overhead, pouncing on smaller creatures\r\nof their own kind, as hawks seize sparrows and partridges, and perhaps\r\ndiving into the sea for fish. These were the Pterodactyles, the\r\nreptile bats of the Mesozoic. They fly by means of a membrane\r\nstretched on a monstrously enlarged little finger, while the other\r\nfingers of the fore limb are left free to be used as hands or feet. To\r\nmove these wings, they had large breast-muscles like those of birds.\r\nIn their general structure, they were lizards, but no doubt of far\r\nhigher organization then any animals of this order now living; and in\r\naccordance with this, the interior of their skull shows that they must\r\nhave had a brain comparable with that of birds, which, they rivalled\r\nin energy and intelligence. Some of them were larger then the largest\r\nmodern birds of prey, others were like pigeons and snipes in size.\r\nSpecimens in the Cambridge Museum indicate one species twenty feet in\r\nthe expanse of its wings. Cope has recently described an equally\r\ngigantic species from the Mesozoic of Western America, and fragments\r\nof much larger species are said to exist.[AE] Imagine such a creature,\r\na flying dragon, with vast skinny wings, its body, perhaps, covered\r\nwith scales, both wings and feet armed with strong claws, and with\r\nlong jaws furnished with sharp teeth. Nothing can be conceived more\r\nstrange and frightful. Some of them had the hind limbs long, like\r\nwading birds. Some had short, legs, adapted perhaps for perching. They\r\ncould probably fold up their wings, and walk on all fours. Their\r\nskeleton, like that of birds, was very light, yet strong; and the\r\nhollow bones have pores, which show that, as in birds, air could be\r\nintroduced into them from the lungs. This proves a circulation\r\nresembling that of birds, and warm blood. Indeed, in many respects,\r\nthese creatures bridge over the space between the birds and the\r\nreptiles. \"That they lived,\" says Seeley, \"exclusively upon land or in\r\nthe air is improbable, considering the circumstances under which their\r\nremains are found. It is likely that they haunted the sea-shores; and\r\nwhile sometimes rowing themselves over the water with their powerful\r\nwings, used the wing membrane, as does the bat, to encloses the prey\r\nand bring it to the mouth. The large Pterodactyles probably pursued a\r\nmore substantial prey then dragon-flies. Their teeth were well suited\r\nfor fish; but probably fowl and small mammal, and even fruits, made a\r\nvariety in their food. As the lord of the cliff, it may be supposed to\r\nhave taken toll of all animals that could be conquered with tooth and\r\nnail. From its brain, it might be regarded as an intelligent animal.\r\nThe jaws present indications of having been sheathed with a horny\r\ncovering, and some species show a rugose anterior termination of the\r\nsnout, suggestive of fleshy lips like those of the bat, and which may\r\nhave been similarly used to stretch and clean the wing-membrane.\"\r\n\r\n[AE] Seeley: \"_Ornithosauria._\"\r\n\r\nHere, however, perched on the trees, we see true birds. At least they\r\nhave beaks, and are clothed with feathers. But they have very strange\r\nwings, the feathers all secondaries, without any large quills, and\r\nseveral fingers with claws at the angle of the wing, so that though\r\nless useful as wings, they served the double purpose of wing and hand.\r\nMore strange still, the tail was long and flexible, like that of a\r\nlizard, with the feathers arranged in rows along its sides. If the\r\nlizards of this strange and uncertain time had wings like bats, the\r\nbirds had tails and hands like lizards. This was in short the special\r\nage of reptiles, when animals of that class usurped the powers which\r\nrightfully belonged to creatures yet in their nonage, the true birds\r\nand mammals of our modern days, while the birds were compelled to\r\nassume some reptilian traits.\r\n\r\nYet, strange to say, representatives of the higher creatures destined\r\nto inherit the earth at a later date actually existed. Toward the\r\nclose of the Mesozoic we find birds approaching to those of our own\r\nday, and almost at the beginning of the time there were small mammals,\r\nremains of which are found both in the earlier and later formations of\r\nthe Mesozoic, but which never seem to have thriven; at least so far as\r\nthe introduction of large and important species is concerned.\r\nTraversing the Mesozoic woods, we might see here and there little\r\nhairy creatures, which would strike a naturalist as allies of the\r\nmodern bandicoots, kangaroo rats, and myrmecobius of Australia; and\r\ncloser study would confirm this impression, though showing differences\r\nof detail. In their teeth, their size, and general form, and probably\r\nin their pouched or marsupial reproduction, these animals were early\r\nrepresentatives of the smaller quadrupeds of the Austral continent,\r\ncreatures which are not only small but of low organisation in their\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nOne of these mammals, known to us only by its teeth, and well named\r\n_Microlestes_, the \"little thief\" sneaks into existence, so to speak,\r\nin the Trias of Europe, while another very similar, _Dromatherium_,\r\nappears in rocks of similar age in America; and this is the small\r\nbeginning of the great class Mammalia, destined in its quadrupedal\r\nforms to culminate in the elephants and their contemporaries in the\r\nTertiary period. Who that saw them trodden under foot lay the\r\nreptile aristocracy of the Mesozoic could have divined their destiny?\r\nBut, notwithstanding the struggle for existence, the weakest does not\r\nalways \"go to the wall.\" The weak things of this world are often\r\nchosen to confound those that are mighty; and the little quadrupeds of\r\nthe Mesozoic are an allegory. They may typify the true, the good, and\r\nthe hopeful, mildly and humbly asserting themselves in the world that\r\nnow is, in the presence of the dragon monsters of pride and violence,\r\nwhich in the days to come they will overthrow. Physically the Mesozoic\r\nhas passed away, but still exists morally in an age of evil reptiles,\r\nwhose end is as certain as that of the great Dinosaurs of the old\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe Mesozoic mammals are among the most interesting fossils known to\r\nus. In a recent memoir by Professor Owen, thirty-three species are\r\nindicated--all, or nearly all, Marsupial--all small--all closely\r\nallied to modern Australian animals; some herbivorous, some probably\r\ncarnivorous. Owen informs us that these animals are not merely\r\nmarsupials, but marsupials of low grade, a point in which, however,\r\nHuxley differs somewhat in opinion. They are at least not lower then\r\nsome that still exist, and not so low as those lowest of mammals in\r\nModern Australia, the duck-billed platypus and the echidna. Owen\r\nfurther supposes that they were possibly the first mammals, and not\r\nonly the predecessors but the progenitors of the modern marsupials. If\r\nso, we have the singular fact that they not only did not improve\r\nthroughout the vast Mesozoic time, but that they have been in the\r\nprogress of subsequent geological ages expelled out of the great\r\neastern continent, and, with the exception of the American opossums,\r\nbanished, like convicts, to Australia. Yet, notwithstanding their\r\nmultiplied travels and long experiences, they have made little\r\nadvance. It thus seems that the Mesozoic mammals were, from the\r\nevolutionist point of view, a decided failure, and the work of\r\nintroducing mammals had to be done over again in the Tertiary; and\r\nthen, as we shall find, in a very different way. If nothing more,\r\nhowever, the Mesozoic mammals were a mute prophecy of a better time, a\r\nprotest that the age of reptiles was an imperfect age, and that better\r\nthings were in store for the world. Moses seems to have been more\r\nhopeful of them then Owen or even Huxley would have been. He says that\r\nGod \"created\" the great Tanninim, the Dinosaurs and their allies, but\r\nonly \"made\" the mammals of the following creative day; so that when\r\nMicrolestes and his companions quietly and unnoticed presented\r\nthemselves in the Mesozoic, they would appear in some way to have\r\nobviated, in the case of the tertiary mammals, the necessity of a\r\nrepetition of the greater intervention implied in the word \"create.\"\r\nHow that was effected none of us know; but, perhaps, we may know\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE MESOZOIC AGES (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe waters of the Mesozoic period present features quite as remarkable\r\nas the land. In our survey of their teeming multitudes, we indeed\r\nscarcely know where to begin or whither to turn. Let us look first at\r\nthe higher or more noble inhabitants of the waters. And here, just as\r\nin the case of the greater animals of the land, the Mesozoic was\r\nemphatically an age of reptiles. In the modern world the highest\r\nanimals the sea are mammals, and these belong to three great and\r\nsomewhat diverse groups. The first is that of the seals and their\r\nallies, the walruses, sea-lions, etc. The second is that of the whales\r\nand dolphins and porpoises. The third is that of the manatees, or\r\ndugongs. All these creatures breathe air, and bring forth their young\r\nalive, and nourish them with milk. Yet they all live habitually or\r\nconstantly in the water. Between these aquatic mammals and the fishes,\r\nwe have some aquatic reptiles as the turtles, and a few sea-snakes and\r\nsea-lizards, and crocodiles; but the number of these is comparatively\r\nsmall, and in the more temperate latitudes there are scarcely any of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAll this was different in the Mesozoic. In so far as we know, there\r\nwere no representatives of the seals and whales and their allies, but\r\nthere were vast numbers of marine reptiles, and many of these of\r\ngigantic size. Britain at present does not possess one large reptile,\r\nand no marine reptile whatever. In the Mesozoic, in addition to the\r\ngreat Dinosaurs and Pterodactyls of the land, it had at least fifty or\r\nsixty species of aquatic reptiles, besides many turtles. Some of these\r\nwere comparable in size with our modern whales, and armed with\r\ntremendous powers of destruction. America is not relatively rich in\r\nremains of Mesozoic Saurians, yet while the existing fauna of the\r\ntemperate parts of North America is nearly destitute of aquatic\r\nreptiles, with the exception of the turtles, it can boast, according\r\nto Cope's lists, about fifty Mesozoic species, many of them of\r\ngigantic size, and the number of known species is increasing every\r\nyear When it is taken in connection with these statistics, that while\r\nwe know all the modern species, we know but a small percentage of the\r\nfossils, the discrepancy becomes still more startling. Further, from\r\nthe number of specimens and fragments found, it is obvious that these\r\ngreat aquatic saurians were by no means rare; and that some of the\r\nspecies at least must have been very abundant. Could we have taken our\r\npost on the Mesozoic shore, or sailed over its waters, we should have\r\nfound ourselves in the midst of swarms of these strange, often\r\nhideous, and always grotesque creatures.\r\n\r\nLet us consider for a little some of the more conspicuous forms,\r\nreferring to our illustration for their portraits. Every text-book\r\nfigures the well-known types of the genera _Ichthyosaurus_ and\r\n_Plesiosaurus_; we need scarcely, therefore, dwell on them, except to\r\nstate that the catalogues of British fossils include eleven species of\r\nthe former genus and eighteen of the latter, We may, however, notice\r\nsome of the less familiar points of comparison of the two genera. Both\r\nwere aquatic, and probably marine. Both swam by means of paddles; both\r\nwere carnivorous, and probably fed principally upon fishes; both were\r\nproper reptiles, and breathed air, and had large and capacious lungs.\r\nYet with these points in common, no two animals could have been more\r\ndifferent in detail. The Ichthyosaurus had an enormous head, with\r\npowerful jaws, furnished with numerous and strong teeth. Its great\r\neyes, strengthened by a circle of bony plates, exceeded in dimensions,\r\nand probably in power of vision under water, those of any other\r\nanimal, recent or fossil. Its neck was short, its trunk massive, with\r\npaddles or swimming limbs of comparatively small size, and a long\r\ntail, probably furnished with a caudal fin or paddle for propulsion\r\nthrough the water. The Plesiosaur, on the other hand, had a small and\r\ndelicate head, with slender teeth and small eyes. Its neck, of great\r\nlength and with numerous joints, resembled the body of a serpent. Its\r\ntrunk, short, compact, and inflexible, was furnished with large and\r\nstrong paddles, and its tail was too short to be of any service except\r\nfor steering. Compared with the Ichthyosaur, it was what the giraffe\r\nis to the rhinoceros, or the swan to the porpoise. Two fishermen so\r\nvariously and differently fitted for their work it would be difficult\r\nto imagine. But these differences were obviously related to\r\ncorresponding differences in food and habit. The Ichthyosaur was\r\nfitted to struggle with the waves of the stormy sea, to roll therein\r\nlike modern whales and grampuses, to seize and devour great fishes,\r\nand to dive for them into the depths; and its great armour-plated eyes\r\nmust have been well adapted for vision in the deeper waters. The\r\nPlesiosaur, on the contrary, was fitted for comparatively still and\r\nshallow waters; swimming near the surface with its graceful neck\r\ncurving aloft, it could dart at the smaller fishes on the surface, or\r\nstretch its long neck downward in search of those near the bottom. The\r\nIchthyosaurs rolled like porpoises in the surf of the Liassic coral\r\nreefs and the waves beyond; the Plesiosaurs careered gracefully in the\r\nquiet waters within. Both had their beginning at the same time in the\r\nearlier Mesozoic, and both found a common and final grave in its later\r\nsediments. Some of the species were of very moderate size, but there\r\nwere Ichthyosaurs twenty five feet long, and Plesiosaurs at least\r\neighteen feet in length.\r\n\r\nAnother strange and monstrous group of creatures, the Elasmosaurs and\r\ntheir allies, combined the long neck of Plesiosaurs with the swimming\r\ntail of Ichthyosaurs, the latter enormously elongated, so that these\r\nCreatures were sometimes fifty feet in length, and whale-like in the\r\ndimensions of their bodies. It is curious that these composite\r\ncreatures belong to a later period of the Mesozoic then the typical\r\nIchthyosaurs and Plesiosaurs, as if the characters at one time\r\nseparated in these genera had united in their successors.\r\n\r\nOne of the relatives of the Plesiosaurs, the Pliosaur, of which genus\r\nseveral species of great size are known perhaps realized in the\r\nhighest degree possible the idea of a huge marine predaceous reptile.\r\nThe head in some of the species was eight feet in length, armed with\r\nconical teeth a foot long. The neck was not only long, but massive and\r\npowerful, the paddles, four in number, were six or seven feet in\r\nlength and must have urged the vast bulk of the animal, perhaps forty\r\nfeet in extent, through the water with prodigious speed. The capacious\r\nchest and great ribs show a powerful heart and lungs. Imagine such a\r\ncreature raising its huge head twelve feet or more out of water, and\r\nrushing after its prey, impelled with perhaps the most powerful oars\r\never possessed by any animal. We may be thankful that such monsters,\r\nmore terrible then even the fabled sea-serpent, are unknown in our\r\ndays. Buckland, I think, at one time indulged in the _jeu d'esprit_ of\r\nsupposing an Ichthyosaur lecturing on the human skull. \"You will at\r\nonce perceive,\" said the lecturer, \"that the skull before us belonged\r\nto one of the lower orders of animals. The teeth are very\r\ninsignificant, the power of the jaws trifling, and altogether it seems\r\nwonderful how the creature could have procured food.\" We cannot retort\r\non the Ichthyosaur and his contemporaries, for we can see that they\r\nwere admirably fitted for the work they had in hand; but we can see\r\nthat had man been so unfortunate as to have lived in their days, he\r\nmight have been anything but the lord of creation.\r\n\r\nBut there were sea-serpents as well as other monsters in the Mesozoic\r\nseas. Many years ago the Lower Cretaceous beds of St. Peter's Mount,\r\nnear Maestricht, afforded a skull three feet in length, of massive\r\nproportions, and furnished with strong conical teeth, to which the\r\nname _Mosasaurus Camperi_ was given. The skull and other parts of the\r\nskeleton found with it, were held to indicate a large aquatic reptile,\r\nbut its precise position in its class was long a subject of dispute.\r\nFaujas held it to be a crocodile; Camper, Cuvier, and Owen regarded it\r\nas a gigantic lizard. More recently, additional specimens, especially\r\nthose found in the Cretaceous formations of North America, have thrown\r\nnew light upon its structure, and have shown it to present a singular\r\ncombination of the character of serpents, lizards, and of the great\r\nsea saurians already referred to. Some parts of the head and the\r\narticulation of the jaws, in important points resemble those of\r\nserpents, while in other respects the head is that of a gigantic\r\nlizard. The body and tail are greatly lengthened out, having more then\r\na hundred vertebral joints, and in one of the larger species attaining\r\nthe length of eighty feet. The trunk itself is much elongated, and\r\nwith ribs like those of a snake. There are no walking feet, but a pair\r\nof fins or paddles like those of Ichthyosaurus. Cope, who has\r\ndescribed these great creatures as they occur in the Cretaceous of the\r\nUnited States, thus sketches the Mosasaur: \"It was a long and slender\r\nreptile, with a pair of powerful paddles in front, a moderately long\r\nneck, and flat pointed head. The very long tail was flat and deep,\r\nlike that of a great eel, forming a powerful propeller. The arches of\r\nthe vertebral column were more extensively interlocked then in any\r\nother reptiles except the snakes. In the related genus _Clidastes_\r\nthis structure is as fully developed as in the serpents, so that we\r\ncan picture to ourselves its well-known consequences; their rapid\r\nprogress through the water by lateral undulations, their lithe motions\r\non the land, the rapid stroke, the ready coil, or the elevation of the\r\nhead and vertebral column, literally a living pillar, towering above\r\nthe waves or the thickets of the shore swamps.\" As in serpents, the\r\nmouth was wide in its gape, and the lower jaw capable of a certain\r\nseparation from the skull to admit of swallowing large prey. Besides\r\nthis the lower jaw had an additional peculiarity, seen in some snakes,\r\nnamely, a joint in the middle of the jaw enabling its sides to expand,\r\nso that the food might be swallowed \"between the branches of the jaw.\"\r\nPerhaps no creatures more fully realize in their enormous length and\r\nterrible powers the great Tanninim (the stretched-out or extended\r\nreptiles) of the fifth day of the Mosaic record, then the Mosasaurus\r\nand Elasmosaurus. When Mr. Cope showed me, a few years ago, a nearly\r\ncomplete skeleton of Elasmosaurus, which for want of space he had\r\nstretched on a gallery along two sides of a large room, I could not\r\nhelp suggesting to him that the name of the creature should be\r\n_Teinosaurus_[AF] instead of that which he had given. Marsh has\r\nrecently ascertained that the Mosasaurs were covered in part at least\r\nwith bony scales.\r\n\r\n[AF] Heb. _Tanan_; Gr. _Teino_, _Tanuo_; Sansc. _Tanu_; Lat.\r\n_Tendo_.--Ges.

The Reptiles after Hawkins and Cope's Restorations.]\r\n\r\nThese animals may serve as specimens of the reptilian giants of the\r\nMesozoic seas; but before leaving them we must at least invite\r\nattention to the remarkable fact that they were contemporary with\r\nspecies which represent the more common aquatic reptiles of the modern\r\nworld. In other words, the monsters which we have described existed\r\nover and above a far more abundant population of crocodiles and\r\nturtles then the modern waters can boast. The crocodiles were\r\nrepresented both in Europe and America by numerous and large species,\r\nmost of them with long snouts like the modern Gavials, a few with\r\nbroad heads like those of the alligators. The turtles again presented\r\nnot only many species, but most of the aquatic subdivisions of the\r\ngroup known in modern times, as for instance the Emydes or ordinary\r\nfresh-water forms, the snapping turtles, and the soft-shelled turtles.\r\nCope says that the Cretaceous of New Jersey alone affords twenty\r\nspecies, one of them a snapping turtle six feet in length. Owen\r\nrecords above a dozen large species from the Upper Mesozoic of\r\nEngland, and dates the first appearance of the turtles in England\r\nabout the time of the Portland stone, or in the upper half of the\r\nMesozoic; but footprints supposed to be those of turtles are found as\r\nfar back as the Trias. Perhaps no type of modern reptiles is more\r\ncuriously specialized then these animals, yet we thus find them\r\ncontemporaneous with many generalized types, and entering into\r\nexistence perhaps as soon as they. The turtles did not culminate in\r\nthe Mesozoic, but go on to be represented by more numerous and larger\r\nspecies in the Tertiary and Modern. In the case of the crocodiles,\r\nwhile they attained perhaps a maximum toward the end of the Mesozoic,\r\nit was in a peculiar form. The crocodiles of this old time had\r\nvertebrae with a hollow at each end like the fishes, or with a\r\nprojection in the front. At the end of the Mesozoic this was changed,\r\nand they assumed a better-knit back, with joints having a ball behind\r\nand a socket in front. In the Cretaceous age, species having these two\r\nkinds of backbone were contemporaneous. Perhaps this improvement in\r\nthe crocodilian back had something to do with the persistence of this\r\ntype after so many others of the sea-lizards of the Mesozoic had\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\nOf the fishes of the Mesozoic we need only say that they were very\r\nabundant, and consisted of sharks and ganoids of various types, until\r\nnear the close of the period, when the ordinary horny-scaled fishes,\r\nsuch as abound in our present seas, appear to have been introduced.\r\nOne curious point of difference is that the unequally lobed tail of\r\nthe Palæozoic fishes is dropped in the case of the greater part of the\r\nganoids, and replaced by the squarely-cut tail prevalent in modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nIn the sub-kingdom of the Mollusca many important revolutions\r\noccurred. Among the lamp-shells a little _Leptaena_, no bigger then a\r\npea, is the last and depauperated representative of a great Palæozoic\r\nfamily. Another, that of the Spirifers, still shows a few species in\r\nthe Lower Mesozoic. Others, like Rhynchonella, and Terebratula,\r\ncontinue through the period, and extend into the Modern. Passing over\r\nthe ordinary bivalves and sea-snails, which in the main conform to\r\nthose of our own time, we find perhaps the most wonderful changes\r\namong the relatives of the cuttle-fishes and Nautili. As far back as\r\nthe Silurian we find the giant Orthoceratites contemporary with\r\nNautili, very like those of the present ocean. With the close\r\nof the Palæozoic, however, the Orthoceratites and their allies\r\ndisappear, while the Nautili continue, and are reinforced by\r\nmultitudes of new forms of spiral chambered shells, some of them\r\nmore wonderful and beautiful then any of those which either preceded\r\nor followed them. Supreme among these is the great group of the\r\n_Ammonites_,--beautifully spiral shells, thin and pearly like the\r\nNautilus, and chambered like it, so as to serve as a float, but far\r\nmore elaborately constructed, inasmuch as the chambers were not simply\r\ncurved, but crimped and convoluted, so as to give the outer wall much\r\nmore effectual support. This outer wall, too, was worked into\r\nornamental ribs and bands, which not only gave it exquisite beauty,\r\nbut contributed to combine strength to resist pressure with the\r\nlightness necessary to a float. In some of these points it is true the\r\nGyroceras and Goniatites of the Palæozoic partially anticipated them,\r\nbut much less perfectly. The animals which inhabited these shells must\r\nhave been similar to that of Nautilus, but somewhat different in the\r\nproportion of parts. They must have had the same power of rising and\r\nsinking in the water, but the mechanical construction of their shells\r\nwas so much more perfect relatively to this end, that they were\r\nprobably more active and locomotive then the Nautili. They must have\r\nswarmed in the Mesozoic seas, some beds of limestone and shale being\r\nfilled with them; and as many as eight hundred species of this family\r\nare believed to be known, including, however, such forms as the\r\n_Baculites_ or straight Ammonites, bearing to them perhaps a relation\r\nsimilar to that of Orthoceras to Nautilus. Further, some of the\r\nAmmonites are of gigantic size, one species being three feet in\r\ndiameter, while others are very minute. The whole family of\r\nAmmonitids, which begins to be in force in the Trias, disappears at\r\nthe end of the Mesozoic, so that this may be called the special age\r\nof Ammonites as well as of reptiles.\r\n\r\nFurther, this time was likewise distinguished by the introduction of\r\ntrue cuttle-fishes, the most remarkable of which were those furnished\r\nwith the internal supports or \"bones,\" known as _Belemnites_, from a\r\nfancied resemblance to javelins or thunder-bolts, a comparison at\r\nleast as baseless as that often made in England of the Ammonites to\r\nfossil snakes. The shell of the Belemnite is a most curious structure.\r\nIts usual general shape is a pointed cylinder or elongated cone. At\r\ntop it has a deep cavity for the reception of certain of the viscera\r\nof the animal. Below this is a conical series of chambers, the\r\nPhragmacone; and the lower half of the shell is composed of a solid\r\nshelly mass or guard, which, in its structure of radiating fibres and\r\nconcentric layers, resembles a stalactite, or a petrified piece of\r\nexogenous wood. This structure was an internal shell or support like\r\nthose of the modern cuttle-fishes; but it is difficult to account for\r\nits peculiarities, so much more complex then in any existing species.\r\nThe most rational supposition seems to be that it was intended to\r\nserve the triple purpose of a support, a float, and a sinker. Unlike\r\nthe shell of a Nautilus, if thrown into the water it would no doubt\r\nhave, sunk, and with the pointed end first. Consequently, it was not a\r\nfloat simply, but a float and sinker combined, and its effect must\r\nhave been to keep the animal at the bottom, with its head upward. The\r\nBelemnite was therefore an exceptional cuttle-fish, intended to stand\r\nerect on the sea-bottom and probably to dart upward in search of its\r\nprey; for the suckers and hooks with which its arms were furnished\r\nshow that, like other cuttle-fishes, it was carnivorous and\r\npredaceous. The guard may have been less ponderous when recent then in\r\nthe fossil specimens, and in some species it was of small size or\r\nslender, and in others it was hollow. Possibly, also, the soft tissues\r\nof the animal were not dense, and it may have had swimming fins at the\r\nsides. In any case they must have been active creatures, and no doubt\r\ncould dart backward by expelling water from their gill chamber, while\r\nwe know that they had ink-bags, provided with that wonderfully divided\r\npigment, inimitable by art, with which the modern Sepia darkens the\r\nwater to shelter itself from its enemies. The Belemnites must have\r\nswarmed in the Mesozoic seas; and as squids and cuttles now afford\r\nchoice morsels to the larger fishes, so did the Belemnites in their\r\nday. There is evidence that even the great sea-lizards did not disdain\r\nto feed on them. We can imagine a great shoal of these creatures\r\ndarting up and down, seizing with their ten hooked arms their finny or\r\ncrustacean prey. In an instant a great fish or saurian darts down\r\namong them; they blacken the water with a thick cloud of inky\r\nsecretion and disperse on all sides, while their enemy, blindly\r\nseizing a few mouthfuls, returns sullenly to the surface. A great\r\nnumber of species of Belemnites and allied animals have been\r\ndescribed; but it is probable that in naming them too little regard\r\nhas been paid to distinctions of age and sex. The Belemnites were for\r\nthe most part small creatures; but there is evidence that there\r\nexisted with them some larger and more formidable cuttles; and it is\r\nworthy of note that, in several of these, the arms, as in the\r\nBelemnites, were furnished with hooks as well as suckers, an\r\nexceptional arrangement in their modern allies. It is probable that\r\nwhile the four-gilled or shell-bearing cuttles culminated in size and\r\nperfection in the Ammonitids of the Mesozoic, the modern cuttles of\r\nthe two-gilled and shell-less type are grander in dimensions then\r\ntheir Mesozoic predecessors. It is, however, not a little singular\r\nthat a group so peculiar and apparently so well provided with means,\r\nboth of offence and defence, as the Belemnites, should come in and go\r\nout with the Mesozoic, and that the Nautiloid group, after attaining\r\nto the magnitude and complexity of the great Ammonites, should retreat\r\nto a few species of diminutive and simply-constructed Nautili; and in\r\ndoing so should return to one of the old types dating as far back as\r\nthe older Palæozoic, and continuing unchanged through all the\r\nintervening time.\r\n\r\nThe Crustaceans of the Mesozoic had lost all the antique peculiarities\r\nof the older time, and had so much of the aspect of those of the\r\npresent day, that an ordinary observer, if he could be shown a\r\nquantity of Jurassic or Cretaceous crabs, lobsters, and shrimps, would\r\nnot readily recognise the difference, which did not exceed what occurs\r\nin distant geographical regions in the present day. The same remark\r\nmay be made as to the corals of the Mesozoic; and with some\r\nlimitations, as to the star-fishes and sea-urchins, which latter are\r\nespecially numerous and varied in the Cretaceous age. In short, all\r\nthe invertebrate forms of life, and the fishes and reptiles among the\r\nvertebrates, had already attained their maximum elevation in the\r\nMesozoic; and some of them have subsequently sunk considerably in\r\nabsolute as well as relative importance.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the Mesozoic, as indicated in the last chapter, there\r\nhad been several great depressions and re-elevations of the\r\nContinental Areas. But these had been of the same quiet and partial\r\ncharacter with those of the Palæozoic, and it was not until the close\r\nof the Mesozoic time, in the Cretaceous age, that a great and\r\nexceptional subsidence involved for a long period the areas of our\r\npresent continents in a submergence wider and deeper then any that had\r\npreviously occurred since the dry land first rose out of the waters.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows the great chalk beds which appear in the south of\r\nEngland, and which have given its name to the latest age of the\r\nMesozoic. This great deposit of light-coloured and usually soft\r\ncalcareous matter attains in some places to the enormous thickness of\r\n1,000 feet. Nor is it limited in extent. According to Lyell, its\r\nEuropean distribution is from Ireland to the Crimea, a distance of\r\n1,140 geographical miles; and from the south of France to Sweden, a\r\ndistance of 840 geographical miles. Similar rocks, though not in all\r\ncases of the precise nature of chalk, occur extensively in Asia and in\r\nAfrica, and also in North and South America.\r\n\r\nBut what is chalk? It was, though one of the most familiar, one of the\r\nmost inscrutable of rocks, until the microscope revealed its\r\nstructure. The softer varieties, gently grated or kneaded down in\r\nwater, or the harder varieties cut in thin slices, show a congeries of\r\nmicroscopic chambered shells belonging to the humble and simple group\r\nof Protozoa. These shells and their fragments constitute the material\r\nof the ordinary chalk. With these are numerous spicules of sponges and\r\nsilicious cell-walls of the minute one-celled plants called Diatoms.\r\nFurther, the flinty matter of these organisms has by the law of\r\nmolecular attraction been collected into concretions, which are the\r\nflints of the chalk. Such a rock is necessarily oceanic; but more then\r\nthis, it is abyssal. Laborious dredging has shown that similar matter\r\nis now being formed only in the deep bed of the ocean, whither no sand\r\nor mud is drifted from the land, and where the countless hosts of\r\nmicroscopic shell-bearing protozoa continually drop their little\r\nskeletons on the bottom, slowly accumulating a chalky mud or slime.\r\nthat such a rock should occur over vast areas of the continental\r\nplateaus, that both in Europe and America it should be found to cover\r\nthe tops of hills several thousand feet high, and that its thickness\r\nshould amount to several hundreds of feet, are facts which evidence a\r\nrevolution more stupendous perhaps then that at the close of the\r\nPalæozoic. For the first time since the Laurentian, the great\r\ncontinental plateaus changed places with the abysses of the ocean, and\r\nthe successors of the Laurentian Eozoon again reigned on surfaces\r\nwhich through the whole lapse of Palæozoic and Mesozoic time had been\r\nseparated more or less from that deep ocean out of which they rose at\r\nfirst. This great Cretaceous subsidence was different from the\r\ndisturbances of the Permian age. There was at first no crumpling of\r\nthe crust, but merely a slow and long-continued sinking of the land\r\nareas, followed, however, by crumpling of the most stupendous\r\ncharacter, which led at the close of the Cretaceous and in the earlier\r\nTertiary to the formation of what are now the greatest mountain chains\r\nin the world. As examples may be mentioned the Himalaya, the Andes,\r\nand the Alps, on all which the deep-sea beds of the Cretaceous are\r\nseen at great elevations. In Europe this depression was almost\r\nuniversal, only very limited areas remaining out of water. In America\r\na large tract remained above water in the region of the Appalachians.\r\nThis gives us some clue to the phenomena. The great Permian collapse\r\nled to the crumpling-up of the Appalachians and the Urals, and the\r\nolder hills of Western Europe. The Cretaceous collapse led to the\r\ncrumpling of the great N.W. and S.E. chain of the Rocky Mountains and\r\nAndes, and to that of the east and west chains of the south of Asia\r\nand Europe. The cause was probably in both cases the same; but the\r\ncrust gave way in a different part, and owing to this there was a\r\ngreater amount of submergence of our familiar continental plateaus in\r\nthe Cretaceous then in the Permian.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable indication of the nature of the Cretaceous\r\nsubsidence, is the occurrence of beds filled with grains of the\r\nmineral Glauconite or \"green-sand.\" These grains are not properly\r\nsand, but little concretions, which form in the bottom of the deep\r\nsea, often filling and taking casts of the interior and fine tubes of\r\nForaminiferal shells. Now this Glauconite, a hydrous silicate of iron\r\nand potash, is akin to similar materials found filling the pores of\r\nfossils in Silurian beds. It is also akin to the Serpentine filling\r\nthe pores of Eozoon in the Laurentian. Such materials are formed only\r\nin the deeper parts of the ocean, and apparently most abundantly where\r\ncurrents of warm water are flowing at the surface, as in the area of\r\nthe Gulf Stream. Thus, not only in the prevalence of Foraminifera, but\r\nin the formation of hydrous silicates, does the Cretaceous recall the\r\nLaurentian. Such materials had no doubt been forming, and such animals\r\nliving in the ocean depths, all through the intervening ages, but with\r\nthe exception of a few and merely local instances, we know nothing of\r\nthem, till the great subsidence and re-elevation of the Cretaceous\r\nagain allows them to ascend to the continental plateaus, and again\r\nintroduces us to this branch of the world-making process.\r\n\r\nThe attention recently drawn to these facts by the researches of Dr.\r\nCarpenter and others, and especially the similarity in mineral\r\ncharacter and organic remains of some of the deposits now forming in\r\nthe Atlantic and those of the chalk, have caused it to be affirmed\r\nthat in the bed of the Atlantic these conditions of life and deposit\r\nhave continued from the Cretaceous up to the present time, or as it\r\nhas been expressed, that \"we are still living in the Cretaceous\r\nepoch.\" Now, this is true or false just as we apply the statement. We\r\nhave seen that the distinction between abyssal areas, continental\r\noceanic plateaus, and land surfaces has extended through the whole\r\nlapse of geological time. In this broad sense we may be said to be\r\nstill living in the Laurentian epoch. In other words, the whole plan\r\nof the earth's development is one and the same, and each class of\r\ngeneral condition once introduced is permanent somewhere. But in\r\nanother important sense we are not living in the Cretaceous epoch;\r\notherwise the present site of London would be a thousand fathoms deep\r\nin the ocean; the Ichthyosaurs and Ammonites would be disporting\r\nthemselves in the water, and the huge Dinosaurs and strange\r\nPterodactyls living on the land. The Italian peasant is still in many\r\nimportant points living in the period of the old Roman Empire. The\r\nArab of the desert remains in the Patriarchal period, and there are\r\nsome tribes not yet beyond the primitive age of stone. But the world\r\nmoves, nevertheless, and the era of Victoria is not that of the\r\nPlantagenets or of Julius Cæsar. So while we may admit that certain of\r\nthe conditions of the Cretaceous seas still prevail in the bed of the\r\npresent ocean, we must maintain that nearly all else is changed, and\r\nthat the very existence of the partial similarity is of itself the\r\nmost conclusive proof of the general want of resemblance, and of the\r\nthorough character of the changes which have occurred.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the Cretaceous subsidence must have been very great.\r\nWe do not know the rate at which the Foraminifera accumulate\r\ncalcareous mud. In some places, where currents heap up their shells,\r\nthey may be gathered rapidly; but on the average of the ocean bed,\r\nafoot of such material must indicate the lapse of ages very long when\r\ncompared with those of modern history. We need not wonder, therefore,\r\nthat while some forms of deep-sea Cretaceous life, especially of the\r\nlower grades, seem to have continued to our time, the inhabitants of\r\nthe shallow waters and the land have perished; and that the Neozoic or\r\nTertiary period introduces us to a new world of living beings. I say\r\nwe need not wonder; yet there is no reason why we should expect this\r\nas a necessary consequence. As the Cretaceous deluge rose over the\r\ncontinents of the Mesozoic, the great sea saurians might have\r\nfollowed. Those of the land might have retreated to the tracts still\r\nremaining out of water, and when the dry land again appeared in the\r\nearlier Tertiary, they might again have replenished the earth, and we\r\nmight thus have truly been living in the Reptilian age up to this day.\r\nBut it was not so. The old world again perished, and the dawn of the\r\nTertiary shows to us at once the dynasties of the Mammalian age, which\r\nwas to culminate in the introduction of man. With the great Cretaceous\r\nsubsidence the curtain falls upon the age of reptiles, and when it\r\nrises again, after the vast interval occupied in the deposition of the\r\ngreen-sand and chalk, the scene has entirely changed. There are new\r\nmountains and new plains, forests of different type, and animals such\r\nas no previous age had seen.\r\n\r\nHow strange and inexplicable is this perishing of types in the\r\ngeological ages! Some we could well spare. We would not wish to have\r\nour coasts infested by terrible sea saurians, or our forests by\r\ncarnivorous Dinosaurs. Yet why should these tyrants of creation so\r\nutterly disappear without waiting for us to make war on them? Other\r\ntypes we mourn. How glorious would the hundreds of species of\r\nAmmonites have shone in the cases of our museums, had they still\r\nlived! What images of beauty would they have afforded to the poets who\r\nhave made so much of the comparatively humble Nautilus! How perfectly,\r\ntoo, were they furnished with all those mechanical appliances for\r\ntheir ocean life, which are bestowed only with a niggardly hand on\r\ntheir successors! Nature gives us no explanation of the mystery.\r\n\r\n    \"From scarped cliff and quarried stone,\r\n     She cries--'A thousand types are gone.'\"\r\n\r\nBut why or how one was taken and another left she is silent, and I\r\nbelieve must continue to be so, because the causes, whether efficient\r\nor final, are beyond her sphere. If we wish for a full explanation, we\r\nmust leave Nature, and ascend to the higher domain of the Spiritual.\r\n\r\nCONDENSED TABULAR VIEW OF THE AGES AND PERIODS OF THE MESOZOIC.\r\n\r\n  Key to Symbols\r\n\r\n  ### Duration of Ammonites and Belemnites.\r\n  === Ages of Cycads and Pines.\r\n  --- Beginning of Age of Angiospermous Exogens.\r\n  +++ \"And God created great reptiles, and every living moving\r\n       thing which the waters brought forth abundantly, and every\r\n       flying creature after its kind.\"\r\n\r\n  Time.\r\n    Ages.

Yet we must not forget to consider that even in the\r\nCretaceous itself there were new features beginning to appear. Let us\r\nnote in this way, in the first place, the introduction of the familiar\r\ngeneric forms of exogenous trees. Next we may mention the decided\r\nprevalence of the modern types of coral animals and of a great number\r\nof modern generic forms of mollusks. Then we have the establishment of\r\nthe modern tribes of lobsters and crabs, and the appearance of nearly\r\nall the orders of insects. Among vertebrates, the ordinary fishes are\r\nnow introduced. Modern orders of reptiles, as the crocodiles and\r\nchelonians, had already appeared, and the first mammals. Henceforth\r\nthe progress of organic nature lies chiefly in the dropping of many\r\nMesozoic forms and in the introduction of the higher tribes of mammals\r\nand of man.\r\n\r\n[AG] The former name is related to Palæozoic and Mesozoic, the latter\r\nto the older terms Primary and Secondary. For the sake of euphony we\r\nshall use both. The term Neozoic was proposed by Edward Forbes for the\r\nMesozoic and Cainozoic combined; but I use it here as a more\r\neuphonious and accurate term for the Cainozoic alone.\r\n\r\nIt is further to be observed that the new things introduced in the\r\nlater Mesozoic came in little by little in the progress of the period,\r\nand anticipated the great physical changes occurring at its close. On\r\nthe other hand, while many family and even generic types pass over\r\nfrom the Mesozoic to the earlier Tertiary, very few species do so. It\r\nwould seem, therefore, as if changes of species were more strictly\r\nsubordinate to physical revolutions then were changes of genera and\r\norders--these last overriding under different specific forms many\r\nminor vicissitudes, and only in part being overwhelmed in the grander\r\nrevolutions of the earth.\r\n\r\nBoth in Europe and America there is evidence of great changes of level\r\nat the beginning of the Tertiary. In the west of Europe beds often of\r\nshallow-water or even fresh-water origin fill the hollows in the bent\r\nCretaceous strata. This is manifestly the case with the formations of\r\nthe London and Paris basins, contemporaneous but detached deposits of\r\nthe Tertiary age, lying in depressions of the chalk. Still this does\r\nnot imply much want of conformity, and according to the best explorers\r\nof those Alpine regions in which both the Mesozoic and Tertiary beds\r\nhave been thrown up to great elevations, they are in the main\r\nconformable to one another. Something of the same kind occurs in\r\nAmerica. On the Atlantic coast the marine beds of the Older Tertiary\r\ncover the Cretaceous, and little elevation seems to have occurred\r\nFarther west the elevation increases, and in the upper part of the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi it amounts to 1700 feet. Still farther west,\r\nin the region of the Rocky Mountains, there is evidence of elevation\r\nto the extent of as much as 7000 feet. Throughout all these regions\r\nscarcely any disturbance of the old Cretaceous sea-bottom seems to\r\nhave occurred until after the deposition of the older Tertiary, so\r\nthat there was first a slow and general elevation of the Cretaceous\r\nocean bottom, succeeded by gigantic folds and fractures, and extensive\r\nextravasations of the bowels of the earth in molten rocks, in the\r\ncourse of the succeeding Tertiary age. These great physical changes\r\ninaugurated the new and higher life of the Tertiary, just as the\r\nsimilar changes in the Permian did that of the Mesozoic.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of these movements consisted of a great and gradual\r\nelevation of the northern parts of both the Old and New Continents out\r\nof the sea, whereby a much greater land surface was produced, and such\r\nchanges of depth and direction of currents in the ocean as must have\r\nvery much modified the conditions of marine life. The effect of all\r\nthese changes in the aggregate was to cause a more varied and variable\r\nclimate, and to convert vast areas previously tenanted by marine\r\nanimals into the abodes of animals and plants of the land, and of\r\nestuaries, lakes, and shallow waters. Still, however, very large\r\nareas now continental were under the sea. As the Tertiary period\r\nadvanced, these latter areas were elevated, and in many cases were\r\nfolded up into high mountains. This produced further changes of\r\nclimate and habitat of animals, and finally brought our continents\r\ninto all the variety of surface which they now present, and which fits\r\nthem so well for the habitation of the higher animals and of man.\r\n\r\nThe thoughtful reader will observe that it follows from the above\r\nstatements that the partial distribution and diversity in different\r\nlocalities which apply to the deposits of such ages as the Permian and\r\nthe Trias apply also to the earlier Tertiary; and as the continents,\r\nnotwithstanding some dips under water, have retained their present\r\nforms since the beginning of the Tertiary, it follows that these beds\r\nare more definitely related to existing geographical conditions then\r\nare those of the older periods, and that the more extensive marine\r\ndeposits of the Tertiary are, to a great extent, unknown to us. This\r\nhas naturally led to some difficulty in the classification of Neozoic\r\ndeposits--those of some of the Tertiary ages being very patchy and\r\nirregular, while others spread very widely. In consequence of this,\r\nSir Charles Lyell, to whom we owe very much of our definite knowledge\r\nof this period, has proposed a subdivision based on the percentage of\r\nrecent and fossil animals. In other words, he takes it for granted\r\nthat a deposit which contains more numerous species of animals still\r\nliving then another, may be judged on that account to be more recent.\r\nSuch a mode of estimation is, no doubt, to some extent arbitrary; but\r\nin the main, when it can be tested by the superposition of deposits,\r\nit has proved itself reliable. Further, it brings before us this\r\nremarkable fact, that while in the older periods all the animals whose\r\nremains we find are extinct as species, so soon as we enter on the\r\nNeozoic we find some which still continue to our time--at first only a\r\nvery few, but in later and later beds in gradually increasing\r\npercentage, till the fossil and extinct wholly disappear in the recent\r\nand living.\r\n\r\nThe Lyellian classification of the Tertiary will therefore stand as in\r\nthe following table, bearing in mind that the percentage of fossils is\r\ntaken from marine forms, and mainly from mollusks, and that the system\r\nhas in some cases been modified by stratigraphical evidence:--\r\n\r\n                { Post-pliocene, including that which immediately\r\n                {   precedes the Modern. In this the shells, etc.,\r\n                {   are recent, the Mammalia in part extinct.\r\n                {\r\n                { Pliocene, or more recent age. In this the\r\n                {   majority of shells found are recent in the\r\n  Tertiary, or  {   upper beds. In the lower beds the extinct\r\n  Neozoic Time. {   become predominant.\r\n                {\r\n                { Miocene, or less recent. In this the large\r\n                {   majority of shells found are extinct.\r\n                {\r\n                { Eocene, the dawn of the recent. In this only\r\n                {   a few recent shells occur.\r\n\r\nIf we attempt to divide the Tertiary time into ages corresponding to\r\nthose of the older times, we are met by the difficulty that as the\r\ncontinents have retained their present forms and characters to a great\r\nextent throughout this time, we fail to find those evidences of\r\nlong-continued submergences of the whole continental plateaus, or very\r\nlarge portions of them, which we have found so very valuable in the\r\nPalæozoic and Mesozoic. In the Eocene, however, we shall discover one\r\nvery instructive case in the great Nummulitic Limestone. In the\r\nMiocene and Pliocene the oscillations seem to have been slight and\r\npartial. In the Post-pliocene we have the great subsidence of the\r\nglacial drift; but that seems to have been a comparatively rapid dip,\r\nthough of long duration when measured by human history; not allowing\r\ntime for the formation of great limestones, but only of fossiliferous\r\nsands and clays, which require comparatively short time for their\r\ndeposition If then we ask as to the duration of the Neozoic, I answer\r\nthat we have not a definite measure of its ages, if it had any; and\r\nthat it is possible that the Neozoic may have as yet had but one age,\r\nwhich closed with the great drift period, and that we are now only in\r\nthe beginning of its second age. Some geologists, impressed with this\r\ncomparative shortness of the Tertiary, connect it with Mesozoic,\r\ngrouping both together. This, however, is obviously unnatural. The\r\nMesozoic time certainly terminated with the Cretaceous, and what\r\nfollows belongs to a distinct aeon.\r\n\r\nBut we must now try to paint the character of this new and peculiar\r\ntime; and this may perhaps be best done in the following sketches: 1.\r\nThe seas of the Eocene. 2. Mammals from the Eocene to the Modern. 3.\r\nTertiary floras. 4. The Glacial period. 5. The Advent of Man.\r\n\r\nThe great elevation of the continents which closed the Cretaceous was\r\nfollowed by a partial and unequal subsidence, affecting principally\r\nthe more southern parts of the land of the northern hemisphere. Thus,\r\na wide sea area stretched across all the south of Europe and Asia, and\r\nseparated the northern part of North America from what of land existed\r\nin the southern hemisphere. This is the age of the great Nummulitic\r\nLimestones of Europe, Africa, and Asia, and the Orbitoidal Limestones\r\nof North America. The names are derived from the prevalence of certain\r\nforms of those humble shell-bearing protozoa which we first met with\r\nin the Laurentian, and which we have found to be instrumental in\r\nbuilding up the chalk, the _Foraminifera_ of zoologists. (Fig. p.\r\n243.) But in the Eocene the species of the chalk were replaced by\r\ncertain broad flat forms, the appearance of which is expressed by the\r\nterm nummulite, or money-stone; the rock appearing to be made up of\r\nfossils, somewhat resembling shillings, sixpences, or three-penny\r\npieces, according to the size of the shells, each of which includes a\r\nvast number of small concentric chambers, which during life were\r\nfilled with the soft jelly of the animal. The nummulite limestone was\r\nundoubtedly oceanic, and the other shells contained in it are marine\r\nspecies. After what we have already seen we do not need this\r\nlimestone to convince us of the continent-building powers of the\r\noceanic protozoa; but the distribution of these limestones, and the\r\nelevation which they attain, furnish the most striking proofs that we\r\ncan imagine of the changes which the earth's crust has undergone in\r\ntimes geologically modern, and also of the extreme newness of man and\r\nhis works. Large portions of those countries which constitute the\r\nearliest seats of man in Southern Europe, Northern Africa, and Western\r\nand Southern Asia, are built upon the old nummulitic sea-bottom. The\r\nEgyptians and many other ancient nations quarried it for their oldest\r\nbuildings. In some of these regions it attains a thickness of several\r\nthousand feet, evidencing a lapse of time in its accumulation equal to\r\nthat implied in the chalk itself. In the Swiss Alps it reaches a\r\nheight above the sea of 10,000 feet, and it enters largely into the\r\nstructure of the Carpathians and Pyrenees. In Thibet it has been\r\nobserved at an elevation of 16,500 feet above the sea. Thus we learn\r\nthat at a time no more geologically remote then the Eocene Tertiary,\r\nlands now of this great elevation were in the bottom of the deep sea;\r\nand this not merely for a little time, but during a time sufficient\r\nfor the slow accumulation of hundreds of feet of rock, made up of the\r\nshells of successive generations of animals. If geology presented to\r\nus no other revelation then this one fact, it would alone constitute\r\none of the most stupendous pictures in physical geography which could\r\nbe presented to the imagination. I beg leave here to present to the\r\nreader a little illustration of the limestone-making Foraminifera of\r\nthe Cretaceous and Eocene seas. In the middle above is a nummulite of\r\nthe natural size. Below is another, sliced to show its internal\r\nchambers. At one side is a magnified section of the common building\r\nstone of Paris, the milioline limestone of the Eocene, so called from\r\nits immense abundance of microscopic shells of the genus Miliolina. At\r\nthe other side is a magnified section of one of the harder varieties\r\nof chalk, ground so thin as to become transparent,[AH] and mounted in\r\nCanada balsam. It shows many microscopic chambered shells of\r\nForaminifera. These may serve as illustrations of the functions of\r\nthese humble inhabitants of the sea as accumulators of calcareous\r\nmatter. It is further interesting to remark that some of the beds of\r\nnummulitic limestone are so completely filled with these shells, that\r\nwe might from detached specimens suppose that they belonged to\r\nsea-bottoms whereon no other form of life was present. Yet some beds\r\nof this age are remarkably rich in other fossils. Lyell states that as\r\nmany as six hundred species of shells have been found in the principal\r\nlimestone of the Paris basin alone; and the lower Eocene beds afford\r\nremains of fishes, of reptiles, of birds, and of mammals. Among the\r\nlatter are the bones of gigantic whales, of which one of the most\r\nremarkable is the Zeuglodon of Alabama, a creature sometimes seventy\r\nfeet in length, and which replaces in the Tertiary the great\r\nElasmosaurs and Ichthyosaurs of the Mesozoic, marking the advent, even\r\nin the sea, of the age of Mammals as distinguished from the age of\r\nReptiles.\r\n\r\n[AH] As for instance that of the Giant's Causeway, Antrim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORAMINIFERAL ROCK-BUILDERS.\r\n\r\nA. Nummulites lævigata--Eocene.\r\n\r\nB. The same, showing chambered interior.\r\n\r\nC. Milioline limestone, magnified--Eocene, Paris.\r\n\r\nD. Hard Chalk, section magnified--Cretaceous.]\r\n\r\nThis fact leads us naturally to consider in the second place the\r\nmammalia, and other land animals of the Tertiary. At the beginning of\r\nthe period we meet with that higher group of mammals, not pouched,\r\nwhich now prevails. Among the oldest of these Tertiary beasts are\r\n_Coryphodon_, an animal related to the Modern Tapirs, and _Arctocyon_,\r\na creature related to the bears and racoons. These animals represent\r\nrespectively the Pachyderms, or thick-skinned mammals, and the\r\nordinary Carnivora. Contemporary with or shortly succeeding these,\r\nwere species representing the Rodents, or gnawing animals, and many\r\nother creatures of the group Pachydermata, allied to the Modern Tapirs\r\nand Hogs, as well as several additional carnivorous quadrupeds. Thus\r\nat the very beginning of the Tertiary period we enter on the age of\r\nmammals, It may be well, however, to take these animals somewhat in\r\nchronological order.\r\n\r\nIf the old Egyptian, by quarrying the nummulite limestone, bore\r\nunconscious testimony to the recent origin of man (whose remains are\r\nwholly absent from the Tertiary deposits), so did the ancient Britons\r\nand Gauls, when they laid the first rude foundations of future\r\ncapitals on the banks of the themes and of the Seine. Both cities lie\r\nin basins of Eocene Tertiary, occupying hollows in the chalk. Under\r\nLondon there is principally a thick bed of clay, the \"London clay\"\r\nattaining a thickness of five hundred feet. This bed is obviously\r\nmarine, containing numerous species of sea shells; but it must have\r\nbeen deposited near land, as it also holds many fossil fruits and\r\nother remains of plants to which we shall refer in the sequel, and the\r\nbones of several species of large animals. Among these the old\r\nreptiles of the Mesozoic are represented by the vertebrae of a\r\nsupposed \"sea snake\" (Palæophis) thirteen feet long, and species of\r\ncrocodile allied both to the alligators and the gavials. But besides\r\nthese there are bones of several animals allied to the hog and tapir,\r\nand also a species of opossum, These remains must be drift carcases\r\nfrom neighbouring shores, and they show first the elevation of the\r\nold deep-sea bottom represented by the chalk, so that part of it\r\nbecame dry land; next, the peopling of that land by tribes of animals\r\nand plants unknown to the Mesozoic; and lastly, that a warm climate\r\nmust have existed, enabling England at this time to support many types\r\nof animals and plants now proper to intertropical regions. As Lyell\r\nwell remarks, it is most interesting to observe that these beds belong\r\nto the beginning of the Tertiary, that they are older then those great\r\nnummulite limestones to which we have referred, and that they are\r\nolder then the principal mountain chains of Europe and Asia. They show\r\nthat no sooner was the Cretaceous sea dried from off the new land,\r\nthen there were abundance of animals and plants ready to occupy it,\r\nand these not the survivors of the flora and fauna of the Wealden, but\r\na new creation. The mention of the deposit last named places this in a\r\nstriking light. We have seen that the Wealden beds, under the chalk,\r\nrepresent a Mesozoic estuary, and in it we have the remains of the\r\nanimals and plants of the land that then was. The great Cretaceous\r\nsubsidence intervened, and in the London clay we have an estuary of\r\nthe Eocene. But if we pass through the galleries of a museum where\r\nthese formations are represented, though we know that both existed in\r\nthe same locality under a warm climate, we see that they belong to two\r\ndifferent worlds, the one to that of the Dinosaurs, the Ammonites, the\r\nCycads, and the minute Marsupials of the Mesozoic, the other to that\r\nof the Pachyderms, the Palms, and the Nautili of the Tertiary.\r\n\r\nThe London clay is lower Eocene; but in the beds of the Isle of Wight\r\nand neighbouring parts of the South of England, we have the middle and\r\nupper members of the series. They are not, however, so largely\r\ndeveloped as in the Paris basin, where, resting on the equivalent of\r\nthe London clay, we have a thick marine limestone, the Calcaire\r\nGrossier, abounding in marine remains, and in some beds composed of\r\nshells of foraminifera. The sea in which this limestone was deposited,\r\na portion no doubt of the great Atlantic area of the period, became\r\nshallow, so that beds of sand succeeded those of limestone, and\r\nfinally it was dried up into lake basins, in which gypsum, magnesian\r\nsediments, and siliceous limestone were deposited. These lakes or\r\nponds must at some period have resembled the American \"salt-licks,\"\r\nand were no doubt resorted to by animals from all the surrounding\r\ncountry in search of the saline mud and water which they afforded.\r\nHence in some marly beds intervening between the layers of gypsum,\r\nnumerous footprints occur, exactly like those already noticed in the\r\nTrias. Had there been a Nimrod in those days to watch with bow or\r\nboomerang by the muddy shore, he would have seen herds of heavy\r\nshort-legged and three-hoofed monsters (Palæotherium), with large\r\nheads and long snouts, probably scantily covered with sleek hair, and\r\nclosely resembling the Modern Tapirs of South America and India,\r\nlaboriously wading through the mud, and grunting with indolent delight\r\nas they rolled themselves in the cool saline slime. Others more light\r\nand graceful, combining some features of the antelope with those of\r\nthe Tapir (Anoplotherium) ran in herds over the drier ridges, or\r\nsometimes timidly approached the treacherous clay, tempted by the\r\nsaline waters. Other creatures representing the Modern Damans or\r\nConies--\"feeble folk\" which, with the aspect of hares, have the\r\nstructure of Pachyderms--were also present. Creatures of these types\r\nconstituted the great majority of the animals of the Parisian Eocene\r\nlakes; but there were also Carnivorous animals allied to the hyæna,\r\nthe wolf, and the opossum, which prowled along the shores by night to\r\nseize unwary wanderers, or to prey on the carcases of animals mired in\r\nthe sloughs. Wading birds equal in size to the ostrich also stalked\r\nthrough the shallows, and tortoises crawled over the mud.\r\n\r\nLyell mentions the discovery of some bones of one of these gigantic\r\nbirds (Gastornis) in a bed of the rolled chalk flints which form the\r\nbase of the Paris series, resting immediately on the chalk; one of the\r\nfirst inhabitants perhaps to people some island of chalk just emerged\r\nfrom the waters, and under which lay the bones of the mighty\r\nDinosaurs, and in which were embedded those of sea birds that had\r\nranged, like the albatross and petrel, over the wide expanse of the\r\nCretaceous ocean. These waders, however, like the tortoises and\r\ncrocodiles and small marsupial mammals, form a link of connection in\r\ntype at least between the Eocene and the Cretaceous, for bones of\r\nwading birds have been found in the Greensands indicating their\r\nexistence before the close of the Mesozoic.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Baron Cuvier in the bones collected in the quarries\r\nof Montmartre were regarded as an astonishing triumph of comparative\r\nanatomy; and familiar as we now are with similar and yet more\r\ndifficult achievements, we can yet afford to regard with admiration\r\nthe work of the great French naturalist as it is recorded in its\r\ncollected form in his \"Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles,\"\r\npublished in 1812. His clear and philosophical views as to the plan\r\nperceptible in nature, his admirable powers of classification, his\r\nacute perception of the correlation of parts in animals, his nice\r\ndiscrimination of the resemblances and differences of fossil and\r\nrecent structures, and of the uses of these,--all mark him as one of\r\nthe greatest minds ever devoted to the study of natural science. It is\r\nobvious, that had his intellect been occupied by the evolutionist\r\nmetaphysics which pass for natural science with too many in our day,\r\nhe would have effected comparatively little; and instead of the\r\nmagnificent museum in the \"Règne Animal\" and the \"Ossemens Fossiles,\"\r\nwe might have had wearisome speculations on the derivation of species.\r\nIt is reason for profound thankfulness that it was not so; and also\r\nthat so many great observers and thinkers of our day, like Sedgwick,\r\nMurchison, Lyell, Owen, Dana, and Agassiz, have been allowed to work\r\nout their researches almost to completion before the advent of those\r\npoisoned streams and mephitic vapours which threaten the intellectual\r\nobscuration of those who should be their successors.\r\n\r\nIf we pass from the Eocene to the Miocene, still confining ourselves\r\nmainly to mammalian life, we find three remarkable points of\r\ndifference--(1) Whereas the Eocene mammals are remarkable for\r\nadherence to one general type, viz., that group of pachyderms most\r\nregular and complete in its dentition, we now find a great number of\r\nmore specialised and peculiar forms; (2) We find in the latter period\r\na far greater proportion of large carnivorous animals; (3) We find\r\nmuch greater variety of mammals then either in the Eocene or the\r\nModern, and a remarkable abundance of species of gigantic size. The\r\nMiocene is thus apparently the culminating age of the mammalia, in so\r\nfar as physical development is concerned; and this, as we shall find,\r\naccords with its remarkably genial climate and exuberant vegetation.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the beds of this age present, for the first time, examples\r\nof the monkeys, represented by two generic types, both of them\r\napparently related to the modern long-armed species, or Gibbons. Among\r\ncarnivorous animals we have cat-like creatures, one of which is the\r\nterrible _Machairodus_, distinguished from all modern animals of its\r\ngroup by the long sabre-shaped canines of its upper jaw, fitting it to\r\npull down and destroy those large pachyderms which could have easily\r\nshaken off a lion or a tiger. Here also we have the elephants,\r\nrepresented by several species now extinct; the mastodon, a great,\r\ncoarsely-built, hog-like elephant, some species of which had tusks\r\nboth in the upper and lower jaw; the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, and\r\nthe horse, all of extinct species. We have also giraffes, stags, and\r\nantelopes, the first ruminants known to us, and a great variety of\r\nsmaller and less noteworthy creatures. Here also, for the first time,\r\nwe find the curious and exceptional group of Edentates, represented by\r\na large ant-eater. Of all the animals of the European Miocene, the\r\nmost wonderful and unlike any modern beast, is the Dinotherium, found\r\nin the Miocene of Epplesheim in Germany; and described by Kaup. Some\r\ndoubt rests on the form and affinities of the animal; but we may\r\nreasonably take it, as restored by its describer, and currently\r\nreproduced in popular books, to have been a quadruped of somewhat\r\nelephantine form. Some years ago, however, a huge haunch bone,\r\nsupposed to belong to this creature, was discovered in the South of\r\nFrance; and from this it was inferred that the Dinothere may have been\r\na marsupial or pouched animal, perhaps allied in form and habits to\r\nthe kangaroos. The skull is three feet four inches in length; and when\r\nprovided with its soft parts, including a snout or trunk in front, it\r\nmust have been at least five or six feet long. Such a head, if it\r\nbelonged to a quadruped of ordinary proportions, must represent an\r\nanimal as large in proportion to our elephant as an elephant to an ox.\r\nBut its size is not its most remarkable feature. It has two large\r\ntusks firmly implanted in strong bony sockets; but they are attached\r\nto the end of the lower jaw and point downward at right angles to it,\r\nso that the lower jaw forms a sort of double-pointed pickaxe of great\r\nsize and strength. This might have been used as a weapon; or, if the\r\ncreature was aquatic, as a grappling iron to hold by the bank, or by\r\nfloating timber; but more probably it was a grubbing-hoe for digging\r\nup roots or loosening the bases of trees which the animal might\r\nafterward pull down to devour them. However this may be, the creature\r\nlaboured under the mechanical disadvantage of having to lift an\r\nimmense weight in the process of mastication, and of being unable to\r\nbring its mouth to the ground, or to bite or grasp anything with the\r\nfront of its jaws. To make up for this, it had muscles of enormous\r\npower on the sides of the head attached to great projecting processes;\r\nand it had a thick but flexible proboscis, to place in its mouth the\r\nfood grubbed up by its tusks. Taken altogether, the Dinothere is\r\nperhaps the most remarkable of mammals, fossil or recent; and if the\r\nrest of its frame were as extraordinary as its skull, we have probably\r\nas yet but a faint conception of its peculiarities. We may apply to\r\nit, with added force, the admiring ejaculation of Job, when he\r\ndescribes the strength of the hippopotamus, \"He is the chief of the\r\nways of God. He who made him, gave him his sword.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MIOCENE MAMMALS OF THE EASTERN CONTINENT.\r\n\r\nIn the foreground _Elephas_, _Ganesa_, _Hydracotherium_,\r\n_Dinotherium_, _Machairodus_, _Mastodon longirostris_.

Sequoias and Fan Palm in the background.]\r\n\r\nIn Asia, the Siwalik hills afforded to Falconer and Cautley one of the\r\nmost remarkable exhibitions of Miocene animals in the world. These\r\nhills form a ridge subordinate to the Himalayan chain; and rise to a\r\nheight of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. In the Miocene period, they were sandy\r\nand pebbly shores and banks lying at the foot of the then infant\r\nHimalayas, which, with the table-lands to the north, probably formed a\r\nsomewhat narrow east and west continental mass or large island. As a\r\nmere example of the marvellous fauna which inhabited this Miocene\r\nland, it has afforded remains of seven species of elephants,\r\nmastodons, and allied animals; one of them, the _E. Ganesa_, with\r\ntusks ten feet and a half long, and twenty-six inches in circumference\r\nat the base. Besides these there are five species of rhinoceros, three\r\nof horse and allied animals, four or more of hippopotamus, and species\r\nof camel, giraffe, antelope, sheep, ox, and many other genera, as well\r\nas numerous large and formidable beasts of prey. There is also an\r\nostrich; and, among other reptiles, a tortoise having a shell twelve\r\nfeet in length, and this huge roof must have covered an animal\r\neighteen feet long and seven feet high. Among the more remarkable of\r\nthe Siwalik animals is the _Sivatherium_, a gigantic four-horned\r\nantelope or deer, supposed to have been of elephantine size, and of\r\ngreat power and swiftness; and to have presented features connecting\r\nthe ruminants and pachyderms. Our restoration of this creature is to\r\nsome extent conjectural; and a remarkably artistic, and probably more\r\naccurate, restoration of the animal has recently been published by\r\nDr. Murie, in the Geological Magazine. We justly regard the Mammalian\r\nfauna of modern India as one of the noblest in the world; but it is\r\npaltry in comparison with that of the much more limited Miocene India;\r\neven if we suppose, contrary to all probability, that we know most of\r\nthe animals of the latter. But if we consider the likelihood that we\r\ndo not yet know a tenth of the Miocene animals, the contrast becomes\r\nvastly greater.\r\n\r\nMiocene America is scarcely behind the Old World in the development of\r\nits land animals. From one locality in Nebraska, Leidy described in\r\n1852 fifteen species of large quadrupeds; and the number has since\r\nbeen considerably increased. Among these are species of Rhinoceros,\r\nPalæotherium, and Machairodus; and one animal, the Titanotherium,\r\nallied to the European Anoplothere, is said to have attained a length\r\nof eighteen feet and a height of nine, its jaws alone being five feet\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration, I have grouped some of the characteristic\r\nMammalian forms of the Miocene, as we can restore them from their\r\nscattered bones, more or less conjecturally; but could we have seen\r\nthem march before us in all their majesty, like the Edenic animals\r\nbefore Adam, I feel persuaded that our impressions of this wonderful\r\nage would have far exceeded anything that we can derive either from\r\nwords or illustrations. I insist on this the more that the Miocene\r\nhappens to be very slenderly represented in Britain; and scarcely at\r\nall in north-eastern America; and hence has not impressed the\r\nimagination of the English race so strongly as its importance\r\njustifies.\r\n\r\nThe next succeeding period, that of the Pliocene, continues the\r\nconditions of the last, but with signs of decadence. Many of the old\r\ngigantic pachyderms have disappeared; and in their stead some familiar\r\nmodern genera were introduced. The Pliocene was terminated by the cold\r\nor glacial period, in which a remarkable lowering of temperature\r\noccurred over all the northern hemisphere, accompanied, at least in a\r\nportion of the time, by a very general and great subsidence, which\r\nlaid all the lower parts of our continents under water. This\r\nterminated much of the life of the Pliocene, and replaced it with\r\nboreal and Arctic forms, some of them, like the great hairy Siberian\r\nmammoth and the woolly rhinoceros, fit successors of the gigantic\r\nMiocene fauna. How it happened that such creatures were continued\r\nduring the Post-pliocene cold, we cannot understand till we have the\r\nTertiary vegetation before us. It must suffice now to say, that as the\r\ntemperature was modified, and the land rose, and the Modern period was\r\ninaugurated, these animals passed away, and those of the present time\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable fact connected with this change, is that\r\nstated by Pictet, that all the modern European mammals are direct\r\ndescendants of Post-pliocene species; but that in the Post-pliocene\r\nthey were associated with many other species; and these, often of\r\ngreat dimensions, now extinct. In other words, the time from the\r\nPliocene to the Modern, has been a time of diminution of species,\r\nwhile that from the Eocene to the Miocene was a time of rapid\r\nintroduction of new species. Thus the Tertiary fauna culminated in the\r\nMiocene. Yet, strange though this may appear, Man himself, the latest\r\nand noblest of all, would seem to have been a product of the later\r\nstages of the time of decadence. I propose, however, to return to the\r\nanimals immediately preceding man and his contemporaries, after we\r\nhave noticed the Tertiary flora and the Glacial period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE NEOZOIC AGES (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nPlant-life in the Tertiary approaches very nearly to that of the\r\nModern World, in so far as its leading types are concerned; but in its\r\ndistribution geographically it was wonderfully different from that\r\nwith which we are at present familiar. For example, in the Isle of\r\nSheppey, at the mouth of the themes, are beds of \"London clay,\" fall\r\nof fossil nuts; and these, instead of being hazel nuts and acorns,\r\nbelong to palms allied to species now found in the Philippine Islands\r\nand Bengal, while with them are numerous cone-like fruits belonging to\r\nthe Proteaceæ (banksias, silver-trees, wagenbooms, etc.), a group of\r\ntrees now confined to Australia and South Africa, but which in the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere had already, as stated in a previous paper, made\r\ntheir appearance in the Cretaceous, and were abundant in the Eocene.\r\nThe state of preservation of these fruits shows that they were not\r\ndrifted far; and in some beds in Hampshire, also of Eocene age, the\r\nleaves of similar plants occur along with species of fig, cinnamon,\r\nand other forms equally Australian or Indian. In America, especially\r\nin the west, there are thick and widely-distributed beds of lignite or\r\nimperfect coal of the Eocene period; but the plants found in the\r\nAmerican Eocene are more like those of the European Miocene or the\r\nModern American flora, a fact to which we must revert immediately.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, while the Eocene plants resemble those of Australia, when\r\nwe ascend into the Miocene they resemble those of America, though\r\nstill retaining some of the Australian forms. In the leaf-beds of the\r\nIsle of Mull,--where beds of vegetable mould and leaves were covered\r\nup with the erupted matter of a volcano belonging to a great series of\r\nsuch eruptions which produced the basaltic cliffs of Antrim and of\r\nStaffa,--and at Bovey, in Devonshire, where Miocene plants have\r\naccumulated in many thick beds of lignite, the prevailing plants are\r\nsequoias or red-woods, vines, figs, cinnamons, etc. In the sandstones\r\nat the base of the Alps similar plants and also palms of American\r\ntypes occur. In the Upper Miocene beds of Oeningen in the Rhine\r\nvalley, nearly five hundred species of plants have been found, and\r\ninclude such familiar forms as the maples, plane-trees, cypress, elm,\r\nand sweet-gum, more American, however, then European in their aspect.\r\nIt thus appears that the Miocene flora of Europe resembles that of\r\nAmerica at pre sent, while the Eocene flora of Europe resembles that\r\nof Australia, and the Eocene flora of America, as well as the modern,\r\nresembles the Miocene of Europe. In other words, the changes of the\r\nflora have been more rapid in Europe then in America and probably\r\nslowest of all in Australia. The Eastern Continent has thus taken the\r\nlead in rapidity of change in the Tertiary period, and it has done so\r\nin animals as well as in plants.\r\n\r\nThe following description of the flora of Bovey is given, with slight\r\nalteration, in the words of Dr. Heer, in his memoir on that district.\r\nThe woods that covered the slopes consisted mainly of a huge pine-tree\r\n(sequoia), whose figure resembled in all probability its\r\nhighly-admired cousin, the giant Wellingtonia of California. The leafy\r\ntrees of most frequent occurrence were the cinnamon and an evergreen\r\noak like those now seen in Mexico. The evergreen figs, the custard\r\napples, and allies of the Cape jasmine, were rarer. The trees were\r\nfestooned with vines, beside which the prickly rotang palm twined its\r\nsnake-like form. In the shade of the forest throve numerous ferns, one\r\nspecies of which formed trees of imposing grandeur, and there were\r\nmasses of under-wood belonging to various species of Nyssa, like the\r\ntupelos and sour-gums of North America. This is a true picture, based\r\non actual facts, of the vegetation of England in the Miocene age.\r\n\r\nBut all the other wonders of the Miocene flora are thrown into the\r\nshade by the discoveries of plants of this age which have recently\r\nbeen made in Greenland, a region now bound up in what we poetically\r\ncall eternal ice, but which in the Miocene was a fair and verdant\r\nland, rejoicing in a mild climate and rich vegetation. The beds\r\ncontaining these specimens occur in various places in North Greenland;\r\nand the principal locality, Atane-Kerdluk, is in lat. 70 N. and at an\r\nelevation of more then a thousand feet above the sea. The plants occur\r\nabundantly in sandstone and clay beds, and the manner in which\r\ndelicate leaves and fruits are preserved shows that they have not been\r\nfar water-borne, a conclusion which is confirmed by the occurrence of\r\nbeds of lignite of considerable thickness, and which are evidently\r\npeaty accumulations containing trunks of trees. The collections made\r\nhave enabled Heer to catalogue 137 species, all of them of forms\r\nproper to temperate, or even warm regions, and mostly American in\r\ncharacter. As many as forty-six of the species already referred to as\r\noccurring at Bovey Tracey and Oeningen occur also in the Greenland\r\nbeds. Among the plants are many species of pines, some of them of\r\nlarge size; and the beeches, oaks, planes, poplars, maples, walnuts,\r\nlimes, magnolias, and vines are apparently as well represented as in\r\nthe warm temperate zone of America at the present day. This wonderful\r\nflora was not a merely local phenomenon, for similar plants are found\r\nin Spitzbergen in lat. 78° 56'. It is to be further observed, that\r\nwhile the general characters of these ancient Arctic plants imply a\r\nlarge amount of summer heat and light, the evergreens equally imply a\r\nmild winter. Further, though animal remains are not found with these\r\nplants, it is probable that so rich a supply of vegetable food was not\r\nunutilised, and that we shall some time find that there was an Arctic\r\nfauna corresponding to the Arctic flora. How such a climate could\r\nexist in Greenland and Spitzbergen is still a mystery. It has,\r\nhowever, been suggested that this effect might result from the\r\nconcurrence of such astronomical conditions in connection with the\r\neccentricity of the earth's orbit as would give the greatest amount of\r\nwarmth in the Northern Hemisphere with such distribution of land and\r\nwater as would give the least amount of cold northern land and the\r\nmost favourable arrangement of the warm surface currents of the\r\nocean.[AI]\r\n\r\n[AI] Croll and Lyell.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving these Miocene plants, I must refer to a paragraph which\r\nDr. Heer has thought it necessary to insert in his memoir on the\r\nGreenland flora, and which curiously illustrates the feebleness of\r\nwhat with some men passes for science. He says: \"In conclusion, I beg\r\nto offer a few remarks on the amount of certainty in identification\r\nwhich the determination of fossil plants is able to afford us. We know\r\nthat the flowers, fruits, and seeds are more important as\r\ncharacteristics then the leaves. There are many genera of which the\r\nleaves are variable, and consequently would be likely to lead us\r\nastray if we trusted in them alone. However, many characters of the\r\nform and venation of leaves are well-known to be characteristic of\r\ncertain genera, and can therefore afford us characters of great value\r\nfor their recognition.\" In a similar apologetic style he proceeds\r\nthrough several sentences to plead the cause of his Greenland leaves.\r\nthat he should have to do so is strange, unless indeed the botany\r\nknown to those for whom he writes is no more then that which a\r\nschool-girl learns in her few lessons in dissecting a buttercup or\r\ndaisy. It is easy for scientific triflers to exhibit collections of\r\nplants in which species of different genera and families are so\r\nsimilar in their leaves that a careless observer would mistake one for\r\nthe other, or to get up composite leaves in part of one species and in\r\npart of another, and yet seeming the same, and in this way to\r\nunderrate the labours of painstaking observers like Heer. But it is\r\nnevertheless true that in any of these leaves, not only are there good\r\ncharacters by which they can be recognised, but that a single\r\nbreathing pore, or a single hair, or a few cells, or a bit of\r\nepidermis not larger then a pin's head, should enable any one who\r\nunderstands his business to see as great differences as a merely\r\nsuperficial botanist would see between the flower of a ranunculus and\r\nthat of a strawberry. Heer himself, and the same applies to all other\r\ncompetent students of fossil plants, has almost invariably found his\r\ndeterminations from mere fragments of leaves confirmed when more\r\ncharacteristic parts were afterwards discovered. It is high time, in\r\nthe interests of geology, that botanists should learn that constancy\r\nand correlation of parts are laws in the plant as well as in the\r\nanimal; and this they can learn only by working more diligently with\r\nthe microscope. I would, however, go further then this, and maintain\r\nthat, in regard to some of the most important geological conclusions\r\nto be derived from fossils, even the leaves of plants are vastly more\r\nvaluable then the hard parts of animals. For instance, the bones of\r\nelephants and rhinoceroses found in Greenland would not prove a warm\r\nclimate; because the creatures might have been protected from cold\r\nwith hair like that of the musk-sheep, and they might have had\r\nfacilities for annual migrations like the bisons. The occurrence of\r\nbones of reindeer in France does not prove that its climate was like\r\nthat of Lapland; but only that it was wooded, and that the animals\r\ncould rove at will to the hills and to the coast. But, on the other\r\nhand, the remains of an evergreen oak in Greenland constitute absolute\r\nproof of a warm and equable climate; and the occurrence of leaves of\r\nthe dwarf birch in France constitutes a proof of a cool climate, worth\r\nmore then that which can be derived from the bones of millions of\r\nreindeer and musk-sheep. Still further, in all those greater and more\r\ndifficult questions of geology which relate to the emergence and\r\nsubmergence of land areas, and to the geographical conditions of past\r\ngeological periods, the evidence of plants, especially when rooted in\r\nplace, is of far more value then that of animals, though it has yet\r\nbeen very little used.\r\n\r\nThis digression prepares the way for the question: Was the Miocene\r\nperiod on the whole a better age of the world then that in which we\r\nlive? In some respects it was. Obviously there was in the Northern\r\nHemisphere a vast surface of land under a mild and equable climate,\r\nand clothed with a rich and varied vegetation. Had we lived in the\r\nMiocene, we might have sat under our vine and fig-tree equally in\r\nGreenland and Spitzbergen and in those more southern climes to which\r\nthis privilege is now restricted. We might have enjoyed a great\r\nvariety of rich and nutritive fruits, and, if sufficiently muscular,\r\nand able to cope with the gigantic mammals of the period, we might\r\nhave engaged in either the life of the hunter or that of the\r\nagriculturist under advantages which we do not now possess. On the\r\nwhole, the Miocene presents to us in these respects the perfection of\r\nthe Neozoic time, and its culmination in so far as the nobler forms of\r\nbrute animals and of plants are concerned. Had men existed in those\r\ndays, however, they should have been, in order to suit the conditions\r\nsurrounding them, a race of giants; and they would probably have felt\r\nthe want of many of those more modern species belonging to the flora\r\nand fauna of Europe and Western Asia on which man has so much depended\r\nfor his civilization. Some reasons have been adduced for the belief\r\nthat in the Miocene and Eocene there were intervals of cold climate;\r\nbut the evidence of this may be merely local and exceptional, and does\r\nnot interfere with the broad characteristics of the age as sketched\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThe warm climate and rich vegetation of the Miocene extended far into\r\nthe Pliocene, with characters very similar to those already stated;\r\nbut as the Pliocene age went on, cold and frost settled down upon the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere, and a remarkable change took place in its\r\nvegetable productions. For example, in the somewhat celebrated\r\n\"forest bed\" of Cromer, in Norfolk, which is regarded as Newer\r\nPliocene, we have lost all the foreign and warm-climate plants of the\r\nMiocene, and find the familiar Scotch firs and other plants of the\r\nModern British flora. The animals, however, retain their former types;\r\nfor two species of elephant, a hippopotamus, and a rhinoceros are\r\nfound in connection with these plants. This is another evidence, in\r\naddition to those above referred to, that plants are better\r\nthermometers to indicate geological and climatal change then animals.\r\nThis Pliocene refrigeration appears to have gone on increasing into\r\nthe next or Post-pliocene age, and attained its maximum in the Glacial\r\nperiod, when, as many geologists think, our continents were, even in\r\nthe temperate latitudes, covered with a sheet of ice like that which\r\nnow clothes Greenland. Then occurred a very general subsidence, in\r\nwhich they were submerged under the waters of a cold icy sea, tenanted\r\nby marine animals now belonging to boreal and arctic regions. After\r\nthis last great plunge-bath they rose to constitute the dry land of\r\nman and his contemporaries. Let us close this part of the subject with\r\none striking illustration from Heer's memoir on Bovey Tracey. At this\r\nplace, above the great series of clays and lignites containing the\r\nMiocene plants already described, is a thick covering of clay, gravel,\r\nand stones, evidently of much later date. This also contains some\r\nplants; but instead of the figs, and cinnamons, and evergreen oaks,\r\nthey are the petty dwarf birch of Scandinavia and the Highland hills,\r\nand three willows, one of them the little Arctic and Alpine creeping\r\nwillow. Thus we have in the south of England a transition in the\r\ncourse of the Pliocene period, from a climate much milder then that of\r\nModern England to one almost Arctic in its character.\r\n\r\nOur next topic for consideration is one of the most vexed questions\r\namong geologists, the Glacial period which immediately preceded the\r\nAdvent of Man. In treating of this it will be safest first to sketch the\r\nactual appearances which present themselves, and then to draw such\r\npictures as we can of the conditions which they represent. The most\r\nrecent and superficial covering of the earth's crust is usually composed\r\nof rock material more or less ground up and weathered. This may, with\r\nreference to its geological character and origin, be considered as of\r\nthree kinds. It may be merely the rock weathered and decomposed to a\r\ncertain extent _in situ_; or it may be alluvial matter carried or\r\ndeposited by existing streams or tides, or by the rains; or, lastly, it\r\nmay be material evidencing the operation of causes not now in action.\r\nThis last constitutes what has been called drift or diluvial detritus,\r\nand is that with which we have now to do. Such drift, then, is very\r\nwidely distributed on our continents in the higher latitudes. In the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere it extends from the Arctic regions to about 50° of\r\nnorth latitude in Europe, and as low as 40° in North America; and it\r\noccurs south of similar parallels in the Southern Hemisphere. Farther\r\ntowards the equator then the latitudes indicated, we do not find the\r\nproper drift deposits, but merely weathered rocks or alluvia, or old sea\r\nbottoms raised up. This limitation of the drift, at the very outset\r\ngives it the character of a deposit in some way connected with the Polar\r\ncold. Besides this, the general transport of stones and other material\r\nin the northern regions has been to the south; hence in the Northern\r\nHemisphere this deposit may be called the _Northern_ Drift.\r\n\r\nIf now we take a typical locality of this formation, such, for\r\ninstance, as we may find in Scotland, or Scandinavia, or Canada, we\r\nshall find it to consist of three members, as follows:--\r\n\r\n    3. Superficial Sands or Gravels.\r\n\r\n    2. Stratified Clays.\r\n\r\n    1. Till or Boulder Clay.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement may locally be more complicated, or it may be\r\ndeficient in one of its members. The boulder clay may, for example, be\r\nunderlaid by stratified sand or gravel, or even by peaty deposits; it\r\nmay be intermixed with layers of clay or sand; the stratified clay or\r\nthe boulder clay may be absent, or may be uncovered by any upper\r\nmember. Still we may take the typical series as above stated, and\r\ninquire as to its characters and teaching.\r\n\r\nThe lower member, or boulder clay, is a very remarkable kind of\r\ndeposit, consisting of a paste which may graduate from tough clay to\r\nloose sand, and which holds large angular and rounded stones or\r\nboulders confusedly intermixed; these stones may be either from the\r\nrocks found in the immediate vicinity of their present position, or at\r\ngreat distances. This mass is usually destitute of any lamination or\r\nsubordinate stratification, whence it is often called _Unstratified_\r\nDrift, and is of very variable thickness, often occurring in very\r\nthick beds in valleys, and being comparatively thin or absent on\r\nintervening hills. Further, if we examine the stones contained in the\r\nboulder clay, we shall find that they are often scratched or striated\r\nand grooved; and when we remove the clay from the rock surfaces on\r\nwhich it rests, we find these in like manner striated, grooved and\r\npolished. These phenomena, viz., of polished and striated rocks and\r\nstones, are similar to those produced by those great sliding masses of\r\nice, the glaciers of Alpine regions, which in a small way and in\r\nnarrow and elevated valleys, act on the rocks and stones in this\r\nmanner, though they cannot form deposits precisely analogous to the\r\nboulder clay, owing to the wasting away of much of the finer material\r\nby the torrents, and the heaping of the coarser detritus in ridges\r\nand piles. Further, we have in Greenland a continental mass, with\r\nall its valleys thus filled with slowly-moving ice, and from this\r\nthere drift off immense ice-islands, which continue at least the\r\nmud-and-stone-depositing process, and possibly also the grinding\r\nprocess, over the sea bottom. So far all geologists are agreed; but\r\nhere they diverge into two schools. One of these, then of the Glacier\r\ntheorists, holds that the boulder clay is the product of land-ice; and\r\nthis requires the supposition that at the time when it was deposited\r\nthe whole of our continents north of 40° or 50° was in the condition\r\nof Greenland at present. This is, however, a hypothesis so\r\ninconvenient, not to say improbable, that many hesitate to accept it,\r\nand prefer to believe that in the so-called Glacial period the land\r\nwas submerged, and that icebergs then as now drifted from the north in\r\nobedience to the Arctic currents, and produced the effects observed.\r\nIt would be tedious to go into all the arguments of the advocates of\r\nglaciers and icebergs, and I shall not attempt this, more especially\r\nas the only way to decide the question is to observe carefully the\r\nfacts in every particular locality, and inquire as to the conclusions\r\nfairly deducible. With the view of aiding such a solution, however, I\r\nmay state a few general principles applicable to the appearances\r\nobserved. We may then suppose that boulder clay may be formed in three\r\nways. (1) It may be deposited on land, as what is called the bottom\r\nmoraine of a land glacier. (2) It may be deposited in the sea when\r\nsuch a glacier ends on the coast. (3) It may be deposited by the\r\nmelting or grounding on muddy bottoms of the iceberg masses floated\r\noff from the end of such a glacier. It is altogether likely, from the\r\nobservations recently made in Greenland, that in that country such a\r\ndeposit is being formed in all these ways. In like manner, the\r\nancient boulder clay may have been formed in one or more of these ways\r\nin any given locality where it occurs, though it may be difficult in\r\nmany instances to indicate the precise mode. There are, however,\r\ncertain criteria which may be applied to the determination of its\r\norigin, and I may state a few of these, which are the results of my\r\nown experience. (1) Where the boulder clay contains marine shells, or\r\nrounded stones which if exposed to the air would have been cracked to\r\npieces, decomposed, or oxidized, it must have been formed under water.\r\nWhere the conditions are the reverse of these, it may have been formed\r\non land. (2) When the striations and transport of materials do not\r\nconform to the levels of the country, and take that direction, usually\r\nN.E. and S.W., which the Arctic current would take if the country were\r\nsubmerged, the probability is that it was deposited in the sea. Where,\r\nhowever, the striation and transport take the course of existing\r\nvalleys, more especially in hilly regions, the contrary may be\r\ninferred. (3) Where most of the material, more especially the large\r\nstones, has been carried to great distances from its original site,\r\nespecially over plains or up slopes, it has probably been sea-borne.\r\nWhere it is mostly local, local ice-action may be inferred. Other\r\ncriteria may be stated, but these are sufficient for our present\r\npurpose. Their application in every special case I do not presume to\r\nmake; but I am convinced that when applied to those regions in Eastern\r\nAmerica with which I am familiar, they necessitate the conclusion\r\nthat in the period of extreme refrigeration, the greater part of the\r\nland was under water, and such hills and mountains as remained were\r\nlittle Greenlands, covered with ice and sending down glaciers to the\r\nsea. In hilly and broken regions, therefore, and especially at\r\nconsiderable elevations, we find indications of _glacier_ action; on\r\nthe great plains, on the contrary, the indications are those of\r\n_marine_ glaciation and transport. This last statement, I believe,\r\napplies to the mountains and plains of Europe and Asia as well as of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThis view requires not only the supposition of great refrigeration,\r\nbut of a great subsidence of the land in the temperate latitudes, with\r\nlarge residual islands and hills in the Arctic regions. That such\r\nsubsidence actually took place is proved, not only by the frequent\r\noccurrence of marine shells in the boulder clay itself, but also by\r\nthe occurrence of stratified marine clays filled with shells, often of\r\ndeep-water species, immediately over that deposit. Further, the\r\nshells, and also occasional land plants found in these beds, indicate\r\na cold climate and much cold fresh water pouring into the sea from\r\nmelting ice and snow. In Canada these marine clays have been traced up\r\nto elevations of 600 feet, and in Great Britain deposits of this kind\r\noccur on one of the mountains of Wales at the height of 1300 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea. Nor is it to be supposed that this level\r\nmarks the extreme height of the Post-pliocene waters, for drift\r\nmaterial not explicable by glaciers, and evidences of marine erosion,\r\noccur at still higher levels, and it is natural that on high and\r\nexposed points fewer remains of fossiliferous beds should be left then\r\nin plains and valleys.\r\n\r\nAt the present day the coasts of Britain and other parts of Western\r\nEurope enjoy an exceptionally warm temperature, owing to the warm\r\ncurrents of the Atlantic being thrown on them, and the warm and moist\r\nAtlantic air flowing over them, under the influence of the prevailing\r\nwesterly winds. These advantages are not possessed by the eastern\r\ncoast of North America, nor by some deep channels in the sea, along\r\nwhich the cold northern currents flow under the warmer water. Hence\r\nthese last-mentioned localities are inhabited by boreal shells much\r\nfarther south then such species extend on the coasts and banks of\r\nGreat Britain. In the Glacial period this exceptional advantage was\r\nlost, and while the American seas, as judged by their marine animals,\r\nwere somewhat colder then at present, the British seas were\r\nproportionally much more cooled down. No doubt, however, there were\r\nwarmer and colder areas, determined by depth and prevailing currents,\r\nand as these changed their position in elevation and subsidence of the\r\nland, alternations and even mixtures of the inhabitants of cold and\r\nwarm water resulted, which have often been very puzzling to\r\ngeologists.\r\n\r\nI have taken the series of drift deposits seen in Britain and in\r\nCanada as typical, and the previous discussion has had reference to\r\nthem. But it would be unfair not to inform the reader that this\r\nsuccession of deposits after all belongs to the margins of our\r\ncontinents rather then to their great central areas. This is the case\r\nat least in North America, where in the region of the great lakes the\r\noldest glaciated surfaces are overlaid by thick beds of stratified\r\nclay, without marine fossils, and often without either stones or\r\nboulders, though these sometimes occur, especially toward the north.\r\nThe clay, however, contains drifted fragments of coniferous trees.\r\nAbove this clay are sand and gravel, and the principal deposit of\r\ntravelled stones and boulders rests on these. I cannot affirm that a\r\nsimilar succession occurs on the great inland plains of Europe and\r\nAsia: but I think it probable that to some extent it does. The\r\nexplanation of this inland drift by the advocates of a great\r\ncontinental glacier is as follows: (1) In the Pliocene period the\r\ncontinents were higher then at present, and many deep valleys, since\r\nfilled up, were cut in them. (2) In the Post-pliocene these elevated\r\ncontinents became covered with ice, by the movement of which the\r\nvalleys were deepened and the surfaces striated. (3) This ice-period\r\nwas followed by a depression and submergence, in which the clays were\r\ndeposited, filling up old channels, and much changing the levels of\r\nthe land. Lastly, as the land rose again from this submergence, sand\r\nand gravel were deposited, and boulders scattered over the surface by\r\nfloating ice.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of floating ice as distinguished from a continental\r\nglacier, merely dispense with the latter, and affirm that the\r\nstriation under the clay, as well as that connected with the later\r\nboulders, is the effect of floating bergs. The occurrence of so much\r\ndrift wood in the clay favours their view, as it is more likely that\r\nthere would be islands clothed with trees in the sea, then that these\r\nshould exist immediately after the country had been mantled in ice.\r\nThe want of marine shells is a difficulty in either view, but may be\r\naccounted for by the rapid deposition of the clay and the slow\r\nspreading of marine animals over a submerged continent under\r\nunfavourable conditions of climate.\r\n\r\nIn any case the reader will please observe that theorists must account\r\nfor both the interior and marginal forms of these deposits. Let us\r\ntabulate the facts and the modes of accounting for them.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------+------------------------------------\r\n          FACTS OBSERVED.             |       THEORETICAL VIEWS.\r\n  -------------------+----------------+------------------------------------\r\n   Inland Plains.    | Marginal Areas.|Glacial Theories.| Floating Ice\r\n                     |                |                 |  Theories.\r\n  ===================+================+====================================\r\n    Terraces.        | Terraces and   |   Emergence of Modern Land.[AJ]\r\n                     | Raised Beaches.|\r\n  -------------------+----------------+------------------------------------\r\n  Travelled Boulders |Sand and Gravel,|\r\n  and Glaciated      |with Sea Shells |\r\n  Stones and Rocks   |and Boulders.   |  Shallow Sea and Floating Ice.\r\n  Stratified Sand    |                |\r\n  and Gravel.        |                |\r\n  -------------------+----------------+------------------------------------\r\n  Stratified Clay    |Stratified Clay |  Deep Sea and Floating Ice.\r\n  with Drift Wood,   |with Sea Shells.+----------------+-------------------\r\n  and a few Stones.  |Boulder Clay    |Submergence of  |Much floating Ice\r\n  and Boulders.      |with or without |the land.

Both theories admit a great Post-pliocene subsidence. The\r\nabettors of glaciers can urge the elevation of the surface, the\r\nsupposed powers of glaciers as eroding agents, and the transport of\r\nboulders. Those whose theoretical views lean to floating ice, believe\r\nthat they can equally account for these phenomena, and can urge in\r\nsupport of their theory the occurrence of drift wood in the inland\r\nclay and boulder clay, and of sea-shells in the marginal clay and\r\nboulder clay, and the atmospheric decomposition of rock in the\r\nPliocene period, as a source of the material of the clays, while to\r\nsimilar causes they can attribute the erosion of the deep valleys\r\npiled with the Post-pliocene deposits. They can also maintain that the\r\ngeneral direction of striation and drift implies the action of sea\r\ncurrents, while they appeal to local glaciers to account for special\r\ncases of glaciated rocks at the higher levels.\r\n\r\nHow long our continental plateaus remained under the icy seas of the\r\nGlacial period we do not know. Relatively to human chronology, it was\r\nno doubt a long time; but short in comparison with those older\r\nsubsidences in which the great Palæozoic limestones were produced. At\r\nlength, however, the change came. Slowly and gradually, or by\r\nintermittent lifts, the land rose: and as it did so, shallow-water\r\nsands and gravels were deposited on the surface of the deep-sea clays,\r\nand the sides of the hills were cut into inland cliffs and terraces,\r\nmarking the stages of recession of the waters. At length, when the\r\nprocess was complete, our present continents stood forth in their\r\nexisting proportions ready for the occupancy of man.\r\n\r\nThe picture which these changes present to the imagination is one of\r\nthe most extraordinary in all geological history. We have been\r\nfamiliar with the idea of worlds drowned in water, and the primeval\r\nincandescent earth shows us the possibility of our globe being melted\r\nwith fervent heat; but here we have a world apparently frozen out\r\ndestroyed by cold, or doubly destroyed by ice and water. Let us\r\nendeavour to realise this revolution, as it may have occurred in any\r\nof the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, thickly peopled\r\nwith the magnificent animals that had come down from the grand old\r\nMiocene time. Gradually the warm and equable temperature gives place\r\nto cold winters and chilly wet summers. The more tender animals die\r\nout, and the less hardy plants begin to be winter-killed, or to fail\r\nto perfect their fruits. As the forests are thus decimated, other and\r\nhardier species replace those which disappear. The animals which have\r\nhad to confine themselves to sheltered spots, or which have perished\r\nthrough cold or want of food, are replaced by others migrating from\r\nthe mountains, or from colder regions. Some, perhaps, in the course\r\nof generations, become dwarfed in stature, and covered with more\r\nshaggy fur. Permanent snow at length appears upon the hill-tops, and\r\nglaciers plough their way downward, devastating the forests,\r\nencroaching on the fertile plains, and at length reaching the heads of\r\nthe bays and fiords. While snow and ice are thus encroaching from\r\nabove, the land is subsiding, and the sea is advancing upon it, while\r\ngreat icebergs drifting on the coasts still further reduce the\r\ntemperature. Torrents and avalanches from the hills carry mud and\r\ngravel over the plains. Peat bogs accumulate in the hollows. Glaciers\r\nheap up confused masses of moraine, and the advancing sea piles up\r\nstones and shingle to be imbedded in mud on its further advance, while\r\nboreal marine animals invade the now submerged plains. At length the\r\nice and water meet everywhere, or leave only a few green strips where\r\nhardy Arctic plants still survive, and a few well-clad animals manage\r\nto protract their existence. Perhaps even these are overwhelmed, and\r\nthe curtain of the Glacial winter falls over the fair scenery of the\r\nPliocene. In every locality thus invaded by an apparently perpetual\r\nwinter, some species of laud animals must have perished. Others may\r\nhave migrated to more genial climes, others under depauperated and\r\nhardy varietal forms may have continued successfully to struggle for\r\nexistence. The general result must have been greatly to diminish the\r\nnobler forms of life, and to encourage only those fitted for the most\r\nrigorous climates and least productive soils.\r\n\r\nCould we have visited the world in this dreary period, and have\r\nwitnessed the decadence and death of that brilliant and magnificent\r\nflora and fauna which we have traced upward from the Eocene, we might\r\nwell have despaired of the earth's destinies, and have fancied it the\r\nsport of some malignant demon; or have supposed that in the contest\r\nbetween the powers of destruction and those of renovation the former\r\nhad finally gained the victory. We must observe, however, that the\r\nsuffering in such a process is less then we might suppose. So long as\r\nanimals could exist, they would continue to enjoy life. The conditions\r\nunfavourable to them would be equally or more so to their natural\r\nenemies. Only the last survivors would meet with what might be\r\nregarded as a tragical end. As one description of animal became\r\nextinct, another was prepared to occupy its room. If elephants and\r\nrhinoceroses perished from the land, countless herds of walruses and\r\nseals took their places. If gay insects died and disappeared,\r\nshell-fishes and sea-stars were their successors.\r\n\r\nThus in nature there is life even in death, and constant enjoyment\r\neven when old systems are passing away. But could we have survived the\r\nGlacial period, we should have seen a reason for its apparently\r\nwholesale destruction. Out of that chaos came at length an Eden; and\r\njust as the Permian prepared the way for the Mesozoic, so the glaciers\r\nand icebergs of the Post-pliocene were the ploughshare of God\r\npreparing the earth for the time when, with a flora and fauna more\r\nbeautiful and useful, if less magnificent then that of the Tertiary,\r\nit became as the garden of the Lord, fitted for the reception of His\r\nimage and likeness, immortal and intelligent Man. We need not,\r\nhowever, with one modern school of philosophy, regard man himself as\r\nbut a descendant of Miocene apes, scourged into reason and humanity by\r\nthe struggle for existence in the Glacial period. We may be content to\r\nconsider him as a son of God, and to study in the succeeding chapters\r\nthat renewal of the Post-pliocene world which preceded and heralded\r\nhis advent.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, our illustration,[AK] borrowed in part from the\r\nmagnificent representation of the Post-pliocene fauna of England, by\r\nthe great restorer of extinct animals, Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins, may\r\nserve to give some idea of the grand and massive forms of animal life\r\nwhich, even in the higher latitudes, survived the Post-pliocene cold,\r\nand only decayed and disappeared under that amelioration of physical\r\nconditions which marks the introduction of the human period.\r\n\r\n[AK] Page 301.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nCLOSE OF THE POST-PLIOCENE, AND ADVENT OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In_ closing these sketches it may seem unsatisfactory not to link the\r\ngeological ages with the modern period in which we live; yet, perhaps,\r\nnothing is more complicated or encompassed with greater difficulties\r\nor uncertainties. The geologist, emerging from the study of the older\r\nmonuments of the earth's history, and working with the methods of\r\nphysical science, here meets face to face the archæologist and\r\nhistorian, who have been tracing back in the opposite direction, and\r\nwith very different appliances, the stream of human history and\r\ntradition. In such circumstances conflicts may occur, or at least the\r\ntwo paths of inquiry may refuse to connect themselves without\r\nconcessions unpleasant to the pursuers of one or both. Further, it is\r\njust at this meeting-place that the dim candle of traditional lore is\r\nalmost burnt out in the hand of the antiquary, and that the geologist\r\nfinds his monumental evidence becoming more scanty and less distinct.\r\nWe cannot hope as yet to dispel all the shadows that haunt this\r\nobscure domain, but can at least point out some of the paths which\r\ntraverse it. In attempting this, we may first classify the time\r\ninvolved as follows: (1) The earlier Post-pliocene period of geology\r\nmay be called the _Glacial_ era. It is that of a cold climate,\r\naccompanied by glaciation and boulder deposits. (2) The later\r\n_Post-pliocene_ may be called the Post-glacial era. It is that of\r\nre-elevation of the continents and restoration of a mild temperature.\r\nIt connects itself with the pre-historic period of the archæologist,\r\ninasmuch as remains of man and his works are apparently included in\r\nthe same deposits which hold the bones of Post-glacial animals. (3)\r\nThe _Modern_ era is that of secular human history.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated with certainty that the Pliocene period of geology\r\naffords no trace of human remains or implements; and the same may I\r\nthink be affirmed of the period of glaciation and subsidence which\r\nconstitutes the earlier Post-pliocene. With the rise of the land out\r\nof the Glacial sea indications of man are believed to appear, along\r\nwith remains of several mammalian species now his contemporaries.\r\nArchæology and geology thus meet somewhere in the pre-historic period\r\nof the former, and in the Post-glacial of the latter. Wherever,\r\ntherefore, human history extends farthest back, and geological\r\nformations of the most modern periods exist and have been explored, we\r\nmay expect best to define their junctions. Unfortunately it happens\r\nthat our information on these points is still very incomplete and\r\nlocally limited. In many extensive regions, like America and\r\nAustralia, while the geological record is somewhat complete, the\r\nhistoric record extends back at most a few centuries, and the\r\npre-historic monuments are of uncertain date. In other countries, as\r\nin Western Asia and Egypt, where the historic record extends very far\r\nback, the geology is less perfectly known. At the present moment,\r\ntherefore, the main battle-field of these controversies is in Western\r\nEurope, where, though history scarce extends farther back then the\r\ntime of the Roman Republic, the geologic record is very complete, and\r\nhas been explored with some thoroughness. It is obvious, however, that\r\nwe thus have to face the question at a point where the pre-historic\r\ngap is necessarily very wide.\r\n\r\nTaking England as an example, all before the Roman invasion is\r\npre-historic, and with regard to this pre-historic period the evidence\r\nthat we can obtain is chiefly of a geological character. The\r\npre-historic men are essentially fossils. We know of them merely what\r\ncan be learned from their bones and implements embedded in the soil or\r\nin the earth of the caverns in which some of them sheltered\r\nthemselves. For the origin and date of these deposits the antiquary\r\nmust go to the geologist, and he imitates the geologist in arranging\r\nhis human fossils under such names as the \"Paleolithic,\" or period of\r\nrude stone implements; the \"Neolithic\" or period of polished stone\r\nimplements; the Bronze Period, and the Iron Period; though inasmuch as\r\nhigher and lower states of the arts seem always to have coexisted, and\r\nthe time involved is comparatively short, these periods are of far\r\nless value then those of geology. In Britain the age of iron is in the\r\nmain historic. That of bronze goes back to the times of early\r\nPhoenician trade with the south of England. That of stone, while\r\nlocally extending far into the succeeding ages, reaches back into an\r\nunknown antiquity, and is, as we shall see in the sequel, probably\r\ndivided into two by a great physical change, though not in the abrupt\r\nand arbitrary way sometimes assumed by those who base their\r\nclassification solely on the rude or polished character of stone\r\nimplements. We must not forget, however, that in Western Asia the ages\r\nof bronze and iron may have begun two thousand years at least earlier\r\nthen in Britain, and that in some parts of America the Palaeolithic\r\nage of chipped stone implements still continues. We must also bear in\r\nmind that when the archæologist appeals to the geologist for aid, he\r\nthereby leaves that kind of investigation in which dates are settled\r\nby years, for that in which they are marked merely by successive\r\nphysical and organic changes.\r\n\r\nTurning, then, to our familiar geological methods, and confining\r\nourselves mainly to the Northern Hemisphere and to Western Europe, two\r\npictures present themselves to us: (!) The physical changes preceding\r\nthe advent of man; (2) The decadence of the land animals of the\r\nPost-pliocene age, and the appearance of those of the modern.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter I had to introduce the reader to a great and\r\nterrible revolution, whereby the old Pliocene continents, with all\r\ntheir wealth of animals and plants, became sealed up in a mantle of\r\nGreenland ice, or, slowly sinking beneath the level of the sea, were\r\ntransformed into an ocean-bottom over which icebergs bore their\r\nfreight of clay and boulders. We also saw that as the Post-pliocene\r\nage advanced, the latter condition prevailed, until the waters stood\r\nmore then a thousand feet deep over the plains of Europe. In this\r\ngreat glacial submergence, which closed the earlier Post-pliocene\r\nperiod, and over vast areas of the Northern Hemisphere, terminated the\r\nexistence of many of the noblest forms of life, it is believed that\r\nman had no share. We have, at least as yet, no record of his presence.\r\n\r\nOut of these waters the land again rose slowly and intermittently, so\r\nthat the receding waves worked even out of hard rocks ranges of coast\r\ncliff which the further elevation converted into inland terraces, and\r\nthat the clay and stones deposited by the Glacial waters were in many\r\nplaces worked over and rearranged by the tides and waves of the\r\nshallowing sea before they were permanently raised up to undergo the\r\naction of the rains and streams, while long banks of sand and gravel\r\nwere stretched across plains and the mouths of valleys, constituting\r\n\"kames,\" or \"eskers,\" only to be distinguished from moraines of\r\nglaciers by the stratified arrangement of their materials.\r\n\r\nFurther, as the land rose, its surface was greatly and rapidly\r\nmodified by rains and streams. There is the amplest evidence, both in\r\nEurope and America, that at this time the erosion by these means was\r\nenormous in comparison with anything we now experience. The rainfall\r\nmust have been excessive, the volume of water in the streams very\r\ngreat; and the facilities for cutting channels in the old Pliocene\r\nvalleys, filled to the brim with mud and boulder-clay, were\r\nunprecedented. While the area of the land was still limited, much of\r\nit would be high and broken, and it would have all the dampness of an\r\ninsular climate. As it rose in height, plains which had, while under\r\nthe sea, been loaded with the _débris_ swept from the land, would be\r\nraised up to experience river erosion. It was the spring-time of the\r\nGlacial era, a spring eminent for its melting snows, its rains, and\r\nits river floods.[AL] To an observer living at this time it would have\r\nseemed as if the slow process of moulding the continents was being\r\npushed forward with unexampled rapidity. The valleys were ploughed out\r\nand cleansed, the plains levelled and overspread with beds of\r\nalluvium, giving new features of beauty and utility to the land, and\r\npreparing the way for the life of the Modern period, as if to make up\r\nfor the time which had been lost in the dreary Glacial age. It will\r\nreadily be understood how puzzling these deposits have been to\r\ngeologists, especially to those who fail to present to their minds the\r\ntrue conditions of the period; and how difficult it is to separate the\r\nriver alluvia of this age from the deposits in the seas and estuaries,\r\nand these again from the older Glacial beds. Further, in not a few\r\ninstances the animals of a cold climate must have lived in close\r\nproximity to those which belonged to ameliorated conditions, and the\r\nfossils of the older Post-pliocene must often, in the process of\r\nsorting by water, have been mixed with those of the newer.\r\n\r\n[AL] Mr. Tylor has well designated this period as the Pluvial age.\r\n_Journal of the Geological Society_, 1870.\r\n\r\nMany years ago the brilliant and penetrating intellect of Edward\r\nForbes was directed to the question of the maximum extent of the later\r\nPost-pliocene or Post-glacial land; and his investigations into the\r\ndistribution of the European flora, in connection with the phenomena\r\nof submerged terrestrial surfaces, led to the belief that the land had\r\nrisen until it was both higher and more extensive then at present. At\r\nthe time of greatest elevation, England was joined to the continent of\r\nEurope by a level plain, and a similar plain connected Ireland with\r\nits sister islands. Over these plains the plants constituting the\r\n\"Germanic\" flora spread themselves into the area of the British\r\nIslands, and herds of mammoth, rhinoceros, and Irish elk wandered and\r\nextended their range from east to west. The deductions of Forbes have\r\nbeen confirmed and extended by others; and it can scarcely be doubted\r\nthat in the Post-glacial era, the land regained fully the extent which\r\nit had possessed in the time of the Pliocene. In these circumstances\r\nthe loftier hills might still reach the limits of perpetual snow, but\r\ntheir glaciers would no longer descend to the sea. What are now the\r\nbeds of shallow seas would be vast wooded plains, drained by\r\nmagnificent rivers, whose main courses are now submerged, and only\r\ntheir branches remain as separate and distinct streams, The cold but\r\nequable climate of the Post-pliocene would now be exchanged for warm\r\nsummers, alternating with sharp winters, whose severity would be\r\nmitigated by the dense forest covering, which would also contribute to\r\nthe due supply of moisture, preventing the surface from being burnt\r\ninto arid plains.\r\n\r\nIt seems not improbable that it was when the continents had attained\r\nto their greatest extension and when animal and vegetable life had\r\nagain over-spread the new land to its utmost limits, that man was\r\nintroduced on the eastern continent, and with him several mammalian\r\nspecies, not known in the Pliocene period, and some of which, as the\r\nsheep, the goat, the ox, and the dog, have ever since been his\r\ncompanions and humble allies. These, at least in the west of Europe,\r\nwere the \"Palaeolithic\" men, the makers of the oldest flint\r\nimplements; and armed with these, they had to assert the mastery of\r\nman over broader lands then we now possess, and over many species of\r\ngreat animals now extinct. In thus writing, I assume the accuracy of\r\nthe inferences from the occurrence of worked stones with the bones of\r\npost-glacial animals, which must have lived during the condition of\r\nour continents above referred to. If these inferences are well\r\nfounded, not only did man exist at this time, but man not even\r\nvarietally distinct from modern European races. But if man really\r\nappeared in Europe in the Post-glacial era, he was destined to be\r\nexposed to one great natural vicissitude before his permanent\r\nestablishment in the world. The land had reached its maximum\r\nelevation, but its foundations, \"standing in the water and out of the\r\nwater,\" were not yet securely settled, and it had to take one more\r\nplunge-bath before attaining its modern fixity. This seems to have\r\nbeen a comparatively rapid subsidence and re-elevation, leaving but\r\nslender traces of its occurrence, but changing to some extent the\r\nlevels of the continents, and failing to restore them fully to their\r\nformer elevation, so that large areas of the lower grounds still\r\nremained under the sea. If, as the greater number of geologists now\r\nbelieve, man was then on the earth, it is not impossible that this\r\nconstituted the deluge recorded in that remarkable \"log book\" of\r\nNoah preserved to us in Genesis, and of which the memory remains\r\nin the traditions of most ancient nations. This is at least the\r\ngeological deluge which separates the Post-glacial period from the\r\nModern, and the earlier from the later pre-historic period of the\r\narchæologists.[AM]\r\n\r\n[AM] I have long thought that the narrative in Gen. vii. and viii. can\r\nbe understood only on the supposition that it is a contemporary\r\njournal or log of an eye-witness incorporated by the author of Genesis\r\nin his work. The dates of the rising and fall of the water, the note\r\nof soundings over the hill-tops when the maximum was attained, and\r\nmany other details, as well as the whole tone of the narrative, seem\r\nto require this supposition, which also removes all the difficulties\r\nof interpretation which have been so much felt.\r\n\r\nVery important questions of time are involved in this idea of\r\nPost-glacial man, and much will depend, in the solution of these, on\r\nthe views which we adopt as to the rate of subsidence and elevation of\r\nthe land. If, with the majority of British geologists, we hold that it\r\nis to be measured by those slow movements now in progress, the time\r\nrequired will be long. If, with most Continental and some American\r\ngeologists, we believe in paroxysmal movements of elevation and\r\ndepression, it may be much reduced. We have seen in the progress of\r\nour inquiries that the movements of the continents seem to have\r\noccurred with accelerated rapidity in the more modern periods. We have\r\nalso seen that these movements might depend on the slow contraction of\r\nthe earth's crust due to cooling, but that the effects of this\r\ncontraction might manifest themselves only at intervals. We have\r\nfurther seen that the gradual retardation of the rotation of the earth\r\nfurnishes a cause capable of producing elevation and subsidence of the\r\nland, and that this also might be manifested at longer or shorter\r\nintervals, according to the strength and resisting power of the crust.\r\nUnder the influence of this retardation, so long as the crust of the\r\nearth did not give way, the waters would be driven toward the poles,\r\nand the northern land would be submerged; but so soon as the tension\r\nbecame so great as to rupture the solid shell, the equatorial regions\r\nwould collapse, and the northern land would again be raised. The\r\nsubsidence would be gradual, the elevation paroxysmal, and perhaps\r\nintermittent. Let us suppose that this was what occurred in the\r\nGlacial period, and that the land had attained to its maximum\r\nelevation. This might not prove to be permanent; the new balance of\r\nthe crust might be liable to local or general disturbance in a minor\r\ndegree, leading to subsidence and partial re-elevation, following the\r\ngreat Post-glacial elevation. There is, therefore, nothing\r\nunreasonable in that view which makes the subsidence and re-elevation\r\nat the close of the Post-glacial period somewhat abrupt, at least when\r\ncompared with some more ancient movements.\r\n\r\nBut what is the evidence of the deposits formed at this period? Here\r\nwe meet with results most diverse and contradictory, but I think there\r\ncan be little doubt that on this kind of evidence the time required\r\nfor the Post-glacial period has been greatly exaggerated, especially\r\nby those geologists who refuse to receive such views as to subsidence\r\nand elevation as those above stated. The calculations of long time\r\nbased on the gravels of the Somme, on the cone of the Tinière, on the\r\npeat bogs of France and Denmark, on certain cavern deposits, have all\r\nbeen shown to be more or less at fault; and possibly none of these\r\nreach further back then the six or seven thousand years which,\r\naccording to Dr. Andrews, have elapsed since the close of the\r\nboulder-clay deposits in America.[AN] I am aware that such a statement\r\nwill be regarded with surprise by many in England, where even the\r\npopular literature has been penetrated with the idea of a duration of\r\nthe human period immensely long in comparison with what used to be the\r\npopular belief; but I feel convinced that the scientific pendulum must\r\nswing backward in this direction nearer to its old position. Let us\r\nlook at a few of the facts. Much use has been made of the \"cone\" or\r\ndelta of the Tinière on the eastern side of the Lake of Geneva, as an\r\nillustration of the duration of the Modern period. This little stream\r\nhas deposited at its mouth a mass of _débris_ carried down from the\r\nhills. This being cut through by a railway, is found to contain Roman\r\nremains to a depth of four feet, bronze implements to a depth of ten\r\nfeet, stone implements at a depth of nineteen feet. The deposit ceased\r\nabout three hundred years ago, and calculating 1300 to 1500 years for\r\nthe Roman period, we should have 7000 to 10,000 years as the age of\r\nthe cone. But before the formation of the present cone, another had\r\nbeen formed twelve times as large. Thus for the two cones together, a\r\nduration of more then 90,000 years is claimed. It appears, however,\r\nthat this calculation has been made irrespective of two essential\r\nelements in the question. No allowance has been made for the fact that\r\nthe inner layers of a cone are necessarily smaller then the outer;\r\nnor for the further fact that the older cone belongs to a distinct\r\ntime (the pluvial age already referred to), when the rainfall was much\r\nlarger, and the transporting power of the torrent great in proportion.\r\nMaking allowance for these conditions, the age of the newer cone, that\r\nholding human remains, falls between 4000 and 5000 years. The peat bed\r\nof Abbeville, in the north of France, has grown at the rate of one and\r\na half to two inches in a century. Being twenty-six feet in thickness,\r\nthe time occupied in its growth must have amounted to 20,000 years;\r\nand yet it is probably newer then some of the gravels on the same\r\nriver containing flint implements. But the composition of the\r\nAbbeville peat shows that it's a forest peat, and the erect stems\r\npreserved in it prove that in the first instance it must have grown at\r\nthe rate of about three feet in a century, and after the destruction\r\nof the forest its rate of increase down to the present time diminished\r\nrapidly almost to nothing. Its age is thus reduced to perhaps less\r\nthen 4000 years. In 1865 I had an opportunity to examine the now\r\ncelebrated gravels of St. Acheul, on the Somme, by some supposed to go\r\nback to a very ancient period. With the papers of Prestwich and other\r\nable observers in my hand, I could conclude merely that the\r\nundisturbed gravels were older then the Roman period, but how much\r\nolder only detailed topographical surveys could prove; and that taking\r\ninto account the probabilities of a different level of the land, a\r\nwooded condition of the country, a greater rainfall, and a glacial\r\nfilling of the Somme valley with clay and stones subsequently cut out\r\nby running water the gravels could scarcely be older then the\r\nAbbeville peat. To have published such views in England would have\r\nbeen simply to have delivered myself into the hands of the\r\nPhilistines. I therefore contented myself with recording my opinion in\r\nCanada. Tylor[AO] and Andrews[AP] have, however, I think, subsequently\r\nshown that my impressions were correct. In like manner, I fail to\r\nperceive, and I think all American geologists acquainted with the\r\npre-historic monuments of the western continent must agree with me,\r\nany evidence of great antiquity in the caves of Belgium and England,\r\nthe kitchen-middens of Denmark, the rock-shelters of France, the lake\r\nhabitations of Switzerland. At the same time, I would disclaim all\r\nattempt to resolve their dates into precise terms of years. I may\r\nmerely add, that the elaborate and careful observations of Dr. Andrews\r\non the raised beaches of Lake Michigan, observations of a much more\r\nprecise character then any which, in so far as I know, have been made\r\nof such deposits in Europe, enable him to calculate the time which has\r\nelapsed since North America rose out of the waters of the Glacial\r\nperiod as between 5500 and 7500 years. This fixes at least the\r\npossible duration of the human period in North America, though I\r\nbelieve there are other lines of evidence which, would reduce the\r\nresidence of man in America to a much shorter time. Longer periods\r\nhave, it is true, been deduced from the delta of the Mississippi and\r\nthe gorge of Niagara; but the deposits of the former have been found\r\nby Hilgard to be in great part marine, and the excavation of the\r\nlatter began at a period probably long Anterior to the advent of man.\r\n\r\n[AN] \"Transactions, Chicago Academy,\" 1871.\r\n\r\n[AO] \"Journal of Geological Society,\" vol. xxv.\r\n\r\n[AP] \"Silliman's Journal,\" 1868.\r\n\r\nBut another question remains. From the similarities existing in the\r\nanimals and plants of regions in the southern hemisphere now widely\r\nseparated by the ocean, it has been inferred that Post-pliocene land\r\nof great extent existed there; and that on this land men may have\r\nlived before the continents of the northern hemisphere were ready for\r\nthem. It has even been supposed that, inasmuch as the flora and fauna\r\nof Australia have an aspect like that of the Eocene Tertiary, and very\r\nlow forms of man exist in that part of the world, these low races are\r\nthe oldest of all, and may date from Tertiary times. Positive evidence\r\nof this, however, there is none. These races have no monuments; nor,\r\nso far as known, have they left their remains in Post-pliocene\r\ndeposits. It depends on the assumptions that the ruder races of men\r\nare the oldest; and that man has no greater migratory powers then\r\nother animals. The first is probably false, as being contrary to\r\nhistory; and also to the testimony of palaeontology with reference to\r\nthe laws of creation. The second is certainly false; for we know that\r\nman has managed to associate himself with every existing fauna and\r\nflora, even in modern times; and that the most modern races have\r\npitched their tents amid tree-ferns and Proteaceæ, and have hunted\r\nkangaroos and emus. Further, when we consider that the productions of\r\nthe southern hemisphere are not only more antique then those of the\r\nnorthern, but, on the whole, less suited for the comfortable\r\nsubsistence of man and the animals most useful to him; and that the\r\nPost-pliocene animals of the southern hemisphere were of similar types\r\nwith their modern successors, we are the less inclined to believe that\r\nthese regions would be selected as the cradle of the human race.\r\n\r\nCONDENSED TABULAR VIEW OF THE AGES AND PERIODS OF THE NEOZOIC.\r\n\r\n  Key to Symbols\r\n\r\n  ### Recent species of Aquatic Invertebrates.

(_Continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning from these difficult questions of time, we may now look at the\r\nassemblage of land-animals presented by the Post-glacial period. Here,\r\nfor the first time in the great series of continental elevations and\r\ndepressions, we find the newly-emerging land peopled with familiar\r\nforms. Nearly all the modern European animals have left their bones in\r\nthe clays, gravels, and cavern deposits which belong to this period;\r\nbut with them are others either not now found within the limits of\r\ntemperate Europe, or altogether extinct. Thus the remarkable fact\r\ncomes out, that the uprising land was peopled at first with a more\r\nabundant fauna then that which it now sustains, and that many species,\r\nand among these some of the largest and most powerful, have been\r\nweeded out, either before the advent of man or in the changes which\r\nimmediately succeeded that event. That in the Post-glacial period so\r\nmany noble animal species should have been overthrown in the struggle\r\nfor existence, without leaving any successors, at least in Europe, is\r\none of the most remarkable phenomena in the history of life on our\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nAccording to. Pictet,[AQ] the Post-glacial beds of Europe afford\r\nninety-eight species of mammals, of which fifty-seven still live\r\nthere, the remainder being either locally or wholly extinct. According\r\nto Mr. Boyd Dawkins,[AR] in Great Britain about twelve Pliocene\r\nspecies survived the Glacial period, and reappeared in the British\r\nIslands in the Post-glacial. To these were added forty-one species\r\nmaking in all fifty-three, whose remains are found in the gravels and\r\ncaves of the latter period. Of these, in the Modern period\r\ntwenty-eight, or rather more then one-half, survive, fourteen are\r\nwholly extinct, and eleven are locally extinct.\r\n\r\n[AQ] Palæontologie.\r\n\r\n[AR] \"Journal of Geological Society,\" and Palæontographical Society's\r\npublications.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITAIN IN THE POST-PLIOCENE AGE. Musk-sheep,\r\nHippopotamus, Machairodus, Mammoth, Wooly Rhinoceros, Long-fronted Ox,\r\nand Irish stag. The animals are taken from Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins's\r\npicture, \"Struggles of Life among British Animals of the Antediluvian\r\nTimes.\" London: 1853. The landscape is that of the later part of the\r\ncold Post-pliocene period.]\r\n\r\nAmong the extinct beasts, were some of very remarkable character.\r\nThere were two or more species of elephant, which seem in this age to\r\nhave overspread, in vast herds, all the plains of Northern Europe and\r\nAsia; and one of which we know, from the perfect specimen found\r\nembedded in the frozen soil of Siberia, lived till a very modern\r\nperiod; and was clothed with long hair and fur, fitting it for a cold\r\nclimate. There were also three or four species of rhinoceros, one of\r\nwhich at least (the _R. Tichorhinus_) was clad with wool like the great\r\nSiberian mammoth. With these was a huge hippopotamus (_H. major_), whose\r\nhead-quarters would, however, seem to have been farther south then\r\nEngland, or which perhaps inhabited chiefly the swamps along the large\r\nrivers running through areas now under the sea. The occurrence of such\r\nan animal shows an abundant vegetation, and a climate so mild, that\r\nthe rivers were not covered with heavy ice in winter; for the\r\nsupposition that this old hippopotamus was a migratory animal seems\r\nvery unlikely. Another animal of this time, was the magnificent deer,\r\nknown as the Irish elk; and which perhaps had its principal abode on\r\nthe great plain which is now the Irish Sea. The terrible machairodus,\r\nor cymetar-toothed tiger, was continued from the Pliocene; and in\r\naddition to species of bear still living, there was a species of\r\ngigantic size, probably now extinct, the cave bear. Evidences are\r\naccumulating, to show that all or nearly all these survived until the\r\nhuman period.\r\n\r\nIf we turn now to those animals which are only locally extinct, we\r\nmeet with some strange, and at first sight puzzling anomalies. Some of\r\nthese are creatures now limited to climates much colder then that of\r\nBritain. Others now belong to warmer climates. Conspicuous among the\r\nformer are the musk-sheep, the elk, the reindeer, the glutton, and the\r\nlemming. Among the latter, we see the panther, the lion, and the Cape\r\nhyena. That animals now so widely separated as the musk-sheep of\r\nArctic America and the hyena of South Africa, could ever have\r\ninhabited the same forests, seems a dream of the wildest fancy. Yet it\r\nis not difficult to find a probable solution of the mystery. In North\r\nAmerica, at the present day, the puma, or American lion, comes up to\r\nthe same latitudes with the caribou, or reindeer, and moose; and in\r\nAsia, the tiger extends its migrations into the abodes of boreal\r\nanimals in the plains of Siberia. Even in Europe, within the historic\r\nperiod, the reindeer inhabited the forests of Germany; and the lion\r\nextended its range nearly as far northward. The explanation lies in\r\nthe co-existence of a densely wooded country with a temperate climate;\r\nthe forests affording to southern animals shelter from the cold or\r\nwinter; and equally to the northern animals protection from the heat\r\nof summer. Hence our wonder at this association of animals of diverse\r\nhabitudes as to climate, is merely a prejudice arising from the\r\npresent exceptional condition of Europe. Still it is possible that\r\nchanges unfavourable to some of these animals, were in progress before\r\nthe arrival of man, with his clearings and forest fires and other\r\ndisturbing agencies. Even in America, the megalonyx, or gigantic\r\nsloth, the mammoth, the mastodon, the fossil horse, and many other\r\ncreatures, disappeared before the Modern period; and on both\r\ncontinents the great Post-glacial subsidence or deluge may have swept\r\naway some of the species. Such a supposition seems necessary to\r\naccount for the phenomena of the gravel and cave deposits of England,\r\nand Cope has recently suggested it in explanation of similar\r\nstorehouses of fossil animals in America.[AS]\r\n\r\n[AS] Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, April 1871.\r\n\r\nAmong the many pictures which this fertile subject calls up, perhaps\r\nnone is more curious then that presented by the Post-glacial cavern\r\ndeposits. We may close our survey of this period with the exploration\r\nof one of these strange repositories; and may select Kent's Hole at\r\nTorquay, so carefully excavated and illumined with the magnesium light\r\nof scientific inquiry by Mr. Pengelly and a committee of the British\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nThe somewhat extensive and ramifying cavern of Kent's Hole is an\r\nirregular excavation, evidently due partly to fissures in limestone\r\nrock, and partly to the erosive action of water enlarging such\r\nfissures into chambers and galleries. At what time it was originally\r\ncut we do not know, but it must have existed as a cavern at the close\r\nof the Pliocene or beginning of the Post-pliocene period, since which\r\ntime it has been receiving a series of deposits which have quite\r\nfilled up some of its smaller branches.\r\n\r\nFirst and lowest, according to Mr. Pengelly, is a \"breccia\" or mass of\r\nbroken and rounded stones, with hardened red clay filling the\r\ninterstices. Most of the stones are of the rock which forms the roof\r\nand walls of the cave, but many, especially the rounded ones, are from\r\nmore distant parts of the surrounding country. In this mass, the depth\r\nof which is unknown, are numerous bones, all of one kind of animal,\r\nthe cave bear, a creature which seems to have lived in Western Europe\r\nfrom the close of the Pliocene down to the modern period. It must have\r\nbeen one of the earliest and most permanent tenants of Kent's Hole at\r\na time when its lower chambers were still filled with water. Next\r\nabove the breccia is a floor of \"stalagmite\" or stony carbonate of\r\nlime, deposited from the drippings of the roof, and in some places\r\nthree feet thick. This also contains bones of the cave bear, deposited\r\nwhen there was less access of water to the cavern. Mr. Pengelly infers\r\nthe existence of man at this time from a single flint flake and a\r\nsingle flint chip found in these beds; but mere flakes and chips of\r\nflint are too often natural to warrant such a conclusion. After the\r\nold stalagmite floor above mentioned was formed, the cave again\r\nreceived deposits of muddy water and stones; but now a change occurs\r\nin the remains embedded. This stony clay, or \"cave earth\" has yielded\r\nan immense quantity of teeth and bones, including those of the\r\nelephant, rhinoceros, horse, hyena, cave bear, reindeer, and Irish\r\nelk. With these were found weapons of chipped flint, and harpoons,\r\nneedles, and bodkins of bone, precisely similar to those of the North\r\nAmerican Indians and other rude races. The \"cave earth\" is four feet\r\nor more in thickness, It is not stratified, and contains many fallen\r\nfragments of rock, rounded stones, and broken pieces of stalagmite. It\r\nalso has patches of the excrement of hyenas, which the explorers\r\nsuppose to indicate the temporary residence of these animals; and in\r\none spot, near the top, is a limited layer of burnt wood, with remains\r\nwhich indicate the cooking and eating of repasts of animal food by\r\nman. It is clear that when this bed was formed the cavern was liable\r\nto be inundated with muddy water, carrying stones and other heavy\r\nobjects, and breaking up in places the old stalagmite floor. One of\r\nthe most puzzling features, especially to those who take an\r\nexclusively uniformitarian view, is, that the entrance of water-borne\r\nmud and stones implies a level of the bottom of the water in the\r\nneighbouring valleys of about 100 feet above its present height. The\r\ncave earth is covered by a second crust of stalagmite, less dense and\r\nthick then that below, and containing only a few bones, which are of\r\nthe same general character with those below, but include a fragment of\r\na human jaw with teeth. Evidently, when this stalagmite was formed,\r\nthe influx of water-borne materials had ceased, or nearly so; but\r\nwhether the animals previously occupying the country still continued\r\nin it, or only accidental bones, etc., were introduced into the cave\r\nor lifted from the bed below, does not appear.\r\n\r\nThe next bed marks a new change. It is a layer of black mould from\r\nthree to ten inches thick. Its microscopic structure does not seem to\r\nhave been examined; but it is probably a forest soil, introduced by\r\ngrowth, by water, by wind, and by ingress of animals, at a time when\r\nthe cave was nearly in its present state, and the surrounding country\r\ndensely wooded. This bed contains bones of animals, all of them\r\nmodern, and works of art ranging from the old British times before the\r\nRoman invasion up to the porter-bottles and dropped halfpence of\r\nmodern visitors. Lastly, in and upon the black mould are many fallen\r\nblocks from the roof of the cave.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that this cave and the neighbouring one of\r\nBrixham have done very much to impress the minds of British geologists\r\nwith ideas of the great antiquity of man, and they have, more then any\r\nother Post-glacial monuments, shown the persistence of some animals\r\nnow extinct up to the human age. Of precise data for determining time,\r\nthey have, however, given nothing. The only measures which seed to\r\nhave been applied, namely, the rate of growth of stalagmite and the\r\nrate of erosion of the neighbouring valleys, are, from the very\r\nsequence of the deposits, obviously worthless; and the only apparently\r\navailable constant measure, namely, the fall of blocks from the roof,\r\nseems not yet to have been applied. We are therefore quite uncertain\r\nas to the number of centuries involved in the filling of this cave,\r\nand must remain so until a surer system of calculation is adopted. We\r\nmay, however, attempt to sketch the series of events which it\r\nindicates.\r\n\r\nThe animals found in Kent's Hole are all \"Post-glacial.\" They\r\ntherefore inhabited the country after it rose from the great Glacial\r\nsubmergence. Perhaps the first colonists of the coasts of Devonshire\r\nin this period were the cave bears, migrating on floating ice, and\r\nsubsisting, like the Arctic bear, and the black bears of Anticosti, on\r\nfish, and on the garbage cast up by the sea. They found Kent's Hole a\r\nsea-side cavern, with perhaps some of its galleries still full of\r\nwater, and filling with, breccia, with which the bones of dead bears\r\nbecame mixed. As the land rose, these creatures for the most part\r\nbetook themselves to lower levels, and in process of time the cavern\r\nstood upon a hill-side, perhaps several hundreds of feet above the\r\nsea; and the mountain torrents, their beds not yet emptied of glacial\r\ndetritus, washed into it stones and mud and carcases of animals of\r\nmany species which had now swarmed across the plains elevated out of\r\nthe sea, and multiplied in the land. This was the time of the cave\r\nearth; and before its deposit was completed, though how long before, a\r\nconfused and often-disturbed bed of this kind cannot tell, man himself\r\nseems to have been added to the inhabitants of the British land. In\r\npursuit of game he sometimes ascended the valleys beyond the cavern,\r\nor even penetrated into its outer chambers; or perhaps there were even\r\nin those days rude and savage hill-men, inhabiting the forests and\r\nwarring with the more cultivated denizens of plains below, which are\r\nnow deep under the waters. Their weapons, lost in hunting, or buried\r\nin the flesh of wounded animals which crept to the streams to assuage\r\ntheir thirst, are those found in the cave earth. The absence of human\r\nbones may merely show that the mighty hunters of those days were too\r\nhardy, athletic, and intelligent, often to perish from accidental\r\ncauses, and that they did not use this cavern for a place of burial.\r\nBut the land again subsided. The valley of that now nameless river, of\r\nwhich the Rhine the themes, and the Severn may have alike been\r\ntributaries, disappeared under the sea; and some tribe, driven from\r\nthe lower lands, took refuge in this cave, now again near the\r\nencroaching waves, and left there the remains of their last repasts\r\nere they were driven farther inland or engulfed in the waters. For a\r\ntime the cavern may have been wholly submerged, and the charcoal of\r\nthe extinguished fires became covered with its thin coating of clay.\r\nBut ere long it re-emerged to form part of an island, long barren and\r\ndesolate; and the valleys having been cut deeper by the receding\r\nwaters, it no longer received muddy deposits, and the crust formed by\r\ndrippings from its roof contained only bones and pebbles washed by\r\nrains or occasional land floods from its own clay deposits. Finally,\r\nthe modern forests overspread the land, and were tenanted by the\r\nmodern animals. Man returned to use the cavern again as a place of\r\nrefuge or habitation, and to leave there the relics contained in the\r\nblack earth. This seems at present the only intelligible history of\r\nthis curious cave and others resembling it; though, when we consider\r\nthe imperfection of the results obtained even by a large amount of\r\nlabour, and the difficult and confused character of the deposits in\r\nthis and similar caves, too much value should not be attached to such\r\nhistories, which may at any time be contradicted or modified by new\r\nfacts or different explanations of those already known. The time\r\ninvolved depends very much, as already stated, on the question whether\r\nwe regard the Post-glacial subsidence and re-elevation as somewhat\r\nsudden, or as occupying long ages at the slow rate at which some\r\nparts of our continents are now rising or sinking.[AT]\r\n\r\n[AT] Another element in this is also the question raised by Dawkins,\r\nGeikie, and others as to subdivisions of the Post-glacial period and\r\nintermissions of the Glacial cold. After careful consideration of\r\nthese views, however, I cannot consider them as of much importance.\r\n\r\nSuch are the glimpses, obscure though stimulating to the imagination,\r\nwhich geology can give of the circumstances attending the appearance\r\nof man in Western Europe. How far we are from being able to account\r\nfor his origin, or to give its circumstances and relative dates for\r\nthe whole world, the reader will readily understand. Still it is\r\nsomething to know that there is an intelligible meeting-place of the\r\nlater geological ages and the age of man, and that it is one inviting\r\nto many and hopeful researches. It is curious also to find that the\r\nfew monuments disinterred by geology, the antediluvian record of Holy\r\nScripture, and the golden age of heathen tradition, seem alike to\r\npoint to similar physical conditions, and to that simple state of the\r\narts of life in which \"gold and wampum and flint stones\"[AU]\r\nconstituted the chief material treasures of the earliest tribes of\r\nmen. They also point to the immeasurable elevation, then as now, of\r\nman over his brute rivals for the dominion of the earth. To the\r\nnaturalist this subject opens up most inviting yet most difficult\r\npaths of research, to be entered on with caution and reverence,\r\nrather then in the bold and dashing spirit of many modern attempts.\r\nThe Christian, on his part, may feel satisfied that the scattered\r\nmonumental relics of the caves and gravels will tell no story very\r\ndifferent from that which he has long believed on other evidence, nor\r\nanything inconsistent with those views of man's heavenly origin and\r\ndestiny which have been the most precious inheritance of the greatest\r\nand best minds of every age, from that early pre-historic period when\r\nmen, \"palaeolithic\" men, no doubt, began to \"invoke the name of\r\nJehovah,\" the coming Saviour, down to those times when life and\r\nimmortality are brought to light, for all who will see, by the Saviour\r\nalready come.\r\n\r\n[AU] So I read the \"gold, bedolah, and shoham\" of the description of\r\nEden in Genesis ii.--the oldest literary record of the stone age.\r\n\r\nIn completing this series of pictures, I wish emphatically to insist\r\non the imperfection of the sketches which I have been able to present,\r\nand which are less, in comparison with the grand march of the creative\r\nwork, even as now imperfectly known to science, then the roughest\r\npencilling of a child when compared with a finished picture. If they\r\nhave any popular value, it will be in presenting such a broad general\r\nview of a great subject as may induce further study to fill up the\r\ndetails. If they have any scientific value, it will be in removing the\r\nminds of British students for a little from the too exclusive study of\r\ntheir own limited marginal area, which has been to them too much the\r\n\"celestial empire\" around which all other countries must be arranged,\r\nand in divesting the subject of the special colouring given to it by\r\ncertain prominent cliques and parties.\r\n\r\nGeology as a science is at present in a peculiar and somewhat\r\nexceptional state. Under the influence of a few men of commanding\r\ngenius belonging to the generation now passing away, it has made so\r\ngigantic conquests that its armies have broken up into bands of\r\nspecialists, little better then scientific banditti, liable to be\r\nbeaten in detail, and prone to commit outrages on common sense and\r\ngood taste, which bring their otherwise good cause into disrepute. The\r\nleaders of these bands are, many of them, good soldiers, but few of\r\nthem fitted to be general officers, and none of them able to reunite\r\nour scattered detachments. We need larger minds, of broader culture\r\nand wider sympathies, to organise and rule the lands which we have\r\nsubdued, and to lead on to further conquests.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of natural science in Britain, this evil is\r\nperhaps to be remedied only by providing a wider and deeper culture\r\nfor our young men. Few of our present workers have enjoyed that\r\nthorough training in mental as well as physical science, which is\r\nnecessary to enable men even of great powers to take large and lofty\r\nviews of the scheme of nature. Hence we often find men who are fair\r\nworkers in limited departments, reasoning most illogically, taking\r\nnarrow and local views, elevating the exception into the rule, led\r\naway by baseless metaphysical subtleties, quarrelling with men who\r\nlook at their specialties from a different point of view, and even\r\nstriving and plotting for the advancement of their own hobbies. Such\r\ndefects certainly mar much of the scientific work now being done. In\r\nthe more advanced walks of scientific research, they are to some\r\nextent neutralised by that free discussion which true science always\r\nfosters; though even here they sometimes vexatiously arrest the\r\nprogress of truth, or open floodgates of error which it may require\r\nmuch labour to close. But in public lectures and popular publications\r\nthey run riot, and are stimulated by the mistaken opposition of\r\nnarrow-minded good men, by the love of the new and sensational, and by\r\nthe rivalry of men struggling for place and position. To launch a\r\nclever and startling fallacy which will float for a week and stir up a\r\nhard fight, seems almost as great a triumph as the discovery of an\r\nimportant fact or law; and the honest student is distracted with the\r\nmultitude of doctrines, and hustled aside by the crowd of ambitious\r\ngroundlings.\r\n\r\nThe only remedy in the case is a higher and more general scientific\r\neducation; and yet I do not wonder that many good men object to this,\r\nsimply because of the difficulty of finding honest and competent\r\nteachers, themselves well grounded in their subjects, and free from\r\nthat too common insanity of specialists and half-educated men, which\r\nimpels them to run amuck at everything that does not depend on their\r\nown methods of research. This is a difficulty which can be met in our\r\ntime only by the general good sense and right feeling of the\r\ncommunity taking a firm hold of the matter, and insisting on the\r\norganization and extension of the higher scientific education, as well\r\nas that of a more elementary character, under the management of able\r\nand sane men. Yet even if not so counteracted, present follies will\r\npass away, and a new and better state of natural science will arise in\r\nthe future, by its own internal development. Science cannot long\r\nsuccessfully isolate itself from God. Its life lies in the fact that\r\nit is the exponent of the plans and works of the great Creative Will.\r\nIt must, in spite of itself, serve His purposes, by dispelling\r\nblighting ignorance and superstition, by lighting the way to\r\nsuccessive triumphs of human skill over the powers of nature, and by\r\nguarding men from the evils that flow from infringement of natural\r\nlaws. And it cannot fail, as it approaches nearer to the boundaries of\r\nthat which may be known by finite minds, to be humbled by the\r\ncontemplation of the infinite, and to recognise therein that\r\nintelligence of which the human mind is but the image and shadow.\r\n\r\nIt may be that theologians also are needed who shall be fit to take\r\nthe place of Moses to our generation, in teaching it again the very\r\nelements of natural theology; but let them not look upon science as a\r\ncold and godless demon, holding forth to the world a poisoned cup\r\ncunningly compounded of truth and falsehood; but rather as the natural\r\nally and associate of the gospel of salvation. The matter is so put in\r\none of those visions which close the canon of revelation, when the\r\nprophet sees a mighty angel having the \"everlasting gospel to preach;\"\r\nbut he begins his proclamation by calling on men to \"worship Him _that\r\nmade heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of waters_.\" Men\r\nmust know God as the Creator even before they seek Him as a benefactor\r\nand redeemer. Thus religion must go hand in hand with all true and\r\nhonest science. In this way only may we look forward to a time when a\r\nmore exact and large-minded science shall be in perfect accord with a\r\nmore pure and spiritual Christianity, when the natural and the\r\nspiritual shall be seen to be the necessary complements of each other,\r\nand when we shall hear no more of reconciliations between science and\r\ntheology, because there will be no quarrels to reconcile. Already,\r\neven in the present chaos of scientific and religious opinion,\r\nindications can be seen by the observant, that the Divine Spirit of\r\norder is breathing on the mass, and will evolve from it new and\r\nbeautiful worlds of mental and spiritual existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE MAN. CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO MODERN THEORIES AS TO HIS\r\nORIGIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geological record, as we have been reading it, introduces us to\r\nprimitive man, but gives us no distinct information as to his origin.\r\nTradition and revelation have, it is true, their solutions of the\r\nmystery, but there are, and always have been, many who will not take\r\nthese on trust, but must grope for themselves with the taper of\r\nscience or philosophy into the dark caverns whence issue the springs\r\nof humanity. In former times it was philosophic speculation alone\r\nwhich lent its dim and uncertain light to these bold inquirers; but in\r\nour day the new and startling discoveries in physics, chemistry, and\r\nbiology have flashed up with an unexpected brilliancy, and have at\r\nleast served to dazzle the eyes and encourage the hopes of the\r\ncurious, and to lead to explorations more bold and systematic then any\r\npreviously undertaken. Thus has been born amongst us, or rather\r\nrenewed, for it is a very old thing, that evolutionist philosophy,\r\nwhich has been well characterised as the \"baldest of all the\r\nphilosophies which have sprung up in our world,\" and which solves the\r\nquestion of human origin by the assumption that human nature exists\r\npotentially in mere inorganic matter, and that a chain of spontaneous\r\nderivation connects incandescent molecules or star-dust with the\r\nworld, and with man himself.\r\n\r\nThis evolutionist doctrine is itself one of the strangest phenomena of\r\nhumanity. It existed, and most naturally, in the oldest philosophy and\r\npoetry, in connection with the crudest and most uncritical, attempts\r\nof the human mind to grasp the system of nature; but that in our day a\r\nsystem destitute of any shadow of proof, and supported merely by vague\r\nanalogies and figures of speech, and by the arbitrary and artificial\r\ncoherence of its own parts, should be accepted as a philosophy, and\r\nshould find able adherents to string upon its thread of hypotheses our\r\nvast and weighty stores of knowledge, is surpassingly strange. It\r\nseems to indicate that the accumulated facts of our age have gone\r\naltogether beyond its capacity for generalisation; and but for the\r\nvigour which one sees everywhere, it might be taken as an indication\r\nthat the human mind has fallen into a state of senility, and in its\r\ndotage mistakes for science the imaginations which were the dreams of\r\nits youth.\r\n\r\nIn many respects these speculations are important and worthy of the\r\nattention of thinking men. They seek to revolutionise the religious\r\nbeliefs of the world, and if accepted would destroy most of the\r\nexisting theology and philosophy. They indicate tendencies among\r\nscientific thinkers, which, though probably temporary, must, before\r\nthey disappear, descend to lower strata, and reproduce themselves in\r\ngrosser forms, and with most serious effects on the whole structure\r\nof society. With one class of minds they constitute a sort of\r\nreligion, which so far satisfies the craving for truths higher then\r\nthose which relate to immediate wants and pleasures. With another and\r\nperhaps larger class, they are accepted as affording a welcome\r\ndeliverance from all scruples of conscience and fears of a hereafter.\r\nIn the domain of science evolutionism has like tendencies. It reduces\r\nthe position of man, who becomes a descendant of inferior animals, and\r\na mere term in a series whose end is unknown. It removes from the\r\nstudy of nature the ideas of final cause and purpose; and the\r\nevolutionist, instead of regarding the world as a work of consummate\r\nplan, skill, and adjustment, approaches nature as he would a chaos of\r\nfallen rocks, which may present forms of castles and grotesque\r\nprofiles of men and animals, but they are all fortuitous and without\r\nsignificance. It obliterates the fine perception of differences from\r\nthe mind of the naturalist, and resolves all the complicated relations\r\nof living things into some simple idea of descent with modification.\r\nIt thus destroys the possibility of a philosophical classification,\r\nreducing all things to a mere series, and leads to a rapid decay in\r\nsystematic zoology and botany, which is already very manifest among\r\nthe disciples of Spencer and Darwin in England. The effect of this\r\nwill be, if it proceeds further, in a great degree to destroy the\r\neducational value and popular interest attaching to these sciences,\r\nand to throw them down at the feet of a system of debased\r\nmetaphysics. As redeeming features in all this, are the careful study\r\nof varietal forms, and the inquiries as to the limits of species,\r\nwhich have sprung from these discussions, and the harvest of which\r\nwill be reaped by the true naturalists of the future.\r\n\r\nThus these theories as to the origin of men and animals and plants are\r\nfull of present significance, and may be studied with profit by all;\r\nand in no part of their applications more usefully then in that which\r\nrelates to man. Let us then inquire,--1. What is implied in the idea of\r\nevolution as applied to man? 2. What is implied in the idea of\r\ncreation? 3. How these several views accord with what we actually know\r\nas the result of scientific investigation? The first and second of\r\nthese questions may well occupy the whole of this chapter, and we\r\nshall be able merely to glance at their leading aspects. In doing so,\r\nit may be well first to place before us in general terms the several\r\nalternatives which evolutionists offer, as to the mode in which the\r\nhonour of an origin from apes or ape-like animals can be granted to\r\nus, along with the opposite view as to the independent origin of man\r\nwhich have been maintained either on scientific or scriptural grounds.\r\n\r\nAll the evolutionist theories of the origin of man depend primarily on\r\nthe possibility of his having been produced from some of the animals\r\nmore closely allied to him, by the causes now in operation which lead\r\nto varietal forms, or by similar causes which have been in operation;\r\nand some attach more and others less weight to certain of these\r\ncauses, or gratuitously suppose others not actually known. Of such\r\ncauses of change some are internal and others external to the\r\norganism. With respect to the former, one school assumes an innate\r\ntendency in every species to change in the course of time.[AV] Another\r\nbelieves in exceptional births, either in the course of ordinary\r\ngeneration or by the mode of parthenogenesis.[AW] Another refers to\r\nthe known facts of reproductive accelleration or retardation observed\r\nin some humble creatures.[AX] New forms arising in any of these ways\r\nor fortuitously, may, it is supposed, be perpetuated and increased and\r\nfurther improved by favouring external circumstances and the effort of\r\nthe organism to avail itself of these,[AY] or by the struggle for\r\nexistence and the survival of the fittest.[AZ]\r\n\r\n[AV] Parsons, Owen.\r\n\r\n[AW] Mivart, Ferris.\r\n\r\n[AX] Hyatt and Cope.\r\n\r\n[AY] Lamarck, etc.\r\n\r\n[AZ] Darwin, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those who believe in the independent origin of man\r\nadmit the above causes as adequate only to produce mere varieties,\r\nliable to return into the original stock. They may either hold that\r\nman has appeared as a product of special and miraculous creation, or\r\nthat he has been created mediately by the operation of forces also\r\nconcerned in the production of other animals, but the precise nature\r\nof which is still unknown to us; or lastly, they may hold what seems\r\nto be the view favoured by the book of Genesis, that his bodily form\r\nis a product of mediate creation and his spiritual nature a direct\r\nemanation from his Creator.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of all these rival theories would occupy volumes, and\r\nto follow them into details would require investigations which have\r\nalready bewildered many minds of some scientific culture. Further, it\r\nis the belief of the writer that this plunging into multitudes of\r\ndetails has been fruitful of error, and that it will be a better\r\ncourse to endeavour to reach the root of the matter by looking at the\r\nfoundations of the general doctrine of evolution itself, and then\r\ncontrasting it with its rival.\r\n\r\nTaking, then, this broad view of the subject, two great leading\r\nalternatives are presented to us. Either man is an independent product\r\nof the will of a Higher Intelligence, acting directly or through the\r\nlaws and materials of his own institution and production, or he has\r\nbeen produced by an unconscious evolution from lower things. It is\r\ntrue that many evolutionists, either unwilling to offend, or not\r\nperceiving the logical consequences of their own hypothesis, endeavour\r\nto steer a middle course, and to maintain that the Creator has\r\nproceeded by way of evolution. But the bare, hard logic of Spencer,\r\nthe greatest English authority on evolution, leaves no place for this\r\ncompromise, and shows that the theory, carried out to its legitimate\r\nconsequences, excludes the knowledge of a Creator and the possibility\r\nof His work. We have, therefore, to choose between evolution and\r\ncreation; bearing in mind, however, that there may be a place in\r\nnature for evolution, properly limited, as well as for other things,\r\nand that the idea of creation by no means excludes law and second\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nLimiting ourselves in the first place to theories of evolution, and to\r\nthese as explaining the origin of species of living beings, and\r\nespecially of man, we naturally first inquire as to the basis on which\r\nthey are founded. Now no one pretends that they rest on facts actually\r\nobserved, for no one has ever observed the production of even one\r\nspecies. Nor do they even rest, like the deductions of theoretical\r\ngeology, on the extension into past time of causes of change now seen\r\nto be in action. Their probability depends entirely on their capacity\r\nto account hypothetically for certain relations of living creatures to\r\neach other, and to the world without; and the strongest point of the\r\narguments of their advocates is the accumulation of cases of such\r\nrelations supposed to be accounted for. Such being the kind of\r\nargument with which we have to deal, we may first inquire what we are\r\nrequired to believe as conditions of the action of evolution, and\r\nsecondly, to what extent it actually does explain the phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, as evolutionists, we are required to assume\r\ncertain forces, or materials, or both, with which evolution shall\r\nbegin. Darwin, in his Origin of Species, went so far as to assume the\r\nexistence of a few of the simpler types of animals; but this view, of\r\ncourse, was only a temporary resting-place for his theory. Others\r\nassume a primitive protoplasm, or physical basis of life, and\r\narbitrarily assigning to this substance properties now divided between\r\norganised and unorganised, and between dead and living matter, find no\r\ndifficulty in deducing all plants and animals from it. Still, even\r\nthis cannot have been the ultimate material. It must have been evolved\r\nfrom something. We are thus brought back to certain molecules of\r\nstar-dust, or certain conflicting forces, which must have had\r\nself-existence, and must have potentially included all subsequent\r\ncreatures. Otherwise, if with Spencer we hold that God is \"unknowable\"\r\nand creation \"unthinkable,\" we are left suspended on nothing over a\r\nbottomless void, and must adopt as the initial proposition of our\r\nphilosophy, that all things were made out of nothing, and by nothing;\r\nunless we prefer to doubt whether anything exists, and to push the\r\ndoctrine of relativity to the unscientific extreme of believing that\r\nwe can study the relations of things non-existent or unknown. So we\r\nmust allow the evolutionist some small capital to start with;\r\nobserving, however, that self-existent matter in a state of endless\r\nevolution is something of which we cannot possibly have any definite\r\nconception.\r\n\r\nBeing granted thus much, the evolutionist next proceeds to demand that\r\nwe shall also believe in the indefinite variability of material\r\nthings, and shall set aside all idea that there is any difference in\r\nkind between the different substances which we know. They must all be\r\nmutually convertible, or at least derivable from some primitive\r\nmaterial. It is true that this is contrary to experience. The chemist\r\nholds that matter is of different kinds, that one element cannot be\r\nconverted into another; and he would probably smile if told that, even\r\nin the lapse of enormous periods of time, limestone could be evolved\r\nout of silica. He may think that this is very different from the idea\r\nthat a snail can be evolved from an oyster, or a bird from a reptile.\r\nBut the zoologist will inform him that species of animals are only\r\nvariable within certain limits, and are not transmutable, in so far as\r\nexperience and experiment are concerned. They have their allotropic\r\nforms, but cannot be changed into one another.\r\n\r\nBut if we grant this second demand, the evolutionist has a third in\r\nstore for us. We must also admit that by some inevitable necessity the\r\nchanges of things must in the main take place in one direction, from\r\nthe more simple to the more complex, from the lower to the higher. At\r\nfirst sight this seems not only to follow from the previous\r\nassumptions, but to accord with observation. Do not all living things\r\nrise from a simpler to a more complex state? has not the history of\r\nthe earth displayed a gradually increasing elevation and complexity?\r\nBut, on the other hand, the complex organism becoming mature, resolves\r\nitself again into the simple germ, and finally is dissolved into its\r\nconstituent elements. The complex returns into the simple, and what we\r\nsee is not an evolution, but a revolution. In like manner, in\r\ngeological time, the tendency seems to be ever to disintegration and\r\ndecay. This we see everywhere, and find that elevation occurs only by\r\nthe introduction of new species in a way which is not obvious, and\r\nwhich may rather imply the intervention of a cause from without; so\r\nthat here also we are required to admit as a general principle what is\r\ncontrary to experience.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we grant the evolutionist these postulates, we must next\r\nallow him to take the facts of botany and zoology out of their\r\nordinary connection, and thread them like a string of beads, as\r\nHerbert Spencer has done in his \"Biology,\" on the threefold cord thus\r\nfashioned. This done, we next find, as might have been expected,\r\ncertain gaps or breaks which require to be cunningly filled with\r\nartificial material, in order to give an appearance of continuity to\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nThe first of these gaps which we notice is that between dead and\r\nliving matter. It is easy to fill this with such a term as protoplasm,\r\nwhich includes matter both dead and living, and so to ignore this\r\ndistinction; but practically we do not yet know as a possible thing\r\nthe elevation of matter, without the agency of a previous living\r\norganism, from that plane in which it is subject merely to physical\r\nforce, and is unorganised, to that where it becomes organised, and\r\nlives. Under that strange hypothesis of the origin of life from\r\nmeteors, with which Sir William Thomson closed his address at a late\r\nmeeting of the British Association, there was concealed a cutting\r\nsarcasm which the evolutionists felt. It reminded them that the men\r\nwho evolve all things from physical forces do not yet know how these\r\nforces can produce the phenomena of life even in its humblest forms.\r\nIt is true that the scientific world has been again and again startled\r\nby the announcement of the production of some of the lowest forms of\r\nlife, either from dead organic matter, or from merely mineral\r\nsubstances; but in every case heretofore the effort has proved as vain\r\nas the analogies attempted to be set up between the formation of\r\ncrystals and that of organized tissues are fallacious.\r\n\r\nA second gap is that which separates vegetable and animal life. These\r\nare necessarily the converse of each other, the one deoxidizes and\r\naccumulates, the other oxidizes and expends. Only in reproduction or\r\ndecay does the plant simulate the action of the animal, and the animal\r\nnever in its simplest forms assumes the functions of the plant. Those\r\nobscure cases in the humbler spheres of animal and vegetable life\r\nwhich have been supposed to show a union of the two kingdoms,\r\ndisappear on investigation. This gap can, I believe, be filled up only\r\nby an appeal to our ignorance. There may be, or may have been, some\r\nsimple creature unknown to us, on the extreme verge of the plant\r\nkingdom, that was capable of passing the limit and becoming an animal.\r\nBut no proof of this exists. It is true that the primitive germs of\r\nmany kinds of humble plants and animals are so much alike, that much\r\nconfusion has arisen in tracing their development. It is also true\r\nthat some of these creatures can subsist under very dissimilar\r\nconditions, and in very diverse states, and that under the specious\r\nname of Biology,[BA] we sometimes find a mass of these confusions,\r\ninaccurate observations and varietal differences made to do duty for\r\nscientific facts. But all this does not invalidate the grand primary\r\ndistinction between the animal and the plant, which should be\r\nthoroughly taught and illustrated to all young naturalists, as one of\r\nthe best antidotes to the fallacies of the evolutionist school.\r\n\r\n[BA] It is doubtful whether men who deny the existence of vital force\r\nhave a right to call their science \"Biology,\" any more then atheists\r\nhave to call their doctrine \"Theology;\" and it is certain that the\r\nassumption of a science of Biology as distinct from Phytology and\r\nZoology, or including both, is of the nature of a \"pious fraud\" on the\r\npart of the more enlightened evolutionists. The objections stated in\r\nthe text, to what have been called Archebiosis and Heterogenesis seem\r\nperfectly applicable, in so far as I can judge from a friendly review\r\nby Wallace, to the mass of heterogeneous material accumulated by Dr.\r\nBastian in his recent volumes. The conclusions of this writer, would\r\nalso, if established, involve evolution in a fatal _embarras des\r\nrichesses_, by the hourly production during all geological time, of\r\nmillions of new forms all capable of indefinite development.\r\n\r\nA third is that between any species of animal or plant and any other\r\nspecies. It was this gap, and this only, which Darwin undertook to\r\nfill up by his great work on the origin of species, but,\r\nnotwithstanding the immense amount of material thus expended, it yawns\r\nas wide as ever, since it must be admitted that no case has been\r\nascertained in which an individual of one species has transgressed the\r\nlimits between it and other species. However extensive the varieties\r\nproduced by artificial breeding, the essential characters of the\r\nspecies remain, and even its minor characters may be reproduced, while\r\nthe barriers established in nature between species by the laws of\r\ntheir reproduction, seem to be absolute.\r\n\r\nWith regard to species, however, it must be observed that naturalists\r\nare not agreed as to what constitutes a species. Many so-called\r\nspecies are probably races, or varieties, and one benefit of these\r\ninquiries has been to direct attention to the proper discrimination of\r\nspecies from varieties among animals and plants. The loose\r\ndiscrimination of species, and the tendency to multiply names, have\r\ndone much to promote evolutionist views; but the researches of the\r\nevolutionists themselves have shown that we must abandon transmutation\r\nof true species as a thing of the present; and if we imagine it to\r\nhave occurred, must refer it to the past.\r\n\r\nAnother gap is that between the nature of the animal and the\r\nself-conscious, reasoning, moral nature of man. We not only have no\r\nproof that any animal can, by any force in itself, or by any merely\r\nphysical influences from without, rise to such a condition; but the\r\nthing is in the highest degree improbable. It is easy to affirm, with\r\nthe grosser materialists, that thought is a secretion of brain, as\r\nbile is of the liver; but a moment's thought shows that no real\r\nanalogy obtains between the cases. We may vaguely suppose, with\r\nDarwin, that the continual exercise of such powers as animals possess,\r\nmay have developed those of man. But our experience of animals shows\r\nthat their intelligence differs essentially from that of man, being a\r\nclosed circle ever returning into itself, while that of man is\r\nprogressive, inventive, and accumulative, and can no more be\r\ncorrelated with that of the animal then the vital phenomena of the\r\nanimal with those of the plant. Nor can the gap between the higher\r\nreligious and moral sentiments of man, and the instinctive affections\r\nof the brutes, be filled up with that miserable ape imagined by\r\nLubbock, which, crossed in love, or pining with cold and hunger,\r\nconceived, for the first time in its poor addled pate, \"the dread of\r\nevil to come,\" and so became the father of theology. This conception,\r\nwhich Darwin gravely adopts, would be most ludicrous, but for the\r\nfrightful picture which it gives of the aspect in which religion\r\nappears to the mind of the evolutionist.\r\n\r\nThe reader will now readily perceive that the simplicity and\r\ncompleteness of the evolutionist theory entirely disappear when we\r\nconsider the unproved assumptions on which it is based, and its\r\nfailure to connect with each other some of the most important facts in\r\nnature: that, in short, it is not in any true sense a philosophy, but\r\nmerely an arbitrary arrangement of facts in accordance with a number\r\nof unproved hypotheses. Such philosophies, \"falsely so called,\" have\r\nexisted ever since man began to reason on nature, and this last of\r\nthem is one of the weakest and most pernicious of the whole. Let the\r\nreader take up either of Darwin's great books, or Spencer's \"Biology,\"\r\nand merely ask himself as he reads each paragraph, \"What is assumed\r\nhere and what is proved?\" and he will find the whole fabric melt away\r\nlike a vision. He will find, however, one difference between these\r\nwriters. Darwin always states facts carefully and accurately, and when\r\nhe comes to a difficulty tries to meet it fairly. Spencer often\r\nexaggerates or extenuates with reference to his facts, and uses the\r\narts of the dialectician where argument fails.\r\n\r\nMany naturalists who should know better are puzzled with the great\r\narray of facts presented by evolutionists; and while their better\r\njudgment causes them to doubt as to the possibility of the structures\r\nwhich they study being produced by such blind and material processes,\r\nare forced to admit that there must surely be something in a theory so\r\nconfidently asserted, supported by so great names, and by such an\r\nimposing array of relations which it can explain. They would be\r\nrelieved from their weak concessions were they to study carefully a\r\nfew of the instances adduced, and to consider how easy it is by a\r\nlittle ingenuity to group undoubted facts around a false theory. I\r\ncould wish to present here illustrations of this, which abound in\r\nevery part of the works I have referred to, but space will not permit.\r\nOne or two must suffice. The first may be taken from one of the\r\nstrong points often dwelt on by Spencer in his \"Biology.\"[BB]\r\n\r\n[BB] \"Principles of Biology,\" § 118.\r\n\r\n\"But the experiences which most clearly illustrate to us the process\r\nof general evolution are our experiences of special evolution,\r\nrepeated in every plant and animal. Each organism exhibits, within a\r\nshort space of time, a series of changes which, when supposed to\r\noccupy a period indefinitely great and to go on in various ways\r\ninstead of one, may give us a tolerably clear conception of organic\r\nevolution in general. In an individual development we have compressed\r\ninto a comparatively infinitesimal space a series of metamorphoses\r\nequally vast with those which the hypothesis of evolution assumes to\r\nhave taken place during those unmeasurable epochs that the earth's\r\ncrust tells us of. A tree differs from a seed immeasurably in every\r\nrespect--in bulk, in structure, in colour, in form, in specific\r\ngravity, in chemical composition: differs so greatly that no visible\r\nresemblance of any kind can be pointed out between them. Yet is the\r\none changed in the course of a few years into the other; changed so\r\ngradually that at no moment can it be said, 'Now the seed ceases to be\r\nand the tree exists.' What can be more widely contrasted then a\r\nnewly-born child and the small gelatinous spherule constituting the\r\nhuman ovum? The infant is so complex in structure that a cyclopædia\r\nis needed to describe its constituent parts. The germinal vesicle is\r\nso simple that it may be defined in a line.... If a single cell under\r\nappropriate conditions becomes a man in the space of a few years,\r\nthere can surely be no difficulty in understanding how, under\r\nappropriate conditions, a cell may in the course of untold millions of\r\nyears give origin to the human race.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true that many minds are so unfurnished with those experiences\r\nof nature, out of which this conception is built, that they find\r\ndifficulty in forming it.... To such the hypothesis that by any series\r\nof changes a protozoan should ever give origin to a mammal seems\r\ngrotesque--as grotesque as did Galileo's assertion of the earth's\r\nmovement seem to the Aristoteleans; or as grotesque as the assertion\r\nof the earth's sphericity seems now to the New Zealanders.\"\r\n\r\nI quote the above as a specimen of evolutionist reasoning from the\r\nhand of a master, and as referring to one of the corner-stones of this\r\nstrange philosophy. I may remark with respect to it, in the first\r\nplace, that it assumes those \"conditions\" of evolution to which I have\r\nalready referred. In the second place, it is full of inaccurate\r\nstatements of fact, all in a direction tending to favour the\r\nhypothesis. For example, a tree does not differ \"immeasurably\" from a\r\nseed, especially if the seed is of the same species of tree, for the\r\nprincipal parts of the tree and its principal chemical constituents\r\nalready exist and can be detected in the seed, and unless it were so,\r\nthe development of the tree from the seed could not take place.\r\nBesides, the seed itself is not a thing self-existent or fortuitous.\r\nThe production of a seed without a previous tree of the same kind is\r\nquite as difficult to suppose as the production of a tree without a\r\nprevious seed containing its living embryo. In the third place, the\r\nwhole argument is one of analogy. The germ becomes a mature animal,\r\npassing through many intermediate stages, therefore the animal may\r\nhave descended from some creature which when mature was as simple as\r\nthe germ. The value of such an analogy depends altogether on the\r\nsimilarity of the \"conditions\" which, in such a case, are really the\r\nefficient causes at work. The germ of a mammal becomes developed by\r\nthe nourishment supplied from the system of a parent, which itself\r\nproduced the germ, and into whose likeness the young animal is\r\ndestined to grow. These are the \"appropriate conditions\" of its\r\ndevelopment. But when our author assumes from this other \"appropriate\r\nconditions,\" by which an organism, which on the hypothesis is not a\r\ngerm but a mature animal, shall be developed into the likeness, of\r\nsomething different from its parent, he oversteps the bounds of\r\nlegitimate analogy. Further, the reproduction of the animal, as\r\nobserved, is a closed series, beginning at the embryo and returning\r\nthither again; the evolution attempted to be established is a\r\nprogressive series going on from one stage to another. A reproductive\r\ncircle once established obeys certain definite laws, but its origin,\r\nor how it can leave its orbit and revolve in some other, we cannot\r\nexplain without the introduction of some new efficient cause. The one\r\nterm of the analogy is a revolution, and the other is an evolution.\r\nThe revolution within the circle of the reproduction of the species\r\ngives no evidence that at some point the body will fly off at a\r\ntangent, and does not even inform us whether it is making progress in\r\nspace. Even if it is so making progress, its orbit of revolution may\r\nremain the same. But it may be said the reproduction of the species is\r\nnot in a circle but in a spiral. Within the limit of experience it is\r\nnot so, since, however it may undulate, it always returns into itself.\r\nBut supposing it to be a spiral, it may ascend or descend, or expand\r\nand contract; but this does not connect it with other similar spirals,\r\nthe separate origin of which is to be separately accounted for.\r\n\r\nI have quoted the latter part of the passage because it is\r\ncharacteristic of evolutionists to decry the intelligence of those who\r\ndiffer from them. Now it is fair to admit that it requires some\r\nintelligence and some knowledge of nature to produce or even to\r\nunderstand such analogies as those of Mr. Spencer and his followers,\r\nbut it is no less true that a deeper insight into the study of nature\r\nmay not only enable us to understand these analogies, but to detect\r\ntheir fallacies. I am sorry to say, however, that at present the\r\nhypothesis of evolution is giving so strong a colouring to much of\r\npopular and even academic teaching, more especially in the easy and\r\nflippant conversion of the facts of embryology into instances of\r\nevolution on the plan of the above extract, that the Spencerians may\r\nnot long have to complain of want of faith and appreciation on the\r\npart of the improved apes whom they are kind enough to instruct as to\r\ntheir lowly origin.\r\n\r\nThe mention of \"appropriate conditions\" in the above extract reminds\r\nme of another fatal objection to evolution which its advocates\r\ncontinually overlook. An animal or plant advancing from maturity to\r\nthe adult state is in every stage of its progress a complete and\r\nsymmetrical organism, correlated in all its parts and adapted to\r\nsurrounding conditions. Suppose it to become modified in any way, to\r\never so small an extent, the whole of these relations are disturbed.\r\nIf the modification is internal and spontaneous, there is no guarantee\r\nthat it will suit the vastly numerous external agencies to which the\r\ncreature is subjected. If it is produced by agencies from without,\r\nthere is no guarantee that it will accord with the internal relations\r\nof the parts modified. The probabilities are incalculably great\r\nagainst the occurrence of many such disturbances without the breaking\r\nup altogether of the nice adjustment of parts and conditions. This is\r\nno doubt one reason of the extinction of so many species in geological\r\ntime, and also of the strong tendency of every species to spring back\r\nto its normal condition when in any way artificially caused to vary.\r\nIt is also connected with the otherwise mysterious law of the constant\r\ntransmission of all the characters of the parent.\r\n\r\nSpencer and Darwin occasionally see this difficulty, though they\r\nhabitually neglect it in their reasonings. Spencer even tries to turn\r\none part of it to account as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Suppose the head of a mammal to become very much more weighty--what\r\nmust be the indirect results? The muscles of the neck are put to\r\ngreater exertions; and the vertebræ have to bear additional tensions\r\nand pressures caused both by the increased weight of the head and the\r\nstronger contraction of muscles that support and move the head.\" He\r\ngoes on to say that the processes of the vertebrae will have augmented\r\nstrains put upon them, the thoracic region and fore limbs will have to\r\nbe enlarged, and even the hind limbs may require modification to\r\nfacilitate locomotion. He concludes: \"Any one who compares the outline\r\nof the bison with that of its congener, the ox, will clearly see how\r\nprofoundly a heavier head affects the entire osseous and muscular\r\nsystem.\"\r\n\r\nWe need not stop to mention the usual inaccuracies as to facts in this\r\nparagraph, as, for example, the support of the head being attributed\r\nto muscles alone, without reference to the strong elastic ligament of\r\nthe neck. We may first notice the assumption that an animal can\r\nacquire a head \"very much more weighty\" then that which it had before,\r\na very improbable supposition, whether as a monstrous birth Dr as an\r\neffect of external conditions after birth. But suppose this to have\r\noccurred, and what is even less likely, that the very much heavier\r\nhead is an advantage in some way, what guarantee can evolution give\r\nus that the number of other modifications required would take place\r\nsimultaneously with this acquisition! It would be easy to show that\r\nthis would depend on the concurrence of hundreds of other conditions\r\nwithin and without the animal, all of which must co-operate to produce\r\nthe desired effect, if indeed they could produce this effect even by\r\ntheir conjoint action, a power which the writer, it will be observed,\r\nquietly assumes, as well as the probability of the initial change in\r\nthe head. Finally, the naivete with which it is assumed that the bison\r\nand the ox are examples of such an evolution, would be refreshing in\r\nthese artificial days, if instances of it did not occur in almost\r\nevery page of the writings of evolutionists.\r\n\r\nIt would only weary the reader to follow evolution any further into\r\ndetails, especially as my object in this chapter is to show that\r\ngenerally, and as a theory of nature and of man, it has no good\r\nfoundation; but we should not leave the subject without noting\r\nprecisely the derivation of man according to this theory; and for this\r\npurpose I may quote Darwin's summary of his conclusions on the\r\nsubject.[BC]\r\n\r\n[BC] \"Descent of Man,\" part ii., ch. 21.\r\n\r\n\"Man,\" says Mr. Darwin, \"is descended from a hairy quadruped,\r\nfurnished with a tail and pointed ears, probably arboreal in its\r\nhabits, and an inhabitant of the Old World. This creature, if its\r\nwhole structure had been examined by a naturalist, would have been\r\nclassed amongst the quadrumana, as surely as would the common, and\r\nstill more ancient, progenitor of the Old and New World monkeys. The\r\nquadrumana and all the higher mammals are probably derived from an\r\nancient marsupial animal; and this, through a long line of diversified\r\nforms, either from some reptile-like or some amphibian-like creature,\r\nand this again from some fish-like animal. In the dim obscurity of the\r\npast we can see that the early progenitor of all the vertebrata must\r\nhave been an aquatic animal, provided with branchiæ, with the two\r\nsexes united in the same individual, and with the most important\r\norgans of the body (such as the brain and heart) imperfectly\r\ndeveloped. This animal seems to have been more like the larvæ of our\r\nexisting marine Ascidians then any other form known.\"\r\n\r\nThe author of this passage, in condescension to our weakness of faith,\r\ntakes us no further back then to an Ascidian, or \"sea-squirt,\" the\r\nresemblance, however, of which to a vertebrate animal is merely\r\nanalogical, and, though a very curious case of analogy, altogether\r\ntemporary and belonging to the young state of the creature, without\r\naffecting its adult state or its real affinities with other mollusks.\r\nIn order, however, to get the Ascidian itself, he must assume all the\r\n\"conditions\" already referred to in the previous part of this article,\r\nand fill most of the gaps. He has, however, in the \"Origin of Species\"\r\nand \"Descent of Man,\" attempted merely to fill one of the breaks in\r\nthe evolutionary series, that between distinct species, leaving us to\r\nreceive all the rest on mere faith. Even in respect to the question\r\nof species, in all the long chain between the Ascidian and the man, he\r\nhas not certainly established one link; and in the very last change,\r\nthat from the ape-like ancestor, he equally fails to satisfy us as to\r\nmatters so trivial as the loss of the hair, which, on the hypothesis,\r\nclothed the pre-human back, and on matters so weighty as the dawn of\r\nhuman reason and conscience.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that evolution as an hypothesis has no basis in experience\r\nor in scientific fact, and that its imagined series of transmutations\r\nhas breaks which cannot be filled. We have now to consider how it\r\nstands with the belief that man has been created by a higher power.\r\nAgainst this supposition the evolutionists try to create a prejudice\r\nin two ways. First, they maintain with Herbert Spencer that the\r\nhypothesis of creation is inconceivable, or, as they say,\r\n\"unthinkable;\" an assertion which, when examined, proves to mean only\r\nthat we do not know perfectly the details of such an operation, an\r\nobjection equally fatal to the origin either of matter or life, on the\r\nhypothesis of evolution. Secondly, they always refer to creation as if\r\nit must be a special miracle, in the sense of a contravention of or\r\ndeparture from ordinary natural laws; but this is an assumption\r\nutterly without proof, since creation may be as much according to law\r\nas evolution, though in either case the precise laws involved may be\r\nvery imperfectly known.\r\n\r\nHow absurd, they say, to imagine an animal created at once, fully\r\nformed, by a special miracle, instead of supposing it to be slowly\r\nelaborated through, countless ages of evolution. To Darwin the\r\ndoctrine of creation is but \"a curious illustration of the blindness\r\nof preconceived opinion.\" \"These authors,\" he says, \"seem no more\r\nstartled at a miraculous act of creation then at an ordinary birth;\r\nbut do they really believe that at innumerable periods in the earth's\r\nhistory, certain elemental atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash\r\ninto living tissues?\" Darwin, with all his philosophic fairness,\r\nsometimes becomes almost Spencerian in his looseness of expression;\r\nand in the above extract, the terms \"miraculous,\" \"innumerable,\"\r\n\"elemental atoms,\" \"suddenly,\" and \"flash,\" all express ideas in no\r\nrespect necessary to the work of creation. Those who have no faith in\r\nevolution as a cause of the production of species, may well ask in\r\nreturn how the evolutionist can prove that creation must be\r\ninstantaneous, that it must follow no law, that it must produce an\r\nanimal fully formed, that it must be miraculous. In short, it is a\r\nportion of the policy of evolutionists to endeavour to tie down their\r\nopponents to a purely gratuitous and ignorant view of creation, and\r\nthen to attack them in that position.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the actual statement of the theory of creation as it\r\nmay be held by a modern man of science? Simply this; that all things\r\nhave been produced by the Supreme Creative Will, acting either\r\ndirectly or through the agency of the forces and materials of His own\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nThis theory does not necessarily affirm that creation is miraculous,\r\nin the sense of being contrary to or subversive of law; law and order\r\nare as applicable to creation as to any other process. It does not\r\ncontradict the idea of successive creations. There is no necessity\r\nthat the process should be instantaneous and without progression. It\r\ndoes not imply that all kinds of creation are alike. There may be\r\nhigher and lower kinds. It does not exclude the idea of similarity or\r\ndissimilarity of plan and function as to the products of creation.\r\nDistinct products of creation may be either similar to each other in\r\ndifferent degrees, or dissimilar. It does not even exclude evolution\r\nor derivation to a certain extent: anything once created may, if\r\nsufficiently flexible and elastic, be evolved or involved in various\r\nways. Indeed, creation and derivation may, rightly understood, be\r\ncomplementary to each other. Created things, unless absolutely\r\nunchangeable, must be more or less modified by influences from within\r\nand from without, and derivation or evolution may account for certain\r\nsubordinate changes of things already made. Man, for example, may be a\r\nproduct of creation, yet his creation may have been in perfect harmony\r\nwith those laws of procedure which the Creator has set for His own\r\noperations. He may have been preceded by other creations of things\r\nmore or less similar or dissimilar. He may have been created by the\r\nsame processes with some or all of these, or by different means. His\r\nbody may have been created in one way, his soul in another. He may,\r\nnay, in all probability would be, part of a plan of which some parts\r\nwould approach very near to him in structure or functions. After his\r\ncreation, spontaneous culture and outward circumstances may have\r\nmoulded him into varieties, and given him many different kinds of\r\nspeech and of habits. These points are so obvious to common sense that\r\nit would be quite unnecessary to insist on them, were they not\r\nhabitually overlooked or misstated by evolutionists.\r\n\r\nThe creation hypothesis is also free from some of the difficulties of\r\nevolution. It avoids the absurdity of an eternal progression from the\r\nless to the more complex. It provides in will, the only source of\r\npower actually known to us by ordinary experience, an intelligible\r\norigin of nature. It does not require us to contradict experience by\r\nsupposing that there are no differences of kind or essence in things.\r\nIt does not require us to assume, contrary to experience, an\r\ninvariable tendency to differentiate and improve. It does not exact\r\nthe bridging over of all gaps which may be found between the several\r\ngrades of beings which exist or have existed.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, are so many men of science disposed to ignore altogether\r\nthis view of the matter? Mainly, I believe, because, from the training\r\nof many of them, they are absolutely ignorant of the subject, and from\r\ntheir habits of thought have come to regard physical force and the\r\nlaws regulating it as the one power in nature, and to relegate all\r\nspiritual powers or forces, or, as they have been taught to regard\r\nthem, \"supernatural\" things, to the domain of the \"unknowable.\"\r\nPerhaps some portion of the difficulty may be got over by abandoning\r\naltogether the word \"supernatural,\" which has been much misused, and\r\nby holding nature to represent the whole cosmos, and to include both\r\nthe _physical_ and the _spiritual_, both of them in the fullest sense\r\nsubject to law, but each to the law of its own special nature. I have\r\nread somewhere a story of some ignorant orientals who were induced to\r\nkeep a steam-engine supplied with water by the fiction that it\r\ncontained a terrible _djin_, or demon, who, if allowed to become\r\nthirsty, would break out and destroy them all. Had they been enabled\r\nto discard this superstition, and to understand the force of steam, we\r\ncan readily imagine that they would now suppose they knew the whole\r\ntruth, and might believe that any one who taught them that the engine\r\nwas a product of intelligent design, was only taking them back to the\r\nold doctrine of the thirsty demon of the boiler. This is, I think, at\r\npresent, the mental condition of many scientists with reference to\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nHere we come to the first demand which the doctrine of creation makes\r\non us by way of premises. In order that there may be creation there\r\nmust be a primary Self-existent Spirit, whose will is supreme. The\r\nevolutionist cannot refuse to admit this on as good ground as that on\r\nwhich we hesitate to receive the postulates of his faith. It is no\r\nreal objection to say that a God can be known to us only partially,\r\nand, with reference to His real essence, not at all; since, even if\r\nwe admit this, it is no more then can be said of matter and force.\r\n\r\nI am not about here to repeat any of the ordinary arguments for the\r\nexistence of a spiritual First Cause, and Creator of all things, but\r\nit may be proper to show that this assumption is not inconsistent with\r\nexperience, or with the facts and principles of modern science. The\r\nstatement which I would make on this point shall be in the words of a\r\nvery old writer, not so well known as he should be to many who talk\r\nvolubly enough about antagonisms between science and Christianity:\r\n\"that which is known of God is manifest in them (in men), for God\r\nmanifested it unto them. For since the creation of the world His\r\ninvisible things, even His eternal power and divinity are plainly\r\nseen, being perceived by means of things that are made.\"[BD] The\r\nstatement here is very precise. Certain things relating to God are\r\nmanifest within men's minds, and are proved by the evidence of His\r\nworks; these properties of God thus manifested being specially His\r\npower or control of all forces, and His divinity or possession of a\r\nnature higher then ours. The argument of the writer is that all\r\nheathens know this; and, as a matter of fact, I believe it must be\r\nadmitted even by those most sceptical on such points, that some notion\r\nof a divinity has been derived from nature by men of all nations and\r\ntribes, if we except, perhaps, a few enlightened positivists of this\r\nnineteenth century whom excess of light has made blind. \"If the light\r\nthat is in man be darkness, how great is that darkness.\" But then this\r\nnotion of a God is a very old and primitive one, and Spencer takes\r\ncare to inform us that \"first thoughts are either wholly out of\r\nharmony with things, or in very incomplete harmony with them,\" and\r\nconsequently that old beliefs and generally diffused notions are\r\npresumably wrong.\r\n\r\n[BD] Paul's Epistle to the Romans, chap i.\r\n\r\nIs it true, however, that the modern knowledge of nature tends to rob\r\nit of a spiritual First Cause? One can conceive such a tendency, if\r\nall our advances in knowledge had tended more and more to identify\r\nforce with matter in its grosser forms, and to remove more and more\r\nfrom our mental view those powers which are not material; but the very\r\nreverse of this is the case. Modern discovery has tended more and more\r\nto attach importance to certain universally diffused media which do\r\nnot seem to be subject to the laws of ordinary matter, and to prove at\r\nonce the Protean character and indestructibility of forces, the\r\naggregate of which, as acting in the universe, gives us our nearest\r\napproach to the conception of physical omnipotence. This is what so\r\nmany of our evolutionists mean when they indignantly disclaim\r\nmaterialism. They know that there is a boundless energy beyond mere\r\nmatter, and of which matter seems the sport and toy. Could they\r\nconceive of this energy as the expression of a personal will, they\r\nwould become theists.\r\n\r\nMan himself presents a microcosm of matter and force, raised to a\r\nhigher plane then that of the merely chemical and physical. In him we\r\nfind not merely that brain and nerve force which is common to him and\r\nlower animals, and which exhibits one of the most marvellous energies\r\nin nature, but we have the higher force of will and intellect,\r\nenabling him to read the secrets of nature, to seize and combine and\r\nutilize its laws like a god, and like a god to attain to the higher\r\ndiscernment of good and evil. Nay, more, this power which resides\r\nwithin man rules with omnipotent energy the material organism, driving\r\nits nerve forces until cells and fibres are worn out and destroyed,\r\ntaxing muscles and tendons till they break, impelling its slave the\r\nbody even to that which will bring injury and death itself. Surely,\r\nwhat we thus see in man must be the image and likeness of the Great\r\nSpirit. We can escape from this conclusion only by one or other of two\r\nassumptions, either of which is rather to be called a play upon words\r\nthen a scientific theory. We may, with a certain class of physicists\r\nand physiologists, confine our attention wholly to the fire and the\r\nsteam, and overlook the engineer. We may assume that with protoplasm\r\nand animal electricity, for example, we can dispense with life, and\r\nnot only with life but with spirit also. Yet he who regards vitality\r\nas an unmeaning word; and yet speaks of \"living protoplasm,\" and \"dead\r\nprotoplasm,\" and affirms that between these two states, so different\r\nin their phenomena, no chemical or physical difference exists, is\r\nsurely either laughing at us, or committing himself to what the Duke\r\nof Argyll calls a philosophical bull; and he who shows us that\r\nelectrical discharges are concerned in muscular contraction, has just\r\nas much proved that there is no need of life or spirit, as the\r\nelectrician who has explained the mysteries of the telegraph has shown\r\nthat there can be no need of an operator. Or we may, turning to the\r\nopposite extreme, trust to the metaphysical fallacy of those who\r\naffirm that neither matter, nor force, nor spirit, need concern them,\r\nfor that all are merely states of consciousness in ourselves. But what\r\nof the conscious self this self which thinks, and which is in relation\r\nwith surroundings which it did not create, and which presumably did\r\nnot create it? and what is the unknown third term which must have been\r\nthe means of setting up these relations? Here again our blind guides\r\ninvolve us in an absolute self-contradiction.\r\n\r\nThus we are thrown back on the grand old truth that man, heathen and\r\nsavage, or Christian and scientific, opens his eyes on nature and\r\nreads therein both the physical and the spiritual, and in connection\r\nwith both of these the power and divinity of an Almighty Creator. He\r\nmay at first have many wrong views both of God and of His works, but\r\nas he penetrates further into the laws of matter and mind, he attains\r\nmore just conceptions of their relations to the Great Centre and\r\nSource of all, and instead of being able to dispense with creation, he\r\nhopes to be able at length to understand its laws and methods. If\r\nunhappily he abandons this high ambition, and contents himself with\r\nmere matter and physical force, he cannot rise to the highest\r\ndevelopment either of science or philosophy.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be said that evolution may admit all this, and still\r\nbe held as a scientific doctrine in connection with a modified belief\r\nin creation. The work of actual creation may have been limited to a\r\nfew elementary types, and evolution may have done the rest.\r\nEvolutionists may still be theists. We have already seen that the\r\ndoctrine, as carried out to its logical consequences, excludes\r\ncreation and theism. It may, however, be shown that even in its more\r\nmodified forms, and when held by men who maintain that they are not\r\natheists, it is practically atheistic, because excluding the idea of\r\nplan and design, and resolving all things into the action of\r\nunintelligent forces. It is necessary to observe this, because it is\r\nthe half-way evolutionism which professes to have a Creator somewhere\r\nbehind it, that is most popular; though it is, if possible, more\r\nunphilosophical then that which professes to set out from absolute and\r\neternal nonentity, or from self-existent star-dust containing all the\r\npossibilities of the universe.\r\n\r\nAbsolute atheists recognise in Darwinism, for example, a philosophy\r\nwhich reduces all things to a \"gradual summation of innumerable minute\r\nand accidental material operations,\" and in this they are more logical\r\nthen those who seek to reconcile evolution with design. Huxley, in his\r\n\"lay sermons,\" referring to Paley's argument for design founded on the\r\nstructure of a watch, says that if the watch could be conceived to be\r\na product of a less perfect structure improved by natural selection,\r\nit would then appear to be the \"result of a method of trial and error\r\nworked by unintelligent agents, as likely as of the direct application\r\nof the means appropriate to that end, by an intelligent agent.\" This\r\nis a bold and true assertion of the actual relation of even this\r\nmodified evolution to rational and practical theism, which requires\r\nnot merely this God \"afar off,\" who has set the stone of nature\r\nrolling and then turned His back upon it, but a present God, whose\r\nwill is the law of nature, now as in times past. The evolutionist is\r\nreally in a position of absolute antagonism to the idea of creation,\r\neven when held with all due allowance for the variations of created\r\nthings within certain limits.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Paley's old illustration of the watch, as applied by Huxley,\r\nmay serve to show this as well as any other. If the imperfect watch,\r\nuseless as a time-keeper, is the work of the contriver, and the\r\nperfection of it is the result of unintelligent agents working\r\nfortuitously, then it is clear that creation and design have a small\r\nand evanescent share in the construction of the fabric of nature. But\r\nis it really so? Can we attribute the perfection of the watch to\r\n\"accidental material operations\" any more then the first effort to\r\nproduce such an instrument? Paley himself long ago met this view of\r\nthe case, but his argument may be extended by the admissions and pleas\r\nof the evolutionists themselves. For example, the watch is altogether\r\na mechanical thing, and this fact by no means implies that it could\r\nnot be made by an intelligent and spiritual designer, yet this\r\nassumption that physical laws exclude creation and design turns up in\r\nalmost every page of the evolutionists. Paley has well shown that if\r\nthe watch contained within itself machinery for making other watches,\r\nthis would not militate against his argument. It would be so if it\r\ncould be proved that a piece of metal had spontaneously produced an\r\nimperfect watch, and this a more perfect one, and so on; but this is\r\nprecisely what evolutionists still require to prove with respect both\r\nto the watch and to man. On the other hand it is no argument for the\r\nevolution of the watch that there may be different kinds of watches,\r\nsome more and others less perfect, and that ruder forms may have\r\npreceded the more perfect. This is perfectly compatible with creation\r\nand design. Evolutionists, however, generally fail to make this\r\ndistinction. Nor would it be any proof of the evolution of the watch\r\nto find that, as Spencer would say, it was in perfect harmony with its\r\nenvironment, as, for instance, that it kept time with the revolution\r\nof the earth, and contained contrivances to regulate its motion under\r\ndifferent temperatures, unless it could be shown that the earth's\r\nmotion and the changes of temperature had been efficient causes of the\r\nmotion and the adjustments of the watch; otherwise the argument would\r\nlook altogether in the direction of design. Nor would it be fair to\r\nshut up the argument of design to the idea that the watch must have\r\nsuddenly flashed into existence fully formed and in motion. It would\r\nbe quite as much a creation if slowly and laboriously made by the hand\r\nof the artificer, or if more rapidly struck off by machinery; and if\r\nthe latter, it would not follow that the machine which produced the\r\nwatch was at all like the watch itself. It might have been something\r\nvery different. Finally, when Spencer tries to cut at the root of the\r\nwhole of this argument, by affirming that man has no more right to\r\nreason from himself with regard to his Maker then a watch would have\r\nto reason from its own mechanical structure and affirm the like of its\r\nmaker, he signally fails. If the watch had such power of reasoning, it\r\nwould be more then mechanical, and would be intelligent like its\r\nmaker; and in any case, if thus reasoning it came to the conclusion\r\nthat it was a result of \"accidental material operations,\" it would be\r\naltogether mistaken. Nor would it be nearer the truth if it held that\r\nit was a product of spontaneous evolution from an imperfect and\r\ncomparatively useless watch that had been made millions of years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nWe have taken this illustration of the watch merely as given to us by\r\nHuxley, and without in the least seeking to overlook the distinction\r\nbetween a dead machine and a living organism; but the argument for\r\ncreation and design is quite as strong in the case of the latter, so\r\nlong as it cannot be proved by actual facts to be a product of\r\nderivation from a distinct species. This has not been proved either in\r\nthe care of man or any other species; and so long as it has not, the\r\ntheory of creation and design is infinitely more rational and\r\nscientific then that of evolution in any of its forms.\r\n\r\nBut all this does not relieve us from the question, How can species be\r\ncreated?--the same question put to Paul by the sceptics of the first\r\ncentury with reference to the resurrection--\"How are the dead raised,\r\nand with what bodies do they come?\" I do not wish to evade this\r\nquestion, whether applied to man or to a microscopic animalcule, and I\r\nwould answer it with the following statements:--\r\n\r\n1. The advocate of creation is in this matter in no worse position\r\nthen the evolutionist. This we have already shown, and I may refer\r\nhere to the fact that Darwin himself assumes at least one primitive\r\nform of animal and plant life, and he is confessedly just as little\r\nable to imagine this one act of creation as any other that may be\r\ndemanded of him.\r\n\r\n2. We are not bound to believe that all groups of individual animals,\r\nwhich naturalists may call species, have been separate products of\r\ncreation. Man himself has by some naturalists been divided into\r\nseveral species; but we may well be content to believe the creation of\r\none primitive form, and the production of existing races by variation.\r\nEvery zoologist and botanist who has studied any group of animals or\r\nplants with care, knows that there are numerous related forms passing\r\ninto each other, which some naturalists might consider to be distinct\r\nspecies, but which it is certainly not necessary to regard as\r\ndistinct products of creation. Every species is more or less\r\nvariable, and this variability may be developed by different causes.\r\nIndividuals exposed to unfavourable conditions will be stunted and\r\ndepauperated; those in more favourable circumstances may be improved\r\nand enlarged. Important changes may thus take place without\r\ntransgressing the limits of the species, or preventing a return to its\r\ntypical forms; and the practice of confounding these more limited\r\nchanges with the wider structural and physiological differences which\r\nseparate true species is much to be deprecated. Animals which pass\r\nthrough metamorphoses, or which, are developed through the\r\ninstrumentality of intermediate forms or \"nurses\"[BE] are not only\r\nliable to be separated by mistake into distinct species, but they may,\r\ntinder certain circumstances, attain to a premature maturity, or may\r\nbe fixed for a time or permanently in an immature condition. Further,\r\nspecies, like individuals, probably have their infancy, maturity, and\r\ndecay in geological time, and may present differences in these several\r\nstages. It is the remainder of true specific types left after all\r\nthese sources of error are removed, that creation has to account for;\r\nand to arrive at this remainder, and to ascertain its nature and\r\namount, will require a vast expenditure of skilful and conscientious\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n[BE] Mr. Mungo Ponton, in his book \"The Beginning,\" has based a theory\r\nof derivation on this peculiarity.\r\n\r\n3. Since animals and plants have been introduced upon our earth in\r\nlong succession throughout geologic time, and this in a somewhat\r\nregular manner, we have a right to assume that their introduction has\r\nbeen in accordance with a law or plan of creation, and that this may\r\nhave included the co-operation of many efficient causes, and may have\r\ndiffered in its application to different cases. This is a very old\r\ndoctrine of theology, for it appears in the early chapters of Genesis.\r\nThere the first aquatic animals, and man, are said to have been\r\n\"created;\" plants are said to have been \"brought forth by the land;\"\r\nthe mammalia are said to have been \"made.\" In the more detailed\r\naccount of the introduction of man in the second chapter of the same\r\nbook, he is said to have been \"formed of the dust of the ground;\" and\r\nin regard to his higher spiritual life, to have had this \"breathed\r\ninto\" him by God. These are very simple expressions, but they are very\r\nprecise and definite in the original, and they imply a diversity in\r\nthe creative work. Further, this is in accordance with the analogy of\r\nmodern science. How diverse are the modes of production and\r\ndevelopment of animals and plants, though all under one general law;\r\nand is it not likely that the modes of their first introduction on the\r\nearth were equally diverse?\r\n\r\n4. Our knowledge of the conditions of the origination of species, is\r\nso imperfect that we may possibly appear for some time to recede from,\r\nrather then to approach to, a solution of the question. In the infancy\r\nof chemistry, it was thought that chemical elements could be\r\ntransmuted into each other. The progress of knowledge removed this\r\nexplanation of their origin, and has as yet failed to substitute any\r\nother in its place. It may be the same with organic species. The\r\nattempt to account for them by derivation may prove fallacious, yet it\r\nmay be some time before we turn the corner, should this be possible,\r\nand enter the path which actually leads up to their origin.\r\n\r\nLastly, in these circumstances our wisest course is to take individual\r\nspecies, and to inquire as to their history in time, and the probable\r\nconditions of their introduction. Such investigations are now being\r\nmade by many quiet workers, whose labours are comparatively little\r\nknown, and many of whom are scarcely aware of the importance of what\r\nthey are doing toward a knowledge of, at least, the conditions of\r\ncreation, which is perhaps all that we can at present hope to reach.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter we shall try to sum up what is known as to man\r\nhimself, in the conditions of his first appearance on our earth, as\r\nmade known to us by scientific investigation, and explained on the\r\ntheory of creation as opposed to evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE MAN. CONSIDERED WITH REFERENCE TO MODERN THEORIES AS TO HIS\r\nORIGIN (continued).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapter we have seen that, on general grounds,\r\nevolution as applied to man is untenable; and that the theory of\r\ncreation is more rational and less liable to objection. We may now\r\nconsider how the geological and zoological conditions of man's advent\r\non the earth accord with evolution; and I think we shall find, as\r\nmight be expected, that they oppose great if not fatal difficulties to\r\nthis hypothesis.\r\n\r\nOne of the first and most important facts with reference to the\r\nappearance of man, is that he is a very recent animal, dating no\r\nfarther back in geological time then the Post-glacial period, at the\r\nclose of the Tertiary and beginning of the Modern era of geology.\r\nFurther, inasmuch as the oldest known remains of man occur along with\r\nthose of animals which still exist, and the majority of which are\r\nprobably not of older date, there is but slender probability that any\r\nmuch older human remains will ever be found. Now this has a bearing on\r\nthe question of the derivation of man, which, though it has not\r\naltogether escaped the attention of the evolutionists, has not met\r\nwith sufficient consideration.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the oldest; known human skull is that which has been termed\r\nthe \"Engis\" skull, from the cave of Engis, in Belgium. With reference\r\nto this skull, Professor Huxley has candidly admitted that it may have\r\nbelonged to an individual of one of the existing faces of men. I have\r\na cast of it on the same shelf with the skulls of some Algonquin\r\nIndians, from the aboriginal Hochelaga, which preceded Montreal; and\r\nany one acquainted with cranial characters would readily admit that\r\nthe ancient Belgian may very well have been an American Indian; while\r\non the other hand his head is not very dissimilar from that of some\r\nmodern European races. This Belgian man is believed to have lived\r\nbefore the mammoth and the cave bear had passed away, yet he does not\r\nbelong to an extinct species or even variety of man.\r\n\r\nFurther, as stated in a previous chapter, Pictet catalogues\r\nninety-eight species of mammals which inhabited Europe in the\r\nPost-glacial period. Of these fifty-seven still exist unchanged, and\r\nthe remainder have disappeared. Not one can be shown to have been\r\nmodified into a new form, though some of them have been obliged, by\r\nchanges of temperature and other conditions, to remove into distant\r\nand now widely separated regions. Further, it would seem that all the\r\nexisting European mammals extended back in geological time at least as\r\nfar as man, so that since the Post-glacial period no new species have\r\nbeen introduced in any way. Here we have a series of facts of the most\r\nprofound significance. Fifty-seven parallel lines of descent nave in\r\nEurope run on along with man, from the Post-glacial period, without\r\nchange or material modification of any kind. Some of them extend\r\nwithout change even farther back. Thus man and his companion-mammals\r\npresent a series of lines, not converging as if they pointed to some\r\ncommon progenitor, but strictly parallel to each other. In other\r\nwords, if they are derived forms, their point of derivation from a\r\ncommon type is pushed back infinitely in geological time. The absolute\r\nduration of the human species does not affect this argument. If man\r\nhas existed only six or seven thousand years, still at the beginning\r\nof his existence he was as distinct from lower animals as he is now,\r\nand shows no signs of gradation into other forms. If he has really\r\nendured since the great Glacial period, and is to be regarded as a\r\nspecies of a hundred thousand years' continuance, still the fact is\r\nthe same, and is, if possible, less favourable to derivation.\r\n\r\nSimilar facts meet us in other directions. I have for many years\r\noccupied a little of my leisure in collecting the numerous species of\r\nmolluscs and other marine animals existing in a sub-fossil state in\r\nthe Post-pliocene clays of Canada, and comparing them with their\r\nmodern successors. I do not know how long these animals have lived.\r\nSome of them certainly go far back into the Tertiary; and recent\r\ncomputations would place even the Glacial age at a distance from us of\r\nmore then a thousand centuries. Yet after carefully studying about two\r\nhundred species, and, of some of these, many hundreds of specimens, I\r\nhave arrived at the conclusion that they are absolutely unchanged.\r\nSome of them, it is true, are variable shells, presenting as many and\r\ngreat varieties as the human race itself; yet I find that in the\r\nPost-pliocene even the varieties of each species were the same as now,\r\nthough the great changes of temperature and elevation which have\r\noccurred, have removed many of them to distant places, and have made\r\nthem become locally extinct in regions over which they once spread.\r\nHere again we have an absolute refusal, on the part of all these\r\nanimals, to admit that they are derived, or have tended to sport into\r\nnew species. This is also, it is to be observed, altogether\r\nindependent of that imperfection of the geological record of which so\r\nmuch is made; since we have abundance of these shells in the\r\nPost-pliocene beds, and in the modern seas, and no one doubts their\r\ncontinued descent. To what does this point? Evidently to the\r\nconclusion that all these species show no indication of derivation, or\r\ntendency to improve, but move back in parallel lines to some unknown\r\ncreative origin.\r\n\r\nIf it be objected to this conclusion that absence of derivation in the\r\nPost-pliocene and Modern does not prove that it may not previously\r\nhave occurred, the answer is, that if the evolutionist admits that for\r\na very long period (and this the only one of which we have any certain\r\nknowledge, and the only one which concerns man) derivation has been\r\nsuspended, he in effect abandons his position. It may, however, be\r\nobjected that what I have above affirmed of species may be affirmed of\r\nvarieties, which are admitted to be derived. For example, it may be\r\nsaid that the negro variety of man has existed unchanged from the\r\nearliest historic times. It is carious that those who so often urge\r\nthis argument as an evidence of the great antiquity of man, and the\r\nslow development of races, do not see that it proves too much. If the\r\nnegro has been the same identical negro as far back as we can trace\r\nhim, then his origin must have been independent, and of the nature of\r\na creation, or else his duration as a negro must have been indefinite.\r\nWhat it does prove is a fact equally obvious from the study of\r\nPost-pliocene molluscs and other fossils, namely, that new species\r\ntend rapidly to vary to the utmost extent of their possible limits,\r\nand then to remain stationary for an indefinite time. Whether this\r\nresults from an innate yet limited power of expansion in the species,\r\nor from the relations between it and external influences, it is a fact\r\ninconsistent with the gradual evolution of new species. Hence we\r\nconclude that the recent origin of man, as revealed by geology, is, in\r\nconnection with the above facts, an absolute bar to the doctrine of\r\nderivation.\r\n\r\nA second datum furnished to this discussion by geology and zoology is\r\nthe negative one that no link of connection is known between man and\r\nany preceding animal. If we gather his bones and his implements from\r\nthe ancient gravel-beds and cave-earths, we do not find them\r\nassociated with any creature near of kin, nor do we find any such\r\ncreature in those rich Tertiary beds which have yielded so great\r\nharvests of mammalian bones. In the modern world we find nothing\r\nnearer to him then such anthropoid apes as the orangs and gorillas.\r\nBut the apes, however nearly allied, cannot be the ancestors of man.\r\nIf at all related to him by descent, they are his brethren or cousins,\r\nnot his parents; for they must, on the evolutionist hypothesis, be\r\nthemselves the terminal ends of distinct lines of derivation from\r\nprevious forms.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty is not removed by an appeal to the imperfection of the\r\ngeological record. So many animals contemporary with man are known,\r\nboth at the beginning of his geological history and in the present\r\nworld, that it would be more then marvellous if no very near relative\r\nhad ere this time been discovered at one extreme or the other, or at\r\nsome portion of the intervening ages. Further, all the animals\r\ncontemporary with man in the Post-glacial period, so far as is known,\r\nare in the same case. Discoveries of this kind may, however, still be\r\nmade, and we may give the evolutionist the benefit of the possibility.\r\nWe may affirm, however, that in order to gain a substratum of fact for\r\nhis doctrine, he must find somewhere in the later Tertiary period\r\nanimals much nearer to man then are the present anthropoid apes.\r\n\r\nThis demand I make advisedly--first, because the animals in question\r\nmust precede man in geological time; and secondly, because the apes,\r\neven if they preceded man, instead of being contemporary with him, are\r\nnot near enough to fulfil the required conditions. What is the actual\r\nfact with regard to these animals, so confidently affirmed to resemble\r\nsome not very remote ancestors of ours? Zoologically they are not\r\nvarieties of the same species with man they are not species of the\r\nsame genus, nor do they belong to genera of the same family, or even\r\nto families of the same order. These animals are at least ordinally\r\ndistinct from us in those grades of groups in which naturalists\r\narrange animals. I am well aware that an attempt has been made to\r\ngroup man, apes, and lemurs in one order of \"Primates,\" and thus to\r\nreduce their difference to the grade of the family; but as pat by its\r\nlatest and perhaps most able advocate, the attempt is a decided\r\nfailure. One has only to read the concluding chapter of Huxley's new\r\nbook on the anatomy of the vertebrates to be persuaded of this, more\r\nespecially if we can take into consideration, in addition to the many\r\ndifferences indicated, others which exist but are not mentioned by the\r\nauthor. Ordinal distinctions among animals are mainly dependent on\r\ngrade or rank, and are not to be broken down by obscure resemblances\r\nof internal anatomy, having no relation to this point, but to\r\nphysiological features of very secondary importance. Man must, on all\r\ngrounds, rank much higher above the apes then they can do above any\r\nother order of mammals. Even if we refuse to recognise all higher\r\ngrounds of classification, and condescend, with some great zoologists\r\nof our time, to regard nature with the eyes of mere anatomists, or in\r\nthe same way that a brick-layer's apprentice may be supposed to regard\r\ndistinctions of architectural styles, we can arrive at no other\r\nconclusion. Let us imagine an anatomist, himself neither a man nor a\r\nmonkey, but a being of some other grade, and altogether ignorant of\r\nthe higher ends and powers of our species, to contemplate merely the\r\nskeleton of a man and that of an ape. He must necessarily deduce\r\ntherefrom an ordinal distinction, even on the one ground of the\r\ncorrelations and modifications of structure implied in the erect\r\nposition. It would indeed be sufficient for this purpose to consider\r\nmerely the balancing of the skull on the neck, or the structure of the\r\nfoot, and the consequences fairly deducible from either of them. Nay,\r\nwere such imaginary anatomist a derivationist, and ignorant of the\r\ngeological date of his specimens, and as careless of the differences\r\nin respect to brain as some of his human _confrères_, he might,\r\nreferring to the loss specialised condition of man's teeth and foot,\r\nconclude, not that man is an improved ape, but that the ape is a\r\nspecialised and improved man. He would be obliged, however, even on\r\nthis hypothesis, to admit that there must be a host of missing links.\r\nNor would these be supplied by the study of the living races of men,\r\nbecause these want even specific distinctness, and differ from the\r\napes essentially in those points on which an ordinal distinction can\r\nbe fairly based.\r\n\r\nThis isolated position of man throughout the whole period of his\r\nhistory, grows in importance the more that it is studied, and can\r\nscarcely be the result of any accident of defective preservation of\r\nintermediate forms. In the meantime, when taken in connection with,\r\nthe fact previously stated, that man is equally isolated when he first\r\nappears on the stage, it deprives evolution, as applied to our\r\nspecies, of any precise scientific basis, whether zoological or\r\ngeological.\r\n\r\nI do not attach any importance whatever, in this connection, to the\r\nlikeness in type or plan between man and other mammals. Evolutionists\r\nare in the habit of taking for granted that this implies derivation,\r\nand of reasoning as if the fact that the human skeleton is constructed\r\non the same principles as that of an ape or a dog, must have some\r\nconnection with a common ancestry of these animals. This is, however,\r\nas is usual with them, begging the question. Creation, as well as\r\nevolution, admits of similarity of plan. When Stephenson constructed a\r\nlocomotive, he availed himself of the principles and of many of the\r\ncontrivances of previous engines; but this does not imply that he took\r\na mine-engine, or a marine-engine, and converted it into a\r\nrailroad-engine. Type or plan, whether in nature or art, may imply\r\nmerely a mental evolution of ideas in the maker, not a derivation of\r\none object from another.\r\n\r\nBut while man is related in his type of structure to the higher\r\nanimals, his contemporaries, it is undeniable that there are certain\r\npoints in which he constitutes a new type; and if this consideration\r\nwere properly weighed, I believe it would induce zoologists,\r\nnotwithstanding the proverbial humility of the true man of science, to\r\nconsider themselves much more widely separated from the brutes then\r\neven by the ordinal distinction above referred to. I would state this\r\nview of the matter thus:--It is in the lower animals a law that the\r\nbodily frame is provided with all necessary means of defence and\r\nattack, and with all necessary protection against external influences\r\nand assailants. In a very few cases, we have partial exceptions to\r\nthis. A hermit-crab, for instance, has the hinder part of its body\r\nunprotected; and has, instead of armour, the instinct of using the\r\ncast-off shells of molluscs; yet even this animal has the usual strong\r\nclaws of a crustacean, for defence in front. There are only a very few\r\nanimals in which instinct thus takes the place of physical\r\ncontrivances for defence or attack, and in these we find merely the\r\nusual unvarying instincts of the irrational animal. But in man, that\r\nwhich is the rare exception in all other animals, becomes the rule. He\r\nhas no means of escape from danger, compared with those enjoyed by\r\nother animals no defensive armour, no natural protection from cold or\r\nheat, no effective weapons for attacking other animals. These\r\ndisabilities would make him the most helpless of creatures, especially\r\nwhen taken in connection with his slow growth and long immaturity. His\r\nsafety and his dominion over other animals, are secured by entirely\r\nnew means, constituting a \"new departure\" in creation. Contrivance\r\nand inventive power, enabling him to utilise the objects and forces of\r\nnature, replace in him the material powers bestowed on lower animals.\r\nObviously the structure of the human being is related to this, and so\r\nrelated to it as to place man in a different category altogether from\r\nany other animal.\r\n\r\nThis consideration makes the derivation of man from brutes difficult\r\nto imagine. None of these latter appear even able to conceive or\r\nunderstand the modes of life and action of man. They do not need to\r\nattempt to emulate his powers, for they are themselves provided for in\r\na different manner. They have no progressive nature like that of man.\r\nTheir relations to things without are altogether limited to their\r\nstructures and instincts. Man's relations are limited only by his\r\npowers of knowing and understanding. How then is it possible to\r\nconceive of an animal which is, so to speak, a mere living machine,\r\nparting with the physical contrivances necessary to its existence, and\r\nassuming the new role of intelligence and free action?\r\n\r\nThis becomes still more striking if we adopt the view usually taken by\r\nevolutionists, that primitive man was a ferocious and carnivorous\r\ncreature, warring with and overcoming the powerful animals of the\r\nPost-glacial period, and contending with the rigours of a severe\r\nclimate. This could certainly not be inferred from his structure,\r\ninterpreted by that of the lower animals, which would inevitably lead\r\nto the conclusion that he must Lave been a harmless and frugivorous\r\ncreature, fitted to subsist only in the mildest climates, and where\r\nexempt from the attacks of the more powerful carnivorous animals. No\r\none reasoning on the purely physical constitution of man, could infer\r\nthat he might be a creature more powerful and ferocious then the lion\r\nor the tiger.\r\n\r\nIt is also worthy of mention that the existence of primitive man as a\r\nsavage hunter is, in another point of view, absolutely opposed to the\r\nDarwinian idea of his origin from a frugivorous ape. These creatures,\r\nwhile comparatively inoffensive, conform to the general law of lower\r\nanimals in having strong jaws and powerful canines for defence,\r\nhand-like feet to aid them in securing food, and escaping from their\r\nenemies, and hairy clothing to protect them from cold and heat. On the\r\nhypothesis of evolution we might conceive that if these creatures were\r\nplaced in some Eden of genial warmth, peace, and plenty, which\r\nrendered those appliances unnecessary, they might gradually lose these\r\nnow valuable structures, from want of necessity, to use them. But, on\r\nthe contrary, if such creatures were obliged to contend against\r\npowerful enemies, and to feed on flesh, all analogy would lead us to\r\nbelieve that they would become in their structures more like\r\ncarnivorous beasts then men. On the other hand, the anthropoid apes,\r\nin the circumstances in which we find them, are not only as\r\nunprogressive as other animals, but little fitted to extend their\r\nrange, and less gifted with the power of adapting themselves to new\r\nconditions then many other mammals less resembling man in external\r\nform.\r\n\r\nOn the Darwinian theory, such primitive men as geology reveals to us\r\nwould be more likely to have originated from bears then apes, and we\r\nwould be tempted to wish that man should become extinct, and that the\r\nchance should be given to the mild chimpanzee or orang to produce by\r\nnatural selection an improved and less ferocious humanity for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe only rational hypothesis of human origin in the present state of\r\nour knowledge of this subject is, that man must have been produced\r\nunder some circumstances in which animal food was not necessary to\r\nhim, in which he was exempt from the attacks of the more formidable\r\nanimals, and in less need of protection from the inclemency of the\r\nweather then is the case with any modern apes; and that his life as a\r\nhunter and warrior began after he had by his knowledge and skill\r\nsecured to himself the means of subduing nature by force and cunning.\r\nThis implies that man was from the first a rational being, capable of\r\nunderstanding nature, and it accords much more nearly with the old\r\nstory of Eden in the book of Genesis, then with any modern theories of\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nIt is due to Mr. Wallace--who, next to Darwin, has been a leader among\r\nEnglish derivationists--to state that he perceives this difficulty. As\r\na believer in natural selection, however, it presents itself to his\r\nmind in a peculiar form. He perceives that so soon as, by the process\r\nof evolution, man became a rational creature, and acquired his social\r\nsympathies, physical evolution must cease, and must be replaced by\r\ninvention, contrivance, and social organisation. This is at once\r\nobvious and undeniable, and it follows that the natural selection\r\napplicable to man, as man, must relate purely to his mental and moral\r\nimprovement. Wallace, however, fails to comprehend the full\r\nsignificance of this feature of the case. Given, a man destitute of\r\nclothing, he may never acquire such clothing by natural selection,\r\nbecause he will provide an artificial substitute. He will evolve not\r\ninto a hairy animal, but into a weaver and a tailor. Given, a man\r\ndestitute of claws and fangs, he will not acquire these, but will\r\nmanufacture weapons. But then, on the hypothesis of derivation, this\r\nis not what is given us as the raw material of man, but instead of\r\nthis a hairy ape. Admitting the power of natural selection, we might\r\nunderstand how this ape could become more hairy, or acquire more\r\nformidable weapons, as it became more exposed to cold, or more under\r\nthe necessity of using animal food; but that it should of itself leave\r\nthis natural line of development and enter on the entirely different\r\nline of mental progress is not conceivable, except as a result of\r\ncreative intervention.\r\n\r\nAbsolute materialists may make light of this difficulty, and may hold\r\nthat this would imply merely a change of brain; but even if we admit\r\nthis, they fail to show of what use such better brain would be to a\r\ncreature retaining the bodily form and instincts of the ape, or how\r\nsuch better brain could be acquired. But evolutionists are not\r\nnecessarily absolute materialists, and Darwin himself labours to show\r\nthat the reasoning self-conscious mind, and even the moral sentiments\r\nof man, might be evolved from rudiments of such powers, perceptible in\r\nthe lower animals. Here, however, he leaves the court of natural\r\nscience, properly so called, and summons us to appear before the\r\njudgment-seat of philosophy; and as naturalists are often bad mental\r\nphilosophers, and philosophers have often small knowledge of nature,\r\nsome advantage results, in the first instance, to the doubtful cause\r\nof evolution. Since, however, mental science makes much more of the\r\ndistinctions between the mind of man and the instinct of animals then\r\nnaturalists, accustomed to deal merely with the external organism, can\r\nbe expected to do, the derivationist, when his plea is fairly\r\nunderstood, is quite as certain to lose his cause as when tried by\r\ngeology and zoology. He might indeed be left to be dealt with by\r\nmental science on its own ground; and as our province is to look at\r\nthe matter from the standpoint of natural history, we might here close\r\nour inquiry. It may, however, be proper to give some slight notion of\r\nthe width of the gulf to be passed when we suppose the mechanical,\r\nunconscious, repetitive nature of the animal to pass over into the\r\ncondition of an intellectual and moral being.\r\n\r\nIf we take, as the most favourable case for the evolutionist, the most\r\nsagacious of the lower animals--the dog,--for example and compare it\r\nwith the least elevated condition of the human mind, as observed in\r\nthe child or the savage, we shall find that even here there is\r\nsomething more then that \"immense difference in degree\" which Darwin\r\nhimself admits. Making every allowance for similarities in external\r\nsense, in certain instinctive powers and appetites; and even in the\r\npower of comparison, and in certain passions and affections; and\r\nadmitting, though we cannot be quite certain of this, that in these\r\nman differs from animals only in degree; there remain other and more\r\nimportant differences, amounting to the possession, on the part of\r\nman, of powers not existing at all in animals. Of this kind are--first,\r\nthe faculty of reaching abstract and general truth, ind consequently\r\nof reasoning, in the proper sense of the term; secondly, in connection\r\nwith this, the power of indefinite increase in knowledge, and in\r\ndeductions therefrom leading to practical results; thirdly, the power\r\nof expressing thought in speech; fourthly, the power of arriving at\r\nideas of right and wrong, and thus becoming a responsible and free\r\nagent. Lastly, we have the conception of higher spiritual\r\nintelligence, of supreme power and divinity, and the consequent\r\nfeeling of religious obligation. These powers are evidently different\r\nin kind, rather then in degree, from those of the brute, and cannot be\r\nconceived to have arisen from the latter, more especially as one of\r\nthe distinctive characters of these is their purely cyclical,\r\nrepetitive, and unprogressive nature.\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock has, by a great accumulation of facts, or supposed\r\nfacts, bearing on the low mental condition of savages, endeavoured to\r\nbridge over this chasm. It is obvious, however, from his own data,\r\nthat the rudest savages are enabled to subsist only by the exercise of\r\nintellectual gifts far higher then those of animals; and that if these\r\ngifts were removed from them, they would inevitably perish. It is\r\nequally clear that even the lowest savages are moral agents; and that\r\nnot merely in their religious beliefs and conceptions of good and\r\nevil, but also in their moral degradation, they show capacities not\r\npossessed by the brutes. It is also true that most of these savages\r\nare quite as little likely to be specimens of primitive man as are the\r\nhigher races; and that many of them have fallen to so low a level as\r\nto be scarcely capable, of themselves, of rising to a condition of\r\nculture and civilisation. Thus they are more likely to be degraded\r\nraces, in \"the eddy and backwater of humanity\" then examples of the\r\nsources from whence it flowed. And here it must not be lost sight of,\r\nthat a being like man has capacities for degradation commensurate with\r\nhis capacities for improvement; and that at any point of his history\r\nwe may have to seek the analogues of primeval man, rather in the\r\naverage, then the extremes of the race.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject, it may be well to consider the fact, that\r\nthe occurrence of such a being as man in the last stages of the\r\nworld's history is, in itself, an argument for the existence of a\r\nSupreme Creator. Man is himself an image and likeness of God; and the\r\nfact that he can establish relations with nature around him, so as to\r\nunderstand and control its powers, implies either that he has been\r\nevolved as a soul of nature, by its own blind development, or that he\r\nhas originated in the action of a higher being related to man. The\r\nformer supposition has been above shown to be altogether improbable;\r\nso that we are necessarily thrown back upon the latter. We must thus\r\nregard man himself as the highest known work of a spiritual creator,\r\nand must infer that he rightly uses his reason when he infers from\r\nnature the power and divinity of God.\r\n\r\nThe last point that I think necessary to bring forward here, is the\r\ninformation which geology gives as to the locality of the introduction\r\nof man. There can be no hesitation in affirming that to the temperate\r\nregions of the old continent belongs the honour of being the cradle of\r\nhumanity. In these regions are the oldest historical monuments of our\r\nrace; here geology finds the most ancient remains of human beings;\r\nhere also seems to be the birthplace of the fauna and flora most\r\nuseful and congenial to man; and here he attains to his highest pitch\r\nof mental and physical development. This, it is true, by no means\r\naccords with the methods of the derivationists. On their theory we\r\nshould search for the origin of man rather in those regions where he\r\nis most depauperated and degraded, and where his struggles for\r\nexistence are most severe. But it is surely absurd to affirm of any\r\nspecies of animal or plant that it must have originated at the limits\r\nof its range, where it can scarcely exist at all. On the contrary,\r\ncommon sense as well as science requires us to believe that species\r\nmust have originated in those central parts of their distribution\r\nwhere they enjoy the most favourable circumstances, and must have\r\nextended themselves thence as far as external conditions would permit.\r\nOne of the most wretched varieties of the human race, and as near as\r\nany to the brutes, is that which inhabits Tierra del Fuego, a country\r\nwhich scarcely affords any of the means for the comfortable sustenance\r\nof man. Would it not be absolutely impossible that man should have\r\noriginated in such a country? Is it not certain, en the contrary, that\r\nthe Fuegian is merely a degraded variety of the aboriginal American\r\nrace? Precisely the same argument applies to the Austral negro and the\r\nHottentot. They are all naturally the most aberrant varieties of man,\r\nas being at the extreme range of his possible extension, and placed in\r\nconditions unfavourable, either because of unsuitable climatal or\r\norganic associations. It is true that the regions most favourable to\r\nthe anthropoid apes, and in which they may be presumed to have\r\noriginated, are by no means the most favourable to man; but this only\r\nmakes it the less likely that man could have been derived from such a\r\nparentage.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, the geological date of the appearance of man, the\r\nwant of any link of connection between him and any preceding animal,\r\nand his dissimilar bodily and mental constitution from any creatures\r\ncontemporary with him, render his derivation from apes or other\r\ninferior animals in the highest degree improbable, the locality of his\r\nprobable origin confirms this conclusion in the strongest manner. It\r\nalso shows that man and the higher apes are not likely to have\r\noriginated in the same regions, or under the same conditions, and that\r\nthe conditions of human origin are rather the coincidence of suitable\r\nclimatal and organic surroundings then the occurrence of animals\r\nclosely related in structure to man.\r\n\r\nChanges of conditions in geological time will not meet this\r\ndifficulty. They might lead to migrations, as they have done in the\r\ncase of both plants and animals, but not to anything further. The\r\nhyena, whose bones are found in the English caves, has been driven by\r\ngeological changes to South Africa, but he is still the same hyena.\r\nThe reindeer which once roamed in France is still the reindeer in\r\nLapland; and though under different geological conditions we might\r\nimagine the creature to have originated in the south of Europe, a\r\ncountry not now suitable to it, this would neither give reason to\r\nbelieve that any animal now living in the south of Europe was its\r\nprogenitor, nor to doubt that it still remains unchanged in its new\r\nhabitat. Indeed, the absence of anything more then merely varietal\r\nchange in man and his companion-animals, in consequence of the\r\ngeological changes and migrations of the Modern period, furnishes, as\r\nalready stated, a strong if not conclusive argument against\r\nderivation; which here, as elsewhere, only increases our actual\r\ndifficulties, while professing to extricate us from them.\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe arguments in the preceding pages cover only a small portion of the\r\nextensive field opened up by this subject. They relate, however, to\r\nsome of the prominent and important points, and I trust are sufficient\r\nto show that, as applied to man, the theory of derivation merely\r\ntrifles with the great question of his origin, without approaching to\r\nits solution. I may now, in conclusion, sketch the leading features of\r\nprimitive man, as he appears to us through the mist of the intervening\r\nages, and compare the picture with that presented by the oldest\r\nhistorical records of our race.\r\n\r\nTwo pictures of primeval man are in our time before the world. One\r\nrepresents him as the pure and happy inhabitant of an Eden, free from\r\nall the ills that have afflicted his descendants, and revelling in the\r\nbliss of a golden age. This is the representation of Holy Scripture,\r\nand it is also the dream of all the poetry and myth of the earlier\r\nages of the world. It is a beautiful picture, whether we regard it as\r\nfounded on historical fact, or derived from God Himself, or from the\r\nyearnings of the higher spiritual nature of man. The other picture is\r\na joint product of modern philosophy and of antiquarian research. It\r\npresents to us a coarse and filthy savage, repulsive in feature, gross\r\nin habits, warring with his fellow-savages, and warring yet more\r\nremorselessly with every living thing he could destroy, tearing\r\nhalf-cooked flesh, and cracking marrow-bones with stone hammers,\r\nsheltering himself in damp and smoky caves, with no eye heavenward,\r\nand with only the first rude beginnings of the most important arts of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBoth pictures may contain elements of truth, for man is a many-sided\r\nmonster, made up of things apparently incongruous, and presenting here\r\nand there features out of which either picture may be composed.\r\nEvolutionists, and especially those who believe in the struggle for\r\nexistence and natural selection, ignore altogether the evidence of the\r\ngolden age of humanity, and refer us to the rudest of modern savages\r\nas the types of primitive man. Those who believe in a Divine origin\r\nfor our race, perhaps dwell too much on the higher spiritual features\r\nof the Edenic state, to the exclusion of its more practical aspects,\r\nand its relations to the condition of the more barbarous races. Let us\r\nexamine more closely both representations; and first, that of\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nThe Glacial period, with its snows and ice, had passed away, and the\r\nworld rejoiced in a spring-time of renewed verdure and beauty. Many\r\ngreat and formidable beasts of the Tertiary time had disappeared in\r\nthe revolutions which had occurred, and the existing fauna of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere had been established on the land. Then it was that\r\nman was introduced by an act of creative power. In the preceding\r\nchanges a region of Western Asia had been prepared for his residence.\r\nIt was a table-land at the head waters of the rivers that flow into\r\nthe Euxine, the Caspian, and the Persian Gulf. Its climate was healthy\r\nand bracing, with enough of variety to secure vigour, and not so\r\ninclement as to exact any artificial provision for clothing or\r\nshelter. Its flora afforded abundance of edible fruits, and was rich\r\nin all the more beautiful forms of plant life; while its clear\r\nstreams, alluvial soil, and undulating surface, afforded every variety\r\nof station and all that is beautiful in scenery. It was not infested\r\nwith the more powerful and predacious quadrupeds, and its geographical\r\nrelations were such as to render this exemption permanent. In this\r\nparadise man found ample supplies of wholesome and nutritious food.\r\nHis requirements as to shelter were met by the leafy bowers he could\r\nweave. The streams of Eden afforded gold which he could fashion for\r\nuse and ornament, pearly shells for vessels, and agate for his few and\r\nsimple cutting instruments. He required no clothing, and knew of no\r\nuse for it. His body was the perfection and archetype of the\r\nvertebrate form, full of grace, vigour, and agility. His hands enabled\r\nhim to avail himself of all the products of nature for use and\r\npleasure, and to modify and adapt them according to his inclination.\r\nHis intelligence, along with his manual powers, allowed him to\r\nascertain the properties of things, to plan, invent, and apply in a\r\nmanner impossible to any other creature. His gift of speech enabled\r\nhim to imitate and reduce to systematic language the sounds of nature,\r\nand to connect them with the thoughts arising in his own mind, and\r\nthus to express their relations and significance. Above all, his Maker\r\nhad breathed into him a spiritual nature akin to His own, whereby he\r\nbecame different from all other animals, and the very shadow and\r\nlikeness of God; capable of rising to abstractions and general\r\nconceptions of truth and goodness, and of holding communion with his\r\nCreator. This was man Edenic, the man of the golden age, as sketched\r\nin the two short narratives of the earlier part of Genesis, which not\r\nonly conform to the general traditions of our race on the subject, but\r\nbear to any naturalist who will read them in their original dress,\r\ninternal evidence of being contemporary, or very nearly so, with the\r\nstate of things to which they relate.\r\n\r\n\"And God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and\r\nlet them rule over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air,\r\nand over the herbivora, and over all the land.' And God blessed them,\r\nand said unto them, 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and\r\nsubdue it.'\r\n\r\n\"And the Lord God formed the man of the dust of the ground, and\r\nbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living\r\nbeing. And the Lord God planted a garden, eastward in Eden, and there\r\nHe placed the man whom He had formed. And out of the ground made the\r\nLord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good\r\nfor food. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and\r\nparted from thence, becoming four heads (of great rivers). The name of\r\nthe first is Pison, compassing the whole land of Chavila, where there\r\nis gold, and the gold of that land is good; there is (also) pearl and\r\nagate.... And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden\r\nof Eden, to cultivate it and to take care of it.\"\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this most ancient and most beautiful history, we may\r\nsay that it implies several things of much importance to our\r\nconceptions of primeval man. It implies a centre of creation for man,\r\nand a group of companion animals and plants, and an intention to\r\ndispense in his case with any struggle for existence. It implies,\r\nalso, that man was not to be a lazy savage, but a care-taker and\r\nutiliser, by his mind and his bodily labour, of the things given to\r\nhim; and it also implies an intelligent submission on his part to his\r\nMaker, and spiritual appreciation of His plans and intentions. It\r\nfurther implies that man was, in process of time, from Eden, to\r\ncolonise the earth, and subdue its wildness, so as to extend the\r\nconditions of Eden widely over its surface. Lastly, a part of the\r\nrecord not quoted above, but necessary to the consistency of the\r\nstory, implies that, in virtue of his spiritual nature, and on certain\r\nconditions, man, though in bodily frame of the earth earthy, like the\r\nother animals, was to be exempted from the common law of mortality\r\nwhich had all along prevailed, and which continued to prevail, even\r\namong the animals of Eden. Further, if man fell from this condition\r\ninto that of the savage of the age of stone, it must have been by the\r\nobscuration of his spiritual nature under that which is merely\r\nanimal; in other words, by his ceasing to be spiritual and in\r\ncommunion with God, and becoming practically a sensual materialist.\r\nthat this actually happened is asserted by the Scriptural story, but\r\nits details would take us too far from our present subject. Let us now\r\nturn to the other picture--that presented by the theory of struggle for\r\nexistence and derivation from lower animals.\r\n\r\nIt introduces us first to an ape, akin perhaps to the modern orang or\r\ngorilla, but unknown to us as yet by any actual remains. This\r\ncreature, after living for an indefinite time in the rich forests of\r\nthe Miocene and earlier Pliocene periods, was at length subjected to\r\nthe gradually increasing rigours of the Glacial age. Its vegetable\r\nfood and its leafy shelter failed it, and it learned to nestle among\r\nsuch litter as it could collect in dens and caves, and to seize and\r\ndevour such weaker animals as it could overtake and master. At the\r\nsame time, its lower extremities, no longer used for climbing trees,\r\nbut for walking on the ground, gained in strength and size; its arms\r\ndiminished; and its development to maturity being delayed by the\r\nintensity of the struggle for existence, its brain enlarged, it became\r\nmore cunning and sagacious, and even learned to use weapons of wood or\r\nstone to destroy its victims. So it gradually grew into a fierce and\r\nterrible creature, \"neither beast nor human,\" combining the habits of\r\na bear and the agility of a monkey with some glimmerings of the\r\ncunning and resources of a savage.\r\n\r\nWhen the Glacial period passed away, our nameless simian man, or\r\nmanlike ape, might naturally be supposed to revert to its original\r\ncondition, and to establish itself as of old in the new forests of the\r\nModern period. For some unknown reason, however, perhaps because it\r\nhad gone too far in the path of improvement to be able to turn back,\r\nthis reversion did not take place. On the contrary, the ameliorated\r\ncircumstances and wider range of the new continents enabled it still\r\nfurther to improve. Ease and abundance perfected what struggle and\r\nprivation had begun; it added to the rude arts of the Glacial time; it\r\nparted with the shaggy hair now unnecessary; its features became\r\nsofter; and it returned in part to vegetable food. Language sprang up\r\nfrom the attempt to articulate natural sounds. Fire-making was\r\ninvented and new arts arose. At length the spiritual nature,\r\npotentially present in the creature, was awakened by some access of\r\nfear, or some grand and terrible physical phenomenon; the idea of a\r\nhigher intelligence was struck out, and the descendant of apes became\r\na superstitious and idolatrous savage. How much trouble and discussion\r\nwould have been saved, had he been aware of his humble origin, and\r\nnever entertained the vain imagination that he was a child of God,\r\nrather then a mere product of physical evolution! It is, indeed,\r\ncurious, that at this point evolutionism, like theism, has its \"fall\r\nof man;\" for surely the awakening of the religious sense, and of the\r\nknowledge of good and evil, must on that theory be so designated,\r\nsince it subverted in the case of man the previous regular operation\r\nof natural selection, and introduced all that debasing superstition,\r\npriestly domination, and religious controversy which have been among\r\nthe chief curses of our race, and which are doubly accursed if, as the\r\nevolutionist believes, they are not the ruins of something nobler and\r\nholier, but the mere gratuitous, vain, and useless imaginings of a\r\ncreature who should have been content to eat and drink and die,\r\nwithout hope or fear, like the brutes from which he sprang.\r\n\r\nThese are at present our alternative sketches: the genesis of theism,\r\nand the genesis of evolution. After the argument in previous pages, it\r\nis unnecessary here to discuss their relative degrees of probability.\r\nIf we believe in a personal spiritual Creator, the first becomes easy\r\nand natural, as it is also that which best accords with history and\r\ntradition. If, on the contrary, we reject all these, and accept as\r\nnatural laws the postulates of the evolutionists which we have already\r\ndiscussed, we may become believers in the latter. The only remaining\r\npoint is to inquire as to which explains best the actual facts of\r\nhumanity as we find them. This is a view of which much has been made\r\nby evolutionists, and it therefore merits consideration. But it is too\r\nextensive to be fully treated of here, and I must content myself with\r\na few illustrations of the failure of the theory of derivation to\r\nexplain some of the most important features presented by even the\r\nruder races of men.\r\n\r\nOne of these is the belief in a future state of existence beyond this\r\nlife. This belongs purely to the spiritual nature of man. It is not\r\ntaught by physical nature, yet its existence is probably universal,\r\nand it lies near the foundation of all religious beliefs. Lartet has\r\ndescribed to us the sepulchral cave of Aurignac, in which human\r\nskeletons, believed to be of Post-glacial date, were associated with\r\nremains of funeral feasts, and with indications of careful burial, and\r\nwith provisions laid up for the use of the dead. Lyell well remarks on\r\nthis, \"If we have here before us, at the northern base of the\r\nPyrenees, a sepulchral vault with skeletons of human beings, consigned\r\nby friends and relatives to their last resting-place if we have also\r\nat the portal of the tomb the relics of funeral feasts, and within it\r\nindications of viands destined for the use of the departed on their\r\nway to a land of spirits; while among the funeral gifts are weapons\r\nwherewith in other fields to chase the gigantic deer, the cave-lion,\r\nthe cave bear, and woolly rhinoceros--we have at last succeeded in\r\ntracing back the sacred rites of burial, and more interesting still, a\r\nbelief in a future state, to times long anterior to those of history\r\nand tradition. Rude and superstitious as may have been the savage of\r\nthat remote era, he still deserved, by cherishing hopes of a\r\nhereafter, the epithet of 'noble,' which Dryden gave to what he seems\r\nto have pictured to himself as the primitive condition of our\r\nrace.\"[BF]\r\n\r\n[BF] \"Antiquity of Man,\" p. 192\r\n\r\nIn like manner, in the vast American continent, all its long isolated\r\nand widely separated tribes, many of them in a state of lowest\r\nbarbarism, and without any external ritual of religious worship,\r\nbelieved in happy hunting-grounds in the spirit-land beyond the grave,\r\nand the dead warrior was buried with his most useful weapons and\r\nprecious ornaments.\r\n\r\n   \"Bring here the last gifts; and with them\r\n        The last lament be said.\r\n    Let all that pleased and yet may please,\r\n        Be buried with the dead\"\r\n\r\nwas no unmeaning funeral song, but involved the sacrifice of the most\r\nprecious and prized objects, that the loved one might enter the new\r\nand untried state provided for its needs. Even the babe, whose life is\r\nusually accounted of so small value by savage tribes, was buried by\r\nthe careful mother with precious strings of wampum, that had cost more\r\nmonths of patient labour then the days of its short life, that it\r\nmight purchase the fostering care of the inhabitants of that unknown\r\nyet surely believed-in region of immortality. This\r\n\r\n   \"--wish that of the living whole\r\n        No life may fail beyond the grave,\r\n        Derives it not from what we have\r\n    The likest God within the soul?\"\r\n\r\nIs it likely to have germinated in the brain of an ape? and if so, of\r\nwhat possible use would it be in the struggle of a merely physical\r\nexistence? Is it not rather the remnant of a better spiritual life--a\r\nremembrance of the tree of life that grew in the paradise of God, a\r\nlink of connection of the spiritual nature in man with, a higher\r\nDivine Spirit above? Life and immortality, it is true, were brought to\r\nlight by Jesus Christ, but they existed as beliefs more or less\r\nobscure from the first, and formed the basis for good and evil of the\r\nreligions of the world. Around this idea were gathered multitudes of\r\ncollateral beliefs and religious observances; feasts and festivals for\r\nthe dead; worship of dead heroes and ancestors; priestly intercessions\r\nand sacrifices for the dead; costly rites of sepulture. Vain and\r\nwithout foundation many of these have no doubt been, but they have\r\nformed a universal and costly testimony to an instinct of immortality,\r\ndimly glimmering even in the breast of the savage, and glowing with\r\nhigher brightness in the soul of the Christian, but separated by an\r\nimpassable gulf from anything derivable from a brute ancestry.\r\n\r\nThe theistic picture of primeval man is in harmony with the fact that\r\nmen, as a whole, are, and always have been, believers in God. The\r\nevolutionist picture is not. If man had from the first not merely a\r\nphysical and intellectual nature, but a spiritual nature as well, we\r\ncan understand how he came into relation with God, and how through all\r\nhis vagaries and corruptions he clings to this relation in one form or\r\nanother; but evolution affords no link of connection of this kind. It\r\nholds God to be unknowable even to the cultivated intellect of\r\nphilosophy, and perceives no use in ideas with relation to Him which,\r\naccording to it must necessarily be fallacious, It leaves the theistic\r\nnotions of mankind without explanation, and it will not serve its\r\npurpose to assert that some few and exceptional families of men have\r\nno notion of a God. Even admitting this, and it is at best very\r\ndoubtful, it can form but a trifling exception to a general truth.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that this view of the case is very clearly put in the\r\nBible, and it is curiously illustrated by a recent critique of \"Mr.\r\nDarwin's Critics,\" by Professor Huxley in the _Contemporary Review_. Mr.\r\nMivart, himself a derivationist, but differing in some points from\r\nDarwin, had affirmed, in the spirit rather of a Romish theologian then\r\nof a Biblical student or philosopher, that \"acts unaccompanied by\r\nmental acts of conscious will\" are \"absolutely destitute of the most\r\nincipient degree of goodness.\" Huxley well replies, \"It is to my\r\nunderstanding extremely hard to reconcile Mr. Mivart's dictum with\r\nthat noble summary of the whole duty of man, 'Thou shalt love the Lord\r\nthy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy\r\nstrength; and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.' According to\r\nMr. Mivart's definition, the man who loves God and his neighbour, and,\r\nout of sheer love and affection for both, does all he can to please\r\nthem, is nevertheless destitute of a particle of real goodness.\"\r\nHuxley's reply deserves to be pondered by certain moralists and\r\ntheologians whose doctrine savours of the leaven of the Pharisees, but\r\nneither Huxley nor his opponent see the higher truth that in the love\r\nof God we have a principle far nobler and more God-like and less\r\nanimal then that of mere duty. Man primeval, according to the doctrine\r\nof Genesis, was, by simple love and communion with his God, placed in\r\nthe position of a spiritual being, a member of a higher family then\r\nthat of the animal. The \"knowledge of good and evil\" which he acquired\r\nlater, and on which is based the law of conscious duty, was a less\r\nhappy attainment, which placed him on a lower level then that of the\r\nunconscious love and goodness of primal innocence. No doubt man's\r\nsense of right and wrong is something above the attainment of animals,\r\nand which could never have sprung from them; but still more is this\r\nthe case with his direct spiritual relation to God, which, whether it\r\nrises to the inspiration of the prophet or the piety of the Christian,\r\nor sinks to the rude superstition of the savage, can be no part of the\r\nAdam of the dust but only of the breath of life breathed into him from\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThat man should love his fellow-man may not seem strange. Certain\r\nsocial and gregarious and family instincts exist among the lower\r\nanimals, and Darwin very ably adduces these as akin to the similar\r\naffections of man; yet even in the law of love of our neighbour, as\r\nenforced by Christ's teaching, it is easy to see that we have\r\nsomething beyond animal nature. But this becomes still more distinct\r\nin the love of God. Man was the \"shadow and likeness of God,\" says the\r\nold record in Genesis--the shadow that clings to the substance and is\r\ninseparable from it, the likeness that represents it visibly to the\r\neyes of men, and of the animals that man rules over. Primeval man\r\ncould \"hear in the evening breeze the voice of God, walking to and fro\r\nin the garden.\" What mere animal ever had or could attain to such an\r\nexperience?\r\n\r\nBut if we turn from the Edenic picture of man in harmony with\r\nHeaven--\"owning a father, when he owned a God\"--to man as the slave of\r\nsuperstition; even in this terrible darkness of mistaken faith, of\r\nwhich it may be said,\r\n\r\n   \"Fear mates her devils, and weak faith her gods,\r\n    Gods partial, changeful, passionate, unjust,\r\n    Whose attributes are rage, revenge, or lust,\"\r\n\r\nwe see the ruins, at least, of that sublime love of God. The animal\r\nclings to its young with a natural affection, as great as that of a\r\nhuman mother for her child, but what animal ever thought of throwing\r\nits progeny into the Ganges, or into the fires of Moloch's altar, for\r\nthe saving of its soul, or to obtain the favour or avoid the wrath of\r\nGod? No less in the vagaries of fetichism, ritualism, and idolatry,\r\nand in the horrors of asceticism and human sacrifice, then in the\r\nEdenic communion with and hearing of God, or in the joy of Christian\r\nlove, do we see, in however ruined or degraded condition, the higher\r\nspiritual nature of man.\r\n\r\nThis point leads to another distinction which, when properly viewed,\r\nwidens the gap between man and the animals, or at least destroys one\r\nof the frail bridges of the evolutionists. Lubbock and others affect\r\nto believe that the lowest savages of the modern world must be nearest\r\nto the type of primeval man. I have already attempted to show the\r\nfallacy of this. I may add here that in so holding they overlook a\r\nfundamental distinction, well pointed out by the Duke of Argyll,\r\nbetween the capacity of acquiring knowledge and knowledge actually\r\nacquired, and between the possession of a higher rational nature and\r\nthe exercise of that nature in the pursuit of mechanical arts. In\r\nother words, primeval man must not be held to have been \"utterly\r\nbarbarous\" because he was ignorant of mining or navigation, or of\r\nsculpture and painting. He had in him the power to attain to these\r\nthings, but so long as he was not under necessity to exercise it, his\r\nmind may have expended its powers in other and happier channels. As\r\nwell might it be affirmed that a delicately nurtured lady is an \"utter\r\nbarbarian\" because she cannot build her own house, or make her own\r\nshoes. No doubt in such work she would be far more helpless then the\r\nwife of the rudest savage, yet she is not on that account to be held\r\nas an inferior being, or nearer to the animals. Our conception of an\r\nangelic nature implies the absence of all our social institutions and\r\nmechanical arts; but does this necessitate our regarding an angel as\r\nan \"utter barbarian\"? In short, the whole notion of civilisation held\r\nby Lubbock and those who think with him, is not only low and\r\ndegrading, but utterly and absurdly wrong; and of course it vitiates\r\nall their conceptions of primeval man as well as of man's future\r\ndestiny. Further, the theistic idea implies that man was, without\r\nexhausting toil, to regulate and control nature, to rule over the\r\nanimals, to cultivate the earth, to extend himself over it and subdue\r\nit; and all this as compatible with moral innocence, and at the same\r\ntime with high intellectual and spiritual activity.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a still nicer and more beautiful distinction\r\ninvolved in this, and included in the wonderful narrative in Genesis,\r\nso simple yet so much more profound then our philosophies; and which\r\ncrops out in the same discussion of the critics of Darwin, to which I\r\nhave already referred. A writer in the _Quarterly Review_ had attempted\r\nto distinguish human reason from the intelligence of animals, as\r\ninvolving self-consciousness and reflection in our sensations and\r\nperceptions. Huxley objects to this, instancing the mental action of a\r\ngreyhound when it sees and pursues a hare, as similar to that of the\r\ngamekeeper when he lets slip the hound.[BG]\r\n\r\n[BG] _Contemporary Review_, November, 1871, p. 461.\r\n\r\n\"As it is very necessary to keep up a clear distinction between these\r\ntwo processes, let the one be called neurosis and the other psychosis.\r\nWhen the gamekeeper was first trained to his work, every step in the\r\nprocess of neurosis was accompanied by a corresponding step in that of\r\npsychosis, or nearly so. He was conscious of seeing something,\r\nconscious of making sure it was a hare, conscious of desiring to catch\r\nit, and therefore to loose the greyhound at the right time, conscious\r\nof the acts by which he let the dog out of the leash. But with\r\npractice, though the various steps of the neurosis remain--for\r\notherwise the impression on the retina would not result in the loosing\r\nof the dog--the great majority of the steps of the psychosis vanish,\r\nand the loosing of the dog follows unconsciously, or, as we say,\r\nwithout thinking about, upon the sight of the hare. No one will deny\r\nthat the series of acts which originally intervened between the\r\nsensation and the letting go of the dog were, in the strictest sense,\r\nintellectual and rational operations. Do they cease to be so when the\r\nman ceases to be conscious of them? that depends upon what is the\r\nessence and what the accident of these operations, which taken\r\ntogether constitute ratiocination. Now, ratiocination is resolvable\r\ninto predication, and predication consists in marking, in some way,\r\nthe existence, the co-existence, the succession, the likeness and\r\nunlikeness, of things or their ideas. Whatever does this, reasons; and\r\nif a machine produces the effects of reason, I see no more ground for\r\ndenying to it the reasoning power because it is unconscious, then I\r\nsee for refusing to Mr. Babbage's engine the title of a calculating\r\nmachine on the same grounds.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have in the first place, the fact that an action, in the first\r\ninstance rational and complex, becomes by repetition simple and\r\ninstinctive. Does the man then sink to the level of the hound, or,\r\nwhat is more to the purpose, does this in the least approach to\r\nshowing that the hound can rise to the level of the man? Certainly\r\nnot; for the man is the conscious planner and originator of a course\r\nof action in which the instincts of the brute are made to take part,\r\nand in which the readiness that he attains by habit only enables him\r\nto dispense with certain processes of thought which were absolutely\r\nnecessary at first. The man and the beast co-operate, but they meet\r\neach other from entirely different planes; the former from that of the\r\nrational consideration of nature, the latter from that of the blind\r\npursuit of a mere physical instinct. The one, to use Mr. Huxley's\r\nsimile, is the conscious inventor of the calculating machine, the\r\nother is the machine itself, and, though the machine can calculate,\r\nthis fact is the farthest possible from giving it the power of growing\r\ninto or producing its own inventor. But Moses, or the more ancient\r\nauthority from whom he quotes in Genesis, knew this better then either\r\nof these modern combatants. His special distinctive mark of the\r\nsuperiority of man is that he was to have dominion over the earth and\r\nits animal inhabitants; and he represents this dominion as inaugurated\r\nby man's examining and naming the animals of Eden, and finding among\r\nthem no \"help meet\" for him.[BH] Man was to find in them helps, but\r\nhelps under his control, and that not the control of brute force, but\r\nof higher skill and of thought and even of love--a control still seen\r\nin some degree in the relation of man to his faithful companion, the\r\ndog. These old words of Genesis, simple though they are, place the\r\nrational superiority of man on a stable basis, and imply a distinction\r\nbetween him and the lower animals which cannot be shaken by the\r\nsophistries of the evolutionists.\r\n\r\n[BH] Literally, \"Corresponding,\" or \"Similar,\" to him.\r\n\r\nThe theistic picture further accords with the fact that the geological\r\ntime immediately preceding man's appearance was a time of decadence of\r\nmany of the grander forms of animal life, especially in that area of\r\nthe old continent where man was to appear. Whatever may be said of the\r\nimperfection of the geological record, there can be no question of the\r\nfact that the Miocene and earlier Pliocene were distinguished by the\r\nprevalence of grand and gigantic forms of mammalian life, some of\r\nwhich disappeared in or before the Glacial period, while others failed\r\nafter that period in the subsidence of the Post-glacial, or in\r\nconnection with its amelioration of climate. The Modern animals are\r\nalso, as explained above, a selection from the grander fauna of the\r\nPost-glacial period. To speak for the moment in Darwinian language,\r\nthere was for the time an evident tendency to promote the survival of\r\nthe fittest, not in mere physical development, but in intelligence and\r\nsagacity. A similar tendency existed even in the vegetable world,\r\nreplacing the flora of American aspect which had existed in the\r\nPliocene, with the richer and more useful flora of Europe and Western\r\nAsia. This not obscurely indicates the preparing of a place for man,\r\nand the removal out of his way of obstacles and hindrances. That these\r\nchanges had a relation to the advent of man, neither theist nor\r\nevolutionist can doubt, and it may be that we shall some day find that\r\nthis relation implies the existence of a creative law intelligible by\r\nus; but while we fail to perceive any link of direct causation between\r\nthe changes in the lower world, and the introduction of our race, we\r\ncannot help seeing that correlation which implies a far-reaching plan,\r\nand an intelligent design.\r\n\r\nFinally, the evolutionist picture wants some of the fairest lineaments\r\nof humanity, and cheats us with a semblance of man without the\r\nreality. Shave and paint your ape as you may, clothe him and set him\r\nup upon his feet, still he fails greatly of the \"human form divine;\"\r\nand so it is with him morally and spiritually as well. We have seen\r\nthat he wants the instinct of immortality, the love of God, the mental\r\nand spiritual power of exercising dominion over the earth. The very\r\nagency by which he is evolved is of itself subversive of all these\r\nhigher properties. The struggle for existence is essentially selfish,\r\nand therefore degrading. Even in the lower animals, it is a false\r\nassumption that its tendency is to elevate; for animals when driven to\r\nthe utmost verge of struggle for life, become depauperated and\r\ndegraded. The dog which spends its life in snarling contention with\r\nits fellow-curs for insufficient food, will not be a noble specimen\r\nof its race. God does not so treat His creatures. There is far more\r\ntruth to nature in the doctrine which represents him as listening to\r\nthe young ravens when they cry for food. But as applied to man, the\r\ntheory of the struggle for existence and survival of the fittest,\r\nthough the most popular phase of evolutionism at present, is nothing\r\nless then the basest and most horrible of superstitions. It makes man\r\nnot merely carnal, but devilish. It takes his lowest appetites and\r\npropensities, and makes them his God and creator. His higher\r\nsentiments and aspirations, his self-denying philanthropy, his\r\nenthusiasm for the good and true, all the struggles and sufferings of\r\nheroes and martyrs, not to speak of that self-sacrifice which is the\r\nfoundation of Christianity, are in the view of the evolutionist mere\r\nloss and waste, failure in the struggle of life. What does he give us\r\nin exchange? An endless pedigree of bestial ancestors, without one\r\ngleam of high or holy tradition to enliven the procession; and for the\r\nfuture, the prospect that the poor mass of protoplasm which\r\nconstitutes the sum of our being, and which is the sole gain of an\r\nindefinite struggle in the past, must soon be resolved again into\r\ninferior animals or dead matter. That men of thought and culture\r\nshould advocate such a philosophy, argues either a strange mental\r\nhallucination, or that the higher spiritual nature has been wholly\r\nquenched within them. It is one of the saddest of many sad spectacles\r\nthat our age presents. Still these men deserve credit for their bold\r\npursuit of truth, or what seems to them to be truth; and they are,\r\nafter all, nobler sinners then those who would practically lower us to\r\nthe level of beasts by their negation even of intellectual life, or\r\nwho would reduce us to apes, by making us the mere performers of rites\r\nand ceremonies, as a substitute for religion, or who would advise us\r\nto hand over reason and conscience to the despotic authority of\r\nfallible men dressed in strange garbs, and called by sacred names. The\r\nworld needs a philosophy and a Christianity of more robust mould,\r\nwhich shall recognise, as the Bible does, at once body and soul and\r\nspirit, at once the sovereignty of God and the liberty of man; and\r\nwhich shall bring out into practical operation the great truth that\r\nGod is a Spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit\r\nand in truth. Such a religion might walk in the sunlight of truth and\r\nfree discussion, hand in hand with science, education, liberty, and\r\nmaterial civilisation, and would speedily consign evolution to the\r\ntomb which has already received so many superstitions and false\r\nphilosophies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  Abbeville, Peat of, 294.\r\n  Acadian Group, 38.\r\n  Advent
