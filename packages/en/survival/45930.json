It is difficult to imagine anything less\r\nlively than an ordinary vegetable. They seem to us the very model\r\nof dullness, stupidity, and slowness; they cannot move even from\r\none field to the next; they are \"fast rooted in the soil\"; \"they\r\nlanguidly adjust their vapid vegetable loves\" like Tennyson's Oak.\r\n\r\nIn fact one usually speaks of vegetating when anybody is living a\r\nparticularly dull, unexciting kind of life in one particular place.\r\n\r\nAnd it even seems as if the books, which are supposed to give us the\r\nbest information about the study of plants, and which are not very\r\nattractive little books, quite agree with the ordinary views of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nFor one finds in them that plants differ from animals in being\r\n\"incapable of motion.\" This, of course, just means that an animal, or\r\nrather most animals, can walk, swim, or fly about, whilst plants have\r\nroots and do not move from one spot to another. But it is not true to\r\nsay that plants cannot move, for most plants grow, which means that\r\nthey move, and in some few cases, we find that plants behave very\r\nmuch in the same way as animals do when they are touched or excited\r\nin any way.\r\n\r\nWe shall have to speak about tendrils, roots, and insect-catching\r\nplants later on. But it is perhaps the Sensitive Plant which shows\r\nmost distinctly that it can shrink back or shrink together when it is\r\nbruised or roughly handled.\r\n\r\nIt will be described in its place, but just to show that this plant\r\ncan move of its own accord, it is only necessary to hold a lighted\r\nor burning match about an inch or so below the end of a long leaf.\r\nIf one does this then all the little leaflets begin to fold up, and\r\nfinally the main stalk droops; soon afterwards other leaves higher\r\nup the stalk begin to be affected in the same way, and fall limply\r\ndown one after the other. It is supposed that this movement frightens\r\na grazing animal, who will imagine there is something uncanny about\r\nthe plant and leave it alone. There are many respects in which this\r\nreaction of the Sensitive Plant resembles that found in animals. It\r\ndoes not take place if the plant is chloroformed or treated with\r\nether; the leaves also get \"fatigued\" if too often handled, and\r\nrefuse to rise up again.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, only a very few plants in which an immediate,\r\nvisible answer to a stimulus can be detected. But all plants are\r\nat work; they have periods of rest which correspond to our sleep,\r\nbut during their ordinary working hours they never slacken off, but\r\ncontinue vigorously active.\r\n\r\nThe life of man is so short that it is difficult to realize all\r\nthat is being done by the world of plants. It is necessary to get\r\nbeyond our human ideas of time. That is most conveniently done by\r\nconsidering how our plant world would strike an inhabitant of the\r\nplanet Neptune. Our theoretical Neptunian would be accustomed to a\r\nyear of 60,127 days (164 of our years); we will suppose that three of\r\nour years are a Neptunian week, and that ten of our days are about\r\nthree-quarters of a Neptunian hour, whilst two earth-hours would be a\r\nminute to him.\r\n\r\nIf such a being were to observe our earth, he would be astonished\r\nat the rapidity of our vegetable world. The buds would seem to him\r\nto swell visibly; in the course of an hour or two, the bare boughs\r\nof the trees would clothe themselves with the luxuriant greenery of\r\nmidsummer. Hops would fly round and round their poles, climbing at\r\nthe rate of a foot a minute. Bare places, such as the gravel heaps\r\nnear a sandpit, or the bare railroad tracks at a siding, would be\r\nperhaps in one week entirely covered by rich grass and wild flowers.\r\nIn six Neptunian months a forest of graceful larches would spring up\r\nto a height of seventy or eighty feet.\r\n\r\nSo that, if one thinks Neptunially, the activity of plants can be\r\neasily realized.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that we are so familiar with common annual events, such\r\nas the regular harvest every year, that we never seem to realize what\r\nit means. There are some 1,400,000,000 human beings on the earth\r\nto-day, and they entirely depend on the work done every year by\r\ncultivated and wild plants.\r\n\r\nEven in one of the least agricultural of all civilized countries,\r\nsuch as Great Britain, the cultivation of plants is still the largest\r\nnational industry. In 1897 we grew enough corn to give a ration of\r\n1lb. per diem to every inhabitant for 68 days, and we manage to get\r\na large amount from every acre (28 to 33 bushels per acre). In most\r\nother countries the relative importance of land and of agriculture\r\ngenerally is very much greater than it is in Britain.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it seems at first sight as if all this harvest had been\r\nmade out of nothing at all. Plants do take in a small amount of\r\nmineral matter from the earth, but these minerals form but a very\r\nlittle part of the bulk of a tree or any vegetable substance.\r\n\r\nA piece of wood can be burnt up in a fire and very little indeed of\r\nit is left. A few ashes will indeed remain, which are the minerals\r\ntaken in from the earth, but all the rest has vanished into the\r\natmosphere. The water which was contained in the wood has become\r\nsteam and is evaporated; the woody matter consisted chiefly of\r\ncompounds of a chemical substance, carbon, which also becomes an\r\ninvisible gas (carbonic acid gas) in a fire and goes back into the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nWhen the piece of wood was formed in a growing tree, it is easy to\r\nsee where the water came from: it was taken in by the roots. Just\r\nas flowers drink up the water in a vase, and wither if they do not\r\nreceive enough, so all plants suck up water by their roots. The\r\ncarbonic acid gas is taken into plants through their leaves and is\r\nworked up into sugar, starch, wood, and other matters inside the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nBut there is another very interesting point about the way in which\r\nwood is burnt in a fire; heat and light are obtained from a wood\r\nfire. Where did that heat and light come from?\r\n\r\nIf you walk in summer, under a tree in full leaf, it is much cooler\r\nthan it is in the sunshine outside. This shows what happens: the\r\nsunshine has been taken up or absorbed by the leaves of the tree. It\r\ndoes not pass through the foliage, but the heat and light are stopped\r\nby the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe light and heat which were used up by the leaves in making wood,\r\nsugar, and starch come back again when that wood or starch is burnt.\r\n\r\nSo that the burning up of a bit of wood is just the opposite to the\r\nformation of that wood in sunshine in a living tree. The important\r\npoint is that it is the sunshine which is used by plants to make\r\nall these refractory bodies, such as water, carbonic acid gas, and\r\nothers, unite together to form sugar, starch, and wood.\r\n\r\nAs the earth revolves upon its axis, sunlight falls successively on\r\nevery acre of land. Almost everywhere it is intercepted by green\r\nfoliage. Each leaf of every plant receives and absorbs as much as it\r\ncan, and, for so long as the light lasts, its living particles are\r\nhard at work: water or sap is hurrying up the stem and streaming out\r\nof the leaves as water vapour. Carbonic acid gas also is hurrying\r\ninto the leaves; inside these latter first sugar and then starch is\r\nbeing manufactured, so that the green cells become filled with starch\r\nor sugar.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the light fails, the work begins to slacken. When darkness\r\nsets in, the starch changes to sugar and passes down the leaf-stalk\r\ninto the stem, where it is used up in growth, in the formation of new\r\nwood or in supplying the developing flowers or young buds.\r\n\r\nNext morning when the sunlight touches the plant all its little\r\nliving cells set to work again, and another day's task is begun. It\r\nis very difficult to understand what is going on inside the leaf. If\r\nyou were to imagine a square yard of leaves all taking in sunshine\r\nand making starch as they do in fine weather; then if you weighed\r\nall these leaves, and then weighed them again one hour after they\r\nhad been in the sunshine, of course that square yard of leaf surface\r\nshould be heavier, because a certain amount of starch has been formed\r\nin it. The amount actually made in one hour has been estimated by\r\nDr. Horace Brown as 1/500 lb. So that 100 square yards of leaves\r\nworking in sunshine for five hours might make one pound of starch.\r\nBut one can estimate the activity of plants in another way. Look at\r\nthe amount of work done by the Grass, etc., on an acre of pasture\r\nland in one year. This might entirely support a cow and calf during\r\nthe summer; all the work done by these animals, as well as all the\r\nwork which can be done on the beef which they put on, is due to the\r\nactivity of the grasses on that acre. Moreover it is not only these\r\nlarge animals that are supported, but every mouse, every bird, every\r\ninsect, and every worm which lives on that piece of ground, derives\r\nall its energy from the activity of the plants thereon.\r\n\r\nAll work which we do with our brains or muscles involves the\r\nconsumption of food which has been formed by plants under the warm\r\nrays of the sun.\r\n\r\nSo that man's thoughts and labour, as well as that of every living\r\ncreature, is in the first instance rendered possible by sunshine.\r\n\r\nBut the sunlight, besides this all-important function, affects plants\r\nin other ways.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of the early spring flowers is the\r\nColtsfoot. On bare blackish and unsightly heaps of shale one may see\r\nquantities of its golden blossoms. Now if one looks at them on a\r\nfine sunny day, every single blossom will be widely opened and each\r\nwill turn towards the sun.\r\n\r\nIn wet cold weather every blossom will hang its head and be tightly\r\nclosed up. Exactly the same may be observed with the Dandelion, which\r\nis, indeed, still more sensitive than the Coltsfoot. In cold wet\r\nweather it is so tightly closed that it is barely possible to make\r\nout the yellow colour of the flower, but on warm sunny days it opens\r\nwide: every one of its florets drinks in as much as possible of the\r\ngenial sunshine. Both opening and closing are produced by the warmth\r\nand light of the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nIt is also the same with Pansies. On a fine day they spread out\r\nwidely, but in cold wet weather the heads hang over and the whole\r\nflower shrinks together.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting of them all are the little Woodsorrel\r\nand the Crocus.\r\n\r\nBoth are exceedingly sensitive to sunlight, or rather to the cold. A\r\nmere cloud passing over the sun on a fine spring morning will close\r\nup the flowers of the Crocus. In cold weather, if you bring one of\r\nits flowers indoors and put it near a bright light it will open\r\nwidely, sometimes in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nWhat produces these changes? It is very difficult to say, but every\r\nchange helps towards the general good of the plant. In warm sunny\r\nweather insects are flying about, and they can enter the flower if it\r\nis open. These insects help in setting the seed (as we shall see in\r\nanother chapter). In cold wet weather the flowers are best closed,\r\nas the rain might injure the florets and because also no insects are\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nBoth the Foxglove and the Blue Vetch (_Vicia Cracca_) are specially\r\ningenious in their way of obtaining light. For the stalk of every\r\nseparate blossom bends so that its head turns to the best lighted or\r\nsunniest side. Thus, if you have Foxgloves planted against a wall,\r\nevery flower will turn away from it; if you plant them in a circular\r\nbed, every one turns to the outside, so that every flower can get the\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has kept plants in a window knows that the stems turn\r\ntowards the light. This has the effect of placing the leaves where\r\nthey can get as much sunshine as possible. The leaves themselves are\r\nalso affected by sunlight. They seem to stretch out in such a way\r\nthat they absorb as much of it as they can.\r\n\r\nThat, of course, is what they ought to do, for they want to obtain\r\nas much as possible of the sunlight to carry on the work of forming\r\nsugar and starch inside the leaf.\r\n\r\nNot only each leaf by itself endeavours to place itself in the\r\nbest light-position, but all the leaves on the same spray of, for\r\ninstance, Elm, Lime, or Horsechestnut, arrange themselves so that\r\nthey interfere with one another as little as possible.[1] Very little\r\nlight is lost by escaping between the leaves, and very few of the\r\nleaves are overshaded by their neighbours on the same branch.\r\n\r\n  [1] Kerner, _Natural History of Plants_; also Scott Elliot,\r\n  _Nature Studies--Plant Life_.\r\n\r\nThus all co-operate in sunlight-catching. But, when a number of\r\ndifferent plants are competing together to catch the light on one\r\nsquare yard of ground, their leaves try to overreach and get beyond\r\ntheir neighbours.\r\n\r\nOn such a square yard of ground, it is just the competition amongst\r\nthe plants, that makes it certain that every gleam of light is used\r\nby one or other of them.\r\n\r\nEvery one of all those plants of itself alters the slope of its\r\nleaves and turns its stems so as to get as much light as possible.\r\n\r\nThis light, as we have seen, is taken in by the plant. It is used to\r\nmake the gas, carbonic acid,[2] unite with water: when these are made\r\nto join together, they form sugar; if the sugar is burnt the heat and\r\nlight appear again.\r\n\r\n  [2] The gas Carbonic acid consists of one part of Carbon and\r\n  two of Oxygen. It is invisible, just as are the gaseous states\r\n  of many liquids and solids. Water-vapour is not visible, though\r\n  water (liquid) and ice can of course be seen. Starch, sugar, cell\r\n  wall substance, etc., all contain Carbon, Oxygen, and Hydrogen.\r\n  Vegetable fat is not well understood, but starch helps to form it.\r\n\r\nBy changing the amount and arrangement of the molecules in sugar,\r\nstarch or vegetable fats, and many other substances can be formed.\r\nBut it is the sunlight that makes all this possible.\r\n\r\nThus the sun not merely supplies the motive power for all animal\r\nand vegetable activity but, by its influence, flowers, leaves, and\r\nstems move and turn in such ways that they are in the most convenient\r\nposition to intercept its light.\r\n\r\nThe sunlight, though all-important in the life of most plants, kills\r\nmany kinds of bacteria and bacilli which love the darkness. The\r\nwell-known radium rays are also destructive to bacteria, and hinder\r\nthe growth of certain fungi (Becquerel's rays have a similar effect).\r\nThe X-rays are not so well understood, but one can close the leaflets\r\nof the Sensitive Plant by means of them.\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid gas forms but a small proportion of the atmosphere\r\nwhich surrounds a growing plant. Yet there is no lack of it, for when\r\nthe leaf is at work forming sugar the particles of gas are rushing\r\ninto the leaf, and other particles come from elsewhere to take their\r\nplace. Every fire and every breath given off by an animal yields up\r\ncarbonic acid, so that it is constantly in circulation.\r\n\r\nThis is more easily seen by tracing the probable history of an atom\r\nof carbon. We will suppose that it enters a grass leaf as carbonic\r\nacid gas and becomes starch: next evening it will become sugar and\r\nmay pass from cell to cell up the stem to where the fruit or grain\r\nis ripening. It will be stored up as starch in the grain. This grass\r\nwill become hay and in due course be eaten by a bullock. The starch\r\nis changed and may be stored up in the fat of the animal's body. When\r\nthis is eaten at somebody's dinner, the fat will most probably be\r\nconsumed or broken up; this breaking up may be compared to a fire,\r\nfor heat is given off, and the heat in this case will keep up the\r\nbody-temperature of the person. The carbon atom will again become\r\ncarbonic acid gas, for it will take part of the oxygen breathed in,\r\nand be returned to the atmosphere as carbonic acid gas when the\r\nperson is breathing.\r\n\r\nAnother atom of carbon might enter the leaves of a tree: it will be\r\nsent down as sugar into the trunk and perhaps stored up as vegetable\r\nfat for the winter. Next spring the vegetable fat becomes starch and\r\nthen sugar: as sugar it will go to assist in forming woody material.\r\nIt may remain as wood for a very long time, possibly 150 to 200\r\nyears: then the tree falls and its wood begins to decay.\r\n\r\nThe bark begins to break and split because beetles and woodlice and\r\ncentipedes are burrowing between the bark and the wood. Soon a very\r\nminute spore of a fungus will somehow be carried inside the bark,\r\nvery likely sticking to the legs of a beetle. This will germinate\r\nand begin to give out dissolving ferments which, with the aid of\r\nbacteria, attack the wood. Our carbon atom is probably absorbed\r\ninto the fungus. Very soon the mushroom-like heads of this fungus\r\nbegin to swell and elongate; they burst through the bark and form a\r\nclump of reddish-yellow Paddock-stools. A fly comes to the fungus\r\nand lays an egg in it. This egg becomes a fat, unpleasant little\r\nmaggot which eats the fungus, and amongst others devours our carbon\r\natom, which again becomes fat in its body. Then a tomtit or other\r\nsmall bird comes along and eats the maggot. That bird stays out too\r\nlate one evening and is eaten by an owl. The owl, satisfied with a\r\ngood meal, allows itself to be surprised and shot by a keeper. When\r\nits body is nailed to a door and decays away, the carbon atom again\r\ntakes up oxygen and becomes carbonic acid gas, which escapes into the\r\natmosphere, and is ready for a fresh series of adventures.\r\n\r\nWe must now consider the water which with carbonic acid gas makes up\r\nsugar, etc. All plants contain a large percentage of water. This may\r\nbe as much as 95 to 98 per cent in water plants, and 50 to 70 per\r\ncent. in ordinary tissues; it is contained in every sort of vegetable\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nBut there is also a stream of water or sap which is almost always\r\nentering the roots, rising up the stem, and passing into the leaves.\r\nOn these leaves there are hundreds of minute openings called stomata,\r\nby which the water escapes as water-vapour into the atmosphere. A\r\nsingle oak leaf may have 2,000,000 of these stomata.\r\n\r\nIt is this current of sap which keeps the leaf fresh and vigorous; it\r\nis also by this current that every living cell is supplied with water\r\nand kept in a strong, healthy condition.\r\n\r\nThe amount of water used in this way is very great; in four months\r\nan acre of cabbages will transpire or give out through its leaves\r\n3,500,000 pints of water and an acre of hops from 5-1/2 to 7\r\nmillions. A single oak tree, supposed to have 700,000 leaves, must\r\napparently have given off into the atmosphere during five months\r\n230,000 lb. of water.\r\n\r\nSometimes the water is so abundant in the plant that it collects\r\nas drops on the tips of the leaves and falls off as fluid water. A\r\nvery young greenhouse plant (_Caladium nymphaefolium_) was found by\r\nMolisch to give off 190 water-drops a minute, and in one night it\r\nexuded one-seventeenth of a pint.\r\n\r\nThe water is found stored up in the stems or leaves of plants,\r\nespecially those of hot or dry climates. The Madagascar Traveller's\r\nTree, _Ravenala_, has a considerable amount of water in a hollow at\r\nthe base of its leaf, and it is possible to drink this water. The\r\nusual story is to the effect that a panting traveller finds this\r\npalm in the middle of the desert, and saves his life by quenching\r\nhis thirst with its crystal-clear water. Unfortunately the tree\r\nnever grows far from marshy ground or springs, and the water, which\r\nI tasted for curiosity, had an unpleasant vegetable taste, with\r\nreminiscences of bygone insect life.\r\n\r\nThese are, of course, exceptional cases; as a rule the tiny\r\nroot-hairs search and explore the soil; the sap or ascending current\r\npasses up the stem and pours out into the atmosphere. There the\r\nvapour is hurried off by winds, and eventually condenses and, falling\r\nas snow or rain on the earth, again sinks down into the soil.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to understand how the sap or water rises in the\r\ntrunks of tall trees; we know that along the path of the sap inside,\r\nthe root-hairs and other cells in the root, the various cells in\r\nthe stem, and finally those of the leaf, are all kept supplied and\r\ndistended or swollen out with water. All these living cells seem to\r\nhave the power of absorbing or sucking in water,[3] and eventually\r\nthey are so full and distended within, that the internal pressure\r\nbecomes almost incredible. Wieler found in the young wood of a Scotch\r\nfir that the pressure was sixteen atmospheres, or 240 lb. to the\r\nsquare inch. Dixon, when experimenting with leaf-cells, found ten,\r\ntwenty, or even thirty atmospheres (150 to 450 lb. to the square\r\ninch). No locomotive engine has cylinders strong enough to resist\r\nsuch internal pressures as these. It is an extraordinary fact, and\r\none almost incredible, that the cells can stand such pressures.\r\n\r\n  [3] The ascent is assisted by the osmotic absorption of water at\r\n  the root and by evaporation at the leaves.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & Underwood_\r\n    _London and New York_\r\n\r\n  A SENTINEL PALM IN THE ANDREAS CAÑON, CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n  This and such palms are often placed at the mouths of cañons to\r\n  indicate water, and may, indeed, thus save the lives of passing\r\n  travellers.]\r\n\r\nYet these minute living cells not only exist but work at this high\r\ntension, and, in some cases, they live to about fifty years.\r\n\r\nIn this favoured country of Great Britain, it is unusual to find any\r\nserious lack of water. But in Italy or Greece, every drop of it is\r\nvaluable and carefully husbanded.\r\n\r\nSometimes in such arid dry countries, a small spring of water\r\nwill form around itself a refreshing oasis of greenery surrounded\r\neverywhere by dreary thorn-scrub or monotonous sand. All the plants\r\nin such a spot have their own special work to do: the graceful trees\r\nwhich shade the spring, the green mosses on the stones, the fresh\r\ngrass and bright flowers or waving reeds, are all associated in a\r\ncommon work. They protect and shelter each other; their dead leaves\r\nare used to form soil; their roots explore and break up the ground.\r\nIt is true that they are competing with one another for water and for\r\nlight, but they are all forming a mutual protection, and producing an\r\nannual harvest.\r\n\r\nIn a climate like our own we cannot, like the Greek, suppose a Nymph\r\nin the shape of a lovely young woman watching over the spring, for\r\nshe would infallibly suffer from rheumatism and ague.\r\n\r\nBut every living cell in every plant in such an oasis depends upon\r\nthe water of the spring. All the plants there form an association\r\nwhich can be quite well compared to a city or some other association\r\nof human beings. They do compete, for they struggle to do the most\r\nwork for the good of the community, and they incidentally obtain\r\ntheir livelihood in the process.\r\n\r\nMost plant societies or associations such as those which cover Great\r\nBritain are not so obviously dependent on one particular spring, but\r\nthe plants composing them are associated in a very similar way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nON SAVAGES, DOCTORS, AND PLANTS\r\n\r\n   Savages knew Botany--First lady doctors and botanical\r\n   excursions--True drugs and horrible ornaments--Hydrophobia\r\n   cure--Cloves--Mustard--Ivy--Roses and Teeth--How to keep\r\n   hair on--How to know if a patient will recover--Curious\r\n   properties of a mushroom--The Scythian lamb--Quinine:\r\n   history and use--Safflower--Romance of ipecacuanha--Wars\r\n   of the spice trade--Cinnamon, dogwood, and indigo--Romance\r\n   of pepper--Babylonian and Egyptian botanists--Chinese\r\n   discoveries--Theophrastus--Medieval times--The first illustrated\r\n   book--Numbers of plants known--Discoveries of painters and poets.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we look back to the time when all men and women were mere savages,\r\nliving like the Esquimaux or the Australians of to-day, then it is\r\ncertain that every person was much interested in plants. Nothing was\r\nso interesting as daily food, because no one was ever certain of even\r\none good meal in the day.\r\n\r\nSo that in those early times there was a very sound, well-grounded\r\nknowledge of roots, bulbs, and fruits. They knew all that were good\r\nto eat, all that could possibly be eaten in time of famine and\r\nstarvation, and also every poisonous and unwholesome plant.\r\n\r\nSome savage genius must have discovered that certain plants were\r\n\"good medicine\"; that certain tree-barks helped to check fever, and\r\nthat others were worth trying when people had successfully devoured\r\nmore than they could comfortably digest. The life of a savage meant\r\ntremendous meals, followed by days of starvation; even now, when\r\nyoung children are fed on rice in India, a thread is tied round their\r\nwaist, and, when this bursts, they are not allowed to eat any more.\r\n\r\nVery probably some of these early physicians were lady doctors\r\nusually of a certain age. Men were too busy with their hunting\r\nand warfare to have time to try experiments with drugs, to make\r\nconcoctions of herbs all more or less disquieting and to find out if\r\nthese were of any use.\r\n\r\nSo that such medicine-men or witches gradually came to understand\r\nenough about poisons or fruits to make themselves respected and\r\neven feared. They would, no doubt, make botanical excursions in\r\nthe forest, accompanied by their pupils, in order to point out the\r\npoisonous and useful drugs.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting, in passing, that this habit of botanical\r\nprofessors going on excursions with medical students has persisted\r\ndown to our own times, probably without any break in the continuity.\r\n\r\nBut it was soon found advisable to make this knowledge secret and\r\ndifficult to get. They did not really know so very much, and a\r\nmysterious, solemn manner and a quantity of horrible and unusual\r\nobjects placed about the hut[4] would perhaps prevent some irate and\r\nimpatient savage patient from throwing a spear at his wizard--or\r\nwitch-doctor.\r\n\r\n  [4] This is still the custom in the huts of the wizard or\r\n  medicine-man in West Africa, where one finds small cushions stuck\r\n  over with all sorts of poisonous plants, bits of human bones, and\r\n  other loathsome accessories.\r\n\r\nShakespeare alludes to this in _Macbeth_. \"Scale of Dragon; tooth of\r\nwolf; witches' mummy; maw and gulf of the ravin'd salt sea shark;\r\nroot of hemlock digg'd i' the dark; ... gall of goat and slips of\r\nyew\"; and so on.\r\n\r\nMost of their cures were faith-cures, and they were, no doubt,\r\nmuch more likely to be successful when the patient believed he was\r\nbeing treated with some dreadful stew of all sorts of wonderful and\r\nhorrible materials.\r\n\r\nThis explains how it was that the knowledge of medicine became so\r\nmixed up with pure charlatanism and swindling that no man could tell\r\nwhich drugs were of real use and which were mere ornaments giving\r\npiquancy and flavour to the prescription. It is not possible to say\r\nthat a snake's head, the brain of a toad, the gall of a crocodile,\r\nand the whiskers of a tiger, were all of them absolutely useless.\r\nWithin the last few years it has been found that an antidote to\r\nsnake-bite can be obtained from a decoction of part of the snake\r\nitself, and it has also been discovered that small quantities of\r\nvirulent poisons are amongst our most valuable and powerful remedies.\r\n\r\nWhether the savages and their successors the doctors of feudal\r\ntimes even down to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, suspected\r\nor believed that this was the case must remain a rather doubtful\r\nhypothesis, but there is no question \"that the hair of the dog that\r\nbit him\" theory of medicine was very prevalent.\r\n\r\nThe following was a cure for hydrophobia of a more elaborate nature:\r\n\"I learned of a Friend who had tried it effectual to cure the Biting\r\nof a Mad Dog; take the Leaves and Roots of Cowslips, of the leaves of\r\nBox and Pennyroyal of each a like quantity; shred them small to put\r\nthem into Hot Broth and let it be so taken Three Days Together and\r\napply the herbs to the bitten place with Soap and Hog's suet melted\r\ntogether\" (Parkinson).\r\n\r\nThis prescription is not so preposterous as it sounds. Box and\r\nPennyroyal both contain essences which would be in all probability\r\nfatal to the germ of hydrophobia, and the soap and hog's suet would\r\nkeep air from the wound.\r\n\r\nOther prescriptions read like our modern patent medicines.\r\n\r\n\"Good Cloves comfort the Brain and the Virtue of Feeling, and help\r\nalso against Indigestion and Ache of the Stomach\" (Bartholomew).\r\n\r\n\"Senvey\" (the old name of mustard) \"healeth smiting of Serpents and\r\novercometh venom of the Scorpions and abateth Toothache and cleanseth\r\nthe Hair and letteth\" (that is, prevents or tends to prevent) \"the\r\nfalling thereof. If it be drunk fasting, it makes the Intellect good.\"\r\n\r\nEven in those days the people can scarcely have believed that\r\ndrinking mustard improved the intellect. Many of the remedies and\r\ncures are obviously false, for example the following:--\r\n\r\n\"A man crowned with Ivy cannot get drunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Powder of dry Roses comforteth wagging Teeth that be in point to\r\nfall.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that the surgeon was also a barber, and also a\r\n\"face-specialist,\" appears from the two following:--\r\n\r\n\"Leaves of Chestnut burnt to powder and tempered with Vinegar and\r\nlaid to a man's Head plaisterwise maketh Hair increase and keepeth\r\nhair from falling.\"\r\n\r\nThose whose hair turned grey could employ the following\r\nprescription:--\r\n\r\n\"Leaves of Mulberry sod in rainwater maketh black hair.\"\r\n\r\nIf a doctor was not quite sure of the endurance of a patient under\r\nthese heroic remedies, he could easily find out if he would recover,\r\nfor it was only necessary to try the following:--\r\n\r\n\"Celandine with the heart of a Mouldwarp\" (that is mole, _Scottice_\r\nmoudiewort) \"laid under the Heade of one that is grievouslie Sicke,\r\nif he be in danger of Death, immediately he will cry out with a loud\r\nvoice or sing; if not, he will weep.\"\r\n\r\nIn Lightfoot's _Flora Scotica_, there is an interesting account of\r\nthe Fly Mushroom (_Agaricus muscarius_) which is not very rare in\r\nBritain, and which may be easily recognized by the bright red top or\r\ncap, with whitish scales scattered over it, and a sort of ring of\r\nloose white tissue round the stalk.\r\n\r\n\"It has an acrid and deleterious quality. The inhabitants of\r\nKamschatka prepare a liquor from an infusion of this Agaric which\r\ntaken in a small quantity exhilarates the spirits, but in a larger\r\ndose brings on a trembling of the nerves, intoxication, delirium\r\nand melancholy. Linnæus informs us that flies are killed or at\r\nleast stupefied by an infusion of this fungus in milk and that\r\nthe expressed juice of it anointed on bedsteads and other places\r\neffectually destroys\"--what we may describe as certain lively and\r\npertinacious insects with a great affection for man!\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the fungus is said to be a deadly poison.[5]\r\n\r\n  [5] Cooke, _British Fungi_.\r\n\r\nThese quotations are enough to show how the real medical knowledge\r\nof those times was encrusted with all sorts of faith-curing devices,\r\nsheer falsehoods, and superstitions. The most learned men of the\r\nMiddle Ages were almost invariably monks and hermits, for there was\r\nnothing in the world of those strenuous times to attract a studious,\r\nsensitive disposition. The spirit of their learning can be judged\r\nfrom the wearisome disquisitions and lengthy volumes written about\r\nthe Barnacle Goose and Scythian Lamb.\r\n\r\nIn certain deserts along the Volga River in Russia, a peculiar\r\nfern may be found. It might be described as resembling a gigantic\r\nPolypody; the stem is about as thick as a lamb's body and grows\r\nhorizontally on the ground like that of the common fern mentioned;\r\nthick furry scales cover the outside of its stem, which ends at the\r\ntip in an elongated point. The blackish-green leaf-stalks springing\r\nfrom the furry stem end in large divided green leaves.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to some medieval humorist to cut off the upper part of\r\nthe leaf-stalks, and to make a sort of toy lamb out of the four\r\nleaf-stalk stumps and part of the woolly or furry stem.\r\n\r\nThis was palmed off as a wonderful curiosity of nature, as \"a plant\r\nthat became an animal,\" upon the ingenuous tourist of the period.\r\n\r\nSuch a subject was thoroughly congenial to the learned mind in the\r\nMiddle Ages, and an enormous quantity of literature was produced in\r\nconsequence. The general theory is given in the following lines:--\r\n\r\n    \"Cradled in snow and fanned by Arctic air,\r\n    Shines, gentle Barometz, thy golden hair,\r\n    Rooted in earth each cloven hoof descends,\r\n    And round and round her flexile neck she bends,\r\n    Crops the grey coralmoss and hoary thyme,\r\n    Or laps with rosy tongue the melting rime,\r\n    Eyes with mute tenderness her distant dam,\r\n    Or seems to bleat, a vegetable lamb.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the old idea of a well-known fern, _Cibotium barometz_.\r\n\r\nYet the original researches of some African \"Obi\" wizard or red\r\nIndian were not forgotten, and gradually came into practice.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE GARDEN OF EDEN\r\n\r\n  The title-page of John Parkinson's \"Paradisus.\" In the distance\r\n  may be seen a Scythian Lamb growing on its tree, and in the\r\n  foreground many plants are shown as well as Adam and Eve.]\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that these savages were true scientific\r\nexperimentalists, and made discoveries which have been of infinite\r\nservice to mankind. We remember great men like Harvey, Lister, and\r\nPasteur, but we never think of the Indian who discovered quinine.\r\n\r\nThe quinine trees, the yellow variety or _Calisaya cinchona_, grow\r\nin the mountains of north-eastern Bolivia and south-eastern Peru,\r\nin wild, inaccessible places at heights of 5000 to 6000 feet. The\r\nIndians probably experimented with almost every part of every\r\nwild tree before they discovered the wonderful properties of this\r\nparticular species. The quinine in nature is probably intended to\r\nprevent some fungus or small insect from attacking the bark: when\r\nquinine is used in malaria, it kills the fever germ which attacks\r\nthe blood corpuscles of the sick person, so that it is of the utmost\r\nimportance in all tropical countries.\r\n\r\nWhen the Jesuit fathers reached Peru and made friends and converts\r\nof the Indians, they discovered this remedy. Soon after the Countess\r\nde Chinchon, wife of the Viceroy of Peru, fell seriously ill of\r\nfever and was cured by the use of Jesuit's bark or quinine. It was\r\nintroduced into Europe about 1638, but for a very long time the\r\nentire supply came from South America. The British Indian government\r\nwere paying some £12,000 every year for South American quinine and,\r\nat the same time, the supply was running short, for the Indians were\r\ncutting down every tree.\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1859 (on the suggestion of Dr. Royle in 1839), the\r\nadventurous journeys of Clements Markham, Spruce, and Robert Cross\r\nresulted in the introduction of the Cinchona now flourishing in\r\nMadras, Bombay, and Ceylon. In 1897 British colonies produced about\r\n£43,415 worth of quinine, and the price is now only 7-1/2d. or 8d. a\r\npound!\r\n\r\nSuch drugs as Safflower are of very ancient date. It was commonly\r\nemployed in Egypt with other dyes and spices for embalming mummies.\r\nIt is now used with carbonate of soda and citric acid to give a pink\r\ndye to silks and satins, and occasionally, in the form of rouge, to\r\nladies' cheeks! How did the ancient Egyptians discover that this\r\nparticular thistle-like plant (_Carthamus tinctorius_) had flowers\r\nfrom which a red dye could be extracted by a tedious process of\r\nsoaking in water? The natural colour of the flowers is not red but\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nThe history of other drugs reads like a romance. Ipecacuanha, for\r\ninstance, was discovered by some unknown Indian who lived in the\r\ndamp tropical forests of Brazil and New Granada. A worthy merchant\r\nin Paris obtained a little of the drug in the way of trade. Shortly\r\nafterwards he became very ill and was attended by a certain Dr.\r\nHelvetius, who was exceedingly attentive to him. The grateful\r\nmerchant gave the kind-hearted physician some ipecacuanha. In the\r\ncourse of time the great King Louis XIV's son fell ill of dysentery,\r\nand Helvetius received 1000 louis d'or for his ipecacuanha.\r\n\r\nA very interesting and romantic history might be written about the\r\neffect of drugs, dyes, and spices in developing trade. During the\r\ntime when Britain was struggling to obtain a share of the foreign\r\ntrade of Holland and France, such spices as Clove, Cinnamon, and\r\nPepper were of the greatest importance. The Dutch, especially,\r\nadopted every possible method to keep the spice trade in their own\r\nhands. They cut down the clove, cinnamon, and other trees, in all\r\nthe islands not directly under their control. They imposed the most\r\nbarbarous penalties on any interloper. For instance, any one who sold\r\na single stick of cinnamon in Ceylon was punished with death. When\r\nthe English captured the island in 1796, all such restrictions were\r\nof course repealed. Nevertheless its cultivation remained a monopoly\r\nof the East India Company until 1832.\r\n\r\nLogwood (_Haematoxylon campechianum_) is closely connected with the\r\nstory of adventure and colonisation in the West Indies. Its use\r\nwas at first forbidden by Queen Elizabeth as it did not yield fast\r\ncolours; this was because the dyers of those times did not know of\r\nany mordant to fix them. Yet this is one of the few vegetable dyes\r\nwhich retain their position in the market in these days of aniline\r\ncolours, and it is said to be a large constituent, with brandy, of\r\ncheap \"port wine.\"\r\n\r\nIndigo was known to the Romans, who imported it from India on\r\ncamel-back by way of the Persian and Syrian desert. In the fifteenth\r\ncentury, when the Dutch began to introduce it in large quantities, it\r\nwas found to interfere with the \"woad\"[6] (_Isatis tinctoria_) which\r\nwas then a very important cultivated plant in Europe. In Nuremberg,\r\nan oath was administered once a year to all the manufacturers and\r\ndyers, by which they bound themselves not to use the \"devil's dye,\"\r\nas they called Indigo. Its more recent history shows a very different\r\nsystem. In Assam and other parts of British India, enormous sums of\r\nmoney have been invested in indigo plantations. It has been estimated\r\nthat four million pounds was invested, and that a population of\r\nsomething like 700 Europeans and 850 workmen to the square mile in\r\nBehar, were entirely supported by indigo plantations.\r\n\r\n  [6] The same \"woad\" which was used by the Britons to paint\r\n  themselves with.\r\nNow all these planters are ruined and the population is dispersed,\r\nbecause German indigo manufactured from coal-tar is destroying\r\nthe sale of the British-grown material. The plant has pretty blue\r\nflowers and belongs to the _Leguminous_ order. The dye is obtained by\r\nsteeping the leaves and young branches in water, and it is finally\r\nturned out in blue powder or cakes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting of all these drugs is Pepper. The\r\nDutch, in the days of Queen Elizabeth, had a monopoly of the East\r\nIndian trade, and they tried to cut down or burn all spice trees\r\nexcept those in their own control. They could thus form a corner in\r\npepper, and alter the price as they felt inclined. At one period they\r\ndoubled the price, raising it from three shillings to six shillings\r\nper pound. This annoyed the London merchants so much that they met\r\ntogether and formed the \"Society of Merchants and Adventurers trading\r\nto the East Indies.\" This was of course the original source of our\r\ngreat East Indian trade, and later on resulted in the Indian Empire.\r\n\r\nAt present, and for centuries past, the whole world is searched and\r\nexplored for drugs and spices. Our medicinal rhubarb for instance,\r\ngrows in China on the frontiers of Tibet; it is carried over the\r\nmountains of China to Kiaghta in Siberia, and from thence taken right\r\nacross Russian Siberia to London and New York. It is closely allied\r\nto the common or garden rhubarb, which grows wild on the banks of the\r\nVolga.\r\n\r\nIt is only our duty to remember with gratitude all those long since\r\ndeparted botanists who have made our life so full of luxury and have\r\nsupplied our doctors with all kinds of medicines.\r\n\r\nThe first doctors were of course just savage botanists, but as soon\r\nas men began to write down their experiences, we find botanical\r\ntreatises. The first, and for a very long time the only, botanical\r\nbooks were intended to teach medical students the names and how to\r\nrecognize useful flowers and drugs.\r\n\r\nMedicinal herbs such as mandrake, garlic, and mint are found\r\ndescribed on those clay cylinders which were used in Babylon instead\r\nof books, about 4000 B.C., that is some 6000 years ago! The Egyptians\r\nthought that \"kindly, healing plants,\" such as opium, almonds, figs,\r\ncastor-oil, dates, and olives, were derived from the \"blood and tears\r\nof the gods\"; that would be about 3000 B.C. It is not known how far\r\nback Chinese botany can be traced, but, by the twelfth century before\r\nChrist, some three hundred plants were known, including ginger,\r\nliquorice, rhubarb, and cinnamon.\r\n\r\nTheophrastus, who flourished about 300 B.C., was a scientific\r\nbotanist far ahead of his time. His notes about the mangroves in the\r\nPersian gulf are still of some importance. It is said that some two\r\nthousand botanical students attended his lectures.[7] It is doubtful\r\nif any professor of botany has ever since that time had so large a\r\nnumber of pupils. Dioscorides, who lived about 64 B.C., wrote a book\r\nwhich was copied by the Pliny (78 A.D.), who perished in the eruption\r\nof Vesuvius. The botany of the Middle Ages seems to have been mainly\r\nthat of Theophrastus and Dioscorides. In the tenth century we find\r\nan Arab, Ibn Sina, whose name has been commemorated in the name of a\r\nplant, Avicennia, publishing the first illustrated text-book, for he\r\ngave coloured diagrams to his pupils.\r\n\r\n  [7] Lascelles, _Pharm. Journ._, 23 May, 1903.\r\n\r\nAfter this there was exceedingly little discovery until comparatively\r\nrecent times.\r\n\r\nBut Grew in 1682 and Malpighi in 1700 began to work with the\r\nmicroscope, and with the work of Linnæus in 1731 modern botany was\r\nwell started and ready to develop.[8]\r\n\r\n  [8] Bonnier, _Cours de Botanique_.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare the numbers of plants known at various\r\nperiods, so as to see how greatly our knowledge has been increased of\r\nrecent years. Theophrastus (300 B.C.) knew about 500 plants. Pliny\r\n(78 A.D.) knew 1000 species by name. Linnæus in 1731 raised the\r\nnumber to 10,000. Saccardo in 1892 gives the number of plants then\r\nknown as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Flowering Plants                 105,231 species\r\n\r\n    Ferns                               2819    \"\r\n\r\n    Horsetails and Club-mosses           565    \"\r\n\r\n    Mosses                              4609    \"\r\n\r\n    Liverworts                          3041    \"\r\n\r\n    Lichens                             5600    \"\r\n\r\n    Fungi                             39,663    \"\r\n\r\n    Seaweeds                          12,178    \"\r\n                                     -------\r\n                                     173,706[9]\r\n\r\n  [9] Saccardo, _Atti d. Congresso, Bot. Intern. di Genova_, 1892.\r\n\r\nBut, during the years that have elapsed since 1892, many new species\r\nhave been described, so that we may estimate that at least 200,000\r\nspecies are now known to mankind.\r\n\r\nBut it is in the inner meaning and general knowledge of the life of\r\nplants that modern botany has made the most extraordinary progress.\r\nIt is true that we are still burdened with medieval terminology.\r\nThere are such names as \"galbulus,\" \"amphisarca,\" and \"inferior\r\ndrupaceous pseudocarps,\" but these are probably disappearing.\r\n\r\nThe great ideas that plants are living beings, that every detail in\r\ntheir structure has a meaning in their life, and that all plants\r\nare more or less distant cousins descended from a common ancestor,\r\nhave had extraordinary influence in overthrowing the unintelligent\r\npedantry so prevalent until 1875.\r\n\r\nYet there were many, not always botanists, of much older date, who\r\nmade great discoveries in the science. Leonardo da Vinci, the great\r\npainter, seems to have had quite a definite idea of the growth of\r\ntrees, for he found out that the annual rings on a tree-stem are\r\nthin on the northern and thick on the southern side of the trunk.\r\nDante[10] seems to have also understood the effect of sunlight in\r\nripening the vine and producing the growth of plants (_Purgatorio_,\r\nxxv. 77). Goethe seems to have been almost the first to understand\r\nhow leaves can be changed in appearance when they are intended to act\r\nin a different way. Petals, stamens, as well as some tendrils and\r\nspines, are all modified leaves. There is also a passage in Virgil,\r\nor perhaps more distinctly in Cato, which is held to show that the\r\nancients knew that the group of plants, _Leguminosæ_, in some way\r\nimproved the soil. I have also tried to show that Shelley had a more\r\nor less distinct idea of the \"warning\" or conspicuous colours (reds,\r\npurples, spotted, and speckled) which are characteristic of many\r\npoisonous plants (see p. 238).\r\n\r\n  [10]\r\n\r\n    \"Guarda il calor del sol che si fa vino\r\n    Giunto all' umor che dalla vite cola.\"\r\n\r\n  He is speaking of wine--that \"lovable blood,\" as he describes it.\r\n\r\nBut if we begin with the unlettered savage, one can trace the very\r\nslow and gradual growth of the science of plant-life persisting all\r\nthrough the Dark Ages, the Middle Ages, and recent times, until\r\nabout fifty or sixty years ago, when a sudden great development\r\nbegan, which gives us, we hope, the promise of still more wonderful\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nA TREE'S PERILOUS LIFE\r\n\r\n   Hemlock spruce and pine forests--Story of a pine seedling--Its\r\n   struggles and dangers--The gardener's boot--Turpentine of\r\n   pines--The giant sawfly--Bark beetles--Their effect on\r\n   music--Storm and strength of trees--Tall trees and long\r\n   seaweeds--Eucalyptus, big trees--Age of trees--Venerable\r\n   sequoias, oaks, chestnuts, and olives--Baobab and\r\n   Dragontree--Rabbits as woodcutters--Fire as protection--Sacred\r\n   fires--Dug-out and birch-bark canoes--Lake dwellings--Grazing\r\n   animals and forest destruction--First kind of cultivation--Old\r\n   forests in England and Scotland--Game preserving.\r\n\r\n    \"The murmuring pines and the hemlocks\r\n    Stand like harpers hoar with beards that rest on their\r\n      bosom.\"--_Longfellow._\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course the Hemlock here alluded to is not the \"hemlock rank\r\ngrowing on the weedy bank,\" which the cow is adjured not to eat in\r\nWordsworth's well-known lines. (If the animal had, however, obeyed\r\nthe poet's wishes and eaten \"mellow cowslips,\" it would probably have\r\nbeen seriously ill.) The \"Hemlock\" is the Hemlock spruce, a fine\r\nhandsome tree which is common in the forests of Eastern North America.\r\n\r\nThese primeval forests of Pine and Fir and Spruce have always taken\r\nthe fancy of poets. They are found covering craggy and almost\r\ninaccessible mountain valleys; even a tourist travelling by train\r\ncannot but be impressed by their sombre, gloomy monotony, by their\r\nobstinacy in growing on rocky precipices on the worst possible\r\nsoil, in spite of storm and snow.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Canadian Pacific Railway_\r\n\r\n  A GIANT DOUGLAS FIR\r\n\r\n  This species of fir tree grows to an enormous height in British\r\n  Columbia. It is now being planted in many Scotch forests.]\r\n\r\nBut to realize the romance of a Pine forest, it is necessary to\r\ntramp, as in Germany one sometimes has to do, for thirty miles\r\nthrough one unending black forest of Coniferous trees; there are no\r\ntowns, scarcely a village or a forester's hut. The ground is covered\r\nwith brown, dead needles, on which scarcely even green moss can\r\nmanage to live.\r\n\r\nThen one realizes the irritating monotony of the branches of Pines\r\nand Spruces, and their sombre, dark green foliage produces a morose\r\ndepression of spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Conifers are, amongst trees, like those hard-set, gloomy, and\r\ndetermined Northern races whose life is one long, continuous strain\r\nof incessant endeavour to keep alive under the most difficult\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nFrom its very earliest infancy a young Pine has a very hard time. The\r\nPine-cones remain on the tree for two years. The seeds inside are\r\nslowly maturing all this while, and the cone-scales are so welded\r\nor soldered together by resin and turpentine that no animal could\r\npossibly injure them. How thorough is the protection thus afforded to\r\nthe young seeds, can only be understood if one takes a one-year-old\r\nunopened cone of the Scotch Fir and tries to get them out. It does\r\nnot matter what is used; it may be a saw, a chisel, a hammer, or an\r\naxe: the little elastic, woody, turpentiny thing can only be split\r\nopen with an infinite amount of trouble and a serious loss of calm.\r\n\r\nWhen these two years have elapsed, the stalk of the cone grows so\r\nthat the scales are separated, and the seeds become rapidly dry and\r\nare carried away by the wind.\r\n\r\nThese seeds are most beautiful and exquisitely fashioned.\r\n\r\nThe seed itself is small and flattened. It contains both resin and\r\nfood material, and is enclosed in a tough leathery skin which is\r\ncarried out beyond the seed into a long, very thin, papery wing,\r\nwhich has very nearly the exact shape of the screw or propeller of a\r\nsteamer. This wing or screw is intended to give the seed as long a\r\nflight in the air as possible before it reaches the ground. If you\r\nwatch them falling from the tree, or throw one up into the air and\r\nobserve it attentively, you will see that it twirls or revolves round\r\nand round exactly like the screw of a steamship. It is difficult to\r\nexplain what happens without rather advanced mathematics, but it is\r\njust the reverse of what happens in the steamer.\r\n\r\nThe machinery in the steamer turns the screw, and the pressure of the\r\nwater, which is thrown off, forces the boat through the water; in the\r\ncase of the pineseed, the pressure of the air on the flying wings\r\nmakes the seed twirl or turn round and round, and so the seed must\r\nbe a much longer time in falling. They often fly to about 80 or 100\r\nyards away from the parent tree.\r\n\r\nOnce upon the ground, the seed has to germinate _if it can_; its root\r\nhas to pierce the soil or find a way in between crevices of rocks or\r\nsharp-edged stones. All the time it is exposed to danger from birds,\r\nbeasts, and insects, which are only kept off by its resin. But it is\r\ndifficult to see, for its colour is just that of dead pine needles\r\nand its shape is such that it easily slips into crevices. Then the\r\nseven or eight small green seed leaves break out of the tough seed\r\ncoat, and the seedling is now a small tree two inches high. It may\r\nhave to grow up through grass or bramble, or through bracken, which\r\nlast is perhaps still more dangerous and difficult. It will probably\r\nbe placed in a wood or plantation where hundreds of thousands of its\r\ncousins are all competing together. \"In this case, the struggle\r\nfor life is intense: each tree seeking for sunlight tries to push\r\nits leader-shoots up above the general mass of foliage; but all are\r\ngrowing in height, whilst the lateral branches which are cramped\r\nby the neighbouring trees are continually thrown off. The highest\r\nbranches alone get sufficient light to remain alive, but they cannot\r\nspread out freely. They are strictly limited to a definite area; the\r\ncrown is small and crowded by those of the trees next to it, and the\r\ntrunk is of extraordinary length.\"\r\n\r\nThe above quotation from Albert Fron's _Sylviculture_ (Paris, 1903)\r\nrefers to an artificial forest cultivated and watched over by man.\r\nBut the trees in such forests have \"extra\" dangers and difficulties\r\nto fight against. Even scientific foresters admit that they are very\r\nignorant of what they are trying to do. In fact, the more scientific\r\nthey are, the more readily they will confess how little they really\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nWatch a labourer in a nursery transplanting young pine trees; each\r\nseedling tree has a long main root which is intended to grow as\r\nstraight down into the ground as it possibly can. All the other roots\r\nbranch off sideways, slanting downwards, and make a most perfect\r\nthough complicated absorbing system. With his large hand the man\r\ngrasps a tree and lifts it to a shallow groove which he has cut in\r\nthe soil. Then his very large, heavy-nailed boot comes hard down on\r\nthe tender root-system. The main root, which ought to point down,\r\npoints sideways or upwards or in any direction, and the beautifully\r\narranged absorbing system is entirely spoilt. The wretched seedling\r\nhas to make a whole new system of roots, and in some trees never\r\nrecovers.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of animals, insects, and funguses are ready to attack our\r\nyoung tree. Squirrels in play will nibble off its leading shoots.\r\nCattle will rub against its bark, and the roedeer, a very beautiful\r\ncreature, and yet a destructive little fiend from the tree's point of\r\nview, nibbles the young shoots and tears the bark with its horns.\r\n\r\nA tree's life is full of peril and danger. Yet it is most wonderfully\r\nadapted to survive them. Take a knife and cut into the bark of a pine\r\ntree, and immediately a drop of resin collects and gathers on the\r\nwound. After a short time this will harden and entirely cover the\r\nscar. Why?\r\n\r\nThere are in the woods, especially in Canada and North Russia,\r\nhundreds of insects belonging to the most different kinds, which have\r\nthe habit of laying their eggs in the wood of tree-trunks. In those\r\nregions the entire country is in the winter covered with snow and\r\nice for many months. Insects must find it difficult to live, for the\r\nground is frozen to a depth of many feet. Where are the eggs of these\r\ninsects to be stored up so that they can last through the winter\r\nwithout injury?\r\n\r\nThere is one insect at least, or rather many, of which the Giant\r\nSawfly may be taken as an example, which have ingeniously solved\r\nthis problem. She painfully burrows into the trunk of a tree and\r\ndeposits her eggs with a store of food at the end of the burrow. A\r\ndrop of resin or turpentine, which would clog her jaws, makes this a\r\ndifficult task, but, as we find in many other instances, it is not\r\nimpossible, but only a difficulty to conquer. If it were not for the\r\nresin, trees might be much more frequently destroyed by Sawflies than\r\nthey are.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of the Sawfly is a long, fleshy maggot. Just at the end\r\nare the strong woodcutting jaws by which it devours the wood and\r\neats its way out as soon as it feels the genial warmth of spring\r\npenetrating through the tree-bark. Many other insects hibernate or\r\nlay their eggs in tree-trunks. Some are caterpillars of moths, such\r\nas the well-known Goat moth; others are beetles, such as one which\r\nburrows between the bark and the wood of apple trees. The mother\r\nbeetle lays a series of eggs on each side of her own track. Each\r\negg produces a grub which eats its way sideways away from the track\r\nof the mother. The track made by these grubs gets gradually wider,\r\nbecause the maggots themselves grow larger and more fat with the\r\ndistance that they have got from their birthplace. We shall find\r\nother instances of burrowing insects when we are dealing with rubber\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThis resin or turpentine is a very interesting and peculiar\r\nsubstance, or rather series of substances. It is valuable because\r\ntar, pitch, rosin, and colophony are obtained by distilling it.\r\n\r\nWhen travelling through the coast forests of pine trees in the Landes\r\nof Western France, one notices great bare gashes on the stems leading\r\nround and down the trunk to a small tin cup or spout. These trees are\r\nbeing tapped for resin, from which rosin is manufactured. It would be\r\ndifficult to find any obvious connexion between music and the Giant\r\nSawfly. Yet the rosin used by Paganini and Kubelik has probably been\r\ndeveloped in Conifers to keep away sawflies and other enemies. This\r\nvery district, the Landes in France, was once practically a desert,\r\nand famous as such in French history. The soil was so barren that no\r\nvillages or cultivation were found over the whole length of it. Now\r\nthat it is planted with trees which are able to yield firewood and\r\nrosin, it is comparatively rich and prosperous.\r\n\r\nStorms are also very dangerous for tree-life. One can only realize\r\nthe beauty of a tree by watching a pine or ash in a heavy gale of\r\nwind. The swing of the branches, the swaying of the trunk, the\r\nbalancing support of the roots which, buttress-like, extend out into\r\nthe soil, give some idea of the extraordinary balance, toughness,\r\nand strength in trees. Except in the case of the common umbrella,\r\nwhich is an inefficient instrument in high wind, engineers have\r\nnever attempted the solution of the problem satisfactorily solved by\r\ntrees. A factory chimney only 51 feet in height will have a diameter\r\nat the base of at least three feet. This means that the height is\r\nabout seventeen times its diameter. But the Ryeplant, with a diameter\r\nat base of 3 millimetres, may be 1500 mm. high! That is, the height\r\nis five hundred times its diameter, and the Ryeplant has leaves\r\nand grain to support as well as its own stem! In Pine forests on\r\nexposed mountain sides there is almost always at least a murmuring\r\nsound, which in a storm rises into weird howls and shrieks. With\r\nGreek insight and imagination, the ancients supposed that spirits\r\nwere imprisoned in these suffering, straining pines. That is most\r\nbeautifully expressed in _The Tempest_, where the dainty spirit\r\nAriel had been painfully confined in a pine tree for a dozen years,\r\nand \"his groans did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts of\r\never-angry bears.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting points in botany depends on the fact that\r\nevil conditions of any sort tend to bring about their own remedy.\r\nEndymion's spear was of \"toughest ash grown on a windy site\" (Keats).\r\nThe prosaic chemical analyses of German botanists have, in fact,\r\nconfirmed the theory there suggested, for it is found that the wood\r\nof trees grown in exposed windy places is really denser and tougher\r\nthan that of others from sheltered woods.[11]\r\n\r\n  [11] Hartig finds the specific gravity of the wood in a tree is\r\n  increased from 0-60 to 0.74 when the surrounding wood has been\r\n  cut down.--_Bot. Central_, vol. xxx, p. 220.\r\nIf one realizes all these dangers from insects, animals, and storms,\r\nthe height to which some trees grow and the age to which they live\r\nbecome matters for astonishment and surprise.\r\n\r\nThe tallest trees in the world are probably certain Eucalyptus of\r\nAustralia, which have obtained a height of 495 feet above the ground.\r\n\r\nThey are by no means the _longest_ plants, for there are certain\r\n_rattans_ or canes, climbing plants belonging to the Palm family,\r\nwhich may be 900 feet long, although their diameter is not more than\r\ntwo inches.[12] There are also certain Seaweeds in the Southern\r\nOcean, off the coast of Chile, which attain a prodigious length\r\nof 600 feet (_Macrocystis pyriferus_, or \"Kelp\"). That is not so\r\nremarkable, for their weight is supported by other plants in the case\r\nof the rattans, and as regards the seaweeds, by the water in which\r\nthey float.\r\n\r\n  [12] Bonnier, _Cours de Botanique_.\r\n\r\nThe next in order to the Eucalyptus are those well-known Mammoth\r\nor Big trees of California (_Sequoia gigantea_). They grow only in\r\ncertain valleys in the Sierra Nevada, at an altitude of 5000-8000\r\nfeet. Their height is usually given as from 250-400 feet, and the\r\ndiameter sometimes exceeds thirty-five feet. Since they have become a\r\ncentre of the tourist-industry in the United States, various methods\r\nhave been adopted to make their size more easily realized. Thus a\r\ncoach with four horses and covered by passengers is (or used to be)\r\ndriven through a gateway made in one of them. The trunk of another\r\nhas been cut off some feet from the ground, and a dancing-saloon has\r\nbeen made on the stump. It is at least doubtful if dancing would be\r\nvery agreeable upon such a cross-grained sort of floor! A complete\r\nsection of one of them was carried across the United States to make\r\na dining-room table for an American millionaire. The age of one of\r\nthese trees has been estimated at 3300 years. That is to say that\r\nit was a seedling in 1400 B.C., and has been peacefully growing in\r\na Californian valley during all the time when Greece, Rome, Spain,\r\nFrance, Britain, and of course the United States, developed their\r\ncivilizations. The specimen of the Mammoth tree in the Natural\r\nHistory Museum in London was 1335 years old.\r\n\r\nThe possible age of many of our common trees is much greater than any\r\none would suppose. The \"Jupiter\" oak in the forest of Fontainebleau\r\nis supposed to be 700 years old. Another oak which was cut down at\r\nBordya, in the Baltic provinces of Russia, was supposed to be about\r\n1000 years old. Other millennial trees are or were another oak and\r\ntwo chestnuts: the oak grew in the Ardennes, the chestnuts still\r\nflourish, one at Sancerre (France), and the other the famous specimen\r\non Mount Etna. There are also eight olive trees in the garden of\r\nGethsemane at Jerusalem, which are certainly 1000 years old, and\r\nwere, according to tradition, in existence in the time of Jesus\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nAnd yet all these trees are mere infants compared to Adanson's Baobab\r\nand the Dragon tree of Orotava. The celebrated traveller alluded to\r\nvisited the Cape Verde islands in 1749 and found inscriptions made by\r\nEnglish travellers on the trunk 300 years before his time. From the\r\ngrowth since then, he calculated that some of these trees were about\r\n6000 years of age, and they were 27 feet in diameter.[13]\r\n\r\n  [13] Bonnier, _l.c._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A DRAGON TREE IN THE CANARY ISLANDS\r\n\r\n  Said to be about eight hundred years old]\r\n\r\nThe record is held by the Dragon tree of Orotava, in the Canary\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nWhen the Spaniards landed in Teneriffe in 1402, its diameter was\r\nvery nearly 42 feet. It was, however, greatly injured by a storm in\r\n1827, and finally destroyed in 1851. (The wood was then made into\r\nwalking-sticks and snuffboxes.) The age has been estimated at 10,000\r\nyears, or by other authorities at 8000 years only. The \"dragon's\r\nblood\" of the Canaries, a well-known remedy in the Middle Ages,\r\nwas not, as is popularly supposed, derived from this tree, but was\r\nobtained from a totally different plant.\r\n\r\nBut there is a hazy tradition to the effect that the story of the\r\nDragon which guarded the golden fruit in the island of the Hesperides\r\nwas nothing but a garbled account of this redoubtable veteran of the\r\nplant world.\r\n\r\nThere is no particular advantage in growing to these enormous heights\r\nand clinging to life in this way for hundreds and thousands of years.\r\nNature seems to have found this out and preferred the ordinary pines,\r\noaks, and larches, which are mature in a few hundred years. In a\r\nthousand years, ten generations of larch or pine can be produced,\r\nand, as each is probably better than its predecessor, a distinct\r\nimprovement in the type is possible. All these long-lived giants\r\nbelong in fact to the less highly specialized orders of plants.\r\nThey are like the primeval animals, the Mammoths, Atlantosauri, and\r\nSabretoothed Tigers.\r\n\r\nYet when we come to think of the many and diverse perils to which\r\ntrees are exposed, the existence of even these exceptional monsters\r\nseems very wonderful.\r\n\r\nAfter a violent storm which had blown down many of the trees in a\r\nfriend's park,[14] I visited the scene of destruction and discovered\r\nwhat had apparently in almost every instance produced it. Rabbits had\r\noverthrown these trees!\r\n\r\n  [14] Dunlop House, Kilmarnock.\r\n\r\nThey had nibbled away part of the cork and part of the young wood\r\non the projecting buttress-like roots at the base of the tree. In\r\nconsequence, water, bacteria, and fungus spores had entered at the\r\ninjured places, and part of the roots had become decayed and rotten.\r\nWhen the gale began to sway them backwards and forwards and a severe\r\nstrain came on what should have been a sound anchoring or supporting\r\nbuttress, the rotten part yielded, and these fine, beautiful trees\r\nfell a prey to the rabbit.\r\n\r\nThe influence of forests and timber on the daily life of mankind is a\r\nmost romantic and interesting chapter in history.\r\n\r\nEvery savage tribe, every race of man, however degraded or backward,\r\nis acquainted with fire. Fuel is therefore a necessity of existence\r\nfor all savages, and not merely for cooking. There is a very\r\ninteresting passage in London's _The Call of the Wild_, when the\r\nDog \"Buck\" in his dreams remembers a hairy man crouching over the\r\nfire with Buck's ancestor at his feet, whilst in the darkness all\r\nround them the firelight is reflected from eyes of wolves, bears,\r\nand even more terrible and dangerous brutes which have now happily\r\nvanished from the world. For protection at night fire was an absolute\r\nnecessity. Even at that long-distant period, therefore, man had\r\ncommenced to attack the forest. Unless one has had to tend a wood\r\nfire for twelve hours, it is difficult to realize what a quantity\r\nis required. To prepare fire was a long, laborious, and difficult\r\noperation; one piece of wood was placed on the ground and held in\r\nposition by the toes, a pointed stick was taken between the two palms\r\nof the hand and twirled vigorously round and round until the heat was\r\nenough to ignite a piece of rotten wood placed as tinder.\r\n\r\nTherefore smouldering branches were kept always burning, as they\r\nare to-day amongst the Fuegians and some other savages. It was a\r\nsacred duty to watch this fire, and the woman (usually old) who was\r\nentrusted with the task was very probably put to death if she failed.\r\nFrom this very ancient savage custom probably arose the cult of the\r\nVestal Virgins in Ancient Rome.[15]\r\n\r\n  [15] It will be remembered that they were obliged to keep the\r\n  sacred fire always burning, and were put to death if they\r\n  misbehaved. The fire was never allowed to go out during the whole\r\n  of Roman history, and the custom has been even preserved in some\r\n  Roman Catholic convents and chapels.\r\n\r\nAnother very important factor in savage life was the canoe or piroque\r\nnecessary for fishing or to cross lakes and rivers. The first chantey\r\nof Rudyard Kipling has a probable theory, and is a beautiful account\r\nof how man first thought of using a floating log.[16] They hollowed\r\nout the log and \"dug out\" the canoe, by first lighting a fire on it\r\nand then scraping away the cinders; then the sides were pressed out,\r\nand it was trimmed and straightened to the right shape. All this\r\nwas the idea of some paleolithic genius far more persevering and\r\ningenious than any marine architect of our own days.\r\n\r\n  [16] _Seven Seas._\r\n\r\n\"Birchbark\" canoes are not so common as Dug-outs. The tree, the White\r\nor Paper Birch, is found in Canada and the Northern United States;\r\nthose Indians who discovered that the light, waterproof cork-bark\r\ncould be fashioned into a canoe made a very great discovery, and\r\nindeed it was their canoes that made travel or exploration possible\r\nin North America.\r\n\r\nWhen man began to long for a settled permanent home, it was\r\nabsolutely necessary to find a way of living in safety. Wolves,\r\nbears, hyenas and other animals were abundant; neighbours of his own\r\nor other tribes were more ferocious and more dangerous than wild\r\nbeasts. Some neolithic genius imagined an artificial island made of\r\nlogs in the midst of a lake or inaccessible swamp. Such were the lake\r\ndwellings which persisted into historic times, and which are indeed\r\nstill in existence in some parts of the earth.[17]\r\n\r\n  [17] Munro, _Lake Dwellings_.\r\n\r\nThe trees were abundant; they could be felled by the help of fire and\r\nan axe, and the lake dwelling gave a secure defence. The wood of some\r\nof the piles supporting the great villages in Switzerland seems to be\r\nstill sound, though it has been under water for many centuries. Some\r\nvillages are said to have required hundreds of thousands of trees.\r\n\r\nThe forest afforded man almost everything that he used, bows and\r\narrows, shelter, fuel, and even part of his food.\r\n\r\nNuts and fruits would be collected and when possible stored. In\r\nseasons of famine, they used even to eat the delicate inside portion\r\nof the bark of trees.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as the first half-civilized men began to keep cattle,\r\nsheep, and especially goats, more serious inroads still were made\r\nupon the forest. Where such animals are allowed to graze there is\r\nno chance for wood to grow (at any rate in a temperate country).\r\nThe growing trees and the branches of older ones are nibbled away\r\nwhilst they are young and tender. The days of the forest were nearly\r\nover when cultivation commenced. Dr. Henry describes the process of\r\n\"nomadic\" culture in China as follows: \"They burn down areas of the\r\nforest; gather one or two crops of millet or upland rice from the\r\nrich forest soil; and then pass on to another district where they\r\nrepeat the destruction.\"[18] A very similar process of agriculture\r\nexisted until the eighteenth century in Scotland.\r\n\r\n  [18] _Royal Dublin Society_, vol. i. part v. No. 11.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & Underwood_\r\n    _London and New York_\r\n\r\n  SHOOTING THE HOZU RAPIDS IN JAPAN\r\n\r\n  The logs in the long train of rafts are of bamboo tied together.\r\n  In spite of their fragile nature the lumbermen are so fearless\r\n  and agile that they cleverly steer the frail bundles with but few\r\n  accidents.]\r\n\r\nThus the forest was being burnt or cleared for cultivation. It was\r\ndevastated by black cattle, goats, and other animals, and it was\r\nregularly exploited for fuel and building every day by every family\r\nfor centuries.\r\n\r\nIt is not, therefore, surprising that the ancient forests in Britain\r\nhave disappeared. Dr. Henry mentions one square mile of virgin\r\nforest on the Clonbrock estate in Ireland. The _Silva Caledonica_\r\nof the Romans is said to exist in Scotland at the Blackwood of\r\nRothiemurchus, at Achnacarry, and in a few other places. Of the\r\noriginal oak forest, which covered most of England and Southern\r\nScotland, not a vestige (so far as is known to the writer) remains\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThere are in places very ancient forests. A few miles from Retford\r\nare considerable remains of Sherwood Forest, which is for ever\r\nassociated with that genial bandit Robin Hood. One huge oak (called\r\nthe Major) has or used to have a keeper always on guard and paid by\r\nLord Manvers, but there are hundreds of aged oaks all round it. Then\r\nthere is the Knightwood Oak and some other ancients in the New Forest.\r\n\r\nBut it is not certain that these even date so far back as the time of\r\nCanute, for so far as the New Forest is concerned, it seems that this\r\nwas formed either by Canute or by William I. The Saxons seem to have\r\ndestroyed most of the English forests.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland oak forest existed as far north as the Island of Lewis,\r\nin Caithness, Dornoch, Cromarty, and along Loch Ness, as well as\r\nin every county south of these.[19] The deer forests and grouse\r\nmoors, now desolate, whaup-haunted muir-land and peat mosses, were\r\nflourishing woods of magnificent Scots fir at no very distant\r\nperiod. They ascended the hills on the Cairngorms to 1400 or 1500\r\nfeet, and in Yorkshire to 2400 feet.[20]\r\n\r\n  [19] Niven, _Bot. Section British Association_, 1901.\r\n\r\n  [20] Boyd Watt, _Cairngorm Club Journal_, vol. iv. No. 20,\r\n  January, 1903; Smith, Lewis, _Roy. Geog. Soc. Journal_.\r\n\r\nEven in remote historical times, such as those of Canute, the\r\nforests had become seriously and dangerously destroyed. This king\r\nwas apparently the first to artificially protect the woods as a\r\nhunting preserve. He was followed by William the Conqueror and other\r\nsovereigns. The game preserves of the landed proprietors to-day are,\r\nof course, the remains of the same custom.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, we do not kill poachers or cut off their right\r\nhands, and we do not cut off the forepaws of poaching dogs, as used\r\nto be done in medieval days.\r\n\r\nThis connexion of forests with game no doubt prevented the entire\r\ndisappearance of wood, but when, as is the case in England, the\r\ncomfort of pheasants is thought of more importance than the\r\nscientific cultivation of forests, the result is often very\r\nunfortunate.\r\n\r\nThe use and value of timber is, however, too important a matter to\r\ntake up at the end of a chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nON FORESTS\r\n\r\n   The forests of the Coal Age--Monkey-puzzle and ginkgo--Wood, its\r\n   uses, colour, and smell--Lasting properties of wood--Jarrah and\r\n   deodar--Teak--Uses of birch--Norwegian barques--Destruction of\r\n   wood in America--Paper from wood pulp--Forest fires--Arid lands\r\n   once fertile--Britain to be again covered by forests--Vanished\r\n   country homes--Ashes at farmhouses--Yews in churchyards--History\r\n   of Man versus Woods in Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the first tree like? That is a very difficult question\r\nto answer. Perhaps the first forests were those of the great coal\r\nperiod, of which the remains, buried for untold ages in the earth,\r\nbecame the coal which we now burn.\r\n\r\nThe flames and red-glowing heat of a fire are the work of the\r\nsunlight which fell in these long-past ages through a steamy, misty\r\natmosphere, upon these weird, grotesque vegetables, unlike anything\r\nwhich now exists upon the earth. Their nearest allies amongst living\r\nplants are the little club-mosses which creep over the peat and\r\nthrough the heather in alpine districts.\r\n\r\nOf course no one can say exactly what these coal forests were like.\r\nBut although some modern authorities have questioned the general\r\naccuracy of the descriptions of Heer and others, yet, as they have\r\nnot given anything better in the way of description, we shall\r\nendeavour to describe them according to our own beliefs, and as they\r\nprobably existed in the Lanarkshire coalfield and other places in\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nIn that gloomy mirk of the Carboniferous epoch, an observer (if there\r\nhad been any) would have dimly perceived huge trunks rising to sixty\r\nor eighty feet and divided at the top into a very few branches. All\r\nbranches were covered over by comparatively quite small leaves.\r\nNot a bad idea of the Sigillarias, Lepidodendrons, etc., which\r\nmade the forest and can be obtained by carefully looking at a pan\r\nof Selaginella such as one finds in almost every botanical garden,\r\nand imagining this to be eighty feet high. Through the bottomless\r\noozy slime which formed the ground, horizontal runners and roots\r\npenetrated in every direction. Great fern-like plants might be\r\nobserved here and there. Sluggish rivers meandered slowly through\r\nthese forests, carrying silt and refuse (their deposits are our\r\nCannel coals). In the water and in pools, or perhaps in the mud,\r\nwere curious waterferns with coiled-up crozier-like leaves. Perhaps\r\nhorsetail-like plants of huge size might have formed great reed-beds\r\nto which those of to-day are as a plantation of one-year-old firs is\r\nto a pine forest that has lasted for a century.\r\n\r\nFishes and crustaceans, or lobster-like creatures, crawled and\r\nsquattered through the slime, pursued by salamander-like animals with\r\nweak limbs and a long tail. Some of these latter were seven to eight\r\nfeet long. Millipedes, scorpions, beetles and maybugs existed, and\r\nhuge dragonflies preyed on them.\r\n\r\nBut there is one very ancient group of trees, the Araucarias or\r\nMonkey-puzzles, which are by no means uncommon even now. The ordinary\r\none (_Araucaria imbricata_) is often planted in the British Isles,\r\nand it has, if you look closely at it, a most peculiar appearance.\r\nIt is like the sort of tree that a child would draw; it is a clumsy\r\nattempt at one, and very different from the exquisite irregularity of\r\nthe ash or oak.\r\n\r\nIts leaves are especially curious: they cover the branches very\r\nclosely, and are hard, rigid, and spiny. Its cones, though of the\r\nnature of pine-cones, are yet quite unique. The seeds are edible, and\r\nused to be an important article of diet to the Indians on the slopes\r\nof the Chilian Andes, where monkey-puzzle forests used to exist. This\r\nof course is a very out-of-the-way region; other species of Araucaria\r\nare found scattered about the world in a most perplexing manner. One\r\nkind grows in Norfolk Island, in the Pacific; another occurs in the\r\ninner mountainous districts of Brazil; there are some in Australia\r\nand others in New Caledonia.\r\n\r\nBut in the Jurassic period of geology, in the age of ammonites\r\nand gigantic lizards and crocodiles, Araucarias were the regular,\r\nordinary trees. They grew all over Europe, and apparently as far\r\nnorth as Greenland, and, indeed, seem to have existed everywhere.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the spiny leaves discouraged some huge lizard, perhaps\r\nAtlantosaurus himself (he was thirty feet high and one hundred feet\r\nlong), from browsing on its branches. Perhaps the Pterodactyls, those\r\nextraordinary bird or bat-like lizards, used to feed upon the seeds\r\nof the monkey-puzzle, and carried them in their toothed jaws to New\r\nCaledonia, Australia, and Norfolk Island. Other improved types have\r\ndriven the monkey-puzzles from Europe, Asia, and Africa, and taken\r\ntheir places, but in out-of-the-way districts of South America and\r\nAustralia they are still able to hold their own.\r\n\r\nAn ally of theirs, the Ginkgo or Maidenhair tree, seems to have been\r\nextremely common in certain geological periods. To-day it has almost\r\nentirely disappeared. A few trees were discovered in certain Chinese\r\ntemples, where they had been preserved as curiosities for centuries,\r\nbut it is almost extinct as a wild plant. The Bigtree group\r\n(_Sequoia_ p. 47) was a companion of the Ginkgo in its flourishing\r\nperiod. So also were the Sago palms or Cycads. All the ordinary\r\ntrees, Pines, Oaks, Beeches, and the like, did not appear upon the\r\nearth's surface till a much later period.\r\n\r\nThe most important economic product of trees is the timber which they\r\nfurnish. Wood, as we have tried to show in the last chapter, has been\r\nalways of the greatest importance to mankind. It is easily worked,\r\ndurable, buoyant, and light, and it is used for all sorts of purposes.\r\n\r\nSilver fir,[21] which is accustomed, when growing, to be continually\r\nswayed and balanced by the wind, is preferred for the sounding-board\r\nof pianos and for the flat part of violins, whilst Sycamore or hard\r\nMaple is employed for the back and sides of the latter.\r\n\r\n  [21] The Romans used it for ships' masts and spars.\r\n\r\nBut there are enormous differences in different kinds of woods.\r\nThe colour of wood varies from white (Beech), yellow (Satinwood),\r\nlemon-yellow and bluish red (sap and heartwood of Barberry), to dark\r\nand light brown mottled (Olive), black (Persimmon), and dark brown\r\n(Walnut). Some woods have a distinct smell or perfume. Cedarwood,\r\nSandalwood, Deal, and Teak, are all distinctly fragrant. The\r\nStinkwood of South Africa and the Til of Madeira have an unpleasant\r\nsmell.\r\n\r\nMore important in practice are the differences in the hardness and\r\nweight of wood. The Ironwood of India cannot be worked, as its\r\nhardness blunts every tool. It requires a pressure of something\r\nlike 16,000 lb. to force a square-inch punch to a depth of\r\none-twentieth of an inch in _Lignum vitæ_. Even Hickory and Oak (if\r\nof good quality) require a pressure of 3200 lb. to the square inch\r\nto do this. On the other hand the Cotton tree of India (_Bombax\r\nmalabaricum_) has exceedingly soft wood. It is quite easy to drive a\r\npin into the wood with the fingers.\r\n\r\nSome woods are far too heavy to float: many tropical woods are\r\nespecially very weighty. Perhaps the Black Ironwood, of which a cubic\r\nfoot weighs 85 lb., is the heaviest of all. But the same volume of\r\nPoplar, Willow, or Spruce does not weigh more than 24 lb.\r\n\r\nThere are many ancient and modern instances of the extraordinary\r\nway in which timber lasts when at all carefully looked after. Thus\r\nthe Cedar which \"Hiram rafted down\" to make the temple of Solomon\r\n(probably Cedar of Lebanon) seems to have been extraordinarily\r\ndurable. Pliny says that the beams of the temple of Apollo at Utica\r\nwere sound 1200 years after they were erected.\r\n\r\nCypress wood (_Cupressus sempervirens_) was often used to make chests\r\nfor clothes because the clothes moth cannot penetrate it, and it also\r\nlasts a very long time. There is a chest of this wood in the South\r\nKensington Museum which is 600-700 years old. The Cypresswood gates\r\nof Constantinople were eleven centuries old when they were destroyed\r\nby the Turks in 1453. The fleet of Alexander the Great, and the\r\nbridge over the Euphrates built by Semiramis, were made of Cypress.\r\nThis wood seems to have been of extraordinary value to the ancients,\r\nand was used for mummy cases in Egypt, for coffins by the Popes, as\r\nwell as for harps and organ pipes.[22]\r\n\r\n  [22] Most of these interesting details are found in Boulger's\r\n  valuable treatise on \"Wood.\"\r\nPerhaps the most valuable woods are Box, which is used for woodcuts,\r\nand Walnut, which used to be highly prized for gun-stocks, as much as\r\n£600 having been paid for a single tree.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting histories of trade in timber belong to the\r\ncommoner and more usual woods. The great woods of Jarrah (_Eucalyptus\r\nmarginata_) cover 14,000 square miles of Australia, but they are\r\nbeing rapidly cut down and sawn up into small blocks to be carried\r\nright across the world in order to form the pavement which London\r\ncabmen and cab-horses prefer to any other.\r\n\r\nOne remembers also the beautiful Deodar forests of Afghanistan, and\r\nthe Himalayas. Logs of deodar were floated down the rivers to form\r\nbridges or temple pillars in Srinagar, the capital of far Cashmere.\r\nNowadays great \"slides\" are made, winding down into the valleys from\r\nthe recesses of the hills. When winter approaches, water is sprinkled\r\non the logs which make the slide; this freezes and forms a slippery\r\ndescending surface, down which the deodar timber rushes till it\r\nreaches the low ground, where it is cut up into railway sleepers and\r\ntakes part in the civilizing of India.\r\n\r\nThe fragrant Teak has an oleoresin which prevents the destructive\r\nwhite ants from attacking it; it is the most valuable timber for\r\nshipbuilding, and grows in many places of India, Malaysia, Java, and\r\nSumatra. It floats down the rivers of Burmah, coming from the most\r\nremote hill jungles, and elephants are commonly used at the ports to\r\ngather the trunks from the water and pile them ready for shipment.\r\n\r\nThe Birch is carried all the way from Russia to Assam and Ceylon,\r\nin order to make the chests in which tea is sent to England and\r\nRussia (native Indian woods are also used). It is also used in the\r\ndistillation of Scotch whisky, for smoking herrings and hams, for\r\nclogs, baskets, tanning, dyeing, cordage, and even for making bread.\r\n\r\nBut one of the most curious and interesting sights in any seaport\r\nis sure to be an old white Norwegian or Swedish sailing barque or\r\nbrigantine. She will have a battered, storm-beaten appearance, and is\r\nyet obviously a comfortable home. The windows of the deck-house may\r\nbe picked out with a lurid green. The tall, slowmoving, white-bearded\r\nskipper and his wife, children, and crew, not to speak of a dog and\r\ncats, have their home on this veteran \"windjammer.\" She carries them\r\nfrom some unpronounceable, never-heard-of port in Norway, all over\r\nthe world. You may see her discharging a cargo of deal plank, through\r\nthe clumsy square holes in her stern, in a forgotten Fifeshire\r\nvillage, in Madagascar, in China, or in the Straits of Magellan. All\r\nher life she is engaged in this work, and her life is an exceedingly\r\nlong one, to judge from the Viking lines on which she is built.\r\n\r\nMoreover, her work is done so economically that it used to be much\r\ncheaper to use her cargo in Capetown than to utilize the beautiful\r\nforests of the Knysna and King Williamstown.\r\n\r\nBut there are not wanting signs that the forests of Norway, of\r\nSweden, and even those of the United States, are doomed.\r\n\r\nIt is said that seven acres of primeval forest are cut down to supply\r\nthe wood which is used up in making the paper required for one day's\r\nissue of a certain New York journal. What a responsibility and a\r\nsource of legitimate pride this must be to the journalists! Let us\r\nhope that the end justifies the means.\r\n\r\nBoulger calculates that in 1884 all the available timber from\r\n4,131,520 acres of Californian Redwood was used in making the\r\nsleepers of the railways then existing in the United States.\r\n\r\nHe finds that no less than 18,000,000 acres of forest are necessary\r\nto keep up the supply of sleepers for the old lines and to build new\r\nones.\r\n\r\nSo that, if we remember the wood required for paper, firewood, and\r\nthe thousand other important requisites of civilized man, the United\r\nStates must soon exhaust her supply and import wood.\r\n\r\nThen will come the opportunity of British North America. The Southern\r\nforest of Canada, which extended for 2000 miles from the Atlantic to\r\nthe head of the St. Lawrence, has indeed gone or is disappearing into\r\npulpwood and timber, but there is still the great Northern forest\r\nfrom the Straits of Belleisle to Alaska (4000 miles long and 700\r\nmiles broad), and in addition the beautiful forests of Douglas Spruce\r\nand other trees in British Columbia covering 285,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nIt is the wood-pulp industry which is at present destroying the\r\nCanadian forests. The penny and halfpenny papers, and indeed most\r\nbooks nowadays, are made of paper produced by disintegrating wood:\r\nit is cheap, and can be produced in huge quantities; nevertheless it\r\nis disquieting to reflect that probably nineteen-twentieths of the\r\nliterary output of the twentieth century will be dust and ashes just\r\nabout the same time (some fifty years) that the writers who produced\r\nit reach the same state.[23]\r\n\r\n  [23] Compare the report by the Society of Arts.\r\n\r\nYet, considering the amount daily produced to-day, the future readers\r\nof fifty years hence who are now in their cradles, may consider this\r\na merciful dispensation of Providence.\r\n\r\nOne very curious use of wood may be mentioned here. Near Assouan,\r\non the First Cataract of the Nile, one discovers broken granite or\r\nsyenite needles, which had been intended by the ancient Egyptians\r\nfor monuments. Where the broken pillar lies, there are rows of\r\nwedge-shaped holes cut in the rock.\r\n\r\nThey used to drive in wedges of dry wood and then wet them with\r\nwater. The expansion of the wood split the rock, though this is hard\r\ngranite or syenite. Very often the process failed because the stone\r\ncracked. The same method is said to be still used in some quarries.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the forest is really necessary. Most of the corn\r\nland and rich pasture of the world has been at one time forest. It\r\ncould scarcely be such fertile soil if it had not been for the many\r\nyears during which leaf-mould fell on it, and the roots broke up and\r\npenetrated the subsoil below. Canada, Russia, and the United States\r\nare now passing through the same experience as that of Great Britain\r\nin the time of the Romans, Saxons, and Danes.\r\n\r\nBut there is terrible waste by fire.\r\n\r\nWhen the trees become dry and withered in the height of summer in\r\neither India or the United States, some careless tramp may throw\r\naside a lighted match. If a fire once starts, it spreads with\r\nenormous rapidity; great clouds of smoke roll over the surrounding\r\ncountry, and every village sounds the alarm. Everybody rushes to\r\nhelp and try to stop the conflagration, or if too late hurriedly\r\nsaves whatever he can get of his possessions. His log hut and all the\r\naccumulations of years of saving may be turned into a heap of ashes\r\nin a very few minutes.\r\n\r\nBut the crackling of the leaves and the flaming twigs and scorching\r\nbark make such a volume of fire that nothing which man can do is of\r\nany avail.\r\n\r\nOf course every beast, every bird and insect is in the greatest\r\npossible danger.\r\n\r\nThis is how a fire in New Zealand has been described by Mr. William\r\nSatchell:--[24]\r\n\r\n  [24] _The Toll of the Bush._\r\n\r\n\"For a while it seemed that the battle must go to the wind, the\r\nfiery monster withdrew, lay hidden, roaring angrily in the dry heart\r\nof the woods; then insidiously he stretched forth his glittering\r\narms, first one, then another, and locking the shuddering trees in\r\nan irresistible embrace, sprang once again erect. In an instant the\r\nwhole bush from edge to edge became a seething, rocking mass of\r\nflames.\r\n\r\n\"'Fire! Fire!'\r\n\r\n\"Then, insignificant no longer, transfigured rather beyond all living\r\npossibilities of loveliness, the bush stood revealed to its centre.\r\nIt became less a fire than an incandescence, waxing in brilliance\r\nto the point when, as it seemed, it must perforce burst into\r\nindistinguishable flame. Every leaf and twig of that fairy forest was\r\nwrought and hammered in virgin gold, every branch and trunk was a\r\ncarved miracle of burnished copper. And from the golden leaves to the\r\ngolden floor, floatingly or swiftly, there fell an unceasing rain of\r\ncrimson flame petals, gorgeous flame fruits. Depth after depth stood\r\nrevealed, each transcending the last in loveliness. And as the eye\r\nsought to penetrate those magic interiors there seemed to open out\r\nyet farther vistas, beyond belief beautiful, as of the streets of a\r\ncity incorruptible, walled and towered, lost in the light of a golden\r\nincomparable star.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Fire! Fire!'\r\n\r\n\"In the face of that vision of glory the cry rang out with all the\r\nineptitude and inappropriateness of the human weakling. On one side\r\nthe titanic forces of nature, inexorable, eternal; on the other the\r\nman, frail of body, the creature of an hour, matching himself against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"'Fire! Fire!'\r\n\r\n\"Sheltering his face from the insufferable heat, the Swede\r\nhammered madly at the solid house-door. At the back, now utterly\r\nunapproachable, the kitchen, the roof, and a part of the main wall\r\nwere already in flames. A few minutes--five at the most--would\r\ncomplete the demolition of the house. To right and left the great\r\ntrees one after another went off like rockets, the roar of their\r\nburning foliage shaking the very earth. A deafening crashing of\r\nfalling timber came at intervals from the bush beyond.\"\r\n\r\nIn some countries the destruction of the forests has had a very\r\nserious effect on the climate. The rain which falls upon a forest is\r\npartly absorbed by the leaves, and but a very small part of it is\r\ncarried off by burns and streams: most sinks down into the forest\r\nsoil, and is only gradually given back again after being taken in by\r\nthe tree roots and evaporated by the leaves.\r\n\r\nBut bare hills denuded of wood allow most of their rain to rush down\r\nto the sea in dangerous spates of the rivers and burns, and then the\r\nground becomes afterwards very dry and burnt up. There are very many\r\ncountries now barren and desolate because they have been robbed of\r\nthe beautiful forests which once covered the springheads and mountain\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Palestine is one of the worst instances. But it is when we\r\nremember Babylon, Nineveh, and all the cities of the coast of Asia\r\nMinor, as they were even a thousand years ago, and compare their\r\npresent barren, desolate condition, that the full meaning of mountain\r\nforests becomes clear.\r\n\r\nWhere once there were thriving, prosperous cities with enormous\r\npopulations, now the goats graze or a few miserable peasants\r\ncarefully husband the water of a few miserable streams. The same\r\nthing has happened in Mauritius, in the Cape Verde and Canary\r\nIslands, and in many other places.\r\n\r\nBut men are now beginning to see how dangerous the destruction of\r\nforests may be, and in many countries and especially in Britain, new\r\nforests are being planted. Perhaps in time we may grow in Britain so\r\nmuch timber that we shall gain something like £32,000,000 a year,\r\nwhich is what we spend on imported woods.\r\n\r\nAt present plover, whaups, snipe, and grouse, or useless red deer,\r\ninhabit what was once the Caledonian forest, and every thousand\r\nacres of such land nowadays supports perhaps one shepherd and half\r\na gamekeeper. But when it is planted again with woodlands it will\r\nafford a living to at least ten foresters, and surely a whole\r\ngamekeeper as well.\r\n\r\nIn the lowlands of Scotland and in England one often discovers, in\r\nwalking over the hills, remains of cottages and farmhouses which have\r\nnow vanished. The people have gone into the towns, and the healthy\r\nyeomen and farmers' boys have become weak-chested factory hands and\r\nhooligans. Such sites of old farms can often be recognized by a\r\npatch of nettles, and especially by eight or nine ash trees. These\r\nwere always planted near the houses to give a ready supply of wood\r\nfor spears. The ash, \"for nothing ill,\" as Spenser puts it, would be\r\navailable also for repairing the handles of tools, carts, etc. Some\r\nauthorities say that it was the law of Scotland that these eight or\r\nnine ash trees should be planted at every \"farmtoon.\"\r\n\r\nSo also, when forests began to vanish in England, laws were made\r\nto the effect that yew trees should be planted in every village\r\nchurchyard. Probably this was to ensure a good supply of bows for\r\nthe English archers, who, like the Scottish spears, were the best\r\nsoldiers of their kind in Europe.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A FOREST FIRE\r\n\r\n  Such fires frequently occur in New Zealand, and the Maoris have\r\n  to fly for their lives.]\r\n\r\nSo that if we try to compare the conditions of man and of the forests\r\nin Great Britain from the earliest days, it would be something like\r\nthis:--\r\n\r\n1. When the earliest inhabitants lived on shell-fish, seabirds' eggs,\r\nnuts, and fruits, almost the whole country was covered by oak, Scotch\r\nfir, or birch forests.\r\n\r\n2. When man was a hunter of reindeer and other deer, horses, cattle,\r\nand birds, he used much wood for fires and for building his lake\r\ndwellings.\r\n\r\n3. When man kept herds of swine to eat acorns, black cattle, goats,\r\nand ponies, there would be many clearings and a great deal of open\r\nwood in which the cattle roamed about.\r\n\r\n4. When man grew corn and other plants, the forest vanished\r\naltogether. Dr. Johnson said he scarcely saw a tree between Carlisle\r\nand Edinburgh. Yet first the King, then the Barons, had their\r\nparks and woodlands for preserving game. Moreover, the yews in the\r\nchurchyards of England, and the ash trees by the Scotch farmtoons and\r\npeel-towers, were carefully looked after.\r\n\r\n5. When great towns arose, and men became factory hands and steel\r\nworkers, rich men began to make plantations in the lowlands, and to\r\nuse the depopulated highlands for grouse moors and deer forests.\r\n\r\n6. When men become wiser than they are now, it will be seen that\r\ngreat forests are necessary on all waste-land and barren places, both\r\nto keep a healthy country population and because it will pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFLOWERS\r\n\r\n   Man's ideas of the use of flowers--Sprengel's great\r\n   discovery--Insects, not man, consulted--Pollen carried to\r\n   set seed--Flowers and insects of the Whinstone Age--Coal\r\n   Age flowers--Monkey-puzzle times--Chalk flowers--Wind-blown\r\n   pollen--Extravagant expenditure of pollen in them--Flower of\r\n   the pine--Exploding flowers--Brilliant alpines--Intense life in\r\n   flowers--Colour contrasts--Lost bees--Evening flowers--Humming\r\n   birds and sunbirds--Kangaroo--Floral clocks--Ages of\r\n   flowers--How to get flowers all the year round--Ingenious\r\n   contrivances--Yucca and fig--Horrible-smelling flowers--Artistic\r\n   tastes of birds, insects, and man.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many centuries flowers were considered as pleasing and attractive\r\ndecorations stuck about the world in the same way as they are put in\r\na drawing-room in order to give people pleasure. Very soon they were\r\nfound to be extremely useful in poetry, sometimes to point a moral\r\nor disguise a sermon, like the primrose in _Peter Bell_, but more\r\ngenerally to produce a good impression on the BELOVED OBJECT. Burns\r\nputs the usual view of flowers very nicely in the following: \"But I\r\nwill down yon river rove amang the woods sae green, and a' to pu' a\r\nposie to my ain dear May.\" Possibly this is the meaning also in the\r\nexquisite lines of Shakespeare about the pansy:--\r\n\r\n    \"Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell:\r\n    It fell upon a little western flower,--\r\n    Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,--\r\n    And maidens call it, love-in-idleness.\"\r\n\r\nEven if there is no particular meaning, the \"little western flower\"\r\ngives point and beauty to the lines.\r\n\r\nPeople only began to understand flowers about the year 1793, when\r\nChristian Conrad Sprengel, Rector of Spandau, near Berlin, published\r\na very interesting work. He had discovered that the beauty of\r\nflowers and their colour and shape were by no means intended solely\r\nto please _human_ eyes, but that they were designed to attract and\r\nallure the eyes of _insects_. Before his time there had been many\r\nguesses. Indeed, Theophrastus (born 371 B.C., and often mentioned in\r\nthis work) seems to have quite well understood why flowers produce\r\npollen, and that the fruit would not set and form seed unless pollen\r\nwas carried to the female part of the flower. He mentions that the\r\nPistacio has both male and female plants, and that Palms only form\r\ndates when the pollen is carried to the female tree. This experiment\r\nwith the Date-palm was tried in 1592 by an Italian (Alpino) in an\r\nEgyptian tour, and the Englishman, Jacob Bobart, the Pole, Adam\r\nZaluzianski (the latter in the same year) confirmed the general idea.\r\nThen in the year 1694 Rudolp Jacob Camerarius, a German, carried on\r\na few more experiments, but no real definite advance was made until\r\n1793, in the very midst of the French Revolution.[25]\r\n\r\n  [25] The historical account by Bonnier, _Cours de Botanique_, is\r\n  very interesting and complete.\r\n\r\nThe great point of Sprengel's discovery was in its being an\r\nintelligible explanation of the reason why flowers have bright\r\ncolours, scent, and honey. At his time and indeed for many years\r\nafterwards, botanists looked on the stamens, petals, and other\r\nparts of the flower exactly in the way that a stamp collector looks\r\nat punctures and postmarks, that is without thinking about their\r\nmeaning. Now we find that they are always designed to fulfil a\r\nperfectly definite purpose, and that all their details are contrived\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nThis purpose is to carry the pollen from the stamens of one flower\r\nto the stigma of another. The pollen can usually be recognized as\r\na yellowish or reddish dust formed in the stamens; this dust is\r\ngenerally rubbed off on an insect's proboscis or on part of its body.\r\nWhen the insect reaches another flower the pollen is scraped off by\r\na sticky or gummy stigmatic surface. When the pollen has been placed\r\non this surface it grows, germinates, and part of it unites with the\r\negg-cell of the young seed.\r\n\r\nThe latter is then, and not till then, able to become ripe and\r\nmature. It may be compared to cross-breeding in animals, though the\r\nprocess does not exactly correspond.\r\n\r\nBut all flowers do not require insects to carry their pollen. In\r\nearly geological periods we do not find any flowers like those that\r\nnow exist, nor in those early times were there any flies, bees, or\r\nbutterflies.\r\n\r\nThe cockroach seems to have existed in Silurian (whinstone) times,\r\nand many gigantic and extraordinary insects lived in those damp\r\nforests of ferns, club-moss, and horsetails, of which the remains\r\nnow form our British coalfields. Mayflies, plantbugs, and especially\r\ndragonflies (some of them with wings two feet across) existed, but\r\nnone of these insects are of much use as pollen-carriers.\r\n\r\nEven much later on, when screw pines, monkey-puzzle trees, ginkgos,\r\nand bamboos formed the forests and woods of Europe, crickets and\r\nearwigs existed; but it is not until that geological period in which\r\nthe chalk was formed (the Cretaceous age) that fossil plants like\r\nmost of those now familiar to us occur. These had flowers intended\r\nfor insects, and with the fossil plants we find the fossils of the\r\ninsects that visited them. Bees, butterflies, and ordinary flies\r\nappeared upon the scene just as soon as there were flowers ready for\r\nthem. Mr. Scudder has even found the fossils of certain plants, and\r\nwith them the fossils of butterflies closely allied to the present\r\nbutterflies which now live on present trees allied to those fossils!\r\n\r\nHow then was the pollen of the first flowers carried?\r\n\r\nIt was in all probability blown by the wind or carried in water.\r\nEven now poplars, alders, birches, and oaks rely chiefly upon the\r\nwind to carry their pollen. These plants were amongst the first of\r\nour modern flora to appear upon the earth. Some of them possess very\r\nneat contrivances suited to the wind. The catkins of the alder, for\r\nexample, hang downwards, so that each little male flower is protected\r\nfrom rain by a little scale or bract above it. The pollen is very\r\nlight, dusty, or powdery, so as to fly a long distance. The Scotch\r\nfir (_Pinus sylvestris_) has male flowers in little cones. These are\r\nupright, and the pollen of each stamen drops on to a small hollow on\r\nthe top of the stamen below. It is then blown away by the wind on a\r\nfine dry day, but it is not allowed to get out in wet weather. It is\r\nsaid that vast clouds of pine pollen occur in America, and that the\r\nwater of certain lakes becomes quite yellow and discoloured by it at\r\ncertain seasons. Each little particle of pollen has two minute caps\r\nor air-balloons which give it buoyancy, so that it can float easily\r\nimmense distances.\r\n\r\nA curious little herb, the Wall Pellitory, and another foreign\r\nspecies, the Artillery plant, produces small explosions of pollen.\r\nWhen it is touched, there is a little puff or cloud of dusty pollen.\r\nEven the common Nettle does the same on fine dry days when it is in\r\nfull flower.\r\n\r\nBut of course this carrying of pollen by the wind is a very\r\nexpensive arrangement. It is so much a matter of pure chance that\r\na grain arrives at its right destination. Suppose that a flower\r\nis giving out clouds of pollen, then the chance of a pollen grain\r\nreaching a female flower only five feet away is very small, even if\r\nthe stigma of the female flower is a quarter of an inch in diameter.\r\nThe chance of pollen reaching it will only be about 1 to 1440; 1439\r\npollen grains will be wasted[26] for every one that reaches the\r\nstigma. But even this is not quite a fair calculation, for if the\r\nfemale flower is not down wind, none will reach it at all!\r\n\r\n  [26] The pollen from the great pine forests of the Italian Alps\r\n  blown up to the snow becomes used in nourishing the Pink or\r\n  Red Snow Algæ, which colours it a delicate rose-pink. In lower\r\n  grounds all such pollen becomes, like leaf-mould, a manure for\r\n  other plants. There is no _waste_, strictly speaking.\r\n\r\nBut if an insect goes to the catkin of an alder or any other male\r\nflower, it will see the red points of the stigma and will very likely\r\ngo there at once. This shows how much more reasonable and efficient\r\ninsects will be.\r\n\r\nThe immense majority of flowers are, in fact, purple, blue, red,\r\nyellow, or white, so that they are conspicuous, and stand clearly\r\nout against the green of their leaves. It is well known to all who\r\nhave arranged flowers for the table that the green of the leaves of\r\ndifferent plants varies greatly in its shade and tint. Many greens do\r\nnot match special flowers at all, but it is the fact that the green\r\nof any one plant is always quite harmonious, and agrees well with its\r\nown flowers!\r\n\r\nBesides varied and beautiful colours, sweet or strong scents and\r\nsupplies of honey or nectar are provided for insects.\r\n\r\nHow did flowers manage to produce all these attractions? No one has\r\nanswered that question. We know in a general sort of way that the\r\nparts of flowers are modified leaves, and that petals and stamens\r\nbecome yellowish or pure white because they do not form green\r\ncolouring matter like ordinary leaves.\r\n\r\nIt is also known that on the Alps or on any high mountain, where the\r\nair is pure and the sun strong, flowers become rich, brilliant, and\r\nvivid. In such places as the \"Jardin\" near Mont Blanc, the pure,\r\ndeep, rich blue of gentians, the crimsons, reds, and purples of other\r\nflowers, impress the most casual and unobservant traveller. \"White\r\nand red, yellow and blue, brown and green stand side by side on a\r\nhand's breadth of space.\" In that strong mountain air, also, perfumes\r\nare stronger, purer, and of finer quality than in the lowlands. There\r\nis a more intense, active, and vigorous life going on in flowers than\r\nis required by the more prosaic industries in other parts of a plant.\r\nFlowers also often live at a higher temperature than the surrounding\r\nair.\r\n\r\nKerner has described how the little flowers of Soldanella penetrate\r\nthe snow by actually melting a passage for themselves through it (see\r\np. 103).\r\n\r\nThis high temperature and vigorous life, shown also by the rapid\r\ntranspiration of flowers,[27] seems to hint that colours and perfumes\r\nappear in consequence of rapid chemical transformations.[28]\r\n\r\n  [27] _Pharmaceutical Journal_, May 20th, 1899.\r\n\r\n  [28] Buscalioni e Traverso, _Atti del Ist. Bot. di Pavia_, vol.\r\n  10, 1904.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, by degrees that the extraordinary variation\r\nin colour, which exists in nature, came about. No doubt bees,\r\nbumble-bees, wasps, and the more intelligent flies were improved and\r\ndeveloped æsthetically. We can almost tell by looking at a flower\r\nwhat sort of insect probably visits it.\r\n\r\nNot only so, but there are the neatest imaginable contrasts and\r\nblends of colour. The common Bluebeard Salvia, e.g., has the\r\nuppermost leaves (three-quarters to an inch long) of a deep, rich,\r\nblue-purple, which the roving Bumble-bee will see from a long way\r\noff. The Bumble-bee flies to this great splash of her favourite\r\nhue and for a second buzzes angrily, then she notes the small\r\n_bright-blue_ patches on the upper lips of the small flowers below\r\nthe leaves which are set off by _white_ hairs of the upper and\r\n_yellow_ hairs of the lower lip.\r\n\r\nThat bees really do understand and are guided by colour may be\r\ngathered from the following unfortunate accident. A certain hive\r\nof bees which had been brought up in a blue-striped skep became\r\naccidentally scattered. They tried to find their way back to their\r\nold home, but many strayed, and it was noticed that they had tried to\r\nenter the doors of every blue hive, which were strewn with the bodies\r\nof the unfortunate intruders.[29]\r\n\r\n  [29] Von Buttel, _Respen_.\r\n\r\nThe rich blue-purple of Aconite, the dark strong red of the Woundwort\r\n(_Stachys silvatica_) are specially beloved by bumble-bees and\r\nhive-bees. Butterflies like any bright colour. Those flies which have\r\na long, sucking proboscis, resemble the bees in their tastes, but all\r\nthese insects are quite capable of finding out where they can get\r\nhoney most easily, and visit flowers whatever the colour may be.\r\n\r\nA very strange and wonderful fact is that quite a number of plants\r\nprefer the dark, or rather the dim, mysterious light of the gloaming.\r\nThen the Honeysuckle, the Evening Campion, the Night-scented Stock,\r\nTobacco, and Schizopetalon give out their strongest scent and open\r\nout their white flowers as widely as possible. That is because they\r\nwish to attract the owlet moth and others which come out at this\r\ntime, when there are fewer enemies and more security. If you look\r\nat any of these moth-flowers at mid-day, they are for the most part\r\nclosed up, they are not particularly attractive, and they are giving\r\nout very little scent. The contrast to their condition in the evening\r\nis most striking.\r\n\r\nNot only insects but birds are used to carry pollen. The gorgeous\r\nlittle humming birds, with their brilliant metallic crimson,\r\nbronze-green, and purple, are of the greatest importance in the New\r\nWorld. In the Old World they are replaced by the tiny _Nectarinidæ_\r\nor Sunbirds, with breastplates almost as exquisitely jewelled. They\r\nprefer the most gorgeous reds and scarlets, such as that of _Salvia\r\nhorminum_, _Lobelia cardinalis_, and the like. Fuchsias are regularly\r\nvisited by them in Tierra del Fuego, where sometimes they may be seen\r\nbusily at work during a shower of snow. In South Africa they seize\r\nthe stem of a Redhot Poker (_Tritoma_) (_Kniphofia macowanii_), and\r\ntwisting their little heads round, they suck the honey from every\r\nblossom in succession. Still more interesting it is to see them\r\nperched on the edge of one of those great tumbler-like heads of\r\nProtea (e.g. _P. incompta_) and dipping their slender curved beaks\r\nrepeatedly into the flowers. Then the little male bird will alight\r\non a branch and make the most elaborate preparation for a song of\r\ntriumph. Although helped out by fluttering of wings and much display\r\nof feathers and tail, the song is a very faint cheep of the feeblest\r\ndescription, and very difficult to hear.\r\n\r\nNot only birds but even animals are sometimes called into the\r\nservice. There is a group of small mammals which live on the honey of\r\nflowers. Even the Kangaroo is said to occasionally take a draught of\r\nnectar from some of the cup-like flowers of the Australian Dryandra\r\n(_Proteaceae_).\r\n\r\nBut one of the most interesting and extraordinary facts is the\r\nmanner in which flowers fit in. They begin early in the morning: one\r\nblossom opens out and then another; all endeavouring to catch the\r\nattention of some passing insect. _Allionia violacea_ opens at three\r\nor four a.m., and closes about eleven or twelve. Some wild Roses open\r\nabout four or five in the morning, as well as the Chicory, Roemeria,\r\netc. Virginian Spiderwort, Dandelion, and Nightshade are ready at\r\nsix in the morning. A great many (Buttercups, White Water Lily,\r\netc.) are open by seven a.m. Most of these early flowers are shut at\r\nnoon. Others begin to close about three or four in the afternoon.\r\nThe regular evening moth-flowers open about six p.m., though _Cactus\r\ngrandiflorus_ does not open till nine or ten p.m., and closes at\r\nmidnight.[30] Extraordinary as these variations seem, they are easily\r\nexplained. Some open early because there are then few competitors. By\r\nfar the greater number are open from nine a.m. till one or two p.m.,\r\nbecause those hours are the favourite working time of most insects.\r\n\r\n  [30] Linnæus and many others have made Floral Clocks. Kerner,\r\n  _Natural History of Plants_, describes the opening and closing of\r\n  flowers very fully.\r\n\r\nFlowers live for very different periods. That of the Wheat only lasts\r\nfor fifteen or twenty minutes (its pollen is carried by wind), and\r\nis then over. There are others, Hibiscus and Calandrinia, which only\r\nremain open for three or four hours, but a Foxglove will last six\r\ndays, a Cyclamen ten days, whilst Orchids may last for from thirty\r\nto eighty days (_Cypripedium villosum_, seventy days, _Odontoglossum\r\nRossii_, eighty days).\r\n\r\nThus the sun every day through the summer, as he calls into life new\r\nswarms of insects, sees at every hour of the day new flowers opening\r\ntheir petals to his genial warmth and ready for the new bees and\r\nflies. The development of the flower and that of its insect are\r\nprobably simultaneous, and equally regulated by the sun's warmth.\r\nMoreover the opening periods do not merely fit in during the day, but\r\neach flower has its own special month, and even in Scotland there is\r\nno month in which some flower may not be found in bloom. Any stray\r\nwandering insect can get its draught of honey at any season of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThis is a matter of some importance for those who keep bees, and\r\nthe following list may be of some use. _February_: _Crocus vernus_,\r\nSnowdrop, Black Hellebore, and Hazel. _March_: The preceding, _Arabis\r\nalpina_, Bulbocodium, _Cornus mascula_, _Helleborus foetidus_, Giant\r\nColtsfoot, Gooseberry, various species of Prunus and Pyrus, Willow.\r\n_April_: The preceding as well as _Adonis vernalis_, _Barbarea\r\nvulgaris_, _Brassica napus_.\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while noting those that bloom from May to September,\r\nfor there are hundreds of good bee-flowers in these months. In\r\n_October_: Borage, Echium, Sunflowers, _Lycium europæum_, _Malope\r\ngrandiflora_, Catmint, Tobacco, Ocimum, Origanum, _Phacelia\r\ntanacetifolia_, and others. Most of these last into November.[31]\r\nIn December and January very few plants are in bloom. The following\r\nhave been noted at Edinburgh Botanical Gardens: _Dondia epipactis_,\r\n_Tussilago fragrans_, Snowdrop, _Geum aureum_, Hepatica, _Primula\r\nacaulis_, _P. veris_, _Aubrietia deltoidea_, _Crocus imperati_, _C.\r\nsuaveolens_, _Erica herbacea alba_, Helleborus (3 species), _Polygala\r\nchamaebuxus_, _Andromeda floribunda_; also Sir H. Maxwell[32]\r\nmentions _Azara integrifolia_, _Hamamelis_ _arborea_, and\r\n_Chimonanthus fragrans_. Of wild plants, Chickweed, Whin or Furze,\r\n_Lamium purpureum_, and Dandelion can generally be found in the depth\r\nof winter.\r\n\r\n  [31] Huck, _Unsere Honig u. Bienenpflanzen_. These are drawn up\r\n  for Germany, and cannot be warranted for this country.\r\n\r\n  [32] _Memories of the Months._\r\n\r\nThe contrivances which can be found in flowers, and by which the\r\ninsect is forced to enter exactly along the proper path, are endless.\r\nEach flower has some little peculiarity of its own which can only\r\nbe understood by thoroughly examining the plant itself. It is not\r\ntherefore possible to do justice to the ingenuity of flowers in\r\na work of this sort. There are orchids which throw their insect\r\nvisitors into a bath of water, so that they have to crawl with wet\r\nwings up a certain path where they touch the pollen masses and\r\nstigma; others which hurl their pollen masses at the visitor. In the\r\nAsclepiads a groove is provided into which the leg of the insect\r\nslips, so that it has to struggle to get its foot out, and must\r\ncarry off the pollen masses, though it often fails and leaves its\r\nleg behind. Some Arums and Aristolochias have large traps in which\r\nthey imprison the insects, and only let them go when they are sure\r\nto be pollen-dusted. In one of these flowers there are transparent\r\nspots on the large petal-prison, which so attract the insects that\r\nthey remain opposite them instead of flying out (just as flies do\r\non a window-pane). Salvia has a stamen which is like a see-saw on a\r\nsupport; the bee has to lift up one end, which brings the other with\r\nits pollen flat down on to its back. The Barberry has a sensitive\r\nspot on its stamen; when the insect touches the spot, the stamen\r\nsprings up suddenly and showers pollen upon it. In Mimulus the two\r\nflaps of the stigma close up as soon as they are touched, which will\r\nbe when they have scraped off any pollen; then when the creature\r\nwithdraws, covered with the flower's own pollen, none of this can be\r\nleft on its own stigma, as this is shut up.\r\n\r\nBut instead of reading, one should watch a bumble-bee visiting the\r\nFoxglove flowers. The sight of her busily thrusting her great hairy\r\nbody into the bell, which almost exactly fits her shape, while she\r\ngurgles with satisfaction, will teach the reader far more about\r\nthe romance of flowers than many pages of description. If he then\r\ncarefully examines the flower, he will see how the honey, the arched\r\nconverging stamens, and the style, are placed exactly in the right\r\nplace and where they will have the most effect.[33]\r\n\r\n  [33] Compare Shelley, who watched all day \"the yellow bees in\r\n  the ivy bloom,\" but he \"did not heed what things they be.\" Moreover,\r\n  though he appreciated the general spirit of the bee, it is very\r\n  unlikely that he saw any of them on the Ivy!\r\n\r\nOne orchid, _Angraecum sesquipedale_, has a spur eighteen inches\r\nlong, and the great Darwin suggested that there must be an insect\r\nsomewhere with a tube long enough to reach the honey. Such an insect,\r\na large moth, was actually brought home from Madagascar, the place\r\nwhere this orchid occurs, after a lapse of many years!\r\n\r\nPerhaps more remarkable than anything else are such cases as the\r\nYucca and the Yucca-moth or the Fig-wasp and the Fig.\r\n\r\nThe Yucca is a fine lily-like plant resembling the Aloes in general\r\nappearance. A particular sort of moth lives entirely upon the Yucca.\r\nWhen the flowers open, the mother-moth kneads up a ball of pollen and\r\nplaces an egg inside. This ball she thrusts down the style into the\r\novary of the flower. There a grub develops from the egg and eats the\r\npollen, yet some of this pollen fertilizes the young seeds. If Yuccas\r\ndied out the moth would be exterminated. If the moths were destroyed,\r\nno Yuccas would ever set their seed!\r\n\r\nThe Fig has two sorts of flower. The one (caprifig) produces only\r\nmale or pollen-yielding flowers. The other is the true edible fig.\r\nInside the caprifig are the grubs of the fig-wasp, which rejoice in\r\nthe name of _Blastophaga grossorum_. When grown up these force their\r\nway out of the caprifig and, flying to the true fig, the mother-wasp\r\nlays her eggs in certain flowers which have been apparently\r\nspecially modified for the purpose. At the same time she covers the\r\nordinary flowers with pollen from the caprifig. Her progeny return\r\nto the caprifig. Here again the future of a valuable fruit-tree\r\nis absolutely bound up with the fortunes of a tiny and in no way\r\nattractive wasp!\r\n\r\nAnother very remarkable case is that of those flowers (Stapelia,\r\netc.), which in colour and general marking closely resemble decaying\r\nmeat or other objectionable substances. Very often the smell of such\r\nflowers is exceedingly strong, and resembles the ordinary smell of\r\nputrid matter. In one case an artist employed to paint the flower had\r\nto use a glass bell, which was put over it. He could only lift it for\r\na second or two at intervals in order to see the exact colour, before\r\nthe horrible odour obliged him to cover it over again. Blowflies and\r\nothers, which are in the habit of resorting to such substances, seek\r\nout these flowers in great numbers and lay their eggs upon them. In\r\nso doing they carry the pollen.\r\n\r\nThere are certain fungi which have quite as horrible a smell, and\r\nsome of them also resemble decaying animal matter. These are most\r\neagerly sought out by the same blow-and other flies (bright green\r\nlucilias, yellow-brown scatophagas, bluebottles, etc.). But in the\r\ncase of these fungi it is the spores, not pollen, which is carried by\r\nthe insect.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this flowery sort of life is abundantly evident in\r\nthe structure of the insects themselves. Their mouth has been most\r\nwonderfully modified into a complex sucking apparatus; their legs\r\nhave been transformed to act as pollen-carrying baskets, and the\r\nhabits and tastes of the insects have been modified in the most\r\nextraordinary way.\r\n\r\nPerhaps also the association of bright colours with a very pleasant\r\nsensation--that of a full, satisfying meal--has raised the artistic\r\nsensibilities of butterflies, sunbirds, humming birds, etc. For\r\ncertainly these flower-haunting birds and butterflies are remarkable\r\nfor their brilliant colouring. This has probably been brought about\r\nby the preference of the females for the most brilliantly coloured\r\nmale butterflies and humming birds.\r\n\r\nAt any rate bright reds and blues are common to both bird or insect\r\nand to the flowers that they frequent. But the most curious point of\r\nthis whole question lies in the fact that human beings of all grades,\r\nSouth Sea Islanders, the Ancient Greeks, Peruvians, Japanese, Romans,\r\nas well as the Parisians and Londoners of to-day, appreciate the\r\nbeauty of colouring and grace of form which are so obvious in the\r\nworld of flowers.\r\n\r\nYet man has had nothing whatever to do with the selection of either\r\nthese colours or shapes. Many of those which he considers most\r\nprecious (such as the weird, spotted, and outlandish Orchids of\r\nMadagascar and South America) have very likely scarcely ever been\r\nseen by man at all. It is to the artistic eye of the honey-bee,\r\nbumble-bee, butterfly, and of the humming bird and sunbird, that we\r\nowe these exquisite colours. The grace and beauty of outline probably\r\ndepend upon their perfect symmetry and on the perfect suitability of\r\nevery curve to its purpose.\r\n\r\nTherefore it seems that the eyes of man, whether savage or civilized,\r\nare pleased and comforted by these same colours that delight the\r\nlittle brains of insects and birds.\r\n\r\nThis is indeed a mysterious fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nON UNDERGROUND LIFE\r\n\r\n   Mother-earth--Quarries and Chalk-pits--Wandering atoms--The\r\n   soil or dirt--Populations of Worms, Birds, Germs--Fairy\r\n   Rings--Roots miles long--How roots find their way--How they\r\n   do the right thing and seek only what is good for them--Root\r\n   versus stones--Roots which haul bulbs about--Bishopsweed--Wild\r\n   Garlic--Dandelion, Plantain--Solomon's Seal--Roots throwing down\r\n   walls--Strength of a seedling root.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word \"Adam\" means red earth. Poets and essayists still regularly\r\nwrite about Mother-Earth and, in so doing, admit one of the most\r\ninteresting and wonderful facts in Nature.\r\n\r\nIf you go to some quarry or cliff where a section has been cut,\r\nlaying bare the original rock below; then (with Hugh Miller) you may\r\nreflect on the extraordinary value of those few inches of soil which\r\nsupport the growth of all our trees and of all our cultivated plants.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that plant-roots _never_ go deeper than about thirty\r\nfeet. All our food, our energy, and activity depend therefore on this\r\nthinnest surface-layer of an earth which is 8000 miles in diameter.\r\nBut in most places the depth of true soil is far less than thirty\r\nfeet, generally it is not more than thirty inches, and by far the\r\nmost valuable part of it is a very thin layer five or six inches\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nIt is in this true soil that the roots gain their nourishment, and\r\nnot only roots, for whole populations of worms, of germs, of\r\ninsects, even of birds and the higher animals, live upon it. To\r\nit return the dead leaves, the bodies of dead insects, and waste\r\nproducts of all kinds. Within it, they are broken to pieces and\r\nworked up again by the roots of other plants in order to form\r\nnew leaves, new insects, and food for bird and beast. Just as in\r\nengine-works, you may see old engines, wheels, and scrap-iron being\r\nsmashed into pieces; they are melted down and again worked up into\r\nengines of some improved design.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THRASHING CORN IN CHILE\r\n\r\n  Mares are driven at the gallop round the circle, and so beat the\r\n  corn out of the ear with their hoofs. They do this for twenty\r\n  minutes at a time, and are then made to go the other way round.]\r\n\r\nOn a chalk-cliff, which dates from the long-distant Cretaceous\r\nperiod, the entire thickness formed by the yearly work of plants for\r\nmillions and millions of years is often less than a foot in depth,\r\nand probably only four to five inches are true soil.\r\n\r\nBut this is an exceptionally thin stratum, although it is capable of\r\nproducing rich turf, fat snails, and excellent mutton. In peat-mosses\r\nand in those buried forests which form the coalfields, vegetable\r\nmatter may accumulate in deposits of thirty feet of coal. Yet these\r\nstores of carbonaceous matter seem to be at first sight miserly and\r\nselfish, at least from a vegetable point of view.\r\n\r\nThey resemble the gold and silver withdrawn from circulation in the\r\nworld by some Hindoo miser and buried deep within the earth. Yet\r\nsomebody is pretty certain to find out and make use of such stores\r\neventually.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the peat and coalfields, an animal of sufficient\r\nintelligence to utilize them has already been produced, and now they\r\nare used by man as fuel.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to remember that the soil is a sort of last home\r\nto which the particles of carbon, of nitrate, and minerals always\r\nreturn after their wanderings in the bodies of plants, of insects, or\r\nof other animals. They probably rest but a short time before they\r\nagain set off on new adventures.\r\n\r\nOne might say the same of the water, and of the carbonic acid gas\r\nand oxygen of the atmosphere, for the water, falling as rain upon\r\nthe earth, trickles down to the underground water-level. Then it\r\nimmediately begins to rise up between the particles of earth and is\r\npromptly caught and sucked in by the roots, only to be again given\r\nout by their leaves. The carbonic acid gas and oxygen also are always\r\nentering and leaving the foliage. Even the nitrogen of the air is not\r\nleft alone in the atmosphere. There are small germs in the soil which\r\nare able to get hold of it and make it into valuable nitrates.\r\n\r\nMore curious still is the fact that electric charges can be used\r\nto change the comparatively useless air-nitrogen into useful\r\nmanures. Probably the farmer will some day make his own nitrates by\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the soil or earth is a most interesting and romantic\r\npart of botany. It is true that a \"radical\" disposition is necessary\r\nif one is to go to the root of the matter, but, unless we do this, it\r\nis impossible to realize the romance of roots.\r\n\r\nDown below is the unaltered rock, sand, or clay. Next above it comes\r\nthe subsoil, which consists of fragments of the rock below, or of\r\nsand, clay, etc., more or less altered by deep-going roots. Even in\r\nthis subsoil, bacteria or germs may be at work, and the burrows of\r\nworms and insects often extend to it. Next above the subsoil comes\r\nthe true soil; there is plenty of the stones, soil, sand, or whatever\r\nit may be that constitutes the subsoil, but its richness consists\r\nin its contents of valuable minerals, and especially of broken-up\r\nleaves, corpses of insects, and manure. Above this true soil are\r\nfirst the leaf-mould of two years ago, then that of the year before\r\nlast, and _on the top_ is the leaf-mould and other decayed products\r\nof last winter.\r\n\r\nAll these upper layers are full of life and activity, which probably\r\ngoes on vigorously all the year round.\r\n\r\nThe population of worms is especially important. The worm is a\r\nvoracious and gluttonous creature: it is for ever swallowing bits\r\nof leaves and rich soil. Inside its body there are lime-glands\r\nwhich act upon the vegetable food and improve its quality as\r\nmanure. The worm comes up to the surface at night or early morning\r\nand leaves the worm-casts upon it. The rain then washes the rich,\r\nfinely-divided matter of the casts down into the soil again. It is\r\nsaid that there are about 160,000 worms at work in an acre of good\r\nsoil. Yet their life is full of danger. A keen-eyed population of\r\nblackbirds, thrushes, starlings, peewits (plover), and partridges\r\nare always watching for and preying upon the poor worm. Even in his\r\nburrows, which may be six feet deep, he is not safe, for the mole\r\n(_moudiewarp_) is also both very hungry and very active, and delights\r\nin eating him.\r\n\r\nIn the soil also and even deeper in the subsoil are many insects;\r\nsome hibernate in the winter, and at other times actively gnaw the\r\nroots of plants or devour dead leaves and twigs (see Chapter xxiii.).\r\nThus there are many burrows and holes, so that there is no want of\r\nair in the soil, which is indeed necessary both for these creatures\r\nand also for the roots of the plants.\r\n\r\nRain comes down through the soil, carrying with it carbonic acid,\r\nmineral salts, and also germs or bacteria, which form perhaps the\r\nmost important population of all.\r\n\r\nNo work could be carried on without their help; it is bacteria which,\r\nat every stage of decay, assist in breaking up leaves, twigs,\r\ninsects' bodies, worm-casts, and other manures. The way in which they\r\nwork is too difficult to explain here, but to get an idea of the\r\nromance of the underground world one must try to picture to oneself\r\nthese swarms and myriads of germs and bacteria all incessantly and\r\nbusily engaged at their several duties. In the uppermost layers there\r\nare probably in a single cubic inch of good soil from 54,000,000 to\r\n400,000,000 of these microbes. Many are absolutely necessary to the\r\nharvest; a few may be of little importance, but there are sure to be\r\nsome of those dangerous sorts which might devastate a continent with\r\ndisease in a single summer.\r\n\r\nThere are also quantities of other fungi. The fairy rings which one\r\nsees year after year in widening circles of bright, fresh green\r\nare the work, not of fairy footsteps, but of an underground fungus\r\n(_Marasmius oreades_ and others). Its threads are thin, white, and\r\ndelicate; they attack the roots of grasses, etc., on the outer side\r\nof the ring. It is therefore on this outer side yellow, dry, and more\r\nor less withered. On the inner side, however, the grass is luxuriant\r\nand of a rich bright green. Here the fungus has died off, and its\r\nremains, as well as those of the plants which it destroyed, form a\r\nrich manure for the new grass following on its track. Every year\r\nthe ring widens; at a certain time in summer one sees the irregular\r\nline of mushroom-like fungi which are formed by the destructive\r\nunderground absorbing threads. This, however, is but one of the\r\nunderground fungi. There are many kinds; some are useful, others are\r\nvery destructive.\r\n\r\nUpon the upper surface of the soil there falls not only rain, but\r\nanother sort of rain consisting of seeds, dead leaves, insects'\r\nbodies, fungus spores, bacteria, and dust.\r\n\r\nEvery year when the ploughman turns the sod there is a revolution in\r\nthe whole of these populations.\r\n\r\nSo far nothing has been said about the roots themselves, which\r\npenetrate, explore, and exploit all these layers of dead leaves,\r\nsoil, and subsoil.\r\n\r\nThe length of roots produced is very much greater than any one would\r\nsuppose. A one-year-old Scotch fir seedling when grown in sand\r\nproduced in a season a total length (branches, etc.) of no less than\r\nthirty-six feet of root. The total surface of this root system was\r\nestimated to be about twenty-three square inches. This little Scotch\r\nfir after six months' growth was laying under contribution a cone of\r\nearth twenty to thirty inches deep and with a surface of 222 square\r\ninches. In certain kinds of corn the same author estimated the total\r\nlength of the roots as from 1500 to 1800 feet. S. Clark estimated the\r\nlength of the roots of a large cucumber plant as amounting to 25,000\r\nyards (fifteen miles), and made out that it was occupying a whole\r\ncubic yard of ground.\r\n\r\nClover roots are said to go down to depths of six or nine feet, but\r\nmany weeds go deeper still. Coltsfoot, for instance, may be found,\r\naccording to a friend of mine, living at a depth of twenty spades. In\r\nEgypt and other places the roots of acacias go down to twenty feet or\r\neven further, so that they can tap the water supplies, which are at a\r\ngreat depth.\r\n\r\nBut a still more extraordinary fact is the manner in which the\r\nroot-branches arrange to grow in such a way that they search every\r\npart of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe main root in many plants grows straight down, or as nearly as it\r\ncan do so. Its branches are inclined downwards at a quite definite\r\nangle which is often 30°-45° to the surface. Moreover, these branches\r\ncome off in quite a regular way. Each keeps growing in its own\r\nspecial direction to the east, south-east, or west, or whatever it\r\nmay be, of its parent root.\r\n\r\nHave they some extraordinary sense of the direction of the points\r\nof the compass? It is said that if a side root, which is growing,\r\nsay for instance downwards and westwards, is turned in some other\r\ndirection, it will after a time resume its original westerly voyage.\r\nThis fact is a most extraordinary one, if true, but it can scarcely\r\nbe said that it has been proved, and, as will be shown later, there\r\nare other curious facts in the behaviour of roots which might explain\r\nthe experiment without assuming that roots know the points of the\r\ncompass.\r\n\r\nIf one cuts a branch of willow and plants it upside down in the\r\nearth, it will very likely take root and grow. Its appearance will\r\nbe most extraordinary, for the roots will grow downwards, whilst the\r\nbranches, instead of growing in the direction of the old branches,\r\nturn round and grow upwards.[34]\r\n\r\n  [34] Kerner and Oliver, _l.c._, vol. 1, p. 88.\r\n\r\nWhy do roots generally grow downwards? The fact is so familiar that\r\nthe difficulty of answering does not, at first sight, seem so great\r\nas it really is.\r\n\r\nPfeffer, the great physiologist, has the following interesting\r\ncomparison. Suppose a man is trying to find his way in the dark, then\r\na single lingering ray of light gives him an impulse to walk towards\r\nit.[35] So our root, also in the dark, feels the pull of gravity and\r\nendeavours to grow downwards. Others have compared the direction of\r\ngravity to the sailor's compass, and suppose that the root is guided\r\nin the same sort of way.\r\n\r\n  [35] _Annals of Botany_, 1904.\r\n\r\nBut a young, vigorous root making or forcing its way in darkness\r\nthrough stones and heavy earth is a most interesting and fascinating\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nThere are the most extraordinary coincidences in its behaviour. It\r\nhas the property of always doing exactly the right thing in any\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nIt is of course intended to keep below the ground and in the dark.\r\nSo we find that if roots are uncovered, they will turn away from the\r\nlight and burrow into the earth again. They avoid light just as a\r\nworm would do.\r\n\r\nRoots are of course intended to absorb or suck in water. If there is\r\na drain in the soil or a place where water collects, the roots will\r\ngrow towards that place. Very often they form a dense spongy mass of\r\nfibres which may almost choke the drain. Along a riverside one can\r\noften find great fibrous masses of tree roots near the water. But how\r\ndoes the root learn that the water is there and turn away from its\r\noriginal track to find it? It certainly does so!\r\n\r\nThen again, Herr Lilienfeld has recently shown that roots seem able\r\nto turn away from poisonous materials in the soil and to seek out and\r\ngrow towards valuable and nutritious substances. He found that peas,\r\nbeans, sunflower, and other roots were very sensitive to different\r\nsubstances in the soil, and were directly attracted by what was good\r\nfor them and turned aside from what was unwholesome.\r\n\r\nThis property and the power of growing towards water probably explain\r\nthe mysterious sense of direction alluded to above, for roots will\r\ntake a line which has not been exhausted by their neighbours.[36]\r\n\r\n  [36] Lilienfeld, _Beihefte z. Botan. Centralblatt_, Band XIV.,\r\n  abth 1, pp. 131-212. The facts were denied by Newcombe and\r\n  Rhodes, _Bot. Gazette_, 36, 1904.\r\n\r\nBut of all these wonderful properties, the most remarkable is the way\r\nin which roots find their way past stones and other obstacles in the\r\nsoil. They insinuate themselves into winding cracks and crawl round\r\nstones with an ingenuity that makes one wonder if they can possibly\r\nbe without some sort of intelligence.\r\n\r\nIt is the very tip or end of the young root that seems to be\r\nresponsible; for if, in the course of its journeyings underground, it\r\nshould strike a stone or something hard, the root does not grow on\r\nand flatten itself.\r\n\r\nBut some sort of message is sent back from the tip to the growing\r\npart which is a short distance behind it. After this message has\r\nbeen received, the growing part begins to curve sideways, so that\r\nthe tip is brought clear of the obstacle and can probably proceed\r\ntriumphantly upon its way. The inexplicable part is that the growing\r\npart which curves has never been touched at all, but simply answers\r\nto the message from the tip.[37]\r\n\r\n  [37] If the growing part itself touches a stone it curves round\r\n  the stone, not away from it--the reverse of the reaction at the\r\n  tip!\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps the most reasonable and intelligent behaviour found\r\nin the whole vegetable world, and it is not surprising that Darwin\r\ncompared the root-tip to a brain.\r\n\r\nThese extraordinary responses fill one with astonishment, but\r\nthere are others still more interesting and remarkable. It will be\r\nremembered that we have already shown how different the soil is at\r\ndifferent levels. The subsoil, soil, and uppermost layers are all\r\nquite different from one another.\r\n\r\nThis may explain why it is that many plants seem to prefer to develop\r\ntheir roots at one particular depth below the surface. Not only so,\r\nbut they find their own favourite level in the most persevering way.\r\n\r\nIf, for instance, you sow a barley-corn at too great a depth, the\r\nseed germinates and forms a few roots, but it immediately sends out a\r\nstem which grows upwards towards the light. As soon as this stem has\r\nreached the proper place, which is just below the surface, there is\r\nan enormous development of roots, which begin to search and explore\r\ntheir favourite stratum of soil.[38]\r\n\r\n  [38] Pfeffer, _l.c._, p. 139.\r\n\r\nIn some few cases one can see in a dim sort of way the reason for the\r\nlevel which certain plants prefer. Thus the underground stems of the\r\ncommon Thistle, which are very long and fleshy, are found just a few\r\ninches below the level usually reached by plough or spade. This makes\r\nit very difficult to tear them out. Even if grubbers with long spikes\r\nwhich reach as deep as these buried stems are driven through the\r\nground, it generally happens that the stems are only cut in pieces\r\nand not dragged up. These hardy weeds are not much injured by little\r\naccidents of this kind, for each separate bit will form upright\r\nthistle stems next year. In fact if one cuts this fleshy subterranean\r\nrunner of the Thistle into pieces a quarter of an inch long, each\r\npiece will probably become a Thistle.\r\n\r\nSometimes indeed these weeds are carried from one field to another\r\nby pieces of them sticking in the very machines which are used to\r\neradicate them.\r\n\r\nThe Bishopsweed is one of the hardest cases. The writer was once\r\nambitious enough to try to dig up an entire plant of this horrid\r\nweed. The first foot or so revealed no sign of the end of the\r\nbranching runners, and it was not until a hole about four feet deep\r\nand five feet across had been excavated that there was any sign of an\r\nend to the plant.\r\n\r\nWhen it was at last removed, the original deeply buried stem was\r\nfound to give off branches which again branched in a most complicated\r\nmanner, until almost every green shoot of Bishopsweed[39] within a\r\nspace six feet in diameter was seen to be really a branch of this\r\none original plant! So to eradicate the plant it would have been\r\nnecessary to dig over the whole garden to a depth of at least five or\r\nsix feet.\r\n\r\n  [39] This weed is a cure for gout, and seems to have been called\r\n  Bishopsweed because it was supposed that gout was a common\r\n  ailment of bishops!\r\n\r\nHow did the stem get down to such a depth below the surface? This is\r\none of the most curious stories in plant life, and the process which\r\nwe shall now try to describe has only been explained within the last\r\nfew years.[40]\r\n\r\n  [40] By the classical researches of Rimbach.\r\n\r\nThe seed of the Wild Garlic (_Allium ursinum_) lies at first upon the\r\nsurface of the ground, but it is soon buried by a growth of the stalk\r\nof the seed-leaf, which pushes the germ down below the earth. As soon\r\nas it is buried, roots are formed and pass obliquely downwards, where\r\nthey become fixed by forming root-hairs all round themselves. These\r\nroot-hairs round every root hold its tip firmly in the earth; then\r\nthese same roots contract or shorten, which of course hauls down the\r\nroot a little deeper in the earth. One might compare it to a few men\r\nhauling down a balloon by ropes attached to the car. About September\r\nto November, roots of quite a different character are formed; these\r\nexplore the surrounding soil and gather in food and moisture.\r\n\r\nThen the roots rest during the winter, when the buds and young leaves\r\nare being formed. In April the buds begin to push out their leaves\r\nand a new ring of roots appear. These April roots are quite different\r\nfrom the September ones. They again fix themselves firmly and then\r\ncontract, becoming fully a third shorter than they were originally.\r\nThe bulb is dragged down still deeper below the surface. It flowers\r\nin May and fruits in June and July. Then in September the same\r\nseries of operations begins again. The process goes on until the\r\nplant is three to five inches below the ground.\r\n\r\nIt follows from all this, that every year the roots find new ground\r\nto explore and utilize. Nor is the Wild Garlic at all exceptional in\r\nthis respect. A great many plants have roots which contract and drag\r\nthe bulb or stem after them deeper into the earth. Something of the\r\nsame sort happens, for instance, to Bramble branches. They arch or\r\ndroop over, when growing, so that the end touches the earth. On the\r\nunderside of the tip, as soon as it begins to rest on the ground,\r\nroots are formed. These roots make their way into the ground, and\r\nthen, when fixed, they shorten or contract, so that the end of the\r\nbranch is dragged down to a depth of several inches. After this has\r\nhappened the old branch generally dies away, and a young, vigorous\r\nBramble develops from its buried tip.\r\n\r\nRaspberry branches also are often buried; their roots become coiled\r\nor rolled in a very curious manner. The end of the root becomes\r\nfirmly attached in the soil, and then the rest of it revolves like a\r\ntendril so as to draw the stem deeper into the earth.[41]\r\n\r\n  [41] Scott Elliot and Fingland, _Trans. Nat. Hist. Soc. Glasgow_,\r\n  vol. 5, New Series, part ii., 1897-8.\r\n\r\nOn any ordinary roadside in the country one is sure to find the\r\nrosettes of the common Dandelion and of the Rats-tail Plantain\r\n(_Plantago major_). These are two of the most interesting plants in\r\nthe world, although they are vulgarly common. How is it that their\r\nleaves are always at the level of the ground? The stem is always\r\ngrowing upwards; every year fresh circles of leaves are formed above\r\nthe older ones. Yet the crown of the stem is never so much raised up\r\nabove the ground that the toe of a boot would be likely to knock it\r\noff. It is always kept so deep in the earth, that it is by no means\r\neasy to kick or \"howk\" the crown out of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe Dandelion root contracts very strongly at the end of the season,\r\nand by this shortening or contraction keeps its leaves just at the\r\nsoil level. The Plantain sends out about forty to sixty oblique\r\ndownward-growing roots, which fix themselves in the soil by throwing\r\nout branch roots. These forty to sixty roots are at first about ten\r\ninches long, but, as soon as they are firmly attached, they contract,\r\nand pull the stem with its crown of leaves about one-third of an inch\r\ndeeper. This is just enough to keep the leaves flat on the ground and\r\nto prevent any possible injury from passers-by.\r\n\r\nSo that in finding their favourite level in the soil, plants are\r\noften pulled or hauled about by the roots. But they are not always\r\nmoved by the roots. Even though buried in darkness, they seem able in\r\nsome way to tell when they are in the most favourable position.\r\n\r\nEvery gardener knows that Autumn Crocus and other bulbs do not remain\r\nin the same position. They wander below ground in a curious and\r\ninexplicable fashion.\r\n\r\nThe Solomon's Seal has an underground, fleshy stem, which prefers to\r\ngrow at a definite depth. If it is planted close to the surface, then\r\nthe point of the next year's little fleshy bud turns downwards; next\r\nyear it again turns downwards, and so on every year, until the stem\r\nhas reached its proper depth. Then it grows horizontally. Similarly,\r\nif it is planted too deep it grows upwards.\r\n\r\nThus if one wishes to realize the underground life of plants, one\r\nmust picture to oneself:--\r\n\r\n1. The usual descending roots, whose system of branching may be\r\ncompared to the ordinary branching above ground. It is often not\r\nunlike the reflection in water of the tree itself, such as one might\r\nsee on a fine winter's day along the shore of some still lake.\r\n\r\n2. The bold, exploring, horizontal runners of Couchgrass, Thistle,\r\nBishopsweed, etc., vigorously pushing their way at a depth too great\r\nfor the gardener's spade.\r\n\r\n3. All sorts of bulbs, runners, and roots being slowly hauled or\r\ndragged about till they get into exactly the right position, but\r\nnever remaining for two years in exactly the same place. All have\r\ntheir favourite depth[42]--\r\n\r\n  [42] See Rimbach's researches.\r\n\r\n    Herb Paris                        2/3 to 1-3/4 inches deep.\r\n    Solomon's Seal                  1-1/3 to 2-1/3   \"     \"\r\n    Cuckoo Pint (_Arum maculatum_)          2 to 4   \"     \"\r\n    Colchicum (Autumn Crocus)       3-1/3 to 5-1/3   \"     \"\r\n    Asparagus                      6-3/8 to 13-1/8   \"     \"\r\n\r\nThe water evaporating on the surface of the soil must, as it rises\r\nfrom the permanent water-level below, pass the gauntlet of all\r\nthese thirsty rootlets and their hairs. Tree-roots will be ready to\r\nintercept it at ten feet depth, many herbaceous plants will suck it\r\nin at depths of five to six feet, and in the upper layers of soil it\r\nwill have to pass root-system after root-system from Asparagus to\r\nParis, so that very little will be lost.\r\n\r\nPerhaps of more importance are the bacteria-germs, and dissolved\r\nmineral salts in the rainwater as it trickles down from the surface.\r\nThe soil particle acts as a filter: at every inch of the descent some\r\nof the bacteria and salts will be left, so that by the time the level\r\nof Asparagus has been reached there will be exceedingly few, and the\r\nwater is comparatively speaking pure. The effect of this vigorous\r\nunderground life is often visible on the surface. Roots, and\r\nparticularly tree-roots, are often extraordinarily strong. Kerner, in\r\nhis invaluable _Natural History of Plants_, has a beautiful picture\r\nof a young larch tree which had grown in a fissure of a huge boulder.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to grow, the root had forced up part of this stone. It\r\nwas estimated that it had lifted a weight of 3000 lb., though it was\r\nonly some ten inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nAlong a dry-stone wall, or even near houses, the growth of tree-roots\r\nvery often damages the entire wall, which may be entirely overthrown\r\nif the tree is too near. The force of the growth of the roots is so\r\ngreat that even a six-foot stone wall cannot keep them down.\r\n\r\nQuite a young seedling root, in forcing itself through the soil, may\r\nexercise a pressure of two-thirds to four-fifths of a pound!\r\n\r\nThis is of course necessary, if one remembers that it has to drive\r\nitself through the earth, pushing aside and compressing the earth\r\nparticles along its course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nHIGH MOUNTAINS, ARCTIC SNOWS\r\n\r\n   The life of a cherry tree--Cherries in March--Flowering of\r\n   gorse--Chickweed's descendants--Forest fires in Africa--Spring\r\n   passing from Italy to the frozen North--Life in the\r\n   Arctic--Dwarfs--Snow-melting soldanellas--Highland Arctic-Alpine\r\n   plants--Their history--Arctic Britain--Edelweiss--An Alpine\r\n   garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to understand and very difficult to explain the sort\r\nof life and consciousness which is enjoyed by plants.\r\n\r\nThat they do live is obvious; we know instinctively that they enjoy\r\nfine weather in summer and gentle showers in spring, but we cannot\r\nprove it.\r\n\r\nMuch of a plant's life is concealed and hidden from us. Even the few\r\nexplanations which have been given by certain observers are by no\r\nmeans generally accepted.\r\n\r\nThis is true even as regards the case of the Cherry tree, which\r\nhas been experimented with, and fought over and argued about by\r\nbotanists, and yet we only know a very little about its inner life.\r\n\r\nWhen the leaves fall in autumn, next season's buds are already formed\r\nand are then about one-eighth of their full size. At this time the\r\ntree contains enormous quantities of food-stores, for the whole\r\nseason's work of the leaves has been accumulating until this moment.\r\nDuring the long winter's \"sleep\" the tree is by no means at rest. It\r\nis arranging and packing up those stores in the safest place and in\r\nthe most convenient form.\r\n\r\nJust as a bear, before it retires to sleep during the winter, takes\r\ncare to get as fat as possible, so the Cherry turns its starch to\r\nfat, and stores it away in the innermost and least exposed parts of\r\nthe tree, that is in the central wood. As soon as the winter ends,\r\nand indeed _before_ it has ended, preparations are beginning for the\r\ngreat moment of the year. For weeks there is a slow, gradual, almost\r\nimperceptible growth of the buds, then they develop with a rush,\r\nand in six to ten days double or treble their weight. Then comes\r\nthe supreme moment, for the flower-buds suddenly burst open and the\r\nCherry is in active and vigorous bloom and covered all over with\r\nexquisite blossoms. All last year's fats and starches are rapidly\r\nused up. Very soon the young leaves are beginning to make sugar and\r\nother food, which give some help during the ripening of the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe flowers are actively at work. One of our usual misconceptions\r\nas to the nature of a flower is that it is an emblem of peace, of\r\nrestful enjoyment, of serene contemplation of its own beauty. That is\r\nvery far from being the truth. The petals are actively, vigorously\r\nworking. If one could take the pulse of a petal, which shows the\r\nrapidity of its breathing, one would find that it is twice as fast as\r\nthat of the leaf. The work of changing water into vapour and pouring\r\nit out goes on three times as quickly in the petals (as compared\r\nwith the leaves). Moreover their temperature is higher, and often\r\ndistinctly above that of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis feverish activity of the flowers themselves is matched by\r\nthe hurrying crowds of excited and exhilarated insects which are\r\nsearching every blossom.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the Japanese Prime Minister, in the midst of their\r\ngreat and famous war, invited the whole cabinet to spend an afternoon\r\nwatching the cherry trees in bloom!\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & Underwood_\r\n  _London & New York_\r\n\r\n  WISTARIA IN KAMAIDO PARK, JAPAN]\r\n\r\nFrom the blossom of the springtime all through summer and autumn\r\nfollows one continuous spell of hard work. Day after day an endless\r\nstream of food is entering the stem; night after night it is\r\ncondensed and arranged and repacked, until, when the leaves fall, the\r\nperiod of slow and quiet preparation begins again.\r\n\r\nUnder certain conditions it is possible for gardeners to modify the\r\nlife of a cherry, and to make it bloom much earlier, but this is only\r\npossible within well-defined limits. It is no use trying to force it\r\nto bloom before January. It _must_ have a quiet time after summer.\r\nBut by beginning in January and by very carefully managing the\r\ntemperature, it can be made to produce fruit quite early in the year.\r\n\r\nThe following account is given to show how very carefully gardeners\r\nhave to work when they upset the ordinary course of Nature's events.\r\nThe plant is taken into a greenhouse, and the temperature kept as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                                      Day           Night\r\n                                  Temperature.

The account is based on the\r\n  works of Pynaert, Sachs, Askenasy, etc.\r\n\r\nMost flowers have very much the same general history as the cherry,\r\nbut it must not be supposed that they are all alike. The differences\r\nare very interesting and curious.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, plants of our common Gorse, furze, or whin may\r\nbe found in bloom at almost every season of the year. There are at\r\nleast four seasons when there is that tremendous display of golden\r\nblossom which made the great Linnæus fall on his knees and burst into\r\ntears. These are about the 22nd March, 24th May, 15th August, and\r\n21st November; yet there are enough odd flowers blooming in almost\r\nevery month to give some cause for the saying, \"The gorse is out\r\nof bloom when kissing is out of favour.\" The last practice, though\r\nuncleanly and dangerous, not only on general grounds, but on account\r\nof bacterial germs which may be transferred, has been authoritatively\r\ncondemned in the United States, but it is still more or less popular\r\nin other countries at all seasons.\r\n\r\nThe Chickweed and some other of our annual weeds show a hardy\r\ndisregard of climate. Its seeds germinate and grow at any time, so\r\nthat flowers and seeds can be formed whenever there is a spell of\r\nfavourable weather. Now one chickweed can produce 3000 seeds. Suppose\r\nthat there are only five generations in the year, which is a very low\r\nestimate. Then one seed of chickweed might produce 3000 × 3000 × 3000\r\n× 3000 individuals in one season!\r\n\r\nOther plants show much the same tendency. In fine warm autumns\r\na great many annuals bloom a second time. It is on record that\r\nforty-four spring species bloomed in one warm November. At the Cape\r\nand in other warm climates many of our annuals do not die at the end\r\nof autumn, but go on growing. They become perennial.\r\n\r\nIt is even possible to make a Tree Mignonette by pinching off the\r\nflower-buds, though this plant is usually an annual.\r\n\r\nIn fact plants are not absolutely confined to one rigid scheme,\r\nbut they can alter and modify their blooming time if they find it\r\nconvenient to do so. In the Mediterranean some blossom in early\r\nspring and others in late autumn, whilst in the dry, hot, and dusty\r\nsummer very few flower.\r\n\r\nIn Central Africa during the dry season forest fires are by no means\r\nrare. The trees are scattered, and the ground is only covered by\r\ndried and withered grasses and sedges. One sees in the distance a\r\nrolling cloud of smoke, and soon one comes to a line of flame. It is\r\nnot dangerous, not even very impressive, for a jump of three feet\r\ncarries you over the flame and on to a desolate wilderness of black\r\ncinders, out of which stand up the scorched trunks and half-burnt\r\nbranches of gaunt, naked trees. A day or two afterwards, bright blue\r\nand white and yellow flowers break out of those scorched branches and\r\nalso from the ground.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand why this happens, but certainly it\r\nis good for the flowers, which can be seen by insects from a long\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nBut these are unusual cases. Generally the warm breath of spring\r\nwakes up the bulbs and buds, and one after another has its moment of\r\nflowering.\r\n\r\nSpring travels towards the North Pole at an average rate of four\r\nmiles a day.\r\n\r\nA pedestrian visiting Italy in the end of January might follow the\r\nspring northwards, and if he wished to accompany it all the way, it\r\nwould be quite possible to do so without exceeding an ordinary day's\r\nmarch. He would have to reach North Germany by the end of March,\r\nSweden in May, and by the end of June and July would find spring\r\nbeginning in the desolate Arctic regions.\r\n\r\nOf course the presence of mountains would make this tour a little\r\ndifficult and devious, but still it is quite a possible undertaking.\r\nIt would be very interesting, for he would be able to watch the cold\r\nand frost and chilliness of winter disappearing as the sun's rays\r\nthaw out a greater and greater extent of the cold and frozen North.\r\n\r\nThe life of an Arctic plant is truly set in the midst of many and\r\ngreat dangers.\r\n\r\nFor 250 days the ground is hard frozen and the temperature _never_\r\nabove the freezing-point. About the end of May it begins to rise\r\na little, but the plant has to crowd the whole of its life, its\r\nflowers, fruits, and seeds, into the space of two months!\r\n\r\nAbout the 23rd to the 29th June the first flower appears, then\r\nfollows strong, active growth in uninterrupted sunshine during July\r\nand August. The flowers are brilliant in colour and richly produced.\r\nThe tiny dwarf Arctic plants are covered all over with blue or golden\r\nyellow or white blossoms. All is in full activity and luxuriance.\r\nThen suddenly, in a night, the icy grasp of winter falls upon them.\r\n\r\nHard-frozen flowers, buds, and ripening fruits remain chilled and\r\nincapable of life from the 30th August until the end of May.\r\n\r\nOf course, under such conditions, these hardy and vigorous little\r\nplants cannot become trees or shrubs. To show the effect of the\r\nclimate upon them, a few British plants which are also Arctic may be\r\ncompared.\r\n\r\n                                           In              In the\r\n                                     Great Britain.

It is often\r\nnot more than six weeks, yet in that short time the rich blue of the\r\nGentian, the Alpine Roses, Soldanellas, Campanulas, and many others\r\nmake some of these grass slopes high up in the mountains a perfect\r\ngarden of loveliness.\r\n\r\nSometimes in passing over the snowfields of Switzerland just before\r\nspring, one notices the pretty violet flowers of the Soldanella\r\nswaying to and fro in the wind above the unmelted snow. One does\r\noccasionally see in this country the Snowdrop in the midst of snow,\r\nbut then it has fallen after the Snowdrop had blossomed.\r\n\r\nThe Alpine Soldanella flowers whilst the earth is still covered. It\r\nbegins as soon as the ground below the snow is thawed. Each little\r\ndeveloping flower-stalk melts out a grotto in the snow above itself,\r\nand so bores, thawing its way up into the air above. It has already\r\nbeen mentioned that, inside a flower, the temperature is often higher\r\nthan the surrounding air. It is this higher temperature of the flower\r\nwhich thaws a little dome or grotto in the snow above the head of\r\nthe flower.[44] When a flock of sheep are covered by a snowdrift,\r\na similar hollow is formed above them by their breath and the high\r\ntemperature of their bodies: they often seem indeed to be little or\r\nnone the worse for being buried. The Soldanella melts its way in just\r\nthe same manner.\r\n\r\n  [44] Kerner, _Natural History of Plants_ (Blackie), vol. 1, p.\r\n  468.\r\n\r\nIn this country we have no such magnificent chain of mountains as\r\nthe Alps, and yet we find on the Scotch and Welsh mountains quite a\r\nnumber of real alpines.\r\n\r\nThere are, for instance, such flowers as Sea-pink (_Armeria_), Sea\r\nPlantain (_Plantago maritima_), Scurvy-grass, and others, which\r\ncan be found on windy, desolate gullies and corries high up on the\r\nHighland hills, and which also occur on the sea-coast, but _never\r\nbetween the seashore and the tops of the mountains_. You might search\r\nevery field, every moor, and every riverside throughout the country,\r\nbut you would not discover those three plants anywhere between the\r\nseashore and the summits.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it seems quite impossible to explain why this should\r\nbe the case. But all those three plants are found in the Arctic\r\nregions, and the explanation is in reality quite simple.\r\n\r\nAt one time the shores of England and Scotland formed part of the\r\nArctic regions. Ice and snow covered the hills and mountains;\r\nhuge glaciers occupied the valleys and flowed over the lowlands,\r\nplastering the low grounds with clay which they dragged underneath\r\nthem, and polishing and scratching any exposed rocks.\r\n\r\nWhen the ice began to melt away and left free \"berg battered beaches\"\r\nand \"boulder-hatched hills,\" Lincolnshire and Yorkshire must have\r\nbeen like the Antarctic regions in those days. This is how Dr. Louis\r\nBernacchi describes the Antarctic continent:--\r\n\r\n\"The scene before us looked inexpressibly desolate.... No token of\r\nvitality anywhere, nothing to be seen on the steep slopes of the\r\nmountains but rock and ice.... Gravel and pebbles were heaped up in\r\nmounds and ridges. In some places these ridges coalesced so as to\r\nform basin-shaped hollows. Bleached remains of thousands of penguins\r\nwere scattered all over the platform, mostly young birds that had\r\nsuccumbed to the severity of the climate.\"\r\n\r\nGreat Britain must have been just as savage and desolate when\r\nthese hardy little Arctic plants colonized the shingles and rooted\r\nthemselves amongst the rocks.\r\n\r\nThey covered not only the seashore, but they probably made a\r\nsettlement wherever rock or land of any kind was exposed. These\r\noriginal settlers have had three bands of descendants. One band has\r\nremained ever since on the seashore of Great Britain; another set\r\ngradually travelled northwards. As the ice melted away, leaving\r\nthe land bare, first in Denmark, then in Norway, and finally in\r\nGreenland, this second set followed it, until now we find them far to\r\nthe northward, populating the Arctic regions of to-day just as they\r\ndid those of Britain in the Great Ice Age.\r\n\r\nThe third set of descendants would at first cover all the land and\r\nrocks of the lower hills and valleys near the sea; then as the ice\r\nand snow melted and exposed the higher mountain sides, they would\r\nclimb the hills and eventually reach the exposed summits where they\r\nare now living. There they find themselves in an impossible, savage\r\nsort of climate, in which they alone are able to exist. Violent\r\nstorms, drenching mist, scorching sunshine (when the rocks become\r\nso hot that it is almost impossible to touch them), rainstorms and\r\nmonths of snow and hard frost, cannot kill Scurvy-grass, Seathrift,\r\nor Plantain, but there are few other plants which can stand such\r\nconditions. Lower down on the flanks of the hills and in the valleys,\r\nthey have long since been dispossessed of the rich and fertile lands\r\nby plants which can grow more rapidly and luxuriantly.\r\n\r\nThe little Alpine Creeping and Least Willows, for instance, some of\r\nwhich get up to 3980 feet in Breadalbane, are mere dwarfs only a few\r\ninches high, and totally different from their allies in the fertile\r\nlowlands, which are trees eighty to ninety feet high.\r\n\r\nSome of the Alpine plants which also occur in the Arctic regions have\r\nnot even been able to survive by the seaside in Great Britain. Their\r\nnearest allies are in the Norwegian mountains.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible even for shrubs to stand the violent winds and\r\nsnowstorms of these summits. Alpine plants are generally low-growing\r\nmats. They are also often clothed all over in cottonwool, such as the\r\nEdelweiss. This probably keeps them from losing too much water during\r\nthe dry season, when the rocks on which they grow are strongly heated\r\nby the sunlight.\r\n\r\nYet, like the Arctic plants, they have rich, deep, and brilliant\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\nA queer point is that they have got so accustomed to this stormy and\r\nperilous existence that it is extremely difficult to grow them in a\r\ngarden. Like mountaineers, they dwindle and pine away in the richer\r\nsoil and softer air of the low grounds.\r\n\r\nTo make an Alpine garden, rocks and stones must be arranged with\r\npockets and hollows, like natural crevices and basins, between them.\r\nRich leaf-mould must be placed in these hollows. There must be good\r\ndrainage, and as much sunlight as one can possibly get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSCRUB\r\n\r\n   Famous countries which were covered by it--Trees which are\r\n   colonizing the desert--Acacia scrub in East Africa, game and\r\n   lions--Battle between acacia and camels, etc.--Australian\r\n   half-deserts--Explorers' fate--Queen Hatasu and the first\r\n   geographical expedition recorded--Frankincense, myrrh, gums, and\r\n   odorous resins--Manna--Ladanum--Burning bush--Olives, oranges,\r\n   and perfume farms--Story of roses--Bulgarian attar of roses--How\r\n   pomade is made--Cutting down of forests and Mohammed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA scrub or Half-desert does not seem at first sight to be in the\r\nleast interesting.\r\n\r\nBut if one remembers such places as Cordoba, Seville, Florence,\r\nGenoa, Sicily, Athens, Constantinople, the great cities of Ephesus,\r\nCorinth, etc., of St. Paul's Epistles, Persia, Arabia, Palestine, and\r\nCarthage, surely the countries which have had such splendid histories\r\ndeserve a chapter to themselves. What achievements in war, in art, in\r\nliterature, and in romance are connected with these lands bordering\r\nthe Mediterranean or fringing the great deserts of Sahara and central\r\nAsia!\r\n\r\nThe animals which belong to such country are also interesting. It\r\nis the home of the camel, ass, horse, donkey, not to speak of the\r\ngiraffe, rhinoceros, gazelle, antelope, zebra, lion, and hyena.\r\n\r\nThe plants are full of interest too, and some of them are of great\r\nimportance to man. The Olive, Orange, Fig, Roses, and many perfumes\r\nand spice-trees, are natives of scrub. In fact, it is the real centre\r\nof all gums, frankincenses, and myrrhs.\r\n\r\nAs man depends upon plants and animals, and as animals also are\r\ndependent on the plant world, it is the climate which really is\r\nresponsible for everything.\r\n\r\nThe world of plants is entirely and exactly regulated by the\r\ncharacter of the climate. What, then, is the climate of scrub?\r\n\r\nThose countries enjoy brilliant sunshine, cloudless skies, and yet\r\nthere is sufficient rain to permit of irrigation and to prevent\r\nthe unmitigated desolation of the desert. When, as has happened in\r\nmany of these famous lands, the forests have been cut down and the\r\naqueducts have been neglected, they become arid, dry, and almost\r\nuseless. But when carefully and industriously worked, as they were in\r\nthe days of Greece, Carthage, and Rome, they produce results which\r\nwill for ever live in the history of the world.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of such half-desert climates and of the scrub which\r\ncovers them has been already suggested.\r\n\r\nThe scrub is trying to occupy the desert.\r\n\r\nIf one takes the sternwheel steamer at the First Cataract of the\r\nNile and passes southwards, the desolation of black rock and\r\n\"honey-coloured\" sand of the Libyan Desert is at first unbroken.\r\nBut here and there the thorny trees of the \"Seyal\". Acacia show\r\nthe beginnings of a scrub region. Much further to the south, those\r\nacacias and others become great forests which extend all along the\r\nsouth of the Sahara Desert and furnish the valuable gums of the\r\nSoudan.\r\n\r\nIf one passes southward through this forest of acacias, it alters in\r\ncharacter. The trees become taller, closer together, and climbing\r\nplants and undergrowth become more frequent. Still further south,\r\none finds the regular tropical forest which is characteristic of the\r\ntropics everywhere.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Photo G. F._\r\n\r\n  GATHERING OLIVES IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting part, which is also the richest in big game, is\r\nthe intermediate zone between the desert and the acacia forest or\r\nscrub.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of transitions are found. Sometimes there are thickets of\r\nthorny bushes. Occasionally scattered clumps of woodland alternate\r\nwith stretches of grass or what looks like grass. Near the desert one\r\nfinds pioneer acacias dotted singly here and there; these are the\r\nscouts or skirmishers of the army of trees which is trying to occupy\r\nand colonize the desert.\r\n\r\nThis explains why this sort of scrub occurs in so many parts of the\r\nworld. On the European side of the Mediterranean, the dry climate\r\nof Spain, the Riviera, and Greece must no doubt at one time have\r\nsupported a scrub vegetation. At present it is difficult to tell what\r\nthis was. There is a sort of scrub called _Maqui_ which covers parts\r\nespecially of Corsica and other Mediterranean countries. In Greece,\r\nalso, thorny, woody little bushes are very common.\r\n\r\nBut these are just what the goats, who are fiends from a vegetable\r\npoint of view, have been unable to destroy. We cannot tell what sort\r\nof country revealed itself to the first Phoenicians when they landed\r\nin Southern Spain to traffic with the savage inhabitants, or what met\r\nthe eyes of Ulysses when he made his great voyage to unknown lands.\r\n\r\nBut there are places in the world where man has never either kept\r\ndomestic animals or cultivated the soil. Possibly Spain and Sicily in\r\nthose early days were not unlike parts of British East Africa, such\r\nas the Taru Desert between Mombasa and Kibwezi.\r\n\r\nThe following may give an idea of how this scrub or desert appeared\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nGnarled and twisted acacias of all sorts and sizes, usually with\r\nbright white bark and a thin, naked appearance, cover the whole\r\ncountry. Amongst these one finds the curious _trees_ of Euphorbia.\r\nIn Britain Euphorbias are little green uninteresting weeds, but\r\nhere some of them are twenty to thirty feet high, with many slender\r\nwhip-like branches, but no leaves. Others are exactly like Cactus,\r\nand take on weird, candelabra-like shapes. Nobody meddles with\r\nthem for, if the slightest cut is made in the bark, out pours an\r\nacrid, white milk which raises painful blisters, and may even cause\r\nblindness if a drop touches the eyes.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the plants are either covered with thorns or protected by\r\nresins, gums, or poisonous secretions.\r\n\r\nBetween the scrubby trees the soil is dotted over by little tufts\r\nof grass or sedge, but these are so far apart that the tint of the\r\nlandscape is that of the soil.\r\n\r\nGame is abundant everywhere. Sometimes it is a small bustard or\r\na persistent, raucous guinea-fowl that affords a chance for a\r\ngood dinner. Occasionally a tiny gazelle, the \"paa,\" with large\r\nears, springs out of the thorns and vanishes down the path. I saw\r\nfootprints of giraffes, and came across ostriches more than once. I\r\nalso made a persevering attempt to slay a Clarke's gazelle, an animal\r\nwith enormous ears and a long thin neck.[45]\r\n\r\n  [45] _Naturalist in Mid-Africa._\r\n\r\nThese long-necked creatures can see far above the usual short thorny\r\nbush, and it is exceeding difficult to get near them. Water probably\r\nexists under the stony grit soil, but at present one has to be\r\ncontented with that found in the stagnant pools at Taru, Maungu,\r\netc., which, if not occupied by the decaying remains of a dead\r\nantelope, are, as a rule, drinkable.[46]\r\n\r\n  [46] _Naturalist in Mid-Africa._\r\n  These acacias are quite well fitted to live in this dry and arid\r\n  region. Their roots go down to twenty feet or more, so as to reach\r\n  the deep-seated water supplies.\r\n\r\nTheir leaves are generally adapted to resist any injury from the\r\nstrong glare of the sunshine. The gums, already alluded to, are also\r\nvery important, for any crack or break in the tree is promptly gummed\r\nup, and there is no loss of precious water thereby. This gum will\r\nalso prevent or discourage burrowing and boring insects from getting\r\nin; they would, if they tried to do so, become \"flies in amber,\" like\r\nthose found in fossil resin. The trees are generally provided with\r\nstrong spines, which guard them from the many grazing animals which\r\ntry to devour the succulent leaflets.\r\n\r\nThe fight between the grazing animal and the plant is, in these\r\nscrubs and half-deserts, very severe. In Egypt it is said that the\r\nwhole flora has been entirely altered by the camel and the donkey.[47]\r\n\r\n  [47] Floyer.\r\n\r\nBut in this case the battle is unfair. Man keeps those camels,\r\ndonkeys, and goats. He provides them with water and protects them\r\nfrom lions, leopards, and snakes. In East Africa man has not yet\r\ninterfered, and the plants probably get the better of the animals.\r\nIn such places lions, leopards, and hyenas are common. It will be\r\nremembered that a lion not very long ago stormed and took charge of a\r\nrailway station on the line to Uganda, and was only routed with very\r\nheavy loss.\r\n\r\nThere is also some reason to suppose that the antelopes and other\r\ncreatures do help the plants in their efforts to colonize the Sahara.\r\nTheir droppings will very greatly improve the soil, and more vigorous\r\nthickets and undergrowth will spring up when the soil is improved in\r\nthis way. Such a vigorous growth of plants will be better able to\r\nresist the long eight or nine months' drought, and so help the wood\r\nto develop, until perhaps it is too thick, and the trees are too\r\nhigh, for the antelopes to graze upon them. In this manner the Acacia\r\nscrub is slowly and painfully colonizing the desert.\r\n\r\nIt is not only in Africa that one finds these half-deserts or scrub.\r\nThere is the Brigalow Scrub in Australia, which has a curious\r\nsilver-grey shimmering appearance on account of the blue-grey\r\nsickle-like leaves of the Brigalow Acacia. The foliage casts no\r\nshade, for the leaves are flat and thin, and place themselves\r\nedgewise to the light, so that there is no danger of the strong\r\nlight injuring them. Also in Australia is the Mallee Scrub, covering\r\nthousands of square miles between the Murray River and the coast. It\r\nconsists of bushy Eucalyptus, six to twelve feet high. Its monotonous\r\nappearance when seen from a small hill is very striking.[48] \"Below\r\nlies an endless sea of yellow-brown bushes: perhaps far away one\r\nmay observe the blue outline of some solitary hill or granite peak,\r\nbut otherwise nothing breaks the monotonous dark-brown horizon.\r\nEverything is silent and motionless save perhaps where the scrub-hen\r\nutters its complaining cry, or when the wind rustles the stiff\r\neucalyptus twigs.\"[49]\r\n\r\n  [48] Drude, _Vegetation der Erde_.\r\n\r\n  [49] Drude, _l.c._\r\n\r\nThere is a melancholy interest attaching to both the Mallee and\r\nBrigalow, for in them lie the bones of many gallant and persevering\r\nexplorers. Nor is the East African thorn-tree desert without its\r\nvictims. The missionary, Dr. Chalmers, was lost near Kibwezi in the\r\nTaru Desert.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE EGYPTIAN QUEEN HATARU'S EXPEDITION\r\n\r\n  The ships of the expedition are drawn up along the shores of Punt\r\n  (in Somaliland), and incense trees are being carried on board.\r\n  Notice the baboons on board ship, and the rays and sword-fish in\r\n  the water.]\r\n\r\nThere are a certain number of valuable plants found in these\r\nhalf-deserts or scrubs. Perhaps the earliest geographical\r\nexpedition of which we have a good account (with illustrations) is\r\nthat sent by the Egyptian Queen, Hatasu, from Thebes, about three\r\nthousand years ago. She built on the Red Sea a fleet of five ships,\r\neach able to carry from fifty to seventy people, and sent them to\r\nthe land of Punt, which was probably Somaliland. The natives lived\r\nin round huts built on piles like the ancient lake dwellings. The\r\nobject of the journey was to obtain incense. No less than thirty-one\r\nincense-bushes were dug up with as much earth as possible about their\r\nroots, and carried to the ships, where they were placed upright on\r\nthe deck and covered with an awning to keep off the sun's rays.\r\nWhether they did really survive the journey and grow in Egypt is\r\nuncertain. Sacks of resin, ebony, cassia, apes, baboons, dogs,\r\nleopard-skins, and slaves, as well as gold and silver, were also\r\ntaken away. The Queen of Punt accompanied them. From her appearance\r\nit is not probable that the Queen of Sheba was any relation, although\r\nsome writers have supposed that Sheba and Punt were the same place.\r\n\r\nThe whole story is represented in coloured bas-reliefs in the temple\r\nat Tel-el-Bahiri, near Thebes.[50]\r\n\r\n  [50] Rawlinson, _Story of Egypt_.\r\n\r\nThe incense here alluded to was a very valuable drug in Egypt on\r\naccount of its use in embalming mummies. Quite a number of gums,\r\nresins, and the like, are obtained from Somaliland and similar\r\nhalf-desert countries. The frankincense of the Bible, which may\r\nbe the incense of Hatasu, is obtained from _Olibanum_ produced by\r\nvarious species of Boswellia. In February and March, cuts are made by\r\nthe incense gatherers in the bark of the trees. Tears of resin soon\r\nappear and become dried by the sun over the wound. The best kinds\r\nstill come from Saba, in Arabia, where the Romans obtained it in\r\nthe time of Virgil. Besides Olibanum, frankincense contains Galbanum\r\n(_Ferula galbaniflua_) and Storax (_Storax officinale_). Equal parts\r\nof these were mixed with the horny shield of a certain shell-fish.\r\nWhen the last is burnt, it has a strong pungent odour. The Galbanum\r\nis now found in Persia, and Storax in Asia Minor, both half-desert\r\ncountries. The true Myrrh (_Commiphora myrrha_) is also found in East\r\nAfrica and South-west Arabia.\r\n\r\nThe name is supposed to be derived from Myrrha, the daughter of\r\nCinyras, King of Cyprus, who in consequence of a great crime was\r\nbanished to Arabia and became the tree which bears her name. The\r\nmyrrh of the Sacred Oracles was used as incense at least 3700 years\r\nago, and it is mentioned by Moses (Genesis xxxvii. 25).\r\n\r\nThe sovereign of England used always to present gold, frankincense,\r\nand myrrh in the Chapel Royal, London, on the feast of the Epiphany,\r\nand, strange though it may appear, the symbolic offering is still\r\nmade each year by our present king.\r\n\r\nBalm of Gilead (_Balsamodendron Gileadense_) belongs to scrub or\r\nhalf-desert regions. Cleopatra obtained plants from Jericho for her\r\ngarden at Heliopolis. The Jews used to sell it regularly to the\r\nmerchants of Tyre.\r\n\r\nIt is still valuable, for the essence is worth from £2 to £3 per lb.\r\n\r\nThe opoponax described by Dioscorides belongs to the Orient. It\r\nyields a valuable gum resin, which is much used in perfumery\r\n(_Pastinaca opoponax_). It also is obtained by incisions in the\r\nbark[51] of the tree.\r\n\r\n  [51] Ridley, _l.c._; Lindley, _l.c._; Maisch, _Materia Medica_.\r\n\r\nIn fact a very large proportion of these fragrant sweet-smelling\r\nsubstances, Myrrh, Cassia, Bdellium, etc., come from these sunny\r\nEastern lands, which are not exactly deserts but very close to them.\r\nManna, e.g., is obtained from the flowering Ash (_Fraxinus ormus_)\r\nin Sicily by transverse incisions being made in the bark, so that\r\nthe brownish or yellowish viscid juice exudes and hardens on the\r\nwound. _Ladanum_ is a varnish or gluey coating found on the leaves of\r\n_Cistus creticus_, which grows in Crete. In old times the glue was\r\ncollected from the beards of the goats which had been browsing on\r\nthe plant. Although this method, no doubt, increased the strength of\r\nthe perfume, it has been abandoned, and the ladanum is obtained by a\r\n\"kind of rake with a double row of long leathern straps.\" The straps\r\ntake the glue from the leaves. It is used as a perfume in Turkey.\r\n\r\nAnother very interesting Eastern plant sometimes seen in\r\nold-fashioned country gardens in Britain is the \"Burning-bush\"\r\n(_Dictamnus fraxinella_). Like a great many of these half-desert\r\nplants, it is full of an acrid, ethereal, odorous substance. On a\r\ncalm, hot summer's day, this material exudes from the leaves and\r\nsurrounds the plant with an invisible vaporous atmosphere. Such an\r\natmosphere probably assists in preventing the water from evaporating\r\nor being transpired from the leaves.[52]\r\n\r\n  [52] This was suggested by Tyndall, but has been denied by others.\r\n\r\nNow if one places a lighted match a little below the leaves or\r\nflowers this vapour catches fire, and there is a display of flames\r\nand smoke with little explosions, followed by a strong smell. The\r\nplant may be injured if it is set on fire too frequently, but\r\ngenerally does not seem to be any the worse for the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean is the home of the Myrtle and Olive, of Oranges and\r\nLemons, of Figs and Vines, of Almonds and Raisins, as well as of\r\nmany other important and interesting plants.\r\n\r\nThe olive crop in Italy yields about ninety millions of gallons of\r\nolive-oil every year. The olives are collected as soon as they become\r\nripe, and are crushed in circular stone troughs with a perpendicular\r\nmillstone. The paste is then pressed in bags and afterwards clarified\r\nby passing through cotton wool.[53] To the eye of a foreigner the\r\nwhite gnarled stems and silver-green foliage of the olive groves are\r\nnot particularly attractive.\r\n\r\n  [53] _Journal Society of Arts_, August, 1896.\r\n\r\nNear Burriana, in Spain, one may walk for miles through the\r\nplantations of oranges. The dark-green glossy leaves and golden\r\nfruit of the orange make a most beautiful contrast, but the dry,\r\nthirsty soil, and the careful way in which the water is regulated\r\nand supplied by small gutters, most jealously watched over, make the\r\ntourist realize the difficulty of agriculture in so dry and arid a\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe Myrtle is not a very important plant nowadays, though its berries\r\nare still eaten and myrtle wreaths used to be worn by the bride at\r\nevery wedding. In classical times it was sacred to Venus, but the\r\nvictors in the Olympian games were also crowned with myrtle, and the\r\nmagistrates at Athens had the same privilege. It is no longer used as\r\na medicine and for making wine. It is really a native of Persia, but\r\nhas been introduced to the Levant, Italy, France, and Spain.\r\n\r\nIt is along the Riviera that one finds a very curious and interesting\r\nindustry. This is the manufacture of perfumes and essences from the\r\npetals of flowers. A great many different flowers are used, such as\r\nthe Garden Violet, Mignonette (a native of Egypt imported in 1752),\r\nLily of the Valley, Tuberose, \"the sweetest flower for scent that\r\ngrows,\" Jonquil (_Narcissus jonquilla_), Heliotrope (imported from\r\nPeru in 1757), Spanish Jasmine (_J. grandiflorum_), which is a native\r\nof Nepaul, and was brought to Europe in 1629, and various Roses.[54]\r\n\r\n  [54] Heuzé, _Les Plantes Industrielles_. Most of the following\r\n  details are obtained from this valuable work.\r\n\r\nThese Roses have had a long, interesting, and honourable history.\r\nNo one knows when they were first cultivated. Solomon had his\r\nrose-gardens at Jericho. Queen Cleopatra spent some £400 on roses\r\nin one day, and Nero is said to have beaten this record by wasting\r\n4,000,000 sesterces (£30,000) in roses for a single banquet.\r\n\r\nRosewater is said to have been first produced by an Arab physician\r\ncalled Rhazés in the tenth century. When Sultan Saladin recovered\r\nJerusalem from the Crusaders in 1187, the pavement and walls of the\r\nMosque of Omar were washed and purified with rosewater. That stout\r\nwarrior Thibault IV, Count de Brie et de Champagne, brought back\r\nroses from Damascus on his return to his native land. That was the\r\norigin of the valuable Provence roses. The Lancastrians chose a\r\nProvence rose as their badge at the beginning of the Civil Wars of\r\nthe Roses in England.\r\n\r\nOtto of Roses, or the essential oil, was discovered by Princess Nour\r\nJehan at the court of the Great Mogul, and she received as her reward\r\na pearl necklace worth 30,000 rupees. The price of otto of roses\r\nseems to have been about £320 per pound in Persia and India when the\r\ntraveller Tavernier visited those countries in 1616.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, peers of France had to\r\npresent bouquets and crowns of roses to the assembled Parliament.\r\n\r\nAt present there are very important rose plantations in France,[55]\r\nBulgaria,[56] and in the Fayoum in Egypt. In France about ten or\r\ntwelve thousand roses are grown on two and a half acres. The season\r\nis from April to May. Women gather from twenty to twenty-five pounds\r\ndaily, and obtain from twopence to threepence for two and a half\r\npounds. Each tree will give about a quarter of a pound of roses. The\r\npetals are distilled to make rosewater.\r\n\r\n  [55] 4,400,000 pounds of roses were produced in France in one\r\n  year.\r\n\r\n  [56] In 1899 Philippopolis produced 1800-2000 kilogrammes of otto\r\n  of roses, worth 700 to 800 francs the kilo. (_Pharm. Journ._\r\n  Sept. 1st, 1900).\r\n\r\nSome 12,000 people on the slopes of the Balkans, at Kerzanlik and\r\nother places, entirely depend upon their rose plantations. These are\r\non light soil, fully exposed to the sun, at over 1200 feet above the\r\nsea. It is interesting to find that the pure mountain air strengthens\r\nthe perfume, for these Balkan roses are fifty per cent. richer in\r\nessences than those of lowland plants.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting plant much cultivated in the Riviera is the\r\nCassier (_Acacia farnesiana_). It is really a native of India, but\r\nwas introduced from the West Indies to Europe in 1656. Cannes,\r\nGrasse, Antibes, and Nice are the places where it is most cultivated.\r\nIts flowers appear from July to November. An old tree may yield as\r\nmuch as twelve to twenty pounds of flowers, worth about five to\r\nsix francs. But 116 pounds of flowers only yield about a pound of\r\nessence, so that it is not surprising that this last is worth £60 the\r\npound.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation is a little uncertain, for a temperature of three or\r\nfour degrees below the freezing-point kills the trees.\r\n\r\nThe pomades made from many of these flowers are produced as follows:\r\nA series of trays are covered with fat or grease; the petals are\r\nplaced on the grease and replaced by fresh petals every twenty-four\r\nhours or so; in the end the grease is so saturated with scent that it\r\nforms pomade or pomatum.\r\n\r\nThus these half-desert countries are by no means without interest\r\nfrom a botanical point of view. The conditions of life are no doubt\r\nhard both for plants and animals. The scent so richly produced\r\ndepends upon the strong sunlight and pure air. It is very useful,\r\npartly because it attracts those useful insects which carry the\r\npollen, but also because such odours are distasteful to grazing\r\nanimals. The gums, incenses, thorns, and spines are all of great use\r\nto the plant in its dangerous struggle for existence with hungry\r\ncamels and thirsty soil.\r\n\r\nWhen men understood how to irrigate the soil, and before they were\r\nfoolish enough to cut down the forests which once guarded the\r\nmountain springs, these half-deserts were exceedingly prosperous;\r\nthey were full of vigorous intellectual life, and of strong, hardy,\r\nand industrious peoples. Asia Minor, Turkey, Greece, and the Northern\r\nCoast of Africa from Morocco to Egypt, were rich and wonderful\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nBut it was not only the destruction of the forests that has ruined\r\nthem. The curse of Mohammed, the fatalism produced by his religion,\r\nand the slavery which is a necessary part thereof, have destroyed the\r\npeople in mind, body, and spirit. Even in Greece, Algiers, and Cyprus\r\nthere has been as yet but small recovery.\r\n\r\nIn the future, not merely these countries, but Northern Nigeria,\r\nBritish East Africa, and South-west Cape Colony, may have as rich\r\na history as Greece, if British brain and energy are helped by the\r\nstrong muscles of the African.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nON TEA, COFFEE, CHOCOLATE, AND TOBACCO\r\n\r\n   English tea-drinking--Story of our tea--Assam\r\n   coolies--Manufacture in India and China--Celestial\r\n   moisture--Danger of tea--The hermit and his\r\n   intelligent goat--Government, coffee and\r\n   cafés--Chicory--Chocolate--Aztecs--Kola and its curious\r\n   effects--Tobacco--Sir Walter Raleigh--Great emperors\r\n   and tobacco--Could we grow tobacco?--Story of a Sumatra\r\n   cigar--Danger of young people smoking tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn every day throughout the year English people drink about 600,000\r\nlb. of tea. That is about 270 tons, which would form, when made into\r\nthe beverage, a lake quite large enough to float a man-of-war! No\r\nother civilized nation takes its tea in the reckless way that we do.\r\nYet our fellow-subjects in Australia drink even more than ourselves.\r\n\r\nAlmost the whole of this tea is grown in British colonies or\r\npossessions, manufactured by British subjects, and imported in\r\nBritish ships.\r\n\r\nThe coolies who work in the tea-gardens of Assam and Ceylon, the\r\nEnglishman who manages them, the engineers in Glasgow and Newcastle\r\nwho made the machinery, the shipbuilders, shipowners, and crews, are\r\nall fellow-countrymen of those who drink the cup that cheers. Every\r\nsixpence in the £8,000,000, which is our yearly account for tea,\r\nfinds its way into the pockets of our fellow-subjects either at home\r\nor abroad.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Photo_\r\n\r\n  _Skeen & Co._\r\n\r\n  WEIGHING THE DAY'S WORK\r\n\r\n  The women in the Ceylon Tea Gardens bring in their baskets in the\r\n  evening. These are then weighed as shown and the labourers paid\r\n  accordingly.]\r\n\r\nEvery one would suppose that a trade like this, which benefits\r\neverybody, would be very carefully fostered by Government.\r\n\r\nFar from it, for this is one of those articles that are always being\r\nattacked by Chancellors of the Exchequer, who seem to have a special\r\nill will against tea.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is so heavily taxed that it is extremely difficult to make\r\na profit on tea-gardens. Elsewhere in this chapter some other very\r\ncurious facts will be found illustrating the extraordinary habits and\r\nmethods of the British Government.\r\n\r\nThe author does not try to explain these facts, but only points them\r\nout; a nation that can manage to exist at all when such things are\r\ndone by its Government is a nation to which one is proud to belong.\r\n\r\nThe Tea-plant is a native of China and Assam. It is a very handsome\r\nshrub resembling a camellia, with dark, glossy, green leaves and\r\nbeautiful flowers. It is said to have been used in China about 2700\r\nB.C., and the first plantations in India were made with Chinese seed.\r\nBut a Mr. Bruce reported the presence of an indigenous wild tea in\r\nAssam.[57] Three botanists who were sent to investigate the question\r\nsuggested that this Assam variety was only the Chinese plant run\r\nwild, and advised the introduction of Chinese seedlings. This was a\r\nvery unfortunate mistake, for the wild Assam plant gives much better\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n  [57] Watt, _Economic Dictionary of the Products of India_. This\r\n  valuable work of reference should be consulted for interesting\r\n  details as to all the plants cited in this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe jungle is first cut down and cleared away by the native tribes,\r\nwith the help of elephants. Then at the right season, i.e. after the\r\nrains begin, the Indian women and coolies go into the plantations.\r\nThey carry on their backs a basket supported by a band across the\r\nforehead. These women nip off the first two leaves and a bud with\r\ntheir finger and thumb and throw them into the basket over their\r\nshoulders. When the basket is full they take it back to the factory,\r\nwhere their gatherings are weighed. The actual manufacture is, in\r\nIndia and Ceylon, all performed by machinery. The tea is first\r\nemptied on to trays in a shallow layer: a pound of tea when so spread\r\nout covers more than a square yard. These trays are then placed in a\r\nroom which is heated to a high temperature, for \"withering.\" After\r\nsix hours it is passed through a machine which \"rolls\" or gives a\r\ntwist to the leaves. It is then \"fermented\" on cement floors, where\r\nthe tea is covered by strips of moist muslin. It is again rolled and\r\nafterwards dried or \"fired.\" The sifting out of the different sorts\r\nor blends, and also the packing of the tea in chests, are done by\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nThat is the Indian system of manufacture, in which there is scarcely\r\nany hand-labour.\r\n\r\nIn China the rolling, and indeed every stage of the process, appears\r\nto be done by hand. It is obvious that in the handling, pattings,\r\nand rollings of the tea by Chinese coolies, \"celestial moisture\" may\r\nbe imparted to it. In spite of this, however, the export of Chinese\r\ntea is steadily diminishing. In the old days, the Liverpool \"tea\r\nclippers,\" fast and beautiful sailing-ships, raced each other home\r\nfrom China in order to get the first tea upon the market.\r\n\r\nTea is sometimes dangerous, and especially when it is allowed to\r\nstew on the fire for hours at a time. Besides _theine_, which is the\r\nstimulating, active part of it, and which is a bracing tonic to the\r\nnerves, _tannin_ is also found therein. When meat is taken with a\r\nlarge amount of _tannin_, the latter acts on the meat exactly as it\r\ndoes on hides in a tanning factory. It forms a substance resembling\r\nleather, which taxes the powers of the strongest digestion.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time in those fertile mountains of Abyssinia which have\r\nnever yet been explored by the white man, there was a very holy and\r\npious hermit. He used to live entirely on the milk of a few goats\r\nwhich he carefully tended with his own hands. One morning he noticed\r\nthat one of these goats showed signs of unusual excitement. It was\r\nfrisking about, and obviously was exceedingly well pleased with\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThat was not a usual experience with the holy recluse, who watched\r\nthe animal carefully. He soon discovered that it was in the habit of\r\ngrazing on the bright red berries of a very handsome shrub in the\r\nhills. The anchorite tasted those fruits and discovered that he also\r\nbecame both pleased with himself and somewhat excited.\r\n\r\nHis disciples soon discovered a brightness and exhilaration, an\r\nunusual \"snap,\" in the good man's sermons, and they watched him and\r\nalso discovered _Coffee_!\r\n\r\nThe author refuses to take the responsibility of more than the\r\ndiscovery of the above story. Coffee was, however, introduced into\r\nArabia by the Sheikh Dabhani in 1470. It was taken to Constantinople\r\nabout 1554, and about a hundred years later coffee-houses and _cafés_\r\nwere regular and habitual daily resorts in London and Paris.\r\n\r\nAs usual with stimulants of all kinds, the watchful eye of a moral\r\nGovernment discovered something objectionable in coffee, and Charles\r\nII in 1675 imposed heavy taxes, or rather forbade the use of it\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nThere was in 1718 a coffee-plant in the botanical gardens at\r\nAmsterdam, and in that year some of its seeds were sent to Surinam,\r\nin Dutch Guiana. Apparently the millions of shrubs in the enormous\r\ncoffee plantations of the New World are all descended from this\r\nparticular Amsterdam plant.\r\n\r\nThis New World coffee is by far the most important supply. Brazil\r\nalone exports about £19,000,000 worth of coffee, and that from the\r\nNew World forms about 82 per cent of the total world's production.\r\n\r\nThe story of coffee in Ceylon is a tragedy. There happened to be in\r\nthe jungle a particular fungus (_Hemileia vastatrix_) which got its\r\nliving on the leaves of wild plants belonging to the coffee order\r\n(_Rubiaceæ_) and others. When Arabian coffee was introduced, the\r\nfungus began to attack its leaves. The result was the utter ruin of\r\nthe industry. It is said that about £15,000,000 was lost by this\r\n_Hemileia_ disease in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe plantations require a great deal of care. The shrubs have to\r\nbe carefully pruned, and the preparation of the coffee bean is\r\nnot a very easy matter. It is really the seed of a bright red,\r\nfleshy berry. The pulp or flesh has to be removed, and also both\r\na horny skin, the \"parchment,\" and a thin delicate membrane, the\r\n\"silverskin,\" in which the seed is enclosed. Coffee is not nearly so\r\nmuch used in Britain as in some other places, and particularly in\r\nHolland, for the Dutch drink about twenty-one pounds per head in the\r\nyear, whilst we in Great Britain only use about three-quarters of a\r\npound.\r\n\r\nIt is in fact not very easy to make good coffee, and it is absolutely\r\nnecessary to grind and roast the beans just before using them. Very\r\noften also too little coffee is used.\r\n\r\nTinned coffee is often adulterated with either Chicory or Endives,\r\nbut those are only the two most important impurities, for burnt\r\nsugar, biscuits, locust-beans, date-stones, rye, malt, and other\r\nsubstances are ground up and mixed with coffee.\r\n\r\nThe use of chicory is, however, more or less recognized. It is\r\nthe roots which are ground up and mixed with it. They contain no\r\n_caffeine_, which is the active part of the coffee bean, and are\r\nquite harmless. At one time chicory was grown in Essex and other\r\nEnglish counties, and was a distinctly profitable crop.\r\n\r\nHere again come in the mysterious ways of the British Government.\r\nThe cultivation of chicory was absolutely forbidden by the Inland\r\nRevenue Department; but a considerable amount is still grown in\r\nBelgium and is imported to this country. Those who prefer chicory\r\nwith their coffee have to pay a heavy duty; but the Belgian farmer\r\nis allowed and the British farmer is forbidden to take up a paying\r\nand profitable industry! The plant is allied to the dandelion. It\r\noccasionally occurs in this country as a weed, and is a rather\r\nstriking plant with bright blue flowers.\r\n\r\nAnother of these useful productions which also suffers from a heavy\r\nduty is Cocoa or Chocolate. There are a great many different plants\r\ncalled Co Co, or by some name very similar to it. The Cocoanut Palm\r\nfurnishes not only the nuts but the fibre or coir enclosing them,\r\nas well as a great many other useful substances. The _cocaine_\r\nused by dentists, and which deadens or stupefies the nerves of\r\nthe teeth, is derived from the leaves of a Peruvian shrub, \"Coca\"\r\n(_Erythroxylan Coca_). These leaves are chewed in the mouth and have\r\nvery extraordinary effects, especially on the Indian labourers. They\r\nare a strong nerve stimulus and take away any feeling of hunger or\r\nfatigue. It was by the use of coca leaves that the postmen of the\r\nInca emperors in Peru were enabled to carry messages at the rate of\r\n150 miles a day. Then again the Cocoes of the West Indian Islands is\r\na sort of Yam (_Colocasia antiquorum_). Coco-de-mer is the fruit of a\r\npalm common in the Seychelles Islands (_Lodoicea Seychellarum_).\r\n\r\nThe cocoa which gives the ordinary chocolate and cocoa of the\r\nbreakfast table is the seed of a tree (_Theobroma cacao_). The name\r\nis derived from [Greek: theos], god, and [Greek: brôma], food. It may\r\nbe translated, \"That which the gods browse upon.\"\r\n\r\nThis plant is one of those which were cultivated by that ancient,\r\npowerful, semi-civilized nation, the Aztecs of Mexico. They have\r\nalmost entirely vanished; at any rate their descendants, if they have\r\nany, exercise practically no influence in the world, but they have\r\nleft us chocolate. They fully appreciated the plant, and even more\r\nthan we do, for they worshipped it with grateful and superstitious\r\nawe.\r\n\r\nIn their tombs, chocolate flavoured with vanilla was placed, in order\r\nto provide the ghost with sufficient sustenance for his or her aerial\r\nflight to the Land of the Sun. Columbus brought home some cocoa\r\non his return from his first voyage. The Jesuit fathers in Mexico\r\ngreatly helped in developing the plantation of cocoa in the days of\r\nthe Spaniards. At present the largest amount comes from Ecuador,\r\nwhich produces about 50,000,000 pounds weight.\r\n\r\nIt is a small tree, twenty to thirty feet high, growing in the warm,\r\nmoist, and sheltered forests of Central and South America. It has\r\na large fruit, within which are the numerous cocoa beans, \"nibs,\"\r\nor seeds. The tree does not bear until it is five years old. The\r\nfermentation and drying of the beans require some care.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & Underwood_\r\n  _London & New York_\r\n\r\n  A TOBACCO PLANTATION IN CUBA]\r\n\r\nChocolate is made from the powdered cocoa mixed with sugar and other\r\nmaterials. Chocolate, like tea and coffee, depends for its effect\r\non an extremely powerful drug, _theine_ or _caffeine_, of which it\r\ncontains minute proportions. There are very few other plants known\r\nwhich possess this powerful substance. Amongst these is the Kola nut,\r\nwhich is everywhere regularly employed in West Africa. On the way up\r\nto the barracks at Freetown, Sierra Leone, natives were always to be\r\nseen seated by the roadside; they sold kola nuts to the soldiers, who\r\nwere thereby enabled to walk steadily and uprightly past the sentry,\r\nand to return his challenge in a clearly articulate voice, although\r\nthey might previously have been somewhat injudiciously convivial in\r\nthe town. This kola is one of the very strongest nerve tonics; under\r\nits influence men can endure severe physical and mental strain.\r\nLike the others, however, a depressing reaction inevitably follows,\r\naccompanied by insomnia, headache, and other evil effects.\r\n\r\nWhen one comes to ask, Why do those few plants out of all the vast\r\nmultitude of the vegetable world possess such extraordinary virtues?\r\nit is difficult to find an answer. Possibly some obscure insect or\r\nfungus enemy finds _caffeine_ poisonous.\r\n\r\nNor can one find any reason for the curious properties developed in\r\nthe Tobacco leaf by fermentation, except a possible protection to\r\nthe leaf from the attacks of insects. No doubt the leaf, even in its\r\nnatural state, would be too strong for them.\r\n\r\nTobacco is a native of Central America. The name _Nicotiana tabacum_\r\nis derived (the first) from a certain Jean Nicot, Ambassador to the\r\nKing of Portugal, and the second from the Haytian name for a pipe.\r\n\r\nOn Columbus's voyage in 1492 the use of tobacco was noted. The story\r\nof Sir Walter Raleigh's servant, who threw a bucket of water over\r\nhis master when the latter was smoking a pipe, is not supported by\r\nmuch evidence, but it seems to be probable that Sir Walter did smoke\r\nhis pipe on the way to the scaffold.\r\n\r\nAt any rate it was cultivated in Europe by the year 1570, and Spenser\r\nspeaks of the \"soveraine Weed, divine Tobacco.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the first it was detested by all governments and authorities.\r\nJames I published a very intemperate _Counterblast against Tobacco_.\r\nIt was prohibited by the Czar of Russia in 1635, and by the King of\r\nFrance. The great Sultan Jehanghir in India, Sultan Amurath II in\r\nTurkey, Shah Abbas the Great in Persia, and the Emperor Kang Ching\r\nin China, all prohibited the use of tobacco in their respective\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nYet none of these great rulers were able to check its progress. The\r\n\"Herb of Amiability,\" or the \"Queen Herb of the rude Barbarian\" as it\r\nis described in Chinese, prevails almost over the whole earth. There\r\nis scarcely a people or tribe in existence which does not use it.\r\n\r\nBut almost everywhere it is either heavily taxed or a Government\r\nmonopoly; in the latter case it is always exceedingly bad. We\r\nourselves import tobacco worth about £4,500,000 in the year, and\r\npay a heavy duty. The world probably smokes from 1,800,000,000 to\r\n2,000,000,000 pounds of tobacco every year.\r\n\r\nThe plant is a very pretty one, with large leaves and long pinky or\r\nwhite flowers, which are open and strongly scented at night. It is\r\nan annual, and is not at all difficult to cultivate. There is an\r\nimpression in this country that it is a tropical plant, but by far\r\nthe greatest amount of our tobacco comes from temperate countries.\r\nLarge quantities are grown in Germany, in Hungary, and in other parts\r\nof Europe. As a matter of fact tobacco was once cultivated in both\r\nEngland and Scotland.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence to show that in 1832 it was successfully grown in\r\nRoxburghshire, where 1000 pounds an acre was obtained. The land was\r\nlet at about £5 to £6 per acre. Experiments of recent years have also\r\nproved very encouraging, and in fact it is difficult to see how any\r\nreasonable doubt can exist as to the fact that it would be perfectly\r\neasy to grow plenty of that sort of tobacco which we now obtain from\r\nHolland and Germany. A prominent Irish statesman has admitted this:\r\n\"There was no doubt but that tobacco could be grown in Ireland, but\r\nwhether there are Irishmen patriotic enough to smoke it, _is_ very\r\ndoubtful.\"[58]\r\n\r\n  [58] Wrightson, _Journal R. Agr. Soc._, Second Series, vol. 10,\r\n  part ii. p. 312; Jenkins, _Ibid._, vol. 11, part i. p. 192; De\r\n  Lanne, _Ibid._, vol. 23, part i. p. 213. Carter, _Tobacco in\r\n  England_.\r\n\r\nOf course every one knows that the differences in tobacco depend\r\nchiefly on the preparation, but the _Constitutional_ objection to\r\ntobacco, illustrated by the above remark, is the real reason why it\r\nis not grown.\r\n\r\nOliver Cromwell sent his troopers to ride down the growing crops.\r\nCharles II imposed a penalty of £1600 per acre. Modern statesmen are\r\nflippant and unfair.\r\n\r\nThe reason of course is that a large income is cheaply obtained by\r\ntaxing imported tobacco. If this were at all interfered with, new\r\ntaxes, which would certainly be unpopular, would be required.\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal of interest in the story of the tobacco\r\nplantations. Many prisoners of the Civil War in England were sold to\r\nVirginia and other places. Even nowadays there is some romance in\r\nthe history of a cigar. In the Dutch island of Sumatra the jungle is\r\ncleared away by the natives under the orders of an English manager.\r\nChinese coolies are then imported. The estate provides each coolie\r\nwith tools, tea, a barber, and sufficient cash to buy rice, fish, or\r\npork, as well as a little over for his opium, to spend in fireworks,\r\nand to propitiate his demons.\r\n\r\nThe coolie grows the tobacco, which is bought from him and\r\nmanufactured by the estate. Some of it goes to India, where it is\r\nused as the outer wrapper of cigars.[59]\r\n\r\n  [59] Dunning, _Tobacco_, 1876.\r\n\r\nFor adulterating tobacco all sorts of leaves are occasionally\r\nemployed, such as those of the dock, chicory, burdock, foxglove,\r\ncomfrey, elm, coltsfoot, plantain, beech, cabbage, lettuce (steeped\r\nin tar oil), etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe substance nicotine is a deadly and dangerous poison. When young\r\npeople smoke tobacco, it has been quite conclusively proved that they\r\nwill very probably not reach their full growth, but be miserable\r\nweaklings, stunted, half-developed, and below the proper standard of\r\na man.\r\n\r\nThis is not surprising, if one reflects on the constitution of\r\ntobacco smoke. This contains \"nicotine, empyreumatic resin,\r\noil, ammonia, carbonic acid, carbonic oxide, hydrocyanic acid,\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, carburetted hydrogen, and paraffin.\"[60]\r\n\r\n  [60] _Journal Society of Arts_, March, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nON DESERTS\r\n\r\n   What are deserts like?--Camel-riding--Afterglow--Darwin in\r\n   South America--Big Bad Lands--Plants which train themselves\r\n   to endure thirst--Cactus and euphorbia--Curious shapes--Grey\r\n   hairs--Iceplant--Esparto grass--Retama--Colocynth--Sudden\r\n   flowering of the Karoo--Short-lived flowers--Colorado\r\n   Desert--Date palms on the Nile--Irrigation in Egypt--The\r\n   creaking Sakkieh--Alexandria hills--The Nile and Euphrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcross the whole of Africa, at its very broadest part, from the\r\ndominions of the Emperor of the Sahara at Cape Juby on the Atlantic,\r\nand to the very borders of British India, stretches a desert of the\r\nmost uncompromising character. It is famous in history: the strongest\r\nraces of man, the great religions of the world, as well as most\r\ncultivated plants and domestic animals, have originated in some part\r\nof this dreary waste.\r\n\r\nOne cannot really appreciate deserts unless one has really seen them.\r\nBut it is necessary to try to describe what they are like.\r\n\r\nSometimes the desert is a wilderness of broken, stony hills covered\r\nby angular pieces of shivered rock. In other places the soil is hard,\r\nand is everywhere covered by pebbles or shingle. Often it is a mere\r\nwaste of sand blown into downs and hillocks which look sometimes like\r\nthe sand dunes by the coast, and elsewhere like the waves of the sea.\r\n\r\nOne finds valleys in the desert quite like ordinary ones in shape,\r\nbut instead of water there is only sand in sweeping curves and\r\nhollows, like the snow-wreaths and drifts in a highland glen.\r\n\r\nRocks stand out of this, but their projecting faces are polished\r\nsmooth and glittering or deeply cut by the flinty particles scraping\r\nover them continually in storms and hurricanes.\r\n\r\nThe traveller on camel-back, where his waist has to act as a sort of\r\nuniversal joint giving to every unexpected jolt and wrench of his\r\nrough-paced mount, suffers from the heat, for nowhere else in the\r\nworld are there such high temperatures. He suffers from thirst, and\r\nstill more from the dust which fills eyes, mouth, nostrils, and ears.\r\n\r\nYet the dry pure air is most exhilarating.\r\n\r\nIn the evening there is a feast for the eyes in the glorious\r\n_afterglow_ when the sun has just set. The light from below the\r\nhorizon produces an ever-changing, indescribable play of colour from\r\nviolet to salmon pink and through the most delicate shades of yellow,\r\nblue, and rose, until everything fades and there reigns only the\r\nmysterious silence of the beautiful starlit night.\r\n\r\nNo wonder the air is dry and pure, for rain only falls on perhaps\r\neight days in the year in some places (Ghardiaia).\r\n\r\nYet plants manage to exist even where there is only about seven\r\ninches of rain annually.\r\n\r\nBut this seems still more extraordinary if one remembers that sand\r\nmay be almost glowing hot during the day, whilst in winter it may be,\r\nat night, cooled below the freezing-point.\r\n\r\nYet a desert absolutely bare of plants is an exceedingly rare\r\nphenomenon. Such do occur. Darwin speaks of \"an undulating country,\r\na complete and utter desert.\" This is not very far from Iquique in\r\nSouth America. \"The road was strewed with the bones and dried skins\r\nof the many beasts of burden which had perished upon it from fatigue.\r\nExcepting the _Vultur aura_, which preys on the carcases, I saw\r\nneither bird, quadruped, reptile, nor insect. On the coast mountains,\r\nat the height of about 2000 feet, where, during this season, the\r\nclouds generally hang, a very few cacti were growing in the clefts\r\nof rock; and the loose sand was strewed over with a lichen which\r\nlies on the surface quite unattached. ... In some parts it was in\r\nsufficient quantity to tinge the sand, as seen from a distance, of\r\na pale yellowish colour. Farther inland, during the whole ride of\r\nfourteen leagues, I saw only one other vegetable production, and that\r\nwas a most minute yellow lichen, growing on the bones of the dead\r\nmules.\"[61]\r\n\r\n  [61] Darwin, _Naturalist's Voyage round the World in the Beagle_,\r\n  p. 387.\r\n\r\nRydberg, speaking of the Big Bad Lands in South Dakota, says that\r\nthere are in some places great stretches of land consisting of cañons\r\nseparated by small ridges, in which not a speck of green is visible\r\nover several sections.[62] (A section is more than a square mile.)\r\n\r\n  [62] Schimper, _l.c._, p. 674.\r\n\r\nBut though Aden looks exactly like \"a barrack stove that no one's\r\nlit for years and years,\" plants grow there. Even in Egypt, when\r\none has left the Nile inundation limit, a botanical eye very seldom\r\nfails to detect plants of one sort or another even in a dangerous and\r\nthorough-going desert.\r\n\r\nPlants are almost as hardy as men; they can adapt themselves to\r\nalmost any climate.\r\n\r\nIn some curious and inexplicable way the very dangers of the climate\r\nseem to produce automatically a means of resisting it. The chief\r\nperil, of course, is a loss of the precious water through the\r\nleaves. When the skin or epidermis of a plant is being formed, the\r\nwalls of its cells are laid down, layer by layer, one inside the\r\nother, by the secretion of the living matter inside. In a dry desert\r\nthe loss of water by evaporation will be so rapid that these layers\r\nof cell-wall are much thicker than in ordinary plants. The very\r\nfact that they are thicker and less penetrable tends to prevent any\r\nfurther loss of water.[63]\r\n\r\n  [63] Schimper, _l.c._, p. 653.\r\n\r\nSo that plants in a dry climate have the power of altering themselves\r\nto resist its dangers.\r\n\r\nAnother author found that, in Scandinavia, plants of the same species\r\ncan acclimatize themselves if necessary. Sheep's Sorrel which had\r\ngrown on dry, droughty gravel banks only lost 10 per cent. of its\r\nwater in the first two days, when it was artificially dried. Other\r\nSheep's Sorrels, which had been luxuriating in meadows where they had\r\nno lack of moisture, lost no less than one third (33 per cent.) of\r\ntheir water when dried in the same way.\r\n\r\nThat is interesting, because very likely our readers might in\r\ncrossing a desert be perishing of thirst when a Bedouin Arab would be\r\nperfectly happy. The plants have learnt to do without water just in\r\nthe same way as the Arab has done.\r\n\r\nOf the many interesting desert plants, the Succulents, Cacti,\r\nEuphorbias, and others of the same extraordinary, fleshy, dropsical\r\nappearance, come first.\r\n\r\nWhen a Cereus plant (one of the American Giant Cacti) was dried,\r\nit did not lose the whole of its water for 576 days. That is\r\nprobably the longest time \"between drinks\" on record. A Houseleek\r\n(_Sempervivum_), which has to grow on dry rocks where it has no water\r\nfor days together, remained quite fresh for 165 days.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: GIANT CACTUS NEAR ACONCAGUA VALLEY, CHILE\r\n\r\n  This plant was about 8 feet high. The darker part on the tallest\r\n  branch is the dark red flower of the parasitic horanthus. The\r\n  thorns covering the branches are quite distinct.]\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why these plants took so long to dry\r\nup. To begin with, they have inside their stems and leaves certain\r\nsubstances which hold water and delay its escape. Moreover their\r\nextraordinary shapes are of very great assistance. They prefer\r\nglobular, round, circular, pear-shaped, or cylindrical forms.\r\n\r\nSuppose you were to cut such a round mass into thin slices and lay\r\nthem out flat, it is quite clear that they would cover a much greater\r\nsurface. Thin leaves also, if squashed up into a round ball, would\r\nhave a very much smaller surface.\r\n\r\nThe water can only escape from the surface exposed, so that these\r\ncondensed round balls and fleshy columns have far less water-losing\r\nsurface than ordinary leaves.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, it was found by calculation that the surface of\r\nan Echinocactus was 300 times less for the same amount of stuff as\r\nthat of an Aristolochia leaf. If the actual loss of water from the\r\nEchinocactus, as found by experiment, was reckoned as one unit per\r\nsquare inch, then the amount of water lost from a square inch of the\r\nAristolochia was no less than 5000 units!\r\n\r\nThis shows that these odd, outrageous shapes of Prickly Pears, Cacti,\r\nand other succulents are an extraordinary help to them. We have\r\nalready pointed out in a previous chapter how necessary their spines\r\nand prickles are if they must resist rats, mice, camels, and other\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nWhat we may call the \"hedgehog\" type of plant is also very common in\r\ndesert countries. There are many woody little, much branched, twiggy\r\nshrublets, which bristle all over with thorns and spines. They are\r\nnot at all fleshy, but do with the least conceivable amount of water.\r\n\r\nAnother striking characteristic of the desert flora is noticed by\r\nevery one. Almost every plant is clothed either in white cottonwool,\r\nlike the Lammie's Lug of our gardens, or else in grey hairs. The\r\ngeneral tint of the landscape is not green, but it is rather the\r\ncolour of the soil silvered over by these grey-haired plants.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this is, of course, quite easy to understand. We put\r\non a thick overcoat if we are going to walk in a Scotch mist, to\r\nkeep out the moisture. These plants cover themselves with hairs or\r\ncottonwool to keep the moisture inside. It does not escape easily\r\nthrough the woolly hairs on the skin.\r\n\r\nOne very strange plant should be noticed here. This is the Iceplant\r\n(_Mesembryanthemum cristallinum_). Every part of it is covered with\r\nlittle glittering swellings which shine in the sun like minute ice\r\ncrystals. The swellings contain a store of water, or rather of\r\ncolourless sap, which makes it able to exist in dry places. Dr.\r\nLudwig says that a torn-off branch remained quite fresh for months on\r\nhis study table. It is probable that these peculiar pearl or ice-like\r\nswellings also focus the sunlight, acting like lenses, upon the inner\r\npart of the leaf, but that is not as yet fully understood.\r\n\r\nThere are two grasses, growing in the desert, which are of some\r\nvalue; both are called Esparto or Halfa. They are very dry, woody,\r\nor rather wiry grasses, especially common in Algeria, Tripoli, and\r\nalso found in Spain. One of them, _Stipa tenacissima_, grows in rocky\r\nsoil in Morocco, Algeria, and Tripoli. The Arabs search for it in\r\nthe hills, and dig it up by the roots; they then load their camels\r\nwith the grass and bring it to the ports whence it is sent to London\r\nor other places. A very good and durable paper is made from it, and\r\nropes, mats, and even shoes are also produced from the fibre. Part\r\nof the \"esparto\" is, however, furnished by another grass (_Lygeum\r\nsparteum_). The natives sometimes tie a knot in a halfa leaf, which,\r\naccording to them, cures a strain of the back. The Stipa is also\r\nused as fodder, but it is not nutritious and is indeed sometimes\r\ndangerous. In one year Britain imported 187,000 tons of esparto,\r\nworth nearly £800,000. The yield is said to be about ten tons per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nAnother very interesting plant at Tripoli and in the North African\r\nDesert generally, is a sort of broom, the Retama (_Retama Raetam_).\r\nIt is not very unlike the common broom, but has long, leafless,\r\nwhip-like branches covered by bright pink-and-white flowers. It\r\ncan often be seen half submerged in waves of sand, and struggling\r\nnevertheless to hold its own. As it has no leaves its loss of water\r\nis very much kept down. This is the Juniper of the Bible, and it is\r\nstill used for making coals.\r\n\r\nThe length of the roots is very great in most of the broom-like,\r\n\"hedgehog,\" and other plants. A quite small plant not more than six\r\nor eight inches high will have a root as thick as one's thumb. Even\r\nat a depth of four or five feet below the surface its root will be\r\nas thick as the little finger, so that the root-length is at least\r\ntwenty times the height of the visible part above ground. These\r\nthirsty roots explore the ground in every direction, and go very deep\r\ndownwards in their search for water.\r\n\r\nAnother very interesting plant in the Egyptian Desert is _Citrullus\r\nColocynth_, from which the drug colocynth is prepared. The great\r\nround yellow-green fruit and finely divided bright green leaves may\r\nbe seen lying on the sand. It remains green all the summer, but\r\nappears not to have any particular protection against loss of water.\r\nIt is always supplied by its roots with underground water. If a stem\r\nis cut through it withers away in a few minutes. This is found also\r\nin Asia Minor, Greece, and Spain. The pulp of the fruit contains\r\na strong medicinal substance; it is a drastic purgative, and in\r\noverdoses is an irritant poison. This was probably the Wild Vine or\r\ngourd which the young prophet gathered, and which produced \"death\r\nin the pot.\" He probably mistook it for a water melon. It is still\r\nplentiful near Gilgal (2 Kings xiv. 38-41).[64]\r\n\r\n  [64] Ridley, _Pharmaceutical Journal_, May 19th, 1900.\r\n\r\nBelow the surface of the earth, of course, there is not nearly the\r\nsame dryness or danger of losing water, so that there are often a\r\ngreat number of bulbs, tubers, and the like hidden in the soil. There\r\nthey wait patiently, sometimes for a whole year or even for a longer\r\nperiod. So soon as a shower of rain falls they start to life, push\r\nout their leaves, and live at very high pressure for a few days.\r\nAfter a shower of rain, the Karoo in South Africa, for instance, is\r\nan extraordinarily beautiful country. There are bulbous Pelargoniums,\r\na very curious leafless cucurbitaceous plant (_Acanthosicyos_),\r\nhundreds and thousands of Lilies, Irids, and Amaryllids. A single\r\nscarlet flower of a Brunsvigia can be seen more than a mile away!\r\n\r\nThese tender and delicate, exquisitely beautiful bulbs flourish\r\namongst the succulent Euphorbias and Mesembryanthemums, between the\r\nhedgehog-like thorny plants and the woody little densely-branched\r\nmats of the permanent flora. The rain stimulates even these last to\r\nput out green leaves and flowers, but their time comes later on, when\r\nby the return of the usual drought every leaf and flower and the\r\nfruit of every bulb has been shrivelled up, turned into powder, and\r\nscattered in dust by the wind.[65]\r\n\r\n  [65] Scott Elliot, _Trans. Bot. Soc. Edin._, vol. 18, p. 243.\r\n\r\nThen the Karoo becomes unlovely, desolate, and barren-looking, with\r\nonly its inconspicuous permanent plants visible.\r\n\r\nThe above description applies to bulbs and perennial plants with\r\nunderground stores of food. Yet these are by no means the only plants\r\nwhich manage to exist in the Egyptian and Arabian desert. After a\r\nshower of rain a whole crowd of tiny annuals suddenly develop from\r\nseed; they come into full flower and have set their seed before they\r\nare killed off by a return of the desert conditions, when the effects\r\nof the rain have died away. These plants are not really desert plants\r\nat all, for they only grow during the short time that it is not a\r\ndesert. They are like the Ephemerid insects which live for a summer\r\nday only.\r\n\r\nNor is it only in Egypt that we find such ephemerals. Mr. Coville\r\nfound them in the Colorado desert in North America. The plants\r\nare quite different, but similar conditions have brought about an\r\nentirely similar mode of life on the other side of the globe! In\r\nColorado they seem to be much influenced by the quantity of rain.\r\nMr. Orcutt, after the great rain of February, 1891, found plants of\r\nAmaranthus (allied to our Love-Lies-Bleeding), which were ten feet\r\nin height, but in 1892 he found specimens of the same in the same\r\nplace only nine inches high, though they were perfect plants and in\r\nfull flower; in this last year there was only the usual very scanty\r\nrainfall.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in deserts when man has set to work and supplies\r\nwater and strenuous labour, that the most wonderful results appear.\r\nThe whole of lower Egypt, Babylon, Nineveh, Damascus, Baghdad,\r\nPalmyra, and other historic cities, show what the desert can be made\r\nto produce.\r\n\r\nAs one slowly steams up the Nile from Philae or Shellal towards Wady\r\nHalfa, there are places where the brown, regular layers of the Nubian\r\nSandstone form cliffs which advance almost to the water's edge. Yet\r\nthere is a narrow strip of green which fringes the water.\r\n\r\nIt is upon the actual bank itself, which is a gentle slope of ten\r\nto fifteen feet, that Lupines, Lubia beans, and other plants are\r\nregularly cultivated. This narrow green ribbon remains almost always\r\non each bank. Where the cliffs recede, one notices a line of tall,\r\ngraceful date palms, mixed occasionally with the branched Dôm palm\r\n(the nut of which yields vegetable ivory).[66] Tamarisks, conspicuous\r\nfor their confused, silvery-green foliage, can be noticed here and\r\nthere. The Acacias are common enough, and sometimes one of them is\r\nused as a hedge. It is a spreading, intricately-branched little\r\nshrub, with very white branches and stout curved thorns.\r\n\r\n  [66] Used to make billiard balls.\r\n\r\nIf one lands and strolls along the banks below the palm trees or\r\namongst plantations of barley, wheat, or lentils, one sees the\r\nnative women in their dark green robes gathering fruits or digging.\r\nGoats and donkeys are tethered here and there. There are sure to be\r\ncastor-oil bushes. Small but neat pigeons, with a chestnut-coloured\r\nbreast and bluish-banded tails are perching on the palms or acacias,\r\nand utter their weak little coo. The air is suffering from the\r\nhorrible creaking and groaning of a \"sakkieh\" water-wheel. This\r\nis made entirely of acacia wood, and is watering the plantations.\r\nSometimes it seems like a crying child, then, perhaps, one is\r\nreminded of the bagpipes, but its most marked peculiarity is the\r\nwearisome iteration. It never stops. One of them is said to supply\r\nabout 1-1/2 acres daily at a cost of seven shillings per diem.\r\nExactly the same instrument can be seen pictured on the monuments of\r\nEgypt 4000 to 5000 years ago. The \"shadouf\" is of still older date.\r\nThis is a long pole bearing at one end a pot or paraffin tin and\r\nbalanced by a mass of dried mud or a stone. All day long a man can\r\nbe seen scooping up the coffee-coloured water of the Nile and pouring\r\nit on the land for the magnificent sum of one piastre a day.\r\n\r\nWhere not irrigated, the soil is dry and parched and can only carry\r\na few miserable little thorny bushes. The entire absence of grass on\r\nthe brick-like soil has a very strange effect to English eyes.\r\n\r\nThe Date Palm, however, requires a little respectful consideration.\r\nIf one enters a thick grove and looks upwards, the idea of Egyptian\r\narchitecture as distinguished from Gothic and others is at once\r\nvisible. It has quite the same effect as the great hall of columns\r\nnear Luxor. The numerous stems ending in the crown at the top where\r\nthe leaves spring off was quite clearly in the minds of the architect\r\nat Karnak and other temples. It goes on bearing its fruits for some\r\ntwo hundred years, and begins to yield when only seven years old.\r\nIt revels in a hot, dry climate with its roots in water, and seems\r\nto require scarcely any care in cultivation. Yet during the first\r\nfew years of its life it is necessary to water the seedling. A\r\nsingle tree may give eight to ten bunches of dates worth about six\r\nshillings. Generally it is reproduced by the suckers which spring out\r\nfrom the base of the tree.\r\n\r\nDates make a very excellent food, not merely pleasant but both\r\nwholesome and nutritious. Sometimes toddy is made by fermenting the\r\nsap, but this is a very wasteful process, as it is apt to kill the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nThe stones are often ground up to make food for camels. The feathery\r\nleaves are exceedingly graceful. When quite young they are not\r\ndivided, but they split down to the main stalk along the folds, so\r\nthat a full-grown leaf affords but little hold to the wind.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Egypt, as for instance at Mariout, which is some\r\nfifteen miles from Alexandria, the wild flowers are probably more\r\nbeautiful than anywhere else in the world. Amongst the corn and\r\nbarley, which can be there grown without irrigation, masses of\r\nscarlet Poppies and Ranunculus are mingled with golden-yellow\r\nComposites, bright purple Asphodels, and hundreds of other Eastern\r\nflowers. The result is a rich feast of colour indescribable and\r\nsatisfying to the soul.\r\n\r\nSo that these deserts under the hand of man rejoice and blossom as\r\nthe rose.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that, as Disraeli has pointed out, civilization, culture,\r\nscience, and religion had their origins in the desert? The answer is\r\nnot difficult to see: for there is a dry, healthy climate; the severe\r\nstrain of a long day's journey is varied by enforced leisure, when,\r\nresting at his tent-door, the Arab is irresistibly compelled to study\r\nthe stars and to contemplate the infinite beauty of the night. It\r\nseems also to have been in the desert of the old world that man first\r\nlearnt to cultivate the soil. In fact, it was only by irrigation on\r\ngreat tracts of alluvium, such as were furnished by the Nile and\r\nEuphrates, that the enormous populations of Egypt, Babylon, Nineveh,\r\nand the other great monarchies could be maintained. So that city life\r\non a big scale first developed there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE FIELDS\r\n\r\n   What was Ancient Britain?--Marshes and\r\n   bittern--Oak forest--Pines--Savage\r\n   country--Cornfield--Fire--Ice--Forest--Worms--Paleolithic\r\n   family--The first farmers--Alfred the Great's first Government\r\n   agricultural leaflet--Dr. Johnson--Prince Charlie's time--Misery\r\n   of our forefathers--Oatmeal, milk, and cabbages--Patrick\r\n   Miller--Tennyson's _Northern Farmer_--Flourishing days of 1830\r\n   to 1870--Derelict farmhouses and abandoned crofts--Where have\r\n   the people gone?--Will they come back?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the eyes of man first beheld Britain, what sort of country was\r\nthis of ours? It is very interesting to try to imagine what it was\r\nlike, but of course it is a very difficult task. Still it is worth\r\nthe attempt, for we ought to know something of what has been done by\r\nour forefathers.\r\n\r\nWhere the great rivers Thames, Humber, Tyne, Forth, Clyde, Mersey,\r\nand Severn, approached the seashore they lost themselves in\r\nwildernesses of desolate, dreary fenlands. Here a small scrubby wood\r\nof willow, birch, and alder; there a miles-wide stretch of reeds\r\nand undrained marsh intersected by sluggish, lazy rivers, or varied\r\nby stagnant pools. The bittern boomed in those marshes. Herons,\r\ngeese, swans, ducks, and aquatic birds of all sorts found what is\r\nnow Chelsea a paradise, only disturbed by the eagle, harrier-hawk,\r\nvulture, and the like.\r\n\r\nNeither at the mouth nor even much higher up in its valley-course,\r\nwas a river a steady stream in a defined bed. Such beds as it had\r\nwere probably four or five times their present width; they would be\r\nquite irregular, meandering about, changing at every flood, full of\r\nislands, loops, backwaters, and continually interrupted by snags of\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe rolling hills of the lowlands would be an almost unbroken forest\r\nof oak, except where perhaps level land and the absence of drainage\r\nproduced a marsh or horrible peat-moss. But when we say forest, we do\r\nnot mean a glorified Richmond Park.\r\n\r\nIn good soil there might indeed be tall and magnificent trees. But it\r\nwould be quite impossible to see them! The giants of the forest would\r\nbe concealed in an inextricable tangle of young trees, brushwood,\r\nfallen logs, creepers, and undergrowth. Where the soil was sandy or\r\nstony, it might be a scrub rather than a forest, of gnarled, twisted,\r\nand stunted oaks, or possibly thickets of sloe, birch, rowan,\r\nhawthorn, brambles, and briers.\r\n\r\nEvery stream would be \"wild water\" leaping down waterfalls and\r\ncutting out irregular, little woody ravines. Here and there boulders\r\nand escarpments of rock would break through the forest soil, which\r\nwould be mossy, thick with undergrowth, and entangled with rotting\r\nfallen trunks and branches, crossing at every conceivable angle. The\r\nhigher hills were covered by a dreary, sombre pine forest. It was of\r\na monotonous, desolate character. Greenish-grey tufts of Old Man's\r\nBeard lichen hung from the branches. The ground, treacherous, and\r\nbroken by boulders, peaty hollows, and dead logs, would be shrouded\r\nin a soft, thick cushion of feathery Mosses, with Blaeberry, Ferns,\r\nTrientalis, Linnea, Dwarf Cornel, and other rare plants. Through\r\nit descended raging and destructive torrents which here might be\r\nchecked and foamed over dead logs, whilst in another place they cut\r\nout bare earth-escarpments or started new waterfalls which ate back\r\ninto the hills behind.\r\n\r\nAt the summit of the higher hills, bare rock crags projected out of\r\noccasional alpine grassy slopes, or irregular terraces, ravines, and\r\ngullies. Below, these alpine ravines ended in a peat-moss, which\r\nscattered, dwarfed, distorted, and miserable-looking Scotch Firs and\r\nBirches painfully endeavoured to colonize. Here and there on very\r\nsteep hillsides, wiry, tussocky grass might be growing instead of\r\nforest or peat.\r\n\r\nA horrible, forbidding, and desolate land, where Deer, Irish elk,\r\nbison, bear, wolf, boar, wolverine, badger, and fox, alone enjoyed\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nNow consider our country to-day. Mark the \"trim little fields\"; \"that\r\nhedge there must have been clipt about eighty years\"; \"The lifting\r\nday showed the stucco villas on the green and the awful orderliness\r\nof England--line upon line, wall upon wall, solid stone dock and\r\nmonolithic pier.\"[67] The road, carefully macadamized, sweeps on\r\ncorrect and straight or gracefully curving from neat village to\r\ncountrytown. In the heart of the country the roadsides are scraped\r\nbare to produce that hideous tidiness which is dear to the soul of\r\nthe County Council roadman. That is if an individual whose life is\r\nspent in stubbing up roses, briers, and every visible wild flower,\r\ncan possibly possess a soul! Those fields without a rock, or even\r\na projecting stone, have been drained, dug over, and levelled with\r\nthe greatest possible care. The very rivers have been straightened\r\nand embanked; the rows of pollarded willows have been planted;\r\nthey may, when in flood, overflow, but the results are very soon no\r\nlonger visible. Even on the moors and in the depths of the Highlands,\r\nblack-faced sheep, draining, and the regular burning of the heather,\r\nhave quite transformed our country.\r\n\r\n  [67] Kipling.\r\n\r\nThe original woods have long since vanished: those which now exist\r\nare mostly quite artificial plantations, and the very trees are often\r\nstrangers to Britain.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Herculean labour by which our country, once as\r\nwild and as savage as its early inhabitants the Icenians and\r\nCatieuchlanians (and probably with lineaments as barbarous as those\r\nof the Coritanian and Trinobant), has been changed to peaceful,\r\nfertile meadowlands or tidy arable, is one long romance. To tell it\r\nproperly would require a book to itself. In this chapter we shall\r\nonly try to sketch what may have happened on one particular cornfield\r\nwhich exists on the trap-rocks of Kilbarchan, near Glasgow.[68] The\r\nreader must bear in mind that even this is a very ambitious attempt!\r\nIt is an exceedingly difficult undertaking.\r\n\r\n  [68] As the story probably differs in detail for every district,\r\n  the author is obliged to confine himself to ground which he has\r\n  actually seen and studied.\r\n\r\nThe subsoil in this particular cornfield (on Pennell Brae) lies upon\r\nthe trap-rock formed by one of those gigantic lava-flows which cover\r\nthat part of Renfrewshire. The whole district at that time must have\r\nbeen exactly like Vesuvius during the late eruption. Its scenery\r\nin this early miocene period consisted of glowing molten rock,\r\naccompanied by flames of fire, electrical storms, clouds of gas,\r\ndust, ashes, and superheated steam.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THEN--\r\n\r\n  A landscape in Ancient Britain.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AND NOW\r\n\r\n  The same landscape at the present time. Notice how the outline\r\n  of the hills has been softened and its shape rounded. The forest\r\n  has almost vanished and the river is bridged and confined within\r\n  definite banks; in fact, only the ravine remains much the same.]\r\n\r\nEvery plant and every animal must have been exterminated. That\r\nwas unfortunate, for, at that time, Pines, Oaks, Guelder Rose,\r\nWillows, as well as Sequoias allied to the Mammoth tree and\r\nSassafras, may have lived in Scotland along with tapirs, opossums,\r\nmarsupials, and other extraordinary beasts.\r\n\r\nWhen the lava cooled and became trap-rock, it was at once attacked\r\nby frost, by wind, and by rain. Then by a very slow process of\r\ncolonization, vegetation slowly and gradually crept over the\r\ntrap-rock and rich mould and plant remains accumulated. At a much\r\nlater date, there was another wholesale destruction. This time, it\r\nwas the great Ice Sheet coming down from the Highland hills. Probably\r\nit drove heavily over the top of Pennell Brae and worked up into fine\r\nmud and powder every vestige of the miocene vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe very rocks themselves would be scratched, polished, and rounded\r\noff. When the glaciers melted away and left the surface free, it\r\nwould consist of these rounded rocks alternating with clay-filled\r\nhollows. The trap-rock below would be covered by a subsoil due to\r\nparticles of trap, of Highland and other mud, with remains of the\r\nmiocene vegetation. Upon this surface, frost, wind, sunshine, and\r\nrain would again begin to perform their work.\r\n\r\nBut the subsoil, thus wonderfully formed by fire in the miocene,\r\nby frost in the glacial, and by weather in our own geological\r\nperiod, very soon felt the protecting and sheltering effect of a\r\nplant-covering.\r\n\r\nFirst a green herb rooted itself every here and there amidst the\r\ndesolate boulder-clay or perhaps in a crevice where good earth had\r\naccumulated. Then the scattered colonists began to form groups; soon\r\npatches of green moss united them. Then a continuous green carpet\r\ncould be traced over a few yards here and perhaps on a few feet\r\nsomewhere else. But when things had got as far as this, progress\r\nbecame much more rapid, and soon the whole site of the future\r\ncornfield was covered over by a continuous green carpet. Only, every\r\nhere and there, hard stones and uncompromising trap-rocks remained\r\nstill protruding from the green covering.\r\n\r\nIn another chapter this first covering of the soil will be described\r\nat length.\r\n\r\nSo far it has been _subsoil_ and _underlying rock_, but now the roots\r\nbegin to disintegrate and work up the subsoil; the earthworm has his\r\nchance, and forms true _soil_. On this particular hillside, the water\r\nwould drain away and there would be no danger of mosses strangling\r\nand choking the Blaeberry and the Heather. The worm flourished and\r\nmultiplied, and the soil became rich and black. Here and there a Sloe\r\nor a Rowan, or Poplar, or perhaps Alder and Birch, began to appear.\r\nIn certain places Whins and Brooms, Brambles and Briers, diversified\r\nthe hillside. Then a few Scotch firs began to push their way up,\r\nthrough the thickets. At first they were very small and stunted, but\r\nas each one formed a dense, deep-going mass of hardy roots, they were\r\nable to investigate the riches of the subsoil. Every year the amount\r\nof leaf-mould above increased, until the original moss-covering was\r\nutterly destroyed and a pine forest (see Chap. XXVIII.) occupied\r\nPennell Brae.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, a paleolithic family may have encamped on the side\r\nof the cliff near a little stream which can still be traced. The camp\r\nwas only a few sticks and branches, with a skin or two for shelter\r\nfrom the north wind. The women lopped down fir branches for firewood,\r\nand cut up the young trees. The children set fire to the shrubs on\r\ndry days and paths ran here and there through the forest. This would\r\nbe about 198,000 B.C.\r\n\r\nEvery year meant a further very gradual, slow destruction of the pine\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nAbout 60,000 B.C., our paleolithic hunters with chipped-stone\r\nweapons would be obliged to travel further to the north. New savages\r\nwith round heads and polished-stone weapons would make life in\r\nRenfrewshire too uncertain and too diversified by massacres. These\r\nlast possessed seed corn, a few fruit trees as well as goats, cattle,\r\nand perhaps a few hardy, shaggy ponies. At first these settlers\r\nwould be obliged to live in a lake dwelling, say in Linwood Moss,\r\nwhich is close at hand. They would then drive their cattle over the\r\nsurrounding district, and camp in slightly-built villages. Near at\r\nhand, probably on the hill, they would build a (round) camp or fort,\r\nwhere they could fly for safety in the continual fights and invasions\r\nof the period.\r\n\r\nSooner or later a village would be built near Pennell Brae. One\r\nsummer day the villagers attacked the wood that covered it; they cut\r\ndown all the small brushwood and hacked through the bark of every big\r\ntree. After a few weeks, when the trees were dead, the wood was set\r\non fire. Then a rough fold made of rude wattle and daub was formed,\r\nand every night the cattle and sheep were driven in.\r\n\r\nAfter three or four years, this fold would be ploughed up by\r\nexceedingly rude instruments. Barley or certain kinds of wheat would\r\nbe grown year after year until the crop was not worth gathering.\r\nWhen that happened, another fold would be ploughed up. Probably the\r\nwhole of Pennell Brae went through this rude sort of agricultural\r\ntreatment at one time or another. At the same time goats, cattle, and\r\nthe demand for firewood, obtained in the most reckless and wasteful\r\nmanner, would have very seriously interfered with the forest.\r\n\r\nAlthough no doubt great changes for the better were introduced, the\r\nspearmen of Wallace of Elderslie close by had their \"infield\" land,\r\nwhich was practically the sheepfold as above described, and their\r\n\"outfield\" or grazing commons. Even down to 1745 the above system was\r\npractised (see below).\r\n\r\nBut when men's minds were stirred up and invigorated by the great\r\nRevolution of 1788-1820, all sorts of new agricultural discoveries\r\nwere made. Yet the cornfield on Pennell Brae was probably not drained\r\nor enclosed by stone walls and hedges until 1830 to 1840! About 1870,\r\nit was more profitable to its owner than it has ever been since,\r\nthough even now it forms part of our British farmlands which yield,\r\non the whole, a larger amount of oats per acre than those of any\r\nother country in the world (except possibly Denmark).\r\n\r\nLet us however look a little closer into the long, long period during\r\nwhich the \"fire and stone-axe methods\" of farming prevailed. Before\r\nthe Romans landed there seem to have been no towns.[69] There was but\r\nlittle cultivation, for the Britons wore skins and lived chiefly on\r\nmilk and flesh.\r\n\r\n  [69] Mr. Chisholm, _Geographical Journal_, November, 1897.\r\n\r\nIn the time of King Alfred, the increase of population made\r\nit necessary to take more trouble about farming, so we find a\r\ndescription of what the good farmer ought to do. We might call this\r\nthe very first Government leaflet, and it has led to the Agricultural\r\nLeaflets published by the Board of Agriculture for Great Britain and\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n\"Sethe wille wyrcan wastbaere lond ateo hin of tham acre aefest sona\r\nfearn and thornas and figrsas swasame weods.\"\r\n\r\nHe was to clear off fern, bracken, thorns, sloe, hawthorn,\r\nbramble, whin, and weeds. The names of the months give some idea of\r\nAnglo-Saxon methods of farming. May was _Thrimylce_, because the\r\ncows might then be milked thrice a day. August was _Weodmonath_\r\n(weed-month), November _Blotmonath_, or blood-month, because the\r\ncattle were then killed to supply salt beef for winter time.[70]\r\n\r\n  [70] Sir H. Maxwell, _Memories of the Months_, First Series.\r\n\r\nVery much later in history, after our English friends had laid\r\nwaste and depopulated Scotland, so that woods sprang up again\r\neverywhere, and again long after that time when the gradual increase\r\nof population had again utterly destroyed those woods, a certain Dr.\r\nJohnson travelled from Carlisle to Edinburgh. This gentleman declared\r\nthat he saw no tree between those places. This statement must not be\r\ntaken too literally, for he had written a dictionary and considered\r\nhimself not merely the _Times_ but an _Encyclopædia Britannica_ as\r\nwell.[71]\r\n\r\n  [71] This may of course have been an exaggeration, a sort of\r\n  joke. But he had no right to make jokes on such a subject.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Dundonald (in 1795) thus describes the agriculture of\r\n1745 (Prince Charlie's days): \"The outfield land never receives any\r\nmanure. After taking from it two or three crops of grain it is left\r\nin the state it was in at reaping the last crop, without sowing\r\nthereon grass-seeds for the protection of any sort of herbage. During\r\nthe first two or three years a sufficiency of grass to maintain a\r\ncouple of rabbits per acre is scarcely produced. In the course of\r\nsome years it acquires a sward, and after having been depastured for\r\nsome years more, it is again submitted to the same barbarous system\r\nof husbandry\" (that is used as a fold and then ploughed up). In the\r\nsame year (1745) in Meigle parish, the land was never allowed to lie\r\nfallow: neither pease, grass, turnips, nor potatoes were raised. No\r\ncattle were fattened. A little grain (oats or barley) was exported.\r\nIn 1754 or thereabouts, there was only one cart in the parish of\r\nKeithhall. Everything was carried about on ponies' backs, as is the\r\ncase nowadays in the most unsettled parts of Canada. The country in\r\nplaces was almost impassable. Bridges did not exist, and the roads\r\nwere mere tracks. In Rannoch the tenants had no beds, but lay on the\r\nground on couches of heather or fern. These houses were built of\r\nwattle and daub, and so low that people had to crawl in on hands and\r\nfeet and could not stand upright.\r\n\r\n\"In the best times that class of people seldom could indulge in\r\nanimal food, and they were in use to support themselves in part with\r\nthe blood taken from their cattle at different periods, made into\r\npuddings or bread with a mixture of oatmeal. Their common diet was\r\neither oatmeal, barley, or bear, cleared of the husks in a stone\r\ntrough by a wooden mallet, and boiled with milk; coleworts or greens\r\nalso contributed much to their subsistence, and cabbages when boiled\r\nand mashed with a little oatmeal.\"[72] Potatoes were introduced in\r\nDumfriesshire some time after 1750, and the use of lime as manure at\r\nabout the same time. Even in 1775 the roads were such that no kind of\r\nloaded carriages could pass without the greatest difficulty.\r\n\r\n  [72] Mr. John Murray, of Murraythwaite, referring probably to\r\n  1780, from Singer, _Agricultural Survey of Dumfriesshire_, 1812.\r\n\r\nThere is a most fascinating account in Dr. Singer's work of a\r\nstrong man's difficulties in starting reasonable agriculture in\r\nDumfriesshire about the year 1785. This was Patrick Miller, of\r\nDalswinton. (It was on Dalswinton Loch that he tried the very first\r\nsteamboat.) \"When I went to view my purchase, I was so much disgusted\r\nfor eight or ten days that I then meant never to return to this\r\ncounty. A trivial accident set me to work, and I have in a great\r\nmanner resided here ever since.... I have now gone over all of this\r\nestate, and this I have done without the aid of a tenant.... I need\r\nnot inform you that the first steps in improvement are draining when\r\nnecessary, inclosing sufficiently, removing stones, roots, rubbish\r\nof every kind, and liming.... These operations cost me, I reckon,\r\nabout £11 per acre upon an average; and I lay my account with being\r\nrepaid all my expenses by the first three crops, but at any rate by\r\nthe fourth. When the land which I make arable will give at least (if\r\nbrought from a state of nature) twenty times the rent when I began to\r\nimprove it.\"\r\n\r\nMajor-General Dirom, of Mount Annan, writing from that place in 1811,\r\nsays that all over Scotland for about thirty years (from 1780-1810)\r\nhe has seen \"cultivation extending from the valleys to the hills,\r\ncommons inclosed, wastes planted, and heaths everywhere giving way to\r\ncorn: ... extension of towns and villages, by new lines of excellent\r\nroads, magnificent bridges and inland navigation ... our rapidly\r\nincreasing population, by our now exporting great quantities of grain\r\nfrom parts of Scotland into which it was formerly imported, and by\r\nthe superior comfort and abundance which appear in the domestic\r\neconomy of the inhabitants.\" If you read any newspaper of to-day\r\npublished in Canada or in the Argentine Republic, you find exactly\r\nthe same process at work, and the same enthusiasm about it. Even in\r\n1840-1850 all these improvements were still vigorously going on.\r\n\r\nLook at Tennyson's _Northern Farmer_ (old style):--\r\n\r\n                    \"'An I a stubb'd Thurnaby waäste.\r\n    Dobbut looök at the waäste, theer warnt no feeäd for a cow,\r\n    Nowt at all but bracken an fuzz, an looök at it now.\r\n    Warnt worth nowt a haäcre and now there's lots o feeäd,\r\n    Four scoor yows upon it an some on it down i seeäd.\"\r\n\r\nEven in his days, the good farmer was following King Alfred's\r\ndirections. About 1830-1850 most of the land was in good bearing, and\r\nthe roads were sufficiently good to admit of the stage-coach with\r\nfour horses. But they after all lasted but a very short time before\r\nthe railways again entirely altered the conditions of country life.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, rents were in places, five times as large in\r\n1820-1830 as they had ever been previously.[73] Therefore it was that\r\nabout this time the gentlemen's houses were in many places rebuilt\r\non a more magnificent scale. Then also were begun those circles and\r\nstrips, or belts of plantation, which are now conspicuous features\r\nof the Scotch lowlands. An enormous majority of these plantations\r\nare not more than eighty years old. I think avenues were planted in\r\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The fashion about 1820 was\r\nto destroy them as unnatural, at least in England. Unfortunately no\r\nrespect was paid to the economic practice of forestry, with very\r\nunfortunate results for the proprietor.\r\n\r\n  [73] The agricultural rents in Dumfriesshire were valued in 1656\r\n  at £13,225, in 1790-1800 as £109,700, in 1808 £219,037 10s. 8d.\r\n  In 1905 the value per acre was from £1 to £2.\r\n\r\nThe rest of this chapter is necessarily unpleasant and distressing\r\nreading, but it is necessary if we are to understand the romance\r\nof the fields. As one wanders over the grassy pastures of Southern\r\nScotland, where the black-faced sheep foolishly start away, and where\r\none's ears are irritated by the scolding complaints of the curlew\r\nor whaup, it is no rare accident to find a few broken-down walls, a\r\nclump of nettles, and badly grown ash trees. That was once a farm\r\nsteading, where a healthy troop of children used to play together\r\nafter walking three or more miles barefoot to school. The ash trees\r\nwere planted at every farm \"toon,\" for the Scottish spear was a very\r\nnecessary weapon until recent times. Often also, upon some monotonous\r\ngrouse moor, one sees the ridges that betoken a little croft where a\r\ncottager lived.\r\n\r\nIn one parish (Troqueer) over seventy country cottages have been\r\nabandoned during the lifetime of a middle-aged person.\r\n\r\nMany families, of which the laird was often the best farmer in the\r\ndistrict and his own factor, have disappeared. The fine houses, with\r\ntheir parks and shootings, are let to strangers, who come for a few\r\nweeks or months, and then leave it in charge of a caretaker. Before\r\nthis recent development, the \"family\" lived all the year round upon\r\nthe land; they spent their income chiefly in wages to the country\r\npeople. Where once forty or fifty people were employed all the year,\r\nthere are now but three or four. The big house with shuttered windows\r\nand weed-grown walks, is a distressing and saddening spectacle.\r\n\r\nOf course such changes must occur. The farmer's and the cottar's\r\nchildren are now carrying out in Canada, Australia, or the United\r\nStates, what was done in Scotland from 1780-1830. India, South\r\nAfrica, and China have been developed by the brains and hold the\r\ngraves of many of the laird's sons.\r\n\r\nYet this poor old country, abandoned of her children, shows signs of\r\nrevival. Both the poor and the rich are beginning to find out that a\r\ncountry life is healthier, quite as interesting, and sometimes quite\r\nas profitable as the overcrowded city with its manufactories, mills,\r\nand offices. All new countries are beginning to fill up, and there\r\nis some hope that a new and vigorous development of farming may make\r\nthe countryside once more vigorous, prosperous, and full of healthy\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nON PLANTS WHICH ADD TO CONTINENTS\r\n\r\n   Lake Aral and Lake Tschad--Mangrove swamps of West\r\n   Africa--New mudbanks colonized--Fish, oysters, birds,\r\n   and mosquitoes--Grasping roots and seedlings--Extent\r\n   of mangroves--Touradons of the Rhone--Sea-meadows of\r\n   Britain--Floating pollen--Reeds and sedges of estuarine\r\n   meadows--Storms--Plants on ships' hulls--Kelps and tangles in\r\n   storms--Are seaweeds useless?--Fish.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way in which the savage, rugged, inhospitable Britain of the Ice\r\nAge changed into our familiar peaceful country formed the subject of\r\nthe last chapter.\r\n\r\nBut plants do far more than cover the earth and render it fertile,\r\nfor some of them assist in winning new land from the sea or from\r\nfreshwater lakes. The Sea of Aral, for instance, or Lake Tschad are\r\nrapidly becoming choked up by reeds and other vegetation. Blown sand\r\nfrom the deserts around is caught and intercepted by these reeds, so\r\nthat fertile pastures are gradually forming in what used to be the\r\nopen water of a deepish lake.\r\n\r\nBy far the most extraordinary of all these plants which form new land\r\nare the Mangroves.\r\n\r\nThey are only found in the tropics or sub-tropical regions, and are\r\nalways along the sea-coast. It is where a river ends in a delta,\r\ndividing into intricate and confused irregularly winding creeks, that\r\nthe mangroves are especially luxuriant.\r\n\r\nSuch a river will have probably flowed through hundreds of miles of\r\nthe most exuberant tropical forest, where growth is never checked by\r\nthe cold grasp of winter.\r\n\r\nIts waters are yellowish brown or _café au lait_ coloured, because\r\nthey are full of mud and of decaying vegetation, with dead leaves and\r\ndecaying branches floating on the surface. So full are such rivers of\r\ndecaying material that they have a distinct and unmistakable smell,\r\nwhich has been compared to \"crushed marigolds.\"\r\n\r\nSo soon as the muddy water reaches the sea, most of its mud is\r\ndeposited and forms great banks and shoals of shifting odoriferous\r\nslime, which confuses and interferes with the discharging mouths of\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nIt is upon these changing, horrible-smelling banks of bottomless\r\nslime that the Mangrove is especially intended to develop.\r\n\r\nIf one takes a canoe in such a delta and paddles inwards on the\r\nincoming tide, a dense forest of glossy-green mangroves will be found\r\nto cover the whole coast-line, and also to extend far inland by the\r\nwinding creeks, lagoons, and river channels.\r\n\r\nThe whole theory of the mangroves becomes clearly revealed as soon\r\nas the water begins to sink at low tide. First one notices that the\r\nstem of every mangrove ends below, not in a single trunk, but in an\r\nenormous number of arched, stilt-like supporting roots. Not only the\r\nstem but the branches also give off descending roots, which branch\r\ninto four or five grasping arched fingers as soon as they get near\r\nthe water. When they reach the mud, these fingers grow down into it\r\nand form a new supporting root to the tree. It is very difficult\r\nto give any idea of the extraordinary appearance of these mangrove\r\nroots.\r\n\r\nImagine an orchard of very old apple trees in winter, and suppose\r\nthat one were to cut off every tree and plant it upside down in\r\nblack mud, and also to crowd them so closely together that the\r\nbranches were all mixed and confused. This may give an idea of the\r\nodd and strange appearance of the root-system in a mangrove forest.\r\nUpon these arching roots, even on those which are not yet attached,\r\nmultitudes of oysters may be seen. There is also a little fish (a\r\nsort of perch) which climbs up on to the roots or out of the mud\r\nbelow, and gasps or squatters about in it.\r\n\r\nAs to the mud itself, it is a horrible, greasy, oozy, black or\r\nblue-black slime of bottomless depth. \"It is full of organic,\r\nputrefying, strongly-smelling material, clearly full of bacteria.\r\nThe water itself is sometimes covered by a dirty, oily scum, and\r\nair-bubbles rising from the bottom, spread out on the surface and\r\nlet loose their microbes in the atmosphere.\"[74] There are many\r\ncrocodiles, which may be seen reposing on the mud above high tide. It\r\nis difficult to distinguish them from a rough log of wood, but it is\r\nstill more difficult to kill them, for their scales turn any ordinary\r\nbullet. There is scarcely any experience more exasperating than when,\r\nafter one has taken a long, careful, and accurate aim, one observes\r\nthe sleeping brute suddenly wake and scurry down into the water with\r\na hideous leer on its face. Sea-cows or manatees are said to live\r\nin these creeks. Little ducks of many kinds rise in hundreds and\r\nthousands, but the commonest bird is the \"curlew\" (either a whimbrel\r\nor closely allied to it). During the day they sift the mud with\r\ntheir long curved beaks for insects, and at sunset fly down in vast\r\nnumbers to the mudbanks near the sea. A miserable little white crane\r\ncalled \"Poor Joe\" is common, and has the same habit. It is not worth\r\nshooting, and it is quite aware of the fact. Herons, cormorants,\r\nand other birds are often to be seen. Monkeys sometimes visit the\r\nmangroves, probably to eat oysters or crabs. There are several kinds\r\nof crablike creatures which climb up the roots and may be seen\r\nrunning about all over them. But during the three weeks spent by the\r\nwriter in the Mahéla creeks of Sierra Leone, it was the insects that\r\nmade the deepest impression upon him; as soon as the evening falls\r\nthe mosquitoes appear in myriads and in millions. Such creeks and\r\nmangrove swamps are always feverstricken and dangerous, and probably\r\nenjoy the very worst climate in the whole world. Of course nowadays,\r\nwhen Sir Patrick Manson and Dr. Ross have discovered that the\r\nmosquito carries the malaria germ, it is possible with great care to\r\nguard against malaria. One has also the satisfaction of knowing that\r\nthe mosquito itself cannot be perfectly at ease with all these tiny\r\nparasites attacking its digestive organs.\r\n\r\n  [74] Warming, _Lehrbuch der OEcol Pfl. Geog._\r\n\r\nAt first sight such swamps appear to be useless, impossible, and\r\ndangerous. But that is not the case. No one, of course, would ever\r\nwillingly reside in mangrove swamps, and the mangroves themselves are\r\nof scarcely any use to man, although the bark does sometimes furnish\r\na useful tanning material; but, indirectly, the mangroves are one of\r\nthe most important of all Nature's geographical agents.\r\n\r\nOn those horrible, slimy, shifting mudbanks no other plants could\r\nmanage to exist. If one looks carefully at the seaward side of the\r\nlast of the mangrove swamps, then it is easy to see that they are\r\ncolonizing and reclaiming the mud.\r\n\r\nNot only do the roots depending from the branches grasp and colonize\r\nnew mud, but the seedlings are also specially adapted to fulfil the\r\nsame office.\r\n\r\nThey remain a long time attached to the parent fruit; they also grow\r\nto a considerable length before they fall off. When ready to fall,\r\nthey have a distinct seedling stem, which swells out towards the\r\nbase and ends in a pointed root. The seedling is, in fact, like a\r\nclub hanging upside down and with a pointed end. When it does fall,\r\nit goes straight down deep into the mud; then it promptly forms some\r\nanchoring roots, and the young mangrove is fixed in new mud and\r\nbegins to develop. So that the forest continually grows towards the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nSuch mudbanks soon become pierced by roots in every direction. Then\r\nthe leaves of the mangroves themselves, as well as silt, soil, and\r\nrubbish floating in the water, gradually accumulate about and around\r\nthese roots. This must raise the level of the ground. Eventually\r\nthe soil becomes hardened and is above the level of the water. When\r\nthis happens, the mangrove, which likes salt water about its roots,\r\nbecomes unhealthy and the ordinary jungle trees kill it and take its\r\nplace. Thus in course of time, when the jungle is cleared, fertile\r\nricefields may be thriving on what was once a pure, or rather impure,\r\nmudbank.\r\n\r\nIn this way, by the continual development of the mangroves, enormous\r\nstretches of land are being added to the continents, and the process\r\ncontinues so long as the character of the coast-line favours it.\r\n\r\nThe shore-line covered by these mangrove swamps is enormous. In\r\nfact, within the tropics one finds them almost everywhere along the\r\nseashore, but coral, rock, or an exceedingly dry climate such as that\r\nof Arabia or Northern Peru, prevents their growth. Central and South\r\nAmerica, West and East Africa, India, Polynesia, Australia, and much\r\nof the Asiatic coast-line, is covered by mangroves.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & Underwood_\r\n  _London and New York_\r\n\r\n  A RICEFIELD IN CHINA\r\n\r\n  The proprietor and two of his coolies are in front of the paddy\r\n  field. The young rice plants can be seen growing in the water.]\r\n\r\nTheophrastus speaks of those in the Persian gulf, and that\r\nexceedingly shrewd botanist has some valuable notes about them worth\r\nreading even to-day.[75]\r\n\r\n  [75] Drude, _l.c._; Schimper, _l.c._; Warming, _l.c._; _Colonial\r\n  Reports_, No. 3, Miscellaneous. Schimper, _Indo-Malayische\r\n  Strandflora_.\r\n\r\nIn temperate countries, such as our own, the districts where great\r\nrivers enter the sea are for the most part aguish and rheumatic, but,\r\nof course, there is nothing so startling and extraordinary as the\r\nmangrove swamps.\r\n\r\nYet, even in temperate countries, the work of winning or gaining\r\nnew land plods steadily onwards, and it is performed by humble,\r\ninconspicuous little plants.\r\n\r\nWhere the Rhone enters the Mediterranean, there are some 40,000 acres\r\nof sandy and clayey land called the Camargue. The bare sand near the\r\nsea is often flooded and swept by violent storms in winter; anything\r\nwhich tries to grow there is usually carried[75-b] off and destroyed.\r\n\r\n    [note 75-b] Drude, _l.c._; Schimper, _l.c._; Warming, _l.c._; _Colonial\r\n    Reports_, No. 3, Miscellaneous. Schimper, _Indo-Malayische\r\n    Strandflora_.\r\n\r\nBut, after a time, one finds here and there a solitary plant of a\r\nkind of Saltwort (_Salicornia macrostachya_) which has withstood the\r\nstrain: its branches gather a little sand and hold it together, and\r\nits roots gradually explore and tie down the soil around it. Next\r\nwinter it can stand the sweep and scour of the stormy water; next\r\nsummer other plants begin to grow on this tiny sand-heap, and the\r\n\"touradon,\" as it is called, is now fairly well established. It goes\r\non growing until it may be, after a few years, six feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nEventually the salt gets washed out of the soil and these little\r\nheaps become united by a continuous covering of green plants in which\r\nshrubs and then trees begin to grow.[76] By this time of course the\r\nsand has accumulated farther out to sea and the same process is going\r\non there.\r\n\r\n  [76] Flahault, after Schimper, _l.c._\r\nIn Britain we have the \"sea meadows\" of Sea-grass, which covers the\r\nsubmerged sand and mudbanks near the mouths of great rivers.\r\n\r\nThe waving green grasslike leaves form a rich submarine meadow. They\r\nare used for stuffing pillows and cushions, especially in Venice, but\r\ntheir real importance in the world depends upon their being able to\r\ntie down and fix permanently those unseen shifting banks which form a\r\nreal danger to all navigation.\r\n\r\nThese plants are very remarkable. They lived, no doubt, at one time\r\non the land, like most of the flowering plants. But, like the whale\r\nand the seal, they have been driven to take refuge below the ocean.\r\nThey are not easily seen, and, indeed, one may wander for years along\r\nthe sea-coast and never suspect that great meadows of Zostera (the\r\nEelwrack, Grasswrack, or Sea-grass) are flourishing under water.\r\n\r\nBut, one might ask, how is the pollen of its flowers carried?\r\nObviously neither insects nor the wind can be of any service. The\r\npollen of Zostera is, however, of the same weight exactly as the\r\nwater, so that it neither rises to the surface nor sinks to the\r\nbottom, but floats to and fro until it reaches the outspread styles\r\nof another plant. This is perhaps the most remarkable arrangement\r\nknown for the carrying of pollen.\r\n\r\nSometimes along the seashore, or especially on the muddy foreshore\r\nof an estuary or tidal river, one can watch those plants which are\r\ntrying to form new land. One finds generally that there is a broad\r\nstretch of marshy meadow interrupted and intersected by small ditches\r\nand little winding streams. As one gets towards the shore, Sea-pink,\r\nScurvy-grass, an Aster, and other plants, not to be found elsewhere,\r\nbecome common. Then stretching out into the mud there are rows of\r\ncurious reeds and sedges.\r\n\r\nTry to pull up one of these reeds, and you will find a strong,\r\nburied, stringy stem, with hundreds of anchoring roots. These are the\r\npioneers which first fix the sand.\r\n\r\nOver the surface of the sand between these upright stems, one often\r\ncomes upon a most beautiful, glossy, dark-green, velvety cushion.\r\nIt is composed of a seaweed called Vaucheria, whose twined and\r\ninterlaced threads form a thick, silky cushion. But it is only\r\nbeautiful to look at from above. If you pull up a piece of this\r\ncushion, you will find that it is growing on black and loathly mud,\r\nwith many wriggling worms and horrible animalcula. First these\r\npioneer reeds, then this soft, silky carpet of vaucheria, and then\r\nthe sea-pinks and other estuarine marsh flowers gradually creep\r\nforward and extend over the bare muddy sand, so winning it from the\r\nsea for the use of cattle.\r\n\r\nIn the worst winter storms, when the waves are thundering heavily\r\nover these sands, it seems as if nothing could resist them. Yet if\r\nyou go down when the storm is over, no harm has been done: there is\r\nthe silky green cushion of vaucheria, and there are the lines of\r\npioneer sedges and reeds quite undisturbed!\r\n\r\nThe reeds bend and sway, yielding to the water; the seaweed is slimy\r\nand oily, and the water cannot injure it. But yet the strength of\r\nthese seaweeds is extraordinary, and, indeed, almost incredible.\r\n\r\nMore remarkable still, perhaps, are those seaweeds which grow upon\r\nrocks, often where the full strength of the waves beats upon them.\r\nAfter a heavy storm, when, perhaps, the great timbers of groins and\r\nthe heavy concrete blocks of an esplanade have been shattered to\r\npieces and tossed all over the shore, one may go down to the shore\r\nand there will be no visible difference in the kelps and tangles of\r\nthe rocks. Scarcely any seem to have been broken away. Indeed, if\r\none looks in the rubbish left by the last high tide, one finds that\r\nwhen one of these Alarias has been broken away, it is often because\r\nthe stone itself has been torn out of the rock! One finds broken off\r\nstones with the seaweed still attached to them.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the outside of the seaweed is oily, slimy,\r\nor slippery, so that the water gets no hold of it. The stem and\r\nsubstance is also elastic and surprisingly strong, so that the daily\r\ntossing and wrenching when the tides come in and go out has no effect\r\nin tearing it away.\r\n\r\nBut if you go down to a dry dock and look at the hull of a ship\r\nwhich has come in to be cleaned and scraped, you will see that it is\r\nentirely covered by seaweeds and shells.\r\n\r\nThat ship has been driven through the water perhaps at ten miles an\r\nhour or more, and yet those delicate-looking seaweeds have held on!\r\nIt is more surprising still if you can get some of them and examine\r\nthem with a microscope, for amongst them are tiny, delicate, graceful\r\nlittle fronds and sprays which one would think consisted of nothing\r\nbut jelly. Yet they have been able to thrive and grow on the ship's\r\nhull while it has been hurrying day and night through the sea, in\r\ncalm or in tempest, and in currents of hot or cold water.\r\n\r\nThose seaweeds were called by Horace _Algæ inutiles_, or useless\r\nseaweeds; but are they useless?\r\n\r\nGo down to a little pool and watch them waving in the water. Could\r\nanything be more beautiful than these little graceful red, yellow,\r\nor brown sprays? All sorts of seaslugs, shrimps, and minute animals\r\nof weird and wonderful design are clearly living on them. Fishes live\r\nupon these animals, and fishes are an extremely useful and excellent\r\nfood for man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nROCKS, STONES, AND SCENERY\r\n\r\n   An old wall--Beautiful colours--Insects--Nature's\r\n   chief aim--Hard times of lichens--Age of\r\n   lichens--Crusts--Mosses--Lava flows of great\r\n   eruptions--Colonizing plants--Krakatoa--Vesuvius--Greenland\r\n   volcanoes--Sumatra--Shale-heaps--Foreigners on railway\r\n   lines--Plants keep to their own grounds--Precipices and\r\n   rocks--Plants which change the scenery--Cañons in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first sight, and when one is striding along at some four miles an\r\nhour, there seems to be nothing at all interesting in an old wall.\r\nBut if one stops and carefully examines the stones, there is a great\r\ndeal that is interesting.\r\n\r\nRocks and walls possess a fascination of their own. Probably at least\r\n2000 British plants are _only_ found upon them, and yet of these, the\r\nvast majority are so small and inconspicuous that an ordinary person\r\nnever perceives a single one of them.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps on rocks or old walls near the sea that this stone\r\nflora is most richly developed. The nearly circular orange-yellow\r\npatches of the Lichen _Physcia parietina_ are quite distinct and\r\nconspicuous. But any old wall, provided it is well out in the\r\ncountry, is pretty sure to be interesting.\r\n\r\nAt first it seems to have only a dull grey or neutral tint. But if\r\none goes to four or five feet distance, one discovers that many\r\nshades of brown, red, white, and black go to make this grey.\r\n\r\nBut the extraordinary beauty of such a wall is only visible when one\r\npeers and scrutinizes the surface very slowly and carefully with the\r\neyes six or seven inches away from it.\r\n\r\nIn doing this, one is often troubled by rude and ribald boys. A\r\nbotanical friend indeed complained that he had been for months\r\navoided and shunned as a dangerous wandering lunatic on account\r\nof his botanical enthusiasm. But true botanists get accustomed to\r\ndisagreeable incidents like that, and pay no attention to the vulgar\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\nThe change in an old wall when one looks at it from a few inches\r\ndistance is most remarkable. The entire surface is spotted or dusted,\r\nsprinkled or entirely covered by thick lichen stains and crusts.\r\n\r\nThe original colour of the stone is nowhere visible. The lichens show\r\nthe most delicate shades and contrasts in colour; all pleasing and\r\nall blending together in harmonious general tones. The fruit of these\r\nlichens is like a minute saucer or platter generally with a thin rim\r\nor border, but it is exceedingly small, probably only one-sixteenth\r\nof an inch in diameter, or even less. The smallest of these crust\r\nlichens form continuous, very thin, coatings, covering the stone; and\r\nagainst this background the little saucer-like fruits show up quite\r\ndistinctly.\r\n\r\nThe coating itself varies from \"bright yellow, pale ochre, citron,\r\nchestnut colour, to mouse colour, different shades of grey and green,\r\ncream colour, lead colour, blue-black or pure black, tawny, brown,\r\nrusty red or pure white.\" The cups of one kind (_Lecidea_[77]) are\r\nblack, whilst those of _Lecanora_ are generally reddish-brown. But\r\nthey may be a ghostly pale hue which stands out plainly against the\r\ngrey-green background of the frond.\r\n\r\n  [77] _Lecidea_ has at least 230 species on British stones and\r\n  rocks (Leighton).\r\n\r\nSometimes they are of the richest deep crimson or lake, set against\r\na pure snow-white crust. Those of _Lecanora vitellina_ are, though\r\ntiny, a brilliant yellow, and quite startling when first one notices\r\nthem. Many of these contrasts and shades are never used by artists,\r\nand even from the mere artistic point of view they have great\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nBut if, after spending a few minutes in carefully looking over the\r\nrocks at a distance of six or seven inches, one stands up and goes\r\nback to four or five feet away, the whole of this colour scheme fades\r\naway and there is only the monotonous indeterminate grey or neutral\r\ntint of the wall.\r\n\r\nNow why is this? Why should these delicate and exquisite shades be\r\nwasted on such minute and scarcely distinguishable forms?\r\n\r\nThere are always two sides from which one can look at any subject,\r\nnamely the _inside_ and the _outside_.\r\n\r\nFrom the inside (that is from the point of view of the little lichen\r\nitself) these colours are decidedly useful. Small insects crawl about\r\non such walls or hover a few inches in front of them, and to those\r\ninsects these cups will be as conspicuous and attractive as a scarlet\r\ngeranium is to ourselves.\r\n\r\nJust as we habitually go to look at a geranium, so those insects fly\r\ntowards the cups and crawl about on them. Then when the spores and\r\ndust of the lichen begin to stick in their hairs and feet, they go to\r\na bare place and clean or brush them off. Thus the spores and dust\r\nare carried to a new part of the rock, where they will grow if they\r\ncan find an unoccupied place. The taste in colour of these insects,\r\nmoreover, is apparently not very different from that of man.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps a still more interesting point of view is that from the\r\noutside. Why are those lichens there? What are they doing, and are\r\nthey of any use?\r\n\r\nThe general scheme of Nature is to cover the whole world with green,\r\nso that every ray of sunlight may find a working leaf or green frond\r\nready to welcome it and use it. Nature abhors bare rock, barren sand,\r\nand empty water, and never ceases to try to bring it under that\r\nbeautiful covering of green plants and active vegetable life which\r\nsupports both man and animals.\r\n\r\nWe all know that there is a romance in the story of man's colonies.\r\nFirst the explorer searches out the country; then the pioneer\r\nfrontiersman settles and builds his log-hut or rough shanty. Next\r\ncomes the frontier village, which may perhaps in many years' time\r\nbecome a crowded city where active, valuable work is carried on.\r\n\r\nThe story of the colonizing of rocks and stones by plants is just\r\nas vividly interesting. These tiny lichens are almost the first\r\npioneers, and prepare the ground for those that follow. Upon that\r\nbare rock, life is terribly severe. The frost shatters it, sunshine\r\nheats it until it almost burns the hand in summer. Floods of rain or\r\nof sleet beat against it, and it may be frozen over for weeks.\r\n\r\nWhat plant can stand such conditions? Only these minute, tiny, scarce\r\nvisible lichen films!\r\n\r\nGradually new lichen crusts develop upon it. They cover over the\r\nfirst pioneers; first they suffocate them and afterwards devour their\r\nremains. Nature is very businesslike and severe in her working. The\r\nlichen crust may be now about one-sixteenth of an inch thick. It is\r\na very slow process. There is a story of a boy who noticed a patch\r\nof lichen near his father's door. He went away to Kamschatka or\r\nsomewhere and came back a very old man of eighty-five years; but he\r\nfound that the lichen patch was just the same size as when he went\r\naway. That, however, is just a story!\r\n\r\nAt any rate, one of these little crust-lichens called _Variolaria_\r\nhas been known to increase half a millimetre in size (about a\r\nsixtieth part of an inch) between the end of February and that of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nNow if one tries to realize what the life of such a lichen crust\r\nor crottle must be, it is obvious that the stone below it must be\r\na little corroded or weathered, and remains of the first choked\r\npioneers, bacteria, and possibly tiny insects or animalcula will be\r\nunder the crust, which may now be one-sixteenth of an inch thick.\r\n\r\nIt is the turn now of other lichens to colonize it. These may be the\r\nlittle trumpet or horn and cup lichens, _Cladonias_, or perhaps the\r\nlarger grey kinds, _Parmelias_ and _Physcias_, which have leaf-like\r\nfronds and form circles of perhaps eight to ten inches in diameter.\r\nThe crust-lichen is overgrown, broken up, disorganized, and devoured\r\nby the _Parmelias_ and _Cladonias_, who are helped by bacteria,\r\ninsects, and animalcula which shelter below them. These leafy lichens\r\ngrow much more rapidly.\r\n\r\nThey may increase two-thirds of an inch in one year.\r\n\r\nBut very soon after this, one notices a few inconspicuous green\r\nmosses; at first in crevices between the stones or in hollows,\r\nand not remarkable, they soon increase and form trailing sprays\r\nor branches which grow very quickly. Branches of moss four or\r\nfive inches long extend over the leafy lichens in a season. The\r\n_Parmelias_ and _Cladonias_ struggle on, but they cannot keep pace\r\nwith the rapid life of the moss, and soon our wall is covered by\r\nbeautiful moss turfs.\r\n\r\nUnderneath such a turf there may be an inch or so of good soil (dead\r\nmoss and dust with lichen and insect bodies). Worms, insects, etc.,\r\nshelter and flourish and multiply in this soil.\r\n\r\nBut the turn of the moss is coming. Here a few grass-blades, there\r\na tiny plant of Sandwort, possibly a Rock Bedstraw, begin to root\r\nthemselves in the moss.\r\n\r\nIf people would only let the wall alone, it would soon be festooned\r\nwith hanging plants, and producing quantities of grass, but somebody\r\nis sure to find that it looks very untidy, and everything is torn off\r\nthe wall, which again looks new and raw and clean. Then of course the\r\npioneer lichens begin again!\r\n\r\nSome very interesting and remarkable facts have been discovered about\r\nthe way in which lavas and basalts have been occupied by the plant\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIn the great volcanic eruption of 1883, the whole island of Krakatoa\r\nwas covered by hot lava and glowing ashes. In 1884 and 1885 the\r\nsunsets were remarkable for a curious fiery red or orange glow,\r\nwhich was popularly supposed to be due to the volcanic dust of that\r\nexplosion. It is said that the dust travelled three times round the\r\nearth, though I do not know on what authority.\r\n\r\nHowever, on Krakatoa island there was left a clean \"slate.\" There\r\nwere neither bacteria, nor leaf-mould, nor living plants of any\r\nkind; no spores or seeds could have endured the fiery furnace of the\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nThree years afterwards the botanist Treub visited the island. He\r\nfound that the rocks had been first covered by thin layers of minute\r\nfreshwater Algæ, but that ferns were then occupying and inhabiting\r\nthe lavas. Eleven kinds of ferns, and but very few other plants, were\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nPeople were interested in this, and Dr. A. F. W. Schimper then\r\nvisited another volcano which had been pouring out huge streams of\r\nlava in 1843. He found that there were still plenty of ferns, but\r\nalso numbers of shrubs and other plants. Yet even then there were\r\nno trees, and there was no continuous mantle of green plants such\r\nas we are accustomed to in this country. He also found many plants\r\ngrowing on the lava which are generally found on the branches of\r\ntrees, that is, which can do without a thick layer of soil. He also\r\nfound quantities of a pitcher plant, Nepenthes (which lives mainly on\r\ninsects caught in its pitchers).\r\n\r\nThis does not at first sight seem to agree at all with what has been\r\ngiven for the walls. It is true that sometimes in the Highlands,\r\nor Lowland and Lakeland Hills, one comes across quantities of the\r\nBladderfern and others growing on the \"screes.\" (These last may\r\nbe described as streams of broken, angular stones, filling small\r\ngullies, and spreading out at the base over a considerable space.)\r\nOften these ferns seem to be all that can thrive in amongst the\r\nstones. But in a mild and temperate country like our own, one would\r\nexpect things to proceed differently.\r\n\r\nAnd in fact they do so. Every one must have noticed a green stain\r\nwhich covers wet walls, stones, stucco, even marble statues, and\r\nespecially tree bark in wet or damp situations. This is a minute\r\ngreen seaweed rejoicing in the name of Pleurococcus. It is a pretty\r\nobject for the microscope.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, is the first stage of colonization. It is followed\r\nby mosses of sorts.\r\n\r\nBut there is a more interesting series still in a climate resembling\r\nour own. The lava-flows from Mount Vesuvius have been investigated by\r\nseveral observers.\r\n\r\nThere it was found that the first inhabitants were _lichens_ and\r\nsmall green seaweeds; then \"different mosses occupied the lava over\r\nwhich a certain quantity of vegetable dust had been scattered.\" After\r\nthis, scattered ferns and even small shrubs could be seen even on\r\nflows which were red-hot only twenty years before, whilst on old\r\nlava-fields herbs, shrubs, bushes, trees, and even true woods had\r\ndeveloped.[78]\r\n\r\n  [78] Engler, _Humboldt's Centenaarschrift_, 1889.\r\n\r\nYet in Greenland lava-flows dating from 1724-29 are still only\r\ncovered by crust-lichens and a very few of the stone-mosses! In\r\nSumatra, on the other hand, the volcano of Tamboro, which in 1815\r\nhad entirely destroyed its vegetation, was covered with a fine young\r\nwood in 1874![79] The strong heat and abundant moisture of Sumatra\r\nfavours, whilst the horrible climate of Greenland prevents, the rapid\r\ngrowth of good soil. Just as cities of 20,000 inhabitants can spring\r\nup in a few months in the Western United States, whilst the Esquimaux\r\nof Greenland have not managed as yet even to live in villages!\r\n\r\n  [79] Warming, _Lehrbuch der Oekol. Pfl. Geog._\r\n\r\nThe full beauty of this gradual colonization and occupation of bare\r\nrock and stones only impresses one properly if one tries to trace the\r\nstages, but it is an interesting history.\r\n\r\nNear Glasgow one sees great heaps of shale or blaes (generally\r\n_blackband_), which are often mistaken for natural hills. This is or\r\nwas virgin soil, never occupied by plants, and entirely destitute of\r\nleaf-mould or any sort of organic plant-food.\r\n\r\nIf one scrambles to the top of one of these heaps, it is easy to\r\nsee all the details of the occupation. Long underground runners of\r\ncoltsfoot and of horsetail are climbing up the sides, fringes of\r\ncreeping buttercup, couchgrass, and other hardy weeds occupy, every\r\nyear, a little more of the flanks, but, on the top, one very soon\r\nfinds that the dust of the atmosphere, aided by weathering, has\r\nafforded a chance to mosses, to hawkweeds, and other rock plants.\r\nThese in time cover the top, and soon hardy grasses and weeds form a\r\nregular turf on the top of the shale.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to scramble to the top of one of these heaps,\r\nespecially in summer. One then begins to realize how every plant\r\nattends strictly to its own business.\r\n\r\nAll over the sides of the heap there will be hundreds of a rare\r\ngroundsel (_Senecio viscosus_), which is not really a native, and\r\n_never_ occurs except on such places. In a grass field close by\r\nhundreds of thousands of Ragwort (_Senecio jacobæa_) make a glorious\r\ngolden carpet; in the marshy part of the meadow the Water Ragwort\r\n(_Senecio aquaticus_) may be found. In the cottage gardens and here\r\nand there along the roadside the groundsel (_Senecio vulgaris_) is\r\nflourishing abundantly.\r\n\r\nThese plants never interfere with or encroach upon one another's\r\ngrounds. Every year thousands of ragweed and groundsel seeds must be\r\nblown on to the shale-heap, but they never manage to grow there.\r\n\r\nIt is only the foreigner (_S. viscosus_), accustomed to a very hot\r\nand dry climate, and with sticky leaves which catch atmospheric dust\r\nand probably insects, that can exist on the bare shaly sides. These\r\nslopes of shale are easily heated by the sun, and at the same time\r\nradiate the heat rapidly away, so that the Viscid Groundsel must have\r\na very hard time of it. When its roots have worked up the shale a\r\nlittle, and its dead leaves have covered the surface with mould and\r\norganic matter, then possibly others (true British plants) can get a\r\nfooting and suppress it.\r\n\r\nAlong railway tracks, also, the ballast forms a very hot, a very dry,\r\nand a very barren soil. Many of the regular railway-track plants are\r\nforeigners from the far south, even from the sunny shores of the\r\nMediterranean. They are mostly annuals, such as the little Toadflax\r\n(_Linaria minor_), which can just manage to exist under those\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nOf course, the sides of the banks and of cuttings on railways are\r\ngenerally formed of good earth or soil, and support a rich and\r\nflourishing flora of true Britons.\r\n\r\nBesides these slow, laborious lichens, mosses, and others which\r\nattack rock, there are other plants which are generally called rock\r\nplants, though they behave quite differently.\r\n\r\nThese are those fine hardy Hawkweeds, Roseroots, Sempervivums, Mew,\r\nand others which establish their roots in cracks or crevices of the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nSuch cracks are soon full of good soil, for the wind blows decayed\r\nleaves and dust into them, and the roots are always burrowing into,\r\neating into, and shattering the rocks. Most of them have a circle of\r\nleaves which are pressed flat to the ground. Thus they escape the\r\nviolent winds and storms always common on such crags and precipices.\r\nThe flowers, however, supported on tough, strong, and flexible\r\nstalks, sway freely to and fro in the wind, and can be seen by\r\ninsects a long way off.\r\n\r\nThese rock plants are of some importance as stonebreakers and\r\npioneers in a very interesting process.\r\n\r\nWherever a cliff or precipice of stone is exposed, it is \"weathered.\"\r\nWater gets into the cracks and freezes in winter. But when water is\r\nfrozen it expands or widens, and as this happens to the water in the\r\ncrevices and cracks of rocks, pieces of rock are shivered and broken\r\noff. Besides frost and wind and rain, these rock plants help to\r\nattack the cliff. Their roots get into the crevices, and there widen\r\nand expand, tearing off great slabs and splinters of rock which fall\r\ndown to the foot of the cliff.\r\n\r\nDown below plants are every year growing over and covering up or\r\n\"happing up\" with green these bare fragments and splinters. A\r\nconsiderable amount falls down every year, so that the ground is\r\nalways being raised up below the precipice. At the brow or edge above\r\nthe precipice, there is also always a loss of rock and stone every\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nSo that every year the bare rock exposed becomes smaller and smaller,\r\nuntil eventually a steep, green, grass-covered slope covers over the\r\nentire site of that precipice.\r\n\r\nMoreover that is not by any means all that plants do in the way of\r\nchanging the scenery of the country. Look at the outlines of the\r\nhills in any part of Great Britain except in the broken, jagged,\r\nrocky mountain ranges of Scotland and Wales (also Cumberland,\r\nWestmorland, parts of Derbyshire and Dartmoor tors). Everywhere there\r\nare smooth, flowing, gently undulating rises and falls. No sharp,\r\nabrupt descents break these graceful sweeping curves. If you compare\r\nthe scenery of a cañon in the rainless deserts of Western America,\r\nthe contrast is very striking. There the sides of the valleys are\r\nsteep cliffs; it is all harsh, precipitous, horrible country, which\r\nis obviously very unpleasant and very unattractive to civilized\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIt is this green covering of plants which makes the difference.\r\nThe rain that falls is not allowed to cut out ragged ravines; it\r\nis intercepted and soaks into the grasses, which so keep a smooth,\r\ngentle outline over hill and valley.\r\n\r\nIf you notice the effect of a heavy shower of rain on a road or\r\nbare earth, you will see how soon tiny valleys and cañons and beds\r\nof streamlets are cut out. But on the green fields beside the road,\r\nthere is no change in the surface at all! It seems to be quite\r\nunaffected by the heaviest storm of rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nON VEGETABLE DEMONS\r\n\r\n   Animals and grass--Travellers in the elephant grass--Enemies\r\n   in Britain--Cactus _versus_ rats and wild asses--Angora\r\n   kids _v._ acacia--The Wait-a-bit thorn--Palm roots and\r\n   snails--Wild yam _v._ pig--Larch _v._ goat--Portuguese and\r\n   English gorse--Hawthorn _v._ rabbits--Briers, brambles,\r\n   and barberry--The bramble loop and sick children or ailing\r\n   cows--Briers of the wilderness--Theophrastus and Phrygian\r\n   goats--Carline near the Pyramids--Calthrops--Tragacanth--Hollies\r\n   and their ingenious contrivances--How thorns and spines are\r\n   formed--Tastes of animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy far the greater number of wild animals live by eating vegetables.\r\nIf one thinks of the elephant's trunk, the teeth of a hippopotamus,\r\nor even of the jaws and lips of mice, rats, and voles, the thoroughly\r\npractical character and efficiency of their weapons become the more\r\nastonishing the more one reflects upon them.\r\n\r\nYet the defences adopted by plants are just as wonderful, and are\r\noften most ingenious.\r\n\r\nIt seems at first remarkable that the most usual food of animals,\r\ngrass, should be apparently unprotected. It is upon grass that the\r\ngreat herds of bison, of buffalo, of antelope, and guanaco, are or\r\nwere supported. Yet grass is so wonderfully reproductive, produces\r\nsuch enormous quantities of buds and foliage, and grows in such\r\nluxuriance, that there is no fear of its being killed out.\r\n\r\nThere are many places in the world where vegetation defies the\r\nattacks of the animal world. Neither man nor elephant can live\r\ncomfortably in the thick jungles of West Africa and the great forests\r\nof Brazil. Nor can either man or elephant utilize great tracts of\r\ncountry in Central Africa which are covered by the Elephant Grass.\r\n\r\nFor, perhaps, four or five hours the weary caravan plods on through a\r\nsort of burrow, two feet wide, made in this gigantic grass. The stems\r\nare ten feet or more in height, and nearly meet overhead. There is\r\nnothing whatever to be seen except the narrow path. The atmosphere is\r\nstifling and hot. To cut a new road a few hundred yards long through\r\nit involves hours of labour. It is only when there has been a long\r\ndrought that it is possible to set fire to the Elephant Grass, and\r\nthen for a very short time the young growing shoots can be grazed.\r\nBut no cattle can break through when it is fully grown.\r\n\r\nThe very exuberance of vegetation in such cases prevents any harm.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is best to show how, even in Great Britain, all plants\r\nhave many dangerous foes. The roots of trees are nibbled by mice,\r\nvoles, and sometimes by swine. The bark is injured by cattle,\r\nroedeer, reddeer, fallowdeer, who tear the bark with their horns,\r\nand especially by rabbits and hares. The leaves are eaten by the\r\nsame animals and also by horses, goats, sheep, etc. The young buds\r\nare attacked by squirrels, who also break off the leading shoots of\r\ncertain firs when they happen to be in a playful mood.\r\n\r\nBut it is in cultivated lands and in open, rather dry and arid\r\ncountry that one finds the most interesting weapons in the fights\r\nbetween plant and animal. It is in such places that some of the most\r\nbeautiful and useful creatures have their home. The horse, ass,\r\ncamel, goat, and sheep probably belong to those wonderful lands\r\nwhich border the great deserts of Africa and Asia. These animals have\r\nbeen obliged to travel far and fast, and to perfect their bodily\r\nstrength in order to pick up a living.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & Underwood_\r\n  _London and New York_\r\n\r\n  CULTIVATED BAMBOO IN A CHINESE PLANTATION\r\n\r\n  These giant grasses are sometimes one hundred and twenty feet\r\n  high and one foot in diameter. They at times grow at the rate of\r\n  three feet per day, and are used for all sorts of purposes, such\r\n  as scaffolding poles, flower-pots, as a vegetable, etc. etc.]\r\n\r\nThey have been taught (perhaps we should say learnt) by the thorns\r\nand briers of the wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe Cactus, Prickly Pears, or other succulent plants which belong\r\nto true deserts, are covered over with most curious and interesting\r\nspines. A row of little projections runs down each edge of the\r\nround fleshy stem. On each projection there is a rosette of spines.\r\nSometimes these are long, slender, and diverging; in other cases they\r\nare short, stout, and curving over.\r\n\r\nNow imagine a guanaco in South America, or even a rat or mouse, which\r\nis perishing of thirst in the arid desert where such things are\r\nfound. It will be seen that it is by no means easy for it to taste\r\nthe water in the juicy stem, for even the thin muzzle of a rat could\r\nscarcely get between the thorns.\r\n\r\nKerner describes how the wild asses in South America root up or try\r\nto split the Cacti with their hoofs to get at the juicy tissue of the\r\nunarmed lower parts. Yet they often receive dangerous wounds in doing\r\nso from the frightful spines of Melocactus[80] and others.\r\n\r\n  [80] Kerner, _l.c._, vol. I, p. 447.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to see a flock of Angora goats in South Africa\r\nattacking an Acacia. The kid is a pretty, white, fluffy little\r\ncreature, with the most meek, mild, and innocent expression. Yet it\r\nis a quarrelsome little brute. In a few minutes an Acacia will be\r\ndespoiled, broken, and robbed of its foliage by a flock of them,\r\nalthough it bristles all over with long spines, of which there are a\r\npair at the base of each leaf.\r\n\r\nEven the _Kameeldorn_, Camelthorn Acacia, or the Wait-a-bit in South\r\nAfrica cannot defend itself.\r\n\r\nThe Wait-a-bit (_Wacht een beetje_) is so called from the ingenious\r\nnature of its spines. There are two together, of which one is\r\nstraight and the other curved round like a hook. Both are very sharp\r\nand strong, so that an incautious traveller is sure to injure himself\r\nand his clothes. The straight one runs into his tender flesh, whilst\r\nthe curved one fixes itself in his clothes.\r\n\r\nIt is by thorns, spines, and prickles that plants often protect\r\nthemselves against the attacks of grazing animals. But it must be\r\nremembered that these are by no means the only safeguard. Plants\r\nproduce poisonous, bitter, or strong-smelling substances which keep\r\noff their enemies, and these indeed often afford a more efficient\r\nprotection (see Chap. III.). These thorns, etc., can be produced in\r\nthe most unexpected places. There is one rule, however, namely that\r\nthey are invariably found in the exact spot where they can be most\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nThus there are certain palms which possess green, juicy leaves,\r\nmuch relished by snails. These are protected by a sort of spine\r\nentanglement formed upon certain roots, which grow at the base of\r\nthe leaves. Nor is this the only case in which spines are found on\r\nroots. There are certain South African bulbs (_Moræa_) which are\r\nprotected from the wild pigs by a dense mass of spiny roots.[81] On\r\nmy march to Uganda from Mombasa, I was very much astonished to see an\r\nextraordinary Wild Yam. It had a huge underground tuberous part full\r\nof starchy matter, but it was quite impossible for any marauding wild\r\nboar to get at it, for it was entirely enclosed in a sort of arbour\r\nof long, arching roots densely covered by stout spines, which made a\r\nperfect protection.[82]\r\n\r\n  [81] Scott, _Annals of Botany_, vol. 11, p. 327.\r\n\r\n  [82] Scott Elliot, _Naturalist in Mid Africa_.\r\n\r\nIt is more usual to find thorns developed on the branches or stems.\r\nGenerally these are formed on the outside towards the end of the\r\nbranches. In the Alps, larches have to suffer from the attacks of\r\ngoats which nibble off the ends of the young shoots. The part behind\r\nthe scar dries up, but fresh twigs are put out from further back\r\nalong the branch, until the tree becomes a closely branched, twiggy,\r\nbristling mass which looks like the clipped yews in old gardens. But\r\nso soon as it has grown tall enough to be above the reach of the\r\ngoats, an ordinary larch stem develops and may grow into quite a\r\nrespectable tree. This fact is given by Kerner von Marilaun (_l.c._,\r\np. 445), and is very instructive, as explaining why it is that so\r\noften the ends of the branches become hard thorns: the green leaves\r\nand twigs are hidden and protected.\r\n\r\nOne of the neatest examples of this is the Portuguese Gorse or Whin,\r\nwhich resembles a little cushion with every branch ending in strong\r\nthorns and every leaf terminated by a stout spine.\r\n\r\nThe common Whin, Furze, or Gorse, is very nearly as perfect an\r\nexample of thorniness and spininess. The Southdown sheep do not seem\r\nto injure it on those beautiful Sussex downs so famous for succulent\r\nmutton, yet in the early spring, or in a very wet season, one often\r\nfinds in the grass at the foot of the bush (or even in the bush\r\nitself) small shoots which would be taken at first sight as belonging\r\nto some other plant. These little shoots are grey with hairs and have\r\nsoft trefoil leaves which are quite unprotected, for their spines are\r\nquite soft. They are probably seldom eaten, for most of them are in\r\nthe shelter of the old spiny bushes.\r\n\r\nYet even the old bushes can be used as fodder for sheep if they are\r\ncrushed and ground up so as to break the thorns and spines. The Gorse\r\nis a very hardy plant, and is said to be only out of flower \"when\r\nkissing is out of fashion\" (see p. 100).\r\n\r\nThere is still some uncertainty as to the exact way in which animals\r\nset to work when they are eating thorny or spiny bushes. This makes\r\nthe arrangement of the thorns sometimes a little difficult to follow.\r\nMoreover it is often not so much the leaves as the juicy bark in\r\nwinter and early spring that is required. Sometimes everything above\r\nground is eaten down.\r\n\r\nRabbits, for instance, do not as a rule touch the Hawthorn, yet Mr.\r\nHamilton says, \"The second winter after planting was very severe and\r\nthis hedge was eaten down to the very ground by rabbits. For about\r\n600 yards I do not think that a single plant was missed.\"[83] In\r\nfrost and snow almost every plant is attacked by rabbits, and indeed\r\nby any grazing animal.\r\n\r\n  [83] Mr. Thomas Hamilton, _Researches by Lanarkshire Teachers_,\r\n  1902-3.\r\n\r\nRemembering that it is very often the young juicy shoots that are\r\nsought after, it is quite easy to see why the young Rose suckers and\r\nshoots from the base of the stem fairly bristle with long and short\r\nprickles. These latter are generally straight, not curved like those\r\nof the long arching branches which are supposed to hook themselves\r\non the branches of the surrounding trees. The young light-coloured\r\nbranches of the cultivated Gooseberry are flexible, and hang over in\r\nsuch a way as to make it difficult for an animal to reach the bark: a\r\ncow or sheep, if it wished to eat these branches, would begin at the\r\nhanging tip and make a sort of upward tearing jerk while its tongue\r\ngathered the branch into its mouth. If one copies this with the hand\r\nit is easy to see how the length and arrangement of the prickles and\r\nthe flexible nature of the spray would make such a proceeding on the\r\ncow's part most uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nSo also in the Barberry, the young juicy upright shoots which spring\r\nfrom the older branches have stout three to seven-branched prongs\r\npointing downwards, of the most efficient character. Each is really\r\na modified leaf and is found below each bud. Even the mere idea of\r\nan animal's tender lips or tongue tearing at these shoots from below\r\ngives one a momentary shudder. In the younger, wavy branches of the\r\nBarberry the spines are straighter or more diverging. The young\r\nleaves of the short bud above alluded to are also most efficiently\r\nprotected by their spines. The Hawthorn has a curious arrangement of\r\nvery long stout thorns, behind which the leaves are sheltered. The\r\nyounger flexible branches have smaller spines, which become efficient\r\nin winter and tend to prevent animals from eating the bark. The\r\nCockspur thorns are 4 to 5-1/2 inches long, and extremely like the\r\nspur of a gamecock.\r\n\r\nBramble prickles are generally curved back in order to hook or cling\r\nto the branches of other trees, but any one who has tried to force\r\nhis way through a clump of brambles knows the difficulty of doing so.\r\nThe loops made by the branches fixing themselves in the ground (see\r\np. 93) were at one time given credit for healing various diseases.\r\nChildren in Gloucestershire used to be dragged backwards and forwards\r\nunder these loops; in Cornwall also people afflicted with boils were\r\nmade to crawl under them. Even cows when suffering from paralysis\r\n(supposed to be due to a shrew-mouse walking over them) were dragged\r\nthrough the Bramble-loop, in which case Professor Buckman remarks,\r\n\"If the creature could wait the time of finding a loop large enough\r\nand suffer the dragging process at the end, we should say the case\r\nwould not be so hopeless as that of our friend's fat pig, who, when\r\nshe was ailing, had a mind to kill her to make sure on her.\"[84] The\r\nbrambles and briers of Gilead and Ezekiel were probably brambles of\r\nwhich _Rubus discolor_ is common in Palestine,[85] and the Butcher's\r\nBroom (_Ruscus aculeatus_). This last plant is really of the Lily\r\nfamily, and its flat leaf-like branches end in a sharp spine. The\r\nrabbit does not eat it.[86]\r\n\r\n  [84] Lindley's _Treasury of Botany_.\r\n\r\n  [85] Ridley, _Pharmac. Journ._, May 19, 1900.\r\n\r\n  [86] Maxwell, _Memories of the Months_, First Series, 1, pp.\r\n  74-76.\r\n\r\nAmongst foreign thorny and spiny plants it is very difficult to make\r\na selection.\r\n\r\nTheophrastus (one of the very earliest botanists--see p. 37)\r\ndescribes a class of shrub very common in Phrygia, in which the\r\nleaves are produced at the base of the young shoots, which latter end\r\nat the top in branch thorns. These thorns, therefore, entirely cover\r\nthe foliage and keep off that vegetable demon the goat. Some of the\r\nCrucifers, Roses, Composites, Labiates, etc., take on this habit in\r\ngoat-infested countries.[87]\r\n\r\n  [87] Kerner, _l.c._\r\n\r\nIn Egypt, near the Pyramids, one often finds _Carlina acaulis_, a\r\nlittle thistle which has no stem, but is merely a flower seated in\r\nthe middle of a rosette of leaves which lie flat on the sand. In the\r\ncentre there is a circle of sharp spines, each of which is from one\r\nto two inches in length. The nostril of a hungry camel or donkey is\r\nsure to be pierced if it tries to eat the leaves. The spines of this\r\nthistle, like those of our Carline and the _Centaurea calcitrapa_\r\n(thistle of the Bible), spring from the bracts surrounding the\r\nflower.\r\n\r\nThe ancient \"calthrops\" or \"crawtaes\" (first used by the Romans) were\r\ndesigned from the spines of the last-named plant[88] (_calx_, heel,\r\nand _trappa_, snare.) It had four iron spines, so that, however it\r\nwas thrown down on the ground or in a ford, a spine was sure to stick\r\nup and to lame man or horse.\r\n\r\n  [88] Ridley _l.c._\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: 1. Old Roman Calthrops, left on roads, fords,\r\n  etc., to lame horses.\r\n\r\n  2, 3. Fruits of Tribulus, showing efficient spines. Animals'\r\n  feet, in passing, must catch them. They are more efficient than\r\n  Calthrops.]\r\n\r\nThe Tragacanth plant has also very neat spines. They are the\r\npersistent spiny stalks or midribs of the older leaves from which\r\nthe leaflets have dropped away. The fresh green leaflets are quite\r\nprotected inside these withered spines.\r\n\r\nSeveral grasses have leaves which end in sharp or needlelike points.\r\nOne of these, _Festuca alpestris_, actually produces bleeding at the\r\nnostrils of grazing cattle, and is detested by all the shepherds of\r\nthe Alps.\r\n\r\nThe Holly is one of our most beautiful trees, as John Evelyn points\r\nout: \"This _vulgar_ but _incomparable_ tree.... Is there under\r\n_Heaven_ a more glorious and refreshing object of the kind than\r\nan impregnable _hedge_ of near _three hundred_ feet in _length_,\r\n_nine_ foot _high_ and _five_ in _diameter_: which I can show in my\r\npoor _Gardens_ at any time in the year, glittering with its arm'd\r\nand vernished _leaves_? The taller _Standards_ at orderly distances\r\nblushing with their natural _Coral_.\"[89] This apparently was the\r\nidentical hedge into which Peter the Great used to trundle his\r\nwheelbarrows. The barrows contained his courtiers. There was a nice\r\nrun from the top of rising ground close at hand. It was at Sales\r\nCourt, Deptford.\r\n\r\n  [89] Evelyn, _Silva_.\r\n\r\nThe spiny leaves of the Holly are unfortunately not nearly strong\r\nenough to save it from its enemies. The bark is apparently of a\r\nparticularly delicious and toothsome nature, for sheep, cattle, and\r\nthe ubiquitous rabbit are always delighted to destroy the trees.\r\n\r\nIt has been noticed that wild hollies have at the base very spiny\r\nleaves, but that higher up on the tree (above the reach of cattle)\r\nthe leaves have no spines at all. Sir Herbert Maxwell, in his\r\n_Memories of the Months_,[90] takes up this question. It is best to\r\ngive the description in his own words:--\r\n\r\n  [90] Third Series, p. 60.\r\n\r\n\"I strolled out along the banks of Tay in that noble woodland which\r\nis continuous from Dunkeld to Murthly. Here there are many fine\r\nhollies, some on the river banks and cliffs, others on level ground,\r\nplanted by no hand of man. There was not one of these which did\r\nnot confirm my observations first made many years ago, and hardly\r\none which did not bear evidence of special growth--not merely as a\r\nreaction against pruning or cropping, but _as a precaution_ _against\r\nany such contingency_--so regular and deliberate as to suggest that\r\nthese trees are something more than unconscious automata.\r\n\r\n\"Many of these hollies are thirty feet high, with foliage down to\r\nthe ground. They carry spinous leaves up to a height of three or\r\nfour feet; above that level all the foliage is absolutely smooth\r\nand spineless. One tree rose from the ground in two bare stems, and\r\nthe lower branches did not reach below the browsing level. But from\r\nbetween the two old stems rose a young shoot about four feet long,\r\nclothed throughout its entire length with intensely prickly leaves.\r\nThis tree was growing in an enclosed wood where cattle could not\r\ncome; still, roedeer might be about, and the holly armed its young\r\ngrowth at the low level, although the leaders of the old stems, not\r\nless vigorous in growth, bore leaves as smooth as a camellia's. I\r\nnoted one particularly suggestive tree, an unhealthy one. The growth\r\nhad died back along most of the branches, which stood out bare and\r\ndry; but a recuperative effort was in progress; fresh and luxuriant\r\ngrowth was bursting along nearly the whole height of the stem, and\r\nthe foliage of this was vigorously prickly up to about four feet,\r\nand smooth above that height. I noticed many instances of localised\r\nprickly growth where boughs, originally above the browsing level,\r\nand clothed with spineless leaves, had been weighed down and cropped\r\nby cattle. But this is merely a vigorous reaction against external\r\ninjury, such as makes a clipped holly hedge bear spinous foliage from\r\nbase to summit.\"[91]\r\n\r\n  [91] _Memories of the Months_, Third Series, p. 366.\r\n\r\nThis quotation shows that there is no doubt as to the facts. It is\r\ntrue that one finds cultivated hollies showing many variations.\r\nSometimes all the leaves are spiny, both above and below. In other\r\nvarieties none of the leaves possess spines at all. Yet it must be\r\nadmitted that these are facts and cannot be denied.[92]\r\n\r\n  [92] I had expressed some doubt in my _Nature Studies: Plant\r\n  Life_.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Osmanthus, with its holly-like leaves, the Evergreen\r\nOak, and some Junipers are found to show exactly the same curious\r\ndifference. The perilously-situated lower leaves are more spiny than\r\nthose which are above the reach of grazing animals.\r\n\r\nKerner von Marilaun[93] also has remarked a similar protective\r\narrangement in _Gleditschia chinensis_ and in the Wild Pear. Trees\r\nof the latter, when they are young, \"bristle with the spines into\r\nwhich the ends of the woody branches are transformed\"; but tall trees\r\ntwelve to fifteen feet high are entirely without thorns!\r\n\r\n  [93] _l.c._, vol. I, p. 433.\r\n\r\nIt is when one meets coincidences of this nature that the full\r\nmeaning of plant life begins to dawn upon the mind.\r\n\r\nHow is it that the plant knows the time to produce its spines, and\r\nthe time to refrain from doing so?\r\n\r\nThere are certain queer facts that have been given on good authority\r\nas to the causes which tend to produce thorniness and spininess.\r\n\r\nLinnæus, _Philos. Bot._, p. 215, § 272, says:--\r\n\r\n\"Spinosae arbores cultura saepius deponunt spinas in hortis.\"\r\nLothelier found that Barberries grown in a moist atmosphere had no\r\nspiny leaves, and that the thorns were far less woody under those\r\nconditions, whilst in a perfectly arid and dry atmosphere only spines\r\nwere formed; a strong light also tended to produce spines.\r\n\r\nProfessor Sickenberger grew a desert plant (_Zilla myagroides_) in\r\nthe Botanic Garden at Cairo, and found that its spines were much\r\nweaker and more slender than the strong rigid thorns which cover it\r\nin its natural desert.\r\n\r\nProfessor Henslow[94] found that the spiny form of the Rest Harrow,\r\nwhen grown in a rich soil with an abundance of water, gradually loses\r\nits spines. All these experiments certainly show that a dry desert\r\nsort of life, and possibly strong sunlight, favour the development of\r\nspines and thorns.\r\n\r\n  [94] _Origin of Plant Structures_, pp. 38-40.\r\n\r\nOf this there cannot be any reasonable doubt, for the extraordinary\r\nquantity of thorny, spiny things in deserts shows that there must be\r\nsome connexion between such a life and their production (see Chapter\r\nX.). In such places animals are always abundant. But these hollies,\r\npears, and other plants show exactly the opposite to what we should\r\nexpect. It is when the head of the young holly reaches the sunlight\r\nand feels the wind that its leaves become harmless!\r\n\r\nIf one remembers the case of the young larch and its goat enemies on\r\npage 181, it is perhaps possible to think that the lower branches\r\nand twigs were for untold generations exposed to laceration and\r\nbiting. Thus, suffering from the loss of water by these regular\r\nannual wounds, the leaves developed their spines in response. So far,\r\nbelief is not more difficult than it is with regard to the origin\r\nof any variety. But whenever, by reversion to their ancestral type,\r\nthe original not-spiny leaves developed on the top of a tree, that\r\ntree would have an advantage, for every leaf on it would be more\r\neconomically produced; a smooth leaf would not require to spend food\r\nin order to make spines. Such trees, spiny below and smooth above,\r\nwould be best fitted to survive, healthier and more vigorous, and in\r\nthe end would leave more descendants.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, such a case as this reveals again that mysterious\r\nand exquisite purposefulness which a reverent mind discovers in\r\nNature everywhere.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, as we have already pointed out, we are exceedingly\r\nignorant of many of the very commonest facts. Léo Errera, the great\r\nBelgian botanist (whose recent death has been a terrible loss to\r\nscience), collected together some facts as to the taste of cattle for\r\nvarious spiny and thorny plants; he found that cattle wished to eat\r\nthe following: Buckthorn, whin or gorse, raspberry, brambles, the\r\nScotch thistle, the creeping thistle, as well as musk, welted and\r\nslender thistles, sow thistle, and saltwort.\r\n\r\nThey avoided: Barberry, the petty and German whin, rest harrow, the\r\ncarline, and the other thistles not given above, as well as the\r\ncommon juniper.\r\n\r\nThey disdained or despised: Sea holly, common holly, milk thistle,\r\n_Lactuca_, and _Urtica urens_.[95]\r\n\r\n  [95] Errera, _Un Ordre de Recherches trop négligé_. See also\r\n  Ludwig, _Biologie d. Pflanzen_, p. 210.\r\n\r\nSo far as the holly is concerned, it is certainly not despised\r\nby sheep and rabbits in this country. But how few are the plants\r\ninvestigated! Several of the commonest British plants are omitted\r\njust because no one has taken the trouble to watch them.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is an opportunity of discovering something new, fresh,\r\nand interesting which should be well within the reach of any one who\r\npasses his life in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nON NETTLES, SENSITIVE PLANTS, ETC.\r\n\r\n   Stinging nettles at home and abroad--The use of the nettle--Sham\r\n   nettles--Sensitive plants--Mechanism--Plants alive, under\r\n   chloroform and ether--Telegraph plant--Woodsorrel--Have plants\r\n   nerves?--Electricity in the Polar regions--Plants under electric\r\n   shocks--Currents of electricity in plants--The singing of trees\r\n   to the electro-magnetic ear--Experiments--Electrocution of\r\n   vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe common nettle is one of our most interesting British plants. It\r\nis exposed to great danger; one sees it growing not only in pastures\r\nand parks, but in waste places, along roadsides, and near cultivated\r\nground. Yet it is very seldom either eaten or even touched. Cattle do\r\noccasionally eat the young shoots. But this is exceptional, for even\r\nin fields where there are plenty of cattle great clumps of nettle\r\nluxuriate and increase in size every year.\r\n\r\nThe stinging hairs are hollow and shaped rather like a narrow bulb\r\nor flask; the tip is slightly bent over and rounded (not sharp);\r\nthe hairs contain formic acid. If one grasps the nettle or strokes\r\nit in a particular way (from below upwards) the hairs are pressed\r\nflat against the stem or broken, so that no wound is made by them in\r\nthe skin and consequently they do no harm. But if the point of the\r\nhair pierces the skin, the well-known irritation is set up. That is\r\nbecause formic acid is poured into the wound. Besides the stinging\r\nhairs which keep off all the larger animals (including man) there are\r\nothers, shorter and thickly set, which do not sting at all, but are\r\nintended to keep off snails.[96]\r\n\r\n  [96] _Gard. Chronicle_, 32, 390.\r\n\r\nThe pain produced by our common nettle is, however, a very trifling\r\nmatter compared with that produced by some of the foreign species.\r\nOne of the Indian kinds was used to excite and irritate bulls when\r\nthey were intended to fight with tigers in the games which used to\r\nbe held at some Indian Courts. Another found in Timor is called the\r\nDevil's Leaf; the effect of its sting may last for twelve months and\r\nmay even produce death. But a still more dangerous stinging plant\r\nis a handsome tree (_Laportea moroides_) found in Australia. It is\r\noften 120-140 feet high, and has fine dark-green leaves often one\r\nfoot in length. The sting is so powerful that even horses are killed\r\nby touching its leaves. The sting of _Jatropha urens_ is so strong\r\nthat people become unconscious. In Java also the sting of _Urtica\r\nstimulans_ continues to smart for twenty-four hours, and may produce\r\na fever which is very difficult to shake off.[97]\r\n\r\n  [97] Lindley, _l.c._; Ludwig, _l.c._\r\n\r\nYet our common nettle is the favourite food-plant of the caterpillars\r\nof the Small Tortoiseshell, Red Admiral, Peacock, Camberwell Beauty,\r\nand other butterflies.[98] These caterpillars are possibly more\r\nintelligent than many of our country folk, who do not know that the\r\nnettle is a very useful plant, as the following statements most\r\nclearly prove. Its young leaves make an excellent spinach, and it\r\nwas, according to Sir Walter Scott, formerly cultivated in Scotland\r\nas a pot-herb. Pigs, turkeys, geese, and fowls like the leaves when\r\nthey are chopped up. It is said that the dried leaves and seeds will\r\nmake hens lay in winter time. The seeds, under pressure, yield quite\r\na good oil. A yellow dye can be obtained by boiling the roots with\r\nalum. An excellent string can also be made from the inner bark of the\r\nstems, which has, in fact, been used to make twine and even clothing.\r\nThe nettle is also valuable as an external stimulant in cases of\r\nparalysis.\r\n\r\n  [98] _Memories of the Month_, First Series, p. 73.\r\n\r\nA plant with so many wonderful properties would not be so common as\r\nit is, or so little disturbed, if it were not for its powerful stings.\r\n\r\nThere are one or two plants which are extremely like the nettle\r\nat first sight. Lord Avebury has an illustration in his excellent\r\nlittle book[99] in which it is most difficult to tell which are White\r\nDeadnettles and which are stinging nettles. No doubt the harmless\r\ndeadnettle is helped to escape injury by this resemblance. The Hemp\r\nDeadnettle and some Campanulas are also very like it when growing.\r\nThese also are sham nettles and may escape in the same way.\r\n\r\n  [99] _Flowers, Fruit, and Leaves._\r\n\r\nThere are several common greenhouse Primulas which also produce\r\nirritation of the skin. When handled by gardeners a painful smart is\r\nset up which lasts for some time. _Primula obconica_ is the worst\r\nof these, but _P. sinensis_, _P. cortusoides_, and _P. Sieboldii_\r\nsometimes have the same effect. In all these cases it is due to a\r\npeculiar secretion of certain glandular hairs.[100]\r\n\r\n  [100] Nestler, _Sitz. d. K. Akad. d. Wiss. Wien_, vol. 3, p. 27.\r\n\r\nThe methods of protection against grazing animals so far described,\r\nsuch as stinging hairs, thorns, spines, etc. (see page 190), are\r\nobvious enough, but perhaps the most ingenious system of defence is\r\nthat exhibited by the Sensitive Plant and a few others.\r\n\r\nWhen man or any heavy animal is approaching certain Indian plants,\r\ntheir leaves suddenly drop, and the leaflets close together. The mere\r\nshaking of the ground or of the air produces these extraordinary\r\nmovements in the sensitive Woodsorrel (_Oxalis sensitiva_), in two\r\nLeguminous plants (_Smithia sensitiva_ and _Aeschynomene indica_),\r\nand in several Mimosas.\r\n\r\nWhen one leaf-tip of _Mimosa pudica_, the Sensitive Plant (_par\r\nexcellence_), is touched or injured, a series of changes begin. All\r\nthe little leaflets shut up one after the other; then the secondary\r\nstalks drop; after this the main stalk of the leaf suddenly droops\r\ndownwards. After a short interval, the next leaf above goes through\r\nidentically the same movements. If the shaking or injury is severe,\r\nevery leaf from below upwards moves in the same way.\r\n\r\nOne probable advantage of these movements can be understood from the\r\nbehaviour of flies, which alight upon the leaves and make them drop.\r\nThe flies are startled and go away. Grazing animals will consider\r\nsuch behaviour in a vegetable as very uncanny, and will probably go\r\nto some other less ingeniously protected plant.\r\n\r\nOf course such extraordinary behaviour has been a challenge to the\r\nbotanical world, and there is an overwhelming mass of speculation,\r\nand observations about the Sensitive Plant.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved that the movements are caused by the thickened\r\npart at the base of the main stalk of the leaf. This is swollen, and\r\nfull of water, and much thicker than the stalk itself. It is by this\r\nthickened portion that the leaf is kept at its proper angle. When the\r\ntip of the leaf is shaken or injured, the cells on the under side of\r\nthis swollen part allow their water to exude into the spaces between\r\nthem, and in consequence down comes the leaf-stalk.\r\n\r\nThis is not, by any means, a full or even a sufficient explanation.\r\nThere is certainly some peculiar sending of messages from the tip of\r\nthe leaf to the swollen part itself. It is not safe to say that it is\r\na nerve message, but the process resembles the way in which messages\r\nare sent by the nerves in animals. Not only so, but the contraction\r\nof the under side and a corresponding expansion on the upper side,\r\nresembles the muscular movements of contraction and expansion in\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nIt must always be remembered that plants are alive; their living\r\nmatter is not in any way (so far as we know) essentially different\r\nfrom that of animals or of man. Their living matter (protoplasm) in\r\nleaf-stalks and leaves is cut up into boxes or cells, each enclosed\r\nin a case or wall of its own. Yet these are not entirely independent\r\nand unconnected, for thin living threads run from cell to cell, so\r\nthat there is an uninterrupted chain of protoplasm all along the\r\nleaf, leaf-stalk, and stem.\r\n\r\nIn this particular case of the Sensitive Plant, the leaves at night\r\nregularly take up the position which they adopt when injured or\r\nshaken during the daytime.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to produce the shrinking of the leaves is, as has\r\nbeen mentioned, to hold a lighted match a little below the leaf-tip.\r\nSevere shaking, a strong electric shock, or a railway journey will\r\nalso produce closing of the leaves.\r\n\r\nUnder chloroform or ether, or if the atmospheric pressure is suddenly\r\ndiminished, the leaves will also fall. In some respects they are very\r\nlifelike, for if too often stimulated they become \"fatigued,\" and\r\nwill not react unless a sufficient interval of rest is allowed them.\r\n\r\nThe reaction occurs very soon if the plant is in good condition: in\r\nless than one second it begins, and the leaf-stalk may fall in two\r\nto five seconds, but the recovery is very slow.\r\n\r\nVivisection is a cruel sort of proceeding, although it may sometimes\r\nbe necessary. The most curious vivisections have been performed on\r\nMimosa. When the leaflets are cut off, it is possible, on a stimulus\r\nbeing applied, to see water oozing out of the cut surface of the\r\nstalk. This would go to show that it is the water being discharged\r\nfrom the leaf-base that produces the movement.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, many points in the behaviour of the Sensitive\r\nPlant which have not yet been explained.\r\n\r\nPossibly the curious Semaphore or Telegraph Plants, whose leaflets\r\nsuddenly and without any obvious reason move with a jerk through an\r\nangle of several degrees, may also be protected from animals by this\r\nuncanny and unusual behaviour.\r\n\r\nBut though the Sensitive Plant is certainly protected from grazing\r\nanimals by these movements, other advantages may be derived. Heavy\r\nrain, for instance, such as occurs in the tropics, will not injure\r\nits delicate leaves. Dust-storms will not damage it, and at night\r\nthere will be no loss of heat by radiation. The \"shrunk\" or folded\r\ncondition of the leaflets will decrease any chance of injury by\r\nraindrops, for the rain will not fall on the broad surface of the\r\nleaflets. A nearly vertical leaf also will not suffer the loss of\r\nheat which a horizontal one would endure.\r\n\r\nBesides the plants mentioned above, there are several others in which\r\nby a rather severe shaking the leaves can be made to fold up. This is\r\nthe case with the common Woodsorrel (_Oxalis acetosella_), with the\r\nFalse Acacia (_Robinia_), and a few others.\r\n\r\nThe former has a peculiarly delicate leaf. In cold, wet weather its\r\nleaflets hang limp and numb from the leaf-stalk all day. In fine\r\nweather they are spread out horizontally. On a fine sunny afternoon\r\nits leaflets may sometimes take a mid-day sleep, for they hang\r\nloosely down in the same way that they do in cold, wet weather or at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nBut in the Woodsorrel these movements are not for protection against\r\ngrazing animals.\r\n\r\nThere are other examples amongst plants of a distinct sudden movement\r\nwhich begins whenever part of the plant is touched. The movements of\r\ntendrils have been already referred to. The Venus' Fly Trap and the\r\nSundew will be mentioned when we are discussing Insectivorous Plants.\r\nThere are also several flowers in which the stamens suddenly spring\r\nup when they are touched by an insect (Barberry, Centaurea, and\r\nSparmannia), and in Mimulus the style-flaps close when touched (see\r\np. 70).\r\n\r\nAll these cases seem to involve some sort of mechanism which replaces\r\nthe nervous system of animals.\r\n\r\nNo very definite laws have yet been discovered as to the way in which\r\nplants are affected by electricity, but enough is known to show that\r\nthere are many interesting discoveries in prospect.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lemström has made some interesting experiments in the Polar\r\nregions which go to show that the rich development of plant life in\r\nthat desolate region may be connected with the peculiar electrical\r\nconditions of the Polar atmosphere; the aurora borealis, which is a\r\ncommon phenomenon there, being also produced by those conditions.\r\n\r\nSeveral writers have claimed that slight electric shocks given at\r\nfrequent intervals help the growth of plants and especially quicken\r\nthe germination of seeds, but it can scarcely be said that this has\r\nbeen proved.\r\n\r\nWhen a branch or leaf-stalk is wounded or injured by being\r\ntightly clamped in a vice, then it will be found that a current\r\nof electricity passes from the injured spot to the part that is\r\nuntouched, and then in the reverse direction.\r\n\r\nChanges of current are also produced when a leaf is suddenly exposed\r\nto light for a short time and then shaded.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting observations is that made by Major\r\nSquiers near Lorin Station, in America, where the California Gas\r\nand Electric Corporation of San Francisco has a long-distance\r\ntransmission telegraph line. The power is transmitted at a voltage\r\nof 56,000 with a frequency of sixty cycles per second (three-phase).\r\nMajor Squiers, from previous experiments, thought that a note\r\ncorresponding to this frequency might be heard in a telephone\r\nreceiver. The following was the result:--\r\n\r\n\"Upon connecting the telephone between two nails driven in any\r\ngrowing tree along the route of the line, and at a reasonable\r\ndistance therefrom, the telephone responded to this note with great\r\nclearness, and when the distance was not more than 100 feet, the\r\nsound was very loud. For this experiment no microphone need be used,\r\nnor any source of electromotive force other than that induced in the\r\ntree itself, the telephone being connected directly between two nails\r\ndriven into the tree....\r\n\r\n\"Several kinds of trees of various sizes and forms were examined\r\nalong this power transmission line, and all were found to be singing\r\nwith a loud voice the fundamental note characteristic of the line\r\ncurrent. Indeed, the strip of vegetation along this line has thus\r\nbeen singing continuously, day and night, for several years, since\r\nthe operation of the line began; it needed only the electro-magnetic\r\near to make the sound apparent....\r\n\r\n\"The general appearance of vegetation along this route is certainly\r\nvigorous.\"[101]\r\n\r\n  [101] Squiers, \"On the Absorption of Electro-magnetic Waves by\r\n  Living Vegetable Organisms,\" December 3, 1904.\r\n\r\nAn interesting little experiment was carried out by the author in\r\nGlasgow, with the kind help of Professor Blyth, at the Glasgow and\r\nWest of Scotland Technical College. By attaching one wire to the\r\nupper part of the stem of a young pot-plant whilst the other wire\r\nwas inserted in the base of the stem, it was easy to show that an\r\nelectric current was passing--at any rate, during the daytime. In the\r\nevening, however, this was not at all distinct. That such currents do\r\noccur in living trees seems to be admitted. A similar current was not\r\nfound in a stick of dead-wood. The mere passage of the water through\r\nthe plant in transpiration might, however, cause such a current, for\r\nthe water is evaporated at the leaves.\r\n\r\nA strong electric shock may of course _electrocute_ a plant by\r\nkilling the cells. It is possible to cause the Mimosa leaves to close\r\nby means of an electric shock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nON FLOWERS OF THE WATER\r\n\r\n   The first plant--Seaweeds in hot baths--Breaking\r\n   of the meres--Gory Dew--Plants driven back to\r\n   the water--Marsh plants--Fleur-de-lis--Reeds and\r\n   rushes--Floating islands--Water-lilies--_Victoria\r\n   regia_--Plants 180 feet deep--Life in a pond, as seen by\r\n   an inhabitant--Fish-farming--The useful Diatom--Willows\r\n   and Alders--Polluted streams--The Hornwort--The Florida\r\n   Hyacinth--Reeds and Grass-reeds--The richest lands in the\r\n   world--Papyrus of Egypt--Birds and hippopotami--Fever and ague.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the first green plant? When was the surface of the earth\r\nfirst covered with flowers? Such questions are quite impossible\r\nto answer. We cannot even tell how plants ever came to exist on\r\nthe earth at all. Wonderful as are the stories of the hardihood of\r\nbacteria, of spores, and of seeds, it is not possible to imagine that\r\nthey could have been whirled or drifted through infinite space to\r\nthis particular planet.\r\n\r\nYet it is at least probable that the first real plant on this world\r\nwas a seaweed or alga.\r\n\r\nIn Germany and Austria there are certain springs in which the water\r\ncoming from immense depths is at an exceedingly high temperature.\r\nThese hot springs are used as natural hot baths, and have many\r\ninteresting peculiarities. Amongst others there is the fact that\r\ncertain seaweeds or algæ are found luxuriating in the hot water. Some\r\nof these can even live in springs with a temperature of 176° F.!\r\n\r\nSuch algæ may have remained living in exceedingly hot water ever\r\nsince that long distant time, the very first of all the geological\r\nperiods, when there was no distinct separation betwixt land and\r\nwater, and when the waters which were below the firmament had not\r\nbeen separated from those which were above it. Then the world seems\r\nto have been all fog and mist at a very high temperature.\r\n\r\nBut all theories on the origin of the world might be briefly\r\nsummarized by the last nine words!\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the first plant was almost certainly a seaweed or alga\r\nnot unlike those which produce the so-called \"breaking of the meres.\"\r\n\r\nAt some seasons the water of certain lakes, usually quite clear\r\nand pure, becomes discoloured, turbid, and everywhere crowded with\r\nmultitudes of tiny, bright, verdigris-green specks. The fish at\r\nonce begin to sulk, refuse to take the fly, and live torpid at\r\nthe bottom of the water. The minute green particles consist of a\r\ncertain seaweed or alga. Mr. Phillips put the head of a common pin\r\nin the water so as to obtain a very small drop. When placed under\r\na microscope, this minute amount of water was found to contain 300\r\nindividual algæ.[102] This was in Newton Mere (Shropshire), and as\r\nthis lake extends over 115 acres, it is possible to imagine the\r\nmillions upon millions of algæ which must have existed in it. The\r\nnames of these seaweeds are many thousand times longer than the algæ\r\nthemselves, and it is not really necessary to give them. One of\r\nthem, however, _Aphanizomenon flos-aquæ_, has been noticed \"tingeing\r\nwith its delicate green hue the margin of the smallest of the Lochs\r\nMaben, in Dumfriesshire.\"[103] Yet it is not so big as the dot on\r\nthe _i_ in its name. Many other cases have been recorded of lakes\r\nthat were coloured sometimes a \"pea-green,\" or even brown or red by\r\nsimilar tiny little seaweeds. As we shall see, the water of such\r\nlakes generally contains a very large amount of suspended or floating\r\nvegetable life.\r\n\r\n  [102] Cooke, _British Freshwater Algæ_, on the authority of\r\n  Phillips, _Trans. Shropshire Natural History Society_.\r\n\r\n  [103] Dickie, _Journal Bot. Soc. Edin._, vol. 3, p. 79.\r\n\r\nAnother curious appearance is _Gory Dew_. Patches of a deep blood-red\r\nor purple colour are found on the ground or on walls. They have just\r\nthe appearance of recently-shed blood. This also is due to an alga\r\n(_Porphyridium cruentum_). Dr. Cooke quotes from Drayton as follows:\r\n\"In the plain, near Hastings, where the Norman William, after his\r\nvictory found King Harold slain, he built Battle Abbey, which at\r\nlast, as divers other monasteries, grew to a town enough populous.\r\nThereabout is a place which, after rain, always looks red, which some\r\nhave attributed to a very bloody sweat of the earth, as crying to\r\nHeaven for vengeance of so great a slaughter.\"\r\n\r\nThe ordinary \"Rain of Blood\" which appears on _not too fresh_ meat,\r\nand looks like minute specks of red-currant jelly, is due to one of\r\nthe Bacteria (_Micrococcus prodigiosus_).\r\n\r\nThe original algæ or seaweeds probably had descendants which migrated\r\nto the land and eventually after many geological periods became\r\nour flowering plants and ferns. But the earth has become so richly\r\nsupplied with plants of all sorts and kinds that it is now by no\r\nmeans easy for any plant to find a roothold for its existence. So\r\nthat a considerable number have been forced back to the water, and\r\nhave accustomed themselves to live in or even under water in company\r\nwith their lowly cousins, the seaweeds, who remained below its\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThese water plants are very interesting. They are always competing\r\nwith one another. There is a perpetual struggle going on round every\r\npond and loch, and by every river side.\r\n\r\nIf you look carefully round the edge of a loch or pond which lies in\r\na grass field, certain series of plants are generally found to follow\r\none another in quite a definite way. The first sign of water in grass\r\nis generally the presence of moss or \"fog\" between the grass-stems\r\nand the appearance of what farmers call the \"Blue Carnation Grass.\"\r\nIt is not a grass but a sedge (_Carex glauca_ or _C. panicea_) with\r\nleaves rather like those of a carnation. A little nearer the border\r\nof the pond, there may be a tall coarse grass (_Aira caespitosa_\r\nor _Festuca elatior_). Next there is almost certain to be a fringe\r\nof Rushes. Where the Rushes begin to find the ground too wet for\r\nthem, all sorts of marsh plants flourish, such as Water Plantain,\r\nCuckoo-flower, the Spearwort Buttercup, Woundwort, and the like.\r\nAs soon as the actual water begins, one finds, whilst it is still\r\nshallow, the Flag series of yellow or purple Irises, Bogbeans, Marsh\r\nCinquefoil, Mare's Tail, and Sedges of various kinds. In this part\r\nthe water ranges from an inch or two to about eighteen inches deep.\r\n\r\nThe Flag or Iris is a very common and yet interesting plant. It\r\nhas a stout, fleshy stem lying flat on the mud, and anchored to\r\nit by hundreds of little roots. The flower is the original of the\r\nFleur-de-lis, or Lily of France, which took the fancy of the King of\r\nFrance as he rode through the marshes towards Paris. (It is true that\r\nthere are some unromantic authors who hold that the emblem was really\r\nintended to represent a frog or toad!)\r\n\r\nThe flower consists of three upright petals and three hollow sepals,\r\nwhich make so many canals leading down to the honey, and roofed over\r\nby an arched and coloured style. As the bee hurries down the canal\r\nto its nectar, its back is first brushed by a narrow lip-like stigma\r\nand then dusted with pollen. The leaves overlap in a curious way,\r\nand, when they have withered, their stringy remains serve to protect\r\nthe fleshy stem. _Orris root_, which is used in perfumery, is the\r\nstem of the _Iris florentina_.\r\n\r\nMost of the other plants in this Flag series will be found to\r\nhave prostrate main stems growing under the water, but giving off\r\nflowering and foliage stems which stand up above it, so that the\r\nleaves and flowers are above the surface.\r\n\r\nIn the next part of the pond, where the water is from eighteen inches\r\nto nine feet deep, masses of reeds will be found usually swaying,\r\nsighing, and whispering in the wind. There are many kinds, such as\r\nBulrushes, Phragmites, Horsetail, Scirpus, etc. It seems to be the\r\ndepth, the exposure to wind, the character of the soil, and other\r\nunknown factors, that determine which of those will be present. All\r\nof them are tall, standing well above the water; their main stem is\r\nusually flat on the bottom of the pond, or floating horizontally in\r\nthe water, but giving off many upright branches.\r\n\r\nFloating islands are often formed by some of these horizontal main\r\nstems breaking off and being carried away. Those Chinese who possess\r\nno land make floating islands of such reeds for themselves, and grow\r\ncrops on them. There are hundreds of such islands in the Canton River.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & Underwood_\r\n  _London and New York_\r\n\r\n  A LEAF RAFT\r\n\r\n  Victoria Regia, the giant water-lily of the Amazons. Those shown\r\n  are in a public park in Minnesota and are able to support the\r\n  weight of a child. In their native home the leaves are said to be\r\n  ten feet in diameter.]\r\n\r\nBeyond the reeds, one sees the large flat, floating leaves and\r\nbeautiful cup-like white or yellow flowers of the Water-lilies. They\r\ngrow in water which is not more than fifteen feet deep. Their long\r\nstalks and leaf-stalks are flexible and yield readily, so as to keep\r\nthe flowers and leaves floating. There are narrow submerged leaves\r\nas well. The actual stem of the White Water-lily is about three\r\ninches in diameter, and stout and fleshy. It is full of starchy\r\nmaterial, and lies upon the mud deep down at the bottom of the pond.\r\nThere are many advantages in the position of the flowers, for bees,\r\nflies, and other useful insects can reach them easily, but slugs,\r\nsnails, and other enemies cannot do so. The little seeds have a\r\ncurious lifebelt-like cup, which enables them to float on the surface.\r\n\r\nOf course, our own British water-lilies cannot compare with the\r\nmagnificent _Victoria regia_ of the tropics. Its petals are white\r\nor pink on the inside, and its gigantic leaves, six feet or more in\r\ndiameter, can support a retriever dog or a child. There used to be\r\nsome of them at Kew Gardens. A curious point about these enormous\r\nfloating leaves is that they are covered with little spiny points on\r\nthe under side and at the margin; that is probably to keep some sort\r\nof fish from nibbling at the edges.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our pond. Beyond the water-lily region and so long\r\nas the water is from twelve to twenty-four feet deep, Pondweeds are\r\nable to grow, and their leaves may be seen in the water, whilst their\r\nstalks stand up above the surface so as to allow wind to scatter the\r\npollen.\r\n\r\nThis depth of twenty-four feet seems at first sight very great, but\r\nit is a mere nothing compared with the regions entirely below the\r\nwater, where certain Stoneworts (_Chara_) and Mosses have been found\r\nflourishing. The former has been dredged up from depths of ninety\r\nfeet, and a little moss was discovered in the Lake of Geneva growing\r\nquite comfortably at a depth of 180 feet below the surface.\r\n\r\nBut it is quite impossible to appreciate the wonder and beauty of the\r\nlife in a pond unless by a strong effort of the imagination.\r\n\r\nSuppose yourself to be a fish two or three inches long, and\r\naccustomed to the dim, mysterious light which filters down through\r\nthe water from the sky above. Every here and there great olive-brown\r\nleaf-stalks and stems cross and, branching, intercept the light.\r\nEverything, the surface of the mud, the stems and branches of the\r\nsubmerged water-plants, is covered by an exquisite golden-brown\r\npowder, which consists of hundreds and thousands of \"Diatoms.\" Here\r\nand there from the Pondweed and other stems hang festoons or wreaths\r\nor threads of beautiful green Algæ. Little branching sprays of them,\r\nor perhaps of the brown kind, are attached here and there to the\r\nthick stems.\r\n\r\nEven the very water is full of small, floating, vivid green stars or\r\ncrescents or three-cornered pieces which are free floating Algæ or\r\nDesmids. Other diatoms are also free or swim with a cork-screwing\r\nmotion through the water. Great snails and slugs crawl upon the\r\nplants, and weird large-eyed creatures, with a superfluity of legs\r\nand an entire absence of reserve as to what is going on inside their\r\nbodies, skirmish around. So that such a pond is full of vegetable\r\nactivity. The free-swimming diatoms and desmids make up the food of\r\nthe snails and crustaceans. These latter in turn are the food of\r\nfishes.\r\n\r\nIt is even possible to-day by carefully stocking an artificial pond\r\nwith water plants, by then introducing Mollusca and Crustacea, and\r\nfinally by the introduction of \"eyed ova\" or fry of the trout, carp,\r\nor other fishes, to produce a regular population of fishes which can\r\nbe made more or less profitable, and the process can be spoken of\r\nas \"fish-farming.\" Unfortunately there are a great many gaps in our\r\nknowledge as to what fish actually feed on, and we know even less\r\nabout what the Mollusca and Crustacea require.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a distinct annual harvest of these minute\r\nseaweeds, of which different sorts appear to develop one after the\r\nother, just as flowering plants do. The two months January and\r\nFebruary, which are almost without flowers, are also those in which\r\nmost of these minute vegetables take their repose in the form of\r\ncysts or spores.\r\n\r\nBut these diatoms are too important and too interesting to be\r\ndismissed in such a cursory manner. Each consists of a tiny speck\r\nof living matter with a drop or two of oil enclosed in a variously\r\nsculptured flinty shell. They have, in fact, been compared to little\r\nprotected cruisers which pass to and fro in the water and multiply\r\nwith the most extraordinary rapidity.\r\n\r\nIf you (1) use dynamite to blast a rock, (2) if you employ a\r\nmicroscope or telescope, (3) if you paint an oil picture, (4) if you\r\nmake a sound-proof partition in a set of offices, the probability is\r\nthat it has been necessary to use the substance diatomite in each\r\ncase. This consists of the accumulated shells of myriads of diatoms.\r\n\r\nNor does that represent by any means the whole of the usefulness of\r\nthese tiny seaweeds. The oil shales, such as occur in Linlithgowshire\r\nand elsewhere, are supposed to be the muddy, oily deposits of such\r\nponds as we have endeavoured to describe. The oil found in the shales\r\nwas probably worked up by these diatoms in long-past geological ages.\r\nIt may be used to-day either (1) to drive motors, (2) to light lamps,\r\n(3) to burn as so-called \"wax\" candles, (4) to eat (as an inferior\r\nsort of chocolate cream).\r\n\r\nInteresting as these diatoms are, it is not really possible to\r\nunderstand their structure without the use of a microscope, so that\r\nwe must pass on to another side of the activity of water plants.\r\n\r\nLet us, for instance, notice some of the ordinary plants to be found\r\nalong a riverside. Willows and Alders are the ordinary trees, because\r\nthey are specially fitted to stand the danger of being regularly\r\noverflowed. They easily take root, so that branches broken off and\r\nfloated down are enabled to form new trees without much difficulty.\r\nIn the United States, it has become a custom to plant Willows along\r\nthe banks, because they are then not so liable to be broken down and\r\nworn away. Yet when a big Willow tree has become undermined, the\r\nweight of the trunk may cause it to fall over towards the water, so\r\nthat a large section of the bank may be loosened and serious damage\r\nmay be done if it is torn away by a heavy flood.\r\n\r\nAmongst such Willows, should be mentioned the \"cricket bat\" kind,\r\nwhich has to be grown with the very greatest care, and of which a\r\nsingle tree may be worth £28.\r\n\r\nMany of our rivers are, alas, sadly polluted by artificial and other\r\nimpurities which kill the fishes and destroy the natural vegetation.\r\nWhen this happens a horrible-looking whitish fungus (_Apodytes\r\nlactea_) coats the stones and banks under water and the water swarms\r\nwith bacteria. This fungus and the bacteria are really purifying the\r\nwater, for they break up the decaying matter in it.\r\n\r\nThe oily or slimy character of the outside skin of all submerged\r\nplants is of very great importance to them. It allows the water to\r\nglide or slip over them without any friction.\r\n\r\nStill keeping to our river bank, let us look for submerged plants.\r\nWhat is that dark green feathery plume? It is the Hornwort\r\n(_Ceratophyllum_) gently wriggling or moving from side to side. It\r\nhas probably never been still for a moment since it first began\r\nto grow. Take it out of the water, and it collapses into a moist,\r\nunpleasant little body, but as soon as it is put in its natural\r\nelement again it is seen to have a thin flexible stem along which\r\nthere are circles of curved, finely divided leaves. Watch it in\r\nthe water and one is filled with astonishment at the perfection of\r\nthe shape, arrangement, and character of the leaves, which enables\r\nthem to hold their place even when a flood may cover them with an\r\nextra twenty feet of water! The same sort of leaf, but with great\r\ndifference in detail, is found in the submerged Water Crowfoot,\r\nWater Milfoil, Potamogetons, and others which live under the same\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIf it were the St. John's River, we might see that extraordinary\r\nFlorida Hyacinth which has swollen, gouty-looking leaf-stalks,\r\nand grows with such extraordinary rapidity that it covers the\r\nwhole surface of rivers, choking the paddle-wheels of steamers and\r\ndestroying the trade in timber, for no logs can be floated down when\r\nit covers the water. Its rosettes float on the surface, and are very\r\ninteresting to examine. If you upset one or turn it upside down in\r\nthe water, the \"buoys\" or swollen stalks act as a self-righting\r\narrangement, and it slowly returns to its proper position.\r\n\r\nBut in most rivers, one is certain to come across backwaters where\r\nit is impossible to force a boat through on account of the reeds and\r\nother marsh-plants.\r\n\r\nThere are places on the Danube where hundreds of square miles are\r\noccupied by waving masses of the feathery-plumed Phragmites, almost\r\nto the exclusion of any other sort of vegetation. Giant specimens of\r\nit eighteen feet high have been observed.\r\n\r\nThe same reed occurs in North and South America and far up towards\r\nthe Arctic regions. At first sight it seems as if this was a mistake\r\nof Nature; why should so much of the surface be occupied by this\r\nuseless vegetable? But it is necessary to say a little more about\r\nits habits and its object in life.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting and curious point is the way in which it grows\r\nin dense thickets; the main stem is really horizontal and below the\r\nwater, but it gives off a number of upright stalks. Now every flood\r\nwill carry in amongst the stalks quantities of silt and rubbish.\r\nThose upright stems will sift the water: all sorts of floating\r\nmaterial, sand, silt, dead leaves, fruit, etc., are left amongst\r\nthem. So that such a marsh or bed of Phragmites is gradually, flood\r\nby flood, collecting the deposits of mud, and the bed becomes every\r\nyear more shallow. At the edge of the marsh there is scarcely any\r\nwater visible, and grasses and other plants are beginning to grow\r\nbetween the Phragmites stems. Eventually these latter are choked out,\r\nand a marshy alluvial flat occupies the site of the old reed-bed.\r\n\r\nSo that the work of Phragmites is of the greatest possible\r\nimportance: it has to form those fertile alluvial flats which are\r\nfound along the course of every great river, and which are by far the\r\nmost valuable lands in the whole world.\r\n\r\nLook, for instance, at the population of Belgium, Holland, and Lower\r\nGermany, and notice how dense it is upon the alluvial flats where the\r\nMeuse, Rhine, and other rivers approach the sea. It is just the same\r\nin Britain. London lies on the great alluvial flats of the Thames,\r\nGlasgow on the Clyde, Liverpool on the Mersey. In China it is the\r\nYang-tze-kiang valley (especially near its mouth); in India, the\r\nGanges, of lower Bengal, and in the Argentine the La Plata River,\r\nwhich show the greatest accumulations of humanity. In every case it\r\nis the rich flat alluvium, which is exceedingly fertile when drained\r\nand cultivated, that has originally attracted so many people.\r\n\r\nLower Egypt is the gift of the Nile, but it is not so much the Nile\r\nas these neglected water plants which made the rich lucerne, cotton,\r\nand food crops of Lower Egypt possible. Amongst the Egyptian Reeds\r\none especially is of great importance. The _Papyrus antiquorum_,\r\nten feet high, has much the same habit as our Phragmites and other\r\nwater plants. It forms dense, almost impassable thickets, sometimes\r\ncompletely occupying and choking a small valley, or leaving only\r\na passage, often changing and half choked, through a larger one.\r\nThis, with other plants, makes the \"sudd\" of the Nile, which is one\r\nenormous accumulation of marsh plants and reeds floating on the water\r\nand covering a length of over 500 miles.\r\n\r\nIt was from the Papyrus that the ancient Egyptians made their paper.\r\nThe stems are six to seven inches in diameter. \"The pith of the\r\nlarger flowering stems ... cut into thin strips, united together by\r\nnarrowly overlapping margins, and then crossed under pressure by\r\na similar arrangement of strips at right angles, constitutes the\r\nPapyrus of antiquity.\"\r\n\r\nThese great marshes and reed-beds are full of interest to\r\nnaturalists. The Fens of Lincolnshire and the Norfolk Broads show the\r\nway in which water plants keep hold of the worn and travelled rubbish\r\nof the hills, and prevent most of it from becoming useless, barren\r\nsea-sands. These places, however, like the sudd of the Nile, and\r\nthe Roman \"Campagna,\" have an evil reputation so far as climate is\r\nconcerned. This used to be the case even in lower Chelsea, in London\r\n(where snipe were shot not so very long ago). It is as if Nature had\r\ndesired to do her own work in peace and without being disturbed, for\r\nfever, ague, mosquitoes, and malaria are very common. Yet a certain\r\nnumber of people always live in such places. In France, e.g., the\r\nleeches in the great marshes near the Landes form a source of riches.\r\nSuch reeds also are or were the home of the hippopotamus, crocodile,\r\nand other extraordinary animals. The extinct British hippopotamus\r\nno doubt found in the Chelsea or other marshes a home as congenial\r\nto its tastes as is the sudd of Egypt to its living descendants or\r\nallies. In other places the enormous quantities of water birds,\r\nmyriads of ducks, geese, swans, regiments of flamingoes, snipe, and\r\nthe like, have called into existence peculiar kinds of industry in\r\nfowling and netting that are not without importance. The decoys in\r\nthe Fens yield hundreds of birds for the London market, and the\r\nduck-punts with their huge guns also bring in quantities of wild fowl.\r\n\r\nBut all this industry is very trifling compared with that of\r\nPhragmites and its associates, who have strained from the water of\r\nthe Thames most of the ground on which London now stands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nON GRASSLANDS\r\n\r\n   Where is peace?--Troubles of the grass--Roadsides--Glaciers\r\n   in Switzerland--Strength and gracefulness of\r\n   grasses--Rainstorms--Dangers of drought and of\r\n   swamping--Artificial fields--Farmer's abstruse\r\n   calculations--Grass mixtures--Tennis lawns--The invasion of\r\n   forest--Natural grass--Prairie of the United States, Red Indian,\r\n   Cowboy--Pampas and Gaucho--Thistles and tall stories--South\r\n   Africa and Boers--Hunting of the Tartars--An unfortunate Chinese\r\n   princess--Australian shepherds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere should one seek for peace on earth? The ideal chosen for one\r\nwell-known picture is a grassy down \"close clipt by nibbling sheep,\"\r\nsuch as the fresh green turf of the South Downs.\r\n\r\nOthers might prefer the \"Constable country,\" near perhaps the famous\r\n\"Valley Farm\" of which the picture now hangs in the National Gallery,\r\nand especially in early spring. At any rate, once seen, one remembers\r\nfor ever afterwards those glossy-coated, well-fed, leisurely cows\r\ngrazing hock-deep in rich meadows full of bright flowers and graceful\r\ngrasses, through which there winds a very lazy river bordered by trim\r\npollarded willows.\r\n\r\nThe charm of the South Downs and of Constable's meadows depends upon\r\ntheir peaceful quiet, and the absence of any sign of the handiwork of\r\ndisturbing man.\r\n\r\nBut such meadows are entirely artificial. They could no more\r\nexist in nature than a coal-mine, if it were not for man's help.\r\nMoreover, they are in a state of perpetual war! No plant within them\r\nexperiences the blessings of peace from the time it germinates until\r\nthe day that it dies.\r\n\r\nEach plant is fighting with its neighbours for light, for air, for\r\nwater, and for salts in the soil, and it is also trying to protect\r\nitself against grazing animals, against the vole which gnaws its\r\nroots, and against the insects and caterpillars which try to devour\r\nits buds.\r\n\r\nBesides its own private and individual troubles, it is but one of a\r\nwhole company or army of plants which, like a cooperative society,\r\noccupy the field.\r\n\r\nOther societies, such as peat-moss, thickets, and woods, try to drive\r\nout the grasses and cover that particular place in its stead. The\r\nGrassland companions are also always trying to take up new ground,\r\nand to cover over any which is not strongly held by other plants.\r\n\r\nA road, for instance, is always being attacked by the grassland near\r\nit. It is sure to have a distinct border of Rat's Tail Plantain,\r\nDandelion, Creeping Buttercup, and Yellow Clovers. These are the\r\nadvanced guard of the grassland. However heavily you tread upon these\r\nplants, you will do them no injury whatever, for they are specially\r\ndesigned to resist heavy weights. But, if the road were only left\r\nalone, these bordering plants would be very soon choked out. The\r\nordinary buttercup would replace the creeping species, and white or\r\nred clovers take the place of the little yellow ones, whilst grasses\r\nwould very soon spring up all over it.\r\n\r\nBut of course the roadman comes and scrapes off all the new growth of\r\ncolonizing grasses, etc. Then the plantains, dandelions, and yellow\r\nclovers patiently begin their work again.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & Underwood_\r\n  _London & New York_\r\n\r\n  THE FELLING OF GIANT TREES IN CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n  These sequoias grow to from 250 to 400 feet high, though they are\r\n  not quite the tallest trees in the world.\r\n\r\n  (See page 47.)]\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland, in those valleys in which the glaciers are melting\r\naway, leaving stretches of bare mud, scratched stones, and polished\r\nrock, plants immediately begin to settle there. A Swiss botanist\r\nwatched the process during five or six years, and describes how\r\nfirst the yellow Saxifrage (_S. aizoides_) establishes itself. Next\r\nseason Coltsfoot, willow-herb, Oxyria, and two grasses had planted\r\nthemselves. During the third season another grass came in. By the\r\nfourth season, Fescues and yarrow had appeared, and by the fifth\r\nseason, five grasses, clovers, and yarrow had formed a regular\r\ngrassland upon the new untouched soil.[104]\r\n\r\n  [104] Coaz, _Mittheilungen d. Naturf_, Berne, 1886.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, Nature, who abhors bare ground, is endeavouring to\r\nclothe it with useful vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe fights which are going on are of the most ruthless character.\r\nMany weeds are said to produce some 30,000 seeds in one year, and\r\nevery plant which grows in a meadow is scattering thousands of seeds.\r\nBut of course the number of plants remains much the same, so that\r\n29,999 seeds are wasted (or the seedlings choked out) for every one\r\nthat grows up!\r\n\r\nIt is probably because of this perpetual warfare that the growth of\r\nthe grasses is so vigorous, and their whole structure so perfectly\r\nadapted. If you watch a flowering grass, you are sure to notice how\r\nnarrow is its stem compared with the height. A factory chimney only\r\nfifty-eight feet high requires to be at least four feet broad at\r\nthe base, yet a ryeplant 1500 millimetres high may be only three\r\nmillimetres broad near the root. Man's handiwork, the chimney, is in\r\nheight seventeen times its diameter, but the height of the grass is\r\n500 times its diameter.\r\n\r\nThe neatness of design, the graceful curves and perfect balance in\r\nthe little flowering branches at the top of a haulm, is always worth\r\nlooking at, and particularly in the early morning when it is beset\r\nwith sparkling drops of dew.\r\n\r\nIt is all wiry, bending and swaying to the wind so as to produce\r\nthose waves which roll across a hay-field, and on which the\r\nshimmering light is reflected and changes colour. The fight for light\r\nand air, the struggle to get their heads up above their competitors,\r\nproduces all this exquisite mechanism.\r\n\r\nIt is true that a heavy rainstorm may beat the stems flat down to\r\nthe ground, but, as soon as the weather becomes dry again these\r\nsame stems will raise themselves up and become upright; they have a\r\nspecial sensitiveness and a special kind of growth which enables them\r\nto do this.\r\n\r\nThere are two special dangers which all such artificial meadows have\r\nto withstand. Let us see what will happen if such a meadow begins to\r\ndry up through a sinking of the level of the water below the soil.\r\n\r\nEach grass has its own special favourite amount of moisture. It likes\r\nto have its water at just one particular depth below the surface.\r\nUnfortunately there are not nearly enough sympathetic and careful\r\nobservations of the preferences of each individual grass. A Danish\r\nauthor has worked out the facts in certain localities (Geest).\r\nSuppose first that the water-level of the wells, etc., is 6-1/2\r\nto 9-3/4 feet below the surface. This suits the Meadow Poa grass\r\n(_Poa pratensis_) exactly. It will grow luxuriantly and flourish.\r\nNow suppose the weather is very wet, so that the water rises in the\r\nwells till they are three to four feet deep. The Roughish Poa (_P.\r\ntrivialis_) prefers this moister soil, and it will grow so vigorously\r\nthat it will kill out the other kind. If it is a season of very\r\nheavy floods, or if the drains become choked so that the water rises\r\nto within fourteen to twenty-five inches of the surface, then the\r\ntufted Aira (_Deschampsia caespitosa_) will kill out the other kinds\r\nand flourish abundantly. But if the water rises higher than this the\r\nmarsh series comes in (see Chap. XVI.).\r\n\r\nSo that the thirsty grasses of the meadow are helped or hindered in\r\ntheir fight for life by changes in the water away down in the soil\r\nbelow their roots.\r\n\r\nEven in Great Britain one can see distinct differences in very dry\r\nand very wet summers, but all these pastures, meadowlands, and\r\nhay-fields are, as we have already mentioned, as much due to man's\r\nforethought and industry as a factory or coal-mine.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to realize this. The best way is to go to the\r\nNational, or any other good picture-gallery, and look carefully\r\nat any landscapes painted before the year 1805. You will scarcely\r\nbelieve that the country as painted can be the land we know. Where is\r\nthe \"awful orderliness\" of England? Where are the trim hedges? Where\r\nare the tidy roadsides and beautifully embanked rivers that we see\r\nto-day?\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, until the great Macadam made good roads and\r\nthe great Telford and other engineers built stone bridges, it was\r\nimpossible to rely on getting about with carts and carriages.\r\nGentlemen's coaches and wagons used to be literally stuck in the mud!\r\nHorses were drowned at fords, or died in their struggles to pull very\r\nlight loads through mud which nearly reached the axles of the wheels\r\n(see Chap. XI.).\r\n\r\nBesides the change due to roads, fences, drains, and farm buildings,\r\nthe very grasses themselves are growing unnaturally. The farmer has\r\nselected and sown what he thinks best.\r\n\r\nHe is obliged to do so, because grasses vary so much. Some of them\r\nshoot up quickly and die after the first year. Others live for two\r\nyears, whilst a great many bide their time, developing very slowly,\r\nand not reaching their full growth until the fourth or fifth year.\r\n\r\nSome are tall and vigorous, others are short; some flower early in\r\nthe season, and others very late. Many send out quantities of suckers\r\nor runners at the base, so that they form a dense, intricate turf--a\r\nmass of stems and roots thickly covering the ground.\r\n\r\nA farmer wants his pasture to begin early and to continue late; he\r\nmust have a good first year's crop, and it must remain good for years\r\nafterwards. So that his calculations as regards the proportions of\r\nthe different grass seeds which he requires are of the most abstruse\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nTo sow such \"permanent pasture,\" prepared by blending together\r\ngrasses and clovers with an eye to all the above necessities, there\r\nwill be needed some seven million seeds for every acre.\r\n\r\nThe art consists in coaxing the good, lasting, nutritious ones to\r\nmake both tall hay, rich aftermath, and a close, thick turf below,\r\nand, until these are ready, to use the annual and biennial grasses.\r\n\r\nSuch beautifully shaven, green, soft turf as one sees in the lawns\r\nof cathedrals or the \"quads\" at Oxford and Cambridge has been most\r\ncarefully and regularly watered, rolled, and mown for hundreds of\r\nyears. It is not easy to keep even a tennis-lawn in good condition.\r\nLittle tufts of daisies appear. Their leaves lie so flat that they\r\nescape the teeth of the mower, and they are not so liable to be\r\ninjured by tennis-shoes as the tiny upright grass-shoots which are\r\ntrying to spring up everywhere. The Plantain is even worse, for it\r\nis specially built to stand heavy weights, and it has several roots\r\nwhich divide and branch like the prongs which fix teeth in the jaw,\r\nso that it is very difficult to howk it out.\r\n\r\nThus our grasslands in Britain are unnatural and artificial\r\nproductions. If the field drains are choked, moss or fog and rushes\r\nappear. Still more interesting, however, is what happens if the\r\nfarmer is not careful to destroy the taller weeds, such as Dock,\r\nRagweed, Cow Parsnip, Thistles, and the like. If you walk over a\r\ngrass-field in early spring, you are sure to see some of these\r\npests. At this stage they have a very humble, weak, and innocent\r\nappearance: they are quite small rosettes or tufts. Yet they are\r\ncrowded with leaves, which are hard at work busily manufacturing food\r\nmaterial. Soon they begin to shoot up. Their leaves overreach all the\r\nneighbouring grasses. Their roots spread in every direction, taking\r\nwhat ought to go to the \"good green herb intended for the service of\r\nman.\" They finally accomplish their wickedness by producing thousands\r\nof seeds, which are scattered broadcast over the fields.\r\n\r\nBy this time the farmer sees what is going on, and endeavours to cut\r\nthem down; but it is a long, slow, and laborious proceeding. One\r\nyear's seeding means seven years' weeding.\r\n\r\nYet these tall Thistles and Ragweeds are only the first stage of\r\na very interesting invasion. Look around the field corners, on\r\nrailway-banks, or in old quarries, where man has left things alone.\r\nYou will see these same tall herbs (the Ragweed, etc.), but you\r\nare sure to find a place where they are being suppressed by Rasps,\r\nBriers, and Brambles. These are taller, stronger, and more vigorous\r\nthan the herbs, and they also last longer, for their leaves are still\r\nat work in November. This is the second stage of the invasion. But\r\nif the place has been long neglected, Hawthorns and Rowans, Birch and\r\nAsh will be found growing up. These last show what is happening.\r\n\r\nA wood is trying to grow up on the grassland. If left alone, an oak\r\nor beech forest would, after many years, spread over all our grass\r\npastures and hay-fields. These tall herbs are the pioneers, and the\r\nbriers and brambles are its advanced guard.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, by far the greatest part of our agricultural\r\nland _was_ a forest, but it has been cut down, drained, dug, weeded,\r\nhedged, and \"huzzed and maazed\" with agricultural implements and more\r\nor less scientifically selected manures, until it is made to yield\r\ngood beef, excellent mutton, and almost the largest crops per acre in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nNatural grasslands exist, however, in every continent.\r\n\r\nThe great Steppes of Southern Russia and the pastures that extend\r\nfar to the eastward even to the very borders of China, the Prairies\r\nof North America, the Pampas of Argentina, the great sheep-farms of\r\nAustralia, and a large proportion of South Africa, consist of wide,\r\ntreeless, grassy plains, where forests only occur along the banks of\r\nrivers, in narrow hill-valleys, or upon mountains of considerable\r\naltitude. Upon these great plateaux or undulating hills the rainfall,\r\nthough it is but small in amount, is equally distributed, so that\r\nthere is no lengthy and arid dry season. Take the American Prairie,\r\nfor instance. These valuable lands, once the home of unnumbered\r\nbison and hordes of antelopes, lie between the ancient forests of\r\nthe eastern states and the half-deserts and true salt deserts of the\r\nextreme west. Rivers, accompanied in their windings by riverside\r\nforests, are found (especially in the east). The real prairie has\r\na blackish, loamy soil, covered sometimes by the rich Buffalo or\r\nMesquite grass, which forms a short, velvety covering, not exactly a\r\nturf such as we find in England, but still true grassland. It is only\r\ngreen in early spring.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A BUSHMAN DIGGING UP ELEPHANT'S FOOT\r\n\r\n  The Bushman is levering up the root of elephant's foot to get the\r\n  starchy food inside. He does it by a stick run through a rounded\r\n  stone. The woman has caught a lizard for the boy to eat.]\r\n\r\nFrom the spring onwards until the end of summer there is an endless\r\nsuccession of flowers. The first spring blossoms appear in April;\r\ngreat stretches are covered with Pentstemons, Cypripediums, and\r\nmany others in May and June; then follow tall, herbaceous Phloxes,\r\nLilies, and Asclepiads, but perhaps the most characteristic flora\r\nblossoms still later on, when every one \"wants to be in Kansas when\r\nthe Sunflowers bloom.\" Over these prairies used to travel the great\r\nwagons or \"prairie schooners.\" The cowboy, who almost lives on\r\nhorseback, watches over great herds of cattle and troops of half-wild\r\nhorses. Yet his life is, or used to be, almost as free, comfortless,\r\nand uncivilized as that of the buffalo-hunting Indian who preceded\r\nhim. One must not forget to mention the prairie-dog--able to utilize\r\nthe abundant grass, and diving into a safe refuge underground when\r\nthreatened by the wolves or other carnivorous creatures, which, of\r\ncourse, multiplied exceedingly, thanks to the jack-hare, antelopes,\r\nand bisons.\r\n\r\nThe Pampas in South America is a similar grassland. On the east\r\nit stops at the woodlands along the great Plate River, but on the\r\nwest it becomes gradually more dry and arid, until long before the\r\nAndes are reached it is too dry even to carry sheep, and can only be\r\ndescribed as a half-desert.\r\n\r\n\"It is a boundless sea of grasses fading into the distant horizon,\r\nwhich can only be distinguished when the sun is rising or setting.\"\r\nYet amongst the grasses are hundreds of flowers, and, a fact which\r\nis very remarkable, many of them, such as Fennel, Artichoke, Milk\r\nThistle, Burdock, Rye Grass, etc., are European plants which have\r\ndispossessed the natives over miles of country, exactly as the gaucho\r\nhas driven away or exterminated the Indians who lived there. It is\r\ncovered by tufts of grass betwixt which appears the rich alluvial\r\nearth, yet in good years it may become almost a perfect grass floor.\r\n\"The colour changes greatly, for in spring when the old grass is\r\nburnt off, it is coal-black, which changes to a bright blue-green as\r\nsoon as the young leaves appear; later on it becomes brownish green,\r\nwhich again changes when the silver-white flowers come out to the\r\nappearance of a rolling, waving sea of shining silver.\"\r\n\r\nHere would be the place to mention how an army encamped upon the\r\nPampas finds itself next morning imprisoned and doomed to perish\r\nmiserably in a forest of giant thistles which has sprung up during\r\nthe night. There is no doubt that thistles and other weeds are very\r\ntall in both South and North America. Fennels are ten to twelve feet\r\nhigh, and even little Chenopodiums (such as in England may reach\r\neighteen inches), become in South America seven to eight feet high,\r\nbut the tallness of some of the stories is more remarkable even than\r\nthat of the plants!\r\n\r\nOver the Pampas used to roam thousands of guanacos (a creature of the\r\nmost unlovely type, which resembles both a camel, a mule, a deer,\r\nand a horse); here also were Darwin's ostriches (_Rhea Darwinii_)\r\nand other game, which were caught by the lasso and by the peculiar\r\n\"bolas\" of the Indians. They used to surround the herds and then\r\nmassacre them by hundreds. The \"tuco tuco\" also, which is a burrowing\r\nrodent with habits very like those of the prairie dog, finds plenty\r\nof sustenance in the abundant grasses. Upon them subsist pumas,\r\nfoxes, and other carnivores.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the Pampas gradually changes from being very\r\nfertile on the east to being almost a desert on the west. Here is\r\nthe place to mention a very interesting, if not romantic, fact.\r\nThe guanaco does _not_ travel hundreds of miles in order to die in\r\none particular spot as soon as it feels ill, but it does resort\r\nespecially to certain spots. There the grass is often a bright, fresh\r\ngreen, for it is plentifully manured, and consequently the guanaco\r\nhelps to encourage the good grasses to occupy a half-desert. On the\r\neastern side of the Pampas great changes are beginning to appear. The\r\nowners of the great camps, haciendas or cattle-ranches let off small\r\nparts of their land to Italian \"colonists.\" These people grow crops\r\nof Indian corn, and when that has been reaped, the valuable Alfalfa\r\nor Lucerne is sown down. This forms the most exquisite and valuable\r\npasture, and consequently far more Shorthorn and Durham cattle can be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThere are in South Africa enormous grassy plains, where once\r\nspringbok and other game used to exist in enormous herds (Wangeman\r\nrecords having seen a herd of antelope four miles long), in spite of\r\nlions and other beasts of prey, and in spite also of the Boer, who\r\nwas as much a horseman as the gaucho or Red Indian. The great buck\r\nwagons of South Africa were almost as much the real homes of the\r\nBoers as the two-roomed huts which make up his \"farms.\"\r\n\r\nThe great Steppes of Russia and Siberia are also grasslands. \"As seen\r\nfrom a distance hills covered by the Stipa grass resemble sand-hills,\r\nbut, when nearer at hand, the sand-grey colour changes into a\r\nsilvery white, and these ever-moving grasses remind one of the\r\nwaves of the ocean and, in spite of their monotony, leave a pleasant\r\nimpression.\"[105]\r\n\r\n  [105] Schimper, _l.c._; Drude, _l.c._\r\n\r\nTulips, Hyacinths, Veronicas, Periwinkles, Scotch Thistles,\r\nEuphorbias, Wormwoods, and other of our common plants or their near\r\ncousins, make up most of the flora of the Steppes. Yet there are\r\nhundreds of others, for it is a vegetation very rich in species.\r\n\r\nIf one reads in Gibbon's stately language of the mode of life of the\r\nHuns, the Scythians, and those other barbarians who, originating\r\nin these huge grasslands, occasionally overflowed and overwhelmed\r\nthe civilization of declining Rome, the resemblance to Red Indians,\r\nPampas Indians, cowboys, gauchos, and Boers is not a little striking.\r\n\r\nRead, for instance, the magnificent account of the great hunting\r\nmatches of the Tartar princes. \"A circle is drawn of many miles in\r\ncircumference, to encompass the game of an extensive district; and\r\nthe troops that form the circle regularly advance towards a common\r\ncentre, where the animals, surrounded on every side, are abandoned to\r\nthe darts of the hunters.\" Both the Red Indians of the Prairie and\r\nthe savages of the Pampas used to surround and destroy the game in\r\nexactly the same way.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Chinese princess given over for political advantages\r\nto a prince of the Huns, \"laments that she had been condemned by her\r\nparents to a distant exile, under a barbarian husband, and complains\r\nthat sour milk was her only drink, raw flesh her only food, a tent\r\nher only palace.\" This describes exactly the ordinary life and home\r\nof the Huns. \"The Scythians of every age have been celebrated as\r\nbold and skilful riders; and constant practice had seated them so\r\nfirmly on horseback, that they were supposed by strangers to perform\r\nthe ordinary duties of civil life--to eat, to drink, and even to\r\nsleep--without dismounting from their steeds.\" Red Indians of Pampas\r\nand Prairie, cowboy and gaucho, lived exactly in the same way.\r\n\r\nIn those pages of Gibbon which treat of the Huns, Scythians, and\r\nother hordes, one recognizes sometimes the wagon of the Boers;\r\nsometimes a migration of the East African Masai; then perhaps it is\r\na weapon that is really the lasso, or a disposition and character\r\nexactly paralleled by the Crows and Blackfeet. Even the great grass\r\nplains of Australia, where the kangaroo, the wallaby, and the dingo\r\nhave been replaced by the sheep and the \"Waler\" horse, one finds, in\r\nthe shepherd and squatter, traits that remind one of the gaucho or\r\nthe cowboy.\r\n\r\nNor is this in the least extraordinary, for when a scanty rainfall\r\nproduces those great limitless rolling seas of grass, Nature provides\r\nfirst large herbivorous animals to eat it down as well as carnivorous\r\nbeasts to keep their numbers in control, until such time as a race of\r\nhorsemen appears, whose domestic cattle replace the bisons, guanacos,\r\nkangaroos, and antelopes, and so assist in replenishing and subduing\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nPOISONS\r\n\r\n   Poisoned arrows--Fish poisons--Manchineel--Curare--A wonderful\r\n   story--Antiaris--Ordeals--The Obi poison--Oracles produced by\r\n   poisons--Plants which make horses crazy and others that remove\r\n   their hair--Australian sheep and the Caustic Creeper--Swelled\r\n   head--Madness by the Darling Pea--Wild and tame animals, how\r\n   they know poisons--How do they tell one another?--The Yew tree,\r\n   when is it, and when is it not poisonous?\r\n\r\n\r\nEven to-day all embryo chemists and doctors are required to \"pass\" in\r\nthe recognition of the more important medicinal plants.\r\n\r\nBut their knowledge is probably very superficial as compared with\r\nthat of a bushman in the Kalahari Desert of South Africa. Every\r\nman, woman, and child in such a tribe knows thoroughly every plant\r\nthat grows in the neighbourhood. His diet is a varied one, for it\r\nincludes maggots, fish, frogs, snakes, white ants, and other horrible\r\ningredients, but he lives mainly on roots, bulbs, and herbs of sorts.\r\nIn times of famine he has had to obtain the most intimate knowledge\r\npossible of many plants, that namely which is obtained by eating\r\nthem, and he has most carefully observed the poisonous kinds. These\r\nlatter have given him, too, a very powerful weapon, for it is the\r\npoisoned arrows which give him the chance of killing game, otherwise\r\nutterly beyond his reach. He is on the fair road to becoming a\r\nhunter and tribesman, instead of being only a member of a morose,\r\noutcast family, always wandering and always hungry.\r\n\r\nProbably poisons were first used in fishing. Many vegetable drugs,\r\nwhen thrown into pools and lakes, have the property of stupefying or\r\nkilling the fish. A great many of these fish poisons are known, and\r\nit is quite easy to use them.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Dyaks of Borneo, screens of basketwork are placed along\r\na stream to prevent the fish escaping. Then the Dyaks collect along\r\neither bank in their canoes. Everybody has a supply of the root\r\nof the tubai (_Menispermum sp._), which they hammer with stones\r\nin the water inside the canoe, so as to extract the poison. At a\r\ngiven signal the poisonous stuff is baled into the river, and very\r\nsoon afterwards a scene of wild excitement begins, for the fish are\r\nspeared or captured with handnets as they rise, stupefied, to the\r\nsurface. The women scoop up the small fry in their nets.[106]\r\n\r\n  [106] Ling Roth, _Journ. Anthrop. Inst._, vol. 22, London, 1892;\r\n  and Mason, _l.c._\r\n\r\nEven at the Sea of Galilee, Tristram mentions that Arabs sometimes\r\nobtain their fish by poisoned bread-crumbs. In the South Sea Islands,\r\nat Tahiti, a poison is obtained from the nuts of a kind of Betonica,\r\nand is used to catch the fish among the reefs near shore.[3] In West\r\nAfrica several fish poisons are in use (e.g. seeds of _Tephrosia\r\nVogelii_), and probably the same methods are used almost everywhere.\r\nThey are by no means extinct even at home, for the occasional poacher\r\nsometimes uses fish poisons.\r\n\r\n2 Tristram, _Land of Israel_; Mason, _Origin of Inventions_, p. 298.\r\n\r\nArrow poison is, however, much more important, and is used by a\r\ngreat number of tribes in almost every part of the world. In 1859,\r\nin a war with the Dyaks of Borneo, the English army lost thirty men\r\nby poisoned arrows. They are deadly weapons, for the dart is a very\r\nthin piece of reed or cane, which has been dipped in the Upas poison\r\n(_Antiaris toxicaria_). It is propelled from a blow pipe, which in\r\npractised hands is able to carry 250 feet. One or two of these darts\r\nmay cause death in two hours' time. The Spaniards, in their conquest\r\nof the West Indian islands, were often defeated by the poisoned\r\narrows of the Caribs. The wounded died in agonies of suffering and\r\ndelirium, sometimes protracted for twenty-four hours after receiving\r\nthe wound.\r\n\r\nThe poison in this case is supposed to have been the Manchineel\r\n(_Hippomane_).\r\n\r\nIt is a handsome tree, but a very dangerous one, for the slightest\r\ncut on the surface produces a flow of a very fine white milk which is\r\nacrid and poisonous. This juice produces temporary or total blindness\r\nif the slightest speck enters the eyes, or even if one sits over\r\na fire made of its wood. It is probably not true that people are\r\nkilled if they merely sleep below it, and grass will probably grow\r\nquite well under its shade, although there are stories which deny\r\nthis. Blowpipes and poisoned darts are used by many savages in Asia\r\nand South America. Perhaps the Curare or Woorali poison is the most\r\nwonderful of the South American kinds. The tree, _Strychnos sp._,\r\ngrows along the Amazon and in the Guianas. The poison is obtained\r\nfrom the wood and bark, and several other vegetable substances are\r\nmixed with it. (This is a very common feature of native drugs and\r\nincreases the chances of doing _something_.) It is a blood poison,\r\nand a very deadly one. Large animals like the tapir stagger about,\r\ncollapse, and die after a very few steps, if they have been wounded\r\nby a dart. Humboldt declares that the earth-eating Otomaks were able\r\nto kill their antagonists by the mere pressure of their poisoned\r\nthumbnails.\r\n\r\nIn Africa it is more usual to find poisoned arrows shot from a bow.\r\nThe exquisitely beautiful seed of _Strophanthus Kombe_ is used as an\r\narrow poison. The plant is a climber found in forests or bush, and\r\nhas large woody pods about seven to twelve inches long. When these\r\nare open, the inside is seen to be full of the small yellowish seeds;\r\neach ends in a fine awn three to four inches long, which carries at\r\nthe end a beautiful tuft of the finest silky hairs. The seed-coat is\r\nalso covered with silk hairs. When viewed against a black surface,\r\nthere is no more lovely object in nature. Yet from the seed-coat a\r\nvery deadly poison is obtained; probably snake-venom and various\r\ngluey substances form part of the mixture, which is daubed on the\r\narrows. Dr. Kolbe saw the Hottentots plastering their arrows with\r\nthe poison of the hooded snake. Bushmen use a Lily bulb, _Haemanthus\r\ntoxicarius_, but sometimes add part of the inside of a small\r\ncaterpillar.\r\n\r\nAnother African poison which is not so well known is the\r\n_Acokanthera_, which was the ingredient in the arrows obtained by the\r\nwriter in British East Africa.\r\n\r\nNorth America is singularly free from these unsportsmanlike and\r\nhorrible weapons, but they were not unknown in Europe in very\r\nancient times. Pliny speaks of the Arabian pirates as poisoners,\r\nand allusions to their use of deadly arrows can be found in Horace,\r\nOvid, and Homer. In the _Odyssey_, the hero goes to Ephyra (Epirus?)\r\nto purchase a deadly arrow poison, but he is refused for fear of the\r\neternal gods. Poisoned arrows were employed by the Celts in Gaul, and\r\nalso by the Saracens in the War of Granada in 1484.\r\n\r\nYet even in the time of Homer the sense of humanity seems to have\r\ndecided against poisoned arrows as being both unnecessary and cruel,\r\njust as, in our own times, explosive bullets have been condemned, and\r\nare no longer used by civilized nations. But we should remember that\r\nuntil man became so expert with the bow and spear and so civilized by\r\ntribal fights as to be able to do without poisons, they were a very\r\nuseful help in the struggle for civilization. Hundreds of thin pieces\r\nof bamboo about six inches long were regularly carried by certain\r\nAfrican tribes. When dipped in poison and afterwards placed in paths\r\nin the ground, they formed a very efficient protection against\r\nbarefooted enemies.\r\n\r\nThe Antiaris alluded to above is the famous Upas tree of Java. The\r\ntree was _said_ to grow in a desert with not another living plant\r\nwithin ten miles of it. Such was the virulence of its poison that\r\nthere were no fish in the waters. Neither rat, nor mouse, nor any\r\nother vermin had ever been seen there; and when any birds flew so\r\nnear this tree that the effluvia reached them, they fell dead--a\r\nsacrifice to the effects of its poison. Out of a population of\r\nsixteen hundred persons who were compelled, on account of civil\r\ndissensions, to reside within twelve or fourteen miles of the tree,\r\nnot more than three hundred remained alive in two months. Criminals\r\ncondemned to die were offered the chance of life if they would go to\r\nthe Upas tree and collect some of the poison. They were provided with\r\nmasks (not unlike our modern motor-veils), and yet not two in twenty\r\nreturned from the expedition.\r\n\r\nAll the foregoing statements were for years implicitly believed. They\r\nwere vouched for by a Dutch surgeon resident in Java. Medicine is a\r\nprofession, and Holland is a country which would in no way lead one\r\nto expect such magnificent mendacious audacity!\r\n\r\nFor the whole of the preceding statements about Antiaris is pure\r\nromance. The inner bark of young trees, when made into coarse\r\ngarments, produces an extremely painful itching, whilst the dried\r\njuice is a virulent arrow poison.\r\n\r\nHellebore and Aconite were the favourite poisons of the Marquise de\r\nBrinvilliers and other specialists of the Middle Ages. The Christmas\r\nRoses or Hellebores were known to be poisonous fourteen hundred years\r\nbefore the Christian era, and are still used in medicine. Aconite,\r\nwhich has a tuberous root-stock, is dangerous, for it is occasionally\r\neaten in mistake for the horse-radish, to which it has a faint\r\nresemblance. All kinds of aconite are poisonous. That of one of the\r\nIndian species is used to tip the arrows employed in shooting tigers.\r\n\r\nTrials by ordeal were very common in ancient times. The theory was\r\nthat an innocent person was not injured by certain drugs, which,\r\nhowever, proved immediately fatal to the guilty.\r\n\r\nSuch trials at one time were customary in almost every part of the\r\nworld. They were supposed to be perfectly just, so that no man could\r\nbe held guilty of the death of those who succumbed. In practice,\r\nhowever, they were almost invariably corrupt. The _Tanghinia\r\nvenenifera_ of Madagascar was regularly used in ordeals, and is\r\nprobably still employed by certain tribes. The seeds are exceedingly\r\npoisonous, but, if the authorities wish the accused person to escape,\r\na strong emetic is mixed with the powdered seeds, and the poison has\r\nno time to act. This, however, is seldom the case, for in any savage\r\nnation no one who is popular and in good esteem with the king or\r\nother people in authority is at all likely to be accused. The fact\r\nof his being accused means in most cases that he is already condemned\r\nto die. Another ordeal plant is the Calabar Bean (_Physostigma\r\nvenenosa_), found in West Africa. The plant is a climber belonging to\r\nthe _Leguminosæ_, and the seeds, which are about an inch in diameter,\r\nare very deadly. The seed is conspicuously marked by the long,\r\ndark, sunken scar, where it was attached to the pod. Besides being\r\nexceedingly poisonous, it has also a curious effect upon the pupil of\r\nthe eye, which is contracted by this drug.[107]\r\n\r\n  [107] The pupil of the eye is _enlarged_ by belladonna.\r\n\r\nAnother famous poison is produced from _Datura stramonium_ and allied\r\nspecies. In tropical and sub-tropical countries, one is almost\r\nsure to find specimens of this handsome plant along almost every\r\nroadside. It is in fact one of the commonest tropical weeds. The\r\nleaves are large with fine spinose margins, and the flower is most\r\nconspicuous, as it is four or five inches long. This is supposed to\r\nbe one of the drugs employed by the Obi wizards and witches. The most\r\nhorrible rites, accompanied by atrocious cruelties, were performed\r\namongst certain West African tribes and are continued amongst their\r\ndescendants, the freed slaves of the West Indies and of the Southern\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nEven to-day no white man is allowed to learn anything of the\r\nproceedings, but some form of devil-worship or Shamanism, accompanied\r\nby incantations and the use of poisonous drugs, still flourishes.\r\nPreparations of various sorts of Datura or Thorn-apple produce\r\nsometimes stupefaction, sometimes frantic, furious delirium, and\r\nsometimes death.\r\n\r\nIt is used in medicine as a narcotic and diuretic. Burton says\r\nthat the Arabs smoke the leaves in pipes as a cure for influenza\r\nand asthma. It is sometimes used in Europe for neuralgia and even\r\nepilepsy. On the other hand, the priests of the ancient Peruvians\r\nused Datura to produce the ravings mistaken for inspiration, and it\r\nis supposed that the priests of Apollo at Delphi employed an allied\r\nspecies for the same purpose. In India, China, West Africa, and\r\namongst the American blacks, it is still very commonly used.\r\n\r\nA firm belief existed in the Middle Ages that every plant was a\r\ngood remedy for something. There is a real basis in fact for this\r\nsuperstition, because every plant in the world has, so far as it\r\ncan do so, to protect itself. The attacks of all sorts of grazing\r\nanimals, from the mouse to the elephant, as well as the infinitely\r\nmore dangerous and destructive insects, bacteria, and fungi, have\r\nto be provided for. By far the commonest form of protection is to\r\ndevelop within the plant strong medicinal or strongly smelling\r\nsubstances. These are far better as protective agents than the thorns\r\nand spines characteristic of deserts and half-deserts. We have\r\nalready glanced at the turpentines and resins of Coniferous forests\r\nand at the odorous gums, frankincense, and myrrh of the Acacia scrub.\r\n\r\nThe use of poisons as protection is eminently characteristic of\r\nthree of the natural orders. The Buttercups (_Ranunculaceæ_), the\r\nPotato order (_Solanaceæ_) and the Lilies. Of the first named, the\r\ncelery-leaved, and indeed all Buttercups, are extremely poisonous;\r\nso also are all Aconites and Hellebores, as well as Marsh Marigold,\r\nAdonis, Clematis, and Larkspur.\r\n\r\nOthers, though not poisonous, are strongly medicinal, such as Blake\r\nSnakeroot, Hydrastis, etc. It is therefore inadvisable to use any of\r\nthis order for food unless other people have eaten it without any\r\ninconvenience!\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the Lily order does not prevent it from being a\r\nparticularly dangerous group of plants. Perhaps the worst poisons in\r\nthis order are those of the Meadow Saffron (_Colchicum autumnale_),\r\nHerb Paris, Veratrum, Sabadilla, Lily of the Valley, Tulip, and Crown\r\nImperial bulbs. Chamælirium, Trillium, Squills, Garlic, Solomon's\r\nSeal, Aloes, and the Sarsaparillas are all well-known medicines.\r\n\r\nThe order _Solanaceæ_ is perhaps the most interesting, for it\r\nincludes such dangerous poisons as Tobacco, Datura, _Atropa\r\nbelladonna_ (Deadly Nightshade), Henbane, Bittersweet (_Solanum\r\ndulcamara_), Common Nightshade (_Solanum nigrum_), and a very great\r\nmany important drugs. Even the common potato contains a poisonous\r\nsecretion _solanin_, and it is dangerous to eat green potatoes or\r\nthe foliage. Yet the Tomato or Love Apple (so called because it was\r\nsupposed to excite tender feelings) is both nutritious and delicious.\r\nChillies and Cayenne Pepper (_Capsicum spp._) are also commonly used\r\nas condiments.\r\n\r\nSuch poisonous orders should of course be avoided, but much\r\nmore dangerous are those deadly plants which appear as it were\r\naccidentally in orders which are amongst the most useful friends\r\nof man. Amongst the grasses there is the deadly Darnel (_Lolium\r\ntemulentum_), a first cousin and not very unlike the very commonest\r\nand one of the most useful grasses--Rye Grass (_Lolium perenne_).\r\n\r\nThen in the useful Carrot order, there are such dangerous and even\r\ndeadly plants as Fool's Parsley, Water Dropwort, and Cowbane.\r\n_OEnanthe crocata_ (Water Dropwort) is one of the very commonest\r\nmarsh and ditch plants in Great Britain. It is perfectly well known\r\nto botanists as distinctly poisonous, yet in 1902 a veterinary\r\nsurgeon brought me some of the tuberous roots to name, and told me\r\nthat six fine young cows were lying dead on a neighbouring farm\r\nthrough having eaten them!\r\n\r\nA particularly useful order of plants (_Leguminosæ_), the Beans\r\nand Peas, contains a few poisonous species. It is said that in\r\nevery year children are sure to be killed by eating the seeds of\r\nthe Laburnum, and to this order belong also the Calabar Bean and\r\nCrab's Eyes. The last named is only fatal when introduced below the\r\nskin in small quantities. The seeds of the Bitter Vetch (_Lathyrus\r\nsativus_) produce paralysis of the legs in man and also in horses.\r\nThe Crazy or Loco weed of North America is sometimes eaten by horses\r\nin the Western United States. The wretched animals stagger about as\r\nif intoxicated, and eventually die. Belonging to this same order is\r\nthe Wild Tamarind, or Jumbai, of Jamaica (_Leucæna glauca_). It is a\r\nweedy-looking acacia, and extremely common in all tropical countries.\r\nDr. D. Morris thus alludes to it:--[108]\r\n\r\n  [108] British Association, Liverpool, 1896, Section K.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Robert Russell, of St. Ann's, informs me that horses feeding on\r\nthe leaves of this plant completely lose the hair from their manes\r\nand tails. This ... statement was supported by the testimony of\r\nso many people acquainted with the facts that there was no reason\r\nto doubt it. Many years afterwards (in December, 1895), I renewed\r\nmy acquaintance with the plant in the Bahamas. The plant was much\r\nmore plentiful there than in Jamaica; it was, in fact, distinctly\r\nencouraged in the former islands as a fodder plant. The people were\r\nfully aware of the singular effect it produced on horses, and added\r\nthat it also affected mules and donkeys. Its effect on pigs was still\r\nmore marked. These animals assumed a completely naked condition, and\r\nappeared without a single hair on their body. Horses badly affected\r\nby Jumbai were occasionally seen in the streets of Nassau, where\r\nthey were known as 'cigar-tails.' Such depilated animals, although\r\napparently healthy, were considerably depreciated in value. They\r\nwere said to recover when fed exclusively on corn and grass. The\r\nnew hair was, however, of a different colour and texture, 'so the\r\nanimals were never quite the same.' One animal was cited as having\r\nlost its hoofs as well, and in consequence it had to be kept in\r\nslings until they grew again and hardened. The effects of the Jumbai\r\non horses, mules, donkeys, and pigs were regarded as accidental--due\r\nto neglect or ignorance. The plant was really encouraged to supply\r\nfood for cattle, sheep, and goats. The latter greedily devoured it\r\nand were not perceptibly affected by it. It will be noticed that\r\nthe animals affected were non-ruminants, while those not affected\r\nwere ruminants. The probable explanation is that the ruminants, by\r\nthoroughly mixing the food with saliva and slowly digesting it, were\r\nenabled to neutralize the action of the poison and escape injury.\r\nThe seeds probably contain the deleterious principle in a greater\r\ndegree than any other part of the plant. It was a common experience\r\nthat animals introduced from other localities suffered more than the\r\nnative animals. The latter were either immune or had learnt to avoid\r\nthe plant as noxious to them.\"\r\n\r\nThat animals resident in a district are not poisoned by plants which\r\nare often fatal to sheep and cattle when on the march through it, has\r\nbeen often observed in Australia. The great \"mobs\" or droves of sheep\r\npassing slowly on their travels through the bush to a new district\r\nare often poisoned by the Caustic Creeper (_Euphorbia Drummondi_).\r\n\"The head swells to an enormous extent, becoming so heavy that the\r\nanimal cannot support it, and drags it along the ground\"; but this\r\ndoes not apparently happen to resident cattle. Similarly for the\r\nDarling Pea or Indigo (_Swainsonia galegifolia_). At one place this\r\nwas growing abundantly where some travelling horses were hobbled for\r\nthe night. \"They had been on the road some nine weeks, and were up to\r\nthis date caught without any difficulty. On this occasion ... their\r\neyes were staring out of their heads, and they were prancing against\r\ntrees and shrubs.... When driven they would suddenly stop, turn round\r\nand round, and keep throwing their heads up as if they had been hit\r\nunder the jaw.... Two out of nine died, and five others had to be\r\nleft at the camp.\"[109]\r\n\r\n  [109] _Plants Reputed Poisonous to Stock._ Bailey & Gordon,\r\n  Brisbane.\r\n\r\nIn other natural orders we find one or two dangerous plants amongst\r\na whole series of perfectly harmless or useful forms. The Oleander,\r\nin the Olive order, Corncockle (_Lychnis floscuculli_), in the Pink\r\norder, _Lactuca Scariola_ amongst _Compositæ_ and others are all\r\ncases in point. So also is the Yew amongst _Coniferæ_, etc.\r\n\r\nHow do animals recognize these particular plants as being dangerous\r\nwhilst all their allies are harmless? But the reader will answer that\r\nthey do not; it is well known that animals _are_ killed by eating\r\npoisonous plants, therefore poison cannot possibly be any protection\r\nagainst animals.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those interesting questions in which the suppression\r\nof apparently irrelevant details produces confusion.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, wild animals, or even domesticated animals in\r\nnearly a wild state, do _not_ eat the poisonous plants of the country\r\nin which they and their forefathers have been brought up--that is\r\nprovided that they are either adult or are accompanied by full-grown\r\nanimals. Almost every case of cattle-poisoning in Great Britain\r\noccurs when young calves, foals, or lambs are turned loose in the\r\nfields without any mature older head amongst them. Sometimes valuable\r\nstable-bred animals are lost, especially by eating yew-leaves, but\r\nthere are exceedingly few instances of full-grown cattle being\r\ncaught in such foolishness. When cattle, horses, or sheep are turned\r\nloose in a new country, plenty of cases do occur, and it is possible\r\nthat they might make mistakes with unknown foreign plants which had\r\nescaped into their pastures here.\r\n\r\nBut almost every case of poisoning, even of cattle, shows that it is\r\nyoung cattle who foolishly eat foxgloves, dropwort, buttercup, etc.,\r\nand occasionally die thereby.\r\n\r\nWild animals, who are of course brought up by their mothers, never\r\nseem to be poisoned. They probably recognize the dangerous plant\r\nby colour, smell, or taste. As a matter of fact, many are rendered\r\nconspicuous by some lurid sort of colour, such as bright red or\r\npurple. There is a general garishness of appearance about many of\r\nthem. Aconite, Foxglove, Herb Paris, Henbane, and Nightshades all\r\nshow this peculiar appearance. In Java it is said that the natives\r\nkeep away wild pigs by planting hedges of certain species with\r\npurplish-red leaves around their plantations.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting point of all is that it seems to be\r\nquite justifiable to conclude that animals do, somehow, manage to\r\ntell their offspring and each other what they should and should not\r\neat.\r\n\r\nYouth, with its tendency to rash experiment, is thus kept in check by\r\nthe mature experience of age.\r\n\r\nBut it must be admitted that it is exceedingly difficult to arrive at\r\nthe facts in any particular case.\r\n\r\nI shall be rash enough to give an opinion as to the actual facts\r\nin connexion with the common Yew (_Taxus baccata_). The seeds are\r\npoisonous to poultry and pheasants, but the fleshy part round the\r\nseed is eaten with impunity by many wild birds (blackbirds, etc.).\r\nThe leaves are sometimes poisonous and even fatal to horses, cattle,\r\nsheep, donkeys, and goats, but they are not eaten by or are harmless\r\nto roedeer. When, however, e.g., horses are killed by eating yew, it\r\nis generally found that they have been grazing on cut-off branches\r\nwhich have been left lying on the ground. In this condition probably\r\nsome specially poisonous substance is developed in them.\r\n\r\nAs regards rabbits, it would be extremely comforting to believe that\r\nthey would eat yew-leaves or anything else which would kill them,\r\nbut, so far as one can judge, they can eat all sorts of things which\r\nought to do so with perfect impunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nON FRUITS\r\n\r\n   Bright colours of fruits--Unripe fruits and their\r\n   effects--An intemperate Fungus--Oranges--Prickly pear and\r\n   the monkey--Strong seeds--Bill-of-fare of certain birds--A\r\n   wood-pigeon and beans--Ants and seeds--Bats, rats, bears,\r\n   and baboons--The rise in weight of a Big Gooseberry--Mr.\r\n   Gideon and the Wealthy Apple--Crossing fruits--Breadfruit and\r\n   banana--Dates--Figs--Olives--Pineapples by the acre--Apples and\r\n   pears--Home and Canadian orchards.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT Christmas time and during late autumn, there is but little colour\r\nin the country.

Sometimes it is\r\na spray of Hips (the fruit of the Rose), or it may be a cluster of\r\nHawthorn berries. At Christmas the Holly is positively gaudy with its\r\nbright scarlet fruit set off by the shining dark green leaves.\r\n\r\nMost fruits are some shade of red, but every fruit is conspicuous and\r\neasily seen.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Queensland Government Photo_\r\n\r\n  PINEAPPLES AS A FIELD CROP\r\n\r\n  This is one of the important harvests in some parts of\r\n  Queensland.]\r\n\r\nThere is the most extraordinary range in colour. The Snowberry and\r\nDwarf Cornel are pure white. The Mistletoe is a yellowish green.\r\nPure yellow fruits are not common, but some of the Cucumber orders\r\nand Lemons are lemon or orange-yellow. The bluish-black of the\r\nBlaeberry or Bilberry, of the Bramble, and of many Plums and Prunes,\r\ngoes along with a rather peculiar shade of green in the leaves which\r\nsets them off. The black Elder berries, on the other hand, have\r\nbright red or pink stalks which contrast prettily with them. The\r\ncolours of apples vary: many of them have been rendered a gorgeous,\r\nglossy red through cultivation. One of the most beautiful colour\r\ncontrasts in Nature is found in the rich black of the Olive, with its\r\nbackground of shining white twigs and silver-green leaves. Another\r\nvery curious harmony is that of the Spindle tree fruit, which has\r\na hard dull red case that opens to display the seeds: these are\r\nenclosed in a bright orange fleshy cup.\r\n\r\nChanges often occur. The Lily of the Valley fruit is at first green,\r\nthen becomes flecked with red, and finally is a rich scarlet. Juniper\r\nberries change from green to purple.\r\n\r\nNow there is always some meaning in Nature for any series of facts\r\nsuch as these. Why are these fruits so brightly coloured and so\r\nconspicuous?\r\n\r\nBirds and other animals are intended to scatter the fruits and\r\nseeds, and so the fruits must be easily distinguished at a distance.\r\nThe seeds are taken to some other place, where they germinate and\r\nform a new plant. This furnishes the clue and guide to many other\r\npeculiarities in fruits and seeds.\r\n\r\nThe pleasant smell of ripe apples, plums, strawberries, and other\r\nfruits, also attracts birds and other animals. But the sugary juice\r\nand delicious flesh is developed entirely for the purpose of making\r\nit worth a bird's while to eat it. The amount of sugary matter is\r\nenormous, and the seeds seem very small and inconspicuous compared\r\nwith this luscious mass. The sugar is produced very rapidly towards\r\nthe end of the ripening period.\r\n\r\nA Cucurbita fruit, for instance, may increase in weight at the rate\r\nof·0032 ounce per minute. All who have gathered strawberries know how\r\nquickly they ripen.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the sugar is formed is not understood, but unripe\r\nfruits contain bitter, unwholesome acids and essences which may\r\nproduce colic or very unpleasant effects if the fruits are eaten\r\ngreen. Thus the colour is a guide to the animal, who is not supposed\r\nto eat the fruit until it is ripe; if eaten green, the seeds inside\r\nthe fruit are quite destroyed and cannot germinate. Yet animals are\r\nso greedy that young birds, young animals of all sorts (even girls\r\nand boys) will and do eat green or half-ripe fruit. In this present\r\nyear there is no doubt that many children have suffered for having\r\ndone this. Yet if we come to think of it, throughout all the millions\r\nof years during which fruits have ripened, Nature has every year\r\nclearly told young pterodactyls and other lizards, young birds, young\r\nmonkeys, and young people to wait till the fruit is ripe. None of\r\nthem have learnt to do so.\r\n\r\nWhen investigating by experiment, on the vile body, the properties of\r\nplums, strawberries, and other fruits, you are sure to find here and\r\nthere one that has decayed and become rotten. In most cases this is\r\nbecause a bird has pecked a hole in it, or because the outside skin\r\nhas been broken by a wasp. The sugar has then begun to ferment. Why\r\ndoes it do so?\r\n\r\nIf you gather a few fruits, put them into a jar of sugar-water, and\r\nleave it after closing the mouth with a bunch of cotton wool, then\r\nin a day or two fermentation begins and alcohol is produced. That\r\nis because, on the outside of the fruit, there were hundreds of an\r\nobjectionable little fungus. It lives upon sugar and turns the latter\r\ninto alcohol. This yeast fungus is really a living distillery. It\r\nlives in the midst of alcohol all its life, dying eventually (like\r\nthe Duke of Clarence in his butt of Malmsey wine) by alcoholic\r\npoisoning, which it has brought about by its own work. This little\r\nyeast fungus can only be seen with a microscope. From a rotten fruit\r\nit drops on to the ground, where it remains all winter. Next spring\r\ncertain small insects (green-fly and the like) carry some of these\r\nyeasts from the earth to next year's fruits. But the skin of the plum\r\nor apple, or the hairs on a gooseberry, or the delicate, waxy bloom\r\non a grape, will prevent these insects or wasps from laying open the\r\nsugar inside the fruit to the attacks of yeasts and other fermenting\r\nfungi.\r\n\r\nSome fruits appear to have \"favourites\"; they seem to prefer that\r\nlarge animals should eat them. If you look carefully at a piece of\r\norange peel, and cut a small piece across, you will see distinctly\r\nsmall resin pits full of a curious essence which gives the\r\ncharacteristic taste to marmalade. This bitter stuff will prevent\r\nwasps from touching the sugar. It is, however, a valuable material,\r\nand some kinds of lemons, etc., are grown chiefly for this oil,\r\nwhich is obtained by scraping the peel with a little saucer which is\r\nstudded with short pins.\r\n\r\nA still more extraordinary fruit is the prickly pear; this is very\r\ndelicious though very difficult to eat. Indeed, only monkeys and man\r\nseem able to enjoy it. The sugary part and the seeds form a little\r\nround mass in the inside. The outside part, though also fleshy,\r\ncontains hundreds of minute mineral needles, which stick in the\r\ntongue and lips and cause most painful inflammation. The monkey eats\r\nthe prickly pear with very great caution, getting his fingers into\r\nthe top and scooping out the sugary part. Man requires a teaspoon to\r\ndo this satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nAnother very curious point about these fleshy fruits (and also\r\nordinary ones) is the strength of the seed inside. It does not look\r\nvery strong.\r\n\r\nBut an orange seed, for instance, will not be in the least injured\r\nif you put it between two glass plates and gradually press upon the\r\nupper one up to even a pressure of some thirty pounds. Even hemp\r\nseed, which seems quite weak, will endure a weight of four pounds. It\r\nis impossible to break a prune stone, or to injure a date stone, by\r\nstanding with your whole weight upon it.\r\n\r\nSuch strength is necessary because many of these seeds are eaten\r\nby birds and ground up in their crops with bits of china, stones,\r\nshells, and the like, which the birds pick up just to help them in\r\ncrushing their food.\r\n\r\nFruits and seeds would seem to be exposed to some danger when they\r\nare lying on the ground. Horses or other heavy animals might tread on\r\nthem. But the strength of seeds and their shape is such that no harm\r\nis likely to accrue. For instance, I arranged a thin layer of garden\r\nearth (a quarter of an inch thick) on a glass plate; upon the earth I\r\nplaced four hemp seeds; then I put a 58-lb. weight on the top of the\r\nseeds. They were not in the least injured, although the seed of the\r\nhemp is not a particularly tough one. Under such conditions the seed\r\nsimply slips into the earth.\r\n\r\nThis is made easy for it on account of its shape, which is generally\r\nrounded above and below. A transverse section of a seed would be in\r\nshape like the arch of a bridge and its shadow in the water, at least\r\nin many cases. There are also usually wonderfully thickened cells in\r\nthe shell or coat of a seed, which makes it tough and strong.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few cases of strong seeds or fruits:--Cotton seed\r\nbears a weight of 19 to 20 lb.; the hard fruits of the Dogrose,\r\n33 lb.; Castor-oil seed, 17 lb.; Hornbeam nuts, 27 lb.; Pine seed\r\n(various sorts), from 11 to 22 lb.; Yew seeds, 16 lb.; Peas, 50 to 56\r\nlb. In every case they are not at all hurt by these pressures.\r\n\r\nAs regards the animals for whom fruit or seeds are of great\r\nimportance, birds are of course the commonest. The following is part\r\nof the bill-of-fare of a few of our common birds:--Thrushes eat\r\nblaeberries (bilberries), brambles and mulberries. Missel-thrush (or\r\nmavis) is especially fond of the mistletoe.\r\n\r\nNow the berry of the mistletoe is exceedingly sticky and glutinous,\r\nand in the course of the bird's meal these sticky strings get on to\r\nthe bill and feathers, so that the mavis wipes its bill on the branch\r\nof a tree. When it does so the seed becomes attached to the branch,\r\nand is drawn close to the latter when the viscous matter dries up,\r\nand so takes root on the branch.\r\n\r\nNightingales and robins eat strawberries and elderberries; blackbirds\r\nare very fond of strawberries, gooseberries, and raspberries.\r\nWood-pigeons eat beechmast, acorns, and, according to Pliny,\r\nmistletoe-berries also, but this latter author has not been confirmed\r\nby later observers. Some of the wild African pigeons are exceedingly\r\nfond of castor-oil seeds. When travelling through the Central African\r\nbush, it is often necessary to shoot your dinner (if you are to have\r\nany at all), and castor-oil bushes can be relied upon to produce\r\npigeons, if you are content with and are able to shoot them.\r\n\r\nThere is a widely-spread belief in the country that a great quantity\r\nof berries means that a very severe winter is going to follow. But\r\nas a matter of fact the winter of 1904 was not a severe one, and yet\r\nthere were enormous quantities of berries.\r\n\r\nWe are still ignorant of many details about birds and berries. It is\r\nnot quite clear how the seeds are not destroyed, though experiments\r\nhave shown that they are not injured, by passing through the body\r\nof a bird. Kerner von Marilaun, for instance, tried the fruits and\r\nseeds of 250 different plants which were offered to seventeen birds,\r\nas well as to marmots, horses, cattle, and pigs. He found that from\r\nseventy-five to eighty-eight per cent. of the seeds germinated\r\nafterwards so far as regards the blackbird, song-thrush, rock-thrush,\r\nand robin. Quail also bring seeds from Greece and the Ionian Islands\r\nto Sicily.\r\n\r\nMr. Clement Reid says: \"Some years ago I found ... in an old\r\nchalk-pit the remains of a wood-pigeon which had met with some\r\naccident. Its crop was full of broad-beans, all of which were growing\r\nwell, though under ordinary circumstances they would have been\r\ndigested and destroyed.\"[110] Such accidents are common.\r\n\r\n  [110] Reid, _Origin of the British Flora_.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only birds which eat fleshy fruits and seeds. Even the\r\ntiny, industrious ant drags about seeds of certain plants. Sometimes\r\nthey gather up corn or grasses, such as ant-rice, and store them\r\nfor use in winter. They even bite off the growing root to prevent\r\nthe seeds germinating and spoiling. Occasionally they seem to carry\r\nthe seeds by accident, as, for example, those of the cow-wheat and\r\na few others which resemble their cocoons in size, colour, and\r\nform. In other cases there is a little fleshy excrescence on the\r\nseed which they are fond of eating. Cyclamen, snowdrop, violet, and\r\nperiwinkle seeds are supposed to be carried in this way. Many animals\r\noccasionally or regularly eat fruits. There are, for instance,\r\nthe flying-foxes or fruit-eating bats of Madagascar and tropical\r\ncountries, which may be seen hanging from the upper branches of\r\ntrees by their toes, with their heads tucked away under their wings.\r\nWhen disturbed a little fox-like head appears, and after much\r\nchattering, scolding, and expostulation, the creature unhooks itself\r\nand flies away with a strong flight not unlike that of a crow. Horses\r\nare occasionally fed on peaches in Chile. Rats eat the coffee cherry,\r\nand do a great deal of harm in coffee plantations.\r\n\r\nIn Cashmir the mulberry and other fruit trees are sometimes visited\r\nby sportsmen, who often find bears feeding on the fruits. Pigs, of\r\ncourse, eat all sorts of fruit, and several other mammals do the\r\nsame, but it is especially monkeys that live chiefly on fruit. They\r\nplunder the banana plantations, and in South Africa melon-patches\r\nrequire to be most carefully watched to prevent baboons from\r\ndestroying them.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the baboons watch the plantations from a distance,\r\nand will only come down if they think no one is there: so five people\r\nwalk to the patch, and while four go away again, one of them remains\r\nin hiding to shoot the baboons, who cannot tell the difference\r\nbetween four and five.\r\n\r\nMan himself is, and has always been, a great eater of fruit. Not only\r\nso, but he has enormously improved and altered wild fruits until\r\nthey are modified into monsters of the most extraordinary kind. The\r\nordinary wild gooseberry weighs about 5 dwt. But even in the year\r\n1786 some of the cultivated forms weighed double this amount (10\r\ndwt.), and in 1852 gooseberries which weighed more than 37 dwt. were\r\nin existence. What size the largest big gooseberry may be this year\r\nis not very easy to say, because the public Press is at slack times\r\ntoo energetic about the question. The most usual way of improving\r\nfruits is by selecting the finest specimens for reproduction. It is\r\nby this means that the original wild banana, which is a rather small\r\nfruit with very large seeds and very little flesh, has been altered\r\ninto something like 150 varieties, of which the immense majority\r\nhave no seed at all. This is a very extraordinary fact, because the\r\nseed is the reason for the existence of the fruit. Of course, all\r\nsuch varieties must be reproduced by suckers (like the banana) or by\r\ngrafts, or in some such non-sexual manner. Seedless varieties exist\r\nof the Cucumber, Fig, German Medlar, Diospyros, and Orange.\r\n\r\nIn the case of seedless varieties of the Vine, it has been found that\r\nit is necessary to carry pollen to the flowers to fertilize them, and\r\nthe seedless fruit is also very much smaller in this case, not more\r\nthan a quarter of the size of one that has seeds.\r\n\r\nThe following instance is typical of the manner in which many\r\nwell-known kinds of fruit have been developed, though the\r\nperseverance shown by Mr. Gideon is certainly not common. About the\r\nyear 1855 this gentleman began planting apple trees of about thirty\r\nnamed varieties. For nine years he continued his experiments. He not\r\nonly planted trees, but also sowed apple seed sufficient to produce\r\na thousand trees every year. Yet the cold winters were so severe\r\nthat at the end of ten years one small seedling crab apple was the\r\nsolitary survivor. One seedling of this turned out to be hardy enough\r\nfor the climate of Minnesota, and this, the \"wealthy\" apple, has been\r\nof great importance to the Northern Mississippi growers. It is to be\r\nhoped that the name has been justified in Mr. Gideon's case.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & Underwood_\r\n  _London & New York_\r\n\r\n  BANANA CARRIERS IN JAMAICA\r\n\r\n  A West Indian negro thinks nothing of walking twenty miles with\r\n  loads such as these.]\r\n\r\nMany other cases could be mentioned of a chance variety produced as a\r\nwild plant, and then propagated non-sexually for long periods, e.g.\r\nthe New Rochelle Bramble, which was found by the roadside, and\r\nwhich turned out to be exceedingly valuable. It is by crossing or\r\nhybridizing that the most extraordinary results have been obtained.\r\nSometimes with plums, the hybrids of the first generation are nearly\r\ndouble the size of their parents. Some of the crosses are between\r\ndifferent plants. The Loganberry, for instance, is said to be a cross\r\nbetween a Raspberry and a Bramble. It ripens in July, and is said to\r\nbe far in advance of either of its parents as regards juiciness and\r\nacidity.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, however, the crosses are between well-established\r\nvarieties or races of the same species, and both hybridizing and\r\nselection are employed to get the desired result.\r\n\r\nThere are several tropical fruits which, with the possible exception\r\nof wheat and oats, are more important to mankind than anything else.\r\nThe Breadfruit (_Artocarpus incisus_), which is very common in the\r\nSouth Sea Islands, has a large fruit the size of a melon. When baked\r\nin an oven heated by hot stones, it forms a satisfying meal: it is\r\nrather like new bread, but has very little flavour. Coarse cloth is\r\nmade of its bark, and the wood is used as timber. The tree also has\r\na milky juice containing indiarubber, and is employed for caulking\r\nthe canoes. The most interesting point for botanists about this plant\r\nis that the fruit is made up of thousands of little flowers, and the\r\nfleshy part is really the stalk. Fossil trees of this genus (of the\r\nchalk period) are found in some parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nStill more important to mankind is the Banana (_Musa paradisiaca_).\r\nIt is wheat, corn, and potatoes all in one, in tropical and\r\nsub-tropical countries. It is found all over the world wherever there\r\nis a hot, moist climate and shelter from wind. It is a most generous\r\nplant as regards the amount which it will produce. It will yield\r\nabout 19-1/2 tons of dry fruit on a single acre, which is about\r\nforty-four times the amount given by potatoes and 133 times that of\r\nwheat. Moreover, it differs from almost every other fruit in being\r\nboth \"rice and prunes,\" that is, it is nutritious and wholesome, and\r\nyet at the same time succulent. There are still people who declare\r\nthat the taste is that of \"cotton wool and Windsor soap,\" but that\r\nis a frivolous and unjust remark. It is very difficult to prepare\r\nit exactly in the right way for export to Great Britain, and the\r\nslightest change in temperature or period of gathering has the most\r\ndistressing results.\r\n\r\nAs with many other tropical fruits, the countries where it is most\r\ncarefully produced and where the trade is most important are just on\r\nthe borders of the tropics. There Europeans can keep enough vigour\r\nand vitality to supervise and watch over the labour of natives. It\r\nis in the Canary Islands, Queensland,[111] and Jamaica that the\r\ncultivation is most carefully looked after. The yield may be from\r\nfive hundred to a thousand bunches per acre, and the value of the\r\ntrade is enormous. A plantation is not very beautiful, because\r\nthe huge leaves break up into irregular, ragged pieces which look\r\nuntidy. The flowers are visited by the beautiful little honey-sucking\r\nsunbirds and humming-birds. Monkeys also are very fond of the fruit.\r\n\r\n  [111] Queensland in 1900 had 6215 acres, and produced 2,321,108\r\n  bunches of bananas.\r\n\r\nIn the tropics it grows everywhere, and with extremely little\r\ntrouble. It is a doubtful blessing to the negroes, for they get their\r\nfood so easily that they tend to become incorrigibly lazy. Jam,\r\nchampagne, brandy, and meal can be made from the banana. When this\r\nmeal can be prepared satisfactorily, it may partly replace wheat in\r\ntemperate countries. Besides this, the leaves are used for thatching,\r\nand the stalks which make the stem contain a valuable fibre which is\r\nused for string and rope.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt and all along the great deserts of Sahara and Asia the\r\ngraceful stately Date palm gives the favourite food of the people\r\n(see Chap. X.).\r\n\r\nThe Arabs grind up the stones to make food for camels, and sometimes\r\nferment the sap to make toddy. The trees are either male or female.\r\nThe Arabs knew that it was necessary to pollinate the female flowers\r\nwith male pollen long before the meaning of the process was realized\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Fig, a native of the Persian Gulf, is cultivated all along\r\nthe Mediterranean and in India, Australia, and California. It is\r\nsometimes fifteen to thirty feet high, and reaches a very great\r\nage. There is one at Finisterre said to be several centuries old.\r\nIt yields fruit worth about £14 an acre. The most interesting point\r\nabout the Fig is the way in which the Fig-wasp carries the pollen\r\n(see Chap. V.).\r\n\r\nOlives are also one of the most important and characteristic\r\nMediterranean trees. The crop in both Spain and Italy is worth\r\nabout £8,000,000 to £9,000,000 annually. In California it is also\r\nsuccessfully cultivated, and pays very well. The peculiar taste of\r\nthe dessert olive is obtained by soaking it in lime or potash, and\r\nthen in vinegar or salt.\r\n\r\nThe Pineapple is one of the most delicious fruits, and is interesting\r\nin every way. The little sharp spines on the edges of the leaves\r\nkeep animals off, and also make it a little difficult to harvest.\r\nThe workmen must wear leather trousers to prevent their being cut\r\nand torn by the leaves. In Queensland the pineapple is grown in big\r\nfields, and about ten thousand fruits (worth about one penny each)\r\ncan be got from a single acre. It is also grown in the West Indies,\r\nin India, and in other tropical countries. If you examine the horny\r\noutside skin of the fruit with a sharp penknife, you will find that\r\neach little piece of the mosaic is a flower in itself; with a little\r\ncare the bracts, three sepals, three petals, and six stamens can be\r\ndistinguished. The whole stem and all its flowers unite to make a\r\ncompound fruit. Most varieties have no seeds. It is a native of South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, our home fruits, Apples, Pears, Gooseberries,\r\nStrawberries, Raspberries, and Currants, that are most important\r\nto us in Britain. The Wild Crab Apple is found from Drontheim, in\r\nNorway, to the Caucasus, and grows over the whole of Europe. Apples\r\nwere known to the Greeks and Romans.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in our own climate there are great dangers in the\r\norchard. A touch of frost when the flowers are ripe will very likely\r\nkill the tender, green, baby apple. It is perhaps in Canada and\r\nNorth America that the growing of apples and pears is most carefully\r\nlooked after. Our beautiful old orchards in Devonshire and other\r\nplaces, with comfortable grass below the trees, and moss-covered,\r\npicturesque, ancient trunks, are not found in the New World. The\r\nregular lines of young trees in bare, carefully-kept earth, with\r\nevery stem whitewashed and treated with the most scientific monotony,\r\nproduce a most valuable return. But in this country those who are\r\ncareful and scientific sometimes obtain extraordinary results. It\r\nis on record that a man with a holding of twenty-nine acres near\r\nBirmingham made £600 a year from this small plot and paid £250 for\r\nlabour on it.[112]\r\n\r\n  [112] _Journal Royal Horticultural Society_, vol. 27, part iv.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone also said that the future of British farmers depended\r\nupon jam. Yet it must be remembered that the trees take a long time\r\nto come into bearing, and the crop is most uncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nWANDERING FRUITS AND SEEDS\r\n\r\n   Ships and stowaway seeds--Tidal drift--Sheep, broom, migrating\r\n   birds--Crows and acorns--Ice--Squirrels--Long flight of\r\n   birds--Seeds in mud--Martynia and lions--The wanderings\r\n   of Xanthium--Cocoanut and South Sea Islands--Sedges and\r\n   floods--Lichens of Arctic and Antarctic--Manna of Bible--The\r\n   Tumble weeds of America--Catapult and sling fruits--Cow\r\n   parsnips--Parachutes, shuttlecocks, and kites--Cotton--The use\r\n   of hairs and wings--Monkey's Dinner-bell--Sheep-killing grasses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ways in which fruits and seeds are scattered abroad over the face\r\nof the earth form one of the most fascinating chapters in the story\r\nof Plant Life.\r\n\r\nThere is an infinite number of ingenious contrivances, so many indeed\r\nthat it is not at all easy to explain them.\r\n\r\nHowever, suppose yourself seated on a grassy cliff near Eastbourne or\r\nBrighton.\r\n\r\nLooking lazily out over the blue waters, you see Norwegian timber\r\nships and steamers of all kinds, from the little coasting \"Puffing\r\nBilly\" to the huge liner departing for Australia or South Africa.\r\n\r\nPlants are probably using every steamer; in the straw of the packing\r\ncases, in the cargoes of corn or grain, in the ore, and in the\r\nballast, there are sure to be seeds. Such stowaways are mostly weeds,\r\nbut of course many valuable garden, farm, orchard, and forest seeds\r\nare being intentionally exported.\r\n\r\nLooking down on the seashore, you will notice the high-water mark,\r\na yellowish brown line of floated rubbish which is quite distinct\r\neven at a distance. If you now go down and examine it closely (not\r\na particularly pleasant operation, seeing that so much is in a\r\ndecomposing condition) you will find many seeds amongst the corks and\r\nbits of straw, seaweed, and objectionable, if lively, animalcula, and\r\nvery likely also pieces of plants, such as willow branches, which\r\nmight quite easily take root.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of Norway, and on our own western seaboard, the fruits\r\nof a West Indian bean (_Entada scandens_) are occasionally to be\r\nfound, and its seeds are probably able to germinate. We know that in\r\nlong-past geological ages they were floating round the estuary of the\r\nThames, where they occur as fossils. It has been found by experiment\r\nthat fruits and seeds are not killed although they have floated for a\r\nyear or more in salt water. Thus ocean currents are utilized to carry\r\nfruits and seeds.\r\n\r\nBut from our comfortable seat on the South Downs, still more can be\r\nlearnt of wandering seeds. The wind which blows across the downs\r\ncarries with it hundreds of winged or hairy fruits, all of them\r\nexquisitely fashioned as miniature airships, aeroplanes, or other\r\nwinged contrivances. The wind is an important distributer of seeds.\r\n\r\nOne of the South Down sheep is trailing behind it a piece of bramble\r\nwhich has caught in its wool; others, which have been grazing on the\r\nbroken cliff-edge where Agrimony, Forget-me-not, and Burdock are\r\nflourishing, are certain to have spiny or sticky fruits entangled\r\nin their wool. Animals therefore carry seeds in their wool or fur.\r\nIf it should happen to be a fine, sunny afternoon, and if there are\r\nany plants of Broom near by, it is quite likely that you may, every\r\nnow and then, hear a faint, sudden crack. This will be the Broom at\r\nwork scattering its seeds by itself. The little pod, when it dries,\r\ncontracts in such a way that it splits with a sudden explosive pop,\r\nand the seeds are sent flying to a distance of three or four feet.\r\nThis curious fact was observed in 1546 by the naturalist Boek. The\r\nWhin and many other plants act in the same way, for the dry fruit\r\nbecomes elastic and coils up spirally, flinging away the seed.\r\n\r\nBut here also, on the southern shore of England, we are at a main\r\nstation of arrival and departure for migrating birds. A Landrail or\r\nother marsh bird might be flushed in France, and might quite easily\r\ncross the Channel with French mud sticking to its plumage. In this\r\nmud, or in its crop, there may be seeds or fruits which will be left\r\nin an English pond. This method is probably a very important one,\r\nfor these plants growing in duck-haunted places are amongst the most\r\nwidely distributed of all.\r\n\r\nMr. Reid has a very interesting discussion on this point. The crow or\r\nrook could quite well cross the British Channel now. In the days when\r\nBritain was covered with ice and snow, the gap between the French and\r\nthe English shore was only half the present width. There was at that\r\ntime much flat land with oak forest bordering the French coast.\r\n\r\nMr. Reid shows that it is probable that rooks regularly carry about\r\nacorns in the cup, for he found seedling oaks associated with empty\r\nacorn husks, stabbed and torn in a peculiar way. \"On October 29th of\r\n1895, in the middle of an extensive field, bordered by an oak copse\r\nand scattered trees, I saw a flock of rooks feeding and passing\r\nsingly backwards and forwards to the oaks. On driving the birds away,\r\nand walking to the middle of the field I found hundreds of empty\r\nacorn husks and a number of half-eaten, pecked acorns.\"[113] So that\r\ncrows may have brought the acorns that colonized Britain with oak\r\nforest in the earliest historical period.\r\n\r\n  [113] Reid, _Origin of the British Flora_.\r\n\r\nAnother means of dispersal is not so obvious on the South Downs. In\r\nthe Arctic region a glacier breaks away at its tongue into icebergs,\r\nwhich float off and are stranded somewhere perhaps hundreds of miles\r\ndistant. Upon these icebergs are stones and soil and plants which\r\nmay be carried to a great distance from their original place. In the\r\nGlacial period or Great Ice Age, ice may have been an important help\r\nin distributing plants, but at present it is difficult to find a good\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it is clear that in order to carry plants to new\r\ncountries and new homes, everything that moves on the earth's surface\r\ncan be employed. Not only the wind, but ocean currents, river waters,\r\nicebergs, and floating ice are used. Migrating birds, mammals, and\r\nespecially the most restless and unsettled animal of all, viz. man,\r\nare at work consciously and deliberately, or unconsciously and\r\naccidentally, carrying the seeds to form new forest, grasslands, or\r\nharvests in other countries.\r\n\r\nThe subject is in truth so vast that it is difficult to select the\r\nmost interesting and important cases.\r\n\r\nThe way in which squirrels, rats, voles, and lemmings devour nuts and\r\nthe like often leads to the distribution of the fruit. A squirrel\r\nmay, like a human being, forget where its store was buried, or be\r\ndriven from the place. Then some of those forgotten nuts will grow\r\ninto trees.\r\n\r\nBirds are known to travel enormous distances. It is said that one\r\nlittle Arctic bird travels from Heligoland to Morocco in a single\r\nflight. It would not, at first sight, seem likely that seeds and\r\nfruits could be carried by birds; yet Darwin saw that this might\r\npossibly be the case. The mud and slime in which so many birds find\r\nthe small insects which they require is full of seeds. An Austrian\r\nbotanist, Kerner von Marilaun, examined the mud scraped from the\r\nbeaks, feathers, and legs of a number of wading and marsh-birds. He\r\nfound in it the seeds of no less than thirty-one different water\r\nand marsh plants (Grasses, Sedges, Toad-rush, etc.). This showed,\r\nas is very often the case, that Darwin was the first to discover a\r\nvery important point. It is also interesting to find that these ugly\r\nlittle freshwater mud and marsh plants are at home almost everywhere,\r\nfrom the Arctic circle to Tierra del Fuego and from Peru to Japan.\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary cases known of sticking fruits and spines\r\nare the Martynias and Harpagophytons of South Africa. The fruit is\r\ncovered by hooked claws, and becomes a regular pest wherever it\r\noccurs. Deer, antelopes, and other animals get their hoofs entangled\r\nin the fruit, and the wretched creatures have to limp about until the\r\nhard thorny fruit is trodden to pieces. Dr. Livingstone says that the\r\nfruit gets into the nostrils of grazing animals which cannot possibly\r\nremove it themselves, and so have to wait patiently till the herdsman\r\ncomes to take it out. According to Lord Avebury, lions may sometimes\r\nbe destroyed by these horrible fruits. When a lion is rolling on\r\nthe sand, the claws (an inch long) stick in his skin, and when the\r\nlion tries to tear it away with his teeth his mouth gets full of the\r\nfruits and he cannot eat, and perishes miserably of starvation.[114]\r\n\r\n  [114] Ludwig, _Biologie d. Pflanzen_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & Underwood_\r\n  _London & New York_\r\n\r\n  A COCOANUT GROVE IN CEYLON]\r\n\r\nSome of our common British fruits are most perfectly planned to stick\r\nor entangle themselves in the wool of sheep or in people's clothes.\r\nThese, such as the Goosegrass (Robin-run-the-Hedge), Burdock,\r\nForget-me-not, Sanicle, Avens, etc., have very often been described.\r\nIt is only necessary to examine one's clothes after a walk through\r\nrough, broken ground to discover some of them, and the ingenuity\r\nand neatness of their tiny hooks, harpoons, or prongs can then be\r\nrealized. We shall give one or two instances of some other spiny\r\nplants. There is, for instance, Xanthium, which is one of the Daisy\r\nflowers or Composites. Unlike most of this order, its little fruits\r\npossess no wind-hairs. The outside of the head of flowers is covered\r\nby strong curved little crooks. These get so entangled in wool or\r\nhair that they become a perfect pest to wool merchants. In 1814\r\nXanthium was unknown in the Crimea, but by 1856 it had covered the\r\nwhole of the peninsula. In 1828 the Russian cavalry horses brought it\r\non their manes and tails into Wallachia, from whence it travelled to\r\nServia. Servian pigs carried it into Hungary. In 1830 it was taken\r\nin wool to Vienna. By 1871 it had reached Paris and Edinburgh. In\r\n1860 Frauenfeld saw horses in Chile whose manes and tails were so\r\nfelted together with thousands of these fruits that the animals could\r\nscarcely walk. In Australia, where it first appeared in 1850, it has\r\ncaused a very serious loss to the wool merchants and squatters. The\r\nloss has been put at 50 per cent. by some authorities.[115]\r\n\r\n  [115] Ludwig, _l.c._, after Ihne, Frauenfeld, Shaw.\r\n\r\nWe have already alluded to the transference of fruits and seeds\r\nby ocean currents. In the _Challenger_ expedition, no less than\r\nninety-seven kinds of marine floating fruits were observed.\r\n\r\nAmongst these the most important is the Cocoanut. The nut sold in\r\nthis country is not the whole fruit, but only the inside shell.\r\nIn the natural state this is enclosed in a dense mass of fibres,\r\nwhich form the valuable \"coir\" used for brushmaking and a variety of\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe entire outside of the fruit is covered by a smooth white skin.\r\nThe whole fruit is about the size of a man's head, and is so light\r\nthat it floats easily in the water. It has in fact been carried by\r\nthe waves to uninhabited islands all over the South Seas. It is a\r\nvery great blessing to Polynesia, for a tree yields thirty to fifty\r\nnuts, and four of these nuts will furnish enough food for one day.\r\nCoprah and the oil extracted by boiling the inside are also valuable.\r\nSpirit or toddy can be made from the young buds. The leaves are used\r\nfor thatching and the trunk for timber.\r\n\r\nThere are other very curious palm fruits which are also carried by\r\nwater. Sir Joseph Hooker mentions the large, round fruits of Nipa, as\r\nbig as a cannon-ball, turned over by the paddles of the steamer in\r\nthe muddy waters at the Ganges mouth (_Himalayan Journal_).\r\n\r\nIn this country a search in the rubbish left by a spate or freshet\r\nalong a riverside is sure to furnish many floating fruits or seeds.\r\nMost of these are small and rather difficult to see. Perhaps the most\r\ninteresting are those of the Sedges. The real fruit is only about\r\none-sixteenth of an inch in size, but it is enclosed in a little sack\r\nor bag a quarter of an inch long and with a narrow opening, so that\r\nit floats quite easily. Many willow branches, pondweeds, hornweeds,\r\nand the like, are also found in the rubbish left by floods, and these\r\ncan often take root.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in the exquisite modifications of those fruits which\r\nare blown by the wind that we find the most beautiful contrivances\r\nof all. They are effective also. Seeds are often so small as to\r\nbe like dust particles, and such may be carried in the air to\r\nalmost incredible distances. That of _Goodyera repens_ weighs only\r\n1/200,000,000 of a pound, that of _Monotropa_, ·000,000,006 lb. It\r\nis no doubt by the wind that the spores of lichens are carried from\r\none mountain to another. On a map of the world the distance from the\r\nArctic to the Antarctic, between the North and South Poles, seems\r\nenormous. Moreover, the amount of water, desert, tropical forest,\r\nand cultivated land in this extent of country is very great. There\r\nare but few rocks on which lichens could manage to grow. And yet of\r\nthe Antarctic Lichens in the South Polar regions, and which are also\r\nEuropean species, more than 73 per cent. are found in the Arctic or\r\nNorth Polar regions.[116]\r\n\r\n  [116] Darbishire, _Trans. and Proc. of Bot. Soc. Edin._, vol. 23,\r\n  part 1.\r\n\r\nAn Arctic lichen spore probably travelled from Scandinavia to\r\nthe German and Swiss Alps, another journey took it to the Atlas\r\nMountains, thence to Abyssinia, again to Mount Kenia, and from there,\r\nsomehow, it wandered to the South Orkneys or King Edward VII Land.\r\n\r\nWhile talking of lichens, one must not forget the Manna of the Bible\r\n(_Lecanora esculenta_) and two other species, which form warted,\r\nwrinkled masses on rocks. It breaks off and may be carried away by\r\nthe wind, or in heavy rain it may be washed into depressions of the\r\nsoil, where a man can pick up 8 to 12 lb. in a day.\r\n\r\nIt \"is used as a substitute for corn in years of famine--being ground\r\nin the same way and baked into bread.... It is also remarkable that\r\nall the great so-called rains of manna, of which news has come from\r\nthe East to Europe, especially those of the years 1824, 1828, 1841,\r\n1846, 1863, and 1864, occurred at the beginning of the year, between\r\nJanuary and March, i.e. at the time of the heaviest rains.... The\r\ninhabitants of the district actually thought that the manna had\r\nfallen from heaven, and quite overlooked the fact that this vegetable\r\nstructure grew and developed (although only in isolated patches and\r\nprincipally as crusts on stones) in the immediate neighbourhood of\r\nthe spots where they collected it.\"[117]\r\n\r\n  [117] Kerner, _Natural History of Plants_, vol. 2.\r\n\r\nAmongst the wind-blown fruits and seeds there are cases in which\r\nentire plants are dragged out of the soil and hurried away by the\r\nwind, which rolls them over and over. They may be blown along for\r\ndays together. The seeds drop out by the way. In this country one\r\nrarely sees anything of the sort, but in the Prairies of North\r\nAmerica, when under cultivation, these tumble-weeds are a serious and\r\nexpensive pest. Sometimes the farmers dig trenches to catch them, or\r\nthey may put up fences against which the tumble-weeds become piled or\r\nheaped up until they blow over the top.\r\n\r\nIt is not very much use to give the names of these weeds, for they\r\nare mostly rare or not British species. Such tumble-weeds are\r\ngenerally nearly spherical in general form and have a short, rather\r\nweak, root which is easily torn out of the ground. In some grasses,\r\nsuch as \"Old Witch,\" a well-known pest of the United States, the\r\ngrass-stalk, with many flowers on it, is pulled out of its sheath and\r\nblown away.\r\n\r\nBut it is more usual for the fruits or seeds themselves to break\r\noff the parent plant, and to be carried away by the wind. To this\r\nend we find the most extraordinary changes. Although the flower may\r\ndroop from its stalk, the latter becomes upright and grows quite\r\na considerable length when the seed or fruit is dispatched on its\r\nwanderings. This will raise the fruit or seed as high as possible\r\nabove the surrounding grasses.\r\n\r\nThen in some cases the fruit opens to allow the seed to escape.\r\nSmall holes appear in it, or the fruit splits. As the dry, elastic,\r\nwithered stalk swings to and fro in the wind, the seeds are swung out\r\nof these openings, and starting with a certain momentum the wind will\r\ncarry them often to a surprising distance from their parents. In wet\r\nor rainy weather these holes or slits generally close together, and\r\nno seeds are sent forth on their travels. The little holes in the top\r\nof a poppy-head by which the seeds are swung out have little flaps,\r\nwhich close over and shut them up in wet weather.\r\n\r\nSome plants make a sort of catapult to sling or hurl their fruits.\r\nKerner von Marilaun was the first to describe some of these curious\r\narrangements. He had brought home some fruits of _Dorycnium\r\nherbaceum_ and laid them on his writing-table. \"Next day as I sat\r\nreading near the table, one of the seeds of the Dorycnium was\r\nsuddenly jerked with great violence into my face.\" Some of the\r\nneatest catapult fruits are those of _Teucrium flavum_. (There\r\nis a British species, the Woodsage, but it has not got the same\r\narrangement.) When the petals have fallen off, the four small fruits\r\nare left inside the cup-like sepals; the flower-stalk when dry is\r\nvery elastic, and if an animal touches the sepals it swings violently\r\nand shoots out one of the fruits. But that is by no means the whole\r\nof the process: there are hairs arranged spirally in the throat of\r\nthe sepals, and these give a spin or twirling motion like that of a\r\nrifle-bullet to the fruit. The fruit also flies out of the sepals in\r\na line of flight which is inclined at an angle of about forty-five\r\ndegrees to the horizon; at this angle, as is well known, the\r\ntrajectory or distance travelled will be the greatest possible.\r\n\r\nBut by far the best way to understand these questions is to try\r\nwith some common weeds in the country towards the end of summer or\r\nbeginning of autumn. If either the Cow Parsnip or wild Angelica,\r\nor Myrrhis, be gathered and kept till it is quite dry, then if you\r\ntake it by the stalk and swing it to the full extent of the arms\r\nthe fruits fly off to fifteen (or more) feet away. Every part is\r\nelastic--not only the main stalk, but the thin separate stalks of\r\nthe flowers and also the delicate piece by which each half-fruit is\r\nattached. The half-fruits themselves are also so made that they are\r\nof exactly the right shape to take a long flight.\r\n\r\nEver since the days of Icarus, one of the unsatisfied ambitions of\r\nmankind has been to fly like a bird, to \"soar into the empyrean,\" and\r\nto be no longer chained to the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nIt is a very curious study, that of the many and diverse inventions,\r\nalmost always useless and very often fatal, by which men have\r\nendeavoured to solve this problem. Every one of these can be\r\nparalleled amongst the many neat contrivances of wind-borne fruits\r\nand seeds. The principle of the \"parachute,\" which is more or less\r\nlike an umbrella, is found in both fruits and seeds. One of the\r\nmost beautiful is the Dandelion fruit, where a series of the most\r\nexquisite branched hairs springs from the top of the slender shaft\r\nwhich carries the little hard fruit. Most of the Composite or\r\nDandelion order have, however, more of the \"shuttlecock\" idea. There\r\nis a row or crown of stiff and spreading or feathery hairs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & _Underwood_\r\n  _London & New York_\r\n\r\n  COTTON-FIELDS IN GEORGIA, U.S.A.\r\n\r\n  Negroes picking the cotton harvest.]\r\n\r\nThe classical person above alluded to seems to have copied the\r\nbird's wing, sticking on feathers with wax, which of course melted\r\nin the sun with the usual result to the inventor of flying machines.\r\nMany seeds have regular wings which act like those of the bat or\r\nflying squirrel. One of the most exquisite of all is the seed\r\nof Bignonia. The Dahlia fruit has also a flying wing, and a great\r\nmany others might be mentioned. Major Baden-Powell experimented with\r\nkites, which were supposed to raise a man high enough in the air to\r\ntake observations of the enemy's movements. But a most exquisite\r\n\"kite\" is that of the Lime tree. The little fruit is hung from a\r\nbroad, flying bract, and as it very slowly sinks to the ground it\r\nsolemnly turns round and round. That is because the pressure of the\r\nair acts on the flat bract just as it does on an aeroplane, and\r\nforces it to revolve. So the fruit remains a long time in the air,\r\nand may be carried to nearly a hundred yards away from its parent\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nThe Traveller's Joy (_Clematis_) and the Cotton have their seeds\r\ncovered all over by many entangled hairs, which act like a piece of\r\nfluff, so that the wind blows the seed away.\r\n\r\nNo one has discovered the original wild Cotton plant. The robes of\r\nthe priests in Egyptian temples were made of it. It was introduced\r\ninto Spain by the Arabs when they invaded that country. When the\r\nSpaniards attacked the half-civilized Indian people of Central and\r\nSouth America, they found cotton was regularly cultivated there.\r\nIts history in England is rather interesting. In the days of Queen\r\nElizabeth the great English industry was the production of woollen\r\ncloth from Yorkshire sheep. A penalty of £20 was imposed, even as\r\nlate as 1720, on any person who imported or even wore cotton cloths.\r\nYet this was unable to stop the growth of the trade which, thanks to\r\nthe Flemings and Huguenots who took refuge from religious persecution\r\nin this country, eventually became our gigantic textile industry\r\nemploying millions of factory hands.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of these wings and hairs is at once seen if one\r\ncompares the time that a fruit or seed takes to fall through a given\r\nheight, first with its wings or hairs, and then after they have been\r\ncut off.\r\n\r\nAn Artichoke fruit, for instance, will take nearly eight seconds to\r\nreach the ground from a height of a few feet. But if you cut away its\r\nhairs, it will touch the ground in a little more than one second. A\r\nSycamore fruit of which the wing has been removed falls to the ground\r\nin about a quarter of the time that it takes when it has not been\r\ninjured, so that the wing helps it to fly to four times the distance\r\nthat it could reach if it had none. The Ash fruit also remains twice\r\nas long in the air as it would do if it had no wing; and so on.\r\n\r\nWe shall finish this chapter by describing two very extraordinary\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nThe Sandbox tree is a native of tropical America. The fruit, as\r\nlarge as an orange, consists of a number of rounded pieces, each\r\nwith a single seed inside. When ripe each piece splits off, making a\r\nnoise like the report of a pistol. The plant is sometimes called the\r\nMonkey's Dinner Bell. These pieces may be thrown to a distance of\r\nfifty-seven feet from the parent plant.\r\n\r\nEven more remarkable are the hygroscopic grasses. There are four\r\nof them, which are widely separated as regards distribution, for\r\none (_Stipa capillata_) lives in Russia, another (_Stipa spartea_)\r\nin North America, a third (_Aristida hygrometrica_) is found in\r\nQueensland (Australia), and the fourth (_Heteropogon contortus_)\r\nbelongs to New Caledonia.\r\n\r\nYet all these four grasses are said to kill sheep, and do so in a\r\nmanner that is almost identical. The mechanism is as follows.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is like that of most grasses, enclosed in a folded leaf,\r\nthe bract (or glume), which in these particular cases is produced\r\ninto a very long fine tapering hair or awn. This awn is sensitive to\r\nchanges in the _moisture_ of the air. It is strongly hygrometric:\r\nin wet weather it straightens itself, and it coils into corkscrew\r\nspirals in dry weather. The widened part of the base, which contains\r\nthe grain, tapers into a sharp, very hard point; upon this there are,\r\non the outside, many stiff hairs, which point backwards away from the\r\nsharp tip.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose this fruit to fall on the ground, the awn or tail is\r\nsure to be entangled in neighbouring grasses or herbs, but the hard\r\npoint will rest upon the ground. Every coil and twist made by the\r\nentangled awn or tail will push the point a little deeper into the\r\nearth, and the backward-pointing stiff hairs will prevent its being\r\npulled out of the soil.\r\n\r\nTherefore all these modified contrivances ensure that the seed will\r\nbury itself.\r\n\r\nBut supposing that one of these fruits falls upon a sheep's back.\r\nThen an exactly similar process will go on. The seed will be forced\r\nthrough the skin into the body of the sheep. In fact, if it should\r\nfall above any soft or vulnerable part of the animal, the sheep will\r\nvery likely be killed.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, sheep are said to be killed by these grasses in\r\nall those four countries, distant though they are from one another.\r\n\r\nWe have endeavoured in this chapter to give some faint notion of the\r\nhundreds and thousands of ingenious contrivances utilized by plants\r\nin order to ensure the dispersal and future prosperity of their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nEvery species is always trying to colonize new ground, to seek fresh\r\nfields and new pastures. Plants are not content to keep to the old\r\nhabitats, but every species tries to scatter its pioneers over\r\nall the neighbouring country, so that, as often happens, if it is\r\nexterminated or suppressed in one locality, new generations luxuriate\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nSTORY OF THE CROPS\r\n\r\n   Bloated and unhealthy plants--Oats of the Borderers, Norsemen,\r\n   and Danes--Wheat as a wild plant--Barley--Rye--Where was\r\n   the very first harvest?--Vine in the Caucasus--Indians\r\n   sowing corn--Early weeds--Where did weeds live before\r\n   cultivation?--Armies of weeds--Their cunning and\r\n   ingenuity--Gardeners' feats--The Ideal Bean--Diseased\r\n   pineapples--Raising beetroot and carrot--Story of the travels of\r\n   Sugar-cane--Indian Cupid--Beetroot and Napoleon.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand the amount of labour and toil that has\r\nbeen spent on farmlands and pastures, if one only considers England.\r\n\r\nIt is often impossible to discover one square mile still covered by\r\nthe natural wild plants. It is all under corn or arable, or rich\r\nartificial meadowland.\r\n\r\nBut from a Scotch hillside, as one looks down at the fertile valley\r\nbelow, one can see _first_ where the mosaic of hedges and dykes\r\nstops, _then_ where, after a narrow stretch of rough grass pasture,\r\nthe cultivation ends; finally, where, ridge after ridge, rolling,\r\nheathery moorland, without enclosures and without any sign of man's\r\nhandiwork, rises up to the highest peaks.\r\n\r\nThis fills one with a respect and reverence towards our forbears,\r\nwhich is increased by a study of corn, turnips, and potatoes.\r\n\r\nEvery one of these plants is a thoroughly unnatural, artificially\r\nbloated, and overfed sort of creature. Its constitution, as is usual\r\nwith those who habitually overeat themselves, is delicate and unsound.\r\n\r\nNo cultivated plant could exist for more than a season if man did not\r\nlook after it and protect it from its rivals and weeds. Moreover,\r\nthey are a curiously assorted lot.\r\n\r\nWheat probably came from Asia Minor, Swedes from Scandinavia,\r\nMangelwurzel from the Mediterranean, and Potatoes from Chile. Turnips\r\nand Carrots are indeed native Britishers, though the original wild\r\ncarrot or turnip would never be recognized as such by any ordinary\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nThe history of every one of them is interesting. The Oat is the\r\ntrue Teutonic and Scandinavian grain, which has more \"fibre\" than\r\nany other cereal. There is an interesting passage in Froissart's\r\n_Chronicles_ describing the commissariat of those hardy Scotch\r\nborderers who raided and ruined the northern English counties\r\nwhenever they felt inclined to do so.[118] They lived for the most\r\npart on the cattle of their enemies, but each man carried a small\r\nsack of oatmeal and a griddle, or iron plate, on which to make\r\noatcake. So that each man supported himself. His little rough pony\r\nalso was quite able to look after itself.\r\n\r\n  [118] Or whenever they could do so successfully. (_Publisher's\r\n  note._)\r\n\r\nThat hardy plant, the Oat (_Avena sativa_) can be cultivated as far\r\nnorth as 69.50° N. lat. It is a native of Siberia and Western Europe.\r\n\r\nIt was oatmeal that supported the Norsemen who conquered Normandy\r\nand England, and who even dominated the Mediterranean. The Swedes\r\nof Gustavus Adolphus and the Danes of Canute also lived mainly upon\r\noatmeal and porridge. It is true that in England oats are abandoned\r\nto the horses, but those horses are the best in the world. There\r\ncan, of course, be no question as to whether the Scotch or English\r\nare the best!\r\n\r\nThe history of Wheat is a very complicated one; there are a great\r\nnumber of varieties and sub-species, all closely allied to our\r\nordinary wheat, and difficult to distinguish from it. One variety\r\noccurs as a wild plant from Mesopotamia, near Ararat, over Servia,\r\nthe Crimea, and as far as Thessaly, where entire hills are covered\r\nby it. This grain seems to have been cultivated at Troy, for Dr.\r\nSchliemann has found it at Hissarlik. It was, however, in cultivation\r\nlong before the days of Achilles; it was grown by the Stone Age\r\npeople, who lived in the lake dwellings of Switzerland. Another kind,\r\n\"spelt\" wheat, seems to have been the mainstay in ancient Egypt, in\r\nGreece, and all through the Roman Empire. It is now very rare, though\r\nit is still grown in Spain and in other countries where the soil is\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nGrains of the true Wheat have been discovered in the Pyramids of\r\nEgypt, so that it also is very ancient. To-day Wheat extends to\r\nNorway (69° N. lat.), and may be grown up to 4400 feet on the\r\nAlps.[119] India, United States, Russia, the Argentine, Chile,\r\nAustralia, and many other countries, produce great crops of this\r\nuseful and nourishing food. Its fibre is 3 per cent., albuminous\r\nmatter 11-1/2 per cent., and carbo-hydrates 66·5 per cent. Oat has\r\n10 per cent. fibre, 11-1/2 per cent. albuminous, and 57 per cent.\r\ncarbo-hydrates.\r\n\r\n  [119] Hackel, _True Grasses_.\r\n\r\nOne guess as to the origin of Wheat is that the first-named\r\n(Mesopotamian sort) is the original wild plant. By cultivation in the\r\nrich alluvial valleys of Mesopotamia and Egypt, improved kinds were\r\nformed. These have eventually replaced both \"spelt\" wheat and the\r\nwild race, but could only do so when richly-cultivated fields were\r\nready for them. On poor soil and with bad cultivation, \"spelt\" is\r\nsaid to be even now the most profitable crop.\r\n\r\nWild Barley grows in Arabia and from Asia Minor to Baluchistan. It is\r\nvery important in the colder regions of Northern Europe, in Tibet,\r\nand in China, but with us \"John Barleycorn\" is chiefly used for\r\nbrewing.\r\n\r\nRye also comes from Asia Minor. It was not apparently known in Europe\r\nuntil the Bronze period, but is now \"the chief cereal of the German\r\nand Slavonic nations.\" The black rye-bread is familiar to all who\r\nhave travelled on the Continent. The straw is good fodder, and is\r\nused for making hats and for paper.[120]\r\n\r\n  [120] Hackel, _True Grasses_.\r\n\r\nA very interesting point on which, however, it is quite impossible\r\nto come to a definite decision, may be noticed here. We will suppose\r\nwhat is quite as likely as any other theory, viz. that man as a\r\ngardening creature first settled somewhere in the Euphrates or\r\nCaucasian valleys.\r\n\r\nWhat wild plants, then, would have been available for his experiments?\r\n\r\nThis particular region is an interesting and remarkable one. Most of\r\nour common British plants occur along the shore of the Black Sea to\r\nthe Caucasus (apple, pear, nut, turnip, cabbage, carrot, and others,\r\nare all probably to be found there). On the Babylonian side of the\r\nmountains, there is a warm sub-tropical climate in which almost every\r\nuseful plant can be grown. The desert also contains a few other\r\nvaluable plants.\r\n\r\nNear Ararat, Noah might have found rye, wheat, and barley growing\r\nwild. The Wild Vine also grows on the south of the Caucasus. \"It\r\ngrows there with the luxuriant wildness of a tropical creeper,\r\nclinging to tall trees and producing abundant fruit without\r\npruning or cultivation.\"[121] In that favoured district, the olive\r\nand the fig, the melon and cucumber, onions, garlic, and shallots,\r\nand other common garden and medicinal plants, can be found. Not far\r\naway is the native country of the camel, the ass, the horse, and most\r\nother domestic animals.\r\n\r\n  [121] De Candolle, _Origin of Cultivated Plants_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & Underwood_\r\n  _London & New York_\r\n\r\n  RICEFIELDS IN THE CEYLON HILLS\r\n\r\n  The buffaloes are puddling up the soil before the seed is\r\n  planted.]\r\n\r\nWere these hillsides of Ararat or thereabouts, the first place where\r\nman sowed and reaped a harvest?\r\n\r\nAt any rate, in those flat, fertile, alluvial plains of the\r\nEuphrates, and also in Egypt, the first great cities arose.\r\n\r\nBut even in the later Stone Age, which may have been about 58,000\r\nB.C., some of these Caucasian plants seem to have been in cultivation\r\nin Switzerland. Probably every subsequent invasion, first that of\r\nraces with bronze weapons, and then of others in the Iron Age,\r\nbrought with it new cultivated plants.\r\n\r\nThe Oat seems to be an exception to the rule, for, so far as one can\r\ngather, it was not a native of Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nThe first harvest was, however, in all probability, a very casual and\r\noccasional kind of thing.\r\n\r\nMason (_Origin of Inventions_, page 192) has described such a kind\r\nof cultivation which was in existence amongst the American Indians\r\nquite recently. \"A company of Cocopa or Mohave or Pima women set\r\nforth to a rich and favoured spot on the side of a cañon or rocky\r\nsteep. They are guarded by a sufficient number of men from capture\r\nor molestation. Each woman has a little bag of gourd seed, and when\r\nthe company reach their destination she proceeds to plant the seeds\r\none by one in a rich cranny or crevice where the roots may have\r\nopportunity to hold, the sun may shine in, and the vines with their\r\nfruit may swing down as from a trellis. The planters then go home\r\nand take no further notice of their vines until they return in the\r\nautumn to gather the gourds\" (E. Palmer).\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting point about the cultivation of those early\r\nsavage peoples who built up for themselves unhealthy but elaborate\r\nwooden dwellings in the Swiss lakes, in order to escape wild beasts\r\nand human beings who were even more dangerous and ferocious than they.\r\n\r\nWeeds occurred in those cornfields, cultivated by stone implements,\r\nsome 60,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nThe seed of an Italian weed had been introduced with their corn, and\r\nwas discovered in Switzerland!\r\n\r\nWeeds are an extremely interesting group. A proverb about the\r\nhardiness and multiplication of weeds can be discovered in almost\r\nevery language. \"Ill weeds grow apace,\" _Unkraut verbessert nicht_,\r\nand so on. They are very common. In fact weeds, wayside, and\r\nfreshwater plants, have by far the widest distribution of all. There\r\nare twenty-five species which can be found over at least half the\r\nentire land surface of the earth, and more than a hundred occupy a\r\nthird of it.[122]\r\n\r\n  [122] Drude, _Handbuch Pflanzengeographie_, p. 107.\r\n\r\nMoreover, many of our common weeds existed in Britain when the\r\nglaciers and ice melted away, and there were as yet no people able to\r\ncultivate the ground.\r\n\r\nThe Creeping Buttercup, Chickweed, Mint, Persicaria, Dock, and\r\nSheep's Sorrel had already colonized the country, before the Great\r\nIce Age came upon them, and at least fourteen weeds were here when\r\nthe first corn-raising savages landed in Britain.[123]\r\n\r\n  [123] Reid, _Origin of the British Flora_.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it is difficult to understand where and how they\r\nlived. One discovers a very few, however, if one botanizes very\r\ncarefully along the seashore, or on river banks where landslips have\r\noccurred, and in other such places where bare ground exists which is\r\nnot the result of cultivation.\r\n\r\nThere these weeds fulfil a very important and useful purpose. The\r\n\"red smear\" of a landslip is soon tinted green with Coltsfoot,\r\nChickweed and the like, and the bare earth, which was useless and\r\nsupported no green covering, is very soon made once more a part\r\nof the earth's fruitful field. In such places the weeds are soon\r\novercome and suppressed by the regular woods, grass, or thicket of\r\nthe district.\r\n\r\nIt is far otherwise in arable land, where man desires to keep the\r\nground bare in order to give his own domestic plants the best part of\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nLet us look for a little at what actually happens in an ordinary\r\ncornfield. It is not merely one generation of weeds, but whole\r\narmies, that the farmer has to contend with.\r\n\r\nWhen the young corn is growing up (1) the bright yellow Charlock\r\ngrows much more rapidly, and the whole cornfield is golden with it.\r\nThe Charlock grows to some eighteen inches high, flowers, and sets\r\nits seed before it is suppressed by the growth of the cornstalks,\r\nwhich, of course, may be three or four feet or more in height.\r\n\r\n(2) Another series of weeds, such as Spurrey, are growing in the\r\nshelter of the tall stalks, and their flowers are ripened and their\r\nseed scattered long before the corn is cut. (3) Another series, such\r\nas Polygonums, etc., become ripe and are about the length of the\r\ncorn, so that when it is cut and thrashed the seed of the Polygonum\r\naccompanies the grain and is probably sown with it. (4) Then there\r\nare such weeds as the False Oat grass, etc., which are taller than\r\nthe Oat, and whose seeds are blown off and scattered all over the\r\nfield before the harvest. One would think that those exhausted the\r\nseries, but far from it: the farmer cuts and carries the crop, and\r\nfor two or three days the ground is almost bare, but if you revisit\r\nthe field a week afterwards you can no longer see the ground. The\r\ncut-off yellow stalks of the corn are set off by a dark continuous\r\ngreen carpet of flourishing weeds. This last, (5) the \"waiting\r\ndivision\" of the weeds, remain quietly until the corn is removed and\r\nthen get through their flowering and seeding before the field is\r\nploughed up or covered by grass.\r\n\r\nNow if one thinks for a little over the cunning and ingenuity of\r\nthese proceedings, it is obvious that each single weed has somehow\r\nlearnt how to develop exactly at the right time. Those especially\r\nwhich are intended (by themselves) to form part of the seed mixtures\r\nmust flower exactly at the same time as the corn. As a matter of\r\nfact, most seed mixtures are often full of weeds. In a single pound\r\nof clover seed, no less than 14,400 foreign seeds, including those of\r\nforty-four different weeds, have been discovered.[124]\r\n\r\n  [124] _Report of the Botanical Department N.J. Agricultural\r\n  Experiment Station_, 1891.\r\n\r\nOthers scattered on the ground will probably be buried and remain\r\nfive to seven years below the surface, yet they are ready to come up\r\nflourishing as soon as they get a chance.\r\n\r\nHow has this been brought about? It is only since about 1780 to 1820\r\nthat our present system of farming has prevailed. In these 125 years,\r\nthese weeds have found out exactly how to establish themselves.\r\n\r\nThe explanation is probably a very simple one. Every weed which did\r\nnot bloom and seed exactly at the right time was killed and left no\r\nseed. This encouraged the others, who have gradually brought about\r\nthe neat little arrangements above described. A process of selection\r\nhas been at work. Those that would not modify their arrangements to\r\nsuit new methods of farming have been suppressed.\r\n\r\nBut it is in some of the cultivated plants themselves that one sees\r\nthe most extraordinary results of selection.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Cabbage is still to be found on sea-cliffs on the\r\nsouth-western coast of England, and the Wild Turnip occasionally\r\noccurs in fields. There is nothing particularly interesting or\r\nattractive about either of them.\r\n\r\nYet from the one has been produced cabbage, cauliflower, seakale,\r\nbrussels sprouts, broccoli, and kohlrabi; and the other has given the\r\nendless varieties of turnips. For the most part these extraordinary\r\nchanges have been brought about in a perfectly straightforward way,\r\nby just choosing the biggest and finest sorts for seed.\r\n\r\nSome of the feats performed by gardeners in this way are almost\r\nincredible. A United States seedsman evolved the idea of a perfect\r\nbean from his inner consciousness. It had a particular shape which he\r\ndescribed to a noted grower of beans. Two years later his ideal bean\r\nwas produced!\r\n\r\nThe growers of pineapples used to have a great deal of difficulty\r\non account of the pineapple cuttings becoming unhealthy. Sometimes\r\n63 per cent. were more or less diseased. Then certain growers began\r\nto carefully select disease-proof pineapples, and finally reduced\r\nthe percentage of diseased cuttings to four per cent. Another French\r\nobserver (M. Roujon) by continually selecting the smallest seeds, was\r\nable to obtain corn only eight inches high.\r\n\r\nBut by far the most interesting and important researches have\r\nbeen those dealing with roots and tubers. Several people have, in\r\nfact, done in a few years what it took primitive man centuries to\r\naccomplish.\r\n\r\nThus, in 1890, E. v. Proskowetz obtained some seeds of the wild\r\nSea-beetroot which is found on the south coast of France. By very\r\ncareful selection he was able in the year 1894 to get good beetroots\r\nquite like the ordinary cultivated ones. These were biennials\r\n(not annuals like the wild plant), and had a large percentage of\r\nsugar--16·99 per cent. This was by selection in good and fertile\r\nsoil.[125] Vilmorin also obtained quite good carrots in the fourth\r\ngeneration by cultivating the wild form in rich and good soil, and\r\nselecting the best.\r\n\r\n  [125] Perceval, _Agricultural Botany_.\r\n\r\nIn fact there are in natural wild plants great differences between\r\nindividuals, and when such plants are cultivated in good soil, where\r\nthey have far more to eat than they require, the result is that they\r\nproduce extraordinary and monstrous types.\r\n\r\nThese types are, however, more or less delicate, and are weak in\r\nconstitution and easily killed. To prevent such variations those who\r\nwish to keep a race of seed pure are careful to keep it growing on\r\npoor land.\r\n\r\nIn 1596 the Hyacinth (_Hyacinthus orientalis_) was introduced from\r\nthe Levant. In 1597 there were four varieties, and in 1629 eight\r\nkinds were known, but in 1768 two thousand forms of hyacinth were\r\nnamed and described.\r\n\r\nBesides selection, the method of hybridizing or crossing is often\r\nused in order to obtain new or valuable strains. Generally both\r\nhybridizing and crossing are employed. This method has long been\r\npractised. Bradley, in 1717, writes as follows: \"A curious person may\r\nby this knowledge produce much rare kinds of plants as have not yet\r\nbeen heard of\"; and, in fact, peaches, potatoes, plums, strawberries,\r\nand savoys have all been greatly improved by hybridizing and\r\nselection.[126] By crossing certain kinds of corn, such as the\r\nChinese Oat and the wild European Oat, varieties have been produced\r\nby Messrs. Garton which at the Highland and Agricultural Society's\r\ntrials produced 84, 87, and 99 bushels per acre, as compared with 58\r\nbushels yielded by the ordinary Scotch Oat.[127] With potatoes also\r\nastonishing results have been got.\r\n\r\n  [126] Masters, _Nature_, July, 1899.\r\n\r\n  [127] _Journal Farmers' Club_, February, 1900.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Queensland Government Photo_\r\n\r\n  SUGAR CANE IN QUEENSLAND\r\n\r\n  The cart is being loaded up to carry the canes to the factory,\r\n  where it will be crushed by the latest and most perfect\r\n  machinery.]\r\n\r\nOne single potato was sold for £50 not very long ago.\r\n\r\nThe Potato, like the Indian corn, tobacco, and a few other plants,\r\nis an inhabitant of the New World. Of other cultivated plants the\r\nnative country is not known. No one knows where, for instance,\r\nSugar-cane was first cultivated, but it has nine Sanskrit names, one\r\nof which, _khand_, is, or has probably at one time been familiar to\r\nus as sugar-candy. It was well-known when the Institutes of Manu were\r\nwritten, but that may have been somewhere between 2000 B.C. and A.D.\r\n20.\r\n\r\nOne of the Hindu Indian deities, Kámadeva, who corresponds to Cupid,\r\nthe God of Love, carries a bow made of sugar-cane, with a string\r\nwhich is composed of bees.\r\n\r\n    \"He bends the luscious cane and twists the string\r\n    With bees: how sweet! but ah! how keen their sting,\r\n    He with five flowerets tips the ruthless darts\r\n    Which through five senses pierce enraptured hearts.\"\r\n\r\nFrom India it seems to have been carried by Alexander the Great\r\nto Asia Minor, for it is mentioned by Herodotus. In the time of\r\nthe Crusades it was discovered in Syria, and the Venetians learned\r\nsomething about it when the Crusaders returned to Europe. The\r\nSpaniards introduced the Sugar-cane to the Canary Islands in 1470.\r\nThen the Dutch took it to Brazil, and when they were expelled from\r\nthat country by the Portuguese they transferred their canes to the\r\nWest Indian Islands. Our English islands, Barbados (1643) and Jamaica\r\n(1664), soon found the cultivation a very profitable undertaking.[128]\r\n\r\n  [128] For full details see Watts, _Economic Dictionary of\r\n  Products of India_; Muller, _Select Extra-tropical Plants_.\r\n\r\nThe variations in price of sugar became in process of time of a very\r\nserious nature. In the year 1329 it is said that in Scotland a pound\r\nof sugar was worth one ounce of standard silver. But from 1780 to\r\n1800 the price fell to 9d. The East Indian sugar began to compete\r\nwith that from the West Indies about this time, but this was very\r\nsoon crushed out by imposing a duty of £37 per cwt.\r\n\r\nThe West Indies were then very flourishing, but even before this the\r\nfatal word _beet-sugar_ had already been heard. It was nothing at\r\nfirst but an interesting experiment by Professor Marcgraf in a German\r\nlaboratory, who had extracted a little cane-sugar from beetroot in\r\n1747. But in 1801 the beet was already in cultivation. Napoleon saw\r\nEngland's monopoly of the cane and judiciously encouraged the beet.\r\nThe result of his far-seeing policy only became manifest a few years\r\nago, for then the West Indian Islands, which we conquered and guarded\r\nagainst Napoleon at such fearful expense of blood and treasure, were\r\nalmost worthless; Continental beet-sugar had ruined our colonial\r\nplanters and our home refineries. It is in fact a most curious and\r\ninteresting example of how a little judicious encouragement by a wise\r\nand far-seeing Government may destroy the profits of victory in a\r\nlong, glorious, but yet ruinous war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nPLANTS AND ANTS\r\n\r\n   Meaning of Plant Life--Captive and domesticated germs--Solomon's\r\n   observations denied by Buffon but confirmed by recent\r\n   writers--Ants as keepers and germinators of corn--Ant\r\n   fields--Ants growing mushrooms--Leaf-cutting ants--Plants\r\n   which are guarded by insects--The African bush--Ants boarded\r\n   by Acacias and by Imbauba trees--Ants kept in China and\r\n   Italy--Cockchafer _v._ ant--Scale insects--A fungus which\r\n   catches worms.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world of plants supports all animal life, from the mite to the\r\nelephant. There are most intricate relations between one form of life\r\nand another. Thus a Rose tree attacked by an aphis or green-fly may\r\nbe succoured by the slim ichneumon, or other thin-waisted fly, which\r\nlays its egg in that of the aphis. Another insect, say a spider,\r\ncatches the ichneumon. A starling may eat the spider, and be itself\r\neaten by an owl.\r\n\r\nSo that ichneumon and starling are friends to the Rose, whilst the\r\nother insect, the spider, and the owl are enemies. Yet both the\r\nstarling and the spider are probably, almost certainly on the whole,\r\nfriends of the Rose, although they are unfriendly in this special\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nWith all other similar series or changes the final term is either a\r\nbird or animal of prey or mankind.\r\n\r\nUntil we introduce the idea of man as the culminating point of the\r\nseries, the whole of it seems to be without any special meaning or\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nBut when we think of how man utilizes the work of plants and animals,\r\nthen the whole scheme becomes intelligible and complete; it is like a\r\nwell-rounded story with a worthy and adequate end.\r\n\r\nMoreover, what man has done so far is only an instalment of what he\r\nwill probably succeed in doing. All who have brought up caterpillars\r\nor bees know that their greatest difficulty arises from certain\r\nminute insects or fungus enemies. We already know enough about these\r\nlatter to fight them with some chance of success, but there are\r\nhundreds of other spores and germs floating in the atmosphere, and\r\ncoming to rest on animals, on clothing, or on the leaves or petals\r\nof plants. These germs are now just as wild as, and infinitely more\r\ndangerous than the furious aurochs, the disdainful wild asses, or the\r\nferocious wolves that our forefathers succeeded in domesticating.\r\n\r\nThose bacteria, or germs, for instance, which are only one-thousandth\r\nof a millimetre long, are only visible by the help of a microscope.\r\nA row of three hundred thousand of them would be required to make\r\nan inch in length! Yet one of these germs can be mature and divide\r\ninto two new germs in twenty minutes. In forty minutes there would be\r\nfour, in an hour eight, and so on. The number after twenty-four hours\r\nis almost incredible.\r\n\r\nThese little germs stick to our clothes, fingers, lips, money,\r\nnewspapers, and anything that is often handled. They hover in the\r\nair we breathe, permeate the food we eat, and inhabit water, and\r\nespecially milk, in enormous numbers. Some of them are deadly. One\r\nmight easily decimate a whole population, as indeed happened in the\r\nSouth Sea Islands when smallpox was introduced. Others are harmless\r\nand even necessary.\r\n\r\nBut to-day if you go into a bacteriological laboratory you will find\r\nhundreds and thousands of little glass tubes all neatly labelled and\r\nstoppered with cotton wool. If you read those labels you will see\r\nthat the bacteria of all sorts of horrible and loathsome diseases\r\nhave been captured and imprisoned. There is the deadly anthrax\r\nbacillus peacefully discolouring gelatine; in another, possibly\r\nthe germs of hydrophobia may be undergoing a process of taming or\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nEach of these colonies of germs is under perfect control, and in\r\nmany of them their natural wickedness has been so much alleviated\r\nthat they are now useful aids to the doctor, who gives his patient a\r\nmild dose of the disease in order to accustom his system to resist\r\naccidental infection by the original type.\r\n\r\nYet what has been done already is only an earnest of what will no\r\ndoubt be accomplished. Every farmer and ploughboy will in time sow\r\nhis own bacteria; every dairymaid will make all sorts of cheese, from\r\nCamembert, Rochfort, to Gorgonzola, by sowing the right kind of germ\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nMan will no doubt cultivate the whole earth in the way that he now\r\ncultivates Europe and Great Britain, and will obtain mastery not only\r\nover his domesticated plants and animals, but over fungi, bacteria,\r\nand insects also.\r\n\r\nEven if man had never risen above the state of the Banderlog of Mr.\r\nKipling, there are other animals which cultivate and even combine\r\ntogether for warfare and conquest. In some respects they are better\r\ndisciplined even than man himself, and they can defy all sorts of\r\nmankind except civilized man.\r\n\r\nPossibly if man had not arisen on the scene, these insects might\r\nhave developed some sort of civilization like that imagined by Mr.\r\nWells in his story of the moon. We are only concerned with the\r\nrelations of these ants to plants. Those who are interested in their\r\nconquests and civilization must consult the excellent account by Mr.\r\nSelous in his _Romance of the Insect World_.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting points about them are as follows. They gather\r\na harvest and store it up for the winter. This habit of the ant was\r\nwell known to the ancients, and is mentioned by Solomon. At the\r\ntime of the French Encyclopædists, when the fashion of the times\r\nwas all for destruction and disbelief, the fact that ants do so\r\nwas ridiculed and flatly contradicted, and especially by the great\r\nnaturalist Buffon. They pointed out that ants hibernated during the\r\ncold weather, and therefore required no food for the winter, so that\r\nSolomon's story was absolutely ridiculous.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a hundred years people forgot that Palestine and those\r\nother countries where the habits of ants had been reverently observed\r\npossessed a climate much too warm and mild to make the ants hibernate.\r\n\r\nAfter careful study it has been discovered that the ants thoroughly\r\nunderstand the first stages of brewing!\r\n\r\nThe corn which they gather is not eaten by them in its hard winter\r\ncondition. When taken into the winter nest of the ants this corn\r\nwould very soon germinate and grow into a plant, but the ants manage\r\nto prevent this by some method which is not yet understood. If such a\r\nnest is left alone by the ants, the corn immediately begins to grow,\r\nbut it is not allowed to do so till it is required for food. Should\r\nthe store of corn get damp by heavy rain, or mould appear upon it,\r\nthen the careful ants bring up their store into the sunlight and dry\r\nit there.\r\n\r\nWhen it is required for food germination is permitted, but is soon\r\nstopped: the ants nibble off the growing rootlet of the seed. Then\r\nwhen the grain absorbs water and begins to change its starch into\r\nsugar, the ants suck in the sugar and reap the reward of all this\r\nlabour and skill.\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of this germination of the grain they are, of course,\r\nfar in advance of all the savage races of mankind.\r\n\r\nThere are certain South American species which go at least one step\r\nfarther. They have their own fields--spaces three or four feet in\r\ndiameter--which are entirely occupied by one single grass, the\r\nso-called Ant-rice (_Aristida stricta_). Dr. Lincecum states that the\r\nants \"work\" these plantations very carefully, removing every weed or\r\nother plant that comes up, and sowing every year the new seed at the\r\nproper season.[129]\r\n\r\n  [129] _Proceedings Linnean Society_, 1861. Dr. MacCook adds\r\n  nothing essential, and in no way disproves Dr. Lincecum's\r\n  statements.\r\n\r\nThese facts are sufficiently strange and startling, but there are\r\neven, apparently, species still more intelligent, who not only sow\r\nand reap, but actually prepare a soil and reap a crop of mushrooms,\r\nor at least, if not of mushrooms, of fungi. These wonderful little\r\ninsects gather leaves and cut them into fragments of an appropriate\r\nsize; they are then collected together so as to form a bed, and the\r\nfungus is introduced to this. The fungus is kept at a certain stage\r\nof growth by very careful treatment; the fruit-bearing ends are\r\nnibbled off, so that the young shoots come up indefinitely. The ants\r\nfeed upon these fungus shoots, and get a crop indefinitely prolonged.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, a system of agriculture far beyond that employed\r\nby any tribe of savages. Only man in a relatively advanced stage of\r\nagriculture grows mushrooms for himself. These facts, startling as\r\nthey may seem, are apparently quite well authenticated and have not\r\nbeen seriously questioned.\r\n\r\nThere are a great number of leaf-cutting ants who are, indeed,\r\namongst the most dangerous of the many insect pests in South America\r\nand elsewhere. Wallace (_Revue Scientifique_, 179, p. 29), in\r\nspeaking of the Saauba or leaf-cutters, describes how he placed a\r\nlarge heavy branch across the route of one of their columns.\r\n\r\nThe long line of laden ants was checked, and the greatest confusion\r\nset in at the head of the column. Each ant, for several feet down the\r\ncolumn, then laid down its leaf, and all set to work to tunnel under\r\nthe obstacle. This was managed in about half an hour's time, and the\r\ncolumn then proceeded on its way.\r\n\r\nAmongst other interesting and curious facts connected with these\r\nextraordinary insects is that some kinds are actually kept up by\r\ncertain plants as a sort of standing army or police.\r\n\r\nThere are no less than 3030 species of plant which keep these\r\nstanding armies of ferocious ants, or if they do not keep them, at\r\nany rate lay themselves out to attract them. The kinds which are\r\nattracted live upon sugar, and are strong, active, and extremely\r\ngood fighters. When travelling through the bush in Africa, it is not\r\nunusual in some places to touch inadvertently one of these protected\r\ntrees. In a moment one's hand and arm are covered by ants whose heads\r\nare dug deep down into the skin, biting with all their strength.\r\n\r\nIt is of course impossible to describe all the plants which protect\r\nthemselves against injurious insects and even large animals in this\r\nway, but two of them must be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThere are certain Acacias which are particularly interesting. Like\r\nmost of this order, they have large hollow spines instead of\r\nstipules at the base of the leaf. It is inside these spines that the\r\ntroops of the police-insects live. These Acacias (Oxhorn Acacia,\r\nas well as _A. sphærocephala_ and _A. spadicigera_) also produce\r\n_sugar_, which is secreted by peculiar gland-like organs on the\r\nstalks of the leaves, and even _albuminoids_, for at the tips of the\r\nleaflets there are peculiar little bodies which contain albuminous\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe Imbauba tree (_Cecropia spp._) also possesses a standing army of\r\nthese ants. It puts them up in the hollow pith in the centre of the\r\ntree, which is divided into large roomy spaces and makes a convenient\r\nnest. There is a minute opening by which they run in and out. On one\r\noccasion a naturalist found that the ants had been benumbed by a\r\nperiod of very cold weather, and in consequence had neglected their\r\nduty, and the trees had been stripped of their leaves by leaf-cutting\r\nkinds.[130]\r\n\r\n  [130] Belt, _Naturalist in Nicaragua_.\r\n\r\nThese last mentioned, the leaf-cutting ants, are especially dreaded\r\nby owners of plantations. Foreign or introduced plants are not\r\nspecially guarded against their ravages by special secretions, as\r\nis the case with the native flora, so that the coffee and cocoa\r\nplantations are often severely injured. In some places man has copied\r\nthose Acacias and Imbaubas, for in the orange plantations of the\r\nprovince of Canton, in China, ants' nests are collected and placed on\r\nthe trees. Moreover, the different trees are connected together by\r\nbamboos, so that the ants can easily pass, as on a bridge, from one\r\ntree to another.\r\n\r\nNear Mantua, in Italy, the same system seems to be adopted, and\r\nants' nests are carefully placed near the fruit trees. Their use\r\ncan be quite well understood, for Forel, in his work on the Ants of\r\nSwitzerland, estimates that _one ants'_ _nest will require_ a supply\r\nof 100,000 insects a day during the season.\r\n\r\nIt is quite common to find ants crawling about on the outside of the\r\nlarge heads of the Garden Centaury and a few other Composites. If one\r\nlooks carefully, one finds that there are streaks of honey to be seen\r\ncoming from the scales. The honey is not produced in the flowers,\r\nand seems at first sight to be of no use at all so far as the plant\r\nis concerned, but that is very far from being the case. Here comes\r\na cockchafer or other destructive beetle, intent on absolutely\r\ndevouring and destroying the young flowers. At once the pugnacity and\r\nwrath of the ants are aroused. They take up a menacing and ferocious\r\nattitude, and the cockchafer passes to some other plant.[131]\r\n\r\n  [131] Kerner, _l.c._, vol. 2, fig. 264, p. 242.\r\n\r\nSuch honey-glands found on the leaves and not connected in any way\r\nwith the flowers, are more common than one would think. Even the\r\ncommon Bracken produces curious honey-secreting hairs when it is in a\r\nyoung condition. These attract ants which drive away caterpillars and\r\nother dangerous insect foes.\r\n\r\nMany very dangerous insects are too small for birds, and can only be\r\ndealt with effectually by insects or fungi. Of these perhaps the most\r\ndangerous are the \"scale\" insects. The best-known one is very like a\r\nminute mussel shell. It is about one-quarter to one-third of an inch\r\nlong, and can be sometimes found in quantities on apples; they are\r\ngenerally collected round the stalk. The mother insect has this scaly\r\nback, and lies down and dies on the top of her eggs, so that her\r\nscaly corpse forms a roof and a shield for her young ones. Like all\r\npests of this sort, these creatures increase very rapidly.\r\n\r\nA certain scale insect was doing an immense amount of harm in the\r\norange plantations of Fiji, but it was destroyed by the introduction\r\nof lady-birds, and of a certain parasitic fly. It is said that these\r\ninsects destroyed the \"scale\" in six months!\r\n\r\nExperiments have also been tried with fungi. There are certain fungi\r\nwhich attack the bodies of living insects. So far, however, it cannot\r\nbe said that the results have been at all satisfactory, for the\r\npropagation and infection of the living insects by fungus spores is\r\nnot at all easy. There is also a certain feeling of doubt as to what\r\nmay happen. Those fungi, and particularly bacteria, might set up\r\ndangerous epidemics.\r\n\r\nDecaying meal contains hundreds of certain very curious worms called\r\n_Nematodes_. They are short, about one-twenty-fifth of an inch in\r\nlength, and are smooth and very like minute eels. These creatures\r\nare very active, wriggling or swaying to and fro in a characteristic\r\nmanner. Now in decaying meal there is a peculiar fungus. Like most\r\nfungi, it consists of very minute transparent threads which contain\r\nliving matter or protoplasm. This particular fungus has branches,\r\nbut also forms curious loops or belts. When one of these eel-worms\r\nis swaying about in the meal, it may quite well happen that its tail\r\nslips into one of these loops. If that happens, the fate of the worm\r\nis sealed, for the loop is elastic, and the more it wriggles the\r\nfarther it slips in and the stronger it is held. The fungus then\r\nbegins to grow, and forms a tube which grows _into the worm_ and\r\nkills it. All the material in the worm's body goes to nourish the\r\nfungus. This extraordinary fungus has been described and figured by\r\nProfessor Zopf, but seems to be a very unusual and rare form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE PERIL OF INSECTS\r\n\r\n   The Phylloxera--French sport--Life history of the\r\n   Phylloxera--Cockchafer grubs--Wireworm--The misunderstood\r\n   crows--Dangerous sucklings of greenflies--\"Sweat of heaven\"\r\n   and \"Saliva of the stars\"--A parasite of a parasite of a\r\n   parasite--Buds--The apple-blossom weevil--Apple-sucker--The\r\n   codlin moth and the ripening apple--The pear midge--A careless\r\n   naturalist and his present of rare eggs--Leaf-miners--Birds\r\n   without a stain upon their characters--Birds and\r\n   man--Moats--Dust and mites--The homes of the mites--Buds, insect\r\n   eggs, and parent birds flourishing together.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difficulty in describing the Romance of Plant Life does not arise\r\nfrom a want of romance, but the sieges, battles, and alarms are so\r\ndifficult to see, and the enemies are so tiny, that the terrific\r\ncontests continually going on escape our notice altogether.\r\n\r\nWhen one does look carefully and closely at the life of a plant, one\r\nsometimes wonders how it manages to exist at all in the midst of so\r\nmany and great dangers.\r\n\r\nThere are great swarms of insects which devour or burrow into it, or\r\nsuck its life-juices. These are infinitely more dangerous than the\r\nrelatively clumsy, heavy-footed, grazing animal.\r\n\r\nEvery part of a plant has its own special insect foe, and it is\r\nreally difficult to understand how it can possibly escape.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the \"Achilles' heel\" is the root, for, underground, plants\r\nget no help from the watchful and ever-present army of birds, who\r\nare, as we shall see, the natural police of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Phylloxera, for instance, which ruined the old and valuable\r\nvineyards in France, is a terrible little acarid, or mite, which\r\nattacks the roots. Too small to see, and impossible to kill without\r\nkilling the plant, it laid waste the fertile hills and valleys of\r\nall South and Central France, causing millions of pounds damage.\r\nOne reason for this destruction sprang from the universal sporting\r\ninstinct innate in every Frenchman. Everybody goes out with his gun\r\nto destroy any lark, sparrow, or titmouse that is idiotic enough to\r\nremain in the country. Only birds can deal efficiently with insect\r\npests. Take this horrible little Phylloxera, for instance; a single\r\nfemale in her life of forty-five days will lay about two hundred\r\neggs. Each egg becomes a little grub, which after a few moments of\r\nuncertainty and agitation settles itself, and begins to suck steadily\r\nat any unoccupied part of the vine root. After ten to twelve days'\r\nlife it will be laying eggs as rapidly as its mother. Thus in an\r\nordinary summer the number of young ones produced from a single\r\nfemale becomes quite incalculable.\r\n\r\nThese pests are natives of America. Imported on American roots about\r\n1868, they had in thirteen years practically ruined the vineyards in\r\nFrance, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Germany.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of remedies were tried--saturation of the ground by\r\npoisons, flooding the vineyards to drown them, artificial cultivation\r\nof their insect and plant enemies, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe correct and satisfactory method has been at last discovered.\r\nAmerican vines of sorts which are able to resist these Yankee mites\r\nhave been imported, and the valuable French vines have been grafted\r\non to them.\r\n\r\nAnother very dangerous root-enemy, which is common in this country,\r\nis the Cockchafer grub or Whitegrub. (But it is not nearly so bad as\r\nin France, where in the summer of 1889, a single farmer collected\r\n2000 lb. of Cockchafers.) The grub (each female lays seventy eggs)\r\nburrows into the earth, and for no less than three summers remains\r\nbelow ground devouring indiscriminately the roots of everything\r\nhe can discover. Underground, the mole is almost his only enemy,\r\nbut the rooks, starlings, and gulls, which follow the plough, are\r\nwatching for him. The Wireworm, Clickbeetle, or Skipjack, is also an\r\nunderground demon which lives for three years, and gnaws and worries\r\nat plant roots for the whole of that time. It, however, shows itself\r\nabove the surface.\r\n\r\nA gentleman who had passed his whole life in the country complained,\r\nin my presence, of the damage done by rooks. He had had six thousand\r\nof them shot that summer, and remarked that he had seen with his own\r\neyes one of them pulling out a young cabbage plant by the root. Of\r\ncourse it was quite unnecessary to point out that the poor bird was\r\nmerely trying to get at the wireworms and devour them!\r\n\r\nFor some time I used to look out for great attacks of wireworm in\r\nturnip-fields: when one was recorded, I never failed to find that the\r\ncrows had been ruthlessly shot down a season or two before.\r\n\r\nAll these, and many other insects, attack the roots, which would be,\r\none would suppose, quite well protected in the depths of the earth.\r\nTherefore we find roots producing all sorts of poisonous substances,\r\ntannins, and even strong-smelling bodies, which keep off these pests.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps the sucking battalions of the insect army which do the\r\nmost harm. In themselves they are weak, stupid, and scarcely move\r\nfrom their birthplace. They live out their life wherever their long,\r\nlancet-like proboscis needles have pierced the plant's skin, but it\r\nis their power of multiplication that makes them really formidable.\r\n\r\nHuxley calculated that if all the offspring of one \"green-fly\" lived,\r\nand if their broods also lived for ten generations, then the tenth\r\nbrood of that original green-fly would contain more animal matter\r\nthan the entire population of China. Green-fly would, as a matter of\r\nfact, go on increasing at this rate, were it not for the enormous\r\nnumber of enemies that prey upon them. A mathematical friend of Mr.\r\nBuckton calculated that in 300 days the produce of a single green-fly\r\nmight be 210^15, that is 210 multiplied by 210, and then again by 210\r\nup to 15 times!\r\n\r\nIn summer time one may often notice, especially on sycamores and lime\r\ntrees, a peculiar shining, sticky, honey-like substance which covers\r\nthe leaves. It is often so abundant as to drip like a rain of honey\r\nfrom the upper branches.\r\n\r\nThis \"honey-dew\" was a puzzle which greatly intrigued learned minds\r\nin the ancient world. Pliny speaks of it as the \"sweat of heaven\" or\r\n\"saliva of the stars.\"\r\n\r\nIn reality, however, it is nothing but the excretions of hundreds\r\nof millions of these green-fly or aphides, which will be found\r\nestablished on the under side of the leaves, where, moored by their\r\nlittle anchoring talons and with their proboscis inserted in the\r\nfresh green leaf, they are sucking hard and steadily at the sugary\r\njuice. In twenty-four hours it was observed that a single individual\r\ngave forth forty-eight minute drops of honey.\r\n\r\nBees are very often tempted to collect this honey so abundantly\r\nproduced, but this turns their own honey black, and may even make it\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\nPlants try to protect themselves against these pests chiefly by means\r\nof sticky or long hairs, by a thick skin, or by unpleasant tasting\r\nor smelling substances. But it is to insects such as lady-birds\r\nand others which devour the green-fly that they owe a deep debt of\r\ngratitude. In particular, there are certain parasitic insects which\r\nlay their eggs in their bodies. Not only so, but it is known that the\r\neggs of some other insects are laid _in the egg of the green-fly_,\r\nand in one instance it has been found that yet another insect laid\r\nits egg in the egg of the parasite!\r\n\r\nSome of the most interesting objects in nature are the buds in\r\nwhich, all neatly packed and stowed away, the young leaves and\r\nflowers remain awaiting the warm breath of spring. They are most\r\ninteresting to examine: one finds series after series of overlapping\r\nscales which cover one another in the most ingenious way. No two are\r\nexactly alike, but each seems to have been moulded exactly to the\r\nproper shape. There is no waste anywhere, no useless expenditure of\r\nmaterial. Very often turpentine or resin or a sticky gum seals up\r\nthe joining of the scales. Every possible precaution seems to have\r\nbeen taken by nature. Neither rain nor snow can enter a winter bud.\r\nNeither can the cold of winter penetrate to the inside where the\r\nbaby leaves and flower petals are cosily and tightly coiled up. But\r\nobserve in the very earliest warm days of spring an extraordinary\r\nlittle insect, which has wakened up after its own winter sleep in the\r\nmoss or lichen covering the rough and crannied bark of an old apple\r\ntree. This is the Apple-blossom Weevil, a beetle only about quarter\r\nof an inch in length, but with a curious snout or proboscis half the\r\nlength of its body. This creature proceeds to the bud, and fixing\r\nits legs firmly, proceeds to bore a hole through the scales into the\r\nmiddle of the bud. She then places an egg inside, and goes on to\r\nput an egg in each of fourteen to forty-nine other buds. This takes\r\na fortnight, and then she dies, probably satisfied that her duty is\r\nfully performed. A little footless, cream-white maggot develops in\r\nthe apple-bud, which latter becomes rusty-coloured and dies away.\r\n\r\nAnother pest is the Apple-sucker, which lays her eggs in September on\r\nthe fine hairs which cover the shoots. As soon as the weather becomes\r\nmild and warm, little grubs come out of these eggs; they are very\r\nsmall, and their bodies are almost flat. These tiny flat grubs, as\r\nsoon as they are born, hurry off to the nearest buds and slip between\r\ntheir scales. They remain sucking the rich juices of the apple\r\nblossom until May or June, when they become perfect insects, and fly\r\naway so fat and well-nourished that they can live until September\r\nwithout feeding.\r\n\r\nBut those are by no means the only dangers. It is not till the apple\r\nblossom, which has escaped all those perils, opens in the spring\r\ntime, after its petals have unfolded in the warm air and the young\r\napple is already half formed, that the Codlin Moth begins to attack\r\nthem. This tiny little moth is then extremely busy. She lays about\r\nfifty eggs, but only one on each young apple. It is put in the one\r\nweak spot of the apple, just at the top, in the base of the withered\r\nflower. The grub tunnels down to the core and feeds upon the seeds,\r\nwhich are entirely destroyed. When it has grown sufficiently, it\r\ndrives another tunnel straight outwards to the skin. If the apple is\r\nstill on the tree, the caterpillar lets itself down on a long silken\r\nthread and hurries off to hide in any convenient crack or crevice of\r\nthe bark, or if the apple is already stored away, it conceals itself\r\nin the walls or in the flooring of the loft. The moths come out at\r\nthe end of next May, just when the blossoms are getting ready for\r\nthem. These codlin-moth apples cannot fail to have been noticed by\r\nthe reader, as the tunnels in the ripe apple are most conspicuous.\r\nThe gradual fattening of the caterpillar can also be traced, for its\r\nfirst tunnel down to the seeds is quite narrow, while the way out\r\ngets wider and wider as the creature became stouter and fatter whilst\r\neating its way through the flesh.\r\n\r\nThe Pear Midge attacks at the same place, but the mother insect has\r\na long egg-laying tube, and puts from fifteen to thirty eggs into\r\nthe opening pear blossom. The pears go on growing, but of course\r\nare quite spoilt by the maggots within. These latter have a curious\r\nspringing or jumping habit, and when they reach the soil bury\r\nthemselves an inch or two below the surface.\r\n\r\nSo that all the care and neatness with which the young flowers and\r\nbuds are packed up goes for nothing, and these insect pests get all\r\nthe benefits of the apple and pear!\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are hundreds of sorts of caterpillars which\r\ndevour the leaves bodily. Cabbage-white butterflies, magpie-moths,\r\ngipsy-moths, diamondback-moths, and others, lay their eggs in\r\nhundreds. Many lay 300 eggs each.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, somebody had sent an entomologist a present of\r\nsome eggs of one of these moths. They were placed on a paper near\r\na window which happened to be open; the entomologist went out, and\r\nthe paper must have blown across the street into a garden on the\r\nother side. At any rate, two or three years afterwards it was found\r\nthat some trees were badly attacked by this moth. Nobody thought\r\nmuch about this, though of course it was interesting to find a new\r\nmoth. But the pest became a very serious one. In consequence of\r\nthe stimulating air of the United States the moth multiplied with\r\nthe most extraordinary rapidity, and it is said that about 300,000\r\ndollars was spent in one year in the attempt to stamp it out.\r\n\r\nAll this happened because an entomologist forgot to lock up his eggs\r\nwhen he went away for half an hour!\r\n\r\nThese caterpillars and the locusts devour the leaves bodily, but\r\nthere are others which live inside them. These so-called \"leaf-miner\"\r\ncaterpillars make white irregularly-winding tunnels between the\r\nupper and the lower skin of the leaf. The tunnel increases or\r\nwidens because the caterpillar itself grows fatter as it eats its\r\ntunnel. They can be seen on a great many leaves, and can be at once\r\nrecognized by this peculiarity.\r\n\r\nPlants cannot run away from their enemies like animals, and it would\r\nseem at first sight that their case was very hopeless. But it is not\r\nso, for there is a vast, active, keen-eyed, and eager army of helpers\r\nalways ready for eggs and caterpillars.\r\n\r\nIt is birds that are of the greatest importance. A titmouse will\r\neat 200,000 insects in a season. A starling has been seen to fetch\r\nfood for its young ones from a grass paddock 100 yards away no less\r\nthan eighteen times in a quarter of an hour. All the following are\r\nexcellent birds, and without a stain upon their characters: the\r\nplover, partridge, robin, wagtail, starling. Crows and wood-pigeons\r\nare under suspicion, for though the latter do good in devouring the\r\nseeds of weeds, and the former in destroying wireworms, both are fond\r\nof corn and take large quantities of it.\r\n\r\nThrushes, mavises, and blackbirds are amongst the most persevering\r\nand useful of our friends, but they are certainly fond of fruit. Yet\r\nthe good which they do is very much more than any possible harm\r\nwhich an injudicious indulgence in the juicy fruits of summer might\r\nbring about.\r\n\r\nThe sparrow cannot be given a character. Indeed, he is objectionable\r\nin every way, for he not only does no good himself, but he devours\r\ncorn and drives away starlings and other valuable and interesting\r\nhelpers.\r\n\r\nBut it is very difficult to say what will happen if man interferes\r\nwith the regular working of Nature. The starling has been a pest in\r\nAustralia, though here it does nothing but good work. We are still\r\ngrossly ignorant of many simple but very important facts. Even\r\nwhen we do know something, as for instance, that the peewit's or\r\nplover's whole life is occupied in clearing the ground of wireworm,\r\ndaddy-long-legs grub, insects' eggs, and the like, that does not help\r\nthe bird in the least. Plovers' eggs are regularly sold in enormous\r\nquantities. Every farm-labourer collects them, and the farmer never\r\ndreams of interfering.\r\n\r\nMan shoots down owls, kestrels, hawks, who prey upon mice, voles,\r\nand sparrows. Then, when some farmers are half ruined, he has Royal\r\nCommissions to find out why the voles have increased so much.\r\n\r\nThere are one or two peculiar contrivances found in plants which are\r\nintended to keep off insects, and which may be noticed here.\r\n\r\nThus, the importance of a moat (which almost always formed part of\r\nthe defence of a medieval castle) had been already found out by one\r\nor two plants.\r\n\r\nIn a particular kind of Teazle and in a large Sunflower-like\r\nComposite (_Silphium laciniatum_) every pair of two opposite leaves\r\nrun together, so that a little cup-like hollow is formed surrounding\r\nthe stem, in which water collects. Insects climbing up the stem\r\nand trying to get at the heads of flowers fall in and get drowned\r\nin this water; their bodies may be seen floating about in it, and\r\nprobably when these decay, their decay-products are of some use to\r\nthe plant.\r\n\r\nThis curious contrivance is only a development of a very common\r\narrangement. In most leaves you will find that rainwater is intended\r\nto run in a particular direction. There are little grooves and canals\r\ndown which it is supposed to go, and dry, thirsty hairs may be found\r\nso arranged as to intercept part of it. Thus in summer the plants\r\nare not confined entirely to the water from the ground, but are also\r\nrefreshed by the rain from above.\r\n\r\nBut if you look closely along these little channels, and especially\r\nat the base of the leaf where they join the stem, you will find\r\nthat dust particles washed down by the rain collect and form little\r\nstreaks and patches. The air is full of all sorts of dust particles\r\nwhich are made up of every conceivable substance. Many of these\r\nminute grains of dust will be dissolved in the water, and help to\r\nsupply the plant with food. Nor is that all, for if you take a\r\nhand-lens and examine these dust particles very closely, you will\r\nvery probably find small animalcula moving about. They are not\r\npretty; in fact they are quite horrible to look at. These are tiny\r\nmites which live in these places. Their office is probably to eat up\r\neverything eatable (including eggs of insects and spores of fungi),\r\nand their excreta as well as their own bodies will probably be\r\ndissolved in the water and go to help the plants.\r\n\r\nThe most certain place to find them is on the leaves of the lime and\r\nother trees in August. On the under side of the leaf little bushes\r\nof hairs can be found just where the veins fork. It is necessary to\r\ntake a pin and stir up these hairs to frighten them out, but when\r\nthis has been done, the lens will show the disgusting-looking little\r\ncreatures running hurriedly away. They are no doubt exceedingly\r\nannoyed at being disturbed in the midst of their sleep, for they\r\ncome out and forage for anything eatable at night, retiring for the\r\nday into these hairy grottos. The structure of these grottos is very\r\ncomplicated. They are often like little caves with a narrow entrance,\r\nand the sleeping chamber is quite within the leaf.\r\n\r\nA great many trees have these curious mite homes. The insects are\r\ngenerally the colour of the hairs, and are not easy to distinguish.\r\n\r\nAll those insects mentioned here have so arranged their life\r\nhistories that they come into existence exactly at the proper season.\r\nThe warmth of the sun, which opens the apple buds ever so slightly,\r\nstirs also the egg of the mite, the egg of the beetle, or the\r\nhibernating weevil, so that all these insect populations come into\r\nfull active life just when they can do the most damage.\r\n\r\nBut one must not stop there; the bird population is also ready, and\r\nis building its nests and feeding its young, just so soon as the\r\ninsect swarms are at their thickest and most dangerous stage.\r\n\r\nMan walks clumsily through this intricate tangle of living plants and\r\nanimals: he sets his big foot on a hedgehog (good for the insects),\r\nor on a mole (so much the better for wireworm), collects plovers'\r\neggs (to the great help of every insect), shoots an owl (to the\r\ndelight of voles and mice) or a whole brood of partridges, and in\r\nother ways makes a---- we had better say, shows that he is not so\r\nclever as he supposes himself to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nRUBBER, HEMP, AND OPIUM\r\n\r\n   Effects of opium--The poppy-plant and its latex--Work of the\r\n   opium-gatherer--Where the opium poppy is grown--Haschisch\r\n   of the Count of Monte Cristo--Heckling, scotching, and\r\n   retting--Hempseed and bhang--Users of haschisch--Use of\r\n   india-rubber--Why plants produce rubber--With the Indians in\r\n   Nicaragua--The Congo Free State--Scarcity of rubber--Columbus\r\n   and Torquemada--Macintosh--Gutta-percha.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupposing that in China or Japan you meet a native who shows the\r\nfollowing symptoms:--\r\n\r\n(1) Eyes hollow and surrounded by a bluish margin; (2) pupils\r\nmuch dilated; (3) with a stupid appearance; (4) with an emaciated\r\nbody; (5) of unsteady and staggering walk; (6) with a dreamy\r\ndisposition;--then, you may be sure that he is an opium-smoker. In\r\nsome of the Chinese provinces every man smokes ·03 to ·07 ounce of\r\nopium daily, but those who indulge to excess consume ·3 or even ·6\r\nounce. It is an excellent medicine when employed in a lawful and\r\njustifiable manner, for it calms the spirits and makes one sleep.\r\nBut its use is _always_ dangerous, even when employed in very small\r\nquantity, as in laudanum and morphia.\r\n\r\nIn the Fen country in England there used to be a very large sale of\r\nlaudanum pills which keep off asthma and rheumatism, but even there\r\nit is a dangerous remedy, for it is only too easy to fall under the\r\ncontrol of this drug either by injection of morphia, or by eating\r\nor smoking laudanum or morphia. De Quincey's _Confessions of an\r\nOpium-eater_ and Kipling's _Gate of the Hundred Sorrows_ give a lurid\r\npicture of the ruin of body and soul brought about by opium.\r\n\r\nIt is produced from the heads of the Opium Poppy (_Papaver\r\nsomniferum_). Any poppy (or indeed any plant of the Poppy order) when\r\nscratched or wounded exudes a thick white or orange milky fluid. This\r\nis called \"latex\" (or milk); it is always more or less poisonous, and\r\ngenerally contains some sort of resinous matter. Thus when the plant\r\nis scratched or pierced, a drop of this milky latex comes out and at\r\nonce hardens over the wound. Of course the plant is much benefited\r\nby this, for any destructive insect, unless it is a confirmed\r\nopium-eater, will be poisoned or killed; then also, if wounds are\r\ncaused by wind, heavy rain, or animals passing, the scar is at once\r\nhealed over and covered by the hardened opium, so that no dangerous\r\nfungus spores can get in to attack the plant. There is a mildew\r\nfungus and also a smut fungus (_Entyloma_) which attack the poppy,\r\nbut both these enter by the stomata and live between the cells of the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of the Opium Poppy is quite familiar; its\r\nupright stems, large, clasping, bluish-green leaves and conspicuous\r\nflowers may be seen in many gardens. It is rather interesting, and in\r\nmany ways; when young, the buds droop or hang down, and are entirely\r\nenclosed in two large green, hairy sepals. These last are soon thrown\r\noff, and then the flowers open out and display the petals with their\r\nrich black spots, and the crowded mass of stamens which surround the\r\ncentral greenish head. In bud these petals are \"cramb'd up within the\r\nempalement by hundreds of little wrinkles or puckers as if three\r\nor four fine cambrick handkerchifs [_sic_] were thrust into one's\r\npocket,\" as an old writer describes it (Grew).\r\n\r\nBees, and especially bumbles, are extremely fond of it, and even seem\r\nto be, in a way, opium-eaters, for they get quite exalted, almost\r\nintoxicated, and above their ordinary laborious selves. They scurry\r\nround and round the flower under the stamens or hover excitedly above\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt is at this stage that the opium-gatherer begins his work; he goes\r\nround the beds and collects the petals of the poppy to use later on\r\n(see p. 304). The poppy-heads are then half grown and bluish-green,\r\nbut they soon begin to turn yellow and ripen. When ripe they are\r\nmost interesting to examine. There is a large platform covered by a\r\nradiating star-like ornament, which is the stigma. Underneath this is\r\na circle of little holes just below the crown, but above the head.\r\nEach small hole has a flap. Now if you gather a ripe poppy-head on a\r\nfine dry day all these holes are open, and if you hold it upright and\r\nswing it vigorously from side to side the tiny seeds come flying out\r\nof the holes and will be thrown to a considerable distance. The stalk\r\nis supposed to swing in a high wind, and the seeds are really slung\r\nor thrown out of the holes. But if, when you come home, you put your\r\npoppy-head in water, or look at the plants in the garden on a very\r\nwet day, you will find that every hole closes or is shut up, because\r\nthe small door mentioned above expands so as to close the opening.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are only sent out on a fine dry day; but they travel\r\nwell. It was observed in America that certain poppies had been\r\nintroduced as weeds at a certain place; in fifteen years they were\r\nfound twenty-five miles farther on, so that they were colonizing the\r\ncountry at the rate of three-fifths of a mile per annum.[132] The\r\nseeds themselves are very light and are of some value; they may be\r\neaten like caraway-seed, as comfits, or crushed to supply an oil for\r\nlamps, or used as medicine. It is said that the value of the seed\r\nraised in France was in one year £170,000. The heads themselves are\r\nalso valuable (they are worth 35s. per thousand), and even the dried\r\nstalks and leaves, for they may be used as fodder.\r\n\r\n  [132] This is not quite certain.\r\n\r\nBut the real reason why the plant is cultivated in so many parts of\r\nthe earth is the great value of the opium obtained from it. This is\r\ngathered in the following curious way. As soon as the dew has dried\r\noff the plant, the cultivator goes round the beds and scratches every\r\npoppy-head with a tool made up of three knives tied together. That is\r\nthe time recommended by Theophrastus, and it is apparently still the\r\nusual time to choose. In the late afternoon, from four to seven, he\r\ncomes round again and scrapes off the congealed milk, which is then\r\nworked up into cakes and taken to the factory.\r\n\r\nIt is prepared by being kneaded, dried, and rubbed until it is of a\r\npale golden colour.[133] Finally, it is enclosed in a mass of poppy\r\npetals, sometimes mixed with the fruits of a kind of dock, and is\r\nthen ready for export.\r\n\r\n  [133] Rudyard Kipling has a most interesting account of the great\r\n  opium factory at Malwa.\r\n\r\nIt is cultivated in a great many parts of the world--Turkey, Syria,\r\nPersia, France, China, the United States, Germany, Queensland, but\r\nespecially in British India, where the immense plains at Malwa used\r\nto furnish opium worth about sixty million rupees annually (after\r\ndeducting all expenses). This was mostly exported to China, and\r\namounted to a tax of about threepence per head on every Chinaman;\r\nit was also sufficient to defray about one-sixteenth part of the\r\nexpenses of our Indian Empire. The story of how Great Britain forced\r\nChina to take our opium is not a creditable one nor agreeable to\r\nread. The plant was known in ancient Egypt, Persia, and Rome, and was\r\nused in China for at least two hundred years before our times.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & Underwood_\r\n  _London and New York_\r\n\r\n  GATHERING RUBBER IN TEHUANTEPEC\r\n\r\n  Incisions may be seen in the bark of the tree. The rubber milk\r\n  runs out from these into the vessel held in the man's hand.]\r\n\r\nWhat is supposed to be the original wild plant from which the opium\r\npoppy was derived seems to have been cultivated in the ancient Swiss\r\nlake dwellings, for the seeds of _Papaver setigerum_ occur there in\r\nabundance. The price of the crop may amount to £90 or £120 per acre.\r\n\r\nAnother very ancient plant is the Hemp, _Cannabis sativa_. It was\r\nknown to Herodotus, who says that \"in the country of the Massagetæ\r\nthere is a tree bearing a strange produce which they casting into a\r\nfire inhale its fumes on which they straightway become drunk.\" It is\r\na tall, rather handsome annual, with stems from three to fifteen feet\r\nhigh. It is cultivated all over the world, from the Equator to 60°\r\nnorth latitude, but for different purposes. In India it is chiefly\r\nfor the resin, \"haschisch, churrus, bhang.\" (That was the drug used\r\nby the Count of Monte Cristo.) In Russia it is for the seed and the\r\nfibre that the plant is cultivated, and in France, Italy, and Austria\r\nthe fibre seems to be the most important product.\r\n\r\nSome of the plants produce only stamens or male flowers. The fibre\r\ngiven by these is stronger and more tenacious than that of the\r\nfemale plant, which, however, is finer and more supple. The fibre\r\nobtained from the cold northern districts of Russia is said to be the\r\nstrongest of all.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the fibre is a long, tedious, and laborious\r\noperation. It is also unhealthy, for the fibre has to be \"retted\"\r\n(steeped in water so that the soft parts decay), \"scotched\" (that is\r\nthe hard wood must be broken and removed), and \"heckled.\"\r\n\r\nThis last process is familiar to all who are interested in political\r\nmatters. It consists of being drawn on hard points difficult to\r\ntraverse and of a very fine and sharp character! Hemp is the\r\ncommonest fibre for string, rope, etc.; it used to be employed for\r\nsailmaking by the Romans. Catherine de' Medici is said to have had\r\ntwo chemises made of hemp.\r\n\r\nHempseed is much appreciated by poultry and birds of all kinds (which\r\nmakes both harvesting and sowing rather difficult); but the chief use\r\nof the seed is to furnish a fatty oil used for soft soap, lighting,\r\nand painting. The remains, after taking the oil, are employed as a\r\ncattle food, but it does not form a satisfactory cake.\r\n\r\nThe chief interest of hemp is, however, the drug that is made from\r\nthe resinous juice. No doubt this has the effect of keeping off\r\ndangerous insects, for it is said that plants of hemp even keep off\r\ninsects from other plants planted close beside them.\r\n\r\nSometimes the leaves and stalks are dried in order to make the drug\r\n\"bhang.\" Many allusions to this substance are found in Eastern\r\npoetry, where it is called the \"Leaf of Delusion,\" \"Increaser of\r\nPleasure,\" and \"Cementer of Friendship,\" but madness is the result of\r\naddiction to its use.\r\n\r\nThe resin is collected by making the labourers put on leather aprons,\r\nand then run up and down vigorously through the hempfields. The\r\nresin is then scraped off the leather, or off their skins if they\r\nprefer to do without leather. It is either eaten or smoked. Burton\r\ndescribes how at every cottage door in East Africa the Arabs may be\r\nseen smoking bhang with or without tobacco. \"It produces a violent\r\ncough ending in a kind of scream after a few long puffs.\" In small\r\ndoses haschisch (resin) has pleasant effects, for people experience\r\npleasant illusions, good appetite, excitement, and laughter,\r\nfollowed, however, after an interval by stupor and sleep.\r\n\r\nPeople addicted to the use of haschisch roll their eyes violently,\r\nand have a wild, startled appearance.\r\n\r\nNaturally so dangerous a drug cannot be recommended unless under\r\nthe most exceptional circumstances, but it is employed in cases of\r\nasthma and insomnia. Haschisch and opium are the two great curses of\r\nthe Chinese, Malays, and the inhabitants of British India and the\r\nEast. They may be compared to \"drink\" in this country, but they are\r\nimportant medicines.\r\n\r\nAmong the most curious and interesting facts in Nature is the\r\nextraordinary variety of the ways in which at present gutta-percha\r\nand india-rubber are employed. We should not be able to ride\r\nbicycles, or in motor-cars; we could not use Atlantic cables and\r\nmany electrical apparatus; our railway carriages would be most\r\nuncomfortable; golf would be impossible; we should have no waterproof\r\ncoats and no goloshes [sic], if it were not for these valuable\r\nand extraordinary substances, india-rubber or caoutchouc, and\r\ngutta-percha.\r\n\r\nTheir history is full of romance, but perhaps the most striking part\r\nof it is just this fact. Because a few (only a very few) plants\r\nfound it necessary to protect their wood from burrowing beetles by a\r\nspecially poisonous and elastic substance, _therefore_ we can play\r\ngolf and enjoy free-wheel bicycles.\r\n\r\nThe rubber is derived from the resinous latex or milky juice, which\r\npours out from any wound in the bark of certain trees and creeping\r\nplants. This milk must be poisonous enough to kill the rash and\r\nintrusive mother beetle, who wishes to lay her eggs in the wood.\r\nIt must be elastic, because the branches and stems swaying to and\r\nfro in the wind require a yielding, springy substance, but resin is\r\ncontained in it, so that it promptly hardens and closes up the scar.\r\nThe traveller Belt, in his _Naturalist in Nicaragua_, mentions that\r\nthose trees which had been entirely drained of their rubber by the\r\nIndian gatherers were riddled by beetles, and in an unhealthy, dying\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the important rubber plants are found in wet, unhealthy,\r\ntropical forests; they are by far the most important jungle product\r\nin West Africa, as well as on the Congo River and in the Amazon\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nIt is quite impossible to describe the various rubber trees, and the\r\ndifferent methods of gathering rubber, but it may be interesting to\r\nquote from an account of the method of its collection in Nicaragua,\r\nby Mr. Rowland W. Cater.[134]\r\n\r\n  [134] _Chambers's Journal_, Oct. 24th, 1896.\r\n\r\nThe best season for tapping the trees of _Castilloa elastica_ is from\r\nAugust to February. It is best also to perform the operation early in\r\nthe morning before the daily rain, \"or in the evening after the rain\r\nhas fallen. The milk ... is white and of the consistency of cream.\r\nThe tree thrives best in moist but not marshy forests.\r\n\r\n\"It seeds in the tenth year, and ought not to be tapped before its\r\neighth year, or its growth may be much retarded.\r\n\r\n\"On reaching the group of trees, which numbered seventeen of various\r\nsizes, my Carib friends first cut away the twining creepers that\r\nalmost hid the trunks, and then carefully removed a couple of\r\nburuchas, natural ropes of rubber, formed in the following manner:\r\nFrom incisions in the bark, possibly caused by woodpeckers or some\r\ninsect, the juice often exudes, trickling down the trunk, in and out\r\nof the encircling creepers, and sometimes reaching the ground. The\r\nmilky stream coagulates and turns black as it runs, forming a long\r\nstrip or cord, with which the huléros often tie up their bales.\r\n\r\n\"The parasites removed, Pete and José strapped on their espuelas\r\n(climbing spurs), fastened at the knee and ankle, and having dug a\r\nsmall pit or basin at the foot of each of a couple of trees, passed a\r\nring of stout rope round the trunks and their own waists, and walked\r\nup with their machetes between their teeth. By lifting the rope at\r\nevery step they were enabled to stand almost erect, and when lying\r\nback in the ring both hands were at liberty.\r\n\r\n\"José, whom I watched closely, commenced operations immediately below\r\nthe first branch. With his broad-bladed sword he cut in the bark a\r\nhorizontal canal which almost encircled the trunk and terminated in\r\na V-shaped angle. From the point of the V downwards he next cut a\r\nperpendicular canal about two feet in length, which joined another\r\nhorizontal channel ending in a V, and so on to the ground. In the\r\nlast cut he inserted a large green leaf to serve as a funnel and\r\nguide the milk into the basin.\r\n\r\n\"The Brazilian rubber collectors always place a receptacle of tin\r\nor earthenware in the hole at the foot of the tree to prevent the\r\nadmixture of grit or other foreign matters; they also strain the milk\r\nthrough coarse muslin; hence the greater value of Pará rubber. But\r\nNicaraguan methods are primitive.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Congo Free State the taxes are paid by the collection of\r\nrubber. It is alleged that \"if the demands for rubber or other\r\nproduce were not satisfied, the people at fault were flogged often\r\nmost barbarously with a thong of twisted hippopotamus hide, called\r\nthe _chicotta_. Or else the natives were told to catch the women from\r\nthe offending villages, who were brought to the _Chef de Poste_ and\r\nimprisoned by him as hostages for the industry of their husbands.\r\nOr else the sentries shot some of the defaulters as examples to\r\nthe rest. Frequently there were armed expeditions into refractory\r\ndistricts and widespread promiscuous slaughter. The cannibal soldiers\r\nof the State or of the Company sometimes feasting on the bodies of\r\nthe slain.\"[135]\r\n\r\n  [135] _Contemporary Review_, Dec., 1905. Mr. Herbert Samuel, M.P.\r\n\r\nThe supply of rubber has of recent years shown signs of becoming\r\nexhausted. As time goes on the Indians of the Amazon and Orinoco\r\nmust every year travel deeper into the inaccessible forests of the\r\nAmazon, Orinoco, or in Nicaragua. Every year also makes it more\r\ndifficult for the Malagasy in Madagascar, or the Negroes in West\r\nAfrica and the Congo, to gather sufficient rubber for the world's\r\never-growing needs. Liberia, the Negro Republic, is said still to\r\npossess plenty of rubber; but it is probable that the true solution\r\nof the difficulty will be found in the plantation of rubber trees.\r\nThe exports from Madagascar in 1903 were valued at 2,585,000 francs;\r\nfrom Brazil, £9,700,000; from Nicaragua, 400,000 gold pesos (twelve\r\npesos to the £); from the Congo, 47,000,000 francs; but even then\r\nabout 85,000 rupees worth of rubber was exported from plantations in\r\nCeylon. Unfortunately the trees do not begin to yield until they are\r\neight years old, but the estimated profit per acre is very high, at\r\nleast according to some authorities, who give a yield of £88 per acre\r\n(in Nicaragua).\r\n\r\nOne cannot help hoping that this will be the case. When one thinks,\r\ne.g., of the Uachins in the forests at the head of Namkong, who spend\r\nforty days in carrying their rubber on men's shoulders across the\r\nmountains to Assam, or of the horrible stories of the Congo Free\r\nState, plantation seems decidedly a more satisfactory method of\r\nsupplying us with golf balls and bicycle tyres.\r\n\r\nThe first account of india-rubber is found in Herrera (Columbus's\r\nsecond voyage), who describes the way in which the natives play \"with\r\ngreat dexterity and nimbleness.\" \"They struck balls with any part of\r\ntheir bodies.\"\r\n\r\nJuan de Torquemada in 1615 gives quite a good description of the\r\nCastilloa rubber:--\r\n\r\n\"The tree is held in great estimation, and grows in a hot country.\r\nIt is not a very high tree: the leaves are round and of an ashy\r\ncolour: it yields a white milky substance, thick and gummy and in\r\ngreat abundance. It is wounded with axe or cutlass, and from the\r\nwound the liquid drops into calabashes: Indians who have got no\r\ncalabashes smear their bodies over with it (for nature is never\r\nwithout a resource), and when it becomes dry remove the whole\r\nincrustation.\"[136]\r\n\r\n  [136] Collins, _Gutta-percha and Indiarubber_.\r\n\r\nThe first patent for waterproofing seems to have been granted in\r\n1791. A Charles Macintosh invented the garment named after him in\r\n1823.\r\n\r\nVery little of the commercial rubber is obtained from the common\r\nindia-rubber Fig (_Ficus elasticus_) which we commonly grow indoors.\r\nThis is one of those species of the Fig family which are generally\r\nfound growing on the branches or trunks of other trees, though their\r\nown roots crawl down the trunk of the support to the ground. Once\r\nthese roots have reached the ground, they take firm hold and grow so\r\nlarge and thick that they may be able to hold up the Fig tree even if\r\nthe original support decays and crumbles away.\r\n\r\nThe gutta-percha which we use comes chiefly from Singapore, which\r\nis a sort of world's market for rubber. There are a great many\r\ndifferent varieties and substitutes of this substance, but the best\r\nkinds come from Malaysia, Singapore, Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. The\r\nuses of gutta-percha and of vulcanite, which is manufactured from\r\nit, are very varied. Thus, it is employed for the soles of boots,\r\ndoor-handles, pipes, ear-trumpets, buckets, submarine cables, etc. It\r\nis indestructible in sea-water, and does not conduct electricity.\r\n\r\nA very extraordinary exception to the general rule that latex is\r\nhighly poisonous, is found in the famous Cow Tree of Venezuela. This\r\ntall tree (it is often 100 feet high) is found in large forests near\r\nCariaco, on the coast of that country. Its milk is said to closely\r\nresemble ordinary milk in taste, and to be perfectly wholesome and\r\nnutritious, but it is rather sticky. This tree was responsible for\r\nall sorts of curious and extraordinary legends in the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nON CLIMBING PLANTS\r\n\r\n   Robin-run-the-Hedge--Bramble bushes--Climbing roses--Spiny,\r\n   wiry stems of smilax--The weak young stem of a liane--The way\r\n   in which stems revolve--The hop and its little harpoons--A\r\n   climbing palm--Rapidity of turners--The effect of American\r\n   life on them--Living bridges--Rope bridges in India--The\r\n   common stitchwort--Tendrils--Their behaviour when stroked or\r\n   tickled--Their sensibility--Their grasping power--The quickness\r\n   with which they curve and their sense of weight--Charles\r\n   Darwin--Reasonableness of plants--Corkscrew spirals--The pads\r\n   of the Virginian Creeper--The ivy--Does it do harm?--Embracing\r\n   roots--Tree ivy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many plants which depend upon and cling to other more\r\nsturdy kinds, and which would be quite unable to live upon the earth\r\nat all if they had not developed the most beautiful methods of doing\r\nso.\r\n\r\nIn autumn, as soon as the leaves of the Hawthorn have fallen off,\r\none is sure to find upon the hedges the common Robin-run-the-Hedge\r\n(Goosegrass, Cleavers, or Sticky Willie, for it is known by all these\r\nnicknames as well as by its proper name, _Galium aparine_).\r\n\r\nIts stem is exceedingly weak, but it will be found sometimes to be\r\nsix or seven feet long. It does not support itself, but is resting\r\namongst and entangled in the outer twigs of the hedge in such a\r\nmanner that it cannot be blown away by the wind or indeed picked\r\nout without its being broken. The young stems grow upright and are\r\nvigorous at first, but soon they cannot bear their own weight, and\r\nfall back upon a branch of the hedge. There are small curved little\r\nroughnesses along the stem and on the under side of the leaves of the\r\nGalium; these hitch on to the twig. Up to this point then the stem\r\nis supported, and the young part above grows until it also gets a\r\nlodgment, and so it goes on until it sometimes reaches right over the\r\ntop of the hedge.\r\n\r\nIts young flowering branches grow out towards the light away from\r\nthe main stem, and the yellow withered stem in autumn rests upon the\r\nhedge just as a piece of string laid upon it might do.\r\n\r\nThe Bramble and Rose manage to get a support in very much the same\r\nway, but in Great Britain the Bramble generally grows in open ground\r\nand its branches take root.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar, curved-back prickles of the Bramble and its arching\r\nsideways growth would of course hang it on to any horizontal branches\r\nin the neighbourhood. Kerner measured the length of the stem of\r\na Bramble which had interwoven itself into the boughs of a tree,\r\nand found that it was over twenty feet long, although it was only\r\none-third of an inch thick. In Chile one often finds hedges of\r\nBrambles ten to fifteen feet in height, which have been formed by the\r\naid of other plants, and also by the way in which the branches become\r\nentangled with one another.\r\n\r\nSome Climbing Roses act in a very similar way, especially if grown on\r\ntrellis, but the flower shoots always turn to the light like those of\r\nthe Galium.\r\n\r\nBut it is the creepers and lianes of the tropical forests that are\r\nthe most remarkable of all climbing plants. They twine round the\r\nstems and hang in great loops and grotesque folds from the branches.\r\nSometimes in the dense shade it may be difficult to see the main\r\nstem, for it is quite thin, though as strong as a piece of steel\r\nwire. It often happens, when hurrying through a rather open part of\r\nthe forest after game, that one's leg suddenly catches in a thin,\r\nspiny, wiry stem of Smilax or some such creeper. The first that one\r\nknows of the creeper is when a quarter of an inch of the spine is\r\nburied in one's flesh.\r\n\r\nAway up amongst the branches and foliage far above one's head, leaves\r\nand flowers are developed on numerous branches which have vigorously\r\npushed out as soon as they got near the sunlight, this tough, spiny,\r\nthread-like stem being their only connexion with the ground.\r\n\r\nThe development of these climbing plants is probably connected with\r\nthe dense shade of forests. In such places a young stem growing up\r\nwill become long and drawn out; its tip will droop over and hang\r\ndownwards. But there is a curious peculiarity in the growth of all\r\nstems. The stem generally grows more rapidly at any one time on one\r\nside, say on the north, and therefore bends over to the opposite\r\nside. After a time it will be growing most rapidly on the eastern\r\nside and then its head points westwards, and so on. The result is\r\nthat the tip of the stem swings in an irregular circle round the stem\r\nitself. Its head turns to every point of the compass in succession.\r\nSupposing a stone is tied to the end of a piece of string, and one\r\nswings the stone horizontally in a circle, then, if an upright stick\r\nis put in the ground and the string comes against it, the string\r\nwill coil itself round the stick because the stone goes on swinging\r\nhorizontally.\r\n\r\nOur young climbing plant in the shade of the forest acts in exactly\r\nthe same way. If there is any trunk of a suitable size, it will\r\nin the course of its revolving or sweeping round first touch and\r\nthen coil itself round and round the trunk.[137] Of these twining\r\nstems, one of the most interesting and beautiful is the common Hop.\r\nThe young shoots or suckers which come from the ground may be seen\r\nwaving their stems helplessly round in the air. If they cannot find\r\nsomething to cling to, then they form weak limp curves, but if one\r\nsuch shoot touches a pole it very soon obtains a hold, wraps itself\r\nround the support, and easily climbs up to a height of many feet. But\r\nthe Hop is worth examining closely. If one passes the fingers along\r\nthe stem, it feels rough and prickly. With the aid of a hand-lens, a\r\nwhole series of most exquisite little hooks will be discovered. They\r\nare like small pimples with two or three very fine and minute, sharp\r\ngrappling-hooks on the top. These prevent the stem from slipping off.\r\nIt is also helped in climbing by its leaves, which curve outwards,\r\nand are also provided with grappling prickles on the under side. At\r\nthe top of the stem the young leaves are close together, and folded\r\nnear the point, so as not to interfere with the tip finding its way\r\nin and out of a trellis-work or amongst branches.\r\n\r\n  [137] Henslow, _Origin of Plant Structures_; Warming, _Rev. Gen.\r\n  de Bot._, tom. 5, p. 213.\r\n\r\nThese grappling-hooks on the Hop are as perfect in their way, though\r\nby no means so beautiful and elegant as those which are found in the\r\nclimbing palm, Desmoncus, so well described by Kerner in his _Natural\r\nHistory of Plants_. It is one of the rotang palms which reach lengths\r\nof 600 feet, though their stem may be no more than 1-1/3 to 2 inches\r\nthick. The leaflets towards the end of the leaf are transformed\r\ninto strong spiny barbs which are exquisitely adapted to hang on to\r\nother plants. In many places, thickets in which these rotang palms\r\nhave developed are so matted and tangled together that it is\r\nquite impossible even to cut into them, and they are practically\r\nimpenetrable.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: IN A KENTISH HOP GARDEN.]\r\n\r\nSome of our common British twiners climb very quickly. A complete\r\nturn round the supporting pole was made in England, at Charles\r\nDarwin's home, in the following times. The Hop took 2 hrs. 8 mins.,\r\nWistaria 2 hrs. 5 mins., Convolvulus 1 hr. 42 mins., and Phaseolus 1\r\nhr. 54 mins. A Honeysuckle took 7 hrs. 30 mins. to make one complete\r\nturn round the support.\r\n\r\nRecently Miss Elizabeth A. Simons timed the rate of growth of the\r\nsame plants at the University of Pennsylvania. They seem to have been\r\nstimulated by the exhilarating atmosphere of the United States, for\r\nthey were all growing faster. The Hop did its turn in 1 hr. 5 mins.,\r\nPhaseolus took from 1 hr. to 1 hr. 20 mins., Convolvulus 57 mins.\r\nonly, Lonicera from 1 hr. 43 mins. to 2 hrs. 48 mins., and Wistaria 2\r\nhrs.[138] But there are curious variations in the rate at which these\r\nplants revolve.\r\n\r\n  [138] _Trans. and Proc. Bot. Soc. Pennsylvania_, Session 1897-8,\r\n  vol. 1, No. 1.\r\n\r\nThus when coming towards the light they go as fast as they can, but\r\nrevolve more slowly, and as it were reluctantly, away from it. It has\r\nbeen found in one case that the shoot took thirty-five minutes to do\r\nthe semicircle towards the light, and an hour and fifteen to twenty\r\nminutes going away from it, but this is not always the case, for\r\nsometimes the reverse takes place[139] (Baranetzki).\r\n\r\n  [139] Pfeffer, _Pflanzen-Physiologie_, vol. 2, p. 412.\r\n\r\nThese twining plants are not very common in Great Britain, and indeed\r\nin Europe. Some of them move or twine to the right (in the same\r\ndirection as the hands of a watch or of the sun), such as Convolvulus\r\n(Bindweed), Phaseolus, Ipomoea, and Aristolochia. Others, like the\r\nHop, Polygonum, Convolvulus, Honeysuckle, and Elephant's Foot, move\r\nin the opposite way from right to left, or \"widder-shins.\" But there\r\nis nothing very important in this distinction, for the Bittersweet\r\nmay be found twining in either direction, and in some plants part of\r\na stem may be twining one way and the other in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nIt is in the tropics, and especially in the rank, dark,\r\nmoisture-laden atmosphere of the coast jungle forests, that these\r\ntwiners attain their greatest development.\r\n\r\nThey show the most extraordinary variety. Sometimes a twiner hangs\r\nin elegant festoons from branch to branch, forming a convenient\r\nsuspension bridge for monkeys. Sometimes four or five are wound round\r\none another or twisted together, so that they look like some gigantic\r\ncable. In other cases they are knotted, looped, tangled, and twisted\r\nin the most inextricable manner.\r\n\r\nSome creepers are flat, like green ribbons or broad bands. In others\r\nthe dense mass of old, thick creepers and twiners round some sturdy\r\ntrunk becomes so thick and so fused together that when the trunk dies\r\nthe lattice-like arrangement of these creepers may keep them upright\r\nalthough the original supporting trunk is quite rotten and decayed\r\naway.\r\n\r\nMore usually, a tree will become unhealthy because its branches are\r\noverladen with the dense foliage and flowers of heavy lianes, and\r\nbecause both trunk and branches are so strangled in the embrace of\r\ngreat creepers that they cannot expand and develop in the proper way.\r\nThen a storm will overthrow the dead giant of the forest, and these\r\ncreepers, entangled with all the surrounding trees, will produce ruin\r\nand destruction all around.\r\n\r\nA regular duty of the foresters in India is to cut the stems of\r\nclimbing plants. These twining, trailing, rope-like creepers are,\r\nin fact, natural ropes, and are used as such in India, Burma, and\r\nother places. Sometimes they form natural bridges of living plants\r\nextending across a stream. The great suspension bridges in the\r\nvalleys of the Himalayas are sometimes made without a single nail\r\nor plank. They are just three ropes (one for the feet and two to\r\nhold on by) made of jungle creepers. Crossing one of these swinging,\r\nswaying creeper-bridges is not an easy matter for those whose heads\r\nare unaccustomed to depths of hundreds of feet below them, especially\r\nif combined with a motion of the creeper-bridge sufficient in itself\r\nto produce violent seasickness. Yet the natives run across them with\r\nloads on their heads!\r\n\r\nBut it is not necessary to go to the tropics to find interesting and\r\ningenious climbing plants.\r\n\r\nThere is a very common little British plant, _Stellaria holostea_\r\n(the Star of Bethlehem, Great Starwort, or Stitchwort), which is\r\ncommon in shady places, light woods, and by hedges. In the spring\r\nit grows very quickly, and the pairs of leaves are shut together\r\nover the growing point, so that the end of the stem is narrow and\r\ncan insert itself between the leaves and twigs of the neighbouring\r\nplants. As soon as such a growing end gets out of the foliage into\r\nthe light, each pair of leaves opens out and curves backwards, making\r\na pair of broad, curved hooks excellently suited to hang the stem on\r\nto the leaves or twigs. Then another period of growth follows, and\r\nagain a new pair of hook-like leaves opens out. The stem may be five\r\nor six feet long.\r\n\r\nIn a rather rare Speedwell (_Veronica scutellata_) a very similar\r\nmethod is used, but the leaves have special little backward-pointing\r\nteeth on their edges which assist in the attachment process.\r\n\r\nBut these leaves are not to be compared as regards perfection of\r\nmechanism with the tendrils by means of which plants climb. These\r\ntendrils are thin, flexible, twining threads, which may be formed\r\nby the modification of whole leaves, in other cases of leaflets, or\r\nsometimes of branches. Sweet Peas, Vetches, Passion-flowers, Vines,\r\nand many other plants possess them.\r\n\r\nThey are like twining plants in the way in which they revolve or\r\ntwine so as to wrap themselves round anything which they touch. They\r\nmove much faster than twining plants. A Cobæa tendril only takes\r\ntwenty-five minutes to make a complete turn, Passion-flowers take\r\nfrom half to three-quarters of an hour, and the Vine tendril takes a\r\nlittle over an hour to make one complete turn.\r\n\r\nBut in one way they differ altogether, for they are sensitive to\r\ncontact. If tickled, they contract and embrace closely the object\r\nwhich is touching them. They show a most extraordinary sensibility\r\nand sensitiveness.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, these tendrils have a finer sense of touch and\r\na much more delicate feeling of weight than any human being. They\r\ndetect the weight of twenty-seven inches of a spider's thread.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, best to explain what happens. A half-grown curved\r\ntendril of the Passion-flower is perhaps the most interesting to\r\nexperiment with, but any sort of tendril does quite well. If one very\r\ngently rubs the inner or concave side of its little hook, then in a\r\nvery few minutes, or even seconds, the tendril distinctly curves. If\r\nthis has happened naturally, as when for instance it has been rubbing\r\nupon a pea-stick, this curve makes it curl round the stick, and the\r\nmore it touches the more it curls, until the whole tendril is wrapped\r\nround the support.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, quite impossible to explain it all exactly: the\r\nsensitive part on the inside of the curve differs from the outside\r\nor convex part of the tendril; the former has a layer of elongated,\r\nthin-walled cells, full of the living matter, protoplasm, which are\r\nabsent on the outer side. Immediately the tendril touches the stick,\r\nthe outer convex surface begins to grow rapidly. It grows from forty\r\nto 200 times as fast as the inner side which touches the stick! Very\r\nsoon after it has clasped the stick the tendril becomes woody and\r\nforms a strong, woody, spiral coil.\r\n\r\nThese tendrils can be made to curve by a weight exceedingly small.\r\nThe most sensitive part of our own skins is quite unable to\r\ndistinguish so small a weight as is perceived by these tendrils. Even\r\nthe sensation of taste can only be produced by a weight eight times\r\nas great as that shown by some of them. Tendrils curve very quickly\r\nafter they have been touched. In twenty seconds some tendrils curve\r\n(_Cyclanthera_), others (_Passiflora_) take thirty seconds, and some\r\nof them require four to five minutes or even longer before they make\r\nup their minds to coil.\r\n\r\nEven more remarkable, however, is the fact that they do not coil\r\nwhen raindrops fall on them, giving a much harder blow than small\r\nweights. If one tendril touches or rubs against another, it is said\r\nnot to curve. They are persevering little things also, for Darwin got\r\na passion-flower tendril to curve when struck or rubbed no less than\r\ntwenty-one times during fifty-four hours.\r\n\r\nIf one reflects on all these curious facts, it is difficult to\r\nhelp feeling that these plants behave very much in the way that a\r\nreasonable animal would do. There are many other cases in which some\r\nvegetable does exactly what we should expect of reasonable beings\r\nunder the circumstances. The tip of the root (see p. 89), the\r\nSensitive Plant, the Monkey and Barberry flowers, are all well-known\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nSo that it is difficult to find anything in science to contradict the\r\ncomfortable belief that wide-open flowers and stretched-out leaves\r\nof plants as they drink in the warm rays of the sunlight are really\r\nenjoying themselves, whilst they are doing their day's work.\r\n\r\nAll these interesting facts are so beautifully described and so\r\ncarefully summed up by Charles Darwin, that we shall only earnestly\r\nrecommend our readers to get first that fascinating book _The Power\r\nof Movement in Plants_, and then read all the rest of his works.[140]\r\n\r\n  [140] For the above facts: Pfeffer, _Pflanzen-Physiologie_, vol.\r\n  2, pp. 423-8; Green, _Vegetable Physiology_, p. 389; Kerner,\r\n  _l.c._, p. 697; Bonnier, _l.c._, p. 305.\r\n\r\nThere are an extraordinary number of these plants and the tendrils\r\nare formed exactly where they will be most useful. Every part of a\r\nleaf may become a tendril. The whole leaf is changed into one in\r\nsome kinds of Lathyrus. In a very beautiful creeper which is not so\r\noften grown in greenhouses as it might be (_Gloriosa superba_), the\r\ntip of the leaf only acts as a tendril. Leaflets are often made into\r\ntendrils. The Clematis is the most economical of them all, for the\r\nleaf-stalk coils round and forms little woody rings which hold up the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of tendrils, it may be interesting to\r\nnotice the queer corkscrew spirals in which they roll themselves up.\r\nThese spirals are formed after the end of the tendril has tied itself\r\nto the support and become woody. The free part between the end and\r\nits own stem goes on revolving; now if you tie a piece of string at\r\nboth ends and make it revolve, you will see at once that it must coil\r\nitself into a double spiral, one part in one direction and the other\r\nin the opposite way, with a flat piece between them.\r\n\r\nOne might be disposed to think no more about these double coils; but\r\nhere comes in one of the curious, inexplicable coincidences which\r\nhappen so often in plant life. Such a coil is much stronger than a\r\nstraight bit of wire or string would be, because if pulled out it\r\nyields and is springy. That of course makes it less probable that the\r\ntendril will be broken. Attached by a series of wiry springs, the\r\nplant yields and sways to the wind, and it is not likely that it will\r\nbe torn away. Besides this, the coiling of the tendril pulls the stem\r\ncloser to its support, which is also a great advantage.\r\n\r\nCertain Virginian Creepers and Vines behave in quite a different\r\nmanner. The tendrils grow away from the light and so seek the shadow\r\nof the leaves. They are also divided into little branches. At the\r\ntip of each little branch is a small knob; if this should touch the\r\nwall or the trunk of a tree, etc., it immediately secretes a drop\r\nof cement and glues itself firmly to the wall. There is a curious\r\ndifference in different sorts of _Ampelopsis_ in this respect. There\r\nis no adhesive pad in one of them (_Ampelopsis hederacea_) until\r\nit touches, whilst _A. Veitchii_ has them more or less ready for\r\ngluing before they touch (though they become much larger and better\r\ndeveloped as soon as they rub against the wall).[141]\r\n\r\n  [141] Henslow, _Origin of Plant Structures_, p. 223.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of our common climbers, \"that rare old\r\nplant the Ivy green,\" has not yet been mentioned. It is exceedingly\r\ndecorative on walls, especially on ruins and on old tree-trunks in\r\nwinter time, where its dark, brilliant green is most effective.\r\n\r\nA violent controversy rages as to whether it does good or harm.\r\nUnhappily it does not do any good to trees. It does not suck their\r\nsap, for its roots do not get through the bark, but it does choke,\r\nwith its clinging branches, young tree-stems, and prevents their\r\ngrowing properly.\r\n\r\nAlso, in winter storms an ivy-covered tree is much more likely to be\r\nblown down. But on walls the ivy certainly does good, for it sucks\r\nup the moisture, and ivy-covered walls are much more dry inside than\r\nthose which are exposed to rain.\r\n\r\nIts method of climbing is very curious. All along the stem quantities\r\nof little roots are produced. They dislike light, like most roots,\r\nand creep into crevices and cracks, where they wedge themselves\r\nin by growing thicker. Thus the stem is anchored all along its\r\nlength. It is curious to find that these roots are formed before\r\na twig is actually touching the wall, so as to be ready for any\r\nemergencies.[142]\r\n\r\n  [142] Henslow, _l.c._\r\n\r\nOne interesting little point in the growth of the ivy on a tree is\r\nperhaps worth mentioning. The main stem runs nearly straight up the\r\ntrunk, and when young is pulled down into the crevices or cracks\r\nin the bark. But its branches leave the main stem at an angle of\r\nforty-five degrees or so to it; these latter may often grow in this\r\ndirection for a foot or eighteen inches, but then they gradually\r\nbegin to turn more and more distinctly up the tree. Still these\r\nbranches firmly clasp the trunk like arms spread out on either side\r\nof it, and make it almost impossible to dislodge the main stem.\r\n\r\nOld plants of ivy entirely surround the trunk. The flowering branches\r\ngrow straight out into the air, and have no tendency to cling to the\r\nbark. Their leaves are also different.\r\n\r\nThe ivy may be considered as a root-climber, although the branches\r\nassist by growing round the stem.\r\n\r\nA curious instance has been given me of the longevity of ivy and its\r\npower of clinging to life. A correspondent mentions the case of a\r\nScotch fir whose life was threatened by an ivy. The trunk of the ivy\r\nwas sawn through. That did not kill it, at any rate immediately!\r\n\r\nProbably the rain soaked up by the leaves, and by the roots in the\r\ncrevices of the bark, kept it sufficiently fresh to cling to life. As\r\nit refused to die, a ladder was brought, and it was dragged off the\r\ntree. No doubt it would have died if the weather had been at all dry.\r\n\r\nThere are some very beautiful tropical plants which also climb by\r\nmeans of their roots. These roots, the so-called girdle roots, grow\r\nright round the stem and embrace it, so that the climber is perfectly\r\nsupported.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to be impressed with the extraordinary variety\r\nof all these contrivances by which plants are able to escape the\r\ntrouble of supporting themselves. But such ways of life involve\r\ncertain disadvantages. Supposing there is nothing on which to climb,\r\nthe stems trail feebly on the ground, and are probably soon choked\r\nby the surrounding grasses. Curiously enough, there are varieties of\r\nthe Ivy, Wistaria, and the French Bean which are upright, and do not\r\nclimb at all. The Tree Ivy has all its leaves like the leaves of the\r\nflowering shoot in the common form. In America, _Wistaria sinensis_\r\nis often grown as a standard tree, and does not send out the long\r\nshoots, sometimes thirty feet in length, which are common when it\r\ngrows on walls. The dwarf French Bean has a thick stem and requires\r\nno support, yet it often puts out a long slender shoot which tries to\r\ntwine round something.\r\n\r\nIn a tropical forest also, the creepers, though they damage the\r\ntrees, yet manage to find space for their leaves and flowers: more\r\nvegetable matter is formed per square yard of ground than would be\r\nthe case if there were no climbing plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nPLANTS WHICH PREY ON PLANTS\r\n\r\n   The kinds of cannibals--Bacteria--Spring flowers--Pale,\r\n   ghostly Wood-flowers--Their alliance with fungi--Gooseberries\r\n   growing on trees--Orchid-hunting--The life of an orchid--The\r\n   mistletoe--Balder the Beautiful--Druids--Mistletoe as a\r\n   remedy--Its parasitic roots--The trees it prefers--The _Cactus\r\n   Loranthus_--Yellow Rattle and Eyebright, or Milk-thief, and\r\n   their root-suckers--Broomrape and toothwort--Their colour and\r\n   tastes--The scales of the toothwort which catch animalcula--Sir\r\n   Stamford Raffles--A flower a yard across--The Dodder--Its\r\n   twining stem and sucker-roots--Parasites rare, degenerate and\r\n   dangerously situated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word _cannibal_ is often used in a very loose and unscientific\r\nway. Amongst some savage tribes it is the custom to eat old people\r\nand young children; but this is only in seasons of famine and\r\nscarcity, when there is no other food available, and not because\r\nthey are specially fond of them. But amongst other tribes wars are\r\nmade for the special purpose of capturing fat young people to cook.\r\nSometimes they have become so accustomed to such delicacies that they\r\nare unable to get their food in any other way. Of course, when tribes\r\nbecome \"pure cannibals\" of this last type they have to be destroyed\r\nlike wild beasts.\r\n\r\nAmong plants we find all sorts of transitions and degrees of\r\ncannibalism. There are plants which sometimes, and, as it were,\r\naccidentally, attack others. But there are also real cannibal plants\r\nwhich live entirely on the life-juices and sap of other plants,\r\nand cannot exist by their own labours at all. Moreover, we can find\r\nalmost every conceivable state of transition. These can be clearly\r\nand definitely traced from those plants which depend on the labour of\r\ntheir own roots and leaves to others which have no leaves, and which\r\nconsist merely of one large flower and a large adhesive sucker fixed\r\non some one else's root.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is very often to know where to draw the line. Probably\r\nno flowering plant is quite independent of the labour and work of\r\nits neighbours. As we have tried to show in another chapter, a long\r\npreliminary cultivation by bacteria, lichens, and mosses is required\r\nbefore flowering plants can develop on bare rock. That is also\r\nnecessary in all cases where the soil is mineral or _inorganic_,\r\nwithout any _organic_ dust or fragments of vegetable or animal\r\nmatter. Bacteria must always begin the work by preparing nitrates and\r\nother salts.\r\n\r\nSo that only those bacteria which weather rocks can be called really\r\nfree and independent. But other bacteria, such as those which cause\r\ntyphoid, anthrax, hydrophobia, etc., are the best possible examples\r\nof pure cannibals, or, as they are usually described, parasites.\r\n\r\nThis last word is derived from a peculiar class of people in ancient\r\nclassical times, who used to appear whenever a meal was going to\r\nbegin, and received food without giving anything in return. They are\r\nrepresented by our tramps or by the \"sundowners\" in Australia, who\r\nappear as soon as the evening meal is ready and when there is no\r\npossibility of going any further on their journey.\r\n\r\nThe way in which plants became parasites or cannibals is a very\r\ninteresting part of plant life, and we shall try to trace some of the\r\nvarious stages.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, if one looks out for them in spring one is sure\r\nto find a whole series of beautiful spring flowers. There is the\r\nPrimrose, with its bright, hardy, yellow flowers; the Violet, whose\r\nstrong perfume much annoys the huntsman, for it spoils the \"scent\"\r\nand shows him that the end of winter has come; the delicate little\r\nMoschatel, the Lesser Celandine, the Bluebell or Hyacinth, Dog's\r\nMercury, the Male and the Lady Fern, and many others.\r\n\r\nMost of these begin to grow and are in flower early in the season.\r\nThat is because they are living on the _dead leaves_ of the last\r\nyear, or rather of two or three years ago. Their roots are breaking\r\nup and devouring, with the help of worms, beetles, and insects, the\r\nleaf-mould of past seasons.\r\n\r\nThey are quite dependent on the trees; they cannot exist except where\r\nsuch leaf-mould is formed.\r\n\r\nBut it is very difficult to tell whether these humble little herbs\r\nwhich live on the scraps that fall from the tall trees are either\r\nparasites or clients, which last do some good in return for their\r\nshare.\r\n\r\nProbably they are distinctly useful and good for the forest if this\r\nis considered as a whole _establishment_. They use light which would\r\notherwise be wasted, and their own dead leaves increase the annual\r\ndeposit of leaf-mould.\r\n\r\nThere are other plants, such as the Bird's-nest (_Neottia_) and\r\nCoralroot[143] Orchids, as well as Monotropa and others, which\r\nalso live on the rich, decaying leaf-mould of forests, but these\r\nare generally pale in colour, for they possess but little green\r\nchlorophyll. They are more directly dependent on the mould and have\r\nceased to do much work for themselves. Most of them in fact have\r\nentered into an alliance with fungi, and use these fungi to get their\r\nfood material from the dead leaves.\r\n\r\n  [143] In the first, the entangled underground stems and roots\r\n  resemble a bird's nest; in the second, the peculiar red rhizomes\r\n  are rather like coral.\r\n\r\nSuch fungi are always abundant in good, well-grown forests (see p.\r\n86). These Orchids and Monotropa have their roots and underground\r\nstems covered and wrapped round by the fungus threads, which extend\r\nfrom them in every direction, breaking up and decomposing the dead\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nThe colour of Monotropa is a pale waxen yellow, that of the others\r\nis usually a ghostly pale, opalescent, steel-blue or coral-like hue,\r\nwhich makes them very distinct in the dim, mysterious shades of the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nThese plants are undoubtedly of use, for they break up and decompose\r\nthe leaf-mould.\r\n\r\nAnother very interesting group are not well represented in this\r\ncountry. Sometimes one may see on an old tree a Gooseberry bush in\r\nfull foliage quite high up the trunk in the fork of the branches.\r\nIn sheltered woody ravines, Polypody ferns are often established on\r\nold moss-clad branches, where their green fronds hang over to catch\r\nas much as they can of the sunlight. But Orchids, Bromeliads, and\r\nFerns which grow upon the branches of great trees are one of the\r\nmost conspicuous and beautiful features of tropical woods. It is for\r\nthese tree-orchids that the orchid-hunter braves the head-hunters of\r\nBorneo or traverses the precipices and rugged forests of Guatemala\r\nand Brazil. It is often necessary to cut down a tall tree in order\r\nto get the orchids in its higher branches. Often, however, this is\r\nunsuccessful, for the tree is so held up by creepers and other giants\r\nof the forest that it never reaches the ground!\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Photo_    _Skeen and Co._\r\n\r\n  CINNAMON PEELING IN CEYLON]\r\n\r\nThen, after being stripped from the branches, in some\r\nout-of-the-way forest-clad range of Burma, Celebes, South America,\r\nor Madagascar, these orchids are dried, put up in crates and packed\r\noff to London, where they are carefully cultivated in hot-houses and\r\npersuaded to flower. They may be worth sixpence or they may be worth\r\n£500 each, but no one can tell until they have flowered in London.\r\n\r\nBut the romance of the orchid-hunter is not exactly what we have to\r\ndescribe here. It is rather the romance of the life of the orchid\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIt is perched high up on the branches of the tallest trees in the\r\nforest, exposed to sun, exposed to wind, and quite unable to gather\r\neither salts or rain from the soil. How, then, does it manage to live?\r\n\r\nThese orchids, it must be remembered, are only found in\r\nout-of-the-way and feverish, unhealthy places, where the aboriginal\r\nsavages still lurk and endure a dreadful existence of hunger and\r\nstarvation in dense tropical forests.\r\n\r\nNow the word \"dense\" explains the whole story. Those forests are so\r\nthick, so full of giant trees and exuberant growth, that civilized\r\nman even to-day in 1906 can make nothing of them, and leaves them to\r\nthe savage. The reason why vegetation is so luxuriant is simply that\r\nthere are both plentiful moisture and a hot, tropical sun. That makes\r\nthe life of the orchid possible, and also ensures malaria for the\r\nhunter.\r\n\r\nIt hangs out into the moist air long pendulous roots which act as so\r\nmany sponges absorbing and soaking in moisture. The tremendous energy\r\nof growth covers bark and branches with creeping plants innumerable,\r\nwith a profusion of moss, liverworts, and ferns such as we cannot\r\nimagine from our own experiences in this country. So the roots of our\r\norchid find on the branches rich leaf-mould, and it lives happily\r\nand contentedly on the salts and moisture accumulated by the mosses\r\nand other plants. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, rather like\r\nthose of a desert plant, so that it can store up water against a\r\nseason of drought.\r\n\r\nThese plants which grow in this way on other plants, do not, as a\r\nrule, greatly injure them, but many have not stopped at this stage.\r\nTake, for instance, the Gooseberry growing in the fork of an old\r\ntree. Some bird has been eating gooseberries and dropped the seed\r\nthere. The roots of the gooseberry will grow down into the rotten\r\npart of the trunk. Earth and leaf-mould will accumulate there, and it\r\nis quite probable that the whole inside of the tree will decay away.\r\nThe roots of the gooseberry will, if only indirectly, help in this\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\nBut it is far otherwise with another set of plants--the Mistletoe and\r\nits allies. There is plenty of romance connected with the mistletoe.\r\nDr. M. T. Masters says as follows: \"The origin of the modern custom\r\nconnected with mistletoe is not very clear. Like many other customs,\r\nits original significance is only guessed at. If known, perhaps, the\r\ninnocent merriment now associated with the plant would be exchanged\r\nfor a feeling of stern disapproval, and the mistletoe would be\r\nbanished from our homes. In such a case ignorance is bliss.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that all the gods of Iceland were once gathered\r\ntogether so that a general oath might be exacted of every plant\r\n\"that grew upon the earth,\" that they would do no harm to Balder the\r\nBeautiful. The Mistletoe did not take the oath, because it does not\r\ngrow upon the earth but upon a tree. Then the enemy fashioned an\r\narrow out of the mistletoe, and killed Balder. There is a modern\r\nidea that the story is a myth representing the death of Spring, for a\r\ngreat many similar stories occur in widely distant places.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems pretty certain that the plant was a sacred one to\r\nthe Druids in the time of the Romans.\r\n\r\nOvid speaks of this in the line, \"Ad Viscum Druidæ cantare solebant.\"\r\nAt their solemn meetings, which were held in remote sacred groves,\r\na Druid clad in white robes cut the mistletoe with a golden sickle.\r\nThen, apparently, human sacrifices were offered and a general\r\nfestival took place.\r\n\r\nSome remnant of this custom seems to have persisted in Herefordshire\r\nuntil recent times, for the tune \"Hey derry down, down down derry\"\r\n(which means _in a circle move we round the oak_) is supposed to be a\r\nrelic of the hymn chanted by the Druids when they had found mistletoe\r\non the oak.\r\n\r\nIt was said in the Middle Ages to be a useful cure for apoplexy,\r\nmadness, and giddiness. That is not at present the general view.\r\nIndeed, under present conditions it might conceivably promote the\r\nlast and even the second of these disorders, though in an agreeable\r\nway!\r\n\r\nThe Mistletoe and its allies, Loranthus and Arceuthobium, grow upon\r\nthe branches of trees like the orchids and gooseberries already\r\nmentioned, but they differ altogether in having a special kind of\r\nabsorbing root which sinks down into the bark until it reaches the\r\nwood of the \"host\" tree. The sap running up the tree is then tapped\r\nby this root, and goes to supply the mistletoe with water and salts\r\nin solution. It has, however, its own green leaves. Thrushes eat the\r\nberries of the mistletoe; they will be left upon a branch with the\r\n_guano_; as the latter dries up, the seed is drawn to the underside\r\nof the branch, and sticks in a crack or crevice; it then sends the\r\nsinker-root mentioned above into the branch.\r\n\r\nEvery year afterwards new mistletoe \"roots\" are formed which grow\r\nthrough the soft part of the bark and send down sinkers into the\r\nwood. Cases of Mistletoes forty years old have been recorded. The\r\ntrees which they prefer are the Apple, and after that Black Poplar,\r\nthough mistletoe may be found on Silver Fir, various Pines, and\r\nothers. It is more difficult to get it to grow on the Oak than on any\r\nother tree. Indeed, only seven cases of mistletoe growing on oak have\r\nbeen recorded in this country.[144] It is quite a valuable crop in\r\nsome places, and is sent in tons to the London market.\r\n\r\n  [144] Dr. Bull, _Journal of Botany_, vol. 2, p. 273.\r\n\r\nThere are many species of Mistletoe, and at least one kind attacks,\r\nand is parasitic upon, another species of Mistletoe.\r\n\r\nMost Mistletoes and Loranthus have their own green leaves, and only\r\ntake from the plant to which they are attached sap and mineral salts.\r\nBut in Chile there is a beautiful Loranthus that has practically\r\nno green leaves at all. Its blood-red flowers grow in dense masses\r\nupon the giant Cactus, which is common on the drier hills, and\r\nthese are always mistaken for the Cactus's own flowers, which are\r\nquite different. These almost leafless Loranthus, and the curious\r\nArceuthobium are more parasitic than ordinary mistletoes, for they\r\nobviously take other food material (probably sugar and albuminoids)\r\nfrom their \"host.\"\r\n\r\nAnother series of parasites or cannibals are quite common in Great\r\nBritain. One often sees in some meadow that the grasses are growing\r\nin a scanty and unhealthy manner; one then notices amongst them\r\nnumbers of the Yellow Rattle or the Eyebright (which the Germans call\r\n_Milk-thief_). These plants are not very remarkable in any way, but\r\nif one examines them closely one sees that the leaves and stems are\r\nmore purplish-red than is at all usual with our ordinary flowering\r\nplants. But if you dig up some specimens very carefully, then the\r\nwickedness of the Yellow Rattle and Eyebright becomes apparent;\r\nevery here and there upon their roots are little whitish swellings\r\nwhich are firmly attached to the roots of other plants (generally of\r\ngrasses). These two robber plants send from these swellings minute\r\nsucker-roots which pierce into the grass-root and intercept the water\r\nwhich the grass has been absorbing for itself.\r\n\r\nThey are therefore parasites, and indeed they may cause a\r\nconsiderable loss of forage in a meadow.\r\n\r\nA good many other British plants are root thieves. Besides these\r\ntwo, there are the Cow-wheat, Red Rattles, Toadflax, Broomrapes, and\r\nToothwort.\r\n\r\nA curious point about them is that they differ amongst themselves in\r\nthe degree in which they are dependent on the work of others. Some\r\nare able to grow quite well without any such extraneous help, but the\r\nBroomrape and Toothwort are entirely dependent on others' labours.\r\nThey have extremely little chlorophyll and very small leaves, and are\r\nclearly parasites \"pure and simple.\"\r\n\r\nThere are about 180 species of Broomrape (_Orobanche_). All of them\r\nattack roots, and most confine their attentions to one particular\r\nflowering plant. Their colours are generally very striking and\r\nunusual. Our British species are reddish, flesh-coloured, or dirty\r\nwhite, but some of the foreign kinds are blue or violet, yellow, or\r\nyellowish to dark brown. Generally the seedling Broomrape worms its\r\nway down into the earth till its root-tip touches the root of its\r\nspecial favourite host, then the root of the Broomrape fixes itself\r\nfor life; its suckers grow into the host and absorb all the food\r\nmaterial which it requires. Those kinds which attack Tobacco and Hemp\r\nare dangerous pests and do considerable damage.\r\n\r\nThe Toothwort (_Lathraea_) is so called because its scales have a\r\nsort of resemblance to human teeth. With the curious superstition\r\nwhich prevailed in medieval times, it was supposed that the\r\nplant must be a remedy for toothache because it resembled teeth.\r\nUnfortunately this is not the case.\r\n\r\nIt is, generally, quite like the Broomrape in its method of growth,\r\nbut it sends out long thread-like branching roots with suckers on the\r\nends, which become fastened on the Hazel roots. For several years\r\nthe plant remains underground and forms very odd-looking, white,\r\nscaly branches. These scales are rolled back in such a way as to form\r\npeculiar and irregular cavities which open to the outside near the\r\ntip of the leaf. There is no doubt that animalcula of sorts get into\r\nthese cavities and probably die there. In that case, their remains\r\nwill form a useful supplement to the diet of the plant. The following\r\nremarks, however, taken from Kerner have been disputed by other\r\nbotanists.\r\n\r\nCertain of the cells lining these cavities \"appear to send out\r\ndelicate filaments.\r\n\r\n\"When small animals penetrate into the labyrinthine chambers of a\r\nLathraea leaf and touch the organs just described, the protoplasmic\r\nfilaments are protruded and lay themselves upon the intruders.\r\nThey act as prehensile arms in holding the smaller prey, chiefly\r\nInfusoria, and impede the motion of larger animals so as to cut off\r\ntheir retreat. No special secretion has been observed to be exuded in\r\nthe foliar chambers of Lathraea. But seeing that some time after the\r\ncreatures have entered the chambers, the only remains of them that\r\none meets with are claws, legs, bristles, and little amorphous lumps,\r\ntheir sarcode-flesh and blood having vanished and left no trace, we\r\nmust suppose that the absorption of nutriment from the dead prey here\r\nensues....\"[145]\r\n\r\n  [145] Kerner and Oliver, _Natural History of Plants_, vol. 1, p.\r\n  136.\r\n\r\nBut strange as these Broomrapes and Toothworts may be, they are\r\nquite inconspicuous as compared with the gigantic parasites found in\r\nSumatra and Java.\r\n\r\nIn 1818, when Sir Stamford Raffles was making a tour in the interior\r\nof Sumatra, his party came across one of those extraordinary plants\r\nwhich have been called after him.\r\n\r\nImagine a gigantic flower in shape resembling a very fleshy\r\nforget-me-not, but more than a yard across! The colour is a livid,\r\nfleshy tint, and the smell is like that of a charnel-house. This\r\nextraordinary _Rafflesia Arnoldii_ is the biggest flower in the\r\nworld. It has no proper stems or leaves, but consists merely of this\r\nhuge flower-bud attached to the roots of Figs, etc., which traverse\r\nthe ground in these forests. It is said to be only found in places\r\nfrequented by elephants, which are supposed to carry its seeds on\r\ntheir feet.\r\n\r\nThere are four other kinds known: all of them occur in Sumatra, Java,\r\nand other neighbouring islands. _R. Padma_ for example, has a flower\r\nabout eighteen inches across. The central part is a dirty blood-red,\r\nwhile the lobes have almost the colour of the human skin. This also\r\nhas a \"cadaverous smell, anything but pleasant.\"\r\n\r\nThese weird Rafflesias seated on the roots \"which wind about on the\r\ndark forest ground\" have impressed every observer.\r\n\r\nYet if one glances back, it is interesting to see how insensible\r\nare the transitional steps which lead from independent life by the\r\nplant's own exertions to these last \"pure parasites,\" which are\r\nentirely dependent on other plants for everything that they require.\r\n\r\nThe only other flowering plant which we shall mention in this chapter\r\nis now fortunately very rare in Great Britain. This is the Dodder,\r\n_Cuscuta_. It belongs to the Convolvulus or Bindweed order, but is\r\nentirely different from the rest of the family. Some climbing plants\r\ndo throttle or choke the trunks of young trees if they twine round\r\nthem too closely, but the Dodder has an entirely special and peculiar\r\nway of supporting itself to the detriment of others. It has no roots,\r\nno leaves, and scarcely any green chlorophyll; the Dodder is just a\r\ntwining, thread-like, yellowish stem which carries here and there\r\nsmall round clusters of little convolvulus-like flowers. Wherever the\r\nDodder thread twines round a hop or other plant, it puts out small\r\nsuckers which drive their way into the stem of the hop and take from\r\nit all the food which the Dodder requires. When well developed it\r\nforms dense yellowish tangles of intricately entwined threads, which\r\nmay cover whole bushes and entirely destroy the supporting plants.\r\nThe Flax, Clover, and Hop Dodders are perhaps the worst of them all.\r\n\r\nThere are some rather interesting points in the history of the tiny\r\ndodder-seedling. It remains, quietly waiting, for about a month after\r\nmost other plants have germinated.\r\n\r\nThen it begins to grow rapidly: its tip pierces the soil and becomes\r\nfixed in it; then the rest of the little thread-like seedling begins\r\nto curve round or revolve. If it touches a grass or even a nettle\r\nstem, it twines itself or coils round it, drives in its suckers, and,\r\non the strength of the nourishment which it extracts, it goes on\r\nrevolving or turning until it forms the dense tangled masses referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThen an eruption of flowers appears, from which later on hundreds of\r\ntiny seeds are let loose which will become Dodders in their turn.\r\n\r\nThe series of parasitic plants which have now been mentioned form a\r\nvery interesting set. It must be pointed out that those which live\r\nmerely on dead vegetable matter are \"good\" plants. They help on the\r\nquick and thorough employment of worn-out material.\r\n\r\nNor can we say off-hand that other parasites are \"bad.\" They do\r\nkill other plants and do them harm, but then, are they not like a\r\ncattle-breeder who sends his inferior cattle to the butcher, keeping\r\nonly those which are the very best of their kind? Perhaps these\r\nplants, by destroying the weak and unhealthy kinds, are doing a great\r\ndeal of good.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting point about such parasites is that they are\r\ngenerally _rare_. They must be less common than their \"host.\" Yet\r\nanother is that they are all \"degenerates.\" They show distinct traces\r\nof decay and bad development in their flowers and seed. That is also\r\ntrue in the case of parasitic animals.\r\n\r\nWhether they do good or harm to the world of plants is doubtful, but\r\nthere is no doubt that they are doing harm to their own chances!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nPLANTS ATTACKING ANIMALS\r\n\r\n   Brittle Star _v._ algæ--Fungus _v._ meal-worm--Stag-headed\r\n   caterpillars--Liverwort _v._ small insects--Natural\r\n   flower-pots--Watercups of Bromeliads--Sarracenia and inquiring\r\n   insects--An unfortunate centipede--Pitcher-plants: their\r\n   crafty contrivances--Blowflies defy them and spiders rob\r\n   them--Bladderwort's traps which catch small fry--Hairs and their\r\n   uses--Plants used as fly-papers--Butterwort _v._ midges--Its\r\n   use as rennet--Sundew and its sensitive tentacles--Pinning down\r\n   an insect--Suffocating and chloroforming the sundew--Venus'\r\n   fly-trap which acts like a rat-trap--Have plants a nervous\r\n   system?\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the whole the animal world preys upon the vegetable world, and is\r\nin a way parasitic upon it. Indeed, the connexion between the two is\r\nvery intimate--that of the diner and his dinner. One can scarcely\r\nimagine a more intimate connexion than this!\r\n\r\nThere are, however, a great many cases in which plants have turned\r\nthe tables on their enemies and deliberately laid themselves out to\r\ncatch and to destroy, to feed upon and to devour insects and small\r\nanimals. One finds a few examples in almost every group of plants.\r\n\r\nThus there are certain green seaweeds or algæ which are said to\r\nattack and prey upon those peculiar sea-urchins known as Brittle\r\nStars. The fungus which forms loops, acting exactly like a poacher's\r\nrabbit-snare, in order to catch mealworms, has been already mentioned.\r\n\r\nSometimes in the summer one may notice a little red club about two\r\nto three inches long sticking out of short grass. If one carefully\r\npulls this up it is found to be growing out of a dead chrysalis or\r\ngrub. It is a fungus whose spores have attacked the caterpillar; they\r\nhave developed inside its body, and eventually, having completely\r\neaten up the insect, form the red club, which is producing hundreds\r\nof thousands of spores intended to attack other caterpillars.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The branches like stag's horns are the fruit of\r\n  a fungus, Cordyceps Taylori, which lived inside and killed the\r\n  caterpillar.]\r\n\r\nAn allied fungus forms a peculiar branched fruit rather like a minute\r\nstag's horn, and the caterpillar may be seen for some time crawling\r\nabout with this extraordinary fungus sticking out of its head. Of\r\ncourse the bacteria are, some of them, by far the most dangerous foes\r\nof animals (see page 328).\r\n\r\nThen there is a small Liverwort, a little red, moss-like plant\r\n(_Frullania tamarisci_), which may be found growing on the bark of\r\ntrees, which is said to catch animalcula in the small sack-like\r\nleaves which are underneath the ordinary ones.\r\n\r\nBut it is amongst the higher flowering plants that one discovers the\r\nmost extraordinary and purposeful arrangements for capturing and\r\ndigesting insects and other creatures.\r\n\r\nIn the case of many of these insectivorous plants, traps or pitfalls\r\nare prepared for the insect to fall into.\r\n\r\nThere are many plants in which the rain is intended to run in\r\none particular direction, and it is not at all uncommon to find\r\nhollows at the base of the leaf where dust, dirt, and dead insects\r\naccumulate. One very curious plant of this sort is _Dischidia\r\nRafflesiana_, in which the leaves have become quite like a pitcher,\r\nand have been compared to \"natural flower-pots\" intended to hold rain\r\nand leaf-mould.[146]\r\n\r\n  [146] Groom, _Ann. Bot._, 1903, p. 223.\r\n\r\nThen there is the Bromelia or Pineapple family, which consists for\r\nthe most part of plants which live on the branches of trees. In very\r\nmany of these a small cup is formed in the middle of the rosette or\r\ntuft of leaves, and water collects in this central cup.\r\n\r\nThe water smells abominably, and contains the bodies of dead insects,\r\nand rubbish of all kinds (see also p. 298). The remnants of these\r\ndrowned insects are probably of use, because any valuable nitrogenous\r\nor other material may be absorbed with the water by the plant and\r\nhelp to nourish it, but in such a rough contrivance as this there\r\nis nothing comparable to the Side-saddle plant, Pitcher plant, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe former, Sarracenia (or Side-saddle plant), is a common and rather\r\nwidespread North American plant, which is especially abundant in\r\nFlorida. It is cultivated in most botanical gardens, but can only\r\nbe grown in greenhouses. The leaves are about six inches to a foot\r\nlong, and are hollow, funnel-shaped tubes with a short, flat wing\r\nalong one edge. They may be an inch or two in diameter at the top or\r\nwider end, where there is also a sort of half-open lid which keeps\r\nrain from getting into the inside of the leaf. The colour of these\r\ntube-like or vase-like leaves varies. It is often variegated with\r\nbrown, red, and yellow, and is conspicuous enough even at a distance.\r\nThus insects fly to these vases and alight on the little cap or lid,\r\nwhere they find honey and enjoy themselves. Other insects crawl up\r\nalong the rim or wing of the vase, finding honey here and there along\r\ntheir road. Having got to the lid, the insect, being of an inquiring\r\nor inquisitive disposition, will look inside the tube and endeavour\r\nto find more honey therein.\r\n\r\nIt reaches the rim of the vase and finds that there is honey inside;\r\nit can easily crawl down, and fails to notice that the inside of\r\nthe vase is lined with long stiff points which all point downwards.\r\nThese points or hairs do not at all interfere with its passage down,\r\nand it proceeds to the honey which forms a smooth, slippery coating.\r\nThen, after greedily absorbing the honey, it tries to get out again.\r\nBut that is quite a different matter. Each one of these points or\r\nhairs is facing it, and the whole inside is smooth and slippery. It\r\nstruggles, slips, and falls into a pool of water which fills the\r\nlower part of the vase. That is what the plant has developed these\r\npitchers for. The body of the insect after a time decays away, and\r\nonly its empty shell remains. An extraordinary number of insects are\r\ncaught by these Sarracenia vases. Sometimes in one which is only ten\r\ninches long, three or four inches will be full of the corpses of\r\nblackbeetles and other drowned insects, and it is said that birds\r\noccasionally visit these vases in order to pick them out. There is\r\nprobably some sort of secretion in the water. \"A centipede 1-2/3\r\ninches long having fallen into a vase of _Sarracenia purpurea_ in the\r\nnight was found only half-immersed in the water. The upper half of\r\nthe creature projected above the liquid, and made violent attempts to\r\nescape; but the lower part had not only become motionless, but had\r\nturned white from the effect of the surrounding liquid; it appeared\r\nto be macerated, and exhibited alterations which are not produced in\r\nso short a time in centipedes immersed in ordinary rainwater.\"[147]\r\n\r\n  [147] Kerner, _Natural History of Plants_. Many details are taken\r\n  from this work in the present chapter.\r\n\r\nIn some Sarracenias the vase is brought up into a sort of hood or\r\ndome with the entrance at one side and below. There are thin patches\r\non this dome or cupola, and small insects, attracted by the light\r\nwhich comes through these bare places, remain dashing themselves\r\nagainst them or crawling over them just as flies do on a window-pane,\r\nuntil they become tired and fall down into the water below.\r\n\r\nThere is something horrible in the cold and careful way in which this\r\nplant arranges its baits for \"confiding insects. The latter are fed\r\nwith honey, even on the very border of the assassin's den, but after\r\nthis farewell revel they generally slip upon the smooth edge, and are\r\nhurled, like lost souls, down into the abyss.\"[148]\r\n\r\n  [148] Dennett.\r\n\r\nIn another plant, the Pitcher Plant (_Nepenthes_, so called from\r\nthe drug which produces the sleep of death), we find an even more\r\nbeautifully arranged pitcher which acts in very much the same way.\r\nIt is, however, only the end of a rather long leaf, or rather of its\r\nmidrib, that is turned up to act as a pitcher. There are similar\r\nstiff hairs pointing downwards, and honey is plentifully secreted.\r\nBut, in Nepenthes, there is also a distinct secretion which digests\r\nthe bodies of the drowning insects. The ferment resembles the active\r\nprinciple of the gastric and pancreatic juices of the human body,\r\nand, as acids are also present, the insect's body becomes changed\r\ninto nutritious juices which readily diffuse into the plant.[149]\r\nDr. Macfarlane found that when the pitchers were stimulated by being\r\ngiven insects, the liquid inside them could digest fibrin to jelly in\r\nfrom three-quarters to one hour's time.[150] But certain insects have\r\nsomehow managed to educate their larvæ to resist the gastric juices\r\nof Nepenthes.\r\n\r\n  [149] Green, _Vegetable Physiology_, p. 203.\r\n\r\n  [150] _Annals Botany_, vol. 3, p. 253, and vol. 6, p. 401.\r\n\r\nNear Fort Dauphin, in Madagascar, I found great quantities of\r\n_Nepenthes madagascariensis_. Almost every pitcher was one-third to\r\ntwo-thirds full of corpses, but in some of them large, fat, white\r\nmaggots, of a very unprepossessing appearance, were quite alive and\r\napparently thriving. These must have been the larvæ of a blowfly\r\nsimilar to that which has been mentioned by others as inhabiting\r\nSarracenia. At the same place a white spider was very often to be\r\nseen. Its web was spun across the mouth of a pitcher, and its body\r\nwas quite invisible against the bleached remains inside.\r\n\r\nIt had suited its colour to the corpses within, in order that it\r\nmight steal from the Nepenthes the due reward of all its ingenious\r\ncontrivances!\r\n\r\nA totally different arrangement is found in an inconspicuous and ugly\r\nlittle marsh and ditch plant called Utricularia or Bladderwort. It is\r\nvery difficult to see, for unless it happens to be in flower it is\r\nentirely submerged in the water. The flowers, which are purple, are\r\nconspicuous and easily seen even at a distance. On these submerged\r\nleaves there are hundreds of small bladders. They are about the\r\nsize of a pea, and are most ingeniously contrived to catch small\r\nwater-animalcula. The general idea of the bladderwort is exactly that\r\nof the eel-pots so common in some parts of the Thames. There is a\r\nsmall flap which acts as a trapdoor. Small creatures probably take\r\nrefuge in the bladders when pursued by the larger water-fleas, etc.,\r\nfor it must seem to them to be a safe and secure retreat.\r\n\r\nBut once within the door, they are imprisoned and cannot find their\r\nway out again. They perish inside and their bodies are digested by\r\nthe plant; on the inside of the bladder there are gland hairs which\r\nalso secrete a digestive fluid.\r\n\r\nThe bladderwort is dangerous to fish, for the little fry, when quite\r\nsmall, run their heads and gills into the bladders and are suffocated.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many kinds of Utricularia, and they occur in most\r\nof the great floral regions.\r\n\r\nOne of them has chosen a very extraordinary and curious situation.\r\nIt lives inside the little cups of water which, as we have already\r\nmentioned, are formed by the leaves of some Bromeliads. The insects\r\nin the water which ought to nourish the Bromeliad (_Tillandsia_)\r\nare really used by the Utricularia. Other Utricularias live in damp\r\nearth, moss, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is not only by traps and pitfalls that plants catch insects:\r\nmany have specially modified hairs which are quite efficient\r\ninsect-catchers.\r\n\r\nHairs are used by plants for many different purposes, and it is\r\nrather interesting to see how quite a simple organ like a hair can be\r\naltered. The stinging hair of the nettle has already been mentioned;\r\nmany grasses possess minute, rough, flinty hairs, which probably\r\nprevent snails from eating them. That also is probably the reason\r\nof the strong, rough, coarse hairs which cover the Borage and the\r\nComfrey.\r\n\r\nThen on the Chickweed and the Bird's-eye Speedwell there are lines\r\nof rather long, flexible hairs which at first sight appear to be of\r\nno use at all. But if you take either of these plants, and, holding\r\nit upright, place a large drop of water on the leaves, you will see\r\nthat these hairs are intended to carry the water down the stem.\r\nThe water runs along them. It is a very pretty little experiment,\r\nespecially if done in artificial light, so that these hairs are, like\r\nthe root hairs, intended to absorb or suck up water as it passes over\r\nthem. Then the Edelweiss and the Lammie's Lug (_Stachys lanata_) are\r\nentirely covered with white cotton-woolly hairs: these are intended\r\nto keep the water in the plant, and do so as effectually as a rough\r\nwoollen coat will keep out rain and mist. Silky hairs, downy hairs,\r\nand others are found wrapping up the tiny baby leaves in the bud:\r\nthey probably keep them warm, and perplex and ward off objectionable\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nBut, perhaps, the sticky or glutinous hairs are the most wonderful of\r\nall. They are found on many plants, such as _Salvia glutinosa_,[151]\r\nPlumbago, and Catchfly. One can see insects stuck on them and\r\nvainly struggling to be free, and the hairs undoubtedly prevent\r\ngreen-fly and other such pests from interfering with the honey of\r\nthe flower. In some of these cases it has been shown that the body\r\nof the insect is actually used as food, but that is more obvious\r\nwith two interesting plants which specially devote themselves to\r\nthe capture of insect prey. One of these is very often kept in the\r\nBoer farmhouses near Tulbagh, in South Africa, simply to attract\r\nthe flies, which are a perfect pest in those dry valleys. Another\r\nDrosophyllum, the Fly-Catcher, grows on sandy and rocky ground in\r\nPortugal and Morocco. This is also used by the peasants near Oporto\r\nas a convenient fly-paper.\r\n\r\n  [151] Macchiati, _Botan. Centralblatt_, 41, 190.\r\n\r\nIn both of these plants large drops of a sticky, glistening liquid\r\nare secreted by the hairs which cover the leaves. Any small insect\r\nalighting on the latter is sure to get covered by the liquid, and\r\nin trying to get away will become hopelessly involved in it. It is\r\nprobably soon suffocated, for the gummy matter will choke the small\r\nair-holes by which it breathes. Both these plants are said to secrete\r\nboth an acid and a digestive secretion.\r\n\r\nBut we have two plants which are even more interesting in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWalking over the rough marshy pastures or moors of Scotland one is\r\nsure to notice, generally on wet peaty and barren soil, a little\r\nrosette of bright, yellow-green, glistening leaves. If it is the\r\nright season there will be a handsome purple flower whose stalk\r\nsprings from them. This is the Butterwort (_Pinguicula_), and it is\r\nnot a bad name, for the leaves remind one of butter. The whole upper\r\nsurface of the leaves is covered with tiny glands secreting a sticky,\r\nglistening matter. It is said that there will be as many as fifty\r\nthousand of these glands on a square inch of the upper surface.\r\n\r\nNow in such places every one knows that there are quantities of\r\nmidges, and also that these insects are always exceedingly thirsty.\r\nThey prefer blood, it is true, but when they see these bright\r\nyellowish leaves they naturally go to them. When, however, the midge\r\ntouches the leaf, the sticky liquid clings to its wings and legs, and\r\nit cannot escape.\r\n\r\nSo far this does not differ from the Fly Catchers mentioned above,\r\nbut another very curious action then begins. If the midge or fly is\r\nnear the margin of the leaf, the edge of the latter begins to curl\r\nor roll inwards over it. It does so very slowly, and may not finish\r\nrolling over the insect for some hours. Whilst this is going on acids\r\nand \"gastric juice,\" or ferments which act in the same way, are\r\nbeing poured over the body of the midge, which is finally completely\r\ndigested. Next day, having finished the midge, the leaf majestically\r\nunrolls itself again and waits for another.\r\n\r\nThe juice contains rennet, and is used by the Lapps in making a\r\nhorrible delicacy called Tätmiölk. It has also been used by the Swiss\r\nshepherds for at least two hundred years, to cure sores on cows'\r\nudders.\r\n\r\nThe other British plant is the Sundew (_Drosera_). Every one who\r\nhas been on peat-mosses and moors probably knows its little reddish\r\nrosettes of small rounded or spoon-shaped leaves lying on bare peat\r\nor wet mossy ground. Each leaf seems to be covered by hundreds of\r\nglittering little dewdrops (whence the name).\r\n\r\nThe hairs or tentacles which cover the leaf secrete this glistening,\r\nsticky fluid. There must be about two hundred of them on a single\r\nleaf.\r\n\r\nAn insect flying about near the Sundew is sure to be attracted by the\r\nconspicuous glittering, reddish leaves, and probably alights upon it.\r\nThen it finds itself caught and begins to struggle, but this simply\r\nbrings it against more tentacles.\r\n\r\nNow happens the most wonderful part of the whole performance. All the\r\nneighbouring tentacles, although they have not been touched, bend\r\nover towards the struggling insect and pin it down in the middle of\r\nthe leaf. They do not bend over very quickly. In two or three minutes\r\nthey will bend over towards it through an angle of forty-five\r\ndegrees, and it takes them ten minutes to bend over ninety degrees.\r\n\r\nThere is something rather horrible in the sight of a large insect\r\nstruggling with these slow, remorseless, well-aimed tentacles; most\r\npeople free the insect unless, at least, it happens to be a midge.\r\nThe point which is so difficult to understand is to know how those\r\nuntouched tentacles know that the insect is there and exactly where\r\nit is. There is no doubt that they do know, for they behave exactly\r\nas if they were the arms of a spider.\r\n\r\nIf you put two insects on either side of the middle of the leaf, half\r\nthe tentacles will pin down one and the other half will deal with the\r\nother insect.\r\n\r\nAt the same time acids and ferments are poured out which digest the\r\ninsect. It takes about two days for a leaf to finish off an insect,\r\nand then the tentacles again unclose.\r\n\r\nMoreover it is difficult to deceive those tentacles. They will bend\r\nin for the tiniest piece of useful substance; for instance, a length\r\nof one-seventy-fifth of an inch of woman's hair will make them\r\nsecrete digestive fluid. One millionth part of a pound of ammonium\r\nphosphate will also produce secretion. But a shower of heavy rain,\r\ngrains of sand, or other useless material, will not cause any\r\nsecretion, and even if they do bend in a little, they soon discover\r\ntheir mistake and stand out again. If you try the same experiment\r\nunder a bell-glass from which the oxygen has been withdrawn by an\r\nair-pump, nothing happens; or if you chloroform the Sundew it will\r\npay no attention to small pieces of meat until it recovers from the\r\neffects of the chloroform.\r\n\r\nWhen these Droseras are taken to a greenhouse and experiments are\r\nmade on them, they run into very great danger. They are almost\r\ncertain to die of overfeeding or indigestion. It is impossible to\r\nkeep people from giving them too much to eat.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful little plant shows quite distinctly that there must\r\nbe some way of sending messages in its leaves. Somehow the message\r\ntravels from the tentacle which the fly has touched, down the stalk\r\ninto the leaf, and up into the other tentacles, and tells them that\r\nthere is something worth stooping for.\r\n\r\nNo one has explained this, and probably no one will ever do so.\r\n\r\nThe last, and in some ways the most interesting, of all these\r\ncarnivorous plants is Venus' Fly-trap (_Dionæa muscipula_), which\r\ngrows in North America from Rhode Island to Florida.\r\n\r\nIt is a quite small herb with a small circle of leaves which lie flat\r\non the ground. Each leaf ends in a nearly circular piece which is\r\ndivided by a very marked midrib. The two semicircular halves have a\r\nseries of teeth along their edges; these margin teeth are stiff and a\r\nlittle bent upwards. In the centre of each half there are three small\r\nhairs. On looking closely at these hairs one finds that each has a\r\njoint near the base; all over the centre of these leaf halves there\r\nare scattered glands which secrete ferments intended to digest any\r\nanimal matter.\r\n\r\nThe really interesting point is connected with these central jointed\r\nor trigger hairs; they are extremely sensitive. But when they are\r\ntouched it is not they themselves that are affected, but the entire\r\ncircular end of the leaf!\r\n\r\nSuppose an insect wanders on to the leaf and reaches one of these\r\nsemicircular halves, nothing happens until it touches one of these\r\nhairs, but then _both_ halves suddenly close together, exactly like\r\nan ordinary rat-trap! The teeth on the edges of the halves interlock\r\nlike the teeth of a trap, and the insect is caught and imprisoned.\r\n\r\nIts body is slowly digested away and goes to nourish the plant. The\r\nuse of the joint in the sensitive hairs can be easily perceived, for\r\nwhen the two halves shut up together, the hairs fold down exactly\r\nlike the funnel of a river steamboat when it passes under a bridge.\r\n\r\nThe closing of the two halves, which has been well compared to\r\nshutting up a half-open book, is very quick, as it does not take more\r\nthan ten to thirty seconds. There is an abundant flow of \"gastric\r\njuice,\" but the leaf takes a long time to digest its food. It may\r\nrequire three weeks to finish one insect. Moreover, if overfed, it\r\nmay turn a bilious or dyspeptic yellow colour, and wither or even\r\ndie. It only shuts for a short time if a grain of sand touches the\r\nsensitive hair, and, like Drosera, is not deceived in its food.\r\n\r\nThe Dionæa, Drosera, the Sensitive Plant, Mimulus, Barberry, and\r\nothers, all show us clearly that plants somehow or other act as if\r\nthey were conscious of what they ought to do. In fact, in all these\r\ncases, it is scarcely possible to help believing in some sort of\r\nrudimentary nervous system. At any rate Wordsworth comes near this\r\nbelief, for he has written:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is my faith, that every flower that blows\r\n    Enjoys the air it breathes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nMOSSES AND MOORS\r\n\r\n   Peat-mosses and their birds--Moorlands--Cotton-grass--Scotch\r\n   whisky--Growth of peat-moss--A vegetable pump--Low-lying and\r\n   moorland mosses--Eruptions and floods of peat--Colonizing\r\n   by heather and Scotch fir--Peat-mosses as museums--Remains\r\n   of children and troopers--Irish elk--Story of the plants in\r\n   Denmark--Rhododendrons and peat--Uses of peat--Reclaiming the\r\n   mosses near Glasgow.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain in this present year one finds exceedingly few\r\nplaces where the influence of man cannot be traced. Over most of the\r\ncountry, indeed, it is impossible to discover a single acre of land\r\nwhere Nature has been allowed to go on working at her own sweet will\r\nwithout interference or restraint.\r\n\r\nBut near Stirling, between the Lake of Monteith and the sea, there\r\nis a wide, desolate valley which is probably in exactly the same\r\ncondition as it was when the Roman legions halted to reconnoitre\r\nbefore Agricola passed onwards to Perth and Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this great peat-moss has been probably in very much the same\r\ncondition for some 200,000 years, which is a nice round number to\r\nrepresent the ages that have passed since the Great Ice Age.\r\n\r\nNow, as then, it is inexpressibly dreary and desolate; everywhere\r\nsaturated with water, and only to be traversed in dry seasons and\r\nwith much agility. Even with the greatest care the pedestrian may\r\nsink to the waist in a hole of black, slimy, peaty water. Moss,\r\nHeather clumps, Sedges, Rushes, and occasionally Cotton-grass, almost\r\nat one dead level, stretch right across from the one side of the huge\r\nvalley to the other.\r\n\r\nEven grouse are not common. In summer great numbers of gulls lay\r\ntheir eggs upon the moss. This also is one of the few places in\r\nBritain where great flocks of wild geese can be heard and seen, but\r\nonly at a distance.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to get near them, for the upright neck of\r\nthe sentinel cannot be seen by the stalker as he wriggles towards\r\nthe flock on his face, until long after the stalker himself has been\r\nplainly visible to the bird.\r\n\r\nOf all useless stretches of barren waste, such a moss as this seems\r\none of the worst. It would, of course, be possible to reclaim it;\r\nprobably, fertile fields and rich meadows _could_ be formed over the\r\nwhole valley, but it would not pay nowadays. There is so much good\r\nland available in Canada, the United States, and Australia, that this\r\ngreat stretch of our native country will probably remain as useless\r\nas it was in Agricola's days.\r\n\r\nIn the Scottish Lowlands and Highlands the moorlands are almost as\r\ndesolate. At a height of 1500 to 1600 feet in Southern Scotland there\r\nis nothing to be seen but the undulating lines of hills, all dark\r\npurple with heather or with the peculiar scorched reddish green of\r\nDeer's Hair and dried sedges.\r\n\r\nPerhaps on the nearer hills small streams may have cut a whole\r\nseries of intersecting ravines in the black peat. They may be six to\r\nten feet deep, and here and there the bleached white stones which\r\nunderlie them are exposed. Now and then the \"kuk-kuk-kuk\" of an irate\r\ncock grouse, and much too frequently the melancholy squawking\r\nof the curlew, irritates the pedestrian as he stumbles over clumps\r\nof heather, plunges in and out of the mossy holes, or circumvents\r\nimpossible peat-haggs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AN ARCTIC ALPINE PLANT\r\n\r\n  This is Draba Alpina from Cape Tscheljuskin, and it is drawn the\r\n  natural size. The stunted, closely set leaves show the inclement\r\n  character of the climate.]\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a remarkable fact that though these islands support\r\n44,000,000 of inhabitants, including at least 1,000,000 paupers and\r\nunemployed, one-seventh of Ireland and many square miles in Scotland\r\nare still useless peat-bogs!\r\n\r\nThe Bog of Allen alone covers 238,500 acres, and the peat is\r\ntwenty-five feet deep.\r\n\r\nIn some few places the peat is still used for fuel, and there is\r\na theory to the effect that peat reek is necessary for the best\r\nkinds of Scotch whisky, but neither grouse nor black-faced sheep,\r\nwhich live on the young shoots of the heather, employ in at all a\r\nsatisfactory way these great stretches of land.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to spin the silky threads of the\r\nCotton-grass which grows abundantly on the Scotch lowlands. It is\r\nneither a grass, nor does it supply cotton, but is called Eriophorum.\r\nIt is perhaps the one really beautiful plant to be found on them, for\r\nits waving heads of fine silky-white hairs are exceedingly pretty.\r\n\r\nThe heather itself gives a splendid red and purple shade, which in\r\nsummer and autumn is always changing colour, but it is monotonous.\r\nNeither the little Bog Asphodel with its yellowish flowers, nor red\r\nDrosera, or butter-coloured Butterwort, are particularly beautiful.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing such a country one understands something of the\r\nCameronian Covenanters who held their conventicles and took refuge\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which these mosses and moors have developed is most\r\ninteresting, and yet difficult to explain.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of peat-mosses, which, although there are many\r\nintermediate types, may be kept apart.\r\n\r\nThe first, like the one near Stirling, Lochar and Solway Moss, near\r\nDumfries, and Linwood, near Glasgow, have been formed in low-lying\r\nflat estuarine marshes.\r\n\r\nIf one refers back to page 210, it will be seen how reeds and rushes\r\nand marsh plants may gradually fill up river backwaters. Eventually a\r\nsaturated, marshy meadow is produced.\r\n\r\nThen comes the chance of that wonderful moss the peat-moss, or\r\nSphagnum. It is scarcely possible to appreciate its structure without\r\nthe help of a microscope and a good deal of trouble in the way of\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nIt is in a small way a sort of vegetable pump which raises water a\r\nfew inches or so. Stem and leaves and branches possess little cistern\r\ncells, which act both as capillary tubes raising the water and also\r\nretain it. The stems are upright and develop many branches, so that\r\nthey become a close-ranked or serried carpet of upright moss-stems\r\nsqueezed together, which floats on the surface of the water. Each\r\nmoss-stem is growing upwards and dying off below. In consequence, the\r\nbottom gets filled up by dead mossy pieces, which accumulate there,\r\nwhile the live moss-carpet remains floating on the surface of the\r\nloathly, black, peaty water.\r\n\r\nIn many peat-mosses the water gets entirely filled up, but that\r\ndoes not stop the formation of the peat-moss. It is now resting on\r\nthe water-saturated remains of its forefathers, and if water is\r\nabundantly supplied it goes on developing.\r\n\r\nThus in these lowland or estuarine peat-mosses the moss eventually\r\noccupies the water, and goes on growing. After this it develops like\r\nthe moorland mosses which cover most of the Lowlands and Highlands\r\nof Scotland. They cover the hills, and it looks exactly as if some\r\ngiant had plastered all those hills with a layer of six to ten feet\r\nof black peat from 1250 feet upwards.\r\n\r\nThe soil would at first be covered by a saturated moss-carpet of\r\n_Sphagnum_ and other mosses. Rainwater falling upon it was all\r\nretained, and very little could get away, for the Sphagnum carpet is\r\njust like a huge sponge soaking up and retaining the water.\r\n\r\nBut it sometimes happens in these great upland mosses that there\r\nare enormous falls of rain which continue for days. Then the water\r\ncollects _under_ the living moss-carpet and over the dead peat.\r\nIt may be gathered together in such quantities that the carpet of\r\nliving peat above it bursts, and a deluge of peaty water overflows\r\nthe surrounding country, destroying and spoiling everything that it\r\nencounters.\r\n\r\nThe worst of these inundations of black mud that has happened in\r\nrecent years was in December, 1896, near Rathmore, where 200 acres of\r\nbog burst and a horrible river of mud overflowed the country for ten\r\nmiles. Nine people perished, and enormous destruction was caused.\r\n\r\nThere have been many other cases. In 1824 Crowhill Bog, near\r\nKeighley, burst; and in 1745, in Lancashire, a space a mile long and\r\nhalf a mile broad was covered by peaty mud. There was also a case\r\nin 1697, where forty acres of bog at Charleville burst in the same\r\nway.[152]\r\n\r\n  [152] Miall, _Nature_, Aug., 1898, p. 377.\r\n\r\nAttempts have often been made to calculate the rate of growth of such\r\npeat-mosses. A great many of them began to develop on the mud left by\r\nthe ice-sheet when the glaciers retreated at the end of the Ice Age.\r\nThose mosses are therefore probably 200,000 years old. Some of our\r\nScotch mosses are twenty to twenty-five feet in depth, which gives\r\na foot in 10,000 years. By calculation of the weight of the peat\r\nformed, Aigner made out that a certain moss was 20,600 years old, and\r\nwas growing at the rate of two inches in a century.\r\n\r\nBut in Denmark ten feet has been formed in 250 to 300 years, and\r\nin Switzerland three to four feet of peat-moss has been formed in\r\ntwenty-four years.\r\n\r\nThis shows quite distinctly that there is no regular rate of growth,\r\nand indeed it is obvious that much must depend on the climate, on the\r\nrainfall, on the drainage, and other circumstances.\r\n\r\nSooner or later, however, a limit comes to the growth of the moss.\r\nThe surface then becomes gently curved: it is highest in the centre,\r\nand slopes very gently down in every direction to the edges.\r\n\r\nWhat happens next? The first sign is that the surface begins to dry\r\nup, and Heather, with grey Cladonia lichens, begins to grow on the\r\nprojecting tufts and tussocks.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, if gulls build their nests on such drying-up mosses,\r\npatches of bright green grass appear wherever the gulls are in the\r\nhabit of resting. That is due to the lime in their guano.\r\n\r\nBut under quite natural conditions a much more important and\r\ninteresting change begins.\r\n\r\nHere and there scattered over the moss, miserable little seedling\r\nBirches and Scotch Firs begin to struggle for life. Of course, if\r\nthere are hares and rabbits, or if sheep and cattle are allowed to\r\ngraze upon the moss, those firs have no chance whatever. They are\r\neaten down to the ground.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LAKE DWELLINGS IN EARLY BRITAIN\r\n\r\n  The Irish elk is the result of the day's sport of these\r\n  prehistoric Britons, who lived in houses built on piles actually\r\n  in the water, or in peat mosses. Their only boats were rough\r\n  dug-out canoes.]\r\n\r\nBut if allowed to go on growing they would no doubt cover the whole\r\nmoss with a wood of Birch and Scotch Fir. In time that wood would by\r\nits roots and its formation of fine leaf-mould so radically alter\r\nthe ground that a forest of Oaks might be possible.\r\n\r\nIt is in fact quite likely that most of our Highland and Scotch hills\r\nwere at one time covered by fine forests of Scotch Fir, of which the\r\n_Silva Caledonica_ spoken of by Tacitus was an example.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, evidence to show that this was the case. There\r\nis one strange peculiarity of peat which renders it a most useful\r\nsubstance to antiquarians.\r\n\r\nAnything lost in a peat-moss does not decay away, but remains in a\r\nblackened but still recognizable condition for hundreds of years.\r\nNot long ago a basket containing the bones of a child was found in a\r\nScotch peat-moss. There is also a story that an English trooper of\r\nthe fourteenth or fifteenth century, and his horse, were discovered\r\nin Lochar Moss, near Dumfries. The man's features were traceable at\r\nfirst, but fell into powder when exposed to the air; but the weapons,\r\nstirrups, etc., were all perfectly preserved. Bones of the extinct\r\nIrish elk have often been found. Not merely so, but the piles of lake\r\ndwellings and the rough dug-out canoes which were used by the early\r\ninhabitants of Britain have been discovered in a great many places.\r\nCoins of Roman, medieval, and modern times have been unearthed, and\r\nindeed there is no doubt that if Britain is still inhabited two\r\nthousand years hence, boots, sardine tins, brass cartridges, clay\r\npipes, and other characteristic products of our own days, will be\r\ndisentombed from the peat by enthusiastic antiquarians, and displayed\r\nin museums to admiring crowds of our descendants.\r\n\r\nThe reason is quite simple: in peat neither those bacteria which\r\ncause ordinary decomposition, nor worms of any kind, are able to\r\nexist, so that the material does not decay but accumulates, though\r\nit may be blackened by peat, water, and humic acid. It is for this\r\nreason that a peat-moss is such a bad or rather an impossible soil.\r\nNeither roots nor bacteria can thrive in saturated peat; therefore\r\nthe flora of a peat-moss is generally confined to the upper surface,\r\nwhere air and bacteria can reach the roots. Peat-mosses are also the\r\nhome of insectivorous plants, which get their nitrogenous food from\r\nthe insects which they catch.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this preserving effect of peat, it is possible to\r\ntrace the entire history of a peat-moss from the very beginning.\r\nRemains of the Dwarf Willow or Polar Birch have been found in\r\nEngland, showing that those now Arctic plants were then flourishing\r\nin Norfolk. These are generally in the lowest layers of peat-mosses.\r\nNext follow remains of the Birch and Aspen, which would be growing,\r\nas they do in places to-day, on mossy soil where the peat was still\r\nthin. Higher up in the peat one finds remains of Scotch Fir, showing\r\nthat at that time regular forests of Scotch Fir existed, e.g. in\r\nSutherlandshire and on Lochar Moss, where they do not grow at present.\r\n\r\nSome hold that the goats, black cattle, and ponies which have been\r\nkept since the Roman occupation at any rate, are responsible for the\r\ndestruction of these forests. Others hold that they were killed by a\r\nchange of climate. But they certainly existed.\r\n\r\nTrunks of Scotch Fir have even been found in peat at 2400 feet in\r\nYorkshire, and at heights in Scotland which are above all the present\r\nplantations. About this time it seems that the newer Stone Age men\r\nmust have been in Switzerland and Denmark, for their remains and\r\ncharacteristic weapons occur in those countries at the same level in\r\nthe mosses as the Scotch Fir.\r\n\r\nStill higher in the peat comes the Bog Oak. With it are in Denmark\r\nremains of the Bronze, Iron, and Roman times.\r\n\r\nIn Denmark the uppermost layers of the peat contain remains of Beech\r\ntrees. As this last tree only entered the country in the historic\r\nperiod, it is not found except in the highest layers of all.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we have not yet obtained in our own country the same\r\nevidence from the peat-bogs as to the history of the flora of\r\nBritain. It is at least probable that it was on very much the same\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to again cover our peat-mosses and moorlands\r\nwith forests of Conifers, Pines, Larches, and Spruces? There can\r\nscarcely be any doubt about it: it would be possible, and according\r\nto the best authorities it would even pay to change all land which is\r\nnot yielding more than 7s. 6d. an acre into forests of Pines.\r\n\r\nOne of the curious facts about peat is that though a peat-moss is one\r\nof the worst natural soils, yet broken-up and dried peat is excellent\r\nfor Rhododendrons, for Orchids in stoves and greenhouses, and a great\r\nmany other plants.\r\n\r\nPeat consists of very much the same substances as those that go to\r\nform leaf-mould. But the presence of humic and other acids, and\r\nthe saturation with water and consequently the absence of worms,\r\nbacteria, and also of air, make it impossible for plants to grow in a\r\npeat-moss.\r\n\r\nPeat-moss due specially to the Cotton-grass rather than the Sphagnum\r\nmoss is imported in great quantity from Holland, for use as litter\r\nfor horses. We have in this country plenty of peat quite good for\r\nthis purpose, but labour is too expensive for our home-grown peat to\r\ncompete with the produce of Dutch moors.\r\n\r\nBut that is by no means all the uses to which peat can be put. It is\r\ninteresting to mention a few of them.\r\n\r\n1. Peat is used as fuel.\r\n\r\n2. Growing Orchids, etc.\r\n\r\n3. Litter for poultry, cattle, and horses.\r\n\r\n4. Food for cattle, etc., is made by rubbing the peat into small\r\npieces and saturating with molasses.\r\n\r\n5. Paper and a kind of felt can be made of peat.\r\n\r\n6. Rugs and carpets can be made of peat-fibre.\r\n\r\n7. String and twine.\r\n\r\n8. Rough sacks and mats can be made of peat-fibre.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, though all these things can be produced out of\r\npeat-fibre, it has never paid to manufacture them, and there are very\r\nfew of the British peat-mosses nowadays where peat is even cut for\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\nIt seems much more likely that the end of these peat-mosses will be\r\nto become either agricultural land or forest.\r\n\r\nNear Glasgow a large area of a useless peat-moss has been reclaimed\r\nand made to yield excellent crops, by using the refuse of the city.\r\nThe disposal of such refuse used to be a most troublesome and\r\nexpensive process, but now it is turned to good effect.\r\n\r\nIt was suggested a few years ago that peat, which is not worth\r\nconveyance, should be burnt on the spot, and the energy transmitted\r\nby wires.\r\n\r\nThat would be quite impossible, in at least four years out of five,\r\nover most of Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nNAMES AND SUPERSTITIONS\r\n\r\n   Giving names the first amusement--Curious and\r\n   odd names--A spiteful naturalist--The melancholy\r\n   Bartzia--Common names--British orchids--Dancing girls\r\n   and columbines--Susans--Biblical names--Almond, apple,\r\n   locust--Spikenard--Tares--Effects of darnel--Daffodil--Acanthus\r\n   leaf--Ghost-disturbing branches--Elder or bour tree--Its powers\r\n   and medicinal advantage--Danewort--Mandrake--How to pull it\r\n   up--The insane root--Its properties--Plants which make bones\r\n   pink--The betel nut--Henna--Egyptian and Persian uses--Castor\r\n   oil--Leeks, onions, and garlic--Ancient use of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan has always taken a certain pleasure in giving names to both\r\nplants and animals. It was, of course, a necessity to do this, but it\r\nis probable that people enjoyed the process as they do now.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment there must be at least 200,000 plants named\r\nand described by botanists. So that the number of ecstatic moments\r\nenjoyed by humanity has been undoubtedly increased.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians, the Babylonians, and the Arabs named a great many\r\nplants, but for the most part those names are quite lost. Most of the\r\nknowledge of the Egyptians and Babylonians remained a close secret\r\nconfined to their priestly colleges or universities, and has entirely\r\nperished.\r\n\r\nFor centuries those fragments of the knowledge of Greece and Egypt\r\nwhich were preserved seem to have been translated and taught in\r\nLatin. Long after the Roman Empire had passed away, all knowledge,\r\nincluding that of medicine, of botany, and of law, was imparted in\r\nLatin, which indeed was supposed to be learnt by every educated\r\nperson almost until the present century.\r\n\r\nEven now descriptions of new plants have to be given in Latin, and\r\nthe name must have a classical appearance. Of course, nowadays, it\r\nwould be much more convenient and much more generally useful if every\r\nperson learnt English, German, French, and Japanese, but in this case\r\nof naming plants, the Holy Roman Empire still exercises its sway over\r\nthe whole world.\r\n\r\nVery often the names given to plants are of the most extraordinary\r\ncharacter. The Latin is curious and the Greek remarkable, yet\r\nsometimes they are both pleasant to the ear and have a pretty and\r\npoetical meaning.\r\n\r\n_Poggeophyton_, on the other hand, for example, means the plant\r\ndiscovered by Dr. Pogge, a German botanical explorer. _Wormskioldia_,\r\n_Zahlbrucknera_, _Krascheninikowia_, _Acanthosicyos_, _Chickrassia_,\r\n_Orychophragmus_, _Warczewiczia_, _Lychnophoriopsis_, _Krombholtzia_,\r\n_Pseudorhachicallis_, _Sczegleewia_, _Zschokkia_, are all names that\r\nsound harsh and look odd to us. Yet most of them are just called\r\nafter those who discovered them, or their friends. In many of the\r\nsmaller microscopic plants the names are really much longer than the\r\nplants themselves. Thus _Pseudocerataulus Kinkeri_ is a diatom which\r\ncannot possibly be seen without the use of a microscope.\r\n\r\nNames are and were given in the most extraordinary way. Not merely\r\ngreat botanists, but Themistocles, Aristides, Aristobulus, Virgil,\r\nand even Gyas and Clianthes, have plants named after them.\r\n\r\nYet that is not inexcusable, if people had not sufficient inventive\r\npower to do better. There was a naturalist who quarrelled with the\r\ngreat French scientist Buffon. Therefore he baptized as _Buffonia_\r\na group of ugly, unimportant little plants which had an unpleasant\r\nsmell. In other cases people have named plants after their\r\nsweethearts or friends.\r\n\r\nA British plant called Bartzia has a rather melancholy, desolate\r\nappearance. It was named when the author had just received the news\r\nof the death of his friend Dr. Bartsch.\r\n\r\nOne of the most usual complaints which one hears from those who are\r\nbeginning to study flowers is that the Latin names are so difficult\r\nand hard to remember. But they are not really more difficult than\r\nthe common popular names, and especially those of foreign plants.\r\nCheirostemon, for instance, which means stamens like a hand, is\r\nmuch easier to speak and to remember than _Macpalxochitlquahuitl_,\r\nwhich is its soft, meandering, Spanish-American name. Asperula\r\n(little rough one) is quite as good as Squinancywort, which means\r\na herb good for quinsy (it is moreover of no good in quinsy).\r\nPerhaps, however, Woodruff (which is really \"wood rowel,\" from the\r\nresemblance of the leaves to an old-fashioned spur), or Waldmeister\r\n(master of the woods), are as good names as Asperula. Then Erigeron,\r\nwhich means \"soon growing old,\" is an excellent description of the\r\nfaded appearance of this little weed, for which the popular name is\r\nFleabane (it has no effect upon these creatures whatsoever).\r\n\r\nHow popular names came to be associated with particular flowers is\r\ngenerally quite unknown. A fair number are called from the diseases\r\nwhich they are supposed to cure. Lungwort, however, was so called\r\nbecause the lichen Pulmonaria has a resemblance to lungs. Then in\r\ncourse of time people began to suppose it was a cure for diseases of\r\nthe lungs, which it is not.\r\n\r\nThe British Orchids are called Bee, Spider, Fly, and Hanging-man\r\nOrchids, because of a fancied resemblance to their namesakes.\r\nDancing-girls (_Mantisia_) was so called from a certain resemblance\r\nof the flower to a columbine. The true Columbine (_Aquilegia_) was\r\nso called because of a resemblance which some one saw to a circle of\r\nlittle doves with wings seated on a circular well.\r\n\r\nThe greatest objection to popular names, however, lies in their being\r\nso indefinite. Entirely different plants are known by the same name,\r\nand also in different parts of the country totally different names\r\nare given to the same plant. All such difficulties disappear if one\r\ntakes the trouble to learn the Latin names.\r\n\r\nThese also are often quite pretty. Luzula, Veronica (with its\r\npretty legend), Mimulus (the little monkey), Circæa (Enchanter's\r\nNightshade), Senecio (_the old man_, from its woolly head of fruits),\r\nNymphea, Naias, Carlina (_the old witch_), and so on, are quite as\r\npretty and as nice as Mugwort, Devil-in-a-bush, Hairy Rock Cress, and\r\nthe rest. One curious result of the use of popular names is seen in\r\nthe Biblical names of plants. The Rose of Sharon seems most probably\r\nto have been _Narcissus Tarzetta_, and not a rose at all. As regards\r\nthe lilies of the Field, Mr. Ridley has the following remarks. The\r\nHebrew word _Shushan_ was a generic name given to a mixture of\r\nflowers, exactly as we now talk of ferns, herbs, or grass. The Sermon\r\non the Mount was preached near the plain of Gennesaret, and there\r\nflourish the Anemone (_Anemone coronaria_), _Ranunculus asiaticus_,\r\nand _Adonis aestivalis_ and _flammea_, which are exactly of the same\r\ncolour and follow each other in close succession. This word _Shushan_\r\nis the original of the Christian name Susannah or Susan. The Arabic\r\nname for _Anemone coronaria_ is Susan.\r\n\r\nThe Almond of the Bible is the common almond which is wild in Syria\r\nand Palestine. \"Aaron's rod that budded was a branch of an almond\r\ntree; the bowls of the Golden Candlestick were designed from the\r\nalmond blossom. Even at the present time English workmen call the\r\nglass drops for ornamenting candlesticks almonds.\" The Apple of the\r\nBible was more probably an Apricot. The husks of the prodigal son\r\nwere probably the Locust-beans, sometimes called St. John's bread,\r\nbut it is quite probable that the \"locusts\" eaten by St. John were\r\nthe insects. At any rate, locusts are regularly eaten in the East.\r\nThe Locust Tree (_Ceratonia siliqua_), or Algaroba or Carob, has\r\nlarge, dark-purple pods; there is a pulpy material between the seeds\r\nwhich forms a valuable cattle food. The seeds are said to have been\r\nthe original \"carat\" weight of jewellers.\r\n\r\nThe Spikenard (_Nardostachys jatamansi_) belongs to the natural order\r\n_Valerianaceæ_. It is a wild plant of Bhutan found near Rangasnati,\r\nin India, and in ancient times it was transported on camels by the\r\nregular caravan route to Syria, Greece, and Rome. It was then worth\r\nabout £3. 10s. per lb. The essence is obtained from the roots,\r\nbut one hundred pounds of roots will furnish only half a pound of\r\nessence. Now it has but little value.[153]\r\n\r\n  [153] Heuzé, _Les Plantes Industrielles_.\r\n\r\nThe Tares sown amongst the wheat were probably the seed of the\r\nDarnel. When growing, this grass is very like wheat, and it would be\r\nquite possible to mistake one for the other until the flowers and\r\nfruit are formed. Darnel is one of the very few poisonous grasses.\r\nIt is said that the poison is produced by a fungus which is found in\r\nthe grain. When darnel seed is ground up with wheat the bread becomes\r\ndangerous, for the poison produces severe headache, vertigo, and\r\ngiddiness. Other authorities say that it causes in man and rabbits\r\neruptions, fits of trembling, and confusion of sight. It seems not to\r\naffect horned cattle, swine, and ducks.\r\n\r\nAs regards those plants which were specially beloved and venerated\r\nby the Greeks, there is not very much to say. Moly seems to\r\nhave been _Allium moly_, one of the onion or garlic family. It\r\nis not very remarkable in any way. Amaranth was apparently the\r\ngarden Love-lies-bleeding, called in France Queue-de-Renard and\r\nDiscipline-de-Religieuse. The Asphodel which covered the Elysian\r\nfields seems to be _Asphodelus ramosus_.[154] This grows in\r\nquantities in Apulia, and is said to afford good nourishment for\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\n  [154] Figured in Kerner's _Natural History of Plants_.\r\n\r\nThe Myrtle, with which the Athenian magistrates and victors in the\r\nOlympic games were crowned, is not really a European plant, though\r\nit has a wide range from Asia Minor to Afghanistan. It was sacred to\r\nVenus, and had some importance as a medicinal plant and for perfumes.\r\nIt was even used in cookery and for making myrtle wine, which last is\r\nsaid to be still prepared in some parts of Tuscany.\r\n\r\n\"Narcissus, son of the river Cephisus and of Liriope, daughter of\r\nthe Ocean, was a young man of great beauty who scorned all the\r\nNymphs of the country, and made to die of languor Echo, because he\r\nwould not respond to her passion. But one day returning from the\r\nchase weary and fatigued, he stopped at the side of a fountain to\r\nrefresh himself. There having seen his own face in the water, he\r\nwas so smitten with it and so greatly loved himself that he died of\r\ngrief. The Gods, touched by his death, changed him into a Daffodil,\r\naccording to the fable.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the account in M. l'Abbé Ladvocat's _Dictionnaire\r\nHistorique-Portatif_, Paris, 1760. Daffodil means appearing early\r\nin the year. The number of races, varieties, and forms of Daffodil,\r\nJonquil, etc., has become innumerable; yet it is doubtful if any\r\nare quite so graceful and absolutely charming as the _Narcissus\r\npoeticus_, supposed to be the original of the above legend.\r\n\r\nThe Acanthus leaf which was so much used in sculpture seems to have\r\nbeen that of _Acanthus spinosus_. It can still be traced in modern\r\ncarving, though, of course, it is very much altered and in a rather\r\ndegenerate form.\r\n\r\nIt is often very difficult to say why certain plants have received\r\nso much attention and veneration in ancient times. In some cases it\r\nis clearly because they are poisonous, and therefore become dreadful\r\nand awe-inspiring. Why, however, should a twig of Rowan (_Pyrus\r\nAucuparia_) be so often placed above the door of a Highland cottage?\r\nIn some way it was supposed to keep off evil spirits, but there is no\r\nspecial reason why it should have been chosen.\r\n\r\nThe \"Bour Tree\" or Elder (_Sambucus_) has been the centre of a\r\nwhole series of extraordinary and remarkable superstitions. Of the\r\nEllhorn (Low Saxon), or _Sambucus nigra_, Arnkiel gives the following\r\naccount: \"Our forefathers also held the Ellhorn holy, wherefore\r\nwhosoever need to hew it down must first make his request, 'Lady\r\nEllhorn, give me some of thy wood, and I will give thee some of mine\r\nwhen it grows in the forest'--the which, with bended knees, bare\r\nhead, and folded arms, was ordinarily done.\"\r\n\r\nThe flowers are an eye-wash and cosmetic, or they may be taken as tea\r\nor used as a fomentation. The berries are used for \"elderberry wine.\"\r\n\r\nA certain cure for rheumatism is to carry about a small piece of\r\nelder cut after the fashion of a rude cross.\r\n\r\nEvelyn speaking of it says: \"If the medicinal properties of the\r\nleaves, bark, berries, etc., were thoroughly known, I cannot tell\r\nwhat our countrymen could ail for which he might not fetch a remedy\r\nfrom every hedge, either for sickness or wound.\"\r\n\r\nThe other species (_Sambucus ebulus_, or Danewort) has had its name\r\nexplained as follows by Sir J. E. Smith: \"Our ancestors evinced\r\na just hatred of their brutal enemies the Danes in supposing the\r\nnauseous, fetid, and noxious plant before us to have sprung from\r\ntheir blood.\"\r\n\r\nOf all these, however, the Mandrake (_Mandragora_) is connected with\r\nthe most extraordinary and remarkable superstitions. The plant is\r\ndistinctly poisonous, and has peculiar divided roots which sometimes\r\nhave a very rough resemblance to the human body. It was supposed to\r\nbe alive, and to utter the most piercing shrieks when it was pulled\r\nout of the ground. In those accounts, which are based on that given\r\nby Josephus, it is the _person_ who pulls out the root, and not the\r\nplant, that shrieks, subsequently rolls on the ground, and finally\r\ndies in torments. Therefore, if you wish to pull up a mandrake, the\r\ncorrect course to pursue is as follows: Tie a dog to the plant by its\r\ntail, and then whip the dog. It will pull up the mandrake, and then\r\ndie in frightful agony!\r\n\r\nThis is the \"insane root\" of Macbeth, but its various uses, real or\r\npretended, are too numerous to explain in detail.\r\n\r\nThus it was used for the following purposes: as a poison, an emetic,\r\na narcotic like chloroform, in love-philtres and love-charms, as well\r\nas to dispel demons, who cannot bear its smell or its presence.\r\n\r\nThere are many of these relics of medieval times which are difficult\r\nto explain or to find a reason for.\r\n\r\nWhy, for instance, should old women always carry a sprig of\r\nSouthernwood to the kirk in their Bibles? The leaves are, however,\r\nsaid to be disagreeable to insects. The Lavender stalks usually\r\nplaced in linen both keep away insects and have a pleasant old-world\r\nscent.\r\n\r\nA great many of the properties possessed by plants are of the most\r\nextraordinary and unsuspected nature. The roots of the Madder (_Rubia\r\ntinctorum_), for instance, when they are eaten by swine or other\r\nanimals, change the colour of their bones, which become pink. This\r\ncurious property has actually been made useful, for physiologists\r\nhave employed madder in the study of the growth and development of\r\nbone.\r\n\r\nIn India and other eastern countries one is often shocked and\r\nsurprised to find an apparently quite healthy native expectorating\r\nblood in a most lavish manner.\r\n\r\nBut the native is only chewing Betel nuts, which have the power of\r\nturning the saliva red. The fruit is that of _Areca Catechu_, a fine\r\npalm which is cultivated, for this purpose only, in many parts of\r\nIndia and the East. The nuts are cut in pieces and rolled up with a\r\nlittle lime in leaves of the Betel pepper. It is said to turn the\r\nteeth red and sometimes to produce intoxication; at any rate, people\r\nbecome slaves to this disgusting habit, and they do not seem to be at\r\nall injured by indulgence in it.\r\n\r\nAnother extraordinary plant is Henna (_Lawsonia inermis_). The\r\nEgyptian mummies are found to have the soles of the feet, as well as\r\nthe palms and finger-and toe-nails, dyed a reddish-orange colour by\r\nthe use of henna. But the practice is continued to-day in most parts\r\nof the East, and no odalisque's toilet would be considered complete\r\nwithout the use of henna. It is even said that men dye their beards\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThe white horse used in processions by the Shah of Persia has its\r\nlegs, tail, and body dyed with henna.\r\n\r\nThe powdered leaves are used: they are made into a paste with hot\r\nwater, and then spread upon the place. It is grown in Syria, Egypt,\r\nAlgeria, China, Morocco, Nubia, Guinea, and the East Indies.\r\n\r\nIn China women dye their eyebrows with an extract of the petals of\r\n_Hibiscus Rosa-sinensis_.\r\n\r\nOne of the first plants to be utilized by man was the Castor-oil\r\n(_Ricinus communis_). It was used by the Indians from time\r\nimmemorial; it is mentioned by Herodotus (under the name Kiki); seeds\r\nhave been found in mummy-cases, showing the careful preparations\r\nwhich were made for the dead when starting on their travels in the\r\nother world!\r\n\r\nIt is one of the very commonest plants in the tropics and in\r\nsub-tropical or warm, temperate countries. It is rather handsome,\r\nand has large reddish-green leaves and handsome spikes of flowers.\r\nIt is said to be sometimes twelve feet high, but is usually only\r\nsix or seven feet. The seeds are mottled or marbled, and have a\r\ndistinct resemblance to a beetle when seen from above. It has been\r\nsuggested that this protects them from birds, or enables the latter\r\nto recognize the seed, which is strongly medicinal. That, however,\r\nis at least doubtful, and certainly pigeons are exceedingly fond of\r\nthe seeds and eat them in quantity. The oil is used for lighting, in\r\nmaking soap, and also in painting.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic Egyptian plant was the Leek, which with the\r\nonion and garlic seems to have been one of the very first to be\r\nbrought into cultivation. Herodotus says that on the Great Pyramid\r\nthere was an inscription saying that 1600 talents had been paid for\r\nonions, radishes, and garlic used by the workmen during its erection.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish priests were forbidden to eat garlic, which (with\r\ncucumber) formed the dishes most regretted by the Israelites during\r\ntheir wanderings in the wilderness. The Shallot comes from Ascalon,\r\nwhere it will be remembered Richard the First defeated Saladin\r\nthe Sultan, and where also Sir Sidney Smith defeated the Emperor\r\nNapoleon and made him miss his destiny. It was not brought to this\r\ncountry till 1548. Probably, therefore, Tennyson's Lady of Shalott\r\nlived somewhere else. Onions and leeks are of course popular in this\r\ncountry, and especially in Wales, where the latter has been the badge\r\nof the Welsh since they gained a victory over the Saxons in the sixth\r\ncentury. They wore it as a badge on that occasion by an order of St.\r\nDavid.\r\n\r\nBut in warmer countries onions and garlic are much more important,\r\nwhere they have flavoured almost every dish since the days of\r\nNestor's banquet to Machaon in Asia, and of the Emperor Nero in\r\nItaly, until our own days.\r\n\r\nBut the subject is so inexhaustible, depending as it does upon man's\r\npowers of invention and his tendency to weird superstitions, that we\r\nmust close this chapter and also the book.\r\n\r\nAnd we will end by asking the reader to think sometimes of all these\r\nmany and various ways in which plants help and interest man.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely because our life depends upon them. Everything that\r\nwe eat has been produced by plant life and plant work.\r\n\r\nTea, coffee, cocoa, and wine are pleasant because plants have\r\nproduced some essence which is found useful and agreeable by\r\nmankind. Even water would be tasteless and unwholesome were it not\r\nfor the minute diatoms and other microscopic vegetables in it.\r\n\r\nBut those who take an interest in flowers and leaves _for\r\nthemselves_, find that they need never spend a dull hour in the\r\ncountry. There is so much to see and to find out, even in the\r\ncommonest weed or the tiniest floweret.\r\n\r\nBut it is necessary to sympathize with them, to try to look at\r\nthings from their point of view, and not merely from an artistic or\r\ncollector's standpoint.\r\n\r\nThe romance of plant life then becomes a fascinating and engrossing\r\npursuit. But however long one studies it, the knowledge that the\r\nwisest naturalist can ever attain to must remain a negligible\r\nquantity compared with what he does not know.\r\n\r\nSuppose a mouse happened to stray into the office of the editor of\r\nthe _Times_, he might boast to his fellow-mice of his knowledge of\r\nthe \"higher journalism,\" but his opinions would not really be of very\r\ngreat value on the subject.\r\n\r\nHowever hard we study, and however much we observe and reflect upon\r\nthe working of this great world of Nature, we really cannot expect to\r\nknow more relatively than that little mouse.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the more we think, the more humble men of heart we become,\r\nand the greater also should be our reverence for the Creator of this\r\nwonderful universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n    Acacia, 108, 110, 111, 140, 179, 286\r\n\r\n    Acanthus, 369\r\n\r\n    Aconite, 231\r\n\r\n    Acorn, 256\r\n\r\n    Adansonia, 48\r\n\r\n
