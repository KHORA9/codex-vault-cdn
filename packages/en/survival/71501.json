W. BEEDE.\r\n\r\nBeing a continuation of the foregoing lists of Rogers, published in this\r\njournal, vol. IX, No. 4, pp. 232–254.[1]\r\n\r\nThe present paper deals with the fauna of the rocks, beginning at the\r\nbase of what Haworth has called the “Shawnee formation”[2] and\r\ncontinuing upward to the top of the Cottonwood limestone. The strata are\r\ntreated in ascending order. It must be borne in mind that it is the\r\nobject of these papers to bring out the fauna of the rocks of the Kansas\r\nCoal Measures in sufficient detail to establish time divisions on a\r\npaleontological basis. These lists are, of course, incomplete for the\r\nhorizons _in toto_, but it is hoped that they do give the characteristic\r\nfossils of the rocks of the Kansas river section in sufficient fulness\r\nto warrant some deductions of value. The fauna of the Lower Coal\r\nMeasures still remains to be completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=20.= KANWAKA SHALES (Adams MSS., by permission U. S. Geological\r\nSurvey). Bennett’s description:[3] “Above the last (Oread) limestone\r\nlies a heavy shale deposit, at least ninety-seven feet thick at\r\nLecompton. The lower sixty-five feet of this is a clay shale, then\r\nsixteen feet of arenaceous shale, then five feet of sand rock, above\r\nwhich lies eleven feet of sandy buff shales.” No fossils known from this\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n=21.= LECOMPTON LIMESTONE. Bennett’s description: “Capping the hills\r\naround Lecompton is a five-foot limestone in two layers, which we will\r\nprovisionally name the ‘Fusulina’ limestone; not that it alone bears\r\nthat fossil, but because of the abundance of _Fusulina_ in it. It is the\r\nlower of another triple system [formation] of limestones, the members of\r\nwhich are separated by a few feet of shale, and which retain this order\r\nas far as observed to the west. Above the ‘Fusulina’ stratum are five\r\nand one-half feet of clay shales, then one and one-fourth feet of blue\r\nlimestone, which weathers dark buff, like all its associate strata.\r\nAbove this are four feet of shales having a bituminous streak in the\r\nmiddle; then ten feet of light gray, easily disintegrated limestone.\r\nThis group [formation] may be called the Lecompton limestone, on account\r\nof their outcropping being near Lecompton. At Spencer, six miles west of\r\nLecompton, the upper part of the series [formation] finally disappears\r\nbelow the alluvial soils of the valley.”\r\n\r\nFrom near the horizon of the above formation, from a well in the road in\r\nthe bed of Deer creek (the one emptying into Wakarusa creek), near the\r\nShawnee-Douglas county line, the following species have been collected:\r\n\r\n_Fusulina secalica_ (Say).\r\n\r\n_Campophyllum torquium_ Owen.\r\n\r\n_Archæocidaris_ cf. _agassizi_ Hall.\r\n\r\n_Fenestella limbata_ Foerste.\r\n\r\n_Fenestella limbata remota_ Foerste.\r\n\r\n_Pinnatopora_ sp.\r\n\r\n_Polypora distincta_ Ulrich?\r\n\r\n_Polypora elliptica_ Rogers? It is quite probable that this is a\r\ndistinct species. It has fenestrules arranged in two intersecting series\r\nwhen viewed on the reverse side, and the branches are not striated. The\r\nfenestrules appear nearly square on account of their arrangement, but in\r\nreality they are subcircular. On the obverse side the nodes are very\r\nprominent and some of them appear to possess acanthopores.\r\n\r\n_Polypora_ cf. _nodocarinata_ Ulrich.\r\n\r\n_Rhombopora lepidodendroides_ Meek.\r\n\r\n_Chonotes granulifer_ Owen.\r\n\r\n_Productus nebraskensis_ Owen.\r\n\r\n_Productus pertenuis_ Meek.\r\n\r\n_Reticularia perplexa_ (McChesney) Schuchert.\r\n\r\n_Seminula argentia_ (Shepard) Hall.\r\n\r\n_Spirifer cameratus_ Morton.\r\n\r\n_Aviculopecten carboniferus_ (Stevens) Meek.\r\n\r\n_Aviculopecten maccoyi_ Meek and Hayden.\r\n\r\n_Aviculopecten occidentalis_ (Shumard) White.\r\n\r\n_Limopteria gibbosa_ (Meek and Worthen).\r\n\r\n\r\n=22.= TECUMSEH SHALES. A stratum of shales about seventy-five feet in\r\nthickness, nearly non-fossiliferous, of fine texture, containing\r\nabundant ferruginous concretions and occasional layers of soft shaly\r\nsandstone. According to Bennett, these may represent the Kanwaka\r\nshales.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n=23.= DEER CREEK LIMESTONE.[4] Three layers of limestone separated by\r\nlayers of shale. The total thickness of the formation is fifteen to\r\ntwenty-five feet. The principal stratum is the uppermost, which is from\r\nseven to twelve feet thick. Most of the fossils below are collected from\r\nthis upper layer. It is a massive, light gray limestone, tinged with\r\nyellow. The texture often varies much in a short distance, grading into\r\ninclusions or banks of blue argillaceous limestone in which the fossils\r\nare excellently preserved. It is best exposed at Calhoun’s Bluffs, in\r\nthe cut of the Union Pacific railroad three miles northeast of Topeka.\r\n\r\n_Fusulina secalica_ (Say).\r\n\r\n_Lophophyllum profundum_ (Milne-Edwards and Haime) Foerste.\r\n\r\n_Archæocidaris agassizi_ Hall.\r\n\r\n_Oligoporus minutus_ Beede.\r\n\r\n_Crinoid_ stems.\r\n\r\n_Fenestella hexagonalis_ Rogers?\r\n\r\n_Fenestella_ sp.\r\n\r\n_Pinnatopora pyriformis_ Rogers.\r\n\r\n_Polypora distincta_ Ulrich? Probably a new species. It differs from\r\nthis species in having fenestrules broader and shorter and slightly more\r\nslender branches. However, this may be due in a large part to the\r\nparticular portion of the zoarium of which our specimens are fragments.\r\n\r\n_Polypora nodocarinata_ Ulrich.\r\n\r\n_Septopora pinnata_ Ulrich.\r\n\r\n_Ambocœlia planoconvexa_ (Shumard) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Chonetes granulifer_ Owen.\r\n\r\n_Crania modesta_ White?\r\n\r\n_Derbya crassa_ (Meek and Hayden) Waagen.\r\n\r\n_Derbya keokuk_ (Hall and Clarke).\r\n\r\n_Dielasma bovidens_ (Morton) White.\r\n\r\n_Enteletes hemiplicata_ (Hall) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Meekella striaticostata_ (Cox) White and St. John.\r\n\r\n_Productus cora_ d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\n_Productus costatus_ Sowerby? de Koninck.\r\n\r\n_Productus longispinus_ Sowerby.\r\n\r\n_Productus nebraskensis_ Owen.\r\n\r\n_Productus pertenuis_ Meek.\r\n\r\n_Productus punctatus_ (Martin) Morton.\r\n\r\n_Productus semireticulatus_ (Martin) d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\n_Pugnax utah_ (Marcou) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Reticularia perplexa_ (McChesney) Schuchert.\r\n\r\n_Seminula argintia_ (Shepard) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Spirifer cameratus_ Morton.\r\n\r\n_Spiriferina cristata_ (Schlotheim) Dawson.\r\n\r\n_Allorisma granosum_ (Shumard) Keyes.\r\n\r\n_Allorisma subcuneatum_ Meek and Hayden.\r\n\r\n_Aviculopecten occidentalis_ (Shumard) Meek and Hayden.\r\n\r\n_Aviculopecten_ sp.\r\n\r\n_Entolium aviculatum_ (Swallow) Meek.\r\n\r\n_Myalina kansasensis_ Shumard?\r\n\r\n_Myalina swallowi_ McChesney.\r\n\r\n_Pinna peracuta_ Shumard.\r\n\r\n_Pinna subspatulata_ Worthen?\r\n\r\n_Bellerophon crassus_ Meek and Worthen.\r\n\r\n_Trachydomia wheeleri_ (Swallow) Keyes.\r\n\r\n_Pleurotomaria tabulata_ Hall.\r\n\r\n_Conularia crustula_ White? (Very large for this species.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=24.= CALHOUN SHALES. This formation is fifty to sixty-five feet in\r\nthickness. The lower part is a layer of soft argillaceous sandstone from\r\ntwelve to twenty feet thick. The upper portion of the formation is a\r\nbluish shale, arenaceous below, clayey above, and of comparatively fine\r\ntexture. No fossils have been collected from this formation, except a\r\nfew fragments of _Calamites_ and _Cordaites_ in a soft sandstone\r\nimmediately beneath the Topeka limestone, in the eastern part of that\r\ncity. The type exposure is at Calhoun’s Bluffs, three miles northeast of\r\nTopeka.\r\n\r\n\r\n=25.= HARTFORD (TOPEKA) LIMESTONE. (Adams’s MSS., by permission of U. S.\r\nGeological Survey.) The following section of the rocks is about as given\r\nby Doctor Bennett when he first described them:\r\n\r\n                                                                 ft. in.\r\n _g._ Limestone weathering buff                                    2   0\r\n _f._ Drab shales                                                  3   0\r\n _e._ Limestone weathering buff                                    1   6\r\n _d._ Buff calcareous shales with abundant fossils                 2   0\r\n _c._ Blue to brown limestone, always weathering to a brown        5   8\r\n        buff, cherty near the top, fossiliferous\r\n _b._ Blue shales                                                  1   6\r\n _a._ Blue limestone, weathering dark buff                         6   0\r\n                                                                 --- ---\r\n                  Total thickness of formation                    21   8\r\n\r\nMost of the fossils enumerated below were taken from layers _c_ and _d_,\r\nthough the entire set is more or less fossiliferous, with about the same\r\nspecies running through them.\r\n\r\n_Fusulina secalica_ (Say).\r\n\r\n_Amblysiphonella prosseri_ Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Lophophyllum profundum_ (Milne-Edwards and Haime) Foerste.\r\n\r\n_Crinoid_ stems and plates, referred by Bennett to _Zeacrinus\r\nmucrospinus_ and _Z. acanthophorus_.\r\n\r\n_Archæocidaris agassizi_ Hall.\r\n\r\n_Archæocidaris trudifer_ White.\r\n\r\n_Worm._\r\n\r\n_Fenestella shumardi_ Prout.\r\n\r\n_Fenestella remota_ Foerste.\r\n\r\n_Polypora elliptica_ Rogers.\r\n\r\n_Polypora submarginata_ Meek.\r\n\r\n_Rhombopora lepidodendroides_ Meek.\r\n\r\n_Septopora biserialis_ (Swallow) Foerste.\r\n\r\n_Septopora_ sp.\r\n\r\n_Ambocœlia planoconvexa_ (Shumard) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Chonetes granulifer_ Owen.\r\n\r\n_Derbya crassa_ (Meek and Hayden) Waagen.\r\n\r\n_Derbya keokuk_ (Hall) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Dielasma bovidens_ (Morton) White.\r\n\r\n_Hustedia mormoni_ (Marcou) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Meekella striaticostata_ (Cox) White and St. John.\r\n\r\n_Orbiculoidea missouriensis_ (Shumard) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Productus cora_ d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\n_Productus costatus_ Sowerby? de Koninck.\r\n\r\n_Productus longispinus_ Sowerby?\r\n\r\n_Productus nebraskensis_ Owen.\r\n\r\n_Productus pertenuis_ Meek.\r\n\r\n_Productus punctatus_ (Martin) Morton.\r\n\r\n_Productus semireticulatus_ (Martin) d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\n_Reticularia perplexa_ (McChesney) Schuchert.\r\n\r\n_Seminula argentia_ (Shepard) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Spirifer cameratus_ Morton.\r\n\r\n_Spiriferina cristata_ (Schlotheim) Dawson.\r\n\r\n_Allorisma granosum_ (Shumard) Keyes.\r\n\r\n_Allorisma subcuneatum_ Meek and Hayden.\r\n\r\n_Astartella vera_ Hall.\r\n\r\n_Aviculopecten occidentalis_ (Shumard) Meek and Hayden.\r\n\r\n_Entolium aviculatum_ (Swallow) Meek.\r\n\r\n_Limopteria marian_ (White) Beede?\r\n\r\n_Macrodon_ Cf. _tenuistriatus_ Meek and Worthen.\r\n\r\n_Macrodon_ sp.\r\n\r\n_Myalina swallowi_ McChesney.\r\n\r\n_Pinna peracuta_ Shumard.\r\n\r\n_Schizodus curtus_ Meek and Worthen.\r\n\r\n_Schizodus curtiformis_ Wolcott.\r\n\r\n_Schizodus rossicus_ de Verneuil.\r\n\r\n_Aclisina swalloviana_ (Geinitz) Meek, and other gastropods too poorly\r\npreserved to be identified.\r\n\r\n_Bellerophon carbonarius_ Cox.\r\n\r\n_Orthoceras_ sp.\r\n\r\n_Griffithides scitula_ (Meek and Worthen) Vogdes.\r\n\r\n=26.= SEVERY SHALES. These shales are blue below, varying through yellow\r\nto black in places above the coal. They are fifty to seventy-five feet\r\nin thickness. The texture varies, and in the upper part they contain the\r\nOsage coal, which is mined at Topeka, Burlingame, Osage City, and other\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nIn correlating isolated sections the rocks between the Topeka limestone\r\nand the Barclay (= Burlingame = Wyckoff, etc.) limestone have been\r\nsomewhat confused. Under the title, “Stratigraphy of the Kansas Coal\r\nMeasures,”[5] Haworth describes them as follows: “Above them (Topeka\r\nlimestones) lies another shale bed fifty feet thick, at the top of which\r\nlies the Topeka coal, a seam about eleven inches thick, which has been\r\nmined in different places. The coal is immediately overlaid by two thin\r\nlimestone beds, separated by less than three feet of shales. Above the\r\nlimestone is the Osage City shale, more than 100 feet thick, at the top\r\nof which is the Osage coal, averaging eighteen or twenty inches\r\nthick.... Above the Osage coal is a thin limestone system [formation],\r\nsuperseded in turn by the Burlingame shales, a body about 150 feet thick\r\nin the vicinity of Burlingame, and possibly more in places. Both the\r\nBurlingame and Osage City shales extend for long distances to the\r\nsouthwest and northeast, and are important landmarks in stratigraphy.”\r\nBennett[6] describes the succession at Topeka correctly, but supposes\r\nthe coal above the Topeka coal corresponds to the Osage horizon, instead\r\nof to the one already indicated in this paper as its equivalent.\r\n\r\nHaworth’s statement in Vol. I, p. 162, of the Kansas Survey, is\r\npractically a repetition of the one just quoted, but he corrects the\r\ncorrelation of the coals in a foot-note at the bottom of page 161. In\r\nvolume III of the same reports (p. 94) he uses the term “Osage shales”\r\nfor all the shales between the Topeka limestone and the Barclay\r\nlimestone. The section is correctly given by Hall in his “Section from\r\nBoicourt to Alma,”[7] though it is not clear just what is meant by his\r\n“Osage City Shales, Coal, and Limestone.”\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing, it will be seen that the terms “Osage City” and\r\n“Burlingame,” when strictly applied, are proposed for one and the same\r\nset of rocks, namely, those above the Osage-Topeka coal, while the\r\nshales below the coal and above the Hartford limestone are not\r\ndesignated at all. Later, in Vol. III of the University Survey (p. 66),\r\nin quoting Doctor Adams’s notes, Professor Haworth gives the following:\r\n“_Severy Shales._—‘Above the Elk Falls limestone is a bed of shales\r\naveraging fifty to seventy-five feet in thickness, which, with the\r\nprotected limestones above, forms a light escarpment that may be traced\r\nfrom a few miles below Eureka to Cedar valley, forming a line from two\r\nto five miles west of the Elk Falls escarpment. This shale bed is\r\ntherefore sufficiently prominent to be recognized in the field, and to\r\nbe of considerable local and stratigraphic importance. The town of\r\nSevery lies within it, and therefore it may be called the Severy\r\nshales.’” Dr. George I. Adams, of the United States Geological Survey,\r\nunder whose direction the work of correlating the Coal Measures rocks of\r\nKansas was done last summer, informs me that the names used in this\r\npaper and accredited to him have been passed upon by the committee on\r\nnomenclature, and he has kindly permitted me to use them in advance.\r\n\r\nSo far as known these shales are not fossiliferous, save for a few\r\nfragments of fern leaves, below the coal, but are very fossiliferous\r\nlocally just above it.\r\n\r\n_Lophophyllum profundum_ (Milne-Edwards and Haime) Foerste.\r\n\r\n_Ceriocrinus craigi_ (Worthen) Wachsmuth and Springer.\r\n\r\n_Ceriocrinus harshbargeri_ Beede.\r\n\r\n_Ceriocrinus hemisphericus_ (Shumard) Wachsmuth and Springer. These\r\nthree species of crinoids are from the dump, and may be from the shales\r\nbetween the two layers of the Howard limestone above.\r\n\r\n_Spirorbis_ sp.\r\n\r\n_Fenestella dentata_ Rogers.\r\n\r\n_Fenestella limbata_ Foerste.\r\n\r\n_Fenestella mimica_ Ulrich.\r\n\r\n_Pinnatopora elliptica_ Rogers.\r\n\r\n_Polypora whitei_ Foerste.\r\n\r\n_Ambocœlia planoconvexa_ (Shumard) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Chonetes glaber_ Geinitz.\r\n\r\n_Chonetes granulifer_ Owen.\r\n\r\n_Derbya crassa_ (Meek and Hayden) Waagen.\r\n\r\n_Dielasma bovidens_ (Morton) White.\r\n\r\n_Hustedia mormoni_ (Marcou) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Lingula umbonata_ Cox. If this species is considered separate from _L.\r\nmytiloides_, the specimens here referred to would probably be classed\r\nwith the latter.\r\n\r\n_Productus cora_ d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\n_Productus longispinus_ Sowerby.\r\n\r\n_Productus nebraskensis_ Owen.\r\n\r\n_Productus pertenuis_ Meek.\r\n\r\n_Productus semireticulatus_ (Martin) d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\n_Productus symmetricus_ McChesney.\r\n\r\n_Pugnax utah_ (Marcou) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Reticularia perplexa_ (McChesney) Schuchert.\r\n\r\n_Seminula argentia_ (Shepard) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Spirifer cameratus_ Morton.\r\n\r\n_Spiriferina cristata_ (Schlotheim) Dawson.\r\n\r\n_Astartella vera_ Hall.\r\n\r\n_Aviculopecten occidentalis_ (Shumard) Meek and Hayden.\r\n\r\n_?

This consists of two thin layers of limestone\r\nseparated by two to ten feet of shales. The lower of these is a hard,\r\nblue limestone from twenty inches to two feet in thickness, quite\r\nfossiliferous in places, and sometimes quite full of crinoid stems and\r\nof fish teeth. The upper layer is usually coarser and more shaly. The\r\nclay between them is often very fossiliferous.\r\n\r\nFrom Doctor Adams’s notes, published by Professor Haworth,[8] it will be\r\nseen that the Howard limestone is the same as the rock over the Osage\r\ncoal, and that his Severy shale is the same as the Osage City shales.\r\n\r\nSome of the fossils here listed were collected from ballast near\r\nLawrence, on the old Carbondale railroad, which was taken from this\r\nlayer of rock at Carbondale.

(Adams, MSS., by permission of U. S. Geological\r\nSurvey.) Base of the Wabaunsee formation. For the present it seems best\r\nto group several strata in this formation.[9] They cannot well be mapped\r\non the scale of the U. S. folios, and they are also intimately connected\r\nfaunally, and usually all assist in producing a high escarpment with the\r\nupper part retreating. The rocks aggregate about seventy feet in\r\nthickness. The following section will serve to give an idea of these\r\nrocks:\r\n\r\n                                                                 ft. in.\r\n _g._ Gray, argillaceous, fossiliferous limestone, from 1 foot     2   0\r\n        to\r\n _f._ Bluish calcareous shales with _Enteletes_, _Myalina_,       20   0\r\n        _Allorisma_ and _Bellerophon_ fauna, from 8 feet to\r\n _e._ Hard, shelly, bluish limestone                               4   0\r\n _d._ Shales with thin limestones, varying from 21 feet to        40   0\r\n _c._ Hard gray limestone weathering light yellow, from 1½ feet    1   0\r\n        to\r\n _b._ Thin layer of shale                                          0   6\r\n _a._ Massive yellowish-gray limestone, very hard, with but few    6   0\r\n        fossils, from 4 to 7 feet thick, averaging about\r\n\r\nMost all of the fossils listed below are from layers _e_, _f_, and _g_,\r\nby far the greater part ranging through all three.\r\n\r\n_Somphospongia multiformis_ Beede (from Robinson, Brown county).\r\n\r\n_Aulacorhynchus millepunctatus_ (Meek and Worthen) Hall and Clarke?\r\n\r\n_Derbya crassa_ (Meek and Hayden) Waagen.\r\n\r\n_Dielasma bovidens_ (Morton) White.\r\n\r\n_Enteletes hemiplicata_ (Hall) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Meekella striaticostata_ (Cox) White and St. John.\r\n\r\n_Productus cora_ d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\n_Productus punctatus_ (Martin) Morton.\r\n\r\n_Seminula argentia_ (Shepard) Hall.\r\n\r\n_Allorisma costatum_ Meek and Worthen.\r\n\r\n_Allorisma geinitzi_ Meek.\r\n\r\n_Allorisma granosum_ (Shumard) Meek.\r\n\r\n_Allorisma subcuneatum_ Meek and Hayden.\r\n\r\n_Allorisma_ sp.\r\n\r\n_Aviculopecten occidentalis_ (Shumard) Meek and Hayden.\r\n\r\n_Edmondia aspenwallensis_ Meek.\r\n\r\n_Edmondia ovata_ Meek and Worthen.\r\n\r\n_Edmondia_ cf. _nebraskensis_ Meek.\r\n\r\n_Macrodon_ sp.\r\n\r\n_Myalina perattenuata_ Meek and Hayden.\r\n\r\n_Myalina subquadrata_ Shumard.\r\n\r\n_Pinna peracuta_ Shumard.\r\n\r\n_Pleurophorus_ sp.\r\n\r\n_Pseudomonotis kansasensis_ Beede.\r\n\r\n_Pseudomonotis hawni_ Meek and Hayden.\r\n\r\n_Pseudomonotis_ cf. _robusta_ Beede.\r\n\r\n_?

These shales are fifty-five feet thick in their\r\nthinnest exposure, and are thicker in some places. Bennett gives their\r\nthickness at Willard at from seventy-five to eighty-five feet, including\r\na thin stratum of limestone.[10] The Bennett collection contains the\r\nfollowing specimens taken from this thin limestone:\r\n\r\n_Fusulina secalica_ (Say) Fischer.\r\n\r\n_Meekella striaticostata_ (Cox) White and St. John.\r\n\r\n_Productus semireticulatus_ (Martin) d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\n_Bellerophon_ sp.\r\n\r\n=31.= CHOCOLATE LIMESTONE. This name, as well as the one preceding and\r\nthe one following, are used merely for convenience here, as they have\r\nbeen used before for the designation of these rocks, knowing that with\r\nfurther study and careful tracing they will be found to be the\r\nequivalents of similar rocks on the Neosho river section. This limestone\r\nis buff brown in color, varying from seven to ten feet in thickness,\r\ncomposed principally of two layers of massive stone, the upper of which\r\nis composed largely of the large variety of _Fusulina secalica_. In the\r\nKansas river region it always forms high escarpments with rocky edges.\r\nIt is not rich in any fossils except the _Fusulinas_.\r\n\r\n_Fusulina secalica_ (Say).\r\n\r\n_Lophophyllum profundum_ (Milne-Edwards and Haime) Foerste.\r\n\r\n_Chonetes granulifer_ Owen.\r\n\r\n_Enteletes hemiplicata_ (Hall) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Meekella striaticostata_ (Cox) White and St. John.\r\n\r\n_Productus cora_ d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\n_Productus nebraskensis_ Owen.\r\n\r\n_Seminula argentia_ (Shepard) Hall.\r\n\r\n=32.= Shales and sandstones shown near Dover, eighty-five feet in\r\nthickness, varying from light yellow to brownish red.\r\n\r\n=33.= DOVER LIMESTONE.

It is a matter of regret that the rocks of this part of the\r\nKansas river section cannot be referred with certainty to the\r\ncorresponding rocks of the Neosho river and Cottonwood river sections,\r\nwhich have been studied by various geologists. As near as I am able to\r\njudge, No. 13 of Bennett’s Buffalo Mound section[11] corresponds to the\r\nAmericus limestone near Emporia.[12] All the rocks between No. 35 and\r\nNo. 13 of Bennett’s Buffalo Mound section are put under No. 36. They\r\nconsist of an alternation of thin limestones and shales. These shales\r\nform a part, at least, of the “Olpe” shales of Dr. Geo. I. Adams (by\r\npermission, from his MSS.)\r\n\r\n=37.= No. 13 of Bennett’s Buffalo Mound section. Probably is the\r\nequivalent of the Americus limestone before mentioned.\r\n\r\n=38.= ELMDALE FORMATION. Prosser and Beede, MSS. Shales with occasional\r\nthin limestones, quite fossiliferous in the lower portion. This is\r\nprobably the same horizon as No. 2 and No. 3, except the limestone at\r\nthe top, of Prosser’s Manhattan section.[13] It is also, in all\r\nprobability, the same horizon as No. 8 of my section on the South Fork\r\nof the Black Vermillion river.[14] However, the fossils from the latter\r\nplace are given in a separate list. The thickness of these shales on the\r\nKansas river and Mill creek are from 111 to 118 feet. Grouping the Mill\r\ncreek and the Manhattan equivalents, we have the fossils of this horizon\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n_Fusulina secalica_ (Say).\r\n\r\n_Lophophyllum profundum_ (Milne-Edwards and Haime) Foerste.\r\n\r\n_Chætetes?_ sp.\r\n\r\n_Crinoid_ stems and plates.\r\n\r\n_Archæocidaris_ sp.\r\n\r\n_Archæocidaris_ sp.\r\n\r\n_Dichotrypa subramosa_ Rogers, MSS.\r\n\r\n_Fistulipora nodulifera_ Meek.\r\n\r\n_Rhombopora lepidodendroides_ Meek.\r\n\r\n_Septopora biserialis_ (Swallow) Foerste.\r\n\r\n_Ambocœlia planoconvexa_ (Shumard) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Chonetes glaber_ Geinitz.\r\n\r\n_Chonetes granulifer_ Owen.\r\n\r\n_Crania modesta_ White?\r\n\r\n_Derbya crassa_ (Meek and Hayden) Waagen.\r\n\r\n_Dielasma bovidens_ (Morton) White.\r\n\r\n_Enteletes hemiplicata_ (Hall) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Hustedia mormoni_ (Marcou) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Lingula umbonata_ Cox.\r\n\r\n_Meekella striaticostata_ (Cox) White and St. John.\r\n\r\n_Orbiculoidea manhattanensis_ (Meek and Hayden) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Productus cora_ d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\n_Productus longispinus_ Sowerby.\r\n\r\n_Productus nebraskensis_ Owen.\r\n\r\n_Productus semireticulatus_ (Martin) d’Orbigny.\r\n\r\n_Productus symmetricus_ McChesney.\r\n\r\n_Pugnax utah_ (Marcou) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Rhipidomella pecosi_ (Marcou) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Seminula argentia_ (Shepard) Hall and Clarke.\r\n\r\n_Spirifer cameratus_ Morton.\r\n\r\n_Spiriferina cristata_ (Schlotheim) Dawson.\r\n\r\n_Allorisma subcuneatum_ Meek and Hayden.\r\n\r\n_Aviculopecten occidentalis_ (Swallow) Meek and Hayden.\r\n\r\n_Nuculana bellistriata attenuata_ Meek var.\r\n\r\n_Dawsonella meeki_ Brady?
