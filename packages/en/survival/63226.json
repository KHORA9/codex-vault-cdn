There is a general tendency, however, for those\r\nengaged in combating flies to put too much dependence on the flytrap\r\nas a method of abating the nuisance. It should be borne in mind that\r\nflytrapping is only supplementary to other methods of control, most\r\nnotable of which is the prevention of breeding either by completely\r\ndisposing of breeding places or by treating the breeding material with\r\nchemicals.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that there are two main ways in which flytraps are\r\nvaluable: (1) By catching flies which come to clean premises from\r\nother places which are insanitary and (2) by capturing those flies\r\nwhich invariably escape in greater or less numbers the other means of\r\ndestruction which may be practiced. Furthermore, the number of flies\r\ncaught in traps serves as an index of the effectiveness of campaigns\r\nagainst breeding places.\r\n\r\n_Flytrapping should begin early in the spring if it is to be of greatest\r\nvalue._ Although comparatively few flies are caught in the early spring,\r\ntheir destruction means the prevention of the development of myriads of\r\nflies by midsummer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=KINDS OF FLIES CAUGHT.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe various species of flies which are commonly annoying about habitations\r\nor where foodstuffs are being prepared may be divided roughly into two\r\nclasses: (1) Those which breed in animal matter, consisting mainly of the\r\nso-called blowflies, including the screw-worm fly;[1] and (2) those which\r\nbreed in vegetable as well as in animal matter. In the latter group the\r\nhouse fly[2] is by far the most important. The stable fly is strictly a\r\nvegetable breeder, as are also certain other species which occasionally\r\ncome into houses and in rare cases may contaminate foodstuffs. The stable\r\nfly,[3] which breeds in cow manure or decaying vegetable matter, and the\r\nhorn fly,[4] which breeds in manure, are blood-sucking species, and can be\r\ncaught in ordinary flytraps in comparatively small numbers only. The kind\r\nof flies caught depends to a considerable extent on the material used for\r\nbait. In general the house fly and other species which breed in vegetable\r\nmatter are attracted to vegetable substances, while the blowflies will\r\ncome most readily to animal matter. This rule, of course, is not absolute,\r\nas flies are less restricted in feeding than in breeding habits, and, as\r\nis well known, the house fly is attracted to a greater or less extent to\r\nany moist material, especially if it has an odor.\r\n\r\n[1] _Chrysomyia macellaria_ Pab.\r\n\r\n[2] _Musca domestica_ L.\r\n\r\n[3] _Stomoxys calcitrans_ L.\r\n\r\n[4] _Lyperosia irritans_ L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=TYPES OF TRAPS.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same general principle is involved in nearly all flytraps in use,\r\nthough superficially they may appear quite different. The flies are\r\nattracted into a cage, as it were, by going through a passage the entrance\r\nof which is large and the exit small, so that there is little chance\r\nof the flies, once in, finding their way out again. This principle is\r\nmodified to fit different conditions. For instance, the window trap,\r\ndevised by Prof. C. F. Hodge, catches the flies as they endeavor to enter\r\nor leave a building; the garbage-can trap, for which Prof. Hodge is also\r\nto be credited, catches the flies that have entered garbage cans; and the\r\nmanure-box trap retains the flies bred from infested manure put into the\r\nbox.\r\n\r\nThe attractant used to induce flies to enter traps may consist of (1)\r\nfood, as in baited traps; (2) odors, as in window traps placed in windows\r\nfrom which odors are emitted; and (3) light, as in traps on manure boxes.\r\nOf course, light is an important factor in the success of all traps, for,\r\nas is well known, flies have a marked tendency to go toward the light, and\r\nthey usually enter the trap by flying toward the light after having been\r\nattracted beneath it by bait or after entering a room in search of food.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CONICAL TRAPS.=\r\n\r\nA number of traps of this general type are on the market, but most of\r\nthese are of small size. Nearly all are constructed with a dome instead of\r\na cone, and on this account the catching power is reduced about one-third.\r\nMoreover, the farmer, dairyman, or anyone with a few tools can construct\r\ntraps at a small fraction of the sale price of ready-made ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n=THE CONICAL HOOP TRAP.=\r\n\r\nA trap which appears from extensive tests made by Mr. E. W. Laake and the\r\nauthor to be best for effective trapping, durability, ease of construction\r\nand repair, and cheapness may be made as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Conical hoop flytrap, side view. _A_, Hoops\r\nforming frame at bottom. _B_, Hoops forming frame at top. _C_, Top of trap\r\nmade of barrel head. _D_, Strips around door. _E_, Door frame. _F_, Screen\r\non door. _G_, Buttons holding door. _H_, Screen on outside of trap. _I_,\r\nStrips on side of trap between hoops. _J_, Tips of these strips projecting\r\nto form legs, _K_. Cone. _L_, United edges of screen forming cone. _M_,\r\nAperture at apex of cone.]\r\n\r\nThe trap consists essentially of a screen cylinder with a frame made of\r\nbarrel hoops, in the bottom of which is inserted a screen cone. The height\r\nof the cylinder is 24 inches, the diameter 18 inches, and the cone is 22\r\ninches high, and 18 inches in diameter at the base. Material necessary\r\nfor this trap consists of four new or secondhand wooden barrel hoops, one\r\nbarrel head, four laths, 10 feet of strips 1 to 1½ inches wide by one-half\r\ninch thick (portions of old boxes will suffice), 61 linear inches of 12\r\nor 14 mesh galvanized screening 24 inches wide for the sides of the trap\r\nand 41 inches of screening 26 inches wide for the cone and door, an ounce\r\nof carpet tacks, and two turn-buttons, which may be made of wood. The\r\ntotal cost of the material for this trap, if all is bought new at retail\r\nprices, is about $1. In practically all cases, however, the barrel hoops,\r\nbarrel head, lath, and strips can be obtained without expense. This would\r\nreduce the cost to that of the wire and tacks, which would be 80 cents.\r\nIf a larger number of traps are constructed at one time, the cost is\r\nconsiderably reduced.\r\n\r\nOne of these traps is illustrated in figures 1 and 2. In constructing the\r\ntrap two of the hoops are bent in a circle (18 inches in diameter on the\r\ninside), and nailed together, the ends being trimmed to give a close fit.\r\nThese form the bottom of the frame (_A_), and the other two, prepared in\r\na similar way, the top (_B_). The top (_C_) of the trap is made of an\r\nordinary barrel head with the bevel edge sawed off sufficiently to cause\r\nthe head to fit closely in the hoops and allow secure nailing. A square,\r\n10 inches on the side, is cut out of the center of the top to form a door.\r\nThe portions of the top (barrel head) are held together by inch strips\r\n(_D_) placed around the opening one-half inch from the edge to form a\r\njamb for the door. The door consists of a narrow frame (_E_) covered with\r\nscreen (_F_) well fitted to the trap and held in place (not hinged) by\r\nbuttons (_G_). The top is then nailed in the upper hoops and the sides\r\n(_H_) formed by closely tacking screen wire on the outside of the hoops.\r\nFour laths (_I_) (or light strips) are nailed to the hoops on the outside\r\nof the trap to act as supports between the hoops, and the ends are allowed\r\nto project 1 inch at the bottom to form legs (_J_). The cone (_K_) is cut\r\nfrom the screen and either sewed with fine wire or soldered where the\r\nedges meet at (_L_), or a narrow lath may be nailed along these edges.\r\nThe apex of the cone is then cut off to give an aperture (_M_) 1 inch in\r\ndiameter. It is then inserted in the trap and closely tacked to the hoop\r\naround the base.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Conical hoop flytrap, top view. Letters designate\r\nparts as in figure 1.]\r\n\r\nThe construction of a cone of any given height or diameter is quite simple\r\nif the following method be observed. It is best to cut a pattern from a\r\nlarge piece of heavy paper, cardboard, or tin, Figure 3 illustrates the\r\nmethod of laying out a cone of the proper dimensions for the above trap.\r\nAn ordinary square is placed on the material from which the pattern is to\r\nbe cut; a distance (22 inches) equal to the height of the cone is laid\r\noff on one leg of the square at _A_, and a distance (9 inches) equal to\r\none-half of the diameter of the base of the cone is laid off on the other\r\nleg at _B_, and a line is drawn between the points _A_ and _B_. With the\r\ndistance between these points as a radius and with the point _A_ as a\r\ncenter, the portion of a circle, _C D_, is drawn. With a pair of dividers,\r\nthe legs of which are set 1 inch apart, or with the square, lay off as\r\nmany inches on the arc _C D_, starting at _C_, as there are inches around\r\nthe base of the cone, which in this case is about 56½ inches, reaching\r\nnearly to the point _E_. Then add one-half inch for the lapping of the\r\nedges of the cone, and one-half inch which is taken up when the cone is\r\ntacked in, thus making a total distance from _C_ to _E_ of 57½ inches.\r\nDraw a line from _A_ to _C_ and another from _A_ to _E_, and cut out the\r\npattern on these lines and on the arc from _C_ to as shown in figure\r\n3. The edges _AC_ and _AE_ are then brought together, lapped one-half\r\ninch, and sewed with wire or soldered. After the aperture of the cone is\r\nformed by cutting off the apex, as previously described, it is ready for\r\ninsertion in the trap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Method of laying out a pattern for the\r\nconstruction of a cone. Cut out on curved line _C_ to _E_ and on dotted\r\nlines from _A_ to _C_ and _A_ to _E_.]\r\n\r\nIn order to figure the distance around the base of a cone of any given\r\ndiameter multiply the diameter by 3.1416 or 3-1/7.\r\n\r\nThe height of the legs of the trap, the height of the cone, and the size\r\nof the aperture in the top of the cone, each are of importance in securing\r\nthe greatest efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n=OTHER FORMS OF CONICAL TRAPS.=\r\n\r\nA modification of the previously described trap has been made by Mr. D. C.\r\nParman of the Bureau of Entomology. The principal point of advantage in\r\nthis type is that it can be made more quickly and with fewer tools. The\r\nprinciples and dimensions are the same, the most striking difference being\r\nthe absence of a wooden top. A single hoop with the thick edge down forms\r\nthe upper frame of the cylinder and the entire top is made of screen.\r\nA circular piece of screen with a diameter about 3 inches greater than\r\nthe diameter of the cylinder is cut; a hoop with a diameter equal to the\r\ninside of the top of the trap is then made of heavy wire and laid upon the\r\ndisk of screen and the edges of the screen bent in over it. By folding in\r\nand crimping the edges of the wire over the wire hoop it will remain in\r\nposition without difficulty and the edges of the screen disk are used to\r\nlift the top of the trap out for emptying flies. It is important to have\r\nthe screen top fit the inside of the cylinder very snugly at all points.\r\nIf there is any space left where flies can escape it is a good plan to\r\nbind the edge of the top with a strip of burlap. This not only helps\r\nto close the openings but keeps the hoop in place and aids in removing\r\nthe top. Another difference is that the screen forming the sides of the\r\ncylinder is placed on the inside of the hoops and legs, the frame being\r\nbuilt first and then the cylinder formed by tacking the wire on the inside\r\nof the hoops and nailing in along the upright strips and against the wire\r\nshort pieces of laths with their upper ends against the lower edge of the\r\nhoop forming the top of the trap and extending downward along the legs\r\nabout two-thirds of their length. These strips hold the wire in place and\r\ngive rigidity to the trap, and they are thick enough to project beyond the\r\ninner surface of the hoop and form a support upon which the edges of the\r\nscreen top rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Tent flytrap. When the trap is set up the screen\r\nbox. _A_, fits on the base, _B_, and two pans of bait are placed beneath\r\nthe tent. _C_, Hole in screen at apex of tent.]\r\n\r\nConical traps with steel frames are satisfactory, but they are less easily\r\nrescreened. These, of course, can be constructed only by shops with\r\nconsiderable equipment. Traps constructed with a wooden disk about the\r\nbase of the cone, and a similar disk around the top to serve as a frame,\r\nor those with a square wooden frame at the bottom and top, with strips up\r\nthe corners, are fairly satisfactory. It should be borne in mind that the\r\nfactor which determines the number of flies caught is the diameter of the\r\nbase of the cone, if other things are equal. Therefore the space taken up\r\nby the wooden framework is largely wasted, and if it is too wide it will\r\nhave a deterrent effect on the flies which come toward the bait. For this\r\nreason it is advisable that the wood around the base of the cone should be\r\nas narrow as consistent with strength--usually about 3 inches.\r\n\r\n_Under no condition should the sides or top of the trap be of solid\r\nmaterial_, as the elimination of light from the top or sides has been\r\nfound to decrease the catch from 50 to 75 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=TENT TRAPS.=\r\n\r\nThe tent form of trap has been widely advocated in this country, but\r\nrecent experiments indicate that it is much less efficient than the cone\r\ntrap, and usually as difficult to construct and almost as expensive. The\r\nsize of these traps may vary considerably, but one constructed according\r\nto the dimensions given in figure 4 will be found most convenient. The\r\nheight of the tent should be about equal to the width of the base, and the\r\nholes (_C_) along the apex of the tent should be one-half to three-fourths\r\nof an inch in diameter and 1 inch apart. The box (_A_) should be provided\r\nwith hooks to pass through the eyes on the base (_B_). Small blocks 1 inch\r\nthick are nailed beneath the corners of the tent frame to serve as legs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=GARBAGE-CAN TRAPS.=\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned. Prof. Hodge has adapted the cone trap to use on\r\nthe lids of garbage cans. It is not advisable to use this trap except\r\nwhere garbage cans are sufficiently open to admit flies. In such cases a\r\nhole may be cut in the lid of the can and one of the small balloon traps\r\nwhich are obtainable on the market attached over the hole. To make the\r\ntrap effective the edges of this lid should extend well down over the top\r\nof the can. The lid should be held up slightly so as to allow the flies\r\nto pass under, but not high enough to admit direct light. Practically\r\nspeaking, the garbage forms the bait for this trap, and when inside the\r\ncan the flies are attracted to the light admitted through the trap. It\r\nis really advisable to have the garbage cans fly proof, so as to prevent\r\ndanger of fly breeding within them rather than to depend on traps on the\r\nlids, which necessarily allow odors to escape. A garbage can with a trap\r\nattached is illustrated in figure 5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Top of garbage can with small balloon flytrap\r\nattached.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=MANURE-BOX TRAPS.=\r\n\r\nManure pits or boxes are desirable for the temporary storage of manure,\r\nespecially in towns and cities. These have been widely advocated, but the\r\ndifficulty has been that manure often becomes infested before it is put\r\ninto them, and flies frequently breed out before the boxes are emptied and\r\noften escape through the cracks. To obviate these difficulties a manure\r\nbox or pit, with a modified tent trap or cone trap attached, is desirable.\r\nMr. Arthur Swaim, of Florida, has devised a form of manure trap consisting\r\nof a series of screen tents with exit holes along the ridges of these,\r\nover which is a screen box. The latter retains the flies as they pass\r\nthrough the holes in the tents. The entire trap is removable.\r\n\r\nIn order to retain the fertilizing value of manure to the greatest extent\r\nit is advisable to exclude the air from it as much as possible and to\r\nprotect it from the leaching action of rains. This being the case, there\r\nis really no necessity to cover a large portion of the top of the box with\r\na trap, but merely to have holes large enough to attract flies to the\r\nlight, and cover these holes with ordinary conical traps, with the legs\r\ncut off, so the bottom of the trap will fit closely to the box. The same\r\narrangement can be made where manure is kept in a pit. In large bins two\r\nor more holes covered with traps should be provided for the escape of the\r\nflies.\r\n\r\nManure boxes should be used by all stock owners in towns and cities, and\r\nthey are also adaptable to farms. The size of the manure bin should be\r\ngoverned by the individual needs, but for use on the farm it is desirable\r\nto make it large enough to hold all of the manure produced during the\r\nbusiest season of the year. A box 14 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 4 feet\r\ndeep will hold the manure produced by two horses during about five months.\r\nAbout 2 cubic feet of box space should be allowed for each horse per day.\r\nThe bin should be made of concrete or heavy plank. When the latter is used\r\nthe cracks should be battened to prevent the escape of flies. The bin may\r\nhave a floor or it may be set in the ground several inches and the dirt\r\nclosely banked around the outside. For the admission of the manure a\r\ngood-sized door should be provided in either end of a large bin. A portion\r\nof the top should be made easily removable for convenience in emptying the\r\nbox, or one entire end of the box may be hinged. On account of the danger\r\nof the door being left open through carelessness, it is advisable to\r\narrange a lift door which can be opened by placing the foot on a treadle\r\nas the manure is shoveled in. The door should be heavy enough to close\r\nautomatically when the treadle is released. A manure bin with flytrap\r\nattached is shown in figure 6.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Use of flytrap in connection with manure bin. _A_,\r\nBlock of wood set in ground to which lever raising door is hinged.]\r\n\r\nAttention is directed to a maggot trap devised by Mr. R. H. Hutchison, as\r\ndescribed in Farmers' Bulletin 851 of the Department of Agriculture. Where\r\nlarge quantities of manure are produced on a farm this method of storing\r\nthe manure on a platform and trapping the maggots which breed out may be\r\nmore convenient than the manure bin.\r\n\r\n\r\n=WINDOW TRAPS.=\r\n\r\nProf. C. F. Hodge has designed a trap which is really a modified tent\r\ntrap adapted to use in a window. This trap is constructed so as to catch\r\nthe flies as they enter or leave through the window. It is adaptable to\r\nbarns which are fairly free from cracks or other places where flies may\r\nenter. It may also be used on windows of buildings where foodstuffs are\r\nprepared and where flies endeavor to enter through the windows or escape\r\nafter having gained entrance through other passageways. All openings not\r\nprovided with traps should be closely screened, and on large buildings\r\ntraps may be installed in every third window.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Hodge type window trap. At left, trap with end\r\nremoved to show construction; at right, cross section of trap placed in\r\na window. _A_, End of trap. _B_, Upper side of folds in screen. _C_,\r\nLower side of folds in screen. _D_, Portion of end of trap sawed out and\r\nreturned after attaching screen. _E_, Holes along apex of folds. _F_, Door\r\nfor removing dead flies. _G_, Window sill. _H_, Upper window sash. _I_,\r\nInside entrance for flies. _O_, Outside entrances.]\r\n\r\nThis trap is essentially a screen box closely fitted to the frame of a\r\nwindow (see fig. 7). The thickness of the box at _A_ should be about 12\r\ninches. Instead of the screen running straight down over the box on either\r\nside it is folded inward nearly to the center of the frame in =V=-shaped\r\nfolds running longitudinally across the window. One, two, or even more\r\nfolds may be made in the screen on either side. The upper side of the fold\r\n_B_ should extend toward the center almost at right angles with the side\r\nof the trap--that is, parallel with the top and bottom; and the lower side\r\n_C_ should slant downward as shown in the drawing. The sides of the frame\r\nmay be cut out at the proper angle and the pieces _D_ returned after the\r\nscreen has been tacked along the edges. Along the apex (inner edge) of\r\neach fold is punched a series of holes _E_ about one-half inch in diameter\r\nand 1 inch apart. The apices of the folds on either side of the window\r\nshould not be directly opposite. A narrow door _F_ opening downward on\r\nhinges should be made on one side of the trap at the bottom for removal of\r\nthe dead flies. The entire trap is fastened to the window by hooks so that\r\nit may be readily taken off. An additional trapping feature may be added\r\nby providing a tent trap fitted in the bottom of the box. A narrow slit is\r\nleft along the base to allow the flies to enter beneath the tent. Bait\r\nmay be placed under the tent to attract the flies.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that the use of these window traps will aid in\r\nprotecting animals in barns from stable flies and mosquitoes, and in\r\nsome cases horseflies and other noxious species are caught. They tend to\r\nexclude the light, however, and are somewhat cumbersome, especially in\r\nthin-walled buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=TRAPPING THE SCREW-WORM FLY.=[5]\r\n\r\n[5] _Chrysomyia macellaria_ Fab.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent efforts to reduce the loss to the live-stock industry of the\r\nSouthwest resulting from the ravages of the screw-worm have directed\r\nattention to the employment of flytraps in this work.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of the importance of preventing the breeding of\r\nflies as a prerequisite to effective control. This is equally true of the\r\nscrew-worm and other blowflies, which attack animals, and of the house\r\nfly. In the case of these blowflies main dependence must be placed on the\r\ncomplete and prompt burning of all carcasses and animal refuse.\r\n\r\nExperiments conducted in the range sections of Texas indicate that traps\r\nproperly baited and set are of material aid in preventing screw-worm\r\ninjury to live stock. It is advised that at least one trap be maintained\r\non each section of land. These should be located preferably near watering\r\nplaces and where cattle congregate, especially in the so-called \"hospital\r\ntraps,\" where the screw-worm-infested animals are kept for treatment.\r\n\r\nThe conical-type traps as described are advised. The traps should be set\r\non a board platform about 2 feet square, securely fastened to a tree or\r\non a post where the trap and bait will be the least disturbed by stock or\r\nwild animals.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter half of one season over 100 gallons of flies, the vast\r\nmajority of which were screw-worm flies, were captured in about 25 traps\r\noperated on a ranch in west Texas.\r\n\r\nThe question of the baits best adapted for this species and other points\r\nin regard to the operation of the traps are briefly discussed under\r\nsubsequent headings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=BAITS FOR TRAPS.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of selecting the best bait for flies is an important one.\r\nIn choosing a bait it should be remembered that it is largely the\r\nfermentation which renders the material attractive, and that baits are\r\nmost attractive during their most active period of fermentation. As has\r\nbeen indicated, the kind of bait used should be governed by the species of\r\nflies the destruction of which is desired. This is most often the house\r\nfly.\r\n\r\nExperiments conducted indicate that a mixture of cheap cane molasses\r\n(\"black-strap\") and water is among the most economical and effective baits\r\nfor the house fly. One part of molasses is mixed with three parts of\r\nwater. The attractiveness becomes marked on the second or third day.\r\n\r\nSugar-beet or \"stock molasses,\" which is very cheap, especially in regions\r\nwhere produced, when mixed in the foregoing proportions, is fairly\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\nOn dairy farms, probably milk is the next choice as a bait to\r\ncane-molasses solution, considering its convenience. The curd from milk,\r\nwith about one-half pound of brown sugar added to each pound and water\r\nto make it thoroughly moist, is a very good bait and continues to be\r\nattractive for 10 days or more if kept moist. A mash of bran made quite\r\nthin with a mixture of equal parts of water and milk and with a few\r\ntablespoonfuls of brown sugar and cornstarch and a yeast cake added makes\r\nan attractive and lasting bait. During hot weather stirring the old bait\r\nor adding fresh is a daily necessity if best results are to be secured.\r\n\r\nSirup made by dissolving 1 part of ordinary brown sugar in 4 parts\r\nof water and allowing the mixture to stand a day or two to induce\r\nfermentation is almost equal to the molasses and water as a fly bait. If\r\nit is desirable to use the sirup immediately after making it, a small\r\namount of vinegar should be added. Honeybees are sometimes caught in\r\nlarge numbers at this bait. When this happens some of the other baits\r\nrecommended should be used.\r\n\r\nWith the baits before mentioned comparatively few blowflies will be\r\ncaught. For use about slaughterhouses, butcher shops, and other places\r\nwhere blowflies are troublesome, it has been determined that the mucous\r\nmembranes which form the lining of the intestines of cattle or hogs are\r\nwithout equal as a bait. This material, which is commonly spoken of as\r\n\"gut slime,\" can be obtained from packing houses where sausage casings are\r\nprepared. The offensive odor of this bait renders its use undesirable very\r\nnear habitations or materials intended for human consumption.\r\n\r\nFor use under range conditions experiments are underway with dried gut\r\nslime. This material is giving satisfaction as a screw-worm fly attractant\r\nand is easily carried, being in a highly concentrated form. The flaky\r\nmaterial is placed in the bait pans and water added at the rate of 1 part\r\nslime to 10 or 20 parts water, after which the mixture is thoroughly\r\nstirred.\r\n\r\nAnother packing-house product known as blood tankage is a good fly bait\r\nwhen used with molasses and water. This combination results in the capture\r\nof a large percentage of house flies. Where these materials are not\r\nobtainable fairly good catches will result from the use of fish scraps\r\nor meat scraps. With any of these baits the catches will be found not to\r\nbe entirely meat-infesting flies, as actual counts have shown that the\r\npercentage of house flies in traps over such baits ranges from 45 to 75.\r\n\r\nOverripe or fermenting fruit, such as watermelon rinds or crushed\r\nbananas, placed in the bait pans sometimes gives satisfactory results.\r\nA combination of overripe bananas with milk is much more attractive than\r\neither one used separately. A considerable number of blowflies as well as\r\nhouse flies are attracted to such baits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=BAIT CONTAINERS.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe size of the bait container in relation to the size of the trap is\r\na very important consideration. It has been found that a small pan\r\nor deep pan of bait set in the center under a trap will catch only a\r\nsmall fraction of the number of flies secured by using larger, shallow\r\ncontainers. The best and most convenient pan for baits is a shallow\r\ncircular tin, such as the cover of a lard bucket. Under range conditions\r\nit is advisable to use a more substantial bait pan and preferably one 1½\r\ninches deep, so that a greater amount of bait may be used, thus preventing\r\ncomplete drying out between visits to the trap. Its diameter should be\r\nabout 4 inches less than that of the base of the trap, thus bringing the\r\nedge within 2 inches of the outside edge of the trap. For liquid baits\r\nthe catch can be increased slightly by placing a piece of sponge or a few\r\nchips in the center of the bait pan to provide additional surface upon\r\nwhich the flies may alight. The same kind of pans for bait may be used\r\nunder tent traps. Two or more pans should be used, according to the length\r\nof the trap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=CARE AND LOCATION OF TRAPS.=\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many cases flytrapping has been rendered ineffectual by the fact that\r\nthe traps were not properly cared for. In setting traps a location should\r\nbe chosen where flies naturally congregate. This is usually on the sunny\r\nside of a building out of the wind. It is exceedingly important that the\r\nbait containers be kept well filled. This usually requires attention\r\nevery other day. The bait pans should be washed out at rather frequent\r\nintervals. This gives a larger catch and avoids the danger of flies\r\nbreeding in the material used for bait. Further, it should be borne in\r\nmind that traps can not be operated successfully throughout the season\r\nwithout emptying them. Where flies are abundant and the bait pans are\r\nproperly attended to the traps should be emptied at weekly intervals.\r\nWhere flies become piled high against the side of the cone the catching\r\npower of the trap is considerably reduced. The destruction of the flies\r\nis best accomplished by immersing the trap in hot water or, still better,\r\nwhere a tight barrel is at hand place a few live coals in a pan on the\r\nground, scatter two tablespoonfuls of sulphur over them, place the trap\r\nover the coals, and turn the barrel over the trap. All of the flies will\r\nbe rendered motionless in about five minutes. They may then be killed\r\nby using hot water, throwing them into a fire, or burying them. In the\r\noperation of flytraps in controlling the screw-worm it has not been found\r\nnecessary, especially during hot weather, to kill the flies, as they die\r\nvery rapidly within the traps. In order to empty a trap it may be inverted\r\nand the dead flies shaken down. As the living flies will naturally go\r\nupward, the door may then be removed and the dead flies shaken out, the\r\ndoor replaced, and the trap set upright without loss of many of the living\r\nflies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=STICKY FLY PAPERS.=\r\n\r\n\r\nSticky fly papers are of some value in destroying flies which have\r\ngained access to houses, but they have marked limitations and numerous\r\nobjectionable features. For use out of doors traps are much more effective\r\nand economical.\r\n\r\nDr. Crumbine, of the Kansas State Board of Health, gives the following\r\nmethod for preparing fly paper:\r\n\r\n\"Take 2 pounds of rosin and 1 pint of castor oil, heat together until it\r\nlooks like molasses. Take an ordinary paint brush and smear while hot on\r\nany kind of paper--an old newspaper is good--and place several about the\r\nroom. A dozen of these may be made at a cost of 1 cent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=POISONED BAITS.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of destruction of flies with poisons is somewhat out of place\r\nhere, but the close relationship of poisoned baits to trapping warrants a\r\nbrief statement.\r\n\r\nProbably the best poisoned bait for house flies is formaldehyde in milk\r\nused at the rate of about two teaspoonfuls of formaldehyde to a pint of a\r\nmixture of equal parts of milk and water. This is placed in flat dishes\r\nin places frequented by flies. A piece of bread or a sponge in the dish\r\nadds to the effectiveness. Brown sugar or molasses and water with 2½ per\r\ncent formaldehyde (commercial, 40 per cent solution) added will probably\r\nalso give satisfactory results. As far as possible other liquids should be\r\nremoved when poisoned baits are exposed.\r\n\r\nThe use of poison solutions, especially arsenical solution in tubs\r\ncontaining portions of animal carcasses, has been tried and advocated\r\nagainst the screw-worm by a number of stockmen. A comparatively weak\r\npoison solution--about 1 gallon of dip, diluted for use on cattle, to 7\r\ngallons of water--is sufficient. Best results usually have been secured\r\nwhere a considerable portion of the animal matter was allowed to protrude\r\nfrom the poison solution, as there is a tendency for the solution\r\nto harden the bait and prevent its decomposition, thus reducing its\r\nattraction for flies.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CAUTION.=\r\n\r\n=It should be borne in mind that formaldehyde, 40 per cent, is poison\r\nabout in the same proportion as wood alcohol, if taken internally. It\r\nshould not be inhaled, nor should the eyes be unduly exposed to it.\r\nSpecial pains should be taken to prevent children from drinking poisoned\r\nbaits and to prevent the poisoned flies from dropping into foods or\r\ndrinks. Arsenical solutions, as is well known, are extremely poisonous to\r\nman and animals. Care should be taken to protect the poisoned baits from\r\nlire stock and it is not advisable to have the baits close to barnyards\r\nwhere fowls are kept, as they may be poisoned by eating the dead flies.=\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber Note\r\n\r\nMinor typos have been corrected.
