The piling is left in permanently if it is not\r\nwanted again for use.\r\n\r\nSometimes these bottoms are too soft to be treated in this manner; in\r\nthat case boxes or caissons are formed, loaded with stone and sunk into\r\nplace with pig iron until the weight they are to carry is approximated.\r\nWhen settled, the weights are removed and building begins.\r\n\r\nFoundations on shifting sand are met with in banks of streams, which\r\nswell and become rapids as each winter breaks up. This kind is most\r\ntroublesome and dangerous to rest upon if not properly treated.\r\n\r\nRetaining walls are frequently built season after season, and as\r\nregularly become undermined by the scouring of the water. Regular\r\ndocking with piles and timbers is resorted to, but it is so expensive\r\nfor small works that it is not often tried.\r\n\r\nFoundations are formed often with rock well planted out; and again\r\nsuccess has attended the use of bags of sand where rough rock was not\r\nconvenient or too expensive.\r\n\r\nIn such cases it is well to try a mattress foundation, which may be\r\nformed of brushwood and small saplings with butts from ½ inch to\r\n2½ inches in diameter, compressed into bundles from 8 to 12 inches\r\ndiameter, and from 12 to 16 feet long, and well tied with ropes every\r\nfour feet. Other bundles, from 4 to 6 inches diameter and 16 feet long,\r\nare used as binders, and these bundles are now cross-woven and make a\r\ngood network, the long parts protruding and making whip ends. One or\r\nmore sets of netting are used as necessity seems to require. This kind\r\nof foundation may be filled in with a concrete of hydraulic cement and\r\nsand, and the walls built on them with usual footings, and it is very\r\ndurable, suiting the purpose as well as anything we have seen or heard\r\nof.--_Inland Architect_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFT BRIDGE OVER THE OURCQ CANAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis bridge, which was inaugurated in 1868, was constructed under the\r\ndirection of Mr. Mantion, then engineer-in-chief of the Belt Railway.\r\nFig. 1 shows the bridge raised.\r\n\r\nThe solution adopted in this case was the only feasible one that\r\npresented itself, in view of the slight difference between the level\r\nof the railway tracks and the maximum plane of the canal water. This\r\ncircumstance did not even permit of a thought of an ordinary revolving\r\nbridge, since this, on a space of 10 inches being reserved between the\r\nlevel of the water and the bottom of the bridge, and on giving the\r\nlatter a minimum thickness of 33 inches up to the level of the rails,\r\nwould have required the introduction into the profile of the railroad\r\nof approaches of at least one-quarter inch gradient, that would have\r\ninterfered with operations at the station close by.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--LIFT BRIDGE OVER THE OURCQ CANAL.]\r\n\r\nBesides, in the case of a revolving bridge, since the bottom of the\r\nlatter would be but ten inches above the water level, and the rollers\r\nwould have to be of larger diameter than that, it would have been\r\nnecessary to suppose the roller channel placed beneath the level of the\r\nwater, and it would consequently have been necessary to isolate this\r\nchannel from the canal by a tight wall. The least fissure in the latter\r\nwould have inundated the channel.\r\n\r\nAs the Ourcq Canal had no regular period of closing, it was necessary\r\nto construct the bridge without hinderance to navigation. The idea of\r\naltering the canal's course could not be thought of, for the proximity\r\nof the fortifications and of the bridge over the military road was\r\nopposed to it. Moreover, the canal administration insisted upon a free\r\nwidth of 26 feet, which is that of the sluices of the St. Denis Canal,\r\nand which would have led to the projection of a revolving bridge of 28\r\nfeet actual opening in order to permit of building foundations with\r\ncaissons in such a way as to leave a passageway of 26 feet during\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons it was decided to construct a metallic bridge that\r\nshould be lifted by means of counterpoises and balanced after the manner\r\nof gasometers.\r\n\r\nThe free width secured to navigation is 28 feet. The bridge is usually\r\nkept raised to a height of 16 feet above the level of the water in order\r\nto allow boats to pass (Fig. 2). In this position it is balanced by four\r\ncounterpoises suspended from the extremities of chains that pass over\r\npulleys. These counterpoises are of cast iron, and weigh, altogether,\r\n44,000 pounds--the weight of the bridge to be balanced, say 11,000\r\npounds per counterpoise. Moreover, each of the four chains is prolonged\r\nbeneath the corresponding counterpoise by a chain of the same weight,\r\ncalled a compensating chain.\r\n\r\nThe pulleys, B and C, that support the suspension chains have\r\nprojections in their channels which engage with the links and thus\r\nprevent the chains from slipping. They are mounted at the extremity of\r\nfour latticed girders that likewise carry girder pulleys, D. The pulleys\r\nthat are situated at the side of the bridge are provided laterally\r\nwith a conical toothing which gears with a pinion connected with the\r\nmaneuvering apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe two pinions of the same side of the bridge are keyed to a\r\nlongitudinal shaft which is set in motion at one point of its length by\r\na system of gearings. The winch upon which is exerted the stress that\r\nis to effect the lifting or the descent of the bridge is fixed upon the\r\nshaft of the pinion of the said gearing, which is also provided with a\r\nflywheel, c. The longitudinal shafts are connected by a transverse one.\r\ne, which renders the two motions interdependent. This transverse shaft\r\nis provided with collars, against which bear stiff rods that give it the\r\naspect of an elongated spindle, and that permit it to resist twisting\r\nstresses.\r\n\r\nThe windlasses that lift the bridge are actuated by manual power. Two\r\nmen (or even one) suffice to do the maneuvering.\r\n\r\nThis entire collection of pulleys and mechanism is established upon two\r\nbrick foot bridges between which the bridge moves. These arched bridges\r\noffer no obstruction to navigation. Moreover, they always allow free\r\npassage to foot passengers, whatever be the position of the bridge. They\r\nare provided with four vertical apertures to the right of the suspension\r\nchains, in order to allow of the passage of the latter. The girders that\r\nsupport the pulleys rest at one extremity upon the upper part of the\r\nbridges, and at the other upon solid brick pillars with stone caps.\r\n\r\nFinally, in order to render the descent of the bridge easier, there are\r\nadded to it two water tanks that are filled from the station reservoir\r\nwhen the bridge is in its upper position, and that empty themselves\r\nautomatically as soon as it reaches the level of the railroad tracks.\r\n\r\nA very simple system of fastening has been devised for keeping the\r\nbridge in a stationary position when raised. When it reaches the end of\r\nits upward travel, four bolts engage with an aperture in the suspension\r\nrod and prevent it from descending. These bolts are set in motion by\r\ntwo connecting rods carried by a longitudinal shaft and maneuvered by a\r\nlever at the end of the windlass.\r\n\r\nAt the lower part the bridge rests upon iron plates set into sills. It\r\nis guided in its descent longitudinally by iron plates that have an\r\ninclination which is reproduced at the extremities of the bridge\r\ngirders, and transversely by two inclined angle irons into which fit the\r\nexternal edges of the bottoms of the extreme girders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--ELEVATION AND PLAN.]\r\n\r\nThe total weight of the bridge is, as we have said, 44,000 pounds, which\r\nis much less than would have been that of a revolving bridge of the same\r\nspan. The maneuvering of the bridge is performed with the greatest ease\r\nand requires about two minutes.\r\n\r\nThis system has been in operation at the market station of La Vilette\r\nsince the year 1868, and has required but insignificant repairs. We\r\nthink the adoption of it might be recommended for all cases in which a\r\nslight difference between the level of a railroad and that of a water\r\ncourse would not permit of the establishment of a revolving bridge.--_Le\r\nGenie Civil_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nST. PETERSBURG A SEAPORT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and Empress of Russia, on Wednesday, May 27. 1885, the\r\nsecond anniversary of their coronation at Moscow, opened the Maritime\r\nCanal, in the Bay of Cronstadt, the shallow upper extremity of the Gulf\r\nof Finland, by which great work the city of St. Petersburg is made a\r\nseaport as much as London. St. Petersburg, indeed, stands almost on the\r\nsea shore, at the very mouth of the Neva, though behind several low\r\nislands which crowd the head of the Gulf; and though this is an inland\r\nsea without saltness or tides, it is closed by ice in winter. Seventeen\r\nmiles to the west is the island of Cronstadt, a great fortress, with\r\nnaval dockyards and arsenals for the imperial fleet, and with a spacious\r\nharbor for ships of commerce. The navigable entrance channel up the\r\nBay of Cronstadt to the mouth of the Neva lies under the south side of\r\nCronstadt, and is commanded by its batteries. As the bay eastward has a\r\ndepth not exceeding 12 ft., and the depth of the Neva at its bar is but\r\n9 ft., all large vessels have been obliged hitherto to discharge their\r\ncargoes at Cronstadt, to be there transferred to lighters and barges\r\nwhich brought the goods up to the capital. \"The delay and expense of\r\nthis process,\" says Mr. William Simpson, our special artist, \"will be\r\nunderstood by stating that a cargo might be brought from England by a\r\nsteamer in a week, but it would take three weeks at least to transport\r\nthe same cargo from Cronstadt to St. Petersburg. Of course, much of this\r\ntime was lost by custom house formalities. Sometimes it has taken even\r\nlonger than is here stated, which made the delivery of goods at St.\r\nPetersburg a matter of great uncertainty, thus rendering time contracts\r\nalmost an impossibility. This state of things had continued from the\r\ntime of Peter the Great, and his great scheme had never been fully\r\nrealized. The increase of commerce and shipping had long made this a\r\ncrying evil; but even with all these difficulties, the trade here has\r\nbeen rapidly growing. A scheme to bring the shipping direct to the\r\ncapital had thus become almost a necessity. As Manchester wishes to\r\nbring the ocean traffic to her doors without the intervention of\r\nLiverpool, so St. Petersburg desired to have its steamers sailing up to\r\nthe city, delivering and loading their cargoes direct at the stores and\r\nwarehouses in her streets. If Glasgow had not improved the Clyde, and\r\nhad up to the present day to bring up all goods carried by her ocean\r\ngoing steamers from Port Glasgow--a place constructed for that purpose\r\nlast century, and which is twenty miles from Glasgow--she would have\r\nbeen handicapped exactly as St. Petersburg has been till now in the\r\ncommercial race.\r\n\r\n\"For some years the subject was discussed at St. Petersburg, and\r\nmore than one scheme was proposed; at last the project of General N.\r\nPooteeloff was adopted. According to this plan, a canal has been cut\r\nthrough the shallow bottom of the Gulf of Finland, all the way from\r\nCronstadt to St. Petersburg. The line of this canal is from northwest to\r\nsoutheast; it may be said to run very nearly parallel to the coast line\r\non the south side of the Gulf, and about three miles distant from it.\r\nThis line brings the canal to the southwest end of St. Petersburg, where\r\nthere are a number of islands, which have formed themselves, in the\r\ncourse of ages, where the Bolshaya, or Great Neva, flows into the Gulf.\r\nIt is on these islands that the new port is to be formed. It is a very\r\nlarge harbor, and capable of almost any amount of extension. It will be\r\nin connection with the whole railway system of Russia. One part of the\r\nscheme is that of a new canal, on the south side of the city, to connect\r\nthe maritime canal, as well as the new harbor, with the Neva, so that\r\nthe large barges may pass, by a short route, to the river on the east,\r\nand thus avoid the bridges and traffic of the city.\r\n\r\n\"The whole length of the canal is about eighteen miles. The longer\r\nportion of it is an open channel, which is made 350 feet wide at bottom.\r\nIts course will be marked by large iron floating buoys; these it is\r\nproposed to light with gas by a new self-acting process which has been\r\nvery successful in other parts of the world; by this means the canal\r\nwill be navigable by night as well as by day. The original plan was to\r\nhave made the canal 20 feet deep, but this has been increased to 22\r\nfeet. The Gulf of Finland gradually deepens toward Cronstadt, so that\r\nthe dredging was less at the western end. This part was all done by\r\ndredgers, and the earth brought up was removed to a safe distance by\r\nmeans of steam hopper barges. The contract for this part of the work\r\nwas sublet to an American firm--Morris and Cummings, of New York. The\r\neastern portion of the work on the canal is by far the most important,\r\nand about six miles of it is protected by large and strong embankments\r\non each side. These embankments were formed by the output of the\r\ndredgers, and are all faced with granite bowlders brought from Finland;\r\nat their outer termination the work is of a more durable kind, the\r\nfacing is made of squared blocks of granite, so that it may stand the\r\nheavy surf which at times is raised by a west wind in the Gulf. These\r\nembankments, as already stated, extend over a space of nearly six miles,\r\nand represent a mass of work to which there is no counterpart in the\r\nSuez Canal; nor does the plan of the new Manchester Canal present\r\nanything equivalent to it. The width of this canal also far exceeds any\r\nof those notable undertakings. The open channel is, as stated above, 350\r\nft. wide; within the embankments the full depth of 22 ft. extends to 280\r\nft., and the surface between the embankments is 700 ft. This is nearly\r\ntwice the size of the Suez Canal at the surface, which is 100 meters,\r\nor about 320 ft., while it is only about 75 ft. at the bottom; the\r\nAmsterdam Canal is 78 ft. wide. The new Manchester Canal is to be 100\r\nft. of full depth, and it boasts of this superiority over the great work\r\nof Lesseps. The figures given above will show how far short it comes of\r\nthe dimensions of the St. Petersburg Canal. The Manchester Canal is to\r\nbe 24 ft. in depth; in that it has the advantage of 2 ft. more than the\r\nSt. Petersburg Canal; but with the ample width this one possesses, this,\r\nor even a greater depth, can be given if it should be found necessary.\r\nMost probably this will have ultimately to be done, for ocean going\r\nsteamers are rapidly increasing in size since the St. Petersburg Canal\r\nwas planned, and in a very few years the larger class of steamers might\r\nhave to deliver their cargoes at Cronstadt, as before, if the waterway\r\nto St. Petersburg be not adapted to their growing dimensions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ST. PETERSBURG AND CRONSTADT MARITIME CANAL, OPENED\r\nBY THE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA, ON WEDNESDAY, MAY 27, 1885.]\r\n\r\n\"The dredging between the embankments of the canal was done by an\r\nimproved process, which may interest those connected with such works. It\r\nmay be remembered that the Suez Canal was mostly made by dredging, and\r\nthat the dredgers had attached to them what the French called 'long\r\ncouloirs' or spouts, into which water was pumped, and by this means the\r\nstuff brought up by the dredgers was carried to the sides of the canal,\r\nand there deposited. The great width of the St. Petersburg Canal was too\r\nmuch for the long couloirs, hence some other plan had to be found. The\r\nplan adopted was that invented by Mr. James Burt, and which had been\r\nused with the greatest success on the New Amsterdam Canal. Instead of\r\nthe couloir, floating pipes, made of wood, are in this system employed;\r\nthe earth or mud brought up has a copious stream of water poured on it,\r\nwhich mixes in the process of descending, and the whole becomes a thick\r\nliquid. This, by means of a centrifugal pump, is propelled through the\r\nfloating pipes to any point required, where it can be deposited. The\r\ncouloir can only run the output a comparatively short distance, while\r\nthis system can send it a quarter of a mile, or even further, if\r\nnecessary. Its power is not limited to the level surface of the water.\r\nI saw on my visit to the canal one of the dredgers at work, and the\r\nfloating pipes lay on the water like a veritable sea-serpent, extending\r\nto a long distance where the stuff had to be carried. At that point the\r\npipe emerged from the water, and what looked very much like a vertebra\r\nor two of the serpent crossed the embankment, went down the other side,\r\nand there the muddy deposit was pouring out in a steady flow. Mr. Burt\r\npointed out to me one part of the works where his pump had sent the\r\nstuff nearly half a mile away, and over undulating ground. This system\r\nwill not suit all soils. Hard clay, for instance, will not mix with the\r\nwater; but where the matter brought up is soft and easily diluted, this\r\nplan possesses many advantages, and its success here affords ample\r\nevidence of its merits.\r\n\r\n\"About five miles below St. Petersburg, a basin had been already\r\nfinished, with landing quays, sheds, and offices; and there is an\r\nembankment connecting it with the railways of St. Petersburg, all ready\r\nfor ships to arrive. When the ships of all nations sail up to the\r\ncapital, then the ideas of Peter the Great, when he laid the foundations\r\nof St. Petersburg, will be realized. St. Petersburg will be no longer an\r\ninland port. It will, with its ample harbor and numerous canals among\r\nits streets, become the Venice of the North. Its era of commercial\r\ngreatness is now about to commence. The ceremony of letting the waters\r\nof the canal into the new docks was performed by the Emperor in October,\r\n1883. The Empress and heir apparent, with a large number of the Court,\r\nwere present on the occasion. The works on the canal, costing about a\r\nmillion and a half sterling, were begun in 1876, and have been carried\r\nout under the direction of a committee appointed by the Government,\r\npresided over by his Excellency, N. Sarloff. The resident engineer is M.\r\nPhofiesky; and the contractors are Messrs. Maximovitch and Boreysha.\"\r\n\r\nWe heartily congratulate the Russian government and the Russian nation\r\nupon the accomplishment of this great and useful work of peace. It will\r\ncertainly benefit English trade. The value of British imports from the\r\nnorthern ports of Russia for the year 1883 was £13,799,033; British\r\nexports, £6,459,993; while from the southern ports of Russia our trade\r\nwas: British imports, £7,177,149; British exports, £1,169,890--making a\r\ntotal British commerce with European Russia of £20,976,182 imports from\r\nRussia and £7,629,883 exports to Russia. It cannot be to the interest of\r\nnations which are such large customers of each other to go to war\r\nabout a few miles of Afguhan frontier. The London _Chamber of Commerce\r\nJournal_, ably edited by Mr. Kenric B. Murray, Secretary to the Chamber,\r\nhas in its May number an article upon this subject well deserving of\r\nperusal. It points out that in case of war most of the British export\r\ntrade to Russia would go through Germany, and might possibly never again\r\nreturn under British control. In spite of Russian protective duties,\r\nthis trade has been well maintained, even while the British import\r\nof Russian commodities, wheat, flax, hemp, tallow, and timber, was\r\ndeclining 40 per cent. from 1883 to 1884. The St. Petersburg Maritime\r\nCanal will evidently give much improved facilities to the direct export\r\nof English goods to Russia. Without reference to our own manufactures,\r\nit should be observed that the Russian cotton mills, including those of\r\nPoland, consume yearly 264 million pounds of cotton, most of which comes\r\nthrough England. The importation of English coal to Russia has afforded\r\na noteworthy instance of the disadvantage hitherto occasioned by the\r\nwant of direct navigation to St. Petersburg; the freight of a ton of\r\ncoal from Newcastle to Cronstadt was six shillings and sixpence, but\r\nfrom Cronstadt to St. Petersburg it cost two shillings more. It is often\r\nsaid, in a tone of alarm and reproach, that Russia is very eager to get\r\nto the sea. The more Russia gets to the sea everywhere, the better it\r\nwill be for British trade with Russia; and friendly intercourse with\r\nan empire containing nearly a hundred millions of people is not to be\r\nlightly rejected.--_Illustrated London News_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW FRENCH DISPATCH BOAT MILAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Milan, a new dispatch boat, has recently been making trial trips at\r\nBrest. It was constructed at Saint Nazaire, by the \"Societe des Ateliers\r\net Chantiers de la Loire,\" and is the fastest man-of-war afloat. It\r\nhas registered 17 knots with ordinary pressure, and with increase\r\nof pressure can make 18 knots, but to attain such high speed a very\r\npowerful engine is necessary. In fact, a vessel 303 ft. long, 33 ft.\r\nwide, and drawing 12 ft. of water, requires an engine which can develop\r\n4,000 H.P.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW FRENCH DISPATCH BOAT MILAN.]\r\n\r\nThe hull of the Milan is of steel, and is distinguished for its extreme\r\nlightness. The vessel has two screws, actuated by four engines arranged\r\ntwo by two on each shaft.\r\n\r\nThe armament consists of five three inch cannons, eight revolvers, and\r\nfour tubes for throwing torpedoes.\r\n\r\nThe Milan can carry 300 tons of coal, an insufficient quantity for\r\na long cruise, but this vessel, which is a dispatch boat in every\r\nacceptation of the word, was constructed for a definite purpose. It\r\nis the first of a series of very rapid cruisers to be constructed in\r\nFrance, and yet many English packets can attain a speed at least equal\r\nto that of the Milan. We need war vessels which can attain twenty knots,\r\nto be master of the sea.--_L'Illustration_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAUNCHING AND DOCKING OF SHIPS SIDEWISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe slips of the shipyards at Alt-Hofen (Hungary) belonging to the\r\nImperial and Royal Navigation Company of the Danube are so arranged that\r\nthe vessels belonging to its fleet can be hauled up high and dry or\r\nbe launched sidewise. They comprise three distinct groups, which are\r\nadapted, according to needs, for the construction or repair of steamers,\r\ntwenty of which can be put into the yard at a time. The operation, which\r\nis facilitated by the current of the Danube, consists in receiving the\r\nships upon frames beneath the water and at the extremity of inclined\r\nplanes running at right angles with them. After the ship has been made\r\nsecure by means of wedges, the frame is drawn up by chains that\r\nwind round fixed windlasses. These apparatus are established upon a\r\nhorizontal surface 25.5 feet above low-water mark so as to give the\r\nnecessary slope, and at which terminate the tracks. They may, moreover,\r\nbe removed after the ships have been taken off, and be put down again\r\nfor launching. For 136 feet of their length the lower part of the\r\nsliding ways is permanent, and fixed first upon rubble masonry and then\r\nupon the earth.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 gives a general view of the arrangement. The eight sliding ways\r\nof the central part are usually reserved for the largest vessels. The\r\ntwo extreme ones comprise, one of them 7, and the other 6, tracks only,\r\nand are maneuvered by means of the same windlasses as the others. A\r\ntrack, FF, is laid parallel with the river, in order to facilitate,\r\nthrough lorries, the loading and unloading of the traction chains. These\r\nlatter are ¾ inch in diameter, while those that pass around the hulls\r\nare 1 inch.\r\n\r\nThe motive power is furnished by a 10 H.P. steam engine, which serves at\r\nthe same time for actuating the machine tools employed in construction\r\nor repairs. The shaft is situated at the head of the ways, and sets in\r\nmotion four double-gear windlasses of the type shown in Fig. 2. The\r\nratio of the wheels is as 9 to 1. The speed at which the ships move\r\nforward is from 10 to 13 feet per minute. Traction is effected\r\ncontinuously and without shock. After the cables have been passed around\r\nthe hull, and fastened, they are attached to four pairs of blocks each\r\ncomprising three pulleys. The lower one of these is carried by rollers\r\nthat run over a special track laid for this purpose on the inclined\r\nplane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--WAYS OF LAUNCHING VESSELS SIDEWISE.]\r\n\r\nThe three successive positions that a boat takes are shown in Fig. 1.\r\nIn the first it has just passed on to the frame, and is waiting to be\r\nhauled up on the ways; in the second it is being hauled up; and in the\r\nthird the frame has been removed and the boat is shoved up on framework,\r\nso that it can be examined and receive whatever repairs may be\r\nnecessary. This arrangement, which is from plans by Mr. Murray Jackson,\r\nsuffices to launch 16 or 18 new boats annually, and for the repair\r\nof sixty steamers and lighters. These latter are usually 180 feet in\r\nlength, 24 feet in width, and 8 feet in depth, and their displacement,\r\nwhen empty, is 120 tons. The dimensions of the largest steamers vary\r\nbetween 205 and 244 feet in length, and 25 and 26 feet in width. They\r\nare 10 feet in depth, and, when empty, displace from 440 to 460 tons.\r\nThe Austrian government has two monitors repaired from time to time in\r\nthe yards of the company. The short and wide forms of these impose a\r\nheavier load per running foot upon the ways than ordinary boats do, but\r\nnevertheless no difficulty has ever been experienced, either in hauling\r\nthem out or putting them back into the water.--_Le Genie Civil_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--DETAILS OF WINDLASS.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED HIGH-SPEED ENGINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis engine, exhibited at South Kensington by Fielding and Platt, of\r\nGloucester, consists virtually of a universal joint connecting two\r\nshafts whose axes form an obtuse angle of about 157 degrees. It has four\r\ncylinders, two being mounted on a chair coupling on each shaft. The word\r\ncylinder is used in a conventional sense only, since the cavities acting\r\nas such are circular, whose axes, instead of being straight lines, are\r\narcs of circles struck from the center at which the axes of the shafts\r\nwould, if continued, intersect. The four pistons are carried upon\r\nthe gimbal ring, which connects, by means of pivots, the two chair\r\ncouplings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIELDING HIGH SPEED ENGINE.]\r\n\r\nFig. 10 shows clearly the parts constituting the coupling, cylinders,\r\nand pistons of a compound engine. CC are the high-pressure cylinders; DD\r\nthe low pressure; EEEE the four parts forming the gimbal ring, to which\r\nare fixed in pairs the high and low pressure pistons, GG and FF; HHHH\r\nare the chair arms formed with the cylinders carrying pivots, IIII,\r\nwhich latter fit into the bearings, JJJJ, in the gimbal ring. Figs.\r\n1, 2, 3, 4 show these parts connected and at different points of the\r\nshaft's rotation. The direction of rotation is shown by the arrow. In\r\nFig. 1 the lower high-pressure cylinder, C, is just about taking steam,\r\nthe upper one just closing the exhaust; the low-pressure pistons are at\r\nhalf stroke, that in sight exhausting, the opposite one, which cannot be\r\nseen in this view, taking steam.\r\n\r\nIn Fig 2 the shaft has turned through one-eighth of a revolution; in\r\nFig. 3, a quarter turn; Fig. 4, three-eighths of a turn. Another eighth\r\nturn brings two parts into position represented by Fig. 1, except the\r\nsecond pair of cylinders now replace the first pair. The bearings, KL,\r\nsupport the two shafts and act as stationary valves, against which faces\r\nformed on the cylinders revolve; steam and exhaust ports are provided in\r\nthe faces of K and L, and two ports in the revolving faces, one to each\r\ncylinder. The point at which steam is cut off is determined by the\r\nlength of the admission ports in K and L. The exhaust port is made of\r\nsuch a length that steam may escape from the cylinders during the whole\r\nof the return stroke of pistons.\r\n\r\nFig. 5 shows the complete engine. It will be seen that the engine is\r\nentirely incased in a box frame, with, however, a lid for ready access\r\nto the parts for examination, one great advantage being that the engine\r\ncan be worked with the cover removed, thus enabling any leakage past the\r\npistons or valve faces to be at once detected. The casing also serves to\r\nretain a certain amount of lubricant.\r\n\r\nThe lubrication is effected by means of a triple sight-feed lubricator,\r\none feeder delivering to steam inlet, and two serving the main shaft\r\nbearings.\r\n\r\nFigs, 6 and 7 are an end elevation and plan of the same engine. There is\r\nnothing in the other details calling for special notice.\r\n\r\nFigs. 8 and 9 show the method of machining the cylinders and pistons,\r\nthe whole of which can be done by ordinary lathes, which is evidently a\r\ngreat advantage in the event of reboring, etc., being required in the\r\ncolonies or other countries where special tools are inaccessible.\r\n\r\nFigs. 11 and 12 are sections which explain themselves.--_The Engineer_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL TRANSIT CO'S PIPE LINES FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF PETROLEUM\r\nTO THE SEABOARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Englishmen and Americans have been alike interested in the late\r\nproject for forcing water by a pipe line over the mountainous region\r\nlying between Suakim and Berber in the far-off Soudan, few men of either\r\nnation have any proper conception of the vast expenditure of capital,\r\nnatural and engineering difficulties overcome, and the bold and\r\nsuccessful enterprise which has brought into existence far greater pipe\r\nlines in our own Atlantic States. We refer to the lines of the National\r\nTransit Company, which have for a purpose the economic transportation of\r\ncrude petroleum from Western Pennsylvania to the sea coast at New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, and Baltimore, and to the Lakes at Cleveland and Buffalo.\r\n\r\nTo properly commence our sketch of this truly gigantic enterprise, we\r\nmust go back to the discovery of petroleum in the existing oil regions\r\nof Pennsylvania and adjacent States. Its presence as an oily scum on the\r\nsurface of ponds and streams had long been known, and among the Indians\r\nthis \"rock-oil\" was highly appreciated as a vehicle for mixing their wax\r\npaint, and for anointing their bodies; in later years it was gathered in\r\na rude way by soaking it up in blankets, and sold at a high price for\r\nmedicinal purposes only, under the name of Seneca rock oil, Genesee oil,\r\nIndian oil, etc.\r\n\r\nBut the date of its discovery as an important factor in the useful arts\r\nand as a source of enormous national wealth was about 1854. In the year\r\nnamed a certain Mr. George H. Bissell of New Orleans accidentally met\r\nwith a sample of the \"Seneca Oil,\" and being convinced that it had a\r\nvalue far beyond that usually accorded it, associated himself with\r\nsome friends and leased for 99 years some of the best oil springs near\r\nTitusville, Pa. This lease cost the company $5,000, although only a few\r\nyears before a cow had been considered a full equivalent in value for\r\nthe same land. The original prospectors began operations by digging\r\ncollecting ditches, and then pumping off the oil which gathered upon the\r\nsurface of the water. But not long after this first crude attempt at oil\r\ngathering, the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Co. was organized, with Prof. B.\r\nSilliman of Yale College as its president, and a more intelligent method\r\nwas introduced into the development of the oil-producing formation. In\r\n1858, Col. Drake of New Haven was employed by the Pennsylvania Co. to\r\nsink an artesian well; and, after considerable preparatory work, on\r\nAugust 28, 1859, the first oil vein was tapped at a depth of 69½ feet\r\nbelow the surface; the flow was at first 10 barrels per day, but in the\r\nfollowing September this increased to 40 barrels daily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING THE NATIONAL TRANSIT CO.'S PIPE LINES.]\r\n\r\nThe popular excitement and the fortunes made and lost in the years\r\nfollowing the sinking of the initial well are a matter of history,\r\nwith which we have here nothing to do. It is sufficient to say that a\r\nmultitude of adventurers were drawn by the \"oil-craze\" into this late\r\nwilderness, and the sinking of wells extended with unprecedented\r\nrapidity over the region near Titusville and from there into more\r\ndistant fields.\r\n\r\nBy June 1, 1862, 495 wells had been put down near Titusville, and the\r\ndaily output of oil was nearly 6,000 barrels, selling at the wells\r\nat from $4.00 to $6.00 per barrel. But the tapping of this vast\r\nsubterranean storehouse of oleaginous wealth continued, until the\r\nestimated annual production was swelled from 82,000 barrels in 1859 to\r\n24,385,966 barrels in 1883; in the latter year 2,949 wells were put\r\ndown, many of them, however, being simply dry holes.[1] The total output\r\nof oil in the Pennsylvania regions, between 1859 and 1883, is estimated\r\nat about 234,800,000 barrels--enough oil to fill a tank about 10,000\r\nfeet square, nearly two miles to a side, to a depth of over 13½ feet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The total number of wells in the Pennsylvania oil regions\r\ncannot be given. In the years 1876-1884, inclusive, 28,619 wells were\r\nsunk; this is an average of 3,179 per year. During the same period 2,507\r\ndry holes were drilled at an average cost of $1,500 each.]\r\n\r\nAs long as oil could be sold at the wells at from $4.00 to $10.00\r\na barrel, the cost of transportation was an item hardly worthy of\r\nconsideration, and railroad companies multiplied and waged a bitter\r\nwar with each other in their scramble after the traffic. But as the\r\nproduction increased with rapid strides, the market price of oil fell\r\nwith a corresponding rapidity, until the quotations for 1884 show\r\nfigures as low as 50 to 60 cents per barrel for the crude product at Oil\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1865, the freight charge per barrel for a carload of oil\r\nfrom Titusville to New York, and the return of the empty barrels,\r\nwas $3.50.[1] To this figure was added the cost of transportation by\r\npipe-line from Pithole to Titusville, $1.00; cost of barreling, 25\r\ncents; freight to Corry, Pa., 80 cents; making the total cost of a\r\nbarrel of crude oil in New York, $5.55. In January, 1866, the barrel\r\nof oil in New York cost $10.40, including in this figure, however, the\r\nGovernment tax of $1.00 and the price of the barrel, $3.25.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is stated that in 1862 the cost of sending one barrel of\r\noil to New York was $7.45. Steamboats charged $2.00 per barrel from Oil\r\nCity to Pittsburg, and the hauling from Oil Creek to Meadville cost\r\n$2.25 per barrel.]\r\n\r\nThe question of reducing these enormous transportation charges was first\r\nbroached, apparently, in 1864, when a writer in the _North American_,\r\nof Philadelphia, outlined a scheme for laying a pipe-line down the\r\nAllegheny River to Pittsburg. This project was violently assailed by\r\nboth the transportation companies and the people of the oil region,\r\nwho feared that its success would interfere with their then great\r\nprosperity. But short pipe-lines, connecting the wells with storage\r\ntanks and shipping points, grew apace and prepared the way for the vast\r\nnetwork of the present day, which covers this region and throws out arms\r\nto the ocean and the lakes.\r\n\r\nAmong the very first, if not the first, pipe lines laid was one put down\r\nbetween the Sherman well and the railway terminus on the Miller farm.\r\nIt was about 3 miles long, and designed by a Mr. Hutchinson; he had an\r\nexaggerated idea of the pressure to be exercised, and at intervals of 50\r\nto 100 feet he set up air chambers 10 inches in diameter. The weak point\r\nin this line, however, proved to be the joints; the pipes were of cast\r\niron, and the joint-leakage was so great that little, if any, oil ever\r\nreached the end of the line, and the scheme was abandoned in despair.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this question of oil transportation, a sketch of the\r\nvarious methods, other than pipelines, adopted in Pennsylvania may not\r\nbe out of place. We are mainly indebted to Mr. S.F. Peckham, in his\r\narticle on \"Petroleum and its Products\" in the U. S. Census Report of\r\n1880, for the information relating to tank-cars immediately following:\r\n\r\nOriginally the oil was carried in 40 and 42 gallon barrels, made of oak\r\nand hooped with iron; early in 1866, or possibly in 1865, tank-cars\r\nwere introduced. These were at first ordinary flat-cars upon which were\r\nplaced two wooden tanks, shaped like tubs, each holding about 2,000\r\ngallons.\r\n\r\nOn the rivers, bulk barges were also, after a time, introduced on the\r\nOhio and Allegheny; at first these were rude affairs, and often of\r\ninadequate strength; but as now built they are 130 x 22 x 16 feet, in\r\ntheir general dimensions, and divided into eight compartments, with\r\nwater-tight bulkheads; they hold about 2,200 barrels.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 iron-tank cars superseded those of wood, with tanks of varying\r\nsizes, ranging from 3,856 to 5,000 gallons each. These tanks were\r\ncylinders, 24 feet 6 inches long, and 66 inches in diameter, and weighed\r\nabout 4,500 lb. The heads are made of 5/46 in. flange iron, the bottom\r\nof ½ in., and the upper half of the shell of 3/16 in. tank iron.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1865, the Oil Transportation Co. completed and tested a\r\npipe-line 32,000 feet long; three pumps were used upon it, two at\r\nPithole and one at Little Pithole. July 1, 1876, the pipe-line owners\r\nheld a meeting at Parkers to organize a pipe-line company to extend to\r\nthe seaboard under the charter of the Pennsylvania Transportation Co.,\r\nbut the scheme was never carried out. In January, 1878, the Producers'\r\nUnion organized for a similar seaboard line, and laid pipes, but they\r\nnever reached the sea, stopping their line at Tamanend, Pa. The lines\r\nof the National Transit Co., illustrated in our map, were completed in\r\n1880-81, and this company, to which the United Pipe Lines have also\r\nbeen transferred, is said to have $15,000,000 invested in plant for the\r\ntransport of oil to tide water.\r\n\r\nThe National Transit Co. was organized under what was called the\r\nPennsylvania Co. act, about four years ago, and succeeded to the\r\nproperties of the American Transit Co., a corporation operating under\r\nthe laws of Pennsylvania. Since its organization the first named company\r\nhas constructed and now owns the following systems:\r\n\r\nThe line from Olean, N.Y., to Bayonne, N.J., and to Brooklyn, N.Y., of\r\nwhich a full page profile is given, showing the various pumping stations\r\nand the undulations over its route of about 300 miles. The Pennsylvania\r\nline, 280 miles long, from Colegrove, Pa., to Philadelphia. The\r\nBaltimore line, 70 miles long, from Millway, Pa., to Baltimore. The\r\nCleveland line, 100 miles long, from Hilliards, Pa., to Cleveland, O.\r\nThe Buffalo line, 70 miles long, from Four Mile, Cattaraugus County,\r\nN.Y., to Buffalo, and the line from Carbon Center, Butler County, Pa.,\r\nto Pittsburg, 60 miles in length. This amounts to a total of 880 miles\r\nof main pipe-line alone, ranging from 4 inches to 6 inches in diameter;\r\nor, adding the duplicate pipes on the Olean New York line, we have a\r\nround total of 1,330 miles, not including loops and shorter branches and\r\nthe immense network of the pipes in the oil regions proper.\r\n\r\nA general description of the longest line will practically suffice for\r\nall, as they differ only in diameter of pipe used and power of the\r\npumping plant. As shown on the map and profile, this long line starts at\r\nOlean, near the southern boundary of New York State, and proceeds by the\r\nroute indicated to tide water at Bayonne, N.J., and by a branch under\r\nthe North and East rivers and across the upper end of New York city to\r\nthe Long Island refineries. This last named pipe is of unusual strength,\r\nand passes through Central Park; few of the thousands who daily frequent\r\nthe latter spot being aware of the yellow stream of crude petroleum that\r\nis constantly flowing beneath their feet. The following table gives the\r\nvarious pumping stations on this Olean New York line, and some data\r\nrelating to distances between stations and elevations overcome:\r\n\r\n  |----------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n  |                      |           |                |  Greatest  |\r\n  |                      |           |                |   Summit   |\r\n  |                      |   Miles   |   Elevation    |   between  |\r\n  |                      |  between  |  above Tide.   |  Stations. |\r\n  |  Pumping Stations.   | Stations. |     Ft.        |     Ft.    |\r\n  |______________________|___________|________________|____________|\r\n  | Olean                |    --     |     1,490      |     --     |\r\n  | Wellsville           |   28.20   |     1,510      |   2,490    |\r\n  | Cameron              |   27.91   |     1,042      |   2,530    |\r\n  | West Junction        |   29.70   |       911      |   1,917    |\r\n  | Catatonk             |   27.37   |       869      |   1,768    |\r\n  | Osborne              |   27.99   |     1,092      |   1,539    |\r\n  | Hancock              |   29.86   |       922      |   1,873    |\r\n  | Cochecton            |   26.22   |       748      |   1,854    |\r\n  | Swartwout            |   28.94   |       475      |   1,478    |\r\n  | Newfoundland         |   29.00   |       768      |   1,405    |\r\n  | Saddle River         |   28.77   |        35      |     398    |\r\n  |______________________|___________|________________|____________|\r\n\r\nOn this line two six-inch pipes are laid the entire length, and a third\r\nsix-inch pipe runs between Wellsville and Cameron, and about half way\r\nbetween each of the other stations, \"looped\" around them. The pipe used\r\nfor the transportation of oil is especially manufactured to withstand\r\nthe great strain to which it will be subjected, the most of it being\r\nmade by the Chester Pipe and Tube Works, of Chester, Pa., the Allison\r\nManufacturing Co., of Philadelphia and the Penna. Tube Works, of\r\nPittsburg, Pa. It is a lap-welded, wrought-iron pipe of superior\r\nmaterial, and made with exceeding care and thoroughly tested at the\r\nworks. The pipe is made in lengths of 18 feet, and these pieces are\r\nconnected by threaded ends and extra strong sleeves. The pipe-thread and\r\nsleeves used on the ordinary steam and water pipe are not strong enough\r\nfor the duty demanded of the oil-pipe. The socket for a 4-inch steam\r\nor water pipe is from 2½ to to 2¾ inches long, and is tapped with 8\r\nstandard threads to the inch, straight or parallel to the axis of the\r\npipe; with this straight tap only three or four threads come in contact\r\nwith the socket threads, or in any way assist in holding the pipes\r\ntogether. In the oil-pipe, the pipe ends and sockets are cut on a taper\r\nof ¾ inch to 1 foot, for a 4-inch pipe, and the socket used is thicker\r\nthan the steam and water socket, is 3¾ inches long, and has entrance for\r\n1 5/8 inches of thread on each pipe end tapped with 9 standard threads\r\nto the inch. In this taper socket you have iron to iron the whole length\r\nof the thread, and the joint is perfect and equal by test to the full\r\nstrength of the pipe. Up to 1877 the largest pipe used on the oil lines\r\nwas 4-inch, with the usual steam thread, but the joints leaked under the\r\npressure, 1,200 pounds to the square inch being the maximum the 8-thread\r\npipe would stand. This trouble has been remedied by the 9-thread,\r\ntaper-cut pipe of the present day, which is tested at the mill to 1,500\r\npounds pressure, while the average duty required is 1,200 pounds; as the\r\niron used in the manufacture of this line-pipe will average a tensile\r\ntest strain of 55,000 pounds per square inch, the safety factor is thus\r\nabout one-sixth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROFILE SHOWING NATIONAL TRANSIT CO.'S PIPE-LINE, FROM\r\nOLEAN TO SADDLE RIVER.]\r\n\r\nThe line-pipe is laid between the stations in the ordinary manner,\r\nexcepting that great care is exercised in perfecting the joints. No\r\nexpansion joints or other special appliances of like nature are used on\r\nthe line as far as we can learn; the variations in temperature being\r\ncompensated for, in exposed locations, by laying the pipe in long\r\nhorizontal curves. The usual depth below the surface is about 3 feet,\r\nthough in some portions of the route the pipe lies for miles exposed\r\ndirectly upon the surface. As the oil pumped is crude oil, and this as\r\nit comes from the wells carries with it a considerable proportion of\r\nbrine, freezing in the pipes is not to be apprehended. The oil,\r\nhowever, does thicken in very cold weather, and the temperature has a\r\nconsiderable influence on the delivery.\r\n\r\nA very ingenious patented device is used for cleaning out the pipes, and\r\nby it the delivery is said to have been increased in certain localities\r\n50 per cent. This is a stem about 2½ feet long, having at its front end\r\na diaphragm made of wings which can fold on each other, and thus enable\r\nit to pass an obstruction it cannot remove; this machine carries a set\r\nof steel scrapers, somewhat like those used in cleaning boilers. The\r\ndevice is put into the pipe, and propelled by the pressure transmitted\r\nfrom the pumps from one station to another; relays of men follow the\r\nscraper by the noise it makes as it goes through the pipe, one party\r\ntaking up the pursuit as the other is exhausted. They must never let it\r\nget out of their hearing, for if it stops unnoticed, its location can\r\nonly again be established by cutting the pipe.\r\n\r\nThe pumping stations are substantial structures of brick, roofed with\r\niron. The boiler house is removed some distance from the engine house\r\nfor greater safety from fire; the building, about 40 by 50 feet,\r\ncontains from six to seven tubular boilers, each 5 by 14 feet, and\r\ncontaining 80 three-inch tubes. The pump house is a similar brick\r\nstructure about 40 by 60 feet, and contains the battery of pumping\r\nengines to be described later. At each station are two iron tanks, 90\r\nfeet in diameter and 30 feet high; into these tanks the oil is delivered\r\nfrom the preceding station, and from them the oil is pumped into the\r\ntanks at the next station beyond. The pipe-system at each station is\r\nsimple, and by means of the \"loop-lines\" before mentioned the oil can be\r\npumped directly around any station if occasion would require it.\r\n\r\nThe pumps used on all these lines are the Worthington compound,\r\ncondensing, pressure pumping engines. The general characteristics of\r\nthese pumps are, independent plungers with exterior packing, valve-boxes\r\nsubdivided into separate small chambers capable of resisting very heavy\r\nstrains, and leather-faced metallic valves with low lift and large\r\nsurfaces. These engines vary in power from 200 to 800 horse-power,\r\naccording to duty required. They are in continuous use, day and night,\r\nand are required to deliver about 15,000 barrels of crude oil per 24\r\nhours, under a pressure equivalent to an elevation of 3,500 feet.\r\n\r\nWe have lately examined the latest pumping engine plant, and the largest\r\nyet built for this service, by the firm of H.R. Worthington; it is to be\r\nused at the Osborne Hollow Pumping Station. As patents are yet pending\r\non certain new features in this engine, we must defer a full description\r\nof it for a later issue of our journal.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania line has a single 6-inch pipe 280 miles long, with six\r\npumping stations as shown in the map, and groups of shorter lines, with\r\na loop extending from the main line to Milton, Pa., a shipping point for\r\nloading on cars. At Millway, Pa., a 5-inch pipe leaves the Pennsylvania\r\nline and runs to Baltimore, a distance of 70 miles, and is operated\r\nfrom the first named station alone, there being no intermediate pumping\r\nstation.[1] The Cleveland pipe, 100 miles long, is 5 inches in diameter,\r\nand has upon it four pumping stations; it carries oil to the very\r\nextensive refineries of the company at the terminal on Lake Erie. The\r\nBuffalo line is 4 inches in diameter and 70 miles long; it has a pumping\r\nstation at Four-Mile and at Ashford (omitted on the map). The Pittsburg\r\nline is 4 inches in diameter and 60 miles long; it has pumping stations\r\nat Carbon Center and at Freeport.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Millway is about 400 feet above tide-water at Baltimore,\r\nbut the line passes over a very undulating country in its passage to the\r\nlast named point. We regret that we have no profile on this 70 mile line\r\noperated by a single pumping plant.--_Ed. Engineering News_.]\r\n\r\nA very necessary and remarkably complete adjunct to the numerous pipe\r\nlines of this company is an independent telegraph system extending to\r\nevery point on its widely diverging lines. The storage capacity of the\r\nNational Transit Co.'s system is placed at 1,500,000 barrels, and\r\nthis tankage is being constantly increased to meet the demands of the\r\nproducers.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: As showing the extent of the sea-coast transportation of\r\npetroleum, we should mention that the statistics for 1884 show a total\r\nof crude equivalent exported from the United States in that year,\r\nequaling 16,661,086 barrels, of 51 gallons each. This is a daily average\r\nof 42,780 barrels.]\r\n\r\nThe company is officially organized as follows: C.A. Griscom, President;\r\nBenjamin Brewster, Vice President; John Bushnell, Secretary; Daniel\r\nO'Day, General Manager; J.H. Snow, General Superintendent. Mr. Snow\r\nwas the practical constructor of the entire system, and the general\r\nperfection of the work is mainly due to his personal experience, energy,\r\nand careful supervision. His engineering assistants were Theodore M.\r\nTowe and C.J. Hepburn on the New York line and J.B. Barbour on the\r\nPennsylvania lines.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise has been so far a great engineering success, and the oil\r\ndelivery is stated on good authority to be within 2 per cent. of the\r\ntheoretical capacity of the pipes. From a commercial standpoint, the\r\nultimate future of the undertaking will be determined by the lasting\r\nqualities of wrought iron pipe buried in the ground and subjected to\r\nenormous strain; time alone can determine this question.\r\n\r\nIn preparing this article we are indebted for information to the firm of\r\nH.R.

They doubt\r\nthe continuity and regularity of its supply. 2. They do not deem the\r\ndifference between the price of natural gas and coal sufficient as yet\r\nto justify the expenditure involved in the furnace changes necessary to\r\nthe substitution of the one for the other. These two objections will\r\ndoubtless disappear with additional experience in the production and\r\nregulation of the gas supply, and with enlarged competition among the\r\ncompanies engaging in its transmission from the wells to the works.\r\nAt present the use of natural gas as a substitute for coal in the\r\nmanufacture of glass, iron, and steel is in its infancy.\r\n\r\nNatural gas is as ancient as the universe. It was known to man in\r\nprehistoric times, we must suppose, for the very earliest historical\r\nreference to the Magi of Asia records them as worshiping the eternal\r\nfires which then blazed, and still blaze, in the fissures of the\r\nmountain heights overlooking the Caspian Sea. Those records appertain\r\nto a period at least 600 years before the birth of Christ; but the Magi\r\nmust have lived and worshiped long anterior to that time.\r\n\r\nZoroaster, reputed founder of the Parsee sect, is placed contemporary\r\nwith the prophet Daniel, from 2,500 to 600 B.C.; and, although Daniel\r\nhas been doubted, and Zoroaster may never have seen the light, the\r\nfissures of the Caucasus have been flaming since the earliest authentic\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nThe Parsees (Persians) did not originally worship fire. They believed\r\nin two great powers--the Spirit of Light, or Good, and the Spirit of\r\nDarkness, or Evil. Subsequent to Zoroaster, when the Persian empire rose\r\nto its greatest power and importance, overspreading the west to the\r\nshores of the Caspian and beyond, the tribes of the Caucasus suffered\r\npolitical subjugation; but the creed of the Magi, founded upon the\r\neternal flame-altars of the mountains, proved sufficiently vigorous to\r\ntransform the Parseeism of the conquerors to the fire worship of the\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the seventh century of the Christian era, the\r\nGrecian Emperor Heraclius overturned the fire altars of the Magi at\r\nBaku, the chief city on the Caspian, but the fire worshipers were not\r\nexpelled from the Caucasus until the Mohammedans subjugated the Persian\r\nEmpire, when they were driven into the Rangoon, on the Irrawaddy, in\r\nIndia, one of the most noted petroleum producing districts of the world.\r\n\r\nPetroleum and natural gas are so intimately related that one would\r\nhardly dare to say whether the gas proceeds from petroleum or the\r\npetroleum is deposited from the gas. It is, however, safe to assume that\r\nthey are the products of one material, the lighter element separating\r\nfrom the heavier under certain degrees of temperature and pressure.\r\nThus petroleum may separate from the gas as asphaltum separates from\r\npetroleum. But some speculative minds consider natural gas to be a\r\nproduct of anthracite coal. The fact that the great supply-field of\r\nnatural gas in Western Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia, and\r\nEastern Ohio is a bituminous and not an anthracite region does not of\r\nitself confute that theory, as the argument for it is, that the gas may\r\nbe tapped at a remote distance from the source of supply; and, whereas\r\nanthracite is not a gas-coal, while bituminous is, we are told to\r\nsuppose that the gas which once may have been a component part of the\r\nanthracite was long ago expelled by Nature, and has since been held in\r\nvast reservoirs with slight waste, awaiting the use of man. That is one\r\ntheory; and upon that supposition it is suggested that anthracite\r\nmay exist below the bituminous beds of the region lying between the\r\nAlleghany Mountains and the Great Lakes. Another theory is, that natural\r\ngas is a product of the sea-weed deposited in the Devonian stratum. But,\r\nleaving modern theories on the origin of natural gas and petroleum, we\r\nmay suppose the natural gas jets now burning in the fissures of the\r\nCaucasus to have started up in flames about the time when, according\r\nto the Old Testament, Noah descended from Mount Ararat, or very soon\r\nthereafter. In the language of modern science it would be safe to say\r\nthat those flames sprang up when the Caucasus range was raised from\r\nbeneath the surface of the universal sea. The believer in biblical\r\nchronology may say that those fires have been burning for four thousand\r\nyears--the geologist may say for four millions.\r\n\r\nWe know that Alexander the Great penetrated to the Caspian; and in\r\nPlutarch we read: \"Hence [Arbela] he marched through the province\r\nBabylon [Media?], which immediately submitted to him, and in Ecbatana\r\n[?] was much surprised at the sight of the place where fire issues in a\r\ncontinuous stream, like a spring of water, out of a cleft in the earth,\r\nand the stream of naphtha, which not far from this spot flows out so\r\nabundantly as to form a large lake. This naphtha, in other respects\r\nresembling bitumen, is so subject to take fire that, before it touches\r\nthe flame, it will kindle at the very light that surrounds it, and often\r\ninflames the intermediate air also. The barbarians, to show the power\r\nand nature of it, sprinkled the street that led to the king's lodgings\r\nwith little drops of it, and, when it was almost night, stood at the\r\nfarther end with torches, which being applied to the moistened places,\r\nthe first taking fire, instantly, as quick as a man could think of it,\r\nit caught from one end to another in such manner that the whole street\r\nwas one continued flame. Among those who used to wait upon the king, and\r\nfind occasion to amuse him, when he anointed and washed himself, there\r\nwas one Athenophanus, an Athenian, who desired him to make an experiment\r\nof the naphtha upon Stephanus, who stood by in the bathing place, a\r\nyouth with a ridiculously ugly face, whose talent was singing well.\r\n'For,' said he, 'if it take hold of him, and is not put out, it must\r\nundeniably be allowed to be of the most invincible strength.' The youth,\r\nas it happened, readily consented to undergo the trial, and as soon as\r\nhe was anointed and rubbed with it, his whole body was broke out into\r\nsuch a flame, and was so seized by the fire, that Alexander was in the\r\ngreatest perplexity and alarm for him, and not without reason; for\r\nnothing could have prevented him from being consumed by it if, by good\r\nchance, there had not been people at hand with a great many vessels of\r\nwater for the service of the bath, with all which they had much ado to\r\nextinguish the fire; and his body was so burned all over that he was\r\nnot cured of it a good while after. And thus it was not without some\r\nplausibility that they endeavor to reconcile the fable to truth, who say\r\nthis was the drug in the tragedies with which Medea anointed the crown\r\nand veils which she gave to Creon's daughter.\"\r\n\r\nAn interesting reference to the fire-worshipers of the Caucasus is\r\ncontained in the \"History of Zobeide,\" a tale of the wonderful Arabian\r\nNights Entertainment. It runs thus:\r\n\r\n\"I bought a ship at Balsora, and freighted it; my sisters chose to go\r\nwith me, and we set sail with a fair wind. Some weeks after, we cast\r\nanchor in a harbor which presented itself, with intent to water the\r\nship. As I was tired with having been so long on board, I landed with\r\nthe first boat, and walked up into the country. I soon came in sight of\r\na great town. When I arrived there, I was much surprised to see vast\r\nnumbers of people in different postures, but all immovable. The\r\nmerchants were in their shops, the soldiery on guard; every one seemed\r\nengaged in his proper avocation, yet all were become as stone.... I\r\nheard the voice of a man reading Al Koran.... Being curious to know why\r\nhe was the only living creature in the town,... he proceeded to tell\r\nme that the city was the metropolis of a kingdom now governed by his\r\nfather; that the former king and all his subjects were Magi, worshipers\r\nof fire and of Nardoun. the ancient king of the giants who rebelled\r\nagainst God. 'Though I was born,' continued he, 'of idolatrous parents,\r\nit was my good fortune to have a woman governess who was a strict\r\nobserver of the Mohammedan religion. She taught me Arabic from Al Koran;\r\nby her I was instructed in the true religion, which I would never\r\nafterward renounce. About three years ago a thundering voice was heard\r\ndistinctly throughout the city, saying, \"Inhabitants, abandon the\r\nworship of Nardoun and of fire, and worship the only true God, who\r\nshoweth mercy!\" This voice was heard three years successively, but no\r\none regarded it. At the end of the last year all the inhabitants were in\r\nan instant turned to stone. I alone was preserved.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing tale we doubtless have reference to the destruction\r\nof Baku, on the Caspian (though to sail from Balsora to Baku is\r\nimpossible), and the driving away into India, by the Arabs under Caliph\r\nOmar, of all who refused to renounce fire-worship and adopt the creed\r\nof the Koran. The turning of the refractory inhabitants into stone is\r\nprobably the Arabian storyteller's figurative manner of referring to the\r\nfinding of dead bodies in a mummified condition.\r\n\r\nIt is known that the Egyptians made use of bitumen, in some form, in\r\nthe preservation of their dead, a fact with which the Arabians were\r\nfamiliar. As the Magi held the four elements of earth, air, fire, and\r\nwater to be sacred, they feared to either bury, burn, sink, or expose\r\nto air the corrupting bodies of their deceased. Therefore, it was their\r\npractice to envelop the corpse in a coating of wax or bitumen, so as\r\nto hermetically seal it from immediate contact with either of the four\r\nsacred elements. Hence the idea of all the bodies of the Magi left at\r\nBaku being turned to stone, while only the true believer in Mohammed\r\nremained in the flesh.\r\n\r\nMarco Polo, the famous traveler of the thirteenth century, makes\r\nreference to the burning jets of the Caucasus, and those fires are known\r\nto the Russians as continuing in existence since the army of Peter the\r\nGreat wrested the regions about the Caspian from the modern Persians.\r\nThe record of those flaming jets of natural gas is thus brought down in\r\nan unbroken chain of evidence from remote antiquity to the present day,\r\nand they are still burning.\r\n\r\nNumerous Greek and Latin writers testify to the known existence of\r\npetroleum about the shores of the Mediterranean two thousand years ago.\r\nMore modern citations may, however, be read with equal interest. In the\r\n\"Journal of Sir Philip Skippon's Travels in France,\" in 1663, we find\r\nthe following curious entries:\r\n\r\n\"We stayed in Grenoble till August 1st, and one day rode out, and, after\r\ntwice fording the river Drac (which makes a great wash) at a league's\r\ndistance, went over to Pont de Clef, a large arch across that river,\r\nwhere we paid one sol a man; a league further we passed through a large\r\nvillage called Vif, and about a league thence by S. Bathomew, another\r\nvillage, and Chasteau Bernard, where we saw a flame breaking out of the\r\nside of a bank, which is vulgarly called La Fountaine qui Brule; it\r\nis by a small rivulet, and sometimes breaks out in other places; just\r\nbefore our coming some other strangers had fried eggs here. The soil\r\nhereabouts is full of a black stone, like our coal, which, perhaps, is\r\nthe continual fuel of the fire.... Near Peroul, about a league from\r\nMontpelier, we saw a boiling fountain (as they call it), that is, the\r\nwater did heave up and bubble as if it boiled. This phenomenon in the\r\nwater was caused by a vapor ascending out of the earth through the\r\nwater, as was manifest, for if that one did but dig anywhere near the\r\nplace, and pour water upon the place new digged, one should observe in\r\nit the like bubbling, the vapor arising not only in that place where the\r\nfountain was, but all thereabout; the like vapor ascending out of the\r\nearth and causing such ebullition in water it passes through hath been\r\nobserved in Mr. Hawkley's ground, about a mile from the town of Wigan,\r\nin Lancashire, which vapor, by the application of a lighted candle,\r\npaper; or the like, catches fire and flames vigorously. Whether or not\r\nthis vapor at Peroul would in like manner catch fire and burn I cannot\r\nsay, it coming not in our minds to make the experiment.... At Gabian,\r\nabout a day's journey from Montpelier, in the way to Beziers, is a\r\nfountain of petroleum. It burns like oil, is of a pungent scent, and a\r\nblackish color. It distills out of several places of the rock all the\r\nyear long, but most in the summer time. They gather it up with ladles\r\nand put it in a barrel set on end, which hath a spigot just at the\r\nbottom. When they have put in a good quantity, they open the spigot to\r\nlet out the water, and when the oil begins to come presently stop it.\r\nThey pay for the farm of this fountain about fifty crowns per annum.\r\nWe were told by one Monsieur Beaushoste, a chymist in Montpelier, that\r\npetroleum was the very same with oil of jet, and not to be distinguished\r\nfrom it by color, taste, smell, consistency, virtues, or any other\r\naccident, as he had by experience found upon the coast of the\r\nMediterranean Sea, in several places, as at Berre, near Martague, in\r\nProvence; at Messina, in Sicily, etc.\"\r\n\r\nIn Harris' \"Voyages,\" published in 1764, an article on the empire of\r\nPersia thus refers to petroleum:\r\n\r\n\"In several parts of Persia we meet with naphtha, both white and black;\r\nit is used in painting and varnish, and sometimes in physic, and there\r\nis an oil extracted from it which is applied to several uses. The most\r\nfamous springs of naphtha are in the neighborhood of Baku, which furnish\r\nvast quantities, and there are also upward of thirty springs about\r\nShamasky, both in the province of Schirwan. The Persians use it as oil\r\nfor their lamps and in making fireworks, of which they are extremely\r\nfond, and in which they are great proficients.\"\r\n\r\nPetroleum has long been known to exist also in the northern part of\r\nItaly, the cities of Parma and Genoa having been for many years lighted\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Szechuen, China, natural gas is obtained from beds of\r\nrock-salt at a depth of fifteen to sixteen hundred feet. Being brought\r\nto the surface, it is conveyed in bamboo tubes and used for lighting as\r\nwell as for evaporating water in the manufacture of salt. It is asserted\r\nthat the Chinese used this natural gas for illuminating purposes\r\nlong before gas-lighting was known to the Europeans. Remembering the\r\nunprogressive character of Chinese arts and industries, there is ground\r\nfor the belief that they may have been using this natural gas as an\r\nilluminant these hundreds of years.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the existence of petroleum was known to the Pilgrim\r\nFathers, who doubtless obtained their first information of it from the\r\nIndians, from whom, in New York and western Pennsylvania, it was called\r\nSeneka oil. It was otherwise known as \"British\" oil and oil of naphtha,\r\nand was considered \"a sovereign remedy for an inward bruise.\"\r\n\r\nThe record of natural gas in this country is not so complete as that of\r\npetroleum, but we learn that an important gas spring was known in West\r\nBloomfleld, N.Y., seventy years ago. In 1864 a well was sunk to a depth\r\nof three hundred feet upon that vein, from which a sufficient supply\r\nof gas was obtained to illuminate and heat the city of Rochester\r\n(twenty-five miles distant), it was supposed. But the pipes which were\r\nlaid for that purpose, being of wood, were unfitted to withstand the\r\npressure, in consequence of which the scheme was abandoned; but gas from\r\nthat well is now in use as an illuminant and as fuel both in the town of\r\nWest Bloomfield and at Honeoye Falls. The village of Fredonia, N.Y., has\r\nbeen using natural gas in lighting the streets for thirty years or there\r\nabout. On Big Sewickley Creek, in Westmoreland County, Pa., natural gas\r\nwas used for evaporating water in the manufacture of salt thirty years\r\nago, and gas is still issuing at the same place. Natural gas has been in\r\nuse in several localities in eastern Ohio for twenty-five years, and the\r\nwells are flowing as vigorously as when first known. It has also been\r\nin use in West Virginia for a quarter of a century, as well as in\r\nthe petroleum region of western Pennsylvania, where it has long been\r\nutilized in generating steam for drilling oil wells.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 the _American Journal of Science_ contained a letter from Dr.\r\nS.P. Hildreth, who, in writing of the products of the Muskingum (Ohio)\r\nValley, said: \"They have sunk two wells, which are now more than four\r\nhundred feet in depth; one of them affords a very strong and pure\r\nsalt water, but not in great quantity; the other discharges such vast\r\nquantities of petroleum, or, as it is vulgarly called, 'Seneka oil,' and\r\nbesides is so subject to such tremendous explosions of gas, as to force\r\nout all the water and afford nothing but gas for several days, that they\r\nmake little or no salt.\"\r\n\r\nThe value of the foregoing references is to be found in the testimony\r\nthey offer as to the duration of the supply of natural gas. Whether we\r\nlook to the eternal flaming fissures of the Caucasus, or to New York,\r\nPennsylvania, and Ohio, there is much to encourage the belief that the\r\nflow of natural gas may be, like the production of petroleum, increased\r\nrather than diminished by the draughts made upon it. Petroleum, instead\r\nof diminishing in quantity by the millions of barrels drawn from western\r\nPennsylvania in the last quarter of a century, seems to increase,\r\ngreater wells being known in 1884 than in any previous year, and prices\r\nhaving fallen from two dollars per bottle for \"Seneka oil\" to sixty\r\ncents per barrel for the same article under the name of crude petroleum.\r\nHence we may assume that, as new pipe-lines are laid, the supply of\r\nnatural gas available for use in the great manufacturing district of\r\nPittsburg and vicinity will be increased, and the price of this fuel\r\ndiminished in a corresponding ratio.\r\n\r\nNatural gas is now supplied in Pittsburg at a small discount on\r\nthe actual cost of coal used last year in the large manufacturing\r\nestablishments, an additional saving being made in dispensing with\r\nfiremen and avoidance of hauling ashes from the boiler-room. It is\r\nsupplied, for domestic purposes, at twenty cents per thousand cubic\r\nfeet, which is not cheaper than coal in Pittsburg, but it is a thousand\r\nper cent cleaner, and in that respect it promises to prove a great\r\nblessing, not only to those who can afford to use it, but to the\r\ncommunity at large, in the hope held out that the smoke and soot\r\nnuisance may be abated in part, if not wholly subdued, and that gleams\r\nof sunshine there may become less phenomenal in the future than they are\r\nat the present time. Twenty cents per thousand feet is too high a price\r\nto bring gas into general use for domestic purposes in a city where\r\ncoal is cheap. Ten cents would be too much, and no doubt five cents per\r\nthousand would pay a profit. The fact is, the dealers in natural gas\r\nappear to be somewhat doubtful of the continuity of supply, and\r\nanxious to get back the cost of wells and pipes in one year, which, if\r\nsuccessful, would be an enormous return on the investment.\r\n\r\nThere are objections to the use of natural gas by mill operators--that\r\nit costs too much, and that the continuity of the supply is uncertain;\r\nby heads of families, that it is odorless, and, in case of leakage from\r\nthe pipes, may fill a room and be ready to explode without giving the\r\nfragrant warning offered by common gas. Both of these objections will\r\nprobably disappear under the experience that time must furnish. More\r\nwells and tributary lines will lessen the cost and tend to regulate the\r\npressure for manufacturers. Cut-offs and escape pipes outside of the\r\nhouse will reduce the risk of explosions within. The danger in the\r\nhouse may also be lessened by providing healthful ventilation in all\r\napartments wherein gas shall be consumed.\r\n\r\nThis subject of, the ventilation of rooms in which common gas is\r\nordinarily used is beginning to attract attention. It is stated, upon\r\nscientific authority, that a jet of common gas, equivalent to twelve\r\nsperm candles, consumes 5.45 cubic feet of oxygen per hour, producing\r\n3.21 feet of carbonic acid gas, vitiating, according to Dr. Tidy's\r\n\"Handbook of Chemistry,\" 348.25 cubic feet of air. In every five cubic\r\nfeet of pure air in a room there is one cubic foot of oxygen and four\r\nof nitrogen. Without oxygen human life, as well as light, would become\r\nextinct. It is asserted that one common gas-jet consumes as much oxygen\r\nas five persons.\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid gas is the element which, in deep mines and vaults, causes\r\nalmost instant insensibility and suffocation to persons subjected to its\r\ninfluences, and instantly extinguishes the flame of any light lowered\r\ninto it. The normal quantity of this gas contained in the air we breathe\r\nis 0.04; one per cent, of it causes distress in breathing; two per cent,\r\nis dangerous; four per cent, extinguishes life, and four per cent of it\r\nis contained in air expelled from the lungs. According to Dr. Tidy's\r\ntable, each ordinary jet of common gas contributes to the air of a room\r\nsixteen by ten feet on the sides and nine feet high, containing 1,440\r\ncubic feet of air, twenty-two per cent, of carbonic acid gas, which,\r\ncontinued for twenty-four hours without ventilation, would reach the\r\nfatal four per cent.\r\n\r\nProf. Huxley gives, as a result of chemical analyses, the following\r\ntable of ratio of carbonic-acid gas in the atmosphere at the points\r\nnamed:\r\n\r\n  On the Thames, at London                           0.0343\r\n  In the streets of London                           0.0380\r\n  Top of Ben Nevis                                   0.0327\r\n  Dress circle of Haymarket theater (11:30 P.M.)     0.0757\r\n  Chancery Court (seven feet from the ground)        0.1930\r\n  From working mines (average of 339 samples)        0.7853\r\n  Largest amount in a Cornish mine                   2.0500\r\n\r\nIn addition to the consumption of oxygen and production of carbonic acid\r\nby the use of common gas, the gas itself, owing to defectiveness of the\r\nburner, is projected into the air. Now, considering the deleterious\r\nnature of all illuminating gases, the reasons for perfect ventilation of\r\nrooms in which natural gas is used for heating and culinary purposes are\r\nself-evident, not alone as a protection against explosions, but for the\r\nhealth of the occupants of the house, remembering that a larger supply\r\nof oxygen is said to be necessary for the perfect combustion of natural\r\nthan of common gas.\r\n\r\nCarbonic oxide, formed by the consumption of carbon, with an\r\ninsufficient supply of air, is the fatal poison of the charcoal furnace,\r\nnot infrequently resorted to, in close rooms, as a means of suicide.\r\nThe less sufficient the air toward perfect combustion, the smaller the\r\nquantity of carbonic acid and the greater the amount of carbonic oxide.\r\nThat is to say, at the time of ignition the chief product of combustion\r\nis carbonic oxide, and, unless sufficient air be added to convert the\r\noxide to carbonic acid, a decidedly dangerous product is given off into\r\nthe room. Yet, by means of a flue to carry off the poisonous gases from\r\nburning jets, the combustion of gas, creating a current, is made an aid\r\nto ventilation. Unfortunately, this important fact, if commonly known,\r\nis not much heeded by heads of families or builders of houses. But in\r\nany large community where gas comes into general use as an article of\r\nfuel, this fact will gradually become recognized and respected.\r\n\r\nThe property of indicating the presence of very minute quantities of gas\r\nin a room is claimed for an instrument recently described by C. Von Jahn\r\nin the _Revue Industrielle_. This is a porous cup, inverted and closed\r\nby a perforated rubber stopper. Through the perforation in the stopper\r\nthe interior of the cup is connected with a pressure gauge containing\r\ncolored water. It is claimed that the diffusion of gas through the\r\nearthenware raises the level of the water in the gauge so delicately\r\nthat the presence of one-half of one per cent, of gas may be detected by\r\nit. Other instruments of a slightly different character are credited by\r\ntheir inventors with most sensitive power of indicating gas-leakages,\r\nbut their practical efficiency remains to be demonstrated. An automatic\r\ncut-off for use outside of houses in which natural gas is consumed has\r\nbeen invented, but this writer knows nothing of either its mode of\r\naction or its effectiveness.\r\n\r\nThe great economic question, however, connected with the use of natural\r\ngas is, how will it affect the industrial interests of the country?\r\nThere are grounds for the belief that a sufficient supply of natural gas\r\nmay be found in the vicinity of Pittsburg to reduce the cost of fuel to\r\nsuch a degree as to make competition in the manufacture of iron, steel,\r\nand glass, in any part of the country where coal must be used, out of\r\nthe question. Such a condition of affairs would probably result in\r\ndriving the great manufacturing concerns of the country into the region\r\nwhere natural gas is to obtained. That may be anywhere from the western\r\nslope of the Alleghanies to Lake Erie or to Lake Michigan. And, if the\r\ncost of producing iron, steel, and glass can be so cheapened by the new\r\nfuel, the tariff question may undergo some important modification in\r\npolitics. For, if the reduction in the cost of fuel should ever become\r\nan offset to the lower rate of wages in Europe, the manufacturers of\r\nPennsylvania, who have long been the chief support of the protective\r\npolicy of the country, may lose their present interest in that question,\r\nand leave the tariff to shift for itself elsewhere. It should be\r\nremembered that natural gas is not, as yet, much cheaper than coal\r\nin Pittsburg. But it may safely be assumed that it will cheapen, as\r\npetroleum has done, by a development of the territory in which it is\r\nknown to exist in enormous quantities. It is quite possible that,\r\ninstead of buying gas, many factories will bore for it with success,\r\nor remove convenient to its natural sources, so that a gas well may\r\nultimately become an essential part of the \"plant\" of a mill or factory.\r\nEven now coal cannot compete with gas in the manufacture of window\r\nglass, for, the gas being free from sulphur and other impurities\r\ncontained in coal, produces a superior quality of glass; so that in this\r\nbranch of industry the question of superiority seems already settled.\r\n\r\nHaving said thus much of an industry now in its infancy but promising\r\ngreat growth, I submit tables of analyses of common and of the natural\r\nor marsh gas, the latter from a paper recently prepared by a committee\r\nof the Engineers' Society of Western Pennsylvania, and for the use of\r\nwhich I am indebted to that association:\r\n\r\nCOMMON GAS.\r\n\r\n  Hydrogen                                 46.0\r\n  Light carbureted hydrogen (marsh gas)    39.5\r\n  Condensible hydrocarbon                   3.8\r\n  Carbonic oxide                            7.5\r\n     \"     acid                             0.6\r\n  Aqueous vapor                             2.0\r\n  Oxygen                                    0.1\r\n  Nitrogen                                  0.5\r\n                                          -----\r\n                                          100.0\r\n\r\nNatural gas is now conveyed to Pittsburg through four lines of 5-5/8\r\ninch pipe and one line of eight inch pipe. A line of ten inch pipe is\r\nalso being laid. The pressure of the gas at the wells is from 150 to 230\r\npounds to the square inch. As the wells are on one side eighteen and on\r\nthe other about twenty-five miles distant, and as the consumption is\r\nvariable, the pressure at the city cannot be given. Greater pressure\r\nmight be obtained at the wells, but this would increase the liability\r\nto leakage and bursting of pipes. For the prevention of such casualties\r\nsafety valves are provided at the wells, permitting the escape of all\r\nsuperfluous gas. The enormous force of this gas may be appreciated from\r\na comparison of, say, 200 pounds pressure at the wells with a two ounce\r\npressure of common gas for ordinary lighting. The amount of natural gas\r\nnow furnished for use in Pittsburg is supposed to be something like\r\n25,000,000 cubic feet per day; the ten inch pipe now laying is estimated\r\nto increase the supply to 40,000,000 feet. The amount of manufactured\r\ngas used for lighting the same city probably falls below 3,000,000 feet.\r\n\r\nAbout fifty mills and factories of various kinds in Pittsburg now use\r\nnatural gas. It is used for domestic purposes in two hundred houses.\r\nIts superiority over coal in the manufacture of window glass is\r\nunquestioned. That it is not used in all the glass houses of Pittsburg\r\nis due to the fact that its advantages were not fully known when the\r\nfurnaces were fired last summer, and it costs a large sum to permit the\r\nfurnaces to cool off after being heated for melting. When the fires cool\r\ndown, and before they are started up again, the furnaces now using\r\ncoal will doubtless all be changed so as to admit natural gas. The\r\nsuperiority of French over American glass is said to be due to the fact\r\nthat the French use wood and the Americans coal in their furnaces, wood\r\nbeing free from sulphur, phosphorus, etc. The substitution of gas for\r\ncoal, while not increasing the cost, improves the quality of American\r\nglass, making it as nearly perfect as possible.\r\n\r\nWhile the gas is not used as yet in any smelting furnace nor in the\r\nBessemer converters, it is preferred in open hearth and crucible steel\r\nfurnaces, and is said to be vastly superior to coal for puddling. The\r\ncharge of a puddling furnace, consisting of 500 pounds of pig-metal and\r\neighty pounds of \"fix,\" produces with coal fuel 490 to 500 pounds of\r\niron. With gas for fuel, it is claimed that the same charge will yield\r\n520 to 530 pounds of iron. In an iron mill of thirty furnaces, running\r\neight heats each for twenty-four hours, this would make a difference in\r\nfavor of the gas of, say, 8 x 30 x 25 = 6,000 pounds of iron per day.\r\nThis is an important item of itself, leaving out the cost of firing with\r\ncoal and hauling ashes.\r\n\r\nFor generating steam in large establishments, one man will attend\r\na battery of twelve or twenty boilers, using gas as fuel, keep the\r\npressure uniform, and have the fire room clean as a parlor. For burning\r\nbrick and earthenware, gas offers the double advantage of freedom from\r\nsmoke and a uniform heat. The use of gas in public bakeries promises the\r\nabolition of the ash-box and its accumulation of miscellaneous filth,\r\nwhich is said to often impregnate the \"sponge\" with impurities.\r\n\r\nIn short, the advantages of natural gas as a fuel are so obvious to\r\nthose who have given it a trial, that the prediction is made that,\r\nshould the supply fail, many who are now using it will never return to\r\nthe consumption of crude coal in factories, but, if necessary, convert\r\nit or petroleum into gas at their own works.\r\n\r\nIt seems, indeed, that until we shall have acquired the wisdom enabling\r\nus to conserve and concentrate the heat of the sun, gas must be the fuel\r\nof the future.--_Popular Science Monthly_.\r\n\r\n          TABLE OF ANALYSIS OF NATURAL GAS--FROM

LEVOIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mineral asbestos is but a very poor packing material in\r\nsteam-boilers. Moreover, it acts as a strong grinding material on all\r\nmoving parts.\r\n\r\nFor some years I have tested the applicability of artificial\r\nprecipitates to close the holes in boilers, cylinder-covers, and\r\nstuffing boxes. I took, generally with the best success, alternate\r\nlayers of hemp-cotton, thread, and absorbent paper, all well saturated\r\nwith the chlorides of calcium and magnesium. The next layers of the same\r\nfiber are moistened with silicate of soda. By pressure the fluids are\r\nmixed and the pores are closed. A stuffing box filled with this mixture\r\nhas worked three years without grinding the piston-rod.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner I close the screw-thread hole in gas tubes used for\r\nconducting steam. I moisten the thread in the sockets with oleic acid\r\nfrom the candle-works, and dust over it a mixture of 1 part of minium,\r\n2 parts of quick-lime, and 1 part of linseed powder (without the oil).\r\nWhen the tube is screwed in the socket, the powder mixes with the oleic\r\nacid. The water coming in at first makes the linseed powder viscid.\r\nLater the steam forming the oleate of lime and the oleate of lead,\r\non its way to the outer air, presses it in the holes and closes them\r\nperfectly.\r\n\r\nAfter a year in use the tubes can be unscrewed with ease, and the screw\r\nthreads are perfectly smooth.\r\n\r\nWith this kind of packing only one exception must be made--that is, it\r\nis only tight under pressure; condensation or vacuum must be thoroughly\r\navoided.--_Chem.

These\r\nparticulars are derived from the letters patent granted in this country\r\nto the parties named.\r\n\r\nBalmain's invention was patented in England in 1877, and in this country\r\nin 1882. It is styled as Improvements in Painting, Varnishing, and\r\nWhitewashing, of which the following is a specification:\r\n\r\nThe said invention consists in a luminous paint, the body of which is a\r\nphosphorescent compound, or is composed in part of such a compound, and\r\nthe vehicle of which is such as is used as the vehicle in ordinary paint\r\ncompounds, viz., one which becomes dry by evaporation or oxidation.\r\n\r\nThe objector article to which such paint or varnish or wash is applied\r\nis itself rendered visible in the darkest place, and more or less\r\ncapable of imparting light to other objects, so as to render them\r\nvisible also. The phosphorescent substance found most suitable for the\r\npurpose is a compound obtained by simply heating together a mixture\r\nof lime and sulphur, or carbonate of lime and sulphur, or some of the\r\nvarious substances containing in themselves both lime and sulphur--such,\r\nfor example, as alabaster, gypsum, and the like--with carbon or other\r\nagent to remove a portion of the oxygen contained in them, or by heating\r\nlime or carbonate of lime in a gas or vapor containing sulphur.\r\n\r\nThe vehicle to be used for the luminous paint must be one which will dry\r\nby evaporation or oxidation, in order that the paint may not become soft\r\nor fluid by heat or be liable to be easily rubbed off by accident or use\r\nfrom the articles to which it has been applied. It may be any of the\r\nvehicles commonly used in oil-painting or any of those commonly used in\r\nwhat is known as \"distemper\" painting or whitewashing, according to the\r\nplace or purpose in or for which the paint is to be used.\r\n\r\nIt is found the best results are obtained by mixing the phosphorescent\r\nsubstance with a colorless varnish made with mastic or other resinous\r\nbody and turpentine or spirit, making the paint as thick as convenient\r\nto apply with a brush, and with as much turpentine or spirit as can\r\nbe added without impairing the required thickness. Good results may,\r\nhowever, be obtained with drying oils, spirit varnishes, gums, pastes,\r\nsizes, and gelatine solutions of every description, the choice being\r\nvaried to meet the object in view or the nature of the article in hand.\r\n\r\nThe mode of applying the paint, varnish, or wash will also depend upon\r\nthe circumstances of the case. For example, it may be applied by a\r\nbrush, as in ordinary painting, or by dipping or steeping the article\r\nin the paint, varnish, or wash; or a block or type may be used to\r\nadvantage, as in calico-printing and the like. For outdoor work, or\r\nwherever the surface illuminated is exposed to the vicissitudes of\r\nweather or to injury from mechanical contingencies, it is desirable to\r\ncover it with glass, or, if the article will admit of it, to glaze it\r\nover with a flux, as in enameling, or as in ordinary pottery, and this\r\nmay be accomplished without injury to the effect, even when the flux or\r\nglaze requires a red heat for fusion.\r\n\r\nAmong other applications of the said invention which may be enumerated,\r\nit is particularly advantageous for rendering visible clock or watch\r\nfaces and other indicators--such, for example, as compasses and the\r\nscales of barometers or thermometers--during the night or in dark places\r\nduring the night time. In applying the invention to these and other\r\nlike purposes there may be used either phosphorescent grounds with\r\ndark figures or dark grounds and phosphorescent figures or letters,\r\npreferring the former. In like manner there may be produced figures and\r\nletters for use on house-doors and ends of streets, wherever it is not\r\nconvenient or economical to have external source of light, signposts,\r\nand signals, and names or marks to show entries to avenues or gates, and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\nThe invention is also applicable to the illumination of railway\r\ncarriages by painting with phosphorescent paint a portion of the\r\ninterior, thus obviating the necessity for the expense and inconvenience\r\nof the use of lamps in passing through tunnels. It may also be applied\r\nexternally as warning-lights at the front and end of trains passing\r\nthrough tunnels, and in other similar cases, also to ordinary carriages,\r\neither internally or externally. As a night-light in a bed-room or in a\r\nroom habitually dark, the application has been found quite effectual, a\r\nvery small proportion of the surface rendered phosphorescent affording\r\nsufficient light for moving about the room, or for fixing upon and\r\nselecting an article in the midst of a number of complicated scientific\r\ninstruments or other objects.\r\n\r\nThe invention may also be applied to private and public buildings in\r\ncases where it would be economical and advantageous to maintain for a\r\nshort time a waning or twilight, so as to obviate the necessity for\r\nlighting earlier the gas or other artificial light. It may also be\r\nused in powder-mills and stores of powder, and in other cases where\r\ncombustion or heat would be a constant source of danger, and generally\r\nfor all purposes of artificial light where it is applicable.\r\n\r\nIn order to produce and maintain the phosphorescent light, full sunshine\r\nis not necessary, but, on the contrary, is undesirable. The illumination\r\nis best started by leaving the article or surface exposed for a short\r\ntime to ordinary daylight or even artificial light, which need not be\r\nstrong in order to make the illumination continue for many hours, even\r\ntwenty hours, without, the necessity of renewed exposure.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the invention consist in obtaining for the purposes of\r\ndaily life a light which is maintained at no cost whatever, is free from\r\nthe defects and contingent dangers arising from combustion or heat, and\r\ncan be applied in many cases where all other sources of light would be\r\ninconvenient or incapable of application.\r\n\r\nHeretofore phosphorus has been mixed with earthy oxides, carbonates,\r\nand sulphates, and with oxides and carbonates of metal, as tin, zinc,\r\nmagnesia, antimony, and chlorides of the same, also crystallized acids\r\nand salts and mineral substances, and same have been inclosed and\r\nexhibited in closely-stopped bottles as a phosphorus; but such union I\r\ndo not claim; but what I claim is:\r\n\r\nA luminous paint, the body of which is a phosphorescent substance, or\r\ncomposed in part of such substance, the vehicle of which is such as is\r\nordinarily used in paints, viz., one which will become dry by oxidation\r\nor evaporation, substantially as herein described.\r\n\r\nA. Krause, of Buffalo, N.Y., obtained a patent for improvement in\r\nphosphorescent substances dated December 30, 1879. The patentee says:\r\nThis invention relates to a substance which, by exposure to direct or\r\nindirect sun-light, or to artificial light, is so affected or brought\r\ninto such a peculiar condition that it will emit rays of light or become\r\nluminous in the dark.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that various bodies and compositions of matter,\r\nmore especially compositions containing sulphur in combination with\r\nearthy salts, possess the property of emitting rays of light in the\r\ndark after having been exposed to sun-light. All of these bodies and\r\ncompositions of matter are, however, not well adapted for practical\r\npurposes, because the light emitted by them is either too feeble to be\r\nof any practicable utility, or because the luminous condition is not\r\nof sufficient duration, or because the substances are decomposed by\r\nexposure to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAmong the materials which have been employed with the best results\r\nfor producing these luminous compositions are sea-shells, especially\r\noyster-shells. I have found by practical experiments that only the inner\r\nsurface of these shells is of considerable value in the production\r\nof luminous compositions, while the body of the shell, although\r\nsubstantially of the same chemical composition, does not, to any\r\nappreciable extent, aid in producing the desired result. It follows from\r\nthis observation that the smallest shells, which contain the largest\r\nsurface as compared with their cubic contents, will be best adapted for\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\nI have found that chalk, which is composed of the shells of microscopic\r\nanimals, possesses the desired property in the highest degree; and my\r\ninvention consists, therefore, of a luminous substance composed of such\r\nchalk, sulphur, and bismuth, as will be hereinafter fully set forth.\r\n\r\nIn preparing my improved composition I take cleaned or precipitated\r\nchalk, and subject it to the process of calcination in a suitable\r\ncrucible over a clear coal or charcoal fire for three or four hours,\r\nor thereabout. I then add to the calcined chalk about one-third of its\r\nweight of sulphur, and heat the mixture for from forty-five to ninety\r\nminutes, or thereabout. A small quantity of bismuth, in the proportion\r\nof about one per cent, or less of the mixture, is added together with\r\nthe sulphur.\r\n\r\nThe metal may be introduced in the metallic form in the shape of\r\nfillings, or in the form of a carbonate, sulphuret, sulphate, or\r\nsulphide, or oxide, as may be most convenient.\r\n\r\nThe substance produced in this manner possesses the property of emitting\r\nlight in the dark in a very high degree. An exposure to light of very\r\nshort duration, sometimes but for a moment, will cause the substance\r\nto become luminous and to remain in this luminous condition, under\r\nfavorable circumstances, for upward of twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the light emitted by this composition after exposure is\r\nconsiderable, and largely greater than the light produced by any of the\r\nsubstances heretofore known.\r\n\r\nThe hereinbefore described substance may be ground with oil and used\r\nlike ordinary paint; or it may be ground with any suitable varnish or be\r\nmixed in the manner of water colors; or it may be employed in any other\r\nsuitable and well-known manner in which paints are employed.\r\n\r\nMy improved luminous substance is adapted for a great variety of\r\nuses--for instance, for painting business and other signs, guide boards,\r\nclock and watch dials, for making the numbers on houses and railway\r\ncars, and for painting all surfaces which are exposed periodically to\r\ndirect or indirect light and desired to be easily seen during the night.\r\n\r\nWhen applied with oil or varnish, my improved luminous substance can\r\nbe exposed to the weather in the same manner as ordinary paint without\r\nsuffering any diminution of its luminous property. I claim as my\r\ninvention the herein described luminous substance, consisting of\r\ncalcined chalk, sulphur, and bismuth, substantially as set forth.\r\n\r\nMerrill B. Sherwood, Jr., of Buffalo, N. Y., obtained a patent for a\r\nphosphorescent composition, dated August 9, 1881.\r\n\r\nThe author says: My invention relates to an improvement in\r\nphosphorescent illuminants.\r\n\r\nI have taken advantage of the peculiar property which obtains in many\r\nbodies of absorbing light during the day and emitting it during the\r\nnight time.\r\n\r\nThe object of my invention is the preparation by a prescribed formula,\r\nto be hereinafter given, of a composition embodying one of the\r\nwell-known phosphorescent substances above referred to, which will be\r\napplicable to many practical uses.\r\n\r\nWith this end in view my invention consists in a phosphorescent\r\ncomposition in which the chief illuminating element is monosulphide of\r\ncalcium.\r\n\r\nThe composition obtained by the formula may be used either in a powdered\r\ncondition by dusting it over articles previously coated, in whole or in\r\npart, with an adhesive substance, or it may be intimately mixed with\r\npaints, inks, or varnishes, serving as vehicles for its application, and\r\nin this way be applied to bodies to render them luminous.\r\n\r\nThe formula for obtaining the composition is as follows: To one hundred\r\nparts of unslaked lime, that obtained from calcined oyster shells\r\nproducing the best results, add five parts of carbonate of magnesia and\r\nfive parts of ground silex. Introduce these elements into a graphite or\r\nfire-clay crucible containing forty parts of sulphur and twenty-five\r\nparts of charcoal, raise the whole mass nearly or quite to a white heat,\r\nremove from the fire, allow it to cool slowly, and, when it is cold or\r\nsufficiently lowered in temperature to be conveniently handled,\r\nremove it from the crucible and grind it. The method of reducing the\r\ncomposition will depend upon the mode of its use. If it is to be applied\r\nas a loose powder by the dusting process, it should be simply ground\r\ndry; but if it is to be mixed with paint or other similar substance,\r\nit should be ground with linseed or other suitable oil. In heating the\r\nelements aforesaid, certain chemical combinations will have taken place,\r\nand monosulphide of calcium, combined with carbonate of lime, magnesia,\r\nand silex, will be the result of such ignition.\r\n\r\nIf, in the firing of the elements, as above set forth, all of the\r\ncharcoal does not unite with the other elements, such uncombined portion\r\nshould be removed from the fused mass before it is ground.\r\n\r\nIf it is designed to mix the composition with paints, those composed of\r\nzinc-white and baryta should be chosen in preference to those composed\r\nof white lead and colored by vegetable matter, as chemical action will\r\ntake place between the composition and paint last mentioned, and\r\nits color will be destroyed or changed by the gradual action of the\r\nsulphureted hydrogen produced. However, by the addition of a weak\r\nsolution of gum in alcohol or other suitable sizing to the composition,\r\nit may be used with paints containing elements sensitive to sulphureted\r\nhydrogen without danger of decomposing them and destroying their color.\r\n\r\nIn many, and possibly in a majority of cases, the illuminating\r\ncomposition applied as a dry powder will give the most satisfactory\r\nresults, in view of the tendency to chemical action between the paint\r\nand composition when intimately mixed; in view of the fact that by\r\nthe addition to paint of any color of a sufficient quantity of the\r\ncomposition to render the product luminous, the original color of the\r\npaint will be modified or destroyed; and, also, in view of the fact that\r\nthe illuminating composition is so greatly in excess of the paint, the\r\nproportions in which they are united being substantially ten parts\r\nof the former to one of the latter, it will be difficult to impart a\r\nparticular color to the product of the union without detracting from\r\nits luminosity. On the other hand, the union of dry powder with a body\r\nalready painted by the simple force of adhesion does not establish\r\na sufficiently intimate relation between it and the paint to cause\r\nchemical action, the application of a light coat of powder does not\r\nmaterially change the color of the article to which it is applied; and,\r\nfurther, by the use of the powder in an uncombined state its greatest\r\nilluminating effects are obtained. Again, if the appearance in the\r\ndaytime of the article which it is desired to have appear luminous at\r\nnight is not material, it may be left unpainted and simply sized to\r\nretain the powder.\r\n\r\nIn printing it is probable that the composition will be employed almost\r\nexclusively in the form of dry powder, as printing-ink, normally pasty,\r\nbecomes too thick to be well handled when it is combined with powder in\r\nsufficient quantity to render the printed surface luminous. However, the\r\nprinted surface of a freshly printed sheet may be rendered luminous by\r\ndusting the sheet with powder, which will adhere to all of the inked and\r\nmay be easily shaken from the unmoistened surfaces thereof.\r\n\r\nI am aware that monosulphide of calcium and magnesia have before\r\nbeen used together in phosphorescent compounds. What I claim is a\r\nphosphorescent composition consisting of monosulphide of calcium,\r\ncombined with carbonate of lime, magnesia, and silex, substantially as\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nOrlando Thowless, of Newark, N.J., obtained a patent for a process of\r\nmanufacturing phosphorescent substances dated November 8, 1881.\r\nThe inventor says: The object of my invention is to manufacture\r\nphosphorescent materials of intense luminosity at low cost and little\r\nloss of materials.\r\n\r\nI first take clam shells and, after cleaning, place them in a solution\r\ncomposed of about one part of commercial nitric acid and three parts of\r\nwater, in which the shells are allowed to remain about twenty minutes.\r\nThe shells are then to be well rinsed in water, placed in a crucible,\r\nand heated to a red heat for about four hours. They are then removed and\r\nplaced, while still red-hot, in a saturated solution of sea salt, from\r\nwhich they are immediately removed and dried. After this treatment and\r\nexposure to light the shells will have a blood-red luminous appearance\r\nin the dark. The shells thus prepared are used with sulphur and\r\nthe phosphide and sulphide of calcium to produce a phosphorescent\r\ncomposition, as follows: One hundred parts, by weight, of the shells,\r\nprepared as above, are intimately mixed with twenty parts, by weight, of\r\nsulphur. This mixture is placed in a crucible or retort and heated to a\r\nwhite heat for four or five hours, when it is to be removed and forty\r\nparts more of sulphur, one and one-half parts of calcium phosphide, and\r\none-half part of chemically pure sulphide of calcium added. The mixture\r\nis then heated for about ninety minutes to an extreme white heat. When\r\ncold, and after exposure to light, this mixture will become luminous.\r\nInstead of these two ignitions, the same object may be in a measure\r\naccomplished by the addition of the full amount of sulphur with the\r\nphosphide and sulphide of calcium and raising it to a white heat but\r\nonce. The calcium phosphide is prepared by igniting phosphorus in\r\nconnection with newly slaked lime made chemically pure by calcination.\r\nThe condition of the shells when the sulphur is added is not material;\r\nbut the heat renders them porous and without moisture, so that they will\r\nabsorb the salt to as great an extent as possible. Where calcined shells\r\nare mixed with solid salt, the absorbing power of the shells is greatly\r\ndiminished by the necessary exposure, and there will be a lack of\r\nuniformity in the saturation. On the contrary, by plunging the red-hot\r\nshells in the saline solution the greatest uniformity is attained.\r\n\r\nInstead of using clam shells as the base of my improved composition, I\r\nmay use other forms of sea shells--such as oyster shells, etc.\r\n\r\nI claim as new:\r\n\r\n1. The herein described process of manufacturing phosphorescent\r\nmaterials, which consists in heating sea shells red-hot, treating them\r\nwhile heated with a bath of brine, then, after removal from the bath,\r\nmixing sulphur and phosphide and sulphide of calcium therewith, and\r\nfinally subjecting the mixture to a white heat, substantially as and for\r\nthe purpose described.\r\n\r\n2. The described process, which consists in placing clean and red-hot\r\nclam shells in a saturated solution of sea salt, and then drying them,\r\nfor the purpose specified.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOXWOOD AND ITS SUBSTITUTES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Prize essay written for the International Forestry\r\nExhibition, Edinburgh.]\r\n\r\nBy JOHN R. JACKSON. A.L.S., Curator of the Museums, Royal Gardens, Ken.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of the discovery of a hard, compact, and even grained\r\nwood, having all the characteristics of boxwood, and for which it would\r\nform an efficient substitute, cannot be overestimated; and if such\r\na discovery should be one of the results of the present Forestry\r\nExhibition, one of its aims will have been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nFor several years past the gradual diminution in the supplies of\r\nboxwood, and the deterioration in its quality, have occupied the\r\nattention of hardwood merchants, of engravers, and of scientific men.\r\n\r\nOf merchants, because of the difficulties in obtaining supplies to meet\r\nthe ever increasing demand; of engravers, because of the higher prices\r\nasked for the wood, and the difficulty of securing wood of good size and\r\nfirm texture, so that the artistic excellence of the engraving might be\r\nmaintained; and of the man of science, who was specially interested\r\nin the preservation of the indigenous boxwood forests, and in the\r\nutilization of other woods, natives, it might be, of far distant\r\ncountries, whose adaptation would open not only a new source of revenue,\r\nbut would also be the means of relieving the strain upon existing\r\nboxwood forests.\r\n\r\nWhile by far the most important use of boxwood is for engraving\r\npurposes, it must be borne in mind that the wood is also applied to\r\nnumerous other uses, such, for instance, as weaving shuttles, for\r\nmathematical instruments, turnery purposes, carving, and for various\r\nornamental articles, as well as for inlaying in cabinet work. The\r\nquestion, therefore, of finding suitable substitutes for boxwood divides\r\nitself into two branches, first, directly for engraving purposes, and,\r\nsecondly, to supply its place for the other uses to which it is now put.\r\nThis, to a certain extent, might set free some of the boxwood so used,\r\nand leave it available for the higher purposes of art. At the same time,\r\nit must not be forgotten that much of the wood used for general purposes\r\nis unsuited for engraving, and can only therefore be used by the turner\r\nor cabinet maker. Nevertheless, the application of woods other than box\r\nfor purposes for which that wood is now used would tend to lessen the\r\ndemand for box, and thus might have an effect in lowering the price.\r\n\r\nSo far back as 1875 a real uneasiness began to be felt as to the future\r\nsupplies of box. In the _Gardeners' Chronicle_ for September 25, of that\r\nyear, page 398, it is said that the boxwood forests of Mingrelia in the\r\nCaucasian range were almost exhausted. Old forests, long abandoned, were\r\neven then explored in search of trees that might have escaped the notice\r\nof former proprietors, and wood that was rejected by them was, in 1875,\r\neagerly purchased at high prices for England. The export of wood was at\r\nthat time prohibited from Abhasia and all the government forests in\r\nthe Caucasus. A report, dated at about the same period from Trebizond,\r\npoints out that the Porte had prohibited the cutting of boxwood in the\r\ncrown forests. (_Gardeners' Chronicle_, Aug. 19, 1876, p. 239.) Later\r\non, the British Consul at Tiflis says: \"_Bona fide_ Caucasian boxwood\r\nmay be said to be commercially non-existent, almost every marketable\r\ntree having been exported.\" (_Gardeners' Chronicle_, Dec. 6, 1879, p.\r\n726.)\r\n\r\nThe characters of boxwood are so marked and so distinct from those of\r\nmost other woods that some extracts from a report of Messrs. J. Gardner\r\n& Sons, of London and Liverpool, addressed to the Inspector-General of\r\nForests in India, bearing on this subject, will not be without value;\r\nindeed, its more general circulation than its reprint in Mr. J.S.\r\nGamble's \"Manual of Indian Timbers\" will, it is hoped, be the means of\r\ndirecting attention to this very important matter, and by pointing\r\nout the characters that make boxwood so valuable, may be the means of\r\ndirecting observation to the detection of similar characters in other\r\nwoods. Messrs. Gardner say:\r\n\r\n\"The most suitable texture of wood will be found growing upon the sides\r\nof mountains. If grown in the plains the growth is usually too quick,\r\nand consequently the grain is too coarse, the wood of best texture being\r\nof slow growth, and very fine in the grain.\r\n\r\n\"It should be cut down in the winter, and, if possible, stored at once\r\nin airy wooden sheds well protected from sun and rain, and not to have\r\ntoo much air through the sides of the sheds, more especially for the\r\nwood under four inches diameter.\r\n\r\n\"The boxwood also must not be piled upon the ground, but be well skidded\r\nunder, so as to be kept quite free from the effects of any damp from the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n\"After the trees are cut down, the longer they are exposed the more\r\ndanger is there afterward of the wood splitting more than is absolutely\r\nnecessary during the necessary seasoning before shipment to this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"If shipped green, there is great danger of the wood sweating and\r\nbecoming mildewed during transit, which causes the wood afterward to dry\r\nlight and of a defective color, and in fact rendering it of little value\r\nfor commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n\"There is no occasion to strip the bark off or to put cowdung or\r\nanything else upon the ends of the pieces to prevent their splitting.\r\n\r\n\"Boxwood is the nearest approach to ivory of any wood known, and will,\r\ntherefore, probably gradually increase in value, as it, as well\r\nas ivory, becomes scarcer. It is now used very considerably in\r\nmanufacturing concerns, but on account of its gradual advance in price\r\nduring the past few years, cheaper woods are in some instances being\r\nsubstituted.\r\n\r\n\"Small wood under four inches is used principally by flax spinners for\r\nrollers, and by turners for various purposes, rollers for rink skates,\r\netc., etc., and if free from splits, is of equal value with the larger\r\nwood. It is imported here as small as one a half inches in diameter, but\r\nthe most useful sizes are from 2½ to 3½ inches, and would therefore,\r\nwe suppose, be from fifteen to thirty or forty years in growing, while\r\nlarger wood would require fifty years and upward at least, perhaps we\r\nought to say one hundred years and upward. It is used principally for\r\nshuttles, for weaving silk, linen, and cotton, and also for rule making\r\nand wood engraving. _Punch, The Illustrated London News, The Graphic_,\r\nand all the first class pictorial papers use large quantities of\r\nboxwood.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1880, Messrs. Churchill and Sim reported favorably on some\r\nconsignments of Indian boxwood, concluding with the remarks that if the\r\nwood could be regularly placed on the market at a moderate figure, there\r\nwas no reason why a trade should not be developed in it. Notwithstanding\r\nthese prospects, which seemed promising in 1877 and 1880, little or\r\nnothing has been accually done up to the present time in bringing Indian\r\nboxwood into general use, in consequence, as Mr. Gamble shows, of\r\nthe cost of transit through India. The necessity, therefore, of the\r\ndiscovery of some wood akin to box is even more important now than ever\r\nit was.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOXWOOD SUBSTITUTES.\r\n\r\nFirst among the substitutes that have been proposed to replace boxwood\r\nmay be mentioned an invention of Mr. Edward Badoureau, referred to in\r\nthe _Gardeners' Chronicle_, March 23, 1878, p. 374, under the title of\r\nartificial boxwood. It is stated to consist of some soft wood which has\r\nbeen subject to heavy pressure. It is stated that some English engravers\r\nhave given their opinion on this prepared wood as follows:\r\n\r\nIt has not the power of resistance of boxwood, so that it would be\r\nimposible to make use of it, except in the shape of an electro obtained\r\nfrom it, as it is too soft to sustain the pressure of a machine, and\r\nwould be easily worn out. In reply to these opinions, Mr. Badoureau\r\nwrote: \"My wood resists the wear and tear of the press as well as\r\nboxwood, and I can show engravings of English and French artists which\r\nhave been obtained direct from the wood, and are as perfect as they are\r\npossible to be; several of them have been drawn by Mr. Gustave Dore.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Badoureau further says that \"while as an engraver he has so high an\r\nopinion of the qualities of compressed wood as a substitute for boxwood,\r\nas the inventor of the new process he considered that it possesses\r\nnumerous advantages both for artistic and industrial purposes.\" In\r\nshort, he says, \"My wood is to other wood what steel is to iron.\"\r\n\r\nThe following woods are those which have, from time to time, been\r\nproposed or experimented upon as substitutes for boxwood, for engraving\r\npurposes. They are arranged according to their scientific classification\r\nin the natural orders to which they belong:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Order Pittosporeæ_.\r\n\r\n1. _Pittosporum undulatum_. Vent.--A tree growing in favorable\r\nsituations to a height of forty or even sixty feet, and is a native of\r\nNew South Wales and Victoria. It furnishes a light, even grained wood,\r\nwhich attracted some attention at the International Exhibition in 1862;\r\nblocks were prepared from it, and submitted to Prof. De la Motte, of\r\nKing's College, who reported as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I consider this wood well adapted to certain kinds of wood engraving.\r\nIt is not equal to Turkey box, but it is superior to that generally used\r\nfor posters, and I have no doubt that it would answer for the rollers\r\nof mangles and wringing machines.\" Mr. W.G. Smith, in a report in the\r\n_Gardeners' Chronicle_ for July 26, 1873, p. 1017, on some foreign woods\r\nwhich I submitted to him for trial, says that the wood of _Pittosporum\r\nundulatum_ is suitable only for bold outlines; compared with box, it is\r\nsoft and tough, and requires more force to cut than box. The toughness\r\nof the wood causes the tools to drag back, so that great care is\r\nrequired in cutting to prevent the lines clipping. The average diameter\r\nof the wood is from 18 to 30 inches.\r\n\r\n2. _Pittosporum bicolor_, Hook.--A closely allied species, sometimes\r\nforty feet high, native of New South Wales and Tasmania. This wood is\r\nstated to be decidedly superior to the last named.\r\n\r\n3. _Bursaria spinosa_, Cav.--A tree about forty feet high, native of\r\nNorth, South, and West Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria,\r\nand Tasmania, in which island it is known as boxwood. It has been\r\nreported upon as being equal to common or inferior box, and with\r\nfurther trials might be found suitable for common subjects; it has the\r\ndisadvantage, however, of blunting the edges and points of the tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Order Meliaceæ_.\r\n\r\n4. _Swietenia mahagoni_, L. (mahogany).--A large timber tree of\r\nHonduras, Cuba, Central America, and Mexico. It is one of the most\r\nvaluable of furniture woods, but for engraving purposes it is but of\r\nlittle value, nevertheless it has been used for large, coarse subjects.\r\nSpanish mahogany is the kind which has been so used.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Order Ilicineæ_.\r\n\r\n_Ilex opaca_, L. (North American holly).--It is a widely diffused tree,\r\nthe wood of which is said to closely resemble English holly, being white\r\nin color, and hard, with a fine grain, so that it is used for a\r\ngreat number of purposes by turners, engineers, cabinet makers, and\r\nphilosophical instrument makers. For engraving purposes it is not equal\r\nto the dog-wood of America (_Cornus florida_); it yields, however, more\r\nreadily to the graver's tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Order Celastrineæ_.\r\n\r\n6. _Elæodendron australe_, Vent.--A tree twenty to twenty-five feet\r\nhigh, native of Queensland and New South Wales. The wood is used in the\r\ncolony for turning and cabinet work, and Mr. W.G. Smith reports that for\r\nengraving purposes it seems suitable only for rough work, as diagrams,\r\nposters, etc.\r\n\r\n7. _Euonymus sieboldianus_, Blume.--A Chinese tree, where the wood,\r\nwhich is known as pai'cha, is used for carving and engraving. Attention\r\nwas first drawn to this wood by Mr. Jean von Volxem, in the _Gardeners'\r\nChronicle_ for April 20, 1878. In the Kew Report for 1878, p. 41, the\r\nfollowing extract of a letter from Mr. W.M. Cooper, Her Majesty's Consul\r\nat Ningpo, is given: \"The wood in universal use for book blocks, wood\r\nengravings, seals, etc., is that of the pear tree, of which large\r\nquantities are grown in Shantung, and Shan-se, especially. Pai'cha is\r\nsometimes used as an indifferent substitute. Pai'cha is a very fine\r\nwhite wood of fine fiber, without apparent grains, and cuts easily; is\r\nwell suited for carved frames, cabinets, caskets, etc., for which large\r\nquantities are manufactured here for export. The tree itself resembles\r\nsomewhat the _Stillingia_, but has a rougher bark, larger and thinner\r\nleaves, which are serrated at the edge, more delicate twigs, and is\r\ndeciduous.\" In 1879, a block of this wood was received at the Kew\r\nMuseum, from Mr. Cooper, a specimen of which was submitted to Mr. Robson\r\nJ. Scott, of Whitefriars Street, to whom I am much indebted for reports\r\non various occasions, and upon this wood Mr. Scott reported as follows:\r\n\"The most striking quality I have observed in this wood is its capacity\r\nfor retaining water, and the facility with which it surrenders it. This\r\nsection (one prepared and sent to the Kew Museum), which represents\r\none-tenth of the original piece, weighed 3 lb. 4½ ounces. At the end of\r\ntwenty one days it had lost 1 lb. 6¾ ounces in an unheated chamber. At\r\nthe end of another fourteen days, in a much elevated temperature, it\r\nonly lost ¼ ounce. In its present state of reduced bulk its weight is 1\r\nlb. 10 ounces. It is not at all likely to supersede box, but it may be\r\nfit for coarser work than that for which box is necessary.\" Later on,\r\nnamely in the Kew Report for 1880, p. 51, Mr. R.D. Keene, an engraver,\r\nto whom Mr. Scott submitted specimens of the wood for trial, writes: \"I\r\nlike the wood very much, and prefer it to box in some instances; it is\r\nfreer to work, and consequently quicker, and its being uniform in color\r\nand quality is a great advantage; we often have great difficulty in\r\nbox in having to work from a hard piece into a soft. I think it a very\r\nuseful wood, especially for solid bold work. I question if you could get\r\nso extreme a fine black line as on box, but am sure there would be a\r\nlarge demand for it at a moderate price.\" Referring to this letter, Mr.\r\nScott remarks that the writer does not intend it to be understood that\r\npai'cha is qualified to supersede box, but for inferior subjects for\r\nwhich coarse brittle box is used. Mr. Scott further says that of the\r\nwoods he has tried he prefers pear and hawthorn to pai'cha.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Order Sapindaceæ_.\r\n\r\n8. _Acer saccharinum_, L. (sugar or bird's eye maple).--A North American\r\ntree, forming extensive forests in Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova\r\nScotia. The wood is well known as a cabinet or furniture wood. It has\r\nbeen tried for engraving, but it does not seem to have attracted much\r\nnotice. Mr. Scott says it is sufficiently good, so far as the grain is\r\nconcerned. From this it would seem not to promise favorably.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Order Leguminoseæ. Sub-order Papilionaceæ_.\r\n\r\n9. _Brya ebenus_, [Delta]. DC.--A small tree of Jamaica, where the wood\r\nis known as green ebony, and is used for making various small articles.\r\nIt is imported into this country under the name of cocus wood, and\r\nis used with us for making flutes and other wind instruments. Mr.\r\nWorthington Smith considers that the wood equals bad box for engraving\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Order Rosaceæ_.\r\n\r\n10. _Pyrus communis_, L. (common pear).--A tree averaging from 20 to 40\r\nfeet high. Found in a wild state, and very extensively cultivated as a\r\nfruit tree. The wood is of a light brown color, and somewhat resembles\r\nlimewood in grain. It is, however, harder and tougher. It is considered\r\na good wood for carving, because it can be cut with or across the grain\r\nwith equal facility. It stands well when well seasoned, and is used for\r\nengraved blocks for calico printers, paper stainers, and for various\r\nother purposes. Pear-wood has been tried for engraving purposes, but\r\nwith no great success. Mr. Scott's opinion of its relative value is\r\nreferred to under pai'cha wood _(Euonymus sieboldianus)_.\r\n\r\n11. _Amelanchier canadensis_. L. (shade tree or service tree of\r\nAmerica).--A shrub or small tree found throughout Canada, Newfoundland,\r\nand Virginia. Of this wood, Porcher says, in his \"Resources of the\r\nSouthern Fields and Forests\": \"Upon examining with a sharp instrument\r\nthe specimens of various southern woods deposited in the museum of the\r\nElliott Society, ... I was struck with the singular weight, density, and\r\nfineness of this wood. I think I can confidently recommend it as one of\r\nthe best to be experimented upon by the wood engraver.\"\r\n\r\n12. _Cratoegus oxyacantha_, L. (hawthorn).--A well-known shrub or small\r\ntree in forests and hedges in this country. The wood is very dense and\r\nclose grained. Of this wood, Mr. Scott reports that it is by far the\r\nbest wood after box that he has had the opportunity of testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Order Myrtaceæ_.\r\n\r\n13. _Eugenia procera_, Poir.--A tree 20 to 30 feet high, native of\r\nJamaica, Antigua, Martinique, and Santa Cruz. A badly seasoned sample\r\nof this wood was submitted to Mr. R.H. Keene, who reported that \"it is\r\nsuited for bold, solid newspaper work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Order Cornaceæ_.\r\n\r\n14. _Cornus florida_, L. (North American dogwood).--A deciduous tree,\r\nabout 30 feet high, common in the woods in various parts of North\r\nAmerica. The wood is hard, heavy, and very fine grained. It is used in\r\nAmerica for making the handles of light tools, as mallets, plane stocks,\r\nharrow teeth, cogwheels, etc. It has also been used in America for\r\nengraving.\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Prof. Sargent, Director of the Arnold Arboretum,\r\nBrookline, Massachusetts, quoted in the Kew Report for 1882, p. 35, he\r\nsays: \"I have been now, for a long time, examining our native woods\r\nin the hope of finding something to take the place of boxwood for\r\nengraving, but so far I am sorry to say with no very brilliant success.\r\nThe best work here is entirely done from boxwood, and some _Cornus\r\nflorida_ is used for less expensive engraving. This wood answers fairly\r\nwell for coarse work, but it is a difficult wood to manage, splitting,\r\nor rather 'checking,' very badly in drying.\" This, however, he states in\r\na later letter, \"can be overcome by sawing the logs through the center\r\nas soon as cut. It can be obtained in large quantities.\" Mr. R.H. Keene,\r\nthe engraver before referred to, reports that the wood is very rough,\r\nand suitable for bold work.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Order Ericaceæ_.\r\n\r\n15. _Rhododendron maximum_, L. (mountain laurel of North America).--Of\r\nthis wood it is stated in Porcher's \"Resources of the Southern Fields\r\nand Forests,\" p. 419, that upon the authority of a well-known engraver\r\nat Nashville, Tennessee, the wood is equaled only by the best boxwood.\r\nThis species of _Rhododendron_ \"abounds on every mountain from Mason and\r\nDixon's line to North Georgia that has a rocky branch.\" Specimens of\r\nthis wood submitted to Mr. Scott were so badly selected and seasoned\r\nthat it was almost impossible to give it a trial. In consideration of\r\nits hardness and apparent good qualities, further experiments should be\r\nmade with it.\r\n\r\n16. _Rhododendron californicum_.--Likewise a North American species, the\r\nwood of which is similar to the last named. Specimens were sent to Kew\r\nby Professor Sargent for report in 1882, but were so badly seasoned that\r\nno satisfactory opinion could be obtained regarding it.\r\n\r\n17. _Kalmia latifolia_, L. (calico bush or ivy bush of North\r\nAmerica).--The wood is hard and dense, and is much used in America for\r\nmechanical purposes. It has been recommended as a substitute for boxwood\r\nfor engraving, and trials should, therefore, be made with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Order Epacrideæ_.\r\n\r\n18. _Monotoca elliptica_, R. Br.--A tall shrub or tree 20 or 30 feet\r\nhigh, native of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania.\r\nThe wood has been experimented upon in this country, and though to all\r\nappearances it is an excellent wood, yet Mr. Worthington Smith reported\r\nupon it as having a bad surface, and readily breaking away so that the\r\ncuts require much retouching after engraving.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Order Ebenaceæ_.\r\n\r\n19. _Diospyros texana_.--A North American tree, of the wood of which\r\nProfessor Sargent speaks favorably. \"It is, however,\" he says, \"in\r\nTexas, at least, rather small, scarcely six inches in diameter, and not\r\nvery common. In northern Mexico it is said to grow much larger, and\r\ncould probably be obtained with some trouble in sufficient quantities\r\nto become an article of commerce.\" Of this wood Mr. Scott says: \"It is\r\nsufficiently good as regards the grain, but the specimen sent for\r\ntrial was much too small for practical purposes.\" Mr. R.H. Keene, the\r\nengraver, says it \"is nearly equal to the best box.\"\r\n\r\n20. _Diospyros virginiana_, L. (the persimmon of America).--A good-sized\r\ntree, widely diffused, and common in some districts. The wood is of a\r\nvery dark color, hard, and of a fairly close grain. It has been used in\r\nAmerica for engraving, but so far as I am aware has not been tried\r\nin this country. It has, however, been lately introduced for making\r\nshuttles.\r\n\r\n21. _Dyospyros ebenum_, Koenig (ebony).--A wood so well known as to\r\nneed no description. It has been tried for engraving by Mr. Worthington\r\nSmith, who considers it nearly as good as box.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Order Apocyneæ_.\r\n\r\n22. _Hunteria zeylanica_, Gard.--A small tree, common in the warmer\r\nparts of Ceylon. This is a very hard and compact wood, and is used for\r\nengraving purposes in Ceylon, where it is said, by residents, to come\r\nnearer to box than any other wood known. On this wood Mr. Worthington\r\nSmith gave a very favorable opinion, but it is doubtful whether it would\r\never be brought from Ceylon in sufficient quantities to meet a demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Order Bignoniaceæ_.\r\n\r\n23. _Tecoma pentaphylla_, Dl.--A moderate-sized tree, native of the West\r\nIndies and Brazil. The wood is compact, very fine, and even grained, and\r\nmuch resembles box in general appearance. Blocks for engraving have been\r\nprepared from it by Mr. R.J. Scott, who reported upon it as follows: \"It\r\nis the only likely successor to box that I have yet seen, but it is not\r\nembraced as a deliverer should be, but its time may not be far off.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Order Corylaceæ_.\r\n\r\n24. _Carpinus betulus_, L. (hornbeam).--A tree from 20 to 70 feet high,\r\nwith a trunk sometimes 10 feet in girth, indigenous in the southern\r\ncounties of England. The wood is very tough, heavy, and close grained.\r\nIt is largely used in France for handles for agricultural and mining\r\nimplements, and of late years has been much used in this country for\r\nlasts. The wood of large growth is apt to became shaky, and it is\r\nconsequently not used as a building wood. It is said to have been used\r\nas a substitute for box in engraving, but with what success does not\r\nappear.\r\n\r\n25. _Ostrya virginica_, Willd (ironwood, or American hornbeam).--A\r\nmoderate-sized tree, widely spread over North America. The wood is\r\nlight-colored, and extremely hard and heavy; hence the name of ironwood.\r\nIt is used in America by turners, as well as for mill cogs, etc., and\r\nhas been suggested as a substitute for boxwood for engraving, though no\r\nactual trials, so far as I am aware, have been made with it.\r\n\r\nBesides the foregoing list of woods, there are others that have been\r\noccasionally used for posters and the coarser kinds of engraving, such,\r\nfor instance, as lime, sycamore, yew, beech, and even pine; and in\r\nAmerica, _Vaccinium arboreum_ and _Azalea nudiflora_. Of these, however,\r\nbut little is known as to their value.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that in those woods that have passed through the\r\nengraver's hands, some which promised best, so far as their texture\r\nor grain is concerned, have been tried upon very imperfect or badly\r\nseasoned samples.\r\n\r\nThe subject is one of so much importance, as was pointed out at the\r\ncommencement of this paper, that a thoroughly organized series of\r\nexperiments should be undertaken upon carefully seasoned and properly\r\nprepared woods, not only of those mentioned in the preceding list, but\r\nalso of any others that may suggest themselves, as being suitable, It\r\nmust, moreover, always be borne in mind that the questions of price,\r\nand the considerations of supply and demand, must, to a great extent,\r\nregulate the adaptation of any particular wood.\r\n\r\nWith regard to those woods referred to as being tried by Mr. Worthington\r\nSmith, he remarks in his report that any of them would be useful for\r\nsome classes of work, if they could be imported, prepared, and sold for\r\na farthing, or less than a halfpenny, per square inch.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of all the woods here enumerated are contained in the Kew\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITE PORTRAITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long since we gave a figure from a drawing by Mr. Grallieni, which,\r\nlooked at from a distance, seemed to be a death's head, but which, when\r\nexamined more closely, was seen to represent two children caressing\r\na dog. Since then we have had occasion to publish some landscapes of\r\nKircher and his imitators, which, looked at sideways, exhibited human\r\nprofiles. This sort of amusement has exercised the skill of artists of\r\nall times, and engravings, and even paintings, of double aspect are very\r\nnumerous. Chance has recently put into our hands a very curious work of\r\nthis kind, which is due to a skillful artist named Gaillot. It is an\r\nalbum of quite ancient lithographs, which was published at Berlin by\r\nSenefelder. The author, under the title of \"Arts and Trades,\" has drawn\r\nsome very amusing faces that are formed through the tools and objects\r\nused in the profession represented. We reproduce a few specimens of\r\nthese essentially original compositions of Gaillot. The green grocer is\r\nformed of a melon for the head, of an artichoke and its stem for the\r\nforehead and nose, of a pannier for the bust, etc. The hunter is made up\r\nof a gun, of a powder horn, and of a hunting horn, etc.; and so on for\r\nthe other professions. This is an amusing exercise in drawing that we\r\nhave thought worthy of reproducing. Any one who is skillful with his\r\npencil might exercise himself in imagining other compositions of the\r\nsame kind.--_La Nature_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPOSITE PORTRAITS.--OCCUPATIONS. 1.

GILMAN, President of the Johns Hopkins University,\r\nBaltimore.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot think of a theme more fit for this hour and place than\r\nhandy-craft. I begin by saying \"handy-craft,\" for that is the form of\r\nthe word now in vogue, that which we are wonted to see in print and hear\r\nin speech; but I like rather the old form, \"hand-craft,\" which was used\r\nby our sires so long ago as the Anglo-Saxon days. Both words mean the\r\nsame thing, the power of the hand to seize, hold, shape, match, carve,\r\npaint, dig, bake, make, or weave. Neither form is in fashion, as we know\r\nvery well, for people choose nowadays such Latin words as \"technical\r\nability,\" \"manual labor,\" \"industrial pursuits,\" \"dexterity,\"\r\n\"professional artisanship,\" \"manufacture,\" \"decorative art,\" and\r\n\"technological occupations,\" not one of which is half as good as the\r\nplain, old, strong term \"hand-craft.\"\r\n\r\nAn aid to hand-craft is rede-craft--the power to read, to reason, and to\r\nthink; or, as it is said in the book of Common Prayer, \"to read, mark,\r\nlearn, and inwardly digest.\" By rede craft we find out what other men\r\nhave done; we get our book learning, we are made heirs to thoughts that\r\nbreathe and words that burn, we enter into the life, the acts, the arts,\r\nthe loves, the lore of the wise, the witty, the cunning, and the worthy\r\nof all ages and all places; we learn, as says the peasant poet of\r\nScotland,\r\n\r\n  \"The song whose thunderous chime\r\n    Eternal echoes render--\r\n  The mournful Tuscan's haunted rhyme,\r\n    And Milton's starry splendor!\"\r\n\r\nI do not pit rede-craft against hand-craft. Quite otherwise, I call them\r\nnot foes (as some would), but friends. They are brothers, partners,\r\nconsorts, who can work together, as right hand and left hand, as science\r\nand art, as theory and practice. Rede-craft may call for books and\r\nhand-craft for tools, but it is by the help of both books and tools that\r\nmankind moves on. Indeed, we shall not err wide of the mark if we say\r\nthat a book is a tool, for it is the instrument which we make use of in\r\ncertain cases when we wish to find out what other men have thought and\r\ndone. Perhaps you will not be as ready to admit that a tool is a book.\r\nBut take for example the plow. Compare the form in use to-day on a\r\nfirst-rate farm with that which is pictured on ancient stones long hid\r\nin Egypt--ages old. See how the idea of the plow has grown, and bear in\r\nmind that its graceful curves, it fitness for a special soil, or for\r\na special crop, its labor-saving shape, came not by chance, but by\r\nthought. Indeed, a plow is made up from the thoughts and toils of\r\ngenerations of plowmen. Look at a Collins ax; it is also the record\r\nof man's thought. Lay it side by side with the hatchet of Uncas or\r\nMiantonomoh, or with an ax of the age of bronze, and think how many\r\nminds have worked on the head and on the helve, how much skill has been\r\nspent in getting the metal, in making it hard, in shaping the edge, in\r\nfixing the weight, in forming the handle. From simple tools, turn to\r\ncomplex; to the printing press, the sewing machine, the locomotive,\r\nthe telegraph, the ocean steamer; all are full of ideas. All are the\r\noffspring of hand-craft and rede craft, of skill and thought, of\r\npractice put on record, of science and art.\r\n\r\nNow, the welfare of each one of us, the welfare of our land, the welfare\r\nof our race, rests on this union. You may almost take the measure of a\r\nman's brain, if you can find out what he sees with his eyes and what he\r\ndoes with hands; you may judge of a country, or of a city, if you know\r\nwhat it makes.\r\n\r\nI do not know that we need ask which is best, hand-craft or rede-craft.\r\nCertainly \"the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee.\" At\r\ntimes, hand-craft becomes rede-craft, for when the eye is blind the hand\r\ntakes its place, and the finger learns to read, running over the printed\r\npage to find out what is written, as quickly as the eye.\r\n\r\nIn these days, there are too many who look down on hand-craft. They\r\nthink only of the tasks of a drudge or a char-boy. They do not know the\r\npleasure there is in working, and especially in making. They have never\r\nlearned to guide the fingers by the brain. They like to hear, or see, or\r\nown, or eat, what others have made, but they do not like to put their\r\nown hands to work. If you doubt what I say, put a notice in the paper\r\nasking for a clerk, and you will have a, hundred answers for every one\r\nthat will come when you ask for a workman. So it comes to pass that\r\nyoung men grow up whose hands have not been trained to any kind of\r\nskill; they wish, therefore, to be buyers and sellers, traders, dealers,\r\nand so the market is overstocked with clerks, book-keepers, salesmen,\r\nand small shop-keepers, while it is understocked in all the higher walks\r\nof hand-craft. Some men can only get on by force of arms, lifting,\r\npounding, heaving, or by power of sitting at counter or a desk and\r\n\"clerking it.\"\r\n\r\nMachinery works against hand-craft. In many branches of labor, the hand\r\nnow has but little to do, and that little is always the same, so that\r\nlabor becomes tiresome and the workman dull. Machines can be made to cut\r\nstatuary, to weave beautiful tapestry, to fashion needles, to grind\r\nout music, to make long calculations; alas! the machine has also\r\nbeen brought into politics. Of course, a land cannot thrive without\r\nmachinery; it is that mechanical giant, the steam engine, which carries\r\nthe corn, the cotton, and the sugar from our rich valleys to the hungry\r\nof other lands, and brings back to us the product of their looms.\r\nNevertheless, he who lives by the machine alone lives but half a life;\r\nwhile he who uses his hand to contrive and to adorn drives dullness from\r\nhis path. A true artist and a true artisan are one. Hand-craft, the\r\npower to shape, to curve, to beautify, to create, gives pleasure and\r\ndignity to labor.\r\n\r\nIn other times and in other lands, hand-craft has had more honor than it\r\nhas had with us. Let me give some examples. Not long ago, I went to one\r\nof the shrines of education, the Sorbonne in Paris. Two paintings adorn\r\nthe chapel walls, not of saints or martyrs, nor of apostles or\r\nprophets, perhaps I should say of both saints and prophets, _Labor_ and\r\n_Humilitas_, Industry and Modesty.\r\n\r\nThe touch of Phidias was his own, and so inimitable that a few months\r\nago, an American, scanning, with his practiced eye, the galleries of the\r\nLouvre, recognized a fragment of the work of Phidias, long separated\r\nfrom the Parthenon frieze which Lord Elgin sent to London. The\r\nsculptor's touch could not be mistaken. It was as truly his own as his\r\nsignature, his autograph. Ruskin, in a lecture on the relation of Art to\r\nMorals, calls attention to a note which Durer made on some drawings sent\r\nhim by Raphael: \"These figures Raphael drew and sent to Albert Durer\r\nin Nurnberg, to show him his hand, '_sein hand zu weisen_.\"' Ruskin\r\ncompares this phrase with other contests of hand-craft, Apelles and\r\nProtogenes showing their skill by drawing a line; Giotto in striking a\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nIn the household of the Kings of Prussia, there is a custom, if not\r\na law, that every boy shall learn a trade. I believe this is a fact,\r\nthough I have no certain proof of it. The Emperor Wilhelm is said to be\r\na glazier, the Crown Prince a compositor, and on the Emperor's birthday\r\nnot long ago his majesty received an engraving by Prince Henry and a,\r\nbook bound by Prince Waldemar, two younger sons of the Crown Prince. Let\r\nme refer to sacred writ; the prophet Isaiah, telling of the golden days\r\nwhich are to come, when the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in\r\nthe land, nor the voice of crying, when the child shall die an hundred\r\nyears old, and men shall eat of the fruit of the vineyards they have\r\nplanted, adds this striking promise, as the culm of all hope, that the\r\nelect of the Lord shall long enjoy the work of their hands.\r\n\r\nNow, in view of what has been said, my first point is this: We who have\r\nto deal with the young, we all who love our fellow-men, we all who\r\ndesire that our times, our city, our country, should be thrifty, happy,\r\nand content, must each in his place and way give high honor to labor.\r\nWe, especially, who are teachers and parents, should see to it that the\r\nyoung get \"hand-craft\" while they are getting \"rede-craft.\" How can this\r\nbe done?\r\n\r\nMothers begin right in the nursery, teaching little fingers to play\r\nbefore the tongue can lisp a sentence. Alas! this natural training has\r\noften been stopped at school. Hitherto, until quite lately, in schools\r\nboth low and high, rede-craft has had the place of honor, hand-craft has\r\nhad no chance. But a change is coming. In the highest of all schools,\r\nuniversities, for example, work rooms, labor places, \"laboratories,\" are\r\nnow thought to be as useful as book rooms, reading rooms, libraries.\r\n\r\nWhat mean those buildings which you have seen spring up within a few\r\nyears past in all the college greens of New England? They are libraries\r\nand laboratories. They show that rede-craft and hand-craft are alike\r\nheld in honor, and that a liberal education means skill in getting and\r\nskill in using knowledge; that knowledge comes from searching books and\r\nsearching nature; that the brain and the hand are in close league. So\r\ntoo, in the lowest school, as far as possible from the university, the\r\nkindergarten has won its place and the blocks, and straws, and bands,\r\nthe chalk, the clay, the scissors, are in use to make young fingers\r\ndeft. Between the highest and the lowest schools there is a like call\r\nfor hand-craft. Seeing this need, the authorities in our public schools\r\nhave begun to project special schools for such training, and are looking\r\nfor guidance far and near. At this intermediate stage, for boy and girls\r\nwho are between the age of the kindergarten and the age of the college\r\nor the shop, for youth between eight and sixteen, there is much to be\r\ndone; people are hardly aware how much is needed to secure fit training\r\nfor the rising generation.\r\n\r\nIt seems sometimes as if one of the most needed forms of hand-craft\r\nwould become a lost art, even good handwriting. We cannot give much\r\ncredit to schools if they send out many who are skilled in algebra, or\r\nin Latin, but who cannot write a page of English so that it can be read\r\nwithout effort.\r\n\r\nDrawing is another kind of hand-craft, quite too much neglected. I think\r\nit should be laid down as a law of the road to knowledge, that everybody\r\nmust learn to draw as well as to write. The pencil maybe mastered just\r\nas readily as the pen. It is a simpler tool. The child draws before\r\nhe writes, and savages begin their language with pictures; but, we\r\nwiseacres of this age of books let our young folks drop their slate\r\npencils and their Fabers, and practice with their Gillotts and their\r\nEsterbrooks. Let us say, in every school and in every house, the child\r\nmust not only learn to read and write, he must learn to draw. We cannot\r\nafford to let our young folks grow up without this power. A new French\r\nbook is just now much talked about, with this droll title, \"The Life\r\nof a Wise Man, by an Ignoramus.\" It is the story of the great Pasteur,\r\nwhose discoveries in respect to life have made him world renowned. I\r\nturned to the book, eager to find out the key to such success, and\r\nI found the old story--\"the child was father of the man.\" This\r\nphilosopher, whose eye is so skilled in observing nature, and whose hand\r\nis so apt in experiments, is the boy grown up whose pictures were so\r\ngood that the villagers thought him at thirteen an artist of rank.\r\n\r\nGirls should learn the first lesson of hand-craft with the needle; boys\r\nmay (and they will always prize the knowledge), but girls must. It is\r\nwise that our schools are going back to old fashioned ways, and saying\r\nthat girls must be taught to sew.\r\n\r\nBoys should practice their hands upon the knife. John Bull used to laugh\r\nat Brother Jonathan for whittling, and Mr. Punch always drew the Yankee\r\nwith a blade in his fingers; but they found out long ago in Great\r\nBritain that whittling in this land led to something, a Boston notion,\r\na wooden clock, a yacht America, a labor-saving machine, a cargo of\r\nwooden-ware, a shop full of knick-knacks, an age of inventions. Boys\r\nneed not be kept back to the hand-craft of the knife. For in-doors there\r\nare the type case and printing press, the paint box, the tool box, the\r\nlathe; and for out doors, the trowel, the spade, the grafting knife. It\r\nmatters not how many of the minor arts the youth acquires. The more the\r\nmerrier. Let each one gain the most he can in all such ways; for arts\r\nlike these bring no harm in their train; quite otherwise, they lure good\r\nfortune to their company.\r\n\r\nPlay, as well as work, may bring out hand-craft. The gun, the bat, the\r\nrein, the rod, the oar, all manly sports, are good training for the\r\nhand. Walking insures fresh air, but it does not train the body or mind\r\nlike games and sports which are played out of doors. A man of great fame\r\nas an explorer and as a student of nature (he who discovered, in the\r\nWest, bones of horses with two, three, and four toes, and who found the\r\nremains of birds with teeth) once told me that his success was largely\r\ndue to the sports of his youth. His boyish love of fishing gave him his\r\nmanly skill in exploration.\r\n\r\nI speak as if hand-craft was to be learned by sport. So it may. It may\r\nalso be learned by labor. Day by day for weeks I have been watching from\r\nmy study window a stately inn rise from the cellar just across the road.\r\nA bricklayer has been there employed whose touch is like the stroke of\r\nan artist. He handled each brick as if it were porcelain, balanced it\r\ncarefully in his hand, measured with his eye just the amount of mortar\r\nwhich it needed, and dropped the block into its bed, without staining\r\nits edge, without varying from the plumb line, by a stroke of hand-craft\r\nas true as the sculptor's. Toil gave him skill.\r\n\r\nThe second point I make is this: If you really value hand-craft,\r\nbuy that which shows hand-craft, encourage those who are engaged in\r\nhand-craft, help on with your voice and with your pocket, those who\r\nbring taste and skill and art into the works of their hand. If your\r\nmeans are so small that you only buy what you need for your daily wants,\r\nyou cannot have much choice, you must buy that which is cheapest; but\r\nhardly any one within the sound of my voice is so restricted as that;\r\nalmost if not quite every one buys something every year for his\r\npleasure, a curtain, a rug, a wall paper, a chair, or a table not\r\ncertainly needed, a vase, a clock, a, mantel ornament, a piece of\r\njewelry, a portrait, an etching, a picture. Now whenever you make such a\r\npurchase, to please your taste, to make your parlor or your chamber more\r\nattractive, choose that which shows good handiwork. Such a choice will\r\nlast. You will not tire of it as you will of that which has but a\r\ncommonplace form or pattern.\r\n\r\nI come now to a third point. That which has just been said applies\r\nchiefly to things whose price is fixed by beauty. But handicraft gives\r\nus many works not pleasing to the eye, yet of the highest skill--a\r\nJacquard loom, a Corliss engine, a Hoe printing press, a Winchester\r\nrifle, an Edison dynamo, a Bell telephone. Ruskin may scout the work of\r\nmachinery, and up to a certain point may take us with him. Let us\r\nallow that works of art marked by the artist's own touch--the gates of\r\nParadise by Ghiberti, a shield by Cellini, a statue by Michael Angelo,\r\nare better than all reproductions and imitations, better than plaster\r\ncasts by Eichler, electrotypes by Barbedienne, or chromos by Prang. But\r\neven Ruskin cannot suppress the fact that machinery brings to every\r\nthrifty cottage in New England comforts and adornments which, in the\r\ndays of Queen Bess, were not known outside of the palace. Be mindful,\r\nthen, that handicraft makes machines which are wonders of productive\r\nforce--weaving tissues such as Penelope never saw, of woolen, cotton,\r\nlinen, and silk, to carpet our floors, cover our tables, cushion our\r\nchairs, and clothe our bodies; machines of which Vulcan never dreamed,\r\nto point a needle, bore a rifle, cut a watch wheel, or rule a series\r\nof lines, measuring forty thousand to an inch, with sureness which the\r\nunaided hand can never equal. Machinery is a triumph of handicraft as\r\ntruly as sculpture and architecture. The fingers which can plan and\r\nbuild a steamship or a suspension bridge, which can make the Quinebaug\r\nand the Blackstone turn spindles by the hundred thousand, which can turn\r\na rag heap into spotless paper, and make myriads of useful and artful\r\narticles from rough metal, are fingers which this age alone has evolved.\r\nThe craft which makes useful things cheap can make cheap things\r\nbeautiful. The Japanese will teach us how to form and finish, if we do\r\nnot first teach them how to slight and sham.\r\n\r\nA fourth point is this. If hand-craft is of such worth, boys and girls\r\nmust be trained in it. This, I am well aware is no new thought. Forty\r\nyears ago schools of applied science were added to Harvard and Yale\r\ncolleges; twenty years ago Congress gave enough land-scrip to aid in\r\nfounding at least one such school in every state; men of wealth, like\r\nmany whom you have known and whom you honor, have given large sums for\r\nlike ends. Now the people at large are waking up. They see their needs;\r\nthey have the means to supply what they want. Is there the will? Know\r\nthey the way? Far and near the cry is heard for a different training\r\nfrom that now given in the public schools. Many are trying to find it.\r\nAlmost every large town has its experiment--and many smaller places have\r\ntheirs. Nobody seems to know just what is best. Even the words which\r\nexpress the want are vague. Bright and thoughtful people differ as to\r\nwhat might, can, and should be done. A society has been formed in New\r\nYork to bring together the needed data. The Slater trustees, charged\r\nwith the care of a large fund for the training of freedmen, have said\r\nthat manual training must be given in all the schools they aid. The\r\ntown of Toledo in Ohio opened, some time since, a school of practical\r\ntraining for boys, which worked so well that another has lately been\r\nopened for girls. St. Louis is doing famously. Philadelphia has several\r\nexperiments in progress. Baltimore has made a start. In New York there\r\nare many noteworthy movements--half a dozen at least full of life and\r\nhope. Boston was never behindhand in knowledge, and in the new education\r\nis very alert, the efforts of a single lady deserving praise of high\r\ndegree. These are but signs of the times.\r\n\r\nSome things may be set down as fixed; for example, most of those who\r\nhave thought on this theme will agree on the points I am about to name,\r\nthough they may or may not like the names which I venture to propose:\r\n\r\n1. Kindergarten work should be taught in the nurseries and infant\r\nschools of rich and poor.\r\n\r\n2. Drawing should be taught in schools of every grade, till the hand\r\nuses the pencil as readily as the pen.\r\n\r\n3. Every girl at school if not at home should learn to sew.\r\n\r\n4. Every boy should learn the use of tools, the gardener's or the\r\ncarpenter's, or both.\r\n\r\n5. Well planned exercises, fitted to strengthen the various bodily\r\norgans, arms, fingers, wrists, lungs, etc., are good. Driving, swimming,\r\nrowing, and other manly sports should be favored.\r\n\r\nWhat precedes is at the basis of good work.\r\n\r\nIn addition:\r\n\r\n6. With good teachers, quite young children may learn the minor\r\ndecorative arts, carving, leather stamping, brass beating and the like,\r\nas is shown in the Leland classes of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n7. In towns, boys who begin to earn a living when they enter their teens\r\nmay be taught in evening schools to practice the craft of carpentry,\r\nbricklaying, plastering, plumbing, gas fitting, etc., as is shown\r\nsuccessfully in the Auchmuty schools of New York. Trade schools they are\r\ncalled; schools of practice for workmen would be a better name.\r\n\r\n8. Boys who can carry their studies through the later teens may learn,\r\nwhile at the high school or technical school or college, to work in wood\r\nand metals with precision, as I have lately seen in the College of the\r\nCity of New York, at Cornell University, and elsewhere-colleges or high\r\nschools with work-shops and practice classes. If they can take the\r\ntime to fit themselves to be foremen and leaders in machine shops and\r\nfactories, they may be trained in theoretical and practical mechanics,\r\nas in the Worcester Industrial Institute and in a score of other places;\r\nbut the youth must have talent as well as time to win the race in these\r\nhard paths. These are schools for foremen, or, if we may use a foreign\r\nword like Kindergarten, they are Meisterschaft schools.\r\n\r\n9. Youths who wish to enter the highest departments of engineering must\r\nfollow advanced courses of mathematics and physics, and must learn\r\nto apply this knowledge. The better colleges and universities afford\r\nabundant opportunities for such training, but their scientific\r\nlaboratories are fitted only for those who love long study as well as\r\nhard. These are schools for engineers.\r\n\r\n10. Girls are most likely to excel in the lighter arts--to design (for\r\nfurniture or fabrics), to embroider, to carve, to engrave, to etch, to\r\nmodel, to paint. Here also success depends largely upon that which was\r\ninborn, though girls of moderate talent in art, by patience, may become\r\nskilled in many kinds of art work. Schools for this instruction are\r\nschools of art (elementary, decorative, professional, etc.).\r\n\r\nIf there be those in this hall who think that hand-craft is adverse to\r\nrede-craft, let me ask them to study the lives of men of mark. Isaac\r\nNewton began his life as a farm-boy who carried truck to a market town;\r\nSpinoza, the philosopher of Amsterdam, ground lenses for his livelihood;\r\nWatt, the inventor of the steam engine, was mechanic to the University\r\nof Glasgow; Porson, the great professor of Greek, was trained as a\r\nweaver; George Washington was a land surveyor; Benjamin Franklin a\r\nprinter.\r\n\r\nBefore I close let me draw a lesson from the history of our land. Some\r\nof you doubtless bear in mind that before the late war men used to say,\r\n\"Cotton is king;\" and why so? Because the trades which hung on this crop\r\nwere so many and so strong that they ruled all others. The rise or fall\r\nof a penny in the price of cotton at Liverpool affected planters in\r\nthe South, spinners in the North, seamen on the ocean, bankers\r\nand money-changers everywhere. Now wheat and petroleum share the\r\nsovereignty; but then cotton was king. Who enthroned this harmless\r\nplant? Two masters of hand-craft, one of whom was born a few miles east\r\nof this place in Westborough; the other was a native of England who\r\nspent most of his days a few miles south of this city. Within five\r\nyears--not quite a century ago--these two men were putting in forms\r\nwhich could be seen, ideas which brought our countrymen large measures\r\nof both weal and woe. In 1790, Samuel Slater, once an apprentice to\r\nStrutt and Arkwright, built the mill at Pawtucket which taught Americans\r\nthe art of cotton-spinning; and before 1795, Eli Whitney had invented\r\nthe gin which easily cleansed the cotton boll of its seeds, and so made\r\nmarketable the great crop we have spoken of. Many men have made more\r\nnoise in the world than Slater and Whitney; few if any can be named\r\nwhose peaceable hand-craft has done so much to give this country its\r\nfront place in the markets of the globe.\r\n\r\nLet me come nearer home, and as I take my seat let me name a son of\r\nthis very town who loved hand-craft and rede-craft, and worthily aided\r\nboth--Isaiah Thomas, the patriot printer, editor, and publisher,\r\nhistorian of the printer's craft in this land, and founder of the far\r\nfamed antiquarian library, eldest in that group of institutions which\r\ngave to Worcester its rank in the world of letters, as its many products\r\ngive it standing in the world of industry and art.\r\n\r\nMindful of three such worthies, it is not strange that Salisbury,\r\nWashburn, Boylston, and many more have built up this high school of\r\nhandicraft; it will be no wonder if others like minded build on the\r\nfoundations which have been so fitly laid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING SEA WATER POTABLE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Read lately before the Manchester Literary and Philosophical\r\nSociety]\r\n\r\nBy THOMAS KAY, President of the Stockport Natural History Society.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author called attention to the absence of research in this\r\ndirection, and how man, endowed to overcome every physical disability\r\nwhich encompassed him on land, was powerless to live on the wide ocean,\r\nalthough it is teeming with life.\r\n\r\nThe water for experiment was taken from the English Channel, about\r\nfifty miles southwest of the Eddystone Lighthouse, and it was found\r\nto correspond closely with the analysis of the Atlantic published by\r\nRoscoe, viz.: Total solids 35.976, of which the total chlorides, are\r\n32.730, representing 19.868 of chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the Irish Sea and the English Channel nearer to the German\r\nOcean, from their neighborhood to great rivers, are weaker than the\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nSchweitzer's analysis of the waters of the English Channel, near\r\nBrighton, was taken as representing the composition of the sea, and is\r\nhere given:\r\n\r\n    Sodium chloride                27.059\r\n    Potassium   \"                   0.766\r\n    Magnesium   \"                   3.666\r\n        \"     bromide               0.029\r\n        \"     sulphate              2.296\r\n    Calcium     \"                   1.406\r\n        \"    carbonate              0.033\r\n    Iodine and ammoniacal salts    traces\r\n    Water                         964.795\r\n                                 ________\r\n                                 1000.000\r\n\r\nThe chlorides in the--\r\n\r\n    Irish Sea are about         30 per mille.\r\n    English Channel are about   31    \"\r\n    Beyond the Eddystone are    32    \"\r\n\r\nAs the requirement for a potable sea water does not arise except in\r\nmid-ocean, the proportion of 32 per mille must be taken as the basis of\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\nThis represents as near 20 per mille of chlorine as possible.\r\n\r\nFrom the analysis shown it will be perceived that the chlorides of\r\nsodium and magnesium are in great preponderance.\r\n\r\nIt is to the former of these that the baneful effects of sea water when\r\ndrunk are to be ascribed, for chloride of sodium or common salt produces\r\nthirst probably by its styptic action on the salivary glands, and scurvy\r\nby its deleterious action on the blood when taken in excess.\r\n\r\nSodium chloride being the principal noxious element in sea water, and\r\nsoda in combination with a vegetable or organic acid, such as citric\r\nacid, tartaric acid, or malic acid, being innocuous, the conclusion is\r\nthat the element of evil to be avoided is _chlorine_.\r\n\r\nAfter describing various experiments, and calling attention to the power\r\nof earthy matters in abstracting salts from solutions by which he hoped\r\nthe process would be perfected, an imperial pint of water from beyond\r\nthe Eddystone was shown mixed with 960 grains of citrate of silver and 4\r\ngrains of the free citric acid.\r\n\r\nEach part of the chlorides requires three parts by weight of the silver\r\ncitrate to throw down the chlorine, thus:\r\n\r\n3NaCl + Ag_{3}C_{6}H_{5}O_{7} = Na3.C_{6}H_{5}O_{7}+3AgCl.\r\n\r\nThe silver chloride formed a dense insoluble precipitate, and the\r\nsupernatant fluid was decanted and filtered through a rubber tube and\r\nhanded round as a beverage.\r\n\r\nIt contained in each fluid ounce by calculation about:\r\n\r\n    18       grains of citrate of soda.\r\n     1-1/2       \"        \"      magnesia.\r\n       1/2       \"        \"      potash.\r\n     1           \"    sulphate of magnesia.\r\n       1/2       \"        \"      lime.\r\n       1/5       \"    citric acid.\r\n\r\nwith less than half a grain of undecomposed chlorides.\r\n\r\nTo analyze this liquid therapeutically, it may be broadly stated that\r\nsalts of potash are _diuretic_, salts of magnesia _aperient_, and salts\r\nof soda _neutral_, except in excessive doses, or in combination with\r\nacids of varying medicinal action; thus, soda in nitric acid, nitrate\r\nof soda, is a _diuretic_, following the law of nitrates as nitrate of\r\npotash, a most powerful diuretic, nitrous ether, etc.; while soda in\r\ncombination with sulphuric acid as sulphate of soda is _aperient_,\r\nfollowing the law of sulphates, which increase aperient action, as in\r\nsulphate of magnesia, etc.\r\n\r\nThus it would seem that soda holds the scales evenly between potash and\r\nmagnesia in this medical sense, and that it is weighed, so to speak, on\r\neither side by the kind of mineral acid with which it may be combined.\r\n\r\nWith non-poisonous vegetable acids, and these slightly in excess, there\r\nis not such an effect produced.\r\n\r\nSodium is an important constituent of the human body, and citric acid,\r\nfrom its carbon, almost a food. Although no one would advocate saline\r\ndrinks in excess, yet, under especial circumstances, the solution of it\r\nin the form of citrate can hardly be hurtful when used to moisten the\r\nthroat and tongue, for it will never be used under circumstances where\r\nit can be taken in large quantities.\r\n\r\nIn the converted sea water the bulk of the solids is composed of inert\r\ncitrate of soda. There is a little citrate of potash, which is a feeble\r\ndiuretic; a little citrate and sulphate of magnesia, a slight aperient,\r\ncorrected, however, by the constipatory half grain of sulphate of lime;\r\nso that the whole practically is inoperative.\r\n\r\nThe combination of these salts in nature's proportions would seem to\r\nindicate that they must be the best for administration in those ailments\r\nto which their use would be beneficial.\r\n\r\nCitrate of silver is an almost insoluble salt, and requires to be\r\nkept from the light, air, and organic matter, it being very easily\r\ndecomposed.\r\n\r\nA stoppered bottle covered with India-rubber was exhibited as indicating\r\na suitable preserver of the salt, as it affords protection against\r\nlight, air, and breakage. As one ounce of silver citrate will convert\r\nhalf a pint of sea water into a drinkable fluid, and a man can keep\r\nalive upon it a day, then seven ounces of it will keep him a week, and\r\nso on, it may not unreasonably be hoped, in proportion.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to pack the silver citrate in hermetically sealed rubber\r\ncovered bottles or tubes, to be inserted under the canisters or thwarts\r\nof the life-boats in ocean-going vessels, and this can be done at a\r\nsimple interest on the first outlay, without any loss by depreciation,\r\nas it will always be worth its cost, and be invaluable in case of need.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACIDS OF WOOL OIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll wools contain a certain amount of animal oil or grease, which\r\npermeates every portion of the fleece. The proportion of oil varies with\r\nthe breed of sheep. A difference in climate and soil materially affects\r\nthe yield of oil. This is shown by analyses made of different kinds of\r\nwool, both foreign and domestic. Spanish wool was found to have but\r\neight per cent. grease; Australian wool fifteen per cent.; while in some\r\nfleeces of Pennsylvania wool as high as forty per cent. was obtained. To\r\nextract the oil from the wool, a fleece was put in a tall cylinder and\r\nnaphtha poured on it. The naphtha on being allowed to drain through\r\nslowly dissolved out the grease. This naphtha solution was distilled;\r\nthe naphtha passing off while grease remained--a dark oil having high\r\nspecific gravity and remaining nearly solid at the ordinary temperature.\r\nI am indebted to Mrs. Richards for this method of extracting the oil.\r\nThe process is quick and inexpensive, and is applicable to the treatment\r\nof large quantities of wool.\r\n\r\nThe object of these experiments was to find the readiest method of\r\nseparating wool oil into its bases and acids, and further to identify\r\nthe various fatty acids. A solution of the oil in naphtha was cooled to\r\n15° C. This caused a separation of the oil into two portions: a white\r\nsolid fat and a fluid dark oil. The first on examination proved to be a\r\nmixture of palmitic and stearic acids existing uncombined in the wool\r\noil. The original wool oil was saponified by boiling with alcoholic\r\npotash.\r\n\r\nThe soap formed was separated into two portions by shaking with ether\r\nand water. On standing, the solution separated into two layers, the\r\nupper or murial solution containing the bases, the lower or aqueous\r\nsolution containing the acids. This method of separation is very slow.\r\nIn one case it worked very well, but as a rule appeared to be almost\r\nimpracticable. Benzol and naphtha were tried, instead of ether, but the\r\nresults were less satisfactory. On suggestion of Prof. Ordway, potassium\r\nchloride was added to the soap solution partially separated by ether and\r\nwater. This caused an immediate and complete separation. By the use of\r\npotassium chloride it was found possible to effect a separation with\r\nbenzol and water, also with naphtha and water.\r\n\r\nAnother means of separation was tried by precipitating the calcium\r\nsalts, from a solution of the potash soap. From the portion of the\r\ncalcium salts insoluble in alcohol, a fatty acid was obtained with a\r\nmelting point and composition almost identical with the melting point\r\nand composition of palmitic acid. The aqueous portion of the separation\r\neffected by water and ether was examined for the fatty acid. The lead\r\nsalts of the fatty acids were digested with ether, which dissolved out\r\nthe lead oleate. From this oleic acid was obtained. This was further\r\npurified by forming the Boreum salt of oleic acid. The lead salts not\r\nsoluble in ether were decomposed by acid. The fatty acids set free were\r\nsaponified by carbonate of potassium. A fractional precipitation was\r\neffected by adding lead acetate in successive portions; each portion\r\nsufficient to precipitate one-fourth of all the acids present.\r\n\r\nThe acid obtained from the first fractionation had the melting point at\r\n75°-76°, indicating an acid either in carbon then stearic or palmitic\r\nacids.\r\n\r\nThe acids obtained from the third fractionation had a melting point of\r\n53°-54° C. This acid in composition and general properties was very\r\nsimilar to that obtained by freezing the naphtha solution of the oil,\r\nand is probably a mixture of stearic and palmitic acids. These acids,\r\nbeing in combination with the bases of the oil, would be set free only\r\non saponifying the oil and subsequently decomposing with acid.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I should say that but a small proportion of the fatty\r\nacids exist in the wool oil uncombined; that the proportion of oleic\r\nacid is small, and can only be obtained in an oxidized condition; that\r\nthe main portion of the fatty acids is composed of stearic and palmitic\r\nacids in nearly equal proportions; that the existence of a fatty acid,\r\ncontaining a higher per cent. of carbon than those mentioned, is not\r\nfully established.--_N.W. Shedd, M.I.T._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW ABSORBENT FOR OXYGEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTTO, BARON V.D. PFORDTEN.--The author makes use of a solution of\r\nchromous chloride, which he prepares as follows:\r\n\r\nHe first heats chromic acid with concentrated hydrochloric acid, so\r\nas to obtain a strong green solution of chromic chloride free from\r\nchlorine. This is then reduced with zinc and hydrochloric acid. The blue\r\nchromous chloride solution thus obtained is poured into a saturated\r\nsolution of sodium acetate in an atmosphere of carbonic acid. A\r\nred precipitate of chromous acetate is formed, which is washed by\r\ndecantation in water containing carbonic acid. This salt is relatively\r\nstable, and can be preserved for an indefinite time in a moist condition\r\nin stoppered bottles filled with carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nIn this process the following precautions are to be observed:\r\n\r\nSpongy flocks always separate from the zinc used in the reduction, which\r\nfloat about in the acid liquid for a long time and give off minute gas\r\nbubbles. If poured into the solution of sodium acetate, they would\r\ncontaminate the precipitate; and when dissolved in hydrochloric acid,\r\nwould occasion a slight escape of hydrogen. The solution of chromous\r\nchloride must therefore be freed from the zinc by filtration in the\r\nabsence of air. For this purpose the reduction is carried on in a flask\r\nfitted up like a washing bottle. The long tube is bent down outside the\r\nflask, and is here provided with a small bulb tube containing glass wool\r\nor asbestos. The hydrogen gas liberated during reduction is at first let\r\nescape through this tube; afterward its outer end is closed, and it is\r\npressed down into the liquid. The hydrogen must now pass through the\r\nshorter tube (the mouthpiece of the washing bottle), which has an India\r\nrubber valve. When the reduction is complete, the blue liquid is driven\r\nup in the long tube by introducing carbonic acid through the short tube,\r\nso that it filters through the asbestos into the solution of sodium\r\nacetate into which the reopened end of the long tube dips. When washing\r\nout the red precipitate, at first a little acetic acid is added to\r\ndissolve any basic zinc carbonate which has been deposited. In this\r\nmanner a chromous acetate is obtained perfectly free from zinc.\r\n\r\nFor the absorption of oxygen the compound just described is decomposed\r\nwith hydrochloric acid in the following simple washing apparatus: Upon\r\na shelf there are fixed side by side two ordinary preparation glasses,\r\nclosed with caoutchouc stoppers, each having three perforations. Each\r\ntwo apertures receive the glass tubes used in gas washing bottles, while\r\nthe third holds a dropping funnel. It is filled with dilute hydrochloric\r\nacid, and after the expulsion of the air by a current of gas, plentiful\r\nquantities of chromous acetate are passed into the bottles. When the\r\ncurrent of gas has been passed in for some time, the hydrochloric acid\r\nis let enter, which dissolves the chromous acetate, and thus, in the\r\nabsence of air, produces a solution of blue chromous chloride. It is\r\nadvisable to use an excess of chromous acetate or an insufficient\r\nquantity of hydrochloric acid, so that there may be no free hydrochloric\r\nacid in the liquid. To keep back any free acetic acid which might be\r\nswept over by the current of gas, there is introduced after the washing\r\napparatus another washing bottle with sodium carbonate. Also solid\r\npotassium carbonate may be used instead of calcium chloride for drying\r\nthe gas. If the two apertures of the washing apparatus are fitted with\r\nsmall pinch cocks, it is ready for use, and merely requires to be\r\nconnected with the gas apparatus in action in order to free the gas\r\ngenerated from oxygen. As but little chromous salt is decomposed by the\r\noxygen such a washing apparatus may serve for many experiments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGAIFFE'S NEW MEDICAL GALVANOMETER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this apparatus, which contains but one needle, and has no directing\r\nmagnet, proportionability between the intensities and deflections is\r\nobtained by means of a special form given the frame upon which the wire\r\nis wound.\r\n\r\nWe give herewith a figure of the curve that Mr. Gaiffe has fixed upon\r\nafter numerous experiments. Upon examination it will be seen that the\r\nneedle approaches the current in measure as the directing action of\r\nthe earth increases; and experiment proves that the two actions\r\ncounterbalance each other, and render the deflections very sensibly\r\nproportional to the intensities up to an angle of from 65 to 75 degrees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnother important fact has likewise been ascertained, and that is that,\r\nunder such circumstances, the magnetic intensity of the needle may\r\nchange without the indications ceasing to have the same exactness up to\r\n65 degrees. As well known, Mr. Desains has demonstrated that this occurs\r\nlikewise in sinus or tangent galvanometers; but these have helices that\r\nare very large in proportion to the needle. In medical galvanometers the\r\nproportions are no longer the same, and the needle is always very near\r\nthe directing helix. If this latter is square, or even elliptical, it is\r\nfound that, beyond an angle of 15 degrees, there are differences of 4 or\r\n5 degrees in the indications given with the same intensity of current by\r\nthe same needle, according to the latter's intensity of magnetism. This\r\ninconvenience is quite grave, for it often happens that a needle changes\r\nmagnetic intensity, either under the influence of too strong currents\r\nsent into the apparatus, or of other magnets in its vicinity, or as\r\na consequence of the bad quality of the steel, etc. It was therefore\r\nurgently required that this should be remedied, and from this point\r\nof view the new mode of winding the wire is an important improvement\r\nintroduced into medical galvanometers.--_La Lumiere Electrique_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUSPENSION OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that life exists in a latent state in the seeds of\r\nplants, and may be preserved therein, so to speak, indefinitely. In\r\n1853, Ridolfi deposited in the Egyptian Museum of Florence a sheaf of\r\nwheat that he had obtained from seeds found in a mummy case dating back\r\nabout 3,000 years. This aptitude of revivification is found to a high\r\ndegree in animalcules of low order. The air which we breathe is loaded\r\nwith impalpable dust that awaits, for ages perhaps, proper conditions\r\nof heat and moisture to give it an ephemeral life that it will lose and\r\nacquire by turns.\r\n\r\nIn 1707, Spallanzani found it possible, eleven times in succession, to\r\nsuspend the life of rotifers submitted to desiccation, and to call it\r\nback again by moistening this organic dust with water. A few years\r\nago Doyere brought to life some tardigrades that had been dried at a\r\ntemperature of 150° and kept four weeks in a vacuum. If we ascend the\r\nscale of beings, we find analogous phenomena produced by diverse causes.\r\nFlies that have been imported in casks of Madeira have been resuscitated\r\nin Europe, and chrysalids have been kept in this state for years.\r\nCockchafers drowned, and then dried in the sun, have been revived after\r\na lapse of twenty-four hours, two days, and even five days, after\r\nsubmersion. Frogs, salamanders, and spiders poisoned by curare or\r\nnicotine, have returned to life after several days of apparent death.\r\n\r\nCold produces some extraordinary effects. Spallanzani kept several frogs\r\nin the center of a lump of ice for two years, and, although they became\r\ndry, rigid, almost friable, and gave no external appearance of being\r\nalive, it was only necessary to expose them to a gradual and moderate\r\nheat to put an end to the lethargic state in which they lay.\r\n\r\nPikes and salamanders have at different epochs been revived before the\r\neyes of Maupertuis and Constant Dumeril (members of the Academy of\r\nSciences) after being frozen stiff. Auguste Dumeril, son of Constant,\r\nand who was the reporter of the committee relative to the Blois toad in\r\n1851, published a curious memoir the following year in which he narrates\r\nhow he interrupted life through congelation of the liquids and solids of\r\nthe organism. Some frogs, whose internal temperature had been reduced to\r\n-2° in an atmosphere of -12°, returned to life before his eyes, and he\r\nobserved their tissues regain their usual elasticity and their heart\r\npass from absolute immobility to its normal motion.\r\n\r\nThere is therefore no reason for doubting the assertions of travelers\r\nwho tell us that the inhabitants of North America and Russia transport\r\nfish that are frozen stiff, and bring them to life again by dipping them\r\ninto water of ordinary temperature ten or fifteen days afterward. But I\r\nthink too much reliance should not be put in the process devised by\r\nthe great English physiologist, Hunter, for prolonging the life of man\r\nindefinitely by successive freezings. It has been allowed to no one but\r\na romancer, Mr. Edmond About, to be present at this curious operation.\r\n\r\nAmong the mammifera we find appearances of death in their winter sleep;\r\nbut these are incomplete, since the temperature of hibernating animals\r\nremains greater by one degree than that of the surrounding air, and the\r\nmotions of the heart and respiration are simply retarded. Dr. Preyer has\r\nobserved that a hamster sometimes goes five minutes without breathing\r\nappreciably after a fortnight's sleep.\r\n\r\nIn man himself a suspension of life, or at least phenomena that seem\r\ninseparable therefrom, has been observed many times. In the _Journal des\r\nSavants_ for 1741 we read that a Col. Russel, having witnessed the\r\ndeath of his wife, whom he tenderly loved, did not wish her buried, and\r\nthreatened to kill any one who should attempt to remove the body before\r\nhe witnessed its decomposition himself. Eight days passed by without the\r\nwoman giving the slightest sign of life, \"when, at a moment when he was\r\nholding her hand and shedding tears over her, the church bell began to\r\nring, and, to his indescribable surprise, his wife sat up and said, 'It\r\nis the last stroke, we shall be too late.' She recovered.\"\r\n\r\nAt a session of the Academy of Sciences, Oct. 17, 1864, Mr. Blaudet\r\ncommunicated a report upon a young woman of thirty summers who, being\r\nsubject to nervous attacks, fell, after her crises, into a sort of\r\nlethargic sleep which lasted several weeks and sometimes several months.\r\nOne of her sleeps, especially, lasted from the beginning of the year\r\n1862 until March, 1863.\r\n\r\nDr. Paul Levasseur relates that, in a certain English family, lethargy\r\nseemed to have become hereditary. The first case was exhibited in an old\r\nlady who remained for fifteen days in an immovable and insensible state,\r\nand who afterward, on regaining her consciousness, lived for quite a\r\nlong time. Warned by this fact, the family preserved a young man for\r\nseveral weeks who appeared to be dead, but who came to life again.\r\n\r\nDr. Pfendler, in an inaugural thesis (Paris, 1833), minutely describes a\r\ncase of apparent death of which he himself was a witness. A young girl\r\nof Vienna at the age of 15 was attacked by a nervous affection that\r\nbrought on violent crises followed by lethargic states which lasted\r\nthree or four days. After a time she became so exhausted that the first\r\nphysicians of the city declared that there was no more hope. It was not\r\nlong, in fact, before she was observed to rise in her bed and fall back\r\nas if struck with death. \"For four hours she appeared to me,\" says Dr.\r\nPfendler, \"completely inanimate. With Messrs. Franck and Schaeffer,\r\nI made every possible effort to rekindle the spark of life. Neither\r\nmirror, nor burned feather, nor ammonia, nor pricking succeeded in\r\ngiving us a sign of sensibility. Galvanism was tried without the patient\r\nshowing any contractility. Mr. Franck believed her to be dead, but\r\nnevertheless advised me to leave her on the bed. For twenty-eight hours\r\nno change supervened, although it was thought that a little putrefaction\r\nwas observed. The death bell was sounded, the friends of the girl had\r\ndressed her in white and had crowned her with flowers, and all was\r\narranged for her burial. Desiring to convince myself of the course of\r\nthe putrefaction, I visited the body again, and found that no further\r\nadvance had been made than before. What was my astonishment when I\r\nbelieved that I saw a slight respiratory motion. I looked again, and saw\r\nthat I was not mistaken. I at once used friction and irritants, and in\r\nan hour and a half the respiration increased. The patient opened her\r\neyes, and, struck with the funereal paraphernalia around her, returned\r\nto consciousness, and said, 'I am too young to die.'\" All this was\r\nfollowed by a ten hours' sleep. Convalescence proceeded rapidly, and the\r\ngirl became free from all her nervous troubles. During her crisis she\r\nheard everything. She quoted some Latin words that Mr. Franck had used.\r\nHer most fearful agony had been to hear the preparations for her burial\r\nwithout being able to get rid of her torpor. Medical dictionaries are\r\nfull of anecdotes of this nature, but I shall cite but two more.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of November, 1812, during the fatal retreat from Russia,\r\nCommandant Tascher, desiring to bring back to France the body of his\r\ngeneral, who had been killed by a bullet, and who had been buried since\r\nthe day before, disinterred him, and, upon putting him into a landau,\r\nand noticing that he was still breathing, brought him to life again by\r\ndint of care. A long time afterward this same general was one of the\r\npall bearers at the funeral obsequies of the aide-de-camp who had buried\r\nhim. In 1826 a young priest returned to life at the moment the bishop\r\nof the diocese was pronouncing the _De Profundis_ over his body. Forty\r\nyears afterward, this priest, who had become Cardinal Donnett, preached\r\na feeling sermon upon the danger of premature burial.\r\n\r\nI trust I have now sufficiently prepared the mind of the reader for an\r\nexamination of the phenomena of the voluntary suspension of life that I\r\nshall now treat of.\r\n\r\nThe body of an animal may be compared to a machine that converts the\r\nfood that it receives into motion. It receives nothing, it will produce\r\nnothing; but there is no reason why it should get out of order if it is\r\nnot deteriorated by external agents. The legendary rustic who wanted to\r\naccustom his ass to go without food was therefore theoretically wrong\r\nonly because he at the same time wanted the animal to work. The whole\r\ndifficulty consists in breaking with old habits. To return to the\r\ncomparison that we just made, we shall run the risk of exploding the\r\nboiler of a steam engine if we heat it or cool it abruptly, but we can\r\nrun it very slowly and for a very long time with but very little fuel.\r\nWe may even preserve a little fire under the ashes, and this, although\r\nit may not be capable of setting the parts running, will suffice later\r\non to revivify the fireplace after it has been charged anew with fuel.\r\n\r\nWe have recently had the example of Dr. Tanner, who went forty days\r\nwithout any other nourishment than water. Not very long ago Liedovine de\r\nSchiedam, who had been bedridden for twenty years, affirmed that she\r\nhad taken no food for eight of them. It is said that Saint Catharine of\r\nSienna gradually accustomed herself to do without food, and that she\r\nlived twenty years in total abstinence. We know of several examples of\r\nprolonged sleep during which the sleeper naturally took no nourishment.\r\nIn his Magic Disquisitions, Delvis cites the case of a countryman who\r\nslept for an entire autumn and winter. Pfendler relates that a certain\r\nyoung and hysterical woman fell twice into a deep slumber which each\r\ntime lasted six months. In 1883 an _enceinte_ woman was found asleep\r\non a bench in the Grand Armee Avenue. She was taken to the Beaujon\r\nHospital, where she was delivered a few days after while still asleep,\r\nand it was not till the end of three months that she could be awakened\r\nfrom her lethargy. At this very moment, at Tremeille, a woman named\r\nMarguerite Bouyenvalle is sleeping a sleep that has lasted nearly a\r\nyear, during which the only food that she has had is a few drops of soup\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nWhat is more remarkable, Dr. Fournier says in his Dictionary of Medical\r\nSciences that he knew of a distinguished writer at Paris, who sometimes\r\nwent for months at a time without taking anything but emollient drinks,\r\nwhile at the same time living along like other people.\r\n\r\nRespiration is certainly more necessary to life than food is; but it is\r\nnot absolutely indispensable, as we have seen in the cases of apparent\r\ndeath cited in our previous article. It is possible, through exercise,\r\nfor a person to accustom himself, up to a certain point, to abstinence\r\nfrom air as he can from food. Those who dive for pearls, corals, or\r\nsponges succeed in remaining from two to three minutes under water. Miss\r\nLurline, who exhibited in Paris in 1882, remained two and a half minutes\r\nbeneath the water of her aquarium without breathing. In his treatise De\r\nla Nature, Henri de Rochas, physician to Louis XIII., gives six minutes\r\nas the maximum length of time that can elapse between successive\r\ninspirations of air. It is probable that this figure was based upon an\r\nobservation of hibernating animals.\r\n\r\nIn his Encyclopedic Dictionary, Dr. Dechambre relates the history of\r\na Hindoo who hid himself in the waters of the Ganges where women were\r\nbathing, seized one of them by the legs, drowned her, and then removed\r\nher jewels. Her disappearance was attributed to crocodiles. One woman\r\nwho succeeded in escaping him denounced the assassin, who was seized and\r\nhanged in 1817.\r\n\r\nA well known case, is that of Col. Townshend, who possessed the\r\nremarkable faculty of stopping at will not only his respiration, but\r\nalso the beating of his heart. He performed the experiment one day in\r\nthe presence of Surgeon Gosch, who cared for him in his old age, two\r\nphysicians, and his apothecary, Mr. Shrine. In their presence, says\r\nGosch, the Colonel lay upon his back, Dr. Cheyne watched his pulse, Dr.\r\nBaynard put his hand upon his heart, and Mr. Shrine held a mirror to\r\nhis mouth. After a few seconds no pulse, movement of the heart, or\r\nrespiration could be observed. At the end of half an hour, as the\r\nspectators were beginning to get frightened, they observed the functions\r\nprogressively resuming their course, and the Colonel came back to life.\r\n\r\nThe fakirs of India habituate themselves to abstinence from air, either\r\nby introducing into the nostrils strings that come out through the\r\nmouth, or by dwelling in subterranean cells that air and light never\r\nenter except through narrow crevices that are sometimes filled with\r\nclay. Here they remain seated in profound silence, for hours at a time,\r\nwithout any other motion than that of the fingers as the latter slowly\r\ntake beads from a chaplet, the mind absorbed by the mental pronunciation\r\nof OM (the holy triune name), which they must repeat incessantly while\r\nendeavoring to breathe as little as possible. They gradually lengthen\r\nthe intervals between their inspirations and expirations, until, in\r\nthree or four months, they succeed in making them an hour and a half.\r\nThis is not the ideal, for one of their sacred books says, in speaking\r\nof a saint: \"At the fourth month he no longer takes any food but air,\r\nand that only every twelve days, and, master of his respiration he\r\nembraces God in his thought. At the fifth he stands as still as a pole;\r\nhe no longer sees anything but Baghavat, and God touches his cheek to\r\nbring him out of his ecstasy.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be conceived that by submitting themselves to such gymnastics\r\nfrom infancy, certain men, already predisposed by atavism or a peculiar\r\nconformation, might succeed in doing things that would seem impossible\r\nto the common run of mortals. Do we not daily see acrobats remaining\r\nhead downward for a length of time that would suffice to kill 99 per\r\ncent, of their spectators through congestion if they were to place\r\nthemselves in the same posture? Can the savage who laboriously learns\r\nto spell, letter by letter, comprehend how many people get the general\r\nsense of an entire page at a single glance?\r\n\r\nThere is no reason, then, _a priori_, for assigning to the domain of\r\nlegerdemain the astonishing facts that are told us by a large number of\r\nwitnesses, worthy of credence, regarding a young fakir who, forty years\r\nago, was accustomed to allow himself to be buried, and resuscitated\r\nseveral months afterward.\r\n\r\nAn English officer, Mr. Osborne, gives the following account of one of\r\nthese operations, which took place in 1838 at the camp of King Randjet\r\nSingh:\r\n\r\n\"After a few preparations, which lasted some days, and that it would\r\nprove repugnant to enumerate, the fakir declared himself ready to\r\nundergo the ordeal. The Maharajah, the Sikhs chiefs, and Gen. Ventura,\r\nassembled near a masonry tomb that had been constructed expressly to\r\nreceive him. Before their eyes, the fakir closed with wax all the\r\napertures in his body (except his mouth) that could give entrance\r\nto air. Then, having taken off the clothing that he had on, he was\r\nenveloped in a canvas sack, and, according to his wish, his tongue was\r\nturned back in such a way as to close the entrance to his windpipe.\r\nImmediately after this he fell into a sort of trance. The bag that held\r\nhim was closed and a seal was put upon it by the Maharajah. The bag was\r\nthen put into a wooden box, which was fastened by a padlock, sealed, and\r\nlet down into the tomb. A large quantity of earth was thrown into the\r\nhole and rammed down, and then barley was sown on the surface and\r\nsentinels placed around with orders to watch day and night.\r\n\r\n\"Despite all such precautions, the Maharajah had his doubts; so he came\r\ntwice in the space of ten months (the time during which the fakir was\r\nburied), and had the tomb opened in his presence. The fakir was in the\r\nbag into which he had been put, cold and inanimate. The ten months\r\nhaving expired, he was disinterred, Gen. Ventura and Capt. Ward saw the\r\npadlock removed, the seals broken, and the box taken from the tomb.\r\nThe fakir was taken out, and no pulsation either at the heart or pulse\r\nindicated the presence of life. As a first measure for reviving him, a\r\nperson introduced a finger gently into his mouth and placed his tongue\r\nin its natural position. The top of his head was the only place where\r\nthere was any perceptible heat. By slowly pouring warm water over his\r\nbody, signs of life were gradually obtained, and after about two hours\r\nof care the patient got up and began to walk.\r\n\r\n\"This truly extraordinary man says that during his burial he has\r\ndelightful dreams, but that the moment of awakening is always very\r\npainful to him. Before returning to a consciousness of his existence he\r\nexperiences vertigoes. His nails and hair cease to grow. His only fear\r\nis that he may be harmed by worms and insects, and it is to protect\r\nhimself from these that he has the box suspended in the center of the\r\ntomb.\"\r\n\r\nThis sketch was published in the _Magasin Pittoresque_ in 1842 by a\r\nwriter who had just seen Gen. Ventura in Paris, and had obtained from\r\nhim a complete confirmation of the story told by Capt. Wade.\r\n\r\nAnother English officer, Mr. Boileau, in a work published in 1840,\r\nand Dr. MacGregor, in his medical topography of Lodhiana, narrate two\r\nanalogous exhumations that they separately witnessed. The question\r\ntherefore merits serious examination.--_A. de Rochas, in La Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome experiments recently made by M. Olszewsky appear to show that\r\nliquid oxygen is one of the best of refrigerants. He found that when\r\nliquefied oxygen was allowed to vaporize under the pressure of one\r\natmosphere, a temperature as low as -181.4° C. was produced. The\r\ntemperature fell still further when the pressure on the liquid oxygen\r\nwas reduced to nine millimeters of mercury. Though the pressure was\r\nreduced still further to four millimeters of mercury, yet the oxygen\r\nremained liquid. Liquefied nitrogen, when allowed to evaporate under a\r\npressure of sixty millimeters of mercury, gave a temperature of -214°\r\nC., only the surface of the liquid gas became opaque from incipient\r\nsolidification. Under lower pressures the nitrogen solidified,\r\nand temperatures as low as -225° C. were recorded by the hydrogen\r\nthermometer. The lowest temperature obtained by allowing liquefied\r\ncarbonic oxide to vaporize was -220.5° C.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVALLARIA.\r\n\r\nBy OTTO A. WALL, M.D., Ph.G.\r\n\r\n\r\nCnovallaria Majalis is a stemless perennial plant, found in both\r\nthe eastern and western hemispheres, with two elliptic leaves and a\r\none-sided raceme bearing eight or ten bell-shaped flowers. The flowers\r\nare fragrant, and perfumes called \"Lily of the Valley\" are among the\r\npopular odors.\r\n\r\nBoth leaves and flowers have been used in medicine, but the rhizome is\r\nthe part most frequently used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONVALLARIA.]\r\n\r\nThe fresh rhizome is a creeping, branching rhizome of a pale yellowish\r\nwhite color, which, on drying, darkens to a straw color, or even a\r\nbrown in places. When dry it is about the thickness of a thick knitting\r\nneedle, swelling to the thickness of a quill when soaked in water. It\r\nis of uniform thickness, except near the leaf-bearing ends, which are\r\nthicker marked with numerous leafscars, or bare buds covered with\r\nscales, and often having attached the tattered remains of former leaves.\r\nFig. A shows a portion of rhizome, natural size, and Fig. B shows\r\nanother piece enlarged to double linear size.\r\n\r\nThe internodes are smooth, the rootlets being attached at the nodes. The\r\nrootlets are filiform, and darker in color.\r\n\r\nThe rhizome is covered by an epidermis, composed of muriform cells of a\r\nbright yellow color, after having been treated with liquor potassæ to\r\nclear up the tissues. These cells are shown in Fig. G. An examination of\r\nthe transverse section shows us the endogenous structure, as we find\r\nit also in various other drugs (sarsaparilla, etc.), namely, a nucleus\r\nsheath, inclosing the fibrovascular bundles and pith, and surrounded\r\nby a peri-ligneous or peri-nuclear portion, consisting of soft-walled\r\nparenchyma cells, loosely arranged with many small, irregularly\r\ntriangular, intercellular spaces in the tranverse section. Some of these\r\ncells contain bundles of raphides (Fig. 2), one of which bundles is\r\nshown crushed in Fig. J. Sometimes these crystals are coarser and less\r\nneedle-like, as in Fig. K. Fig. C shows a transverse section through the\r\nleaf-bearing portion of the rhizome (at a), and is rather irregular on\r\naccount of the fibrovascular bundles diverging into the base of the\r\nleaves of flower-stalks. A more regular appearance is seen in Fig. D,\r\nwhich is a section through the internode (b). In it we see the nuclear\r\nsheath, varying in width from one to three cells, and inclosing a number\r\nof crescent-shaped fibrovascular bundles, with their convexities toward\r\nthe center and their horns toward the nuclear sheath. There are also\r\nfrom two to four or five free closed fibrovascular bundles in the\r\ncentral pith.\r\n\r\nThese fibrovascular bundles consist mainly of dotted or reticulated\r\nducts (Fig. F), but all gradations from, this to the spiroids, or even\r\ntrue spiral ducts (Fig. E). may be found, though the annular and spiral\r\nducts are quite rare. These ducts are often prismatically compressed\r\nby each other. The fibrovascular bundles also contain soft-walled\r\nprosenchyma cells. The peri-nuclear portion consists of soft-walled\r\nparenchyma, smaller near the nuclear sheath and the epidermis, and\r\nlarger about midway between, and of the same character as the cells of\r\nthe pith. In longitudinal section they appear rectangular, similar to\r\nthe walls of the epidermis (G), but with thinner walls.\r\n\r\nAll parts of the plant have been used in medicine, either separately or\r\ntogether, and according to some authorities the whole flowering plant is\r\nthe best form in which to use this drug.\r\n\r\nThe active principles are _convallaramin_ and _convallarin_.\r\n\r\nIt is considered to act similarly to digitalis as a heart-stimulant,\r\nespecially when the failure of the heart's action is due to mechanical\r\nimpediments rather than to organic degeneration. It is best given in the\r\nform of fluid extract in the dose of 1 to 5 cubic centimeters (15 to\r\n75 minims), commencing with the smaller doses, and increasing, if\r\nnecessary, according to the effects produced in each individual\r\ncase.--_The Pharmacist_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLIGHT OF THE BUZZARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring my visit to the Southern States of America, I have had several\r\nopportunities of watching, under favorable conditions, the flight of the\r\nbuzzard, the scavenger of Southern cities. Although in most respect this\r\nbird's manner of flight resembles that of the various sea-birds which I\r\nhave often watched for hours sailing steadily after ocean steamships,\r\nyet, being a land bird, the buzzard is more apt to give examples of that\r\nkind of flight in which a bird remains long over the same place. Instead\r\nof sailing steadily on upon outstretched pinions, the buzzard often\r\nascends in a series of spirals, or descends along a similar course. I\r\nhave not been able to time the continuance of the longest flights during\r\nwhich the wings have not once been flapped, for the simple reason that,\r\nin every case where I have attempted to do so, the bird has passed out\r\nof view either by upward or horizontal traveling. But I am satisfied\r\nthat in many cases the bird sweeps onward or about on unflapping wings\r\nfor more than half an hour.\r\n\r\nNow, many treat this problem of aerial flotation as if it were of the\r\nnature of a miracle--something not to be explained. Explanations which\r\nhave been advanced have, it is true, been in many cases altogether\r\nuntenable. For instance, some have asserted that the albatross, the\r\ncondor, and other birds which float for a long time without moving\r\ntheir wings--and that, too, in some cases, at great heights above the\r\nsea-level, where the air is very thin--are supported by some gas within\r\nthe hollow parts of their bones, as the balloon is supported by the\r\nhydrogen within it. The answer to this is that a balloon is _not_\r\nsupported by the hydrogen within it, but by the surrounding air, and in\r\njust such degree as the air is displaced by the lighter gas. The air\r\naround a bird is only displaced by the bird's volume, and the pressure\r\nof the air corresponding to this displacement is not equivalent to more\r\nthan one five-hundredth part of the bird's weight. Another idea is that\r\nwhen a bird seems to be floating on unmoving wings there is really a\r\nrapid fluttering of the feathers of the wings, by which a sustaining\r\npower is obtained. But no one who knows anything of the anatomy of\r\nthe bird will adopt this idea for an instant, and no one who has ever\r\nwatched with a good field-glass a floating bird of the albatross or\r\nbuzzard kind will suppose they are fluttering their feathers in this\r\nway, even though he should be utterly ignorant of the anatomy of the\r\nwings. Moreover, any one acquainted with the laws of dynamics will know\r\nthat there would be tremendous loss of power in the fluttering movement\r\nimagined as compared with the effect of sweeping downward and backward\r\nthe whole of each wing.\r\n\r\nThere is only one possible way of explaining the floating power of\r\nbirds, and that is by associating it with the rapid motion acquired\r\noriginally by wing flapping, and afterward husbanded, so to speak, by\r\nabsolutely perfect adjustment and balancing. To this the answer is often\r\nadvanced that it implies ignorance of the laws of dynamics to suppose\r\nthat rapid advance can affect the rate of falling, as is implied by the\r\ntheory that it enables the bird to float.\r\n\r\nNow, as a matter of fact, a slight slope of the wings would undoubtedly\r\nproduce a raising power, and so an answer is at one obtained to this\r\nobjection. But I venture to assert, with the utmost confidence, that a\r\nperfectly horizontal plane, advancing swiftly in a horizontal direction\r\nat first, will not sink as quickly, or anything like as quickly, as a\r\nsimilar plane let fall from a position of rest. A cannon-ball, rushing\r\nhorizontally from the mouth of a cannon, begins to fall just as if it\r\nwere simply dropped. But the case of a horizontal plane is altogether\r\ndifferent. If rapidly advancing, it passes continually over still air;\r\nif simply let fall, the air beneath it yields, and presently currents\r\nare set up which facilitate the descent of the flat body; but there is\r\nno time to set up these aerial movements as the flat body passes rapidly\r\nover still air.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, we know that this difference exists, from\r\nthe difference in the observed behavior of a flat card set flying\r\nhorizontally through the air and a similar card held horizontally and\r\nthen allowed to fall.\r\n\r\nI believe the whole mystery of aerial flotation lies here, and that as\r\nsoon as aerial floating machines are planned on this system, it will be\r\nfound that the problem of aerial transit--though presenting still many\r\ndifficulties of detail--is, nevertheless, perfectly soluble.--_R.A.\r\nProctor, in Newcastle Weekly Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ASSYRIAN BASS-RELIEF 2,700 YEARS OLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was exhibited at the last meeting of the Numismatic and\r\nAntiquarian Society, in Philadelphia, on May 7, an object of great\r\ninterest to archæologists, with which, says _The Church_, is also\r\nconnected a very curious history.\r\n\r\nIt appears that about forty years ago a young American minister, Rev.\r\nW.F. Williams, went as a missionary to Syria, and he visited among\r\nplaces of interest the site of ancient Nineveh about the time that\r\nAustin Henry Layard was making his famous explorations and discoveries;\r\nhe wrote to a friend in Philadelphia that he had secured for him a fine\r\npiece of Assyrian sculpture from one of the recently opened temples or\r\npalaces, representing a life size figure of a king, clad in royal robes,\r\nbearing in one hand a basket and in the other a fir cone. One portion\r\nof the stone was covered with hieroglyphics, and was as sharply cut as\r\nthough it had been carved by a modern hand instead of by an artist who\r\nwas sleeping in his grave when Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, was yet\r\nan infant.\r\n\r\nThe letter describing this treasure arrived duly, but the stones did not\r\ncome. It appears that the caravan bringing them down to Alexandretta,\r\nfrom whence they were to be shipped to Philadelphia, was attacked by\r\nrobbers, and the sculptured stones were thrown upon the desert as\r\nuseless, and there they remained for some years. Finally they were\r\nrecovered, shipped to this country (about twenty-five years ago), and\r\narriving at their destination during the absence of the consignee, were\r\ndeposited temporarily in a subterranean storeroom at his manufactory.\r\nIn some way they were overlooked, and here they have remained unopened\r\nuntil they were rediscovered a few days ago; meanwhile the missionary\r\nand his friend have both passed away, ignorant of the fact that the rare\r\ngift had finally reached its destination and had become again lost.\r\n\r\nThe cuneiform inscription is now being translated by an Assyrian scholar\r\n(Rev. Dr. J.P. Peters, of the Divinity School), and its identity is\r\nestablished; it came from the temple of King Assur-nazir-pal, a famous\r\nconqueror who reigned from 883 to 859 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe slab was cut into three sections, 3x3½ feet each, for convenience\r\nof transportation, and they have been somewhat broken on the journey;\r\nfortunately, however, this does not obliterate the writing.\r\n\r\nMr. Tolcott Williams, a son of the late missionary, was present at the\r\nmeeting of the Society, and gave an interesting account of the classic\r\nground from which the slab was obtained. It was one of a number lining\r\nthe walls of the palace of Assur-nazir-pal. The inscriptions, as\r\ntranslated by Dr. Peters, indicate that this particular slab was carved\r\nduring the first portion of this king's reign, and some conception\r\nof its great antiquity may be gained when it is stated that he was a\r\ncontemporary of Ahab and Jehosaphat; he was born not more than a\r\ncentury later than Solomon, and he reigned three centuries before\r\nNebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon. After the slabs were procured, it was\r\nnecessary to send them on the backs of camels a journey of eight hundred\r\nmiles across the Great Desert, through a region which was more or less\r\ninfested at all seasons with roving bands of robbers. Mr. Williams well\r\nremembered the interview between his father and the Arab camel owner,\r\nwho told several conflicting stories by way of preliminary to the\r\nconfession of the actual facts, in order to account for the non-arrival\r\nof the stones at Alexandretta, the sea coast town from whence they were\r\nto be shipped to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nMr. A.E. Outerbridge, Jr., gave a brief account of the finding of these\r\nstones in the subterranean storeroom where they had reposed for a period\r\nof a quarter of a century. The space between the slabs and the boxes\r\nhad been packed with camels' hair, which had in progress of time become\r\neaten by insects and reduced to a fine powder. The nails with which the\r\ncases were fastened were remarkable both for their peculiar shape and\r\nfor the extraordinary toughness of the iron, far excelling in this\r\nrespect the wrought iron made in America to day.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. J.P. Peters gave a very instructive exposition of the\r\nchronology of the kings of Assyria, their social and religious customs\r\nand ceremonies, their methods of warfare, their systems of architecture,\r\netc. He stated that the finest Assyrian bass-reliefs in the British\r\nMuseum came from the same palace as this specimen, the carving of which\r\nis not excelled by any period of the ancient glyptic art. The particular\r\npiece of alabaster selected by the artist for this slab was unusually\r\nfine, being mottled with nodules of crystallized gypsum.\r\n\r\nThe cuneiform inscription is not unlike the Hebrew in its character,\r\nresembling it about as closely as the Yorkshire dialect resembles good\r\nEnglish. The characters are so large and clearly cut that it is a\r\npleasure to read them after the laborious scrutiny of the minute\r\nBabylonish clay tablets. The inscription on this slab is identical with\r\na portion of that of the great \"Standard Monolith,\" on which this king\r\nsubsequently caused to be transcribed the pages, as it were, from the\r\ndifferent slabs which were apparently cut at intervals in his reign.\r\n\r\n_Translation of a Portion of the Cuneiform, Inscription_.--\"The palace\r\nof Assur-nazir-pal, servant of Assur, servant of the god Beltis, the\r\ngod Ninit, the shining one of Anu and Dagon, servant of the Great\r\nGods, Mighty King, king of hosts, king of the land of Assyria; son of\r\nBin-nirari, a strong warrior, who in the service of Assur his Lord\r\nmarched vigorously among the princes of the four regions, who had no\r\nequal, a mighty leader who had no rival, a king subduing all disobedient\r\nto him; who rules multitudes of men; crushing all his foes, even the\r\nmasses of the rebels.... The city of Calah, which my predecessor,\r\nShalmanezer, King of Assyria had built had fallen into decay: His city\r\nI rebuilt; a palace of cedar, box, cypress, for the seat of my royalty,\r\nfor the fullness of my princedom, to endure for generations, I placed\r\nupon it. With plates of copper I roofed it, I hung in its gates folding\r\ndoors of cedar wood, silver, gold, copper, and iron which my hands had\r\nacquired in the lands which I ruled, I gathered in great quantities, and\r\nplaced them in the midst thereof.\" O.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPOSITING NICKEL UPON ZINC.\r\n\r\nBy H.B. SLATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo those interested in the electro deposition of nickel upon zinc, the\r\nformula given below for a solution and a brief explanation of its use\r\nwill be of service.\r\n\r\nThe first sample of this solution was made as an experiment to see what\r\nsubstances could be added to a solution of the double sulphate of nickel\r\nand ammonium without spoiling it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to several other combinations and mixtures of solutions from\r\nwhich I succeeded in obtaining a good deposit, I found that the solution\r\nhere given would plate almost anything I put into it, and worked\r\nespecially well upon zinc. In its use no \"scraping\" or rescouring or any\r\nof the many operations which I have seen recommended for zinc needs\r\nbe resorted to, as the metal \"strikes\" at once and is deposited in\r\na continuous adherent film of reguline metal, and can be laid on as\r\nheavily as nickel is deposited generally.\r\n\r\nI believe that the addition of the ammonium chloride simply reduces\r\nthe resistance of the double sulphate solution, but the office of the\r\npotassium chloride is not so easily explained. At least, I have never\r\nbeen able to explain it satisfactorily to myself. It is certain,\r\nhowever, that the solution does not work as well without it, nor does\r\nthe addition of ammonium chloride in its stead give as fine a result.\r\n\r\nSome care is necessary in the management of the current, which should\r\nhave a density of about 17 amperes per square foot of surface--not much\r\nabove or below. This may seem a high figure, especially when it is\r\ndiscovered that there is a considerable evolution of gas during the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nI have repeatedly used this solution for coating articles of zinc, and\r\nalways with good success. I have exhibited samples of zinc plated in\r\nthis solution to those conversant with the deposition of nickel, and\r\nthey have expressed surprise at the appearance of the work. Some strips\r\nof sheet-zinc in my possession have been bent and cut into every\r\nconceivable shape without a sign of fracture or curling up at the edges\r\nof the nickel coating.\r\n\r\nThe solution is composed of--\r\n\r\n  Double sulphate of nickel and ammonium        10 ounces.\r\n  Ammonium chloride                              4   \"\r\n  Potassium chloride                             2   \"\r\n  Distilled water                                1 gallon.\r\n\r\nThe salts are dissolved in the water (hot), and the solution is worked\r\nat the ordinary temperature, about 16 degrees C.\r\n\r\nThe zinc may be cleansed in any suitable manner, but must be perfectly\r\nclean, of course, and finally rinsed in clean cold water and placed in\r\nthe bath as quickly as possible; care being taken that it is connected\r\nbefore it touches the solution.--_Electrical World_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA catalogue, containing brief notices of many important scientific\r\npapers heretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at this\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY.\r\n\r\nTERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION, $5 A YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSent by mail, postage prepaid, to subscribers in any part of the United\r\nStates or Canada.
