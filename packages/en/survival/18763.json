Mr. Mondollot has\r\nobtained such a result through a happy modification of the primitive\r\nsystem of the English engineer Bramah. He preserves the suction and\r\nforce pump but, while applying it to the same uses, he likewise employs\r\nit, by the aid of a special arrangement, so as to distribute the\r\nsulphuric acid automatically over the chalk in the generator, and to\r\nthus obtain a regular and continuous disengagement of carbonic acid gas.\r\nThe dangers and difficulties in the maneuver of an acid cock are\r\nobviated, the gasometer and its cumbersome accessories are dispensed\r\nwith, and the purification is more certain, owing to the regularity with\r\nwhich the gas traverses the washers.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying plate we have figured three types of these\r\napparatus. The first that we shall describe is arranged for the use of\r\nbicarbonate of soda. This apparatus consists (1) of a _generator_, C D,\r\n(2) of a double _washer_ G G, (3) of a _suction pump_, P, and (4) of a\r\n_saturator_, S (See Figs 1 to 9).\r\n\r\n_The Generator._--This consists of a cylindrical leaden receptacle, D,\r\non the bottom of which rests a leaden bell containing apertures, c, at\r\nits base. A partition, c, into which is screwed a leaden tube, C,\r\ncontaining apertures divides the interior of the bell into two\r\ncompartments. The upper of these latter is surmounted by a mouth, B,\r\nclosed by a clamp, and through which the bicarbonate of soda is\r\nintroduced. A definite quantity of water and sulphuric acid having been\r\npoured into the receptacle, D, a level tends to take place between the\r\nlatter and the bell, C, the liquid passing through the apertures. But\r\nthe acidulated water, coming in contact with the soda, sets free\r\ncarbonic acid gas, which, having no exit, forces the water back and\r\nstops the production of gas until the apparatus is set in motion. At\r\nthis moment, the suction of the pump causes a new inflow of acidulated\r\nwater upon the soda, from whence another disengagement of gas, and then\r\na momentary forcing of the water, whose level thus alternately rises and\r\nfalls and causes a continuous production of gas proportionate with the\r\nsuction of the pump.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of soda and acid is about 2 kilogrammes each for\r\ncharging 100 siphons or 150 bottles. The bicarbonate is known to be used\r\nup when the liquid in the generator is seen to descend to the bottom of\r\nthe water level, n, fixed to the vessel, D.\r\n\r\n_The Washer_ (Figs 1 and 4)--The gas, on leaving the generator, enters\r\nthe washer through a bent copper pipe, R. The washer is formed of two\r\novoid glass flasks G G, mounted on a bronze piece, L, to which they are\r\nfixed by screw rings, l, of the same metal. The two flasks, G G,\r\ncommunicate with each other only through the tinned-copper tube q,\r\nwhich is held in the mounting q, of the same metal. This latter is\r\nscrewed into the piece, L, and contains numerous apertures, through\r\nwhich the gas coming in from the pipe, R, passes to reach the upper\r\nflask, G. The gas is washed by bubbling up through water that has been\r\nintroduced through the cock, R. After it has traversed both flasks, it\r\nescapes through the copper pipe, p, into which it is sucked by the\r\npump, P.\r\n\r\n_The Pump_ (Figs 1, 5 and 6)--This consists of a cylindrical chamber, P,\r\nof bronze, bolted to a bracket on the frame, and cast in a piece, with\r\nthe suction valve chamber, P, in which the valve, p, plays. It is\r\nsurmounted by the distributing valve chamber P squared. This latter is held\r\nby means of two nuts screwed on to the extremity of the rods, p cubed,\r\nconnected with the shell, E, of the distributing-cock, E. In the shell,\r\nE, terminates, on one side, the pipe, p, through which enters the gas\r\nfrom the washer, and, on the other, the pipe i, that communicates with\r\na feed-reservoir not shown in the cuts. The cock E, permits of the\r\nsimultaneous regulation of the entrance of the gas and water. Its\r\nposition is shown by an index e, passing over a graduated dial, _eš_.\r\nFrom the distributing valve chamber, P squared the pipe, s, leads the\r\nmixture of water and gas under pressure into\r\n\r\n_The Saturator_, S (Figs 1, 7 and 9)--This consists of a large copper\r\nvessel, s, affixed to the top of the frame through the intermedium of\r\na bronze collar h, and a self closing bottom H. This latter is\r\nprovided with two pipes, one of which, s, leads the mixture of water\r\nand carbonic acid forced by the pump, and the other, b, communicates\r\nwith the siphons or bottles to be filled. The pipe, b, is not affixed\r\ndirectly to the bottom, but is connected therewith through the\r\nintermedium of a cock, r. The object of the broken form of this pipe\r\nis to cause the pressure to act according to the axis of the screw, r,\r\nwhich is maneuvered by the key, r squared.\r\n\r\nThe water under pressure, having been forced into the vessel, S, is\r\nsubmitted therein to an agitation that allows it to dissolve a larger\r\nquantity of gas. Such agitation is produced by two pairs of paddles, J\r\nJ, mounted at the extremity of an axle actuated by the wheel, A, through\r\nthe intermedium of gearings, g and g.\r\n\r\nThe course of the operation in the saturator may be followed by an\r\ninspection of the water level, n, seen at the front and side in Figs.\r\n2 and 3. This apparatus, in which the pressure reaches 4 to 6\r\natmospheres in the manufacture of Seltzer water or gaseous lemonade in\r\nbottles, and from 10 to 12 atmospheres in that of Seltzer water in\r\nsiphons, is provided also with a pressure gauge, m, and a safety\r\nvalve, both screwed, as is also the tube, n squared, into a sphere, S, on\r\nthe top of the saturator.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus for Using Carbonate of Lime_ (Figs 2, 3, and 10)--When chalk\r\nis acted upon by sulphuric acid, there is formed an insoluble sulphate\r\nwhich, by covering the chalk, prevents the action of the acid from\r\ncontinuing if care be not taken to constantly agitate the materials.\r\nThis has led to a change in the arrangement of the generator in the\r\napparatus designed for the use of chalk.\r\n\r\nIt consists in this case of a leaden vessel, D, having a hemispherical\r\nbottom set into a cylindrical cast iron base, K, and of an agitator\r\nsimilar to that shown in Fig. 11, for keeping the chalk in suspension in\r\nthe water. These latter materials are introduced through the mouth, B\r\n(Fig. 3). Then a special receptacle, C, of lead, shown in detail in Fig.\r\n10, and the cock, c, of which is kept closed, is filled with sulphuric\r\nacid. The acid is not introduced directly into the vessel, C, but is\r\npoured into the cylinder, C, whose sides contain numerous apertures\r\nwhich prevent foreign materials from passing into the siphon tube c,\r\nand obstructing it.\r\n\r\nTo put the apparatus in operation, the acid cock, c, is opened and the\r\nwheel, A, is turned, thus setting in motion both the pump piston, P, and\r\nthe agitator, within S and D. Then the play of the pump produces a\r\nsuction in the washers and from thence in the generator and causes the\r\nacid in the vessel, C, to flow into the generator through the leaden\r\nsiphon tubes, c. Coming in contact with the chalk in suspension, the\r\nacid produces a disengagement of gas which soon establishes sufficient\r\npressure to stop the flow of the acid and drive it back into the siphon\r\ntube. The play of the pump continuing, a new suction takes place and\r\nconsequently a momentary flow of acid and a new disengagement of gas.\r\nThus the production of the latter is continuous, and is regulated by the\r\nvery action of the pump, without the operator having to maneuver an\r\nacid-cock. The latter he only has to open when he sets the apparatus in\r\noperation, and to close it when he stops it.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the washer is the same as in the preceding apparatus,\r\nsave that a larger cylindrical copper reservoir, G', is substituted for\r\nthe lower flask. The pump and saturator offer nothing peculiar.\r\n\r\nA bent tube, u, which communicates with the generator, D, on one side,\r\nand with a cylindrical tube, V, ending in a glass vessel on the other,\r\nserves as a safety-valve for both the generator and the acid vessel.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of chalk is about 2.5 kilogrammes, and the same of acid,\r\nfor charging 100 siphons or 150 bottles. The apparatus shown in the\r\nfigure is capable of charging 600 siphons or 900 bottles per day.\r\n\r\n_An Apparatus Completely Mechanical in Operation_ (Fig. 11).--This\r\napparatus consists of two very distinct parts. The saturator, pump, and\r\ndriving shaft are supported by a hollow base, in whose interior are\r\nplaced a copper washer and the water-inlet controlled by a float-cock.\r\nThis part of the apparatus is not shown in the plate. The generator,\r\npartially shown in Fig. 11, is placed on a base of its own, and is\r\nconnected by a pipe with the rest of the apparatus. It consists of two\r\nsimilar generators, D, made of copper lined with lead, and working\r\nalternately, so as to avoid all stoppages in the manufacture when the\r\nmaterials are being renewed. The pipe, d, connecting the two parts of\r\nthe apparatus forks so as to lead the gas from one or the other of the\r\ngenerators, whence it passes into the copper washer within the base,\r\nthen into the glass indicating washer, and then to the pump which forces\r\nit into the saturator.\r\n\r\nEach of the generators communicates by special pipes, a, with a single\r\nsafety vessel, V, that operates the same as in the preceding apparatus.\r\nThe agitator, Q, is of bronze, and is curved as shown in Fig. 11.\r\n\r\nThe production of this type of apparatus is dependent upon the number of\r\nsiphons that can be filled by a siphon filler working without\r\ninterruption.--_Machines, Outils et Appareils._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDETECTION AND ESTIMATION OF FUSEL OIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil quite recently we have had no accurate method for the\r\ndetermination of fusel oil in alcohol or brandy. In 1837 Meurer\r\nsuggested a solution of one part of silver nitrate in nine parts of\r\nwater as a reagent for its detection, stating that when added to alcohol\r\ncontaining fusel oil, a reddish brown color is produced, and in case\r\nlarge quantities are present, a dark brown precipitate is formed. It was\r\nsoon found, however, that other substances than amyl alcohol produce\r\nbrown colored solutions with silver nitrate; and Bouvier[1] observed\r\nthat on adding potassium iodide to alcohol containing fusel oil, the\r\nsolution is colored yellow, from the decomposition of the iodide.\r\nSubsequently Boettger[2] proved that potassium iodide is not decomposed\r\nby pure amyl alcohol, and that the decomposition is due to the presence\r\nof acids contained in fusel oil. More accurate results are obtained by\r\nusing a very dilute solution of potassium permanganate, which is\r\ndecomposed by amyl alcohol much more rapidly than by ethyl alcohol.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Zeitschrift f. Anal. Chem. xi., 343.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Dingler's Polytech. Jour., ccxii., 516.]\r\n\r\nDepre[3] determines fusel oil by oxidizing a definite quantity of the\r\nalcohol in a closed vessel with potassium bichromate and sulphuric acid.\r\nafter removal of excess of the oxidizing reagents, the organic acids are\r\ndistilled, and, by repeated fractional distillation, the acetic acid is\r\nseparated as completely as possible. The remaining acids are saturated\r\nwith barium hydroxide, and the salts analyzed; a difference between the\r\npercentage of barium found and that of barium in barium acetate proves\r\nthe presence of fusel oil, and the amount of difference gives some idea\r\nof its quantity. Betelli[4] dilutes 5 c.c. of the alcohol to be tested\r\nwith 6 to 7 volumes of water, and adds 15 to 20 drops of chloroform and\r\nshakes thoroughly. If fusel oil is present, its odor may be detected by\r\nevaporating the chloroform; or, by treatment with sulphuric acid and\r\nsodium acetate, the ether is obtained, which can be readily recognized.\r\nJorissen[5] tests for fusel oil by adding 10 drops of colorless aniline\r\nand 2 to 3 drops of hydrochloric acid to 10 c.c. of the alcohol. In the\r\npresence of fusel oil a red color is produced within a short time, which\r\ncan be detected when not more than 0.1 per cent. is present. But\r\nFoerster[6] objects to this method because he finds the color to be due\r\nto the presence of furfurol, and that pure amyl alcohol gives no color\r\nwith aniline and hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: Pharm. J. Trans. [3] vi., 867.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: Berichte d. Deutschen Chem. Gesellsch., viii., 72.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: Pharm. Centralhalle, xxii., 3.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: Berichte d. Deutsch. Chem. Gesellsch., xv., 230.]\r\n\r\nHager[7] detects fusel oil as follows: If the spirit contains more than\r\n60 per cent. of alcohol, it is diluted with an equal volume of water and\r\nsome glycerine added, pieces of filter paper are then saturated with the\r\nliquid and exposed to the After the evaporation of the alcohol, the odor\r\nof the fusel oil can be readily detected. For the quantitative\r\ndetermination he distills 100 c.c. of the alcohol in a flask of 150 to\r\n200 c.c. capacity connected with a condenser, and so arranged that the\r\napparatus does not extend more than 20 cm. above the water bath. This\r\narrangement prevents the fusel oil from passing over. If the alcohol is\r\nstronger than 70 per cent., and the height of the distillation apparatus\r\nis not more than 17 cm., the residue in the flask may be weighed as\r\nfusel oil. With a weaker alcohol, or an apparatus which projects further\r\nout of the water bath, the residual fusel oil is mixed with water. It\r\ncan, however, be separated by adding strong alcohol and redistilling, or\r\nby treating with ether, which dissolves the amyl alcohol, and\r\ndistilling, the temperature being raised finally to 60 deg..\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: Pharm. Centralhalle, xxii., 236.]\r\n\r\nMarquardt,[8] like Betelli, extracts the fusel oil from alcohol by means\r\nof chloroform, and by oxidation converts it into valeric acid. From the\r\nquantity of barium valerate found he calculates the amount of amyl\r\nalcohol present in the original solution; 150 c.c. of the spirit, which\r\nhas been diluted so as to contain 12 to 15 per cent. of alcohol, are\r\nshaken up thoroughly with 50 c.c. of chloroform, the aqueous layer drawn\r\noff, and shaken with a fresh portion of chloroform. This treatment is\r\nrepeated several times. The extracts are then united, and washed\r\nrepeatedly with water. The chloroform, which is now free from alcohol\r\nand contains all the fusel oil, is treated with a solution of 5 grammes\r\nof potassium bichromate in 30 grammes of water and 2 grammes of\r\nsulphuric acid, and then heated in a closed flask for six hours on a\r\nwater bath at 85 deg.. The contents of the flask are then distilled, the\r\ndistillate saturated with barium carbonate, and the chloroform\r\ndistilled; the residue is evaporated to a small volume, the excess of\r\nbarium carbonate filtered off, and the filtrate evaporated to dryness\r\nand weighed. The residue is dissolved in water, a few drops of nitric\r\nacid added, and the solution divided into two portions. In the first\r\nportion the barium is determined; in the second the barium chloride. The\r\ntotal per cent. of barium minus that of barium chloride gives the amount\r\npresent as barium valerate, from which is calculated the per cent. of\r\namyl alcohol. By this process the author has determined one part of\r\nfusel oil in ten thousand of alcohol. To detect very minute quantities\r\nof fusel oil, the chloroform extracts are treated with several drops of\r\nsulphuric acid and enough potassium permanganate to keep the solution\r\nred for twenty-four hours. If allowed to stand in a test tube, the odor\r\nof valeric aldehyde will first be noticed, then that of amyl valerate,\r\nand lastly that of valeric acid.--_Amer. Chem. Journal._\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: Berichte d. Deutsch. Chem. Gesellsch., xv., 1,370\r\n    and 1,663.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON SILICON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is known that platinum heated in a forge fire, in contact with\r\ncarbon, becomes fusible. Boussingault has shown that this is due to the\r\nformation of a silicide of platinum by means of the reduction of the\r\nsilica of the carbon by the metal. MM. P. Schuetzenberger and A. Colson\r\nhave produced the same phenomenon by heating to white heat a slip of\r\nplatinum in the center of a thick layer of lampblack free from silica.\r\n\r\nThe increase in weight of the metal and the augmentation of its\r\nfusibility were found to be due, in this case also, to a combination\r\nwith silicon. As the silicon could not come directly from the carbon\r\nwhich surrounded the platinum, MM. Schuetzenberger and Colson have\r\nendeavored to discover under what form it could pass from the walls of\r\nthe crucible through a layer of lampblack several centimeters in\r\nthickness, in spite of a volatility amounting to almost nothing under\r\nthe conditions of the experiment. They describe the following\r\nexperiments as serving to throw some light upon the question:\r\n\r\n1. A thin slip of platinum rolled in a spiral is placed in a small\r\ncrucible of retort carbon closed by a turned cover of the same material.\r\nThis is placed in a second larger crucible of refractory clay, and the\r\nintervening space filled with lampblack tightly packed. The whole is\r\nthen heated to white heat for an hour and a half in a good wind furnace.\r\nAfter cooling, the platinum is generally found to have been fused into a\r\nbutton, with a marked increase in weight due to taking up silicon, which\r\nhas penetrated in the form of vapor through the walls of the interior\r\ncrucible.\r\n\r\n2. If, in the preceding experiment, the lampblack be replaced by a\r\nmixture of lampblack and rutile in fine powder, the slip of platinum\r\nremains absolutely intact, and does not change in weight. Thus the\r\ntitaniferous packing recommended by Sainte-Claire Deville for preventing\r\nthe access of nitrogen in experiments at high temperatures also prevents\r\nthe passage of silicon. A mixture of carbon and finely divided iron is,\r\non the contrary, ineffectual. These facts seem to indicate that nitrogen\r\nplays a part in the transportation of the silicon, as this is only\r\nprevented by the same means made use of in order to prevent the passage\r\nof nitrogen.\r\n\r\n3. The volatility of free silicon at a high temperature is too slight to\r\naccount for the alteration of the platinum at a distance. This can be\r\nshown by placing several decigrammes of crystallized silicon on the\r\nbottom of a small crucible of retort carbon, covering the silicon with a\r\nsmall flat disk of retort carbon upon which is placed the slip of\r\nplatinum. The crucible, closed by its turned cover, is then enveloped in\r\na titaniferous packing and kept at a brilliant white heat for an hour\r\nand a half. The metal is found to have only very slightly increased in\r\nweight, and its properties remain unaltered. This experiment was\r\nrepeated several times with the same result. If, however, the\r\ncrystallized silicon be replaced by powdered calcined silica, the\r\nplatinum, placed upon the carbon disk, fuses and increases in weight,\r\nwhile the silica loses weight. The theory of these curious phenomena is\r\nvery difficult to establish on account of the high temperatures which\r\nare necessary for their manifestation, but it may be concluded, at\r\npresent, that nitrogen and probably oxygen also play some part in the\r\ntransportation of the silicon across the intervening space, and that the\r\ncarbosilicious compounds recently described by MM. Schuetzenberger and\r\nColson also take part in the phenomenon.--_Comptes Rendus_, xciv.,\r\n1,710.--_Amer. Chem. Journal._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANNOUS NITRATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Royal Powder Works at Spandau, Prussia, frequent ignition of the\r\npowder at a certain stage of the process led to an examination of the\r\nmachinery, when it was found that where, at certain parts, bronze pieces\r\nwhich were soldered were in constant contact with the moist powder, the\r\nsolder was much corroded and in part entirely destroyed, and that in the\r\njoints had collected a substance which, on being scraped out with a\r\nchisel, exploded with emission of sparks. It was suspected that the\r\nformation of this explosive material was in some way connected with the\r\ncorrosion of the solder, and the subject was referred for investigation\r\nto Rudolph Weber, of the School of Technology, at Berlin. The main\r\nresults of his investigation are here given.\r\n\r\nThe explosive properties of the substance indicated a probable\r\nnitro-compound of one of the solder metals (tin and lead), and as the\r\nlead salts are more stable and better understood than those of tin, it\r\nwas resolved to investigate the latter, in hope of obtaining a similar\r\nexplosive compound. Experiments on the action of moist potassium nitrate\r\non pure tin led to no result, as no explosive body was formed. Stannous\r\nnitrate, Sn(NO_{3})_{2}, formed by the action of dilute nitric acid on\r\ntin, has long been known, but only in solution, as it is decomposed on\r\nevaporating. By adding freshly precipitated moist brown stannous oxide\r\nto cool nitric acid of sp. gr. 1.20, as long as solution occurred, and\r\nthen cooling the solution to -20 deg., Weber obtained an abundance of\r\ncrystals of the composition Sn(NO_{3})_{2} + 20H_{2}O. They resemble\r\ncrystals of potassium chlorate. They cannot be kept, as they liquefy at\r\nordinary temperatures. An insoluble _basic_ salt was obtained by\r\ndigesting an excess of moist stannous oxide in solution of stannous\r\nnitrate, or by adding to a solution of stannous nitrate by degrees, with\r\nconstant stirring, a quantity of sodium carbonate solution insufficient\r\nfor complete precipitation. Thus obtained, the basic salt, which has the\r\ncomposition Sn_{2}N_{2}O_{7}, is a snow-white crystalline powder, which\r\nis partially decomposed by water, and slowly oxidized by long exposure\r\nto the air, or by heating to 100 deg.. By rapid heating to a higher\r\ntemperature, as well as by percussion and friction, it explodes\r\nviolently, giving off a shower of sparks. This compound is also formed\r\nwhen a fine spray of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.20) is thrown upon a surface\r\nof tin or solder. It is also formed when tin or solder is exposed to the\r\naction of a solution of copper nitrate, and thus formed presents the\r\nproperties already described.\r\n\r\nIn this, then, we have a probable cause of the explosions occurring in\r\nthe powder works; but the explanation of the formation of the substance\r\nis wanting, as potassium nitrate was shown not to give an explosive\r\nsubstance with tin. A thin layer of a mixture of sulphur and potassium\r\nnitrate was placed between sheets of tin and copper foil, and allowed to\r\nstand, being kept constantly moist. After a time the copper was found to\r\nhave become coated with sulphide, while the tin was largely converted\r\ninto the explosive basic nitrate. The conditions are obviously the same\r\nas those found in the powder machinery, where bronze and tin solder are\r\nconstantly in contact with moist gunpowder. The chemical action is\r\nprobably this: the sulphur of the powder forms, with the copper of the\r\nbronze, copper sulphide; this is oxidized to sulphate, which reacts with\r\nthe niter of the powder, forming potassium sulphate and copper nitrate;\r\nthe latter, as shown above, then forms with the tin of the solder the\r\nexplosive basic nitrate, which, being insoluble, gradually collects in\r\nthe joints, and finally leads to an explosion.--_Journal fuer Praktische\r\nChemie._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETALLIC THORIUM.\r\n\r\nBy L.F. NILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe density of thorium as obtained by reducing the anhydrous chloride by\r\nmeans of sodium was found by Chydenius, 7.657 to 7.795. The author has\r\nobtained metallic thorium by heating sodium with the double anhydrous\r\nthorium potassium chloride, in presence of sodium chloride in an iron\r\ncrucible. After treating the residue with water there remains a grayish,\r\nheavy, sparkling powder, which under the microscope appears to consist\r\nof very small crystals. Metallic thorium is brittle and almost\r\ninfusible; the powder takes a metallic luster under pressure, is\r\npermanent in the air at temperatures up to 120 deg., takes fire below a red\r\nheat either in air or oxygen, and burns with a dazzling luster, leaving\r\na residue of perfectly white thoria. If heated with chlorine, bromine,\r\niodine, and sulphur, it combines with them with ignition. It is not\r\nattacked by water, cold or hot. Dilute sulphuric acid occasions the\r\ndisengagement of hydrogen, especially if heated, but the metal is acted\r\non very slowly. Concentrated sulphuric acid with the aid of heat attacks\r\nthe metal very slightly, evolving sulphurous anhydride. Nitric acid,\r\nstrong or weak, has no sensible action. Fuming hydrochloric acid and\r\n_aqua regia_ attack thorium readily, but the alkalies are without\r\naction. The metal examined by the author behaves with the reagents in\r\nquestion the same as did the specimens obtained by Berzelius. The mean\r\nspecific gravity of pure thorium is about 11. Hence it would seem that\r\nthe metal obtained by Chydenius must have contained much foreign matter.\r\nThe specific gravity of pure thoria is 10.2207 to 10.2198. The\r\nequivalent and the density being known, we may calculate the atomic\r\nvolume. If we admit that the metal is equivalent to 4 atoms of hydrogen,\r\nwe obtain the value 21.1. This number coincides with the atomic volumes\r\nof zirconium (21.7), cerium (21.1), lanthanum (22.6), and didymium\r\n(21.5). This analogy is certainly not due to chance; it rather confirms\r\nthe opinion which I have put forward in connection with my researches on\r\nthe selenites, on certain chloro-platinates and chloro-platinites, etc.,\r\nthat the elements of the rare earths form a series of quadrivalent\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[AMERICAN CHEMICAL JOURNAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH WOeHLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one but a chemist can appreciate the full significance of the brief\r\nmessage which came to us a month ago without warning--\"Woehler is dead!\"\r\nWhat need be added to it? No chemist was better known or more honored\r\nthan Woehler, and none ever deserved distinction and honor more than he.\r\nHis life was made up of a series of brilliant successes, which not only\r\ncompelled the admiration of the world at large, but directed the\r\nthoughts of his fellow workers, and led to results of the highest\r\nimportance to science.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible in a few words to give a correct account of the work of\r\nWoehler, and to show in what way his life and work have been of such\r\ngreat value to chemistry. Could he himself direct the preparation of\r\nthis notice, the writer knows that his advice would be, \"Keep to the\r\nfacts.\" So far as any one phrase can characterize the teachings of\r\nWoehler, that one does it; and though enthusiasm prompts to eulogy, let\r\nus rather recall the plain facts of his life, and let them, in the main,\r\nspeak for themselves.[1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: See Kopp's \"Geschichte der Chemie,\" iv., 440.]\r\n\r\nHe was born in the year 1800 at Eschersheim, a village near\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Main. From his earliest years the study of nature\r\nappears to have been attractive to him. He took great delight in\r\ncollecting minerals and in performing chemical and physical experiments.\r\nWhile still a boy, he associated with a Dr. Buch, of Frankfort, and was\r\naided by this gentleman, who did what he could to encourage in the young\r\nstudent his inclination toward the natural sciences. The first paper\r\nwhich bears the name of Woehler dates from this period, and is upon the\r\npresence of selenium in the iron pyrites from Kraslitz. In 1820 he went\r\nto the University of Marburg to study medicine. While there he did not,\r\nhowever, neglect the study of chemistry. He was at that time\r\nparticularly interested in an investigation on certain cyanogen\r\ncompounds. In 1821 he went to Heidelberg, and in 1823 he received the\r\ndegree of Doctor of Medicine. L. Gmelin became interested in him, and it\r\nwas largely due to Gmelin's influence that Woehler gave up his intention\r\nof practicing medicine, and concluded to devote himself entirely to\r\nchemistry. For further instruction in his chosen science, Woehler went to\r\nStockholm to receive instruction from Berzelius, in whose laboratory he\r\ncontinued to work from the fall of 1823 until the middle of the\r\nfollowing year. Only a few years since, in a communication entitled\r\n\"Jugenderinnerungen eines Chemikers,\" he gave a fascinating account of\r\nhis journey to Stockholm and his experiences while working with\r\nBerzelius. On his return to Germany, he was called to teach chemistry in\r\nthe recently founded municipal trade school (Gewerbschule) at Berlin. He\r\naccepted the call, and remained in Berlin until 1832, when he went to\r\nCassel to live. In a short time he was called upon to take part in the\r\ndirection of the higher trade school at Cassel. He continued to teach\r\nand work in Cassel until 1836, when he was appointed Professor of\r\nChemistry in Goettingen. This office he held at the time of his death,\r\nSeptember 23, 1882.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 Woehler became acquainted with Liebig, and an intimate friendship\r\nresulted, which continued until the death of Liebig, a few years ago.\r\nThough they lived far apart, they met during the vacations at their\r\nhomes, or traveled together. Many important investigations were\r\nconceived by them as they talked over the problems of chemistry, and\r\nmany papers appeared under both their names, containing the results of\r\ntheir joint work. Among such papers may be mentioned: \"On Cyanic Acid\"\r\n(1830); \"On Mellithic Acid\" (1830); \"On Sulphotartaric Acid\" (1831); \"On\r\nOil of Bitter Almonds, Benzoic Acid, and Related Compounds\" (1832); \"On\r\nthe Formation of Oil of Bitter Almonds from Amygdalin\" (1837); and \"On\r\nUric Acid\" (1837).\r\n\r\nOf the papers included in the above list, the two which most attract\r\nattention are those \"On the Oil of Bitter Almonds\" and \"On Uric Acid.\"\r\nIn the former it was shown for the first time that in analogous carbon\r\ncompounds there are groups which remain unchanged, though the compounds\r\ncontaining them may, in other respects, undergo a variety of changes.\r\nThis is the conception of radicals or residues as we use it at the\r\npresent day. It cannot be denied that this conception has done very much\r\nto simplify the study of organic compounds. The full value of the\r\ndiscovery was recognized at once by Berzelius, who, in a letter to the\r\nauthors of the paper, proposed that they should call their radical proin\r\nor orthrin (the dawn of day), for the reason that the assumption of its\r\nexistence might be likened to the dawn of a new day in chemistry. The\r\nstudy of this paper should form a part of the work of every advanced\r\nstudent of chemistry. It is a model of all that is desirable in a\r\nscientific memoir. The paper on uric acid is remarkable for the number\r\nof interesting transformation products described in it, and the skill\r\ndisplayed in devising methods for the isolation and purification of the\r\nnew compounds. Comparatively little has been added to our knowledge of\r\nuric acid since the appearance of the paper of Liebig and Woehler.\r\n\r\nIt would lead too far to attempt to give a complete list of the papers\r\nwhich have appeared under the name of Woehler alone. In 1828 he made the\r\nremarkable discovery that when an aqueous solution of ammonium cyanate,\r\nCNONH_{4}, is evaporated, the salt is completely transformed into urea,\r\nwhich has the same percentage composition. It would be difficult to\r\nexaggerate the importance of this discovery. That a substance like urea,\r\nwhich up to that time had only been met with as a product of processes\r\nwhich take place in the animal body, should be formed in the laboratory\r\nout of inorganic compounds, appeared to chemists then to be little less\r\nthan a miracle. To-day such facts are among the commonest of chemistry.\r\nThe many brilliant syntheses of well-known and valuable organic\r\ncompounds which have been made during the past twenty years are results\r\nof this discovery of Woehler.\r\n\r\nIn 1823 he published a paper on secretion, in the urine, of substances\r\nwhich are foreign to the animal organism, but which are brought into the\r\nbody. He discovered the transformation of neutral organic salts into\r\ncarbonates by the process of assimilation.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 he investigated the dimorphism of arsenious acid and antimony\r\noxide. In 1841 he made the discovery that dimorphous bodies have\r\ndifferent fusing points, according as they are in the crystallized or\r\namorphous condition.\r\n\r\nAmong the more remarkable of his investigations in inorganic chemistry\r\nare those on methods for the preparation of potassium (1823); on\r\ntungsten compounds (1824); the preparation of aluminum (1827); of\r\nglucinum and yttrium (1828). In 1856, working with Ste. Claire Deville,\r\nhe discovered crystallized boron.\r\n\r\nAnalytical methods were improved in many ways, and excellent new methods\r\nwere introduced by him. Further, he did a great deal for the improvement\r\nof the processes of applied chemistry.\r\n\r\nWith Liebig he was associated in editing the \"Annalen der Chemie and\r\nPharmacie\" and the \"Handwoerterbuch der Chemie.\" He wrote a remarkably\r\nuseful and popular \"Grundriss der Chemie.\" The part relating to\r\ninorganic chemistry appeared first in 1831, and was in use until a few\r\nyears ago, when Fittig wrote his \"Grundriss\" on the same plan, a work\r\nwhich supplanted its prototype.\r\n\r\nThe above will serve to give some idea of the great activity of Woehler's\r\nlife, and the fruitfulness of his labors. While thus contributing\r\nlargely by his own work directly to the growth of chemistry, he did\r\nperhaps as much in the capacity of teacher. Many of the active chemists\r\nof the present day have enjoyed the advantages of Woehler's instruction,\r\nand many can trace their success to the impulse gathered in the\r\nlaboratory at Goettingen. The hand of the old master appears in\r\ninvestigations carried on to-day by his pupils.\r\n\r\nWoehler's was not a speculative mind. He took very little part in the\r\nmany important discussions on chemical theories which engaged the\r\nattention of such men as Dumas, Gerhardt, Berzelius, and Liebig, during\r\nthe active period of his life. He preferred to deal with the facts as\r\nsuch; and no one ever dealt with the facts of chemistry more\r\nsuccessfully. He had a genius for methods which has never been equaled.\r\nThe obstacles which had baffled his predecessors were surmounted by him\r\nwith ease. He was in this respect a truly great man.\r\n\r\nPersonally, Woehler was modest and retiring. His life was simple and\r\nunostentatious. He had a kindly disposition, which endeared him to his\r\nstudents, to which fact many American chemists who were students at\r\nGoettingen during the time of Woehler's activity can cordially testify. In\r\nshort, it may be said deliberately that Woehler, as a chemist and as a\r\nman, was a fit model for all of us and for those who will come after us.\r\nThough he has gone, his methods live in every laboratory. His spirit\r\nreigns in many; could it reign in all, the chemical world would be the\r\nbetter for it.\r\n\r\nI.R.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUIS FAVRE, CONSTRUCTOR OF THE ST. GOTHARD TUNNEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now already a year that the locomotive has been rolling over the\r\nSt. Gothard road, crossing at a flash the distance separating Basle from\r\nMilan, and passing rapidly from the dark and damp defiles of German\r\nSwitzerland into the sun lit plains of Lombardy. Our neighbors\r\nuproariously feted the opening of this great international artery, which\r\nthey consider as their personal and exclusive work, as well from a\r\ntechnical point of view as from that of the economic result that they\r\nhad proposed to attain--the creation of a road which, in the words of\r\nBismarck, \"glorifies no other nation.\" As regards the piercing of the\r\nGothard, the initiative does, in fact, belong by good right to the\r\npowerful \"Iron Chancellor,\" so we have never dreamed of robbing Germany\r\nof the glory (and it is a true glory) of having created the second of\r\nthe great transalpine routes, that open to European products a new gate\r\nto the Oriental world. It seems to us, however, that in the noisy\r\nconcert of acclamations that echoed during the days of the fetes over\r\nthe inauguration of the line, a less modest place might have been made\r\nfor those who, with invincible tenacity and rare talent, directed the\r\ntechnical part of the work, and especially those 15 kilometers of\r\ncolossal boring--the great St. Gothard Tunnel, which ranks in the\r\nhistory of great public works side by side with the piercing of the\r\nFrejus, and the marvelous digging of Suez and Panama.\r\n\r\nWe recall just now the names of those who, during nearly ten years, have\r\ncontributed with entire disinterestedness to the completion of this\r\ncolossal work. Over all stands a figure of very peculiar\r\noriginality--that of M. Louis Favre, the general contractor of the great\r\ntunnel, whose name will remain attached to the creation of this work\r\nthrough the Helvetian Alps, like that of Sommeiller to the great tunnel\r\nof the Frejus, and that of De Lesseps to the artificial straits that\r\nhenceforward join the oceans. Having myself had the honor of occupying\r\nthe position of general secretary of the enterprise under consideration,\r\nI have been enabled to make a close acquaintance with the man who was so\r\nremarkable in all respects, and who, after passing his entire life in\r\ngreat public works, died like a soldier on the field of honor--in the\r\ndepths of the tunnel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS FAVRE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DOWNFALL OF THE TITANS, CONQUERED BY THE GENIUS OF\r\nMAN. (Monument at Turin to Commemorate the Tunneling of the Alps.)]\r\n\r\nI saw Favre, for the first time, in Geneva, in 1872, a few days after he\r\nhad assumed the responsibility of undertaking the great work. He had\r\nbeen living since the war on his magnificent Plongeon estate, on the\r\nright bank of the lake. There was no need of dancing attendance in order\r\nto reach the contractor of the greatest work that has been accomplished\r\nup to the present time, for M. Favre was easy of access. We had scarcely\r\npassed five minutes together than we we were conversing as we often did\r\nlater after an acquaintance of six years. After making known to him the\r\nobject of my visit, the desire of being numbered among the _personnel_\r\nof his enterprise, the conversation quickly took that turn of\r\nmirthfulness that was at the bottom of Favre's character. \"This is the\r\nfirst time,\" said he to me, laughing, \"that I ever worked with Germans,\r\nand I had not yet struck the first blow of the pick on the Gothard when\r\nthey began to quibble about our contract of the 8th of last August. Ah!\r\nthat agreement of August 8th! How I had to change and re-change it,\r\nlater on. If this thing continues, we shall have a pretty quarrel,\r\nconsidering that I do not understand a word of the multiple\r\ninterpretations of their _charabia_. I ought to have mistrusted this.\r\nBut you see I have remained inactive during the whole of this\r\nunfortunate war. I was not made for promenading in the paths of a\r\ngarden, and I should have died of chagrin if such inaction had had to be\r\nprolonged. When one lives, as I have, for thirty years around lumber\r\nyards, it is difficult to accustom one's self to the sedentary and\r\nsecluded life that I have led here for nearly two years.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said, with just pride, Louis Favre had, indeed, before becoming\r\nthe first contractor of public works in the world, lived for a long time\r\nin lumber yards. The years that so many other better instructed but less\r\nlearned persons, who were afterward to gladly accept his authority, had\r\ngiven up to their studies, Favre had passed in the humble shop of his\r\nfather, a carpenter at Chene, a small village at a half league from\r\nGeneva. It soon becoming somewhat irksome for him in the village, he\r\nleft the paternal workbench to start on what is called the \"tour of\r\nFrance.\" He was then eighteen years of age. Three years afterward, he\r\nwas undertaking small works. It was not long ere he was remarked by the\r\nengineers conducting the latter, and he was soon called to give his\r\nadvice on all difficult questions. Between times, Favre had courageously\r\nstudied the principal bases of such sciences as were to be useful to\r\nhim. In the evening, he made up at the public school what was lacking in\r\nhis early instruction; not that he hoped to make a complete study for an\r\nengineer, but only to learn the indispensable. He was, before all\r\nthings, a practical man, who made up for the enforced insufficiency of\r\nhis technical knowledge by a _coup d'oeil_ of surprising accuracy.\r\nHere it may be said to me that the piercing of the great St. Gothard\r\nTunnel was accompanied by considerable loss. That is true, but it must\r\nbe recalled also that this colossal work was accomplished amid the most\r\ninsurmountable difficulties which ever presented themselves. In spite of\r\nthis, the cost of the tunnel per running foot was also a third less than\r\nthat of the great Mont Cenis Tunnel.\r\n\r\nWhen Favre undertook the St. Gothard, he already reckoned to his credit\r\nnumerous victories in the domain of public works, especially in the\r\nconstruction of subterranean ones. The majority of tunnels of any length\r\nwhich, since the beginning of the establishment of railways, have been\r\nconsidered as works of some proportions (the Blaisy Tunnel, for\r\ninstance), were executed by him, in addition to other open air works. So\r\nFavre reached the St. Gothard full of hope. The battle with the colossus\r\ndid not displease him, and his courage and his confidence in the success\r\nof the work seemed to increase in measure as the circumstances\r\nsurrounding the boring became more difficult. In the presence of the\r\nterrible inundation of the gallery of Airolo and the falling of\r\naquiferous rocks, creating in the subterranean work so desperate a\r\nsituation that a large number of very experienced engineers almost\r\nadvised the abandonment of the works, Favre remained impassive. Amid the\r\ngeneral apprehension, which, it may be readily comprehended, was felt in\r\nsuch a situation he made his confident and cheerful voice heard,\r\nreviving the ardor of all, and speaking disdainfully of \"that\r\ninsignificant Gothard, which would come out all right.\" The _personnel_\r\nof the enterprise were not the only ones, however, who were uneasy over\r\nthe constantly occurring difficulties in the way of the work, for the\r\ncompany itself and the Swiss Federal Council made known to Favre their\r\nfears that the execution of the work would be delayed. He, however,\r\ncalmed their fears, and exposed his projects to them, and the seances\r\nalways ended by a vote of confidence in the future of the undertaking.\r\nFavre certainly did not dissimulate the difficulties that he should have\r\nto conquer, but he execrated those who were timorous and always tried to\r\nput confidence into those who surrounded him. But, singular phenomenon,\r\nhe ended by deceiving himself and, at certain times, it would not have\r\nbeen easy to prove to him that the St. Gothard was not the most easy\r\nundertaking in the world. Those who have lived around him know the jokes\r\nthat he sometimes made at the expense of poor Gothard, which paid him\r\nback with interest, however, and did not allow itself to be pierced so\r\neasy after all.\r\n\r\nSuch confidence as existed in the first years, however, was not to exist\r\nfor ever. The tunnel advanced, the heading deepened, but at the price of\r\nwhat troubles, and especially of how many expenses! Day by day one could\r\nsoon count the probable deficit in the affair and the silent partners\r\nbegan to get a glimpse of the loss of the eight millions of securities\r\nthat had had to be deposited with the Swiss Federal Council. For Favre\r\npersonally the failure of the enterprise would have been ruin for his\r\nfortune was not so large as has been stated. To fears which Favre\r\npossessed more on account of the associates that he had engaged in the\r\nenterprise than for himself, came to join themselves those troubles with\r\nthe Germans that he had spoken to me about on the first day. The St.\r\nGothard Company, whose troubles are so celebrated, and whose inactivity\r\nlasted until the reconstruction of the affair, was seemingly undertaking\r\nto make Favre, who was directing the only work then in activity, bear\r\nall the insults that it had itself had to endure. And yet, amid these\r\nmultiple cares, the contractor of the tunnel did not allow himself to\r\nbecome disheartened. Constantly at the breach he lived at his works,\r\ngoing from the gigantic adit of Goschenen to the inundated one of Anolo,\r\nconstantly on the mountain, having no heed of the icy and perilous\r\ncrossing, and passing days in the torrential rain that was flooding the\r\ntunnel. Who of us does not picture him in mind as he reached the inn at\r\nnight, with his high boots still soaking wet, and his gray beard full of\r\nicicles to take his accustomed seat at the table, and, between courses,\r\nto tell some story full of mirth, some joke from the other works whence\r\nhe had come, which made us laugh immoderately, and brought a smile to\r\nthe faces of the German engineers.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular coincidence that this confidence in his own work,\r\ndespite all the struggles borne, was shared likewise by another man than\r\nFavre--by Germano Sommeiller, the creator of the Mont Cenis Tunnel. When\r\nthe work of the first piercing of the Alps was yet in the period of\r\nattacks and incredulity, Sommeiller wrote his brother the following\r\nletter: \"Always keep me posted my dear Leander, as to what the laughers\r\nare saying and remember the proverb that 'he will laugh well who laughs\r\nlast!' The majority of the people, even engineers, are rubbing their\r\nhands in expectation of the colossal fiasco that awaits us, and it is\r\nfor that that the envious keep somewhat silent. I will predict to you\r\nthat as soon as success is assured everybody will mount to the house\r\ntops and say 'I told you so! It was an idea of my own!' What great\r\ngeniuses are going to spring from the earth! I am in haste, so adieu,\r\ncourage, energy, silence and especially cheerfulness! And especially\r\ncheerfulness!\" Perhaps this cheerfulness of strong minds is the\r\ninvincible weapon of those who, like Sommeiller and Favre, fight against\r\napathy or the bad faith of their adversaries! Like Favre however\r\nSommeiller had not the pleasure of being present at the consecration of\r\nhis glory, for at the Mont Cenis banquet as at the St. Gothard the place\r\nreserved for the creator of the great work was empty.\r\n\r\nAs disastrous as was the enterprise from a financial point of view what\r\na triumph for Favre would have been the day on which he traversed from\r\none end to the other that 15 kilometers of tunnel that he had walked\r\nover step by step since the first blow of the pick had struck the rock\r\nof the St. Gothard! But such a satisfaction was not to be reserved for\r\nhim. Suddenly, on the 19th of July, 1879, less than seven years after\r\nthe beginning of the work, and six months before the meeting of the\r\nadits, in the course of one of his visits to the tunnel Favre was\r\ncarried off by the rupture of a blood vessel. A year before that epoch,\r\nI had left the enterprise, Favre having confided to me the general\r\nsupervision over the manufacture of dynamite that he had undertaken at\r\nVarallo Pombia for the needs of his tunnel, but my friend M. Stockalper,\r\nengineer in chief of the Goschenen section, who accompanied Favre on his\r\nfatal subterranean excursion, has many a time recounted to me the sad\r\ndetails of his sudden death.\r\n\r\nFor months before it must be said Favre had been growing old. The man of\r\nbroad shoulders and with head covered with thick hair in which here and\r\nthere a few silver threads showed themselves, and who was as straight as\r\nat the age of twenty years, had begun to stoop, his hair had whitened\r\nand his face had assumed an expression of sadness that it was difficult\r\nfor him to conceal. As powerful as it was this character had been\r\nsubjugated. The transformation had not escaped me. Often during the days\r\nthat we passed together he complained of a dizziness that became more\r\nand more frequent. We all saw him rapidly growing old. On the 19th of\r\nJuly, 1879, he had entered the tunnel with one of his friends, a French\r\nengineer who had come to visit the work, accompanied by M. Stockalper.\r\nUp to the end of the adit he had complained of nothing, but, according\r\nto his habit, went along examining the timbers, stopping at different\r\npoints to give instructions, and making now and then a sally at his\r\nfriend, who was unused to the smell of dynamite. In returning he began\r\nto complain of internal pains. \"My dear Stockalper,\" said he, \"take my\r\nlamp, I will join you.\" At the end of ten minutes not seeing him return,\r\nM. Stockalper exclaimed, \"Well! M. Favre, are you coming?\" No answer.\r\nThe visitor and engineer retraced their steps, and when they reached\r\nFavre he was leaning against the rocks with his head resting upon his\r\nbreast. His heart had already ceased to beat. A train loaded with\r\nexcavated rock was passing and on this was laid the already stiff body\r\nof him who had struggled up to his last breath to execute a work all\r\nscience and labor. A glorious end, if ever there was one!\r\n\r\nFavre died in the full plenitude of his forces at less than fifty four\r\nyears of age, and I can say, without fear of contradiction, that he was\r\nuniversally and sincerely regretted by all those who had worked at his\r\nside. Still at the present time when a few of us old colleagues of\r\nGoschenen, Airolo or Altorf meet, it is not without emotion that we\r\nrecall the old days, the joyful reunions at which he cheered the whole\r\ntable with his broad and genial laugh.--_Maxime Helene, in La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW HARBOR OF VERA CRUZ.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the enormous engineering work of rendering navigable one of the\r\nmouths of the Mississippi Delta, and the continuous labor of developing\r\nthe more original and still bolder project for an Isthmian ship railway,\r\nMr. James B. Eads has been engaged in the design of new and extensive\r\nharbor works at Vera Cruz, which, when completed, will secure for that\r\ncity a commodious and secure port. The accompanying plan shows the\r\nnatural features of the locality, as well as the new works. The harbor\r\nis formed by the coast line from the Punta de la Caleta to the Punta de\r\nHornos, and by La Gallega reef. From the first named point a coral reef,\r\nnearly dry at low water, extends out about 300 yards into the gulf, and\r\na similar one of about the same length runs out from the Punta de\r\nHornos. Between these is a bay 2,000 meters wide, and at its northwest\r\nend lies the city of Vera Cruz. The bay is partly inclosed by an island\r\nor reef--La Gallega--which, on the harbor front, has a length of 1,200\r\nmeters. Beyond this, and to the southeast, is another small island--the\r\nLavendera reef. Between the end of this reef and that projecting from\r\nthe Punta de Hornos is 320 meters wide. As will be seen from the plan\r\nthe natural harbor is exposed to the gale from the north and northwest,\r\nwhile the formation affords general protection from the northeast and\r\nsoutheast thanks to five large coral reefs. Not unfrequently, however,\r\nheavy seas sweep through the wide channels between these small islands\r\ninterfering seriously with vessels lying alongside the present limited\r\nwharfage. Northeast, La Gallega and Gallaguilla reefs run northward from\r\nthe harbor for 3,300 meters and these with the main coast line, form a\r\nbay exposed to the full fury of the winds from the north, and when\r\nnorthern winds prevail rough water is driven through the passage between\r\nLa Gallega and Caleta reefs with great violence, and sets up a rapid and\r\ndangerous current into the harbor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW HARBOR AT VERA CRUZ.]\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it will be seen that, while presenting some\r\nadvantages, the natural harbor of Vera Cruz possesses many drawbacks and\r\ndangers which the design of Mr. Eads will completely remove. The leading\r\nfeatures of the works about to be carried out are indicated on the plan.\r\nThey comprise\r\n\r\n1. The construction of a sea wall between La Gallega and the Lavendera\r\nreefs, with an extension over the latter.\r\n\r\n2. The construction of a sea wall from Punta de la Caleta to La Gallega.\r\nThis part of the work will be begun after the completion of the first\r\nwall to a height of at least 3 ft. above low water.\r\n\r\n3. A dike connecting the northern ends of the first two dikes with each\r\nother, and stretching across the southern part of La Gallega, to prevent\r\nthe seas which sometimes break over this reef from entering the harbor.\r\nThe wall between La Gallega and Lavendera will not only cut off the\r\nrough water during northerly gales, but will also effectually prevent\r\nthe deposition of sand in the harbor, because the through passage to the\r\nnorthwest will be stopped. Passages closed by sluice gates will be\r\nformed through this wall at about low water level, so that at any time\r\nthe harbor may be flushed out and stagnation prevented.\r\n\r\n4. After the construction of the inclosing walls the harbor will be\r\ndredged out and cleared of coral to a depth of 25 ft. below low water.\r\n\r\n5. Following these works of primary importance comes the construction of\r\na wooden roadway from the Hornos reef to the northwestern dike. This\r\nroadway will form the south front of the harbor, and the excavated\r\nmaterial will be deposited on the space between the roadway and the\r\nexisting bottom, so as ultimately to make it a permanent work with a\r\nmasonry retaining wall fronting the harbor. The land between the roadway\r\nand the city would also be reclaimed to the extent of more than 740,000\r\nsquare yards.\r\n\r\n6. The construction of wooden piers at right angles to the roadway,\r\nwhich would be extended to run around the harbor as trade required it,\r\nfor ships to be alongside for loading and unloading. The construction of\r\nthese short piers would be similar to those used in New York and other\r\nUnited States ports, and they might afterward be replaced by masonry if\r\nthe increase in trade justified so large an expenditure.\r\n\r\n7. The erection of a lighthouse, at or near the eastern end of the\r\nLavendera sea wall of a second on the eastern side of La Gallaguilla\r\nreef, and of another on the west side of La Blanquilla reef. These\r\nhouses will be furnished with distinctive signals to enable steamers\r\nrunning in before another to run with safety between La Gallaguilla and\r\nLa Blanquilla as soon as the Lavendera light is seen between the other\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nThe width of deep water at the entrance between the Lavendera and Hornos\r\nreefs will be 1,000 ft. The estimated cost of these extensive works is\r\nten millions of dollars, a large sum for the Mexican Republic to expend\r\nin harbor improvements at one port but it will doubtless be found a\r\nprofitable investment as it will tend greatly to promote trade, and so\r\nincrease indefinitely the commerce of the port.\r\n\r\nMr. Eads' plan having been approved by the Mexican Government the work\r\nwas formally commenced on the 14th of last August. Plans were also\r\nfurnished by him at the request of the Government, for deepening the\r\nmouth of the Panuco River upon which is located the city of Tampico, the\r\nGulf terminus of the Mexican central railway system.--_Engineering._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST OF POWER TO MAKE FLOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following estimate of the cost of the power required to manufacture\r\na barrel of flour is taken from the _Miller_. The calculation would\r\nhardly hold good in this country owing to difference in cost of fuel\r\nattendance etc., but is nevertheless of interest.\r\n\r\n\"The cost of a steam motor per 20 stone (280 lb.) sack of flour depends\r\nentirely on local circumstances. It depends first, on the amount of\r\npower expended in the production of a sack of flour, that is on its mode\r\nof manufacture, and it depends, secondly, on the cost of the necessary\r\namount of power, that is, on the cost of fuel burned per horse power The\r\naverage consumption of coal of first class steam engines may be taken at\r\n2 lb. per hour per indicated horse power.\r\n\r\n\"Supposing a mill with six pairs of stones, two pairs of porcelain\r\nroller mills, and the necessary dressing, purifying, and wheat cleaning\r\nmachinery to require a steam motor of 100 indicated horse power to drive\r\nit, then the average consumption of fuel in this mill would be 200 lb.\r\nof coal per hour. Such a mill working day and night will turn out about\r\n400 sacks of flour per week of, say, 130 hours, so that 200 X 13 =\r\n26,000 lb. of coal would be required to manufacture 400 sacks of flour.\r\nThe cost of this quantity of coal may be taken at, say, L12 (about\r\n$58.32), and for cost of attending engine and boiler, cost of oil, etc.,\r\nanother L3 (about $14.58) per week may be added; so that, in this case,\r\nthe manufacture of 400 sacks of flour would cause an expenditure of L15\r\n($72.90) for the steam motor. Therefore the cost of the steam motor per\r\n20-stone sack of flour may be taken at 9d. (about 18 cents) per sack, if\r\nan improved low grinding system is used.\r\n\r\n\"In this case it is supposed that about 55 per cent. of flour is\r\nobtained in the first run, leaving about 30 per cent. of middlings and\r\nabout 12 per cent. of bran, which is finished in a bran duster. The\r\nmiddlings are purified, ground over one pair of middling stones, then\r\ndressed through a centrifugal and the tailings of the latter are passed\r\nover one of the porcelain roller mills, whereas the other porcelain\r\nroller mill treats the second quality of middlings coming from the\r\npurifier. The products from the two porcelain roller mills are dressed\r\nthrough a second centrifugal, and the whole flour is mixed into one\r\nstraight grade. Four pairs of stones are supposed to work on wheat, one\r\non middlings, and one pair is sharpening. The first run is supposed to\r\nbe dressed through two long silk reels. Of course, not every steam motor\r\nhas so low a consumption of coal as two pounds per hour per horse power;\r\nit often amounts to three, four, and five pounds per hour. In that case,\r\nof course, the cost of steam power per sack is much greater than 9d. per\r\nsack. A greater number of breaks does not necessarily increase the cost\r\nof steam power per sack of flour. Although more machines may be\r\nemployed, each of them may require less horse power; so that the total\r\namount of power required for manufacturing an equal amount of flour may\r\nnot be greater in the case of gradual reduction.\r\n\r\n\"As, however, the cost of maintenance may be slightly greater in the\r\nlatter case, on account of a greater number of more elaborate machines,\r\nthe cost of manufacturing a sack of flour may be a little greater when\r\ngradual reduction is employed, taking into account the total expenses of\r\nthe mill and interest on the capital employed.\r\n\r\n\"Water motors are generally a much cheaper source of energy than steam\r\nmotors, but they are not so reliable and constant as the latter. The\r\nvery irregular supply of water sometimes causes stoppages of the mill,\r\nand often a reserve steam engine has to be provided in order to assist\r\nthe water motor when the quantity of water decreases during the summer\r\nmonths. Wind motors were formerly extensively used for milling purposes,\r\nbut they are now gradually disappearing. They are too irregular and\r\nunreliable, although they utilize a very cheap motive power. It is not\r\nadvantageous to expend a large amount of capital for a mill which often\r\nis unable to work at the very time when there are favorable\r\nopportunities for doing profitable business. Animal motors are too dear.\r\nThey are only suitable for driving very small mills in out of the way\r\nlocalities.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRIVING GEAR MECHANISM FOR LIFT HAMMERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very interesting system of driving gear for lift hammers was applied\r\nin an apparatus exhibited at Frankfort in 1881 by Mr. Meier of Herzen.\r\nThe arrangement of the mechanism is shown in Figs. 1 and 2. In the upper\r\npart of the hammer-frame there is a shaft which is possessed of a\r\ncontinuous rotary motion, and, with it, there is connected by a friction\r\ncoupling a drum that receives the belt from which is suspended the\r\nhammer. In the apparatus exhibited, the mechanism is so arranged that\r\nthe hammer must always follow the motion of the controlling lever in the\r\nsame direction; but a system may likewise be adopted such that the\r\nhammer shall continue to operate automatically, when and so long as a\r\nlever prepared for such purpose is lowered.\r\n\r\n_ab_ is the shaft having a continuous rotary motion, and upon which are\r\nfixed the pulley, c, the fly-wheel, d, and the friction-disk, e.\r\nUpon one of the extremities of the driving shaft is fixed an elongated\r\nsleeve, formed of the drum, g, and of the screw, f, carried by the\r\nnut, h. This latter is supported in the frame in such a way that it\r\ncannot turn, but can move easily in the direction of the axis. Such\r\nmotion may be produced by the spring, i, and its extent is such that\r\nthe drum, g, is brought in contact with the friction-disk, e.\r\n\r\nThe hand-lever, k, rod, l, and bent lever, m, serve to bring about\r\na motion in the opposite direction, and which disengages the drum, g,\r\nfrom the disk, e, and lets the hammer fall; the drum being then able\r\nto turn freely. If the lever, k, be afterward raised again, the\r\nspring, i, will act anew and couple the drum with the driving-shaft,\r\nso that the hammer will be lifted. In this rotary motion the screw, f,\r\nturns or re-enters into its nut, which it displaces toward the left,\r\nsince it cannot itself move in that direction until the rectilinear\r\nmotion be wiped out, and the power of the spring be thus overcome. At\r\nthe same moment, the screw should naturally also make this rectilinear\r\nmovement forward, that is to say, the coupling would be disengaged, if,\r\nat the least lateral motion toward the right, the spring, i, did not\r\npush the system toward the left. There is thus produced a state of\r\nequilibrium such that there is just enough friction between the disk,\r\ne, and the drum, g, to keep the hammer at rest and suspended.\r\nThrough the action of an external force which lowers the lever, K, the\r\nhammer at once falls, and the screw issues anew from its nut and brings\r\nthe parts into their former positions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEIER'S DRIVING GEAR MECHANISM FOR LIFT HAMMERS.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDE JUNKER & RUH'S MACHINE FOR CUTTING ANNULAR WHEELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe machine shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 3 has been devised by Messrs.\r\nJunker & Ruh, of Carlsruhe, for cutting internally-toothed gear-wheels.\r\nThe progress of the work is such that the wheel is pushed toward the\r\ntool by a piece, n, provided with a curve guide, and that the tool is\r\nraised and separated from the wheel after a tooth has been cut, in order\r\nto allow the wheel to revolve one division further.\r\n\r\nThe tool is placed in a support, b, which is fixed to the upright,\r\nd, in such away that it may revolve; and this support is connected to\r\nthe frame, a, of the machine. A strong flat spring, f, constantly\r\npresses the tool-carrier, b, toward the upright, d, as much as the\r\nscrew, g, will permit; and this pressure and the tension of the belt\r\ndraw the tool downward. The screws, g, determine the depth of the cut,\r\nand compensate for the differences in the diameter of the tool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACHINE FOR CUTTING ANNULAR WHEELS.]\r\n\r\nThe wheels to be cut are set by pressure into a wrought iron ring, with\r\nwhich they are placed in a sleeve or support, h. The connection\r\nbetween the two is assured by means of a nut, c. The axle of the\r\nsupport, h, is held in the upright of the carriage, k, which\r\nreceives from a piece, l, placed on the driving-shaft, n, a slow\r\nforward motion toward the tool, and a rapid motion backward. The\r\ntrajectory curve or groove of special form of the piece, l, in which\r\nmoves the conducting roller, o, of the carriage, is not closed\r\neverywhere on the two sides, in that the guides that limit it extend\r\nonly on the part strictly necessary. This arrangement permits of the\r\nroller being made to leave the trajectory in order that the carriage may\r\nbe drawn back to a sufficient distance from the tool when the wheel is\r\nfinished, so as to replace the latter by another.\r\n\r\nOne hollow is cut during each forward travel of the carriage; and, when\r\nsuch travel is finished, a cam-disk, p, placed on the shaft, n,\r\nlifts the tool-carrier, b, and thus draws the cutting-tool out of the\r\nhollow cut by it, so that the carriage cam can then move back without\r\nrestraint. In the interim, the sleeve, h, which supports the wheel,\r\nrevolves one tooth through the following arrangement: On the axis, e,\r\nof this sleeve there are two ratchet-wheels, r and s, the number of\r\nwhose teeth is equal to that of the teeth to be cut in the wheel. The\r\nwheel, r, produces the rotation of the sleeve, h, and the wheel,\r\ns, keeps the shaft stationary during the operation. The two wheels are\r\nset in motion by a lever, t, or by its click, this lever being raised\r\nat the desired moment on the free extremity of the driving shaft, n,\r\nby a wedge, u. The short arm of the lever, t, engages, through its\r\npoint of appropriate shape, with the teeth of the wheel, s, so as to\r\nkeep this latter stationary while the tool is cutting out the interspace\r\nbetween the teeth. When the lever, t, is raised, this point is at\r\nfirst disengaged from the wheel, s; and the raising of the lever being\r\nprolonged, the button, i, places itself against the upper curve of the\r\nslot in the lever, q, and raises that likewise. q is connected with\r\nthe lever, v, which revolves about the axis, e, and v carries the\r\nclick, w, so that when the lever, v, is raised, the wheel, r,\r\nturns forward by one tooth. When the lever, t, is lowered, as the\r\nwedge, u, turns more, its click holds the wheel, s, stationary. This\r\nseries of operations is repeated until the last interspace between the\r\nteeth has been cut, when the machine stops automatically as follows: A\r\ncam of the disk, A, which receives from the shaft, n, through\r\ncone-wheels, a motion corresponding to that of the wheels, r and s,\r\nabuts against the two-armed lever, z, and this latter then disengages\r\nthe rod, y, so that the weight, G, can move the fork, B, in such a way\r\nthat the belt shall pass from the fast to the loose pulley.\r\n\r\nMotion is communicated to the machine as a whole by the shaft, C, which\r\nis provided with a fast and loose pulley. As shown in the engraving, the\r\npulley, D, moves the tool, and the pulley, E, causes the revolution of\r\nthe shaft, n, through a helicoidal gearing, F.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the tool carrier is represented in detail in Fig. 3.\r\nThe cutting tool, F, rests on a sleeve forming part of the pulley,\r\nr1, against which it is pressed by a nut, while its position is\r\nfixed by a key. The axle, s1, of the tool is held in two boxes, in\r\nwhich it is fixed by screws. In order that the tool may be placed\r\nexactly in the axis of the wheel to be toothed, and that also the play\r\nproduced by lateral wear of the pulley, r1, may be compensated for,\r\ntwo screws, r2, are arranged on the sides. All rotation of the\r\nshaft, s1, is prevented by a screw, o, which traverses the cast\r\niron stirrup, C, and the steel axle box.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT HYDRAULIC EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a late meeting of the Institution of Civil Engineers, the paper read\r\nwas on \"Recent Hydraulic Experiments,\" by Major Allan Cunningham, R.E.\r\n\r\nThis paper was mainly a general account of some extensive experiments on\r\nthe flow of water in the Ganges Canal, lasting over four years--1874-79.\r\nTheir principal object was to find a good mode of discharge measurements\r\nfor large canals, and to test existing formulae. There are about 50,000\r\nvelocity, and 600 surface-slope measurements, besides many special\r\nexperiments. The Ganges Canal, from its great size, from the variety of\r\nits branches abounding in long straight reaches, and from the power of\r\ncontrol over the water in it, was eminently suited for such experiments.\r\nAn important feature was the great range of conditions, and, therefore,\r\nalso of results obtained. Thus the chief work was done at thirteen sites\r\nin brickwork and in earth, some being rectangular and others\r\ntrapezoidal, and varying from 193 ft. to 13 ft. in breadth, and from 11\r\nft. to 7 in. in depth, with surface-slopes from 480 to 24 per million,\r\nvelocities from 7.7 ft. to 0.6 ft. per second, and discharges from 7,364\r\nto 114 cubic feet per second. For all systematic velocity measurements,\r\nfloats were exclusively used, viz., surface floats, double floats, and\r\nloaded rods. Their advantages and disadvantages had been fully discussed\r\nin the detailed treatise \"Roorkee Hydraulic Experiments\"--1881. They\r\nmeasured only \"forward velocity,\" the practically useful part of the\r\nactual velocity. The motion of water, even when tranquil to the eye, was\r\nfound to be technically \"unsteady;\" it was inferred that there is no\r\ndefinite velocity at any point, and that the velocity varies everywhere\r\nlargely, both in direction and in magnitude. The average of, say, fifty\r\nforward velocity measurements at any one point was pretty constant, so\r\nthat there must be probably average steady motion. Hence average forward\r\nvelocity measurements would be the only ones of much practical use. To\r\nobtain these would be tedious and costly, and special arrangements would\r\nbe required to obviate the effects of a change in the state of water,\r\nwhich often occurred in a long experiment, as when velocities at many\r\npoints were wanted.\r\n\r\nAs to surface-slope its measurement--from nearly 600 trials--was found\r\nto be such a delicate operation that the result would be of doubtful\r\nutility. This would affect the application of all formulas into which it\r\nentered. The water surface was ascertained, on the average of its\r\noscillations, to be sensibly level across, not convex, as supposed by\r\nsome writers. There were 565 sets of vertical velocity measurements\r\ncombined into forty-six series. The forty-six average curves were all\r\nvery flat and convex down stream--except near an irregular bank--and\r\nwere approximately parabolas with horizontal axes; the data determined\r\nthe parameters only very roughly; the maximum velocity line was usually\r\nbelow the service, and sank in a rectangular channel, from the center\r\noutward down to about mid-depth near the banks. Its depression seemed\r\nnot to depend on the depth, slope, velocity, or wind; probably the air\r\nitself, being a continuous source of surface retardation, would\r\npermanently depress the maximum velocity, while wind failed to effect\r\nthis, owing to its short duration. On any vertical the mid-depth\r\nvelocity was greater than the mean, and the bed velocity was the least.\r\nThe details showed that the mid-depth velocity was nearly as variable\r\nfrom instant to instant as any other, instead of being nearly constant,\r\nas suggested by the Mississippi experimenters.\r\n\r\nThe measurement of the mean velocity past a vertical was thought to be\r\nof fundamental importance. Loaded rods seemed by far the best for both\r\naccuracy and convenience in depths under 15 ft. They should be immersed\r\nonly 0.94 of the full depth. The chief objection to their use,\r\nthat--from not dipping into the slack water near the bed--they moved too\r\nquickly, was thus for the first time removed. A double float with two\r\nsimilar sub-floats at depths of 0.211 and 0.789 of the full depth would\r\nalso give this mean with more accuracy and convenience than any\r\ninstrument of its class; this instrument is new. Measurement of the\r\nvelocity at five eighths depth would also afford a fair approximation.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and fourteen average transverse velocity curves were\r\nprepared from 714 separate curves. These average curves were all very\r\nflat, and were convex down stream--over a level or concave bed--and\r\nnearly symmetric in a symmetric section. The velocity was greatest near\r\nthe center, or deepest channel, decreased very slowly at first toward\r\nboth banks, more rapidly with approach to the banks or with shallowing\r\nof the depth, very rapidly close to the banks, and was very small at the\r\nedges, possibly zero. The figure of the curve was found to be determined\r\nby the figure of the bed, a convexity in the bed producing a concavity\r\nin the curve and _vice versa_, and more markedly in shallow than in deep\r\nwater. Curves on the same transversal, at the same site, and with\r\nsimilar conditions, but differing in general velocity, were nearly\r\nparallel projections. At the edges there was a strong transverse surface\r\nflow from the edge toward mid-channel, decreasing rapidly with distance\r\nfrom the edge. The discussion showed that it was almost hopeless to seek\r\nthe geometric figure of the curves from mere experiment.\r\n\r\nFive hundred and eighty-one cubic discharges were measured under very\r\nvaried conditions. The process adopted contained three steps: (1)\r\nSounding along about fifteen float courses, scattered across the site in\r\neight cross sections; time, say four hours. (2) Measurement of the mean\r\nvelocities through the full depths in those float courses, each thrice\r\nrepeated; time, say four hours. (3) Computation, say two hours. This\r\nprocess was direct and wholly experimental; each step was done in a time\r\nwhich gave some chance of a constant state of water. From an extended\r\ncomparison of all results under similar conditions, it appeared that the\r\nabove process yielded, under favorable circumstances, results not likely\r\nto differ more than 5 per cent. The sequel showed that in a channel with\r\nvariable regimen, a discharge table for a given site must be of at least\r\ndouble entry, as dependent on the local gauge-reading, and on the\r\nvelocity or surface-slope.\r\n\r\nSpecial attention was paid to rapid approximations to mean sectional\r\nvelocity. The mean velocity past the central vertical, the central\r\nsurface velocity, and Chezy's quasi-velocity--i.e.,\r\n\r\n  100 x Sqrt (R x S)\r\n\r\nwhere R = the hydraulic mean depth, and S = surface slope--were tried in\r\ndetail; thus 100, 76, and 83 average values thereof respectively were\r\ntaken from 581, 313, and 363 detail values. The ratios of these three\r\nvelocities to the mean velocity were taken out, and compared in detail\r\nwith Bazin's and Cutter's coefficients. Other formulae were contrasted\r\nalso in slight detail. Kutter's alone seemed to be of general\r\napplicability; when the surface slope measurement is good, and the\r\nrugosity coefficient known for the site--both doubtful matters--it would\r\nprobably give results within 71/2 per cent. of error. Improvement in\r\nformulae could at present be obtained only by increased complexity, and\r\nthe tentative research would be excessively laborious. Now the first two\r\nratios varied far less than the third; thus their use would probably\r\ninvolve less error than the third, or approximation would be more likely\r\nfrom direct velocity measurement than from any use of surface slope. The\r\nconnection between velocities was probably a closer one than between\r\nvelocity and slope; the former being perhaps only a geometric, and the\r\nlatter a physical one. The mean velocity past the central vertical was\r\nrecommended for use, as not being affected by wind; the reduction\r\ncoefficient could at present only be found by special experiment for\r\neach site. Three current meters were tried for some time with a special\r\nlift, contrived to grip the meter firmly parallel to the current axis,\r\nso as to register only forward velocity, and with a nearly rigid gearing\r\nwire. No useful general results were obtained. Ninety specimens of silt\r\nwere collected, but no connection could be traced between silt and\r\nvelocity; it seemed that the silt at any point varied greatly from\r\ninstant to instant, and that the quantity depended not on the mean\r\nvelocity, but probably on the silt in the supply water. Forty\r\nmeasurements of the evaporation from the canal surface were made in a\r\nfloating pan, during twenty five months. The average daily evaporation\r\nwas only about 1/10 in. The smallness of this result seemed to be due to\r\nthe coldness of the water--only 63 deg. in May, with 165 deg. in the sun\r\nand 105 deg. in shade. Lastly, it must suffice to say that great care\r\nwas taken to insure accuracy in both fieldwork and computation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERM.\r\n\r\nBy ARTHUR ATKINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere seems to have sprung up within a few mouths a tendency to revive\r\nthe discussion on that hackneyed question, \"Shall the germ be retained\r\nin the flour?\" This question has been more than once answered in the\r\nnegative by both scientific and practical men, but recently certain\r\nprominent persons have come to the conclusion that every one has been\r\nwrong on this point, and the miller should by all means retain the germ.\r\nNow the nutritive value of the germ cannot be disputed, but there are\r\ntwo circumstances which condemn it us an ingredient of flour. The first\r\nis that the albuminoids which it contains are largely soluble, and this\r\nmeans that good light bread from germy flour is impossible. I have not\r\ntime to go into a detailed explanation of the chemical reasons for this,\r\nbut they may be found in a series of articles which appeared in _The\r\nMilling World_ about a year ago. In the next place, the oil contained in\r\nthe germ not only discolors the flour, but seriously interferes with its\r\nkeeping qualities. Now color is only a matter of taste, and if that were\r\nthe only objection to the germ, it might be admitted, but we certainly\r\ndo not want anything in our flour to interfere with making light, sweet\r\nbread, and will render it more liable to spoil. If our scientists can\r\ndiscover some method of obviating these objections, it will then be time\r\nenough to talk about retaining the germ. Meanwhile millers know that\r\ngermy flour is low priced flour, and they are not very likely to reduce\r\ntheir profits by retaining the germ.--_Milling World._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEAT TESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was considerable complaint last season, on the part of wheat\r\nraisers in sections tributary to Minneapolis, on account of the rigid\r\nstandard of grading adopted by the millers of that city. It was asserted\r\nthat the differentiation of prices between the grades was unjustly great\r\nand out of proportion to the actual difference of value. In order to\r\nascertain whether this was the case or not, the Farmers' Association of\r\nBlue Earth County, Minn., decided to have samples of each grade analyzed\r\nby a competent chemist in order to determine their relative value.\r\nAccordingly specimens were secured, certified to by the agent of the\r\nMillers' Association of Minneapolis, and sent to the University of\r\nMinnesota for analysis. The analysis was conducted by Prof. Wm. A.\r\nNoyes, Ph.D., an experienced chemist, who has recently reported as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"The analyses of wheat given below were undertaken for the purpose of\r\ndetermining whether the millers' grades of wheat correspond to an actual\r\ndifference in the chemical character of the wheat. For this purpose\r\nsamples of wheat were secured, which were inspected and certified to by\r\nM. W. Trexa on April 13th of this year. The inspection cards contained\r\nno statement except the grade of the wheat and the weight per bushel,\r\nbut the samples were all of Fife, for the purpose of a better\r\ncomparison. The analyses of the wheat were made during October in this\r\nlaboratory. In each case the wheat was carefully separated from any\r\nforeign substances before analysis. The results of analysis were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                                        Grade     Grade       Grade\r\n                                        No. 1.    No. 2.

The only substances in which\r\nthere is evident connection between the results of analysis and the\r\ngrades of wheat are the cellulose, ash, and phosphorus. As regards the\r\nlast substance, grades two and three seem to have the greatest food\r\nvalue. But it seems quite probable from the results that greater\r\ndifference would be found between different varieties of wheat of the\r\nsame kind than is shown here between different grades of the same\r\nvariety of wheat. However, it does not necessarily follow from this that\r\nthe different grades of wheat are of nearly equal value to the miller\r\nfor the purpose of making flour. That is a question which can be best\r\nanswered by determining accurately the amount and character of the flour\r\nwhich can be made from each grade of wheat. If possible, the\r\ninvestigation will be continued in that direction.\"\r\n\r\nAs Prof. Noyes justly remarks, the value of the different grades of\r\nwheat can best be determined by a comparison of the results of reducing\r\nthem to flour, but an intelligent study of the table given above would\r\nof itself be sufficient to indicate the justness of the grading. In the\r\nfirst place, even were the percentages of the different components\r\nexactly the same in each grade, still the difference in weight would of\r\nitself be sufficient to justify a marked difference in price. This\r\nrequires no proof, for, other things being equal, fifty-nine pounds is\r\nworth more than fifty-five pounds. Again, the figures show that No. 3\r\ncontained nearly four times as much foreign matter as No. 1. Millers\r\ncertainly should not be expected to pay for foreign seeds or other\r\nsubstances valueless for their purpose, at the price of wheat. Finally,\r\nif the analysis proves anything, it proves that the lower grades contain\r\na decidedly larger percentage of components which it is generally\r\nagreed, whether directly or the reverse, ought not to be incorporated\r\nwith the flour, and are, therefore, of comparatively little value to the\r\nmiller. This is shown by the relative amounts of cellulose, ash, and\r\nphosphorus present. Cellulose, as every one knows, is the woody,\r\nindigestible substance which is found in the bran, and the greater the\r\namount of cellulose, the heavier will be the bran in proportion to the\r\nflour producing elements. According to the figures presented, No. 3\r\ncontained nearly one-quarter more cellulose than No. 1, while the amount\r\nin No. 2 was slightly less than in No. 3. The ash, too, which represents\r\nthe mineral constituents of the wheat, is directly dependent upon the\r\nquantity of bran. Here, too, the lowest grade is shown to yield about\r\none-quarter more than the highest. The larger percentage of phosphorus\r\nin the lower grades is suggested by the analyst to indicate their\r\ngreater food value in this respect. So it would, were we in the habit of\r\nboiling our wheat and heating it whole, or of using \"whole wheat meal.\"\r\nBut, fortunately or unfortunately, the bread reformers have not yet\r\nsucceeded in inoculating any considerable portion of the community with\r\ntheir doctrines, and hence the actual food value of any sample of wheat\r\nmust be ascertained, not directly from the composition of the wheat, but\r\nfrom the composition of the flour made therefrom. Now, as already\r\nstated, phosphorus, like the other mineral components, is found almost\r\nentirely in the bran. Its presence in greater quantity, therefore,\r\nsimply adds to the testimony that a larger proportion of the low grade\r\nwheat must be rejected than of the higher grade. It should be evident to\r\nthe complaining farmers that the millers were in the right of the\r\nquestion, on this occasion at least.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that further analysis will be made, this time of the\r\nflour made from the different grades of wheat. If these investigations\r\nbe properly conducted, we have no doubt that they will simply confirm\r\nthe evidence of the wheat tests. A chemical analysis alone, however,\r\nwill not be sufficient. The quantity of flour obtained from a given\r\namount of wheat must also be ascertained and its quality further tested\r\nby means best known to millers, as regards \"doughing-up,\" keeping\r\nqualities, color, etc. And then the result can be no less than to show\r\nwhat millers already knew--that the best quality of flour, commanding\r\nthe top prices in the market, cannot be obtained from an inferior\r\nquality of wheat.--_Milling World._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR PRINTING BY THE BLUE PROCESS.[1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Read June 21, 1882, before the Boston Society of\r\n    Civil Engineers.]\r\n\r\nBy CHANNING WHITAKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe blue process is well known to the members of the society, and I need\r\nnot take time to describe it; but with the ordinary blue process\r\nprinting frame the results are sometimes unsatisfactory, and now that\r\nthe process has come to be so commonly used I have thought that an\r\naccount of an inexpensive but efficient printing frame would be of\r\ninterest. The essential parts of the apparatus are its frame, its glass,\r\nits pad or cushion, its clamps, and the mechanism by which the surface\r\nof the glass can easily be made to take a position that is square with\r\nthe direction of the sun's rays.\r\n\r\n_The Blue Process Printing Frame in Common Use.--Its Defects._--The pad\r\nof the apparatus in common use consists of several thicknesses of\r\nblanketing stretched upon a back board. The sensitized paper and the\r\nnegative are placed between the pad and the plate glass, and the whole\r\nis squeezed together by pressure applied at the periphery of the glass\r\nand of the back-board. Both the glass and the back-board spring under\r\nthe pressure, and it results that the sensitized paper is not so\r\nseverely pressed against the negative near the center of the glass as it\r\nis near the edges. If at any point the sensitized paper is not pressed\r\nhard up against the negative, a bluish tinge will appear where a white\r\nline or surface was expected. With an efficient printing frame and\r\nsuitable negatives, these blue lines will never appear, and it was to\r\nprevent the production of defective work that I undertook to improve the\r\npad of the printing frame.\r\n\r\n_The Printing Frame Used in Ordinary Photography._--Very naturally, I\r\nfirst examined the printing frame used in ordinary photography. This\r\nframe is extremely simple, and is very well adapted to its use. It is,\r\nundoubtedly, the best frame for blue process printing, when the area of\r\nthe glass is not too large. The glass is set in an ordinary wooden\r\nframe, while the back-board is stiff and divided into two parts. A flat,\r\nbow-shaped spring is attached by a pivot to the center of each half of\r\nthe back-board. The two halves of the back-board are hinged together by\r\nordinary butts. Four lugs are fastened to the back of the frame, and,\r\nwhen the back-board is placed in position, the springs may be swung\r\naround, parallel to the line of the hinges, and pressed under the lugs,\r\nso that the back of the back-board is pressed most severely at the\r\ncenter of each half, while the glass is prevented from springing away\r\nfrom the back-board by the resistance of the frame at its edges. Unless\r\nthe frame is remarkably stiff, it will resist the springing of the glass\r\nmore perfectly in the neighborhood of the lugs than elsewhere. It will\r\nnow be seen that, on account of the manner in which the pressure is\r\napplied, the back-board tends to become convex toward the glass, while\r\nthe adjacent surface of the glass tends to become concave toward the\r\nback-board; and that with such a frame, the pressure upon all parts of\r\nthe sensitized paper is more nearly uniform than when the pressure is\r\napplied in the manner before described. With a small frame of this\r\ndescription, a piece of ordinary cotton flannel is used between the\r\nback-board and the sensitized paper, and, with larger sizes, one or more\r\nthicknesses of elastic woolen blanket are substituted for the cotton\r\nflannel. There is an advantage in having a hinged back-board like that\r\nwhich has been described, because, when the operator thinks that the\r\nexposure to sunlight has been sufficiently prolonged, he can turn down\r\neither half of the back and examine the sensitized paper, to see if the\r\nprocess has been carried far enough. If it has not, the back-board can\r\nbe replaced, and the exposure continued, without any displacement of the\r\nsensitized paper with respect to the negative. This is an important\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n_An Efficient Blue Process Frame, for Printing from Large Negatives, or\r\nfor Printing Simultaneously from many Small Ones._--In order to be\r\nefficient, such a frame must be capable of keeping the sensitized paper\r\n_everywhere tightly pressed against the negative_. Again, such a frame,\r\nbeing large, is necessarily somewhat heavy. It should be so mounted that\r\nit can be handled with ease; and, in order that it may print quickly, it\r\nshould be so arranged that it can be turned without delay, at any time,\r\ninto a position that is square with the direction of the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, if a sufficiently thick plate of glass should be used, the\r\nordinary photographic printing frames would answer the purpose, whatever\r\nthe size, but very thick plate glass is both heavy and expensive.\r\nCommercial plate glass varies in thickness from one-fourth to three\r\neighths of an inch, and the thicker plates are rather rare. A large\r\nplate of it is easily broken by a slight uniformly distributed pressure.\r\nBut the pressure that is required for the blue process printing,\r\nalthough slight, is much greater than is used in the ordinary\r\nphotographic process. For the sensitized paper that is used in the blue\r\nprocess printing is, comparatively, very thick and stiff, and it may\r\ncockle more or less, while the paper that is used in ordinary\r\nphotography is thin and does not cockle. Now, it is easy to see that a\r\npressure severe enough to flatten all cockles must be had at every part\r\nof the sensitized paper, and that, if the comparatively thin,\r\ninexpensive, light weight, commercial plate glass is to be used, it is\r\ndesirable to have the pressure _nowhere much greater than is needed for\r\nthat purpose_, lest the fragile glass should be fractured by it. In each\r\nof my large frames I use the commercial plate glass; instead of the\r\ncushion of cotton flannel, or of flannel, I use a cushion filled with\r\nair of sufficiently high pressure to flatten all cockles, and to press\r\nall parts of the sensitized paper closely against the negative; and\r\ninstead of the hinged back-board I use a back-board made in one piece\r\nand clamped to the frame of the glass at its edges. Connected with the\r\ncushion is a pressure gauge, and a tube with a cock, for charging the\r\ncushion with air from the lungs. Experience shows what pressure is\r\nnecessary with any given paper, and the gauge enables one to know that\r\nthe pressure is neither deficient nor in excess of that which is safe\r\nfor the glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN. COTTON FLANNEL REMOVED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION AT CO.]\r\n\r\n_The Construction of the Air-Cushion._--The expense of such an\r\nair-cushion seemed at first likely to prevent its being used; but a\r\nmethod of construction suggested itself, the expense of which proved to\r\nbe very slight. The wooden back-board, as constructed, is made in one\r\npiece containing no wide cracks. It has laid upon it some thick brown\r\nManila paper, the upper surface of which has been previously shellacked\r\nto make it entirely air-tight. Upon this shellacked surface is laid a\r\nsingle thickness of thin paper of any kind; even newspaper will answer.\r\nIts object is simply to prevent the sheet rubber, which forms the top of\r\nthe air-cushion, from sticking to the shellacked paper. The heat of the\r\nsun is often sufficient to bring the shellac to a sticky state. It would\r\nprobably answer as well to shellac the under side of the paper, and to\r\nuse but one sheet, but I have not tried this plan. Around the periphery\r\nof the pad, there is laid a piece of rubber gasket about one and a half\r\ninches wide, and about one-eighth of an inch thick. In order that the\r\ngasket may not be too expensive, it is cut from two strips about three\r\ninches wide. One of them is as long as the outside length of the frame,\r\nand the other is as long as the outside width of the frame. Each of\r\nthese strips is cut into two L-shaped pieces, an inch and a half in\r\nwidth, with the shorter leg of each L three inches long. When the four\r\npieces are put together a scarf joint is made near each corner, having\r\nan inch and one-half lap. It is somewhat difficult to cut such a scarf\r\njoint as perfectly as one would wish, and it is best to use rubber\r\ncement at the joints. Over the gasket is laid a sheet of the thinnest\r\ngrade of what is called pure rubber or elastic gum. Above this, and over\r\nthe gasket, is placed a single thickness of cotton cloth, of the same\r\ndimensions as the gasket, and yet above this are strips of ordinary\r\nstrap iron, an inch and a half wide and nearly one eighth of an inch\r\nthick. These strips are filed square at the ends and butt against each\r\nother at right angles. As the edges of the strips are slightly rounded,\r\nthey are filed away sufficiently to form good joints wherever the others\r\nbutt against them. The whole combination is bound together by ordinary\r\nstove bolts, one quarter of an inch in diameter, placed near the center\r\nof the width of the iron strips, and at a distance apart of about two\r\nand one-half inches. Their heads are countersunk into the strap iron. In\r\nmaking the holes for the stove bolts through the thin rubber, care\r\nshould be taken to make them sufficiently large to enable the bolt to\r\npass through without touching the rubber, otherwise the rubber may cling\r\nto the bolts, and if they are turned in their holes the rubber may be\r\ntorn near the bolts and made to leak. A rough washer, under each nut,\r\nprevents it from cutting into the back-board. For the purpose of\r\nintroducing air to, or removing air from, the pad, a three-eighths of an\r\ninch lock nut nipple is introduced through the back-board, the\r\nshellacked paper, and its thin paper covering. Without the back-board a\r\nT connects with the nipple. One of its branches leads, by a rubber tube,\r\nto the pressure gauge, which is a U-tube of glass containing mercury.\r\nThe other branch has upon it an ordinary plug cock, and, beyond this, a\r\nrubber tube terminating in a glass mouth-piece. When it is desired to\r\ninflate the air-cushion, it is only necessary to blow into the\r\nmouth-piece. A pressure of one inch of mercury is sufficient for any\r\nwork that I have yet undertaken. With particularly good paper, a lower\r\npressure is sufficient. Upon the top of the pad is laid a piece of\r\ncommon cotton flannel with the nap outward, and with its edges tacked\r\nalong the under edge of the back-board. The cotton flannel is not drawn\r\ntight across the top of the pad. The reason for employing a cotton\r\nflannel covering is this: When the sheet rubber has been exposed for a\r\nfew days to the strong sunlight, it loses its strength and becomes\r\nworthless. The cotton flannel is a protection against the destruction of\r\nthe rubber by the sunlight. I first observed this destruction while\r\nexperimenting with a cheap and convenient form of gauge. I used, as an\r\ninexpensive gauge, an ordinary toy balloon, and I could tell, with\r\nsufficient accuracy, how much pressure I had applied, by the swelling of\r\nthe balloon. This balloon ruptured from some unknown cause, and I made a\r\nsubstitute for it out of a round sheet of thin flat rubber, gathered all\r\naround the circumference. I made holes about one-quarter of an inch\r\napart, and passing a string in and out drew it tight upon the outside of\r\na piece of three eighths of an inch pipe, I then wound a string tightly\r\nover the rubber, on the pipe, and found the whole to be air-tight. This\r\nserved me for some time, but one day, on applying the pressure, I found\r\na hole in the balloon which looked as if it had been cut with a very\r\nsharp knife. That it had been so cut was not to be imagined, and on\r\nfurther examination I found that the fracture had occured at a line\r\nwhich separated a surface in the strong sunlight from a surface in the\r\nshade, at a fold in the rubber. I saw that all of the rubber which had\r\nbeen continuously exposed to the intense sunlight had changed color and\r\nhad become whiter than before, and that that portion of the balloon had\r\nlost its strength. I then returned to the use of the mercury gauge, and\r\ntook the precaution to cover my pad with cotton flannel, as a protection\r\nfrom the light and from other sources of destruction. This pad is upon\r\nthe roof of the Institute; and is exposed to all weathers. As a\r\nprotection from the rain and the snow, the whole is covered again with a\r\nrubber blanket. It has withstood the exposure perfectly well for a year,\r\nwithout injury. The gauge, made from flat rubber, is altogether so cheap\r\nand so convenient that I am now experimenting with one of this\r\ndescription having a black cloth covering upon the outside. The balloon\r\nis of spherical shape, the black cloth covering is of cylindrical shape,\r\nand I hope that this device will serve every necessary purpose. A\r\nsectional view of the air-cushion is offered as a part of this\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n_The Frame, which Contains the Plate Glass_, is made of thick board or\r\nplank, with the broad side of the board at right angles to the surface\r\nof the glass. A rabbet is made for the reception of the glass, and four\r\nstrips of strap iron, overlapping both the glass, and the wood, and\r\nscrewed to the wood, keep the glass in position. Strips of rubber are\r\ninterposed between the glass and the wood and between the glass and the\r\niron. The frame is hinged to the back-board by separable hinges, so that\r\nthe glass can be unhinged from the pad without removing the screws.\r\nHooks, such as are used for foundry flasks, connect the frame with the\r\npad upon the opposite side. A frame made in this manner is very stiff\r\nand springs but little, and its depth serves an excellent purpose. The\r\nair-cushion and the frame are so mounted that they can be easily turned\r\nto make the surface of the glass square with the direction of the sun's\r\nrays. It is necessary to have a tell tale connected with the apparatus,\r\nwhich will show when the surface of the glass has been thus adjusted.\r\nThe shadow of the deep frame is an inexpensive tell-tale, and enables\r\nthe operator to know when the adjustment is right. I have now described,\r\nin detail, the construction of the air-cushion with its back-board, as\r\nwell as that of the frame which holds the plate glass, and I think it\r\nwill be evident that the first cost of the materials of which they are\r\nmade is comparatively little, and that the workmanship required to\r\nproduce it is reduced to a minimum. It will also, I think, be evident\r\nthat a uniform pressure, of any desired intensity, can be had all over\r\nthe surface of the sensitized paper for the purpose of securing perfect\r\ncontact between it and the negative. The blue copies that are taken with\r\nthis apparatus are entirely free from blue lines when the negatives,\r\nchemicals, and paper are good.\r\n\r\n_The Mechanism for Adjusting the Surface of the Glass, until it shall be\r\nPerpendicular to the Direction of the Sun's Rays._--I have found many\r\nuses for the blue copying process in connection with the work of\r\ninstruction at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Notes printed\r\nby it are far better and less costly than those printed by papyrograph.\r\nI will not detain you now with an account of the uses that I have made\r\nof it. I will merely say that more than a year ago I found that my\r\nframe, which has a glass 3 feet x 4 feet, was wholly inadequate to the\r\nwork in hand, and I tried to increase the production from it by\r\ndiminishing the time of printing. The glass of this frame was\r\nhorizontal, except when one of its ends was tilted off from the slides\r\nwhich guided it when pushed out of the window; and I knew that it took\r\nthree or four times as long to print when the sun was low as it did when\r\nthe sun was near the meridian. I made plans for mounting this frame upon\r\na single axis, about which it could be turned after it had been pushed\r\nthrough the window, but I saw that no movement about a single axis would\r\ngive a satisfactory adjustment for all times of the year, and I\r\nconsidered what arrangement of two axes would permit a rapid and perfect\r\nadjustment, at all times, with the least trouble to the operator. It was\r\nevident that when the sun was in the equatorial plane, the surface of\r\nthe glass should contain a line which was parallel to the axis of the\r\nearth; and further, that if such a glass was firmly attached to an axis\r\nwhich was parallel to that of the earth, it would fulfill the desired\r\npurpose. For the glass, being once in adjustment, is only thrown out of\r\nposition by the rotation of the earth, and if the glass is rotated\r\nsufficiently about its own axis, in a direction opposite to that of the\r\nearth, it will retain its adjustment. In order to have the adjustment\r\nequally good when the sun was either north or south of the equatorial\r\nplane, it was sufficient to mount a secondary axis upon the primary one\r\nand at right angles to it. About this the glass could be turned through\r\nan angle of 231/2 deg., either way, from the position which it should have\r\nwhen the sun was in the equatorial plane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLUE PROCESS PRINTING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\n_The Construction of the Adjusting Mechanism._--I desired to have the\r\nmechanism as compact and inexpensive as possible, and to have the frame\r\nwell balanced about the primary axis, in every position. I also desired\r\nto have a rotation of nearly 180 deg. about the principal axis. The plan\r\nadopted will be most easily understood by referring to the drawing which\r\nillustrates it. The axes are composed chiefly of wood. They are built up\r\nfrom strips which are 3 inches x 7/8 inch, and from small pieces of 2\r\ninch plank. They are stiffly braced. A pair of ordinary hinges permit\r\nthe secondary rotation to occur, while a pair of cast iron dowel pins\r\nwith their sockets, such as are used in foundry flasks, serve as pivots\r\nduring the primary rotation.\r\n\r\n_The Adjustments._--The adjustment about the secondary axis does not\r\nneed to be made more frequently than once a week, or once a fortnight.\r\nIn order to prevent rotation about this axis when in adjustment, two\r\ncords lead from points which are beneath the back board, and as far\r\nremoved from the secondary axis as is convenient. Each cord passes\r\nforward and backward through four parallel holes in a wooden block which\r\nis attached to the primary axis. The cords can be easily slipped in the\r\nholes by pulling their loops, but the friction is so great that they\r\ncannot be slipped by pulling at either end. It takes about twice as long\r\nto make the adjustment as would be necessary if a more expensive device\r\nhad been used; but this device is at once so cheap, so secure, and has\r\nso seldom to be used, that it was thought to be best adapted for the\r\npurpose. To prevent rotation from occurring about the primary axis when\r\nit is not desired, a bar parallel to the secondary axis is attached by\r\nits middle point to the primary axis near one end. A cord passes from\r\neither end of this bar through cam shaped clamps, which were originally\r\ndesigned for clamping the cords of curtains with spring fixtures. These\r\nclamps are cheap. They are easily and quickly adjusted, and are very\r\nsecure.\r\n\r\nThe whole apparatus can be located upon the roof of a building, or, if\r\nconvenient, it can be mounted upon slides, and pushed through an open\r\nwindow when it is to be exposed to the light. If it is to be used upon a\r\nroof, a small hut, or shelter of some sort, near by is a great\r\nconvenience to the operator, particularly in winter.\r\n\r\n_An Inexpensive Drying Case for Use in Coating the Paper._--When the\r\napparatus is in continuous use, time may be saved by having a convenient\r\narrangement for drying the sheets that have been coated with the\r\nsensitizing liquid. I have made an inexpensive drying case which serves\r\nthe purpose very well. It consists simply of a light-tight rectangular\r\ncase of drawers. There are twenty-five drawers in all. They are\r\nconstructed in an inexpensive manner, and are the only parts of the case\r\nthat are worth describing. They are very shallow, being but 1-7/8 inches\r\ndeep, and as it appeared that the principal expense would be for the\r\nmaterials of which the bottoms of the drawers should be composed, it was\r\ndecided to make the bottoms of cotton cloth. This cloth is stretched\r\nupon a frame, the dimensions of which are greater than that of the paper\r\nto be dried. The stock of which the frame is made is pine, 11/4 inches\r\nwide, and three-eighths of an inch thick. The corners are simply mitered\r\ntogether and attached to each other by means of the wire staples that\r\nare commonly used for fastening together pages of manuscript, and which\r\nare called \"novelty staples.\" Eight staples are used at each miter, four\r\nabove and four below the joint. Two of the staples, at the top and near\r\nthe ends of the joint, are set square across it, and two others, at the\r\ntop and near the middle of the joint, are placed diagonally across it.\r\nThe staples at the bottom are similarly placed. The joint is quite firm\r\nand strong, and is likely to hold for an indefinite period with fair\r\nusage. The cloth, stretched upon the frame, is fastened to it by means\r\nof similar staples. A dark colored cloth not transparent to light is to\r\nbe preferred. A strip of pine, 1-13/16 inches wide, and three eighths of\r\nan inch thick, forms the vertical front of the drawer, and prevents the\r\nadmission of much light from the front while the sheet is drying. Two\r\ntriangular knee pieces, three-quarters of an inch thick, serve to\r\nconnect the front board with the frame, and four small screws with a few\r\nbrads are used in attaching them. The lower edge of the front board\r\ndrops one-quarter of an inch below the bottom of the drawer. My case\r\nstands in a poorly lighted room, and paper dried in this case and\r\nremoved to a portfolio as soon as it is dry does not seem to be injured\r\nby the light that reaches it. With the case in a well lighted room, I\r\nshould prefer to have outer doors to the case, made of ordinary board\r\nsix or eight inches wide, hinged to one end, and arranged to swing\r\nhorizontally across the front of the case. These would more completely\r\nprevent the admission of light. The opening of any one of the doors\r\nwould allow three or four of the drawers to be filled, while the rest of\r\nthe case would be comparatively dark at the same time.[2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Since this paper was read, I have seen in the\r\n    office of the City Engineer of Boston a drying case which is\r\n    similar in some respects to the one that I have devised. It has\r\n    been longer in use than my own. The drawers are simply the\r\n    ordinary mosquito netting frames covered with cotton netting.\r\n    They have no fronts, but a door covers the front of the case,\r\n    and shuts out the light.]\r\n\r\n_The Portfolio for Protecting the Sensitized Paper from Exposure to\r\nLight._--The sensitized paper is very well protected from exposure to\r\nlight, if kept in a portfolio or book, the brown paper leaves of which\r\nare considerably larger than the sensitized sheets. The sheets may be\r\nreturned to such a book after exposure, and washed at the convenience of\r\nthe operator. They can be washed more quickly and perfectly if _two_\r\nwater-tanks are provided in which to wash them. A few minutes' soaking\r\nwill remove nearly all of the sensitizing preparation which has not been\r\nfixed by the exposure. If the soaking is too long continued in water\r\nthat is much discolored by the sensitizing preparation, the sheets\r\nbecome saturated with the diluted preparation, and they may become\r\nslightly colored by _after_ exposure. If the first soaking is not too\r\nlong continued, and if the sheets are transferred at once to a second\r\nbath of clean water, which is kept slowly changing from an open faucet,\r\nthey may remain there until the soluble chemicals have been entirely\r\nextracted, and there will be no risk of staining by after exposure.\r\nWashing in two tanks is of more consequence when the ground is white and\r\nthe lines blue, than when the ground is blue and the lines white.\r\n\r\n_The Grades of Paper that are well Adapted for Blue Process Work._--I\r\nhave tested many grades of paper, to ascertain if they were well adapted\r\nfor blue process work. Some grades of brown Manila are very good; others\r\nhave little specks embedded in their surfaces which refuse to take on a\r\nblue tint; still others, when printed upon, have white lines that are\r\nwider than the corresponding black lines of the negative. The blue\r\nobtained upon bond paper appears to be particularly rich, and the whites\r\nremain pure; but bond paper cockles badly, and the cockles remain in the\r\nfinished print. Weston's linen record is an excellent paper. It is\r\nstrong, cockles but little, and dries very smooth. A paper that is used\r\nby Allen & Rowell, for carbon printing, is comparatively cheap, and is\r\nan excellent paper. It is not so stiff as the linen record, and the\r\nwhites are quite as pure. It does not cockle, neither does it curl while\r\nbeing sensitized. It comes in one hundred pound rolls, and is about\r\nthirty inches wide. The best papers are those that are prepared for\r\nphotographic work. The plain Saxe and the plain Rives both give\r\nexcellent results. Blue lines on a pure white ground can be obtained on\r\nthese papers, from photographic negatives, without difficulty. None of\r\nthe hard papers of good grade require the use of gum in the sensitizing\r\nliquid. The liquid penetrates the more porous papers too far when gum is\r\nnot used, and without it good whites are seldom obtained upon porous\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n_The Best Chemicals for this Work_ are the _recrystallized_ red\r\nprussiate of potash and the citrate of iron and ammonia, _which is\r\nmanufactured by Powers & Wightman_, of Philadelphia. If the red\r\nprussiate has not been recrystallized, the whites will be unsatisfactory\r\nand the samples of citrates of iron and ammonia which have come to us\r\nfrom other chemists than those named, have all proved unreliable for\r\nthis process.\r\n\r\n_The Sensitizing Liquid.--Its Proportions._--The blue process was\r\noriginally introduced from France, by the late Mr. A. L. Holley. I was\r\nindebted to Mr. P. Barnes, who was with Mr. Holley at the time, for an\r\nearly account of it, and I had the first blue process machine that was\r\nin use in New England. Since 1876, instruction in the use of the blue\r\nprocess has been given to the students of mechanical engineering of the\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, and they have caused its\r\nintroduction into many draughting offices. The proportions of the\r\nsensitizing liquid, as originally given me by Mr Barnes, were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Red prussiate of potash............. 8 parts.\r\n  Citrate of iron and ammonia......... 8 parts.\r\n  Gum arabic.......................... 1 part.\r\n  Water.............................. 80 parts.\r\n\r\n_Results of Experiments._--In our use, it first appeared that the gum\r\nmight be omitted from the preparation when sufficiently hard papers were\r\nused. Next, that a preparation containing\r\n\r\n  Red prussiate of potash........ 2 parts,\r\n  Citrate of iron and ammonia.... 3 \"\r\n  Water......................... 20 \"\r\n\r\nprinted more rapidly. This preparation I continue to use when much time\r\nmay elapse between sensitizing and printing; but, when the paper is to\r\nbe printed immediately after sensitizing, I use a larger proportion of\r\ncitrate of iron and ammonia. Before arriving at the conclusion that\r\nthese proportions were the best to be used, I made a series of purely\r\nempirical experiments, beginning with the proportions:\r\n\r\n  Red prussiate of potash.......... 10 parts.\r\n  Citrate of iron and ammonia....... 1 part.\r\n  Water............................ 50 parts.\r\n\r\nand ending with the proportions:\r\n\r\n  Red prussiate of potash............... 1 part.\r\n  Citrate of iron and ammonia.......... 10 parts.\r\n  Water................................ 50 \"\r\n\r\nI found the best plan for conducting these experiments to be: To coat a\r\nsheet of the paper with a given mixture; to cut the sheet into strips\r\nbefore exposure; to expose all the strips of the sheet, at the same\r\ntime, to the direct sunlight without an intervening negative; and to\r\nwithdraw them, one after another, at stated intervals. I found that with\r\neach mixture there was a time of exposure which would produce the\r\ndeepest blue, that with over-exposure the blue gradually turned gray,\r\nand that if a curve should be plotted, the abscissas of which should\r\nrepresent the time of exposure, and the ordinates of which should\r\nrepresent the intensity of the blue the curves drawn would have\r\napproximately an elliptical form, so that if one knew the exact time of\r\nexposure which would give the best result with any mixture, one might\r\ndeviate two or three minutes either way from that time without producing\r\na noticeable result. I have found that, with the same paper, the same\r\nblue results with any good proportions of the chemicals named, provided\r\na sufficient weight of both chemicals is applied to the surface; that an\r\nexcess of the red prussiate of potash renders the preparation less\r\nsensitive to light, and very much lengthens the necessary time of\r\nexposure; that the prints are finer with some excess of the red\r\nprussiate; that an excess of the citrate of iron and ammonia hastens the\r\ntime of printing materially; that a greater excess of the citrate causes\r\nthe whites to become badly stained by the iron, while a still greater\r\nexcess of the citrate, in a concentrated solution causes the sensitized\r\npaper to change without exposure to light, and to produce a redder blue\r\nor purple, which does not adhere to the paper, but may be washed off\r\nwith a sponge. I have found that the cheapest method of reproducing\r\ninked drawings that have been made on thick paper is not to trace them,\r\nbut to print the blues from a photographic glass negative; and also,\r\nthat the dry plate process is well adapted to such work in offices, when\r\none has become sufficiently experienced. Printed matter can also most\r\neasily and inexpensively be reproduced by the same means, when a small\r\nissue is required on each successive year. For the reproduction of\r\nmanuscript by the blue process, the best plan that I have found has been\r\nto write the manuscript upon the thinnest blue tinted French note-paper,\r\nwith black opaque ink--the stylographic ink is very good--and,\r\nafterward, to dip the paper into melted paraffine, and to dry the paper\r\nat the melting temperature. This operation, if cheaply done, requires\r\nspecial apparatus. For positive printing from the glass negative, I use\r\na multiple frame, by the aid of which I can print from 16 negatives at\r\nthe same time, upon a single sheet of paper. This frame is\r\ninterchangeable with the one that contains the plate glass. The\r\nnegatives are so arranged in the frame that the sheets can be cut and\r\nbound, as in the ordinary process of book binding. The time required for\r\nexposure, when printing from glass negatives, varies with the negative;\r\nand, in order to secure satisfactory results with the multiple frame it\r\nis necessary to stop the exposure of some, while the exposure of others\r\nis continued. I insert wooden or cloth stoppers into the frame for the\r\npurpose of stopping the exposure of certain negatives. When paraffined\r\nmanuscript is to be printed from, I find it convenient to have it\r\nwritten on sheets of small size, and to have these mounted upon an\r\nopaque frame of brown Manila paper, printing sixteen or more at a time,\r\ndepending upon the size of the printing frame. Many small tracings may\r\nbe similarly mounted upon a brown paper multiple frame, and may be\r\nprinted together upon a single sheet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECTRUM GRATINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a recent meeting of the London Physical Society, Prof. Rowland, of\r\nBaltimore, exhibited a number of his new concave gratings for giving a\r\ndiffraction spectrum. He explained the theory of their action. Gratings\r\ncan be ruled on any surface, if the lines are at a proper distance apart\r\nand of the proper form. The best surface, however, is a cylindrical or\r\nspherical one. The gratings are solid slabs of polished speculum metal\r\nruled with lines equidistant by a special machine of Prof. Rowland's\r\ninvention. An account of this machine will be published shortly. The\r\nnumber of lines per inch varied in the specimens shown from 5,000 to\r\n42,000, but higher numbers can be engraved by the cutting diamond. The\r\nauthor has designed an ingenious mechanical arrangement for keeping the\r\nphotographic plates in focus. In this way photographs of great\r\ndistinctness can be obtained. Prof. Rowland exhibited some 10 inches\r\nlong, which showed the E line doubled, and the large B group very\r\nclearly. Lines are divided by this method which have never been divided\r\nbefore, and the work of photographing takes a mere fraction of the time\r\nformerly required. A photographic plate sensitive throughout its length\r\nis got by means of a mixture of eosene, iodized collodion, and bromized\r\ncollodion. Prof. Rowland and Captain Abney, R.E., are at present engaged\r\nin preparing a new map of the whole spectrum with a focus of 18 feet.\r\n\r\nIn reply to Mr. Hilger, F.R.A.S., the author stated that if the metal is\r\nthe true speculum metal used by Lord Rosse, it would stand the effects\r\nof climate, he thought; but if too much copper were put in, it might\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nIn reply to Mr. Warren de la Rue, Prof. Rowland said that 42,000 was the\r\nlargest number of lines he had yet required to engrave on the metal.\r\n\r\nProf. Guthrie read a letter from Captain Abney, pointing out that Prof.\r\nRowland's plates gave clearer spectra than any others; they were free\r\nfrom \"ghosts,\" caused by periodicity in the ruling, and the speculum\r\nmetal had no particular absorption.\r\n\r\nProf. Dewar, F.R.S., observed that Prof. Liveing and he had been engaged\r\nfor three years past in preparing a map of the ultra-violet spectrum,\r\nwhich would soon be published. He considered the concave gratings to\r\nmake a new departure in the subject, and that they would have greatly\r\nfacilitated the preparation of his map.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW POCKET OPERA GLASS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POCKET OPERA GLASS.]\r\n\r\nInasmuch as high power combined with small size is usually required in\r\nan opera glass, manufacturers have always striven to unite these two\r\nfeatures in their instruments, and have succeeded in producing glasses\r\nwhich, although sufficiently small to be carried in the waistcoat\r\npocket, are nevertheless powerful enough to allow quite distant objects\r\nto be clearly distinguished. Recently, a Parisian optician has succeeded\r\nin constructing an instrument of this kind that is somewhat of a novelty\r\nin its way, since its mechanism allows it to be closed in such a manner\r\nas to take up no more space than a package of cigarettes (Fig. 1.) It is\r\nconstructed as follows:\r\n\r\nAB and CD (Fig. 1) are two metallic tubes, in which slide with slight\r\nfriction two other tubes. Into the upper part of the latter are inserted\r\ntwo hollow elliptical eye-pieces, which move therein with slight\r\nfriction, and which are united by the two supports tor the wheel, _bb_\r\n(Fig. 4), and endless screw that serve for focusing the instrument. The\r\neyepieces, TT, are held in the tube by means of two screws, _vv_ (Figs.\r\n2 and 4), in such a way that they can revolve around the latter as axes.\r\nThe lenses of the eye-piece are fixed therein by means of a copper ring.\r\nThe object glasses are placed in the ends of the tubes, AB and CD, at\r\n_oo_.\r\n\r\nWhen the instrument is closed, it forms a cylinder 35 millimeters in\r\ndiameter by 11 centimeters in length. To open it, it is grasped by the\r\nextremities and drawn apart horizontally so as to bring it into the\r\nposition shown in Fig. 2. Then it is turned over so that the screw, V,\r\npoints upward, while at the same time the two tubes are pressed gently\r\ndownward. This causes the eye-pieces to revolve around their axes, _vv_,\r\nand brings the two tubes parallel with each other.--_La Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT GREEK PAINTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lecture on ancient Greek painting was lately delivered by Professor\r\nC.T. Newton, C.B., at University College, London. The lecturer began by\r\nreminding his audience of the course of lectures on Greek sculpture,\r\nfrom the earliest times to the Roman period, which he completed this\r\nyear. The main epochs in the history of ancient sculpture had an\r\nintimate connection with the general history of the Greeks, with their\r\nintellectual, political, and social development. We could not profitably\r\nstudy the history of ancient sculpture except as part of the collateral\r\nstudy of ancient life as a whole, nor could we get a clear idea of the\r\nhistory of ancient sculpture without tracing out, so far as our\r\nimperfect knowledge permits, the characteristics and successive stages\r\nof ancient painting. Between these twin sister arts there had been in\r\nall times, and especially in Greek antiquity, a close sympathy and a\r\nreciprocal influence. The method in dealing with the history of Greek\r\npainting in this course would be similar to that adopted in the course\r\non sculpture. The evidence of ancient authors as to the works and\r\ncharacteristics of Greek painters would be first examined, then the\r\nextant monuments which illustrate the history of this branch of art\r\nwould be described. In the case of painting, the extant monuments were\r\nfew and far between, but we might learn much by the careful study of the\r\nmural paintings from the buried Campanian cities, Pompeii, Herculaneum,\r\nand those found in the tombs near Rome and Etruria. The paintings on\r\nGreek vases would enable us to trace the history of what is called\r\nceramographic art from B.C. 600 for nearly five centuries onward.\r\n\r\nAfter noticing the traditions preserved by Pliny and others as to the\r\nearliest painters, the lecturer passed on to the period after the\r\nPersian war. Polygnotos of Thasos was the earliest Greek painter of\r\ncelebrity. He flourished B.C. 480-460. At Athens he decorated with\r\npaintings the portico called the Stoa Poikile, the Temple of the\r\nDioscuri, the Temple of Theseus, and the Pinakotheke on the Akropolis.\r\nAt Delphi he painted on the walls of the building called Lesche two\r\ncelebrated pictures, the taking of Troy and the descent of Ulysses into\r\nHades. All these were mural paintings; the subjects were partly\r\nmythical, partly historical. Thus in the Stoa Poikile were represented\r\nthe taking of Troy, the battle of Theseus with the Amazons, the battle\r\nof Marathon. In the Temple of Theseus came the battle of the Lapiths and\r\nCentaurs and the battle of the Amazons again. In the other two Athenian\r\ntemples he treated mythological subjects. These great public works were\r\nexecuted during the administration of Kimon, to whom Polygnotos stood in\r\nthe same relation us Phidias did to Perikles, the successor of Kimon.\r\nThe paintings in the Stoa Poikile were executed by Polygnotos\r\ngratuitously, for which service the Athenians rewarded him with the\r\nfreedom of their city. His greatest and probably his earliest works were\r\nthe two pictures in the Lesche at Delphi. Of these there was a very full\r\ndescription in Pausanias. The building called Lesche was thought to have\r\nbeen of elliptical form, with a colonnade on either side, separated by a\r\nwall in the middle, and to have been about 90 ft in length. The figures\r\nwere probably life size.\r\n\r\nAccording to the list given by Pausanias, there were upward of seventy\r\nin each of the two pictures. In that representing the taking of Troy\r\nPolygnotos had brought together many incidents described in the Cyclic\r\nepics: Menelaos Agamemnon, Ulysses, Nestor, Neoptolemos, Antenor, Helen,\r\nAndromache, Kassandra, and many other figures, with which the Homeric\r\npoems have made us familiar, all appeared united in one skillful\r\ncomposition, arranged in groups. The other picture, the descent of\r\nUlysses into Hades to interrogate Teiresias, might be called a pictorial\r\nepic of Hades. On one side was the entrance, indicated by Charon's boat\r\ncrossing: the Acheron, and the evocation of Teiresias by Ulysses,\r\nbesides the punishment of Tityos and other wicked men; on the other side\r\nwere Tantalos and Sisyphos. Between these scenes, on the flanks, were\r\nvarious groups of heroes and heroines from the Trojan and other legends.\r\nFrom the remarks of ancient critics, it might be inferred that the\r\ngenius of Polygnotos, like that of Giotto, was far in advance of his\r\ntechnical skill. Aristotle called him the most ethical of painters, and\r\nrecommended the young artist to study his works in preference to those\r\nof his contemporary Pauson, who was ignobly realistic, or those of\r\nZeuxis, who had great technical merit, but was deficient in spiritual\r\nconception. The course will comprise four more lectures, as\r\nfollows--November 17, \"Greek Painters from B.C. 460 to Accession of\r\nAlexander the Great B.C. 336--Apollodoros, Zeuxis, Parrhasios,\r\nPamphilos, Aristides;\" November 24, \"Greek Painters from Age of\r\nAlexander to Augustan Age--Apelles, Protogenes, Theon;\" December 1,\r\n\"Pictures on Greek Fictile Vases;\" December 15, \"Mural Paintings from\r\nPompeii, Herculaneum, and other Ancient sites.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new Iowa State Capitol has thus far cost $2,000,000,\r\nand it will require $500,000 to finish it.

He cannot accept as final the phenomena of\r\nthe sensible world, but looks behind that world into another which rules\r\nthe sensible one. From this tendency of the human mind, systems of\r\nmythology and scientific theories have equally sprung. By the former the\r\nexperiences of volition, passion, power, and design, manifested among\r\nourselves, were transplanted, with the necessary modifications, into an\r\nunseen universe from which the sway and potency of those magnified human\r\nqualities were exerted. \"In the roar of thunder and in the violence of\r\nthe storm was felt the presence of a shouter and furious strikers, and\r\nout of the rain was created an Indra or giver of rain.\" It is\r\nsubstantially the same with science, the principal force of which is\r\nexpended in endeavoring to rend the veil which separates the sensible\r\nworld from an ultra-sensible one. In both cases our materials, drawn\r\nfrom the world of the senses, are modified by the imagination to suit\r\nintellectual needs. The \"first beginnings\" of Lucretius were not objects\r\nof sense, but they were suggested and illustrated by objects of sense.\r\nThe idea of atoms proved an early want on the part of minds in pursuit\r\nof the knowledge of nature. It has never been relinquished, and in our\r\nown day it is growing steadily in power and precision.\r\n\r\nThe union of bodies in fixed and multiple proportions constitutes the\r\nbasis of modern atomic theory. The same compound retains, for ever, the\r\nsame elements, in an unalterable ratio. We cannot produce pure water\r\ncontaining one part, by weight, of hydrogen and nine of oxygen, nor can\r\nwe produce it when the ratio is one to ten; but we can produce it from\r\nthe ratio of one to eight, and from no other. So also when water is\r\ndecomposed by the electric current, the proportion, as regards volumes,\r\nis as fixed as in the case of weights. Two volumes of hydrogen and one\r\nof oxygen invariably go the formation of water. Number and harmony, as\r\nin the Pythagorean system, are everywhere dominant in this under-world.\r\n\r\nFollowing the discovery of fixed proportions we have that of _multiple_\r\nproportions. For the same compound, as above stated, the elementary\r\nfactors are constant; but one elementary body often unites with another\r\nso as to form different compounds. Water, for example, is an oxide of\r\nhydrogen; but a peroxide of that substance also exists, containing\r\nexactly double the quantity of oxygen. Nitrogen also unites with oxygen\r\nin various ratios, but not in all. The union takes place, not gradually\r\nand uniformly, but by steps, a definite weight of matter being added at\r\neach step. The larger combining quantities of oxygen are thus multiples\r\nof the smaller ones. It is the same with other combinations.\r\n\r\nWe remain thus far in the region of fact: why not rest there? It might\r\nas well be asked why we do not, like our poor relations of the woods and\r\nforests, rest content with the facts of the sensible world. In virtue of\r\nour mental idiosyncrasy, we demand _why_ bodies should combine in\r\nmultiple proportions, and the outcome and answer of this question is the\r\natomic theory. The definite weights of matter, above referred to,\r\nrepresent the weights of atoms, indivisible by any force which chemistry\r\nhas hitherto brought to bear upon them. If matter were a _continuum_--if\r\nit were not rounded off, so to say, into these discrete atomic\r\nmasses--the impassable breaches of continuity which the law of multiple\r\nproportions reveals, could not be accounted for. These atoms are what\r\nMaxwell finely calls \"the foundation stones of the material universe,\"\r\nwhich, amid the wreck of composite matter, \"remain unbroken and unworn.\"\r\n\r\nA group of atoms drawn and held together by what chemists term affinity\r\nis called a molecule. The ultimate parts of all compound bodies are\r\nmolecules. A molecule of water, for example, consists of two atoms of\r\nhydrogen, which grasp and are grasped by one atom of oxygen. When water\r\nis converted into steam, the distances between the molecules are greatly\r\naugmented, but the molecules themselves continue intact. We must not,\r\nhowever, picture the constituent atoms of any molecule as held so\r\nrigidly together as to render intestine motion impossible. The\r\ninterlocked atoms have still liberty of vibration, which may, under\r\ncertain circumstances, become so intense as to shake the molecule\r\nasunder. Most molecules--probably all--are wrecked by intense heat, or\r\nin other words by intense vibratory motion; and many are wrecked by a\r\nvery moderate heat of the proper quality. Indeed, a weak force, which\r\nbears a suitable relation to the constitution of the molecule, can, by\r\ntimely savings and accumulations, accomplish what a strong force out of\r\nrelation fails to achieve.\r\n\r\nWe have here a glimpse of the world in which the physical philosopher\r\nfor the most part resides. Science has been defined as \"organized common\r\nsense;\" by whom I have forgotten; but, unless we stretch unduly the\r\ndefinition of common sense, I think it is hardly applicable to this\r\nworld of molecules. I should be inclined to ascribe the creation of that\r\nworld to inspiration rather than to what is currently known as common\r\nsense. For the natural history sciences the definition may stand--hardly\r\nfor the physical and mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\nThe sensation of light is produced by a succession of waves which strike\r\nthe retina in periodic intervals; and such waves, impinging on the\r\nmolecules of bodies, agitate their constituent atoms. These atoms are so\r\nsmall, and, when grouped to molecules, are so tightly clasped together,\r\nthat they are capable of tremors equal in rapidity to those of light and\r\nradiant heat. To a mind coming freshly to these subjects, the numbers\r\nwith which scientific men here habitually deal must appear utterly\r\nfantastical; and yet, to minds trained in the logic of science, they\r\nexpress most sober and certain truth. The constituent atoms of molecules\r\ncan vibrate to and fro millions of millions of times in a second. The\r\nwaves of light and of radiant heat follow each other at similar rates\r\nthrough the luminiferous ether. Further, the atoms of different\r\nmolecules are held together with varying degrees of tightness--they are\r\ntuned, as it were, to notes of different pitch. Suppose, then,\r\nlight-waves, or heat-waves, to impinge upon an assemblage of such\r\nmolecules, what may be expected to occur? The same as what occurs when a\r\npiano is opened and sung into. The waves of sound select the strings\r\nwhich respectively respond to them--the strings, that is to say, whose\r\nrates of vibration are the same as their own--and of the general series\r\nof strings these only sound. The vibratory motion of the voice, imparted\r\nfirst to the air, is here taken up by the strings. It may be regarded as\r\n_absorbed_, each string constituting itself thereby a new center of\r\nmotion. Thus also, as regards the tightly locked atoms of molecules on\r\nwhich waves of light or radiant heat impinge. Like the waves of sound\r\njust adverted to, the waves of ether select those atoms whose periods of\r\nvibration synchronize with their own periods of recurrence, and to such\r\natoms deliver up their motion. It is thus that light and radiant heat\r\nare absorbed.\r\n\r\nAnd here the statement, though elementary, must not be omitted, that the\r\ncolors of the prismatic spectrum, which are presented in an impure form\r\nin the rainbow, are due to different rates of atomic vibration in their\r\nsource, the sun. From the extreme red to the extreme violet, between\r\nwhich are embraced all colors visible to the human eye, the rapidity of\r\nvibration steadily increases, the length of the waves of ether produced\r\nby these vibrations diminishing in the same proportion. I say \"visible\r\nto the human eye,\" because there may be eyes capable of receiving visual\r\nimpression from waves which do not affect ours. There is a vast store of\r\nrays, or more correctly waves, beyond the red, and also beyond the\r\nviolet, which are incompetent to excite our vision; so that could the\r\nwhole length of the spectrum, visible and invisible, be seen by the same\r\neye, its length would be vastly augmented.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of molecules being wrecked by a moderate amount of heat of\r\nthe proper quality: let us examine this point for a moment. There is a\r\nliquid called nitrite of amyl--frequently administered to patients\r\nsuffering from heart disease. The liquid is volatile, and its vapor is\r\nusually inhaled by the patient. Let a quantity of this vapor be\r\nintroduced into a wide glass tube, and let a concentrated beam of solar\r\nlight be sent through the tube along its axis. Prior to the entry of the\r\nbeam, the vapor is as invisible as the purest air. When the light\r\nenters, a bright cloud is immediately precipitated on the beam. This is\r\nentirely due to the waves of light, which wreck the nitrite of amyl\r\nmolecules, the products of decomposition forming innumerable liquid\r\nparticles which constitute the cloud. Many other gases and vapors are\r\nacted upon in a similar manner. Now the waves that produce this\r\ndecomposition are by no means the most powerful of those emitted by the\r\nsun. It is, for example, possible to gather up the ultra-red waves into\r\na concentrated beam, and to send it through the vapor, like the beam of\r\nlight. But, though possessing vastly greater energy than the light\r\nwaves, they fail to produce decomposition. Hence the justification of\r\nthe statement already made, that a suitable relation must subsist\r\nbetween the molecules and the waves of ether to render the latter\r\neffectual.\r\n\r\nA very impressive illustration of the decomposing power of the waves of\r\nlight is here purposely chosen; but the processes of photography\r\nillustrate the same principle. The photographer, without fear,\r\nilluminates his developing room with light transmitted through red or\r\nyellow glass; but he dares not use blue glass, for blue light would\r\ndecompose his chemicals. And yet the waves of red light, measured by the\r\namount of energy which they carry, are immensely more powerful than the\r\nwaves of blue. The blue rays are usually called chemical rays--a\r\nmisleading term; for, as Draper and others have taught us, the rays that\r\nproduce the grandest chemical effects in nature, by decomposing the\r\ncarbonic acid and water which form the nutriment of plants, are not the\r\nblue ones. In regard, however, to the salts of silver, and many other\r\ncompounds, the blue rays are the most effectual. How is it then that\r\nweak waves can produce effects which strong waves are incompetent to\r\nproduce? This is a feature characteristic of periodic motion. In the\r\nexperiment of singing into an open piano already referred to, it is the\r\naccord subsisting between the vibrations of the voice and those of the\r\nstring that causes the latter to sound. Were this accord absent, the\r\nintensity of the voice might be quintupled, without producing any\r\nresponse. But when voice and string are identical in pitch, the\r\nsuccessive impulses add themselves together, and this addition renders\r\nthem, in the aggregate, powerful, though individually they may be weak.\r\nIt some such fashion the periodic strokes of the smaller ether waves\r\naccumulate, till the atoms on which their timed impulses impinge are\r\njerked asunder, and what we call chemical decomposition ensues.\r\n\r\nSavart was the first to show the influence of musical sounds upon liquid\r\njets, and I have now to describe an experiment belonging to this class,\r\nwhich bears upon the present question. From a screw-tap in my little\r\nAlpine kitchen I permitted, an hour ago, a vein of water to descend into\r\na trough, so arranging the flow that the jet was steady and continuous\r\nfrom top to bottom. A slight diminution of the orifice caused the\r\ncontinuous portion of the vein to shorten, the part further down\r\nresolving itself into drops. In my experiment, however, the vein, before\r\nit broke, was intersected by the bottom of the trough. Shouting near the\r\ndescending jet produced no sensible effect upon it. The higher notes of\r\nthe voice, however powerful, were also ineffectual. But when the voice\r\nwas lowered to about 130 vibrations a second, the feeblest utterance of\r\nthis note sufficed to shorten, by one half, the continuous portion of\r\nthe jet. The responsive drops ran along the vein, pattered against the\r\ntrough, and scattered a copious spray round their place of impact. When\r\nthe note ceased, the continuity and steadiness of the vein were\r\nimmediately restored. The formation of the drops was here periodic; and\r\nwhen the vibrations of the note accurately synchronized with the periods\r\nof the drops, the waves of sound aided what Plateau has proved to be the\r\nnatural tendency of the liquid cylinder to resolve itself into\r\nspherules, and virtually decomposed the vein.\r\n\r\nI have stated, without proof, that where absorption occurs, the motion\r\nof the ether-waves is taken up by the constituent atoms of molecules. It\r\nis conceivable that the ether-waves, in passing through an assemblage of\r\nmolecules, might deliver up their motion to each molecule as a whole,\r\nleaving the relative positions of the constituent atoms unchanged. But\r\nthe long series of reactions, represented by the deportment of nitrite\r\nof amyl vapor, does not favor this conception; for, were the atoms\r\nanimated solely by a common motion, the molecules would not be\r\ndecomposed. The fact of decomposition, then, goes to prove the atoms to\r\nbe the seat of the absorption. They, in great part, take up the energy\r\nof the ether-waves, whereby their union is severed, and the building\r\nmaterials of the molecules are scattered abroad.\r\n\r\nMolecules differ in stability; some of them, though hit by waves of\r\nconsiderable force, and taking up the motions of these waves,\r\nnevertheless hold their own with a tenacity which defies decomposition.\r\nAnd here, in passing, I may say that it would give me extreme pleasure\r\nto be able to point to my researches in confirmation of the solar theory\r\nrecently enunciated by my friend the President of the British\r\nAssociation. But though the experiments which I have made on the\r\ndecomposition of vapors by light might be numbered by the thousand, I\r\nhave, to my regret, encountered no fact which prove that free aqueous\r\nvapor is decomposed by the solar rays, or that the sun is reheated by\r\nthe combination of gases, in the severance of which it had previously\r\nsacrificed its heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe memorable investigations of Leslie and Rumford, and the subsequent\r\nclassical reasearches of Melloni, dealt, in the main, with the\r\nproperties of radiant heat; while in my investigations, radiant heat,\r\ninstead of being regarded as an end, was employed as a means of\r\nexploring molecular condition. On this score little could be said until\r\nthe gaseous form of matter was brought under the dominion of experiment.\r\nThis was first effected in 1859, when it was proved that gases and\r\nvapors, notwithstanding the open door which the distances between their\r\nmolecules might be supposed to offer to the heat waves, were, in many\r\ncases, able effectually to bar their passage. It was then proved that\r\nwhile the elementary gases and their mixtures, including among the\r\nlatter the earth's atmosphere, were almost as pervious as a vacuum to\r\nordinary radiant heat, the compound gases were one and all absorbers,\r\nsome of them taking up with intense avidity the motion of the\r\nether-waves.\r\n\r\nA single illustration will here suffice. Let a mixture of hydrogen and\r\nnitrogen, in the proportion of three to fourteen by weight, be inclosed\r\nin a space through which are passing the heat rays from an ordinary\r\nstove. The gaseous mixture offers no measurable impediment to the rays\r\nof heat. Let the hydrogen and nitrogen now unite to form the compound\r\nammonia. A magical change instantly occurs. The number of atoms present\r\nremains unchanged. The transparency of the compound is quite equal to\r\nthat of the mixture prior to combination. No change is perceptible to\r\nthe eye, but the keen vision of experiment soon detects the fact that\r\nthe perfectly transparent and highly attenuated ammonia resembles pitch\r\nor lampblack in its behavior to the rays of heat.\r\n\r\nThere is probably boldness, if not rashness, in the attempt to make\r\nthese ultra-sensible actions generally intelligible, and I may have\r\nalready transgressed the limits beyond which the writer of a familiar\r\narticle cannot profitably go. There may, however, be a remnant of\r\nreaders willing to accompany me, and for their sakes I proceed. A\r\nhundred compounds might be named which, like the ammonia, are\r\ntransparent to light, but more or less opaque--often, indeed, intensely\r\nopaque--to the rays of heat from obscure sources. Now the difference\r\nbetween these latter rays and the light rays is purely a difference of\r\nperiod of vibration. The vibrations in the case of light are more rapid,\r\nand the ether waves which they produce are shorter, than in the case of\r\nobscure heat. Why, then, should the ultra-red waves be intercepted by\r\nbodies like ammonia, while the more rapidly recurrent waves of the whole\r\nvisible spectrum are allowed free transmission? The answer I hold to be\r\nthat, by the act of chemical combination, the vibrations of the\r\nconstituent atoms of the molecules are rendered so sluggish as to\r\nsynchronize with the motions of the longer waves. They resemble loaded\r\npiano strings, or slowly descending water jets, requiring notes of low\r\npitch to set them in motion.\r\n\r\nThe influence of synchronism between the \"radiant\" and the \"absorbent\"\r\nis well shown by the behavior of carbonic acid gas. To the complex\r\nemission from our heated stove, carbonic acid would be one of the most\r\ntransparent of gases. For such waves olefiant gas, for example, would\r\nvastly transcend it in absorbing power. But when we select a radiant\r\nwith whose waves the atoms of carbonic acid are in accord, the case is\r\nentirely altered. Such a radiant is found in a carbonic oxide flame,\r\nwhere the radiating body is really hot carbonic acid. To this special\r\nradiation carbonic acid is the most opaque of gases.\r\n\r\nAnd here we find ourselves face to face with a question of great\r\ndelicacy and importance. Both as a radiator and as an absorber, carbonic\r\nacid is, in general, a feeble gas. It is beaten in this respect by\r\nchloride of methyl, ethylene, ammonia, sulphurous acid, nitrous oxide,\r\nand marsh gas. Compared with some of these gases, its behavior, in fact,\r\napproaches that of elementary bodies. May it not help to explain their\r\nneutrality? The doctrine is now very generally accepted that atoms of\r\nthe same kind may, like atoms of different kinds, group themselves to\r\nmolecules. Affinity exists between hydrogen and hydrogen and between\r\nchlorine and chlorine, as well as between hydrogen and chlorine. We have\r\nthus homogeneous molecules as well as heterogeneous molecules, and the\r\nneutrality so strikingly exhibited by the elements may be due to a\r\nquality of which carbonic acid furnishes a partial illustration. The\r\npaired atoms of the elementary molecules may be so out of accord with\r\nthe periods of the ultra red waves--the vibrating periods of these atoms\r\nmay, for example, be so rapid--as to disqualify them both from emitting\r\nthose waves, and from accepting their energy. This would practically\r\ndestroy their power, both as radiators and absorbers. I have reason to\r\nknow that a distinguished authority has for some time entertained this\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, refresh ourselves by occasional contact with the solid\r\nground of experiment, and an interesting problem now lies before us\r\nawaiting experimental solution. Suppose two hundred men to be scattered\r\nequably throughout the length of Pall Mall. By timely swerving now and\r\nthen, a runner from St. James's Palace to the Athenaeum Club might be\r\nable to get through such a crowd without much hinderance. But supposing\r\nthe men to close up so as to form a dense file crossing Pall Mall from\r\nnorth to south; such a barrier might seriously impede, or entirely stop,\r\nthe runner. Instead of a crowd of men, let us imagine a column of\r\nmolecules under small pressure, thus resembling the sparsely distributed\r\ncrowd. Let us suppose the column to shorten, without change in the\r\nquantity of matter, until the molecules are so squeezed together as to\r\nresemble the closed file across Pall Mall. During these changes of\r\ndensity, would the action of the molecules upon a beam of heat passing\r\namong them at all resemble the action of the crowd upon the runner?\r\n\r\nWe must answer this question by direct experiment. To form our molecular\r\ncrowd we place, in the first instance, a gas or vapor in a tube 38\r\ninches long, the ends of which are closed with circular windows,\r\nair-tight, but formed of a substance which offers little or no\r\nobstruction to the calorific waves. Calling the measured value of a heat\r\nbeam passing through this tube 100, we carefully determine the\r\nproportionate part of this total absorbed by the molecules in the tube.\r\nWe then gather precisely the same number of molecules into a column 10.8\r\ninches long, the one column being thus three and a half times the length\r\nof the other. In this case also we determine the quantity of radiant\r\nheat absorbed. By the depression of a barometric column, we can easily\r\nand exactly measure out the proper quantities of the gaseous body. It is\r\nobvious that one mercury inch of vapor, in the long tube, would\r\nrepresent precisely the same amount of matter--or, in other words, the\r\nsame number of molecules--as 31/2 inches in the short one; while 2\r\ninches of vapor in the long tube would be equivalent to 7 inches in the\r\nshort one.\r\n\r\nThe experiments have been made with the vapors of two very volatile\r\nliquids, namely, sulphuric ether and hydride of amyl. The sources of\r\nradiant heat were, in some cases, an incandescent lime cylinder, and in\r\nothers a spiral of platinum wire, heated to bright redness by an\r\nelectric current. One or two of the measurements will suffice for the\r\npurposes of illustration. First, then, as regards the lime light; for 1\r\ninch of pressure in the long tube, the absorption was 18.4 per cent. of\r\nthe total beam; while for 3.5 inches of pressure in the short tube, the\r\nabsorption was 18.8 per cent., or almost exactly the same as the former.\r\nFor 2 inches pressure, moreover, in the long tube, the absorption was\r\n25.7 per cent.; while for 7 inches in the short tube it was 25.6 per\r\ncent. of the total beam. Thus closely do the absorptions in the two\r\ncases run together--thus emphatically do the molecules assert their\r\nindividuality. As long as their number is unaltered, their action on\r\nradiant heat is unchanged. Passing from the lime light to the\r\nincandescent spiral, the absorptions of the smaller equivalent\r\nquantities, in the two tubes, were 23.5 and 23.4 per cent.; while the\r\nabsorptions of the larger equivalent quantities were 32.1 and 32.6 per\r\ncent., respectively. This constancy of absorption, when the density of a\r\ngas or vapor is varied, I have called \"the conservation of molecular\r\naction.\"\r\n\r\nBut it may be urged that the change of density, in these experiments,\r\nhas not been carried far enough to justify the enunciation of a law of\r\nmolecular physics. The condensation into less than one-third of the\r\nspace does not, it may be said, quite represent the close file of men\r\nacross Pall Mall. Let us therefore push matters to extremes, and\r\ncontinue the condensation till the vapor has been squeezed into a\r\nliquid. To the pure change of density we shall then have added the\r\nchange in the state of aggregation. The experiments here are more easily\r\ndescribed than executed; nevertheless, by sufficient training,\r\nscrupulous accuracy, and minute attention to details, success may be\r\ninsured. Knowing the respective specific gravities, it is easy, by\r\ncalculation, to determine the condensation requisite to reduce a column\r\nof vapor of definite density and length to a layer of liquid of definite\r\nthickness. Let the vapor, for example, be that of sulphuric ether, and\r\nlet it be introduced into our 38 inch tube till a pressure of 7.2 inches\r\nof mercury is obtained. Or let it be hydride of amyl, of the same\r\nlength, and at a pressure of 6.6 inches. Supposing the column to\r\nshorten, the vapor would become proportionally denser, and would, in\r\neach case, end in the production of a layer of liquid exactly one\r\nmillimeter in thickness.[1] Conversely, a layer of liquid ether or of\r\nhydride of amyl, of this thickness, were its molecules freed from the\r\nthrall of cohesion, would form a column of vapor 38 inches long, at a\r\npressure of 7.2 inches in the one case, and of 6.6 inches in the other.\r\nIn passing through the liquid layer, a beam of heat encounters the same\r\nnumber of molecules as in passing through the vapor layer: and our\r\nproblem is to decide, by experiment, whether, in both cases, the\r\nmolecule is not the dominant factor, or whether its power is augmented,\r\ndiminished, or otherwise overridden by the state of aggregation.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: The millimeter is 1-25th of an inch.]\r\n\r\nUsing the sources of heat before mentioned, and employing diathermanous\r\nlenses, or silvered minors, to render the rays from those sources\r\nparallel, the absorption of radiant heat was determined, first for the\r\nliquid layer, and then for its equivalent vaporous layer. As before, a\r\nrepresentative experiment or two will suffice for illustration. When the\r\nsubstance was sulphuric ether, and the source of radiant heat an\r\nincandescent platinum spiral, the absorption by the column of vapor was\r\nfound to be 66.7 per cent. of the total beam. The absorption of the\r\nequivalent liquid layer was next determined, and found to be 67.2 per\r\ncent. Liquid and vapor, therefore, differed from each only 0.5 per\r\ncent.; in other words, they were practically identical in their action.\r\nThe radiation from the lime light has a greater power of penetration\r\nthrough transparent substances than that from the spiral. In the\r\nemission from both of these sources we have a mixture of obscure and\r\nluminous rays; but the ratio of the latter to the former, in the lime\r\nlight is greater than in the spiral; and, as the very meaning of\r\ntransparency is perviousness to the luminous rays, the emission in which\r\nthese rays are predominant must pass most freely through transparent\r\nsubstances. Increased transmission implies diminished absorption; and\r\naccordingly, the respective absorption of ether vapor and liquid ether,\r\nwhen the lime light was used, instead of being 66.7 and 67.2 per cent.,\r\nwere found to be\r\n\r\n  Vapor....................33.3 per cent.\r\n  Liquid...................33.3   \"\r\n\r\nno difference whatever being observed between the two states of\r\naggregation. The same was found true of hydride of amyl.\r\n\r\nThis constancy and continuity of the action exerted on the waves of heat\r\nwhen the state of aggregation is changed, I have called \"the thermal\r\ncontinuity of liquids and vapors.\" It is, I think, the strongest\r\nillustration hitherto adduced of the conservation of molecular action.\r\n\r\nThus, by new methods of search, we reach a result which was long ago\r\nenunciated on other grounds. Water is well known to be one of the most\r\nopaque of liquids to the waves of obscure heat. But if the relation of\r\nliquids to their vapors be that here shadowed forth, if in both cases\r\nthe molecule asserts itself to be the dominant factor, then the\r\ndispersion of the water of our seas and rivers, as invisible aqueous\r\nvapor in our atmosphere, does not annul the action of the molecules on\r\nsolar and terrestrial heat. Both are profoundly modified by this\r\nconstituent; but as aqueous vapor is transparent, which, as before\r\nexplained, means pervious to the luminous rays, and as the emission from\r\nthe sun abounds in such rays, while from the earth's emission they are\r\nwholly absent, the vapor screen offers a far greater hinderance to the\r\noutflow of heat from the earth toward space than to the inflow from the\r\nsun toward the earth. The elevation of our planet's temperature is\r\ntherefore a direct consequence of the existence of aqueous vapor in our\r\nair. Flimsy as that garment may appear, were it removed terrestrial life\r\nwould probably perish through the consequent refrigeration.\r\n\r\nI have thus endeavored to give some account of a recent incursion into\r\nthat ultra-sensible world mentioned at the outset of this paper. Invited\r\nby my publishers, with whom I have now worked in harmony for a period of\r\ntwenty years, to send some contribution to the first number of their new\r\nMagazine, I could not refuse them this proof of my good will.\r\n\r\nJ. TYNDALL\r\n\r\nAlp Lusgen, September 4, 1882\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe German empire has now about 34,000,000 acres of\r\nforest, valued at $400,000,000, and appropriates $500,000\r\neven year to increase and maintain the growth of trees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR MEASURING ELECTRICITY AT THE UPPER SCHOOL OF TELEGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Electro Tuning Forks and their Uses._--On a former occasion I described\r\nan instrument to which, in 1873, I gave the name _Electro-Tuning Fork_,\r\nand which is nothing else than a tuning fork whose motion is kept up\r\nelectrically in such a way as to last indefinitely, provided that the\r\nelements of the pile are renewed gradually, and that from time to time\r\nthe metallic contact is changed, which causes, at every oscillation, the\r\ncurrent to pass from the pile into the magnet, which keeps up the\r\nvibration.\r\n\r\nWe reproduce herewith, in Fig. 1, a cut showing in projection one of the\r\nsimplest forms of the apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--CONSTANT VIBRATOR.]\r\n\r\nIf we imagine the platinum or steel style, s, of the figure to be done\r\naway with, as well as the platinized plate, I, and its communication\r\nwith the negative pole of the pile, P, we shall have the ordinary\r\ninstrument kept in operation electrically by the aid of the\r\nelectro-magnet, E, the style, s, the interrupting plate, I, and the\r\npile.\r\n\r\nIf we preserve the parts above mentioned, the instrument will possess\r\nthe property of having vibrations of a constant amplitude if sufficient\r\nenergy be kept up in the pile. In fact, when the amplitude is\r\nsufficiently great to cause the style, s, to touch the plate, I, it\r\nwill be seen that at such a moment the current no longer passes through\r\nthe electromagnet, and the vibration is no longer maintained. The\r\namplitude cannot exceed an extent which shall permit the style, s, to\r\ntouch I.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions, the duration of the vibrations remains exactly\r\nconstant, as does also the vibratory intensity of the entire instrument.\r\nThe measurement of time, then, by an instrument of this kind is, indeed,\r\nas perfect as it could well be.\r\n\r\nThis complication in the arrangement of the apparatus has no importance\r\nas regards those tuning forks the number of whose vibrations exceeds a\r\nhundred per second, for in such a case these are given an amplitude of a\r\nfew millimeters only; but it would be of importance with regard to\r\ninstruments whose number of vibrations is very small, and to which it\r\nmight be desirable to give great amplitude; for then, as I have long ago\r\nshown, the duration of the oscillation would depend a little on the\r\namplitude, but a very little, it is true.\r\n\r\nI shall not refer now to the applications of these instruments in\r\nchronography, but will rather point out first the applications in which\r\nthey are destined to produce an effective power.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose it is necessary to make them pretty massive. The number\r\nof the vibrations depends upon such massiveness, and it is necessity to\r\nknow the relation which exists between these two quantities in order to\r\nbe able to construct an instrument under determinate conditions. I made\r\nin former years such a research with regard to tuning forks of prismatic\r\nform, that is to say, of a constant rectangular section continuing even\r\ninto the bent portion where the parallel branches are united by a\r\nsemicylinder, at the middle of which is the wrought iron rod as well as\r\nthe branches. The _thickness_ of the instrument is the dimension\r\nparallel to the vibrations; its _width_ is the dimension which is\r\nperpendicular to them, and its _length_ is reckoned from the extremity\r\nof the branches up to the middle of the curved portion.\r\n\r\nIt is found that the number of vibrations is independent of the width,\r\nproportional to the thickness, and very nearly inverse ratio of the\r\nsquare of the length, provided the latter exceeds ten centimeters.\r\n\r\nIf we represent the length by l, the thickness by e, and the number\r\nof vibrations by n, we shall have the following formula:\r\n\r\n  n = k x ( e / l squared )\r\n\r\nin which k is a constant quantity whose value depends upon the nature\r\nof the metal of which the tuning fork is made.\r\n\r\nThis constant varies very little from steel to malleable cast iron, and\r\nit may be taken as equal to 818270.\r\n\r\nThus, then, we have a means of constructing a tuning fork in which two\r\nof the three quantities, n, e, l, are given in advance. Experience\r\nproves that no errors are committed exceeding one or two per cent.\r\n\r\nIt is seen from this that there is a means of increasing the mass of the\r\ninstrument without changing anything in the thickness, the length or,\r\nconsequently, the number of vibrations, and this is by increasing the\r\n_breadth_.\r\n\r\nIt is in this way that I have succeeded in having long massive tuning\r\nforks made of malleable iron, giving no more than 12 to 15 vibrations\r\nper second, and vibrating with perfect regularity. Fig. 2, annexed,\r\nshows one of these instruments of about 55 centimeters length, whose\r\nbreadth, E, is from 5 to 6 centimeters, and which makes about fifteen\r\ndouble vibrations per second only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--THE ELECTRICAL TUNING FORK.]\r\n\r\nThis number might be still further reduced, but at the expense of our\r\nbeing led to exaggerate the longitudinal dimensions of the apparatus in\r\nsuch a way as to make it inconvenient. The object may be attained more\r\nsimply by loading the branches with slides supporting leaden weights, M,\r\nof 500 grammes each. By fixing these slides at different points on the\r\nbranches, the number of vibrations can be made to vary from simple to\r\ndouble, and even triple. Thus, by fixing them at the extremity of the\r\nbranches the number of the vibrations is reduced to 5 or 6.\r\n\r\nThere will be seen in the figure the electro-magnet which keeps up the\r\nvibration. This is formed of three simple electro-magnets, whose bobbins\r\nhave a resistance of no more than 10 ohms, and which are united in\r\nseries. The interrupting plate, P, against which the style, s, rests\r\nat each vibration, is capable of a forward movement, or one of recoil,\r\nby the aid of a screw, V, and of an eccentric movement which is produced\r\nby a small handle, m, and during which its plane remains invariable.\r\nThis arrangement permits the point of contact of the style and plate to\r\nbe varied without changing the precision with which the contact takes\r\nplace, and all the points of the plate to be slowly used in succession\r\nbefore replacing it. The motion is produced by means of a relatively\r\nweak pile, whose poles are connected to the terminals, A and A'. Three\r\nCallaud elements of triple surface, renewed one after the other every\r\nmonth at the most, are sufficient to keep up the vibrations\r\ncontinuously, day and night, without interruption, and that too even\r\nwhen the instrument is employed in producing a small mechanical power,\r\nas we shall see further on.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen how electro-tuning forks may be constructed of large\r\ndimensions, of large mass, and giving a small number of vibrations per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nSuch instruments are well fitted to perform the role of electrical\r\ninterrupters, and it was in such a character that one of them figured in\r\nthe Exhibition of the Upper School of Telegraphy as a type of an\r\ninterrupter for testing piles.\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to test a pile to ascertain the practicability of\r\nemploying it in telegraphy, it is necessary to make it perform a work\r\nwhich shall be as nearly as possible identical with that which it will\r\nbe called on to do, until it is used up, to estimate the duration of\r\nsuch work, to measure regularly the constants of the pile, the\r\nelectro-motive power, and the internal resistance. Usually, in\r\ntelegraphy, this work consists in sending over a line of a certain\r\nresistance intermittent currents, through the intermedium of suitable\r\nmanipulators. It suffices then to cause the branches of the electro\r\ntuning fork to play the role of one of these manipulators. For doing\r\nthis the tuning fork carries two insulating ebonite or ivory strips, B B\r\n(Fig. 3), which, at every oscillation, abut against vertical brass\r\nsprings, r. Each of these latter is located in front of the platinized\r\npoint of a screw, v, which is affixed to a small metallic tongue. The\r\nsprings and tongues are insulated from each other, and are mounted on a\r\npiece which may be moved by a screw, V, so as to cause the springs of\r\nthe strips, B B', to approach or recede according to the amplitude of\r\nthe instrument's vibrations. Each spring and tongue is connected with\r\nterminals affixed to the base of the apparatus. One of the poles of one\r\nelement, P, of the pile is connected with the tongue and corresponding\r\nscrew, while the other pole is connected with the screw in front of it\r\nthrough the intermedium of a galvanometer, g squared, which gives the\r\nintensity of the intermittent current, and of a resistance coil,\r\nb squared, which performs the role of an artificial telegraph line. The\r\napparatus being set in operation, it will be seen that the current from\r\nthe pile is emitted once at every vibration.\r\n\r\nThus there may be exhausted as many pile elements as there are springs,\r\nand that, too, simultaneously; and the contacts of the screws and\r\nsprings can be regulated in such a way that the duration of the\r\nemissions shall be the same for all.\r\n\r\nAt the laboratory of the School of Telegraphy one of these instruments\r\nhas operated without interruption, day and night, during eighteen\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--VERY RAPID ELECTRIC TUNING FORK]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus shown in Fig. 4 is also an interrupting electro-tuning\r\nfork, but it makes a much greater number of vibrations than the\r\npreceding, and may serve for other electric tests.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the tuning fork is kept up electrically by the aid of\r\nthe screw, v, and the corresponding plate; of the style, s, and of\r\nthe fine wire spiral spring, f, both insulated from the fork, from the\r\nelectro-magnet, N, and from the two wires, F F', which communicate with\r\na pile.\r\n\r\nThe interrupting system is symmetrical with the first. It consists of\r\nthe style, s, of the spiral spring, f, of the screw, v, and of the\r\nplate that this carries at its extremity. The terminal, B, which carries\r\nthe spring, f, and the rod which carries the screw being insulated\r\nfrom each other, it is only necessary to cause to terminate therein the\r\nextremities of a circuit comprising one pile, in order to produce in the\r\ncircuit a number of interruptions equal to that of the tuning fork's\r\nvibrations. Provided the lengths of the springs, f and _f'_, are\r\nproper, such vibrations will not be altered.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the instrument is so arranged as to produce vibrations whose\r\n_duration can be varied at pleasure and kept constant_ during the whole\r\ntime the experiments last. This is done by modifying the _amplitude_ of\r\nthe vibrations; for the greater the amplitude, the longer likewise the\r\nduration of the contact of the style, s, on the corresponding plate,\r\nand the shorter the duration of the interruption. In order to modify the\r\namplitude, the action of the electro-magnet on the branches of the\r\napparatus is made to vary. To effect this, the electro-magnet is made\r\nmovable perpendicularly by the aid of a screw, V, between two slides, so\r\nthat the core, N, may be moved with respect to the median line of the\r\nbranches, and even be raised above them. Its action diminishes,\r\nnecessarily, while it is being raised, and the amplitude of the\r\nvibrations likewise diminishes gradually and continuously. It may thus\r\nbe made, without difficulty, to vary from two to three tenths of a\r\nmillimeter to three or four millimeters or more.\r\n\r\nBut it is not sufficient to cause the amplitude to vary; it is necessary\r\nto measure it and to keep it constant at the value desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5]\r\n\r\nThe measurement is effected by the aid of a very simple apparatus that I\r\nhave before described under the name of the _vibrating micrometer_. This\r\nis a small square of paper carrving a design like that shown in Fig. 5,\r\nand which is seen in Fig. 4 glued to one of the masses, M, which serve\r\nto vary the number of the instrument's vibrations. This figure is in\r\nfact, an angle, one of whose sides is graduated into millimeters, for\r\nexample, and the other forms the edge of a wide black band. The apex of\r\nthe angle is above and the divided side is perpendicular to the\r\ndirection of the vibrations.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions, when the fork is vibrating, the apex of the\r\nangle, by virtue of the persistence of impressions upon the retina,\r\n_seems_ to advance along the graduation in measure as the amplitude of\r\nthe vibrations increases. If an angle has been drawn such that the slope\r\nof one of its sides to the other is one-tenth, it is easy to see that\r\nfor each millimeter passed over _apparently_ by the apex of the angle,\r\nthe amplitude will increase by two-tenths of a millimeter.\r\n\r\nThis is the way, then, that the amplitude is measured. On another hand,\r\nit suffices to keep the apex of the angle of the micrometer immovable,\r\nin order to be sure of the constancy of the tuning fork's amplitude; and\r\nthis is done, when necessary, by causing the screw, V, to move slightly.\r\n\r\nThe instrument represented in Fig. 4 is, moreover, fixed to a support\r\ndevised by Mr. A. Duboscq, so as to make it possible to give the tuning\r\nfork every position possible with respect to a vertical plane; to raise\r\nit or lower it, and to move it backward or forward so that it may be\r\nemployed for chimography, and in all those experiments in which\r\nelectro-tuning folks are used.\r\n\r\nE.

If one\r\ncuts a female gorilla-skull in the same fashion, the resemblance is\r\ntruly astonishing, and we may say that the only human feature in the\r\nskull is its size.\"[1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Grant Allen, \"On Primitive Man,\" p. 314.]\r\n\r\nIn testing the question as between Linnaeus and Cuvier of the zoological\r\nvalue of the differences between lowest man and highest ape, a\r\nnaturalist would not limit his comparison of a portion of the human\r\nskull with the corresponding one of a female ape, but would extend it to\r\nthe young or immature gorilla, and also to the adult male; he would then\r\nfind the generic and specific characters summed up, so far, at least, as\r\na portion or \"fragment\" of the skull might show them. What is posed as\r\nthe \"Neanderthal skull\" is the roof of the brain-case, or \"calvarium\" of\r\nthe anatomist, including the pent-house overhanging the eye-holes or\r\n\"orbits.\" There is no other part of the fragment which can be supposed\r\nto be meant by the \"large bosses\" of the above quotation. And, on this\r\nassumption, I have to state that the super-orbital ridge in the\r\ncalvarium in question is but little more prominent than in certain human\r\nskulls of both higher and lower races, and of both the existing and\r\ncave-dwelling periods. It is a variable cranial character, by no means\r\nindicative of race, but rather of sex.\r\n\r\nLimiting the comparison to that on which the writer quoted bases his\r\nconclusions--apparently the superficial extent of the roof plate--its\r\ngreater extent as compared with that of a gorilla equaling, probably, in\r\nweight the entire frame of the individual from the Neanderthal cave, is\r\nstrongly significant of the superiority of size of brain in the\r\ncave-dweller. The inner surface moreover indicates the more complex\r\ncharacter of the soft organ on which it was moulded; the precious \"gray\r\nsubstance\" being multiplied by certain convolutions which are absent in\r\nthe apes. But there is another surface which the unbiased zoologist\r\nfinds it requisite to compare. In the human \"calvarium\" in question, the\r\nmid-line traced backward from the super-orbital ridge runs along a\r\nsmooth track. In the gorilla a ridge is raised from along the major part\r\nof that tract to increase the surface giving attachment to the biting\r\nmuscles. Such ridge in this position varies only in height in the female\r\nand the male adult ape, as the specimens in the British Museum\r\ndemonstrate. In the Neanderthal individual, as in the rest of mankind,\r\nthe corresponding muscles do not extend their origins to the upper\r\nsurface of the cranium, but stop short at the sides forming the inner\r\nwall or boundary of what are called the \"temples,\" defined by Johnson as\r\nthe \"upper part of the sides of the head,\" whence our \"biting muscles\"\r\nare called \"temporal,\" as the side-bones of the skull to which they are\r\nattached are also the \"temporal bones.\" In the superficial comparison to\r\nwhich Mr. Grant Allen has restricted himself in bearing testimony on a\r\nquestion which perhaps affects our fellow-creatures, in the right sense\r\nof the term, more warmly than any other in human and comparative\r\nanatomy, the obvious difference just pointed out ought not to have been\r\npassed over. It was the more incumbent on one pronouncing on the\r\nparamount problem, because the \"sagittal ridge in the gorilla,\" as in\r\nthe orang, relates to and signifies the dental character which\r\ndifferentiates all _Quadrumana_ from all _Bimana_ that have ever come\r\nunder the ken of the biologist. And this ridge much more \"strikingly\r\nsuggests\" the fierceness of the powerful brute-ape than the part\r\nreferred to as \"large bosses.\" Frontal prominences, more truly so\r\ntermed, are even better developed in peaceful, timid, graminivorous\r\nquadrupeds than in the skulls of man or of ape. But before noticing the\r\nevidence which the teeth bear on the physical relations of man to brute,\r\nI would premise that the comparison must not be limited to a part or\r\n\"fragment\" of the bony frame, but to its totality, as relating to the\r\nmodes and faculties of locomotion.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the skull--and, indeed, for present aim, limiting myself\r\nthereto--I have found that a vertical longitudinal section brings to\r\nlight in greatest number and of truest value the differential characters\r\nbetween lowest _Homo_ and highest _Simia_. Those truly and indifferently\r\ninterested in the question may not think it unworthy their time--if it\r\nhas not already been so bestowed--to give attention to the detailed\r\ndiscussions and illustrations of the characters in question in the\r\nsecond and third volumes of the \"Transactions of the Zoological\r\nSociety.\"[2] The concluding memoir, relating more especially to points\r\nof approximation in cranial and denial structure of the highest\r\n_Quadrumane_ to the lowest _Bimane_, has been separately published.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: \"Oseteological Contributions to the Natural History\r\n    of the Orangs (_Pithecus_) and Chimpanzees (_Troglodites niger_\r\n    and _Trog. gorilla_).\"]\r\n\r\nI selected from the large and instructive series of human skulls of\r\nvarious races in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons that which\r\nwas the lowest, and might be called most bestial, in its cranial and\r\ndental characters. It was from an adult of that human family of which\r\nthe life-characters are chiefly but truly and suggestively defined in\r\nthe narrative of Cook's first voyage in the Endeavor.[3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: Hawkesworth's 4th ed., vol. iii., 1770, pp. 86,\r\n    137, 229. The skull in question is No 5,394 of the \"Catalogue of\r\n    the Osteology\" in the above Museum, 4to, vol. ii, p. 823, 1853.]\r\n\r\nNot to trespass further on the patience of my readers, I may refer to\r\nthe \"Memoir on the Gorilla,\" 4to, 1865. Plate xii. gives a view, natural\r\nsize, of the vertical and longitudinal section of an Australian skull;\r\nplate xi. gives a similar view of the skull of the gorilla. Reduced\r\ncopies of these views may be found at p. 572, figs. 395, 396, vol. ii,\r\nof my \"Anatomy of Vertebrates.\"\r\n\r\nAs far as my experience has reached, there is no skull displaying the\r\ncharacters of a quadrumanous species, as that series descends from the\r\ngorilla and chimpanzee to the baboon, which exhibits differences, osteal\r\nor dental, on which specific and generic distinctions are founded, so\r\ngreat, so marked, as are to be seen, and have been above illustrated, in\r\nthe comparison of the highest ape with the lowest man.\r\n\r\nThe modification of man's upper limbs for the endless variety, nicety,\r\nand perfection of their application, in fulfillment of the behests of\r\nhis correspondingly developed brain--actions summed up in the term\r\n\"manipulation\"--testify as strongly to the same conclusion. The\r\ncorresponding degree of modification of the human lower limbs, to which\r\nhe owes his upright attitude, relieving the manual instruments from all\r\nshare in station and terrestrial locomotion--combine and concur in\r\nraising the group so characterized above and beyond the apes, to, at\r\nleast, ordinal distinction. The dental characters of mankind bear like\r\ntestimony. The lowest (Melanian), like the highest (Caucasian), variety\r\nof the bimanal order differs from the quadrumanal one in the order of\r\nappearance, and succession to the first set of teeth, of the second or\r\n\"permanent\" set. The foremost incisor and foremost molar are the\r\nearliest to appear in that scries; the intermediate teeth are acquired\r\nsooner than those behind the foremost molar.[4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: \"Odontography,\" 4to, 1840-44, p. 454, plates 117,\r\n    118, 119.]\r\n\r\nIn the gorilla and chimpanzee, the rate or course of progress is\r\nreversed; the second true molar, or the one behind the first, makes its\r\nappearance before the bicuspid molars rise in front of the first; and\r\nthe third or last of the molars behind the first comes into place before\r\nthe canine tooth has risen. This tooth, indeed, which occupies part of\r\nthe interval between the foremost incisor and foremost molar, is the\r\nlast of the permanent set of teeth to be fully developed in the\r\n_Quadrumana_; especially in those which, in their order, rank next to\r\nthe _Bimana_. To this differential character add the breaks in the\r\ndental series necessitated for the reception of the crowns of the huge\r\ncanines when the gorilla or chimpanzee shuts its mouth.\r\n\r\nBut the superior value of developmental over adult anatomical characters\r\nin such questions as the present is too well known in the actual phase\r\nof biology to need comment.\r\n\r\nIn the article on \"Primeval Man,\" the author states that the Cave-men\r\n\"probably had lower foreheads, with high bosses like the Neanderthal\r\nskull, and big canine teeth like the Naulette jaw.\"[5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: _Fortnightly Review_, September, p. 321.]\r\n\r\nThe human lower jaw so defined, from a Belgian cave, which I have\r\ncarefully examined, gives no evidence of a canine tooth of a size\r\nindicative of one in the upper jaw necessitating such vacancy in the\r\nlower series of teeth which the apes present. There is no such vacancy\r\nnor any evidence of a \"big canine tooth\" in that cave specimen. And,\r\nwith respect to cave specimens in general, the zoological characters of\r\nthe race of men they represent must be founded on the rule, not on an\r\nexception, to their cranial features. Those which I obtained from the\r\ncavern at Bruniquel, and which are now exhibited in the Museum of\r\nNatural History, were disinterred under circumstances more\r\nsatisfactorily determining their contemporaneity with the extinct\r\nquadrupeds those cave-men killed and devoured than in any other spelaean\r\nretreat which I have explored. They show neither \"lower foreheads\" nor\r\n\"higher bosses\" than do the skulls of existing races of mankind.\r\n\r\nPresent evidence concurs in concluding that the modes of life and grades\r\nof thought of the men who have left evidences of their existence at the\r\nearliest periods hitherto discovered and determined, were such as are\r\nnow observable in \"savages,\" or the human races which are commonly so\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nThe industry and pains now devoted to the determination of the physical\r\ncharacters of such races, to their ways of living, their tools and\r\nweapons, and to the relations of their dermal, osteal, and dental\r\nmodifications to those of the mammals which follow next after _Bimana_\r\nin the descensive series of mammalian orders, are exemplary.\r\n\r\nThe present phase of the quest may be far from the bourn to yield\r\nhereafter trustworthy evidence of the origin of man; but, meanwhile,\r\nexaggerations and misstatements of acquired grounds ought especially to\r\nbe avoided.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ABA OR ODIKA.\r\n\r\nBy W.H. BACHELER, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many luxuriant and magnificent forest trees of equatorial West\r\nAfrica, none can surpass, for general beauty and symmetry, that which is\r\ncalled by the natives the \"aba.\" When growing alone and undisturbed, its\r\nconical outline and dark green foliage remind one very much of the white\r\nmaples of the northern United States, by a distant view, but, on a\r\nnearer approach, a dissimilarity is observed. Wherever, in ravines or\r\nnear the banks of rivers, the soil is moist the most part of the year,\r\nthere the aba chooses to grow, and during the months of June and July\r\nthe falling fruits permeate the atmosphere with a delicious fragrance\r\nnot similar to any other. This, in form, size, and general appearance,\r\nis very much like mango apples, so that the natives call mangoes the\r\n\"white man's aba;\" but the wild aba is not much eaten as a fruit, one or\r\ntwo being sufficient for the whole season. The kernel, or seed, is the\r\nimportant and useful part.\r\n\r\nWhen the fallen fruit covers the ground, much as apples do in America,\r\nthe natives go in canoes to gather it, and the number harvested will be\r\nin proportion to the industry of the women. The aba plum is about the\r\nsize of a goose's egg, of a flattened, ovoid shape, and, when ripe, a\r\nbeautiful golden color. It consists of three distinct parts: the rind,\r\nthe pulp, and the seed. The pulp consists of a mass extensively\r\ninterwoven with strong filaments, which apparently grow out of the seed\r\nand are with great difficulty separated from it. The seed, reniform in\r\nshape, is bivalved, and constitutes about two-thirds of the bulk of the\r\nentire plum, and the inner kernel two-thirds the bulk of the seed.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of it being such a high tree and growing in such\r\ninconvenient places, I have been unable to procure a specimen of the\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the fruit is brought to the village, all the inhabitants\r\nassemble with cutlasses and engage in the work of opening the plums and\r\nremoving the kernels. The former are thrown away as useless. The seeds\r\nare evenly spread on the top of a rack of small sticks, under which a\r\nfire is built in the morning, and subjected to the smoke and heat of an\r\nentire day. Toward evening the heat is greatly augmented, and in a\r\ncouple of hours the process is completed. The kernels are now soft, and\r\nthe oil oozing from them, and while yet in this condition they are\r\nthrown into an immense trough and throughly beaten and mashed with a\r\npestle.\r\n\r\nBaskets, with banana leaves spread in the inside to prevent the escape\r\nof the product, are in readiness, and it is put into them and pressed\r\ndown. The next day these baskets are suspended in the sun, and at night\r\nare brought into the houses to congeal. The process is now finished. The\r\ncakes are removed by inversion of the baskets and \"bushrope\" tied around\r\nthem, by which the pieces are carried. As thus prepared, odika is highly\r\nesteemed by the natives as an article of food, being made into a kind of\r\nthick gravy and eaten with boiled plantains.\r\n\r\nWhile at an interior mission station on the Ogowe River, I made some\r\nexperiments in soap making. With palm oil I succeeded very well, using\r\nfor an alkali the old-fashioned lye of ashes. But I was disappointed\r\nwith the odika, though I learned some peculiar characteristics of it as\r\na grease. By boiling the crude odika, I was unable, as I hoped, to\r\nseparate the oleaginous from the extraneous matter, of which it contains\r\na large proportion, but when the above-mentioned lye was used instead of\r\nwater, the mass, instead of saponifying, merely separated; the grease,\r\nresembling very much in all particulars ordinary beef tallow, rising to\r\nthe top of the caldron, while the refuse was precipitated.\r\n\r\nAfter clarifying this, it answers instead of oil of theobroma very\r\nnicely, and I have used it considerably in making ointments and\r\nsuppositories with pleasing results.\r\n\r\nGaboon, W.

It is eminently noted for great\r\nrapidity of growth, wonderful lightness, stiffness, and extraordinary\r\ndurability. A thousand uses have sprung up and are multiplying around\r\nthis interesting cedar as its most inestimable qualities become better\r\nknown. Fortunately it is one of the most extensively distributed trees\r\nof the Pacific--found from the coast range north, south to San Diego,\r\nSierra Nevada, southern Oregon, and most of the interior mountain region\r\nfrom 2,000 to 4,000 feet, and it even thrives quite well at 6,600 feet\r\naltitude, but seeming to give out at 7,000 feet, though said to extend\r\nto 8,500 feet, which is questionable. As usual with the sylva, flora,\r\nand fauna, this also is found lowest along the coast, where it finds the\r\nrequisite temperature and other essentials, with combined moisture. The\r\nbase and lower trunk somewhat resembles the Western juniper (_J.\r\noccidentalis_). It is to be noted in general that trees of such broad,\r\noutwardly sweeping, or expanded bases seldom blow over, and to the\r\nperceptive and artistic eye their significant character is one of\r\nfirmness and stability. One hundred to two hundred feet high, six to\r\nnine feet in diameter (rarely larger) the shaft is often clear of limbs\r\n80 to 100 feet, and although the lower limbs, or even dry branches, may\r\nencumber the middle portion, pin-knots do not damage the timber. The\r\nmassive body tapers more rapidly above than redwood, and is less\r\neccentric than juniper, yet its general port resembles most the best\r\nspecimens of the latter. The light cinnamon bark is thick and of\r\nshreddy-fibered texture, but so concretely compacted as to render the\r\nsurface evenly ridged by very long, big bars of bark. These sweep\r\nobliquely down on the long spiral twist of swift water lines. The top is\r\nconic, the foliage is in compressed, flattened sprays, upright,\r\nthickened, and somewhat succulent; if not a languid type, at least in no\r\nsense rigid. It bears some resemblance to the great Western arborvitae\r\n(_Thuja gigantea_), but the tiny leaf-scales are opposite and quite\r\nawl-pointed. The general hue of the foliage is light yellowish green,\r\nwarmly tinted, golden and bead tipped, with tiny, oblong male catkins,\r\nas the fruit ripens in October and November. The cones are pendulous\r\nfrom the tips of twigs, oblong, and seldom over three-quarters of an\r\ninch long, little more than one-third as thick, and for the most part a\r\ntrifle compressed. The wood is a pale cream-tint in color--a delicate\r\nsalmon shade. This would hardly warrant the name white cedar, sometimes\r\napplied to it, as well as the giant arborvitae. The extreme lightness of\r\nthe lumber and its sweetness for packing boxes will commend it for\r\nexpress and commercial purposes, for posts and fencing, and especially\r\nrailway ties, for sleepers, stringers, and ground timbers of all\r\nvarieties, and for unnumbered uses, a tithe of which cannot be told in a\r\nbrief notice. Formerly these trees were cut away and burned up, to clear\r\nthe track for redwood, tamarack, and ponderous pith-pines, etc.; now all\r\nelse is superseded by this incense cedar. Thus is seen how hasty and\r\nill-advised notions give place to genuine merit.\r\n\r\nA fungus (_daedalus_) attacks and honeycombs it; and riddled as it may\r\noccasionally be, still, if spike or nail finds substance enough to hold,\r\nor sufficient solidity to resist crushing, then, for many purposes, even\r\nsuch lumber is practically as good as the soundest timber; because when\r\nthe tree dies the fungus dies, and thenceforth will absorb no more\r\nmoisture than the soundest part, and is alike imperishable, contrary to\r\ncommon experience in similar cases. This is a timber nearly as lasting\r\nas solid granite. For ship or boat lumber, the clear stuff from sound\r\nwood is so exceedingly light, stiff, and durable, and so plenty and\r\navailable, that few timbers excel it, unless the yellow cedar or cyprus\r\n(_Cupressus nutkaensis_) is excepted, which is a little tougher,\r\nstronger, perhaps more elastic, and equally durable, if judged apart\r\nfrom thorough tests and careful data, which, it has been remarked, the\r\napathy or ignorance of some governments appear to deem unworthy their\r\nsublime attention. There are said to be in California a thousand times\r\nmore and better kinds of naval timbers on government lands as important\r\nto preserve as the live oaks of the South Atlantic States. It has been\r\nasserted as probable that, after due investigation, California would be\r\nfound to possess a vast amount of the best naval timber in the world, a\r\nhundredfold more lasting than the best now in use, if a few woods are\r\nexcepted, of which there is understood to be no very adequate supply.\r\n\r\nThe great Washington cedar (_Sequoia gigantea_) is another important\r\nCalifornia tree. The great sequoian timber belt lies along the Sierras,\r\nupon the first exposed mountain side--moraines of recent retiring\r\nglaciers--that face the Pacific, from Calaveras on the north to near the\r\nhead of Deer Creek on the south--a distance of 200 miles, or a little\r\nabove 38 degrees north to a little below 36 degrees; altitude 5,000 to\r\n8,000 feet, and rarely 8,400 feet. The belt is broken by two gaps, each\r\n40 miles wide, caused by manifest topographical and glacial reasons, one\r\ngap between Calaveras and Tuolumne, the other between Fresno and King's\r\nRiver; thence the vast forest trends south, across the broad basins of\r\nKaweah and Tule, a distance of 70 miles, on fresh moraine soil, ground\r\nfrom high mountain flanks by glaciers. The inscriptions are scarcely\r\nmarred by post glacial agents, and the contiguous water-worn marks are\r\noften so slight in the rock-bound streams as to be measured by a few\r\ninches. Rarely does one of these sound and vigorous cedars fall, and\r\nthose that do will lie 800 to 1,000 years, scarcely less perishable than\r\nthe granite on which they grew. The great sequoian ditches, dug at a\r\nblow by their fall, and the tree tumuli, always turned up beside the\r\ndeep root-bowls, remain; but, scientists assert, not a vestige of one\r\noutside the present forests has yet presented itself, hence the area has\r\nnot been diminished during the last 8,000 or 10,000 years, and probably\r\nnot at all in post glacial times. These colossal sequoias rise 275, 300,\r\nand even 400 feet aloft; are 20 to 30, and in some rare cases 40 feet in\r\ndiameter, looking like vast columnar pillars of the skies. No known\r\ntrees of the world compare with them and their kin, the redwoods, for\r\nthe focused proximity of such a marvelous amount of timber within\r\nlimited areas--as it were, the highest standard of timber-land capacity.\r\nThe stage coach passes through one; 120 children and a piano crowd\r\ninside another; a trunk furnishes a house for cotillon parties to dance\r\n\"stout on stumps;\" a horse and rider travel within the burnt-out hollows\r\nof others, and so on. A single tree would furnish a two-rail fence, 20\r\nto 30 miles long. The tree has great value for wood and lumber.--_N.W.\r\nLumberman._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA catalogue containing brief notices of many important\r\nscientific papers heretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT,\r\nmay be had gratis at this office.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe\r\nSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY.\r\n\r\nTERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION, $5 A YEAR.\r\n\r\nSent by mail, postage prepaid, to subscribers in any part of the United\r\nStates or Canada.
