I. PHILADELPHIA, _Seventh Month_, 1820.  _No. 7._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE TEACHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the smooth faced urchins that were subject to my little\r\nkingdom about fifteen years ago, was a tall awkward boy, named\r\nJonathan Gull. Jonathan was the son of an honest hard working\r\nfarmer, who lived about two miles from the village, and who had\r\nby dint of frugality, acquired some property, and with it a\r\nproportional degree of consideration in the eyes of his neighbours.\r\nHis crops of wheat were generally large, and he made a journey to\r\nthe metropolis once a year, to dispose of his grain and produce.\r\nOn these occasions his wife and a grown up daughter would usually\r\naccompany him to see the city and to buy cheap goods. It did one's\r\nheart good to witness the return of the honest farmer--the smile of\r\nself-complacency with which he greeted the members of his family,\r\nand the eagerness with which he inquired respecting the farm, Old\r\nRoan, and the young colt, and brindle, the cow, and the litter of\r\nyoung pigs; and the air of importance which he assumed towards his\r\nneighbours, who thronged around him to hear the latest news-what\r\nBoney was doing--the yellow fever--and the price of wheat. His\r\nhearty greeting of his acquaintance; the animation which sparkled\r\nin his sunburnt face; his short thick set figure, decked out in a\r\nsuit of homespun grey, with large brass buttons; his arms a kimbo;\r\nand the broad burst of merriment, that, amidst the discussion of\r\ngraver subjects, occasionally broke forth at some sly turn, or\r\nsecond hand joke of the traveller; altogether formed the beau ideal\r\nof homely rustic happiness, and prosperity. Nor was the greeting and\r\nexcitation less on the part of the wife and daughter. As the wagon\r\nwas emptied of its load, treasure after treasure met the eyes of the\r\ndelighted group of children and neighbours. Here were a new set of\r\nmilk pans, and a churn for the dairy; a dozen of pewter spoons, as\r\nsmooth and as bright as silver, and scrubbing brushes, and knives\r\nand forks to repair the waste of years. There glittered lots of new\r\ncalico, as fine as red and yellow could make them; papers of pins\r\nand needles, and all the sundry articles which complete the stock\r\nof an industrious housewife; while in another place were cautiously\r\nhid, lest they should excite undue envy, the silver teaspoons and\r\nteapot, and the bundles of coffee and tea and white sugar, together\r\nwith the tortoise shell combs and gold ear-rings which the good\r\nnatured husband had been importuned to buy. Let not the reader\r\nturn away with contempt from this simple picture; the event was an\r\nimportant one in the family of farmer Gull, and supplied it with a\r\nstock, not only of necessities and luxuries, but of conversation\r\nand pleasure for a full season. But alas! in the train of all this\r\nprosperity and gladness marched the forerunners of decay. Farmer\r\nGull's heavy purse of shining dollars had won the heart of many a\r\nknight of the counter, and many were the plans laid to obtain a a\r\ncloser intimacy with their owner. Here Mrs. Gull was invited to sit\r\ndown in the parlour to rest herself; and there was she pressed to\r\nstay to tea. One talked to her about her butter and her cheese, and\r\nanother about her rosy faced children. In short, it so happened,\r\nthat in the course of a few years, she had at least half a dozen\r\nacquaintances in the shopkeeping line, each of whom were under\r\nengagement to spend a short time during the Dog-days at Melrose;\r\nfor so was the farm now styled. With these new acquaintances, new\r\nviews and expectations filled the minds of the wife and daughters.\r\nThe old family Bible and the Pilgrim's Progress were less frequently\r\nread and quoted; the calico short gowns in which they used to visit\r\ntheir neighbours of a summer evening gave place to dresses of silk\r\nand white muslin, and their talk was now of the fashions and the new\r\nnovels. Among other changes it was determined to make a merchant\r\nof Jonathan, and a place was accordingly engaged for him with the\r\nparticular friend of the family, Mr. Seersucker.----I was struck\r\nwith the appearance of the lad when he came to bid me good bye\r\nand take his books from school. He was dressed in a suit of tidy\r\nhomespun, made up by the hands of his mother and sisters, and which\r\nwas, from the sheep that furnished the wool to the thread with which\r\nthe garments were sewed, the produce of his father's farm. The good\r\nold fashioned notions of domestic industry were not then extinct.\r\nOur farmers had not then found that it was cheaper to keep a family\r\nof strapping daughters idle at home, and send the wool to one\r\nfactory to be carded and spun, and to another to be wove and dyed,\r\nand then to a fop of a tailor to be made up into coats, than to have\r\nthe cards, the wheel, and the loom at their own fire-side; giving\r\nwholesome occupation to their family, enlivening the gloomy hours of\r\nwinter, and cementing by good humour and mutual assistance the ties\r\nof family and kindred. We had not then found out the grand modern\r\nsecret of economy; that it is better to pamper a few inordinate\r\nmanufacturing establishments, with all their consequences, of a\r\ndegraded and dependant population and high taxes, than to let every\r\nindividual pursue his own interests, and to encourage that best\r\nof domestic manufactures where the workshop is the kitchen of the\r\nfarmer, and his wife and children the contented and uncorrupted\r\nlabourers.\r\n\r\nBut I find myself perpetually digressing from my story, and must\r\nbid a truce to these rambling thoughts. Jonathan, as I was saying,\r\nwas tidily dressed; his hair was combed smooth on his forehead,\r\nand hanging long behind, and the awkwardness of his figure, was\r\nscarcely apparent in the expression of good health and contentment\r\nthat animated him. It soon became apparent, however, that citizen\r\nJonathan would not long be contented with his homely garb. At his\r\nfirst visit home I observed that he had been in the hands of a\r\nfashionable hair-dresser, who had given him the true Bonapartean\r\ntopknot. His shirt collar was stretched up till it half covered\r\nhis ears and cheeks, and he sported a clouded and twisted cane,\r\nwhile the remainder of his dress was yet unchanged. By degrees the\r\nexuvia of the clown fell off, as I have seen a snake in the spring\r\nslowly emerge from the shrivelled skin which she has cast, or as\r\na locust may sometimes be seen breaking through his faded coat\r\nof mail and sporting in gaudy robes of green and gold; or as you\r\nmay observe in the ponds a kind of doubtful animal, half frog and\r\nhalf tadpole. Jonathan became in a year or two the admiration of\r\nall the neighbouring milk maids, and was universally accounted a\r\nfine gentleman. He had not be sure ciphered further than Practice,\r\nand was but a dull hand, when a boy, at Murray's grammar; but so\r\nwonderfully had a city life sharpened his wits, that his old master\r\nhimself was quite in the back ground when Jonathan was present; he\r\npoured forth such a torrent of words and discoursed so fluently\r\nabout politics and trade and great men. Then came the days of\r\ndelusion and speculation. Jonathan was now of age, and as he had\r\nwhat was called a good turn for business, and a strong back to\r\nsupport him, he was solicited to engage in trade. A partnership was\r\naccordingly formed, and \"GULL, SNIPE, & Co.\" glittered in golden\r\ncapitals across Market Street. A capital of some thousands was paid\r\ndown, while goods to the amount of hundreds of thousands were bought\r\nand sold.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime farmer Gull was floating on the very spring tide of\r\nprosperity. His wealth, which was yearly increasing, gave him great\r\nweight in the neighbourhood; he was made overseer of the poor, and\r\nthere was a talk of sending him to Congress. When that ill starred\r\nmeasure which created at a birth a swarm of banks, more greedy and\r\nmore lean than Pharaoh's kine, was adopted, farmer Gull partook of\r\nthe delusion. He was made a director of the bank of Potosi, which\r\nwas located in our village, and from that moment gave himself up to\r\ndreams of imaginary wealth. He stocked his farm with merino sheep,\r\nat an average of fifty dollars a head, and calculated that in six\r\nyears he should double his money. Six years have elapsed, and farmer\r\nGull's whole flock will not now sell for the cost of a single ewe.\r\nHe mortgaged his farm to the bank, that he might buy a neighbouring\r\nproperty, and prosecute some expensive improvements in the way of\r\nmills and factories. At home every thing was changed. Mistress Gull\r\nrode to church in a handsome carriage, which Jonathan had sent up\r\nfrom town; and Polly and Biddy, instead of being at the milk pail by\r\nsunrise, lay abed till breakfast time and then came down with pale\r\nand languid countenances, and their hair buckled into \"kill-beaus\"\r\nand \"heart breakers,\" to partake of coffee which unnerved their\r\nsystem, and rendered them feverish and nervous till dinner time.\r\nWhy should I proceed with my story? The sequel may be read in the\r\npresent circumstances of many a once thriving family. The lean kine\r\nof Simon devoured his fat kine, and distress and confusion covered\r\nthe face of the country. Gull, Snipe, & Co., after a few years of\r\nfictitious prosperity, and proportional extravagance, went the way\r\nof half Market Street. Farmer Gull was their security, and had to\r\nmake heavy payments to the bank. His own speculations had proved\r\nruinous, the clouds became continually darker and thicker around\r\nhim, and have at length burst upon his head. His whole property\r\nis insufficient to pay the mortgages, and his stock and furniture\r\nwill be sold next week by the sheriff. Such is the termination of\r\nfarmer Gull's career. His family is incapacitated for its present\r\ndestitute situation, and has lost the inclination and the power of\r\nbeing frugal: he himself, I observe, bears his troubles with an\r\nappearance of unusual fortitude. He preserves his cheerful spirits,\r\nand has become the life of a circle of embarrassed farmers that\r\nfrequent a tavern opposite the window of my study. I see him there\r\ndaily--sometimes to be sure moody and disconsolate, but more often\r\nleading the chorus of some Bacchanalian song, or retailing the merry\r\njests of some quondam acquaintance, of a lawyer, or bank director.\r\nAlas! for my countrymen;--when shall we see again the days of\r\nhonest dealing, sturdy frugality, unsophisticated manners, and\r\nhousehold industry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE DESULTORY REMARKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. VI.\r\n\r\n    I've felt full many a heart-ach in my day,\r\n      At the mere rustling of a muslin gown,\r\n    And caught some dreadful colds, I blush to say,\r\n      While shivering in the shade of beauty's frown.\r\n    They say her smiles are sunbeams--it may be--\r\n    But never a sunbeam would she throw on me.\r\n\r\nIt has been said by a writer, whose genius and scholarship are in\r\nthe highest degree honourable to his country, that our Parnassus is\r\nfruitful only in weeds, or at best in underwood. Notwithstanding the\r\ngeneral correctness of this assertion, a modest wild-flower now and\r\nthen delights the eye, and points that rainbow adventurer HOPE to\r\nthe brilliant future; in which some master of song shall disclose in\r\na broad and clear light,\r\n\r\n  _Such forms as glitter in the Muse's ray._\r\n\r\nAmerican literature, it must be admitted, is comparatively feeble\r\nin many of its branches; but while the names of FRANKLIN and RUSH,\r\nDENNIE and BROWN, of WALSH and IRVING, are remembered, it is\r\nentitled to the respectful consideration, even of foreign criticism.\r\n\r\nThe extract given above is made from a writer, who has furnished\r\nsome evidence of poetic talent in sundry occasional playful pieces,\r\npublished originally in the New York Evening Post, under the\r\nsignature of CROAKER & Co. However unprepossessing may be the name\r\nwhich he has chosen to assume, his notes instead of reminding us, as\r\nmight be inferred, of the frog or the raven; at times successfully\r\nrival those of the favourite songsters of the grove. From this\r\nstanza, we learn that the author is a BACHELOR; who like too many\r\nof his brethren, delights to dwell on the fancied cruelty of the\r\nfair; and to pour the unheeded complaints of his sorrows on the\r\ndull and listless ear of indifference. To this portion of society,\r\nlittle commisseration is extended from any quarter; and the general\r\nsentiment is responsive to that contained in the following couplet\r\nof POPE:\r\n\r\n    _Let sinful bachelors their woes deplore;\r\n    Full well they merit all they feel and more._\r\n\r\nUnpopular as such a doctrine might appear, this condition of life\r\nhas had its advocates and defenders. Amongst these may be placed\r\nthat truly great man, the eloquent and accomplished apostle PAUL.\r\nWhen adverting to this subject, he discovers something of an\r\nunsocial disposition where he says, \"For I would that all men were\r\neven as myself.\"[1] \"But I speak this by permission, and not of\r\ncommandment,\" says he, as if fearful that speculative opinion might\r\nbe received from the weight of his character as authority perfectly\r\nvalid and conclusive. DRYDEN has asserted, that \"a true painter\r\nnaturally delights in the liberty which belongs to the bachelor's\r\nestate.\" However specious this position may appear, the liberal arts\r\nare more indebted to the charities of life, and to the influence\r\nof female excellence, than the author of such a sentiment would be\r\nwilling to admit. A vivid perception of physical and moral beauty,\r\ndelicacy of feeling, and intellectual refinement, are indispensably\r\nrequisite in the artist who aspires to eminence in his profession.\r\nNothing has a more direct and efficient tendency to promote elegance\r\nand correctness of taste than the society of enlightened and\r\npolished females. The absence of care is another immunity which the\r\nBACHELOR is said to enjoy; but this as well as other assumptions in\r\nhis favour, but serves to illustrate the fact, that on almost any\r\nsubject whatever, to use the language of Sir ROGER DE COVERLY, much\r\nmay be said on both sides.\"\r\n\r\n  [1] 1 Cor. chap. 7.\r\n\r\nIn all ages there have been from various causes, a formidable array\r\nof individuals of this class. The circumstances connected with the\r\npresent times are, unfortunately, well calculated to increase their\r\nnumber. To the usual disastrous consequences produced by \"beauty's\r\nfrown,\" the disappointments and gloomy prospects in business, deep\r\nrooted habits of idleness and extravagance, by which the present\r\nperiod is peculiarly distinguished, may also be added. Active\r\nindustry, frugality, and temperance, should be sedulously cultivated\r\nas moral virtues; having a most important agency in augmenting the\r\nstock of individual, social, and political happiness. But unamiable\r\nand repulsive as the character of a BACHELOR may too frequently be,\r\nis it necessarily so?\r\n\r\nCan he contemplate the condition of childhood, surrounded with the\r\npallid spectres of poverty, and shooting forth luxuriantly into all\r\nthe noxious forms of ignorance and vice;--can he walk our streets or\r\nwharves when his ear is saluted with their lisping imprecations;--or\r\nwitness their utter disregard of the duties which appertain to the\r\nSabbath,--without seriously interrogating his own bosom--In what way\r\ncan any exertions of mine improve their condition, and promote their\r\ntrue interests?\r\n\r\nCan he behold the increase of intemperance and crime in all the\r\nramifications of society, without feeling the influence of those\r\nsacred ties which bind him to that community of which he is a\r\nmember; and without resolving to use all diligence to arrest their\r\nfurther extension, so far as his influence and example may reach?\r\n\r\nCan he listen with unconcern to the cries of oppressed humanity, and\r\nview without emotion, those objects of wretchedness which almost\r\ndaily present themselves in the most affecting shapes, and forget\r\nthe intimate relationship, and the reciprocity of duties which exist\r\nbetween every branch of the human family, and the justice and force\r\nof the claims of distress upon every generous and sympathetic heart?\r\n\r\nHe can no where in the moral or physical economy of the world, find\r\nan example of existences which are independent of all connection\r\nwith the present, past, and future. The universe has been with great\r\npropriety compared to a complex machine, \"a stupendous whole,\" every\r\npart of which has its relative and proper function to perform, and\r\ndiscord and confusion are the consequence of each irregularity of\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n    From Nature's chain whatever link you strike,\r\n    Tenth, or ten thousandth breaks the chain alike.\r\n\r\nIt should be the business of _every one_ to cultivate such\r\nsentiments as those which are contained in the extract below,\r\ngiven from a work[2] which the celebrated DUGALD STEWART declared\r\nwhen presenting a copy of it to one of our countrymen, now a\r\nresident of Philadelphia, to be the finest piece of composition in\r\nthe English language: \"_That to feel much for others, and little\r\nfor ourselves, that to restrain our selfish, and to indulge our\r\nbenevolent affections, constitutes the perfection of human nature;\r\nand can alone produce among mankind that harmony of sentiments and\r\npassions in which consists their whole grace and propriety._\" Even\r\na BACHELOR, actuated by principles of this character, might emerge\r\ninto the character of a worthy, useful, and amiable man! ☞\r\n\r\n  [2] \"Theory of Moral Sentiments,\" by ADAM SMITH, author of the\r\n  \"Wealth of Nations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtracts from C. E.'s Common-Place Book.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Cheap food for horses, from M'Arthur's Financial Facts, 8vo. p.\r\n     258._\r\n\r\nThe author lived in London and kept three horses which he fed as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nTwo trusses and a half of clover or meadow hay cut and mixed with\r\nfour trusses of wheat, or barley straw, when cut up, make nearly\r\nequal quantities in weight; two heaped bushels of this mixture equal\r\nto fourteen pounds weight, are given to each horse in twenty-four\r\nhours, being previously mixed with half a peck of corn, (in England\r\noats) ground or chopped, weight 5_lbs._ with water to wet it; that\r\nis, 7 pounds of hay; 7 pounds of straw; 5 pounds of meal; given at\r\nsix different times, each day and evening. Add 5 pounds of hay at\r\nnight, makes 24 pounds to each horse in twenty-four hours; and it\r\nkept them much fatter than with double the corn each day unground,\r\ntwo trusses of hay a week.\r\n\r\nAn ox, unworked, eats about 32 pounds of meadow hay per day.\r\n\r\nAn ox at work eats 40 pounds a day.\r\n\r\nIf fed in the stable each head of horned cattle will eat 130 pounds\r\ngreen clover just cut, or 30 pounds clover hay a day.\r\n\r\nAt work, 3 horses eat in all, 48 stones a week of hay, also 48\r\nquarts of oats a week each horse.\r\n\r\nAt work 18 horses in 12 days, eat 430 stones of hay, which is 14\r\nstones a week for each horse, also 64 quarts of oats a week for each.\r\n\r\nAn idle horse eat 14 stones of hay a week and no corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Native Grape Vine._\r\n\r\n\r\n  AUGUST 22, 1807.\r\n\r\nIn the garden of Joseph Cooper, Esq. of New Jersey, just opposite to\r\nPhiladelphia, is one grape vine which with its branches, covers 2170\r\nsquare feet of ground. On this one vine are now grapes supposed to\r\nbe forty bushels, and probably much more. It produced last year one\r\nbarrel of wine, which was made without sugar, and is judged to be\r\nquite as good as Madeira of the same age, by a man brought up in the\r\nMadeira wine trade. Under this vine the ground produced a good crop\r\nof grass this season. It is a native American vine, transplanted\r\nfrom that same neighbourhood.[3]\r\n\r\n  [3] A short time before the decease of this very respectable\r\n  agriculturalist, I had the pleasure of a visit from him, I believe\r\n  in the year 1815; when I remarked, I had heard much about his\r\n  celebrated vine from other people, and I now wished some account\r\n  of it from himself. He informed me, (and I put his statement in\r\n  writing) that the year previous, he had taken from this vine 40\r\n  bushels of grapes, which weighed 2000_lbs._, from which was made\r\n  upwards of 100 gallons of wine, the pure juice of the grape; without\r\n  either water or sugar, or any admixture whatever. The vine and its\r\n  branches covered the eighteenth part of an acre. Now according to\r\n  our friend C. E.'s mode of calculation, which is rather too sanguine\r\n  for practical men, if an eighteenth part produce 100 gallons, a\r\n  whole acre of course would produce 1800 gallons. It continues to\r\n  flourish, and bore last year the usual quantity of grapes. Though\r\n  this is an extraordinary vine, and has received more attention than\r\n  could be given to any large number by a common sized family, yet it\r\n  evidently shows the cultivation of this description of vine might be\r\n  made productive.\r\n\r\n  Every farmer in the middle and southern states might, if he chose,\r\n  have such a vine; or at least ten or more smaller ones, which would\r\n  yield as much, and without any material expense. If this were the\r\n  case, wine would be so plentiful and so cheap, that every labouring\r\n  man might have it as a pleasant, cheering and invigorating beverage,\r\n  and would do more to extinguish the hateful vice of drunkenness than\r\n  perhaps any other agent within our control.\r\n\r\n  This sentiment is corroborated by the fact, that in the vine\r\n  countries of France, where weak wines are as abundant as cider,\r\n  in a plentiful season in Pennsylvania, and where all, poor and\r\n  rich, drink of them freely, there is comparatively no drunkenness.\r\n  The writer of this note, some years ago, travelled in France in\r\n  different directions about 1200 miles; and took notice in the\r\n  whole journey of but two drunken men, and excepting three or four\r\n  instances, always had his accommodations at an inn, the most likely\r\n  place to find intemperance. As you go northward into the colder\r\n  countries of Holland and the north of Germany, where the vine cannot\r\n  be cultivated but with great difficulty, and wine is too high priced\r\n  to be commonly used, you may observe the progress of drunkenness\r\n  almost by the degrees of latitude. Immediately previous to this\r\n  journey in France, I spent several months in Germany, where I drank\r\n  coffee regularly twice a day, and was afflicted almost daily with\r\n  headach. In France, where I seldom used coffee, but frequently weak\r\n  wine at breakfast, as well as at other times, I had no headach.\r\n  Should this be generally the effect, it would be another reason\r\n  in favour of cultivating the vine in the United States. I am no\r\n  friend to wine bibbers, nor would I be willing to encourage in the\r\n  remotest degree the use of inebriating liquors, but I should like\r\n  very much to see a vine such as Joseph Cooper's on every farm in our\r\n  country.--ED.\r\n\r\nIf 2170 square feet produced 32 gallons, then one acre which is\r\n43,560 square feet would produce about 20 barrels, or 640 gallons\r\nbut allowing space for avenues, say about 15 barrels, or 480 gallons.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the crop of grapes for 1807 will produce much\r\nmore than those of 1806.\r\n\r\n  One acre yielding 480 gallons,\r\n  at $1.00, is - - - $480.00\r\n  at $1.50, is - - - $720.00\r\n\r\nThis holds out a profitable culture to farmers.\r\n\r\n  C.

The apparatus\r\nwas tried last year by one of our members, and found to answer\r\nperfectly.--It was imported with the view to general utility, not to\r\nprivate profit, and we understand may be purchased at first cost.[4]\r\n\r\n  [4] The Editors will direct where it may be seen.\r\n\r\n    RICHARD PETERS, }\r\n    JAMES MEASE,    }\r\n    ROBERTS VAUX,   }\r\n    ISAAC C. JONES, } _Committee._\r\n\r\n    _Philadelphia, June, 1820._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR BREWING\r\n\r\n_With Needham & Co.'s Patent Portable Family Brewing Machine._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the attainment of good Malt Liquor greatly depends upon the\r\nquality of the materials from which it is produced, it may be useful\r\nto give a few general instructions for distinguishing the quality of\r\nmalt and hops, of which it should be only composed; but considerable\r\npractice being requisite to form a ready judgment, it will generally\r\nbe more safe to buy them of some reputable dealer.\r\n\r\nMALT.--To judge of the quality of malt, you must chew it, and if\r\n_sweet, tender, and mealy, with a brisk full flavour_, it is good;\r\nin coloured malt particular care should be taken that it is neither\r\nsmoky nor burnt.[5]\r\n\r\n  [5] Malt, previous to being ground, should be passed through a\r\n  screen, or sieved to remove the dust.\r\n\r\nHOPS should be of a _bright colour, free from green leaves, of\r\na quick pungent smell, and glutinous quality_, which will be\r\ndiscoverable by their adhering together, and by rubbing them in the\r\nhands. _New hops are preferable to old, after Christmas._\r\n\r\n_To Brew Ale with Table Beer after, from the same malt and\r\nhops._--The malt should be pale, sweet, and tender, ground coarse,\r\nand the hops of a pale bright colour and glutinous quality.\r\n\r\nIf the ale is for present use, 3/4 of a pound of hops to each bushel\r\nof malt will be sufficient, but for store ale use one pound per\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: brewing equipment]\r\n\r\nThe machine being placed ready for use as described in the plate,\r\nfigure G,[6] put into it as much cold water as will cover the\r\nperforated bottom of the extracting cylinder, and light the fire;\r\nthen put as much coarse ground malt into the perforated cylinder,\r\n(see the plate, figure D,) as will three parts fill it, taking care\r\nthat none goes into the centre, (which centre should be covered,\r\n(_but only_) while putting the malt in, and when mashing the malt,)\r\nnor any between the cylinder and boiler.--The malt being put in,\r\npour through the centre as much more cold water as will just cover\r\nthe malt, then make the fire good, and in one hour after stir the\r\nmalt well up with a strong mashing stick, for about ten minutes, so\r\nthat every particle of malt may be divided from the other: let the\r\nheat increase to 180 degrees, which you must ascertain by holding\r\nthe thermometer a minute in the centre part of the machine, and\r\nwhen at 180 degrees of heat, stir the malt again, and after this\r\nsecond stirring, try the heat, and if then at 180 degrees, damp the\r\nfire well with some wet ashes to prevent the heat of the mash from\r\nincreasing, and in 3 hours and a half from the time of lighting the\r\nfire, draw off the wort very gently that it may run fine, and put it\r\ninto one of the coolers, and put all the hops (rubbing them through\r\nyour hands to break the lumps) on the top of the wort to keep it\r\nhot till the time for returning it into the machine for boiling;\r\nhaving drawn off this ale wort, put into the machine through the\r\ncentre as much more cold water as will cover the grains, brisken the\r\nfire, and in half an hour stir up the malt for about ten minutes,\r\nand make it 180 degrees of heat as quick as you can, then damp the\r\nfire to prevent its getting hotter, and in one hour and a half from\r\nthe time of putting in the water, draw off this table beer wort\r\ngently, that it may run fine, and put it into the other cooler, and\r\ncover it over to keep it hot until the time for returning it into\r\nthe machine for boiling; having drawn off this table beer wort, if\r\nyou wish to make a third wort, put in as much more cold water into\r\nthe machine as you think proper, and make it 170 degrees of heat\r\nas quick as you can, and draw it off in about an hour after, and\r\nput it to the last drawing off, or wort: then take the grains out\r\nof the cylinder with a hand shovel as clean as you can, and after,\r\ntake out the cylinder,[7] and with a birch broom and a little water\r\nrince out the boiler clean, and put back the perforated cylinder\r\ninto the boiler, and then put the first drawing off or ale wort,\r\nwith all the hops, into the machine cylinder where you have taken\r\nthe grains from, and cover the machine, but be sure the centre cover\r\nis off; make it boil as quick as you can, and let it boil well one\r\nhour, then damp the fire and draw it off into a cooler or coolers,\r\nwhich should be placed in the air where it will cool quick. Having\r\ndrawn off this ale wort, return the second drawing off, or table\r\nbeer wort, with the third, into the machine to the hops left from\r\nthe ale wort, stir up the fire and make it boil as quick as you can,\r\nand let it boil well one hour, then put out the fire and draw off\r\nthe wort, and put it into a cooler placed in the air to cool quick;\r\nwhen the worts in the coolers are cooled down to 70 degrees of heat\r\nby the thermometer, put the proportion of a gill of fresh thick\r\nyeast to every 9 gallons of wort in the coolers, first thinning the\r\nyeast with a little of the wort before you put it in that it may\r\nthe better mix; and when the ale wort is cooled down to 60 degrees\r\nof heat, draw it off from the coolers with the yeast and sediment,\r\nand put it into the machine boiler (the machine boiler having been\r\npreviously cleared from the hops and cylinder,) which forms a\r\nconvenient vessel placed on its stand for the ale to ferment in,\r\nwhich must be kept fermenting in it with the cover off until the\r\nhead has the appearance of a thick brown yeast on the surface, an\r\ninch or two deep, which will take 3 or 4 days;[8] when the head has\r\nthis appearance, draw off the beer free from the yeast and bottoms\r\ninto a clean cask, which must be filled full,[9] and when done\r\nworking, put in a handful of dry hops, bung it down tight, and stow\r\nit in a cool cellar. This ale will be fit to tap in 3 or 4 weeks.\r\n\r\n  [6] The smoke pipe, with an upright elbow, about 3 or 4 feet, must\r\n  be placed on the projecting neck of the fire-place, and with a\r\n  return elbow convey the smoke through a hole, cut in the brick flue\r\n  to receive it; by this method the fire will draw well.\r\n\r\n  If any smoke should come from between the boiler and fire-place, a\r\n  little dry sand being dropped into the cavity will prevent it.--When\r\n  the brewing is over, take off the smoke pipe and shake out the soot,\r\n  which will ensure the fire drawing lively the next brewing.\r\n\r\n  [7] If the machine is large, the perforated cylinder has four\r\n  handles for the purpose of easy taking it out and in by a pulley and\r\n  rope suspended over its centre at a proper height.\r\n\r\n  [8] If the temperature of the weather is below 55 degrees of heat by\r\n  the thermometer, it will be better to place your fermenting vessel\r\n  in a situation not exposed to the cold; the cellar where you keep\r\n  your beer in would most likely be a good and handy place for this\r\n  purpose.\r\n\r\n  [9] If the cask intended for the ale, should not be full, fill it up\r\n  from your table beer, or if more than enough, put the remainder to\r\n  the table beer; but this mixing you must regulate according to the\r\n  strength you want your different sorts of beer.\r\n\r\nThe second wort for table beer should be put from the coolers with\r\nyeast and sediment into an upright cask, with the cover off or top\r\nhead out, at not exceeding 60 degrees of heat, and as soon as you\r\nperceive a brown yeast on the surface, draw it off free from the\r\nyeast and bottoms into a clean cask, which must be kept filled full,\r\nand when done working, put in a handful of dry hops, bung it down\r\ntight, and stow it in a cool cellar. This table beer will be fit to\r\ntap in a week, or as soon as fine.\r\n\r\n_To make Table Ale._--Mix the first and second worts together, and\r\nferment, and treat it the same as the ale.\r\n\r\n_To Brew Porter or Brown Beer, with Table Beer after, from the same\r\nMalt and Hops._--Use pale and brown malt in equal quantities, ground\r\ncoarse; and strong brown coloured hops of a glutinous quality. If\r\nthe beer is for present draught, 3/4 pound of hops to each bushel\r\nof malt will be sufficient, but if intended for store beer, use one\r\npound to each bushel of malt.\r\n\r\nThe process of brewing is the same as described for brewing ale\r\nwith table beer after, except the heat of each mash must not be so\r\nhigh by 10 degrees, on account of the brown malt; the first wort\r\nfermented by itself will be stout porter, and fit to tap in 3 or 4\r\nweeks; the second wort will be the table beer, and fit to tap in a\r\nweek, or as soon as fine; but if you mix the first and second worts\r\ntogether, the same as for table ale, it will be good common porter.\r\n\r\n_To Brew Table Beer only._--Let your malt be of one sort, of a full\r\nyellow colour (not brown malt) ground coarse, and strong brown\r\ncoloured hops, of a glutinous quality. If for present draught 1/2 a\r\npound of hops to each bushel of malt will be sufficient, but if for\r\nkeeping two or 3 months, use one pound of hops per bushel.\r\n\r\nThe process of brewing is the same as described for brewing porter\r\nand table beer, with the addition of another wort, that is, filling\r\nthe machine a third time with water before you take out the grains,\r\nand treating the third mash the same as the second.\r\n\r\nThe first drawing off or wort, with part of the second wort, to be\r\nboiled (first) one hour with all the hops, and the remainder of the\r\nsecond wort with the third, to be boiled next one hour to the same\r\nhops; these two boilings, when cooled down to 60 degrees of heat,\r\n(having put your yeast to it in the coolers at 70 degrees) must be\r\nput together to ferment in the machine boiler, and as soon as it has\r\nthe appearance of a brown yeast on the surface, draw it off into the\r\ncasks, which must be kept filled full, and when done working, put\r\ninto each cask a handful of dry hops, bung it down tight, and put it\r\ninto a cool cellar. Tap it in a week, or as soon as fine.\r\n\r\n_General Remarks._--The season for brewing sound keeping beer, is\r\nfrom October to May.\r\n\r\n_All Beer should be stored in cool cellars or vaults, and kept\r\nas much as possible from the common atmosphere_; and in drawing\r\nbeer from a cask, if necessary to raise the vent-peg, it should be\r\ncarefully tightened as soon as the beer is drawn.\r\n\r\nWhen beer is intended to be kept many months, the bungs of the\r\ncasks, and if bell casks are used, the whole of the head should be\r\ncovered with sand or clay, which should be kept moist.\r\n\r\n_To preserve the Machine._--When the brewing is over, wash the\r\nmachine and coolers with cold or hot water, then dry them, and put\r\nthem away in a dry place. When wanted to be used, they should be\r\nwashed with boiling water.\r\n\r\n_To keep Casks sweet._--It is recommended when a cask of beer\r\nis drawn off, to take out the head and scrub out the cask; then\r\nthoroughly dry and put it away in a dry place with the head out.\r\n\r\nIf it should be inconvenient to take out the head, and the cask is\r\nwanted to be filled again quickly, it may be washed quite clean\r\nwith warm water, and afterwards with lime water; or the grounds\r\nbeing left in the cask, and every vent stopped, (bung, tap, and vent\r\nholes,) it may be kept in that state for a short time.\r\n\r\nCasks of a bell shape are preferable for private brewing, and the\r\npatentees make them upon a principle by which the inside can be\r\nscrubbed out clean without removing the head, and at the same price\r\nas common casks of that shape.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following comparative statement of the cost of Brewing Beer with\r\nNeedham's apparatus, and of Beer when purchased, is given by the\r\nproprietor.--The references are to London prices, but an opinion may\r\nstill be formed of the great economy of Domestic Brewing.\r\n\r\n  Daily Consumption of| Yearly Consumption| Brewers' Prices.    | Yearly expense\r\n   ale in a family, 3 |   is 137 gallons  | At 2s. 6d. per gal. |  L.17   2  6\r\n   pints Do. of table | Is 137 gallons    | At 8d.              |     4  11  4\r\n   beer, 3 pints      |                     |                   | -------------\r\n                                                                      21  13 10\r\n\r\n  To Brew the above quantity of good Ale and Table Beer, 15-1/4\r\n    Bushels of Malt are required, the cost of which, at 10s. per\r\n    Bushel, will be                                    L.7  12  6\r\n  11-1/2 _lbs._ best Hops, for ditto, at 5s.             2  17  6----10  10  0\r\n                 Yearly saving in the above quantity                 11  3  10\r\n\r\nThe above calculation sufficiently proves that the Patent Brewing\r\nMachine will, to the smallest Family who purchase Brewer's Beer, pay\r\nfor itself in One Year, and those who have been accustomed to Brew\r\nby the old Method, will find the beer much stronger and better by\r\nusing this Machine, and very considerably less likely to be spoiled\r\nin Brewing, with a great saving in Fuel, Labour, and Time.\r\n\r\nAs it may be inconvenient, or too expensive, for many private\r\nfamilies to purchase a brewing machine, the following Directions are\r\nsubjoined, which will enable them, by the aid of the vessels used\r\nin a family, to brew a barrel of beer; and by attention, and a few\r\nexperiments, they will produce an excellent beverage.\r\n\r\nPrepare a tub for making the extract, by fitting a false bottom with\r\nnumerous holes, and raised about half an inch from the real bottom,\r\nin which fix a cock for drawing off the extract. Have four bushels\r\nof malt coarsely ground, and heat your water to about 170 or 175\r\ndegrees[10] of heat, of Fahrenheit's thermometer. Then pour in the\r\ntub about thirty-eight gallons of the water, and gently stir in the\r\nmalt, until it is all mixed. Cover it, and let it stand about an\r\nhour and a half; draw off the extract into a vessel, and throw in\r\nabout one and a quarter pounds of hops for liquor for present use,\r\nor about two or two and a half pounds for keeping liquors; cover the\r\nvessel to keep in the heat, and pour over the malt about 26 gallons\r\nof water, of about the same heat as the first, stirring it until it\r\nis well mixed with the malt; let it stand one hour, then draw off\r\nthe extract, add it to the first extract, and put them on to boil in\r\nan open kettle: this will be your strong beer. Then pour over the\r\nmalt about twenty gallons of water, for small beer, at about 160 or\r\n170 degrees of heat. This last will not require stirring, and the\r\nextract may remain covered until the kettle is ready for it. Keep\r\nthe strong beer boiling smartly for about one hour and a quarter, or\r\none hour and a half, for present use, or two hours for keeping: then\r\npour it through a sieve or strainer, and set it to cool. Return the\r\nhops into the kettle with your third extract, or small beer, which\r\nset to boiling as soon as practicable, and continue it for about an\r\nhour and a half; then pour it through the strainer, and set it to\r\ncool. When cool, ferment according to the directions accompanying\r\nthe brewing machine. The quantity of water used may be varied at\r\nthe discretion of the person brewing. By diminishing the water,\r\nhe may increase the strength of the liquor, or by increasing it,\r\ndiminish the strength. Thus with the hops he may vary the quantity\r\nto suit his palate in the degree of bitter flavour that may be most\r\nagreeable.--For fomenting, a cask with one head taken out, will\r\nanswer the same purpose as the machine boiler.\r\n\r\n  [10] NOTE.--A person who experienced its benefit and almost\r\n  certainty, informs us, that he always practised looking steadily\r\n  into the vapours of the brewing kettle, after the liquor (water)\r\n  had been in a boiling state for some time. The moment he could\r\n  distinguish the features of his face, in the surface of the water,\r\n  he directed the cock to be turned; and the liquor, of course, thrown\r\n  over the mash. This was an unerring substitute for a thermometer, or\r\n  sachorometer. His kettle, which had been a still, held about sixty\r\n  gallons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SNOW STORM.\r\n\r\nFrom Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, for April.\r\n\r\n     \"'Tis only from the belief of the goodness and wisdom of a\r\n     Supreme Being, that our calamities can be borne in that manner\r\n     which becomes a man.\"--HENRY MACKENZIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn summer there is a beauty in the wildest moors of Scotland, and\r\nthe wayfaring man who sits down for an hour's rest beside some\r\nlittle spring that flows unheard through the brightened moss and\r\nwater-cresses, feels his weary heart revived by the silent, serene,\r\nand solitary prospect. On every side sweet sunny spots of verdure\r\nsmile towards him from among the melancholy heather--unexpectedly\r\nin the solitude a stray sheep, it may be with its lambs, starts\r\nhalf alarmed at his motionless figure--insects large, bright, and\r\nbeautiful come careering by him through the desert air--nor does the\r\nWild want its own songsters, the grey linnet, fond of the blooming\r\nfurze, and now and then the lark mounting up to heaven above the\r\nsummits of the green pastoral hills.--During such a sunshiny hour,\r\nthe lonely cottage on the waste seems to stand a paradise; and as he\r\nrises to pursue his journey, the traveller looks back and blesses\r\nit with a mingled emotion of delight and envy. There, thinks he,\r\nabide the children of innocence and contentment, the two most benign\r\nspirits that watch over human life.\r\n\r\nBut other thoughts arise in the mind of him who may chance to\r\njourney through the same scene in the desolation of Winter. The cold\r\nbleak sky girdles the moor as with a belt of ice--life is frozen in\r\nair and on earth. The silent is not of repose but extinction--and\r\nshould a solitary human dwelling catch his eye half buried in the\r\nsnow, he is sad for the sake of them whose destiny it is to abide\r\nfar from the cheerful haunts of men, shrouded up in melancholy, by\r\npoverty held in thrall, or pining away in unvisited or untended\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\nBut, in truth, the heart of human life is but imperfectly discovered\r\nfrom its countenance; and before we can know what the summer, or\r\nwhat the winter yields for enjoyment or trial to our country's\r\npeasantry, we must have conversed with them in their fields and by\r\ntheir fire-sides; and make ourselves acquainted with the powerful\r\nministry of the seasons, not over those objects alone that feed the\r\neye and the imagination, but over all the incidents, occupations,\r\nand events that modify or constitute the existence of the poor.\r\n\r\nI have a short and simple story to tell of the winter life of the\r\nmoorland cottager--a story but of one evening--with a few events and\r\nno signal catastrophe--but which may haply please those hearts whose\r\ndelight it is to think on the humble under-plots that are carrying\r\non in the great Drama of life.\r\n\r\nTwo cottagers, husband and wife, were sitting by their cheerful\r\npeat-fire one winter evening, in a small lonely hut, on the edge\r\nof a wide moor, at some miles distance from any other habitation.\r\nThere had been, at one time, several huts of the same kind erected\r\nclose together, and inhabited by families of the poorest class of\r\nday-labourers who found work among the distant farms, and at night\r\nreturned to dwellings which were rent free, with their little\r\ngardens, won from the waste.--But one family after another had\r\ndwindled away, and the turf-built huts had all fallen into ruins,\r\nexcept one that had always stood in the centre of this little\r\nsolitary village, with its summer walls covered with the richest\r\nhoneysuckles and in the midst of the brightest of all the gardens.\r\nIt alone now sent up its smoke into the clear winter sky--and its\r\nlittle end window, now lighted up, was the only ground star that\r\nshone towards the belated traveller, if any such ventured to cross,\r\non a winter night, a scene so dreary and desolate. The affairs of\r\nthe small household were all arranged for the night. The little\r\nrough pony that had drawn in a sledge, from the heart of the\r\nBlack-Moss, the fuel by whose blaze the cottiers were now sitting\r\ncheerily and the little Highland cow, whose milk enabled them to\r\nlive, were standing amicably together, under cover of a rude shed,\r\nof which one side was formed by the peat stack, and which was at\r\nonce byre, and stable, and hen-roost. Within, the clock ticked\r\ncheerfully as the fire-light readied its old oak-wood case across\r\nthe yellow sanded floor--and a small round table stood between,\r\ncovered with a snow-white cloth, on which were milk and oat cakes,\r\nthe morning, mid-day, and evening meal of these frugal and contented\r\ncottiers. The spades and the mattocks of the labourer were collected\r\ninto one corner, and showed that the succeeding day was the blessed\r\nSabbath--while on the wooden chimney-piece were seen lying an open\r\nBible ready for family worship.\r\n\r\nThe father and mother were sitting together without opening their\r\nlips, but with their hearts overflowing with happiness, for on this\r\nSaturday-night they were, every minute, expecting to hear at the\r\nlatch the hand of their only daughter, a maiden of about fifteen\r\nyears, who was at service with a farmer over the hills. This dutiful\r\nchild was, as they knew, to bring home to them \"her sair-worn penny\r\nfee,\" a pittance which, in the beauty of her girl-hood, she earned\r\nsinging at her work, and which, in the benignity of that sinless\r\ntime, she would pour with tears into the bosoms she so dearly loved.\r\nForty shillings a year were all the wages of sweet Hannah Lee--but\r\nthough she wore at her labour a tortoise-shell comb in her auburn\r\nhair, and though in the kirk none were more becomingly arrayed\r\nthan she, one half, at least, of her earnings were to be reserved\r\nfor the holiest of all purposes, and her kind innocent heart was\r\ngladdened when she looked on the little purse that was, on the long\r\nexpected Saturday-night, to be taken from her bosom, and put, with a\r\nblessing, into the hand of her father, now growing old at his daily\r\ntoils.\r\n\r\nOf such a child the happy cottiers were thinking in their silence.\r\nAnd well might they be called happy. It is at that sweet season that\r\nfilial piety is most beautiful.--Their own Hannah, had just outgrown\r\nthe mere unthinking gladness of childhood, but had not yet reached\r\nthat time, when inevitable selfishness mixes with the pure current\r\nof love. She had begun to think on what her affectionate heart had\r\nfelt so long; and when she looked on the pale face and bending\r\nframe of her mother, on the deepening wrinkles, and whitening hairs\r\nof her father, often would she lie weeping for their sakes on her\r\nmidnight bed--and wish that she was beside them as they slept,\r\nthat she might kneel down and kiss them, and mention their names\r\nover and over again in her prayer. The parents whom before she had\r\nonly loved, her expanding heart now also venerated. With gushing\r\ntenderness was now mingled a holy fear and an awful reverence. She\r\nhad discerned the relation in which she, an only child, stood to\r\nher poor parents now that they were getting old, and there was not\r\na passage in Scripture that spake of parents or of children, from\r\nJoseph sold into slavery, to Mary weeping below the Cross, that was\r\nnot written, never to be obliterated, on her uncorrupted heart.\r\n\r\nThe father rose from his seat, and went to the door to look out\r\ninto the night.--The stars were in thousands--and the full moon\r\nwas risen.--It was almost light as day, and the snow, that seemed\r\nincrusted with diamonds, was so hardened by the frost, that his\r\ndaughter's homeward feet would leave no mark on its surface. He had\r\nbeen toiling all day among the distant Castle-woods, and, stiff\r\nand wearied as he now was, he was almost tempted to go to meet his\r\nchild, but his wife's kind voice dissuaded him, and returning to the\r\nfire-side, they began to talk of her whose image had been so long\r\npassing before them in their silence.\r\n\r\n\"She is growing up to be a bony lassie,\" said the mother, \"her long\r\nand weary attendance on me during my fever last spring kept her down\r\nawhile--but now she is sprouting fast and fair as a lily, and may\r\nthe blessing of God be as dew and as sunshine to our sweet flower\r\nall the days she bloometh upon this earth.\" \"Aye Agnes,\" replied the\r\nfather, \"we are not very old yet--though we are getting older--and a\r\nfew years will bring her to women's estate, and what thing on this\r\nearth, think ye, human or brute, would ever think of injuring her?\r\nWhy I was speaking about her yesterday to the minister as he was\r\nriding by, and he told me that none answered at the Examination\r\nin the Kirk so well as Hannah.--Poor thing--I well think she has\r\nall the Bible by heart--indeed, she has read but little else--only\r\nsome stories, too true ones, of the blessed martyrs, and some o'\r\nthe auld sangs o' Scotland, in which there is nothing but what is\r\ngood, and which, to be sure, she sings, God bless her, sweeter than\r\nany laverock.\" \"Aye--were we both to die this very night, she would\r\nbe happy--not that she would forget us, all the days of her life.\r\nBut have you not seen, husband, that God always makes the orphan\r\nhappy?--None so little lonesome as they! They come to make friends\r\no' all the bonny and sweet things in the world around them, and\r\nall the kind hearts in the world make friends o' them. They come\r\nto know that God is more especially the father o' them on earth\r\nwhose parents he has taken up to heaven--and therefore it is that\r\nthey for whom so many have fears, fear not at all for themselves,\r\nbut go dancing and singing along like children whose parents are\r\nboth alive! Would it not be so with our dear Hannah? So douce and\r\nthoughtful a child--but never sad nor miserable--ready it is true\r\nto shed tears for little, but as ready to dry them up and break\r\nout into smiles! I know not why it is, husband, but this night my\r\nheart warms toward her, beyond usual. The moon and stars are at this\r\nmoment looking down upon her, and she looking up to them, as she\r\nis glinting homewards over the snow. I wish she were but here, and\r\ntaking the comb out o' her bonny hair, and letting it all fall down\r\nin clusters before the fire, to melt away the cranreuch!\"\r\n\r\nWhile the parents were thus speaking of their daughter a loud sugh\r\nof wind came suddenly over the cottage, and the leafless ash-tree\r\nunder whose shelter it stood, creaked and groaned dismally, as it\r\npassed by.--The father started up, and going again to the door,\r\nsaw that a sudden change had come over the face of the night. The\r\nmoon had nearly disappeared, and was just visible in a dim yellow,\r\nglimmering in the sky.--All the remote stars were obscured, and only\r\none or two faintly seemed in a sky that half an hour before was\r\nperfectly cloudless, but that was now driven with rack, and mist,\r\nand sleet, the whole atmosphere being in commotion. He stood for\r\na single moment to observe the direction of this unforseen storm,\r\nand then hastily asked for his staff. \"I thought I had been more\r\nweather-wise--A storm is coming down from the Cairnbrae-hawse, and\r\nwe shall have nothing but a wild night.\" He then whistled on his\r\ndog--an old sheep dog, too old for its former labours and set off to\r\nmeet his daughter, who might then, for aught he knew, be crossing\r\nthe Black-moss.\r\n\r\nThe mother accompanied her husband to the door, and took a long\r\nfrightened look at the angry sky. As she kept gazing, it became\r\nstill more terrible. The last shred of blue was extinguished--the\r\nwind went whirling in roaring eddies, and great flakes of snow\r\ncircled about in the middle air, whether drifted up from the ground,\r\nor driven down from the clouds, the fear-striken mother knew not,\r\nbut she at least knew, that it seemed a night of danger, despair,\r\nand death. \"Lord have mercy on us James, what will become of our\r\npoor bairn!\" But her husband heard not her words, for he was already\r\nout of sight in the snow storm, and she was left to the terror of\r\nher own soul in that lonesome cottage.\r\n\r\nLittle Hannah Lee had left her master's house, soon as the rim of\r\nthe great moon was seen by her eyes, that had been long anxiously\r\nwatching it from the window, rising like a joyful dream, over the\r\ngloomy mountain-tops; and all by herself she tripped along beneath\r\nthe beauty of the silent heaven. Still as she kept ascending and\r\ndescending the knolls that lay in the bosom of the glen, she sung\r\nto herself a song, a hymn, or a psalm, without the accompaniment\r\nof the streams, now all silent in the frost; and ever and anon she\r\nstopped to try to count the stars that lay in some more beautiful\r\npart of the sky, or gazed, on the constellations that she knew,\r\nand called them, in her joy, by the names they bore among the\r\nshepherds.--There were none to hear her voice, or see her smiles,\r\nbut the ear and eye of Providence. As on she glided and took her\r\nlooks from heaven, she saw her own little fire-side--her parents\r\nwaiting for her arrival--the bible opened for worship--her own\r\nlittle room kept so neatly for her, with its mirror hanging by the\r\nwindow, in which to braid her hair by the morning light--her bed\r\nprepared for her by her mother's hand--the primroses in her garden\r\npeeping through the snow--old Tray, who ever welcomed her home with\r\nhis dim white eyes--the poney and the cow; friends all, and inmates\r\nof that happy household. So stepped she along, while the snow\r\ndiamonds glittering around her feet, and the frost wove a wreath of\r\nlucid pearls around her forehead.\r\n\r\nShe had now reached the edge of the Black-moss, which lay half way\r\nbetween her master's and her father's dwelling, when she heard a\r\nloud noise coming down from Glen-Scrae, and in a few seconds, she\r\nfelt on her face some flakes of snow. She looked up the glen, and\r\nsaw the snow storm coming down, fast as a flood. She felt no fears;\r\nbut she ceased her song; and had there been a human eye to look upon\r\nher there, it might have seen a shadow on her face. She continued\r\nher course, and felt bolder and bolder every step that brought her\r\nnearer to her parent's house. But the snow storm had now reached\r\nthe Black-moss, and the broad line of light that had lain in the\r\ndirection of her home, was soon swallowed up, and the child was in\r\nutter darkness. She saw nothing but the flakes of snow, interminably\r\nintermingled, and furiously wafted in the air, close to her head;\r\nshe heard nothing but one wild, fierce, fitful howl. The cold became\r\nintense, and her little feet and hands were fast, being benumbed\r\ninto insensibility.\r\n\r\n\"It is a fearful change,\" muttered the child to herself, but still\r\nshe did not fear, for she had been born in a moorland cottage, and\r\nlived all her days among the hardships of the hills.--\"What will\r\nbecome of the poor sheep,\" thought she,--but still she scarcely\r\nthought of her own danger, for innocence and youth, and joy, are\r\nslow to think of ought evil befalling themselves, and thinking\r\nbenignly of all living things, forget their own fear in their pity\r\nof others' sorrow.--At last, she could no longer discern a single\r\nmark on the snow, either of human steps, or of sheep track, or the\r\nfoot print of a wild-fowl. Suddenly, too, she felt out of breath and\r\nexhausted,--and shedding tears for herself at last sank down in the\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nIt was now that her heart began to quake for fear. She remembered\r\nstories of the shepherds lost in the snow,--of a mother and child\r\nfrozen to death on that very moor,--and, in a moment she knew that\r\nshe was to die. Bitterly did the poor child weep, for death was\r\nterrible to her, who, though poor, enjoyed the bright little world\r\nof youth and innocence. The skies of heaven were dearer than she\r\nknew to her,--so were the flowers of earth. She had been happy\r\nat her work--happy in her sleep--happy in the kirk on Sabbath. A\r\nthousand thoughts had the solitary child,--and in her own heart\r\nwas a spring of happiness, pure and undisturbed as any fount that\r\nsparkles unseen all the year through, in some quiet nook among the\r\npastoral hills. But now there was to be an end of all this,--she was\r\nto be frozen to death--and lie there till the thaw might come; and\r\nthen her father would find her body, and carry it away to be buried\r\nin the kirk-yard.\r\n\r\nThe tears were frozen on her cheeks as soon as shed--and scarcely\r\nhad her little hands strength to clasp themselves together, as she\r\nthought of an overruling and merciful Lord came across her heart.\r\nThen, indeed, the fears of this religious child were calmed, and she\r\nheard without terror, the plover's wailing cry, and the deep boom of\r\nthe bittern sounding in the moss. \"I will repeat the Lord's prayer.\"\r\nAnd drawing her plaid more closely around her, she whispered beneath\r\nits ineffectual cover; \"Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed\r\nbe thy name,--thy kingdom come--thy will be done on earth as it is\r\nin heaven.\" Had human aid been within fifty yards, it could have\r\nbeen of no avail--eye could not see her--ear could not hear her in\r\nthat howling darkness. But that low prayer was heard in the centre\r\nof eternity--and that little sinless child was lying in the snow,\r\nbeneath the all-seeing eye of God.\r\n\r\nThe maiden having prayed to her Father in Heaven--then thought of\r\nher Father on earth. Alas! they were not far separated! The father\r\nwas lying but a short distance from his child; he too had sunk down\r\nin the drifting snow, after having in less than an hour, exhausted\r\nall the strength of fear, pity, hope, despair, and resignation, that\r\ncould rise in a father's heart, blindly seeking to rescue his only\r\nchild from death, thinking that one desperate exertion might enable\r\nthem to die in each other's arms. There they lay, within a stone's\r\nthrow of each other, while a huge snow drift was every moment piling\r\nitself up into a more insurmountable barrier between the dying\r\nparent and his dying child.\r\n\r\nThere was all this while a blazing fire in the cottage--a white\r\nspread table--and beds prepared for the family to lie down in peace.\r\nYet was she who sat thereon more to be pitied than the old man and\r\nthe child stretched upon the snow. \"I will not go to seek them--that\r\nwould be tempting Providence--and wilfully putting out the lamp\r\nof life. No! I will abide here, and pray for their souls?\" Then\r\nas she knelt down, looked she at the useless fire burning away so\r\ncheerfully, when all she loved might be dying of cold--and unable\r\nto bear the thought, she shrieked out a prayer, as if she might\r\npierce the sky up to the very throne of God, and send with it her\r\nown miserable soul, to plead before Him for the deliverance of her\r\nchild and husband.--She then fell down in blessed forgetfulness\r\nof all trouble, in the midst of the solitary cheerfulness of that\r\nbright-burning hearth--and the bible, which she had been trying to\r\nread in the pause of her agony, remained clasped in her hands.\r\n\r\nHannah Lee had been a servant for more than six months--and it was\r\nnot to be thought that she was not beloved in her master's family.\r\nSoon after she had left the house, her master's son, a youth of\r\nabout eighteen years, who had been among the hills, looking after\r\nthe sheep, came home, and was disappointed to find that he had\r\nlost an opportunity of accompanying Hannah part of the way to her\r\nfather's cottage. But the hour of eight had gone by, and not even\r\nthe company of young William Grieve, could induce the kind-hearted\r\ndaughter to delay sitting out on her journey, a few minutes beyond\r\nthe time promised to her parents. \"I do not like the night,\" said\r\nWilliam--\"there will be a fresh fall of snow soon, or the witch\r\nof Glen Scrae is a liar, for a snow-cloud is hanging o'er the\r\nbirch-tree-linn, and it may be down to the Black-moss as soon as\r\nHannah Lee.\" So he called his two sheep dogs, that had taken their\r\nplace under the long table before the window, and set out, half in\r\njoy, half in fear, to overtake Hannah and see her safely across the\r\nBlack-moss.\r\n\r\nThe snow began to drift so fast, that before he had reached the\r\nhead of the Glen, there was nothing to be seen but a little bit\r\nof the wooden rail of the bridge across the Sauch burn. William\r\nGrieve was the most active shepherd in a large pastoral parish--he\r\nhad often passed the night among the wintery hills for the sake\r\nof a few sheep, and all the snow that had ever fell from Heaven,\r\nwould not have made him turn back when Hannah Lee was before him;\r\nand as his terrified heart told him, in imminent danger of being\r\nlost.--As he advanced, he felt that it was no longer a walk of love\r\nor friendship, for which he had been glad of an excuse. Death stared\r\nhim in the face, and his young soul, now beginning to feel all the\r\npassions of youth, was filled with phrenzy. He had seen Hannah\r\nevery day--at the fire-side--at work--in the kirk--on holydays--at\r\nprayers--bringing supper to his aged parents--smiling and singing\r\nabout the house from morning till night. She had often brought his\r\nown meal to him among the hills--and he now found, that though he\r\nhad never talked to her about love, except smilingly, and playfully,\r\nthat he loved her beyond father or mother, or his own soul. \"I\r\nwill save thee, Hannah,\" he cried with a loud sob, \"or lie down\r\nbeside thee in the snow--and we will die together in our youth.\"\r\nA wild whistling wind went by him, and the snow-flakes whirled so\r\nfiercely round his head, that he staggered on for a while in utter\r\nblindness. He knew the path that Hannah must have taken, and went\r\nforward shouting aloud, and stopping every twenty yards to listen\r\nfor a voice. He sent his well trained dogs over the snow in all\r\ndirections--repeating to them her name \"Hannah Lee,\" that the dumb\r\nanimals might, in their sagacity, know for whom they were searching;\r\nand as they looked up in his face, and set off to scour the moor,\r\nhe almost believed that they knew his meaning, (and it is probable\r\nthey did) and were eager to find in her bewilderment the kind maiden\r\nby whose hand they had so often been fed. Often went they off into\r\nthe darkness, and as often returned, but their looks showed that\r\nevery quest had been in vain. Meanwhile the snow was of a fearful\r\ndepth, and falling without intermission or diminution. Had the young\r\nshepherd been thus alone, walking across the moor on his ordinary\r\nbusiness, it is probable that he might have been alarmed for his own\r\nsafety--nay, that in spite of all his strength and agility, he might\r\nhave sunk down beneath the inclemency of the night and perished.\r\nBut now, the passion of his soul carried him with supernatural\r\nstrength along, and extricated him from wreath and pitfall. Still\r\nthere was no trace of poor Hannah Lee--and one of his dogs at last\r\ncame close to his feet, worn out entirely, and afraid to leave its\r\nmaster--while the other was mute, and, as the shepherd thought,\r\nprobably unable to force its way out of some hollow or through some\r\nfloundering drift.--Then he all at once knew that Hannah Lee was\r\ndead--and dashed himself down in the snow in a fit of passion.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that the youth had ever been sorely tried--all\r\nhis hidden and unconscious love for the fair lost girl had flowed up\r\nfrom the bottom of his heart--and at once the sole object which had\r\nblessed his life and made him the happiest of the happy, was taken\r\naway and cruelly destroyed--so that sullen, wrathful, baffled and\r\ndespairing, there he lay, cursing his existence, and in too great\r\nagony to think of prayer. \"God,\" he then thought, \"has forsaken\r\nme--and why should he think on me, when he suffers one so good and\r\nbeautiful as Hannah to be frozen to death.\" God thought both of\r\nhim and Hannah--and through his infinite mercy forgave the sinner\r\nin his wild turbulence of passion. William Grieve had never gone\r\nto bed without joining in prayer--and he revered the Sabbath-day\r\nand kept it holy. Much is forgiven to the human heart by him who\r\nso fearfully framed it; and God is not slow to pardon the love\r\nwhich one human being bears to another, in his frailty--even though\r\nthat love forget or arraign his own unsleeping providence. His\r\nvoice has told us to love one another--and William loved Hannah\r\nin simplicity, innocence, and truth. That she should perish, was\r\na thought so dreadful, that, in its agony God seemed a ruthless\r\nbeing--\"blow--blow--blow--and drift us up for ever--we cannot be far\r\nasunder--O Hannah--Hannah--think ye not that the fearful God has\r\nforsaken us?\"\r\n\r\nAs the boy groaned these words passionately through his quivering\r\nlips, there was a sudden lowness in the air, and he heard the\r\nbarking of his absent dog, while the one at his feet hurried off in\r\nthe direction of the sound, and soon loudly joined the cry. It was\r\nnot a bark of surprise--or anger--or fear--but of recognition and\r\nlove. William sprung up from his bed in the snow and with his heart\r\nknocking at his bosom even to sickness, he rushed headlong through\r\nthe drifts, with a giant's strength, and fell down half dead with\r\njoy and terror beside the body of Hannah Lee.\r\n\r\nBut he soon recovered from that fit, and lifting the cold corpse\r\nin his arms, he kissed her lips, and her cheeks, and her forehead,\r\nand her closed eyes, till, as he kept gazing on her face in utter\r\ndespair, her head fell back on his shoulder, and a long deep sigh\r\ncame from her inmost bosom.--\"She is yet alive thank God!\"--and as\r\nthat expression left his lips for the first time that night, he felt\r\na pang of remorse:\" \"I said, O God, that thou hadst forsaken us--I\r\nam not worthy to be saved; but let not this maiden perish, for the\r\nsake of her parents, who have no other child.\"\r\n\r\nThe distracted youth prayed to God with the same earnestness as if\r\nhe had been beseeching a fellow creature, in whose hand was the\r\npower of life and of death. The presence of the Great Being was\r\nfelt by him in the dark and howling wild, and strength was imparted\r\nto him as to a deliverer. He bore along the fair child in his\r\narms, even as if she had been a lamb. The snow drift blew not--the\r\nwind fell dead--a sort of glimmer, like that of an upbreaking and\r\ndeparting storm, gathered about him--his dogs barked and jumped,\r\nand burrowed joyfully in the snow--and the youth, strong in sudden\r\nhope, exclaimed, \"With the blessing of God, who has not deserted us\r\nin our sore distress, will I carry thee, Hannah, in my arms, and lay\r\nthee down alive in the house of thy father.\"--At this moment there\r\nwere no stars in Heaven, but she opened her dim blue eyes upon him\r\non whose bosom she was unconsciously lying, and said, as in a dream,\r\n\"Send the riband that ties up my hair, as a keepsake to William\r\nGrieve.\" \"She thinks that she is on her death bed, and forgets not\r\nthe son of her master. It is the voice of God that tells me she will\r\nnot now die, and that, under His grace, I shall be her deliverer.\"\r\n\r\nThe short lived rage of the storm was soon over, and William could\r\nattend to the beloved being on his bosom. The warmth of his heart\r\nseemed to infuse life into her's; and as he gently placed her feet\r\non the snow, till he muffled her up in his plaid, as well as in her\r\nown, she made an effort to stand, and with extreme perplexity and\r\nbewilderment, faintly inquired, where she was, and what fearful\r\ncatastrophe had befallen them? She was, however, too weak to walk;\r\nand as her young master carried her along, she murmured, \"O William!\r\nwhat if my father be in the moor?--For if you, who need care so\r\nlittle about me, have come hither, as I suppose to save my life, you\r\nmay be sure that my father sat not within doors during the storm.\"\r\nAs she spoke it was calm below, but the wind was still alive in\r\nthe upper air, and cloud, rack, mist, and sleet, were all driving\r\nabout in the sky. Out shone for a moment the pallid and ghostly\r\nmoon, through a rent in the gloom, and by that uncertain light, came\r\nstaggering forward the figure of a man.--\"Father--Father,\" cried\r\nHannah--and his gray hairs were already on her cheek. The barking\r\nof the dogs and the shouting of the young shepherd had struck his\r\near, as the sleep of death was stealing over him, and with the last\r\neffort of benumbed nature, he had roused himself from that fatal\r\ntorpor and prest through the snow wreath that had separated him from\r\nhis child. As yet they knew not of the danger each had endured--but\r\neach judged of the other's suffering from their own, and father and\r\ndaughter regarded one another as creatures rescued, and hardly yet\r\nrescued from death.\r\n\r\nBut a few minutes ago, and the three human beings who loved each\r\nother so well, and now feared not to cross the Moor in safety, were,\r\nas they thought, on their death beds. Deliverance now shone upon\r\nthem all like a gentle fire, dispelling that pleasant but deadly\r\ndrowsiness; and the old man was soon able to assist William Grieve\r\nin leading Hannah along through the snow. Her colour and her warmth\r\nreturned, and her lover--for so might he well now be called--felt\r\nher heart gently beating against her side. Filled as that heart was\r\nwith gratitude to God, joy in her deliverance, love to her father,\r\nand purest affection for her master's son, never before had the\r\ninnocent maiden known what was happiness--and never more was she\r\nto forget it. The night was now almost calm, and fast returning\r\nto its former beauty--when the party saw the first twinkle of the\r\nfire through the low window of the Cottage of the Moor. They soon\r\nwere at the garden gate--and to relieve the heart of the wife and\r\nmother within, they talked loudly and cheerfully--naming each other\r\nfamiliarly, and laughing between, like persons who had known neither\r\ndanger nor distress.\r\n\r\nNo voice answered from within--no footsteps came to the door which\r\nstood open, as when the father had left it in his fear, and now he\r\nthought with affright, that his wife, feeble as she was, had been\r\nunable to support the loneliness, and had followed him out into the\r\nnight, never to be brought home alive.--As they bore Hannah into\r\nthe house, his fear gave way to worse, for there upon the hard clay\r\nfloor lay the mother upon her face, as if murdered by some savage\r\nblow. She was in the same deadly swoon into which she had fallen on\r\nher husband's departure, three hours before. The old man raised her\r\nup, and her pulse was still--so was her heart--her face pale and\r\nsunken--and her body cold as ice. \"I have recovered a daughter,\"\r\nsaid the old man, \"but I have lost a wife;\" and he carried her,\r\nwith a groan, to the bed on which he laid her lifeless body. The\r\nsight was too much for Hannah, worn out as she was, and who had\r\nhitherto been able to support herself in the delightful expectation\r\nof gladdening her mother's heart by her safe arrival. She, too, now\r\nswooned away, and, as she was placed on the bed beside her mother,\r\nit seemed, indeed that death, disappointed of his prey on the wild\r\nmoor, had seized it in the cottage, and by the fire-side. The\r\nhusband knelt down by the bed-side, and held his wife's icy hand in\r\nhis, while William Grieve appalled, and awe-stricken, hung over his\r\nHannah, and inwardly implored God that the night's wild adventure\r\nmight not have so ghastly an end. But Hannah's young heart soon\r\nbegan once more to beat--and soon as she came to her recollection,\r\nshe rose up with a face whiter than ashes, and free from all\r\nsmiles, as if none had ever played there, and joined her father and\r\nyoung master in their efforts to restore her mother to life.\r\n\r\nIt was the mercy of God that had struck her down to the earth,\r\ninsensible to the shrieking winds, and the fears that would\r\notherwise have killed her. Three hours of that wild storm had passed\r\nover her head, and she heard nothing more than if she had been\r\nasleep in a breathless night of the summer dew. Not even a dream\r\nhad touched her brain, and when she opened her eyes which, as she\r\nthought had been but a moment shut, she had scarcely time to recal\r\nto her recollection the image of her husband rushing out into the\r\nstorm, and of a daughter therein lost, till she beheld that very\r\nhusband kneeling tenderly by her bed-side, and that very daughter\r\nsmoothing the pillow on which her aching temples reclined. But she\r\nknew from the white steadfast countenances before her that there\r\nhad been tribulation and deliverance, and she looked on the beloved\r\nbeings ministering by her bed, as more fearfully dear to her from\r\nthe unimagined danger from which she felt assured they had been\r\nrescued by the arm of the Almighty.\r\n\r\nThere is little need to speak of returning recollection, and\r\nreturning strength. They had all now power to weep, and power to\r\npray. The Bible had been lying in its place ready for worship--and\r\nthe father read aloud that chapter in which is narrated our\r\nSaviour's act of miraculous power, by which he saved Peter from\r\nthe sea. Soon as the solemn thoughts awakened by that act of mercy\r\nso similar to that which had rescued themselves from death had\r\nsubsided, and they had all risen up from prayer, they gathered\r\nthemselves in gratitude round the little table which had stood\r\nso many hours spread--and exhausted nature was strengthened\r\nand restored by a frugal and simple meal partaken of in silent\r\nthankfulness.\r\n\r\nThe whole story of the night was then calmly recited--and when the\r\nmother heard how the stripling had followed her sweet Hannah into\r\nthe storm, and borne her in his arms through a hundred drifted\r\nheaps--and then looked upon her in her pride, so young, so innocent,\r\nand so beautiful, she knew, that were the child indeed to become an\r\norphan, there was one, who, if there was either trust in nature, or\r\ntruth in religion, would guard and cherish her all the days of her\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt was not nine o'clock when the storm came down from Glen Scrae\r\nupon the Black-moss, and now in a pause of silence the clock struck\r\ntwelve. Within these three hours William and Hannah had led a life\r\nof trouble and of joy, that had enlarged and kindled their hearts\r\nwithin them--and they felt that henceforth they were to live wholly\r\nfor each other's sakes. His love was the proud and exulting love of\r\na deliverer, who, under Providence, had saved from the frost and\r\nthe snow the innocence and the beauty of which his young passionate\r\nheart had been so desperately enamoured--and he now thought of his\r\nown Hannah Lee ever more moving about in his father's house, not as\r\na servant, but as a daughter--and when some few happy years had gone\r\nby, his own most beautiful and most loving wife. The innocent maiden\r\nstill called him her young master--but was not ashamed of the holy\r\naffection which she now knew that she had long felt for the fearless\r\nyouth on whose bosom she had thought herself dying in that cold\r\nand miserable moor. Her heart leapt within her when she heard her\r\nparents bless him by his name--and when he took her hand into his\r\nbefore them, and vowed before that Power who had that night saved\r\nthem from the snow, that Hannah Lee should ere long be his wedded\r\nwife--she wept and sobbed as if her heart would break in a fit of\r\nstrange and insupportable happiness.\r\n\r\nThe young shepherd rose to bid them farewell--\"my father will think\r\nI am lost,\" said he, with a grave smile, \"and my Hannah's mother\r\nknows what it is to fear for a child.\" So nothing was said to detain\r\nhim, and the family went with him to the door. The skies smiled\r\nserenely as if a storm had never swept before the stars--the moon\r\nwas sinking from her meridian, but in cloudless splendour--and the\r\nhollow of the hills was hushed as that of heaven. Danger there\r\nwas none over the placid night-scene--the happy youth soon crost\r\nthe Black-moss, now perfectly still--and, perhaps, just as he was\r\npassing, with a shudder of gratitude, the very spot where his sweet\r\nHannah Lee had so nearly perished, she was lying down to sleep in\r\nher innocence, or dreaming of one now dearer to her than all on\r\nearth but her parents.\r\n\r\n  EREMUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY NEIGHBOUR EPHRAIM.\r\n\r\n\r\nI went this afternoon to pay a visit to my neighbour Ephraim; indeed\r\nI find his cheerful fire-side so much more pleasant than my own\r\nlittle solitary dwelling, that I am afraid I go there rather too\r\noften; however, as yet I have not remarked any coldness or distance\r\nin their reception of me. Ephraim had been a little indisposed, and\r\nI found him reclining on the sofa; his wife was preparing something\r\ncomfortable for him by the fire, and his daughter, having arranged\r\nhis pillow to his mind, sat with her work at his feet, while\r\nEzekiel read to him--his other son was engaged in superintending\r\nthe business of the farm; but when the hour of tea approached,\r\nhe joined the circle in the parlour with a smiling countenance,\r\ncheeks glowing with health, and an appetite which appeared in no\r\nwise diminished by the exercise of the day. When I returned to my\r\nown lonely habitation, I could not avoid contrasting a little my\r\nsituation with that of my old friend. Happy Ephraim! said I, thou\r\nhast an excellent wife and dutiful daughter, to smooth the pillow\r\nof thy aching head, to hover with feathery footsteps around thy\r\npeaceful couch, and watch over thy slumbers with the assiduity of\r\nanxious love--thou hast two manly intelligent sons, to attend to thy\r\nbusiness, to protect thy interests, and support thy tottering steps;\r\nwhose only strife is that of kindness, whose only rivalship, which\r\nshall be most attentive to thee, each of whom would gladly say with\r\nthe poet,\r\n\r\n    Me, may the gentle office long engage\r\n    To rock the cradle of reposing age.--\r\n\r\nAnd when at last, in a good old age, thou shalt be gathered to\r\nthy fathers, a train of mourning relatives shall deposit with\r\ndecent care thy cherished remains in the narrow house appointed\r\nfor all living; while I stand alone in the world, an insulated,\r\ninsignificant being, for whom no one feels an interest, and whose\r\npains and pleasures are of consequence to no one; whose approach is\r\ngreeted with no smile, and whose departure excites no regret, and\r\nwhen the closing scene approaches, no kindred hand shall support\r\nmy throbbing temples, or prepare the potion for my feverish lip,\r\nbut mercenary eyes alone mark with ill disguised impatience the\r\nuncertain flutter of the lingering pulse, mercenary attendants\r\nonly receive, with frigid indifference, the last farewell of the\r\ndeparting spirit--\r\n\r\n    \"By strangers' hands my dying eyes be clos'd,\r\n    \"By strangers' hands my lifeless limbs compos'd.\"\r\n\r\nLost in a train of such like melancholy musings, and pondering on\r\nthe past, the present and the future, I had suffered my fire to\r\nbecome nearly extinguished, and the feeble glimmer of my untrimmed\r\ntaper faintly illumined my little study, when I was roused from my\r\nrevery by the entrance of Ezekiel and his sister: The good girl\r\nsaid she had remarked that I was more silent than usual, and as\r\nthe evening was fine, they had come over to see if I was unwell:\r\nthis little act of kindness, though in itself no way remarkable,\r\nyet coming at such a moment, affected me not a little.--But I must\r\nshake off this gloom and depression of spirit, I am not now to learn\r\nthat the world had much rather laugh _with_ or _at_ a man than mourn\r\nwith him; I did not sit down to lament the desolation of my own\r\nsituation, which cannot now be remedied; but to exhort the young\r\nto get married, to encourage them by the example of Ephraim, and\r\nto warn them of my own: \"Do nothing in a hurry,\" is an excellent\r\nmaxim in the main, but in some cases it is possible to use too much\r\ndeliberation; in the important business of taking a wife, many a man\r\nhas debated and deliberated, until the season for acting has passed\r\naway. An old fellow like myself has little to do in the world, but\r\nto talk for the benefit of his neighbours; and I would willingly\r\ndevote my experience to the service of the rising generation. I\r\nshould feel no objection to narrate the disastrous consequences of\r\nmy own superabundant caution in the affair of matrimony, and to\r\nenumerate the many eligible matches which have slipped through my\r\nfingers; the opportunities to form advantageous connexions which\r\nhave been unimproved in consequence of my hesitation and indecision,\r\nfor I have now no plans to be defeated or prospects blasted by a\r\nknowledge of my failings, and no vanity to be mortified by the\r\nexposure of my disappointments, but I am apprehensive the detail\r\nmight prove rather tedious and uninteresting; I may, however,\r\nmention a few circumstances attending my last attempts to obtain a\r\nhelp mate, if attempt it may be called. I had become acquainted in\r\nthe family of a respectable farmer, who had a daughter of a suitable\r\nage, and although I cannot say that\r\n\r\n    \"Grace was in all her steps, heaven in her eye,\r\n    \"In every motion, dignity and love,\"\r\n\r\nyet her correct and orderly deportment seemed to promise that she\r\nwould make an excellent wife; I was therefore pretty frequent in my\r\nvisits, and though on these occasions my discourse was principally,\r\nif not entirely, addressed to the parents, yet I kept a sharp\r\neye upon the daughter, in order to endeavour to form a tolerable\r\nestimate of her disposition and character; and as I had in those\r\ndays a handsome little estate at my own disposal, and was upon the\r\nwhole considered rather a promising young man, my company seemed\r\nalways very acceptable, to the father and mother at least.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, eight or ten months, perhaps, passed pleasantly\r\naway, and I was beginning to think that I might before long venture\r\nto address her with a little freedom and familiarity, preparatory\r\nto a serious negotiation when all my plans were defeated, and my\r\nvisionary castle crumbled into dust, by the precipitation of others.\r\n\r\nOne evening I was sitting with them as usual, when after a little\r\ntime the father and mother, on some occasion, absented themselves\r\nfrom the room, and left the daughter and myself together. As I had\r\nnot the most distant suspicion that there was any design in their\r\nmovements, and expected their return every moment, I took up the\r\nalmanack, (being fond of reading) and had just got cleverly through\r\nit, when they returned. I thought I remarked something particularly\r\nscrutinizing in the looks of the mother, but I believe she soon\r\ndiscovered that I had done nothing but read the almanack. On my\r\nnext visit, I felt no small trepidation, having a strong suspicion\r\nof what might occur; and, in fact, we were again soon left alone\r\ntogether--and now the consciousness of what was expected, kept me as\r\nsilent as ignorance had done before. In my distress I looked about\r\nfor the almanack, but they had taken it away. In vain I endeavoured\r\nto find something to say, my faculties seemed spell bound; and I\r\nsat, I know not how long, in a pitiable state of confusion and\r\nembarrassment, until my companion made some remark respecting the\r\nweather--this was a great relief. I immediately proceeded to treat\r\nof the weather in all its bearings, past, present and to come, and\r\nstrove to prolong the discussion until some one might come in,\r\nbut in vain--the subject at length became exhausted, and silence\r\nagain took place; which lasted so long, and became so glaringly\r\nridiculous, that in utter despair, I was upon the point of having\r\nrecourse to the weather again, when we were relieved by the entrance\r\nof company.\r\n\r\nDetermined never again to cut so silly a figure, I resolved to\r\nprovide against my next visit a fund of agreeable conversation.\r\nI accordingly brushed up my acquaintance with the philosophy of\r\nAristotle, and of the peripatetics generally; collected some\r\nanecdotes of the wise men of Greece, and, not to lack matters of\r\nmore recent date, stored my memory with a few amusing particulars\r\nrespecting Mary Queen of Scots, and of the court of Elizabeth:\r\nthus prepared, I ventured once more to make my appearance, but I\r\nhad no opportunity to say a word about Aristotle or the Queen of\r\nScots; it was rather late when I entered the room, and I found my\r\nintended in earnest conversation with a young man who had drawn\r\nhis chair very near to her: their discourse seemed to be of an\r\ninteresting nature, but they spoke in so low a tone, that I was\r\nunable to profit by their remarks; I observed at last, that they\r\nfrequently smiled when looking towards me, and as I love a cheerful\r\ncountenance, and smiling is certainly contagious, I smiled a good\r\ndeal too. This seemed wonderfully to promote their risibility, and\r\nmy laughter increasing in the same proportion, we had a deal of\r\nmerriment, although little or nothing was said: how long this might\r\nhave continued I know not, had not my intended father-in-law called\r\nme aside, and hinted that as the night was dark, and there was some\r\nappearance of rain, I had perhaps better return. I thanked him for\r\nhis truly paternal care, and accordingly took my departure in high\r\ngood humour, and the next week was informed that the young people\r\nwere married.\r\n\r\n  [_Rural Visiter._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIEW OF A GOSSIP.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Editor_--I send you the following account of a short inspection\r\nof a fellow creature, which, if it will convey any information to\r\nyour readers, you are at liberty to publish.\r\n\r\nI had the curiosity, as a neighbouring gossip was one day at my\r\nhouse, and while she happened to be napping on the sofa, to try if I\r\ncould obtain a view of her ear, the structure of which I had often\r\nspeculated about. With the aid of a good eye-glass I succeeded. It\r\nwas a curious piece of mechanism: the outside folding was of the\r\nusual size, but by long habit of eager listening, had acquired a\r\nkind of gaping shape, which seemed to bid an indiscriminate welcome\r\nto every sound. Next to this was a kind of whispering gallery,\r\nso extremely susceptible of noise, that one of my most careful\r\nbreathings was immediately reverberated to the tympanum, and though\r\nnot loud enough to awake the sleeper, it was evident that it made\r\nher dream of scandal. I was curious to know the construction of the\r\ntympanum, which vibrated so easily to an empty breath. I could see\r\nit plainly: for the long habit of extreme anxiety to receive every\r\nbreath that stirred, had pushed it forward to the very orifice of\r\nthe ear, where it seemed waiting in an agony of impatience for\r\nsomething new, and complaining grievously that all the tit-bits of\r\nintelligence had to pass such a distance before they could come to\r\nits hearing. Its make was curious: it was an extremely fine sieve\r\nof the most elastic materials. It was evidently constructed so\r\nthat every thing of the least weight should rebound as soon as\r\nit touched, and only those articles which were as light as air,\r\nshould enter. It was too fine to admit any thing larger than a\r\nbit of scandal. The whole external ear was designed to catch and\r\ncommunicate every thing audible, for it is a maxim with gossips as\r\nwell as others, that nothing is too poor for a nice hand to sift\r\nsome good from it. This sifting was the office of the tympanum:\r\nit was in a perpetual quiver. Its nice threads were constantly\r\nshaking to pieces what was too light to rebound, and too large to\r\nenter whole, and then dropping them to the receiver below. There\r\nwere a great many curious articles sticking in this sieve, which\r\nhad got half through but could go no further. There were little\r\npieces of serious and affecting family secrets, tales of distress,\r\ncullings from the little failings of good men, morsels of sermons,\r\ndrippings of church business, ends, middles and halves of people's\r\nsayings, anecdotes of funerals, with numerous suspicions, half heard\r\nhear-says, and suspicions of near-says.--All these had evidently\r\nbeen operated upon. A kind of scandalic acid had been at work on\r\nthose parts which had got within. They were partly decomposed;\r\ntheir seriousness had assumed a ridiculous aspect, their solidity\r\nhad become gaseous: what had been affecting, seemed now to be\r\nlaughable; what had appeared commendable, seemed now composed of\r\nso many disgusting materials as to be odious. Here I learned the\r\nreason which I never knew before, why it is that gossips hear so\r\nmany lectures upon the degrading, injurious, disreputable character\r\nof their pursuits, and so entirely without effect. These lectures\r\nnever passed their ears: their matter was too heavy not to rebound,\r\nor the truths too great to gain admission; or, if any detached parts\r\nchanced to enter, they were so broken by sifting, and so decomposed\r\nand changed by the very pungent acid within, as to retain nothing\r\nof their original seriousness, and become fit companions for the\r\nnice selections which passed before them.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the ear excited my curiosity to look for the mind\r\nwithin: whatever may be the difficulty of determining the seat of\r\nthe mind in persons of ordinary construction, the matter is clear,\r\nthat the gossip's mind must be as near to the vehicle of sound as\r\npossible. This is confirmed by observation; I found it just inside\r\nthe ear, where there was but a small space, to be sure, for its\r\noperation; but its dimensions were of no enlarged description. It\r\nhad evidently been made for some useful employment: its nerves\r\nwere strong, its perceptions quick, its action skilful; but it was\r\nmiserably contracted. Part of it, and plainly the best part, was\r\nruined by long inaction. It contained a few good ideas, grown rusty\r\nby long disuse, which evidently might have been made to appear\r\nrespectable, could they have been delivered from the stuff which\r\ncovered them. This mind was a complete factory in miniature: there\r\nwas its picking machine, its spinning machine, a contrivance for\r\nweaving, for shearing, for trimming; with dyes of every variety\r\nof shade. All these machines were so artfully combined, that you\r\ncould see nothing of the raw material after it once went to be\r\npicked, till it came out in an article nicely dressed and dyed for\r\ndistribution. There was a very smooth communication from the mind\r\nto the mouth, through which the different articles, as soon as\r\nfinished, were conveyed, to be _kindly_, and _complacently_, and\r\n_charitably_, rattled out to every one that should come. A peculiar\r\nexcellence of this mechanism was, that there seemed to be no refuse:\r\nevery thing was worked, every thing was turned to some account:\r\nthe motion here was perpetual, and acid was strangely used instead\r\nof oil to facilitate it. All around, there were receipts for the\r\nbest method of making a good story out of almost nothing; of how\r\nto extract something laughable from the most serious subjects; of\r\nhow to dye white into a good black, and how to find materials for\r\nmanufacturing, where no one would think of looking. The day-book\r\nwas a curiosity. \"April 1st, eked out of John B's apprentice two\r\nskeins of scandal about his master.\" \"Monday, learned a good deal\r\nfrom Mrs. C's cook about her mistress' private ways, and gained\r\na variety of nice bits, which, with a chain of good _home-spun_,\r\nwill make up a very good article.\" \"Tuesday, heard a whisper about\r\nsomething disagreeable in Mr. D's family, can't rest till I know\r\nmore about it; must send Sally into their kitchen to see what can\r\nbe picked up there. A few family quarrels would help finely just\r\nnow.\" \"Wednesday, caught the thread to the tale which I have been\r\ntrying these three months to unwind, it seems to lead to some noble\r\npickings.\" \"To-day, must go out and hear the news, and ask about\r\nthis marriage rumour.\"\r\n\r\nAs I was finishing my observations, a little neglected thing struck\r\nmy attention, which seemed to demand some notice. It was the\r\ngossip's conscience. It was a little, contracted, fantastical body,\r\nthat seemed extremely averse to noise and all kinds of disturbance;\r\nto avoid which, it had squeezed itself into a narrow corner, where,\r\nwith the help of several ingenious contrivances, it kept clear of\r\nall interference: it seemed to sleep almost all the time, in which\r\nit was assisted by the influence of numerous little nostrums which\r\nwere kept for the purpose. When conscience did sometimes awake,\r\n(as I conjectured) it was mostly on a Sunday, while there was but\r\nlittle doing, _comparatively_, when it looked about a little, made\r\nsome bustle, and went to sleep again perfectly satisfied. From\r\nappearance, I judged that conscience and the gossip had very little\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\nOne thing was remarkable about this mental factory, which was, the\r\nflourishing state of its business; a circumstance which seems the\r\nmore strange, because such establishments are so very numerous, and\r\ntheir productions so eminently worthless.\r\n\r\nNow, sir, having finished my description, permit me to ask, if\r\nthere is any thing to excuse the employment of gossips, great or\r\nsmall? Can the want of other occupation, or the amusement which this\r\naffords them, make amends for such degradation of themselves; such\r\nabominable trifling with their neighbour's character; such vexatious\r\nmeddling with other's business; such remorseless transformation of\r\ngood into evil; of secrets into public news; of the serious into the\r\nridiculous; of peace into disputing; as they are constantly guilty\r\nof? Ought not such persons to be universally shunned as public\r\nevils, and if a public law will do no good, should it not be the\r\nsecret resolution of every gossip-hater, to avoid as a pestilence,\r\nthe scandalous atmosphere of a scandalous tale-bearer?\r\n\r\nThere is a celebrated description of law which affords a good\r\noutline for the description of what of all things is most lawless.\r\nOf scandal, there can be no less acknowledged, than that her seat\r\nis in the temple of fame; her voice the confusion of the world;\r\nall things in earth and hell own her influence; the very least as\r\nfeeling her hate, and the greatest as not exempt from her power;\r\nboth men and women, and creatures of what condition soever, though\r\neach in different sort and manner, yet all with uniform consent,\r\ndetesting her as the pest of their peace and joy.

I have myself much to learn from\r\nobserving farmers, of longer experience, and whose attentions have\r\nbeen exclusively devoted to husbandry. Mine, since I became a\r\nfarmer, have been diverted by other pursuits; so that at intervals\r\nonly my thoughts have been turned to this subject.\r\n\r\nNo one doubts the importance of our profession; and the actual\r\nformation of our society is a declaration that improvements in it\r\nare necessary.--But the field of agriculture is of boundless extent;\r\nand though traversed for some thousands of years by the greater\r\nportion of the human race, yet by no one, nor by all combined, has\r\na complete survey been accomplished. Every year, and every day,\r\npresents something new: and even of old things, the practices of\r\nages, there still exist diversities of opinions. For instance,\r\nwhich is preferable, deep or shallow ploughing?--Should manures be\r\nspread on the surface, or be buried by the plough? If the latter, at\r\nwhat depth, to produce the greatest effect, with the most lasting\r\nfertility?--Should manure be applied in its rough, coarse, and\r\nunfermented state, or, by keeping and repeated turnings, be more\r\nor less rotted?--These are points which appear to me deeply to\r\naffect the interests of agriculture. On these therefore I will give\r\nyou my opinion, enlightened by the observations of intelligent\r\nhusbandmen. I will then advert to a few other topics which demand\r\nyour attention; _dwelling_ on one of them--Root crops for the Food\r\nof Live Stock--as lying at the foundation of an improved agriculture.\r\n\r\nI. _On Deep Ploughing and Manuring._\r\n\r\nFor myself, I entertain no doubt of the utility of deep ploughing;\r\nnot at once, in our lands in general, but by an increase of two\r\nor three inches at every annual ploughing, until the earth be\r\nstirred and pulverized to the depth of ten or twelve inches. Indian\r\ncorn, planted in such a mass of loosened earth, would not, I am\r\npersuaded, ever suffer by ordinary droughts.--Like a spunge, it\r\nwould absorb a vast quantity of rain water, and become a reservoir\r\nto supply the wants of that and all other plants.--Nothing is\r\nmore common in a dry summer, than the rolling of the leaves of\r\ncorn; and that circumstance is often mentioned as an evidence of\r\nthe severity of the drought. This rolling of the leaves of Indian\r\ncorn, is the consequence, in part, of scant manuring, but still\r\nmore of shallow ploughing. Few, perhaps, are aware of the depth\r\nto which the roots of plants will penetrate in a deeply loosened\r\nearth. A gentleman,[11] much inclined to agricultural inquiries and\r\nobservations, informed me, near fifty years ago, that seeing some\r\nmen digging a well, in a hollow place, planted with Indian corn,\r\nthen at its full growth, he stopped to examine how far its roots had\r\ndescended; and he traced them to the depth of nine feet. The soil\r\nwas an accumulation of rich earth which had run or been thrown into\r\nthe hollow.\r\n\r\n  [11] Peter Oliver, Esq. then a Judge of the Superior Court of\r\n  Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe seed of the common turnip, sown in warm weather, and on\r\na soil sufficiently moist, I have known to vegetate in about\r\neight-and-forty hours; and in only four or five days afterwards, I\r\nfound the plants had sent down roots to the depth of four or five\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nI have often noticed forest trees blown down by violent winds, whose\r\nroots, of the same species, were very differently formed. Such as\r\nhad grown in grounds having a hard, impenetrable pan of clayey\r\ngravel, at the depth of twelve or eighteen inches from the surface,\r\nexhibiting a flat mass of roots; while others, torn up from a deep\r\nloam, or loamy gravel, showed downward roots of several feet in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nAbout five months ago, I received from England a pamphlet written\r\nby one of the most distinguished agricultural writers in that\r\ncountry--Arthur Young. It was a lecture read, a few years before,\r\nto the British Board of Agriculture, of which Mr. Young was the\r\nSecretary. Its title is, \"On the Husbandry of three celebrated\r\nBritish Farmers, Messrs. Bakewell, Arbuthnot and Ducket,\"--all\r\neminent for genius, enterprise, application, and long experience. It\r\nwas to do honour to their memories, \"and to bring to recollection\r\nthe means by which those celebrated practitioners, in the first\r\nand most important of all arts, carried their agriculture to a\r\nperfection unknown before,\" that the lecture was written and\r\npublished. And this, Mr. Young observes, would be more peculiarly\r\nuseful, because those men, \"confining themselves to practice alone,\r\nhad left no register of their own meritorious deeds.\" I will\r\npresent to you the substance of the information contained in this\r\npamphlet, as in itself very important, and because the practice of\r\nArbuthnot and Ducket has a direct bearing on the points I am now\r\nconsidering--DEEP PLOUGHING and MANURING.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Ducket had sand, and sandy soils alone, to deal with; but\r\nArbuthnot's land classed among those harsh, wet, tenacious loams,\r\nwhich are usually called clay, and ought to be esteemed such,\r\nrelative to every circumstance that attaches to difficulty and\r\nmanagement.\" Passing by what Mr. Young says of Arbuthnot's draining\r\noperations, I content myself with mentioning the principal of that\r\nimprovement: \"Lay your land dry, whatever may be the method pursued,\r\nbefore you attempt any thing else.\"\r\n\r\n\"In respect to tillage, Mr. Arbuthnot carried it to great\r\nperfection: He invented a swing plough for a pair of horses and the\r\ngeneral depth of six inches, and a much larger one with wheels, for\r\ngaining the depth of 12, and even of eighteen, for some peculiar\r\ncrops, especially madder. Upon the advantages of deep ploughing he\r\nnever had the least hesitation; but always declared that in all\r\nhe had read or heard, he never met with one argument against the\r\npractice that had with him the smallest weight.\"--\"In the essential\r\noperation of ploughing, he considered one earth [that is, one\r\nploughing] well timed, and of a right depth, as being much more\r\nefficacious than that repetition of tillage so common in every\r\ndistrict.\"[12]\r\n\r\n  [12] The repetition of tillage here reprobated, refers, I presume,\r\n  to the numerous ploughing given by many English farmers, at that\r\n  period, preparatory to the putting in of their crops; which the\r\n  single, deep and \"efficacious\" ploughing of Arbuthnot rendered\r\n  unnecessary.--Were our ploughing for Indian Corn and Root Crops\r\n  alike _deep_ and _efficacious, before planting_, shallow tillage\r\n  (called horse hoeing) with light ploughs, during their growth, would\r\n  suffice.\r\n\r\nA judicious rotation, or round of crops, has long been considered,\r\nin England, essential to good husbandry: and so it is by skilful\r\nfarmers in our own country; particularly in the middle States,\r\nwhere clover, so highly important in the rotation, has, for more\r\nthan thirty years, been rendered wonderfully productive, by the\r\napplication of plaster of Paris. The most usual course in England\r\nhas been (excepting on stiff clayey soils) first year turnips,\r\nmanured and kept clean by hoeing; the second year barley, with\r\nclover seed; the third year the clover mown for hay; and its second\r\ncrop, at wheat seed time, ploughed in, and, where necessary to fill\r\nthe seams, the ground harrowed, the wheat sown, and then harrowed\r\nin. This is called \"wheat upon a clover lay.\"--But by the long and\r\nfrequent repetition of clover, (that is, once in _four_ years)\r\nin their rotations, lands in England became (as they express it)\r\n\"sick of clover:\" and I have been informed that some lands in our\r\nmiddle States, long subjected to the like application of clover,\r\nexhibit like symptoms of disease or failure. But Mr. Arbuthnot\r\nintroduced clover once in _three_ years, without suffering by such\r\nmore frequent repetition. \"He attributed the failure of this plant\r\nto shallow and ill-executed ploughing; the result (says Mr. Young)\r\njustified his opinion.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Young mentions a lecture he had read to the Board of\r\nAgriculture, \"on the means by which a farm can be made, by a right\r\nproportion of all the products, to support itself, without foreign\r\nassistance, in a state of high fertility, a question depending on\r\nthe quantity or weight of dung resulting from the consumption in\r\nlitter of a given weight of straw.\" This lecture I have not seen.\r\nBut he considers the question as successfully decided, in Mr.\r\nArbuthnot's practice, in the following manner; 134 sheep and 30\r\nlambs were turnip fed, in a pen on a headland, well littered with\r\nstraw: in six weeks they required nearly six tons of straw [to give\r\nthem clean and comfortable beds:] and in that time made 40 tons\r\nof dung, equal to that brought from London [stable dung it is to\r\nbe presumed.] So every ton of litter produced near seven tons of\r\ndung.--But this weight must have been obtained chiefly by the earth\r\nof the headland absorbing the urine, of which, when fed on turnips,\r\nsheep make great quantities, and being finally mixed with their\r\ndung and litter. This recital reminds me of the recommendation, in\r\nmy address to this Society, in May, 1818, to carry earth into the\r\nbarn yard, once in every two weeks, from spring to autumn; adding to\r\nevery layer of earth a coat of litter. I should then have advised a\r\nplentiful spreading of litter, had I not known that our courses of\r\nhusbandry in Essex yielded very little straw.\r\n\r\nIn the same communication to the Society, I presented my ideas\r\non the proper application of manure; to wit, _always to bury it\r\nup quickly, when carried to the field_, to prevent great loss by\r\nits exposure to the sun and air; remarking, that the essence of\r\nmanure was lost, not by _sinking_ into the earth below the roots\r\nof cultivated plants, but by _rising_ into the atmosphere, and so\r\nfleeing away. Here, also, I have the satisfaction of seeing the\r\ntheory I had formed nineteen years ago (in the manner suggested\r\nin that communication) supported by the opinions and practices of\r\nsuch eminent agriculturists as Messrs. Arbuthnot and Ducket. After\r\nnoticing Arbuthnot's cultivation of madder, an article requiring a\r\nrich soil and extremely deep tillage, Mr. Young says, \"there was\r\none circumstance in his management, which, being applicable to more\r\nimportant articles, merits a more durable attention; this is, the\r\ndepth to which he ploughed in the dung: his tillage went to that of\r\neighteen inches; and he conceived there was no danger of losing,\r\nby this circumstance, either _vegetable_ or _animal_ manures, as\r\n_their_ tendency, contrary to all _fossil_ ones, was not to _sink_,\r\nbut to _rise_ in the atmosphere.\" Fossil manures are lime, marl,\r\nplaster of Paris, and other substances dug out of the earth, which\r\nincrease the productive powers of soils.\r\n\r\nMr. Ducket's manner of applying dung, although his was a sand farm,\r\nwas similar to Mr. Arbuthnot's.--\"Immediately connected with the\r\ndepth of tillage, is that to which dung may be safely deposited. He\r\n[Mr. Ducket] had not the least apprehension of losing it by deep\r\nploughing; but freely turned it down to two or three times the depth\r\ncommon among his neighbours.\" Yet Mr. Young says, that farmers (and\r\ngood farmers too) persist in a contrary practice. But he adds,\r\n\"Enlightened individuals, thinly scattered, know better: having\r\nconvinced themselves that Mr. Ducket's practice is not only safe but\r\nbeneficial;\" and then names one who \"ploughs in his dung as deeply\r\nas his ploughs can go, turning it in nine inches, and would bury it\r\ntwelve, did he stir to such a depth.\"\r\n\r\nConfirmatory of the correctness of the practice of these two\r\ncelebrated English farmers, is the fact stated by Mr. John Sinclair,\r\nPresident of the British Board of Agriculture, in his account of the\r\nImproved Scottish Husbandry. He mentions one farmer who ridged his\r\ncarrot ground, and buried the manure sixteen or seventeen inches\r\ndeep, the ridges thirty inches wide. This farmer preferred, as a\r\nmanure, a well prepared compost of peat-moss[13] and dung, ten tons,\r\nor double cart-loads, per English acre. \"The dung (or compost) being\r\nat the bottom, makes the tap root of the carrot push immediately\r\ndown, and swell to an enormous size; the roots being often sixteen\r\ninches in girt, and 18 or twenty inches in length.\"\r\n\r\n  [13] In Scotland their peat-lands are called peat-mosses.\r\n\r\nTo return to Mr. Ducket. His deep ploughing (says Mr. Young) was\r\nnot practised above once in two or three years, and the successive\r\ntillage shallow. \"By such deep ploughing, seldom given, Mr. Ducket\r\nconceived that a due degree of moisture was preserved in his _light_\r\nland, by means of which his crops were flourishing in seasons\r\nof drought which destroyed those of his neighbours: and no one\r\ncould more severely condemn the ideas which governed the Norfolk\r\nfarmers, in leaving what they called their _pan_ unbroken at the\r\ndepth only of 4 or 5 inches.--The operation of ploughing he thought\r\ncould scarcely be given too seldom, provided when given it was done\r\neffectively: and he always carried this paucity of tillage as far\r\nas circumstances would permit: thus I have known him put in seven\r\ncrops with only four ploughings.\" In another part of his lecture,\r\nMr. Young says, \"If I were to name the circumstance which more than\r\nany other governed his (Mr. Ducket's) practice, I should say that\r\nthe whole was founded in trench ploughing; and that the principle\r\nwhich governed this practice (a principle thoroughly impressed upon\r\nhis mind, as well as on the minds of those who draw intelligent\r\nconclusions) was that of giving as little tillage as possible to\r\nsandy soils.\"\r\n\r\n\"The next circumstance which I shall advert to (says Mr. Young)\r\nin the husbandry of Mr. Ducket, is the use of _long, fresh dung_,\r\ninstead of that which in common management is turned and mixed till\r\nit becomes _rotten_: and in justice to his memory, I shall read the\r\nshort recital of his practice, as I printed it three-and-twenty\r\nyears ago. \"Dependent on the Trench-Plough,[14] is Mr. Ducket's\r\nsystem of dunging. He conceives, and I apprehend very justly, that\r\nthe more dunghills are stirred and turned over, and rotted, the\r\nmore of their virtue is lost. It is not a question of straw merely\r\nwetted; but good _long_ dung he esteems more than that quantity of\r\n_short_ dung, which time will convert the former to. _Two_ loads\r\nof _long_ may become _one_ of _short_; but the two are much more\r\nvaluable than the one. Without the Trenching-plough, however, his\r\nopinion would be different. If long dung is ploughed in, in the\r\ncommon manner, with lumps and bundles sticking out at many places\r\nalong every furrow, which lets the sun and air into the rest that\r\nseems covered, he thinks, so used, it is mostly lost, or given\r\nto the winds: in such a case, short rotted manure will be better\r\ncovered, and should be preferred. But with his plough nothing of\r\nthis happens; and it enables him to use his dung in such a state as\r\ngives him a large quantity instead of a small one. The good sense\r\nof these observations must be obvious at the first blush.\" Mr.\r\nYoung adds--\"_The use of_ FRESH _instead of_ ROTTEN _dung, is, in\r\nmy opinion, one of the greatest agricultural discoveries that has\r\nbeen made in the present age_.\" He then states a striking experiment\r\nmade by himself--67 small cart loads of fresh yard dung produced\r\ntwo successive crops of potatoes, yielding together 742 bushels;\r\nat the same time, the same quantity of yard dung, after 6 months\r\nrotting, yielded 708 bushels, leaving [to the fresh long dung] a\r\nsuperiority of 34 bushels. But had the fresh dung been kept as long\r\nas the other, it would have required at least twice, perhaps thrice\r\nas much, to have produced the quantity used.\" [That is, twice or\r\nthree times 67 loads of fresh long dung, if kept and often turned\r\nand mixed to produce fermentation and rotting, would have shrunk,\r\nor been reduced, to 67 loads of short rotten dung.] \"If the crops\r\ntherefore had been only equal, still the advantage [of the fresh\r\ndung] would have been most decisive.\"\r\n\r\n  [14] The Trench-Plough of Mr. Ducket's invention was so admirably\r\n  contrived as completely to bury whatever was intended to be turned\r\n  in. Mr. Young says he saw him turn down a crop of rye, six feet\r\n  high, so that not an atom was left visible; and yet the depth\r\n  did not exceed eight inches. Trench ploughing has sometimes been\r\n  effected in this country by a second plough following in the same\r\n  furrow after the first, and going a few inches deeper.\r\n\r\n\"I shall not quit (says Mr. Young) the husbandry of two men who\r\ncarried tillage, on soils so extremely different, to its utmost\r\nperfection, without remarking the circumstances in which they\r\nagreed. Both were equal friends to deep ploughing; both rejected\r\nthe common repetition of tillage, and reduced the number of their\r\noperations to a degree that merits attention; both rejected\r\nfallows; and both ploughed deeply for depositing manure, without\r\nany apprehension of losing it. These are very important points in\r\nPractical Agriculture.\"\r\n\r\nTo this account of the successful practices of these two celebrated\r\nEnglish farmers, it may be useful to subjoin a few observations. I\r\nhave thought it proper so far to present them in detail, in order\r\nto develope principles; not expecting a _precise_ adoption of\r\ntheir practices; which indeed, without their or similar superior\r\nploughs and other implements, would be impracticable: but with such\r\ninstruments as we possess, or may easily obtain, we can materially\r\nincrease the depth of our ploughing, and I hope contrive effectually\r\nto cover our manure. _This should be wholly applied to Tillage\r\nCrops_; for which the manuring should be so ample as to ensure a\r\nsuccession of good crops through the whole rotation, without the\r\naid of any additional manure, especially for wheat, rye, barley or\r\noats: for besides increasing the seeds of weeds (with which all our\r\nlands are too much infested) such additional manuring, _immediately_\r\napplied to the small grain crops, renders them more liable to injury\r\nfrom mildews. Of this I am fully satisfied, as well from numerous\r\nstatements of facts which I have seen in books of husbandry,\r\nas from the circumstances under which remarkable mildews have\r\notherwise been noticed. One of our countrymen, who wrote a short\r\nessay on the subject prior to the American Revolution, has given\r\nthe only solution of the causes of mildews that has ever appeared\r\nsatisfactory to me: perhaps at some future time I may find leisure\r\nto show the correspondence of facts with his principles.[15]\r\n\r\n  [15] This essay, subscribed \"A New-England-Man,\" is published in the\r\n  2d volume of the Memoirs of the Philadelphia Society of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n  (To be continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Farmers._--In the winter of 1818-19, a gentleman in this city\r\nmade the following experiment. He placed a turkey in an enclosure\r\nabout four or five feet long, two feet wide, and three or four feet\r\nhigh. He excluded as much light as he could without preventing a\r\ncirculation of air, and fed the turkey with soft brick broken into\r\npieces, with charcoal also broken, and with six grains of corn per\r\nday. Fresh water was daily supplied. The box or coop in which the\r\nturkey was placed, he always locked up with his own hands, and is\r\nperfectly confident that nobody interfered with the experiment.\r\n\r\nAt the end of one month he invited a number of his neighbours among\r\nothers two physicians. The turkey, now very large and heavy, was\r\nkilled and opened by the physicians, and was found to be filled up\r\nfull with fat. The gizzard and entrails were dissected, and nothing\r\nwas found but a residuum of charcoal and brick. To conclude the\r\nexamination satisfactorily, the turkey was eaten, and found to be\r\nvery good.\r\n\r\nLast winter he again repeated the experiment with the same success.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance by which he was induced to make the experiment\r\nis a very curious one. One of his neighbours informed him, that\r\nbeing driven from the city by the fever of 1793, his family\r\nrecollected that some fowls that had lived in a kind of loft over\r\nhis workshop, had been forgotten in the hurry of their removal, and\r\nwould certainly be starved. They were absent six or eight weeks,\r\nand on the retiring of the pestilence returned. To their great\r\nastonishment, the fowls were not only alive, but very fat, although\r\nthere was _nothing but charcoal and shavings_ that they could\r\nhave eaten, and some water that had been left in the trough of a\r\ngrindstone had supplied them with drink.\r\n\r\n  [_Nat. Recorder._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Introduction of Glass Making in France._\r\n\r\n(From Parke's Chymical Essays.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe government of France, in the early part of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, took great pains to improve the manufacture of glass, and\r\nordained that none but gentlemen, or the sons of the nobility,\r\nshould be allowed to exercise the trade, or even to work as\r\nartificers in the manufactories of this most highly esteemed\r\ncommodity.--In consequence of this injunction, a company of persons,\r\nall born gentlemen, was incorporated, and obtained many important\r\nprivileges and immunities from the state; particularly that of being\r\nallowed to work at this curious art without derogating from their\r\nnobility. It is indeed asserted by the writer,[16] who is the best\r\nauthority we have on this subject, that there never was an instance\r\nof any one being attainted, to whom these privileges had been\r\ngranted; for they conducted themselves so irreproachably, that these\r\norders were invariably transmitted inviolate to their posterity. In\r\nthe year 1453, Anthony de Brossord, Lord of St. Martin, and prince\r\nof the blood royal, finding the business of glass making to be so\r\nconsiderable; and knowing that it did not derogate from nobility,\r\nobtained a grant from the Prince to establish a glass house in his\r\nown county, with prohibition of any other; and in consequence of\r\nthis, the elder sons of that family continued uninterruptedly to\r\nexercise the art till the latter end of the sixteenth century, when\r\nthe proprietor was killed while commanding a troop at the siege of\r\nChartres.--On the death of this individual the younger sons of the\r\nsame family undertook to carry on the art, and continued in it for\r\nmore than a century. Whether the trade continues still in the same\r\nline, I have not been able to ascertain.\r\n\r\n  [16] Blancourt.\r\n\r\nAn ancient family of the name of _Vaillant_, also obtained the\r\ngrant of a glass house, as a recompense for their valour and public\r\nservices, together with a poignard d'or, on azure, for their\r\narms.--Mr. Blancourt, who long resided in France, likewise notices,\r\nthat at the time he wrote, they had many other great families among\r\nthem, who were descended from gentleman glass-makers that had\r\ndeclined following the art; and that some of these had been honoured\r\nwith purple, and with the highest dignities and offices in the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n_Anecdote of Anthony Benezet_,\r\n\r\n     Not inserted in Vaux's interesting Memoir of that Philanthropist.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after the arrival of the Chevalier Luzerne, minister from\r\nthe court of France, Benezet called on him with a French copy of\r\nBarclay's Apology, with a view of informing him of the principles of\r\nthe Society of Friends. The minister being a Knight of Malta, and of\r\ncourse at enmity with the Turks, appeared much surprised that any\r\nprofessed Christians should object to the destruction of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire--which increased on being informed that his profession\r\nwould not permit taking the life of any man: on which the minister\r\nobserved that it was _very good_, but too _straight_ for him to\r\nobject to killing a Musselman.\r\n\r\nThe interview prepared the way for frequent visits to the\r\nembassador, who always received him with pleasure, the latter often\r\nobserving that he had but a small body; but added, extending his\r\narms nearly at full length, as if to embrace a large object--\"_Oh\r\nwhat a capacious soul he possesses!_\"--evincing by his whole\r\nconduct, that he valued him as an extraordinary man, possessing true\r\nChristian principles.\r\n\r\n  G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The English, a Foreign Tongue._--We extract the following from a\r\nFrench paper:\r\n\r\n     \"An etymologist has lately published the following analysis\r\n     of the English language. Its vocabulary, he says, is composed\r\n     of 6621 words of Latin origin, 4361 of French, 2068 of Saxon,\r\n     1288 of Greek, 660 of Dutch, 229 of Italian, 117 of German, 11\r\n     of Gaelic, 83 of Spanish, 81 of Danish, 18 of Arabic, besides\r\n     many others of ancient Teutonic, Hebrew, Swedish, Portuguese,\r\n     Flemish, Russian, Egyptian, Persian, Cimbrian, and Chinese!! The\r\n     same etymologist pretends, that in Shakspeare, Pope, Swift, and\r\n     Milton, _there are not many more than a hundred words purely\r\n     English_!\"\r\n\r\nSo that it would appear, that when we meet an acquaintance in the\r\nstreet, and accost him with \"How do you do this morning?\" and he\r\nreplies \"pretty well, I thank you,\" we are probably speaking half\r\na dozen languages at once. What \"learned Thebans\" we must be! In\r\nthis way a man who has a tolerable understanding of _Dilworth's\r\nspelling book_ must be no inconsiderable linguist while one, who\r\ncan read _Johnson at sight_, must be a perfect _Polyglot_. The poor\r\nBurgeois gentilhomme was quite amazed to find, that he had been\r\nspeaking _prose_ all his life without knowing it; and we are no\r\nless astonished on discovering that we had been talking _Russian_,\r\n_Egyptian_, _Persian_, _Cimbrian_, _Teutonic_, and _Chinese_, for\r\nyears, without having ever dreamed of it. There have been great\r\ncontroversies among the learned as to what was that formidable\r\ndialect, which arose at Babel, out of the confusion of tongues, but\r\nafter this discovery we can have no doubt that it is that very\r\nEnglish which we all speak, and instead of High Dutch, which some\r\nhave supposed was the language used by Adam in Paradise, we do now\r\nverily believe, that it was that _pure English_, of which so few\r\ntraces have been left!--_Lou. Adv._\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_A Stitch in time, saves nine._\"--A celebrated French writer on\r\npolitical economy, M Say, has this story:--'Being in the country,\r\nI had an example of one of those small losses which a family is\r\nexposed to through negligence. For the want of a latchet of small\r\nvalue, the wicket of a barn yard looking to the fields, was often\r\nleft open; every one who went through, drew the door to; but having\r\nno means to fasten it, it remained flapping: the poultry escaped,\r\nand were lost. One day a fine pig got out and ran into the woods.\r\nImmediately all the world was after it; the gardener, the cook, the\r\ndairy-maid, all run to recover the swine. The gardener got sight\r\nof him first,--and jumping over the ditch to stop him, he sprained\r\nhis ancle, and was confined a fortnight to the house.--The cook, on\r\nher return, found all the linen she had left to dry by the fire,\r\nburned; and the dairy-maid having run off before she had tied up\r\nthe cows, one of them broke the leg of a colt in the stable. The\r\ngardener's lost time was worth twenty crowns, valuing the pain at\r\nnothing; the linen burned, and the colt spoiled, were worth as much\r\nmore. Here a loss of forty crowns and much pain, trouble, vexation,\r\nand inconvenience, for want of a latch, which would not cost three\r\npence, and all through careless neglect.'\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rats._--The following curious mode of catching rats is extracted\r\nfrom the works of Muller, an apothecary of Weringerode, in Germany:--\r\n\r\nProcure a large cask, and place it in the vicinity of places\r\ninfested with rats. During the first week, this vessel is employed\r\nonly to allure the rats to visit the solid top of the cask, by\r\nmeans of boards or planks arranged in a sloping direction to the\r\nfloor, which are to be strewed with oatmeal daily, or any other\r\nfood grateful to the palate.--Being thus lulled into security,\r\nand accustomed to find a regular supply for their meals, a skin\r\nof parchment is substituted for the wooden top of the cask, and\r\nthe former is cut for several inches in the centre in transverse\r\ndirections, so as to yield on the slightest pressure. At the same\r\ntime, a few gallons of water, to the depth of six or seven inches,\r\nare poured into the empty cask, in the middle of which a brick\r\nor stone is placed, so as to project one or two inches above the\r\nfluid, and afford to one rat a place of refuge. These measures being\r\ntaken, the top of the cask should be furnished with the proper\r\nbaits, in order to induce the marauders to repeat their visits. No\r\nsooner does one plunge through the section of the parchment into\r\nthe vessel, than it retreats to the brick or stone, and commences\r\nits lamentations for relief. Others follow, and share the same\r\nfate. A dreadful conflict then commences to obtain possession of\r\nthe dry assylum. Battles follow in rapid succession, attended with\r\nsuch loud and noisy shrieks, that all the rats in the neighbourhood\r\nhasten to the fatal spot, where they experience similar disasters.\r\nThus, hundreds may be caught by stratagem, which might be greatly\r\nfacilitated by exposing a living rat taken in a trap, or purchased\r\nfrom a professional rat catcher.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Important to Millers._--A very valuable machine has lately\r\nbeen invented (and is now in operation) by Richard French, of\r\nMorrisville, (Pa.) for cleansing all kinds of grain and grass seeds.\r\nThis machine cleanses the grain completely of the white cap, and at\r\nthe same time rubs off the dust that always adheres to grain, and is\r\nthe cause of specks in flour. The grain at the same time receives a\r\nfine polish. It operates equally on rye and buckwheat, cleansing it\r\nfrom all the dust and fuz which darken and cause grit in the flour,\r\nand are so liable to fret the bolting cloth. It is the opinion of\r\na number of millers, that one barrel of flour may be obtained more\r\nfrom every hundred bushels of wheat, cleaned by this machine, than\r\nfrom the same quantity in the usual way. This machine will remain at\r\nMorrisville, for public inspection, a few weeks, after which it will\r\nbe removed to Brandywine. Millers and others, who wish to make more\r\nand better flour, as there is no loss of grain, are invited to call\r\nand see the machine in operation. I believe they will not regret the\r\ntime and trouble of so doing.\r\n\r\n  [_Trenton paper._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rhode Island._--The thrifty little state of Rhode Island is, at\r\nthis time, the most prosperous of any in the Union, notwithstanding\r\nthe multitude of small banking institutions that abound there, from\r\nthe force of domestic industry applied to manufactures; which, in\r\ndespite of every obstacle, is in a condition that must be considered\r\na happy one, compared with that of most other places; a most rigid\r\neconomy, in some measure, supplying the want of public protection,\r\nexcept in the people themselves--who chiefly consume the products of\r\ntheir respective neighbourhoods.--The balance of trade is generally\r\nin favour of the state, and the want of specie is not felt by\r\nthose who have a right to demand it, for the banks are in a very\r\n_comfortable_ state.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Maine._--The first organization of the government of the state of\r\nMaine, took place on Wednesday, May 31st, at Portland. John Chandler\r\nwas unanimously chosen Speaker of the Senate, and Benjamin Ames\r\nchosen Speaker of the House of Representatives, also unanimously.\r\nGeneral William King elected governor, by 20,000 votes out of\r\nsomething over that number, was qualified next day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oil Stones._--Within a few weeks past a body of very superior\r\noil-stones has been discovered in the neighbourhood of Easton,\r\n(Penn.) We believe they were first discovered on the farm of\r\nGeorge Ibrie, Esq. on the river Lehigh, in Williams township. The\r\nbed, however, is not confined to that farm alone, but extends to\r\na considerable distance on each side of the Lehigh. They have\r\nheretofore been found lying on the surface of the earth, and it\r\nis matter of astonishment they were not sooner discovered.--The\r\ncarpenters of that place have almost entirely substituted them for\r\nthe Turkey stones heretofore used for setting tools; believing them\r\nto be superior to those of Turkey, and infinitely better than those\r\ngotten near Oley, which they somewhat resemble in colour.--The\r\ndiscovery is certainly valuable to the mechanics, as the Turkey\r\nstones have sold there for 75 or 100 cents, and the Oley stones at\r\n25 cents per lb.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Longevity of the Land Tortoise._--An article dated Sunbury, (Penn.)\r\nJune 15, says, that as a person was lately rolling logs near\r\nShamokin creek, he discovered a land tortoise, and through curiosity\r\npicked it up, when the following engraving was observed upon the\r\nunder shell:\r\n\r\n  \"Thomas Musgrave, 1712;\"\r\n\r\nand immediately below, in large capitals,\r\n\r\n  \"ROBERT HUNTER, 1790\"--\r\n\r\nthe former having been engraved 108, and the latter 30 years ago. He\r\nengraved his own name below, and set the Recorder of ages at liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Great crop._--A.

The number of\r\npatients during the year ending April 22, 1820, was 945. The deaths\r\nwere 52. Persons relieved 81. Cured 428. Remain 209. Eloped 23.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Salt water._--The whole western country seems to be _under_-flowed\r\nwith salt water. Some late borings through the rock, at depths of\r\nfrom 259 to 317 feet, at Cannonsburg, Pa. have been completely\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fire at Savannah._--An advertisement from the London Phenix Fire\r\nOffice states, that the loss occurring in Savannah, by the great\r\nfire of January last, swept away every thing that had been received\r\nfor premiums during twelve years, and as much more.\r\n\r\n\r\n_British Revenue, &c._--The _ad valorem_ duty, on British\r\nmanufactured goods, exported from Liverpool, amounted, for the first\r\nquarter of the year 1819, to upwards of 13,000_l._ For the first\r\nquarter of 1820, the amount was only 5,700_l._ A great falling off,\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nAverage price of grain in England and Wales, from the returns up\r\nto the 15th April--Wheat, 69s. 2d.; Rye, 41s. 9d.; Barley, 36s.\r\n5d.--[Grain at these prices would afford a fine market for the\r\nsurplus product of the United States; but England will not receive\r\nour bread stuffs; she prefers to keep up, and to a most unreasonable\r\nextent, the market for her own agriculturists.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Origin of Almanacks._--The ancient Saxons used to engrave upon\r\ncertain square sticks, about a foot in length, the courses of the\r\n_moons_ for the whole year, whereby they could always certainly tell\r\nwhen the new moons, full moons, and changes, should happen; and such\r\ncarved sticks they called _Al-mon-aght_ (_all-mon-heed, i. e._)\r\nthe regard or observation of all the moons. There is in St. John's\r\nCollege, Cambridge, a Saxon almanack exactly answering to the above\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Iron Boat._--A London paper of May 4, says, that a passage boat, of\r\nmalleable iron, now plies on the Forth and Clyde Canal, in Scotland.\r\nIt is called the Vulcan, and succeeds to admiration. The length\r\nis 63 feet; beam, 13 feet; depth, 5 feet; draught of water, when\r\nlaunched, 22 inches abaft, and 19 inches forward--when fitted with\r\ncabins, &c. 37 and 25 inches--when laden with two hundred passengers\r\nand their baggage, under 48 inches, on an even keel. The weight of\r\niron employed was 12 tons 11-3/4 cwt. which is less than a wooden\r\nvessel of the same dimensions. The iron is of the kind called scrap.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Great Eclipse of the Sun_ will take place on the 7th of September\r\nnext. This eclipse will be visible over an extent of more than four\r\nmillions square leagues, a surface nearly equal to a sixth part of\r\nthe earth, and resembling a kind of oval of about 7500 leagues in\r\ncircumference, comprising all Europe, the western part of Asia, all\r\nAfrica, as far as to Monopotapa, and a part of North America. The\r\neclipse will last three hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord Thurlow._--This eminent lawyer's superiority of ability was\r\nvery early manifested both at school and at college. They extorted\r\nsubmission from his equals, and impressed his seniors with respect.\r\nThe following anecdote is told of him.--Having been absent from\r\nchapel, or committed some other offence which came under the\r\ncognizance of the dean of the college, who, though a man of wit, was\r\nnot remarkable for his learning. The dean set Thurlow, as a task, a\r\npaper in the Spectator to translate into Greek. This he performed\r\nextremely well, and in very little time; but instead of carrying it\r\nup to the dean, as he ought to have done, he took it to the tutor,\r\nwho was a good scholar, and a very respectable character. At this\r\nthe dean was exceedingly wroth, and had Mr. Thurlow convened before\r\nthe Masters and Fellows to answer for his conduct. Thurlow was\r\nasked what he had to say for himself. He coolly, perhaps improperly\r\nreplied, \"that what he had done proceeded not from disrespect, but\r\nfrom a feeling of tenderness for the dean; he did not wish to puzzle\r\nhim!\" The dean, greatly irritated, ordered him out of the room; and\r\nthen insisted that the Masters and Fellows ought immediately to\r\nexpel or rusticate him. This request was nearly complied with, when\r\ntwo of the Fellows, wiser than the rest, observed, that expelling or\r\nrusticating a young man for such an offence would perhaps do much\r\ninjury to the college, and expose it to ridicule; and that as he\r\nwould soon quit the college of his own accord to attend the Temple,\r\nit would be better to let the matter rest, than irritate him by so\r\nsevere a proceeding. This advice was at length adopted.\r\n\r\nSuch was the consciousness which Thurlow felt of his towering\r\nabilities, that long before he was called to the bar, he often\r\ndeclared to his friends that he would one day be Chancellor of\r\nEngland; and that the title he would take for his peerage, would be\r\nLord Thurlow, of Thurlow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Machine for crossing Rivers._--The mechanist, Xavier Michel,\r\nresiding at Offenbach, has invented a very simple and compact\r\nmachine, by the aid of which rivers may be crossed, and even the sea\r\nattempted, without any danger of sinking. It is nearly five feet in\r\ndiameter, when unfolded. An opening of about thirteen inches in the\r\ncentre is destined to receive the traveller. When dismounted, this\r\napparatus is easily transported from place to place--for its entire\r\nweight scarcely exceeds five pounds. This inventor has made a number\r\nof experiments on the Rhine, all of which have been crowned with\r\nentire success. He can make the machine move forward, or otherwise,\r\nat pleasure, and without any great exertion. In order more fully\r\nto prove the utility of his invention, M. Michel has determined to\r\nembark at Khel, and descend the Rhine to its mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cattle Scenting Rain._--Liable to long and parching droughts, the\r\nauthor of \"_Letters from Buenos Ayres, Chili_,\" &c. notices the\r\nwell-known instinct of cattle in scenting water at a wonderful\r\ndistance, and describes an occasion wherein it was displayed on the\r\napproach of rain, in a similar manner as if a river or spring had\r\nbeen found.\r\n\r\n\"The negroes were sent in different directions to see how far the\r\nscorched grass extended, and were at a considerable distance when\r\nthe Father Provincial cried out, 'Look at the oxen, they smell\r\nwater:' we all eagerly turned to the poor panting animals, and saw\r\nthem stretch out their necks and raise their heads towards the\r\nwest, and snuff the air in a manner as if they would be certain of\r\nobtaining drink could they but raise themselves in the air. At that\r\nmoment not a cloud nor a single breath of air was to be seen or\r\nfelt; but in a few minutes the cattle began to move about as if mad,\r\nor possessed by some invisible spirit, snuffing the air with most\r\nviolent eagerness, and gathering closer and closer to each other;\r\nand before we could form any rational conjecture as to what could\r\noccasion their simultaneous motion, the most tremendous storm came\r\non of thunder, lightning, and rain, I ever witnessed in my life.\r\nThe rain fell in perpendicular streams as if all the fountains of\r\nheaven were suddenly broke loose; so that, in the space of a very\r\nfew minutes, torrents of water rolled around us, and the cattle\r\neasily drank their fill at the spot on which they stood.\"--_Literary\r\nGazette._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Irish Bulls._--The secretary of a celebrated Agricultural Society\r\nin England, some years ago, in his rage for improvement, and not\r\nbeing overburdened with understanding, sent an order to a bookseller\r\nfor Mr. and Miss Edgeworth's essay upon _Irish Bulls_, for the use\r\nof their society, to assist the members in improving the breed of\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Modern Inventions._--The improvements made in all arts and sciences\r\nwithin the last 200 years have nearly doubled the present limitation\r\nof life, in that we live more in less time.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians were so ignorant of medicine, that, when any one was\r\nsick, they called in as many persons as possible to see him, that,\r\nif any one of them had the like distemper, he might say what was fit\r\nfor his cure.\r\n\r\nSurgery was much the oldest branch of physick which they practised.--\r\n\r\nÆsculapius was followed by a dog and a she-goat. The dog was taught\r\nto lick all ulcerated wounds, and the goat's milk was given for all\r\ndiseases of the stomach and lungs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Receipt to make Yeast._--Three gallons water, two quarts loose\r\nhops, boiled together about three hours in brass or bell metal,\r\nstrain them off from hops, and at once stir in a quart of flour.\r\nWhen cool stir in a pint of good yeast, and half a pound of brown\r\nsugar, to remain open in a piggin or jar 15 or 20 hours, and to be\r\nstirred often. Put it then in stone jugs about three fourths full,\r\ncork them well and place them in a cool situation. Your jugs ought\r\nto be of such a size only to contain yeast for the usual quantity of\r\nbread baked at a time. One gill of yeast is sufficient for a common\r\nsized loaf of bread, that is made from a plate full of flour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boots without Seams._--A patent has lately been obtained for the\r\nmanufacture of boots without seams.--For this purpose, the patentee\r\nproposes that the thigh of the beast should be flayed without\r\ncutting open, and afterwards dressed and curried upon blocks. The\r\nboot top upon the same principle is to be made of the shoulder,\r\nprepared in like manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The stanzas inserted below are ascribed, it is believed with\r\n     correctness, to the pen of the late Governor HOWELL, of New\r\n     Jersey. The occasion which gave rise to them, was that of his\r\n     leaving home to join the army which was embodied to suppress\r\n     the Western Insurrection. They breathe a delicacy of feeling,\r\n     and a warmth of attachment, alike honourable to the author as a\r\n     husband and a man. They likewise illustrate, very forcibly, the\r\n     true character of WAR, whose approach is witnessed with sadness\r\n     and sorrow, by all the endearing charities of domestic life.\r\n\r\n     I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOLDIER'S ADIEU.\r\n\r\n    Ah! Clara, cease--those silent tears\r\n      Steal down thy cheeks in vain;\r\n    Kind hope shall chase away thy fears,\r\n      Till I return again:\r\n    But wheresoe'er our route shall be,\r\n    My heart shall still encamp with thee.\r\n\r\n    Why should we lose the single hour,\r\n      Which time accords to love,\r\n    Suppress that sigh, I own its power,\r\n      Yet joy from hope improve:\r\n    But wheresoe'er our route shall be,\r\n    My heart shall still encamp with thee.\r\n\r\n    Let no foreboding fears alarm\r\n      That regulated mind,\r\n    Thy innocence shall shield from harm\r\n      Thy soldier far disjoined:\r\n    But wheresoe'er our route shall be,\r\n    My heart shall still encamp with thee.\r\n\r\n    Let idle tales of fancied wo,\r\n      Ne'er wake for me a fear,\r\n    Since honour calls, prepared I go,\r\n      Yet dread that parting tear:\r\n    But wheresoe'er our route shall be,\r\n    My heart shall still encamp with thee.\r\n\r\n    Start not my fair!--that morning gun\r\n      Proclaims 'tis dawn of day,\r\n    And now the Reveille's begun,\r\n      To hail the morning grey:\r\n    But wheresoe'er our route shall be,\r\n    My heart shall still encamp with thee.\r\n\r\n    The general-hark! Oh the adieu!\r\n      Permit a last embrace,\r\n    The troops they march, and I'll pursue,\r\n      Farewell that angel face:\r\n    But wheresoe'er our route shall be,\r\n    My heart shall still encamp with thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENING.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The dusky shadows from the east that rise,\r\n      Steal midway o'er the heavens; the blazing car\r\n    Of Day is sunk; and Sunset's gorgeous dyes\r\n      Fade fast away. Eve's solitary star,\r\n    Watching their golden pomp with kindling eye,\r\n      New trims her virgin lamp: th' unruffled tide\r\n    Gives back a liquid light, while shadows lie\r\n      Deep, broad and strong, the wood-crown'd shores beside.\r\n    How beautiful! all earthly passions fly\r\n      This consecrated hour. The distant bird\r\n    In some sequestered wild mourns on; the fire-fly\r\n      Lights her nuptial torch; the sounds that stirr'd\r\n    Die one by one away. An hour like this\r\n      Is balm unto the soul, steeps every sense in bliss.\r\n\r\n    Ω\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE EDITORS OF THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The following is taken from a manuscript book of rare pieces,\r\n     which I have been collecting for upwards of forty years. C. E.\r\n\r\n_On the Return of the New Year._\r\n\r\n    God's vast existence ne'er decays,\r\n      His age doth never grow,\r\n    Past, present, future, in his sight,\r\n      Are one eternal NOW.\r\n\r\n    Man measures out his fleeting state\r\n      By motions in the skies,\r\n    And like his own frail vesture, wears\r\n      With every hour that flies.\r\n\r\n    Successive moments make one day,\r\n      Successive days one year;\r\n    The moments past shall ne'er return,\r\n      Though seasons like appear.\r\n\r\n    Still a new spring shall bless the earth,\r\n      And a new harvest rise,\r\n    But the last year shall ne'er again\r\n      Revisit mortal eyes.\r\n\r\n    Old Time, with his keen-pointed scythe,\r\n      Consumes the life of man;\r\n    Our period's less'ning from the hour\r\n      Our beings first began.\r\n\r\n    Each year fulfills some new event\r\n      Heaven long decreed before,\r\n    Removes unnumbered lives away,\r\n      And gives unnumber'd more.\r\n\r\n    Soon shall the appointed angel stand\r\n      O'er earth, and air, and sea,\r\n    And swear by him that ever lives,\r\n      That time no more shall be.\r\n\r\n    Then shall the league of nature cease,\r\n      The sun forsake his way,\r\n    And years and ages lose their name,\r\n      In one eternal day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBANK NOTE EXCHANGE,\r\n\r\nAT PHILADELPHIA--_June 27th, 1820_.\r\n\r\n                                         Per cent Disc't.\r\n\r\n  U.
