Solomon had also accompanied them, for the purpose of visiting some\r\nrelatives who lived in the vicinity. Neither Phil nor Pat had ever been\r\nin St. John before, and they found the place full of attractions of no\r\ncommon order.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it may safely be said, that St. John possesses attractions\r\nsufficient to excite the interest even of those who have travelled\r\nfar and seen much, and can lay claim to far more experience than could\r\npossibly have been possessed by two lads like Phil and Pat.\r\n\r\nSituated as it is on a peninsula between two seas, and on a declivity\r\nwhich slopes steeply down on three sides, its houses rise one above\r\nanother, and thus produce an effect which is in the highest degree\r\nimposing to those approaching. Before the city and behind it two furious\r\nfloods pass and repass, in one place filling up the broad channel with\r\nsand, but in the other mingling with the torrent of a mighty river,\r\nwhich, after flowing for five hundred miles, at this place pours all its\r\naccumulated waters into the bay.\r\n\r\nAll around the city are many striking scenes; the sea, with its tides\r\nand currents; the sky, with its clouds and fogs; the rocky ledges, the\r\nsurf-beaten islands, and the far-folded headlands; the low marshes,\r\nand broad sand flats; the bold, rocky hills, whose summits, rising\r\none behind another, fade away in the distance;--and over all these an\r\never-changing atmosphere, which at one time veils all the scene in thick\r\nmists, and at another time gathers up all its clouds to lend additional\r\nglories to the setting sun.\r\n\r\nBut, amid all these objects of interest, one stands forth preeminent,\r\nand that is the river. After flowing for many a mile through every\r\nvariety of scenery, it at length approaches its termination, where,\r\nwithin the space of a few miles, it gathers together the extremes of the\r\ngrand and the beautiful. Here it expands into a broad lake, and receives\r\ninto itself, by a wide mouth, another tributary river; after which\r\nit contracts into narrow dimensions, and winds its way between rocky\r\nprecipices till it reaches the suburbs of the city. Here it expands once\r\nmore, and then, flowing onward a little farther, it comes to a place\r\nwhere towering cliffs rise abrupt, giving signs of some primeval\r\nconvulsion of nature, which has rent the solid rock asunder to open\r\na pathway for the waters. Here, through a narrow and gloomy gorge,\r\nit rushes onward, past rocky shores and between small islands, and at\r\nlength, with a majestic curve, sweeps into the harbor, and thence into\r\nthe bay.\r\n\r\nNow, the surface of that bay is forever changing, as the mighty tides\r\nebb and flow, and the difference between the extremes of its elevation\r\nis great. At low tide all the river pours in foam and fury through this\r\ngorge, forming what is called the Falls; at high tide, on the contrary,\r\nthe outer waters run swiftly up the river with resistless sweep; while\r\nbetween the two there is a time when the waters are so still that the\r\nmost fragile boat can pass with perfect safety in any direction.\r\n\r\nThe scene is magnificent. At the beginning of the Falls the river grows\r\nnarrow, showing two rocky islets on one side, and a promontory on the\r\nother. Then, after widening again, it once more contracts, and\r\nlowering cliffs of solid rock arise on either side. Across this abyss\r\na suspension bridge has been flung, from which there is a view full of\r\ngrandeur. Here at high tide the river may be seen rushing up; at low\r\ntide it may be seen pouring down with the fury of a cataract; while at\r\nintermediate tide may be seen steamers, and schooners, and scows, and\r\ntimber-rafts, and sail-boats, and row-boats, all passing through in\r\nperfect safety.\r\n\r\nAfter exhausting the possibilities of the place, Phil and Pat both\r\nsettled down upon the Falls as the one grand distinguishing feature of\r\nthe city, at least in their estimation. Bart’s house was not very far\r\naway, and so they used to come here often; sometimes sitting on the\r\nsuspension bridge, and watching the flood below, or the vessels passing\r\nunderneath, or the foam of the thunderous cataract; at other times\r\nscaling the sides of the precipice, and working their way down to the\r\nedge of the river, so as to look up from thence and watch the suspension\r\nbridge overhead, with the people and carriages that passed to and\r\nfro. Thus the whole immediate vicinity of the Falls became at length\r\nperfectly familiar to them, and there was not a single spot worth seeing\r\nwhich they had not thoroughly explored.\r\n\r\nWhen I say this, I must make an exception. There were some spots which\r\nyet baffled them. These were two islands which lay in the channel of the\r\nriver, and, when the flood poured down, received its shock upon their\r\nrocky borders. These islands lay out of the reach of the boys, and for\r\nthat reason became particularly attractive to them. An island is always\r\nan object of unutterable fascination to a boy; but these became\r\nstill more fascinating, for the reason that they seemed to be more\r\ninaccessible than was generally the case. At the same time they were\r\nvery provokingly near. From one shore the distance was so slight that\r\nit seemed almost possible to jump across. But the possibility was only\r\napparent; the island was in reality inaccessible, except by boat,\r\nat certain times of tide, and so Phil and Pat only found themselves\r\ntantalized by the sight of an object apparently so near, yet in reality\r\nso remote.\r\n\r\nEach of the boys began at length to be filled with a consuming desire to\r\nreach the islands, and each soon began to think over some plan by which\r\ntheir purpose might be effected. Of the two, Pat was the more eager;\r\nin fact, if it had not been for him, it is not at all likely that\r\nPhil would ever have felt the desire so strongly; but Pat seemed to\r\nbe completely carried away by this one feeling; and his excitement was\r\ngradually communicated to Phil, till at last one was as eager as the\r\nother to reach those inviting shores.\r\n\r\nAs for Bart, he was in a different position altogether. He had been\r\ntaken there once, and consequently knew all about them; and thus there\r\nwas no mystery to attract him. In the second place, his father had\r\nforbidden him, most positively and most solemnly, from ever having\r\nanything whatever to do with any boat above the Falls. The prohibition\r\nwas one which was so final, that the idea of disobeying it never for\r\none moment entered into his head; and when Pat had mentioned his wish\r\nto visit the islands, he had refused so positively, and had warned him\r\nagainst it so earnestly, that Pat from that moment never alluded to it\r\nagain in his presence. In this matter Phil was influenced by Pat, rather\r\nthan by Bart; that is to say, he listened rather to Pat’s enthusiastic\r\ndescriptions of those mysterious islands than to the somewhat\r\nunsatisfactory warning which Bart had given; and the only result of\r\nthat warning was, that he and Pat began to devise in secret some plan by\r\nwhich they might achieve their desire.\r\n\r\nThe result of this was, that Pat volunteered to go forth and make some\r\ninquiries about boats. There were plenty of boats above the Falls, and\r\nit was easy enough to procure one. The only difficulty was, that people\r\nmight not be willing to let one to inexperienced boys. But Pat was fully\r\na match for this emergency. He was ready with any amount of professions\r\nas to his ability to manage any boat; and indeed in such professions he\r\nwas not deceitful, for he could handle an oar as well as any boy of\r\nhis age. And so his offer was accepted very readily by Phil; and the\r\nconsequence was, that Pat took occasion to make his search, and made it\r\nwith such success that he at length found a boat every way adapted to\r\ntheir purpose. He did this, too, quite unknown to Bart.\r\n\r\nThis must not be considered as a violation of confidence, or anything\r\nof that sort; for Pat was, after all, not capable of direct deceit. The\r\nfact was, he regarded Bart’s objection as due to his father’s command,\r\nand that command he did not consider as at all binding either upon\r\nhimself or upon Phil. He did not suppose that there was any actual\r\ndanger, nor did he stop to think that Mr. Darner’s prohibition might\r\nbe founded upon wise precautions and a knowledge of the perils of the\r\nplace; for, as a matter of fact, though this fact was unknown to Pat,\r\nthe Falls are sufficiently dangerous to cause the loss of one life per\r\nyear on an average, besides many accidents which do not result in an\r\nactual loss of life; and it was this knowledge of the dangers attendant\r\nupon boating in these waters which had led to Mr. Darner’s prohibition.\r\n\r\nThus Pat went innocently and confidently to work, and obtained a boat;\r\nand Phil entered with the utmost eagerness into Pat’s plan. Bart’s\r\nstrong objections and earnest warnings had, however, produced sufficient\r\neffect upon them to make them anxious to keep their plan a secret from\r\nhim, and to carry it into execution at some time when he might not be\r\nwith them. But this was not very easy, for Bart was always with one or\r\nboth of them; and so, even after they had found a boat, it still seemed\r\nas difficult as ever to make use of it.\r\n\r\nAt length an event occurred which gave them the long desired opportunity\r\nof making use of the boat in a voyage to the islands.\r\n\r\nThis event was the receipt by Bart of a letter from Bruce Rawdon. It was\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n“Dear old Bart: How are you, and how have you been enjoying yourself?\r\nAre you aware that four weeks have passed, and that our holidays will\r\nsoon be over? I’ve got several things to say, and others to propose, and\r\ntherefore I take my pen in hand on the present occasion.\r\n\r\n“First of all, Tom is with us, and has been all along. A week after we\r\ngot home, he received a letter from his father, who told him that he was\r\ngoing to England with his mother, and that he might stay with us, and go\r\nback to school with us. Well, Tom was a little disappointed, but not\r\nso very much, after all. So he’s been here ever since. The next thing I\r\nhave to tell you is, the arrival here of a mutual friend and benefactor.\r\nYou see it happened this way: The other day I was down on one of the\r\nwharves, when I was struck by a familiar-looking craft, and on going\r\nnearer it became still more familiar. So I jumped on board in a state\r\nof high excitement, and put my head into the opening of a very familiar\r\ncabin, when suddenly it encountered another head that was putting itself\r\nout. And who do you think it was? I won’t keep you in suspense. It was\r\nCaptain Corbet! Yes, it was himself, as meek, as mild, as paternal, and\r\nas venerable as ever. He came here after oats. With him is Mr. Wade,\r\nwhose ‘ole ’oman’s name’ he still insists is Gipson, and he also\r\nasserts that we won’t find many of that name in this country.\r\n\r\n“Well, now I come to the point of my letter. We have persuaded the\r\nvenerable Corbet to give up oats for the present and charter his ship\r\nto us. We have organized a campaign around the Bay de Chaleur. We are\r\ngoing to operate by sea and land. Now, what do you say to it? Will you\r\ncome? Is Phil with you, and Pat? Have you got Solomon? What do you say?\r\nCan you resist? Can you keep away when you hear that the Antelope is\r\nonce more upon the waters, and that the flag of the B. O. W. C. is again\r\nfloating from her masthead? Resist? You know you can’t.\r\n\r\n“And so I merely remark that we shall be at Shippegan, on the Bay de\r\nChaleur, on the 15th of August. This gives you two or three weeks to\r\nreach us. We shall expect you. Bring Phil. Bring Pat. Bring Solomon.\r\nWithout the glow of his beloved countenance shining upon us as it beams\r\nover the cooking-stove, no expedition is worth having.\r\n\r\n“We start in a few days. You need not answer, as there will not be time\r\nto get your letter. We all count upon meeting you at Shippegan on August\r\n15.\r\n\r\n“The venerable Corbet sends his blessing.\r\n\r\n“Yours in B. O. W. C.\r\n\r\n“Bruce Rawdon.”\r\n\r\nThis letter created the wildest outburst of joy that is possible to the\r\neffervescing spirits of enthusiastic boys. It came at the very time when\r\nthe holidays were beginning to grow a little dull; when all its first\r\npleasures had been exhausted, and no new ones remained. Coming thus, it\r\nbrought the prospect of new excitement, and met with but one response.\r\nBart eagerly appealed to his father, and received his permission to meet\r\nhis friends. Then followed long discussions as to their journey to the\r\nBay de Chaleur; and first and most important among the preliminaries\r\nof their journey was the necessity of preparing Solomon for what was\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\nSolomon!\r\n\r\nBut where was Solomon?\r\n\r\nShortly after their arrival, he had taken his departure, and had not\r\nbeen seen since. Bart, however, knew where he had gone, and supposed\r\nthat he might be there yet; so he proposed that they should all drive\r\noff in search of Solomon early on the following day.\r\n\r\nThere soon arose a difficulty, however, which interfered with this. The\r\nplace was fifteen miles away, and Mr. Damer would not trust the horse to\r\nBart alone. If the servant drove, there would not be room for them\r\nall, and so one, at least, would have to stay behind. Pat and Phil each\r\noffered to stay; and as it would be lonely for only one to remain, it\r\nwas finally decided that both should stay, while Bart went off alone to\r\nsearch after the Grand Panjandrum.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement was the very thing that was most satisfactory to Phil\r\nand Pat; and thus chance threw into their way the very opportunity for\r\nwhich they had been waiting so eagerly and impatiently.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning Bart started, while Phil and Pat waited a\r\nlittle while, in order to have a convenient time for setting forth\r\nupon their own enterprise. The sky was clear, and the sun was bright\r\noverhead; but half way down the harbor there were heavy fog clouds,\r\nwhich increased until all the distance was concealed from view. But as\r\nthese fogs belonged to the bay, and did not affect the land, they had no\r\nanxiety about their excursion, since it was to take place on the river.\r\n\r\nThey waited leisurely about the house for an hour after breakfast, and\r\nat length left without saying anything to anybody, and went at once to\r\nthe Falls. As they came in sight of the river, they looked with eager\r\neyes over its surface to see whether the time was a suitable one for\r\ntheir enterprise. Their first glance was highly satisfactory. As far as\r\nthey could judge, it seemed the very best time that there could be to\r\nmake the attempt. The water was quite smooth, and the stream was moving\r\nalong rather slowly. Upon reaching the suspension bridge, they stood\r\nstill and looked down. As they stood there, they saw several wood boats\r\napproaching them from the upper part of the river. They came along\r\nslowly, and with as little motion of any kind as though they were in the\r\nplacid waters farther up. The two boys watched them as they passed under\r\nthe bridge, and then followed them with their eyes as they half sailed,\r\nhalf drifted, onward to the harbor.\r\n\r\nThis sight greatly encouraged them, and there seemed now not the\r\nslightest doubt of the perfect feasibility of their enterprise. Without\r\nany further delay, therefore, they at once set out for the place where\r\nthe boat was kept that Pat had engaged.\r\n\r\nThe Falls are about a quarter of a mile above the suspension bridge.\r\nAt this place, as has been said, the river contracts, and is hemmed in\r\nbe-between the projecting precipice of a rocky promontory on one side,\r\nand a small, shaggy, wooded island on the other. Between these it pours\r\nits flood, which alternates between the swift influx of the sea-water at\r\nhigh tide, and the Swift, thunderous outpour of low tide, when the river\r\nflings itself in wrath and foam down a declivity of rocks that form its\r\nbed. Above this place there is a wide expanse, and on the upper side of\r\nthe promontory is a cove which affords an excellent shelter for boats,\r\nrafts, and schooners. It was in this cove that their boat was kept, and\r\ntowards this they now directed their steps as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the place, they found the boat afloat, with its oars inside,\r\nand fastened by the painter to the wharf. Here they stopped for a short\r\ntime, and again looked forth over the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nImmediately in front it was as smooth as a millpond, and farther out it\r\nappeared to be quite as calm. The two islands to which they wished to\r\ngo were out there, full before them, on the other side of the river, yet\r\nnot so far away but that they could be reached by a moderate effort.\r\nA brief survey satisfied both of them; and without waiting any longer,\r\nthey cast off’ the line, and rowed away towards the islands.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour’s vigorous pulling brought them well out of the\r\ncove, and soon they reached the channel of the river. Here the water was\r\nstill smooth; but they noticed that the current was much stronger than\r\nthey had expected to find it. After all, however, there was as yet no\r\nvery great force in it; and so they pulled on. But the current made some\r\nchange in their plans; for, whereas they had at first intended to go to\r\nthe upper island, they now found the sweep of the tide dragging them so\r\nfar out of their course, that they decided to land upon the lower one.\r\n\r\nThis one lay nearest now. They were between the two, and the rocky shore\r\nof the island was close by. It was the part of the island which lay\r\nfarthest up stream. They thought it best to visit this one first, then\r\nthe other, after which they could return to the shore, or continue their\r\nexplorations in other directions, as the fancy might seize them.\r\n\r\nWith these intentions, they turned the boat’s head towards the island,\r\nand in a short time stepped out upon the rocky beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_The Island in the Falls.--A Discovery of a startling Kind.--The sullen\r\nBoar.--A mad Risk.--The Struggle for Life.--On the Verge of Ruin.--A\r\nlast Effort.--Over the Falls.--Ingulfed and drawn down by the\r\nVortex.--Where is Pat!_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE boys secured their boat to the rocks, and then clambered up the\r\nbank to the top of the island. Arriving there, they found but little to\r\nbe seen. The island was of very small dimensions, and the thick woods\r\nthat covered it made it impossible to gain any view of the whole scene\r\naround. They crossed to the lower side, and came back; after which they\r\nsat down on the edge of the bank, just above the boat, and looked out.\r\nThey could see up the river from here--the wide cove, the rocky shores,\r\nthe saw-mills, the rafts, the scows, the tug boats, the wood boats,\r\nand the river steamers. Now that they were on the island, there was\r\ncertainly not much to reward them, except this view; and even this was\r\nnot equal to that which might be had from the suspension bridge. But,\r\nthen, they were not altogether destitute of a reward. The island was\r\nsmall and insignificant; but, then, it was an island, and that was\r\nsomething. Besides, their position here meant that they had achieved\r\ntheir enterprise; and the consciousness of success was of itself a\r\nsufficient reward.\r\n\r\n“I wonder,” said Phil, “why no more vessels go through the Falls--”\r\n\r\n“Through the Falls, is it?” said Pat. “O, sure it’s just because they\r\ndon’t want to; an that’s all, so it is.”\r\n\r\nAfter some more conversation, they began to grow tired of the island;\r\nand since they had exhausted all the pleasure that a landing upon it,\r\ncombined with the consciousness of success, could afford, there remained\r\nnothing more to do but to complete their enterprise by effecting a\r\nlanding upon the other island also.\r\n\r\nThis one lay farther up the stream; and as they launched their boat and\r\nrowed towards it, they became at once sensible of a great increase in\r\nthe difficulty of their task. With their utmost efforts their progress\r\nwas very slow, and it took far longer to reach it than it had taken\r\nto come from the shore to the first island. At length, however, they\r\nreached it, and secured the boat.\r\n\r\n“Ye see,” said Pat, who always was ready to account for everything,--“ye\r\nsee we’ve had the tide dead agin us this time. Whin we crossed the river\r\nit was on’y on one side. Whin we go back, it’ll be all fair and aisy,\r\nfor we’ll have it on one side agin; and that’s how it is.”\r\n\r\nThey now began to explore this second island. It was larger than the\r\nother, but did not seem so large. As it was free from woods, its small\r\nextent was perceptible at a glance, which was not the case with the\r\nother. The absence of woods made it also even less interesting. But the\r\nboys were not at all exacting; and as there was nothing in particular\r\nto see on the island, they naturally turned their eyes to the scene that\r\nlay beyond. This scene was now very extensive. They could look around in\r\nevery direction, and enjoy an unobstructed view. Up the river it was\r\nthe same as it had been before--the same assemblage of rocky hills, and\r\nschooners, and steamers, and rafts; but down the river a grander view\r\nunfolded itself before their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe river there ran on till it seemed terminated by a wall of rocks, at\r\nthe foot of which a steam saw-mill was clattering and howling. On each\r\nside of the water arose perpendicular cliffs, and between these was\r\nthe suspension bridge, whose frail pathway was sustained by cables that\r\npassed over granite towers at the edge of the precipice; and overhung a\r\ntremendous gulf of treacherous waters.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Phil put his hand on Pat’s shoulder. Pat turned, and saw him\r\nlooking anxiously out over the water and pointing.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” asked Pat.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what makes it so white over there,” said Phil, in an anxious\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nHe was pointing to the water between the island and the promontory.\r\nHere the surface was agitated, and foam was emerging and floating on\r\nin ever-increasing masses, while a deep, dull roar began to be slowly\r\nperceptible to their ears.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” repeated Pat, after looking for a little while in silence\r\nat the place where Phil had pointed. “What is it?” he repeated, after\r\na little hesitation. Then his hesitation vanished, and in his usual\r\nconfident way, he proceeded to account for the foam.\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s the foam,” said he, “an that’s what it is.”\r\n\r\n“But there wasn’t any foam a little while ago,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“Deed, thin, an I wor jist thinkin that same,” said Pat, in a candid\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nThe boys stood now for a little while in silence. The low, dull roar\r\nincreased as they listened, and excited very singular feelings in the\r\nminds of both.\r\n\r\n“The tide is certainly stronger,” said Phil--“a good deal stronger. I\r\nwonder if--if--it’s too strong for us.”\r\n\r\n“Niver a bit,” said Pat, shaking off his uneasiness. “Sure an we’ll\r\nhave no throuble. We’re jist a good bit above the Falls--so we are--an\r\nthere’s no danger--not the laist in life.”\r\n\r\nAgain they stopped, and looked, and listened.\r\n\r\nAnd now the foam had increased, the dull roar was perceptibly louder,\r\nand its deep cadence reverberated in their inmost hearts, exciting dark\r\napprehensions.\r\n\r\n“Deed an I’ll jist tell ye what it is,” cried Pat, suddenly. “It’s no use\r\nstandin here all day; we must hurry out of this.”\r\n\r\n“But can we now?” asked Phil, uneasily.\r\n\r\n“Sure an why not?”\r\n\r\n“The tide--it’s so strong.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an that’s nothin,” said Pat. “All we’ve got to do is to head the\r\nboat up strame, half up an half across, an we’ll slide over that way in\r\nspite of the tide, so we will.”\r\n\r\nPat’s confident tone reassured Phil, and as Pat set off quickly to\r\nthe boat, he followed without a word of further objection. Under the\r\nimpression that there was now not a moment’s time to lose, they pushed\r\nthe boat off; and seizing the oars, they began pulling with all their\r\nstrength, Pat taking the stroke oar, and striving to head her in that\r\nmysterious direction which he had described a short time ago. For a few\r\nminutes they exerted all their strength; and both boys, as they pulled,\r\nkept turning their heads, so as to see the shore, which they wished to\r\ngain. Those few minutes served to put a considerable distance between\r\nthem and the island which they had left. But the interval was not\r\nexactly the kind which they wished to see between them and it. It was\r\nevident that their progress forward was not very great, but that at the\r\nsame time their progress down the stream was fearfully rapid. And that\r\nstream was setting full towards the Falls.\r\n\r\nPhil noticed this first, and his cry aroused Pat, who was still too much\r\ninterested in watching his destination to regard his actual situation.\r\nBut that situation, as the two boys looked around upon it, was\r\ncalculated to administer a shock to the strongest nerves, and quicken\r\nthe action of the stoutest heart.\r\n\r\nThe river current was running down at such a rate of speed that their\r\nefforts to counteract it while crossing were quite unavailing. Its force\r\nhad already dragged them down stream about half way between the two\r\nislands, while the actual progress which they had made towards their\r\ndestination was small. Their downward drift had brought them nearer to\r\nthe Falls, and as they took their hasty look around, they were aware\r\nagain of that low, sullen roar which they had heard on the island; but\r\nnow that roar was deeper and nearer, and the low, droning sound of the\r\nagitated waters struck more menacingly upon their ears.\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was still one chance, and one only. That was to\r\nhead the boat back for the island which they had just left. Had they\r\ndone so, and rowed for their lives, there was a possibility of emerging\r\nyet from the clutch of that hungry current, which grew more and more\r\ntenacious as they advanced, and from which escape was only possible by\r\na retreat. But at that moment Pat did not fully realize the danger that\r\nimpended. He was quite cool, and the mistake that he made arose from an\r\nerror in judgment, rather than from anything like panic. He had only\r\nthe idea of resisting the current, and was unable as yet to give up\r\nhis purpose of returning to the boat’s wharf. So he headed the boat up\r\nstream in such a way that their own force should be brought as much as\r\npossible against the current, and yet secure to it a slight advance.\r\n\r\nThey now pulled, as before, in silence, using all their strength. The\r\nhead of the boat was almost up stream, and as they pulled they could see\r\nall that could be seen of the danger below them. For about five minutes\r\nthey thus struggled, and at the end of that time there began to force\r\nitself into the minds of both of them the dread conviction that the\r\nstrength of the current was too great for their efforts. Pat saw this\r\nfirst, and, seeing this, made a final relinquishment of his efforts to\r\ncross, and put the boat’s head straight up stream, so as to make all\r\ntheir efforts tell against the tide itself. But by that time they had\r\nbrought themselves to where the tide was strongest, and that tide was\r\ngrowing stronger and stronger every minute. This they both saw and felt;\r\nand they knew enough of the nature of the Falls to understand now the\r\nmistake that they had made. For they had crossed to the islands when the\r\ntide was falling, and, in their attempt to return, had been caught by a\r\ntide that had been increasing in force ever since they had last crossed\r\nit, and was still increasing and directing all its might down towards\r\nthe Falls.\r\n\r\nTheir efforts to resist the tide were overpowered. The river was\r\ngaining; their strength was failing. One last, faint hope remained--to\r\nturn the boat back, to pull towards the islands; it might yet be\r\npossible by strenuous effort to drag the boat forth from the clutch\r\nof the mighty waters. The lower island was as yet below them, on their\r\nleft; if they could only bring the boat out of the middle of the stream,\r\nthey might reach it.\r\n\r\nFor the last time, then, Pat changed the direction of the boat, turning\r\nit but slightly, however, just enough to aim at the upper island. Then\r\nagain, as before, they put forth their last remaining energies. With\r\nfeverish anxiety they fixed their eyes upon one or two objects on the\r\nland, to watch whether the boat was losing or gaining. That it was still\r\nbeing drawn down by the tide was at once certain; but they yet had a\r\nhope that their advance towards the islands might serve to bring them\r\nthere before it was too late. And now they had fairly reached the crisis\r\nof this tremendous struggle. Rousing up the very last of their exhausted\r\nstrength, they exerted themselves with the convulsive energies of\r\ndespair, working in silence, with eyes fixed on the shore.\r\n\r\nIn vain!\r\n\r\nThey saw themselves drawn down in a line with the lower island, and\r\nthere, tree by tree, and rock by rock, they saw that island slipping\r\npast them; while the distance between them and it had been lessened so\r\nslightly that it afforded no prospect whatever of their being able to\r\nattain it. At length the last vestige of hope died out. The howling,\r\nwrathful vortex was just before them, and now the islands were\r\nforgotten, and all their efforts were directed towards saving themselves\r\nas long as possible from that fate which they felt was inevitable.\r\n\r\nOf the two, Pat was the least affected. Phil was pale, and sat with his\r\neyes glaring at the flood, straining himself at the oars with all his\r\nstrength, his brows contracted, his lips parted, his breath coming and\r\ngoing in quick, short gasps. As for Pat, the ruddy color of his honest\r\nbut freckled Irish face remained unchanged; and though he was working\r\nwith all his might, he as yet showed no signs of any very extreme\r\nexhaustion; for his muscles were harder, and his frame more inured to\r\nlabor, than the slender limbs and lighter frame of his companion. Nor\r\ndid he gasp or sob, nor were his brows contracted, nor was there any\r\nother expression on his face than that same jovial, healthy, and withal\r\nrather impudent self-confidence which it usually wore.\r\n\r\nYet, if anything could have reduced Pat to despair it was the sight that\r\nnow appeared immediately before him.\r\n\r\nThe boat had been dragged for some distance out of the middle of the\r\nstream, and was nearer the island than it had been, though still out of\r\nreach. The tide was fearfully strong. At every desperate pull the boat\r\nwould stand still; but between the strokes the tide would bear it down.\r\nThus their efforts only served now to stop the boat for a few moments at\r\nevery stroke, without in any way ennabling them to elude their fate.\r\n\r\nThe Falls were close at hand--just in front.\r\n\r\nThese Falls were not, however, a thunderous cataract, though at the\r\nlowest stage of the tide, their furious surges, as they sweep over\r\nthe rock-strewn descent of the river bed, would be, perhaps, even more\r\ndangerous than a cataract itself. But now they were not at their most\r\nfurious stage. Still, as the boys gazed there, they saw enough to appall\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAll across was a white line of foam. Immediately in front, the water\r\nseemed to come in contact with some hidden reef, for it lifted itself up\r\nin a heap, and, rounding over, tumbled in thunder on the other side.\r\nIt was towards this that they were drifting. This was sufficiently\r\nformidable, but where the foam tossed and the boiling waters seethed in\r\na long flood of white, it seemed equally so; and thus even if Pat had\r\nbeen inclined to make a choice of some particular place to direct\r\nthe boat, he would not have been able to select one, since all places\r\nappeared equally repellent. The fact was, however, Pat had no such\r\nideas, but was thinking of some other way of encountering the coming\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nThere, then, full before them, was the long line of boiling breakers;\r\nthere was that upheaving mass of water rounding itself over the sunken\r\nledge. The hiss of the foam was in their ears, while beneath it was the\r\ngloomy menace of the roar of many waters.\r\n\r\n“Phil,” cried Pat, “can you swim?”\r\n\r\n“A little,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“It’s our last chance. Will ye do what I tell ye?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Take off yer coat, howld on to yer oar, and jump whin I give the word.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Phil; “stop rowing? Why, we’ll be lost--”\r\n\r\n“Lost, is it? We’re sure to be that--row--or no row--so do as I\r\nsay--will ye?”\r\n\r\nPhil was silent for a moment, and still tugged at his oar, for neither\r\nof them had stopped during this conversation. In that moment of\r\nextremest peril there was no time to be taken up in deliberating. He had\r\neither to consent to Pat’s proposition, or refuse, and that at once.\r\n\r\n“The boat’ll upset,” cried Pat, “sure. You jump out wid me whin I give\r\nthe word. But ye’ll have to take off yer coat first. Yer bound to get a\r\nduckin, ony way, an ye’d better do as I say.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll do it,” cried Phil, suddenly and decidedly.\r\n\r\n“Aff wid yer coat, thin,” cried Pat.\r\n\r\nBoth boys flung down their oars, and whipped off their coats in an\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nThe boat was dragged now, without any further resistance, straight\r\ntowards the Falls.\r\n\r\n“Grab howld of yer oar,” cried Pat, quickly. “Stand up, an’ jump whin\r\nI give the word--ony mind, whin ye do jump, jump for’ard as fur as ye\r\ncan.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Phil, quietly.\r\n\r\nThe two boys now stood up, each grasping an oar, and watching the water\r\nbefore them. The boat drifted down--nearer and nearer! Phil’s heart\r\nthrobbed fast in the suspense of that dread moment, but Pat stood cool,\r\ncollected, with his sharp, eager glance watching for the right time to\r\njump.\r\n\r\nAnd now that mighty mass of water, that lifted itself up in a heap, as\r\nit rose and rounded itself over the sunken ledge, grasped the boat, and\r\nraised it on high in its tremendous embrace, and impelled it forward.\r\nFor a moment the boat seemed to linger there hesitating. Then it\r\ntrembled in every fibre. Then it slowly turned round, till its broad\r\nside was presented to the waters below. Then one side was slowly drawn\r\ndown under the water, while the other side rose up. Behind it a wall of\r\nwater rushed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Pat gave a loud yell--\r\n\r\n“Jump!”\r\n\r\nPhil was already standing with the oar poised in one hand, and the other\r\nhand outstretched, waiting for Pat’s word. Every nerve, every sinew, was\r\non the alert, and before the whole word was fairly spoken, and before\r\nPat himself had sprung, Phil leaped forward. His feet touched the\r\nwater first, He went down. A tremendous grasp seemed to seize upon him,\r\ndragging him downward, and ever downward. He gave himself up for lost.\r\nIn the whirl of his senses, he seemed sinking into fathomless abysses,\r\nand in his ears there were the howling and the abhorrent uproar, and the\r\ndeafening thunder-peal of a thousand cataracts. Then, in the midst of\r\nall this, another grasp clutched him, and dragged him swiftly forward,\r\nand whirled him round and round. Then he seemed to be thrown upward\r\nby the resistless upheaval of some mighty mass beneath him, and then\r\nsuddenly he shot forth, out of the darkness and the uproar of the\r\ningulfing waters, into the upper air and the glad light of day.\r\n\r\nClutching his oar, which he had held all this time with the grasp of a\r\ndrowning man, he drew a long breath, and looked all around. Above\r\nhim was the blue sky; farther on, across the sky, hung the suspension\r\nbridge; behind him was the howl of the Charybdis that he had just\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nWhere was Pat?\r\n\r\nAs he thought of this, an involuntary shudder passed through him. He\r\nhimself had escaped, and he now felt comparatively safe, for the oar was\r\nof immense assistance, and with the help of this it needed only a slight\r\neffort to keep his head above water. As to progress in any direction,\r\nthe water was settling that question for him; for the mighty, resistless\r\ntide held him in its embrace, and was bearing him onward helplessly.\r\nThere was no place to which he might look for escape, and no one to\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nBut where was Pat?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n_Bart off on an Expedition.--The Search after Solomon.--The aged\r\nToiler.--The Flaming Fury.--The brandished Broomstick.--Collapse of\r\nSolomon.--Extinction of the Flaming Fury.--Solomon vanishes.--Terrible\r\nTidings.--An anxious Search.--Despair._\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANWHILE Bart had started off, as we have seen, on his expedition\r\nafter old Solomon. The place in which he proposed to seek after him\r\nwas distinguished by the euphonious and historical name of Loch Lomond,\r\nwhich name originated from the existence of a small but very pretty lake\r\nin that locality, which was in the neighborhood of a hill. Now, this\r\nlake and this hill bore a fanciful resemblance to the famous Scottish\r\nlake and hill, and the names were applied to these by some enthusiastic\r\nScotchman. The lake was one of a chain, all of which were small and\r\nrather pretty, and the whole region round about went by the name that\r\nproperly belonged to the lake.\r\n\r\nTwo or three miles away from this lake there was what is called a\r\n“colored settlement,” which, of course, means a settlement inhabited by\r\npeople of color. This was also called the “black settlement,” and also\r\nthe “nigger settlement.” Solomon had informed Bart that he intended\r\nvisiting this place, and Bart thought of this as the only place where he\r\ncould be heard of.\r\n\r\nThe colored settlement was founded by some slaves, brought away from\r\nthe Southern States by the British during the war of 1812. They had\r\nbeen presented with land here, and had been told to chop down the trees,\r\nclear the land, and become farmers. The settlement had not been a very\r\ngreat success, however, and it was generally admitted that the genius of\r\nthese people did not lie in colonizing new countries.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful morning, and though Bart saw high fog banks piled up\r\nto the skies in the harbor and in the bay, yet he soon left behind\r\nhim all thought of this, and entered the country. The scenery was\r\nattractive, the air was clear and exhilarating, the horse was fast, and\r\neverything conspired to fill him with joyous feeling. His mind reverted\r\nto Bruce’s letter, and he passed most of his time during the drive in\r\nspeculating about the coming excursion, and in rejoicing over the happy\r\naccident that had taken Captain Corbet to Prince Edward Island, and\r\nbrought him within sight of Bruce before he had engaged about the oats.\r\nAmid such pleasant thoughts as these his mind busied itself, and at\r\nlength he reached the colored settlement.\r\n\r\nHe stopped at a rude log hut, which had a roof of poles and mud, from\r\nwhich a flour barrel projected, and served as a chimney. Here some\r\nsqualid children were playing on the turf, and an elderly colored lady\r\nwas engaged in washing. Her Bart accosted with a polite inquiry about\r\nSolomon.\r\n\r\n“Solomon!” said she. “Wha dat ar? What? dat ar ole man? Mrs. Franklin’s\r\nole man?”\r\n\r\nBart didn’t know anything about Mrs. Franklin, but he gave a description\r\nof Solomon, which was sufficiently accurate for this lady to recognize\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Dem’s um,” she said, in a positive tone. “Wal--dat ar ole man’s libben\r\nat Mrs. Franklin’s--”\r\n\r\n“And where is Mrs. Franklin’s?”\r\n\r\n“Jes you go ahead till you come to de meetin’ house, an it’s de sebent\r\nhouse after you get to de meetin-house.”\r\n\r\nBart drove on, and in due process of time reached the meeting-house, and\r\nthen began to count the houses. He found a little difficulty about this,\r\nas he could hardly distinguish between what might be a house and what\r\nmight also be a barn, and was stopping at a place in the road opposite\r\na hut like the one at which he had first stopped, when his attention\r\nwas arrested by the sight of a man in the field on the other side of the\r\nway. The man’s back was turned towards him, and he was toiling with all\r\nhis might over a stone and a crowbar, occasionally straightening himself\r\nup and rubbing his back, and uttering groans which reached Bart’s ears\r\neven at that distance, and smote upon his heart.\r\n\r\nThat aged figure,--aged it was,--could that indeed be Solomon? and was\r\nthis the way he enjoyed himself while on a visit to his friends? With a\r\ncrowbar, prying up granite boulders? What a thought!\r\n\r\nIn a moment Bart was out of the wagon, and was running over the fields\r\ntowards the old man. He came up close just as the old man was rubbing\r\nhis back. He caught him by the arm. The old man gave a wild leap, and\r\nturned round with an expression of awful fear.\r\n\r\nBut the object of his fear resolved itself into the pleasant face of\r\nBart, and all the terror fled, and a smile of joy illumed the venerable,\r\nyet dusky face. Tears started to his eyes, and, reaching out both\r\nhands, he dropped the crowbar; then, coming forward with a low moan of\r\nhappiness, he exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“You! Mas’r Bart. You, Mas’r Bart--you--you--Mas’r Bart--”\r\n\r\nYes, it was Solomon.\r\n\r\nFull of wonder and pity, Bart seized the hands of his old friend, and\r\nbegan asking him a thousand questions. What was he doing here? What did\r\nhe mean by keeping away? And then, without waiting for an answer, he\r\nwent on to tell about Bruce’s letter, and their proposed expedition,\r\nand the necessity which there was for him to accompany them. Finally he\r\nurged him to get ready as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nTo all this Solomon listened in silence, without saying a word. He stood\r\nwith his hands clasped together, with his eyes fixed at times on Bart,\r\nand at times half closed, while his lips kept muttering low, inaudible\r\nwords. At length, however, his face and manner underwent a change. He\r\nstarted back, his eyes were fixed on something in the distance, and that\r\nsame expression of terror came over his face which Bart had seen upon it\r\nwhen he first accosted him.\r\n\r\nAt this Bart turned instinctively to see what it was that inspired such\r\nterror in the mind of Solomon.\r\n\r\nHe saw a colored lady--tall, gaunt, with a turban on her brow of flaming\r\nred, with a look of fury on her face, and a broom in her hand, which she\r\nwas brandishing wildly. She came with great strides at a run, and was\r\nevidently coming towards them. Bart’s first idea was, that she might be\r\na mad woman, and he had a vague impulse to run; but the next instant his\r\nmind connected this woman with Solomon, and suggested her as the cause\r\nof his fear. As for Solomon, he was now quite beside himself with\r\nterror. His hands fell nerveless by his sides, his jaw dropped, his head\r\nshook as with a palsy, his knees knocked together, he seemed scarce able\r\nto stand erect, and could not utter one single word; all the while his\r\neyes were fixed on the advancing Fury with the flaming turban, and his\r\nlook was the look of one who expected instant annihilation.\r\n\r\nThe Fury of the flaming turban drew nearer. Her course showed that she\r\nhad emerged from the house on the opposite side of the road. As she\r\nrushed on, and as she brandished her broom, she howled out the most\r\nterrible threats against somebody, which somebody Bart now supposed must\r\nbe Solomon, and at once, full of pity, determined to defend the old\r\nman from her fury. He therefore stood in front of Solomon, and was just\r\nabout to call to his servant to come and help him, when the idea struck\r\nhim that the Flaming Fury seemed strangely familiar to him; and as she\r\ncame yet nearer, he recognized her perfectly. To his utter bewilderment\r\nand unbounded amazement, the Flaming Fury turned out to be no other\r\nthan one who, for the last few years, had been quite a visitor at his\r\nfather’s kitchen, and a dependant on his father’s bounty. “Black Betsy”\r\n was the name by which she was known. A silvery voice, a truly humble and\r\ngrateful mind, a meek and quiet spirit, a winning demeanor, a smile that\r\nalways charmed every one upon whom it beamed,--such was the Black Betsy\r\nthat was known and loved in the Damer kitchen. But what was this? What\r\nhad happened?\r\n\r\nThis Black Betsy? This Virago, this Terror, this Flaming Fury? This!\r\nImpossible. Yet there was the astounding fact. There was only one\r\nexplanation. Black Betsy was mad!\r\n\r\nNo, Bart, she was not mad; she was only drunk;--mad drunk, if you like,\r\nbut not what is generally called mad.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, mad drunk, the Flaming Fury came bounding up, howling and\r\nbrandishing her broom. The moment that he recognized her, Bart felt not\r\nthe slightest fear of her. He stood in front of Solomon. He looked at\r\nher fixedly, and raised his hand with a quiet frown.\r\n\r\nIt is just possible that, if Bart had been a stranger, the Flaming Fury\r\nwould have swept him away with her broom, as she would have swept\r\na straw. But seeing him, and recognizing him, produced an effect\r\ninstantaneous and most astonishing. She stopped, still staring at him.\r\nThe broom for a few moments remained poised in her hands, and then\r\nslowly sank towards the ground; while, at the same time, the hard\r\nferocity of her face died out utterly, and was succeeded by a smile so\r\ngentle, so amiable, and so motherly, that Bart looked at her in fresh\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n“Why, ef it ain’t de dear chicken! Ef it ain’t de dear little Mas’r\r\nBart, his bressed sef. De sakes, now!”\r\n\r\nThis exclamation was uttered in the softest, and most silvery, and\r\nmost winning of those tones which Bart had always associated with Black\r\nBetsy. This additional proof of the identity of this amiable being with\r\nthe Flaming Fury only increased his wonder.\r\n\r\n“An how is dat ar bressed angel, your mudder, Mas’r Bart? Clar ef dese\r\nyer ole eyes ain’t farly achin to see her agin.”\r\n\r\n“She’s very well, thanks,” said Bart, slowly.\r\n\r\n“Dat’s good; dat’s lubly. Clar ef it don’t go clean to my ole heart! An\r\nso you dribe out to see de ole man! Wal, I allus sez, dat ar Mas’r Bart,\r\nI ses, ef he ain’t de ’stror’nest, ’fecsh’nest chicken! All heart,\r\nI sez, he is; all clar lub--no mistake. An what is dis life wurf widout\r\nlub? Why, it’s notin but de soundin brasses an templin simplum. Clar ef\r\nit ain’t!”\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation had been going on, Solomon had regained\r\nconsciousness; and seeing the change that had come over the woman, and\r\nthat the Flaming Fury had subsided into the gentlest of beings, he began\r\nto gather together his scattered senses. Bart’s back was turned to him,\r\nand so he did not see him. But Solomon did not care for that. His one\r\nidea now was to save himself for the time, at least.\r\n\r\nSo, first of all, he edged away a little, very slowly and very\r\ncautiously. No notice was taken of this, and he ventured to retreat\r\nstill farther. Still Black Betsy went on talking in her silvery voice,\r\nand with her winning smile. So Solomon retreated still farther. Black\r\nBetsy saw all this movement, and once she raised the broom and held it\r\nin the air. But her face was wreathed with smiles, and her soft, gentle\r\naccents flowed on in a mellifluous strain; and so it was, that the\r\nupraised broom, instead of calling Solomon back, only hastened his\r\nretreat. He thereupon turned abruptly, and making his way as rapidly as\r\npossible to the nearest woods, he soon disappeared.\r\n\r\nBlack Betsy still went on, mellifluous and voluble. The warmth of her\r\nnature seemed boundless. Tears stood in her eyes as she told Bart how\r\nshe loved his mother. Finally she stopped with a sob, overcome with\r\nemotion, as she related the kindness she had received from his father,\r\nand began to cry.\r\n\r\nAt this Bart, who had been trying in vain to understand her, finally\r\ngave it up, and thought of Solomon. He turned around to speak to him.\r\n\r\nTo his amazement Solomon was not there.\r\n\r\nAnd now this completed his bewilderment. He drew a long breath, and gave\r\nup altogether every effort to understand anything at all.\r\n\r\n“Why, where has Solomon gone?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Berryin,” said Black Betsy, gently--“berryin. De ole man dreadful fond\r\no’ berries.”\r\n\r\n“Berries? Well, that’s odd. Why, I want to see him.”\r\n\r\n“He tink he gib you pleasant ’prise--go pick berries for de dear\r\nchicken,” said Black Betsy, in a tender voice.\r\n\r\n“But I want him,” said Bart. “I want him now. Where did he go?”\r\n\r\n“Don-no, Mas’r Bart--no mor’n a chile. You call out real loud,--you got\r\nto call loud fore dat ar ole man’ll har you. He’s got dreadful deaf an\r\nhard o’ hearin o’ late--dese times.”\r\n\r\nBart now shouted over and over again, but there was no response. He\r\nasked his servant if he had noticed Solomon. The servant had noticed\r\nhim, and told him about the retreat to the woods. Bart did not know what\r\nto make of it all. The apparition of the Flaming Fury had gradually lost\r\nits force, and he thought only of the gentle, silvery voice of Black\r\nBetsy. The retreat of Solomon, therefore, did not seem to arise from\r\nfear of so gentle a being, but from something else--and what could that\r\nbe?\r\n\r\n“De ole man tinks you gwine to spen de day,” said Black Betsy. “He gone\r\nolf to dig sassy-prilla to make beer. You wait and he come back soon.”\r\n\r\nSo Bart waited a little while, hoping that Solomon would return.\r\n\r\nBut Solomon did not return.\r\n\r\nBlack Betsy entertained him with remarks in her usual strains, chiefly\r\nof an affectionate and endearing character; but Bart was so disappointed\r\nthat he paid but little attention to her. He had come out to get\r\nSolomon’s consent to go with him, and had not been able to do so. What\r\nwas the reason? Could it be possible that Solomon did not want to go,\r\nbut did not like to refuse, and so had taken this way of getting out of\r\nthe difficulty? It seemed very much like it.\r\n\r\nBart waited an hour or so, and then drove away to an inn on the borders\r\nof the lake. Here he dined. Then he drove back again to see Solomon.\r\nTo his deep disappointment he learned that Solomon had not made his\r\nappearance since. He therefore left a message to the effect that he\r\nwould drive out again on the following day, or, if it was stormy, on\r\nthe first fine day. This was all he could do; and so, mastering his\r\ndisappointment as well as he could, he drove home again.\r\n\r\nIt was evening when he reached home. Here a fresh surprise awaited him;\r\nfor on asking after Phil and Pat, he learned that they left the house\r\nafter breakfast, and had not been seen since. He wondered at this, as he\r\ncould not imagine what would take them away, particularly on an occasion\r\nlike this, when they ought to be naturally anxious to learn the result\r\nof so important a thing as his search after Solomon. He concluded,\r\nhowever, that they had gone off on some long walk, or out in the harbor\r\nin a boat, and had been detained.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, as he was wandering about, the servant who had driven him\r\nto Loch Lomond met him, and told him that there was a report of some\r\naccident that had occurred at the Falls that morning.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Bart’s most anxious excitement was aroused, and he asked\r\nabout the accident. The servant did not know anything in particular.\r\nHe had only heard that a boat had been upset in the Falls with two\r\nmen. Some said they were boys. People had seen them swept under the\r\nsuspension bridge. It was said that they were drowned.\r\n\r\nAt the mention of this, Bart felt for a few moments as though he were\r\nturned to stone. He could not move or speak. In those few moments there\r\nflashed across his mind the remembrance of what Pat and Phil had said\r\nabout a visit to the islands, together with mysterious hints and casual\r\nremarks that he had heard afterwards, to which at the time he had paid\r\nno attention, but which now all came back to his memory with fearful\r\ndistinctness and accuracy. From all this there arose within him the fear\r\nthat Pat and Phil had made the attempt against which he had warned them,\r\ntaking advantage of his absence, and that the boat that had been upset\r\nwas no other than theirs.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done?\r\n\r\nHe did not know what. By this time his father was home, and he at\r\nonce went to him and told him all about it. At this story Mr. Darner’s\r\nanxiety was equal to that of Bart. He himself had heard, in the course\r\nof the day, about the accident, but had never imagined that it so nearly\r\naffected him. The moment that he learned this from Bart, he at once\r\nwent forth to make further inquiries, to see what could be done, and to\r\ncommence a search in any possible way in which a search might be made.\r\n\r\nHe went first of all to the suspension bridge, and made inquiries of\r\nthe toll-keeper. That functionary was able to tell him all that could\r\nbe told. It amounted to very little. He had heard shouts on the bridge,\r\nover which two or three people were passing, and had gone out to see\r\nwhat was the matter. He had just got out in time to see two men--or\r\ntwo boys, he did not know which--swept by the current under the bridge.\r\nThere was a boat also, bottom upwards. He and all the rest stood staring\r\nin horror without doing anything. To do anything was in fact impossible.\r\nThe bridge was far above the water, precipices intervened, and the\r\ncurrent was running so fast that the figures were swept away before they\r\ncould fairly understand what had happened.\r\n\r\nWere they alive, or dead?\r\n\r\nThis was the question which Bart asked in intense anxiety and dread.\r\n\r\nThe toll-keeper could not say, but his impression at the time was, that\r\nthey were alive; he also had an idea that one of them was clinging to a\r\nbit of wood. But he would not be sure.\r\n\r\n“Could he make out their clothes--what they were like?”\r\n\r\nNo; for only their heads were above water. They had no hats. They\r\nuttered no cry, and made no noise whatever, but he did not think that\r\nthey were dead. Still they did not seem to be swimming, and the whole\r\nthing was a puzzle.\r\n\r\nUnable to get any more satisfaction from the toll-keeper, Mr. Darner\r\nnext went to the town, and made inquiries among the boatmen and\r\nfishermen. There was but one reply from all of them, and that was, that\r\nthey had seen nothing. They informed him that there had been a thick fog\r\nin the harbor all day, and a boat might drift out to sea without being\r\nnoticed. All of them thought it very unlikely that any men, after being\r\nupset in the Falls, could avoid drowning, although, at the same time,\r\nthey were willing to allow that it was just possible. But if so, the\r\nonly chance that they could have was to be picked up while in the\r\nharbor. If any men were to drift down the harbor, in the fog, without\r\nbeing observed, out into the bay, there did not seem any chance of their\r\nbeing saved.\r\n\r\nSuch was the opinion of those who knew most about it. Full of anxiety,\r\nand almost despair, Bart and his father then went elsewhere on their\r\nhopeless errand. They visited the tug-boat men, the ferry-boat men; they\r\nquestioned many of the scow men and rafts-men; but though most of these\r\nmen had heard about the accident, none of them had either seen or heard\r\nof any men, or of any boat, drifting down the harbor.\r\n\r\nThis took away from Bart and his father almost their last hope. Yet\r\nstill they were not willing to give up their search, but continued until\r\nlate into the night their now apparently hopeless task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n_At the Mercy of the Tide.--Ears deafened.--Eyes blinded.--A fresh\r\nStruggle for Life.--The Roar of the Steam Whistle.--Where are we?--Pat\r\nexplores.--A desolate Abode.--The falling Tides.--Without Food and\r\nShelter._\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE is Pat?\r\n\r\nSuch was the terrible question that came to the mind of Phil, as,\r\nclinging to the oar, he felt himself swept onward by the resistless\r\ncurrent. Far on high was the suspension bridge; on either side were\r\ndark, savage precipices, and the sweep of the tide hurried him along\r\nhelplessly between these.\r\n\r\nWhere is Pat?\r\n\r\nAt that dread question his heart sank within him. The remembrance of his\r\nrecent plunge beneath the furious billows where he had been hurled\r\ndown, and whirled round, and thrown out again, was still most vivid.\r\nHe thought of Pat as being engulfed beneath them still. His own escape\r\nseemed little short of miraculous, and he could not hope that both of\r\nthem were safe. Such an escape was astonishing for one, but for two it\r\nwas too much to hope for. He did not dare to look back. He was afraid to\r\nknow the worst, and that look back, he thought, would show him only the\r\ndark water. For a time he felt as though he would rather fear the worst,\r\nthan actually know it; and so, despairingly, he was swept on, and passed\r\nunder the bridge in the same attitude in which he had emerged from the\r\nFalls.\r\n\r\nSuddenly from behind him there sounded a cry,--\r\n\r\n“Hooray!”\r\n\r\nA thrill of joy passed through Phil. It was Pat’s voice. In an instant\r\nhis terror fled, and he looked back. There, to his amazement, close\r\nbehind him, he saw Pat, drifting along, with his face above water fully\r\nrevealed, and showing, even at that dread moment, the calm self-reliance\r\nand good-natured ease that always distinguished him. Phil was so\r\novercome with joy, that he could not say a word.\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s rather wet, so it is,” said Pat, in as natural a tone as\r\nthough he were walking along the road in a rain shower.\r\n\r\nPhil made no answer.\r\n\r\nAgain they drifted on in silence.\r\n\r\nNow, as for Pat, at the moment when the boat hung hovering on the edge\r\nof the fall, he had stood, keen, watchful, observant, with every one of\r\nhis wits about him, and had shouted out to Phil.\r\n\r\nPhil had jumped first, but Pat followed immediately. His experience\r\nwas like that of Phil, with this difference--that he was under water a\r\nlittle longer. On emerging, he saw Phil a little in front of him, and so\r\nhe felt at ease on that score. His first thought now was about the boat.\r\nHe looked back, and saw it not more than six feet behind him, bottom\r\nupwards. Upon this he was seized with a very strong desire to gain the\r\nboat once more; and so he floated on for a time, thinking what to do. At\r\nlength he made an effort to swim back towards it. The progress that he\r\nmade was scarce perceptible, and he could hardly have gained the boat\r\nby his own efforts; but, fortunately, the river current favored him, for\r\nthe boat reached a place where it was whirled round so that its stern\r\ncame close to him. A vigorous effort enabled him to seize it, and it was\r\nhis joy at this which had elicited the cry that had first given to Phil\r\nthe knowledge of his safety. The other remark, about the wetness of\r\nthe place, was merely owing to the same exultation, and was intended to\r\nconvey to Phil something of the same cheerful confidence that filled his\r\nown mind.\r\n\r\nThe boat was bottom upwards, but that was rather an advantage; for a\r\nboat can bear a heavier weight under those circumstances than if it is\r\nfilled with water in its natural position. Pat knew this very well,\r\nand proceeded at once to avail himself of this knowledge. He did so by\r\nclimbing upon it--a task which required some effort, but in which he at\r\nlength succeeded. In doing so, he was compelled to let go his oar. This,\r\nhowever, did not trouble him, for the boat was better than any oar could\r\nbe, and so he straddled upon the bottom, and began to think how he could\r\nget Phil into the same comparatively easy position.\r\n\r\nAt last he hit upon a plan.\r\n\r\n“Phil!” he cried.\r\n\r\nPhil looked round, and saw the boat, and Pat seated on it.\r\n\r\n“Shove us yer oar, darlint,” said Pat. “Can ye shove us up your oar,\r\njewel?”\r\n\r\nPat spoke in a coaxing tone, just as though he was asking some favor\r\nfrom Phil.\r\n\r\nAt this request Phil pushed the oar along the surface of the water with\r\none hand, using the other to keep himself afloat. The boat was near\r\nenough for him to reach it, and Pat, stooping down, grasped it. Then\r\npulling at it, he drew Phil towards him, until at length he also was\r\nable to grasp the boat.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Pat, “I’ll take the oar, and you jist climb up here.”\r\n\r\nHe took the oar in one hand, and reached out his other to assist Phil.\r\nPat’s help was of great value in such a difficult task, and by means\r\nof it Phil was at length able to clamber up, and straddle upon the boat\r\nbehind his friend. They found, to their delight, that the boat supported\r\nboth of them with the greatest ease. Now, had it been filled with water\r\nin its ordinary position, right side up, it could scarcely have given\r\nassistance to one of them; but as it was, it gave the most perfect\r\nsupport to both of them. The reason is easy to explain. When a boat is\r\nturned completely over, bottom upwards, so suddenly as this was, there\r\nalways remains a certain amount of air confined inside. This gives it an\r\nimmense amount of buoyancy, and until that air all escapes that buoyancy\r\ncontinues. Of course, after a time the air will all escape, and then the\r\nboat must sink beneath the weight imposed upon it. But if the boat is\r\ntight, the air will be retained, and consequently the buoyancy will\r\nremain for a long time. Now, fortunately for Phil and Pat, the boat\r\nthat they had was new, and well calked, and as tight as possible; and so\r\nthere was no immediate danger. Fortunately also for them, they had thus\r\nfar suffered nothing from cold; for it was the end of July, and the\r\nwater was rather warm, and the air was warm also. And so, though they\r\nhad experienced such a plunge into the water, and such a prolonged\r\nimmersion, and though they now sat thus in their wet clothes, yet, after\r\nall, they suffered nothing whatever from either damp or chill, but, on\r\nthe whole, were rather comfortable than otherwise.\r\n\r\nThus far they had uttered no cry for help, nor had they heard any call\r\nof any human voice that might indicate the neighborhood of any human\r\nsympathy. They had passed under the suspension bridge. They had swept\r\npast shores that were crowded on either side with wharves, houses, and\r\nsteam saw-mills, but as yet had seen no efforts to assist them. In fact,\r\nas it afterwards proved, no one had noticed them. Whether it was that\r\nevery one was busy, or that they had been carelessly regarded as an\r\nordinary boat in its ordinary position, could not be known; certain it\r\nwas that no one offered to assist them. Thus, then, they swept along,\r\nuntil at length they reached the place where the river enters the\r\nharbor. Just here, the boat, in its drift, came near to the oar which\r\nPat had dropped when he clambered into it. He grasped Phil’s oar, and\r\nreaching out, he drew it towards him and regained possession of it.\r\n\r\n“There’s no knowin,” said he, “what use this may be. It’s best to take\r\nit whin it comes to us handy.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he gave Phil one oar, and keeping the other himself, he\r\nwaited for some chance of escape.\r\n\r\nBut their troubles were far from ending as yet, and soon the prospect\r\nof escape was removed still farther from them. For as they reached the\r\nplace where the river enters the harbor, just as they saw a man on the\r\nbeach, and began to shout to him to try and attract his attention, they\r\ndrifted on, and plunged into a thick, dense cloud of fog.\r\n\r\nThat fog was no common fog. It was the advance guard of a fog that\r\ncovered the bay, and seemed to be thrown forward into the harbor to take\r\npossession and hold it until the main army should be ready to advance.\r\nIt was dense, damp, and obscure. Through this they passed, trying to\r\npeer through the gloom, and find out where they might be going. Several\r\ntimes they shouted, but soon found out the uselessness of this. For the\r\nnoise and riot all around showed them that shouting was simply absurd.\r\nAround them they heard the yell of steam whistles from tug-boats, from\r\nferry-boats, and from what seemed to be a thousand other places. For it\r\nwas now about midday, and that is the time when all the steam whistles\r\nof all the steam saw-mills of the city let off one simultaneous blast.\r\nThe yells seemed to arise in every conceivable direction. Amid such an\r\nuproar, their loudest cries were feeble, and could not be heard; so they\r\nsoon became convinced of the uselessness of this, and remained silent,\r\nbut watchful. Watchfulness, however, was equally useless; for if it\r\nis in vain that one shouts amid the yells of steam whistles, so it is\r\nequally in vain that one tries to keep up a watch in the midst of\r\na dense fog. Watching could reveal nothing but that obscurity which\r\nsurrounded them.\r\n\r\nIn this way, then, they drifted down the harbor, while the steam\r\nwhistles were yelling around them so as to stifle all their cries for\r\nhelp, and while the fog was gathering round them in its dense folds so\r\nas to obscure their sight. But the boat bore them well, and it was\r\nat least a subject of rejoicing to them that they were thus seated in\r\ncomparative comfort on that boat, instead of floating tip to their chins\r\nin the water, clinging to their oars.\r\n\r\nNeither of them spoke a word as they thus drifted. Both of them were\r\nanxiously on the lookout for some means of escape. But no way of escape\r\npresented itself. They drifted on. The time seemed long indeed as\r\nthey thus drifted, though how long it really was they had no means of\r\nknowing, and could only conjecture. On they went, and still on, and no\r\nhelp appeared, and no way of escape was visible.\r\n\r\nAt length Pat began to make use of his oar by putting it over the boat\r\ninto the water, and working it in the way called sculling; in such a\r\nway, however, as to give the boat as strong an inclination as possible\r\nto the right. It was not easy to scull, for there was no socket in which\r\nto insert the oar; but Pat did the best he could, and by holding one\r\nfoot he managed to keep the oar in a steady enough position by holding\r\nit between his foot and the keel. Phil watched him in silence for some\r\ntime, and Pat went on working at the oar with all his might.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing, Pat?” he asked at last.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Pat, without stopping, “there’s jist a ghost of a chance\r\nfor us. We’re dhriftin out to sea, an ef we sit still we’ll be miles out\r\nbefore we know it. Now there’s Partridge Island afore us yet, an it’ll\r\nbe on our right as we’re dhriftin out, an I’m strivin to see if I can\r\ngive a twisht to the boat, so as to draw her in nearer to the shore.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t I help?” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“I suppose ye may as well thry,” said Pat.\r\n\r\nUpon this Phil took his oar, and began to use it in the same way as\r\nPat. The efforts of the boys were directed, not towards resisting the\r\ncurrent, but towards effecting a movement of the boat to the right,\r\nand drawing it away from the middle of the stream to within reach of\r\nPartridge Island. This place was now their last hope.\r\n\r\n“Ef we can only get out of the sthraim,” said Pat, “we’ll get to the\r\nisland. The boat’s hard to move this way, but we may do something.”\r\n\r\nNo more was said, but they both worked silently and vigorously. Soon the\r\nwater grew somewhat rough, and waves began to rise. These were not of\r\nany size, but the boat was so low down that even the little wavelets\r\nbroke over them as they sat there. After a time these wavelets grew\r\nlarger, and at length they encountered several in succession that were\r\nworthy of being considered as waves. After this the water continued\r\nrougher, and their drift was by no means so quiet and uneventful as it\r\nhad been. The fog, too, remained as thick as ever. Around them was still\r\nthe sound of whistles and fog horns, and high and loud and clear above\r\nall the din arose one far-penetrating yell.\r\n\r\n“That’s the island whistle,” said Pat--“the fog whistle, so it is. We’re\r\ncomin nearer.”\r\n\r\nAfter a time this whistle seemed to be no nearer, but to have changed\r\nits direction.\r\n\r\n“Where in the wide wurruld are we dhjiftin to?” said Pat, trying in vain\r\nto peer through the fog.\r\n\r\n“We must have passed the island,” said Phil, uneasily.\r\n\r\nPat shook his head in silence.\r\n\r\nBut now new anxiety came to the two castaways, and the faint hopes that\r\nhad arisen began to subside. The wind was blowing somewhat fresh,\r\nthe waves were growing larger and more aggressive every moment. They\r\nappeared to have been carried beyond the island, and if so, they had\r\nno hope of any escape, unless they should come upon some vessel. But\r\nin that dense fog such a hope was faint indeed. Even in broad day their\r\nsituation would have been dangerous, but now it was nothing less than\r\ndesperate. These thoughts now came to each of them, and they said\r\nnothing, but they still worked, as if mechanically, at the oars.\r\n\r\nSuddenly something dark loomed immediately before them through the fog,\r\nand in a few seconds, as the swift tide bore them nearer, they saw rocks\r\nand sea-weed.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” cried Pat. “It’s the island, afther all.”\r\n\r\nBut at that moment the great fog whistle sent forth its blast, which\r\nsounded far away over the waters.\r\n\r\n“‘Tain’t the island, ayther, sure enough,” said Pat. “I wondher if it’s\r\nthe shore.”\r\n\r\nBy this time they were close up to the rocks, and Pat leaped off. It\r\nwas not deeper than his waist. Phil followed, and they pulled the boat\r\nforward. It was a shelving ledge of rock, covered with sea-weed; and\r\ndrawing the boat as far up on this as they could, they stood still, and\r\nrested, and looked around.\r\n\r\nBut little could be seen, for the fog was thick, and shut out all except\r\nwhat was within their immediate vicinity. Nothing but rocks and seaweed\r\nappeared. The rocks were rude and jagged crags, upheaved in wild\r\ndisorder, with huge boulders lying in the interstices and hollows. Over\r\nall these was a vast accumulation of sea-weed.\r\n\r\n“It’s ashore somewhere that we must be,” said Pat; “but where it is I\r\ndon’t know at all, at all, so I don’t; somewhere on the Carleton shore,\r\nso it is. The island’s over there, and this ought to be the baich. I’ll\r\ntell you what I’ll do. You stay here by the boat, and I’ll go off and\r\nsee if I can make out anything.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, Pat started off to explore the rocks and see the country.\r\nPhil sat down on the wet sea-weed, holding the painter. His heart was\r\nfull of fervent gratitude for his astonishing escape, and as his memory\r\nbrought back the terrible events that had happened since he left the\r\nisland, a prayer of thankfulness was breathed forth from his inmost soul\r\nto the One who had preserved him.\r\n\r\nIn a short time Pat returned. He looked disappointed, vexed, and\r\nsomewhat puzzled.\r\n\r\n“We’re not on the baich at all,” said he, in a tone of vextion.\r\n\r\n“Where are we--on an island?”\r\n\r\n“Niver an island,” said Pat. “It’s a rock that we’re on. It’s what they\r\ncall a rafe. But what it is I don’t know. It’s big enough, and runs over\r\niver so far. Anyhow, we’re not far from the harbor, or from the island.\r\nIf I ony knowed how far we were from the shore, I’d like it better. But\r\nI can’t see anything, or hear anything of it.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps we’re close by the shore,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“No; I’ll tell you where it is. I have it. I knowed it,” cried Pat. “I\r\nwas sure of it, ony I couldn’t get hold of it. Ye know that rafe lying\r\noff the Carleton shore--Shad Rocks?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s that same that this place is; and we’re standin here now, so\r\nwe are, as sure as you’re alive.”\r\n\r\n“Shad Rocks!” cried Phil. “Shad Rocks!”\r\n\r\n“Shad Rocks it is,” said Pat, “an no other place. An now I undherstan it\r\nall. Out there is the say,” said Pat, turning and facing where he\r\nsupposed the sea to be. “Up there on the lift is Partridge Island, where\r\nye hear the staim whistle, and back there’s the Carleton shore.”\r\n\r\nThis discovery cheered them both greatly; and the moment that Pat\r\nsuggested this, everything confirmed it. The sounds of whistles in\r\nvarious directions could now be identified with various steamboats with\r\nwhich they were acquainted, while the lowing of cattle and the reports\r\nof guns in other directions showed where the land was.\r\n\r\nThey now looked forward with perfect calmness towards escaping. Before\r\nvery long the tide had retreated far enough to leave the boat exposed.\r\nThe first thing that they did was to turn her over and set her right.\r\nThey then put inside her the oars, which had saved their lives in the\r\nfalls, and which they had fortunately brought with them all the time\r\nof their drift on the bottom of the boat. This gave them the means of\r\neffecting their escape.\r\n\r\nAll that they now had to do was to wait till the boat could float\r\nagain. As near as they could calculate, the tide would not be back again\r\nsufficiently to float the boat until eight o’clock in the evening. They\r\nhad therefore nothing to do but to wait as patiently as possible. They\r\nwere wet and hungry; but in that midsummer day, the wet did not make\r\nthem at all cold, and in the course of time their clothes dried upon\r\nthem; and as to hunger, they were too much overjoyed at their escape to\r\nmake any allusions to such a trivial thing. They amused themselves by\r\nhunting after shrimps in the interstices of the rocks and in the water\r\npools that lay about.\r\n\r\nThus the time passed, and at length the tide rose high enough to float\r\nthe boat. Fortunately for them also, the fog lessened somewhat, and thus\r\nthey were able to direct their course much more easily. Soon they were\r\non the waters again, rowing along, assisted now by the rising tide, and\r\nthus finally succeeded in reaching their destination.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the house, they learned about the search of Bart and his\r\nfather. They had not yet got home. Servants were at once sent to tell\r\nthem the news, and it was at the very lowest point of their despondency\r\nthat the tidings came that the lost were found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n_Flight of Solomon.--In Hiding.--Solomon is himself again.--Up the\r\nRiver.--Through the Country.--A long Drive.--An Indian Village.--An\r\nIndian Guide.--Preparing for the Expedition._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE joy which Pat and Phil had felt over their safety was certainly not\r\ngreater than that of Bart, as the lost ones were at length restored. His\r\nintense anxiety was followed by a happiness as intense, and his excited\r\nfeelings resulted in a somewhat sleepless night. But in the wakeful\r\nhours of that night his mind was taken up by other things than the\r\naffairs of Phil and Pat, and his thoughts reverted to the earlier\r\nevents of that day, to Loch Lomond, and to Solomon. He still wondered at\r\nSolomon’s precipitate and mysterious retreat, and obstinate staying away\r\nfrom the house. It looked as though Solomon did not want to go on the\r\nexpedition; yet he felt in his own heart, that without Solomon the\r\nexpedition would lose its chief charm. Consequently Solomon must go. But\r\nhow could he overcome his objections? It would be necessary to see\r\nhim at once, to drive out to Loch Lomond as early as possible the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he was up early in spite of his sleepless night, and\r\nswallowing a few hasty mouthfuls, he hurried to the barn to see about\r\nharnessing the horse. The harness was put on, the horse was already\r\nstanding between the shafts, Bart was watching the preparations\r\nimpatiently, standing in the doorway of the barn, when, suddenly, he\r\nfelt his shoulder touched.\r\n\r\nHe turned at once.\r\n\r\nHe stood thunderstruck!\r\n\r\nFor there, close beside him, full before him, was no other than the\r\nactual real bodily presence of Solomon himself.\r\n\r\nBart was so amazed, that for some time he could not utter one single\r\nword.\r\n\r\n“Solomon!” he exclaimed at last.\r\n\r\nAt this, Solomon held up both hands with a warning gesture and a face\r\nfull of fearful apprehension. The look and gesture would have been in\r\nevery way appropriate to some criminal hiding from the law, and fearful\r\nof discovery; but it was utterly out of place in one so virtuous and so\r\nhonored as the venerable Solomon. This incongruity was felt by Bart, and\r\nonly added to his amazement.\r\n\r\n“When did you come?”\r\n\r\nSolomon retreated behind the door, dragging Bart after him.\r\n\r\n“Last night,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“Last night? How?”\r\n\r\n“I walked ebery step--I did.”\r\n\r\n“Walked?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, ebery step. I rund away, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Ran away? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\nSolomon’s eyes rolled wildly; he looked all around.\r\n\r\n“Drefful doins out dar. Drefful place. An dar’s no noins what would hab\r\nebber become ob me ef you didn’t hab come yesterday. I’d been a pinin an\r\na whinin in Gypsum bondage, but couldn’t get away. She kept tight\r\nhole ob me,--mine, I tell you,--an she’ll be arter me to-day, mighty\r\nquick,--ony you keep me hid, Mas’r Bart. Don’t gib me up; don’t let her\r\ntake me.”\r\n\r\n“She? Her?” replied Bart, to whom all this was quite unintelligible.\r\n“What do you mean? What woman are you speaking of?”\r\n\r\n“Black Betsy,” said Solomon, with a groan and another fearful roll of\r\nthe eyes.\r\n\r\n“Black Betsy? Why, what has she to do with you?” asked Bart, in wonder.\r\n\r\n“Why, she my wife, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Your wife? Your what? Your wife?” cried Bart. “What! Black Betsy! You\r\nmarried to Black Betsy! What in the world do you mean by this? When were\r\nyou married? Last week?”\r\n\r\n“Ben mar’d ober twenty year,” said Solomon, dolefully.\r\n\r\nThis was a period of remote antiquity with which Bart had no connection,\r\nand he could only listen in amazement to Solomon’s strange and startling\r\ndisclosure. He had never heard of this before. He had no idea that\r\nSolomon had a wife, or that Black Betsy had a husband. But this thing\r\nrequired examination, and meanwhile the horse was all ready. As for the\r\nhorse, he could only give orders to have him taken out, and then he was\r\nable to bestow his undivided attention upon Solomon.\r\n\r\n“Ben mar’d mor’n twenty year,” replied Solomon, dolefully. “An you\r\nnebber see sech a strorny creetur in all your born days. Fight? Why, dat\r\nar woman did nuffin but fight from morn to night, all de year roun. An\r\ndrunk? Why, she nebber sober, night or day; an de life she led me! Beat?\r\nWhy, she beat me black and blue; so I rund off to sea, and a bressed\r\nting it was, for I ben dead an gone long ago. Den I heerd she gone off\r\nBoston way, an I come back yer, an den went to de Cadmy. Well, I got a\r\nmar’d darter out Loch Lomon way, an I come yer dis time to see her and\r\nde chil’en; an dar was Betsy. She nabbed me. She beat my life out, made\r\nme a slabe, and I done nuffin but grub about ebber since I come yar.\r\nBeat? Why, ebery day she pound me to a jelly. Clar if she didn’t! An de\r\nway she did lay dat ar big broomstick ober dis ole head. De sakes, ony\r\nto tink ob it.”\r\n\r\nFrom all of which Bart learned that Black Betsy was the wife of Solomon;\r\nthat her character, according to his showing, was by no means that\r\ngentle, and affectionate, and motherly one which he had supposed it to\r\nhe; that her life was disorderly, and her conduct outrageous; that she\r\nwas in the habit of getting drunk; that Solomon had to run away from\r\nher years ago, and become an exile and a wanderer; that it was only his\r\nyearning after his daughter that had drawn him back; that, on meeting\r\nhis daughter, he had found himself, to his horror, once more in the\r\npresence of his merciless wife, who had at once seized him, appropriated\r\nhim, beaten him, and reduced him to a state of abject slavery. From this\r\nslavery he had just escaped. He now appeared before Bart in the attitude\r\nof a fugitive slave, dreading discovery and capture, imploring Bart’s\r\nsympathy and assistance, and eager, above all things, to fly far away,\r\nand follow the fortunes of the boys on a new expedition; once more\r\nto join the ranks of the B. O. W. C.; once more to officiate as Grand\r\nPanjandrum; once more to furnish forth the banquet; once more to sail\r\nunder the orders of Captain Corbet.\r\n\r\nSolomon’s position was a truly painful one, and excited Bart’s\r\nprofoundest sympathy; but there were other things in his position which\r\nwere not altogether painful. In the first place, he was delighted to\r\nfind that, whatever the reason might be, Solomon’s eagerness to set\r\nforth upon the expedition was equal to his own, if not greater. In the\r\nsecond place, Solomon wished to remain in hiding, and implored Bart to\r\nconceal him and keep his secret. So Bart found himself suddenly called\r\non to become the benefactor and protector of a cherished friend, and\r\nalso the depositary of a tremendous secret, which he had to guard like\r\nhis heart’s blood. It was a secret which must be communicated to none,\r\nnot even to Phil and Pat, not to his father or mother, in fact, not to\r\nany living soul. Fortunately, the servant had not seen Solomon, for that\r\nwary old party had discovered himself to Bart so cautiously, and had\r\ndrawn him back into the barn to talk to him so carefully, that he had\r\nnot been seen.\r\n\r\nSo Bart undertook the task. He found a safe place for Solomon behind the\r\nhay, and at regular intervals through the day he brought him food and\r\ndrink. These regular intervals occurred so frequently, that Bart spent\r\nthe greater part of that day in vibrating like a pendulum between the\r\nhouse and barn. Had Solomon remained in this hiding-place for any length\r\nof time, it is certain that Bart’s assiduous attentions and air\r\nof mystery would have led to a discovery; but as it happened, the\r\nconcealment was not needed for any longer time.\r\n\r\nAll that day, while Bart had been thus performing the part of a faithful\r\nfriend, he had also been forwarding to the utmost the preparations\r\nfor the coming journey. These preparations consisted chiefly in\r\nfishing-tackle of various kinds. One day was quite sufficient for this,\r\nand so, on the day after, the whole party left. Their departure took\r\nplace at sunrise. Solomon had left before them, and had gone in the\r\nearly morning twilight to the steamer in which they were to embark,\r\nwhere he had concealed himself behind a row of flour barrels. At seven\r\no’clock the boat started. The boys walked forward, and there, to the\r\nutter amazement of Phil and Pat, the first object that met their eyes\r\nwas Solomon. They had only heard Bart’s account of his unsuccessful\r\nvisit, and had given him up. But now he appeared, radiant, joyous,\r\necstatic; and though a large, white smouch was over his right cheek,\r\ncaused by his lying down with his face pressed against a flour barrel,\r\nyet that white spot did not at all detract from the exultant and\r\ntriumphant expression that overspread his face. His little black beads\r\nof eyes twinkled with delight; his legs went hopping up from the deck in\r\nall directions; and he would certainly then and there have indulged in a\r\nreal, original, genuine, plantation break-down, had not rheumatiz gently\r\nreminded him that there were limits to the exercise of his muscular\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nThe route which they took to the Bay de Chaleur was apparently a\r\nroundabout one; but in reality it was the shortest way to get to their\r\ndestination. First they went up the river St. John, and after a time\r\nthey intended to turn off into the country.\r\n\r\nAs they sailed up that beautiful river, they gazed with admiration upon\r\nthe varying scenes that opened upon them every moment. With that river\r\nand its features Bart was quite familiar; but the others had never seen\r\nit before, and were never tired of looking out upon the surrounding\r\nvalley. First of all they found themselves in a narrow gorge shut in by\r\nprecipices. Emerging from this, they entered a broad expanse of water\r\nlooking like an extensive lake. Traversing this, the river narrowed\r\nagain, and the sheet of water ran on before their eyes in a straight\r\nline for many miles, with high hills, some wooded, some cultivated on\r\neither side. Passing on, they left this behind; and now the course of\r\nthe river was a winding one, leading them on amidst varied scenery\r\nof high hills and fertile valleys. Beyond this, again, the high hills\r\ndeparted, and a broad extent of meadow land, dotted with groves\r\nand orchards and white farm-houses, and covered over with luxuriant\r\nvegetation, spread away on every side as far as the eye could reach.\r\nHere the scene was not so varied as it had been at first, but it was\r\nrich and glorious, showing to them a favored land, a land flowing with\r\nmilk and honey. This rich and fertile land continued till the steamer\r\nstopped at Fredericton.\r\n\r\nHere they passed the night, and hired a carriage to take them to the\r\nRiver Miramichi, a place which lay on the way between Fredericton and\r\nthe Bay de Chaleur.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning they crossed the ferry, and after a short drive\r\nthey reached another river, a branch of the St. John, which rejoices in\r\nthe name of the Nashwaak. The river was small, but they thought it one\r\nof the most beautiful that they had ever seen. High hills covered with\r\nforests arose on every side, now coming up close and shutting in the\r\nwaters, again receding and leaving rich meadow lands, through which the\r\nriver flowed with many a winding.\r\n\r\nAt midday they stopped at a pretty little inn by the road-side, and\r\nbeguiled the time during which they had to wait for dinner by trying\r\ntheir hands at trouting. Bart and Phil caught two small trout apiece;\r\nPat hooked one; while Solomon actually landed a salmon--an event which\r\ncreated intense excitement in the whole party.\r\n\r\nIn the evening they reached another place, where they stopped for the\r\nnight. The next day they resumed their journey, and in the afternoon\r\narrived at the village of Chatham, which is situated on the banks of the\r\nRiver Miramichi.\r\n\r\nAnd now the boys made a discovery, which, strangely enough, had not\r\nsuggested itself before. It was the simple fact that they had started\r\naltogether too soon. This was the third of August, but the Rawdons and\r\nTom would not meet them until the fifteenth. There was therefore nearly\r\na fortnight’s time on their hands. No thought of regret, however, arose\r\nin the minds of any of them; but the fact that they had so much time\r\nto spare, at once set them all to work to contrive some way of enjoying\r\nthemselves. Various suggestions were made. One was, that they should\r\nvisit the different, settlements in all the country around; another,\r\nthat they should go straight to Shippegan, get a schooner or a\r\nfishing-boat, and explore the Bay de Chaleur. Both of these plans,\r\nhowever, were rejected, in favor of the superior attractions of a third\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nThis was, to plunge into the woods, wander about, fish, explore, and\r\nrough it generally. They could take a little stock of provisions with\r\nthem, but trust chiefly to the fish which they might catch. They could\r\nbuild camps, and sleep in them, and cook their fish themselves by their\r\nown fires. Bart spoke to the landlord about the feasibility of this\r\nplan, and that worthy approved of it highly, but told them that they\r\nwould have to take some Indian guide with them.\r\n\r\nHad the guide been English, Irish, Scotch, or American, the boys would\r\nprobably have felt some objections; but being an Indian, the idea had\r\noverpowering fascinations for them. There was a dash of romance about an\r\nIndian guide that lent additional attractions to the proposed excursion.\r\n\r\nThe landlord informed them that there was an Indian settlement opposite,\r\nand that if they went over there they might find a guide, and make a\r\nbargain with him.\r\n\r\nAll this was settled on the evening of the day in which they had\r\narrived, and early on the following morning they crossed the river on a\r\nvisit to the Indian settlement, in search of a guide.\r\n\r\nThe Indian settlement was not a very extensive one. It consisted of\r\nabout a dozen wigwams. These camps are constructed of poles set together\r\nin a conical shape, and covered over with birch bark, a substance that\r\nwith them is made to serve a wonderful number of purposes. On\r\nentering the settlement, a number of dogs came up and smelt them very\r\ndeliberately. They saw a number of children, who, at their approach,\r\ndarted inside the nearest camp. Old squaws were busy cooking. One or two\r\nIndians were engaged in making baskets. The whole scene had a peaceful,\r\nprimitive, and romantic character. It was clean, too; for though an\r\nIndian camp has no architectural pretensions, yet it rarely gives forth\r\nthose overpowering odors which are encountered on approaching many of\r\nthe houses of the more civilized races.\r\n\r\nAn Indian advanced to meet the boys.\r\n\r\n“Good day, brother,” said Bart; for in this country it is the fashion to\r\naddress an Indian by this fraternal title.\r\n\r\n“Good day, broder,” said the Indian, in a friendly way.\r\n\r\nHe was rather old, fearfully wrinkled, and his long, coarse hair reached\r\nto his shoulders. As Bart looked at him, it struck him that this man\r\nwould be a most desirable guide; his age made him trustworthy, while,\r\nat the same time, his sturdy frame and sinewy limbs showed that he\r\npossessed all the powers of endurance that might be desired.\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts Bart made known to him the object of his visit. As\r\nhe spoke, the other Indians listened with much interest, and addressed\r\nremarks to one another, accompanied with glances at the boys, which\r\nseemed to afford them great amusement; for smiles came over their grave\r\nfaces, and some of the younger squaws giggled, and numbers of little\r\nheads were poked out through the doors of several wigwams, and numbers\r\nof little sparkling black wild eyes were fixed upon the visitors to the\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nThe Indian whom they had accosted thought for some time over Bart’s\r\nquestion, and then addressed some remarks to the others. Some\r\nconversation followed, which, of course, was not intelligible to the\r\nboys, since it was carried on in the language of these Indians. At\r\nlength the one whom Bart was talking with informed him that he would be\r\nwilling to go himself as guide.\r\n\r\n“Me go; me go; takum you troom wood. Me good guide, fus rate; go often.\r\nMy name Sam.”\r\n\r\nAt this Bart was overjoyed.\r\n\r\n“You wantum shoot?” asked the Indian.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bart, with a feeling of intense regret, “only to fish.”\r\n\r\n“Berry well, fishum; all same. Me show all aboutum. When you go?”\r\n\r\nBart said that he wanted to set out that very day, if he could.\r\n\r\n“Me all ready,” said Sam. “Go now, or to-morrow; all same.”\r\n\r\nUpon this Bart said that they would go back to get their things, and\r\nreturn by noon, when they might all set out together.\r\n\r\nThey now went back and gathered together the things that they considered\r\nnecessary. The Indian went over with them. After further conversation\r\nwith Sam, Bart thought that it would be better to drive for about twenty\r\nmiles, and then take to the woods. That would save them a long and\r\nuseless tramp, and bring them at once to the very scene of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A long Drive, and a long Walk.--The wild Woods.--An Encampment.--The\r\nblazing Fire.--Lo! the poor Indian.--The Wolf and the Watch-dog.--\r\nThe Spring of the Wild Beast.--Solomon to the Rescue.--A Fight, and a\r\nFlight._\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER a drive of about twenty miles, they came to a place where the\r\nroad turned off towards the east. They had been heading thus far in a\r\nnortherly direction, and at this turning-off place a path went from the\r\nroad in the same northerly direction in which it had gone. At this place\r\nthey got out of the wagon, and prepared to follow their guide into the\r\nwoods. Each one took the load which he had already made up for himself,\r\nand the wagon then returned.\r\n\r\nThey did not care to burden themselves too greatly upon this expedition,\r\nand so the load which each one took was as light as possible. Bart,\r\nPhil, and Pat had each a basket slung from the neck, and a fishing-rod.\r\nIn each basket was a parcel of ham sandwiches, which they had procured\r\nat the inn, with the intention of using them as a kind of relish, in\r\naddition to their ordinary wood fare, Solomon contented himself with a\r\nbasket only. His fishing apparatus he carried in his pocket. He wasn’t\r\ngwine to bodder his ole head, he said, with dem poles--he could cut one\r\nin the woods when he wanted one, and throw it away when he got tired\r\nof it. Solomon’s years seemed to be adverse to his taking part in an\r\nexpedition like this, but in spite of this he waddled along quite as\r\nfast as any of them. One precaution he had taken which none of the rest\r\nhad considered necessary, and that was, to bring with him a check shawl,\r\nwhich Bart had lent him. This he did for fear of his ever watchful\r\nenemy, the rheumatiz.\r\n\r\nThe path was at first very well beaten; but after about a mile or so, it\r\ngradually faded away, and the track that they followed after this was so\r\nfaint as to be scarcely discernible. The woods consisted chiefly of pine\r\ntrees, with birch and maple intermixed. None of these trees were very\r\nlarge, and they did not see any of those forest giants which had met\r\ntheir view in other places. In some places the underbrush was very\r\ndense, but in other places there was scarcely any. Sometimes the ground\r\nwas quite bare and slippery with the accumulation of pine spires that\r\nhad fallen there; again, they came to immense growths of fern; and\r\nyet again to the young growth of the forest trees, springing in wild\r\nluxuriance, all tangled and matted together.\r\n\r\nAt length even the faint outline of a path which they had been\r\ntraversing for some time faded away, and they walked on after the guide,\r\nwithout following any path at all. The land was quite level. They found\r\nno hills, and no rocks even. Sometimes a fallen tree lay in front of\r\nthem, but it was never of sufficient size to create any obstacle. The\r\nchief irregularities in the ground were caused by an occasional mound,\r\nthat seemed to mark the place where a tree had once been. Frequently\r\nthey came to little brooks that babbled along beneath the trees, their\r\nborders overgrown with moss; and often they came to bogs and swamps, in\r\nsome of which they got wet enough to acquire a very good foretaste of\r\nthe experiences that now lay before them. But this was a trifle beneath\r\ntheir consideration, and the ease with which they advanced filled them\r\nall with the greatest delight.\r\n\r\nAt length they came to a stop.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of a pine forest. Overhead, the trees interlaced\r\ntheir branches. Beneath, the ground was dry, and covered with slippery\r\npine spires. It was a slight declivity, and at the bottom a brook ran\r\nalong. No better place could be wished than this for a night’s rest.\r\n\r\n“Good place dis,” said Sam; “him dry--sleepum safe--wakum all well.”\r\n\r\nThe boys were all very well pleased to find their march at an end. They\r\nhad been on the steady tramp for at least two hours, and had penetrated\r\nfar into the forest. Already the sky above was overcast, and the forest\r\nshades were deepening.\r\n\r\nAll things betokened the approach of evening and of night.\r\n\r\nThey flung down their baskets and poles, and then flung themselves down\r\ntoo, and stretched their weary limbs upon the ground. Solomon took off\r\nhis basket, and put it down in a more leisurely fashion, and took up\r\nmore time in depositing his own aged frame upon the ground.\r\n\r\n“Well, boys,” said Bart, after a short time of rest, in which he had\r\nstretched himself and yawned to his heart’s content, “it’s all very well\r\nto sit down and rest, but it’s rather dark here under the trees, and\r\nit’s going to be darker, and we can’t-ex-pect to get to sleep for at\r\nleast a couple of hours. How can we manage to exist, sitting here in the\r\ndark? I’m sure I can’t for one; so let’s make a fire.”\r\n\r\nThe proposal was at once adopted with the utmost eagerness. They had all\r\nfelt a certain degree of cheerlessness, and did not know exactly what\r\nthe cause was; but now they saw that it was the darkness, and they\r\nknew that any friendly firelight, however small, would make all the\r\ndifference in the world.\r\n\r\nThey now distributed themselves in different directions for the sake of\r\nprocuring fuel. Under that pine forest it was not very easy to find\r\nany. At length, by dint of careful search and unwearying industry, they\r\nsucceeded in gathering a very respectable amount, which they deposited\r\nin a heap near the place where they had first sat down. The wood which\r\nthey thus gathered was not very promising. What was dry was rotten\r\ntwigs, and what was sound was green wood; but they did not complain. In\r\norder to find a fuel that was midway between these two extremes, they\r\nwent off after pine branches. These they cut from the smaller trees with\r\ntheir pocket knives. Then they gathered some pine cones and bits of dry\r\nbark, and with these succeeded in kindling a fire. Over this they put\r\nthe dry twigs, then the pine branches, and last of all the green wood.\r\nThe fire thus carefully prepared was quite a success; the flames rose up\r\nmerrily, and soon the friendly blaze illumined the gathering gloom.\r\n\r\nAround this they now sat, and partook of their evening repast. The\r\nrepast consisted of ham sandwiches, and their drink was water from the\r\nneighboring brook.\r\n\r\nWhile they were seated round the fire they noticed that their guide drew\r\nforth a black junk bottle, and began to take large and frequent draughts\r\nfrom it. The smell showed them plainly that it was spirits, and this\r\ndiscovery filled them all with uneasiness. They were afraid that their\r\nguide would make himself drunk at the very outset of their expedition;\r\nand if so, what could they do with a drunken Indian? Sam had probably\r\nprocured the villanous “fire-water” when he crossed with them to\r\nChatham, before starting, and had brought it here with the express\r\npurpose of swallowing the whole of it that night.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the intoxicating liquor were soon only too apparent. He\r\nbegan to talk with such volubility that his broken English was scarcely\r\nintelligible. As far as they could make out, he was trying to tell\r\nthem about the best places there were for fishing and shooting, and\r\nillustrating his remarks with incoherent anecdotes about various parties\r\nwhich he had accompanied through these forests.\r\n\r\nBut as he went on he grew more and more excited, and at length gave up\r\nbroken English, and spoke to them in his own language. Of course this\r\nmade him totally unintelligible. There was now something that seemed to\r\nthem uncanny in the sight of this man, as he sat there, half out of his\r\nsenses, talking at them vociferously and volubly in his unintelligible\r\njargon. It put an end to all their own conversation, and to all their\r\npleasure. It was bad enough to be here; but to be here with a drunken\r\nIndian, a crazy savage, was too much.\r\n\r\nBut the Indian kept on. He still applied the bottle to his lips at short\r\nintervals, and continued his wild gabble as before. At first, he had\r\nbeen speaking to them, and now he seemed to be addressing his remarks\r\nto space; for his eyes were not any longer turned towards them, but were\r\nrolling in all directions,--sometimes resting on the trees, sometimes on\r\nthe fire. He grew more and more excited. Holding the bottle in one hand,\r\nhe swung it around, and with the other he made energetic gestures, which\r\nhe used to give emphasis to his statements. His voice also gradually\r\nchanged. At first it was natural; and so long as he spoke English, there\r\nhad been nothing in it to excite particular attention; but when he broke\r\nforth in his native language, it grew deeper and more guttural, and\r\nstranger and more barbaric.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0097]\r\n\r\nThe long Indian monotone and drawl became intensified by him, and was\r\ndeveloped into something that sounded like a strange, unearthly chant;\r\nand this fierce sing-song chant only served to increase the wild and\r\nsavage effect of the whole.\r\n\r\nHere, then, were the boys, in the midst of the lonely forest, face to\r\nface with a drunken Indian. The fire was flaming up, and its blaze shone\r\nupon the Indian, and threw a baleful glow upon his dusky face. He\r\nsat opposite to them, his long hair tangled and matted, his brows\r\ncontracted, his bright, black eyes rolling restlessly in their orbits,\r\nthe deep-wrinkled face revealed with startling distinctness against the\r\ndark background of the forest, and showing all the incessant working\r\nof its muscles, and the rapid play of its features. With his bottle\r\nclutched in one hand, and the other hand making fierce gesticulations,\r\nall the time he kept howling out unintelligible sounds in a whining\r\nguttural--a monotonous, but furious sing-song chant. Such was the scene\r\nbefore them; and it was no wonder that it excited some uneasiness.\r\n\r\nWhat could they do?\r\n\r\nThey did not know.\r\n\r\nWhat would this Indian do?\r\n\r\nThis also they could not know.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in his appearance that could reassure them. Every\r\nmoment he grew worse and worse. If this sort of thing went on much\r\nlonger, he might grow violent enough to make an attack upon them.\r\nAlready he looked far more like a wild beast than a human being. The\r\nmaddening fumes of the liquor might excite the natural ferocity of his\r\nrace, and urge him on to deeds of horror. They had no security whatever\r\nagainst such a suspicion, and no means whatever of defending themselves\r\nfrom any sudden attack.\r\n\r\nAs for Solomon, he had been watching the Indian most attentively all\r\nthis time, and the sight of this wild associate had produced upon\r\nhim quite as strong an effect as upon the boys, though of a totally\r\ndifferent kind. Had the boys not been so fascinated by the Indian as to\r\nbe unable to withdraw their gaze, and had they looked at Solomon, they\r\nwould have been astonished at the change that had suddenly come over\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe had been seated a little in the background, in a lazy, reclining\r\nposture, when his attention was aroused by the conduct of the Indian. He\r\nstarted up and sat erect for a time. Then, as the Indian grew worse,\r\nhe became more excited. He rose up on his knees, and remained in\r\nthat position--watchful and eager. At length, as the Indian grew more\r\nfurious, the excitement of Solomon increased to a proportionate degree.\r\nHe rose gradually to his feet, and stood there, eager, attentive,\r\nvigilant; every nerve on the stretch; his body advanced, his arms bent,\r\nhis fists clinched, his brows contracted, his lips compressed, his eyes\r\nkindling with a dull glow; and as the flames illumined his dusky face\r\nand figure, they revealed a sight which was quite as impressive as that\r\nother spectacle upon which the eyes of the boys were fastened.\r\n\r\nThe old man was transformed. He was no longer the shambling, free\r\nand easy, indolent, gabbling, ridiculous, affectionate, rheumatic,\r\npottering, and apparently feeble old Solomon, whom the boys had known\r\nand loved. He was changed. He was another being. As the feeble woman is\r\nroused to frenzy, and becomes transformed at the approach of danger to\r\nher child, so Solomon, at the suspicion of possible danger to his boys,\r\nhis “chickens,” his “chil’en,” whom he loved with all the strength and\r\ndevotion of his faithful and affectionate old heart, dropped his old\r\nself altogether. He became changed into the fierce, watchful, vigilant\r\nchampion and defender of those whom he loved. Perhaps there was also\r\nsome of the savagery of his African blood, and the natural ferocity of\r\nhis race, which, long slumbering, had burst forth at that moment, at\r\nthe impulse of his brother savage. But as it is difficult to imagine\r\nany taint of savagery, however faint, in one like Solomon, his\r\npresent attitude may best be accounted for on the ground of his living\r\nwatchfulness over the boys.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, there he stood, firm as a rock, and rigid as steel,--like a\r\nwatch-dog awaiting the onset of the wolf. His “rheumatiz” was forgot in\r\nthe excitement of that tremendous moment, just as the soldier, in the\r\nardor of battle, is unconscious of dangerous wounds.\r\n\r\nAt length a crisis approached.\r\n\r\nThe Indian had gone on as before, growing more and more furious every\r\nmoment. His eyes rolled fearfully. He had drunk most of the contents\r\nof the bottle, and his brain was on fire. His voice grew hoarser and\r\nhoarser, his gestures more violent, and his manner more threatening; his\r\nutterances were still of that sing-song character already mentioned,\r\nbut they had now become almost unearthly in their intonations. What mad\r\nthoughts there might be in his mind at that time could not be known;\r\nnor could they imagine the exciting visions that were wrought in his\r\ndistracted brain. Whatever they were, they at length passed away; and\r\nhis eyes, that had been rolling at vacancy, now steadied themselves, and\r\nsuddenly fastened themselves upon the boys with a look of concentrated\r\nhate and fury that was terrible.\r\n\r\nSo terrible was that look, that the boys all shrank back in horror. Then\r\nthey started up to their feet, and stood close together, in silence,\r\neach nerving his young heart for the coming struggle, which now seemed\r\nimminent. As they thus stood, they were on a line with Solomon; but\r\ntheir attention was so occupied with the Indian that they neither\r\nthought of him nor saw him.\r\n\r\n“Let’s stick together,” said Bart at length in hurried tones--“it’s our\r\nonly chance.”\r\n\r\n“Stick it is,” said Pat, who had recovered his coolness, “through thick\r\nand thin.”\r\n\r\nPhil said nothing, but stood his ground with the others, and waited.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the boys had excited the Indian still more. A furious\r\ncry escaped him. He looked at them for a moment, and then moved to the\r\nright, and flung his bottle into the fire. The spirits poured out, and\r\nthe blaze threw a bluish, ghastly glare over the scene. Then the madman\r\ngave a terrible yell, and rushed towards the boys.\r\n\r\nThe boys saw him coming. They stood firm. They gathered up all their\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly a dark shadow darted forward, and a dark figure flung\r\nitself against the Indian. It was Solomon. Watchful, eager, fierce, he\r\nhad waited for the onset, and as the Indian advanced he made his spring.\r\nRushing upon him, he struck him on the side, and the onset was so\r\nunexpected that the Indian had not time to guard against it. He fell to\r\nthe ground. In a moment Solomon was upon him. He twined his legs around\r\nhim. He grasped the savage by the throat. To that throat he clung with\r\na death like tenacity, never relaxing that iron grasp, that convulsive\r\ngrip, but clinging, holding, tightening his clutch all the more as his\r\nenemy strove to shake him off.\r\n\r\nThe boys stood there looking on in speechless amazement. They recognized\r\nSolomon, but could scarcely believe their own eyes. Where had Solomon\r\ngained that bounding activity, that tremendous strength and energy,\r\nwhich now availed him even against the madman’s fury? Could this be\r\nSolomon--the one who was afraid of his own superstitious fancies--the\r\none who had just been in miserable thraldom to a drunken wife? It seemed\r\nincredible. Yet that this was Solomon himself they saw plainly.\r\n\r\nThe struggle was most violent. The Indian gasped, and groaned, and\r\nwrithed, and sought to free himself from the grasp of his assailant. But\r\nSolomon’s grip could not be shaken off. He devoted all his strength to\r\nthat one thing, and did not waste any of his energies in any useless\r\nefforts. The Indian’s struggles grew weaker. He was suffocating from\r\nthat grasp on his throat. Had he been younger, he might have overpowered\r\nSolomon; but he was an old man himself, perhaps quite as old as Solomon,\r\nand therefore he was not so superior in strength as might be supposed.\r\n\r\nAnd now a mighty feeling of triumph swelled through Solomon’s heart, and\r\nchased away the furious impulse that had animated him to this assault.\r\nThe fainting efforts and the relaxing limbs of his enemy showed that the\r\nvictory was his. A softer feeling now came over him, mingling with his\r\ntriumph--he thought of the boys whom he had saved.\r\n\r\nHe turned his head and raised himself slightly.\r\n\r\n“Nebber you fear, chil’en,” he said--“he do you no harm now.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly the Indian made one last convulsive effort. Had Solomon not\r\nbeen speaking to the boys he could have resisted even this last throe of\r\ndespair; but as it was, his attention was for the moment distracted, and\r\nhe was taken by surprise. The Indian tore himself loose from Solomon’s\r\ngrasp, jerked himself up by a mighty effort upon one knee, and threw\r\nhimself free from his assailant. Both were now on their feet, facing\r\none another, panting heavily. Once more the fury of the fight raged in\r\nSolomon’s heart. He stood poised--he prepared for a spring. The Indian’s\r\nstrength lay in his madness; the strength of Solomon lay in his devotion\r\nto the boys--in the frenzy of his love and anxiety for their safety.\r\n\r\nThe boys came forward. This time they would not let Solomon fight their\r\nbattle. They would assist him, and lend all their united strength\r\nto crush their savage assailant. It was one common impulse, part of\r\nself-preservation, part of regard for Solomon, that animated them, and\r\nthey sprang to his side and waited.\r\n\r\nAll this was the work of a moment.\r\n\r\nAnother moment and Solomon would once more have made his tiger-spring,\r\nand flung himself upon the madman.\r\n\r\nBut that moment had sufficed for the Indian to take breath, and to\r\nreceive a new impulse. This, time it was not hate or destructive fury.\r\nIt was terror. The terrible struggle from which he had escaped with\r\nsuch difficulty had given a new turn to his frenzied thoughts. Fear\r\novermastered him. A stifled exclamation escaped him. He started back.\r\n\r\nThen he turned and ran.\r\n\r\nHe ran for his life; and in a few moments he had passed out of sight,\r\nand was lost amid the gloom of the forest and the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n_Passing the Night.--On Guard.--The watchful Sentinel.--Plans.--Through\r\nthe Woods.--The winding River.--Fishing.--The overcast Sky. Arrival of\r\nPat with startling Tidings.--A useless Search._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR a few moments the whole party stood, confounded by this new and\r\nsudden turn which events had taken.\r\n\r\n“He’s gone, anyhow,” said Pat, who was the first to break the silence.\r\n\r\nThe other boys said nothing. As for Solomon, he stared for a few moments\r\nall around, and then quietly seated himself by the fire.\r\n\r\n“Well, of all de cur’ousest an strornar est things!” he exclaimed.\r\n“Ef dis don’t beat all creation holler, den I’m a niggar. An me in a\r\nfight--a rail battle; no play, mind you; but a fight for life and def.\r\nClar ef I can understan it.”\r\n\r\nAnd Solomon buried his head in his hands, quite overcome.\r\n\r\n“Anyhow,” he resumed after a pause, “ye see how it was, chil’en. Dat\r\nar demon was a plungin an a jumpin, an I see he was makin for you; so\r\nI ‘termined I’d hab a shy at him. Couldn’t stan dat ar nohow. Ain’t a\r\nfightin man; but dat ar Ingin war so dreadful aggravatin; mor’n flesh\r\nan blood could stan. Anyhow, I did gib him nuff ob it for one spell; an\r\nhe’ll tink twicet afore he tackle any ob us agin.”\r\n\r\n“I never was so astonished in my life,” said Bart. “And how you did\r\npitch into him!” he continued, admiringly. “Why, you gave a leap like a\r\ntiger. Down he went, with you on top--at his throat.”\r\n\r\nSolomon laughed long, joyously, and uproariously. He chuckled, he\r\ngiggled, he slapped his knees, and finally he threw himself flat on his\r\nback, and lay there, laughing, chuckling, crowing, and making a confused\r\nmedley of noises, all of which were intended by him to be expressive of\r\ntriumph and exultation.\r\n\r\n“Clar ef I know what ebber did git hold ob me dat time,” he said, in\r\nthe intervals of his laughter. “Specs I mus hab gone clean mad an rabin\r\nstracted. Didn’t tink dar was so much clar fight in me. Ain’t such a\r\nrheumatic old nig, arter all. Fight any drunken Ingin on de face ob de\r\nerf. Ki yi! Yep! Ho-o-o-o-o! Dat’s so.”\r\n\r\nAt all this the boys looked on without saying anything, wondering at the\r\nchange. Could this be the same man, thought Bart, that had always seemed\r\nso helpless? whose “rheumatiz” seemed always to prevent the slightest\r\nexertion? Could this be the same Solomon who allowed himself to be\r\ncaptured by a parcel of Gaspereaugian boys? Could this be the same man\r\nwhom he had seen only a day or two before, cowering and cringing at\r\nthe sight of an angry woman? Was the Solomon over whom Black Betsy\r\nhad tyrannized so remorselessly indeed the same one who had just flung\r\nhimself at the throat of a madman, and overpowered him? It seemed\r\nincredible.\r\n\r\nYet it was no other. Already Solomon was himself again, his old natural\r\nself. Already he began to investigate his joints, and to murmur doleful\r\nanticipations of a fresh attack of rheumatiz. But the boys had other\r\nthings than this to think of. The question now was, how to pass the\r\nnight. They did not feel altogether safe. The madman who had just\r\nthreatened them had fled; but it seemed to them as though he was still\r\nlurking somewhere near them in the shadow of the gloomy forest, waiting\r\nhis chance; waiting till they should go to sleep, so that he might rush\r\nupon them unawares. If they wished to sleep at all, it would never do,\r\nthey thought, for them to sleep here with the firelight shining upon\r\nthem, and revealing them to the gaze of their enemy. They must seek some\r\nother place.\r\n\r\nOn mentioning this to Solomon, he objected very strongly.\r\n\r\n“Dar’s no danger, chil’en,” he said. “Dat ar Injun won’t ebber come back\r\nagin. He darsn’t. He nebber forget my grip. I frikend dat ar Injun away\r\nforebbermo.”\r\n\r\n“O, that’s the very reason why he’ll be back,” said Bart. “He’ll wait\r\ntill we’re all asleep, and then attack us. He’ll make a sudden spring at\r\nyou first.”\r\n\r\n“No, he won’t,” said Solomon; “nebba. He don’t do dat ar wid dis chile.”\r\n\r\n“How can you prevent him if you’re asleep?”\r\n\r\n“Cos I don’t’tend goin to sleep; dat’s how,” said Solomon. “Got him dar,\r\nanyhow. Yah, yah, yah.”\r\n\r\n“What! do you intend to watch?”\r\n\r\n“Jes so. I pose on dis yar solemn casion, my spected friends, to keep de\r\nfire a goin, and to hole a watch an a guard ober de party.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think we’d let you do that?” said Bart. “Do you think we’d go to\r\nsleep, and leave you to watch us all night? No. If there’s going to be\r\nany watching, we’ll take turns.”\r\n\r\n“Dat ar am all berry well,” said Solomon, with a dignified wave of\r\nhis hand, “stremely well, an proppa for ordnary casiums; but dis yar\r\ncasium’s a berry strornary casium. Dar’s danger; and de man dat’s\r\ngoin to keep watch mus be able to face de enemy in a fight. Dat ars de\r\nreason, den, why I pose to keep a lookout. I’ll set heah, keep de fire\r\na goin, an you can all sleep safe an sound. Dar’s no use for you to set\r\nup.”\r\n\r\n“But you must sleep,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“O, I’ll wake you up early in de mornin, an hab my sleep den. So now\r\ndon’t talk no more, for I’m a goin to do dat ar, an watch dis bressed\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\nSome further conversation followed, in which the boys insisted on\r\nwatching for a part of the time, at least. They were so urgent, that\r\nSolomon at last had to consent. He insisted, however, that he would\r\nsit up during the first part of the night, as the danger would be most\r\nlikely to take place then, if it took place at all, and promised to wake\r\nthem towards morning. With this understanding the boys lay down by the\r\nfire, and in spite of their recent excitement, they soon fell asleep.\r\n\r\nSolomon sat there by the fire keeping watch with all his senses on the\r\nalert. No danger was there of this faithful old sentinel sleeping at his\r\npost. The very possibility of danger to the boys was enough to keep all\r\nhis mind wakeful and attentive. After a time he moved back a little, and\r\nrested his back against a tree.\r\n\r\nThe hours of the night passed on slowly and tediously. The boys slept\r\nsoundly, and were lost in the land of dreams. Occasionally Solomon\r\namused himself and beguiled the time by going forth and collecting\r\nsticks for the fire. The flames smouldered low, and the sticks that\r\nSolomon was able to gather were not sufficient to kindle them afresh to\r\nany great extent, and so the consequence was, that at length it nearly\r\ndied out. It was profoundly dark; but still Solomon watched, and felt no\r\ninclination to sleep.\r\n\r\nHe had promised to awake the boys towards morning, but they slept so\r\nsoundly that he had not the heart to keep his promise, and so he let\r\nthem sleep on. At length Bart awoke, and, starting up, he looked all\r\naround. It was early morning twilight; the sky was brightening overhead,\r\nand the forms of the forest trees were visible around. As he started,\r\nSolomon got up, and walked towards him.\r\n\r\n“Well, Mas’r Bart,” said he, “all right so far. De Injun gone off\r\nforebbamo.”\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you wake me before?” asked Bart.\r\n\r\n“De gracious sakes, now, chile!” said Solomon; “dar wasn’t no casium.\r\n’Tain’t mornin yet.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you lie down now, and go to sleep,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Solomon; and going back to the tree where he had\r\nbeen sitting, he curled himself up on the moss at the foot of it, and,\r\ndrawing his shawl over his head and shoulders, was soon in a sound\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\nAnd now the morning advanced; slowly the shades of night faded away,\r\nuntil, at length, the day dawned, and a thousand birds awaked the echoes\r\nof the forest in all directions, and filled all the air with a flood\r\nof melody. Bart looked up at the sky, and noticed that it was overcast.\r\nThere was also a very peculiar appearance there which excited his\r\nattention. There seemed clouds overhead; but the clouds had a sickly,\r\nyellowish color, which was unlike anything that he had ever seen. After\r\na short time, Pat and Phil awoke, and Bart drew their attention to this.\r\nThey, however, thought nothing of it.\r\n\r\n“It’s only common clouds,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“Deed, an it’s a good sign, so it is,” said Pat, in his usual tone of\r\nconfidence. “The trout bite wondherful whin they see a sky like that\r\nover thim. It’s lucky for us we’ve got sich weather.”\r\n\r\nBart had his doubts about this, but he kept them to himself, and then\r\nthe boys began to consider what they had better do. The loss of their\r\nIndian guide made a change in their circumstances of a very important\r\nnature. As long as they had him with them, they had no care or anxiety,\r\nfor they knew that he would take them to all the best places in the\r\ncountry. But, now that he had gone, what ought they to do first?\r\n\r\nThe idea of going back occurred, but it was at once dismissed. To go\r\nback would be very fatiguing, and would be of no particular use. For, if\r\nthey did get another guide, he might turn out as badly as the one whom\r\nthey had lost; and besides, their experience with Sam disgusted them\r\nwith guides and with Indians altogether.\r\n\r\n“If I only had a compass,” said Bart, “we’d be all right, for we could\r\nat least be able to choose some direction, and have some idea of where\r\nwe went. But, as it is, we shall have to wander at random.”\r\n\r\n“Sure and that’s the very best way there is to wandhcr, so it is,” said\r\nPat. “It’s a mighty sight better to go sthrollin along as you like than\r\nit is to be taggin afther a big drunken Injin, any day.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Phil, “that’s the best way. Let’s go strolling along,\r\nfishing at every brook we come to, and enjoy ourselves. We can make\r\ncamps, and if we come to any pleasanter place than usual, we can stay\r\nthere for two or three days. Why, this is the very best way of enjoying\r\nourselves. I’m sure I couldn’t imagine anything more glorious.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if there are any fish up that little brook,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Sure an we’d betther try.”\r\n\r\n“One of us had better stay behind with Solomon,” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“I’ll stay,” said Phil; “I’ll get some sticks and build the fire again,\r\nand if you do get any fish, we’ll be able to have some for breakfast.”\r\n\r\nUpon this, Bart and Pat prepared their rods, and lines, and went off up\r\nthe brook. It was not very large, but it had the general appearance of a\r\ngood trouting stream; and the appearance did not deceive them, for after\r\na short time, to their great joy, they succeeded in hooking ten or\r\na dozen very respectable trout, with which they returned to the\r\n“encampment.” Here they found a brisk fire, beside which Phil was\r\nsitting awaiting their return. As they reached the place, Solomon awoke\r\nfrom his nap, and joined them at the fire. Then followed breakfast,\r\nwhich consisted of broiled trout, and, as they had brought plenty of\r\nsalt and pepper in their baskets, there was no lack of relish, and the\r\nfish was pronounced delicious.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, they once more noticed the appearance of the sky. It\r\nhad still that dull, sickly, yellowish hue which had first struck Bart’s\r\nattention. Although the day had advanced since then, the sky had not\r\nchanged, and there was no increase of light.\r\n\r\n“It’s smoke,” said Bart. “I wonder what’s the cause of it.”\r\n\r\n“De woods are burnin,” said Solomon.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if it is anywhere near,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“O, no!” said Bart; “it’s some distant fire or other. Perhaps they’re\r\nclearing land.”\r\n\r\n“Dar’s alius smoke a floatin about d’ese times in de woods,” said\r\nSolomon. “Dey keep a clearin an a choppin--no end.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s all the betther fer us,” said Pat, “for an overcast sky is\r\nthe thing for the throut; an sure they niver know the difference whither\r\nit’s smoke or clouds, so they don’t, an they bite all the same, so they\r\ndo.”\r\n\r\nThey now prepared for the day’s work; but before starting, Bart said\r\nthat they ought to appoint some place of meeting, in case they got\r\nseparated. On discussing this point, however, they soon found that they\r\nwere not in a position to appoint any place of rendezvous, since no one\r\nplace was known to them except where they were sitting. They did not\r\ncare about remaining in the vicinity of this place, but wished to ramble\r\non at leisure, and at liberty.\r\n\r\n“Sure an there’s no nade,” said Pat; “we can all kape widin hearin of\r\none another, so we can.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate,” said Phil, “we can start now, and stay by one another as\r\nlong as possible. If we come to any place where we have to separate, we\r\ncan easily make an arrangement to come back to that place.”\r\n\r\nThis last remark seemed satisfactory, and as it was really the only\r\nthing that they could do, they said no more on the subject, but set\r\nforth at once.\r\n\r\nThey walked on for about an hour, and at length emerged from the pine\r\ntrees, and came to woods where the trees were largely birch and maple.\r\nThus far, their progress had been very easy, as the ground under the\r\npine trees was smooth, and there was very little underbrush. At this\r\nplace, however, it became more difficult. Small trees and underbrush\r\narose on every side in great profusion, and the ground rose in a\r\nsuccession of gentle eminences, while an occasional swamp intervened.\r\nStill, it was not very difficult walking even there, and the chief\r\ndifference was, that their course became much more circuitous. Through\r\nthis they wandered for another hour and more, without finding any place\r\nthat was at all suitable.\r\n\r\nAt length, to their great joy, they found themselves upon the edge of a\r\nsmall rivulet, which was not more than forty or fifty feet in width. Its\r\nbed just here was strewn with pebbles and cobblestones; but farther up\r\nand down, they saw hollows and deeper places in the river-bed, which\r\npromised some sport. Here they prepared for action. Phil and Pat offered\r\nto go down the stream, while Bart and Solomon could go up. Before\r\nparting, it was settled that they should come back to this place. On\r\nthe other side of the stream there were two birch trees growing close\r\ntogether, which would serve as a sufficient landmark to enable them to\r\nrecognize this place on their return; and with this arrangement the two\r\nparties separated, Phil and Pat descending the stream, while Bart and\r\nSolomon went up the channel.\r\n\r\nBart and Solomon went up the river-bed for some distance. They found no\r\ndifficulty in going along, for the stream was shallow, and they could\r\nwade it in most places. Occasionally they came to deeper places, which\r\nthey traversed by going round them. At length they reached a place that\r\nlooked favorable to their designs, and began to try them. A few bites\r\nrewarded them, and two or three small trout were soon deposited in their\r\nbaskets. They now began to enter more into the spirit of the occasion,\r\nand continued slowly ascending the stream, stopping sometimes a long\r\nwhile in some particularly good place, till they had exhausted it, and\r\nthen resuming their tramp. The consequence was, that their baskets soon\r\nbegan to be unpleasantly heavy, and they had to confine themselves\r\nmore exclusively to one spot, and indulge to a less extent in their\r\nwanderings. All this time these two had had no occasion to keep a\r\nlookout on each other, for Solomon, with his instinct of fidelity, had\r\nno other idea than that of simply following Bart wherever he went.\r\n\r\nAll this time the sky had maintained the same yellowish hue, and was as\r\nmuch overcast as ever. Here and there they reached places where the view\r\nupward was more extensive, and their gaze could command a larger part\r\nof the sky. They saw rolling clouds which seemed most unmistakably to be\r\nsmoke, and these they thought the sure indications of some fire,\r\nwhich, judging from these appearances, was larger than usual. Beyond an\r\noccasional glance upward, however, and a stray remark, these appearances\r\nexcited no particular notice on the part of either of them.\r\n\r\nAt length it began to grow somewhat late, and they decided to return.\r\nTheir long march and still longer fishing excursion had greatly fatigued\r\nthem; and in going back, they found the distance far greater than they\r\nhad supposed. At length they recognized the landmark; and here they both\r\nflung themselves wearily down upon the bank, and waited for the return\r\nof the others.\r\n\r\nFor a long time they waited there. It grew later and later, but there\r\nwas no sign of either of them. At length they saw some one coming, and\r\nas he drew nearer they recognized Pat. He was very much out of breath,\r\nand soaking wet from head to foot.\r\n\r\n“Where’s Phil?”\r\n\r\nThose were the first words that Pat spoke, and he spoke them in hurried,\r\nanxious tones.\r\n\r\n“Phil!” cried Bart. “Why, don’t you know?”\r\n\r\n“Hasn’t he got back yit?” said Pat, with something like a wail.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bart, as a dark feeling of apprehension came to him.\r\n\r\n“Och, thin,” cried Pat, “it’s fairly heart-broke I am, so I am; and no\r\none knows what I’ve suffered this blissed day. Sorra one o’ me knows\r\nwhat has become of him. An I’ve been scourin the whole country back’ards\r\nan for’ards, an yellin meself hoarse, so that I can’t utther one blissed\r\nhowl more, so I can’t.”\r\n\r\nAt these startling words, all Pat’s anxiety and more communicated itself\r\nto Bart. He hastily questioned Pat about Phil’s disappearance.\r\n\r\n“We wint down,” said Pat, “for iver so far, an we came to one of the\r\nfoinest holes iver was. We fished there a half hour an more, and thin\r\nPhil says, says he, ‘I’ll go, says he, over beyont,’--for there was a\r\nmoighty big rock jist forninst us. So he wint for to climb the rock, and\r\nhe says, ‘I’m goin furder down,’ says he. So I thought no more about it,\r\nbut wint on wid me fishin. It wasn’t for iver so long that I thought of\r\nhim; but at last I begins to fail anxious, and wondhers to meself what\r\niver have become of him. So I started off. I didn’t climb over the big\r\nrock, as he did, but crossed the sthraim and wint down the other side.\r\nWell, I couldn’t see a sign of him. I called, an yelled, an howled, an\r\nwalked iver so far down an back agin; an that same I’ve been doin iver\r\nsince, till I thought, at last, he might have somehow got back here. An\r\nhe ain’t here.”\r\n\r\nThis story caused terrible anxiety. Bart at once started down the\r\nstream, and reached a high, rocky bank covered with trees. He stood\r\nhere and called. It was now too dark to see much. His calls awaked no\r\nresponse. He then returned, full of the most anxious fears, with a faint\r\nhope that he might find Phil on his return.\r\n\r\nBut on his return there was no Phil to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n_The Loss of Phil.--Deep Gloom and heavy Grief.--A Night of Terror.--The\r\ntorrid Atmosphere.----The Smell of Smoke.--The Darkness that might be\r\nfelt.--Morning brings Relief.--The Search.--The Rock and the Precipice\r\nby the River-side.--The Track of Phil.--Following the Trail.--The Trail\r\nlost.--Persevering Search.--The End of the Day._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE loss of Phil produced a terrible effect upon the little party.\r\nPat’s grief was expressed by sighs and groans for some time, until at\r\nlength his elastic nature rebounded from its depression, and he began to\r\nhope for the best. Solomon was deeply distressed, and said not a word;\r\nwhile Bart was also silent, and he tried in vain to conjecture what\r\nhad been the cause of Phil’s departure. To him it seemed perfectly\r\nunaccountable how he could have got lost. There was the stream, and it\r\nseemed to be easy enough, even if one had wandered from it, to retrace\r\nhis steps. From Pat’s story, Phil’s departure from him by that rock was\r\nthe beginning of misfortunes. At some time after that he must have begun\r\nto wander in a wrong direction, and gradually gone farther and farther\r\naway till he was lost.\r\n\r\nAll that night none of them slept. For a time they kept up a series of\r\ncries, which awakened no response. Then they built a fire, thinking that\r\nthe glow would penetrate to a distance beyond where their cries could\r\ngo. They made the fire on the bank, and kept it up for two or three\r\nhours; but at length they could find no more fuel, and allowed it to die\r\nout.\r\n\r\nWhile thus watching and using these efforts to make known their\r\nsituation to the wanderer, their excitement and suspense were too great\r\nto allow of any thought of sleep. Eyes and ears were constantly on the\r\nstretch, and every sound, however faint, awakened within them the hope\r\nthat it might be Phil. But the hours passed on, and not a single sign\r\nappeared to them as they watched, and listened, and waited.\r\n\r\n“I wonder whether he is wandering about in this darkness or not,” said\r\nBart, in an anxious-voice. “But I don’t suppose it is possible for any\r\none to walk in these woods now.”\r\n\r\n“Niver a walk,” said Pat; “not he. He’s tin times comfortabler thin we\r\nare. He’s jist gathered some moss, an he’s made a comfortable bed for\r\nhimself over beyont, somewheres under thim trays. Deed an he has. An\r\nwhat’s more, he’s asleep now, sound as a top, so he is; an I wish\r\nI wor as sound aslape as he is this blissed momint.”\r\n\r\nBart shook his head mournfully.\r\n\r\n“No,” said he, with a sigh, “he won’t have much sleep to-night, poor old\r\nPhil; he’s got too much to think of. If he had some one with him, he’d\r\nfeel all right; but it’s a terrible thing to be all alone this way.\r\nAnd it’s a miserable night; so horribly dark; so hot. I can scarcely\r\nbreathe. I never knew such a night.”\r\n\r\n“Thrue for you,” said Pat. “It’s fairly suffocated I am. But at any\r\nrate, that makes no differ to Phil. Sure its betther for him to be too\r\nwarrum thin too cowld, so it is.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t understand it,” said Bart, after a pause. “I don’t see why he\r\nshould be lost. I wonder whether--but that’s nonsense.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“I wonder whether Sam could have been following us,” said Bart, half\r\nshuddering at the frightful thought that had occurred.\r\n\r\n“Sam? What, the Injin?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“An what’d he be a follerin of us for?”\r\n\r\n“O, I don’t know. But you remember how he looked last night. He looked\r\nlike a demon. He certainly tried to kill us.”\r\n\r\n“Sure but he was dead dhrunk an mad intoirely, so he was.”\r\n\r\n“But his mad fit may have lasted till to-day; and he may have been\r\nsneaking after us through the woods, and watching for a chance to do\r\nsome mischief. And so--”\r\n\r\nBart hesitated.\r\n\r\nPat was silent for a few moments.\r\n\r\n“O, sure,” said he at last, “what are ye givin way for to sich mad\r\ndeludherin notions? What’d he be wantin of a boy like Phil?”\r\n\r\n“He might have vowed vengeance on us.”\r\n\r\n“Yingince is it? By the powers, thin, if it’s vingince he wanted, it ud\r\nbe Solomon that he’d track, not Phil, that niver so much as spoke\r\none word to him, good or bad, all the time he was with us. And as for\r\nvingince, sure my iday is, that the Injin’d give up all the vingince\r\nthat ivir wor for a glass o’ whiskey, so he wud.”\r\n\r\nBart made no reply. The subject was too terrible to be discussed. He\r\ntried to dismiss the thought from his mind. But the idea, having once\r\nsuggested itself, was not to be got rid of so easily. Do what he could,\r\nit came back to him over and over again, taking possession of his mind\r\nmore and more strongly.\r\n\r\nA terrible thought it indeed was that had thus come to him--the idea of\r\nthat demoniac being who had sprung at them on the previous night, and\r\nhad only been repelled by what seemed almost a miracle, being still\r\nanimated by furious hate and a thirst for vengeance,--the idea of this\r\nimplacable savage, thirsting for their blood, following stealthily\r\non their trail all that day, maintaining his pursuit with that\r\ninexhaustible patience and tenacity of purpose which a bloodthirsty\r\nsavage alone can show when on the search for vengeance. Had he indeed\r\ndone this? Had this been the secret history of that day? Was this\r\nblood-hound indeed on their track? Could it have been possible that he\r\nhad devoted them one by one to destruction, and had bided his time,\r\nand had made Phil his first victim the moment he wandered away from the\r\nothers? It was a horrible, a sickening thought.\r\n\r\nNow, Bart’s mind was full of stories of Indian warfare and Indian\r\nvengeance, accumulated during a course of reading in Cooper’s\r\nLeatherstocking series, and kindred works; and so it is no wonder that\r\nthis idea came to him. Besides, he had yet fresh and vivid in his mind\r\nthe assault of that drunken fiend the night before. All these things\r\ncombined to fix this fearful idea in his mind. As the hours passed on\r\nit became more deeply seated, until at length he was in an indescribable\r\nstate of anxiety and alarm.\r\n\r\nThus the hours of that night passed away--a night even worse than the\r\npreceding one; for then the terror had come and gone; but now it hung\r\nover them all the time. In addition to this, the night itself was most\r\ndepressing. It was intensely dark. After the fire had died out, it was\r\nimpossible to see anything whatever--not even the hand before the face.\r\nThe deepest shadows surrounded them on all sides, and wherever they\r\nlooked their eyes encountered nothing but the blackness of darkness.\r\nBesides this, it was exceedingly hot and sultry, the air having a\r\ncertain indescribable oppressiveness which made them sometimes fairly\r\ngasp for breath. The only relief that they were able to gain was by\r\nmaking frequent applications to the water of the river, sometimes\r\ndashing it over their faces, at other times dipping in their heads, or\r\nfeet. This sultriness oppressed them all in an equal degree, and united\r\nwith the intense darkness to throw them into a state of bewilderment\r\nand perplexity. Taken in connection with Phil’s disappearance and the\r\nterrible event of the preceding night, it produced such an effect upon\r\nthe mind of Bart, that all the fears which were suggested by his vivid\r\nfancy became more formidable and irresistible. Solomon said nothing at\r\nall, but appeared to be quite overwhelmed. Pat alone struggled against\r\nthe evil influences of the time, and endeavored most energetically to\r\nput the best appearance on things, and to rouse Bart from the deep gloom\r\ninto which he had fallen. So the night passed; and it was at length with\r\na feeling of immense relief that they saw the darkness begin to lessen.\r\n\r\nAs the day dawned, a faint breeze sprang up, which brought a gentle,\r\ncooling influence with it. They rose and inhaled with long breaths the\r\nmore grateful air. Gradually the darkness disappeared, and the daylight\r\nincreased, and the forms of things around them became revealed.\r\n\r\nOverhead there was no change from the day before. The sky was all\r\ncovered over with dense clouds, which seemed to hang much lower down\r\nthan on the preceding day, and now appeared whirling round and rolling\r\nover the heavens in vast vortices. This movement on their part was, no\r\ndoubt, caused by their encountering the breeze which had sprung up,\r\nand which, meeting them now in their course, arrested that course, and\r\nwhirled them back in confused heaps.\r\n\r\nAnd now a new day lay before them, in which they would have to employ\r\nevery hour in the search after Phil. What that day or that search might\r\nbring forward, they could not tell; but they were eager to begin it\r\nas soon as possible. While it was yet morning twilight, they ate their\r\nbreakfast, and discussed the best plan of procedure. Solomon, as usual,\r\nmade no remark upon the subject, being content to abide by Bart’s\r\ndecision, while Bart and Pat talked over various ways of carrying on\r\ntheir search. To separate was not to be thought of, for that would only\r\nlead to fresh troubles. So it was decided, that wherever they went, they\r\nshould now keep together. They further decided that they should go down\r\nthe stream till they reached that rock already spoken of, which had been\r\nthe point of Phil’s departure, and try if they could not get upon his\r\ntrail, so as to see, at least in a general way, what direction he had\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nDuring this deliberation about the course which they should take, Bart\r\nstill exhibited the despondency which had characterized him ever since\r\nPhil’s disappearance. The gloom of night and the oppressive sultriness\r\nhad passed, daylight was at hand, and the breeze brought fresh life to\r\nthem; but still Bart’s spirits were deeply depressed. Against this Pat\r\nrebelled, and the cheerfulness and confidence which he had tried to\r\nmaintain through the night now assumed a prominent place in his thoughts\r\nand in his manner.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bart, dolefully, continuing some remark which he had been\r\nmaking, “if we can only get on his trail, we may at least find out the\r\ngeneral direction that he has taken. But I’m afraid there’s no hope.”\r\n\r\n“Arrah, be off now wid yer nonsinse,” cried Pat. “What’s the use of\r\ngivin up at the very fust, afore ye’ve made a single trial? Sure an\r\nhe’ll turrun up all right and safe yit.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I could think so.”\r\n\r\n“Think so! Why, I know it. Sure am I this day that he’ll turrun up safe\r\nan sound. An why shouldn’t he?”\r\n\r\n“These woods. If he once gets tangled among them, how can he ever find\r\nhis way out?”\r\n\r\n“Tangled among them, is it? Sure an it’s not so very bad thin. He can\r\nonly walk on an walk on; an he’s sure to come out somewheres. Besides,\r\nhe’ll hit upon a road some place or other, and wander along that.”\r\n\r\n“There are no roads here.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know? Ye don’t know. Thur may be fifty roads widin a mile of\r\nthis very place, so there may. So what’s the use of givin up?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bart. “This is a wild, unfrequented place, and the woods are\r\nunbroken for an immense distance. If Phil has got among them he will\r\nwander on till--till he drops.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, come now, none of that. Sure, what do ye think of Phil? Do ye think\r\nnow that Phil’s an idiot? Sure now, what’d ye do yerself if it was you\r\nthat was lost instead of Phil? Do you think that you’d wandher about\r\ntill you dropped, or do ye think ye’d work yer way out somewheres? Come\r\nnow, ye know ye’d work yer way out, so you would. And so would I. And so\r\nwill Phil, so he will.”\r\n\r\nThis process of reasoning struck Bart so forcibly that he had not a word\r\nto say. Pat in fact was right in his estimate of Bart’s confidence in\r\nhimself. Bart really did feel sure that if he were lost in the woods\r\nhe’d get out.\r\n\r\n“Sure now imagine yerself in Phil’s place,” continued Pat, cheerily.\r\n“What’d you do? I’ll tell you what you’d do. Whin ye found yerself lost,\r\nye’d thry, of coorse, to git back. Well, thin, ye’d go wandherin about.\r\nVery well. Ye’d sit down an rist, and think what ye’d best do nixt.\r\nThen ye’d start off afrish. Maybe ye’d climb a tray to see if ye cud see\r\nanythin. At any rate ye’d work away as long as the daylight lasted. At\r\nsteeted intervals ye’d let off howls as loud as ye cud howl. Well, thin,\r\nit’ud grow dark, an so ye’d go to work an make up your mind to pass the\r\nnight here, an ye’d thry, of coorse, to make yerself as comfortable as\r\npossible. So ye’d collect any quantity of moss an ferns, an spread\r\nthem out--perhaps ye’d make a fire--but that’s neither here nor there;\r\nanyhow, ye’d make a comfortable bid for yerself, an thin ye’d take a\r\nbite of somethin to ate, and thin ye’d lie doun an doze off into the\r\ncomfortablest slape ye ever knew. That’s what ye’d do--an ye know it, so\r\nye do. Now wouldn’t ye? Answer me that. Isn’t that jist what ye wud do?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I suppose I would,” said Bart; “but perhaps the Indian has had\r\nsomething to do.”\r\n\r\n“The Injin. O, bah! Bother the Injin. That does to spake of in the\r\nmiddle of a dark night, but not undher the bright daylight. That Injin’s\r\nsafe in his own camp by noo, I’ll warrant ye.”\r\n\r\nBy this time they were ready to start, and accordingly they set out\r\non their way down the stream to the rock already mentioned. It was not\r\nquite day when they started, but by the time they reached the rock it\r\nwas full day, so that they would be able to detect any trace of Phil’s\r\npathway if any such trace might remain. The rock was about thirty or\r\nforty feet high, and rose upon the edge of the river which flowed along\r\nits base. Phil might have crossed the river, and gone down, as Pat did,\r\non the other side; but he chose this, probably thinking that it was only\r\na few steps. On reaching this place Pat was able to point out pretty\r\nnearly the spot where he saw Phil mount the bank. Here the underbrush\r\nseemed to show signs of having been trampled upon, and they at once\r\nascended the bank in this direction. For some distance the marks\r\ncontinued, and they followed very carefully. At last, shortly after they\r\nreached the top of the bank, these faint marks died out utterly, and\r\nthere remained no trace whatever of any footsteps that was discernible\r\nto their eyes. Here, then, they paused, and again considered what they\r\nshould do.\r\n\r\nAfter careful consideration of everything, it seemed to them that\r\nthe best thing for them now to do was to advance from the river bank\r\ndirectly into the woods in as straight a line as possible. If they were\r\nto do this for several miles, they might get upon the wanderer’s track.\r\nThey therefore set out, walking away from the river, trying by every\r\npossible means to make their course a straight line. They also tore off\r\ntwigs from the trees as they went and strewed them behind them to leave\r\na trail. Thus they went for about half an hour. Then they began to\r\nshout, and still going onward for another half hour, they continued\r\ntheir shouts. But at the end of this time and these efforts they were no\r\nbetter off than at the beginning, and to all their cries there came no\r\nresponse whatever.\r\n\r\nHere another discussion took place. It seemed to Pat that Phil must have\r\nwandered down the stream, how far he did not know, but perhaps miles,\r\nand that on his return he had left the river at some point, and thus\r\nbeen lost. If this were so, it followed that the best place to search\r\nfor him would be the woods lying on a line with the river, and extending\r\nalong its banks. If they were now to turn to the right, they would be\r\ngoing in a course parallel to the river, and through those very woods\r\nin which it was most likely that Phil might be. Pat’s statement and\r\nargument seemed so reasonable that Bart at once adopted it; and so, with\r\nthe utmost care, they took up a course which seemed as near as possible\r\nat right angles with their former one, and consequently as nearly as\r\npossible parallel with the flow of the river. In this direction they now\r\nwent, trying as before to keep a straight course, and to leave a trail\r\nbehind them. Above all, they kept shouting and calling all the time.\r\n\r\nThey went on in this course for as much as two hours with no more\r\nsuccess than before. They came to woods where the underbrush was so\r\nthick, and the ground so swampy, that further progress was out of the\r\nquestion. Here, then, they once more deliberated as to what they should\r\ndo. To go back seemed inexpressibly irksome, as well as useless. It\r\nseemed better to change their course in some new direction, which might\r\nbe favorable to their hopes. On the whole it now seemed best to get\r\nback to the river. Phil might be there somewhere along its banks. In the\r\nevening they could go back to their former stopping-place by ascending\r\nthe course of the river. So they took up a new line of march, which\r\nseemed to be exactly at right angles with their last one, and thus went\r\non.\r\n\r\nAll this time they had been taking the utmost pains to leave a trail;\r\nbut now, as they were going back to the river, it seemed no longer\r\nnecessary: so they walked along much more easily and quickly, merely\r\ntrying to make their pathway as straight as possible.\r\n\r\nThey walked on for a long time.\r\n\r\nThe river seemed much more distant than they had supposed.\r\n\r\nStill they cheered themselves with the thought, at almost every step,\r\nthat the next step would bring them in sight of it.\r\n\r\nOne more pause.\r\n\r\nStill the river did not appear.\r\n\r\nAnother hour passed.\r\n\r\nStill no river.\r\n\r\nNevertheless they toiled on, for having set before themselves this river\r\nas a certain place to be reached, they were not willing to stop short of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut the farther they went, the more hopeless did their attempt seem.\r\n\r\nAt length there began to come over them a vague idea that they had lost\r\nall idea of the direction of the river--that they had been wandering\r\nin a wrong direction altogether; and this vague idea grew stronger and\r\nstronger, and began to grow into a full conviction that they, as well as\r\nPhil, were utterly and hopelessly lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n_Lost--Deliberations.--Trying to regain the Course.--The Smoke of the\r\nBurning.--The stagnant Air.--Onward.--An Opening in the Forest.--Hope\r\nand Enthusiasm.--A Rush forward._\r\n\r\n\r\nLOST!\r\n\r\nYes, Lost!\r\n\r\nLost in the woods!\r\n\r\nIt was Bart who first received this idea in its full force in his mind.\r\nHe stopped abruptly, and looked all around.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, “it’s my opinion that we’ve been keeping this sort of\r\nthing up too long altogether. For my part, I haven’t the faintest idea\r\nin the world where we are. One thing is certain: we’re utterly astray in\r\nwhat we may suppose to be our reckoning; and wherever the river may be,\r\nit certainly isn’t anywhere near us. And I’m going to knock under for\r\nthe present.”\r\n\r\nWith these words, he flung himself down upon a knoll under a neighboring\r\ntree, threw off his bag, and pitched it away to some distance from him,\r\nand then, drawing his knees up under his chin, he sat gazing fixedly at\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Pat, “I’ve been thinkin that same for the last hour, sure;\r\nbut, as ye seemed inclined to laid off, an as I hadn’t anythin more to\r\noffer, why, I jist follered afther. An sure I think it ain’t a bad idea\r\nat all, at all, to sit down, if it’s only to rist ourselves, an take\r\na bite of somethin to ate, an thry to git up some schame for our nixt\r\nattimpt.”\r\n\r\nWith these words, Pat took a seat upon the ground, and Solomon, without\r\nany remark, sat down near them.\r\n\r\nAnd there they all sat, silent, with the same thought in all their\r\nminds; and that was, that they were utterly, completely, and hopelessly\r\nlost in the woods. None of them felt inclined to speak. They felt\r\ndiscomfited, disheartened, mortified. So this was the end of their\r\nelaborate plans, so carefully discussed, so carefully followed--that\r\nthey who came to seek their lost friend should themselves be lost also!\r\nThey were confident that they had made some mistake somewhere, and at\r\nsome time, and they were now busily engaged in recalling the different\r\nevents of their journey, so as to see where and when the mistake had\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nBart thought that their mistake was in not continuing to leave a trail\r\nbehind them, after they had made the last change in their course. Up to\r\nthat time, it seemed to him that all had gone on well, and he lamented\r\nthat fatal carelessness and over-confidence that had led to this\r\nneglect.\r\n\r\nPat’s idea was, that they had not calculated the direction of the river,\r\nand that they had somehow missed it.\r\n\r\nSolomon declared that, ever since he left the river, he hadn’t had any\r\nidea at all of any direction.\r\n\r\n“Dat’s so,” he said; “I heerd you go on in dem ar long-winded\r\n’scussions bout right Sections, an poppumdiklars, an rytanglums, an\r\nsich, but hadn’t no more notium ob whar we was goin dan a chile. An you\r\nhadn’t nudder. Yah! yah! yah!”\r\n\r\nSolomon’s idea was, after all, much nearer the truth than the theories\r\nof either Bart or Pat. For although these two had supposed all the time\r\nthat they were carrying in their very clever brains a perfectly\r\ndistinct plan of their course, yet, in reality, this belief was utterly\r\nunfounded, and the supposed plan was a mockery, a delusion, and a snare.\r\nHere they were--lost!--that was the end of it.\r\n\r\nFor, in point of fact, their whole journey had been one constant series\r\nof mistakes. From the first step to the last, there had been nothing but\r\nself-delusion.\r\n\r\nFirst, they had deluded themselves into the belief that they could\r\ngo in a straight line. Now, in those woods, there had been incessant\r\nobstacles, in the shape of clumps of trees, underbrush, bogs, rocks,\r\nfallen timber, and a hundred other things of a similar character, which\r\nnecessitated a departure from a straight line at every few steps. To\r\nsuppose that they could walk on, under such circumstances, in a straight\r\nline, was absurd. The consequence was, that their course had, all along,\r\nbeen exceedingly crooked, leading them towards all the points of the\r\ncompass in turns.\r\n\r\nAnother mistake which they made was, in the supposition that the river\r\nhad any definite course. They had acted on the theory, not only that\r\ntheir own course was straight, but that the course of the river was\r\nstraight also. Now, this river, like every other river, had a flow in\r\none general direction, but its actual course was a winding one, and not\r\nfar below the rock from which they had set out, it turned in a direction\r\nwhich was totally different from the one in which it was flowing when\r\nthey left it.\r\n\r\nThus they had been wandering in a very irregular course ever since they\r\nstarted. They had gone onward for mile after mile, and every step\r\nhad carried them farther and farther away from the places in the\r\nneighborhood of which they wished to remain, and now, at this bewildered\r\nhalt, they were in reality far, very far, away from that river which\r\nthey had believed themselves to be approaching.\r\n\r\nSome such conviction as this came to their minds now,--that is to say,\r\nthe conviction that they had wandered far away from the river,--but\r\nthey had no idea how far away from it they really were, and they\r\nthought--that is to say, Bart and Pat thought--that their wanderings had\r\nbegun only at their last change of course, near the wooded swamp.\r\n\r\nThus far, the weather had been warm, but not so sultry as on the day\r\nbefore. The air appeared to have become cooled by that gentle breeze\r\nwhich had sprung up in the morning. The sky, however, had been overcast\r\nas before, and all the view overhead was covered with those rolling\r\nsmoke clouds before mentioned. They noticed this now as they sat there,\r\nand it seemed to them that the sky was more enveloped with this sombre\r\ncovering, and that the light was dimmer, and the scene more gloomy. The\r\nbirds also seemed to have all fled away from that smoky sky.\r\n\r\nTheir long tramp had sharpened their appetites, and they now began to\r\nthink of lunch. Fortunately, Solomon, with his usual forethought, had\r\nsaved the fish that had been left from their repast on the previous\r\nday, and these, with some sandwiches, furnished out a meal. They\r\nwere without anything to drink, however; but a little search in the\r\nneighborhood revealed a slender rill of very warm water, which, warm\r\nas it was, they were glad to drink. On the whole, this frugal repast\r\nrefreshed them and invigorated them; and after its conclusion, they\r\nbegan to consider once more the important question of the course which\r\nthey should take next.\r\n\r\nWhat perplexed them most was the impossibility of knowing anything about\r\nthe direction in which they ought to go. The points of the compass were\r\nall unknown. North, south, east, and west were all alike a mystery.\r\nThe smoke clouds that covered the whole sky made it impossible even to\r\nconjecture, with any approach to accuracy, the possible position of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nTheir situation was perplexing in the extreme. In fact, it was a double\r\nperplexity. They did not know where Phil was, and they did not know\r\nwhere they themselves were. They wanted to find Phil; but by reason of\r\ntheir loss of all knowledge of locality, they were unable to form even\r\na theory of the particular direction in which it might be best to\r\nrenew their search after him. And this it was that made any discussion\r\nparticularly difficult.\r\n\r\nThen, again, though they had a distinct remembrance of the river\r\nitself, yet they had formed no definite idea about its course. Bart\r\nthought it ran north. Pat thought it ran south. Why they thought so,\r\nneither could give any reason. But this mattered nothing now. Even if\r\nthey had known most perfectly the actual course of the river,--nay,\r\neven if they had been perfectly acquainted with the geography of the\r\ndistrict,--it would have availed them nothing whatever in their present\r\nposition, nor could they have been in any better position to decide\r\nabout the best direction which they could take.\r\n\r\n“We ought to be moving,” said Bart; “but where? I’m sure I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Well, thin,” said Pat, “I’ll tell you what it is. Let’s be off,\r\nand thrust to luck. Let’s walk ahead anywheres, and we’ll come out\r\nsomewheres.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t we tell something by the clouds?” asked Bart, looking up at the\r\nrolling masses overhead.\r\n\r\n“Deed an I’ve thought o’ that,” said Pat, “an I’ve been watchin thim;\r\nbut sorra one o’ me can make out any thin about thim same at all, at\r\nall. They’re jist rowlin an tumblin every which way. An that same they\r\nwere doin this mornin; for I watched thim, an cudn’t make any thin out\r\no’ thim at all, at all, no more’n I can now at this blissed momint. An\r\nthey won’t be afther tellin you any more’n they towld me, I’ll go bail.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said Bart, “that they are moving in some direction.\r\nI remember noticing this morning that they moved, or seemed to move,\r\nacross the river. Now, if the river ran north--”\r\n\r\n“South,” interrupted Pat.\r\n\r\n“North,” persisted Bart. “If it ran north, why, these clouds must be\r\nmoving east.”\r\n\r\n“West,” cried Pat.\r\n\r\n“East,” persisted Bart. “If I’m certain of anything, I’m certain that\r\nthey must be going east.”\r\n\r\n“Deed an I’m dead sure that they’re a goin west.\r\n\r\n“An I’m as likely to be right as you are.”\r\n\r\n“O, well,” said Bart, “we can’t come to any decision at all.”\r\n\r\n“Surely no; not from thim clouds,” said Pat. “For afther all, I don’t\r\nthink they’re movin anywheres. They’re jist rowlin round and round.\r\nNiver mind thim clouds.”\r\n\r\n“But we must go somewhere,” said Bart, impatiently.\r\n\r\n“Deed an so we must; an so I say.”\r\n\r\n“Then where shall we go?”\r\n\r\n“Jist wheriver you say. You laid ahead, an I’ll toiler till the\r\nwurruld’s ind, so I will, an that’s all about it.”\r\n\r\nBart now rose, and so did the others; and after a little natural\r\nhesitation, they all set out once more upon their journey.\r\n\r\nThis journey was thus resumed on the principle that it was better to be\r\nmoving than to sit idle. Something had to be done, but what it was they\r\ndid not know. Bart had formed some vague idea of his general direction\r\nfrom the clouds, and was trying now to find his way back to the\r\nneighborhood at least of the place from which they had set out. At any\r\nrate, he thought he would thus be more likely to come upon Phil’s\r\ntrack, for this was still the idea that was uppermost in his mind. The\r\ndirection in which that place lay seemed to him to be west; and so, with\r\nthis thought in his mind, he set out and led the way.\r\n\r\nOf course, Bart’s idea about going west was of the vaguest possible\r\ndescription. Bart’s west was Pat’s east; and each of them was equally\r\nlikely to be wrong. For it might have been either north or south; and\r\nin addition to this, there was the fact of their circuitous march, which\r\nset straight lines at defiance, and bore them along in a winding course,\r\nthat might lead to every point of the compass in turn. However, there\r\nwas actually no other course possible, and Bart and Pat were both\r\nsatisfied; for while Bart thought he was following the course which\r\nseemed to him best, Pat thought that they were going in no particular\r\ndirection at all, but were wandering at random. Of the two, Pat was far\r\nmore in the right. As to Solomon, it was a matter of indifference to\r\nhim, so long as Bart led the way, and so long as the aim of their march\r\nwas a search after Phil.\r\n\r\nThey walked on now in silence for some hours. The woods were just the\r\nsame as they had been all along. Sometimes they came to a wide extent of\r\npine trees, where the walking was easy, and they were able to maintain\r\nsome definite direction. At other times they came to woods filled\r\nwith hard-wood trees, where the underbrush was thick and the obstacles\r\nnumerous. Here they were compelled to wind along in a circuitous way,\r\nmaking numerous detours to avoid dense thickets or impassable bogs.\r\n\r\nAt length the evening drew on, and all of them were nearly worn out.\r\nIt had been a long and a difficult march. They had exerted themselves\r\nseverely all that day. Besides, it was not a time that was favorable to\r\nsevere exertion, for the warmth of the atmosphere affected them all. As\r\nthe evening approached the warmth increased, for the slight breeze that\r\nhad been prevailing all the day, and mitigating the sultriness of the\r\nweather, now died out, and at once that same oppressiveness of which\r\nthey had been aware on the preceding day made itself manifest again.\r\nExertion became more and more painful. Their progress became more and\r\nmore laborious, and they walked with ever-increasing difficulty. At\r\nlength Bart stopped.\r\n\r\n“I won’t go any farther,” said he. “This isn’t much of a place to pass\r\nthe night in, but I’ve been on the lookout for the last hour, and this\r\nis as good as any that I’ve seen. We can’t do any more to-day. So I move\r\nthat we stop here and rest, and settle down for the night.”\r\n\r\nTo this the others agreed; and so, flinging down their baskets, they\r\nbegan to make preparations for the night. The preparations were simple\r\nenough, consisting in nothing more than a collection of moss and fern\r\nleaves, which abounded all around, and of which they soon heaped up\r\na quantity sufficient for their wants. After this they sat down and\r\npartook of an evening repast from their rapidly diminishing stock of\r\nsandwiches.\r\n\r\n“By the powers,” said Pat, “if we’re in the wuds much longer, we’ll have\r\nto git howld of a stock of frish provisions, so we will.”\r\n\r\nThat night they all slept soundly, for they were worn out by their long\r\nsleeplessness and by the fatigues of their weary march. In that march\r\nthey must have traversed many miles, for they had been walking from\r\nvery early morning till dusk, with only one intermission. Their sleep,\r\ntherefore, was deep and heavy, and it lasted until comparatively late in\r\nthe following day.\r\n\r\nOn awaking they found the air oppressively close and sultry. The smoke\r\nclouds were nearer, and appeared to touch the tree-tops. There was also\r\nan unpleasant smell of smoke which irritated their nostrils and dried up\r\ntheir throats. One thing only was evident from this, and that was, that\r\nthe woods were on fire. It also seemed equally evident that they were\r\napproaching the scene of conflagration. It was already very oppressive,\r\nand how much longer they would be able to maintain their journey was\r\na matter of doubt. Yet there was no desire to give up. The one thought\r\npresent to all of them was, that Phil was lost; and the rolling smoke\r\nclouds now suggested to their minds a danger impending over him of which\r\nthey had not thought before. Thus far Bart had been more or less subject\r\nto fears about the Indian’s being concerned with Phil’s disappearance;\r\nbut now, as these natural terrors were revealed, his thoughts of the\r\nIndian gave place to others of the most painful and harassing character.\r\nFor if Phil was really lost, it amounted to this--that he was wandering\r\nabout in a burning forest, far from all hope of human aid. They\r\nthemselves had suffered, and were suffering, enough to know well what\r\nhis state must be. The lively imagination of Bart portrayed before his\r\nmind in vivid colors the situation of poor Phil, all alone, wandering\r\nhelpless and despairing, surrounded by smoke and flames, oppressed by\r\nthe heat, and sinking under the weight of his anxiety and fatigue. His\r\nlittle store of provisions must soon fail--he would not dare to stop to\r\ntry to catch fish; he would hurry on as long as strength lasted, seeking\r\nto escape from the advancing fires. At last all strength and all hope\r\nwould fail, and a terrific fate would seize upon him.\r\n\r\nThe others had something of the same feelings about Phil, although less\r\nvividly, and were ready to keep up the search after him as long as they\r\ncould move. So they snatched a hasty breakfast, and at once prepared\r\nfor the day’s march. That breakfast exhausted the last of their stock\r\nof provisions, and they could only hope to reach some brook where they\r\nmight catch a few fish. At that moment, however, their thoughts about\r\nthemselves were disregarded in their anxieties about Phil; and so they\r\nset out full of eager desire to find him before it might be too late.\r\n\r\nThus far they had continued to shout at certain intervals, and the last\r\nthing on the preceding night, and the first thing on this morning, had\r\nbeen a series of loud calls. But the calls had never been answered, and\r\nPhil seemed still to be as far away from them as when they first set\r\nout. Still it was the only thing that they could do; and so, as they\r\nwent forward on this day, they kept up, as before, their practice of\r\ncalling at certain intervals of time.\r\n\r\nThey wandered on for hour after hour. The air continued close and\r\nsultry, and the smoke was most unpleasantly perceptible; but this,\r\ninstead of deterring them, only nerved them to fresh efforts, since\r\nit never ceased to suggest to them the thought of poor Phil’s terrible\r\nsituation. One thing consoled them; and that was, the discovery that the\r\nsultriness and the smoke had grown no worse since they started, but if\r\nanything had rather lessened. This they were glad of on Phil’s account;\r\nas for themselves, however, it was certainly bad enough, and as the\r\nhours passed, their efforts became more and more difficult, and their\r\nlabors more overpowering.\r\n\r\nAt last the woods in front of them grew thinner, and through the trees\r\nthey were able to see more and more of the sky. To emerge from the thick\r\nwoods into any open place whatever was a pleasant thought to all of\r\nthem. They wondered what it could be. Solomon thought that it was some\r\nbarren district bare of trees, and overgrown with low brush, such as\r\nsometimes occurs in the forest. Pat thought it was a lake, or a river,\r\nor a swamp, or something of that sort. Bart expected to find a clearing\r\nin the woods, and his heart beat last with joy at the idea of finding\r\nsome human being who could tell them where they where. With these\r\nvarious thoughts and feelings they hurried forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n_The Opening.--The Sea, the Sea, the open Sea.--The Priest.--The Promise\r\nof Help.--Pat takes a Walk, and passes a mysterious Building.--He takes\r\na Swim.--Return of Pat.--A terrific Discovery.--Pat in a Panic.--The\r\nScene of Horror.--Smoke and Flame.--The Fire Glow by Night._\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was late in the afternoon when they reached that opening in the\r\nwoods which had suddenly appeared. They had been fearfully exhausted;\r\nthey had also been almost famished, and were without any prospect of\r\neither rest or food, when that opening appeared before them. But the\r\nsight of it acted upon them like magic, and seemed to drive away both\r\nhunger and weariness. Instantly their pace quickened from a languid,\r\nlaborious walk to a trot, and then to a run, as they hurried forward,\r\neager to learn what this place might be. Bart, with his hope of finding\r\na settlement with living human beings, from whom he might receive\r\ninformation and assistance, was most excited, and was the first to\r\nquicken his pace; and the sight of his excited eagerness affected his\r\ncompanions with the same feelings. Thus they rushed forward, and in a\r\nshort time emerged from the woods.\r\n\r\nAn open field lay before them, in which stumps arose here and there. The\r\nfield rose with a slight ascent to an elevation which shut out the scene\r\nbeyond. It was not the “Barrens,” which Solomon had expected, nor yet\r\nthe lake or swamp which Pat had mentioned. Bart had been right. It was a\r\nspace cleared by the hand of man; but still the question remained,\r\nwhat kind of a settlement was it, and of what extent. For a moment they\r\npaused as they emerged from the wood, and then they all hurried rapidly\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nAs they hurried forward the prospect opened more and more, until they\r\ngained the eminence; and then what a scene lay before them!\r\n\r\nThere, full before them--there, to their speechless\r\namazement--lay--what? Could it be possible. Did their eyes deceive them.\r\nNo. It was a fact. Yet, how amazing!\r\n\r\nThe sea!\r\n\r\nThe wide and boundless sea!\r\n\r\nYes, there it was, beyond the possibility of doubt--the sea--the sea\r\nitself--no river--no lake--but the sea, and nothing else.\r\n\r\nOverhead the smoke clouds still rolled, as before, in vast voluminous\r\nfolds, curling, and turning, and rolling, and lowering down close to the\r\nearth, giving to all nature a gloom that was peculiar, and not without\r\nterror. But beyond this lay the sea; and it stretched far away to the\r\nhorizon, reaching along that horizon to the right and to the left as far\r\nas the eye could wander. It was the sea, the sea itself; and they had\r\nwandered far from the place from which they had set out, to reach such a\r\ngoal as this.\r\n\r\nAnd what was the place?\r\n\r\nIt was a settlement on the sea-shore. Between them and that sea-shore\r\nthere extended cultivated fields, and numerous houses dotted the green\r\nmeadows, and groves, and out-houses, and barns. Farther away, and nearer\r\nthe sea, they noticed a long, low, white building, that looked like a\r\nstraggling farm-house, or rather two or three farmhouses joined in one.\r\nSome people could be seen at the door, and a high fence surrounded it.\r\nBetween this building and the place where they were standing a road ran,\r\nand along this road some cattle were passing. Beyond the building lay\r\na sheet of water that looked like a harbor, between which and the sea\r\nextended a narrow spit of land; in several of the fields cattle were\r\ngrazing; and within stone’s throw they saw a rude farm-house, built of\r\nlogs, and whitewashed.\r\n\r\nPat was the first to break the silence into which they had been thrown\r\nby the utter astonishment and bewilderment of this discovery.\r\n\r\n“Sure an it’s dead beat I am, and dumb entirely,” he exclaimed. “Ony\r\nto think of our coming out of the wuds to the say. Sure an it must be\r\nMiramichi itself, so it must, an we’ve been a wandherin through the\r\nwuds sthraight back to the place we dhruv out from wid de Injin. Och,\r\nan, be the powers, but it’s a quaire wandherin that we’ve been havin.\r\nOch, but I’ll nivir git over this.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t Miramichi,” said Bart, whom Pat’s wild remarks had roused\r\nfrom the stupor into which his amazement had thrown him. “It isn’t\r\nMiramichi,” he repeated; “for that’s a river, and here we have the open\r\nsea itself. But where in the world we have got to, and how we’ve got\r\nhere, I confess I have no more idea than a stone.”\r\n\r\nBart’s surprise was certainly greater than that of either of his\r\ncompanions, and very naturally too. For he had thought all along that\r\nhe was going west, and that his back was turned to the sea: but now he\r\nfound that his actual course had been the very opposite of what he had\r\nsupposed, and intended it to be. He had been trying to get to where Phil\r\nwas, but now discovered that he had been going away from him all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the truth was amazing, bewildering, and at the same\r\ntime humiliating to one who had been officiating in the dignified part\r\nof leader in this adventurous and eventful journey. But humiliating as\r\nit was, there was the actual fact, and it only remained to find out the\r\nname of the place where they had so strangely arrived.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his anxiety about Phil, and his mortification about his own\r\nmistake, Bart was not altogether without a feeling of relief at this\r\nsight that revealed itself, for he saw human habitations at any rate;\r\nand he thought that he would now be able not only to find out where he\r\nwas, but also, perhaps, to get assistance, and thus resume, under more\r\nfavorable circumstances, the difficult task of exploring the woods in\r\nsearch of Phil.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, at length, “there’s no use standing here. We’re\r\nsomewhere, and the best thing we can now do is to find out where we\r\nare. So come along. We’re in a place where we’ll be able to get food and\r\nshelter, at any rate.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he started off for the nearest house, and in a short time\r\nreached it. At first no one was visible; but on knocking at the door a\r\nwoman made her appearance.\r\n\r\n“We’ve lost our way in the woods,” said Bart. “Can you tell me what\r\nplace this is?”\r\n\r\nThe woman stared at him for a moment, and then at Pat and Solomon. Then\r\nshe said,--\r\n\r\n“This place? Why, don’t you know this place? This is Tracadie.”\r\n\r\n“Tracadie!” repeated Bart. The name was familiar to him, for he had\r\noften seen it on the map, and had often heard it mentioned. He knew it\r\nas a small settlement on the shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, though\r\nhow in the world he could ever have wandered here still remained a\r\nprofound mystery.\r\n\r\nBart then informed her that one of his party had been lost in the woods,\r\nand asked her if any boy had made his appearance, or had been heard of,\r\nin the settlement. The woman shook her head. Upon this Bart asked her\r\nif they could get any one in the place to help them go off in search of\r\ntheir lost friend. The woman did not know, but advised them to see the\r\npriest, and offered to take them to the priest’s house.\r\n\r\nThis house was not far away, and it did not take long to reach it.\r\nIt was a pretty little cottage surrounded by trees, situated a little\r\ndistance away from the road. Fortunately, the priest was at home. He was\r\na wiry little man, with a benevolent face and most engaging manners. The\r\nmoment he understood their errand, he insisted on giving them something\r\nto eat and drink, and refused to hear anything more until they had all\r\nsatisfied their hunger.\r\n\r\nThus, then, they found themselves once more under a roof, after their\r\nlong and eventful wandering. This was the fourth day since their\r\ndeparture from Miramichi. The first day they had driven for some twenty\r\nmiles or so, and had walked far enough to reach a point which must have\r\nbeen nearly thirty miles from their starting-place. The second day they\r\nhad walked ten or twelve miles farther, to the little river, where they\r\nhad fished. The third day they had lost themselves, and had wandered\r\nfrom early dawn till dusk. The fourth day they had walked since\r\ndaybreak, and had reached Tracadie towards evening. The last day had\r\nbeen the most fatiguing of all; partly on account of the oppressiveness\r\nof the atmosphere; partly because their provisions had given out, so\r\nthat they had to walk for an immense distance without any food; and\r\npartly, also, because their hopes of finding Phil had died out, leaving\r\nthem in a state of deep depression.\r\n\r\nOn hearing their story, the priest showed the deepest sympathy, and\r\npromised to do all that he could.\r\n\r\n“You wish,” said he, “to go back to the woods again, and take a guide?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if we can find one.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I think I know of one or two men who will be suitable; and if\r\nthey are at home, they will be able to start as soon as you wish.”\r\n\r\n“How near do you think this fire is?” asked Bart, anxiously. “Is there\r\nany likelihood that it is at all near?”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid there is,” said the priest.\r\n\r\n“Are these woods often on fire?”\r\n\r\n“Pretty often, in different places. These woods, in fact, are famous for\r\nfires. You’ve heard of the Great Fire of Miramichi? I can tell you\r\nall about that--but not now. These woods are a younger growth; the old\r\nforest was all swept away.”\r\n\r\nAt the mention of this Great Fire, of which he had heard, Bart’s heart\r\nsank within him. It was indeed a place of ill omen where poor Phil had\r\nlost himself; and what chance could there be for him in the presence of\r\nthe merciless fire?\r\n\r\n“I can’t make out the place where your friend was lost,” said the\r\npriest; “but I dare say the men I’ll bring will be able to understand\r\nwhere it is. They’ve been all through the woods in all directions,\r\nand ought to know every stream and every rock in it. Big rocks are not\r\ncommon here, and the one you speak of ought to be a very conspicuous\r\nlandmark. But I won’t delay now any longer. I’ll go off at once; and I\r\nhope you’ll make yourselves comfortable till I return.”\r\n\r\nThe priest was a Frenchman; but he had lived here many years, and he\r\nspoke English almost like a native. His eager offer of help and active\r\nassistance greatly encouraged them, and they hoped for the best. Pat,\r\nin particular, showed this feeling in the strongest manner. He had been\r\nquite silent during the latter part of the walk, owing to fatigue and\r\nhunger combined; but now the short rest had refreshed him, and the\r\nrepast had strengthened and cheered him. He accepted the promise of the\r\npriest as almost a certain token of success, and at once regained all\r\nhis habitual confidence, and indulged in a long series of rattling,\r\njoyous remarks as to Phil’s present condition, and the probable state of\r\nhis mind when they should find him.\r\n\r\nAt length he rose from his seat, and said he was going out to take a\r\nwalk. He asked Bart and Solomon to go with him; but both declined. In\r\nspite of his long walk Pat could not sit still, but was restless and\r\nfidgety, and wanted to be moving about, even though his legs were yet\r\naching from their long and arduous tramp. So, leaving Bart and Solomon,\r\nhe went out of the house and along the road. After a while he came to\r\nanother road, which led down to the water. It led to that irregular\r\nwhitewashed building which they had seen from the eminence as they first\r\nemerged from the wood. Pat’s idea of the place was, that it was an inn;\r\nand so he sauntered along with the intention of reaching the water and\r\nhaving a swim.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the house, he noticed something very dreary and\r\nrepellent in its appearance. The high fence around the adjacent ground\r\ngave it the air of a prison. Several people were in front of it, most\r\nof them sitting down. As Pat passed on he noticed that some of these had\r\ntheir heads bound up; others had their arms in slings; others had faces\r\nthat were pale and emaciated. All of them watched him with wistful,\r\ncurious eyes; with such looks as prisoners give through their jail\r\nwindows at the passer-by. This strange look filled Pat with still\r\ngreater surprise.\r\n\r\n“It must be a hospital,” he thought; “but what ‘ud they be wan tin of a\r\nhospital in a scrap of a place like this?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” he thought again, “it’s a watherin place, an these are sick\r\npeople that have come here to be thraited wid the custhomary rimidies.”\r\n\r\nPassing by this place, he at length reached the beach, and walked along\r\nit for some distance before he found a place which appeared altogether\r\nsuitable for his swim. About a mile away there ran a long spit of land,\r\nwhich seemed to shut out this piece of water from the outer sea, and\r\nmade it seem like a lake. The water was calm and deliciously warm. Pat\r\nsprang in, and dived, and swam, and floundered about for a long time;\r\nand when at length he returned to the shore, he felt reinvigorated in\r\nevery limb. All his fatigue seemed to have departed, and he felt almost\r\nfresh enough to begin a new tramp through the woods.\r\n\r\nThe priest returned after a short absence, bringing two men with him.\r\nThey were both French, and spoke only broken English. They listened to\r\nthe story of Bart, and asked a number of particular questions about the\r\nstream and the rock. They declared that they knew the place perfectly\r\nwell; that there was only one rock of that description in the country,\r\nand that the place was about thirty miles away; by which Bart began\r\nto understand more clearly the full magnitude of his tramp. The men\r\nexpressed a willingness to go whenever they were wanted, and it was\r\nfinally agreed that they should start at daybreak on the following\r\nmorning. With this understanding, the men took their departure.\r\n\r\nIt was dusk when Pat returned. He came towards the house whistling as\r\ncheerily as a bird, and the moment he entered he began telling what a\r\ndelicious walk he had had. He then thought of the strange building near\r\nthe shore, and asked the priest what it was.\r\n\r\n“That?” said the priest. “O, that’s the Lazaretto.”\r\n\r\n“The Lazaretto?” repeated Pat, not understanding him.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the priest; “have you not heard of it?”\r\n\r\n“The Lazaretto--niver a word surely. An what is the Lazaretto, thin?”\r\n\r\n“O, it’s a place where we keep lepers.”\r\n\r\n“Lepers!” cried Pat, in a voice of horror; and his ruddy face changed to\r\na sickly pallor.\r\n\r\n“Lepers?” said Bart. “Lepers? What, lepers here, in this country?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the priest. “It’s a miserable story. A great many years\r\nago a French ship was wrecked in the Miramichi River. There were some\r\nclothing and bedding on board that came from the Levant, and the people\r\nhere used them; and it is said that from this clothing they caught this\r\nterrible disease. It has continued here ever since, and the place has\r\nbeen established here for the poor creatures.”\r\n\r\n“Lepers!” groaned Pat again. “An me walkin by that place, and thinkin of\r\ngoin in.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a terrible thing,” said the priest. “The patients who go there are\r\ndead to their friends. They never can hope to see them again.”\r\n\r\n“Och, murdher!” cried Pat, starting up. “What’ll iver become of me? Och,\r\nmurdher! Why didn’t somebody tell me?”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” asked the priest, in surprise.\r\n\r\n“Och, everything’s the matther. Sure, an didn’t I go an swim for over\r\nhalf an hour in the leper wather, down yondher?”\r\n\r\n“Leper water?” said the priest. “What is that?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, the lake down there, or the cove, or whatever ye call it. Don’t\r\nthey all go there an bathe?”\r\n\r\n“I dare say they do; but what of that?”\r\n\r\n“Och, murdher! The wather’s all fairly pisoned wid the leprosy, an I’m\r\nlost and gone intirely.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” said the priest; “don’t be alarmed. It isn’t contagious.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, an how do I know that it isn’t?”\r\n\r\nThe priest smiled.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said he, “I’m a proof of that, I suppose. I’ve lived here a great\r\nmany years, and I’ve visited the poor creatures all that time regularly.\r\nI’ve shaken hands with them, and attended to all the duties of religion\r\namong them, but without any evil consequences.”\r\n\r\nAs the priest said this, Pat rose slowly to his feet, with a face of\r\nperfect horror. Even Bart experienced a slight feeling of repugnance as\r\nhe thought that he was in familiar intercourse with one who had been so\r\nmuch in contact with lepers. But the priest’s calm, good-natured face,\r\nand his assurance that the disease was not contagious, quelled his\r\nrising fears, and the thought of that priest’s self-sacrifice made him\r\nfeel ashamed of that cowardly feeling.\r\n\r\nBut with Pat it was different. The thought that the priest had touched\r\nthe lepers; that on this very day he may have been there shaking hands\r\nwith them; that he had been coming and going for years between his house\r\nand the Lazaretto,--all this filled him with terror. If that disease had\r\nbeen originally communicated by means of clothing, why should it not\r\nyet communicate itself in the same way? The whole house might be reeking\r\nwith the insidious seeds of the deadly disease.\r\n\r\nThe thought was too horrible.\r\n\r\nHe murmured some inarticulate words, and went out of the house.\r\n\r\nThe priest went on talking with Bart, and for a long time no notice was\r\ntaken of Pat’s absence. But hours passed, and bedtime came, and still\r\nthere were no signs of him. Bart went out to call him.\r\n\r\nPat was not visible; but Bart saw a sight that drove all thoughts of Pat\r\nout of his mind. Pat, in fact, had fled, determining to sleep anywhere\r\nrather than in the priest’s house; and so Bart saw no signs of him. But\r\nthe sight that he did see was awful beyond description.\r\n\r\nThere, where his eyes first turned, he saw the gloomy shadow of the\r\nforest. Overhead the sky was filled with rolling smoke clouds; and\r\nimmediately above the range of the forest trees there was a long line of\r\nred,--dull, lurid, dark,--yet sustained and unintermittent, lying like a\r\nfoundation of fire under all the moving mass of smoke.\r\n\r\nThe priest had followed him out. He looked at it for some time in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“The fire is nearer,” he said, at last.\r\n\r\n“And there is where we must go to-morrow,” said Bart; “and Phil is\r\nthere!”\r\n\r\nThe priest said nothing.\r\n\r\nWhere--where--O, where is Phil? Such was now the one thought of Bart’s\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n_Where? O where is Phil?--The Wanderer in the Woods.--Struggles\r\nwith Difficulties that always increase.--Approach of\r\nNight.--Gloom.--Despair.--Climbing a Tree.--No Hope.--Rallying from the\r\nAssault.--A Midnight Meal.--Overworn Nature seeks Repose._\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE, O, where was Phil?\r\n\r\nHad he indeed fallen a victim to the vengeance of the Indian? or had he\r\nwandered away through those terrible woods to encounter the fires, and\r\nto perish by them?\r\n\r\nWhile Bart is racking his mind with these anxious questions, and trying\r\nin vain to answer them, let us leave him and follow the fortunes of the\r\nwanderer.\r\n\r\nThe rock that had risen on the shore of the river extended for about a\r\nhundred yards. Phil could have crossed the river and gone down on the\r\nother side, but it seemed swampy over there, and he thought it would be\r\neasier to pass over the rock. He also thought that there might be some\r\nview from the top which would give him a general idea of the country.\r\n\r\nHe therefore started off, and clambered to the top of the rock. On\r\nreaching it, however, he did not find any view in particular, for the\r\ntrees around it rose so high that they intercepted the prospect. He\r\ntherefore went on, intending to reach the river again lower down.\r\nOn traversing the rock and reaching its lower end, he found that it\r\nterminated in an abrupt precipice. This precipice here ran back from the\r\nriver into the woods, and if Phil still wished to reach the lower part\r\nof the stream, he saw that it would be necessary to go back into the\r\nwoods till he found a place where he could clamber down the side of the\r\nrock. He therefore set off in that direction, expecting that he would\r\nonly have to go a short distance. But the rock ran on much farther than\r\nhe had supposed; and it was still too precipitous for him to descend.\r\nAlong the edge there was a dense growth of underbrush which prevented\r\nhis walking close to it, and forced him to go along at some distance\r\naway from it, and penetrate from time to time to the edge, to see if he\r\nhad reached any place which offered a descent.\r\n\r\nAt length the rock subsided into the ground, and then Phil was able to\r\nseek the river. He walked along for some time in that direction, keeping\r\nthe line of rock in sight as a guide; but at length the woods became so\r\nexceedingly dense that it was quite impossible to keep the rock in sight\r\nalways. He therefore wandered off at times to avoid difficult places,\r\nreturning again as soon as convenient to seek the guidance of his\r\nlandmark. At length he plunged into a very dense and difficult part of\r\nthe forest, where he had to make so many turns and detours to avoid the\r\nobstacles that rose in his way, that he soon lost all idea of the right\r\ndirection. He struggled onward, however, striving to get into the open\r\nfrom which he might gain sight of his rock; but the farther he went\r\nonward, the more difficult did it seem to grow, and the less prospect\r\nwas there of any open ground. Upon this he turned, and tried to retrace\r\nhis steps, anxious at all hazards to get free from this entanglement.\r\nBut to retrace his steps was not so easy. He had got in, but to get out\r\nwas a different matter altogether. His frequent turnings and twistings\r\nhad already bewildered him; and as he had still to keep up the same\r\ncrooked course, and turn and twist as much as ever, his bewilderment\r\nincreased. Still he was not at all alarmed as yet, for the thought of\r\nany actual danger had not begun to occur. He was only perplexed, and at\r\nthe same time slightly vexed at the continuance of the jungle into which\r\nhe had tumbled. There was no help for it, however; and so he toiled\r\non as well as he could, and at length, to his satisfaction, found the\r\nunderbrush diminishing very perceptibly. This discovery encouraged him,\r\nand he kept on in this direction, for now his chief desire was, first of\r\nall, to get to some place where he could regain sight of the rock; and\r\nso he walked on as rapidly as possible, until at length the woods became\r\nsufficiently open to make his progress as easy as he could expect.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him now that he had been a long time wandering, and he\r\nbegan to be anxious to discover the rock. How to do so he did not know,\r\nand could only think of climbing a tree so as to take a survey of\r\nthe country. Unfortunately none of the trees were very large; but he\r\nselected the tallest one that he could find, and climbed up as high\r\nas he could. He now looked all around. The prospect gave but little\r\nsatisfaction. On every side other trees arose above the level of his\r\noutlook, and shut out from view the scene beyond. He therefore learned\r\nnothing whatever from this survey, and was compelled to descend\r\ndisappointed. What now to do became a serious question. There was the\r\nrock, and there was the river, either of which it would be equally\r\nadvisable to regain; but in what direction did they lie? It seemed to\r\nhim that the rock ought to be west of his present position, and the\r\nriver south. If he could go either westward, or southward, or in any\r\nintermediate direction, he would regain his course. Yet that was the\r\nvery thing that he was unable to do. He had no compass, and now bitterly\r\nregretted that he had not brought one. Overhead there was nothing that\r\ncould afford him any assistance, for the sky was all overspread with\r\nthat smoke which he had noticed all along, and the sun could not be\r\nseen. There was nothing left, therefore, but bare conjecture.\r\n\r\nHe now tried, as far as possible, to recall his confused wanderings.\r\nAlthough he could not, of course, recall the details of his journey,\r\nyet, as he thought it over, it seemed to him that, on the whole, he had\r\nbeen making progress in some one direction, and that, if he could but go\r\nback, he would be more likely to reach the river or the rock than in any\r\nother way. As he looked back over his course, it seemed to him that the\r\nwest lay there, and to the left of that was the south; so that if he\r\ncould now only effect some progress in that direction, all would be\r\nwell. He therefore made up his mind to go back again, as far as going\r\nback over his lost track was possible; and as he could not think of\r\nplunging again into that thicket, he thought that when he reached it he\r\nwould turn to the left, and avoid it if possible in that way.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he now set out in the endeavor to go back on his path. No\r\nvestige of anything like a trail appeared to him, nor was there a single\r\nthing that he remembered having seen before. He walked on now for a long\r\ntime, expecting every moment to reach that tangled thicket which he\r\nhad considered as the chief difficulty in his way back. To his utter\r\namazement, he came across no tangled thicket of any kind whatever. The\r\nwoods, instead of growing denser, seemed to grow more open, and his\r\nprogress grew easier. The woods now were precisely like what they had\r\nbeen daring their walk early in the day.\r\n\r\nAt first he felt only surprise; but soon surprise deepened into\r\nuneasiness, and uneasiness into anxiety. Where was he? In what direction\r\nwas he going? What should he do if he were going wrong? Such were the\r\nthoughts that came to him. At length his anxiety grew so strong, and\r\nhe became so convinced that his course was altogether wrong, that he\r\nstopped, and again tried to think how he might rectify his error. Once\r\nmore he climbed a tree, but with the same result as before. The tops\r\nof other trees were all around. Nothing appeared which could act as a\r\nguide. Overhead, the smoky covering which overspread the skies shut out\r\nall traces of the sun; and when he descended to the ground, there began\r\nto dawn upon him the conviction, which grew stronger and stronger every\r\nmoment, that he was actually lost! hopelessly and utterly lost! and\r\nthat, too, in a trackless and uninhabited forest.\r\n\r\nHis only hope was, that he had not gone very far away, but was still, if\r\nnot within sight of his friends, at least within hearing. So upon this\r\nhe began to do what he now knew he ought to have done before. He began\r\nto call in a loud voice after Pat, and Bart, and Solomon. After each\r\ncall he stopped and listened for an answer. But no answer came, and his\r\nown calls echoed far away through the forest aisles, and it was only the\r\nmocking sound of these echoes that came to his ears. Still he thought\r\nthat if he persevered long enough, some response must finally come. He\r\nthought they must be near enough to hear him, but were too intent upon\r\ntheir fishing to think of him, or to notice his cries. Besides, he\r\ntook comfort in the thought that they had not yet missed him, and\r\nconsequently would not be on the alert. His cries might be faint in\r\ntheir ears, and not excite any notice.\r\n\r\nThe time passed, and still he kept up his cries. He called in every\r\npossible tone, and made use of every shout that his voice could compass,\r\nsometimes calling their names, sometimes uttering shrieks, and howls,\r\nand shrill yells. But all these were unavailing, and he was at last\r\ncompelled to desist, from utter weariness and loss of voice.\r\n\r\nAnd now he noticed that it began to grow darker. At first this discovery\r\ngave him an unpleasant shock, but immediately he began to find comfort\r\nin this circumstance.\r\n\r\n“When it grows dark,” he thought, “they’ll miss me, and they’ll come to\r\nhunt me up. They’ll hear me if I call--or, better yet, they themselves\r\nwill now do the shouting, and I’ll hear them.”\r\n\r\nWith this thought he kept perfectly still. The darker it grew, the more\r\nintently did he listen; for he was convinced that by this time they must\r\nhave discovered his absence, and must be searching after him. The only\r\nthing that troubled him was the remembrance of his last words to Pat.\r\nHe had told Pat that he was going down the stream, and they might make\r\ntheir first search after him in that direction, and this he did not\r\nthink would bring them within hearing; for though he had no idea where\r\nhe was, he still had every reason to believe that he was nowhere near\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nIt now grew darker and darker; yet still to his strained ears there had\r\nnot come a single sound to tell him that his friends were near; not a\r\nsingle cry, however faint, however remote, to make known to him that\r\nthey were on the search after him. As the time passed away, the long,\r\nlong suspense and the protracted disappointment began to fill him with\r\nthe deepest gloom--and he began to know to its fullest extent that\r\n“agony of hope deferred that maketh the heart sick.” At length it grew\r\nso dark, that even his hope, tenacious as it was, could no longer shut\r\nout from his mind the conviction that whatever anxiety his friends might\r\nfeel, it was simply impossible for them at this time to make any search\r\nwhatever. If they had missed him, and had sought for him, they must have\r\ngone in a direction different from that in which he had gone, and must\r\nhave been altogether out of hearing.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he fully recognized this fact, all his energies gave way,\r\nand he sank down upon the ground. Not until this moment had he known how\r\nexhausted he was, and how oppressive the sultry atmosphere. Thus far his\r\nexcitement, first to regain his lost path, and latterly to communicate\r\nwith his friends or hear from them, had so taken possession of him,\r\nthat heat or fatigue, or any other bodily sensation, was not noticed.\r\nAnxiety, eager effort, pertinacious hope,--all these had by turns\r\ninfluenced him; but now, as there seemed no further chance either for\r\naction or for expectation, his strength collapsed, and he gave way\r\nutterly. He lay upon the ground, his head resting upon some moss,\r\nand yielded himself up both in mind and in body to the misery of his\r\nsituation. The severe exertions that he had made had utterly exhausted\r\nhim; the conflict of soul that he had endured, had intensified that\r\nexhaustion; and for a long time he remained motionless, gasping for\r\nbreath, and in a state of utter despair.\r\n\r\nNow, the night came down--sultry, torrid, oppressive, suffocating. Its\r\nintense blackness covered everything in an impenetrable veil. Its effect\r\nupon the others has already been described, and upon Phil it\r\nproduced results more fearful still. Had it not been for that unusual\r\noppressiveness and that Egyptian darkness, he might have roused himself;\r\nbut as it was, he gave up utterly, and remained sunk in the profoundest\r\ndespair for hours.\r\n\r\nAt length a change came over him. In spite of the heat of the night, the\r\nlong rest had been beneficial, and it was not in the nature of things\r\nthat emotions so strong should last very long. Phil’s mind was buoyant,\r\nhis temper cheerful, and hope was always strong in his soul. As he lay\r\nthere sleepless, his thoughts began to revolt against the gloom that had\r\noverwhelmed him.\r\n\r\n“What a fool I am!” he thought, rousing himself, and sitting up. “After\r\nall, what is it? and why should I knock under this way? Me, too--of all\r\nfellows! after that tremendous adventure at the Falls.”\r\n\r\nThe moment his thoughts reverted to that fearful adventure his gloom\r\nvanished. He now recalled the incidents of that terrific event. He\r\nthought of the frenzied struggle against the grip of the resistless\r\nwaters; he thought of the wild plunge into the seething flood, and of\r\nthat horrible moment when the rolling torrents overwhelmed him, and\r\nhurled him downward into awful depths. Then he recalled the events of\r\ntheir drift down the harbor, and out towards the bay, when there seemed\r\nnot the faintest chance of escape.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with this his present situation seemed trifling. To be\r\nlost in the woods, what was that? Was it equal to being lost in the\r\nterrible tide, and environed in impenetrable fogs? Could it under any\r\npossibility be so bad as being swept out to sea, a helpless victim of the\r\npitiless waves? There was no comparison between the two cases.\r\n\r\nAnd now his depression fled, and the buoyancy of his soul lifted him up\r\nto hope. He began to think over his prospects cheerfully, and to make\r\nplans about the following day. As soon as daylight came, his friends\r\nwould at once come in search of him. He would listen and hear their\r\ncalls. If he could not think of any direction in which to go, he could\r\nwait. But as to that, he did not expect to be so puzzled as he had been.\r\nThe sun would surely shine, and that would give him an idea of east,\r\nwest, north, and south. He might then choose his route, and follow it\r\nup. If his friends did not come, he could go off himself, and doubtless\r\nhe would reach some place eventually. He might find some stream, and\r\nfollow it to its mouth, where there would be sure to be a settlement;\r\nor perhaps he might light upon some clearing in the woods where he might\r\nobtain help, and perhaps regain his friends.\r\n\r\nThus Phil’s thoughts grew more and more cheerful; and he looked forward\r\nmost hopefully, and persisted in putting the best appearance on things.\r\nAt length he began to think that his long fast was not good for him,\r\nespecially as he might have some hard work to do on the morrow; so he\r\nopened his basket, and taking out his sandwiches that he had carried\r\nthere all the day, he made a hearty meal. The effect was most\r\nbeneficial; the hollow, craving, gnawing feeling that had distressed him\r\npassed away, and was succeeded by a sense of comfort.\r\n\r\nAnd now drowsiness began to steal over him. He had satisfied his hunger;\r\nhe had overcome by his long rest the first painful exhaustion and\r\nfatigue consequent upon his severe exertions; above all, his mind had\r\nattained a pleasant state of cheerfulness and hope. There were no longer\r\nany despairing thoughts or terrible fears to excite him and keep him\r\nawake; and so at length he fell into a sound and refreshing sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n_The Wanderer on his winding Way.--The Bewilderment of the\r\nForest.--Swamps and Bogs.--? The friendly Brook.--Following the Flow\r\nof the running Water.--A pleasant Course.--An encouraging\r\nDiscovery.--Astray once more.--He sinks to Rest.--The last Sandwich._\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was very late when Phil fell asleep, and his fatigue and exhaustion\r\ncombined to make his sleep heavy and prolonged. As there were no sounds\r\nto break in upon his slumbers, he continued sleeping until late on the\r\nfollowing day. On awaking he raised himself up, and looked around in\r\nsurprise, for in his dreams he had been wandering among familiar scenes,\r\nand it was some time before he could comprehend his present situation.\r\nBut his mossy bed at the foot of a large maple tree, and the woods that\r\nextended all around on every side, soon enabled him to recall the events\r\nof the preceding day, and to understand how he came here.\r\n\r\nThese recollections were not cheerful, nor was it a pleasant change to\r\nturn from happy dreams to such an awakening as this; yet Phil was not\r\ncast down. He still felt the beneficial effect of those better thoughts\r\nof the night before; and still retained that buoyancy of spirit and that\r\nhopefulness which he had felt on going to sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd now another day had dawned, with its possibilities for good and\r\nevil. His watch told him, to his amazement, that it was after ten\r\no’clock. Ten o’clock! After ten o’clock, and yet no signs of Bart\r\nand the others! What did this mean? Had they neglected him so long?\r\nNeglected him? No. They could not do that; but was it not possible that\r\nduring his sleep they may have wandered about these woods near him, and\r\ncalled to him while he could not hear them? This was a most distressing\r\nthought, and if such a thing had happened, its result would bring a\r\ntwofold evil; for in the first place, he would have missed the chance of\r\ndeliverance, and in the second place, they would not be likely to pass\r\nby here again. But these thoughts were not of a kind that he chose to\r\nentertain. He was in no mood now to sink into despondent inaction.\r\nHe was tired of this place, and was anxious to leave it. He was also\r\nwearied of inaction, and was eager to do something. Far better did\r\nit seem to him to do anything, and go anywhere, even if he should be\r\nunsuccessful, than to remain here waiting for those who might never\r\ncome. So he at once dismissed all idle thoughts and useless regrets, and\r\naddressed himself to the task of arranging his own course of action.\r\n\r\nHe saw at once that the points of the compass were as much a mystery as\r\never. The first glance upward showed him that the sky was darker than\r\never, that its covering was more opaque, that the smoke was nearer\r\nto the earth. The air also, was close and oppressive. The sun was not\r\nvisible, and therefore his hope failed of finding some course which he\r\nmight pursue by this means. What, then, was he to do?\r\n\r\nThe first thing that he decided on doing was, to take his breakfast.\r\nNow, he had eaten pretty freely on the preceding night, and therefore it\r\nwas with some concern that he opened his basket and examined his stores.\r\nThat concern was certainly not at all lessened when he found that he had\r\nonly two sandwiches left.\r\n\r\nTwo sandwiches!\r\n\r\nRather a small supply of provisions for one who was lost in the midst of\r\nthe forest, and had no idea whatever when he might be able to find his\r\nway out. Phil would not allow himself to feel anxious about this, yet at\r\nthe same time he was prudent enough to look out for the future; and so,\r\nthough he was hungry, and felt the need of a good breakfast, yet he did\r\nnot feel inclined to devour all of his slender stock at that one meal.\r\nHe chose rather to exercise some self-denial; and so he contented\r\nhimself with only one sandwich, and put the other back, reserving it for\r\na time of need.\r\n\r\nHe now felt thirsty, and began to look around for water. He could not\r\nfind any for a long time. Meanwhile, as he walked about, the exertion\r\nmade him much more sensitive to the closeness and heat of that torrid\r\natmosphere, and so aggravated his thirst that it began to torment him\r\nto an intolerable degree. At length, to his great joy, he found a swampy\r\nplace; and, stooping down, he tore out the moss and sods, and scooped up\r\nthe black mud that was underneath, until at last some black, discolored\r\nwater appeared. He took a few mouthfuls of this without hesitation, and\r\nthen, scooping out some more mud, he waited till the water should grow\r\nclearer. The particles of mud after a time settled at the bottom, and\r\nthe water became clear enough for Phil to drink it; and though it was\r\ndisagreeably warm, it yet refreshed him.\r\n\r\nHe now resumed his course. This swamp lay in a slight hollow, and\r\nseemed to extend for some distance. He was loath to leave it, for the\r\nremembrance of his recent sufferings was strong within him; and so he\r\nwalked along the swampy hollow. To his surprise it extended for a long\r\ndistance, and to his great gratification the moisture of the ground\r\nincreased, until at length the bog became more and more marshy, and\r\npools of standing water became visible. He skirted the edge of the\r\nswamp, still walking on, and at length reached a place where a small\r\nbrook flowed on out of this swamp into the woods. Along this he walked\r\nfor a little distance, and then took another draught of the water,\r\nwhich he now found quite pure, and not so warm as to be unpleasant. Much\r\nrefreshed, he sat down by its edge, and once more began to deliberate\r\nabout the best course that he could take.\r\n\r\nHe did not like the state of things altogether. It was bad enough to be\r\nlost in the forest; but there were other things superadded which made\r\nhis situation far worse. For he now felt the oppressiveness of the air\r\nmost painfully, and the exertion of walking was far more exhaustive\r\nthan he had ever known it before. Besides, the atmosphere had a smoky\r\ncharacter, which was distressing, and the thick smoke clouds overhead\r\nshowed that something was going on in these woods that might ere long\r\nmake his situation much worse. There was, indeed, something ominous in\r\nthat sickly, leaden sky, in those rolling smoke clouds that hung so\r\nlow, in this suffocating air which he could not breathe with\r\ncomfort,--something ominous in the oppressive heat, and in the\r\nstagnation of the atmosphere. There was, however, a breeze; its signs\r\nwere visible overhead, but the woods were so dense that he could not\r\ngain any benefit from it. What the meaning of it all might be, he could\r\neasily conjecture; but the thought was too formidable to be entertained,\r\nand so he tried to dismiss it from his mind.\r\n\r\nAnd now, while he thought of what he ought to do, a plan of action\r\nsuggested itself which was so-simple, so feasible, and so full of\r\npromise, that he at once caught at it and proceeded to act upon it. This\r\nplan was nothing else than to follow the course of the brook. It would\r\nof course enlarge as it ran on. It might lead into a larger stream, and\r\nthat stream would be sure to bring him out somewhere. Besides, to be\r\nnear a stream would be of great advantage in many ways. It would be more\r\nopen, and lighter, and more airy than the thick recesses of the forest;\r\nits bed would offer a comparatively easy footpath, except where it might\r\nbecome too strong or swampy; and he would always be in the neighborhood\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nOn this idea he proceeded at once to act, and so resumed his journey,\r\nwalking in the bed of the little brook. The bottom afforded an easy\r\npath; and though the water was over his ankles, yet its coolness was\r\nrefreshing, and served to alleviate very materially the effects of the\r\nsultry atmosphere.\r\n\r\nBut on resuming his course, Phil saw that if he hoped to make any real\r\nprogress, he must divest himself of all useless encumbrances. His basket\r\nand his fishing-rod were of this description. He therefore sacrificed\r\nboth of them to the necessities of the occasion; but before he threw\r\nthem down, he removed the hook and line from the rod, so as to have it\r\nin case of need. And now, as he went on, he felt the benefit of this\r\ndisencumbrance; for the weight and inconvenience of these had been\r\nexcessively troublesome all along. Yet the line and hook were the only\r\nessential part of the rod, and the sandwich was the only necessary part\r\nof the basket; and these things were carried far more conveniently in\r\nhis pocket.\r\n\r\nThe brook flowed on, and gradually increased in volume by the occasional\r\naddition of other brooklets, which joined it in its course. The channel\r\ngrew broader, and the waters grew more abundant, sometimes spreading\r\nthemselves out wide over a pebbly bottom, at other times collecting\r\ninto deep pools, which Phil preferred avoiding. In spite of the\r\nirregularities and inequalities of its course, Phil preferred walking\r\nhere to wandering at random through the woods; in the first place, on\r\naccount of the reasons above mentioned; and in the second place, for the\r\nreason that it led to some definite point, and would not allow him to\r\nwander about blindly in a circle. The hopeless bewilderment which\r\nhad resulted from his forest wanderings on the previous day, made his\r\npresent course seem quite certain and definite in comparison.\r\n\r\nAt last, to Phil’s great delight, the brook joined another brook, which\r\nwas fully twice as large, though not as large as that stream where he\r\nhad been fishing. A vague hope had arisen in his mind that this brook\r\nmight lead him to that very stream, in which case he counted confidently\r\non finding his friends; but now he had walked so far that he gave up\r\nthis hope altogether, and had made up his mind to seek his own safety,\r\nirrespective of his friends. The new brook was quite as easy as the old\r\none; in fact, it was somewhat more so, for it was less irregular, and\r\npresented fewer inequalities of depths. Over its bed, then, Phil trudged\r\non, sometimes stopping to dash water over his face and head, at other\r\ntimes thrusting in his hands, and occasionally bending down to take a\r\ndrink. The presence of the brook thus proved of the greatest advantage\r\nto him, and its cool waters prevented him from feeling that exhaustion\r\nunder which he might otherwise have sunk utterly. In the broader pathway\r\nthat this brook afforded, he had also the chance of gaining advantage of\r\nany slight breeze or movement of the air that might take place; and thus\r\nin every way he was a gainer.\r\n\r\nAt length he came to another brook, into which this one discharged\r\nitself. The new brook was very much larger; and though not quite so\r\nlarge as the stream where they had been fishing, still it was not much\r\nsmaller. At first the only thought that came to Phil was, that he had\r\ncome back to this very stream itself from which he had started; but\r\nsoon, as he came to reflect upon the length of his wanderings, and upon\r\nthe probability that many streams ran through the forest, he gave up\r\nthis idea, and contented himself with following out the plan that he had\r\nadopted. This stream he thought might lead to some larger one, and\r\nthat larger one to some river, which might eventually bring him to the\r\nhabitations of man.\r\n\r\nThe fresh hopes that were now aroused within him lessened his fatigue,\r\nand stimulated him to new efforts. The bed of this stream was shallow\r\nand pebbly, sometimes deepening into pools, at other times bringing him\r\ninto the midst of swamps, and grasses, and rushes; but, on the whole,\r\nit was no more difficult than its predecessor had been; and his progress\r\nwas very satisfactory.\r\n\r\nAt length he came to a place where he saw something that sent a thrill\r\nof joy through his whole being.\r\n\r\nIt was a path!\r\n\r\nIt was an unmistakable path, narrow and rough, it is true, yet still a\r\npath. It seemed like one of those roads which are used in winter to draw\r\nlogs out of the woods, or fuel; yet whatever its purpose might be, there\r\nit was; and here at last Phil saw something that proved that he was\r\nnot cut off altogether from all association with human kind. That\r\npath seemed to promise escape, and seemed to lead him forth from the\r\nwilderness track to life and liberty.\r\n\r\nHe stood and looked at it long and carefully. It ran across the brook,\r\nand on either side it presented the same appearance. The question that\r\nnow arose in his mind was, which side should he choose--the right or the\r\nleft? There was nothing in the path that helped him to a decision; no\r\nfootmarks were visible to show him where to go; he was left altogether\r\nto chance and to his own instincts.\r\n\r\nAt length he decided to take the path on the right hand side, and\r\naccordingly he at once went on in this direction. The path was about\r\nsix feet wide, and was comparatively smooth; so smooth, indeed, that\r\nit seemed almost luxurious when compared with the irregularities of the\r\nbrook, with its alternations of gravel and swamp, which was also deep\r\nin water. Here, then, Phil walked along rapidly, and was so full of hope\r\nthat at every turn in the path he expected to see some house.\r\n\r\nThe path, as has been said, seemed like one of those which are used in\r\nthe winter only for lumbering purposes. At the present time it bore\r\nno marks whatever of recent use. No traces of wheels were visible,\r\nno footprints of any kind; yet it was level, for the ordinary\r\nirregularities seemed to have been smoothed away by the attrition of\r\nlogs which had been hauled over it.\r\n\r\nPhil walked on for several hours. He was very much fatigued; but\r\nthe new excitement that had arisen consequent upon this discovery had\r\nprevented him from giving way to his weariness, and had, in fact,\r\nroused him above it to such an extent that he was unconscious of it.\r\nHis expectation of meeting with some signs of humanity clung to\r\nhim incessantly as he walked along; and though he was constantly\r\ndisappointed, yet he constantly hoped, and persisted in the hope, in\r\nspite of disappointments.\r\n\r\nAt length, it began to grow darker, and he saw that evening was coming\r\non. He had been walking incessantly, with but one short rest, ever\r\nsince eleven o’clock. Under ordinary circumstances he could not have\r\nmaintained such a prolonged effort; and had he not met with this path\r\nhe would have sought rest long before this. But his intense desire to\r\nescape, which had been stimulated by this discovery of the path, drew\r\nhim on, and nerved him to new efforts. At the end of each hour he still\r\nhoped that the next hour would bring something; and so he kept on even\r\nafter the darkness began to deepen. Now, as the darkness increased, the\r\npath grew less and less perceptible, and at last he happened to get out\r\nof it at a place where there was a wide opening in the woods. Leaving\r\nit here, he wandered about until he discovered that he had lost it\r\naltogether. On making this discovery, he made no effort either to\r\nretrace his steps, or to find out the lost path. He was too much worn\r\nout to think of doing either. He simply gave up.\r\n\r\nA moss-covered mound was close beside him; and taking a seat here, he\r\ndetermined to remain for the night, and leave all further effort for the\r\nfollowing day. He was fearfully fatigued, and utterly worn out. When\r\nhe gave up he gave up completely. His only thought now was for his\r\nimmediate wants, and those wants comprised the two essentials of food\r\nand rest. Rest he could find here, on the mossy mound, under the forest\r\ntrees. As to food, thanks to his forethought and self-denial in the\r\nmorning, something yet remained. It was that sandwich which he had\r\nreserved for a time of need. The time of need had come, and he drew the\r\nsandwich from his pocket.\r\n\r\nHe looked at it for a moment solemnly and thoughtfully. It was his last\r\nsandwich--the very last of his little stock of provisions. Should he eat\r\nit all, or should he still preserve a little of it? It seemed unwise\r\nto eat it all. He broke it into two portions, and wrapping one up\r\ncarefully, he proceeded to eat the other. But on eating this he found\r\nhis appetite unappeased, and his craving for more was irresistible. He\r\nunwrapped what he had reserved and looked at it. Should he eat it? Dare\r\nhe eat it? To eat it would be to deprive himself of his last mouthful,\r\nand on the following morning he would have nothing with which to begin\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0187]\r\n\r\nHe looked at that small fragment of food with longing eyes, and the\r\nlonger he looked at it the more tempting did it seem, and the more\r\nirresistible did the temptation grow. At last he thought that it would\r\nbe better to strengthen himself now after his long journey, and secure a\r\ngood night’s rest.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow he could look out for food and get something to\r\neat--somewhere, he knew not where--somehow, he knew not how. This\r\nthought appeased his cautious scruples. He hesitated no longer, but ate\r\nwhat remained of the sandwich.\r\n\r\nAnd so his last particle of food was gone.\r\n\r\nBut he gave no thought to this. He was too tired, and worn out with\r\nexhaustion he lay down and fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n_Clouds and Vapors.--The exhaustive Heat.--Thirst.--Muddy Water.--The\r\nPangs of Hunger.--How to fish.--The River.--The placid Lake.--A\r\nPlunge into the Water.--The Midday Mead.--The Pine Woods.--The rocky\r\nCavern.--Preparing a Night’s Rest.--The Evening Repast.--Night once\r\nmore._\r\n\r\n\r\nON waking the next morning, Phil’s first impulse was to look above\r\nand around to see what might be the prospects for the day. To his\r\ndisappointment he found those prospects not at all changed for the\r\nbetter. Overhead he saw the rolling smoke clouds, which now were\r\ngloomier and denser than before, and still nearer the earth. The\r\natmosphere caught from them a very perceptible odor, which showed the\r\ncharacter of the clouds above, and was pungent enough to create some\r\ndegree of irritation in the nose and throat. The spot where he was\r\nappeared to be somewhat more open than usual, and in some directions he\r\ncould look over a space several rods in extent. In this direction the\r\nsmoke haze was very apparent.\r\n\r\nHe felt both hungry and thirsty. But he had nothing whatever to eat, and\r\nknew it. He had eaten his last mouthful the evening before, and there\r\nwas nothing whatever left now to satisfy the demands of his appetite.\r\nBut for the present his thirst was stronger than his hunger; and so\r\nparched was his throat, and so painful was his craving for water, that\r\nhe at once started up, and set out in search of some.\r\n\r\nHis object was now to regain that path which he had lost the night\r\nbefore, and follow it until he might find another brook, or at least a\r\nswamp. But though he sought most diligently, and most thoroughly, in\r\nall directions, still he could find no trace of it whatever. Bitter\r\nexperience had already taught him his own utter incapability of finding\r\nhis way back through these woods to any point from which he might have\r\nwandered, and so he soon gave up this search as useless: but in addition\r\nto this, his thirst was altogether too pressing to allow of any search\r\nafter lost paths. The one thing of his desire became water, and so he\r\nturned his attention towards finding this first necessity. He did not\r\nhave to undergo a very long trial. The woods were intersected in many\r\nplaces by small brooklets, and before long he came to a bog, in which\r\nhe obtained sufficient water to allay his thirst. By carefully examining\r\nthis, he found a place which was the outlet of a brook, and he now\r\npursued the same course which had been followed by him the day before;\r\nthat is, he walked along in the bed of the brook, hoping that it would\r\nlead to a stream.\r\n\r\nAs he walked along it grew larger and larger; other brooks joined it;\r\nand at length it ran into a stream which was quite as large as that one\r\nfrom which he had originally wandered. On reaching this he sat down on\r\nthe bank and rested. The stream was about a dozen yards wide here, and\r\nthe waters were shallow, running on among gravel and cobble stones. The\r\nbanks were bordered with trees, which rose to the height of about forty\r\nfeet, and threw their branches across the stream till they nearly met.\r\n\r\nSitting here and resting, Phil began to feel more hungry than ever. His\r\nwalk had only served to sharpen his appetite, and the alleviation of his\r\nthirst had brought out his hunger more prominently. And now what could\r\nhe do? To struggle forward all day without anything to eat would be\r\nalmost impossible. Already he felt exhausted from his walk thus far\r\nwithout food; and to commence again seemed out of the question. In his\r\nhunger he now tried to find something in the woods. He tore up some\r\ngrass, and chewed the roots; he peeled off some maple bark, and tried\r\nto chew this; but the grass roots and the maple bark had no perceptible\r\neffect in diminishing his hunger. At last he thought of his fishing line,\r\nwhich he had carried with him after throwing away the rod. Wondering why\r\nhe had been so stupid as not to think of this before, he proceeded\r\nto search for a suitable rod. This he found after a short time, and\r\nattaching the line to the end of it, he proceeded to try his skill at\r\nfishing. He walked down the stream for some distance, but for some time\r\nhe met with no success. He began to feel a little alarm, and to think\r\nthat the heat and the smoke prevented the fish from rising, when\r\nsuddenly, in the midst of his discouragement, he felt a nibble at\r\nthe hook. He jerked it up, but missed his prey that time; still the\r\ncircumstance encouraged him greatly, for it showed him that there was\r\nhope, and he continued his task with fresh spirit. At length, to his\r\nintense delight, he jerked out a fish. It was quite small, but still it\r\nwas indescribably welcome; and without waiting any longer, Phil at once\r\nproceeded to kindle a fire. He did this with little difficulty, and\r\nplacing the fish on the blazing sticks, he watched it until it seemed\r\nsufficiently cooked to be eaten. Although his hunger had made him too\r\nimpatient to wait till the fish was thoroughly cooked, yet that same\r\nhunger made him indifferent to little deficiencies of this sort, and\r\nthe half-raw trout seemed to him, without exception, the most delicious\r\nmorsel that he had ever eaten. He now resumed his rod, and before long\r\nhauled out another, which was soon followed by another, and yet another.\r\nBy this time the fire had died down to the coals, and on these Phil laid\r\nhis fish. This time he waited until they were so thoroughly cooked that\r\nthey would have satisfied the most fastidious appetite. On these Phil\r\nmade a right royal repast; and this supply of food seemed to him to be\r\nsufficient for any effort that he might have to make that day. Before\r\nstarting, however, he was provident enough to wait until he had caught\r\nthree more trout, so as to secure himself from again coming so close to\r\nabsolute starvation as he had been that morning; and then, putting these\r\nin his pocket, he rolled up very carefully his precious hook and line,\r\nand once more resumed his journey.\r\n\r\nHe had thus been able to satisfy both that thirst and that hunger which\r\nhad each assailed him so fiercely on his first awaking; and this\r\nfact gave to him a glow of satisfaction, and a confidence in his own\r\nresources, which dispelled the last vestige of his gloom, and filled him\r\nwith energy, and hope, and cheerfulness. In this frame of mind he set\r\nout on the renewal of his journey, not knowing any better than before\r\nwhere he was going, yet hoping for the best.\r\n\r\nThe brook ran on for some miles, receiving other brooks, and growing\r\ngradually larger. As a general thing, its bed afforded a sufficiently\r\neasy pathway for Phil to traverse, without any unusual exertion, and\r\nwas preferable, on the whole, to the forest with its underbrush.\r\nOccasionally, however, he was able to take advantage of favorable\r\nopenings among the trees, and on several occasions gained very much\r\nby taking short cuts, and avoiding certain bends in the river. On such\r\nshort cuts it is needless to say that he never ventured, unless he was\r\nable to see plainly where he was going. In this way he went on for some\r\nhours, and in that time he certainly succeeded in getting-over a large\r\nextent of ground.\r\n\r\nBut such exertions as these were not made easily; and soon the energy\r\nwith which he had started began to relax. He became more sensitive to\r\nthe heat, and it seemed to him that the smoke was growing more dense and\r\nmore distressing. He began to think that he must be drawing nearer to\r\nthe fires from which all this smoke and this oppressive heat arose.\r\nThe thought was a most disheartening one; for if it were true, it would\r\ntransform what seemed to be his pathway to safety into a blind rush\r\nto danger, and make of no avail all his long struggles that he had\r\nput forth so perseveringly. It was a thought, indeed, which was too\r\ndepressing for him to entertain, and so he strove to drive it from his\r\nmind; but it was one of those unpleasant ideas which cling to the mind\r\nin spite of itself, and so, notwithstanding Phil's efforts to hope for\r\nthe best, there lowered over him a very dark and dismal foreboding that\r\nhis present course would at length bring him face to face with the fire.\r\n\r\nAnd what then?\r\n\r\nAll, that he could not tell.\r\n\r\nShould he turn back now? No; that was a thing which he could not bear to\r\nthink of. Wherever he was going, he could not turn back yet--not till he\r\nwas convinced that it was all wrong--not till the very presence of the\r\nfire itself should force him to give up all hope of farther progress in\r\nthis direction.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his surroundings of oppressive heat and distressing smoke,\r\nof rough pathways and alternating wood and water,--in spite of his\r\nfatigue of body, and despondency of mind,--Phil still kept on his\r\ncourse, and struggled most heroically to maintain his onward march,\r\nwherever it might lead. At length he reached a place where the stream\r\nran in almost a straight line for a considerable distance; and looking\r\ndown this, he could see at the farthest extremity the smoky haze; but\r\nat the same time he felt confident that it was not a whit denser than it\r\nhad been in the morning. This discovery encouraged him; and now, if\r\nhe felt the smoke and the heat more keenly, he was able, with great\r\napparent reason, to attribute it solely to his own weariness of body.\r\n\r\n“I will rest soon,” he thought. “I will take a long rest, and get\r\nsomething to eat, and that will be sure to restore me.”\r\n\r\nWith this thought he went on; and though he had made up his mind to\r\nrest, yet he kept constantly postponing the period of that rest. At\r\nlength the stream took a turn round a wooded declivity, and as Phil went\r\nup this to cut across, he suddenly beheld lying immediately in front of\r\nhim a small lake, into which the stream ran.\r\n\r\nThe sight of this at once decided him to make this wooded declivity his\r\nresting-place. So he took his seat here on the shore, and looked out\r\nupon the scene before him. The lake was of no very great extent, and was\r\nsurrounded on all sides by trees. In front of Phil the beach was pebbly,\r\nand the waters clear and transparent; but on the right there was a wide\r\nextent covered over with green rushes, and water lilies, both yellow and\r\nwhite. As Phil looked forth upon this pleasant scene, the waters seemed\r\nso inviting and so clear, that he determined to take a bath. No sooner\r\nhad he thought of this than he was on his feet again, and in a very\r\nshort time had divested himself of his clothes and plunged in.\r\n\r\nHe plunged down into those sweet, clear, tranquil waters. As his head\r\nsank under the embrace of the cool flood, it seemed to convey new life\r\nand strength to every fibre of his wearied frame. It was one delicious\r\nmoment in a day of toil and trouble. He struck out and swam far off into\r\nthe middle of the lake. Then he dived again and again; and then, rolling\r\nover on his back, he lay floating, with his eyes closed, and his form\r\nreposing luxuriously upon its soft, watery couch. The water here was\r\nsufficiently clear and sufficiently deep for his purposes, the rushes\r\nand lilies were over upon the shore on one side, and there was nothing\r\nto mar his enjoyment. Here he forgot the heat and the smoke. The cool\r\nwaters took away from him all that sense of oppression which he had so\r\nlong felt, and when he at length landed, it was as though he had enjoyed\r\nsome prolonged rest for hours, or some profound and refreshing slumber.\r\n\r\nNow he resumed his clothes, and thought of those fish which he had been\r\ncarrying. On examining them, he found them slightly stale, yet not at\r\nall crushed, and thereupon he proceeded to kindle a fire upon the shore\r\nof the lake. Thus far he had found no difficulty in making his fires,\r\nfor he had matches with him, and there was no lack of dry twigs; so, in\r\na short time, a fire sufficient for his purposes was blazing merrily.\r\nPhil was in no hurry; so, lying down near it, and leaning on one elbow,\r\nhe watched it lazily, until sufficient coals had been formed, upon which\r\nhe might lay his fish.\r\n\r\nThe fish this time were even superior to what they had been on a former\r\noccasion, for Phil’s practice had shown him, to some extent, how they\r\ncould be broiled to the best advantage. All that they needed was a\r\nlittle salt and pepper; but he was too hungry to miss either of those\r\nseasonings. He found, indeed, in his case, the truth of the old saying,\r\nthat hunger is the best relish; and never in his life had he eaten any\r\nmeal with half the zest that he had known at the eventful meals of this\r\neventful day. A draught of water from the running stream completed his\r\nrepast, and he now lay down refreshed, and began to meditate over his\r\njourney. He had now rested for nearly two hours, and he began to feel\r\nlike resuming his march. It would be necessary, he saw, to walk around\r\nthe lake till he found its outlet, and then go along as before, and keep\r\non as long as his strength might hold out.\r\n\r\nOnce more, then, he rose strong, eager, resolute, and cheerful, hoping\r\nfor the best, and willing to go on in this course until he reached some\r\ndestination, wherever that might be. He walked along the lake shore, and\r\non reaching the other end, he found the outlet. This was nothing more\r\nthan a continuation of the stream down which he had been going,\r\nbut there was more water, for the lake probably received other\r\ncontributions; and what was more important, the bottom was muddy.\r\nFortunately, however, the woods here were free from underbrush, so that\r\nhe had no difficulty in walking through them, keeping the stream in\r\nsight. After going about a mile or so, he found, to his great delight,\r\nthat he had come to a pine forest. To him, after his long, rough walk,\r\nthis fact gave the greatest possible joy. For now the trees rose up\r\naround him at wide intervals, and no tangled underbrush stood in his\r\nway, forcing him to wind through them or lose himself in the attempt to\r\ngo around it. The pine forest allowed him to choose his own course and\r\nwalk almost as freely as though he were in an open field. Besides, the\r\nground under his feet gave a firm foothold. It was not like the soft\r\nmoss or long ferns of the other woods; it was not like the pebbly bed of\r\nthe stream; it was hard, and smooth, and afforded an easy pathway.\r\n\r\nAs Phil went on, he noticed that the stream grew much wider, though it\r\nstill remained shallow. Its waters flowed sometimes in the middle of the\r\nbed, sometimes on the right bank, and sometimes towards the left; while\r\nagain they distributed themselves over the whole of its wide bed, and\r\nbrawled, and gurgled, and bubbled onward among the stones and pebbles\r\nwith which its bed was again filled. At one place its channel divided,\r\nand a little island covered with trees arose in the midst, while the\r\nwaters, after flowing past in two streams, once more reunited. About a\r\nhalf mile below this another stream joined it, and the waters were very\r\nconsiderably increased.\r\n\r\nPhil walked along for several hours, and at length began to feel once\r\nmore that excessive weariness which he had felt before bathing in the\r\nlake. Once more the atmosphere grew exceedingly oppressive, and the\r\nsmoke distressed him. At length he came to a ledge of rocks, by the\r\nborders of the stream. As he came up he noticed something like an\r\nopening, and walked towards it. He saw that a huge mass of rock lay\r\ntilted over and resting against another mass in such a way that it\r\nformed a covered chamber about ten feet long and six feet wide. The\r\nfloor was a flat, rough rock, and the end consisted of damp moss.\r\nImmediately beside this the stream flowed along in a deeper channel than\r\nusual, for all its waters had gathered on this side, leaving the rest of\r\nits bed bare. Phil was so struck with the appearance of this place that\r\nhe examined it quite closely, and began to think that it would be an\r\nexcellent place to pass the night in. He could not have found it at a\r\nbetter time. Already it was growing a little dusk, and he was thoroughly\r\nworn out. In fact he was so tired that after stopping here one minute he\r\nfound it impossible to go forward any farther; so he at once resolved to\r\nstay.\r\n\r\nOn the top of the rock was a quantity of moss, and as he was going\r\nto pass the night here he proceeded to gather it, and collected a\r\nsufficient quantity to make a comfortable couch when strewed on the\r\nrocky floor of his little cave. But there were other things to do before\r\nhe should be able to rest. He was once more in a state of starvation,\r\nand the only thing for him to do was to resort to his fishing-line. He\r\nfound a pole without much trouble, and then threw his line. At first he\r\nmet with no success. But he persevered, and walked farther up the stream\r\ntill he came to a place that looked more favorable. Here his efforts\r\nwere crowned with success, for in a little time he had hooked no less\r\nthan six trout, one of which was large enough for a meal by itself.\r\n\r\nAfter this he took a bath in the running stream, and felt once more the\r\nsame invigorating and restorative effects from the cool water which he\r\nhad experienced during his bath in the lake.\r\n\r\nThen he kindled his fire on the edge of the stream, near his cave, and\r\ncooked two of the fish, reserving the others for the next morning.\r\n\r\nThis meal was as great a success as the former ones had been, and at\r\nlength he retired to the little cave where he had already spread the\r\nmoss for a bed. Here he could not help recalling the events of the\r\nday. He had hoped, on starting, by this time to have reached some human\r\nabode. He had not done so. But this, instead of exciting his regrets,\r\ngave way altogether to emotions of gratitude. He had been saved from\r\nthirst and from hunger in a most wonderful manner, and, even at this\r\nmoment, instead of feeling utterly exhausted, he had little else than a\r\nsense of languid weariness. All this filled him with thankfulness, and\r\nkneeling down in his little cave, he offered up his most grateful thanks\r\nto the merciful Being who had protected his wanderings during the day.\r\n\r\nAfter this he lay down on his moss and soon fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n_Bart.--An anxious Night.--Suspicions.--Reappearance of Pat.--The Woes\r\nof Pat.--A hideous Thought.--The Leper.--Off to the Woods.--Indian\r\nFile.--The Rear Guard.--Defection of Pat.--He makes a Circuit.--“Hyar!\r\nHyar! You dar? Whar Mas’r Bart?”_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE sight of the lurid glow which had burst upon Bart’s eyes as he\r\nlooked from the priest’s house excited within him anxious thoughts,\r\nwhich kept him awake for hours on that night; the thought that Phil was\r\nwandering in those woods, and that all around him were these wrathful\r\nflames; the thought that perhaps he might have already fallen a victim;\r\nthe thought that his search could scarcely be made now, since they could\r\nhardly hope to penetrate the woods for any distance; the thought that\r\nnow any search, however extensive, might perhaps be too late. He slept\r\nbut little. Every little while he would rise from his bed, and look out\r\nof the window towards the woods, to see if that lurid glow continued. It\r\nwas visible for a long time, but at length died out altogether. But this\r\ndid not lessen Bart’s anxieties, for now the smoke grew thicker, and the\r\nsmell of it was most unpleasantly perceptible, exciting the very natural\r\nthought that the fire glow was no longer visible, not because the fires\r\nwere extinguished, but rather because the smoke had grown so dense that\r\nit hid it from view.\r\n\r\nWhen Bart arose it was not yet daybreak, and on coming down stairs no\r\none was visible. He went out of doors, and paced up and down the\r\nroad uneasily. After a while two men made their appearance, whom Bart\r\nrecognized as the ones who were to be the guides in their exploration\r\nof the forest. He felt too anxious and too sick at heart to ask them\r\nanything, for he thought that anything they would say would only confirm\r\nhis worst fears, and as yet he did not wish to know the worst. He wished\r\nto cling to his hopes, faint though they now were, until hope should be\r\nno longer possible. After a while Solomon made his appearance; but Bart\r\nhad nothing to say to him, and the old man, seeing by his manner that he\r\ndid not wish to be spoken to, held aloof, and sat down in silence on the\r\ndoorstep.\r\n\r\nIt was now day, and still the priest had not made his appearance. Bart\r\nwondered at this, and attributed it to his oversleeping himself. This\r\nmade him feel somewhat impatient, and he thought hardly of the priest\r\nfor yielding to his drowsiness at such a time as this, when it was a\r\nquestion of life and death; but he waited, and checked a rising impulse\r\nwhich he had to hunt up the priest’s bedroom and wake him. While he\r\nwas fretting and fuming, the two French guides had placidly seated\r\nthemselves on the doorstep in a line with Solomon, and began to smoke,\r\nchatting with one another in French.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Bart heard footsteps behind him. He thought it was the priest,\r\nand turned hastily. It was not the priest, however, but Pat. Bart\r\nhad actually forgotten Pat’s existence ever since that moment on the\r\nprevious evening, when he had gone out doors to look for him, and\r\nhad seen that terrible appearance over the forest trees. As he now\r\nrecognized him, he wondered at his long absence, and noticed at the same\r\ntime that Pat looked very much agitated. At once he thought that Pat had\r\nheard bad news, and had come to tell him. This idea was so terrible that\r\nhe stood paralyzed, and could scarcely utter a word.\r\n\r\nPat came up and gave a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\n“It’s dhreadful--it’s terrible. Och, wurrooooo!” Bart looked at him with\r\nan awful face, not daring to ask the question that was upon his lips,\r\nand now feeling sure that Pat had heard the worst.\r\n\r\n“Och, what’ll we iver do?” cried Pat; “what’ll we iver do? Sure an me\r\nheart’s fairly broke widin me, so it is.”\r\n\r\n“How did you find it out?” asked Bart, in a trembling voice.\r\n\r\n“Sure an wasn’t it the praste himself that tould me,” said Pat, in a\r\ntone of voice that sounded like a wail of despair.\r\n\r\n“The priest?” said Bart. “You saw him then--did you. Where--where is\r\nhe?”\r\n\r\n“The praste,” said Pat, dolefully; “sorra one o’ me knows. I seen him\r\ndhrivin off. I wor sleepin undher a tray behind the fince. I wasn’t goin\r\nto thrust mesilf in their leper houses, so I wasn’t.”\r\n\r\n“You saw him. P--he has gone, has he--gone--to--to--to see about it,”\r\n stammered Bart, feverishly; “and what did he tell you?”\r\n\r\n“Tell me?” said Pat, dubiously.\r\n\r\n“Yes. You said you saw him.”\r\n\r\n“So I did.”\r\n\r\n“Well--what did he say about it?”\r\n\r\n“Sure an he didn’t say anythin jist thin.”\r\n\r\n“But he told you about it, you said.”\r\n\r\n“So he did; but it was last night.”\r\n\r\n“O, in the night--you saw him in the night--he must have been out\r\nthen--and I thought he was in bed. O, why wasn’t I with him? Why didn’t\r\nhe take me? But I suppose he thought I’d be too much overcome, and so he\r\ndidn’t want to tell me--and did he tell you this, Pat? Tell me all. Tell\r\nme all--don’t keep me in suspense.”\r\n\r\nAt these incoherent words Pat stared at Bart in utter amazement, and for\r\na moment thought that he had lost his senses.\r\n\r\n“Suspinse?” he said--“suspinse? What do you mean? You talk as though\r\nyou’d lost your sivin sinsis! Sure an didn’t you hear it yerself, ivery\r\nword? Sure an worn’t ye in the room yourself, listhening? Didn’t ye hear\r\nit all?”\r\n\r\n“Hear it all? Hear what?” cried Bart. “About what?”\r\n\r\n“Why, about the lepers, sure. Sorra a thought I’ve had iver since,\r\nexcept about that same. And I went off, so I did; for I didn’t dare to\r\nslape in that leper house, wid a man that lives among the lepers and\r\nshakes hands wid them.”\r\n\r\n“The lepers!” cried Bart in impatience, but with a feeling of\r\ninexpressible relief--the relief which is felt at a respite, however\r\nbrief, from sorrow. “The lepers! Why, I was talking about Phil. Have you\r\nheard anything about Phil?”\r\n\r\n“Phil?” said Pat. “Arrah, sure he’s all right. I ony wish I wor in his\r\nshoes. It ud be a happy boy I’d be if I cud change places wid Phil. Och,\r\nwurroo--but it’s a bitther day whin I came to this place.”\r\n\r\n“You haven’t heard anything at all about Phil, then?” said Bart.\r\n\r\n“Niver a word,” said Pat. “I’ve heard too much about other things.”\r\n\r\nBart turned away.\r\n\r\nAs for Pat, he wandered disconsolately to the fence by the road side,\r\nand leaning against it, he stood there in a woe-begone attitude,--the\r\nvery picture of despair.\r\n\r\nBart now resumed his melancholy walk; but before he had taken many\r\npaces, he heard the rapid gallop of a horse, and in turning, he saw a\r\nrider approaching the house, who, on drawing nearer, turned out to\r\nbe the priest. Bart now saw that he had done his kind host a great\r\ninjustice in supposing that he had been oversleeping himself, and felt\r\na natural sorrow at his suspicions. As the priest dismounted, the very\r\nfirst words which he addressed to Bart made the compunction of the\r\nlatter over his unjust suspicions still stronger, since they showed\r\nthat, so far from sleeping while Bart was wakeful, in his anxiety over\r\nPhil, he had left Bart in bed, and had been traversing the country for\r\nmiles, in order to institute a general search after the lost boy.\r\n\r\n“I took a few hours’ sleep,” said he, “and rose between one and two.\r\nI’ve been up the road for twelve or fifteen miles, and have persuaded a\r\nnumber of people to make a search of the woods as far as they are able\r\nto. They are all full of the deepest anxiety about the poor lad, and\r\nyou may rest assured that the good people will do all in their power\r\nfor him. My people are not very intellectual, nor are they what you call\r\nprogressive; but they are affectionate, simple-hearted, and brave; and\r\nthere is not one of them that I have spoken to who will have any peace\r\nuntil that poor lad’s fate is decided. So when we go off to search after\r\nhim, you may console yourself with the thought that our party is but one\r\nout of several that are engaged in the same search.”\r\n\r\nAt this disclosure of the real business of the priest, Bart was so\r\novercome with mingled emotions, that he could scarcely say a word. He\r\ncould only murmur some confused expressions of gratitude.\r\n\r\n“O, never mind me,” said the priest, “and my poor efforts. I assure you\r\nI am as eager to find him as you are. Pray to God, my boy. He only can\r\nsave your friend. And now let us set out at once.”\r\n\r\nWith these words the priest hurried up to the two guides, and spoke\r\na few words to them in French. The guides answered, and after a short\r\nconversation the priest went into the house. The guides took his horse\r\nand put him in the stable; and by the time they had returned, the priest\r\ncame out, and they all went off towards the woods.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be discouraged,” said the priest to Bart, “about the fires. After\r\nall, they may have driven your friend away in this direction. For you\r\nsee he would naturally keep as far as possible away from them, and as\r\nthey advanced he would retreat. And so, if they are really coming in\r\nthis direction, he would be forced to come this way too. If so, I think\r\nsome of my friends would be likely to meet with him. The only real\r\ndanger is, that he may be tired out, and be unable to endure the\r\nfatigue. But you say he is an active boy, and that he had a little food\r\nwith him; and so I really think that there is every reason for hope. You\r\nmust try, then, to keep up your spirits, and remember that even if we\r\ndon’t find him he may yet be safe, and may meet with others; or he may\r\neven get out of the woods unassisted.”\r\n\r\nThese words were very encouraging to Bart, and excited his best hopes.\r\nAs he was naturally light-hearted and sanguine, he determined to\r\nstruggle against his depression, and cling as long as possible to the\r\nhopes that the present held out. The consequence was, that he at once\r\nsurmounted his gloom, and dismissed from his mind those desponding\r\nthoughts which had taken possession of him ever since he saw the glow of\r\nthe fire. He became more like his old self, and commenced the exploring\r\ntour, full of life, and energy, and hope.\r\n\r\nFar different was it with Pat. His trouble arose from a dark, dreadful\r\nterror which had taken full possession of him, and which not even his\r\nbuoyancy of soul and natural cheerfulness could withstand. It was the\r\nterror that had been awakened by the mention of the leprosy.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that as the party entered the woods, Pat held back; and\r\nhe who was usually among the first, now lingered the last. He had a\r\nterrible fear that he had run a risk of catching the loathsome disease\r\nby bathing in what he considered the “leper waters,” and by entering\r\nthe house of one who was on such familiar terms with the lepers as the\r\npriest professed to be. It seemed to him, now, that the only possible\r\nchance that remained for him was to keep as far away from the priest as\r\npossible. He remembered with horror that he had eaten at the priest’s\r\nhouse on the preceding evening. He had not eaten anything that morning,\r\nnor had any of them as yet; for the guides carried provisions, and\r\nit was intended to breakfast in the woods. But to Pat all thoughts of\r\neating were obnoxious; the sickening thought of the leprosy drove away\r\nall his appetite; and if he followed them into the woods, it was at a\r\ndistance; and then only because there still remained a loyal regard\r\nfor Phil, and thus the tables were completely turned. Bart, who the day\r\nbefore had been despondent, was now hopeful; while Pat, who had then\r\nbeen the hopeful one, had now sunk down into a state of depression to\r\nwhich language fails to do justice.\r\n\r\nAfter walking into the woods for some distance, they sat down and made\r\na breakfast off some ham and crackers, which were carried by the\r\nguides. Pat sat at a distance from the rest, and resolutely refused all\r\ninvitations to partake, pleading a slight sickness; nor was poor Pat’s\r\nplea altogether a feigned one; for by this time he had worked himself\r\ninto a state of utter panic, and the miserable feelings resulting from\r\nhis loss of a night’s sleep and from hunger were attributed by him to\r\nthe approach of leprosy. So poor Pat stood aloof from the rest, pale,\r\nanxious, and already beginning to think that he had made a great mistake\r\nin accompanying them at all. The more he thought upon this, the more\r\nconvinced did he become that his presence there in company with them was\r\nboth unnecessary and unwise,--unnecessary, for, as it now seemed to him,\r\nPhil was perfectly able to take care of himself; and unwise, for he was\r\nonly destroying his chance of escape from the leprosy, by thus remaining\r\nin the company of those who had its terrible seeds clinging to their\r\nclothes and to their persons.\r\n\r\nA prey thus to his anxiety, Pat’s generous desire to help Phil gradually\r\nweakened in the presence of his instinct of self-preservation, and\r\nhis belief that Phil was safe somewhere made him all the more eager to\r\nsecure safety for himself. The wretchedness which he felt, from the loss\r\nof his night’s rest, and want of food, and terror, all combined, tended\r\nto turn all his thoughts upon himself; and the more wretched he felt,\r\nthe more did he attribute it to the awful disease which he so greatly\r\ndreaded. And so, at last, by the time they had finished their repast,\r\nPat had felt so overcome by his terrors, that he determined, at all\r\nhazards, to free himself from his dangerous associates, and escape\r\nsomewhere before it was too late. Having thus made up his mind, it only\r\nremained to find some favorable opportunity of slipping away unobserved,\r\nand thus securing that safety for which he longed.\r\n\r\nAfter their breakfast they began to go forward. The two guides of course\r\nwent first, one behind the other. Then followed the priest, and after\r\nhim came Bart. Pat wanted Solomon to go next; but Solomon declined,\r\nfrom a feeling of humility natural to him, which made him seek the\r\nlowest--that is to say, the last--place on the line of march, and partly\r\nalso from a desire to be in the rear, so as to see that no one straggled\r\naway. Thus they all went on in Indian file, and after Bart came Pat,\r\nwhile Solomon brought up the rear.\r\n\r\nAs they thus went on, one after the other, in Indian file, through the\r\nwoods, it was, of course, impossible for any one to see all the rest\r\nof the party. It was enough if each one should see the one who might be\r\nimmediately in front. This was especially the case when the woods grew\r\nthicker and the march more laborious. Bart then could only see the\r\npriest; and Pat, Bart; while Solomon could only see Pat. In this way\r\nthey went on then, and this mode of progress soon suggested to Pat a\r\nsimple, easy, and perfectly natural mode of separating himself from the\r\nothers. He had only to slacken his pace a little for a short distance.\r\nHe had only to fall back slightly, and he would easily be able to put\r\nbetween himself and the others such obstacles that they would be able\r\nneither to see him nor to find him. This, now, became his fixed resolve.\r\n\r\nSo, as he went on, Pat allowed Bart to go gradually farther and farther\r\nahead, until at length he was out of sight. But even then he was not\r\nsatisfied. He still kept on, but chose a course which swerved slightly\r\nfrom the one which the others were following; and entering upon this\r\ncourse, he sought to make it more and more apart from the track of the\r\nothers. As he went along he kept constantly turning to the right, and\r\nthus before long he had made a complete circuit; and then, when he\r\nthought he had turned far enough to be heading towards the place from\r\nwhich he set out, he tried to go in a straight line. In all this he was\r\ncompletely successful; that is to say, so far as concerned his desire\r\nnot to be noticed; and so he kept on for so long a time that at length\r\nhe began to be on the lookout for the open land and the sea.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly there was a loud cry behind him,--\r\n\r\n“Hyar, Hyar! you dar! Whar Mas’r Bart?”\r\n\r\nIt was Solomon.\r\n\r\nPat had forgotten all about Solomon; but now he remembered that Solomon\r\nhad been behind him, and he saw that he must have been following him\r\nall the time, though he had been too excited to be conscious of that\r\nimportant fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n_Solomon in a Rage.--Flight of Pat.--The Explorers penetrate the\r\nForest.--The missing Companions.--New Fears and Anxieties.--A baffled\r\nSearch.--Onward.--The Recesses of the Forest.--An open Space.--Halt!_\r\n\r\n\r\nYAR, Hyar! you dar! Whar Mas’r Bart?” The cry at once arrested Pat.\r\nHe stopped short, and turning round he found himself face to face with\r\nSolomon.\r\n\r\n“Whar Mash Bart?” said Solomon again. He was excited and agitated, and\r\nlooked all around, and peered into the forest ahead with most anxious\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n“Bart?” said Pat, in a dejected tone; “sure an I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Warn’t you follerin him?” cried Solomon, in an excited voice.\r\n\r\n“Sure an I wor,” said Pat; “but I lost sight of him iver an iver so long\r\nago. An wheriver he is now, it ud take more’n me to tell.”\r\n\r\nAt this Solomon made a gesture of despair, and looked wildly all around.\r\n\r\n“Mas’r Bart lost! Mas’r Bart lost!” he murmured, clutching his wrinkled\r\nhands together.\r\n\r\n“Och, you needn’t bother about him. Sure an he’s follerin the praste an\r\nthe Frinchmin, an he’s all safe an right. The last time I see him he was\r\nclose on the hails of the praste.”\r\n\r\nSolomon did not seem to have heard him. His eyes rolled wildly. He\r\nlooked all around eagerly, wistfully, with unspeakable anxiety in his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“Mas’r Bart lost! Mas’r Bart lost!” he murmured, still wringing his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“But I till ye he ain’t lost,” cried Pat. “He’s wid the praste, so he\r\nis. Didn’t I see him?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t see no use,” cried Solomon, angrily, “for de likes ob you to go\r\nfoolin round dis yer way, leadin folks eberywhar, out ob de right track.\r\nI bound to foller Mas’r Bart, an heah you go a foolin an a gittin lost.\r\nWhat’s de sense ob dis yer proceedin? What do you mean, anyhow? Ef you\r\ntink I’m goin to stan any such tomfoolery, you precious mistaken. You\r\nbetter begin now and go ahead, and find out whar Mas’r Bart is.”\r\n\r\nSolomon’s tone was full of a certain angry menace, which was so utterly\r\nunlike his usual manner that Pat stared at him in wonder.\r\n\r\n“Ah, howl yer whist,” he exclaimed, at last; “sure I ain’t the only\r\none that’s got lost in these wuds, so I ain’t. You can find him yerself\r\nbether’n me, so ye can, if ye want to. How can I find him! Sorra one of\r\nme knows the way anywheres out of this; and I’m fairly broken-hearted,\r\nso I am, and that’s all about it.”\r\n\r\nAnd saying this, Pat flung himself down, and buried his face in his\r\nhands. He felt overwhelmed by his troubles. His fears of the leprosy\r\nwere still strong within him, and in addition to this he felt a keen\r\nsense of self-reproach at his desertion of Bart. Had it not been for\r\nSolomon he might not have thought of this; but the sight of the old\r\nman’s anxiety about Bart brought before him in the plainest manner the\r\nfact that he had been disloyal to his friend, and had deserted him, in\r\nthis hour of need.\r\n\r\nAs for Solomon, he took only one look at him, and then turned away. In\r\nhis faithful heart there was only one feeling, one desire; and that was,\r\nto get back to Bart. He had no idea of the actual state of the case. He\r\ndid not know what a circuit Pat had made, but merely supposed that they\r\nhad got off the track that the others were following. With this idea\r\nin his mind, he proceeded to call after Bart, so as to open up a\r\ncommunication with him. This he strove to do by means of a series of the\r\nmost unearthly yells, shrieks, and howls that ever echoed through the\r\nrecesses of a harmless and unoffending forest. Yell followed yell; howl\r\nsucceeded howl; and a long series of hoots, halloos, shrieks, whoops,\r\nand hullaballoos followed in swift succession. After each effort Solomon\r\nstood listening attentively, waiting for a response before beginning\r\nagain. But his listening and his waiting were all unavailing, for no\r\nresponse came, and all his unearthly cries only echoed through the dim\r\nforest aisles, without bringing back any answer from the one whom they\r\nwere intended to reach. And no wonder: for by this time Bart was very\r\nfar indeed out of hearing.\r\n\r\nAt last Solomon gave up in utter discouragement. He stood for a time\r\nin deep dejection, and then turned towards Pat, who had all this time\r\nremained in the same attitude, sitting with his head buried in his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“How long ago is it,” asked Solomon, “sence you lost sight ob Mash\r\nBart?”\r\n\r\n“O, iver so long,” said Pat; “more thin an hour, surely.”\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you call?”\r\n\r\n“Sure an how did I know?” said Pat, evasively; “wasn’t I bothered out\r\nof my life, an fairly heart-broke? so I was. An sure an it’s been a bad\r\ntime for us all intirely. Bad luck to the day whin we came out to this\r\nleper place,--an me goin a bathin in the leper wather, an aitin their\r\nleper dinners; the more fool I was for that same. Sure an the praste’s\r\nthe desayver, so he is, for laydin a poor feller in this way.”\r\n\r\nNot one word of this did Solomon understand, nor did he try to\r\nunderstand it. He had other things to think about. His one idea was to\r\nfind Bart once more. He did not think that he was far away, but believed\r\nthat he had been going on in the same general direction, though he had\r\nswerved, to some extent, from the true course. So he now determined to\r\ngo on, and hoped that he might find Bart before long.\r\n\r\n“No use waitin in dis yer place, dis yer way,” said he. “I’m a goin to\r\nhunt up Mas’r Bart.”\r\n\r\nAnd with these words he left Pat, and went onward into the woods,\r\ncontinuing the same course which Pat had been leading. As to asking Pat\r\nto go with him, the thought never entered his head,--partly on account\r\nof his deep disgust at Pat for losing sight, as he believed, of Bart,\r\nbut principally from the fact that his mind was so filled with the\r\ndesire of reaching Bart, that there was no place in it for any thought\r\nof any other person. And so the poor old fellow plunged into the woods,\r\nand took up a course which was about as far away from that in which Bart\r\nwas going as it well could be.\r\n\r\nAt Solomon’s last words Pat raised his head and saw him go. He watched\r\nhim till he was out of sight, with varied emotions. He supposed that\r\nSolomon was now on his way to Tracadie, while believing himself to\r\nbe following after Bart into the depths of the woods. There seemed,\r\ntherefore, no danger before him, and Pat had no fears for his safety.\r\nHad Solomon taken another direction, Pat would probably have told him\r\nall; but as it was, he saw no necessity for doing so. He would get back,\r\nhe thought, in the course of time, to Tracadie, and on finding himself\r\nthere, he would probably wait for Bart’s return, and all would be well.\r\n\r\nHe sat there motionless, until Solomon was out of sight, and then began\r\nto think of himself. One thing only was in his mind, and that was, the\r\ndesire to fly, as soon as possible, far away from this abhorrent place,\r\nto some other place, where he might be safe, and where he could watch to\r\nsee if the terrible disease had really taken hold of him or not. So with\r\nthis purpose he arose, and after a look all around, he chose his course,\r\nand went on through the woods.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the others had been walking diligently onward; first the\r\nguides leading the way, next the priest, and then Bart. Not a word was\r\nspoken by any one of them; the guides were too intent upon maintaining\r\na correct course; the priest was too much absorbed in watching the\r\nmovements of the guides, and in observing the scenes through which he\r\nwas passing; and Bart was too much occupied with conjectures about the\r\nprobable course of Phil’s wanderings to think anything about the members\r\nof their own party. Bart had a perfect conviction that Pat and Solomon\r\nwere behind him; so perfect, in fact, that it remained in his mind as\r\na foundation underlying all his other thoughts; so perfect that those\r\nthoughts never reverted to those behind him, but turned only to that one\r\nwho was at a distance--the object of their present search.\r\n\r\nDeeper and deeper, and farther and farther, they advanced into the\r\nforest, encountering every variation of woodland scenery, and every\r\nalternation of forest travelling; sometimes finding it easy, again\r\nfinding it difficult, yet at no time encountering any very serious\r\nobstacle. Their pace was somewhat rapid, for the guides led them on\r\nwithout much regard to the possible weakness or clumsiness of their\r\nfollowers; and judging them by themselves, they maintained a pace which\r\nsoon began to tell very seriously upon Bart, and forced him to put forth\r\nhis utmost strength and energy in order to keep the priest in sight.\r\n\r\nAt last, after a walk of several hours, the guides stopped, and offered\r\nto rest. They were coming, they said, upon a more difficult part of the\r\nforest, where greater exertion would be required, and it might be well\r\nto rest for a time. The priest approved of this, and mentioned it to\r\nBart. He also approved of it most heartily, for he was almost exhausted,\r\nand then turned to mention it to Pat. To his surprise, however, Pat was\r\nnot behind him, nor was there any sign of Solomon.\r\n\r\nThis discovery gave him a great shock, and the priest also was equally\r\namazed; but both he and Bart supposed that they could not be far\r\naway, and so they looked back through the woods to gain sight of their\r\nadvancing figures. Not perceiving any signs of them, they listened to\r\nfind out if they were approaching. No sounds, however, arose of any\r\nkind; no crackle of dry twigs announced coming footsteps; and as they\r\nlistened, there was nothing perceptible to their hearing save the\r\nintense and drear silence of a vast solitude.\r\n\r\nAt this Bart threw a look of anxious inquiry at the priest.\r\n\r\n“They were following you?” said the priest, in an inquiring tone.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bart, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“Have you noticed that they fell back?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t notice them at all. I took it for granted all the time that\r\nthey were behind me.”\r\n\r\n“How long is it since you saw them last?”\r\n\r\n“Well, really, I don’t believe I have looked behind me once since we\r\nstarted.”\r\n\r\n“I hope they haven’t lost sight of us. I hope they haven’t lost their\r\nway,” said the priest.\r\n\r\nThe evident anxiety of his tone affected Bart very seriously. His own\r\nexperience in the woods, as well as the loss of Phil, made him quite\r\nready to believe the worst; and though it puzzled him greatly to\r\nconceive how Pat and Solomon could quietly lose them, and go off on a\r\nstrange course, without a single word, at the same time he began to fear\r\nthat such must have been the case.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the priest, “we may as well sit down and rest. There’s\r\nnothing else to be done. Perhaps they’ll be along presently. I’ll make\r\nthe guides call for them. They can do it better than we can.”\r\n\r\nHe then spoke to the guides; and the latter, as soon as they understood\r\nthe state of the case, began to call for their lost companions. They did\r\nthis by setting up a series of cries so loud, so shrill, and so sharp,\r\nthat Bart actually started. He had never in all his life heard such\r\nsounds. Pitched upon a high and very peculiar key, they seemed to have\r\na far-penetrating power which would suffice to carry them for an\r\nincredible distance.\r\n\r\nAgain and again the guides uttered these cries, and after each cry they\r\nlistened; but though they listened long, there came not the slightest\r\nresponse. At length, at a suggestion from the priest, one of them went\r\nback along the track which they had traversed. He returned after about\r\nhalf an hour. He came back alone, and reported that he had seen no sign\r\nwhatever of either of those who were lost.\r\n\r\nThe priest now looked worried and uneasy. He sat for some time in\r\nsilence, thinking over this fresh difficulty.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, at length, “they seem to have lost us--most\r\nmysteriously; and now the only question is, shall we go back to try to\r\nfind them, or shall we go on? Which needs our help most, the one who has\r\nbeen lost for two or three days, or those who have just left us?”\r\n\r\n“O, as to that,” said Bart, “they are both better able to take care\r\nof themselves than Phil is; and besides, they are nearer to the\r\nsettlements, and they must know the way back, for the woods have not\r\nbeen very thick, and we have been going in a straight course, and so it\r\nseems to me that we had better go on and try to find poor Phil.”\r\n\r\n“I think so too,” said the priest. “At any rate we shall rest for an\r\nhour yet, and perhaps before we start they will find us.”\r\n\r\nThey remained for an hour longer, but there was no sign of the lost\r\nones. No sound of crackling twigs, no calls for help, awakened the deep\r\nsilence that reigned in the surrounding forest.\r\n\r\nAt length they rose to resume their journey in accordance with Bart’s\r\ndecision. This new calamity broke up that cheerfulness and hopefulness\r\nwhich he had been maintaining since the priest had spoken to him those\r\nencouraging words; and the thought of Pat and Solomon wandering about,\r\nwithout food and without guides through this trackless forest, gave him\r\nmore than his former anxiety. It seemed a succession of misfortunes that\r\nwas destined to end in some kind of a tragedy, and there arose within\r\nhis mind the dark anticipation of some inevitable calamity as the\r\nnatural termination of all these pieces of ill-fortune.\r\n\r\nStruggling as well as he could with these gloomy forebodings, Bart once\r\nmore set out after his guides on what he now began to think a hopeless\r\nerrand. But now there came other things to distract his mind from the\r\nanxieties that were harassing it in the shape of the difficulties of\r\nthe way. The guides were right in their warning about the toil and labor\r\nthat now lay before them. There were dense underbrushes to penetrate--so\r\ndense and so close that every step was a struggle; there were streams\r\nto ford, in which they sank to the armpits; there were swamps to cross,\r\nwhere there was nothing but one long struggle from one extremity to the\r\nother; and added to this there were long pathways that led over fallen\r\ntrees, and through tangled weeds, and tall ferns, which impeded the\r\nfeet at every step, and necessitated the most painful and the most\r\nunremittent exertion. In his progress through the woods before, Bart had\r\nfound nothing like this, except for very short periods of time, and\r\nhe thought that if such a journey as this had been before him he could\r\nnever have escaped.\r\n\r\nThus far the heat had been very great. There was no wind. The air was\r\nstill and stagnant; and the effort of walking, even when the walk\r\nhad been easy, as at first, had been somewhat exhaustive. But now the\r\nexertion required was far greater, and what was worse, the heat far\r\nmore intense. There was a torrid heat in the atmosphere that exceeded\r\nanything which he had thus far experienced, and made all exertion doubly\r\ntoilsome and exhaustive. Yet in spite of all this, his deep anxiety\r\nabout Phil seemed to sustain him, and though he felt ready to drop, yet\r\nhe managed to maintain his march, and follow on after his guides.\r\n\r\nAt length they emerged from a tangled thicket which had offered\r\nextraordinary obstacles to their progress. They came suddenly into a\r\nwide, open place, quite bare of trees, and overgrown with low brush and\r\ntrailing evergreen vines. Here there burst upon them an extraordinary\r\nsight,--so extraordinary, indeed, that they all stopped with one common\r\nimpulse, and gazed in silence upon the scene before them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n_The wide open Space.--The terrific Scene.--Arrested and driven\r\nback.--New Purposes.--The Story of the Great Fire of Miramichi, and the\r\nRuin wrought in one tremendous Night._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE wide open space upon which they had come extended for some miles\r\naway on the right and on the left. About a mile off on the other side\r\narose the trees of the forest again. Above these the smoke was rolling\r\nin vast, dense, voluminous clouds, while underneath them shone the red\r\nglare of a mighty conflagration. It was in those very woods which rose\r\nbefore them. They could see and feel its terrible presence. They could\r\nsee, behind the line of trees that stood nearest, the dash of the\r\nsurging flames as they seized upon the dry foliage and resinous wood\r\nof the forest; and the angry glow of the red fire, as, following the\r\nadvance of the flame, it grasped and held in its blighting, withering\r\nembrace all that it seized upon. At the breath of the flame the forest\r\nshrank away; at the touch of the fire it crumbled into dust.\r\n\r\nThe foremost line of trees stood there, black against the glow of\r\nthe fire that raged behind, like the bars of some vast, immeasurable\r\nfurnace. Beneath, behind those bars, gleamed the fire; overhead rose the\r\nsmoke, spreading over the sky, and filling all the air with its hot and\r\nsuffocating fumes.\r\n\r\nThe whole party stood there looking on in silence. The guides conversed\r\nwith one another and with the priest in French, of which Bart understood\r\nnothing. By the expression of their faces, and by the shaking of their\r\nheads, however, he learned,--if indeed he did not know well enough\r\nalready,--that any farther progress in that direction was impossible.\r\n\r\n“What do they say?” asked he at length of the priest.\r\n\r\n“Well, of course, you see yourself,” said the priest, “that it’s\r\nimpossible to go any farther, and consequently we must give up the idea\r\nof reaching that part of the forest where your friend was lost.”\r\n\r\n“What shall we do?” exclaimed Bart, in deep distress.\r\n\r\n“Well, that is what we are thinking of now. It all depends upon whether\r\nyour friend has come in this direction or not. Now, you came in this\r\ndirection, and you must have been within a few miles of this place; but\r\nyou reached Tracadie safely, and saw no fire.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bart, “only smoke.”\r\n\r\n“But you must have been near it, for you saw the flames last evening.\r\nThey were concealed by the trees when you were in the woods. Besides,\r\nthe fire has, no doubt, been spreading in this direction ever since.\r\nNow, as for your friend, if he came in this direction at all, he may\r\nhave reached a place to the north of the fire, and I am of the opinion\r\nthat we might go in that direction. We shall thus see something of the\r\nother parties that are searching the woods up there. In fact there is\r\nnothing else to be done. If we don’t find him farther to the north, then\r\nI shall take it for granted that he has wandered in another direction\r\naltogether, and perhaps may come out at the Bay de Chaleur.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t think, then, that there is--reason for despair?”\r\n\r\n“Despair? Certainly not. Why should there be?”\r\n\r\n“O, I don’t know. I was afraid that this fire extended everywhere, like\r\nthe great fire that once raged here.”\r\n\r\n“The great fire? O, no. Such a thing as that can only take place once\r\nin centuries. That was the result of a combination of circumstances so\r\nextraordinary, that it is not likely that they will ever occur again.\r\nAnd just now, such a fire as that is a simple impossibility.”\r\n\r\n“But this fire seems pretty bad,” said Bart, “and it’s certainly\r\nincreasing.”\r\n\r\n“This fire? O, this is nothing,” said the priest.\r\n\r\n“In these woods, there is a fire somewhere every summer,--and it runs on\r\ntill a rain shower comes. This is only a local affair, confined to this\r\nparticular district. It may possibly extend for ten or twelve miles, and\r\nhave a width of two or three miles. It is troublesome, and you perceive\r\nthe heat in the air, and it sends out smoke for many miles; but there is\r\nnothing in it that is at all extraordinary. There is nothing in it that\r\na man cannot escape from. It is not like the swift and hurricane speed\r\nof the great fire, that swept in one night through all this country,\r\nand made one vast waste of ashes and death before morning. O, no. As for\r\nyour friend, he ought to be able to get along; and every brook that he\r\ncomes to will give him fish to eat. It’s the greatest country for trout\r\nand salmon in the world. In fact, I don’t see the slightest cause for\r\nanxiety about him.”\r\n\r\nThese words gave Bart a relief that was inexpressible, and he was now\r\nfreed from the terrible anxiety that had so long devoured him. The\r\nopinion of the priest was of great value, for he, no doubt, knew\r\nperfectly well just what danger there might be. His estimation of the\r\nfire afforded still greater relief. Bart had feared that it was some\r\nuniversal conflagration; but it now turned out to be a local affair, so\r\ncommonplace that no one here regarded it.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said the priest, “that we had better go back at once.”\r\n\r\n“Go back?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“To Tracadie.”\r\n\r\n“But I thought we were going to search farther for Phil--to the north.”\r\n\r\n“So we are,” said the priest; “but we’ll have to go back. If we were to\r\nwalk through the woods, we would only be losing time. Now, I propose to\r\ngo back, and drive along the road to a place about fifteen miles away,\r\nwhere some men are already in the woods engaged in this search. We can\r\neither go there, or go farther on; in fact, it might be well to go as\r\nfar as the Bay de Chaleur, and get people there to keep a lookout. But\r\nfirst, we must go back, and we can see what the prospects are.”\r\n\r\nThey now retraced their steps in accordance with what the priest had\r\nsaid. It was a deep disappointment to Bart to find himself returning\r\nagain without having accomplished anything; and in addition to this, he\r\nwas very greatly troubled by the disappearance of Pat and Solomon. By\r\nthe time they reached Tracadie it was evening, and as nothing more could\r\nbe done that night, Bart once more took up his quarters for the night\r\nwith the priest.\r\n\r\nWhile sitting together that evening, the conversation was very naturally\r\ndrawn to the great fire, of which the priest had already spoken several\r\ntimes; and at Bart’s request he now gave a more particular account of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“It was in the year 1825,” said the priest. “The summer had been the\r\nhottest and the dryest ever known, not only in this province, but all\r\nover North America. There was no rain for months. The hay crop was\r\na total failure everywhere, and the garden vegetables all wilted and\r\nwithered. Corn, turnips, potatoes, almost everything failed. The roads\r\nwere all covered with fine dust, the fields were all cracked, and the\r\ngrass was as if it had been scorched. The woods were dried and parched\r\nin the same way, the sap seemed to dry up in the trees, and the leaves\r\nand branches were ready to flash into a blaze at the slightest approach\r\nof fire.\r\n\r\n“Fires, indeed, were in the woods in different places from midsummer\r\ntill autumn. These burned steadily, though without making any very great\r\nprogress. There were fires in these woods, and up at the head of the\r\nbay, and near the Nashwaak. The most extensive was one near Fredericton.\r\nThere were also fires in the woods of Maine. And in Canada some of them\r\nhad reached very serious dimensions. As a general thing, none of our\r\npeople thought anything of it. Fires are so common that they excite no\r\nattention, and so it was with us. It was so dry that there was every\r\nreason to expect them, and if they were even larger than usual, that was\r\nno more than might be expected under such unusual circumstances.\r\n\r\n“At last the month of October came, and in the early part of that\r\nmonth various causes contributed to spread the fires. On the 6th it was\r\nnoticed that they had increased very greatly, and their extent was now\r\nfar beyond anything that had ever been known before. People wondered\r\nat this, but thought that before long it must come to an end. Rain must\r\ncome and put a stop to it.\r\n\r\n“On the following day, the 7th, it was far worse. All through the\r\npreceding night the fires had been extending everywhere, and when day\r\ncame it had an appearance different from anything ever known before.\r\nThe sky had a deep purple tint, and immense clouds of black smoke rolled\r\nover the whole heavens. There was not a breath of wind, but everything\r\nwas sunk into a calm so deep and profound that it seemed like the death\r\nof Nature. The heat was suffocating, the air thick and stagnant, so that\r\nbreathing was difficult. No one could put forth the slightest exertion.\r\nEverybody lay about in a state of utter lassitude and listlessness,\r\nor tried in vain to find some cool place where the heat might be less\r\noppressive.\r\n\r\n“The most wonderful thing was the effect of all this upon the lower\r\nanimals. The birds had all fled. The cattle in the fields seemed\r\nbewildered and terrified. They collected in groups, lowing piteously,\r\nand looking wildly around, eating nothing, but standing as though\r\nparalyzed. The dogs moaned, and crouched, and wandered restlessly out of\r\ndoors and back again. But what was yet more astonishing was the behavior\r\nof the wild animals. Wolves, and bears, and hares, and foxes came from\r\nthe woods to the open places, overcome with terror, and seeking refuge\r\namong the domestic animals.\r\n\r\n“In spite of all this the people did not show much excitement. In the\r\nmore lonely places they may have been frightened, but in the settlements\r\nthey seemed simply listless. No one anticipated the terror that was\r\napproaching, or had any idea of the doom impending over the whole\r\ncountry. Strangely enough, the instinct of the lower animals was truer\r\nthan the reason of man. As the fire was not yet visible, the people in\r\nthe settlements made no preparations against it, nor did they even think\r\nthat preparations were necessary. They knew, of course, that the heat\r\nand the unusual appearances were produced by fires in some place, but\r\nwhere it was, or how near it might be, they did not think.\r\n\r\n“Evening came on, and at about seven o’clock a brisk wind suddenly\r\nsprang up. The sun set, and the darkness was intense beyond all\r\ndescription. And in that darkness nothing whatever was visible; there\r\nwas something terrible beyond words in such deep gloom; but the wind\r\nwent on and increased to a wilder degree, until at last it blew with\r\nextraordinary violence. Now, through the darkness a terrible sight\r\nbecame visible. All over the west and towards the north-west there shone\r\na red glow, which grew brighter and brighter, until at last the whole\r\nskies were lightened up with flaming fires. The wind increased, coming\r\nfrom the west, until at length it blew a perfect hurricane; fiercer,\r\nmore furious, more terrible than any in the memory of the oldest\r\ninhabitants here. Driven on by this fierce tempest, the fires spread\r\nwith inconceivable rapidity, and all the west became a sea of fire, and\r\nabove the woods vast flames shot up, furiously, far into the sky. There\r\nwas no darkness now. It was driven away, and light had come; but the\r\nlight was worse than the darkness had been.\r\n\r\n“The hurricane increased, and the fires drove onward before it, and the\r\nfierce flames towered far up into the sky. Then there came a low moan\r\nfrom afar, which increased, and strengthened, and deepened, until at\r\nlast it grew to a loud, appalling roar--a roar like sustained thunder,\r\nwhich still grew louder, and deeper, and nearer, and more awful. In the\r\nmidst of this came the sound of crackling, like musketry volleys, and\r\nloud, tremendous explosions, like the discharge of cannon. And all this\r\nincreased every minute, the fires sweeping onward more terribly, the\r\nroar of its advance gathering in intensity and volume, until at last the\r\nvast sheets of flame seemed to rise almost to the zenith. Overhead all\r\nthe black smoke was now reddened in the glow of the fire, and there\r\npassed away over the sky a fierce torrent, bearing with it innumerable\r\nsparks, and blazing twigs, and branches of trees, which had been torn\r\nfrom the forest by the fire, and were now hurled through the air by the\r\nhurricane.\r\n\r\n“Now there arose the wildest panic. All had been so sudden that there\r\nhad been no time for thought--but even if there had been time, no\r\nthought could have availed. There was only one common impulse in all\r\nliving things, whether man or beast, and that was escape. One cry only\r\narose--the cry, ‘To the river! To the river!’ In this direction every\r\none hurried, a confused crowd,--men, women, children, horses, cows,\r\nand dogs,--some carrying the old or the sick, others assisting the weak;\r\nfathers carrying their children, mothers their infants. Each seized what\r\nwas most precious, and fled. All the time there were wild outcries--some\r\nof fear, others of hope, others of command, others of despair from some\r\nwho had been separated from relatives, and were trying to find them\r\nagain. Then they all hurried to the river; and some stood plunged in the\r\nwater, others sought boats, others rafts, others floated on logs, while\r\nothers sought the opposite shore, from which, however, the fires that\r\nspread even there soon drove them.\r\n\r\n“And now the whole country, in all directions, blazed. The whole forest\r\nwas as dry as tinder, and everywhere the floating sparks would fall upon\r\nthe trees, and there would kindle fresh flames, which would sweep\r\naway before the hurricane like those behind. It was this that made the\r\nconflagration so swift and so universal.\r\n\r\n“The morning at length came after that night of horror--the morning of\r\nthe 8th of October; and never did human eye rest upon such a scene\r\nof desolation. The vast forests, the green meadows, the flourishing\r\nvillages, the pleasant homes which a few hours before had formed one of\r\nthe happiest countries in the world, was now one vast expanse of dust\r\nand ashes, out of which lowered the smouldering, blackened shafts of\r\ngiant pine trees that had not been all consumed. The half-burned corpses\r\nof men, women, and children, cattle and wild beasts, strewed the\r\nforests, and in the dried-up beds of brooks and rivers lay the blackened\r\nbodies of burnt fishes. Six thousand square miles had been suddenly\r\nblasted by that unparalleled fire. And all this ruin had been wrought on\r\nthat one night of horror.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the priest’s narrative of one of the most terrible fires on\r\nrecord--the great fire of Miramichi; a fire most remarkable for\r\nthe astonishing rapidity of its course, and the thoroughness of its\r\ndevastation. For, apart from other more immediate evils, it ruined the\r\ntimber of all that country, turned fertile districts into barren wastes,\r\nand annihilated in one night all the resources of a great commerce.\r\n\r\nTo all this Bart listened with deep attention, and gained from it\r\nincreased hope for Phil. For now he saw how different was this fire\r\nfrom the one of which he had been hearing, and how different the\r\ncircumstances were. These woods were not dried like tinder, nor was it\r\npossible for a fire to spread so fast but that any living being could\r\nescape it. Besides, the woods were full of brooks and streams, and all\r\nthese streams were full of fish; and Phil had his rod and lines, and\r\nwas an expert fisherman. From all these thoughts he drew hope and\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nHe was greatly puzzled, however, by the disappearance of Pat and\r\nSolomon. Their departure in the woods had greatly perplexed him, but he\r\nhoped that he would find them on his return to Tracadie. There were no\r\nsigns of them. The night passed, but they did not make their appearance.\r\nMorning came, but brought them not.\r\n\r\nHe did not know what to think about it, and felt perplexed. Still he had\r\nno anxiety. Neither Pat nor Solomon was likely to come to any trouble in\r\nthe woods, for they were perfectly well able to take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nThe party was now all broken up and scattered--Phil, Pat, Solomon, and\r\nBart, all in different directions, and none of them knowing where the\r\nothers were. But Bart’s mind was now intent upon finding Phil; and so,\r\nafter a hurried breakfast, he got into the wagon with the priest, and\r\nthey both drove off together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\n_Phil awakes.--A morning Bath and a morning Repast.--A pleasant\r\nDiscovery.--Once more upon the Move.--The rough, impenetrable\r\nWoods.--The River.--A new Mode of Travel.--The friendly Log.--I’m\r\nafloat, I’m afloat.--Arrested.--The secret Place of Fire._\r\n\r\n\r\nALL that night Phil slept most soundly in the little rocky chamber\r\nwhere he had made his bed; and early on the following morning he waked\r\nand crawled forth. It had been much cooler inside that little cavern\r\nthan outside, and he was very much refreshed; but on emerging into the\r\nouter world, he was at once sensible that the heat of the atmosphere was\r\nmost oppressive. The smoke, too, was thicker now than ever. Overhead it\r\nwas darker, and descended nearer to the ground; while the smell of the\r\nair was more irritating to the throat and nostrils. Everything showed\r\nhim, most plainly, either that the fires were increasing, or were\r\nsteadily drawing nearer to where he was. In either case, the prospect\r\nwas sufficiently unpleasant to make him look forward with uneasiness to\r\nhis future; for as he could see nothing at any distance ahead, and as he\r\nwas still in ignorance of the direction which he ought to take, he was\r\nquite incapable of forming any definite plan of escape, and could only\r\nadhere to his former plan of following the course of the river.\r\n\r\nOn finding out the heat of the atmosphere, his first impulse was to\r\nprepare himself for the toils of the day by a bath, which he proceeded\r\nat once to take. The water was still cool; and the rushing torrent,\r\nas it passed over his head and dashed against his limbs, gave him a\r\ndelicious sense of enjoyment. Then followed his breakfast. The fish\r\nwhich he had saved for the night before were used for this purpose. He\r\nkindled a fire close by his rock, and cooked them upon the coals\r\nwith his usual success. While eating his fish, he noticed at a little\r\ndistance some shrubbery that seemed strangely familiar, and suggested\r\nthe idea of a luxurious addition to his repast. He at once went towards\r\nthem, and found that his surmise was correct. They were blackberry\r\nbushes, and were filled with berries, in such numbers that in a very\r\nshort time he had picked as much as a quart. These he caught in some\r\nstrips of bark folded so as to make a dish, and with this addition\r\nto his provisions he returned to his former station, and finished his\r\nbreakfast with uncommon relish and enjoyment.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing his repast he waited for some time, trying to think upon\r\nwhat might be his best course of action through the day. The more he\r\ntried, however, the more unable he found himself to devise anything\r\nbetter than that which he had been doing; and so at length, finding any\r\nfurther thought useless, he determined to set out on his daily tramp,\r\nleaving his course to be determined by the events of the day.\r\n\r\nHis course was at first precisely like what it had been on the previous\r\nday. Dark pine trees arose all about him, standing at intervals\r\nsufficiently wide to allow of easy progress, their innumerable shafts\r\nrising on every side as far as the eye could reach. The shadow of the\r\nforest beneath caught a peculiar leaden tinge from the smoke that now\r\nsurrounded everything, and in some places was so dark that it seemed as\r\nthough the fire might be smouldering there. There was no underbrush of\r\nany consequence, so that Phil could go on whatever course he pleased;\r\nand as the ground was firm and hard, his progress was made without undue\r\neffort. Thus he was able to keep the river in sight, and follow its\r\ncourse for a long distance.\r\n\r\nAs he went on the brook grew gradually larger, and at length ran into a\r\nstream very much larger than itself, large enough, in fact, to deserve\r\nthe name of river. This Phil saw with delight; for he saw in this the\r\nhope of encountering the haunts of men. As he looked down the course of\r\nthis river, which here afforded a much wider opening in the forest than\r\nhe had yet seen, he was struck by the density of the smoke clouds, and\r\nthe peculiar character of the atmosphere. The sight inspired him with\r\nfar stronger fears than any which he had hitherto known. Thus far he had\r\nconsidered the fire as arising from some one spot, and had thought of\r\nbeing able to evade it, even if he should reach the place where it might\r\nbe burning; but now he began to feel as though the fires were all around\r\nhim, rolling forward from every side towards him, and sending an advance\r\nmarch of smoke to bewilder him and lead him astray. This thought gave\r\nhim a momentary pang, and a transitory feeling of despair crossed his\r\nmind. But this weakness was only short-lived. It soon passed, and his\r\nbuoyancy of soul and sanguine temperament reasserted themselves.\r\n\r\nAt length, as he went along by the river side, he noticed, to his deep\r\nregret, that the pine woods ended, and were succeeded by a forest like\r\nthat which he had traversed on the first day of his wandering. What was\r\nworse, it could not be avoided. He could not walk along the river bank,\r\nfor it was lined with trees and shrubbery. He could not walk in its bed,\r\nfor it was too deep. There was therefore nothing left to do but to make\r\nhis way through the woods the best way that he could.\r\n\r\nOn entering these woods, the change was unpleasant in the extreme. It\r\nwas necessary for him to keep near the river, and in order to do this\r\nhe had to encounter without shrinking all the obstacles that lay in his\r\nway. He did not dare now to attempt to go round any of them, or to make\r\nshort cuts, for he was afraid that if he got out of sight of the water\r\nonce, he would never be able to find it again; and, therefore, at all\r\nhazards, and at every cost, he determined to keep it within sight.\r\n\r\nThese new efforts soon exhausted him, and he was forced to sit down and\r\ntry to recover himself. As he sat there gasping, there seemed to be\r\na more intense warmth in the air, a dry, torrid heat, a suffocating\r\ncloseness, which was, far worse than it had been yet. He felt that under\r\nthese circumstances his progress would be small indeed. He had only one\r\nthought now, and that was, to recover from his heat and exhaustion; and\r\nto do this he knew of only one thing, which was--a plunge in the water.\r\n\r\nTearing off his clothes now, he flung himself in the water, and felt\r\nonce more its reviving influence. At this moment a new idea occurred to\r\nhim, which filled him again with hope. It was, that he should remain in\r\nthe river, and go on as he was, carrying his clothes with him. At this\r\nrate his progress would be far more rapid than it had just been; and he\r\nwould be far less liable to feel fatigue. Acting upon this suggestion,\r\nhe rolled his clothes up into as small a bundle as possible, but kept\r\nhis boots on his feet, so as to walk without difficulty over the sharp\r\nsticks or stones that he might encounter; and now, slinging his bundle\r\nbehind his back, he went on, walking near one of the banks, in water\r\nthat was about up to his waist. His progress was certainly not very\r\nfast; but the plan was highly satisfactory, since he no longer suffered\r\nso much from that intense exhaustion to which he had been subject while\r\nforcing his way through the tangled brushwood. But at length he found\r\nhimself assailed by myriads of mosquitos, and this infliction became so\r\nintolerable that he had to go into the deeper water of the mid-channel.\r\nHere, however, his progress was slow, and carrying his bundle was a\r\ngreat trouble.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he saw a log lying near the shore, entangled among the\r\nbrushwood. It was of cedar, and looked as though it had been cut for a\r\ntelegraph pole. This at once offered him an easy and agreeable mode of\r\nprogress, which was in every possible way superior to anything that he\r\nhad yet tried. Walking towards it, he drew it out, and then placing it\r\nbefore him he bound his bundle upon it. He now pushed it in front\r\nof him, down the stream, and clinging to it, he struck out after it,\r\nsometimes swimming, sometimes walking. So buoyant was the log that\r\nit easily sustained his weight; and the complete success of this\r\ncontrivance made Phil determine to make the rest of his journey in this\r\nway. So he once more stopped, and taking off his boots, bound them upon\r\nthe log also. He was now divested of all his clothing, keeping on only\r\nhis hat, which was useful both against the heat and the flies; and thus\r\nprepared, he once more pushed his log before him, and seeking the centre\r\nof the stream, began to move slowly down. The water here was now over\r\nhis head; and the current was running at the rate of about three miles\r\nan hour. A very slight effort on his part served to increase his motion\r\nto a rate which was faster than any which he had been able to make yet;\r\nand he found himself going onward in a way in which he was able at once\r\nto secure both speed and coolness.\r\n\r\nThe musquitos were troublesome from time to time, but not continuously;\r\nand these he was able to evade by plunging his head under, hat and all,\r\nafter which plunge the drip of the water from his hat about his head\r\nseemed both to cool him and to repel his assailants.\r\n\r\nHe now floated along, and was thus borne onward by the river, with\r\nmany a turn and winding, amidst the forest. On either side arose the\r\ntrees,--dark, solemn, and silent, for not a sound of any kind could be\r\nheard. The birds which usually made the forest vocal with their melody\r\nhad fled to other places. In that torrid and smoky atmosphere there was\r\nno place for these children of song. Phil, as he floated in the cool\r\ncurrent of the river, felt himself withdrawn completely from the heat\r\nand the smoke; but as he looked up he saw enough to make him feel\r\ngrateful that he was where he was--that he had found a stream deep\r\nenough to sustain him in its waters, and swift enough to carry him\r\nonward without any severe exertion on his part. The smoke lowered darkly\r\nand menacingly overhead, and before him, where the river ran, it seemed\r\naccumulated in gloomier and denser masses. The air seemed even hotter,\r\nand as he at times plunged his head under the waters, he rejoiced to\r\nthink that he had so near him such a perpetual remedy for heat and\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\nHe had now been in the stream for some hours, when at length he noticed\r\na rising ground before him. It was a hill of no very great height,\r\nrounded and covered with trees; but behind this there seemed to be an\r\nagitation among the smoke clouds, as though there was concealed there\r\nthe unseen cause of all these stifling vapors that filled the skies.\r\nThis place Phil began to watch with deep interest and curiosity. He did\r\nnot feel fear, for in his present position he did not anticipate any\r\ndanger; but he expected that at this place he would reach what might be\r\nthe climax of his adventures. The only real fear that he had was, not\r\nfrom fire, but from the water itself. He was apprehensive that he might\r\ncome to a cataract, or to rapids. This danger certainly did not seem\r\nvery imminent, or very probable, for the country was generally of too\r\nlevel a character to allow of waterfalls; but Phil thought of this as\r\nhis only possible danger, and was consequently always on the lookout.\r\nNow, therefore, as he saw this accumulation of clouds, and the\r\nagitation that prevailed there, he did not perceive anything that could\r\nimmediately affect him, and so he felt no terror.\r\n\r\nThe river had a winding course; and though it drew nearer and nearer\r\nto this hill, yet it approached it slowly, and by gradual advances. At\r\nlength, on taking a turn round one of its bends, Phil could see that\r\nthe hill was on the left bank, and that he would soon reach it, and\r\npass round it in the next turn of the stream. Full of curiosity, he now\r\ndrifted along, and waited for the next prospect that would be opened up\r\nbehind the hill.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer Phil approached, and stronger and stronger did\r\nhis excited curiosity grow. The smoke, as he drew closer, was more\r\ndistinctly revealed, rising into the skies in dark, rolling masses, as\r\nthough sent up by some mighty power beneath. Nearer and nearer he came,\r\nand at length became aware of short, dull flashes of light, which,\r\nbrightening for a moment, were soon obscured. It did not surprise him,\r\nfor this was in some degree what he was expecting. Where there is smoke\r\nthere must be fire; and if now the flames flashed forth, it merely\r\nproved that he was at last drawing near to that fire whose signs had\r\nfilled the air for many days. And what should he see? What was it that\r\ncould produce this veil of smoke that obscured the universal sky? Could\r\nit be near the haunts of men, and was it merely the commonplace process\r\nof clearing land? No; he felt that it could not be anything so ordinary\r\nas this. The signs which he had seen and felt for days arose from\r\nsomething more than the clearing of fields for cultivation. It was\r\nrather the march of a mighty conflagration through the forest, which\r\ndevoured all things in its path, swept away the verdant trees, blackened\r\nand devastated the rich forest foliage, and sent afar in all directions\r\nthe breath of its devastating mouth.\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts Phil drifted on, awaiting the disclosure of the\r\ngreat fire, and at length reached the hill. Past this he was slowly\r\nborne by the current which encircled it, and then, completing the\r\ncircuit, swept onward upon its course.\r\n\r\nHere, as Phil floated looking forward, the whole scene burst at once\r\nupon his sight. No obstacle any longer rose between him and the fire; he\r\nsaw it in its reality--living and breathing before his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe river went on for about a half mile, and then took another turn.\r\nHalf way between this hill and the next bend rose the flames of a vast\r\nconflagration, devouring the forest far and wide, extending on both\r\nsides of the river to the right and to the left. From Phil’s position\r\nhe could not command any extensive view on either side, and, indeed, the\r\nsmoke would have prevented that had he even been more elevated; but\r\nthe scene before him was enough to convince him of the magnitude of\r\nthe fire. Immediately in front, beginning from that point, lying midway\r\nbetween him and the next bend, the fires began, and extended till the\r\nriver turned again upon its next circuit. On both sides of the stream\r\nthe fires blazed up, and continued far away, reddening in the glow of\r\na mighty conflagration. In the midst of this arose innumerable trees,\r\nstanding up, black, blighted, and withered in the red fire; while over\r\nthem the smoke leaped and rolled as it bounded upward. Nearer, the fires\r\nwere brighter, for here they were incessantly advancing to attack new\r\ntrees: and the flames could be seen darting, like lightning, upward\r\nfrom twig to twig, and from bough to bough, until tree after tree was\r\nenveloped in the raging fire. These were the cause of those flashes\r\nwhich he had noticed further up the stream, and indicated the advance of\r\nthe fire in this direction. The foreground was thus most brilliant, most\r\nactive, and most thrilling; but the background, with its innumerable\r\narray of blackened trunks rising from the midst of that dull, angry fire\r\nglow, and surrounded by the dark smoke clouds, formed a scene that was\r\nyet more terrible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\n_The Conflagration.--A dread Alternative.--Forward or backward.--A bold\r\nDecision.--The Hood.--A terrible Venture.--The red Place of Flame.--The\r\nPlace of the fiery Glow.--The toppling Tree.--A Struggle for Life.--The\r\nfiery Atmosphere.--The last supreme Moment._\r\n\r\n\r\nAS this sight thus came upon his view, Phil drove his float towards the\r\nshore on the left, until his feet touched bottom; and standing here he\r\nlooked down the river upon the conflagration. Away before him stretched\r\nthat vista of fire, the pathway before him led through an avenue of\r\nflame, the burning forest glowed on either side, while overhead the vast\r\nvolumes of smoke rolled along, and around him fell showers of ashes.\r\nThere before him through that scene of terror lay his pathway; the way\r\nwhich lie thought was leading him to safety had brought him here; the\r\nriver, to which he had intrusted himself, had borne him along to this;\r\nand at the very moment when his hopes had been most excited, they were\r\ndashed at once to the ground.\r\n\r\nAnd what now?\r\n\r\nWhat should he do?\r\n\r\nCould he go back?\r\n\r\nGo back? No; that was a simple impossibility. How should he go back? Not\r\nthrough the woods, for he could make but small advance through the dense\r\nforest that now surrounded him; not up the stream, for how could his\r\nstrength bear him on against this current? He would have to wander for\r\ndays before he could reach the place which he had left that morning; and\r\nof what avail would it be if he did reach it? What would he do? Where\r\ncould he go? No; to go back was not to be thought of.\r\n\r\nHe saw plainly that he had now to make choice from, one of two\r\nalternatives.\r\n\r\nOne was to remain here and wait for the fires to subside.\r\n\r\nThe other was to go forward.\r\n\r\nNow, the idea of waiting here was intolerable. To wait here idle, or,\r\nperhaps, slowly retreating before the advancing fires, enduring day\r\nafter day the hunger, the fatigue, and the misery of such a situation,\r\nseemed the worst fate conceivable. Where could he sleep at night?\r\nHow could he endure living in the water by day? Besides, the fire was\r\nevidently advancing in a direction which led it up stream; so that he\r\nwould merely be driven before it back to his old quarters, to perish\r\nmiserably. To be driven back before the fires would be a lingering\r\ndeath. It was not to be thought of, so long as any other course was\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the other course?\r\n\r\nThe other course was--to go forward.\r\n\r\nTo go forward!\r\n\r\nThis was what Phil longed to do, with longing unspeakable. To go forward\r\nwould lead him farther down the river. To go forward would carry him\r\nbeyond the fires. Once let him pass the place where the fire raged, and\r\nthen he would be on the other side of it; out of its hot breath; away\r\nfrom its stifling smoke. Could he but once make that passage, all would\r\nbe well. To him it seemed as though on the other side of those fires\r\nthere lay the abodes of men, and open lands, and pure air, and help, and\r\nliberty, and life. It was there that he longed to go.\r\n\r\nBut between him and what he fancied to lie beyond, there lay a barrier,\r\nterrific, tremendous, whose fullest horrors were unknown; a barrier that\r\nseemed impassable--irremovable. How could he hope to overcome it?\r\n\r\nUnder any other circumstances, the idea of passing that barrier could\r\nnot, of course, be entertained. But there was one thing in Phil’s\r\nsituation which made him think that the deed might be done; that it was\r\nnot impossible, or even difficult. This one thing that gave hope was the\r\nriver. Its stream might still bear him on its bosom, amidst those fires;\r\nhe might find protection in its running waters. He could keep cool amid\r\nthat fervent heat; and as the stream would itself bear him on, he would\r\nnot need to make any efforts except those which served to guide him in a\r\nright course.\r\n\r\nAs he thought of this, and of the possibility of making his passage, he\r\nfelt eager to go, but was restrained by other thoughts.\r\n\r\nHow far might those fires extend? How long could he endure the presence\r\nof those flaming woods, even in the waters of the river? Could he\r\nbreathe? Would not the intense heat make breathing impossible? That\r\nburning district might extend for many and many a mile; and if he once\r\nventured there, how would he ever get out of it? Or again, might not\r\nthat possible obstacle in the river waters, which he had dreaded, be\r\nfound down there amid the burning forests? And if so, what a\r\nterrible fate would be his!--to be arrested amid raging fires by a\r\ncataract--unable to advance, unable to retreat, unable to go ashore! If\r\nhe could only form some idea as to the possible extent of the fire,--if\r\nhe could only see beyond that next turn in the river, and find out how\r\nfar those fiery shores ran on,--then he might know whether there was any\r\nhope. But this was impossible. The land before his eyes was a land of\r\nfire; its trees blackened by the fire, or still glowing red as they\r\nquivered under its attack; and there was no way by which he might know\r\nanything more than this.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a thought which gave him great encouragement. He\r\nthought that the fire in its march must exhaust itself after a certain\r\ntime, and that after the trees were actually consumed there must be a\r\ndeparture of the heat. It was in the advanced part of its march that it\r\nmaintained this furnace glow; at a certain distance behind, the heat\r\nmight not be intolerable. If, therefore, he could traverse the flames\r\nand the fire that he saw before him, he might find the country beyond\r\nnot much worse than it was here.\r\n\r\nThis thought, this hope, decided him. He determined to stake everything\r\nupon this, and venture upon that fiery path.\r\n\r\nBut before he attempted it he made the only preparation possible. What\r\nhe dreaded most was the scorching glow of those flames; and as he did\r\nnot know to what extent they might affect him, he wished above all\r\nthings to guard his head against that danger.\r\n\r\nHe therefore unbound his clothes from the log, and took his coat out,\r\nafter which he again bound the remainder of the clothes to the place\r\nwhere they had been. His coat he dipped in the river until it was\r\nsaturated with the water, and then carefully adjusted it over his head,\r\ntying the sleeves under his chin so that it served the purpose of a\r\nhood. In this way he hoped to have a protection from the heat of the\r\nburning forest, while his eyes would be shaded from the dazzling and\r\nblinding glare, and would be able to watch without interruption or\r\nimpediment the course of the river.\r\n\r\nWith these simple preparations Phil breathed a short prayer, committing\r\nhimself to the care of God, and then summoning up all his courage, he\r\ndirected his float down the stream once more, and then boldly launching\r\nforth, he dared the terrible journey. Once more the waters received him\r\nto their embrace; once more the river enfolded him, and bore him gently\r\nonward; once more he swept past the shores, and saw them recede on\r\neither side. The current bore him on. The fire drew near.\r\n\r\nThe fire drew near--and nearer. He felt its hot breath, growing hotter\r\nupon his brow--nearer yet--and then, at length, the flames dashed\r\nforward, the green trees passed from his line of vision, and his eyes\r\nsaw nothing but one vast and far-reaching glare.\r\n\r\nHe plunged his head beneath the water, and held it under as long as he\r\ncould. When he raised it again he found himself farther on in the midst\r\nof the flaming trees. The heat of the air was intense, yet not so much\r\nso as he had feared. His dripping coat hung round his head, protecting\r\nhim. His course was true, for looking forward he saw that he was still\r\nin the very middle of the stream.\r\n\r\nOne look was sufficient, and then, desiring to prepare himself as much\r\nas possible for the worst that the fire might bring against him, he once\r\nmore plunged his head under.\r\n\r\nWhen he next raised his head, he found the scene somewhat changed. The\r\ndazzling flash of leaping, up-springing flames had passed away. He had\r\nmoved past the advanced line of the fire where the flames were assailing\r\nthe light twigs and foliage of the trees, and had come to that inner\r\nportion where the trees were standing bare of everything that the flame\r\ncould destroy; skeletons--glowing red in the embrace of consuming fire.\r\nThe glow was all around--on the ground, on the trees--and the emanation\r\nof heat was far more intense. The air was now like that of a room heated\r\nto an intense degree; yet, to his immense relief, it was not worse than\r\nhe had known air to be before; and to him it seemed like the atmosphere\r\nof a room overheated on some winter day. He could breathe without\r\ndifficulty, and thanks to his extemporized hood, and his plunges under\r\nwater, he did not feel that scorching glow of the hot fires that he\r\nmight otherwise have felt. Well was it for him that he was spared\r\nthe necessity of exertion. In that atmosphere any exertion would have\r\novercome him in a very short time. As it was he had only to cling to his\r\nfloat, steer it straight, and from time to time plunge his head under\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn this way he was borne steadily on, and succeeded in preserving\r\nhimself from destruction during that first entrance into the avenue of\r\nflame. He was now in the avenue of fire, and over this the flood bore\r\nhim, until at length he reached that bend on the river which he had seen\r\nbefore starting upon this last journey.\r\n\r\nThe river turned to the right, and swept away for about as great a\r\ndistance as lay between this bend and the last one. As Phil looked at it\r\nin eager and anxious scrutiny, he saw to his dismay that the fire glow\r\ncovered all the land before him, and on either side. He had been too\r\nsanguine, and had not made sufficient allowance for the tenacity of\r\nthe fire where it once has fixed its grasp. There rose the trees--the\r\nskeletons--red--glowing in a fervid glow; and the air was hotter\r\nhere--more torrid--more stagnant.\r\n\r\nHere, then, Phil found a severer trial than any which he had yet\r\nexperienced; and the sight of these new regions, all glowing in the\r\nwide-spread conflagration, showing far and wide the withering signs\r\nof fiery devastation, filled him with awe and apprehension. There was\r\nnothing, however, which he could do. He could only do as he had been\r\ndoing, and draw his hood over his face as far as he could without\r\nobstructing the view, and guide himself in the right course, and\r\noccasionally plunge beneath the waters so as to maintain the protection\r\nthat was afforded by the moisture and the sheltering hood.\r\n\r\nThe time seemed long as he thus drifted on; but at length, to his great\r\njoy, he reached the next bend in the river, and began slowly to pass\r\naround it.\r\n\r\nBut the joy which he had felt at reaching this place soon passed away,\r\nwhen, on turning the point and entering upon the new course of the\r\nriver, he beheld before him an unchanged scene of devastation. There, as\r\nbefore, the glowing fire appeared on the ground below and in the trees\r\nabove; the latter rising all red in the fire, and crumbling slowly\r\nbeneath its touch. One difference there was; and that was, that in\r\nthis new scene the conflagration seemed to be farther advanced; giant\r\nbranches fell to the ground; tall trees toppled over, and the silence\r\nthat had reigned was now broken by the thunder of those falling masses.\r\n\r\nThe air here was also hotter; for as the fire had been burning longer,\r\nso everything was affected by its long intensity. Now it was that Phil\r\nfirst began to find something approximating to what he had dreaded--a\r\nheat which made breathing difficult, and made the air like that at the\r\nmouth of a furnace.\r\n\r\nThrough this he drifted on as before. His soul already began to yield to\r\ndespondency; while hope grew fainter, and a dark dismay gradually took\r\npossession of his heart. How could it end? Would it ever end? Were there\r\nany limits to the burning woods? Must he thus go drifting on, and find\r\nthat every new scene, as it opened up, was worse than its predecessor?\r\n\r\nSo he drifted on.\r\n\r\nAs he thus went on, he suddenly saw immediately before him, on the edge\r\nof the bank, a tree which was slanting over the river, and seemed to\r\nhim to be swaying, or toppling slowly over. It had been assailed most\r\nfiercely by the flames. Its trunk and branches were all glowing red,\r\nwhile the fire seemed to have burned into the ground, and consumed those\r\nroots which had thus far held it in its place. The slight movement\r\nhad arrested Phil, and instinctively he turned his course towards the\r\nopposite shore. The tree was tall, but whether it could reach across\r\nthe river, he could not tell. It seemed to be falling, and if it did,\r\nit would fall across the stream. Thus Phil, by a blind instinct, shifted\r\nhis course slightly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0261]\r\n\r\nThe tree slowly tilted over. It descended farther and farther. Phil\r\nat that same moment was being borne on by the current. The danger was\r\nimminent. The tree would fall upon him. With a frantic effort he threw\r\nhimself nearer to the shore, and as he did so, the tree descended. Phil\r\nlet go the log, and swam towards the shore. There was a rush, and a\r\nsweep through the air; a rattling, crashing sound, followed by a hiss,\r\nas the red-hot mass touched the water; there was the shower of a million\r\nsparks, and then all was still.\r\n\r\nPhil felt every fibre of his frame tingle with horror, and thrill with\r\na sense of descending ruin. But the moment passed. His feet touched\r\nbottom. He turned and looked around. There, about three yards from him,\r\nlay the tree, its roots still on the other bank, and its top buried\r\nbeneath the water. With a wild, despairing glance Phil looked for\r\nhis float. Even as he looked, he saw it slowly emerge from the water,\r\nseveral yards below where the tree lay. For the tree in its descent had\r\nstruck it, and dashed it to the bottom of the river; but fortunately it\r\nhad become disentangled, and the current had freed it from the tree, and\r\nthere it floated, ready once more to assist him.\r\n\r\nPhil swam down the stream towards it, and almost fainting with the\r\nfatigue of this exertion, he clung to it motionless, panting heavily,\r\nand now scarcely able even to guide himself aright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\n_The black Place of Desolation.--Blue Sky.--Open Heavens.--The Glory of\r\nthe Sunshine.--Green Hills.--The open Sea once more.--Along the Road.--A\r\nstrange, a very strange Encounter.--The Wandering Leper.--Naaman the\r\nSyrian._\r\n\r\n\r\nPANTING heavily, and almost fainting with exhaustion, Phil drifted on,\r\nclinging with a convulsive grasp to his log, and scarce conscious of his\r\nsurroundings. It was the current that now guided him, for he for some\r\ntime was incapable of making any effort to guide himself. Several times\r\nhe instinctively thrust his head under the water; and each time, though\r\nthis did not ease his breathing, it at least caused relief by the\r\ngrateful coolness and the drip of the water over his face. Drifting on\r\nin this way, he remained for some time without noticing the shores on\r\neither side, too much taken up with his own sensations to regard any\r\nexternal things. He had a general idea that the fires were all around\r\nhim still; but he no longer sought with his former eager scrutiny to\r\nfind some signs favorable to his own hopes.\r\n\r\nBut at length he regained his breath, and began once more to look\r\naround. The first thing that he noticed was, that the heat had very\r\nmaterially lessened. The next thing was, that the land of the fiery glow\r\nhad passed away. Around him there was now, not a fiery country, but a\r\nblack and devastated country, out of which smoke was still arising in\r\nplaces, but from which the fire had departed, having done its work. He\r\nnow saw that while he had been in a half senseless state he had been\r\ncarried along; that the current had drifted him away from the place\r\nwhere the fire was now raging, to a place where it raged no longer--to a\r\nplace where the air was cooler--where it was purer--where the smoke was\r\nmuch diminished. All around, and all before, the country was black, and\r\nthere arose a forest of charred and blackened trees; but this sight,\r\nhideous though it might be in itself, was inexpressibly delightful to\r\neyes that had just gazed upon the fire in its wrath.\r\n\r\nHe began to understand his position now. This was the very thing that he\r\nhad hoped for when first he ventured to make the passage. His hope had\r\nbeen realized. The fire was advancing up the stream. He had passed\r\nthe front line of flame, the second line of fire, and now reached the\r\nblackened and desolate tract that lay in the rear of the conflagration.\r\nHere the hot breath of the fire existed no longer. Here the air was\r\npurer--it grew cooler at every yard of his progress forward.\r\n\r\nIt was, probably, this cooler air that had revived him, and given him\r\nback the breath that he had nearly lost forever at that time of his\r\nstruggle near the falling tree.\r\n\r\nHe looked up. The smoke was thinner overhead. Before him the skies were\r\nbrighter, and in one place the glorious blue of heaven was discernible.\r\nIt was the first bit of blue sky that he had seen since first he entered\r\nthese ill-omened woods; and it seemed to him to be the harbinger of\r\nsafety, and liberty, and life. His whole soul roused itself in joyous\r\nhope; the last vestige of his dismay and despondency departed, and\r\neven his weakness and bodily languor left him. He gave a cry of joy; he\r\nbreathed a prayer of thankfulness to the merciful One who had preserved\r\nhim from a terrible fate; and then, grasping his float with a strong\r\nand nervous clutch, he once more put forth his efforts to quicken his\r\nprogress, and struck out with strong and rapid strokes.\r\n\r\nEvery moment his prospects increased. The smoke faded away more and\r\nmore, and the blue sky unfolded itself, until at last the glorious sun\r\nburst forth to view, and threw upon him those bright and gladdening rays\r\nto which he had been a stranger for so many days. There came up also a\r\nbreeze, and it fanned his flushed face, bringing healing on its wings;\r\nand as he inhaled it there seemed in it something which was like a new\r\nlife, something which gave new strength and energy to the body, and new\r\njoy and hope to the soul. At last he could breathe freely. The air had\r\nlost all that oppressiveness which it had so long had. No longer was\r\nthere perceptible the abhorrent smell of smoke. He had emerged from\r\nthe fire and the smoke, and wherever he was, he had at least left these\r\nthings behind. He had no idea where he was, or whither he was going;\r\nit was enough for him to know that he had escaped from the fire and the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nHe had been long in the water, but he had no desire to leave it. The\r\nland was not inviting, while his present mode of progress was easy and\r\nagreeable. He chose, therefore, to drift on until he should reach some\r\nplace where he might rest.\r\n\r\nAt length there appeared before him something green. It looked like the\r\nfoliage of trees. It rose above the black land and the charred stumps of\r\nthe burnt district, and seemed to be some place which the fire had not\r\nreached. Was it some green oasis in this desert of devastation, or was\r\nit some new forest as boundless, as uninhabited, and as desolate as the\r\none in which he had been lost? At that moment it mattered not to him\r\nwhat it was, so long as it was some place that was free from the touch\r\nof fire.\r\n\r\nOnward he drifted, and the stream took a turn, and swept forward. Here\r\nthe green foliage appeared full before him. It was of no great extent.\r\nBeyond it there was no vast forest, but only the sky. It seemed as\r\nthough in one place there might be a broad plain, so low did it lie, and\r\nso open was it, and bare of trees. This place he watched with the most\r\neager scrutiny. To this he came nearer and nearer. The space broadened\r\nevery moment, until at last he thought that it must indeed be a wide\r\nplain--if plain it was.\r\n\r\nNearer he drew and nearer. Then, at length, a suspicion came to his mind\r\nthat startled him greatly. Nearer he came, and nearer, and the suspicion\r\nchanged to reality, for there, full before him, lay nothing less than\r\nthe sea!\r\n\r\nThe sea!\r\n\r\nYes, the sea! The river ran into a harbor. The harbor opened out into\r\nthe sea. It was not a bay. It was the sea, with the distant horizon\r\ntouching the sky. Before he had reached the green spot, he came to a\r\nplace where a bridge had been, and of which nothing now remained but\r\nsome charred timbers. This showed him that he could not be very far from\r\nhuman habitations. A little below this he reached the green spot, and,\r\nlanding here, he loosened his clothes from the log, and dressed himself.\r\nThey were wet; but his watch was still ticking bravely, and marked three\r\no’clock. His matches were also dry, and a piece of trout left from his\r\nmorning’s repast was still there unharmed. This he ate with an eager\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nHe spread out his wet coat upon the grass, and lay down by it, and,\r\nwhile resting, deliberated about what he ought next to do. Where he was\r\nhe had not the faintest idea. He could not be on the Bay de Chaleur, for\r\nthen the opposite shore would be visible; but here there was no shore\r\nopposite. He thought that it must be the Gulf of St. Lawrence. If so,\r\nthen that bridge must belong to the road that ran along the shore, and\r\nsettlements could not be very far away.\r\n\r\nHe was now too impatient to rest any longer, and was so eager to find\r\nout where the road led to, that he took his half-dried coat over his\r\narm, and started off towards the burnt bridge. The road here seemed to\r\nbe pretty well travelled, and the sight of this stimulated still more\r\nhis desire of reaching some house; so he at once set off.\r\n\r\nHe walked for about a mile, through a district that had been burnt, and\r\nthen came to the seashore again. Here the trees were green, and there\r\nwere no signs of fire. There was a cool and refreshing breeze now from\r\noff the sea, and the hope of finding a house stimulated him to such a\r\ndegree that he maintained a rapid walk for at least another mile.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as he ascended a slight elevation, he saw a figure, on the\r\nroad before him, advancing towards him. It was a boy that he saw. He was\r\nwalking wearily, and seemed both tired and dejected. He was looking at\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nPhil hurried towards him. The boy did not notice him till he had come\r\nquite close. Then he looked up.\r\n\r\nAs Phil saw that face, he stood for a moment speechless with amazement\r\nand delight.\r\n\r\nIt was Pat!\r\n\r\n“Pat!” he cried. “Pat!”\r\n\r\nHe could say no more. Tears of joy started to his eyes. He grasped Pat’s\r\nhand in his, and looked at him, completely overcome. He was too deeply\r\nagitated to notice Pat’s face or manner, but stood overcome by his own\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\n“So you’ve been after me,” said Phil. “Where are the rest of them?\r\nWhere’s Bart? How did you get here? What place is this? Only think of my\r\ngetting out here--and only a few minutes ago--and then meeting with you!\r\nBut where are the others? Come, I’m crazy to see Bart. I declare I never\r\nwas so utterly confounded in my life! But what’s the matter with you?”\r\n\r\nIn the midst of Phil’s eager torrent of exclamations and questions,\r\nhe was struck by something very peculiar in Pat’s face, and in Pat’s\r\nmanner, and ended all with this abrupt question.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Pat’s appearance was very peculiar.\r\n\r\nHis face was pale, and had an anxious expression. His eyes, generally so\r\nmerry, and open, and frank, were now furtive and suspicious; and instead\r\nof showing any pleasure at the sight of Phil, he started back, and\r\nsnatched his hand away.\r\n\r\nAt Phil’s question Pat gave a very heavy sigh, and made no answer.\r\n\r\n“Pat, Pat, what is the matter?” cried Phil again. “Has anything\r\nhappened? Where’s Bart? What is the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Matther,” muttered Pat. “Matther enough, surely, as ye’ll know to yer\r\nsorra.”\r\n\r\nAt this Phil stared at him in amazement. Pat was so totally changed from\r\nhis former self, that he couldn’t comprehend it at all.\r\n\r\n“Come, Pat,” said he, “don’t keep me in suspense. I see by your manner\r\nthat some horrible thing has happened to some of you. Which is it? Is it\r\nBart?”\r\n\r\nPat shook his head.\r\n\r\n“It’s me,” said he, in a dismal voice. “Me. I’m the one.”\r\n\r\n“You! Why, what do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I’m a leper!” wailed Pat.\r\n\r\n“You, what? You’re what? What are you talking about?”\r\n\r\n“You’ll know soon enough. An maybe ye’ll find out from shakin my hand\r\nthe way ye did jist now.”\r\n\r\n“Shaking your hand!”\r\n\r\n“Yis,” said Pat. “Ayven the touch of me’s on-whowlsome, so it is. An\r\nI’ve got that on me that’s goin to be the death of me afore long, so it\r\nis.”\r\n\r\n“See here, Pat,” cried Phil, anxiously. “Tell me what’s the matter, like\r\na good fellow. You make me horribly anxious. What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Och, sure, an what’s the use? Didn’t I say it? What are ye tormentin me\r\nfor to say it again? Haven’t I just run away whin it’s too late\r\nintirely? An the leprosy’s tuk, so it has!”\r\n\r\n“The--the what? What’s that?” asked Phil. “Sure an haven’t I been sayin\r\nthat it’s a leper I am,” cried Pat, despairingly.\r\n\r\n“A leper!” repeated Phil, who began to think that poor Pat was\r\nquite insane, and wondered what he ought to do with him under the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n“I’ve happened among lepers,” said Pat. “I’ve bathed in the leper\r\nwather--an that’s the way I tuk it. I’ve ate wid the leper praste; an\r\nBart’s wid him now--in the wuds--they’re huntin afther you; but I ran\r\nfor it--for I was hopin to get away before the leprosy tuk--but tuk it\r\ndid--in spite of me; and that’s all about it.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand you,” said Phil, in bewilderment, for Pat’s remarks\r\nhad some degree of connectedness, and did not sound quite like insanity\r\nexcept his allusions to leprosy. “I don’t understand,” said he, “what\r\nyou mean about leprosy.”\r\n\r\n“Sure it’s the Lazaretto, at Tracadie, I mean. I got the leprosy by\r\nbathin, so I did--an aitin wid the leper praste.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to explain. This is all nonsense. Come, Pat, don’t make a\r\nfool of yourself. You’ve got some absurd idea in your head, Come, tell\r\nme all about it, for I can’t make it out at all, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s this way,” said Pat, with undiminished dolefulness; “ony\r\ndon’t be kapin too nair me if ye vally yer life--this was the way of it.\r\nYe see we wandhered about the wuds afther ye, an sure enough before we\r\nknowed it we got lost ourselves. Well, we wandhered about, and at last\r\nwe come out in a place they call Tracadie, an bad luck to it. So we mit\r\na praste that was all smiles and blarney, an he tuk us to his house\r\nan gave us fud. Well, thin, I wint out for a walk, an I see a bit\r\nof wather, an wint to it to have a bit of a swim. Well, I come to a\r\nonwhowlsome lookin place, wid ghosts of people in it, that wud fairly\r\nmake yer blood run cowld to look at, an I stared at thim, an walked\r\nright close to thim, an brathed their brith, an walked over their\r\nground, an wint on to the wather, an ondrissed, an wint in. An I shwam\r\nthere nearly an hour, an thin I wint back, an what do ye think the\r\npraste towld me.”\r\n\r\n“What?” asked Phil.\r\n\r\n“Sure, he up an he towld us that the onwhowlsome lookin house wor a\r\nlazaretto, an the ghosts of people there wor lepers--nothin else--an\r\nhe said he wor the leper praste, an spint the most of his time wid thim\r\nsame--sittin wid thim--talkin wid thim--feelin thim--handlin thim--an\r\nbrathin the poison leper air. An he towld us that the wather was the\r\nleper wather, where the lepers bathed. An I had bathed there,” cried\r\nPat, with a burst of despair. “An I’d tuk a shwirn there,” he cried,\r\nwith another burst. “An I’d been in the house of the leper praste,”--a\r\ngroan--“an I’d sat on his chairs,”--another groan--“an I’d ate at his\r\ntable,”--a howl--“an I’d swallowed his fud,”--another howl--“an I’d been\r\ngettin the leprosy meself all the time,” and a cry that was something\r\nlike a yell of despair terminated Pat’s story.\r\n\r\nPhil listened to all this, and felt puzzled.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you mean by lazarettos,” said he, “and lepers. I\r\ndid’nt know the disease was in this country.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it is, thin,” moaned Pat. “An I’ll soon be there too, so I will.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense,” said Phil, impatiently. “Did you ask the priest if there was\r\nany danger?”\r\n\r\n“Och, sure he wouldn’t be afther committin himsilf.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t he say anything about it?”\r\n\r\n“He did, thin.”\r\n\r\n“What did he say?”\r\n\r\n“Why, he said he had lived among the lepers all his life, an visited\r\nthim almost every day; but wor as well a man as anybody. An he said the\r\ndisease couldn’t be caught.”\r\n\r\n“Did he say that?” cried Phil. “Why, of course. I knew that. You are\r\nmistaken altogether.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, an how does the praste know? His time’ll come yit, so it will.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! This isn’t the real leprosy, at all. It’s some disease that’s\r\nhereditary, I dare say; but it isn’t contagious. Pooh! how absurd! Why,\r\nPat, what could have put such a notion into your head. The leper water\r\nis all nonsense. What harm could it do you to bathe in the sea? If all\r\nthe lepers in the world were bathing at the same time, they couldn’t\r\naffect the sea water.”\r\n\r\nPhil now began to reason with Pat, and he spoke so earnestly and so\r\nconfidently, that at last Pat’s fears began to yield. Phil showed him\r\nthat he couldn’t possibly have the leprosy yet, and assured him that\r\nhe wasn’t going to have it. Finally, he told him the story of the most\r\nfamous of all lepers--Naaman the Syrian. From this story he proved\r\nso conclusively that there were some kinds of leprosy that were not\r\ncontagious, that Pat hadn’t a word to say. The story produced a profound\r\nand most beneficial effect upon Pat’s mind.\r\n\r\n“Sure an I niver thought of him before. Why didn’t I think of ould\r\nNaymin? An him the chafe gineral of the Misaypytamyins, so he was. Sure\r\nan there wer nothin contagious in that leprosy. The leper Naymin! Sure\r\nan what a fool I wor niver to think of the leper Naymin!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\n_Fish for Breakfast.--The Cottage and the Schooner.--A familiar\r\nSight.--The old Boat.--Sinking in deep Waters.--An exciting and amazing\r\nMeeting.--The Flag.--Bart on the Road.--A strange Discovery.--A fresh\r\nSurprise._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE happy suggestion of Phil brought infinite relief to Pat; and the\r\nstory of Naaman the Syrian had sufficient power over him to dispel his\r\nfears, and restore his olden peace of mind. So great was the reaction\r\nnow, that he went to the other extreme; and being of a very excitable\r\nand volatile temperament, he exhibited a joy as immoderate as his grief\r\nhad been but a short time before. He made Phil tell him all about his\r\nadventures; and as he listened to all the dangers through which his\r\nfriend had gone, his warm Irish heart overflowed with the truest\r\nsympathy, and he followed the story with a running accompaniment of\r\nejaculations of the most animated character. As for his own story, he\r\nhad already told it; but there yet remained the tale of his flight in\r\nthe woods. This he confessed without reservation, and informed Phil that\r\nhe had been wandering in the woods all day, and had stumbled out upon\r\nthe road only about an hour ago. He had seen no houses, and had met no\r\npeople. This information at once changed Phil’s plans. If Pat had seen\r\nno inhabitants after an hour’s walk, it was clearly useless for him to\r\ngo any farther that day. He was worn out with the exertions that he had\r\nmade, and longed for rest. Pat also confessed that he was on the borders\r\nof starvation, and was too tired to go any farther. Upon this, they both\r\nresolved to remain here for the night.\r\n\r\nIt was now somewhat late in the day, but not too late to preclude the\r\npossibility of catching some fish for supper. On Phil’s suggesting this,\r\nPat received it with an enthusiasm that was altogether like his old\r\nself; and as there was no time to lose, they at once set out in search\r\nof a brook. Pat remembered passing one not more than half a mile from\r\nthis place; so they proceeded in this direction, which was the same\r\nin which Phil had been going. Pat’s story had served to give him some\r\ngeneral idea of his whereabouts. Pat had been at Tracadie; and though he\r\nhad lost his way, yet there was every reason to believe that they were\r\nnow not very far away from that place, on the shore of the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence, and most probably to the northward; for though Pat did not\r\nknow exactly his position, yet he was sure that he must have come out of\r\nthe woods farther north than Tracadie.\r\n\r\nAfter about a half mile’s walk they reached a brook and began to fish.\r\nTheir success was not brilliant, but any fish at all were very welcome\r\nat such a time; and the half dozen or so which they succeeded in hooking\r\nwere regarded by them as capable of affording a repast which a king\r\nmight envy. They soon had a fire burning, and broiled the fish on the\r\ncoals, and thus made their dinner. Among the woods here they found a\r\ndistrict which had escaped the ravages of the fire, and here they passed\r\nthe night. They went to rest a little after sundown, and awoke the next\r\nmorning before day. They then made a breakfast off the remains of their\r\nevening’s repast, and were ready for a start.\r\n\r\nThere was no question now as to the route which they should take. Pat\r\nhad been walking in a direction the very opposite of that in which Phil\r\nhad been going, but he had no desire now to persist in it. Then he felt\r\nhimself to be a victim of one of the most cruel fates that can befall\r\nmankind, and was seeking to fly from it, anywhere, no matter where. Now,\r\nhowever, thanks to Phil, and to Naaman, he felt himself to be a victim\r\nno longer, and was anxious to get back to the place where Bart was or\r\nmight be. He felt also a kind of pride arising from the fact that he had\r\nbeen the first one to find Phil; and the pride was quite as strong as\r\nit would have been if he had found Phil by his own actual efforts. The\r\ncircumstances under which their meeting had taken place he dismissed\r\nfrom his mind, and chose rather to dwell upon the fact that his\r\nconfidence in Phil’s ability to take care of himself had been completely\r\nvindicated. So now, on that morning, as they renewed their walk, there\r\nremained in Pat’s mind not a vestige of his foolish fears; but instead\r\nof them there was a sense of triumph, a consciousness of superior merit,\r\nand a sweet anticipation of the glory that would now be his, as he\r\nbrought back Phil in safety.\r\n\r\nTheir frugal repast did not occupy many minutes, and the sun had not yet\r\nrisen when they started. They were eager to go on, and so they walked at\r\na rapid pace. The road was a very primitive one, and had they been in\r\na carriage, their progress would have been rough and slow; but on foot\r\nthey were able to avoid the deep ruts and numerous irregularities, and\r\nmake a very good progress indeed. After about an hour, they came within\r\nsight of a harbor. They had been for some time out of sight of the sea,\r\nand this prospect filled them with the hope that they were not very\r\nfar from Tracadie. To Pat, the sight of the harbor gave very strong\r\nrecollections of that place. The water was very smooth, and seemed like\r\na lake. A long, narrow strip of land separated the harbor from the outer\r\nsea, and the general appearance of the place was very much like that of\r\nthe “leper wather” in which Pat had bathed. As they advanced towards\r\nit, the sun rose; and as the glorious orb ascended from the ocean, their\r\nwhole sight was filled with the splendor of his appearance.\r\n\r\nLooking now upon the scene before them, they saw at last the signs\r\nof man. On the shore was a small cottage, and near the shore, in the\r\nharbor, was a small schooner. These were both only a short distance\r\naway, and to these they hastened. On reaching the cottage they went up\r\nto it, but to their great disappointment found that it was deserted and\r\nin ruins. The door was gone, and it seemed as though it had not been\r\ninhabited for some time.\r\n\r\n“We’ve got to go on further,” said Pat. “There must be more houses\r\nfurther on.”\r\n\r\n“I wish we could find out where we are,” said Phil. “I wonder if any one\r\nis on board of that schooner.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he cast longing eyes upon the schooner before mentioned.\r\nIt was anchored in front of the cottage, not far away from the shore. It\r\nwas a small vessel, and somewhat shabby, and behind it there was a boat\r\nfloating in the water.\r\n\r\n“It looks as if there was some one on board,” said Pat. “They’ve got the\r\nboat there!”\r\n\r\n“I wish I could go and ask them where we are,” said Phil; and saying\r\nthis, he walked towards the beach.\r\n\r\nAs he did so he saw a boat upon the beach. It was old and dilapidated,\r\nlike the house to which it seemed to belong. No sooner had he seen it,\r\nthan he was struck by the thought that he might manage to get to the\r\nschooner by means of this; so he began to examine it very narrowly. It\r\nwas very clumsily constructed, and looked more like a box than a boat;\r\nbut it was strong, and though dilapidated, it still looked as though it\r\nmight float for the short distance that separated the schooner from the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n“I’ll try it,” said Phil.\r\n\r\n“Thry what?” asked Pat.\r\n\r\n“Why, I’ll go out to the schooner in this boat.”\r\n\r\n“How’ll we row her?” said Pat. “We haven’t any oars.”\r\n\r\n“Well, in the first place, it can’t hold more than one; so you’ll have\r\nto stay, unless you want to go very particularly.”\r\n\r\n“Niver a bit do I,” said Pat. “I’m not brakin my heart about it, so I\r\nain’t. I’ll stay an welcome.”\r\n\r\n“Then I’ll go,” said Phil, “and you wait. I’ll have to get something\r\nthough, that’ll do for an oar.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he went back to the house, and looked about for some time.\r\nAt length he found a pole lying near the well, and taking this, he went\r\nback to the boat. Pat and he then pushed it from the shore into the\r\nwater. It floated.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” said Phil. “It’ll carry me out that far any way.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an don’t ye see the wather, how it’s rowlin an rushin in?” cried\r\nPat.\r\n\r\nPhil looked, and saw that the boat was, indeed, anything but\r\nwater-tight, for the water was oozing in through numerous cracks and\r\ncrevices.\r\n\r\n“It’ll take me out that far,” said he; and with these words he jumped\r\ninto the boat, and thrusting the pole into the ground, he pushed her\r\noff.\r\n\r\nPat stood watching his movements with great interest.\r\n\r\nPhil pushed for some time, thrusting his pole down to the bottom, and\r\nmade excellent progress. In this way he reached a point more than half\r\nway to the schooner. Here, however, it grew too deep, and he had to use\r\nthe pole as a paddle. It was but a clumsy instrument for this purpose,\r\nand his progress was but slow; still he managed to draw nearer to his\r\ndestination, and worked with commendable diligence. But unfortunately\r\nthere was something more to be considered than mere progress forward,\r\nand that was the condition of the boat itself. For while Phil was\r\ngaining on the schooner, the water was gaining on him. By the time that\r\nhe had reached half way, the water was over his ankles. Had his progress\r\ncontinued at the same rate, he might have reached the schooner without\r\nany very great inconvenience; but as it was, the water rushed in faster\r\nand faster, and in spite of his efforts he began to fear that he would\r\nnot reach his destination. Fortunately for him, the schooner happened to\r\nbe lying with her stern towards the shore, and the schooner’s boat was\r\nthus brought nearer to him. This materially lessened the distance to be\r\ntraversed. He now sought to reach the schooner’s boat. He paddled with\r\ndesperate efforts, and as he paddled the water rose higher. At length\r\nhe found himself within reach of the schooner’s boat; he flung out his\r\npole, and sought to pull it nearer. As he did so the boat began to sink\r\nunder him. The water rose to his knees. At that instant the schooner’s\r\nboat was within reach, and flinging himself forward, he half scrambled,\r\nhalf tumbled into it.\r\n\r\nThen quite out of breath, he sat down, and rested for a moment, while\r\nthe boat by which he had come slowly drifted off. At this moment a shout\r\nof joy came from Pat, who had been watching the proceedings with intense\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nBut Phil’s movements had not been unnoticed on board the schooner; and,\r\nindeed, he had made noise enough to rouse any who might be there. He was\r\nnot surprised, therefore, when he heard movements on board, and voices,\r\nand footsteps. So he looked up, without rising, so as to see those on\r\nboard, who might be moving.\r\n\r\nPhil had not been surprised at the sound of movements on board; but he\r\nwas very greatly surprised, indeed, at the sight of the person who met\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\nAs he looked up some one advanced to the stern and looked down upon\r\nhim. It was an aged person, with a mild face, and a gracious eye, and a\r\nbenevolent smile. He wore a pea-jacket, and his head was covered with a\r\nsouwester. It was a face the sight of which almost made Phil bound out\r\nof the boat.\r\n\r\nWhile this person excited such emotions in the breast of Phil, his own\r\nemotions at the sight of Phil were no less strong. There he was, in the\r\nschooner’s boat, with no visible means by which his appearance there\r\ncould be explained. The person in the schooner, therefore, stared at\r\nPhil, and then removing his hat with one hand, with the other hand he\r\nthoughtfully scratched his venerable head, and then slowly ejaculated,--\r\n\r\n“Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-d thunder!”\r\n\r\n“Captain Corbet!” exclaimed Phil, in indescribable amazement.\r\n\r\nAnd then they both stared at each other in silence.\r\n\r\nBut the silence was soon broken. Footsteps were heard, and soon one\r\nafter another heads appeared, and then bodies, and then the new comers\r\nstood by the side of Captain Corbet, staring over the stern at Phil in\r\nmute astonishment.\r\n\r\nAnd Phil stared back at them all in astonishment fully equal to their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nIt was Bruce Bawdon!\r\n\r\nAnd Arthur!\r\n\r\nAnd Tom!\r\n\r\nAs for Phil, he could not utter a word. Nor could the others on board\r\nthe schooner.\r\n\r\nBut Pat, the excited watcher on the shore--Pat had seen it all, and\r\nhe was anything but mute. Mute? He howled. He yelled. He vociferated\r\nunintelligible volleys of frantic exclamations, addressed to each by\r\nturns. Then words failed, and he began to dance.\r\n\r\nAt length Phil pulled the boat up, and scrambled on board the schooner,\r\nand was seized by all the boys in turn, and overwhelmed with questions;\r\nwhile he, on his part, overwhelmed them with questions quite as eager\r\nand quite as numerous.\r\n\r\nTheir story was soon told. They had left at the time mentioned by Bruce\r\nin his letter to Bart, and had been cruising along the coast of the Gulf\r\nof St. Lawrence. They had arrived here the day before, and as they were\r\nin no hurry, they had anchored for the night, with the intention of\r\ndoing a little fishing. Their place of rendezvous was Shippegan, which\r\nwas not far away, and they had a week to spare as yet. They had no idea\r\nthat Bart would leave so much before the time, and could not understand\r\nhow Phil had found them.\r\n\r\nPhil’s story was soon told; for, as he was a modest boy, he did not\r\ndwell upon his own adventures to anything like the extent which I have\r\ndone; and so they learned that their meeting was purely accidental, and\r\nthat Phil had been lost, and had found Pat, who had been lost also,\r\nand that these two lost ones had stumbled upon them here, in Tracadie\r\nlagoon.\r\n\r\nAll of which elicited wonder, and laughter, and shouts, and no end of\r\neager questions, and excited exclamations. In the midst of this Tom\r\nrushed off, and by way of giving proper expression to the feelings which\r\nagitated them all, he brought forth the flag of the B. O. W. C. from the\r\ncabin of the Antelope, where, strangely enough, it had been left since\r\ntheir last voyage; and in a few minutes he had hoisted it aloft, where\r\nit fluttered, and floated, and waved triumphantly in the fresh morning\r\nbreeze.\r\n\r\nAnd now Phil thought of Pat, and mentioned that he was upon the shore;\r\nwhereupon Bruce rushed to the boat to go for him. As he leaped in, Phil\r\nand the others looked towards the place where Pat had been standing, and\r\nsaw a wagon and two persons, a boy and a man, talking with Pat.\r\n\r\nNow, you know, that very morning Bart had left along with the priest,\r\non his way to the north, to carry on his search after Phil. It was\r\nearly when they left, but as the road was rough, their progress was not\r\nparticularly rapid. Still they did make some progress, and in process\r\nof time they reached the place where the schooner lay anchored. This\r\nschooner excited Bart’s attention, for there was something in her\r\ngeneral appearance that was strangely familiar. As they drew nearer they\r\nsaw a number of figures on the deck, running to and fro, and giving all\r\npossible signs of the greatest possible excitement. Suddenly, in the\r\nmidst of this, he saw a flag ascend, and float in the breeze. It\r\nwas dark in color, and of a nondescript character, and at first its\r\nemblazonment was not distinctly visible. Soon, however, he came near\r\nenough to see it. Then the whole thing was disclosed.\r\n\r\nIt was the well-known flag--his flag--the flag that had waved over the\r\nmost memorable events of his life--the flag of the B. O. W. C.!\r\n\r\nThe thing was astonishing, yet not incomprehensible. He saw that the\r\nAntelope had probably been cruising about these waters on her way to\r\nShippegan. He saw that he had come upon her in an amazing manner; but\r\nwhat seemed incomprehensible was the excitement on her deck. What\r\nwas the cause, and what did it mean? It could not be that they had\r\nrecognized him, and had done this in honor of his arrival. No; it must\r\nbe something else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing to the priest, but sat filled with excitement, waiting\r\ntill they should come near. In this way they approached the old\r\nhouse, and beside the shore he saw a figure dancing, jumping, yelling,\r\nshouting, waving his cap, and indulging in a thousand fantastic\r\ngestures.\r\n\r\nThis figure was Pat.\r\n\r\nThe wagon stopped, and Bart jumped out, followed by the priest. In a\r\nfew minutes Bart understood all. First of all, Phil had been found;\r\nsecondly, he was on board the schooner, and the excitement was about\r\nhim; and thirdly, Pat claimed the honor of discovering Phil.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this a boat approached the shore, and soon Bruce Rawdon\r\nstood before them, giving them an uproarious welcome. The arrival of\r\nBart had given a new turn to the excitement of the occasion, and they\r\nall went off to the schooner, accompanied by the priest, who entered\r\nmost heartily into the spirit of the joyous scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\n_Where is Solomon?--The Search.--The aged\r\nWanderer.--Recognition.--Boating.--Fishing.--Cooking.--Swimming.--The\r\nPreparations for the Banquet.--The savory Smell.--Solomon dances a\r\nBreakdown, and makes a Speech._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEIR joy was long and uproarious. Innumerable were the questions which\r\nthey asked each other; but at length they succeeded in gathering from\r\nthe confusion a general idea of the fortunes of each member of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in the midst of their joy, there came a mournful thought. It\r\nwas the thought that one was yet missing out of their number, and that\r\nhis fate was involved in mystery.\r\n\r\nWhere was Solomon?\r\n\r\nPat knew nothing more than any of the rest of them, and his story only\r\nserved to show that after leading Solomon astray, he had left him in the\r\nmidst of the forest. Where he now was, none could tell; but all saw\r\nthe necessity of doing something; and so, when Bart proposed that they\r\nshould go in search of him, they all assented most eagerly. The priest\r\nstill saw that they would require his assistance, and offered to take\r\nthem where they wished to go; while Captain Corbet felt such intense\r\ninterest in the fate of his aged friend, that he insisted on making one\r\nof the party, and bringing Mr. Wade as an additional recruit.\r\n\r\nSome preliminaries had to be attended to before they were able to\r\nstart, among which the first was to get themselves ashore. This was\r\naccomplished in two trips; after which the boat was hauled up on the\r\nbeach, and tied to a tree. Then the priest had to see to the well-being\r\nof his horse, which he did by leaving his wagon behind the house, and\r\nletting the horse go free in the meadow.\r\n\r\nAfter this the priest gave them some general advice as to their\r\nproceedings. He reminded them of their former mishaps, and in order to\r\nguard against their losing the way, he advised them to go on in a line,\r\nkeeping always within sound of one another, if not in sight. This they\r\nall promised to do, and made no objection, for their recent various\r\nadventures in the way of wandering had deeply impressed their minds.\r\n\r\nAt length they all started, as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe Priest,\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet,\r\n\r\nMr. Wade,\r\n\r\nBruce,\r\n\r\nArthur,\r\n\r\nBart,\r\n\r\nTom,\r\n\r\nPhil,\r\n\r\nPat.\r\n\r\nThe priest led the way, and leaving the road close by the old house,\r\nthey went straight into the woods. Soon the forest grew thick, and as\r\nthey went on, they saw that here no signs of the fire were visible,\r\nthough how far the green, unburnt forest might extend, none of them\r\ncould know. This, however, did not trouble them in the slightest, but\r\nobeying the priest’s injunction and keeping well within hearing of one\r\nanother, the whole party went forward after their leader.\r\n\r\nAbout two hours after they had disappeared in the woods, a solitary\r\npedestrian might have been seen slowly wending his way along the road\r\nthat leads to Tracadie. He was rather elderly, and walked slowly. His\r\nhat was sadly battered, his hair was grizzled, and his face was of that\r\ncomplexion which usually denotes the man of African descent.\r\n\r\nAs this wanderer approached the place where the schooner was anchored,\r\nhis pace quickened, and he walked onward quite rapidly until he reached\r\nthe old house. Towards this he walked, but only to discover that it\r\nwas ruined and deserted. Upon this the aged wanderer heaved a sigh, and\r\nseating himself in the doorway, gazed intently at the schooner.\r\n\r\nAs he gazed he suddenly seemed struck by some very exciting thought. He\r\nraised his head, still sitting, and stared for a moment most intently\r\nat the schooner. At that moment, the flag, which had been drooping,\r\nsuddenly shook itself out, and unfolded to his astonished gaze the\r\nescutcheon of the B. O. W. C. .\r\n\r\nAt this the aged wanderer bounded up to his feet, and rushed down to the\r\nshore. There he stood in silence for a time, staring at the schooner,\r\nuntil at length his recognition of her was complete. Whereupon he\r\nslapped both hands on his thighs, jumped up in the air, came down on his\r\nright foot, went up again, came down on his left, wheeled about, turned\r\nabout, and, in fact, indulged in a regular breakdown.\r\n\r\nAfter this he stopped, and burst forth into long, loud, vehement, and\r\nuproarious peals of laughter.\r\n\r\nAfter which he resumed the breakdown.\r\n\r\nAnd then, once more, the laughter.\r\n\r\nFinally, he began to bawl to the schooner.\r\n\r\n“Ship, ahoy! Hi yah! Hollo dar! What you bout? Hi-i-i-i ya-a-a-a-a-ah!\r\nMas’r Bruce! Mas’r Atta! Mas’r Tom! Yep. Ye-e-e-e-e-e-p!”\r\n\r\nBut as he called, no answer came, and no matter how loud his voice was,\r\nor how eager his cry, still no response whatever was elicited.\r\n\r\n“De sakes!” he exclaimed, “ef dis yar casium don’t beat all\r\ncreation! Wonda what dey’ll say to see ole Solomon! Dey’re all off,\r\nsuah--fishin--course. An it ain’t a mite ob good to be standin heah\r\nyellin my ole head off. Wonda if dey had a boat!”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he looked up and down the shore, and saw the boat a little\r\ndistance off on his right, drawn up and tied to a tree. The oar was\r\ninside.\r\n\r\nSo intent had he been on the schooner, that he had not looked about the\r\nhouse, and so had not seen the wagon which was behind it, or the horse\r\nwhich was placidly feeding at no great distance off. But if he had seen\r\nthem, they would have had no interest for him, except so far as they\r\nshowed that people were using the house, and that the owner of the horse\r\nwould be back in the course of the day; and even the interest of this\r\ndiscovery would have been nothing in comparison with the sight of the\r\nAntelope. For this showed him that some of the boys were here, and\r\ncould not be far off, and would probably be back before dark. With\r\nthis conviction, Solomon proceeded to launch the boat--a task which he\r\naccomplished with little difficulty; after which he sculled the boat out\r\nto the schooner, and in a short time stood on board.\r\n\r\nArriving here, he had a full confirmation of his suppositions. It was,\r\nindeed, the Antelope, and there was no one on board. By the signs\r\nall around, he perceived that they could not have been gone long.\r\nBed-clothes lay carelessly tossed about, trunks were open, provisions\r\nwere lying on the boxes that had served for temporary tables.\r\n\r\nIt was with a sentiment of affectionate recognition that Solomon gazed\r\nupon the old cooking-stove, at which he had frequently officiated on\r\nformer occasions, which had been impressed upon his memory by events\r\nof such thrilling character. Over that stove he had been bowed by the\r\nweight of heavy responsibilities, and upon it he had achieved some of\r\nthe brightest triumphs of his life. He gazed upon it long and lovingly.\r\nHe was pained to see the rust that covered it. He touched it, and with\r\nloving hands he tried to rub the rust off one of the griddles. Alas!\r\nhe could not. That rust had fixed itself there too deeply to be easily\r\nerased. So he gave up the attempt, and wandered back to the deck, where\r\nhe stood looking all around for some signs of the ship’s company.\r\n\r\nNo signs, however, appeared, and Solomon now began to consider how he\r\nought to pass the day. First of all, he decided to make things look\r\ncomfortable. To this task he set himself, rolling up the mattresses,\r\nputting the trunks and boxes on one side, cleaning the stove as well as\r\nit could be cleaned, and arranging the confused medley of stores which\r\nthey had brought with them. At length this task was ended, and it was\r\nabout noon.\r\n\r\nAll the rest of the day still remained, and Solomon thought that it\r\nwould be a delicate, a considerate, and a grateful act, if he were to\r\nprepare a dinner for the ship’s company, and have it ready for them on\r\ntheir return. An examination of the stores showed him various things\r\nwhich his skill could combine into palatable dishes; but some thing was\r\nstill wanting; and it seemed to him that nothing could so well supply\r\nthat want as the fragrant and aromatic flavor of broiled trout. In\r\nthe brooks that meandered through the surrounding country, trout were\r\nplentiful; and if he should now go after some, it would not only be in\r\nthe line of his duty, but he would also be able to fill up the time in\r\nthe pleasantest possible way.\r\n\r\nSo Solomon prepared his lines, which he had carried in his pocket ever\r\nsince the day when they had started off after Phil, and rowing back to\r\nthe shore, he walked back over the road till he came to a stream which\r\nhe remembered, for by that very stream he had made his escape from the\r\nwoods. Up this he went, and having cut a rod from the woods suitable for\r\nhis purposes, he proceeded up the stream in search of fish.\r\n\r\nAfter an absence of several hours, he emerged once more from the woods,\r\nat the mouth of the stream. An ecstatic smile illumined his dusky\r\ncountenance, his steps were light and active, and from time to time he\r\ncast proud and happy glances at something which he carried in his hand.\r\nAnd, in truth, that burden which he bore was worthy of exciting pride\r\nand happiness in any bosom, for there, strung on a willow twig, were two\r\nnoble salmon, of fine proportions, sufficient for the dinner of a large\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nWith these Solomon returned to the schooner, and in due time readied it.\r\nHe then prepared the fish, and kindled the fire, and began the important\r\nand exciting business of cooking them. While engaged upon this, however,\r\nan idea seized upon him which sent him off into fits, in the shape of\r\none of those breakdowns, by which he was accustomed to let off steam.\r\n\r\nThis was what he did.\r\n\r\nHe undressed himself.\r\n\r\nHe looked all around very stealthily, and saw no signs of any human\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nThen he jumped into the boat, sculled it ashore to the place where he\r\nhad found it, tied it to the tree, and threw the oar inside.\r\n\r\nThen he jumped into the water, and swam back to the schooner.\r\n\r\nThen he dressed himself.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in the solitude of that lonely hold, he once more let\r\noff steam, and proceeded to indulge in a breakdown, which was more\r\nprolonged, more enthusiastic, more sustained, more vehement, more\r\nemotional, more expressive, more African, more hilarious, and at the\r\nsame time more perfectly outrageous and insane than all the other\r\nbreakdowns put together.\r\n\r\nAfter which he subsided into a comparative calm, and resumed his\r\nprofessional duties.\r\n\r\nThus the hours of the day passed away, and at length evening began to\r\ndraw near.\r\n\r\nIt was near sundown when there emerged from the woods the party that had\r\ngone into them in the morning. They were all there. None were missing.\r\nThere were--\r\n\r\nThe Priest,\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet,\r\n\r\nMr. Wade,\r\n\r\nBruce,\r\n\r\nArthur,\r\n\r\nBart,\r\n\r\nTom,\r\n\r\nPhil,\r\n\r\nPat.\r\n\r\nThey were not talkative; they were not demonstrative; but walked along\r\nin silence. They came out of the woods about a quarter of a mile away\r\nfrom the house, and in this silent and dejected way they walked towards\r\nthe place where the boat was. Whether that silence and dejection arose\r\nfrom their disappointment at not finding Solomon, or simply from the\r\nfatigue of a long tramp, with nothing in particular to eat, need not now\r\nbe considered; suffice it to say, that they were silent, and they\r\nwere dejected; and what is more, they were all in a state of perfect\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\n“The boat can’t take more’n half of us at a time,” said Captain Corbet.\r\n“You, boys, choose among yerselves who’ll go fust.”\r\n\r\n“Won’t you come now?” asked Bart of the priest.\r\n\r\n“O, no,” said he. “I’ll wait. I must see about my horse. You go, and\r\nI’ll be ready the next time.”\r\n\r\n“Sure an I’ll wait too, an help ye wid the horse,” said Pat, who had so\r\nutterly overcome his fears of the “leper praist” that he had struck up\r\na violent friendship with him. And no wonder, for the “praist” was a man\r\nafter Pat’s own heart--warmhearted, cordial, affectionate, brave, and\r\nmodest; a man who loved his fellow-men, and gave himself up to them,\r\neven if they were abhorred lepers; and who now was putting himself to no\r\nend of fatigue and trouble for the sake of the lost companion of a set\r\nof harum-scarum boys. Amid all this, he never ceased to cheer them up,\r\nto stimulate their flagging energies, to inspire them with hope,\r\nto rouse the manliest feelings of their generous young natures. And\r\ntherefore it was that Pat fell in love with him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corbet was not anxious to go, and so it happened that Bruce,\r\nArthur, Tom, Phil, and Bart got into the boat, and made the first trip,\r\nwith the understanding that Bruce was to come back for the others.\r\n\r\nThe boat approached the schooner.\r\n\r\nAs they drew near they became suddenly aware of an odor that was\r\nwafted to their nostrils--an odor penetrating, aromatic, fragrant, and\r\ndelicious beyond all description to their famished senses; an odor\r\nthat was suggestive of some great banquet; an odor so rich that these\r\nstarving boys felt as though they might almost feed upon it.\r\n\r\nThey looked up in astonishment. They saw that smoke was issuing from the\r\npipe that projected above the schooner’s deck.\r\n\r\nSome one was on board, and some one had made a fire. Some one was\r\ncooking. Who was that some one? How did he get on board? What did it all\r\nmean?\r\n\r\nSuch were the questions that each one asked himself; but none of them\r\nspoke, for in fact their amazement was too great to allow them to utter\r\nany audible words. Bruce, who was sculling, worked harder than ever,\r\ntwisting his head around at the same time that he tried to see who the\r\nmysterious being was that had got on board the schooner. The others all\r\nstared in the same direction; but to no purpose, for no one was visible.\r\n\r\nAt last the boat touched the schooner’s side, and they all clambered\r\nupon the deck. Bruce was last, and had to wait a moment to fasten the\r\nboat. When he had done this he sprang down into the hold.\r\n\r\nHe there beheld an astonishing sight. There were Arthur, and Bart, and\r\nTom, and Phil, close beside him, staring in silent wonder at a figure\r\nbeside the cooking-stove; while the figure beside the cooking-stove\r\nstood with a ladle in one hand, and a dish cover in the other, enveloped\r\nin the aromatic vapor of a broiling salmon, staring at them in equal\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\n“Mas’r Bart! Mas’r Phil! De sakes now!”\r\n\r\nThe ladle and the dish cover dropped from his hands. He had expected\r\nto see only the two Rawdons and Tom; but he saw Bart and Phil also.\r\nConsequently he was overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n“Solomon!” cried the boys; and hurrying forward, they grasped one after\r\nanother his trembling, and perhaps slightly greasy hands.\r\n\r\n“B’lubb’d bruddrn ob de Bee-see dubble ’Sociatium,” said Solomon\r\nat last, in a voice that was tremulous with emotion, and with slight\r\nindications of an approach to another breakdown. “Dis yer’s a great an\r\nshinin casium. De sperinces we ben an had beat all creatium. We ben a\r\nracin an a chasin arter one anoder in a way dat makes my ole head ache\r\nto tink ob. An den to tink ob me gettin lost, and de last ob all de\r\nventers to hab youns a marchin an a sarchin arter me! An me a huntin\r\nroun for Mas’r Bart, an a comin dis way on de ole schooner! An den\r\nto fine youns all heah, in good helf an sperits! B’lubb’d bruddrn, de\r\n’motions dat’spire dis yer wenebble ole breast ain’t spressible no\r\nways. Durin de lass few weeks I ben called on to suffer ’flictiums,\r\nbut I nebber knowed anytin like de ’citement dat I now feels a surgin\r\nan cumulatin inside o’ me. O, you get out! Go way, now! Sakes\r\nalive! Ye-e-e-e-p! Hi--ya-a-a-a-h! Hi-i-i-i-i-i--ya-a-a-a-a-a-a-a\r\na-a-a-a-a-a-a-h!”\r\n\r\nAnd Solomon here burst forth in a breakdown so tremendous and so absurd,\r\nthat the boys first started back, and then all burst into roars of\r\nlaughter, and laughed till they cried.\r\n\r\nAfter which Bruce went back for the others, and brought them to the\r\nschooner, and they all ate of Solomon’s banquet and were refreshed; and\r\nthe priest staid all night, and on the following morning bade them an\r\naffectionate adieu; and shortly after the Antelope spread her white\r\nwings to the breeze, and slowly, but gracefully, passed over the waters\r\nof Tracadie lagoon, to the outer seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\n_Away from Tracadie.--The Gulf of St. Lawrence.--The Bay de\r\nChaleur.--The innumerable Fishing Boats.--Along Harbor--Shippegan.--The\r\nAcadians.--The Memories of Grand Pré._\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was a beautiful morning; the wind blew fair, and the blue waters\r\nof the Gulf of St. Lawrence spread far away before them as they left\r\nTracadie. Reunited so strangely after such wonderful adventures, they\r\nhad not yet satisfied their curiosity; but each one had still something\r\nto ask the other. Pat had to tell once more the cause of his desertion;\r\nSolomon had to explain his wanderings; Bart had another account to give;\r\nwhile, above all, Phil had to recount, for the hundredth time, the whole\r\nstory of his adventures in the woods. The venerable Corbet, assisted by\r\nhis mate, Wade, navigated the vessel; Solomon resumed his duties in the\r\nhold over the cooking-stove; while the eager boys gathered in knots to\r\ntalk over the inexhaustible themes above mentioned.\r\n\r\nFar away on the right extended the waters of the gulf, till the view\r\nwas bounded by the horizon. Before and behind was the same illimitable\r\nprospect. But on the left lay the land,--a low, wooded coast,--and their\r\ncourse lay parallel with this. Their destination was the Bay de Chaleur,\r\naround which they proposed to take a cruise; but this proposed cruise\r\nseemed now to promise but little in comparison with the adventures which\r\none half of the party had already met with, and the fortunes of Bart’s\r\nparty, far from creating pity in the minds of the other boys, only\r\nexcited their envy; for there was not one of them who did not wish that\r\nhe had been in the burning forest.\r\n\r\nAbout midday the wind grew lighter, and the schooner’s progress slower.\r\nThey passed two openings that led into the bay which divided two islands\r\nfrom the main land. The first one was Shippegan Island; and the other,\r\nwhich lay beyond this, was called Miscou Island. These two extended\r\nalong at the mouth of the bay in such a way as to form a natural\r\nbreakwater. They sailed past these, and by evening they rounded Point\r\nMiscou, entered the bay, and as the wind was now adverse, they anchored\r\nfor the night.\r\n\r\nThe Bay de Chaleur is about seventy miles long and twenty wide. On\r\naccount of the islands at its mouth it is sheltered from the worst\r\ngales, while on every other side it is land-locked. It thus becomes a\r\nvast harbor, affording throughout its whole extent an excellent shelter\r\nfor vessels.\r\n\r\nAround its shores, particularly on the south, are smaller harbors, upon\r\nwhich little villages are already rising. The bay divides the Province\r\nof New Brunswick from that of Quebec; and on account of its many\r\nadvantages, it will, no doubt, become well known to the world before\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the wind changed, and blew more favorably. It\r\nwas Captain Corbet’s design to go first to the settlement of Shippegan,\r\nand in this direction they now sailed. As they went on their way, they\r\nwere amazed at the vast number of sails that dotted the surface of the\r\nsea. They were all fishing boats, and appeared to be on their way to the\r\ngulf. As they came to Miscou Gully, which separates Miscou and Shippegan\r\nIslands, they saw the fishing boats passing through; and further on, at\r\nShippegan Gully, which lies between the main land and the island of that\r\nname, they found it traversed by a still larger number.\r\n\r\n“I’ve ben in these here waters,” remarked Captain Corbet, in answer to\r\nsome inquiries, “onst or twist, afore, an its allers ben the same. All\r\nthese craft air fishin boats; an I never see the place yet, in all my\r\nborn days that can turn out on a pinch sich a lot of small fishin craft\r\nas this here bay.”\r\n\r\nTwo or three miles of a run down a long, narrow harbor, where the\r\nwaters were deep enough for large ships, brought them at last to their\r\ndestination. A wharf lay there, at which the Antelope drew up, and the\r\nboys all stepped joyfully ashore.\r\n\r\nThe village of Shippegan was a small settlement, with scattered houses\r\nof very simple construction. Close by the wharf stood the most prominent\r\nstructure in the place, being a huge saw-mill, which now, as they\r\nlanded, sent forth that hissing, cutting, slashing, grinding howl and\r\nuproar characteristic of such establishments. Towards this place the\r\nboys first directed their steps; and on reaching it they were greeted\r\nin a very pleasant manner by a gentleman who introduced himself as\r\nMr. Smith. He was the owner of the mills, and though the place was so\r\nremote, he was not at all discontented, but, on the contrary, showed\r\nan enthusiastic attachment to this country, which he affirmed to be the\r\nbest place in the world to live in. No sooner did he learn the object\r\nof the party, than he at once began to give a glowing account of the\r\nbeauties and attractions of the Bay de Chaleur. In particular he urged\r\nthem to visit the Restigouche Valley, at the extremity of the bay, where\r\nhe affirmed they would find some of the most magnificent scenery, and\r\nsome of the finest sport in the world.\r\n\r\nYet it was in this very place that the boys found the greatest\r\nattraction, for Mr. Smith happened to say, in a casual way, that the\r\npeople were Acadian French. No sooner had he mentioned that name than\r\nthe boys asked the meaning of it. They were informed that these people\r\nwere the descendants of the Acadians, and that the ancestors of most of\r\nthem had been expelled from their homes in Nova Scotia, and fled to this\r\nplace. This at once excited the deepest interest in their minds. All\r\nthat had reference to the old Acadians was most attractive to them, and\r\nin the persons of the Shippeganders they hoped to find reproduced the\r\nforms of those gentle, poetic, and simple-minded peasants, with whom\r\nthey had become acquainted in the beautiful verses of Evangeline.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected enthusiasm of the boys delighted Mr. Smith, who at once\r\ndeserted his saw-mill, and proceeded to show them the place. It was of\r\nno very great extent, and contained not more than forty or fifty small\r\ncottages. These were all built of frame, and shingled over. The road was\r\ngrass-grown, and did not appear to have any very intimate acquaintance\r\nwith wheeled vehicles. The people had an unmistakably foreign aspect,\r\nbut were very pleasant in their looks and manners. The women wore\r\nshort homespun frocks, with a jacket, and a head-dress consisting of a\r\nhandkerchief of bright colors. Some of them were spinning at the doors\r\nof their cottages, others were knitting, others attending to the duties\r\nof the dairy. In the fields were the men making hay. Children laughed\r\nand danced, in their play, about the cottage doors. In the middle of the\r\nvillage was a small, simple chapel, with a cross upheld from one point\r\nof its roof, and a small belfry from the other.\r\n\r\nAs the party walked down the road they were greeted with pleasant\r\nsmiles, in which there were both natural curiosity and kindly welcome.\r\nMr. Smith spoke to the people some friendly words in the _patois_ used\r\nby them, which he seemed to understand perfectly; and the answers,\r\nthough unintelligible to the boys, had a pleasant meaning to their\r\nminds, on account of the merry laughter and amiable faces of the\r\nspeakers. The little children stopped in their sport as the strangers\r\ncame along, and stood, with their round, merry faces, staring with\r\nlaughing black eyes.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the boys found in this scene all that they could wish, and\r\nmore than they had anticipated. It realized very closely the ideas which\r\nthey had formed from the description in Evangeline; and Bart, as he\r\nlooked around, could not help repeating the well-known words:\r\n\r\n               “There, in the midst of its farms, reposed the Acadian village;\r\n\r\n               Strongly built were the houses, with frames of oak and of\r\n\r\n                        chestnut,\r\n\r\n               Such as the peasants of Normandy built in the days of the\r\n\r\n                        Henrys.\r\n\r\n               There, in the tranquil evenings of summer, when brightly the\r\n\r\n                        sunset\r\n\r\n               Lighted the village street, and gilded the vanes on the chim\r\n\r\n                        neys,\r\n\r\n               Matrons and maidens sat in snow-white cap, and in kirtles\r\n\r\n               Scarlet, and blue, and green, with distaffs spinning the golden\r\n\r\n               Flax for the gossiping looms, whose noisy shuttles within\r\n\r\n                        doors\r\n\r\n               Mingled their sound with the whir of the wheels and the\r\n\r\n                        songs of the maidens.\r\n\r\n               Solemnly down the street came the parish priest, and the\r\n\r\n                        children\r\n\r\n               Paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless\r\n\r\n                        them.\r\n\r\n               Reverend walked he among them; and up rose matrons and\r\n\r\n                        maidens,\r\n\r\n               Hailing his slow approach with words of affeetionate welcome.\r\n\r\n               Then came the laborers home from the field, and serenely the\r\n\r\n                        sun sank\r\n\r\n               Down to his rest, and twilight prevailed. Anon from the\r\n\r\n                        belfry\r\n\r\n               Softly the Angelus sounded, and over the roofs of the village\r\n\r\n               Columns of pale blue smoke, like clouds of incense ascend\r\n\r\n                        ing,\r\n\r\n               Rose from a hundred hearths, the homes of peace and con\r\n\r\n                        tentment.\r\n\r\n               Thus dwelt together in love these simple Acadian farmers;\r\n\r\n               Dwelt in the love of God and of man. Alike were they free\r\n\r\n                        from\r\n\r\n               Fear that dwells with the tyrant, and envy, the vice of repub\r\n\r\n                        lics.\r\n\r\n               Neither looks had they to their doors, nor bars to their win\r\n\r\n                   dows;\r\n\r\n               But their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of the\r\n\r\n                        owners.\r\n\r\n               There the richest was poor, and the poorest lived in abun\r\n\r\n                        dance.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter traversing the village, they approached a house at the other end,\r\nwhich, though of the same simple construction, was larger and better\r\nthan the others. Two or three of those tall poplar trees, which were\r\nso dear to the Acadians, grew in front. A massive porch was before the\r\ndoor, around which grew a honeysuckle. Two or three barns indicated the\r\ncomfortable circumstances of the owner. As they drew near, they saw an\r\nold man sitting in the porch smoking, who looked at them, and rose with\r\na pleasant smile. His figure was slightly bent, his hair, mustache, and\r\nbeard quite gray, and his whole aspect venerable in the extreme.\r\n\r\n“It’s Benedict Bellefontaine!” exclaimed Bart. “I thought we’d find him,\r\ntoo. Benedict Bellefontaine, the wealthiest farmer of Grand Pre. Here\r\nhe is, in life, dwelling on his goodly acres.”\r\n\r\n“No, it isn’t,” said Mr. Smith, with a laugh. “His name is Grousset,\r\nbut he’ll do very well for Bellefontaine. At any rate, you can judge for\r\nyourselves, for I'm going to introduce you to him.”\r\n\r\nBy this time they had reached the house, and Mr. Smith, after shaking\r\nhands with the old man, introduced the boys. Monsieur Grousset greeted\r\neach one with a paternal smile, and upon learning their errand, at once\r\ninvited them all to stay at his house while they were in the village. At\r\nfirst the boys refused; but the old man was so urgent, and the prospect\r\nof seeing an Acadian home was so attractive, that they at length\r\naccepted the kind invitation.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance which Bart had found between Mr. Grousset and “Benedict\r\nBellefontaine” was, indeed, sufficiently striking to be marked even by\r\none less imaginative. The old man, the house, and the surroundings, all\r\nmight have stood for Longfellow’s description; for though there might be\r\na difference in minor things, the general character was the same:\r\n\r\n               “Firmly builded with rafters of oak, the house of the farmer\r\n\r\n               Stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea, and a shady\r\n\r\n               Sycamore grew by the door, with a woodbine wreathing\r\n\r\n                        around it.\r\n\r\n               Rudely carved was the porch, with seats beneath; and a foot\r\n\r\n                        path\r\n\r\n               Led through an orchard wide, and disappeared in the meadow.\r\n\r\n               Under the sycamore tree were hives overhung by a pent-house\r\n\r\n               Such as the traveller sees in regions remote, by the road-side,\r\n\r\n               Built o’er a box for the poor, or the blessed image of Mary.\r\n\r\n               Farther down on the slope of the hill was the well, with its\r\n\r\n                        moss-grown\r\n\r\n               Bucket, fastened with iron, and near it a trough for the horses.\r\n\r\n               Shielding the house from storms, on the north were the barns\r\n\r\n                        and the farm-yard.\r\n\r\n               There stood the broad-wheeled wains, and the antique ploughs,\r\n\r\n                        and the harrows.\r\n\r\n               There were the folds for the sheep, and there, in his feathered\r\n\r\n                        seraglio,\r\n\r\n               Strutted the lordly turkey, and crowed the cock, with the self\r\n\r\n                        same\r\n\r\n               Voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent Peter.\r\n\r\n               Bursting with hay were the barns, themselves a village. In\r\n\r\n                        each one,\r\n\r\n               Far o’er the gable, projected a roof of thatch; and a staircase\r\n\r\n               Under the sheltering eaves led up to the odorous corn-loft.\r\n\r\n               There, too, the dove-cot stood, with its meek and innocent\r\n\r\n                        inmates,\r\n\r\n               Murmuring ever of love; while above, in the variant breezes,\r\n\r\n               Numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation.\r\n\r\n               Thus, at peace with God and the world, the farmer of\r\n\r\n                        Grand Pré\r\n\r\n               Lived on his sunny farm.”\r\n\r\nFor some time they remained outside, and Mr. Grousset talked with them.\r\nHe spoke English very well, and seemed to be a man of much general\r\ninformation for one of his class, and in so remote a place. He was\r\nthoroughly simple-minded, however, unworldly, and guileless.\r\n\r\nAt length he invited them all to come inside. Mr. Smith excused himself,\r\nas he had to go back to the mill; but the boys entered, and their host\r\nintroduced them to his wife and granddaughter; who were in the house.\r\nThe wife was about the same age as her husband, and the granddaughter\r\nwas about eighteen. Her gentle face and sweet smile at once charmed all\r\nthe boys, who saw in her a very good representative of Evangeline.\r\n\r\nLeaving the boys with his wife and granddaughter, the old man went out\r\nto give some directions about bringing up the luggage from the schooner.\r\nThe boys would have been charmed to engage in conversation with the old\r\nlady and the young “Evangeline,” but unhappily this was not possible.\r\nThe old lady and “Evangeline” could not speak a word of English, and\r\nthe boys could not speak a word of French, and the consequence was, that\r\nthey could only express their mutual good feeling by amiable smiles.\r\n\r\nApart from the regret which this created in their minds, it was very\r\npleasant for them thus to find themselves presented to an Acadian\r\ninterior. It seemed as though they had been carried back into the past,\r\nand suddenly plunged into the midst of that old Acadian life which all\r\nof them loved so much to think about and talk about. Here were the\r\nold scenes of which they had read--the village--the house--the\r\nAcadian farmer--his family--and the crowning grace of all, the gentle\r\nEvangeline.\r\n\r\nThe room into which they had been shown was a large one. At one end was\r\nan enormous fireplace, over which was a marble piece containing a store\r\nof curiosities, such as shells and stones of peculiar shape. There\r\nwas no carpet on the floor, but a number of home-made rugs covered the\r\nmiddle of it. The chairs were old-fashioned, high-backed, rush-seated\r\nconstructions, singularly comfortable, however, and in every way adapted\r\nto carry out the intention of a chair to the utmost perfection. A large\r\nwooden settee stood opposite the fireplace. Overhead the rafters were\r\nbare, and nails were driven in them, from which hung a store of domestic\r\ngoods, such as skeins of yarn and flitches of bacon. The partitions of\r\nthe room were of boards, and upon these were pasted a great variety\r\nof pictures, which Mr. Grousset had probably obtained from some stray\r\nillustrated paper, that had penetrated to this place, and fallen into\r\nhis hands. These pictures had a modern character, which was somewhat\r\nout of keeping with the rest of the interior; but after all, there was\r\na simplicity in such a mode of decoration which took away the sense of\r\ndiscord that might otherwise have been felt.\r\n\r\nAfter a short absence the old man returned, and, seating himself,\r\nbegan to talk with the boys, occasionally translating to his wife and\r\ngranddaughter what they said. He asked them all where they came from,\r\nand Bart narrated their recent adventures, while the old man listened\r\nwith the greatest interest.\r\n\r\n“We all belong to the same school,” said Bart, at length, in answer to\r\nthe old man’s question; for he was puzzled to know how they had come\r\ntogether from such remote places. “We belong to the same school. Our\r\nschool is in a place that you may have heard of. It is Grand Pré.”\r\n\r\nAt this name the old man started and stared at them.\r\n\r\n“What?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Grand Pré,” repeated Bart.\r\n\r\n“Grand Pré!” exclaimed the old man. “Grand Pré? What! On the Basin of\r\nMinas?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Grand Ciel!” exclaimed the other. “And you have been there! And you\r\nhave lived there! How easy it must be to go there! And I was never\r\nthere--never! Alas! why did I not go to see, that place when I was a\r\nyoung man?”\r\n\r\nHis emotion was so strong that his wife asked him the cause.\r\n\r\nHe explained. And Bart noticed that the old lady and the granddaughter\r\nboth looked at them with deeper interest as they repeated the\r\nname--Grand Pré!\r\n\r\n“None of my countrymen live there now, I suppose.” said the old man,\r\nlooking at Bart interrogatively.\r\n\r\nBart shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I thought so,” said the old man. “All gone. They had to go. They\r\nwere banished. They dared not return to that place. They came back, but\r\ncould not get their homes again. Their houses were burnt up, and their\r\nfarms were given away to strangers. Ah, Grand Ciel! what injustice! And\r\nthey so good, so pious, so innocent!”\r\n\r\n“They were shamefully wronged,” exclaimed Bart, in a burst of\r\nindignation,--“most shamefully, most foully wronged!”\r\n\r\n“True,” said the old man. “You are right. They were wronged. They were\r\nrobbed. Ah, how I have heard my grandfather tell about that mournful\r\nday! How he loved that dear home in Grand Pré, which he never dared to\r\nrevisit! He was a young man when he was driven away, and he lived to be\r\nan old man; but he never lost his love for his old home. He was always\r\nhomesick; never content.”\r\n\r\n“Your grandfather!” said Bart, with the deepest interest. “Did he live\r\nin Grand Pré?”\r\n\r\n“He lived in Grand Pré,” said the old man. “He was one of those that the\r\nEnglish drove away.”\r\n\r\n“And he must have been one of those who managed to come back again,”\r\n exclaimed Bart, eagerly. “I’ve heard that a great many found their way\r\nback from Massachusetts, from New York, from the Southern States, and\r\neven from the West India islands.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the old man, “but my grandfather was never carried away. He\r\nescaped, and ran for his life. He was pursued, and almost caught; but by\r\nGod’s help he was saved from his enemies, and came here, where he lived\r\nto grow old.”\r\n\r\n“Escaped?” said Bart. “O, how I wish you would tell us all about it!”\r\n\r\nThe old man smiled. The eager faces of all the boys showed how deeply\r\nthey were interested; and with such listeners as these it could not be\r\notherwise than pleasant to tell a story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\n_The Story of an Acadian Exile.--The Country in Flames.--A dread\r\nDiscovery.--Pursuit.--Flight over the Water.--The Bloodhound\r\nInstinct.--Red Sea Waves._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE story which the old man went on to tell the boys was long, and\r\nsubject to frequent interruptions, partly owing to his own emotion, and\r\npartly from the eager questions of his listeners. A direct report of his\r\nown words need not therefore be given here, but rather the material of\r\nhis narrative.\r\n\r\nGrousset, then, the grandfather of their host, was a young man at the\r\ntime of the expulsion of the Acadians. He was not married, but lived\r\nwith his father and mother in a place which, by close questioning, Bart\r\nconjectured could not have been far away from the very spot where the\r\nschool stood. As the old man had never been there himself, but had only\r\nto speak from hearsay, he could not, of course, give any very exact\r\ndescription of localities; and it was only from his general knowledge\r\nthat Bart was able to draw this conclusion. At any rate, the young\r\nGrousset lived here. There was one brother besides himself. They devoted\r\nthemselves to farming, chiefly, but they also went out fishing, whenever\r\nany good opportunity presented itself.\r\n\r\nTheir house was on the side of a hill which sloped towards the Basin of\r\nMinas. In front were extensive marshes, beyond which was a river, that\r\nemptied into the bay. Into this river ran another smaller stream, a\r\nlittle below the house. The principal part of the settlement was two\r\nor three miles away. Their house was a very comfortable one, their farm\r\nextensive, and a thriving orchard contributed something towards the\r\nluxuries of life.\r\n\r\nOn that day Grousset was out in his boat. He had been out for two days\r\nfishing. The fleet of schooners which was to convey the settlers away\r\nhad arrived before he left, but he had no idea whatever of their real\r\nintent. He supposed that they had come for the purpose of buying corn,\r\nor hay, or something of that sort; and he regarded them simply as a\r\nprobable market where he could sell his fish. With this belief he spent\r\nmuch longer time than usual, hoping to fill his boat, and thereby effect\r\na larger sale.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his fishing, he had gone well over towards the other\r\nside of the bay; and when at length he started on the return voyage,\r\nmuch time was taken up, and he could not go more than half way. He\r\nanchored for that night, and very early on the following day resumed his\r\nhomeward progress. As he drew nearer, he was astonished to find great\r\nclouds of smoke rolling over the whole country where the Grand Pré\r\nsettlement stood. He could not understand it. At first he thought it was\r\nthe woods; but as he drew nearer, he saw that the smoke came from the\r\ncultivated parts, and not from the woods. This puzzled him at first.\r\nHe had intended to sail at once for the mouth of the Gaspereaux River,\r\nwhere the fleet was; but these strange and unaccountable appearances\r\nexcited the deepest anxiety and alarm, and drove all thought of\r\ntraffic and money-making out of his mind. He changed the boat’s course,\r\ntherefore, and steered straight for his own home; for there, as well as\r\nelsewhere, the smoke clouds arose, and the terrible conflagration seemed\r\nto have extended over his father’s fields.\r\n\r\nHeading thus towards his own home, full of fear and anxiety, he drew\r\never nearer, but only to find his anxiety deepened as his progress\r\nincreased. Nearer and nearer still he came, until at last he could see\r\nthat every house and every barn had disappeared from the face of the\r\ncountry. The fire was not accidental--it had evidently been done on\r\npurpose; but this discovery was still more perplexing, for he could not\r\nimagine any possible cause that could give rise to such a deed.\r\n\r\nThe rising tide bore him onward rapidly, and soon his boat floated up\r\nthat river that ran past his father’s farm. There rose the hill-slope\r\nwhere his father’s house and out-houses had once stood; but now the\r\nhouse and out-houses had all vanished, and over the surface of the\r\nhill were spread the black traces of the devastating fires. Nor was\r\nthe desolation confined to this place. It extended everywhere. Every\r\nbuilding had disappeared. Every human habitation had vanished. The fire\r\nhad spared nothing. All had gone.\r\n\r\nGrousset stood in his boat, gazing with looks of horror upon the scene,\r\naltogether bewildered, overcome by this sudden blow, wondering in his\r\nbewilderment what might be the fate of his relatives, wondering where\r\nhis father was, and his mother, and whether behind this conflagration\r\nthere could possibly lurk some other calamity. With such feelings as\r\nthese he floated on, and did not even seek to bring his boat to the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a loud cry came to his ears. Looking in the direction whence\r\nthe cry came, he saw a figure crawl stealthily forth from a mud gully,\r\nand wave his hands towards him. Then the cry was repeated--\r\n\r\n“Pierre!”\r\n\r\nGrousset recognized the voice. It was his brother Paul. At once he\r\ndirected the boat towards the place, which he reached in a few minutes.\r\nHis brother plunged into the water, seized the boat, clambered in, and\r\nthen implored him to turn and fly.\r\n\r\nHis brother Paul was pale as death, and was covered with mud from head\r\nto foot. Pierre was so horrified by all that he had seen, and by his\r\nbrother’s appearance, that he could scarcely gasp out a question about\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Fly! fly!” cried Paul, “or we’re lost! It’s the English! They’ve burned\r\nall the settlement, and seized the people! They are carrying them away\r\nto another country as slaves! Father and mother are gone! I was a little\r\nlate at the place, and managed to escape. But fly! fly! for they are\r\nscouring the country, and if they see us, we are lost!”\r\n\r\nAt this frightful intelligence Pierre’s first impulse was to join his\r\nfather and mother, and suffer with them; but the impulse passed away,\r\nand the thought of the horrors of slavery and exile deterred him. Flight\r\nwas now his only thought--flight instant and immediate. The boat’s head\r\nwas turned, and Pierre now sought the bay as eagerly as a short time\r\nbefore he had sought the shore.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as Pierre retraced his course, he soon perceived that he was\r\ndiscovered. Over the marshes a number of men came running. They were\r\ndressed in red coats, and by this, even when far away, they could easily\r\nbe recognized as English soldiers. They gesticulated wildly towards him,\r\nand finally, on reaching the bank of the river, they discharged their\r\nmuskets at the boat. But by that time the fugitives had passed beyond\r\ntheir reach, and the shots, though fast and furious, did no damage, but\r\nonly urged them on to swifter flight, if possible; and to accomplish\r\nthis, the two brothers seized the oars, and sought by rowing to make\r\ngreater speed.\r\n\r\nThe pursuers stood for a time as though baffled, and then hurried away\r\nback to the rising ground.\r\n\r\n“They’ll pursue us,” said Paul, gloomily.\r\n\r\n“O, no,” said Pierre.\r\n\r\n“They’ll pursue us,” said Paul once more, obstinately; “you don’t know\r\ntheir malignity. They will not let one of us escape. They have gone for\r\na boat.”\r\n\r\nPierre said nothing. After what had occurred, how could he hope for\r\nany forbearance on the part of his enemies? There, as he sat rowing,\r\nappeared full before him the blackened fields of his father’s farm, the\r\ngaunt chimney that rose above the ruins of the house where he was born.\r\n\r\nFor some time the two brothers pulled at the oars, with their eyes fixed\r\nupon the desolated shore, speaking not a word, for the hearts of both\r\nwere too full. Pierre did not seek as yet to know the particulars of the\r\ndread tragedy whose results Paul had already stated, nor did Paul care\r\nto say anything more about an event upon which he scarcely dared to\r\nthink; so both pulled on in silence, until at length a cry from Paul\r\nstartled his brother.\r\n\r\n“They have a boat! They are chasing us;” he cried. “They are coming out\r\nof the creek!”\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking Pierre saw it. He saw a boat shooting out from a\r\ncreek which emptied into the river. They had already passed its mouth,\r\nand the boat was fully a mile behind them; but still it seemed too near\r\nfor safety, and almost too near for hope. They understood all at once.\r\nThe soldiers, intent on capturing them, had hurried back to the creek\r\nwhere the boats usually lay, and one of these they had seized. It was a\r\nboat like their own, and in it there were a half dozen soldiers, armed,\r\nand full of the bloodhound instinct of pursuit. Their own boat was\r\nloaded down with fish, and even the aid of the oars did not seem\r\nsufficient to draw them away from their pursuers.\r\n\r\nThere was one thing which had to be done immediately, and this thing was\r\nsuggested simultaneously to the minds of both of them. They must lighten\r\ntheir boat at all hazards. The fish were useless now; worse--they were\r\nan impediment.\r\n\r\n“Over with them!” shouted Pierre, still rowing with one hand while he\r\nflung out the fish with the other. But Paul had already begun to do\r\nthat very thing. Hearing Pierre’s words he passed his oar over to his\r\nbrother, and then, gathering the fish up in both hands, he flung\r\nthem out of the boat by armfuls. Meanwhile Pierre rowed with all his\r\nstrength, and at the same time the wind never ceased to bear the boat\r\nalong. But the same wind bore onward after them the boat of their\r\npursuers, and the two brothers watched with anxious eyes the progress of\r\nthose who followed on their track.\r\n\r\nAt last all the fish were flung overboard except about half a dozen,\r\nwhich were reserved for food. They felt the benefit of this very soon.\r\nGradually the distance between themselves and their pursuers increased.\r\nBy this time also the tide had turned, and swept them on at an ever\r\naccelerated rate of progress; and, although the same tide swept their\r\nenemies along after them, still their own speed was the greater, and\r\nevery minute served to increase their chance of escape. For the boats\r\nwere about equal in speed, and while their boat only had two inside, the\r\nother carried six, and therefore was over weighted in this race.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours passed away, and the united action of wind and tide had\r\ncarried onward pursuers and pursued many miles into the bay. There rose\r\nbefore them the frowning cliffs of Blomidon, and past this the current\r\nwas setting in a swift stream, by which they were borne along. Now, too,\r\nthe wind died away, and the tide alone remained. This caused a change\r\nfor the worse. Thus far the lightness of their boat had favored them, so\r\nthat their pursuers had fallen behind as much as four or five miles; but\r\nnow, when it came to drifting, this difference was no longer in their\r\nfavor, and the enemy, either from having caught a stronger current, or\r\nfrom some other reason, seemed to be slowly gaining upon them.\r\n\r\nThe question now arose, what was to be done? They could easily have\r\nlanded here, scaled the cliff, and escaped in the woods. But that was\r\nnot to be thought of except as a last resort. At all hazards they\r\nwished to keep the boat. If they fled to the woods their boat would\r\nbe captured, and their fate might be a miserable death. With the boat,\r\nhowever, they might hope not only to save their lives, but perhaps to\r\nfollow their friends, perhaps to rescue them; or at least, if such a\r\nthing as that should be beyond their powers, they could choose some new\r\nhome, and have the means of living from the water, till the land should\r\nbe ready to yield them sustenance. For these reasons they resolved to\r\ncling to the boat, and fly as long, and as far, as possible.\r\n\r\nBut however eager they were in their determination to escape, the enemy\r\nshowed a resolve to pursue which was as obstinate as theirs. As they\r\nfloated along they saw the other boat still following. The tide bore\r\nthem on, in its course, down through the Straits of Minas, beneath the\r\nfrowning cliffs that rise gloomily on one side, where Blomidon overhangs\r\nthe water, past the rocks all covered with sea-weed, past long, bare\r\nsand flats, past the giant cliffs, which, torn and riven by earthquake\r\nor by tempest, rise at the extremity of the straits, and onward into the\r\nwide Bay of Fundy.\r\n\r\nThey had hoped that in this place a breeze might arise, but their hopes\r\nwere disappointed. The water was smooth, and they were borne onward over\r\nan unruffled surface, by the strong tide, far down. Yet though there\r\nwas no wind, they at length encountered something which to them, in\r\nthat extremity, was no less welcome. Before them rose a wall of mist,\r\nshutting out all the scene beyond, hiding even the Haute, which lay so\r\nnear. Into the entrance of this dense fog bank they were borne by the\r\ntide; and soon all surrounding scenes, all prospect of rock, and cliff,\r\nand distant shore, and overhanging sky, and all sight of their\r\npursuers, were snatched from their eyes, and nothing remained but an\r\nall-surrounding blank, an opaque wall of unpenetrable fog.\r\n\r\nAt any other time such an occurrence would have plunged them into\r\ndespair, but now it raised them out of despair into hope. At first they\r\nthought of rowing in some direction, but a little discussion served to\r\ndismiss this thought from their minds. In the first place, they could\r\nnot tell in which direction to row; and in the second place, they\r\nthought that their pursuers would probably take to their oars, and if\r\nso, their best plan of escape would be to drift.\r\n\r\nHours had passed away since their flight commenced, and at length\r\ndarkness came on. That darkness was most intense. There was not the\r\nslightest light to alleviate the gloom. Still even this darkness was a\r\nrelief, for they felt more secure. In spite of the hope which they tried\r\nto entertain that their enemies had given up the chase, they could not\r\nget rid of a dark fear that they were still pursued, and a foreboding\r\nthat with the return of light they might see them. And as the darkness\r\nseemed to bring safety, they bore it with patience, and resignation, and\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nAll night long they drifted in this thick darkness. At last light came\r\nagain. But the light was dull and obscure, for the fog still enveloped\r\nthem. By this time they had lost all idea of locality, and could not\r\nconceive in what direction they were drifting. They knew, however, that\r\nwhile the falling tide would carry them down the bay, the refluent tide\r\nwould bear them back, and therefore hoped, when the fog lifted, that\r\nthey would find themselves somewhere near the land. The day that\r\nfollowed was a gloomy day indeed. The water was glassy. There was not a\r\nbreath of wind. Having nothing by which to judge of their motion, they\r\nseemed to be without motion, and to be floating on a stagnant sea. There\r\nwas no sight to meet their eyes through the dense surrounding fog, and\r\nno sound came to their ears through the wide, surrounding stillness.\r\n\r\nAt last the evening of that day came on, and the fog lessened. Land\r\nappeared on either side of them. Gradually the atmosphere cleared, and\r\nto their amazement they found themselves drifting up a long channel that\r\nseemed like a river. Up this river the tide seemed to run, carrying them\r\nwith it at a great rate of speed. As they went on the shores approached\r\nmore closely, the stream grew narrower and more winding; but still the\r\nswift waters lost nothing of their speed. The shores on either side were\r\na wilderness, covered with the primeval forest, with not a sign of any\r\nhuman habitation. The strangeness of the place and the suspense which\r\nthey felt at finding themselves here prevented them from trying to land.\r\nThey rather chose to drift onward, and allow themselves to be borne\r\nwherever the current might carry them.\r\n\r\nAt length darkness began to come on, and the fugitives thought that they\r\nhad drifted far enough. They therefore flung out the rude anchor which\r\nthey had in the boat. It caught, and their progress was stopped. They\r\nfelt safe at last. Here, in this remote place, no pursuer would follow\r\nthem, and they might rest. They had not slept during all the time of\r\ntheir flight, and were very greatly fatigued. It seemed to them that\r\nthe boat was safer than this unknown shore, and to sleep there at anchor\r\nfloating on the water would be better than in those unknown woods where\r\nwild beasts or prowling Indians might be lurking; and thus, as soon as\r\nthe boat came to anchor, they flung themselves down in the bottom, and\r\nwere soon in a sound sleep.\r\n\r\nTheir sleep was somewhat disturbed, and early on the following day they\r\nawaked. Pierre was up first, and he looked about in surprise. It was\r\nabout dawn, and in that morning twilight surrounding objects were as\r\nyet indistinct. The first thing that he noticed was, that the boat was\r\naground. The channel up which they had drifted on the preceding evening\r\nwas now bare of water--a wide expanse, like those red mud flats of Grand\r\nPré with which he was so familiar. These flats extended here above and\r\nbelow for miles, and on either side they ran for a great distance before\r\nthey touched the shore.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the midst of this survey, Pierre caught sight of an object\r\nwhich made his blood run cold, and caused his heart for a few moments to\r\nstop its beating. It was a dark object that appeared, on the mud flats,\r\nabout a mile away, down the channel.\r\n\r\nIt was a boat!\r\n\r\nThat boat, like his own, had grounded, and lay there on her side.\r\n\r\nCould that be the boat of their pursuers? Had they been followed all\r\nthis time, and all this distance, so remorselessly? It seemed like it.\r\nPerhaps his pursuers had become bewildered by the fog, or perhaps they\r\nhad allowed themselves to drift, as the surest way of keeping near to\r\nthe fugitives; but whatever the reason was, it seemed as though the same\r\ncurrents that had borne them away had carried the pursuers after them.\r\n\r\nAnd there it lay! It grew lighter as he looked, and then, as if to\r\nconfirm his worst fears, there suddenly appeared something which put an\r\nend to all doubt.\r\n\r\nA figure stood up in that boat. It was light enough to see the color of\r\nhis dress.\r\n\r\nIt was red.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he seen this than other figures appeared--red-coated\r\nfigures. They stood up. Pierre could no longer doubt. They were English\r\nsoldiers. Even as he looked they began to leap out from the boat,\r\nand run towards him. As he looked his eyes caught sight of something\r\nbeyond--something white--like a long, low, white wall; and from that far\r\ndistance there arose a low, droning sound, which struck a strange terror\r\ninto his soul.\r\n\r\nIn a moment he roused his brother. Paul stood up, and stared in the\r\ndirection where Pierre was pointing. He saw the wide, flat river bed\r\nuncovered. He saw the red-coated English soldiers.\r\n\r\nPierre looked all around to find the best place for refuge.\r\n\r\nOn his right there projected a wooded cliff, its sides rising\r\nprecipitously for fifty or sixty feet, and its summit covered with fir\r\ntrees. This was the nearest land. If they ran towards this they might\r\nget out of sight of their pursuers in a few minutes, and plunge into\r\nthe woods at a place where the cliff ended and the land sloped gradually\r\ndown. To this place he directed Paul’s attention; and then calling upon\r\nhim to follow, he leaped from the boat. Paul followed. The two brothers\r\nran with their utmost speed over the treacherous mud flats towards the\r\nshore behind the point.\r\n\r\nUp the channel, over the same treacherous mud flats, came their\r\npursuers, who, at this unexpected sight of their prey, seemed to be\r\nfilled with fresh fury. Seeing that prey about to escape, they fired\r\nafter them. Report after report sounded through the air and echoed along\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\nSix shots were thus fired, and then, as the last echo died out, there\r\narose another sound. It was that low, droning sound which had come to\r\nPierre’s ears before he left the boat but the sound was louder, and\r\ndeeper, and nearer, and more dreadful. It was a sound of wrath. It was\r\nthe voice of many waters! It was the sound of a pursuer more terrible\r\nthan man--the sound of the pitiless march of innumerable waves.\r\n\r\nThe cliff rose overhead. They had reached it; but before they passed\r\nbehind it they turned one glance at their pursuers. In that one glance a\r\nsight revealed itself which was never forgotten.\r\n\r\nFar down arose a wall of white foam, formed by the advancing tidal wave\r\nof the Bay of Fundy--a dread mass of surging billows, rolling up the\r\nchannel, extending all the way across. At the moment when they looked\r\nit had caught the boat and overwhelmed it, and then, in hungry fury,\r\nadvanced towards the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThey had heard it! They had seen it--that terrible pursuer, the\r\ntremendous, the inevitable! They stood still in horror. Escape was\r\nimpossible. On came the wave. Even the fugitives stood for a moment\r\noverwhelmed with the horror of that spectacle.\r\n\r\nOn came the wave!\r\n\r\nThe wall of white foam rose high. It rushed onward. It reared its\r\ncurling crest. It fell in thunderous fury upon the wretched victims of\r\nits wrath. One wild, despairing yell burst forth, and then all sounds\r\nwere drowned in the roar of the rolling waves.\r\n\r\nThe brothers fled. They reached the sloping bank, and clambered to a\r\nplace of safety, from which they looked with pallid faces upon those\r\nwaters, which, like the waves of the Red Sea, had saved the fugitives by\r\noverwhelming the pursuers.\r\n\r\nAfter this they wandered through the woods for some days, and finally\r\nmet with friendly Indians, with whom they went to the Miramichi.\r\n\r\nSuch is the substance of M. Grousset’s narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\n_The American Indian in a new Light.--The false Guide.--Solomon prepares\r\nfor Vengeance.--The Indian Chief.--Full Explanations._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT evening they had a bountiful repast, after which they slept well,\r\nand on the following morning an equally bountiful breakfast fortified\r\nthem for the work of the day. Soon after this they started down to the\r\nschooner to talk over their plans for the future.\r\n\r\nClose by the wharf stood the mills already mentioned, where now arose\r\nthe tumult and bustle generally prevalent there. Into the precincts of\r\nthis mill the boys strolled, and looked about upon the busy scene.\r\n\r\nThe scene was to Bart one of the most familiar possible, for all his\r\nearly life had been passed in a city of saw-mills, and the present\r\noccasion offered nothing that was new. To the other boys it was also\r\nmore or less familiar, and it was rather the animation of the spectacle\r\nbefore them than its novelty which attracted them. One thing, however,\r\nthere certainly was which seemed to all of them most singular and\r\nunaccountable.\r\n\r\nAs they looked upon the men who were at work in the mill and in the mill\r\nyard, they noticed that one after another of them was an Indian. To see\r\nan Indian engaged in such work as this seemed astonishing, for it\r\nhad been a fixed belief in their minds that no Indian will engage in\r\ncontinuous hard labor; yet here was a fact which contradicted all former\r\nopinions. What was more surprising was the gradual discovery that not\r\none, or two, or a few, but the whole gang of men at work in and about\r\nthe mill were of the same race.\r\n\r\nThey worked doggedly, ploddingly, industriously; some floating logs,\r\nsome carrying deals, some attaching the ropes to those logs that had to\r\nbe hauled up; all busy, none idling.\r\n\r\n“I never knew that Indians would work,” said Bart to Mr. Smith.\r\n\r\n“These Indians work very well,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Yes; and that is what is so astonishing. Of course I knew that Indians\r\nwill go through any amount of fatigue in the course of a hunting\r\nexpedition, but I have always heard that they are incapable of hard\r\nwork.”\r\n\r\n“Well, as to being incapable, I have my doubts about that,” said Mr.\r\nSmith. “They cannot be incapable; they are only unwilling. Continuous\r\ndrudgery like this does not suit them as a general thing. But these\r\nIndians don’t object. They work hard, never complain, and I have never\r\nhad any men who have given so little trouble.”\r\n\r\n“It seems very odd, though,” said Bart. “I’m sure no other Indians in\r\nthis country would be willing to work in this way. No amount of wages\r\nwould tempt them.”\r\n\r\n“No. That’s true. The fact is, these Indians belong to a different\r\ntribe.”\r\n\r\n“A different tribe?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. The Indians that you are acquainted with, who live in Nova Scotia\r\nand the greater part of New Brunswick, are called the Micmacs. These\r\nare called the Milicetes. The language of the two tribes is altogether\r\ndistinct; their traditions, manners, and customs also vary in many\r\nparticulars. Between the two tribes there is no intercourse and no\r\nfriendly feeling whatever. You see here with your own eyes how different\r\nthey must be from the other tribe, with which you are acquainted.”\r\n\r\nMidday came, and as the steam whistles sounded, all hands left off work\r\nand prepared for dinner. Their dinners had been brought to them by the\r\nsquaws of the tribe who had come to the mill bringing their pappooses\r\nwith them. Men, women, and children then sat in a circle, in the midst\r\nof the mill yard, and engaged in their midday repast, while the boys\r\nlooked on curiously from a distance.\r\n\r\nAmong these Indians there was one who had come up with the women, and\r\nseemed to have some sort of authority. He did not work in the mill,\r\nbut had the air and tone of one giving directions, to which the others\r\nyielded assent or obedience. There was something in this Indian which\r\nseemed familiar to Bart, though he could not account for it. He was the\r\nfirst who noticed him, and he mentioned it to the others; but they\r\nwere equally unable to do so. At length, as several of the boys grouped\r\nthemselves together, it seemed to Bart as though the Indian had some\r\nrecognition of them. There were Bart, and Phil, and Pat, and the two\r\nRawdons; and as the Indian looked up, he caught sight of them, with\r\nBart in the foreground. He started, and then turned his head away, and\r\nappeared to busy himself with something else.\r\n\r\nHe was a very old man, somewhat bent, his face seamed with a million\r\nwrinkles; but his figure was still strong, sinewy, and apparently\r\ncapable of undergoing fatigue or exertion to an indefinite extent. He\r\nturned away, as has been said, but every few moments he threw a furtive\r\nglance at the boys.\r\n\r\nAnd now it happened that Solomon came up from the schooner to ask\r\nwhether the boys were to get dinner on board or on shore. He came up to\r\nwhere the Indians were seated, and it was evident that they had never\r\nseen a negro before, for the advent of Solomon created an extraordinary\r\nsensation. The women drew back, the children screamed, the men stared,\r\nand all gave signs of unusual excitement. But among all, none showed\r\nsuch excitement as the old man already mentioned.\r\n\r\nAs Solomon drew near, he saw him first, and started to his feet,\r\nstaring at him with a face upon which there was a variety of contending\r\nexpressions; curiosity, wonder, uneasiness, alarm--all these were\r\nplainly visible at the same time on that old Indian’s face.\r\n\r\nBut the emotion of the Indian found its counterpart in that which was\r\nmanifested by Solomon, as the Indian caught sight of him and started\r\nto his feet. The attention of Solomon was arrested by that movement. He\r\nstopped short, and fixed his eyes upon the Indian. His hands clinched\r\nthemselves together; his lips compressed themselves; his limbs grew\r\nrigid; while his eyes seemed to glow like fire. Again the old man\r\nwas transformed; again that wonderful change took place from apparent\r\nfeebleness, and even decrepitude, to something which seemed like the\r\nbounding vigor and vehement energy of barbaric manhood. His chest\r\nheaved; he seemed like some wild beast, as he stood there, gathering up\r\nall his energies for one tremendous spring.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Indian saw it, and drew himself up to resist the\r\nassault. He fell back a step or two, and mechanically threw himself into\r\nan attitude of defence. His gesture was seen by his companions. They\r\nlooked up to where his eyes were turned, and they marked the threatening\r\nattitude of Solomon. In an instant every one of them started up to his\r\nfeet, and by one common movement put themselves in front of their old\r\ncompanion, as though to guard him from the attack of this unexpected\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nUpon the boys these singular proceedings produced different effects.\r\nBart and his companions in the woods at once recognized the truth. The\r\nold Indian was no other than their false guide, who had first turned\r\nupon them to attack them, and then fled, leaving them in the midst of\r\nthe trackless forest. This was the man who now appeared before them in\r\nthe midst of his own people, who certainly deserved some punishment\r\nfor all that he had done, but who seemed to be out of the reach of any\r\npunishment, unless, indeed, Solomon should take the law into his own\r\nhands. But Bruce and the others, who had never seen the Indian before,\r\nstood simply amazed, not knowing what to make of such a singular scene.\r\nThey had heard of the adventure in the woods with the Indian guide, but\r\nwhat they had heard did not suffice to afford them a clew to the affair\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments they stood thus, Solomon threatening, the Indians\r\nscowling, the boys looking on. But Solomon, though poised to spring,\r\nhesitated, as he saw all the enemies before him. Had it been only the\r\nold Indian, he would have leaped upon him at once; but with so many\r\nother Indians, it was a different matter. Very naturally, therefore,\r\nSolomon hesitated, and faltered, and sank down from his high pitch of\r\nfury, at thus being confronted with the impossible.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that Mr. Smith approached. He surveyed the scene\r\nwith surprise and anxiety, and walking forward, hastily he asked what\r\nit all meant. The advent of one thus clothed with authority produced an\r\ninstantaneous effect. The Indians turned away, and talked in low tones\r\nwith one another; Solomon subsided from his fighting attitude into one\r\nof vehement denunciation; and Bart proceeded to tell Mr. Smith the whole\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith listened to it all with the deepest interest.\r\n\r\n“It’s abominable of Sam,” said he, as Bart ended, “and if it had been\r\nany one else, I should like to have him punished. But with Sam it\r\nis different, and I can easily explain it. Sam is the chief of these\r\nMilicetes, and generally is all that a chief should be. The only trouble\r\nwith him is, that, like all Indians, he is fond of liquor. When he gets\r\nany, it makes him simply insane. He stays about here most of the time,\r\nand in this place he can’t get a single drop. Consequently he is a very\r\nsensible, dignified, and respectable Indian. He is looked up to with\r\nthe utmost respect by his people, and he and I agree perfectly well.\r\nUnfortunately, when he goes away, he generally manages to get liquor.\r\nHe can’t resist temptation. He went off, about a fortnight ago, to\r\nMiramichi, where you found him. Before starting with you, he supplied\r\nhimself with that unfortunate bottle of liquor. Had it not been for\r\nthat, you would have found him an admirable guide, and he would have\r\nbrought you here without any difficulty. But his bottle drove him crazy,\r\nand caused that wild outbreak. I don’t believe he remembers much about\r\nit himself. He must have come straight back to Shippegan after leaving\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nThis explanation proved highly satisfactory to the boys, who readily\r\nforgave the Indian for an outbreak that had been produced by such an\r\nunfortunate cause; and even Solomon, on learning that it had not been\r\nout of any malicious intention, consented to forego his vengeance.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Mr. Smith had some conversation with the Indian himself,\r\nwho, as he suspected, remembered nothing about his outbreak in the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nHe only remembered that he had engaged to go with the boys, and had got\r\nseparated from them, he knew not how. He expressed great sorrow, and\r\ntried, in his broken English, to explain and to apologize.\r\n\r\nThus this affair was all happily settled.\r\n\r\nThe boys spent one more day in Shippegan, and then prepared to depart.\r\nOn the following morning they bade adieu to Mr. Grousset and his amiable\r\nfamily, who begged them, with great earnestness, to visit them again,\r\nwhich they all promised to do. Mr. Smith accompanied them to the wharf,\r\nand shook hands with them all around. Up went the sails, the lines were\r\ncast off, and the Antelope passed down the long harbor and out into the\r\nbay.",
