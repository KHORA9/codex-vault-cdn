Kingston.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nThis is not a very long book, but the story is a good one.  Several\r\nfamilies have met together to have a picnic on a pleasant local beach.\r\nTo everyone's delight they are joined by Harry Merryweather, a\r\nmidshipman home on leave.  Harry and another youth, David Moreton, go\r\nfor a wander round the rocks, but are cut off by the strong tide.  The\r\nweather then turns very nasty, but the boys are able to swim to a\r\npassing boat containing an old man, Jefferies, and his young grandson,\r\nTristram.  The weather is now so bad they can't get back to the local\r\nharbour at Penmore.\r\n\r\nThere is an accident and young Tristram is lost overboard, and drowned.\r\n\r\nThey see a vessel, a brig, on her way down channel, but when they get to\r\nher they find she is an abandoned wreck.  More bad weather.  They are\r\nseen by a schooner about some bad business, who opens fire, probably to\r\ndestroy an unwanted witness to some crime.  The brig is sinking.  They\r\nmake a raft.  Old Jefferies dies.  They are picked up by a French\r\nschooner, which turns out to be a privateer.  At this point the story\r\ngets even more convoluted, and you will have to read the book to see\r\nwhat happens next, and how the boys eventually get home.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nADRIFT IN A BOAT, BY W.H.G. KINGSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE PICNIC ON THE SANDS--THE MIDSHIPMAN--HARRY MERRYWEATHER AND DAVID\r\nMORETON CAUGHT BY THE TIDE--THE ALARM.\r\n\r\nFew parts of the shores of old England present more beautiful and\r\nromantic scenery than is to be found on the coast of Cornwall.  There\r\nare deep bays, and bold headlands, and wild rocks, and lofty cliffs, and\r\nwooded heights, and bare downs, and yellow sands full of the most minute\r\nand delicate shells, so delicate that it is surprising how they could\r\nhave existed in the rough and boisterous ocean, and been cast up whole\r\nfrom the depths below.  In one of those beautiful bays, many years ago,\r\na large party was collected, on a bright afternoon in the early part of\r\nautumn.  Among the party were persons of all ages, but most of them were\r\nyoung, and all were apparently very busy.  Some were engaged in tending\r\na fire over which a pot was boiling, and others were collecting\r\ndrift-wood thrown up close under the cliff, with which to feed it.  Two\r\nor three young ladies, under the superintendence of a venerable matron,\r\nwere spreading a tablecloth, though the sand looked so smooth and clear\r\nthat it did not seem as if the most dainty of people could have required\r\none.  Several were very eager in unpacking sundry hampers and baskets,\r\nand in carrying the dishes and plates, and bottles of wine, and the\r\nnumerous other articles which they contained, to the tablecloth.  Two\r\nyoung ladies had volunteered to go with a couple of pails to fetch water\r\nfrom a spring which gushed out of the cliff, cool and fresh, at some\r\ndistance off, and two young gentlemen had offered to go and, assist\r\nthem, which was very kind in the young gentlemen, as they certainly\r\nbefore had not thought of troubling themselves about the matter.  To be\r\nsure the young ladies were very pretty and very agreeable, and it is\r\npossible that their companions might not have considered the trouble\r\nover-excessive.  The youngest members of the party were as busy as the\r\nrest, close down to the water collecting the beautiful shells which have\r\nbeen mentioned.  The shells were far too small to be picked up singly,\r\nand they therefore came provided with sheets of thick letter-paper, into\r\nwhich they swept them from off the sand where they had been left by the\r\nprevious high tide.  A loud shout from a hilarious old gentleman, who\r\nhad constituted himself director of the entertainment, and who claimed\r\nconsequently the right of making more noise than anybody else, or indeed\r\nthan all the rest put together, now summoned them up to the tablecloth,\r\nto which at the sound, with no lingering steps, they came, exhibiting\r\ntheir treasures on their arrival to their older friends.  The party\r\nforthwith began to seat themselves round the ample tablecloth, but they\r\ntook up a good deal more room than had it been spread on a table.  The\r\nvariety of attitudes they assumed was amusing.  The more elderly ladies\r\nsat very upright, with their plates on their laps; the younger ones who\r\nhad gone for the water, and their friends of the same age, managed to\r\nassume more graceful attitudes; while the young men who had been to\r\nschool and college, and had read how the Romans took their meals,\r\nstretched themselves out at the feet of the former, leaning on their\r\nelbows, and occasionally, when not actually engaged in conveying ham and\r\nchicken or pie to their mouths, giving glances at the bright and\r\nlaughing eyes above them.  The hilarious old gentleman tried kneeling,\r\nthat he might carve a round of beef placed before him, but soon found\r\nthat attitude anything but pleasant to his feelings; then he sat with\r\none side to the cloth, then with the other.  At last he scraped a trench\r\nin the sand sufficient to admit his outstretched legs, and, placing the\r\nbeef before him, carved vigorously away till all claimants were\r\nsupplied.  The younger boys and girls, tucking their legs under them\r\nlike Turks, speedily bestowed their undivided attention to the task of\r\nstowing away the good things spread out before their eyes.\r\n\r\n\"This is jolly, don't you think so, Mary?\" exclaimed a fine boy of about\r\nfourteen to a pretty little girl who sat next to him; \"there is only one\r\nthing wanting to make it perfect--Harry Merryweather ought to be here.\r\nHe wrote word that he expected to be with us this morning, and I told\r\nhim where the picnic was to take place, that should he be too late to\r\nget home, he might come here direct.  Oh, he is such a capital fellow,\r\nand now that he is in the navy, and has actually been in a battle, he\r\nwill have so much to tell us about.\"\r\n\r\nMary Rymer fully agreed with David Moreton, for Harry was a favourite\r\nwith every one who knew him.  Although Harry Merryweather had not\r\narrived for the picnic, his friends appeared to be enjoying themselves\r\nvery much, judging by the smiles and giggling and the chattering, and\r\nthe occasional shouts of laughter which arose when old Mr Tom Sowton,\r\nand florid, fat Mr Billy Burnaby, uttered some of their jokes.  Not\r\nthat they were the only people who uttered good things, but they were\r\nprofessed jokers, and seemed to consider it their duty to make people\r\nmerry; Mr Burnaby, indeed, if he could not make people laugh at what he\r\nsaid, made them laugh at what he did.\r\n\r\nThe party had come from various quarters in the neighbourhood, some from\r\na distance inland, in carriages, and two or three families who lived on\r\nor near the coast, in two pretty yachts, which lay at anchor in the bay.\r\nOne of them belonged to Mr Moreton, David's father, and the other to\r\nCaptain Rymer, with whose family David was as much at home as with his\r\nown; and he and his sisters looked upon Mary, Captain Rymer's daughter,\r\nquite in the light of a sister.  She was, indeed, a very charming little\r\ngirl, well worthy of their affections.  The first course of the picnic\r\nwas concluded--that is to say, the chickens, and hams, and pies, and\r\ncold beef, and tongues, and a few other substantials were pushed back;\r\nthe potatoes, which had been boiled in salt water, having been\r\npronounced excellent.  The tarts and cakes and fruit, peaches and figs\r\nand grapes, were brought to the front, and underwent the admiration they\r\ndeserved, when suddenly David Moreton, looking up, raised a loud shout,\r\nand, jumping to his feet, clapped his hands and waved them vehemently.\r\nThe shout was echoed in different keys by many others, and all turning\r\ntheir eyes in the direction David was pointing, they saw, on the top of\r\nthe cliff a boy, on whose jacket and cap the glitter of a little gold\r\nlace and his snow-white trousers proclaimed him to be that hero in\r\nembryo, a midshipman.  Having looked about him for a few seconds, he\r\nbegan to descend the cliff at so seemingly breakneck a speed, that\r\nseveral of the ladies shrieked out to him to take care, and Mary Rymer\r\nturned somewhat pale and stood looking anxiously as the young sailor\r\ndropped from one point of rock to another, or slid down a steep incline,\r\nor swung himself by the branches of shrubs or tufts of grass to the\r\nledge below him, and ran along it as if it had been a broad highway,\r\nthough a false step might have proved his destruction.  Once he stopped.\r\nTo go back was impossible, and to attempt to descend seemed almost\r\ncertain destruction.  Mr Sowton and Billy Burnaby jumped up, almost\r\ndragging away the tablecloth, upsetting tarts, and fruit-dishes, and\r\nbottles of wine, and all the other things, when Harry gave a tremendous\r\nspring to a ledge which his sharp eye had detected, and was in a few\r\nseconds afterwards standing safe on the sands and shaking hands warmly\r\nwith everybody present.  When he came to Mr Tom Sowton and Billy\r\nBurnaby, it might have been supposed from the way in which they wrung\r\neach other's hands, that there was a wager pending as to which should\r\nfirst twist off his friend's fist.\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately, we haven't eaten up all the good things, Harry,\" exclaimed\r\nMr Sowton, dragging the midshipman, nothing loth, to the well-spread\r\ncloth.  \"Now open your mouth, and Burnaby and I will try and feed you.\r\nWhat will you have first,--beef, or pudding, or a peach, or a tongue, or\r\na cold chicken?  Oh dear me, there is but a drumstick and a merrythought\r\nleft.  Which will you have?  No!  I see I am wrong again, the drumstick\r\nis in the dish, and the merrythought is in my head, with numerous\r\ncompanions.  Does anybody wish to know what they are?  I'll fill my\r\nnaval friend's plate first with cold beef and mustard, and then inform\r\nyou.\"  Thus the old gentleman ran on.  He kept his word with regard to\r\nHarry, who very soon by diligent application caught up the rest of the\r\nparty, and was able to commence on the tarts and peaches.  All the\r\ngentlemen asked him to take wine, and the ladies were eager to hear his\r\nadventures.  He briefly recounted them in an animated manner, for as he\r\nhad been little more than a year at sea, everything he had seen and done\r\nhad the freshness of novelty.  He belonged to the gallant _Arethusa_\r\nfrigate, which had put into Plymouth from a successful cruise in the Bay\r\nof Biscay, where, after capturing several minor prizes of considerable\r\nvalue, she had taken an enemy's frigate of equal force.  He had\r\nconsequently got leave for a few days to come home and see his widowed\r\nmother.  He was her only son; her husband had been an officer in the\r\narmy, and was killed in battle; her daughter Jane could never be induced\r\nto leave her, but they had promised to send Harry on to the picnic after\r\nhe had indulged them with a little of his society.  He had come by a\r\nchance conveyance, knowing that he should be able to return with some of\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\nIn those days it was the custom to sit long after dinner, and even at a\r\npicnic people consumed a considerable amount of time round the cloth.\r\nAt length, however, they got up and broke into separate parties.  Some\r\nwent in one direction, some in another.  The elders were more inclined\r\nto sit still, or went only a little way up the cliff; but several of the\r\ngrown-up young ladies and gentlemen climbed up by somewhat steep paths\r\nto the downs above.  The younger ones, the tide being low, very\r\nnaturally preferred scrambling out on the rocks in search of\r\nsea-anemones, and other marine curiosities.  There were numerous\r\nprojecting rocks forming small bays in the large bay, and thus\r\ncompletely hiding the different parties from each other.  No two boys\r\ncould have had a more sincere regard for each other than had David\r\nMoreton and Harry Merryweather.  David was longing to go to sea with\r\nHarry, but his father was greatly averse to his going.  He was the\r\neldest son, and heir to a large property.  As the boys had been\r\nseparated for so long a time (long in their lives), they had a great\r\ndeal to say to each other.  They consequently strolled away, forgetting\r\nwhat Mary Rymer or the rest of their fair companions might have thought\r\nof their gallantry, in and out along the sands, round the points and\r\nover the rocks, till they had got to a considerable distance from the\r\nplace where the picnic had been held.  A dry rock, high above the water,\r\nwhich they could reach by going along a ledge connecting it with the\r\nmainland, tempted them to scramble out to it.  There they chose a nice\r\ncosy, dry nook, where, sitting down, the water immediately around them\r\nwas hidden from their sight.  This circumstance must be remembered.  It\r\nwas very delightful.  They had not yet said one-half of what they had\r\ngot to say to each other, so they sat on talking eagerly, looking out\r\nseaward and watching the white sails which glided by coming up channel\r\nin the distant horizon.  David was so delighted with the accounts Harry\r\ngave him, that he resolved to make a further attempt to induce his\r\nfather to allow him to go to sea.  It must be owned that Harry, full of\r\nlife and happiness himself, had pictured only the bright side of\r\neverything.  He had described the courage and determination to win with\r\nwhich he and his shipmates had gone into action, and the enthusiasm and\r\ndelight they had felt on gaining the victory and capturing the prize;\r\nbut he forgot to speak of the death of some cut down in their prime, and\r\nthe wounds and sufferings of others, many maimed and crippled for life.\r\nThus they talked on without marking how the time went by.  Harry's\r\nwatch, which he had locked up carefully before going into action, had\r\nbeen destroyed by a shot which had knocked the desk and everything in it\r\nto pieces; and David had forgotten to wind his up.  Suddenly it occurred\r\nto them that the sun was getting very low, and that it was high time for\r\nthem to return.\r\n\r\nThey jumped up to scramble back over the rock, but no sooner had they\r\ndone so than Harry cried out, \"We are caught!\" and David exclaimed, \"The\r\ntide has risen tremendously, how shall we get to the shore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Swim there,\" answered Harry; \"I see no other way.  If we were to shout\r\never so loud we should not be heard, and I do not suppose any one knows\r\nwhere we are.\"  By this time they had got to the inner end of the rock,\r\nwhere they found that the distance between them and the shore was not\r\nonly considerable, but that a strong current swept round the rock, and\r\nthat though before the sea had been calm, it had got up somewhat, and\r\ncaused a surf to break on the shore.  What was to be done?  David was a\r\nfirst-rate swimmer, and would not have had much difficulty by himself in\r\nstemming the current, and landing through the surf; but Harry, though a\r\nsailor, had not learned that art before he went to sea, and could swim\r\nvery little.  It is extraordinary how many sailors in those days could\r\nnot swim, and lost their lives in consequence.  They stood looking at\r\nthe foaming, swirling waters, not knowing what to do.\r\n\r\n\"I would try it,\" said Harry at length, \"but I am afraid if I were to\r\ngive in that I should drown you as well as myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that I might support you, and we should drift in somewhere a\r\nlittle further down, perhaps,\" said David.\r\n\r\n\"Much more likely that we should be swept out to sea,\" answered Harry.\r\n\"No, no, David, that will never do.  You can swim on shore before the\r\nsurf gets heavier, and your father or Captain Rymer will send a boat for\r\nme very soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"But these are spring tides, and if the sea gets up at all, it will soon\r\nwash right over this rock,\" said David.\r\n\r\n\"The more reason for you to hurry to get a boat from the yachts,\"\r\nobserved the midshipman.\r\n\r\nWhile they were speaking, they observed the two yachts, which had\r\nhitherto been hid by a point of land, standing out to sea.  They had\r\ncome from the east with a fine northerly smooth water breeze, but the\r\nwind had drawn off shore to the east, and as the tide was at flood\r\nrunning up channel, the vessels had stood off shore to get the full\r\nstrength of it.  This the boys at once understood, but how they should\r\nhave gone off without them was the puzzle.  Matters were growing\r\nserious.  Even should David reach the shore, he might not find a boat,\r\nand it was a long way he feared from any house where he could get help,\r\nso that Harry might be lost before he could get back.  They retraced\r\ntheir steps to the highest part of the rock, and waved and shouted, even\r\nthough they knew that their voices could not be heard, but the yachts\r\nstood on at some distance from each other; it should be remarked,\r\nCaptain Rymer's leading.  It was evident that they were not seen.  The\r\nhot tide came rushing in, rising higher and higher.  Both the boys\r\nbecame very anxious, David more on his friend's account than his own.\r\nSo many persons have lost their lives much in the same way, that it\r\nseemed probable the two boys would lose theirs.\r\n\r\nWe must now go back to the picnic party.  Mr Sowton and Mr Burnaby,\r\nand a few of the other more elderly ladies and gentlemen, began at\r\nlength to think it time to return home.  The hampers were repacked and\r\ncarried, some up the cliffs by the servants, and others on board the\r\nyachts; and Mr Sowton and Billy Burnaby acting, as they said, as\r\nwhippers-in, began shouting and screeching at the top of their voices.\r\nCaptain Rymer and Mr Moreton had gone on board their vessels to get\r\nready, and thus there was no one actually in command.  The boats to take\r\noff the party were rather small, and several trips had to be made.  In\r\nthe meantime, those who were returning home by land climbed up the steep\r\npath to the top of the cliff, where their carriages were waiting for\r\nthem.  When they were fairly off, each party inquired what had become of\r\nHarry and David.  Captain Rymer's yacht, the _Arrow_, was off the first,\r\nfor the _Psyche_, Mr Moreton's, fouled her anchor, and it was some time\r\nbefore it could be got up.\r\n\r\nMr Moreton thought that his son, and the young midshipman had,\r\nattracted by sweet Mary Rymer, gone on board the _Arrow_; while Mary,\r\nwho, it must be owned, was rather sorry not to see them, took it for\r\ngranted that Harry was returning, as he had come, by land, and that\r\nDavid had gone with him.\r\n\r\nThe yachts had a long beat back.  As they got away from the land, the\r\nwind increased very much, and came in strong sharp cold gusts which made\r\nit necessary first to take in the gaff-topsails, and then one reef and\r\nthen another in the mainsails.  As the wind increased the sea got up,\r\nand the little vessels, more suited to fine weather than foul, had hard\r\nwork to look up to the rising gale.  Still there was no help for it.\r\nThe tide helped them along, but by its meeting the wind much more sea\r\nwas knocked up than if both had been going the same way.  Had such been\r\nthe case, the vessels could not have made good their passage.  Darkness\r\ncoming on made matters worse: poor old Mr Sowton became wonderfully\r\nsilent, and Mr Burnaby, who was sitting on the deck of the cabin,\r\nholding on by the leg of the table, looked the very picture of woe.\r\nMary Rymer, who was well accustomed to yachting, and a few others, kept\r\nup their spirits, though all hailed with no little satisfaction the\r\nlights which showed the entrance to Pencliffe harbour, into which they\r\nwere bound.\r\n\r\nMr Moreton's party had been at home some time, and most of the family\r\nhad retired to their rooms, when they began to wonder why David had not\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n\"He is probably still at the Rymers', or has accompanied Harry to Mrs\r\nMerryweather's,\" said Mrs Moreton to her husband; still, as night drew\r\non, she became somewhat anxious.  Her anxiety increased when a servant\r\ncame with a message from Mrs Merryweather to inquire why Mr Harry did\r\nnot come home.\r\n\r\nMr Moreton himself now became even more anxious than his wife.  Neither\r\nhis daughters, nor some friends staying with them, remembered seeing\r\neither Harry or David for some time before they embarked.\r\n\r\nMr Moreton, putting on a thick coat, for it was now blowing very hard,\r\nwent off to Captain Rymer's house, which was close down to the bay,\r\naccompanied by Mrs Merryweather's servant, and greatly alarmed the\r\nfamily by asking for his son and Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Why, did they not come back with you?\" asked the captain.  \"No, we\r\nthought they were on board the _Arrow_,\" answered Mr Moreton.  \"They\r\nmay have gone with the Trevanians, but I do not think that Harry would\r\nhave failed to come back to his mother.  I will go back and see her.\r\nThey must have set off by land, and there may have been an upset or a\r\nbreak-down.  It will be all right tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe morrow, however, came, but the boys did not appear.  Mr Moreton\r\ntherefore rode over early to the Trevanians, but they knew nothing of\r\nthe boys.\r\n\r\nHe now became seriously alarmed.  As it was blowing too hard to go by\r\nsea, he sent a messenger to say that he should not be home for some\r\nhours, and continued on to the bay where the picnic had been held.  Then\r\nhe made inquiries at the nearest cottages, but no one had seen his son\r\nor Harry Merryweather.  He went from cottage to cottage in vain, making\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\nAt last a fisherman suggested that the beach should be searched.  Mr\r\nMoreton at once set out with a party quickly assembled to perform the\r\nanxious task, dreading to find the mangled body of his son and his brave\r\nyoung friend.  No signs of them could be found.  Still his anxiety was\r\nin no respect lessened.\r\n\r\nHe stopped on his way back at one cottage which he had not before\r\nvisited.  He found the inmate, an old woman, in deep affliction.  Her\r\nhusband, old Jonathan Jefferies, a fisherman, when out on his calling,\r\nhad perished during the gale in the night.  He could sympathise with\r\nher, and as far as money help was concerned, he promised all in his\r\npower.  With an almost broken heart he returned home to give the sad\r\nnews to his wife and family.\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs Merryweather, she was even still more to be pitied.  To have\r\nher son restored to her, and then to find him snatched away again so\r\nsuddenly, perhaps for ever!\r\n\r\nDay after day passed by, and no news came of the much-loved missing\r\nones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nON THE ROCKS--A BRAVE LAD--SAVED--TRISTRAM'S FATE--STILL IN A BOAT.\r\n\r\n\"David, you must try to swim on shore, and save yourself,\" exclaimed\r\nHarry Merryweather, looking at the foaming seas, which now began, with a\r\ndeafening noise, to dash furiously round the rock on which he and his\r\nfriend stood.  \"If you don't go soon, you will not be able to get there\r\nat all.  Leave me, I beg you.  There is no reason why both should be\r\nlost.\"\r\n\r\n\"No indeed, that I will not,\" answered David, stoutly.  \"If I thought\r\nthat I could get help by trying to swim on shore I would go, but I do\r\nnot think there is a place near where I could find a boat.\"\r\n\r\nHarry did not speak for a minute or two.\r\n\r\nAt last he put his hand on David's shoulder, and said, \"I ask you again\r\nto swim on shore by yourself.  I will pray for you as you are swimming,\r\nand you shall pray for me when you reach the beach.  My dear mother\r\ntaught me to pray when I was a child, and she has ever shown to me that\r\nGod hears all faithful prayers, and in His good time grants them; so\r\nthat I have always prayed since I went to sea, both when I was turning\r\ninto my hammock, and when I was turning out; and I knew that my mother\r\nwas praying for me too, for she is always praying for me; and I know\r\nthat God hears those prayers, so you see that makes me very brave.  I am\r\nsure that I can trust Him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am so glad to hear you say that,\" answered David.  \"My father was\r\nteaching us just the same thing after reading the Bible at prayers the\r\nother night.  It's true--it's true, I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then trust to Him, and do as I ask you,\" said Harry, earnestly.  \"Take\r\noff your jacket and shoes at all events--you will be back in time to\r\nsave them and me also.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like leaving you at all, but I will do as you wish,\" exclaimed\r\nDavid, after a moment's further thought, taking off his jacket.  As he\r\ndid so he turned his head round seaward.  \"Hillo!--why, there is a\r\nboat,\" he exclaimed.  \"She is under sail, standing this way.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys together sprang back to the highest part of the rock, and David\r\nstill holding his jacket waved it vehemently.  It was a small\r\nfishing-boat, beating up from the westward.  She was then standing in\r\nfor the land, and Harry, whose nautical knowledge was not as yet\r\nby-the-bye very great, was doubtful where she would go about again\r\nbefore she got near enough for those on board to see them.  All they\r\ncould do was to wave and wave, and to shout--though their shouting,\r\nshrill as it was, would have been of no use.\r\n\r\nDavid, who really knew more about boat-sailing than his naval friend,\r\nexpressed his opinion that she was beating up for the little\r\nboat-harbour of Penmore, about two miles to the eastward.  How anxiously\r\nthey watched her, as the tide sweeping her along she drew nearer and\r\nnearer!  The wind, having--as the expression is--backed into the\r\nsouth-east, enabled her to lay up well along shore, or their hope of\r\nbeing seen would have been small indeed.  For some minutes longer she\r\nstood on almost directly for them; then at length she went about--high\r\ntime, too, for she was getting near the breakers.  Now was the moment\r\nfor them to shout and wave, for if they were now neither seen nor heard\r\nthey must abandon their hope of help from her, as by the next tack she\r\nwould be a long way to the eastward.  How eagerly they watched her!\r\nAgain and again they waved and shouted.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, see--she is about,\" cried Harry, joyfully.  He was right--the boat\r\nwas evidently standing towards them.  Harry, forgetting all past\r\ndangers, shouted and danced for joy.  Life was very sweet to him.  He\r\nthought nothing of the ordinary risk of losing it which he was every day\r\nrunning--but this was out of the way, and he had almost made up his mind\r\nthat he should not escape.  There were two people in the boat--an old\r\nman and a boy.  The sail was lowered, and getting out their oars they\r\napproached the rock cautiously.  It would have been excessively\r\ndangerous to get close, as a heavier sea than usual might have driven\r\nthe boat against the rock and dashed her to pieces.  This Harry and\r\nDavid saw.  The old man stood up in the boat, and beckoned to them.  He\r\nwas shouting also, but the thundering noise of the sea against the rock\r\nprevented them from hearing him.\r\n\r\n\"He wants us to swim out to the boats,\" said David.  \"I am sure that I\r\ncould do it, and I will bring in a rope for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do not think that you could,\" answered Harry.  \"The sea rolls in\r\nso heavily that you would be driven back.  They might let the end of a\r\nrope, made fast to a cork or a float of some sort, drift in, and haul us\r\noff.\"  The plan was clearly a good one, and they made signals to the old\r\nman to carry it out; but either he did not understand them, or had not a\r\nrope long enough.\r\n\r\n\"I must go,\" cried David, throwing off his coat and shoes.  \"Pray for\r\nme, remember.\"  He had been watching his opportunity: a heavy sea had\r\njust passed, and, before Harry could even say another word, slipping\r\ndown to the edge of the rock, he glided in, giving himself all the\r\nimpetus he could with his feet, and almost the next instant was\r\nbreasting a sea at some distance from the rock.  Harry watched him\r\nanxiously, not forgetting to pray.  Now he seemed almost driven back,\r\nand now a foam-crested sea rolling in looked as if it would inevitably\r\noverwhelm him.  Alas! yes--he disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"He is lost--he is lost!\" cried Harry.  But no.  Directly after he was\r\nagain seen on the surface, working his way up another advancing sea.\r\n\r\nHarry was now guided chiefly by the gesticulations of the people in the\r\nboat,--that is to say, by the way the old man waved a hand, or looked\r\nout, for they had to keep their oars moving with all their might and\r\nmain to avoid being driven dangerously near the rock.  At length Harry,\r\nwith thankfulness, saw David close to the boat but she seemed to be\r\ngoing from him--then the old man stood up--stretched out his arm, and\r\nDavid, well-nigh exhausted, was dragged into the boat.  Harry saw that\r\nhe was talking to the old man.\r\n\r\n\"What will he do?  I hope that he will not attempt to swim back to the\r\nrock,\" thought Harry; yet he felt very sure that he should never reach\r\nthe boat by himself.  As the boat rose on the top of a wave, Harry saw\r\nthat David was employed in fastening several ropes together.  The task\r\nwhich the old man and the boy could not perform, as they were obliged to\r\ncontinue rowing, he was able to do.  Harry saw him very busy in the\r\nbottom of the boat, and now he lifted a water-cask into the sea, and\r\nveered away the rope over the stern.  For some time Harry did not regain\r\nsight of the cask; at last he saw it on the top of a sea, but still a\r\nlong way from the rock.  He watched it anxiously; but still he doubted\r\nwhether he should be able to get hold of it.  It might, even if it\r\nreached the rock, be dashed to pieces.  He got down as close to the\r\nwater as he dared go, for the seas were dashing so high up the rock that\r\nhe might easily be carried away by them--indeed, he was already wet\r\nthrough and through with the spray, which was flying in dense sheets\r\nover the rock, and in a few minutes more it seemed to him that it would\r\nbe completely overwhelmed--indeed, any moment a sea might sweep over it.\r\nHarry had a brave heart, and as long as he had life was not likely to\r\nlose courage.  He showed his coolness, indeed, for believing that the\r\ncask would soon reach him, he deliberately tied David's jacket and shoes\r\nround his waist, that he might have the pleasure of restoring them to\r\nhim.  He had observed how David slipped into the water.  There came the\r\ncask, nearer and nearer.  Before it had time to touch the rock, he slid\r\ndown into the sea, and struck out boldly for it, and throwing his arms\r\nover it caught the rope to which it was made fast, and drew himself up\r\ntill his chest rested on it.\r\n\r\nHe then shouted at the top of his voice, \"Haul in--all right.\"  David,\r\nhowever, could not hear him: but having watched him with intense\r\neagerness, now began slowly to haul in the rope, while the old man and\r\nboy pulled the boat further off the rock.  Harry held firmly on, though\r\nhe almost lost his breath by the waters, which dashed in his face.  He\r\nkept his senses, however, and had the wisdom to strike out with all his\r\nmight with his feet, which greatly helped him on, and took off the drag\r\nfrom his arms which they would otherwise have felt.\r\n\r\nAs he rose to the top of a sea he again shouted out every now and then,\r\n\"All right--haul away.\"  He was, however, not much inclined to shout by\r\nthe time he got up to the stern of the boat.  David, with the help of\r\nthe old man, then quickly hauled him on board.\r\n\r\n\"And you have brought me my jacket and shoes,\" exclaimed David, gladly\r\nputting them on, for he felt very cold directly the exertions he had\r\njust gone through ceased.  The boys sincerely thanked God in their\r\nhearts that they were saved--though but a very few audible words of\r\nthanksgiving were uttered.  No time, indeed, was to be lost in getting\r\naway from the rock.\r\n\r\nThe old man told David to go to the helm.  \"And you other young master\r\ntake my oar and pull with all your might, while I sets the sails,\" he\r\nadded.  A sprit-mainsail, much the worse for wear, and a little rag of a\r\nforesail were soon set.  It was as much sail as the boat in the rising\r\ngale could carry, and away she flew seaward.  The old man took the helm,\r\nand the boy, who had not spoken, laid in his oar, and facing forward,\r\nput his hand on the foresheet to be ready to go about when the word was\r\ngiven.  The boat was somewhat old and battered, like its master,--the\r\nrigging especially seemed in a bad condition.\r\n\r\nThe old man saw the boys examining her, and divined their thoughts.\r\n\"She's not like one of your fine-painted yachts, young masters; but she\r\nhas helped to save your lives, and she'll serve my time, I'm pretty sure\r\nof that,\" he observed.  \"She'll be tried, howsomever, not a little\r\nto-night, I'm thinking.  We were late as it was coming up from `Put off\r\nshoal,' and this work with you made us still later, so that we shall\r\nhave to be thankful if we get into Penmore harbour before the tide\r\nturns.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is a good boat, no doubt, and at all events we are most thankful to\r\nyou for having by her means saved our lives,\" said David; and Harry\r\nrepeated what he had said.\r\n\r\n\"No, young masters, it wasn't I saved you, it was God.  Don't thank me.\r\nMan can do no good thing of himself, you know, and I couldn't have saved\r\nyou if it hadn't been His will.\"  The fishing-boat went careering on\r\nover the foaming seas, guided by the skilful hand of the old man.  It is\r\nsurprising how much sea a small boat with good beam will go through when\r\nwell managed.  The old man was far more loquacious than the young one,\r\nwho sat quite still forward, only every now and then turning his face\r\naside as the spray dashed in it, and shaking the water from his\r\nsou'-wester.\r\n\r\nTo the boys' inquiry of the old man to which place he belonged, \"Little\r\nbetter than a mile to the eastward of where I took you aboard,\" he\r\nreplied; \"but when the wind blows as it does now, there's no place for\r\nlanding nearer than Penmore harbour.  That matters nothing, as we get a\r\ngood market for our fish near there, and we have a good lot to sell, you\r\nsee.\"  He pointed to the baskets in the centre of the boat, well filled\r\nwith mackerel and several other kinds of fish.  He told them that his\r\nname was Jonathan Jefferies, that he had married a Cornish woman, and\r\nsettled in the parish, and that the lad was his grandson.  \"Not quite\r\nright up there,\" he remarked, touching his forehead; \"but he is a good\r\nlad, and knows how to do his duty.  We call him Tristram Torr, for he is\r\nour daughter's son.  She is dead, poor thing, and his father was lost at\r\nsea, we suppose, for he went away and never came back.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man thus continued giving scraps of his family history, till the\r\ngloom of evening gave way to the darkness of night.  His chief regret at\r\nbeing out so late was that his old woman would be looking for him, as he\r\nhad told her that he expected to be home earlier than usual.  The darker\r\nit grew the less talkative, however, he became; indeed, all his\r\nattention was taken up in steering, for with the darkness the wind and\r\nsea increased, till the boat could hardly look up to it.  At last Harry\r\nand David began to suspect that though they had escaped from the rock,\r\nthey were in no small danger of being swamped, and thus, after all,\r\nlosing their lives.  Every now and then a heavy sea broke into the boat\r\nand half filled her.  Still the boy Tristram said nothing, but turning\r\nround took a bailer from under the thwart, and began energetically\r\nbailing away.  Harry and David did the same with their hats, till old\r\nJefferies handed them a bucket, with which they more rapidly cleared the\r\nboat.  They had to be quick about it, for scarcely was she free of water\r\nthan another sea came in and again half filled her.  It seemed also\r\npretty evident to them that instead of going to windward she was making\r\nleeway, though, as the tide was still running to the eastward, she was\r\ngoing in that direction.  The two boys were feeling thoroughly chilled\r\nand uncomfortable; they were, of course, wet to the skin, and the wind\r\nwas strong and keen, and even when they sat down, by the old man's\r\nadvice, in the bottom of the boat, their legs were in water.  Still they\r\nkept up their spirits, and when the water washed into the boat they were\r\nglad to jump up and bail it out again.  Besides that they were in danger\r\nof being swamped, it appeared to the midshipman and his friend that\r\nthere was a great risk of being run down.  Already two or three\r\nphantom-like forms had suddenly appeared out of the darkness, and\r\ngliding by were soon lost to sight.\r\n\r\nThe boy, however, had made no remark about them; suddenly he shouted,\r\n\"Grandfather, a sail on the weather-bow.\"\r\n\r\n\"About, then,\" cried the old man.  Harry and David looked out, and saw,\r\nalmost ahead of them, towering to the skies it seemed, a dark pyramid of\r\ncanvas.\r\n\r\n\"She is a big ship running down channel,\" said Harry.  \"She will be over\r\nus! she will be over us!\"  The boat was at that moment in stays, going\r\nabout.  Scarcely had he spoken, when there was a loud crack.  The mast\r\nwent by the board, and as it came down struck the old man on the head.\r\nHe would have fallen overboard had not Harry and David seized his coat\r\nand dragged him in.\r\n\r\n\"Here, pull, masters,\" cried Tristram, trying to get out both the oars.\r\nIn doing so he let one of them go overboard; both would have gone had\r\nnot Harry, springing forward, seized the other.  But poor Tristram, in\r\nendeavouring to regain the one he had lost, overbalanced himself, and\r\nmet the fate his grandfather had just escaped.  Harry threw the oar over\r\nto the side on which he had fallen, but the poor lad in vain endeavoured\r\nto clutch it.  There was a piercing cry; Harry thought he saw a hand\r\nraised up through the darkness, and then he neither saw nor heard more.\r\n\r\nHow came it that the boy's cry did not rouse the grandfather?  Sad to\r\nsay, he lay without moving at the bottom of the boat.\r\n\r\n\"This is fearful,\" cried David, feeling the old man's face and hands; \"I\r\nam afraid that he is dead, and the poor lad gone too.  What are we to\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep the boat's head to the sea as long as we can with one oar, and\r\nthen up helm and run before the wind,\" answered Harry, who knew that\r\nsuch was the way a big ship would be managed under similar\r\ncircumstances.  David sat at the helm, and Harry vigorously plied his\r\noar--now on one side, now on the other, and thus managed to keep the\r\nboat from getting broadside to the sea.  It was very hard work, however,\r\nand he felt that, even though relieved by David, it could not be kept up\r\nall night.  Several times David felt the old man's face; it was still\r\nwarm, but there was no other sign of life.  The boat was broad and deep,\r\nor she would very quickly have been turned over.  This, however, made\r\nher very heavy to pull, while from the same cause the sea continually\r\nwashed into her.  At length they agreed that she must be put before the\r\nwind.  They waited for a lull, and then getting her quickly round,\r\nhoisted the jib, which had been before taken in, to the end of the\r\nspreet, which they lashed to the stump of the mast.  The wind blew as\r\nstrong as ever, but the tide having turned there was less sea than\r\nbefore, and thus away they went down channel, at a far greater rate than\r\nthey supposed.\r\n\r\n\"It is going to be only a summer gale,\" observed Harry.  \"When the\r\nmorning comes we shall be easily able to rig a fore and aft sail, and\r\nstand in for the shore.  The poor, good old man, I am very sorry for\r\nhim, and so I am for the boy; but for ourselves it does not so much\r\nmatter, except that we shall have to breakfast on raw fish, and perhaps\r\nafter all not get home to dinner.  My dear mother, too, and Jane, may be\r\nfrightened, and I don't like the thought of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to be sure, I forgot that; I am afraid those at my home will be\r\nfrightened too, when they hear nothing of us,\" said David.  \"One comfort\r\nis, that we did not keep away intentionally, though, to be sure, it was\r\nthoughtless of us to be caught by the tide as we were.  But don't let us\r\nthink of ourselves; better let us see what we can do for this poor old\r\nman.  I believe that he is still alive, though how to bring him round I\r\ndon't know.  If we had any liquor to give him we might pour it down his\r\nthroat, but as we have nothing we must keep his head up and let him lay\r\nquiet till daylight,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\nDavid was thoroughly accustomed to boat-sailing, so that he was well\r\nable to keep the boat dead before the wind.  The sea came curling up\r\nastern, but none broke over her; had even one done so it would have sent\r\nher to the bottom.  A very little conversation took place after this.\r\nOnly Harry, fearing that he and his friend might lose heart, every now\r\nand then said something to keep up their spirits.  It was somewhat\r\nforced, it must be owned, for they both saw that their position was very\r\ncritical.  The hours passed slowly by--now the one, now the other took\r\nthe helm.  Morning broke at last; they looked out, expecting to see the\r\nland aboard on the starboard hand, but not a glimpse of land was\r\nvisible--nothing but sea and sky on every side around of a leaden grey\r\nhue--not a streak in the horizon showed where the sun was rising.  They\r\ncould only guess by the wind the points of the compass.  Harry proposed\r\nhauling up for where they supposed the land to be, but David considered\r\nthat such a proceeding would be dangerous, and that it would be safer to\r\nrun on till the weather moderated and they could get sail on the boat.\r\nThey neither of them sufficiently calculated the strength of the tide,\r\nwhich, running for six hours, had carried them many miles to the\r\neastward.  The old man was alive, but sat perfectly still at the bottom\r\nof the boat.  It seemed indeed doubtful if, after remaining in that\r\nstate so long, he would ever recover.  Their anxiety prevented them from\r\nfeeling hungry; indeed, as yet, they fancied that they could not bring\r\nthemselves to eat raw fish.  They now tried various means to bring the\r\nold man to consciousness, by rubbing his hands and his feet, and\r\noccasionally his forehead.  It is difficult to say whether these means\r\nhad any effect.  At length, at all events, he slowly opened his eyes;\r\nthen he closed them again, and they thought that he was dying.  Then\r\nonce more he opened them, and looked about him with a puzzled and pained\r\nexpression of countenance.  Now he gazed inquiringly at David--now at\r\nHarry.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Tristram? where is my grandson?\" he asked, speaking very\r\nslowly.  \"Gone! gone! oh, don't say that.  What have you done with him,\r\nmy young masters?\"\r\n\r\nWith sad hearts the boys told him how the accident had happened.\r\n\r\n\"Then may God take me to my boy, my poor boy,\" he exclaimed hiding his\r\nface in his hands, and sinking back once more into the bottom of the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nWHERE WERE THEY?--RAW FISH--SLEEP--THE BRIG WITHOUT A CREW--AN AGED\r\nCHRISTIAN.\r\n\r\nThe gale continued blowing harder than ever, and had not the boat been\r\nbuilt especially to encounter heavy seas, she would very soon have been\r\nswamped.  It was only by careful steering, indeed, that this could be\r\navoided, while the two boys took it by turns to bail out the water which\r\noccasionally came in over the gunwale in rather alarming quantities.\r\nStill they did not lose courage.  They, however, grew very hungry, and\r\nbegan to look wistfully at the hamper of fish.\r\n\r\n\"I wish we had a stove of some sort, that we might cook some of these\r\nfish,\" said David, holding up a mackerel.  \"I am getting fearfully\r\nravenous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just scrape off the scales and take out the inside of one of them, and\r\nhand it to me,\" answered Harry, who was steering.  \"I have seen seamen\r\neat raw fish, and raw meat too, and the islanders in the South Seas I\r\nknow do, so we must if we are not to starve.\"\r\n\r\nDavid prepared the fish as directed, during the intervals of bailing.\r\nStill he could not bring himself to eat any.  Harry's inside was more\r\nseasoned.  A midshipman's berth in those days did not allow of any\r\nsqueamishness.\r\n\r\n\"Just pour a little water into the tin mug, it will help it down,\" he\r\nsaid, after he had taken a few mouthfuls of the fish.\r\n\r\nThey had found a tin mug, with a jar of fresh water.  They husbanded the\r\nwater carefully, and David poured out very little, lest it should be\r\njerked out of the mug as the boat was tossed about.  Harry dipped the\r\nbits of fish into the water before eating them.  It took away somewhat\r\nof the raw taste, he fancied.  Still he very soon came to an end of his\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\n\"I shall do better another time,\" he observed, putting the remainder of\r\nthe fish down by his side, and drinking up the water.\r\n\r\nDavid sat for some time very silent, bailing out the water.  At last he\r\nlooked into the basket and took out a fish, which he began to scrape\r\nwith his knife.  He held it in one hand while he bailed with the other,\r\nthen he scraped a little more, and finally cleaned the fish completely.\r\nHe looked at it, his lips curled, as is often the case when a person is\r\nabout to take nauseous physic.  A pang came into his inside.  He could\r\nstand the hunger no longer, and, putting the fish between his teeth, he\r\nbegan to gnaw away at a great rate.  He far outdid Harry.  When the\r\nwater rose to the side of the boat, he dipped the fish into it.  It\r\nadded to the flavour, and made it more digestible.  The boys were\r\nthankful that there was not much risk of their starving as long as the\r\nfish kept good and the water lasted.  It was not food that would keep\r\nthem in health for any length of time; yet it stopped the pangs of\r\nhunger, and that was a great thing.  All this time they were looking out\r\nfor some abatement in the gale, but not a break appeared in the mass of\r\ndark lead-coloured clouds which formed a canopy above their heads,\r\nreaching down to the horizon on every side.\r\n\r\n\"Whereabouts do you think we are?\" asked David, after a long silence.\r\n\r\nHarry thought for some time.\r\n\r\n\"Somewhere in the chops of the British Channel, to the westward of\r\nScilly, I fear,\" he answered.  \"Possibly, if the wind shifts to the\r\nsouthward, we may get driven up the Irish Channel, and then it will be a\r\ntremendous time before we get home; I may be wrong, but I fear not.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I think too,\" said David.  \"I wish that the old man was\r\nsensible.  We might consult him what to do.\"\r\n\r\nOld Jefferies, however, continued in the same unconscious state as\r\nbefore.  They had some hope of getting assistance from any vessels which\r\nmight pass them, but though they saw a number at a distance gliding\r\nquickly by, not one came near them.  On they drove, further and further\r\nthey feared from land.  Again darkness came on.  They were very drowsy,\r\nbut they feared, should they yield to sleep, that the boat would be\r\nswamped.  Harry had, he said, more practice in keeping awake, so he\r\ninsisted that David should lie down on one of the thwarts and take an\r\nhour's rest, while he could steer and bail out at the same time.\r\n\r\n\"I can manage it,\" answered David, with a yawn, stretching himself out\r\non a seat, and in less than half a minute he was sound asleep.\r\n\r\nPoor Harry had very hard work to keep awake.  He could not venture to\r\nremain sitting.  More than once his eyes closed.  Phantom shapes passed\r\nbefore his eyes, strange sounds came into his ears, shrieks, cries, and\r\ngroans; sometimes he heard, he thought, shouts from afar.  His brain\r\nswam round.  In another instant he would have lost all consciousness.\r\nHe had to spring to his feet, and to bail away with one hand while he\r\nheld the tiller with the other.  He would not venture to sit down again;\r\nindeed, the high, green, rolling, froth-topped seas, by which he was\r\nsurrounded, were sufficient to keep him awake.  At last, putting down\r\nthe skid, he looked at his watch.  It was past six o'clock.  David had\r\nslept more than his allotted hour, and yet he could scarcely bring\r\nhimself to awake him.\r\n\r\n\"Poor fellow, he is not so accustomed to this sort of work as I am,\" he\r\nsaid to himself.  \"After that long swim, too, he requires rest, and had\r\nit not been for his courage I should no longer have been in this world.\r\nI'll try and keep awake a little longer.\"\r\n\r\nHarry did his best to do as he intended.  He kept moving his feet, he\r\ntalked aloud, he sang even.  He looked at old Jefferies.  He thought he\r\nwas nodding his head and answering him, but he could not make out what\r\nwas said.  At last he felt that, if David did not wake up and come to\r\nhis relief, he should drop down, and the boat would broach to, and they\r\nwould all be drowned.\r\n\r\n\"David!  David!\" he tried to cry out, but his tongue seemed to cleave to\r\nthe roof of his mouth.  Still he kept the tiller in his hand, striving\r\nsteadily.  He made one more effort.  \"David! help! help!\" he shouted.\r\nDavid's mind was far away in his father's garden, with his sisters and\r\nsweet Mary Rymer.  He was telling them about Harry being in danger, but\r\nhe had forgotten he was with his friend.  At last he heard himself\r\ncalled.  He started up, and was just in time to seize the tiller, which\r\nHarry had that instant let slip from his grasp, as he sank down to the\r\nbottom of the boat.  In another second of time the boat would have\r\nbroached to.  The gloom of evening was coming on rapidly, and there was\r\nbut a dreary prospect for poor David.  He still felt very sleepy, and\r\nhad almost as much difficulty in keeping awake as before.  He managed to\r\ndrag Harry to one side, and to place some of the nets under his head as\r\na pillow, but no moving had the effect of rousing him up.  David felt as\r\nhe had never felt before; sitting there, the only being conscious of\r\nexternal affairs in that lone boat, running on amidst those huge\r\nbillows.  As long as the gale continued, on the boat must go, he well\r\nknew, or run almost the certainty of being swamped.  The short sleep he\r\nhad enjoyed had refreshed him, and he thought that he should now be able\r\nto keep awake.  He felt very hungry, though.  No wonder!  Most people\r\nwould have been hungry who had eaten nothing but raw fish during upwards\r\nof twenty-four hours.  He, however, would now have been very glad to get\r\nsome more raw fish, but he could not reach the hamper, and he dared not\r\nleave the helm for an instant.  There was a locker under where he sat.\r\nHe had just bailed out the boat, when stooping down, he put his hand in,\r\nand, feeling round, discovered to his great joy a large piece of bread,\r\nthe best part of a quartern loaf.  It was very stale, but he was not\r\ninclined to be particular.  Never had he tasted bread so sweet.  He\r\ntook, though, only a small portion, as he did not like to eat more\r\nwithout having Harry to share it with him, or old Jefferies, if he could\r\nbe aroused.  The bread, with a little fresh water, greatly revived him.\r\nHe thought, indeed, that he should be able to keep awake all the night,\r\nif Harry should sleep on.  He tried his best.  He stood up, then he\r\nbailed, but as much less water came into the boat than before, he had\r\nbut little to do in that way.  He tried to sing and whistle, but the\r\ntunes were somewhat melancholy.  The wind was certainly decreasing, and\r\nthe sea going down.  \"I must wake up Harry, and then, if we can but\r\nmanage to rig a fore and aft sail, we might haul our wind, and stand to\r\nthe north-east,\" he said to himself.  \"But which is the north-east, I\r\nwonder?  The wind may have changed, and there is not a break in the\r\nclouds.  Without a compass, how can we find our way?  If the clouds\r\nclear away, the stars would help us--at least, I suppose Harry knows all\r\nabout them.  I wish that I did.  But I was lazy, and to this moment am\r\nnot quite certain as to the look of the Polar Bear.  I remember that the\r\nNorth Star is in that.  However, we could not do much yet, and, with her\r\nbeam to the sea, the boat would not be steady enough to rig our mast\r\nproperly.  We must wait patiently till morning.  Dear me, how heavy my\r\nhead feels!  They must be all wondering what has become of us at home.\r\nI hope they don't think we are lost.  That is the worst part of the\r\nbusiness.  It will not be pleasant to live upon raw fish for very long,\r\nbut I suppose that it will keep us alive, and probably we shall fall in\r\nwith some vessel or other, which will tow us home.  That will be very\r\nnice.  What a pleasant picnic we had, and Harry to come home just in\r\ntime, and Mary Rymer, and what a dear--oh! how pleasant--how--\" Poor\r\nDavid was asleep.  No wonder, after having been awake for so many hours,\r\nand only just a little more than one hour's rest on a hard plank.  He\r\nstill held the tiller, and instinctively moved it to or from him, as he\r\nfelt the boat inclined to broach to.  His eyes, indeed, were not quite\r\nclosed, so that in reality he saw the seas as they rolled before him,\r\nand perhaps steered almost as well as he had done before.  Meantime the\r\nold man remained in a state of stupor, and Harry slept as soundly as a\r\n\"church door,\" or rather as midshipmen are generally supposed to do.\r\nThus the boat must have gone on for hours.  Happily, the wind and sea\r\nwere going down, or it would have been a serious matter to the boys.  It\r\nwill be understood that, after an easterly gale in the Channel, the sea\r\ngoes down more rapidly than after a westerly one, when there has been a\r\ncommotion across the whole sweep of the Atlantic.  Suddenly a loud\r\nconcussion and a continued grating sound made both David and Harry start\r\nto their feet, and they saw what seemed a huge black mass towering above\r\nthem.  What could it be?\r\n\r\n\"A ship! a ship!\" shouted Harry.  \"Heave a rope here!\"\r\n\r\nNo one answered.  As the boat was slowly rubbing by the side of the ship\r\n(for Harry was right in his conjecture), he found a rope hanging\r\noverboard.  With the activity of a seaman he secured the end round the\r\nfore-thwart of the boat, while David hauled down the sail--not that that\r\nwas of any consequence, as the wind had fallen almost to a calm.  Again\r\nHarry, joined by David, shouted loudly, but no one answered.\r\n\r\n\"I believe the ship is abandoned,\" he observed.  \"Yes, I am sure she is,\r\nfor I see no masts.  She is not quite so large, either, as I thought at\r\nfirst--a brig probably.  However, we shall soon have daylight, and know\r\nall about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe dawn was already breaking, but no roseate hue was seen in the sky,\r\nto indicate the position of the rising sun.  Although the sea had gone\r\ndown greatly, still the boat struck heavily every now and then against\r\nthe vessel, as she rolled slowly from side to side.  There was, indeed,\r\ngreat danger that she would be stove in, if not altogether swamped.  The\r\nboys, therefore, agreed that the sooner they could get on board the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\"We shall find some food, at all events; and if we can get nothing more,\r\nwe may shove off again,\" observed David.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  I hope we shall get much more than that,\" exclaimed Harry, in a\r\nconfident tone.  \"What do you think of a compass, and sail, and spars,\r\nand rigging for our boat, and if so we shall without difficulty be able\r\nto find our way home.  Hurrah! what do you think of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not fancy that we were likely to be so fortunate,\" answered\r\nDavid.  \"To think that we should have run directly against a ship out in\r\nthe ocean here!  What shall we do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, get on board ourselves, and then hoist the old man up,\" answered\r\nHarry.  \"We must not leave him in the boat, lest she should get stove\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys quickly scrambled up the ship's side.  Both her masts were\r\ngone, and the bowsprit had been carried away, with a considerable\r\nportion of the bulwarks, when the masts fell, and all her boats and\r\ncaboose.  Altogether she had a very forlorn appearance, while there was\r\nno sign of a human being on board.  Their first care was to get up the\r\nold man.  Harry leaped down into the cabin of the brig, and instantly\r\nreturned with a long horsehair sofa cushion.  \"We must pass straps round\r\nthis, and parbuckle him up,\" he observed.  Fortunately a davit remained.\r\nTo this they secured a tackle, and David, jumping into the boat to pass\r\nthe cushion under old Jefferies, they soon had him up safe on deck.\r\nThey then, having got up the hamper of fish, with the bread and the jar\r\nof water, veered the boat away with a hawser astern.  They were now able\r\nfor the first time to attend to the old man.  They examined his head,\r\nand finding where he had been struck, bathed the place with water, and\r\nthey also poured a few drops of water down his throat.  This seemed to\r\nrevive him greatly, and at last they thought that they might leave him,\r\nto examine the vessel.  The cold dull grey light of the early morning\r\nenabled them to do so.  The brig had not long been deserted, and great\r\nwas their satisfaction to find all sorts of things to eat on board--\r\nbiscuits, and even soft bread, though it was rather stale, and a box of\r\neggs, and bacon and cheese, and even some cooked meat, and there were\r\nalso melons, and oranges, and dried figs, and grapes, and other fruits,\r\nwhich showed that she had probably come from a warm country, where these\r\nfruits grew; indeed, they afterwards learned from some papers they\r\nfound, that she was the _Fair Ianthe_, and was from the Mediterranean,\r\nhomeward bound.  While Harry and David were examining one of the\r\nlockers, they felt something moving against their legs.  They looked\r\ndown, and saw a fine white cat, which by her movements, and the pleased\r\npurrs she gave when she saw that she was noticed, seemed to welcome\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"She must be a fairy, or the good genius of the ship,\" exclaimed David.\r\n\"Or, if she is a mere mortal cat, she must be very hungry, as I am sure\r\nI am, so let us go up and breakfast on deck, and try and get the old man\r\nto eat something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, I think that he would do much better down below, if we\r\ncould take off his wet things, and put him to bed,\" observed Harry.\r\n\r\nTo this David agreed, and, after they had eaten a little bread, for they\r\nwould not give themselves time to take more, they contrived, with\r\nconsiderable exertion, to lower old Jefferies into the cabin, and to put\r\nhim into bed.  This done, they lighted a fire in the cabin stove, and\r\nmade tea and boiled some eggs, and did some rashers.  They wisely, also,\r\ntook off their own wet things, which they hung up to dry, while they put\r\non some clothes which they found in the cabin.  What a hearty breakfast\r\nthey made!--and if it had not been for the thoughts of the poor lad who\r\nhad gone overboard, and the anxiety of their friends, they would have\r\npronounced themselves very jolly.  As it was, it cannot be said that\r\nthey were very unhappy.  At last they contrived to get old Jefferies to\r\nswallow some tea, and a little substantial food, for which he seemed\r\nmuch the better, and in a few minutes they had the satisfaction of\r\nseeing him drop off into a sound sleep.\r\n\r\nHarry and David returned to their meal, for they still felt somewhat\r\nhungry.  They soon began to nod, and at last David's head dropped on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be off too, if I don't jump on deck and look after the boat,\r\nand see how the weather is,\" said Harry.  He found the boat secure, but\r\nthe weather very dull and far from promising, though there was then but\r\nlittle wind.  He scanned the horizon.  Not a sail was in sight, and\r\nunless with a stronger breeze than then blew, none could approach for\r\nsome time to come.  On examining the vessel he thought that there was no\r\ndanger of her sinking; indeed, except that she had lost her mast, he\r\ncould not make out why she had been deserted.  He judged by the way she\r\nrolled that she was slightly leaking, and had made some water.  \"We'll\r\npump her out by and by, and she will be all right till we get a fair\r\nbreeze to return home,\" he thought to himself.  \"Perhaps we may carry\r\nher in, and obtain salvage.  That would be very fine, better than all\r\nthe prize-money I am likely to make for a long time to come.\"  Such were\r\nthe ideas that floated through his mind as he returned to the cabin.  A\r\ncomfortable-looking bed invited him to rest, and rousing up David for a\r\nmoment, he made him crawl half asleep into another.  Both of them in\r\nhalf a second were soundly sleeping, and had the tempest again arisen,\r\nthey would not probably have awakened then.\r\n\r\nVery different would have been the case had Harry been a captain, but\r\nthe cares and responsibilities of midshipmen are light, and their\r\nslumbers sound.  Hours passed by, when they both started up, hearing a\r\nvoice crying out, \"Where am I?  What has happened?  Ah me! ah me!\"  It\r\nwas old Jefferies who spoke.  They went to him.  He had returned to\r\nconsciousness, and now remembered the loss of his grandson.  They did\r\ntheir best to comfort the old man.  They felt that they had been\r\nremotely the cause of the lad's death.  \"No fault of yours, young\r\ngentlemen,\" he answered to a remark one of them had made; \"it was God's\r\nwill to call the boy home.  We must never murmur at what God chooses to\r\ndo.  He knows what's best for us.  Ah, if you had heard Mr Wesley\r\npreach, as I often have, you'd understand these things better than you\r\ndo, perhaps.\"  They were glad to let him talk on, as the doing so seemed\r\nto divert his mind from his grief.  He told them much about the great\r\npreacher, and among other things that he was never stopped by weather\r\nfrom keeping an appointment, and that though wet through, with his high\r\nboots full of water, he would deliver his message of love to an\r\nassembled congregation before he would change his garments.\r\n\r\nWhile they were all asleep the fire had gone out.  They relighted it,\r\nand cooked an abundance of their fish, and spread their table with it,\r\nand several other things they had discovered.  They little knew how the\r\ntime had gone by, and were therefore greatly surprised to find darkness\r\nagain coming on.  The two lads hurried on deck, followed by old\r\nJefferies.  The sky was still obscured.  No land was in sight, and only\r\ntwo or three sails could be observed in the far distance.  They watched\r\nthem, but they were steering away from the ship.  It was evidently too\r\nlate, even if old Jefferies had been strong enough, to leave her that\r\nday.  They therefore made up their minds to pass another night on board,\r\nand to leave early the next day.\r\n\r\n\"If the sky is clear we may do so,\" observed Harry.  \"But I have hunted\r\neverywhere, and can find no compass; so that unless we can see the\r\nstars, we shall be unable to steer a right course.  If we venture to\r\nmake the attempt, we may perhaps find ourselves far away in the\r\nAtlantic, and never be able to return.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nA STORM--THE BOAT LOST--A DISCOVERY--HARRY SAVES DAVID'S LIFE--PUMPING--\r\nTHE STRANGE SAIL.\r\n\r\nAnother night began on board the wreck.  The boys, however, saw nothing\r\nunpleasant in the prospect.  They had plenty of food and firing, their\r\nclothes were dry, old Jefferies appeared to be recovering, and they\r\nhoped he would be able to assist them in navigating the boat homeward.\r\nThey agreed that they would be up by daylight, and fit the boat with a\r\nmast and sails and oars, besides loading her with as many provisions as\r\nshe could carry.  They felt rather chilly, so they made up a fire, and\r\nsat chatting over it quite comfortably, till they almost forgot they\r\nwere out on the ocean, no land in sight, in a dismasted vessel, and all\r\nby themselves.  Harry again broached the idea of carrying in the ship\r\nherself, but David doubted whether they could manage to do so.  Harry\r\nthen explained that they might form ury-masts out of a number of spars\r\nlashed together, and that sails might be hoisted on these, fixed in\r\ndifferent parts of the deck.\r\n\r\n\"The rudder is in good order, so that we may just as easily find our way\r\nto the land, and into port, I hope, in the ship, as in the boat; while\r\nwe shall be far more comfortable, and not much longer about it, I should\r\nthink,\" he remarked.  \"I only fear lest an enemy's cruiser should see\r\nus, and either take possession of the brig, or burn her, and carry us\r\noff prisoners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much chance of that, I should hope,\" answered David.  \"We should\r\nnot prove a prize of much value, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed! they would think it no small thing to capture a British\r\nnaval officer,\" remarked the young mid, drawing himself up to his full\r\nheight, which was not very great; \"and I vote we do not give in without\r\na fight for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I only saw two guns on deck, and I do not think that we should be\r\nable to work them, even if we can find powder and shot,\" said David.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there is a store of both on board, depend on it, and if we put on a\r\nbold face, we may drive off an enemy, provided he is not a very big\r\none,\" answered the midshipman.\r\n\r\nSome time was occupied in these discussions.  They then went on deck and\r\nlooked about them.  Though a long slow swell swept as it were\r\noccasionally across the ocean, the surface was otherwise perfectly\r\nsmooth; indeed, there was not a breath of air to disturb it, but a thick\r\nmist hung over the sea, which prevented any objects from being seen even\r\nat a short distance off.  This was as likely to prove advantageous to\r\nthem as the contrary; and so, having taken a short walk on dock, they\r\nwent below, said their prayers, found that the old man was asleep,\r\nturned in and followed his example.  Harry knew perfectly well that,\r\naccording to strict discipline, a watch ought to have been kept, but he\r\nand David agreed that, as there was a calm, they could not be run down,\r\nand that the wreck was not likely to drift far from where they then\r\nwere, while it was clearly far pleasanter to be asleep than walking the\r\ndeck.  Hitherto they had not had time to examine the hold or the fore\r\npart of the vessel.  This, however, they purposed doing in the morning.\r\nHappy time of youth!  They slept very soundly and comfortably, looking\r\nforward with confidence to the future, and little dreaming what was to\r\nhappen.  When people have been deprived of their night's rest, they\r\nfrequently sleep a very long time on a stretch.  Harry was awaked by\r\nDavid, who exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"Dear me! the ship is tumbling about fearfully; the gale must have\r\nsprung up again.\"\r\n\r\nHe then heard old Jefferies say, in a weak voice, \"What, lads, are you\r\nthere?  I was afraid that you had deserted the old man.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, we would not do that,\" answered David.  \"But I am afraid that\r\nthe ship must be shaken to pieces if this continues.\"\r\n\r\n\"If she has floated through one gale she may float through another.  We\r\nmust trust in God,\" said the old man.  \"Ah me!  I am very feeble.  If we\r\ncouldn't put our faith in Him, we should be badly off indeed.  I cannot\r\nhelp myself, much less you.\"\r\n\r\nHarry was by this time fully awake, and called David to follow him on\r\ndeck, to ascertain what was the matter.  When David got there, he wished\r\nhimself below again.  The gale had returned with tenfold fury, and the\r\nhelpless ship was driving before it, surrounded by high foaming and\r\nroaring seas; the mist had cleared away, but the clouds were as thick as\r\never, chasing each other across the sky.  Nothing else was to be seen.\r\nMountain waves and dark clouds almost pressing down on their heads--no\r\nsail in sight to bring them assistance.  So violently was the ship\r\ntossed about, that they could scarcely keep their feet, even by holding\r\non.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the boat! the boat!\" shouted David.  Just before, they had seen her\r\nstill afloat, secured by the hawser, when a heavy sea, rolling towards\r\nthe ship, broke aboard the boat, and filled her in an instant.  She rose\r\non the top of a high foaming sea, when the thwart to which the two ropes\r\nwere secured was torn out of her, and the next moment she sunk from\r\nsight.  The boys looked at each other for a minute or more without\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to stick to the ship now, at all events,\" said Harry at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\"I hope that the ship will stick to us, and keep afloat, then,\" remarked\r\nDavid.\r\n\r\n\"We'll sound the well presently, and see what water she has in her,\"\r\nsaid Harry.  \"In the meantime, let us go down into the hold, and see of\r\nwhat her cargo consists.  Much depends on that, whether or not she keeps\r\nafloat.  I want to have a look into the fore peak also; I cannot make\r\nout why the vessel should have been deserted.\"\r\n\r\nThe main hatch was on, and as it would have been dangerous to lift it,\r\neven if they could have done so, when any moment the deck might have\r\nbeen swept by a sea, they worked their way on to the fore hatch.  This\r\nwas not secured.  They descended.  It was some time before they could\r\nsee about them in the close, dark, and dirty abode of the seamen.  On\r\neither side were bed-places, one above another, with a few large wooden\r\nchests below them, and jackets and trousers, and various other articles,\r\nhanging up against the bulkhead.  They observed nothing of consequence,\r\nand as the atmosphere was stirring, they were about to climb up again on\r\ndeck, when a low groan was heard.  Both were brave fellows, but it must\r\nbe confessed that their hearts sunk, and their first impulse was to\r\nhurry up the ladder as fast as they could go.  Again there was a groan.\r\nThey looked at each other.  Was it a human voice?  There could be little\r\ndoubt about that.  Where could it come from?  They stopped for a few\r\nseconds, holding on to the ladder, to recover their composure.  The\r\nvoice came from one of the berths; of that they were soon satisfied.\r\nJust then Harry observed a small locker close to the ladder, and putting\r\nin his hand found a candle and tinder-box.  A light was soon struck; and\r\nthey approached the berth whence the groans had proceeded.  It is not\r\nsurprising that they should have started back with horror.  The dim\r\nlight of the candle fell on the ghastly features of a human being, who,\r\nexcept that his eyes moved wildly, might have been taken for a corpse.\r\nHis beard was long and tangled, and blood, which had flowed from a\r\nfearful gash across his brow, stained the blankets in which he was\r\nwrapped.  His eyes were staring wildly, his mouth was open.  He seemed\r\nat the point of death.  Yet he was not dying of starvation, for within\r\nhis reach hung a bottle of water and a bag of biscuits.  Why, however,\r\nhe had been deserted was a mystery which he himself seemed incapable of\r\nsolving.  In vain Harry and David asked him.  Not a word did he speak in\r\nanswer to their questions.  He was, however, conscious of their\r\npresence, they thought, by the way his eyes followed them as they moved\r\nabout the cabin.  Had they discovered him before, they might have been\r\nof some assistance to him, but they could not now even attempt to move\r\nhim into another berth.  David, however, undertook to get some better\r\nfood from the cabin.  Harry did not feel altogether comfortable when\r\nleft alone with the dying man.  He looked so horrible, and the groans\r\nwhich he uttered were so fearful.  David seemed to be absent a long\r\ntime.  He did not like to leave the wretched man, or he would have gone\r\nto look for him.  What could have become of David?  The sea every now\r\nand then washed with a loud sound across the deck.  Could he have been\r\ncarried away by it?  How dreadful the thought!  He went back to the\r\ndying man, and stood over him, hoping that he might return, to\r\nconsciousness.  Suddenly the man sat up, and pointing with his thin hand\r\nacross the cabin, uttered a loud shriek, and sinking back was a corpse.\r\nThe young midshipman was left alone in the dark fore peak of the sinking\r\nvessel.  The sad thought came across him that perhaps he might be the\r\nonly living person on board.  Old Jefferies was apparently on the point\r\nof death, and perhaps David had been washed overboard.  As he could be\r\nof no use where he was, he determined to ascertain the worst, and\r\nclimbed up on deck, immediately closing the hatch again.  He looked\r\nabout him.  David was not to be seen.  Even during the time he had been\r\nbelow matters had grown worse--the ship was tumbling about more than\r\never, and the seas, which rose high above the bulwarks, seemed every\r\ninstant about to engulf her.  But where was David?  He worked his way,\r\nnot without great danger of being carried overboard, to the companion\r\nhatch, over which, stooping down, he shouted David's name.  His heart\r\nsank within him.  There was no answer.  \"David!  David!\" he cried again.\r\n\"Oh, David, where are you?\"  Was his dear brave friend really gone?\r\nJust then he observed that some rigging had been washed over the\r\nstarboard quarter, and he fancied that he heard a faint cry.  From the\r\ntemporary position of the wreck, the sea ceased just then to break\r\naboard.  Harry sprang aft, and there, clinging desperately to the\r\nrigging, now almost under water, now lifted into the air, as the stern\r\nof the ship was thrown upwards, he saw David.  His friend recognised\r\nhim, but seemed unable to speak.  Though Harry could not swim he could\r\nclimb well, and was strong and active.  His immediate impulse was to\r\nfasten a rope round his own waist, the other end secured round a\r\nstanchion, and to spring towards David.  \"We will die together,\" he said\r\nto himself as he did so, \"or I will save him.  May we be protected!\"  He\r\nalighted on a spar close to David, whose arm he saw was caught by a\r\nrope, from which he could not disengage himself.  To do this without the\r\nrisk of his friend being washed away was no easy task.  He succeeded at\r\nlength, however, in doing so, and by an effort, of which he would not\r\nhave thought himself capable, he scrambled up on deck again by means of\r\nthe tangled mass of ropes, and tattered sails and spars, which hung\r\noverboard.  Then, dreading that another sea would come and sweep them\r\nback together into the seething ocean, they tottered to the companion\r\nhatchway, down which Harry half dragged, half carried his friend,\r\nclosing the hatch above him.  Scarcely had he done so than a tremendous\r\nblow on the hatch, and the loud rushing sound of the water as it passed\r\nover the deck, told them that another sea had broken aboard, which would\r\nin all probability have swept them away to destruction.  They fell on\r\ntheir knees in thankfulness as they reached the cabin, that they had\r\nbeen thus providentially preserved.  They then went to the berth in\r\nwhich old Jefferies lay.  He was still too weak to move, but perfectly\r\nsensible.  They told him what had just occurred, and of the death of the\r\npoor seaman whom they had discovered in the fore peak.  He could not\r\nconjecture why the man had been left there.  The boys, however, thought\r\nthat, by examining all the papers, they might elucidate the mystery.\r\nThey feared, from the appearance of the poor stranger, that some foul\r\ndeed had been done on board.  Now, however, they were more concerned\r\nabout themselves.  The brig had hitherto withstood all the buffeting she\r\nhad received without apparently leaking much, but would she continue to\r\ndo so?  Old Jefferies thought not.  He had heard, he said, strange\r\nsounds as he lay in bed, which he knew well proceeded from water forcing\r\nits way into the hold, or rather from the air which was thereby forced\r\nout--groans, and sighs, and low cries.\r\n\r\n\"Some people, when they hear these sounds for the first time, think that\r\nthe ship is full of ghosts and spirits, and that they are crying out\r\nthat she is going down,\" observed the old man.  \"But I know better.  I\r\nwish that I hadn't heard them, for they make me sad.  Not for myself,\r\nthough, for I am well-nigh worn out, and that poor boy's death weighs\r\nheavy on me.  I daren't face his grandmother, and tell her that he is\r\ngone.  But, boys, I am sorry for you.  You are young and full of life,\r\nand there are many who love you on shore, and will mourn your loss.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, do you think that the ship is going down?\" exclaimed Harry and\r\nDavid together, in a very natural tone of dismay.\r\n\r\n\"It would be cruel in me not to tell you so, and I hope that you are\r\nprepared to die, my boys,\" answered the old man.  \"Still I don't say but\r\nthat in God's mercy you may escape.  A vessel may heave in sight in time\r\nto take you off, or you may build a raft, and it may float you till you\r\nare picked up.  I don't say give in, but be prepared for the worst.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys listened calmly to what the old man said.\r\n\r\n\"We will hope for the best, rig the pumps, and try and keep her free,\"\r\nanswered Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Not much hope of that, I fear,\" said the old man.  \"We can but try,\"\r\nexclaimed David.  \"Let us go on deck at once, and see what we can do.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be washed overboard if you go now on deck,\" said old Jefferies.\r\n\"You must wait till the sea goes down again somewhat, and you may then\r\npump away with a will.\"\r\n\r\nThe latter part of this advice the boys agreed, after waiting some time,\r\nto disregard.  If the ship was sinking, the sooner the water could be\r\npumped out of her the better.  They fancied, also, that she rolled less\r\nthan before.  In spite of the old man's warnings, they once more,\r\ntherefore, found their way on deck.  The state of the wreck seemed\r\nalmost hopeless, but, like brave boys as they were, they still kept to\r\ntheir resolution of trying to pump out the water.  They fortunately\r\nfound the brake of the pump, as the handle is called, and shipping it,\r\nbegan to work away with might and main.  The water quickly came up in a\r\nclear, bright stream, which told too plainly, without their sounding the\r\nwell, the large amount of water which had either leaked in or found its\r\nway below.  They had left their coats and shoes in the cabin, everything\r\nthat would encumber them, in case they should be washed from their hold.\r\nThe waves rose up around them, the spray in dense showers dashing every\r\ninstant over their heads, and almost blinding them when it struck them\r\nin the face.  Still undaunted they stood at their post.\r\n\r\n\"This must tell,\" exclaimed David, as he watched the full stream flowing\r\nfrom the pump.  \"If we get the ship clear, all may yet be well.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be coming in faster than we are pumping it out,\" said Harry.\r\n\"Still it may keep us afloat till help comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that there is not much prospect of that,\" said David.\r\n\"Though, to be sure, we cannot be so very far from land, or those\r\nscreeching seagulls would not be hovering about us.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have powerful wings, and can fly a long way from land,\" observed\r\nHarry.  \"Those come probably from the west coast of Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nThese remarks were made at intervals and by jerks, as it were, while\r\nthey stopped pumping for an instant to change their position.  They were\r\nencouraged to persevere, first, by believing that their efforts were\r\nproducing some effect on the amount of water in the ship, and then, by\r\nobserving that the sea was again going down.  During one of these\r\nintervals, when the wreck had been thrown higher up than usual, Harry\r\nexclaimed, \"A sail! a sail! she is standing this way.\"\r\n\r\nThe glimpse was momentary, and before David could catch sight of the\r\nstranger the ship had again sunk into the trough of the sea.  In vain\r\nDavid looked out for the ship.  Still Harry asserted that he was not\r\nmistaken.  After pumping for some time they were compelled to knock off\r\nfrom fatigue.  For fear of being washed away they lashed themselves to\r\nthe stump of the nearest mast, and thus secured they lay down on the wet\r\ndeck to rest.  Again they rose bravely to their work, but each tune they\r\nhad to stop pumping they rested for a longer period, and continued\r\npumping after it for a shorter period.\r\n\r\nDavid, at last, caught sight of the vessel Harry had seen, and was also\r\nof opinion that she was approaching them.  The hope of being saved,\r\nwhich had never died, now grew stronger and stronger.  Now, as the wreck\r\nwas lifted up the side of a sea, or the stranger mounted a foaming\r\nbillow, her whole hull was visible, and they saw she was a long, low\r\nblack schooner.  Even at that distance Harry did not like her\r\nappearance.  To satisfy himself he went to the companion hatch, inside\r\nof which a telescope was hung up.  With it both he and David took a more\r\nexact examination of the stranger, and came to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\n\"She is not an English craft, of that I am certain,\" observed Harry.\r\n\"She may be a privateer, but is more like those rascally pirates who\r\ninfest the West Indies and African coast, and used to be found down on\r\nthe Spanish main; she has a large crew, too, I see.  Now, I suspect, if\r\nwe were to get aboard her the fellows would make us join them or walk\r\nthe plank.  Still, it might be better to pretend to enter on board than\r\nto go down with this wreck.  What do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"If yonder craft is of the character you fancy, I say let us stick to\r\nthe wreck; but we will ask old Jefferies what he thinks about it--we\r\nwouldn't leave him on any account; at the same time, if he wishes to go,\r\nI should say that we ought to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you,\" answered Harry.  \"Let us pump away till she gets\r\nnearer, and then we will go and consult Jefferies.\"\r\n\r\nThe schooner approached, and a nearer view only confirmed the boys in\r\ntheir opinion of her character.  Why she came near the wreck it was\r\ndifficult to say.  Another look through the spy-glass showed them a\r\nnumber of men on board and several guns on her deck.\r\n\r\n\"I do not suppose they will trouble themselves about us unless we hail\r\nthem, and then, perhaps, they might endeavour to take us off the wreck,\r\nbut I am not quite certain about it,\" observed Harry.  They were\r\nstanding while speaking inside the companion hatch, with their heads\r\njust above it.\r\n\r\nThe schooner was coming up fast.  Suddenly the ports nearest them were\r\nopened, wreaths of smoke burst forth, and several shots whistled close\r\nabove their heads, one going through the bulwarks and ploughing up the\r\ndeck.  Their impulse was to jump below.  They could do nothing to help\r\nthemselves, but they hoped that the strangers would not continue to make\r\na target of them.\r\n\r\nJefferies had heard the shots, and wondered why they had been fired.\r\nWhen they told him their suspicions, he advised them to keep below.\r\n\r\n\"I have my thoughts on the subject,\" he remarked.  \"Hark! they are\r\nfiring again; there! another shot struck the ship.  If it was not for\r\nthe heavy sea running we should be worse off than we are.  It is no easy\r\nmatter to take aim from the deck of a craft tumbling about as the\r\nschooner must be.  If it was, depend upon it there would be a score or\r\nmore sent into the brig between wind and water.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should the schooner's people be so anxious to make a target of\r\nthe brig?\" asked David.\r\n\r\n\"To sink her,\" answered the old man.  \"They think, if fallen in with,\r\nshe might tell a tale they don't wish to have known.  That's my notion,\r\nbut I may be wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"There they go again at it!\" exclaimed Harry.  \"Two shots struck us.\r\nDon't you think, David, that we had better go on deck and show\r\nourselves?  They would scarcely try to sink the wreck if they found that\r\nthere were people on board, even though they might not take us off.\"\r\n\r\n\"The very reason that would make them still more anxious to send us to\r\nthe bottom.  You had better not show yourselves,\" said the old man; but\r\nthe lads did not hear him, for they were already on their way on deck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nMAKING A RAFT--AFLOAT ON IT--THE GRIEF AT HOME--CAPTAIN RYMER'S\r\nAPPOINTMENT--THE VOYAGE.\r\n\r\nThat raging sea, which it appeared at first would prove the destruction\r\nof those on board the brig, was in reality the means of their\r\npreservation.  Just as the boys got their heads above the companion\r\nhatch, another whole broadside was let fly, and though many of the shots\r\npassed over the ship, two or three struck her between wind and water.\r\nHad the sea been calmer, many more probably would have found their way\r\nthrough her sides, and she must instantly have gone to the bottom.  Such\r\nwas the fate the boys, not without good reason, now anticipated for her.\r\nAnother broadside would prove sufficient.\r\n\r\n\"Had we not better show ourselves, and ask to be taken on board?\" said\r\nDavid.\r\n\r\n\"What, boys, and be murdered!\" cried the old man from below.  \"Stick to\r\nthe ship, and don't trust those villains.  There's One who will take\r\ncare of you if you put faith in Him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Old Jefferies is right.  Let us die rather than go on board the\r\npirate,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\nOnce more they climbed up the companion ladder, from which they had\r\njumped down at the last broadside.  They watched the schooner.  She had\r\ntacked, as if about to run down close to them, and deliver another\r\nbroadside.  Seeing this, they were prepared to leap back into the cabin,\r\nwhen suddenly she hauled her tacks aboard, and stood directly away from\r\nthem.  Did her crew believe that the shots they had fired would speedily\r\neffect their supposed purpose, and take the brig to the bottom, or were\r\nthey only firing for practice?  As soon as the schooner had got a little\r\ndistance off, the boys jumped on deck and hurried to the pump.  Harry\r\nfirst sounded the well.  His face grew very serious.\r\n\r\n\"David,\" he said, \"the water has gained fearfully on us.  The shot-holes\r\nmust be letting in the water fast, and I do not think that the brig can\r\nfloat another hour--perhaps not ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are we to do, then?\" asked David.\r\n\r\n\"Build a raft,\" answered Harry.  \"There are plenty of spars.  I saw some\r\ncarpenter's tools and large nails in the cabin, and we may break off the\r\nhatches.  They will help us.  We must be sharp about it, though.\"\r\n\r\nOf this there could be no doubt.  That they might give the old fisherman\r\na better chance of saving his life, they agreed to get him up first.  By\r\ntaking an abundance of food and rest, he had greatly recovered his\r\nstrength, and was now able to do as they proposed.\r\n\r\n\"If I cannot work, I may give you my advice,\" he observed.  \"I have more\r\nthan once had to trust to a raft for my life.\"\r\n\r\nThe cat followed them on deck.  The old man shook his head when he saw\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"She knows that the cabin is no longer a safe place for her, and that\r\nshe will be better off up here,\" he said, as the boys placed him on a\r\nheavy coil of rope near the mainmast.  The ship was happily more quiet\r\nthan she had before been, and the boys, having collected all the spars\r\nand planks they could find, as well as some chairs and a table from the\r\ncabin, commenced, under old Jefferies' directions, to form the proposed\r\nraft.  They worked away with all their might, knowing well that a few\r\nminutes' delay would be fatal.  A large raft was not required, as it had\r\nto support only three persons and their provisions.  The great thing was\r\nto make it strong enough.  They brought up all the small rope they could\r\nfind and lashed the stoutest of the spars together, so as to form an\r\noblong framework, with a centre spar as a keel.  They further secured\r\nthem with large nails.  Then they placed planks and smaller spars across\r\nthis, with the table, top downwards, and the chairs on their backs,\r\nsecured to it.  They managed to wrench off two of the cabin doors, and\r\nthese, nailed down and lashed across the raft, raised the deck and\r\nincreased its strength.  Besides the chairs, there were some strong\r\nstools in the cabin.  These they nailed down at each corner, and secured\r\nthem also by lashings, with their legs up.  They then passed ropes round\r\nthe legs, thus forming a sort of bulwark that might save them from being\r\nwashed off the raft.  They had still much to do after this before the\r\nraft would be complete.  They wanted a couple of chests in which to keep\r\ntheir provisions, a cask for water, a mast and sails, and oars, and\r\nblankets to keep them warm at night.  They had been some time at work,\r\nand the water was already over the cabin floor.  Any attempt to save the\r\nvessel was now hopeless.  Harry, happening to look up, saw what, had he\r\nbeen on the watch, he would have observed long before, a large ship,\r\nunder a press of sail, at no great distance.  Was the wreck seen by\r\nthose on board?  If so, their prospect of escape was greatly improved.\r\nThey hoped that they were seen, for although they were thankful that\r\nthey had had time to form a raft, they knew well that at best it was a\r\nperilous means of support, that it might be upset or dashed to pieces,\r\nor that they might float about on it unseen till all their provisions\r\nand water were exhausted, and then die of starvation and thirst.  They\r\nearnestly hoped, therefore, that they might be seen from the passing\r\nship.  They had reserved a short spar as a mast for the raft.  To this\r\nthey fastened a flag, and secured it to the mainmast.  So occupied were\r\nthey, indeed, in watching the stranger, that for a few minutes they\r\nforgot to go on with their raft, till recalled by old Jefferies to\r\ncontinue the important work.  They had now to search for some chests.\r\nThey had seen several in the fore peak.  It was with a degree of awe,\r\nperhaps not altogether free from fear, that they again went to where the\r\ndead seaman lay.  They quickly cut two chests clear of the lashings\r\nwhich secured them, and were emptying them of their contents, when they\r\ncame upon a box or case, the size of an ordinary writing-case.  It was\r\nof foreign manufacture, and secured with strong brass bands.  When\r\ntaking it out with other things, Harry heard a sound like the chink of\r\nmoney within.  He shook it.  There was no doubt about the matter.\r\n\"We'll keep it.  It may be useful, and it is our lawful prize,\" he\r\nobserved, as he put it back into the chest.  Fastening ropes to the\r\nhandles of the chests, they were soon hauled on deck, and secured to the\r\nraft.  Now came the important work of provisioning their ark of safety.\r\nThey had already got on deck some biscuits, and salt beef and pork\r\nuncooked.  They again descended for more articles which they had seen,\r\nand which, together with some blankets, they brought up.  Once more they\r\nwent below, and even during the short time they had been on deck, they\r\nobserved that the water had considerably risen.  Still they were\r\npersevering in their search for more provisions, when old Jefferies'\r\nvoice summoned them hastily on deck.\r\n\r\n\"She is going down!--she is going down!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\nThey rushed up, and had just time to drag him on to the raft, and to\r\nseize the oars and spars they had got ready, when the vessel's bow rose,\r\nand her stern gradually sank, till she glided away towards the bottom,\r\nliterally from beneath their feet.  Just before this the cat, who seemed\r\ndetermined to stick to the vessel to the last, made a spring on to the\r\nraft, where she stood trembling with fear and astonishment at the\r\ndisappearance of her home.  As soon as the water reached the raft, by\r\nmeans of the poles they shoved off from the wreck, and then pulled away\r\nwith all their might, so as completely to clear her.  The raft rocked\r\nviolently, and, in spite of all their efforts, seemed dragged towards\r\nthe vortex formed by the sinking vessel.  In another instant the brig\r\nwas no longer to be seen, and her secret, whatever it was, was buried\r\nwith her.  They looked anxiously around.  The ship was standing in the\r\ndirection the schooner had gone.  They floated alone on that wild,\r\nstormy waste of waters.  The old man had been placed in the middle of\r\nthe raft, while the boys took their places on either side of him,\r\nendeavouring with the oars to keep the raft before the seas.  Among\r\nother things placed on it were some carpenter's tools, spars, blankets,\r\nand a good supply of rope.  They had thus the means of rigging a mast.\r\nThey did this by nailing boards between the two front legs of the table,\r\nand lashing the mast to the middle of the boards, while they carried\r\nstays forward and on either side.  The wind was so much warmer, that\r\nthey supposed it must have shifted to the west, though the thick clouds\r\nwhich still shrouded the sky prevented them from finding out the points\r\nof the compass.  By Jefferies' advice, they continued making the\r\narrangements which have been described, though they still hoped they\r\nmight be seen from the passing ship, which Harry declared to be the\r\nfrigate to which he belonged--the _Ariadne_.  At last, however, they had\r\nto abandon this hope, as the frigate continued her course, in chase,\r\napparently, of the mysterious schooner.  Unless seen by some other\r\nvessel, Harry and David felt that they must now, humanly speaking,\r\ndepend on their own exertions for reaching the shore.  Harry rigged a\r\nmast; they next fitted a sail, and with no small satisfaction hoisted\r\nit.  By fixing an oar so as to act as a rudder astern, the raft, as soon\r\nas the sail was hoisted, behaved remarkably well, and glided over the\r\nseas with considerable ease and rapidity.  Their spirits rose again, for\r\nthey fully believed that they should in two or three days reach either\r\nthe English or the Irish coast.  They had no idea how far to the\r\nwestward they had been driven.  By degrees the sea went down, which was\r\nvery pleasant, but so also did the wind, till it became a perfect calm.\r\nAn end was thus put to their hopes of soon reaching the land.  However,\r\nthey were far more comfortable than they had been for some time.  The\r\nafternoon sun shone out brightly, and dried their clothes; and they had\r\nplenty to eat--biscuits, and cooked meat, and cheese and butter, and\r\nfigs and raisins, and several other fruits, and some bottles of wine, of\r\nwhich they wisely partook very sparingly.  It, however, did the old man\r\nmuch good, and he appeared to have recovered both his strength and\r\nspirits.  Although well off in many respects, they had, however, a\r\nscarcity of one article, without which they could not hope to prolong\r\nexistence.  That was water.  They could only secure one small cask, and\r\nthey saw, therefore, that they must husband the precious liquid with the\r\ngreatest care.\r\n\r\nThey now floated tranquilly on the calm waters, and though they would\r\nfar rather have been sailing northward, they were thus enabled to\r\nstrengthen the raft, and to prepare for it encountering any more rough\r\nweather which might come on.  They had made old Jefferies as comfortable\r\nas they could in the centre of the raft, and they soon had the satis\r\nfaction of finding that he had fallen asleep.  Having accomplished all\r\nthat could be done, they began to chat away as composedly as if nothing\r\nvery particular had occurred.  They went on, indeed, almost with the\r\nconversation which had been interrupted when they discovered that the\r\nrock on which they were sitting was surrounded by water.  Strange to\r\nsay, Harry expressed no wish or intention of leaving the profession he\r\nhad embraced should they reach the shore, while David was as determined\r\nas ever to enter it should he be able to obtain his father's leave.  No\r\nwonder, when the long list of glorious victories won by the British navy\r\nwas fresh in the memory of the nation, and naval officers in all social\r\ncircles were looked upon and courted as heroes.  At length old Jefferies\r\nawoke.\r\n\r\n\"Now, boys, you must take your rest,\" he said.  \"You have watched for\r\nme, and now I'll watch for you.  It won't do for us all to nap together,\r\nand if I see any change I'll call you.  Never fear, puss and I will look\r\nafter the ship.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys did not require a second bidding, but stretching themselves\r\ninside the legs of the upturned table, were soon fast asleep.\r\n\r\nWe must now return for a short time to their friends on shore.  Poor\r\nMrs Merryweather was almost broken-hearted on being at length compelled\r\nto give up all hopes of ever again seeing her gallant son, and on being\r\nable to account in no other way for his and his friend's disappearance\r\nthan that they had fallen over a cliff, or been washed away by the sea.\r\nShe knew where to go for comfort and consolation; and her chief\r\nsatisfaction, when she heard that old Mrs Jefferies had lost her\r\nhusband and grandson on the same night, was to show her whence she could\r\nderive the same consolation she herself had found.  It was a sore trial\r\nto the poor old woman.  Mr and Mrs Morton also did their best to\r\ncomfort her; indeed, had it not been for them she would have been\r\ncompelled to resort to the workhouse for support.  They sympathised with\r\nthe old woman, not because they were aware of the service her husband\r\nhad rendered those dear to them, but because, as they supposed, a like\r\ncalamity had overtaken her and themselves at the same time.  Still Mr\r\nMorton did not cease for a long time to have search made for them, till\r\nat length he was with a sad heart compelled to give it up in despair.\r\nCaptain Rymer sympathised heartily with his neighbour's misfortune, and\r\npretty little Mary shed many a tear for the loss of her two friends.\r\nSeveral months passed by, and still no news came of the lost ones.  With\r\ngreat reluctance the two families at length went into mourning.  It was\r\na sad day, for it was an acknowledgment that hope was given up, and that\r\nthe two dear lads were no longer among the living.\r\n\r\nOne morning Captain Rymer and his family were seated at breakfast; Mrs\r\nRymer had just poured out a cup of tea, and Mary had handed it to him\r\nwith a slice of toast which she had carefully buttered, when the\r\npost-bag was brought into the room.  He opened it, and drew forth a long\r\nofficial-looking envelope.\r\n\r\n\"No other letter?\" asked his wife.\r\n\r\n\"No, not one; and this is probably of no great importance either,\" he\r\nanswered, placing it by his side, and beginning to eat the toast Mary\r\nhad just given him.  Captain Rymer had been actively engaged during the\r\nwhole of the late war in many dangerous and arduous services, and, like\r\nother officers, felt somewhat aggrieved that his services had not been\r\nfully recognised.  He had frequently applied for some civil appointment,\r\nbut his requests had not been attended to, and the only results were\r\npolite answers, couched in the same official language, stating that his\r\nmerits would be duly considered.  At last he made up his mind that he\r\nwas to be laid on the shelf, and that he should never get anything.\r\nHowever, when he had finished his toast, he opened the letter.\r\n\r\n\"This is indeed what I little expected,\" he exclaimed.  \"I am appointed\r\nas Lieutenant-Governor of Saint -- in the West Indies.  It is one of the\r\nmost healthy of the islands.  I have often been there; indeed, it is in\r\nconsequence of my knowledge of the inhabitants that I have been\r\nselected; and you will all be able to accompany me.\"\r\n\r\nThis information, as may be supposed, caused a great deal of excitement\r\nin the family.  As Captain Rymer was ordered to proceed at once, there\r\nwas no time to be lost in making the necessary preparations.  Their\r\nfriends called to congratulate, and at the same time to express their\r\nregret at losing them.  The Mortons, and poor Mrs Merryweather, would\r\ncertainly miss them more than anybody else.  Mary could not help looking\r\nforward with pleasure to the interesting places she would probably\r\nvisit, and the new style of life she would have to lead; though she was\r\nvery sorry to leave so many kind friends, and the attached servants, who\r\ncould not accompany them.  In those days outfits were not to be\r\nprocured, nor other arrangements made, so rapidly as at present, and\r\nCaptain Rymer found it impossible to be ready to sail in the ship\r\nappointed to carry him out.  He had, therefore, to take his passage in a\r\nWest India trader, to sail a few weeks later.  The _Betsy_ was a fine\r\nlarge ship, carrying guns, to enable her to defend herself against the\r\npirates and small privateers, often no better, which at that time\r\ninfested the Caribbean Sea, and especially on the Spanish main and round\r\nthe coast of Cuba.  The cabins of the _Betsy_, on board which many\r\nwealthy West India planters frequently came backwards and forwards, were\r\nfor their accommodation fitted up in a style of luxury seldom found on\r\nboard merchantmen in general.  The _Betsy_ put into Falmouth to take the\r\nfamily and their baggage on board.  She then had to remain till joined\r\nby several other West India ships.  Everything was then made ready for\r\nsailing, and a bright look-out was kept for another fleet, bound in the\r\nsame direction, coming down channel under convoy of two men-of-war.\r\nThey were at length descried, and the ships in Falmouth harbour\r\nimmediately got under weigh, and stood out to join them.  At that time,\r\nalthough most of the men-of-war carrying the flag of England's enemies\r\nhad been swept from the seas, a large number of their privateers still\r\nremained to annoy and often injure her commerce.  It was therefore not\r\nconsidered safe for merchantmen to sail without the protection of one or\r\nmore men-of-war.  Mary was delighted with the appearance of the cabins,\r\nso luxurious compared to what she had expected; and she was still more\r\npleased when, on going on deck, she observed a large fleet of stately\r\nships with which she was surrounded.  The water was calm, the sky clear,\r\nand the sun shone brightly on the pyramids of white canvas towering up\r\nfrom the black, shining, freshly painted hulls which floated on the blue\r\nocean in all directions.  On the outskirts were the still more stately\r\nmen-of-war, their bright-coloured signal flags continually moving up and\r\ndown, while they occasionally fired a gun either on one side or the\r\nother, in rather a difficult attempt to keep their somewhat refractory\r\ncharges on their proper course.  Mary, after watching the manoeuvres of\r\nthe men-of-war and the fleet of merchant vessels for some time,\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"Why, papa, they put me in mind of a herd of cattle driven through the\r\ncountry, the drovers running here and there, shouting loudly, and\r\nsending their sharp barking dogs now to one side, now to the other, to\r\nkeep them together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bad idea, Mary,\" answered Captain Rymer.  \"But should thick\r\nweather come on, or a heavy gale spring up, the work will be much more\r\ndifficult.  Sometimes a whole herd, as you would call them, is\r\nscattered, and lions or wolves occasionally pounce down on the weakest,\r\nand carry them off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope that will not be our fate, papa,\" said Mary, timidly.\r\n\r\n\"No fear of that, dearest.  I am sorry that I should have put such a\r\nnotion into your head,\" answered Captain Rymer.  \"The _Betsy_ is a\r\nwell-found ship, well manned and well armed, and Captain Bolton has the\r\ncharacter of being a first-rate seaman, so that we have every reason for\r\nexpecting to arrive in safety at our destination.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am not at all afraid,\" said Mary.  \"Besides, you know, papa, we\r\ncan pray to be protected; and what a comfort it is, and how brave it\r\nshould make us, to know that God hears our prayers, and will grant them\r\nwhenever He sees that to do so is best for us!\"\r\n\r\nWhat a support in daily life, what a consolation to the voyager over the\r\nstormy ocean, is a firm confidence in that glorious truth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nON THE RAFT--THE SHARK--THE SEA-FIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe raft still floated uninjured; the sea continued perfectly calm.\r\nHarry and David retained their health and spirits, hoping that they\r\nshould reach the land at last; and the old man appeared to be steadily\r\nrecovering.  The calm tried them in one respect more than when the wind\r\nblew, because after the raft had been strengthened they had nothing to\r\ndo.  They talked of the past and of the future, but even friends cannot\r\ntalk on all day, especially if they are hungry and thirsty, and are\r\nanxious about any matter.  At last David recollected that they had taken\r\nsome fishing lines and hooks out of the boat, and thrown them with other\r\narticles on the raft.  They were soon discovered, and the lads flattered\r\nthemselves that they had nothing more to do than to bait the hooks, if\r\nbait could be found, and to throw them overboard.  Old Jefferies smiled\r\nwhen he saw their preparations, and told them that, although certain\r\nfish were to be caught occasionally in the open sea, the greater number\r\nwere to be found along the coasts of the different countries of the\r\nworld.  \"To my mind God has so ordered it that all the fish which best\r\nserve for the food of man swim round and round the coasts of the\r\ncountries of the world, in shallow water, where they can be got at and\r\ncaught, or else they visit certain known spots, like the banks of\r\nNewfoundland, or the fishing grounds in the North Sea.  Now if they all\r\nlived in the deep seas, or kept wandering about to all parts just as\r\nfancy led them, fishermen would never know where to go and look for\r\nthem.  Instead of that, as I have said, as the seasons come round, God\r\nleads them to the same places and almost on the same day every year; and\r\nso the fisherman is prepared with his nets or lines to catch them.\r\nHowever, I don't mean to say that there are no fish out even in\r\nmid-ocean, and if we get our lines, perhaps we shall catch some.\"\r\n\r\nThe lines were fitted in different ways; one with a heavy lead that it\r\nmight sink towards the bottom, the other to throw to a distance, and\r\nthen to drag quickly back again.  The chief difficulty was with regard\r\nto the bait.  David, however, proposed using a piece of salt pork,\r\nthough old Jefferies thought that no fish would bite at it.\r\n\r\n\"I'll try, at all events,\" he answered; and baiting his hook he threw it\r\nskilfully to a considerable distance.  He tried over and over again till\r\nhis arm grew tired, while Henry let his line down to its entire end, but\r\nneither of them got a bite.\r\n\r\n\"Very little use, I am afraid,\" said Harry, drawing up his line.\r\n\r\n\"Let it hang out, at all events.  It can do no harm, and something may\r\ntake a fancy to it,\" observed David, again throwing his own line.\r\n\"Halloa!  I have got something--a big fellow, too--he'll pull me off the\r\nraft if I don't take care.  Lend a hand, Harry.\"\r\n\r\nHarry took hold of the line.  Now they were able to haul in some of the\r\nline, and then again the fish swam off in an opposite direction,\r\nactually moving the raft.\r\n\r\n\"It may be a porpoise,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it is a shark!\" exclaimed David.  \"It can't be a young whale.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a big fish of some sort, of that there is no doubt,\" responded\r\nHarry.  \"The fellow will get tired before long, and then we will make\r\nhim show his nose.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he does not cut through the line before that,\" observed old\r\nJefferies, who would not pronounce as to what fish it was.\r\n\r\n\"If the line does not break I have little fear of its being cut through,\r\nfor there is a long shank to the hook, and the line has never been\r\nslack,\" answered David, hauling in more of the line.\r\n\r\nThe fish, if such it was, at length began to grow weary of towing the\r\nraft, and allowed himself to be drawn nearer and nearer till his mouth\r\nwas seen for an instant close to the surface.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!  I know him,\" exclaimed old Jefferies.  \"A shark! a shark! he's as\r\nmischievous a fellow as any that swims, though he will hurt no one who\r\ndoes not put his hand down his mouth.\"\r\n\r\nHe explained that the fish they had hooked was the _blue shark_, which,\r\nalthough he does not attempt to take the fisherman's life, is yet one of\r\nhis greatest foes.  If he cannot bite through a line he often rolls it\r\nround and round himself in a way that is most difficult for the\r\nfisherman to undo; and sometimes he will swim among the nets, killing\r\nthe fish in mere wantonness apparently, and biting the meshes.  Now and\r\nthen, however, he gets caught himself--a small satisfaction considering\r\nthe damage he causes.\r\n\r\nIt took some time before his sharkship was wearied out, and when at\r\nlength he was hauled up on the raft, it was found that he had contrived\r\nto wind several fathoms of the line round his body.  From the line\r\nhaving been kept tight, it was not so cleverly twisted as is often the\r\ncase, and a blow on the tail quieted him before he had managed further\r\nto wriggle it round himself after he was out of the water.  When the\r\nline was unwound, and the shark stretched out, he was a handsome-looking\r\nfish of a blue lead colour, about four feet long.  Harry and David did\r\nnot feel disposed to eat any of the shark, but when assured by the old\r\nfisherman that neither he nor any of his ancestors had ever touched\r\nflesh, they got over their reluctance, and as their appetites told them\r\nit was dinner-time, they each took a thin slice with some biscuit.  They\r\nagreed that when cooked it would be tolerable food.\r\n\r\nAfter this meal David, having got his line in order, and both their\r\nlines being baited with shark, they commenced fishing.  After some time\r\nHarry got a bite.\r\n\r\n\"A fine fish, I am sure, by the way he tugged,\" he exclaimed, hauling up\r\nthe line.\r\n\r\nIt came up very easily, though, and instead of the large fish he\r\nexpected, a small whiting appeared.  Several others were pulled up in\r\nsuccession.  As Harry was hauling in his line after a bite, he felt a\r\nheavy weight suddenly come on it.  Still he was able to get it in.\r\n\r\n\"It is something curious, but what it can be I am sure I don't know,\" he\r\nexclaimed, hauling away, while David looked eagerly on.\r\n\r\n\"What a monster!\" they cried out both together, when a huge mass, with\r\nwhat looked like a number of snakes wriggling about round it, was seen\r\non the surface amidst a circle of dark water.\r\n\r\n\"That's a squid,\" remarked old Jefferies.  \"Some of them are awkward\r\ncustomers in the water, but he can do you very little harm out of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth of this last assertion was put to the test when, in spite of\r\nits struggles, the creature was hauled up on the raft, and its long arms\r\nchopped off.  It had expected simply to catch a whiting, and had itself\r\nbeen caught by the hook sticking through the whiting's mouth.  It was\r\nvery untempting-looking for food, though they might have preferred it to\r\nshark flesh.  The whiting, however, supplied them with as much fish as\r\nthey could eat raw.  Altogether they agreed that they had had a good\r\nevening's sport, and that if they could have forgotten where they were,\r\nand that their friends were anxious about them, they should have enjoyed\r\nthemselves amazingly, only that they should have preferred cooked fish\r\nto raw.  As night, however, crept on, they began to feel the loneliness\r\nand helplessness of their position.  Still, the calm continued, and the\r\nstars shone forth, each spark of light being reflected in the\r\nmirror-like ocean; and Harry made out the polar star, and wished that\r\nthere was a good breeze that they might steer by it towards England.\r\nThe air was very chilly, but as they had saved several blankets, they\r\nwrapped themselves up, and kept tolerably warm.  As they had not got a\r\nlantern or candle, or any means of striking a light, they could do\r\nnothing, and so they chatted away till they both went off to the land of\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\n\"Sleep on, my poor lads,\" said the old man, guessing by their silence\r\nwhat had happened.  \"You little think of the danger you are in.  If a\r\ngale springs up, how is this small raft to weather it?  For myself, I am\r\nworn out, and my time must come in a year or two, or a few months it may\r\nbe; but life is fresh and pleasant for the young lads.  Well, well, God\r\nis kind and just.  He knows what is best for them.  His will be done.\"\r\n\r\nThe lives of most men are metaphorically varied by storms and calms,\r\nclouds and sunshine, and so in reality was the existence of our two\r\nyoung friends on the raft.  The night passed away quietly, and towards\r\nmorning the old man, in spite of his intentions to keep watch, fell\r\nasleep.  David was the first to rouse up.  The sun had not risen, but a\r\nstreak of red in the sky showed in what quarter he was about to appear.\r\nDavid stood up to look around him.  He would not call Harry till it was\r\nnecessary, for he was sleeping so calmly, with a smile on his\r\ncountenance, dreaming of some pleasant scenes at home, probably with his\r\nmother and sister present.  As David was thus standing up, holding on to\r\nthe mast, he felt a light air fan his cheek.  It came from the south.\r\nHe turned his eyes in that direction to look for a further sign of the\r\nwished-for breeze.  As he did so he observed in the horizon a sail--he\r\njudged a large ship.  Directly afterwards another appeared, in a\r\ndifferent part of the horizon.  He watched them attentively for some\r\ntime.  Their sails were filled with wind, and they seemed to be drawing\r\nnearer to each other, and also nearer to the raft.  As soon as it struck\r\nDavid that this was the case, he could no longer resist the temptation\r\nof rousing up his companion.  Harry sprang to his feet.  Midshipmen do\r\nnot rub their eyes and yawn, and groan and growl, before they get up,\r\nespecially if they happen to be sleeping on a raft in the chops of the\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they are standing this way,\" he exclaimed.  \"They are frigates,\r\nand what is more, though one is English, I doubt by the cut of the sails\r\nwhether the other is.\"\r\n\r\n\"At all events we shall have a good chance of being picked up,\" said\r\nDavid.\r\n\r\n\"I hope so; but if an idea which has struck me is correct, they will\r\nhave too much to do to look after each other to take any notice of us,\"\r\nobserved the midshipman.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked David.\r\n\r\n\"That one is English and the other French, and if so, it is not likely\r\nthat, having come in sight of each other, they will part without\r\nexchanging shots,\" remarked Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Unless the Frenchman runs away,\" said David.\r\n\r\n\"No fear of that.  The monsieurs are brave fellows, though we can lick\r\nthem, and it is not often they show the white feather,\" remarked Harry.\r\n\"I really think that I am right.  They look to me like two frigates, and\r\none I am sure is French.  We'll rouse up the old man, and hear what he\r\nhas to say about the matter.  He'll not thank us for letting him sleep\r\non.\"\r\n\r\n\"The old man is awake,\" said Jefferies, sitting up and gazing in the\r\ndirection indicated by the boys, under his open hand.  For some time he\r\nwas silent.  \"Yes, there's little doubt about the matter,\" he said at\r\nlength.  \"They are frigates, and one is English; the other is a\r\nforeigner, but whether Spaniard, Dutchman, or French, is more than I can\r\nsay.  If they are going to fight, as you think, we can't help it,\r\nneither can we make them sail near enough to see us, and pick us up; but\r\nI'll tell you what we can do, young gentlemen, we can lift up our voices\r\nin prayer to God to thank Him for His favours, and to ask Him for His\r\nprotection.\"\r\n\r\nAll three knelt down, and lifted up their voices to God in prayer, with\r\na heartiness which might be sought for in vain within the lofty walls of\r\nmany a proud building.  Such is the spiritual worship in which God the\r\nSpirit alone has pleasure.  The party on that wave-tossed raft rose from\r\ntheir knees greatly refreshed in spirit, and sat down to enjoy their\r\nmorning meal with hearts grateful that they had food sufficient to\r\nsustain life.  Soon after, the sun rose, as it were with a spring out of\r\nhis ocean bed, and shed his light across the expanse of waters on the\r\nsails of the approaching ships, which seemed to have drawn suddenly\r\nnear, so clear and defined did their forms become.  Harry watched with\r\neven greater eagerness than before one of the ships, which he declared\r\nwas, he believed, that to which he belonged.  David was rather inclined\r\nto laugh at the notion, as he considered that it was impossible Harry\r\nshould be able to know his own ship at so great a distance off.  There\r\nseemed to be no doubt that both were frigates--of that the old man\r\nexpressed himself sure; that they were not both English he thought very\r\nlikely.  As to the other point, it was, if correct, a guess of Harry's.\r\nThey continued to draw nearer and nearer to each other, and as they\r\napproached the raft at the same time, the breeze which filled their\r\nsails reached her.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we hoist our sails, and stand for the shore as before?\" asked\r\nDavid.\r\n\r\n\"We should miss the chance of being picked up if we did so,\" answered\r\nHarry.  \"Besides, I should not like to run away without knowing after\r\nall whether the ships would fight, and who was the conqueror.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much chance of our getting out of sight before they begin, for they\r\nare already not far off gun-shot of each other,\" observed the old man,\r\nwho again raised himself to look out, but sunk down once more to his\r\nseat in the centre of the raft.\r\n\r\nThe two boys, however, stood up, holding on by the mast, in spite of the\r\nincreasing rocking of the raft, watching eagerly the movements of the\r\ntwo frigates--for frigates there was no doubt they both were.\r\n\r\n\"Up go the colours!\" exclaimed Harry, with a shout.  \"Hurrah!  There's\r\nthe glorious old flag of England, and the other is French--there's no\r\ndoubt about it.  Then there'll be a fight.  Hurrah!  I wish I was aboard\r\nthe old ship; I'm sure it's her.  Couldn't we manage it even now?  Pull\r\nthe raft up to her.  I wish that she would see us and pick us up.  Oh\r\ndear! how provoking!  I'd give anything to be on board!\"  Such were the\r\nexclamations to which the young midshipman gave utterance, as he stood\r\nwatching the ships.  \"The old ship has tacked, she is standing away from\r\nus!  The Frenchman is about also.  They'll be away.  We shall not see\r\nany of the fighting after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall be less likely to suffer from their shots, and for that we may\r\nbe grateful,\" observed the old man.\r\n\r\nThe midshipman, so eager was he, scarcely listened to what was said.\r\nThe frigates were manoeuvring, each endeavouring to gain the\r\nweather-gauge before commencing the action, which it was very evident\r\nwould take place.  There appeared to be no lack of a disposition to\r\nfight on either side, for they both took in their lighter sails, and\r\nfinally hauled up their courses.  Now the English frigate wore round,\r\nher example being followed by the Frenchman, both running back towards\r\nthe raft, which it seemed that the former would pass by, or even run\r\nover, when suddenly she tacked, and standing close to a wind towards the\r\nFrench frigate, fired a broadside into her quarter, while the latter was\r\nin stays.  The effect of the broadside must have been severe, for it was\r\nsome time before she actually got about, leaving to the English frigate\r\nthe advantage of the weather-gauge, which had been the object of all the\r\nprevious manoeuvres.  For some time the two ships ran on alongside of\r\neach other, rapidly exchanging shots, without any great apparent damage\r\nto the masts or rigging.  They were so placed that many of the shots\r\nwhich missed came flying towards the raft, but providentially she was\r\ntoo far off for them to reach her.  Once more the after-yards of the\r\nFrench ship being shot away, she kept off the wind, and, followed by her\r\nantagonist, stood towards the raft, still keeping up a hot fire at her.\r\nIn a short time the damage was repaired, and once more the French ship\r\nhauling her wind, the two stood on together close-hauled.  It was\r\nevident, from the rapid way in which the French frigate's damages had\r\nbeen repaired, that she was well manned, and that the result was by no\r\nmeans so certain as Harry had at first anticipated.  The firing had had\r\nthe effect, it appeared, of lessening the little wind there had\r\npreviously been.  The two frigates, therefore, moved but slowly, and\r\nconsequently kept within sight of those on the raft.  Harry was almost\r\ntoo eager to speak.  David now and then made a few remarks.  More than\r\nan hour had passed away since the commencement of the action, and as yet\r\nthere was no visible advantage gained by either party.  Suddenly Harry\r\ngave a cry of anger and annoyance, in which David joined him.  The old\r\nman looked up.  There was cause for it.  The flag of England was seen to\r\ndrop from the masthead of the frigate.  Could it be that she had struck?\r\nThe firing continued as furious as ever.  No, it was impossible!\r\n\r\n\"See! see! there's another flying out!\" exclaimed the midshipman,\r\nexultingly.  \"All right, some fine fellow has climbed up and nailed it\r\nthere.  Only the halliards were shot away.  My captain would go down\r\nsooner than strike; I know that.\"\r\n\r\nThe loud reports of the guns came succeeding each other rapidly over the\r\ncalm ocean.  Now a loud crash, then a broadside was fired by both\r\nparties at once, the sound of the different guns blending into one; now\r\na perfect silence, and then again single shots, and after a cessation\r\nanother broadside.  At length the combatants scarcely moved, and became\r\nenshrouded in a dense cloud of smoke, which nearly concealed them from\r\nview.  The firing was more furious than ever.  They were yard-arm to\r\nyard-arm, discharging their broadsides into each other.  A light breeze\r\nplayed over the water--the ships emerged from the cloud of smoke.  The\r\nEnglish frigate had lost her mizen-mast, and its wreck lay over her\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nHarry groaned, but directly afterwards he shouted, \"They'll not give in,\r\nthough--they'll not give in, I am sure they won't.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE UNION JACK BEATS--THE RAFT STILL UNSEEN--THE PRIVATEER--DEATH OF OLD\r\nJEFFERIES--THE FRENCH CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nThe loss of her mizen-mast did not appear to damp the ardour of the\r\nBritish frigate's crew.  The firing was continued with unabated fury on\r\nboth sides, neither ship apparently moving through the water; now they\r\nwere shrouded in smoke--now the smoke was blown away, and the firing\r\nceased.  \"The Frenchman's foremast is tottering!\" shouted Harry.  \"See!\r\nsee!  David.  Down it comes--hurrah! hurrah!\"  Still the flags of their\r\nrespective countries waved at the mastheads of the frigates.  The mast\r\ndid not come down either when Harry thought it would, neither did the\r\nfiring cease altogether.  Faint sounds of musketry or pistol-shots came\r\nacross the water--then three or four great guns were fired--the sides of\r\nthe ships were close together, or rather, the bow of the English frigate\r\nwas fast to the Frenchman's side.\r\n\r\n\"They are boarding,\" cried Harry; \"I know it must be that--then our\r\nfellows will win the day.--The Frenchman's flag will be down directly.\r\nWatch! watch!  I know it will.\"\r\n\r\nThey waited eagerly, looking out for some time.  Suddenly a cloud of\r\nsmoke ascended from one of the ships.  It was difficult to say from\r\nwhich; again and again the guns were fired.  \"I am afraid that after all\r\nour friends are getting the worst of it,\" remarked David, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, no! impossible!\" exclaimed Harry.  \"See, see! down comes the\r\nFrenchman's flag--hurrah! hurrah!  I knew it would be so.  Englishmen\r\nare never licked.  We would go down first with our colours flying.\r\nHurrah! hurrah! we've gained the day.\"  Harry waved his cap above his\r\nhead, and shouted long and loudly, communicating his enthusiasm, not\r\nonly to David, but to the old man himself; but so vehement in his\r\ndemonstrations of joy did he become at last, that he nearly upset the\r\nraft, and then well-nigh fell overboard himself.  David was rather more\r\nquiet in his demonstrations, still he did not feel less satisfaction\r\nprobably than his friend.\r\n\r\n\"We must get on board to congratulate them,\" exclaimed Harry; \"I\r\nwouldn't miss that on any account; if we pull hard we shall be able to\r\nget up to them--eh, Mr Jefferies?  They will be some time repairing\r\ndamages and shifting the prisoners, and they are not likely to make sail\r\ntill then.\"\r\n\r\n\"We mustn't count too much upon that, young gentleman; we are further\r\noff than you think, and darkness will be down over the ocean long before\r\nwe can get up to them.  Besides, do you know, I don't think the sights\r\naboard those ships, either the conqueror or the conquered, would be so\r\npleasant as you suppose.  I know what a man-of-war is after a\r\nhard-fought battle.  The decks strewn with the dead, and slippery with\r\nblood and gore, the cockpit full of wounded men, lately strong and\r\nhardy, now cripples for life, many dying, entering into eternity,\r\nwithout a hope beyond their ocean grave, Christless, heathens in reality\r\nif not in name, stifled groans and sighs, and oftentimes shrieks of\r\ndespair on every side.  Such sights I have seen in my youth, and I speak\r\nthe language of some of the great preachers who have come down to these\r\nparts, and boldly put forth the gospel of salvation to perishing sinners\r\nunder the blue vault of heaven.  You only look at one side of the\r\npicture, and that quickly vanishes away; mine, unhappily, is too real to\r\nbe wiped out quickly.\"  The old man spoke in a tone he had not hitherto\r\nused, which showed that his education had been superior to that which\r\nmen of his vocation generally possess.\r\n\r\nThis remark, it must be confessed, considerably damped the ardour of the\r\nyoung midshipman.  The latter, however, still continued to urge him and\r\nDavid to try and get on board one of the ships.  They were in reality as\r\nanxious as he was to do so, for they could not but feel that they were\r\nexposed to many dangers while they remained on the raft.  The wind had\r\ndropped, and in one respect this was in their favour, as the frigates\r\ncould not sail away; but what little wind there was was against them,\r\nand this made rowing their heavy craft more tedious.  They progressed\r\nvery slowly, and after two hours' hard rowing they seemed no nearer than\r\nbefore.  The day was drawing on; still they persevered.  Hope continued\r\nto cheer the two boys, whatever the old man might have thought about the\r\nmatter.  At last Harry stopped.  \"They are making sail, and the breeze\r\nis getting up.  Oh dear! oh dear!  They'll be off before we can reach\r\nthem.  Still we'll try--pull away, David, pull away, there's a good\r\nfellow.\"\r\n\r\nAll the efforts of the lads brought them no nearer the two frigates.\r\nThey could see the British ensign run up above that of the French.\r\nStill it was evident that they themselves were not observed: no wonder,\r\nunder the circumstances, as everybody on board must have been busily\r\nengaged.  Still thus, as it were, to be deserted, was very trying to the\r\nyoung lads.  They bore up, however, manfully under the disappointment.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the wind may fall or shift again, and they may have after all\r\nto take a tack this way,\" exclaimed Harry, whose hopeful enthusiasm it\r\nwas impossible to damp.  At last the night returned, and the darkness\r\nshut out the frigates from their sight.  The lads had to while away the\r\ntime by conversation, and expressed their intentions of not going to\r\nsleep during the night; they, however, stowed themselves away in their\r\naccustomed places, where, should they by any chance begin to slumber,\r\nthey might not run the risk of falling into the sea.  For some time they\r\nkept to this resolution, Harry still buoyed up with the hope that they\r\nmight get on board the frigate in the morning.  At last David's voice\r\nbegan to get very drowsy, so even did Harry's, and in spite of their\r\nstrange position and their anxiety, first one and then the other dropped\r\noff to sleep.  The old man leaned forward to ascertain that they were\r\nboth secure.\r\n\r\n\"Sleep on, lads! sleep on!\" he muttered.  \"He who reigns above can alone\r\ntell whether or not this is the last night you will spend on earth.  I\r\nliked not the look of the sky when the sun went down, and before many\r\nhours have passed this frail raft may be tossing on an ocean of foaming\r\nseas.\"  The old man was silent, but he did not sleep.  Often he prayed.\r\nHe thought over many things of his past life, as men under such\r\ncircumstances are apt to do.  Happy are those who have not to reflect on\r\ncrimes committed, injuries done to others too late to remedy! and still\r\nmore fearful must be the thoughts of those who are not trusting to the\r\nperfect and complete sacrifice offered on Calvary--whose sins have not\r\nbeen washed away in the blood of the Lamb.  The old man knew in whom he\r\ntrusted, and no bitterness entered his thoughts.  The hours passed on;\r\nstars became obscured; clouds were seen chasing each other across the\r\ndark sky, slowly at first, then more and more rapidly; the raft began to\r\nrock, scarcely perceptibly, then gently, then with more and more\r\nmovement, but the boys slept on; accustomed to spend their time on the\r\nheaving wave, they did not feel the motion.  At length a grey cold light\r\nbegan gradually to steal over the foam-covered ocean.  The boys still\r\nslept on.  The old man alone was awake on the raft.  He lifted himself\r\nup, and bent forward as if in prayer.  Thus he remained for some time.\r\nAt length David, less accustomed to the sea than Harry, awoke from the\r\nmotion of the raft.  The exclamation to which he gave utterance aroused\r\nhis companion; David quickly started to his feet, and gazed anxiously\r\naround the horizon.  The two frigates had disappeared.  No sail was in\r\nsight; nothing was to be seen but the heavy leaden-coloured waves, while\r\nthe clouds seemed to come closely down on all sides.  The raft drove\r\nquickly on before the storm.\r\n\r\n\"In what direction are we going?\" asked David.\r\n\r\n\"To the south-west, I have an idea,\" answered Harry; \"but I should not\r\nmind that, if I thought we were likely to fall in with the two\r\nfrigates.\"\r\n\r\n\"Trust in God, my lads,\" said old Jefferies.\r\n\r\nHe spoke truly; for already the raft gave signs of breaking up, from the\r\nviolence to which it had been exposed.  The old man and the two boys did\r\nall they could to secure it more strongly by such ropes as they still\r\nhad to spare, but it was difficult and dangerous to move from their\r\npositions.  The seas followed rapidly, and more than once had almost\r\nbroken over them.  Still, while their mast stood, and they could keep\r\ntheir sail set, they hoped to continue running before the sea.  They\r\nspoke but little to each other, and continued looking out on either\r\nside, in the hope of seeing some vessels which might afford them a\r\nrefuge.  Still none appeared.  The old man continued steering the raft\r\nwith great judgment and dexterity, but it was clear that the gale was\r\nincreasing, and that in a very short time the frail structure on which\r\nthey floated could not hold together amidst the fierce waves to which it\r\nwould be exposed.  Still, serious as was their position, the boys did\r\nnot forget that they had had nothing to eat since the previous night.\r\nHarry dived down into their provision-box, and produced some biscuits\r\nand a piece of tongue.  Their first care was to offer some to the old\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you, good lads, I've no hunger,\" he answered.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their pressing, he refused to take any of the food.\r\n\r\n\"I can't say that I'm not hungry,\" cried Harry, \"though I'm afraid we\r\nmust go without our tea.\"\r\n\r\nDavid, who felt something like old Jefferies, when pressed, however, by\r\nHarry, gladly joined him in discussing such provisions as they could\r\neasily get at.  Both of them were much refreshed by the nourishment, and\r\nin spite of the foreboding looks of the old man could not help holding\r\nsanguine hopes of escaping from their perilous position.  Still they\r\nwere hoping against hope, for in spite of the additional lashings they\r\nhad cast round their raft, first one piece of plank and then another was\r\ntorn off.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on tight!\" cried Harry, as he gazed astern, \"here comes a\r\ntremendous sea, and I don't know how we shall keep before it.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke a high foaming wave came roaring up.  Already the raft was\r\nmounting a wave in front, or the consequences would have been more\r\ndisastrous.  The upper part of the sea broke completely over the raft,\r\nbut it still floated on.  Those on it looked anxiously round to see if\r\nany of their number were missing.  The old man was still at his post at\r\nthe helm, and the two boys at their places.  It was evident, however,\r\nthat a few more such seas would utterly destroy the raft.  As Harry\r\nagain gazed astern, he saw to his dismay many similar seas preparing to\r\nfollow; still he would not say this, even to David, and tried in his own\r\nhearty way to keep up his companions' spirits.  An hour or so thus\r\npassed away, when the raft gave stronger signs than ever of not having\r\npower to hold together.\r\n\r\n\"How fearful it would be if we were separated!\" said David, who clearly\r\ncomprehended what was likely to happen.  Just then another tremendous\r\nsea came rolling up, and washed over the raft.  The boys clung on for\r\ntheir lives, but when the raft once more rose to the surface, the mast\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\n\"No hope, I fear,\" said David.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is!\" cried Harry; \"I see a vessel bearing down directly for\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys eagerly turned their eyes towards the stranger.  It seemed\r\ndoubtful, however, whether the raft would hold together till her\r\narrival, or whether they could avoid being washed off the raft by the\r\nsea, which kept continually rolling over them.  On she rapidly came.\r\n\r\n\"I don't much like her appearance,\" said the old man; \"she doesn't look\r\nmuch better than the craft which we before refused to go on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no choice at all,\" said Harry.  \"She looks like a Frenchman;\r\nbut even the Monsieurs, considering our circumstances, would not treat\r\nus otherwise than with kindness,\" said David.\r\n\r\nThe boys waved and shouted with all their might.  It seemed doubtful\r\nwhether or not they were observed; still the stranger, a large topsail\r\nschooner, was standing directly for them.  Presently they saw her\r\nshorten sail.\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" cried Harry; \"we're seen.\"\r\n\r\nShe rounded-to close to them, so close, indeed, that the two boys were\r\nable to grasp the ropes which were thrown to them, and were immediately\r\nhauled up on deck.\r\n\r\n\"But old Jefferies, we mustn't desert him!\" cried Harry, as he saw the\r\nold man still on the raft.  \"Here! fasten this rope round my waist, and\r\nI'll go and haul him in.\"\r\n\r\nThe crew of the stranger seemed to understand him, but at that moment a\r\nsea rolling up drove the raft completely under the schooner's bottom.  A\r\nfew fragments again appeared, but the old man was not to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, where is he? where is he?\" cried David and Harry; \"we must save the\r\ngood old man.\"\r\n\r\nThe people on board looked round on every side.  So deep was the grief\r\nof the boys for his loss, that they scarcely for the moment seemed to\r\nthink of their own preservation, nor of the character of the vessel on\r\nboard which they had got.  It was very clear that the old man had sunk\r\nfor ever, as no signs of him appeared.  Once more the vessel was put\r\nbefore the wind, and flew onward on her course.\r\n\r\nHarry and David, on looking round, observed she was an armed vessel,\r\ncarrying sixteen long guns, with swivels and other pieces.  From the\r\nlanguage they heard spoken by the crew, they knew she was French; while,\r\nfrom the varied dresses of the men and officers, they suspected she was\r\na privateer, and not a man-of-war.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid we shall not much like our quarters here,\" said Harry.  \"The\r\nbest thing we can do is to put a good face on the matter, and go aft and\r\nthank the captain for saving our lives; he will see by my uniform that I\r\nam an officer, and treat us as gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Harry's patch of white cloth, however, was not likely to be treated\r\nwith much respect by a French privateer captain of those days.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder which of these fellows is captain,\" said Harry, as they\r\napproached three or four rough-looking fellows, as they were walking the\r\ndeck with the air of officers.  \"Oh, I wonder whether they will\r\nunderstand English, for not a word of French can I speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor can I indeed,\" said David; \"I didn't think of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must make our intentions known, however,\" said Harry, \"and I must\r\nmuster up what I can say.  I know they always begin by saying `Monsieur'\r\nif they want to be polite, so I'll say `Monsieur Captain, Monsieur\r\nCaptain,'\" looking round as he spoke, \"we have to thank you for taking\r\nus aboard your vessel, and should be still further obliged if you could\r\ngive us a change of clothes while ours are drying.\"\r\n\r\nThe Frenchmen looked at the boys with an air of indifference.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Captain,\" again began Harry, \"I say we want to thank you for\r\npulling us out of the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the captain is not among these men,\" suggested David.\r\n\r\n\"I want to see the captain,\" said Harry, bowing as before.\r\n\r\nAt length a small wizen-faced man appeared from below.  His countenance\r\nwore anything but a pleasant aspect.  By his dress, and the respect with\r\nwhich the others seemed to treat him, the boys had little doubt that he\r\nwas the person of whom they were in search.  They accordingly approached\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the captain?\" said Harry, bowing as before, for he did not\r\nforget his politeness, in spite of his wet clothes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am,\" said the wizen-faced man.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you speak English; how glad we are!\" answered Harry, \"because we\r\ncan thus thank you for saving our lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"No great reason to thank me,\" said the man, in an unpleasant tone.\r\n\r\n\"You speak English very well, sir,\" said Harry, wishing to soothe him.\r\n\r\n\"I have had plenty of time to learn it,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Where was that, sir?\" asked Harry.\r\n\r\n\"In an English prison,\" answered the Frenchman, with a grin, turning on\r\nhis heel; \"and I've no great cause to love those who kept me there, or\r\ntheir countrymen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid we've gained very little by the expression of our\r\ngratitude,\" said David; \"what are we to do?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nTHE GOOD-NATURED SEAMEN--PIERRE LAMONT--DAVID'S EMPLOYMENT--THE\r\nREPUBLICAN OFFICER.\r\n\r\nNo one seemed disposed to pay the slightest attention to the two boys.\r\nThe officers glanced at them superciliously.  The captain, after taking\r\na few turns on deck, scowled on them as he passed on his way below.\r\nThey were left standing on the deck of the schooner, which went flying\r\non before the still increasing gale.  They were wet and cold, and\r\ngrieving for the loss of their old friend, as well as very anxious about\r\nthe sorrow their absence would cause their relatives at home.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose the Frenchmen won't let us starve altogether,\" said David.\r\n\"The officers indeed don't seem inclined to treat us well, but perhaps\r\nthe men may be differently disposed.  I propose that, having done what\r\nwe considered our duty, we go forward and throw ourselves upon their\r\nkindness.  Still, as I'm a quarter-deck officer, we ought to be treated\r\nwith respect by the officers.  I'm sure, if we had picked up two French\r\nmidshipmen on board our frigate, we should have made regular pets of\r\nthem, and given them no cause to complain.\"\r\n\r\n\"But remember this is not a frigate,\" observed David; \"I think it will\r\nbe wiser to put our dignity in our pockets, and make the best of things\r\nas they are.\"\r\n\r\nStill Harry held out for some little time; but at length the surly looks\r\nof the officers, not to mention his hunger, made him yield to David's\r\nsuggestions, and they quietly worked their way forward.  As soon as the\r\nbacks of the officers were turned the men came round them, and by the\r\nexpression of their countenances showed that they at least bore them no\r\nill-will.  One or two, by signs, invited them below, and they were very\r\nglad to escape from the cold autumn gale which was blowing through their\r\nwet clothes.  Although unable to communicate by words, the lads had no\r\ndifficulty in making their wishes known to the Frenchmen by signs.  Some\r\ndry clothes were quickly produced from the bag of a young seaman.  As\r\nsoon as Harry and David had dressed themselves in these, some provisions\r\nand a bottle of wine were brought to them, the Frenchmen standing round\r\nlooking on with great satisfaction while they discussed them.\r\n\r\n\"_Buvez, me amis_,\" said a stout good-natured looking seaman, pouring\r\nout a glass of claret.  The boys guessed by his signs clearly enough\r\nwhat he said, and thanked him by nodding in return.  They both felt\r\nconsiderably better for their repast.\r\n\r\n\"If it wasn't for the loss of poor old Jefferies, I should not have\r\nminded it at all,\" said David; \"but for him to lose his life, and for us\r\nto find ourselves little better than prisoners on board a Frenchman, is\r\nvery trying.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you remember, nearly his last words were, `Trust in God,'\" remarked\r\nHarry; \"so let us go on trusting; he was a good old man, and is gone to\r\nheaven I'm sure, so we ought not to mourn for him much.  It would have\r\nbroken his heart to find himself on board this vessel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder in what direction we are going?\" said David.\r\n\r\n\"I will try and get a look at the compass when we go on deck again, but\r\nwe mustn't let the Frenchmen think we care anything about the matter,\"\r\nsaid Harry.\r\n\r\n\"What a pity it is we can't talk French a little!  I wish we could thank\r\nthese kind, good-natured fellows, because really I am very grateful for\r\ntheir kindness to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"At all events, we can do it by signs,\" said Harry, jumping up and\r\nshaking the Frenchman by the hand who had given them the wine.\r\n\r\n\"Much obliged, monsieur; much obliged for your good dinner; the sausages\r\nwere excellent.  We don't often taste such claret at sea as you gave\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, though the Frenchman did not understand a word Harry had\r\nsaid, yet he was evidently in the way of becoming a favourite among\r\nthem.  When invited to return on deck they did not hesitate to do so,\r\nfor by keeping forward they were not recognised among the French crew.\r\nIn the evening they were again invited to join the mess of the men\r\nbelow, which, if not quite in accordance with English notions, was not\r\nquite the wretched fare on which Frenchmen are supposed to exist.\r\nIndeed, it must be owned that the provisions were far better cooked and\r\nmade into more palatable messes than they would have been on board an\r\nEnglish vessel of the same character.  At night they had a berth\r\nallotted to them in a standing bed-place forward, into which they were\r\ntoo glad to creep.  Having thanked the God of mercy who had thus\r\npreserved them, in a prayer which came from the very bottom of their\r\nhearts, and asked for a blessing on all those they had left at home,\r\nthey lay down in their narrow berth, and stowed themselves away as well\r\nas space would allow.  They had reason to be thankful that they had\r\nescaped the perils to which they had been exposed for so many nights on\r\nthe raft; and though their sleeping-place was very close and dark, it\r\nhad the advantage of being dry.  They were very quickly fast asleep, in\r\nspite of all the rolling and pitching of the vessel, as she dashed\r\nforward across the stormy ocean.  There was no danger of their being\r\npitched out.  In spite of the groaning of the bulkheads, the whistling\r\nof the wind through the rigging, the loud dash of the seas against the\r\nvessel, and the numerous other loud wild sounds which are heard during a\r\ngale at sea, the boys slept on till a gleam of daylight found its way\r\ndown to their narrow berth.\r\n\r\n\"_Mangez, mangez, mes amis_!\" said a voice, which was recognised as that\r\nof their kind friend of the previous evening.  He had come, it appeared,\r\nto summon them to breakfast, for the crew were employed below in\r\ndiscussing that meal.  Once on their feet, the boys found themselves\r\nperfectly ready to join their French friends, and to do ample justice to\r\nthe food placed before them.\r\n\r\n\"If it were not for the dignity of the thing we should not be so badly\r\noff, after all,\" said Harry; \"but really I cannot quite get over the\r\nskipper not treating us as officers, as he should have done.\"\r\n\r\nThe Frenchmen greeted them with kind smiles, and soon again reconciled\r\nthem to their wretched fate.\r\n\r\nThe gale now increased to a regular hurricane.  The schooner ran before\r\nit under a close-reefed fore-topsail, but even then the seas followed so\r\nrapidly that there appeared great probability of their breaking on\r\nboard.  Both officers and men either remained below, or, when necessity\r\ncompelled them to be on deck, kept close to the bulwarks, that they\r\nmight have something to catch hold of should an accident occur.  Under\r\nthese circumstances no work was expected to be done; the boys were\r\ntherefore allowed to do just as they pleased.  They wisely kept forward\r\namong their friends the seamen.  They had observed a boy about their own\r\nage eyeing them occasionally as he passed sometimes with a dish from the\r\ncook's caboose, or with various messages with which he seemed to be\r\ngenerally employed; yet he had not hitherto spoken to them.\r\n\r\n\"I like his looks,\" said David; \"I can't help fancying that he wants to\r\nbe friendly.  Next time he passes us I will say something to him; or\r\nsee, I've got a knife in my pocket; I'll present it to him, it will show\r\nour good-will.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be very much like purchasing kindness,\" answered Harry.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes after this the boy again came near.\r\n\r\n\"Here, garcon,\" said David, pulling out his knife as he spoke, \"take\r\nthis, you may find it very useful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Merci,\" said the boy, \"thank you--much obliged.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! do you speak English?\" asked David.\r\n\r\n\"Very little, but I know what you say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we're so glad of that,\" exclaimed the two boys in the same breath.\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\" asked David.\r\n\r\n\"Pierre Lamont,\" answered the French boy.\r\n\r\n\"We shall be friends,\" said David.  \"You don't hate the English, I hope,\r\nlike the captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, no,\" answered Pierre, \"I love the English; my poor mother was\r\nEnglish, but she is dead, and so is my father, but he was French.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then have you no one to look after you?\" exclaimed David, in a tone of\r\ncommiseration.\r\n\r\n\"No, I am all alone in the world, no one to care for me,\" said Pierre.\r\n\r\n\"Are you happy here on board this ship?\" asked Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, no.  Sometimes I am pretty well off; but often our cruel men\r\norder me about, and beat me with the rope's-end if I do not do quickly\r\nwhat they command.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, Harry,\" said David, \"there's one on board this ship worse off\r\nthan we are.  We have some dear friends on shore, and though they don't\r\nknow what has become of us, we hope that they are are safe, and that we\r\nshall get back to them some day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know where we're going, Pierre?\" asked Harry.  \"I wanted to look\r\nat the compass; but I'm afraid of going aft, lest I should meet the\r\ncaptain.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right to keep away from him,\" answered Pierre.  \"If he knew\r\neven that I spoke English he would treat me worse than he does.  But you\r\nask where are we going.  I believe that we're bound out to the West\r\nIndies to take as many English merchant-vessels as we can find.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought we were going in that direction,\" answered David.\r\n\r\n\"But, Pierre, do you think if any of the English vessels are defended,\r\nthat the captain will make us fight against our own countrymen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you may depend on that,\" said Pierre.  \"That is, you will be\r\nemployed in bringing up powder from below.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! shall we be turned into powder-monkeys?\" exclaimed Harry, in a\r\ntone of indignation.  \"That will be too bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that what you call the boys who bring up the powder?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but only the smallest among the ship's crew are employed in that\r\nwork, and they should not treat officers in that way, even though we are\r\ntheir enemies,\" exclaimed Harry, indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"That is the very reason the captain will take delight in giving you\r\nsuch employment,\" said Pierre.  \"No one likes him on board.  Even the\r\nofficers fear him; but he is said to be a very good seaman and a daring\r\ncharacter, so brave that he cares for nothing.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this account of the captain the boys saw that they were not far\r\nwrong in the opinion they had formed of him from his countenance and his\r\nmanner towards them.  They resolved, therefore, to keep out of his way,\r\nand to avoid irritating him if they could.  While the gale continued he\r\nhad quite enough to do to look after the vessel without troubling\r\nhimself about them.  Indeed, as far as they could judge, he had\r\nforgotten that they were on board.  Although the place below where they\r\nsat with the men was close and dark in consequence of being battened\r\ndown, they spent much of their time there.  Many of the men were\r\nemployed in various works.  Several were making models of vessels in a\r\nway few English seamen could have done.  David proposed doing something\r\nof the sort, to show the Frenchmen that he did not wish to be idle, and\r\nthat he felt himself at home among them.  He asked Pierre to get him\r\nsome corks, and to set to work to make a model of a village church.\r\nThis, with the aid of some pins, he rapidly accomplished with a file\r\nwhich he borrowed from one of the men, and he drew down the warm\r\ncommendations of his companions, who were especially well disposed to\r\nappreciate such efforts.  He accordingly presented it to his stout\r\nfriend, Jacques Rossillion, the good-natured seaman who had from the\r\nfirst taken an interest in him.\r\n\r\nThus several days passed away till the gale abated, the sea went down,\r\nand sail was once more made on the schooner.  Harry had been perhaps\r\nunwisely anxious to put on his own uniform again, which was now\r\nthoroughly dry and fit to wear.  Pierre advised him not to appear before\r\nthe captain in it.  \"Still it's my proper dress,\" answered Harry, who,\r\nlike many midshipmen, was very tenacious on that subject.  The gale,\r\nwhich had been in their favour, had carried them a long way towards\r\ntheir destination, as they judged by the warmth of the atmosphere and\r\nthe tropical appearance of the sea.  The officers as usual paced the\r\nquarter-deck, and the men congregated together forward.  A monkey, which\r\nhad hitherto stowed himself away somewhere out of sight, was among the\r\noccupants of the deck.  To an English crew a monkey is a great\r\nacquisition, but a French ship's company can scarcely get on without\r\none.  When they are inclined to play pranks he is always at their\r\nservice, and woe betide the unhappy small boy of a ship's company on\r\nwhose muster-roll a monkey is not to be found! as he has to endure what\r\nthe four-handed animal would otherwise have to go through.\r\n\r\nOn looking over the side Harry observed a black fin gliding along at the\r\nsame rate as the schooner.  \"Look there, David; did you ever see a\r\nregular shark before?\" he said.  \"If anybody was to fall overboard that\r\nfellow would snap him in two in half a second.  The best swimmer would\r\nhave but a poor chance unless he was well prepared.  I have heard of a\r\nsailor attacking a shark with a knife in his hand, and cutting him up;\r\nbut a man only with iron nerves and great presence of mind and a good\r\nswimmer could ever make the attempt.\"  While they were speaking the\r\ncaptain appeared on deck.  \"Here, you boys, come aft,\" he shouted.\r\n\"What, do you think you are to pass away your time in idleness, and get\r\nfed and grow fat?  You are very much mistaken if you think any such\r\nthing.  Take each of you a tar-bucket, and go and black down the rigging\r\nfrom the fore-topmast head.\"  Poor Harry looked at his uniform; it had\r\nendured the wetting, but it would be spoiled in a few minutes by the\r\noperation which he was ordered to perform.  He saw that it would not do\r\nto disobey the captain's orders.  If they had time to find Pierre they\r\nmight borrow some frocks and canvas trousers.\r\n\r\n\"I say what I mean,\" shouted the captain; \"and off with you at once--one\r\ntaking the starboard, and one the larboard rigging.  What, you don't\r\nlike to spoil your clothes, I see.  I was not allowed any clothes to\r\nspoil when I was in an English prison.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely you will let us borrow some frocks, sir,\" answered David.\r\n\"Though we are gentlemen, and unaccustomed to such work, we are willing\r\nto obey you, only we don't want to spoil our clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aloft, I say, or overboard you go.  There's a fellow alongside ready to\r\nbreakfast off you, if you are anxious to feed him.\"  The little\r\nFrenchman looked so fierce that the boys really believed he was in\r\nearnest.\r\n\r\n\"It can't be helped,\" said David.  \"You must tell me what to do, for I\r\nnever blacked down rigging even on board the yacht.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just secure the bucket as you descend, and take care not to let the tar\r\ndrop from the brush on deck.  It's not the difficulty of the thing, but\r\nit is very derogatory.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing that there was no use in further expostulation, the boys took\r\neach of them a bucket as they were ordered, and ascended, one on one\r\nside, and one on the other, of the fore-rigging, and having reached the\r\nmasthead Harry secured his bucket, and showed David how to secure his.\r\nThe operation, besides being a very dirty one, was tedious, as each rope\r\nhad to be gone carefully round with the tar.  Often they made melancholy\r\nfaces at each other as they gradually descended, but neither the captain\r\nnor officers showed the slightest commiseration, only watching\r\napparently to see that the work was effectually performed.  While the\r\ncaptain remained on deck the crew took no notice of them.  This was,\r\nhowever, evidently done in kindness.  At length the work was over, and,\r\nseeing the captain on deck, they thought the best way was to go aft and\r\nreport what they had done.  \"Very well,\" said the captain; \"tomorrow you\r\nwill black down the main-rigging; in the meantime I want to see a polish\r\nput upon those brass stanchions, and the swivel guns are not so bright\r\nas they should be.  I shall have work for you in my cabin, too, by and\r\nby.  You are young English gentlemen, I understand.  You may consider it\r\na privilege to have to serve a poor republican seaman, who has worked\r\nhis way up from before the mast.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will do our best to obey you, sir,\" answered David, who wisely\r\nwished to conciliate the man, in spite of his surly manners.  He\r\nremembered that \"a soft answer turneth away wrath.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nTHE PRISONERS HAVE TO WORK--THE CHASE--THE MERCHANT SHIP IS TAKEN--THE\r\nBOYS FIND THEIR FRIEND CAPTAIN RYMER AND MARY--THE HURRICANE.\r\n\r\nNext morning, as soon as the boys appeared on deck, the captain again\r\ncalled them aft.\r\n\r\n\"Aloft with you, lads, and black down the main-rigging,\" he exclaimed as\r\nthey approached him, looking more humble even than they felt.  Knowing,\r\nhowever, that there was no use in refusing to do what they were ordered,\r\nHarry and David took up the buckets to which the captain pointed, and\r\nascended as before.\r\n\r\n\"We must look out not to drop any tar on deck,\" said Harry, \"he will\r\nmake it an excuse to give us a rope's-ending if we do; I'm sure he means\r\nmischief.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys soon gained the masthead, and began their very disagreeable\r\ntask.  The sun was extremely hot; the ship rolled slowly from side to\r\nside as she glided on before the wind.  Poor David felt very sick and\r\nwretched; more than once he thought he must give in, but Harry cheered\r\nhim by exclaiming--\r\n\r\n\"Let us show that we are Englishmen, and at all events that we are not\r\nto be daunted by any work these Frenchmen can give us.\"\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, David, who really had as much spirit as Harry,\r\ndetermined to persevere.  The work, however, progressed more slowly than\r\non the previous day.  Several times the captain came on deck and watched\r\nthem; they continued their work as it they did not observe him.  By the\r\ntime it was completed, as may be supposed, their clothing was entirely\r\nspoiled.  As they stepped on deck he grinned at them maliciously.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! now you look what you must in future expect to be,\" he remarked;\r\n\"go forward and stow away those buckets, and then come aft to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what he is going to make us do next?\" said Harry, as they\r\nhanded the buckets over to the boatswain.  Poor David, overcome with the\r\nheat, scarcely answered.  A cup of water which he had obtained from a\r\ncask on deck somewhat revived him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we must go aft, and face it out as best we can,\" he answered;\r\n\"come along, I'm ready.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain ordered them into his cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads, I want that furniture cleaned; the brass has not been\r\nburnished for some time.\"  He put some leather into their hands.  The\r\ndifficulty of the work was not so great, but it was evidently given to\r\ninsult them on account of its menial character.  Harry especially felt\r\nthis.  Still they had no resource but to obey, and scrubbed away with\r\nmight and main.  At last the captain came below.\r\n\r\n\"Now, you young English midshipman, I've some special work for you to\r\ndo.  See that locker; there are several pairs of boots and shoes--you'll\r\nfind a blacking-bottle and brushes.  I want them cleaned.\"  Harry's\r\nproud spirit rose within him.  Should he defy the tyrannical captain,\r\nand declare that he would die sooner than so employ himself?  The\r\ncaptain seemed to divine his thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"As you please, youngster,\" he observed; \"no one disobeys me on board\r\nthis vessel.\"\r\n\r\nHarry remembered the shark, and the captain's threat on the previous\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  I will help you,\" said David, looking at him.\r\n\r\n\"No, it is his work,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\nPoor Harry saw there was no use in offering any resistance, and taking\r\nout the brushes began to clean the shoes.  It was a work which a\r\nmidshipman in those days often had to perform for himself; but then it\r\nwas very different doing it for another, and that other a Frenchman.  At\r\nlength, however, the boys were dismissed, having performed all the tasks\r\ngiven to them.  They hurried forward and dived below.  The first person\r\nthey met was Pierre, who looked with commiseration on their tarred\r\ndresses.\r\n\r\n\"I came on board with a nice clean suit, and had to spoil it just as you\r\nhave had to spoil yours,\" he observed; \"and now he abuses me when I go\r\ninto his cabin, for not looking clean.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this the boys were regularly sent aft to help wash down decks, and\r\nto keep the stanchions and other parts about the ship bright.  This gave\r\nthem abundant occupation.  However, when they could manage to get below,\r\nthey were treated even more kindly than before by the crew.\r\n\r\nThey had been for some weeks cruising up and down without even sighting\r\na sail, when one morning, on Harry and David coming on deck, they found\r\nthe captain and officers in a considerable state of excitement.  The\r\ncaptain himself went aloft with his glass, and on his return ordered the\r\nship's course to be altered, and all sail to be set.\r\n\r\n\"We are in chase of some vessel or other,\" observed Harry; \"depend upon\r\nit the Frenchmen expect to make a prize of her.\"\r\n\r\nAll hands were called on deck.  Now one sail and now another was\r\nadded,--some rigged out so as just to skim the surface of the water,\r\nwhile with buckets and scoops the sails were wetted as high as they\r\ncould be reached.  Harry and David could see in the far distance a large\r\nship, which from her narrow yards and the cut of her sails Harry said he\r\nthought was really a merchantman, which of course the Frenchman took her\r\nto be.\r\n\r\n\"But suppose she is not,\" said David.\r\n\r\n\"Then they will find out that they have caught a Tartar, and we shall\r\nget out of the power of this Monsieur Sourcrout,\" answered Harry;\r\n\"however, we mustn't raise our hopes too high.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ship ahead has shown English colours,\" the boys heard from some of\r\nthe crew, for they could not get a glass to look through.  She, it\r\nseemed, did not like the appearance of the stranger, for she now set all\r\nsail and went off also directly before the wind.  A stern chase is a\r\nlong chase, but if the chaser is a faster vessel than the chased, she\r\nwill come up with her at last.  As the day drew on it was very evident\r\nthat the schooner had gained very considerably on the chase.  She was\r\nseen to be an old-fashioned merchant vessel, a regular West India\r\ntrader, probably, which would afford a rich prize to the captors.\r\n\r\nThe excitement of the captain and officers was extreme.  Already they\r\nanticipated the rich booty which would soon be theirs.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! do you think those people on board that vessel will give in without\r\nfighting?\" asked David.\r\n\r\n\"I think very likely not,\" said Harry; \"we shall soon know; in less than\r\nan hour we shall be alongside.\"\r\n\r\n\"What had we better do?\" asked David.\r\n\r\n\"Stay on deck and see what takes place,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\n\"What, and run the chance of being shot?\" said David; \"I don't think\r\nthat would be wise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let us wait and see till the time comes,\" said Harry, who was\r\nevidently very unwilling to go below while any fighting was taking\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Frenchmen were very active in preparing the ship for\r\naction.  Arm-chests were thrown open, and arms were handed to each of\r\nthe crew.  The cutlasses were secured to their waists, and the pistols\r\nthey stuck in their belts.  The guns were cast loose and loaded, and the\r\nFrench ensign run up at the peak.  The magazine was opened, and Harry\r\nand David were called aft by the captain, and told to go below.\r\n\r\n\"I knew that's what we should have to do,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Stand by, and hand up the powder as it is wanted,\" said the captain, in\r\nan authoritative tone, which there was no disobeying.  Pierre and the\r\nother boys were employed in the same way.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to carry the powder on deck in these tubs, and sit on it\r\ntill it is wanted,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\n\"And run as great a risk of being shot as any of the crew?\" asked David.\r\n\r\n\"There's no help for it,\" said Harry.  \"If we refuse, the French skipper\r\nis just as likely to shoot us through the head as not.  He's been\r\nwaiting for this opportunity to have his revenge on us.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the guns were loaded, a fresh supply of powder was called\r\nfor, and Harry and the other boys were ordered to carry it up on deck.\r\nThere they sat in a row on the tubs which contained the bags of powder,\r\nlooking anything but contented with their lot.  The schooner now rapidly\r\ncame up with the merchant vessel,--for such there seemed no doubt was\r\nthe character of the chase.  Whether or not she would fight seemed a\r\nquestion.  As they drew nearer, a considerable number of men were seen\r\non deck, and she gave no signs of yielding.  As soon as the Frenchman's\r\nbow-chaser could be brought to bear, a shot was fired, but no reply was\r\ngiven.  Another and another followed in rapid succession.  Neither of\r\nthe shots took effect.  At length the schooner got near enough to fire a\r\nwhole broadside.  As she was about to do so, the ship hauled up her\r\ncourses, and, standing across the Frenchman's bows, gave her a raking\r\nbroadside which struck down several of her crew, and caused some little\r\ndamage to her masts and spars.  Harry and David looked anxiously towards\r\neach other.  Neither of them was hurt, nor was Pierre, in whom they took\r\na warm interest.  This opposition, however, seemed to excite the captain\r\nto the utmost pitch of fury.  He stamped and swore, and ordered a\r\nbroadside to be immediately poured into the English ship.  The two\r\nvessels now ran on alongside each other.  It was clear if the English\r\nvessel was to be taken, she would not be captured without a severe\r\nstruggle.  The Frenchman's guns were heavier and more numerous than\r\nhers, and the crew were better trained to their use.  This soon began to\r\ntell.  Several of her spars were soon shot away, and from the faintness\r\nof her fire it seemed too probable that many of her crew had been killed\r\nor wounded.  As long as the Frenchman's spars remained standing, to\r\nescape was hopeless, and her guns were therefore directed rather to\r\nknock away the Frenchman's masts than to kill the crew.  In this,\r\nhowever, she was not successful, and several of her own spars were shot\r\naway instead.  At length the French captain, delivering another\r\nbroadside, ranged up alongside with the intention of boarding.  An\r\nattempt was made to avoid this, and boarding nettings were seen triced\r\nup above the bulwarks of the English ship.  Again the Frenchman ran\r\nalongside.\r\n\r\n\"They shall not foil us a second time,\" exclaimed the French captain;\r\n\"no quarter if they do not yield.\"\r\n\r\nHarry and David trembled for the fate of their unfortunate countrymen on\r\nboard the merchantman.  Just then the English ensign was seen to descend\r\nfrom the peak.  Those on board the English vessel thought that further\r\nresistance was hopeless.  The Frenchmen swarmed up the sides, and were\r\nquickly in possession of the English ship.\r\n\r\n\"We'll follow, and see what takes place,\" said Harry; \"we may perhaps\r\nhelp some of the poor people.\"\r\n\r\nAs there was no one to interfere with them, they were soon on the\r\nmerchantman's deck.  Some five or six of the crew lay dead, while three\r\nor four others, badly wounded, were being conveyed below.  The French\r\ncaptain, by his gestures, seemed disappointed at not having his expected\r\nrevenge, and he was abusing the English captain for having attempted to\r\noppose him.  A man stood by, receiving the swords of the captain and\r\nseveral other persons, who seemed to be gentlemen.  Harry and David\r\nobserved one whose face had been turned away from them at first.\r\n\r\n\"Harry,\" exclaimed David, \"I'm sure that's Captain Rymer.  If Mary is on\r\nboard, how dreadful for her!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's very like him,\" said Harry; \"I'm afraid it must be him.  But how\r\ncould he have come on board the ship?  We shall soon know, at all\r\nevents--I will try and speak to him.\"\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, even their dearest friends would not have known the\r\ntwo lads in their tarry clothes, and their faces begrimed with powder.\r\nAs soon as the French captain and his followers went below to examine\r\nthe cargo of the ship, Harry and David stole up to the gentleman whom\r\nthey supposed to be Captain Rymer.  He was indeed their friend.\r\n\r\n\"What, lads!\" he exclaimed, looking at them, \"are you really alive?  I\r\nam thankful to find you so, even in this plight.\"\r\n\r\nHarry rapidly explained how they came to be on board the French vessel.\r\n\r\n\"And is Mary with you?\" asked Harry, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and there are several other ladies in the cabin below.  They have\r\nshut themselves in, and I trust will receive no annoyance from the\r\nFrenchmen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think we should be seen talking with you,\" said Harry, \"because\r\nwe may hope to be of some assistance, although we don't see clearly how\r\nthat is to be just yet.\"\r\n\r\nThe Frenchmen seemed highly elated at finding they had captured an\r\nunusually rich prize, and were in a very good humour, in spite of the\r\nloss of a few of their number.  The dead were soon thrown overboard, and\r\nthe wounded placed in the doctor's hands out of sight, the decks washed\r\ndown, and most of the traces of the combat done away with.  A picked\r\ncrew of the Frenchmen was sent on board the English merchantman, which\r\nit seemed the intention of the captain to carry into the nearest port in\r\nthe West Indies belonging to France.  Harry and David could not bear the\r\nthoughts of being separated from Captain Rymer, and resolved to stow\r\nthemselves away on board the English vessel, hoping they might not be\r\nmissed.  Among the prize crew were, to their great satisfaction, their\r\ngood-natured friends Jacques Rossillion and Pierre Lamont.  The first\r\nlieutenant came to take the command.  The Frenchmen more than doubled\r\nthe remainder of the English crew, who, however, were expected to assist\r\nin working the ship.  Scarcely had these arrangements been made when a\r\nstrong breeze sprang up.  The boats were hoisted in, and the two vessels\r\nseparated.  The wind increased very rapidly, and so heavy a sea got up\r\nthat it would have been dangerous for a boat to pass from one vessel to\r\nthe other.  Before long, however, the schooner ranged up near the ship.\r\n\r\n\"You have got those two English boys on board; give them the\r\nrope's-end,\" shouted the French captain, who, apparently, had only just\r\nthen discovered that Harry and David had escaped him.\r\n\r\nThe French lieutenant replied that he would see to it, and again the\r\nvessels separated.  He, however, had never looked at them in the same\r\nsurly way the other officers had done, and as they took good care to\r\nkeep out of his sight, he seemed to forget the orders he had received.\r\nThe wind went on increasing till it seemed likely to become a regular\r\nhurricane.  The management of the ship completely occupied the French\r\ncrew, so that they had but little time to look after their prisoners.\r\nThe English captain and his officers were ordered to remain as prisoners\r\nin one of the cabins with a sentinel placed over them, but the rest of\r\nthe crew were allowed to go about at liberty.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think it would be possible to get back the ship?\" said Harry\r\nto David.  \"Shall I propose to make the attempt to Captain Rymer?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it was not for Mary and the other ladies,\" said David, \"he might\r\nconsent; but the risk to them would be too fearful were we to fail.\"\r\n\r\nHitherto they had not had the opportunity of seeing Mary.  Finding,\r\nhowever, that the Frenchmen as well as the English crew were engaged in\r\nmaking the ship snug, they stole aft and found their way to the cabin\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\"May we come in?\" said Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" answered a voice, which they thought was Mary's.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, they opened the door and presented themselves, for a\r\nminute Mary could scarcely recognise them, so changed were they since\r\nthe day they had parted from her after the picnic--Harry in his bright\r\nnew uniform, and David in his trim yachtsman's attire.  Now their hair\r\nwas long, their cheeks were sunken, at least so far as could be seen\r\nthrough the powder which begrimed them, and their dresses were covered\r\nfrom head to foot with tar; still, the moment they spoke, she sprang\r\nforward and took them warmly by the hands.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am so thankful that you have not been lost, as we thought you\r\nwere,\" she exclaimed, and the tears came into her eyes; \"this is a very\r\nsad way of meeting, but still I hope God will protect us all, and I am\r\nthankful to see you both.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the ladies, who were all passengers, were eager to hear of the\r\nboys' adventures.  These they briefly gave.  Some, however, were too\r\nfrightened by the sound of the hurricane, and the tossing and rolling of\r\nthe ship, to listen to them.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think there is any danger?\" at last asked Mary of Harry.\r\n\r\n\"I hope not,\" said Harry, \"but Captain Rymer knows more about it than I\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Rymer, who at this moment entered the cabin, looked somewhat\r\nanxious, though he endeavoured to speak in a cheerful voice, and began\r\nto express his satisfaction at the escape of his young friends from the\r\nnumerous dangers to which they had been exposed.  Night was now coming\r\non, and it was evident that the ship was in the midst of a regular West\r\nIndian hurricane.  The French officer was evidently a good seaman, and\r\ndid all that could be done under the circumstances for the safety of the\r\nship.  The topgallant-masts were struck, and every sail was furled\r\nexcept a closely reefed fore-topsail, with which the ship ran before the\r\ngale.  Night had now come on; the wind, as is generally the case during\r\na hurricane, shifted so much that it was difficult to ascertain in what\r\ndirection she was driving.  Captain Rymer several times went on deck,\r\nbut had a not very satisfactory report to give on his return.\r\n\r\n\"As long as the ship does not spring a leak we have nothing to fear,\r\nhowever,\" he observed.\r\n\r\nStill the ship rolled and pitched so much that it seemed scarcely\r\npossible that a structure of wood and iron could hold together.  The\r\npoor ladies had to sit on the deck of the cabin and hold on by the legs\r\nof the table, while the lamp swung backwards and forwards in a way that\r\nthreatened every instant to cause its fracture.  Harry and David, though\r\nthey had seen enough of storms, agreed to go up on deck and see what was\r\ntaking place.  One glance satisfied them.  The mountain seas, covered\r\nwith white foam, were rolling up on either side of the ship, and\r\nthreatened every instant to come down upon her deck.  They gladly\r\ndescended again.\r\n\r\n\"I don't at all like the look of things, I confess,\" said David.  \"As\r\nlong, however, as Captain Rymer is satisfied that all is right, so\r\nshould we be.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nON A REEF--FATE OF THE FRENCH CREW--THE ISLAND--THE SHIPWRECKED PEOPLE--\r\nTHE FRENCH LIEUTENANT L'HIRONDELLE.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to relate that Captain Rymer was on his way, on\r\nboard the _Cerberus_, West Indian merchantman, to take the command to\r\nwhich he had been appointed when he was captured by the privateer.  He\r\nhad been too much accustomed to the ups and downs of a sailor's life to\r\nbe disheartened at what had occurred, though it was a great trial it\r\nmust be owned.  He had cause also to be grateful that he and his\r\ncompanions had not received that ill-usage to which passengers were too\r\noften subjected when their vessel was taken by a privateer.  It might\r\nhave been very different had the French captain himself remained on\r\nboard.  He had now, however, great cause for apprehension, in\r\nconsequence of the increasing violence of the hurricane.  The\r\n_Cerberus_, he knew, was a stout, strong-built ship, but many a stout\r\nship had gone down in a West Indian hurricane; not long before, several\r\nline-of-battle ships with all their gallant crews had been lost.  Things\r\non deck looked as bad as they well could do.  He was a Christian man,\r\nand put his trust in One who is all-able to save.  Thus he could impart\r\nhope and confidence to his companions.  Hitherto the ship had not sprung\r\na leak, and, as far as he could judge, they were at some distance from\r\nany land.  The French had, however, become alarmed.  Some, like true\r\nmen, stayed at their posts on deck, but the greater number had gone\r\nbelow and stowed themselves away in the berths.  A few had endeavoured\r\nto break open the spirit-room, but the French officers, suspecting their\r\nintentions, had been in time to prevent them, and threatened to shoot\r\nthe first man, whether Frenchman or Englishman, who would again make the\r\nattempt.  Order was thus kept on board.  No human power was longer of\r\nany avail in guiding the ship.  The hatches were battened down in time\r\nto prevent the seas, which now began to break on board, from washing\r\nbelow.  On she drove before the hurricane.  The caboose and spars were\r\nfirst washed away; then two of the quarter-boats shared the same fate.\r\nThe seas were making a clean sweep over the decks; still on she drove.\r\nNow part of the bulwarks were knocked to pieces, and it seemed that in a\r\nshort time everything on deck would follow; still the masts stood and\r\nthe ship floated.  There was hope, but it grew fainter and fainter; even\r\nthe stoutest hearts had cause to fear.  Several fearful hours followed.\r\nThe hurricane howled more loudly and fiercely around the ship, and the\r\nraging seas seemed to have gained her as their prey.\r\n\r\n\"Do you really think she will live through it?\" asked David of Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do think so; we've gone through so many dangers, that I can't\r\nfancy that we're to be lost at last,\" was Harry's reply.\r\n\r\nAnother and another hour passed away.  \"Surely the hurricane must come\r\nto an end at last,\" said David.  \"Did you ever know one last so long,\r\nCaptain Rymer?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"They seldom last more than twelve or fifteen hours, and this gives me\r\nhope that we shall escape,\" answered their friend.  \"I see a gleam of\r\ndaylight coming through a scuttle.  Depend upon it, before long the wind\r\nwill begin to fall.\"\r\n\r\nWhile they were speaking loud cries arose from those on deck.  \"Breakers\r\nahead!\" shouted the English crew.  Directly afterwards there was a\r\nfearful crash.\r\n\r\n\"We're cast upon a reef!\" exclaimed Harry; \"perhaps, after all, our last\r\nday is come.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Rymer set an example of coolness to his companions.  \"Remain\r\ntogether,\" he said to Mary and the other ladies, \"I will go on deck and\r\nascertain the state of affairs, and return for you, if there is a\r\nprospect of your reaching the shore.  We are in God's hands, and though\r\nwe may be unable to help ourselves, let us feel that He will care for\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus speaking, the ship seemed to be lifted by the seas,\r\nand then down she came again with another crash.  Just as Captain Rymer\r\nreached the deck, followed by David and Harry, the masts were seen to go\r\nby the board; the ship had struck upon a reef, over which the sea was\r\ndriving her, and inside of it the waters seemed comparatively calm.\r\n\r\n\"Why, men,\" shouted Captain Rymer to the crew, \"I believe if we remain\r\nby the ship we shall all be able to gain the shore in safety.\"  The\r\nFrenchmen, however, did not understand him, and were engaged in\r\nlaunching the remaining boats.  He felt sure that in the raging seas\r\nwhich surrounded the ship no boats would live.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever happens, we will remain on board,\" he said to Harry and David.\r\n\"The ship I know is strong, and will hold together till the storm is\r\nabated.  Those who attempt to embark now will, I fear, lose their\r\nlives.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain he urged the Frenchmen to remain.  The English captain alone,\r\nwith one of his officers, agreed that he was right.  The boats were\r\nlowered and the infatuated men leaped into them.  Pierre Lamont had\r\ncourageously remained on deck during the hurricane, but he now seemed\r\ninclined to follow his countrymen into the boats.  Harry and David saw\r\nhim, and shouted to him not to go.  Hearing them he turned back, but one\r\nof the Frenchmen seized him by the arms, and before he could disengage\r\nhimself, had dragged him into the boat.  Scarcely, however, had the\r\nboats shoved off, crowded with human beings, than first one, then the\r\nother, was capsized, and all were thrown into the water.  In vain the\r\nshrieking wretches attempted to regain the ship; some clung to the\r\nboats; a few who could swim struggled for some time amid the foaming\r\nwaves.  Captain Rymer had before this gone below, but Captain Williams\r\nand those who remained on deck, got ropes ready to throw to any who\r\nmight be washed near the ship.  None were so fortunate, and one by one\r\nthey were carried far away, and disappeared amid the foaming breakers.\r\n\r\n\"Is there not one who can be saved?\" exclaimed David, who had stood\r\nwatching the scene with horror.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, I see one clinging to the wreck of our masts,\" answered\r\nHarry; \"I must go and try to rescue him.  I do believe that it is\r\nPierre!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, let me go then,\" said David; \"I can swim better than you, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a case for scrambling rather than for swimming,\" answered\r\nHarry; \"I'll fasten a rope round my waist, and we'll have him quickly on\r\nboard.\"\r\n\r\nHarry, before David could offer another objection, did as he proposed.\r\nIt was an undertaking, however, of the greatest danger, and the utmost\r\nactivity and vigilance could alone have saved him from being struck by\r\nthe broken spars which were dashed here and there by the seas.\r\n\r\nAt length Harry reached the object of his search.  Pierre looked up at\r\nhim eagerly.  \"Oh, save me, save me!  I cannot hold on longer,\" he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\nHarry sprang forward and grasped the French boy by the collar just as\r\nhis hands relaxed their hold.  He dragged him up on the mast.  To return\r\nwith him was even more difficult than the first part of the undertaking.\r\nUndaunted, however, Harry persevered, and, though more than once almost\r\nlosing his footing, succeeded at length in bringing young Pierre on\r\nboard.  \"Brave garcon!\" exclaimed Jacques, as he helped him up; \"oh, I\r\nwould die for you!  I will be ever your friend.\"\r\n\r\nExcept the lieutenant in command, and honest Jacques Rossillion, no\r\nFrenchman remained on board, and the ship was once more, therefore, in\r\npossession of the English.  Scarcely had this fearful catastrophe\r\noccurred than the weather gave evident signs of improving.  Captain\r\nWilliams, the English commander, accompanied by Captain Rymer, went\r\nround the ship below and brought back a satisfactory report that she\r\nappeared to have suffered very little damage by the blows she had\r\nreceived.  The shore was, however, not particularly inviting; a few\r\ngroups of cocoa-nut trees and other tropical plants were alone to be\r\nseen.  It was an island scarcely more than two miles in circumference,\r\none of those spots known as keys in the West Indies; still, should the\r\nship break up, it would afford them shelter, and they could not help\r\nlonging to be able to reach the beach.  As the boats and all had been\r\nlost, this could not be done till a raft had been built.  The gentlemen\r\nimmediately set about constructing one.  As the spars had all been\r\nwashed away, it was necessary first to get those which floated alongside\r\nfrom the rigging.  There were planks also below; these were got up, with\r\nall the empty casks which could be collected.  By knocking away some of\r\nthe bulwarks, and by bringing on deck a few of the seamen's chests, they\r\nsoon had materials for constructing a raft large enough for carrying the\r\nwhole party.  All hands worked with a will.  The French lieutenant was\r\nvery active, and seemed in no way put out by having the tables so\r\ncompletely turned upon him.  He was probably grateful, as he ought to\r\nhave been, for having escaped with his life.  By the time the raft was\r\nfinished, the sea had so completely gone down that there was little\r\ndifficulty in launching it.  The bulwarks having been already completely\r\nwashed away, all that was necessary was to let it slip quietly\r\noverboard.  Its constructors gave a cheer as they saw it floating calmly\r\nalongside; they had still, however, to rig the mast and sail, as well as\r\nto fit some oars to guide it towards the shore.\r\n\r\nWhen this was done, the captains invited all the passengers up on deck.\r\nIt was agreed that it would be safer to convey only half at a time.\r\nHarry and David begged that they might accompany Captain Rymer and Mary.\r\nCaptain Rymer agreed to let Captain Williams conduct the first party,\r\nsaying that he should be content to remain on board till the return of\r\nthe raft.  Before the raft left the side, a supply of provisions were\r\nlowered down upon it; and, with the prayers of those who remained on\r\nboard for its safe voyage, the raft shoved off from the side of the\r\nship.  Its progress was slow, for there was very little wind, and there\r\nseemed to be a current sweeping round the island which took it out of\r\nits direct course.  At length, however, it reached the beach, and those\r\non it leaped out and ran eagerly up on to the dry land.  The men had,\r\nhowever, to return for the provisions, which were landed in safety.\r\nThen Captain Williams, and two seamen who accompanied him, had to return\r\nto the ship; they were a considerable time, and it seemed doubtful\r\nindeed, in consequence of the current which had to be encountered,\r\nwhether they would regain her.  They succeeded, however, at last.\r\n\r\nCaptain Rymer, with those who had remained on board, had employed their\r\ntime in getting up provisions, and their first care was to load her with\r\nas large a supply as she could safely carry; this done, the remainder of\r\nthose on board now made for the shore, which by some exertion they\r\nsafely reached.  The first care of the shipwrecked party on reaching the\r\nshore was to send out some of their number in search for water.  Captain\r\nRymer had brought some from the wreck, but this was only sufficient to\r\nlast for a short time, and their lives might depend upon their obtaining\r\na supply.  Only those who have felt the want of water know how to\r\nappreciate its value.  Others, in the meantime, employed themselves in\r\ngetting up a tent for the ladies; for which purpose they had brought\r\nsome spare sails and ropes.  In a short time the party which had gone\r\nout in search of water returned with the report that none was to be\r\nfound.  This rendered it important to economise their slender store, and\r\nto procure a future supply from the ship as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAll this time no one seemed to have thought of the French privateer.\r\nShe had not been seen since the commencement of the hurricane, from\r\nwhich, if she had escaped, it was too probable she would come and look\r\nfor her prize.  This was a source of anxiety to Captain Rymer, for,\r\nthough of course anxious to escape from their present position, he had\r\nno wish at all to fall again into the hands of the French.\r\n\r\nThe men of the party found ample occupation for the rest of the day, in\r\nputting up shelter for themselves, for hot as is the climate of the West\r\nIndies, it is dangerous to sleep exposed to the night dews.\r\n\r\nPierre seemed anxious to make himself useful, and begged that he might\r\nbe allowed to attend on the ladies.  Jacques offered to undertake the\r\noffice of cook, the duties of which he was far better able to perform\r\nthan any of the English.  The French lieutenant seemed the most\r\ncast-down of any of the party.  He sat by himself not speaking to any\r\none, and with an air of discontent, put away the food which was brought\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\"The poor lieutenant mourns and seems very unhappy,\" said David to\r\nPierre.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Pierre, \"he is often thus morose when anything annoys\r\nhim; the poor man has no religion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he not a Roman Catholic?\" asked David.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; a large number of my countrymen threw off all religion at the\r\nRevolution, and many, like him, have not taken to any since.  He, I am\r\nafraid, does not believe in God, or in any future state, but that when\r\nhe dies he will become just like a dog or a pig; so, you see, he has no\r\nhope, and nothing to keep him up.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what are you, Pierre? are you not a Roman Catholic?\" asked David.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, I am a Protestant,\" answered Pierre; \"there are a great many\r\nProtestants in France, and though some few at the Revolution became\r\ninfidels, by far the greater number remained firm to the true faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know there were any Protestants in France,\" said Harry, who,\r\nlike many boys at that time, fancied that the English were the only\r\nProtestant people in Europe.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, there are a great number who are known as Huguenots, and who\r\nfought bravely for the Protestant faith,\" said Pierre.  \"My father was\r\nof a Huguenot family, and many of his ancestors lost their lives for the\r\nlove they bore the Bible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that was a noble cause to die for,\" remarked David.  \"How sad to\r\nthink that people should reject the truths it contains.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation took place as the boys were sitting together in front\r\nof the tent.  Darkness now came rapidly on, but from the look of the\r\nweather there seemed every prospect of their having the blessing of a\r\nquiet night.  The sea had gone completely down, and the moon shone forth\r\nover the calm waters, the light just falling upon the spot where the\r\nwreck lay, so that any object could be seen approaching it.  Captain\r\nRymer and Captain Williams agreed, however to keep watch for the\r\nprotection of their charges.  Three English seamen, with the mate,\r\nwisely remained by their captain.  There were, besides Captain Rymer,\r\nfour gentlemen passengers, West Indian planters, going out to their\r\nproperty.  They were not men of much individual character, evidently\r\nmore accustomed to look after their own creature comforts than to\r\ntrouble them selves about their fellow-beings.  There was one subject in\r\nwhich they were all agreed, that the emancipation of the negroes would\r\nruin them, and all persons concerned.  It was a doubtful matter whether\r\nnegroes had souls, and that to attempt to educate them was a work of the\r\ngreatest folly.  In this matter Captain Rymer did not agree with them,\r\nand the discussion of the subject afforded them abundant supply of\r\nconversation at all times.\r\n\r\nThe night passed quietly away.  As soon as it was dawn, Captain Rymer\r\nurged Captain Williams to return at once to the wreck, and bring on\r\nshore a further supply of provisions and water.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot tell what may occur,\" he observed.  \"The hurricane season is\r\nnot yet over, and should another hurricane come on, and the vessel go to\r\npieces, we might be starved, and die for want of water.\"\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of this advice was so evident, that the raft was immediately\r\ndespatched, under the captain's charge, to bring off the cargo.  In a\r\nshort time it returned, and a message was delivered from the captain,\r\nthat he thought it would be wiser to build another raft, in order more\r\nrapidly to get the stores on shore.  This work occupied the men the\r\nwhole of the day.  Jacques alone remained on shore to cook the\r\nprovisions, with the help of Pierre, while David and Harry begged that\r\nthey might be allowed to go off to the wreck, where they thought that\r\nthey could make themselves useful.\r\n\r\n\"I vote that we make a small raft for ourselves,\" said Harry; \"and I\r\nthink that we can paddle her backwards and forwards several times, while\r\nthe big raft is only making one voyage.\"\r\n\r\nWith the experience they had already attained, they soon carried their\r\nplan into execution, and in a short time conveyed a considerable\r\nquantity of the stores on shore.  During their last trip, however, Harry\r\nobserved close alongside the raft a black fin, and a wicked pair of eyes\r\nglancing up at him.\r\n\r\n\"There's a brute of a shark,\" he exclaimed; \"he thinks he's going to get\r\na meal off one of us, I suspect.\"\r\n\r\nStill they kept paddling on, and the shark did not attempt to come\r\nnearer them.  They were not sorry, however, when they reached the shore,\r\nand Captain Rymer told them that he considered they had done enough for\r\nthe day.  It must be owned it was far pleasanter to sit near Mary, and\r\nlisten to the account of all their friends at home.  She did not tell\r\nthem how completely they had been given up, for she knew it would make\r\nHarry especially melancholy to think of the sorrow his supposed loss had\r\ncaused his mother, nor did she tell him how very sorry she herself had\r\nbeen.  Indeed, she could say truly that many of their friends fully\r\nexpected that they would turn up at last.\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't this put you in mind of our picnic?\" said Harry, looking up at\r\nher, \"though to be sure we are somewhat changed since then,\" looking\r\ndown on his tarred and dirty dress.  \"I really think the next time I go\r\non board the wreck I must try and find a new suit of clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do look rather disreputable,\" said Mary, laughing, \"for an officer\r\nin His Majesty's service.  Here comes Jacques with the dinner.  Really\r\nJacques must be a first-rate cook, and we ought to be thankful that he\r\nescaped.\"\r\n\r\nNone of the party seemed inclined to be out of spirits, except the\r\nlieutenant, who sat as usual by himself, and refused to take the food\r\nPierre offered him.  Had it even been otherwise, the good well-cooked\r\ndinner provided by Jacques might have put them in good humour, while\r\nthere was no lack of wine, of which the West Indian planters had laid in\r\na good store.  In the evening a further supply of provisions and water\r\nwas obtained from the wreck.  The next day was wisely occupied in the\r\nsame way, till a sufficient supply of food was landed to last for a\r\ncouple of months or more.  More than once it was discussed whether it\r\ncould be possible to get the wreck off, but it was agreed that without\r\nmore strength than they possessed it would be impossible, though, as far\r\nas could be ascertained, she had suffered no material damage.  Some of\r\nthe party thought they took a great deal of trouble for little purpose,\r\nand that it would be more easy to get the stores on shore as they were\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\"They will see the wisdom of what we have done should a hurricane come\r\non,\" said Captain Rymer, \"and I am not at all sure, from the appearance\r\nof the weather, that we shall escape one.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning the heat was intense.  The sun rose surrounded by a\r\nmass of ruddy hue, but was hidden ere long in a thick canopy of cloud.\r\nNot a breath of wind stirred the calm waters.  In the distance a sail\r\nwas seen, which had approached the island during the night.  Captain\r\nRymer had been watching her for some time through his glass.  The French\r\nlieutenant, on observing her, sprang to his feet, and eagerly asked the\r\ncaptain to let him look through the glass.\r\n\r\n\"It is the _Hirondelle_!\" he exclaimed.  \"Then she did not go down in\r\nthe last hurricane.  My captain guessed rightly that the prize was cast\r\naway on some island in this direction.  He is a sagacious man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish his sagacity had not led him to discover us,\" said Captain\r\nRymer.  \"If he lands here he may after all succeed in getting off the\r\nship.\"\r\n\r\nThis announcement caused, as may be supposed, a considerable amount of\r\nanxiety among those on the island.  While they were watching, two boats\r\nwere seen to leave the schooner.  Hitherto it had been so calm that a\r\nfeather held up would have fallen to the ground.  Suddenly, however,\r\nthere came a low moaning sound, and the leaves of the palm trees began\r\nto rustle strangely.  In an instant afterwards the blast swept over the\r\nisland, snapping off the tops of many of the tallest trees.  The tents\r\nwere blown down, and it was with difficulty that those on the island\r\ncould avoid being carried away.  The sea, hitherto so calm, came dashing\r\nin huge foaming billows against the weather side, and breaking over the\r\nwreck with tremendous force, and it seemed scarcely possible that she\r\ncould resist the blows that she was receiving.  Now one sea and now\r\nanother dashed against her, till she seemed to be completely covered\r\nwith a mass of foam.  They looked out for the schooner, she was nowhere\r\nto be seen.  Either she had gone down, or had been driven far away by\r\nthe hurricane.  The hurricane continued blowing without cessation; now\r\ncoming from one quarter, and now from another.\r\n\r\nEvening was approaching, and an unusual darkness overspread the ocean.\r\nIt was fearful to contemplate what might be the fate of many of those\r\nwho floated on that stormy sea.  It was impossible to put up any shelter\r\nfor the ladies, but Mary felt that she had her father to protect her,\r\nwho sat by her side, sheltering her as well as he could, aided by Harry\r\nand David.  Thus the night passed away, the whole party sitting grouped\r\ntogether for mutual protection.  \"What could have become of the\r\nschooner?\" was a question often asked and answered.  The morning broke\r\nat length.  The _Cerberus_ had disappeared, but still further off, at\r\nthe end of the reef, an object was seen.  It was part of a wreck; there\r\nwere human beings clinging to it.  \"Whether Englishmen or Frenchman we\r\nmust endeavour to save them,\" said Captain Rymer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE RESCUE OF THE FRENCH SEAMEN--MARY A PRISONER TO THE FRENCH--PIERRE\r\nDELIVERS HER--BAD CONDUCT OF THE FRENCH.\r\n\r\nThe hurricane had given signs of abating, but the sea was still far too\r\nrough to allow of even a good boat going off to the people on the reef;\r\nstill more impossible would it have been to have reached them by means\r\nof a raft.  On examining the rafts which had been constructed to bring\r\nthe cargo on shore, both were found to have suffered by the hurricane.\r\nIt was determined, therefore, to build a smaller and more manageable\r\none, by means of which it was hoped to reach the shipwrecked people.\r\nThis work Captain Williams and his companions immediately set about\r\nperforming.  The French lieutenant now thoroughly aroused, lent his hand\r\nto it.  In the course of a couple of hours a structure was formed with\r\nwhich it was hoped they might venture out to sea.\r\n\r\nTheir next undertaking was to cut out a number mast, and fit a sail for\r\nthe raft.  Still the sea would not allow them to venture from the shore;\r\nthey had, therefore, to wait patiently, watching in the meantime the\r\npeople whom they were anxious to rescue.  The wreck seemed to be fixed\r\nfirmly at the end of a reef, and to have afforded them a shelter from\r\nthe fury of the seas, which would otherwise have washed them away.\r\nStill, as they probably had no food nor water, it was impossible that\r\nthey could exist there for any length of time.  Should any attempt be\r\nmade by those on the wreck to reach the shore by swimming, it was but\r\ntoo probable that they would be carried off by the sharks, numbers of\r\nwhich swarmed around the island.  In the meantime, the men were employed\r\nin getting up the tent, and in restoring matters to the condition they\r\nwere in before the hurricane.\r\n\r\nThe poor ladies had suffered greatly from the alarm into which they had\r\nbeen thrown, and it was necessary they should obtain that rest which had\r\nbeen denied them during the night.  Mary, however, kept up her spirits,\r\nand could not help expressing her thankfulness that Harry and David had\r\nbeen saved, and were thus sharing with her the adventures which she was\r\nnot likely to forget to the end of her days.\r\n\r\n\"How curious it will be when they hear about us at home,\" said David,\r\n\"and that we were all wrecked together on this out-of-the-way island.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how are they to hear about us?\" observed Mary; \"we must get away\r\nfrom this before we can send a letter home, and how we are to get away\r\nseems the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some means will turn up, depend upon it,\" said Harry, \"we shall be seen\r\nby some passing ship, or if not, we must build a boat and try to reach\r\nsome of the nearest islands.  We are not likely to have to spend all our\r\nlives here, depend on that.\"\r\n\r\nThey little thought of the difficulties and dangers they had still to go\r\nthrough.  The day was advancing, but still the sea was considered too\r\nrough to allow the raft to be launched.  They watched the people on the\r\nreef, who seemed to be clustering together, and who probably, unless\r\nthey had a telescope, would not be aware that there were any people on\r\nthe shore likely to come to their assistance.  At length the sun set,\r\nand very unwillingly they were obliged to abandon the hope of going off\r\ntill the following morning.  They anxiously watched the weather during\r\nthe night, and were thankful to find that the wind had dropped to a\r\nperfect calm.  By daybreak Captain Williams summoned those who had\r\nagreed to accompany him, consisting of his mate and two English seamen,\r\nand Jacques Rossillion.  By means of the long sweeps, which had been\r\ncarefully fitted to the raft, they were enabled to urge it along at a\r\ngood speed over the waters.\r\n\r\n\"Success attend your efforts!\" said Captain Rymer, as he assisted in\r\nshoving off the raft.  Harry and David begged that they might also go,\r\nand assist in working the sweeps; and their offer was accepted.  They\r\nhad a somewhat long voyage to perform, and though they vigorously worked\r\nthe sweeps they could not move the raft more than at the rate of three\r\nmiles an hour.  As they approached the reef they were perceived by the\r\nshipwrecked party, who waved to them as if urging them to come faster.\r\nAs they drew near the men pointed to their mouths, indicating that they\r\nwere suffering from thirst.  Unhappily, no water had been brought off.\r\nSeveral, it appeared, had been in a state of delirium, and it was very\r\nevident that it would be dangerous to approach too close to the wreck,\r\nlest a number jumping upon the raft might upset it.  There appeared to\r\nbe about twenty or thirty people on the wreck, and Captain Williams\r\nagreed that it would not be safe to convey more than eight or ten at a\r\ntime to the shore.  The French lieutenant recognised the men as\r\nbelonging to the schooner's crew, and he called out to them by name,\r\nordering eight at a time to come down, and that they would be taken on\r\nboard.  They did not seem, however, inclined to obey him.  Fortunately,\r\nCaptain Williams had stuck a brace of pistols in his belt, and he now\r\nthreatened to shoot any who might attempt to come on board the raft\r\nunless ordered by the lieutenant.  This had the effect of keeping back\r\nthe greater number, and eight of the Frenchmen were safely got on board\r\nthe raft, which now at once commenced its return to the shore.  Those\r\nwho remained on the reef entreated that they might not be deserted,\r\nthough they would scarcely believe the promise made by their officer\r\nthat he would return for them.  The poor men who had been rescued showed\r\nhow much they had been suffering by pointing to their parched tongues,\r\nand again and again asking for water.\r\n\r\nCaptain Williams and his companions exerted themselves to the utmost to\r\nreach the shore.  This they at length accomplished, and water was\r\nimmediately procured for the thirsty men.  Their sufferings might be\r\nthose of the whole party, unless great economy was used in distributing\r\nthe precious fluid.  A small cask was put on the raft, with some cups,\r\nand once more the party set forth to return to the reef, leaving those\r\nwho had first landed to the care of their friends on shore.  As the raft\r\nagain approached the reef, the poor wretches who had been left upon it\r\nwere seen stretching out their hands eagerly for water.  There was still\r\ngreat danger lest they might rush down, in their anxiety to obtain it,\r\nand either fall into the water or upset the raft.  Much caution was\r\ntherefore necessary.  The lieutenant and Jacques first leaped on to the\r\nrock, when Captain Williams handed them up the cups of water; but the\r\nfirst man who got the cup refused to let it leave his lips till he had\r\ndrained every drop.  Two were seen to fall backward after they had\r\ndrunk, and it was with difficulty they were saved from falling into the\r\nsea.  Several who were already in a state of delirium, scarcely seemed\r\nto value the boon which had been brought them.  In time, however, water\r\nwas given to all, and it was now necessary to select those who might be\r\ncarried away on the raft, as it would require another trip before all\r\ncould be removed.  Harry and David looked somewhat anxiously for the\r\nFrench captain, but neither he nor any of the officers were among those\r\nsaved.  More than half of the crew, it was evident, had been lost.  The\r\nlieutenant did not ask questions; indeed the poor men were not in a\r\ncondition to have replied to them.\r\n\r\nFor the safety of the raft it was necessary to secure the limbs of those\r\nwho were in a state of delirium, and it was painful to see them\r\nstruggling, as they lay on the raft, not understanding that this was\r\ndone for their own safety.  The second party were thus landed safely,\r\nand again the raft put off for the remainder of the crew.  They had to\r\nrow the whole way; indeed it was fortunate that there was no wind, as it\r\nwould have made the approach to the reef much more dangerous.  As it\r\nwas, during the last trip the raft was very nearly driven against the\r\nrocks by one of those sudden upheavings of the ocean which sometimes\r\noccur, and send the water breaking over any opposing obstacle.  Happily,\r\nthey were able to shove off in time.\r\n\r\nAltogether, nearly thirty people were safely landed.  It became,\r\nhowever, a serious consideration to the former occupants of the island,\r\nhow the new comers were to be fed.  They had provisions which might have\r\nlasted them a couple of months or more, though they had already seen the\r\nnecessity of going upon an allowance of water; their numbers were now\r\ndoubled, and they had not water to last them more than a very short\r\ntime.  Still, disregarding the character of those who had been rescued,\r\nthey did their utmost to restore the poor men who had been thrown upon\r\ntheir care.  Two of them, however, died from having drunk a large\r\nquantity of salt water, and others remained seriously ill for several\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe excitement of going off on the raft having subsided, the French\r\nlieutenant again sunk into his former moody state.  At length the\r\nFrenchmen appeared to have recovered, but they did not seem inclined to\r\nassociate with the English, nor with Jacques nor Pierre, who continued\r\nto perform their former duties.  Captain Rymer and Captain Williams\r\nagreed that it would be necessary to put a guard over their provisions\r\nand stores, lest the Frenchmen should take it into their heads to help\r\nthemselves without leave.  It was explained to them that they must be\r\ncontent with a very moderate amount of food, and a still smaller\r\nquantity of water, unless a supply of the latter could be found.  They\r\nseemingly acquiesced in the wisdom of this, but from the looks they\r\nexchanged with each other, it was but too probable that they would be\r\ntempted to break through the regulations which had been formed on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nWith regard to food, they might obtain sufficient to support life both\r\nfrom the shell-fish on the shore, and from any fish they might catch,\r\nwhile the trees promised to afford them a supply of cocoanuts.  But\r\nwater was what they most required; without that it would be impossible\r\nto support existence.  As long, however, as they were supplied with\r\nfood, the Frenchmen did not show any inclination to search for it for\r\nthemselves.  Pierre was sent to tell them that lines would be provided\r\nfor them, if they would try to catch some fish, and again the captain\r\nset out to make a fresh search for water.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Frenchmen had recovered, they showed a very different\r\ndisposition to what they had previously exhibited.  They then received\r\nthe food given to them by the English with apparent gratitude.  Now,\r\nhowever, when it was sent to them they seized it rudely, and grumbled\r\nbecause the supply was not larger.  Captain Rymer endeavoured to explain\r\nto the French lieutenant that the arrangements made were for the good of\r\nall.  He, however, either had no authority over his countrymen or\r\npretended to have none.  Still, as he associated himself with them, it\r\nwas evident that he intended to side with them whatever they might do.\r\nThis state of things gave considerable anxiety to the English officers.\r\nIt was arranged that a strict guard should be kept over the provisions\r\nand water, and that no one should be allowed to take anything from the\r\nstores.\r\n\r\nPierre continued, as before, to attend on the English, though he\r\noccasionally paid a visit to the French, who were encamped at some\r\nlittle distance, and out of sight of the rest of the party.  On being\r\nquestioned, he said that the French claimed the stores as their own,\r\nbecause they had captured the vessel from which they were taken, and\r\nthat they were very angry at the idea of the English appropriating them.\r\nIt was agreed, however, that unless they were preserved as before, the\r\nFrench sailors would probably consume the whole in a very short time,\r\nand all the party would be left in a state of starvation.  Still, as the\r\nFrench had hitherto shown no disposition to annoy the English, the\r\npassengers continued to stroll about the shore of the island without any\r\napprehension, as they had been accustomed to do.  Harry and David\r\nfrequently escorted Mary in these expeditions.  They always returned\r\nwith a basket-full of shell-fish of various sorts.  The boys also fitted\r\nsome fishing lines, and after a little practice they succeeded in\r\ncatching a great many fish.  Some of them were very beautiful; but when\r\nthey showed them to Jacques, he told them that they were not fit to be\r\neaten.  Others, however, were excellent, and they had thus no\r\napprehension with regard to not having provisions for their support,\r\neven though they might remain on the island for many months.  The great\r\nanxiety was with regard to water.\r\n\r\nOne day Mary and her young companions had gone along the shore for a\r\nconsiderable distance, when they reached a point of rock upon which they\r\nbelieved that they should be able to catch a number of fish.  Mary did\r\nnot take the same interest in the sport that they did, but preferred\r\nwandering along the beach and picking up the beautiful shells, and\r\nseveral curious creatures that had been cast on shore.  Harry and David\r\nsoon began to catch a number of fish, and were completely absorbed in\r\ntheir sport.  Mary said that she would go along the beach some little\r\ndistance, and then return to them.  They saw her walking along, now\r\nstooping down to pick up a shell, now continuing her course close to the\r\nwater, when a rock hid her from view.  Just at that moment the fish\r\nbegan to bite faster and faster, and as they hauled them up in their\r\neagerness they forgot to look out for their companion.  Suddenly Harry\r\nexclaimed, \"What can have become of Mary?  She is a long time away.\"\r\n\r\nThey both shouted her name, but there was no answer.  Gathering up their\r\nlines and their fish they leaped off the rock, and ran along the beach\r\nin the direction she had gone.  They did not, however, see her, and\r\nbecame greatly alarmed.  In vain they shouted her name.\r\n\r\n\"She certainly could not have turned back and gone the other way,\" said\r\nPhilip; \"besides, see, here are the marks of her feet on the sand; she\r\nmust have gone on further than she intended.\"  They traced her by the\r\nmarks of her feet in the sand for a considerable distance, when she\r\nappeared to have turned inland, away from the beach.  \"Surely here are\r\nthe marks of other feet,\" said David; \"if there were any savages on the\r\nisland, I should be afraid she had been carried off by them.\"\r\n\r\nThey now pursued in the direction of the marks of the feet, though\r\nMary's were no longer to be traced.  The ground in the centre of the\r\nisland being hard, they here lost all traces.  They looked round in\r\nevery direction.  No persons were to be seen.  They continued running\r\neagerly forward, shouting again and again Mary's name, when they found\r\nthemselves in front of the French camp.  The French jeered at them as\r\nthey passed, and as they were unable to speak French, they could not\r\nenquire if any of the people had seen Mary.  Not knowing what else to\r\ndo, they hurried back to their own friends with the bad news.  Captain\r\nRymer at first would scarcely credit the account they gave him.  He\r\nhowever, with the two boys and Captain Williams, immediately set out to\r\nsearch the neighbourhood of the spot where Mary had disappeared.  It was\r\nevident to them that she had not been carried away from the island; they\r\ntherefore came to the conclusion that the Frenchmen had made her a\r\nprisoner, in the hopes that they might thus compel the English to agree\r\nto any terms they might propose.\r\n\r\nCaptain Rymer therefore determined to go to the French with Pierre as\r\ninterpreter, and to ascertain what terms the French had to propose.  At\r\nfirst they denied that she was with them, but said that they were\r\ndetermined to have one half of the provisions and water as their proper\r\nshare.  Captain Rymer replied that they were determined for the good of\r\nall those on the island not to give up the provisions, and again\r\nenquired whether they had seen his young daughter, but could get no\r\nanswer in return; and doubting whether the French really knew anything\r\nabout Mary, he returned to consult further with Captain Williams.  It\r\nwas agreed that, should they yield to the demands of the Frenchmen, as\r\nsoon as the first half of the provisions were consumed they would demand\r\nthe remainder, and that, therefore, it would be wiser at once to refuse\r\ntheir demands.\r\n\r\nThe day was drawing on, but still there were no signs of Mary.  They\r\narranged that Jacques should carry their food as usual to the French,\r\nand endeavour to obtain all the information that he could.  Harry and\r\nDavid offered to go and watch in the neighbourhood of the camp, so that\r\nif she really was there, and could make her escape, they might be ready\r\nto assist her.  While they remained concealed, Pierre went on into the\r\ncamp.  He brought a larger supply of food than usual to each man, and\r\ntalked to one and then to the other, often in no complimentary terms of\r\nthe English.\r\n\r\n\"And why do you remain with them?\" was the question put to him.\r\n\r\n\"Because I am well fed; and until you came I had none else to associate\r\nwith except Jacques, and I cannot make out whether he likes the English\r\nor our own countrymen the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then do you intend to remain with us now?\" was the question put to\r\nPierre.\r\n\r\n\"O yes!  I have had enough of the English, and wish to throw in my\r\nfortunes with my own countrymen.\"\r\n\r\nThe Frenchmen seemed to think that Pierre was in earnest, as he showed\r\nno inclination to leave them.  He was, however, very busy in going about\r\namong the huts, whilst he put several questions to his countrymen, as to\r\nwhether they could guess anything about the little girl who had been\r\ncarried off.  \"Our lieutenant knows something about that, and as he does\r\nnot want to fight with the English, hopes to gain his object by\r\ndiplomacy.\"\r\n\r\nThis convinced Pierre that Mary was in the camp, and he determined to\r\nset her free if he could.  There was a hut in a grove close to the camp,\r\ninto which he had hitherto not looked, and he thought it very likely\r\nthat Mary had been shut up there.  He knew, however, that he should be\r\nwatched, especially by the lieutenant, who was walking up and down on\r\nthe beach, in his usual moody manner.  Nothing could be done, at all\r\nevents, until it was dark; and he therefore continued laughing and\r\ntalking with his countrymen, so as if possible to throw them off their\r\nguard.  He observed the lieutenant once visit the hut with a tin of\r\nfood, and, on leaving it, he placed a log of wood across the door.  This\r\nconvinced him more even than before that Mary was shut up there.\r\n\r\nNight came on at last.  By the conversation of the Frenchmen, he feared\r\nthat they had determined to have possession of the provisions by force,\r\nif they could not gain them in any other way.  The Frenchmen amused\r\nthemselves as their countrymen, even under the most adverse\r\ncircumstances, are accustomed to do, by singing, telling stories, and\r\noccasionally getting up and dancing.  At last, tired with their\r\nexertions, they laid themselves down in their huts.  Pierre waited until\r\nthey all seemed asleep.  He most dreaded being detected by the\r\nlieutenant.  He crept cautiously near the hut in which he was lying\r\ndown, and, greatly to his satisfaction, found that he also was asleep.\r\nHe instantly stole off to the hut in which he believed Mary was\r\nconfined.  The log at the entrance was somewhat heavy, and he had no\r\nlittle difficulty in removing it without making a noise.  He pushed back\r\nthe rough planks that formed the door, and there, to his infinite\r\nsatisfaction, he saw Mary.  She was seated on a heap of boughs in a\r\ncorner of the hut, with her hands tied together, and her feet secured to\r\na log.  She uttered an exclamation of surprise on hearing Pierre\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" he said, \"make no noise, I have come to release you.\"\r\n\r\nHe fortunately had the knife in his pocket that David had given him, and\r\nwith this he quickly cut the ropes with which the little girl was bound.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said, \"take my hand, and I will lead you to those with whom\r\nyou will soon find your way back to your friends.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, he took her hand and led her through the grove, the French\r\ncamp soon being lost sight of.  They quickly found the spot where Harry\r\nand David were waiting.  The boys were delighted at finding their young\r\ncompanion, and hurried off, supporting her between them, to their\r\nfriends, while Pierre returned to the French.  Captain Rymer was\r\noverjoyed at seeing his daughter, as will be supposed.  The English did\r\nnot rest much that night, not knowing what the French would next do.  It\r\nwas nearly morning when a footstep was heard approaching the camp, and\r\nPierre came running up.  \"My countrymen have determined to attack you,\r\nand take the provisions by force,\" he said; \"I had just time to escape,\r\nfor they already suspected me of assisting Miss Rymer to escape.\"\r\n\r\nJacques, who had remained with the English, was very sorry to hear what\r\nthe French proposed doing; he promised, however, to fight on the side of\r\nhis friends.  Ten muskets, and a small supply of powder and ball, had\r\nbeen brought from the wreck.  Of these the Frenchman were not aware, but\r\nas there was very little ammunition, it would soon be exhausted, and\r\nthen numbers would prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nTHE ARRIVAL OF THE \"ARETHUSA\"--THE FRENCH TAKEN PRISONERS--DAVID BECOMES\r\nA MIDSHIPMAN--THE FIGHT AND VICTORY--JOY AT HOME--THE END.\r\n\r\nCaptain Rymer had taken the precaution of throwing up a breastwork round\r\nthe camp, which might assist him in repelling any attack of the\r\nFrenchmen.  \"Though my countrymen will kill me if they discover I have\r\nwarned you, I would rather die than that you should be taken by\r\nsurprise,\" exclaimed Pierre, as he was helped over the parapet.\r\n\r\n\"We hope that we shall be able to protect you,\" said Harry, who with\r\nDavid had been on guard some time.\r\n\r\n\"Never fear; we have firearms, and your countrymen are without them.  If\r\nthey come, they will receive a warmer reception than they expect.\"\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterwards a number of persons were seen stealing towards\r\nthe camp, and evidently hoping to take the company by surprise.\r\n\"Silence!\" said Captain Rymer to his companions, \"we will let them\r\nsuppose that we are asleep, and then, if we suddenly start up and fire a\r\nmusket or two over their heads they will become so alarmed that they\r\nwill perhaps desist from the attack.\"  This plan was followed out.  The\r\nFrenchmen were evidently somewhat startled at finding that those they\r\nhad come to attack were better armed than themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Pierre, tell them that if they come on many of them will be\r\nkilled,\" said Captain Rymer; \"we don't wish to injure them, but we are\r\nresolved not to yield to their demand.\"\r\n\r\nThe Frenchmen hearing this at first seemed to hesitate, but shouting to\r\neach other they again advanced towards the embankment.  \"You will take\r\nthe consequences of your folly,\" said Captain Rymer, and Pierre\r\ninterpreted what he said.  Several shots were fired, and two or three of\r\nthe Frenchmen were apparently hit.  The discharge had the effect of\r\nmaking them retreat.  It was evident, however, that from the few muskets\r\nthat had gone off that the powder was far from good, and that little\r\ndependence could therefore be placed on their firearms.  Still it\r\nappeared that the French had had enough for the moment, as having failed\r\nin their expected surprise of the English they retreated once more to\r\ntheir own camp.  But the state of affairs was very serious, as it could\r\nnot be supposed that they would not again attempt to attack the camp.\r\n\r\n\"One thing must be done,\" observed Captain Rymer; \"as soon as the sun\r\ncomes out we must dry our powder, that it may prove of more use than it\r\ndid just now.\"  In a short time daylight broke, and the sun, rising out\r\nof the ocean, shed a bright light over the scene.  As he rose, his rays\r\nfell on the white sails of a ship, not two miles from the island.\r\nCaptain Rymer's telescope was immediately turned towards her.  \"She's an\r\nEnglish frigate,\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Let me look, sir! let me look!\" cried Harry, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"That she is, indeed, and my own ship, the _Arethusa_, I am sure she is,\r\nI should know her among fifty other frigates.  We expected that she\r\nwould be sent out to the West Indies.\"\r\n\r\nThe great point was now to draw the attention of those on board the\r\nfrigate to the island.  A flagstaff was quickly erected at a point clear\r\nof the trees, and as the flag was run up, several muskets were fired at\r\nthe same time.  They waited anxiously to see the effect.  In another\r\nminute an answering gun was fired from the frigate, and almost at the\r\nsame moment a couple of boats were seen approaching the shore.  Harry's\r\ndelight was very great when he recognised several of his shipmates in\r\nthe boats.  The second lieutenant of the frigate, who came in command,\r\nwas the first person to step on shore.  Harry, forgetting his own\r\nappearance, instantly ran up to him, and was somewhat mortified at the\r\nlook of astonishment with which the lieutenant regarded him.\r\n\r\n\"What, don't you know me, sir?\" exclaimed Harry.\r\n\r\n\"I begin to have an idea,\" said the lieutenant, putting out his hand,\r\n\"though there are one or two reasons why I should not know you.  The\r\nfirst is, that we thought you had lost the number of your mess; and,\r\nexcuse me, you certainly do not look like an English midshipman.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I don't think I do,\" said Harry, laughing.  \"Now let me\r\nintroduce my friends to you.  Here is Mr David Morton, and Captain\r\nRymer and Miss Rymer, and all these ladies and gentlemen.  And it will\r\ntake some time to tell you all about ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nHarry, in his joy, let his tongue run on, scarcely knowing what he was\r\nsaying.  Captain Rymer now stepped forward and explained the state of\r\naffairs.  This required some little time to do.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure the captain will be very glad to receive the master, crew,\r\nand all the passengers of the _Cerberus_ on board the frigate,\" replied\r\nthe lieutenant; \"but I don't know how he will be inclined to treat the\r\nFrenchmen, who have behaved as you have described.  If they are left on\r\nthe island they will probably perish of thirst.  But, in the meantime,\r\nshould any English vessel come here, they might take the crew prisoners,\r\nand make off in her.\"\r\n\r\nIt was agreed, therefore, that the best way would be to carry them off\r\nas prisoners to Jamaica.  The Frenchmen were very indignant at hearing\r\nthe arrangements that had been made, but when they saw that the boat's\r\ncrew were armed they had the sense to know that resistance was useless.\r\nHarry and David entreated that Pierre and Jacques might not be made\r\nprisoners, and of course their request was granted.  Both Jacques and\r\nPierre begged that they might enter on board the frigate.  In a short\r\ntime nearly all those who had lately been living on the island were\r\ncarried on board the frigate.  The Frenchmen were placed in the prison\r\nforward.  There was one exception, however, the French lieutenant was\r\nnowhere to be found.  While the rest of his countrymen were embarking he\r\nhad disappeared.  A boat's crew was sent on shore to search for him.\r\nThe only trace that could be discovered of him was his hat at the end of\r\na ledge of rocks, off which it was supposed he had thrown himself, and\r\nbeen drowned.  Poor man! he had given up all hopes of happiness in this\r\nlife, and had refused to believe in a life to come.\r\n\r\nIn those days it was not so difficult to enter the navy as at the\r\npresent time.  Notwithstanding all the hardships David had gone through\r\nhe was as anxious as ever to become a midshipman.  The captain promised\r\nto place him on the quarter-deck, if he preferred remaining out in the\r\nWest Indies instead of going home.  David was naturally very anxious to\r\nsee his friends; but at the same time his darling desire to enter the\r\nnavy could now be realised.  If he went home he would be separated from\r\nHarry, whom he now looked upon more than ever as a brother.\r\n\r\n\"At all events, I will remain out,\" said David, \"till I can hear from\r\nhome, and then, should my father and mother desire me to return, I must\r\nobey them.\"\r\n\r\nThe frigate conveyed Captain Rymer to his government, in the island of,\r\nand as she was constantly cruising about in that neighbourhood Harry and\r\nDavid had frequent opportunities of seeing Mary.  Those were stirring\r\ndays, and midshipmen met with various adventures.  David at length\r\nanxiously broke open a letter which reached him from home.  His father\r\nand mother expressed their gratitude to Heaven that he had escaped so\r\nmany dangers, and told him that, as his heart was set on becoming a\r\nmidshipman, they would no longer oppose his wishes.\r\n\r\nSeveral years passed by; the frigate was at one time cruising amongst\r\nthe West Indian Islands, and at another time she was sent to Halifax,\r\nthen the chief station of the American squadron.  Fully four years\r\npassed away before she was ordered home.  The command held by Captain\r\nRymer at the same time came to an end, and he and Mary prepared to\r\nreturn to England.  The _Arethusa_ sailed some little time after them.\r\nHer crew, as was too often the case, was diminished by yellow fever; but\r\nthe survivors thought only of once more reaching their native land, and\r\nlooked forward with joy at the prospect of again seeing the white cliffs\r\nof old England.  Already the frigate was more than half-way across the\r\nAtlantic, when one morning a sail was espied on the weather-bow; the\r\nsails were trimmed and the frigate gave chase.  The stranger took her\r\nfor an enemy, and did everything to escape, and not without good hopes\r\nof success, for she was evidently a fast craft.\r\n\r\nThe _Arethusa_ was, however, one of the fastest frigates in the navy,\r\nand it was not likely that the chase would succeed, unless, favoured by\r\nthe darkness, she might alter her course during the night.  A sharp\r\nlook-out was kept.  Twice the look-out man exclaimed that she was\r\nnowhere to be seen, but again she was caught sight of.  When morning\r\ndawned it was calculated that the frigate had gained considerably upon\r\nher.  The chase continued for the best part of the day.  At last the\r\nfrigate got her within length of her bow-chasers.  Several shots were\r\nfired without inducing her to haul down her colours, which were French.\r\nShe was a large schooner, a powerful vessel, with heavy masts and sails.\r\nAt length a shot carried away her main-topmast, and now, finding that\r\nany further attempt at escaping was useless, the colours were hauled\r\ndown.  She proved to be a French privateer returning home after a\r\nsuccessful cruise.  The rage of the Frenchmen was very great at finding\r\nthemselves captured, when they so soon expected to be in _La Belle\r\nFrance_ to enjoy the booty they had obtained.  In a short time, however,\r\nafter the greater number had been transferred to the deck of the\r\nfrigate, they were dancing and singing, apparently forgetful of their\r\nmisfortune.  As no lieutenant from the frigate could be spared to take\r\ncharge of the prize, Harry, who had now become an experienced officer,\r\nwas sent on board in command, and David went as his lieutenant.  Pierre\r\nbegged that he might accompany them.  For two or three days they kept in\r\nsight of the frigate, but a gale coming on, with thick weather, when\r\nmorning broke the _Arethusa_ was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"We must find our way up Channel as best we can,\" said Harry.  \"I think\r\nyou and I can manage a correct day's work, though we have not had as\r\nmuch experience in navigation as would be desirable.\"\r\n\r\nThe weather continued bad for several days, during which the schooner\r\nwas hove-to.  Once more the sky cleared; the wind moderated, and a\r\ncoarse was steered up Channel.\r\n\r\n\"I can scarcely fancy that more than four years have passed away since\r\nyou and I drifted out here in a boat with poor old Jefferies.  We return\r\nin a very different style, don't we?\" remarked Harry to his companion.\r\n\r\nThey had reached, they calculated, the chops of the Channel, when a\r\nlarge merchant ship was seen ahead.\r\n\r\n\"Should she prove to be an enemy's craft she will make a rich prize,\"\r\nsaid David.\r\n\r\n\"I rather think she is English,\" said Harry; \"but see, there is another\r\nvessel, a large lugger I make her out to be, bearing down upon her.  The\r\nlugger is French, there is no doubt about that.  I should not be\r\nsurprised if she is a privateer, about to pounce down upon the merchant\r\nvessel.  If the Frenchmen have seen us, they take us to be French also,\r\nand are anxious to secure the prize before we come up,\" observed Harry.\r\n\"I am not, however, certain that she will do that; see, there is a\r\nstrong breeze from the westward coming up, and the sails of the two\r\nvessels are already becalmed.\"\r\n\r\nHarry was right; the schooner carried up the breeze, and stood in\r\nbetween the two vessels before the lugger had time to fire a shot.\r\nInstantly hoisting English colours, Harry boldly stood towards the\r\nlugger, followed by the merchant ship.  He at once opened fire on the\r\nlugger, who made all sail to escape.  This was what Harry had determined\r\nshe should not do.  The schooner carried two long guns in her bows.\r\nThese were so well worked that after a few shots the lugger's mizen-mast\r\nwas knocked away.  The main-mast followed, and the lugger, being now\r\nreduced to an almost helpless condition, hauled down her colours.  As\r\nmay be supposed, Harry and David's delight was very great, at not only\r\nhaving made so valuable a prize, but saving a valuable merchant vessel\r\nfrom capture.  Still greater was their satisfaction when going on board\r\nthe merchant vessel, they found that Captain Rymer and Mary were amongst\r\nthe passengers.\r\n\r\nThe merchantman was bound for Falmouth, and to that port Harry also\r\nresolved to steer with the prize, as she was not in a condition to be\r\ntaken up Channel.  The next morning the three vessels anchored in\r\nFalmouth Harbour.  As neither Harry nor David could leave their vessels,\r\na messenger was despatched to their homes, and in a short time Mr and\r\nMrs Morton, Mrs Merryweather, and a considerable number of friends who\r\nformed the picnic party on that memorable day when Harry and David went\r\nadrift in a boat, were collected at the Green Bank Hotel.  If Harry had\r\nbeen looked upon as a hero on the distant day of which we speak, much\r\nmore so was he now.\r\n\r\nBoth Harry and David rose to rank and honour in the noble profession\r\nthey had selected, and as soon as the former obtained his rank as\r\npost-captain, Mary Rymer became his wife; and among the adventures he\r\nloved to describe to his young descendants, was that of how he and his\r\nfriend Admiral Morton, in their younger days, went \"Adrift in a Boat.\"\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
