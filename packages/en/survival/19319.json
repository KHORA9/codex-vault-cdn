Regarding the natural history of the bee, I have merely\r\nstated a few of the leading facts connected with that interesting\r\nsubject, drawn from Wildman's Book on Bee-management.\r\n\r\n_London, April, 1844._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I. _FIG. 1._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF THE PLATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE I, FIGURE 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nA B C D E F and E F, the oblong box as shown in fig. 1, Plate I.\r\n\r\nA B C D, the top lid of the oblong box; G H, the half of it made to fall\r\nback, and supported at an angle by the hinges, _h h_; _l_, the upper\r\npart of the lock of the box; _i k_, the two gable ends of the roof; _i_,\r\nthe perforated zinc shown as secured in a triangular frame; and _k_, the\r\noutside appearance of the ventilator.\r\n\r\nQ Q, the two quadrants, supporting the table, I J, which is formed by\r\nthe side of the box, A C E E, being let down; _a a a_, &c., fifteen\r\nholes made to receive the back bolt, _m_, of the observation-frame, Z;\r\n_b b_, two bolts to fasten into the holes, _c_ and _d_, when the table\r\nI J, is closed, _f_, being the other part of the lock.\r\n\r\nT, one of the handles of the box (the other not seen).\r\n\r\nU, one of the blocks (the other not shown) to keep the bottom of the box\r\nfrom the ground, when the four legs L L L L, are unscrewed from the four\r\ncorners of the box.\r\n\r\nX X B D, the front of the box; _e_, the alighting board, four inches\r\nwide, extending the whole length from F to F; X _2_, shows a small ledge\r\nto keep the wet from entering the bee-box, and X I, one of the slides\r\n_s_, drawn out, and extending beyond the end of the box; the other half\r\nslide, _s_, on the _left_ hand side, not drawn out in the sketch, the\r\npart under X 1, shows the opening for the ingress and egress of the bees.\r\n\r\nR, one of the two pieces of red cedar at the inside of the box, fixed at\r\nthe ends, E F.

Instead of the lid of the box being flat, it is made in the\r\nshape of the roof of a cottage, and with projecting eaves to throw\r\noff the wet more effectually. One of the long sides of the box is\r\nconstructed to open with hinges, and to hang on a level with the\r\n_bottom_ of the box, and is held up by means of two quadrants. As many\r\ngrooves, half of an inch broad, half an inch deep, and about 9-1/2\r\ninches long, are formed, 1-1/8 of an inch apart, in the inside of the\r\nbottom of the box as its length will admit.\r\n\r\nIn the other side, a long half inch slip is cut for the egress and\r\ningress of the bees, having a piece of wood about an inch thick, and\r\nfour inches wide, fastened on the outside, just under the opening, to\r\nform the alighting board for them.\r\n\r\nAt the top, of the side of the box which is made to let down, a four\r\ninch piece of mahogany the length of the inside of the box is secured\r\nin, having corresponding grooves formed, half an inch broad, 1-1/8 of an\r\ninch deep, and half an inch apart, to those made in the bottom of the\r\nbox, leaving just _twelve_ inches between the bottom grooves and the\r\nupper bar grooves.\r\n\r\nWhen the four legs are screwed into the four corners of the box, the\r\nsmall \"bee-house\" is ready for the reception of the \"bee-frames\" and\r\nthe bees. The \"bee-frames\" are made of half inch mahogany, being twelve\r\ninches high, nine inches long, and not more than half of an inch broad,\r\nso that these frames will fit into the box, sliding into fifteen grooves\r\nformed on the bottom, and kept securely in their places by the upper\r\ngrooves in the mahogany bar.\r\n\r\nWhen the fifteen, or whatever number of the bee-frames intended to be\r\nused, have been run into the grooves, sheets of perforated zinc are\r\nplaced on the tops of them; the 1-1/8 of an inch openings at the backs\r\nof the frames being closed with slips of tin.\r\n\r\nOne of the bee-frames is made solid, with sheets of zinc being fixed\r\nin it; this frame can then be used as a divider between any number of\r\nthe bee-frames, and thus form the box into two compartments, either to\r\naugment or diminish the space in the box according to the size of the\r\nswarm, or the increasing wants of the bees for more room.\r\n\r\nThe bees are then introduced into the hive (having first closed the\r\nbacks of the bee-frames with the slips of tin, and fastened the side\r\nlid of the box against them, and also removed one of the sheets of\r\nperforated zinc from the tops of the bee-frames) by dislodging the bees\r\nfrom the straw-hive in which they had been previously collected, or\r\nshaken from the boughs of the tree, where they may have settled, so as\r\nto fall upon the tops of the frames within the box; when the bees have\r\nall congregated within the bee-frames by crawling through the open\r\nspaces at the top, the perforated sheet of zinc is placed over them; the\r\nbees can then only escape through the long slip or entrance which was\r\nmade for them in the front of the box.\r\n\r\nThe top lid can be closed and locked, when the bees will be secure from\r\nthe gaze of the inquisitive, or the bad intentions of thieves.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed to give any directions for the construction of the\r\n\"bar-and-frame-hive\" I am _anxious_ to _warn_ all amateur carpenters,\r\nand those who delight to superintend the labours of a \"cheap working\r\ncountry carpenter,\" against the fatal error of using unseasoned wood;\r\nfor, unless the \"bottom board\" and the \"bee-frames\" are made of\r\nmahogany, or some well-seasoned, hard, or close-grained wood, the\r\nadvantages of the bar and frame-hive will be quite destroyed, as the\r\ngreat object is to have the bee-frames to slide in and out of the\r\ngrooves with the _greatest facility_. Throughout the whole of the making\r\nof the hive or box, no glue should be used, unless further secured with\r\nsmall SCREWS OR NAILS.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. John Milton of No. 10, Great Marylebone-street, has\r\nsome well constructed bar and frame bee-hives of various prices.]\r\n\r\nThe oblong box, A B C D, E F and E F (Plate I, fig. 1), is to be made of\r\nwell-seasoned poplar, fir, or deal, of an inch in thickness; the inside\r\ndimensions are 28 inches and 5/8 of an inch long from A to C, 10-1/2\r\ninches broad from A to B, and sixteen inches deep from A to E.\r\n\r\nThe top lid A B C D is formed in the shape of a common roof, and made\r\nto project an inch, before, behind, and at the two gable ends, like the\r\neaves of a cottage to throw off the wet.\r\n\r\nThe half of this roof G H, is made to open and fall back with hinges\r\n_h h_.\r\n\r\nThe two gable ends of the roof have holes cut in them, _i, k_, to admit\r\nthe circulation of air; and secured with perforated zinc withinside to\r\nprevent the intrusion of wasps, or any other enemies to bees; the gable\r\nmarked _i_, shows the perforated zinc framed into the gable, and _k_ the\r\noutside appearance of the ventilator.\r\n\r\nThe side of the box marked A C E E, is made to let down and form a table\r\nI J, hung on hinges P P, and supported by the quadrants Q Q, one inch\r\n_below the level of the bottom board_.\r\n\r\nTwo handles are fixed in the ends of the box, one shown in the sketch\r\nat T.\r\n\r\nTwo blocks of wood are screwed on the bottom of the box (one shown at U)\r\nto keep it off the ground, &c., when the four legs, L L L L, at the four\r\ncorners of the box are unscrewed for the convenience of packing, &c. In\r\nthe opposite side or front of the box at X X, is fixed a piece of board\r\n_e_, four inches broad, and an inch thick, extending the whole length\r\nfrom F F; this is secured at an angle with the bottom of the box, so as\r\nto form a slightly inclined plain _e_, for the alighting board, which\r\nwould be always dry for the bees to land upon. A half inch opening is\r\nmade from F to F, just above the alighting board, for the ingress and\r\negress of the bees. Slides are made _s s_, to regulate the extent of the\r\nopenings, or to entirely close the entrance to the box; these slides can\r\nbe drawn out when it is necessary to clean the bottom board, &c.\r\n\r\nWithin-side the box, two pieces of red cedar of half an inch in\r\nthickness, 12-1/8 inches long, 9-1/2 inches broad, are nailed on to\r\neach end at E F, and E F (one of the pieces of red cedar shown at R).\r\nThe quadrants, Q Q, being made to work between them and the outer case.\r\nA fillet, _v v_, is fastened on a level with the tops of the two pieces\r\nof red cedar, to form a ledge of about a 1/4 of an inch all round, to\r\nsupport the sheets of perforated zinc, as shown at W W.\r\n\r\nSixteen pieces of mahogany, 1-1/8 of an inch broad, and half an inch\r\ndeep, are to be screwed to the mahogany floor board, commencing against\r\nthe piece of red cedar, R, and leaving a space between each piece, half\r\nof an inch, and finishing against the other piece of red cedar with the\r\nlast; there will then be formed fifteen grooves, half of an inch in\r\nwidth, half an inch in depth, and 9-1/2 inches long on the floor-board\r\nas shown at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\r\n\r\nA bar of mahogany, Y Y, about two inches square, having grooves,\r\nX X X X, &c., corresponding to those on the floor-board, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\r\n6, &c., is let in, and fastened between A and C, having a clear space of\r\ntwelve inches between the floor-board, and this top bar; the object of\r\nthese grooves being to receive, and keep steadily in their places, the\r\nfifteen bee-frames, when introduced into them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. I._]\r\n\r\nThe \"bee-frames\" are made of mahogany, nine inches long, twelve inches\r\nhigh, and half an inch broad. Each frame is _dove-tailed_ to make it\r\nstrong at the angles, and to keep it true; the upper part is formed of\r\none inch mahogany, and _bevelled_ off (as the carpenters call it) to the\r\neighth of an inch, in the centre, as shown at _a_, fig. 1: on the two\r\nsides of this triangular bar, _b b_, pieces of glass, extending the\r\nlength of the bar, are fixed with red lead. The two sides of the frame,\r\n_d, d_, are to increase in size, from half an inch at the top, to 1-1/2\r\ninches at the bottom. The bottom piece, _c_, is half an inch in depth.\r\nThe back of each frame has a piece of tin, about the thickness of a\r\ncard, fixed on it, of the exact size, viz. twelve inches long, and half\r\nan inch broad, _e, e_. In the centre of the back of each frame, _f_,\r\na screw-nut is let in, which is made to fit a screw at the end of a\r\nlong spindle, S, Plate I, fig. 1. This spindle with a handle, Z, will\r\nscrew equally well into the screw-nuts of the fifteen bee-frames and\r\ndivision-frame. The use of this spindle being, to draw in and out of the\r\ngrooves the fifteen bee-frames when required. When the bee-frames have\r\nbeen put into the grooves in the box, slips of tin about thirteen inches\r\nlong, and and a half broad, are slipped into their backs (being run in\r\nbetween the backs of the bee-frames, and the pieces of thin tin fixed\r\nupon them), to close the 1-1/8 of an inch openings. And three or four\r\nsheets of perforated zinc are laid upon the tops of the bee-frames,\r\nresting on the fillets. Thus, then, when a swarm of bees has been\r\nintroduced into this box, the bees have to build their combs within\r\nthe fifteen bee-frames, or whatever number may have been run into the\r\ngrooves for that purpose. The bees cannot escape from above the frames,\r\nas the sheets of perforated zinc prevent them, nor from the 1-1/8 of an\r\ninch openings at the backs of the frames, as they have been closed with\r\nthe slips of tin; the only open part being the long narrow slip, just\r\nabove the alighting board, which was originally left for their ingress\r\nand egress.\r\n\r\nThe division-frame is made of half inch mahogany, twelve inches high,\r\n9-1/2 long, and half of an inch broad. So that it will run into any of\r\nthe grooves formed for the bee-frames; but made to fit close to the box\r\nat the end, by means of a slip of wood, C C, fig. 2, to prevent the bees\r\ncrawling between the frame and the outer-box, as they can do round the\r\nbee-frames.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. II._]\r\n\r\nThe division-frame itself is closed by having two sheets of zinc run\r\ninto it as shown in fig. 2, the one marked _b b b b_, and partly drawn\r\nout, being of solid sheet zinc; and _a a_, the other in the frame, of\r\nperforated zinc; _d_, being the screw-nut (like those in the bee-frames)\r\nby means of which it can be drawn out into the observation-frame, &c.\r\nThus, wherever this division-frame is run into the bee-box, (except of\r\ncourse at No. 1, and No. 15 grooves) it cuts off all communication with\r\nthe bee-frames on the right or left of it; and two colonies of bees may\r\nbe kept in the same box, and still have distinct frames to work upon,\r\nand separate entrances, &c.\r\n\r\nIf then bees have been put into one of the bar-and-frame-hives, and\r\nsufficient time has been given them to build their combs within \"the\r\nbee-frames,\" the frames with their contents can be drawn out into the\r\n\"observation-frame,\" (which will be more fully described) whenever it\r\nis wished to examine the bees, &c., as the 1-1/8 of an inch spaces\r\nbetween the grooves will allow of a sufficient distance to be preserved,\r\nbetween the lateral surfaces of the perpendicular combs formed in the\r\n\"bee-frames,\" and thus permit them to slide by each other with facility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. III._]\r\n\r\nThe \"observation-frame,\" fig. 3, is a mahogany frame, fourteen inches\r\nhigh, eleven inches long, and about four inches wide, having a single\r\ngroove half an inch deep, and half an inch broad, running within its\r\nwhole length of eleven inches. The two largest sides have panes of glass\r\nfixed in them with small brads. The top, bottom, and one end (this end\r\nforming the back) of this frame, are made of solid wood; the back having\r\na small hole, _f_, 2/8 of an inch in diameter in the middle, to allow\r\nthe spindle before mentioned to pass through it. The end which forms the\r\nfront of the frame is open, so that any one of the bee-frames can be run\r\ninto the observation-frame, but may be closed by a piece of tin (_d_)\r\nbeing slipt into the small grooves at _c c_. The observation-frame has\r\ntwo pins, _a, b_, to fit into the 2/8 holes made along the bottom board\r\nof the bee-box, shown by the figures, 1, 2, 3, &c., see Plate I, fig. 1,\r\nand also two small bolts _r_ and _m_; _r_, the upper one to fix into the\r\nholes above X X X, &c., in the mahogany bar; (but this bolt is only used\r\nduring the operation of drawing out the bee-frames into the observation\r\nframe); and the other bolt _m_ at the back of the frame, to fasten into\r\nthe 2/8 holes, _a, a, a_, &c., made in the lid, I J. When the two pins\r\nand the bolts of the observation-frame have been adjusted and fixed, the\r\ngroove in it will be in a straight line with one of the grooves formed\r\nin the bottom board of the box, consequently a bee-frame can be made to\r\nslide, by means of the long spindle, in and out of the box, into the\r\nobservation-frame.\r\n\r\nThe use of this \"observation frame\" must now be explained more fully:\r\nthe top lid of the bee box, Plate I, fig. 1. G. H. being thrown up,\r\nwill screen the \"operator\" from the bees, which are flying in and out\r\nin the front of the hive or box. The back lid, I. J., is let down, and\r\nsupported by the quadrants Q. Q., and forms a table, the box having been\r\nraised from the ground by the four legs, L L L L. The observation frame\r\nis placed opposite to whichever bee-frame is to be examined; the two\r\npins, _a, b_, fig. 3, running into the holes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c., made\r\nin the bottom board. The small bolts, Plate I, secured at the top, as\r\nat _r_, and the back _m_: the long spindle, S, is run through the 2/8\r\nhole in the back of the observation frame, as at Z, and the end of the\r\nspindle screwed into the screw socket _t_, at the back of the bee-frame\r\n_w_; the two pieces of tin on the right and left of the bee-frame are\r\npulled out (of course the observation frame being empty, and having the\r\npiece of tin from its front taken out), the operator holding by the\r\nhandle, _z_, of the spindle, gradually draws out the bee-frame into the\r\nobservation frame, and after examining the bees and comb, gently returns\r\nthe bee-frame into its groove in the floor-board: the two slips of\r\ntin are then replaced in the backs of the bee-frames: the spindle is\r\nunscrewed and withdrawn, the bolts are unfastened, the observation frame\r\nbeing kept firmly in its place, held by the left hand of the operator,\r\nwhilst with the right he runs in the long slip of tin, _d_, fig. 3, into\r\nthe front of the observation frame, to keep the bees (escaped from the\r\nreturned bee-frame), until the observation frame is again fixed opposite\r\nto another bee-frame, when the tin is withdrawn and the bolts fastened\r\nas before. It has been shown that by these means, each bee-frame, and\r\nthe bees and comb contained in it, can be easily drawn out and examined,\r\nwithout interfering with any other part of the hive, or occasioning the\r\nloss of a single bee.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the interior of the hive is thus open to inspection at any\r\nmoment, and a choice can be made of the combs containing the most honey,\r\nor the bee owner enabled to trace the devastation of the honey moth,\r\nand ascertain the presence of any other enemy, and this without the\r\nassistance of smoke, which must be injurious both to the bees and their\r\nbrood.\r\n\r\nWhen the bee-frame is returned and secured, the observation-frame is\r\nremoved; then the lid, I J, being shut up and bolted, and the upper lid,\r\nG H, closed, the box may be locked up. When the bees have been shut in\r\nwith the slide in the front, the hive or box is ready to be transported\r\nanywhere, to procure new pasturage for them, which, as every experienced\r\nbee-keeper knows, is of the greatest benefit to prolong their\r\nhoney-harvest.\r\n\r\nPerfect protection from wet and the vicissitudes of temperature, is\r\npartly ensured by the external bee-box being made of well-seasoned wood;\r\npoplar is recommended as of a looser grain than fir, deal, &c., and\r\nconsequently, not so great a conductor of heat; but the objection to\r\nwooden bee-hives or boxes, for being more easily affected by the\r\nvariations of the temperature, is removed by the construction of the\r\n\"bar frame-hive;\" for the bee-frames form, as it were, a smaller box\r\nwithin the oblong box, and are not in immediate contact with the\r\nexternal air, but have a half inch space nearly all round them, which\r\nwill to a certain extent maintain an equable temperature for the bees,\r\nboth in summer and winter.\r\n\r\nAny moisture condensed from the heated air generated by the bees, is\r\ncarried off through the perforated sheets of zinc above the frames, and\r\ncool store-room for the honey is also thus secured.\r\n\r\nA feeding trough is made on the principle of a bird-glass: with a tin\r\nfeeder and a small bottle for the liquid food to be put into.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. IV._]\r\n\r\nThe tin feeder is six inches by 7-1/2 long, and one inch deep, and just\r\nfits on to the top of the bee-frames, where the perforated sheets of\r\nzinc are laid; within this feeder a half inch opening is cut at the\r\nbottom, fig 4, _a_, and an inclined plane _b_, reaching half way up\r\nthe depth of the trough; and a sheet of perforated tin, _c_ (placed\r\nhorizontally from point _b_,) through which the bees suck the food,\r\nwhich is kept at the same level by atmospheric pressure; for as the food\r\nis drawn down below the mouth of the bottle, _d_, air forces itself into\r\nthe bottle, and the same quantity of food trickles down into the feeder,\r\na piece of glass, _e_, exactly the same size as the feeder, is placed\r\nover it, through which the bees may be seen whilst feeding, and the\r\nfeeding trough will be nearly of the same temperature as the interior\r\nof the box or hive, and prevent the bees being chilled, as they would\r\nbe in winter, if compelled to descend for their food; and besides, the\r\nbees are less likely to be attacked by wasps or strange bees when fed\r\nfrom above, as the intruders would have to ascend through the mass of\r\nbees in the box, which would be attended with danger to them.\r\n\r\nThe bees can be fed when necessary by one of the sheets of perforated\r\nzinc being drawn on one side, and the feeding trough, with the bottle of\r\nfood in it, being placed over the opening; when the bees will ascend\r\nthrough the half inch space at _a_, and feed themselves with the liquid,\r\nor carry it away and store it up for future use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIVES AND BEE-BOXES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving given a description of the bar-frame-hive, it will be as well to\r\nenter into the comparative advantages of using wooden boxes and straw\r\nhives.\r\n\r\nSome apiarians confine themselves to the use of straw hives, others to\r\nwooden boxes, and a third party use both; but as far as the bees are\r\nconcerned it matters little what kind of hive is given them, for if the\r\nseason be favourable, and the bee-pasturage rich with flowers, they\r\ncollect and store up the honey in their combs in any receptacle of any\r\nshape or size, provided it affords them shelter from the weather.\r\n\r\nHives made of straw are generally preferred for an out-of-door apiary,\r\nas being less liable to be over-heated by the rays of the sun, and\r\nin the winter they exclude the cold better than hives made of other\r\nmaterials, while the moisture arising from the bees is more quickly\r\nabsorbed within the hive, and does not run down the sides as it\r\ngenerally does in wooden hives or boxes; at the same time they are\r\nalways to be obtained from their cheapness, and from their simplicity\r\neasily understood and made use of; wooden boxes can only be used with\r\nadvantage in a bee-house, they stand firmer on the bottom boards, or\r\none upon another, they admit of having glass windows, through which\r\nto observe the operations of the bees, and they are not so liable to\r\nharbour moths, spiders, and other insects, as the straw hives.\r\n\r\nThe objects to be attained in the construction and management of an\r\napiary, are, to secure the prosperity and multiplication of the colonies\r\nof bees, to increase the amount of their productive labour, and to\r\nobtain their products with facility, and with the least possible\r\ndetriment to the stock. It is to the interest of the owner, therefore,\r\nthat he provide for the bees shelter against moisture, and the extremes\r\nof heat and cold--especially, sudden vicissitudes of temperature,\r\nprotection from their numerous enemies, every facility for constructing\r\ntheir combs and for rearing their brood, and that the hive should be so\r\nconstructed as to allow of every part of the combs to be inspected at\r\nany moment, and capable of removal when requisite: and while attention\r\nis paid to economy, it should be made of materials that will secure its\r\ndurability.\r\n\r\nThese observations apply equally to the straw hives, boxes, or whatever\r\nthe bees may be lodged in or hived. Some cultivators of bees have been\r\nchiefly anxious to promote their multiplication, and to prevent the\r\nescape of the swarms in their natural way, by forming artificial swarms,\r\nby separating a populous hive previous to its swarming, into two parts,\r\nand allowing to each greater room for the construction of their works.\r\nOthers, and the most numerous class, have contemplated only the\r\nabundance of the products which they yield, and the facility of\r\nextracting them from the hive, without showing any particular solicitude\r\nas to the preservation of the bees themselves. Another class of\r\napiarians have, on the other hand, had it more particularly in view,\r\nto facilitate the prosecution of researches in the natural history and\r\neconomy of bees.\r\n\r\nThen, again, amongst apiarians a diversity of opinion exists regarding\r\nthe system to be adopted in the management of the hives, whether the\r\nbees are to be kept in single hives, caps or bell-glasses, and extra\r\nboxes, which may be added at the top, which is called the _storifying_\r\nsystem; or inserting additional room at the bottom, called _nadering_;\r\nor whether adding boxes at the sides, called the _collateral_ system,\r\nshould be followed out; and a plan of ventilating the boxes has been\r\nadded to the last system, but experience has proved that it is utterly\r\nuseless, as in spite of ventilating tubes and thermometers, the bees\r\nhave swarmed, and the queen-bee has deposited her eggs in the collateral\r\nboxes and destroyed the purity of the honey.\r\n\r\nNo successful plan has been yet devised to ventilate the combs where\r\nthe bees cluster; for the bees prevent the circulation of the cold air\r\namongst the combs by immediately forming themselves in thick rows at the\r\nbottom of the combs; and instead of ranging the fields to gather honey\r\nor pollen, have to collect together and idle away their time to retain\r\nthe necessary heat for the formation of the combs, or to rear their\r\nbrood.\r\n\r\nAs a single hive, Huber's leaf-hive is certainly the best; but it\r\nrequires great attention, and none but experienced apiarists can use it\r\nfor the purpose of trying experiments; but in the hands of experienced\r\napiarists it is invaluable. All other single hives are objectionable, as\r\nneither the proceedings of the bees can be observed, nor the honey taken\r\nout, without either destroying the bees, or driving them out with smoke\r\nby which much of the brood is killed; or if rainy weather occur at the\r\ntime the bees are preparing to throw off a swarm, and the hive be filled\r\nto its utmost limits with comb, all the bees must remain idle till the\r\nreturn of fine weather for want of room.\r\n\r\nTo meet this objection, some apiarians have straw-hives with flat wooden\r\ntops made, or use boxes, and have holes cut in them at the top, so that\r\nsmall glasses may be added, when the bees require room. But this does\r\nnot prevent swarming, and besides, the flatness of the roof is\r\nprejudicial, as it allows the moisture which exhales from the bees to\r\ncollect in the roof, and to fall in drops at different parts, to the\r\ngreat injury of the subjacent contents of the hive, and, like the common\r\nstraw hive or square box, the bees cannot be examined, except partially\r\nthrough the windows made in the sides.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this evil, the further plan of _storifying_ hives or boxes,\r\nwas introduced, and by this method swarming may to an extent be\r\nprevented, and the wax and honey can be taken without destroying the\r\nbees; and with the same view was introduced the _collateral_ system,\r\nwhich is adding room at the sides (of course preserving a free\r\ncommunication between the boxes and hives). But there are objections to\r\nthe _collateral_ system, as it is now a very well established fact, that\r\npartitions of any kind are detrimental to the prosperity of the bees;\r\nand the same applies, though perhaps in an inferior degree, to the\r\n_storied_ system, or hives and boxes divided into stories one above\r\nanother; besides that which holds good equally to all hives or boxes,\r\nthat it is not possible to proportion the hives in all cases to the\r\nmagnitude of the swarms, or the energy with which they labour.\r\n\r\nIn single hives the honey becomes bad and discoloured from being put\r\ninto the old breeding cells. In double storied, or collateral hives,\r\nthe bees are divided, and live in different families; while their own\r\npreservation, and that of the brood, requires them to live in the\r\nstrictest union; the heat also necessary for the secretion of wax is\r\nlessened by the division of the bees into different groups. And,\r\nbesides, all these different hives or boxes should have some sort of\r\nprotection from the weather, either in the way of eaves or covers,\r\nor be placed in a shed or bee-house.\r\n\r\nThey require also centre boards and division tins, &c. to separate\r\none hive or box from another, floor boards for them to stand upon,\r\nas well as stands or stools to raise them from the ground, &c., for\r\na description of which, and a full history of all hives and boxes,\r\nI refer the reader to Dr. Bevan's \"Honey-bee.\"\r\n\r\nIn mentioning the defects of these different boxes and hives, I do not\r\nmean to condemn them as useless, for they will all answer to a certain\r\nextent the purposes for which they were intended, rewarding the\r\nattentive bee-keeper, according to the seasons, and enabling the bees to\r\nsend forth many swarms, and collecting and storing up their treasures of\r\nhoney; but my object has been to point out briefly to those anxious for\r\nthe better, more extended, and economical mode of bee-management, the\r\ndifficulties to be provided against, and to recommend to their\r\nconsideration the advantages offered in the bar frame-hive. But,\r\nhowever, I should not be doing justice to Mr. R. Golding, if I did not\r\nparticularly mention his \"improved Grecian hive\" by the use of which\r\ncombs may be removed from the interior of the hive and inspected at\r\npleasure: this improvement he has effected by carefully investigating\r\nthe laws of the insects for whose use the hives were intended, and by a\r\nparticular arrangement of the bars, (every alternate one being furnished\r\nwith guide combs,) the bees have been induced, in a manner at once\r\nsimple and beautiful, to construct a uniform range of combs. When the\r\nhive is filled with honey, two or three, or more of the bars may be,\r\nat any time, removed, or exchanged for unoccupied bars, without much\r\ndisturbing the brood combs, all annoyance from the bees being prevented\r\nby a whiff or two of tobacco smoke being blown into the hive at the time\r\nof the removal of the bars. With the protection of a bee-house these\r\nhives can be applied to many of the systems of bee-management, and prove\r\nequally profitable, and more manageable than some of the newly-invented\r\nhives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APIARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext of importance to the kind of hive and the system to be followed, is\r\nthe proper situation of an apiary. This subject engaged the attention of\r\nbee-keepers in ancient as much as in modern times; but the directions\r\ngiven by Columella and Virgil are as good now as when they were written;\r\nand as is observed by the writer in No. CXLI. of the Quarterly Review,\r\nin the amusing article on \"Bee-books,\"--\"It would amply repay (and this\r\nis saying a great deal,) the most forgetful country gentleman to rub\r\nup his schoolboy Latin, for the sole pleasure he would derive from the\r\nperusal of the fourth Georgic.\" The aspect has been regarded as of the\r\nfirst importance; but there are points of greater consequence, namely\r\nthe vicinity of good bee pasturage, the shelter of the hives from the\r\nwinds by trees or houses, and their distance from ponds or rivers, as\r\nthe high winds might dash the bees into the water.\r\n\r\nVarious aspects have been recommended, but the south, with a point to\r\nthe east or west, according to its situation as respects the shelter it\r\nmay receive from walls or trees, &c. is the best: care, however, must be\r\ntaken that neither walls, trees, nor anything else impede the going\r\nforth of the bees to their pasturage.\r\n\r\n\"I have ever found it best,\" says Wildman, \"to place the mouth of\r\nthe hives to the west in spring, care being taken that they have the\r\nafternoon sun; the morning sun is extremely dangerous during the colder\r\nmonths, when its glare often tempts these industrious insects out to\r\ntheir ruin; whereas the mouth of the hive being then in the shade, the\r\nbees remain at home; and as clouds generally obscure the afternoon's sun\r\nat that season, the bees escape the temptation of going out. When food\r\nis to be obtained, the warmth of the air continues round the hive in\r\nthe afternoon, which enables the bees to pursue their labours without\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nA valley is a better situation for an apiary than a hill, being more\r\nconvenient to the bees returning home with their loads; and, besides,\r\nbees are not so apt to fly away when swarming as when on a hill: but\r\nwhen swarms take a distant flight, they generally fly against the wind,\r\nso that the stragglers of the swarms may better hear the direction of\r\nthe course taken by their fellow emigrants.\r\n\r\nI recommend a hard gravel terrace for the hives to be placed upon, as\r\nbeing drier both in summer and winter for the bee-master to walk upon,\r\nwhen inspecting his bees, and also as less likely to afford shelter for\r\nants or other enemies to bees; and, besides, it is better for the bees,\r\nwhich when much fatigued by their journeys, or benumbed by the cold, are\r\napt to fall around the hives, and would recover more quickly from the\r\nwarmth of the dry ground than if they had alighted on damp grass.\r\n\r\nThe hives should not be placed where water from the eaves of houses,\r\nfrom hedges, or trees, drop upon them; but they should be near the\r\nmansion house for the convenience of watching the bees, &c.\r\n\r\nA small stream of water running near the hives is thought to be of\r\nadvantage, especially in dry seasons, with gently declining banks,\r\nin order that the bees may have safe access to it.\r\n\r\nHeaths, or places abounding in wild flowers, constitute the best\r\nneighbourhood for an apiary, and in default of this pasturage, there\r\nshould be gardens where flowers are cultivated, and fields in which\r\nbuck-wheat, clover, or sainfoin, is sown.\r\n\r\nBut cultivating small gardens of flowers for bees is useless, except a\r\nfew early flowers near the hives for the bees to collect some pollen for\r\nthe brood, such as the common kinds of crocus, white alyssum, single\r\nblue hepaticas, helleborus niger, and tussilago petasites, all of which\r\nflower early; but should any of the tribe of the willows grow near,\r\nthere will be no necessity for cultivating the flowers above-mentioned,\r\nas they yield an abundant harvest of farina, or pollen.\r\n\r\nA rich corn country is well known to be a barren desert to the bees\r\nduring a greater portion of the year. Hence the judicious practice of\r\nshifting the bees from place to place according to the circumstances of\r\nthe season, and the custom of other nations in this particular well\r\ndeserves our imitation.\r\n\r\nFew places are so happily situated as to afford bees proper pasturage\r\nboth in the beginning of the season and also the autumn; it was the\r\nadvice of Celsus that, after the vernal pastures are consumed, they\r\nshould be transported to places abounding with autumnal flowers; as was\r\npractised by conveying the bees from Achaia to Attica, from Euboea and\r\nthe Cyclad Islands to Syrus, and also in Sicily, where they were brought\r\nto Hybla from other parts of the island.\r\n\r\nPliny states that the custom of removing bees from place to place for\r\nfresh pasturage was frequent in the Roman territories, and such is still\r\nthe practice of the Italians who live near the banks of the Po, (the\r\nriver which Pliny particularly instances,) mentioned by Alexander de\r\nMontfort, who says that the Italians treat their bees in nearly the same\r\nmanner as the Egyptians did and still do; that they load boats with\r\nhives and convey them to the neighbourhood of the mountains of Piedmont;\r\nthat in proportion as the bees gather in their harvest, the boats, by\r\ngrowing heavier, sink deeper into the water; and that the watermen\r\ndetermine from this, when their hives are loaded sufficiently, and it is\r\ntime to carry them back to their places from which they came. The same\r\nauthor relates that the people of the country of Juliers used the same\r\npractice; for that, at a certain season of the year, they carried their\r\nbees to the foot of mountains that were covered with wild thyme.\r\n\r\nM. Maillet, who was the French Consul in Egypt in 1692, says in his\r\ncurious description of Egypt; \"that in spite of the ignorance and\r\nrusticity which have got possession of that country, there yet remain in\r\nit several traces of the industry and skill of the ancient Egyptians.\"\r\nOne of their most admirable contrivances is, the sending their bees\r\nannually into different districts to collect food, at a time when they\r\ncould not find any at home.\r\n\r\nAbout the end October, all such inhabitants of Lower Egypt, as have\r\nhives of bees, embark them on the Nile, and convey them up that river\r\nquite into Upper Egypt; observing to time it so that they arrive there\r\njust when the inundation is withdrawn, the lands have been sown, and the\r\nflowers begin to bud. The hives thus sent are marked and numbered by\r\ntheir respective owners, and placed pyramidically in boats prepared for\r\nthe purpose. After they have remained some time at their furthest\r\nstation, and are supposed to have gathered all the pollen and honey they\r\ncould find in the fields within two or three leagues around, their\r\nconductors convey them in the same boats, two or three leagues lower\r\ndown, and there leave the laborious insects so long a time as is\r\nnecessary for them to collect all the riches of this spot. Thus the\r\nnearer they come to the place of their more permanent abode, they find\r\nthe plants which afford them food, forward in proportion.\r\n\r\nIn fine, about the beginning of February, after having travelled through\r\nthe whole length of Egypt, and gathered all the rich produce of the\r\ndelightful banks of the Nile, they arrive at the mouth of that river,\r\ntowards the ocean; from whence they had set out: care is taken to keep\r\nan exact register of every district from whence the hives were sent\r\nin the beginning of the season, of their numbers, of the names of the\r\npersons who sent them, and likewise of the mark or number of the boat\r\nin which they were placed.\r\n\r\nNiebuhr saw upon the Nile, between Cairo and Damietta, a convoy of\r\nfour thousand hives, in their transit from Upper Egypt to the Delta.\r\nSavary, in his letters on Egypt, also gives an account of the manner of\r\ntransporting the hives down the Nile. In France floating bee-houses are\r\ncommon. Goldsmith describes from his own observation, a kind of floating\r\napiary in some parts of France and Piedmont. \"They have on board of one\r\nbarge,\" he says, \"three score or a hundred bee-hives, well defended\r\nfrom the inclemency of an accidental storm, and with these the owners\r\nfloat quietly down the stream: one bee-hive yields the proprietor a\r\nconsiderable income. Why,\" he adds, \"a method similar to this has never\r\nbeen adopted in England where we have more gentle rivers, and more\r\nflowery banks, than in any part of the world, I know not; certainly it\r\nmight be turned to advantage.\"\r\n\r\nThey have also a method of transporting their hives by land in carts in\r\nGermany; and particularly in Hanover travelling caravans of bees may be\r\nseen during the season.\r\n\r\nI have thus briefly quoted from famous authorities, to impress upon\r\nthose who keep apiaries the importance of transporting their bees from\r\npasture to pasture.\r\n\r\nThe advantage to weak swarms is very great, \"but whilst so little of the\r\ntrue principles of bee management is understood, as that the destruction\r\nof the bees has been considered absolutely essential, in order to the\r\nattainment of their stores, it is no wonder that so little attention\r\nshould have been paid to their cultivation in this country, and that it\r\nshould not have proved a more productive department of rural economy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bees, like everything else worth possessing, require care and\r\nattention; but persons generally think it is quite sufficient to procure\r\na hive and a swarm, and set it down in the middle of a garden, and that\r\nstreams of honey and money will forthwith flow; and, perhaps, commence\r\ncalculating, from the perusal of the statements of the profits made by\r\nThorley from a single hive, which he estimates to be 4300_l._ 16_s._\r\nfrom 8192 hives kept during fourteen years! deducting ten shillings and\r\nsixpence, the cost of the first hive!\"\r\n\r\nThe bar and frame-hives are so constructed that they can be moved from\r\nplace to place with the greatest ease, and, perhaps, this may be an\r\ninducement for bee-masters to try the recommendations of transporting\r\nbees, and thus avoid one expense of feeding them during the winter.\r\n\r\nConnected with the foregoing subject of transporting bees from place to\r\nplace, is the question of the distance to which bees extend their flight\r\nin search of food, &c.; and the comparative excellence of the position\r\nof an apiary depends in some measure on the greater or less distance the\r\nbees will have to fly to their pasturage.\r\n\r\nDr. Chambers, and Dr. Hunter were of opinion, that the bee cannot extend\r\nits flight beyond a mile, which idea they adopted on the authority of\r\nSchirach; but then it must be recollected that the German mile of\r\nSchirach is equal to about 3-1/2 English miles.\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of Huber, that the radii of the circle of the\r\nflight of the bee extended nearly to four English miles. And Huish says\r\n\"The travelling apiaries of Germany, particularly those of Hanover,\r\nare regulated by the prevailing opinion, that the bee can, and does,\r\nextend its flight to four and even five miles; and acting upon that\r\nsupposition, when the bee-masters move their apiaries, they always\r\ntravel about two _stunden_, that is, about eight miles, as they then\r\ncalculate that the bees are beyond the former range of their pasture\r\nby four miles.\" And adds, \"a travelling apiary of 80 or 100 hives will\r\nexhaust the food within the area of a circle of four miles in about\r\na fortnight or three weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"But certainly there is no reason to fear that any part of this country\r\nwill be overstocked with bees, for where one hive is now kept, fifty\r\nmight be kept without running any risk of overstocking the country; for\r\nthe average number of hives in the various apiaries does not exceed\r\nfive.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been calculated\" says another authority, \"that the pastures of\r\nScotland could maintain as many bees as would produce 4,000,000 pints\r\nof honey, and 1,000,000 lbs. of wax; and were these quantities tripled\r\nfor England and Ireland, the produce of the British empire would be\r\n12,000,000 pints of honey, and 3,000,000 lbs. of wax per annum, worth\r\nabout five shillings per pint for the honey, and one shilling and\r\nsixpence per lb. for the wax, making an annual produce in money of about\r\n3,225,000_l._\r\n\r\nBut in consequence of the present neglect of this branch of rural\r\neconomy, we pay annually nearly 12,000_l._ for honey alone.\r\n\r\nThe imports and exports of wax bleached and unbleached were as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             Returned\r\n               Imported.

It is recorded by Xenophon in his\r\nAnabasis that, during the retreat of the ten thousand, the soldiers\r\nsucked some honey-combs in a place near Trebizonde, and in consequence\r\nbecame intoxicated, and did not recover their strength for three or four\r\ndays; and these effects are supposed to have been produced from the\r\nhoney having been extracted by the bees from the rhododendron ponticum\r\nor azalea pontica of Linnæus.\r\n\r\nAlthough many of these plants have been introduced into this country,\r\nyet, probably from their small proportion to the whole of the flowers in\r\nbloom, the honey collected by the bees has not been found to be injured\r\nor to have produced any evil consequences.\r\n\r\nThe goodness and flavour of honey depend on the fragrance of the plants\r\nfrom which the bees collect it, and hence it is that the honey of\r\ndifferent places is held in different degrees of estimation.\r\n\r\nThe honey gathered from the genus erica (termed _heather honey_) and\r\nmost labiate plants, is wholesome. That which is made early in the year\r\nis preferred to what is collected in the latter end of the season.\r\nWhilst on the subject of honey, I will add the directions given by\r\nWildman, how to separate the honey from the wax: \"Take,\" he says, \"the\r\ncombs which have been extracted from the different hives or boxes into\r\na close room, rather warm than otherwise, that the honey may drain more\r\nfreely, and keep the doors and windows shut, to prevent the bees from\r\nentering, or else they will be very troublesome, and will attack and\r\ncarry away the greater part of the honey from the combs.\r\n\r\n\"Lay aside such combs as have young bees or brood in them, as they\r\nwould give your honey a bad flavour and render it unwholesome, and the\r\nbee-brood must also be separated and melted with the brood-combs. When\r\nyou have thus separated the combs, let such as are very fine be nicely\r\ndrained by themselves, without the least pressing whatever, having been\r\ncarefully cleaned of every sort of filth, or insects, and dividing each\r\ncomb in such a manner that the cells may be open at both ends, and\r\nplacing them upon a sieve or coarse cloth, that the honey may drain\r\noff quite pure and undefiled. The remainder of the combs from which\r\nthe honey has been thus drained, together with those which contained\r\nthe bee-bread and brood, must be put into a coarse cloth or bag, and\r\nsqueezed or pressed to get all the honey out. This will make it inferior\r\nin quality, and unfit for many uses, therefore it should be put into\r\npots or bottles by itself, to feed bees with, for which purpose it will\r\nbe better than pure honey, on account of the bee-bread that will be\r\nmixed with it, which is necessary for their subsistence.\r\n\r\n\"In order to obtain the wax in a pure state, what remains of the combs\r\nafter separating the honey, together with the empty combs which had been\r\nlaid aside, should be put into a copper with clean water; made to boil\r\ngently over a slow fire, keeping it constantly stirring. When it is\r\nmelted, run it through a coarse cloth or bag made for the purpose, and\r\nput it into a press to separate the wax from the dross. Let the wax run\r\nfrom the press into a vessel placed under it, into which put some water\r\nto prevent the wax adhering to the sides.\r\n\r\n\"If this process of boiling and pressing is repeated twice or even three\r\ntimes, the wax will be much purer and consequently of greater value.\r\nSet it in a place where it may cool by degrees, in pans of the size you\r\nwould choose your cakes to be, with some water in them, to prevent the\r\nwax sticking to the sides whilst hot. Honey should be kept only in stone\r\njars, called Bristol ware, and in a cool and dry situation, but not\r\ncorked up until a week or two after it has transuded through the sieve,\r\n&c., but should be carefully covered with perforated sheets of zinc to\r\nkeep out insects and flies, &c. after which period the jars may be\r\nsecured and put into the store-rooms.\r\n\r\n\"The only protection necessary for gentlemen,--for ladies, I presume,\r\nwould never venture to undertake the dangerous task of extracting the\r\nhoney combs from hives or boxes,--will be a pair of buckskin gloves,\r\nwith a pair of worsted gloves over them extending to the elbows; so that\r\nthe bees should not be able to creep between the gloves and the sleeves;\r\nfor the face a piece of wire pattern gauze net, made in the shape of a\r\nbag, to draw with a string round the hat above the brim, which will keep\r\nit from the face, and the other open end being secured under the neck\r\nhandkerchief, and with the assistance of a puff or two of smoke into any\r\nhive intended to be operated upon, the bee-master may fearlessly turn up\r\nthe hive, and cut out combs or dislodge bees from their habitations, &c.\r\nwith impunity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENEMIES TO BEES, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proprietor having provided shelter for his bees, and as great a\r\nplenty of pasture as he possibly can, should next be careful to guard\r\nthem from the numerous enemies which prey upon them, and destroy their\r\nhoney-combs. Bees themselves, in the autumn and spring, are very often\r\ngreat enemies to one another, and rob each other's hives, especially\r\nin dry seasons, when the honey gathering is almost over; and the bees\r\nfrom over-stocked hives, not having honey sufficient for their winter's\r\nstore, will through necessity attack the old hives or stocks, which are\r\nthinned by over swarming, carry away all their honey, and often destroy\r\ntheir queens. In order to prevent this havoc, contract the entrance or\r\nentrances of the hive attempted to be robbed, so that a few bees only\r\ncan enter at a time, by which means the old stocks will be better\r\nable to defend themselves. If, notwithstanding this narrowness of the\r\npassage, robbers attack a hive, the entrance should be instantly closed\r\nand kept so till the thieves are gone, and it will be advisable in the\r\nevening to examine the state of the hive, especially as to weight, and\r\nif the queen be safe, remove it to another place, at least a mile from\r\nthe old locality. The person who is thus employed, at a time when the\r\nbees are full of resentment, should be well defended from their stings.\r\nBut, should he be so unfortunate as to get stung for his interference,\r\nthe first thing is to extract the sting. To alleviate the irritation,\r\ncooling lotions should be applied, but the pain of a sting is relieved\r\nby applying spirits of hartshorn, or liquor potassæ, to the spot where\r\nthe sting entered.\r\n\r\nOne would imagine the moth to be an enemy of no consequence, but the\r\nwax-moth (_Tinea mellonella_) is a most formidable enemy. She lays her\r\neggs under the very skirts of the hive, or in the rubbish on the floor,\r\nor even in the combs of the bees; these eggs when hatched produce a\r\nsmall whitish worm or larva, and it is in this stage that it commits its\r\nravages, extending its galleries through every quarter of the combs,\r\ndetaching them from the tops and sides of the hives, and causing them\r\nto fall together.\r\n\r\nThe way to destroy them is frequently to lift up the hive in the\r\nmorning, and kill all you can see. The most effectual way is to drive\r\nthe bees into a new hive, but this can be only done in the height of\r\nthe honey season; or the affected combs may be cut out, and the bees\r\nrestored to their old habitation.\r\n\r\nMice are likewise very destructive to bees; sometimes they enter at the\r\ndoor, but most commonly near the top of the hive; this they do generally\r\nduring winter, when the bees are in a torpid state; when this is\r\nsuspected, set a few traps about the hives.\r\n\r\nThe common bat will also sometimes take possession of a hive, and commit\r\nvery great havoc amongst the bees.\r\n\r\nWasps and hornets must be destroyed, if possible, either by gunpowder,\r\nor by the more primitive mode of placing limed twigs before the holes,\r\nwhen you have discovered their nests.\r\n\r\nThe spring is the time to kill the female wasps and hornets, for then,\r\nby the death of one female, a whole nest is destroyed. Or place bottles\r\nhalf full of sugar and beer where the wasps frequent; they will go in to\r\ndrink, and drown themselves in the liquor, not being able to get out of\r\nthe bottle again. Spiders must be killed, and their nets or webs broken\r\ndown, otherwise they will catch and destroy many bees.\r\n\r\nSwallows, frogs, ants, earwigs, snails, woodlice, poultry, and small\r\nbirds of almost all kinds, are reckoned amongst their foes. And,\r\ntherefore, there should be no lack of vigilance on the part of the owner\r\nof bees, to keep the bee-house as clean as possible from all vermin.\r\n\r\nThe signs of dysentery having commenced in any colony of bees may be\r\nknown by the floor-boards and combs being covered with stains, by the\r\ndark coloured evacuations, producing an offensive smell, and frequent\r\ndeaths amongst the bees. \"Bees,\" says Gelieu, \"have no real disease;\r\nthey are always in good health as long as they are at liberty, are kept\r\nwarm, and provided with plenty of food. All their pretended diseases are\r\nthe result of cold, hunger, or the infection produced by a too close and\r\nlong confinement during winter, and by exposure to damp, &c.\"\r\n\r\nThey appear however sometimes to be seized, in the spring, with\r\ndysentery; this is occasioned by their feeding too greedily, it is\r\nsupposed, on honey dew, without the mixture of pollen and other\r\nwholesome nutriment.\r\n\r\nThe only remedy that has been found for this disease, is to give the\r\nbees plenty of honey, such honey as that extracted from the refuse combs\r\nin the autumn, that had abundance of bee-bread pressed amongst it,--the\r\nmore the better,--mixing with it a table-spoonful of salt, and giving\r\nthe bees their full liberty, and a clean hive. Many things are necessary\r\nfor the preservation of bees, but more especially in this country, where\r\nthe bees have only one season in five, on an average of years, really\r\ngood for their honey harvest; wherefore the owner should take care to\r\nprovide the light stocks with a sufficient quantity of food, which they\r\nhave not been able to secure by their own industry, either through the\r\nbadness of the bee-pasturage, the inclemency of the seasons, the\r\nweakness of the colony, or the spoil made by their enemies; and\r\nsometimes by the ill-judged management of their owners, in robbing the\r\nbees beyond the bounds of reason.\r\n\r\nBy this last unjust way of proceeding, these poor industrious little\r\ninsects are absolutely starved, and their greedy masters deservedly\r\nexperience the old proverb; that \"Too much covetousness breaks the bag.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to ascertain what quantity of honey will serve a hive\r\nof bees the whole winter, because the number in the hive may be more or\r\nless, and in some years, the spring is more forward than in others; but\r\n25 lbs. is said to be the quantity required in a common cottage-hive.\r\nDuring frost, the bees consume very little food indeed; and still less\r\nduring severe cold weather. Mr. White (with many other apiarians) is of\r\nopinion, that a greater degree of cold than is commonly imagined to be\r\nproper for bees is favourable to them in winter, for the bees during\r\nthat period, are in so lethargic a state, that little food supports\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe best method to feed the weak stocks, if in one of Mr. R. Golding's\r\nimproved Grecian hives, is to place some combs (drone combs reserved for\r\nthat purpose) filled on one side with honey, over the centre-board, and\r\ncovering it over with a common hive.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of feeding bees from above is great; they are less likely\r\nto be attacked by the bees from other hives, and they do not become\r\nbenumbed by the cold, as the same temperature is maintained above as in\r\nthe rest of the hive.\r\n\r\nBut in all cases, bees should be fed in autumn, and before they are in\r\nabsolute want of food, otherwise they will be so poor and weak that they\r\nwill not be able to ascend or descend to feed themselves. When that\r\nhappens, it is almost too late to save them; however, you may try and\r\nfeed them, by first tying a piece of gauze over the bottom of the hive,\r\nturning it up to receive the heat of the sun or fire, and, if the bees\r\nrevive at all, place a pewter dish with some liquid honey in it, on the\r\nfloor-board, and the hive over it, when the bees will draw up the honey\r\nthrough the gauze or net without smearing themselves, the the pewter\r\ndish having been filled with hot water to keep the honey liquid, and to\r\ndiffuse a genial warmth throughout the hive, and thus secure them for\r\na time from the cold, which would chill and even kill the bees in the\r\nwinter, when they came down to the bottom of the hive to feed on the\r\nproffered bounty.\r\n\r\nIn prosperous hives or colonies, as soon as the severity of the winter's\r\nfrost is past, the queen-bee begins to lay her eggs in the various cells\r\nin the combs, and proceeds in proportion to the mildness of the season\r\nto deposit a succession. The number of young bees that may by this means\r\nrise in a hive, may endanger the lives of all the bees by famine, for\r\nthe increased multitude consume a great deal of honey, an accident\r\nlikely to happen if the mild weather of January or February should be\r\nsucceeded by cold, rainy, or even dry weather; for it is found that the\r\nflowers do not secrete the sweet juices, which constitute honey, so\r\nfreely during the prevalence of dry easterly winds; and thus present a\r\nbarren field for the out-of-door labours of the bees.\r\n\r\nOn this account, the proprietor should examine the hives frequently at\r\nthis season, that, if necessary, he may give them a proper supply, in\r\nwhich he should be bountiful rather than otherwise, because the bees are\r\nfaithful stewards, and will return with interest what is thus in their\r\ngreat need bestowed upon them.\r\n\r\nThe time of the bees' swarming is generally in the months of May and\r\nJune, and sometimes July, but the latter is too late, as there are then\r\nfewer bees than in the earlier swarms, and they seldom live through the\r\nwinter without much care and feeding.\r\n\r\nThe later swarms should be hived in rather smaller hives than the first,\r\nthat, by clustering together, they may the better nourish and keep\r\nthemselves warm.\r\n\r\nThe hours of their swarming are for the most part about twelve o'clock\r\nat noon, never before eight, and seldom after four in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe symptom of swarming, is generally the unusual number of bees seen\r\nhanging at the mouth of the hive, and if a piping noise, or a shrill\r\nnote, which is made by the queen is heard, it is a sure index the bees\r\nwill swarm, if the weather be warm and dry.\r\n\r\nIf the bees work a comb under the floor-board, as is sometimes the case,\r\nit is a sign they will not swarm; a more certain sign is when they throw\r\nout the young dead queens with the drone brood. When they retain the\r\ndrones in the hives after August, it is a bad omen, as they are then\r\nreserved for the sake of the young queens, which they are expecting to\r\nraise; and the season being too far advanced, and their failing in the\r\nattempt, and being without a queen, the colony will most certainly\r\ndwindle away, before the next season.\r\n\r\nAlways choose a hive proportionable to the size of your swarm, and\r\nprepare to hive them as soon as possible, lest they should rise again.\r\nIt is not unusual to ring a bell or tinkle a brass pan, &c., at the time\r\nthe bees swarm; it is also a common method to dress the hives with\r\nhoney, balm, &c.\r\n\r\nI mention these things, because they are customs of long standing: the\r\ntinkling of bells is of little use, as the bees will generally settle\r\nnear the hive; and as to dressing the hives, I by no means recommend it,\r\nas the bees like a clean new hive much better, for it does not give them\r\nso much trouble to clean, &c.\r\n\r\nIf the swarm should rise in the full heat of the day, and the sun shine\r\nhot upon them, they will not continue long in their first situation; for\r\nwhen they find they have all got their company together, they will soon\r\nuncluster, rise again, fly to some particular spot which has been fixed\r\nupon for that purpose by detached parties of bees, who return and\r\nacquaint the swarm; therefore I would advise to hive them as soon as\r\npossible, and remove them in the evening to the place where they are\r\nto remain.\r\n\r\nThe supposed relative value of early and late swarms is thus mentioned\r\nin an old English proverb:--\r\n\r\n  A swarm in May,\r\n  Is worth a load of hay.\r\n  A swarm in June,\r\n  Is worth a silver spoon;\r\n  A swarm in July,\r\n  Is not worth a fly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWARMING AND HIVING THE BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery good swarm should weigh about 5 lbs., and according to the account\r\ngiven in Key's Treatise, would contain 23,000 bees. The manner of hiving\r\nthem must be regulated chiefly by the places upon which they alight.\r\n\r\nIf they settle on a dead hedge, or upon the ground, set a hive over\r\nthem, putting props under it if necessary, and, with a large spoon or\r\nbrush of wet weeds, stir them softly underneath, and they will go in.\r\n\r\nIf they should happen to settle upon a small bough, you may cut it off,\r\nand laying it quietly on a cloth, place a hive over them; or if you\r\ncannot conveniently separate the bough from the body of the tree, you\r\nmay shake or sweep them off into the hive.\r\n\r\nIf the sun shines hot upon it, shade it with a few boughs, &c., but let\r\nit remain near the place where the bees settled until the evening, at\r\nwhich time move it to the bee-house, or the place where it is to stand\r\nduring the season, as just directed.\r\n\r\nIf the bees have hung a considerable time to the place where they first\r\nsettled, you will, perhaps, find it difficult entirely to dislodge them,\r\nas they will neglect their labour and fly about the spot for many days\r\nafterwards. The best method to prevent this is, by rubbing the branches\r\nwith rue, or any kind of herb disagreeable to the bees; but be careful\r\nnot to hurt any of the bees.\r\n\r\nSwarms seldom return home again, when they are well settled, and if you\r\nfind them inclined to do so, depend upon it, some accident has happened\r\nto their queen, which you will easily ascertain by their making a\r\nmurmuring noise, and running in a distracted manner over and about the\r\nsides of the hive. When you observe this, immediately seek about for\r\nher, beginning with the stock-hive from whence the swarm rose, and\r\npursue the track they took at setting out; you will seldom miss finding\r\nher, for she is never alone, but generally encompassed with a cluster of\r\nbees, who would sooner perish than leave her in danger.\r\n\r\nWhen you have found her, take her up gently, and put her to the swarm,\r\nand you will soon find the cause of their dissatisfaction removed by the\r\narrival of the queen.\r\n\r\nThe greatest care must be taken to have your hive clean and sweet, free\r\nfrom loose straws or other obstacles, which will create great trouble\r\nand loss of time to the bees, if left to them to remove.\r\n\r\nIf bees have flowers suitable to their tastes, and no great distance\r\nto travel to them, they will fill their hives both with honey and wax,\r\nin about a month or five weeks, and, if the season has proved fair and\r\npleasant, in less time; but the bee-keeper must expect four out of every\r\nfive seasons to be unpropitious to his little charge, and, therefore,\r\nhe must be on the watch to assist them with food in the time of need.\r\n\r\nScarcely has the swarm arrived at its new habitation, when the working\r\nbees labour with the utmost diligence, to procure food and build their\r\ncombs. Their principal aim is not only to have cells in which they may\r\ndeposit the honey and pollen, but a stronger motive seems to animate\r\nthem; they seem to know that their queen is about to deposit her eggs;\r\nand their industry is such, that in four and twenty hours they will\r\nhave made combs, twelve inches long, and three or four inches wide.\r\nThey build more combs during the first fortnight, than they do during\r\nall the rest of the year.\r\n\r\nOther bees are at the same time busy in stopping all the holes and\r\ncrevices they happen to find in their new hive, in order to guard\r\nagainst the entrance of insects which covet their honey, their wax, or\r\nthemselves; and also to exclude the cold air; for it is indispensably\r\nnecessary that they be lodged warm and secure from damp, &c.\r\n\r\nA second swarm scarcely is, and much less are the third ones called\r\n_casts_ worth keeping single, because, being few in number, they cannot\r\nallow so large a proportion of working bees to go abroad in search of\r\nprovisions, as more numerous swarms can, after retaining a proper number\r\nfor the various works to be done within the hive.\r\n\r\nBees sometimes swarm so often that the mother-hive is too much weakened\r\nor reduced in population. In this case they should be restored; and this\r\nshould also be done when a swarm produces a swarm the first summer, as\r\nis sometimes the case in early seasons.\r\n\r\nThe best way, indeed, is to prevent such swarming, by giving the bees\r\nmore room; though this, again, will not answer where there is a prolific\r\nyoung queen in the hive; as she well knows that her life is the forfeit\r\nof her remaining at home.\r\n\r\nBefore the union of one or two casts or late swarms is made, it is\r\nbetter to kill one of the queens, if possible, to prevent the queens\r\ndestroying one another.\r\n\r\nIf an old hive is full of bees, and yet shows no disposition to swarm,\r\npuff in a little smoke at the entrance of the hive, then turn the hive\r\nup, and give it some slight strokes on the sides so as to alarm the\r\nbees. They will immediately run to the extremities of the combs, and\r\nif you then attentively examine them, you will, in all probability,\r\nperceive the queen-bee the foremost amongst them. Seize her between your\r\nfore finger and thumb, and confine her in your hand till most part of\r\nthe bees take wing; let her then go, the bees will soon join her, and\r\nsettle on some branch of a tree. Put them into an empty hive. Restore\r\nthe old hive in its place, that the bees which have been out in the\r\nfields may enter it on their return, and having allowed them to remain\r\nthere an hour or two, place it upon another stand near or next to its\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThe hive having what may now be called a swarm in it, is then placed\r\non the stand of the old stock; and if the bees in both hives work\r\nregularly, carrying in loads of pollen on their thighs, all is well.\r\n\r\nBees are not apt to sting when they swarm naturally, therefore, it is\r\nnot necessary then to take extraordinary precaution against them; but\r\nwhen any of these violent and artificial modes are attempted, I should\r\nadvise the operator to be well guarded at all points.\r\n\r\nWildman weighed bees and found it required 4,928 bees to make a pound of\r\nsixteen ounces, but the different circumstances in bees may occasion a\r\nconsiderable difference in their weight. When the bees swarm, they come\r\nout loaded with wax secreted in their wax pockets and honey in their\r\nhoney bags, and would weigh heavier than bees taken for that purpose\r\nby chance; and, therefore, the number of the bees is not to be thus\r\ncomputed, from the weight of the swarm; for one fourth of the number at\r\nleast should be deducted, in lieu of the wax and honey they have brought\r\noff with them. There is also another allowance to be made, namely, that\r\nwhen alive, they do not probably weigh so heavy as when dead.\r\n\r\nThe person who intends to erect an apiary, should purchase a proper\r\nnumber of hives at the latter end of the year, when they are cheapest.\r\nThe hives should be full of combs, and well stored with bees.\r\n\r\nThe purchaser should examine the combs, in order to know the age of the\r\nhives. The combs of that season are white, those of a darkish yellow are\r\nof the previous year; and, where the combs are black, the hives should\r\nbe rejected, because old hives are most liable to vermin and other\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\nIf the number of hives wanted were not purchased in the autumn, it will\r\nbe necessary to remedy this neglect after the severity of the cold is\r\npast in the spring. At this season, bees which are in good condition,\r\nwill get into the fields early in the morning, return loaded, enter\r\nboldly, and do not come out of the hive in bad weather; for when they\r\ndo, this indicates that they are in great want of provisions.\r\n\r\nThey are alert on the least disturbance; and by the loudness of their\r\nhumming, you can judge of their strength. They preserve their hives\r\nfree from filth, and are ready to defend it against every enemy that\r\napproaches.\r\n\r\nBut the better plan is at once to commence with new hives, and purchase\r\nthe first and strong swarms to put into them, and introduce them into\r\nthe bee-house.\r\n\r\nThere are various substances found in a hive, such as the _wax_, with\r\nwhich the combs are built, the _honey_, the _farina_ or _pollen_, with\r\nwhich the bee-brood is fed, and _propolis_.\r\n\r\n_Honey_, is a fluid or semi-fluid substance, the materials of which are\r\ncollected by the bees, from the nectaries at the base of the corollæ of\r\nflowers, where this vegetable production is secreted.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said to be a purely vegetable production when found\r\nin the combs, for after being collected by the insect by means of its\r\nproboscis, it is transmitted into what is called the honey bag, where it\r\nis elaborated, and, hurrying homewards with its precious load, the bee\r\nregurgitates it into the cell of the honey comb. It takes a great many\r\ndrops to fill a cell, as the honey bag when full does not exceed the\r\nsize of a small pea.\r\n\r\nWhen the cell is full, it is sealed up with a mixture of of wax and\r\npollen, and reserved for future use in winter and spring.\r\n\r\n_Wax_. There are several varieties of this substance, but bees-wax is a\r\nsecretion of that insect from its ventral scales. With this substance\r\nthe comb is constructed; it takes the bees, according to Huber's\r\naccount, twenty-four hours to secrete the six laminæ of wax in the wax\r\npockets, which may be seen to exude between the segments of the under\r\nside of the abdomen of the bee. For the purpose of the formation of wax,\r\nthe bees have to cluster and form themselves into festoons from the top\r\nof the hive, and after the elapse of the necessary period, the wax\r\nscales are formed, with which the bees commence immediately to build\r\ntheir combs, and the various cells for the reception of the brood or\r\nfood, according to the season of the year.\r\n\r\n_Propolis_, is a tenacious, semi-transparent substance, having a\r\nbalsamic odour; which the bees gather from the buds of certain trees in\r\nthe spring, such as the horse-chestnut, the willow, the poplar, and the\r\nbirch.\r\n\r\nThis tenacious substance is employed by the bees to attach more firmly\r\nthe combs to the top or foundation, and also the edges of the combs to\r\nthe sides of the hive or box, to stop the crevices, and fasten the hives\r\nor boxes to the floor-boards, and in forming barriers against the\r\nintrusion of enemies.\r\n\r\n_Farina_, or _Pollen_, is the dust or minute globules contained in the\r\nanthers of flowers, and is the fertilizing property of flowers, which\r\nthe bees thus assist to carry, whilst travelling from flower to flower,\r\nwithout which the flowers would not fructify. The bees have been found\r\nto continue collecting pollen from the same species of flowers, and\r\nprevent the multiplication of hybrid plants. They collect and carry\r\nthis substance on the outer surface of the tibia, or the middle joint\r\nof the hinder leg; this part of the leg is broad, and on one side it\r\nis concave, and furnished with a row of strong hairs on its margins,\r\nforming as it were a natural basket, well adapted for the purpose. This\r\nsubstance mixed with honey, forms the food of the larvæ or young brood,\r\nafter undergoing, perhaps, a peculiar elaboration by the working or\r\nnurse bees.\r\n\r\nHaving thus mentioned the different substances found in a hive, it only\r\nremains to add a short history of the inmates of the hive. Every swarm\r\nof bees comprises three distinct kinds of the same species, namely, the\r\n_female_ or _queen_, the _neuter_ or _worker-bee_, and the _male_ or\r\n_drone_.\r\n\r\nAs there is only one _queen-bee_ in each swarm or colony, she is seldom\r\nto be seen amidst the thousands of other bees; but she is easily\r\ndistinguished from the rest by her slower movements, her greater length\r\nand larger size; and the general appearance of her body, being of a more\r\ndark orange colour, and her hinder legs having neither brushes nor\r\npollen baskets upon them, although longer than those of the worker-bee;\r\nher wings also appear stronger, and she possesses a more curved sting,\r\nwhich she seldom uses, except when asserting her rights to the\r\nsovereignty of the hive.\r\n\r\nWithout a _queen-bee_ no swarm can thrive, for she is not only the\r\nruler, but chiefly the mother of the community in which she dwells, and\r\nwherever she goes, the greatest attention is paid her. In the hive, the\r\nutmost solicitude is evinced to satisfy her in every wish; wherever she\r\nmoves the bees anxiously clear away before her, and turn their heads\r\ntowards their sovereign, and with much affection touch her with their\r\nantennæ, and supply her, as often as she needs, with honey or other\r\ndelicacy which their own exertions, or those of their fellow labourers,\r\nhave gathered for her use.\r\n\r\nThe queen-bee is said to live four or five years, and is generally\r\nsucceeded on her throne by one of her own descendants duly brought up\r\nfor the purpose; but in the event of her untimely decease, the workers\r\nhave the power of raising a sovereign from amongst themselves, and\r\nfitting her for the station she is intended to occupy; this they do\r\nby selecting one of the larvæ of the worker-bee of a certain age,\r\nand, enlarging the cell which it is to occupy, supplying it with a\r\nnourishment different from that which they give to the worker and\r\ndrone-brood.\r\n\r\nA _queen-bee_ takes seventeen days to arrive at maturity, that is to\r\nsay, from the egg-state to the fully developed queen, but this period\r\nwill vary as a sudden change of temperature will prolong the interval;\r\nand this also applies to the perfect _queen_ herself, who will not\r\ndeposit her eggs in the cells, when any severe weather happens at the\r\nperiod she may be expected to produce the eggs.\r\n\r\nThe fecundity of the queen-bee is very great, for it is estimated that\r\nduring breeding time, unless prevented by the cold weather, she lays\r\nat the rate of from one hundred to two hundred eggs a day, causing\r\nan increase of not less than eighty thousand worker-bees, and drones\r\nincluded, in a season when circumstances are favourable.\r\n\r\nThe cells formed for the royal brood are very different from those of\r\nthe males or the workers, and are generally suspended from the sides\r\nor edges of the combs; in shape they are very much like a pear, the\r\nthickest end joining the comb, and the small end having the mouth or\r\nentrance to the cell, and hanging downwards, and being almost as large\r\nas a lady's thimble.\r\n\r\nThe _drones_ or _males_ in a hive are computed at from six hundred\r\nto two thousand, but the numbers are remarkably irregular, and the\r\nproportion is not regulated by the number of bees contained in a hive;\r\nfor a small swarm or colony will contain as many, or more sometimes,\r\nthan a large one.\r\n\r\nThe drone may be easily distinguished from the _queen_ or _workers_,\r\nfrom its greater breadth, having large eyes which meet at the top of the\r\nhead, and no sting, and from its making a loud humming whilst flying.\r\n\r\nIt takes twenty-four days from the time of the laying of the drone _egg_\r\nto its coming forth a perfect insect. Drones are generally hatched about\r\nthe end of April or the beginning of May; they venture out of the hive\r\nonly in warm weather, and then only in the middle of the day, and they\r\nare generally expelled by the bees from the hives about July or August,\r\nafter the impregnation of the young queens has taken place.\r\n\r\nWhen the destruction of the drones takes place earlier, it may be\r\nconsidered a certain indication that no swarming will take place during\r\nthat season; but the retention of the drones after August, is a very bad\r\nsign, as the swarm must certainly perish in the winter, unless their\r\nvacant throne is supplied with a prolific queen.\r\n\r\nThe _neuter_ or _worker-bee_, is the least of the three, and of a dark\r\nbrown colour; the abdomen is conical, and composed of six distinct\r\nsegments, and armed with a straight sting; it possesses a long flexible\r\ntrunk, known by the name of a proboscis, and has on its two hinder legs\r\na hollow or basket, to receive the propolis and farina which it collects\r\nas before described.\r\n\r\nThe number of workers in a well-stocked hive is about fifteen thousand\r\nor twenty thousand. Upon them devolves the whole care and labour of the\r\ncolony, to collect pollen, propolis, and honey; to build the combs and\r\nto attend upon the brood or young bees.\r\n\r\nThe _worker-bee_ is short-lived, seldom surviving more than a year, but\r\nthis is more from the toil they have to endure, though it be a labour\r\nof love, and the many risks they run upon each occasion of going out in\r\nsearch of food, &c., from the weather, or their numerous winged enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Sunt quibus ad portas cecidit custodia sorti:\r\n  Inque vicem speculantur aquas et nubila coeli,\r\n  Aut onera accipiunt venientum, aut agmine facto\r\n  Ignavum fucos pecus à præsepibus arcent.\r\n  Fervet opus, redolentque thymo fragrantia mella.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  LONDON:\r\n  Printed by S. & J.
