H. MacDaniels presiding.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: The gavel with which we open this forty-third\r\nannual meeting of the Northern Nut Growers Association has some\r\nhistorical significance. It was made from a pecan tree which grew in the\r\norchard of Mr. Thomas Littlepage in Maryland, near the city of\r\nWashington, and it has been the custom of the Association to open its\r\nmeetings with that gavel.\r\n\r\nThe forty-third meeting of the Northern Nut Growers Association will be\r\nin order. To open the session we will have the presentation of the\r\ncolors. You will all stand, please, and remain standing through the\r\ninvocation. (Colors presented by Boy Scouts and the invocation given by\r\nthe Reverend William Ellis of Rockport.)\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: At this time we will call on Mr. Hilbert Bennett\r\nto bring us greetings from the people of Rockport. Mr. Bennett of\r\nRockport.\r\n\r\n\r\nAddress of Welcome\r\n\r\nHILBERT BENNETT, _Rockport, Ind._\r\n\r\nSome are here that were here in 1935 and 1939. I was on the Citizen's\r\nCommittee in each of those years. It was the purpose of the Citizen's\r\nCommittee to take notice of your coming and to try to make you\r\nappreciate our interest in you and in your coming.\r\n\r\nWhy was I on that Committee in 1935?\r\n\r\nWhy was I on that Committee in 1939?\r\n\r\nWhy am I on that Committee in 1952?\r\n\r\nI will tell you.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy two other young men, somewhat older than I, were young\r\nmen in the same township and somewhat closely located. I knew those boys\r\nand I knew them well. You came to know them and know them well. One of\r\nthose boys was the late Thomas P. Littlepage, a charter member of this\r\nAssociation. It was my good pleasure to teach school with him. We\r\nattended College together. At college we roomed together. We attended\r\nconventions together and were close personal friends. I think I was in\r\nposition to know him and know him well. The other boy was R. L. McCoy.\r\nWe too, were close personal friends. We too, taught school in the same\r\nterritory and contemporary with T. P. Littlepage. Prior to any\r\norganization of the N.N.G.A. I went with these two boys (men by that\r\ntime) on trips of investigation and inspection of certain nut trees\r\nabout which they had heard and which they wanted to examine.\r\n\r\nIf the trees examined met the proper standards, they wanted to use them\r\nin propagation. If not they would pass them up.\r\n\r\nAnother boy somewhat younger than myself and the two above mentioned\r\nboys, joined most heartily into the nut discussions and investigations\r\nand explorations of promising clues. With them he helped to run down\r\nclues when they would hear of a promising prospect. The jungles were\r\nnever too dense, the distance too far, the road too muddy or rough, for\r\nthose three characters to run down in those horse and buggy days, any\r\nprospect in which they were interested. This boy also became a member of\r\nyour most valued organization. I have a special interest in this boy. I\r\nwas, especially closely associated with him and his family. He went to\r\nschool to me. My signature appears on his Common School Diploma. Their\r\nhome was my home whenever I sought to make it so. I was free to come and\r\ngo. I came a lot. Ford Wilkinson, the third character, and I have been\r\nclose friends ever since.\r\n\r\nAnother one of your fine members became a good friend of mine. He came\r\ninto our county and planted a farm to nut trees and nut production. It\r\nis now the largest nut orchard in the county. I am informed that at that\r\ntime it was the largest nut farm of hardy northern varieties in the\r\nworld. I got acquainted with him early and became endeared to him. It\r\nwas none other than the late Harry Weber.\r\n\r\nWhen it became known that you were to meet here in 1935, it was a\r\nnatural sequence that Ford Wilkinson, knowing that I would gladly help\r\nin any way I could and knowing I was his genuine friend saw fit to place\r\nme on the Citizen's Committee. If he had not, I positively would have\r\nclimbed aboard anyway. You couldn't have driven me out with a peeled\r\nhickory club. I was just going to be in on it whether or no.\r\n\r\nWhether I performed well in 1935 or whether he couldn't find any one\r\nelse to serve in my place, I never knew; but he again placed me on the\r\nCommittee in 1939.\r\n\r\nNow here I am in 1952 an old broken down fossil, broken in health, but\r\nnot in spirit, of little consequence to anybody or anything, I am still\r\non the Committee.\r\n\r\nThat answers the question of some of you of why that old man Bennett is\r\nalways on the local committee and that you have wondered if there is no\r\nother person in this whole community that will serve but him. No,\r\nfriends, we have many who would gladly serve and I doubt not that would\r\nserve much more efficiently.\r\n\r\nI have prepared a short \"skit\" that I wish to present.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1st. _Introducing Joan Flick, of Washington, D. C._\r\n\r\nI am a pecan plucked from a small orchard planted by a retired business\r\nman. He had some surplus ground near his premises that was too rough for\r\neasy cultivation. He thought that he would plant it to pecans so that\r\nhis family and his children's families would have nuts for their own use\r\nand pleasure. He took good care of the trees. He fertilized them every\r\nyear and sometimes oftener. In the course of a few years he not only had\r\nmore pecans than all of the families could use, but he sold hundreds of\r\npounds of nuts from these trees. He developed a commercial orchard\r\nunconsciously.\r\n\r\n\r\n2nd. _Palma Smith of Cincinnati, Ohio._\r\n\r\nI am the hican, I have no commercial value of consequence. I demonstrate\r\nthe ability, the interest, the development and the possibilities of\r\nimprovement by the determined efforts of the members of your\r\nassociation. Knowing your ability and determination to make improvements\r\nin nut culture, I have every feeling that in the not too distant future\r\nyou will develop me into a profitable commercial product.\r\n\r\n\r\n3rd. _Sandra Wright of Rockport, Indiana._\r\n\r\nI am the walnut, a most valuable tree for fine fruit and fine timber for\r\nmany uses. I have been noted for my fine grain and my ability to take a\r\nfine polish. Our forefathers immediately found the walnut to be the\r\nchoice timber out of which to build fine furniture, gun stocks, home\r\nfurnishings and many other things that required high grade material. We\r\nhave never lost sight of its significance.\r\n\r\nThin shelled nuts, easily cracked, and hulled out in halves have been\r\ndeveloped. Walnuts will grow almost any where. Originally it was a\r\ncommon forest tree and would continue to be if it had the opportunity.\r\nThere is little danger of the walnut becoming extinct. It is too\r\nvaluable. I suggest that you plant liberally to high grade walnut trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n4th. _Jo Ann Hall of Rockport, Indiana._\r\n\r\nI am the once popular beech under whose folds thousands of picnickers\r\nhave gathered and enjoyed life's most savory and pleasant moments. I\r\nhave built thousands of American homes and farm barns. I have built\r\nthousands of miles of old farm plank fences. I have built car load after\r\ncar load of beautiful, useful and valuable furniture. In the early\r\nperiod of this country I furnished mast for thousands of swine that fed\r\nmany families. I have filled many minor places of usefulness. As sad as\r\nit is to do and as much as I hate to do so, I am now bidding you a last\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\nSelf interest, the slowness of my growth and the impracticability of\r\npropagation of this once valuable tree leaves but one course, that I\r\npass to my reward with the firm hope that the other trees now being\r\ndeveloped, and grown will fill all of the purposes for which I have been\r\nso useful, and fill them with increased usefulness. With this sad but\r\nnecessary adieu, I bid you one and all goodbye.\r\n\r\n\r\n5th. _Pattie Jones of Rockport, Ind._\r\n\r\nI am the oak, the sturdy oak, the king of the forests. I am stout. They\r\nmake beams, spars, sills, fulcrums and what not from me that require\r\nstrength. I grow fairly fast. I came into usefulness as the world came\r\ninto need of heavy timbers.\r\n\r\nI am dainty and refined as well as strong. I am used in making fine\r\nflooring, fine furniture and many other useful things. Please do not\r\ndiscard me from production. Please do not let me pass into oblivion. I\r\nam very very valuable. I deserve to be perpetuated.\r\n\r\n\r\n6th. _Marcia Smith of Cincinnati, Ohio._\r\n\r\nI am a pecan plucked from the tree of a man who in the early years of\r\nhis married life planted pecan trees in unused spots on his farm that\r\nwere unsuitable for cultivation. As the trees grew into nut bearing\r\ntrees his family of children grew. In the October days, with great\r\ngaiety, glee and happiness, the children would gather the fruit of those\r\ntrees. The children grew to maturity and went to the city to work; but\r\nwhen those October days came they returned home and with similar\r\nhappiness as of their youth they gathered the nuts from those trees.\r\nWith pleasure I say I am one of those trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n7th. _Jean Morris, Joyce Morris and Sandra Wright, all of Rockport,\r\nIndiana._\r\n\r\nWe are a group of clusters, the filbert, the pecan and the walnut. We\r\ncame from a nut farm within the bounds of Spencer County. This farm was\r\nplanted and developed by a former enthusiastic member of your wonderful\r\norganization. He spent much time and energy in behalf of your\r\norganization. He developed the largest nut orchard in the county. I\r\nrefer to Harry Weber, who came from a neighboring state and endeared\r\nhimself to this community by his superb manhood, his genial disposition\r\nand his intense interest in his subject matter. We commend his efforts\r\nto others.\r\n\r\n\r\n8th. _Virginia Mae Daming of Rockport, Ind._ She was carrying the former\r\nReports of the N.N.G.A.\r\n\r\nThis cluster is plucked from a \"Tree\" of great magnitude and\r\nsignificance. Today it has its roots firmly set in Rockport, Indiana.\r\nIts branches reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from Canada to\r\nMexico. Its influence is felt throughout the world.\r\n\r\nIts inception was in Spencer County, Indiana, not specifically detailed,\r\nbut in the main, by boys that were reared among the native nut trees of\r\nthis community of which there were many. It was born in the great City\r\nof New York under the care of the late Thomas P. Littlepage, Dr. Wm. C.\r\nDeming, Dr. Robert T. Morris and Prof. John Craig. It was nurtured\r\nthroughout the land of the detailed history you know much more than I.\r\n\r\nIt has had an enormous growth. It is a most meritorious organization.\r\nLanguage will not express the extent of its benefits to humanity and to\r\ncivilization. It adds to the comfort of untold thousands of happy homes.\r\nIt furnishes employment for thousands of people. It furnishes food of\r\nvital importance to many families. It is the main stay in the\r\nmanufacture of all kinds and grades of furniture. It furnishes food for\r\nthought. It keeps the scientific and investigating minds busy in the\r\nconstant development and improvement of its processes and benefits. Its\r\npossibilities are boundless.\r\n\r\nThat this \"Tree\" may continue to grow and develop in the future as it\r\nhas in the past in the interest of humanity and help us to realize its\r\nimportance and help us to continue its forces in accord with nature and\r\nnature's God is my earnest prayer. May God bless you one and all.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: Thank you very much, Mr. Bennett. You have made\r\nus feel most welcome in Rockport, as you have before on two other\r\noccasions. I don't believe that there is any other man who has welcomed\r\nthis organization three times in the same locality.\r\n\r\nWe also thank you for bringing in the trees and the children to greet us\r\non this occasion. It isn't very often that the trees themselves come\r\ninto the assembly room to greet us, and we appreciate your effort in\r\ndoing this for us.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed with the business of the Association.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no record of the members elected to serve on the\r\nnominating committee for this session. As near as we can determine this\r\ncommittee is as follows: Mr. Silvis, Mr. Allen, Mr. Wilkinson, Mr. McKay\r\nand Mr. Gerardi.\r\n\r\nIs there a motion to approve these names?\r\n\r\nThe committee was approved by vote.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: This Committee will bring in a slate of officers\r\nof the Association for the next year at our final business session.\r\n\r\nI will now call for the reports of standing committees. There are eight\r\nof these. The Program Committee. Royal Oakes is the chairman. The fact\r\nthat we are having a meeting indicates the functioning of the Program\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nMR. OAKES: I believe I have nothing to report at this moment. I would\r\nlike to say the other members did a good part of the committee work.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MACDANIELS: We appreciate the part that all of you have played\r\nin arranging these meetings.\r\n\r\nThe Publications Committee, Editorial Section. Dr. Theiss, I believe, is\r\nnot here. Dr. Theiss received the manuscripts and either had them read\r\nor read them himself.\r\n\r\nThe Printing Section of the Publications Committee, Mr. Slate.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: Our proceedings are on the press and probably will be\r\nfinished and in the mail this week.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: The Place of Meeting Committee. Mr. Allaman is the\r\nchairman. In the absence of Mr. Allaman, I present the invitation\r\nsecured by Mr. Salzer, to meet in Rochester, New York in 1953. Their\r\nconvention bureau offers very attractive facilities and the invitation\r\nis seconded by the Mayor, Joseph J. Naylor, the president of the\r\nRochester Convention and Publicity Bureau, the President of the\r\nRochester Hotel Association, the President of the Junior Chamber of\r\nCommerce of Rochester, and the Deputy Commissioner of the Rochester\r\nParks, which just about covers the board.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem to me worthwhile to read all of this material. What it\r\nboils down to is that Rochester would be a very good place to meet. The\r\nRochester parks are very interesing places to go, and as I understand\r\nit, there are facilities which would not be expensive to the\r\nAssociation. Is that true, Mr. Salzer?\r\n\r\nMR. SALZER: Yes, there would be no charge for exhibit rooms if they are\r\nheld in the hotel, because we are classed as a scientific organization.\r\nAnd we would have the facilities of the Bausch Memorial Museum. There\r\nwould be facilities for showing moving pictures or slides, and for an\r\nexhibit.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: It would be in order at the present time to take\r\ndefinite action on this Rochester invitation, if you care to do so. A\r\nmotion would be in order to accept.\r\n\r\nIt has been moved, seconded, and carried that we have our 1953\r\nconvention in the City of Rochester, the dates will be determined by the\r\nBoard of Directors.\r\n\r\nThe general thinking of the Board of Directors is that we will go to\r\nLancaster, Pa. again in 1954, and in 1955 come back into the Middle\r\nWest. Mr. Allaman has been working on the Lancaster proposal and I think\r\nthere has been some spade work done in Michigan already. Have you\r\nanything to say about that, Mr. O'Rourke?\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: We will be very glad to have you at Michigan State College\r\nat any time. Unfortunately, however, we do not have any nut plantings\r\nthere. The nut plantings are either in the eastern part of the state or\r\nthe western part. It's quite a drive either way.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: I don't think we have to make a commitment at this\r\ntime, but it is something to be brought to the attention of the Place of\r\nMeeting Committee.\r\n\r\nI think we might have a little further explanation from Mr. Best about\r\nhis bacon breakfast.\r\n\r\nMR. BEST: We said in our membership drive that anyone who would go out\r\nand work would bring home the bacon, and we further fortified the deal\r\nthat we were going to furnish the bacon here at Rockport at this\r\nsession. So in the morning over at Cotton's restaurant we will have\r\nbacon, all you want to eat, and the only requirement is that you either\r\ngot a member last year in the membership drive we have been working on,\r\nor that you tried to get a member. That's all that's necessary.\r\n\r\nMR. GRAVATT: You have spoken about the meeting in 1954. As you know, I\r\nhave represented this country at the International Chestnut Meeting for\r\ntwo years. There has been some talk about the possibility of the N. N.\r\nG. A. inviting the International Chestnut Meeting to meet in this\r\ncountry in 1954 or '55. At the last meeting the delegates from Japan\r\nrecommended that they meet in the United States in 1954. The matter is\r\nnot decided, and I think if you will put off decision about Lancaster\r\nuntil later, it would be a little better.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: The committee on Standards and Judging, Mr.\r\nSpencer Chase.\r\n\r\nMR. SPENCER CHASE: Mr. President, we contemplated having a report on\r\nhickory standards for this meeting, but because of circumstances beyond\r\nour control, we didn't get the project under way.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: I will call on our secretary at this time for the\r\nreport of the meeting of the directors.\r\n\r\nMR. McDANIEL: There were several things brought up last night at the\r\nmeeting of the Board of Directors of the Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation. One matter was the subscription to the American Fruit\r\nGrower magazine which we give our membership.\r\n\r\nThe American Fruit Grower had been selling subscriptions to the\r\nAssociation for its members at 30 cents a year. Since the first of July\r\nthis year their rate is 50 cents. The opinion of the directors and\r\ncommittee members present last night was that we should drop that\r\nsubscription to the American Fruit Grower for our members. It will be\r\nsent to all members who join for this year and up to the beginning of\r\nthe next fiscal year. After October 1st, no subscriptions to the\r\nAmerican Fruit Grower through the Association. Do we have any discussion\r\non this proposal? (Considerable discussion followed.)\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: I suggest that we hear the report of the Board of\r\nDirectors and then act on the various items one by one in executive\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nMR. McDANIEL: You have heard something about the membership drive, and\r\nwe will have more on that later. The directors suggested that we\r\nencourage more memberships, contributing memberships and sustaining\r\nmemberships in the Association at $5.00 and $10.00 per year. Some of us\r\nfeel we can't pay any more than $3.00 for our membership; others will be\r\nable to support the organization financially by taking memberships at\r\nthe $5.00 or $10.00 rate, and we are still offering our life membership\r\nat $75.00.\r\n\r\nAnother matter discussed was offering the set of 34 volumes of back\r\nreports in The Nutshell at the price of $20.00 for the 34 volumes now\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nWe suggest also that the Association authorize the appointment of a\r\nPublicity Committee to work with the Membership Committee in attracting\r\nnew members.\r\n\r\nThat is about all I have as the report of the directors' meeting last\r\nnight, Mr. President.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: This matter of the Board of Directors reporting to\r\nthe business session is a pattern which I think is a good one. The\r\nproposition has been placed before you as to whether or not you wish to\r\ncontinue our affiliation with the American Fruit Grower magazine. As you\r\nwill recall, the reason the question comes up at the present time is\r\nthat they have raised their rate from 30 cents a member to 50 cents a\r\nmember, which is 50 cents of our $3.00, which with the 50 cents\r\nsecretarial expenses leaves but $2.00 to run the society. As the\r\nTreasurer will explain to you later, we are in somewhat of a financial\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nIt has been moved and seconded that the Association subscription to the\r\nAmerican Fruit Grower be discontinued.\r\n\r\nThis matter is up for discussion.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: We have much more space available in The Nutshell than in\r\nthe American Fruit Grower, and there is the possibility of more frequent\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nMR. DOWELL: If we could actually get it bi-monthly or quarterly, in\r\nplace of the Fruit Grower, I think most all of us would be better\r\ninformed and actually have more information. And The Nutshell is a very\r\nexcellent means of showing somebody what the organization is about. You\r\ngive them a copy of the American Fruit Grower, and if he is interested\r\nin nuts, most copies aren't going to convince him of much.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: I think this question is related to the\r\nappointment of a Publicity Committee which will explore what can be\r\ndone to secure more publicity and give more information about nuts to\r\nour members than has been possible in the Fruit Grower.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Board of Directors felt that $300-plus is a high\r\nprice to pay for what we got out of The American Fruit Grower.\r\n\r\n(The question was called for.)\r\n\r\nThe motion is passed without dissent.\r\n\r\nThe question of authorizing the appointment of a Publicity Committee is\r\nintroduced mainly as a matter for your information, also because it's\r\nmuch better if the society as such were to authorize such a committee.\r\nDo I hear such a motion?\r\n\r\nMoved by Mr. Salzer, seconded by Colby and passed that the appointment\r\nof a Publicity Committee be approved.\r\n\r\nI will ask for the report of the Treasurer, Mr. Prell.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreasurer's Report\r\n\r\nMR. PRELL: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Best has asked that I\r\nhelp in connection with his report. That certainly is not because I can\r\nmake his report better than he can, but probably because a new member is\r\nnot a new member until his check has arrived and has been recorded, and\r\nI happen to have those figures. I will be happy to do that, but perhaps\r\nwe should start first with the report that the President has asked for,\r\nthe Treasurer's report.\r\n\r\nI imagine that you are uninterested in an itemized, detailed report of\r\nreceipts and expenditures; I imagine you are interested in the question:\r\nHow are we doing? We are not doing too well. The annual report for this\r\nyear indicates that our financial condition is not satisfactory. For the\r\nsecond successive year we have spent more money than we have taken in,\r\nand that would be the third successive year, if it hadn't been for the\r\nfact that due to the lateness of the publication in 1950--that it, the\r\nannual report--we did not pay for an annual report that year. That means\r\nthere are three years in a row that we have gone downhill.\r\n\r\nThe picture is not entirely black, however. There are some bright spots.\r\nFor instance, all our bills are paid. Second, we have money in the bank.\r\nThird, our $3,000 investment in Government bonds is still intact, and\r\nfourth, our deficit this year was less than it was last year, which may\r\nindicate that we have already touched bottom and are starting up.\r\n\r\nThe cause of our deficit is easy to put your finger on. We are operating\r\non budgets that are ten years old, and costs have gone way, way beyond.\r\nDues were increased several years ago, but even at that time they were\r\nnot increased adequately, and since then costs have skyrocketed.\r\n\r\nThe membership situation is not too bad, though the cost situation is\r\nbad. The two don't jibe at all. The reason we have a lesser deficit this\r\nyear than last is Mr. Best's work and the work of his vice-presidents in\r\nincreasing the membership, and the results of that work; I think, have\r\nonly begun to show.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we came within $417 of collecting enough money this year\r\nto pay our expenses. It was over $500 last year, making a total of a\r\nthousand dollars that we have spent above our receipts. While we have\r\nsome money in the bank, there will be a bill due in about 30 days on the\r\npublication of the annual report, that will be mailed within the next\r\nfew days. And that will take all the money that is in the bank, plus\r\nwhat we are able to collect in dues immediately, and I hope that many of\r\nthem are paid at once. But that still leaves us without money to operate\r\nthrough the year, and by January, unless conditions change, we will be\r\nborrowing money.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Directors has discussed this. They have some thoughts on\r\nthe subject which will be presented to you by Dr. MacDaniels. I think\r\nthat one of the obvious things that you all think of and I may mention\r\nis the matter of increased membership. That's an obvious solution, and\r\nas I said a minute ago, it's a very possible solution.\r\n\r\nThe work that was started by Mr. Best last February is only now\r\nbeginning to bear fruit. New memberships, even as late as this for this\r\nyear, in August, are coming in very, very well. I personally see no\r\nreason why the membership cannot be increased to a thousand members next\r\nyear, providing all of us bring in a member or two.\r\n\r\nI asked a friend of mine on The Country Gentleman for some data on state\r\npopulation compared to farm population. I forget just exactly now how it\r\nruns on various states, but I do recall Indiana. We have a population\r\nhere of four million people. There are about 700,000 of these people on\r\n166,000 farms. The farms in this state produce a wealth of $75,000,000 a\r\nyear. With 700,000 farmers in this state and population of 4,000,000\r\nwith a wealth of $75,000,000 a year, it would seem to me that the State\r\nof Indiana should have more than only 39 members. Out of that group we\r\nshould certainly increase that ten times. We should have 400 members,\r\nand if the same proportion is carried throughout the nation, why, this\r\norganization can easily obtain a roll of 7500 to 10,000 members. A\r\nthousand members next year should be a pushover. So much for the\r\nfinancial report.\r\n\r\nMr. Best's campaign started last February. His vice-presidents were\r\ngiven material and the inspiration to work for new members, and they\r\nresponded. For Mr. Best I compiled the list of the new members who have\r\nbeen brought in, with the people who have brought in the greatest\r\nnumber, but that thing went galley-west in the last few days by the\r\nstrong finishers. Mr. Best himself came in yesterday with a pocket full\r\nof 11 new members, and he already had a couple on the list. Up to that\r\ntime--and I am not giving credit to the Secretary, because several of\r\nthe members that show his sponsorship have come naturally through his\r\noffice. So disregarding the sponsored members of the Secretary, Spencer\r\nChase was top man, up until Mr. Best upset him yesterday, followed by\r\nDr. Rohrbacher, who was a late finisher with members who were not\r\nrecorded in this report. All through the year it was a battle between\r\nPennsylvania and Illinois as to who would have the greater number of\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nIllinois, with 36 members, hopped up to 60, and Mr. Best's 11 make 71.\r\nAnd just this morning they got two others from Illinois, making 73. So I\r\nthink Illinois has the second place position firmly nailed down.\r\n\r\nLast year we had 563 members all together. This year now we have 170\r\nnew members. We can't add that to 563, because in every organization\r\nthere is a loss of membership every year, and it's to be expected that\r\nour membership should have a 10 per cent turnover through circumstances\r\nof people leaving their places where they have their nut tree plantings,\r\ndeaths and other circumstances. So there was a net gain of 86 members to\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n                             TREASURER'S REPORT\r\n\r\n                     August 25, 1951 to August 18, 1952\r\n\r\n   RECEIPTS\r\n\r\n     Membership Dues                                           $1,907.00\r\n     Sales of Annual Reports                                      190.00\r\n     Interest on U.

It's only a matter of every person getting a couple, or like\r\nSpencer Chase getting 10. That would put us well toward our goal of a\r\nthousand members, on which the Association probably can operate without\r\ndeficit. I thank you. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: Thank you very much, Mr. Prell. We are very much\r\nindebted to you for your business-like handling of the affairs of the\r\nsociety. It is sometimes bitter to know the facts, but the only way that\r\nwe are ever going to get anywhere is by knowing the facts and facing\r\nthem. Either fortunately or unfortunately we are not like the federal\r\ngovernment, which can go on piling up deficits. We have to do as each\r\none of us as individuals has to do: If our operating-expense exceeds\r\nincome, we either have to get more income or cease out-go. That is the\r\nsituation under which we are confronted at the present time.\r\n\r\nA little later we can take up some of the things we have in mind. Did\r\nyou have a further report, Mr. Secretary?\r\n\r\nI think probably the Treasurer stole some of the thunder that you might\r\notherwise have.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: He did that, and the Membership Committee also. You know\r\nsomething of the activities of the secretary's office during the current\r\nyear, a matter of getting out three issues of The Nutshell and assisting\r\nwith the editing of the annual report, which I hope you will receive\r\nabout the time you get home.\r\n\r\nOne other activity in which the Secretary participated, in addition to\r\nthe usual task of answering letters to beginning nut growers, was this\r\nproject \"Things of Science\". Perhaps Dr. McKay could tell us more about\r\nthat. Is Dr. McKay in the room? Will you come up now?\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: We being near Washington, were, of course, the logical people\r\nto come in contact with this suggestion early when it was made. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the very beginning of this movement goes back to Harry\r\nDengler. Some of you may know of him. He is Extension Forester at the\r\nUniversity of Maryland and is also Secretary of the American Holly\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nHarry Dengler was very much interested in this \"Things of Science\"\r\nprogram and happened to mention to the Science Service paper, of which\r\nWatson Davis is editor, that it would be a desirable thing to work up a\r\ntest on nuts.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those of you who do not know what \"Things of Science\"\r\nis, it is a movement sponsored by Science Service, located in\r\nWashington, D. C, whereby 12,000 subscribers to \"Things of Science\"\r\nreceive every month a little kit through the mails dealing with all\r\nkinds of subjects in science. It is usually a little box, as in the case\r\nof the one on nuts, or it may be simply an envelope with some things in\r\nit to taste. The idea is to give people all over the country who are\r\ninterested enough to pay $5.00 a year one kit a month, each one dealing\r\nwith a different phase of science.\r\n\r\nMany groups subscribe to this service; for instance a boy scout troop,\r\nlibraries and industrial plants. So it goes to literally many thousands\r\nmore people than the 12,000 actual subscribers that it has.\r\n\r\nSo when Science Service came to us and said, \"Would you be interested in\r\nhelping us work up a kit on nuts\", naturally, we wanted to do what we\r\ncould towards helping these people, and our first thought was this\r\norganization as an official sponsor for it. So we contacted the\r\ndirectors, the officers, Dr. MacDaniels and J. C. McDaniel, and as a\r\nresult, the Northern Nut Growers, through its board of directors,\r\nbecause we had no other means to authorize it, went ahead and sponsored\r\nthis move.\r\n\r\nTo do it, we approached the California Walnut Growers Association, the\r\nCalifornia Almond Growers Association, the Northwest Nut Growers\r\nAssociation, and the Southeastern Pecan Growers Association, with the\r\nidea of having their names mentioned in the kit, and in return they\r\nwould furnish samples to distribute. The Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation furnished the hickory nut samples. The kit was composed of,\r\nas I recall, six different kinds of nuts--Persian walnuts and almonds\r\nfrom California, filberts from the Northwest, Pecans from the Southeast,\r\nhickory nuts from the Northern Nut Growers Association, and pistachio\r\nnuts furnished through the Department of Agriculture by Captain\r\nWhitehouse at Beltsville. He secured the pistachio nuts from the trees\r\nin California. The kit was composed of a little box about four inches\r\nlong, an inch and a half deep and three inches wide, containing two or\r\nmore nuts of the various kinds, together with a brochure that we helped\r\nthe science people work up. Dr. MacDaniels and the various cooperating\r\ngroups worked up this brochure of information. The kits include a set of\r\ndirections for the subscriber to follow in using the material. There are\r\nseveral different possibilities, all along the lines of scientific\r\nexperimentation.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to get these youngsters and young people to become familiar\r\nwith different kinds of nuts.\r\n\r\nI think that's all I should say, Mr. President. That covers pretty well\r\nthe effort that was made and those who made the effort. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: Thank you very much, Dr. McKay. This project is\r\none in which there were deadlines as to time, and we had to work rather\r\nfast. Air mail, special delivery, the long distance telephone and\r\ntelegraph played quite a part in it. The Science Service was paying the\r\ncost of assembling and mailing. The only cost to the Association was for\r\nthe hickory nuts.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: We were late on that and unable to get the quality nuts we\r\nwould like, but we did get enough to fill the kits, not all of which\r\nwere worthy.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: We would like to have secured Carpathian walnuts,\r\nbut the nuts from known sources of supply were so discolored with husk\r\nmaggot that we were ashamed to send them out. We were not able to locate\r\nand to furnish any considerable amount of any kind of northern nuts.\r\nTwelve thousand of these kits went out, and each one of them is in a\r\nposition where it probably contacted a dozen or more on the average, so\r\nthat I am sure as a result of the effort a great many people not only\r\nbecame more familiar with nuts and their various sources and uses, but\r\nalso learned that the contest was sponsored by the Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation. Mr. Prell, who knows something about advertising, thought\r\nit was a very worthwhile project.\r\n\r\nThat completes the reports of the officers and of the committees. We\r\nwill now take ten minutes recess.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: The session will be in order.\r\n\r\nAs your treasurer said, there are several other things which we\r\ndiscussed in the directors' meeting. We discussed this matter of how,\r\nthe situation being such as it is, the Association could improve its\r\nposition through gaining more members and through either making more\r\nmoney or cutting down expenditures.\r\n\r\nThe Publicity Committee was one of those suggestions, who were to\r\nexplore this matter of getting better publicity for less money. That is,\r\nwhatever publicity we got from the American Fruit Grower cost us about\r\n$300, and we think we can do a lot better in some other way.\r\n\r\nAnother matter was to place the financial situation of the society\r\nsquarely before the membership and ask that as many as could and felt so\r\ninclined take out a contributing or a sustaining membership. We felt\r\nquite strongly that raising the dues was not the answer, because there\r\nare a lot of people sort of on the fringe who don't work too actively\r\nfor the society but who do take out regular memberships but who, if we\r\nraised the dues even another 50 cents, would probably fail to renew\r\ntheir memberships. So that at least for the present we are not going to\r\ngo ahead on that basis, unless you want that to come up for further\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nAnother point which we, I think, should explore was the matter of\r\nadvertising in the proceedings. Some other associations, the pecan\r\nassociation, particularly, as Dr. McKay pointed out, make a substantial\r\npart of their revenue from advertising in the proceedings. We have tried\r\nthat before, but times have changed, and I think it should be considered\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThen the matter of speeding up sales of sets of the proceedings to\r\nlibraries, that is, further publicity in The Nutshell about sets that\r\nare for sale and, perhaps, circularizing the library lists to sell\r\ncomplete sets, or as complete as we have.\r\n\r\nAnother matter that might be explored is having some kind of a\r\n\"give-away program\", some inducement for those who take out memberships\r\nfor the first time. Other societies do it in one way or another.\r\nUnfortunately, our material does not lend itself to that sort of thing\r\nas well as some others, but we might be able to give nuts of Carpathian\r\nstrains that could be used as seed nuts, or perhaps the hybrid hazels.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: One suggestion made in a letter from Dr. Crane was to\r\ndistribute hybrid walnuts to grow to fruiting size. That might be\r\nexplored if there is a source of enough seedlings or seed nuts of\r\nJuglans Regia crossed with Juglans Nigra.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: We would welcome any further suggestions which you\r\nmay have, either as to saving money or making money, or increasing our\r\nmembership, which amounts to making money, of course.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that might be done to present the possibilities of nut\r\ngrowing to your communities is to sponsor exhibits at your own county or\r\nstate fairs.\r\n\r\nMr. Slate wanted to make a comment along these lines.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: That matter of urging sustaining and contributing memberships\r\nhas been mentioned by you. I think it would be one of the best things\r\nwe could do to send a statement of our financial condition to the\r\nmembers of the Association pointing out the need for additional funds\r\nand suggesting that all who can possibly afford it take out sustaining\r\nand contributing memberships. It seems to me that this is just about the\r\nonly alternative to increasing the dues. I am not sure whether an\r\nincrease in the dues would result in the loss of many members or not.\r\nPerhaps they are getting rather used to the higher price level, and it\r\nmight be well to have an expression of opinion from some of those here\r\nas to whether they thought there would be serious objections to an\r\nincrease in the dues. Surely, there are many who can afford to carry\r\nsustaining or contributing memberships.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: That is the opinion of the Board of Directors. Mr.\r\nSlate has raised a question as to the validity of the conclusion of the\r\nDirectors regarding the advisability of raising the dues. Our thinking\r\nwas that to raise the dues beyond the present level would result in\r\nsufficient loss of membership to offset any gain in revenue. The last\r\ntime we raised the dues what was the effect?\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: When we raised the dues to $3.00 we had a membership of\r\n650. It dropped to about 580; a loss of 60 or 70.\r\n\r\nMR. PRELL: We in effect raised dues 50 cents this morning. It won't\r\naffect new members, but it may cause some of the older ones who are\r\nmembers to drop. They know that at present 50 cents of their dues are\r\ngoing to the Fruit Grower; now they aren't getting the Fruit Grower.\r\n\r\nMR. MACHOVINA: They were getting for $2.50 what they will now get for\r\n$3.00.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MACDANIELS: Any other discussion?\r\n\r\nMR. KINTZEL: I have given this problem of increasing the membership\r\nquite a bit of thought, and have an idea which might be used. Let's see\r\nby a show of hands how many live in the city but own farms outside of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: The question is how many live in the city but have\r\nfarms outside. Sixteen or 17, probably about 20.\r\n\r\nMR. KINTZEL: You might call me a city farmer. Like many other city\r\npeople, I own a small farm near the city in which I live, which is\r\nCincinnati, Ohio. I am intensely interested in the work of the N.N.G.A.\r\nThere must be many others who, too, are owners of land but who use the\r\nland for experimental farming and to get a little diversion from the\r\ndaily grind in the busy, noisy city. These people would consider it a\r\nfavor to have their attention called to the interesting work of our\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nA practical plan for getting in touch with this reservoir of future\r\nmembers is to secure the names and addresses of such land owners from\r\nthe records at the various county court houses fringing the cities. A\r\npersonal letter should be written to these future members. A friendly\r\ninvitation to join the N.N.G.A. should be extended, and a printed\r\nbrochure describing and explaining its work and objects should be\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\nI believe that by working systematically on the city dweller, who also\r\nowns acreage outside the city limits, we could give our membership list\r\na big boost.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: That is a good suggestion for the Membership\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nIs there anything further?\r\n\r\nMR. CALDWELL: This is not a suggestion, but a comment following up the\r\nidea of the previous speaker. In Syracuse there was a woman with an\r\nestimated 160 acres of land, who about 15 or 16 years ago became\r\ninterested in planting hybrid chestnuts. Unfortunately, the land was not\r\nsuitable for raising chestnuts and the two or three hundred trees she\r\nplanted failed to grow. I don't think there are two alive there now. So\r\nyou will have to be a little bit careful in encouraging city people to\r\nplant nut trees. She spent a lot of money and right now if you mention\r\nthat, she will just practically tear you apart. She wasted money and\r\ntime, so be careful in getting people going too strong unless you are\r\nsure the trees are going to grow for them.\r\n\r\nMR. SNYDER: According to the chart outside, cutting off the Fruit Grower\r\nwill leave us just a few cents per member in the red.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: Right.\r\n\r\nMR. SNYDER: Well, don't we have $3,000 in bonds? What are they for, if\r\nit isn't to tide us over a hard period like this?\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: That is a suggestion for the Board of Directors.\r\n\r\nMR. SNYDER: If inflation keeps up, the bonds will be worth nothing. We\r\nmight as well use them up. I would suggest we use every method to\r\nbalance the budget without them, but if necessary, use some of them up.\r\nIf it is necessary, use the bonds to balance the budget.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: The question of whether or not we use the bonds, I\r\nthink, would have to be considered very carefully. I think one of the\r\nOhio men has a suggestion.\r\n\r\nMR. DOWELL: This discussion would follow along with that on membership.\r\nThe active members of the Ohio section were organized back in 1946, and\r\nin 1948 the national body put in its by-laws a provision that there\r\ncould be state sections formed. That is Article 1 and also Article 2,\r\nthat you could have affiliated bodies. Now, as far as I know, there is\r\nno other state section.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: Michigan has one, now.\r\n\r\nMR. DOWELL: Michigan has not actually affiliated yet, and when it does\r\ncome in it will be an affiliated society. According to the by-laws it\r\nwill not be necessary for all its members to be members of the N. N. G.\r\nA.\r\n\r\nNow, we feel that some strong state section is the main support in\r\nmembership interest and a lot of other lines, and I think that if you\r\ncheck the rolls you will find where you have had a state organization,\r\nwhether it's affiliated or otherwise, particularly Ohio and Michigan,\r\nthat our membership has not really dropped down in total numbers. Of\r\ncourse, there is a turnover every year. If it has dropped down, it's\r\nbeen slight in comparison with the overall drop down.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: Ohio is only holding its own now. You have one more member\r\nthan you had a year ago.\r\n\r\nMR. DOWELL: That's right, we are holding our own, and previous to this\r\nlast run, the total number in the Association was down a hundred. That\r\nhas not dropped in Ohio, which has the state section. Neither has it\r\nrecently in Michigan, which has recently organized the Michigan Nut\r\nGrowers.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Committee of the Ohio section wishes to present the\r\nfollowing resolution for the consideration of this body:\r\n\r\nRESOLUTION\r\n\r\n     \"WHEREAS we feel that membership in a state section has been a\r\n     definite advantage in maintaining and increasing membership in the\r\n     National Organization, as has been demonstrated in the Ohio Section\r\n     of the N. N. G. A.;\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS a National Organization becomes strong because of its\r\n     strong local sections which help maintain interest;\r\n\r\n     THEREFORE the National Organization should encourage and foster the\r\n     formation of local sections.\r\n\r\n     We therefore submit the following motion: That the N. N. G. A.\r\n     amend its constitution to provide for the organization of local\r\n     sections. These amendments should include the following provisions:\r\n\r\n     1. Membership in the N. N. G. A. shall be a requirement for full\r\n     membership in the local section; however this shall not exclude\r\n     local sections from accepting associate members.\r\n\r\n     2. That each member of the N. N. G. A. shall automatically become a\r\n     member of a local section when he resides in a location where a\r\n     recognized local section exists.\r\n\r\n     3. Wherever a local section has become established, the local\r\n     chairman shall serve as vice president of the N. N. G. A. for that\r\n     area.\r\n\r\n     4. The N. N. G. A. shall refund to the treasurer of each local\r\n     section ten percent (10%) of the N. N. G. A. dues paid annually by\r\n     members of that section.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: I conclude that you are presenting this for the\r\nconsideration of the Association. It would be an amendment to the\r\nby-laws, I take it, rather than the constitution. Such an amendment\r\nwould have to come up for consideration at the next meeting after\r\nconsideration by the Board of Directors; either that, or else vote on it\r\nby mail.\r\n\r\nMR. DOWELL: It is purely a motion now, if passed or rejected. But if it\r\nis passed, then previous to the Rochester meeting, the proposal would\r\nhave to be in a suitable form to be either passed or rejected for the\r\nby-laws.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: We have this resolution in printed form. That will\r\nbe transmitted to the Board of Directors for consideration at the next\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nMR. DOWELL: We make it as a motion that the mass accept or reject it\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: The motion is, then, to accept the resolution and\r\npresent it to the Board of Directors. Is that right? Is there a second?\r\n\r\nMR. KINTZEL: I second it.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: Are there further remarks? If not, all in favor,\r\nsignify by saying \"Aye.\" (Chorus of \"ayes\"). Opposed? (None.) It is\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: I am very sorry I was not recognized before the vote was\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: I am sorry.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: I am speaking, I think, for the Michigan Nut Growers, of\r\nwhich we have quite a group here today, and we are quite anxious to\r\nmaintain an independent state organization. We feel that it is perfectly\r\nall right for this motion to have been adopted as it has been, if there\r\nwill be no attempt made to delete that section which now refers to\r\naffiliation.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: I think there would be no attempt to do that.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: Is that clearly understood that there will be no attempt\r\nmade to delete the section on affiliation?\r\n\r\nMR. DOWELL: That is the understanding. Now, there are two ways in the\r\npresent by-laws. Now, this would either be a third or replace the first.\r\nIt would have nothing to do with affiliating groups.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: I think that is right, and I think the thing to\r\ndo, Mr. Dowell, would be to be sure that the new president is apprized\r\nof the Michigan point of view in that regard. He will be the chairman of\r\nthe new Board of Directors, and this is simply a motion to consider it.\r\nIt doesn't go any further than that.\r\n\r\nIs there any further business to come before this group at this time? If\r\nnot, the other item on the agenda, as it is stated, I believe, is a\r\npresidential address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Forward Look\r\n\r\nPresidential Address, by L. H. MacDaniels\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the retiring president of our Association, it is a time honored\r\ncustom and a privilege to give what is often referred to as the\r\npresidential address. I do not have in mind giving an address but rather\r\nto consider with you informally the present situation of the Northern\r\nNut Growers Association and to give my ideas as to what we might do to\r\nimprove our position and forward the purposes for which the Association\r\nwas organized in 1910.\r\n\r\nTime does not permit recounting the history of the development of the\r\nAssociation. This has been done on several previous occasions. I will,\r\nhowever, go back to the 1945 report in which under the title \"Where Do\r\nWe Go from Here\" I tried to pick up various aspects of the condition of\r\nthe Association immediately following the war and point out areas to\r\nwhich special attention should be given at that time.\r\n\r\nConsidering our situation in 1952, it appears that many of our problems\r\nare about the same as they were in 1945 although in some areas definite\r\nprogress has been made. A quick look at our problems then and now is\r\nperhaps pertinent to the present discussion. One of these is variety\r\nevaluation. This still remains one of the important areas where we need\r\nmuch more information particularly as to the success or failure of\r\ndifferent named clones of nut trees in various regions. Perhaps it is\r\ntime for us to carefully summarize whatever data we have accumulated as\r\nto the adaptation of varieties or at least make plans for extending a\r\nprogram of evaluation. Since 1945 our survey committees have been active\r\nand have secured information that will certainly be helpful.\r\n\r\nThe problem of judging standards has been clarified somewhat. It is my\r\npersonal opinion that the judging schedule for varieties of black\r\nwalnuts worked out with the assistance of Dr. S. S. Atwood is on a sound\r\nbasis and might well receive much wider use. Following along somewhat\r\nthe same pattern, suggested schedules have been proposed for the\r\nhickories and butternuts. These should receive further consideration and\r\nadoption, if approved at least on a tentative basis. A schedule for\r\nPersian walnuts is very much needed as indicated by the recent contest\r\nin which confusion occurred related to there being no recognized\r\nstandards of evaluation. With the Persian walnut such matters as the\r\nmethod of cracking and the importance of such characters as sealing of\r\nnuts, recovery of whole halves and others should be agreed upon.\r\n\r\nOur procedure in naming varieties is still somewhat chaotic. Possibly we\r\nshould adopt the general pattern of the American Pomological Society.\r\nTheir example of setting up an approved list of varieties for planting\r\non a regional basis is worthy of consideration. Even though such a list\r\nwere tentative and incomplete, a start which would embody the best\r\ninformation we have would be valuable.\r\n\r\nSecuring new varieties of, hardy nut trees through breeding has made\r\nsome progress. Most encouraging is the work of the Federal Experiment\r\nStation at Beltsville where Doctor Crane and Doctor McKay and their\r\nassociates are using modern techniques in securing new varieties of\r\nhardy nut trees. Some progress in hybridization, of course, has been\r\nmade, particularly with the filberts, the hybrids developed by J. F.\r\nJones, G. L. Slate, S. H. Graham, Heben Corsan and some others, showing\r\ngreat improvement over previous European varieties in their adaptability\r\nto the northern United States. At the present time there are filbert\r\nvarieties of hybrid origin better than those in the nursery trade which\r\nshould be propagated and made available. Work with the Chinese chestnuts\r\nhas also been valuable.\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion, which I believe is shared by most of those who are\r\nfamiliar with progress in securing new varieties, that we are not likely\r\nto find in the wild, varieties or clones which show any marked\r\nimprovement over those already found and named. There is, of course,\r\nalways the possibility of the \"perfect nut\" arising as a chance\r\nvariation. The recent walnut and hickory contests, however, have been\r\nsomewhat disappointing for they have not discovered any variety of black\r\nwalnut better than the Thomas for instance, or a hickory much better\r\nthan some of those located years ago. This does not mean that members of\r\nthe Association should not keep a sharp lookout for new varieties\r\noccurring spontaneously which will be better than existing sorts. It\r\ndoes mean, however, that if real \"breaks\" are to be secured, it will be\r\nnecessary to apply some of the more effective techniques which are known\r\nin the plant breeding field. Any such program is a long time project and\r\ncan only be effectively attempted by experiment stations, or by some of\r\nthe young men, who begin now to make crosses under the direction or at\r\nleast with the advice of those who are familiar with plant breeding\r\ntechniques.\r\n\r\nProgress has been made in the Association organization. The constitution\r\nhas been thoroughly overhauled and amended, particularly to provide for\r\nregional groups. Certainly such groups are to be encouraged and have\r\ndone and will do much to strengthen the national organization in the\r\nvarious states. It is my personal opinion that these regional groups can\r\nbe of particular value in working with the experiment stations and\r\nlegislatures to promote the interests of the Association. The state\r\nassociations should be on the alert to build on the interests of\r\nconservation departments as related to wildlife preserves and\r\nsportsmen's clubs and other agencies which put the growing of nut trees\r\nin proper perspective. I am not at all in favor of securing either\r\nfederal or state support for every minor project which comes along.\r\nHowever, the Northern Nut Growers Association need make no apologies for\r\nits program, particularly as it is related to the conservation of our\r\nnatural resources; to the promotion of better living on the farm and\r\nthose values which are real and great, even though they do not show up\r\nlarge in dollar value of crops produced.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, projects in nut growing have been started in various\r\nstates, particularly Ohio and Michigan only to be eliminated before they\r\nreally got under way because of lack of support. Experiment station\r\ndirectors, if they are confronted with a shortage of funds, are likely\r\nto run the blue pencil through items which cannot be backed up with\r\neconomic considerations. The approach of the Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation it seems to me should not be to seek support on an economic\r\nbasis but rather on the basis of better living on the farm, improvement\r\nof gardens and farmsteads and the advantages of growing nut trees as\r\ncompared with any other horticultural activity. There has been a real\r\nincrease in the importance which is given to this approach in recent\r\ntimes and an active state association, which can keep in touch with\r\nlocal conditions and call on the national association for additional\r\nsupport, will certainly be of great assistance in the future.\r\n\r\nI personally am not in favor of any sort of a set up by which the\r\nnational association gives a kick back of national dues to a regional\r\nassociation. The dues are inadequate for the national association at the\r\npresent time. Looking at the whole situation with some perspective, it\r\nwould seem that the regional associations might contribute to the\r\nnational association rather than the reverse. If the constitution and\r\nby-laws of the Association are not such as to make affiliation with the\r\nnational association and the formation of regional associations easy,\r\nthey can readily be changed to secure the very best pattern that can be\r\ndevised.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most acute problems with which the Association is\r\nfaced is the struggle to keep financially solvent. We are all aware of\r\nour changing economy, particularly the increased costs of printing and\r\nin fact of everything that our organization uses or needs, even postage.\r\nIn my thinking, the finances of the Association are much the same as\r\nthose of an individual, who is confronted with expenditures that exceed\r\nhis income. The things that have to be done are obvious and the same in\r\nboth cases. One is to spend less and the other is to secure more funds.\r\nIn the judgment of your directors and executive committee, expenditures\r\nhave been reduced as low as is safe in order to keep a going\r\norganization. Members join the Association for the value which they get\r\nout of it and a large part of this value is in the form of reports,\r\nnewsletters, information made available and the organization of annual\r\nmeetings. If these services were discontinued or curtailed, membership\r\nfalls off. This has been the experience of other plant societies, of\r\nwhich there are many.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment retrenchment is not the answer in the present situation.\r\nSecuring additional funds is the best forward-looking policy. The\r\nquestion comes up as to how this may be done. Experience in our\r\nAssociation and I believe other associations as well, has shown that\r\n$3.00 is about as far as dues can be raised. There comes a point with\r\nevery society when, if the dues are increased, there is a falling off of\r\nmembership, which more than offsets the gain. Other obvious procedures\r\nare: (1) increasing the number of members; (2) providing different types\r\nof memberships to encourage larger contributions; (3) gifts; and (4)\r\nspecial fund raising projects. Of these various ways and means,\r\ncertainly increasing the number of members is by far the more promising.\r\nThe overhead of the association is not increased with additional\r\nmemberships anywhere near in proportion to the contributions of those\r\nmembers. This is particularly true for additional copies of the report\r\nand general office expense. The drive for new members under President\r\nBest's leadership has produced gratifying results and I believe if this\r\nis continued effectively through the next few years, a membership\r\nincrease can be secured that will assure the Association's balancing its\r\nbudget. Somewhere in the neighborhood of a thousand paid memberships\r\nwould solve most of our financial difficulties. Provision is already\r\nmade for different types of memberships and it is to be hoped that many\r\nwho can do so will join the contributing member class at least until we\r\nare out of our present financial woods.\r\n\r\nOther societies raise considerable revenue through special projects such\r\nas the sale of publications of one kind or another, seed distribution or\r\nslide rental. The type of material with which the Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation deals is not comparable to some of these other organizations\r\nbut certainly the possibilities of revenue through special projects need\r\nto be explored.\r\n\r\nResearch with northern nut trees is exceedingly important from the\r\nstandpoint of accomplishing the objectives of the Association. The\r\nmatter of breeding new varieties has already been touched on. Other\r\ntypes of research are such that a large part must be carried on by\r\nexperiment stations which have a continuing program. Much has been done\r\nin securing observational information by Association members themselves\r\nbut some problems are such that they must be continued over a long\r\nperiod of time and set up with adequate checks and provision for\r\nsecuring significant data. Otherwise the results are of no real value.\r\nGranted we need all the sound observational experience that all the\r\nmembers can bring to our problems, there are still aspects of culture of\r\nnorthern nut trees that need continuing program of scientific research.\r\n\r\nFortunately, much of the cultural information secured with nut crops of\r\neconomic value is directly applicable to northern nut trees. This is\r\ntrue of the work with northwestern filberts, western walnuts, southern\r\npecans and even the tung industry. There comes a point, however, when\r\ninformation thus gained needs to be checked under the specific\r\nconditions where the crops are grown and very little research has been\r\ndone in the northern states where the hardy nuts are important.\r\n\r\nOf special importance to the northern nut growers is the control of\r\ndiseases and insects. At the present time the bunch disease of walnuts\r\nis becoming increasingly more troublesome and very little is known as to\r\nhow this is spread or how it may be controlled. In my own filbert\r\nplanting, the hazel bud mite during past years has made the crop\r\npractically a failure. Little apparently is known as to the life history\r\nof this insect or when miticides might be applied. Examples such as the\r\nbunch disease and mite damage are multiplied many times with other\r\ndiseases of local or regional importance. In my thinking our best hope\r\nfor getting something done is to encourage the Departments of Entomology\r\nand Plant Pathology in the experiment stations to take up these disease\r\nand insect problems, which might be attacked by graduate students as\r\nthesis subjects, even though the economic importance is not great.\r\n\r\nAs I see the situation of the Association, there is need for its members\r\nto produce more nuts of better quality. Nothing intrigues the interest\r\nof potential members as much as actually seeing and tasting locally\r\ngrown samples of nuts of superior varieties. On several occasions I have\r\ntried to assemble collections of nuts for exhibit or to buy them for one\r\npurpose or another and found great difficulty in finding sources of\r\nsupply. This was particularly true in the fall of 1951 when we were\r\ntrying to assemble nuts for \"The Things of Science\" project. We wanted\r\nvery much to secure Carpathian walnuts that could be sent out and used\r\nfor seed purposes. There was no source to which we could turn. In\r\nseveral possible sources of supply, husk maggots had so infested the\r\ncrop that the nuts were discolored and unattractive. It might have been\r\npossible to secure enough black walnuts to include in the kit but the\r\nproblem of state quarantines against the bunch disease could not be\r\neasily adjusted.\r\n\r\nFinally I believe the Northern Nut Growers Association is doing a very\r\nsignificant work. Our emphasis at the present time at least might very\r\nwell be on nut growing as a hobby and for conservation, for better shade\r\ntrees and for better living on the farms and homesteads rather than to\r\nemphasize the commercial angles. This will come in time if it can really\r\nbe demonstrated that growing northern nut trees is a profitable venture.\r\nIn these days of job specialization everyone needs a hobby and an outlet\r\nfor special interests. I know of few other fields of endeavor for those\r\nwho like growing things than the rewards that are to be found in the\r\ngrowing of hardy nut trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONDAY AFTERNOON SESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Monday afternoon session was convened at one o'clock p.m.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: The afternoon session will please be in order.\r\n\r\nThe first paper this afternoon will be, \"The Future of Your Nut\r\nPlanting,\" Mr. W. F. Sonnemann, Vandalia, Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Future of Your Nut Planting\r\n\r\nW. F. SONNEMANN, _Vandalia, Ill._\r\n\r\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to appear before the\r\nNorthern Nut Growers Association. I am just a sprout as far as nut\r\ngrowing is concerned, when we consider the age of some of our old\r\nhickory nut trees.\r\n\r\nAbout 25 years ago, I became interested in nut growing and, in\r\nparticular, the river-bottom hickory nut tree. Then we had so many nut\r\ntrees growing in the bottom that we never thought of trying to plant a\r\ntree or look after one. People could gather all the nuts they wanted and\r\noften the trees were cut just to get the nuts. They'd lay a stick of\r\ndynamite at the base of the tree to shake the nuts off.\r\n\r\nAfter a few years of that, I thought we might do something to save the\r\nnut trees for the future generations. That's when I first started to\r\nplant some nuts. Incidentally, I made a big mistake, by not joining the\r\nNorthern Nut Growers Association.\r\n\r\nNaturally, I wanted the largest pecan I could find. I went to the St.\r\nLouis market and bought and planted nice Papershell pecans--very nice\r\npecans, but the trees do not mature their crop. Mr. McDaniel and I tried\r\nto top-work them, but that's a big job. Had I joined the Northern Nut\r\nGrowers Association, I could have avoided a lot of those mistakes.\r\n\r\nThere are some things that I found out in practicing law that can very\r\nwell apply to nut growing. If you will pardon the reference to personal\r\nexperience, I can bring forth to you about four situations. One, a good,\r\nclose friend of mine had a vacant lot close to his home. He had been\r\nplanting nut trees and papaw trees and persimmon trees for years. On\r\nthis vacant lot he had a 25-year-old Busch walnut growing back on the\r\nalley, on the lawn was a beautiful Japanese flowering cherry, and there\r\nwere two pecan trees in the yard proper. He sold the lot to a neighbor\r\nwhose wife was just crazy about flowers, little dreaming that those\r\ntrees would ever be cut down. I don't believe the ink of the recorder\r\nhad been cooled or dried before that English walnut was cut down, the\r\nJapanese cherry grubbed out of the front lawn, and one of the pecan\r\ntrees was cut. It just about broke the old owner's heart, and all he\r\ncould say was, \"I am just disappointed in my neighbors.\" And now there\r\nis a house being erected there, and the pecan tree that was 12 inches in\r\ndiameter was cut. That could have been prevented, had this man given\r\nthought to the future.\r\n\r\nAnother man, named Hagen, who was instrumental in getting me interested\r\nin nut growing, had a nice group of river-bottom shellbark trees growing\r\nin his field. One of these has been propagated and named the Hagen, and\r\nalthough it isn't a good cracking quality, it's a very large nut.\r\n\r\nA pipe line was laid close to that field, and this man had the\r\nfore-*sight to put a clause in this pipe-line right of way which gave\r\nhim the protection of collecting adequate damages for the destruction\r\nof the trees. Didn't even need a lawyer, which is something bad for the\r\nlaw business. It is a suggestion, that when a pipe line, or telephone\r\ncompany is buying a right of way, it is possible to protect your\r\ninterests in valuable trees.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of protecting nut trees was when the new U. S. Highway\r\n40 was built across Illinois. I had the job of condemning the right of\r\nway and when the engineer and I were out walking over it we noticed a\r\nfine group of hickory nut trees on the hillside. I remarked what a nice\r\ngroup of trees it was. He said, \"Yes, that's going to be a borrow pit up\r\nthere.\" I said, \"You mean they are going to destroy those trees?\" He\r\nsaid, \"Yes, dirt from this borrow pit will make the fill across this\r\nbottom.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Why can't we get the dirt somewhere else? Dirt is dirt.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the engineer said, \"Well, that's the plans.\" We had a little\r\ncontrariness there, and I had to threaten to drop the case as far as\r\nthat tract of land was concerned. If you fight long enough and hard\r\nenough in such cases you may find some other person who is interested in\r\nnut trees. We did; we found an engineer higher up, and that group of\r\nhickory trees is now a picnic area. They used a borrow pit somewhere\r\nelse, and it gives me a great pleasure to drive past that group of\r\nhickory trees and see them still standing there. In the fall of the year\r\nyou'd be surprised at the number of people at that picnic area, and they\r\nkeep those hickory nuts picked up clean as fast as they fall.\r\n\r\nIn our county hospital just started they happened to select a piece of\r\nground I own an interest in for a county hospital. On that are some good\r\nhickory nut trees. I told them they'd never get the land until they made\r\nsome arrangements in regard to those nut trees. The engineer that\r\ndesigned that hospital must have had some sense, because they are\r\nbuilding a canopy around one of the trees adjacent to that hospital, and\r\nhave arranged to cut only one scrub oak. The other trees will be\r\nmentioned in the deed with restrictive covenants to protect them.\r\n\r\nIf you sign anything a company gives you, you are liable to have\r\nanything cut on your land. Remember the saying that \"the big print gives\r\nit to you and the fine print takes it away.\" And it's the fine print you\r\nwant to watch in all your right of ways or in your condemnation\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nI know a man who had almost 160 acres of river-bottom hickories. During\r\nhis lifetime he was very careful about those trees. He would cut the\r\nbrush around the trees and harvest those hickory nuts as if it was a\r\ncrop of corn or beans. Upon his death his children were scattered over\r\nthe various states. They didn't care anything for this hickory grove.\r\nIt's been cut. Now there is a bulldozer in there trying to clean out\r\nthose hickory stumps. They are not making much progress. All you now\r\nhave in that farm is 160 acres of old tree stumps, wild honey-suckle\r\nvines, poison ivy and poison oak, and even a coon hunter gripes when he\r\nhas to take his dogs through there on a coon hunt. Those heirs care\r\nnothing about it.\r\n\r\nIn selling land it doesn't make any difference whether it's a sale to a\r\nneighbor, or to a friend or a stranger, you should protect any trees\r\nthat you have growing upon that land by what we term a covenant running\r\nwith the land, and that means if a deed is made it will provide that\r\ncertain trees shall not be cut within a certain period of time. In one\r\ncase where I am forced to sell some land I am protecting the trees for\r\n10 years.\r\n\r\nEach of these situations requires research under your own state laws. I\r\nhad hoped to be able to tell you something definite and precise as to\r\neach situation, but when I considered the membership in the Northern Nut\r\nGrowers, the many states it covers and the great difference in the state\r\nlaws, it's just impossible to lay your hand upon one set of facts that\r\ngoverns. You should consult your attorney who is dealing with your\r\ntransactions and tell him specifically what you have in mind and what\r\nyou want to protect. He will know whether your state recognizes\r\ncovenants running with your land and what provision can be made to\r\nprotect trees that you want to save or secure damages.\r\n\r\nRemember, in any transaction, if it is not in the written instrument\r\nthat you sign, it's just an oral agreement that you make on the side,\r\nand it doesn't mean a thing. It has to be in the paper that you sign.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned briefly, in what they call \"eminent domain\", the state\r\nhas a right to take property for public use. The only thing you can do\r\nthere is just get your head square and fight, and if you are stubborn\r\nenough, you may find someone in the organization that you are dealing\r\nwith who has some interest in trees. They may not be members of the\r\nNorthern Nut Growers Association or any tree association, but there are\r\nsome people who appreciate trees and who do realize how long it takes to\r\nhave a nice pecan tree or nice hickory nut tree growing.\r\n\r\nIf they call you contrary, that you won't give in to anything, let them\r\ncall you contrary, let them call you nuts, but you can protect your\r\ntrees and make sure that their future is secure.\r\n\r\nWhat will happen to your trees after you are dead? Each individual's\r\nsituation has to be considered separately. In many states you can\r\nprovide by will to whom you want your nut planting to go, or you can, by\r\nmaking a trust, give the trees to trustees with certain powers and\r\nduties to care for and manage them for a period of time or perpetually,\r\ndepending on the laws of your state. Usually it is limited to the life\r\nof some person or 21 years. In that length of time if your heirs or the\r\nperson you desire these trees to go to have not educated themselves to\r\nthe value of the tree, then the planting will be lost anyway.\r\n\r\nIn all of these cases and all the transactions that you make, if you\r\nvalue your trees--and you surely do when you will carry water for them\r\nand plant them and dig that large hole for those roots--it is worth\r\nwhile to look after them during the trees' lifetime, not your own\r\nlifetime. And if you will consult with your attorney, particularly\r\nmention those trees to him and just exactly what your ideas are, I think\r\nyou will be assured that you will have a future for nut trees.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: Thank you, Mr. Sonnemann.\r\n\r\nAre there any questions you wish to ask on this subject. Here is a\r\nchance to get free legal advice on the spot. That's unusual.\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVATT: There is one point I'd like to bring out, backing up what\r\nthe gentleman just said. You know we introduced back in 1928 to 1936\r\nvery large numbers of Chinese and Japanese chestnuts. Most of them went\r\nout to state forestry departments and such; somewhere around a half\r\nmillion trees. We have had some very valuable cooperative orchard\r\nplantings, which have been lost because something happened to the man,\r\nhe moved away, sold his property, or died. With these gentlemen who have\r\npassed away, experimental orchard plantings and other trees were part of\r\ntheir lives, but their children, or whoever inherited the property, had\r\nno interest in continuing the work.\r\n\r\nWe have had the same experience with some agricultural experiment\r\nstations where one of the horticulturists is interested in the\r\nplantings, but has moved away, and we have lost our plantings.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: Thank you, Dr. Gravatt. Mr. Becker, do you wish to\r\nsay something about the Reed Memorial?\r\n\r\nMR. BECKER: This is just a word of appreciation to a number of the\r\nNorthern Nut Growers members who have helped out with the C. A. Reed\r\nMemorial.\r\n\r\nWhen we organized the Michigan Nut Growers Association last January it\r\nwas Professor O'Rourke's idea to have a memorial at Mr. Reed's home\r\ntown, which is Howell, Michigan. With Mrs. Reed's approval we planned as\r\nour first project, planting a nut tree with a suitable plaque in memory\r\nof the late Dr. Reed.\r\n\r\nAs a followup, we issued a little bulletin asking for contributions\r\ntoward the memorial. We sent these out to people who knew Mr. Reed, many\r\nof whom are among this group.\r\n\r\nResponse has been gratifying and we now have approximately $95 toward\r\nthe tablet. On Arbor Day a Michigan variety of shagbark hickory called\r\nthe Abscoda was planted at Howell on the library grounds. The services\r\nwere conducted with the cooperation of the Michigan State College and\r\nthe Livingston County garden group. This is a word of appreciation and\r\nalso to explain what we have done. Thank you. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: We will go on to the next paper, \"The Value of a\r\nTree,\" Ferdinand Bolten, Linton, Indiana. Mr. Bolton. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMR. BOLTEN: Members of the Northern Nut Growers Association and ladies\r\nand gentlemen: I am just a farmer. I am not a speech-maker, like the\r\nlawyer here who makes his living talking. I make my living farming, and\r\nI have some ideas, views that I'd like to bring before you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Value of a Tree\r\n\r\nFERD BOLTEN, _Linton, Ind._\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers of the Northern Nut Growers Association, ladies, and gentlemen.\r\nIt may be a little unusual for a fruit grower and farmer to be on this\r\nprogram; however, I have lived a lifetime working with trees on the same\r\nfarm I was born on sixty-six years ago last May. We have one hundred\r\nacres of orchard, several varieties of nut trees, including English\r\nwalnut, pecans, hybrid pecans or hicans, hickories, filberts, hazelnuts,\r\nheart nuts, butternuts, black walnuts; also, persimmons, pawpaws,\r\nhybrid oaks and many of the native forest trees. In operating a farm\r\nthis size, you naturally get a lot of experience and headaches. A very\r\ngood friend of mine told me a joke that I think fits in with my farm\r\nvery well. He said a fruit grower delivered a load of apples to the\r\ninsane asylum. One of the inmates was helping unload the apples. The\r\ninmate kept talking about apples, so the grower asked him if he was ever\r\non a fruit farm. The inmate replied that he was before he came to the\r\nasylum and, in return, asked the grower if he had ever been in the\r\nasylum. The grower replied that he had not. Then the inmate said, \"Mr.,\r\nI have been both places, and I can tell you something. It is a lot nicer\r\nhere than it is on a fruit farm\".\r\n\r\nMy subject is,\r\n\r\nTHE VALUE OF A TREE\r\n\r\nA tree out of its natural habitat sometimes becomes worthless. As an\r\nextreme example, the orange tree in Indiana has no commercial value and\r\nthe apple tree in Florida has no commercial value. Therefore, it seems\r\nthat we should, in Indiana, endeavor to develop better trees in the\r\ntrees which are at home here. This includes the native hickory and the\r\nblack walnut, hazels, filberts and the pecans in Southern Indiana.\r\nPersonally, I am spending quite a bit of time with the Crath Carpathian\r\nEnglish or Persian Walnut. Last winter, I lost seven out of fifty trees\r\nfrom some cause, after they had gone through the winter of 1950 and\r\n1951, at a temperature of nineteen below zero without injury. It may\r\nhave been they were caught last fall by a hard freeze in full foliage,\r\nearly before the apples were all picked; and, again, it may be blight. I\r\nhope not. But this I do know, the hickory and black walnut in their\r\nnatural habitat were not injured.\r\n\r\nI wonder why hickories are so erratic in their bearing habits. Could it\r\nbe the winter rest period? For example, the peach has to have from seven\r\nhundred hours, in some varieties, to twelve hundred hours, in others, of\r\nbelow forty-five degrees temperature, or they will not set a good crop\r\nof fruit. The value of a variety of peach in Georgia sometimes is\r\ndetermined by the number of hours of rest period below forty-five\r\ndegrees that the variety has to have. It has happened that the same\r\nvariety of peach has produced a good crop in Northern Georgia and a poor\r\ncrop in Southern Georgia. Where the winter was not as cold in Indiana we\r\nnever lose crops from the lack of enough cold weather; we lose them from\r\nsub-zero temperatures. So you see, the value of a variety in Georgia is\r\ndifferent to Indiana.\r\n\r\nThe value of a tree may be in the wood or in the food its produces, or\r\nits beauty in winter. Many a picture is taken of evergreens covered with\r\nsnow. Its value may be its beauty in summer, or the coloring of its\r\nleaves in the fall. There is also a sentimental value; a limb that is\r\njust right for a child's swing, the Constitutional Elm at Corydon, or\r\nthe Harrison Oak at North Bend, Ohio. They have a historical value and\r\nare visited by many people.\r\n\r\nA man said to me some time ago, \"I wonder why God made the hicans the\r\ncross between the pecans and the hickory?\" There may be a valuable nut\r\ntree show up in the second or third generation of the hybrid trees when\r\ncertain characteristics begin to revert to the parent trees. I have on\r\nmy farm some hybrid oaks grafted, and am very anxious to see them\r\nproduce acorns so I can plant them and watch the results. This hybrid\r\noriginated in the Greene and Sullivan County Forest in Indiana, and is\r\ncalled the Carpenter Oak after Mr. Carpenter, the district forester. It\r\nis, apparently, a cross between the shingle oak and the pin oak because\r\nit is comparable with both of them.\r\n\r\nThe value of a tree is not always the one that wins first prize in the\r\nshow. The best plate of nuts in the show may not be from the most\r\nvaluable tree, because it may be biennial in bearing habits, it may be a\r\nshy bearer, it may be an early bloomer and subject to frost. My most\r\nproductive Crath Carpathian tree is not the best walnut and would not\r\nget anywhere in the show, but it is hardy, blooms late, and is\r\nproductive; so its value is in these traits. The number of chromosomes\r\nin the Crath Carpathian walnut may be different. There is quite a\r\ndifference in the size of nuts produced on individual trees. This\r\nindicates that there may be a difference in chromosome count. If this is\r\ntrue, it will be a great help in improving the size of the nuts\r\nproduced. It may be of value in pollination. The triploid apple needs to\r\nbe pollinated by the diploid variety. By setting them close together,\r\nyou get a much better set of fruit.\r\n\r\nSometimes I think trees are as temperamental as people. Some trees,\r\nespecially the apple, lose their value because they are subject to\r\ncertain diseases. Some are susceptible to scab, blight, codling moth,\r\nrots, blotch, and other diseases, to a point where they become worthless\r\nas commercial varieties. The honey locust has been considered one of the\r\ntrees on farms to be destroyed, because it was thought to be worthless.\r\nNow, its value is being found in the correcting of sugar deficiency in\r\ndairy cattle. The pods of the honey locust are one of the best foods to\r\ncorrect sugar deficiency and cattle like them and eat them freely. I\r\nhave on my farm a thornless honey locust that produced ten bushels of\r\npods one year. The honey locust is also a legume and produces nitrogen\r\nwhich, in turn, is used by the pasture grasses and makes more pasture\r\nfor the cattle.\r\n\r\nThe mulberry tree that ripens when cherries are ripe has a value in the\r\nfact that every mulberry eaten by a bird saves a cherry and the birds\r\nare valuable because they destroy insects that cause the worms in\r\ncherries.\r\n\r\nAfter observing trees for years, I am convinced that there are certain\r\nstrains or families of trees in the forest that have outstanding traits.\r\nThose traits in growth might be dwarfs or they may be giants; they may\r\nhave short lives or long lives, like different varieties of apples. The\r\nfruit or seeds may be large or small. I believe as reforestation\r\nprogresses there will be certain trees located which have value as seed\r\ntrees and which will improve the forest equal to the improvement in\r\nlivestock on the farms today. The razor back hog that roamed the forest\r\nis gone and has been replaced by animals much improved; yet, the forest\r\nin which it roamed is the same. Now we are turning to man made forests\r\nand a chance to improve them by selecting the more valuable trees for\r\nour source of seed. In the native hickory and black walnut, there is a\r\ngreat need for more interest in searching for and preserving the most\r\nvaluable trees for their cracking quality, flavor, and productivity.\r\nThere have been and are now, nut trees on farms that were valuable\r\ntrees, but were known only to the owner and the small boys of the\r\ncommunity. These trees should have been preserved for posterity, but\r\nmany of them are lost forever.\r\n\r\nIn forestry, a tree's value may be in its ability to re-seed itself. In\r\nthe kinds of pine, the Virginia pine is one of the best, and also, one\r\nof the youngest to produce seed cones. I have counted twenty-five cones\r\non a five year old Virginia Pine tree. In forestry, the red cedar is\r\ngood to re-seed itself in the area in which it grows. The maple ash,\r\ncotton wood, and poplar also grow freely from nature's seeding.\r\n\r\nEvery tree that grows has a value. The leaves help purify the air; the\r\npersimmon and the tree with a wild grapevine are food for wild life. The\r\nold hollow tree is a refuge for the coon and o'possum and other wild\r\nlife. I have a hollow white oak on my farm I let stand because a family\r\nof squirrels is raised in it every year. I also have a bee tree and the\r\nbees help pollinate my fruit trees so they produce better. A world\r\nwithout trees would be a desolate place. The value of a park is in its\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the value of trees for the preservation of wild life,\r\nbut how do trees affect the life of man and how does man affect tree\r\nlife? Man is the builder or destroyer of tree life; although the tree is\r\nthe oldest living thing in plant or animal life, man is master over\r\ntrees. A man came into my farm office one day and said, \"Everything in\r\nthis room either grew from the earth or was mined from the earth.\" How\r\nabout everything in this room? The furniture, the clothing you wear, the\r\nring on your finger, the glass in the windows, etc.? Let us think for a\r\nminute, what are the things of the greatest value in this room? We have\r\nan organization, The Northern Nut Growers Association. It did not grow\r\nfrom the earth, there is knowledge of science here, there are doctors'\r\ndegrees (I wish I had one), there is ambition, honesty, love, pride, and\r\npatriotism. Man's knowledge is the key. What he leaves alone or what he\r\ndestroys. So the greatest value is man's knowledge. After all, the\r\ngreatest values are the things that come from the minds and the hearts\r\nof men. By man's efforts, we find or develop these valuable trees.\r\n\r\nThe value of a home is increased by trees. The love of trees and the\r\npride in owning a home is hard to separate. The privilege in America to\r\nown a home and plant a tree on your own ground is of great value. It has\r\nbeen said that he, who plants a tree, is truly a servant of God. I\r\nsometimes wonder if this great value of the privilege of owning a piece\r\nof ground and building a home and planting a tree is in danger of being\r\nlost under the present creeping grip of socialism and communism. This\r\nprivilege of planting and owning a tree is of greater value than any\r\ntree, and we must not lose this valuable inheritance in America.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: Mr. Magill, are you all set with your program?\r\n\r\nMR. MAGILL: Yes, sir. This is to be a discussion of \"Methods of Getting\r\nBetter Annual Crops on Black Walnut--A symposium led by W. W. Magill\r\n(Kentucky)--Discussion by a panel made up of W. G. Tatum, Spencer Chase,\r\nW. B. Ward and Mr. Schlagenbusch.\" Will those men come here? We will get\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nMy business in life is Extension peddler down in Kentucky, working on\r\nfruits and nuts and berries, and naturally that takes me into a good\r\nmany counties. We have 120, and I have been in all of them. Some places\r\ndidn't have anything, so no reason to go back. But I pick up a lot of\r\nconversation, people give you ideas and things to think about.\r\n\r\nWe were talking about the conditions of the world--everybody's got a\r\ngood job and plenty of money and biggest incomes that the country has\r\never known. That's true, but if you take down in the hills and hollows\r\ninto some places that I go and you take the financial status of certain\r\nof those families, it's not measured in thousands of dollars, some cases\r\nnot hardly measured in hundreds of dollars. It's measured in terms of\r\ngratuities and things to eat and not measured by greenbacks, and the\r\nfamilies don't pay income tax.\r\n\r\nLast fall I was out on a farm in the foothills some 70 miles from\r\nLexington, in a place that most of you folks wouldn't want to live in\r\nand call home, a little farm, probably 16 acres, with a widow lady\r\nprobably 65 years old, living there with her daughter. And among other\r\nthings, she said, \"Mr. Magill, I understand that you are supposed to\r\nknow something about nuts. See that tree standing right out there?\" She\r\nsays, \"I will give you a $20 bill if you will tell me how to make that\r\nnut tree bear annual crops.\"\r\n\r\nWell, I was a little bit surprised. I listened, and I got to asking her\r\nquestions. Some member of the family had gone to Chicago years ago, and\r\nshe knew about all the black walnut packing firms in Kentucky. This\r\nrelative had worked in the market, and had indicated she could get a\r\ndollar a pound for all the nut meats she would pick out and send to this\r\nrelative in Chicago. And that nut tree meant about 30 to 35 dollars a\r\nyear when it had a crop but only bore every other year.\r\n\r\nWell, that drove home just a little more to me than ever before the\r\nquestion of why certain nut trees bore and others didn't bear. To that\r\nlady there it meant $30 the year it bore and no income from that tree on\r\nthe year it didn't bear. And she stood there beside the home and pointed\r\nout other trees that bore regularly. And she said, \"Why do they bear\r\nregular crops and this good tree that makes so many fine, big kernels\r\nbears every other year?\" That's a challenge I am throwing out to this\r\naudience today to all the members on this panel.\r\n\r\nI am hoping that Pappy Ward or Friend Chase will answer that question\r\ncompletely. The thing I have in mind, is that in a group like we have\r\nhere today, as many nuts as we have got here, if we think about this\r\nquestion and talk to the folks back home, I believe in a year or two we\r\ncan have worked out and have printed in the records of the report some\r\npretty reasonable answers as to why nut trees don't bear, or why they\r\nbear heavy crops on certain years and are off certain years.\r\n\r\nMr. Ward, I know you have observed this over a period of years. What, in\r\nyour opinion, is the one factor that is more responsible for this\r\nalternate bearing of black walnuts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Black Walnuts Fail to Bear Satisfactory Crops\r\n\r\nW. B. WARD, _Department of Horticulture, Purdue University, Lafayette,\r\nInd._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen man or nature, and sometimes both, change the natural habits of a\r\ntree, most anything can happen. There are years when the black walnut\r\nsets very few fruits either on the seedling trees or trees of named\r\nvarieties. Some few trees have alternate years of production, while\r\nother trees bear annually and some not at all. Good results and good\r\ncrops may be expected only when several factors are normal and\r\nconditions favorable. After twenty years of keeping records and\r\nobservations on nut trees and through correspondence with other growers,\r\nI consider the main reason for crop failure or light production to be\r\nclimatic conditions and the weather for an entire year.\r\n\r\nThe black walnut produces a pistillate flower at the end of the present\r\nseason's growth. The staminate flowers, or catkins, come from last\r\nyear's wood. Good growing conditions are desirable for wood growth and\r\nfruit bud formation and any retarding of growth the previous season\r\nmeans little or no production. Winter injury to wood and bud, diseases\r\nor insects attacking the foliage, soil moisture, and summer temperatures\r\nwill lower tree vitality. There are times when strong vigorous trees\r\nfail to fruit which could be due to a high or low carbohydrate-nitrogen\r\nbalance. Soil type, plant food, age of tree, and location will have some\r\ninfluence on annual or even biennial production but yet are not the all\r\nimportant reasons for light crops.\r\n\r\nThe pollen of the black walnut is mostly wind borne as few insects ever\r\nvisit the flowers and pollination is dependent on wind borne pollen.\r\nTrees planted in groups and close together are generally more productive\r\nthan trees planted in orchard rows even as close as 40' by 40'. When the\r\nweather is cold and rainy during bloom, one should not expect much of a\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nThe staminate flowers opened early in Indiana the years of 1950, 1951,\r\nand 1952. The weather was more or less ideal during the time the catkins\r\nhad elongated and about ready to shed pollen. This warm spell was\r\nfollowed by a fairly cool weather and considerable rain, which delayed\r\nthe opening of the pistillate flowers, consequently the pollen dried and\r\nwas lost before the pistil was receptive.\r\n\r\nThe few walnut trees in the University plantation have always had the\r\nbest of care. The trees have been mulched, fertilized (both through root\r\nand leaf feedings), sprayed, cultivated and seeded to grass with the\r\ngrass clipped. The trees are some distance away from other seedling\r\nwalnuts and a bit off the beaten path of the right direction of the\r\nspring winds. The varieties are Ohio, Stambaugh, Stabler, Rohwer, and\r\nThomas. When the spring weather is balmy at flowering time, the trees\r\nbear a respectable crop but let the weather change to cool and moist and\r\nthen that is the time one begins to think about calling up the sawmill\r\nto see if there is any need for some good walnut logs.\r\n\r\nMR. MAGILL: That's a mighty good discussion. I see Mr. Ward has been\r\nobserving walnut trees closer than I assumed he had.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase, I know you have seen a lot of things in Tennessee that you\r\nare not going to tell us about, but I suggest that you discuss some of\r\nthe things you have observed about walnut trees bearing anywhere.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: Alternate bearing has been a problem with fruits and nuts\r\nsince time immemorial. I know a tremendous amount of work has been done\r\nwith the apple, which has a definite biennial bearing habit. There have\r\nbeen all sorts of things tried to make it bear annual crops, and as far\r\nas I know, there has not been anything effective developed along that\r\nline. Of course, there are varieties of apples that tend to bear annual\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Ward brought out--he took all my thunder, so I don't have much to\r\nsay--a tree may set a heavy crop of nuts one year because frost or poor\r\npollination the year before destroyed the crop so that a large amount of\r\ncarbohydrates were built up in the tree. Now, the tree in producing a\r\nheavy crop of well filled nuts utilizes every bit of carbohydrates it\r\nhas stored and can manufacture. While it is doing this the terminal bud\r\nis being formed for next year's crop, and if there isn't a sufficient\r\namount of carbohydrates in the tree at that critical period, there is\r\nnot likely to be a flower bud formed.\r\n\r\nThis is not limited just to walnuts, but occurs with nearly all fruits\r\nand nuts, with the possible exception of the chestnut.\r\n\r\nWe made a study which was reported in the 1946 report by Mr. Zarger in\r\nwhich he reported the bearing habits of some 135 trees over a 10-year\r\nperiod, and there were definite bearing cycles, or bearing habits. It\r\nwas not always an on year followed by an off year, but possibly two\r\nyears in a row, then nothing. There were some trees that went three\r\nyears without a crop, then a crop. Very few, however, had annual crops,\r\nand the annual crops were heavy or moderately heavy, followed by what we\r\nconsider a light crop.\r\n\r\nThese trees were scattered through seven states and, of course,\r\nconditions were not the same. They were all seedling trees, but careful\r\nrecords were kept on the bearing habits. There was a group of trees that\r\ncould not be classified into any definite bearing habit. In those\r\ninstances we suspected unfavorable weather at pollination time, but as a\r\ngeneral rule, in our section I don't believe we are concerned with that\r\nfactor.\r\n\r\nThe Thomas, which we can watch carefully in a nearby orchard, is\r\ndefinitely on one year and off the next. Quite a few are on one year and\r\noff two years. We haven't found any way to make that an annual crop,\r\nbecause when it sets a crop, it sets a bumper crop, and there is simply\r\nnot enough food in the tree to set a sufficient number of fruit buds for\r\nthe following year's crop. I am sure that a lot of you folks have\r\nobserved this, and I think, Mr. Magill, that you might sound out some of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMR. MAGILL: Going back to an observation I made as a kid, money didn't\r\ngrow in bushes around our place, and back in those days you could go out\r\nand kill ten rabbits and sell them for 8 cents apiece, and if you only\r\nused 4 cents apiece for ammunition, you have made 40 cents off of the\r\ndeal and had $20 worth of fun, and that was a good day's work. You\r\nremember those days, Pappy? Back in those same times, I used to get\r\nmoney out of hauling black walnuts to an old corn sheller and having\r\npeople who didn't have an interest in the corn sheller sell them for 50\r\ncents a bushel. That was also pin money. Come in mighty useful.\r\n\r\nWe had a certain group of trees on the farm I was raised on that bore\r\nevery other year, and I can think of two fields where we rearranged the\r\nfences in such a way as to make pasture fields out of them, and two of\r\nthose trees were where 15 or 20 cattle pastured. These were the only\r\nshade trees, and naturally they manured those trees. And I recall for a\r\nfew years I was getting annual crops from them. Apparently they got\r\nsomething supplied by cattle that they didn't have otherwise. Others in\r\nthe foothills of Kentucky, have come to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nI know a man who has pecan holdings in Alabama. He told me up to the\r\ntime he got the farm the trees had a few blooms but wouldn't set pecans.\r\nHe applied 15 mineral elements and claims to have got results from it. I\r\nhave talked to at least three people in my travelling around who tried\r\nthe same treatment on pecans, one in Georgia, one in Alabama and one in\r\nMississippi. They reported that they had improved yield on pecans by\r\nusing complete mineral fertilizer. That's in addition to nitrogen,\r\nphosphorus and potassium.\r\n\r\nI am foolish enough to think that that nice, young orchard of Mrs.\r\nWeber's would make an excellent place to try it. I understand that the\r\ntrees are not behaving as well as they should. I'd like for Ford\r\nWilkinson to be made chairman of a committee to see that they are\r\nfertilized according to some kind of a schedule that could be worked out\r\nand do some observing. That is one of the few places I know of in the\r\nseveral states that would be as adequately laid out. I'd like to see a\r\ncomplete fertilizer including nine or ten mineral elements used.\r\n\r\nI don't mean spend a lot of money, but you can do a lot of observing for\r\nrelatively few dollars. I just throw that out as a hint.\r\n\r\nI would like to open up this discussion. Mr. Bolten talked a while ago\r\nabout things he was growing out of the ground, or out of minerals.\r\nEverything comes from the ground, and I reckon you'd say this Northern\r\nNut Growers Association is a little like Topsy, it just developed, as\r\nthe fellow about the weeds. He said they weren't created, they just come\r\nall at once. Now I believe that out of this Northern Nut Growers\r\nassembly here that we have got some keen observers that might have\r\nsomething on their minds they want to tell us about. Who wants to speak\r\nfirst?\r\n\r\nMR. CALDWELL: This is just an observation I am throwing out for the\r\nbenefit of those who are here. I spent some time in China, and I was\r\ninterested in the fact that their walnuts there produced yearly crops.\r\nIn trying to find out why they produced yearly crops, I also discovered\r\nthat their persimmons, their plums and their peaches did the same thing.\r\nThe reason for that apparently goes back to their mythology. They\r\nbelieve in signs and doing certain things according to certain seasons\r\nof the year, and one of the things that they did was to gather together\r\nin the dark of the moon on one particular night at a certain time and\r\nbeat the living daylights out of these trees with big bamboo clubs. I\r\nwouldn't suggest that people here do that, but it's been known to\r\nforesters quite a while that by transplanting or severely pruning or\r\ngirdling trees that you could produce fruits on these trees the\r\nfollowing year. Apparently the Chinese so injured the cambium during the\r\nsevere beating that they have caused that wound stimulus to induce the\r\nformation of flower buds for the following year. By so doing in their\r\nEnglish or Persian walnuts they did have yearly crops. I have seen this\r\nmyself, and I checked back to see why. Perhaps they could explain it.\r\nThe only explanation we made was not fertilizing, but in the wounding of\r\nthe cambium. Now, perhaps there could be something done of that nature\r\nfor walnuts, but I wouldn't suggest getting around and beating the trees\r\nup.\r\n\r\nMR. MAGILL: In that connection, one man in Kentucky got the same answer.\r\nHe said about five years ago a cyclone came through there and blew the\r\nchimney off the house and uprooted a number of apple trees and leaned\r\nover three walnut trees, and he said they have borne five crops in\r\nsuccession. Now, this is the same story that you have got there.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: I'd just like to remark that I think that's a sort of\r\nnegative approach. I noticed a boy who had an apple tree that was about\r\nto die. He girdled it and got a tremendous crop of blossom. You probably\r\nhave secured the same results. That is one of Nature's ways to\r\nperpetuate itself. But I think there a constructive angle in those trees\r\nthat respond to nitrogenous fertilizer or manure. I believe the secret,\r\nif there is a secret, is that a tree in bearing a crop exhausts itself\r\nmore or less. It recuperates the following year and then is ready to\r\nbear another crop. And the way to meet that situation is to fertilize\r\nheavily, especially with nitrogen, the season of the heavy crop so that\r\nyou will have not only enough leaf growth to produce that crop, but to\r\nbuild up nutrients the following year. I believe that will help break\r\nthe cycle and establish more regularity.\r\n\r\nSome trees do that themselves; that is, they will bear a moderate crop\r\nevery year. I have the Land walnut at home. It bears every year. Certain\r\nchestnuts will bear every year, not excessive crops, but Hobson bears a\r\npretty good crop every year. I believe the secret of breaking that\r\non-and-off cycle is to fertilize heavily the year of production not the\r\nyear of non-production. If you apply nitrogen on the off year you\r\nproduce perhaps an excess of wood growth that year and overbearing the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nMR. MAGILL: Referring to apples, any of you apple growers well know that\r\nthe Golden Delicious and York Imperial grow crops in alternate years.\r\nNow, you come along with hormone sprays and take half or two-thirds of\r\nthe young fruits off soon after the trees blossom and throw them into\r\nregular production. That's the same thing that you are talking about,\r\nMr. Stoke. I never heard of anybody thinning walnuts. I don't know\r\nwhether they do or not. A lot of things I don't know, but I don't know\r\nof anybody ever thinning walnuts, except squirrels.\r\n\r\nMR. WARD: Last year a lady from Kokomo, Indiana, wrote me that she had a\r\nvery fine walnut tree growing near Mr. Bolten's place in Greene County,\r\nand as far as she could remember that tree had borne an annual crop for\r\nthe past 70 years. I wrote to Mr. Bolten asking him to investigate. If\r\nI remember correctly, these trees were grown in the poorest possible\r\nplace. Is that right, Mr. Bolten?\r\n\r\nMR. BOLTEN: Yes.\r\n\r\nMR. WARD: There were two or three trees right close together that had a\r\nnice crop and the ground was covered with a lot of nice nuts which Mr.\r\nBolten thought worth propagating, and he has a tree already started.\r\n\r\nWe have other varieties that we call the Saul, the Goose Creek and the\r\nAlley, which are all seedlings and which have produced almost every year\r\nwith about the same size of crop.\r\n\r\nIn our own planting, at the University, we have tried a lot of things\r\nwithout telling anybody about it. Every once in a while the boys mow the\r\norchard, and have bruised and barked a lot of these trees with no effect\r\nwhatever on bearing. We have time and time again taken the Stambaugh,\r\nOhio, Thomas, Stabler, and Aurora and have given them a good shot of\r\nfertilizer in the spring after a rain, and have produced wonderful\r\ngrowth in all of those years but still had only a light crop.\r\n\r\nA few years ago some of the boys were spraying the apple orchard with\r\nNu-Green and Urea at the rate of 5 pounds to 100 gallons of water, and\r\nhad a little extra. They said, \"Well, we don't like Ward's nut trees\r\nover there, we will put this stuff on them, and if it kills them, that's\r\nall right, and if they live, that's all right, too.\" They gave them some\r\nfeeding throughout the summer and we haven't found any different\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: May I say just one more thing to clarify my suggestion? I was\r\nassuming that potash and phosphate were present in sufficient quantity.\r\nWhat I wanted was leaf growth to store up energy and nutrients for the\r\nfollowing year and to apply that on the year of heavy crop, so besides\r\nmaturing the crop, it will provide that leaf growth, and not in the year\r\nof no crop.\r\n\r\nMR. WARD: We have tried that both ways, and going back, Mr. Stoke, again\r\nto the lack of pollination, it seems like both the pistillate and\r\nstaminate flowers are there, but they just don't set a crop of fruit.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: One thing more I wanted to say, and it slipped my mind. We\r\nknow any tree that grows too rapidly will not produce seed nor fruit,\r\nand excess nitrogen on apple or walnut or anything else will not cause\r\nthe formation of fruit buds, but the normal amount is necessary for the\r\nformation of buds.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: We have even got alternate bearing on persimmons in Urbana\r\nnow. Trees that bore extremely heavily didn't bloom this year.\r\n\r\nMR. MAGILL: We hill-billies have been taking a pass at that. I wonder if\r\nDr. Slate couldn't give us some scientific facts about this. How about\r\nit, Slate?\r\n\r\nDR. SLATE: Mr. Caldwell's remarks about the beating of the walnut trees\r\nin China reminds me of an ancient saying that, \"A dog, a woman, a walnut\r\ntree, the more you beat them the better they be.\"\r\n\r\nMR. DAVIDSON: One of my seedlings began to bear seven years ago, and has\r\nborne steadily every year exceptionally large crops. It never failed\r\nuntil this year, and the only explanation that I can give is that just\r\nas the bloom was incepted we had continuous rains. There was no\r\npollination of that tree, whereas other trees that were receptive at\r\nother times are pretty well filled.\r\n\r\nOut of two or three thousand trees you will find some exceptional ones.\r\nI have some that bear fairly good crops but do not fill. Walnut trees\r\nare just as different from each other as are apple trees. There are some\r\nthings you can't do anything about at all, and weather is one of the\r\nthings. One shouldn't be too much mystified by an occasional failure,\r\nbecause it may be due to continuous rains during the period of\r\npollination and when they are receptive.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: This matter of alternate bearing is one that has\r\nplagued the pomologist for a great many years, and one in which we made\r\nlittle progress, with apples for example, until with hormone sprays the\r\ntrees could be thinned very early in the year. Any thinning done after\r\nthe fruit was the size of your thumb was too late. However, now that the\r\nfruit can be thinned when it is very young, real progress is being made\r\nin securing annual bearing on varieties that previously were a serious\r\nproblem in alternate bearing.\r\n\r\nThe failure to fruit is due to many different factors. Some of these are\r\nexternal such as frost and rain at pollen shedding. There is nothing you\r\ncan do about these. Other factors are internal and determine the\r\nformation of fruit buds. If the tree is carrying an exceptionally heavy\r\ncrop, the chances are it will not have enough of the material which\r\ndetermines the setting of buds to form buds for the following year. With\r\nthe apples we can do something about this by thinning the crop at the\r\ntime it blooms. With walnuts, I don't see how we are going to do it.\r\nFertilization is another approach.\r\n\r\nCertainly we should make conditions just as favorable as possible for\r\ngrowth and for the development of the buds and by all means control\r\ninsects and diseases. If you do not have a good leaf surface good crops\r\nwill not be set the next year. It's a complex problem, but I don't think\r\nit is insoluble.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: Mr. Chairman, in connection with this matter of annual\r\nbearing of black walnut trees we believe that in doing all sorts of\r\nthings you will not influence the yielding of most of our black walnut\r\nvarieties. The black walnut, _Juglans nigra_ is probably--some of us\r\nthink, at least--constituted genetically in such a way that the\r\nvarieties we have do not yield annual crops simply because they are not\r\nconstituted that way. I know some of you may disagree with me, but one\r\nof the greatest arguments for this idea is the fact that in some of our\r\nother nut species we do have varieties that are genetically heavy\r\nproducers. For instance, we have a selection of Chinese chestnuts right\r\nnow that will bear annual crops on the poorest soil under any conditions\r\nimaginable. You can graft scions of that tree on other stocks and plant\r\nthem anywhere you choose under differing conditions and it will have a\r\nheavy set of burs. It may not fill the nuts, it may not attain the size,\r\nbut genetically speaking, inherently it is a heavy bearer. Perhaps our\r\nblack walnut species are inherently not annual producers. This is hard\r\nto prove, I admit, because the breeding of the species takes so long\r\nthat we cannot actually demonstrate it.\r\n\r\nWe have felt also that the black walnut species as a whole does not have\r\nthe characteristics of thin shells and good cracking qualities that we\r\nwant. For this reason we have begun a program of crossing the black\r\nwalnut with the English or Persian walnut, in order to get the thin\r\nshell that we want from the other species. Perhaps the same thing is\r\ntrue in the question of yield and the species as a whole does not have\r\nthe characteristic of yielding heavy annual crops.\r\n\r\nMR. MAGILL: I think we can readily see that we haven't settled this\r\nproblem but it is time to close the discussion.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: The next paper that we have is by H. F. Stoke of\r\nRoanoke, Virginia, \"Survey on Hickory Varieties.\" Mr. Stoke is the\r\nchairman of our Survey Committee. Last year he brought us very valuable\r\ninformation about walnuts, and this year he is going to talk about the\r\nhickories. Mr. Stoke.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: They delegated the job to the Survey Committee to make a\r\nhickory survey for this year, using the different state and provincial\r\nand national vice-presidents to collect the data. I am going to read\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 1952 Hickory Survey\r\n\r\nBy the Survey Committee\r\n\r\nH. F. STOKE, _Chairman_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn compiling this report the pecan has been omitted from the list. As it\r\nis the most important member of the hickory group it was felt that the\r\nnational and state pecan associations are far more competent to compile\r\ncomplete and reliable data on the species than is this organization.\r\n\r\nThe response by our vice-presidents to the questionnaire sent out has\r\nbeen rather disappointing, replies having been received from slightly\r\nless than half their number. It is apparent that interest in the hickory\r\nis considerably less than in the black walnut, which was surveyed in\r\n1951.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most beloved and widely distributed of the hickories is the\r\nshagbark, _Carya ovata_. It is reported from Massachusetts on the east\r\nto southeastern Minnesota, southward to Texas and eastward to the\r\nCarolinas where it mingles with and is sometimes confused with the\r\nscalybark. In the opinion of many the superb distinctive flavor of its\r\nnuts is not equaled by those of any species.\r\n\r\nThe domain of the Shellbark or Kingnut _C. laciniosa_ lies within the\r\nsame area but is slightly less extensive. Like the pecan, it is partial\r\nto the rich alluvial bottom lands along streams and is seldom found\r\nelsewhere. It occurs rarely in Virginia and North Carolina, and there\r\nonly in the Appalachian area.\r\n\r\nThe Scalybark or southern Shagbark, _C. Carolina septentrionalis_, is\r\nreported only by Virginia, West Virginia and the Carolinas.\r\n\r\nThe White Hickory or Mockernut, _C. alba_, covers the South and is\r\nreported as far north as Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana and, rarely, in\r\nMichigan. It is found from the Atlantic coast to east Texas.\r\n\r\nThe widely distributed Bitternut, _C. cordiformis_, covers virtually the\r\nsame territory as the shagbark.\r\n\r\nThe Sweet Pignut, _C. glabra_, is reported from New Hampshire to\r\nWisconsin and southward to North Carolina. Its south-westward occurrence\r\nhas not been defined in reports received.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these better-known species, the Water Hickory, _C.\r\naquatica_, is reported from Louisiana, and the Black Hickory, _C.\r\nbuckleyi_, from Indiana and Texas.\r\n\r\nIn an unusually full report Indiana lists all of sixteen hickory species\r\nand sub-species as appearing in The Flora of Indiana, a book by Mr.\r\nCharles Deam, former State Forester. The list follows.\r\n\r\n   1.        _C. pecan_\r\n\r\n   2.        _C. cordiformis_\r\n\r\n   3.        _C. ovata_\r\n\r\n   3a.       _C. ovata_, var, _fraxinifolia_\r\n\r\n   3b.       _C. ovata_, var. _nuttali_\r\n\r\n   4.        _C. laciniosa_\r\n\r\n   5.        _C. tomentosa (alba)_\r\n\r\n   5a.       _C. tomentosa_ var. _subcoriacea_\r\n\r\n   6.        _C. glabra_\r\n\r\n   6a.       _C. glabra_ var. _megacarpa_\r\n\r\n   7.        _C. ovalis_\r\n\r\n   7a, b, c. _C. ovalis_ var. _odorata_\r\n\r\n   7d.       _C. ovalis_ var. _obovalis_\r\n\r\n   7e.       _C. ovalis_ var. _obcordata_\r\n\r\n   8.        _C. ovalis_ var. _pallida_\r\n\r\n   9.        _C. ovalis_ var. _buckleyi_\r\n\r\nDoubtless many sub-species and variants are actually hybrids of obscure\r\nancestry. Virginia has many such.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to doubt that the hickories will grow anywhere\r\necological conditions approximate those of their native habitat. This is\r\ntrue in the Pacific coast states. Mr. Julio Grandjean, of Hillerod,\r\nDenmark, reports that there are several white hickories, _C. alba_ or\r\n_C. tomentosa_, growing in the Horsholm Royal Park that were planted\r\nabout 1790. There is no reason to believe that such northern species as\r\nthe shellbark and shagbark would not also succeed. He reports\r\nwinter-killing of pecans from southern sources. Inasmuch as extreme\r\nwinter temperatures in Denmark are less than in some places where the\r\npecan is grown here, it would appear that the more northern strains\r\nshould succeed there, though lack of summer heat would prevent the\r\nmaturing of nuts.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be much less interest in planting hickories on home\r\ngrounds than the value of the species justifies. Only five states,\r\nIndiana, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, indicated any\r\nlocal interest. In each case the shagbark was the preferred species.\r\nApparently we must still depend on the much-abused squirrel for the\r\nfuture of the hickory.\r\n\r\nR. E. Hodgson of the Southeast Experiment Station, Waseca, Minn.,\r\nreports 15 named varieties of hickory under test, but no evaluation of\r\ntheir worth can be made as yet.\r\n\r\nDr. R. T. Dunstan of Greensboro, North Carolina, has also a considerable\r\nnumber of hickory varieties under more advanced test. Results have been\r\nhighly variable. He finds that Schinnerling has filled poorly; Whitney\r\nand Shaul are \"Excellent growers and highly satisfactory bearers.\"\r\nWhitney, however, with a kernel of superb quality, cracks poorly and the\r\nhusk is thick and heavy. Shaul is reported as having a rather thin\r\nkernel and cracking poorly, also.\r\n\r\nRomig, that has been late in coming into bearing, is described as\r\nproducing a large, handsome nut of good quality that cracks unusually\r\nwell. Grainger, good in other respects, has borne light crops as also\r\nhave Glover and Weschcke. Fox is described as superb in every respect\r\nexcept cracking quality.\r\n\r\nAmong the hicans, Burton is declared to be outstanding in vigor and\r\nhealth of tree, and production of good regular crops of delicious nuts\r\nthat crack well.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that in his extensive hickory experiments Dr.\r\nDunstan is using pecan stocks. He uses the bark-slot method of grafting\r\nand hot wax compounded of 10 parts resin, 2 parts beeswax and one part\r\nKieselguhr. Both method and wax he finds highly successful.\r\n\r\nDr. Dunstan also reports a Mahan pecan grafted on a white or mockernut\r\nhickory stock that produces heavy crops of well-filled nuts. This is an\r\nexceptional performance for this variety.\r\n\r\nMr. Fayette Etter, of Pennsylvania, supports Dr. Dunstan in the use of\r\npecan stocks for hickories. He states that the young trees grow more\r\nrapidly in the nursery, transplant better, and grow faster thereafter\r\nthan when on hickory stocks.\r\n\r\nMr. A. G. Hirschi, of Oklahoma reports that in the hilly \"blackjack\"\r\ncountry of southeastern Oklahoma the scrub has been cleared away and a\r\n40-acre project of grafting the native hickory (probably white or\r\nmockernut) with pecan has been established. The land has been terraced\r\nand is cropped with cotton. The results have been so satisfactory that\r\nthis plot in one year carried off more prizes on pecans than any other\r\nentry within the state.\r\n\r\nMr. Harald E. Hammar reports from Louisiana that there has been some\r\ngrafting of pecan on hickory, species not specified. The older trees\r\nshow a decided overgrowth of the hickory stock by the more vigorous\r\npecan, in some cases the diameter being almost double above the graft of\r\nthat below.\r\n\r\nIn virtually all cases of topworking hickory on pecan, or vice versa,\r\nthe bark slot graft has been used.\r\n\r\nIn point of preference of named varieties, Michigan suggests Abscoda,\r\nOhio suggests Stafford, while Pennsylvania recommends Glover, Goheen,\r\nWhitney and Weschcke, in that order.\r\n\r\nIn naming the insects and diseases that attack the hickories,\r\nPennsylvania offers the following rather appalling list:\r\n\r\n   Nut curculio\r\n   Hickory shuckworm\r\n   Galls\r\n   Spider mites\r\n   Twig girdlers\r\n   Fall web worm\r\n   Pecan phylloxera\r\n   Black pecan aphids\r\n   Flathead apple borer\r\n   Other unnamed borers\r\n\r\nThose that know Mr. Etter will understand that this formidable list is\r\ndue to his excellent powers of observation and his integrity rather than\r\nto the likelihood that the state of Pennsylvania is worse plagued with\r\ninsects than others. Dr. Dunstan lists leaf-spot along with some of\r\nthose listed above, but adds that none are generally serious. This is\r\ncorroborated by other reporters.\r\n\r\nWild nuts are generally harvested for home use. Commercial marketing,\r\nreported by Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia, Virginia and North\r\nCarolina, is in all cases local. Usually the nuts are marketed whole,\r\nbut occasionally home-picked kernels are sold.\r\n\r\nGood stands of second-growth shagbark hickory are reported in\r\nPennsylvania. Kansas reports limited shellbark and bitternut stands.\r\nWest Virginia reports considerable stands of young shagbark and pignut,\r\nwhile North Carolina reports small stands of mockernut.\r\n\r\nThe industrial use of hickory reached its height in the horse and buggy\r\ndays. Nothing equalled its strong, tough wood for the wheels and running\r\ngears of horse-drawn vehicles. Old-timers will recall \"hoop poles\", tall\r\nslender young saplings of shagbark hickory that were split and fashioned\r\nwith the \"drawshave\" into barrel hoops.\r\n\r\nThe market for hickory still remains, however. It is universally used\r\nfor hand tool handles, if obtainable. In the mountains of the South\r\nhickory \"splints\" are still woven into imperishable baskets and chair\r\nseats. Louisiana insists it is still the only fuel for roasting barbecue\r\nand there is, indeed, no finer wood fuel of any species.\r\n\r\nThose propagating hickory trees for sale and distribution should be\r\ngiven every encouragement. They are contributing a real patriotic\r\nservice. No tree is more characteristically American. Except for a\r\nrelated species in China, it is found nowhere else in the world. In\r\nbeauty, utility and durability no tree has greater appeal. Who plants a\r\nhickory plants for generations unborn.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: If there are any misstatements, I'd be glad to have them\r\npublicly corrected.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: Thank you, Mr. Stoke. The comment that you made\r\nthat there wasn't as much enthusiasm about the hickory as about the\r\nblack walnut, although true, is not the way I personally feel about it.\r\nI have at Ithaca a number of trees of various kinds of nuts, and I think\r\nthat the enjoyment I get out of the hickories, which we grow, is as\r\ngreat or greater than that from the black walnuts. The Davis hickory is\r\none of the best that matures, the Wilcox--that's an Ohio nut--probably\r\nhas a bushel and a half of nuts in the shuck this year, and the Kentucky\r\nwill give a pretty good record. Of about 20 varieties, those are the\r\nonly ones which amount to anything, and we have a fairly good selection.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal said about stocks in Mr. Stoke's discussion. We\r\nhave a short paper here by Gilbert Smith on his experience with stocks,\r\nand I have asked Mr. Chase to read it. Mr. Smith began topworking\r\nseedling trees on a side hill many years ago and has trees of good size\r\nat the present time.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: This is a short discussion of several species of hickory\r\nwhich Mr. Smith has used as stocks to graft named varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Discussion of Hickory Stocks\r\n\r\nGilbert L. Smith, _Rt. 2, Millerton, N. Y._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a discussion of several species of hickory as stocks on which to\r\ngraft the named varieties of shagbark, shellbark and hybrid hickories.\r\nWe have never had any experience grafting pecan as we are too far north\r\nfor it. This paper is limited to the species with which we have had\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET PIGNUT, _Carya ovalis_\r\n\r\nThis species will be discussed first because it is the poorest stock of\r\nany of the hickory species which we have used. This is probably because\r\nit is a tetraploid while the shagbark, shellbark and hybrids are\r\ndiploids.\r\n\r\nWe have grafted many of the named varieties of hickory onto pignut\r\nstocks, using several thousand scions. We have found only one variety\r\n(the Davis shagbark) that will grow on pignut stock. We have heard of\r\none or two others but have never tried them.\r\n\r\nNearly all varieties grow well the first season but fail to leaf out the\r\nfollowing spring. They appear to winterkill. Davis has continued to grow\r\non it for over fifteen years but growth is slower than on shagbark or\r\nbitternut stocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIGNUT, _Carya glabra_\r\n\r\nI have never been able to positively identify this species of pignut.\r\nPignuts growing here vary considerably in roughness of the bark, some\r\nbeing smooth while others are as rough as the shagbark. In other\r\nrespects they are essentially the same, all having seven leaflets per\r\nleaf. However, I have observed a very few pignut trees having smooth\r\nbark and five leaflets per leaf. The leaves are finer and smaller than\r\non the seven leaflet trees.\r\n\r\nThese may be the _glabra_ species, but if so, grafting results have been\r\nno better on these than on the seven leaflet trees.\r\n\r\nAs nursery stock the pignuts are worthless. However if one has some nice\r\nyoung pignut trees growing where he wants them, it is feasible to graft\r\nthem to Davis or some other variety which has proven its ability to grow\r\non pignut stocks. It is not advisable to graft hickory trees growing in\r\ndense woods.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOCKERNUT, _Carya alba_\r\n\r\nWhile the mockernut is also a tetraploid, it is a somewhat better stock\r\nthan the pignuts, in that more of the named varieties will grow on it\r\nand as the mockernut is faster growing than the pignut, such grafts will\r\nusually grow faster.\r\n\r\nIt is of little value as a nursery stock, but if one has young mockernut\r\ntrees growing where hickory trees are wanted, they would be somewhat\r\nbetter to graft than would pignut trees. One would at least have a\r\nlarger selection of varieties and the grafts would grow faster.\r\n\r\n\r\nPECAN, _Carya illinoiensis_\r\n\r\nWhile we have read many favorable reports on the use of the pecan as a\r\nstock on which to graft shagbark, shellbark and hybrid hickories, our\r\nown experiences with it have not been very favorable. This may be due to\r\nthe fact that we have used only two varieties of shagbark on\r\npecan-stocks and may have happened to use two varieties that are not\r\nwell adapted to pecan.\r\n\r\nPecan seedlings are much faster growing than are shagbark seedlings and\r\nfor this reason would be valuable as a nursery stock if satisfactory in\r\nother respects.\r\n\r\n\r\nBITTERNUT, _Carya cordiformis_\r\n\r\nAll of our experiences with bitternut as a stock, both in the nursery\r\nand as young trees growing in permanent locations, have been very\r\nfavorable.\r\n\r\nWe have heard reports of grafts failing on bitternut stocks after a few\r\nyears growth. All such reports have come from regions considerably\r\nfarther south than our location. It may be that the bitternut does not\r\nthrive as well in the South as it does here.\r\n\r\nBitternut seedlings are much faster growing than are shagbark seedlings.\r\nThis is of considerable value in the nursery.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAGBARK, _Carya ovata_\r\n\r\nThe shagbark makes the best stock on which to graft the named varieties\r\nof shagbark, shellbark and hybrid hickories. However it has one very\r\nserious drawback in that young shagbark seedlings are so very slow\r\ngrowing. It usually takes five or more years to grow a shagbark stock\r\nfrom seed to a size large enough to graft in the nursery row.\r\n\r\nHowever, when shagbark stocks are large enough to be grafted, all of the\r\nnamed varieties we have grafted onto it have grown well.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELLBARK, _Carya laciniosa_\r\n\r\nWe have never had any experience with shellbark seedlings as stocks, but\r\nas it is so similar to the shagbark, I expect that it would make a good\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nThe production of grafted hickory trees is a serious problem in the\r\nnursery, taking many years to grow the stocks and the grafted trees are\r\ndifficult to transplant, resulting in a high rate of mortality.\r\n\r\nHowever, the grafting of young hickory trees growing in a permanent\r\nlocation is not difficult, and such grafts will grow much faster and\r\nbear younger than will grafted hickory trees from a nursery.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: My experience with bitternut stock with only two\r\nvarieties, the Strever #1 and the Champigne, has not been good. The\r\ngrafts have been stunted, the stocks have tended to sprout and make\r\nvigorous growth, and the fruiting has been sparse. Neither have I had\r\nsuccess with the pecan stock with only three varieties. The trees have\r\nbeen very slow coming into bearing and have made rather stubby growth.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: I was about to remark that we have had similar experience\r\nat Urbana with bitternut stock with pecan and shagbark varieties. It\r\nwarps the shagbark and very likely those trees won't live long. We have\r\nalready lost the Weschke hickory grafted on bitternut.\r\n\r\nMR. CRAIG: Have you tried hickory on pecan? The pecan is O. K. there.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: Tomorrow we are to have a round table on hickory\r\npropagation and suggest that further discussion of stocks might be left\r\nuntil then. Has anyone any comments on hickory varieties?\r\n\r\nMR. KEPLINGER: (North Central Michigan) I was born and raised in Saginaw\r\nCounty where the Saginaw River is fed by five or six different runs and\r\nyou have prairie farms. More hickories grow there than any place in the\r\nUnited States--enormous size. We think we have better hickories than\r\nanyone.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: Why couldn't you send some in for testing? Mr.\r\nBecker would be glad to take them. Any other discussion on hickory\r\nvarieties? How many are growing the Wilcox? (5 hands). How many find it\r\na good variety? (Two). How many have Davis? (Three). The shucks are\r\nfairly thin, compared with the Wilcox.\r\n\r\nWho else has a variety that is doing very well? We ought to have a\r\nhickory show here sometime and see who has the best hickory.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: I'd like to ask if anyone has the variety Lingenfelter.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: We have it at Ithaca; doesn't mature.\r\n\r\nDR. McKAY: We have two varieties at Beltsville that are outstanding as\r\nfar as bearing is concerned. One is Lingenfelter, which has been a\r\nconsistent bearer for us for a number of years, and the variety Shaul,\r\nthat was mentioned in Mr. Stokes' report and has been mentioned here\r\nbefore, is a very good producer.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: What species is the Shaul, is it _ovata_ or _laciniosa_?\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: It's _ovata_. It's a shagbark, as also is Lingenfelter. The\r\none characteristic that is outstanding with these two varieties with us\r\nis the fact that they bear while they are young trees; from the time our\r\ntrees were as tall as one's head, they have been full of nuts.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: Have you fruited the Weschke at Beltsville?\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: No.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: How about the Barnes?\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: I have been growing it on mockernut or white hickory. It\r\nproduces moderate crops and is the one that came into bearing about\r\nfirst on mockernut. In fact, I have several varieties on mockernut that\r\nhaven't borne yet. It's been on there about 12 years.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: The Barnes, with us, has yielded more at a younger\r\nage than any other variety, but it never filled. It began early and bore\r\nheavy crops, but the season is not long enough or hot enough.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: In Virginia they fill well, but they are not easily\r\nextracted. The shell is rather thin and fills well.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: I don't want to prolong this discussion longer\r\nthan seems profitable.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: Did I understand you to mention the variety Schinnerling?\r\n\r\nMR. GERARDI: I have got that at home. That's one that's bearing, but if\r\nit's that variety I have there, I wouldn't give it yard room.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: It is also one of our best. We have three, the Shaul, the\r\nLingenfelter that I mentioned, and the third one is Schinnerling, all\r\nthree of which are extremely heavy bearers and the three hickory\r\nvarieties that we are interested in.\r\n\r\nMR. GERARDI: How big is that Schinnerling?\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: It's an average-sized nut.\r\n\r\nMR, GERARDI: Big as your thumb?\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: Oh, yes, about an inch long, I'd say.\r\n\r\nMR. BECKER: I was wondering about the Stratford. That's not supposed to\r\nbe a pure shagbark, but it's the only one we've got, I think, that\r\nbears.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: I have the Stratford. It grows very well, but it\r\ndoesn't quite fill. What does it do with you?\r\n\r\nMR. SNYDER: It's not been doing well the last year or two. Of course,\r\nnone of them have for that matter. Used to bear tremendous crops and\r\nfilled well. I wouldn't say it's the best quality of any tree, but it's\r\neasy to graft and bears young.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: That's been my experience, that it was a young\r\nbearer and bears fairly consistently.\r\n\r\nIf there is no other discussion, on the hickories, we will close that\r\ndiscussion. We stand adjourned until this evening at 7:20.\r\n\r\nAdjournment at 4:30 o'clock, p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONDAY EVENING SESSION\r\n\r\nCalled to order at 7:20 p.m.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: We will call on Dr. McKay as chairman of the\r\nNominating Committee to present the slate of officers for the next year.\r\nDr. McKay.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: Mr. Chairman, the Nominating Committee, as you know, is\r\ncharged with the responsibility of selecting a slate of officers that\r\nwill be presented to the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe committee, composed of myself as chairman, Mr. Allaman, Mr. Silvis,\r\nMr. Ford Wilkinson and Mr. Gerardi, have the following slate of officers\r\nfor next year: For president, Mr. R. B. Best; for vice-president, Mr.\r\nGeorge Salzer of Rochester; for secretary, Mr. Spencer Chase; for\r\ntreasurer, Mr. Carl Prell.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: You have heard the report of the Nominating\r\nCommittee. At this time we will entertain further nominations from the\r\nfloor, if any.\r\n\r\nThe only action to be taken now is to accept the report of the\r\nNominating Committee. Do I hear such a motion?\r\n\r\nThe motion to accept the report was moved, seconded and carried.\r\n\r\nGoing on with the program of the evening, are you ready to show the\r\nfilm?\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: The film comes to us from the Northwest Nut Growers now\r\nlocated in Portland, Oregon. They are an organization for marketing\r\nfilberts, and you will see, \"The Filbert Valleys\", the title. I haven't\r\nseen it myself and don't know exactly what the contents are. We will\r\nlook at it now and judge for ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe film, \"The Filbert Valleys\", was shown.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: We appreciate very much your running it.\r\n\r\nThe next item will be our discussion of filbert varieties and their\r\nculture. Mildred Jones, who was to be here, could not come. She\r\ntelephoned the last minute that she was ill and could not be with us. I\r\nhave asked George Slate to be the moderator in the discussion, with his\r\npanel, D. C. Snyder, Raymond Silvis, A. M. Whitford, Louis Gerardi and\r\nH. F. Stoke.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: I just learned when I arrived here that I was to be on this\r\ndiscussion group, and I learned a few minutes ago that I was to lead it,\r\nso I can assure you that this is wholly unrehearsed, and I may have to\r\nflounder around a bit before we get things running smoothly.\r\n\r\nI thought I might review the variety situation rather briefly. We have\r\ndone quite a lot of variety testing of filberts at Geneva; in fact,\r\nabout the only nut cultural work we have done at Geneva has been the\r\nfilbert project. We started out with about 25 or 30 varieties that we\r\nsecured from American nurseries, many of them from a firm in Rochester\r\nwhich imported them from Germany. Later we added varieties from England,\r\nFrance and Germany. I picked up nearly all the varieties that I could\r\nlocate until we had about 120 varieties growing there at Geneva. These\r\nwere there for some years, and it became evident that many of them were\r\nnot of great value. Then we had a hard winter in 1933 and 1934, and\r\nalthough it did not kill the trees, most of them were blackhearted and\r\nbegan going back soon after that. However, I felt at that time that I\r\nknew enough about the varieties to discard most of them. Many of them\r\nwere discarded because they had poor nuts, many of them were\r\nunproductive, and many of them lacked hardiness of catkins. I laid a\r\ngreat deal of emphasis on the hardiness of catkins in testing the\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nOut of that variety test were three varieties which we considered to be\r\nmost satisfactory of the lot. These were Cosford, an English variety,\r\nrather a small nut but very thin-shelled. The catkins were hardy and one\r\nof the heavier croppers of the lot. Medium Long, a nut which I believe\r\noriginated as a seedling in Rochester, was another one, and Italian Red,\r\nwhich later proved to be Gustav's Zellernuss, a German variety, was\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nAs a result of that variety test it became evident that varieties from\r\nGermany, many of which originated in the colder portions of Germany and\r\nNorthern Germany, were distinctly more hardy than the varieties that we\r\ngot from French sources and English sources. In some of the proceedings\r\nof the Association published during the '30's I have reported on the\r\ndifferent varieties and their hardiness and those varieties that I\r\nthought were most valuable. I don't recall the names of many of those\r\nGerman varieties. These three varieties which we consider the best of\r\nthe lot were turned over to the New York Fruit Testing Association to\r\npropagate and distribute, because they were not available from American\r\nnurseries. I am not sure how many of them were available from other\r\nsources, but they are still available from the Fruit Testing\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nThen out of that variety test a grading project developed. We got our\r\nstart from about 500 seedlings that Clarence Reed sent us in the early\r\n'30's. We made crosses there at Geneva, using the Rush variety of\r\n_Corylus americana_ as the seed parent in many cases. We also made some\r\ncrosses between _Corylus avellana_ varieties, and with these seedlings\r\nfrom Mr. Reed and seedlings of our own crossing, we have grown about\r\n2,000 filbert seedlings there at Geneva. These have all been evaluated\r\nand discarded, except possibly 30 or 35 selections still on hand, some\r\nof them being propagated for a second test planting. Stock of one or two\r\nhas been turned over to the Fruit Testing Association for increase and\r\neventual naming and introduction.\r\n\r\nThe work of the United States Department of Agriculture was along\r\nsimilar lines. Mr. Reed did not send us all of his seedlings. A number\r\nof them were fruited at Beltsville, and from that work at Beltsville I\r\nbelieve two varieties have been named, Reed and Potomac. I am not sure\r\nwhether they are available yet from commercial sources.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: Two of them are.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: Mr. Graham of Ithaca, a long-time member of this Association\r\nand very much interested in filberts, had also made some crosses and\r\nraised several hundred seedlings. He used the Winkler variety as a seed\r\nparent. I believe he raised some seedlings of the Jones hybrids, which\r\nwould make that material second generation stock from the original cross\r\nbetween Rush and the _avellana_ varieties.\r\n\r\nMr. Graham's planting was in rather a cold area; he had considerable\r\nwinter killing. Eventually filbert blight got into his planting, and it\r\nreally cleaned house. There were a very few seedlings in his planting\r\nwhich remained free of filbert blight. I think it is a fairly safe guess\r\nto say that they were probably very resistant to blight. So far these\r\nhave not been propagated to any extent.\r\n\r\nThere are a few cultural problems. The ones that we have encountered at\r\nGeneva have been winter injury, particularly of the catkins, and also\r\nsome of them have not been as hardy in wood as we would like. We have\r\nhad no trouble with filbert blight, presumably because we are isolated\r\nfrom the wild hazel, which harbors this blight. Dr. MacDaniels has had\r\ntrouble with his planting at Ithaca with filbert mite.\r\n\r\nWith this introduction, which is mostly varieties and breeding, because\r\nthat seems to be my interest, I'd like to call on some members of the\r\npanel to get their experiences. Mr. Snyder raises nut trees in Iowa\r\nwhere winter injury is probably much more serious than we have at\r\nGeneva. At Geneva we have a fairly respectable climate and can get a\r\ncrop of peaches about nine years out of ten. In Iowa they have a lot\r\nmore sunshine, and I think probably sharper drops of temperature than we\r\nhave at Geneva. I'd like to have Mr. Snyder tell us what his experiences\r\nhave been with filbert varieties.\r\n\r\nMR. SNYDER: I really didn't know that I was to be on this panel until I\r\ngot here. I thought I was on the hickory panel. As Mr. Slate says, our\r\nclimate is more severe that that at Geneva. We can get the very hardiest\r\npeaches to bear about two years out of three, and the trees are severely\r\ninjured in between. So that will give you a little idea as to the\r\nclimate in that respect.\r\n\r\nWe made quite a planting at one time, maybe 30 of the Jones hybrids, and\r\nthey did quite well for several years, and then between the\r\nwinter-killing and the blight most of them are dead now. The Winkler, of\r\ncourse, is an Iowa nut and was introduced by our people and did very\r\nwell for a number of years but has backed out on us the last several\r\nyears, too, I believe due to this same mite trouble that Dr. MacDaniels\r\nreports in New York. They just don't bear. The bushes are quite healthy,\r\nand we get plenty of catkins, but we don't get any nuts to amount to\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nWe have a little bush of the Mandchurian hazel. It isn't worth\r\nmentioning as a nut producer, but it does have very attractive foliage\r\nand seems to be entirely healthy, produces perhaps three to five nuts a\r\nyear on a bush as high as your head. You may be familiar with it. The\r\nfoliage is very distinct from anything I know. The leaves are truncate\r\nat the end, cut off quite square, with just a little point in the\r\nmiddle.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: I don't have that.\r\n\r\nMR. SNYDER: That is standing our conditions all right, and several years\r\nago Mr. Reed sent us what he said at the time were Chinese tree hazels,\r\nbut later he retracted and said that they were not Chinese tree hazels\r\nbut they were hybrids of the Chinese tree hazel. There were four of\r\nthose plants; one of them was a tremendous grower. It would grow six\r\nfeet or more a year and commence bearing in a year or two. But the\r\nblight hit it and cleaned it out. There is only one left now, one of the\r\nslower-growing ones, and while it promises to become a tree, it is a\r\nvery irregular-growing one. I think it had half a dozen nuts on this\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish tree hazel, of which I have two trees, were very badly\r\ndamaged by a very severe hailstorm 12 or 15 years ago, which completely\r\npeeled off the bark on one side. That was in early July, and we were\r\nafraid to cut them off and let them grow up new for fear it would kill\r\nthem. They have finally developed into quite beautiful upright trees.\r\nAlso they have more than one stem from the bottom. One of them produces\r\na great abundance of catkins, but neither of them has produced any nuts\r\nyet, and they are 14 feet high or more, good-sized trees and very\r\nattractive. The foliage is very beautiful, and it remains healthy. I\r\ndon't know that there are any other varieties that I can name.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: We have had several of the Turkish tree hazels, _Corylus\r\ncolurna_, growing at Geneva for two or three years. They came from the\r\nRochester State Park. We have one tree which Mr. Bixby imported from\r\nChina, as _Corylus chinensis_, but recently I had it checked by Dr.\r\nLawrence of the Bailey Hortorium and he assured me that it was _Corylus\r\ncolurna_. I think these make a very handsome tree. I like that rough,\r\ncorky bark they have as they get older. The trees in Highland Park at\r\nRochester are the largest, perhaps, in the country, certainly the\r\nlargest that I know anything about. They are at least as large as a very\r\nlarge apple tree. They have been fruiting for some years. The trees at\r\nGeneva have not fruited very much. I don't think you can expect much in\r\nthe way of nuts until the tree is about 15 years old. This year one of\r\nour trees has a number of nuts on it. The nuts are too small and too\r\nthick-shelled to be of any great value for nuts.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Whitford, you have had some experience with the filbert\r\nvarieties. Which one would you recommend?\r\n\r\nMR. WHITFORD: I haven't had a whole lot of experience with the filberts,\r\nbut we had some of the old varieties, like Barcelona and DuChilly, and\r\nthey didn't bear many nuts, and eventually they went out with blight.\r\nAnd we have some of the Potomac and Reed, about five years old, and they\r\ndon't bear well as yet. I don't know what the outcome is going to be on\r\nthe Potomac and Reed. They make a nice ornamental bush, anyway, and\r\nthat's about the sum and substance of my experience with filberts.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: The Barcelona and DuChilly at Geneva have not been very\r\nsatisfactory. During the first two years Barcelona outyielded the other\r\nvarieties, but as the trees became older they experienced winter injury.\r\nDuChilly or Kentish Cob makes a small tree, but the nut is about the\r\nbest of the nuts. There is a German variety not in circulation in this\r\ncountry, Langsdorfer, which is much like DuChilly, but it seems to make\r\na much better tree. I think if they were put into circulation it might\r\nbe a good substitute here in the East for DuChilly variety.\r\n\r\nLet's hear from you, Mr. Gerardi. I know you are testing filbert\r\nvarieties now.\r\n\r\nMR. GERARDI: Yes, I have DuChilly and Kentish Cob. So far, at our place\r\nwe have no blight or mite damage to speak of. The original plantings\r\nwere the Bixby and Buchanan. We have them yet, and they are still as\r\nhealthy as the day we put them out. They show no damage; even the\r\nWinkler hazel has had no damage or disease. It may be the soil, although\r\nwe have them on high ground and low ground both. Among the newer ones\r\nthis year the Reed has the most on. The Potomac, though it is the\r\nstrongest grower of the two, has less nuts. Although it appeared to me\r\nthat the catkins were all killed in February of this year, still we have\r\nsome nuts. The Jones hybrids, when the catkins are killed, have very\r\nfew, if any nuts. Some years we have a crop, if some of the catkins are\r\nheld back and bloom late. Winter killing in February before they have\r\nhad a chance to pollinate, has been our main trouble. If we could get a\r\nvariety that this wouldn't bother, we'd have what we are looking for.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: The Winkler will bloom for you almost every year. Doesn't\r\nthe Winkler hold its catkins most years?\r\n\r\nMR. GERARDI: Yes, sir, I'd say at our place the Winkler has never failed\r\nentirely. Even though the catkins are killed, they still bear quite\r\nregularly.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: I can say that for it at Urbana.\r\n\r\nMR. WHITFORD: The catkins might have been killed, but you might have had\r\nsome cross-pollination from other sources.\r\n\r\nMR. GERARDI: There is a chance of that, of course. There is a wild hazel\r\nwithin a quarter of a mile, but apparently the wild hazel bloomed first.\r\nThey were on a south slope and naturally came out first. I tried to keep\r\nthem on the north slope, or on the cool side of any particular planting,\r\nbecause if you can hold them back more, you have got a better chance. If\r\nyou plant them on the south side, you rarely get anything.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: The hybrids bloom later than the _avellana_ varieties, and\r\nthey mature nuts later. Is that your experience?\r\n\r\nMR. GERARDI: That's true, I will admit your hybrids are a little later\r\nblooming, because your American hazel nuts around our place bloom very\r\nearly, sometimes in January in full bloom.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: _C. avellana_ starts blooming in March and blooms for about a\r\nmonth. Some years when you have had considerable open weather, they have\r\nbloomed as early as the middle of February. They will, of course, stand\r\nconsiderable freezing when they are in bloom.\r\n\r\nAs regards the pollination, I believe about all the information we have\r\nis the work that was done at the Oregon Experiment Station a number of\r\nyears ago. All of the varieties tried were self-unfruitful or\r\nself-incompatible. The term, \"self-sterile\" is often used, but I think\r\nit is a little more exact to say self-unfruitful or self-incompatible.\r\nThey are not sterile, because the pistillate flowers are normal and so\r\nis the pollen produced by the staminate flowers. It's just a question of\r\ninability of the pollen to fertilize the pistillate flowers on the same\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nWe know nothing about the pollination requirements of any of these\r\n_Corylus avellana_ or _Corylus americana_ hybrids. We do know that when\r\nthe cross is made that the _Corylus americana_ variety must be the\r\nseed-parent. The cross doesn't work the other way around. That's about\r\nall we know about the cross-pollination of these filberts.\r\n\r\nMR. SAWYER: We have had them to bloom in April or the first week in May.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: The seedlings?\r\n\r\nMR. SAWYER: The seedlings.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: What is the origin of the seedlings?\r\n\r\nMR. SAWYER: They are the natives.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: The native _C. rostrata_, or _C. cornuta_ to some botanists,\r\nit seems to me has nothing that we want in the way of a nut, if we can\r\npossibly grow these other varieties, the _americana_ selections or the\r\nhybrids. It's a miserable little nut with that long, prickly husk. It's\r\nvery difficult to get the nut out of it. For that reason, I have never\r\nbeen very much interested in it.\r\n\r\nMR. SAWYER: How is the Ryan?\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: Mr. Gellatly out in British Columbia has named several\r\nhybrids between _avellana_ and the _Corylus cornuta_. Have you seen it?\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: No, I haven't seen it.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: They described them in their catalog.\r\n\r\nMR. COLBY: I have preference for the Winkler hazel, as you know. I\r\nbought and put them in the greenhouse several years ago and shook the\r\npollen on the pistils and got a full set. So I felt that was\r\nself-fruitful.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: That was pretty good evidence, then, that it was\r\nself-fruitful.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Silvis, you raise nut trees, and the climate is somewhat like\r\nthat in Western New York, perhaps a little milder in the winter. What\r\nhave you to say about the filbert varieties?\r\n\r\nMR. SILVIS: It's Warmer, and in spite of all the statistics of previous\r\ngentlemen, I find that _avellana_ types which I had growing in my back\r\nyard three years ago produced pollen on January the 25th. It was\r\nunseasonably warm. It was 70 degrees, and most of the pollen was\r\ndispersed. And this year I found the wild hazel pollen much later than\r\nthe early types, due to the different situation. The wild ones which I\r\nhad seen were growing in semi shade under tall trees, and my bushes and\r\nplants are growing in the back yard south of our house. And I think I\r\nhave the largest planting in the State of Ohio, about two dozen plants,\r\nand I am in production.\r\n\r\nBesides numerous seedlings, I have the following varieties: Italian Red,\r\nCosford, Medium Long, DuChilly. They are in bearing. Italian Red and\r\nDuChilly planted together, I believe, are good for one another for the\r\nproduction of nice filbert nuts. I have, from scion wood you sent me\r\nseveral years ago, Cosford, and now on their own roots Neue Riesenuss,\r\nand what I thought the tag said, not \"Langsdorfer,\" but Langsberger.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: There is a Langsdorfer, and I think there is another variety\r\nwhich Langsberg is part of the name. I am not sure, I will have to look\r\nthat up.\r\n\r\nMR. SILVIS: Well, I have it as Langsberger. I have shown last evening\r\nthe picture of Harry L. Pierce's orchard at Willamette in Oregon, or in\r\nSalem, Oregon. I have one of his trees with staminate blooms only, no\r\npistillate blooms. But I also have what Fayette Etter in Pennsylvania\r\ncalls his Royal, and I just cannot get two fellows together with paper\r\nand pencil to determine whether those two Royals are the same, but I am\r\nhoping to find out whether the two Royals are identical. I had Fayette\r\nEtter find me scion wood, and now I have it growing as a graft and\r\nlayered on its own roots.\r\n\r\nI think you people do yourselves an injustice by not learning to graft\r\nand learning to work with the filbert. You only have to have three\r\ncompatible plants. If you have more, you will have more nuts. I see no\r\nreason why anyone who owns a city lot cannot grow filberts. They are\r\nmuch easier to take care of, and you are not going to prejudice the\r\nplant by having it associate with its wild cousin, and I think you will\r\nfind a lot of enjoyment in the filbert bush.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: What variety do you think is best? What two or three would\r\nyou plant?\r\n\r\nMR. SILVIS: For eating I like DuChilly, and the catkin is hardy with me,\r\nand I am between the 40th and 41st parallel. I'd say anyone who lives\r\nfrom Iowa to the East Coast within one hundred miles north or south of\r\nthe 40th parallel should have the same luck that I have. And as to a\r\ngroup planting, I would suggest, as you recommended to me when we first\r\nstarted out the Medium Long, Cosford and Italian Red. If you want only\r\ntwo bushes, Italian Red and DuChilly will work well together.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: Do you have Medium Long?\r\n\r\nMR. SILVIS: Yes, I do.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: Is that doing well?\r\n\r\nMR. SILVIS: I don't think it fruits as well as Cosford or DuChilly.\r\nThat's been my experience. My DuChilly was plastered with nuts last year\r\nand this year, and I believe it's due to the Italian Red which New York\r\nFruit Testing Laboratory sold me.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: Thank you.\r\n\r\nMR. WHITFORD: Do you fertilize those bushes?\r\n\r\nMR. SILVIS: Due to the fact I have started to mulch with sawdust I have\r\nbeen using nitrate and rock phosphate, so my teeth don't fall out when I\r\nchew them.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: I crack mine with a hand cracker, I don't crack them with my\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nDR. COLBY: Mr. Chairman, we can grow filberts. How does the chairman\r\nkeep the squirrels from eating them?\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: I will tell you that.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: Mr. Stoke raises his nut trees in the Sunny South, and he has\r\nproblems down there that we don't have up north. I think he has to worry\r\na lot more about winter killing than we do way up north where we are in\r\nCentral New York. What's been your experience with some of the varieties\r\nand what are your principal cultural problems with the filberts?\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: I wish to answer Dr. Colby's query about squirrels. I find\r\nthat squirrels are very highly allergic to these BB caps or the CP caps\r\nused in a 22 rifle. It works. In my back yard there is a Brixnut\r\nfilbert, which originated in Oregon. I guess it's been there 15 years.\r\nThere are four trunks to it, the largest about 16 inches in diameter.\r\nOne of those I grafted to Giant, as a pollinizer for Brixnut. It's\r\nsimilar in shape, somewhat smaller in spite of its name, but it's pretty\r\neffective. Then about ten years ago there was an old gentleman from\r\nHalsey, Oregon. I don't know whether any of you have corresponded with\r\nhim or not. He bought the Breslau Persian walnut--I pretty nearly said\r\nthe English walnut, and I'd have been disgraced--and furnished me scions\r\nand I got a start of it from him. Russ sent me some scions from a\r\nfilbert he called Jumbo. You will see it out on the table there. It's\r\nrather a long nut, little larger than DuChilly and not quite so flat,\r\nthat I grafted in there. It absolutely is hopeless as a pollinizer for\r\nanything, because it loses its staminate blossoms by Christmas. But the\r\nHall's Giant pollinizes them, and it's the best filbert I have, all\r\nthings considered. This year off that one scion--of course, it's four\r\ninches in diameter--I got about 7 quarts of nuts, and they began\r\nripening at least three weeks ago, and the crop is all off now. And the\r\nfoliage is unusually heavy, almost in clusters, and it drops cleanly and\r\nfreely from the husks, and I think it is a very nice filbert. Whether\r\nit's a recognized variety in the West I have no idea, and I haven't\r\ncorresponded with the old gentleman for some years, and he probably has\r\npassed on by this time, because he was an elderly man and not in good\r\nhealth at the time I had my correspondence with him. I consider that an\r\nexcellent filbert, and I think anyone wishing to plant filberts should\r\ninvestigate with the Oregon nurseries or Washington nurseries and see if\r\nthat is a recognized variety. I tried to find out once and failed so\r\nfar. I do not have it on its own roots. I hope that I will have it\r\nrooted in another year.\r\n\r\nIn my back yard also I have one that I bought in Oregon. That's as tall\r\nas up to that beam, maybe almost to the ceiling, very vigorous growth,\r\nlarger nut than Longfellow, thicker nuts and also longer. But I think\r\nthe thing he sold me was a graft and the graft died and this came from\r\nthe root. It bears very sparingly, but it's a very large nut, and I\r\nwondered why it was always so spare, and I caught it blooming in\r\nDecember, staminate blossoms in December this year. So that's that.\r\n\r\nTen miles east of my home, east of the Blue Ridge Mountains in the\r\ngranitic, very heavy clay soil of what we call the Piedmont down there,\r\nI have a planting that was made 15 years ago of filberts, some on their\r\nown roots and some that I grew on the Turkish tree hazel stocks. Those\r\ngrew well, and the main advantage was they put up no suckers. You had a\r\nnice clean trunk, and you didn't have that problem of getting rid of the\r\nsprouts all the time. And it looked very good for a while.\r\n\r\nI find where you graft that way, the stocks get old and do not renew\r\nthemselves, and eventually the life will be shorter than if you had a\r\nshrub that might last for a century, when you are renewing your stalks\r\nwhen they reach maturity and cease to grow enough to be productive.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago I had most of the standard varieties you mentioned here in\r\nthat planting, about three-quarters or perhaps an acre planted in\r\nbetween chestnut trees. Planted the chestnut trees 40 feet apart and\r\nthen interplanted with the filberts at 20 feet. Two years ago we had an\r\nunusually wet season, and the blight, of which I had had some before,\r\nhit hard and virtually ruined the whole planting. And in addition to\r\nthat, we have leaf miner. It's an insect that lays a tiny egg in the\r\nleaf and develops a little larva or worm that eats out the chlorophyll\r\nbetween the two membranes of the leaf, just hollows it out and makes\r\nunsightly spots in there and, of course, kills that portion of the leaf.\r\nBut the blight, known as the eastern filbert blight, according to Mr.\r\nGravatt, has just ruined that planting. Some of the trees have been\r\nkilled outright, and most of the tops are either dead or dying. This\r\nyear the blight wasn't apparently active on the living part, because it\r\nwas very dry up until the first of August, and since then it's been very\r\nwet. That's what happened to my filberts there.\r\n\r\nNow, in that same location I have some younger, second-generation or\r\nthird-generation plantings that I grew from scions from the Jones\r\nhybrids and so far those have not been attacked by the blight and not\r\nmuch by the leaf miner. I used them to replace some of the others that\r\nhad died several years ago, so they are right in there together. About\r\nthe best I have of those are also on exhibit out there and marked as the\r\nJones Hybrid.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I put out some seedling Colurna or the Turkish tree\r\nhazel in that same plot. They were attacked somewhat but not badly by\r\nthe blight. Today you'd never know they had any blight. They look\r\nhealthy, and as has already been said, they make a beautiful tree. And\r\nif you want an avenue of trees on a drive that don't spread too wide and\r\nrun up like Lombardi poplar, they'll beat Lombardi poplar all to pieces.\r\nAnd if you crowd them a little, they will grow up like a spire and\r\nretain their branches, so you really have a tree.\r\n\r\nThere was one in the J. F. Jones yard at Lancaster that I think was at\r\nleast 14 inches in trunk diameter 20 years ago when I saw it. Do you\r\nknow whether that is still there at the Jones place, that Turkish tree\r\nhazel, Mrs. Weber?\r\n\r\nMRS. WEBER: Where is it located?\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: It's right near the house, it seems to me between the house\r\nand the side near the barn.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: Mr. Stoke, that tree is gone. We were there last fall.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: But it was a very nice tree, and for shade it's very nice.\r\nThe Manchurian hazel has been spoken of, and I might mention that,\r\nbecause I have dabbled in everything, I guess. I got seed from the\r\nUniversity of Nanking along with some other things, and those seedlings\r\nwere quite variable. The nuts compared rather favorably with the\r\nAmerican hazel. Some were thick-shelled, but they will average almost as\r\ngood as the American hazel, and they bore quite freely for me until I\r\nlet the bushes get right thick. They will send out suckers and make a\r\nvery spreading growth. If you dig them out and leave a piece of root in\r\nthe ground, it will come up just like sassafras or persimmon will on\r\nthat piece of root. But it is an attractive bush, and mine has a\r\nreddish-brown little spot in the middle of the leaf in most cases. It\r\nseems to be characteristic of that strain that I have. The nuts were\r\nquite variable and, as I say, they bore right well until I let them get\r\ntoo thick. I believe that's all.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: I neglected to answer your question, Dr. Colby, but the\r\nsquirrels have not been much of a problem with our filberts at Geneva,\r\nstrange as it may seem. They have never taken a very high percentage of\r\nthe crop. We have a Lancaster heartnut, and they clean up every nut on\r\nthat tree every year before the end of August.\r\n\r\nI'd like to comment on this matter of the name of Halle's Giant, I think\r\nyou called it. I think the name is Halle, the German town where the\r\nvariety originated. I prefer the name Halle, because calling it Hall's\r\nGiant is more or less a sign its origin is a man named Hall.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: In some catalogs it is one way and some the other.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: We have other items on the program tonight, and as the Latin\r\nstudent said, \"Tempus is fugiting very fast,\" so I think we had better\r\nturn the meeting back to Dr. MacDaniels.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MACDANIELS: The next two talks have slides to be shown, and it\r\nis suggested that you take about ten minutes, take a stretch and then\r\ncome back when the slide projector is set up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Experiences With Chinese Chestnuts\r\n\r\nW. J. WILSON, _Fort Valley, Ga._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was asked to appear on this program to tell my experiences as a\r\ngrower of chestnuts, I felt like a child, appearing before a group of\r\ngrown-ups to tell them how to make marriage succeed. When I see the\r\nsages of chestnut knowledge seated before me I realize that I can only\r\nrelate my experiences and ask your advice.\r\n\r\nMy father was a pioneer peach and pecan grower; he loved trees and has\r\ntold me time after time that if I ever made more than just a living,\r\nfarming, it would have to come from trees, not row crops. He was what I\r\nwould call a self-educated man. He had small chance of formal education,\r\nbeing the sickly son, one of eight sons and three daughters, of a couple\r\nwho eked out an existence on the poor, unproductive, sandy, soils of\r\nCrawford County, Georgia, growing the one and only cash crop of those\r\ndays, cotton. The combined wages of these boys often amounted to more\r\ncash money than their own cotton crop returned because the supplier got\r\nmost of the money from their own crop. They helped neighbors pick out\r\ntheir cotton crops after finishing their own. Grandfather must have\r\nliked to experiment in his limited way. Each spring as Grandfather would\r\nplant his small patch of Spanish peanuts and yellow corn, Grandmother\r\nwould tongue-lash him, saying, 'so long as you fool away your time with\r\nSpanish peanuts and yellow corn you will remain a poor man. Time has\r\nproven Grandfather right and Grandmother wrong. Spanish peanuts is a\r\nhuge industry; most of our hybrid corns, which have added millions of\r\nbushels to our yields are yellow.\r\n\r\nMy father wasted his time back at the turn of the century planting a\r\npeach orchard on his best cotton land. He planted pecans each winter,\r\nbeginning about 1912, often to the ribbing of friends who still\r\nworshipped at the feet of King Cotton. One told him that he had a pecan\r\ntree or two about his home and the damn flying squirrels ate all of the\r\nnuts. Another told him that if he wanted a load of stove wood he would\r\njust as soon cut down a pecan tree as any other kind. At his death in\r\n1942, my father had planted six hundred acres of pecan orchards, each\r\nacre having been interplanted with peaches, to produce income while the\r\npecans were reaching bearing age.\r\n\r\nI give you this background so that you may better understand my attitude\r\ntoward chestnut growing. The scale on which I have set out on chestnut\r\ngrowing I know to some of you will seem rather bold or foolhardy.\r\n\r\nAbout ten years ago I found that the U. S. D. A. Pecan Experiment\r\nStation at Albany, Georgia had a small chestnut orchard. Max Hardy, was\r\ndoing the chestnut work and was so much interested in them that I caught\r\nfire and have been burning ever since. When I found that the harvest\r\ncame between the peach harvest and the pecan harvest it fitted right\r\ninto my kind of farming. The fact, that it was a possible tree crop made\r\nchestnut growing still more attractive to me. Max suggested that I join\r\nthe N. N. G. A. when I complained that I couldn't find much information\r\non chestnuts. I attended my first convention at Norris. I have tried to\r\nmake most of them since that time. Of all the discussions at the Norris\r\nmeeting, the one that stuck in my mind was whether nurseries should\r\nrecommend seedlings or grafted trees. I thought then, and still think,\r\nthat for commercial production one must have varieties, because\r\nseedlings are so variable. I believe, that when, chestnut growing comes\r\nof age, the major part of the production will go through processing\r\nplants. It will be a great advantage to have nuts of uniform quality and\r\nsize, which is and will be impossible with seedlings.\r\n\r\nOf the fifteen trees that I planted in 1946, only one fruited in 1951.\r\nIt bore only 3-1/4 pounds of nuts. The other fourteen did not fruit.\r\nThis year there are a few scattering burs at seven years of age, on\r\nthose that I did not graft this spring. I am now too old to wait seven\r\nor eight years for a chestnut tree to begin bearing. These trees came\r\nfrom a Virginia nursery. The trees I planted in 1947, I started grafting\r\nin 1950, to Nanking, Meiling, and Kuling, and finished this spring,\r\nexcept for a few replants. I also grafted ten trees in 1950 to\r\nAbundance. These tops bore the second year, several bearing good burs\r\nthe same year the scions were set. These grafted trees are anxious to go\r\nto work, because they bloom in the spring and again in late July and\r\nearly August. I have used the in-lay bark, modified cleft, the cleft,\r\nand what I call a saddle graft, bevelling two sides of the stock and\r\nsplitting the scion, thus slipping the split scion down over the\r\nprepared stock. I have had equally good take on all types of grafts\r\nused. In 1948 I planted two hundred seedlings bought from Max Hardy,\r\ngrown from seed from the Experiment Station orchard. I believe the\r\nproduction record of this orchard has been given to this convention at\r\nprevious meetings. You will recall that the off-type trees were rogued,\r\nleaving the parent trees of Nanking, Kuling and Meiling and others of\r\ngood bearing habits. In 1951 four trees out of this lot, were\r\noutstanding in precocity. The earliest started dropping nuts the\r\nfifteenth of August and bore 7-1/4 pounds. The next matured September\r\n5th and produced 8-1/2 pounds. The third tree is unusual. I noticed it\r\nthe 4th of October. The ground was covered with nuts, but only an\r\noccasional bur. All of the burs were wide open and still on the tree.\r\nThe crop weighed 6-1/2 pounds. The fourth tree I found on the 5th of\r\nOctober with all of its nuts on the ground, the tree retaining the burs.\r\nThe yield of this tree was 4-1/2 pounds. Mind you, this was the fourth\r\nsummer after planting. These trees have repeated this year with another\r\ngood heavy crop. The other trees in this block bore from none to one or\r\ntwo pounds of nuts in 1951. This year less than ten trees in the block\r\nare not bearing. Next spring these ten will be growing new tops, because\r\ntheir present tops are not satisfactory. I noticed that one tree in this\r\nblock bloomed long after the rest this spring, several weeks in fact. It\r\nmight have possibilities in northern areas because of its late blooming.\r\n\r\nOf the eleven hundred trees planted in 1950, one bore nuts in 1951. I\r\ndidn't know it until this spring, when I was pruning the trees in this\r\nblock, and found nuts on the ground under this tree. It is bearing a\r\ngood crop this year for its size and age. There are a number of these\r\ntrees bearing this year. Dr. Crane in a hurried inspection of these\r\ntrees this summer thought those trees bearing were offspring of a\r\ncertain tree in the Philema orchard.\r\n\r\nI do not give my chestnut trees special care. They are fertilized and\r\ncultivated the same as young peach orchards. We try to bring in a peach\r\norchard the third summer, with enough fruit to make it worth spraying. I\r\nsee no reason to wait seven or eight years to get a chestnut orchard\r\ninto bearing. If you will keep down competition from weeds, cultivate\r\nfrequently, and give the tree plenty of nitrogen you will be surprised\r\nat the growth it will make. I set the trees twenty-four feet each way,\r\nwith the idea of thinning later when they begin to crowd. In this way I\r\nwill get higher acre yields in the early years. When they reach maturity\r\nI will have them thinned down to forty-eight feet each way. As they\r\nreach heavy bearing the rate of growth will slow down and I will adjust\r\nthe nitrogen to keep them from becoming too vegetative.\r\n\r\nSo far the only insects that have bothered me are caterpillars that\r\nordinarily feed on wild maypops, or passion flowers. These caterpillars\r\nwill defoliate a tree. The only tree that I have lost from\r\nwinter-killing was one defoliated by the caterpillars early last fall.\r\nIt may become necessary for me to spray for these worms if they become\r\ntoo plentiful.\r\n\r\nI do not come before you as an authority on chestnut growing. I feel\r\nthat to force myself to do my best I should plant enough trees to make\r\nme find out how to handle them. In the rush and bustle of peach and\r\npecan growing if I had only a few chestnut trees I might decide that not\r\nmuch was involved, and neglect the chestnuts. I know that with two\r\nthousand trees already planted and some of them bearing I am going to\r\nmake a great effort to make the project profitable. I have decided that\r\nchestnut growing has possibilities as a tree crop in my section, and is\r\nworth my time and effort. I know there are many problems ahead, but so\r\ndid my father when he planted peaches and pecans many years ago. I am\r\nstill meeting new problems with them each year. Problems go hand in hand\r\nwith the fruit and nut business. It is the fellow who is willing to try\r\nto work them out who has a chance to profit. If I wait until all the\r\nproblems are solved I will never grow chestnuts. The day that I decide\r\nthat I know all the answers about growing peaches, pecans or chestnuts,\r\nis the day I start going broke. I have been badly bent several times\r\nwhile I was struggling to find an answer. Each year starts full of hope,\r\nwith visions of a nice fat bank balance when the jobs are all done. Then\r\nthe problems start and if I can lick enough of them, I come through with\r\nthe right to see if I can't do a still better job next year, despite the\r\nrisks of too much rain, not enough rain, hail, insects and diseases.\r\n\r\nI have found that each year from 15 to 50 million pounds of chestnuts\r\nare imported from Europe. The same blight that destroyed our native\r\nchestnuts, is going full tilt in Italy and other European countries. If\r\nthe blight runs its course as it did in this country, it will not be\r\nmany years until we will not have chestnuts from Europe. I am going to\r\ngrow some to fill this gap. In 1950 Dr. McKay sent me eight trees, four\r\nMeiling, two Nanking, two Kuling. Two Meiling and two Nanking to be\r\nplanted together, two Meiling and two Kuling together. Each combination\r\nto be isolated so that the nuts produced would be of known crosses.\r\nThese trees bloomed this spring and two of them set a few burs. Next\r\nyear I hope to turn over to Dr. McKay nuts from these trees to be\r\nplanted, and grown to fruiting age. I now have about one hundred and\r\nsixty grafted trees. I intend to fruit my seedlings with the hope that\r\namong them I will find trees superior enough to be given variety status.\r\nI will then top-work the rest to varieties. At present I intend to plant\r\nmore trees each winter until I have at least one hundred acres of\r\norchards. If and when the weevil moves in I will have the equipment on\r\nhand to spray, using the same equipment on peaches or pecans.\r\n\r\nI would like to see this Association ask that more research on chestnut\r\nproduction be done by the U. S. D. A. It will not be done until we ask\r\nfor it. The men in the department are not in position to do much asking\r\nfor additional funds. It is the responsibility of groups like the N. N.\r\nG. A. and the Southeastern Chestnut Grower's Association. We are in need\r\nof more breeding and selection of new, and better adapted varieties. We\r\nneed processing research, marketing research, and research in the field\r\nof production. We are not going to get it done until we insist on it\r\ngood and strong.\r\n\r\nThis spring, at Fort Valley, Georgia, the Southeastern Chestnut Grower's\r\nAssociation was formed. We hold our convention in March and will be glad\r\nto have everyone interested in chestnut growing, marketing, processing\r\nor research, attend our convention. I think in time this organization\r\nwill want to become affiliated with the N. N. G. A., to the mutual\r\nbenefit of both. I will be glad to have any of you visit my orchards and\r\nshow me how to grow chestnuts, I am constantly searching for\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MACDANIELS: We thank Mr. Wilson very much for his talk, and\r\nwe think it does take a lot of courage to embark on an experiment of\r\nthat kind.\r\n\r\nIn view of the lateness of the hour, unless somebody objects, we will\r\nadjourn until tomorrow morning at 8:30.\r\n\r\nAt 9:40 o'clock, p.m., the meeting adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY MORNING SESSION\r\n\r\n\r\n(Called to order at 8:30 o'clock, a.m., President L. H. MacDaniels\r\npresiding.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPersian Walnuts in the Upper South\r\n\r\nH. F. STOKE, _Roanoke, Va._\r\n\r\n\r\nMy experience with the Persian walnut has been acquired in the Roanoke\r\ndistrict of south-west Virginia. It is located 300 miles from the\r\nAtlantic seaboard and my trees are at an approximate elevation of eleven\r\nhundred feet. Roanoke is on the same parallel as Springfield, Missouri,\r\nand about thirty miles south of Rockport, Indiana.\r\n\r\nThis experience covers a period of more than twenty years with named\r\nvarieties and seedlings of the species. I shall here attempt to present\r\nsome findings that may be of some value to others similarly located.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of brevity I shall put the cart before the horse, the\r\nfindings before the facts from which they are derived.\r\n\r\nFor the upper south and, in my opinion, for the middle west, late\r\nvegetating and blossoming is of prime importance for success with the\r\nPersian walnut. No matter how vigorous, prolific and precocious the tree\r\nmay be, nor how fine the nuts, the variety is worthless for anything\r\nexcept shade if the crop is destroyed by normal spring frosts.\r\n\r\nIn the second place is winter hardiness. This is of two kinds;\r\nresistance to extreme cold, and resistance to the wooing of warm winter\r\ndays that starts premature activity, followed by a destructive freeze.\r\n\r\nMy experience with the Payne variety is a case in point. Having read\r\nsome place of the vigor, precocity and heavy bearing of the new variety,\r\nthen called the Payne Seedling, I secured some scions of it from its\r\noriginator and worked it on a young black walnut. The variety was\r\nalready making a name for itself in Northern California and Oregon, not\r\nonly because of its bearing habits but for the superb quality of its\r\nnuts.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few years it did well despite its early starting in the\r\nspring, and bore heavy crops; then disaster fell. One spring the tree\r\nfailed to leaf out at the usual time. On examination I found that it had\r\nwinter-killed back to five-year wood. The winter had been unusually\r\ncold, and the tree could not take it. Pruned back, the belated new\r\ngrowth did not fully mature before winter so in turn was damaged, a\r\nphenomenon that recurred from year to year. Exit Payne as a Virginia\r\nprospect.\r\n\r\nAn example of the other type of winter injury was that of my first Crath\r\nCarpathian. I secured scions of this variety from Rev. P. C. Crath in\r\n1929. The parent tree had been growing and bearing in the vicinity of\r\nToronto and was apparently fully hardy. The scions grew vigorously on\r\nthe young black walnut stock on which it was worked, and completed their\r\nlongitudinal growth early in July, giving ample time for the ripening of\r\nthe wood before winter.\r\n\r\nAfter several years I noticed the bark on the south side of the trunks\r\ndead from so-called sun-scald. Activity had been induced by the warmth\r\nof the winter sun, followed by freezing. After some years the wood was\r\nkilled back to limbs the thickness of one's wrist, and this has been\r\nagain repeated. The tree was hardy in Ontario, but not in Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe nut of this variety, which to me is the Crath, is much superior to\r\nthe average Carpathian, and I think might be well worth while in the\r\nnorth-east and along the Great Lakes, but not in the upper South nor the\r\nMid-West.\r\n\r\nBesides their winter weaknesses, both the Payne and Crath start too\r\nearly in the spring for my conditions.\r\n\r\nBroadview and Lancaster both blossom here in mid-season and, since both\r\nhave a rather long period of producing pistillate blossoms, they seldom\r\nfail to produce a crop when properly pollenized.\r\n\r\nFranquette and Mayette, both highly recommended as being late vegetating\r\nand producing excellent nuts, have offered me some difficulties of\r\nanother order. With Franquette the chief trouble has been to get a\r\nsuitable pollenizer. Like the Mayette, its pistillate blossoms appear\r\nten days or more after the staminate blossoms and self-pollination is\r\nnot effected. I tried King, recommended as a pollenizer, but it was too\r\nearly to be reliably effective. When Franquette is properly pollenized\r\nit, with Payne, is one of the heaviest bearers.\r\n\r\nMayette in Virginia produces a fine, healthy, vigorous tree, but it\r\nrefuses to produce pistillate blossoms. A dozen nuts is an average crop\r\nfor a tree that should produce a bushel. It, like Franquette, demands a\r\nlate pollenizer, but the pistillate blossoms are simply not there.\r\nNeither of these two late varieties have ever suffered winter injury\r\nwith me, nor have been damaged by spring frosts.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to go into detail regarding all the varieties and\r\nseedlings that I have tried through the years; Eureka, that ranks with\r\nMayette and Franquette for lateness, but refuses to bear, apparently for\r\nwant of pollination; Chambers that was recommended along with King for\r\npollenizing the late bloomers but not fully successful; Breslau, with\r\nits huge nuts but slow growth, in addition to an assortment of\r\nCarpathian seedlings. Of the latter my Caesar is one of the more\r\npromising with its vigorous growth, large thin-shelled nuts and ability\r\nto pollenize itself in some seasons. Gilbert Becker has reported it\r\npassing through Michigan winters unhurt.\r\n\r\nAs matters now stand, I believe Bedford, Caesar and Lancaster have\r\nproven the most satisfactory varieties to date under my conditions,\r\nalthough some seedlings I have grown appear even more promising. Chief\r\nof these are several that I grew from open-pollenized nuts of the\r\nLancaster, which I am here exhibiting.\r\n\r\nYou will note that the one I designate as L-2 is an extremely large nut,\r\nconsiderably larger than its seed parent which it somewhat resembles.\r\nL-8 is of somewhat similar type, but smaller. L-3 and L-6, on the other\r\nhand, are of entirely different type. Much smaller, they are smooth,\r\nthin-shelled and well filled, with kernels running 50% by weight and of\r\nhigh quality. They resemble their seed parent, Lancaster, not at all but\r\nin type are much nearer Bedford, their probable pollen parent.\r\n\r\nAnother one of these seedlings, L-7, resembles Caesar, its probable\r\npollen parent, far more than it does its seed parent.\r\n\r\nSome years ago I hand-pollenized several blossoms of Broadview, using\r\npollen from my original Crath.\r\n\r\nOne of the seedlings from these hand-pollenized nuts resembles Crath\r\nmuch more than Broadview, the seed parent. I have it here as C x B 2.\r\n\r\nAside from the apparent profound influence of the pollen parent on the\r\noffspring, there is the unexplained fact at that with the exception of\r\nL-8, all these seedlings are later vegetating than the seed parents and\r\nany of the suspect pollen parents. Of the Lancaster seedlings L-2, L-3\r\nand L-6 are fully as late as Franquette and Mayette, blooming well after\r\nthe first of May. Inasmuch as there were no Persians producing pollen\r\nanywhere near that time I can only believe that these nuts were\r\npollenized by the black walnut on which they were top-worked. I intend\r\nto plant some of these nuts, and expect to produce hybrids.\r\n\r\nThis brings up the enticing subject of breeding Persian walnuts adapted\r\nto one's own conditions. I have no suggestions to offer scientists, but\r\noffer the following for the benefit of amateurs like myself.\r\n\r\nIf your grounds are cluttered up with varieties, as are mine, ingratiate\r\nyourself to some friend who has an isolated young black walnut tree by\r\nvolunteering to convert it to the production of Persian walnuts. Select\r\ntwo varieties whose characteristics you desire to blend and that will\r\npollenize each other, and grow seedlings from the resulting nuts. You\r\ncan check results in as little as four years by taking buds from the\r\nseedlings at two years and placing then on black walnut.\r\n\r\nCreative work, this. You will get the thrill of your life--if you are\r\nthat kind of a person--and may produce something well worth while.\r\n\r\nPersian walnuts are self-pollenizing if pistillate and staminate\r\nblossoms occur at the same time, but such usually is not the case.\r\nCrath, Breslau, Caesar and King produce their pistillate blossoms some\r\ndays before their staminate blossoms shed their pollen, while Payne,\r\nLancaster, Broadview, Franquette and Mayette produce their blossoms in\r\nreverse order. Of all those I have tested only Bedford can be depended\r\nto produce both types of bloom simultaneously and certainly and fully\r\npollenize itself.\r\n\r\nIt is enlightening to keep a record of the blossoming time of each\r\nvariety relative to others, but dates should all be recorded for the\r\nsame year. Warm, early spring induces early blooming; late, cool weather\r\ndelays blossoming. By my records, Payne pistillates were receptive May 3\r\nin 1935, April 28 in 1937 and March 31, in 1945, a variation of over a\r\nmonth. All varieties vary with the season, but the variation is greatest\r\nwith the early varieties.\r\n\r\nThere has been little disease among my Persian walnuts except that in\r\nwet seasons leaves and nut shucks are sometimes attacked by a fungous\r\nblight. In the city there has been no insect injury worthy of note. In\r\nthe country, adjacent to wooded areas, insect injury is sometimes\r\nserious. Pests include spittle bugs, stink bugs and other insects that\r\nattack young leaves and tender growth. These check the leaders and\r\ncause late multiple growths that may fail to mature and hence\r\nwinterkill.\r\n\r\nIn such locations the butternut curculio also attacks and destroys the\r\nyoung nuts. Avoid wooded areas if choosing a site for a Persian walnut\r\norchard.\r\n\r\nThe most destructive pest with which I have had to contend has been the\r\nlarge black-bird or purple grackle. Oddly enough they are much worse in\r\nthe city than in the country. As soon as the young are grown, about the\r\nmiddle of June, they appear in flocks and attack the nuts of the Persian\r\nwalnut. At first, before the shell has hardened, they penetrate the nut\r\napparently for the nectar which is the substance of the immature kernel.\r\nWhen the shell can no longer be penetrated they continue to eat away the\r\nhusk, which is equally fatal to the nut. This continues until late in\r\nJuly, when the squirrels take over. Fortunately squirrels are highly\r\nallergic to a bullet from a 22 rifle.\r\n\r\nIn pointing out some of the hazards encountered in growing Persian\r\nwalnuts in the East the writer has not intended to be discouraging but\r\nhelpful. Persian walnuts of good quality can be grown in this section;\r\nfull understanding of the factors involved make it possible, I believe,\r\nto grow them successfully on a commercial scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVarieties of Persian Walnuts in Eastern Iowa\r\n\r\nIra B. Kyhl, _Sabula, Iowa_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a great many varieties of Persian walnuts, many of which\r\noriginated in the region of the Carpathian mountains and other parts of\r\nEurope and a few varieties in the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nI believe that some varieties now grown in the United States and Canada\r\nwhich originated in Europe may have come from the same tree as they\r\nappear to have the same shape, thickness of shell and flavor. I have as\r\nmany as four varieties that are identical.\r\n\r\nThe Persian walnut has always been my favorite nut. I started with 2 or\r\n3 varieties and now have 35 or 40 varieties and 200 trees most of which\r\nare doing well. Some are superior in hardiness and vigor.\r\n\r\nIn eastern Iowa at 42 degrees N. latitude minimum winter temperatures\r\nvary from 25 to 32 degrees below zero. Usually the minimum is 12 to 15\r\ndegrees below zero, but last winter it was 25 degrees below zero for\r\nseveral days. Only the hardier varieties will endure -25 degrees without\r\ninjury, but -12 to -15 does not injure any variety very much.\r\n\r\nSchafer is my favorite variety and it was not injured at -25 degrees. I\r\nhave several of these trees, some from seeds, some top-worked on black\r\nwalnut and the others grafted trees from a nursery. It grafts easily,\r\ngrows rapidly and bears a fine nut.\r\n\r\nA top-worked tree of Colby withstood -25 degrees without injury and is\r\none of the most vigorous trees I have.\r\n\r\nFifteen seedlings from Crath Mayette and Crath Franquette seeds from the\r\nlate G. H. Corsan, of Toronto, Canada, are developing into very fine\r\ntrees, but are not yet bearing.\r\n\r\nOne of the first varieties planted, Broadview, grew rapidly and\r\nproduced nuts after two mild winters, but the several trees of this\r\nvariety killed to the ground after the -25 degrees of last winter.\r\n\r\nCrath No. 1, Crath No. 39, and Breslau grew well until last winter when\r\nthey were killed. Three Breslau seedlings did not winterkill.\r\n\r\nRumanian Giant, the first tree I grafted, killed back somewhat, but is\r\nrecovering. This variety produces the largest nut I have seen and it\r\nfills well.\r\n\r\nTop-worked trees of other varieties that were not injured last winter\r\nare Crath No. 5, Crath No. 12, SG No. 5, Crath No. 29, Graham and Crath\r\nSpecial.\r\n\r\nSeedlings in the nursery row that stood severe temperature are\r\nCarpathian D, NWF Nos. 1 and 3, FB O and FB OO, Fort Custer, Hansen,\r\nJacobs and others.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: Does the black walnut bloom at the same time that the Persian\r\nwalnut blooms?\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: It bloomed near the end of the receptive period.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: That first experiment of yours was trying to pollinize the\r\nblack walnut with the Persian, but the reciprocal cross may be quite\r\ndifferent, as Jones proved with the filberts.\r\n\r\nDR. McKAY: That could be. We have no large amount of data on the\r\nreciprocal cross. These cases where it is said that the black walnut\r\npollinates the Persian regularly and is producing good crops of nuts, I\r\nwould consider doubtful until I see the seedlings, their growth and\r\ncharacteristics. Yesterday Mr. Bolten asked the question whether or not\r\nsome walnuts that have large nuts could possibly be tetraploid or\r\npolyploid. A number of years ago I examined the chromosomes of one of\r\nthese large fruited varieties, and it had the same chromosome number as\r\nthe others, namely sixteen pairs or thirty two.\r\n\r\nThe whole question of chromosome number in nut varieties and species is\r\nas follows. So far as we know, all of the species have a constant number\r\nwithin the genus except the hickories where we have tetraploid species\r\nand diploid species. All of the species of _Castanea_, as far as we\r\nknow, have the same chromosome number, and all of the varieties within\r\neach species have the same number. In the Oaks, which are related to\r\nchestnuts, we have an extremely large genus in which there is a great\r\nconstancy of number. The pines, and all other cone-bearing trees make up\r\nanother very large group in which chromosome numbers are constant.\r\nExactly the opposite situation is found in the related family of alders\r\nand willows where the chromosome number is very variable.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: Unless there is some special question or comment\r\non this subject, we will go on to the next item.\r\n\r\nMR. LEMKE: There was a panel discussion about four years ago, and they\r\nwere talking about what nuts to grow, and one of the men said, \"Before\r\nyou offer a man a good nut, give him a good nut cracker.\" That's been on\r\nmy mind for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommercial Production and Processing of Black and Persian Walnuts\r\n\r\nEDWIN W. LEMKE, _Washington, Mich._\r\n\r\n\r\nSometime ago a group of nut minded men associated with Spencer B. Chase\r\nannounced their findings on the quality of the wild black walnut growing\r\nin the area of Norris, Tenn. Nuts were gathered from 151 wild walnut\r\ntrees. After judging, the group came to the conclusion that only one\r\ntree had a flavor that was considered by their standards as good. It is\r\nthese good nuts that caused the formation of the N.N.G.A. When we speak\r\nof the good nut it gives the word commercial an entirely different\r\nmeaning. It by necessity excludes most of wild black walnut kernels\r\nprocessed by the large cracking plants of Kentucky and Tennessee. The\r\nlarge crackers are willing to pay better prices for the improved black\r\nwalnut but were they to rely on this source of supply they could not\r\nstay in business very long.\r\n\r\nTo produce and process, I chose the Thomas and Ohio variety and I have\r\nmet with some success. The black walnut can be made to bear in the first\r\nand second year after grafting but this is but a novelty feature. Jones\r\nfrom whom I purchased my trees, told me that the black walnut could be\r\nclassed with the Northern Spy Apple for coming into bearing. This has\r\nproven true. Commercial production of the improved black walnut is by\r\nits very nature small scale production. Because of this fact only small\r\nscale machines to process these nuts are feasible.\r\n\r\nSince 1916 I have had time to reflect on the problem of the three basic\r\nmachines needed. These are the huller, cracker and kernel picker.\r\nFortunately for me I learned the machinist trade and had a machine shop\r\nat my disposal. I tried every way to hull the black walnut and finally\r\naccepted the commercial potato peeler as the best principle. I built\r\nseveral crackers and at last accepted the Wiley cracker as the best\r\ncommercial cracker. The third machine is the picker which has yet to be\r\nassembled. This picker is copied after The Kenneth Dick machine with\r\nsome variations in the separation process.\r\n\r\nLet me briefly explain these three basic machines. As the nuts are\r\ngathered in the orchard they are brought to the huller in bushel crates.\r\nThe huller is located in a separate room. This room has the floor\r\ndepressed to catch the removed hulls that are flushed outdoors with the\r\naid of running water. The cylinder of this huller is 30 inches in\r\ndiameter and 14 inches high. It is made of 3/16ths boiler plate. Three\r\ninches from the bottom of the cylinder is a revolving disc smaller than\r\nthe inside of the cylinder. The disc being small enough it allows a\r\n5/8th opening around the inside of the cylinder. It is this opening that\r\npermits the hulls to drop to the floor. The nuts are held captive\r\nbecause there is no opening in the cylinder for them to leave until the\r\ndischarge door is opened on the side of the cylinder. The cover of the\r\ncylinder has a 10 inch feed hole into which the nuts are fed. A 10 inch\r\nfurnace pipe elbow runs from the hole to the serving trough into which\r\nthe nuts are poured. A 10 inch pusher is used to shove the nuts into the\r\nhuller and serves to keep the feed hole closed while the nuts tumble\r\naround. The disc runs at 250 RPM which is the proper speed to do a good\r\njob. While the nuts tumble around a stream of water is used to wash the\r\nhulls free from the nuts and force the removed hulls to the floor below.\r\nThe disc is supported by a 1-3/8 inch diameter shaft that runs through\r\nthe disc and is held central as it revolves in a flange containing a 3/4\r\nball bearing that fits into the end of the concave in the shaft. Up four\r\nfeet from the disc is a link self aligning bearing that allows the shaft\r\nand disc to turn like a gyroscopic top. The shaft's pulley has 'V' belts\r\nconnected to a 3/4 h.p. motor. I have hulled up to 40 bushels of clean\r\nnuts in 8 hours. The nuts after hulling are placed on drying trays\r\nindoors where temperatures are better controlled. The principal of this\r\nhuller is that it separates the hull by centrifugal force. The hull\r\ndrops down through the opening between cylinder and disc while the nuts\r\nriding on disc are discharged at right angles to the fall of hull. The\r\nmachine is a separator.\r\n\r\nThe next basic machine is the cracker. This cracker is the Wylie cracker\r\nin principle and is made in Eugene, Oregon. Simply explained it could be\r\nlikened to two pages in a book. One page is perpendicular while the\r\nother page is off the perpendicular about 7 degrees. The first page\r\nwhich is the anvil is fixed save for adjustments for nuts of varying\r\nsize. The other page or hammer riding up and down through an inch and\r\none quarter of travel is fixed to a crank below. Both of these pages or\r\nplates are heavy cast iron plates that are fluted and cause the nut to\r\nbe cracked against these saw toothed flutes and while being cracked are\r\nrevolved down through the plates. The plate moving at an angle forces\r\nthe nut finally through a 3/8 inch opening where they fall into a rotary\r\nsieve. The sieve has three sizes of mesh. 5 mesh, 2 mesh and 3/4 mesh.\r\nThe larger pieces go on through and are returned to the cracker. This\r\ncracker will crack up to 500 pounds per hour, and uses a 3/4 h.p. motor.\r\n\r\nThe last of the three basic machines is the picker. I have not yet built\r\nthe picker but a number of the parts have already been machined and\r\nbefore long it will be a reality. The Kenneth Dick, picker, of Peebles,\r\nOhio is the best for small orchards. It is essentially a separator using\r\na conveyor belt which carries the cracked nuts to needles that pick up\r\nthe kernels and deposit them on trays that at the timed moment accept\r\nthe black walnut kernels. The discarded shells remain on conveyor and\r\ntravel to the end and fall into a receptacle. After this process,\r\nfurther inspection becomes necessary but up to the present it is the\r\nbest we have.\r\n\r\nThe black walnut is a messy nut to fool with but with the proper\r\nmachines it soon becomes a pleasure to work with it. I can work all day\r\nhulling nuts and finish with clean unstained hands.\r\n\r\nProcessing the Persian walnut is a simple matter as compared with the\r\nblack walnut. My Persian nuts are gathered and placed on drying trays.\r\nMost of the nuts fall free from hull and the stick tights are discarded\r\nas inferior. N.N.G.A. members need but write to the agricultural\r\ncolleges in California, Oregon and Washington and a list of publications\r\nwill be sent. One of the latest machines being offered is one that picks\r\nthe nut from the orchard floor with a speed with which no human can\r\ncompete. It has not only removed the back ache but the human back as\r\nwell. The Persian walnut industry in the Pacific Coast states is big\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThere is only one organization that can and does disseminate the\r\nnecessary knowledge and experience that will give the northern grown nut\r\nits proper place in the American diet. That is the Northern Nut Grower's\r\nAssn. You newer members have become heirs to knowledge based on the\r\nexperiences of others which represents not only blood, sweat and tears\r\nbut a lot of good hearty belly laughs. When one becomes nut conscious\r\nthere is no turning back. It gives life a new approach and a finer\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlack Walnut Processing at Henderson, Kentucky\r\n\r\nR. C. MANGELSDORF, _St. Louis, Mo._\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: Mr. Walker and Mr. McDonald are unable to be here\r\ntoday, and I don't know if I can fill their shoes or not, because I am\r\nnot in the purchasing or processing end of the black walnut business.\r\n\r\nWe started this black walnut shelling operation a season ago at\r\nHenderson, Kentucky, with the idea of processing the nuts there and\r\ntransporting the kernels to St. Louis for final processing and\r\nmarketing. At Henderson, Kentucky we are located outside the city limit,\r\nand we have no fire protection, and as a result, the insurance rates on\r\nour building, storage sheds, and black walnuts in storage have been so\r\nhigh that we are looking around for possible plant location sites where\r\nwe can reduce that expense of operation.\r\n\r\nAnother factor in our operation there is the transportation of raw\r\nmaterial to our cracking site. If we have to transport black walnuts,\r\nwhich give an approximate 10 per cent yield, any distance, the freight\r\nadds materially to the cost per pound of the finished material. That is,\r\nif we have to pay 10 cents per hundred additional freight cost in\r\ntransporting them from outlying districts to the cracking plant, that\r\nadds a cent a pound to the cost of the finished kernels. All such\r\nfactors, have to be given weighty consideration, because our business is\r\nprimarily concerned with making money for the stockholders. If we don't\r\nmake money for the stockholders, they are not interested in seeing us\r\ncontinue the operation.\r\n\r\nMr. Walker and Mr. McDonald at the present time are out on a crop\r\ninspection trip and also making surveys of locations and availability of\r\nbuildings or sites that might be more advantageous than the one at\r\nHenderson, Kentucky. It may be that we will continue the operation\r\nthere, making modifications in the building, which will result in lower\r\ninsurance rates. At the present time, with the new crop coming on, we\r\nare in a chaotic state of affairs, because we just don't know exactly\r\nwhat's the best path to follow in our operation at Henderson, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nAre there any questions?\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: Will you tell us something about how you handle the nuts in\r\nyour plant, how they are hulled and cracked, and so forth?\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: It's a similar operation to what Mr. Lemke described.\r\nThe nuts are brought in in burlap bags by the farmers and growers and\r\nare put in storage in cribs. The plant at Henderson, Kentucky, was a\r\npopcorn processing plant, with a large crib under roof where the nuts\r\nare stored. After the moisture content is reduced somewhat, they pass\r\nthrough a tumbling drum to remove any of the extraneous hulls and other\r\ndirt that might be adhering.\r\n\r\nAfter the nuts are completely freed of all this extraneous matter, they\r\nare passed through a series of cracking rollers with screens. The nuts\r\nare cracked, by passing between two rollers like a wringer then passed\r\nover a shaker screen, the free nut meats passing through the screen. The\r\nlarge material that comes off of the screen is then passed between more\r\nclosely spaced cracking rollers and then further sifted and screened.\r\nThen the various materials that have passed through the screens are run\r\nthrough a Smalley picker. This is nothing more than metal pins on a\r\nseries of fingers rotating on a roller that presses against a sponge\r\nrubber roller. The nut meats adhere to the prongs or points. The shells,\r\nnot being penetrated by the points of the pins, are not picked up. Then\r\nthere is a comb that picks off the adhering kernels from the picker\r\nprongs. That's the principle of most of the shelling operations of the\r\nblack walnuts. I don't believe any major changes have been made in the\r\nprocessing of black walnuts in the last ten years.\r\n\r\nDR. COLBY: How do you remove the hulls?\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: We try to buy only hulled walnuts, the farmer and the\r\ngrower removing the hulls in a tumbler and selling to us only the\r\ndehulled walnuts.\r\n\r\nThe kernels are packed in cartons and shipped to St. Louis for final\r\npicking of remaining shells and off-colored nut meats and graded for\r\ncolor, size and quality. After this grading separation is made, they are\r\neither packed in our 4-ounce vacuum-packed tins or 30-pound bulk cartons\r\nwhich are then sold through the trade.\r\n\r\nMR. WALLICK: What percentage of kernels do you get?\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: I think our operation at Henderson, Kentucky this past\r\nseason for all of the nuts that were grown and gathered in this locality\r\nwas about 9.48 per cent yield of black walnut kernels by weight.\r\n\r\nMR. WHITFORD: Do you get any improved varieties, such as Thomas, Stabler\r\nor Ohio?\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: No. With most of the nuts that we gather in our\r\nmarketing operation very little attention is paid to variety or source.\r\nWe don't try to differentiate and store them separately, but everything\r\nis processed as it is brought together.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: Do you have any indication that you get a better quality\r\nnut from one county or one area than you do from another?\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: That is a question that I can't answer, because I am in\r\nthe research and development end of the business, and have very little\r\nto do with the purchasing and marketing of the nuts themselves.\r\n\r\nMR. LEMKE: What do you do when you strike a day that is very humid and\r\nthe nuts start getting moldy?\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: That is a bugaboo. I always say you don't have to be\r\nnuts to be in the nut business, but it sure helps a little bit. All the\r\nnuts that I have ever had any dealing with seem to be very susceptible\r\nto mold growth. If the moisture content of the nuts is above a critical\r\nlevel, mold growth takes place in the shell at a very fast rate. The\r\nonly thing we can do in a case like that is to get the kernels in to St.\r\nLouis and destroy the mold growth or spores on the surface before it can\r\ngrow so that the fungous mycelium is visible to the eye. The black\r\nwalnut and pecan, if you examine them under the microscope, all seem to\r\nhave mold growth on the surface of the kernels. I am inclined to believe\r\nthat the nut kernel is not completely sterile in the shell and that\r\nthrough some manner or means the mold spores have been introduced onto\r\nthe kernel, because immediately after shelling examination of these nuts\r\nunder a microscope, will show some fungous mycelium on the surface of\r\nthe kernels.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: One comment is that the pellicle of a black walnut or a\r\npecan, is very hygroscopic. It tends to absorb moisture readily, whereas\r\nthe kernel itself, being high in oil, does not take up water readily.\r\nThat, apparently, is why there may be evidences of mold growth on the\r\nkernel though it may not be actually penetrating. It is only\r\nsuperficial, growing on the pellicle of the kernel, not on the kernel\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: Right.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: Black walnut kernels are outstanding in their resistance to\r\nheat and will get rancid very slowly under conditions of high heat--not\r\nhumidity. For example, we had some nuts in our attic for two summers in\r\na place where it gets very hot, yet dry. Those nuts are in very good\r\neating condition today. I don't know about pecans.\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: That's very true of black walnuts. Pecans have to be\r\ncarried throughout the season in our cracking operations under\r\nrefrigeration, but the black walnuts we can store out in any shed with\r\ntin roof. The temperature gets very hot, and it seems to have no effect\r\nwhatever on the edibility or rancidity of the nut kernel.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: You spoke of storing the whole nuts in large bins. There you\r\nmay have an extreme amount of mold, too, if the nuts are damp.\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: We try to have storage conditions such that air has\r\nfree passage through the bulk of nuts. The mold and the yeast are there\r\nand when they start to grow, their metabolism throws off quite a large\r\namount of heat. As a result the molding process is speeded up like a\r\nchain reaction, and before long the nuts will be worthless for shelling.\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: We had nuts until just a few weeks ago from our last\r\nseason's gatherings. That's almost a whole year.\r\n\r\nMR. SALZER: Can you tell me if the farmer is paid by the weight of the\r\nnuts, or does he receive his pay after the kernels are shelled out? Does\r\nhe receive more money if it contains a higher percent of kernels?\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: He receives his pay on the basis of the whole nut that\r\nhe delivers to the plant, and we try to exercise some control over the\r\nquality of the delivery. Samples are taken and cracked, and if most of\r\nthe nuts are rotten or the quality is very low, we may reject buying\r\nthat entire lot, or we may discount the lot of nuts a certain amount,\r\ndepending upon the percentage of the nut meats that are salvaged.\r\n\r\nMR. MURPHY: Do you pay a premium for cultivated nuts?\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: That I can't answer, but I don't believe that they\r\nhave this past season. I wouldn't want to go on record as to that. There\r\nis a tremendous difference in the flavor of what we call the \"eastern\"\r\nblack walnut in comparison with the California or western black walnut.\r\nWe think that the flavor of the California walnut is not at all\r\ncomparable to the eastern black walnut.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: You don't notice any difference, do you, between the\r\nMissouri and the Kentucky nuts?\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: No, not in my experience, but there is a tremendous\r\ndifference in flavor between the eastern and western.\r\n\r\nMR. ROHRBACHER: On what basis do you buy black walnuts?\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: I understand that each individual sale is an individual\r\n\"horse-trading\" deal, the price paid, depending upon the quality of\r\nnuts, moisture content, color and other factors. Of course, our aim is\r\nto buy the nuts as cheaply as possible and the object of the fellow\r\nselling the nuts is to get the greatest return that he can from what he\r\nhas to offer. So we try to reach a happy medium in our dealings, and a\r\nlot of concessions might be made one way or the other with special lots\r\nthat are offered for sale.\r\n\r\nMR. WHITFORD: What sizes and grades of kernels do you have?\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: We have the large, medium, small and granules. Granules\r\nare very small pieces. Usually the prices paid for the nuts are not\r\ndetermined, actually, until the crop starts to move. Everybody has an\r\nidea what the market price will be for the nuts, but nothing is\r\ncrystallized or brought to a focus until the first nuts are actually on\r\nthe market. Then the nuts sold are examined as to quality, giving some\r\nidea of the future quality of deliveries that might be made in that\r\nsection, and then prices can be established. As I say, it's a nutty\r\nbusiness. I haven't grown very many gray hairs yet, but I expect to have\r\nmany before I am through. And each new problem that arises in this nut\r\nbusiness, when you reach a solution for it, invariably there are two\r\nother problems that are created, and if you are not wide awake, one of\r\nthese problems can be much greater than the one that you just had a\r\nsolution for.\r\n\r\nMR. DAVIDSON: Do you know anything as to the bearing of black walnuts\r\nthis year as compared to previous years?\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: Mr. Walker and Mr. McDonald are out at the present time\r\nmaking a crop inspection tour of the various localities, and I have had\r\nno report as to what the condition of the crop will be this year.\r\n\r\nMR. WHITFORD: Which grades bring the highest prices?\r\n\r\nMR. MANGELSDORF: The large particles of kernel demand a premium over the\r\nsmaller sizes. That is one of the discrepancies in the shelling\r\noperation, that the material that costs us the least money to produce\r\ngives the largest returns. When you have small pieces, the operation of\r\nremoving the last remaining shells and off-colored particles is much\r\ngreater than with the large kernels. One large kernel amounts to\r\nconsiderable weight and you may have to pick up many small particles to\r\nrepresent the same weight.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: We appreciate very much your talk, Mr.\r\nMangelsdorf.\r\n\r\nOne thing that interested me was your statement that having large\r\npieces was an advantage. That question has been argued on the floor of\r\nthese conventions a number of times and there have been those who\r\nclaimed that the larger pieces were all ground up anyway and that the\r\nvarieties from which you can recover large pieces were of no particular\r\nmerit commercially.\r\n\r\nThe next paper is, \"Nut Shells--Asset or Liability?\", T. S. Clark of the\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture, Regional Laboratory, Peoria,\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNut Shells--Assets or Liabilities\r\n\r\nT. S. CLARK, _Northern Regional Research Laboratory_,[1] _Peoria,\r\nIllinois_\r\n\r\n\r\nABSTRACT. The value of nut shells as materials for agricultural and\r\nindustrial use is discussed. Problems of plant location, shell\r\ncollection, processing, and hazards are considered. Applications and\r\nspecifications are illustrated.\r\n\r\nWe are particularly pleased that the Northern Nut Growers Association is\r\npresenting this opportunity for a discussion of nut shell utilization.\r\nThe Northern Regional Research Laboratory feels that it has played an\r\nimportant role in what is now becoming a new industry of increasing\r\nmagnitude. For the benefit of those who are not already acquainted with\r\nthe Laboratory, permit me to digress momentarily to explain briefly its\r\norganization and functions.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Regional Laboratory at Peoria, Illinois, is one of four\r\nlarge research laboratories established by an act of Congress in 1938\r\nand placed under the administration of the Bureau of Agricultural and\r\nIndustrial Chemistry. The function of these laboratories is to conduct\r\nresearch and to develop new chemical and technical uses as well as new\r\nand expanded markets for the farm commodities and byproducts of the\r\nregions in which the laboratories are located. The commodities studied\r\nat the Northern Regional Research Laboratory are the oilseeds, cereal\r\ngrains and agricultural residues which include corncobs, stalks, straws,\r\nsugar cane bagasse, hulls and shells of nuts and fruit pits. Because of\r\nthe great similarity in chemical and physical characteristics of the\r\nresidues all research on these materials is conducted at the Northern\r\nLaboratory.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that the Northern Laboratory has been actively\r\ninvestigating shell materials and other agricultural residues we have\r\nbeen in direct communication with operators of shell grinding plants;\r\nsome of these have been visited. We have received numerous letters and\r\ncalls for information and assistance in solving grinding problems, or in\r\nusing the ground products. Through these contacts and our experiences we\r\nhave learned much about the factors that lead to success or failure in\r\nthis utilization. Ten plants are now producing a variety of ground shell\r\nproducts useful in both agriculture and industry.\r\n\r\nWhen the Northern Laboratory was organized, only one plant, established\r\noriginally by the California Walnut Growers Association, was grinding\r\nnut shells. This plant, following a number of operational difficulties\r\nand administrative changes, now processes 40 tons or more of shells per\r\nday and produces a wide variety of ground products including exceedingly\r\nfine flours for use in plastics and plywood adhesives. It has been said\r\nthat this plant processes all of the English walnut and apricot pit\r\nshells and 80 percent of the peach pit shells available in California.\r\n\r\nThe Laboratory has attempted to determine the amount of shells and pits\r\navailable commercially in different areas. Data of this nature has been\r\nobtained for the larger cracking plants but there are many small\r\noperations for which we lack this information. \"Agricultural Statistics\"\r\ncompiled and published annually by the U. S. Department of Agriculture\r\nprovide an excellent source of information regarding production and, in\r\nmany cases, the disposition of farm commodities. For example, the\r\nproduction of pecans in 1951, presented by states, totaled more than\r\n73,000 tons for the 10 states reported. However, no data were available\r\nregarding marketings in-shell, or the quantities remaining on the farms\r\nor in the orchards. Thus, the quantity of pecan shells actually\r\navailable for processing can be determined only through surveys of\r\ncracking plants. Only limited information is available concerning black\r\nwalnut shells and this has been obtained through the cooperation of\r\nshellers or crackers.\r\n\r\nIn some areas fruit pits, such as apricot and peach pits, accumulate at\r\ncanneries or freezing plants. Similarity in character of the pit shells\r\nto those of the nuts permits their use in plants grinding nut shells.\r\nThus, the supply of raw material in any area may be augmented by\r\ninclusion of fruit pit shells.\r\n\r\nCollection of nut shells for grinding operations is a relatively simple\r\nprocedure, particularly where grinding is done at a cracking plant.\r\nWhere shells must be collected over large areas both rail and truck\r\ntransportation are used. If fruit pits are considered, provisions should\r\nbe made for removal of residual flesh or pulp before the pits leave the\r\ncanneries. In the cases where the pits have been cut during processing\r\nof the fruits, the released kernels should be removed before shipping\r\nthe shells. Pit kernels are valuable for their oil content.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell Use During World War II\r\n\r\nThe production and maintenance schedules set up during World War II\r\nresulted in the development and expansion of uses for ground shell\r\nmaterials. Fine flours from walnut shells were needed as extenders in\r\nplywood adhesives. Soft grits from various shells were used by the Army\r\nAir Forces in the air-blast method for cleaning airplane engines and\r\nparts. Grits were required for deburring metal stampings and\r\nflash-removal from molded plastics. These uses have expanded\r\nconsiderably to meet civilian needs since the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrinding Nut Shells and Fruit Pits\r\n\r\nAs uses for ground shell products were developed the Laboratory sought\r\nadvice of grinding equipment manufacturers for information on the design\r\nand construction of suitable grinding plants. Only limited tests had\r\nbeen made and data were not readily available in any published form.\r\nConsequently the Laboratory undertook an extensive study on grinding nut\r\nshells and fruit pits as part of its research on agricultural residues.\r\n\r\nThese studies were not limited to grinding only, but included methods of\r\nseparation and classification based on physical characteristics of the\r\nraw materials; the relation of associated mechanical operations; a\r\nconsideration of the hazards; the problems of labor, management, and\r\nmerchandising.\r\n\r\nA number of fires have occurred in plants grinding nut shells, corncobs,\r\nstock feeds, and similar materials. In most cases the causes of fire\r\nhave been other than the grinding operation. From a consideration of the\r\ncauses of fires a number of safety precautions have been developed. Good\r\nplant housekeeping is paramount. This is essential, not only because of\r\ninfluence of dust and dirt on the maintenance of motors and equipment,\r\nbut because of the highly explosive nature of shell dusts. The U. S.\r\nBureau of Mines has cooperated closely with the Northern Laboratory in\r\nevaluating the explosive hazards of the shell dusts.\r\n\r\nMany of the present operators of shelling-grinding plants have benefited\r\nfrom the information and assistance available from this Laboratory. The\r\ncooperation of equipment manufacturers has aided considerably in\r\nextending the scope of the Laboratory's studies.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Laboratory has published bulletin AIC-336, \"Dry Grinding\r\nAgricultural Residues, A New Industrial Enterprise\" that summarizes the\r\nresearch conducted to date. This is the first time that such data on\r\nengineering and design has been assembled and published to cover this\r\nfield. Copies of the bulletin may be obtained by addressing requests to\r\nthe Northern Regional Research Laboratory, Peoria, Illinois.\r\n\r\nPlants designed to produce at least 1-1/2 tons per hour of ground shell\r\nproducts will cost upwards of $60,000. A well-engineered plant of such\r\nsize will require three to five men per shift. Among other factors, the\r\nworking capacity of a grinding plant depends upon the quantity of shells\r\navailable and the ability of the organization to merchandize its\r\nproducts. The plant should be located in an area in which at least 5,000\r\ntons of nut shells or fruit pits are annually available at low\r\ntransportation costs.\r\n\r\n\r\nUses of Shell Products\r\n\r\nThe more important uses for nut shell products, together with their\r\nspecifications for particle size, are shown in Table 1.\r\n\r\n   Table 1.--Uses for ground nut shells and fruit pits\r\n\r\n +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+\r\n | Applications                                   | Size               |\r\n |                                                |                    |\r\n | Deburring, cleaning, burnishing and polishing  |                    |\r\n |    in metal stamping, electroplating and       | No. 10 to No. 50   |\r\n |     plastics industries                        |                    |\r\n | Soft-grit blasting                             | No. 10 to No. 30   |\r\n | Fillers for plastics and plywood adhesives     | Finer than No. 100 |\r\n | Insecticide diluents and carriers              | Finer than No. 140 |\r\n | Explosives                                     | No. 10 to No. 100  |\r\n | Fur cleaning                                   | No. 10 to No. 100  |\r\n | Poultry litter and mulch (almond and peanut)   | 1/4 to 3/4 inch    |\r\n | Fillers for fertilizers (almond and peanut)    | Finer than No. 20  |\r\n +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+\r\n\r\nExperience shows that no matter how nut shells or fruit pit shells are\r\nground both under- and oversize particles will be produced. The hard,\r\nfriable character of most of the nut shells makes their reduction to\r\nfine size particles less difficult than for tough materials, such as\r\ncorncobs, or fibrous materials such as woods. Shells from almonds\r\nbecause of their bulk and very fibrous nature are somewhat less\r\nconvenient to handle than other shells. Good business practice shows\r\nthat sales outlets should be found for each fraction so that grinding\r\nexpenses can be kept at a minimum.\r\n\r\nBecause there are some differences in physical characteristics of nut\r\nshells and fruit pits all shell products do not necessarily meet the\r\nsame specifications, nor have the same uses.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndustrial Cleaning and Finishing\r\n\r\nOil, dirt, corrosion products, stain, paint, grease and the like can be\r\nremoved from metal surfaces by air-blasting with soft grits prepared\r\nfrom shells of walnuts, pecans, peach pits, and similar residues. This\r\nmethod was developed originally for the Navy to use grits from\r\ncorn-cobs for cleaning aircraft engines and parts. The method is\r\ninexpensive and foolproof because surfaces are cleaned without change of\r\ndimensions. No pitting or abrasion, such as produced by sand blasting,\r\noccurs. The method is particularly useful with mild steel, nonferrous\r\nmetals, alloys, and parts that must be maintained at close tolerances.\r\nModifications of the blast method are used in finishing molded plastics,\r\nmetal die-castings, and machined parts. One manufacturer of precision\r\ninstruments states that his company saves $100,000 a year in finishing\r\nparts with shell grits.\r\n\r\nMany stamped metal articles and molded plastics are deburred, cleaned,\r\nburnished, and polished by tumbling in drums containing shell grits.\r\nVarious grades of grits are required depending upon the nature of the\r\npieces being finished.\r\n\r\n\r\nFillers for Plastics and Plywood Glues\r\n\r\nThe Laboratory has studied the use of shell flours for use in plastics\r\nand plywood glues. Many of these flours are now in regular commercial\r\nuse. Flours for these applications are prepared in various grades, all\r\nfiner than 100-mesh. Use of these flours not only improves the\r\nproperties of the final products but also reduces the cost of the\r\nproducts. Molded plastics prepared with fine flour from English walnut\r\nshells have exceptionally fine surface finish.\r\n\r\n\r\nInsecticide Carriers\r\n\r\nThe insecticide field provides a good outlet for shell flours. Flour\r\nfrom walnut shells was the first of this type of material to be used for\r\nthis purpose. Often the active ingredient in a finished insecticide is\r\npresent in quantities of less than 1 percent. Custom grinders should\r\nplan to recover the flour as a co-product of their operations rather\r\nthan attempting to grind to flour alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nExplosives\r\n\r\nLarge amounts of shell grits and meal are used as diluents in the\r\nmanufacture of dynamite. Material for this use ranges in size from No.\r\n10 to No. 100, the requirements of the individual manufacturers falling\r\nwithin much narrower limits as to size.\r\n\r\n\r\nFur Cleaning\r\n\r\nFurriers have found that various ground shell products are very\r\neffective agents for cleaning furs. Size requirements for this purpose\r\nare broad, the limits being dependent upon the cleaning equipment\r\nmaintained by the furrier. The natural oils present in some shell\r\nproducts are considered advantageous for this application.\r\n\r\n\r\nSundry Applications\r\n\r\nStock bedding, poultry litters, fillers in feeds and fertilizers,\r\nmulches, charcoal, tannin and abrasives in hand soaps are some of the\r\nother products that are prepared from nut shells. The shell products\r\ncannot be used interchangeably but must be selected in accordance with\r\ntheir chemical and physical properties.\r\n\r\nI hope that the foregoing brief discussion has conveyed to you the\r\npotential value that lies in the piles of shells accumulating at the\r\ncracking plants, and that these accumulations can be converted from\r\nexpensive wastes to profitable products.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: One of the laboratories of the Bureau of Agricultural and\r\nIndustrial Chemistry, Agricultural Research Administration, United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Propagation of the Hickories\r\n\r\n(Panel Discussion led by F. L. O'Rourke, East Lansing, Mich.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: I hope that we can have a rather stimulating session on\r\nhickory propagation this morning. Last year we had a session which was\r\nsupposed to take in propagation of all nut tree species. However, we\r\nnever got away from Chinese chestnuts. It was Chinese chestnuts from the\r\nstart to the finish. The Program Committee this time thought that we\r\nshould limit it to one group, and they chose the hickories.\r\n\r\nI have compiled a review of all the literature pertaining to the\r\nhickories and passed it out yesterday afternoon. I hope that some of you\r\nhave had a chance to read it and will have some questions to ask us this\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nIn order to really have some help, I am going to call upon Mr. Louis\r\nGerardi of Illinois, Mr. Ferguson of Iowa, Mr. Max Hardy of Georgia, Mr.\r\nWard of Indiana, and Mr. Wilkinson also of Indiana and Mr. Bernath of\r\nPoughkeepsie, New York.\r\n\r\nThe subject matter of the panel will be limited to the propagation of\r\nhickories, which includes the pecan.\r\n\r\nWho has some questions that they'd like to bring up?\r\n\r\nMR. SALZER: Which varieties will grow on fairly wet soil?\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: That is a question pertaining to culture, rather than\r\npropagation, but we can still allow it. Which varieties--I presume you\r\nmean species, is that correct?--will grow on fairly wet soil? I think\r\nMr. Ward has a little bit of black soil in that good, old state of\r\nIndiana.\r\n\r\nMR. SALZER: I mean soil that doesn't dry well in the spring. I have one\r\nspot that's too wet for chestnuts.\r\n\r\nMR. WARD: I wouldn't put any hickory nuts on it. You are going to find\r\nit is going to be very difficult for if the soil is the least bit heavy\r\nor wet, the hickory nut does not do well at all. In the Wabash bottoms\r\nthere is a lot of this black soil that is overflowed every year, and\r\nsome of the finest hickory nuts and some of the finest pecans that you\r\ncan find in the country are there. Sometimes I have seen water marks on\r\nthose hickory trees several feet from the ground in the spring of the\r\nyear and sometimes in the summer, yet they come through with a good crop\r\nof nuts. Underneath it is a strata of gravel so that the soil drains out\r\nin a hurry.\r\n\r\nMR. SALZER: This has subsoil drainage.\r\n\r\nMR. WARD: The soil around Rochester is very heavy like what we call\r\nslashland type of soil here in Indiana, and where this occurs we find\r\nthat the hickory nut does very, very poorly. I wouldn't advise putting\r\nthem on such soils. The black walnut will grow a lot better in places\r\nlike that.\r\n\r\nMR. GERARDI: In Illinois we have that deep, black soil and we just call\r\nit plain gumbo. It's all filled-in soil, and I never have reached the\r\nbottom. It's at least 20 feet thick. And these swamp hickories--I think\r\nReed was the one that called them swamp hickories--thrive there. They\r\ncan be two months under water six foot deep, and still bear wonderful\r\ncrops. You can get a wagon load of them in that mucky soil.\r\n\r\nMR. CALDWELL: The hickory in New York State which will stand the most\r\nmoist conditions is the bitternut hickory, and with that root stock you\r\nmay be able to get some of the others through. The shagbark will\r\nwithstand considerable moisture if it has deep soil. The bitternut does\r\nwell on shallow soil or the soil that is made shallow by high water.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: The bitternut, then, will survive wet conditions. This is\r\nof interest as far as root stocks are concerned. I am wondering if\r\nanyone would like to report on the ability of the pecan to take wet soil\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nMR. WILKINSON: They will turn out all right if they have dry feet during\r\nthe summer months, but they will not stand wet feet all summer.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: Will the bitternut do better, or would the mockernut?\r\n\r\nMR. WILKINSON: I am not well enough versed on that to say. But the\r\npecan, I have seen them stand under water for weeks at a time two or\r\nthree times during the winter, water 20 feet deep and not affect them at\r\nall. But if they are around in a place where the water stands in July\r\nand August, they won't take it.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: Any other discussion on stocks that will take wet soil\r\nconditions? If not, let us take up Mr. Beckert's question: When do you\r\ntake scion wood of the shagbark hickory? Who would like to answer that?\r\nMr. Gerardi?\r\n\r\nMR. GERARDI: The time I like best, the time it can be done in our\r\nparticular area is the latter part of February. Leave it on the tree as\r\nlong as you can before any sap rises.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: You would say probably 10 days to 2 weeks before the bud\r\nscales would break?\r\n\r\nMR. GERARDI: That's right, before any growth begins.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: Any other comment on that? Dr. McKay?\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: I want to ask the question about which there is difference of\r\nopinion. Do pecan seed have a rest period, and is there any difference\r\nbetween pecans and hickory in that respect?\r\n\r\nMR. HARDY: I am not sure that I can answer the question exactly. Most\r\npecans planted for seed have been allowed to dry before they are\r\nharvested, and it is general practice to stratify them either in sand\r\nfor planting in the spring or planting them immediately in the fall. I\r\nam inclined to think that there is very little rest period in pecans and\r\nthat if they were planted immediately from the tree that perhaps they\r\nwould begin to grow almost immediately.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: I think that's true. The seed will germinate quickly. But can\r\nyou plant dry seed any time during the winter?\r\n\r\nMR. HARDY: Once they are dried I think they must go through\r\nafter-ripening conditions.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: Do I understand you correctly that you do feel that the\r\npecan must be after-ripened?\r\n\r\nMR. HARDY: Yes, if permitted to dry.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: The work of Burdette in Texas a great many years ago has\r\nindicated that the pecan seed does not have a rest period. Mr.\r\nWilkinson, what has been your experience in germinating pecan seeds?\r\n\r\nMR. WILKINSON: I usually like to either plant or stratify soon after\r\ngathering, although one time I had some off the shelf of a grocery store\r\nin March and got excellent results. One thing more about time of cutting\r\ngraft wood. I never like to cut it for at least 48 hours after a\r\nfreezing temperature, regardless of time. I would rather cut it in April\r\nwith the buds green than to cut it in the first of March right after a\r\nfreeze. I have had excellent results just this spring cutting extra\r\ngraft wood with green buds on. But if you cut it within 48 hours after a\r\nfreezing temperature, you might just as well throw it away.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: I am very glad you brought that out. Irrespective of\r\nwhether it be pecan or hickory, I believe it would work the same, that\r\nthe scion wood should be cut when it is moist, and that is not the\r\ncondition after a freeze, when it is in very dry condition.\r\n\r\nLet's get back to this seed propagation now. I am asking anyone here,\r\ncan you throw any light at all on the need for stratification of pecan\r\nor hickory seed of any species.\r\n\r\nMR. CALDWELL: I have read in several publications that hickories should\r\nbe stratified over the winter period before planting for spring\r\ngermination. I always find things a little bit different, so a year ago\r\nat the greenhouse I took seven different sources of seed of shagbark\r\nhickory, _Carya ovata_ and one source of _Carya ovalis_. Some of those\r\nseeds germinated within three weeks from the time I put them in, and\r\nafter a month and a half I had a full stand in all cases. I don't think\r\nthat more than 2 per cent of the seeds failed to germinate. They were\r\nplanted in warm greenhouse, with a minimum of, about 68 degrees at\r\nnight and about 90 during the day. They were planted in a combination of\r\npeat and garden soil; no special care other than water. I have had no\r\ntrouble since the seedlings have continued to grow, even though the\r\nseeds were planted only two and a half inches deep. So it may be that\r\nthere is no need for stratifying hickories.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: Your experience is the exact duplication of Dr. Lelia\r\nBarton's of the Boyce-Thompson Institute. She found that hickory seeds\r\ngerminated from three weeks, as you did, to a number of months, when put\r\nin a warm greenhouse. Apparently the difference in time is related to\r\nthe thickness of the seed coat or possibly to an inhibitor in the\r\npellicle rather than to any need for after-ripening. I think that\r\nBurdette in Texas also pointed out that thick-shelled pecans took longer\r\nto germinate than thin-shelled pecans.\r\n\r\nMR. PATAKY: If you take a nut of any kind and let it dry and plant it,\r\nyou will get quicker germination than if you plant it soon after\r\nharvest. I don't see any difference in taking a nut and planting it and\r\nstratifying it. If planted the rodents will get it, but if you put it in\r\nsomething all winter, it will be there in the spring. I don't see any\r\nreason for planting a nut in the fall, taking a chance of rodents\r\ngetting at them. If you plant them in the spring, they come up so much\r\nquicker that the rodents don't have a chance to get at them. They got\r\nnearly all of mine that I planted in the fall.\r\n\r\nMR. HARDY: A good many nuts don't have any rest period requirements. I\r\nthink it probably is a matter of convenience as to the manner in which\r\nthey are handled. I have talked with nurserymen in the South. If they\r\nget the nuts in the fall they may either plant them in the fall or\r\nstratify them over winter and then plant them in the rows in the spring.\r\nIf they get them in the spring, they soak them for a day or two days in\r\nwater before planting. Perhaps the dry nut is slow in taking up moisture\r\ndirect from the soil, and they are primarily interested in getting a\r\nuniform stand of trees so that they handle it in such a manner that all\r\nthe nuts will grow at the same time. And I believe many will agree that\r\na dry nut planted in the spring will show considerable variation as to\r\nthe time in which they appear above ground.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: The suggestion of soaking them in water a few days is well\r\ntaken, because a great many have recommended it. Most folks recommend\r\nchanging the water daily. By changing the water you replace the oxygen\r\nwhich would be in the water, and you also eliminate any toxic substances\r\nwhich may have leached out of the shells during the preceding 24 hours.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: I'd like to mention the reason for raising this question. Dr.\r\nCrane has the idea that there is no definite rest period in the pecan\r\nnut; if they are soaked in water they will sprout at any time.\r\n\r\nI decided I would test that hypothesis, so I stratified one group of\r\nnuts of about four pounds. Another lot of four pounds I kept in the\r\nlaboratory dry all winter long. Then I planted the two lots of nuts this\r\nspring together, side by side, in the cold frame. Today there is not a\r\nsingle seedling growing out of the dry lot, and there is a perfect stand\r\nin the group that was stratified.\r\n\r\nTo me that means that there is a definite rest period in the pecan seed.\r\nI don't see how you can get away from it.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: I am going to stick my neck out a little bit. I have\r\nabsolutely no basis to make this statement, but it does give us\r\nsomething to think about. That is the greater the distance towards the\r\nnorth that certain species of plants may have migrated or disseminated,\r\nthe greater the rest period requirement. That is a protective device for\r\na species to persist in northern climates, because if it were not for\r\nthis rest period, those seed would germinate in the fall of the year,\r\nand the young seedlings would be frozen out immediately. But by having\r\nthe rest period requirement over winter, the seedlings do not germinate\r\nuntil the following spring, and the plant can persist. I am speaking now\r\nin general of northern plants. I am wondering if the pecan species in\r\nitself may not be variable in that the southern pecan does not need a\r\nrest period, and the northern pecan is beginning to develop the rest\r\nperiod requirement.\r\n\r\nMR. HARDY: Mr. Chairman, I am inclined to think there may be some other\r\nfactor entering into the picture there. A pecan carried through winter\r\nin a dry condition at normal room temperatures would be liable to\r\ndevelop quite a bit of rancidity by spring. Furthermore, nuts that have\r\nbeen held over so long in a dry condition may still be good and may\r\ngerminate the second year. I'd hesitate to destroy that planting until\r\nnext spring, and to my notion that does not indicate dormancy so much as\r\nit would possibly indicate the inhibition of growth by some other\r\nproducts developed during that storage period.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: You have brought up a very important point and something\r\nwe should not neglect. It may be that drying to a certain degree will\r\ninduce dormancy, a grievously overworked word, but you know what I mean.\r\nIt may take two years for the seed to germinate, as Mr. Hardy has\r\nsuggested. If you can leave them in that cold frame over this winter,\r\nmaybe you can tell us next year just what happened.\r\n\r\nMR. PATAKY: If we take nature's way, watch a squirrel plant a hickory or\r\nblack walnut. He will bury it about an inch deep, and it will stay moist\r\nall winter long, the same as if it were stratified. But if you take a\r\nnut and store in a hot place you are going to slow up or kill that germ.\r\n\r\nYou can do that very easily in a chestnut. Take a little advice from\r\nnature itself in the locality where you are. If you are in the South,\r\nthat nut can start growing in the fall, and it probably won't hurt it,\r\nbut if you are in the North, you don't want to start a nut growing in\r\nthe winter, because it's going to get winter killed.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: In all probability the amount of oxygen about the\r\ngerminating seedling might be quite a factor. The shallow planted seed\r\nwill have more oxygen available than deep planted seed, everything else\r\nbeing equal.\r\n\r\nIf we are finished with the discussion or germination of seeds, we can\r\ngo on to the next question, that of a suitable root stock for\r\nhickory--and that could keep us here for two or three days. Have you had\r\nsome experience, Mr. Ferguson?\r\n\r\nMR. FERGUSON: We use the pecan and the shagbark as root stock for the\r\nhickory group. Formerly we have used some of the bitternut, but we do\r\nnot use it any more. Some of the hickories will grow well on pecan, and\r\nsome are not satisfactory at all. What they will do in old age is hard\r\nto tell. We have a few in the orchard down in Mr. Snyder's farm. I think\r\nwe have Stratford on pecan, which is not satisfactory. Pecan grows too\r\nfast for the Stratford, and some way or other it just doesn't work.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: Are you familiar with Mr. Lassiter's stock work?\r\n\r\nMR. FERGUSON: He has used the Rockville as an intermediate stock on\r\npecan. The Rockville is a hybrid of the pecan and the shellbark.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: Mr. Lassiter sent us a letter in which he stated that he\r\nhad a good variety of shagbark that when grafted on the Rockville\r\nintermediate stock produced much better nuts than on pecans alone. Is\r\nthat due to the exceptional vigor of Rockville which apparently is a\r\nhybrid and may have hybrid vigor? Again, we can only guess. This\r\ninterstock problem is a big problem. We now have some evidence that\r\npecan is not always satisfactory for all varieties of hickory, although\r\nMr. Dunstan at Greensboro, North Carolina, states it's been satisfactory\r\nfor every variety he has worked upon it.\r\n\r\nMR. HARDY: I am inclined to believe that root stocks and scion varieties\r\nworked in the north and grown in the north or worked in the south and\r\ngrown in the south may not react the same.\r\n\r\nMR. WILSON: I think you are right on that.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: Mr. Gilbert Smith's report of yesterday indicated a pecan\r\nwas not satisfactory with him in New York State, and that may bear out\r\nthe comment that Mr. Hardy has made.\r\n\r\nMR. GERARDI: Well, I think that is true enough, myself. In southern\r\nIllinois I find that the bitternut hickory root for shellbark or\r\nshagbark don't seem to be satisfactory at all. With the shagbark on\r\npecan, the variety of shagbark makes a difference. Some varieties of\r\nshagbark, and shellbark hickories seem to do all right, and then again\r\nothers don't. It's going to need further study to determine what\r\nvarieties will stand on pecans, what will stand on bitter hickories, or\r\nwhat will stand on regular ovata stock. I think that the nurseryman's\r\nwisest way is to use stocks of the same species as the scion and then he\r\nis on the safe side. Because the bitter hickory grows faster, the\r\nnurseryman may find it advantageous to grow the bitter hickory stock in\r\npreference to the other two.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: The bitter stock makes a hickory big enough to graft in\r\ntwo or three years.\r\n\r\nMR. GERARDI: In two or three, and four or five for the shagbark.\r\nShagbark or shellbark varieties on bitternut may grow for three or four\r\nyears and then die.\r\n\r\nThe pecan does well on the bitter hickory and the bitter hickory on the\r\npecan, but I have no reason to grow any bitter hickory because I don't\r\nlike the nut. I think it's a waste of time to fool with it that way.\r\n\r\nAs far as the hybrid pecans are concerned, the pecan root is certainly\r\nthe right stock to use on all hybrids. They grow very satisfactorily and\r\nbear well.\r\n\r\nMR. WHITFORD: I have Gerardi and McAllister hybrids growing on pecan,\r\nand the Downing overgrows the pecan.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: To summarize some of this information that we have\r\ngathered this morning on root stocks, it seems that different clones\r\nbehave differently on the same stock. That is true, we know, with other\r\nplants, such as apple. Instead of saying that shagbark is not compatible\r\nwith pecan, perhaps we should say that the Davis or the Wilcox variety\r\nof shagbark is not compatible with a certain type of pecan. It's going\r\nto take years of effort to find out the truth of the matter.\r\n\r\nMR. WARD: Sometimes you will find that a two-year-old scion, if you can\r\nget a dormant bud coming, is better than the matured wood from last\r\nyear. I'd just like to get an opinion from some of the growers what they\r\nuse for topworking stocks for grafting.\r\n\r\nMR. FERGUSON: I think one thing quite important is to get scion wood\r\nthat has a good layer of wood around the pith, whether one-year wood or\r\ntwo-year wood. At the base of the year's growth it will have a lot more\r\nwood in it. At the tip the wood around the pith is thin.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: Some years ago Dr. MacDaniels stated that a good scion may\r\nbe made with the tip of the scion in the one-year wood and the base of\r\nthe scion in the two-year wood.\r\n\r\nMr. Bernath at Poughkeepsie, New York, has done some bench grafting of\r\nhickory. Why other people have not done so, I do not know, and I'd like\r\nMr. Bernath to tell us briefly just why he likes to bench graft hickory.\r\n\r\nMR. BERNATH: I like it because I do my work in the wintertime under\r\nglass. I have no time in the spring to fuss with outside grafting. So if\r\nyou gentlemen would like to hear it, I will tell you all about it.\r\n\r\nMany years ago when I learned my profession, we had difficulty in\r\nfinding a method to graft oaks. We finally did find a method that would\r\ntake and which I have found successful with hickories.\r\n\r\nThe stocks are dug in the fall and stored heeled in earth. When I am\r\nready to graft I put them on a table, along with the scion wood and\r\nstart grafting. I use the side graft at the crown leaving a short spur\r\nabove the graft. Leave them unwaxed and layer them in moss peat in a\r\nglass covered frame in the greenhouse with some ventilation. In three or\r\nfour weeks' time, when the union has formed and just before the leaves\r\ncome out, take them out and plant them in a cold frame outside. Of\r\ncourse you have to put glass on it to protect them from frost, as well\r\nas intense sun. Here you can use part peat and part soil. Leave them\r\nthere for one year in those frames, with partial shade, until they get\r\nfairly high so they shade each other. They can then be set in the\r\nnursery row.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: Mr. Bernath, I know there are some folks here who are\r\nnurserymen and who are interested in the cost of production of a\r\nfinished tree. Do you feel that you can produce a tree to transplant any\r\nheight you want to select, five, six feet, so on, as cheaply according\r\nto this method of bench grafting in the greenhouse as if you bud it or\r\ngraft it in a nursery row?\r\n\r\nMR. BERNATH: That's a question. I have never kept a record of that. It\r\nis all right for a young man who is able to get down on his hands and\r\nknees and graft, but for me that wouldn't do.\r\n\r\nMR. FERGUSON: What temperature do you use in the frames?\r\n\r\nMR. BERNATH: About 65. Sun heat naturally will raise it. Care must be\r\nused to ventilate the frames in the greenhouse to prevent condensation\r\nsoaking the grafts.\r\n\r\nMR. FERGUSON: Do you carry higher temperatures for walnuts?\r\n\r\nMR. BERNATH: All of them about the same. You follow the method just the\r\nsame as nature. If you follow nature, you will never go wrong. But you\r\nhave to watch out for fungus in the case, because if you have excessive\r\ntemperature, the fungus disease will get in your case and ruin the whole\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nMR. WARD: I presume, Mr. Bernath, when you set out a tree and get a\r\nhundred per cent stand it's going to reduce your cost.\r\n\r\nMR. BERNATH: Yes, because you have a better take, because you have\r\neverything under control, moisture, heat, ventilation, and so on.\r\n\r\nMR. BECKERT: Are the hickory stocks potted before you graft, or are you\r\ngrafting bare roots?\r\n\r\nMR. BERNATH: Hickory and oaks are bare rooted. They are too long to pot.\r\n\r\nMR. SHESSLER: How many years are lost in this method of bench grafting\r\ncompared with field grafting trees in the nursery row?\r\n\r\nMR. BERNATH: Quite a few. The gentleman is right, if you graft outside\r\nwhere the tree remains, you get a big growth on it.\r\n\r\nMR. SHESSLER: In other words, a tree grafted out in the field will have\r\nnuts on it three years sooner?\r\n\r\nMR. BERNATH: Yes if you leave it where it is. But if you transplant it,\r\nlook out for a large tree. It is likely to fail.\r\n\r\nBench grafted trees transplant easily. The roots are limited and little\r\nof the root system is destroyed.\r\n\r\nMR. WILKINSON: I have been propagating for about 39 years, and I have\r\ngrafted thousands of pecan trees in my nursery, and I have only a few\r\ntrees growing from grafts. Budding is much more successful with me.\r\nSeveral times I have had up to a 90 per cent stand by budding.\r\n\r\nMR. GERARDI: I have tried bench grafting but it sets you back three\r\nyears in the nursery to get a tree of equal size compared to grafting in\r\nthe nursery row. If you want a small tree, it's all right. And then\r\nagain, it's your help situation. If you have got to set them out, they\r\nhandle the grafts like brush, and I don't like that. Hickory is not hard\r\nto graft in the field. I think if you set 10 you get 9 to grow. For\r\nscions I go back on two-year wood and oftentimes on three-year wood\r\nwhere there are buds. I don't have trouble at all. With pecans, you have\r\na little more difficulty, because the wood is more pithy inside and\r\ndoesn't grow so well.\r\n\r\nMR. BERNATH: With any tree, I don't care what it is, give me one-year\r\ngrowth, this year's growth, and I am going to have wonderful success.\r\nWhen you take the old wood you have to be sure that you have buds.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: This last discussion certainly shows that, there\r\nis more than one way to get results. The fact remains that all these\r\ndifferent men are producing hickory and other trees by various different\r\nmeans of grafting and budding. They have their own techniques which\r\nworked. What there is behind it from a scientific basis we probably\r\ndon't understand too well at the present time.\r\n\r\nI now call on Dr. McKay to present his paper. Dr. McKay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Promising New Pecan for the Northern Zone\r\n\r\nJ. W. MCKAY and H. L. CRANE[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn late 1949 Professor A. F. Vierheller, Extension Horticulturist at the\r\nUniversity of Maryland, College Park, obtained two small pecans from an\r\nexhibit at the Prince Georges County Fair, Upper Marlboro, Maryland,\r\nwhich he sent to the Office of Nut Investigations at Beltsville,\r\nMaryland. These nuts were very thin shelled and contained solid, well\r\ndeveloped kernels very light in color and attractive. We gave them no\r\nparticular heed until the fall of 1951, when the authors together with\r\nProfessor Vierheller, P. E. Clark, County Agent of Prince Georges\r\nCounty, visited the tree on which they had been produced. We found also\r\na number of other pecan trees nearby. All of them were on an old\r\nsouthern Maryland estate known as Brookfield. The present owner is John\r\nC. Duvall, whose address is Naylor, a small southern Maryland community\r\nlocated about 25 miles southeast of Washington, D. C. in the heart of\r\nthe tobacco growing area.\r\n\r\n_Origin of the Duvall trees_: The present trees probably grew from nuts\r\nsent to Maryland from the vicinity of Iron Mountain, Missouri, by a\r\nfriend of the Duvall family named Mrs. Mary Medora Johnson. Mrs. Johnson\r\nhad lived in Maryland as a neighbor of the Duvall family and when she\r\nmoved to Missouri she apparently was so impressed with the native pecan\r\nthat she sent nuts to her friends in Maryland for planting. This must\r\nhave happened about 1850 since the oldest trees at Brookfield are\r\nestimated to be about 100 years old and Mrs. Johnson was a friend of\r\nJohn C. Duvall's grandmother. In terms of the human life span the trees\r\nare thus three generations removed from the time of planting, a time\r\nperiod which fits fairly well the estimated age of 100 years based upon\r\nsize of the trees.\r\n\r\n_Description_: The three largest trees are approximately equal in size\r\nand undoubtedly represent the original planting. The eight other trees\r\nare all smaller and could well have originated as seedlings of the\r\noriginal three. Five of the largest trees have been given numbers 1 to 5\r\nand will be referred to by number. Duvall No. 1, 2 and 5 are the three\r\nlarge trees situated more or less in a circle surrounding the old\r\nmansion, each about 100 yards from the others. The smaller trees are\r\nlocated more or less between and around the larger ones, the old mansion\r\nbeing on a slight knoll in the center of the planting. The original\r\ndwelling of Brookfield is now crumbling ruins, part of the building\r\nbeing more than 200 years old, according to Mr. Duvall, who lives in a\r\nmodern new country home across the road from the original mansion. The\r\nthree large trees have a diameter at breast height of approximately 4\r\nfeet and all of them have a branch spread of more than 150 feet. They\r\nare 75 to 100 feet tall. All of the trees have very narrow and pointed\r\nleaflets characteristic of Texas and southwestern varieties, and they\r\nare remarkably free of insect pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts from this group of seedlings are variable in size and\r\nappearance as might be expected of those from any group of pecan\r\nseedlings. However, one of the most striking characteristics of all the\r\nnuts is that the kernels are solid and well developed. This is an\r\nunusual characteristic for pecans grown in the latitude of Washington,\r\nD. C. In all of the varieties that are usually grown in this area none\r\nwhich regularly fill their nuts well are known. Another outstanding\r\ncharacteristic of all of the nuts produced by these seedlings is the\r\nbright, attractive color of the kernel. In fact, when the nuts of Duvall\r\nNo. 1 are promptly harvested and dried in the fall, the kernels are\r\nalmost white. Nuts that stayed on the ground 6 months during the winter\r\nof 1951-52 were harvested in late March 1952 and the kernels were still\r\nin good condition. Some of the nuts were on display at the Rockport\r\nmeetings. Small size of nut is without question the chief undesirable\r\ncharacteristic of these trees. Duvall No. 5 produces the largest nuts of\r\nall the seedlings but they are so small that more than 100 are required\r\nto weigh a pound. Duvall No. 1 produces the smallest nuts and almost 200\r\nare required to weigh a pound.\r\n\r\n_Past Yields_: The one characteristic that sets these trees apart from\r\nall other pecan trees that we have observed in the Maryland area is that\r\nthey yield heavy crops of nuts every year. We have known the trees only\r\nsince the fall of 1951 but have observed two crops and Mr. Duvall has\r\nobserved their performance for many years. In the fall of 1951 Duvall\r\nNo. 2 yielded an estimated 8 to 10 bushels of nuts. Mr. Duvall harvested\r\n3 bushels and he knew that 3 bushels were harvested by friends of the\r\nfamily. An unknown quantity estimated at several bushels was plowed\r\nunder when wheat was sown shortly before we visited the tree in the fall\r\nof 1951. The tree had a heavy set of nuts in August 1952 and Mr. Duvall\r\npredicted that it would probably yield as much this year as last. He\r\ntold us that the three oldest trees always have had annual crops of nuts\r\nexcept for 1 or 2 years when one of the trees failed to produce as much\r\nas usual. He could not remember which of the trees produced the light\r\ncrops but he was certain that light crops were borne at only very\r\ninfrequent intervals.\r\n\r\n_Sweeney Tree_: The two nuts originally sent us by Professor Vierheller\r\nwere produced by a tree growing approximately 200 yards from the nearest\r\nDuvall tree on a part of the farm recently subdivided and now occupied\r\nby a tenant named Sweeney. Mrs. Sweeney placed the plate of nuts on\r\nexhibit at the Prince Georges County Fair and from this plate Professor\r\nVierheller procured the sample which he sent. Hence this tree has become\r\nknown informally as the Sweeney tree. Its nuts are very long and pointed\r\nbut in other respects resemble very closely those produced by the other\r\ntrees. The Sweeney tree is undoubtedly a seedling of one of the three\r\nlarge Duvall trees. This tree also has an impressive yield record, as\r\nMrs. Sweeney said that she has harvested a bushel or more of nuts from\r\nthe tree every year during the ten or more years that she has lived on\r\nthe place. In 1952 the Sweeney tree was bearing a heavy crop of nuts.\r\n\r\n_Soil_: The trees growing on soil that is classified as Sassafras fine\r\nsandy loam in the heart of the southern Maryland tobacco growing\r\ndistrict. This soil type, one of the best agricultural soils of the\r\narea, is not generally regarded as one of high fertility. This soil is\r\nwell drained and aerated and friable to a considerable depth, thus\r\npermitting the trees to root deeply. None of the trees are growing under\r\ncrowded conditions since they are located around the margins of the\r\nbuilding sites of the old homestead. The question now is whether grafted\r\ntrees propagated from the best of the Duvall seedlings will yield heavy\r\ncrops of well filled nuts that will mature early under other conditions\r\nof soil and climate in other localities. We are inclined to believe that\r\nsome or all of these trees may represent a line of pecan genetically\r\nconstituted to bear heavy crops of nuts every year under conditions in\r\nMaryland. If trees propagated from the Duvall trees will perform\r\nelsewhere in the northern zone there will be available for this area a\r\nnew type of pecan that we feel will be distinctly worthwhile\r\nnotwithstanding the small size of the nuts. Present varieties of the\r\nso-called northern pecan grown in the northern zone perform erratically\r\nat best and when many of the varieties produce crops the nuts fail to\r\nmature and fill properly.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Horticulturist and Principal Horticulturist, Bureau of\r\nPlant Industry, Soils, and Agricultural Engineering, United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, Beltsville, Maryland.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hickory in Indiana\r\n\r\nW. B. WARD, _Department of Horticulture, Purdue University, Lafayette,\r\nInd._\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Charles C. Deam, forester, naturalist and botanist, in his book\r\n\"Trees of Indiana,\" revised 1952, lists seven distinct types of hickory\r\nin the state and nine sub species. As Deam is approaching his 87th year\r\n(August 30), he makes this statement: \"I thought I knew trees, and\r\nhickories especially, but at this time when I can hardly see and write I\r\nfind there is a great need for reclassification.\" What is true in\r\nIndiana is no doubt true in other areas where _Hicoria_ grows--each year\r\nnew seedlings and hybrids are found that just step out of any previous\r\ndescription and a new tree may result or change the published data.\r\n\r\nSome trees develop five leaflets, while others have seven and nine\r\nleaflets. The bark may be smooth, rough, scaly, or shag. The nuts will\r\nvary in size and form with a thin to quite thick shell. This, of course,\r\napplies to the seedlings as the grafted or budded varieties vary only\r\nwith the location, season, and growing conditions.\r\n\r\nThe present classification, according to Deam, is as follows:\r\n\r\n   1. _Carya pecan_--Pecan.\r\n   2. _C. cordiformis_--Bitternut.\r\n   3. _C. ovata_--Shagbark and 2 sub species--_fraxinifolia_ and _nuttali_.\r\n   4. _C. laciniosa_--Bigleaf Shagbark (Shellbark).\r\n   5. _C. tomentosa (alba)_--Mockernut--one sub species.\r\n   6. _C. glabra_--Pignut and sub species--Black Hickory.\r\n   7. _C. ovalis_--Small-Fruited Hickory and 5 sub species.\r\n   8. _C. pallida_  }\r\n   9. _C. buckleyi_ } --Minor species of lesser importance.\r\n\r\nThe hickory species thrive in Indiana, doing very well in all sections\r\nexcept in certain portions of the northwestern part of the state and on\r\nmuck or sandy soils. The tree loves company or does well alone. When the\r\nhickory stands alone, the trees are well formed and make a good\r\nspecimen tree. Many hickory trees are found growing in the river bottom\r\nland from Central to Southern Indiana with fewer trees found north of a\r\nline extending from Terre Haute through Indianapolis to Richmond. This\r\nsouthern area also contains the largest population of pecans. There are\r\nsome woods that contain only pecan trees while a mile or so away no\r\npecans are found but all are hickories and occasionally some woods\r\ncontain both pecan and hickory. The trees in the woods areas, many of\r\nwhich seem to be the same species, produce a wide variety of fruits.\r\nWhen the trees are more closely examined there is a difference in the\r\nbark, the branch, the leaf, pubescence, shape of nut and shell\r\nstructure. As there are all seedling trees in this particular woods,\r\nseveral outstanding trees have been checked and especially as to\r\ncracking qualities of the nuts. At harvest time a hammer is part of the\r\nequipment and the nuts are cracked at the tree and the tree marked for\r\ndiscard or further consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Possibilities of the Hickory\r\n\r\nThe hickory nut has not reached the popularity of the pecan, although\r\nthe hickory contains more protein and slightly less fat, carbohydrates,\r\nand calories per pound than the pecan. Where the pecan does not fruit,\r\nthe better hickories, which are hardy, fill the need. The named\r\nvarieties are good and trees are available from some nurserymen. The\r\npropagators have developed a few new crosses but man is far behind\r\nnature in this work. The many new seedling trees scattered all over the\r\nregions where the hickory grows require only propagation and\r\ndistribution for wider acclaim.\r\n\r\nThe development of a new hickory is a long-time process, yet may be\r\nhastened by first planting the nuts for new seedlings and when the\r\ngrowth is mature to bud or graft the seedling on large rootstocks. When\r\nold trees have been top-worked it is only two or three years' time until\r\nthe fruit develops and, if worthy of propagation, much time may be saved\r\nby this method.\r\n\r\nMost of the hickories have either 32 or 64 chromosomes, except pecan\r\nwhich varies from 20 to 24 to possibly 32. The chances of making\r\nsuitable crosses between the pecan and hickory are most difficult yet it\r\nappears that these chance crosses result from time to time as in the\r\nhican through natural cross pollination.\r\n\r\nHow extensive will be the plantings of the hickories is yet to be\r\ndetermined but it is a known fact that many people, especially north of\r\nthe route of Federal Highway 40, prefer the hickory to the pecan. This\r\nmay be due to the fact that from childhood the hickory was the local\r\nfruit. The fruit and tree hold great promise for the future. If the\r\nhickories are to be of commercial importance, the work must be done by\r\nall concerned and not left to a few eager individuals to carry on the\r\nwork alone.\r\n\r\nMR. MACHOVINA: Mr. Chairman, members of the Association, I hope you will\r\nbear with me if I run 30 seconds over. Perhaps I had better point out\r\nthat my training is that of an engineer and not a botanist, hence this\r\nreport on the Merrick tree is that of a layman. I have not bothered to\r\ngo into detail on the various features of the tree, such as leaves,\r\nbuds, and so forth, because I have slides which you will see afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Merrick Hybrid Walnut\r\n\r\nP. E. MACHOVINA, _Columbus, Ohio_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Merrick hybrid walnut is a natural cross between Persian and black\r\nwalnut and is distinguished from most other such hybrids by the good\r\ncrops it usually bears. The tree is located in Rome Township, Athens\r\nCounty, Ohio, on property owned by Mr. M. M. Merrick a farmer and fruit\r\ngrower.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1950, Mr. Merrick first described his \"English\" walnut to the\r\nwriter and arrangements were made to view the tree. Most striking at\r\nfirst sight was the large crop of nuts. The general outward appearance\r\nof the tree suggested it to be pure Persian; however, upon closer\r\nexamination, mixed parentage became evident. As a hybrid, the tree's\r\nhistory was a matter of interest and the owner was happy to supply what\r\ninformation he could.\r\n\r\nMr. Merrick purchased the property on which the hybrid is located, in\r\n1921. A few years prior to this, the previous owner had planted six\r\nPersian walnut trees obtained from a nursery in northern Ohio. These\r\nyoung trees bore their first crop of nuts during Mr. Merrick's first\r\nyear of ownership. It is known that the nursery owners were also\r\nproprietors of a commercial Persian walnut orchard located in the\r\nvicinity of Niagara Falls. With this combination of date and orchard\r\nlocation, it seems not illogical to presume that the six nursery trees\r\nwere of the Pomeroy strain. From Mr. Merrick's description of the nuts\r\nproduced by these trees, they appear to have been two each of three\r\ndifferent grafted varieties. In the early nineteen-thirties, Mr. Merrick\r\nplanted several nuts from the Persian trees and raised a number of\r\nseedlings. One of these seedlings, transplanted to its present location,\r\nis the subject of this discussion and is presumed to be a cross between\r\none of the six Persians and a native black walnut. During the late\r\nnineteen-thirties, all of the trees, Persians and seedlings, with the\r\nsingle exception of the existing hybrid, were killed by an unusually\r\nhard winter.\r\n\r\nThe Merrick hybrid walnut, now about 20 years of age, is an extremely\r\nvigorous and healthy tree. Its height is between 55 and 60 feet and its\r\nspread nearly as great. Trunk diameter is at present about 12 inches at\r\nbreast height. The location of the tree is very favorable, being near\r\nthe crest of a high ridge and with protection from the northwest by the\r\nhouse. A chicken yard is near and the kitchen drain empties close by to\r\nsupply moisture.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all aspects excepting the nut itself, the tree favors its\r\npistillate parent. This is evidenced by the general shape of the tree,\r\nby the texture and color of the bark of limbs and twigs, and by the\r\nshape and color of the leaves, the buds, the flowers, and the nut hull.\r\nHybridity is indicated by the (usually) eleven leaflets to the leaf\r\nstem, by the nut, and in the disintegration of the hull which, after\r\nfalling, quickly changes into a most disagreeable, dark-brownish,\r\nsemi-liquidlike mess. The nut itself is much more like a Persian walnut\r\nin appearance than a black walnut. The shell surface is slightly rougher\r\nand somewhat darker than most Persian nuts. The suture of the Persian\r\nparent is prominent. Black walnut parentage is exhibited by the thick\r\nshell, the interior configuration and in the flavor of the small kernel.\r\nNut size varies somewhat with diameters ranging from 1 to 1-1/4 inches\r\nand lengths ranging from 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 inches.\r\n\r\nThe bloom, which is strikingly like that of pure Persian trees, is\r\nalways profuse and precedes that of the surrounding native black walnuts\r\nby a week or two. In the two years during which the writer has observed\r\nthe tree, the greater part of the staminate bloom has preceded the\r\npistillate by several days. This was noticeably the case during the\r\ncurrent year, and either this, or the rainy weather, has resulted in a\r\nsmall set of nuts which the owner states to be unusual. During the years\r\nobserved, the tree appeared to be self-pollinating.\r\n\r\nIt is recognized, of course, that the Merrick hybrid is worthless as a\r\nproducer of edible nuts. The possible value of the tree lies in\r\nopportunities it offers in being the forbearer of more worthwhile\r\nprogeny. We know of the vast possibilities in hybridization. We know of\r\nthe difficulties involved in obtaining nuts from controlled crosses\r\nbetween Persian and black walnut trees; and we know that seedling trees\r\nraised from the nuts of such crosses are almost always sterile. The\r\nMerrick hybrid, yielding good crops, offers possibilities both in\r\ncrossbreeding and in the raising of seedling trees from the nuts of the\r\ntree itself. In the latter connection, Drs. Crane and McKay, of the\r\nU.S.D.A., requested several pounds of Merrick nuts for planting purposes\r\nthis spring. The writer himself planted five such nuts, of which four\r\ngerminated. Of the four trees, one died early in the season, while the\r\nremaining three have thrived. The heights attained by the three\r\nremaining trees thus far this season are 1, 2, and 3 feet, respectively.\r\nThese trees have the general appearance of young Persian seedlings.\r\n\r\nThe only crossbreeding attempted thus far ended in failure when a storm\r\ndestroyed most of the bags prior to application of pollen. Persian\r\npollen was used on the few bloom remaining covered but, unfortunately,\r\nno nuts were set. The experiment will be continued. Also, the Merrick\r\nwill be topworked onto producing walnuts, both Persian and black, in the\r\nhope of obtaining nuts from which interesting and perhaps better second\r\ngeneration hybrids can be raised.\r\n\r\nAn interesting point of conjecture on which to terminate this report,\r\nand one to which nut experts will likely give little credence, may be\r\nfound in a statement made by Mr. Merrick and vouched to by Mrs. Merrick.\r\nThe statement is to the effect that the nuts borne by the Merrick during\r\nits early years, that is, prior to the time the adjacent Persians were\r\nkilled, were of much better quality, being more like Persian walnuts\r\nboth in appearance and in flavor. We've heard of \"pollen influence\" with\r\nchestnuts. Did it occur here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION\r\n\r\nProducing Quality Nuts and Quality Logs\r\n\r\nL. E. SAWYER, _Director, Division of Forestry and Reclamation, Indiana\r\nCoal Producers Association_\r\n\r\n\r\nI was trained as a forester and having worked at the profession for\r\nnearly thirty years, my first thought of trees is for their utility in\r\nbuilding or in cabinet work. In school we were taught that the fruit of\r\nforest trees was a by-product. Its economic importance was not\r\nemphasized nor was the possibility of establishing stands of some\r\nspecies specifically for the production of their fruit.\r\n\r\nThrough the years the value of the nut crop from some species has\r\nincreased so that the fruit is now the primary crop and any wood\r\nmaterials that may be derived are the by-product. This production of\r\nvaluable food and necessary materials of high quality for the building\r\nof quality furniture and interior finish is a combination that will work\r\nwell together.\r\n\r\nBlack walnut, the most highly utilized of any of our native timber for\r\nfurniture, veneer, and cabinet work is becoming increasingly more\r\ndifficult for the mills to obtain in larger sized logs. Native chestnut,\r\nalmost completely destroyed in our timbered areas by the chestnut\r\nblight, is in demand for interior finish. Pecan, which has had only a\r\nlimited use in the past, is now enjoying a market for the manufacture of\r\nflooring.\r\n\r\nThe production of nuts from plantations or orchards of these three\r\nspecies will no doubt produce greater economic returns for many years\r\nafter the initial planting than could be derived from the sale of the\r\ntrees for the wood they contain. There will come a time in the life of\r\nany tree when it is no longer a profitable producer and should be\r\nreplaced by a younger, more thrifty tree. When that time comes, the tree\r\nto be removed will have no economic value unless it contains products\r\nthat industry can use. With the thought in mind that the wood from the\r\ntree is to have some future economic value the trunk of the tree should\r\nbe kept free of all limbs to a height of about nine feet above the\r\nground. The development of a large spreading top above that point will\r\nbe desirable for nut production. The space below that top will give\r\nample head room for maintenance work in the orchard and that clear\r\nlength of trunk will produce a high quality log eight feet long. That is\r\nthe minimum standard length normally used by the lumber industry. Some\r\nshorter lengths are utilized by the veneer industry but those lengths\r\nusually command a lower unit price.\r\n\r\nThe production of figured walnut could be combined with the production\r\nof one log per tree but it would take several more years to bring the\r\ntrees to nut producing age. Mr. Wilkinson has successfully demonstrated\r\nthat the figure of the Lamb Walnut does carry over through a graft or\r\nbud.\r\n\r\nA double budding operation should not be difficult to perform. It would\r\nsimply consist of budding the figured stock on the root at as low a\r\npoint as possible, then when the figured growth has reached sufficient\r\nheight, of budding again to the desired variety for nut production. This\r\nprocedure would no doubt require a few additional years before the first\r\ncrop of fruit would be harvested but it would produce an extremely\r\nvaluable log when the tree is finally cut.\r\n\r\nI would be remiss in my present job if I did not bring the revegetation\r\nprogram of the Indiana coal stripping industry into the discussion. That\r\nindustry produces over fifty percent of the coal mined in Indiana today\r\nand is recovering coal that could not be mined by any other means.\r\n\r\nIn driving to Rockport many of you no doubt passed by areas of newly\r\nmined land, rough, barren desolate looking areas with no vegetation.\r\nThey have the appearance of complete desolation and give the impression\r\nthat those lands are forever lost. In that same vicinity you no doubt\r\npassed plantations of pine, or mixture of pine or Locust with our native\r\ndeciduous species. Those too were mined areas that a few short years ago\r\nwere just as desolate in appearance as the bare areas you saw. These\r\nplantations are the direct result of a reclamation program started by\r\nthe members of the Indiana Coal Producers Association, a program that\r\nhas attracted national attention.\r\n\r\nThe first record of an attempt at the reclamation of coal mine spoil is\r\nhere in Indiana. In 1918, the Rowland Power Company, now owned by the\r\nMaumee Collieries Company, planted peach, apple and pear trees on mined\r\nland in Owen county. The records show that for a period of years the\r\ntrees thrived and were good producers. Then, because the topography was\r\nrough and no spraying was done, disease and insects took their toll of\r\nthe peaches and apples. Seedlings of the original apple and peach tree\r\nstill grow on the area. The original Kieffer pear trees still stand and\r\nproduce large crops of fruit.\r\n\r\nIn 1926, the larger, more far sighted companies began a definite program\r\nof reforestation of their mined lands under the direction of Ralph\r\nWilcox, at that time assistant State Forester and fortunately our State\r\nForester today. That voluntary program was carried on until 1941 when\r\nthe Indiana Coal Producers Association, the Association of the mining\r\ncompanies, sat down with representatives of the Indiana Department of\r\nConservation, representing the state, and the Indiana Farm Bureau,\r\nrepresenting the people, and drafted a bill which was enacted into law.\r\nThis law required each company to obtain a permit from the state to\r\noperate and required that each company revegetate an area each year\r\nequal to 101% of the area they had mined. To insure compliance, a bond\r\nwas required. This law remained in effect for ten years. In 1951,\r\nrepresentatives of those same groups again sat down together and drafted\r\nseveral amendments to the original act. Some grading is now required\r\nwhere areas lie adjacent to public roads. Access roads must be provided\r\nand areas to be devoted to pasture must be graded so that they can be\r\ntraversed with agricultural machinery.\r\n\r\nUnder this program, sponsored by Industry, the Farm Bureau, and the\r\nDepartment of Conservation, 79% of the area that has been mined to date\r\nhas been successfully revegetated. The remaining 21% is a natural lag\r\nand represents lands newly mined or areas that have not weathered to the\r\npoint where they will support revegetation. The demand for recreation\r\nlands and home sites where water is available is constantly increasing.\r\nAt least 13% of the revegetated area is now being used for public\r\nrecreation or for home sites. Near the more heavily populated sections\r\nthe price commanded by mined territory containing good lakes often\r\nexceeds the value of the land before it was mined.\r\n\r\nThese lakes, formed in the final cuts and in low lying areas of the\r\nstrip mines, furnish the only clean, clear water available for public\r\nrecreation and fishing in the south western part of the state.\r\n\r\nThe reforestation being carried on under the reclamation program\r\nconsists of planting several species of pines, as well as a large\r\nvariety of our native deciduous trees. The older plantations are being\r\nused as a guide as the research started in the last eight years has not\r\nprogressed far enough to give conclusive results on many points. Until\r\nthe last few years the Agricultural Experiment Station has devoted\r\nlittle or no time to the problem of reclaiming strip mine spoil. The\r\narea of the state that is involved, less than 1/4 of 1%, has been too\r\nsmall to justify the use of their limited funds. However, since funds\r\nhave been made available to that Station, through the Industry, to\r\nestablish research fellowships, the Station has given whole hearted\r\ncooperation. The information being obtained through these fellowships\r\nand through work being carried on cooperatively with the Central States\r\nForest Experiment Station is going to answer many of the questions on\r\nreclamation we have been confronted with.\r\n\r\nIncluded in our reforestation has been a liberal scattering of black\r\nwalnut. A breakdown of species is not available on much of the earlier\r\nwork but since 1940, when accurate records have been maintained, we have\r\nplanted 239,000 black walnut seedlings or seed. Initial survival is not\r\nhigh, averaging only about 50 percent but we still have a general\r\ndistribution of seed trees that are providing a source of seed for\r\nnatural reproduction. Trees from plantings made in 1927 to 1934 have\r\ngrown well and we now have walnut trees over 10 inches in diameter and\r\n60 feet in height. The average for all areas would probably not exceed 5\r\ninches but individual trees have made remarkable growth. These trees are\r\nonly seedlings, but they are bearing heavily and their fruit is sought\r\nby the local people.\r\n\r\nIn 1946 and 1947, budded stock of walnuts and pecans and seedlings of\r\nChinese chestnut were obtained from Mr. Wilkinson and were set out on\r\nsix selected areas. A wide variety of sites were picked and a wide\r\nvariation in both survival and growth has been obtained. No special\r\ntreatment was given the areas where the trees were to be planted nor\r\nwere the trees mulched or watered after planting. Even under these\r\nrugged conditions we have a survival of over 60 percent of all trees.\r\nThe walnut trees now range from 5 to 12 feet in height and the pecans up\r\nto 6 feet. The chestnuts vary in form from low spreading plants 4-1/2 to\r\n5 feet in height and as much as 8 feet across to well formed trees 8 to\r\n10 feet tall. Pruning on all three species to produce a clear butt log\r\nhas been started.\r\n\r\nPasture seeding on areas high enough in available lime to support\r\nlegumes is following a pattern laid down by three years of graduate\r\nstudy, financed by the Indiana Coal Producers Association, at Purdue and\r\nby work done by the Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station under a\r\nsimilar arrangement with the Illinois Coal Strippers Association.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we have only a small portion of the spoil area in Indiana\r\nthat is suitable for the development of improved pasture. Not over 10\r\npercent of the area mined to date is good enough and that percentage\r\nwill decrease. Modern operations are deeper than the early ones and are\r\nexposing more hard rock and shale. Fortunately, most of these areas can\r\nbe reforested after three or four years. In exceptional cases less than\r\n5 percent of the area mined the exposed materials contain large amounts\r\nof sulfides. These break down into acid that in some cases require ten\r\nto twelve years to leach out before revegetation can be undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these stands of trees established on raw spoil will\r\nproduce merchantable timber has been proven. In 1951, an area was clear\r\ncut at the Enos mine in Pike county. The pines on this tract were\r\nplanted in 1933-34. The products from that cutting, peeled posts and\r\npoles, were sold to the Indiana Wood Preserving Company at the rate of\r\n$335.59 per acre. An increase in value of $16.48 per acre per year.\r\n\r\nPasture, forests and fishing are not the only products. Game of all\r\nvarieties is abundant in the worked out areas. One of the largest herds\r\nof white tailed deer in the state, now referred to as the strip mine\r\nherd, is located in northern Warrick and southern Pike counties. In the\r\nIndiana deer season of 1951, the first open season since 1893, the\r\nsecond largest recorded kill came from the strip mine herd. The\r\nPitman-Robertson report of the Division of Fish and Game carries the\r\nfollowing comment on deer from that area. \"The superiority of the\r\ndiversified range of the strip mine herd was reflected in above average\r\nweights and measurements in most age classes.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence at hand, there is every reason to believe that most of\r\nthe mined area will again be highly productive forest land. It has\r\ncompleted the entire cycle of land use. Originally it supported\r\nmagnificent stands of hardwood timber. This timber was cut and the lands\r\ndevoted to farming. Poor management and erosion soon depleted the supply\r\nof top soil and many areas were abandoned to broom sedge, blackberries\r\nand gullies. Because it was close enough to the surface the coal has\r\nbeen removed and the areas replanted to many of the same species of\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nWith this reestablishment of the forest cover and the creation of the\r\nlakes in the final cuts, we can again have our forest resource combined\r\nwith fishing, hunting and other forms of outdoor recreation, some areas\r\nof pasture and, I believe, others that can be profitably devoted to the\r\nproduction of nut crops and the by-product of quality logs for the\r\nveneer and lumber industry.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: If you ever think you are going to sell your logs\r\nfor veneer or lumber, don't nail hammocks or other things on the trees.\r\nThe metal is very soon buried and causes no end of difficulty. We will\r\ngo to the next paper, which is, \"Colchicine as a Tool in Nut Breeding,\"\r\nMr. O. J. Eigsti, Funk Brothers Seed Co., Bloomington, Illinois.\r\n\r\nMR. EIGSTI: Three years ago this project was conceived in a discussion\r\nbetween Mr. Best and myself. Then during the two-year period, all I did\r\nwas turn over some Colchicine to Mr. Best. Mr. Best took the material,\r\ntreated the trees and performed as well as any graduate student I had\r\never graduated in the 13 years that I was in university work. It is\r\nthrough his fine cooperation that we are able to start this project, and\r\nI look forward to this developing into a rather important nut breeding\r\nventure. But as you all know, it will take a long time. I have this\r\npaper written. It's only four pages double-spaced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColchicine for Nut Improvement Programs\r\n\r\nO. J. EIGSTI and R. B. BEST, _Normal, Illinois, and Eldred, Illinois_\r\n\r\n\r\nColchicine (1, 2) as a plant breeders' tool is universally well known.\r\nOnly limited use has been made of this technique for nut improvement.\r\nEarly work was started by Dr. J. W. McKay, a member of the N.N.G.A., but\r\nnumerous other problems demanded his attention and the Colchicine\r\nproject was not carried to final completion. Other reports are at hand\r\nfrom Sweden and Japan but these results do not shed direct light on the\r\nproblems under discussion today at Rockport, Indiana.\r\n\r\nColchicine, acting on cell-division, ultimately causes a doubling of the\r\nnumber of chromosomes within those cells in contact with the substance\r\nat the time of division. Such changes are transferred to succeeding\r\ngenerations by the hereditary chain familiar to plant breeders. Several\r\nspecies of nuts are among this class of plants with doubled chromosomal\r\nnumbers, however, such duplications occurred in nature. A report on this\r\nphase was given at a recent meeting of the N.N.G.A. Therefore such\r\nexcellent nut producing species as the pecan are naturally doubled\r\ntypes, called polyploids. We find numbers such as 32 representative of a\r\npolyploid situation.\r\n\r\nSince colchicine is effective in doubling the chromosome number and that\r\nvariations in chromosome number exist among species, the authors planned\r\na series of experiments to determine the best methods of applying\r\ncolchicine toward a nut improvement program. Seedlings of pecan were\r\navailable and out of this experience a schedule is submitted that may be\r\nof use for other members of this association confronted with particular\r\nproblems applicable to colchicine techniques.\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory schedule for doubling the number of chromosomes is\r\ngiven in a number of steps as listed below.\r\n\r\n1) Select expanding vegetative buds in the earliest stages of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n2) Use seedlings or branches from mature trees.\r\n\r\n3) Prune leaves and probe to the growing cone without damage to tissue.\r\n\r\n4) Pack a small wad of cotton into the terminal point.\r\n\r\n5) Soak this cotton by dropping .2% aqueous solution of colchicine on\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n6) Add glycerine to cotton to improve penetration of colchicine.\r\n\r\n7) Place drop of colchicine on cotton morning and evening for four days.\r\n\r\n8) Remove cotton wading from bud on 5th day.\r\n\r\n9) If sufficient tests at hand, allow cotton to remain on some buds.\r\n\r\n10) Try for at least one hundred buds treated.\r\n\r\n11) Observe growth during first season and also next season.\r\n\r\n12) If treated bud dies, watch for growth among lower laterals.\r\n\r\n13) Evidence of changes appears in the new leaves, darker, thicker,\r\ngreener.\r\n\r\n14) Conclusive evidence of doubling rests with microscopic and\r\nanatomical analysis which is a task for trained technicians only.\r\n\r\nThe above procedures are suggestions for a start and everyone will wish\r\nto make changes suited to his particular needs. The concentration of\r\ncolchicine need not be exact as in an analytical experiment in\r\nchemistry. One gram dissolved in 500 ml. water is an adequate and a\r\nsufficiently careful measurement. The local pharmacist or physician is\r\nwell acquainted with colchicine in the practise of medicine since this\r\ndrug is a standard for gout.\r\n\r\nEffective use may be made from two specific areas of plant breeding.\r\nFirst, doubling of chromosomes changes sterile hybrids into fertile\r\nindividuals. This is a promising field and whenever such hybrids are\r\ndiscovered, efforts should be made to apply the colchicine technique.\r\nSecond, doubling of the chromosome number makes possible hybridization\r\nof individuals heretofore unsuccessful in such effort. In both instances\r\ngerm plasm of wide genetic difference is incorporated into a new\r\npropagating breeding stock. In the case of the sterile hybrid\r\ntransformed into fertile individuals, no counting of chromosomes is\r\nnecessary because restoration of fertility is evidence of changes in the\r\nchromosomal makeup. However, the second type of experiment requires\r\nmicroscopic analysis.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of fundamental research problems in the plant\r\nsciences associated with the treatment of plants with colchicine. From\r\nhorticultural subjects such as the apple,(3) pear, cranberries,(4) and\r\ngrapes, it is obvious that periclinal chimeras will be of prime\r\nimportance in analysis of results in treatment of nut trees. Following\r\nthe treatment of a growing point with colchicine the outer layer of\r\ncells may be doubled by colchicine but the lower layers may remain\r\nunchanged. Or a reverse of this situation may obtain, and even other\r\ntypes. Since the formation of pollen takes place from a certain layer it\r\nis very important that such specific layers are changed. The course of\r\nplant breeding can be altered by these kinds of changes. To our\r\nknowledge, no investigations of periclinal chimeras have been made with\r\nnuts, following treatment with colchicine.\r\n\r\nSpecific experiments were conducted at Eldred, Illinois in the spring of\r\n1951 with seedlings of pecan. The cooperation of the R.B. Best Farms and\r\nNut Plantation made this project possible. Several types of treatment\r\nwere tried. Out of this experience the above schedule listed in 14 steps\r\nwas developed. Other details may be obtained by contacting the authors\r\ndirect. Observations of the new growth in 1951 and 1952 were made and\r\nthe shape of leaves, color, texture and general appearance suggest that\r\ndoubling of chromosomes has been induced. Up until the present time, no\r\nmicroscopic analysis has been made but this is a contemplated step and\r\nfacilities are at hand to complete this work.\r\n\r\nWhile this paper is not a completed research, the authors hope that the\r\npresentation of technique will aid and stimulate interest in this new\r\napproach to nut improvement. In such instances where certain members may\r\nhave a particular problem such as a true hybrid-sterile as a result of\r\nhybridity, it is hoped that the suggestions given in the above pages may\r\nlead into a new field of improvement. There are rewards in store for the\r\nplant breeder willing to master this new technique, but the mastery\r\nrequires careful study and diligent work.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiterature Cited\r\n\r\n   1.

RICHARDS: There came under my observation in the latter part of last\r\nsummer a seedling pecan tree growing in the city limits of my home town.\r\nIt seemed that this tree had been growing unnoticed for possibly 50\r\nyears, judging by the size of the tree. The outstanding thing about this\r\ntree and what called it to my attention was a patient who came into my\r\noffice complaining with a backache from picking up pecans on the 20th\r\nday of August.\r\n\r\nI wrote my friend, Mr. J. C. McDaniel, about this pecan, and when he\r\nvisited me during the Christmas holidays I gave him a sample. The only\r\nthing that he could say bad about the pecan was that it was slightly on\r\nthe small side. I know personally that at least three or possibly four\r\nbushels of good quality nuts were harvested from that tree, most of them\r\non the ground by the 20th of August.\r\n\r\nIn my section the Stuart pecan, which we use more or less as a\r\nyard-stick, was ripe the latter part of October, and we thought that\r\npossibly this tree, since it had undergone an unusually low temperature\r\nthe winter before of 20 below zero, might have possibilities.\r\n\r\nBut let's dispense with this pecan and say that we believe in the old\r\nadage that one raindrop doesn't make a shower. It has a fair crop this\r\nyear, and they are just as green as my Stuarts now.\r\n\r\nThere is another tree that originated in West Tennessee which Mr.\r\nMcDaniel chose to call this nut \"Rhodes heartnut.\" This tree is 7 years\r\nold from a dormant bud on a 2-year-old black walnut seedling growing on\r\nmy back yard. It bore two clusters its second growing season, and since\r\nthat time it has borne annually, the crops increasing in proportion to\r\nthe size of the tree. This year's crop consisted of 88 clusters of nuts,\r\nwith an average nut count of 10.2 nuts per cluster, giving a total of\r\nalmost 900 nuts on this 7-year-old tree.\r\n\r\nThere is one more figure I'd like to give you. The count of clusters\r\ncompared to the number of terminals we had this spring is better than 90\r\nper cent clusters. I have a few bud sticks here cut from green water\r\nsprouts. That's the only kind I can find a sprout on. I brought them up\r\nto Mr. McDaniel. If anybody can talk Mr. McDaniel out of a bud he wanted\r\nto try, but I don't really know what plans he had for these bud sticks.\r\nThe 7 or 8 other varieties of heartnuts I have growing don't have any\r\nthat have clusters like the Rhodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScab Disease in Eastern Kentucky on the Busseron Pecan\r\n\r\nW. D. ARMSTRONG, _University of Kentucky, Princeton, Kentucky_\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. ARMSTRONG: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: It is nice to be here\r\nat the Northern Nut Growers meeting. This is my second session. I attend\r\nall the pecan and nut sessions in the country. I have attended\r\nGeorgia-Florida Pecan Growers Association and Oklahoma and Texas Pecan\r\nGrowers Association.\r\n\r\nThese plates that I have contain some of the Busseron pecans affected\r\nwith pecan scab. The disease has shown up in Southeastern Kentucky,\r\nabout a hundred miles southeast of Lexington, a hundred miles west of\r\nthe Virginia line, and about a hundred miles north of the Tennessee\r\nline, on a straight line west of Roanoke, Virginia.\r\n\r\nThese trees were planted in bottom soil, rather well drained, and they\r\nmade a rapid growth. In the original planting there were two Green River\r\npecans, one Major, one Busseron and two walnuts, a Stabler and a Thomas.\r\n\r\nAbout 1946 we noticed that all of the pecans on the Busseron were like\r\nthese that we have here--did not mature, completely covered with scab\r\nfungus and dropped off the tree. The shells were so thin that you could\r\njust crush the whole pecan, hull, shell and all with no meats in them.\r\nThe Major tree right beside it and the two Green River trees had none of\r\nthis trouble, and they have none of it as yet. And each year now that\r\nthis Busseron tree has borne there, practically all of the nuts have\r\nbeen like this.\r\n\r\nAt the time we located this disease first in 1946, I sent samples to the\r\nU.S.D.A. at Washington and also to the Southeastern Pecan Laboratory at\r\nAlbany, Georgia, and Dr. Cole, there identified it as pecan scab.\r\n\r\nI reported the presence of the disease to Mr. Wilkinson and to Dr. Colby\r\nand they were surprised to see the disease on Busseron in any location,\r\nand particularly that far north.\r\n\r\nIn the south this disease frequently affects Schley, Delmas, Alley and\r\nVan Deman and some others. Formerly the trees were sprayed with Bordeaux\r\nMixture. I think they are using Zerlate now. It's a problem to be\r\nreckoned with. It occurs on the nuts and on the leaves, and it is\r\ncarried over winter on the stems and the one-year shoots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther News About Oak Wilt\r\n\r\nE. A. CURL, _Illinois Natural History Survey, Urbana, Ill._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1951 a review of the oak wilt situation was given in a paper,\r\n\"Present Status of the Oak Wilt Disease\", at the Forty-Second Annual\r\nMeeting of the N.N.G.A. at the University of Illinois. The following\r\nreport is aimed at bringing up to date the present known distribution\r\nof the oak wilt disease, recent developments in scientific research on\r\nthe disease, and possible control measures.\r\n\r\nThe oak wilt disease is caused by the fungus _Chalara quercina_ Henry\r\nand is characterized by a very noticeable bronzing and wilting of leaves\r\nthat drop prematurely. Brown streaks are usually present in the outer\r\nsapwood. These symptoms may be seen from June to September or until\r\nnormal autumn colors of the foliage develop.\r\n\r\nMore than 30 species of oak are known to be susceptible to the disease.\r\nOther susceptible genera of the family Fagaceae are Chinese chestnut,\r\n_Castanea mollissima_, golden chinquapin, _Castanopsis chrysophylla_,\r\ntanbark oak, _Lithocarpus densifiora_, and _Nothofagus_ from South\r\nAmerica. The red and black oaks seem to be most susceptible and are\r\noften killed within 6 weeks after infection.\r\n\r\n\r\nDistribution\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years the oak wilt disease has spread with such\r\nrapidity and destructiveness among valuable forest and shade oaks in\r\nparts of the eastern half of the United States that its seriousness is\r\nnow well recognized. At present oak wilt is known to be in the following\r\nstates: Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana,\r\nnorthern Arkansas, eastern Kansas, southeastern Nebraska, Ohio,\r\nPennsylvania, West Virginia, northwestern Virginia, western part of\r\nNorth Carolina, eastern Tennessee, northeastern Kentucky, western\r\nMaryland and southern Michigan. Aerial surveys for 1952 are not yet\r\ncomplete, but there are indications of extensive new infections in\r\nPennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia while the other states show a\r\nmoderate increase in the number of infections.\r\n\r\nThe first case of oak wilt in Illinois was seen in Rockford in 1942.\r\nToday 54 of the 102 counties in the state have oak wilt areas. The\r\ndisease is present in both the extreme northern part and the\r\nsouthern-most tip of the state. Practically all wilt areas in the\r\nsouthern half of Illinois consist of 5 trees or less that appear to have\r\ndied within the last 4 years, indicating a recent spread of the disease\r\nsouthward. A similar condition exists in southern Missouri and northern\r\nArkansas.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopments in Research\r\n\r\nIn 1942 a report from the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station\r\nrevealed that the oak wilt disease was caused by a fungus, and research\r\nprograms were started early in Wisconsin and Iowa. Neighboring states\r\nwere quick to follow as surveys showed a wider distribution of the\r\ndisease. Now almost every state in which oak wilt occurs is taking part\r\nin efforts to learn more about the disease and its causal agent so that\r\npractical control measures may be applied before the spread of the\r\ndisease gets out of hand. The National Oak Wilt Research Committee at\r\nMemphis, Tennessee, supports in part an intensive oak wilt research\r\nprogram in coordination with several midwestern universities and with\r\nthe U.S.D.A., Bureau of Forest Pathology.\r\n\r\nUntil recently the causal fungus of oak wilt was known only in its\r\nasexual or imperfect form living in the sap stream of infected trees.\r\nThe most important question to be answered now is how the fungus\r\nspreads over long distances from diseased to healthy trees. Before this\r\ncould be accomplished, however, we had to know how the fungus escapes\r\nfrom the inside to the outside of diseased trees where it can be exposed\r\nto agents of dissemination.\r\n\r\nIn the late summer of 1951 clearly visible mycelial mats of the oak wilt\r\nfungus were found in Illinois under the loose bark of wilt-killed trees.\r\nThese mats were usually located beneath cracks in the bark; thus, they\r\nwere exposed to the outside air and to visiting insects. Most\r\nwilt-killed trees contain beneath the bark numerous insect larvae of\r\nwood and bark boring beetles. Larvae were frequently found in direct\r\ncontact with mycelial mats of the fungus. Larvae of the two-lined\r\nchestnut borer, _Agrilus bilineatus_, were most abundant, but larvae of\r\nspecies of the families Scolytidae and Cerambycidae were also present in\r\nlarge numbers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the mycelial mat under the bark there was often present a\r\nthick dark pad usually in the center of the mat. It is not known yet\r\nwhat part this pad plays in the life history of the fungus but we do\r\nknow that it is produced by the same fungus which causes oak wilt.\r\n\r\nWe also found in Illinois that the oak wilt fungus often develops into\r\nvisible mats from chips of bark and wood that have been chopped from\r\nwilt-killed trees and allowed to lie on the moist forest floor. This\r\nshould be remembered when considering sanitation as a partial means of\r\ncontrolling the disease.\r\n\r\nIn 1951 the sexual or perfect form of the oak wilt fungus was produced\r\non laboratory media in Missouri by crossing different strains of the\r\nfungus. The sexual form is recognized by the appearance of microscopic,\r\nblack, short-beaked fruiting structures or perithecia that are filled\r\nwith sticky ascospores. This sexual form is a species of\r\n_Endoconidiophora_.\r\n\r\nThe sexual form of the fungus was first found in nature in Illinois in\r\nthe autumn of 1951. The perithecia are produced on the mycelial mats\r\nbeneath the loose and sometimes cracked bark of diseased oaks. Both the\r\nascospores of the sexual form and the endospores or conidia of the\r\nasexual form will cause wilt if the spores are injected into oak trees.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing information it is apparent that several methods by\r\nwhich the disease might be spread over long distances are possible.\r\nFirst, and what seems to be most probable, is transmission by insects.\r\nAdult beetles, such as the two-lined chestnut borer, which emerge from\r\ndead trees in the spring and feed on the leaves of healthy trees might\r\ntransmit the spores of the fungus. Other insects might feed on the\r\nfungus mats that are exposed through cracks in the bark and carry both\r\nthe sticky ascospores and conidia to other trees. Additional agents that\r\nmust be considered are woodpeckers, squirrels and air currents.\r\n\r\nBesides searching for the vector or vectors that spread the disease\r\nother important studies are in progress. Among these is the\r\nconsideration of chemotherapy as a possible means of controlling oak\r\nwilt. For our purpose, plant chemotherapy may be defined as the control\r\nof disease by chemicals which are introduced into the plant. According\r\nto Dr. Paul Hoffman of the Illinois Natural History Survey, a number of\r\nchemicals have shown promise in curing small diseased oak trees when\r\ntreated in a very early stage of the disease. In one instance, trees\r\nthat were inoculated with the oak wilt fungus then treated with\r\nchemicals 2 years ago are still alive. The most promising results were\r\nobtained by injecting the chemicals into the soil where they are taken\r\nup by the roots and by applying chemicals directly to the foliage in a\r\nspray. Trunk injection showed least promise because of the limited\r\ndistribution of the chemicals through the tree.\r\n\r\nThe use of chemicals for curing wilt-infected trees is still in the\r\nearly experimental stage and is not yet recommended as a practical\r\ncontrol measure.\r\n\r\nIn 1949 Wisconsin workers demonstrated the local spread of oak wilt\r\nthrough natural root grafts. They found that the poisoning of a single\r\nhealthy tree with sodium arsenite often killed as many as 15 other trees\r\nnearby, indicating that their roots were connected.\r\n\r\nRecently the results of experiments in Wisconsin explained in part what\r\ncauses the leaves of diseased trees to wilt. When a tree becomes\r\ninfected it is stimulated to produce tyloses or swellings in the vessels\r\nof the wood. Therefore, the flow of water from the roots to the tree top\r\nis restricted and the leaves wilt and die. It is also known that the\r\nfungus itself produces a toxin which might be responsible for the actual\r\nkilling effect on the tree.\r\n\r\nIn Illinois experiments are being conducted with insects in relation to\r\nthe spread of oak wilt. Insects of various species are collected from\r\nwilt-killed trees and allowed to run over or feed on laboratory cultures\r\nof the oak wilt fungus. The insects are then caged on parts of healthy\r\ntrees to feed on the leaves. A single red oak treated in this way\r\ncontracted the disease and died. This shows that the disease can be\r\ntransmitted by an insect.\r\n\r\n\r\nControlling the Disease\r\n\r\nThe spread of oak wilt in local areas may be stopped by preventing the\r\nunderground movement of the disease from tree to tree through natural\r\nroot grafts. This can be done by (1) poisoning all healthy trees within\r\n50 feet of diseased trees, (2) cutting a ditch 30 inches deep with a\r\nsmall trenching machine between diseased and healthy trees to sever root\r\nconnections or (3) severing root connections with a tractor drawn plow\r\non which a knife blade is attached. Unfortunately the use of such heavy\r\nequipment is not practical in rocky and hilly areas. Chemicals used for\r\nkilling trees are sodium arsenite and ammate. Ammate is safe to use but\r\ndoes not kill trees as rapidly as the other poison. In some localities\r\n2,4,5-T used as a trunk spray has given satisfactory results in killing\r\nsmall trees.\r\n\r\nIf infected trees are left standing mycelial mats with their numerous\r\nspores develop under the loosening bark. It is therefore advisable to\r\ncut and burn all parts of diseased trees as soon as possible after\r\nsymptoms appear.\r\n\r\nA combination trenching and eradication program was started in the\r\nsummer of 1950 in the Forest Preserve District of Cook County in\r\nIllinois. According to Mr. Noel B. Wysong, Chief Forester, 2 newly\r\nwilted trees were found in the Forest Preserve in 1948, 72 trees in\r\n1949, 141 trees in 1950, and 96 trees in 1951. The count for 1952 is not\r\ncomplete but a continued decrease in the number of new infections would\r\nindicate good control.\r\n\r\nThere is no information on resistant species of oak. In very rare cases,\r\nhowever, trees have been observed to recover after showing symptoms in\r\nthe early spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Outlook\r\n\r\nAmong the many things that we need to know yet about the oak wilt\r\ndisease and its causal fungus one is outstanding. How does the disease\r\njump from one infection center to healthy trees 200 yards, 2 miles or\r\neven 100 miles away? Although spread through root grafts may be\r\ncontrolled by severing root connections, the value of such a control\r\nmeasure is limited as long as the agent or agents responsible for long\r\ndistance spread remain unknown. The discovery of other methods of spread\r\nmight result in the development of control measures that are cheaper and\r\nless drastic than those known at present.\r\n\r\nA great deal remains to be done and research is increasing in the\r\nvarious states concerned. There is reason to believe that oak wilt can\r\nbe checked before it reaches devastating proportions comparable to\r\nchestnut blight which wiped out our American chestnuts.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: What is the origin of the fungus? Is it a native fungus, or\r\nimported?\r\n\r\nMR. CURL: Yes, it is a native fungus, as far as we know.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: Any evidence that the fungus is mutating to make more\r\nvirulent strains?\r\n\r\nMR. CURL: That's something that hasn't been found yet. There are several\r\nstrains of the fungus, what we call strains, because they will form the\r\nsexual stage, and a strain alone will not. There is not too much known\r\nabout that yet, the strain business.\r\n\r\nMR. GRAVATT: Just a word. We had a conference in Beltsville all day\r\nSunday about the recent developments on the oak wilt. There has been\r\nvery extensive spread in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and Maryland\r\nthis year. We are very much alarmed about the situation. The Chinese\r\nchestnut is very severely affected. We have learned that in Missouri.\r\nOne year there were three Chinese chestnuts killed by the fungus, the\r\nnext year 60. The oak wilt is a serious threat to the chestnut orchards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLife History and Control of the Pecan Spittle Bug\r\n\r\nSTEWART CHANDLER, _Associate Entomologist, Ill. Nat. History Survey,\r\nUrbana, Ill., Consulting Entomologist, Southern Illinois University_\r\n\r\n\r\nSince it was a year ago that this subject of spittle bug was first\r\nbrought to the attention of the Northern Nut Growers Association, it\r\nmight be well to review briefly the high lights of that report. I told\r\nyou at the annual meeting at Urbana, something of the life history.\r\nThere are two broods, one appearing in June and one in July. The adult\r\nis a small sucking bug about an eighth to a quarter inch long. The\r\nspecies at that time was uncertain but now has been determined by\r\nspecialists in that group as _Cercoptera achatina_ Germ. This insect, I\r\nreported, is not the same as the one occurring on meadow and other\r\nfield crops, not only the species but the genus being different. The\r\ndistribution was found to be in every area where pecans are grown. As to\r\nits importance I pointed out that in Illinois it had become very serious\r\nin the past three or four years, apparently causing a marked reduction\r\nin crop. Control measures were directed against the nymphal stage, which\r\nis protected by the spittle which the insect emits continuously while\r\nfeeding. Three insecticides were tested at Anna, Illinois, Lindane,\r\nparathion, and tetra ethyl pyro phosphate, known as TEPP. Lindane proved\r\nto be approximately 95% efficient, parathion roughly 60% and TEPP about\r\n10%.\r\n\r\nIn 1952 the work was resumed in the orchard of Conrad Casper near Anna,\r\nIllinois and was begun at the Richard Best place at Eldred, 175 miles\r\nnorthwest.\r\n\r\nIn 1952 five phases of the work with pecan spittle bug were undertaken\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n   1. A study of the importance of the pecan spittle bug.\r\n   2. The hibernation of the insect.\r\n   3. Life history and occurrence of the various stages and broods of\r\n      the insect in relation to nut development of the pecan.\r\n   4. Control measures.\r\n   5. Varietal susceptibility to the insect.\r\n\r\n1. Importance of the insect\r\n\r\n_Hibernation Studies_\r\n\r\nTo learn to what extent if any the insect reduces the crop of pecans,\r\nterminal shoots from trees sprayed the previous season with three\r\ndifferent materials were compared with the unsprayed check. These are\r\nshown in Table 1.\r\n\r\nTable 1. Pecan spittle bug effect of 1951 sprays on terminal shoots in\r\nspring of 1952\r\n\r\n   ===================================================\r\n                                         Dead shoots\r\n                        Treatment        per hundred\r\n\r\n         Check                              87\r\n         TEPP                               62\r\n         Parathion                          17\r\n         Lindane                             4\r\n   ===================================================\r\n\r\nSince these terminals shoots later develop most of the nuts it would\r\nappear that the pecan spittle bug is responsible for much of the loss of\r\ncrop under these heavy infestations.\r\n\r\nIt was planned to follow this up with later examination of nuts, and\r\nthis was done with the assistance of Mr. J. C. McDaniel, but\r\nunfortunately it was found that this was the off year and the crop was\r\nvery small, so we could not definitely settle that point. This will be a\r\njob for the future.\r\n\r\n2. Hibernation studies.\r\n\r\nIn August of 1951, I introduced adult bugs into a cage placed over a\r\nbranch of an unsprayed pecan tree for the purpose of determining whether\r\nthere was possibly a third brood. Finding none the branch was removed\r\nand examined to study the hibernating eggs and the egg slits in which\r\nthey were layed. The slits were not over a quarter inch long and\r\nfrequently in pairs. Eggs were deep enough that they were rarely seen\r\nwithout opening the slits. Many slits were found containing egg shells,\r\npresumably from the previous brood, but possibly from a season earlier\r\nas the slits are corked over.\r\n\r\nFollowing this study branches were cut from the sprayed and unsprayed\r\nblocks and gone over very carefully to find the numbers and location of\r\nthe egg splits and the numbers containing live eggs and egg shells. Each\r\nsplit would contain as many as 5 or 6 eggs. Table 2 show their numbers\r\nand locations, and Table 3 the effect of sprays on numbers of live eggs.\r\n\r\nTable 2.

Life history and correlation of stages of insect and nut development.\r\n\r\nIt was soon found that the pecan spittle bug was putting in its\r\nappearance earlier according to the calendar than in 1951 so an effort\r\nwas made during the season to correlate insect life history and nut\r\ndevelopment during the season. Table 4 give some of the principal points\r\nin both.\r\n\r\nTable 4. Pecan Spittle Bug and Nut Development Anna, Illinois, 1952\r\n\r\n   --------------------------------------------------------------\r\n         Insect              Date              Tree\r\n   --------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   Egg stage                Apr. 24     Catkins 1/2 to 3/4 inch\r\n   First nymphs             May 5       Catkins 1 to 1-1/2 inch\r\n   Many nymphs and spittle  May 12      Catkins 2 to 3 inches\r\n                                          Fruit buds\r\n   Peak hatch               May 20      Female flowers\r\n   Spittle drying           June 2      Nuts developing\r\n   1st. 2nd brood           June 27\r\n   Hatch mostly over        July 7\r\n   Spittle drying           July 26\r\n   --------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAnother phase of life history which is of practical importance is the\r\nincrease of second brood over first. Records were made both at Anna and\r\nat Eldred in unsprayed blocks at approximately the peaks of occurrence\r\nof nymphs and spittle, and are tabulated in Table 5.\r\n\r\nTable 5. Pecan Spittle Bug Infestation, first and second broods, 1952\r\nNumber of spittle masses per 100 terminals\r\n\r\n   ==========================================================\r\n                  First brood, June     Second brood, July\r\n   ----------------------------------------------------------\r\n   Anna                41                     62\r\n   Eldred              23                     50\r\n   ----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis table shows an increase of approximately 50% at Anna and 100% at\r\nEldred. It is thought that a 3 inch flash flood which occurred at Anna\r\nmight have reduced the first brood infestation somewhat after the counts\r\nwere made and been responsible for no greater increase and possibly that\r\nthe heat and drought in both places might have resulted in a reduction.\r\nBe that as it may the total infestation was not as severe in 1952 as in\r\n1951.\r\n\r\n4. Control.\r\n\r\n_First Brood Sprays_\r\n\r\nIt was originally planned to spray in both places but at Anna the owner\r\nsprayed all but the 1951 check block with parathion early and the\r\ninfestation was reduced to the point where later hatch did not build up\r\nto a sufficient point that good results could be observed so no spraying\r\nwas done at Anna till the second brood. At Eldred two materials only\r\nwere available, Lindane and Dieldrin.\r\n\r\nAt Eldred we had two difficulties in spraying. One was the type of\r\nmachine with which I was not familiar and the other the inaccessibility\r\nof some of the trees. The machine is probably more fitted for field crop\r\nwork than for large trees. It is called a Mechanical Aresol Generator,\r\nmanufactured by the Hessian Microsol Corporation of Darien, Conn. The\r\nengine is a Wisconsin Air cooled motor made in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The\r\nmachine was mounted on a platform and transported in the orchard on a\r\ntruck. Two fifty gallon barrels constitute the tank. Due to the nature\r\nof the machine and to lack of agitation only liquid materials can be\r\nused in it. It uses a much smaller amount of material than I had been\r\naccustomed to, and my first job was to learn to what extent the\r\nmaterials must be concentrated to compensate for the small output and\r\nhow to get a comparison with the amounts used in regular orchard\r\nsprayer. In concentrate tests on fruit trees we arrive at this by\r\njudging the number of gallons which a tree would normally receive with a\r\nstandard sprayer. There was little background to go on with nut trees\r\nand the problem was further complicated by the arrangement of trees\r\nwhich were not planted but grafted in their original positions in the\r\nwoods. A clump of trees which could not be approached individually might\r\nhave to receive not much more material than one tree which could be hit\r\nfrom both sides. Sizes of trees also varied. It was decided to use only\r\n25 gallon lots of material and even this small amount sprayed from 55\r\nto 65 trees of varying sizes. It was soon seen that the tops of the\r\nmoderate and large sized trees were not covered very well. For the first\r\nbrood sprays at Eldred about six times as much material per 100 gallons\r\nwas used as had been successful at Anna the previous season. The results\r\nare shown in Table 6.\r\n\r\nTable 6. Spittle Bug Control, Eldred, 1952 First brood, sprayed May 23,\r\nexamined June 9\r\n\r\n   =========================================================\r\n         Treatment       Amount in         Spittle masses\r\n                        100 gallons        800 terminals\r\n   ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n   Dieldrin            1 gal. of 18-1/2%       18\r\n   Lindane             1 gal. of 20%           27\r\n   Check                ------                189\r\n   ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the reduction over the unsprayed blocks was about\r\n90% with Dieldrin and 85% with Lindane.\r\n\r\nFor second brood sprays at Eldred materials were increased to about 8\r\ntimes normal in hopes of getting better results. In this test 10 trees\r\nwere selected in each block that could be reached moderately well and\r\nsprayed separately before the entire block was sprayed. Records were\r\nmade the day before spraying, 3 days after spraying, and 10 days after\r\nspraying. Four materials were available, making five blocks with an\r\nunsprayed check. The results of these sprayings are given in Table 7.\r\n\r\nTable 7. Spittle Bug Control, Eldred, 1952 Second brood, sprayed July 18\r\n\r\n   ============================================================\r\n     Treatment      Amounts in            In 200 terminals\r\n                   100 gallons       July 17  July 21  July 28\r\n   ------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   Lindane       6 qts. of 20%          123      24       2\r\n   BHC          10 qts. of 11.7%         98      11       0\r\n   Dieldrin      6 qts. of 18-1/2%      130      19       9\r\n   Toxaphene     8 qts. of 58%          107      16       3\r\n   Check           ------                99      98      47\r\n   ------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDue to the natural reduction in the check by July 28 most attention\r\nprobably should be given to the July 21 examination. This table shows\r\napproximately 92% reduction from Lindane, 87% with BHC, 85% from\r\nDieldrin, and 85% from Toxaphene on July 21.\r\n\r\nAt Anna trees are all very big, from 50 to 75 feet high. They are\r\nplanted in rows. A regular orchard sprayer was used with 600 pounds\r\npressure using one gun and sprayed from the top of the rig.\r\nApproximately 25 gallons was used per tree. As will be noted the dosage\r\nwas much smaller than at Eldred, and for ordinary use these are probably\r\nthe proper dosages. Table 8 gives the results of these tests.\r\n\r\nTable 8. Pecan Spittle Bug Control, Anna, 1952\r\n\r\n   ==================================================================\r\n     Treatment      Amounts in                In 200 terminals\r\n                   100 gallons             July 10  July 14  July 22\r\n   ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   Lindane        1 lb. of 25%                214      1       1\r\n   BHC            2-1/2 lbs. of 10%           244      5       9\r\n   Dieldrin       1 and 1/3 pints of 18-1/2%  148      3       5\r\n   Toxaphene      1 qt. of 31%                146     22      21\r\n   Check                                       61     47      20\r\n   -------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe reduction in the check block July 14 may be due to proximity to the\r\nsprayed block which was not true in Eldred. This check was small. Table\r\n8 shows on July 14 an approximate reduction of Lindane 99%, BHC 98%,\r\nDieldrin 98%, and Toxaphene 85%.\r\n\r\nFrom these tests in both places it appears that we have a choice of\r\nthree very good materials, Lindane, Benzene hexachloride called BHC and\r\nDieldrin, and for that reason we can ignore the less efficient material,\r\ntoxaphene.\r\n\r\nAt Eldred, since first brood sprays were applied in a sizeable area\r\nrecords of infestation were made shortly before time to spray for the\r\nsecond brood to determine whether the first brood spraying would\r\neliminate the need for second brood spraying. However, the infestation\r\nwas found to be practically as great in this area as the unsprayed part\r\nof the woods. It appears that the control was not good enough to allow\r\nthis. In part this was due to failure to reach the tops of the trees.\r\nRecords were made in the lower parts.\r\n\r\n5. Varietal susceptibility.\r\n\r\nAt Anna where there was a limited number of trees, the orchards were\r\nplotted on paper and location of each tree with variety indicated\r\nrecords were made of each tree separately, in hopes that some varietal\r\nsusceptibility would be shown. There is nothing very clear in this\r\nrespect except that of the varieties in the Casper orchard, Butterick,\r\nBusseron, Indiana, Posey, Stewart, Osburn, Major, Green River, the\r\nIndiana and Posey may be a little more heavily infested than the others.\r\nAt Eldred for the second brood infestation, the variety of each of the\r\n10 record trees was reported, but there were so many varieties and they\r\ndid not occur often enough in the five plots to make variety infestation\r\ndata reliable. However, the rather high average on the Indiana variety\r\ndid seem to corroborate the findings at Anna.\r\n\r\nThere was some foliage burn in two of the record trees in the Dieldrin\r\nplot at Eldred, both being the variety Rockville. Another tree in\r\nanother part of the plot was also found to be burned and also found to\r\nbe the same variety, so it appears that this may be particularly\r\nsusceptible to spraying especially in this concentrated form such as we\r\nused. There were no Rockville trees in any of the other plots, so we\r\nhave no way of knowing whether the Lindane, BHC or Toxaphene would have\r\ndone the same or not.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: The next paper, the last paper of the afternoon,\r\nis Control of Insects Injuring Nut Trees, by Howard Baker, U.S.D.A.\r\nBureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, Beltsville, Md.\r\n\r\nMR. BAKER: Mr. Chairman, members of the Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation: It is a great deal of pleasure to be back here speaking\r\nbefore a group of nut growers. Back some years ago my first assignment\r\nto a station of which I had charge was an investigation to count insects\r\nin Louisiana and Eastern Texas, so it is a pleasure to be back before a\r\ngroup of nut growers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInsect Enemies of Northern Tree Nuts\r\n\r\nHOWARD BAKER, _U.S.D.A., Agr. Res. Admin., Bureau of Entomology and\r\nPlant Quarantine_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe small number of requests for information on insect pests of northern\r\ntree nuts received in the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine is a\r\nstrong indication that such pests are of little concern to northern nut\r\ngrowers. This is fortunate, because intensive, all-season spray\r\nprograms, such as are necessary to produce most other crops without\r\nserious losses due to insect injury, are laborious and expensive and not\r\nalways as effective as desired. However, as your acreage is increased\r\nand as your trees become older and larger, insect problems are likely to\r\nincrease in number and intensity and require more of your thought and\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar situation prevailed in the pecan industry at one time\r\nin the South. I well remember the statement of one of the larger pecan\r\ngrowers in Louisiana to the effect that all the pleasure of growing\r\npecans would be gone the day he had to start spraying to control insects\r\nand diseases. Only a short time later it became necessary for him to\r\ninitiate a regular spray program. He still took great pride in growing\r\npecans, however. It is well, therefore, for you to watch your trees\r\nclosely for insect damage and keep informed concerning the habits and\r\ncontrol of the species that show up in your plantings or in those of\r\nyour neighbors.\r\n\r\nBecause of the scattered nature of the northern nut industry, the small\r\nsize of most plantings, and the more pressing demands for information on\r\nthe control of pests of more intensively planted crops, it has not been\r\npossible for the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine to give\r\nattention to many of the pests of northern nuts. A great deal of work\r\nhas been done on the pests of pecans in the South, and some work on\r\nthose that attack filberts and chestnuts. In addition, some of the pests\r\nwith which you are concerned, or others similar to them, are receiving\r\nattention in connection with studies of pests of tree fruits. The\r\nresults of these studies will give you up-to-date information applicable\r\nto your particular problems.\r\n\r\nThe timely use of insecticides is the most effective means of combating\r\nmost injurious insects, but if spraying is not possible, other methods\r\ncan often be used to prevent or reduce damage. A great many new\r\ninsecticides have become available during the last six or seven years.\r\nWork with them has resulted in the development of treatments effective\r\nagainst a number of pests for which there was formerly no known means of\r\ncontrol and markedly more effective treatments for the control of\r\nothers. It is my purpose to bring to you as much of this new information\r\nas is applicable to your problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaf-feeding Caterpillars\r\n\r\nThe fall webworm[3] and the walnut caterpillar[4] are the leaf-feeding\r\ncaterpillars most commonly reported as attacking northern tree nuts.\r\n\r\nFall webworms[5] are the insects usually responsible for unsightly webs\r\non or near the end of the branches of the trees during the summer and\r\nfall. They enlarge the webs as they need more leaves. When nearly full\r\ngrown they scatter to complete their feeding. The full-grown\r\ncaterpillars are a little more than an inch in length and are covered\r\nwith long black and white hairs. They spend the winter in cocoons in\r\ntrash on the ground or just below the surface of the soil. There are two\r\nbroods a year in many areas, the second usually being the more numerous.\r\n\r\nControl can be obtained by applying a spray containing 3 pounds of lead\r\narsenate with an equal quantity of hydrated lime (to prevent possible\r\ninjury to the foliage), 2 pounds of 50-percent DDT wettable powder, or 2\r\npounds of 15-percent parathion wettable powder per 100 gallons of water.\r\nApply the spray when the caterpillars are still small. Follow the\r\nprecautions furnished with each package. Parathion is a particularly\r\ndangerous material to use. If you are not equipped to spray or have only\r\na few trees, you can control this insect by removing the webs from the\r\ntrees with a long-handled pruner or a long bamboo pole with a hook at\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nThe walnut caterpillar feeds in groups, or colonies, and commonly eats\r\nall the leaves on small trees or on certain limbs on large trees. The\r\nwinter is spent in cocoons in the ground. The moths appear late in the\r\nspring or early in the summer and lay masses of eggs on the underside of\r\nthe leaves. From time to time as they grow, the stout, black\r\ncaterpillars go down to a large limb or to the trunk of the tree to\r\nmolt, or shed their skins. After molting they return toward the ends of\r\nthe branches and resume their feeding.\r\n\r\nThis insect can be controlled with the same spray treatments that are\r\nrecommended for the fall webworm, and also by crushing or burning the\r\ncaterpillars when they are clustered on the lower limbs or tree trunks.\r\n\r\n\r\nPecan Phylloxera[6]\r\n\r\nSwellings called galls sometimes appear on leaves, leafstalks, succulent\r\nshoots, or nuts of the current season's growth of hickory and pecan.\r\nThese galls are caused by small insects known as phylloxera, which are\r\nclosely related to aphids, or plant lice. Several species are involved,\r\nbut only one, known as the pecan phylloxera, causes serious damage. It\r\ncauses twigs to become malformed, weakened and finally to die, and\r\ndestroys the crop on the infested terminals. The insect passes the\r\nwinter in the egg stage in protected places on the trees. The young\r\nappear in the spring about the time the buds begin to unfold.\r\n\r\nThe phylloxera can be controlled by spraying the trees thoroughly with a\r\nmixture containing 3/4 pint of nicotine sulfate plus 2-1/2 gallons of\r\nlime-sulfur or 2 quarts of lubricating-oil emulsion to 100 gallons of\r\nwater during the delayed dormant period or by the time buds show about\r\nan inch of green. Sprays containing 3 pounds of BHC (10-percent gamma)\r\nor 1-1/4 pounds of 25-percent lindane wettable powder per 100 gallons\r\nare also effective, and their use is increasing. Other materials have\r\ngiven good control when applied about the time the buds begin to swell.\r\nThey are 36-percent dinitro-o-sec-butylphenol liquid, 3 quarts per 100\r\ngallons, and a mixture of 40-percent dinitro-o-cyclohexylphenol powder,\r\n2 pounds, and lubricating-oil emulsion, 5 quarts, per 100 gallons of\r\nspray. Do not use the dinitro materials after the buds begin to open.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwig Girdler\r\n\r\nA stout, brown beetle about 1/2 inch in length, known as the twig\r\ngirdler,[7] often cuts off the twigs of hickory, pecan, and many other\r\ntrees in the late summer and early fall. The larvae spend the winter in\r\nthe cut twigs, which are gradually broken off and fall to the ground.\r\nInjury can be reduced by collecting and destroying the fallen twigs\r\nbefore the larvae complete development the following spring. Recent work\r\non pecans in Florida indicates that most injury can be prevented by\r\napplying a spray containing 4 pounds of 50-percent DDT or 3 pounds of\r\n15-percent parathion wettable powder per 100 gallons of water. Three\r\napplications appear to be necessary, the first when the injured branches\r\nare first noticed, usually sometime in August, and the second and third\r\ntwo and four weeks later. When handling parathion be sure to follow the\r\nprecautions on the package.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeevils and Curculios\r\n\r\nWeevils and curculios are small, hard-shelled, grayish to brown beetles\r\nabout 1/4 to 1/2 inch long, with stiff, slender snouts or beaks. They\r\nfeed and lay eggs in the nuts and/or shoots of many kinds of nuts,\r\nincluding hickory, walnut, pecan, chestnut, hazelnut or filbert, and\r\nbutternut. There are a number of species, but most of them attack only\r\none kind of nut. The species usually called weevils most often lay eggs\r\nand injure the nuts from the time the meat begins to form until it is\r\nmature, whereas the group known as curculios generally emerge and cause\r\nmost serious damage during the early part of the growing season, when\r\nthe new shoots are developing and the crop starts to set and grow.\r\n\r\nThe chestnut weevils are probably the weevils best known to most of you.\r\nE. R. VanLeeuwen, of the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, has\r\nadded much to our knowledge of these weevils in recent years. Two\r\nspecies, the small chestnut weevil[8] and the large chestnut weevil,[9]\r\nare commonly present together and cause similar injury. The small\r\nchestnut weevil appears as an adult over a period of about 6 weeks\r\nbeginning near the first of May in the vicinity of Beltsville, Md., but\r\nit does not lay eggs until about the middle of August. The larger\r\nspecies does not emerge until about the middle of August and begins to\r\nlay eggs soon thereafter. Eggs are laid in the developing nuts, and\r\ninjury is caused by the feeding of the larvae therein. Most of the small\r\nweevils require two years to complete development, and most of the\r\nlarger weevils but one year.\r\n\r\nSome control of these weevils can be obtained by collecting and\r\ndestroying the infested nuts before the larvae leave them to enter the\r\nsoil. Better control can be obtained by spraying the trees with DDT.\r\nApply a spray containing 4 pounds of 50-percent DDT wettable powder per\r\n100 gallons of water (3 level tablespoonfuls per gallon) 30 days before\r\nthe first mature nuts are expected to drop, and make two additional\r\napplications at intervals of 7 days. If you are not equipped to spray,\r\nyou may obtain some control by treating the soil under the trees with\r\nethylene dibromide at a depth of 5 inches. Make injections at intervals\r\nof 1 foot in each direction and also in the center of each square formed\r\nby these injection holes. Place 1 milliliter of 40-percent ethylene\r\ndibromide or an equivalent quantity of another dilution in each hole.\r\nMake the application in the fall immediately after the nuts are\r\nharvested and close the injection holes by pressing with the foot. The\r\nsoil should preferably be loose to a depth of 5 inches.\r\n\r\nThe pecan weevil,[10] also known as the hickory nut weevil, often causes\r\nheavy losses of pecans and most species of hickory. Two or three years\r\nare required for the insect to complete its life cycle, but some\r\nspecimens reach maturity every year. Adults emerge from the ground from\r\nthe middle of July until early in September, according to locality and\r\nseasonal conditions. Injury is of two types--(1) that resulting from\r\nattack before the shell-hardening period in July and August, causing the\r\nyoung nuts to drop, and (2) that resulting from attack after kernel\r\nformation, the kernel being destroyed by the developing larvae, or\r\ngrubs. Egg deposition in the nuts usually begins late in August.\r\n\r\nTo control this weevil spray the trees twice with 6 pounds of 50-percent\r\nDDT or 40-percent toxaphene wettable powder per 100 gallons of water.\r\nMake the first application when at least six weevils can be jarred onto\r\na sheet on the ground beneath any tree known to have been infested in\r\nprevious seasons, and make the second 10 to 14 days later. The first\r\napplication will be needed sometime between the last week in July and\r\nthe first week in September. If the soil is hard and dry, it will delay\r\nemergence of the weevils. If you are not equipped to spray, you can\r\nreduce weevil injury about 50 percent by jarring the limbs of the trees\r\nlightly and gathering the weevils on a sheet during the period of\r\nemergence. The dislodged weevils will remain quiet on the sheet long\r\nenough to be picked up and destroyed. Begin jarring about the last week\r\nin July and confine it to two or three trees until the first weevils\r\nappear. Then jar all trees at weekly intervals until about the middle of\r\nSeptember, when egg laying will have been largely completed.\r\n\r\nThe butternut curculio[11] attacks native butternuts and introduced nuts\r\nof a similar type. It passes the winter as an adult in trash or other\r\nshelter it can find in the vicinity of nut trees. It is a small,\r\nhard-shelled, rough-backed snout beetle. Late in the spring it makes its\r\nway to the trees, and lays eggs in the young shoots. On hatching, the\r\nyoung larva penetrates into the young shoot or leaf stem or nut and\r\nfeeds there, causing the leaf or nut to dry up and fall off. Upon\r\ncompleting development in the fallen leaf or nut, the mature larva\r\nenters the soil. After a month or so in the ground the adult emerges,\r\nfeeds on the foliage for a while, and then enters hibernation. There is\r\nbut one generation a year.\r\n\r\nThe black walnut curculio[12] is similar to the butternut curculio in\r\nseasonal history, but it attacks principally the fruit of the black\r\nwalnut and butternut, apparently preferring the former.\r\n\r\nThe hickory nut curculio[13] is much like the preceding two species, but\r\nit attacks chiefly partly grown hickory nuts, causing a heavy dropping\r\nin midsummer.\r\n\r\nThe hickory shoot curculio[14] attacks chiefly the shoots of various\r\nkinds of hickory. The damage is seldom of much importance except to\r\nnewly transplanted trees. On pecan it attacks the unfolding buds and\r\nshoots. Pecans most commonly attacked are those that are uncultivated or\r\nare adjacent to woodlands containing native pecan and hickory trees.\r\n\r\nFor many years these curculios have been controlled by spraying the\r\ntrees soon after growth starts with lead arsenate, 2 pounds per 100\r\ngallons, plus an equal amount of hydrated lime. One or two additional\r\napplications may be needed as new growth appears or as the nuts increase\r\nin size. Recent experimental work indicates that BHC or lindane may be\r\nmore effective for controlling these insects. A spray containing 3 or 4\r\npounds of technical BHC (10-percent gamma) or 1-1/2 to 2 pounds of\r\n25-percent lindane wettable powder per 100 gallons, applied when the\r\nbuds show from 1/4 to 1 inch of green growth or when jarrings show\r\nadults are present, has given fairly good control.\r\n\r\n\r\nWalnut Husk Maggot\r\n\r\nThe walnut husk maggot[15] attacks black and English walnuts,\r\nbutternuts, and a few other nuts. The feeding of the larva, or maggot,\r\nin the husks impairs the quality of the kernels, discolors the shell,\r\nand often causes the shells to adhere to the nuts. It causes the most\r\ndamage to English walnuts. This insect hibernates in the pupal stage in\r\nthe ground. In midsummer it transforms to the adult fly stage, leaves\r\nthe soil, and flies to the nut trees. After 1 to 3 weeks the flies lay\r\neggs in the husks of the developing nuts. The eggs hatch in a week or 10\r\ndays, and the young maggots burrow within and throughout the husks of\r\nthe nuts; they mature in the fall.\r\n\r\nThe walnut husk maggot can be controlled by spraying the trees with lead\r\narsenate or cryolite the latter part of July and again 3 to 4 weeks\r\nlater. Use 2 or 3 pounds of lead arsenate plus an equal quantity of\r\nhydrated lime or 3 pounds of cryolite per 100 gallons of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nFilbert Moth\r\n\r\nThe filbert moth,[16] a serious pest in some filbert orchards in Oregon,\r\nalso causes some injury to chestnuts. Adult moths begin emerging toward\r\nthe end of June and lay their eggs singly on the leaves beginning early\r\nin July. The newly hatched larvae tunnel through the husk and feed\r\nbetween the husk and the chestnut shell before entering the nut. This\r\nfeeding produces a gummy substance, which causes the husk to adhere to\r\nthe nut. The larvae may tunnel into the center of the kernel or excavate\r\nan irregular cavity in the side. They reach maturity about the time nuts\r\nare ripe, and then leave the nuts and construct cocoons in the soil in\r\nwhich to pass the winter.\r\n\r\nControl can be obtained by spraying the tree with lead arsenate or DDT\r\nearly in July. Use 3 pounds of lead arsenate or 2 pounds of 50-percent\r\nDDT wettable powder in 100 gallons of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nMites\r\n\r\nTwo general types of mites sometimes damage nut trees, eriophyid mites\r\nand spider mites. The most important eriophyid mites are the wormlike\r\ngall mites and bud mites, most of which overwinter in the buds and cause\r\ndeformities of the buds and leaves and otherwise limit their\r\ndevelopment. The spider mites may overwinter in the egg stage on the\r\ntwigs or as adults in protected places on or beneath the trees. These\r\nmites feed primarily on the foliage.\r\n\r\nThe filbert bud mite[17] is occasionally of economic importance as a\r\npest of filberts in Oregon and has been of some concern recently in New\r\nYork. It attacks the leaf and flower buds and catkins. Infested catkins\r\nbecome distorted, rigid, and brittle, and yield no pollen. In Oregon\r\nthis pest has been controlled with 3 gallons of a dormant oil emulsion\r\nor 6-1/2 to 8 gallons of liquid lime-sulfur in water to make 100 gallons\r\nof spray just as the buds are opening. Related species of similar habits\r\nthat attack walnuts have been controlled with 9 or 10 gallons of liquid\r\nlime-sulfur in water to make 100 gallons of spray applied at the time\r\nthe buds break or soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nThe feeding of the spider mites on the foliage of infested trees causes\r\nit first to have a bronzed or scorched appearance, and later to dry up\r\nand fall. These mites frequently become abundant following the use of\r\nsome of the new organic insecticides, such as DDT and BHC, which destroy\r\ntheir natural enemies and perhaps have other effects on the trees\r\nfavorable to mite activity. The European red mite, which overwinters\r\non the trees in the egg stage, can be controlled by application of\r\n3-percent oil-emulsion spray in the late-dormant period. The two-spotted\r\nspider mite and related species, as well as the European red mite if it\r\nis not controlled with the dormant spray, can be controlled with a spray\r\ncontaining 1 pound of a 15-percent parathion or 1-1/2 pounds of a\r\n15-percent Aramite wettable powder per 100 gallons. Apply the spray\r\nbefore many leaves show the typical bronzing or leaf scorching. If the\r\ninfestation is heavy, a second application may be necessary in about 8\r\nor 10 days. Be sure to follow the precautions on the container,\r\nespecially if you use parathion.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: We greatly appreciate your care in getting this\r\nthing together, and we know it is going to be a great help to us when we\r\nget it printed as a matter of reference.\r\n\r\nMR. O'ROURKE: I'd like to ask Dr. Baker if insects are getting stronger\r\nor if the chemicals are getting weaker. I refer to the rates of\r\napplication. Formerly we were told that one-half pound of parathion for\r\none hundred gallons and one pound of DDT would control almost all\r\ninsects. I note the rates are going up.\r\n\r\nMR. BAKER: That's true, particularly with parathion. The first year that\r\nwe tested parathion on any scale we thought a quarter to a half a pound\r\nwould control mites for 30 days or more and would control curculio for\r\n20 or 30 days, but the next year we used it we found that was a little\r\noptimistic. It seems that each year since we have had to use more of it\r\nor use it more often, or with mites, particularly, there are a number of\r\ninstances where it just doesn't control them at all.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago that came to notice in the Wenatchee area of Washington on\r\napples. Mites in a certain orchard just couldn't be controlled with\r\nparathion. A year ago the area in the Pacific Northwest where that was\r\ntrue was extended and included several orchards of the Yakima Valley.\r\nThis year it also includes orchards in the East, in New York. We have\r\nseen an orchard where two pounds of parathion and a hundred gallons of\r\nwater just didn't have much effect on the mites, and we have had to use\r\nother materials. We hear of instances of codling moth on apples where\r\nDDT doesn't seem to be as good as it was in the beginning. I have talked\r\nwith some of the people working on the problem, and they find that there\r\nis quite a difference between different brands of some of these\r\ninsecticides. Possibly that is the answer.\r\n\r\nMR. MACHOVINA: After spraying for shuck maggot with DDT do you encourage\r\nthe presence of mites?\r\n\r\nMR. BAKER: It's very possible that you might. That has happened where\r\nDDT has been used. With some of our work with chestnut weevils, mites\r\nseem to be a little more abundant where we used DDT. We have had reports\r\nof this happening in California where they used DDT on walnuts. So it is\r\na possibility, and that's why I brought into the paper a little\r\ninformation on the control of mites.\r\n\r\nSession closed at 4:15 o'clock, p.m.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Hyphantria cunea_ (Drury).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Datana integerrima_ G. & R.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Clastoptera achatina_ Germ.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Phylloxera devastatrix_ Perg.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Oncideres cingulata_ (Say).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _Curculio auriger_ Casey.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _C. proboscideus_ F.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Curculio caryae_ (Horn).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Conotrachelus juglandis_ Lee.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Conotrachelus retentus_ Say.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Conotrachelus affinis_ Boh.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Conotrachelus aratus_ Germ.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Rhagoletis suavis_ Loew.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Melissopus latiferreanus_ (Wlsm.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Phytoptus avellanae_ Nal.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY EVENING BANQUET SESSION\r\n\r\nWe will now have the report of the Resolutions Committee.\r\n\r\nMR. DAVIDSON: \"To Royal Oakes, Chairman of the Program Committee, and to\r\nJ. Ford Wilkinson, the City of Rockport and its hospitable people, the\r\nNorthern Nut Growers Association extends its grateful greetings to you\r\nand to your loyal helpers, mentioning only a few; that is, Mrs. Negus,\r\nMr. and Mrs. Sly, Mr. Richard Best, a group of people who say little and\r\nwho do much, our very hearty thanks to you and to your helpers. We have\r\nhad a splendid meeting, good attendance, good fellowship and tomorrow a\r\ngood field trip.\r\n\r\n\"RESOLUTION: The sincere and grateful appreciation of this Association\r\nis hereby tendered to J. C. McDaniel, who has so faithfully and\r\nfruitfully served it as Secretary for five years. Your creation of new\r\navenues of service, such as _The Nutshell_ is sufficient evidence of\r\nyour resourcefulness in a difficult and most important office.\r\n\r\n\"RESOLUTION: Be it resolved, that this Association instruct its Secretary\r\nto communicate the following action to the responsible agencies of\r\nFederal and State authorities in all areas where the oak wilt disease is\r\npresent or threatens:\r\n\r\n\"'The oak wilt disease threatens severe damage to our eastern and\r\nsouthern oaks and Chinese chestnut trees. Recently reported spread of\r\nthe disease in Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania indicates\r\na very serious and critical situation. All state and federal authorities\r\nare urged to take prompt and appropriate action before it is too late.'\"\r\n\r\nAll NNGA members are asked to write to their state and federal senators\r\nand representatives urging immediate preventive measures against the\r\nspread and for the eradication of the oak wilt disease. Please write\r\nthose letters. They are important.\r\n\r\n\"To Dr. Deming, greetings and congratulations from your Association on\r\nthe occasion of your 90th birthday, September 1, 1952. May your years\r\ncontinue to be golden and happy. May our organization deserve in the\r\nfuture the gifts of inspiration and accomplishment that you have had so\r\nlarge a part in giving it in the past.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Dr. J. Russell Smith: The Northern Nut Growers assembled at Rockport\r\nsend greetings and best wishes to you. We miss you this year and hope to\r\nsee you at Rochester, New York, next year.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Mildred Jones Langdoc. Mildred: We have missed you at our meeting.\r\nYour absence is noted by all who know you. May the illness in your home\r\nbe short. May we see you and your family in Rochester in 1953.\"\r\n\r\n\"RESOLUTION: On behalf of the members of the Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation the Secretary is asked to send our affectionate greetings to\r\ntwo well-loved, absent members, Mrs. C. A. Reed and Mrs. G. A.\r\nZimmerman: 'Best wishes to you both for speedy recovery of good health\r\nand with our hope to see you next year.'\"\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: Is it your pleasure to adopt these resolutions all\r\nat once, or do you wish to separate them? I take it that you wish to\r\nadopt them, all at the same time, and to that end a motion to accept the\r\nreport of the Resolutions Committee and to adopt the resolutions and to\r\nsend the greetings would be appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe report of the resolutions committee was accepted unanimously.\r\n\r\nMR. MCDANIEL: Before this meeting convened we planned a bud wood\r\nexchange at the convention. Mr. Gerardi and I brought some buds, and Mr.\r\nRichard brought a few of the Rhodes heartnut. We have persimmons, some\r\nbuds of the new Crandall apple, and a few sticks of Chinese and hybrid\r\nchestnuts. They are for anyone who would like to experiment with them.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: Next year at Rochester we are going to have\r\nopportunity for putting on a considerable exhibit of nuts, and I think\r\nthat it would be much to the advantage of the Association, if we could\r\nhave an outstanding exhibit there where there is a good chance to have a\r\nlarge number of people see the exhibits and become interested. To that\r\nend I think that all of us who have nut trees bearing this fall, should\r\nsave some samples with extra care; that is, clean them up, make them\r\nlook attractive and have them on hand ready for the exhibit next fall.\r\n\r\nA good sample for exhibit should be about 10 or a dozen for black\r\nwalnuts and the Persian walnuts and perhaps 20 to 25 for the hickories\r\nand the smaller nuts, the hazel, particularly. I think that we have a\r\ngood chance next year to forward the cause of the Association, and\r\ncertainly having these exhibits will be much to our advantage.\r\n\r\nAt this time, towards the end of our session, it is our usual custom to\r\nelect our next year's officers. Before going on with that election, I\r\nwould just like to say that I personally, as president of the\r\nAssociation during this year, wish to thank all of the other officers\r\nwho have worked with me. It has been a pleasure to work with them and\r\nwith the committee chairmen, and I think the meeting here at Rockport\r\nand the work during the year attest to their effective service.\r\n\r\nThe Nominations Committee report. For president next year, Mr. R. B.\r\nBest; for vice-president, George Salzer of Rochester, New York; for\r\nTreasurer, Carl Prell of South Bend, Indiana, who continues in the\r\noffice; and for Secretary Mr. Spencer Chase of Norris, Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe slate presented was elected unanimously.\r\n\r\nA nominating committee consisting of Max Hardy, Gilbert Becker, George\r\nSlate, Dr. William Rohrbacker, and Ford Wilkinson was unanimously\r\nelected for 1953.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MacDANIELS: I will now call upon our newly elected president\r\nto come forward. It is usual at these meetings for the retiring\r\npresident to present the gavel to the incoming president, and here it\r\nis. This gavel is made of pecan wood presented to the Association by Mr.\r\nT. P. Littlepage, who was born in this locality. I hope you will have as\r\nmuch fun and pleasure as president of the Association as I have had.\r\nIt's all yours.\r\n\r\nMR. WILKINSON: That gavel was made from the wood of a pecan tree. Mr. T.\r\nP. Littlepage planted the nut when he was 14 years old on a piece of\r\nland that he inherited as a boy. I cut the wood and sent it to him in\r\nWashington to have the gavel made of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChestnut Breeding\r\n\r\nReport for 1951-1952\r\n\r\nARTHUR H. GRAVES[18] and HANS NIENSTAEDT, _Connecticut Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station, New Haven, Conn._\r\n\r\n\r\nWeather Conditions\r\n\r\nTwo serious enemies of the chestnut, if we disregard parasitic\r\norganisms, are drought and extreme cold. The winter of 1950-51 was\r\nunusually mild--scarcely cold enough to freeze the ground. The\r\nprecipitation was plentiful during the winter months so that the water\r\ntable was sufficient to tide over a slightly dry June and a much more\r\nserious drought in September and early October. But the latter dry\r\nperiod came when the nuts were matured, or nearly so.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1951-52 was again mild except for a short cold spell at\r\nthe end of January, with plentiful precipitation up to the first week of\r\nJune, and then a long drought with the driest July since 1944. However,\r\nthe heavy rainfall of August, 8.69 inches,[19] made amends for this,\r\nand with the normal rainfall of 3.48 inches of September, prepared the\r\ntrees to endure the long drought of October and early November. This\r\nserious drought,[20] which resulted in disastrous forest fires filling\r\nthe air with smoke over much of the New England States, came late,\r\nhowever, after the nuts were nearly matured, some of the early kinds\r\nbeing ripe as early as the first week in September.\r\n\r\nThe excessive heat of July, in which month occurred the greatest number\r\nof days on record with a maximum temperature of 90 degrees or above, was\r\nprobably the chief cause of somewhat smaller results from our cross\r\npollination work. There is evidence, indeed, that for effective\r\nfertilization, considerable heat is needed, but not the extreme\r\ntemperatures that occurred during this period.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the mild winter of 1951-52, the attacks of _Cryptodiaporthe\r\ncastanea_ (Tul.) Wehmeyer caused considerable twig blight, especially on\r\nour crosses of _Castanea mollissimax seguini_. This is not surprising\r\nsince _C. seguini_ comes from a warmer region in China, but why these\r\nattacks should occur during a mild winter is a puzzle. Evidently other\r\nfactors, such as the drought of the preceding fall, entered in.\r\n\r\n\r\nHybridization in 1951 and 1952\r\n\r\nA total of 2400 hybrid nuts was harvested in the 1951 season and 1690 in\r\n1952. This compares with the 1259 nuts reported for 1950. The increased\r\nproduction over past years can in part be ascribed to a concentration of\r\nthe efforts on a fewer number of different crosses; while 103 were made\r\nin 1950, the total was 77 in 1951 and 80 in 1952. The pollinations\r\nfollowed the same general program in the two seasons, the emphasis being\r\non the Chinese x (Japanese x American) hybrids. This is our most\r\npromising timber tree hybrid, and it seems worthwhile to test it on a\r\nsomewhat larger scale under forest conditions. Therefore, some of the\r\nbest early crosses have been repeated, new parent trees are being tried\r\nand selected hybrids intercrossed. Back-crosses to the native chestnut\r\nwith the CxJA hybrids were made in an attempt to improve the form of the\r\nhybrid.\r\n\r\nAnother cross which has attained some importance in the last years is\r\nthe hybrid between Japanese chestnut (forest type, from U.S.D.A.) and\r\nS-8, the latter being a hybrid between Japanese chestnut and _C.\r\npumila_, the common chinquapin. This cross has a high degree of\r\nresistance and a sufficiently good form to make it a possible timber\r\ntree (Fig. 1). It is also a fairly good nut bearer with nuts which ripen\r\nearly, perhaps due to the influence of the chinquapin parent (Fig. 2).\r\nSelected individuals of this hybrid were intercrossed, and some crossing\r\nwith the native chestnut was done.\r\n\r\nIn the last two seasons the total harvest from some older Chinese trees\r\n(26 yrs.) was recorded. The best tree yielded 25.0 lbs. in 1951 and 28.2\r\nlbs. in 1952; on other trees the yield varied between 15 to 22 lbs. The\r\naverage size of the nuts varies considerably from year to year on the\r\nsame tree. On one Japanese tree the average weight per nut was 5.6 g.\r\nin 1951 and 14.5 g. in 1952; on a Chinese tree the same values were 7.7\r\ng. and 15.1 g. Other trees showed a 20-40 per cent increase in the\r\naverage weight per nut in 1952 over 1951. This seems to indicate a\r\nmarked influence of the climatic conditions during the latter part of\r\nthe growing season on the weight of the nuts. A long-term study of this\r\nrelationship might yield some interesting results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Hybrid of S-8 and _Castanea crenata_, U.S.D.A,\r\nforest type, 18 years old.

Agric. Expt. Sta. Sept. 8, 1952.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGrafting\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of grafting has been done since 1949 and the\r\nresults have been good. Two year old Chinese transplants are usually\r\nused as rootstocks and all grafting is done in the field. The best\r\nresults have been obtained where the rootstock plant was transplanted\r\none year prior to the grafting. The simple splicegraft, or the bark or\r\nrind graft are used, depending on the size of the scion compared to that\r\nof the rootstock, the latter technique being used when the stock is\r\nconsiderably larger than the scion. There is some evidence of\r\nincompatibility; thus, scions from Chinese trees, or hybrids that show a\r\ndominance of Chinese characters, give a higher percentage of takes when\r\ngrafted on Chinese rootstocks than scions from the native chestnut, or\r\nfrom hybrids between Japanese and native chestnut. Some indications of\r\nincompatibility between European and Chinese chestnut in grafts have\r\nalso been encountered where scions received through the cooperation of\r\nDr. C. Schad, Centre de Recherches agronomiques du Massif Central,\r\nFrance, and Count F. M. Knuth, Knuthenborg, Denmark, were used, but in\r\nsome cases these grafts were successful. Topworking, using the veneer\r\ncrown graft, has been quite successful as long as sufficient sap drawers\r\nare left on the stock (Fig. 3).\r\n\r\n\r\nInarching\r\n\r\nThe senior writer has already explained in detail (2) the simple method\r\nby which blighted chestnut trees can be restored to health and vigor by\r\ncutting out blighted areas in the bark, painting them over, and\r\ninarching or ingrafting one or more basal shoots into the healthy bark\r\nabove the lesion. We do this work from mid-April to mid-May, and make a\r\nsystematic canvas of all the trees in all our plantations, inarching all\r\nthose where if is necessary or might be advantageous. Each operation\r\nrequires only a few minutes. Last year we put in many hundreds of\r\ninarches, altogether, which later showed nearly 100% \"take\".\r\n\r\nOwners of chestnut orchards should take advantage of this method of\r\nkeeping valuable nut-bearing trees, although with cankered areas, in\r\nhealthy, vigorous condition.\r\n\r\nWe believe that, in cutting out the diseased bark, it is advisable to\r\ncut out also a few of the outer annual rings of wood (of course\r\ntangentially), especially if the canker is one of long-standing, since\r\nwe know that the fungus eventually penetrates the outer rings of wood.\r\nSince that is true, the canker might enlarge later on from this same\r\nsource of infection. Further it may also be possible for spores or bits\r\nof mycelium to be transported upward in the sap stream and cause new\r\ninfections higher up in the tree. A thorough painting of the cut\r\nsurfaces should go far toward remedying this situation.\r\n\r\nOne can usually judge the extent of damage caused by the blight by the\r\nnumber and vitality of the basal shoots, a large number of basal shoots\r\nindicating a heavy attack. However, if the roots have been severely\r\ninjured, perhaps by short-tailed mice, as sometimes happens, no basal\r\nshoots appear, in which case the tree is doomed.\r\n\r\nIf no blight is present, but one or more basal shoots appear (sometimes\r\ndue to shrubby ancestors), it is advisable to inarch these as an\r\ninsurance against possible trouble in the future.\r\n\r\nThis inarching process has not received the attention it deserves. There\r\nis absolutely no reason why, if this method is followed, there should be\r\n_any_ death from blight in resistant hybrids or in Japanese or Chinese\r\nchestnuts, barring, of course, cases where roots are attacked by mice\r\n(or _Phytophthora_ in warmer regions). Those of our trees in Connecticut\r\nwhich have been blighted have continued in health and nut-bearing ever\r\nsince we began the inarching method in 1937 (Fig. 4). If the inarches\r\nbecome blighted, they can themselves be inarched, as shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Veneer crown grafting on chestnut. Photo by B. W.\r\nMcFarland, Conn. Agric. Expt. Sta.

Original trunk, long since dead and now\r\nrotting, shows in center. Kept alive and vigorous because valuable for\r\nhybrid vigor and future breeding. Sleeping Giant Chestnut Plantation,\r\nHamden, Conn. Photo by Louis Buhle, Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Sept. 26,\r\n1952.]\r\n\r\nA study has been made of the factors that cause the Chinese and Japanese\r\nchestnut to be resistant to the Endothia canker, and a close correlation\r\nwas found between the tannin content of the bark and the relative\r\nresistance of the three species, i.e., Chinese, Japanese and American\r\nchestnut. The total tannin concentration in the bark of the Asiatic\r\nspecies is only slightly higher than in the American, and native trees\r\ncan be found with as high a concentration as is found in the Asiatic. A\r\nsimilar overlap in resistance does not occur and it is therefore clear\r\nthat the total tannin concentration as such cannot account for\r\nresistance. There is, however, good evidence that the tannins in the\r\nAsiatic species, as a result of the way in which they are bound to other\r\ncolloids in the cells, are more soluble than in the American species.\r\nThis, of course, would have a marked bearing on the effectiveness with\r\nwhich the tannins could check the spread of the parasite. Furthermore,\r\nit has been found that the types of tannins in the three species differ.\r\nIn the American and Japanese species they are a mixture of catechol and\r\npyrogallol tannins, while they appear to be pure pyrogallol tannins in\r\nthe Chinese species. Considering the specificity of the enzyme systems\r\nof fungi it is quite possible that different tannins show different\r\ndegrees of toxicity to a certain fungus. The following hypothesis has\r\nbeen suggested to explain the relative resistance of the three species:\r\nIn the American chestnut bark the concentration of the available toxic\r\ntannin never reaches a level where it can stop the advancing parasite.\r\nThe tannins in the Japanese species, although of the same type as in\r\nthe native tree, are more soluble and reach a level toxic to the fungus.\r\nIn the Chinese trees all the tannins of the bark belong to the toxic\r\npyrogallol groups, and this, combined with their high solubility,\r\nresults in the high degree of resistance in this species (4).\r\n\r\nThe information available at present regarding the formation of tannins\r\nin plants is not conclusive. In some plants, apparently, they are formed\r\nin the leaves, and the presence of carbon dioxide and light is required;\r\nin other plants the tannin concentration can increase when the plants\r\nare grown in darkness (5). A more general formation of tannin in tissues\r\nwith a high metabolic rate throughout the plant has also been suggested\r\n(3).\r\n\r\nIt would be important to know the centers of origin of the tannins in\r\nthe chestnut, their translocation, and whether they are translocated\r\nthrough or over graft-unions. In other words, will a susceptible scion\r\nwhen grafted on a resistant rootstock become more resistant because\r\nantibiotic substances formed in the roots of the resistant rootstock are\r\ntranslocated into the scion?\r\n\r\nFrom a number of older grafts of non-resistant Japanese-American hybrid\r\nscions on Japanese or Chinese rootstocks it appears that this indeed\r\nmight be the case. These grafts, some of which are 16 years old, appear\r\nto be more resistant than the original hybrid tree, even if not as\r\nresistant as the rootstock.\r\n\r\nThis would indicate the possibility that the antibiotic substances are\r\nproduced in the roots and translocated into the scion. However, the\r\npossibility still remains that the compounds are formed also in the\r\nleaves and translocated to the base of the tree. To clarify this whole\r\nproblem an experiment with Chinese-American grafts in different\r\ncombinations is under way. Preliminary results show that antibiotic\r\nsubstances are formed in upper parts of the plants, but that they are\r\nnot translocated downward across the graft union. Thus it was found that\r\nChinese branches grafted on two year old American seedlings remained\r\nresistant, without the American seedlings showing any increase in\r\nresistance. In future experiments the upward translocation will be\r\nstudied in detail on grafts of American scions on Chinese seedlings.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Abnormal Conditions\r\n\r\n1. _Sterility_\r\n\r\nSterility occurs quite commonly in interspecific hybrids either because\r\nthe chromosomes fail to pair in meiosis or because the parent genes when\r\nbrought together in the hybrid interact in some way deleterious to the\r\nformation of sex-cells. Furthermore, cytoplasmic sterility is likely to\r\noccur in a wide cross.\r\n\r\nSterility has been encountered in several instances in American x\r\nChinese and Japanese x American hybrids. In most cases it is a case of\r\npollen abortion only; either anthers fail to develop completely as shown\r\nin Fig. 5, B, or the anthers develop but are much reduced in size and\r\ncontain no functioning germ cells.\r\n\r\nPollen sterility is not sporadic in a given individual: it is uniform\r\nthroughout the flowering branches. The individual flowers are\r\narranged on the catkin axis as in the normal flowers (Fig. 5). But\r\nwhen the flowers open, a hand lens reveals 3-5 tiny, membranous\r\nperianth-segments for each tiny flower, whitish in color, and more or\r\nless connected at their bases. A minute rounded mass appears in the\r\ncenter of the flower, perhaps primordia of abortive stamens, but this\r\ndoes not develop further. The catkin begins to take on a brownish color\r\nand at length the whole catkin, in case it is staminate, drops off. If\r\nit is androgynous, the staminate part drops off, or withers.\r\n\r\nThese male sterile trees appear to have a normal, sometimes excessive,\r\ndevelopment of the females, and are quite prolific nut producers.\r\nInformation on the occurrence of female sterility in the hybrid trees is\r\nincomplete, but the indications are that at least partial sterility is\r\nfrequent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. A. Normal androgynous catkin (female flower at\r\nbase); B. Androgenous catkin with sterile pollen. From Sleeping Giant\r\nChestnut Plantation, Hamden, Conn. Photo by Mary Alice Clark, Conn.\r\nAgric. Expt. Sta. July, 1949.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Triploid Hybrid_\r\n\r\nIn 1934 we produced a cross of Chinese and American chestnut which\r\nproved to be unusual in several respects. The leaves are enormous--9\r\ninches to 1 foot in length, and 4 or 5 inches in width. The hybrid is\r\nnot particularly blight resistant but more so than its American parent.\r\nIt died back from the blight about 1940 and the present tree has\r\ndeveloped as a shoot from the old roots. The growth is rapid and\r\nvigorous. The flowers appear normal, but we have never been able to make\r\na cross with its pollen, nor to effect fertilization of its pistillate\r\nflowers. It may be triploid, that is, with 3 sets of chromosomes instead\r\nof the normal double set, and this would account for its barrenness.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1952 some of the vigorous shoots of this tree were\r\nsuccessfully grafted on shoots from an old stump of Chinese chestnut,\r\nusing the veneer crown graft method. The scions had not been taken when\r\ndormant, but were transferred directly from the tree to the stock in\r\nlate April. This grafting was done in order to impart greater\r\nresistance, if possible, to the CA hybrid by means of the roots of the\r\nChinese stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Systemic Defect_\r\n\r\nSince the early 1930's we have seen occasional individuals with abnormal\r\nfoliage--somewhat mottled, usually curled and often misshapen. Thinking\r\nthat a virus might be the cause of this trouble the senior author tried\r\ngrafting some of the shoots on to healthy stocks. The grafts were in no\r\ncase successful because the scions were too weak. Finally he succeeded\r\nin grafting a branch from an affected tree on to a branch of a normal\r\nindividual. The only result was an increased vigor of the healthy\r\nbranch. This year he rubbed juices from leaves of such an abnormal\r\nindividual on to wounded healthy leaves, without result. Moreover, such\r\nsick individuals, although growing for years close to healthy trees,\r\nhave never communicated the malady to their neighbors. Growth is\r\ncomparatively slow, and there is much dying back or dying out of the\r\nslender branchlets.\r\n\r\nThe evidence indicates that this is _not_ a virus trouble, but a\r\nsystemic defect, probably caused by chromosome aberration or gene\r\nabnormality. It is significant that this trouble occurs only in hybrids.\r\nSuch trees never flower. We have known four such cases, two of which are\r\nnow dead. Similar types appear in other species as inherited deviations\r\nfrom normal.\r\n\r\n\r\nInsect Injuries\r\n\r\nA heavy attack from the spring canker worms developed in 1951, but\r\nspraying with DDT on May 24th prevented serious damage. No outbreak of\r\ncanker worms appeared in the spring of 1952. The Japanese beetle has\r\nbeen very little in evidence. The principal bad actors are the mites,\r\n_Paratetranychus bicolor._ Although barely visible to the naked eye, the\r\neffect they produce of whitening the leaves is conspicuous, especially\r\non the Chinese chestnut and its hybrids. These insects overwinter in egg\r\nform on the surface of the bark. Last winter they were so numerous on\r\nsome of the trees that the bark had taken on a red color--especially on\r\nsmooth-barked trunks just below a branch. An application of \"Scalecide\"\r\non April 21, while the trees were still dormant, followed by two heavy\r\napplications of \"Aramite\" (6-7 lbs. per acre) on June 13th and 27th,\r\ngave good control for the rest of the summer. Spraying with DDT for\r\nweevils was done on August 18th and September 3rd in 1952 with good\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\nCooperative Hybrid Chestnut Plantations\r\n\r\nIn 1947 the first hybrid chestnut plantation under forest conditions was\r\nmade in cooperation with the U.S.D.A. Bureau of Plant Industry, Division\r\nof Forest Pathology. The plantations are made in order to test the\r\nhybrids under normal forest conditions and different climatic\r\nconditions. In general, each plantation consists of about 100 trees, 50\r\nU.S.D.A. hybrids and 50 Connecticut hybrids. The trees are planted at a\r\n10' by 10' spacing, and the overstory is girdled at the time of planting\r\nin order to give the plants better light conditions without causing an\r\nabrupt change in the microclimate of the forest floor--a method\r\ndeveloped by Dr. J. D. Diller of the Division of Forest Pathology (1).\r\nTen plantations at 9 locations have been established since 1947.

The meeting was attended by officials of the Sleeping Giant Park\r\nAssociation, the Connecticut State Park and Forest Commission, The\r\nConnecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, and the Yale School of\r\nForestry. The transfer to the State was made with the understanding that\r\nThe Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station would continue the\r\nchestnut breeding work. The whole region is now undergoing a fairly\r\nrapid housing development, and in the ordinary course of mortal events\r\nthis plantation would have been divided into building lots within the\r\nnext few decades. The State ownership will obviate this, and The\r\nConnecticut Agricultural Experiment Station sponsorship will assure a\r\ncontinuation of the breeding work.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiterature Cited\r\n\r\n     1.

BARRETT[21] and TORU ARISUMI[22]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen seedlings of nut trees and other tap-rooted species are\r\ntransplanted from nursery to orchard, the percentage of survival in\r\noften quite low. Perhaps the chief reason for this failure is the marked\r\nand pronounced tendency of most tap-rooted plants to produce little or\r\nno fibrous, branched roots in lieu of the long, straight, and seldom\r\nbranched tap roots.\r\n\r\nThe common practice of undercutting seedlings during the dormant season\r\nto induce a branched root system requires additional labor, and often\r\nresults in reduced growth and vigor during the following season. The use\r\nof hardware cloth or other close-meshed wire is effective, but this\r\nmethod also has the disadvantage of being relatively expensive for the\r\nnurseryman.\r\n\r\nPreliminary work carried on during the past two years has shown that\r\nwith certain nut trees and other tap-rooted plants, it is possible to\r\ninduce fibrous roots by growing such seedlings in vermiculite. The\r\nmethods and results of this work are presented in this paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaterial and Methods\r\n\r\nSeeds of black walnut (_Juglans nigra_), Persian walnut (_Juglans\r\nregia_), Chinese chestnut (_Castanea mollissima_), pignut hickory\r\n(_Carya glabra_), shellbark hickory (_Carya laciniosa_), shagbark\r\nhickory (_Carya ovata_), pecan (_Carya illin_), pawpaw (_Asimina\r\ntriloba_), and three persimmons (_Diospyros kaki_, _D. lotus_, and _D.\r\nvirginiana_) were stratified in moist sawdust for three months at a\r\ntemperature range of 35 to 40 degrees F. After this period of\r\nstratification the seeds of each species were divided into three lots\r\nand planted in flats 25 x 26 x 6 inches containing one of the following\r\nmedia: (1) sharp sand of the type used in potting soil, (2) potting\r\nsoil, and (3) vermiculite. Seeds were kept moist with ordinary tap water\r\nand allowed to germinate and grow in the greenhouse. When the seedlings\r\nhad grown two or three true leaves, they were carefully removed from the\r\nmedium and examined for the type of root system developed.\r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nIn the first eight species listed in Table 1, the differences between\r\nbranched and tap-rooted seedlings were quite pronounced. The few\r\ntap-rooted seedlings growing in vermiculite medium showed some laterals\r\nand were less strongly tap-rooted than those in soil or sand. Pawpaws in\r\nsoil and sand media were practically devoid of laterals, and their\r\nfibrous root system in vermiculite was not as pronounced as with the\r\nwalnuts, hickories, and pecans. Of the species studied, the persimmons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1.\r\n\r\n                          Sand                 Soil           Vermiculite\r\n\r\n   Species                               Number of plants\r\n                   Tap rooted Fibrous       Tap  Fibrous       Tap  Fibrous\r\n\r\n   Black Walnut          20     3            24    2             0    39\r\n   Persian Walnut        15     2            13    1             0    15\r\n   Chinese Chestnut      35     6            32    7             3    37\r\n   Pignut Hickory        19     0            22    0             3    16\r\n   Shellbark Hickory      9     0             8    0             0    13\r\n   Shagbark Hickory      27     0            25    0             2    28\r\n   Pecan                 21     0            23    0             0    15\r\n   Pawpaw               102     0           140    0            20    85\r\n   D. kaki                6     2             5    3             0    10\r\n   D. lotus              20    11            18    7             0    30\r\n   D.

The methods and results of a fairly simple\r\ntechnique of inducing fibrous roots, that of growing seedlings in\r\nvermiculite, have been presented.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: First Assistant in Plant Breeding, University of Illinois,\r\nDepartment of Horticulture.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Formerly Half-time Assistant in Plant Breeding, University\r\nof Illinois, Department of Horticulture.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEastern Black Walnut Survey, 1951\r\n\r\nH. F. STOKE, _Roanoke, Va._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Northern Nut Growers Association, at its 1950 Annual Meeting,\r\nadopted a resolution directing that a survey covering the eastern\r\nAmerican black walnut, _Juglans nigra_ be conducted during the ensuing\r\nyear, and that the services of the State and regional Vice-presidents be\r\nutilized in making the survey.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out this mandate fifty questionaires were sent out, and 37\r\nreplies were received. Of these, 33 were from the States, including the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, three were from Canada, including British\r\nColumbia, Ontario and Prince Edward Island, respectively, and one was\r\nfrom Belgium.\r\n\r\nFrom these replies, as compiled, it is apparent that the natural range\r\nof the American black walnut may be defined approximately as follows:\r\n\r\nBeginning at the Atlantic seaboard at Massachusetts Bay curving slightly\r\nnorthward then westward across northeastern New York to Toronto and on\r\nwestward across lower Ontario, Lake Huron, Michigan, Wisconsin and\r\nMinnesota, in which state the line curves south-westward, crossing about\r\nthe northwest corner of Iowa. From this point the line runs\r\napproximately south across the eastern parts of Nebraska, Kansas,\r\nOklahoma and Texas. As the line approaches the Gulf of Mexico it turns\r\neastward, crossing the southern parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama\r\nand Georgia, back again to the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe natural range of the black walnut may be said to have been limited\r\non the north by winter cold, on the west by lack of sufficient rainfall\r\nand on the south by a winter climate too mild for the required dormant\r\nrest period. Where these limitations are removed the American black\r\nwalnut appears to do well far out of its natural range.\r\n\r\nIn its native state it seemed to thrive best along water-ways and in\r\nhollows among the hills and mountains, though it was also to be found on\r\nthe uplands wherever the soil was fertile and other conditions\r\nfavorable. The overflow of streams undoubtedly did much to distribute\r\nand plant the seed, aided always by the ubiquitous squirrel.\r\n\r\nTwenty-nine of the States reported the trees as thrifty and bearing\r\nwell-filled nuts. Eastern Maryland reported the trees as thrifty but the\r\nnut crop light. Michigan reports the nuts as having been well filled\r\nformerly, but poor in recent years. West Virginia makes a similar\r\nreport, and attributes poor crops to the presence of anthracnose, a\r\nfungus disease of the leaves causing early defoliation.\r\n\r\nThe nut crop of the wild trees appears to be ungathered to a large\r\nextent, taking the country as a whole.\r\n\r\nEleven states report whole husked nuts being marketed in a limited way\r\nand six report the marketing of home-produced kernels. Prices for the\r\nwhole nuts are quoted as low as $2.00 per bushel, with a top of $5.00\r\nper bushel for Kansas-produced named varieties.\r\n\r\nAccurate statistics as to whole nut and kernel production are not\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nTennessee reports black walnut cracking plants, as follows: One each at\r\nLebanon and Morristown, and three located at Nashville.\r\n\r\nA West Virginia report estimates the State's kernel production at\r\n$200,000 per annum. A cracking plant in St. Louis is reported as\r\nprocessing 1-1/2 million pounds of whole nuts annually, for which it\r\npays 5-1/2 cents per pound. Other cracking plants reported are one at\r\nStanford, Kentucky, one at Broadway, Virginia and one or two in West\r\nVirginia, location unstated. No statement was received as to the amount\r\nof business done by these. A new one is starting operations at\r\nHenderson, Kentucky in 1951.\r\n\r\nProduction of black walnut kernels as a home industry has languished\r\nsince the Federal ruling that the kernels must be pasteurized as soon as\r\nproduced. Most of such kernels are now consumed locally, so as not to\r\nrun afoul of inter-state regulations. No epidemic has, as yet, been\r\ntraced to such local use.\r\n\r\nA question designed to disclose what named varieties give the best\r\nresults in the various localities was not very effective. Replies\r\nusually came in the form of lists of varieties being planted with little\r\ndefinite indication as to the ones that have proven superior.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, Thomas led the list by being mentioned 15 times.\r\nElmer Myers was listed 9 times, Stabler 6, Ohio 6, Mintle 3, Snyder 2,\r\n(New York and Tenn.), Sifford 2, (Kentucky and Kansas), and the\r\nfollowing one each: Adams, Grundy, Korn (Michigan); Rohwer, Vandersloot\r\n(Kansas); Sparrow, Victoria, Homeland (North Carolina); Ten Eyck (New\r\nJersey); Creitz (Virginia); and Impit (British Columbia).\r\n\r\nA study of the geographical distribution of the preferred varieties\r\nfails to produce any significant conclusions as to the varieties best\r\nadapted to any specific state. Doubtless Thomas heads the list because\r\nit has had the longest and largest distribution. A New York state survey\r\ngave Thomas the preference 9 times, Snyder 7, Myers 4, Ohio 2, and one\r\neach to several other varieties. A similar survey in New Jersey gave\r\nThomas preference 2, Stabler 2, Ten Eyck 1 and Ohio 1.\r\n\r\nOne New Jersey correspondent reported Ohio as \"excellent\", another\r\nlisted Ten Eyck as \"fair\", and a third reported Thomas as \"terrible\".\r\n\r\nOne Kansas producer reports Thomas his best and Ohio his worst. Another\r\nKansan reports the exact opposite.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania reports Ohio as best, Stabler as worst. Her neighbor to the\r\neast, New Jersey, rates Stabler highly, as does Ohio, immediately to the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nThe notable leaf-disease resistance of the Ohio variety is worthy of the\r\nconsideration of planters in districts where early defoliation causes\r\npoor filling of the nuts.\r\n\r\nFor a late comer, the thin-shelled Myers makes a strong showing, which\r\nmay be significant. It is worth watching.\r\n\r\nUntil there is wider planting and production of the named varieties, it\r\nwill not be possible to name the varieties best adapted to any specific\r\nstate or location, in the opinion of your reporter.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of profit in planting black walnut orchards have not\r\nbeen determined.\r\n\r\nFrom Pennsylvania comes the report that of the several black walnut\r\norchards planted twenty-five years ago, only three are now being given\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nA ten-acre orchard at Wharton, Md. that, presumably, was being given\r\nspecial care, is reported as nearly all dead--\"too much commercial\r\nfertilizer, or the wrong kind.\"\r\n\r\nThe report on several small West Virginia plantings is submitted as\r\n\"inconclusive\".\r\n\r\nThe main general interest at present appears to be the planting of the\r\nbetter walnuts on home grounds and on the farm. Twenty-four states\r\nreported such use, with varying degrees of interest.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the black walnut is our finest cabinet wood, and one of\r\nthe best in the world, forestry planting may be truthfully said to be\r\nlagging deplorably.\r\n\r\nThe state of Pennsylvania has shown some interest and made some small\r\nplantings.\r\n\r\nOhio has done some planting. The Sunny Hill Coal Company of New\r\nLexington, Ohio, is reported to have planted 5000 seedlings.\r\n\r\nIn Indiana Ford Wallick has reported the planting of 14 bu. of seed, the\r\nseedlings to be budded later to the Lamb curly walnut. Tennessee and\r\nWest Virginia report small plantings.\r\n\r\nKansas reports some interest in planting walnuts on lands that have been\r\ndestroyed for agricultural purposes by strip coal mining.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, the forestry plantings of the walnut of the future, as of\r\nthe past, appear mainly dependent on the untiring squirrel.\r\n\r\nThere has never been an adequate supply of walnut timber since pioneer\r\ndays when walnut logs were rolled together for burning in the clearing\r\nof land, or split for fence rails, nor is an adequate supply in sight\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\nIn producing districts buyers are always ready to pounce on the owner of\r\nany walnut tree of marketable size. Prices paid are usually much lower\r\nthan the real value of the timber, partly because the stand is so\r\nscattering as to prevent the use of efficient means of logging and\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nOf all the agencies tending to destroy the black walnut, war is the most\r\ndevastating. The superb qualities of the wood for the making of gun\r\nstocks causes the country to be combed more and more closely by buyers\r\nin each succeeding war.\r\n\r\nHowever, from the standpoint of human interest, the picture is not\r\nwholly dark. It is perhaps too much to expect that private enterprise\r\nwill enter into the long-time investment necessary for extensive\r\nforestry plantings, but the states can and should do so in connection\r\nwith their park and forestry programs. As already indicated some few\r\nstates are working in that direction.\r\n\r\nOf perhaps more immediate concern and value are the possibilities of\r\ninteresting the 4-H clubs and similar organizations of youth in making\r\nhome and farm plantings. Refreshingly encouraging is the following\r\nexcerpt from the report of the Arkansas state Vice-president, Mr. A. C.\r\nHale, a vocational instructor of Camden, Arkansas.\r\n\r\n\"When a student comes into the class of vocational agriculture in the\r\nninth grade I try to get him to plant some black walnuts so they will\r\nget big enough to graft while he is in high school. The use of this\r\nmethod is helpful in getting many trees started. By grafting one or more\r\nof the Persian walnuts, interest is also added.\"\r\n\r\n\"One way that has helped me get people started with a tree on the home\r\ngrounds is to pot a few sprouted nuts and when a neighbor is sick take a\r\nseedling walnut instead of a flower. I usually go back to help with the\r\ntransplanting of it.\"\r\n\r\nSuch practical methods, if widely used, would bring far more valuable\r\nresults than any legislative program.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Polytechnic Institute is showing some interest, and\r\nconducted a field clinic in top-working the walnut in the Shenandoah\r\nValley area in the spring of 1951. County Agents have become interested,\r\nand a county-wide Black Walnut Contest will be held at Harrisonburg,\r\nVa., Nov. 9 and 10th of this year, in which VPI is collaborating. It is\r\nhoped this idea will spread.\r\n\r\nOn Prince Edward Island, just off the Canadian east coast, there does\r\nnot appear to be enough summer heat to mature the nuts, though the tree\r\nis grown somewhat on home grounds.\r\n\r\nIn the fruit-growing sections of British Columbia the black walnut\r\nappears quite at home, trees of a diameter of from three to four feet\r\nbeing reported at Chilliwack, in the Fraser River valley. J. U.\r\nGellattly also reports the walnut at Brooks and Medicine Hat, Alberta.\r\n\r\nConfirmation of the ability of the black walnut to stand extremely low\r\ntemperatures is to be found in a letter of Aug. 22, 1951 from W. R.\r\nLeslie, Superintendent, Dominion Experiment Station, Morden, Manitoba,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"Black walnut is doing fairly well in such places as the Provincial\r\nHorticultural Station, Brooks, Alberta, (P. D. Hargrave, Supt.), and at\r\nPortage la Prairie, Winnipeg and Morden, Manitoba. Apparently the black\r\nwalnut enjoys a heavier soil than the butternut (or white walnut). The\r\nwhite has been more widely planted than the black. The Manchurian seems\r\nhardier than either and is the most rapid grower of the three _Juglans_\r\non test here. However, the two natives usually give us a fairly abundant\r\ncrop of nuts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our source of black walnut was from around New Ulm, Minnesota; the\r\nbutternut came from around Sault Ste. Marie, at the lower end of Lake\r\nSuperior. I am not aware of either indigenous species being native\r\ncloser than the points mentioned.\"\r\n\r\nBelgium reports the black walnut as thriving in door-yards and along\r\nroadways, where the nuts are mentioned as a menace to traffic.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it is urged that friends of conservation and a sound\r\neconomy should lend their every effort to the extension of black walnut\r\nplantings. Some progress has been made since the days of pioneer\r\nplunder, but much remains to be done.\r\n\r\nThanks are extended to all those who have contributed to this survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrath's Carpathian English Walnuts in Ontario\r\n\r\n[23]P. C. CRATH, _129 Felbrigg Ave., Toronto 12, Ontario_\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nThe English Walnut (Juglans regia) in England is known as Persian\r\nwalnut. Some think that the nuts originated in Persia. The primeval\r\nforests of English walnut trees, which in many places cover the\r\nsouthern as well as northern slopes of the Caucasian Mountains show\r\nthat Caucasia is the country of the origin of those trees.\r\n\r\nBut in the Western Carpathian Mountains in Europe geologists had\r\nexcavated ancient walnuts in the salt rocks of the pits of Weliczka. In\r\nsome places of the Eastern Carpathians walnuts could be found in a wild\r\nstage; and of course domesticated walnuts flourish in every Ukrainian\r\norchard from the northern slopes of the Carpathians up to the southern\r\nbanks of the Pripet River, and all over Ukraine as far as the Don. But\r\nthere they could not be found in a wild form.\r\n\r\nWalnuts in such countries as Italy, Spain, France are probably of\r\nPersian origin.\r\n\r\nSince Canada was discovered by Cartier European settlers have many times\r\ntried to introduce the southern European walnuts in to the New World,\r\nbut without success. Only in California, along the Ocean's shore,\r\nEuropeans succeeded in acclimatizing some, as they think, \"English\r\nWalnuts\"; though in reality the California Walnuts are halfbreeds.\r\n\r\nIn Old Ontario the people enjoyed the local wild black walnuts,\r\nbutternuts and hickory. Up to the present English Walnuts are imported\r\ninto this Province.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1917 I settled in Toronto and found that even in the southern\r\npart of the Province, so rich in different fruits, no English Walnuts\r\ngrew there, I was amazed.\r\n\r\nIn my old home in the Ukraine walnut trees were as common as elms in\r\nOntario. And I have found that the Southern Ontario climate is warmer\r\nthan the climate of Kiev or Poltava regions in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nIt has seemed to me that English walnuts from the Carpathian region\r\nshould thrive well around Toronto.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Experiments\r\n\r\nIn my old home I have heard gardeners say: \"Where apples grow, walnuts\r\nwill grow there also.\" And around Toronto there I have seen nice apple\r\norchards producing splendid fruits. The Ontario apple trees withstood\r\nwinter colds well, and that fact encouraged me to try to plant English\r\nwalnuts from Ukraine in the neighborhood of Toronto. At the end of the\r\nFirst World War Ukraine revolted against the Russian Empire and at the\r\nsame time she was fighting for her independence with Poland.\r\n\r\nAt that time my father's family lived in the city of Stanyslaviv at the\r\nnorthern foot of the Carpathians. I asked my sister to send me as many\r\nlocal English walnut seeds by mail as she could. Giving such an order to\r\nmy sister I expected that the nuts would arrive not later than the end\r\nof October, just in time to be planted before the freeze up. This was in\r\n1921.\r\n\r\nI remembered from my boyhood that planting of English walnut seeds was\r\nsurrounded by some mystery. It seemed to me that people in Ukraine\r\nregarded it as a very difficult matter to cultivate walnut trees.\r\n\r\nBeing under such a notion myself I asked a horticulturist how long the\r\ngermination power of a walnut seed would last. He told me that it could\r\nprevail in a fresh walnut not longer than a week. He advised me in order\r\nto prevent walnuts from drying to dip them in melted parawax. Following\r\nthat information I wrote my sister to parawax the walnut seeds before\r\nsending them to Canada.\r\n\r\nOwing to the Polish-Ukrainian war at that time the shipment of the\r\nwalnut seeds got to Toronto not late in the Fall, as had been expected,\r\nbut in February when the farm land around Toronto was frozen. And the\r\nworst of it was my sister did not parawax the nuts!\r\n\r\nBeing sure the kernels were dead I allowed the children to do what they\r\npleased with them. But before they cracked the last one my wife advised\r\nme to plant a dozen of the nuts in our flower pots, as she said, \"for\r\nfun\". I did it. Other nuts the children destroyed, and in spite of my\r\nsorrow and anguish in two weeks the walnut sprouts came up in the pots.\r\nEveryone of them came up, proving that you do not need to protect walnut\r\ngermination by dipping the nuts into melted parawax.\r\n\r\nFrom the flower pots the walnut seedlings were transplanted that spring\r\nof 1922 into our city garden at 48 Peterboro Ave., Toronto.\r\n\r\nAt least a thousand of the kernels of several varieties were thus\r\ndestroyed and I was obliged to wait until another fall when the _Juglans\r\nregia_ nuts were sent again by my sister. They came also late in the\r\nwinter and were dry as pepper.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1923 I took the walnut seeds of the second shipment to\r\nthe farm of my friend Mr. M. Kozak located a couple of miles north of\r\nthe Scarboro Golf Club. There I soaked them in water in a tub for five\r\ndays and then planted in rows 1-1/2 ft. apart, row from row, and the\r\nnuts 6 inches apart nut from nut and two inches deep. In a couple of\r\nweeks nearly every nut produced a sapling. I kept them well cultivated\r\nthe whole summer, and in the Fall the seedlings were from six to eight\r\ninches tall. The nuts on the Kozak farm were of different varieties;\r\nsome were small, some large, some were round, some oblong, some\r\npaper-thin-shelled, some hard shelled; some varieties had sweet kernels,\r\nsome had a little slightly bitter taste, some were flat. According to\r\ntheir variety the bark of the seedlings, some of them at least, was\r\nshiny brown, while other varieties had their bark shiny dark green,\r\nlight gray, light green.\r\n\r\nNow I have known how to produce walnut seedlings. Then another worry\r\ncame--could the seedlings stand the Ontario winter? They had stood the\r\nwinter of 1925-28 very well. Only the tops of those were spoiled, which\r\nwere injured by buffalo tree hoppers.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that the regular Ontario caterpillars did not like the sap of\r\nthe English walnut foliage. But the worst enemies of the Carpathians was\r\nthe bacterial disease. The leaves and young shoots curled, turned black,\r\nbeing infested by the disease. In such a case the spraying is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquaintance with the Vineland Government Experimental Farm\r\n\r\nSomehow, but very soon after I started my experiments with English\r\nCarpathian Walnuts in Ontario, Mr. James Neilson, the nut specialist in\r\nthe Government Experimental Farm, Vineland, Ont. discovered me. By him I\r\nwas introduced to the late Mr. G. H. Corsan of Islington, Ont. who was\r\nknown as a prominent nut grower in Ontario. In the year 1924, when we\r\nmet the first time, Mr. Corsan already was interested in the culture of\r\nblack walnuts and butternuts, in hickories, pecans, hicans and filberts.\r\nSoon I transferred my English Carpathian walnut nursery to Corsan's\r\nplace at Islington. Mr. Corsan, with a great deal of enthusiasm\r\nbroadcasted my Carpathians all over the American continent, but under\r\ndifferent names: English Walnuts, Persian, Russian, Carpathian, etc.\r\nSoon we were joined by a third walnut enthusiast Mr. L. K. Davitt, a\r\nteacher in a Toronto High School.\r\n\r\nProf. C. T. Currelly the Founder and at that time the Director of the\r\nRoyal Ontario Museum of Archeology in Toronto, also became interested in\r\nmy walnut experiments. Then later on some other prominent Torontonians\r\nfollowed us and the Nut Growers Society of Ontario was organized.\r\n\r\nAmericans also became interested in the Carpathian walnuts. First among\r\nthem was a graduate from Cornell University, a farmer near Ithaca, N.\r\nY., Mr. Samuel Graham. Mr. George Slate of the Geneva Experiment Station\r\nwas one of the first Americans who early got interested in the\r\nCarpathians.\r\n\r\nThere in the States is the Northern Nut Growers Association. Following\r\nMr. Corsan I also became a member of the Association.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Research in English Walnuts in Ukraine\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1924 until 1936 I spent most of my time as a Presbyterian\r\nmissionary in Western Ukraine, which was then under Polish occupation.\r\nFrom time to time I used to come to Canada on furlough. Every time,\r\ncoming from Ukraine, I brought also a box or more of Carpathian English\r\nWalnuts for planting.\r\n\r\nThen I liked to tell Dr. Palmer, the Director of the Vineland Government\r\nExperimental Farm about my research in walnuts in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nIn Western Ukraine my headquarters were in the city of Kolomyja,\r\nProvince of Galicia, at the foot of the Eastern Carpathians. Thus I was\r\nin the center of the culture of the Carpathian walnuts.\r\n\r\nThough my circuit was very large (Provinces of Galician and Volynia) and\r\nthere was a time when I served 30 congregations, nevertheless I had a\r\nlittle time also to study the English Walnuts in their native\r\nenvironments.\r\n\r\nBefore starting the research in that country I decided for myself what\r\nin my conception should be the ideal English walnut. I have come to the\r\nconclusion that the nut should be of large size, thin shelled, its\r\nkernel well filled up, being of a pleasant sweet taste; inside of the\r\nnut there should be no partitions, thus allowing the kernel to roll out\r\nunbroken.\r\n\r\nThen I printed questionnaire blanks for each individual nut tree to be\r\nexamined. Beside the above mentioned questions I added:\r\n\r\nWhat is the name and address of the owner of the tree, and its location?\r\n\r\nHow old, tall and thick the trunk of tree is?\r\n\r\nHow many pounds of the nuts the tree yielded that year?\r\n\r\nIn what kind of soil does it thrive?\r\n\r\nWhat enemies attack it?\r\n\r\nWhat fertilizer, or manure, has been used in the particular case, or\r\nnone?\r\n\r\nIs there in the nuts, leaves and bark any sign of cross-pollination?\r\n\r\nRegarding the grafting and budding I found that the local nut-growers\r\nhad not the slightest idea how to go about it. They also did not care to\r\nprevent their walnut trees from cross-pollination.\r\n\r\nSoon I found that there in Galicia alone could be found several hundreds\r\nof varieties of Carpathian English walnuts. Anyway till 1935, I sent to\r\nToronto 200 varieties of the Carpathians.\r\n\r\nSome of those English Carpathian walnuts were 2-1/2 inches long, or five\r\nnuts to a foot; others were only one third of an inch. Some very small\r\nCarpathians produced nuts in clusters, like grapes. In some Carpathians\r\nit was possible to detect cross-pollination with Asiatic walnuts by\r\ntheir harder shells, by partitions, by the shape of nuts, by the\r\nconstruction of the leaves and their odor, and in some cases by the\r\ncolor of bark.\r\n\r\nBy kernels all the Carpathian halfbreeds are English walnuts, differing\r\ngroup from group by the taste. I remember that only in 1898 in the bourg\r\nof Loubni, and in 1933 in the City of Kolomyja I came across two trees\r\nwhich resembled our black walnut. In both towns some people used to live\r\nin America, and coming home they could bring with them some American\r\nnuts.\r\n\r\nIn the region around Kossiv I came across groves of American black\r\nwalnuts and butternuts. Those trees were planted there by the Austrian\r\nGovernment 75 or so years ago. Of course they did not cause all the\r\nhybridizing I mentioned above. Maybe the Asiatic nuts were brought in\r\nEastern Carpathians when the Tartar hordes crossed the mountains in the\r\nregion of Pokouttia (Kossiv) in the year 1242.\r\n\r\nNot far from Kossiv, westward, in the village of Kosmuch in the\r\nCarpathians 2500 feet above sea level I found English walnut trees of\r\nsmall size (15 feet tall, 6 inches thick) with light gray bark,\r\nproducing 2 inch long nuts of speary shape, like our Canadian butternuts\r\nbut of English Walnut shells and kernels. The kernels were tasty. There\r\nwas no question but that they were halfbreeds, English plus Mongolian\r\nnuts.\r\n\r\nThere in Kosmuch, not far from the historical Tartar Passage, through\r\nwhich in 13th century Ghengis Khan hordes invaded the Danube plains, in\r\nwinter the temperature falls to 45 degrees below zero. Owing to the\r\nhardiness of the strain and pleasant taste of the nuts I picked up about\r\n10 pounds of them to be tried in colder parts of Ontario, (and some of\r\nthem already are bearing north of Toronto and true to the type.)\r\n\r\nI called the nuts Hutzulian Pointies, as they grow in Hutzulia the\r\ncountry of the Ukrainian Mountaineers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1936. My last trip to Western Ukraine\r\n\r\nIn Ontario farmers were slow to grasp the idea of cultivating my\r\nCarpathian English walnuts. Either they did not believe the English\r\nwalnuts could thrive in this Province, or waited till my trees would\r\nstart to bear. Nevertheless some thousand of my seedlings were planted\r\nhere and there all over Ontario and smaller quantities in the Maritime\r\nProvinces, Manitoba and Alberta. The late Sir Wm. Mulock hired Mr.\r\nCorsan to graft with the Carpathian scions tops of many of his black\r\nwalnut trees in Orillia, Ont. Fred Gaby, the engineer who built the\r\nOntario Hydro, ordered through me from Ukraine 50 to 12 feet tall\r\nCarpathians of bearing age and planted them on 10 acres near Cooksville.\r\nOnt. Prof. Currelly has bought 25 acres near his estate west of Pt.\r\nHope, Ont. for my use in experimental work. The late Col. McAlpyne\r\nplanted one thousand of my yearlings on his estate at Fenelon Falls,\r\nOnt. Two young farmers, Papple Bros., in the Georgian Bay region also\r\nstarted an English Carpathian walnut orchard. In 1935 I moved my\r\nCarpathian walnut nursery from Islington to Prof. Currelly's estate, and\r\nMr. L. K. Devitt sold his lot of the trees through the Dominion Seed\r\nCo., Georgetown, Ont.\r\n\r\nIn the States, Mr. Carl Weschoke, a manufacturer in St. Paul, Minn., who\r\nin the year 1935 was elected the President of the Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation, also got interested in Carpathians. His son-in-law about\r\nthat time started a walnut nursery on their estate some 30 miles east of\r\nSt. Paul. That 1936 year Mr. Weschoke sponsored my expedition to\r\nNortheastern Poland (Northwestern Ukraine) to find the geographical line\r\nnorth of which English walnuts do not thrive in Europe.\r\n\r\nMy expedition was successful. I discovered that northward from the\r\nPripet River, which flows from west to east toward the Dneiper, English\r\nWalnuts could not be found. If I had come across there some English\r\nseedlings nearer to the Lithuanian boundary and the Baltic Sea shore,\r\nthey would have been planted there recently and not before the year\r\n1924.\r\n\r\nFarther north, though there English walnuts do not thrive, around the\r\nLake Peipus I came across filberts not as bushes but as large trees.\r\nEvery fall peasants in that district go in the woods and bring bags of\r\nfilberts for winter use.\r\n\r\nSuch filbert trees I found also in the Carpathian mountains near the\r\nUkrainian settlement of Vizhnytza in the Province of Bukovina.\r\n\r\nWest of the town of Sarny and south of the Pripet I came across a grove\r\nof 18 ancient English walnut trees. In the year 1648 when Ukrainian\r\nHetman Bohdan Khmelnytzky led a war against Poland those trees already\r\nwere 70 years old, and they still were bearing in 1936 when I visited\r\nthat region. Indeed their limbs were broken and they presented a sad\r\nsight, but they proved how long the Ukrainian English walnut could live.\r\nThe seeds of those ancient trees I also shipped to Mr. Weschcke. Beside\r\nthat I brought to my sponsors thousands of selected walnut seeds,\r\nseedlings and scions.\r\n\r\nMy English Carpathian walnut tree in the back yard of 48 Peterboro Ave.\r\nToronto, Ont., being planted out there from the pot in the spring of\r\n1922 started to produce nuts in 1929. The nuts were exactly to the type:\r\noblong, pointy, inch and a half long, the shell semi-hard, partitions\r\nlarge, the kernel of pleasant taste. It started to produce female bloom\r\nwhen it was 4 years old, but till 1929 there were no catkins of male\r\nbloom.\r\n\r\nThe crop of the nuts, that year and following years was usually carried\r\naway by marauding black squirrels.\r\n\r\nOther people who got from us the Carpathian English walnut seedlings\r\nreported that their plants also started to bear the seventh year or\r\naround that. But the Papple Bros. reported that they had a case when a\r\nseedling produced by them straight from the Carpathian walnut bore a nut\r\nin the second year of its life. On the other hand there were cases\r\nwhere some Carpathian English seedlings, as well as grafted ones, still\r\nproduce no nuts though they are 15 years old and over.\r\n\r\nI think the cause lies in the soil. On the gravelly hills over Ithaca,\r\nN. Y. Carpathian walnuts are slow to bear, even being grafted. The\r\nundersoil in the valleys 6 miles north of Pt. Hope, Ont. is not\r\nfavorable, not only for English walnuts but even for native black\r\nwalnuts, though very favorable to hickories.\r\n\r\nOn another hand, north-east of Toronto and near Unionville at the place\r\ncalled Hagerman Cornor on the farm of Mr. M. Artymko there is an orchard\r\nof 27 Crath's Carpathian English walnuts over 18 years old, each\r\nfruiting now every year. The trees are 25 feet tall, 5-6 inches thick,\r\nsituated on a knoll of clay, well drained soil, lying open toward the\r\nnorthwest. When the trees were younger they were subject to attacks of\r\nthe bacterial disease and their barks were cracked by frost. Now the\r\ntrees are in nice shape, no trace of the bacterial disease injuries and\r\nthe frost's scars disappearing. Some of those trees produced a bushel of\r\nthe nuts each.\r\n\r\nAmong Artymko's trees there is a tree bearing the walnut of giant type,\r\nand the tree--Hutzulian Pointie. The success of the Artymko's farm lies\r\nprobably in the soil and its high elevation.\r\n\r\nThere in Toronto Mr. T. H. Barrister, has in his backyard two Carpathian\r\nEnglish Walnuts, producing nuts of the giant size--five nuts to a foot.\r\nThe bacterial disease had touched them slightly, and the tree never has\r\nbeen sprayed.\r\n\r\nWe should expect that the Ontario Agricultural College at Guelph would\r\nfind out what is the best soil for English walnuts and what fertilizer\r\nto be applied for them. Chicken wire fences should protect the walnut\r\norchard from squirrels and the trees should be sprayed against bacterial\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nAbout walnut trees bearing and fertilizer--let us return to their native\r\nabode in the Carpathians. There in the village of Peestynka I have come\r\nacross a large English walnut tree 40 feet tall and about 36 years old\r\nwhich, as I was informed by the people there, never fruited till the\r\nFirst World War. During the war an Austrian horse squadron had put a\r\nstall around the tree. The horses well manured the soil around there and\r\nsince that time the tree was bearing nuts regularly and abundantly when\r\nI saw it in 1936.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Last Success!\r\n\r\nThe year 1951 should be regarded as the final establishing of the\r\nculture of the Carpathian English walnuts in Ontario. The three decades\r\nof experimentation have passed leaving a splendid result. The fact is\r\nestablished that the Carpathian English walnuts have become aclimatized\r\nin South Ontario. This fall I had an opportunity to examine my walnut\r\ntrees at many points in the Province. Everywhere I have seen the tree\r\nbearing. In Toronto in many a backyard, in Thorold South, in Welland, in\r\nPort Colboren, in Islington, near Port Hope on Prof. Currelly's estate,\r\naround Scarboro, Ont. and so on, the Carpathians are in good shape and\r\nall are bearing.\r\n\r\nThe more the trees mature, the better they look. On the average they are\r\n20 years old, 20 feet tall and 6 inches thick.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1951 in Ontario was more cloudy than usual, and it caused\r\nthe Carpathian walnuts in this Province to turn out smaller than their\r\nsize, should be about one quarter smaller.\r\n\r\nThe people who knew Carpathian English walnut trees in Galicia agree\r\nthat in Ontario the Carpathians grow more slowly than they do in their\r\nnative land.\r\n\r\nIt is not in Ontario, but on the University Farm at Madison, Wisconsin,\r\none of our Carpathian trees is nearly 40 feet tall and bearing. In\r\nGalicia I had seen many a Carpathian walnut tree as high as 60 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolish Government Interested in My Activity\r\n\r\nDuring the time of my activities, in the town of Kessiv, there used to\r\nlive a famous physician, Dr. Tarnawski. Outside of his clinics he was\r\nmuch interested in the welfare of the country. My activities could not\r\nbe hidden from his sight. \"What does that \"American\" see in our nuts?\r\nAre there in America no nuts?\" he asked. Soon I was introduced to him.\r\nIt was in the fall of 1934. He was not well and in bed at that time. He\r\nliked to talk with me about the walnut culture and wished to know why I\r\nwas collecting the nuts, scions and seedlings for Canada. And then it\r\nseemed to him impossible that there in Ontario and the northeastern\r\nstates English walnuts were not yet cultivated. Then I turned his\r\nattention to the fact that in Poland they know little about their own\r\ntrees. My challenge awoke him to activity, and through his intervention\r\nStarosta, the county governor, planted the first twenty-five acres with\r\nwalnut seedlings along the south side of the highway leading from Kessiv\r\nto the town of Kooty.\r\n\r\nDr. Tarnawski wrote also an article to a horticultural magazine on\r\nEnglish walnuts on what he learned from me.\r\n\r\nWhen in the fall of 1936 I was going back to my home in Toronto, Dr.\r\nTarnawski wrote about me to the Department of Agriculture in Warsaw\r\nintroducing me to the minister. I had an opportunity to give a talk on\r\nthe Carpathian English walnuts in the presence of many horticulturists\r\nin the Government Experimental Farm at Skieerniewice near Warsaw.\r\n\r\nLate in 1936 I came back to Canada and till the Second World War\r\ncontinued to cultivate the Carpathian walnuts and other horticultural\r\nmaterial brought by me from Western Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe Second War cut me off from my field in Europe.\r\n\r\nA decade and a half has passed. The Carpathians have been acclimatized,\r\nhave grown, and have been bearing nuts in Ontario. When such success has\r\nbeen achieved, it seems that there in Canada all the enterprise is\r\nforgotten. Of course, the Carpathian walnuts could not advertise\r\nthemselves--they are \"dumb critters.\"\r\n\r\nIn the States the situation with the Carpathians is entirely different.\r\nInterest in them is growing steadily, and as I said previously the\r\nAmerican nurseries have already put the Carpathians on the broad market.\r\n\r\nIn 1950 at the annual meeting the Northern Nut Growers Association made\r\nme an Honorary Member of the Association.\r\n\r\nIn 1951 the Association held a contest and the \"Crath\" Carpathians won\r\nmost of the prizes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCulture of Crath's Carpathian English Walnut Trees\r\n\r\n1. _Propagation by seeds_\r\n\r\nPick up the largest and heaviest nuts from a certain tree. Dry them in a\r\nwindy place, but not in the sun. Gather the nuts into a jute bag and\r\nhang for the winter in a dry and cold place protected from squirrels.\r\n\r\nAround May 14th put the nuts into a vessel with lukewarm water, soak\r\nabout one week.\r\n\r\nPrepare a bed of rich soil manured previously with horse manure. The\r\nland should not be of a wet kind. Plant the nuts in rows, 6 inches nut\r\nfrom nut, and two feet, row from row. Protect your nursery from\r\nsquirrels.\r\n\r\nIn a week or two the nuts should come up.\r\n\r\nKeep the nursery free from weeds. It will protect the seedling from the\r\nbuffalo tree hoppers. If the signs of the bacterial disease are detected\r\nspray the seedlings at once.\r\n\r\nFor the first winter leave the seedlings as they are in the field. The\r\nnext spring dig them up, every one. Cut off the leading root of each\r\nplant and transplant the seedlings again in rows a foot apart seedling\r\nfrom seedling and two feet row from row.\r\n\r\nThe amputation of the leading root causes the seedling to grow up\r\ninstead of down and will make them start to bear nuts earlier.\r\n\r\nIn Europe instead of cutting off the walnut seedling's main roots they\r\nput under them a flat stone, or start in an earthen pot.\r\n\r\nThe next spring the walnut seedlings are ready for the permanent\r\nplanting. Being permanently transplanted they should be cultivated at\r\nleast two or three years.\r\n\r\nWhitewash the walnut trunks in the late fall to protect bark from\r\nbursting by the winter sun. Put a screen around the trunks to protect\r\nthem from mice and rabbits. Though, if a walnut is gnawed by rodents do\r\nnothing about it, the tree will produce a stalk--a new one--from the\r\nroot.\r\n\r\n2. _Propagation by Grafting_\r\n\r\nTake Canadian black walnut seedling, one or two years old early in the\r\nspring, if you have a greenhouse and can graft them one inch above the\r\nroot line, tie up with raffia, cover with melted parawax and put in\r\nboxes covering each row with light soil mixed with the moss. After 20th\r\nof May when the danger of frost is over transplant in your nursery.\r\n\r\nThe grafting of walnuts should be called a barking method. Cut off the\r\nupper part of the stock horizontally. Split the bark with your grafting\r\nknife as much as needed and lift up the bark as far as the wood and\r\ninsert the scion. Tie up with raffia and do the rest as said previously.\r\n\r\nThe top grafting on the large Canadian black nuts gives good results\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n3. _Budding_\r\n\r\nWe bud the walnuts in the middle of August. Regular \"T\" cut has to be\r\ndone, the bud put in and wrapped with raffia. Then it should be covered\r\nwith parawax and left for a couple of weeks. After that time the\r\nbudding should be examined and the raffia removed. If the leaf by the\r\nbud remains green it indicates that the grafting is successful.\r\n\r\nThe next spring, cut off the upper part of the stalk about two feet over\r\nthe bud. You will tie up to it the budded shoot, which by the fall might\r\nbe up to 6 feet high.\r\n\r\nSpraying and cultivating is required as has been said above.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that the budded plant in its first year continues to\r\ngrow deep into fall and in many cases its upper part does not harden\r\nwell, wrap the budding with straw for winter.\r\n\r\n4. _Harvesting_\r\n\r\nIn the Carpathian Mountains when they gather the walnuts in the fall\r\nthey mash them down with a very long and quite thin hazel sticks. Doing\r\nthat they beat off the thin tops of the walnut branches. They say such\r\nan operation causes a better crop of the nuts next season.\r\n\r\n5. _Giant Walnuts and their problems_\r\n\r\nSome giant walnuts on the same tree have sometimes small kernels or\r\nwithered ones. In the Carpathian Region they do not know what to do with\r\nsuch a problem.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that we in Canada have to solve it. Maybe it is because\r\nof the bacterial disease, or it may be a lack of the proper fertilizer.\r\n\r\nIn Warsaw I have seen the giant walnuts sold not being dried.\r\n\r\n6. _Reforestation with the Carpathian Walnuts_\r\n\r\nCrath's Carpathian English walnuts could produce for Canada a very\r\nvaluable forest and in shorter time than other trees do. We should\r\nalways remember that in the Caucasian Mountains there are huge walnut\r\nforests. Some trees are of primeval age. Before the First World War\r\nEnglish buyers often paid a Caucasian farmer from 5,000 to 10,000 rubles\r\nfor a tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nWalnut Wine\r\n\r\nThere in the Town of Kooty Mrs. Babiuk, a good wife of a local burgher\r\ntold me about the walnut wine as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In my girlhood in this region there raged an awful epidemic of cholera.\r\nMany people died. But those who drank the wine made of green English\r\nWalnuts did not die.\"\r\n\r\nThe recipe that she gave me is as follows:\r\n\r\nTake equal parts of walnuts in which the shells are not yet hardened,\r\nand the same quantity of sugar. Cut each green walnut in half a dozen\r\nparts, mix them with the sugar. In a couple of days the juice will be\r\nextracted by means of the sugar and ensuing fermentation which continues\r\nabout one month. In two months it is ready to be consumed.\r\n\r\nOn my return to Canada I made wine from the Canadian black walnuts. The\r\ncolor of the wine was dark brown and quite pleasant. It stops stomach\r\nache.\r\n\r\nAlso we should not forget the walnut oil and the use of walnuts in\r\nconfectionary.\r\n\r\n\r\nWalnut Candies\r\n\r\nTake equal quantities of walnut kernels and honey. Mix. Boil, watching\r\nthat the honey does not over-run. Mix with a wooden spoon. In half an\r\nhour cool to see if the honey has turned into taffy. If not, boil\r\nlonger. When it is ready put upon a wooden board, with a spoon. When\r\ncooled the candy is ready.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Mr. Crath died late December 1952]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNut Tree Plantings in Southeastern Iowa\r\n\r\nALBERT B. FERGUSON, _Center Point, Iowa_\r\n\r\n\r\nLast year on our return from the Nut Growers Assn. tour, Mr. Snyder and\r\nI stopped to see the Schlagenbusch Brothers and their nut plantings. We\r\nthought at the time that it would be profitable to the Association to\r\nhave a report on their work. Mr. Snyder and I went down a month ago to\r\nvisit them again.\r\n\r\nSidney and Carl Schlagenbusch live in the southeastern part of Iowa. The\r\nwalnut orchard is on high land overlooking the Mississippi River bottom.\r\nThe ground was formerly oak and hickory timber. Most of their other\r\nplantings are near the farm buildings which are just below the higher\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe first planting of the walnut orchard was made in 1928 and was\r\ncompleted 8 or 10 years later. It consisted of 205 trees. Later\r\nadditions have been made. There are about 325 grafted trees in the\r\norchard at present, most of them of bearing age. The trees are spaced 50\r\nfeet by 50 feet in staggered rows. Some of the branches are beginning to\r\ntouch. The diameter of the larger trees is 18 inches. The orchard is in\r\ngrass which is not grazed close. The larger portion of the orchard is\r\nthe Thomas variety. They have a selection of their own which was first\r\nin the Iowa contest a few years ago. I thought it outstanding, but they\r\nconsider it a little small.\r\n\r\nThe nuts are gathered in a wagon and run through a corn sheller, then\r\ncleaned in a device they made themselves. The nuts are then floated and\r\ndried. Over half of the crop is cracked and sold as kernels. They have\r\nbeen getting around a $1.20 per pound in Fort Madison. No crop to date\r\nhas exceeded a thousand dollars in value.\r\n\r\nThey also have several hickories and hybrids. The shellbark variety,\r\nWagoner, is outstanding--the best I've seen. It is large, thin shelled,\r\ncracks easily, and is of good quality. A small tree grafted on shagbark\r\nis bearing well. They have the common varieties of pecans, a few\r\nchestnuts, a few English walnuts, Japanese walnuts and hybrids. The\r\nWinkler Hazel has not been very productive with them.\r\n\r\nThey had several trees of Stabler, which were not satisfactory so they\r\ncut the trees off close to the ground and put 6 or 8 bark grafts in the\r\nstump. They saved the largest one as the main trunk and taking a graft\r\nor a large sprout from the opposite side of the stump, inarching it into\r\nthe main trunk two or three feet up. This prevents the wind from blowing\r\nthe graft off of the stump. It also makes it possible to utilize the\r\nstrength of the roots from the opposite side of the stump. They had\r\nseveral trees worked this way which are now of good size.\r\n\r\nIn addition to caring for their large farm, nut orchard and a choice\r\nherd of Hereford cattle, Carl has found time to do some breeding work\r\nwith Oriental poppies from which he has made some very choice\r\nselections. They have also worked with several other perennials. Sidney\r\nand Carl Schlagenbusch are true horticulturists by nature and are fine\r\nfolks.\r\n\r\nOn the way home from this recent trip, we stopped to see Corliss\r\nWilliams near Danville. His brother Wendell Williams, located the\r\nWinkler Hazel, before the first world war in which he served and never\r\nreturned. We saw a Persian walnut, 25 or 30 years old, in Mr. Williams\r\nfront yard. It was a U.S.D.A. introduction from Russia. It seems to be\r\nperfectly hardy, bears well and is of excellent quality. The shagbark\r\nhickories are plentiful in his locality. He has top-worked 200 or more,\r\nmany of them to Burlington, which is productive and fills well with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRockville as a Hickory Interstock\r\n\r\nHERMAN LAST, _Steamboat Rock, Iowa_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a nut-grower I am afraid I have been over-rated; I make my living\r\ntilling the soil and dabble in my nut grove only when I can find a few\r\nmoments to spare--in fact all I know about nuts and nut-grafting, I owe\r\nto my good friend, Edgar Huen. I shall always remember that balmy May\r\nmorning 25 years ago when Mr. Huen came over with a kit full of hickory\r\nscions, and suggested we go out in my pasture and do some grafting. In\r\nthat bag were Stratford, Rockville, Des Moines, Marquette, Hagen and\r\nMonahan.\r\n\r\nWe grafted all that day--that is Mr. Huen did the grafting and I watched\r\nhim. Today these trees are living monuments of our work.\r\n\r\nThe only tree of these varieties that has ever borne enough nuts to feed\r\na squirrel is the Stratford.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I have been doing a little grafting myself. I acquired a few\r\npecans for understocks but the only variety that was congenial with\r\npecan as far as I knew was Rockville, but it produced no nuts--it was\r\njust a nice tree to look at.\r\n\r\nOne spring my brother-in-law who lives just across the line in Missouri\r\nsent me some shellbark scions from a tree in his pasture. I grafted\r\nthese scions on a pecan and they took off like a house on fire. This\r\nvariety proved to be a rugged individual and bore every year but the\r\nnuts were no good--all cavities like a true shellbark.\r\n\r\nThen one spring morning I grafted some of these shellbark scions on\r\nRockville; the grafts took and I soon noticed a transformation. The\r\ngrafts had blended with the understock and the offspring was different\r\nfrom either parent. The best part of the new hybrid was that it bore\r\nabundantly and the nuts are of fine quality.\r\n\r\nTo those who have some young Rockville trees for top-working, I can\r\nfurnish a limited amount of scionwood of this shellbark which I have\r\nnamed my Super X, it being so rugged and hardy.\r\n\r\nTo me the grafting of trees is a noble work. Someone has said that he\r\nwho plants a tree is a true lover of his race and I don't know of\r\nanything that will live longer in the memory of our children and those\r\nwho follow in our footsteps than a row of hickories laden with nuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Fruitful Pair of Carpathian Walnut Varieties in Michigan\r\n\r\nGILBERT BECKER, _Climax, Mich._\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to tell you briefly my experience with the difficulties of\r\nPersian walnut pollination. It took 8 years before I got any nuts,\r\nalthough they had nutlets time and again! It was after I had Crath #1\r\nbearing, that all proceeded to fruit, and then heavier every year, until\r\n1951 when the freeze of November 1950 eliminated the nuts.\r\n\r\nCrath #1 has done so well that I feel it well worthy of being a\r\ncommercial prospect for us. The size and shape are so attractive. (The\r\naccuracy of the numbering was once questioned by Mr. Stoke, so I do not\r\nknow if it is the same No. 1 that others have had from Crath. This was\r\nnamed by Prof. Nielson. It definitely is not Broadview, as Stoke at\r\nfirst thought.)\r\n\r\nMy Crath #1 had over four bushels of hulled and unhulled nuts (as they\r\nare picked up, after shaking) this fall. It was grafted on black walnut\r\nin 1938.\r\n\r\nAt my folks' place I planted a grafted Crath #1, and a Carpathian \"D\",\r\nside by side. There are no other Persian walnuts near, and they have\r\nalways had nuts, since they started to bear. I feel that this is a\r\nproper combination. I do not know whether the blooming periods overlap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggested Blooming Data to be Recorded for Nut Tree Varieties\r\n\r\nJ. C. MCDANIEL, _Univ. of Illinois, Urbana, Ill._\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch experiences as Mr. Becker's (extracted from a letter to me) are\r\nwell worth knowing, and we need similar information for several years\r\nand at different locations, for all the promising Persian seedlings and\r\nnew varieties. I would suggest that all of us who have them flowering in\r\nour plantings (even if only one tree) make an effort in 1953 to record\r\nas much as possible of the phenological data on them. A form such as the\r\nfollowing might be used, for flowering, fruiting, and related data.\r\n\r\n Year: 19_____ Location: ____________________\r\n Data by: _______________ First freeze previous fall: (Date) _______________\r\n Minimum temperature previous winter: _____ deg.F. on (Date) _______________\r\n Last killing frost this spring (Date) ______________________________\r\n\r\n +---------+-----+-------+---------+--------+---------+----------+-----+-------+\r\n |Variety  |Age  |Date   |First    |End     |Date     |Nuts      |Yield|Remarks|\r\n |(or      |of   |from   |catkins  |of      |pistils  |harvested |     |       |\r\n |seedling |tree |new    |shedding |shedding|appear   |(date)    |     |       |\r\n |No.)     |or   |growth |(date)   |        |receptive|          |     |       |\r\n |         |graft|scion  |         |        |         |          |     |       |\r\n +---------+-----+-------+---------+--------+---------+----------+-----+-------+\r\n |1.       |     |       |         |        |         |          |     |       |\r\n +---------+-----+-------+---------+--------+---------+----------+-----+-------+\r\n |2.       |     |       |         |        |         |          |     |       |\r\n +---------+-----+-------+---------+--------+---------+----------+-----+-------+\r\n |3.       |     |       |         |        |         |          |     |       |\r\n +---------+-----+-------+---------+--------+---------+----------+-----+-------+\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder \"Remarks\" could be recorded such information as the distance and\r\ndirection to trees furnishing pollen in the period when a given variety\r\nhas sticky appearing pistils, the abundance of pollen shed, apparent\r\nwinter killing of catkins, etc. The list of items could be expanded, if\r\ndesired, but it is thought that those included here are among the most\r\nimportant in determining the potential performances of varieties and\r\nvariety combinations in specific climates. A compilation of such data\r\nfor a period of about three years, supplemented with data on the nuts\r\nthemselves, would be of very practical value as a basis for selecting\r\nvarieties most promising to plant or propagate. The same data form would\r\nbe applicable to other walnuts, hickories, pecans, and filberts, and\r\nperhaps to a lesser extent with chestnuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote on Chinese Chestnuts\r\n\r\nHARWOOD STEIGER, _Redhook, N. Y._\r\n\r\n\r\nMy earliest Chinese chestnuts are ripening. Stoke Hybrid is earliest and\r\nthe nuts are so attractive, too bad they are not better in quality. It\r\nis an exciting time here as there are always a few seedlings that are\r\nripening for the first time. Honan, which ripens later, has been one of\r\nmy best grafted trees. One of my seedlings has very large nuts, very\r\nearly ripening, nuts are now falling, and it is prolific, nearly every\r\nburr has from two to three large to very large nuts. The quality seems\r\ngood. We like the large nuts as they are easier to peel and we like them\r\nboiled and served as a vegetable. The boiled nuts keep well when frozen.\r\nI think this tree is superior to any of my grafted and named varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScott Healey--An Obituary\r\n\r\n\r\nScott Healey was born December 3, 1881, in Wheatley, Ontario, Canada,\r\nand came to Otsego, Michigan, in 1904. He married in 1908. Mr. Healey\r\nwas a chiropractor for a number of years.\r\n\r\nIn 1921, Mr. Healey and his cousin, Lewis Healey, formed the Healey &\r\nHealey Lumber and Coal Company, in Otsego, which they operated together\r\nuntil a few years ago, when Mr. Healey retired due to ill health.\r\n\r\nMr. Healey was a director of the State Savings Bank in Otsego for many\r\nyears. He was a member of the first Baptist Church in Otsego.\r\n\r\nHe became interested in nut culture while the late Professor James A.\r\nNeilson was nut specialist at the Michigan State College. Mr. Healey\r\nplanted a nut orchard of about eighty grafted nut trees in 1933, which\r\nProfessor Neilson helped him plan. Most of the trees were black walnut\r\nvarieties, chiefly Thomas. However, there were some Ohio, Stabler,\r\nAllen, Crietz, Stambaugh, Ten Eyck, and Rohwer trees. There were also\r\nsome filberts, several Chinese chestnuts, and some heartnuts he had\r\nraised from seed. One nice tree of the McCallister hican makes good\r\nshade, but has never borne any nuts. He did some topworking in a large\r\nblack walnut tree in the backyard, where he got a Persian walnut to\r\ngrow.\r\n\r\nMr. Healey was very much interested in nut culture, and had planned on\r\nhaving a nut grove for a hobby to keep him busy when he retired.\r\n\r\nMr. Healey joined the Northern Nut Growers Association in 1933. He and\r\nhis wife attended the Battle Creek meeting one year later. They also\r\nattended the Rockport, Indiana meeting in 1935, and the one at Geneva,\r\nNew York in 1936.--\"The rest of the time he couldn't go or was in too\r\npoor health to go.\"\r\n\r\nThey sold their home, with the nut planting, to a young couple, Mr. and\r\nMrs. Lewis Lovett, in 1948, moved into Otsego; and retired.\r\n\r\nMr. Healey died, January 18th, 1952 at their winter home in Port Richey,\r\nFlorida. Surviving are his wife, Mabel, and one son, Virgil.\r\n\r\n   GILBERT BECKER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Letter from Dr. W. C. Deming, the Only Living Charter Member of the\r\nAssociation\r\n\r\n\r\n   Northern Nut Growers Association,\r\n\r\n   Dear Old Friends:\r\n\r\nThe 42nd Annual Report has recently come to me. Think of it, the 42nd\r\nAnnual Report! How familiar to me are a great many of the names of the\r\nofficers and members! I can even recall the very features of many of\r\nthem. I am myself now ninety years old and practically house-bound.\r\nThough yesterday, a day almost like summer, I did take a taxi and a\r\ndrive through the park amid the brilliant foliage, with Miss Dorothy\r\nHapgood, who by the way is a member of our association a thing with\r\nwhich I may have had something to do. Recently I was in the Veterans\r\nHospital at Newington for a couple of weeks. The doctors called it\r\n\"_polycythemia_\", the direct opposite of \"_anaemia_\", did 10\r\nphlebotomies taking 5 pints of blood which they said they used for\r\ntransfusions on ward patients, much to my gratification. I now have in,\r\nor had put in me, a dose, of radio-active phosphorus P32 which, they\r\nassure me will be getting in its good work for the next three months.\r\nNothing like being up to date, even if valetudinarian.\r\n\r\nYou have made me Dean of the association. In the beginning Clarence Reed\r\nwas always back of me with his abilities and vast fund of information.\r\nAlthough I believe I am, by virtue of my office, exempt from dues and\r\nentitled to the annual reports, I wish my five children to be at least\r\nonce represented in the membership. I append their names and addresses:\r\n\r\nHawthorne, the eldest, is with the Gen. Electric Co. in New York. I\r\ndon't know what he does but presume that with the other New York\r\nmillionaires he is busy accumulating wealth. This hint may guide you in\r\nsoliciting alms for the association some day. His home is in Hamilton\r\nLane, Larien, Conn. But I don't know if he knows a nut from a lunatic.\r\nHe has two kids, one now preparing for Korea. God preserve him.\r\n\r\nBenton is already a member. He has a few acres in the town of Avon,\r\nConn. where, among the rocks and the native rattlesnakes and copperheads\r\nhe tells me he has Chinese chestnuts growing. Recently he got two of the\r\ncopperheads. He is an energetic chap. He rises at 4 a.m. and drives the\r\nseveral miles into Hartford where he broadcasts from 7 to 8, for\r\npeople's breakfasts, I suppose, and is released at 10 a.m. He has just\r\ncontracted for a television program once a week in New Haven.\r\n\r\nOlcott is a consul in the U.S. Embassy in Tokio, transferred from a\r\nsimilar position in Siam. If there is something you want from Japan I\r\nguess he is your boy. Mention my name! He has a lovely wife and three\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nUna King, my elder daughter, whose husband was killed in an accident,\r\ninterviews VIP's on the same radio station as brother Ben.\r\n\r\nJoan Howe (Mrs. Paul) and her husband, who is in a bank in New York,\r\nlive in my old home on Umpawaug Hill, Redding, Conn. She writes of\r\nhaving had a crop of black walnuts from one of the trees I planted. I've\r\nforgotten all the others there may be there. Nothing of value I guess.\r\nJoan has two daughters. Ben has a son and daughter.\r\n\r\nThat makes five children I'm responsible for and they have acknowledged\r\nthe eleven grandchildren for me. I want you to make four of my children\r\n(Ben is already ensnare) members of the association, for which I will\r\nenclose a check for $12.00 (if I don't forget.) (The many typing\r\nmistakes of this letter are due mostly to the age of the machine, not\r\nmine.)\r\n\r\nMy two sisters who live in our old home in Litchfield and who are close\r\nbehind me in years, recently sent me a handful of nice chestnuts,\r\nChinese, from a tree 40 feet or more high in our backyard. They have to\r\ndivide them, very unequally, with the squirrels. The only other\r\nnoteworthy trees in our little place are a few papaws. Asimina triloba,\r\ntoo shaded to bear. This fruit might be worthy of a little attention\r\nfrom the nut growers. The dictionary speaks of several other species of\r\npapaw.\r\n\r\nAny of you who have outgrown the labor of caring for nut trees might\r\nfind interest in mycology in which I found diversion and edibles for a\r\nwhile. Only beware the deadly Amanita and others of that ilk.\r\n\r\nI cannot adequately express to you my heartfelt joy at the prosperity of\r\nour association. For one thing the great increase in the membership, for\r\nanother the birth of three branch state associations, but above all the\r\nsuccess in the production of nuts. In my time we had mostly, if not\r\nentirely, the promising production of specimen nuts only. We had nothing\r\nlike the Jacobs Persian walnut with its imposing spread and its\r\nproduction of 200 pounds of nuts in one season; Mr. Kyhl's orchard with\r\nits many varieties of Persian walnuts; his success in grafting and his\r\nreporting of a tree which bears three or four bushels of heartnuts\r\nyearly; Mr. Best's 5,000 grafted pecan trees; Mr. Hirshi's chestnuts;\r\nthe splendid results of the Persian walnut contests; and the almost\r\nspectacular increase in the number of nurseries selling grafted nut\r\ntrees of many varieties. These facts, and many that I have not\r\nmentioned, make it certain that nut growing is now a firmly established\r\nand surely increasing industry. You may be sure that these facts give me\r\ngreat delight.\r\n\r\nSome years ago while I was in possession of a mind as good as it had\r\nbeen at any time, I did a little grafting of nut trees in a commercial\r\nway for people at their country places, and I had the nerve to charge\r\nthem fifty dollars a day. What's more I got paid and never got kicked,\r\nnor did I hear mutterings or see scowls. But then, you see, there was no\r\nother grafter, of the kind, around my part of the country. Almost a\r\nmonopoly and, of course, a wicked one. But here my mind goes blank. I\r\ncan't recall what luck I had with the grafting, nor can I recall the\r\nname of a single one for whom I did such work.\r\n\r\nI strongly advise every one of you to have a good book in which you keep\r\npersonal and geographic records of all your work with nut growing. All\r\nthe details are vividly in your mind now, but when you get to be ninety\r\nyou may find them, as I do, faded away and all washed up. Please go on\r\nwith the good work.\r\n\r\nSome more good friends have just taken me for a round trip to Litchfield\r\nwhere my little sister, who is 84, has just partly circumvented the\r\nsquirrels and by going out very early in the morning to the chestnut\r\ntree has succeeded in getting a good big double handful of chestnuts,\r\nnice big ones.\r\n\r\nShe also called to my attention a good-sized Persian walnut which she\r\nsays I once grafted on a black walnut and this year was quite well\r\ncovered with nuts which she says the squirrels cut off while green, and\r\nshe says they were helped by one of the black plumaged birds. Some time\r\nago she gave me one of the nuts and I tried to husk it with my knife.\r\nBut it was too immature. They would have matured this fall, I think but\r\nfor the pests.\r\n\r\n   _William C. Deming_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweepstakes Award in Ohio Black Walnut Contest\r\n\r\nL. WALTER SHERMAN, _Canfield, Ohio_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis I believe, is the third report to the Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation concerning the black walnut contest held in Ohio in 1946.\r\nThe first report was given soon after the close of the contest. During\r\nthe year following the contest (1947), I visited each of the ten prize\r\nwinning trees, photographing them, and getting as complete a case\r\nhistory of each as was possible.\r\n\r\nThis, the third report, concerns mainly the process used to determine\r\nthe winner of the $50.00 sweepstakes award given in 1951 for the best\r\nperformance of a black walnut tree for a five-year period. The owners of\r\nthe ten prize-winning trees in the 1946 contest were asked to report the\r\namount of crop harvested each year as well as to send in samples of the\r\nnuts for a cracking test.\r\n\r\nComplete data were recorded each year from the samples just as they had\r\nbeen for the 1946 contest. The average weight of nut, recovery of kernel\r\nat first cracking, total kernel content, and per cent of kernel content\r\nwere recorded.\r\n\r\nFrom these data tables and charts were compiled to make a visual\r\ncomparison between the various nuts. Walnuts other than the prize\r\nwinners were not excluded from this five-year competition and quite a\r\nfew were submitted. However, only one of them, the \"Chamberlin\" was of\r\nspecial merit and it was given a place on these charts. No samples or\r\ncrop records were received from the Davidson (sixth prize) and the\r\nJackson (tenth prize) nuts, and so they are not shown on all the charts.\r\nOne sample from the 1949 crop of Penn walnuts was lost to a pilfering\r\nsquirrel, and the 1949 data used on the chart for the Penn walnut was\r\ntherefore the average of all other samples of this variety. The weight\r\nof total crop harvested in 1949, however, is actual.\r\n\r\nTable No. 1 gives the average weight in grams of the sample nuts. The\r\nDuke, (first prize) was the largest nut of all, in 1945, averaging just\r\nover 27 grams; but the Orth, in 1948, averaged almost a gram more. The\r\nKuhn, which was the smallest of the eight nuts in 1946 and again in\r\n1950, was the largest nut in 1949, and its size in 1949 was exceeded\r\nonly four times by any of the other nuts during the contest. The nuts\r\nwere large in size during the off year when only a small crop was\r\nproduced and they were small when there was a heavy crop.\r\n\r\nIn table No. 2 the weight in grams of the kernel recovered on first\r\ncrack, secured without the aid of nut pick, is recorded. In this\r\ncomparison the Duke, because of large size, might be expected to be an\r\neasy winner and it was in 1946 and in 1950; but in 1948, though second\r\nin average weight of nut for that year, it was in fifth place in\r\nrecovery of kernel at first cracking.\r\n\r\nTable No. 3 records the average weight in grams of the kernels. Here the\r\nDuke, due largely to its size, is a consistent winner in all three years\r\nit produced nuts. However, in 1949, a small crop year for the Kuhn, the\r\nnuts of this variety were large and contained more kernel than the Duke\r\ndid in 1948 or in 1950.\r\n\r\nThe per cent of kernel in the nuts as recorded in table No. 4 is\r\ninteresting. The Burson, which was the smallest nut in 1947, had the\r\nhighest per cent of kernel and also had the highest total kernel content\r\nof any sample in that year. Evidently the per cent of kernel is higher\r\nin well-filled nuts and this is largely determined by the weather and\r\navailable food supply late in the season.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the numerical score of the various nuts, figured out\r\naccording to the T.V.A. score system, is given in Table No. 5. By this\r\nsystem, no variety had a consistent high score, but each varied greatly\r\nfrom year to year.\r\n\r\nThe nut characters studied so far in charts 1 to 5 inclusive have varied\r\nso much from year to year that any judgment based on these characters\r\nfor any one year could not be relied upon.\r\n\r\nWhat characteristic of a black walnut, then, can be used in evaluating\r\nit? In table No. 6 the percentage of the total kernel that is recovered\r\nat first cracking is given. Oliver and Penn show considerable\r\nconsistency in that they remain above 91 per cent in all samples, but\r\nlook at the Kuhn. It was perfect in 1950 but in 1948 only 65 per cent of\r\nthe kernel was recoverable in the first cracking and Duke was nearly as\r\nbad, varying from 69 to 98 per cent recovery.\r\n\r\nAfter careful study of these six charts, I am sure you will have to\r\nadmit that any judgment of a black walnut variety based on these\r\ncharacters only is none too dependable.\r\n\r\nThese are the nut characters that we have been using in our contest!\r\nSome further method of evaluation is needed! Individual nut characters\r\nalone are not enough. A good farmer is concerned in quality of his\r\nproduce but quantity is of more importance for financial success. The\r\nElberta peach well illustrates this. There are many peaches of better\r\nquality, but the Elberta peach is a prolific producer and this is one\r\nreason more Elberta peaches are raised than any other variety. Quality\r\nwithout quantity means little.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, the $50.00 sweepstakes prize was offered for the tree\r\nwith the best five-year record. The judges interpreted this to mean the\r\nmost pound of kernels produced that were recovered on first crack. Going\r\nback over the records, we find some trees have been much more productive\r\nthan others.\r\n\r\nAt first it would seem unfair to compare the crop from trees of\r\ndifferent size and age, but this time luck was with the judges. Take a\r\nlook at Table No. 7 which gives the ages and sizes of the trees. There\r\nis not too much difference in size or age to make reasonable comparisons\r\npossible. However, it should be clearly understood that only trees of\r\nthe same age growing in the same orchard and receiving the same care can\r\nbe accurately compared. The trees we are dealing with were in different\r\nlocalities, with vast differences in soil conditions, air drainage,\r\nclimate, etc.\r\n\r\nTable No. 7 gives the total production for the five-year period for each\r\ntree, in bushels, the total amount of kernel as well as the amount of\r\nkernel recovered at first cracking. Only five trees had produced over\r\nfour bushels of nuts each during the five year period.\r\n\r\nThe Oliver tree produced 1.8 bushels and 25 pounds more kernels than the\r\nPenn tree. The Kuhn tree, though producing four bushels less nuts than\r\nthe Penn tree, did produce 4.1 pounds more kernels, with the same amount\r\nrecovered on first cracking from the nuts of each tree--almost a photo\r\nfinish for second place.\r\n\r\nThe sweepstakes award of $50.00 was therefore given to Mrs. Oliver\r\nShaffer, of Lucasville, Ohio, who sent in the Oliver entry.\r\n\r\nReferring to the case histories of these trees as written up in 1947,\r\nyou will find that the Oliver, Kuhn, Penn, and Orth trees were reported\r\non favorable sites, while the Duke and Burson were on very unfavorable\r\nones so that the above results are only what might have been expected.\r\nThe Orth tree, however, is in a favorable location and better production\r\ncould have been expected of it.\r\n\r\nTable 1.
