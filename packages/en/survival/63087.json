ZELEDÓN\r\n  OF\r\n  SAN JOSÉ, COSTA RICA\r\n\r\nTrue and steadfast friend for more than two-score years; host, guide,\r\nand companion on excursions among the glorious forests, magnificent\r\nmountains, and lovely plains of his native land; whose encouragement\r\nmade possible the completion of a seemingly hopeless task, this book\r\nis affectionately and gratefully dedicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe motive of this work is THE STANDARDIZATION OF COLORS AND COLOR\r\nNAMES.\r\n\r\nThe terminology of Science, the Arts, and various Industries has been\r\na most important factor in the development of their present high\r\nefficiency. Measurements, weights, mathematical and chemical formulæ,\r\nand terms which clearly designate practically every variation of form\r\nand structure have long been standardized; but the nomenclature of\r\ncolors remains vague and, for practical purposes, meaningless, thereby\r\nseriously impeding progress in almost every branch of industry and\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nMany works on the subject of color have been published, but most of\r\nthem are purely technical, and pertain to the physics of color, the\r\npainter's needs, or to some particular art or industry alone, or in\r\nother ways are unsuited for the use of the zoologist, the botanist,\r\nthe pathologist, or the mineralogist; and the comparatively few\r\nworks on color intended specially for naturalists have all failed to\r\nmeet the requirements, either because of an insufficient number of\r\ncolor samples, lack of names or other means of easy identification\r\nor designation, or faulty selection and classification of the colors\r\nchosen for illustration. More than twenty years ago the author of the\r\npresent work attempted to supply the deficiency by the publication\r\nof a book[1] containing 186 samples of named colors, but the effort\r\nwas successful only to the extent that it was an improvement on its\r\npredecessors; and, although still the standard of color nomenclature\r\namong zoologists and many other naturalists, it nevertheless is\r\nseriously defective in the altogether inadequate number of colors\r\nrepresented, and in their unscientific arrangement. Fully realizing his\r\nfailure, the author, some two or three years later, began to devise\r\nplans, gather materials, and acquire special knowledge of the subject,\r\nin the hope that he might some day be able to prepare a new work which\r\nwould fully meet the needs of all who have use for it. Unfortunately,\r\nhis time has been so fully occupied with other matters that progress\r\nhas necessarily been slow; but after more than twenty years of sporadic\r\neffort it has at last been completed.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments are due to so many friends for helpful suggestions\r\nthat it is hardly possible to name them all, or to specify the extent\r\nor kind of help which each has rendered; but special mention should be\r\nmade of Mr. LEWIS E. JEWELL, of Johns Hopkins University; Dr. R. M.\r\nSTRONG, of the University of Chicago; Prof. W. J. SPILLMAN, of the U.\r\nS. Department of Agriculture; Mr. WILLIAMS WELCH, of the U. S. Signal\r\nService; Mr. MILTON BRADLEY, of Springfield, Mass.; Dr. P. G. NUTTING,\r\nof the U. S. Bureau of Standards; Mr. P. L. RICKER, of the Bureau of\r\nPlant Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture; and Mr. J. L. RIDGWAY,\r\nof the U. S. Geological Survey. The late Professor S. P. LANGLEY, then\r\nSecretary of the Smithsonian Institution, was good enough to take a\r\nkindly interest in this undertaking and gave the author assistance\r\nfor which he is glad to make acknowledgment. More than to all others,\r\nhowever, is the author deeply indebted to Mr. John E. THAYER, of\r\nLancaster, Mass., and Señor Don JOSÉ C. ZELEDÓN, of San José, Costa\r\nRica, for aid so indispensible that without it the work could not have\r\nbeen completed.\r\n\r\nTo Dr. G. GRÜBLER & CO., of Leipzig, Germany, the author is under\r\nobligations for the gift of a nearly complete set of their celebrated\r\ncoal-tar dyes, which have proven quite necessary to the work,\r\nespecially in the coloring of the Maxwell disks on which the color\r\nscheme is based.\r\n\r\nThe reproduction of the plates has been a difficult matter, involving\r\nnot only expensive experimentation, but more than three years of\r\nunremitting labor. Vastly different from the ordinary lines of\r\ncommercial color work, the correct copying of each one of the 1115\r\ncolors of the original plates developed many perplexing and often\r\ndiscouraging problems, which were finally solved through Mr. A. B.\r\nHOEN'S expert knowledge of chemistry and pigments; the skill, industry,\r\nand patience of the firm's head colorist, Mr. FRANK PORTUGAL, and the\r\npersonal interest of both these gentlemen. It is, therefore, with the\r\ngreatest pleasure that the author's grateful acknowledgment is made to\r\nthe firm of A. HOEN & COMPANY for the satisfactory manner in which they\r\nhave fulfilled their contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   PAGE\r\n  PREFACE                                                             i\r\n\r\n  PROLOGUE                                                            1\r\n    Plan                                                              1\r\n    Color Names                                                       9\r\n    Color Terms                                                      15\r\n    Table of percentages of Component Colors in Spectrum Hues        21\r\n    Table of percentages of White and Black in Tone Scales           23\r\n    Table of percentages of Neutral Gray in Broken Colors            25\r\n    Table of percentages of Black and White in tones of Carbon Gray  25\r\n    Dyes and Pigments used in Coloring of Maxwell Disks              26\r\n    Alphabetical List of Colors represented on Plates                29\r\n    Colors of old edition Not Represented on Plates                  41\r\n    List of Useful Books on Color                                    42\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs stated in the Preface, the purpose of this work is the\r\nstandardization of colors and color nomenclature, so that naturalists\r\nor others who may have occasion to write or speak of colors may do so\r\nwith the certainty that there need be no question as to what particular\r\ntint, shade, or degree of grayness, of any color or hue is meant.\r\nTherefore, it is unnecessary to treat of the subject from any other\r\npoint of view; it will be sufficient to say that this work is based\r\non a thorough study of the subject from every standpoint, and that\r\npractically all authoritative works on the subject of color have been\r\ncarefully consulted.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN. —The scientific arrangement of colors in this work is based\r\nessentially on the suggestions of Professor J. H. Pillsbury for a\r\nscheme of color standards,[3] which have also been the basis of several\r\nother efforts toward the same end, as the plates in Milton Bradley's\r\n\"Elementary Color\" and educational colored papers, Prang's charts of\r\nstandard colors, Klinkseick and Valette's \"Code des Couleurs,\" etc.;\r\nbut while all these present a scientifically arranged color-scheme and\r\nmore or less adequate number of colors they all fail to supply a ready\r\nor convenient means of identifying and designating the colors—the\r\nprincipal utility of a work of this kind. It is in the latter respect\r\nthat the present work is believed to meet, more nearly than any other\r\nat least, this essential requirement, and in this consists whatever\r\noriginality may be claimed for it.\r\n\r\nThe \"key\" to the classification or arrangement herewith presented is,\r\nof course, the solar spectrum, with its six fundamental colors and\r\nintermediate hues, augmented by the series of hues connecting violet\r\nwith red, which the spectrum fails to show. If, with the red-violets\r\nand violet-reds thus added to the spectrum hues, the band forming\r\nthis scale be joined end to end a circle is formed in which there is\r\ncontinuously a gradual change of hue, step by step, from red through\r\norange-red and red-orange to orange; orange through yellow-orange and\r\norange-yellow to yellow; yellow through green-yellow and yellow-green\r\nto green; green through blue-green and green-blue to blue; blue through\r\nviolet-blue and blue-violet to violet; and violet through red-violet\r\nand violet-red to red—the starting-point—with intermediate connecting\r\nhues. In the solar spectrum, both prismatic and grating, but especially\r\nthe former, the spaces between the adjoining distinct colors are very\r\nunequal; therefore for the present purpose an ideal scale must be\r\nconstructed, so that an approximately equal number of equally distinct\r\nconnecting hues shall be shown. Distinctions of hue appreciable to the\r\nnormal eye are so very numerous[4] that the criterion of convenience\r\nor practicability must determine the number of segments into which the\r\nideal chromatic scale or circle may be divided in order to best serve\r\nthe purpose in view. Careful experiment seems to have demonstrated\r\nthat thirty-six is the practicable limit, and accordingly that number\r\nhas been adopted.[5] If the number of intermediate hues were equal\r\nin all cases there would, in this scheme, be five between each two\r\nadjacent fundamental colors of the spectrum; but a greater number of\r\nrecognizably distinct hues is obviously necessary in some cases than in\r\nothers; for example, spectrum orange is decidedly nearer in hue to red\r\nthan to yellow, and therefore the number of intermediates required on\r\neach side of the orange is different, being in the proportion of four\r\nfor the red-orange series to five for the orange-yellow, and similarly\r\nsix are required for the violet-red series, while four suffice for the\r\nblue-violet hues.\r\n\r\nThere is no known means by which we can measure the proportion of\r\ntwo or more _pigments_ in any given mixture, \"because color-effect\r\ncannot be measured by the pint of mixed paint or the ounce of dry\r\npigment;\"[6] but, fortunately, we have a very exact method, in the\r\ncolor-wheel and Maxwell disks, by which the relative proportions of\r\ntwo or more _colors_ in any mixture may be precisely measured. This\r\nmethod has been used in the painting of every one of the 1115 colors\r\nof the present work, by means of one disk to represent each one of the\r\nthirty-six colors (both pure and \"broken\"), together with a black, a\r\nwhite, and a neutral gray disk, the last being a match in color to\r\nthe gray resulting from the mixture of red, green and violet on the\r\ncolor-wheel;[7] the neutral gray disk, however, being used only for\r\nthe making of disks for the broken series of colors (′, ′′, ′′′, ′′′′,\r\nand ′′′′′) and for the scale of neutral grays (Plate LIII.) These\r\ncolored disks are slit on one side from center to circumference, and\r\ntherefore by interlocking two or more they may be adjusted so that\r\neither occupies any desired percentage of the whole area, which may be\r\nvery precisely determined by a scale of 100 segments shown on the outer\r\nedge of a larger disk on which the colored disks are superimposed. When\r\nconnected with the color-wheel and adjusted as may be desired, and then\r\nrapidly revolved, the two or more distinct colors resolve themselves\r\ninto a single uniform composite color, whose elements are shown, in\r\ntheir relative proportion, by the scale surrounding the disks.[8]\r\n\r\nThe scales (both horizontal and vertical) of the present work are\r\nall prepared directly from definite color-wheel formulæ, based on\r\ncarefully calculated curves; the thirty-six pure spectrum hues,\r\nrepresented by the middle horizontal line of color-squares on Plates\r\nI-XII (together with an equal number of intermediates represented by\r\nblank spaces), requiring a separate curve and consequently different\r\nrelative proportions of the two component colors for each series\r\nof hues—that is, the series from red to orange, orange to yellow,\r\nyellow to green, green to blue, blue to violet, and violet to red,\r\nrespectively; but the progressive increments of white in the scales\r\nof tints, black in those of shades, and neutral gray in the several\r\nseries of broken colors are exactly the same in every case. The first\r\nseries of Plates (I-XII) shows the pure, full spectrum colors and\r\nintermediate hues (middle horizontal line, nos. 1-72),[9] each with its\r\nvertical scale of tints (upward, _a-g_) and shades (downward, _h-n_),\r\nthe increments of white for the tints being 9.5, 22.5, and 45 per\r\ncent., respectively, those of black in the shades being 45, 70.5, and\r\n87.5 per cent. The remaining Plates show these same thirty-six colors\r\nor hues in exactly the same order and similarly modified (vertically)\r\nby precisely the same progressive increments of white (upward) and\r\nblack (downward), but all the colors are dulled by admixture of neutral\r\ngray; the first series (1′-72′, Plates XIII-XXVI) containing 32 per\r\ncent. of neutral gray, the second (1′′-72′′, Plates XXVII-XXXVIII) 58\r\nper cent., the third (1′′′-72′′′, Plates XXXIX-XLIV) 77 per cent.,\r\nand the fourth (1′′′′-72′′′′, Plates XLV-L) 90 per cent. The last\r\nthree Plates (LI-LIII) show the six spectrum colors[10] (also purple,\r\nthe intermediate between violet and red) still further dulled by\r\nadmixture of 95.5 per cent. of neutral gray, these being in reality\r\ncolored grays; to which are added a scale of neutral gray and one of\r\ncarbon gray, the former being the gray resulting from mixture of the\r\nthree primary colors (red 32, green 42, violet 26 per cent., which in\r\nrelative darkness equals black 79.5, white 20.5 per cent.); the latter\r\nbeing the gray produced by mixture of lamp black and Chinese white, and\r\nthe scale a reproduction of that in the author's first \"Nomenclature of\r\nColors\" (1886, Plate II, nos. 2-10). It should be emphasized that in\r\nall cases except the scale of carbon grays, only the disks representing\r\nthe middle horizontal series of colors (both pure and broken) have been\r\nused, in combination with a black and a white disk, respectively, to\r\nmake the colors of the vertical scales of tints and shades.\r\n\r\nThe coloring of a satisfactory set of disks to represent the thirty-six\r\npure spectrum colors and hues was a matter of extreme difficulty, many\r\nhundreds having been painted and discarded before the desired result\r\nwas achieved. Several serious problems were involved, the matter of\r\nchange of hue through chemical reaction of the combined pigments or\r\ndyes[11] (especially the latter) being almost as troublesome as that\r\nof securing the proper degree of difference between each adjoining\r\npair of hues. The method by which satisfactory results were finally\r\nsecured was as follows: First, six disks were colored to represent\r\neach of the fundamental spectrum colors, according to the author's\r\nconception of them.[12] These six disks were then placed against a\r\nsuitable background (a neutral gray), in spectrum sequence, with wide\r\nintervals for the accommodation of connecting series of disks, which\r\nwere then colored so as to represent an apparently even transition\r\nfrom one to the other. When this very difficult task had been done as\r\nwell as the eye alone could judge, each intermediate was then measured\r\non the color-wheel and the relative proportions (in percentages) of\r\nits two component colors recorded. After this had been done for all\r\nthe intermediate hues each series (the red-orange, orange-yellow,\r\nyellow-green, green-blue, blue-violet, and violet-red) was taken\r\nseparately and a curve constructed on cross-section paper from the\r\nrecorded ratios. These curves were found to be in all cases more or\r\nless irregular or unsymmetrical, but nevertheless were sufficiently\r\nnear correct to serve as a basis for a symmetrical curve; and after the\r\npoints out of proper line were suitably relocated the two component\r\ncolors were correspondingly readjusted on the color-wheel and each\r\nfaulty disk corrected (or a new one painted) until it exactly matched\r\nthe required combination. The scales representing the tints and shades\r\nof each color, and also the gray or broken colors were similarly\r\ndetermined by corrected curves.[13]\r\n\r\nBy the method adopted of running each of the thirty-six spectrum hues\r\nthrough a scale of tints and shades, and repeating the combination\r\nthrough several series modified by increasing increments of neutral\r\ngray, practically the entire possible range of color variation is\r\ncovered,[14] rendering it an easy matter to locate in the plates,\r\neither among the colors actually shown or in an intermediate space,\r\nany color which it is desired to match; and where short distinctive\r\nnames have not been found (their place being, tentatively, supplied by\r\ncompound names), as, necessarily, must often be the case, any color\r\nor intermediate between any two colors, either as to hue, tint, or\r\nshade, may be readily designated by the very simple system of symbols\r\n(numerals and letters) employed.[15]\r\n\r\nIn order to designate any color for which a satisfactory name cannot\r\nbe found, or one not represented on the plates, it is only necessary\r\nto proceed as follows: Suppose the color in question is nearest 1 on\r\nPlate I; say, for example, is intermediate in hue between 1 (spectrum\r\nred) and 3 (scarlet-red), or in other words if represented in color its\r\nposition would be in the uncolored space designated as no. 2; and in\r\ntone between the full color (middle horizontal line) and tint _b_. Its\r\ndesignation, therefore, is _2a_. Exactly the same method applies to any\r\nof the other blank spaces, as well as to the colors themselves, except\r\nthat in case of the broken colors the \"primes\" (′, ′′, ′′′, ′′′′, or\r\n′′′′′) are to be affixed to the hue number. First locate the _hue_,\r\ndesignated by number, then the _tone_, designated by lower case letter,\r\nthe full, pure colors of the middle horizontal row being designated by\r\nnumber alone.\r\n\r\nColor Names.—While it is true that the naming of colors as usually\r\nemployed has so little to do with the purely technical aspects of\r\nchromatology or color-physics that, as Von Bezold remarks[16] \"we are\r\nin reality dealing with the peculiarities of language,\" it is equally\r\ntrue that a collection of color standards designed expressly for the\r\npurpose of identifying and designating particular colors can best\r\nattain this object by the use of a carefully selected nomenclature.\r\nIn other words, the prime necessity is to standardize both colors and\r\ncolor names, by elimination of the element of \"personal equation\"\r\nin the matter. In no other way can agreement be reached as to the\r\ndistinction between \"violet\" and \"purple,\" two color names quite\r\ngenerally used interchangeably or synonymously but in reality belonging\r\nto quite distinct hues, or that any other color name can be definitely\r\nfixed. Various methods of handling the matter of color in zoological\r\nand botanical descriptions, etc., by the avoidance of color names and\r\nsubstitution therefor of symbols, numerals, or mechanical contrivances\r\n(as color-wheel and spectrum analyses, color-spheres, etc.) have been\r\ndevised but all have been found impracticable or unsatisfactory.\r\nThe author has taken the trouble to get an expression of opinion in\r\nthis matter from many naturalists and others, and the preference for\r\ncolor-names very greatly predominates; consequently, whenever it has\r\nbeen possible to find a name which seems suitable for any color in\r\nthis work it has been done, leaving as few as possible unnamed, and\r\nfor these some other means must be devised for their designation. (See\r\npage 8). The selection of appropriate names for the colors depicted on\r\nthe Plates has been in some cases a matter of considerable difficulty.\r\nWith regard to certain ones it may appear that the names adopted are\r\nnot entirely satisfactory; but, to forestall such criticism, it may be\r\nexplained that the purpose of these Plates is not to show the color\r\nof the particular objects or substances which the names suggest, but\r\nto provide appropriate, or at least approximately appropriate, names\r\nfor the colors which it has seemed desirable to represent. In other\r\nwords, certain colors are selected for illustration, for which names\r\nmust be provided; and when names that are exclusively pertinent or\r\notherwise entirely satisfactory are not at hand, they must be looked\r\nup or invented. It should also be borne in mind that almost any object\r\nor substance varies more or less in color; and that therefore if\r\nthe \"orange,\" \"lemon,\" \"chestnut\" or \"lilac\" of the Plates does not\r\nexactly match in color the particular orange, lemon, chestnut or lilac\r\nwhich one may compare it with, it may (in fact does) correspond with\r\nother specimens. Without standardization, even if arbitrary, color\r\nnomenclature must, necessarily, remain in its present condition of\r\nabsolute chaos. Even the standard pigments are not constant in color,\r\npractically every one of them being subject to more or less variation\r\nin hue or tone, different samples from the same manufacturer sometimes\r\nvarying to the extent of several tones or hues of the present work;\r\nindeed, in every case where two or more samples of the same color\r\nhave been compared it has been found that no two are exactly alike,\r\nthe difference often being very great. For example: Of five samples\r\nof \"vandyke brown\" only two are approximately similar, each of the\r\nother three being widely different, not only from one another but from\r\nthe other two, one being a blackish brown, another reddish brown, the\r\nthird a yellowish orange-brown. Of eleven samples of \"olive\" no two\r\nare closely similar, the color ranging from a shade of dull (grayish)\r\nblue-green to orange-brown, dark brownish gray, and light yellowish\r\nolive; and the same or nearly the same degree of variation is seen\r\nin absolutely every color examined, showing very clearly the utter\r\nworthlessness of color names unless fixed or standardized.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain as many color names as possible for standardization\r\nit has been necessary to draw from all available sources. Several\r\nthousand samples of named colors have therefore been collected, and\r\nfor convenience of reference and comparison gummed to card catalogue\r\ncards, with the name, source, and other data thereon. These include\r\nthe colors from many standard works, among them Werner's \"Nomenclature\r\nof Colours\" (Syme's edition, 1821), Hay's \"Nomenclature of Colours\"\r\n(1846), Ridgway's \"Nomenclature of Colors\" (1886), Saccardo's\r\n\"Chromataxia\" (1891), Mathews' \"Chart of Correct Colors of Flowers\"\r\n(American Florist, 1891), Willson and Calkins' \"Familiar Colors,\"\r\nOberthur and Dauthenay's \"Repertoire des Couleurs\" (1905), Leidel's\r\n\"Hints on Tints\" (1893), \"Lefévré's Matieres Colorantes Artificiales\"\r\n(1896), the Standard Dictionary chart of \"typical colors,\" the\r\neducational colored papers of Milton Bradley and Prang, and many\r\nothers; and besides these practically all of the artists' oil, water,\r\nand dry colors, manufactured by Winsor and Newton, F. Schoenfeld and\r\nCo., Charles Roberson and Co., George Rowney and Co., Madderton and\r\nCo., R. Ackermann and Co., Bourgeois, Binant, Chenal, Le Franc, Devoe,\r\nRaynolds, Osborne, Bradley, Hatfield and others; also the coal-tar or\r\naniline dyes of Dr. G. Grübler & Co., Continental Color and Chemical\r\nCo., and Henry Heil Chemical Co., and the well known Diamond Dyes;\r\nchromo-lithographic inks, embroidery silks, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe material from which to select suitable color names was greatly\r\naugmented, almost at the last moment, from two sources, as follows: (1)\r\nA very large collection of color-samples (unfortunately mostly unnamed)\r\ncollected and mounted on cards by Mr. Frederick A. Wampole, a talented\r\nyoung artist, to whom was delegated, by a Committee of the American\r\nMycological Society, the task of preparing a nomenclature of colors\r\nbased upon spectroscopic determinations, but which, unfortunately,\r\nthe untimely death of Mr. Wampole prevented from progressing beyond\r\nthe accumulation of this collection. For the use of this material I\r\nam indebted to the courtesy of Dr. Frederick V. Coville, Botanist of\r\nthe U. S. Department of Agriculture, and Mr. P. L. Ricker, Assistant\r\nBotanist, Bureau of Plant Industry, in the same Department. (2) A\r\nsplendid collection of colored Japanese silks, taffetas, velvets, and\r\nother dress goods, kindly sent me by Mr. C. H. Hospital, of the silk\r\ndepartment of the firm of Woodward and Lothrop, Washington, D. C. The\r\nvery large number of colors represented in this collection are all\r\nnamed and have afforded a considerable number of the names adopted in\r\nthe present work.\r\n\r\nFor obvious reasons it has, of course, been necessary to ignore many\r\ntrade names, through which the popular nomenclature of colors has\r\nbecome involved in really chaotic confusion rendered more confounded\r\nby the continual coinage of new names, many of them synonymous and\r\nmost of them vague and variable in their application. Most of them\r\nare invented, apparently without care or judgment, by the dyer or\r\nmanufacturer of fabrics, and are as capricious in their meaning as in\r\ntheir origin; for example: Such fanciful names as \"zulu,\" \"serpent\r\ngreen,\" \"baby blue,\" \"new old rose,\" \"London smoke,\" etc., and such\r\nnonsensical names as \"ashes of roses\" and \"elephant's breath.\" An\r\ninspection of the sample books of manufacturers of fancy goods (such\r\nas embroidery silks and crewels, ribbons, velvets, and other dress-\r\nand upholstery-goods) is sufficient not only to illustrate the\r\nabove observations, but to show also the absolute want of system or\r\nclassification and the general unavailability of these trade names for\r\nadoption in a practical color nomenclature. This is very unfortunate,\r\nsince many of these trade names have the merit of brevity and euphony\r\nand lack only the quality of stability.\r\n\r\nIt has been difficult for the author to decide whether the standards\r\nof his original \"Nomenclature of Colors\" (1886) should be retained\r\nin the present work. Some of them are admittedly wrong (indeed,\r\ncertain ones are not as they were intended to be); besides, owing to\r\nthe method of reproducing the originals (hand stenciling) there is\r\nconsiderable variation in different copies of the book, one or more\r\nreprints, necessitating new mixtures of pigments, adding to this lack\r\nof uniformity.[17] Many persons, however, have urged the retention of\r\nthe old standards, on the ground that they have been used by so many\r\nzoologists and botanists in their writings during the last twenty-five\r\nyears that they have become established through common usage. This\r\nvery important consideration has induced the author to retain such of\r\nthe old standards as can be matched in the present work, even though\r\nsome of them do not agree strictly with either his own or the usual\r\nconception of the colors in question. An asterisk (*) preceding a color\r\nname indicates that the name in question is adopted from the older\r\nwork, the variation between different copies of the work requiring\r\nthe selection, in the new one, of a color representing as nearly as\r\npossible an average of the former.\r\n\r\nIn any systematically arranged scheme, unless the number of colors\r\nshown is practically unlimited, it will, necessarily, be impossible\r\nto find represented thereon a certain proportion of colors comprised\r\namong even a very limited number selected at random, or only roughly\r\nclassified. Hence many (thirty-six, or more than five per cent.) of the\r\ncolors shown in the old \"Nomenclature of Colors\" fall into the blank\r\nintervals of the present work, being intermediate either in hue or\r\ntone, or chroma, sometimes all. It is necessary of course to provide\r\nsome means for the correlation of these with the present scheme, which\r\nis done by the list on page 41, where the position of each is shown.\r\n\r\nThe question of giving representations of metallic colors in this\r\nwork was at one time considered; but the idea was abandoned for the\r\nreason that these are in reality only ordinary colors reflected from\r\na metallic or burnished surface, or appearing as if so reflected; the\r\nactual hue is precisely the same, though often changeable according to\r\nangle of impact of the light rays, and relative position of the eye,\r\nthis changeableness being sometimes due to interference.[18] Colors\r\nagain vary, without actual difference of hue, in regard to quality of\r\ntexture or surface; that is to say, the color may be quite lustreless,\r\nappearing on a dull, sometimes velvety surface, while again it may be\r\nmore or less glossy, even to the degree of appearing as if varnished.\r\nTo deal with these variations, however, requires simply the use of\r\nsuitable adjectives. For example: To indicate a color which has no\r\nlustre or brightness, the adjective matt (or mat) may be used, in\r\npreference to _dull_, which implies reduction in purity or chroma;\r\nother adjectives, appropriate in special cases, being velvety, glossy,\r\nburnished metallic, matt-metallic, etc.\r\n\r\nColor Terms.—No other person has presented so forcibly the urgent need\r\nfor reform in popular nomenclature nor stated so clearly and concisely\r\nits shortcomings and the simple remedy, as Mr. Milton Bradley, from\r\none of whose educational pamphlets on the subject[19] the following is\r\nquoted: \"The list of words now employed to express qualities or degrees\r\nof color is very small, in fact a half dozen comprise the more common\r\nterms, and these are pressed into service on all occasions, and in such\r\nvaried relations that they not only fail to express anything definite\r\nbut constantly contradict themselves.... Tint, Hue and Shade are\r\nemployed so loosely by the public generally, even by those people who\r\nclaim to use English correctly, that neither word has a very definite\r\nmeaning, although each is capable of being as accurately used as any\r\nother word in our every day vocabulary\"....\r\n\r\nCertainly one would expect that men of learning, at least, would employ\r\nthe broader color terms correctly; but some of the highest authorities\r\non color-physics habitually use them interchangeably, as if they were\r\nquite synonymous; and even the dictionaries, with few exceptions, give\r\nincorrect or \"hazy\" definitions of these terms. It is not strictly\r\ncorrect to say a \"dark tint\" or \"light shade\" of any color, because a\r\n_tint_ implies a color _paler_ than the full color, while a shade means\r\nexactly the opposite; and to say an \"orange shade (or tint) of red,\"\r\na \"greenish shade (or tint) of blue,\" a \"bluish shade (or tint) of\r\nviolet,\" etc., is an absurdity, for the term _hue_, which specifically\r\nand alone refers to relative position in the spectrum scale, without\r\nreference to lightness or darkness, is the only one which can correctly\r\nbe used in such cases.\r\n\r\nIndeed the standardization of color terms is almost if not quite\r\nas important, in the interest of educational progress, as that of\r\nthe colors themselves and their names; therefore, to make easy a\r\nclear understanding of the specific meaning of each, the following\r\ndefinitions are given:—\r\n\r\n_Color._—The term of widest application, being the only one which can\r\nbe used to cover the entire range of chromatic manifestation; that is\r\nto say, the spectrum colors (together with those between violet and\r\nred, not shown in the spectrum) with all their innumerable variations\r\nof luminosity, mixture, etc. In a more restricted sense, applied to the\r\nsix distinct spectrum colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and\r\nviolet), which are sometimes distinguished as _fundamental colors_ or\r\n_spectrum colors_.\r\n\r\n_Hue._—While often used interchangeably or synonymously with color,\r\nthe term _hue_ is more properly restricted by special application\r\nto those lying between any contiguous pair of spectrum colors (also\r\nbetween violet and purple and between purple and red); as an orange\r\n_hue_ (not shade or tint, as so often incorrectly said) of red; a\r\nyellow _hue_ of orange; a greenish _hue_ of yellow; a bluish _hue_ of\r\ngreen; a violet _hue_ of blue, etc.\r\n\r\n_Tint._—Any color (pure or broken) weakened by high illumination or\r\n(in the case of pigments) by admixture of white, or (in the case of\r\ndyes or washes) by excess of aqueous or other liquid medium; as, a\r\ndeep, medium, light, pale or delicate (pallid) _tint_ of red. The term\r\ncannot correctly be used in any other sense.\r\n\r\n_Shade._—Any color (pure or broken) darkened by shadow or (in the case\r\nof pigments) by admixture of black; exactly the opposite of _tint_; as\r\na medium, dark, or very dark (dusky) _shade_ of red.\r\n\r\n_Tone._—\"Each step in a color scale is a tone of that color.\"[20]\r\nThe term tone cannot, however, be properly applied to a step in the\r\nspectrum scale, in which each contiguous pair of the six distinct\r\nspectrum or \"fundamental\" _colors_ are connected by _hues_. Hence\r\n_tone_[21] is exclusively applicable to the steps in a scale of\r\na single color or hue, comprising the full color (in the center)\r\nand graduated tints and shades leading off therefrom in opposite\r\ndirections; or of neutral gray similarly graduated in tone from the\r\ndarkest shade to the palest tint. Each one of the colored blocks in the\r\nvertical scales of the plates in this work represents a separate tone\r\nof that color.\r\n\r\n_Scale._—A linear series of colors showing a gradual transition from\r\none to another, or a similar series of tones of one color. The first\r\nis a _chromatic scale_[22] (or scale of colors and hues) and in the\r\nplates of this work is represented by each horizontal series; the\r\nsecond is a _tone scale_, on the plates running vertically, growing\r\nfrom the full color, in the center, to a pale tint (at the top) and\r\na dark shade (at the bottom). For clearer comprehension of these\r\ntwo distinct scales, each plate of this work may be compared to a\r\nsheet of woven fabric; the chromatic scale (horizontal) representing\r\nthe warp, the luminosity or tone scale (vertical) the woof. A third\r\nkind of color scale is represented by adding progressive increments\r\nof neutral gray to any color. This is shown by the several series\r\nof Plates, of which the first (Plates I-XII, with colors numbered\r\n1-71) represents each step in the spectrum scale unmixed with gray,\r\nfollowed by five other series in which the same colors[23] are shown\r\ndulled by gradually increasing increments of neutral gray, the first\r\n(Plates XIII-XXVI, colors 1′-71′) containing 32 per cent., the second\r\n(Plates XXVII-XXXVIII, colors 1′′-71′′) 58 per cent., the third (Plates\r\nXXXIX-XLIV, colors 1′′′-69′′′) 77 per cent., the fourth (Plates XLV-L,\r\ncolors 1′′′′-69′′′′) 90 per cent., and the fifth (Plates LI-LIII,\r\ncolors 1′′′′′, 15′′′′′, 23′′′′′, 35′′′′′, 49′′′′′, 59′′′′′ and 67′′′′′)\r\n95.5 per cent. of gray, the last being in reality colored grays.\r\nFinally scales are shown (on Plate LIII) of neutral gray (in which\r\nall trace of color is wanting), and of carbon gray, a simple mixture\r\nof lamp-black and chinese white. It is not easy to find a suitable\r\nname for these scales of reduced or \"broken\" colors, but they may, for\r\npresent convenience, be termed _reduced_ or _broken scales_.\r\n\r\n_Full Color._—A color corresponding in intensity with its\r\nmanifestation in the solar spectrum.\r\n\r\n_Pure Color._—A color corresponding in purity with (or, in the case of\r\nmaterial colors, closely approximating to) one of the spectrum colors.\r\n\r\n_Broken Color._—Any one of the spectrum colors or hues dulled or\r\nreduced in purity by admixture (in any proportion) of neutral gray, or\r\nvarying relative proportions of both black and white; also produced\r\nby admixture of certain spectrum colors, as red with green, orange\r\nwith blue, yellow with violet, etc. These broken colors are far more\r\nnumerous in Nature than the pure spectrum colors, and include the\r\nalmost infinite variations of brown, russet, citrine, olive, drab, etc.\r\nThey are often called dull or neutral colors.\r\n\r\n_Fundamental Colors._—The six psychologically distinct colors of the\r\nsolar spectrum; Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Violet.\r\n\r\n_Primary Colors._—Theoretically, any of the spectrum colors which\r\ncannot be made by mixture of two other colors. According to the\r\ngenerally accepted Young-Helmholtz theory, the primary colors are\r\nred, green, and violet: orange and yellow resulting from a mixture of\r\nred and green, and blue from a mixture of green and violet. There is\r\nconsiderable difference of opinion, however, as to this question, and\r\nfurther investigation of the subject seems to be required; at any rate,\r\nauthorities fail to explain why red may be exactly reproduced (except\r\nas to the degree of luminosity) by a mixture of orange and violet,\r\nexactly as yellow results from mixture of red and green or blue from\r\ngreen or violet, green being, in fact, the only spectrum color that\r\ncannot be made by mixture of other colors.[24]\r\n\r\n_Chroma._—Degree of freedom from white light; purity, intensity or\r\nfullness of color.\r\n\r\n_Luminosity._—Degree of brightness or clearness. The relative\r\nluminosity of the spectrum colors is as follows: [Yellow (brightest)?],\r\norange yellow; orange; greenish-yellow, yellow-green, and green;\r\norange-red; red and blue (equal); violet-blue, blue-violet, violet.[25]\r\n\r\n_Warm Colors._—The colors nearer the red end of the spectrum or those\r\nof longer wave-lengths (red, orange, and yellow, and connecting hues)\r\n\"and combinations in which they predominate.\"[26]\r\n\r\n_Cool, or Cold, Colors._—The colors nearer the violet end of\r\nthe spectrum or those of shorter wave-length, especially blue and\r\ngreen-blue. \"But it is, perhaps, questionable whether green and violet\r\nmay be termed either warm or cool.\"\r\n\r\n_Complementary Color._—\"As white light is the sum of all color, if\r\nwe take from white light a given color the remaining color is the\r\ncomplement of the given color.\" When any two colors or hues which when\r\ncombined in proper proportion on the color-wheel produce, by rotation,\r\nneutral gray, these two colors each represent the complementary of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n_Constants of Color._—The constants of color are numbers which measure\r\n(1) the wave-length, (2) the chroma, and (3) the luminosity.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the terms defined above there are many others, for which\r\nthe reader is referred to the chapter on \"Color Definitions\" on pages\r\n23-30 of Milton Bradley's excellent and most useful book \"Elementary\r\nColor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF PERCENTAGES OF COMPONENT COLORS IN THE CONNECTING HUES OF THE\r\nCHROMATIC SCALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the relative percentages, in color-wheel\r\nmeasurement, of the two components in each of the hues connecting\r\nadjacent pairs of the six spectrum colors as represented on the\r\noriginal Plates of this work; together with an equal number of exact\r\nintermediates (not shown on the Plates), the latter in lower-case type\r\nand not indicated by symbols.\r\n\r\n  Number.

This originated in the\r\nfact that there seems to be no substance (pigment, dye, or fabric)\r\nwhich represents a true black, all reflecting more or less of white\r\nlight, and consequently producing shades which are dull or broken.\r\nThe difficulty is increased by the additional fact that any black\r\npigment mixed with almost any color falls short of even the color-wheel\r\nmixture in purity of hue in the resulting shades, owing to the very\r\nconsiderable amount of gray in all black pigments. Chromolithography\r\ncan be made to produce clearer and better shades of the pure colors,\r\nbut is distinctly objectionable for the purpose of a work of this\r\nkind owing to eventual oxidation of the oil or varnish with which the\r\npigments are combined in lithographic inks, causing a change of hue;\r\nreds becoming more orange, blues more greenish, etc., in course of time.\r\n\r\nWhile the absence (in large part) of pure chromatic shades is much\r\nto be regretted, the defect is not so serious, _from the standpoint\r\nof utility_, as might appear at first sight; for while saturated or\r\ndarkened pure colors are not uncommon in the animal, vegetable, and\r\nmineral kingdoms, more or less broken dark colors are infinitely more\r\nso; and since the latter are greatly increased in number by the defect\r\nmentioned the actual result is rather an advantage than otherwise.\r\n\r\nIt will doubtless be noticed that there is a conspicuous difference\r\nin relative darkness between shades of yellow and contiguous hues on\r\nthe one hand and corresponding ones of violet and adjacent hues on the\r\nother, as if the percentage of black in each were very different. This,\r\nhowever, is entirely the result of difference of luminosity of the\r\ntwo sets of colors, that of yellow being between 7000 and 8000 while\r\nthat of violet is only about 13;[28] for the percentage of black in\r\ncorresponding tones of the vertical scales is precisely the same for\r\neach color throughout the chromatic scale of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING PERCENTAGES OF NEUTRAL GRAY IN THE BROKEN COLOR SCALES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery Plate in each series of broken colors (′ to ′′′′′) contains\r\nexactly the same percentage of neutral gray in each color, the relative\r\namount increasing progressively in the several series, as shown in the\r\nfollowing table.

(The best substitute among pigments\r\nis a fine quality of _zinc yellow_, as Hatfield's.)\r\n\r\n=Hues between yellow and green.=—_Auramin_ washed with _light green_.\r\n\r\n=Green.=—_Auramin_ (very dilute) washed with _light green_. (The\r\nauramin should be applied first, because it \"sets\" or becomes fast\r\nquickly, while the light green does not, but is largely removed by\r\noverwashes of the yellow, thus rendering it very difficult to get the\r\ndesired hue.)\r\n\r\n=Hues between green and blue.=—_Methyl green_; the same washed with\r\n_light blue_ (Diamond Dye); for the hues nearer blue, _light blue_\r\nwashed with Winsor and Newton's _permanent blue_ or _new blue_ (the\r\nleast violet-hued of the artificial ultramarines).\r\n\r\n=Blue.=—_Light blue_ washed with _permanent blue_ or _new blue_.\r\n(Although the color is nearer that of the artificial ultramarines\r\nnamed, it is useless to apply the latter first, for overwashes of the\r\nlight blue merely sink through and darken the color without improving\r\nthe hue. A moderately saturated solution of the light blue should be\r\napplied first, and when this is dry covered with one or more rather\r\nthin washes of the permanent blue or new blue).\r\n\r\n=Hues between blue and violet.=—Winsor and Newton's _permanent blue_\r\nand some of the more violet-hued artificial ultramarines, the hues\r\nnearer violet washed with _crystal violet_ or _gentian violet_.\r\n\r\n=Violet.=—_Crystal violet._\r\n\r\n=Hues between violet and red.=—_Methyl violet 1b._ washed with\r\n_rhodamin b._; for hues nearer red, _rhodamin b._ with Devoe's\r\n_geranium red_ (dry) or _crocein scarlet b._\r\n\r\nWhile more or less similar in hue to rhodamin b., several other aniline\r\ndyes, as _acid fuchsin_, _rubin s._, _rosein_, _magenta_, etc., do not\r\ncombine satisfactorily with the violets, the mixture soon becoming dark\r\nor dull and none of them are quite as pure a purple or red-violet.\r\n\r\nIt is most important to remember that disks thus colored must be\r\ncarefully protected from light when not in actual use and _never_\r\nexposed to direct sunlight. The artificial ultramarines are, of course,\r\npermanent, and so, practically, are crocein scarlet, gold orange,\r\norange g., and auramin—that is to say, are not materially affected\r\nby the action of light except after very prolonged exposure, though\r\nthe last named undergoes a change of hue; but the green and violet\r\naniline dyes are all very evanescent, rapidly fading and eventually\r\ndisappearing; light blue and rhodamin, while sensitive to light, are\r\nfar less so than the greens and violets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALPHABETICAL LIST OF COLORS REPRESENTED ON PLATES OF THIS WORK\r\n\r\n\r\n   COLOR NAME.

Larger disks\r\nof spectrum red, green, and violet are interlocked and adjusted so\r\nthat they present, respectively, 32, 42, and 26 per cent. of the\r\ncircumference; superimposed on these is a single smaller disk of\r\nneutral gray, and on this two still smaller disks of black and white,\r\nthe former occupying 79, the latter 21, per cent. of the area. The\r\nresult of this combination of colors, when the disks are rapidly\r\nrevolved, is that the entire surface becomes a uniform neutral gray\r\nprecisely like the middle disk, which blends so completely with the\r\ncolor inside and outside its limits that no trace of division can be\r\ndetected. Hence, neutral gray equals a combination of red 32, green\r\n42, and violet 26 per cent., and also equals a combination of black\r\n79 and white 21 per cent. As further illustrating the point, it may\r\nbe mentioned that not only does the above-mentioned combination\r\nof the three primary colors equal neutral gray but so also does\r\nthe combination of any color (\"secondary\" or \"tertiary\" as well as\r\nprimary) with its complementary, though the darkness or lightness\r\nof the gray varies somewhat, as the following table shows:\r\n\r\n  Spectrum Color.

The following table, showing the average, mean,\r\nand extreme wave-length of each of the spectrum colors as given by\r\nnine or more authorities together with those of the present work (as\r\ndetermined by Dr. P. G. Nutting, Associate Physicist of the U. S.\r\nBureau of Standards) is of interest in this connection:\r\n\r\n                           Average        Extremes          Mean\r\n            This work.     of 9-12         of 9-12         of 9-12\r\n                         authorities.    authorities.    authorities.\r\n\r\n  Red        644            6770          6440-7028        6734 (10)\r\n  Orange     598 ± 2        6074          5892-6300        6096 (9)\r\n  Yellow     577 ± 1        5786          5640-5850        5745 (10)\r\n  Green      520 ± 10       5235          5050-5335        5193 (11)\r\n  Blue       473 ± 3        4738          4520-4861        4680 (12)\r\n  Violet     410            4176          4050-4330        4190 (10)\r\n\r\nFrom this table it will be seen that the red of this work is\r\nappreciably more orange than that of others, the orange slightly more\r\nyellowish, and the violet a little less bluish than the average;\r\nbut the author is assured by Dr. Nutting that these standards are\r\nexceptionally accurate.\r\n\r\n[13] The percentages are given in tables on pages 23 and 25.\r\n\r\n[14] That is to say, theoretically. Unfortunately it seems to be beyond\r\nthe colorists' skill to reproduce true shades of the pure colors, all\r\nshowing a more or less decided admixture of gray, resulting in a series\r\nof broken or dull shades. (See pages 23 and 24.)\r\n\r\n[15] Although only 1115 different colors are actually shown on\r\nthe plates the system is really equivalent to the presentation of\r\nconsiderably more than 4000 distinguishable and designatable colors.\r\n\r\n[16] The Theory of Color (American edition, 1876), p. 99.\r\n\r\n[17] In the present work the possibility of variation between\r\ndifferent copies is wholly eliminated by a very different process of\r\nreproduction. Each color, for the entire edition, is painted uniformly\r\non large sheets of paper from a single mixture of pigments, these\r\nsheets being then cut into the small squares which represent the colors\r\non the plates.\r\n\r\n[18] See Rood: Modern Chromatics, pages 50-52.\r\n\r\n[19] Some criticisms of Popular Color Definitions and Suggestions for\r\na better Color Nomenclature. Milton Bradley Co., Springfield, Mass.\r\n(Small pamphlet of 15 pages).\r\n\r\n[20] Milton Bradley: Elementary Color, p. 25.\r\n\r\n[21] Exception has been taken in a recent work (\"A Color Notation,\"\r\nby A. H. Munsell) to the use of the term tone in this connection, on\r\nthe ground that its proper use belongs to music, and the term _value_\r\nis substituted. The same line of reasoning would, however, certainly\r\nrequire the discarding of _chromatic scale_ as a term of music\r\nnomenclature, since its derivation is clearly from color (chroma).\r\nFurthermore, the word \"value\" is even more elastic in its application\r\nthan tone, and, all things considered, the present writer, at least,\r\nfails to see that any improvement is made by the proposed change.\r\n\r\n[22] The term _chromatic scale_ has unfortunately been appropriated for\r\na very different use (in music); nevertheless it is strictly correct\r\nin the present sense while in the other it is not, though firmly\r\nestablished by long usage. The term _spectrum scale_ is not adequate,\r\nas a substitute, because the spectrum series of colors is incomplete\r\nthrough absence of the hues connecting violet with red, which are\r\nnecessary to show the full scale of pure colors and hues.\r\n\r\n[23] The distinctions of color or hue diminishing in proportion to the\r\nincreased admixture of gray, each alternate color or hue, with its\r\nscale (vertical) of tones, is omitted from the third and fourth series;\r\nwhile in the fifth the color differentiation is so greatly reduced that\r\nonly the six spectrum colors (dulled by admixture of 95.5 per cent. of\r\nneutral gray), together with purple (the intermediate between violet\r\nand red) are given; a yellow orange hue being substituted for spectrum\r\norange because it is more exactly intermediate in hue between red and\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\n[24] J. J. Müller found that a mixture of the orange and violet rays\r\nof the spectrum produced a whitish red (Rood, \"Modern Chromatics,\" p.\r\n129). The author of the present work, without being at the time aware\r\nof this, produced an absolutely pure red (but of reduced intensity)\r\nby mixture of either orange and violet (orange 63.5, violet 36.5 per\r\ncent. = red 85 + white 15 per cent.), or from orange and the violet-red\r\nwhich is complementary to green (violet-red 51, orange 49 per cent.),\r\nthe latter equaling red 89 + white 11 per cent; the mixtures being made\r\non a color-wheel with Maxwell disks representing the pure colors of the\r\npresent work. The red resulting from either of these mixtures on the\r\ncolor-wheel is far purer than the blue resulting from mixture of green\r\nand violet, and incomparably more so than the yellow resulting from\r\nmixture of either red and green or orange and green. Consequently, if\r\nthe same results would come from mixing orange and violet light, it is\r\ndifficult to understand how red can be a primary color _according to\r\nthe accepted definition_.\r\n\r\n[25] Rood: Modern Chromatics, p. 34.\r\n\r\nWith the single exception of Vanderpoel (Color Problems, p. 28,\r\nplates 3, 4, where yellow is given first in order of luminosity) all\r\nauthorities on color-physics that I have been able to consult very\r\nsingularly ignore yellow entirely in their treatment of the subject of\r\nluminosity.\r\n\r\n[26] All quotations here are from Milton Bradley's \"Elementary Color,\"\r\nexcept where otherwise noted.\r\n\r\n[27] As determined by Dr. P.

The latter include carmine and other\r\ncochineal lakes, colors of vegetable origin (as gamboge, violet\r\ncarmine, indigo, etc.), and most of the aniline or coal tar dyes,\r\nthough among the last are a considerable number which are really more\r\npermanent than several colors habitually used by artists. Certain\r\ncolors in this work could not, however, possibly be reproduced except\r\nby the employment of pigments which are more or less sensitive to\r\n_prolonged exposure_ to light, and hence this caution not to expose the\r\nplates unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n(See _Church_: \"The Chemistry of Paints and Painting,\" third edition,\r\npages 257-263.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plate I_\r\n\r\n\r\n     1 RED

They were made at an early stage in\r\nthe preparation of the work and discarded; but were finally inserted,\r\nmerely to add to the number of colors represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note\r\n\r\nUnderscores are used to mark _italic text_.\r\n\r\nEqual signs are used to mark =bold text=.\r\n\r\nCapital letters are used to represent SMALL CAPS.\r\n\r\nThe color sample for Light Corinthian Red on plate VVXII is missing\r\nfrom the original book.",
