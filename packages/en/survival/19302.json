There has\r\nbeen a considerable demand for these articles which are now mostly out\r\nof print. In reprinting it seemed best to combine and supplement them\r\nso as to make a consecutive and intelligible account of the Dinosaur\r\ncollections in the Museum. The original notices are quoted verbatim;\r\nfor the remainder of the text the present writer is responsible.\r\nProfessor S.W. Williston of Chicago University has kindly contributed\r\na chapter--all too brief--describing the first discoveries of\r\ndinosaurs in the Western formations that have since yielded so large a\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\nThe photographs of American Museum specimens are by Mr. A.E. Anderson;\r\nthe field photographs by various Museum expeditions; the restorations\r\nby Mr. Charles R. Knight. Most of these illustrations have been\r\npublished elsewhere by Professor Osborn, Mr. Brown and others. The\r\ndiagrams, figs. 1-9, 24, 25, 37 and 40, are my own.\r\n\r\n                         W.

Its time is measured in\r\ngeologic epochs and periods, in millions of years instead of\r\ncenturies. Man, by this measure, is but a creature of yesterday--his\r\n\"forty centuries of civilization\"[1] but a passing episode. It is by\r\nno means easy for us to adjust our perspective to the immensely long\r\nspaces of time involved in geological evolution. We are apt to think\r\nof all these extinct animals merely as prehistoric--to imagine them\r\nall living at the same time and contending with our cave-dwelling\r\nancestors for the mastery of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the place of the Dinosaurs in world-history, we\r\nmust first get some idea of the length of geologic periods and the\r\nimmense space of time separating one extinct fauna from another.\r\n\r\n_The Age of Man._ Prehistoric time, as it is commonly understood, is\r\nthe time when barbaric and savage tribes of men inhabited the world\r\nbut before civilization began, and earlier than the written records on\r\nwhich history is based. This corresponds roughly to the Pleistocene\r\nepoch of geology; it is included along with the much shorter time\r\nduring which civilization has existed, in the latest and shortest of\r\nthe geological periods, the Quaternary. It was the age of the mammoth\r\nand the mastodon, the megatherium and Irish deer and of other\r\nquadrupeds large and small which are now extinct; but most of its\r\nanimals were the same species as now exist. It was marked by the great\r\nepisode of the Ice Age, when considerable parts of the earth's surface\r\nwere buried under immense accumulations of ice, remnants of which are\r\nstill with us in the icy covering of Greenland and Antarctica.\r\n\r\n_The Age of Mammals._ Before this period was a very much longer\r\none--at least thirty times as long--during which modern quadrupeds\r\nwere slowly evolving from small and primitive ancestors into their\r\npresent variety of form and size. This is the Tertiary Period or Age\r\nof Mammals. Through this long period we can trace step by step the\r\nsuccessive stages through which the ancestors of horses, camels,\r\nelephants, rhinoceroses, etc., were gradually converted into their\r\npresent form in adaptation to their various habits and environment.\r\nAnd with them were slowly evolved various kinds of quadrupeds whose\r\ndescendants do not now exist, the Titanotheres, Elotheres, Oreodonts,\r\netc., extinct races which have not survived to our time. Man, as such,\r\nhad not yet come into existence, nor are we able to trace any direct\r\nand complete line of ancestry among the fossil species known to us;\r\nbut his collateral ancestors were represented by the fossil species\r\nof monkeys and lemurs of the Tertiary period.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 1.--The Later Ages of Geologic Time.]\r\n\r\n_The Age of Reptiles._ Preceding the Age of Mammals lies a long vista\r\nof geologic periods of which the later ones are marked by the\r\ndominance of Reptiles, and are grouped together as the Age of Reptiles\r\nor Mesozoic Era. This was the reign of the Dinosaurs, and in it we are\r\nintroduced to a world of life so different from that of today that we\r\nmight well imagine ourselves upon another planet.\r\n\r\nNone of the ordinary quadrupeds with which we are familiar then\r\nexisted, nor any related to nor resembling them. But in their place\r\nwere reptiles large and small, carnivorous and herbivorous, walking,\r\nswimming and even flying.\r\n\r\n_Crocodiles, Turtles and Sea Reptiles._ The Crocodiles and Turtles of\r\nthe swamps were not so very different from their modern descendants;\r\nthere were also sea-crocodiles, sea-turtles, huge marine lizards\r\n(Mosasaurs) with flippers instead of feet; and another group of great\r\nmarine reptiles (Plesiosaurs) somewhat like sea-turtles but with long\r\nneck and toothed jaws and without any carapace. These various kinds of\r\nsea-reptiles took the place of the great sea mammals of modern times\r\n(which were evolved during the Age of Mammals); of whales and\r\ndolphins, seals and walruses, and manatees.\r\n\r\n_Pterodactyls._ The flying Reptiles or Pterosaurians, partly took the\r\nplace of birds, and most of them were of small size. Strange\r\nbat-winged creatures, the wing membrane stretched on the enormously\r\nelongated fourth finger, they are of all extinct reptiles the least\r\nunderstood, the most difficult to reconstruct and visualize as they\r\nwere in life.\r\n\r\n_Dinosaurs._ The land reptiles were chiefly Dinosaurs, a group which\r\nflourished throughout the Age of Reptiles and became extinct at its\r\nclose. \"Dinosaur\" is a general term which covers as wide a variety in\r\nsize and appearance as \"Quadruped\" among modern animals. And the\r\nDinosaurs in the Age of Reptiles occupied about the same place in\r\nnature as the larger quadrupeds do today. They have been called the\r\nGiant Reptiles, for those we know most about were gigantic in size,\r\nbut there were also numerous smaller kinds, the smallest no larger\r\nthan a cat. All of them had short, compact bodies, long tails, and\r\nlong legs for a reptile, and instead of crawling, they walked or ran,\r\nsometimes upon all fours, more generally upon the hind limbs, like\r\nostriches, the long tail balancing the weight of the body. Some modern\r\nlizards run this way on occasion, especially if they are in a hurry.\r\nBut the bodies of lizards are too long and their limbs too small and\r\nslender for this to be the usual mode of progress, as it seems to have\r\nbeen among the Dinosaurs.\r\n\r\n  ANIMALS OF THE AGE OF REPTILES.\r\n    LAND REPTILES.\r\n      DINOSAURS corresponding to the larger quadrupeds or land\r\n        mammals of today.\r\n      CROCODILES, LIZARDS AND TURTLES still surviving.\r\n    SEA REPTILES.\r\n      PLESIOSAURS  } corresponding to whales, dolphins, seals,\r\n      ICHTHYOSAURS } etc., or sea-mammals of today.\r\n      MOSASAURS    }\r\n    FLYING REPTILES OR PTEROSAURS.\r\n    BIRDS WITH TEETH (scarce and little known).\r\n    PRIMITIVE MAMMALS of minute size (scarce and little known).\r\n    FISHES and INVERTEBRATES many of them of extinct races, all\r\n      more or less different from modern kinds.\r\n\r\nFishes, large and small, were common in the seas and rivers of the Age\r\nof Reptiles but all of them were more or less different from modern\r\nkinds, and many belonged to ancient races now rare or extinct.\r\n\r\nThe lower animals or Invertebrates were also different from those of\r\ntoday, although some would not be very noticeably so at first glance.\r\nAmong molluscs, the Ammonites, related to the modern Pearly Nautilus,\r\nare an example of a race very numerous and varied during all the\r\nperiods of the Reptilian Era, but disappearing at its close, leaving\r\nonly a few collateral descendants in the squids, cuttlefish and nautili\r\nof the modern seas. The Brachiopods were another group of molluscs, or\r\nrather molluscoids for they were not true molluscs, less abundant even\r\nthen than in previous ages and now surviving only in a few rare and\r\nlittle known types such as the lamp-shell (_Terebratulina_).\r\n\r\n_Insects._ The Insect life of the earlier part of the Age of Reptiles\r\nwas notable for the absence of all the higher groups and orders,\r\nespecially those adapted to feed on flowers. There were no butterflies\r\nor moths, no bees or wasps or ants although there were plenty of\r\ndragonflies, cockroaches, bugs and beetles. But in the latter part of\r\nthis era, all these higher orders appeared along with the flowering\r\nplants and trees.\r\n\r\n_Plants._ The vegetation in the early part of the era was very\r\ndifferent both from the gloomy forests of the more ancient Coal Era\r\nand from that which prevails today. Cycads, ferns and fern-like\r\nplants, coniferous trees, especially related to the modern\r\n_Araucaria_ or Norfolk Island Pine, Ginkgos still surviving in China,\r\nand huge equisetae or horsetail rushes, still surviving in South\r\nAmerican swamps and with dwarfed relatives throughout the world, were\r\nthe dominant plant types of that era. The flowering plants and\r\ndeciduous trees had not appeared. But in the latter half of the era\r\nthese appeared in ever increasing multitudes, displacing the lower\r\ntypes and relegating them to a subordinate position. Unlike the more\r\nrapidly changing higher animals these ancient Mesozoic groups of\r\nplants have not wholly disappeared, but still survive, mostly in\r\ntropical and southern regions or as a scanty remnant in contrast with\r\ntheir once varied and dominant role.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that upon the appearance of these\r\nhigher plants whose flower and fruit afforded a more concentrated and\r\nnourishing food, depended largely the evolution of the higher animal\r\nlife both vertebrate and insect, of the Cenozoic or modern era.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The records of Egypt and Chaldaea extend back at least\r\nsixty centuries.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nNORTH AMERICA IN THE AGE OF REPTILES.\r\n\r\nITS GEOGRAPHIC AND CLIMATIC CHANGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth America in the Age of Reptiles would have seemed almost as\r\nstrange to our eyes in its geography as in its animals and plants. The\r\npresent outlines of its coast, its mountains and valleys, its rivers\r\nand lakes, have mostly arisen since that time. Even the more ancient\r\nparts of the continent have been profoundly modified through the\r\nincessant work of rain and rivers and of the waves, tending to wear\r\ndown the land surfaces, of volcanic outbursts building them up, and of\r\nthe more mysterious agencies which raise or depress vast stretches of\r\nmountain chains or even the whole area of a continent, and which tend\r\non the whole so far as we can see, to restore or increase the relief\r\nof the continents, as the action of the surface waters tends to bring\r\nthem down to or beneath the sea level.\r\n\r\n_Alternate Overflow and Emergence of Continents._ In a broad way these\r\nagencies of elevation and of erosion have caused in their age-long\r\nstruggle an alternation of periods of overflow and periods of\r\ncontinental emergence during geologic time. During the periods of\r\noverflow, great portions of the low-lying parts of the continents were\r\nsubmerged, and formed extensive but comparatively shallow seas. The\r\nmountains through long continued erosion were reduced to gentle and\r\nuniform slopes of comparatively slight elevation. Their materials were\r\nbrought down by rivers to the sea-coast, and distributed as\r\nsedimentary formations over the shallow interior seas or along the\r\nmargins of the continents. But this load of sediments, transferred\r\nfrom the dry land to the ocean margins and shallow seas, disturbed the\r\nbalance of weight (isostasy) which normally keeps the continental\r\nplatforms above the level of the ocean basins (which as shown by\r\ngravity measurement are underlain by materials of higher specific\r\ngravity than the continents). In due course of time, when the strain\r\nbecame sufficient, it was readjusted by earth movements of a slowness\r\nproportioned to their vastness. These movements while tending upon the\r\nwhole to raise the continents to or sometimes beyond their former\r\nrelief, did not reverse the action of erosion agencies in detail, but\r\noften produced new lines or areas of high elevation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 2.--North America in the Later Cretacic\r\n  Period. Map outlines after Schuchert.]\r\n\r\n_Geologic Periods._ A geologic period is the record of one of these\r\nimmense and long continued movements of alternate submergence and\r\nelevation of the continents. It begins, therefore, and ends with a\r\ntime of emergence, and includes a long era of submergence.\r\n\r\nThese epochs of elevation are accompanied by the development of cold\r\nclimates at the poles, and elsewhere of arid conditions in the\r\ninterior of the continents. The epochs of submergence are accompanied\r\nby a warm, humid climate, more or less uniform from the equator to the\r\npoles.\r\n\r\nThe earth has very recently, in a geologic sense, passed through an\r\nepoch of extreme continental elevation the maximum of which was marked\r\nby the \"Ice Age.\" The continents are still emerged for the most part\r\nalmost to the borders of the \"continental shelf\" which forms their\r\nmaximum limit. And in the icy covering of Greenland and Antarctica a\r\nconsiderable portion still remains of the great ice-sheets which at\r\ntheir maximum covered large parts of North America and Europe. We are\r\nnow at the beginning of a long period of slow erosion and subsidence\r\nwhich, if this interpretation of the geologic record be correct, will\r\nin the course of time reduce the mountains to plains and submerge\r\ngreat parts of the lowlands beneath the ocean. As compensation for the\r\nlesser extent of dry land we may look forward to a more genial and\r\nfavorable climate in the reduced areas that remain above water.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 3.--Relative Length of Ages of Reptiles,\r\n  Mammals and Man.]\r\n\r\n_Length of Geologic Cycles._ But these vast cycles of geographic and\r\nclimatic change will take millions of years to accomplish their\r\ncourse. The brief span of human life, or even the few centuries of\r\nrecorded civilization are far too short to show any perceptible change\r\nin climate due to this cause. The utmost stretch of a man's life will\r\ncover perhaps one-two hundred thousandth part of a geologic period.\r\nThe time elapsed since the dawn of civilization is less than a\r\nthree-thousandth part. Of the days and hours of this geologic year,\r\nour historic records cover but two or three minutes, our individual\r\nlives but a fraction of a second. We must not expect to find records\r\nof its changing seasons in human history, still less to observe them\r\npersonally.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 4.--Relative Length of Prehistoric and\r\n  Historic Time.]\r\n\r\nThere are indeed minor cycles of climate within this great cycle. The\r\ngreat Ice Age through which the earth has so recently passed was\r\nmarked by alternations of severity and mildness of climate, of advance\r\nand recession of the glaciers, and within these smaller cycles are\r\nminor alternations whose effect upon the course of human history has\r\nbeen shown recently by Professor Huntington (\"The Pulse of Asia\"). But\r\nthe great cycles of the geologic periods are of a scope far too vast\r\nfor their changes to be perceptible to us except through their\r\ninfluence upon the course of evolution.\r\n\r\n_The Later Cycles of Geologic Time._ The Reptilian Era opens with a\r\nperiod of extreme elevation, which rivalled that of the Glacial Epoch\r\nand was similarly accompanied by extensive glaciation of which some\r\ntraces are preserved to our day in characteristic glacial boulders,\r\nice scratches, and till, imbedded or inter-stratified in the strata of\r\nthe Permian age. Between these two extremes of continental emergence,\r\nthe Permian and the Pleistocene, we can trace six cycles of alternate\r\nsubmergence and elevation, as shown in the diagram (Fig. 5),\r\nrepresenting the proportion of North America which is known to have\r\nbeen above water during the six geologic periods that intervene.\r\n\r\nFrom this diagram it will appear that the six cycles or periods were\r\nby no means equal in the amount of overflow or complete recovery of\r\nthe drowned lands. The Cretacic period was marked by a much more\r\nextensive and long continued flooding; the great plains west of the\r\nMississippi were mostly under water from the Gulf of Mexico to the\r\nArctic Ocean. The earlier overflows were neither so extensive nor so\r\nlong continued. The great uplift of the close of the Cretacic regained\r\npermanently the great central region and united East and West, and the\r\noverflows of the Age of Mammals were mostly limited to the South\r\nAtlantic and Gulf coasts.\r\n\r\n_Sedimentary Formations._ During the epochs of greatest overflow great\r\nmarine formations were deposited over large areas of what is now dry\r\nland. These were followed as the land rose to sea level by extensive\r\nmarsh and delta formations, and these in turn by scattered and\r\nfragmentary dry land deposits spread by rivers over their flood\r\nplains. In the marine formations are found the fossil remains of the\r\nsea-animals of the period; in the coast and delta formations are the\r\nremains of those which inhabited the marshes and forests of the coast\r\nregions; while the animals of the dryland, of plains and upland, left\r\ntheir remains in the river-plain formations.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 5.--Geologic Cycles and the Land Area of North\r\n  America (after Schuchert).]\r\n\r\nThese last, however, fragmentary and loose and overlying the rest,\r\nwere the first to be swept away by erosion during the periods of\r\nelevation; and of such formations in the Age of Reptiles very little,\r\nif anything, seems to have been preserved to our day. Consequently we\r\nknow very little about the upland animals of those times, if as seems\r\nvery probable, they were more or less different from the animals of\r\nthe coast-forests and swamps. The river-plain deposits of the Age of\r\nMammals on the other hand, are still quite extensive, especially those\r\nof its later epochs, and afford a fairly complete record in some parts\r\nof the continent of the upland fauna of those regions.\r\n\r\n_Occurrence of Dinosaur Bones._ Dinosaur bones are found mostly in the\r\ngreat delta formations, and since those were accumulated chiefly in\r\nthe early stages of great continental elevations, it follows that our\r\nacquaintance with Dinosaurs is mostly limited to those living at\r\ncertain epochs during the Age of Reptiles. In point of fact so far as\r\nexplorations have yet gone in this country, the Dinosaur fauna of the\r\nclose of the Jurassic and beginning of the Comanchic and that of the\r\nlater Cretacic are the only ones we know much about. The immense\r\ninterval of time that preceded, and the no less vast stretch of time\r\nthat separated them, is represented in the record of Dinosaur history\r\nby a multitude of tracks and a few imperfect skeletons assigned to the\r\nclose of the Triassic period, and by a few fragments from formations\r\nwhich may be intermediate in age between the Jurassic-Comanchic and\r\nthe late Cretacic. Consequently we cannot expect to trace among the\r\nDinosaurs, the gradual evolution of different races, as we can do\r\namong the quadrupeds of the Age of Mammals.\r\n\r\n_Imperfection of the Geologic Record._ The Age of Mammals in North\r\nAmerica presents a moving picture of the successive stages in the\r\nevolution of modern quadrupeds; the Age of Reptiles shows (broadly\r\nconsidered) two photographs representing the land vertebrates of two\r\nlong distant periods, as remote in time from each other as the later\r\none is remote from the present day. Of the earlier stages in the\r\nevolution of the Dinosaurs there are but a few imperfect sketches in\r\nthis country; in Europe the picture is more complete. In the course of\r\ntime, as exploration progresses, we shall no doubt recover more\r\ncomplete records. But probably we shall never have so complete a\r\nhistory of the terrestrial life of the Age of Reptiles as we have of\r\nthe Age of Mammals. The records are defective, a large part of them\r\ndestroyed or forever inaccessible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nKINDS OF DINOSAURS.\r\n\r\nCOMMON CHARACTERS AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS GROUPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter we have attempted to point out the place in\r\nnature that the Dinosaurs occupied and the conditions under which they\r\nlived. They were the dominant land animals of their time, just as the\r\nquadrupeds were during the Age of Mammals. Their sway endured for a\r\nlong era, estimated at nine millions of years, and about three times\r\nas long as the period which has elapsed since their disappearance.\r\nThey survived vast changes in geography and climate, and became\r\nextinct through a combination of causes not fully understood as yet;\r\nprobably the great changes in physical conditions at the end of the\r\nCretacic period, and the development of mammals and birds, more\r\nintelligent, more active, and better adapted to the new conditions of\r\nlife, were the most important factors in their extinction.\r\n\r\nThe Dinosaurs originated, so far as we can judge, as lizard-like\r\nreptiles with comparatively long limbs, long tails, five toes on each\r\nfoot, tipped with sharp claws, and with a complete series of sharp\r\npointed teeth. It would seem probable that these ancestors were more\r\nor less bipedal, and adapted to live on dry land. They were probably\r\nmuch like the modern lizards in size, appearance and habitat:[2]\r\n\r\nFrom this ancestral type the Dinosaurs evolved into a great variety of\r\ndifferent kinds, many of them of gigantic size, some herbivorous, some\r\ncarnivorous; some bipedal, others quadrupedal; many of them protected\r\nby various kinds of bony armor-plates, or provided with horns or\r\nspines; some with sharp claws, others with blunted claws or hoofs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 6.--Outline Restorations of Dinosaurs. Scale\r\n  about nineteen feet to the inch.]\r\n\r\nThese various kinds of Dinosaurs are customarily grouped as follows:\r\n\r\nI. _Carnivorous Dinosaurs_ or _Theropoda_. With sharp pointed teeth,\r\nsharp claws; bipedal, with bird-like hind feet, generally\r\nthree-toed;[3] the fore-limbs adapted for grasping or tearing, but not\r\nfor support of the body. The head is large, neck of moderate length,\r\nbody unarmored. The principal Dinosaurs of this group in America are\r\n\r\n_Allosaurus_, _Ornitholestes_--Upper Jurassic period.\r\n\r\n_Tyrannosaurus, Deinodon, Albertosaurus, Ornithomimus_--Upper Cretacic\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 7.--Skulls of Dinosaurs, illustrating the\r\n  principal types--_Anchisaurus_ after Marsh, the others from\r\n  American Museum specimens.]\r\n\r\nII. _Amphibious Dinosaurs_ or _Sauropoda_. With blunt-pointed teeth\r\nand blunt claws, quadrupedal, with elephant-like limbs and feet, long\r\nneck and small head. Unarmored. Principal dinosaurs of this group in\r\nAmerica are _Brontosaurus_, _Diplodocus_, _Camarasaurus_\r\n(_Morosaurus_) and _Brachiosaurus_, all of the Upper Jurassic and\r\nComanchic periods.\r\n\r\nIII. _Beaked Dinosaurs_ or _Predentates_. With a horny beak on the\r\nfront of the jaw, cutting or grinding teeth behind it. All\r\nherbivorous, with pelvis of peculiar type, with hoofs instead of\r\nclaws, and many genera heavily armored. Mostly three short toes on the\r\nhind foot, four or five on the fore foot. This group comprises animals\r\nof very different proportions as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Iguanodonts._ Bipedal, unarmored, with a single row of serrated\r\ncutting teeth, three-toed hind feet. Upper Jurassic, Comanchic and\r\nCretacic. _Camptosaurus_ is the best known American genus.\r\n\r\n2. _Trachodonts_ or _Duck-billed Dinosaurs_. Like the Iguanodonts but\r\nwith numerous rows of small teeth set close together to form a\r\ngrinding surface. Cretacic period. _Trachodon, Hadrosaurus,\r\nClaosaurus, Saurolophus, Corythosaurus, etc._\r\n\r\n3. _Stegosaurs_ or _Armored Dinosaurs_. Quadrupedal dinosaurs with\r\nelephantine feet, short neck, small head, body and tail armored with\r\nmassive bony plates and often with large bony spines. Teeth in a\r\nsingle row, like those of Iguanodonts. _Stegosaurus_ of the Upper\r\nJurassic, _Ankylosaurus_ of the Upper Cretacic.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 8.--Hind Feet of Dinosaurs, to show the three\r\n  chief types (Theropoda, Orthopoda, Sauropoda).]\r\n\r\n4. _Ceratopsian_ or _Horned Dinosaurs_. Quadrupedal with elephantine\r\nfeet, short neck, very large head enlarged by an enormous bony frill\r\ncovering the neck, with a pair of horns over the eyes and a single\r\nhorn in front. Teeth in a single row, but broadened out and adapted\r\nfor grinding the food. No body armor. _Triceratops_ is the best known\r\ntype. _Monoclonius_, _Ceratops_, _Torosaurus_ and _Anchiceratops_ are\r\nalso of this group. All from the Cretacic period.\r\n\r\n_Classification of Dinosaurs._ It is probable that the Dinosaurs are\r\nnot really a natural group or order of reptiles, although they have\r\nbeen generally so considered. The Carnivorous and Amphibious Dinosaurs\r\nin spite of their diverse appearance and habits, are rather nearly\r\nrelated, while the Beaked Dinosaurs form a group apart, and may be\r\ndescendants of a different group of primitive reptiles. These\r\nrelations are most clearly seen in the construction of the pelvis (see\r\nfig. 9). In the first two groups the pubis projects downward and\r\nforward as it does in the majority of reptiles, and the ilium is a\r\nhigh rounded plate; while in the others the pelvis is of a wholly\r\ndifferent type, strongly suggesting the pelvis of birds.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 9.--Pelves of Dinosaurs illustrating the two\r\n  chief types (Saurischia, Ornithischia) and their variations.]\r\n\r\nRecent researches upon Triassic dinosaurs, especially by the\r\ndistinguished German savants, Friedrich von Huene, Otto Jaekel and the\r\nlate Eberhard Fraas, and the discovery of more complete specimens of\r\nthese animals, also clear up the true relationships of these\r\nprimitive dinosaurs which have mostly been referred hitherto to the\r\nTheropoda or Megalosaurians.

The well-finished joints,\r\ndense texture of the hollow bones and strongly marked muscle-scars\r\nindicate that they were active and powerful beasts of prey. They range\r\nfrom small slender animals up to the gigantic _Tyrannosaurus_\r\nequalling the modern elephant in bulk. They were half lizard, half\r\nbird in proportions, combining the head, the short neck and small fore\r\nlimbs and long snaky tail of the lizard with the short, compact body,\r\nlong powerful hind limbs and three-toed feet of the bird. The skin was\r\nprobably either naked or covered with horny scales as in lizards and\r\nsnakes; at all events it was not armor-plated as in the crocodile.[4]\r\nThey walked or ran upon the hind legs; in many of them the fore limbs\r\nare quite unfitted for support of the body and must have been used\r\nsolely in fighting or tearing their prey.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 10.--Hind Limb of Allosaurus, Dr. J.L. Wortman\r\n  standing to one side. Dr. Wortman is one of the most notable and\r\n  successful collectors of fossil vertebrates and was in charge of\r\n  the Museum's field work in this department from 1891-1898.]\r\n\r\nThe huge size of some of these Mesozoic beasts of prey finds no\r\nparallel among their modern analogues. It is only among marine animals\r\nthat we find predaceous types of such gigantic size. But among the\r\ncarnivorous dinosaurs we fail to find any indications of aquatic or\r\neven amphibious habits. They might indeed wade in the water, but they\r\ncould hardly be at home in it, for they were clearly not good\r\nswimmers. We must suppose that they were dry land animals or at most\r\nswamp dwellers.\r\n\r\n_Dinosaur Footprints._ The ancestors of the Theropoda appear first in\r\nthe Triassic period, already of large size, but less completely\r\nbipedal than their successors. Incomplete skeletons have been found in\r\nthe Triassic formations of Germany[5] but in this country they are\r\nchiefly known from the famous fossil footprints (or \"bird-tracks\" as\r\nthey were at first thought to be), found in the flagstone quarries at\r\nTurner's Falls on the Connecticut River, in the vicinity of Boonton,\r\nNew Jersey, and elsewhere. These tracks are the footprints of numerous\r\nkinds of dinosaurs, large and small, mostly of the carnivorous group,\r\nwhich lived in that region in the earlier part of the Age of Reptiles,\r\nand much has been learned from them as to the habits of the animals\r\nthat made them. The tracks ascribed to carnivorous dinosaurs run in\r\nseries with narrow tread, short or long steps, here and there a light\r\nimpression of tail or forefoot and occasionally the mark of the shank\r\nand pelvis when the animal settled back and squatted down to rest a\r\nmoment. The modern crocodiles when they lift the body off the ground,\r\nwaddle forward with the short limbs wide apart, and even the lizards\r\nwhich run on their hind legs have a rather wide tread. But these\r\ndinosaurs ran like birds, setting one foot nearly in front of the\r\nother, so that the prints of right and left feet are nearly in a\r\nstraight line. This was on account of their greater length of limb,\r\nwhich made it easy for them to swing the foot directly underneath the\r\nbody at each step like mammals and birds, and thus maintain an even\r\nbalance, instead of wabbling from side to side as short legged animals\r\nare compelled to do.\r\n\r\nOf the animals that made these innumerable tracks the actual remains\r\nfound thus far in this country are exceedingly scanty. Two or three\r\nincomplete skeletons of small kinds are in the Yale Museum, of which\r\n_Anchisaurus_ is the best known.\r\n\r\n_Megalosaurus._ Fragmentary remains of this huge carnivorous dinosaur\r\nwere found in England nearly a century ago, and the descriptions by\r\nDean Buckland and Sir Richard Owen and the restorations due to the\r\nimaginative chisel of Waterhouse Hawkins, have made it familiar to\r\nmost English readers. Unfortunately it was, and still remains, very\r\nimperfectly known. It was very closely related to the American\r\n_Allosaurus_ and unquestionably similar in appearance and habits.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nALLOSAURUS.\r\n\r\nThe following extract is from the American Museum Journal for January\r\n1908.[7]\r\n\r\n\"Although smaller than its huge contemporary Brontosaurus, this animal\r\nis of gigantic proportions being 34 feet 2 inches in length, and 8\r\nfeet 3 inches high.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 11.--MOUNTED SKELETON OF ALLOSAURUS IN THE\r\n  AMERICAN MUSEUM. _After Osborn_]\r\n\r\n_History of the Allosaurus Skeleton._ \"This rare and finely preserved\r\nskeleton was collected by Mr. F.F. Hubbell in October 1879, in the\r\nComo Bluffs near Medicine Bow, Wyoming, the richest locality in\r\nAmerica for dinosaur skeletons, and is a part of the great collection\r\nof fossil reptiles, amphibians and fishes gathered together by the\r\nlate Professor E.D. Cope, and presented to the American Museum in 1899\r\nby President Jesup.\r\n\r\n\"Shortly after the Centennial Exposition (1876) it had been planned\r\nthat Professor Cope's collection of fossils should form part of a\r\ngreat public museum in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, the city\r\nundertaking the cost of preparing and exhibiting the specimens, an\r\narrangement similar to that existing between the American Museum and\r\nthe City of New York.[8]\r\n\r\n\"The plan, however, fell through, and the greater part of this\r\nmagnificent collection remained in storage in the basement of Memorial\r\nHall in Fairmount Park, for the next twenty years. From time to time\r\nProfessor Cope removed parts of the collection to his private museum\r\nin Pine Street, for purposes of study and scientific description. He\r\nseems, however, to have had no idea of the perfection and value of\r\nthis specimen. In 1899 when the collection was purchased from his\r\nexecutors by Mr. Jesup, the writer went to Philadelphia under the\r\ninstructions of Professor Osborn, Curator of Fossil Vertebrates, to\r\nsuperintend the packing and removal to the American Museum. At that\r\ntime the collection made by Hubbell was still in Memorial Hall, and\r\nthe boxes were piled up just as they came in from the West, never\r\nhaving been unpacked. Professor Cope's assistant, Mr. Geismar,\r\ninformed the writer that Hubbell's collection was mostly fragmentary\r\nand not of any great value. Mr. Hubbell's letters from the field\r\nunfortunately were not preserved, but it is likely that they did not\r\nmake clear what a splendid find he had made, and as some of his\r\nearlier collections had been fragmentary and of no great interest, the\r\nrest were supposed to be of the same kind.\r\n\r\n\"When the Cope Collection was unpacked at the American Museum, this\r\nlot of boxes, not thought likely to be of much interest, was left\r\nuntil the last, and not taken in hand until 1902 or 1903. But when\r\nthis specimen was laid out, it appeared that a treasure had come to\r\nlight. Although collected by the crude methods of early days, it\r\nconsisted of the greater part of the skeleton of a single individual,\r\nwith the bones in wonderfully fine preservation, considering that they\r\nhad been buried for say eight million years. They were dense black,\r\nhard and uncrushed, even better preserved and somewhat more complete\r\nthan the two fine skeletons of Allosaurus from Bone-Cabin Quarry, the\r\ngreatest treasures that this famous quarry had supplied. The great\r\ncarnivorous dinosaurs are much rarer than the herbivorous kinds, and\r\nthese three skeletons are the most complete that have ever been found.\r\nIn all the years of energetic exploration that the late Professor\r\nMarsh devoted to searching for dinosaurs in the Jurassic and\r\nCretaceous formations of the West, he did not obtain any skeletons of\r\ncarnivorous kinds anywhere near as complete as these, and their\r\nanatomy was in many respects unknown or conjectural. By comparison of\r\nthe three Allosaurus skeletons with one another and with other\r\nspecimens of carnivorous dinosaurs of smaller size in this and other\r\nmuseums, particularly in the National Museum and the Kansas University\r\nMuseum, we have been able to reconstruct the missing parts of the Cope\r\nspecimen with very little possibility of serious error.\"\r\n\r\n_Evidence for Combining and Posing this Mount._ \"An incomplete\r\nspecimen of Brontosaurus, found by Doctor Wortman and Professor W.C.\r\nKnight of the American Museum Expedition of 1897, had furnished\r\ninteresting data as to the food and habits of Allosaurus, which were\r\nconfirmed by several other fragmentary specimens obtained later in the\r\nBone-Cabin Quarry. In this Brontosaurus skeleton several of the bones,\r\nespecially the spines of the tail vertebrae, when found in the rock,\r\nlooked as if they had been scored and bitten off, as though by some\r\ncarnivorous animal which had either attacked the Brontosaurus when\r\nalive, or had feasted upon the carcass. When the Allosaurus jaw was\r\ncompared with these score marks, it was found to fit them exactly, the\r\nspacing of the scratches being the same as the spacing of the teeth.\r\nMoreover, on taking out the Brontosaurus vertebrae from the quarry, a\r\nnumber of broken off teeth of Allosaurus were found lying beside them.\r\nAs no other remains of Allosaurus or any other animal were\r\nintermingled with the Brontosaurus skeleton, the most obvious\r\nexplanation was that these teeth were broken off by an Allosaurus\r\nwhile devouring the Brontosaurus carcass. Many of the bones of other\r\nherbivorous dinosaurs found in the Bone-Cabin Quarry were similarly\r\nscored and bitten off, and the teeth of Allosaurus were also found\r\nclose to them.\r\n\r\n\"With these data at hand the original idea was conceived of combining\r\nthese two skeletons, both from the same formation and found within a\r\nfew miles of each other, to represent what must actually have happened\r\nto them in the remote Jurassic period, and mount the Allosaurus\r\nskeleton standing over the remains of a Brontosaurus in the attitude\r\nof feeding upon its carcass. Some modifications were made in the\r\nposition to suit the exigencies of an open mount, and to accommodate\r\nthe pose to the particular action; the head of the animal was lifted a\r\nlittle, one hind foot planted upon the carcass, while the other,\r\nresting upon the ground bears most of the weight. The fore feet, used\r\nin these animals only for fighting or for tearing their prey, not for\r\nsupport, are given characteristic attitudes, and the whole pose\r\nrepresents the Allosaurus devouring the carcass and raising head and\r\nfore foot in a threatening manner as though to drive away intruders.\r\nThe balance of the various parts was carefully studied and adjusted\r\nunder direction of the curator. The preparation and mounting of the\r\nspecimen were done by Mr. Adam Hermann, head preparator, and his\r\nassistants, especially Messrs. Falkenbach and Lang.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 12.--Restoration of Allosaurus by C.R. Knight.\r\n  _After Osborn_]\r\n\r\n\"As now exhibited in the Dinosaur Hall, this group gives to the\r\nimaginative observer a most vivid picture of a characteristic scene in\r\nthat bygone age, millions of years ago, when reptiles were the lords\r\nof creation, and 'Nature, red in tooth and claw' had lost none of her\r\nprimitive savagery, and the era of brute force and ferocity showed\r\nlittle sign of the gradual amelioration which was to come to pass in\r\nfuture ages through the predominance of superior intelligence.\"\r\n\r\n_Appearance and Habits of Allosaurus._ A study of the mechanism of the\r\nAllosaurus skeleton shows us in the first place that the animal is\r\nbalanced on the hind limbs, the long heavy tail making an adequate\r\ncounterpoise for the short compact body and head. The hind limbs are\r\nnine feet in length when extended, about equal to the length of the\r\nbody and neck, and the bones are massively proportioned. When the\r\nthigh bone is set in its normal position, as indicated by the position\r\nof the scars and processes for attachment of the principal muscles\r\n(see under Brontosaurus for the method used to determine this), the\r\nknee bends forward as in mammals and birds, not outward as in most\r\nmodern reptiles. The articulations of the foot bones show that the\r\nanimal rested upon the ends of the metapodials, as birds and many\r\nmammals do, not upon the sole of the foot like crocodiles or lizards.\r\nThe flat vertebral joints show that the short compact body was not as\r\nflexible as the longer body of crocodiles or lizards, in which the\r\narticulations are of the ball and socket type showing that in them\r\nthis region was very flexible. The tail also shows a limited\r\nflexibility. It could not be curled or thrown over the back, but\r\nprojected out behind the animal, swinging from side to side or up and\r\ndown as much as was needed for balance. The curvature of the ribs\r\nshows that the body was narrow and deep, unlike the broad flattened\r\nbody of the crocodile or the less flattened but still broad body of\r\nthe lizard. The loose hung jaw, articulated far back, shows by the set\r\nof its muscles that it was capable of an enormous gape; while in the\r\nskull there is evidence of a limited movement of the upper jaw on the\r\ncranial portion, intended probably to assist in the swallowing of\r\nlarge objects, like the double jointed jaw of a snake.\r\n\r\nAs to the nature of the skin we have no exact knowledge. We may be\r\nsure that it had no bony armor like the crocodile, for remains of any\r\nsuch armor could not fail to be preserved with the skeletons, as it\r\nalways is in fossil crocodiles or turtles. Perhaps it was scaly like\r\nthe skin of lizards and snakes, for the horny scales of the body are\r\nnot preserved in fossil skeletons of these reptiles. But if so we\r\nmight expect from the analogy of the lizard that the scales of the\r\nhead would be ossified and preserved in the fossil; and there is\r\nnothing of this kind in the Carnivorous Dinosaurs. We can exclude\r\nfeathers from consideration, for these dinosaurs have no affinities to\r\nbirds, and there is no evidence for feathers in any dinosaur. Probably\r\nthe best evidence is that of the Trachodon or duck-billed dinosaur\r\nalthough this animal was but distantly related to the Allosaurus. In\r\nTrachodon (see p. 94), we know that the skin bore neither feathers nor\r\noverlapping scales but had a curiously patterned mosaic of tiny\r\npolygonal plates and was thin and quite flexible. Some such type of\r\nskin as this, in default of better evidence, we may ascribe to the\r\nAllosaurus.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 13.--View in the Hell Creek badlands in\r\n  central Montana, where the Tyrannosaurus skeleton was found.]\r\n\r\nAs to its probable habits, it is safe to infer (see p. 33), that it\r\nwas predaceous, active and powerful, and adapted to terrestrial life.\r\nIts methods of attack and combat must have been more like those of\r\nmodern reptiles than the more intelligent methods of the mammalian\r\ncarnivore. The brain cast of Allosaurus indicates a brain of similar\r\ntype and somewhat inferior grade to that of the modern crocodile or\r\nlizard, and far below the bird or mammal in intelligence. The keen\r\nsense of smell of the mammal, the keen vision of the bird, the highly\r\ndeveloped reasoning power of both, were absent in the dinosaur as in\r\nthe lizard or crocodile. We may imagine the Allosaurus lying in wait,\r\nwatching his prey until its near approach stimulates him into a\r\nsemi-instinctive activity; then a sudden swift rush, a fierce snap of\r\nthe huge jaws and a savage attack with teeth and claws until the\r\nvictim is torn in pieces or swallowed whole. But the stealthy,\r\npersistent tracking of the cat or weasel tribe, the intelligent\r\ngeneralship of the wolf pack, the well planned attack at the most\r\nvulnerable point in the prey, characteristic of all the predaceous\r\nmammals, would be quite impossible to the dinosaur. By watching the\r\nhabits of modern reptiles we may gain a much better idea of his\r\ncapacities and limitations than if we judge only from the efficiency\r\nof his teeth and claws, and forget the inferior intelligence that\r\nanimated these terrible weapons.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYRANNOSAURUS.\r\n\r\nThe \"Tyrant Saurian\" as Professor Osborn has named him, was the climax\r\nof evolution of the giant flesh-eating dinosaurs. It reached a length\r\nof forty-seven feet, and in bulk must have equalled the mammoth or the\r\nmastodon or the largest living elephants. The massive hind limbs,\r\nsupporting the whole weight of the body, exceeded the limbs of the\r\ngreat proboscideans in bulk, and in a standing position the animal was\r\neighteen to twenty feet high, as against twelve for the largest\r\nAfrican elephants or the southern mammoth. The head (see frontispiece)\r\nis 4 feet 3 inches long, 3 ft. 4 inches deep, and 2 ft. 9 inches wide;\r\nthe long deep powerful jaws set with teeth from 3 to 6 inches long and\r\nan inch wide. To this powerful armament was added the great sharp\r\nclaws of the hind feet, and probably the fore feet, curved like those\r\nof eagles, but six or eight inches in length.\r\n\r\nDuring ten years explorations in the Western Cretaceous formations,\r\nMr. Brown has secured for the Museum three skeletons of this\r\nmagnificent dinosaur, incomplete, but finely preserved. The first,\r\nfound in 1900, included the jaws, a large part of backbone and ribs,\r\nand some limb bones. The second included most of skull and jaws,\r\nbackbone, ribs and pelvis and the hind limbs and feet, but not tail.\r\nThe third consisted of a perfect skull and jaws, the backbone, ribs,\r\npelvis and nearly all of the tail, but no limbs. From these three\r\nspecimens it has been possible to reconstruct the entire skeleton. The\r\nexact construction of the fore feet is the only doubtful part. The\r\nfore-limb is very small relatively to the huge size of the animal, but\r\nprobably was constructed much as in the _Allosaurus_ with two or three\r\nlarge curved claws, the inner claw opposing the others.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 14.--Quarry from which the _Tyrannosaurus_\r\n  skeleton was taken. American Museum camp in foreground.]\r\n\r\nThe missing parts of the two best skeletons have been restored, and\r\nwith the help of two small models of the skeleton, a group has been\r\nmade ready for mounting as the central piece of the proposed\r\nCretaceous Dinosaur Hall. One of the skeletons is temporarily placed\r\nin the centre of the Quaternary Hall, space for it in the present\r\nDinosaur Hall being lacking. Following is Professor Osborn's\r\ndescription of the preparation of this group:[9]\r\n\r\n\"The mounting of these two skeletons presents mechanical problems of\r\nvery great difficulty. The size and weight of the various parts are\r\nenormous. The height of the head in the standing position reaches from\r\n18 to 20 feet above the ground; the knee joint alone reaches 6 feet\r\nabove the ground. All the bones are massive; the pelvis, femur and\r\nskull are extremely heavy. Experience with _Brontosaurus_ and with\r\nother large dinosaurs proves that it is impossible to design a\r\nmetallic frame in the right pose in advance of assembling the parts.\r\nEven a scale restoration model of the animal as a whole does not\r\nobviate the difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"Accordingly in preparing to mount _Tyrannosaurus_ for exhibition a\r\nnew method has been adopted, namely, to _prepare a scale model of\r\nevery bone in the skeleton_ and mount this small skeleton with\r\nflexible joints and parts so that all studies and experiments as to\r\npose can be made with the models.\r\n\r\n\"This difficult and delicate undertaking was entrusted to Mr. Erwin\r\nChristman of the artistic staff of the Department of Vertebrate\r\nPalaeontology of the Museum, who has prepared two very exact models to\r\na one-sixth scale, representing our two skeletons of _Tyrannosaurus\r\nrex_, which fortunately are of exactly the same size. A series of\r\nthree experiments by Mr. Christman on the pose of _Tyrannosaurus_,\r\nunder the direction of the author and Curator Matthew, were not\r\nsatisfactory. The advice of Mr. Raymond L. Ditmars, Curator of\r\nReptiles in the New York Zoological Park, was sought and we thus\r\nobtained the fourth pose, which is shown in the photographs published\r\nherewith.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 15.--Model of _Tyrannosaurus_ group for the\r\n  Cretaceous Dinosaur Hall.]\r\n\r\n\"The fourth pose or study, for the proposed full sized mount, is that\r\nof two reptiles of the same size attracted to the same prey. One\r\nreptile is crouching over its prey (which is represented by a portion\r\nof a skeleton). The object of this depressed pose is to bring the\r\nperfectly preserved skull and pelvis very near the ground within easy\r\nreach of the visiting observer. The second reptile is advancing, and\r\nattains very nearly the full height of the animal. The general effect\r\nof this group is the best that can be had and is very realistic,\r\nparticularly the crouching figure. A fifth study will embody some\r\nfurther changes. The upright figure is not well balanced and will be\r\nmore effective with the feet closer together, the legs straighter and\r\nthe body more erect. These reptiles have a series of strong abdominal\r\nribs not shown in the models. The fourth position places the pelvis in\r\nan almost impossible position as will be noted from the ischium and\r\npubis.\r\n\r\n\"The lateral view of this fourth pose represents the animals just\r\nprior to the convulsive single spring and tooth grip which\r\ndistinguishes the combat of reptiles from that of all mammals,\r\naccording to Mr. Ditmars.\r\n\r\n\"The rear view of the standing skeleton displays the peculiarly avian\r\nstructure of the iliac junction with the sacral plate, characteristic\r\nof these very highly specialized dinosaurs, also the marked reduction\r\nof the upper end of the median metatarsal bone, which formerly was\r\nbelieved to be peculiar to _Ornithomimus_.\"\r\n\r\nThis model of the group is on exhibition with the mounted skeleton.\r\n\r\nAs compared with its predecessor _Allosaurus_, the _Tyrannosaurus_ is\r\nmuch more massively proportioned throughout. The skull is more solid,\r\nthe jaws much deeper and more powerful, the fore limb much smaller,\r\nthe tail shorter, the hind limb straighter and the foot bones more\r\ncompacted so that the animal was more strictly \"digitigrade,\"\r\napproaching the ostriches more closely in this particular.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 16.--SKELETON OF TYRANNOSAURUS IN COMPARISON\r\n  WITH HUMAN SKELETON.]\r\n\r\nThis animal probably reached the maximum of size and of development of\r\nteeth and claws of which its type of animal mechanism was capable. Its\r\nbulk precluded quickness and agility. It must have been designed to\r\nattack and prey upon the ponderous and slow moving Horned and Armored\r\nDinosaurs with which its remains are found, and whose massive cuirass\r\nand weapons of defense are well matched with its teeth and claws. The\r\nmomentum of its huge body involved a seemingly slow and lumbering\r\naction, an inertia of its movements, difficult to start and difficult\r\nto shift or to stop. Such movements are widely different from the\r\nagile swiftness which we naturally associate with a beast of prey. But\r\nan animal which exceeds an average elephant in bulk, no matter what\r\nits habits, is compelled by the laws of mechanics to the ponderous\r\nmovements appropriate to its gigantic size. These movements, directed\r\nand controlled by a reptilian brain, must needs be largely automatic\r\nand instinctive. We cannot doubt indeed that the Carnivorous Dinosaurs\r\ndeveloped, along with their elaborately perfected mechanism for\r\nattack, an equally elaborate series of instincts guiding their action\r\nto effective purpose; and a complex series of automatic responses to\r\nthe stimulus afforded by the sight and action of their prey might\r\nvery well mimic intelligent pursuit and attack, always with certain\r\nlimits set by the inflexible character of such automatic adjustments.\r\nBut no animal as large as _Tyrannosaurus_ could leap or spring upon\r\nanother, and its slow stride quickening into a swift resistless rush,\r\nmight well end in unavoidable impalement upon the great horns of\r\n_Triceratops_, futile weapons against a small and active enemy, but\r\ndesigned no doubt to meet just such attacks as these. A true picture\r\nof these combats of titans of the ancient world we cannot draw;\r\nperhaps we will never be able to reconstruct it. But the above\r\nconsiderations may serve to show how widely it would differ from the\r\npictures based upon any modern analogies.\r\n\r\nOne may well inquire why it is that no such gigantic carnivora have\r\nevolved among the mammalian land animals. The largest predaceous\r\nquadrupeds living today are the lion and tiger. The bears although\r\nsome of them are much larger, are not generally carnivorous, except\r\nfor the polar bear, which is partly aquatic, preying chiefly upon\r\nseals and fish. There are indeed carnivorous whales of gigantic size,\r\nbut no very large land carnivore. There were, it is true, during the\r\nTertiary and Pleistocene, lions and other carnivores considerably\r\nlarger than the living species. But none of them attained the size of\r\ntheir largest herbivorous contemporaries, or even approached it. Among\r\nthe dinosaurs on the other hand we find that--setting aside\r\nBrontosaurus and its allies as aquatic--the predaceous kinds equalled\r\nor exceeded the largest of the herbivorous sorts. The difference is\r\nstriking, and it does not seem likely that it is merely accidental.\r\n\r\nThe explanation lies probably in the fact that the large herbivorous\r\nmammals are much more intelligent and active, and would be able to use\r\ntheir weapons of defense so as to defy the attacks of relatively slow\r\nmoving giant beasts of prey, as they do also the more active but less\r\npowerful assaults of smaller ones. The elephant or the rhinoceros is\r\nin fact practically immune from the attacks of carnivora, and would\r\nstill be so were the carnivora to increase in size. The large modern\r\ncarnivora prey upon herbivores of medium or smaller size, which they\r\nare active enough to surprise or run down. Carnivora of much larger\r\nsize would be too slow and heavy in movements to catch small prey,\r\nwhile the larger herbivores by intelligent use of their defensive\r\nweapons could still fend them off successfully. In consequence giant\r\ncarnivores would find no field for action in the Cenozoic world, and\r\nhence they have not been evolved.\r\n\r\nBut the giant herbivorous dinosaurs, well armed or well defended\r\nthough they were, had not the intelligence to use those weapons\r\neffectively under all circumstances. Thus they might be successfully\r\nattacked, at least sometimes, by the powerful although slow moving\r\nMegalosaurians.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion has also been made that these giant carnivores were\r\ncarrion-eaters rather than truly predaceous. The hypothesis can hardly\r\nbe effectively supported nor attacked. It is presented as a possible\r\nalternate.\r\n\r\n_Albertosaurus._ Closely allied to the _Tyrannosaurus_ but smaller,\r\nabout equal in size to _Allosaurus_, was the _Albertosaurus_ of the\r\nEdmonton formation in Canada. It is somewhat older than the Tyrannosaur\r\nalthough still of the late Cretacic period, and may have been ancestral\r\nto it. A fine series of limbs and feet as also skull, tail, etc., are\r\nin the Museum's collections. At or about this time carnivorous\r\ndinosaurs of slightly smaller size are known to have inhabited New\r\nJersey; a fragmentary skeleton of one secured by Professor Cope in 1869\r\nwas described as _Laelaps_ (=_Dryptosaurus_).[10]\r\n\r\n_Ornitholestes._ In contrast with the _Allosaurus_ and _Tyrannosaurus_\r\nthis skeleton represents the smaller and more agile carnivorous\r\ndinosaurs which preyed upon the lesser herbivorous reptiles of the\r\nperiod. These little dinosaurs were probably common during all the Age\r\nof Reptiles, much as the smaller quadrupeds are today, but skulls or\r\nskeletons are rarely found in the formations known to us. The\r\n_Anchisaurus_, _Podokesaurus_ and other genera of the Triassic Period\r\nhave left innumerable tracks upon the sandy shales of the Newark\r\nformation, but only two or three skeletons are known. A cast of one\r\nof them is exhibited here. The original is preserved in the Yale\r\nMuseum. In the succeeding Jurassic Period we have the _Compsognathus_,\r\nsmallest of known dinosaurs, and this _Ornitholestes_ some six feet\r\nlong. A cast of the _Compsognathus_ skeleton is shown, the original\r\nfound in the lithographic limestone of Solenhofen is preserved in the\r\nMunich Museum. The _Ornitholestes_ is from the Bone-Cabin Quarry in\r\nWyoming. The forefoot with its long slender digits is supposed to have\r\nbeen adapted for grasping an active and elusive prey, and the name\r\n(_Ornitho-lestes_ = bird-robber) indicates that that prey may\r\nsometimes have been the primitive birds which were its contemporaries.\r\nIn the Cretacic Period, there were also small and medium sized\r\ncarnivorous dinosaurs, contemporary with the gigantic kinds; a\r\ncomplete skeleton of _Ornithomimus_ at the entrance to the Dinosaur\r\nHall finely illustrates this group. In appearance most of these small\r\ndinosaurs must have suggested long-legged bipedal lizards, running and\r\nwalking on their hind limbs, with the long tail stretched out behind\r\nto balance the body. From what we know of their tracks it seems that\r\nthey walked or ran with a narrow treadway, the footsteps almost in the\r\nmiddle line of progress. They did not hop like perching birds, nor did\r\nthey waddle like most living reptiles. Occasionally the tail or fore\r\nfeet touched the ground as they walked; and when they sat down, they\r\nrested on the end of the pubic bones and on the tail. So much we can\r\ninfer from the footprint impressions. The general appearance is shown\r\nin the restorations of _Ornitholestes_, _Compsognathus_ and\r\n_Anchisaurus_ by Charles Knight.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 17.--Skeleton of _Ornitholestes_ a small\r\n  carnivorous dinosaur of the Jurassic period.

It is\r\nexceptionally complete, and has been mounted as a panel, in position\r\nas it lay in the rock, and with considerable parts of the original\r\nsandstone matrix still adherent. The long slender limbs, long neck,\r\nsmall head and toothless jaws are all singularly bird-like, and afford\r\na striking contrast to the Tyrannosaurus. At the time of writing, its\r\nadaptation and relationships have not yet been thoroughly\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 19.--MOUNTED SKELETON OF BRONTOSAURUS IN THE\r\n  AMERICAN MUSEUM.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: This is still doubtful in _Tyrannosaurus_.

In contrast to\r\nthe carnivorous dinosaurs these are quadrupedal, with very small head,\r\nblunt teeth, long giraffe-like neck, elephantine body and limbs, long\r\nmassive tail prolonged at the tip into a whip-lash as in the lizards.\r\nLike the elephant they have five short toes on each foot, probably\r\nburied in life in a large soft pad, but the inner digits bear large\r\nclaws, blunt like those of turtles, one in the fore foot, three in the\r\nhind foot.\r\n\r\nTo this group belong the Brontosaurus and Diplodocus, the\r\nCamarasaurus, Morosaurus and other less known kinds. All of them lived\r\nduring the late Jurassic and Comanchic (\"Lower Cretaceous\") and belong\r\nto the older of the two principal Dinosaur faunas. They were\r\ncontemporaries of the Allosaurus and Megalosaurus, the Stegosaurus and\r\nIguanodon, but unlike the Carnivorous and Beaked Dinosaurs they\r\nbecame wholly extinct before the Upper or true Cretacic, and left no\r\nrelatives to take part in the final epoch of expansion and prosperity\r\nof the dinosaurian race at the close of the Reptilian era.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 20.--Skeletons of _Brontosaurus_ (above) and\r\n  _Diplodocus_ (below) in the American Museum. The parts preserved\r\n  in these specimens are shaded. Scale, 10 feet=1 inch.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBRONTOSAURUS.\r\n\r\nThe following description of the Brontosaurus skeleton in the American\r\nMuseum was first published in the American Museum Journal of April,\r\n1905:[11]\r\n\r\n\"The Brontosaurus skeleton, the principal feature of the hall, is\r\nsixty-six feet eight inches long. (The weight of the animal when alive\r\nis estimated by W.K. Gregory at 38 tons). About one-third of the\r\nskeleton including the skull is restored in plaster modelled or cast\r\nfrom other incomplete skeletons. The remaining two-thirds belong to\r\none individual, except for a part of the tail, one shoulder-blade and\r\none hind limb, supplied from another skeleton of the same species.\r\n\r\n\"The skeleton was discovered by Mr. Walter Granger of the Museum\r\nexpedition of 1898, about nine miles north of Medicine Bow, Wyoming.\r\nIt took the whole of the succeeding summer to extract it from the\r\nrock, pack it, and ship it to the Museum. Nearly two years were\r\nconsumed in removing the matrix, piecing together and cementing the\r\nbrittle and shattered petrified bone, strengthening it so that it\r\nwould bear handling, and restoring the missing parts of the bones in\r\ntinted plaster. The articulation and mounting of the skeleton and\r\nmodelling of the missing bones took an even longer time, so that it\r\nwas not until February, 1905, that the Brontosaurus was at last ready\r\nfor exhibition.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 21.--Excavating the _Brontosaurus_ skeleton.\r\n  The upper photograph shows the anterior ribs of one side still\r\n  lying in position. The backbone is being prepared for removal, the\r\n  sections each containing three vertebrae, partly cased in plaster\r\n  and burlap (see chapter XI.) The lower photograph shows a later\r\n  stage of progress, the blocks being undercut and nearly ready to\r\n  turn over and incase the under side. Strips of wood have been\r\n  pasted into each section to strengthen it.]\r\n\r\n\"It will appear, therefore, that the collection, preparation and\r\nmounting of this gigantic fossil has been a task of extraordinary\r\ndifficulty. No museum has ever before attempted to mount so large a\r\nfossil skeleton, and the great weight and fragile character of the\r\nbones made it necessary to devise especial methods to give each bone a\r\nrigid and complete support as otherwise it would soon break in pieces\r\nfrom its own weight. The proper articulating of the bones and posing\r\nof the limbs were equally difficult problems, for the Amphibious\r\nDinosaurs, to which this animal belongs, disappeared from the earth\r\nlong before the dawn of the Age of Mammals, and their nearest\r\nrelatives, the living lizards, crocodiles, etc., are so remote from\r\nthem in either proportions or habits that they are unsatisfactory\r\nguides in determining how the bones were articulated and are of but\r\nlittle use in posing the limbs and other parts of the body in\r\npositions that they must have taken during life. Nor among the higher\r\nanimals of modern times is there one which has any analogy in\r\nappearance or habits of life to those which we have been obliged by\r\nthe study of the skeleton to ascribe to the Brontosaurus.\r\n\r\n\"As far as the backbone and ribs were concerned, the articulating\r\nsurfaces of the bones were a sufficient guide to enable us to pose\r\nthis part of the skeleton properly. The limb joints, however, are so\r\nimperfect that we could not in this way make sure of having the bones\r\nin a correct position. The following method, therefore, was adopted.\r\n\r\n\"A dissection and thorough study was made by the writer, with the\r\nassistance of Mr. Granger, of the limbs of alligators and other\r\nreptiles, and the position, size and action of the principal muscles\r\nwere carefully worked out. Then the corresponding bones of the\r\nBrontosaurus were studied, and the position and size of the\r\ncorresponding muscles were worked out, so far as they could be\r\nrecognized from the scars and processes preserved on the bone. The\r\nBrontosaurus limbs were then provisionally articulated and posed, and\r\nthe position and size of each muscle were represented by a broad strip\r\nof paper extending from its origin to its insertion. The action and\r\nplay of the muscles on the limb of the Brontosaurus could then be\r\nstudied, and the bones adjusted until a proper and mechanically\r\ncorrect pose was reached. The limbs were then permanently mounted in\r\nthese poses, and the skeleton as it stands is believed to represent,\r\nas nearly as study of the fossil enables us to know, a characteristic\r\nposition that the animal actually assumed during life....\r\n\r\n\"In proportions and appearance the Brontosaurus was quite unlike any\r\nliving animal. It had a long thick tail like the lizards and\r\ncrocodiles, a long, flexible neck like an ostrich, a thick short,\r\nslab-sided body and straight, massive, post-like limbs suggesting the\r\nelephant, and a remarkably small head for the size of the beast. The\r\nribs, limb-bones and tail-bones are exceptionally solid and heavy; the\r\nvertebrae of the back and neck, and the skull, on the contrary are\r\nconstructed so as to combine the minimum of weight with the large\r\nsurface necessary for the attachment of the huge muscles, the largest\r\npossible articulating surfaces, and the necessary strength at all\r\npoints of strain. For this purpose they are constructed with an\r\nelaborate system of braces and buttresses of thin bony plates\r\nconnecting the broad articulating surfaces and muscular attachments,\r\nall the bone between these thin plates being hollowed into a\r\ncomplicated system of air-cavities. This remarkable structure can be\r\nbest seen in the unmounted skeleton of _Camarasaurus_, another\r\nAmphibious Dinosaur.\" (The scientific name _Camarasaurus_=chambered\r\nlizard, has reference to this peculiarity of construction.)\r\n\r\n\"The teeth of the Brontosaurus indicate that it was an herbivorous\r\nanimal, feeding on soft vegetable food. Three opinions as to the\r\nhabitat of Amphibious Dinosaurs have been held by scientific\r\nauthorities. The first, advocated by Professor Owen, who described the\r\nfirst specimens found sixty years ago (1841-60) and supported\r\nespecially by Professor Cope, has been most generally adopted. This\r\nregards the animals as spending their lives entirely in shallow water,\r\npartly immersed, wading about on the bottom, or perhaps occasionally\r\nswimming, but unable to emerge entirely upon dry land.[12] More\r\nrecently, Professor Osborn has advocated the view that they resorted\r\noccasionally to the land for egg laying or other purposes, and still\r\nmore recently the view has been taken by Mr. Riggs and the late\r\nProfessor Hatcher that they were chiefly terrestrial animals. The\r\nwriter inclines to the view of Owen and Cope, whose unequalled\r\nknowledge of comparative anatomy renders their opinion on this\r\ndoubtful question especially authoritative.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 22.--RESTORATION OF BRONTOSAURUS BY C.R.\r\n  KNIGHT, UNDER DIRECTION OF PROFESSOR OSBORN. _After Osborn_]\r\n\r\n\"The contrast between the massive structure of the limb-bones, ribs\r\nand tail, and the light construction of the backbone, neck and skull,\r\nsuggests that the animal was amphibious, living chiefly in shallow\r\nwater, where it could wade about on the bottom, feeding upon the\r\nabundant vegetation of the coastal swamps and marshes, and pretty much\r\nout of reach of the powerful and active Carnivorous Dinosaurs which\r\nwere its principal enemies. The water would buoy up the massive body\r\nand prevent its weight from pressing too heavily on the imperfect\r\njoints of the limb and foot bones, which were covered during life with\r\nthick cartilage, like the joints of whales, sea-lizards and other\r\naquatic animals. If the full weight of the animal came on these\r\nimperfect joints the cartilage would yield and the ends of the bones\r\nwould grind against each other, thus preventing the limb from moving\r\nwithout tearing the joint to pieces. The massive, solid limb and foot\r\nbones weighted the limbs while immersed in water, and served the same\r\npurpose as the lead in a diver's shoes, enabling the Brontosaurus to\r\nwalk about firmly and securely under water. On the other hand, the\r\njoints of the neck and back are exceptionally broad, well fitting and\r\ncovered with a much thinner surface of cartilage. The pressure was\r\nthus much better distributed over the joint, and the full weight of\r\nthe part of the animal above water (reduced as it was by the cellular\r\nconstruction of the bones) might be borne on these joints without the\r\ncartilage giving way.\r\n\r\n\"Looking at the mounted skeleton we may see that if a line be drawn\r\nfrom the hip joint to the shoulder-blade, all the bones below this are\r\nmassive, all above (including neck and head) are lightly constructed.\r\nThis line may be taken to indicate the average water-line, so to\r\nspeak, of this Leviathan of the Shallows. The long neck would enable\r\nthe animal, however, to wade to a considerable depth, and it might\r\nforage for food either in the branches or the tops of trees, or more\r\nprobably, among the soft succulent water-plants of the bottom. The row\r\nof short spoon-shaped stubby teeth around the front of the mouth would\r\nserve to bite or pull off soft leaves and water-plants, but the animal\r\nevidently could not masticate its food, and must have swallowed it\r\nwithout chewing as do modern reptiles and birds.\r\n\r\n\"The brain-case occupies only a small part of the back of the skull,\r\nso that the brain must have been small even for a reptile, and its\r\norganization (as inferred from the form of the brain-case) indicates a\r\nvery low grade of intelligence. Much larger than the brain proper was\r\nthe spinal cord, especially in the region of the sacrum, controlling\r\nmost of the reflex and involuntary actions of the huge organism. Hence\r\nwe can best regard the Brontosaurus as a great, slow-moving animal\r\nautomaton, a vast storehouse of organized matter directed chiefly or\r\nsolely by instinct, and to a very limited degree, if at all, by\r\nconscious intelligence. Its huge size and its imperfect organization,\r\ncompared with the great quadrupeds of today, rendered its movements\r\nslow and clumsy; its small and low brain shows that it must have been\r\nautomatic, instinctive and unintelligent.\"\r\n\r\n_Composition of the Brontosaurus Skeleton._ \"The principal specimen,\r\nNo. 460, is from the Nine Mile Crossing of the Little Medicine Bow\r\nRiver, Wyoming. It consists of the 5th, 6th, and 8th to 13th cervical\r\nvertebrae, 1st to 9th dorsal and 3rd to 19th caudal vertebrae, all the\r\nribs, both coracoids, parts of sacrum and ilia, both ischia and pubes,\r\nleft femur and astragalus, and part of left fibula. The backbone and\r\nmost of the neck of this specimen were found articulated together in\r\nthe quarry, the ribs of one side in position, the remainder of the\r\nbones scattered around them, and some of the tail bones weathered out\r\non the surface.\r\n\r\n\"From No. 222, found at Como Bluffs, Wyo., were supplied the right\r\nscapula, 10th dorsal vertebra, and right femur and tibia.\r\n\r\n\"No. 339, from Bone-Cabin Quarry, Wyoming, supplied the 20th to 40th\r\ncaudal vertebrae, No. 592, from the same locality the metatarsals of\r\nthe right hind foot; and a few toe bones are supplied from other\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 23.--Skull of _Diplodocus_ from Bone-Cabin\r\n  Quarry, north of Medicine Bow, Wyoming.]\r\n\r\n\"The remainder of the skeleton is modelled in plaster, the scapula,\r\nhumerus, radius and ulna from the skeleton in the Yale Museum, the\r\nrest principally from specimens in our own collections. The modelling\r\nof the skull is based partly upon specimens in the Yale Museum, but\r\nprincipally upon the complete skull of Morosaurus shown in another\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\"Mounted by A. Hermann, completed Feb. 10, 1905.\"\r\n\r\n_Diplodocus._ The _Diplodocus_ nearly equalled the Brontosaurus in\r\nbulk and exceeded it in length. A skeleton in the Carnegie Museum at\r\nPittsburgh measures 87 feet in total length; although the mount is\r\ncomposed from several individuals these proportions are probably not\r\nfar from correct. The skull is smaller and differently shaped and the\r\nteeth are of quite different type. In the American Museum of Natural\r\nHistory, a partial skeleton is exhibited in the wall case to the left\r\nof the entrance of the Dinosaur Hall, and in an A-case near by are\r\nskulls of _Diplodocus_ and _Morosaurus_ and a model of the skull of\r\n_Brontosaurus_. The Diplodocus skull is widely different from the\r\nother two in size and proportions and in the characters of teeth.\r\n\r\nWhen the first remains of these amphibious Dinosaurs were found in the\r\nOxford Clays of England, they were considered by Richard Owen to be\r\nrelated to the Crocodiles, and named Opisthocoelia. Subsequently the\r\nfinding of complete skeletons in this country led Cope and Marsh to\r\nplace them with the true Dinosaurs and the latter named them\r\nSauropoda.[13] Remains of these animals have also been found in India,\r\nin German East Africa, in Madagascar, and in South America, so that\r\nthey were evidently widely distributed. In the Northern world they\r\nsurvived until the Comanchic or Lower Cretaceous Period, but in the\r\nsouthern continents they may have lived on into the Upper Cretaceous\r\nor true Cretacic. Some of the remains recently found in German East\r\nAfrica indicate an animal exceeding either _Brontosaurus_ or\r\n_Diplodocus_ in bulk.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 24.--The Largest Known Dinosaur. Sketch\r\n  reconstruction of _Brachiosaurus_, from specimens in the Field\r\n  Museum in Chicago, and the Natural History Museum in Berlin.]\r\n\r\nAt the date of writing this handbook only preliminary accounts have\r\nbeen given of the marvellous finds made near Tendaguru by the\r\nexpedition from Berlin. From these it appears that in length of neck\r\nand fore limb this East African Dinosaur greatly exceeded either\r\n_Brontosaurus_ or _Diplodocus_. The hinder parts of the skeleton\r\nhowever, were relatively small. The proportions and measurements given\r\ntally closely with the American _Brachiosaurus_, a gigantic sauropod\r\nwhose incomplete remains are preserved in the Field Museum in Chicago\r\nand to this genus the Berlin authorities now refer their largest and\r\nfinest skeleton. If the Berlin specimens are correctly referred to\r\n_Brachiosaurus_ they indicate an animal somewhat exceeding\r\n_Diplodocus_ or _Brontosaurus_ in total bulk but distinguished by much\r\nlonger fore limbs and an immensely long neck--a giraffe-like wader\r\nadapted to take refuge in deeper waters, more out of reach of the\r\nfierce carnivores of the land.[14]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: The mounted Skeleton of Brontosaurus, by W.D.

This difference is\r\ncorrelated by Professor Williston with the longer fore limbs of the\r\nBrachiosaurus, as signifying that the animal was less able, as indeed\r\nhe had less need, to rise up upon the hind limbs, in comparison with\r\nDiplodocus or Brontosaurus in which the fore limbs were relatively\r\nshort.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE BEAKED DINOSAURS.\r\n\r\nORDER ORTHOPODA (ORNITHISCHIA OR PREDENTATA.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peculiar feature of this group of Dinosaurs is the horny beak or\r\nbill. The bony core sutured to the front of the upper and lower jaws\r\nwas covered in life by a horny sheath, as in birds or turtles. But\r\nthis is not the only feature in which they came nearer to birds than\r\ndo the other Dinosaurs. The pelvic or hip bones are much more\r\nbird-like in many respects, especially the backward direction of the\r\npubic bone, the presence of a prepubis, in the number of vertebrae\r\ncoössified into a solid sacrum, in the proportions of the ilium and so\r\non. Various features in the anatomy of the head, shoulder-blades and\r\nhind limbs are equally suggestive of birds, and it seems probable that\r\nthe earliest ancestors of the birds were very closely related to the\r\nancestors of this group of Dinosaurs. But the ancestral birds became\r\nadapted to flying, the ancestral Predentates to terrestrial life, and\r\nin their later development became as widely diversified in form and\r\nhabits as the warm-blooded quadrupeds which succeeded them in the Age\r\nof Mammals.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 25.--Skulls of Iguanodont and Trachodont\r\n  Dinosaurs. _Iguanodon_ and _Camptosaurus_ of the Jurassic and\r\n  Comanchic; _Kritosaurus_ and _Corythosaurus_ of the Middle\r\n  Cretacic (Belly River); _Saurolophus_ of the late Cretacic\r\n  (Edmonton); _Trachodon_ of the latest Cretacic (Lance). The\r\n  Iguanodon is European, the others North American. All 1/25 natural\r\n  size.]\r\n\r\nThese Beaked Dinosaurs were, so far as we can tell, all vegetarians.\r\nUnlike the birds, they retained their teeth and in some cases\r\nconverted them into a grinding apparatus which served the same purpose\r\nas the grinders of herbivorous quadrupeds. It is interesting to\r\nobserve the different way in which this result is attained. In the\r\nmammals the teeth, originally more complex in construction and fewer\r\nin number, are converted into efficient grinders by infolding and\r\nelongation of the crown of each tooth so as to produce on the wearing\r\nsurface a complex pattern of enamel ridges with softer dentine or\r\ncement intervening, making a series of crests and hollows continually\r\nrenewed during the wear of the tooth. In the reptile the teeth,\r\noriginally simple in construction but more numerous and continually\r\nrenewed as they wear down and fall out,[15] are banked up in several\r\nclose packed rows, the enamel borders and softer dentine giving a\r\nwearing surface of alternating crests and hollows continually renewed,\r\nand reinforced from time to time, by the addition of new rows of teeth\r\nto one side, as the first formed rows wear down to the roots. This is\r\nthe best illustrated in the _Trachodon_ (see fig. 27); the other\r\ngroups have not so perfect a mechanism.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. THE IGUANODONTS: IGUANODON, CAMPTOSAURUS.\r\n\r\n_Sub-Order Ornithopoda or Iguanodontia._\r\n\r\nIn the early days of geology, about the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, bones and footprints of huge extinct reptiles were found in\r\nthe rocks of the Weald in south-eastern England. They were described\r\nby Mantell and Owen and shown to pertain to an extinct group of\r\nreptiles which Owen called the Dinosauria. So different were these\r\nbones from those of any modern reptiles that even the anatomical\r\nlearning of the great English palaeontologist did not enable him to\r\nplace them all correctly or reconstruct the true proportions of the\r\nanimal to which they belonged. With them were found associated the\r\nbones of the great carnivorous dinosaur _Megalosaurus_; and the weird\r\nreconstructions of these animals, based by Waterhouse Hawkins upon the\r\nimperfect knowledge and erroneous ideas then prevailing, must be\r\nfamiliar to many of the older readers of this handbook. Life size\r\nrestorations of these and other extinct animals were erected in the\r\ngrounds of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, London, and in Central\r\nPark, New York. Those in London still exist, so far as the writer is\r\naware, but the stern mandate of a former mayor of New York ordered the\r\ndestruction of the Central Park models, not indeed as incorrect\r\nscientifically, but as inconsistent with the doctrines of revealed\r\nreligion, and they were accordingly broken up and thrown into the\r\nwaters of the Park lake. Small replicas of these early attempts at\r\nrestoring dinosaurs may still be seen in some of the older museums in\r\nthis country and abroad.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 26.--SKELETON OF CAMPTOSAURUS, AN AMERICAN\r\n  RELATIVE OF THE IGUANODON.]\r\n\r\nThe real construction of the Iguanodon was gradually built up by later\r\ndiscoveries, and in 1877 an extraordinary find in a coal mine at\r\nBernissart in Belgium brought to light no less than seventeen\r\nskeletons more or less complete. These were found in an ancient\r\nfissure filled with rocks of Comanchic age, traversing the\r\nCarboniferous strata in which the coal seam lay, and with them were\r\nskeletons of other extinct reptiles of smaller size. The open fissure\r\nhad evidently served as a trap into which these ancient giants had\r\nfallen, and either killed by the fall or unable to escape from the\r\npit, their remains had been subsequently covered up by sediments and\r\nthe pit filled in to remain sealed up until the present day. These\r\nskeletons, unique in their occurrence and manner of discovery, are the\r\npride of the Brussels Museum of Natural History, and, together with\r\nthe earlier discoveries, have made the _Iguanodon_ the most familiar\r\ntype of dinosaur to the people of England and Western Europe.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 27.--Teeth of the duck-billed dinosaur\r\n  _Trachodon_. The dental magazine has been removed from the lower\r\n  jaw and is seen to consist of several close-set rows of numerous\r\n  small pencil-like teeth which are pushed up from beneath as they\r\n  wear off at the grinding surface.]\r\n\r\n_Camptosaurus._ The American counterpart of the Iguanodons of Europe\r\nwas the _Camptosaurus_, nearly related and generally similar in\r\nproportions but including mostly smaller species, and lacking some of\r\nthe peculiar features of the Old World genus. In the National Museum\r\nat Washington, are mounted two skeletons of _Camptosaurus_, a large\r\nand a small species, and in the American Museum a skeleton of a small\r\nspecies. It suggests a large kangaroo in size and proportions, but the\r\nthree-toed feet, with hoof-like claws, the reptilian skull, loosely\r\nput together, with lizard-like cheek teeth and turtle beak indicate a\r\nnear relative of the great _Iguanodon_.\r\n\r\n_Thescelosaurus._ The Iguanodont family survived until the close of\r\nthe Age of Reptiles, with no great change in proportions or\r\ncharacters. Its latest member is _Thescelosaurus_, a contemporary of\r\n_Triceratops_. Partial skeletons of this animal are shown in the\r\nDinosaur Hall; a more complete one is in the National Museum.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Trachodont teeth never drop out, they are completely\r\nconsumed. Only in the Iguanodonts and Ceratopsia are they shed.--B.\r\nBrown.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE BEAKED DINOSAURS (Continued).\r\n\r\nB. THE DUCK BILLED DINOSAURS,--TRACHODON, SAUROLOPHUS, ETC.\r\n\r\n_Sub-Order Ornithopoda; Family Trachodontidæ._\r\n\r\n\r\nThese animals of the Upper Cretaceous are probably descended from the\r\nIguanodonts of an older period. But the long ages that intervened,\r\nsome millions of years, have brought about various changes in the\r\nrace, not so much in general proportions as in altering the form and\r\nrelations of various bones of skull and skeleton and perfecting their\r\nadaptation to a somewhat different habit of life, so that they must be\r\nregarded as descendants perhaps, but certainly rather distant\r\nrelatives, of the older group.\r\n\r\nWe know more about the Trachodonts than any other dinosaurs. For not\r\nonly are the skeletons more frequently found articulated, but parts of\r\nthe skin are not uncommonly preserved with them, and in one specimen\r\nat least, so much of the skin is preserved that it may fairly be\r\ncalled a \"dinosaur mummy.\" This specimen of _Trachodon_ is in the\r\nAmerican Museum, and beside it are two fine mounted skeletons of the\r\nlargest size. There is also on exhibition a panel mount of a nearly\r\nrelated genus, _Saurolophus_ the skeleton lying as it was found in the\r\nrock, and a fine skeleton of a third genus _Corythosaurus_ with the\r\nskin partly preserved on both sides of the crushed and flattened body\r\nstands beside it. In the _Tyrannosaurus_ group when completed will\r\nappear a fourth skeleton of the _Trachodon_. Several skulls and\r\nincomplete skeletons on exhibition and other skeletons not yet\r\nprepared add to the Museum collection of this group. Trachodon\r\nskeletons may also be found in the Museums of New Haven, Washington,\r\nFrankfurt-on-the-Main, London and Paris, but nowhere a series\r\ncomparable to that displayed at the American Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRACHODON GROUP.\r\n\r\nThe following description of the Trachodon group is by Mr. Barnum\r\nBrown and first appeared in the American Museum Journal for April\r\n1908:[16]\r\n\r\n\"This group takes us back in imagination to the Cretaceous period,\r\nmore than three millions of years ago, when Trachodonts were among the\r\nmost numerous of the dinosaurs. Two members of the family are\r\nrepresented here as feeding in the marshes that characterized the\r\nperiod, when one is startled by the approach of a carnivorous\r\ndinosaur, Tyrannosaurus, their enemy, and rises on tiptoe to look over\r\nthe surrounding plants and determine the direction from which it is\r\ncoming. The other Trachodon, unaware of danger, continues peacefully\r\nto crop the foliage. Perhaps the erect member of the group had already\r\nhad unpleasant experiences with hostile beasts, for a bone of its left\r\nfoot bears three sharp gashes which were made by the teeth of some\r\ncarnivorous dinosaur.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 28.--Mounted Skeletons of _Trachodon_ in the\r\n  American Museum. Height of standing skeleton 16 feet, 10 inches.]\r\n\r\n\"By thus grouping the skeletons in lifelike attitudes, the relation of\r\nthe different bones can best be shown, but these of course are only\r\ntwo of the attitudes commonly taken by the creatures during life.\r\nMechanical and anatomical considerations, especially the long straight\r\nshafts of the leg bones, indicate that dinosaurs walked with their\r\nlimbs straight under the body, rather than in a crawling attitude with\r\nthe belly close to the ground, as is common among living reptiles.\r\n\r\n\"Trachodonts lived near the close of the Age of Reptiles in the Upper\r\nCretaceous and had a wide geographical distribution, their remains\r\nhaving been found in New Jersey, Mississippi and Alabama, but more\r\ncommonly in Wyoming, Montana, and the Dakotas. A suggestion of the\r\ngreat antiquity of these specimens is given by the fact that since the\r\nanimals died layers of rock aggregating many thousand feet in vertical\r\nthickness have been deposited along the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\n\"The bones of the erect specimen are but little crushed and a clear\r\nconception of the proportions of the animal can best be obtained from\r\nthis specimen. It will be seen that the Trachodon was shaped somewhat\r\nlike a kangaroo, with short fore legs, long hind legs, and a long\r\ntail. The fore limbs are reduced indeed to about one-sixth the size of\r\nthe hind limbs and judging from the size and shape of the foot bones\r\nthe front legs could not have borne much weight. They were probably\r\nused in supporting the anterior portion of the body when the creature\r\nwas feeding, and in aiding it to recover an upright position. The\r\nspecimen represented as feeding is posed so that the fore legs carry\r\nvery little of the weight of the body. There are four toes on the\r\nfront foot but the thumb is greatly reduced and the fifth digit or\r\nlittle finger, is absent.\" (Subsequent discoveries have shown that the\r\narrangement of the digits made by Marsh and followed in this skeleton\r\nis incorrect. It is the first digit that is absent, and the fifth is\r\nreduced.)\r\n\r\n\"The hind legs are massive and have three well developed toes ending\r\nin broad hoofs. The pelvis is lightly constructed with bones elongated\r\nlike those of birds. The long deep compressed tail was particularly\r\nadapted for locomotion in the water. It may also have served to\r\nbalance the creature when standing erect on shore. The broad expanded\r\nlip of bone known as the fourth trochanter, on the inner posterior\r\nface of the femur or thigh bone was for the attachment of powerful\r\ntail muscles similar to those which enable the crocodile to move its\r\ntail from side to side with such dexterity. This trochanter is absent\r\nfrom the thigh bones of land-inhabiting dinosaurs with short tails,\r\nsuch as _Stegosaurus_ and _Triceratops_. The tail muscles were\r\nattached to the vertebrae by numerous rod-like tendons which are\r\npreserved in position as fossils on the erect skeleton. Trachodonts\r\nare thought to have been expert swimmers. Unlike other dinosaurs their\r\nremains are frequently found in rocks that were formed under sea\r\nwater probably bordering the shores but nevertheless containing\r\ntypical sea shells.\r\n\r\n\"The elaborate dental apparatus is such as to show clearly that\r\nTrachodonts were strictly herbivorous creatures. The mouth was\r\nexpanded to form a broad duck-like bill which during life was covered\r\nwith a horny sheath, as in birds and turtles. Each jaw is provided\r\nwith from 45 to 60 vertical and from 10 to 14 horizontal rows of\r\nteeth, so that there were more than 2000 teeth altogether in both\r\njaws.\r\n\r\n\"Among living saurians, or reptiles, the small South American iguana\r\n_Amblyrhynchus_ may be compared in some respects with the Trachodons\r\nnotwithstanding the difference in size. These modern saurians live in\r\ngreat numbers on the shores of the Galapagos Islands off the coast of\r\nChile. They swim out to sea in shoals and feed exclusively on seaweed\r\nwhich grows on the bottom at some distance from shore. The animal\r\nswims with perfect ease and quickness by a serpentine movement of its\r\nbody and flattened tail, its legs meanwhile being closely pressed to\r\nits side and motionless. This is also the method of propulsion of\r\ncrocodiles when swimming.\r\n\r\n\"The carnivorous or flesh-eating dinosaurs that lived on land, such as\r\n_Allosaurus_ and _Tyrannosaurus_, were protected from foes by their\r\nsharp biting teeth, while the land-living herbivorous forms were\r\nprovided with defensive horns, as in _Triceratops_, sharp spines as\r\nin _Stegosaurus_ or were completely armored as in _Ankylosaurus_.\r\nTrachodon was not provided with horns, spines or plated armor, but it\r\nwas sufficiently protected from carnivorous land forms by being able\r\nto enter and remain in the water. Its skin was covered with small\r\nraised scales, pentagonal in form on the body and tail, where they\r\nwere largest, with smaller reticulations over the joints but never\r\noverlapping as in snakes or fishes. A Trachodon skeleton was recently\r\nfound with an impression of the skin surrounding the vertebrae which\r\nis so well preserved that it gives even the contour of the tail as is\r\nshown in the illustration (fig. 32).\r\n\r\n\"During the existence of the Trachodonts the climate of the northern\r\npart of North America was much warmer than it is at present, the plant\r\nremains indicating a climate for Wyoming and Montana similar to what\r\nnow prevails in Southern California. Palm leaves resembling the\r\npalmetto of Florida are frequently found in the same rocks with these\r\nskeletons. Here occur also such, at present, widely separated trees as\r\nthe gingko now native of China, and the Sequoia now native of the\r\nPacific Coast. Fruits and leaves of the fig tree are also common, but\r\nmost abundant among the plant remains are the Equisetae or horsetail\r\nrushes, some species of which possibly supplied the Trachodons with\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 29.--Restoration of the Duck-billed Dinosaur\r\n  Trachodon. This restoration, made by Mr. Knight under supervision\r\n  of Professor Osborn, embodies the latest evidence as to the\r\n  structure and characteristic poses of these animals, the character\r\n  of the skin and their probable habits and environment. _After\r\n  Osborn_]\r\n\r\n\"Impressions of the more common plants found in the rocks of this\r\nperiod with sections of the tree trunks showing the woody structure\r\nwill be [have been] introduced into the group as the ground on which\r\nthe skeletons stand. In the rivers and bayous of that remote period\r\nthere also lived many kinds of Unios or fresh-water clams, and other\r\nshells, the casts of which are frequently found with Trachodon bones.\r\nThe fossil trunk of a coniferous tree was found in Wyoming, which was\r\nfilled with groups of wood-living shells similar to the living Teredo.\r\nThese also will be introduced in the ground-work.\r\n\r\n\"The skeleton mounted in a feeding posture was one of the principal\r\nspecimens in the Cope Collection, which, through the generosity of the\r\nlate President Jesup, was purchased and given to the American Museum.\r\nIt was found near the Moreau River, north of the Black Hills, South\r\nDakota, in 1882, by Dr. J.L. Wortman and Mr. R.S. Hill, collectors for\r\nProfessor Cope. The erect skeleton came from Crooked Creek, central\r\nMontana, and was found by a ranchman, Mr. Oscar Hunter, while riding\r\nthrough the bad lands with a companion in 1904. The specimen was\r\npartly exposed, with backbone and ribs united in position. The parts\r\nthat were weathered out are much lighter in color than the other\r\nbones. Their large size caused some discussion between the ranchmen\r\nand to settle the question, Mr. Hunter dismounted and kicked off all\r\nthe tops of the vertebrae and rib-heads above ground, thereby proving\r\nby their brittle nature that they were stone and not buffalo bones as\r\nthe other man contended. The proof was certainly conclusive, but it\r\nwas extremely exasperating to the subsequent collectors. Another\r\nranchman, Mr. Alfred Sensiba, heard of the find and knowing that it\r\nwas valuable 'traded' Mr. Hunter a six-shooter for his interest in it.\r\nThe specimen was purchased from Messrs. Sensiba Brothers and excavated\r\nby the American Museum in 1906.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 30.--THE DINOSAUR MUMMY. SKELETON OF A\r\n  TRACHODON PRESERVING THE SKIN IMPRESSIONS OVER A LARGE PART OF THE\r\n  BODY. _After Osborn_]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DINOSAUR \"MUMMY.\"\r\n\r\nWe all _believe_ that the Dinosaurs existed. But to realize it is not\r\nso easy. Even with the help of the mounted skeletons and restorations,\r\nthey are somewhat unreal and shadowy beings in the minds of most of\r\nus. But this \"dinosaur mummy\" sprawling on his back and covered with\r\nshrunken skin--a real specimen, not restored in any part--brings home\r\nthe reality of this ancient world even as the mummy of an ancient\r\nEgyptian brings home to us the reality of the world of the Pharaohs.\r\nThe description of this unique skeleton by Professor Henry Fairfield\r\nOsborn first appeared in the Museum Journal for January 1911.[17]\r\n\r\n\"Two years ago (1908) through the Jesup Fund, the Museum came into\r\npossession of a most unique specimen discovered in August 1908, by the\r\nveteran fossil hunter Charles H. Sternberg of Kansas. It is a large\r\nherbivorous dinosaur of the closing period of the Age of Reptiles and\r\nis known to palaeontologists as _Trachodon_ or more popularly as the\r\n'duck-billed dinosaur.'\r\n\r\n\"The skeleton or hard parts of these very remarkable animals had been\r\nknown for over forty years, and a few specimens of the epidermal\r\ncovering, but it was not until the discovery of the Sternberg specimen\r\nthat a complete knowledge of the outer covering of these dinosaurs was\r\ngained. It appears probable that in a number of cases these priceless\r\nskin impressions were mostly destroyed in removing the fossil\r\nspecimens from their surroundings because the explorers were not\r\nexpecting to find anything of the kind. Altogether seven specimens\r\nhave been discovered in which these delicate skin impressions were\r\npartly preserved, but the 'Trachodon mummy' far surpasses all the\r\nothers, as it yields a nearly complete picture of the outer covering.\r\n\r\n\"The reason the Sternberg specimen (_Trachodon annectens_) may be\r\nknown as a dinosaur 'mummy' is that in all the parts of the animal\r\nwhich are preserved (_i.e._ all except the hind limbs and the tail),\r\nthe epidermis is shrunken around the limbs, tightly drawn along the\r\nbony surfaces, and contracted like a great curtain below the chest\r\narea. This condition of the epidermis suggests the following theory of\r\nthe deposition and preservation of this wonderful specimen, namely:\r\nthat after dying a natural death the animal was not attacked or preyed\r\nupon by its enemies, and the body lay exposed to the sun entirely\r\nundisturbed for a long time, perhaps upon a broad sand flat of a\r\nstream in the low-water stage; the muscles and viscera thus became\r\ncompletely dehydrated, or desiccated by the action of the sun, the\r\nepidermis shrank around the limbs, was tightly drawn down along all\r\nthe bony surfaces, and became hardened and leathery, on the abdominal\r\nsurfaces the epidermis was certainly drawn within the body cavity,\r\nwhile it was thrown into creases and folds along the sides of the body\r\nowing to the shrinkage of the tissues within. At the termination of a\r\npossible low-water season during which these processes of desiccation\r\ntook place, the 'mummy' may have been caught in a sudden flood,\r\ncarried down the stream and rapidly buried in a bed of fine river sand\r\nintermingled with sufficient elements of clay to take a perfect cast\r\nor mold of all the epidermal markings before any of the epidermal\r\ntissues had time to soften under the solvent action of the water. In\r\nthis way the markings were indicated with absolute distinctness, ...\r\nthe visitor will be able by the use of the hand glass to study even\r\nthe finer details of the pattern, although of course there is no trace\r\neither of the epidermis itself, which has entirely disappeared, or of\r\nthe pigmentation or coloring, if such existed.\r\n\r\n\"Although attaining a height of fifteen to sixteen feet the trachodons\r\nwere not covered with scales or a bony protecting armature, but with\r\ndermal tubercles of relatively small size, which varied in shape and\r\narrangement in different species, and not improbably associated with\r\nthis varied epidermal pattern there was a varied color pattern. The\r\ntheory of a color pattern is based chiefly upon the fact that the\r\nlarger tubercles concentrate and become more numerous on all those\r\nportions of the body exposed to the sun, that is, on the outer\r\nsurfaces of the fore and hind limbs, and appear to increase also along\r\nthe sides of the body and to be more concentrated on the back. On the\r\nless exposed areas, the under side of the body and the inner sides of\r\nthe limbs, the smaller tubercles are more numerous, the larger\r\ntubercles being reduced to small irregularly arranged patches. From\r\nanalogy with existing lizards and snakes we may suppose, therefore,\r\nthat the trachodons presented a darker appearance when seen from the\r\nback and a lighter appearance when seen from the front.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 31.--The Dinosaur Mummy. Detail of skin of\r\n  under side of body. _After Osborn_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 32.--Skin impression from the tail of a\r\n  _Trachodon_. The impressions appear to have been left by horny\r\n  scutes or scales, not overlapping like the scales on the body of\r\n  most modern reptiles, but more like the scutes on the head of a\r\n  lizard.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 33.--Skull of Gila Monster (_Heloderma_), for\r\n  comparison of surface with skin impressions of _Trachodon_.\r\n  Enlarged to 4/3.]\r\n\r\n\"The thin character of the epidermis as revealed by this specimen\r\nfavors also the theory that these animals spent a large part of their\r\ntime in the water, which theory is strengthened by the fact that the\r\ndiminutive fore limb terminates not in claws or hoofs, but in a broad\r\nextension of the skin, reaching beyond the fingers and forming a kind\r\nof paddle.[18] The marginal web which connects all the fingers with\r\neach other, together with the fact that the lower side of the fore\r\nlimb is as delicate in its epidermal structure as the upper,\r\ncertainly tends to support the theory of the swimming rather than the\r\nwalking or terrestrial function of this fore paddle as indicated in\r\nthe accompanying preliminary restoration that was made by Charles R.\r\nKnight working under the writer's direction. One is drawn in the\r\nconventional bipedal or standing posture while the other is in a\r\nquadrupedal pose or walking position, sustaining or balancing the fore\r\npart of the body on a muddy surface with its fore feet. In the distant\r\nwater a large number of animals are disporting themselves.\r\n\r\n\"The designation of these animals as the 'duck-billed' dinosaurs in\r\nreference to the broadening of the beak, has long been considered in\r\nconnection with the theory of aquatic habitat. The conversion of the\r\nfore limb into a sort of paddle, as evidenced by the Sternberg\r\nspecimen, strengthens this theory.\r\n\r\n\"This truly wonderful specimen, therefore, nearly doubles our previous\r\ninsight into the habits and life of a very remarkable group of\r\nreptiles.\"\r\n\r\n_Saurolophus, Corythosaurus._ In the latest Cretaceous formation, the\r\nLance or Triceratops beds, all the duck-billed dinosaurs are much\r\nalike, and are referred to the single genus _Trachodon_. In somewhat\r\nolder formations of the Cretacic period there were several different\r\nkinds. _Saurolophus_ has a high bony spine rising from the top of the\r\nskull; in _Corythosaurus_ there is a thin high crest like the crown of\r\na cassowary on top of the skull, and the muzzle is short and small\r\ngiving a very peculiar aspect to the head. Complete skeletons of these\r\ntwo genera are exhibited in the Dinosaur Hall; the _Corythosaurus_ is\r\nworthy of careful study, as the skin of the body, hind limbs and tail,\r\nthe ossified tendons, and even the impressions of the muscular tissues\r\nin parts of the body and tail, are more or less clearly indicated.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 34.--SKELETON OF SAUROLOPHUS, FROM UPPER\r\n  CRETACIC OF ALBERTA. _After Brown_]\r\n\r\nThese Duck-billed Dinosaurs probably ranged all over North America and\r\nthe northerly portions of the Old World during the later Cretacic.\r\nFragmentary remains have been found in New Jersey and southward along\r\nthe Atlantic coast. A partial skeleton was described many years ago by\r\nLeidy under the name of _Hadrosaurus_ and restored and mounted in the\r\nmuseum of the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences. _Telmatosaurus_ of the\r\nGosau formation in Austria also belongs to this group, and fragmentary\r\nremains have been found in the upper Cretacic of Belgium, England and\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Brown, Barnum. \"The Trachodon Group.\" Amer.

THE ARMORED DINOSAURS--STEGOSAURUS, ANKYLOSAURUS.\r\n\r\n_Sub-Order Stegosauria._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis group of dinosaurs is most remarkable for the massive bony armor\r\nplates, crests or spines covering the body and tail. They were more or\r\nless completely quadrupedal instead of bipedal, with straight\r\npost-like limbs and short rounded hoofed feet adapted to support the\r\nweight of the massive body and heavy armature. Although so different\r\nsuperficially from the bird-footed biped Iguanodonts they are\r\nevidently related to them, for the teeth are similar, and the horny\r\nbeak, the construction of the pelvis, the three-toed hind foot and\r\nfour-toed front foot all betray relationship. From what we know of\r\nthem it seems probable that they evolved from Iguanodont ancestors,\r\ndeveloping the bony armor as a protection against the attacks of\r\ncarnivorous dinosaurs, and modifying the proportions of limbs and feet\r\nto enable them to support its weight. They were evidently herbivorous\r\nand some of them of gigantic size. Smaller kinds with less massive\r\narmor have been found in Europe but the largest and most extraordinary\r\nmembers of this strange race are from North America.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEGOSAURUS.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary reptile equalled the Allosaurus in size, and bore\r\nalong the crest of the back a double row of enormous bony plates\r\nprojecting upward and somewhat outward alternately to one side and the\r\nother. The largest of these plates situated just back of the pelvis\r\nwere over two feet high, two and a half long, thinning out from a base\r\nfour inches thick. The tail was armed with four or more stout spines\r\ntwo feet long and five or six inches thick at the base. In the neck\r\nregion and probably elsewhere the skin had numerous small bony nodules\r\nand some larger ones imbedded in its substance or protecting its\r\nsurface. The head was absurdly small for so huge an animal, and the\r\nstiff thick tail projected backward but was not long enough to reach\r\nthe ground. The hind limbs are very long and straight, the fore limbs\r\nrelatively short, and the short high arched back and extremely deep\r\nand compressed body served to exaggerate the height and prominence of\r\nthe great plates. The surface of these plates, covered with a network\r\nof blood-vessels, shows that they bore a covering of thick horny skin\r\nduring life, which probably projected as a ridge beyond their edges\r\nand still further increased their size. The spines of the tail, also,\r\nwere probably cased in horn.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary animal was a contemporary of the Brontosaurus and\r\nAllosaurus, and its discovery was one of the great achievements of the\r\nlate Professor Marsh. The skeletons which he described are mounted in\r\nthe Yale and National Museums. Another skeleton was found in the\r\nfamous Bone-Cabin Quarry, near Medicine Bow, Wyoming, by the American\r\nMuseum Expedition of 1901. This skeleton, at present withdrawn from\r\nlack of space, will be mounted in the Jurassic Dinosaur Hall in the\r\nnew wing now under construction.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 35.--Skull and lower jaw of Armored Dinosaur\r\n  _Ankylosaurus_, from Upper Cretacic (Edmonton formation) of\r\n  Alberta. Left side view. _After Brown_]\r\n\r\n\r\nANKYLOSAURUS.\r\n\r\nRelated to _Stegosaurus_, equally huge, but very different in\r\nproportions and character of its armor was the Ankylosaurus of the\r\nlate Cretacic. This animal, a contemporary of the Tyrannosaurus and\r\nduck-billed dinosaurs was more effectively though less grotesquely\r\narmored than its more ancient relative. The body is covered with\r\nmassive bony plates set close together and lying flat over the surface\r\nfrom head to tip of tail. While the stegosaur's body was narrow and\r\ncompressed, in this animal it is exceptionally broad and the wide\r\nspreading ribs are coössified with the vertebrae, making a very solid\r\nsupport for the transverse rows of armor plates. The head is broad\r\ntriangular, flat topped and solidly armored, the plates consolidated\r\nwith the surface of the skull and overhanging sides and front, the\r\nnostrils and eyes overhung by plates and bosses of bone; and the tail\r\nended in a blunt heavy club of massive plates consolidated to each\r\nother and to the tip of the tail vertebrae. The legs were short,\r\nmassive and straight, ending probably in elephant-like feet. The\r\nanimal has well been called \"the most ponderous animated citadel the\r\nworld has ever seen\" and we may suppose that when it tucked in its\r\nlegs and settled down on the surface it would be proof even against\r\nthe attacks of the terrible Tyrannosaur.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 36.--_Ankylosaurus_, top view of skull in fig.\r\n  35. _After Brown_]\r\n\r\nThis marvellous animal was made known to science by the discoveries of\r\nthe Museum parties in Montana and Alberta under Barnum Brown.\r\nFragmentary remains of smaller relatives had been discovered by\r\nearlier explorers but nothing that gave any adequate notion of its\r\ncharacter or gigantic size. From a partial skeleton discovered in the\r\nHell Creek beds of Montana, and others in the Edmonton and Belly River\r\nformations of the Red Deer River, Alberta, it has been possible to\r\nreconstruct the entire skeleton of the animal, save for the feet, and\r\nto locate and arrange most of the armor plates exactly. A skeleton\r\nmount from these specimens will shortly be constructed for the\r\nCretaceous Dinosaur Hall.\r\n\r\n_Scelidosaurus, Polacanthus, etc._ Various armored dinosaurs, of\r\nsmaller size and less heavily plated, have been described from the\r\nJurassic, Comanchic and Cretacic formations of Europe. The best known\r\nare _Scelidosaurus_ of the Lower Jurassic of England, and\r\n_Polacanthus_ of the Comanchic (Wealden). _Stegopelta_ of the\r\nCretaceous of Wyoming is more nearly related to _Ankylosaurus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE BEAKED DINOSAURS (Concluded.)\r\n\r\nD. THE HORNED DINOSAURS, TRICERATOPS, ETC.\r\n\r\n_Sub-Order Ceratopsia._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1887 Professor Marsh published a brief notice of what he supposed\r\nto be a fossil bison horn found near Denver, Colorado. Two years later\r\nthe explorations of the lamented John B. Hatcher in Wyoming and\r\nMontana resulted in the unexpected discovery that this horn belonged\r\nnot to a bison but to a gigantic horned reptile, and that it belonged\r\nnot in the geological yesterday as at first thought, but in the far\r\nback Cretacic, millions of years ago. For Mr. Hatcher found complete\r\nskulls, and later secured skeletons, clearly of the Dinosaurian group,\r\nbut representing a race of dinosaurs whose existence, or at least\r\ntheir extraordinary character, had been quite unsuspected. It appeared\r\nindeed that certain teeth and skeleton bones previously discovered by\r\nProfessor Cope were related to this new type of dinosaur, but the\r\nfragments known to the Philadelphia professor gave him no idea of what\r\nthe animal was like, although with his usual acumen he had discerned\r\nthat they differed from any animal known to science and registered\r\nthem as new under the names of _Agathaumas_ 1873 and _Monoclonius_\r\n1876. Professor Marsh re-named his supposed bison \"_Ceratops_\" (_i.e._\r\n\"horned face\") and gave to the closely related skulls discovered by\r\nMr. Hatcher the name of _Triceratops_ (_i.e._ \"three horned face\"),\r\nwhile to the whole group he gave the name of Ceratopsia.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 37.--Skulls of Horned Dinosaurs. The lower\r\n  row, _Ceratops_, _Styracosaurus_, _Monoclonius_, are from the\r\n  Middle Cretacic (Belly River formation) of Alberta;\r\n  _Anchiceratops_ is from the Upper Cretacic (Edmonton formation) of\r\n  Alberta; _Triceratops_ and _Torosaurus_ from the uppermost\r\n  Cretacic (Lance formation) of Wyoming.]\r\n\r\nThese were the first of a long series of discoveries which through\r\nscientific and popular descriptions have made the Horned Dinosaurs\r\nfamiliar to the world. Most of them are still very imperfectly known,\r\nand of their evolution and earlier history we know very little as yet.\r\nBut we can form a fairly correct idea of their general appearance and\r\nhabits and of the part they played in the world of the late Cretacic.\r\nSo far as known they were limited to North America. The most striking\r\nfeature of the Horned Dinosaurs is the gigantic skull, armed with a\r\npair of horns over the orbits and a median horn on the nasal bones in\r\nfront, and with a great bony crest projecting at the back and sides.\r\nIn some species the skull with its bony frill attains a length of\r\nseven or even eight feet and about three feet width; the usual length\r\nis five or six feet and the width about three. In the best known\r\ngenus, _Triceratops_, the paired horns are long and stout and the\r\nfront horn quite short or almost absent, while in _Monoclonius_ these\r\nproportions are reversed, the front horn being long while the paired\r\nhorns are rudimentary.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are in a single row but are broadened out into a wide\r\ngrinding surface. The animal was quadrupedal, with short massive limbs\r\nand rounded elephantine feet tipped with hoofs, three in the hind\r\nfoot, four in the fore foot, a short massive tail that could hardly\r\nreach the ground, a short broad-barrelled body and a short neck\r\ncompletely hidden on top and sides by the overhanging bony frill of\r\nthe skull. In many respects these animals are suggestive far more than\r\nany other dinosaurs, of the great quadrupeds of Tertiary and modern\r\ntimes, rhinoceroses, hippopotami, titanotheres and elephants, as in\r\nthe horns they suggest the bison. For this reason although less\r\ngigantic than the Brontosaurus or Tyrannosaurus, less grotesque\r\nperhaps, than the Stegosaurus, they are more interesting than any\r\nother dinosaurs. While thus departing far from the earlier type of the\r\nbeaked dinosaurs (the Iguanodonts) they are evidently descended from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 38.--Skull of _Triceratops_ from the Lance\r\n  formation in Wyoming, one-eighteenth natural size. The length of\r\n  the horns is 2 feet, 9-1/2 inches. The rostral bone or beak, and\r\n  the lower jaw, are lacking; in the illustration on the cover they\r\n  have been restored in outline. This fine skull was discovered by\r\n  George M. Sternberg, and purchased for the Museum by Mr. Charles\r\n  Lanier in 1909.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRICERATOPS.\r\n\r\nThis is the best known of the Horned Dinosaurs, as various skulls and\r\npartial skeletons have been found from which it has been possible to\r\nreconstruct the entire animal. There is a mounted skeleton in the\r\nNational Museum, another will shortly be mounted in the American\r\nMuseum, and there are skulls in several American and European\r\nmuseums.\r\n\r\n_Triceratops_ exceeded the largest rhinoceroses in bulk, equalling a\r\nfairly large elephant, but with much shorter legs. The great horns\r\nover the eyes projected forward or partly upward; in one of our skulls\r\nthey are 33-1/2 inches long. During life they were probably covered\r\nwith horn increasing the length by six inches or perhaps a foot. The\r\nball-like condyle for articulation of the neck lies far underneath, at\r\nthe base of the frill, almost in the middle of the skull.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 39.--Skull of _Monoclonius_, a horned dinosaur\r\n  from the Cretacic (Belly River formation) of Alberta.\r\n  One-fifteenth natural size. The horns over the eyes are\r\n  rudimentary, and the nasal horn large, reversing the proportions\r\n  in _Triceratops_.]\r\n\r\n_Monoclonius, Ceratops, etc._ The _Triceratops_ and another equally\r\ngigantic Horned Dinosaur, _Torosaurus_, were the last survivors of\r\ntheir race. In somewhat older formations of Cretacic age are found\r\nremains of smaller kinds, some of them ancestors of these latest\r\nsurvivors, others collaterally related. None of these have the bony\r\nfrill completely roofing over the neck as it does in _Triceratops_.\r\nThere is always a central spine projecting backwards and widening out\r\nat the top to the bony margin of the frill which sweeps around on each\r\nside to join bony plates that project from the sides of the skull top.\r\nThis encloses an open space or \"fenestra,\" so that the neck was not\r\ncompletely protected above. Sometimes the margin of the frill is\r\nplain, at other times it carries a number of great spikes, like a\r\ngigantic Horned Lizard (_Phrynosoma_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 40.--Outline sketch restoration of\r\n  _Triceratops_, from the mounted skeleton in the National Museum.]\r\n\r\nIn _Ceratops_ the horns over the eyes are large and the nasal horn\r\nsmall. In _Monoclonius_ the nasal horn is large and those over the\r\neyes are rudimentary. The great variety of species that has been found\r\nin recent years shows that these Horned Dinosaurs were a numerous and\r\nvaried race of which as yet we know only a few. Of their evolution we\r\nhave little direct knowledge, but probably they are descended from the\r\nIguanodonts and Camptosaurs of the Comanchic, and their quadrupedal\r\ngait, huge heads, short tails and other peculiarities are secondary\r\nspecializations, their ancestors being bipedal, long-tailed, small\r\nheaded and hornless.\r\n\r\nThe fine skulls of _Triceratops_, _Monoclonius_, _Ceratops_ and\r\n_Anchiceratops_ in the Museum collections illustrate the variety of\r\nthese remarkable animals. Complete skeletons of the first two genera\r\nare being prepared for mounting and exhibition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF DINOSAURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemains of Dinosaurs have been found in all the continents, but\r\nchiefly in Europe and North America. Explorations in other parts of\r\nthe world have not as yet been sufficient to show whether or not each\r\ncontinent developed especial kinds peculiar to it, nor to afford any\r\nreliable evidence as to whether the relations of the continents were\r\ndifferent during the Mesozoic. Thus far, the Carnivorous group seems\r\nmost widespread, for it alone has been found in Australia. The\r\nSauropods or Amphibious Dinosaurs have been found in Europe, North\r\nAmerica, India, Madagascar, Patagonia, and Africa, sufficient to show\r\nthat their distribution was world wide with the possible exception of\r\nAustralia, and probable exception of most oceanic islands (few of the\r\nmodern oceanic islands existed at that time although there may well\r\nhave been many others no longer extant). The Beaked Dinosaurs are more\r\nlimited in their distribution, for none of them so far as at present\r\nknown reached Australia or South America. But in the present stage of\r\ndiscovery it would be rash to conclude that they were surely limited\r\nto the regions where they have been discovered. It is not wholly\r\nclear as yet whether the Dinosaurian fauna that flourished at the end\r\nof the Jurassic in the north survived to the Upper Cretacic in the\r\nsouthern continents, but present evidence points that way, and\r\nindicates that the girdle of ocean which during the Cretacic\r\ndepression encircled the northern world, formed a barrier which the\r\nCretacic dinosaurian fauna never succeeded in crossing.\r\n\r\nThe earlier groups of Beaked Dinosaurs are found in both Europe and\r\nAmerica, and in the Cretacic the Duck-billed and Armored groups are\r\nrepresented in both regions. The Horned Dinosaurs, however, are known\r\nwith certainty only from North America.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the important fossil specimens in this country have been\r\nfound in the West, more fragmentary remains have been found on the\r\nAtlantic sea-board, and it is probable that they ranged all over the\r\nintervening region, wherever they found an environment suited to their\r\nparticular needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTING DINOSAURS.\r\n\r\nHOW AND WHERE THEY ARE FOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visitor who is introduced to the dinosaurs through the medium of\r\nbooks and pictures or of the skeletons exhibited in the great museums,\r\nfinds it hard--well nigh impossible--to realize their existence.\r\nHowever willing he may be to accept on faith the reconstructions of\r\nthe skeletons, the restorations of the animals and their supposed\r\nenvironment, it yet remains to him somewhat of a fairy-tale, a\r\nfanciful imaginative world peopled with ogres and dragons and\r\nbelonging to the unreal \"once upon a time\" which has no connection\r\nwith the ever present workaday world in which we live. Birds and\r\nsquirrels, rabbits and foxes belong to this real world because he has\r\nseen them in his walks through the woods; even elephants and\r\nrhinoceroses, though his acquaintance be limited to menagerie\r\nspecimens, seem fairly real--although one recalls the farmer's comment\r\non first seeing a giraffe in the Zoological park: \"There aint no sich\r\nanimal.\" But dinosaurs--one easily realizes the state of mind that\r\nprompts the inquiry so often made by visitors to the Dinosaur\r\nHall:--\"they make these out of plaster, don't they?\" So far as is\r\nconsistent with good taste, the aim of the American Museum has been\r\nto enable the visitor to see for himself how much of plaster\r\nreconstruction there is to each skeleton, and to explain in the labels\r\nwhat the basis was for the reconstructed parts.\r\n\r\n_How They are Found._ But to the collector these extinct animals are\r\nreal enough. As he journeys over the western plains he sees the\r\nvarious living inhabitants thereof, birds and beasts, as well as men,\r\npursuing their various modes of life; here and there he comes across\r\nthe scattered skeletons or bones of modern animals lying strewn upon\r\nthe surface of the ground or half buried in the soil of a cut bank. In\r\nthe shales or sandstones that underlie the soil he finds the objects\r\nof his search, skeletons or bones of extinct animals, similarly\r\ndisposed, but buried in rock instead of soft soil, and exposed in\r\ncañons and gullies cut through the solid rock. Each rock formation, he\r\nknows by precept and experience, carries its own peculiar fauna, its\r\nanimals are different from those of the formation above and from those\r\nin the formation below. Days and weeks he may spend in fruitless\r\nsearch following along the outcrop of the formation, through rugged\r\nbadlands, along steep cañon walls, around isolated points or buttes,\r\nwithout finding more than a few fragments, but spurred on by vivid\r\ninterest and the rainbow prospect of some new or rare find. Finally\r\nperhaps, after innumerable disappointments, a trail of fragments leads\r\nup to a really promising prospect. A cautious investigation indicates\r\nthat an articulated skeleton is buried at this point, and that not\r\ntoo much of it has \"gone out\" and rolled in weathered fragments down\r\nthe slope. For the tedious and delicate process of disinterring the\r\nskeleton from the rock he will need to keep ever in mind the form and\r\nrelations of each bone, the picture of the skeleton as it may have\r\nbeen when buried. The heavy ledges above are removed with pick and\r\nshovel, often with help of dynamite and a team and scraper. As he gets\r\nnearer to the stratum in which the bones lie the work must be more and\r\nmore careful. A false blow with pick or chisel might destroy\r\nirreparably some important bony structure. Bit by bit he traces out\r\nthe position and lay of the bones, working now mostly with awl and\r\nwhisk-broom, uncovering the more massive portions, blocking out the\r\ndelicate bones in the rock, soaking the exposed surfaces repeatedly\r\nwith thin \"gum\" (mucilage) or shellac, channeling around and between\r\nthe bones until they stand out on little pedestals above the quarry\r\nfloor. Then, after the gum or shellac has dried thoroughly and\r\nhardened the soft parts, and the surfaces of bone exposed are further\r\nprotected by pasting on a layer of tissue paper, it is ready for the\r\n\"plaster jacket.\" This consists of strips of burlap dipped in\r\nplaster-of-paris and pasted over the surface of each block until top\r\nand sides, all but the pedestal on which it rests, are completely\r\ncased in, the strips being pressed and kneaded close to the surface of\r\nthe block as they are laid on. When this jacket sets and dries the\r\nblock is rigid and stiff enough to lift and turn over; the remains of\r\nthe pedestal are trimmed off and the under surface is plastered like\r\nthe rest. With large blocks it is often necessary to paste into the\r\njacket, on upper or both sides, boards, scantling or sticks of wood to\r\nsecure additional rigidity. For should the block \"rack,\" or become\r\nshattered inside, even though no fragments were lost, the specimen\r\nwould be more or less completely ruined.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 41.--A Dinosaur skeleton, prospected and ready\r\n  for encasing in plaster bandages and removal in blocks.\r\n  (_Corythosaurus_, Red Deer River, Alberta.)]\r\n\r\nThe next stage will be packing in boxes with straw, hay or other\r\nmaterials, hauling to the railway and shipment to New York.\r\n\r\nArrived at the Museum, the boxes are unpacked, each block laid out on\r\na table, the upper side of its plaster jacket softened with water and\r\ncut away, and the preparation of the bone begins. Always it is more or\r\nless cracked and broken up, but the fragments lie in their natural\r\nrelations. Each piece must be lifted out, thoroughly cleaned from rock\r\nand dirt, and the fractured surfaces cemented together again. Parts of\r\nbones, especially the interior, are often rotted into dust while the\r\nharder outer surface is still preserved. The dust must be scraped out,\r\nthe interior filled with a plaster cement, and the surface pieces\r\nre-set in position. Very often a steel rod is set into the plaster\r\nfilling the interior of a bone, to secure additional strength.\r\n\r\nAfter this preparation is completed, each part being soaked repeatedly\r\nwith shellac until it will absorb no more, the bones can be handled\r\nand laid out for study or exhibition. Then, if they are to be mounted\r\nfor a fossil skeleton, comes the work of restoring the missing parts.\r\nFor this a plaster composition is used.\r\n\r\nWhere only parts of one side are missing the corresponding parts of\r\nthe other side are used for model; where both sides are missing, other\r\nindividuals or nearly related species may serve as a guide. But it is\r\nseldom wise to attempt restoration of a skeleton unless at least\r\ntwo-thirds of it is present; composite skeletons made up of the\r\nremains of several or many individuals, have been attempted, but they\r\nare dangerous experiments in animals so imperfectly known as are most\r\nof the dinosaurs. There is too much risk of including bones that\r\npertain to other species or genera, and of introducing thereby into\r\nthe restoration a more or less erroneous concept of the animal which\r\nit represents. The same criticism applies to an overly large amount of\r\nplaster restoration.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 42.--Bone-Cabin Draw on Little Medicine River\r\n  north of Medicine Bow, Wyoming. The location of the quarry is\r\n  indicated by the stack of crated specimens on the left, and close\r\n  to it the low sod-covered shack where the collecting party lived.\r\n  Beyond the draw lies the flat rolling surface of the Laramie\r\n  Plains and on the southern horizon the Medicine Bow Range with Elk\r\n  Mountain at the center.]\r\n\r\nIn some instances the missing parts of a skeleton are not restored,\r\nbecause, even though but a small part be gone, we have no good\r\nevidence to guide in its reconstruction. This gives an imperfect and\r\nsometimes misleading concept of what the whole skeleton was like, but\r\nit is better than restoring it erroneously. Usually with the more\r\nimperfect skeletons, a skull, a limb or some other characteristic\r\nparts may be placed on exhibition but the remainder of the specimen is\r\nstored in the study collections.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 43.--American Museum party at Bone-Cabin\r\n  Quarry, 1899.

Lull,\r\n  Albert Thomson, Peter Kaison.]\r\n\r\n_Where They are Found._ The chief dinosaur localities in this country\r\nare along the flanks of the Rocky Mountains and the plains to the\r\neastward, from Canada to Texas. Not that dinosaurs were any more\r\nabundant there than elsewhere. They probably ranged all over North\r\nAmerica, and different kinds inhabited other continents as well. But\r\nin the East and the Middle West, the conditions were not favorable for\r\npreserving their remains, except in a few localities. Formations of\r\nthis age are less extensive, especially those of the delta and\r\ncoast-swamps which the dinosaurs frequented. And where they do occur,\r\nthey are largely covered by vegetation and cannot be explored to\r\nadvantage. In the arid Western regions these formations girdle the\r\nRockies and outlying mountain chains for two-thousand miles from north\r\nto south, and are extensively exposed in great escarpments, river\r\ncañons and \"badland\" areas, bare of soil and vegetation and affording\r\nan immense stretch of exposed rock for the explorer. Much of this area\r\nindeed is desert, too far away from water to be profitably searched\r\nunder present conditions, or too far away from railroads to allow of\r\ntransportation of the finds at a reasonable expense. Fossils are much\r\nmore common in certain parts of the region, and these localities have\r\nmostly been explored more or less thoroughly. But the field is far\r\nfrom being exhausted. New localities have been found and old\r\nlocalities re-explored in recent years, yielding specimens equal to or\r\nbetter than any heretofore discovered. And as the railroad and the\r\nautomobile render new regions accessible, and the erosion of the\r\nformations by wind and rain brings new specimens to the surface, we\r\nmay look forward to new discoveries for many years to come.\r\n\r\nIn other continents, except in Europe, there has been but little\r\nexploration for dinosaurs. Enough is known to assure us that they will\r\nyield faunæ no less extensive and remarkable than our own. We are in\r\nfact only beginning to appreciate the vast extent and variety of these\r\nrecords of a past world.\r\n\r\nIn a preceding chapter it was shown that the chief formations in which\r\ndinosaur remains have been found belong to the end of the Jurassic and\r\nthe end of the Cretacic periods. The Jurassic dinosaur formations\r\nskirt the Rockies and outlying mountain ranges but are often turned up\r\non edge and poorly exposed, or barren of fossils. The richest\r\ncollecting ground is in the Laramie Plains, between the Rockies and\r\nthe Laramie range in south-central Wyoming, but important finds have\r\nalso been made in Colorado and Utah. The Cretaceous Dinosaur\r\nformations extend somewhat further out on the plains to the eastward,\r\nand the best collecting regions thus far explored are in eastern\r\nWyoming, central Montana and in Alberta, Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST DISCOVERY OF DINOSAURS IN THE WEST.\r\n\r\n_By Prof. S.W. Williston._\r\n\r\nMost great discoveries are due rather to a state of mind, if I may use\r\nsuch an expression, than to accident. The discovery of the immense\r\ndinosaur deposits in the Rocky Mountains in March, 1877, may\r\ntruthfully be called great, for nothing in paleontology has equalled\r\nit, and that it was made by three observers simultaneously can not be\r\ncalled purely an accident. These discoverers were Mr. O. Lucas, then\r\na school teacher, later clergyman; Professor Arthur Lakes, then a\r\nteacher in the School of Mines at Golden, Colorado; and Mr. William\r\nReed, then a section foreman of the Union Pacific Railroad at Como,\r\nWyoming, later the curator of paleontology of the University of\r\nWyoming--even as I write this, comes the notice of his death,--the\r\nlast. I knew them all, and the last two were long intimate friends.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1878 I wrote the following:[19]\r\n\r\n\"The history of their discovery (the dinosaurs) is both interesting\r\nand remarkable. For years the beds containing them had been studied by\r\ngeologists of experience, under the surveys of Hayden and King, but,\r\nwith the possible exception of the half of a caudal vertebra, obtained\r\nby Hayden and described by Leidy as a species of _Poikilopleuron_, not\r\na single fragment had been recognized. This is all the more remarkable\r\nfrom the fact that in several of the localities I have observed acres\r\nliterally strewn with fragments of bones, many of them extremely\r\ncharacteristic and so large as to have taxed the strength of a strong\r\nman to lift them. Three of the localities known to me are in the\r\nimmediate vicinity, if not upon the actual townsites of thriving\r\nvillages, and for years numerous fragments have been collected by (or\r\nfor) tourists and exhibited as fossil wood. The quantities hitherto\r\nobtained, though apparently so vast, are wholly unimportant in\r\ncomparison with those awaiting the researches of geologists throughout\r\nthe Rocky Mountain region. I doubt not that many hundreds of tons will\r\neventually be exhumed.\" Rather a startling prophecy to make within\r\neighteen months of their discovery, but it was hardly exaggerated.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say which of these three observers actually made\r\nthe first discovery of Jurassic dinosaurs; whatever doubt there is is\r\nin favor of Mr. Reed.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lakes, accompanied by his friend Mr. E.L. Beckwith, an\r\nengineer, was, one day in March, 1877, hunting along the \"hogback\" in\r\nthe vicinity of Morrison, Colorado, for fossil leaves in the Dakota\r\nCretaceous sandstone which caps the ridge, when he saw a large block\r\nof sandstone with an enormous vertebra partly imbedded in it. He\r\ndiscussed the nature of the fossil with his friend (so he told me) and\r\nfinally concluded that it was a fossil bone. He had recently come from\r\nEngland and had heard of Professor Phillips' discoveries of similar\r\ndinosaurs there. He knew of Professor Marsh of Yale from his recent\r\ndiscoveries of toothed birds in the chalk of Kansas, and reported the\r\nfind to him. As a result, the specimen, rock and all, was shipped to\r\nhim by express at ten cents a pound! And Professor Marsh immediately\r\nannounced the discovery of _Titanosaurus_ (_Atlantosaurus_) _immanis_,\r\na huge dinosaur having a probable length of one hundred and fifteen\r\nfeet and unknown height. And Professor Lakes was immediately set at\r\nwork in the \"Morrison quarry\" near by, whence comes the accepted name\r\nof these dinosaur beds in the Rocky Mountains. Professor Lakes once\r\nshowed me the exact spot where he found his first specimen.\r\n\r\nMr. Lucas, teaching his first term of a country school that spring in\r\nGarden Park near Cañon City, as an amateur botanist was interested in\r\nthe plants of the vicinity. Rambling through the adjacent hills in\r\nsearch of them, in March, 1877, he stumbled upon some fragments of\r\nfossil bones in a little ravine not far from the famous quarry later\r\nworked for Professor Marsh. He recognized them as fossils and they\r\ngreatly excited, not only his curiosity, but the curiosity of the\r\nneighbors. He had heard of the late Professor Cope and sent some of\r\nthe bones to him, who promptly labelled them _Camarasaurus supremus_.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of these discoveries promptly brought Mr. David\r\nBaldwin, Professor Marsh's collector in New Mexico, to the scene. Only\r\na few months previously he had discovered fossil bones in the red beds\r\nof New Mexico, the since famous Permian deposits. He naturally\r\nexplored the same beds at Cañon City, immediately below the dinosaur\r\ndeposits, and soon found the still very problematical _Hallopus_\r\nskeleton, at their very top, a specimen which after nearly forty years\r\nremains unique of its kind.\r\n\r\nA few years earlier Professor Marsh, on his way east from the Tertiary\r\ndeposits of western Wyoming, had stopped at Como, Wyoming, to observe\r\nthe strange salamanders, or \"fish with legs\" as they were widely\r\nknown, so abundant in the lake at that place, about whose\r\ntransformations he later wrote a paper, perhaps the only one on modern\r\nvertebrates that he ever published. While he was there Mr. Carlin, the\r\nstation agent, showed him some fossil bone fragments, so Mr. Reed told\r\nme, that they had picked up in the vicinity, and about which Professor\r\nMarsh made some comments. But he was so engrossed with the other\r\ndiscoveries he was then making that he did not follow up the\r\nsuggestion. Had he done so the discovery of the \"Jurassic Dinosaurs\"\r\nwould have been made five years earlier.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed, tramping over the famous Como hills after game--he had been\r\na professional hunter of game for the construction camps of the Union\r\nPacific Railroad--in the winter and spring of 1877, observed some\r\nfossil bones just south of the railway station that excited his\r\ncuriosity. But he and Mr. Carlin did not make their discovery known to\r\nProfessor Marsh till the following autumn, and then under assumed\r\nnames, fearing that they would be robbed of their discovery. I was\r\nsent to Como in November of 1877 from Cañon City. I got off the train\r\nat the station after midnight, and enquired for the nearest\r\nhotel--(the station comprised two houses only), and where I could find\r\nMessrs. Smith and Robinson. I was told that the section house was the\r\nonly hotel in the place and that these gentlemen lived in the country\r\nand that there was no regular bus-line yet running to their ranch. A\r\nfreshly opened box of cigars, however, helped clear up things, and I\r\njoined Mr. Reed the next day in opening \"Quarry No. 1\" of the Como\r\nhills. Inasmuch as the mercury in the thermometer during the next two\r\nmonths seldom reached zero--upward I mean--the opening of this famous\r\ndeposit was made under difficulties. That so much \"head cheese,\" as we\r\ncalled it, was shipped to Professor Marsh was more the fault of the\r\nweather and his importunities than our carelessness. However, we found\r\nsome of the types of dinosaurs that have since become famous.\r\n\r\nI joined Professor Lakes at the Morrison quarry in early September of\r\n1877, and helped dig out some of the bones of _Atlantosaurus_. A few\r\nweeks later I was sent to Cañon City to help Professor Mudge, my old\r\nteacher, and Mr. Felch, who had begun work there in the famous \"Marsh\r\nQuarry\". It was here that we found the type of _Diplodocus_.\r\n\r\nThe hind leg, pelvis and much of the tail of this specimen lay in very\r\norderly arrangement in the sandstone near the edge of the quarry, but\r\nthe bones were broken into innumerable pieces. After consultation we\r\ndecided that they were too much broken to be worth saving--and so most\r\nof them went over into the dump. Sacrilege, doubtless, the modern\r\ncollector will say, but we did not know much about the modern methods\r\nof collecting in those days, and moreover we were in too much of a\r\nhurry to get the new discoveries to Yale College to take much pains\r\nwith them. I did observe that the caudal vertebrae had very peculiar\r\nchevrons, unlike others that I had seen, and so I attempted to save\r\nsome samples of them by pasting them up with thick layers of paper.\r\nHad we only known of plaster-of-paris and burlap the whole specimen\r\nmight easily have been saved. Later, when I reached New Haven, I took\r\noff the paper and called Professor Marsh's attention to the strange\r\nchevrons. And _Diplodocus_ was the result.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 44.--The first dinosaur specimen found at\r\n  Bone-Cabin Quarry. Hind limb of _Diplodocus_.]\r\n\r\nMy own connection with the discoveries of these old dinosaurs\r\ncontinued only through the following summer, in Wyoming, when we added\r\nthe first mammals from the hills immediately back of the station, and\r\nthe types of some of the smaller dinosaurs, and when we explored the\r\nvicinity for other deposits, on Rock Creek and in the Freeze Out\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nHow many tons of these fossils have since been dug up from these\r\ndeposits in the Rocky Mountains is beyond computation. My prophecy of\r\nhundreds of tons has been fulfilled; and they are preserved in many\r\nmuseums of the world.\r\n\r\n                    S.W. WILLISTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DINOSAURS OF THE BONE-CABIN QUARRY.[20]\r\n\r\n_By Henry Fairfield Osborn._\r\n\r\nOne is often asked the questions: \"How do you find fossils?\" \"How do\r\nyou know where to look for them?\" One of the charms of the\r\nfossil-hunter's life is the variety, the element of certainty combined\r\nwith the gambling element of chance. Like the prospector for gold, the\r\nfossil-hunter may pass suddenly from the extreme of dejection to the\r\nextreme of elation. Luck comes in a great variety of ways: sometimes\r\nas the result of prolonged and deliberate scientific search in a\r\nregion which is known to be fossiliferous; sometimes in such a prosaic\r\nmanner as the digging of a well. Among discoveries of a highly\r\nsuggestive, almost romantic kind, perhaps none is more remarkable than\r\nthe one I shall now describe.\r\n\r\n_Discovery of the Great Dinosaur Quarry._ In central Wyoming, at the\r\nhead of a \"draw,\" or small valley, not far from the Medicine Bow\r\nRiver, lies the ruin of a small and unique building, which marks the\r\nsite of the greatest \"find\" of extinct animals made in a single\r\nlocality in any part of the world. The fortunate fossil-hunter who\r\nstumbled on this site was Mr. Walter Granger of the American Museum\r\nexpedition of 1897.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1898, as I approached the hillock on which the ruin\r\nstands, I observed, among the beautiful flowers, the blooming cacti,\r\nand the dwarf bushes of the desert, what were apparently numbers of\r\ndark-brown boulders. On closer examination, it proved that there is\r\nreally not a single rock, hardly even a pebble, on this hillock; all\r\nthese apparent boulders are ponderous fossils which have slowly\r\naccumulated or washed out on the surface from a great dinosaur bed\r\nbeneath. A Mexican sheep-herder had collected some of these petrified\r\nbones for the foundations of his cabin, the first ever built of such\r\nstrange materials. The excavation of a promising outcrop was almost\r\nimmediately rewarded by finding a thigh-bone nearly six feet in length\r\nwhich sloped downward into the earth, running into the lower leg and\r\nfinally into the foot, with all the respective parts lying in the\r\nnatural position as in life. This proved to be the previously unknown\r\nhind limb of the great dinosaur _Diplodocus_.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the \"Bone-Cabin Quarry\" was discovered and christened.\r\nThe total contents of the quarry are represented in the diagram (not\r\nreprinted.) It has given us, by dint of six successive years of hard\r\nwork, the materials for an almost complete revival of the life of the\r\nLaramie region as it was in the days of the dinosaurs. By the aid of\r\nworkmen of every degree of skill, by grace of the accumulated wisdom\r\nof the nineteenth century, by the constructive imagination, by the aid\r\nof the sculptor and the artist, we can summon these living forms and\r\nthe living environment from the vasty deep of the past.\r\n\r\n_The Famous Como Bluffs._ The circumstances leading up to our\r\ndiscovery serve to introduce the story. From 1890 to 1897 we had been\r\nsteadily delving into the history of the Age of Mammals, in deposits\r\ndating from two hundred thousand to three million years back, as we\r\nrudely estimate geological time. In the course of seven years such\r\nsubstantial progress had been made that I decided to push into the\r\nhistory of the Age of Reptiles also, and, following the pioneers,\r\nMarsh and Cope, to begin exploration in the period which at once marks\r\nthe dawn of mammalian life and the climax of the evolution of the\r\ngreat amphibious dinosaurs.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1897 we accordingly began exploration in the heart of\r\nthe Laramie Plains, on the Como Bluffs. On arrival, we found numbers\r\nof massive bones strewn along the base of these bluffs, tumbled from\r\ntheir stratum above, too weather-worn to attract collectors, and\r\nserving only to remind one of the time when these animals--the\r\ngreatest, by far, that nature has ever produced on land--were monarchs\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nAroused from sleep on a clear evening in camp by the heavy rumble of\r\na passing Union Pacific freight-train[21], I shall never forget my\r\nmeditations on the contrast between the imaginary picture of the great\r\nAge of Dinosaurs, fertile in cycads and in a wonderful variety of\r\nreptiles, and the present age of steam, of heavy locomotives toiling\r\nthrough the semi-arid and partly desert Laramie Plains.\r\n\r\nSo many animals had already been removed from these bluffs that we\r\nwere not very sanguine of finding more; but after a fortnight our\r\nprospecting was rewarded by finding parts of skeletons of the\r\nlong-limbed dinosaur _Diplodocus_ and of the heavy-limbed dinosaur\r\n_Brontosaurus_. The whole summer was occupied in taking these animals\r\nout for shipment to the East, the so-called \"plaster method\" of\r\nremoval being applied with the greatest success. Briefly, this is a\r\nsurgical device applied on a large scale for the \"setting\" of the\r\nmuch-fractured bones of a fossilized skeleton. It consists in setting\r\ngreat blocks of the skeleton, stone and all, in a firm capsule of\r\nplaster subsequently reinforced by great splints of wood, firmly drawn\r\ntogether with wet rawhide. The object is to keep all the fragments and\r\nsplinters of bone together until it can reach the skilful hands of the\r\nmuseum preparator.\r\n\r\n_The Rock Waves Connecting the Bluffs and the Quarry._ The Como Bluffs\r\nare about ten miles south of the Bone-Cabin Quarry; between them is a\r\nbroad stretch of the Laramie Plains. The exposed bone layer in the two\r\nlocalities is of the same age, and originally was a continuous level\r\nstratum which may be designated as the \"dinosaur beds;\" but this\r\nstratum, disturbed and crowded by the uplifting of the not far-distant\r\nLaramie range of mountains and the Freeze Out Hills, was thrown into a\r\nnumber of great folds or rock waves. Large portions, especially of the\r\nupfolds, or \"anticlines,\" of the waves, have been subsequently removed\r\nby erosion; the edges of these upfolds have been exposed, thus\r\nweathering out their fossilized contents, while downfolds are still\r\nburied beneath the earth for the explorers of coming centuries.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as one rides across the country to-day from the bluffs to\r\nthe quarry, startling the intensely modern fauna, the prong-horn\r\nantelopes, jack-rabbits, and sage-chickens, he is passing over a vast\r\ngraveyard which has been profoundly folded and otherwise shaken up and\r\ndisturbed. Sometimes one finds the bone layer removed entirely,\r\nsometimes horizontal, sometimes oblique, and again dipping directly\r\ninto the heart of the earth. This layer (dinosaur beds) is not more\r\nthan two hundred and seventy-four feet in thickness, and is altogether\r\nof fresh-water origin; but as a proof of the oscillations of the\r\nearth-level both before and after this great thin sheet of fresh-water\r\nrock was so widely spread, there are evidences of the previous\r\ninvasion of the sea (ichthyosaur beds) and of the subsequent invasion\r\nof the sea (mosasaur beds) in the whole Rocky Mountain region.\r\n\r\nIn traveling through the West, when once one has grasped the idea of\r\ncontinental oscillation, or submergence and emergence of the land, of\r\nthe sequence of the marine and fresh-water deposits in laying down\r\nthese pages of earth-history, he will know exactly where to look for\r\nthis wonderful layer-bed of the giant dinosaurs; he will find that,\r\nowing to the uplift of various mountain-ranges, it outcrops along the\r\nentire eastern face of the Rockies, around the Black Hills, and in all\r\nparts of the Laramie Plains; it yields dinosaur bones everywhere, but\r\nby no means so profusely or so perfectly as in the two famous\r\nlocalities we are describing.\r\n\r\n_How the Skeletons Lie in the Bluffs and Quarry._ At the bluffs single\r\nanimals lie from twenty to one hundred feet apart; one rarely finds a\r\nwhole skeleton, such as that of Marsh's _Brontosaurus excelsus_, the\r\nfinest specimen ever secured here, which is now one of the treasures\r\nof the Yale museum. More frequently a half or a third of a skeleton\r\nlies together.\r\n\r\nIn the Bone-Cabin Quarry, on the other hand, we came across a\r\nveritable Noah's-ark deposit, a perfect museum of all the animals of\r\nthe period. Here are the largest of the giant dinosaurs closely\r\nmingled with the remains of the smaller but powerful carnivorous\r\ndinosaurs which preyed upon them, also those of the slow and\r\nheavy-moving armored dinosaurs of the period, as well as of the\r\nlightest and most bird-like of the dinosaurs. Finely rounded, complete\r\nlimbs from eight to ten feet in length are found, especially those of\r\nthe carnivorous dinosaurs, perfect even to the sharply pointed and\r\nrecurved tips of their toes. Other limbs and bones are so crushed and\r\ndistorted by pressure that it is not worth while removing them.\r\nSixteen series of vertebræ were found strung together; among these\r\nwere eight long strings of tail-bones. The occurrence of these tails\r\nis less surprising when we come to study the important and varied\r\nfunctions of the tail in these animals, and the consequent connection\r\nof the tail-bones by means of stout tendons and ligaments which held\r\nthem together for a long period after death. Skulls are fragile and\r\nrare in the quarry, because in every one of these big skeletons there\r\nwere no fewer than ninety distinct bones which exceeded the head in\r\nsize, the excess in most cases being enormous.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 45.--COLLECTING DINOSAURS AT BONE-CABIN\r\n  QUARRY.\r\n  a. The overlying soil and rocks are loosened with a pick and\r\n  removed with team and scraper down to the fossil layer.\r\n\r\n  b. The fossil layer is carefully prospected with small tools,\r\n  chisels, awls and whisk brooms exposing the bones as they lie in\r\n  the rocks.\r\n\r\n  c. The blocks containing the fossils are channelled around,\r\n  plastered over top and sides, undercut and carefully turned over\r\n  and the under side trimmed and plastered.\r\n\r\n  d. The blocks are then packed in boxes or crates with hay or any\r\n  other available packing material.\r\n\r\n  e. Boxes are loaded on wagons and hauled across country to the\r\n  railroad.\r\n\r\n  f. Boxes are finally loaded on cars and shipped through to New\r\n  York City.]\r\n\r\nThe bluffs appear to represent the region of an ancient shoreline,\r\nsuch conditions as we have depicted in the restoration of\r\n_Brontosaurus_ (fig. 22)--the sloping banks of a muddy estuary or of a\r\nlagoon, either bare tidal flats or covered with vegetation. Evidently\r\nthe dinosaurs were buried at or near the spot where they perished.\r\n\r\nThe Bone-Cabin Quarry deposit represents entirely different\r\nconditions. The theory that it is the accumulation of a flood is, in\r\nmy opinion, improbable, because a flood would tend to bring entire\r\nskeletons down together, distribute them widely, and bury them\r\nrapidly. A more likely theory is that this was the area of an old\r\nriver-bar, which in its shallow waters arrested the more or less\r\ndecomposed and scattered carcasses which had slowly drifted\r\ndown-stream toward it, including a great variety of dinosaurs,\r\ncrocodiles, and turtles, collected from many points up-stream. Thus\r\nwere brought together the animals of a whole region, a fact which\r\nvastly enhances the interest of this deposit.\r\n\r\n_The Giant Herbivorous Dinosaurs._ By far the most imposing of these\r\nanimals are those which may be popularly designated as the great or\r\ngiant dinosaurs. The name, derived from _deinos_ terrible, and\r\n_sauros_ lizard, refers to the fact that they appeared externally like\r\nenormous lizards, with very long limbs, necks, and tails. They were\r\nactually remotely related to the tuatera lizard of New Zealand, and\r\nstill more remotely to the true lizards.\r\n\r\nNo land animals have ever approached these giant dinosaurs in size,\r\nand naturally the first point of interest is the architecture of the\r\nskeleton. The backbone is indeed a marvel. The fitness of the\r\nconstruction consists, like that of the American truss-bridge, in\r\nattaining the maximum of strength with the minimum of weight. It is\r\nbrought about by dispensing with every cubic millimeter of bone which\r\ncan be spared without weakening the vertebræ for the various stresses\r\nand strains to which they were subjected, and these must have been\r\ntremendous in an animal from sixty to seventy feet in length. The\r\nbodies of the vertebræ are of hour-glass shape, with great lateral and\r\ninterior cavities; the arches are constructed on the T-iron principle\r\nof the modern bridge-builder, the back spines are tubular, the\r\ninterior is spongy, these devices being employed in great variety, and\r\nconstituting a mechanical triumph of size, lightness, and strength\r\ncombined. Comparing a great chambered dinosaurian (_Camarasaurus_)\r\nvertebra (see above) with the weight per cubic inch of an ostrich\r\nvertebra, we reach the astonishing conclusion that it weighed only\r\ntwenty-one pounds, or half the weight of a whale vertebra of the same\r\nbulk. The skeleton of a whale seventy-four feet in length has recently\r\nbeen found by Mr. F.A. Lucas of the Brooklyn Museum to weigh seventeen\r\nthousand nine hundred and twenty pounds. The skeleton of a dinosaur of\r\nthe same length may be roughly estimated as not exceeding ten thousand\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n_Proofs of Rapid Movements on Land._ Lightness of skeleton is a\r\nwalking or running or flying adaptation, and not at all a swimming\r\none; a swimming animal needs gravity in its skeleton, because\r\nsufficient buoyancy in the water is always afforded by the lungs and\r\nsoft tissues of the body. The extraordinary lightness of these\r\ndinosaur vertebræ may therefore be put forward as proof of supreme\r\nfitness for the propulsion of an enormous frame during occasional\r\nincursions upon land[22]. There are additional facts which point to\r\nland progression, such as the point in the tail where the flexible\r\nstructure suddenly becomes rigid, as shown in the diagram of vertebræ\r\nbelow; the component joints are so solid and flattened on the lower\r\nsurface that they seem to demonstrate fitness to support partly the\r\nbody in a tripodal position like that of a kangaroo. I have therefore\r\nhazarded the view that even some of these enormous dinosaurs were\r\ncapable of raising themselves on their hind limbs, lightly resting on\r\nthe middle portion of the tail. In such a position the animal would\r\nhave been capable not only of browsing among the higher branches of\r\ntrees, but of defending itself against the carnivorous dinosaurs by\r\nusing its relatively short but heavy front limbs to ward off attacks.\r\n\r\nThere are also indications of aquatic habits in some of the giant\r\ndinosaurs which render it probable that a considerable part of their\r\nlife was led in the water. One of these indications is the backward\r\nposition of the nostrils. Many, but not all, water-living mammals and\r\nreptiles have the nostrils on top of the head, in order to breathe\r\nmore readily when the head is partly immersed. Another fact of note,\r\nalthough perhaps less conclusive, is the fitness of the tail for use\r\nwhile moving about in the water, if not in rapid swimming.\r\n\r\nThe great tail, measuring from twenty-eight to thirty feet, was one of\r\nthe most remarkable structures in these animals, and undoubtedly\r\nserved a great variety of purposes, propelling while in the water,\r\nbalancing and supporting and defending while on land. In _Diplodocus_\r\nit was most perfectly developed from its muscular base to its delicate\r\nand whip-like tip, perhaps for all these functions.\r\n\r\n_The Three Kinds of Giant Dinosaurs._ It is very remarkable that three\r\ndistinct kinds of these great dinosaurs lived at the same time in the\r\nsame general region, as proved by the fact that their remains are\r\nfreely commingled in the quarry.\r\n\r\nWhat were the differences in food and habits, in structure and in\r\ngait, which prevented that direct and active competition between like\r\ntypes in the struggle for existence which in the course of nature\r\nalways leads to the extermination of one or the other type? In the\r\nlast three years we have discovered very considerable differences of\r\nstructure which make it appear that these animals, while of the same\r\nor nearly the same linear dimensions, did not enter into direct\r\ncompetition either for food or for territory.\r\n\r\nThe dinosaur named _Diplodocus_ by Marsh is the most completely known\r\nof the three. Our very first discovery in the Bone-Cabin Quarry gave\r\nus the hint that _Diplodocus_ was distinguished by relatively long,\r\nslender limbs, and that it may be popularly known as the \"long-limbed\r\ndinosaur.\" The great skeleton found in the Como Bluffs enabled me to\r\nrestore for the first time the posterior half of one of these animals\r\nestimated as sixty feet in length, the hips and tail especially being\r\nin a perfect state of preservation. A larger animal, nearer seventy\r\nfeet in length, including the anterior half of the body, and still\r\nmore complete, was discovered about ten miles north of the quarry, and\r\nis now in the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburg. Combined, these two\r\nanimals have furnished a complete knowledge of the great bony frame.\r\nThe head is only two feet long, and is, therefore, small out of all\r\nproportion to the great body. The neck measures twenty-one feet four\r\ninches, and is by far the longest and largest neck known in any animal\r\nliving or extinct. The back is relatively very short, measuring ten\r\nfeet eight inches. The vertebræ of the hip measure two feet and three\r\ninches. The tail measures from thirty-two to forty feet. We thus\r\nobtain, as a moderate estimate of the total length of the animal,\r\nsixty-eight to seventy feet. The restored skeleton, published by Mr.\r\nJ.B. Hatcher in July, 1901, and partly embodying our results, gave to\r\nscience the first really accurate knowledge of the length of these\r\nanimals, which hitherto had been greatly overestimated. The highest\r\npoint in the body was above the hips; here in fact, was the center of\r\npower and motion, because, as observed above, the tail fairly balanced\r\nthe anterior part of the body.\r\n\r\nThe restoration by Mr. Knight is drawn from a very careful model made\r\nunder my direction, in which the proportions of the animal are\r\nprecisely estimated. It is, I think, accurate--for a restoration--as\r\nwell as interesting and up-to-date. These restorations are the\r\n\"working hypotheses\" of our science; they express the present state of\r\nour knowledge, and, being subject to modification by future\r\ndiscoveries, are liable to constant change.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the second type of giant dinosaur, the _Brontosaurus_, or\r\n\"thunder saurian\" of Marsh, as shown in the restoration (fig. 22), was\r\nfar more massive in structure and relatively shorter in body. Five\r\nmore or less complete skeletons are now to be seen in the Yale,\r\nAmerican, Carnegie, and Field Columbian museums. In 1898 we discovered\r\nin the bluffs, about three miles west of the Bone-Cabin Quarry, the\r\nlargest of these animals which has yet been found; it was worked out\r\nwith great care and is now being restored and mounted complete in the\r\nAmerican Museum. The thigh-bone is enormous, measuring five feet eight\r\ninches in length, and is relatively of greater mass than that of\r\n_Diplodocus_. The neck, chest, hips, and tail are correspondingly\r\nmassive. The neck is relatively shorter, however, measuring eighteen\r\nfeet, while in _Diplodocus_ it measures over twenty-one feet. The\r\ntotal length of this massive specimen is estimated at sixty-three\r\nfeet, or from six to eight feet less than the largest \"long-limbed\"\r\ndinosaur. The height of the skeleton at the hips is fifteen feet.\r\nThere is less direct evidence that the \"thunder saurian\" had the power\r\nof raising its fore quarters in the air than in the case of the\r\n\"light-limbed saurian,\" because no bend or supporting point in the\r\ntail has been distinctly observed.\r\n\r\nThe third type of giant dinosaur is the less completely known\r\n\"chambered saurian,\" the _Camarasaurus_ of Cope or _Morosaurus_ of\r\nMarsh, an animal more quadrupedal in gait or walking more habitually\r\non all fours, like the great _Cetiosaurus_, or \"whale saurian,\"\r\ndiscovered near Oxford, England. With its shorter tail and heavier\r\nfore limbs, it is still less probable that this animal had the power\r\nof raising the anterior part of its body from the ground. Of a related\r\ntype, perhaps, is the largest dinosaur ever found; this is the\r\n_Brachiosaurus_, limb-bones of which were discovered in central\r\nColorado in 1901 and are now preserved in the Field Columbian Museum\r\nof Chicago. Its thigh-bone is six feet eight inches in length, and its\r\nupper arm-bone, or humerus, is even slightly longer.\r\n\r\n_Feeding Habits of the Giant Dinosaurs._ We still have to solve one of\r\nthe most perplexing problems of fossil physiology; how did the very\r\nsmall head, provided with light jaws, slender and spoon-shaped teeth\r\nconfined to the anterior region, suffice to provide food for these\r\nmonsters? I have advanced the idea that the food of _Diplodocus_\r\nconsisted of some very abundant and nutritious species of water-plant;\r\nthat the clawed feet were used in uprooting such plants, while the\r\ndelicate anterior teeth were employed only for drawing them out of the\r\nwater; that the plants were drawn down the throat in large quantities\r\nwithout mastication, since there were no grinding or back teeth\r\nwhatever in this animal. Unfortunately for this theory, it is now\r\nfound that the front feet were not provided with many claws, there\r\nbeing only a single claw on the inner side. Nevertheless by some such\r\nmeans as this, these enormous animals could have obtained sufficient\r\nfood in the water to support their great bulk.\r\n\r\n_The Carnivorous Dinosaurs._ Mingling with the larger bones in the\r\nquarry are the more or less perfect remains of swamp turtles, of dwarf\r\ncrocodiles, of the entirely different group of plated dinosaurs, or\r\n_Stegosauria_, but especially of two entirely distinct kinds of large\r\nand small flesh-eating dinosaurs. The latter rounded out and gave\r\nvariety to the dinosaur society, and there is no doubt that they\r\nserved the savage but useful purpose, rendered familiar by the\r\ndoctrine of Malthus, of checking overpopulation. These fierce animals\r\nhad the same remote ancestry as the giant dinosaurs, but had gradually\r\nacquired entirely different habits and appearance.\r\n\r\nFar inferior in size, they were superior in agility, exclusively\r\nbipedal, with very long, powerful hind limbs, upon which they advanced\r\nby running or springing, and with short fore limbs, the exact uses of\r\nwhich are difficult to ascertain. Both hands and feet were provided\r\nwith powerful tearing claws. On the hind foot is the back claw, so\r\ncharacteristic of the birds, which during the Triassic period left its\r\nfaint impression almost everywhere in the famous Connecticut valley\r\nimprints of these animals. That the fore limb and hand were of some\r\ndistinct use is proved by the enormous size of the thumb-claw; while\r\nthe hand may not have conveyed food to the mouth, it may have served\r\nto seize and tear the prey. As to the actual pose in feeding, there\r\ncan be little doubt as to its general similarity to that of the\r\n_Raptores_ among the birds, as suggested to me by Dr. Wortman (see\r\nfig. 10); one of the hind feet rested on the prey, the other upon the\r\nground, the body being further balanced or supported by the vertebræ\r\nof the tail. The animal was thus in a position to apply its teeth and\r\nexert all the power of its very powerful arched back in tearing off\r\nits food. That the gristle of the bone or cartilage was very palatable\r\nis attested not only by the toothmarks upon these bones, but by many\r\nsimilar markings found in the Bone-Cabin Quarry.\r\n\r\n_The Bird-Catching Dinosaur._ Of all the bird-like dinosaurs which\r\nhave been discovered, none possesses greater similitude to the birds\r\nthan the gem of the quarry, the little animal about seven feet in\r\nlength which we have named _Ornitholestes_, or the \"bird-catching\r\ndinosaur.\" It was a marvel of speed, agility, and delicacy of\r\nconstruction. Externally its bones are simple and solid-looking, but\r\nas a matter of fact they are mere shells, the walls being hardly\r\nthicker than paper, the entire interior of the bone having been\r\nremoved by the action of the same marvelous law of adaptation which\r\nsculptured the vertebræ of its huge contemporaries. There is no\r\nevidence, however, that these hollow bones were filled with air from\r\nthe lungs, as in the case of the bones of birds. The foot is\r\nbird-like; the hand is still more so; in fact, no dinosaur hand has\r\never before been found which so closely mimics that of a bird in the\r\ngreat elongation of the first or index-finger, in the abbreviation of\r\nthe thumb and middle finger, and in the reduction of the ring-finger.\r\nThese fingers, with sharp claws, were not strong enough for climbing,\r\nand the only special fitness we have been able to imagine is that they\r\nwere used for the grasping of a light and agile prey (see figs. 17,\r\n18.)\r\n\r\nAnother reason for the venture of designating this animal as the\r\n\"bird-catcher\" is that the Jurassic birds (not thus far discovered in\r\nAmerica, but known from the _Archæopteryx_ of Germany) were not so\r\nactive or such strong fliers as existing birds; in fact, they were not\r\nunlike the little dinosaur itself. They were toothed, long-tailed,\r\nshort-armed, the body was feathered instead of scaled; they rose\r\nslowly from the ground. This renders it probable that they were the\r\nprey of the smaller pneumatic-built dinosaurs such as the present\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nThis hypothetical bird-catcher seems to have been designed to spring\r\nupon a delicately built prey, the structure being the very antipode of\r\nthat of the large carnivorous dinosaurs. A difficulty in the\r\nbird-catching theory, namely, that the teeth are not as sharp as one\r\nwould expect to find them in a flesh-eater, is somewhat offset by the\r\nsimilarity of the teeth to those of the bird-eating monitor lizards\r\n(_Varanus_), which are not especially sharp.\r\n\r\n_The Great Yield of the Quarry._ Our explorations in the quarry began\r\nin the spring of 1898, and have continued ever since during favorable\r\nweather. The total area explored at the close of the sixth year was\r\nseven thousand two hundred and fifty square feet. Not one of the\r\ntwelve-foot squares into which the quarry was plotted lacked its\r\ncovering of bones, and in some cases the bones were two or three deep.\r\nEach year we have expected to come to the end of this great deposit,\r\nbut it still yields a large return, although we have reason to believe\r\nthat we have exhausted the richest portions.\r\n\r\nWe have taken up four hundred and eighty-three parts of animals, some\r\nof which may belong to the same individuals. These were packed in two\r\nhundred and seventy-five boxes, representing a gross weight of nearly\r\none hundred thousand pounds. Reckoning from the number of thigh-bones,\r\nwe reach, as a rough estimate of the total, seventy-three animals of\r\nthe following kinds: giant herbivorous dinosaurs, 44; plated\r\nherbivorous dinosaurs, or stegosaurs, 3; iguanodonts or smaller\r\nherbivorous dinosaurs, 4; large carnivorous dinosaurs, 6; small\r\ncarnivorous dinosaurs, 3; crocodiles, 4; turtles, 5. But this\r\nrepresents only a part of the whole deposit, which we know to be of\r\ntwice the extent already explored, and these figures do not include\r\nthe bones which were partly washed out and used in the construction\r\nof the Bone-Cabin. The grand total would probably include parts of\r\nover one hundred giant dinosaurs.\r\n\r\n_The Struggle for Existence Among the Dinosaurs._ Never in the whole\r\nhistory of the world as we now know it have there been such remarkable\r\nland scenes as were presented when the reign of these titanic reptiles\r\nwas at its climax. It was also the prevailing life-picture of England,\r\nGermany, South America, and India. We can imagine herds of these\r\ncreatures from fifty to eighty feet in length, with limbs and gait\r\nanalogous to those of gigantic elephants, but with bodies extending\r\nthrough the long, flexible, and tapering necks into the diminutive\r\nheads, and reaching back into the equally long and still more tapering\r\ntails. The four or five varieties which existed together were each\r\nfitted to some special mode of life; some living more exclusively on\r\nland, others for longer periods in the water.\r\n\r\nThe competition for existence was not only with the great carnivorous\r\ndinosaurs, but with other kinds of herbivorous dinosaurs (the\r\niguanodonts), which had much smaller bodies to sustain and a much\r\nsuperior tooth mechanism for the taking of food.\r\n\r\nThe cutting off of this giant dinosaur dynasty was nearly if not quite\r\nsimultaneous the world over. The explanation which is deducible from\r\nsimilar catastrophes to other large types of animals is that a very\r\nlarge frame, with a limited and specialized set of teeth fitted only\r\nto a certain special food, is a dangerous combination of characters.\r\nSuch a monster organism is no longer adaptable; any serious change of\r\nconditions which would tend to eliminate the special food would also\r\neliminate these great animals as a necessary consequence.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 46.--Badlands on the Red Deer River in\r\n  Alberta. This region is the richest known collecting ground for\r\n  cretacic dinosaurs.]\r\n\r\nThere is an entirely different class of explanations, however, to be\r\nconsidered, which are consistent both with the continued fitness of\r\nstructure of the giant dinosaurs themselves and with the survival of\r\ntheir especial food; such, for example, as the introduction of a _new\r\nenemy_ more deadly even than the great carnivorous dinosaurs. Among\r\nsuch theories the most ingenious is that of the late Professor Cope,\r\nwho suggested that some of the small, inoffensive, and inconspicuous\r\nforms of Jurassic mammals, of the size of the shrew and the hedgehog,\r\ncontracted the habit of seeking out the nests of these dinosaurs,\r\ngnawing through the shells of their eggs, and thus destroying the\r\nyoung. The appearance, or evolution, of any egg-destroying animals,\r\nwhether reptiles or mammals, which could attack this great race at\r\nsuch a defenseless point would be rapidly followed by its extinction.\r\nWe must accordingly be on the alert for all possible theories of\r\nextinction; and these theories themselves will fall under the\r\nuniversal principle of the survival of the fittest until we\r\napproximate or actually hit upon the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL HUNTING BY BOAT IN CANADA.\r\n\r\n_By Barnum Brown._\r\n\r\n\"How do you know where to look for fossils?\" is a common question. In\r\ngeneral it may be answered that the surface of North America has been\r\npretty well explored by government surveys and scientific expeditions\r\nand the geologic age of the larger areas determined. Most important in\r\ndetermining the geologic sequence of the earth's strata are the fossil\r\nremains of animal and plant life. A grouping of distinct species of\r\nfossils correlated with stratigraphic characters in the rocks\r\ndetermines these subdivisions. When a collection of fossils is desired\r\nto represent a certain period, exploring parties are sent to these\r\nknown areas. Sometimes however, chance information leads up to most\r\nimportant discoveries, such as resulted from the work of the past two\r\nseasons in Alberta, Canada.\r\n\r\nA visitor to the Museum, Mr. J.L. Wagner, while examining our mineral\r\ncollections saw the large bones in the Reptile Hall and remarked to\r\nthe Curator of Mineralogy that he had seen many similar bones near his\r\nranch in the Red Deer Cañon of Alberta. After talking some time an\r\ninvitation was extended to the writer to visit his home and prospect\r\nthe cañon. Accordingly in the fall of 1909 a preliminary trip was made\r\nto the locality.\r\n\r\nFrom Didsbury, a little town north of Calgary, the writer drove\r\neastward ninety miles to the Red Deer River through a portion of the\r\nnewly opened grain belt of Alberta, destined in the near future to\r\nproduce a large part of the world's bread. Near the railroad the land\r\nis mostly under cultivation and comfortable homes and bountiful grain\r\nfields testify to the rich nature of the soil. A few miles eastward\r\nthe brushland gives way to a level expanse of grass-covered prairie\r\ndotted here and there by large and small lakes probably of glacial\r\norigin. Mile after mile the road follows section lines and one is\r\nrarely out of sight of the house of some \"homesteader.\" It is through\r\nthis level farm land that the Red Deer River wends its way flowing\r\nthrough a cañon far below the surface. Near Wagner's ranch the cañon\r\nwas prospected and so many bones found that it appeared most\r\ndesirable to do extended searching along the river.\r\n\r\nUsually fossils are found in \"bad lands,\" where extensive areas are\r\ndenuded of grass and the surface eroded into hills and ravines. A camp\r\nis located near some spring or stream and collectors ride or walk over\r\nmiles of these exposures in each direction till the region is\r\nthoroughly explored. Quite different are conditions on the Red Deer\r\nRiver. Cutting through the prairie land the river had formed a cañon\r\ntwo to five hundred feet deep and rarely more than a mile wide at the\r\ntop. In places the walls are nearly perpendicular and the river winds\r\nin its narrow valley, touching one side then crossing to the other so\r\nthat it is impossible to follow up or down its course any great\r\ndistance even on horseback.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the most feasible way to work these banks was from\r\na boat; consequently in the summer of 1910 our party proceeded to the\r\ntown of Red Deer, where the Calgary-Edmonton railroad crosses the\r\nriver. There a flatboat, twelve by thirty feet in dimension, was\r\nconstructed on lines similar to a western ferry boat, having a\r\ncarrying capacity of eight tons with a twenty-two foot oar at each end\r\nto direct its course. The rapid current averaging about four miles per\r\nhour precluded any thought of going up stream in a large boat, so it\r\nwas constructed on lines sufficiently generous to form a living boat\r\nas well as to carry the season's collection of fossils.\r\n\r\nSupplied with a season's provisions, lumber for boxes, and plaster for\r\nencasing bones, we began our fossil cruise down a cañon which once\r\nechoed songs of the _Bois brulé_, for this was at one time the fur\r\nterritory of the great Hudson Bay Company.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 47.--American Museum Expedition on the Red\r\n  Deer River. Fossils secured along the banks were packed and loaded\r\n  aboard the large scow and floated down the river to the railway\r\n  station.]\r\n\r\nNo more interesting or instructive journey has ever been taken by the\r\nwriter. High up on the plateau, buildings and haystacks proclaim a\r\nwell-settled country, but habitations are rarely seen from the river\r\nand for miles we floated through picturesque solitude unbroken save by\r\nthe roar of the rapids.\r\n\r\nEspecially characteristic of this cañon are the slides where the\r\ncurrent setting against the bank has undermined it until a mountain of\r\nearth slips into the river, in some cases almost choking its course.\r\nA continual sorting thus goes on, the finer material being carried\r\naway while the boulders are left as barriers forming slow moving\r\nreaches of calm water and stretches of rapids difficult to navigate\r\nduring low water. In one of these slides we found several small mammal\r\njaws and teeth not known before from Canada, associated with fossil\r\nclam shells of Eocene age.\r\n\r\nThe long midsummer days in latitude 52° gave many working hours, but\r\nwith frequent stops to prospect the banks we rarely floated more than\r\ntwenty miles per day. An occasional flock of ducks and geese were\r\ndisturbed as our boat approached and bank beaver houses were\r\nfrequently passed, but few of the animals were seen during the\r\ndaytime. Tying the boat to a tree at night we would go ashore to camp\r\namong the trees where after dinner pipes were smoked in the glow of a\r\ngreat camp fire. Only a fossil hunter or a desert traveler can fully\r\nappreciate the luxury of abundant wood and running water. In the\r\nstillness of the night the underworld was alive and many little feet\r\nrustled the leaves where daylight disclosed no sound. Then the beaver\r\nand muskrat swam up to investigate this new intruder, while from the\r\ntree-tops came the constant query, \"Who! Who!\"\r\n\r\nFor seventy miles the country is thickly wooded with pine and poplar,\r\nthe stately spruce trees silhouetted against the sky adding a charm to\r\nthe ever changing scene. Nature has also been kind to the treeless\r\nregions beyond, for underneath the fertile prairie, veins of good\r\nlignite coal of varying thickness are successively cut by the river.\r\nIn many places these are worked in the river banks during winter. One\r\nvein of excellent quality is eighteen feet thick, although usually\r\nthey are much thinner. The government right has been taken to mine\r\nmost of this coal outcropping along the river.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 48.--Locality of Ankylosaurus skull in\r\n  Edmonton formation in Red Deer River. The skull is in the rock\r\n  just above the pick, about the center of the photograph.]\r\n\r\nAlong the upper portion of the stream are banks of Eocene age, from\r\nwhich shells and mammal jaws were secured, but near the town of\r\nContent where the river bends southward, a new series of rocks\r\nappeared and in these our search was rewarded by finding dinosaur\r\nbones similar to those seen at Wagner's ranch. Specimens were found in\r\nincreasing numbers as we continued our journey, and progress down the\r\nriver was necessarily much slower. Frequently the boat would be tied\r\nup a week or more at one camp while we searched the banks, examining\r\nthe cliffs layer by layer that no fossil might escape observation.\r\nWith the little dingey the opposite side of the river was reached so\r\nthat both sides were covered at the same time from one camp. As soon\r\nas a mile or more had been prospected or a new specimen secured, the\r\nboat was dropped down to a new convenient anchorage. Box after box was\r\nadded to the collection till scarcely a cubit's space remained\r\nunoccupied on board our fossil ark.\r\n\r\nWhere prairie badlands are eroded in innumerable buttes and ravines it\r\nis always doubtful if one has seen all exposures, so there was\r\npeculiar satisfaction in making a thorough search of these river banks\r\nknowing that few if any fossils had escaped observation. On account of\r\nthe heavy rainfall and frequent sliding of banks new fossils are\r\nexposed every season so that in a few years these same banks can again\r\nbe explored profitably. This river will become as classic hunting\r\nground for reptile remains as the Badlands of South Dakota are for\r\nmammals.\r\n\r\nAlthough the summer days are long in this latitude the season is short\r\nand thousands of geese flying southward foretell the early winter.\r\nWhere the temperature is not infrequently forty to sixty degrees below\r\nzero in winter, it is difficult to think of a time when a warm\r\nclimate could have prevailed, yet such condition is indicated by the\r\nfossil plants.\r\n\r\nWhen the weather became too cold to work with plaster, the fossils\r\nwere shipped from a branch railroad forty-five miles distant, the camp\r\nmaterial was stored for the winter and with block and tackle the big\r\nboat was hauled up on shore above the reach of high water.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1911 the boat was recalked and again launched when we\r\ncontinued our search from the point at which work closed the previous\r\nyear. During the summer we were visited by the Museum's President,\r\nProf. Henry Fairfield Osborn, and one of the Trustees, Mr. Madison\r\nGrant. A canoeing trip, one of great interest and pleasure, was taken\r\nwith our visitors covering two hundred and fifty miles down the river\r\nfrom the town of Red Deer, during which valuable material was added to\r\nthe collection and important geological data secured.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the Canadian work the Museum is enriched by a\r\nmagnificent collection of Cretaceous fossils some of which are new to\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Transactions Kansas Academy of Science, p. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: From Fossil Wonders of the West.
