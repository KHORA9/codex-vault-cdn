The latter, particularly,\r\nconjures up visions of anarchists, bombs, and all manner of wickedness.\r\nYet the time seems to be coming when every farmer will regard\r\nexplosives, of the general type known to the public as dynamite, as\r\namong his most trusty implements. It is so already in some places. In\r\nthe United States explosives have been used for years, owing to the\r\nexertions of the Du Pont Powder Company, while Messrs Curtiss' and\r\nHarvey, and Messrs Nobels, the great explosive manufacturers, are busy\r\nintroducing them in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps be interesting first of all to see what this\r\nterror-striking compound is. One essential feature is the harmless gas\r\nwhich constitutes the bulk of our atmosphere, nitrogen. Ordinarily one\r\nof the most lazy, inactive, inert of substances, this gas will, under\r\ncertain circumstances, enter into combination with others, and when it\r\ndoes so it becomes in some cases the very reverse of its usual peaceful,\r\nlethargic self. It is as if it entered reluctantly into these compounds\r\nand so introduced an element of instability into them. It is like a\r\ndissatisfied partner in a business, ready to break up the whole\r\ncombination on very slight provocation.\r\n\r\nAnd it must be remembered that an explosive is simply some chemical\r\ncompound which can change _suddenly_ into something else of much larger\r\nvolume. Water, when boiled, increases to about 1600 times its own volume\r\nof steam, and if it were possible to bring about the change suddenly\r\nwater would be a fairly powerful explosive. Coal burnt in a fire\r\nchanges, with oxygen from the atmosphere, into carbonic acid gas, and\r\nthe volume of that latter which is so produced is much more than that of\r\nthe combined volumes of the oxygen and coal. When the burning takes\r\nplace in a grate or furnace we see nothing at all like an explosion, for\r\nthe simple reason that the change takes place gradually. That is\r\nnecessarily so since the coal and oxygen are only in contact at the\r\nsurface of the former. If, however, we grind the coal to a very fine\r\npowder and mix it well with air, then each fine particle is in contact\r\nwith oxygen and can burn instantly. Hence coal-dust in air is an\r\nexplosive. It used to be thought that colliery accidents were due\r\nentirely to the explosion of methane, a gas which is given off by the\r\ncoal, but it has of recent years dawned upon people that it is the\r\ncoal-dust in the mine which really does the damage. The explosion of\r\nmethane stirs up the dust, which then explodes. The former is\r\ncomparatively harmless, but it acts as the trigger or detonator which\r\nlets loose the force pent up in the innocent-looking coal-dust. Hence\r\nthe greatest efforts in modern collieries are bent towards ridding the\r\nworkings of dust or else damping it or in some other way preventing it\r\nfrom being stirred up into the dangerous state.\r\n\r\nSo the essential feature of any explosive is oxygen and something which\r\nwill burn with it. If it be a solid or liquid the oxygen must be a part\r\nof the combination or mixture, for it cannot get air from the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere quickly enough to explode; and, moreover, it is\r\ngenerally necessary that explosives should work in a confined space away\r\nfrom all contact with air. So oxygen, of necessity, must be an integral\r\npart of the stuff itself. But when oxygen combines with anything it\r\nusually clings rather tenaciously to its place in the compound and is\r\nnot easily disturbed quickly, and that is where the nitrogen seems to\r\nfind its part. It supplies the disturbing element in what would\r\notherwise be a harmonious combination, so that the oxygen and the\r\nburnable substances readily split up and form a new combination, with\r\nthe nitrogen left out.\r\n\r\nOf all the harmless things in the world one would think that that sweet,\r\nsticky fluid, glycerine, which most of us have used at one time or\r\nanother to lubricate a sore throat, was the most harmless. As it stands\r\nin its bottle upon the domestic medicine shelf, who would suspect that\r\nit is the basis of such a thing as dynamite?\r\n\r\nSuch is the case, however, for glycerine on being brought into contact\r\nwith a mixture of sulphuric and nitric acids gives birth to\r\nnitro-glycerine, an explosive of such sensitivity, of such a furious,\r\nviolent nature, that it is never allowed to remain long in its primitive\r\ncondition, but is as quickly as possible changed into something less\r\nexcitable.\r\n\r\nGlycerine is one of those organic compounds which is obtained from\r\nonce-living matter. Arising as a by-product in the manufacture of soap,\r\nit consists, as do so many of the organic substances, of carbon and\r\nhydrogen, the atoms of which are peculiarly arranged to form the\r\nglycerine molecule. To this the nitric acid adds oxygen and nitrogen,\r\nthe sulphuric acid simply standing by, as it were, and removing the\r\nsurplus water which arises during the process. So while glycerine is\r\ncarbon and hydrogen, nitro-glycerine is carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and\r\noxygen. In this state they form a compact liquid, which occupies little\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nThe least thing upsets them, however. The carbon combines with oxygen\r\ninto carbon dioxide, commonly called carbonic acid gas, the hydrogen and\r\nsome more oxygen form steam, while the nitrogen is left out in the cold,\r\nso to speak. And the total volume of the gases so produced is about 6000\r\ntimes that of the original liquid. It is easy to see that a substance\r\nwhich is liable suddenly to increase its volume by 6000 times is an\r\nexplosive of no mean order.\r\n\r\nBut the fact that it is liable to make this change on a comparatively\r\nslight increase in temperature or after a concussion makes it too\r\ndangerous for practical use. It needs to be tamed down somewhat. This\r\nwas first done by the famous Nobel, who mixed it with a fine earth known\r\nas kieselguhr, whereby its sensitiveness was much decreased. This\r\nmixture is dynamite.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the function of the \"earth\" is simply to act as an\r\nabsorbent of the liquid nitro-glycerine, and several other things can be\r\nused for the same purpose. Moreover, there are now many explosives of\r\nthe dynamite nature but differing from it in having an active instead of\r\na passive absorbent, so that the decrease in sensitivity is accompanied\r\nby an increase in strength. For example, gelignite, which is being used\r\nfor agricultural purposes in Great Britain, consists of nitro-glycerine\r\nmixed with nitro-cotton, wood-meal and saltpetre. The wood-meal acts as\r\nthe absorbent instead of the kieselguhr, while the nitro-cotton is\r\nanother kind of explosive and the saltpetre, one of the ingredients in\r\nthe old gunpowder, provides the necessary oxygen for burning up the\r\nwood-meal. Nitro-cotton is made in much the same way as nitro-glycerine,\r\nexcept that cotton takes the place of the glycerine. Cotton is almost\r\npure cellulose, another organic substance, like glycerine insomuch as it\r\nis composed of carbon and hydrogen, but, unlike it, containing also\r\noxygen. Treated with nitric acid it also forms a combination of carbon,\r\nhydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, which is called nitro-cotton,\r\nnitro-cellulose, or gun-cotton.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, why, if these two substances are thus similar, need\r\nthey be mixed? The answer is that although alike to a certain degree\r\nthey are not exactly the same, and the modern manufacturer of explosives\r\nin his strife after perfection finds that for certain purposes one is\r\nthe best, and for others another, while for others again a combination\r\nmay excel any single one.\r\n\r\nFor some work another kind of explosive altogether is to be preferred.\r\nThis is based upon chlorate of potash, a compound very rich in oxygen,\r\nwhich it is prepared to give up readily to burn any other suitable\r\nelement which may be at hand. A well-known explosive of this class is\r\nthat known as cheddite, since it was first made at a factory at Chedde,\r\nin Savoy.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of simplicity, however, I propose in the following\r\ndescriptions to refer to all these explosives under the common term\r\n\"dynamite,\" since that will probably convey to the general public an\r\nidea of their nature better than any other term or terms which I could\r\nchoose.\r\n\r\nSo now we come to the great question, how can the modern farmer benefit\r\nby the use of high explosives such as these? The answer is, in many\r\nways. Let us take the most obvious one first.\r\n\r\nA farmer has been ploughing his land and growing his crops upon it for\r\nyears. Perchance his forefathers have been doing the same for\r\ngenerations. Every year, for centuries possibly, a hard steel\r\nploughshare has gone over that ground, turning over and over the top\r\nsoil to a depth of six to eight inches. Each season the plants, whatever\r\nthey may be, grow mainly in that top layer. They take the goodness or\r\nnourishment out of it and it eventually becomes more or less sterile. By\r\nproperly rotating his crops he mitigates this to a certain extent, in\r\naddition to which he restores to the land some of its old nitrogenous\r\nconstituents by the addition of manure. Yet, do what he will, this thin\r\ntop layer is bound to become exhausted. And all the while a few inches\r\nlower down there is almost virgin soil which has scarcely been disturbed\r\nsince the creation of the world.\r\n\r\nNay, more, that virgin soil, with all its plant food still in it, is not\r\nonly doing little for its owner, it is positively doing him harm. For\r\nevery time his plough goes over it it tends to ram it down flat; every\r\ntime a man walks over it the result is the same; every horse that\r\npasses, everything that happens or has happened for centuries in that\r\nfield, tends to make that soil just below the reach of the ploughshare a\r\nhard, impervious mass, through which only the roots of the most strongly\r\ngrowing plants can find a way, and which tends to make the soil above\r\nit wet in wet weather and dry in dry weather. Thus roots have to spread\r\nsideways instead of downwards; or, growing downwards with difficulty,\r\neach plant has to expend vital energy in forcing its roots through the\r\nhard ground which it might better employ in producing flowers or fruits.\r\nAnd there is no natural storage of water. A shower drenches the ground.\r\nIn time it dries, through evaporation into the air, and then when the\r\ndrought comes all is arid as the Sahara.\r\n\r\nThat hard subsoil is known by the term \"hard-pan,\" and, as we have seen,\r\nit is produced more or less by all that goes on in the field. Even worse\r\nis the case--a very frequent one too--wherein there is a natural stratum\r\nof clay or equally dense waterproof material lying a few feet down.\r\n\r\nBeyond the reach of any plough, this hard stratum can be broken up by\r\nthe use of dynamite. The usual method is to drive holes in the ground\r\nabout fifteen to twenty feet apart and about three or four feet deep,\r\nright into the heart of the hard layer. At the bottom of each hole is\r\nplaced a cartridge of dynamite with a fuse and a detonator. This latter\r\nis a small tube containing a small quantity of explosive which, unlike\r\nthe dynamite, can be easily fired, and initiates the detonation of the\r\ncartridge.\r\n\r\nWhen these miniature earthquakes have taken place all over a field a\r\nvery different state of things prevails. The \"hard-pan\" has been broken.\r\nThe explosive used for such a purpose has a sudden shattering power,\r\nwhereby it pulverises the ground in its vicinity rather than making a\r\ngreat upheaval at the surface. The sudden shock makes cracks and\r\nfissures in all directions, through which roots can easily make their\r\nway. Moreover, it permits air to find an entrance, thereby aerating the\r\nsoil in such a way as to increase its fertility. The heat, or else the\r\nchemical products of the explosion, seem to destroy the fungus germs in\r\nthe ground. Finally a natural storage of water is set up. Heavy rain,\r\ninstead of drenching the upper soil, simply moistens it nicely, while\r\nthe surplus water descends into the newly disturbed layers, there to\r\nremain until the roots pump it up in time of drought.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that an acre of hay pumps up out of the soil 500 tons of\r\nwater per annum, so it is easy to see what an important feature this\r\nnatural water-storage is.\r\n\r\nFarmers say that their crops have doubled in value after thus dynamiting\r\nthe subsoil.\r\n\r\nThis operation has been spoken of as a substitute for ploughing, but\r\nthat may be put down to \"journalistic licence,\" for while it truly\r\nconveys the general idea, it is hardly correct. The ordinary plough\r\nturns over about eight inches, the special subsoil plough reaches down\r\nto about eighteen inches, but the dynamite method loosens the ground to\r\na depth of six or seven feet. Corn roots if given a chance will go\r\ndownwards from four to eight feet. Potatoes go down three feet, hops\r\neight to eighteen feet and vines twenty feet, so it is easy to see how\r\nrestricted the plants are when their natural rooting instincts are\r\nrestrained by a hard layer at a depth of eighteen inches or so.\r\n\r\nThe holes are made by means of a bar or drill. A great deal depends, of\r\ncourse, upon the hardness of the soil. Sometimes a steel bar has to be\r\ndriven in by a sledge-hammer. At others a pointed bar can be pushed down\r\nby hand. In some cases it will be found that the best tool to employ is\r\na \"dirt-auger,\" a tool like a carpenter's auger, which on being turned\r\nround and round bores its way into the earth. However it may be done,\r\none or more cartridges of dynamite are lowered into the finished hole,\r\none of them being fitted with the necessary detonator and fuse. Then a\r\nlittle loose earth or sand is dropped into the hole until it is filled\r\nto a depth of six inches or so above the uppermost cartridge. Above that\r\nit is quite safe to fill the hole with earth, ramming it in with a\r\nwooden rammer. This is called \"tamping,\" and it is necessary in order to\r\nprevent the force of the explosion being wasted in simply blowing up the\r\nhole. What is wanted is that the explosion shall take place within an\r\nenclosed chamber so that its effect may be felt equally in all\r\ndirections. The holes are generally about an inch and a half or an inch\r\nand three-quarters in diameter.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of firing the charges. One is by means of fuses. The\r\ndetonator is fastened to one cartridge and a length of fuse is attached\r\nto the detonator, which passing up the hole terminates above the ground.\r\nThe fuse is a tube of cotton filled with gunpowder, and it burns at the\r\nrate of about two feet a minute. Thus if three feet of fuse be used the\r\nman who lights it has a minute and a half in which to find a place of\r\nsafety from falling stones.\r\n\r\nThe other way is by electricity. In this case an electric fuse is\r\nattached to the cartridge and two wires are led up the hole. These are\r\nconnected to an electrical machine, which causes a current to pass down\r\ninto the fuse, where, by heating a fine platinum wire, it fires the\r\ndetonating material with which it is packed. This detonating material in\r\nturn fires the dynamite.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the electrical method is that twenty or thirty holes\r\nbeing simultaneously connected to the same machine can all be fired at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us think of another kind of farming, in which fruit trees\r\nare concerned. With a large tree the need of plenty of underground space\r\nfor its roots would seem to be more important even than in the case of\r\nannual plants like wheat. Yet we know very well that the usual procedure\r\nis to dig a small hole just about big enough to accommodate the roots of\r\nthe sapling when it is planted, while the ground all round is left\r\nundisturbed. The assumption is that the tree will, in time, be able to\r\npush its roots through anything which is not actually solid rock. So\r\nmuch is this the case that one authority has thought fit to warn\r\ntree-growers in this picturesque fashion. \"When planting a tree,\" he\r\nsays, \"forget what it is you are doing, and think that you are about to\r\nbury the biggest horse you know.\" How many people when planting any tree\r\ndig a hole big enough to bury a horse? It is fairly safe to reply, only\r\nthose who do it by dynamite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of Dupont Powder Co., Wilmington, Delaware_\r\n\r\n                     FIRST EFFECT OF THE DYNAMITE\r\n\r\n       Clearing a field of tree stumps by blowing them up with\r\n                        dynamite.--_See_ p. 16]\r\n\r\nThe method of working is to bore a hole nearly as deep as the hole you\r\nwant to blast. At the bottom place a powerful charge, far stronger than\r\nyou would use for \"subsoiling,\" as just described. That will not only\r\nblow a hole big enough for you to put your tree in, but it will loosen\r\nthe ground all around the hole for yards. The main debris from the hole\r\nwill fall back into it, but that will not matter much, since, being all\r\nloose, it is an easy matter to remove as much as is necessary to plant\r\nthe young tree. The advantages are the same as those enumerated in the\r\nprevious case--namely, the loosened ground gives more scope for the\r\nroots--apple-tree roots want twenty feet or so--the ground holds\r\nmoisture better, and the explosion kills the fungus germs. In addition\r\nto these there is the advantage that to blast a hole like this is\r\ncheaper than digging it.\r\n\r\nAnd that the advantages are not merely theoretical is shown by the fact\r\nthat trees so planted actually do grow stronger, bigger and quicker than\r\nprecisely similar ones under the same conditions, but set in the\r\nordinary way with a spade.\r\n\r\nAnd not only do new trees thus benefit; old trees can be helped by\r\ndynamite. Many an existing orchard has been improved by exploding\r\ndynamite at intervals between the rows of trees. Care has to be taken to\r\nsee that the disturbance is not so violent or so close as to damage the\r\ntrees, but that can be easily arranged, and then the result is that the\r\nsoil all around the trees is loosened, the roots are given more freedom\r\nand the water-storing properties of the ground are greatly improved.\r\n\r\nAgain, how often a farmer is troubled with a pond or a patch of marshy\r\nground right in the midst of his fields. It is of no use, and simply\r\nserves to make the field in which it occurs more difficult to plough and\r\nto cultivate--besides being so much good land wasted. Now the reason for\r\nthe existence of that pond or marsh is that underneath the surface there\r\nis an impervious layer in which, as in a basin, the water can collect.\r\nMake a hole in that and it will no more hold water than a cracked jug\r\nwill. And to make that hole with dynamite is the easiest thing in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIf the pond be merely a collection of water which occurs in wet weather,\r\nbut which dries up quickly, there simply needs to be drilled a deep hole\r\nand a fairly strong explosion caused at the bottom of it. How deep the\r\nhole must be depends upon the formation of the earth at that point, and\r\nhow low down is the stratum which, being waterproof, causes the water to\r\nremain. It is that, of course, which must be broken through, and so the\r\nexplosion must be caused at a point near the under side of that layer.\r\nWith a little experience the operator can judge the position by the feel\r\nof the tool with which he makes the hole. If the pond is permanent but\r\nshallow, men can wade to about the centre, there to drill a hole and\r\nfire a shot. If it be permanent and deep, then the work must be done\r\nfrom a raft, which, however, can be easily constructed for the purpose.\r\nOnce broken through, the water will quickly pass away below the\r\nimpervious stratum and useless land will become valuable.\r\n\r\nThe same may be done on a larger scale by blasting ditches with\r\ndynamite. This is in many cases much cheaper than digging them. A row of\r\nholes is put down, or even two or three rows, according to the width of\r\nthe proposed ditch. In depth they are made a little less than the depth\r\nof the ditch that is to be. And for a reason which will be apparent they\r\nare put very close together, say three feet or so apart. Preparations\r\nmay thus be made for blasting a ditch hundreds of feet long and then all\r\nare fired together. The earth is thrown up by a mighty upheaval, a ditch\r\nbeing produced of remarkable regularity considering the means by which\r\nit is made. The sides, of course, take a nice slope, the debris is\r\nthrown away on both sides and spread to a considerable distance, so\r\nthat, given favourable conditions and a well-arranged explosion, there\r\nis constructed a finished ditch which hardly needs touching with spade\r\nor other tool.\r\n\r\nIt not being feasible to fire a lot of holes electrically, the limit\r\nbeing about thirty, the simultaneous explosion of perhaps hundreds has\r\nto be brought about in some other manner, and usually it is accomplished\r\nby the simple device of putting the holes fairly near together and\r\nfiring one with a fuse. The commotion set up by this one causes the\r\nnearest ones to \"go off,\" they in turn detonating those farther on, with\r\nthe result that explosion follows explosion all along the line so\r\nrapidly as to be almost instantaneous.\r\n\r\nA farmer who is troubled by a winding stream passing through his land,\r\ncutting it up into awkward shapes, can straighten it by blasting a ditch\r\nacross a loop in the manner just described. In the case of low-lying\r\nland, however, ditches are obviously no use, since water would not flow\r\naway along them. In that case the principle suggested just now for\r\ndealing with an inconvenient pond can sometimes be used, for if the\r\nsubsoil be blasted through at several points it is very likely that\r\nwater will find a way downwards by some means or other.\r\n\r\nAnd the list of possible uses is by no means exhausted yet. A man\r\nopening up virgin land often finds old tree stumps his greatest bother.\r\nHe can dig round them and then pull them out with a team of horses, but\r\nby far the simpler way is with a few well-placed dynamite cartridges,\r\nfor they not only throw up the stump for him, but they break it up,\r\nshake the earth from it, and leave it ready for him to cart away or to\r\nburn.\r\n\r\nBoulders, too, can be blown to pieces far more easily than one would\r\nthink. The charges may be put underneath them as with the tree stumps,\r\nbut in many cases that is not necessary, all that is needed being some\r\ndynamite laid upon the top of the rock and covered with a heap of clay.\r\nSo sudden is the action of the explosive that its shock will break up\r\nthe stone underneath it. Yet another way, perhaps the most effective of\r\nall, is to drill a hole into the stone and fire a charge inside it. It\r\nbehoves the onlooker then to keep away, for the fragments may be thrown\r\nthree or four hundred feet, a fair proof that the stone will be very\r\nthoroughly demolished.\r\n\r\nEven in the digging of wells explosives may be useful. In that case the\r\nholes are made in a circle, and they slant downwards and inwards, so\r\nthat their lower ends tend to meet. The result of simultaneously\r\nexploding the charges in these holes is to cut out a conical hole a\r\nlittle larger in size than the ring and a little deeper than the point\r\nat which the explosion took place. The bottom of that hole can be\r\nlevelled a little and the operation repeated, and so stage by stage the\r\nwell will proceed to grow downwards.\r\n\r\nThe thought that naturally occurs to one is this. All the operations\r\ndescribed may be very well, the cost may be low, and the effect good,\r\nbut are they sufficient to compensate for the risks necessarily\r\ndependent upon the use of explosives? The doubt implied in that\r\nquestion, natural though it be, is based upon prejudice, with which we\r\nare all more or less afflicted. The art of making these explosive\r\nsubstances has been brought to such a pitch that with reasonable care\r\nthere is no risk whatever. The greatest possible care is used in the\r\nfactory to see that all explosives sent out are what they are meant to\r\nbe, and that they can therefore be relied upon to behave according to\r\nprogramme and not to play any tricks. That is the first step, and what\r\nwith competition between makers, Government inspection, and searching\r\ninquiry into the slightest accident, and the desire of each maker to\r\nkeep up the credit of his name, it is safe to say that modern explosives\r\nmay be relied upon to do their duty faithfully. The second step in the\r\nprocess of securing safety is that the powerful explosive, the one that\r\ndoes the work, is made very insensitive, so that it is really quite hard\r\nto explode it. With reasonable care, then, it will never go off by\r\naccident. On the other hand, the sensitive material, which is easy to\r\n\"let off,\" is in very small quantities, so small that an accident with\r\nit would not, again with reasonable precautions, be a serious matter.\r\n\r\nFuse, too, is very reliable nowadays. The man who lights the fuse may be\r\nabsolutely sure that he will have that time to get to a place of safety\r\nwhich corresponds to the length of fuse which he employs. With\r\nelectrical firing, too, it is quite easy to arrange that the final\r\nelectrical connection shall not be made until all are at a safe\r\ndistance, so that a premature explosion is impossible.\r\n\r\nIn many of the cases described, the shock takes place almost entirely\r\nwithin the earth and there is very little debris thrown about.\r\n\r\nIndeed the only danger which is to be feared with these operations is\r\nabout on a par with that which every farm hand runs from the kick of a\r\nhorse. Any careful, trustworthy man could be quite safely taught to do\r\nthis work, and with the assistance of a labourer he could do all that is\r\nnecessary. Given a fair amount of intelligence, too, he would take but\r\nlittle teaching. Altogether there is no doubt that the use of explosives\r\nis going to have a marked effect upon farming operations in the near\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMEASURING ELECTRICITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many people whose acquaintance with electricity consists\r\nmainly in paying the electric light bill. To such the instruments\r\nwhereby electricity is measured will make a specially interesting\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nCurrent is sold in Great Britain at so much per Board of Trade Unit. To\r\nstate what that is needs a preliminary explanation of the other units\r\nemployed in connection with electric currents.\r\n\r\nThe public electricity supply in any district is announced to be so many\r\nvolts, it may be 100, 200 or perhaps 230, but whatever it be, it is\r\nalways so many \"volts.\" Then the electrician speaks lightly of numbers\r\nof \"amperes,\" he may even talk of the number of \"watts\" used by the\r\nlamps, while occasionally the word \"ohm\" will leak out. Among these\r\nterms the general reader is apt to become completely fog-bound. But\r\nreally they are quite simple if once understood, and, as we shall see in\r\na moment, there are some very remarkable instruments for measuring them,\r\nsome of which exhibit a delicacy truly astonishing.\r\n\r\nIt is well at the outset to try and divest ourselves of the idea that\r\nthere is anything mysterious or occult about electricity. It is quite\r\ntrue that there are many things about it very little understood even by\r\nthe most learned, but for ordinary practical purposes it may be regarded\r\nas a fluid, which flows along a wire just as water flows along a pipe.\r\nThe wire is, electrically speaking, a \"hole\" through the air or other\r\nnon-conducting substance with which it is surrounded. A water-pipe being\r\na hole through a bar of iron, so the copper core of an electrical wire\r\nis, so far as the current is concerned, but a hole through the centre of\r\na tube of silk, cotton, rubber or whatever it be. Electricity can flow\r\nthrough certain solids just as water can flow through empty space.\r\n\r\nWater will not flow through a pipe unless a pressure be applied to it\r\nsomewhere. In a pipe the ends of which are at the same level water will\r\nlie inert and motionless. Lower one end, however, and the pressure\r\nproduced by gravity--in other words, the weight of the water--will cause\r\nit to move. In like manner pressure produced by the action of a pump\r\nwill make water flow. On the other hand, when it moves it encounters\r\nresistance, through the water rubbing against the walls of the pipe.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, an electrical pressure is necessary before a current of\r\nelectricity will flow. And every conductor offers more or less\r\nresistance to the flow of current, thus opposing the action of the\r\npressure. Before current will flow through your domestic glow-lamps and\r\ncause them to give light there must be a pressure at work, and that\r\npressure is described as so many volts.\r\n\r\nA battery is really a little automatic electrical pump for producing an\r\nelectrical pressure. And the volt, which is a legal measure, just as\r\nmuch as a pound or a yard, is a certain fraction of the pressure\r\nproduced by a certain battery known as Clark's Cell. It is not necessary\r\nhere to say exactly what that fraction is, but it will give a general\r\nidea to state that the ordinary Leclanche or dry cell, such as is used\r\nfor electric bells, produces a pressure of about one and a half volts.\r\n\r\nThus we see the volt is the electrical counterpart of the term \"pound\r\nper square inch\" which is used in the case of water pressure.\r\n\r\nA flow of water is measured in gallons per minute. An electrical current\r\nis measured in coulombs per second. Thus the coulomb is the electrical\r\ncounterpart of the gallon. But in this particular we differ slightly in\r\nour methods of talking of water and electricity. Gallons per minute or\r\nper hour is the invariable term in the former case, but in the latter\r\nwe do not speak of coulombs per second, although that is what we mean,\r\nfor we have a special name for one coulomb per second, and that same is\r\nampere. One ampere is one coulomb per second, two amperes are two\r\ncoulombs per second, and so on.\r\n\r\nThere is no recognised term to denote the resistance which a water-pipe\r\noffers to the passage of water through it, but in the similar case with\r\nelectricity there is a term specially invented for the purpose, the ohm.\r\nLegally it is the resistance of a column of mercury of a certain size\r\nand weight. A rough idea of it is given by the fact that a copper wire a\r\nsixteenth of an inch thick and 400 feet long has a resistance of about\r\none ohm.\r\n\r\nThe three units--the volt, ampere and ohm--are so related that a\r\npressure of one volt acting upon a circuit with a resistance of one ohm\r\nwill produce a current of one ampere.\r\n\r\nA current can do work; when it lights or heats your room or drives a\r\ntramcar it is doing work; and the rate at which a current does work is\r\nfound by multiplying together the number of volts and the number of\r\namperes. The result is in still another unit, the watt. And 1000 watts\r\nis a kilowatt. Finally, to crown the whole story, a kilowatt for one\r\nhour is a Board of Trade unit.\r\n\r\nSo for every unit which you pay for in the quarterly bill you have had a\r\ncurrent equal to 1000 watts for an hour. To give a concrete example, if\r\nthe pressure of your supply is 200 volts, and you take a current of five\r\namperes for an hour, you will have consumed one B.T.U.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will give added clearness to this explanation to tabulate the\r\nterms as follow:--\r\n\r\n     _Volt_ = The unit of pressure, analogous to \"pounds per square\r\n     inch\" in the case of water.\r\n\r\n     _Coulomb_ = The measure of quantity, analogous to the gallon.\r\n\r\n     _Ampere_ = The measure of the \"strength\" of a current, meaning one\r\n     coulomb per second.\r\n\r\n     _Watt_ = The unit denoting the power for work of any current. It is\r\n     the result of multiplying together volts and amperes.\r\n\r\n     _Kilowatt_ = 1000 watts.\r\n\r\n     _Board of Trade Unit_ = A current of one kilowatt flowing for one\r\n     hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:                  _By permission of Dupont Powder Co._\r\n\r\n                            A FINE CROP\r\n\r\n           Celery grown on soil tilled by dynamite.--_See_ p. 24]\r\n\r\nIn practice the measurements are generally made by means of the\r\nconnection between electricity and magnetism. A current of electricity\r\nis a magnet. Whenever a current is flowing it is surrounded by a region\r\nin which magnetism can be felt. This region is called the magnetic\r\nfield, and the strength of the field varies with the strength that is\r\nthe number of amperes in the current. If a wire carrying a current be\r\nwound up into a coil it is evident that the magnetic field will be more\r\nintense than if the wire be straight, for it will be concentrated into a\r\nsmaller area. Iron, with its peculiar magnetic properties, if placed in\r\na magnetic field seems to draw the magnetic forces towards itself, and\r\nconsequently, if the wire be wound round a core of iron, the magnetism\r\ndue to the current will be largely concentrated at the ends of the core.\r\nBut the main principle remains--in any given magnet the magnetic power\r\nexhibited will be in proportion to the current flowing.\r\n\r\nThe switchboard at a generating station is always supplied with\r\ninstruments called ammeters, an abbreviation of amperemeters, for the\r\npurpose of measuring the current passing out from the dynamos. Each of\r\nthese consists of a coil of wire through which the current passes. In\r\nsome there is a piece of iron near by, which is attracted more or less\r\nas the current varies, the iron being pulled back by a spring and its\r\nmovement against the tension of the spring being indicated by a pointer\r\non a dial.\r\n\r\nIn others the coil itself is free to swing in the neighbourhood of a\r\npowerful steel magnet, the interaction between the electro-magnet, or\r\ncoil, and the permanent magnet being such that they approach each other\r\nor recede from each other as the current varies. A pointer on a dial\r\nrecords the movements as before.\r\n\r\nIn yet another kind the permanent magnet gives way to a second coil, the\r\ncurrent passing through both in succession, the result being very much\r\nthe same, the two coils attracting each other more or less according to\r\nthe current.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of ammeter known as a thermo-ammeter works on quite a\r\ndifferent principle. It consists of a piece of fine platinum wire which\r\nis arranged as a \"shunt\"--that is to say, a certain small but definite\r\nproportion of the current to be measured passes through it. Now, being\r\nfine, the current has considerable difficulty in forcing its way through\r\nthis wire and the energy so expended becomes turned into heat in the\r\nwire. It is indeed a mild form of what we see in the filament of an\r\nincandescent lamp, where the energy expended in forcing the current\r\nthrough makes the filament white-hot. The same principle is at work when\r\nwe rub out a pencil mark with india-rubber, whereby the rubber becomes\r\nheated, as most of us have observed. The wire, then, is heated by the\r\ncurrent passing through it, and accordingly expands, the amount of\r\nexpansion forming an indication of the current passing. The elongation\r\nof the wire is made to turn a pointer.\r\n\r\nA simple modification makes any of these instruments into a voltmeter.\r\nThis instrument is intended to measure the force or pressure in the\r\ncurrent as it leaves the dynamo.\r\n\r\nA short branch circuit is constructed, leading from the positive wire\r\nnear the dynamo to the negative wire, or to the earth, where the\r\npressure is zero. In this circuit is placed the instrument, together\r\nwith a coil made of a very long length of fine wire so that it has a\r\nvery great resistance. Very little current will flow through the branch\r\ncircuit because of the high resistance of the coil, but what there is\r\nwill be in exact proportion to the pressure. The voltmeter is therefore\r\nthe same as the ammeter, except that its dial is marked for volts\r\ninstead of for amperes, and it has to be provided with the resistance\r\ncoil.\r\n\r\nInstruments of the ammeter type can also be used as ohmmeters. In this\r\ncase what is wanted is to test the resistance of a circuit, and it is\r\ndone by applying a battery, the voltage of which is known, and seeing\r\nhow much current flows.\r\n\r\nAll the voltmeters and ohmmeters mentioned owe their method of working\r\nto what is known as Ohm's law. One of the greatest steps in the\r\ndevelopment of electrical science was taken when Dr Ohm put forward the\r\nlaw which he had discovered whereby pressure, current and resistance are\r\nrelated. The reader will probably have noticed from what has already\r\nbeen said about the units of measurement--the volt, the ampere and the\r\nohm--that the current varies directly as the pressure and inversely as\r\nthe resistance. That is the famous and important \"Ohm's law\" and anyone\r\nwho has once grasped that has gone a long way towards understanding many\r\nof the principal phenomena of electric currents.\r\n\r\nBut the instruments so far referred to are of the big, clumsy type,\r\nsuitable for measuring large currents and great pressures. They are like\r\nthe great railway weigh-bridges, which weigh a whole truck-load at a\r\ntime and are good enough if they are true to a quarter of a\r\nhundredweight. The instruments about to be described are more comparable\r\nwith the delicate balance of the chemist, which can detect the added\r\nweight when a pencil mark is made upon a piece of paper. Indeed beside\r\nthem such a balance is quite crude and clumsy. They may be said to be\r\nthe most delicate measuring instruments in existence.\r\n\r\nWe will commence with the galvanometer. The simplest form of this is a\r\nneedle like that of a mariner's compass very delicately suspended by a\r\nthin fibre in the neighbourhood of a coil of wire. The magnetic field\r\nproduced by the current flowing in the wire tends to turn the needle,\r\nwhich movement is resisted by its natural tendency to point north and\r\nsouth. Thus the current only turns the needle a certain distance, which\r\ndistance will be in proportion to its strength. The deflection of the\r\nneedle, therefore, gives us a measure of the strength of the current.\r\n\r\nBut such an instrument is not delicate enough for the most refined\r\nexperiments, and the improved form generally used is due to that prince\r\nof inventors, the late Lord Kelvin. He originally devised it, it is\r\ninteresting to note, not for laboratory experiments, but for practical\r\nuse as a telegraph instrument in connection with the early Atlantic\r\ncables.\r\n\r\nBefore describing it, it may sharpen the reader's interest to mention a\r\nwonderful experiment which was made by Varley, the famous electrician,\r\non the first successful Atlantic cable. He formed a minute battery of a\r\nbrass gun-cap, with a scrap of zinc and a single drop of acidulated\r\nwater. This he connected up to the cable. Probably there is not one\r\nreader of this book but would have thought, if he had been present, that\r\nthe man was mad. What conceivable good could come of connecting such a\r\nfeeble source of electrical pressure to the two thousand miles of wire\r\nspanning the great ocean; the very idea seems fantastic in the extreme.\r\nYet that tiny battery was able to make its power felt even over that\r\ngreat distance, for the Thomson Mirror Galvanometer was there to detect\r\nit. Two thousand miles away, the galvanometer felt and was operated by\r\nthe force generated in a battery about the size of one of the capital\r\nletters on this page.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful instrument consisted of a magnet made of a small fragment\r\nof watch-spring, suspended in a horizontal position by means of a thread\r\nof fine silk, close to a coil of fine wire. When current flowed through\r\nthe coil the magnetic field caused the watch-spring magnet to swing\r\nround, but when the current ceased the untwisting of the silk brought it\r\nback to its original position again.\r\n\r\nSo far it seems to differ very little from the ordinary galvanometer\r\npreviously mentioned, but the stroke of genius was in the method of\r\nreading it. With a small current the movement of the magnet was too\r\nsmall to be observed by the unaided eye, so it was attached to a minute\r\nmirror made of one of those little circles of glass used for covering\r\nmicroscope slides, silvered on the back. The magnet was cemented to the\r\nback of this, yet both were so small that together their weight was\r\nsupported by a single thread of cocoon silk. Light from a lamp was made\r\nto fall upon this mirror, thereby throwing a spot of light upon a\r\ndistant screen. Thus the slightest movement of the magnet was magnified\r\ninto a considerable movement of the spot of light. The beam of light\r\nfrom the mirror to the screen became, in fact, a long lever or pointer,\r\nwithout weight and without friction.\r\n\r\nThe task of watching the rocking to and fro of the spot of light was\r\nfound to be too nerve-racking for the telegraph operators, and so Lord\r\nKelvin improved upon his galvanometer in two ways. He first of all\r\nmanaged to give it greater turning-power, so that, actuated by the same\r\ncurrent, the new instrument would work much more strongly than the older\r\none. Then he utilised this added power to move a pen whereby the signals\r\nwere recorded automatically upon a piece of paper. The new instrument is\r\nknown as the Siphon Recorder.\r\n\r\nThe added power was obtained by turning the instrument inside out, as it\r\nwere, making the coil the moving part and the permanent magnet the fixed\r\npart. This enabled him to employ a very powerful permanent magnet in\r\nplace of the minute one made of watch-spring. The interaction of two\r\nmagnets is the result of their combined strength, and that of the coil\r\nbeing limited by the strength of the minute current the only way to\r\nincrease the combined power of the two was to substitute a large\r\npowerful magnet for the small magnetised watch-spring. This large magnet\r\nwould, of course, have been too heavy to swing easily and therefore the\r\npositions had to be reversed.\r\n\r\nSo now we have two types of galvanometer, both due originally to the\r\ninventions of Lord Kelvin. For some purposes the Thomson type (his name\r\nwas Thomson before he became Lord Kelvin) are still used, but in a\r\nslightly elaborated form. Its sensitiveness is such that a current of a\r\nthousandth of a micro-ampere will move the spot of light appreciably.\r\nAnd when one comes to consider that a micro-ampere is a millionth part\r\nof an ampere this is perfectly astounding.\r\n\r\nBut there is a more wonderful story still to come, of an instrument\r\nwhich can detect a millionth of a micro-ampere, or one millionth of a\r\nmillionth of an ampere. It is not generally known that we are all\r\npossessors of an electric generator in the form of the human heart, but\r\nit is so, and Professor Einthoven, of Leyden, wishing to investigate\r\nthese currents from the heart, found himself in need of a galvanometer\r\nexceeding in sensitiveness anything then known. Even the tiny needles or\r\ncoils with their minute mirrors have some weight and so possess in an\r\nappreciable degree the property of inertia, in virtue of which they are\r\nloath to start movement and, having started, are reluctant to stop. This\r\ninertia, it is easy to see, militates against the accurate recording of\r\nrapid variations in minute currents, so the energetic Professor set\r\nabout devising a new galvanometer which should answer his purpose. This\r\nis known as the \"String Galvanometer.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.-This shows the principle of this wonderful\r\nGalvanometer invented by Lord Kelvin in its latest form. Current enters\r\nat _a_, passes round the coils, as shown by the arrows, and away at _b_.\r\nA light rod, _c_, is suspended by the fine fibre, _d_, so that the eight\r\nlittle magnets hang in the centres of the coils--four in each. The\r\ncurrent deflects these magnets and so turns the mirror, _m_, at the\r\nbottom of the rod. At _e_ are two large magnets which give the little\r\nones the necessary tendency to keep at \"zero.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Here we see the working parts of the \"String\r\nGalvanometer,\" by which the beating of the heart can be registered\r\nelectrically. The current flows down the fine silvered fibre, between\r\nthe poles, _a_ and _b_, of a powerful magnet. As the current varies, the\r\nfibre bends more or less.]\r\n\r\nThe main body of the instrument is a large, powerful electro-magnet, in\r\nshape like a large pair of jaws nearly shut. Energised by a strong\r\ncurrent, this magnet produces an exceedingly strong magnetic field in\r\nthe small space between the \"teeth\" as it were. In this space there is\r\nstretched a fine thread of quartz which is almost perfectly elastic. It\r\nis a non-conductor, however, so it is covered with a fine coating of\r\nsilver. Silver wire is sometimes used, but no way has yet been found of\r\ndrawing any metallic wire so thin as the quartz fibre, which is\r\nsometimes as thin as two thousandths of a millimetre, or about a\r\ntwelve-thousandth of an inch. A hundred pages of this book make up a\r\nthickness of about an inch, so that one leaf is about a fiftieth of an\r\ninch. Consequently the fibre in question could be multiplied 240 times\r\nbefore it became as stout as the paper on which these words are printed.\r\n\r\nThe current to be measured, then, is passed through the stretched fibre\r\nand the interaction of the magnetic field by which the fibre is then\r\nsurrounded, with the magnetic field in which it is immersed, causes it\r\nto be deflected to one side. Of course the deflection is exceedingly\r\nsmall in amount, and as it is undesirable to hamper its movements by the\r\nweight of a mirror, no matter how small, some other means of reading the\r\ninstrument had to be devised. This is a microscope which is fixed to one\r\nof the jaws, through a fine hole in which the movements of the fibre can\r\nbe viewed. Or what is often better still, a picture of the wire can be\r\nprojected through the microscope on to a screen or on to a moving\r\nphotographic plate or strip of photographic paper. In the latter case a\r\npermanent record is made of the changes in the flowing current.\r\n\r\nAn electric picture can thus be made of the working of a man's heart. He\r\nholds in his hands two metal handles or is in some other way connected\r\nto the two ends of the fibre by wires just as the handles of a shocking\r\ncoil are connected to the ends of the coil. The faint currents caused by\r\nthe beating of his heart are thus set down in the form of a wavy line.\r\nSuch a diagram is called a \"cardiogram,\" and it seems that each of us\r\nhas a particular form of cardiogram peculiar to himself, so that a man\r\ncould almost be recognised and distinguished from his fellows by the\r\nelectrical action of his heart.\r\n\r\nThe galvanometer has a near relative, the electrometer, the astounding\r\ndelicacy of which renders it equally interesting. It is particularly\r\nvaluable in certain important investigations as to the nature and\r\nconstruction of atoms.\r\n\r\nThe galvanometer, it will be remembered, measures minute currents; the\r\nelectrometer measures minute pressures, particularly those of small\r\nelectrically charged bodies.\r\n\r\nEvery conductor (and all things are conductors, more or less) can be\r\ngiven a charge of electricity. Any insulated wire, for example, if\r\nconnected to a battery will become charged--current will flow into it\r\nand there remain stationary. And that is what we mean by a charge as\r\nopposed to a current.\r\n\r\nAir compressed into a closed vessel is a charge. Air, however\r\ncompressed, flowing along a pipe would be better described as a current.\r\n\r\nImagine one of those cylinders used for the conveyance of gas under\r\npressure and suppose that we desire to find the pressure of the gas with\r\nwhich it is charged. We connect a pressure-gauge to it, and see what the\r\nfinger of the gauge has to say. What happens is that gas from the\r\ncylinder flows into the little vessel which constitutes the gauge and\r\nthere records its own pressure.\r\n\r\nAnd just the same applies with electrometers. Precisely as the\r\npressure-gauge measures the pressure of air or gas in some vessel, so\r\nthe electrometer measures the electrical pressure in a charged body.\r\n\r\nFurther, some of the charged bodies with which the student of physics is\r\nmuch concerned are far smaller than can be seen with the most powerful\r\nmicroscope. How wonderfully minute and delicate, therefore, must be the\r\ninstrument which can be influenced by the tiny charge which so small a\r\nbody can carry.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting here to describe an experiment performed with an\r\nelectrometer by Professor Rutherford, by which he determined how many\r\nmolecules there are in a centimetre of gas, a number very important to\r\nknow but very difficult to ascertain, since molecules are too small to\r\nbe seen. This number, by the way, is known to science as \"Avogadro's\r\nConstant.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone has heard of radium, and knows that it is in a state which can\r\nbest be described as a long-drawn-out explosion. It is always shooting\r\noff tiny particles. Night and day, year in and year out, it is firing\r\noff these exceedingly minute projectiles, of which there are two kinds,\r\none of which appears to be atoms of helium.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, when radium was being much talked about and the names of\r\nM. and Madame Curie were in everyone's mouth, little toys were sold, the\r\ninvention, I believe, of Sir William Crookes, called spinthariscopes.\r\nEach of these consisted of a short brass tube with a small lens in one\r\nend. Looking through the lens in a dark room, one could see little\r\nsplashes of light on the walls of the tube. Those splashes were caused\r\nby a tiny speck of radium in the middle of the tube, the helium atoms\r\nfrom which, by bombarding the inner surface of the tube, produced the\r\nsparks.\r\n\r\nNow if we can count those splashes we can tell how many atoms of helium\r\nare being given off per minute. And if then we reckon how many minutes\r\nit takes to accumulate a cubic centimetre of helium we can easily reckon\r\nhow many atoms go to the cubic centimetre. But the difficulty is to\r\ncount them.\r\n\r\nSo the learned Professor called in the aid of the electrometer. He could\r\nnot count all the atoms shot off, so he put the piece of radium at one\r\nend of a tube and an electrometer at the other. Every now and then an\r\natom shot right through the tube and out at the farther end. And since\r\neach of these atoms from radium is charged with electricity, each as it\r\nemerged operated the electrometer. By simply watching the twitching of\r\nthe instrument, therefore, it was possible to count how many atoms shot\r\nthrough the tube--one atom one twitch. And from the size and position of\r\nthe tube it was possible to reckon what proportion of the whole number\r\nshot off would pass that way.\r\n\r\nThe result of the experiment showed that there are in a cubic centimetre\r\nof helium a number of atoms represented by 256 followed by seventeen\r\nnoughts. And as helium is one of the few substances in which the\r\nmolecule is formed of but one atom, that is also the number of\r\nmolecules.\r\n\r\nAnd now consider this, please. A cubic centimetre is about the size of a\r\nboy's marble. That contains the vast number of molecules just mentioned.\r\nAnd the electrometer was able to detect the presence of those _one at a\r\ntime_. Need one add another word as to the inconceivable delicacy of the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nIn its simplest form the electrometer is called the \"electroscope.\" Two\r\nstrips of gold-leaf are suspended by their ends under a glass or metal\r\nshade. As they hang normally they are in close proximity. Their upper\r\nends are, in fact, in contact and are attached to a small vertical\r\nconductor. A charge imparted to the small conductor will pass down into\r\nthe leaves, and since it will charge them both they will repel each\r\nother so that their lower ends will swing apart. Such an instrument is\r\nvery delicate, but because of the extreme thinness of the leaves it is\r\nvery difficult to read accurately the amount of their movement and so to\r\ndetermine the charge which has been given to them.\r\n\r\nIn a more recent improvement, therefore, only one strip of gold-leaf is\r\nused, the place of the other being taken by a copper strip. The whole of\r\nthe movement is thus in the single gold-leaf, as the copper strip is\r\ncomparatively stiff, and it is possible to arrange for the movement of\r\nthis one piece of gold-leaf to be measured by a microscope.\r\n\r\nThe other principal kind of electrometer we owe, as we do the\r\ngalvanometers, to the wonderful ingenuity of Lord Kelvin. In this the\r\nmoving part is a strip of thin aluminium, which is suspended in a\r\nhorizontal position by means, generally, of a fine quartz fibre. Since\r\nit is necessary that this fibre should be a conductor, which quartz is\r\nnot, it is electro-plated with silver. Thus a charge communicated to the\r\nupper end of the fibre, where it is attached to the case, passes down to\r\nthe aluminium \"needle,\" as it is called. Now the needle is free to swing\r\nto and fro, with a rotating motion, between two metal plates carefully\r\ninsulated. Each plate is cut into four quadrants, the opposite ones\r\nbeing electrically connected, while all are insulated from their nearest\r\nneighbours. One set of quadrants is charged positively, and one set\r\nnegatively, by a battery, but these charges have no effect upon the\r\nneedle until it is itself charged. As soon as that occurs, however, they\r\npull it round, and the amount of its movement indicates the amount of\r\nthe charge upon the needle, and therefore the pressure existing upon the\r\ncharged body to which it is connected. The direction of its movement\r\nshows, moreover, whether the charge be positive or negative.\r\n\r\nA little mirror is attached to the needle, so that its slightest motion\r\nis revealed by the movement of a spot of light, as in the case of the\r\nmirror galvanometers. Instruments such as these are called \"Quadrant\r\nElectrometers.\"\r\n\r\nMy readers will remember, too, the \"String Galvanometer\" already\r\nmentioned. The same idea has been adapted to this purpose. A fine fibre\r\nis stretched between two charged conductors while the fibre is itself\r\nconnected to the body whose charge is being measured. The charge which\r\nit derives from the body causes it to be deflected, which deflection is\r\nmeasured by a microscope.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of transmission of electricity over long distances for\r\nlighting or power purposes the currents are \"alternating.\" They flow\r\nfirst one way and then the other, reversing perhaps twenty times a\r\nsecond, or it may be two hundred, or even more times in that short\r\nperiod. Some electric railways are worked with alternating current, and\r\nit is used for lighting quite as much as direct current and is equally\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn wireless telegraphy it is essential. In that case, however, the\r\nreversals may take place _millions_ of times per second. Consequently,\r\nto distinguish the comparatively slowly changing currents of a\r\n\"frequency\" or \"periodicity\" of a few hundreds per second from these\r\nmuch more rapid ones, the latter are more often spoken of as electrical\r\noscillations. And these alternating and oscillating currents need to be\r\nmeasured just as the direct currents do. Yet in many cases the same\r\ninstruments will not answer. There has therefore grown up a class of\r\nwonderful measuring instruments specially designed for this purpose, by\r\nwhich not only does the station engineer know what his alternating\r\ncurrent dynamos are doing, but the wireless operator can tell what is\r\nhappening in his apparatus, the investigator can probe the subtleties of\r\nthe currents which he is working with, and apparatus for all purposes\r\ncan be designed and worked with a system and reason which would be\r\nimpossible but for the possibility of being able to measure the\r\nbehaviour of the subtle current under all conditions.\r\n\r\nOne trouble in connection with measuring these alternating currents is\r\nthat they are very reluctant to pass through a coil.\r\n\r\nOne method by which this difficulty can be overcome has been mentioned\r\nincidentally already. I refer to the heating of a wire through which\r\ncurrent is passing. This is just the same whether the current be\r\nalternating or direct.\r\n\r\nOne of the simplest instruments of this class has been appropriated by\r\nthe Germans, who have named it the \"Reiss Electrical Thermometer,\"\r\nalthough it was really invented nearly a century ago by Sir William Snow\r\nHarris. It consists of a glass bulb on one end of a glass tube. The\r\ncurrent is passed through a fine wire inside this bulb, and as the wire\r\nbecomes heated it expands the air inside the bulb. This expansion moves\r\na little globule of mercury which lies in the tube, and which forms the\r\npointer or indicator by which the instrument is read. As the temperature\r\nof the wire rises the mercury is forced away from the bulb, as the\r\ntemperature falls it returns. And as the temperature is varied by the\r\npassage of the current, so the movement of the mercury is a measure of\r\nthe current.\r\n\r\nAnother way is to employ a \"Rectifier.\" This is a conductor which has\r\nthe peculiar property of allowing current to pass one way but not the\r\nother. It thus eliminates every alternate current and changes the\r\nalternating current into a series of intermittent currents all in the\r\nsame direction. Rectified current is thus hardly described by the term\r\ncontinuous, but still it is \"continuous current\" in the sense that the\r\nflow is always in the same direction, and so it can be measured by the\r\nordinary continuous current instruments. The difficulty about it is that\r\nthere is some doubt as to the relation between the quantity of rectified\r\ncurrent which the galvanometer registers and the quantity of alternating\r\ncurrent, which after all is the quantity which is really to be measured.\r\nHow the rectification is accomplished will be referred to again in the\r\nchapter on Wireless Telegraphy.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the thermo-galvanometers, as those are termed which\r\nascertain the strength of a current by the heat which it produces, the\r\nsimple little contrivance of Sir William Snow Harris has more elaborate\r\nsuccessors, of which perhaps the most interesting are those associated\r\nwith the name of Mr W. Duddell, who has made the subject largely his\r\nown. Besides their interest as wonderfully delicate measuring\r\ninstruments, these have an added interest, since they introduce us to\r\nanother strange phenomenon in electricity. We have just noted the fact\r\nthat electricity causes heat. Now we shall see the exact opposite, in\r\nwhich heat produces electrical pressure and current. And the feature of\r\nMr Duddell's instruments is the way in which these two things are\r\ncombined. By a roundabout but very effective way he rectifies the\r\ncurrent to be measured, for he first converts some of the alternating\r\ncurrent into heat and then converts that heat into continuous current.\r\n\r\nIf two pieces of dissimilar metals be connected together by their ends,\r\nso as to form a circuit, and one of the joints be heated, an electrical\r\npressure will be generated which will cause a current to flow round the\r\ncircuit. The direction in which it will flow will depend upon the metals\r\nemployed. The amount of the pressure will also depend upon the metals\r\nused, combined with the temperature of the junctions. With any given\r\npair of metals, however, the force, and therefore the volume of current,\r\nwill vary as the temperature. Really it will be the difference in\r\ntemperature between the hot junction and the cold junction, but if we so\r\narrange things that the cold junction shall always remain about the\r\nsame, the current which flows will vary as the temperature of the hot\r\none. The volume of that current will therefore be a measure of the\r\ntemperature. Such an arrangement is known as a thermo-couple, and is\r\nbecoming of great use in many manufacturing processes as a means of\r\nmeasuring temperatures.\r\n\r\nIn the Duddell Thermo-galvanometers, therefore, the alternating current\r\nis first led to a \"heater\" consisting of fine platinised quartz fibre or\r\nthin metal wires. Just above the heater there hangs a thermo-couple,\r\nconsisting of two little bars, one of bismuth and the other of antimony.\r\nThese two are connected together at their lower end, where they nearly\r\ntouch the heater, but their upper ends are kept a little apart, being\r\njoined, however, by a loop formed of silver strip. This arrangement will\r\nbe quite clear from the accompanying sketch, and it will be observed\r\nthat the loop is so shaped that the whole thing can be easily suspended\r\nby a delicate fibre which will permit it to swing easily, like the coil\r\nin a mirror galvanometer.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a swinging coil of a galvanometer formed with a single turn\r\ninstead of the many turns usual in the ordinary instruments, and it will\r\nbe noticed from the sketch that there is a mirror fixed just above the\r\ntop of the loop.\r\n\r\nThis coil, then, with the thermo-couple at its lower extremity, is hung\r\nbetween the ends of a powerful magnet much as the fibre of the Einthoven\r\nGalvanometer is situated. The alternating current to be measured comes\r\nalong through the heater. The heater rises in temperature. That warms\r\nthe lower end of the thermo-couple. Instantly a steady, continuous\r\ncurrent begins to circulate round the silver strip which forms the coil,\r\nand that, acting just as the current does in the ordinary galvanometer,\r\ncauses the coil to swing round more or less, which movement is indicated\r\nby the spot of light from the mirror. A current as small as twenty\r\nmicro-amperes (or twenty millionths of an ampere) can be measured in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\nMr Duddell has also perfected a wonderful instrument called an\r\nOscillograph, for the strange purpose of making actual pictures of the\r\nrise and fall in volume of current in alternating circuits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--The \"Duddell\" Thermo-galvanometer.\r\n\r\nIn this remarkable instrument _alternating_ current enters at _a_,\r\npasses through the fine wire and leaves at _b_. In doing this it heats\r\nthe wire, which in turn heats the lower end of the bismuth and antimony\r\nbars. This generates _continuous_ current, which circulates through the\r\nloop of silver wire, _c_, which, since it hangs between the poles, _d_\r\nand _e_, of a magnet, is thereby turned more or less. The amount of the\r\nturning indicates the strength of the _alternating_ current.]\r\n\r\nTo realise the almost miraculous delicacy of these wonderful instruments\r\nwe need first of all to construct a mental picture of what takes place\r\nin a circuit through which alternating current is passing. The current\r\nbegins to flow: it gradually increases in volume until it reaches its\r\nmaximum: then it begins to die away until it becomes nil: then it begins\r\nto grow in the opposite direction, increases to its maximum and dies\r\naway once more. That cycle of events occurs over and over again at the\r\nrate it may be of hundreds of times per second. Now for the actual\r\nefficient operation of electrical machinery working on alternating\r\ncurrent it is very necessary to know exactly how those changes take\r\nplace--do they occur gradually, the current growing and increasing in\r\nvolume regularly and steadily, or irregularly in a jumpy manner?\r\nEngineers have a great fancy for setting out such changes in the form of\r\ndiagrams, in which case the alternations are represented by a wavy line,\r\nand it is of much importance to obtain an actual diagram showing not\r\nwhat the changes should be according to theory, but what they really are\r\nin practice. It is then possible to see whether the \"wave-form\" of the\r\ncurrent is what it ought to be.\r\n\r\nOnce again we must turn our thoughts back to the string galvanometer. In\r\nthat case, it will be remembered, there is a conducting fibre passing\r\nbetween the ends or poles of a powerful magnet, the result of which\r\narrangement is that as the current passes through the fibre it is bent\r\nby the action of the magnetic forces produced around it. If the current\r\npass one way, downwards let us say, the fibre will be bent one way,\r\nwhile if it pass upwards it will be bent the opposite way. Suppose then\r\nthat we have two fibres instead of one, and that we send the current up\r\none and down the other. One will be bent inwards and the other outwards.\r\nThen suppose that we fix a little mirror to the centre of the fibres,\r\none side of it being attached to one fibre and the other to the other.\r\nAs one fibre advances and the other recedes the mirror will be turned\r\nmore or less. Consequently, as the current flowing in the fibres\r\nincreases or decreases, or changes in direction, the mirror will be\r\nslewed round more or less in one direction or the other.\r\n\r\nThe spot of light thrown by the mirror will then dance from side to side\r\nwith every variation, and if it be made to fall upon a rapidly moving\r\nstrip of photograph paper a wavy line will be drawn upon the paper which\r\nwill faithfully represent the changes in the current.\r\n\r\nIn its action, of course, it is not unlike an ordinary mirror\r\ngalvanometer, but its special feature is in the mechanical arrangement\r\nof its parts which enable it to move with sufficient rapidity to follow\r\nthe rapidly succeeding changes which need to be investigated. It is far\r\nless sensitive than, say, a Thomson Galvanometer, but the latter could\r\nnot respond quickly enough for this particular purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FUEL OF THE FUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now enter for a while the realm of organic chemistry, a branch of\r\nknowledge which is of supreme interest, since it covers the matters of\r\nwhich our own bodies are constructed, the foods which we eat and the\r\nbeverages which we drink, besides a host of other things of great value\r\nto us.\r\n\r\nAlthough the old division of chemistry into inorganic and organic is\r\nstill kept up as a matter of convenience, the old boundaries between the\r\ntwo have become largely obliterated. The distinction arose from the fact\r\nthat there used to be (and are still to a very great extent) a number of\r\nhighly complex substances the composition of which is known, for they\r\ncan be analysed, or taken to pieces, but which the wit of man has failed\r\nto put together. Consequently these substances could only be obtained\r\nfrom organic bodies. The living trees, or animals, could in some\r\nmysterious way bring these combinations about, but man could not. The\r\nmolecules of these substances are much more complicated than those with\r\nwhich the inorganic chemist deals. The important ingredient in them all\r\nis carbon, which with hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen almost completes the\r\nlist of the simple elements of which these marvellous substances are\r\ncompounded. In some cases there appear to be hundreds of atoms in the\r\nmolecule.\r\n\r\nIf one takes a glance at a text-book on organic chemistry the pages are\r\nseen to be sprinkled all over with C's and O's, N's and H's, with but an\r\noccasional symbol for some other element.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of this branch which cannot fail to strike the casual\r\nobserver is the queer names which many of the substances possess.\r\nTrimethylaniline, triphenylmethane and mononitrophenol are a few\r\nexamples which happen to occur to the memory, and they are by no means\r\nthe longest or queerest-sounding.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity about these organic substances is that a number of\r\nthem, each quite different from the others, can be formed of the same\r\natoms. Certain atoms of hydrogen, sulphur and oxygen form sulphuric\r\nacid, and under whatever conditions they combine they never form\r\nanything else. On the other hand, there are sixty-six different\r\nsubstances all formed of eight of carbon, twelve of hydrogen and four of\r\noxygen. This can only mean that in such cases as the latter the atoms\r\nhave different groupings and that when grouped in one way they form one\r\nthing, in another way some other thing, and so on. This explains the\r\nextreme difficulty which the chemist finds in building up some of these\r\norganic substances.\r\n\r\nEvery now and again we are startled by some eminent man stating that the\r\ntime will come when we shall be able to make living things, when the\r\nlaboratory will turn out living cows and sheep, birds and insects, even\r\nman with a mind and soul of his own. Yet one cannot but feel that such\r\nmen, no matter how great their authority, are simply \"pulling the\r\npublic's leg,\" to use a colloquial expression. For they hopelessly fail\r\nto make many of the commonest things. In many cases where they wish to\r\nproduce an organic substance they have to call in the aid of some living\r\nthing to do it for them, even if it be but a humble microbe. For the\r\nmicrobes perform wonderful feats in chemistry, far surpassing those of\r\nthe most eminent men. Hence the latter very sensibly use the microbe,\r\nemploy it to work for them, just set things in order and then stand by\r\nwhile the microbe does the work.\r\n\r\nThus most things can be analysed--that is to say, taken to pieces--while\r\nmany things can now be synthesised--that is to say, built up from their\r\nconstituent atoms--but still a great many remain, and among them the\r\nmost important, the synthesis of which completely baffles man. One of\r\nthe most useful and widespread substances, for example, cellulose, is,\r\nat present at least, utterly beyond us. We do not even know how many\r\natoms there are in the cellulose molecule. The molecules may, for all we\r\nknow, contain thousands of atoms. Indeed many of these organic matters\r\nhave very large molecules.\r\n\r\nAnd even if the chemist were able to make all kinds of organic matter,\r\nhe would still be as far off as ever from making _living_ matter. Indigo\r\nused to be derived entirely from plants of that name. One of the\r\ngreatest triumphs of the organic chemist was when he produced artificial\r\nor synthetic indigo. But he is as far off as ever from making the indigo\r\nplant. It is claimed that \"synthetic\" rubber is exactly the same as\r\nnatural rubber, although some users say it is not quite the same. Still,\r\nif it be so, it is dead rubber, not the living part of the plant. The\r\ntime, then, is infinitely far distant when the chemist will be able to\r\nmake anything with the characteristics of life--namely, to grow by\r\naccretion from within and to reproduce its kind. The most wonderful\r\nproduct of the laboratory is dead. At most it simply resembles something\r\nwhich _once_ was alive.\r\n\r\nBut that is somewhat of a digression. This dissertation on organic\r\nchemistry was simply intended to lead up to the question of liquid\r\nfuels, all of which are organic.\r\n\r\nIn the life of to-day one of the most important things is petroleum.\r\nThis is a kind of liquid coal. Just how it was formed down in the depths\r\nof the earth is not clear. One idea is that it is due to the\r\ndecomposition of animal and vegetable matter. Another is that certain\r\nvolcanic rocks which are known to contain carbide of iron might, under\r\nthe influence of steam, have in bygone ages given off petroleum, or\r\nparaffin, to use the other name for the same thing.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the world these deposits of oil are obtained by sinking\r\nwells and pumping up the oil. In others the liquid gushes out without\r\nthe necessity of pumping at all. This is believed to be due to the fact\r\nthat water pressure is at work. Artesian wells, from which the water\r\nrushes of its own accord, are quite familiar, and are due to the fact\r\nthat some underground reservoir tapped by the well is fed through\r\nnatural pipes, really fissures in the rock, from some point higher than\r\nthe mouth of the well. Now supposing that a reservoir of oil were also\r\nin communication with the upper world in the same way, the descending\r\nwater would go to the bottom, underneath the lighter oil, and would thus\r\nlift it up, so that on being tapped the oil would rush out.\r\n\r\nAnother source of mineral oil is shale, such as is to be found in vast\r\ndeposits in the south-east of Scotland. This shale is mined much as coal\r\nis: it is then heated in retorts as coal is heated at the gas-works: and\r\nthe vapour which is given off, on being condensed, forms a liquid like\r\ncrude petroleum.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases the original oil is a mixture of a great number of\r\ngrades differing from each other in various ways. They are all\r\n\"hydro-carbons,\" which means compounds of carbon and hydrogen, and they\r\nextend from cymogene (the molecules of which contain four atoms of\r\ncarbon and ten of hydrogen) to paraffin wax, which has somewhere about\r\nthirty-two of carbon to sixty-six of hydrogen. For practical purposes\r\ntheir most important difference is the temperature at which they boil,\r\nor turn quickly into vapour.\r\n\r\nThis forms the means by which they are sorted out. In a huge still, like\r\na steam-boiler, the crude or mixed oil is gradually heated, and the gas\r\ngiven off is led to a cooling vessel where it is chilled back into\r\nliquid. The lightest of all, cymogene, is given off even at the\r\nfreezing-point of water. That is led into one chamber and condensed\r\nthere. Then, as the temperature rises to 18 deg. C., rhigolene is given off:\r\nthat is collected and condensed in another vessel. Between 70 deg. and 120 deg.\r\npetroleum ether and petroleum naphtha are produced, and they together\r\nconstitute what is commonly called petrol. Between 120 deg. and 150 deg.\r\npetroleum benzine arises. All the foregoing taken together constitute\r\nabout 8 to 10 per cent. of the whole crude oil. Then between 150 deg. and\r\n300 deg. there comes off the great bulk of the oil, nearly 80 per cent., the\r\nkerosene or paraffin which we burn in lamps. Above 300 deg. there is\r\nobtained another oil, which is used for lubrication, also the invaluable\r\nvaseline, and finally, when the still is allowed to cool, there remains\r\na solid residuum known as paraffin wax. This process is known as\r\nfractional distillation, and it will be noticed that it consists\r\nessentially in collecting and liquefying separately those vapours which\r\nare given off at different ranges of temperature. For our purpose in\r\nthis chapter we are mainly concerned with the petrol and the kerosene.\r\n\r\nMany efforts have been made in times gone by to use kerosene for firing\r\nthe boilers of steam-engines. In naval vessels a great deal is so used\r\nat the present time. But the chief method of employing oil for\r\ngenerating power is to use it in an internal combustion-engine. These\r\nmachines have been dealt with at length in _Engineering of To-day_ and\r\n_Mechanical Inventions of To-day_ and so must be simply mentioned here.\r\nThey consist of two types. In one, which is exemplified by the ordinary\r\ncar or bicycle motor, the oil is gasified in a vessel called a\r\ncarburetter or vaporiser and then led into the cylinder of the engine,\r\ntogether with the necessary air to enable it to burn. At the right\r\nmoment a spark ignites the mixture, which burns suddenly, causing a\r\nsudden expansion, in other words, an explosion. Thus the power of the\r\nengine is derived from a succession of explosions. If the fuel be petrol\r\nit vaporises at the ordinary temperature of the engine and needs no\r\nadded heat. With kerosene, however, heat has to be employed in the\r\nvaporiser to make it turn readily into a gas.\r\n\r\nThe other method is employed in engines of the new \"Diesel\" type, in\r\nwhich the cylinder of the engine, being already filled with hot air, has\r\na jet of oil sprayed into it. The heat of the air causes it to burst\r\ninto flame, causing an expansion which drives the engine.\r\n\r\nAn important feature in the latter type of engine is that the oil is\r\nvery completely burnt, so that very heavy oils can be used, oils which,\r\nif employed in an engine of the other kind, would choke up the cylinder\r\nwith soot. In other words, the range of oils which can be used in this\r\nnew kind of engine is much wider than is possible in the others. The\r\nlatter may be likened to a fastidious man who is very particular about\r\nhis food, while the former resembles the man of hearty appetite who can\r\neat anything. And just as a man of the latter sort is more easily\r\nprovided for by the domestic authorities, so the Diesel engine makes the\r\nproblem of the provision of liquid fuel much simpler.\r\n\r\nFor it must never be forgotten that the provision of liquid fuel for the\r\nworld is by no means a simple matter, since the supply is by no means\r\nadequate. The output runs into thousands of millions of gallons, and the\r\nwhole world is being searched for new fields of oil, and yet it is all\r\nswallowed up as fast as it can be produced, while the coal mines do not\r\nfeel the competition. A year or so ago the United States and Russia\r\nbetween them (and they are the greatest producers) obtained\r\n5,000,000,000 gallons of oil, seemingly an enormous quantity. But, on\r\nthe other hand, Great Britain alone produces over 250,000,000 _tons_ of\r\ncoal per annum. If, therefore, liquid fuel is to displace coal, as some\r\npeople lightly think it is going to do, the supply will have to be\r\nmultiplied many times. In the amount of heat which it is capable of\r\ngiving the coal of Great Britain alone beats the oil produced by the\r\nwhole world.\r\n\r\nAnd another thing to be borne in mind is that as the coal miner goes\r\ndown to the seam and sees for himself what is there, while the oil\r\nproducer simply stays at the surface and draws it up with a pump, the\r\ncoal man knows far more as to how much there is still left than the oil\r\nman does. We know that the coal deposits will last for many years to\r\ncome, even if the production go on increasing, whereas the oil supply\r\nmay fall off in the near future instead of increasing.\r\n\r\nAnd in both cases we are using up capital. Coal is not being made on the\r\nearth now, at any rate in any appreciable quantity. The stage of the\r\nearth's history favourable to the formation of coal measures has long\r\ngone by. And the same probably applies to oil.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting in this connection to note that coal itself is to a\r\ncertain extent, or can be at all events, a source of oil. When coal is\r\nheated in order to make it give up its gas, or to turn it into coke,\r\nvapours are given off which on cooling become coal-tar. At one time\r\nregarded only as a crude sort of paint, this is now the source from\r\nwhich many chemical substances are obtained, varying from photographic\r\nchemicals to saccharine, a substitute for sugar. So valuable are these\r\nproducts that there is a brisk demand for the tar, in other directions\r\nthan the manufacture of oils, but oils of various kinds are also\r\nobtained from it.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the operations is fractional distillation, after the\r\nmanner just described for petroleum. The first \"fraction\" is \"coal-tar\r\nnaphtha.\" Then follows \"carbolic oil,\" after that \"heavy\" or \"creosote\r\noil,\" anthracene oil, and finally there remains in the still on cooling\r\na solid residue known as coal-pitch. The naphtha, on being distilled\r\nagain, gives, among other things, benzine, from which the famous aniline\r\ndyes are made, and which is useful in many industries. Creosote is\r\nlargely employed as a preservative for wood, being forced into the\r\ntimber under high pressure, so that it penetrates right into it and\r\ntends to prevent rotting, no matter how wet it may be. Railway sleepers\r\nare thus treated, small truck-loads of them being run into a cast-iron\r\ntunnel which is then sealed at both ends, while the creosote is forced\r\nin by powerful pumps. After such treatment they can lie nearly buried in\r\nthe damp ballast for a long time without any deterioration.\r\n\r\nThese coal-tar substances are all very similar to petroleum and its\r\nproducts, hydro-carbons, compounds of hydrogen and carbon in various\r\nproportions. Many of them could be used for fuel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of Dupont Powder Co._\r\n\r\n                    APPLE TREE PLANTED WITH A SPADE\r\n\r\nThis apple tree was planted in the ordinary way with a spade. Compare\r\n     its size with that in following illustration at p. 48.]\r\n\r\nBut since they are based upon the supply of coal, which is itself\r\nlimited, they cannot, however they may be used, do more than stave off\r\nthe evil day when the supply will be exhausted.\r\n\r\nQuite different is it with alcohol, which it seems likely may be the\r\nfuel of the future. Some people will be inclined to exclaim \"What a pity\r\nto burn it!\" since to many the word conveys ideas of another sort\r\naltogether. There are many nowadays, however, who, like the writer, have\r\nnone but a scientific interest in it. To such whisky, for example, is\r\nbut \"impure\" alcohol, and it is without the \"impurities\" that it may\r\nbecome of vast use to the world, thereby possibly repaying man for some\r\nof the harm which in the past it has inflicted upon him.\r\n\r\nAlcohol, again, is a hydrocarbon. It is really more correct to speak of\r\nit in the plural, as \"alcohols,\" since there is a large group of\r\nsubstances all of the same name. Two of these are of the greatest\r\nimportance, methyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol. The former is obtained\r\nfrom wood, hence it is sometimes called wood spirit. Wood is strongly\r\nheated in an iron still, and the methyl alcohol is given off in the form\r\nof vapour, which on being collected and cooled condenses into liquid. It\r\nis exceedingly unpleasant to the taste: if it were the only kind there\r\nwould be no consumption of alcohol as a drink.\r\n\r\nThe second kind mentioned is obtained by the agency of germs or\r\nmicrobes, and the story of its production is so interesting as to demand\r\na little space.\r\n\r\nWe will commence with the maltster. He performs the first part of the\r\noperation. Starting with ordinary barley, by the action of heat, aided\r\nby natural growth, he produces the raw material on which the brewer may\r\nwork. Now barley, like all grain, is largely made up of starch, and\r\nalthough starch will not make alcohol, it can be turned into sugar,\r\nwhich will. So the task of the maltster is to commence the change of the\r\nstarch in the grain into sugar.\r\n\r\nFirst of all it is soaked in water and spread upon floors and heated\r\nuntil it begins to sprout. There is a little part in each grain called\r\nthe endosperm, which is the embryonic plant, and the starch is really\r\nthe food provided by nature to nourish the growing endosperm until such\r\ntime as it shall be strong enough to draw its nourishment from the soil.\r\nIn order that it may not be washed away prematurely, the starch is\r\nlocked up by nature in closely fastened cells, and, moreover, it is\r\ninsoluble, so that water cannot carry it away. The endosperm, however,\r\nhas at its disposal certain substances known as enzymes (and it\r\nincreases its store of these as it grows), one of which is able to\r\ndissolve away the walls of the cells, to unlock the treasures, as it\r\nwere, while the other turns the insoluble starch into soluble matter, in\r\nwhich state the growing organism is able to make use of it as food.\r\n\r\nSo as the grain sprouts upon the maltster's floor this process is going\r\non--the cells are being opened and their contents converted from starch\r\ninto soluble matters. Then, when the growth has gone far enough, the\r\ngrain is transferred to a kiln, where it is subjected to heat, by which\r\nthe growth is stopped. The living part of the grain is, in fact, killed.\r\nThat is mainly to stop the young plant from eating up the altered\r\nstarch, which it would do if allowed time, but which the brewer wants to\r\nbe kept for his own use.\r\n\r\nThe maltster's task is now finished, and we come to the brewer's. The\r\nfirst thing he does with the malt is to crush it between rolls, thereby\r\nliberating thoroughly those substances which have been formed from the\r\nstarch and which he intends to turn into sugar. Having crushed it, he\r\nplaces it in the \"mash tun,\" a large tank of wood or iron, in which it\r\nis mixed with water and subjected to heat. While in this vessel the\r\nenzymes become active again and turn the soluble starch, or a part of\r\nit, into a kind of sugar.\r\n\r\nThe liquid drawn off from the mash tun, containing, of course, the\r\nsugar, is subsequently boiled, numerous flavouring matters (including\r\nhops) are added, and then it is cooled again, ready for the final\r\nprocess--fermentation.\r\n\r\nThis takes place in a large vat or \"tun\" and is brought about by the\r\nagency of yeast which is added to the liquid.\r\n\r\nNow yeast is a multitude of microscopic plants round in shape and about\r\none three-thousandth of an inch in diameter. Though so small, this\r\nlittle organism is really quite complicated in its structure, and within\r\nits little body there are carried on complicated chemical changes which\r\nbaffle entirely the most learned chemist to imitate. Further, he has yet\r\nto find out how the little yeast plant does it. He not only cannot\r\nimitate the process, he does not know what the process is. These little\r\norganisms multiply mainly by the process of \"budding.\" A new one grows\r\nout of the side of each old one, rapidly reaches maturity, breaks away\r\nand commences an independent existence. No sooner is it free than it in\r\nturn gives birth to another. Indeed so great is its hurry to propagate\r\nitself that sometimes the new cell begins to throw out a bud before it\r\nhas itself separated from its parent. It is therefore easy to see that\r\nyeast increases in quantity by what some call \"leaps and bounds,\" but\r\nwhich the mathematically minded know as geometrical progression.\r\n\r\nThe particular form of sugar with which we are concerned here is known\r\nas \"dextro-glucose.\" This the yeast splits up into alcohol and carbonic\r\nacid gas. The latter bubbles up to the surface, and escapes into the\r\nair, while the alcohol becomes dissolved in the watery liquid. It is\r\nbelieved that the yeast performs this operation not directly, but by the\r\nproduction of certain enzymes, which in their turn act upon the sugar.\r\n\r\nThe liquid so formed is beer. But since it is alcohol with which we are\r\nconcerned, and not beer, many details connected with its manufacture\r\nhave been omitted. Enough has been said, however, to show that by\r\ncomparatively simple processes grain of all sorts, in fact, anything\r\nwhich contains starch, and such things are to be found in worldwide\r\nprofusion, can be turned into alcohol. All the really intricate chemical\r\nfunctions are performed readily and cheaply by living organisms. All\r\nman has to do is to set up the conditions under which the organisms can\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIn the process just described only a portion of the starch in the grain\r\nis converted into sugar, hence the percentage of alcohol in beer is\r\ncomparatively small. If all the starch be converted a liquid much\r\nstronger in alcohol is produced, and if that be distilled, so as to\r\nseparate the spirit from the water with which it is mixed, there results\r\nwhisky. Brandy, likewise, is the spirit distilled from wine, rum from\r\nmolasses, and so on. In all these familiar beverages the essential\r\nfeature is this same alcohol, of the variety known as ethyl alcohol.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that in the making of beer the alcohol is actually\r\nformed in water. There is a sugary water which under the action of the\r\nyeast becomes an alcoholic water. And this indicates a very useful\r\nfeature about the liquid when used for industrial purposes. A tank full\r\nof petrol is extremely dangerous, so much so that the storage of petrol\r\nis hedged about by all manner of precautions. The danger is that it\r\ngives off an inflammable vapour and that if it once begin to burn there\r\nis practically no possibility of putting it out. Being lighter than\r\nwater, it simply clothes with a layer of fire any water which may be\r\nthrown on to it. The water in such circumstances simply serves to spread\r\nthe naming petrol about and so to make matters worse. Now alcohol, with\r\nits partiality for the companionship of water, behaves quite\r\ndifferently. True, it also may give off an inflammable vapour, but if a\r\nquantity of it catch fire it can be extinguished in the usual way by a\r\nfire-engine. The water and alcohol immediately combine--the alcohol\r\nbecomes dissolved in the water just as sugar may do, and as soon as the\r\npercentage of water in the mixture becomes considerable the burning\r\nstops.\r\n\r\nIt may be that some readers will have discovered this fact for\r\nthemselves without knowing precisely what it was. It is a common dodge\r\nwith amateur photographers if they want to dry a negative quickly to\r\nimmerse it in methylated spirit. The spirit seems to take the water out\r\nof the film and, itself drying quickly, leaves the negative in a\r\nperfectly dry condition in a few minutes. Now after using spirit in that\r\nway it is useless to put it in a spirit stove or lamp. It will not burn.\r\nMethylated spirit is alcohol, and the reason why it has such a quick\r\ndrying action is that it and the water in the wet film quickly mix.\r\nAfter immersion the film is wet, not with water merely, but with a\r\nmixture of a lot of spirit and a little water. Hence the speed with\r\nwhich it evaporates. And the non-inflammability of the mixture is due to\r\nthe presence of the water.\r\n\r\nMethylated spirit only differs from the alcohol in alcoholic beverages\r\nin that something is added to make it undrinkable. Owing to the craving\r\nfor it, which is so widespread, and the doubtful effect which it has on\r\ncertain citizens, most states regard it as pre-eminently a subject for\r\ntaxation, thereby on the one hand bringing in a good revenue, and on the\r\nother discouraging its too free use. But those considerations apply only\r\nto drinkable alcohol. That which is to be used for industrial purposes\r\nis not in any way a legitimate object for taxation. Hence the problem\r\narises of making a form of alcohol which shall answer all the needs of\r\nthe industries which use it, and at the same time be so repulsive to the\r\nsenses that no one can possibly drink it. This result is achieved by\r\nadding some of the methyl alcohol derived from the vapour given off by\r\nwood when heated. Commonly known as \"wood spirit,\" this is so unpleasant\r\nthat it renders the mixture of no use for drinking, and so it can safely\r\nbe freed from taxation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this spirit has less heating value than petrol. That means\r\nthat a given quantity of each liquid will produce more heat in the case\r\nof petrol than in the case of alcohol. Indeed the difference is about\r\ntwo to one. Hence an engine to give out a certain horse-power would need\r\nto have its cylinders twice as big if it were to use alcohol instead of\r\nthe other fuel. There is a certain compensation, however, in the fact\r\nthat alcohol is very easily compressible. In modern internal\r\ncombustion-engines much of the efficiency is due to the explosive charge\r\nwhich is drawn into the cylinder being compressed into a small space\r\nbefore it is fired. It was the discovery of the value of compressing the\r\ngas which made the gas-engine so formidable a rival to the steam-engine,\r\nand the wonderful performances of the Diesel engines are due very\r\nlargely to the fact that the air is compressed in the cylinder to a very\r\nhigh pressure. The jet of oil burns in highly compressed air. And\r\nbecause of the facility with which alcohol can be compressed it is said\r\nto be more effective as a source of motive power than would be expected\r\nfrom its comparatively feeble heat.\r\n\r\nThus we may sum up the possibilities of the future. Coal, petroleum and\r\ntheir derivatives exist in limited quantities in the world, and so far\r\nas we can see the vast drafts which we are taking from them are not\r\nbeing replaced, indeed at this stage of the earth's development cannot\r\nbe replaced, by any more. Sooner or later we must come to an end of\r\nthem. Is it not comforting, therefore, to know that there is another\r\nsource of fuel at hand, inexhaustible, since it can be produced as\r\nneeded. We have only to set the sun and the ground to work to produce\r\ngrain, rice, potatoes, or any of the myriad substances which contain\r\nstarch, and from that, by simple and well-known processes, we can obtain\r\na cheap, safe and reliable fuel. Indeed there seems nothing but the\r\nultimate loss of sunlight, countless millions of years hence, which can\r\never check the supply of this valuable commodity. What has doubtless, in\r\nmany cases, been a curse in the past may turn out to be the great boon\r\nof the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSOME VALUABLE ELECTRICAL PROCESSES\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents of that branch of science known as physics are coming to the\r\nconclusion that electricity plays a much more important part in the\r\nuniverse than was supposed. They are led to believe that electrical\r\nattraction is the cement which binds together those exceedingly minute\r\nparticles out of which everything is built up. Whether electricity binds\r\nthem together or not, it is certain that electrical action can in some\r\ncases _separate_ those particles, and this process of separation\r\nprovides a means of carrying on some very remarkable and useful\r\nindustrial processes.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine a vessel filled with water to which has been added a\r\nlittle sulphuric acid, while suspended in it are two strips of platinum.\r\nThere is a space between the strips, so that when their upper ends are\r\nsuitably connected to a source of electric current that current flows\r\nfrom one strip to the other _through the liquid_.\r\n\r\nThat is an example of the apparatus for carrying out this electrical\r\nseparation in its simplest form, and it will facilitate the further\r\ndescription if the names of various parts are enumerated.\r\n\r\nThe process itself is electrolysis; the liquid is the electrolyte, while\r\nthe strips are the electrodes. The individual electrodes, again, have\r\nspecial names, that by which the current enters being the anode and that\r\nby which it leaves the cathode. It is not difficult to remember which is\r\nwhich if we bear in mind that the current traverses them in alphabetical\r\norder. Since, however, it may not be easy for the general reader to\r\ncarry all these terms in his mind, we will, when it is necessary to\r\ndifferentiate between the two electrodes, call one the in-electrode and\r\nthe other the out-electrode.\r\n\r\nReturning now to our imaginary apparatus, let us turn on the current. At\r\nfirst nothing seems to be happening, although suitable instruments would\r\nshow that current was flowing. Soon, however, little bubbles appear upon\r\nthe electrodes, and these grow larger and larger, until they detach\r\nthemselves from the platinum to which they have been adhering, float up\r\nto the surface and burst. The question which naturally arises is, What\r\ndo those bubbles consist of? Are they air?\r\n\r\nIf we take means to collect the gases which formed them we get an\r\nunmistakable answer. The bubbles which arise from the in-electrode are\r\noxygen, those from the other hydrogen. If we allow our apparatus to work\r\nfor some time, and collect all the gas which arises, we shall find that\r\nthere is twice as much hydrogen as oxygen. We shall also find, as the\r\nprocess goes on, that the quantity of water diminishes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I may be allowed at this point to remind my readers that water\r\nis a collection of minute ultra-microscopic particles called\r\n\"molecules,\" each of which is formed of three smaller particles still\r\ncalled \"atoms.\" Of the three atoms two are hydrogen and one oxygen.\r\nWater therefore consists of hydrogen and oxygen, there being twice as\r\nmuch of the former as there is of the latter.\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, that electrolysis gives us hydrogen and oxygen in\r\nexactly those proportions in which they occur in water, and since we\r\nalso see that as these gases appear the water itself disappears, we are\r\nled to conclude that the current is splitting up the water into the\r\ngases of which it is formed.\r\n\r\nBut the strange thing is that this will not work with pure water. We\r\nhave to add something to it. In the case of our imaginary experiment it\r\nwas sulphuric acid. What part does that play?\r\n\r\nThis is not fully understood, but we may be able to form a mental\r\npicture of what is believed to happen as follows.\r\n\r\nThe in-electrode is surrounded by a vast assemblage of these tiny\r\nmolecules, most of them those of water, but a few those of the acid. The\r\nlatter are more complex in their structure than the former, but they too\r\ncontain hydrogen. Current flows into the electrode and instantly\r\nhydrogen atoms from the _acid_ molecules crowd round it, like boatmen at\r\nthe seaside anxious to secure a passenger. Each takes on board a\r\nquantity of electricity and with it darts across the intervening space\r\nto the other electrode. Arrived there, it gives up its load and, its\r\nwork done, remains lying upon the electrode until enough others like\r\nunto itself have gathered there to form a bubble and so escape. These\r\nhydrogen atoms are thought to be the _craft which carry the current\r\nthrough the liquid_ and enable it to pose, as it were, as a conductor of\r\nelectricity, which in reality it is not.\r\n\r\nBut where does the oxygen come from?\r\n\r\nTo find the answer to that we must add a second chapter to our story.\r\nWhen the hydrogen \"boats\" took on board their load of electricity they\r\nleft their former associates, and these forthwith \"set upon\"\r\nneighbouring water molecules and with the audacity of highwaymen stole\r\nfrom them enough hydrogen atoms to take the place of those they had\r\nlost. Thus the acid molecules became complete once more, while the scene\r\nof the conflict near the in-electrode was strewn with the remains of the\r\nwater molecules from which the hydrogen atoms had been stolen. These\r\nremains, of course, would be oxygen, and they, collecting together on\r\nthe electrode, would eventually be in numbers sufficient to form bubbles\r\nand so escape.\r\n\r\nThus it may be the acid which really does the work, yet because of its\r\nsubsequent raid upon the water it is the latter which disappears, and it\r\nis the materials of the latter which are bought to the surface in the\r\nbubbles.\r\n\r\nAnd there we see the mechanism whereby, so it is believed, electric\r\ncurrent can pass through otherwise non-conducting liquids. And the\r\nimportant point, as far as practical utility is concerned, is that the\r\npassage of the current is accompanied by a splitting up of something or\r\nother, either the water or something in it, the materials of which are\r\ndeposited, one on one electrode and the other on the other.\r\n\r\nAnd now we can proceed to those useful applications of electrolysis, the\r\ncommonest of which, perhaps, is electro-plating.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how electrolysis causes hydrogen, probably out of the acid,\r\nto be deposited upon one electrode. Suppose that, instead of an acid, we\r\nput in the water one of those substances known to chemists as a \"salt,\"\r\nthe commonest example of which is ordinary table salt. This well-known\r\ncondiment is caused by the interaction of hydrochloric acid and the\r\nmetal sodium and will serve to illustrate what all salts are.\r\n\r\nAll acids are compounds of hydrogen and something else, and their biting\r\naction is due to the readiness with which the \"something else\" evicts\r\nthe hydrogen and takes in a metal in its place. Thus hydrochloric acid,\r\ngiven the opportunity, gets rid of its hydrogen and takes in sodium,\r\nthereby forming chloride of soda or common salt.\r\n\r\nAnother example is the gold chloride familiar to photographers. This is\r\nthe result of the action of certain acids upon gold, wherein the acids\r\nthrow out their hydrogen and take in gold instead.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, a salt is just the same sort of thing as an acid, like\r\nthe sulphuric acid which we used in our \"experiment,\" except that some\r\nmetal has taken the place of the hydrogen.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, then, to find that if we put a salt in the\r\nelectrolyte instead of an acid we get a similar result. In the one case\r\nhydrogen is deposited upon the out-electrode, in the other the metal. In\r\nthe former case, since hydrogen is a gas, it forms bubbles and floats\r\naway, but in the latter the solid metal remains a thin, even coating\r\nupon the electrode. That is the principle of electro-plating.\r\n\r\nThe electrolyte consists of a suitable solution containing a salt of the\r\nmetal to be deposited, and it is placed in an insulating vessel or vat.\r\nThe articles to be plated form the out-electrode, so that they have to\r\nbe suspended in some convenient way from a metal conductor by conducting\r\nwires. Of course they are entirely immersed in the liquid. The\r\nin-electrode is sometimes a plate of platinum (the reason that expensive\r\nmetal is used being that it is unaffected by the chemicals) or else a\r\nplate of the metal being deposited. In the former case, the solution\r\nbecomes weaker as the work proceeds, and more salt has to be added. In\r\nthe latter, however, the strength of the solution remains unchanged, for\r\nby an interesting interchange the in-electrode adds to it just what it\r\nloses by deposition upon the other one. The effect is therefore just as\r\nif the current tore off particles from the one and placed them upon the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThis is believed to be due to the agency of the oxygen which in the case\r\nof the electrolysis of water becomes free, but which in this case forms\r\nwith the metal electrode a layer of oxide upon its surface, this oxide\r\nbeing then dissolved away by the liquid. Thus as fast as the metal is\r\ndeposited upon the out-electrode its place is taken by more metal from\r\nthe in-electrode.\r\n\r\nIn some processes it is desired to deposit metal upon a non-conducting\r\nsurface, and it is evident that such cannot be used as an electrode. Nor\r\nis it any use to attempt to deposit upon anything except an electrode.\r\nThe only thing to do, then, is to make the object a conductor by some\r\nmeans. Models in clay, wax and plaster, once-living objects like small\r\nanimals, fruit, flowers or insects, can, however, have a perfect replica\r\nmade of them by electrical deposition, by the simple method of coating\r\nthe surface to be plated with a thin layer of plumbago. This skin,\r\nalthough extremely thin, is a sufficiently good conductor to make the\r\nprocess possible. Process blocks for printing are copied in this way, so\r\nthat a particularly delicate example of the blockmaker's art need not be\r\nworn down by much pressing, copies or \"electros\" being made off it for\r\nactual use in the press.\r\n\r\nThe original block is a plate of copper on which the picture is\r\nrepresented by minute depressions and prominences. On this a layer of\r\nsoft wax is pressed, so as to obtain a perfect but reversed copy. Having\r\nbeen coated with plumbago, this is then put into a vat containing a\r\nsolution of copper salts and is used as the out-electrode, the other\r\nbeing a plate of copper. When the current is turned on the copper is\r\nthus deposited on the wax until a thin sheet of copper is formed which\r\nis an exact but reversed copy of the wax, a direct copy, that is, of the\r\noriginal block.\r\n\r\nThe back of this thin sheet is then covered with molten lead or type\r\nmetal to fill up any depressions and to give it sufficient strength.\r\nAnyone who has seen one of these \"half-tone\" blocks covered with minute\r\ndepressions so slight that they can scarcely be seen, yet so perfect\r\nthat a beautiful print can be obtained from them, will realise the\r\nwonderful power of this electrolytic process, the marvellous accuracy\r\nwith which the original is copied, and the unerring way in which the\r\nelectric current carries the particles of copper into every one of the\r\nmyriad recesses in the wax.\r\n\r\nAnother specimen of the marvellous work of this system is the wax\r\ncylinder of the phonograph. The sound is produced by a needle trailing\r\nalong a groove of varying depth cut in the surface of the cylinder. This\r\ngroove forms a spiral, passing round and round like the thread of a\r\nscrew, and it encircles the cylinder one hundred times in every inch of\r\nits length. Consequently, at any point one may take, there is but one\r\none-hundredth of an inch from the centre of one turn to the centre of\r\nthe turn on either side of it. And at its deepest the groove is less\r\nthan one-thousandth of an inch deep. The phonograph itself cuts the\r\nfirst \"master\" record, as it is termed, and the problem is to take a\r\nnumber of casts off this model of such delicacy and accuracy that every\r\nvariation in that exceedingly fine groove shall be faithfully\r\nreproduced. Such a task might well be given up as hopeless, but with\r\nthe help of electrolysis it is accomplished easily and cheaply.\r\n\r\nTo attempt to press anything upon the surface of the \"master\" would but\r\nsmooth out the soft wax and obliterate the groove altogether. To apply\r\nanything softened by heating would be to melt it. But electrolysis,\r\nwithout tending in any way to distort or damage the delicately cut\r\nsurface, deposits upon it a surface of metal from which thousands of\r\ncasts can be made. The gentle fingers of the electricity overlay the\r\nsoft wax with the hard, strong metal with a minute perfection almost\r\nbeyond belief.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, the master record is placed upon a sort of turntable\r\nin a vacuum and turned round in the neighbourhood of two strips of\r\ngold-leaf strongly electrified. By this means the gold is vaporised and\r\na perfect coating of gold is laid upon the wax. This is far too thin to\r\nbe of any use, except to render the cylinder a conductor, for the\r\ncoating is so fragile that it is no stronger than the wax itself. It\r\nenables the cylinder, however, to be electro-plated with copper until it\r\nis surrounded by a strong metallic shell a sixteenth of an inch thick.\r\nIt takes about four days to deposit this thickness. The copper shell is\r\nthen turned smooth in a lathe and fitted tightly into a brass jacket. A\r\nlittle cooling causes the wax record to shrink sufficiently to free it\r\nfrom the copper shell and allow it to be lifted out. A copper mould is\r\nthus formed in which any number of additional records can be cast. The\r\nmolten wax is simply introduced into the inside, and allowed to set; the\r\ninside is bored out in a lathe, and then with a little cooling it\r\nshrinks and can be withdrawn, a completely finished record, every tiny\r\ndepression or swelling in the original master being reproduced with an\r\naccuracy almost incredible.\r\n\r\nAnother valuable use to which this process is put is the purification of\r\nmetals. The electro-chemical action works with unerring precision: it\r\nnever mistakes an atom of iron for an atom of copper, for example.\r\nPassing through a solution of copper salt, the current deposits only\r\ncopper.\r\n\r\nFor modern electrical machinery and apparatus copper is required of the\r\nutmost possible purity, for every impurity adds to its electrical\r\nresistance, in other words, diminishes its value as a conductor.\r\nConsequently thousands of tons of \"electrolytic\" copper, as it is\r\ntermed, are produced every year. The electrodes used are plates of\r\nordinary copper. A coating of pure metal is deposited by electrolysis\r\nupon the out-electrode from the other one. When the deposit is thick\r\nenough the out-electrode is taken out and the deposit torn off it, the\r\nunion between the two being sufficiently imperfect for this to be done\r\nwithout difficulty. The metal of which the in-electrode is made has\r\nalready been purified by other processes, until it contains but one per\r\ncent. of foreign matter, and by this means even that small percentage is\r\nentirely got rid of. The impurities fall to the bottom of the vessel in\r\nthe form of \"slime,\" which is periodically removed.\r\n\r\nAnd not only is electrolysis thus unerring in picking out certain atoms\r\nfrom among a mixture, but there is an exact relation between the work\r\ndone and the quantity of current used. Consequently it forms a very\r\nexact method of measuring currents. The method of measuring current by\r\nthe strength of the magnetic field which it produces has been mentioned\r\nalready, and such measurements can be checked by electrolysis. Thus the\r\npractical definition of the ampere is \"that current which when passed\r\nthrough a solution of silver nitrate in water will deposit silver at the\r\nrate of .001118 gramme per second.\"\r\n\r\nThe electric accumulator or secondary battery, one of the most useful\r\nappliances, is the result of electrolysis reversed. Many large\r\nelectric-lighting plants have in addition to their generating machinery\r\na large battery of secondary cells, which, being kept charged, are able\r\nto help the machinery in times of heavy demand, or even to supply the\r\nwhole current needed for, say, half-an-hour, so that the whole of the\r\nmachinery could, in the event of an accident, be shut down for that time\r\nand the supply maintained from the batteries. This would be sufficient\r\nin many cases for fresh machinery to be brought into action or emergency\r\narrangements to be made.\r\n\r\nIt may be that this book is being read by someone seated serenely in his\r\narm-chair while engineers and workmen at the generating station are\r\nworking in frantic haste to set right some sudden breakdown before the\r\nbatteries are run down. The batteries may have saved the town\r\nhalf-an-hour's darkness.\r\n\r\nLarge telegraph offices are fitted with secondary batteries. Many\r\nmotorists owe the ignition which keeps their engines at work to\r\nsecondary batteries. It is secondary batteries which keep the wireless\r\napparatus at work on a wrecked vessel after the engines have stopped.\r\nIndeed secondary batteries are one of the most beneficent inventions.\r\nAnd if only they could be made in a lighter form than is possible at\r\npresent their value would be infinitely increased.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the passage of current through acidulated water\r\nproduces hydrogen and oxygen. If those gases be collected in closed\r\nvessels over the water, so that they remain in contact with the water,\r\nas soon as the current is stopped a reverse action sets in. The gases\r\ntend to recombine with the electrolyte and in so doing to give back a\r\ncurrent equal to that which formed them. Fig. 4 shows the construction\r\nof what is called a voltameter, in which the gases arising from the\r\nelectrodes are collected in little glass vessels placed just above them.\r\nSuch an apparatus enables us to see easily how the accumulator works.\r\nThe picture shows the battery which is effecting the separation of the\r\noxygen and hydrogen. If that be disconnected, and the wires joined, as\r\nshown by the dotted line, a current will flow back until the oxygen and\r\nhydrogen have returned into the solution again. The apparatus will, in\r\nfact, work like an ordinary battery, except that instead of a plate or\r\nrod of zinc a mass of hydrogen will form the essential part.\r\n\r\nAn appliance such as a voltameter is not of much use for the practical\r\npurpose of storing large quantities of electrical energy, because the\r\nsurfaces of the electrodes are so small and the surfaces where liquid\r\nand gases are in contact are small too. It is clear that the larger the\r\nelectrodes are the wider will be the passage for the current, just as a\r\nwide road can accommodate more traffic than a narrow path. We may regard\r\nthe electrodes as like gateways through which the current passes. By\r\nmaking them large, therefore, we enable a large current to pass, and\r\nconsequently permit electrolysis to take place with great comparative\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe \"plates,\" as the electrodes in a secondary battery are termed, are\r\ngenerally large metal plates. Experiment has shown that lead is the best\r\nfor this purpose. It has also been found that it can be improved by\r\nmaking it porous, since the inner surfaces of the pores are so much\r\nadded surface through which current can pass into the electrolyte. There\r\nare various ways of producing this porosity, which need not trouble us\r\nhere, however. It will suffice for our purpose to understand that an\r\nordinary secondary cell consists of two lead plates, with the largest\r\npossible surface, immersed in a liquid, generally a dilute solution of\r\nsulphuric acid in water.\r\n\r\nTo charge the battery, current is sent to one plate, through the liquid\r\nto the other plate, and so away. A thin film of hydrogen is thus formed\r\nupon the outgoing plate, while oxygen is formed at the incoming one.\r\nSince the hydrogen is spread over such a large area, it does not\r\naccumulate sufficiently for much of it to rise to the surface. Most of\r\nit remains adhering to the plate. The oxygen combines with the lead of\r\nits plate and so is safely stored up there in the form of oxide of lead.\r\nThis storage of hydrogen upon the one plate and oxygen on the other\r\ncannot go on indefinitely, and so as soon as the limit is reached the\r\ncell is fully charged. Passage of further current is then simply waste.\r\n\r\nThe dynamo or primary batteries which are used for charging having been\r\ndisconnected, the two plates can be connected together through lamps,\r\nmotors, or in any other desired way, and the current will then flow out\r\nagain, the opposite way to that in which it entered, just as a stone\r\nthrown up in the air returns the opposite way. The current which comes\r\nout is, in fact, a sort of reflex action arising from that which went\r\nin, the mechanism by which it is produced being the reabsorption of the\r\noxygen and hydrogen into the electrolyte.\r\n\r\nWhether a cell is fully charged or not is ascertained by weighing the\r\nelectrolyte, an operation which at first sight seems to have nothing\r\nwhatever to do with the matter. It arises from the difference in weight\r\nbetween water and sulphuric acid, the latter being the heavier. We have\r\nseen that while a little acid must be added to water before it can be\r\nelectrolysed, it is the water which is ultimately resolved into its\r\nconstituent gases. Hence the result of electrolysis is to increase not\r\nthe amount, but the proportion of acid. Therefore it increases the\r\nweight of the electrolyte. This weight is ascertained by means of a\r\n\"hydrometer,\" a glass tube, stopped, and loaded with some small shot at\r\nits lower end. On the upper part is engraved a graduated scale, so that\r\nthe exact depth to which it sinks can be easily read. This depth will,\r\nof course, vary with the specific gravity of the liquid, and so the\r\ndepth recorded by the scale will be an indication of the proportion of\r\nacid, and that in turn will show how far the process of charging has\r\nprogressed.\r\n\r\nAccumulators are, or have been hitherto at any rate, very troublesome\r\nthings. They are apt to lose their power. If not properly charged they\r\nare easily damaged. Too rapid charging or too rapid discharging,\r\nstanding for a while only partly charged--all these things have a bad\r\neffect, in extreme cases even destroying them altogether. Because of the\r\nuse of lead they are terribly heavy too, so much so that for traction\r\npurposes they are of very little use, for a large amount of the energy\r\nstored in the accumulators is then used up in hauling them about.\r\n\r\nYet what a field there is for the successful accumulator! Take the one\r\ninstance of the electrification of a railway. If good light and\r\nefficient accumulators were to be had, no alteration at all would be\r\nnecessary to the permanent way. The engines or motor carriages would\r\nneed to go periodically to a depot to be re-charged, but that could\r\neasily be arranged. Such things as conductor rails, overhead conductors\r\nand so on would be needless.\r\n\r\nThe world has therefore been interested for years in the rumour that T.\r\nA. Edison was engaged upon this problem, and at last he has produced his\r\naccumulator, by which he has removed many of the difficulties, if not\r\nall. Instead of a case of glass or celluloid, as is usual with the older\r\ncells, his cells are enclosed in strong boxes of nickel steel. The\r\npositive plate consists of nickel tubes filled with alternate layers of\r\nnickel hydroxide, while the negative plate is formed of prepared oxide\r\nof iron in a nickel framework. The electrolyte is a solution of\r\npotassium hydroxide. The chemical action and the electrical reaction is,\r\nof course, on the same principle precisely as in the older cells, but it\r\nis claimed that the Edison cells are \"fool-proof\"--that is to say, they\r\ncannot be damaged by careless handling, and they appear to be a little\r\nlighter. Thus the problem is partly solved, and with that as a fresh\r\nstarting-point someone may sooner or later give us a secondary battery\r\nwhich is light as well as strong.\r\n\r\nIf any would-be scientific inventor reads these words there is a\r\nsuggestion for a promising line of investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMACHINE-MADE COLD\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable adaptations of scientific knowledge is the\r\n\"manufacture of cold.\" At first that phrase seems strange, but it is\r\nreally quite legitimate. There are machines at work at this moment which\r\nare turning out cold as if it were any other manufactured article. It is\r\nnot that they manufacture cold water or cold air, it is the cold itself\r\nwhich they produce.\r\n\r\nOf course, cold has no real existence, since it is simply a negative\r\nquantity, an absence of heat, yet its effects are so real that we are in\r\nthe habit of talking of it as if it were a reality, and in that sense we\r\ncan regard it as a product of manufacture.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we see in this a conspicuous instance of the interdependence\r\nof invention and science, for scientific principles were first adapted\r\nto produce cold, and then artificial cold was employed in scientific\r\ninvestigations, whereby the rare gases of the atmosphere have been\r\ndiscovered, as we shall see presently.\r\n\r\nIn _Mechanical Inventions of To-day_ I have dealt with the uses which\r\ncan be made of heat as a motive power. Here we have in some sense a\r\nreversal of the process. In the heat-engine the expenditure of heat\r\nproduces motion. In the refrigerating machine motion produces heat, on\r\nthe face of it a strange way of producing cold. Yet it is by the\r\nproduction of heat in the first instance that we are ultimately able to\r\nobtain the cold.\r\n\r\nOne way to make a thing cold is to place it in contact with ice. But\r\nthat process suffers from severe limitations. In the first place, we may\r\nnot be able to procure ice when we want it. And in the second place, we\r\nmay want to produce a temperature much lower than that of ice.\r\n\r\nNow a machine can produce any degree of coldness, almost down to the\r\n\"absolute zero,\" the point at which a body is absolutely devoid of any\r\nheat whatever, the condition in which its molecules are absolutely\r\nstill. That point is 274 deg. C. _below_ freezing-point. Freezing-point on\r\nthat scale is \"zero,\" and so this _absolute_ zero is _minus_ 274 deg. Or,\r\nto put it another way, freezing-point is 274 deg. _absolute_ temperature.\r\nThe absolute zero has never been reached, and there is reason to believe\r\nthat it never can be quite reached, but by methods about to be described\r\na temperature within a few degrees of it has been attained. And all of\r\nthis can be done without any cooling agent colder than water at an\r\nordinary temperature.\r\n\r\nThere are several systems, but the one which illustrates the principle\r\nmost simply is that in which carbonic acid gas is the \"working fluid.\"\r\nThis is a very compressible gas, and so is well fitted for the purpose.\r\nFirst of all a pump or compressor compresses it. That has the effect of\r\nheating it. Such we might expect from the fact that heat is molecular\r\nactivity: when by compressing the gas we force the molecules closer\r\ntogether, they naturally hit each other and the sides of the containing\r\nvessel harder than they did before, and the increased activity is\r\nmanifested as increased heat. So the first effect, as was remarked just\r\nnow, is to produce, apparently, increased heat.\r\n\r\nBut then the hot compressed gas, by being passed through a coil of pipe\r\nsurrounded by cold water, can be robbed of that heat. According to the\r\nspeed at which it traverses the coil it will be more or less cooled: by\r\ncausing it to travel slowly it can be brought down almost to the\r\ntemperature of the water. So we start with the gas at atmospheric\r\npressure and at somewhere about atmospheric temperature too. This we\r\nconvert into compressed gas at a high temperature. After cooling it we\r\nhave compressed gas at a moderate temperature.\r\n\r\nThen, to complete the process, we let the gas expand again. Now just as\r\ncompressing a gas heats it, letting it expand cools it. If we compressed\r\nit and then expanded it again we should be just as we were to commence\r\nwith. But since, in between the two operations we extract a quantity of\r\nheat by means of the cooling water, we get at the end a very much lower\r\ntemperature than that with which we started.\r\n\r\nWe cannot cool the gas without compressing it, because heat will only\r\nflow from one body into another when the second is cooler than the\r\nfirst. But by making the gas hot temporarily by compression we enable\r\nthe water to draw some heat from it, and then, allowing it to sink back\r\nto its original state, we get practically the old temperature, less what\r\nthe water has extracted. The principle is really absurdly simple when\r\none once gets to understand it. The application is not so simple as far\r\nas the designer of the machine is concerned, for he has to adjust the\r\nvarious parts to exactly the right shape and dimensions, so that they\r\nmay work well with one another and produce the desired result with the\r\nminimum expenditure of power.\r\n\r\nTo the observer, however, and to the user too, the finished machine is\r\nwonderful in its simplicity. The principle is illustrated\r\ndiagrammatically in Fig. 5.\r\n\r\nIn the centre is the compressor. Its action forces the gas along the\r\npipe to the right and down into the condenser. As it flows downwards\r\nthrough the coil there cold water enters at the bottom of the tank,\r\nflows upward past the coil and escapes again at the top. Thus the coil\r\nis kept in contact with _cold_ water.\r\n\r\nPassing then through the bottom of the tank the gas travels from right\r\nto left through the \"regulating valve\" and into an arrangement almost\r\nexactly similar to the condenser but called the evaporator. Here the gas\r\nexpands and suffers a great fall in temperature. This cold is\r\ncommunicated to liquid circulating in the tank which forms a part of the\r\nevaporator, and this liquid can be circulated through pipes into any\r\nrooms to be cooled or around vessels of water which it is desired to\r\nfreeze. This liquid, which acts as the carrier of the cold, is called\r\n\"brine,\" and is water to which is added calcium chloride to keep it from\r\nfreezing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--This diagram shows the working of the\r\nRefrigerating Machine. The pump compresses the gas and drives it through\r\nthe coil in the condenser, where it is cooled by water. It passes thence\r\nthrough the coil in the evaporator, where it expands and cools the\r\nsurrounding brine.]\r\n\r\nNow the observant reader may have noticed that there is no apparent\r\nreason for the name of the left-hand vessel. It will be quite clear,\r\nhowever, when I explain that although I have spoken of the working fluid\r\nall along as gas, I have only done so to avoid bringing in too many\r\nexplanations at once. It is actually liquid for a good part of its\r\njourney. Carbonic acid gas liquefies at a very moderate temperature and\r\npressure, and so while it leaves the compressor as a gas it becomes\r\nliquid in the condenser and remains so until it has passed the\r\nregulating valve. Then it begins to expand into gas once more, and in\r\nthat state it passes back to the compressor.\r\n\r\nThere is a pressure-gauge on the pipe leaving the compressor and another\r\non the one entering it. A comparison of the readings on these two tells\r\nhow the apparatus is working. The difference between them indicates how\r\nmuch compression is being given to the gas. Assuming that the compressor\r\nis working at a constant speed, this compression can be regulated to a\r\nnicety by the valve: close it a little and the compression will\r\nincrease: open it a little and the compression will decrease. By this\r\nmeans the degree of cold produced can be varied at will.\r\n\r\nThis is the way in which many ships are enabled to carry cargoes of\r\nfrozen meat. The chambers in which the meat is stowed are\r\ninsulated--that is to say, their walls are made as impervious as\r\npossible to heat. Then the brine is carried into the chambers in pipes,\r\ncooling them much as the hot-water pipes heat an ordinary public\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nOr another method is to carry the pipe which constitutes the evaporator\r\ninto the chamber to be cooled. A third way is to dispense with brine and\r\nto blow air through the coils of the evaporator, whereby the air is made\r\nto carry away the cold to wherever it is needed.\r\n\r\nIce can be made easily in moulds of metal or wood around which brine\r\ncirculates. If made of ordinary water the ice is likely to be cloudy and\r\nopaque, which is quite good enough for many purposes. In cases where it\r\nis desired that it should be clear, the water is agitated during\r\nfreezing, or else distilled water is used. To enable the blocks to be\r\ngot out of the moulds it is sometimes arranged to circulate warm brine\r\nfor a few moments.\r\n\r\nIce skating rinks are formed by making, first, an insulating layer of\r\nsawdust, slag-wool or something of that sort (those by the way, being\r\nthe materials generally used for insulating cold chambers) underneath\r\nthe floor. The floor, too, is made waterproof and then upon it is laid\r\nas closely as possible a series of iron pipes. Water is flooded on to\r\nthe floor until the pipes are covered to a depth of several inches, and\r\nthen brine is pumped through the pipes. In time the water freezes, and\r\nso long as the brine circulates it remains so.\r\n\r\nBut although the \"CO_{2} process\" described above is the simplest\r\nillustration of the principle, there are other systems. In one very\r\npopular form ammonia gas is the \"working fluid.\" This is liquefied by\r\npressure and cooling with water, being subsequently expanded just as\r\ndescribed above.\r\n\r\nAnother much-used system is the \"ammonia-absorption\" process, in which\r\nthe ammonia is not liquefied, but when under pressure is absorbed by\r\nwater, returning to gas again when the pressure is released.\r\n\r\nBut the degree of cold attained in these commercial machines is as\r\nnothing to the extremely intense cold generated on the same principles\r\nin the liquid-air machine, which is found in every well-equipped\r\nphysical laboratory.\r\n\r\nBriefly, this consists of a coil of many turns of small tube enclosed in\r\na small double vessel, the space between the inner and outer skins of\r\nwhich is packed with insulating material. A compressor pumps air in at\r\nthe top of the coil at a pressure of from 150 to 200 atmospheres. An\r\n\"atmosphere,\" it may be remarked, is a unit often used in scientific\r\nmatters, meaning the normal pressure of the atmosphere, which is,\r\nroughly speaking, 15 lb. per square inch. Hence 200 atmospheres is about\r\n3000 lb. per square inch.\r\n\r\nOf course air so highly compressed as that is hot, but after it has\r\npassed down the coil and has escaped from the valve which liberates it\r\nat the bottom it is much cooler. But that is only the beginning of the\r\noperation. The expanded, and therefore cooled, air finds its way upward\r\nthrough the turns of the coil down which the following air is coming.\r\nThat, expanding in its turn, is colder still, because of the cooling\r\naction of the first air, and so the process goes on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. J. and E. Hall, Ltd., London\r\nand Dartford_\r\n\r\n                        MACHINE-MADE ICE\r\n\r\nHere we see a huge block of ice being lifted (it may be on a hot summer\r\n             day) from the mould in which it has been made]\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps easier to understand if we imagine that the air comes\r\nthrough the coil in gusts and we notice what happens to each succeeding\r\ngust. The first comes down, expands, cools and ascends, thereby cooling\r\nthe second gust as it comes down. The second then, after expansion, will\r\nbe cooler than the first was. That in its turn will cool the third, and\r\nso the third after expansion will be cooler than the second. And that\r\nwill go on, each succeeding gust being cooler than the one before. And\r\nalthough the flow of air is continuous, and not in gusts, the result is\r\njust the same: it goes on getting cooler and cooler until at last the\r\nair comes out in its liquid form. This liquid collects in a little\r\nchamber formed at the bottom of the vessel which contains the coil and\r\ncan be drawn off when desired.\r\n\r\nAir in its liquid state looks very much like water. In fact it is\r\ndifficult to get chance observers to believe that it is not water. It\r\nboils at a temperature far below the freezing-point of water, so that\r\nliquid air if placed in a cup made of ice will boil furiously. Ice is so\r\nmuch the hotter that it behaves towards liquid air as a very hot fire\r\ndoes to water.\r\n\r\nThe feature of the above machine, it will be noticed, is that no cooling\r\nwater is required, as in the refrigerating machine, although the\r\nprinciple of the two is the same. The coil is the \"condenser\" and the\r\nvessel in which it is enclosed is the \"evaporator,\" and so the cold air\r\nproduced by the process in the evaporator cools the coil of the\r\ncondenser. Thus it is \"self-intensive,\" as the makers call it.\r\n\r\nHydrogen can be liquefied in a similar machine, except that it needs a\r\nlittle preliminary cooling with liquid air. Liquid hydrogen is the\r\ncoolest thing known approaching the region of absolute zero.\r\n\r\nAnd now we can turn to the wonderful discoveries which have followed\r\nupon the manufacture of liquid air.\r\n\r\nTo make the story complete we need to go back to the time of Priestly\r\nand Cavendish, early in last century. They investigated the atmosphere\r\nand showed that it consisted of oxygen and nitrogen in certain\r\ninvariable proportions, with under certain conditions a small proportion\r\nof carbonic acid. These facts were so well authenticated, and they\r\nseemed to explain everything so satisfactorily, that it was quite\r\nthought almost up to the end of the nineteenth century that there was\r\nnothing more to learn about the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nNevertheless there was an idea in the minds of some scientists that\r\nthere must be another group of elements somewhere, the existence of\r\nwhich was then undiscovered, but it was never dreamed that these were in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nSoon after the weights of the atoms had been found a medical student\r\nnamed Prout in an anonymous essay called attention to the fact that\r\nthere were curious numerical relationships between them. Speculation on\r\nthe subject went on for many years, until in 1865 the great Russian\r\nchemist Mendeleeff published his conclusions. He had arranged the\r\nelements in the form of a table _in the order of their atomic weights_.\r\nThe table consisted of twelve rows of names forming eight vertical\r\ncolumns, and the remarkable thing was that all those elements which fell\r\ninto any particular column, although their atomic weights were very\r\nwidely different, had similar properties. This enabled him to _predict_\r\nthe discovery of certain new elements, for the table contained a number\r\nof blank spaces. Three elements _have been found_ since, and their\r\natomic weights and properties are just such as to fill three of the\r\nblank spaces. One blank space, it is thought, may be filled some day by\r\nthe gas coronium, which like helium has been discovered in the sun, but\r\nunlike it has not yet been detected here. When it is, there is the place\r\nin the table which it may fill. The table then commenced with what is\r\nstill called Group 1, but for reasons too complicated to explain here it\r\nappeared as if there must be a group before that, a group the chief\r\ncharacteristic of which would be the inactivity of the elements included\r\nin it. These were expected to be of various atomic weights, but these\r\nweights, it was anticipated, would so occur in the intervals between the\r\nothers that they would all fall into a new column to the left of \"Group\r\n1.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1892 Lord Rayleigh was investigating the question of the\r\ndensity of a number of different gases, including, so it happened,\r\nnitrogen. Now there are several ways of procuring nitrogen. One is to\r\nget it from the atmosphere by ridding it of the oxygen with which it is\r\nnormally mixed. Another way is to split up some compound, such as\r\nammonia, of which it forms a part, in such a way as to catch the\r\nnitrogen and leave the other elements with which it was combined\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nLord Rayleigh tried both ways, and he found that the nitrogen from the\r\natmosphere was denser than that derived from ammonia. Sir William Ramsey\r\nthen carried the matter a step further. He heated atmospheric nitrogen\r\nin the presence of magnesium, under which conditions some of the\r\nnitrogen combines with the latter element to form nitride of magnesium.\r\nThat, it was found, made the remaining nitrogen denser still. The\r\nexplanation then seemed obvious. Suppose we imagine a mixture of sawdust\r\nand iron filings: it will be heavier than an equal quantity of pure\r\nsawdust. And if we contrive to take away some of the sawdust from the\r\nmixture we shall find that what is left is heavier still, when compared\r\nwith an equal bulk of pure sawdust. For it is clear that as we take away\r\nsawdust we thereby increase the proportion of the heavier iron filings\r\nand so we make the mixture heavier.\r\n\r\nApplying a similar process of reasoning to these discoveries, the\r\nconviction grew that the nitrogen of the air was not pure, but that it\r\nhad mixed with it a small proportion of some other gas of greater\r\ndensity. They soon succeeded in isolating this denser gas, to which they\r\ngave the name of argon. Its atomic weight was found, and, wonderful to\r\nrelate, it was such that argon fell into a new column to the left of\r\nGroup 1, as had been anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of argon was announced in 1894. The next year Sir William\r\nRamsey, investigating a gas which had been discovered locked up in the\r\ninterstices of a mineral called clevite, was able to state that it was\r\nhelium, the element which had been previously noticed by the\r\nspectroscope in the sun. Like argon, it was found to be extremely\r\ninactive, and its atomic weight turned out to be such that it too fell\r\ninto the \"Zero Group.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1898 Professors Ramsey and Travers found two more gases in the air,\r\nkrypton and neon, and a little later still, there was found mixed with\r\nthe krypton a further new gas, xenon. All of these had their atomic\r\nweights found, and fell into that new column in the periodic table.\r\n\r\nBut what has all this got to do with liquid air? The two subjects are\r\nclosely related, for it is by liquid-air machines that these rare gases\r\nare now obtained, and it was from liquid air that the last three were\r\nfirst discovered.\r\n\r\nFor air, as we well know, is a mixture of gases, and when extreme cold\r\nand pressure are applied these gases liquefy, each behaving according to\r\nits own nature. They do not all liquefy at the same time, nor on being\r\nrelieved from the pressure and heated do all evaporate again at the same\r\ntemperature. Although they emerge from the liquid-air machine in the\r\nform of a single liquid, it is really a mixture of liquids, each with\r\nits own boiling-point.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier chapter we saw how petroleum can be separated into its\r\nvarious constituents, such as petrol, by fractional distillation,\r\nadvantage being taken of the difference in the \"boiling-point\" of the\r\nvarious \"fractions.\" The boiling-point of a liquid is, of course, the\r\ntemperature at which it turns freely into vapour, and just as petroleum\r\nwhen heated gives off first cymogene, next rhigolene, then petrol,\r\nbenzine, kerosene and so on, in the order named, so liquid air, when it\r\nis evaporated, gives off its different constituents in order. Nitrogen,\r\noxygen, argon, helium, krypton, neon and xenon can all be separated each\r\nfrom the others in this way, by \"fractional distillation.\" The heat from\r\nthe surrounding objects is allowed to get at the liquid, and the gases\r\nare then given off in the order of their boiling-points.\r\n\r\nAnd thus we see how the mechanical production of cold has assisted in\r\nthe pursuit of pure science. The newly-found gases are not of any great\r\nuse at present. They are so inactive that possibly they never will be,\r\nwith one exception, and that is neon. If an electric discharge be made\r\nto pass through a tube filled with this gas, a beautiful glow is the\r\nresult, and it is just possible that neon tubes may become the electric\r\nlight of the future. That is only a prediction, however, and a\r\nhesitating one at that.\r\n\r\nThe inactive elements may become of value in explosives. We have seen\r\nhow important nitrogen is in these dangerous substances, the chief\r\nfeature of which is their instability--their readiness, that is, to\r\nchange into something else--which instability is due to the reluctance\r\nwith which nitrogen enters into them. Now nitrogen, though inactive, is\r\nmuch less so than these others, and if a way should ever be found of\r\ninducing them to enter into a compound, that compound will probably be\r\nan extremely powerful explosive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC INVENTIONS AT SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe safety of our fellow-creatures has always been a strong stimulus to\r\nour inventive faculties. The occurrence of a bad railway accident, and,\r\nroughly, its nature, can be inferred from the files of the Patent\r\nOffice, for such an event brings men's thoughts to devising ways and\r\nmeans of preventing a recurrence, and an avalanche of such inventions\r\ndescends upon the patent department in consequence. In like manner a\r\nparticularly distressing accident to a lifeboat some years ago brought\r\nout many inventions for the improvement of those romantic craft. Many of\r\nthe inventions which arise under these conditions are, of course,\r\nutterly worthless, but some of them \"come to stay.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, therefore, when we think of the almost innumerable\r\nwrecks which happen, even with modern shipping, that human ingenuity has\r\nbeen extremely busy in devising ways for bringing more of safety and\r\nless of risk into the lives of those who go down to the sea in ships. Of\r\nthese perhaps none is more fascinating than the modern lighthouse, with\r\nits tall tower, its brightly flashing light, standing undisturbed in the\r\nwildest storm, quietly and persistently sending forth its guiding rays,\r\nno matter how the elements may be buffeting it. There is something\r\nspecially attractive in this perfect embodiment of quiet strength and\r\ndevotion to duty.\r\n\r\nOf course, its origin is very ancient. One of the earliest inventions,\r\nno doubt, was the bright thought of a very primitive man who lit a fire\r\non a hill to serve as a guide to some belated friends out in their\r\nfishing canoes. From some such beginning the modern lighthouse, a\r\nmagnificent product of the science of civil engineering and the science\r\nof optics, has arisen.\r\n\r\nOf the difficulties encountered in the construction of lighthouse towers\r\non outlying rocks much has been written. The historic Eddystone, for\r\nexample, has quite a voluminous literature of its own. Of the light\r\nitself, however, much less is known.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting first to note the different purposes for which a\r\nlight may be required, and then see how the apparatus of the lighthouse\r\nis made to serve these purposes.\r\n\r\nThere is the \"making\" light, perched, if possible, upon some high\r\neminence, deriving its name from the fact that the sailor sights it as\r\nhe is \"making\" the land. Vessels approaching England from the south-west\r\nby night first see the light at the Lizard. The transatlantic vessels\r\nknow they are approaching land by catching sight of the Fastnet Rock\r\nlight off the coast of Ireland. Cape Race light serves in the same way\r\nfor those about to enter the St Lawrence and Navesink for the entrance\r\nto New York harbour. All such as these have to be of the greatest power\r\npracticable, so that they may be visible not only at the longest\r\npossible distance, but also under unfavourable conditions, such as haze\r\nand slight fog. No light, of course, can penetrate thick fog, but in\r\nlight fog and haze a powerful light can be seen at considerable\r\ndistances. For the same reason these lights must be high up, or the\r\ncurvature of the ocean's surface will limit their range. A light\r\nelevated 100 feet above the sea-level will be visible nearly 16 miles\r\naway, but if only 50 feet up it will be invisible at 13 miles. To be\r\nseen 40 miles away it must be as high as 1000 feet.\r\n\r\nBut then again height is in some cases a disadvantage, for sometimes fog\r\nhovers a little distance above the sea, while below it the air is clear,\r\nand the higher a light may be the more likely is it to have its lantern\r\nimmersed in a floating cloud of fog. Many readers familiar with the\r\nsouth coast of Britain will remember that the light which used to show\r\non the summit of Beachy Head is there no more, but has been replaced by\r\na tower at the foot of the cliffs, the reason being that it may be below\r\nthe clouds of fog which are prevalent at that point.\r\n\r\nBut the mention of Beachy Head introduces us to another class of lights,\r\nknown as \"coasting\" lights, since they are intended to lead the mariner\r\non from point to point along a coast. It will be seen at once that in\r\nmany cases they do not need to be visible at such great distances as the\r\nmaking lights. When the mariner has sighted the Lizard, for example, he\r\nknows where he is. In order that he may learn that important fact as\r\nsoon as possible it is desirable that that light should have the\r\ngreatest possible range, but having thus located himself, when he begins\r\nto feel his way along the English Channel he is guided by the coasting\r\nlights, and so long as they are of such range that he will never be out\r\nof sight of one or two of them that will be sufficient. Thus the Beachy\r\nHead light, in its present low position, has a sufficient range for its\r\npurpose, with the added advantage of more freedom from obscuration by\r\nfog. Thus we see how the local conditions and the purpose of each\r\nparticular light have to be taken into consideration in determining its\r\nposition and power.\r\n\r\nThe Eddystone, again, is an example of a further class. It simply serves\r\nto denote the position of a group of dangerous rocks. Its function is\r\nnot so much guidance, although no doubt it often serves for that, but\r\nfor warning. The Lizard light beckons the on-coming ship to the safety\r\nof the English Channel; the Eddystone warns it away from danger. The\r\nlatter, therefore, and similar lights are \"warning\" lights.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of Messrs. J. and E. Hall, Ltd._\r\n\r\n                              A COLD STORE\r\n\r\nInterior of a cold store, in which meat and poultry are kept good and\r\n         fresh by the use of machine-made cold.--_See_ p. 67]\r\n\r\nRight at the entrance to the English Channel, that greatest of all\r\nhighways for shipping, there lie the Scilly Isles. This group comprises\r\nsome few islands of fair size from which we draw those plentiful\r\nsupplies of beautiful spring flowers, but it also includes a large\r\nnumber of rocky islets which have sent many a strong ship to its doom.\r\nOn one of the islets, therefore, the Bishop's Rock, there now stands a\r\nvery powerful light which exemplifies many whose purpose is the\r\ndouble one of welcoming the mariner as he approaches our shores and at\r\nthe same time warning him of a local danger. Such are both making and\r\nwarning lights.\r\n\r\nOf no less importance, though less impressive, are the guiding lights,\r\nwhich guide the ships into and out of harbours and through narrow\r\nchannels. These are generally arranged in pairs, one of the pair being a\r\nlittle way behind and above the other. Thus when the sailor sees them\r\nboth, one exactly over the other, he knows he is on the right course.\r\n\r\nSometimes lighthouses have subsidiary lights as well as the main light,\r\nto mark a passage between two dangers, or to give warning of some\r\ndanger. The subsidiary lights are often coloured, and they are generally\r\n\"sectors\" showing not all round a complete circle, or even a\r\nconsiderable portion of one, but just in one certain direction. They are\r\ngenerally shown from a window in the tower lower down below the main\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is important to remember that every light must be\r\ndistinguishable from its neighbours. Hence every one in any given\r\nlocality has a different \"character\" from all the others. This character\r\nis given to it by means of flashes. Instead of showing, as the primitive\r\nlights did, a steady light, the modern lighthouse exhibits a series of\r\nflashes, the duration of which, together with the intervals between,\r\ngive it its distinctive character. This flashing arrangement has a\r\nfurther advantage over the steady light. Each flash can be made more\r\npowerful than a steady light could be. But of that more later.\r\n\r\nThe actual source of light varies with circumstances. The electric arc\r\nis, as we all know, a very powerful light, in fact it can be made the\r\nmost powerful of all, but its light is decidedly bluish. Now the time\r\nwhen a light is most of all needed is when the weather is thick. Fogs\r\nvarying from a slight haze to a thick pall of darkness are of very\r\ncommon occurrence, and the lighthouse light must be able as far as\r\npossible to penetrate them.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact clean fog, such as one gets at sea, is not by any\r\nmeans opaque. The black fogs of the great cities are another matter, but\r\nthey are not the sort which afflict the mariner. On a foggy day in the\r\nopen country or by the sea it is often particularly light; indeed the\r\nlight is of a peculiarly diffuse nature which gives a nice even\r\nillumination to everything. Thus we see that fog is really transparent,\r\nbut it diffuses the light. It does not stop the light rays, but simply\r\nbends them about and scatters them in all directions. Thus we can see\r\nnothing through the fog, yet a flood of light reaches us through it. In\r\nits effect it is like that \"crinkled\" glass which is often used for\r\npartitions between rooms, which lets light through, but which cannot be\r\n_seen_ through.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that the effect which a fog produces is mainly to refract\r\nthe light rays. Each little drop of water (for it must be remembered\r\nthat fog is myriads of tiny drops of liquid; it is not vapour) acts like\r\na minute lens, and bends the rays which pass through it. And the more\r\nblue a ray is the more it is bent. On the contrary, the more red it is\r\nthe less is it bent. When a beam of light is analysed in the\r\nspectroscope the red rays are bent least and the blue rays most, so that\r\nthe red rays fall at one end of the spectrum and the blue at the other.\r\n\r\nNow we only _see_ a thing when light rays proceeding from every part of\r\nit fall straight (or nearly so) upon our eyes. Consequently, since red\r\nrays are bent and scattered by the fog less than blue rays are, a red\r\nlight will be more easily seen through a fog than a blue one. It might\r\nseem from this that a red glass put in front of a light would make it\r\nbetter for this purpose, but that is not the case, for the simple reason\r\nthat filtering the light through red glass does not really make it any\r\nredder than it was before: it simply makes it look redder by extracting\r\nfrom the original light all except the red. But a source of light which\r\nis _naturally_ reddish is so because it is more plentifully endowed with\r\nred rays, while a bluish light like the electric arc is naturally\r\ndeficient in red rays. Consequently we should be inclined to expect from\r\ntheory that the electric arc would not be a good light for a lighthouse,\r\nsince it would lack penetrating power in foggy weather. Some readers may\r\nhave noticed themselves, in towns where electric lights and gas lamps\r\nare in use near each other, that the latter, though relatively feebler\r\nunder normal conditions, seem to give more light in fog. And experiments\r\nshow that this is really the case. So although there are some\r\nlighthouses with electric arc lights, that which is now believed to be\r\nthe best is an oil lamp of special design, using a mantle of the\r\nWelsbach type.\r\n\r\nThe oil is stored in strong steel reservoirs into which air is pumped by\r\nmeans of a pump not unlike those used to inflate bicycle tyres. By this\r\nmeans a pressure is maintained upon the oil of about 65 lb. per square\r\ninch. This forces the oil up a pipe and drives it in a jet into a\r\nvaporiser, a tube heated from the outside so that in it the oil is\r\nturned into gas. This gas then rises to the burner and heats the mantle,\r\njust as the gas does in the ordinary incandescent gas light. Indeed in\r\nthe case of lights on the mainland near a town the gas from the town\r\nmain is often utilised. But this simple arrangement for using vaporised\r\noil, as will readily be seen, can be employed anywhere. A little of the\r\ngas produced is led through a branch pipe and burnt to heat the\r\nvaporiser. To start the apparatus the vaporiser is heated with a little\r\nmethylated spirit. Thus everything is quite self-contained and so simple\r\nthat there is little to get out of order. The largest size of lamp will\r\ngive 2400 candle-power, with an expenditure of 2-1/4 pints of oil per\r\nhour, just common oil, too, of the kind used with ordinary wick lamps.\r\n\r\nHaving got a source of powerful light, the next thing is to collect that\r\nlight and throw it in the direction required. For the light proceeds\r\nfrom the lamp in all directions (practically), and much of it would be\r\nentirely wasted could it not be collected and guided in the required\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe earliest attempt at this was to use a reflector of bright polished\r\nmetal. In the most improved form these were made to that peculiar curve\r\nknown as a parabola. This is a curve obtained by cutting a cone in a\r\ncertain way, wherefore it is one of the \"conic sections,\" and its\r\nparticular appropriateness for this work resides in the fact that if a\r\nlight be placed at a certain point known as the \"focus\" all the\r\ndiverging rays which fall upon the reflector will be reflected in the\r\nsame direction, parallel to each other. An ordinary spherical mirror\r\nwould reflect them either back to the lamp or in diverging directions.\r\n\r\nAt any distance the beam from the parabolic reflector will be more\r\nintense than that from the spherical one, since the rays will be closer\r\ntogether. But even with the parabolic one there is some diffusion, for\r\nthe simple reason that whereas the focus is a mathematical point\r\n(position without magnitude) the most concentrated form of light known\r\nhas a considerable magnitude. Hence the rays proceeding from the centre\r\nof the mantle are reflected as per the theory, but those from the\r\noutlying parts of it are somewhat diffused. This difficulty cannot\r\npossibly be overcome, and hence even in the finest examples of\r\nlighthouse architecture the flashes are not quite sharp and clear-cut.\r\nThere is a central moment, so to speak wherein the flash is almost\r\nblinding in its intensity, but it is preceded by a period of growing\r\nbrightness and succeeded by one of decreasing light.\r\n\r\nIn the modern apparatus, however, metallic mirrors are entirely\r\ndispensed with, their place being taken by reflecting prisms of glass.\r\nThe metallic ones had to be continually rubbed to keep them clean, and\r\nthis soon dulled their brightness, while the glass prisms need only to\r\nbe wiped carefully, which operation has little effect upon their\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nIt may come as a surprise to some that reflecting prisms are possible.\r\nThe idea of refraction through a prism is quite familiar. Such forms the\r\nessential principle of the spectroscope. Refraction is explained to\r\nevery school child in order to account for the rainbow. But _reflection_\r\nby a piece of the clearest glass seems a contradiction in terms almost.\r\nYet it is only a question of shape. In some prisms the light is simply\r\nbent as it passes through. In others it is bent twice, so that it leaves\r\nthe prism just as if it had been reflected off a mirror. Both devices\r\nare used in the lighthouse. Let us see how they are combined so as to\r\nperform the work to be done.\r\n\r\nTake first of all the case of a light upon an isolated rock where the\r\nwarning is needed equally all round. All that is necessary here is to\r\npick up those rays which, if left to themselves, would fall upon the\r\nwater near the foot of the tower, and those which would waste themselves\r\nskywards, and then to gather all the rays into several bundles or beams.\r\nWe will suppose a simple case in which the light is supposed to give\r\nflashes at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nWe are in the topmost room of the lighthouse, the lantern, as it is\r\ncalled. In the centre there stands the murette or pedestal. In this\r\nseveral columns support a circular platform on the top of which there\r\nmoves what we might call a turntable, which in turn bears a frame of\r\ngun-metal into which are fitted a maze of glass bars triangular in\r\nsection and curved to form concentric circles. The whole structure,\r\npossibly, is of great size. From the floor to the platform is as high as\r\nan ordinary man. Indeed around the turntable there is a gallery which\r\nforms a roof over our heads, so that it is only after mounting some iron\r\nsteps on to this gallery that we are able to examine the glass part.\r\n\r\nAs we ascend we notice that the walls of the chamber as far up as the\r\ngallery are formed of iron plates, while above that there is a metal\r\nframework filled in with glass panes, and above all a dome-shaped roof.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the platform we proceed to examine the glass, and we find\r\nthat the metal framework forms a cage with four sides, each\r\napproximately flat, but really slightly spherical. Each of these sides\r\nis called a \"panel.\" In the centre of each is a lens. Peeping through\r\nthe interstices between the prisms, we perceive that the lamp is inside\r\nthis structure, exactly in the centre, so that its light shines\r\ndirectly through the central lens or bull's eye. Around this bull's-eye\r\nare many circles of glass bar, forming refracting prisms. Around this\r\nagain are more bars in the form of segments, which together form\r\ncircles, some being refracting prisms and others reflecting prisms. All\r\nthe light rays from the lamp which fall on any one prism are deflected,\r\nso that they proceed approximately in the same direction. Those prisms\r\nin the upper part lay hold of the rays which would otherwise go up into\r\nthe sky. Those at the bottom collect those which would fall near the\r\nfoot of the tower. So scarcely any are lost. But for the fact that the\r\nlamp itself is comparatively large and not a theoretical point, as\r\nalready explained, the beam from this panel would be perfectly straight,\r\nparallel, and of uniform density everywhere. As it is, it widens\r\nslightly as it proceeds, but, practically speaking, we might call it a\r\nsolid beam of light.\r\n\r\nEach of the panels sends forth such a beam, so that they strike out in\r\nfour directions from the central lamp much as four spokes from the hub\r\nof a wheel.\r\n\r\nThen descending once more to the floor from which we started, we see\r\nthat among the columns there is a large clockwork arrangement, the\r\npurpose of which is to drive round the turntable and all that it\r\ncarries--in the language of the lighthouse engineer the \"optical\r\napparatus\" or, more briefly, \"the apparatus.\" And as this turns the\r\nradiating beams of light sweep round the horizon and in succession\r\nstrike into the eyes of any mariner who may be within range. Each time a\r\nbeam strikes him he sees a flash. If the apparatus revolve once a minute\r\nhe will see four flashes every minute, one from each panel.\r\n\r\nLet us consider, then, the advantages of this wonderful mechanism, with\r\nits cunning arrangement of prisms. It is these latter, of course, which\r\nare the important thing. The rest, the mechanical portion, is simply for\r\nthe purpose of holding them and turning them at the proper speed. In the\r\nfirst place, the contrivance gives us flashes instead of a steady light;\r\nit gives the lighthouse its \"character.\" Then again it enhances the\r\nbrightness of the light. Instead of shining all round, the light is\r\nconcentrated in four special directions, and the light which would be\r\nwasted upwards or downwards is saved and brought into use.\r\n\r\nBut suppose that the lighthouse we are considering be near the shore, so\r\nthat there is no need for it to throw any light in one--the\r\nlandward--direction. Then we should see inside the revolving framework\r\nwith its prisms a fixed frame with reflecting prisms which would catch\r\nany rays going from the lamp in the direction of the land and simply\r\nhurl them, as it were, back into the flame. Thus the intensity of the\r\nflame becomes increased by those rays thrown back which would else have\r\nbeen wasted.\r\n\r\nOr suppose that the character of the light is such that the flashes have\r\nto be at irregular intervals. Then the framework, instead of being\r\nsymmetrically four-sided, would be of an irregular shape.\r\n\r\nAnd that brings us to a beautiful feature of the mechanism of the\r\napparatus. We have been discussing a four-panel arrangement. Suppose\r\nthat we were to reduce it to three. Then, since all the light would be\r\nconcentrated into three beams instead of four, each beam would be more\r\nintense. We should thereby have increased the range of our apparatus\r\nwithout any increase in the cost of oil--for nothing, as it were. But to\r\nget the same number of flashes per minute we should have to drive it\r\nround so much the faster. But increased speed means increased burden on\r\nthe keepers who have to wind up the heavy weights which operate the\r\nclockwork. So there is a limit to the speed which can be attained.\r\n\r\nBut if friction can be almost eliminated the apparatus can revolve at a\r\nhigh speed without throwing undue burden upon the men. But how can\r\nfriction thus be got rid of? Messrs Chance Bros., the great lighthouse\r\nconstructors, of Birmingham, have done it, almost entirely, by floating\r\nthe apparatus on mercury. The turntable has on its under side a large\r\nring which nearly fits a cast-iron trough on the top of the pedestal.\r\nIn this trough there is mercury, so that upon the liquid metal the\r\napparatus floats as if upon a circular raft. The table with its lenses,\r\nprisms and other fittings may weigh six or seven tons, yet it can be\r\npushed round by one finger.\r\n\r\nThe various sizes of optical apparatus are known as \"orders.\" One of the\r\n\"first order\" has a focal distance of 920 millimetres. This means that\r\nthere is that distance between the centre of the lamp and the\r\nbull's-eye. They descend by successive stages down to the sixth order,\r\nwith a focal distance of 150 millimetres, while the most important\r\nlights are of an order superior even to the so-called \"first,\" termed\r\nthe \"hyper-radial,\" the focal distance of which is 1330 millimetres.\r\n\r\nA recent example of a hyper-radial light is at the well-known Cape Race\r\nin Newfoundland. It revolves once every 30 seconds, giving a flash of 3\r\nseconds every 7-1/2 seconds. The optical apparatus weighs seven tons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_By permission of Messrs. Chance Bros. and Co., Ltd., Birmingham_\r\n\r\n               DASSEN ISLAND LIGHTHOUSE, CAPE OF GOOD HOPE\r\n\r\n     This lighthouse, 80 feet high, is built of cast-iron plates,\r\n                           bolted together]\r\n\r\nMost lighthouses are fitted with fog signals of some kind which have a\r\ndistinctive character the same as the lights. Some are horns blown at\r\nintervals by compressed air often obtained from a special air-pump\r\ndriven by an oil-engine. Another thing is to let off detonators at\r\nstated intervals. But perhaps the most interesting of all is the\r\nsubmarine telephone. The trouble with audible signals is that they are\r\napt to vary as the conditions of the atmosphere change. For, strange\r\nthough it may appear, the air which is the natural medium by which\r\nsounds are carried to our ears is really a very bad substance for the\r\npurpose. Water is much superior. A swimmer who cares to try the\r\nexperiment of lying upon the water with his ears immersed while a friend\r\nbeats a gong under the water some distance off will be astounded at the\r\nresult. So many modern ships are fitted with under-water ears,\r\nwaterproof telephone receivers, really. One is fixed each side of the\r\nvessel, the wires from them being led to telephone receivers near the\r\nbridge. Many lighthouses and lightships in like manner are fitted\r\nwith under-water bells which can be rung at intervals. The sounds so\r\nconveyed through the water are always the same. Atmospheric or similar\r\nchanges have no effect upon them. And, moreover, the officer can tell\r\nwhich side of his ship the bell is. If it be on his port-side it sounds\r\nlouder in his port telephone, and vice versa. By turning his ship until\r\nhe hears them equally he knows that he is pointing directly to or from\r\nthe bell. Thus if the bell belong to a warning light he can steer\r\nconfidently right away from the danger even in the thickest fog.\r\n\r\nBut science has not only provided the mariner with lights of marvellous\r\npower and of strange distinctive characters, and reliable sound-signals\r\nfor foggy weather, it has also found him a reliable compass, but that is\r\nworthy of a chapter to itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE GYRO-COMPASS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe magnetic compass has been for ages the mariner's guide over the\r\ntrackless waters. In cloudy weather it has been his only means of\r\nknowing the direction in which his craft was heading. Indeed, it is not\r\ntoo much to say that the maritime commerce of the world was based upon\r\nthe behaviour of that little piece of magnetised steel.\r\n\r\nIt has always, however, been subject to certain faults. To commence\r\nwith, it points, not to the geographical north, but to the \"magnetic\r\npole,\" a point some distance from the geographical pole, and one,\r\nmoreover, which is not quite permanent. The fact that the magnetic pole\r\nvaries its position is impressively shown by the fact that a special\r\ndepartment at Greenwich Observatory is continually employed, by the aid\r\nof delicate self-recording instruments, watching and setting down its\r\nfluctuations. And the premier observatory of the world, it should be\r\nremembered, exists primarily, not in the interests of pure science, but\r\nas a department of the British Admiralty in order to study matters of\r\ninterest to navigation. Thus we have testimony to the importance of\r\nthese little vagaries on the part of the magnetic compass.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to these inherent faults there is a new source of error\r\nin the magnetic compass which man has introduced himself by making his\r\nships of iron instead of wood. Every ship of the present day is a huge\r\nmagnet. A piece of iron left in the same position for a length of time\r\nbecomes polarised, which is to say that it acquires the properties of a\r\nmagnet; and two magnets always exert an influence upon each other.\r\nConsequently the ship, after lying for perhaps a year in one position,\r\nduring the period of building, becomes itself magnetic and interferes\r\nwith its own compass.\r\n\r\nThen, again, our methods of ship construction aggravate this trouble. It\r\nis believed that every molecule of iron is itself a minute magnet with a\r\nnorth and south pole of its own. These lying in confusion in the mass of\r\nunmagnetised iron neutralise each other, so that the mass, taken as a\r\nwhole, does not exhibit any magnetic power. But if by some means the\r\nwhole of the millions of millions of molecules can be set the same\r\nway--with all their north poles in one direction, and their south poles\r\nin the opposite direction--then they will all act together. Instead of\r\nneutralising each other they will then help each other, and under those\r\nconditions the mass of iron will possess that peculiar power which is\r\ndistinctive of a magnet. So long as a piece of iron is left in the same\r\nposition the magnetism of the earth is thus acting upon the molecules.\r\nJust as it tends to place the compass needle north and south, so it does\r\nwith every molecule in the iron mass. And if, while lying still, the\r\niron be hammered, the shaking of the molecules due to the hammering\r\nloosens them as it were and assists the earth's power in pulling them\r\ninto position.\r\n\r\nOne has only, then, to watch the riveting up of a ship, and to see the\r\nvigorous way in which the riveters wield their hammers, to realise that\r\nwhen the thousands or even millions of rivets have all been finished the\r\nmaterial of that ship will have had the very best possible chance of\r\nbecoming magnetic.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse still, ships are often loaded with great weights\r\nof iron among their cargo. That, too, may affect the compass. On\r\nwarships there are the heavy guns, each weighing, with its turret,\r\nhundreds of tons, and they move, so that their effect upon the compass\r\nis not always the same, but may vary from time to time. And finally one\r\nmay mention the electrical machinery in a modern ship consisting largely\r\nof powerful magnets.\r\n\r\nAltogether, then, it is not surprising that the old magnetic compass is\r\nsomewhat unreliable. It has to be coaxed into doing its duty. Pieces of\r\niron and magnets have to be disposed about it to counteract these\r\ndisturbing influences with which it is surrounded. Before a voyage\r\nexperts have to come on board to adjust the compasses, and even then\r\nthere is reason to believe that the instrument sometimes plays the ship\r\nfalse.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at, then, that the naval authorities in\r\nparticular throughout the world have welcomed the advent of a new\r\ncompass which appears to possess none of these drawbacks. It points to\r\nthe geographical north, to the actual pivot, if one may so speak, upon\r\nwhich the earth turns. It is non-magnetic, so that the presence of iron\r\nor magnets even in its immediate neighbourhood has little or no effect\r\nupon it. On the other hand, it has to be driven by a current of\r\nelectricity, and it seems just possible that in some great crisis it\r\nmight fail, although every provision is made for alternative sources of\r\nsupply in case of one failing, and there is always the possibility of\r\nfalling back upon the old magnetic compass should the new one go wrong.\r\n\r\nIn principle the improved compass is, like its older brother, simplicity\r\nitself. The latter is but a small piece of iron magnetised; the former\r\nis nothing more than a spinning-top.\r\n\r\nIt is rather strange that although the spinning object has been a\r\nfamiliar toy for years, and that, moreover, its behaviour has been the\r\nsubject of investigation by some very eminent scientific men, it is only\r\nof recent years that its principles have been put to practical use.\r\n\r\nEveryone is familiar with the fact that a round block of wood will\r\nsupport itself upon a comparatively tall peg so long as it is rapidly\r\nrotating. And that is but one of the curious things which a rotating\r\nbody will do. For example, imagine a wheel mounted upon an axle the ends\r\nof which are supported inside a ring, while the ring again is supported\r\non pivots between the two prongs of a fork, the fork being free to\r\nswivel round in a socket. The wheel is then free to move in any\r\ndirection. Technically, it is said to have \"three degrees of freedom.\"\r\nIt can spin round, its axle can turn over and over with the pivoted ring\r\ninside which it is fixed, while it can also swing round and round as the\r\nfork turns in its socket. Assuming that the joints are all perfectly\r\nfree, that the pivots move in their sockets with perfect freedom--which,\r\nof course, they do not--then a wheel so mounted could move in any\r\ndirection under the influence of any force that might act upon it. Now a\r\nwheel so mounted if left alone remains in precisely the same position so\r\nlong as it goes on rotating. If it be turning sufficiently quickly its\r\ntendency to remain will be strong enough to overcome the friction of any\r\nordinarily well-made instrument. Consequently a wheel of that\r\ndescription has been used to demonstrate the rotation of the earth, it\r\nremaining still (except, of course, for its rotating movement) while the\r\nearth has moved under it.\r\n\r\nCould we entirely eliminate the effects of friction that might be used\r\nas a compass, for it could be set, say with its axle pointing north and\r\nsouth, at the commencement of the voyage, and it would remain so despite\r\nall the evolutions through which the ship might go.\r\n\r\nBut there is a better scheme even than that, based upon the peculiar\r\nbehaviour of a revolving wheel when it has only two degrees of freedom.\r\nSuppose that we dispense with the ring employed in the previous\r\narrangement, pivoting the ends of the axle between the prongs of the\r\nfork. The wheel is then free to rotate, and its axle can slew round\r\nthrough a complete circle by the turning of the fork in its socket, but\r\nthere can be no tilting of the axle. Being thus deprived of one of its\r\nmovements the gyroscope with three degrees becomes a gyroscope with two\r\ndegrees of freedom, and in that form it supplies the need for an\r\nefficient and reliable compass.\r\n\r\nThe secret of the whole thing is the curious fact that a gyroscope with\r\ntwo degrees of freedom exhibits a keen desire to place its axis parallel\r\nwith the axis of the earth. Owing to the shape of the earth, a device\r\nsuch as has been described, with its fork standing up vertically, cannot\r\npossibly have its axis really parallel with that of the earth, except on\r\nthe Equator. Still it gets as nearly parallel as possible. To be\r\nscientifically accurate, we ought to say that it places it own axis \"in\r\nthe same plane\" as that of the earth.\r\n\r\nTo understand this we need to realise that all movement is relative. In\r\nordinary language, when we say a thing is still we mean that it is still\r\nin relation to the surface of the earth, but since the earth is moving\r\nthe stillest thing, apparently, is really travelling at enormous speed.\r\n\r\nSaint Paul's Cathedral in London, or a tall sky-scraper in New York,\r\nwould usually be regarded as supreme instances of immobility. It would\r\nbe hard to find better examples of stationariness, as we ordinarily look\r\nat things. Each stands, firm and strong, upon a horizontal base. Yet\r\neach is really turning a somersault every twenty-four hours. The plateau\r\nupon which St Paul's stands, though it seems still and motionless\r\nbeneath our feet, is continually tilting; its eastern edge is\r\ncontinually going downwards and its western edge upwards, as the earth\r\nperforms its daily spin. It is only a north and south line which does\r\nnot share in some degree this continual tilting action. Every plane,\r\nlarge or small, so long as it remains horizontal, is being tilted thus,\r\ndown at the eastern edge and up at the western. And the plane in which\r\nthe axle of a gyroscope with \"two degrees\" is free to move is a\r\nhorizontal plane. Owing to its being held between the prongs of the\r\nfork, while it can swing round to point north, south, east or west, or\r\ntowards any point between them, it cannot deviate from the horizontal\r\nplane. Therefore such axle is always being tilted by the motion of the\r\nearth, _except when it happens to be lying exactly north and south_.\r\n\r\nNow for a reason which is too complex to go into here a gyroscope\r\nstrongly objects to having its axle tilted in this manner. If it be\r\ncompelled by superior force to submit to tilting, it tries to wrench\r\nitself round sideways. Anyone who has a gyroscope top and cares to try\r\nthe experiment will feel this action quite easily. Hold the spinning-top\r\nin your hand and turn it over so as to tilt the axle, when it will, if\r\nyou are not careful, twist itself out of your grasp.\r\n\r\nSo a gyroscope of the kind we are considering, when the motion of the\r\nearth tilts its axis, turns itself round in its socket until at last it\r\nreaches the north and south position, when the tilting, and therefore\r\nthe twisting, ceases. Hence the axle of the gyroscope if left to itself\r\n(the rotation of the wheel being maintained the while) will place itself\r\nin a north and south direction. And, moreover, it will keep in that\r\ndirection. It will take some force to slew it round into any other. And\r\nif moved into any other by some extraneous means it will restore itself\r\nto the old position again.\r\n\r\nHence a wheel thus arranged has all the attributes which we need for a\r\nmariner's compass. But unfortunately there are mechanical difficulties\r\nin the way of using such a simple contrivance for that purpose.\r\n\r\nChief of all these is the fact that it is not what engineers call\r\n\"dead-beat.\" That means that it will not go to the proper position and\r\nthen remain there quite still. Instead, it will first slightly overshoot\r\nthe mark, which being followed by the reverse action, it will come back\r\nand overshoot it just as far in the opposite direction. Instead,\r\ntherefore, of a steady pointing, always in the same direction precisely,\r\nit will oscillate more or less, the exact north and south line being the\r\nmean or average position, the centre of the oscillations.\r\n\r\nIt would of course be possible to damp this, to apply a break as it\r\nwere, if the apparatus were to remain stationary. For example, if the\r\nwhole concern were immersed in water the resistance of the liquid would\r\nrestrain any quick movement of the axle, yet it would not prevent it\r\nfrom slowly finding its true position. Thus the oscillations would be\r\nreduced to such a small range as to be for practical purposes\r\nnegligible. But the drawback to a device of that kind, applied to a\r\ngyroscope on board ship, would be that the axle would be carried round\r\nto some extent every time the ship turned. As she changed direction it\r\nwould more or less carry round the water with it; that in turn would\r\ncarry the gyroscope, and so the direction of the latter would be for a\r\ntime untrue. It would in course of time regain its accuracy, but in the\r\nmeantime it would be leading the ship astray.\r\n\r\nConsequently the application of this, in itself wonderfully simple,\r\nidea, to this extremely important purpose was accompanied with a\r\ndifficulty which was for a long time insuperable.\r\n\r\nBut all was overcome at last by the genius of Dr Anschutz, of Hamburg,\r\nwhose firm were the first to turn out the practicable article. Taking\r\nadvantage of another movement of the gyroscope when arranged as has been\r\ndescribed, and using the revolving wheel itself as a centrifugal fan, he\r\nwas able to make the wheel blow air \"against itself,\" as it were, when\r\nin any position other than north and south. Thus, if it deviates towards\r\nthe east, this jet of air tends to blow it back; if it turns westwards\r\nthe jet again comes into operation, tending to bring the erring gyro\r\nback to its proper place; and so the tendency to oscillate is checked.\r\n\r\nThe finished instrument as it is installed on the latest warships is, of\r\ncourse, quite different in detail from the simple contrivance which we\r\nhave been considering so far, although it is the same precisely in\r\nprinciple. The essential part is a heavy metal wheel combined with which\r\nis an electric motor which keeps it rotating at a speed of 20,000 or so\r\ntimes per minute.\r\n\r\nThe bearings of the wheel are supported upon a metal ring which floats\r\nupon the surface of a trough of mercury. Thus friction is brought down\r\nalmost to the irreducible minimum. The only place where the wheel and\r\nits supports touch anything solid is at one delicately made pivot which\r\nserves to keep the floating mechanism in the centre of the mercury\r\nbasin, and to prevent it from rubbing against the side of it. The\r\ncurrent which drives the motor reaches it through this pivot and leaves\r\nthrough the mercury. Thus arranged, although the floating part is of\r\nconsiderable weight, a very slight force indeed is enough to move it;\r\nwhile, looking at it the other way, we can see that the ship might turn\r\nrapidly to right or to left, carrying round the mercury bowl with it,\r\nwithout turning the floating part at all. Thus the gyroscopic action is\r\nvery free indeed to exercise its function of keeping the contrivance\r\npointing always in the one way.\r\n\r\nThe float has mounted upon it a compass card much like that of the\r\nordinary magnetic instrument, and the sailor reads it in precisely the\r\nsame way. To outward appearance there is little essential difference; in\r\none case there is a magnet under the card to keep it still, in the other\r\nthere is the float with the revolving wheel mounted upon it.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to have one \"master compass\" of this kind on a ship,\r\nwith an electrical repeater in each of the steering positions. As the\r\n\"master\" turns in its casing it sends a rapid series of currents to all\r\nthe others, causing them to turn in unison with it. The \"master\" is\r\nfitted in some safe part of the ship where it is least likely to be the\r\nvictim of any accidental damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTORPEDOES AND SUBMARINE MINES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is sad to think how much scientific skill and learning has, during\r\nthe Great War, been devoted to killing people. It used to be thought\r\nthat one day a great scientific invention would arise, of such deadly\r\npower that for ever afterwards war would be unthinkable; its horrors\r\nwould be such that all nations would shrink from it. That prophecy,\r\nhowever, has not been fulfilled, nor are there any signs of it. On the\r\ncontrary, each scientific achievement in the realm of warfare is quickly\r\ncountered by another: so much so that with all our science in the\r\nmanufacture of weapons, and our skill in using them, warfare in the\r\ntwentieth century is if anything less deadly in proportion to the\r\nnumbers engaged than it used to be.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two weapons which in this war have reached a deadly\r\nefficiency which they did not seem to possess before, and to which\r\nsatisfactory antidotes have not yet appeared.\r\n\r\nThese two are the submarine mine and the torpedo. The latter,\r\nparticularly, had been a dismal failure previously, but as the weapon of\r\nthe submarine it has now established itself. It is, however, only in\r\nconnection with the submarine that it has achieved any measure of\r\nsuccess, and, as there are strong indications that very soon the\r\nsubmarine itself will be robbed of its terrors, it is quite likely that\r\nthe reign of the torpedo will be brief.\r\n\r\nAlthough it has only just made itself felt seriously in warfare, the\r\ntorpedo is a fairly old idea. In fact we can trace the general idea of\r\nit back to very ancient times. The modern weapon, however, dates from\r\nthe year 1864, when an Austrian inventor approached an English engineer\r\nnamed Whitehead with a request to take up his idea. Mr Whitehead had at\r\nthat time a works at Fiume, on the Adriatic, and it was really his\r\ngenius that developed the crude idea into a practicable invention.\r\n\r\nThus there came into existence the Whitehead Torpedo, now used in a\r\ngreat many navies, and also the Schwartzkopff, which may be regarded as\r\nthe German variety of the same thing.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, it may be described as a small automatic submarine\r\nboat. Externally, it naturally follows somewhat the lines of a fish.\r\nDeriving its name from that curious fish which is able to give electric\r\nshocks from its snout, it likewise carries on its nose that appliance\r\nwhereby it gives a shock, not electric it is true, but equally deadly,\r\nto anything which it may touch.\r\n\r\nSince no man-made mechanism can approach the marvellous action of the\r\nfish's fins and tail, the propulsion is achieved by a propeller like\r\nthat of a steamboat, but of course on a very small scale. A single\r\npropeller, however, would tend to turn the torpedo over and over in the\r\nwater, and so it has two, one behind the other, driven in opposite ways,\r\nso that the turning tendency of one is neutralised by that of the other.\r\nThe blades of the propellers are, however, set in opposite ways, so that\r\nalthough rotating in different directions they both push the torpedo\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nBehind the propellers, again, there are rudders for steering. One steers\r\nto right or left, as does that of an ordinary ship, while two others are\r\nso placed that they can steer upwards and downwards.\r\n\r\nSo there we have the general picture of the outside: a smooth, fish-like\r\nbody with a \"sting\" in its nose, propellers at the rear to drive it\r\nalong, and rudders to guide it.\r\n\r\nInside are various chambers. One contains the explosive which blows up\r\nwhen the nose strikes something. This \"head,\" as it is termed, is\r\ndetachable, so that it can be left off until it is really required for\r\nwar. The peace-head, which is of the same size, shape and weight as the\r\nwar-head, is what the torpedo carries during its earlier career. With\r\nthis it can be tried and tested in safety, the war-head being\r\nsubstituted when the real business of the torpedo begins.\r\n\r\nAnother chamber contains the compressed air which furnishes the motive\r\npower. This also serves to give buoyancy.\r\n\r\nAnother chamber, again, contains the engines, beautiful little things of\r\nthe finest workmanship almost exactly like the finest steam-engine, but\r\nof course very small in comparison.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages the range of the torpedo was limited by the amount\r\nof compressed air which it could carry. At first sight there seems no\r\nreason why any limit should be placed upon this, but in practice there\r\nare often limitations in engineering matters which are not apparent on\r\nthe surface. For example, to increase the air chamber would mean\r\nenlarging the whole torpedo, calling for more propulsive power and\r\nlarger engines, and these larger engines would call for more air, thus\r\ndefeating the object in view. Forcing more air in by using a higher\r\npressure, in a similar way would necessitate a thicker chamber, to\r\nresist the higher pressure. This would add weight, calling for more\r\nbuoyancy. Thus there seemed to be a practical limit beyond which it was\r\nimpossible to go.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty was overcome, however, in a very cunning way. When the\r\nengines have used some of the air, and the store is somewhat exhausted,\r\nchemicals come into action which generate heat, which is imparted to the\r\nair which is left. This heat expands the air, producing in effect a\r\nlarger supply of it, and enabling the torpedo to make a longer journey.\r\n\r\nSteering in a horizontal direction--that is to say, to left or right--is\r\ndone by a gyroscope. The action of a rotating wheel is discussed in the\r\nlast chapter, and it is not necessary here to say more than this: a\r\nrotating wheel always tries to keep its axle pointed in the same\r\ndirection. Just at the moment of starting such a wheel is set going\r\ninside the torpedo, and its arrangement is such that, should the torpedo\r\nswerve to the left, the gyroscope operates the rudder and steers it\r\nback. In the same way, if it tends to turn to the right, the\r\never-watchful gyroscope brings it to its true course once more. The\r\neffect of the gyroscope, therefore, acting upon the rudder, is to keep\r\nthe torpedo faithfully to the direction upon which it is started.\r\n\r\nThe up and down rudders are likewise controlled quite automatically, but\r\nin a different way. Their function, clearly, is to keep the thing at a\r\ncertain uniform level. Without such control a torpedo would be equally\r\nlikely to jump out of the water altogether, or to go downwards\r\nvertically and bury its nose in the mud. The depth at which it is to\r\nmove is determined beforehand, certain necessary adjustments are made,\r\nand the torpedo then pursues its even way, neither coming to the surface\r\nnor driving beneath its target.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose there is first of all a \"hydrostatic valve.\" This\r\nlittle appliance, which is open to the action of the water, responds to\r\nchanges in pressure. The pressure at any point under water is exactly\r\nproportional to the depth. At ten feet, for example, it is precisely ten\r\ntimes what it is at one foot. So the hydrostatic valve is adjusted to\r\nset the rudders straight when the water-pressure upon it is a certain\r\namount. If, then, it dives downwards the pressure increases and the\r\nvalve operates the rudders so as to bring it upwards, while if it rise\r\ntoo high the decrease of pressure causes it to be guided downwards.\r\n\r\nThis action, however, is too sudden and violent, so that with it alone\r\nthe torpedo would proceed by leaps and bounds. After being low it would\r\ncome up too suddenly, overshoot the mark, only to be steered downwards\r\nagain equally suddenly.\r\n\r\nThe valve, therefore, is combined with a pendulum, whose action tends to\r\nrestrain these too sudden changes, with the result that under the\r\ninfluence of the two things combined the torpedo keeps fairly well to\r\nan even course, only varying upwards or downwards to an extent which is\r\nnegligible.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is an interesting little feature about the firing\r\nmechanism which merits a description. The actual firing is caused by the\r\ndriving in of a little pin which projects at the nose of the torpedo.\r\nSuppose that, in the process of pointing the torpedo and launching it\r\nupon its course, that pin were to be knocked accidentally, an awful\r\ndisaster would result. It must be provided against, therefore, and the\r\nmethod adopted is beautiful in its certainty and simplicity.\r\n\r\nNormally, the firing-pin is fixed by a screw so securely that no\r\naccidental firing is possible. There is, however, a little\r\npropeller-like object associated with it, which is driven round by the\r\nwater as the torpedo is pushed through it, and this unscrews, and\r\nthereby releases the pin. The little \"fan\" has to rotate a certain\r\nnumber of times before the pin is released, and it is quite impossible\r\nfor this number to be accomplished before the torpedo has proceeded to a\r\nsafe distance from the ship which fires it. On board the ship,\r\ntherefore, and so long as it is near the ship, it is quite safe, but by\r\nthe time it reaches its target it is ready to explode.\r\n\r\nAs far as is known, the foregoing description gives a true general\r\ndescription of the torpedoes now in use. Those of different powers may\r\nvary in detail, but, broadly, they are as just described.\r\n\r\nThere are others, however. The Brennan, for instance, was once adopted\r\nand largely used by the British for harbour defence. This was controlled\r\nfrom the shore by wires. It was driven, so to speak, with wire reins,\r\nand thus guided it could fairly hunt down its prey, turning to right and\r\nto left as required.\r\n\r\nOf greater scientific interest, perhaps, still, is the \"Armor1\" wireless\r\ncontrolled torpedo. This is the invention of two gentlemen, Messrs\r\nArmstrong and Orling, whose first syllables combine to form the title of\r\nthe torpedo.\r\n\r\nOf this, two very interesting features may be mentioned. Firstly, the\r\nwireless control. In the chapter on Wireless Telegraphy there is\r\ndescribed the coherer, a simple little apparatus which we might describe\r\nas a door which is opened by the \"waves\" which travel through the ether\r\nfrom the sending apparatus. Whenever the key of the sending apparatus is\r\ndepressed these waves travel forth, and when they fall upon the coherer\r\nit \"opens.\" Normally, the coherer is shut, but when acted upon by the\r\nincoming waves it opens and lets through current from a battery, which\r\ncurrent can be caused to perform any duty which we may wish. Thus,\r\nignoring the intermediate steps, we get this: whenever the sending key\r\nis depressed current flows through the coherer and performs whatever\r\nduty is set before it.\r\n\r\nAnd now picture to yourself a tooth wheel with four teeth. A catch\r\nnormally holds one of the teeth, but when the catch is lifted for a\r\nmoment it lets that tooth slip and the next one is caught. At every\r\nlifting of the catch the wheel turns a quarter of a turn. Then imagine\r\nthat that catch is operated by an electro-magnet energised by the\r\ncurrent which passes through the coherer. We see, then, that every time\r\nthe sending key is depressed the wheel turns a quarter turn.\r\n\r\nAttached to the wheel is a little crank which turns with it, and the pin\r\nof this crank fits in a slot in the end of a bar like the tiller of a\r\nboat. Suppose that, to commence with, the tiller is straight, so as to\r\nsteer the boat straight. Depress the key, the wheel turns a quarter turn\r\nand the tiller is set so as to steer to one side, say the left. Another\r\npressure upon the key and a second quarter turn brings the tiller\r\nstraight again. Yet another pressure, another quarter turn, and the\r\ntiller is steering to the right. Thus by simply pressing the key the\r\ncorrect number of times the torpedo can be made to travel in any desired\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe second ingenious feature of this weapon is the means by which it is\r\nmade visible to the man who is controlling it from the shore or ship.\r\nProbably the reason why these torpedoes are not used more is that the\r\nman who guides them is of necessity himself visible. He has to be posted\r\nsomewhere where he can follow its course, or he has no idea how to steer\r\nit. Consequently, he would be an object for attack by the enemy. Such a\r\ntorpedo would be useless in a submarine, for the submarine would need to\r\ncome to the surface in order that the observer might get a sufficiently\r\ngood view to be able to steer the torpedo, and we all know that when\r\nupon the surface a submarine is a very vulnerable craft.\r\n\r\nBut that is by the way. The point is how to make the torpedo very\r\nclearly visible while it is still under water. A short mast might be\r\nused, but that would be liable to be shot away. The inventor had a happy\r\ninspiration when he made it blow up a jet of water, like a whale does.\r\nThis jet is quite easy to see, yet no shot can destroy it. Compressed\r\nair blows up this tell-tale jet which the observer can see, and by its\r\nmeans he can guide the torpedo at will.\r\n\r\nA submarine mine may be regarded as a stationary torpedo. It consists of\r\na metal case filled with a powerful charge of explosive which floats\r\nharmlessly in the water until some unfortunate vessel strikes against\r\nit, when it blows up with sufficient force to make a hole in the\r\nstoutest ship.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of mine: one which is laid in peace time, to\r\nprotect harbours and channels; and the other, which is laid during\r\nactual warfare.\r\n\r\nThe former are anchored in a more or less permanent way. The services of\r\ndivers are used to place them in position. In some cases they float well\r\ndown in the water, out of the way of passing ships, but come up nearer\r\nthe surface when needed. This result is achieved by having an anchor\r\nchain of such a length that when fully extended the mine floats a little\r\nway under the surface, just high enough to be struck by a passing ship,\r\ntogether with what is called an \"explosive link.\" The link is used to\r\nloop together two parts of the chain, and so, in effect, to reduce its\r\nlength. Wires pass from the link to the shore, and when an electric\r\ncurrent is sent along these wires the link bursts asunder, liberates\r\nthe chain, and the mine floats up to the full length of its chain.\r\n\r\nAnother plan is to let the mines float high up always, but to fire them,\r\nnot by the touch of the ship but by electricity from the shore. In this\r\nway a safe channel is kept for friendly vessels, while an enemy can be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nNecessarily, those mines which are hurriedly laid in war time are very\r\ndifferent from these. To be of much use, a mine must be concealed below\r\nthe surface. If it floats upon the water it will be visible, and can be\r\navoided, or, at all events, easily picked up. It is practically\r\nimpossible to set a floating object at a certain depth in the water,\r\nexcept by anchoring it to another, heavier, object, which will lie at\r\nthe bottom. Therefore mines have to be anchored in some way.\r\n\r\nBut the sea varies in depth, so that the length of the anchor chain must\r\nbe varied, or else some of the mines will be on the surface, thereby\r\nadvertising the presence of the mine-field, while others will be below\r\nthe depth of even the biggest ship. In warfare, however, mines need to\r\nbe laid quickly. There is no time to sound for the depth and then to\r\nadjust the length of cable accordingly. Hence the mine must be so made\r\nas to set itself correctly at a pre-determined depth.\r\n\r\nPossibly some readers may think that such things might be made to float,\r\nof themselves, at the right depth. It is a fact, however, that a thing\r\neither floats upon the surface of water or falls to the bottom. Water is\r\npractically incompressible, so that the water at the bottom of the sea\r\nis no heavier than that near the surface. The conditions which prevail\r\nin air and allow a balloon to float at any desired height do not apply.\r\nThe only thing, in this case, is to have an anchor chain or rope of the\r\nright length.\r\n\r\nSo let us picture a mine-laying ship steaming along, probably in the\r\ndead of night, surreptitiously laying mines in the hope that the enemy\r\nwill run into them on the morrow.\r\n\r\nAlong the deck of the ship are small railway lines, and on these lines\r\nstand what appear to be trains of small trucks, each truck having small\r\nwheels to run on, and each bearing a large round metal ball. As the ship\r\ntravels along, the crew, handling these deadly things quite freely, as\r\nif they were innocent of any danger, propel them along to the stern, and\r\nat regular intervals push one overboard. That is all.\r\n\r\nThe freedom with which the men handle them is not folly, for they are\r\nthen quite harmless. Nor need they trouble about the length of rope, for\r\nthat adjusts itself. Just tumble the things overboard, and in due time\r\nthey anchor themselves at the right depth and set themselves in the\r\nright condition for blowing up any ship which may get amongst them.\r\n\r\nThe truck-like object upon wheels is not the mine itself: it is the\r\nsinker which lies at the bottom of the sea. The round ball which it\r\nbears is the mine, and the two are connected together by a wire rope. To\r\ncommence with, this rope is coiled upon a drum in the sinker, which drum\r\nis either held tightly or is free to revolve according to the position\r\nof a catch. That catch is held open, so that the drum is free, by a\r\nweight at the end of a short rope. Let us assume that that rope is ten\r\nfeet long.\r\n\r\nThen, when the whole thing is tumbled into the water, the weight sinks\r\nfirst ten feet below the sinker, which, being more bulky in proportion\r\nto its weight, follows downwards more slowly. While sinking, the weight\r\nis pulling upon its rope and holding open that catch, so that the drum\r\npays out its rope and the mine lies serenely upon the surface. As soon\r\nas the weight touches bottom, however, the pull on the short rope\r\nceases, the catch grips the drum, no more rope is paid out, and the\r\nsinker, in settling down its last ten feet, has to drag the mine down\r\ntoo. Thus, quite automatically, by what is really a beautifully simple\r\narrangement, the mine becomes automatically anchored at a depth below\r\nthe surface equal to the length of the short rope. By making that rope\r\nthe desired length, the depth of the mine under the water can be fixed.\r\n\r\nThere are various methods of firing these mines, all of which work\r\nperforce by the concussion of the ship itself. In some cases the sudden\r\ntilting over causes an electric contact to be made, and permits a\r\nbattery in the mine to cause the explosion. Another way is to furnish\r\nthe mine with projecting horns of soft metal, inside which are glass\r\nvessels containing chemicals. The ship, striking a horn, bends it,\r\nbreaks the glass, and liberates the chemicals which cause the explosion.\r\n\r\nIn the type of mine largely used by the British Navy there is a\r\nprojecting arm pivoted on the top of the mine and projecting from it\r\nhorizontally. The mine itself rolls along the side of the passing ship,\r\nbut the arm simply trails or scrapes along. Thus the mine turns in\r\nrelation to the arm, and a trigger is thereby released, which fires the\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nIn this, be it noted, the ship only pulls the trigger, so to speak, and\r\nreleases a hammer which does the work, just as the trigger of a gun\r\nreleases the hammer. The motive force which makes the hammer do its work\r\nwhen the trigger is \"pulled\" is the pull on the anchor rope. That\r\narrangement has a virtue which is not apparent at first sight.\r\n\r\nSince it is the pull on the anchor rope which actually fires the mine,\r\nit follows that if such a mine break away from its moorings it instantly\r\nbecomes harmless.\r\n\r\nSafety for the men who lay the mines is secured in several ways. One is\r\nby the use of a hydrostatic valve. The firing mechanism is locked until\r\nthe pressure of water releases it, and that pressure does not exist\r\nuntil the mine is several feet under water. Another way is to seal up\r\nthe firing mechanism with a soluble seal made of some substance such as\r\nsal-ammoniac. The mine cannot then explode until it has been under water\r\nlong enough for the seal to be melted.\r\n\r\nIt now remains to relate how these mines are swept up and removed, yet\r\nthere is very little really to tell, for the process is so exceedingly\r\nsimple. So far as is generally known, no method has been found that is\r\nsuperior to the primitive plan of dragging a rope along between two\r\nships so as to catch the anchor ropes. The vessels employed are usually\r\nof very light draft, so that they stand a good chance of passing over\r\nthe mines themselves, and the rope used is as long as possible, so that\r\na mine, if exploded by being caught in the loop of the rope, explodes so\r\nfar away as to do no harm.\r\n\r\nWhen dragged to the surface the mines are exploded from a distance by\r\nshots from a small gun, or even from a rifle. In the case of those mines\r\nwhich have horns, a blow from a bullet is enough to break the glass and\r\ncause explosion, and in all cases mines seem sooner or later to succumb\r\nto a sharp blow. Thus they are destroyed, by their own action, at a safe\r\ndistance from the sweepers. Accidents happen, however, and mine-sweeping\r\nis no job for anyone but the bravest.\r\n\r\nIt has been somewhat difficult to crowd a description of torpedoes and\r\nmines into the small space of one chapter, and so many details have had\r\nto be omitted, but the above descriptions give the broad, general\r\nprinciples underlying practically all forms of these terrible weapons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nGOLD RECOVERY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has always been something very fascinating about gold. Even in\r\nancient times it was prized above all other things, and apparently it\r\nwas comparatively plentiful. It is estimated, for example, that King\r\nSolomon possessed over L4,000,000 worth of it, while the little gift\r\nwhich the Queen of Sheba brought him was of the handsome value of\r\nL600,000, so that she too must have been plentifully supplied with it.\r\n\r\nProbably it was more easily come by in those days, owing to the richness\r\nof the primitive deposits, the best of which, perchance, have been\r\nworked out. In one respect gold differs from all other metals (with the\r\nsingle exception of platinum, which is scarcer still) in that it appears\r\nnaturally as gold, not as ore. The little pieces of gold lie in the mine\r\nready to be picked out, and so if the deposit in which it occurs be near\r\nthe surface, and the particles be of any considerable size, they are\r\nsure to be found. A savage may be, and often is, very anxious to secure\r\nweapons and tools of iron, little knowing that the very ground upon\r\nwhich he stands is possibly of iron ore. He covets the single article of\r\niron, and in some cases is willing to give much gold for it, or ivory,\r\nor some such treasure, while thousands or millions of tons of iron lie\r\nat his feet, only he does not recognise it, nor would he know how to\r\nutilise it if he did.\r\n\r\nFor iron, like all other metals except the two just referred to, is\r\nfound naturally in combination with something else, generally oxygen,\r\nand the combination bears no resemblance at all to the metal. The red\r\nrust so familiar to us on iron is a combination of iron and oxygen, and\r\nit is fairly typical of the kind of state in which iron is found in the\r\nearth. Nor would anyone recognise copper ore, lead ore, tin ore, or any\r\nof the ores, any better than iron ore. All are difficult to recognise.\r\nIt is said that the highest compliment that a Cornish miner--the finest\r\nmetalliferous miners in the world come from Cornwall, or are the product\r\nof Cornish influence--the highest compliment that such a man can pay to\r\nanother is to say that \"he knows tin,\" meaning that he can tell tin ore\r\nwhen he sees it.\r\n\r\nContrasted with these other metals, gold is easy to find. It does, it is\r\ntrue, under certain conditions, form chemical compounds with other\r\nthings, as, for instance, in gold chloride, which is present in\r\nsea-water, but it does not oxidise as the others do, and so when it is\r\nin the earth it is in the bright yellow grains such as (if they be large\r\nenough) can easily be recognised at sight.\r\n\r\nAnd it is often found in beds of loose gravel, alluvial deposits, as\r\nthey are termed. In such cases the gold is to be had simply for the\r\npicking up. Sometimes a lucky find occurs in the form of a big nugget,\r\nbut more often the metal lies in tiny grains at long distances apart, so\r\nthat a ton of gravel has to be sorted over to find a paltry ounce or so\r\nof gold. Yet so desired is it that gold will always fetch its price, and\r\nan ounce to the ton (even less) is sometimes worth getting.\r\n\r\nBut in the early history of the world there were possibly particularly\r\ngenerous deposits with plenty of gold in good-sized pieces, and such\r\nwould be quickly discovered and worked by primitive man. No doubt the\r\nchieftains of those days took much, if not all, of the gold that their\r\npeople found, and more powerful chiefs and kings would, in turn, either\r\nby force or in trade, take it from the weaker, so that it is not\r\nsurprising to learn that some of the mighty kings and potentates of long\r\nago were well supplied with gold.\r\n\r\nYet there are few things more useless. Its value in the first instance\r\nwas probably entirely due to its beautiful colour, and the fact that it\r\ndoes not easily tarnish. For this reason, coupled with the fact that it\r\nwas by no means plentiful, men liked to deck themselves with it, not\r\nonly adding to their \"beauty\" by so doing, but advertising to their\r\nfellows the fact that they were men of wealth, men who possessed what\r\nfew others had, or at all events possessed it more abundantly. These\r\nthree basic facts about gold, its beauty, its freedom from deterioration\r\nand its comparative scarcity, give it its peculiar status among the\r\ncommodities of commerce, in that for it, and for it alone, there is a\r\ncontinuous and universal demand. No gold-mining company ever shut down\r\nits properties because of the falling off in the demand for gold. No one\r\never had to hawk gold about to find a purchaser; it is always saleable.\r\n\r\nAnd hence its value to humanity as the great medium of exchange. When a\r\ntailor wants bread, as has been pointed out by a great political\r\neconomist, he does not go searching for a baker who happens to need a\r\ncoat. If he did, he might starve before he found one. Instead, he gives\r\nhis coat to anyone who needs one, no matter what his trade may be,\r\ntaking gold in exchange. Then he goes with confidence to the baker,\r\nknowing full well that he, in turn, will be perfectly ready to give\r\nbread in exchange for gold. That is the principle upon which gold, and\r\nin a few cases silver, has become the foundation of trade. We use it for\r\ntoning photographs and a few other things, but, practically speaking, it\r\nis useless stuff, yet certain special circumstances have given it a\r\nspecial function in civilised society, and so governments now make it up\r\ninto little flat discs, putting their own special stamp upon them as a\r\nguarantee of size and quality, and it is by handing those little discs\r\nabout that we carry on our trade. Or even where we use no actual disc,\r\nwe pretend that we do, and use a piece of paper the value of which we\r\nsay is so many discs, but that value depends entirely upon the fact that\r\nsomeone has guaranteed, on demand, to give so many discs for it.\r\n\r\nAnd the strange thing about it is that although this usefulness of gold\r\ndepends upon its rarity, we lose no opportunity of looking for new\r\nsources of supply, and so diminishing that rarity. As has been said,\r\ngold is present in sea-water, although no one knows how to get it out,\r\nexcept at a cost which makes it not worth while. But suppose that some\r\ngenius found a way, and gold thus became twice as plentiful as it is\r\nnow, the world would be no better off. Everything would cost twice as\r\nmuch as it does now; that is all. A pound is merely so much gold. If\r\ngold be twice as plentiful people will want twice as much of it in\r\nexchange for what they have to sell. Yet, all the same, the man who\r\ncould solve that problem of getting gold from sea-water, or from\r\nanywhere else, in fact, would be hailed as a benefactor, and for a time\r\nat least he would reap a generous harvest.\r\n\r\nEven as it is, science has done much for the production of gold. Not, as\r\nin other metals, in finding ways for extracting it from its ores, for,\r\nstrictly speaking, it has none, but in finding ways of catching the tiny\r\nparticles of metal from the \"gangue,\" as it is called, the rock or earth\r\nin which they are embedded. The trouble is that they are so small, so\r\ninfinitesimally small, almost.\r\n\r\nThere are two great types of place where gold is found. In the alluvial\r\ndeposits, the beds of old rivers, the gold is quite loose. The\r\nconvulsions of ages ago have, in many cases, elevated these beds, until\r\nnow they are on the sides of mountains. In such cases the loose,\r\ngravelly stuff of which they are composed is washed down by a powerful\r\nstream of water from a huge hose-pipe terminating in a nozzle called a\r\n\"monitor.\" This process, called \"hydraulicing,\" brings down everything\r\ninto a pond formed at the foot of the hill, and in some cases a boat or\r\nraft is floated upon the pond with machinery on board for dredging up\r\nthe material. Often a powerful centrifugal pump sucks up the water\r\nthrough a pipe reaching to the bottom of the pond, bringing gravel and\r\ngold with it. Arrived in this way upon the raft, it all goes on to\r\nseparating tables, by which the gold, being heavier, is divided from the\r\ngravel, which is lighter. These tables will be referred to again later.\r\n\r\nIn non-alluvial workings the gold is embedded in rock of some kind, such\r\nas that called quartz. This is hard, somewhat of the nature of granite,\r\nand before the gold can be liberated it has to be crushed to the\r\nlikeness of fine sand, so that the tiny grains of gold can be captured.\r\nThe quartz is found in veins or lodes, fissures, evidently, in the\r\noriginal crust of the earth, produced probably as the earth cooled.\r\nThese have been gradually filled up by hot volcanic streams of water,\r\nwhich carried not only the gold in solution but also the materials of\r\nwhich the quartz is formed. It used to be thought that the veins were\r\nthe result of hot liquids forced up from below by volcanic action, the\r\nrock and metal being themselves in the liquid state through intense\r\nheat. It is now more generally held that water was the vehicle by which\r\nthe materials were brought in, and the vein formed. The gold in the\r\nalluvial deposits, too, is now thought to have come there in solution in\r\nwater, and not by the erosion and washing down of rocks higher up the\r\noriginal river.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, and it is the subject of discussion among\r\ngeologists and metallurgists, there the gold is to-day, firmly fixed in\r\nthe hard rock, and the problem which confronts the metallurgist is to\r\nget it out with the least expense. The old historic way of breaking up\r\nthe quartz rock is with what are called \"stamps,\" pestles and mortars on\r\na huge scale. There are a number of vertical beams of wood, each shod\r\nwith iron, fixed in a wooden frame, so that they are free to slide up\r\nand down. Running along behind these stamps is a horizontal shaft with\r\nprojections upon it called cams. There is one cam for each stamp, and as\r\nthe shaft turns slowly round this projection catches under a projection\r\non the stamp, and after lifting it up a short distance drops it\r\nsuddenly. Thus, as the machine works, the stamps are lifted and dropped\r\nin rapid succession. The rock is fed into a box into which the feet of\r\nthe stamps fall, and thus it is pounded until it is quite small.\r\nMeanwhile a stream of water flows through the box and carries away the\r\nfinely broken particles through a kind of sieve which forms the front\r\nof the box, and which allows the fine, small pieces to escape, while\r\nholding back the larger ones and keeping them until they too have been\r\ncrushed.\r\n\r\nAn average stamp will weigh 600 to 700 lb., and the repeated blows of\r\nsuch a hammer are enough to pulverise the hardest rock.\r\n\r\nMachines such as these have been employed since the sixteenth century,\r\nat all events, and the improvements of modern times are only as regards\r\ndetails. It may well be wondered, then, why such an old device is still\r\nin use and how it comes about that it has not been displaced by\r\nsomething newer and better. The answer, which is an instructive one,\r\nwell worth bearing in mind by many inexperienced inventors, is that it\r\nis so simple. It can be shipped in comparatively small parts, and so\r\ntaken cheaply to any outlandish place. A good deal of it can be made\r\nroughly of wood, so that if native timber is available it can be made\r\npartly at the mine, and carriage costs saved. Finally, it is so easy to\r\nwork and to understand that the most inexperienced workman can handle\r\nit, and there is so little that can go wrong that the most careless\r\nattendant cannot damage it.\r\n\r\nIn the bottom of the boxes there is placed some mercury, for which gold\r\nhas a curious affinity. If a particle of gold once gets into contact\r\nwith the surface of the mercury it will not get away again easily. Thus\r\nthe mercury catches and holds many of the gold particles which are\r\nliberated when the rock is broken up.\r\n\r\nAs it reaches the required fineness, then, the crushed rock escapes from\r\nthe stamp machine and flows away in the stream of water, and although\r\nmuch gold is caught by the mercury, it is by no means all. The stream is\r\ntherefore directed over tables formed of copper sheets coated with\r\nmercury, so that additional opportunities are given to mercury to catch\r\nthe grains of gold. Moreover, the table, which, by the way, is placed at\r\na slight incline, is broken at intervals by little troughs of mercury\r\ncalled riffles, which assist in the depositing and catching of the metal\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\nBut even then all the gold is not captured. The crushed rock is now like\r\nsand, and some of the grains still contain gold, which has not been\r\ndetached by the crushing. The gold, however, makes such grains slightly\r\nheavier than the others, and because of that they can be separated. The\r\nold way is to use a blanket table, a table, that is, covered with coarse\r\nflannel or baize, the hairs of which catch these heavier particles as\r\nthe water stream carries them along, the lighter particles escaping. The\r\ngrains so caught form what are known as \"concentrates,\" since in them\r\nthe gold is concentrated.\r\n\r\nThe concentrates are subsequently treated as we shall see later.\r\n\r\nNow we can see how modern scientific methods have supplemented the old\r\nways. Take first the case of the stamp mill or stamp battery. In spite\r\nof that prime virtue of simplicity which has kept it at work almost\r\nunchanged for centuries, it has its weaknesses, and no doubt for some\r\npurposes crushing mills are better. Of these there are a great variety,\r\nseveral of which depend for their action upon centrifugal force, or, as\r\nit is more correctly termed, \"centrifugal tendency.\" In these crushing\r\nmills there is a ring, generally of steel, inside which are suspended\r\none or more heavy iron rollers. The shafts which carry these rollers are\r\nattached by their upper ends to the driving mechanism on the top of the\r\nmill, and when that is set in motion the rolls are carried round and\r\nround inside the ring. Because of the centrifugal tendency, they swing\r\noutwards, pressing heavily against the inner surface of the ring. The\r\nrock is fed in in such a way that the rollers, as they roll round the\r\ninside of the ring, repeatedly travel over it and crush it.\r\n\r\nIn another type of mill, called the ball mill, the principle is\r\ndifferent. There you have a cylinder of steel which turns upon a\r\nhorizontal axis. This cylinder is partly filled with steel balls of\r\nvarious sizes, and as the mill turns, the rock, being mixed with these\r\nballs, is pounded and broken up. As the mill turns over and over the\r\nballs fall upon the pieces of rock, thus producing a fine powder. Other\r\nmills, again, are but refined editions of the common mortar mill so\r\noften seen where building operations are going on, in which heavy iron\r\nrollers travel over the material to be crushed as it lies in a round\r\npan.\r\n\r\nThe blanket table, too, gives place at the modern mine to the \"vanner,\"\r\nof which there are several varieties. Essentially they are much the\r\nsame, and a description of two will serve to give an idea of them all.\r\nLet us take the \"Record\" vanner.\r\n\r\nImagine a large table formed of wood, the upper surface covered with\r\nlinoleum. It is fixed on slides so that it can move to and fro endwise.\r\nIt is given a slight slope in the direction at right angles to its\r\nlength--that is to say, one edge is a little lower than the other. The\r\nmaterial is fed on at one end, at the higher edge, and naturally tends\r\nto run down and off at the lower edge. It is restrained somewhat from\r\ndoing this by the presence of rows of riffles or ridges running\r\nlengthwise. Nevertheless it does in a short time find its way off the\r\ntable at the lower end. But all the time that it is at work the table is\r\nbeing slidden backwards and forwards on the slides. By a simple but\r\ncurious mechanism it is arranged so that it moves quickly in one\r\ndirection and slowly in the other, with the result that the heavier\r\nparticles of sand--those which contain gold--are carried to the farther\r\nend of the table. Thus, as has been said, all the stuff is fed on to the\r\nhigher edge and carried down by the water, until it falls off at the\r\nlower edge, but during the journey from edge to edge the peculiar motion\r\nof the table causes the different kinds of sand to separate themselves,\r\nso that the concentrates fall off near one end, and the rest near the\r\nother end.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting example of ingenuity is the well-known \"Frue\"\r\nvanner. In this the table is a broad, endless band of india-rubber,\r\nextended upon two rollers, one of which is slightly higher than the\r\nother. The stream of water and crushed ore flows on at the upper end,\r\nand runs down to the lower, the lighter particles being carried down\r\nand dropped off at the _lower_ end, while the heavier rest upon the\r\nband. Meanwhile the turning of the rollers carries the band slowly\r\nalong, so that the heavier particles gradually ascend and are carried\r\nover at the _upper_ end. To assist in the separation, the whole concern\r\nis given a side-to-side shaking motion while it is at work.\r\n\r\nWe have seen so far how the ore is crushed, and the coarser grains of\r\ngold got out of it by the aid of mercury. The mixture of mercury and\r\ngold is termed amalgam, and the process of extracting gold by mercury is\r\ncalled amalgamation. The gold is actually dissolved in the mercury, and\r\nso when the amalgam has been (as it is periodically) collected from the\r\nplant, it has to be filtered and then evaporated in a retort. The\r\nmercury vapour is caught and condensed back into a liquid, while the\r\ngold is left in the retort. In fact the amalgam is distilled in order to\r\nseparate the gold and mercury.\r\n\r\nBut when all that is done we still have the concentrates from the\r\nvanners, or whatever be used, to deal with. Mercury is useless with\r\nthem, for the gold is covered probably with a coating of the other\r\nsubstances, whatever they may be, with which it has been associated, or\r\nelse there is mixed with the gold some substances which make\r\namalgamation impossible, or at least difficult.\r\n\r\nOften roasting is necessary before anything more can be done. If arsenic\r\nor sulphur be present, for example, they interfere with the recovery of\r\nthe gold, and roasting will disperse them. So the concentrates are\r\npassed through great furnaces, in which they are heated in contact with\r\nair until these objectionable matters have been oxidised or burnt.\r\n\r\nThen finally we come to some process by which the remaining gold is\r\ndissolved out from its admixtures in some solvent liquid from which it\r\ncan be subsequently precipitated. This is rather interesting, because it\r\nmeans that man has adopted, to recover this gold from the ore, the very\r\nmethod which it is believed nature employed to put it there. As already\r\nsaid, the latest idea is that the gold was carried into and deposited in\r\nthe lodes where it is now to be found by water--that the gold was\r\nactually dissolved in water at the time. But, of course, gold in its\r\nmetallic state will not dissolve in water. Salts of gold, however (the\r\nmeaning of the term salt, as applied to a metal, has been explained\r\nearlier), will dissolve in water, as every photographer who makes up his\r\nown toning solution knows from experience. Gold will not dissolve in\r\nwater, but chloride of gold will. And so the gold must have been carried\r\nto its resting-place as a salt, and converted into the metallic form\r\nafter arrival. In the same way, to recover these finest particles of\r\nall, it has to be converted back into a salt; then that salt must be\r\ndissolved and drained away from the other stuff; and, finally, the gold\r\nmust be thrown out of solution again in some way. The great example of\r\nthis operation is the familiar \"cyanide\" process.\r\n\r\nThe word familiar is appropriate to this matter in only one way,\r\nhowever. Holders of shares in mining companies, for example, may hear\r\nabout it repeatedly at shareholders' meetings and in prospectuses, but\r\nvery few have any clear idea as to what it is. So I cannot be accused of\r\ntelling an oft-told tale if I devote a short space to its consideration.\r\n\r\nThe combination of one atom of carbon and one atom of nitrogen is called\r\ncyanogen.\r\n\r\nIf cyanogen be given the chance it will take unto itself an atom of\r\nhydrogen, producing the deadly hydrocyanic or prussic acid.\r\nAlternatively, if potassium be brought into combination with it, there\r\nresults potassium cyanide, which, with the assistance of water and\r\noxygen, can dissolve gold.\r\n\r\nIn applying this scientific fact to the purpose of recovering gold from\r\nthe concentrates, the latter are placed in vats with a weak solution of\r\nthe cyanide in water. The time during which they are allowed to remain\r\ndepends upon the size of the gold particles. If they be comparatively\r\nlarge, it stands to reason that it must be longer than if they be\r\nsmall, for they will take longer to dissolve. After the proper time,\r\nwhich is found by experiment, the liquid is drawn off, and in some cases\r\nthe concentrates are given a second dose to ensure that the gold shall\r\nbe thoroughly removed and none left undissolved. If the material being\r\noperated upon be very fine, as it often is, forming what the mining\r\npeople call \"slimes,\" then mechanical stirrers have to be used in the\r\nvats to keep the stuff moving, as otherwise the cyanide would not get to\r\nall the particles and some would not be acted upon.\r\n\r\nThe liquid, having been the appropriate time in the vat, is drawn off,\r\nplaced in wooden tanks or boxes, and fine shreds of zinc are added to\r\nit. Discs of sheet zinc are put into a lathe and a fine shaving taken\r\noff them, and it is these fine shavings which are used. Now zinc, as we\r\nknow from the fact that it is the essential part in electric batteries,\r\nhas very pronounced electrical properties, and it is believed that these\r\ncome into play here. At all events the gold becomes deposited upon the\r\nzinc, while the zinc itself is to a certain extent eaten away by the\r\nsolution. The result is (_a_) a solution weaker than it was before,\r\n(_b_) the remains of the shavings, and (_c_), at the bottom of the box\r\nin which this process takes place, _a dark mud_. That black mud, on\r\nbeing heated, produces the bright metallic gold, and the object of the\r\nwhole operation is achieved. The solution is then led to another tank,\r\nbrought up to its proper strength again and is ready to be used once\r\nmore, while the remains of the shavings are used for the next batch of\r\nmaterial to be treated.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the crushed ore straight from the crushing mill is\r\ncyanided, in others it is simply the remains left over from the previous\r\namalgamating process which is thus treated. All depends upon the nature\r\nof the material in question.\r\n\r\nThere are other chemical methods besides the cyaniding, but it is the\r\nchief. It has been found specially useful with the Johannesburg ores,\r\nand to it the South African goldfields owe a great deal of their\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThere is a more modern form of it, although the whole process is quite\r\nnovel, having been introduced only in the nineties of last century. This\r\ndevelopment, it is almost wearying to repeat, is electrical. Instead of\r\nthe zinc shavings being used to precipitate the gold out of the\r\nsolution, the process is electrolytic. A lead anode is used while the\r\nprocess is carried on in a box the bottom of which is covered with\r\nmercury, which forms the cathode. The precipitated gold is thus\r\namalgamated, the amalgam being removed at intervals, retorted, and the\r\ngold recovered.\r\n\r\nThe idea of recovering gold from the waters of the sea is certainly a\r\nmost attractive one. To some, it is true, the suggestion may bring\r\nthoughts the reverse of pleasant, for there have been several partially\r\nsuccessful attempts to delude the public with specious promises of vast\r\ndividends to be gathered in the form of pure gold from the inexhaustible\r\nsea. Still, there is something in it, and some day the dreams may be\r\nrealised.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of gold dissolved in sea-water is so small that in 200\r\ncubic centimetres it is impossible to detect it, even by the most\r\ndelicate tests known. The quantity needs to be multiplied threefold\r\nbefore the quantity of gold becomes even detectable, to say nothing of\r\nbeing recoverable.\r\n\r\nA writer in _Cassier's Magazine_, a few years ago, related how he had\r\nactually obtained gold from the water of Long Island Sound. But whereas\r\nhe got two dollars' worth, it cost him over 4000 dollars to do it. No\r\ncompany will ever be floated on results such as that. From the mud of a\r\ncreek near New York, however, he did a little better, for there ten\r\ndollars' worth of gold only cost 379 dollars. A company promoter would\r\nstill look askance at even that comparatively successful undertaking.\r\n\r\nAs usual, authorities differ, but there is a consensus of opinion that\r\nin every ton of sea-water there is from one-half to one grain of gold,\r\nbesides silver and iodine.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if the water were able to dissolve that amount and no more.\r\nIf, as has been suggested earlier in this chapter, all the gold which is\r\nnow found in mines and in gravel beds was carried there in water, it is\r\nprobable that the sea obtains its gold from the same original sources,\r\nand that, just as the hot ocean of ages ago carried its burden of gold\r\nin solution, so the colder water of to-day has its share, the cold water\r\nnaturally carrying less than the hot did.\r\n\r\nIt is quite likely, then, that, could we find out how to rob the sea of\r\nits precious metal, it could replenish its store from some secret hoard\r\nof its own. But even if it could not, it would make little difference to\r\nus, since what it holds is far more than we could ever use. Put it at\r\nhalf-a-grain per ton: there are 4205 million tons in every cubic mile of\r\nocean, and 300 million cubic miles of water in the ocean. If all the\r\ngold that man has ever handled were to be dissolved in the sea, no\r\nchemist would be able to discover the fact. On the other hand, if that\r\nhalf-grain per ton which we believe to be in the ocean now were to be\r\nrecovered we should have about 40,000 million tons of gold, a prospect\r\nwhich is enough to make the political economist turn pale with\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\nWhat is required is some substance which, on being added to sea-water,\r\nwill combine with the gold, and then be precipitated--that is to say,\r\nfall to the bottom. The precipitate--that which falls to the\r\nbottom--would need to be heavy, so that it would fall quickly and not\r\nnecessitate the water being left standing for long periods. It would\r\nneed to be cheap, too, or easily recoverable, so that it could be used\r\nover and over again. And, finally, it would need to be such that the\r\ngold, having been captured by it, could be easily obtained from it.\r\n\r\nGiven such a precipitant, the process of recovering the gold would be\r\nsimple and cheap. Tanks would be formed in sheltered bays and inlets. At\r\nevery tide these would be filled, and when full the precipitant would be\r\nadded. The tide falling, the water would run out again and leave the\r\nprecipitate on the floor of the tanks, whence it could be removed by\r\nscraping. Simple treatment would release the gold from its partner,\r\nwhich would then be returned to the tanks to act as the precipitant once\r\nmore. Thus by simple means, the tide itself assisting, the gold could\r\nbe obtained from the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd there is nothing inherently impossible about this suggestion. The\r\nnecessary precipitant may exist, awaiting discovery. A large works\r\noperating in this manner would produce, it is estimated, about thirteen\r\ntons of gold per annum. It looks as if it would be a bad day for the\r\nRand when that discovery is made.\r\n\r\nAnd there is yet another possibility, though less alluring than what has\r\njust been described. The American writer mentioned a little while back\r\ngot a better return from the mud of a creek than from the water itself.\r\nIn all probability this is due to the action of organic matter carried\r\ndown by streams, or in some other way introduced into the waters of the\r\ncreek whence the mud was obtained. This organic matter would possibly\r\nhave an effect as a precipitant upon the dissolved gold, causing it to\r\nbe thrown out of solution and deposited in the mud. Thus the mud around\r\nour shores, and particularly in the creeks and estuaries, may be\r\npotential gold mines whence in time to come we may draw supplies of the\r\nprecious metal. The cyanide or some similar process may be needed in\r\norder that we may extract the metal from its enclosing mud, but the time\r\nmay not be so very far distant when dredging for gold may be a regular\r\noccupation at, for example, the mouths of the Thames and the Hudson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nINTENSE HEAT\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the useful and interesting manufacturing processes of to-day are\r\nbased upon the intense heat which science has taught the manufacturer\r\nhow to produce. Tasks which our forefathers dreamed of, but were unable\r\nto accomplish, are easy to-day because of the facility with which great\r\nheat can be generated. The \"burning fiery furnace\" \"seven times heated\"\r\nis as nothing to some of the temperatures which are now obtained in the\r\nordinary course of things.\r\n\r\nThe greatest heat of all is that of the electric arc. Two conductors,\r\ngenerally rods of carbon, are placed with their ends touching, and the\r\ncurrent is turned on so that it passes from one to the other. Then they\r\nare gradually drawn apart. As the gap widens the current experiences\r\nmore and more difficulty in passing over this non-conducting gap, and\r\ngreat electrical energy has to be employed to keep it going. Now that\r\nwonderful law of the Conservation of Energy decrees that no energy can\r\never be lost. It can only be changed from one form into another.\r\nTherefore the energy expended upon the arc is not lost, but is converted\r\ninto heat. It is that heat, acting upon the small particles of carbon\r\nwhich are torn off the ends of the rods, which gives us the arc light.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact nearly all artificial light (and natural light too\r\nfor that matter[1]) is due to heat. The heat sets the molecules in\r\nviolent agitation, which, acting upon the corpuscles in the atoms, sets\r\nthem in violent motion too, so that light is often the companion of\r\nheat. Some substances give light more readily than others, under the\r\ninfluence of heat, and we may reasonably believe that they are those\r\nwhose corpuscular arrangements are such that they can be readily\r\naccelerated by the molecular action.\r\n\r\n[1] The glow-worm is an example of the few exceptions.\r\n\r\nTo take a familiar instance, coal-gas is mainly \"methane,\" one of the\r\nmany combinations of carbon and hydrogen, and when it is burnt in air\r\nthe hydrogen and oxygen combine, liberating heat, which causes the\r\ncarbon liberated at the same time to glow. As each methane molecule\r\nbreaks up the carbon atoms are thrown out, forming solid particles of\r\ncarbon, and it is they really which give the light. It is therefore the\r\ncombustible gas heating the solid particles of carbon which forms the\r\nluminous part of the gas flame. The non-luminous part of the flame, near\r\nthe burner (I am now speaking of the old-fashioned burner), is the\r\nburning gas before the carbon particles have had time to heat up.\r\n\r\nAnd the old gas flame, as we know, is now being rapidly displaced by the\r\nincandescent mantle, the reason being simply that Von Welsbach\r\ndiscovered how certain rare minerals gave a more brilliant light when\r\nheated than particles of carbon do. In other words, it is easier to\r\naccelerate the motion of the corpuscles in ceria, thoria and the other\r\ningredients of the mantle, than it is those of carbon. Consequently,\r\nthey sooner reach that degree of agitation which will send forth\r\nelectro-magnetic waves of the high frequency necessary to produce the\r\nsensation of light.\r\n\r\nFor this reason the mantle heated by gas gives as bright a light as the\r\ncarbon particles in the electric arc, although the latter are subjected\r\nto a much more intense heat.\r\n\r\nBut the arc can be, and often is, used as a source of heat, apart\r\naltogether from the light which it gives. In Sweden, for example, where\r\ncoal is rare, but water-power plentiful, the power of the waterfalls is\r\nmade to smelt iron. Hence the waterfalls are sometimes termed the \"white\r\ncoal\" of that country. Needless to say, it is the ubiquitous electricity\r\nwhich performs the change from the force of falling water into heat.\r\n\r\nThe furnaces are in shape much like those in which iron is smelted with\r\ncoal--namely, tall chimney-like structures at the bottom of which is the\r\nfire. In the \"arc furnaces\" there are, passing in through the side, near\r\nthe bottom, a number of electrodes, and between these a series of arcs\r\nare formed. Coke and ironstone are thrown in from the top into this\r\nregion of intense heat, and there the iron is liberated from the oxygen\r\nwith which it is combined in the ore. Liberated, it flows out through a\r\nspout at one side of the furnace.\r\n\r\nBut the question will arise in the reader's mind: Why is coke needed in\r\nan electric furnace? It is for metallurgical reasons. The heat of the\r\narc loosens the bonds between the iron and oxygen, but it needs the\r\npresence of some carbon to tempt the oxygen atoms away. Therefore coke,\r\nas the most convenient form of carbon, has to be there. It is there,\r\nhowever, in much smaller quantity than it would be in an ordinary\r\nfurnace. It is not there as fuel, but simply as the \"counter-attraction\"\r\nto draw the oxygen atoms away from their old love.\r\n\r\nThe arc is also used for welding pieces of iron together, for which\r\npurpose it is eminently suitable, since what is wanted is intense heat\r\nat a particular point. But perhaps the reader will be wondering by this\r\ntime what the heat of the arc is. It has been repeatedly referred to as\r\n\"intense,\" but something more definite may be demanded. In theory it is\r\nunlimited. Apply more pressure--more volts, that is--thereby driving\r\nmore current across, and the temperature will rise. It is only a\r\nquestion of making dynamos large enough, and driving them fast enough,\r\nand any temperature is possible. But there are practical difficulties\r\nwhich limit the degree of heat. One is the melting-point of the furnace\r\nitself. Fire-clay melts at about 1700 deg. to 1800 deg. C. So in a furnace which\r\nhas to be lined with fire-clay that is about the limit.\r\n\r\nIn welding two pieces of iron together, the iron, of course, defines\r\nwhat the limit shall be. It needs to be heated to \"welding heat\" and no\r\nmore--that is, a little short of melting--so that the parts to be joined\r\nare soft, and, with a little hammering, will join thoroughly together.\r\nIf too much heat were to be applied the parts would melt away. But the\r\nheat of the arc can be controlled by simply varying the current, and so\r\nthe right heat can be applied at the right place, than which little more\r\nis wanted.\r\n\r\nOne very simple way of doing this is for the workman to hold one of the\r\n\"electrodes\"--a rod of carbon suitably insulated--in his hand. The\r\ncurrent is led to it through a flexible wire. The iron itself is made\r\nthe other electrode by being gripped in a vice which is itself insulated\r\nbut connected to the source of current. Thus on bringing the point of\r\nhis rod near to the part to be heated the man causes an arc to be\r\ncreated there. By moving the rod he can move the arc about, heating one\r\npart more than another, distributing his heat if he wants to do so over\r\na larger area, or keeping it to a small one, just as he wills. On\r\nreaching the right heat the rod is withdrawn, the arc destroyed, and the\r\niron can be hammered just as if it had been heated in a fire.\r\n\r\nYet another way still is known as \"resistance\" welding. In it an\r\nenormous current at an extremely low voltage is used. The fundamental\r\nprinciple is the same, since the heat is formed by forcing current past\r\na point over which it is reluctant to pass. That point of poor\r\nconductivity is the ends of the two bars to be joined. They are placed\r\njust touching, but since an imperfect contact like that always offers\r\nconsiderable resistance to the flow of a current, the passing current\r\nneeds only to be made large enough for great heat to be generated.\r\n\r\nThis is exceedingly pretty to watch. We will suppose that the article to\r\nbe operated upon is the tyre of a wheel. The bar of iron has already\r\nbeen bent by rollers into the correct curve and the two ends are\r\ntouching. Brought to the machine, it is gripped, each side of the\r\njunction, in the jaws of an insulated vice and the current is turned on.\r\nIn a few seconds the place where the two ends are just touching begins\r\nto glow. Rapidly it increases in brightness until in about half-a-minute\r\nit is at welding heat. Then one vice, which is movable, is forced along\r\na little by a screw, so that the ends are pressed firmly together, a\r\nlittle judicious hammering meanwhile helping to complete the job. Then\r\nthe current is switched off and the complete tyre taken out of the\r\nmachine. The current used has a force comparable with that which\r\noperates domestic electric bells, but in volume it is thousands of\r\namperes. Alternating current is used, and it is obtained from a\r\ntransformer or induction coil. In such a case the primary part of the\r\ncoil is made of many turns of fine wire, so that little current passes\r\nthrough it, while the secondary part is but one or two turns of thick\r\nbar. Thus the voltage generated in the secondary is very little, but\r\nsince the secondary has an almost negligible resistance the current\r\ncaused by that small voltage is enormous. Such an arrangement is in\r\nindustrial realms generally called a transformer, the term induction\r\ncoil being employed more for those things of a similar nature intended\r\nfor the laboratory. The one just described is, moreover, a \"step-down\"\r\ntransformer, since it lowers the voltage, to distinguish it from\r\n\"step-up\" transformers, which raise the voltage.\r\n\r\nAnd the \"resistance\" principle is also applied in another way to large\r\nfurnaces, such as those for refining iron. In these the resistance of\r\nthe iron itself is utilised to generate the heat. Of course, it should\r\nbe well understood, heat is always generated in everything through which\r\ncurrent flows. There is no perfect conductor, and so every conductor is\r\nmore or less heated by the passage of current through it. Some energy\r\nneeds to be expended to drive current, even along large copper wires,\r\nand that energy must be turned into heat in the wires. If the same\r\nvolume of current be forced along iron wires of the same size, the heat\r\nwill be greater, since iron is but a poor conductor compared with\r\ncopper, the relation being about as one to six. And if the iron be hot\r\nthe resistance will be still more, for it stands to reason that when\r\nheated the molecules, being farther apart, will be the less easily able\r\nto exchange corpuscles. We have the best reasons for believing, as has\r\nbeen suggested already, that a current of electricity is but a flow of\r\ncorpuscles, and so we are not surprised to hear that, as a general rule,\r\nthe hotter a thing is the less does it conduct electricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n_By permission of Cambridge Scientific Inst. Co., Ltd., Cambridge, Eng._\r\n\r\n                   MEASURING HEAT AT A DISTANCE\r\n\r\nThis wonderful instrument, the Fery Radiation Pyrometer, although itself\r\nsome distance away from the furnace, is telling the temperature of its\r\n                           hottest part.]\r\n\r\nSo imagine a circular trough of fire-clay or other heat-resisting\r\nmaterial filled with fragments of iron, or, it may be, with iron barely\r\nabove melting-point, which has come from another furnace, where it\r\nunderwent the previous process. Circling inside or outside this trough\r\nis an enormous coil of wire through which currents of electricity are\r\nalternating. That is the \"primary\" of a transformer, and the \"secondary\"\r\nis--the iron itself, in the trough. If it be, as it often is, in the\r\nform of scrap, or broken pieces, the heat will begin to show itself\r\nwhere the pieces touch each other. The currents generated in the trough,\r\nby the coil outside, will, of course, pass from piece to piece and the\r\npoints of contact, since they offer the greatest resistance, will show\r\nsigns of heat. This will increase until the pieces begin to melt. As the\r\nseparate fragments merge into the molten mass the resistance will in one\r\nway decrease, for the imperfect contacts between the pieces will give\r\nplace to the perfect contact throughout the mass of liquid metal. But\r\nfor another reason--namely, the increase in heat--the resistance will\r\nincrease. And all the while the alternations in the primary coil will be\r\npumping currents, as it were, round and round the ring of molten iron.\r\nWhether the resistance increase or decrease, the current will do the\r\nopposite, so that heat will be generated whatever happens. For as\r\nresistance decreases current increases, and vice versa. And the\r\nslightest variation in the strength of the primary current will have its\r\neffect upon the secondary, and therefore on the heat generated. So, by\r\nsimply regulating the primary current, the temperature of the metal can\r\nbe controlled to a nicety. And such furnaces have the immense advantage\r\nthat there is no possibility of deleterious substances in the fuel\r\ngetting into and spoiling the metal, a thing which may very easily\r\nhappen during the manufacture of high-class steels, alloys of iron in\r\nwhich the exact quantities, purity and proportions of the ingredients\r\nare of the utmost importance.\r\n\r\nHence these \"induction furnaces,\" as they are called, are frequently\r\nused quite apart from any question of utilising water-power. And they\r\nwill probably be used still more as time goes on.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, they may become valuable adjuncts to the older form of\r\niron and steel furnaces, from which they will obtain their power free,\r\ngratis and for nothing. In districts such as Middlesbrough they could\r\ngenerate more electricity than they have any use for. The ordinary iron\r\nfurnaces belch forth flames which are really good useful gas (carbon\r\nmonoxide) burning to waste. Many of the furnaces are covered in at the\r\ntop, and this gas is led away to heat boilers for the steam-engines or\r\nto drive large gas-engines, but in a large works there is more of this\r\nwaste gas than they know what to do with. Now that could, and probably\r\nwill ere long, be turned into electricity by means of gas-engines and\r\nthe current used for making steel in induction furnaces.\r\n\r\nIt will probably surprise many to know that these enormous currents\r\nwhich can thus heat great masses of metal until they melt are no danger\r\nat all to the men who work with them. A man might dip an iron rod into\r\nthe trough of metal and he would scarcely feel the shock. And the same\r\nis true of the welding machine, which can be touched in any part without\r\nfear. The reason, of course, is that, broadly speaking, it is volume of\r\ncurrent which does harm, and the resistance of the human body is so\r\ngreat that with the small voltages used, the volume which can pass is\r\nnegligible. It should be mentioned, however, that the volume of current\r\nin lightning is also small, but we know that it is capable of inflicting\r\nterrible injury. Lightning, however, is in a class by itself. Our\r\nterrestrial voltages are baffled by an air-gap of a few inches, but\r\nlightning springs across a gap miles wide. Its voltage must, therefore,\r\namount to millions, and the ordinary rules relating to earthly currents\r\ndo not apply.\r\n\r\nBut other sources of heat besides electricity are at the disposal of our\r\nmanufacturers nowadays. Pre-eminently there is the flame of some gas\r\nburning with pure oxygen. The oxyhydrogen jet has been known for many\r\nyears as the best means of producing the light for a magic lantern. Such\r\na jet impinging upon a pencil of lime causes the latter to glow with a\r\ndazzling white light.\r\n\r\nBut the oxyhydrogen jet is now employed in many factories for the\r\nwelding of metals. This is known as fusion welding, since the two parts\r\nare actually reduced to liquid. The usual way to go about this work is\r\nto bevel off the ends or edges to be joined. Suppose, for instance, that\r\nwe wanted to weld two pieces of brass pipe together. We should first\r\nfile or otherwise trim the edges to be joined until when put together\r\nthey form a groove practically as deep as the metal is thick. Then with\r\na stick of brass wire in the left hand, and an oxyhydrogen blowpipe in\r\nthe right, we should direct the flame from the pipe on to the metal\r\nuntil, at one point, the sides of the groove were beginning to melt.\r\nThen, inserting the point of the wire into the groove, we should melt a\r\nlittle off it. Thus we should work all round the joint, melting the\r\nsides of the groove and filling in with melted metal from the wire,\r\nuntil the whole groove had been filled up and the metal added had been\r\nthoroughly amalgamated with that on either side.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, if it were brass which we were working on we should\r\nprobably use the cheaper though less pure form of hydrogen--coal-gas--so\r\nthat it would really be \"oxycoal-gas\" that we should use and not\r\noxyhydrogen. The latter is used, however, notably for the fusion-welding\r\nof lead, or \"lead-burning,\" as it is termed.\r\n\r\nThe blowpipe is a brass tube about a foot or eighteen inches long, with\r\ntwo passages in it, one for the oxygen and the other for the other gas.\r\nThe gases are brought to one end of it through rubber pipes, while at\r\nthe other end there is a nozzle in which the gases mingle and from\r\nwhich they emerge in a fine jet.\r\n\r\nThe oxyhydrogen flame has a temperature of about 2000 deg. C., hot enough to\r\nmelt fire-clay. That does not matter in the case of welding, however,\r\nsince the molten metal is very small in quantity at any given moment,\r\nand is allowed to cool before it can run away. It would be an awkward\r\ntemperature to deal with, nevertheless, in a furnace. It seems strange\r\nthat it does not burn the nozzle of the blowpipe, but the fact that it\r\ndoes not is, it is believed, explained by the fact that the expansion of\r\nthe gas, as soon as it emerges from the hole out of which it shoots,\r\ncauses a comparatively cool space just there, shielding it from the\r\nintense heat farther on.\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly interesting use of the oxyhydrogen flame is in the\r\nmanufacture of artificial rubies. These stones are made in Paris by a\r\nvery simple means. The necessary chemicals are prepared and ground to an\r\nexceedingly fine powder. This is then allowed to fall through an\r\noxyhydrogen flame. Thus there is no need for a crucible capable of\r\nwithstanding this high temperature, since the melting takes place as the\r\nparticles are in the act of falling. When they reach the support\r\nprepared to catch them they have cooled somewhat. Stones so called are\r\nreal rubies--artificial, but not shams. They possess every property of\r\nthe ruby from the mine.\r\n\r\nAnother product of the oxyhydrogen flame is the quartz fibres which are\r\nused for suspending the needles in the finest galvanometers. The quartz\r\nis melted, in this case a crucible being employed. An arrow is then\r\ndipped in the liquid quartz and immediately \"fired\" into the air. The\r\nthick treacly liquid is thus drawn out into a thread of such fineness\r\nthat a microscope is necessary to find it with.\r\n\r\nHotter even than oxyhydrogen is the oxyacetylene flame, which at its\r\nhottest point reaches nearly 3500 deg. C. The gas, which is another of the\r\ncombinations of carbon and hydrogen (its molecules containing two atoms\r\nof each), is easily made by allowing water to come into contact with\r\ncalcium carbide. The latter, which is CaC_{2}, is made by heating coke\r\nand lime together in the intense heat of an electric furnace. This\r\naccounts largely for the great heating power of acetylene, for since\r\ngreat heat is necessary to cause the elements to combine great heat is\r\ngiven out by them when they ultimately separate. Here again is the\r\nconservation of energy. The heat energy of the electric furnace is\r\nlargely expended in forcing these two elements into partnership. They\r\nare, as it were, given a large amount of capital in the form of heat. It\r\nceases to be sensible heat, becoming latent in the compound, but still\r\nit is there. So a lump of calcium carbide, with which many readers are\r\nfamiliar, has vast stores of heat locked up within it. When water comes\r\ninto contact with the carbide the partnership is broken, but the heat is\r\nnot liberated then, since another partnership is formed, which still\r\nretains the old heat-capital. The calcium in the carbide is displaced by\r\nthe hydrogen from the water, and so C_{2}H_{2} comes into being, while\r\nthe rejected calcium consoles itself by entering into combination with\r\nthe equally forsaken oxygen from the water, forming CaO, which is but\r\nanother name for lime.\r\n\r\nThen the acetylene (C_{2}H_{2}) is mixed with oxygen in the blowpipe and\r\nburnt, under which conditions the pent-up heat, borrowed originally from\r\nthe electric furnace, is brought into play. With this flame the harder\r\nmetals can be fused and welded. Wrought iron, cast-iron, steel in all\r\nits forms, all can be melted by the oxyacetylene flame, almost as easily\r\nas snow by a hot iron. The fusion welding of these metals is then\r\ncarried on just as already described for brass.\r\n\r\nBy means of a special blowpipe, wherein an excess of oxygen is\r\nintroduced at the hot point, hard steel plates can be cut to pieces\r\nalmost as easily as a grocer cuts cheese. Even thick, hard armour-plate\r\ncan thus be cut, almost the only way, indeed, in which it can be cut.\r\n\r\nAnd for purposes such as welding and cutting this flame has an\r\ninteresting and peculiar advantage over all other kinds of heat. When a\r\nmetal is heated in the air there is usually trouble from oxidation. The\r\ndomestic poker, for example, after it has been left to get red-hot in\r\nthe fire is seen to be coated, in the part which has been heated, with\r\nscales which will flake off if the thing be struck. Those scales are\r\noxide of iron, caused by the union of iron and oxygen when the poker was\r\nhot. But if the heat be applied by the oxyacetylene flame that will not\r\nhappen. The oxygen and the carbon from the acetylene will burn, and if\r\nthe supply of the former be properly regulated it will be entirely used\r\nup in the process. The hydrogen from the acetylene is, strange to say,\r\nunable to unite with oxygen at such a high temperature as that of the\r\noxygen and carbon, so that it passes on beyond the oxygen-carbon flame\r\nand ultimately burns on its own account with the oxygen from the\r\natmosphere in a second flame surrounding the first. Thus there is a\r\ndouble flame: inside, a little pointed cone of white flame, that is the\r\noxygen and carbon; and outside that a bluish flame, the hydrogen and the\r\natmospheric oxygen. The latter flame forms a kind of jacket entirely\r\nenveloping the former. And so when one melts metal by means of the white\r\ncone the hydrogen jacket shields the molten metal from oxygen and\r\nprevents the oxidation. Only one who knows the bother caused by\r\noxidation whenever metals are heated can realise the wonderful advantage\r\nof this.\r\n\r\nAnd now we can turn to even another source, also quite modern, of high\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nIf the oft-quoted \"man in the street\" were asked the two commonest\r\nthings on earth he might possibly name oxygen as one, and so far he\r\nwould be right, but the chances are much against his naming aluminium as\r\nthe second. If he did not, however, he would be wrong. Aluminium and\r\noxygen form alumina, of which are constituted the sapphire, the ruby and\r\nother precious stones, but alumina is most commonly found in combination\r\nwith silica, or silicon and oxygen. This compound is called silicate of\r\naluminium, and of it are formed clay and many rocks. The reason why the\r\nmetal aluminium was until recently rare and expensive was because of the\r\ngreat difficulty of disentangling the metal from this rather complex\r\ncombination. And these two commonest elements have, under certain\r\nconditions, a rare affinity for each other. They join forces with such\r\nenergy that great heat is given out in the process. This, again, we may\r\nregard as an example of the conservation of energy. Heat had to be used\r\nup, apparently, in separating the aluminium and oxygen as they were\r\nfound together in the natural state. And that heat reappears when they\r\ncombine together again. This is a most useful principle, for if heat has\r\ndisappeared anywhere in the course of some operation, we know that in\r\nall probability, if we go about it the right way, we can get that heat\r\nback again, perhaps in a more convenient form. That is so in this case\r\nat all events.\r\n\r\nNow aluminium will not readily combine with atmospheric oxygen, but it\r\nwill readily do so with oxygen from the oxide of a metal. So if we put\r\ninto a vessel some oxide of iron and some finely powdered aluminium, and\r\ngive it some heat at one point, just to set the process going, the whole\r\nmass will burn with intense heat. And when the burning is finished the\r\ncrucible will be found to contain (1) some molten iron, the oxide of\r\niron with the oxygen gone, and (2) some oxide of aluminium or alumina,\r\nin the form which we call corundum, a very hard substance which in a\r\npowdered form is used for grinding hard metals. We start, you will\r\nnotice, with a pure metal and an oxide. We finish with a pure metal and\r\nan oxide, only the oxygen has changed its quarters, having passed from\r\nthe iron to the aluminium. And in the course of the change a vast amount\r\nof pent-up heat has been liberated. Aluminium is thus a fuel, strange\r\nthough it may seem to say so, just as coal is. Coal, however, is willing\r\nto pair off with oxygen from the air, while aluminium, more fastidious,\r\nwill only accept it as partner when it can steal it from another\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nBut the practical result is eminently satisfactory, for the action of\r\nthe aluminium and iron oxide is to leave us with a crucible full of\r\nmolten iron at a very high temperature. And this can be used in various\r\nways.\r\n\r\nTramway rails, for example, can be joined together by it. A mould is\r\nformed around the ends of two rails, where they \"butt\" together, and\r\ninto this mould a quantity of the melted iron can be poured. So hot is\r\nit that it partially melts the ends of the rails, and then, amalgamating\r\nwith them, it forms a perfectly homogeneous connection between them.\r\n\r\nThe same method can be applied to the repair of iron structures of all\r\nkinds. The propeller shaft of a ship, for example, sometimes breaks on a\r\nvoyage. Such a catastrophe is fraught with the most serious\r\nconsequences, unless it can be quickly repaired. Thermit, as this\r\nprocess is called, is perhaps the only means whereby, under certain\r\nconditions, this can be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary heat of the metal produced in this way is demonstrated\r\nby the fact that if it be poured on to an iron plate an inch thick it\r\ngoes clean through it. It melts its way through instantly.\r\n\r\nBut although such high temperatures are at the command of the modern\r\nmanufacturer, there are some things--indeed many things--which still\r\nbaffle him, the diamond, for example. It is true that diamonds of small\r\nsize have been made, but larger ones have so far defied all efforts.\r\n\r\nOne very interesting fact about this may be mentioned in concluding this\r\nchapter. Sir Andrew Noble, a member of the great firm of Armstrong,\r\nWhitworth & Co., of Elswick, tried the experiment of exploding some\r\ncordite, a high explosive, inside a steel vessel of enormous strength.\r\nHe thus produced what is believed to be the highest temperature ever\r\nproduced on earth. It is reckoned to have been 5200 deg. C., and the\r\npressure at the same time was, it is calculated, 50 tons per square\r\ninch. His intention was not to make diamonds, but Sir William Crookes\r\npredicted that diamonds would be the result. For the cordite consisted\r\nmainly of carbon, which, as is well known, is the material of which the\r\ndiamond is formed, and the combination of high temperature and high\r\npressure is just what is needed, so it is believed, to bring the carbon\r\ninto this particular form. And true enough, on the iron being examined\r\nafter the explosion, there were seen tiny diamonds. For larger ones even\r\nhigher temperatures and greater pressures are, no doubt, necessary, and\r\nas the diamond, like gold, has a peculiar fascination for mankind, so\r\nthe efforts to manufacture it will continue. In years to come the means\r\nmay be found of creating these extreme conditions of temperature and\r\npressure, and so another of the problems of the ages will be solved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n              _By permission of the British Aluminium Co_\r\n\r\n             A STRIKING FEATURE OF MODERN ALUMINIUM WORKS\r\n\r\nFor the production of aluminium water power is required.

One has only to recall that heart-rending calamity of the\r\nCourrieres mines in France, where over a thousand lives were lost, to\r\nrealise how important is the question of the cause and the cure of the\r\ncolliery explosion.\r\n\r\nIt used to be thought a settled matter that these were due to the\r\naccidental ignition of a gas called, scientifically, \"methane,\" but by\r\nthe miners \"fire-damp.\" This undoubtedly does collect in many mines, and\r\nsince it is much the same as the domestic coal-gas (indeed methane forms\r\nthe bulk of coal-gas) it is not surprising that the explosions were\r\nattributed to it. At times shots were fired, to blast down the coal, and\r\nalthough the greatest precautions are taken to prevent any accident\r\nresulting, it seems certain that explosions have occasionally followed\r\nthe firing of shots. But still more dangerous is the adventurous miner\r\nwho, for some reason, opens his safety lamp. It is lit for him before he\r\nenters the workings, and locked up, so that, theoretically, he cannot\r\ntamper with it; but it has to be a cleverly devised lock that cannot be\r\npicked in some way, and with the carelessness born of long immunity from\r\naccident these are got open sometimes, with, it may be, disastrous\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nEven a spark struck from a miner's pick may ignite the gas; or a spark\r\nfrom some electrical machine used in the mine. That is one of the\r\nreasons why electrical apparatus is suspect in colliery matters and\r\nmachines worked by the less convenient and more costly means of\r\ncompressed air are preferred.\r\n\r\nIn some such manner the fire-damp is ignited, and then there follows the\r\nfiery blast, which, sweeping through the narrow galleries and passages\r\nwhich constitute the workings, simply licks up the life of the men whom\r\nit encounters. Others, in byways and sheltered corners, escaping the\r\nburning cloud of flame, are poisoned by the deadly fumes of carbon\r\nmonoxide which it leaves when its force is spent. While others,\r\nperchance the most unfortunate of all, are saved for a time, but, being\r\nimprisoned by falls from the roof and walls, die a lingering death of\r\nhunger and slow suffocation. A colliery explosion is one of the\r\nghastliest events imaginable, the only relief from which is the noble\r\nheroism with which the survivors, from the mine managers to the humblest\r\nworkmen, crowd round the pit-mouth, eager to risk their own lives for\r\nthe faint chance of saving some below. Not infrequently these brave\r\nvolunteers only share the fate of the men they would rescue.\r\n\r\nNow all that, as I have said, used to be put down to the effect of the\r\nfire-damp. But it dawned upon men's minds some years ago that the damage\r\nseemed to be out of proportion to the power of the gas. Modern mines are\r\nwell ventilated by large fans, which impel great volumes of air through\r\nall the workings. The air currents are cunningly guided by partitions or\r\n\"brattices,\" so that every nook and corner shall be scoured out by the\r\nplentiful draught of pure fresh air. Consequently the amount of\r\nexplosive gas which can collect in any one place is but small. How,\r\nthen, can so small a volume of gas do so large an amount of damage?\r\n\r\nCoupled with this was the fact that explosions take place in flour\r\nmills, where there is no gas, and experimenters had found in their\r\nlaboratories that almost any burnable substance, _if ground up finely\r\nenough_ and blown into a cloud, would explode. Coal-dust would naturally\r\ndo this. Indeed anyone throwing the dust from the bottom of the\r\ncoal-shovel upon a fire will see for himself how, quickly such dust\r\nwill burn, and, as has been pointed out in an earlier chapter, an\r\nexplosion is but rapid burning.\r\n\r\nSo the blame was largely transferred from the shoulders of the fire-damp\r\nto those of the clouds of coal-dust which collect throughout the\r\nworkings of a mine.\r\n\r\nBut then a difficulty arose from the fact that there is dust in all\r\nmines, yet some districts are quite free from explosions. And such\r\ndistricts are those where there is little or no fire-damp. These two\r\nfacts seem to be explainable in one way, and in one way only. It must be\r\nthat the gas first of all explodes feebly, and so, stirring up the dust\r\nlying along the roads and passages, prepares the way for the powerful,\r\ndeadly explosion of coal-dust which follows.\r\n\r\nBut that was only a guess, and the matter was of such importance that it\r\nneeded something more certain than mere assumption. So the Mining\r\nAssociation of Great Britain decided to have a series of experiments\r\nwhich should settle once and for all what part the coal-dust played in\r\nthese catastrophes, and how best they could be prevented.\r\n\r\nIt was at first thought that an old mine might be utilised for the\r\nexperiments, but there was the difficulty that such always become wet\r\nafter work has ceased in them, and so the dust would not behave\r\nnormally. Moreover, the work would be extremely dangerous and the\r\nresults difficult to observe. Then a culvert was suggested built of\r\nconcrete, partly buried in the ground, but that too was dismissed.\r\nFinally it was decided to make an imitation mine of steel, using old\r\nboiler shells with the ends taken out.\r\n\r\nThe sum of L10,000 was subscribed for the purpose by the coal-owners of\r\nGreat Britain, and the great work was carried out at Altofts, in\r\nYorkshire, close to a colliery where a terrible disaster occurred in\r\n1886.\r\n\r\nHere the great tube or gallery was built. Roughly the shape of a letter\r\nL, one leg is over 1000 feet long, while the other is 295\r\nfeet. The longer leg is 7-1/2 feet in diameter and the shorter 6 feet.\r\nAt the end of the shorter part a large fan is installed which can force\r\n50,000 to 80,000 cubic feet of air per minute through the structure, so\r\nproducing the conditions of a well-ventilated mine. The shorter length\r\nhas several sharp turns in it for the purpose of breaking the force of\r\nthe explosion along that part, and so shielding the fan from damage,\r\nwhile a tall chimney is provided there, so that, the door being shut to\r\ncut off the fan, the gases from the explosion can find a harmless way\r\nout.\r\n\r\nInside the tube, shelves are fixed along the sides so as to reproduce\r\nthe effect of the timbering in a real mine, upon the beams of which the\r\ndust finds lodgment. Props were put up too, just as they would be in the\r\nreal mine. Everything, in fact, was done to make the place as perfect a\r\nreplica as possible of actual underground workings.\r\n\r\nAnd then, added to this huge and costly structure, was an outfit of\r\nscientific instruments worthy of the important investigations which were\r\nto be carried on.\r\n\r\nTo grasp the purpose and working of these we need to remind ourselves of\r\nthe aims and intentions of the experiments. First of all it was desired\r\nto find out how various quantities and qualities of coal-dust behaved.\r\nThe dust was laid along the floor of the tube and along the shelves. A\r\nsmall gun fired at some point in the tube raised a cloud of this dust\r\njust as the gas explosion in the real mine would do. Then another gun\r\nwas fired to explode the dust-cloud. So far all is quite simple and\r\neasy. But to do that would be of no value without the means of finding\r\nout exactly what resulted from the explosion. And that is the function\r\nof the instruments.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, there is the great wave or tide of force or pressure\r\nwhich surges along the gallery immediately the cloud bursts into flame.\r\nHow fast does that wave travel? How long is it after the explosion\r\nbefore the shattering effects of it are felt a hundred yards away? To\r\nsolve that problem electrical contact-breakers are fixed at intervals of\r\nfifty yards along the gallery. Each of these consists of a cylinder with\r\na piston inside it something like, shall we say, a cycle pump. The\r\npiston, held down normally by a spring, is blown upwards by the force of\r\nthe explosion. The spring is adjustable, and so it can be arranged that\r\nthe feeble force of the gun cannot lift the piston, but the more\r\npowerful coal-dust explosion which follows can.\r\n\r\nThus when the explosion takes place these contact-breakers are operated\r\nin succession. The one nearest the seat of the disturbance is operated\r\nfirst; next the one fifty yards farther away; then the one a hundred\r\nyards away, and so on. The moments when they work will tell the speed at\r\nwhich the blast travels along the gallery. But it travels with great\r\nspeed, and so to measure and record the exact moment when each\r\ncontact-breaker is moved is a matter of no little difficulty.\r\nElectricity, however, makes this, like so many other things,\r\ncomparatively easy.\r\n\r\nThere is an apparatus used in astronomical observatories called a\r\nchronograph, which registers, within a small fraction of a second, the\r\nmoment when a star seems to pass across a wire in the \"transit circle,\"\r\nthe telescope by which the positions of stars are determined and the\r\nexact time kept. The observer sits with his eye to the telescope,\r\nwatching the apparent movement of the star. In his hand he holds a small\r\n\"push,\" pressure on which by his fingers operates a minute pricker,\r\nwhich acts upon a moving strip of paper. The paper travels along with\r\nthe utmost steadiness and regularity, while a clock drives a sharply\r\npointed pricker on to it every two seconds. Thus the clock marks out the\r\npaper into lengths, each of which represents two seconds. But the other\r\npricker, worked electrically by the observer's hand, also makes its mark\r\nupon the paper, and so, while the regular marks indicate intervals of\r\ntwo seconds, each irregular one marks the time of a transit or passing\r\nof a star across the wire. An examination of the strip subsequently\r\nenables the times of a transit to be seen with great accuracy, from the\r\nposition of the corresponding mark between two of the _regular_ marks.\r\n\r\nAnd the same principle was applied to the circuit-breakers of this\r\nartificial mine. Normally, current flows through the circuit-breaker,\r\nbut the lifting of the piston breaks the circuit (whence the name of the\r\ncontrivance), and that breaking of the circuit and consequent cessation\r\nof the current operates the chronograph. By a cleverly constructed\r\ndevice, the details of which are too complicated to set out here, each\r\ncircuit-breaker in turn makes its mark on the same strip, so that the\r\ndistances apart of these marks show the time taken by the force of the\r\nexplosion to travel fifty yards. Meanwhile the clock goes on making its\r\nregular marks (in this case every half-second), so that they form a\r\nscale by which the other intervals can be measured very exactly.\r\n\r\nThe chronograph used here is more accurate than that in use at Greenwich\r\nObservatory, the reason being that in this case the recording currents\r\nare sent mechanically by the contact-breakers operated by the explosion\r\nitself, while in the case of the astronomer the human element comes in.\r\nTo watch a moving speck of light and to tell exactly when it crosses a\r\nfine line is by no means easy, and so to tell the time within a tenth of\r\na second, is about the limit of possible accuracy. The instrument we\r\nhave been referring to, however, can register the time which a gaseous\r\nwave moving 3000 feet per second takes to travel fifty feet. In other\r\nwords, the circuit-breakers can be operated so fast that when only a\r\nsixtieth of a second intervenes between the action of one and that of\r\nthe next the chronograph can duly record the fact.\r\n\r\nThe records of the chronograph can be made in two ways: one by a pen on\r\na piece of paper tape, and the other by a scratch on a piece of smoked\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nSo by that means the progress of the \"force\" of the explosion can be\r\nmeasured. It is necessary also to time the movement of the \"heat\" of the\r\nexplosion, for the two may not travel together, and the difference\r\nbetween them may let in some light as to the nature and behaviour of the\r\nexplosion. So for this second purpose a second set of circuit-breakers\r\nare used. Each of these consists of a strip of thin tinfoil stretched\r\nacross the gallery. Being placed edgeways to the moving current of gas,\r\nthe force of the explosion has no effect upon it, but the heat instantly\r\nmelts it. Normally, current flows through the strip, and so the melting\r\nis signalised by the cessation of the current, which event is recorded\r\nby the chronograph.\r\n\r\nThus the speeds at which the force and the heat of the explosion travel\r\nare ascertained. Another important fact which needs to be found is the\r\namount of the force, or the pressure, at different points. For this\r\npurpose pressure-gauges can be connected to the gallery at the desired\r\nspots by means of flexible tubes. This flexible tube is necessary in\r\norder that the vibration of the steel shell, due to the explosion, shall\r\nnot be communicated to the instrument. The pressure, finding its way\r\nalong the flexible pipe, raises a piston against the force of a spring,\r\nand the distance to which it is raised forms, of course, a measure of\r\nthe pressure inside the gallery at the point to which the tube is\r\nconnected. The pressure is recorded by the action of the piston in\r\nmoving a style which just touches against the surface of a moving paper.\r\nThere are three styles in all marking this paper. The first is the one\r\njust mentioned. The second is held down on to the paper by an\r\nelectro-magnet energised by current flowing through a fine wire\r\nstretched across the gallery just where the explosion originates. This\r\nfine wire is broken at the moment of the explosion, whereby the current\r\nis cut off and the style raised. It therefore makes its mark until the\r\nmoment the explosion occurs, and then leaves off. The end of that line,\r\ntherefore, shows the time of the explosion. Meanwhile the first style is\r\ndrawing a straight line, but as soon as the pressure begins to be felt\r\nby the pressure recorder this style moves and the line slopes upward.\r\nUpward it goes as the pressure increases, until it has reached its\r\nheight, after which it descends, until the style is drawing a straight\r\nline once more. Thus the rise and fall of the line represents the rise\r\nand fall of the force of the explosion.\r\n\r\nThen comes the matter of time. How soon after the explosion occurred did\r\nthe pressure begin to be felt? How long did it take to reach its maximum\r\nand how long to die out again? These questions need answers which the\r\napparatus so far described does not give. True, the speed of the paper\r\nmay be known approximately, but all that I have described will occur\r\nwithin the space of a fraction of a second, and it is difficult to tell\r\nthe speed of the paper with sufficient accuracy. Therein we see the\r\npurpose of the third style. It is attached electrically to the\r\n\"tenth-of-a-second time-marker.\" This consists of a weight suspended at\r\na height. The force of the explosion lets it drop. The moment it starts\r\nto fall it causes the style to make a mark on the paper. When it has\r\nfallen a certain distance the style makes another mark. And the distance\r\nthat the weight falls between the making of the two marks is so adjusted\r\nthat the space between them on the chart represents exactly a tenth of a\r\nsecond. Thus a scale is formed upon the chart by which the other times\r\ncan be measured. There is the line terminating at the moment of\r\nexplosion; the straight line changing into an up-and-down curve,\r\nrepresenting the time and the variation of the pressure; finally there\r\nare the two marks representing a tenth of a second by which the other\r\nmarks recorded upon the chart can be interpreted.\r\n\r\nBut the mere pressure and velocity of the explosion form but a part of\r\nthe knowledge desired. How the explosion is formed, whether or not the\r\ncoal-dust is burnt up entirely, whether, indeed, it be the dust itself\r\nwhich burns or coal-gas given off by the dust under the heat of the\r\npreliminary explosion, what the gas is which is left by the explosion at\r\nvarious stages--these are important things to be known, and they can\r\nonly be ascertained by taking samples of the gases in the gallery at\r\ndifferent moments during and after the explosion. To obtain these\r\nsamples bottles are used, but the question is how to get them filled at\r\njust the right time. Into the shell of the gallery holes are drilled,\r\nand to these the metal bottles or flasks are screwed, a pipe leading\r\nfrom the mouth of each bottle well in towards the centre of the gallery.\r\nThe end of this tube is closed by a cap of glass above which there\r\nstands poised a little hammer. Controlling the hammer is an electrical\r\ndevice called a \"contact-maker,\" so arranged that just at the desired\r\nmoment the hammer falls, breaking the glass, and admitting a sample of\r\nthe gas in the gallery, the bottle and its tube having previously had\r\nthe air exhausted from them, so that on the glass being broken the gas\r\nis sucked in.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment a weight falls, attached to the end of a cord, and\r\nthis, on reaching the end of its tether, closes the end of the tube, and\r\nthe sample is imprisoned until such time as the bottle can be\r\ndisconnected and taken away to the laboratory for its contents to be\r\nanalysed.\r\n\r\nThe contact-makers are of two kinds. In one the pressure of the\r\nexplosion raises a piston which completes a circuit allowing current to\r\nflow through the very fine wire which prevents the fall of the hammer.\r\nThis fine wire being fused by the current, the hammer falls and does its\r\nwork. The other kind, which are used when the force of the explosion is\r\nnot enough to raise a piston, is operated by one of the tinfoil\r\ncircuit-breakers. A magnet, being energised by current passing through\r\nthe foil, holds up a curved bar over two cups of mercury. Broken by the\r\nheat of the explosion, the foil cuts off this current, de-energises the\r\nmagnet, and allows the bar to fall with its ends in the mercury. This\r\ncompletes another circuit, permitting current to pass to the fine wire,\r\nwhereby the hammer is released. By connecting a bottle to a\r\ncontact-maker at a distance the sample can be obtained at any desired\r\nperiod of the explosion. If, for instance, the sample is to represent\r\nthe immediate products of combustion, it is placed near to the\r\ncontact-maker. Then the sample is drawn in practically at the moment of\r\nexplosion. If, on the other hand, it is the after-damp that is to be\r\nsampled, then the bottle would be connected to a contact-maker a long\r\nway from the seat of the explosion, with the result that its glass cap\r\nwould not be broken until some considerable time had elapsed after the\r\nexplosion has passed the bottle. The time also during which the bottle\r\nis drawing in its sample can be adjusted by varying the length of the\r\ncord to which the weight is attached.\r\n\r\nAnd last of all must be mentioned the employment of a kinematograph,\r\ncapable of taking twenty-two photographs per second, for observing the\r\neffects at the ends of the gallery (see illustrations).\r\n\r\nThus records are obtained of the force and heat of the explosion, its\r\nmechanical and thermal effects upon the walls of the gallery, or, if it\r\nwere in a real pit, the effects which it would have in shaking and in\r\nheating the workings, and the men labouring in them. This and the\r\nanalysis of the gases producing and produced by the explosion, derived\r\nfrom the contents of the bottles, give sound data upon which can be\r\nbuilt up reliable theories as to the nature of colliery explosions and\r\nthe way to prevent them, results which could be obtained in no other\r\nway. No one can help being struck with the thoroughness and ingenuity of\r\nthe means adopted to these ends, and it is no exaggeration to say that\r\nit is a splendid example of thoroughly scientific methods applied to an\r\nimportant industrial investigation. It will be interesting to conclude\r\nthis account with a brief mention of some of the results to which these\r\npainstaking efforts have led.\r\n\r\nFirst in importance the fact is placed beyond doubt that coal-dust,\r\nwhich in bulk will only burn slowly, will, when well mixed with air,\r\nexplode. And no combustible gas need be present to aid in the explosion.\r\n\r\nThe dust-raising gun, by blowing some dust into a cloud which was\r\nignited by the second gun, caused an explosion powerful enough to do all\r\nthe damage experienced in the most disastrous natural explosions. So it\r\nis practically certain that the function of the gas is but that of the\r\nfirst gun, to raise the cloud of dust.\r\n\r\nA typical experimental explosion may be briefly described. On the\r\ncloud-raising gun being fired a small cloud of dust was driven out of\r\nthe ends of the gallery, even that end at which the fan was blowing air\r\n_in_. In other words, the current of air was checked, even reversed, by\r\nthe preliminary shock. This cloud was, of course, shown by the\r\nkinematograph.\r\n\r\nThen when the second gun was fired, and the real coal-dust explosion\r\noccurred, there was first a cloud of dust shot out larger than the other\r\none, to be followed by a cloud of flame 180 feet long. These also were\r\nrecorded by the kinematograph. The sound was heard seven miles away.\r\n\r\nPressures as high as 92 lb. per square inch were recorded, and the force\r\nof the blast was found to travel well over 2000 feet per second.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, strange to say, the effects were very slight at the seat\r\nof the disturbance, the force seeming to increase as the wave travelled\r\nalong the gallery. Probably the dust had not time to burn completely but\r\nonly partially at the first onset. Where props or timbers checked the\r\nflow of the flaming gases there the damage was most, for no doubt the\r\neddies caused the air and coal to be particularly well mixed at such\r\npoints. An encrustation of coke was found on the sides and the timbers\r\nafter all was over, probably because there was not sufficient air to\r\nburn all the dust, and some was only heated into coke to be deposited on\r\nthe nearest surface, where the tarry matters would make it stick.\r\n\r\nFinally, the most important, perhaps, of all, it was demonstrated that\r\nan admixture of stone-dust with the coal-dust made it non-inflammable.\r\nIf a small zone were treated in this way, stone-dust being mingled with\r\nthe other, the explosion became stifled at that point. True, the\r\npoisonous after-damp swept on beyond, so that men there might have been\r\npoisoned by it, but the stone zone would certainly save them from the\r\ndirect effects of the blast. If, however, stone-dust be mingled with\r\ncoal-dust all along the gallery, then no explosion at all would occur,\r\nagain proving that it is the coal-dust which does the damage.\r\n\r\nIn the colliery adjoining the experimental gallery this plan had been in\r\nuse for years. Soft shale is ground to fine powder, and is sprinkled\r\nwherever coal-dust has collected. It is just strewn by hand, giving the\r\nworkings the appearance of having been roughly whitewashed. And since\r\nthat has been done there has been no explosion in that pit. The\r\nexperiments showed beyond doubt that that was no chance occurrence. They\r\nshowed that in some way not thoroughly understood this addition of\r\nstone-dust renders the coal-dust harmless. It may be that it merely\r\ndilutes it. It may be that in some way it takes some of the heat and so\r\nprevents the coal particles becoming hot enough. It may be that, being a\r\nlittle heavier, it checks the formation of the dust-cloud. However that\r\nmay be, there is no doubt now that stone-dust is the salvation of the\r\nminer so far as explosions are concerned.\r\n\r\nWater sprinkled upon the coal-dust, by laying it and keeping it from\r\nforming a cloud, has the same effect, but it is less convenient, for the\r\nsimple reason that water evaporates, while stone-dust stays where it is\r\nput.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE MOST STRIKING INVENTION OF RECENT TIMES\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably no invention has made such a sensation during recent years as\r\nwireless telegraphy. And since it is the direct outcome of the most\r\nabstruse, purely scientific investigations, there could be no more\r\nappropriate subject for a place in this book.\r\n\r\nFor many years there has been a belief in the existence of a mysterious\r\nsomething to which has been given the name of \"The Ether.\" Totally\r\ndifferent, it should be noted, from the chemical of the same name, it is\r\nentirely a creature of the intellect. None of our senses give us the\r\nslightest direct indication of its existence. No one has either seen,\r\nfelt, heard, smelt or tasted it. Yet we feel that it must exist, for the\r\nsimple reason that some things which our senses do tell us of are\r\nutterly inexplicable without it.\r\n\r\nIt was originally thought of in connection with light. Standing at night\r\nupon the top of a hill, we see the lights of a town a mile away. How is\r\nit that those distant gas or electric lamps affect our eyes? They are a\r\nmile away; and the idea that one object can affect another _at a\r\ndistance_ is one which the human mind refuses to accept. We feel\r\ncompelled to believe that there is something in contact with the source\r\nof light which is affected first, and through which the disturbance,\r\nwhatever it may be, is conveyed to our eyes, with which it must also be\r\nin contact. We feel that there must be a something stretching from our\r\neyes to the distant objects, by which the light is carried. Of course\r\nthe air fills the space referred to, but that cannot be the carrier of\r\nlight, for if we look through a glass vessel from which the air has been\r\nexhausted we see distant objects undimmed. We also have good reason to\r\nbelieve that the air belongs specially to our globe, and does not extend\r\nupwards for more than a few miles. Consequently it cannot be air which\r\nbrings sunlight and starlight. We are forced to fall back, therefore,\r\nupon the belief in something, of which we have no other knowledge, which\r\nmust fill all the vacant spaces in the whole universe, passing, even,\r\nbetween the particles of which ordinary matter is composed, reaching as\r\nfar as the remotest star, able to penetrate everything, and consequently\r\nnot excludable from the most perfect vacuum. It is something so\r\ndifferent from anything of which we have any direct knowledge that one\r\nis tempted sometimes to doubt whether there must not be some other\r\nexplanation of light. In order to transmit light at the speed at which\r\nwe find that it does in fact travel, the ether must be more rigid than\r\nthe hardest substance we know of. Many, many thousand times more rigid,\r\nindeed. Yet it seems to offer no resistance to the passage of the\r\nplanets through it. Still, there is no other alternative, so far as men\r\ncan conceive, and we are compelled, therefore, to believe in the\r\nexistence of the ether.\r\n\r\nThe first things discovered by the telescope were the larger satellites\r\nof Jupiter. With that precision for which astronomers are noted, they\r\nsoon drew up time-tables, showing not only the past movements of these\r\nbodies, but also their future ones. They were soon puzzled, however, by\r\nthe obvious fact that the moons of Jupiter were not working according to\r\nschedule, to use a railway expression. They got later and later for a\r\ntime, and then gradually quickened up until they got too fast. Then they\r\nslowed down again. This repeated itself, and is going on still, with\r\nthis difference, however, that the cause has been discovered and the\r\nschedules amended accordingly. The solution of the puzzle was that when\r\nthe earth and the great planet are on the same side of the sun they are\r\nsome 186 millions of miles nearer together than when they are on\r\nopposite sides of the sun. The evolutions of the satellites are quite\r\nregular, according to the astronomers' calculations, but they seemed to\r\nthe earthly astronomers to vary, because of the time which light took to\r\ntraverse that 186 millions of miles. When the two bodies were nearest\r\ntogether the occurrences seemed to happen about 1000 seconds (16\r\nminutes) earlier than when they were farthest apart. Consequently it\r\nbecame evident that light took 1000 seconds to travel 186 million miles,\r\nor that, in other words, it moved at the prodigious speed of 186\r\nthousand miles per second. That discovery was, of course, many years\r\nago, but experiments since have proved the figure mentioned to be about\r\nright.\r\n\r\nIt put beyond question the fact that the action of a distant light upon\r\nthe eye was not an \"action at a distance,\" for such action, were it\r\npossible, would take effect at once. Seeing that light passed from the\r\ndistant satellites at a definite velocity, and took a certain time to\r\nreach us, it was evident that it was, during that time, passing through\r\na medium of some sort, and that medium must be the ether, for no\r\nalternative explanation will suffice.\r\n\r\nSo it became recognised that light really consists of waves or\r\nundulations of some sort in the ether; that a distant, luminous body set\r\nthese waves going; that they travelled with a definite velocity, and\r\nthen, striking our eyes, produced the sensation known as light. Many\r\nthings were found out about light in the years which followed the\r\ndiscovery of its velocity. The lengths of the waves were\r\nascertained--that is to say, the distance from the crest of one to the\r\ncrest of the next. The different lengths were sorted out and found to\r\ngive rise to different colours, while longer waves, which produced no\r\nsensation of light, were found to carry heat, thereby explaining how the\r\nheat reaches us from a distant fire, or from the sun.\r\n\r\nOf the actual nature of the waves, however, little was known, although\r\nthere was a vague idea that they were connected in some way with\r\nelectricity, at which point in the story there comes in the famous name\r\nof James Clerk Maxwell, a professor of Cambridge University, who in\r\n1864 produced before the Royal Society the explanation of the nature of\r\nthe waves and their connection with electricity and magnetism. That in\r\nitself was a wonderful achievement, but far more wonderful still is the\r\nfact that he truly predicted the existence of longer waves than any then\r\nknown, which no one knew how to cause, or how to detect if caused. That\r\nprediction has since been fulfilled. The long waves have been found; we\r\nknow how to make them and how to perceive their presence. They are the\r\nmessengers which carry our wireless messages.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of these, at that time unknown waves, on paper, by simply\r\ncalculating and reasoning about them, is more marvellous even than the\r\nfeat of Adams and Le Verrier in discovering a planet on paper before\r\nanyone had seen it. It established Maxwell among the heroes of science\r\nfor all time.\r\n\r\nA magnet acts upon a piece of iron some distance away. The pull must be\r\ntransmitted through some kind of ether. A current of electricity behaves\r\nin the same way, acting precisely as a magnet, with power to affect\r\nthings at a distance. Again an ether is necessary. A dynamo works by\r\nmoving a magnet past a wire which it does not touch, thereby generating\r\ncurrent in it. There again an ether is necessary to transmit the effect\r\nfrom the one to the other.\r\n\r\nTaking, then, the known magnetic effects of an electric current and the\r\nelectrifying effects of magnets, he was able to show that the same ether\r\naccounted for all, and for the transmission of light as well, that, in\r\nfact, there was but one ether which performed all these various duties.\r\n\r\nHe proved from the known facts about electricity and magnetism that\r\nwaves such as he imagined would, in fact, move with the speed of light.\r\nAnd once knowing the nature of the waves, he asserted that in all\r\nprobability there were others of which men had then no practical\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nMaxwell's theory soon set experimenters searching for the means of\r\nproducing the long waves which he had predicted would be found.\r\n\r\nSeveral authorities had before then stated their belief that the current\r\nderived from a Leyden jar was not simply a flow in one direction. They\r\nsuggested, and gave grounds for the belief, that the current surged to\r\nand fro for some time before it settled down; that it swung to and fro,\r\nindeed, like a pendulum.\r\n\r\nThere may be some of my readers who are unacquainted with this\r\ninteresting piece of electrical apparatus the Leyden jar. It is a\r\nconvenient form of what is called an electrostatic condenser. This is\r\ntwo conductors, generally in the form of two plates with an insulator\r\nbetween them. In the Leyden jar the insulator is a glass jar, while the\r\n\"plates\" are coatings of tinfoil, one inside and the other outside. On\r\nconnecting one coating to one pole of a battery, and the other to the\r\nother pole, they become charged, one positively and the other\r\nnegatively. One, that is, acquires an excess of electricity, while the\r\nother becomes deficient to an exactly similar extent. When the two are\r\nafterwards connected by a wire the surplus on one flashes through it to\r\nmake good the deficiency on the other.\r\n\r\nRushing first of all from positive coating to negative, electrical\r\ninertia causes it to overshoot the mark and to recharge the jar with the\r\ncharges reversed. Then current begins to flow back again, doing the same\r\nseveral times over, until at last equilibrium is established.\r\n\r\nThe power to absorb and hold a charge of electricity, which is the\r\ncharacteristic of a condenser, is called \"capacity.\"\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is \"electrical inertia\"? I have already referred to the\r\neffect which the creation of a magnetic field around a current has upon\r\nneighbouring conductors. It also has an effect upon itself. As soon as\r\nthe current begins to flow it builds up the magnetic field, and in the\r\nprocess some of its energy is exhausted. On the original current\r\nceasing, however, the magnetic field collapses back on to the conductor\r\nonce more and in so doing restores that energy. This occurs whenever\r\ncurrent flows, but it is specially noticeable in long conductors, like\r\nsubmarine cables. In them the battery has to act for a considerable time\r\nbefore any current reaches the farther end. It is in the meantime\r\nemployed in building up the magnetic field around the wire. Then when\r\nthe battery has ceased to act the current still comes flowing out at the\r\nfarther end--the magnetic field is giving back the energy expended upon\r\nit. Thus a current is reluctant to start flowing through a conductor,\r\nand, having started, is disinclined to stop. This is called\r\n\"inductance,\" and it has exactly the same effect upon the current that\r\ninertia has upon a body. What inertia is to a material body inductance\r\nis to an electric current.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, the resistance which the conductor offers to the passage of\r\nthe current is precisely analagous to the friction of the water in a\r\npipe.\r\n\r\nSo, we see, the \"capacity\" of the two coatings of the jar and the\r\ninductance which occurs in the connecting wire cause the current to\r\noscillate to and fro for a while when the jar is discharged, which\r\nsurging or oscillation is ultimately stopped by the resistance of the\r\nwire. The two coatings and the wire form what is called an oscillatory\r\ncircuit.\r\n\r\nWe can now resume our story.\r\n\r\nAfter much experimenting Hertz, of Carlsruhe, discovered the fact that\r\nwhen a discharge was taking place in an oscillatory circuit tiny sparks\r\npassed between the ends of a curved wire held some distance away. His\r\napparatus is illustrated in Figs. 6 and 7. The former, which is termed\r\nnowadays a \"Hertz Oscillator,\" is simply two metal discs almost\r\nconnected by a thick wire. The wire is broken, however, at the centre,\r\nand the two halves terminate in two metal balls. Each ball is connected\r\nto one terminal of an induction coil. Now the current comes from an\r\ninduction coil in a series of spurts. It is not an alternating current\r\nexactly (since every alternate current is so feeble as to be\r\nnegligible), but is practically an intermittent current always in the\r\nsame direction. Thus we may call one the positive end of the coil and\r\nthe other the negative. A short current comes along with every backward\r\nmovement of the little vibrating arm which forms a part of the\r\napparatus. This breaking of the \"primary\" circuit may take place perhaps\r\nfifty times per second, so that the intermittent \"secondary\" currents\r\nwill succeed each other at intervals of a fiftieth of a second, or even\r\nless. The brain reels at the attempt to think of a fiftieth of a second,\r\nbut it is really quite a long interval as these things go, and during\r\nthat interval quite a lot happens. For the current first of all charges\r\nthe two plates as a condenser.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--The apparatus by which Hertz made his\r\ndiscoveries, hence called the Hertz Oscillator. _a a_ are metal plates;\r\n_d_ is the spark-gap between the two metal balls; _b_ is the battery,\r\nand _c_ the induction coil.]\r\n\r\nWhen they are as full as they will hold the current overflows, as it\r\nwere, across the gap between the two balls.\r\n\r\nNow an air-gap--a gap that is filled with air, between two\r\nconductors--is a very strong insulator. But when current has once broken\r\nthrough it it becomes a fairly good conductor. Hence as soon as the\r\nfirst spark has passed between the two knobs the plates become connected\r\nalmost as if a wire were passed from one to the other. And there we have\r\nquite a good oscillatory circuit. There is capacity at each end and a\r\nfairly long length of wire to provide the inductance. Consequently that\r\nbreakdown of the insulation of the air in the spark-gap is followed by\r\nelectrical oscillations which take place with inconceivable rapidity.\r\nYet because of the resistance of the spark-gap, which is considerable\r\neven after it has been broken through, the oscillations do not continue\r\nfor long. They have died away long before the lapse of a fiftieth of a\r\nsecond, when the next impulse comes along from the coil. In the meantime\r\nthe air-gap regains its insulating properties, and so, on the arrival of\r\nthe next impulse, the whole thing occurs once more.\r\n\r\nThus a little train of oscillations is produced for every impulse from\r\nthe coil. Every train causes a corresponding disturbance in the ether,\r\nand sends off a train of electro-magnetic waves, and these, falling upon\r\nthe distant wire, generate in it a train similar to that which brought\r\nthem into being. These trains, in Hertz' simple apparatus, manifested\r\nthemselves in the form of minute sparks leaping across the small gap\r\nbetween the ends of the curved wire (Fig. 7).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Hertz \"Detector.\" It was with this simple\r\napparatus that Hertz discovered how to detect the \"wireless waves.\"]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1888 that Hertz made this discovery of a way to detect long\r\nelectric waves. He subjected the matter to many more experiments and\r\nfound that the waves have many points in common with light rays. He\r\nfound that they were reflected from certain surfaces, just as light is\r\nreflected from the surface of a mirror. He made prisms which were able\r\nto bend them as light waves are bent by a prism of glass. Some things\r\nappeared to be transparent to them, as clear glass is to light, while\r\nothers are opaque. It does not follow that the same things which reflect\r\nlight waves reflect electric waves, and so on. The latter can pass\r\nthrough a brick wall, for example. But the same divergence is to be\r\nobserved between light and radiant heat, of which the action of glass is\r\na familiar example. Clear glass will let light through almost undimmed,\r\nyet we use it for fire-screens to shield us from too much radiant heat.\r\nThe important fact is that all three--light, radiant heat and Hertzian\r\nwaves--in addition to travelling at the same speed, are reflected,\r\nabsorbed or refracted, according to precisely the same principles. This\r\nis almost perfect testimony to their essential identity.\r\n\r\nThe difference between them, as has been said already, is the distance\r\nfrom crest to crest of the waves--the \"wave-length,\" that is. And the\r\nreader will wonder by what manner of means this mysterious dimension can\r\nbe ascertained. In spite of its seeming mystery the method is very\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\nIt is based upon the fact that two sets of similar waves travelling at\r\nthe same speed in opposite directions interfere with one another in a\r\npeculiar way. Suppose that one set of waves travel along to a reflector\r\nand strike it vertically; then another set will travel back from the\r\nreflector exactly similar to the first, except that their direction will\r\nbe opposite. And the result will be that at certain intervals they will\r\nexactly neutralise each other, so that at those points there will be no\r\nwave-action appreciable at all. Those points where no action is to be\r\nperceived are called \"nodes,\" and they are exactly half a wave-length\r\napart.\r\n\r\nThis will be quite easily understood from the accompanying diagrams. In\r\neach of these diagrams the set of waves marked _a_ are supposed to be\r\nmoving from left to right, while those denoted by _b_ are reflected back\r\nand are moving from right to left. It will be noticed that each wavy\r\nline has a straight line drawn through it, dividing it into alternate\r\ncrests and hollows, which line is known as the axis of the waves.\r\n\r\nNow notice that in Fig. 8 there are points marked x, where\r\nthe _a_ waves are just as much above the axis as the _b_ waves are below\r\nit, and vice versa. Hence at those points the two sets of waves will\r\nneutralise each other.\r\n\r\nNow turn to the next figure, which, be it remembered, shows the same\r\nwaves a moment later, when they have moved a little farther on in their\r\nrespective journeys, and it will be seen that there, too, are places\r\nmarked x where the two sets of waves neutralise each other. And the same\r\nwith the third diagram.\r\n\r\nAnd finally observe that the places marked x are always\r\nthe same in all the diagrams--that is to say, they are always the same\r\ndistance from the line on the right-hand side, which denotes the\r\nreflector. It will be clear, too, that each node is half a wave-length\r\nfrom the next.\r\n\r\nThus it can be shown that at every moment, and not merely at the three\r\nindicated in the diagrams, the two sets neutralise each other at the\r\nnodes, that the nodes are always in the same places and half a\r\nwave-length apart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 8, 9 and 10.--These diagrams help us to see how the\r\n\"wireless waves\" are measured. The _a_ waves are supposed to be moving\r\nfrom left to right and the _b_ waves from right to left. At the points\r\nmarked x they neutralise each other. It is then easy to\r\ndiscover those points and the distance apart of any two adjacent ones is\r\nhalf the \"wave-length.\"\r\n\r\n_N.B._--In Fig. 10 the _b_ waves fall exactly on top of the _a_ waves.]\r\n\r\nEverywhere else, except at the nodes, there is action more or less\r\nenergetic, but _there_ is perpetual calm.\r\n\r\nBut how can we tell where the nodes are? When we recollect that they are\r\npoints at which no wave-motion at all takes place it is easy to see that\r\nwe shall at those points get no spark in our detector. So what Hertz did\r\nwas to set his oscillator going so that it threw waves upon a reflecting\r\nsurface and then move his detector to and fro in the neighbourhood until\r\nhe found the nodes. Between the nodes, as will be seen by an inspection\r\nof the curves once more, there are other points at which the wave-action\r\nwill be twice as great as with the single wave, and so at those points\r\nthe response of the detector would be especially energetic.\r\n\r\nThis mutual action between an incident wave and a reflected wave is\r\ntermed \"interference,\" and by it the wave-lengths of all the ethereal\r\nwaves have been measured. The plan used in the case of light waves,\r\nalthough the same in principle, is somewhat different because of the\r\nextreme shortness of the waves.\r\n\r\nSo the experiments of Hertz not only showed that long electric waves\r\nexisted, but that they were in all essentials similar to light, and\r\ntheir wave-lengths were ascertained. On that basis has been built up\r\nmodern wireless telegraphy.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to mention at this point a very curious, and in a\r\nsense pathetic, incident. Professor Hughes, whose name is associated\r\nwith certain well-known instruments for ordinary telegraphy, nine years\r\nbefore Hertz' discovery noticed that a microphone was affected by the\r\naction of an induction coil some distance away. He himself attached some\r\nimportance to the matter, but he allowed himself to be dissuaded from\r\nfollowing up the discovery by other scientists, more eminent than\r\nhimself at the time, who thought that it was not a promising field for\r\ninvestigation. But for the influence of these friends he would possibly\r\nbe the hero of this story in place of Hertz.\r\n\r\nProfessor Silvanus Thomson has said that he too noticed the sparks\r\nproduced at a distance when a Leyden jar was discharged, but he makes no\r\nclaim to precedence over Hertz, since, seeing the phenomenon, he did not\r\nperceive its real meaning, while Hertz, though a little later in time,\r\nrealised the profound significance of it.\r\n\r\nHertz himself in his account of his experiments is generous enough to\r\nassert that, had he not discovered the waves when he did, he is quite\r\ncertain that Sir Oliver Lodge would have done so.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to describe the principal apparatus used in the\r\nwireless station I should like to devote a little space to the\r\nexplanation of a term which will come up again and again, and which\r\nrepresents that which is responsible, in the main, for the marvellous\r\nadvances which the art of sending wireless messages has achieved in the\r\nlast few years. I refer to \"resonance.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be a great help if the reader will try for himself a simple,\r\ninexpensive little experiment. Stretch a string horizontally across a\r\nroom and on to it tie two other strings so that they hang down\r\nvertically a little distance apart. To the ends of the two strings tie\r\nsome small objects--a cotton reel on each will answer admirably. They\r\nwill thus form two pendulums, and, to commence with, they should be just\r\nthe same length. Having rigged all this up, give one pendulum a good\r\nswing. It will impart motion of a to-and-fro variety to the supporting\r\nstring, which in its turn will pass that motion on to the other\r\npendulum. In a very short time, then, the second pendulum will be\r\nvibrating like the first. Indeed the _whole_ motion of the first will\r\nshortly become transferred to the second, so that the second will be\r\nswinging and the first still. Then the second will re-transfer its\r\nenergy back to the first, and so they will go on until the original\r\nenergy given to the first pendulum is exhausted. The point to be\r\nobserved is the quickness with which one pendulum responds to the\r\nimpulses given it by the other, and the ease with which the energy of\r\nthe one passes to the other.\r\n\r\nNow reduce the length of one pendulum. On setting the first in motion a\r\ncertain irregular spasmodic action is to be observed in the second, but\r\nit is very different from the \"whole-hearted\" response in the previous\r\ninstance. In the former case the second one responded naturally and\r\nreadily to the first. Now its response is reluctant in the extreme. It\r\nmoves somewhat because it is forced to, but it is apparently unwilling.\r\nEnergy has to be _impressed_ upon it. There is no readiness, because\r\nthere is no sympathy between them.\r\n\r\nThat sympathy between the two equal pendulums is \"resonance.\" The same\r\noccurs between two violin or piano strings when they are \"in tune.\"\r\n\r\nThe explanation is that a pendulum has a certain natural frequency which\r\ndepends upon its length. Another pendulum of the same length, arranged\r\nas just described, therefore imparts impulses to it at just the\r\nfrequency which is natural to it. Consequently the effect is a\r\ncumulative one, and it responds quickly. Impulses at any other frequency\r\ntend more or less to neutralise each other. In the same way a string, of\r\na certain length and a certain tension, has a frequency peculiarly its\r\nown, and it will respond to another similar string because the other\r\ngives its impulses at its own natural frequency.\r\n\r\nIt is on record that an engine in a factory happened to run at precisely\r\nthe same speed as the natural frequency of the building, with the result\r\nthat after a little time the structure shook so much that it collapsed.\r\n\r\nNow electrical circuits in which currents oscillate have a natural\r\nfrequency of their own. That frequency depends upon the two electrical\r\nproperties of the circuit: capacity and inductance. And if you want to\r\nset up an electrical oscillation in any circuit you can best do it by\r\ngiving it impulses at intervals which agree with its natural frequency.\r\n\r\nSir Oliver Lodge seems to have been the first to appreciate fully the\r\neffects of resonance in wireless telegraphy. It is strange that in\r\nEngland the work of this eminent man in \"wireless\" matters is not more\r\nfully recognised. When wireless telegraphy reached the point at which\r\nthe public became interested, Marconi was just coming to the front and\r\nso, for ever, will his name be foremost in the public estimation. Indeed\r\nmore than foremost, for in the minds of many he monopolises the credit\r\nfor this invention. Many people are under the impression that he is the\r\none and only, or at any rate the original, inventor of wireless\r\ntelegraphy.\r\n\r\nNow Marconi has done exceedingly valuable work in this field. Moreover,\r\nhe has been the means of placing the affair on a good commercial\r\nfooting. But all the same he is by no means the original or only\r\ninventor. While admitting that he is a remarkable man, who has done\r\nwonders, it is only common justice to refer to the others whose\r\ncontributions to the solution of the problem are possibly of equal\r\nvalue. And, of these, few can compare with Sir Oliver Lodge.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the question of resonance. At first the distances over\r\nwhich messages could be sent were but small. Now a marconigram can be\r\nflung across a hemisphere. At first little could be done by day, work\r\nhad to be done mainly at night. Now communication passes by day and\r\nnight alike. Yet in principle, and in many details, the instruments are\r\nunaltered from what they were several years ago. The main source of all\r\nthis improvement is the use of resonance.\r\n\r\nTo enumerate broadly the apparatus used for the dispatch and receipt of\r\nmessages the following list will be useful:--\r\n\r\n_Transmitting End_\r\n\r\n     (1) An Antenna, consisting of a number of wires raised to a\r\n     considerable height above the ground.\r\n\r\n     (2) A Spark-gap, consisting of a series of metal balls with gaps\r\n     between them, the outer ones being connected to the antenna and to\r\n     the induction coil.\r\n\r\n     (3) A powerful Induction Coil with batteries or other source of\r\n     current to work it.\r\n\r\n     (4) A Telegraph Key, by which the induction coil can be started and\r\n     stopped at will.\r\n\r\n_Receiving End_\r\n\r\n     (1) An Antenna precisely similar to the other.\r\n\r\n     (2) A Coherer or other \"oscillation detector.\"\r\n\r\n     (3) A Receiving Instrument which may be a writing telegraph\r\n     instrument, a telephone, any of a number of ordinary telegraph\r\n     instruments, or a galvanometer.\r\n\r\nTransmitting and sending instruments are, of course, installed at both\r\nends and either of them can be connected to the antenna at will by the\r\nsimple movement of a switch.\r\n\r\nThe antenna plays the part of one of the metal plates in the Hertz\r\noscillator. Early experiments were made with Hertz apparatus, but the\r\nrange of such a contrivance is very limited. For one thing, it neglects\r\nto take advantage of the earth. It is little realised what an important\r\npart the earth plays in the carrying of wireless messages. A very great\r\nstep was taken when Marconi dispensed with one of the plates of Hertz,\r\nand used the earth instead; while the other plate gave place to the\r\nelevated wires, the most familiar part of the apparatus to most people.\r\n\r\nThe condenser is thus formed by the earth as one plate, the elevated\r\nwires as the other, and the intervening air as the insulator. The\r\n\"capacity\" must be exceedingly small in such an apparatus, but it is\r\nsufficient; while the long lines of electrical force stretching from the\r\nhigh antenna to the earth produce waves of great carrying power. Lastly,\r\nwhen the earth forms a part of the condenser the waves cling to it, so\r\nthat instead of being largely dissipated into space, they move along the\r\nsurface of the earth. The advantage of this is obvious.\r\n\r\nAt first it was customary to place the spark-gap in the wire leading\r\nfrom the antenna to the earth, as in the accompanying sketch. Later,\r\nhowever, it was found better to place the coil and spark-gap in a local\r\ncircuit in which the oscillations are first produced. These oscillations\r\npass through a coil which is interwound with another one connected to\r\nthe antenna and to earth, and thus the local oscillations, as we might\r\ncall them, induce similar oscillations in the antenna, just as the\r\nfluctuations in one part of an induction coil induce fluctuations in the\r\nother. Indeed the coil in the local circuit and the one in the antenna\r\ncircuit actually constitute an induction coil.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this is that by introducing condensers the capacity of\r\nwhich can be varied, and coils the inductance of which can be varied,\r\ninto the oscillation circuit it becomes possible to \"tune\" the circuits\r\neffectively. Thus resonance comes into play and the power expended can\r\nbe made to produce the maximum effect.\r\n\r\nSome attempts have been made to displace the induction coil in wireless\r\ntelegraphy altogether by a specially made dynamo. These machines can\r\nproduce either alternating or continuous currents, in fact the\r\nalternating current dynamo is really simpler than the more familiar\r\ncontinuous-current machine. The difficulty is, however, to run it\r\nsufficiently fast to produce sufficiently rapid alternations. Nicola\r\nTesla made an alternator (to give the alternating current dynamo its\r\nshort title) which could produce 1500 alternations per second, while Mr\r\nW. Duddell made one which produced 120,000, but neither was satisfactory\r\nfor the work in question. Could such a machine be made, it would be\r\ninvaluable, for it will be apparent that a continuous succession of\r\nwaves would be formed by it and not a succession of short trains of\r\nwaves such as is produced by the induction coil and spark-gap. The\r\ndifficulties are not electrical, but mechanical. It seems doubtful if a\r\nmachine will ever be made to run with sufficient rapidity which would\r\nnot knock itself to pieces in a very short time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--The simplest form of wireless antenna.]\r\n\r\nSmall alternators are used sometimes, however, to supply alternating\r\ncurrent to the primary of an induction coil, or transformer, as it is\r\nmore often called in its larger sizes. The interrupter is only needed\r\nwhen the primary current is continuous--from batteries, for example.\r\nAlternating current needs no interrupter, and so that bother is removed.\r\nThe alternations of a hundred or so per second, which are quite the\r\ncommon thing with alternators, are just what is needed to excite an\r\ninduction coil. Consequently small machines of this kind are to be found\r\nin many stations.\r\n\r\nA Danish inventor, Valdemar Poulsen, has adopted an altogether different\r\nmethod of producing electrical oscillations, which method is the\r\ndistinctive feature of his mode of telegraphy. He takes advantage of a\r\ncurious effect of passing current between two rods, one of which is\r\ncarbon, so as to form an arc such as we see in arc lamps.\r\n\r\nMy readers are already familiar with the term \"shunt\" in connection with\r\nelectrical matters, and so will perceive at once what is meant when a\r\nsecond circuit is said to be arranged as a shunt to the arc. The\r\naccompanying diagram will in any case make the matter clear.\r\n\r\nThe current comes along from the battery or continuous-current dynamo to\r\na hollow rod of copper which, to prevent it being melted, has cold water\r\ncontinually circulating inside it. Thence the current jumps across to a\r\ncarbon rod, forming an arc between the two rods, and returns whence it\r\ncame. In its journey it traverses the coils of an electro-magnet, the\r\npoles of which are one each side of the arc. This tends to blow the arc\r\nout, as a puff of wind blows out a candle, an effect which a magnet\r\nalways has upon an electric arc.\r\n\r\nThe shunt consists of a wire leading from the copper to the carbon rod\r\nwith a condenser and an inductance coil inserted in it. The latter coil\r\nalso forms one part of that coil by which the oscillations in the local\r\ncircuit are transferred to the antenna.\r\n\r\nThe electrical explanation of what happens when the current is turned on\r\nto an arrangement like this is rather too complex to set out here. It\r\ndepends upon a curious behaviour of the arc. It is really a conductor,\r\nyet it does not behave as ordinary conductors do, and the result is that\r\nthe continuous current flowing through the arc is accompanied by an\r\noscillating current in the shunt circuit. And the important feature of\r\nthe arrangement is that these oscillations are continuous, in one long\r\ntrain, not in a succession of trains. The advantage of this has already\r\nbeen referred to.\r\n\r\nOne other feature of the apparatus just described should be mentioned,\r\nsince it will seem curious to the general reader. For it to work\r\nproperly it is necessary that the arc should be enclosed in a chamber\r\nfilled with hydrogen or a hydro-carbon gas. Coal-gas is generally used.\r\n\r\nHertz' original discovery was that small sparks could be seen to pass\r\nbetween the ends of a curved wire when the electric waves fell upon it.\r\nSuch \"spark detectors,\" as they are called, are useful in the\r\nlaboratory, but not for practical telegraphy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Diagram (simplified) showing how Poulsen\r\ngenerates oscillations. Current from a dynamo flows through the arc,\r\nwhereupon currents oscillate through the condenser and coil (as\r\ndescribed in the text).]\r\n\r\nSeveral people seem to have noticed in years gone by that a mass of\r\nloose metal filings, normally a very bad conductor of electricity,\r\nbecame a much better conductor when an electrical discharge of some sort\r\noccurred near by. The demand for a wireless receiver had not then\r\narisen, however, and so the discoveries were not followed up.\r\nConsequently it remained to be rediscovered by Branly, of Paris, in\r\n1890. He placed some metal filings in a glass tube, the ends of which\r\nhe closed with metal plugs. Lying loosely together the filings would not\r\nconduct the current of a small battery from one plug to the other, but\r\nwhen a spark occurred not far away they suddenly became conductive and\r\nallowed it to pass. Several years after this Sir Oliver Lodge took up\r\nthe idea as a receiver for wireless messages, and believing that its\r\naction was due to the waves causing the filings to cling together, he\r\nchristened it \"Coherer.\"\r\n\r\nMarconi succeeded in making a very delicate form of this, although\r\nworking on strictly the same lines.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with a coherer is that when once it becomes conductive it\r\nremains so unless the filings be shaken apart. Lodge therefore arranged\r\nfor the tube to be continually struck by clockwork or by a mechanism\r\nlike that of an electric bell. Marconi effected a further improvement by\r\nmaking the current passing through the coherer control the striking\r\nmechanism, so that the latter is normally quiet but administers one or\r\ntwo taps at just the right moment.\r\n\r\nSir Oliver Lodge and Dr Muirhead devised another detector which, though\r\nquite different in form, is really much the same in principle. A steel\r\ndisc with a sharp knife-like edge is made to rotate above a vessel of\r\nmercury. The edge just touches the mercury but no more. On the top of\r\nthe mercury there floats a thin layer of oil, a bad conductor. Now as\r\nthe disc revolves it picks up on its edge a film of oil, which it\r\ncarries down into the mercury. The film adheres so tightly that it\r\nprevents the moving disc from actually touching the liquid metal. Thus,\r\nunder normal conditions, the two are electrically insulated from each\r\nother by the film of oil and no current can pass from mercury to disc.\r\nOscillations, however, caused by incoming electric waves, are able to\r\nbreak through the oil film and so bring disc and mercury into contact,\r\nwhereupon the current flows. The constant movement of the disc restores\r\nthe oil-film as soon as the oscillations cease.\r\n\r\nThe reason why these detectors act as they do is not quite understood.\r\nOne suggested explanation is that the oscillating currents heat the\r\nparticles and so partially weld them together. Another is that adjacent\r\nparticles become charged as the plates of a minute condenser, and so are\r\ndrawn tightly together as the plates in an electrostatic voltmeter are\r\ndrawn towards each other. Supposing that the original non-conductivity\r\nof the loose filings be due to the film of air which may surround them,\r\neither of these things would account for the film being broken or\r\nsqueezed out, resulting in better contact and improved conducting power.\r\nBut both suggestions seem to be contradicted by the fact that if the\r\npieces in contact be of certain substances the coherer works the\r\nopposite way. Under those conditions the conductivity is normally good,\r\nbut the influence of the incoming waves causes it to become bad.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 Professor Rutherford, now of Manchester, described some\r\ndiscoveries which he had made as to the magnetic effects of\r\noscillations. A simple little contrivance which he had constructed was\r\noperated by the discharge of a coil half-a-mile away, at that time a\r\ngreat performance. This detector was simply an electro-magnet with a\r\nsteel core instead of the usual soft iron core. The reason the latter is\r\nused in the ordinary magnet is that it loses its magnetism the moment\r\nthe current ceases to pass through the coil with which it is surrounded,\r\nwhile a steel core retains its magnetism. For most purposes a steel core\r\nwould render an electro-magnet useless, but in this case it was desired\r\nthat the core should be permanently magnetised. So a current was first\r\npassed through the coil to magnetise the core, and then the coil was\r\nconnected to a simple form of antenna while a swinging magnet was\r\nbrought near so that the magnetic power of the core would be indicated\r\nand any change made apparent. The effect of the discharge half-a-mile\r\naway was to _de_magnetise the core slightly. This was shown by the\r\nmovement of the swinging magnet, and so the first \"magnetic detector\"\r\nwas found.\r\n\r\nBut here, perhaps, I ought to explain the use of the antenna at the\r\nreceiving station--its function at the sending end has already been\r\nmade clear. The electro-magnetic waves, coming from the distant\r\ntransmitter, strike the receiving antenna and in so doing _set up in it\r\noscillations such as those which set them in motion_. For every\r\noscillation in the sending antenna there will be another, similar in\r\nevery respect except that it will be feebler, in the receiving antenna.\r\nAnd the oscillations are here led to the detector, of whatever form it\r\nmay be, and in it they make their presence felt.\r\n\r\nIn some few cases a Duddell thermo-galvanometer has been employed as the\r\ndetector, in which the oscillating currents report themselves directly.\r\nIn coherers the detector works by causing the oscillating currents to\r\ncontrol a continuous current from a battery and it is the latter which\r\nactually gives the signal, but there are a number of extremely\r\ninteresting means which have been invented to detect the oscillating\r\ncurrents by their heating effect.\r\n\r\nR. A. Fessenden, for instance, has perfected one which is a marvel of\r\ndelicate workmanship. He depends upon the heating of a wire by the\r\ncurrents passing through it. Such heating is the result of the\r\nelectrical force acting against resistance, and the difficulty is that\r\nif the resistance be great it will almost entirely kill the faint\r\noscillating forces in the receiving antenna, while if, on the other\r\nhand, it be small, the rise in temperature will be inappreciable. So he\r\nencloses a fine thread of platinum in a glass bulb from which the air is\r\nexhausted. The platinum wire is first of all embedded in a wire of\r\nsilver: the silver wire is given a core of platinum, in fact. Then the\r\ncompound wire is drawn down until it is so thin that the platinum core\r\nis only one and a half thousandths of an inch in diameter. A short\r\nlength of this compound wire is then bent into a U-shaped\r\nloop and its ends connected to thicker wires. Finally the bottom of the\r\nloop is immersed in nitric acid, which eats away the silver at that\r\npoint and leaves the bare platinum. Thus is produced a very short length\r\n(a few millimetres) of exceedingly thin platinum wire supported at its\r\nends by comparatively thick wires.\r\n\r\nBeing so short, this wire does not offer much resistance, and\r\nconsequently does not materially check the oscillations. At the same\r\ntime, since it is so fine, it does offer some resistance, and finally,\r\nsince what heat is generated will be in an exceedingly small space, it\r\nwill be appreciable there. A telephone is arranged so that its current\r\nalso passes through the fine wire, and every slight variation in the\r\ntemperature of the platinum wire, by varying its resistance, varies the\r\ncurrent through the telephone. And exceedingly slight variations can be\r\ndetected by sound in the telephone. Thus the oscillations generated in\r\nthe antenna affect the heat in the wire; that affects its resistance;\r\nand that again affects the telephone, which, finally, affects the ear of\r\nanyone who is listening to it. It must be understood, however, that this\r\nis not a wireless telephone, for the sounds heard are not articulate but\r\nmerely long and short sounds, representing the dots and dashes of the\r\n\"Morse Code.\"\r\n\r\nElectrolysis provides us with another form of detector. An exceedingly\r\nsmall platinum wire forms one electrode and a large lead plate the\r\nother, and both are immersed in dilute acid. The passage of current from\r\na local battery sets up electrolysis, and so stops itself by forming a\r\nfilm of oxygen on the small electrode. This film, however, is broken by\r\nthe oscillating currents from the antenna, so that as long as they are\r\ncoming the battery current can flow, but as soon as they cease the\r\nbattery current stops itself again. Thus the flowing and stopping of the\r\noscillating currents is exactly copied by the current from the battery,\r\nwhich current is led through a telephone or a sensitive galvanometer.\r\n\r\nIt may occur to readers to inquire why the oscillating currents are not\r\npassed direct to a galvanometer. The answer is that because they are\r\noscillating a very sensitive galvanometer is not possible.\r\n\r\nTrue, the Duddell thermo-galvanometer has been mentioned in this\r\nconnection, but although it is a beautiful instrument it cannot compare\r\nfor delicacy with the direct-current galvanometers. The latter are\r\neasily a _hundred thousand times_ more sensitive. But the trouble can be\r\novercome by \"rectifying\" the oscillating currents, by passing them\r\nthrough a \"unidirectional\" conductor--one, that is, which passes current\r\none way only. These remind one of a turnstile as installed at certain\r\npublic places, which let you out but will not let you in unless you pay.\r\nIn fact they will not let you _in_ at all. In like manner \"rectifiers\"\r\nwill only allow those currents to pass which are flowing in one\r\ndirection, and so they cut out every alternate oscillation, thus\r\nproducing something very like continuous current, which can be detected\r\nby the very delicate galvanometers which are usable where continuous\r\ncurrents are concerned, or more often by a telephone receiver. The\r\nrectifying conductors are in many cases crystals, hence these detectors\r\nare called \"Crystal Detectors.\" Carborundum is a favourite for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAnd that brings us to the important question of the secrecy of wireless\r\ncommunication, and the measures taken to prevent confusion from the\r\nnumber of independent messages flying through the air at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis can be largely achieved by the aid of resonance. Trains of waves\r\nflung out by one antenna may strike several other antennae, but unless\r\nthe latter are in tune with the sending apparatus they will probably not\r\nbe affected appreciably. Let one of them, however, be in tune, and it\r\nwill pick up easily the message which is not noticed by the others. It\r\nis as if three people watching a distant lamp were affected by a form of\r\ncolour-blindness which rendered them practically blind to all colours\r\nexcept one. Suppose one could see red only, the other blue and the third\r\nyellow. A light sent through a blue glass being robbed of all rays\r\nexcept the blue ones would be visible only to the man who could see\r\nblue. The man who could see blue would, in like manner, be quite blind\r\nto light sent through red or yellow glass. Each of them, in fact, could\r\nbe signalled to quite independently of the others by simply sending him\r\nrays of the colour to which his eyes were sensitive. In precisely the\r\nsame way each wireless receiver is or can be made most sensitive to\r\nwaves of a particular length and practically blind to all others. The\r\noperator can adjust his apparatus for certain prearranged wave-lengths,\r\nand so he can communicate with secrecy to stations whose wave-length he\r\nknows. The change, of course, is made by altering the capacity, or\r\ninductance, or both. The instruments can be so calibrated that it is\r\nquite easy to make the alteration.\r\n\r\nThen, antennae can be so constructed that messages can be received with\r\nmost readiness from one particular direction. In others, they can be\r\nreceived from any direction, but the direction can be discovered. This,\r\nit will be easy to see, is of great value to ships in a fog.\r\n\r\nAntennae made with a short vertical part and a long horizontal part\r\nradiate best in the direction away from which their horizontal part\r\npoints. This is of great advantage in stations which are built specially\r\nto communicate with other particular stations. In such cases the antenna\r\nis carefully built, so as to point in the required direction. Such\r\nantennae also receive more readily those signals which come from the\r\ndirection away from which they are pointing.\r\n\r\nReference has been made already to the interesting fact that wireless\r\ncommunication is easier at night than in the daytime. That is probably\r\nbecause of the \"ionisation\" of the atmosphere by the action of sunlight.\r\nAlong with the visible sunlight there comes to us from the sun a\r\nquantity of light known as \"ultra-violet,\" since it makes its effect\r\nknown in the spectrum of sunlight beyond the violet, which is the limit\r\nof visibility at one end of the spectrum. We cannot see it but it\r\naffects photographic plates powerfully. It has energetic chemical\r\npowers, and it has the ability to make the air more conductive than it\r\nis ordinarily. Comparatively little of it penetrates our atmosphere, but\r\nit must exercise a good deal of influence a little higher up. Now\r\nreaders will remember that the process by which electro-magnetic waves\r\nare propagated is checked when the waves strike a conductor. The energy\r\nin the waves is then employed in causing currents in the conductor\r\ninstead of forming more waves. And so partially conductive air forms a\r\npartial barrier to the waves. The effect is not appreciable in the case\r\nof the tiny waves of light and heat, but it is in the case of the long\r\n\"wireless waves.\" Everyone has seen the waves of an advancing tide\r\ncoming up a sandy beach, and has noticed how the dry sand (a good\r\nconductor of water) sucks up and destroys the foremost ripples. In like\r\nmanner are the wireless waves \"sucked up\" by the partially conductive\r\natmosphere. But the effect of the ultra-violet light does not last long,\r\nand so, at night-time, it disappears. Therefore messages can be sent\r\nbetter at night than by day.\r\n\r\nFor wireless _telephony_ what is wanted is a continuous uninterrupted\r\ntrain of waves, such as those from the \"Poulsen arc,\" and a receiver of\r\nthe magnetic type. The coherer is no good for this purpose, since it\r\neither stops the current entirely or lets it flow copiously. The\r\nmagnetic detectors, however, respond to the variations in the strength\r\nof the incoming waves. As the latter increase or decrease in strength so\r\ndoes the magnetic detector give out stronger or weaker signals. So a\r\ntelephone transmitter of the ordinary type is made to vary the strength\r\nof the oscillations at the sending end, while an ordinary telephone\r\nreceiver is placed in series with the detector at the receiving end.\r\nThus every slight variation corresponding to sound waves spoken into the\r\ntransmitter is reproduced in the receiver.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that wireless telephony has not made greater progress, for\r\nit may be said, on the word of one of the greatest authorities, that\r\nwireless telephony is simpler and easier than telephony through a\r\nsubmarine cable. In the latter there are almost insuperable obstacles\r\ncaused by the capacity and inductance of the circuit, while in the\r\nwireless method there is very little difficulty.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, several so-called \"systems\" of wireless telegraphy\r\nin use. There is the Marconi in Great Britain; the secret Admiralty\r\nsystem in the British Navy; the De Forest in the United States; the\r\nTelefunken in Germany, not to mention the promising Poulsen system. And\r\nthere are still others. But it would be futile to attempt to explain\r\nhow they differ from one another in a work like this. In principle they\r\nare alike. The precise forms of instrument used may vary, but even there\r\nthere is much in common between them. As time goes on there will\r\ninevitably be a tendency to more and more uniformity. That is always the\r\ncase, for some things are inherently better than others, and rival\r\nsystems, although each is working along its own lines, always come to\r\nvery much the same result in the end. Without making any comparisons, it\r\nis safe to say that if the Telefunken system, for example, has any\r\npoints of superiority over the Marconi, the latter will sooner or later\r\nfind out the fact, and will modify their apparatus accordingly. In all\r\nprobability this will operate both ways, and some things which the\r\nGerman system is now using will give place to those which the British\r\nhave in operation.\r\n\r\nIn another very modern industry this is very apparent. Having attended\r\nand carefully studied several annual exhibitions of flying machines, I\r\nhave noticed with great interest how the varying types of a few years\r\nago are merging into the more or less uniform types of to-day. And it\r\nhas been the same with wireless telegraphy, and will be still more so in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nThe best means of generating the waves and the best means of detecting\r\nthem at a distance--that is the whole problem, and all the workers in it\r\nwill sooner or later come to much the same conclusions as to which are\r\nthe best ways.\r\n\r\nPatents may do a little to delay this, but not much. For one thing,\r\npatents only last a few years. For another, a patent only covers a\r\nparticular way of doing a particular thing. A machine that is termed\r\n\"patent\" is often the subject of a hundred patents, each covering a\r\nparticular little point. It is well-nigh impossible to patent a whole\r\nmachine. A general principle cannot be patented, only a particular\r\napplication of that principle, and so there are in a great many cases\r\nlittle variations of a patented method which are quite as good as the\r\npatented one, and which can be used freely. So even patents will not\r\nhave much effect, in all probability, upon this unification process.\r\n\r\nBut, however that may be, there is no doubt that the whole world owes a\r\ndeep debt of gratitude to the men who have worked out this most\r\nbeneficent of inventions. It is difficult to think of a single one which\r\nhas ever brought such a load of benefits to poor, struggling humanity as\r\nthis has. The ship in distress, the lighthouse man on his lonely islet,\r\nthe explorer in the Polar regions, the pioneer settler in the new\r\nlands--in fact, just those who most need some connecting link with their\r\nfellows--are the people to whom the wireless telegraph brings aid and\r\ncomfort. All honour to the men who have done it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nHOW PICTURES CAN BE SENT BY WIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sending of a message by telegraph is easily understandable. Various\r\ncombinations of two simple signs, such as short sounds and long sounds,\r\ncan readily be made to indicate letters by which the words can be spelt\r\nout.\r\n\r\nNor does the sending of sound over a wire make a very great demand upon\r\nthe credulity. We all know that sound consists of innumerable little\r\nwaves in the air, and by the simplest of devices these can be converted\r\ninto variations in an electric current, which variations, by means\r\nequally simple, can be made to re-convert themselves back into sound\r\nwaves at the other end.\r\n\r\nBut to transmit a picture is another matter altogether. It seems barely\r\npossible in the case of a drawing such as a pen-and-ink sketch, which\r\nconsists of a comparatively small number of definite lines; but with a\r\nshaded sketch or a photograph, with its gradations of light and\r\nshadow--to transmit such would seem to be beyond the bounds of\r\npossibility, did we not know that it has been done. The description of\r\nthe methods will therefore constitute a not uninteresting subject for a\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that an attempt along these lines was made many\r\nyears ago by a man named Caselli, and a description of this pioneer\r\napparatus will form a good introduction to the later developments.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 13 we see a square which represents a sheet of tinfoil, upon\r\nwhich is drawn, in non-conductive ink, a simple geometrical figure. The\r\nink may be grease, or shellac varnish, indeed there are many substances\r\nwhich are available for use as an insulating ink. Across the square\r\nthere are a number of parallel dotted lines, but these, it must be\r\nunderstood, are not actually drawn upon the foil--their purpose will be\r\napparent in a moment.\r\n\r\nSuppose that we connect the foil to one pole of a battery, and the other\r\npole by a flexible wire to a metal pen or stylus. If we place the point\r\nof the pen in contact with the foil, we make a complete circuit, through\r\nwhich, of course, current will flow. But if, with it, we touch one of\r\nthe non-conductive lines, there will be no current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14]\r\n\r\nTaking a ruler, then, let us draw the point of the stylus across the\r\nfoil in a series of parallel straight lines. It is these excursions of\r\nthe stylus which the dotted lines are intended to represent. For nearly\r\nthe whole of the time current will be flowing; but whenever the stylus\r\nis crossing one of the lines of non-conductive ink there will be a\r\nmomentary cessation. Thus, the reader will begin to perceive, we obtain\r\nwhat we may call an electrical representation of the figure drawn upon\r\nthe foil.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us turn to Fig. 14. There, too, is a square, but in this\r\ncase it is not foil, but paper which has been soaked in prussiate of\r\npotash. The reason for introducing this chemical is that it is\r\nsusceptible to electrical action. Wherever current passes through it, it\r\nbecomes changed into Prussian blue, so that if we place the point of a\r\npen upon the paper, and cause current to flow out of that point through\r\nthe paper, there we get a blue dot. If, while the current is flowing, we\r\ndraw the pen along, we get a blue line.\r\n\r\nFig. 13 therefore represents in principle the sending apparatus of\r\nCaselli's writing telegraph, while Fig. 14 represents the receiving\r\ninstrument. The two pens are connected together by the main wire, in\r\nsuch a manner that, when the point of the one is in contact with the\r\nbare foil current flows out of the other and into the paper; but as the\r\nformer crosses an ink line all current ceases.\r\n\r\nIf, then, while the sending pen is drawn line by line across the foil,\r\nthe other is drawn at the same speed, line by line, across the\r\nchemically prepared paper, we shall get on the latter a series of lines\r\nas shown in Fig. 14 almost continuous, but broken here and there. Each\r\nbreakage represents a passage of the sending pen across a line, and\r\ntaken together, as will be seen, they constitute a reproduction of the\r\ngeometrical figure drawn upon the foil. As shown, the lines are rather\r\nfar apart, and so the reproduction is not a very good one. They are only\r\ndrawn so, however, in order that the principle may be shown the more\r\nclearly. They may be drawn so that they overlap, and then the effect is\r\nvery much better, the received picture being almost an exact\r\nreproduction of the other.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that an essential to the success of this method is\r\nthat the two pens should move in perfect unison, and that was the great\r\ndifficulty. Caselli used an arrangement of pendulums, the best thing\r\navailable at the time.\r\n\r\nThe reproduction is, in photographic language, a negative, a somewhat\r\nunsatisfactory feature of the method. A simple modification, however, of\r\nthe electrical connections will reverse that, so that the reproduction\r\nshall be a positive. There are two ways of cutting off a current from\r\nany particular circuit. One is to interpose a resistance, through which\r\ncurrent cannot pass in an appreciable quantity, and the other is to\r\nprovide a second path for the current so much easier than the first that\r\npractically all the current will pass that way, leaving the first\r\ncircuit, to all intents and purposes, free. It is as if a farmer wished\r\nto stop people passing across a certain field. Two methods would be open\r\nto him: one to put up a high gate over which no one would dare to climb,\r\nand the other to provide a short cut so much more pleasant and\r\nconvenient than the old path that no one having the choice of the two\r\nways would think of going the old way.\r\n\r\nWhat the farmer would call a short cut the electrician calls a short\r\ncircuit, and a short circuit is often a more convenient way of cutting\r\noff a current than a switch which interposes resistance. At all events,\r\nin a case like this, a short circuit enables that to be accomplished\r\nwhich would be very difficult by any other means.\r\n\r\nIn the apparatus as already described the battery had to drive the\r\ncurrent along a long wire, terminating at the distant receiving\r\ninstrument, whence the current returned via the earth. The foil and pen,\r\nacting as a kind of electrical \"tap,\" controlled this. When foil and pen\r\ntouched, the tap was open and current flowed. When the line of\r\nnon-conductive ink interposed itself, the tap was off and the flow\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nBut connect the battery directly to the wire, and place the foil and pen\r\nin a short branch circuit, and the whole thing is reversed. Then the\r\nopening of the \"tap\" sent current to the other end; now the opening of\r\nthe tap causes it to flow round the short branch and leave the main\r\nwire. Then the closing of the tap stopped the current reaching the\r\nfarther end; now it causes it to do so. In fact, the entire action of\r\nthe apparatus is completely reversed, and the bare parts of the foil\r\nbecome represented by blank paper, while the insulating lines produce\r\nthe marks. In short, a positive results instead of a negative.\r\n\r\nSuch was the scheme of Caselli years ago. It is mentioned here at some\r\nlength, since the principle of it is largely re-used in an improved\r\nform in the most successful of modern apparatus for a like purpose.\r\n\r\nIt undoubtedly was a very excellent scheme, simple and effective, which\r\nought to have succeeded; but it did not do so, for the sufficient reason\r\nthat at that time knowledge of electricity and skill in constructing\r\ndelicate mechanism were not so highly developed as they are to-day. For\r\nsuccess, as has already been said, one thing was essential, and that\r\nthing very difficult to obtain--a perfect synchronism between one stylus\r\nand the other. If the one were but the slightest degree \"out of step\"\r\nwith the other, failure followed inevitably.\r\n\r\nSo the electrical transmission of sketches dropped for the time being.\r\nMore recently a perfectly successful solution of the problem has come in\r\nanother way altogether. This apparatus, at first called the\r\ntelautograph, but now known as the telewriter, it will be more\r\nconvenient to refer to later.\r\n\r\nOf modern systems for the transmission of pictures the most successful,\r\nprobably, are the Korn telautograph and the Thorn-Baker telectrograph.\r\n\r\nBoth of these are able to transmit very fair reproductions of\r\nphotographs besides line drawings. The difficulty with photographs is,\r\nof course, that many parts of them are not of equal blackness or\r\nwhiteness, but shade off gradually from one into the other. Take the\r\ncase of a simple portrait. Part of the subject's face will be pure\r\nwhite, while the side in shadow will be comparatively dark. There is no\r\nhard and fast line between the two, but by a gradation through an\r\ninfinite number of shades the one tones into the other. How can it be\r\npossible to convey that, more or less mechanically, over a wire? The\r\nsolution is due to the fact that the eye will blend together a number of\r\ndistinctly different shades, if properly arranged, into a gradual\r\nchange. Really the change is step by step, but the effect is apparently\r\nquite continuous. This can be seen in the \"half-tone\" illustrations in\r\nthis book. Close examination will show that such a picture is cut up\r\ninto small squares. In the pure white part the squares are invisible,\r\nwhile in the perfectly black parts, if there be any, they are so merged\r\ninto one another as to be inseparable. But everywhere else in the\r\npicture it will be seen that there are squares each with a dot in the\r\nmiddle. In the darker parts the dots are large; in the lighter ones they\r\nare small. We get the effect almost of colour, although the picture is\r\ndone entirely in black ink. The eye does not see the individual dots\r\nwhen we are just looking at the picture; we have to examine it very\r\nclosely to find them. Yet they are there all the time, and it is simply\r\nthe peculiar action of the eye which sees beautiful half-tones, shading\r\nimperceptibly one into another, whereas in real fact there are only a\r\nvast number of equidistant dots, all equally black.\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, that it is possible to split up a picture of any kind\r\ninto a number of small squares and to treat each square as being of\r\nequal darkness throughout. Then, if we can communicate by wire that\r\nparticular degree of darkness to a distant station, where the small\r\nparts can be put together in their proper order and given their correct\r\nshade, the picture as constructed at the receiving end will be something\r\nlike that at the sending end. And we have only to make the size of each\r\nseparate square small enough to obtain a copy which will resemble the\r\noriginal very closely indeed.\r\n\r\nIn the early days it was actually proposed to telegraph pictures by\r\nordinary telegraphy, using this principle. The suggestion was to agree\r\nupon a code of twenty-six shades, each called by a letter of the\r\nalphabet. One shade was to be _a_, the next _b_, and so on. Then the\r\npicture was to be divided up into squares, and the particular shade of\r\neach square telegraphed by means of the corresponding letter. The shades\r\nthus communicated were to be put together at the receiving end, on a\r\nprearranged system, and so the picture was to be built up. Given plenty\r\nof time, that scheme might be moderately successful, but to get a really\r\ngood reproduction the subdivision needs to be so minute, and the number\r\nof squares, therefore, so immense, that it would be quicker to send the\r\npicture by train than to telegraph it by such laborious means. In a\r\nfairly coarse half-tone block the squares are, say, 2500 to the square\r\ninch. That number of letters would therefore have to be telegraphed for\r\nevery square inch of picture transmitted, to say nothing of the\r\ndifficulty of building up a picture of such a great number of parts and\r\ngiving to each the desired shade. That idea, abortive though it is in\r\nits crude form, illustrates very clearly the fundamental principle on\r\nwhich this work is done.\r\n\r\nThe problem is really to devise a machine which will do that same thing\r\nrapidly and automatically divide up the original into a large number of\r\nsquares, and then send an electric current to represent each square,\r\nsuch current by its strength to indicate the shade of the square: and\r\nfinally a similar instrument is needed to act as receiver, and to\r\nreproduce those squares in the proper order, giving to each its correct\r\nshade.\r\n\r\nIn practically all of them the mechanism is rotatory, the original being\r\nplaced upon a drum which turns round under a stylus, or its equivalent,\r\nwhile the stylus gradually travels along from end to end after the\r\nmanner of the needle of a phonograph, or else the same result being\r\nachieved by the drum itself having an endwise movement as well as a\r\nrotative one. The receiving instrument is of similar form, and both must\r\nstart together, move at the same speed and indeed preserve a perfect\r\ncorrespondence with each other.\r\n\r\nIf the distance be great between the two there may be difficulties due\r\nto the \"retardation\" of the currents passing between them. Electricity\r\ndoes not pass through long wires, particularly if they be under the sea,\r\nwith anything like the quickness which we are apt to think. Over a short\r\nline and under favourable circumstances the receipt of a telegraph\r\nsignal at the farther end is practically instantaneous, but on long\r\nlines, and under certain conditions, that is far from being the case.\r\n\r\nThen something has to be done to quicken the action of the current, or\r\nelse the receiving drum must be made to lag behind the sending drum by\r\nthe requisite amount. In some cases, too, the transmitting apparatus\r\nloses a little time in sending off the currents, and that, too, has to\r\nbe allowed for, so that, all things considered, the reader will see that\r\nthe successful solution of this problem is hedged about with many subtle\r\ndifficulties which are probably only appreciated by those who are well\r\nacquainted by sad experience with the little vagaries of both\r\nelectricity and mechanical devices. Neither of them does quite what we\r\nwant it to do; each suffers from little faults, which in the case of a\r\ndelicate problem like this, where a difference of a hundredth of a\r\nsecond would be fatal to success, introduce difficulties almost\r\ninsuperable.\r\n\r\nTo transmit line drawings, Professor Korn uses a sending instrument very\r\nlike that of Caselli. The picture is placed, either by hand or\r\nphotographically, upon a sheet of copper foil, which is fixed round the\r\nrotating cylinder, the lines being formed of non-conducting material.\r\nThe foil being electrified and the stylus connected to the \"line\" or\r\nmain wire, currents pass to the farther end just as in the old\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nAt the receiving end the drum is covered with photographic paper and\r\nenclosed in a light-tight box. Through a hole in this box a fine pencil\r\nof light passes from a lamp, suitable lenses being used to ensure that\r\nthe pencil shall have, as it were, a very fine point, producing a very\r\nsmall spot of light upon the paper. If the light remains quite steady,\r\nthe drum meanwhile rotating, a line will be drawn by it upon the paper\r\nwhich will be visible when the latter is developed. Since the drum not\r\nonly turns upon its axis, but also moves endwise one hundredth of an\r\ninch at every revolution, this line will be a spiral, the turns of which\r\nwill be one hundredth of an inch apart. Thus the paper will be blacked,\r\npractically uniformly, all over. Should the intensity of the light vary,\r\nhowever, the line will at times be lighter than at others, while, should\r\nit be cut off altogether for a moment, then there will be a\r\ncorresponding gap in the line, and it is easy to see that if these\r\nlighter parts or gaps occur in the correct places they will form a\r\npicture. In other words, by controlling that light we can build up a\r\npicture upon the paper. The question is how to control it.\r\n\r\nProfessor Korn uses a form of the Einthoven galvanometer already\r\ndescribed. Instead of the silvered fibre generally employed in this\r\ninstrument, a silver wire is fitted, the movement of which partly or\r\nentirely cuts off the pencil of light.\r\n\r\nThe Korn transmitter for photographs is quite different, although the\r\nreceiver is practically the same as what has just been described. The\r\nbasis of it is a peculiar power possessed by the metal selenium when in\r\na certain state. This, like all metals, is a conductor of electricity,\r\nbut of course offers resistance in some degree. Now the special feature\r\nof selenium is that its resistance is reduced if light shine upon it.\r\nSuppose, then, that current be flowing through a mass of selenium and\r\nthat the latter be suddenly illuminated brightly, the resistance will at\r\nonce fall and the current increase. On the other hand, should the light\r\nfalling upon the selenium diminish, its resistance will increase and the\r\ncurrent flowing through it will decrease. In short, given a suitable\r\narrangement, the current flowing in a circuit of which a selenium \"cell\"\r\nforms a part will increase or decrease with the increase or decrease in\r\nthe light falling upon the cell.\r\n\r\nA while ago the papers were telling striking stories of a way by which\r\nblind people, so it was said, were to be recompensed for the loss of\r\ntheir sight--a new sense, as it were, was to be given them by which they\r\ncould \"hear\" light, even if they could not see it. All this had\r\nreference to this curious property of selenium, it being, of course, an\r\nundoubted fact that it will vary an electric current in accordance with\r\nthe variations in the light, and if that current be led through a\r\ntelephone receiver a man, by holding that to his ear, could, in a sense,\r\nhear the variations in the light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:         THE TELEWRITER\r\n\r\nThis remarkable instrument transmits actual writing and drawings, the\r\nreceiving pen copying precisely the movements of the sending pen]\r\n\r\nIn the Korn transmitter for photographs selenium is employed as\r\nfollows:--A transparent photograph is made, on a celluloid or gelatine\r\nfilm, and this is fixed upon a glass cylinder mounted as already\r\ndescribed. A pencil of light falls upon this in much the same way as in\r\nthe case of the receiver just described, and, as the cylinder revolves,\r\ndescribes a fine spiral line all round and round it.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the light passes right through the photograph and falls upon a\r\nmirror inside, off which it is reflected on to a selenium cell. At every\r\nmoment, then, the light is falling upon some small part of the\r\nphotograph, and the amount of it which gets through and ultimately\r\nreaches the selenium depends upon the density of that part.\r\n\r\nCurrent, meanwhile, is flowing from a battery through the selenium, and\r\nthence over the main wire to the distant station. As the light pencil\r\ntraces its spiral path over the rolled up photograph every variation in\r\nthe density of the picture is reproduced as a variation in the current\r\nthrough the selenium. This, at the remote end, operates the Einthoven\r\ngalvanometer, the movements of which vary the shade of the spiral line\r\nbeing drawn upon the photographic paper.\r\n\r\nThis process takes place with remarkable celerity, so that in a few\r\nminutes the innumerable variations constituting a complete photograph\r\ncan be transmitted and faithfully recorded at the distant end of the\r\nwire.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most successful of these methods is that known as the\r\ntelectrograph. It is surprisingly like the scheme of Caselli in\r\nprinciple, and forms another example of the fact that good ideas often\r\nfail through lack of the proper means to carry them out. Mr\r\nThorne-Baker, the inventor of the telectrograph, has had at his disposal\r\naccumulated stores of knowledge and skill which did not exist in\r\nCaselli's time. Consequently the former has made a brilliant success\r\nwhere his predecessor produced only an interesting but somewhat\r\nineffective attempt.\r\n\r\nReference has been made already to the half-tone blocks wherein a host\r\nof small dots of varying sizes make up a picture. Now instead of\r\nparallel rows of dots parallel lines of varying thickness will give very\r\nmuch the same result. The former are made by photographing the picture\r\nthrough a sheet of glass ruled with two sets of lines at right angles to\r\neach other. The latter can be made by using a screen with lines one way\r\nonly instead of two ways. It is therefore quite easy for a blockmaker to\r\nproduce a \"process block\" wherein lines are used instead of dots. For\r\nthis particular purpose, however, it is not an ordinary block that is\r\nneeded, although it is in essentials very similar. The picture to be\r\ntransmitted is photographed through a screen as if a half-tone block\r\nwere to be made. The negative so obtained is then printed by the gum\r\nprocess on to a sheet of soft lead and, after washing, the picture\r\nremains upon the lead in the form of lines of insoluble gum on a\r\nbackground of bare lead. A squeeze in a press drives the gum into the\r\nlead, and so gives the whole sheet a smooth surface over which a stylus\r\nwill ride easily, but which is, nevertheless, made up of conductive\r\nparts and non-conductive parts, the latter forming the picture.\r\n\r\nThe lead sheet is then put upon a revolving cylinder and turned under a\r\nmoving stylus in the manner with which we are now familiar. The sheet is\r\nplaced with the lines lengthwise of the cylinder so that current passes\r\nto the stylus except as it passes over the breadth of the lines, and so\r\nsimilar lines are built up at the distant end.\r\n\r\nThe receiving mechanism is of the electro-chemical type which Caselli\r\nused. The current passes from the receiving stylus to the paper, and\r\nthere makes its mark in a way that will be understood from the\r\ndescription of the earlier apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe supreme advantage of this method of working, over that of Professor\r\nKorn, is that the operator can see what he is doing. To obtain good\r\nresults, a number of electrical adjustments have to be made, and whether\r\nhe has got them right or wrong can be seen as soon as the picture begins\r\nto grow upon the receiving paper. If a little readjustment be needed the\r\noperator sees it and can set things right before the really important\r\npart of the picture begins to appear, whereas with the Korn apparatus he\r\ndoes not know what is happening at all, since he can see nothing until\r\nthe picture is finished and the photographic paper has been developed.\r\n\r\nIt will be apparent, too, to anyone who has carefully considered the\r\nwireless telegraphy chapters, that it ought to be possible to make the\r\nsending stylus or its equivalent control a wireless transmitter and a\r\nwireless receiver to operate the receiving stylus, so as to be able to\r\nsend pictures by \"wireless.\" Experiments to this end have been made with\r\nsome measure of success, and sooner or later we are almost sure to hear\r\nthat the difficulties, which are by no means small, have been overcome.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot conclude this chapter without a fuller reference to that\r\nmarvellous invention, the telewriter.\r\n\r\nIn this a man makes a sketch with a pen on a piece of paper, or maybe he\r\nwrites a message, and simultaneously a pen, hundreds of miles away if\r\nneed be, does precisely the same thing. The receiving instrument draws\r\nthe sketch line by line, or it transcribes the message in the actual\r\nhandwriting of the sender. A little touch, almost weird in its\r\nnaturalness, is that every now and then the receiving pen leaves the\r\npaper and dips itself into a bottle of ink, after which it resumes its\r\nwork at the very spot where it left off.\r\n\r\nNow how the complicated lines and curves, the strokes and dots which\r\nmake up a written language, even the little shakes and defects which\r\ngive each man's writing a personality of its own, how all these can be\r\nsent over a wire is at first sight very difficult to understand. The\r\ninventor of this apparatus has discovered an extremely simple way of\r\ndoing it.\r\n\r\nBut even he does not attempt to do it with one wire, it should be said,\r\nfor he uses two. This is no drawback when, as is often the case, it is\r\nused in conjunction with a telephone, for the latter, to be effective,\r\nalso requires two wires. Years ago single wires were employed for\r\ntelephones as for telegraphs, the circuit being completed through the\r\nearth. But the difficulty arose that every wire through which currents\r\nflow is apt to induce currents in neighbouring wires--the induction coil\r\nis based upon that fact--and so messages in one wire were overheard on\r\nothers, or, what was perhaps more annoying still, the dots and dashes\r\npassing in a telegraph wire would produce loud noises in a telephone\r\nwire that happened to be near. The use of two wires, however, entirely\r\nremoves that trouble, for the neighbouring current then induces two\r\ncurrents instead of one, one in each, and it so happens that these are\r\nopposed to each other, so that they neutralise each other. So every\r\ntelephone wire now is double and therefore is ready, as it were, to have\r\nthe telewriter fitted to it.\r\n\r\nBut even with two wires the difficulty seems insuperable until we\r\nremember that the most complex of curves can be resolved into two simple\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nThe sending pen, with which the original writing or drawing is done, is\r\nattached to the junction of two light rods. The farther end of each rod\r\nis attached to the end of a light crank fixed so that it can rotate or\r\noscillate, after the manner of cranks, in the plane of the desk upon\r\nwhich the paper lies. All the joints mentioned are of the hinge nature,\r\nso that as the pen is moved about the rods turn, more or less, one way\r\nor the other, the two cranks. This simple mechanism, it will be\r\nobserved, carries out very effectively the principle just mentioned, for\r\nit resolves the motion of the pen, no matter how complicated it may be,\r\ninto a simple rotating motion of the two cranks.\r\n\r\nSo the cranks turn this way or that as the draughtsman makes his\r\npicture, and it is very easy to arrange that their movement shall vary\r\nthe strength of two electric currents, whereby we obtain electric\r\ncurrents varying in accordance with the movement of the cranks.\r\n\r\nThis is done by making each crank operate a variable resistance or\r\nrheostat. When in its extreme position on one side the crank permits\r\ncurrent to flow freely, but as it moves over to the other extreme\r\nposition the resistance in the path of the current is increased. Such an\r\narrangement is a common feature in electrical apparatus.\r\n\r\nSo current from a battery flows to the two wires leading to the distant\r\nstation, each passing through the rheostat connected to one of the\r\ncranks. We may think of the rheostats as taps which can be turned on or\r\noff by the action of the cranks. Let us imagine that crank _a_ is in the\r\nposition when the current flows freely--when the electrical \"tap\" is\r\nfully open; then a strong current will flow along wire _a_, returning to\r\nthe sending battery via the earth. As that crank is moved the current\r\nwill gradually be reduced, until, if it be moved right over to the other\r\nextreme, the current will be at its feeblest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--A Message received by Telewriter.]\r\n\r\nArrived at the other end, this current passes to a device which we may\r\ndescribe simply as a magnet so arranged that its action pulls round a\r\ncrank against the restraining action of a spring.\r\n\r\nNow the stronger the current the more does that magnet pull and the\r\nfarther does the receiving crank turn. The sending crank varies the\r\nresistance, the resistance varies the current, the current varies the\r\nstrength of the receiving magnet, and the magnet varies the position of\r\nthe receiving crank. Properly adjusted, then, the motion of the crank at\r\nthe one end is communicated through that long chain of causes and\r\neffects, until at last it is repeated _exactly_ by the movement of the\r\ncrank at the other end.\r\n\r\nThe same thing occurs simultaneously over each of the two wires, crank\r\n_a_ at the sending end communicating over wire _a_ to crank _a_ at the\r\nother end, while crank _b_ communicates its motion over wire _b_ to the\r\nother crank _b_. Each sending crank is closely imitated in its every\r\naction by the corresponding one at the distant station.\r\n\r\nThe two receiving cranks are connected by light rods to the receiving\r\npen in precisely the same way that the sending pen is connected.\r\nConsequently, not only are the separate movements of the two cranks\r\nrepeated at the remote station but the complex movements of the sending\r\npen, which gave rise to the actions of the cranks, are also conveyed to,\r\nand repeated by, the recording pen. The movements of the first pen are\r\nresolved into rotating motions by the two cranks, these are transferred\r\nto the other cranks, and their movements are in turn converted back into\r\nthe written curves.\r\n\r\nThus as the pen in the artist's hand draws his sketch, so does the\r\nautomatic hand at the other place, it may be at a great distance, repeat\r\nfaithfully his work, and the sketch grows line by line simultaneously at\r\nboth ends.\r\n\r\nThere is not space here to detail how, by another current superposed\r\nupon those referred to already, the receiving-pen is made to dip itself\r\nperiodically into the inkwell at the will of the sender. By a cunning\r\nuse of alternating current this is done without in any way interfering\r\nwith the action of the cranks as described above.\r\n\r\nBut of course there is a severe limitation to the usefulness of this\r\nmachine, inasmuch as the drawing has to be made at the time of\r\ntransmission, and it can only be \"put on the wire\" by the hand of the\r\nartist himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nA WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF SCIENCE AND SKILL\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter reference was made to the fact that for the\r\nsuccessful sending of pictures \"by wire\" one thing was necessary above\r\nall others. That one thing consists in making two machines, perhaps\r\nhundreds of miles apart, start working together, stop together and, when\r\nworking, turn at exactly the same speed. Let the reader just picture the\r\nproblem to himself, and ask himself how such an arrangement can be\r\npossible. Let him think of a town two hundred miles away and then\r\nmeditate on the possibility of making a machine working in his own room\r\nand another in that distant town maintain perfect unanimity in their\r\nmovements. The result of such reflection will probably be the assertion\r\nthat such a thing is beyond the bounds of possibility. Then he will find\r\nthe following description of how it is done extremely interesting.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it must be understood that each machine is driven by\r\nan electric motor. The motors are designed to run at 3000 revolutions\r\nper minute, and they drive the cylinders of the machines through gearing\r\nso arranged that the latter turn at 50 revolutions per minute.\r\n\r\nNow of all machines perhaps the most docile and easily managed is the\r\ndirect-current electric motor. Each such machine is made with a view to\r\nits working at a certain speed, but that can be varied within certain\r\nlimits, by simply varying the force of the current which drives it. And\r\nthat force can be very easily varied by the use of an instrument called\r\na \"rheostat\" or variable resistance. We are all familiar with the way in\r\nwhich the engine-driver regulates the speed of a locomotive, by means of\r\na valve in the steam-pipe. The opening and closing, more or less, of\r\nthe valve enables the speed to be changed at will and adjusted to a\r\nnicety. The rheostat is to the electric current what the valve is to the\r\nsteam; it can be opened and closed, more or less, as necessary. By it\r\nthe current driving the motor can be made stronger or weaker, and as\r\nthat change is made so does the speed of the motor change accordingly.\r\nThus we see that there is at hand the means of setting a motor to work\r\nat any desired speed.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty, however, is to tell when the desired speed has been\r\nattained. One can count the revolutions of a machine at two or three\r\nrevolutions per minute with a certain amount of accuracy, but fifty\r\nrevolutions per minute are more than one could count correctly. Still\r\nless could we count the 3000 revolutions every minute of the motors.\r\nThus, even if we had the two motors side by side, we should have extreme\r\ndifficulty in making them work at the same speed exactly. One might be\r\ndoing 3000 while the other did 2990 or 3010 and we should be none the\r\nwiser. And when we separate the two by a distance of many miles, the\r\ntask of synchronising them is even worse.\r\n\r\nBut fortunately there is a simple contrivance by which we can tell very\r\naccurately the speed of a motor. The reader has already been\r\nfamiliarised, in previous chapters, with the difference between direct\r\nor continuous electric currents and alternating ones. It is the\r\ncontinuous sort which is used to drive these motors, but a slight\r\naddition to the machine will make it so that while direct current is put\r\nin, to drive it, alternating current can be drawn out of it. Two little\r\ninsulated metal rings are fitted on to the spindle of the machine, and\r\nthese are connected in certain ways to the wires of the motor; then\r\nagainst these rings, as they turn, there rub two little metal arms,\r\ncalled, because of their sweeping action, brushes; and from these\r\nbrushes we can draw the alternating current.\r\n\r\nFor our present purpose the importance of this lies in the fact that the\r\nrate at which that current will alternate depends upon the speed of the\r\nmotor. As the motor increases or decreases in speed, so will the rate of\r\nalternation increase or decrease. So that if we can measure the rate at\r\nwhich the current drawn from the motor is alternating, we shall know\r\nfrom that the rate at which the machine is working.\r\n\r\nThis we can do by the aid of a \"frequency meter.\" The working of this is\r\nbased upon the acting of a tuning-fork. Everyone knows that a given\r\ntuning-fork always gives out the same note. The note depends upon the\r\nrate at which the fork vibrates, and the reason that one fork always\r\ngives the same note is because it always vibrates at the same rate. That\r\nrate, in turn, depends upon its length. If one were to file a little off\r\nthe end of a tuning-fork, its note would be raised, because its rate of\r\nvibration would become faster. Similarly, lengthening the fork would\r\nresult in a lower note being given. Thus, a tuning-fork, or any bar of\r\nsteel held by one end, and free to vibrate at the other, gives us a\r\nstandard of speed which is very reliable. And it so happens that we can\r\neasily use a set of such forks to test the rate of alternation of an\r\nalternating current.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, alternating current is no use for energising a\r\nmagnet. The chief reason for that is that the current tends to get\r\nchoked up, as it were, in the coil. Alternating current traverses a coil\r\nvery reluctantly indeed. It is, however, possible to make an electric\r\nmagnet of special design which will work sufficiently well with\r\nalternating current to answer our present purpose. And it will be clear\r\nthat just as the alternating current itself consists of a series of\r\nshort currents, so the force of the magnet will be intermittent; it will\r\ngive not a steady pull, as is usually the case with magnets, but a\r\nsuccession of little tugs. There will, in fact, be one tug for every\r\nalternation of the current.\r\n\r\nA simple form of motor fitted up as just described, and rotating at 3000\r\nrevolutions per minute, would give out 100 alternations per second. If,\r\nthen, such current were employed to energise a magnet, that magnet would\r\ngive 100 tugs per second.\r\n\r\nSo a small steel bar of the right length to give 100 vibrations per\r\nsecond can be fixed with its free end nearly touching such a magnet, and\r\nwhen the current is turned on it will very soon be vibrating vigorously.\r\nFor the tugs of the magnet will agree with the natural rate of vibration\r\nof the bar. And just as the two pendulums described in Chapter XII.\r\nresponded readily to each other, so the bar responds readily to the\r\npulls of the magnet. But increase or decrease the rate of alternation\r\never so slightly, and that sympathy between magnet and bar is destroyed.\r\nThe bar will not then respond. It will only answer when the pulls of the\r\nmagnet and the natural rate of vibration of the bar exactly correspond.\r\n\r\nSo it is usual to place five or six such bars with their ends near the\r\none magnet. The lengths of the bars vary slightly, so that the rates of\r\nvibration are, say, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102 respectively.\r\n\r\nLet us, in imagination, adjust the speed of a supposititious motor until\r\nwe get that which corresponds to 100 alternations.\r\n\r\nWe switch on the current and at first, possibly, we get no response from\r\nany of the vibrating bars. Just a touch to the handle of the rheostat\r\nand we notice that bar 102 shows signs of life. We see then that our\r\nfirst speed was much too fast, and that reducing it has brought it down\r\nto 102, which is still a little too fast. Just a little more movement of\r\nthe handle, and 102 begins to relapse into quiet, while 101 shows\r\nanimation. A little more movement and 101 gives place to 100, and then\r\nwe know that our motor is working at the desired speed. If our motor had\r\nbeen too slow to commence with, it would have been 98 which first got\r\ninto action, but the method of adjustment would have been precisely the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nAnd thus we see the whole scheme. We regulate the speed by the rheostat,\r\nand meanwhile that tell-tale stream of alternating current comes flowing\r\nout of the motor to indicate to us what the speed is, while the\r\n\"frequency meter,\" with its various vibrating bars, interprets to us\r\nthe message which the alternating current brings to us. So by watching\r\nthe meter we know when we have got the speed that we desire.\r\n\r\nBut even that is only half the battle. We have seen how to make a\r\nmachine turn at any desired speed, and so we can adjust any two, so that\r\nthey revolve at the same speed, but we have not seen how to start and\r\nstop the two machines at the same time.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it must be understood that in the case of the receiving\r\nmachine there is a friction clutch, as it is termed, between the motor\r\nand the cylinder which it is driving. That means that while, under\r\nordinary circumstances, the motor drives the cylinder round, we can, if\r\nwe like, hold the latter still without stopping the motor. When we do\r\nso, the connection between the two simply slips.\r\n\r\nSo if we fit a catch on the cylinder which is capable of holding it from\r\nrotating, we can still start the motor, and the latter will work. Then,\r\nthe moment the catch is released the cylinder will begin to turn too.\r\nThe commonest form of \"friction drive\" is the flat leather belt upon two\r\npulleys, which everyone has seen at some time or other in a factory. And\r\nit will be quite easy to conceive how, if one of the driven machines\r\nwere to stick, the belt might simply slip upon one of the pulleys, yet,\r\nas soon as the machine became free again, it would rotate just as it did\r\nbefore. It is just the same with what we are considering. The motor\r\nworks continuously at its proper speed, but the cylinder can be stopped\r\nwhen desired by the catch.\r\n\r\nCombined with the catch is an electro-magnet, and through its coils\r\nthere flows the current of electricity which is engaged in printing the\r\npicture on the cylinder. If a magnet be arranged to attract another\r\nmagnet, it will do so only when the energising current flows one way.\r\nWhen it flows the other way, it does not attract. Therefore it is easy\r\nto arrange matters so that the printing current, though passing through\r\nthe coil of the magnet, shall not pull open the catch. But if that\r\ncurrent be _reversed_ in direction for a moment the magnet gives a pull,\r\nopen flies the catch, and away goes the cylinder upon its revolution.\r\n\r\nThus, we see, all that is necessary to start the receiving cylinder is\r\nto reverse the current for a moment.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us turn our attention to the sending machine. Upon its\r\ncylinder there is an arrangement which automatically reverses the\r\ncurrent flowing to the main wire once in every revolution. Normally the\r\ncurrent flows to the wire as described in the last chapter, carrying by\r\nmeans of its variations the details of the picture for reproduction by\r\nthe receiving machine at the other end. But for an instant once in every\r\nrevolution that current is interrupted and a current sent in the\r\nopposite direction instead. This the sending machine does of itself,\r\nquite automatically.\r\n\r\nAnd now the reader knows of all the apparatus; it remains only to see\r\nhow the different parts work in combination.\r\n\r\nStanding by the sending machine we first of all turn on the current,\r\nwhich goes coursing along the wire to the distant station. Then we set\r\nthe motor to work and the cylinder begins to rotate. Before it has\r\ncompleted a single revolution the \"reverser\" is operated, and just for a\r\nmoment the reverse current goes to the wire. On arrival at the other end\r\nthat lifts the catch and the receiving cylinder starts. That first\r\npartial revolution of the sending cylinder counts for nothing. Real\r\nbusiness begins when the reverser first acts, and that is the moment\r\nwhen the receiving cylinder also begins to move. Similarly, when the\r\nsending cylinder stops it sends no more reversed currents, and so the\r\nreceiving cylinder is caught by the catch and not released.\r\n\r\nSo starting and stopping are quite automatic. The same arrangement\r\nenables a continual readjustment of the relative speed of the two\r\ncylinders to take place. With all the best devices, the tuning-forks and\r\nthe rest, it is still impossible to attain perfect unanimity, but the\r\nvariation in a single revolution cannot be enough to matter; it is only\r\nwhen the error in one revolution goes on multiplying itself that serious\r\ndifference might arise, and that is prevented in the following\r\nbeautifully simple way.\r\n\r\nThe motor which drives the receiving drum is so regulated that it\r\ntravels _slightly faster_ than does the other. Thus the receiving\r\ncylinder completes every revolution slightly in advance of the other,\r\nand consequently it is stopped and held by the catch every time. The\r\ncatch retains it, of course, until the reverse current arrives and\r\nreleases it. Thus not only does the sending cylinder start the other\r\nwhen the operations first commence, but it does so every revolution.\r\nEvery revolution, therefore, the two cylinders start together.\r\n\r\nSo the two cylinders are set, according to the frequency meter, at as\r\nnearly as possible exactly the correct speeds, and the action of the\r\nreverser, the reverse current and the catch, ensures quite automatically\r\nthat at the commencement of every revolution there shall be perfect\r\nagreement between the two. No accumulation of errors can possibly occur,\r\nand the problem, though apparently so difficult, if not insuperable, at\r\nfirst sight, is surmounted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC TESTING AND MEASURING\r\n\r\n\r\nScience, whether it be of the pure variety, that which is pursued for\r\nits own sake--for the mere greed for knowledge--or applied science, the\r\npurpose of which is to assist manufacture, is based entirely upon\r\naccurate testing and measuring. It is only by discovering and\r\ninvestigating small differences in size, weight or strength that some of\r\nthe most important facts can be brought to light. There are some\r\nproblems, too, that defy theory, since they are too complicated; they\r\ninvolve too many theories all at once, and such can only be solved by\r\naccurate tests. And all these necessitate the use of very ingenious and\r\noften costly devices.\r\n\r\nElectrical measuring instruments were of sufficient importance and\r\ninterest to warrant a chapter of their own, but there are many others of\r\ngreat value, and not without interest to the general reader.\r\n\r\nFor example, some years ago there was a collision in the Solent, just\r\noff Cowes, between the cruiser _Hawke_ and the giant liner _Olympic_.\r\nThe cause of this was a subject of dispute and of litigation; the\r\ntheorists theorised; some reached the conclusion that the _Hawke_ was to\r\nblame, and others the _Olympic_; and where doctors disagree who shall\r\ndecide? It was wisely decreed that tests should be made to settle the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe main point was this. The officers of the _Hawke_, by far the smaller\r\nvessel, averred that they were drawn out of their course by suction\r\ncaused by the movement of so large a ship as the _Olympic_ in the\r\ncomparatively narrow and shallow waters of the Solent; in other words,\r\nthat the _Olympic_ in moving through the water caused a swirling,\r\neddying motion in the water, tending to draw a lighter vessel towards\r\nitself. And that is just one of those problems with which theory is\r\nunable to deal. So it was transferred to the National Physical\r\nLaboratory at Teddington, near London, for investigation by experiment.\r\n\r\nAt this institution, which is a semi-national one, there is a tank\r\nconstructed for purposes such as this. The word tank leads us to\r\nunderestimate its size somewhat, for it is 494 feet long and 30 feet\r\nwide. It is solidly constructed of concrete, with a miniature set of\r\ndocks at one end, and a sloping beach at the other.\r\n\r\nOn either side are rails upon which run trollys which support the ends\r\nof a bridge which spans the whole. This bridge can be propelled along,\r\nby means of electric motors operating the wheels of the trollys, from\r\none end of the tank to the other, at any desired speed, within, of\r\ncourse, reasonable limits, and from it may be towed any model which it\r\nis desired to test.\r\n\r\nThe models used are usually made of wax, by means of a machine specially\r\ndesigned for the purpose. It should be explained that the plans of a\r\nship consist of a series of curves, each of which represents the contour\r\nof the vessel at one particular height. For example, if you can imagine\r\na ship cut horizontally into slices of uniform thickness, then each\r\nslice could be shown on the drawing (the \"shear plan,\" as it is termed)\r\nby a curved line. Near the keel the lines would, of course, be almost\r\nstraight, but they would bulge more and more as they occur higher up.\r\nAnd what this machine is required to do is to make, quickly and\r\neconomically, a wax model which shall be an exact reproduction, on a\r\nsmall scale, of the vessel under discussion. It may be--it most often\r\nis--a ship as yet unbuilt, the behaviour of which it is desired to test.\r\nOr it may be an existing vessel, as it was in the case mentioned just\r\nnow. However that may be, the model is made from the drawings.\r\n\r\nA block of wax rests upon a table, while the drawing is spread upon a\r\nboard near by. A pointer is moved by hand along one of the lines, and\r\nits movement is repeated by a rapidly revolving cutter which cuts away\r\nthe wax to a similar curve. By suitable adjustments the cutter can be\r\nmade to magnify or reduce the size, so as to produce any desired scale.\r\nThus every line is gone over and a similar curve cut in the wax at the\r\ncorrect height. Of course this only produces a lump of wax shaped _in\r\nsteps_, as it were, but it is then quite easy to trim it down by hand,\r\nso as to produce a smooth model of the ship, perfectly accurate in its\r\nshape, and a copy on a small scale of the vessel portrayed on the\r\ndrawing.\r\n\r\nIt can also be hollowed out, ballasted with weights inside, and so made\r\nto sink to any desired level, thereby representing the vessel when fully\r\nloaded, half loaded and so on. All sorts of unequal loading can be\r\nproduced if needed, indeed every condition of the real ship can be\r\nimitated in the model.\r\n\r\nIt can then be towed to and fro in the tank by the travelling carriage\r\ndescribed above. The speed of towing can be varied by changing the speed\r\nof the motors which drive it. The force needed to pull the model through\r\nthe water is measured by means of a dynamometer which registers the pull\r\non the towing apparatus.\r\n\r\nA matter very often needing investigation is the shape and size of the\r\nwave thrown up by the bow of the vessel, and of that left behind her,\r\nknown as the \"bow wave\" and the \"stern wave\" respectively. These waves\r\nrepresent wasted energy, for they are no use and are produced actually\r\nby the power of the engines of the ship as they drive her along. The\r\nideal ship would cause no waves, but since that is a degree of\r\nperfection impossible even to hope for, the shipbuilder has to content\r\nhimself by so designing his ships that these waves shall be as small as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe waves are recorded photographically, in some cases by the\r\nkinematograph.\r\n\r\nSome of the large shipbuilders have their own tanks, and so have the\r\nnaval authorities of the great naval Powers. The one at Teddington was\r\nestablished through the munificence of a famous British shipbuilder, Mr\r\nYarrow, who not only defrayed the cost of construction, but gave an\r\nendowment to assist in its upkeep. It is intended to serve the needs of\r\nthe smaller builders who have not tanks of their own, and also for the\r\ninvestigation of matters of general interest to shipbuilders, and for\r\nsuch tests as that relating to the _Hawke_ and _Olympic_. In this\r\nlast-named case, of course, two models were made, one to represent each\r\nship, and they were towed along in such a way as to imitate very closely\r\nthe movements of the ships at the time when they collided. It was as the\r\nresult of these tests that the _Olympic_ was ordered to pay damages to\r\nthe Admiralty, it being held that she was the cause of the accident.\r\n\r\nA very interesting investigation of this kind was recently carried out\r\nin the tank at the United States Navy Yard. The port of New York\r\nconsists very largely of jetties projecting out from the banks of the\r\nriver. With the growth of the Atlantic liner the old jetties had become\r\ntoo short, and questions arose as to the elongation of them. If it were\r\ndone, how would it effect the current in the river, and the handling of\r\nshipping generally? If, on the other hand, it were not done, what would\r\nbe the effect of the ships lying with their ends projecting out into the\r\nstream unprotected by a jetty.\r\n\r\nTo determine these points the experimental tank was converted into a\r\nmodel of the New York Harbour, or at all events of that part in\r\nconnection with which these questions arose.\r\n\r\nA false floor was put in, so as to make the depth exactly right in\r\nproportion to the width. Little model jetties were arranged to represent\r\nexactly the real ones, while against them were moored model vessels, so\r\nthat the effect upon them could be observed as the model of the large\r\nvessel was towed past.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, special appliances were arranged for finding out\r\nwhat the disturbance might be which the movement of a giant liner\r\nproduces under the surface as well as above it. For this purpose buoyant\r\nballs were employed, moored at various distances below the surface, from\r\nwhich thin rods projected upwards, the movement of which rendered\r\nvisible the movements of the submerged balls and therefore the effects\r\nof the under-water currents.\r\n\r\nAll these things had to be observed at one and the same time--the moving\r\nmodel itself, the models alongside the jetties, the commotion on the\r\nsurface, the swayings to and fro of the rods attached to the submerged\r\nfloats--all, or most of which, at all events, it was impossible to make\r\nself-recording. Yet, seeing that it was of the utmost importance that\r\nthe relations between all these things should be observed, and recorded\r\nfrom time to time as the model was towed along, it is evident that\r\nsomething must be done, and a cunning use of the kinematograph solved\r\nthe problem quite easily. At various points commanding a good view of\r\nthe model harbour and its shipping these machines were placed, and so\r\nseveral series of photographs were obtained, by the study of which all\r\nthe different movements could be seen and compared. A large dial too was\r\nrigged up upon the travelling carriage by which the model was towed, a\r\nfinger on which denoted the distance which the carriage had travelled at\r\nany moment. This large dial came into each photograph, of course, and so\r\neach picture bore upon itself a clear record of that particular moment\r\nin the voyage of the model to which it referred.\r\n\r\nThus we see an instance of how the very latest and most up-to-date\r\nmethods of amusement are sometimes applied to serve very practical\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nAkin to the experiments upon ships are aerial experiments to determine\r\nmatters connected with the navigation of the air. At Barrow-in-Furness\r\nthe great firm of Vickers, shipbuilders and armament manufacturers, and\r\nlatterly builders of aerial craft for the British Admiralty, have\r\nerected a machine for testing the efficiency of aerial propellers and\r\nother things of a kindred nature. Upon the top of a tall tower there is\r\npivoted a long arm of light iron framework. To the end of this a\r\npropeller can be fixed, so that as the arm revolves there is produced\r\nalmost exactly the same conditions as those which prevail when a\r\npropeller drives an aeroplane or steerable balloon.\r\n\r\nBy means of suitable mechanism the propeller can be turned at any\r\ndesired speed, with the result that it drives the arm round and round\r\nupon its pivot on the top of the tower. The force which the propeller\r\nthus exerts can easily be measured, and so can be determined such\r\nquestions as the most efficient speed for each type of propeller, the\r\npower which any particular one can develop, the best form for each\r\nparticular need, and so on.\r\n\r\nMaterials, too, require the most careful testing, in order that they may\r\nbe put to the best possible use in modern machinery and structures. For\r\nexample, anyone can measure the strength of a spring, but what do we\r\nknow as to its lasting power? Springs often have to form part of a\r\nmachine in which they are stretched and compressed millions of times,\r\nand the question arises as to what is the best shape and material for\r\nthe purpose. It may be that the spring which works best a few times will\r\nbe the first to become \"weary,\" for with repeated strain such things as\r\nsteel get tired, just as the human frame does. Now that is a matter\r\nwhich will yield to no calculation, the only way to determine it is\r\nactual test. So a mechanism has to be employed which will extend and\r\ncompress the spring over and over again, just as it will be in actual\r\nuse, with a counter of the nature of a cyclometer to count how many\r\ntimes it has been subjected to this distortion. Then the apparatus is\r\nset going and left to itself for hours, or even for days, during which\r\ntime it may work the spring millions of times. This may go on until it\r\nbreaks, or else it may be done a prearranged number of times, and then\r\nthe spring taken out and tested by other means to see how its strength\r\nhas been affected.\r\n\r\nMetal bars are often subjected to sudden blows, light in themselves but\r\noft repeated. The point to be determined then is how many times the blow\r\nmay fall before permanent injury is done to the bar. To investigate such\r\nmatters we have the \"repeated-impact\" machine. The bar is held in a\r\nsuitable holder, under a hammer which gives it a blow, the force of\r\nwhich can be easily regulated, at regular intervals, the number of blows\r\nbeing counted by a suitable recording mechanism. Ultimately the bar\r\nbreaks, under a blow the like of which it can endure singly without any\r\napparent strain at all. The machine, by the way, can be caused to turn\r\nthe bar round to some degree after each blow, so that it is struck from\r\nall directions in succession.\r\n\r\nThe microscope, too, has established its place in the testing\r\nlaboratory. It is a very valuable adjunct to chemical and mechanical\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for example, that a bar of steel is being investigated; it can\r\nbe put into a machine and pulled until it breaks in two. The machine\r\nregisters the amount of the pull which was applied. Or a small piece can\r\nbe put under a press and compressed to any desired degree. It can also\r\nbe tested by impact or even pulled apart by a sudden blow, as described\r\nin _Mechanical Inventions of To-day_. The bar can be supported by its\r\nends and loaded or pulled down in the centre, so that its power of\r\nresisting bending can be determined. It can be judged, too, from its\r\nchemical composition. Steel, in particular, depends for its properties\r\nvery largely upon its chemical composition. The difference between\r\ncast-iron, wrought-iron and steel, also the differences between the\r\ninnumerable varieties of steel, are due almost entirely to the admixture\r\nof a certain percentage of carbon with the metal. This can be\r\nascertained by chemical analysis. This form of inquiry has the advantage\r\nover the more purely mechanical methods in that the latter, for the most\r\npart, have to be applied to the bar as a whole, whereas the quality may\r\nvary in different parts, the surface in particular being liable to\r\ndiffer from the interior. In such cases, one analysis can be made of a\r\npiece cut from the surface and another of a piece from the centre.\r\n\r\nAnd it is here, too, that microscopical analysis comes in. For this\r\npurpose a piece is sawn off the bar, and the end ground perfectly\r\nsmooth. This is then washed in a suitable chemical, such as a mild acid,\r\nwhich acts differently upon the different materials of which the \"metal\"\r\nis built up, thereby rendering them visible one from another. A\r\nphotograph taken through a microscope then shows the structure of the\r\nmetal; how the different constituents are built together.\r\n\r\nThis is known as metallographic testing, and its advantage as compared\r\nwith chemical analysis is that the latter shows, as we might say, what\r\nare the bricks of which the thing is built, while the former shows how\r\nthe bricks are arranged. Indeed it is hardly correct to speak of the\r\nadvantage or superiority of one over the other, since each is the\r\ncomplement of the other, supplying the information which the other fails\r\nto give.\r\n\r\nAnd there are other mechanical tests which have not yet been mentioned.\r\nThere are machines which twist a bar so as to discover its power to\r\nresist torsion, there are others which apply a downward pressure on one\r\npart of the bar and an upward one on an adjacent part, so as to show its\r\ncapabilities in withstanding shearing strain.\r\n\r\nMoreover, many of these tests are nowadays, in a well-equipped\r\ntesting-house, carried out in conjunction with the use of heat. It\r\nstands to reason that a part of a machine which will have to work under\r\nconsiderable heat may have to be of different material from a part which\r\nworks under a normal temperature. In some cases the bar is surrounded by\r\na spiral wire through which electric current is passing, and by the\r\nregulation of this current any desired temperature can be set up in the\r\nbar. Or it may be placed in a bath of hot oil in such a way that the bar\r\nshall be raised to any temperature required, without interfering with\r\nthe machinery which exerts the tension or pressure, or whatever it be.\r\n\r\nYears ago such elaborate tests as these were never thought of. There are\r\ncertain well-known figures, to be found in all engineering text-books,\r\nwhich give what stresses different materials ought to be able to stand,\r\nand these were, and are still, to a large extent, relied upon, it being\r\ntaken for granted that the material used will be up to the average\r\nstandard. In large and important works, however, the testing has been\r\ndeveloped upon scientific lines, so that it is known from actual\r\nexperiment what each particular thing is capable of. This not only means\r\nsecurity but economy, for it is sometimes found that a substance is\r\nstronger than it is thought to be, and so things made of it can be\r\ndesigned to give the requisite strength lighter and cheaper than they\r\nwould have been otherwise.\r\n\r\nSome of the machines employed are of enormous strength, capable of\r\nexerting a pull or a compression of, it may be, 100 tons or more. They\r\nare often made, too, with self-recording appliances, whereby the course\r\nof the test is set down automatically upon a chart. For example, when a\r\nbar is being tested for tension, it is desirable to know not only the\r\nactual pull under which it came in two, but the behaviour of the test\r\npiece during the period before that. It begins to stretch as soon as the\r\ntension is applied, theoretically at all events, and if the metal were\r\nperfectly ductile it would stretch continuously as the load increases,\r\nuntil at last the breaking stress is reached. But in actual practice it\r\nprobably stretches somewhat by fits and starts, and a record of that\r\nfact will be of great value in estimating the strength of the material\r\nin actual work. For such, an automatically made record, which can be\r\nstudied at leisure, is of the utmost importance.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the finest instance of scientific methods in manufacture is\r\nto be found in the methods by which standard parts of machines are\r\nmeasured, so as to ensure that they shall be interchangeable.\r\n\r\nIt may surprise the casual reader to be told that an absolutely exact\r\nmeasurement is an impossibility. It is safe to say that out of a\r\nmillion similar articles--articles made with the intention that they\r\nshall be exactly alike--there are no two which are, in fact, absolutely\r\nsimilar. They may be made with the same machines and the same tools,\r\nhandled by the same man, but machines and tools wear or get out of\r\nadjustment, while man's liability to err is proverbial. Astronomers are\r\nthe greatest experts in the art of measurement, and they recognise the\r\npossibility, nay, the probability, of error so frankly as to make every\r\nmeasurement several times over; if it be an important one they make it,\r\nif possible, a great many times over, and then take the average of the\r\nresults. By this means they eliminate, to a certain extent at any rate,\r\nthe error which cannot be avoided. That process is to allow for errors\r\non the part of their instruments, for the most part. To deal with\r\npersonal errors another method is used as well, for it is known that\r\nsome observers have a natural tendency to err on one side more or less,\r\nwhile others tend to make mistakes in some degree on the other side.\r\nThis tendency to err is known as the \"personal equation\" of the\r\nobserver, and there are machines and tests by which the personal\r\nequation of each man can be determined, or perhaps it would be more\r\ncorrect to say estimated, so that in all observations made by him the\r\nproper allowance can be added or deducted.\r\n\r\nBut of course it would be extremely difficult to apply such methods in a\r\nworkshop. It would never do to have to measure everything several times\r\nover, hoping that the average would come out in such manner as to\r\nindicate that the thing being measured was the size required. Instead,\r\ntherefore, of wasting time seeking an accuracy which is known to be\r\nunattainable, the manufacturing engineer adopts a scientific system of\r\nmeasurement wherein a certain amount of inaccuracy is determined upon as\r\npermissible, and then simple appliances are used to see that it does, in\r\nfact, fall within those limits. For instance, a round bar is to be made,\r\nsay, an inch in diameter. Now we know from what has just been said that,\r\nwhen made, we have no means of telling whether the bar is really and\r\ntruly an inch in diameter or not. We consider, then, what it is for, and\r\ndecide, say, that it will be near enough so long as we are sure that it\r\nis not larger than one inch plus one thousandth, nor less than one inch\r\nminus one thousandth. So long as it does not exceed or fall short of its\r\nreputed size by more than one thousandth of an inch, then we know that\r\nit will answer its purpose.\r\n\r\nNow, having come to that decision, we can build up a system upon which\r\nany intelligent workman can proceed, with the result that all the inch\r\nbars which he makes will be the same size within the limits of 1/1000\r\nover or under, so that the greatest possible difference between any two\r\nwill be 1/500.\r\n\r\nThis system involves the use of two gauges for every size. The man\r\nemployed upon making one-inch bars has a plate with a hole in it\r\n1-1/1000 inches in diameter and another hole 999/1000 of an inch in\r\ndiameter. One of these is the \"go in\" gauge; the other is the \"not go\r\nin.\" So that all he has to do, in order to be quite sure that his work\r\nis right, is to see that it can be poked through one of these holes, but\r\nnot through the other. No trouble at all, it will be observed, adjusting\r\nfine measuring appliances, simply a plate with two holes in it, and the\r\nworkman can be sure that he is turning out articles every one of which\r\nis practically correct, with no variation beyond a slight inequality too\r\nsmall to matter.\r\n\r\nAnd probably at some other part of the factory there is a man making\r\narticles each of which has a hole in it, into which this bar must fit.\r\nHow does he manage? He is provided with a gauge somewhat the shape of a\r\ndumb-bell, one end of which is slightly larger than the other. One is\r\nthe \"go in\" end, the other the \"not go in\" end. If the hole which he\r\nmakes will permit the former to enter, but will refuse admittance to the\r\nlatter, then he knows that that hole is sufficiently near its reputed\r\nsize to answer its purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of The Mining Engineering Co., Sheffield_\r\n\r\n                        A MINERS' RESCUE TEAM\r\n\r\nThese men are equipped with breathing apparatus which enables them to\r\npass safely through the deadly fumes after an explosion, to rescue their\r\n                        unfortunate comrades]\r\n\r\nIn the instances mentioned, a thousandth of an inch either way has been\r\nmentioned as the limit of inaccuracy, or the \"tolerance,\" as it is\r\nsometimes termed, but often the limits are much narrower than that. The\r\ngauges themselves are a case in point, for they must be true within,\r\nsay, a ten-thousandth, or even less. And they too are checked by master\r\ngauges of a finer degree of accuracy still, being made by the most\r\nlaborious methods, and checked over and over again, so as to reach the\r\nutmost limits in the way of correctness.\r\n\r\nSo this methodical \"scientific\" system of \"limit gauges\" is based upon\r\nthe principle of having one gauge limiting the error one way and another\r\ndefining it in the other. Anything simpler or more effective it would be\r\nimpossible to conceive. It is due very largely to this system that many\r\nmanufactured articles are now so much cheaper than they used to be. For\r\nit enables each individual part to be made wholesale on a large scale,\r\nby machines specially adapted to the work, operated by men specially\r\ntrained to work them, with the practical certainty that these parts when\r\nassembled together will fit each other.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there is another very interesting instrument which was\r\nfirst made for a purely utilitarian use--namely, the investigation of\r\nthe methods of making coloured glass--but which has since been applied\r\nto some interesting problems in pure science. It is called the\r\n\"ultra-microscope.\"\r\n\r\nIt must first be pointed out that there is a limit to the power of the\r\nordinary microscope, beyond which the skill of the optician cannot go.\r\nHe is baffled at that point not because of any lack of ability on his\r\nown part, but because of the nature of light itself. An opaque object,\r\nunless it be self-luminous, which few things are, can only be seen by\r\nreflected light. Generally speaking, we see things because they reflect\r\nin some degree the light which falls upon them. But light consists of\r\nwaves, and when we reach an object so minute that its diameter is about\r\nhalf the wave-length of light, then we cannot see it because it is\r\nunable to reflect the light on account of its smallness. We can see\r\nthis any day by the seaside, or by a river or large pond. There it is\r\nevident that the waves and ripples are reflected by such things as large\r\nstones, wood posts or anything of any size which come in their way; but\r\nwhen a wave encounters an object much smaller than itself it simply\r\nswallows it up, as it were, flows all over it or around it, without\r\nbeing in any way reflected by it. And it is just the same with the waves\r\nof light; they are unaffected by obstacles below a certain size, and so\r\nare not reflected by them. For this reason things smaller than about a\r\nseven-thousandth of a millimetre cannot possibly be seen by a microscope\r\nin the ordinary way.\r\n\r\nBut if an object can be made self-luminous, then it can be seen,\r\nwhatever its size, if the magnifying power of the microscope be great\r\nenough. So this ultra-microscope, as it is called, is really an ordinary\r\nmicroscope of the highest power possible, with an added apparatus for\r\nmaking the tiny particles which are being sought for self-luminous. This\r\nis done by directing upon them a pencil of light of exceeding intensity.\r\nGenerated by powerful arc lamps, the light is concentrated by a system\r\nof lenses until it is of an almost incredible brightness, after which it\r\nfalls upon the object.\r\n\r\nNow at first sight this seems to be no different from the usual\r\nprocedure with a microscope, and there appears to be no reason why it\r\nshould be more successful, but the explanation is this: light is a form\r\nof energy, and the waves of this very intense beam, falling upon the\r\nobject, throw it into a state of violent agitation, by virtue of which\r\nit shines, not with reflected light, but with light of its own. It is\r\nnot that the waves are reflected, but that they so shake up the particle\r\nthat it gives off light waves itself. And thus it comes within the range\r\nof human vision.\r\n\r\nIn this way, not only have the very small particles of colouring matter\r\nin glass been seen individually, but it is thought that the actual\r\nmolecules of matter have been seen, or if not the molecules\r\nindividually, little groups of molecules, dancing and capering about,\r\njust as scientific people for years have believed them to be doing,\r\nalthough they could not see them. So here we have an instance in which\r\nmanufacture has aided science--an inversion of the usual order of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCOLOUR PHOTOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotography has introduced many of the general public to a branch of\r\npractical science which otherwise they would never have cared much\r\nabout. The action of light upon certain chemicals, the subsequent action\r\nupon the same of other chemicals, such as developers, toning solutions\r\nand so on, form a very well-known region of the domain of science. And\r\nthis is, too, a branch of chemistry in which the practical inventor has\r\nbeen very busy. The efforts, therefore, which have been made to invent\r\nways of producing photographic pictures which shall give to the objects\r\ntheir natural colours, will probably be of special interest in a book\r\nlike this.\r\n\r\nOf these there are two very well-known systems, and to them we will\r\nmainly confine our attention.\r\n\r\nIt should first be pointed out, however, that what we are discussing is\r\nquite different from the simple \"orthochromatic\" plates which are used\r\nby many photographers. These latter are coated somewhat differently from\r\nother plates, with a view to their giving a more realistic picture, but\r\nthe result is still in one colour. They are, in fact, a little more\r\nsensitive to differences in colour than ordinary plates, so that colours\r\nwhich appear, when the latter are used, very much the same, appear, when\r\northochromatic plates are employed, a little different. But the\r\ndifference in colour in the object photographed is only, even then,\r\nrepresented by a difference in shade in the picture. The object is, it\r\nmay be, in many colours, in all the colours, very likely, but the\r\npicture is only in one.\r\n\r\nAnd the step from that to a coloured picture is a very long one. True,\r\nthe solution of the problem is very simple in principle, yet the\r\npractical difficulties are so great that even now they have not been\r\nentirely overcome.\r\n\r\nLet us first of all examine the principle. Sunlight, by which\r\nphotographs are usually taken, appears to the eye white and colourless.\r\nIt is not really so, however, as can be proved by analysing it with the\r\nspectroscope. In this instrument a flat beam of light, having passed\r\nthrough a narrow slit, falls upon a prism of glass, from which it\r\nemerges as a broad band, known as the \"spectrum.\" This band can be seen\r\nupon a screen, or can be examined through a telescope. So far from being\r\nwhite and colourless, it consists of the most lovely colours. At one end\r\nof the spectrum is a beautiful red, which, as the eye travels along,\r\nimperceptibly merges into orange, which in turn merges into yellow,\r\nafter which we find green, blue, indigo and violet, in the order named.\r\nThese seven are known as the \"primary colours,\" but it is quite a\r\nmistake to suppose that there are seven clearly defined and distinct\r\ncolours. The colours so change, one into another, that their number is\r\nreally infinite. The seven names indicate seven points in the spectrum,\r\nwhereat the colours are sufficiently distinct from others to warrant a\r\nseparate name being given to them. We call the starting colour red, for\r\nexample, and as we pass our eyes along we perceive a constant change,\r\nand when that change has become sufficiently pronounced to justify our\r\ndoing so, we call the new colour \"orange.\" Continuing, we find the\r\norange changing into something else, and when it has gone far enough, we\r\nbring in a third name, yellow, and so on to the violet. Thus we see the\r\ndivision into seven colours is arbitrary, and only for our own\r\nconvenience, since the whole number of colours is innumerable.\r\n\r\nPassing through a prism is not, however, the only means by which white\r\nlight can be split up. When the sun shines upon a blue flower, for\r\ninstance, the blue petals perform a partial separation; they reflect the\r\nblue part of the sunlight, and absorb all the rest. A red flower\r\nlikewise reflects the red part of the sunlight and absorbs the rest. It\r\nis because things can thus discriminate, reflecting some kinds of light\r\nand absorbing the remainder, that we perceive things in different\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, that when we look upon a landscape, or a field of\r\nflowers, we receive into our eyes an enormous variety of coloured\r\nlights. The white sunlight furnishes each thing we see with a flood of\r\nwhite light, and each thing according to its nature, reflects more or\r\nless. A white flower reflects the whole, a pure black object reflects\r\nnone, but the great majority of things reflect some part or other of\r\nthat infinite variety of which white light really consists.\r\n\r\nSo a view at all varied sends to our eyes a variety of colours, almost\r\nas manifold as the colours of the spectrum, which, as has been said, are\r\ninfinite. And the task of reproducing them, or even of producing a\r\nsimilar general effect, upon a piece of paper seems at first sight\r\nbeyond the bounds of possibility.\r\n\r\nBut fortunately there is a way by which we can produce, approximately at\r\nall events, the intermediate colours by mixtures of the others. The\r\nsecond colour of the spectrum, for example, orange, can be obtained by\r\nmixing its neighbours on either hand--namely, red and yellow. We can,\r\nindeed, imitate very closely the imperceptible change from red to yellow\r\nthrough orange, by skilful mixture of red and yellow pigments. First\r\nthere is the pure red, then just a suggestion of yellow is added; more\r\nand more yellow brings us to orange; after which by gradually\r\ndiminishing the amount of red we reach the pure yellow. Next, by\r\nintroducing blue pigment, we can gradually change the yellow into green,\r\nand further manipulation of the same two colours will lead us on to pure\r\nblue. Indeed by mixtures of red, yellow and blue we can obtain almost\r\nall the perceptible varieties of colour.\r\n\r\nAnd it must be remembered that when, by mixing blue and yellow pigments,\r\nwe get the effect of green, that is only the result of an optical\r\nillusion. The particles of which the yellow pigment is made remain\r\nyellow, and the particles of blue remain blue. The one sort reflect\r\nyellow light to our eyes, the other sort reflect blue light, and owing\r\nto what in one sense may be called a defect in our vision, these two\r\nmingling together look as if the whole were green. In the spectrum we\r\nsee real green light; from green paint made by mixing yellow and blue,\r\nwe only see an imitation or artificial green. If the particles were\r\nlarge enough, we should see the yellow and the blue ones quite separate,\r\nbut since they are too small for us to see at all, except in the mass,\r\nour eyes blend the whole together into the intermediate colour.\r\n\r\nThus we see that, although the variety of colours is infinite, we can\r\nfor practical purposes reproduce as much difference as our eyes can\r\nperceive by the judicious blending of three--namely, red, yellow and\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nAnd there is a further fortunate fact--we can filter light. The red\r\nglass with which the photographer covers his dark-room lamp looks red,\r\nand throws a red light into the room, because it is acting as a filter\r\nto the light proceeding from the lamp behind it. The lamp is sending out\r\nlight of many colours, but the glass is only transparent to the red. It\r\nholds up all the others but lets the red pass freely. So if we were to\r\ntake a photograph through a red screen, we should get on the plate only\r\nthose parts which were more or less red in colour. For example, if we\r\nthus photographed a group of three flowers, one red, one orange and one\r\nyellow, the red one would come out prominently, the orange one would\r\ncome out faintly, and the yellow one not at all.\r\n\r\nThen suppose we took the same picture again through a yellow screen. In\r\nthat case the yellow flower would be prominent, the orange would again\r\nbe faint, but the red would be absent.\r\n\r\nHaving got, in imagination, two such negatives, let us make two carbon\r\nprints, one off each. And let the print off the first negative be red,\r\nwhile that off the second is yellow. Let each be, in fact, of the same\r\ncolour as the screen through which the picture was taken. Finally, let\r\nthe two films be placed in contact one upon the other. On holding the\r\ntwo up to the light, what should we see?\r\n\r\nWe should see a red flower, for there would be a red flower clearly\r\ndefined upon one film coinciding with a blank transparent space upon the\r\nother film. We should see, too, a yellow flower, for a clearly defined\r\nyellow flower on the second film would coincide with a clear space upon\r\nthe first. We should see also an orange-coloured flower, for there would\r\nbe a faint red image of it, and a faint yellow image of it, one on each\r\nfilm, lying one over the other, producing the same effect as a mixture\r\nof yellow and red pigments. Thus by taking two negatives through two\r\ncoloured screens, and then colouring the prints to correspond, we can\r\nobtain three colours in the finished picture.\r\n\r\nBy taking a third negative, through a blue screen, we could add\r\nimmensely to the range of colours obtainable. Indeed, with three films,\r\nred, yellow and blue respectively, made through three screens of the\r\nsame colour, a variety of colours practically infinite can be obtained.\r\n\r\nSo the principle is quite simple; the difficulty is in carrying it out.\r\nFor the three kinds of light have not the same photographic power, and\r\nso to avoid upsetting the \"balance\" of the colours different exposures\r\nwould be required for each. Then there is the difficulty of so\r\nmanipulating the films as to get them one over another exactly. Anyone\r\nwho has tried the handling of carbon prints will readily realise how\r\ndifficult this would be. It is possible and has been done, but the\r\nprocess is too uncertain and too laborious to be of general use.\r\n\r\nBut the same result can be attained more or less automatically, as the\r\nfollowing descriptions will show.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to the Lumiere autochrome process, by which the results\r\ndesired can be in a large measure attained by methods of manipulation\r\ncomparatively simple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of The Mining Engineering Co., Ltd.,\r\n                          Sheffield_\r\n\r\n                   PNEUMATIC HAMMER DRILL\r\n\r\nThis tool is used by miners for making holes in hard rock, preliminary\r\nto blasting. Note the spray of water, which prevents the stone dust\r\n     rising and getting into the miner's lungs.--_See_ p. 220]\r\n\r\nThe plates used for this are of a very special nature. In the first\r\nplace, there is the basis of glass, but upon that there is laid what we\r\nmight term the selective screen. This is a layer of starch grains, of\r\nexceeding smallness. The size of them is as little as a half a\r\nthousandth of an inch and there are about four millions of them on every\r\nsquare inch of plate. Next, upon the screen of starch grains is a layer\r\nof waterproof varnish, while over that is the ordinary sensitive\r\nemulsion such as forms the essential part of the usual non-colour plate.\r\n\r\nNow the starch grains which form the screen are, before they are laid\r\non, stained in three colours. Some are blue, some red, and some a\r\nyellowish-green, which experience shows is preferable to pure yellow.\r\nThe differently coloured grains are well mixed, and when the screen is\r\nheld to the light and looked through the effect is almost that of clear\r\nglass. That is because red rays from the red grains, and green and blue\r\nrays from the grains of those colours, all proceed to the eye mingled\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThis plate is placed in the camera differently from the usual way, since\r\nthe glass side is turned towards the lens. The light, therefore, after\r\nentering the camera, passes through the glass, then through the screen,\r\nand finally falls upon the sensitive film.\r\n\r\nSuppose, then, that the camera were pointed to a red wall; red light\r\nwould fall upon the plate and, passing through the red grains, would act\r\nupon the sensitive film behind them. The blue and green grains, on the\r\nother hand, would stop those rays which fell upon them, and so those\r\nparts of the sensitive film which they cover would remain unaffected by\r\nlight. Then, if that plate were to be developed, a dark, opaque spot\r\nwould be produced upon the film under each red grain, the film under the\r\nother grains remaining transparent. Hence, when held up to the light and\r\nlooked through, the plate would appear a greenish-blue, for all the red\r\ngrains would be covered up.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, if the wall were blue instead of red, a greenish-red\r\nplate would result, while if it were green, the plate would be a purple,\r\nthe result of the combination of red and blue.\r\n\r\nBut this, it will be seen, is a topsy-turvy effect, the exact opposite\r\nof what we want, so that it is fortunate that by a simple chemical\r\nmethod we can set it right. After a first development in the ordinary\r\nway the plate is placed in another bath and exposed to strong daylight,\r\nwith the result that those parts which were darkened by the first\r\ndevelopment become clear and the parts which were clear become opaque.\r\nThus, after this twofold development of the photograph of the red wall,\r\nwe find ourselves in possession of a red plate, in which only the red\r\ngrains are visible, since all the others are covered up by opaque parts\r\nof the sensitive film. The photograph of the blue wall will also, after\r\nit has been subjected to the double development, show blue only, and the\r\nsame with the green.\r\n\r\nBut suppose that instead of a red wall or a blue wall we focus our\r\ncamera upon one which is half red and half blue. Then it is easy to\r\nperceive that we shall get a plate which is half one colour and half the\r\nother. Moreover, it follows that a wall covered with a mosaic of red,\r\nblue and green would give us a plate duly coloured in the same way.\r\n\r\nBut when we go a step further and photograph, say, a landscape, which\r\nmay contain a vast range of colours, we find a difficulty in believing\r\nthat they can all be rendered by the simple process of covering or\r\nleaving uncovered grains either blue, red or green. It can be done,\r\nhowever, since the other colours may be made up of two or more of these\r\nthree in varying proportions. For example, should there be something in\r\nthe landscape of a darker, more blue, shade of green than the green\r\ngrains, then the light proceeding from that object, while passing freely\r\nthrough the green grains upon which it falls, will slightly penetrate\r\nthe neighbouring blue ones as well, and so at that point on the plate\r\nthere will be not only green grains visible, but some of the blue grains\r\npartly visible also. The light from the blue grains will enter the eye\r\nalong with that from the green grains, and by so doing will add just\r\nthat amount of blue to the green as to give it the right shade.\r\n\r\nAfter this manner is the whole picture built up. It is, of course,\r\nreally a mosaic, consisting entirely of little coloured patches, but\r\nsince they are so small none can be seen individually, all merging\r\ntogether in the eye so as to form a picture in which colours change\r\nimperceptibly from one into another.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, what happens is this. We start with a layer of coloured\r\ngrains; the action of taking and developing the photograph covers up\r\nsome of these grains and leaves others exposed, and the action of the\r\nlight is such that those which are left visible produce a picture\r\nclosely resembling the original, not only in form but in colour.\r\n\r\nBut there is one other interesting point about this process which\r\ndeserves mention. The differently coloured lights are not of the same\r\npower photographically. Red light, as we know well, is very weak in this\r\nrespect, wherefore, we use it in the dark-room. A faint red light will\r\nhave no perceptible effect upon a plate unless it be exposed to it for\r\nsome time. Blue light, on the other hand, is very active, and were the\r\nblue and red lights to be allowed to act equally on the autochrome\r\nplate, the result would be much too blue. It is therefore necessary to\r\nhandicap the blue light, as it were, by placing a \"reddish-yellowish\"\r\nscreen either just in front of, or just behind, the lens to cut off a\r\nproportion of the blue rays.\r\n\r\nThe other very successful process is known as the Dufay dioptichrome\r\nprocess. It differs very little from the Lumiere except in detail, the\r\nselective screen being formed of small coloured squares instead of by a\r\nmass of little grains.\r\n\r\nIn both, it will be noticed, the result is a single positive. It is not,\r\nas in ordinary photography, a negative off which any desired number of\r\npositive prints can be made. And, moreover, it is a transparency: it\r\ncannot be viewed except by light shining through it. The results are,\r\nhowever, extremely beautiful, when well done, and anyone who cares to\r\ntry either of these methods of working will be well repaid for the\r\ntrouble involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nHOW SCIENCE AIDS THE STRICKEN COLLIER\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing is more characteristic of the present age than the care which\r\nis, quite rightly, expended upon the comfort and safety of those who do\r\nthe manual labour of the community. The stores of scientific knowledge\r\nand skill are drawn upon freely for this end, and some very interesting\r\nexamples can be given of the truly scientific methods which have been\r\nevolved, not only for preventing injuries of any kind, but for\r\nsuccouring those who may, despite those precautions, fall victims to\r\ndisease or accident.\r\n\r\nAn example has already been given of the scientific investigation into\r\nthe nature of colliery explosions and the best means of preventing them.\r\nWe have seen there how expense has been poured out lavishly in fitting\r\nup the experimental gallery or artificial pit, and how the most cunning\r\nmechanical and electrical devices have been pressed into the service in\r\norder to find out just what happens when an explosion occurs. It has\r\nbeen related how these investigations have revealed with certainty the\r\ntrue cause of the explosions and thereby led the way to their\r\nprevention.\r\n\r\nBut with it all there is still an occasional disaster, occurring,\r\nsometimes, at the best and most carefully managed collieries. And\r\ntherefore it is still necessary to provide for rescuing the unfortunate\r\nmen who are affected.\r\n\r\nIt is worth remark, here, that colliery explosions are, all things\r\nconsidered, a very rare occurrence. Because of their dramatic\r\nsuddenness, and the number of lives which are commonly lost in a single\r\ndisaster, we are apt to magnify their severity in our minds and to\r\npicture the life of the miner as a very hazardous one. In point of fact,\r\nthe expectation of life, as the insurance people call it, is quite as\r\ngreat among the coal-miners as among any class of manual labour. And of\r\nthose who do meet an untimely end there are more lost through isolated\r\naccidents, involving one or two men, than in the great disasters.\r\n\r\nTo meet these isolated cases science is almost powerless. For the most\r\npart, they are due to falls of material from the roof of the mine, or\r\nsome simple accident of that kind, caused by an error of judgment or\r\nlack of care on the part of fellow-workmen, and the only safeguard\r\nagainst such is the most careful and systematic supervision, which, in\r\nGreat Britain at all events, is rigidly applied. The underground staff\r\nare very carefully organised with this end in view, and the whole is\r\nsupervised by Government inspectors. No amount of scientific\r\ninvestigation or invention will help much in these matters.\r\n\r\nWith the explosion or fire, however, it is different, for there subtle\r\nforces and strange chemical influences come into play with which science\r\nis specially well fitted to deal.\r\n\r\nTo a great many people the first news of organised, trained and\r\nscientifically equipped rescue parties came at the time of the terrible\r\nCourrieres disaster in France, when over 1000 men lost their lives. For\r\nthen a party with apparatus hurried from Germany and played a prominent\r\npart in the rescue operations. But unfortunately the glamour of their\r\nperformance was somewhat dimmed by the fact that after they had done all\r\nthey could, and had gone home again, more men were rescued. Many,\r\nreading of that fact, were inclined to scoff at the \"new-fangled\" ideas,\r\nthinking that after all the old way of working with a party of brave but\r\nuntrained and often ignorant volunteers was better than the new way of\r\nworking with equipped and trained men. It certainly did seem as if the\r\nformer had succeeded where the latter had failed. But that was quite a\r\nmistake, as subsequent events have shown, and in all probability it was\r\ndue to the fact that the uninstructed party were local men, thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the mine in which they were working, its geography and\r\nits special local conditions, whereas the trained men came from far\r\naway.\r\n\r\nAt all events the pioneer work of the Germans in the matter of rescue\r\nteams has been amply justified by the fact that other people have copied\r\nthem, and none more thoroughly than the mining authorities of Great\r\nBritain. Indeed we see here another instance of the remarkable way in\r\nwhich the British people, though a little slow to take up a new idea, do\r\ntake it up when it has once been established, and in such a way that\r\nthey are soon among the foremost in its use. The Germans, all honour to\r\nthem, started the rescue teams, but at this moment there are rescue\r\nteams and stations for their training in Britain second to none in the\r\nworld. Of these there is a splendid example in the Rhondda Valley, in\r\nSouth Wales, supported and worked by the owners of the pits in that\r\ndistrict, besides others at Aberdare, in the same neighbourhood, at\r\nMansfield, to serve the collieries in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire;\r\nindeed rescue stations are now dotted throughout the mining districts.\r\n\r\nThe general idea of these stations is as follows. The building is\r\ncentrally situated in the district which it is intended to serve, and in\r\nit are kept an ample supply of the necessary appliances, in the shape of\r\nbreathing apparatus, which enables men to walk unhurt through poisonous\r\ngas, reviving apparatus, by which partially suffocated men can be\r\nbrought round again by the administration of oxygen, together with\r\nquantities of that valuable gas in suitable portable cylinders.\r\nEverything which forethought can suggest as even possibly useful in an\r\nemergency is kept in a constant state of readiness. And all the while a\r\nswift motor car stands ready to carry them to the scene of operations.\r\n\r\nBut the appliances are of little use without men to work them, who know\r\nthem and can trust them. The case of David, who felt able to do better\r\nwork with his sling and stone than in all the panoply of Saul's armour,\r\nbecause he \"had not proved it,\" is typical of a universal human\r\ninstinct. A man feels safer unarmed, or simply armed, than he does with\r\nthe most elaborate weapons in which he has not learned to have\r\nconfidence. And therefore the men who may be called upon to work this\r\napparatus are first taught to have confidence in it. Each station has\r\nits instructor, who is usually also the general superintendent of the\r\nstation, and \"galleries\" in which the instruction can be carried out.\r\n\r\nVolunteers are called for in each colliery and a number of the most\r\nsuitable men are chosen to undergo training, preference being given,\r\nvery naturally, to those who are already trained, as fortunately so many\r\nworkmen are nowadays, in ambulance work.\r\n\r\nThese chosen men then repair at intervals to the station to undergo a\r\nproper course of instruction. The instructor, often an ex-non-commissioned\r\nofficer in the Royal Engineers, accustomed, therefore, to engineering\r\nmatters, and also to systematic discipline, there puts them through a\r\ncourse of drill the object of which is to teach them to work together as\r\na squad under the orders of a properly constituted chief. Thus when called\r\nupon in some emergency there will be no confusion, but each man will know\r\nwhat to do, and a few short words of command from the chief will serve\r\nbetter than the long explanations which would be necessary with an\r\nundisciplined body. It welds the individual men, as it were, into a\r\nsmoothly working machine, thereby increasing the efficiency of the whole.\r\nAnd arrangements are made whereby, should the leader fail, another man\r\nsteps into his place of authority at once and without question.\r\n\r\nThen, having thus brought them under a suitable discipline, the\r\ninstructor takes his men into the experimental gallery. This may be\r\ndescribed as a long, low, narrow shed, in which are timber props and\r\nbeams, rails on the floor, heaps of coal, all things, in fact, which may\r\ntend to make it closely resemble the actual workings of a coal-mine\r\nafter they have been shaken and shattered by the force of an explosion.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty, in a real disaster, arises from what are known as\r\n\"falls.\" The roof of the mine is normally supported by timbers, and\r\nthese the explosion moves, so that in places many tons of the earth of\r\nwhich the roof of the mine consists will fall and block completely the\r\n\"roads\" or tunnels which communicate from the shaft to the places where\r\nthe men are at work. These, of course, have to be removed or burrowed\r\nthrough before the men imprisoned in the distant workings can be\r\nreached. The rescue party do not, of course, wait to clear away the\r\nwhole of this debris, only just enough to enable them to crawl through\r\nor over it, but even then it often represents the waste of precious\r\nhours, and the expenditure of great exertions, to get past a \"fall.\" So\r\nat intervals \"falls\" are made in the gallery, in order that men may be\r\npractised in dealing with them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of W. E. Garforth, Esq., Pontefract_\r\n\r\n                        AN ARTIFICIAL COAL MINE\r\n\r\nThese two photographs show the clouds of flame and smoke issuing from\r\nthe mouth of the \"Artificial Coal Mine\" during the experiments described\r\n                            in the text]\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to give a brief statement of the training\r\nundergone by the men at the Mansfield Rescue Station. In that case, it\r\nshould be stated, the gallery is made double, so that men can go one way\r\nand return the other back to their starting-point. Having donned their\r\nbreathing apparatus, they enter the gallery, which, by the way, is\r\nfilled with smoke and foul gas. Passing along it, they encounter two\r\nfalls, which they must get over or through; then they have to set twelve\r\ntimber props as might be necessary to maintain the safety of a damaged\r\nroad in the mine; all that they do three times over. Then they are\r\nrequired to bring up and lay 250 bricks, a thing which might also be\r\nnecessary in an actual emergency, after which they have to fix up\r\n\"brattice cloth\" in a part of the gallery. One of the first duties, of\r\ncourse, for a rescue party is to restore the circulation of air in the\r\nmine, and brattice cloth is a rough kind of cloth which is put to guide\r\nthe air currents. That done, they have to take a dummy representing a\r\nman of 14 stone, put it on a stretcher, and carry it round the gallery\r\nand over the falls. Finally, they restore the timber, bricks and cloth,\r\nand their turn of work is done. The total time required for this is two\r\nhours, and during the whole of that period they are, of course,\r\nbreathing not the natural air, but the artificial atmosphere provided\r\nfor them by the apparatus with which each man is provided. The chief\r\npoint of this part of the training, as has been remarked already, is to\r\naccustom the men to the wearing of the apparatus and to doing work in\r\nit. By this means they gain confidence in it, and get to know that it\r\nwill not fail them in the time of trial.\r\n\r\nThe course of instruction consists of ten drills such as has been\r\ndescribed, after which the men are called up twice a year, just to\r\nrefresh their memories.\r\n\r\nOne side of the gallery is glazed, so that the instructor can watch his\r\nmen at work without of necessity being inside himself, and there are\r\nemergency doors as well, which can be opened to let a man out should the\r\nordeal be too much for him. The necessary \"fumes\" are generated in a\r\nstove and driven into the gallery by a fan. The stations are beautifully\r\nfitted up, with baths for the men to wash after their somewhat dirty\r\nexperience in the gallery, and everything is done for their convenience\r\nand welfare.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this systematic training of a great number of men is\r\nthat there are men at each colliery who can be called upon when needed.\r\nThe team of strangers, as has been remarked, partially failed at\r\nCourrieres, largely because they were strangers, but when every colliery\r\nhas a team ready, composed of its own men, then clearly there is the\r\ngreatest chance of success. The central station of the district is the\r\ntraining-ground where the men go from all the collieries to get the\r\nexperience and instruction, and where a reserve store of appliances is\r\nkept. In many cases, of course, the collieries have their own\r\nappliances, so that work can be begun at once, without having to wait\r\nfor that from the rescue station, but the latter forms a reserve in case\r\nof need, and, being kept under the care of an expert, it is naturally\r\nalways in the best possible working order.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the cost of these stations, it may be stated that the\r\none at Porth, in the Rhondda Valley, cost, including equipment, L7000,\r\nwhile the one at Mansfield cost L3000. This first cost and the expense\r\nof maintenance is borne by the collieries of the district in proportion\r\nto the quantity of coal which they raise.\r\n\r\nAnd now we can turn to the apparatus itself, without which the\r\norganisation already described would be of little value.\r\n\r\nThere are several makes of these, but a description of the particular\r\napparatus used at the two stations mentioned will serve as an\r\nillustration. The purpose, of course, is to give the wearer an\r\natmosphere of his own, which he can carry about with him, and which will\r\nrender him quite independent of the ordinary atmosphere and quite\r\nindifferent to the poisonous nature of the gases around him. To this end\r\nhis mouth and nostrils must be cut off from the outer world altogether.\r\nThere are two ways of doing this. In the one there is used a helmet, or\r\nperhaps mask would be the better term. This fits right over the man's\r\nface, an air-tight joint being made between the helmet and his head by\r\nmeans of a rubber washer which can be inflated with air. The inflation\r\nis accomplished by squeezing a rubber ball on the right-hand side of the\r\nhelmet. In the centre is a glass window through which he can see easily,\r\nand since this is apt to become clouded by the dampness of his breath\r\nthere is a wiper inside, which can be turned by a knob on the outside,\r\nso that by simply turning his knob with his hand he can clean the window\r\nat any time that may be necessary. Two soft pads inside the helmet bear\r\none on the man's forehead and the other on his chin, and these, working\r\nin conjunction with a strap which passes right round the back of his\r\nhead, keep the thing firmly in position. In addition there is combined\r\nwith the helmet a leather skull-cap which, being continued down behind,\r\ngives good protection to the head and neck.\r\n\r\nThe other form of apparatus consists of a mouth-piece and nose-clip. The\r\nmouth-piece, as its name implies, fits in the man's mouth, being\r\nsupported and kept in position by a strap passing behind the back of his\r\nhead. Combined with it is a little screw clip which closes his nostrils.\r\nThe man also wears a leather skull-cap, from which straps depend to\r\nbear the weight of the mouth-piece and its attached tubes, so that the\r\nweight does not fall upon his mouth.\r\n\r\nEither of these arrangements, it is clear, cuts him off from\r\ncommunication with the outer air, but that is only half the problem, for\r\nhe must be given a substitute or he will be suffocated.\r\n\r\nThis part of the appliance he carries, knapsack fashion, upon his back.\r\nFirst there is a rectangular case, called the regenerator, with, below\r\nit, two small cylinders of compressed oxygen. A suitable arrangement of\r\npipes connects these together, and to the helmet or mouth-piece as the\r\ncase may be.\r\n\r\nWhen the man exhales, as we all know, the air which he then discharges\r\nfrom his lungs is deficient in oxygen and instead contains carbonic acid\r\ngas. The latter must be got rid of and replaced by pure oxygen. The\r\nexhaled air is therefore led down a pipe to the regenerator, where it\r\ncomes into contact with several trays of caustic soda, a chemical which\r\nhas a great affinity for carbonic acid. The result is that the latter\r\ngas is extracted from the impure air, finding a more congenial home in\r\nthe caustic soda. It is then necessary to restore the normal quantity of\r\noxygen, and so, as the air passes on, it meets, in a little apparatus\r\nknown as an injector, a spray of pure oxygen from the cylinders. Thus,\r\nafter being purified and re-oxygenated, the air passes on through more\r\npipes to the helmet or mouth-piece, to be breathed once more. The\r\napparatus contains sufficient oxygen and caustic soda for this to go on\r\nfor a space of two hours.\r\n\r\nBut during times of extra exertion a man needs more air than at others,\r\nfor which provision has to be made, and so on his chest the rescuer\r\ncarries a flexible bag divided into two compartments. Through one of\r\nthese the exhaled air passes on its way to the regenerator, while\r\nthrough the other the oxygenated air flows on its way to the man's\r\nmouth. When he is breathing hard, then, during a moment of extra\r\nexertion, and when, therefore, he is turning out bad air faster than it\r\ncan be purified, and drawing in pure air faster than it can be\r\nproduced, this bag comes to his aid. From the store of oxygenated air in\r\none side of it he draws the extra which he requires, while the other\r\nside stores up temporarily the excess of vitiated air, until the\r\nregenerator is able to overtake its work. Thus at all times, whether\r\nbreathing ordinarily or heavily, the apparatus can respond to his\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nThe spray of oxygen as it escapes from the cylinders into the injector\r\nhas the effect of driving the air along, so that the circulation through\r\nthe tubes and the regenerator is automatic, and the foul air flows away\r\nfrom the man's mouth and the new air comes back to him quite without\r\neffort on his part. As time goes on, of course, and the stored oxygen\r\nbecomes used up, the pressure in the cylinders falls, which fall, shown\r\nupon a little pressure-gauge, tells the man how much longer time he has\r\nbefore he must return for fresh supplies of oxygen and soda. Fresh\r\ncylinders of oxygen can be connected up very quickly in place of the\r\nempty ones, while a fresh regenerator can be put in, or new caustic soda\r\nsupplied, in a very short time.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent of the Mansfield station has invented what is termed\r\na \"self-rescue\" apparatus, to be used in conjunction with that which has\r\nbeen described above. It is simpler and lighter than the rescue\r\napparatus, and will not keep a man supplied with air for more than an\r\nhour or an hour and a quarter. Moreover, it is not automatic, since the\r\nflow of oxygen has to be controlled by the man himself. Since, however,\r\nit consists only of a mouth-piece, a breathing-bag and a cylinder of\r\noxygen, it is very portable, and may well be carried by a rescue party\r\nfor the use of any men who may be discovered alive beyond the danger\r\nzone. It may well happen, indeed it often has happened, that a remote\r\npart of a mine, although cut off from the shaft by passages full of\r\n\"after-damp,\" as the foul gases caused by the explosion are termed, may\r\nitself contain fairly pure air in which men can live for a long time. If\r\nsuch men be reached, the difficulty is to get them through the passages\r\ncontaining the bad air. Consequently a rescue party which carried one\r\nor two of these light forms of apparatus could equip such men with them\r\nand then they could pass out with safety.\r\n\r\nAnother use, the one, in fact, from which the appliance draws its name,\r\nis the facility with which, by its aid, a man could set right a chance\r\ndefect in his ordinary rescue apparatus. Suppose, for example, that a\r\nfully equipped man found something wrong, whereby he was prevented from\r\ngetting his proper supply of purified air. Then, if the party had one of\r\nthe self-rescue sets with them, he could slip off his helmet or\r\nmouth-piece, quickly replacing it, for a time, with the self-rescue\r\nmouth-piece. This might enable him to reach safety, or even to put the\r\nother apparatus right and then don it once more. The whole thing can be\r\npacked up into a small tin case which can be slung over one shoulder,\r\nand with the oxygen cylinder slung over the other one the complete\r\noutfit can be carried quite easily by a man in addition to what he is\r\nwearing himself.\r\n\r\nStill another form of breathing appliance may well be taken on these\r\nrescue expeditions, and that is the reviving apparatus, for use upon\r\nthose who have apparently ceased to breathe. In this case a mask is put\r\nover the sufferer's mouth and nose, and then the turning of a lever into\r\na certain position causes oxygen to escape from a cylinder in such a way\r\nas to cause a suction which empties the man's lungs of the bad gases\r\nwhich have laid him low. That done, another movement of the lever and a\r\ndeep breath of oxygen flows into his lungs in their place. Thus by\r\nalternating the positions of the lever an artificial respiration is set\r\nup far more effective than can possibly be attained by the ordinary\r\nmethod of moving the man's arms and pressing his chest. Indeed there are\r\ncases, such as when his arms or ribs are injured, when the ordinary\r\nmethod is impossible, but it is hard to imagine an instance when this\r\nbeneficent apparatus could not be used, and so long as there be any\r\nspark of life left in the poor fellow there seems to be every reason to\r\nexpect a complete revival as the result of its use.\r\n\r\nOf course there are many other places where poisonous gases are likely\r\nto be met with, such as gas-works, chemical-works, limeworks, and so on,\r\nwhere this apparatus may be kept with advantage, in case of accident.\r\n\r\nIndeed all that has been described above has its use apart from colliery\r\nexplosions, although they are the outstanding opportunities for its\r\nemployment. Old workings, tunnels which have been empty for a time,\r\nsewers--all these have, on occasion, to be entered, not to mention\r\nhouses full of smoke, or factories full of chemical fumes, all of which\r\nform cases in which the rescue apparatus would find useful employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nHOW SCIENCE HELPS TO KEEP US WELL\r\n\r\n\r\nOne branch of science--medical science--concerns itself almost entirely\r\nwith health, but it would be out of place to refer to such matters here,\r\neven if the present writer were capable of doing justice to the subject.\r\nA new medicine or a new method of operating upon a suffering patient\r\nwould be quite correctly described as a scientific marvel, but it is not\r\nof such that this chapter deals, but rather with those great works by\r\nwhich the engineer, often taught by the medical man, promotes the health\r\nof a whole community.\r\n\r\nMost important of these, perhaps, is the provision of pure water. Some\r\nplaces are more fortunately situated than others in this respect, being\r\nnear streams flowing down from mountains clear and unpolluted, which can\r\nbe drunk after the minimum of purification. Others have to make use of\r\nthe waters of a moderately clean river, as London does those of the\r\nThames and Lea, in which cases the greatest care has to be exercised in\r\nthe filtration of the liquid before it can be sent out through the mains\r\nfor domestic consumption.\r\n\r\nIn this particular domain invention has been comparatively slow. There\r\nare novel pumps, it is true, for handling the water, such as the\r\nHumphrey Gas Pump, which the Metropolitan Water Board (London) have\r\ninstalled for filling their great reservoirs at Chingford. In these an\r\nexplosion of gas is the motive force. Water flows by gravitation into a\r\nhuge iron pipe closed at the top but open at the bottom. It is so\r\narranged that a quantity of gas shall be entrapped in the upper end,\r\nwhich, being exploded by an electric spark, drives the mass of water\r\nout. Some of it, together with a quantity of fresh water, presently\r\ncomes surging back, entrapping a fresh supply of gas and causing a new\r\nexplosion; and so it goes on over and over again. The particular pumps\r\nat the waterworks referred to discharge about fourteen tons of water at\r\neach explosion, of which there are nine every minute.\r\n\r\nThe special effect of these machines, however, is not to improve the\r\npublic health so much as to relieve the public pocket, for their chief\r\nfeature is that they work more economically than any other kind of pump.\r\n\r\nThe filters, by which the water is purified, are simply layers of sand,\r\nmuch the same as have been in use for many years, although in some cases\r\nchemistry is brought in and the work of the filters aided by the action\r\nof precipitants. These are substances which combine in some way with the\r\nimpurities in the water, and carry them to the bottom of the tank or\r\nreservoir, while the pure water remains to be drawn off from the top.\r\n\r\nThis is also the most usual method by which water is softened. Hardness\r\nin water is due to the presence of certain salts which are dissolved out\r\nof the ground as the water percolates through it, and which are absent\r\nfrom rain-water. To get rid of these the hard water has chemicals mixed\r\nwith it in a tank, from which it flows slowly through another tank. The\r\neffect of the added chemicals is to convert the soluble salts in the\r\nwater into insoluble particles, which then tend to fall down to the\r\nbottom of the containing vessel. The slow passage through the second\r\ntank is intended to give the particles time to settle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTIONAL VIEW OF HYDRAULIC BUFFER AND RUNNING-OUT\r\n               PRESSES OF A 60-POUNDER GUN]\r\n\r\nFinally, to make sure that these have been all got rid of, the water\r\ntraverses a filter, and then it is for all practical purposes as soft as\r\nrain-water. Some people are frightened of this artificially softened\r\nwater, on the ground that chemicals have been added to it, supposing,\r\napparently, that when they use such water they are really employing a\r\nchemical solution. That is quite wrong, however, for the added\r\nchemicals, combining with the \"hardness,\" form substances which are\r\nquite easily extracted from the water altogether. If we liken the\r\nhardness to a number of pickpockets in a crowd, and the added chemicals\r\nto a number of policemen who come in to arrest the said pickpockets,\r\nfinally leaving the crowd free from both pickpockets and policemen, we\r\nget a simple illustration of what takes place.\r\n\r\nBut almost equally important as the provision of pure water is the\r\neffective dealing with the drainage of a large town. Much offensive\r\nmatter flows under the streets of our towns and cities, and if it is not\r\nto become a nuisance it must be scientifically dealt with.\r\n\r\nYears ago the drains of London simply emptied themselves into the\r\nThames, until, in 1864, two large drains were constructed, one on each\r\nside of, and approximately parallel with, the river, to intercept the\r\nold drains and to carry their contents to points many miles down towards\r\nthe sea. Even that, however, by no means abated the evil, for it simply\r\ntransferred it to a new place. The river was as foul as ever.\r\n\r\nWilliam Morris, in _News from Nowhere_, pictures the catching of salmon\r\nin the Thames off Chelsea, while one of London's prominent citizens,\r\nreferring to what was being done in the direction of purifying the\r\nriver, jocosely promised the members of Parliament a little fly-fishing\r\nat Westminster. Equally remote, it is to be feared, from actual\r\naccomplishment, these two prophecies do certainly indicate the tendency\r\nof events, for science has enabled the authorities to relieve the\r\nlong-suffering river of much of the pollution which they used to thrust\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\nThe first great step was the introduction, in 1887, of a treatment in\r\nprinciple very like that just described for softening water. The liquid\r\nfrom the drains is gathered into large reservoirs, where chemicals are\r\nadded to it, causing the heavier matter to be precipitated in the form\r\nknown as \"sludge.\"\r\n\r\nThe liquid portion, or \"effluent,\" as it is called, which is left is\r\ndischarged into the river just as the tide is ebbing, so that it is\r\ncarried right away, and, being comparatively inoffensive, it pollutes\r\nthe river very little indeed. The sludge, on the other hand, is pumped\r\ninto special steamers, which carry it down to a certain spot off the\r\nThames Estuary, where they drop it into the sea. The currents at the\r\nparticular spot chosen are such that none of it returns to the river.\r\n\r\nFor a similar purpose electrolysis has been employed. In this process\r\nthe sewage is made to flow between two iron plates which are connected\r\nup to a source of electric current so that they form electrodes, while\r\nthe sewage is the electrolyte. The current decomposes the liquid sewage,\r\ncausing chlorine and oxygen to be deposited upon that plate which forms\r\nthe anode. This deodorises and purifies the sewage, in addition to which\r\niron salts are formed on the iron plates, the effect of which is to\r\nprecipitate the solid particles. Thus the same result is achieved as\r\nwhen chemicals are used, the main difference being that instead of\r\nchemicals being added, they are produced by the passage of the current.\r\n\r\nBut, from the scientific point of view, the most interesting process of\r\nall is that in which bacteria or microbes are brought into the service.\r\nThe fact is familiar to most people that there are certain minute\r\norganisms which cause terrible diseases. It is not so well known that\r\nthere are still more of them whose action is extremely beneficent. The\r\nwriter has seen these minute living things described in a popular book\r\nas \"insects,\" but they really belong to a low order of plant life, and,\r\nas has been said in an earlier chapter, in spite of the lowliness of\r\ntheir status in the order of creation, they are able to accomplish\r\ncertain chemical processes which baffle the cleverest men. They are\r\nparticularly good, or some of them are at any rate, at forming compounds\r\nin which nitrogen forms a part. Further, they can be divided into two\r\nclasses, the aerobic and the anaerobic. The former work best in air,\r\nwhile the latter need an absence of air while they perform their\r\nfunctions. After which preliminary explanation we can proceed to\r\ndescribe how they are induced to carry on this valuable work for\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nThe sewage flows first of all into a tank from which light and air are\r\nexcluded as far as possible. There the anaerobic microbes flourish and\r\nmultiply, and in the course of their life work they convert the sewage\r\ninto an inoffensive liquid. After an appropriate interval the liquid\r\npasses to filter-beds, where it trickles over and through beds of coke,\r\nthe effect of which is to aerate it very thoroughly, whereby the aerobic\r\nmicrobes come into action, completing the good work, so that nothing is\r\nleft except a clean, colourless and odourless liquid. Indeed it is more\r\nthan that, for the microbes have turned the offensive matter into\r\nnitrogenous compounds which, as we have seen in a previous chapter, are\r\nthe best fertilisers. Hence this effluent, if placed upon the soil, is\r\nof great value.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this to towns which are not blessed, like London, with\r\na broad river and the sea near at hand needs no explanation.\r\n\r\nThe bacteria necessary to carry on the process are always present in\r\nsewage, and after any particular plant has been in operation for a\r\nlittle while there results an accumulation of them, so that the process\r\nbecomes more and more active as time goes on. Mechanical ingenuity has\r\nso arranged matters that a sewage disposal plant on this system can be\r\nmade quite automatic, requiring little or no attention for months\r\ntogether, the raw sewage flowing in at one end, while the odourless,\r\nharmless effluent pours out at the other.\r\n\r\nAnd, moreover, so powerful is the action of these beneficent bacteria\r\nthat should disease germs come down in the sewage they soon destroy\r\nthem. No chemicals are needed, for the bacteria replenish themselves. No\r\nsludge is left, everything being turned into the harmless effluent. And,\r\nit may be said once more, disease germs are destroyed. Of all the\r\nvaluable inventions of modern times this is surely not one of the\r\nleast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nMODERN ARTILLERY\r\n\r\n\r\nEven as late as the time of the Crimean War guns, even the largest, were\r\nmade of that extremely common material, cast-iron. In fact, so far as\r\nmaterial went, there was no difference between a gun and a water-pipe.\r\n\r\nIt was the need for some material possessing strength comparable with\r\nthat of steel combined with the ease of production of cast-iron which\r\nled Sir Henry Bessemer to experiment in the manufacture of steel. Out of\r\nthose experiments came Bessemer steel and its near relative, Siemens\r\nsteel, two materials of universal application at the present time, so\r\nthat to the needs of the artilleryman we owe two inventions which have\r\nproved of infinite value in peace as well as in war.\r\n\r\nIf any particular piece of ordnance can be said to be the prime\r\nfavourite with the English-speaking peoples, it is the big naval gun.\r\nWith both British and Americans the navy takes pride of place; both\r\nnations are given to contemplating with pleasure the number of\r\ndreadnoughts which they possess, and the distinguishing feature of a\r\ndreadnought is the large number of big guns which it carries.\r\n\r\nOf the latest of these gigantic weapons one may not speak, but much is\r\nalready public property concerning the 12-inch gun which the original\r\n_Dreadnought_ carried, and which is probably followed in its general\r\nfeatures by the still greater guns of the most recent ships.\r\n\r\nA gun is spoken of by its \"calibre,\" which means the inside diameter,\r\nor, to use another expression, the size of the \"bore.\" So the \"12-inch\"\r\nnaval gun is 12 inches in the bore. Its length is in some cases 45\r\ncalibres and in others 50 calibres. In other words, some are 45 feet\r\nlong and others 50 feet.\r\n\r\nWhy the difference? someone may ask. The answer is that the longer ones\r\nare an improved type. The extra length gives longer range and harder\r\nhits, as is quite apparent after a little thought. The explosive \"goes\r\noff\" and forthwith commences to drive the shell towards the muzzle. So\r\nlong as it is in the gun the shell is being pushed faster and faster,\r\nbut so soon as it leaves the muzzle the pushing ceases and the shell is\r\nleft to pursue its course with its own momentum. Therefore, generally\r\nspeaking, one may say that the longer the gun the faster will be the\r\nspeed of the shell as it leaves the muzzle, the farther will it go and\r\nthe harder will be the blow at a given range.\r\n\r\nIncidentally this explanation reveals the need for different kinds of\r\nexplosive. The propellant whose function it is to drive the shell out of\r\nthe gun is different from that with which the shell is itself filled.\r\nThe former needs to act comparatively slowly, so that it may continue\r\nits pushing action during the whole time that the shell is travelling\r\nalong the gun. It might be ever so powerful, but were its action too\r\nsudden it would simply tend to burst the gun, without imparting very\r\nmuch speed to the shell. On arrival at its destination, however, the\r\nshell needs to burst suddenly and violently.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting question arises at this point. Seeing how fast is\r\neven the slowest speed at which a projectile travels, how can it be\r\npossible to measure the rate at which a shell issues from one of these\r\nmonster guns. Needless to say, it is electricity which makes a thing\r\napparently so difficult really quite easy.\r\n\r\nNear the gun is set up a frame with a wire zigzagging to and fro across\r\nit, in such a manner that when the gun is fired the shell is bound to\r\ncut the wire. Electric current is made to pass through this wire on its\r\nway to a suitable house in which are recording instruments, where it\r\nenergises a magnet and so holds something up. Now it is easy to see\r\nthat as soon as the shell cuts the wire the current will stop, the\r\nmagnet will \"let go\" and the \"something\" will drop.\r\n\r\nAt a certain distance farther on there is a second frame with wires upon\r\nit, through which passes a second current, which is also led to the\r\ninstrument house, where it again operates a second magnet.\r\n\r\nWhen the first magnet releases its hold it drops something, to wit, a\r\nlong lead weight. When the second magnet lets go it permits a second\r\nweight to fall against the first and make a dent or scratch upon it. The\r\nlonger the interval between the action of the two magnets the higher up\r\nupon the lead weight will the scratch be. The apparatus, in short, will\r\nregister the distance fallen through by the lead weight between the\r\nbreaking of the wire in the first frame and the breaking of the wire in\r\nthe second frame.\r\n\r\nNow a falling object, if only it has such weight that the resistance of\r\nthe air is negligible, falls according to a well-understood law, which\r\nlaw it obeys with the utmost accuracy. Therefore the distance fallen by\r\nthe weight between the passage of the shell through two points gives a\r\nvery accurate record of the time taken to travel from one to the other.\r\nOf course several such frames can be used if desired in the same way.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the gun itself. It is not merely one piece of metal but\r\nseveral tubes beautifully fitted one inside another. Moreover, in the\r\nBritish gun at all events, between two of the tubes there is a space\r\nfilled with \"wire.\"\r\n\r\nThis wire is perhaps better described as steel tape, and is of the\r\nfinest material for the purpose, flexible and tremendously strong. It is\r\nwound round and round one of the tubes until there are many miles of it\r\non a single gun. It is wound tightly, too, by means of special\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the wire is to resist cracking. The solid steel tubes may\r\ncrack, and, as is the way with all cracks, these will tend to grow\r\nlonger and longer. The many turns of wire, however, will not crack. Even\r\nif a few turns should break, the damage will not spread, and the gun\r\ncan probably go on as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nThe material of which these guns are made is nickel chrome gun steel.\r\nSteel is ordinarily an alloy of iron and carbon, but this metal also\r\ncontains traces of nickel and chromium, which make it specially suitable\r\nfor its special purpose.\r\n\r\nEach of the tubes of which the gun is formed start as an ingot, a mere\r\nlump of metal, but roughly shaped. The requisite mixture is obtained in\r\na furnace and the molten metal is run out into a mould. The ingot is\r\nheated again and pressed under enormous hydraulic presses until it is\r\napproximately the shape required. This pressing not only produces the\r\ndesired shape, it also improves the quality of the metal.\r\n\r\nThe rough forging is then bored out, to make it into a tube. One is\r\ninclined to wonder why the ingot is not cast hollow to commence with,\r\nand so save the labour of boring it all out later. The explanation of\r\nthis is that certain impurities are always present in the metal and\r\nthese always gather together in the part which sets last. Now in a solid\r\nblock or ingot it is clear that the centre is the part which will set\r\nlast, and hence that is the part where the impurities will congregate.\r\nThen, when the centre part is all bored out the impurities are entirely\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThe tube is shaped externally by being turned in a lathe.\r\n\r\nThe innermost tube is not simply smooth. There is a spiral groove,\r\ncalled the \"rifling,\" running round and round, screw fashion, inside it.\r\nThe purpose of this is to give the shell a spinning action which causes\r\nit to keep point foremost throughout its flight. But for this the shell\r\nwould tend to turn over and over, resulting in uncertain and inaccurate\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nThe shell is a little smaller than the bore of the gun, but near its\r\nbase it has an encircling band of soft copper, which band is a tight fit\r\nin the gun. The soft copper crushes into the \"rifling,\" whereby the\r\nshell obtains its spinning action.\r\n\r\nThe large guns are mounted in pairs, each pair on a turntable, by the\r\nmovement of which to right or left they are trained upon the distant\r\ntarget. The turntable is surrounded by a wall of thick armour and is\r\ncovered by an iron hood or roof.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being turnable to right or left, there is, of course,\r\nprovision for raising or depressing the direction in which each gun is\r\npointing. They need always to point more or less upwards, and the\r\nparticular angle depends upon the range or distance of the object aimed\r\nat. This is ascertained by range-finding instruments and communicated to\r\nthe officers in the turrets, as the covered turntables are called. The\r\nguns are then elevated or depressed to suit the range.\r\n\r\nEach gun rests upon a cradle which is itself fitted upon a slide. When\r\nit is fired it \"kicks\" backwards, against the force of a buffer of\r\nsprings, or a hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder. Thus after each shot the\r\ngun moves backwards upon the slide, but the hydraulic apparatus brings\r\nit back again into position for firing almost instantaneously.\r\n\r\nIn naval guns all the movements, including that of the turntable, are by\r\npower, either hydraulic or electric, or a combination of the two. The\r\nloading is also by power.\r\n\r\nThe shells and ammunition are kept well down towards the bottom of the\r\nship, under each turret. Lifts bring them up from there to a chamber\r\njust beneath the turntable, known as the working chamber. Here a small\r\nquantity only is kept, and that for as short a time as possible before\r\nit is sent up by other hoists straight to the guns themselves. The\r\nhoists are so arranged that, no matter how they may be elevated or\r\ndepressed, the ammunition is delivered exactly opposite the breech, as\r\nthe rear end of a gun is termed. Then a mechanical rammer pushes it\r\nstraight in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:        RIFLES OF DIFFERENT NATIONS\r\n                                                     (_See_ Appendix)]\r\n\r\nThe breech of the gun is closed by a beautiful piece of mechanism called\r\nthe breech-block. It is really a huge plug which securely closes the end\r\nof the gun, a partial turn after it is in place fixing it firmly enough\r\nto resist all the force of the explosion. Yet it can be freed and\r\nswung back upon hinges in a few seconds. At the same moment that it is\r\nopened a jet of air blows into the gun, clearing out all effects of the\r\nrecent explosion.\r\n\r\nThe process of firing one of these guns may thus be summarised. The\r\nturntable is swivelled to right or left until the gunners, looking\r\nthrough the sights, which are really telescopes, see the object straight\r\nin front of them. Meanwhile the sights have been set according to the\r\nrange--that is to say, they have been so set in relation to the gun\r\nitself that when they point directly at the target the gun will be\r\npointed upwards at exactly the right angle for that range. The whole\r\nthing, therefore, gun and sights combined, is tilted upwards or\r\ndownwards as may be necessary until the sights point directly at the\r\nobject aimed at. Then at a signal the gun is fired by electricity. The\r\nshock causes the gun to slide backwards upon its supporting slide, but\r\nthe buffers, having taken the shock automatically, return it to its\r\nposition again; the aim is thus undisturbed and it is ready for the next\r\nshot. These enormous guns can be fired at the rate of one shot every\r\nfifteen seconds.\r\n\r\nField guns are in principle very similar to these, only, of course, they\r\nare much smaller and are mounted upon carriages, so that they can be\r\nquickly moved from place to place. It must be borne in mind, however,\r\nthat there are in the case of land guns two distinct types. Field guns,\r\nlike naval guns, fire straight at their target; howitzers or mortars\r\nfire upwards with a view to letting the shell fall on the target from\r\nabove. The latter are, generally speaking, short, fat, stumpy guns, as\r\ncompared with the long, slender field guns.\r\n\r\nIn the field all guns have to be loaded by hand. The elaborate system of\r\nhoists which enables the great naval guns to be loaded with such\r\nrapidity is obviously impossible. That has to be compensated for by the\r\nskill and quickness of the gunners themselves, and it is indeed\r\nastonishing to see with what deftness they can handle the heavy and\r\ndangerous projectiles.\r\n\r\nWith all guns, of whatever kind, range-finding is of the utmost\r\nimportance. No projectile, however fast it may travel, really moves in a\r\nstraight line. It must be fired more or less upwards in order to\r\ncompensate for the downward pull of gravity. If the elevation be\r\ninsufficient the shell will fall short; if it be too much it may go\r\nbeyond the mark, or it may fall short, according to circumstances. Just\r\nthe right elevation is absolutely essential for good shooting. And for\r\nthat to be achieved the range must be known with the utmost possible\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\nThere are various systems and instruments used for this purpose, but all\r\ndepend upon the same principle. It is the principle underlying all\r\nsurveying and all astronomy; indeed it is the only possible principle\r\nfor measuring a distance when you cannot actually go and lay a measure\r\nupon it or by it.\r\n\r\nIt is based upon a peculiar property of a triangle. In the case of every\r\ntriangle which has straight sides, if we know the size of two of the\r\nangles and the length of one of the sides we can easily calculate all\r\nthat there is to be known about that triangle. We unconsciously use the\r\nprinciple when we judge a distance with our eyes. We focus each eye\r\nseparately upon the object which we are looking at. In other words, each\r\nof our eyes looks along a straight line terminating in the object. Those\r\ntwo lines, together with a line joining our two eyes, form a triangle.\r\nThe line between our eyes is the \"base,\" the line of which we know the\r\nlength, while the directions in which we point our eyes give us the\r\nangles at each end of the base. From this we are able to judge the\r\ndistance of the object. Of course there is probably not one of us who\r\nknows the length of that natural \"base\" in inches, but that does not\r\nmatter in this case, since it is always the same whatever we may look\r\nat, and so the mere inclination of the eyes gives us a means of\r\ncomparing distances. When we judge by the eye alone, what we really do\r\nis to draw upon our experience and consciously or unconsciously compare\r\nthe distance which we are estimating with some others which we already\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nIn surveying, a telescope is set up at one end of a base-line and\r\npointed first at the other end of the base-line and then at the distant\r\nobject. A scale with which the instrument is provided gives us the size\r\nof the angle between the two. Then the same thing is done at the other\r\nend of the \"base\" and the similar angle there is obtained. The length of\r\nthe base being known, the distance of the remote object can then be\r\ncalculated.\r\n\r\nIn the same way two observations can be made, one at each end of a ship,\r\nthe length of the ship forming the base-line. Or an instrument can be\r\nmade by which two observations can be made simultaneously by the same\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThis is done by means of mirrors which are turned so that the same\r\nobject is seen in both of them, apparently in a straight line. The\r\nextent to which one of them has to be turned gives the angle, and the\r\ninstrument forms the base.\r\n\r\nAnyone with the slightest geometrical experience will perceive at once\r\nthat the best results are obtained when the base-line is of considerable\r\nlength, and hence small portable range-finding instruments such as can\r\nbe easily carried and used by one man are necessarily less accurate than\r\nan arrangement such as has been suggested above, where two observers\r\nwork simultaneously from the two ends of a ship.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, however, the self-contained instrument is the only one\r\nwhich it is possible to use, and when the instrument is well made and in\r\nexperienced hands the results are surprisingly good.\r\n\r\nAs used in surveying, for example, where the base-line may be anything,\r\naccording to circumstances, and the angles may likewise vary at both\r\nends, elaborate trigonometrical calculations have to be performed to\r\narrive at the desired result. If, however, the base-line be always the\r\nsame, and one of the angles be always a right angle, the distance of the\r\ndistant object will vary with the remaining angle. Indeed the scale by\r\nwhich that angle is measured can be made to give not degrees, but the\r\ndistance of the object. Portable range-finders, therefore, in many cases\r\nhave one reflector set for a right angle and only one of the reflectors\r\nmovable. The instrument then shows the distance of the object at a\r\nglance.\r\n\r\nThis is impossible in the case of two separate observations on a ship.\r\nIn that case the base is always the same, but since the ship cannot be\r\nset at right angles to the object whenever a range has to be found, both\r\nangles have to be measured. There is, however, a beautifully simple\r\nlittle mechanism in which two pointers are set one to each of the two\r\nangles, and the distance is then shown instantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE RIFLES SHOWN AT PAGE 240\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN MAUSER can fire forty rounds a minute--more than any other\r\nrifle used in the war. The rifle is of the 1898 pattern, weighs 9 lb. 14\r\noz. with bayonet fixed, and is sighted from 219 to 2187 yards. The\r\nmagazine holds five cartridges, packed in chargers. As the rifle is not\r\nprovided with a cut-off, it cannot be used as a single-loader. With its\r\nlong barrel and long bayonet it gives a stabbing length of 5 ft. 9\r\nin.--8 in. longer than the British.\r\n\r\nTHE AUSTRIAN RIFLE is the Mannlicher. This rifle is very fast in action\r\nas a snap back and forth of the wrist is sufficient to operate it. It\r\nis, however, more trying for prolonged work, owing to the throwing of\r\nthe strain only on the wrist. Without the bayonet the rifle weighs only\r\n8 lb. 5 oz., the lightest of all, yet the bullet--244 grains--is the\r\nheaviest used by any of the belligerents. The rifle is sighted from 410\r\nto 2132 yards, and the barrel has a four-groove rifling.\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH LEE-ENFIELD--MARK III--is the outcome of the South African\r\nWar. It is not too long for horseback and is yet quite efficient for\r\ninfantry. The barrel is 25 in. long and has five grooves in the rifling.\r\nIt is sighted from 200 to 2800 yards. The rifle is fitted with a\r\nmagazine which holds ten cartridges packed in chargers, each of which\r\ncontains five rounds, so that the magazine is filled with ten rounds in\r\ntwo motions. The rifle is also fitted with a cut-off, which enables it\r\nto be used as a single-loader. It is altogether a most efficient\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH LEBEL is of the 1886-1893 pattern, and with bayonet fixed is\r\nlonger than any other rifle. It weighs, without bayonet, 9 lb. 3-1/2 oz.\r\nThe tube magazine under the barrel contains eight cartridges; it takes,\r\nof course, longer to charge than a magazine loaded with a charger. It\r\ndoes not fire as many shots a minute as some of the other rifles in the\r\nfield. The position of the magazine is indicated by the crosses. The\r\nrifle is sighted from 273 to 2187 yards, and the bullet weighs 198\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nTHE BELGIAN ARMY uses the 1889 pattern Mauser, which weighs just over 8\r\nlb. and is sighted from 547 to 2187 yards. The magazine holds five\r\ncartridges carried in clips; not having a cut-off, the rifle cannot be\r\nused as a single-loader. It has four grooves in its rifling and measures\r\n4 ft. 2-1/4 in., or, with the bayonet, 4 ft. 11-3/4 in. The bayonet is\r\nshort and flat.\r\n\r\nTHE \"3 LINE\" NAGANT of Russia is 1/4 lb. heavier than the British rifle\r\nand is over 7 in. longer. The triangular bayonet is always fixed and\r\nnever removed from the rifle. The magazine of the rifle is of the box\r\ntype and holds five cartridges. The rifle is capable of discharging\r\ntwenty-four bullets to the minute. A useful feature is the interrupter,\r\nwhich prevents jamming of two cartridges.\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN MANNLICHER-CARCANO is of the 1891 pattern. It weighs,\r\nwithout bayonet, just over 8 lb. 6 oz. and measures 50-3/4 in. The\r\nbarrel, 30-3/4 in. long, has a four-groove rifling.
