No battlefield has ever\r\nappealed to me as has that—none has come near it to me, in sentiment,\r\nexcept when I stood in the trenches of Valley Forge and saw the\r\nblizzard-swept lines where Patriotism stood in the last ditch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Looking toward the British line.]\r\n\r\nNew Orleans is easily the greatest signal victory ever won on American\r\nsoil. History shows nothing in its class except King’s Mountain.\r\nEverything else in the Civil War that we now regard as decisive was an\r\nevenly matched, mathematically planned contest, between great armies, in\r\nwhich, so far as the records go, one lost about as much as the other,\r\nwith victory at last on the banner of the side with the most troops, the\r\nmost guns, the better equipment and the best food for marching men.\r\n\r\nShiloh, Stone River, Chickamauga, in the West—Bull Run, Seven Days,\r\nAntietam, Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, in the East—these were all great\r\nsteel-sheathed locomotives rushing full speed to a head-on collision.\r\n\r\nAnd, after the collision, there was scrap-iron all around.\r\n\r\nBut New Orleans was a steel ram striking a man-of-war, and the\r\nman-of-war was not. There is only one way to explain the miracle of the\r\nunexpected—the incongruity of the Incongruous—and that is, Providence.\r\n\r\nNow, Providence had selected Jackson for this job.\r\n\r\nFive miles below the city the street car lines stop, but it is an\r\ninteresting walk to clamber up on the bermuda and melilotus-covered levee\r\nand follow the river to the Chalmette battlefield. The air is soft and\r\nwarm, the big river sweeps splendid along, the beautiful old homes on the\r\nbanks peep sleepily out from pecan and great moss-covered oaks. Far away\r\nto the southeast stretch plain and forest.\r\n\r\nNo wonder they fought for it, you say. Who would wish to die in a fairer\r\nland, under sunnier skies?\r\n\r\nThen you get a shock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The field across which the British charged.]\r\n\r\nJust at the battlefield and where the unfinished Chalmette monument\r\n(and why should it remain unfinished, O, ye of little faith save in your\r\nscrambling for dollars?) looms up there is a repulsive derrick very\r\nnearly on the spot where Jackson’s grim lines ran up to the river, and\r\nwhere the Carolina’s fiery little battery spat at the Red Coats from\r\ntheir earthworks. All around are evidences of something that smells\r\nlike Russell Sage, Rockefeller, Morgan or New York Life. It is a sugar\r\nrefinery, said to be the biggest of its kind anywhere—a trust, and hence\r\na thief by nature, and now it has butted into the battlefield, buying\r\nas it goes, and paying for the privilege of wiping sentiment out with\r\nsugar-coated pills. Its great banks already overtop the spot where\r\nJackson stood under the moss-grown oaks. Its embankments shut out the\r\nsun of New Orleans. When it gets ready it will take the rest of the\r\nbattlefield. The sight of it and its vandalism hurts, and the hurt was\r\nworse when I found that New Orleans did not care. Nay, I think from what\r\nI heard, that she was prouder of the refinery than she was of the battle;\r\nfor everybody could tell me of the refinery, and no one knew anything\r\nof the battle save a little woman who kept the cottage and grounds where\r\nthe half-completed Chalmette monument marked the spot of Jackson’s\r\nbreastworks and glorious stand. She knew that Jackson’s breastworks ran\r\ndown the row of trees at the lane, that his headquarters were right\r\nover there in that clump of old oaks, and that Pakenham was buried for\r\nsix months under that pecan tree, where some old masonry showed there\r\nhad been a grave. The rest of it I had to dig out of the library of the\r\nHistorical Society.\r\n\r\nAn old fisherwoman who stood on the levee where Jackson’s line touched\r\nthe river, and where the cotton bales were confiscated to help form the\r\nfirst line of breastworks, in answer to my question, told me, after\r\nexpectorating a large quantity of snuffy fluid into the river, that she\r\n“had heurn of a right peart fight bein’ fit hereabouts when my mammy was\r\na baby—but jes’ whur I can’t say.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “That Jackson’s headquarters were right over there in that\r\nclump of oaks.” The trees alone were there, this house having been built\r\nafter the original one was burned.]\r\n\r\nIn his “Naval War of 1812,” Theodore Roosevelt thus graphically describes\r\nthe place as he thought it was then: “Amid the gloomy semi-tropical\r\nswamps that covered the quaking delta thrust out into the blue waters of\r\nthe Mexican Gulf by the strong torrent of the mighty Mississippi, stood\r\nthe fair French city of New Orleans. Its lot had been strange and varied.\r\nWon, and lost once and again, in conflict with the subjects of the\r\nCatholic king, there was a strong Spanish tinge in the French blood that\r\ncoursed so freely through the veins of its citizens; joined by purchase\r\nto the great Federal Republic, it yet shared no feeling with the latter\r\nsave that of hatred to the common foe. And now an hour of sore need had\r\ncome upon the city, for against it came the red English, lords of fight\r\nby land and sea. A great fleet of war vessels—ships of the line, frigates\r\nand sloops—under Admiral Cochrane, was on the way to New Orleans,\r\nconvoying a still larger fleet of troop ships, with aboard them some ten\r\nthousand fighting men, chiefly the fierce and hearty veterans of the\r\nPeninsular War, who had been trained for seven years in the stern school\r\nof the Iron Duke, and who were now led by one of the bravest and ablest\r\nof all Wellington’s brave and able lieutenants, Sir Edward Pakenham.”\r\n\r\nWhen the President wrote that he was young and undecided whether he\r\nwould hunt grizzlies or write poetry, I, for one, am glad he hunted the\r\ngrizzly. Imagine any man standing on the melilotus-covered levees of the\r\nFather of Rivers and tracing from horizon to horizon the faint penciling\r\nof a sky so blue that it flushes at times into purple, corralling in\r\nthe compass of its circle, now an old mansion, pecan-shadowed and\r\nwisteria-crowned, now a meadow, cattle-dotted and sheened with little\r\nlakes, now groves of oak and ash, moss swept with hoariness, now fields\r\nbeyond, broad in their Southern fullness, big in benisons of eternal\r\nsummer—imagine this true picture, and then hearing from the Far North\r\nthe sepulchral croak of a sophomoric bullfrog: “Amid the g-l-o-omy\r\nsemi-tropical s-w-a-a-mps that covered the q-u-a-king delta!”\r\n\r\nI failed to see the gloomy swamps, and the only things that ever quaked\r\nthere were the bull-bellied British, marching nearly a century ago for\r\nthe lust and plunder on this fair Creole city, utterly unconscious that\r\nany foe worthy of their steel and stomachs stood before them, until\r\nsuddenly out of the sunset and shadows of the memorable day of the\r\nevening of their landing Jackson’s grim Indian fighters fell on them in\r\nthe darkness and fought them to a finish, as they fought all beasts, at\r\nclose quarters, with clubbed guns and bear-knives.\r\n\r\nThat was the night of December 23d, 1814, the beginning of the battle of\r\nNew Orleans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old breastworks, primrose-covered.]\r\n\r\nLet us briefly go back and bring events from our last paper—Jackson in\r\nthe wilderness of Alabama, victor of an Indian war, remover of the strong\r\nallies of the Spaniard and British—the red, menacing, butchering wedge\r\nthat was thrust in between the two parts of the young Republic. It really\r\ndeserves a chapter itself, and that chapter might well be headed, “What\r\nJackson Did to the Spanish.” Briefly, it is this:\r\n\r\nJackson, having finished the Indian War, marched, May, 1814, homeward,\r\namid the plaudits of the pioneer West, disbanding his army at\r\nFayetteville, Tennessee, and receiving an ovation and banquet in\r\nNashville. He is appointed by the President Major General in the United\r\nStates Army, and later, by his influence and the great fear and respect\r\nthe Indians had for him, he closed a treaty with them at Fort Jackson,\r\nand the Southern territory to Florida (which belonged to Spain), became\r\nthe Republic’s. And now, Jackson was free to turn on the treacherous and\r\ndouble-dealing Spaniard, who had secretly helped Britain in the Indian\r\nWar, and, even then, contrary to her sworn neutrality, was housing and\r\nfeeding British troops at Pensacola and other portions of her territory,\r\nand permitting them, five thousand strong, to rendezvous in Pensacola\r\npreparing for the expedition which they knew was already on the high seas\r\nbound for New Orleans.\r\n\r\nAs stated in our last paper, these were the darkest days of the Republic.\r\nOnly Jackson could have saved it. He alone was the cog that fitted\r\nsquarely into the wheel of things.\r\n\r\nJackson struck squarely out from the shoulder at the Spanish. He violated\r\nour treaty with Spain openly when he marched on Pensacola, for to his\r\nstraight soul he saw more honor in doing a thing openly and aboveboard\r\nthan in doing it treacherously and slyly, as Spain had done all along.\r\nIf he had not whipped the British at New Orleans, we would have had a\r\nwar with Spain on our hands. He had to act quickly. The British had come\r\nand were coming faster. By August, 1814, the sleepy town of Pensacola\r\nhad awakened to new life—and the life was red—red English. Eight or ten\r\nEnglish battleships lay in her harbor; regiments of negro soldiers from\r\nthe West Indies went ashore, with other British, soldiers, all drilling\r\ndaily. The English were repairing the forts, and their commander and the\r\nSpanish governor slept under the same roof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Its great banks already overtop the spot where Jackson\r\nstood.”]\r\n\r\nThere were rumors of a great force coming, but no one knew where it would\r\nstrike. Jackson learned it first from the Pirate Jean La Fitte, and that\r\npirate’s story and the gallant fight his crew made handling a battery of\r\nguns at New Orleans is a story in itself.\r\n\r\nJackson decided to act. He wrote to the Secretary of War, “If the\r\nhostile Creeks have taken refuge in Florida and are there fed, clothed\r\nand protected; if the British have landed a large force, munitions of\r\nwar and are fortifying, and stirring up the savages, will you not say\r\nto me, raise a few hundred militia, which may be quickly done, and with\r\nsuch regular force as can be conveniently collected make a descent upon\r\nPensacola and reduce it? If so, I promise you the war in the South shall\r\nhave speedy termination, and English influence be forever destroyed with\r\nthe savages in this quarter.”\r\n\r\nJackson received an answer six months later, full of sound and meaning\r\nnothing, or, if anything, that he mustn’t do it. In the meanwhile he had\r\ndone it, for the British became bolder, threw off all restraint, and\r\nprepared to sally from the neutral port of Pensacola to take Mobile.\r\nJackson sent back to Tennessee through the wilderness for his old\r\nfighters. And they came, so eager to fight again under their idolized\r\nleader that many paid as high as eighty dollars for the privilege of\r\nbeing substituted for those who could not go. Jackson wrote again and\r\nagain to the Secretary of War, imploring him, lecturing him: “How\r\nlong will the United States pocket the reproach and open insults of\r\nSpain?... Temporizing policy is not only a disgrace but an insult to any\r\nnation.... If permission had been given me to march against this place\r\ntwenty days ago I would ere this have planted the American eagle; now we\r\nmust trust alone to our valor and the justice of our cause.” And after\r\na long series of correspondence with the two-faced Spanish governor,\r\nJackson ended his talk with him: “In future I beg you to withhold your\r\ninsulting charges against my Government for one more inclined to listen\r\nto your slander than I am; nor consider me any more as a diplomatic\r\ncharacter, unless so proclaimed to you from the mouth of my cannon.”\r\n\r\nIt was now in early fall. The Tennesseans under Coffee and Carroll were\r\npouring down South to him, past the old battlefields of the Creeks, now\r\nan open road to Mobile and New Orleans.\r\n\r\nBefore they arrived he had strengthened Mobile, and the immortal Lawrence\r\nhad fought them off from Fort Bowyer, killing 162, wounding the vaunting\r\nColonel Nichols himself, and sending them crestfallen back to Pensacola.\r\n\r\nThen, from La Fitte, whom the British had attempted to bribe, he first\r\nknew that New Orleans would be attacked, and he waited no longer. He\r\nmarched on Pensacola and took it, and the English fleet and army vanished\r\nat the first thunder of his guns.\r\n\r\nBut where? To New Orleans, where their great fleet on the high seas was\r\nnow headed—a fleet with a convoy of ten thousand fighting British. And\r\nCoffee and his Tennesseans still in the wilderness!\r\n\r\nNovember 25th, 1814. Good news! Coffee and his Tennesseans are at Mobile.\r\nBut that is not New Orleans, and a hundred miles of wilderness lie\r\nbetween.\r\n\r\nJackson reached New Orleans December 2d. I hesitate to try to picture\r\nhim as he appeared to the gay, well fed, well bred people of that Creole\r\ntown. Chronic dysentery since two years before, terrible in its pains and\r\ngriping on his nerves and temper.\r\n\r\nIn the Howard Library, New Orleans, the librarian of which is William\r\nBeers, undoubtedly the best living authority of Jacksonia, and a scholar\r\nand natural-born bibliophile, I was shown many courtesies and gathered\r\nsome most interesting facts. Mr. Beers ranks Judge Walker’s book first\r\non Jackson, because he was an accurate, scholarly historian, who got\r\nhis information first-hand from survivors of the great battle who lived\r\nwith him in his native city. “Parton’s book was not even secondary, but\r\ntertiary,” said Mr. Beers. “He took freely from Walker and gave but scant\r\ncredit.” Here is Judge Walker’s description of Jackson’s arrival in New\r\nOrleans, written while many eye-witnesses were living, in 1855:\r\n\r\n“Along the road leading from Ft. St. John to the city, early in the\r\nmorning of December 2d, 1814, a party of gentlemen rode at a brisk\r\ntrot from the lake towards the city. The mist which during the night\r\nbroods over the city had not cleared off. The air was chilly, damp,\r\nuncomfortable. The travelers, however, were hardy men, accustomed\r\nto exposure and intent upon purposes too absorbing to leave any\r\nconsciousness of external discomfort. The chief of the party, which\r\nwas composed of five or six persons, was a tall, gaunt man, of very\r\nerect carriage, with a countenance full of stern decision and fearless\r\nenergy, but furrowed with care and anxiety. His complexion was sallow and\r\nunhealthy; his hair was iron gray, and his body thin and emaciated, as\r\nof one just recovered from a lingering sickness. But the fierce glare of\r\nhis bright and hawk-like eye betrayed a soul and spirit which triumphed\r\nover all the infirmities of the body. His dress was simple and nearly\r\nthreadbare. A small leather cap protected his head, and a short Spanish\r\nblue cloak his body, whilst his feet and legs were encased in high\r\ndragoon boots, long ignorant of polish or blacking, which reached to his\r\nknees. In age he appeared to have passed about forty-five winters—the\r\nseason for which his stern and hardy nature seemed peculiarly adapted.”\r\n\r\nOne of the strange things about the lives of all great men is the\r\nalmost certain fact that some grossly untrue story, picturesque lie or\r\nexaggerated half-truth of some personal trait will be started and cling\r\nto them for all time.\r\n\r\nFor a half-bred lie always outruns a full-blood truth.\r\n\r\nThe universally accepted misrepresentation of Jackson’s character is that\r\nhe was an uncouth backwoodsman, half-spelled, ill-bred and a bragging\r\nbully.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “The beautiful old homes on the banks peeped sleepily from\r\npecan and oaks.”]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact there never lived a man of greater natural dignity,\r\nof finer manners or more courtly grace when he wished than Andrew\r\nJackson, in spite of his violent outbursts of passion at times. In 1858,\r\none of the finest old ladies of New Orleans told this story to James\r\nParton:\r\n\r\nThe new aide-de-camp, Mr. Livingston, as he rode from the parade ground\r\nby the General’s side, invited him home to dinner. The General promptly\r\naccepted the invitation. It chanced that the beautiful and gay Mrs.\r\nLivingston, the leader of society then at New Orleans, both Creole and\r\nAmerican, had a little dinner party that day, composed only of ladies,\r\nmost of whom were young and lively Creole belles. Livingston had sent\r\nhome word that General Jackson had arrived, and that he should ask\r\nhim to dinner, a piece of news that threw the hospitable lady into\r\nconsternation. “What shall we do with this wild General from Tennessee?”\r\nwhispered the girls to one another, for they had all conceived that\r\nGeneral Jackson, however becoming he might comport himself in an Indian\r\nfight, would be most distressingly out of place at a fashionable dinner\r\nparty in the first drawing-room of the most polite city in America.\r\nHe was announced. The young ladies were seated about the room. Mrs.\r\nLivingston sat upon a sofa at the head of the apartment, anxiously\r\nawaiting the inroad of the wild fighter into the regions sacred hitherto\r\nto elegance and grace. He entered, erect, composed, bronzed with long\r\nexposure to the sun, his hair just beginning to turn gray, clad in his\r\nuniform of coarse blue cloth and yellow buckskin, his high boots flapping\r\nloosely about his slender legs, he looked the very picture of a war-worn\r\nnoble commander. He bowed to the ladies magnificently, who all arose at\r\nhis entrance as much in amazement as politeness. Mrs. Livingston advanced\r\nto meet him. With a dignity and grace seldom equaled, never surpassed,\r\nhe went forward to meet her, conducted her back to the sofa and sat by\r\nher side. The fair Creoles were dumb with astonishment. In a few minutes\r\ndinner was served and the General continued during the progress of the\r\nmeal to converse in an easy, agreeable manner, in the tone of society,\r\nof the sole topic of the time—the coming invasion. He assured the ladies\r\nthat he felt perfectly confident of defending the city, and begged that\r\nthey would give themselves no uneasiness in regard to it. He arose soon\r\nand left the table with Mr. Livingston. In one chorus the young ladies\r\nexclaimed: “Is this your backwoodsman? Why, madam, he is a prince.”\r\n\r\nJackson had indeed arrived, but never did a defender find so helpless and\r\nutterly unprepared a city. The city was a bickering, divided thing, not a\r\nfortification, not a battery mounted, not an idea even, and scarcely any\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nAnd scared stiff.\r\n\r\nJackson was both law and idea, and in twenty-four hours, by his own calm\r\nand intrepid bravery, his own self-assurance and fiery determination, he\r\nhad the impulsive inhabitants ready to fight to the death.\r\n\r\nOn December 8, 1814, just one month to a day before the great battle\r\nwas fought, a splendid double-deck battleship, the Tornant, flying the\r\nBritish admiral’s flag, and the advance guard of the great host, anchored\r\noff Chandeleur’s Island. There were two ways to reach New Orleans—up\r\nthe Mississippi, or in the open bay through Lake Borgne, thence a march\r\nacross the level delta straight to the city.\r\n\r\nThe English chose the latter. Five little American gunboats with 180\r\nmen lay in Lake Borgne, and these put up a gallant fight against the\r\nforty-five barges and one thousand men who finally grappled with them and\r\ntook them with cutlass, pike and pistols.\r\n\r\nAnd there, at noon, December 23, 1814, on the banks of the Bayou\r\nBienvenue, a lonely, marshy place, and the last place that Jackson\r\nthought they would land, the British, 1,900 strong, under General Keane,\r\none of the ablest officers of the command, landed without opposition and\r\neven without the knowledge of Jackson, who was beyond the city, near Lake\r\nPontchartrain, expecting them there. In two hours he had four hundred\r\nmore troops, a force larger that day than Jackson’s entire available\r\ncommand, and in nine miles of New Orleans, on a dead level plain, bounded\r\non one side by the river and the other by the marshes of the lake.\r\n\r\nIt was a plain, easy march to New Orleans, and if he had marched at it\r\nthat afternoon it would have been his before night. And why did he not?\r\nFor only one reason—neither Pakenham nor Keane nor any general or soldier\r\nof all the British army supposed for an instant that there was anything\r\nbefore them but a lot of cowardly backwoodsmen whom they could brush away\r\nwith their bayonets or stampede with a single charge.\r\n\r\nAnd who, indeed, were these men? Who was their commander, and what\r\nhad they done on battlefield before? Speaking of Pakenham’s utter\r\ndefeat of the French Field Marshal Soult, but a short time before, the\r\nEnglish historian, Napier, says: “He was opposed to one of the greatest\r\ngenerals in the world, at the head of unconquerable troops. For what\r\nAlexander’s Macedonians were at Arbela, Hannibal’s Africans at Cannae,\r\nCaesar’s Romans at Pharsalia, Napoleon’s Guards at Austerlitz—such\r\nwere Wellington’s British soldiers at this period.... Six years of\r\nuninterrupted success had engrafted in their natural strength and\r\nfierceness a confidence that made them invincible.”\r\n\r\nAnd here is the same author’s description of how Pakenham fell on\r\nSalamanca, routing the best soldiers of continental Europe:\r\n\r\n“It was five o’clock when Pakenham fell on Thomieres.... From the chief\r\nto the lowest soldier, all of the French felt that they were lost, and\r\nin an instant Pakenham, the most frank and gallant of men, commenced the\r\nbattle. The British columns formed lines as they marched, and the French\r\ngunners, standing up manfully for their country, sent showers of grape\r\ninto the advancing masses, while a crowd of light troops poured in a fire\r\nof musketry, under cover of which the main body endeavored to display\r\na front. But bearing onward through the skirmishes, with the weight of\r\na giant, Pakenham broke the half-formed lines into fragments and sent\r\nthe whole in confusion upon the advancing support, spreading terror and\r\ndisorder upon the enemy’s left.”\r\n\r\nPakenham, and the army under him at New Orleans, were the pick of\r\nWellington’s troops, who had driven Bonaparte’s greatest general across\r\nthe Pyrenees. They had conquered at Rodrigo, Badajos, San Sebastian,\r\nToulouse, Salamanca. They laughed at raw backwoods militia, with not\r\neven a bayonet to their long, uncouth rifles. And what were they in\r\nvictory? Was there any real ground for fear that they would carry out\r\ntheir threats of Beauty and Booty in New Orleans? When Jackson rode along\r\nin the afternoon of December 23 to the front to meet the British, women\r\nand children surrounded him in consternation. “Say to them,” he said to\r\nLivingston, “that no British soldier shall enter the city unless over my\r\ndead body. I will smash them, so help me God!”\r\n\r\nBut that night many of the women of New Orleans slept with small daggers\r\nin their bosoms. And well may the handsome Creole women of New Orleans\r\nhave been afraid. Badajos, San Sebastian, Toulouse, all were friendly\r\ntowns, only the garrisons being hostile to the English. And yet, General\r\nNapier, who was an eye witness to what he describes, tells how these same\r\nsoldiers did at Badajos:\r\n\r\nJackson reached New Orleans December 2d, as stated, more fit for the\r\nhospital than the camp, and with only three weeks in which (as it proved)\r\nto prepare the defenseless city. But under the magic of that strange,\r\npositive, fiery man, the quick tempers of the impulsive inhabitants\r\nwere welded to the white heat of desperate determination. And what a\r\nmotley lot of defenders he found—About 800 new troops, regulars, raw and\r\nundrilled; Planches’ City Battalion, five hundred; two regiments of State\r\nmilitia, armed with fowling pieces, muskets, old rifles; a regiment of\r\nfree negroes, or, as Jackson called them, “free men of colour,” and right\r\nwell did they quit themselves in the fight—in all, about 2,000 men. Two\r\nlittle men-of-war-armed schooners, the Carolina and the Louisiana, lay in\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nBut Coffee and his Tennesseans were coming from Pensacola through the\r\nwoods, and Jackson sent courier after courier to them, saying: “Don’t\r\nsleep till you reach me or arrive in striking distance.” Carroll, with\r\nother Tennessee and Kentucky troops, had floated down the Cumberland, the\r\nOhio, and were now on the Mississippi. But he had only one gun to ten\r\nmen until he overtook a boatload of muskets, and with these he drilled\r\nhis men on the decks of his boat. To him Jackson sent a steamboat up the\r\nriver with this message: “I am resolved, feeble as my force is, to await\r\nthe enemy on his first landing, and perish sooner than he shall reach the\r\ncity.”\r\n\r\nTwo thousand Kentuckians under Generals Thomas and Adair were also\r\nfloating down the Mississippi, a ragged, defenseless and almost gunless\r\ncrowd, without blanket or tents, and only one cooking kettle to every\r\neighty men. And now it was the 14th day of December, and the British had\r\nbeen at the mouth of the river nearly a week.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 17th Coffee, one hundred and twenty-nine miles from\r\nNew Orleans, received Jackson’s note. His horses were poor, three hundred\r\nof his men sick, but in three days he was there; but only with his picked\r\nmen—800—all that could follow so rapid a march. Here is a description of\r\nthem: “Their appearance was not very military. In their woolen hunting\r\nshirts of dark or dingy color and coperas-dyed pantaloons, made, both\r\ncloth and garments, at home, by their wives, mothers and sisters; with\r\nslouching wool hats, some composed of the skins of raccoons and foxes,\r\nwith belts of untanned deerskins, in which were stuck hunting knives and\r\ntomahawks, hair long and unkempt, and faces unshorn.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Paying for the privilege of wiping sentiment out.” The\r\nRefinery’s work. The trees on the left were Jackson’s headquarters. The\r\nhalf-completed monument shows in the center of the picture.]\r\n\r\nOf their leader, Jackson, Roosevelt says, in his “Naval War of 1812:”\r\n\r\n“Yet, although a mighty and cruel foe was at their very gates, nothing\r\nsave fierce defiance reigned in the fiery Creole hearts of the Crescent\r\nCity. For a master spirit was in their midst. Andrew Jackson, having\r\nutterly broken and destroyed the most powerful Indian confederacy that\r\nhad ever menaced the Southwest, and having driven the haughty Spaniard\r\nfrom Pensacola, was now bending all the energies of his rugged intellect\r\nand indomitable will to the one object of defending New Orleans. No man\r\ncould have been better fitted for the task. He had hereditary wrongs to\r\navenge on the British, and he hated them with an implacable fury that\r\nwas absolutely devoid of fear. Born and brought up among the lawless\r\ncharacters of the frontier, and knowing well how to deal with them, he\r\nwas able to establish and preserve the strictest martial law in the city\r\nwithout in the least quelling the spirit of the citizens. To a restless\r\nand untiring energy he united sleepless vigilance and genuine military\r\ngenius. Prompt to attack whenever the chance offered itself, seizing with\r\nready grasp the slightest vantage point, and never giving up a foot of\r\nearth that he could keep, he yet had the patience to play a defender’s\r\ngame when it suited him, and with consummate skill he always followed out\r\nthe scheme of warfare that was best adapted to his wild soldiery.”\r\n\r\nIt was two o’clock, December 23, before Jackson learned that Keane, with\r\n2,300 men, had landed and marched to the river’s bank, in six miles of\r\nNew Orleans. Without a moment’s hesitation he drew up his thin, sallow\r\nform, struck his clenched fist on a table and said: “By the eternal, they\r\nshall not sleep on our soil!”\r\n\r\nVery quietly, later, he ate a little rice and dozed on a sofa—the only\r\nsleep he had, say several reputable historians, for four days and nights\r\nthereafter, and he started to meet the enemy with a little over two\r\nthousand men.\r\n\r\nI am willing to stake my claim, previously made, that this man was one\r\nof the greatest military geniuses of the first century of the Republic\r\non this one act alone. Here were the British, more than a match for him\r\nin numbers, equipment and confidence. So sure were they of taking the\r\ncity that they had loafed along all afternoon and now had gone in a jolly\r\ncamp at sunset, on the banks of the great river, preferring to march into\r\nthe city in the morning, and not at night. They were disciplined and\r\nbayonetted, jolly as a lot of schoolboys, and brave as men get to be,\r\nfull of fun and fight. I cannot think of another general, from Washington\r\nto Lee, from Gates to Grant, who would not have said: “I will fight them\r\nin the morning; this evening I will prepare. I will barricade, I will\r\nentrench, I will throw up my wall between them and the city.”\r\n\r\nAnd this would have been fatal. In broad daylight Keane would have\r\nwhipped them. He would have whipped Jackson’s troops that night but for\r\nthe darkness, but for the darkness and the grizzled, homespun clothed\r\nmen, who had cat-eyes for night fighting, who had stalked deer and\r\npanther and Indians in the shadows of it, who could steal in and steal\r\nout and use their knives in close places.\r\n\r\nThis was December 23, but that night he won the greater battle of January\r\n8.\r\n\r\nHe fell on them like a panther from the darkness of the swamp.\r\n\r\nHe gave them a jolt that Soult, nor Ney, nor Napoleon had ever given. He\r\ntaught them a warfare they had never dreamed of before. He took the sand\r\nout of their craws and the conceit out of their boasting mouths.\r\n\r\nWhen he finished with them, at midnight, they decided they had gone far\r\nenough toward New Orleans for that day, and several others. They threw up\r\nentrenchments and waited for more troops.\r\n\r\nThey were hacked, demoralized, beaten!\r\n\r\nAnd this is the way that Jackson did it. For my part I think it a far\r\nprettier fight than he made two weeks later, when he finished the blow.\r\n\r\nJackson put his troops in motion about three o’clock, amid alarm guns and\r\nbeating of drums. But he himself galloped to the river bank and signalled\r\nto the little Carolina to drop down. Then he put spurs to his horse and\r\ngalloped after the dust cloud going down the road to the Rodriguez Canal.\r\nI could see it all so plainly as I stood on the banks of the river and\r\nsaw the same landscape before me. The lean, sallow, booted man, his long\r\nlegs dangling underneath his horse’s belly, galloping seemingly to\r\ndefeat. This man of destiny, this man who believed in himself, this man\r\nwho knew that God Almighty had sent him to whip the British, just as he\r\nknew he would kill Dickinson.\r\n\r\nAnd the troops went down so merrily to death in that cloud of dust—what\r\npathos, what patriotism, what sublime ignorance of what they were up\r\nagainst, what blind faith in Jackson and God went forth that day to fight\r\nthe conquering, red English, who knew no such word as defeat, no such\r\ntactics as retreat. Marines, raw troops who hardly knew how to drill, and\r\none little battery, in all, 884; flashy Creoles, gaudily equipped and\r\nmaking much noise, the battalion of St. Domingo, “men of color,” 210;\r\nChoctaw Indians, 18; Coffee’s Tennessee Volunteers, mounted riflemen,\r\n563; Beall’s Orleans Rifle Company, 62; Mississippi Dragoons, 107, in all\r\n2,131.\r\n\r\nAnd this crowd were going to drive the victors of Toulouse, San\r\nSebastian, Salamanca and Badajos into the river, and do it at night, and\r\nnot a hundred bayonets on their guns and only two little six-pound cannon!\r\n\r\nIt was six o’clock and the British were having a jolly good time, with\r\ncampfires burning merrily and abundance of supper for hungry, healthy\r\nstomachs. And now it is seven o’clock and suddenly a little gunboat\r\nlooms out in the twilight of the river before them, a queer looking\r\nlittle craft to them, and they crowd up on the bank to look at it. It\r\ncame steadily on, its guns trained on the crowd of soldiers on the bank,\r\nwho were laughing, jollying and bantering it with empty jokes. “Can it\r\nshoot?” “What is it?” “Give it a few from a musket,” are the shouts, and\r\nthey fired on the little Carolina with muskets and out of the gathering\r\ndarkness came:\r\n\r\n“Now, boys, for the honor of America. Give it to them” And, to their\r\nconsternation, there was poured into the joking crowd a regular hell of\r\ngrape and shell, driving the British pell-mell to camp and arms and the\r\nlevee banks.\r\n\r\nJackson had reached the Bayou Bienvenu about four o’clock and formed\r\nhis thin lines as far across the plain as he could, to flank the\r\nenemy. Notices were stuck up everywhere, signed “Keane and Cochrane:”\r\n“Louisianans, remain quietly in your homes; your slaves will be preserved\r\nto you and your property respected. We make war against Americans!”\r\n\r\nThe Carolina floats down to the river opposite Jackson. He sends an\r\naide aboard and gives her commander his orders to drop down and open on\r\nthe British camp. It was an hour before the waiting Jackson heard her\r\nguns two miles below, and then he advanced, Coffee, regulars, marines,\r\nIndians, negroes, artillery, forward, with blazing guns and American\r\nyells and the British caught a circle of fire.\r\n\r\nNo man can paint that battle in the dark, for no man ever saw such a\r\nfight in the dark before. The English fought nobly, but Jackson went\r\nright in on them, his men using their knives and rifle butts, and in the\r\nmix-up they knew not front from rear, nor friend from foe. Powder smoke\r\nsettled, gray and sulphurous over the plain, half dimming an already\r\ncloud-dimmed moon. The fog added to it, and out of it, on the river,\r\nthundered the guns of the Carolina pouring shot into their ranks, and\r\nbefore them the sheeted fire of Jackson’s battery, up the levee, poured\r\nit in from the front. They fought by companies, battalions, squads.\r\nThey charged around in the darkness and under clouds of smoke and fog,\r\nand heard strange backwoods yells and ungodly oaths, and felt strange\r\nbear-knives rip into their vitals from out of the dark. They fell back,\r\nfighting, to the river bank, to the camp of trees. They charged and drove\r\nthe Tennesseans time and again before the naked, cold bayonet, but each\r\ntime they came back before clubbed guns and tomahawk and bear-knife. It\r\nwas a riot, not a battle; a butchery, not a fight; a stabbing contest\r\nin the dark, where the bear killers and Indian fighters had all the\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nAt midnight Jackson collected his men, fell back to the canal and began\r\nthere to throw up the long line of entrenchments over which the vaunted\r\nBritish battalions never put their foot.\r\n\r\nKeane was stopped, shocked, chagrined; his troops dumbfounded. Three\r\nhundred and three lay dead or wounded in the field, and sixty-four had\r\nrun off or been captured.\r\n\r\nAnd now before them, entrenched, lay the same intrepid backwoodsman who\r\nhad violated all the rules of warfare in fighting them hand-to-hand in\r\nthe night, when, if he had waited a few more hours, the city had been\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nThey had gone far enough. They would entrench and await Pakenham and the\r\nten thousand embarking troops. They would take the city later.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Shakespeare did not write his plays to live, but to make a living._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_There is no greater coward than he who despairs._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Master Hand for Marryin’\r\n\r\nBY FLORENCE L. TUCKER\r\n\r\n\r\n    (NOTE.—A real story and a touch of real mountain life.—Ed.)\r\n\r\nA young girl on a bare-backed mule rode up in front of a cabin at the\r\nfoot of a hill in the Tennessee mountains. Slowly she surveyed the\r\npremises; beside the open door hung a gun and a powder horn and a string\r\nof red peppers; to the left, rearing itself against the hot afternoon\r\nsky, stood a gaunt martin pole, and around the corner of the house,\r\ninquisitive, but not unfriendly, advanced a lean, spotted hound.\r\n\r\n“Hullo,” she called in a quiet voice.\r\n\r\nFrom inside a pair of steel-rimmed spectacles was shined upon her, and\r\nthe heads of two half-grown girls peered out.\r\n\r\n“Ther’s somebody at the gate, thar, Gabe,” said the woman.\r\n\r\nBut the man had already taken in the figure in the pink calico frock and\r\nfaded sunbonnet and was regarding it with a stealthy, sidewise glance\r\nfrom under his flop hat. Deliberately he rose, and was followed by the\r\nwoman and the two girls.\r\n\r\n“It’s Whit Bozeman’s Luce, from over t’other side the mountain,” he said,\r\nhalting in the doorway. Then to the girl waiting at the gate: “Hullo.”\r\n\r\nBut the woman went out. “’Light an’ come in,” she said, advancing with\r\nsome show of interest.\r\n\r\n“No, I ain’t hardly got time,” responded the girl. “Ole Gran’pap Bozeman\r\nis be’n tuk pow’rful bad with the mizry in his side, and I rid over to\r\nsee ef I could git a black chickin. I come acrost to Weems, but nobody\r\nwasn’t to home, an’ I come on down here. I ’lowed I didn’t know none o’\r\nyou-all, but I’d hearn tell yer was mighty feelin fer folks in trouble,\r\nso I’d resk it.”\r\n\r\n“I seen yer at the meetin’ over at Big Valley,” said Gabe from his\r\nstation in the door.\r\n\r\n“A black chickin? Co’se yer kin hev the blackest one we’ve got. Chicken\r\ngizzard tea is mighty good fer the mizry in the side. My ole aunt used\r\nto keep ’em dried and ready. Ever’ time she’d kill a black chickin she’d\r\nsave the gizzard an’ jes’ string it up ’gainst the time when some o’ the\r\nfolks or the neighbors would be tuck down. She wuz a master han’ fer\r\nchicken gizzard tea. But git down an’ come in; settin’ in a cheer is jes’\r\nas easy as on the back o’ that thar critter.\r\n\r\n“Gabe, ketch that long shanked young rooster I be’n er-saving—the one\r\nwith feathers on his legs. G’long, chillun an’ he’p yer pap run that\r\nchicken down! An’ don’t yer be long about it, fer the sun’ll be gittin’\r\nlow afore she gits back over t’other side the mountain.”\r\n\r\nLuce sprank lightly to the ground and the two seated themselves on the\r\nrude wooden bench upon the porch. As the girl removed her bonnet her\r\nreddish hair clung in a mass of shining wave about her neck, the warmth\r\nof the summer sun was in her cheek, and stood in a delicate moisture\r\nabove her full lip. The elder woman settled her glasses and regarded her.\r\n\r\n“Law, yes,” she said. “I had gizzards saved up sence ’way back ’fore\r\nChris’mus two year ago, but Gabe’s las wife wuz sick quite a spell—she\r\njes died this spring—and the gizzards jes’ did hold out. She mighty\r\nnigh lived on chicken gizzard tea toward the las’. I give it ter all\r\no’ his wives. Gabe’s be’n married moren’t onct or twict,” she said\r\nexplanatorily; “he don’t have no luck with his wives. The fust one died\r\nin no time, an’ the next one didn’t live so very long—she wuz the mother\r\no’ these two chillun; the las’ one never had none. Gabe’s a master han’\r\nfer marryin’.”\r\n\r\nJust then Gabe and the two girls and the dog, in wild pursuit of the long\r\nshanked rooster, the feathered legs well in the lead, rushed pell-mell\r\naround the house.\r\n\r\n“What’s them girls’ names?” asked Luce.\r\n\r\n“Liz an’ Bet,” replied their grandmother. “The’r ma wuz name’ Lizabet’,\r\nan’ when the twins wuz born I sez: ‘Well, ef it had er be’n jes’ one\r\nwe’d er called it Liz, an’ sence it’s two we’ll call ’em Liz an’ Bet.’\r\nAn’ so ’twuz. They’ll be fourteen year ole three days afore this comin’\r\nFourth o’ July. I ain’t never fergot, kase I didn’t want ’em ever axed no\r\nquestions about the’r age thet they couldn’t answer. I ain’t ever knowed\r\njes’ how ole I wuz, an’ sometimes I kinder wisht I did. My ole man, he\r\nused ter figger on it, but I never could feel no ways certain. I wuz\r\nmarried when I wuz fifteen, an’ from then on I kep’ ercount o’ things\r\njes’ in my head. Like them hats in thar tells me how many year I be’n er\r\nlivin’ on this mountain.”\r\n\r\nShe motioned her hand toward the open door, and Luce shifted her position\r\nto get a better view of a string of wool hats swung across from one joist\r\nto the other.\r\n\r\n“Yer see, thar’s eleven of ’em. The ole man, he bought a new one ever’\r\ntwo year—that would make twenty-two; an’ he’s be’n dead two year, which\r\nmakes twenty-four sence me an’ him moved into this yere house. I never\r\ncould bear to see nothin wasted, so ever’ time he quit wearin’ one I jes’\r\nstrung it up thar on the j’ist, an’ sence he’s be’n gone I ain’t never\r\nhad the heart to take ’em down.”\r\n\r\nA great flapping of wings and squawking under the lean-to at the rear of\r\nthe house announcing that the remedy for Gran’pap Bozeman’s “mizry” was\r\nin hand, if not in sight, Luce, conscious of the press of time, rose to\r\nbe ready to receive it. Gabe came round holding the feathered legs in one\r\nhand and a strip of old cloth in the other. As he saw the girl’s look\r\nfull upon him, he straightened himself and quickened his gait.\r\n\r\n“They do say,” said old Mrs. Freeler, “that a green gizzard ain’t nigh\r\nthe good that a dry one is. Ef I kin git holt o’ ary other black chicken\r\nI’ll save it and dry it out fer yer.”\r\n\r\n“I’m mighty glad I come on down here,” said Luce, as she mounted from\r\nthe rail fence. “I couldn’t er gone back without that chicken. Gran’pap\r\nBozeman’s pow’rful bad.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be over that er way Sunday,” said Gabe in a low voice, as he handed\r\nup the firmly tied legs, “an’ll stop by ter see how the ole man comes on.”\r\n\r\n“Ther’s preachin’” replied the girl, a little red coming into her cheek.\r\nAnd when mule and rider had vanished behind the thick wood he took down\r\nhis gun called to the dog and followed slowly the way she had gone.\r\n\r\nSunday, betimes he had ridden away on the old gray mare.\r\n\r\n“Yer pap mus’ be goin’ over ter Big Valley ergin,” said Mrs. Freeler to\r\nthe girls. “Ther’s a preachin’ over thar onct a month this summer. But\r\nhe never said nothin’ erbout it. Curious, too; he inginerally does leave\r\nsome idee o’ whar he’s goin’.”\r\n\r\n“I heern ’im tell Dick Weems he seen a mighty fine lookin’ girl over thar\r\nlas’ meetin’-day,” said Bet.\r\n\r\n“Mebbe pap’s courtin’ ergin,” commented Liz.\r\n\r\nAnd when, four weeks from that day he again rode off without having let\r\nfall any hint of his destination, the suspicion was confirmed. Mrs.\r\nFreeler had come to know the signs; she grew restless and watched Gabe\r\nfurtively every time he left the house, and when he came into it. His\r\ntall, lank form was less indoors than ever, and he grew more silent and\r\nmoody, riding away oftener over the mountain. Always a shiftless fellow,\r\nhe appeared more so now, except at times, when, in spurts of industry, he\r\nworked off his newly-awakened energy. But not so with Mrs. Freeler. The\r\nmore her son idled, the faster her fingers flew. “I wuz allus a master\r\nhan’ at patchin’,” she said, as she turned over and over the garments of\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\nAs the haying season came on Gabe became possessed of an unusual fit\r\nof application. He had worked steadily for three days when something\r\nhappened. Driving up with a load of hay piled rather higher than the\r\nold mare liked, she rebelled, and while she and he were having it out\r\ntogether the load was overturned. Liz and Bet, walking some distance\r\nbehind, rushed forward, and Liz stooped to pick up her father’s coat,\r\nwhich, lying on top of the load, had been thrown to one side. As she did\r\nso she discovered a letter that had dropped out, and at the same moment\r\nhis eye fell upon it.\r\n\r\n“You Liz,” he cried, his voice trembling with excitement; “you leave my\r\nlove letter alone!”\r\n\r\nThe seal was unbroken and Liz turned it over in her hand.\r\n\r\n“Gabe Freeler,” she read slowly, “frum Luce Bozeman.”\r\n\r\n“You give it here,” he reiterated. “Er—mebbe,” sheepishly, “yer mout make\r\nout ter read it. I ain’t rightly guessed what it mout be.”\r\n\r\nThe girl regarded him uncertainly as she hesitated to break the seal.\r\n\r\n“Read it, ef yer kin,” he said irritably, standing beside the mare\r\nnow disentangled from the broken harness and shafts, and mopping the\r\nperspiration from his brow. “Ef ever I’d er be’n ter school three months\r\nI ’low I could read any writin’ thet ever wuz writ.”\r\n\r\n“’Tain’t no three months!” replied the girl with asperity. “’Twasn’t but\r\nonly two months and three weeks; but I reck’n I kin read anything Luce\r\nBozeman kin write!”\r\n\r\n“You gimme that letter!” he flared. “I guess yer won’t git no chanct ter\r\nread it!”\r\n\r\nAs he advanced to take it from her hand the attention of the three was\r\narrested by the approach of a shock-headed youth riding rapidly around\r\nthe bend in the thickly-shaded road. He wore no hat and appeared to be in\r\nexcited haste. Without salutation or unnecessary parley, he delivered his\r\nmessage:\r\n\r\n“She says, air yer er comin’? Yes or no!”\r\n\r\nFreeler stared at him blankly. “Wall, I know who ye air, an’ I know whar\r\nyer come frum,” he said slowly, “but I’ll be durned ef I know what ye air\r\ner drivin’ at.”\r\n\r\n“Luce,” said the boy, “she writ yer a letter and sont it by Dick Weems\r\nlas’ Sadday.”\r\n\r\nLiz and Bet regarded their father silently. His face was a curious\r\nmixture of chagrin, earnestness and baffled determination. He had said\r\nLiz should not read the letter; yet he must know the contents now; and\r\nhow to do it without disclosing to the boy his ignorance of learning?\r\n\r\n“I ain’t but jes’ got the letter a little bit ago,” he said, lying lamely\r\nas Liz’s eyes were upon him. “Liz, thar, wuz jes’ about ter read it when\r\nwe seen yer er comin’—I ain’t seein’ very well sence that spell I had o’\r\nthe yaller janders.” He brushed an awkward hand across his eyes. “Read\r\nit, Liz—ef yer kin!”\r\n\r\nBut this time the girl did not retort; her curiosity invited nothing that\r\nwould delay its satisfying.\r\n\r\n“Ef yer mean what yer sed las’ Sunday,” she read, spelling out the words\r\nslowly, “ther ain’t no time ter lose. Gran’pap Bozeman wuz berried\r\nyistidy, an’ no sooner wuz he in the groun’ than Hiram he sez the place\r\nis hisn now, an’ ef I’m goin ter stay on here I got ter marry him next\r\nChuseday when ’Squire Stark comes here. Which I’ll die fust, fer I ain’t\r\ngoin’ ter marry no cuzzen. In pertickler I ain’t goin’ ter marry Hiram\r\nBozeman which I do despise fer the meanest man on this mountain. Ef yer\r\nment what yer sed, then yer kin come ter the big spring Monday nite an’\r\nI’ll be waitin’ fer yer in the shadder er the ole chestnut. Ef yer ain’t\r\nthar by nine o’clock thar won’t be nothin’ fer me ter do but ter run\r\naway, which I will, so help me God afore I’ll marry him as sez I must.”\r\n\r\n“You will no hoo this is frum fer the name is writ on the outside.”\r\n\r\nGabe sat during the reading as if stupefied, but when Liz had finished\r\nand held out to him the scrawled sheet, he rose. He looked at the sun; it\r\nwas five o’clock and a good three hours to Bozeman’s when the mare was\r\nfresh; he would have to take it easy, for there was the return trip with\r\nthe double burden. “Lord!” he ejaculated under his breath, and threw a\r\nleg over the animal’s lean flank.\r\n\r\n“I ain’t got no hat,” said the boy. “I dropped it fordin’ the crick an’\r\nthis pesky critter wouldn’t let me git it—orneriest mule I ever see!”\r\n\r\n“I got ter git my saddle an’ bridle. Come on an’ I’ll find yer a hat,”\r\nanswered Gabe, as he put off in the direction of his stable, followed\r\nby the other. And in a few minutes the two returning passed Liz and Bet\r\nstill sitting in a state of bewilderment by the side of the overturned\r\nhay load. As they gazed after the disappearing figures Liz turned to Bet,\r\na growing horror in her wide eyes.\r\n\r\n“That’s one o’ Gran’pap’s ole hats he’s got on!” she said in an\r\nawe-struck voice.\r\n\r\nTo reassure themselves they hastened home. Crossing the porch where\r\nthe dog lay asleep, their hurrying feet lagged a little, a sort of\r\nsuperstitious fear upon them. A sound fell upon their ears—a low, piteous\r\nsobbing, that made them clutch each other’s frocks and peer breathlessly\r\nin at the half-closed door. On the sill was a freshly-filled pail of\r\nwater, and in the middle of the floor knelt their grandmother, her head\r\nbowed in the string of wool hats which hung dependant from one nail—in\r\nhis haste Gabe had not taken time to fasten again the end which he had\r\nremoved from the opposite joist. And so it was, when she returned from\r\nthe spring whither she had gone when he entered the house, the sight\r\nmet her gaze—the sacred line of relics trailed in the dust, as it were,\r\naffection’s altar rudely torn of its sacred image, and that by the\r\nruthless hand of her own son—and his son!\r\n\r\nShe raised her head as the boards creaked under the stealthy tread of\r\nthe twins. “He done it!” she cried brokenly, the tears running down her\r\nwrinkled cheeks. “Gabe done it. I seen ’em ez I wuz comin’ up the hil\r\nfrum the spring—him an’ that thar Bozeman boy er ridin’ off—but I didn’t\r\nknow ez ’twuz yer Gran’pap’s hat the boy wuz er wearin’ ’tel I got here\r\nan’ seen it wuz gone, an’ then I knowed it hed looked pow’rful familiar.\r\nBut what did he do it fer? What did he do it fer?” her voice rose into a\r\nlittle wail and her bent form shook with painful sobbing.\r\n\r\nBet stared at her, dumb; her round eyes filled with responsive tears\r\nwhich she wiped away with the corner of her dress.\r\n\r\n“Did he tell yer?” asked Liz. “He’s gone ter git married.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Freeler sank weakly into a chair, and her hands fell limp in front\r\nof her. “I knowed ’twuz comin’,” she said, “but I ’lowed ez how he’d tell\r\nme. He ain’t never married yet ’thout tellin’ me.”\r\n\r\n“He never had time, I reck’n,” said the girl, and then recounted the\r\nincident of the coat and the letter; the coming of the Bozeman boy and\r\nthe reading of the letter, the contents of which were fully detailed;\r\nand, finally, the circumstance which had led to the taking of the hat.\r\n\r\nThe old woman interrupted her not at all, only when she came to the\r\nmention of the hat, wiped her tears again with shaking hand. Then they\r\nsat in silence, drifting after a while into desultory talk, as other\r\noccasions like this came back to memory.\r\n\r\n“I rickerleck,” said the grandmother, “when he brought yer ma home. It\r\nwas jes’ this time o’ year. She wuz the likeliest one of ’em all—I knowed\r\nthe minute I set eyes on her she’d do. The fust one wuz a peart enough\r\nyoung thing, too, but she whirled in an’ died that very summer, an’ in\r\ntwo months he married yer ma. You know how long it’s ben sence the las’\r\none was tuk. Well, Gabe never did lose no time!”\r\n\r\nThe sun’s rays grew less strong; she rose mechanically. “Git up some\r\nlight-’ood knots,” she said, as she gathered her milk pail. “They’ll be\r\nlate gittin’ here, an’ the nights is growin’ chilly. I’ll set up fer ’em\r\nan’ have a blaze in the chimley, an’ some supper ready—he allus wants\r\nsumpin’ hot when he comes in late.”\r\n\r\nAnd when “the chillun” had gone to bed she sat through her lonely vigil,\r\npondering over the advents and the changes the room had known since\r\nthe time she and her “ole man” had been its first occupants, gazing\r\nmournfully upon the string of hats still hanging as she had found\r\nthem, and going now and then to look out on the changing sky. She had\r\ncalculated the extra three miles around by Parson Damon’s would make it\r\ntwelve o’clock by the time they could arrive, and at eleven the moon had\r\ndisappeared and clouds were gathering thick and ominous. She moved about\r\nrestlessly, threw on a fresh pine knot, trimmed the small lamp, and was\r\njust settling herself to renewed rumination when a low “Whoa!” fell on\r\nher ears. Rising quickly, she flung wide the door so that the friendly\r\nlight streamed out.\r\n\r\n“Well, ye’ve come!” she called into the darkness.\r\n\r\nGabe and the mare disappeared in the direction of the stable, and Luce\r\ncame in rather uncertainly after her cramped ride in the chill air.\r\n“Yes,” she replied, blinking in the light, “an’ I brung yer this,”\r\nholding out an old woolen hat. “When Lige Bozeman come back er wearin’\r\nit, I says, ‘That thar ain’t the hat you went off from here with,’ an’ he\r\nsays, ‘No, this yere’s one o’ ole man Freeler’s,’ an’ I says, ‘Well, jes\r\ngive it here, an’ I’ll take it back,’ I says. Which I did, knowin’ what\r\nstore you set by them hats—an’ here it is!”\r\n\r\nThe old woman was trembling violently. She looked at the girl with eyes\r\nthat saw only the lost and recovered treasure. When Luce had finished she\r\nturned from her without a word, and, hurrying across the room, restored,\r\nwith little inarticulate cries of joy and love, the precious hat to its\r\nplace with the other ten, then, mounting a chair, fastened the end of\r\nstring to the joist again. Descending stiffly she turned to her with\r\nglistening eyes.\r\n\r\n“Ye’re welcome,” she said. “It’s the most I’ve ever said to any of ’em. I\r\ninginerally waits to see how it’s goin’ to turn out—yer never kin tell.\r\nBut this time, I says, ye’re welcome—an’ Gabe’ll treat yer right; he\r\nallus good to his wives. Yer know, Gabe’s a master han’ for marryin’!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Knowledge is not so much in knowing as in knowing how to know._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_It was Plautus who said: “To make any gain some outlay is necessary.”_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photo by Julie Royster, Raleigh, N.

H. P. COCHRANE, FRANKLIN, TENN. AND MRS. MARY LEWIS\r\nPRESTON, VA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems but fitting that those who are interested in the great seaman’s\r\nlife should know something of his ancestors and early life.\r\n\r\nHis maternal ancestor in America was Dudas Minor, an English gentleman\r\nwho received large grants of land from King Charles II and settled in\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Matthew Fontaine Maury.]\r\n\r\nOn the father’s side he was of Huguenot descent. Rev. Jas. Fontaine thus\r\ngives an account of Maury’s ancestor, Jean de la Fontaine, a French\r\nnobleman who held an exalted position in the court of Francis I:\r\n\r\nWhen the “Edict of Nantes” was revoked the persecution of the Protestants\r\nfollowed, and Fontaine was a shining light for the Catholics, and it\r\nwas deemed advisable to get rid of so prominent a heretic as soon as\r\npossible. A band of ruffians were dispatched on the memorable St.\r\nBartholomew’s eve, and Fontaine and his wife were dragged from their beds\r\nand their throats cut. “Oh, my children!” exclaimed the narrator, “let\r\nus not forget that the blood of martyrs flows in our veins.” This may\r\nexplain the strong religious bent of Maury’s nature, which was evident to\r\nall long before he connected himself with the Episcopal Church.\r\n\r\nHe was born near Fredericksburg, in Spottsylvania County, Va., January\r\n24, 1806. When he was four years old his parents moved to Tennessee and\r\nsettled near Franklin. Maury assisted his father and brothers on the\r\nfarm, and lived the life of the early settler in a new country. He thus\r\nbecame a sturdy, healthy boy. Here in the wilderness schools and churches\r\nwere alike few and far between, and the education of the pioneer’s\r\nchildren was derived at home, or in the “old held school.” Plain living\r\nand high thinking was the motto in the Maury household.\r\n\r\nMatthew’s father was strict in the religious training of his family. He\r\nwould assemble them night and morning to read the Psalter for the day\r\nantiphonally, and in this way so familiar did the barefooted boy become\r\nwith the Psalms of David that in after life he could cite a quotation\r\nand give chapter and verse, as if he had the Bible open before him.\r\nSurrounded by simple and pure influences, Maury passed his youth. He\r\npossessed a deep and inquiring mind and an insatiable craving for truth.\r\n\r\nPerhaps his greatest mental strength lay in the direction of mathematics.\r\n“My first ambition,” he says, “to become a mathematician was excited\r\nby an old cobbler, Neal by name, who lived not far from my father’s\r\nhome, and who used to send the shoes home to his customers with the\r\nsoles scratched all over with little x’s and y’s.” Maury was sent to\r\nthe Harpeth Academy, taught by the Rev. James Otey, first Bishop of\r\nTennessee, and Wm. Hasbrouck, afterwards a prominent lawyer of New\r\nYork. Here his brilliant mind and studious habits won the esteem of his\r\nteacher, which lasted through life.\r\n\r\nMaury had an exceeding fondness for the sea, which was fostered by the\r\nadventures of his elder brother, who entered the United States navy when\r\nbut thirteen years of age. When Maury made known his determination to\r\naccept the position of midshipman, which the Hon. Sam Houston obtained\r\nfor him, his father did not command him to decline; but he did not\r\napprove it, and would not give him any financial aid, or even his\r\nblessing. This was a great grief to Maury, but he had put his hand on\r\nthe helm, and there was no turning back. So, borrowing a horse, and with\r\nonly thirty dollars in his pocket, and the limited experience of nineteen\r\nyears, he set out to seek his fortune. There was no naval academy, and\r\nthe young middy began his duties and his studies on board a man-of-war.\r\nWhat powers of concentration he possessed, with what unflagging zeal he\r\npursued his studies, proving by his subsequent career that genius is the\r\ncapacity for labor. William Irving, brother of Washington Irving, loaned\r\nhim many books.\r\n\r\nDuring his first year of service his frigate, the Brandywine, conveyed\r\nLafayette back to France. The great Frenchman was much attracted by the\r\nyoung midshipman, and had many a kind talk with him. In 1831 he passed\r\nhis examination, was appointed master of the sloop-of-war Falmouth, and\r\nordered to the Pacific on a four years’ cruise. It was on this voyage\r\nthat Maury conceived the idea of the famous “Winds and Currents Charts,”\r\nwhich have done so much for the commerce of the world.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the United States in 1834 and married his cousin, Miss\r\nHerndon, to whom he had been engaged several years. Shortly after this\r\nmarriage he went to Philadelphia to arrange for the publication of his\r\nworks on navigation. His book, like himself, had the true ring or true\r\nmetal, and won distinction In England and became the text-book of the\r\nUnited States navy.\r\n\r\nAt this period Maury obtained leave of absence, and on his way to his\r\nold home in Tennessee he was thrown from the top of a stage coach, which\r\nresulted in an accident that lamed him for life and interrupted his\r\nactive service afloat. His leg was improperly set, had to be broken again\r\nand reset, and this in a day when anaesthetics were unknown. This period\r\nof enforced inactivity was most distressing to the ambitious lieutenant,\r\nbut proved a blessing in disguise, for it was then that his active mind\r\nturned to and grasped the scientific part of his profession. In 1839\r\nhe began a series of articles on naval reform. He advised that a navy\r\nyard and forts can be established on the Gulf coast. “They cannot be too\r\nstrongly fortified with outfits for shipping and implements of war.” He\r\nadvocated also a naval school for young midshipmen. This article led to\r\nthe building of forts at Key West and the Tortugas, and the establishment\r\nof the naval academy at Annapolis.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 he wrote a notable treatise, entitled “The Gulf Stream and its\r\nCauses.” These and other contributions to science were written under the\r\npen name of “Harry Bluff.” They attracted so much attention and were so\r\ngenerally approved by the navy that the officers had great numbers of\r\nthe papers printed and circulated. When it became known that the young\r\nLieutenant Maury was the author of these papers, his ability and grasp\r\nof mind were universally recognized, and his position as authority on\r\nnaval questions was established. Soon after he was placed in charge of\r\nthe Depot of Charts and Instruments, which office he developed into “The\r\nNational Observatory and Hydrographical Department of the United States.”\r\n\r\nIn a speech before the Senate John Bell said: “No man could have been\r\nfound in the country better fitted than Maury for this difficult duty,\r\nand he worked with the zeal and energy expected of him.”\r\n\r\nAt this time he gave to the world the famous “Winds and Currents Charts\r\nand Sailing Directions.” Seamen were at first distrustful of the new\r\ncharts, fearing that a route which could save from ten to twenty days on\r\nan outward voyage, was fraught with danger. At last a Baltimore vessel\r\ndetermined to follow the new chart. The voyage was a complete success,\r\nfor he made both trips in the time consumed under the old system in the\r\noutward passage alone. There was now no hesitation about the use of the\r\ncharts. Active interest was excited and the world rang with the fame of\r\nMaury’s “Winds and Currents Charts.” Copies were sent to every government\r\nand distributed to men-of-war and merchantmen. It has been estimated\r\nthat “if the money he saved to the world were collected, a monument of\r\nprecious stones could be erected to his memory.” It was frequently urged\r\nthat Maury, who was drawing a pay small in comparison to his service,\r\nmight secure a copyright and thus reap material reward from his labors,\r\nbut his aim through life had been to make himself of use to his fellow\r\nmen, and he did not put in a claim for prize money.\r\n\r\nWhile at the observatory he wrote his “Physical Geography of the Sea and\r\nIts Meteorology.” This work met with great enthusiasm in England and\r\nAmerica, and was translated into many languages for use in the schools.\r\nThe interest now excited in meteorology and deep sea study enabled Maury\r\nto assemble at Brussels, under the auspices of King Leopold, a congress\r\nto which England, Russia, France, United States, Belgium and other\r\ncountries interested in commerce, sent delegates. At the close of the\r\ncongress Maury returned to America laden with honors and rich in fame.\r\nMany of the learned societies of Europe elected him an honorary member.\r\nOrders of knighthood were offered him and medals given him by nearly\r\nevery crowned head of Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Humboldt received the Cosmos Medal as being the greatest\r\nscientist in the world, but he presented it to Maury as being greater\r\nthan he, saying that he was the “founder of a new science.”\r\n\r\nMaury now began to carry out his plan for meteorological co-operation\r\non land. To effect this he was obliged to travel much and deliver many\r\naddresses. Out of these efforts grew the vast “Weather Bureau” of to-day.\r\nAs early as 1848 Maury had believed that a broad level plateau lay\r\nunder seas between Newfoundland and Ireland, and Congress dispatched\r\nthree vessels to perfect his discoveries, and to decide if it would be\r\npracticable to lay the cable between Europe and the United States. He was\r\nconsulted by Cyrus W. Fields and others as to the kind of cable to be\r\nused, the way and the time to lay it. At a dinner given in New York to\r\ncelebrate the first message across the Atlantic, Mr. Field rose and said:\r\n“I am a man of few words. Maury furnished the brains, England the money\r\nand I did the work.”\r\n\r\nIn 1858 Maury was advanced to the rank of Commodore, by special act\r\nof Congress. Maury also originated the idea of water-marks and river\r\ngauging along the Mississippi and its branches. In 1860 he had reached\r\nthe high tide of his worldly prosperity. He began to realize material\r\nbenefits from the fruits of his pen when the Civil War broke out. Mr.\r\nLincoln called for 75,000 troops. Virginia’s answer was secession and\r\na call upon her sons for support. Maury resigned his office and went\r\nto Richmond. Nothing had been offered him by the Confederacy. He had\r\neverything to lose, nothing to gain. He was a peace-loving man, a student\r\nand philosopher; besides, he was greatly opposed to the war. But when\r\nVirginia called he left his congenial pursuits, his achievements and\r\nhis discoveries for what he held to be his duty to his mother State.\r\nWhen it became known abroad that he had severed his connection with the\r\nUnited States, he was invited by France, Russia and Mexico to become\r\ntheir guest, but he declined both. He entered the Confederate States\r\nnavy, with the rank of commodore and chief of the seacoast, harbor and\r\nriver defences of the South. He assisted in fitting out the Merrimac and\r\ninvented a formidable torpedo. In 1862 he established the Confederate\r\nsubmarine battery service, at Richmond. In the same year he was ordered\r\nto England to purchase torpedo material. After the war he was not allowed\r\nto come home for several years.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 he, together with Tennyson and Max Muller, received the degree of\r\nLL.D. from the University of Cambridge. In 1869 he accepted the chair of\r\nphysics in the V. M. I., at Lexington, Va. Here, surrounded by his family\r\nand friends, he passed the remaining years of his life in peace and\r\nrest. He died February 1, 1873.\r\n\r\nI will conclude with two short extracts, the first from the Richmond\r\nDispatch, as follows:\r\n\r\n“The joint resolutions introduced into the Legislature, memorializing\r\nthe President and Congress to erect, in the shape of a lighthouse on the\r\nRipraps, a monument to Commodore Matthew Fontaine Maury, opens the way\r\nfor the nation to efface from its escutcheon a blot that has long rested\r\nthere. Soon after the death of Maury a movement was inaugurated abroad\r\nto build at a point off the coast of Brazil, an international lighthouse\r\nas a memorial to the ‘Pathfinder of the Seas.’ It was intended that each\r\nnation should contribute individually to the fund for this purpose, and\r\nthat the structure should be as enduring as money and human skill could\r\nmake it. The movement found great favor with foreign nations, and would\r\nhave materialized but for the attitude of the United States. When this\r\ngovernment was sounded on the subject it was found that the partisan\r\nhatred and sectional prejudice was so strong at that time that, for\r\ndiplomatic reasons, the matter was dropped.\r\n\r\n“It is designed that the proposed monument shall be dedicated in the\r\npresence of the combined nations of the world. And should the United\r\nStates make the occasion practicable, the grandest naval demonstration\r\nthat has ever been witnessed anywhere, and in any age, may be expected.\r\n\r\n“The great foreign nations in whose scientific societies and aboard\r\nwhose ships Maury’s name is a synonym of reverence, would delight in an\r\nopportunity to pay such a tribute to his genius and to his services. By\r\naffording such an opportunity the United States government would put\r\nhonor not only upon Maury, but upon itself, and reach a higher plane in\r\nthe eyes of the governments abroad than it has ever occupied since the\r\nwar. The memorial not only would be a monument to the ‘Wizard of the\r\nWinds and Currents,’ but a perpetual reminder of the nation’s confidence\r\nin republican institutions and in the fact that we are a reunited\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\nThe second extract is from a tribute paid him by the Hon. A. J. Caldwell\r\nbefore the “Agricultural Society.” He said:\r\n\r\n“A farmer lad, he was trained by his country for the sea. She made him a\r\nsailor; God made him a genius. A genius like Ariel’s, which made wind and\r\ntide and meteor’s glare his servants, and laid its wand upon the main of\r\nthe ocean and made it the servant of the servants of men. The maritime\r\nworld to-day would be lost if his great works were blotted out from human\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n“He first spoke of the submarine telegraphic plateau between Ireland and\r\nNewfoundland, on which the ocean cable is laid. He first told the ocean\r\nsteamers of the ‘sea lanes,’ where, outside of the area of icebergs they\r\nrun safe from shore to shore. And such was the plenitude of his power,\r\nsuch the comprehensive grasp of his reason, and the fullness of the\r\nblessing which his genius bestowed upon the world, that, as experience\r\nand time go by, his scientific methods are adapting themselves to the\r\nneeds of every tiller of the soil in every State of the Union and nation\r\nof the earth. The Signal Service, with its daily weather reports, its\r\nprognostications, control the actions of every intelligent agriculturist\r\nin the land to-day.\r\n\r\n“With Promethean hand he snatched the meteoric fires from heaven and\r\nlit up the altars of industry. He is dead and gone; but what Columbus\r\nwas to discovery, Newton to astronomy, LaPlace to physics, Humboldt to\r\nnational history, Maury was to navigation, meteorology and agriculture.\r\nThe winds and currents of the ocean bear his name around the watery\r\nworld. The lowing herd, the bleating flock housed by him from the storm,\r\nthe flowering meads and golden fields which filled with the shouts and\r\nlaughter of happy toil are memorials on the lands. His memory will\r\nbrighten as the years go by, and the blessings of his genius will reach\r\nevery household and the gratitude of mankind will follow him where sweet\r\nfields beyond the swelling flood stand dressed in living green.”\r\n\r\nRead before the D. A. R., June 30, by\r\n\r\n                                                      MRS. H. P. COCHRANE.\r\n\r\nThe Daughters of the American Revolution plant this tree in honor of\r\nCommodore Matthew Fontaine Maury, that they may show in this simple way,\r\nhere in his old home, how they reverence his name. Also by this act that\r\nthey may help to remove the stain, the disgrace to the American people\r\nthat no monument has been raised to his memory. This small beginning,\r\nthey earnestly hope, will lead to greater endeavor. To this end this\r\nChapter has recently endorsed a petition asking the co-operation of\r\nthe Convention of National Daughters, composed of 7,000 ladies, to\r\nmemorialize Congress to erect a light-house to his memory, to efface from\r\nthe nation a blot which has long rested there. This, indeed, has been the\r\nthird attempt. Soon after the death of Maury a movement was inaugurated\r\nabroad to build on the coast of Brazil an international lighthouse as\r\na memorial to the “Pathfinder of the Seas.” It was intended that each\r\nnation should contribute individually to the fund for this purpose,\r\nand that the structure should be as enduring as money and human skill\r\ncould make it. It would have materialized, but for the attitude of the\r\nUnited States. When this government was sounded on this subject it was\r\nfound that partisan hatred and sectional prejudice were so strong at\r\nthe time that, for diplomatic reasons, it was dropped. Afterwards the\r\nVirginia Legislature petitioned the President and Congress to erect a\r\nlight-house on the Ripraps, off the coast of Virginia, in the Chesapeake\r\nbay. It was designed that the proposed monument should be dedicated in\r\nthe presence of the combined nations of the world, and to be the greatest\r\nnaval demonstration that had been witnessed anywhere and in any age. How\r\nfitting if this could be done at the proposed exposition at Jamestown, in\r\n1907. It is but meet that he should receive the highest acknowledgment of\r\nhis greatness, not only in reparation, but in gratitude, for it has been\r\nsaid if the money Maury has saved to the world by his charts on the winds\r\nand currents and navigation generally, were collected, it would be enough\r\nto build a monument of precious stones to his memory, not to speak of the\r\nsaving of human life. But Humboldt paid him the highest compliment when\r\nhe presented him with the Cosmos Medal, which he received as being the\r\ngreatest scientist of the world. He said Maury was greater than he.\r\n\r\nIt seems particularly appropriate that this tree should be planted in\r\nthe shadow of this school building, as Maury’s text-book is used here to\r\ninstruct the children.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Ladies of the American Revolution, I feel that we honor\r\nourselves in paying this tribute to one who, by his goodness, as well as\r\nhis greatness, has his “name written in the Hall of Eternal Fame.”\r\n\r\nThe following paper was also received by Trotwood’s, written by Mrs. Mary\r\nLewis Preston, Seven Mile Ford, Va.:\r\n\r\nIn the little mountain village of Lexington, Va., on February 1, 1873,\r\nthere passed from earth one of her most choice souls, great in mind,\r\nearnest in work, simple in faith, courted by every civilized nation!\r\n\r\nHis end was so beautifully simple and childlike that even the newspapers\r\nfar and near rang with it. This great man, when called by the God who\r\nmade him, simply lifted his hands in the attitude of a little child\r\nexpecting to be taken up into the arms of a loving father, and died in\r\nthat attitude.\r\n\r\nThis was significant of his character. He was too learned to be doubting,\r\ntoo great for shams, too gentle and trusting for affectation.\r\n\r\nThis man was Matthew Fontaine Maury, “The Pathfinder of the Sea,” born in\r\nSpottsylvania County, Va., January, 10, 1806, and was taken by his father\r\nto Tennessee in his fourth year.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 he was appointed midshipman in the United States navy, making\r\nhis first cruise in the Brandywine, on the coast of Europe and in\r\nthe Mediterranean. In 1826 he made a cruise around the world in the\r\nVincennes. In 1831 he was master of the sloop-of-war Falmouth, but was\r\nsoon acting first lieutenant on the Dolphin, then transferred to the\r\nfrigate Potomac, in which he returned to the United States.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 28 he published his first work, “Maury’s Navigation,” which\r\nwas at once adopted as a text-book in the navy!\r\n\r\nHe was at this time selected as astronomer and offered the place of\r\nhydrographer to the exploring expedition to the South Seas, but declined.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 he was made lieutenant, and not long after met with the accident\r\nwhich lamed him for life.\r\n\r\nWhile unable for active duty, he cultivated his mind, and by his views\r\npublished in the “Southern Literary Messenger,” worked great reforms in\r\nthe navy and secured a naval academy.\r\n\r\nHe first directed the observations of the flow of the Mississippi. He\r\nproposed a system which would enable the observers to give information by\r\ntelegraph, as to the state of the river and its tributaries. He suggested\r\nto Congress efficacious plans for the disposition of the drowned lands\r\non the Mississippi. He brought forward and successfully advocated a\r\nwarehousing system. In 1842 he was appointed superintendent of the depot\r\nof charts and instruments at Washington. He added to his labors of\r\nastronomer the task of unraveling the winds and currents of the ocean.\r\nHe instituted the system of deep sea sounding, leading directly to the\r\nestablishment of telegraphic communication between the continents by\r\ncable.\r\n\r\nThe “Physical Geography of the Sea,” translated into various languages,\r\nis an enduring monument to the genius and usefulness of its author. The\r\npowers of Europe recognized the value of his services to mankind. France,\r\nAustria, Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, Sardinia,\r\nHolland, Bremen and the Papal States bestowed orders of knighthood and\r\nother honors.\r\n\r\nThe academies of science of Paris, Berlin, Brussels, St. Petersburg and\r\nMexico conferred the honors of membership.\r\n\r\nHe left the Federal navy to aid his own State, when Virginia seceded,\r\ndeclining from a sense of duty highly honorable positions from Russia and\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThere have been few greater scientists in the world. Humboldt pronounced\r\nhim “the greatest the world had ever known.”\r\n\r\nThe University of Cambridge conferred on him the degree of L.L. D., and\r\nEmperor of France invited him to the superintendency of the Imperial\r\nObservatory, at Paris. He patriotically preferred to accept the chair of\r\nphysics at the Virginia Military Institute.\r\n\r\nWhile here he prepared his latest work, “The Physical Survey of Virginia.”\r\n\r\nHis remains rest beneath a modest monument of native James River granite,\r\nin Hollywood, Virginia’s beautiful city of the dead.\r\n\r\nWhen he died the Commander of Virginia Military Institute thought it\r\nbut just and proper that every power in the world should be informed,\r\nand telegrams were sent. All were responded to in the most appropriate\r\nmanner, except one—that of the United States. Not one word from our then\r\nPresident U. S. Grant!\r\n\r\nAs his body lay in state at Lexington it was literally covered from\r\nthroat to waist with decorations, some of them the richest and most\r\nvaluable jewels, the gifts of the crowned heads of the earth.\r\n\r\nThen to the man who first gave a complete description of the Gulf stream,\r\nwho first marked out the specific routes to be followed in crossing the\r\nAtlantic, who first instituted the system of deep sea sounding, who first\r\nsuggested the establishment of a telegraphic communication between the\r\ncontinents by cable, on the bed of the ocean, and who indicated the line\r\nalong which the existing cable was laid, who caused the erection of our\r\nnaval academy—to this great man the D. A. R. of America are striving to\r\ninduce Congress to build a suitable monument. And what place could be\r\nmore appropriate than Hampton Roads, and what time better than to have it\r\nready before the greatest naval display the world has ever seen, which is\r\narranged to come off during the Jamestown exhibition in 1907.\r\n\r\nIsn’t it a great mistake that America does not see fit to honor her great\r\nones, and if she does not, why cannot Virginia and Tennessee join hands\r\nand do honor to whom honor is due?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The voice which lives is the one which moulds the souls of men._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom’s Last “Furage”\r\n\r\nBY JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE\r\n\r\n\r\n    Manager’s Note—There has not been a week since we commenced to\r\n    publish Trotwood’s Monthly that we have not received one or\r\n    more letters asking us to reproduce “Tom’s Last Furage,” it\r\n    never having been published in any of Mr. Moore’s books; hence\r\n    is not in permanent form.

It is\r\n    said that no judge ever lived in Alabama, who held so generally\r\n    the love and affection of all the people, white and black, as\r\n    did Judge Moore. It seems almost incredible to relate that the\r\n    last time he was re-elected to office, in a general election,\r\n    in which all parties were represented and all classes of men\r\n    voted, out of 9,500 votes cast, Judge Moore received all of\r\n    them but one.\r\n\r\n    Speaking of his death the Birmingham News said: “In his death,\r\n    the last link of the old leaders of just after the war, passed\r\n    away, honored, loved, lamented sorely; not only by his home and\r\n    district, but by the South. As his pastor said at the funeral,\r\n    ‘let us pray God’s guidance to fill his place; not only as a\r\n    jurist, but in the hearts of his people.’”\r\n\r\n    A few years ago William Jennings Bryan related the story of\r\n    “Tom’s Last Furage,” in an after dinner speech, and said it\r\n    expressed more clearly the relationship existing between the\r\n    old Southern gentleman and his slaves than any story ever\r\n    written.\r\n\r\n    Peace to the ashes of so noble a man. The old Judge has passed\r\n    into the beyond. May he meet and know all whom he loved here,\r\n    even old Tom.\r\n\r\n                                                   E. E. SWEETLAND,\r\n                                                   Business Manager.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Author’s Note.—This story was first published in the Horse\r\n    Review of Chicago, December, 1897, but in December, 1899, it\r\n    was plagiarized by some writer whose name, I am glad to say,\r\n    I have forgotten, and published in Munsey’s Magazine under\r\n    the title of “Jim’s Defense.” Mrs. Frances Herrick Fowler,\r\n    the gifted California writer, called Mr. Frank A. Munsey’s\r\n    attention to the plagiarism and he very promptly wrote me a\r\n    letter of apology. Since then, so many public readers and even\r\n    negro minstrel companies have used the story, giving credit\r\n    to the plagiarized form, that, at the earnest request of the\r\n    editor of The Olympian, I am permitting it to appear again in\r\n    its true form.\r\n\r\n    A coincident so amusing in the plagiarism occurred that I shall\r\n    mention it. Much of the story is an incident in the life of my\r\n    father, Judge John Moore, still Judge of the Black Belt circuit\r\n    of Alabama, and Tom’s home coming, bringing my father’s saddle,\r\n    clothes, and sidearms, is the first distinct memory of my life.\r\n    In plagiarizing it the author in Munsey did little less than\r\n    to change the names, and in doing so he changed “Miss Mary” to\r\n    “Miss Emily,” and thus unintentionally gave all the characters\r\n    their true names.\r\n\r\n                                                            J. T. M.\r\n\r\n    Columbia, Tenn., October, 1903.\r\n\r\nTom was a sly, rollicking rascal of a darkey, with a catfish smile\r\nand a jaybird eye. He was ever ready for a laugh, a joke, a drunk, or\r\na profession of religion. He would spend his nights as quickly in a\r\nbar-room as at a prayer-meeting, and by day he was equally as ready\r\nto battle for politics as for religion. But his strong card was his\r\nwonderful experience “endurin’ de wah,” whither he went as a body servant\r\nto “Marse John,” and his “hairbreadth ’scapes in the imminent deadly\r\nbreach” would have put a flush of envy in the dusky cheek of Othello\r\nhimself. But Tom’s fighting was now mostly under his tongue, and, like\r\nmany who are yet wearing the blue and gray a full generation after all\r\nhostilities have ceased and all animosities should long ago have ceased\r\nwith them, Tom’s war spirit increased as the square of the distance from\r\nthe crack of the last cannon. From his own statements there could be no\r\ndoubt that, besides actually participating in every battle of the civil\r\nwar, the Confederate forces were maintained in the field as long as they\r\nwere, entirely on account of his own skill and genius as a “furager.”\r\n\r\nHis other weakness was his habit of disputing upon questions theologic.\r\nIn this he was peculiarly strong; for, if the discussion waxed hot,\r\nand he found he could not convince his hearer with words, he did not\r\nhesitate to smite the centurion’s ear, or bite off his nose; and as\r\nhis war record among the darkies was already Achillean and his fistic\r\nabilities unquestionable, there were few who were willing to “’spute de\r\np’int wid ’im.” His great argument was the efficacy of faith over work,\r\nand he was so scrupulously religious in his belief that he finally ceased\r\nto work altogether, while it required but the spirit of a July sun and a\r\nweedy garden to set him to arguing with renewed zeal.\r\n\r\nNow, a man is what his beliefs make him; and so the effect of Tom’s\r\nbelief developed one virtue truly apostolic; he took no thought for the\r\nmorrow, what he should eat or drink; he carried no scrip in his purse,\r\nand, at the beginning of this story, he had not even a change of raiment.\r\n\r\nBut his staunch friend was “Marse John,” the old Judge, who had long been\r\nJudge of a Circuit Court in Alabama—so long “the memory of man runneth\r\nnot to the contrary,” as the law books have it. The old Judge was a good\r\nman and a good Judge—so just that the poorest and the blackest negro,\r\nwhen jerked up before his bar, never failed, equally with the richest\r\nand the whitest man in the district, to get that justice to which he\r\nwas entitled. Nay, more; for in the dignified old gentleman who looked\r\ndown upon him, pitying him in his environments of ignorance and poverty,\r\nand scrutinizing the evidence brought out by the wily lawyers with an\r\nalertness that reminded one of an eagle on his eerie watching the sly\r\nmaneuverings of a congregation of foxes below, the poor wretch often\r\nunexpectedly found a strong and stubborn friend. And if the evidence\r\ncontained but the germ of a doubt in the prisoner’s favor, he promptly\r\ngot the benefit of it, though often, to get it, the old Judge had to\r\nbring to bear in the case the guns of his own learned and analytical\r\nmind. As he grew older, he continued to fight for truth with a zeal that\r\nseemed to increase with the silver of his locks, and he would acquit\r\ninnocence though the hangman’s rope was already around her neck.\r\n\r\nThe old Judge’s influence in the district was wonderful, as is always\r\nthe influence of truth and strength. Though unpretentious and often\r\nsilent, not all the preachers of the circuit could have spun the moral\r\nwoof that was in the warp of his work.\r\n\r\nTom had belonged to the old Judge “befo’ de wah,” and had gone through\r\nthat fiery ordeal with his master. There is a peculiarly strong bond\r\nexisting, in the South, between the master and the servant who have thus\r\nfaced death together. The world cannot show a similar instance where the\r\ntie of servitude was forged in the white heat of its destiny.\r\n\r\nAnd so the old Judge now stood up for Tom through thick and thin, and\r\nwhile he openly lamented Tom’s worthlessness, secretly he never failed\r\nto come to his assistance when in trouble or supply him and his family\r\nwith food when hungry. If Tom got in jail, he “saunt for Marse John,” who\r\nquickly bailed him out. If, in a religious scrimmage with another darkey,\r\nhe adopted the warlike methods of Peter, and was fined for assault and\r\nbattery, he “saunt for Marse John,” who, after listening to his tale,\r\npaid his fine before the Mayor; and turned him loose, to the terror and\r\ndismay of all the other darkies who differed from him religiously. If\r\nhe even concluded that marriage was a failure (and the Chancery Court\r\nrecords will show that he did so conclude at least several times during\r\nthe first thirty years after the war), he “saunt for Marse John,” who,\r\nafter listening to his tale, must have concluded that the poor woman\r\nwas entitled to a divorce, whether Tom was or not, as he never failed\r\nto go Tom’s security for the costs and the $15 lawyer’s fee—all that is\r\nrequired in the black belt of Alabama to enable two yoked-up darkies to\r\nseparate, and then proceed to make themselves miserable again in another\r\neffort to solve the problem. This last act raised the old Judge among\r\nthe gods in Tom’s estimation; there was nothing, he thought, Marse John\r\ncouldn’t do. The man who could thus sunder bonds that God had joined\r\ntogether, possessed, in Tom’s opinion, a few Olympian attributes himself.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Tom went on, in spite of the old Judge’s talks, admonitions,\r\nand even threats, until one day something happened. The grand jury\r\nreturned a true bill against Tom for hog stealing. Now, the old Judge\r\nwould do anything in the world for Tom outside of his own court, but when\r\nTom got into that temple of justice, he found himself among the laws of\r\nthe Medes and Persians—and he knew it. If that true bill, properly drawn\r\nup by the solicitor and signed by the foreman of the grand jury, had\r\nindicted the old Judge’s own son, he would have tried him as calmly as\r\nBrutus did his boys of old.\r\n\r\nBut if Tom was in great danger, he never troubled himself about it in the\r\nleast. Throughout the trial he sat with the air of one who considered he\r\nwas being highly honored to be tried by “Marse John,” and in the depths\r\nof his face was a secret exultation that foreshadowed a complete, a\r\nstartling, and even a sensational exoneration.\r\n\r\nHe had stolen the shoat from “the major,” the old Judge’s neighbor, and\r\nthe major made out a plain, dead-shot case against Tom. In fact, several\r\ncolored witnesses, led by the centurion’s servant, as aforesaid, and\r\nothers who differed from Tom religiously, had even waylaid and watched\r\nthe defendant and seen him take the shoat and carry it to his own cabin.\r\n\r\nIn his own behalf, Tom said nothing, but sat with a broad and knowing\r\ngrin on his face, and in his eyes the look of one who, besides having a\r\nstraight flush in his hand, held a royal one up his sleeve. His lawyer\r\nmade a feeble effort at defense, and, after submitting a charge or two to\r\nthe old Judge, who promptly overruled them, the jury was duly charged,\r\nretired, and quickly brought in a verdict sentencing Tom to five years\r\nin the penitentiary. This made Tom chuckle outright; he almost split his\r\nsides in quiet laughter, to the disgust of the court and the astonishment\r\nof his own lawyer.\r\n\r\n“Stand up, sir!” gruffly thundered the old Judge. Tom arose with his\r\nbroadest grin and most waggish air.\r\n\r\n“Have you anything to say why this sentence should not be passed upon\r\nyou?” said the Judge, looking sternly at the prisoner.\r\n\r\nAnd then came a rich scene.\r\n\r\n“Look erheer, Marse John—he! he! he!—I sutn’y am s’prised at you—he!\r\nhe! he!—to sot up dar on dat bench, an’ heah dis jury scan’lize my\r\nrippertashun lak dat, an’ den you turn roun’ dar, so sassy-lak, in dat\r\ncheer, an’ ax me whut I got ter say erbout it—he! he! he! Marse John,\r\nwhut you mean by doin’ dis way? Jes’ tell me.”\r\n\r\nThe old Judge turned red with anger.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Sheriff,” he thundered, “take this prisoner to jail!”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Tom was thunderstruck. Could it be possible Marse John\r\nreally meant it? Was Marse John, the only white friend he had, about to\r\ndesert him? Quick as a shot he changed his tactics. He had tried his\r\nstraight flush and had failed. Now for his royal flush.\r\n\r\n“Hol’ on, Marse John! hol’ on!” Tom cried, dropping his funny ways and\r\nassuming a look of intense earnestness and desperate seriousness. “You\r\ndun ax me now, an’ if nuffin’ else gwi’ do you, I hafter tell you whut\r\nI do kno’ erbout it. An you’ll ’skuze me, Marse John, ef I happens not\r\nto be mealy-mouf ’bout tellin’ it, nurther; fur you makin’ me do it,\r\nwhuther-no. But I want you, gemmen ob de jury, an’ de shearf dar, an’\r\ndese lawyers heah, an’ all ob you, to b’ar witness to de fac’, dat Marse\r\nJohn don’ fotch all dis row down on hisse’f, befo’ all dese heah folks\r\nheah, er-tryin’ to scan’lize my rippertashun. ’Stid ob sayin’ to you\r\nall at the berry fus’, befo’ dis row was urver started: ‘Gem’men, dese\r\nseedlings am squash, an’ dis ole nigger kin go!’ he sot up dar on dat\r\nbench an’ kerry dis thing on, an’ kerry it on, an’ aig you all on, an’\r\naig you on, er s’archin’ an’ er s’archin’ an’ er axin’ questions, an’ er\r\nnosin’ round in my privut bus’ness twell you all, gemmen, jes’ bleegter\r\ngo out an’ fotch in dis heah vurdick—an’ I don’t blame you all ’tall,\r\ngem’men; I don’t think hard of you ’tall. But I sut’n’y was ’sprised at\r\nMarse John, when he turn roun’ so sassy-lak in dat cheer, much es ter\r\nsay: ‘You ole rascal, I’ve got you now! Whut you gotter say erbout it?’\r\n\r\n“Erhuh! Erhuh!” said Tom, chuckling and scratching his head in deep\r\nthought. “Wall, suh, heah’s whut I gotter say erbout it: In korse I\r\ntuck de majuh’s little bitter old po’ shoat! But I jes’ swap fur ’im,\r\nan’ de majuh kno’ as well es I do I was gwi’ gib ’im ernudder one back\r\ndis fawl, soon es my ole sower hed pigs—an’ er heap better shoat den I\r\ngot fum ’im, too; fur, es you all kno’, my old sower is three-quarters\r\nBurksheer, an’ ’fo’ Gord, gem’men, es I stan’ heah on my oaf, ’kordin’\r\nto de supervisement of Marse John, to tell you all whut I kno’ ’bout dis\r\nthing, dat wus de little bitteres’, no-countes’ pig I urver swap fur in\r\nall my life! Gem’men, he didn’t make me one good meal fur de old ’oman\r\nan’ de ten older chilluns, let ’lone de two twins—de majuh an’ de jedge.\r\nWe had ter put dese ter bed befo’ supper, by tellin’ ’em we gwi’ have de\r\npig fur bre’kfus’, an’ ter make ’aste an’ go ter sleep so ester wake up\r\nsoon in de mohnin’ an’ git dey sheer.

Ef it ain’t so, gem’men, an’ dat wa’nt de littles’ razzerback I\r\neber swap fur, den I ain’t nurver stole horgs in Georgy!\r\n\r\n“Erhuh! Erhuh!” said Tom, reminiscently again. “Nurver stole horgs in\r\nGeorgy? Hi-yi-ee! An’ now I’m gettin’ dar, is I? But b’ar in min’,\r\ngem’men, Marse John dun fotch all dis down on hisse’f.

An’ I’d laf an’ say: ‘Marse John,\r\nyou kno’ you ain’t nurver gin me no money fur to get ennything!’ An’ den\r\nhe’d laf an’ say: ‘G’long, you sly raskil, an’ fotch in my bre’kfus’!—jes\r\nlak he wus orderin’ it from er resterrant.

Dat’s\r\nde truf, Marse John, es you kno’ it is yo’se’f; and now I’ve tole it all\r\nes you ax me.”\r\n\r\nAnd Tom sat down.\r\n\r\nFrom suppressed laughter in the beginning of Tom’s speech, the entire\r\ncourt had now dropped into subdued sympathy, and even tears. The old\r\nJudge himself blew his nose vigorously, and looked carefully over his\r\ncharges again, while the major came up and whispered in his ear. Finally\r\nhe said, quietly, yet subduedly:\r\n\r\n“The court is of opinion it has been too hasty in this matter, for, on\r\nreading carefully the second charge submitted by the defendant’s counsel,\r\nthe court is convinced it erred in not giving this charge to the jury.\r\nThe verdict is, therefore, set aside, and a new trial will be given the\r\ndefendant.”\r\n\r\nAnd Tom walked out quietly and solemnly, but a free man yet. But the\r\ncase never came to a trial again. Tom was not himself from that day on.\r\nHe was sobered, subdued, crushed. He seemed to think “Marse John had\r\ngone back on him.” He quit drinking, fighting, and disputing on things\r\nreligious. He even quit telling his experience “endurin’ de wah,” and,\r\nmore wonderful still, he actually went to work. All this was too much\r\nfor him. As the day approached for the trial he became melancholy,\r\nmorbid, and finally took to his bed in earnest. At first they thought\r\nhe would get up soon, but he grew rapidly worse; and a week before the\r\ntrial, the doctor said that Tom would never “furage” again. The old Judge\r\nwas holding court in another county, and had not heard of Tom’s sickness.\r\nHe promptly called the case in its order on the docket. Tom’s lawyer read\r\nthe physician’s certificate as to Tom’s condition. The old Judge looked\r\nworried—even troubled. Then he glanced around the court—the major was\r\nnot there. He took up his pen and wrote quickly across the docket: “Case\r\nnolle prossed; no prosecutor!” and as soon as the court adjourned he went\r\nby Tom’s cabin to see if he wanted anything, and to tell him about the\r\nnol prossing his case. As he neared the cabin he heard the uncanny music\r\nof the negro mourning song, and it startled him as he went in and found\r\nthem chanting it around Tom’s bed.\r\n\r\nHe looked at Tom; he was sober, but dying.\r\n\r\nThe old Judge went up, sat by the bed, and took Tom tenderly by the\r\nhand. The negro’s face lit up for a moment with its old-time light as he\r\nrecognized the old Judge. Then he remembered:\r\n\r\n“Will dey try me ergin; will dey convict de old man ergin, Marse John?”\r\neagerly asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“Not while I am Judge of this circuit, Tom—never!” as he gripped Tom’s\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“Thang Gord, Marse John! thang Gord! I knew you—wouldn’t! You see\r\nI—wus—jes’ furagin’! The majuh knowed it—jes’ furagin’.” He was quiet a\r\nlittle and dozed some. Then he sprang half-way up in bed—a startled look\r\nin his eye:\r\n\r\n“Lemme out! lemme out!” he cried. “Don’t you hear it, Marse John? Dat’s\r\ntaps—de army ob de Tennessee am sleepin’—de lights mos’ out—I must hustle\r\nan’ git sumpin’ to eat—I mus’ furage—gwine on er long furage—but I’ll\r\nwait—on—you—foreber—in—de—camp—dar, Marse John——.” He broke off suddenly;\r\na radiant light gleamed in his eyes; “Miss Mary, my mistis; O dar she am,\r\nbeckinin’ an’ smilin’ to po’ ole Tom; beckinin’ an’ smilin’, ‘Gord will\r\nreward—you—sum—day!’ Oh, home, home, Marse John!”\r\n\r\nTwo hours later the old Judge came out of Tom’s cabin, crying like a boy.\r\nTom had gone on his last “furage.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Casey, the Fifer\r\n\r\nBy HENRY EWELL HORD\r\n\r\n\r\n    [NOTE.—The Editor of Trotwood’s believes this is one of the\r\n    best descriptions of Franklin’s bloody and needless fight ever\r\n    written, and a pathetic pen picture never to be forgotten. Its\r\n    author is an inmate of the Old Soldiers’ Home, Nashville, and\r\n    was one of the bravest soldiers of the Lost Cause. We are told\r\n    by an old comrade of the writer that in one of the fiercest\r\n    fights of the war, a large shell bursted in a foot of Mr.\r\n    Hord’s head, knocking him down and completely destroying his\r\n    hearing, killing two men behind him and one at his side. The\r\n    historic value of this pathetic story is great. It has been\r\n    said and denied that Forrest, with his wonderful foresight,\r\n    went to Hood just before he ordered his army to the holocaust\r\n    of Franklin and begged him for permission to flank the Yankee\r\n    army out, saying he would do it in fifteen minutes, and there\r\n    need be no battle. “No,” exclaimed Hood, “no, charge them\r\n    out.” Forrest rode off in disgust. In studying the battle of\r\n    Franklin for a chapter in the writer’s new novel, “The Bishop\r\n    of Cottontown,” we read all the Records of the Rebellion\r\n    pertaining to the fight, endeavoring, among other things, to\r\n    find some evidence of the truth of this. In Gen. J. D. Cox’\r\n    report we found it corroborated, that General saying in the\r\n    afternoon he saw evidence of Forrest’s Cavalry preparing to\r\n    flank him, and he prepared immediately to evacuate Franklin!\r\n    And thus was Forrest’s military genius corroborated by the\r\n    other side. But here is the man who carried the despatch,\r\n    and the thrilling picture of the brave boys going into that\r\n    veritable mouth of hell so gallantly, and of old Fifer leading\r\n    them on till his tune ceased beneath a clubbed musket, caused\r\n    the writer to lay down the graphic story of this old, maimed\r\n    soldier and use his handkerchief. And no more graphic story of\r\n    Franklin was ever written.]\r\n\r\nThe following characteristic letter accompanied the story:\r\n\r\n    Dear Mr. Moore: I send you the enclosed yarn of Fifer. If you\r\n    think it worth publishing in Trotwood you can do so. I am, as\r\n    you see, not much of a writer like Ben Hord. I get the facts\r\n    all O. K., but, to tell it so somebody will be interested,\r\n    that’s the rub. The trouble about writing a war yarn, no two\r\n    soldiers see things alike, and some fellow is liable to make\r\n    you out a liar before you know it. I once wrote an account of\r\n    a drill we had against the 15th Mississippi for a flag offered\r\n    by the ladies, of Canton, Miss. I gave, as I thought, and what\r\n    some of my old regiment had written, the exact facts. The\r\n    colonel of the 15th Mississippi is still living. He answered my\r\n    article, and made me out seventeen kinds of liars. I felt left.\r\n    Not long after that the last ex-Confederate Reunion was held at\r\n    Nashville. One day I was standing in front of the Tulane Hotel\r\n    watching the big crowd going by, and a man passed with a metal\r\n    badge with “15th Miss.” on it. I stopped him, and asked him if\r\n    he remembered that drill, and when he found out I was in the\r\n    other regiment, he was delighted. He had a crowd of Mississippi\r\n    boys with him, but none of them had been members of the 15th,\r\n    so he stood there and gave them an account of the drill, and\r\n    corroborated every word I had written, though he had never seen\r\n    it. Well, I believe you literary fellows say it is misquoted,\r\n    but we privates have another name for it.\r\n\r\n                          Respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                   HENRY EWELL HORD.\r\n                                   Hermitage, Tenn., Soldiers’ Home.\r\n\r\nIt was at Gainsville, Ala., we parted with our old Fifer Casey. He had\r\nbeen with us ever since the regiment was organized at Camp Boone, Tenn.\r\nHe had fifed all through the Mexican War and nearly three years of the\r\nCivil War. At first he had lots to tell us about Cerro Gordo, Palo Alto\r\nand Chepultepec, but after we got down to business old Casey gave the\r\nMexican War and Greasers a rest.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall, slim old fellow, carried himself as if steel ramrods were\r\nhis regular diet, scorned to ride in an ambulance or wagon on a march,\r\nkept at the head of the regiment all the time, and went into all battles\r\nplaying his liveliest tunes.\r\n\r\nAt Shiloh, in the charge that broke up the “Hornet Nest,” old Casey was\r\nplaying “Cheer, Boys, Cheer,” and the whole regiment singing it as they\r\nclosed in with the Yanks.\r\n\r\nAt the tale end of many a long day’s march, when everybody was footsore\r\nand weary, thinking and wishing for camp, marching any kind of old way,\r\nCasey would notice it, and strike up “The Girl I Left Behind Me” or “The\r\nStump-Tail Dog.” The boys would forget about their weariness, close up,\r\ncatch the step, and before we had gone an hundred feet, without a word\r\nfrom any officer, we would be sailing along like we were “passing in\r\nreview.”\r\n\r\nCasey had a musical chum that belonged to the 9th Arkansas, of our\r\nbrigade, who was just the opposite of Casey—short and stout built. The\r\ntop of his head would scarcely reach old Casey’s shoulder. When those two\r\ngot together with a canteen of whisky there would be little sleeping in\r\nthat regiment that night. We used to call it “The Girl I Left Behind Me,”\r\nwith variations, “Long Girl” and “Short Girl.”\r\n\r\nCasey always refused to be mounted, saying he did not enlist in a cavalry\r\nregiment and did not propose to be killed by some fool horse. He did not\r\ncondescend to ask for any papers, but coolly walked over and joined the\r\n9th Arkansas, with his old chum.\r\n\r\nOur only regret about being mounted was leaving the other regiments of\r\nour brigade—Buford Brigade, Loring Division. We had been together a long\r\ntime, and many battles and long marches had formed many warm friendships.\r\nGeneral Buford had drilled us till we were one of the best drilled and\r\nmost soldierly-looking brigades in the C. S. A., and always gave a good\r\naccount of ourselves in battle. The regiments were the 35th and 27th\r\nAlabama, 9th Arkansas and 12th Louisiana, nearly all young men, and as\r\ngood soldiers as ever marched. After we left, Colonel Scott, of the\r\n12th Louisiana, was ranking officer, and commanded the brigade. General\r\nBuford accepted an offer from General Forrest, and followed us to North\r\nMississippi, where we joined General Forrest. The 3d, 7th, 8th and 12th\r\nKentucky were brigaded, and Col. A. P. Thompson commanded. He was killed\r\na short time after at Paducah, Ky., and General Lyon succeeded him. Lyon\r\nand Bell’s brigades formed the Buford Division.\r\n\r\nWe followed the “Wizard of the Saddle” till the surrender, and were\r\nengaged in every fight and raid in which he was.\r\n\r\nOn the campaign to Nashville in front of General Hood, I was detailed to\r\nact as courier for General Buford. The day of the battle of Franklin,\r\nTenn., General Buford had the right wing of our army. There was nothing\r\nbut General Wilson’s cavalry in front of us. We drove the Yankees back\r\nacross Harpeth River, and at a crossing five miles above Franklin they\r\ndismounted and prepared to make a desperate resistance to our crossing.\r\nThey formed their line on the north bank close to the edge, and across\r\nthe river was an old field which we would be forced to cross to reach\r\nthe ford. They could rake us fore and aft before we could get to the\r\nriver. As soon as General Buford saw the situation, he dismounted two\r\nof Lyon’s regiments back of the field a half mile from the river, and\r\nwith four guns of battery double-quicked them across the field up to the\r\nriver. They then opened a rapid fire on the Yankee line across the river.\r\nThe two lines made a dense smoke which hung like a fog over the river.\r\nUnder cover of the smoke, General Buford with the balance of the command\r\ncrossed, mounted, the smoke completely screening their movement, and the\r\nYankees never fired on them while crossing. The boys had orders to cease\r\nfiring after we got down the bank, which they did. The Yankees thinking\r\nthey had gained a victory because the fire stopped, cheered lustily, and\r\nalmost ceased firing. While they were still cheering, a long line of\r\nstern-faced men cleared the bank and fell onto them with carbine, pistol\r\nand saber.\r\n\r\nI thought I would be smart, and got right behind General Buford, going up\r\nthe bank at a place that I did not think a goat could climb. The General\r\nweighed 320 pounds, and rode a big, old horse. I did not think a ball\r\ncould find me behind such good works. A moment after, when I saw old\r\n“Waggoner” and the General hanging right over me, I thought I had been\r\na little too smart, but old “Waggoner” did not slip. He got his front\r\nfeet on the top and sprang as lightly as a cat right into the Yankee\r\nline. One of them thought he had found a loose horse and grabbed him by\r\nthe bit, but turned him loose with an awful howl. We actually surprised\r\nthe Yankees as much as if we had ambuscaded them from a stone wall, got\r\nthe first fire, which at such close range counts up. The boys who did\r\nthe firing on the south bank, and the battery, mounted and came over\r\nand joined. The Yankees were of the very best brand—tall Westerners,\r\ncould ride and shoot with the best. They put up a good fight, but we got\r\naway with them and scattered them. There was nothing between us and the\r\nNashville and Franklin pike then.\r\n\r\nGeneral Buford made a report to General Forrest, and told him if he were\r\nbacked up by Infantry he would swing on around and grab the Nashville\r\npike, and that would force the Yankees out of their breastworks at\r\nFranklin. I was selected to carry that dispatch.\r\n\r\nTo my anxious inquiry where I would find General Forrest, “Damn if I\r\nknow,” said old Abe. “About Franklin, I guess,” was all I could get.\r\n\r\nThe fight at Franklin was just commencing then. I recrossed the river. I\r\nhad the choice of two routes. The one up the river was shorter, but as\r\nfar as I could see it lay across soft fields that would force me to ride\r\nslowly or kill my horse. The other was a good, hard road that, from the\r\ncourse it ran, I knew must lead into the pike on which General Hood’s\r\narmy was advancing, a few miles south of Franklin. I chose the latter.\r\n\r\nI reached the pike just as Hood’s artillery was going to the front under\r\nwhip and spur.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more thrilling than to see a well-equipped battery\r\ngoing to the front. As far as I could see up and down the pike they were\r\nrushing forward, six horses to each gun, and on the Jump. Cannoneers\r\nsitting braced in their places, stripped to the waist, yelling and\r\nlaughing at everything, as if it were the most joyous thing in the\r\nworld—fighting. The guns followed each other so close, and were going\r\nat such a rapid gait, that I had to watch my chance and slip across the\r\npike. Across the pike, and marching in the field parallel with the pike,\r\nwas the head of General Stewart’s Corps, just passing, the General riding\r\nin front. I knew him by sight, and I thought he might be able to give\r\nme some information as to the whereabouts of General Forrest. I slipped\r\nacross the pike, jumped a wall and saluted General Stewart. The General\r\nreturned my salute as politely as if I were General Hood. I told him who\r\nI was, and asked him if he knew anything about General Forrest.\r\n\r\nHe said no, he had not been to the front yet, and did not know what they\r\nwere doing.\r\n\r\nI had turned, and was riding with him. He then inquired of me what the\r\ncavalry were doing. I told him about the fight at the river, and added\r\nthat if we could get the infantry there would be no serious fight at\r\nFranklin. He seemed to be greatly interested.\r\n\r\nJust then a staff officer came flying down the pike, jumped the wall in\r\nfront of General Stewart, saluted, and said: “General Hood’s compliments;\r\nyou will please move your command forward at double-quick.”\r\n\r\nWhile he was talking to General Stewart, I was sizing him up. He was\r\na young, handsome, dashing looking fellow, finely mounted, and a good\r\nrider, but he looked as proud and haughty as if he commanded the whole\r\narmy. I hesitated some little time before I could muster courage to\r\naddress such a magnificent creature. Poor couriers did not always get\r\ncourteous treatment.\r\n\r\nI think General Stewart noticed my slowness, for he turned to the staff\r\nofficer, and said: “Here is a young man very anxious to find General\r\nForrest. Can you inform him?” The fellow never even looked at me, but\r\nwhirled his horse around and said, “Follow me!” He took the wall, into\r\nthe pike.\r\n\r\nThere was something about that “follow me” and manner that got my back\r\nup. He had hardly got his horse straightened out down the pike before I\r\nwas alongside of him. If my thoughts had been spoken there, they would\r\nhave been something like: “D— you, I have always been used to riding\r\nbeside better men than you are.”\r\n\r\nWe passed the guns as if they were standing still. Never a word or look\r\ndid that fellow give me. He kept on till I thought he was surely going\r\nto charge the town. After I had about given him up as crazy, he suddenly\r\npulled up, and I, not expecting it, shot on by, but stopped in almost a\r\nbound and rode back. Pointing to the right of the pike, he said: “I saw\r\nGeneral Forrest up there a few moments ago, and guess he is there yet.”\r\n\r\nI looked in the direction he pointed, but could make out nothing for the\r\nsmoke. The lines seemed to be close together and engaged in a fearful\r\nconflict. This was my first and lasting sight of the fearful fight\r\nat Franklin. I turned toward the staff officer to get more definite\r\ndirections, and found he had disappeared. I never saw him any more. I\r\nleft the pike and rode in the direction he had pointed. The ground was\r\nstrewn with dead and wounded men. I had to ride slowly. I worked my way\r\nalong in the rear of the Confederate lines a long ways to the right, but\r\ncould not find General Forrest. Then I concluded I was too close in. I\r\nknew he had no command there. I did not think he would go up so close to\r\nthe firing line if he were only looking on, so rode further off and then\r\nturned towards the pike again.\r\n\r\nI had almost reached the pike when I heard someone swearing at a fearful\r\nrate. I could not see very far for the smoke and gloom.\r\n\r\nI thought, “If that is not the General, it’s his twin brother, for nobody\r\ncould swear that way but he.”\r\n\r\nIt proved to be the old boy himself. By that time our lines were giving\r\nway, and men were going to the rear in squads. The General was trying to\r\nrally them. He had worked himself into a terrible rage, had his saber\r\ndrawn, and I expected to see him use it on some of them, and they would\r\nprobably have shot the stuffing out of him. They did not know him, and\r\nseemed to resent his interference. Their own officers rallied them and\r\ncharged those impregnable breastworks nine times, they say.\r\n\r\nI rode up to General Forrest, stuck my dispatch under his nose and told\r\nhim it was very important. He glared at me a moment like he could not\r\nmake up his mind whether to cut my head off or shoot me. Finally he\r\ncalled, “Major!”\r\n\r\nOut of the smoke rode the major and took the dispatch and read it to the\r\nGeneral. I don’t recollect now whether it was Major Strange or Anderson.\r\nBoth were nice men to do business with. Before he got through reading the\r\nreport all signs of anger and passion had disappeared from the General’s\r\nface. It was always my private opinion that most of it was “put on,”\r\nthough I did not tell him so for various reasons.\r\n\r\n“Bully for old Abe,” says General Forrest, after hearing the report.\r\n“Major, tell him to hold what he’s got, and I will be with him as soon as\r\nI see General Hood and get the infantry.”\r\n\r\nHe went off on the jump. We were standing then on the side of the pike.\r\nThe major was dismounted, stooping down writing on his knee, and I was\r\nholding his horse.\r\n\r\nOut of the gloom and smoke came the sound of drum and fife. I looked back\r\ndown the pike and saw a long line of bayonets coming at a double-quick\r\nwith “trailing arms.” They were not yelling, their line as straight as\r\na string, and perfect time. Though they were leaving a broad trail of\r\ndead behind, they kept the ranks closed up. From the stern, set face and\r\nfierce light of battle in their eyes, I could see they meant business. In\r\nfront of them was our old fifer, Casey, and his Arkansas chum, playing\r\n“The Girl I Left Behind Me.” They had two kettle-drums and a bass. They\r\npassed within ten feet of me.\r\n\r\nI yelled at old Casey as he recognized me, and nodded as he flashed\r\npast. I knew then that was our old infantry brigade. I saw General Scott\r\nfurther down the line. It enthused me so to see our comrades going in\r\nso gallantly that I yelled to beat the band. My horse thought hell had\r\nbroken loose somewhere and wanted to go, too. The Yankees were sending a\r\nperfect storm of shot and shell down the pike. Two lines of breastworks,\r\ntwo solid sheets of flame above them, the batteries looked like the whole\r\ntop of the hill was ablaze, but into that hell our old boys charged, over\r\nthe first line like a flash, and a race with the Yankees for the second\r\nline. I watched old Casey. All the musicians were killed or wounded\r\nbefore they reached the second line, but Casey, above the roar of the\r\nguns and the bursting of shells, still marched, playing on, and I could\r\nhear that old fife screaming “The Girl I Left Behind Me.” At last, for\r\none short moment, I saw old Casey’s tall, slim form mount the second line\r\nof Yankee works, and then “The Girl I Left Behind Me” came to a sudden\r\nend. His music suddenly ceased. A Yankee knocked him over the head with a\r\ngun. Casey was captured and sent to prison. I have never seen him since,\r\nbut the last I heard of him he was living in Cadiz, Ky.\r\n\r\nI was called back to my own business by a gentle tap on my knee and heard\r\nthe major say, with a very superior smile: “You seem to be a little\r\nexcited.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t get that way often, Major,” I replied, “that’s our old infantry\r\nbrigade. Look how they go in.”\r\n\r\nHe looked across my horse, and I could see his face light up. “By God,\r\nthose are gallant fellows,” he says.\r\n\r\n“Yes, old Abe trained them,” was my answer.\r\n\r\nThe major gave me the dispatch, and I was obliged to leave at once.\r\n\r\nHood would not give Forrest the infantry nor allow him to flank and\r\nfollow up our victory.\r\n\r\nTwice in twenty-four hours had Forrest let the bars down to the Yankee\r\nrear, and Hood would not take advantage of it. Things were changing every\r\nmoment, and I had to make several trips between Buford and Forrest, just\r\nhow many I don’t remember. I was riding long after the fight was over.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The education which is worth while is the one we learn in making a\r\nliving._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Candle\r\n\r\n\r\nSome people work and wait, and smile and steal, and cringe and plan; make\r\nshifty cuts and cheat, lay up whole tons of revenue and rot and work\r\ntheir lives out—just to see how big a funeral they may have.\r\n\r\n                                                     —JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Strawberry Country\r\n\r\nBY JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        Castleberry, Ala., April 28, 1906.\r\n\r\nThis is the center of the strawberry industry of Alabama. As your car\r\npasses through the pine lands, stretching along the lower half of\r\nthe State, you catch a whiff, now and then, from a passing car-load\r\nof the queen of fruits. It extends practically from the thriving\r\ntown of Greenville to Flomaton. It is a delightful odor—these\r\nstrawberries—mingled with that of the pine, and the perfume of some wild\r\nflower gifted beyond its kind. It is a pretty sight to step off at this\r\nlittle pine-bowered village, which, a few years ago, was virgin pine\r\nlands, and see some five hundred berry pickers in one field of a hundred\r\nacres or more. The pickers are nearly all negroes, and about half of\r\nthem women and children, and they make wages while the season lasts that\r\nshould easily keep them the rest of the year.\r\n\r\nThat is, it would keep anybody but a negro—who never keeps.\r\n\r\nAt two cents a quart they earn from two to four and one-half dollars per\r\nday. They could earn more and save it all if they would work Saturday\r\nafternoons.\r\n\r\nBut a negro, like a mule, has some peculiar ideas engrafted into the\r\nnetwork of his being, garnered from a long line of holiday-taking\r\nancestors. “Like produces like or the likeness of an ancestor” is the\r\nunchanging rule of the physical world; and it must not be forgotten that\r\nfor many thousands of years the negro took nothing but holidays and\r\nwhatever else he found lying around that was good to eat.\r\n\r\nAnd he wore nothing but a smile. This knowledge may help you in solving\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\nIt is creditable to the white man that he has bred any work into him at\r\nall. However, he has ideas on the subject yet, and one of them is that,\r\nsince his freedom, it is contrary to some amendment of his Constitution\r\nto work Saturday afternoons, even in fields carpeted with berry leaves,\r\nstudded with crimson clusters of reflected sunset, cooled with healthful\r\npine breezes and saturated with the perfume the gods loved most and the\r\nsoft balminess of the eternal spring in the sky.\r\n\r\nThat sounds like heaven, but it is not the heaven the negro wants. That’s\r\nthe white man’s heaven, and the white man would just be fool enough to\r\nwork right on till dark, making that extra two dollars and saving it\r\nand all the rest of his week’s wages by keeping away from the dives of\r\nnear-by towns.\r\n\r\nBut the white man is a vain and foolish creature to the negro.\r\n\r\nHe has aspirations and he lives for the morrow. The negro has none—the\r\npure-blooded negro never had an aspiration in his life—and he lives not\r\neven for the day but for the night following it, when his work ends and\r\nhe may be a nigger among his kind.\r\n\r\nThe white man works to accumulate; the negro to spend. And Saturday\r\nafternoon and night is a bully time to spend what he has made the rest\r\nof the week. There is only one better time, and that’s the next day, if\r\nthere is a foot-washing or a funeral.\r\n\r\nThat’s enough for the negro. His problem is nearly solved, for the tide\r\nof immigration that has been flowing westward is being turned southward.\r\nAnd when it turns there will be no negro question. Like everybody else he\r\nwill take his place in the order of things where his nature fits. He will\r\nbe then one muscle in the South’s great arm of labor, but he will never\r\nbe the biceps.\r\n\r\nI found the people primitive, but honest and kind. They have lived around\r\nhere all their lives, and this thing is a revelation to them. It is more\r\nmoney than they ever heard of before. Why, people actually carry bags of\r\nsilver around with them to pay off pickers. Heretofore the land had been\r\nmost anybody’s for the asking, but now they can make more money on one\r\nacre properly tended to berries than they had before on a whole farm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Berry field and pickers, Marble, Alabama.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A group of berry pickers.]\r\n\r\nA small boy came in going to mill, driving two little steers hitched to\r\na cart with wheels as primitive as the ancient Britons used, sawn from\r\nthe sound pine logs. He is immediately surrounded by the jolly drummers,\r\nwhile their picture is taken for Trotwood’s. The big, two-wheeled log\r\ncarts used for hauling the big pine logs, are everywhere. Four, five,\r\nsix and even twelve yoke of oxen are seen in the woods or on the roads,\r\nwith tall, rawboned, sinewy fellows driving them with a long whip able to\r\nreach to the farthest yoke. He whirls it around his head and it cracks\r\nwith a noise that would make it a great thing for a small boy on the\r\nfourth of July.\r\n\r\nOnly it takes a man to crack it, and I noticed that it never fell on his\r\npatient team—only the terrible exploding crack popped in the air above\r\ntheir ears, and I rather thought the yoke seemed as proud of it as their\r\ndriver, for after every crack I noticed he added soothingly and softly:\r\n“Haw there, Buck!” and Buck hawed calmly, as if he was not at all afraid,\r\nnor even in a hurry, and they all went forward together with the steady\r\npull of perfect understanding between the man and his team.\r\n\r\nI induced one of them, a lithe, fine looking fellow, to stop his team in\r\nfront of a car of berries, that I might take them, whip and all. And as I\r\nlooked at him I knew that in all his life nothing he had ever eaten had\r\never disagreed with him, and that he had eaten everything that came his\r\nway.\r\n\r\nO for his legs and back and these pineland quail, and my own love for\r\nhunting!\r\n\r\nThis pine belt of Alabama (I think while geology was fresh with me that\r\nit was called a tertiary formation, it came far after the carboniferous\r\nperiod around the Birmingham district) is one of the finest opportunities\r\nin the world for the homeseeker. The price of the lands is simply a song\r\nwith a pine-top attachment. Two dollars per acre, wild, and the improved\r\nlands ten to fifteen. They are sandy, with a good clay foundation, and\r\ncapable of holding what they get, and of great improvement. When I went\r\nthrough them last they were a wilderness untouched, save where large\r\ncorporations had gobbled them up in vast tracts for almost nothing and\r\nheld them for the long-leafed yellow pines upon them. After the sawmill\r\ncame the cotton and corn. And of late has it been learned that in this\r\nbelt alone lie possibilities of all kinds of fruits and vegetables,\r\nundreamed of four or five years ago. It is safe to say that in the belt\r\nalone, extending from the seaboard clear across the South, through Texas,\r\neven, and Oklahoma, lies the future’s great early fruit and vegetable\r\narea of the continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A load of Klondyke berries ready for the car.]\r\n\r\nThe industry has scarcely begun here yet, and that only along the line of\r\nthe railroad, and yet from Castleberry the L. & N. railroad is shipping\r\nfrom five to ten car-loads of strawberries alone per day.\r\n\r\nThe American people are now rich—richer than any nation ever was before.\r\nThey are learning how to eat and to live comfortably, and to spend their\r\nmoney for delicacies. They hunt Southern climates in winter and winter\r\nclimates in summer. Once, when they were poor, they were satisfied with\r\nthings in their season. In the memory of the young man of to-day he who\r\nused ice or had ice cream in summer was classed as the profligate Solomon\r\nspoke of, and was destined to die in rags. As for having strawberries\r\nin February and March, tomatoes at Christmas, asparagus the year round,\r\ncabbages, lettuce—many of the vegetables so common that even the poor may\r\nindulge now and then out of season—it was undreamed of. Think of what\r\nit will be a century from now. Think of it and all this great, balmy,\r\nbright-watered, sky-domed, clay-founded, health-breeding, beautiful,\r\nblossoming land, greater in extent than a half dozen Eastern States,\r\nlying sweet and cool under the dark green of shadowing pine, untouched\r\nby ax or plow, that may be bought up for two dollars, and needs only a\r\nlittle brains and energy to flush crimson in peach or berry or green in\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\nAnd will it pay? I will give just one instance, not the unusual incident,\r\nbut the common one. I had walked around taking in the pretty picture at\r\nCastleberry, the cottages among the pines, the great gaps cut out solidly\r\nin the woods, forming fields alive with pickers, veritable pictures of\r\nlife in paints of red and green, and enclosed in frames of deep emerald.\r\nI crossed the yellow, bright waters of a creek, stepping from log to\r\nlog. I saw a dozen kinds of birds that had not yet reached Tennessee\r\nin their northern flight. Wild vines and flowers bloomed everywhere. I\r\nwalked two miles along from Castleberry to Marble, another coming town of\r\nberries and fruits, enjoying it all as I did as a boy, when I wandered\r\namong these trees of poetry in a land of poems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUYING BERRIES AT CASTLEBERRY, ALABAMA.\r\n\r\nThis photo shows fifteen berry buyers from as many different commission\r\nhouses. Over sixty houses have been represented at different times this\r\nseason at Castleberry.]\r\n\r\nThe very smell of them said “home.” The skies said “home,” the dying\r\npine needles, giving out their aroma beneath the foot, the way a little\r\nstiff-tailed woodpecker shifted around a rotting pine stump. It meant\r\nhome and memories—memories that had slept embalmed.\r\n\r\nLife—it has always hurt me. Was it given us for pain, that we might not\r\nbecome as the fatted swine, who, having no hurt neither have any hope of\r\nimmortality?\r\n\r\nTo me it has been one great hurting and the times I have been joyous are\r\nthe times I have acted in self defense.\r\n\r\nI unslung my little kodak and tried to take a razor-back in the edge of\r\nthe woods. I wanted a good picture of one—this hog of the Cracker South,\r\nwhose sinewy, lean, sweet bacon is sought for at fabulous prices by the\r\nnobility of Europe. I approached him with confidence, thinking he would\r\nrecognize me as an old friend—nay, even, from my build, as one of his\r\nkine. (A horrid pun, but a slippance.) But the razor-back is born in the\r\nland of the darky, and the same great Designer who gave lightness to the\r\nfingers of the darky gave speed to the heels of the razor-back.\r\n\r\nAnd thus has he survived and still lives. I think he did not even stop to\r\nlook at my face. To this day he thinks I was black.\r\n\r\nAround Marble there are 350 acres in strawberries and 100 or more in\r\nAlberta peaches, and as I stepped into the clearing I met a native with\r\na good, honest face and carrying a bag of silver in his hands. We soon\r\nbecame acquainted and he told me his name was John Barns and that he\r\nwas going to the field to pay off his pickers. It being Saturday noon.\r\nI found him very straightforward and not inclined to exaggerate. He had\r\nbought his farm of 240 acres Christmas, 1901, for $500. His daughter\r\nmarried one W. W. Wright, who took a notion to plant strawberries—just\r\none acre. He set out the plants December, 1905, and though this had\r\nbeen the poorest year in the history of the berry around Marble, the\r\nlate spring and frosts holding them back fully three weeks, and cutting\r\noff the first crop entirely, Mr. Wright had cleared, after paying for\r\nhis plants, labor, fertilizers and picking, one hundred and twenty-five\r\ndollars on that acre.\r\n\r\n“Now, 1903 was our best year,” said Mr. Barns, and he pulled out a little\r\nnotebook he had. “Now, that year I planted my first berries, one and\r\none-quarter acres, and they netted me $521.27, to be exact.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    “Under the dark of shadowy pines\r\n    Untouched by axe or plow.”]\r\n\r\nWe were joined, as we walked along, by another native, Mr. W. R.\r\nAdkinson, who told me that in 1905 his neighbor, Mr. Elisha Downing,\r\ncleared $2,050, net, on seven and one-half acres of berries. They both\r\nagreed that this year was not so prosperous, and yet the railroad agent\r\ntold me they shipped fifteen carloads the Saturday before. They fetched\r\n$2.50 to $3.50 per crate f. o. b. track at Castleberry. There were\r\nseveral representatives of rival commission houses on the ground all\r\nduring the shipping season.\r\n\r\nAlthough the section is comparatively new in the berry and fruit\r\nbusiness, I found it had spread all up and down the railroad, and from\r\na reliable party I found the area planted to be about 1,800 acres in\r\nberries and 1,100 acres in Alberta peaches, extending from Bolling and\r\nincluding Garland, Dunham, Owassa, Evergreen (a beautiful little town and\r\na great health resort), Sparta, Marble, Castleberry, Kirkland, Brewton\r\n(another beautiful and thriving town), Flomaton, Century and Canal. An\r\nhundred acres will be planted at Evergreen this year in cantaloupes,\r\nwhile many cars of radishes were shipped from Greenville this year.\r\nEighteen hundred acres out of as many hundred thousand, and two or three\r\nweeks of strawberries for the millions of people who have been waiting\r\nall winter for them! This looks small and shows what may be done in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Adkinson and Mr. Barnes on their way to pay the berry\r\npickers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Before the berries came.]\r\n\r\nAt Marble I found a most interesting strawberry farm, and there I saw\r\nthe field dotted with pickers, a picturesque, poetic sight, especially\r\nwhen dinner time arrived and the berries came in with the cream. The\r\nberries we had for dinner were red and firm, with a fine flavor, and Mr.\r\nLister, who raised them, assured me that just thirty-five days before,\r\nor on March 23, he had transplanted the vines. He called them, I think,\r\nthe Three W’s, though other berries which were cultivated for market were\r\nLady Thompson, Klondike and Excelsior.\r\n\r\nI found Mr. Lister a great stickler for fertilizer, and though he said he\r\nhad not yet been able to carry out his plans fully, he recommended the\r\nfollowing as a sure process to attain the highest degree of success in\r\nraising the berries: Five hundred pounds of acid phosphate and cottonseed\r\nmeal, equal parts, to begin with. Later, in October, side dress them\r\nwith 500 pounds equal parts acid phosphate, cottonseed meal and kainit.\r\nTop dress in February with 400 pounds fertilizer, one-eighth per cent.\r\npotash, seven per cent. acid phosphate and five per cent. nitrate soda.\r\nAfter they are one year old about 500 pounds under them in fall, and so\r\napplying about three dressings a year, every four months apart, of about\r\n400 pounds, for feeding the plants and building the foundation for the\r\nberries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “I induced one of them ... to stop his team in front of a\r\ncar of berries, that I might take them, whip and all.”]\r\n\r\nMr. Lister thinks that the land may be bought cleared, fenced,\r\nfertilized, planted and cultivated ready to pick for sixty dollars per\r\nacre. The following are some of the companies I found engaged for a\r\nhundred miles down the line of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad. I was\r\nunable to get all of them: Bolling Stock Company, Bolling, Ala., about\r\n$20,000, eighty acres in berries, eighty in peaches and tomatoes in car\r\nlots; Garland Company, Garland, Ala., forty acres; Dunham Stock Company,\r\nDunham, Ala., sixty acres, radishes in car lots; Brown Shepard Fruit Co.\r\nand Gravella Fruit Co., Owassa, about 215 acres in berries and peaches;\r\nEvergreen, Ala., about 100 in berries and 300 in peaches; Sparta, Ala.,\r\nforty acres in berries; Marble, Ala., 350 acres in berries and 100 acres\r\nin peaches, and so on, as enumerated above. In some places I have found\r\nthat they were planting the berries between the rows of peaches, and,\r\nthey tell me, with good results. Mr. W. D. Brown, of Gravella, told me of\r\neight acres of berries which netted their owner $1,800. I was impressed\r\nby the fact that the entire business was in its infancy, so far as\r\ngauging the possible demands of the future or in establishing the line\r\nof fruit and berries for which the land was adapted. As time goes on\r\nthey will doubtless find that the land will be found suitable for both\r\ncantaloupes and watermelons and fruits of all kinds, including figs and\r\ngrapes. In the matter of grapes alone, I happen to know that in a similar\r\nsection in Butler County, Ala., a light, sandy land, with good clay\r\nsubsoil, the finest of Scuppernong grape arbors flourished, some of them\r\ncovering a half-acre of ground, from which the best of home-made wines\r\nare brewed.\r\n\r\nThroughout all that section of the South, the land itself is good for\r\nall farm purposes, differing, more or less, in different sections, but\r\nall capable of holding the fertilizer used and returning good crops of\r\ncotton, corn, oats, sugar cane, peas and other legumes. I doubt if better\r\ncotton lands may be found in the South than in the pine flat section of\r\nAlabama. On all of these lands wild grasses and clover grow in abundance,\r\nand I find the cost of growing stock reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nStrawberries and fruits are the poetry of it—the prose is there, too, and\r\nawaits only the hand of the practical, steady, industrious man to make as\r\ngood a yield of good things all under the fairest skies and in a climate\r\nas healthful and amid people as hospitable as may be found in all the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe History of the Hals\r\n\r\nPART X.—THE FIRST TOM HAL\r\n\r\nBy JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Tom Hal of which there is any record was a roan pacer about\r\nfifteen hands high or a little over, with a black mane and tail,\r\nvery strong and well muscled, and of a great deal of style. He was a\r\nclean-limbed, beautifully-turned little saddle horse (if tradition has\r\nit right), remarkably fast at the pace and going all the saddle gaits,\r\nespecially the running walk or fox trot, so desirable then, as now, when\r\na business gait under the saddle was needed. This was about the year\r\n1824-5; and he was ridden (so says tradition) by a Dr. Boswell, who\r\nbought him in Philadelphia and rode him from that city to Lexington, Ky.,\r\nhis home. Boswell called him a Canadian, and declared he was the best\r\nsaddle horse he ever rode. He also said he was an iron horse, and later,\r\nto prove it, he agreed for a wager to ride the horse from Leesburg, Ky.,\r\nto Louisville, a distance of about seventy-five miles, and back, in the\r\nsame day. It was midsummer at that. He did it, but tradition says the\r\nhard, hot ride came nearly ruining the horse, causing him to go blind. I\r\nhave often thought of this Dr. Boswell. A right gallant pill mixer and\r\nletter-of-blood he must have been. I have never heard anyone describe\r\nhim, but I think I can: A good natured, horse-loving, poker-playing,\r\njolly cuss, a little fat, with a well padded seat, or else he had not\r\nbeen so fond of a saddle and seventy-five miles a day. No skinny man\r\never sticks to a saddle long. They prefer to walk, even in those days\r\nwhen all the goods for the Western Settlement (as Kentucky and Tennessee\r\nwere called) were purchased in Philadelphia and hauled across the\r\nmountains five hundred miles, or floated down the rivers a thousand. So\r\nBoswell loved a horse, and loved to ride. He was not averse to sharp\r\nhorse-trading (as was customary in those days), nor did he fail to put up\r\na little wager now and then, as witness his bet that he could ride Tom\r\nHal from Leesburg to Louisville and back in a day.\r\n\r\nNow, in studying Boswell and his horse, we must go back to the times in\r\nwhich they lived. Philadelphia was the city which then rivaled New York,\r\nand was the business market for nearly all the Western and Southwestern\r\nStates and Territories. In our story of the Hermitage we have seen that\r\nGeneral Jackson bought all the goods for his store, even as far as\r\nNashville, in Philadelphia. It was the great mart for the Western world.\r\nAnd all men rode in those days. There were few roads, and rough ones, and\r\nwhen the now famous Dr. Boswell (it is very likely he was a young fellow,\r\nwho finished his medical education at old Jefferson College) started\r\nback to Kentucky, the cheapest and best way to get there was to buy a\r\nCanadian pony, ride him through, and sell him in Kentucky. Anyway, that\r\nis what he did.\r\n\r\nA sad pity it was that the booted mixer of pills and calomel did not\r\nleave some record behind as to just what the little roan was. A sad pity\r\nhe did not tell us in enduring lines why he called him Tom Hal, whom\r\nhe beat in a horse trade when he got him, whom he robbed when first he\r\nmounted the original Tom Hal and rode him to Kentucky to fame.\r\n\r\nFor Boswell is famous—yea, as the other one was, for the other one is\r\nknown as the biographer of Johnson, and this one as the biographer of the\r\nlittle Canadian pacing stud horse, the immortal Tom Hal, the pregenitor\r\nof the tribe of Hals.\r\n\r\nGlorious Boswell, we know not what was his life, nor how nor when his\r\ntaking off; nay, nor whom he took off—though we may be sure that in his\r\nday and generation he did his share with his lancet, his blue-mass and\r\nhis calomel. Doubtless around the classic town of Lexington, perhaps\r\neven from Leesburg to Louisville, he left in his track lamenting widows\r\nand heart-broken orphans, whose sires first called in the horse-trading\r\nBoswell, and whose widow next called in the undertaker. Many a night,\r\ntoo, he rode the little pacer through the mud and sleet to the cabin of\r\nsome lusty pioneer who had partaken too freely of biled cabbages and\r\nmoonshine, and let a quart of blood from his guzzled body at the time\r\nhe needed it most, or put a hot rock on the stomach that already had\r\ntoo much thereon. Often—often—the little pacer followed the trail of\r\nthe stork at a two-minute clip, until, doubtless, in the language of\r\nSentimental Tommy, he knew the difference between the wail of a “kid” and\r\nthe groan of a “deader.”\r\n\r\nAnd the pride of it—the glory of it! Didn’t every barefoot boy know him?\r\n“That’s Dr. Boswell an’ Tom Hal.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t the boys around the old fort store know him?\r\n\r\n“Doc, thet’s a hell of a good little pony you’re ridin’.”\r\n\r\nDidn’t all the old grannies know him: “Thar comes the Doctor, Sal,\r\na-ridin’ his little amblin’ stud. Lemme get some clean sheets on the\r\nbed.”\r\n\r\nDidn’t all the world know him—all the great, wide world, extending from\r\nLeesburg to Louisville? For there was nothing beyond. You bet your life\r\nthey did. They all knew “Doc an’ his pacin’ stud.”\r\n\r\nAnd Doc died and went the way of all the others he helped over the Styx,\r\nand, saddest of all, he left us nothing that we know.\r\n\r\nFor knowledge at last is just nothing that we know.\r\n\r\nLess even than Shakespeare. For we know positively three things of Shake:\r\nHe stole a deer in his youth, he married Anne Hathaway in his manhood,\r\nand he died and left a will in his older age—left a will in which he\r\nvery cautiously told what was to be done with his best bed. But Tom Hal,\r\nthe equal of his kind—equal even to Billy Shake and Dr. Jonson—of Tom\r\nHal (he never had any best bed), and all we know is he was bought in\r\nPhiladelphia, was a little, clean-limbed, rubber-hard pacer, and had his\r\neyes ridden out of his head by a little wind-galled, blood-letting Doctor.\r\n\r\nGreat is Billy Shake! Great is Tommy Hal! Genius runs in parallel lines,\r\nand after centuries of mixing recipes to produce it, mankind has given\r\nit up and is willing to let it hit the earth now and then, untrammeled\r\nby toe-weights, unreined, unchecked, unbitted and unspurred. Shakespeare\r\nonce wrote a description of a horse. You will find it in Venus and Adonis\r\n(if you’re not an old maid or a preacher), and this verse is as great and\r\nbeautiful a description of Tom Hal, as he was and as he must have looked\r\nthen (barring his “fet-locks shag and long”), as the poem itself is the\r\nmost vivid and beautiful story of red-hot, immodest love:\r\n\r\n    “Look, when a painter would surpass the life\r\n      In limning out a well proportioned steed,\r\n    His art with Nature’s workmanship at strife,\r\n      As if the dead the living would exceed:\r\n\r\n    “Round-hoofed, short-jointed, fet-locks shag and long,\r\n      Broad breast, full eye, small head and nostril wide,\r\n    High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,\r\n      Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide—\r\n    Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,\r\n      Save a proud rider, on so proud a back.”\r\n\r\nBut the horse of Shakespeare’s day was not the horse of Tom Hal’s day.\r\n\r\n“Round-hoofed, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,” doubtless\r\nexpressed the Norman blood that Shakespeare knew. To-day the round-hoofed\r\nones are plugs, the short-jointed ones are cart horses, and those with\r\nfetlocks shag and long are close kin to the Mustang.\r\n\r\nBut the rest of it was Tom Hal:\r\n\r\n    “Broad breast, full eye, small head and nostrils wide,\r\n      High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong.”\r\n\r\nYes, all this was the first Tom Hal—and more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                    Lexington, Ky., May 3.\r\n\r\n    Mr. John Trotwood Moore, Nashville, Tenn.\r\n\r\n    My Dear Sir: In one of your issues you say that “in 1816 Maria,\r\n    at Lexington, Ky., beat Robin Grey.” My maternal grandfather,\r\n    Benjamin Hieronymous, of Clarke County, Ky., was Robin Grey’s\r\n    original owner (owned his dam, of course), and slept all night\r\n    in the stall with her the night little Robin was foaled, March,\r\n    1804—such glowing visions inspired him of the coming prodigy.\r\n\r\n    Hence, if Maria beat Robin Grey in 1816, it was when Robin\r\n    was twelve years old. But there must be some mistake about\r\n    it. If reliance can be placed on tradition, it was the boast\r\n    of my grandfather to the day of his death, June, 1859, when\r\n    in his ninetieth year, that Robin Grey won every race, from\r\n    one-quarter to four miles, that he ever entered. In boyhood I\r\n    read the worn copy of a famous placard, of which this is the\r\n    substance: “Captain Cook’s celebrated ‘Whip’ challenges any\r\n    horse, mare or gelding to run any distance, from one-quarter to\r\n    four miles, barring Robin Grey.”\r\n\r\n    Captain Cook was a Virginian, and owned, I think, a famous\r\n    mare, “Fanny,” or I may have the names mixed, and give my\r\n    early impressions. For more than fifty years the children and\r\n    grandchildren of the grand old man were raised on Robin Grey.\r\n    No man ever idolized the genus horse as he did—not General\r\n    Jackson, nor Hanie, nor Bailie Peyton. I fear he was really\r\n    a crank on the subject of the horse, and Robin Grey was his\r\n    prophet. Two gentlemen were once visiting his paddock, when one\r\n    of them (perhaps in a spirit of fun) discredited a pet of its\r\n    owner. Quick as a flash the critic went down. In a moment the\r\n    assailant was penitent, led the victim tenderly to the house,\r\n    washed the crimson from his face, saying: “I’m sorry—I’m—so\r\n    sorry! But you oughtn’t to insult my horses. There now; it’s\r\n    all over!” Better offend him personally a thousand times than\r\n    to insult his horses.\r\n\r\n    It was at the old Lexington race track. Robin Grey was there,\r\n    and his owner, also, of course. “Hurry up, Mr. Hieronymous! The\r\n    other horses are about ready to start,” the judges called.\r\n\r\n    “Go ahead, gentlemen, whenever you like,” replied the\r\n    enthusiast, “a quarter or a half minute, or such a matter,\r\n    doesn’t make the least difference to Robin Grey. He’ll be in at\r\n    the home stretch.”\r\n\r\n    I could relate, if you had the patience to read, many amusing\r\n    and, to me, at least, thrilling stories of Robin Grey. Mr.\r\n    Hieronymous sold a half interest in him to Col. John Hunt,\r\n    grandfather of the afterwards famed cavalry leader, Gen. John\r\n    Hunt Morgan, such were the exigencies of security debts. But\r\n    the old man never loved a child more devotedly than he loved\r\n    Robin Grey.\r\n\r\n    I must modify the statement that Robin Grey never lost a race.\r\n    Once, the old Lexington track had been recently repaired and\r\n    widened, and a bridge near the first quarter laid across a\r\n    gully to supply the necessary width, and covered with dirt.\r\n    Unfortunately Robin Grey took this side of the track, went,\r\n    heels up, through the treacherous but unsuspected pitfall,\r\n    threw his mount and himself to the ground, but was up at once\r\n    and waited for his rider to spring again into the saddle,\r\n    for Robin had the brains of a statesman. Even then he made\r\n    sufficient speed to save his distance.\r\n\r\n    Please don’t ever tell it, especially to “one of his kinfolks,”\r\n    that anything on four feet ever beat Robin Grey!

We are glad, however, to publish the above.—Ed.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_He who jests is weak, and nothing kills greatness like humor._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Our Writers\r\n\r\n\r\nThe South’s Need for a Magazine of Its Own.\r\n\r\n    Editor Trotwood’s:\r\n\r\n    While New York and the East may be the natural publishing\r\n    place for American magazines, it should not be forgotten that\r\n    the South has within itself many important problems peculiar\r\n    to itself. If one should start from the Potomac and travel\r\n    southwest two thousand miles, barring mountainous sections,\r\n    he would find, generally speaking, less difference in people,\r\n    customs, and institutions than he would be going one or two\r\n    hundred miles north from that river. Coupled with this fact,\r\n    the following story may not be without significance:\r\n\r\n    A Northerner who had moved South noticed that his new neighbors\r\n    had what struck him as being a rather unsatisfactory method\r\n    of doing a certain thing. So he wrote an article suggesting\r\n    another method and sent it to a local publication. The\r\n    editor returned the article, pronouncing what it proposed to\r\n    be “impracticable and visionary.” The writer then sent the\r\n    article to a Northern publication, at the same time asking if\r\n    what it proposed was impracticable or visionary. It was again\r\n    returned, but the returner stated that, so far from proposing\r\n    anything impracticable or visionary, the trouble lay in the\r\n    opposite direction. He said that what was proposed had been\r\n    in successful operation so long that it would be useless and\r\n    tiresome reading.\r\n\r\n    This story seems to me to illustrate the case of innumerable\r\n    subjects important to the South. In the matter of education,\r\n    for example, what would sound revolutionary in some Southern\r\n    States would, I believe, be called pioneer work by the majority\r\n    of American-born Northerners. Again, in the realm of economics,\r\n    most of us in the South have yet to learn some of the first\r\n    principles. As to our code of social relations there are some\r\n    sections, fertile and penetrated by railroads, which are in\r\n    vital respects half a century behind the advance guard of\r\n    Anglo-Saxon civilization. As to our courts of justice, although\r\n    law has been the favorite profession of our ambitious young\r\n    men, and although we are supposed to have some of America’s\r\n    ablest practitioners, it seems that almost none of them ever\r\n    try persistently to contribute anything towards making either\r\n    our courts or our politics better, and by so doing accomplish\r\n    that for which courts and politics are supposed to exist. In\r\n    conclusion, let it be remembered that not only the Northern\r\n    magazines are not so directly interested in these matters as\r\n    are we, but also that when one wishes to make a suggestion\r\n    to his own section he naturally prefers to do so through a\r\n    publication in that section.\r\n\r\n    Some of our newspapers have done creditable work through their\r\n    editorial columns, but an editor cannot be a specialist in\r\n    everything. We need, I think, a publication of the nature\r\n    of a magazine whose editors know what to solicit and can\r\n    determine whether or not a contribution meets a need. Such a\r\n    magazine should be free from imitation. With questions of vital\r\n    sectional importance bubbling and seething all around it, there\r\n    is no reason why it should give us stories and treatises in\r\n    competition with Eastern magazines which can pay larger prices\r\n    for such. Finally, its purpose should be for general rather\r\n    than partisan interest.\r\n\r\n    Generally speaking, Southerners seem to me not to be finished\r\n    writers. While some of our newspaper editors have a plain,\r\n    unadorned style which is better than the style of most\r\n    “authors,” nevertheless almost all of us Southerners seem\r\n    troubled with a limited and inaccurate use of the English\r\n    vocabulary. But there are plenty of Southerners who know their\r\n    business and can go to the root of a matter. I believe that\r\n    most readers who are looking for a Southern magazine would\r\n    rather hear from these than from the more finished narrators\r\n    and expounders of nothingness. Finally, a magazine which would\r\n    put a premium on substance told with clearness and brevity, at\r\n    the same time emphasizing the fact that a contribution must\r\n    meet a real need, would have a tendency to develop writers\r\n    whose work possessed style as well as substance.\r\n\r\n    Recently I made the acquaintance of Trotwood’s Magazine, and,\r\n    believing that I noticed in it a strong and sincere inclination\r\n    to be original, the question arose in my mind, Why should not\r\n    this magazine, already in actual operation, become a forum\r\n    for discussing Southern problems? So, if this be Trotwood’s\r\n    purpose, to it I say, may you succeed; and to Tennessee and the\r\n    South, give Trotwood a chance. It may prove to be what you have\r\n    long needed.\r\n\r\n                                                     J. G. SIMS, JR.\r\n\r\n    Nashville, Tenn.\r\n\r\nEditor’s Note.—Trotwood’s thanks Mr. Sims (who, so far, like many of our\r\nreaders and contributors, is a stranger to us) for his kind expressions.\r\nWe learn that he is a graduate of Princeton, and a teacher and writer of\r\nreputation. We agree with him that the South has problems peculiar to\r\nitself, and that the proper place for their discussion is among ourselves\r\nand in a Southern journal. It is the aim and ambition of Trotwood’s to\r\nbe the medium for this as well as for the development of the South’s\r\ngreat resources. We welcome such communications as the above, even if\r\nsome of his plain assertions do grate somewhat on our nerves; for only\r\nby a calm and fair discussion of the problems which confront us can the\r\ntruth be ascertained. Some of Mr. Sims’ assertions above are plainly open\r\nfor discussion, and some are plainly ambiguous. For instance, what does\r\nhe mean by “As to the code of social relations, there are some sections\r\nfertile and penetrated by railroads which are in vital respects half a\r\ncentury behind the advance guard of Anglo-Saxon civilization?” Social\r\nrelations and civilization are two different things, and as to the\r\nformer, it is our opinion that the South, in her fight for the purity of\r\nher race, the integrity of her morals and the hospitality of her people,\r\nsurpasses all other sections of this country. In proof of this I will\r\ncall our esteemed contributor’s attention to the following facts.\r\n\r\n1. The white population of the South, never having been augmented by\r\nforeign immigration to any appreciable extent, is more purely American\r\nthan any other section. It is to-day as it was one hundred years before\r\nthe Revolution. I am not asserting that it is better for this fact,\r\nbut as a matter of “social relations” I am claiming that it is purely\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\n2. The religion of the South is in keeping with the Anglo-Saxon race; it\r\nis the simple religion of the Protestant peoples of England, Scotland\r\nand Wales, the Huguenots of France, and the sturdy, honest Catholics of\r\nIreland. There is less skepticism and less materialism in the South than\r\nin any other section. I consider the above statement appropriate, under\r\nthe head of “social relations.”\r\n\r\n3. There are fewer barrooms in the South than in Greater New York\r\nalone—about 35,000. The South is essentially temperate. This, too, seems\r\nto Trotwood too, under the head of “social relations.”\r\n\r\n4. Lastly (and this will doubtless astonish some of our readers) since\r\nthe half-breed, the grade—the mulatto—is the curse of any nation, whether\r\nwhite, black, red or yellow, every mulatto is a living misfit, whose\r\nmaking is the spoiling of two men—a white man and a black man. Either of\r\nthese, in his ability to accomplish the ends for which he was made, is\r\nfar greater than the cross-bred, this being true in Maine,[1] where there\r\nare no barriers between the social relations of the whites and blacks,\r\nabout two per cent. of the population are negroes, but about 59 per cent.\r\nof her negroes are mulattoes, while in South Caroline, where 59 per cent.\r\nof her people are negroes, only 9.7 per cent. are mulattoes. And it runs\r\nabout that way in the entire country, north, where negroes are permitted\r\nto intermarry with the whites. And if the sturdy white population of the\r\ngrand old State of Maine—the State of such intellectual giants as Blaine,\r\nHale and hosts of others—if this State becomes wholly mulatto, it might\r\nas well be wiped from the map of civilization and be added to Hayti, the\r\nPhilippines and Cuba.\r\n\r\nThis, to Trotwood’s, seems to be an unanswerable argument as to the\r\nsuperiority of the South’s social relations.\r\n\r\nBut this is as we understand social relations. We welcome all\r\ncommunications of thought and progress, but we expect each correspondent\r\nto defend his position and if, on the other hand, our correspondent means\r\nto use social relations and civilization as synonymous, this is another\r\nproposition, and one which, doubtless, he is able to defend.\r\n\r\nThere are other of his premises so painfully true that we repeat them for\r\nemphasis:\r\n\r\n1. “In the realm of economics, most of us in the South have yet to learn\r\nsome of the first principles.” For example, it is said that the thrifty\r\nYankee can live on what the Southerner wastes. And\r\n\r\n2. “As to our courts of justice,” etc.—e.g., where to-day is the old\r\nSouthern lawyer, who held his profession above money, and his opinion\r\nbeyond barter?\r\n\r\n[1] See page 16, Census Bulletin No. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDMUND WINSTON PETTUS.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that any magazine may present to living readers the letter\r\nof a man who has seen four generations arise and pass away. And such a\r\nman!\r\n\r\nEdmund Winston Pettus is one of the great living men of the world. He is\r\nan old Roman who represents the high-water mark of the Republic’s true\r\ngreatness—one who might sit at the council table of the Gracchii, of\r\nPitt, of Washington. I speak not from hearsay—all my life I have known\r\nhim. And never will the Republic look upon his like again, for as he\r\nquotes, “Time changes and men change with it.” But there was a scope, a\r\nbroadness, a breadth and dignity in the Time which reached out to all\r\nthe ages in making the men of his day and generation which seems sadly\r\nlacking to Trotwood’s in making of some of our Southern statesmen of\r\nto-day. But blame not the South for this. She has passed through the\r\nshoals and the rapids of politics since the war. It is natural that much\r\nfroth and foam should follow it. But the two old Romans which Alabama has\r\nsent to the Senate go far to atone for the froth of some of our sister\r\nSouthern States. All honor to Alabama for clinging to such ideals!\r\n\r\nThe picture we present of this grand old man (by courtesy of The Saturday\r\nEvening Post) brings to my mind a flood of remembrance—tender, and of\r\nthe kind which has gone into the soul of me. One morning in the year\r\n1868, when I was too small a boy to go anywhere alone, my father took me\r\nby the hand and led me to the courthouse to hear General Pettus speak. He\r\nturned me over to the sheriff while he himself went on the bench, and the\r\nsheriff placed me in a big chair, and, small as I was, I sat spellbound\r\nunder the thunder of this man’s oratory. It was the first great speech I\r\nhad ever heard.\r\n\r\nAnd when I see this picture I see the old Judge, before whom he\r\npracticed—the old Judge, my father—who died the oldest judge in the\r\nState, wearing for twenty-six years the ermine and never sullying it.\r\n\r\nThey were men of the same type—men of the Old South—men whom the poet\r\ncalled for, saying:\r\n\r\n    “‘God give us men. A time like this demands\r\n    Strong minds, great hearts, true faith and ready hands;\r\n      Men whom the love of office cannot kill;\r\n    Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;\r\n      Men who possess opinions and a will;\r\n    Men who have honor; men who will not lie;\r\n      Men who can stand before a demagogue\r\n    And damn his treacherous flatteries without winking!\r\n      Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog\r\n    In public duty and in private thinking—\r\n      For while the rabble with their thumb-worn creeds,\r\n      Their large professions and their little deeds,\r\n      Mingle in selfish strife, lo! Freedom weeps,\r\n      Wrong rules the land, and waiting justice sleeps.”\r\n\r\nThe Saturday Evening Post, in its issue of March 17th, says this of\r\nSenator Pettus: “It isn’t much of a trick to be eighty-five years\r\nyoung, but to be a vigorous and virile senator at eighty-five is an\r\naccomplishment. Few men have done that. Edmund Winston Pettus, of Alabama\r\nis one. One is reminded of a buffalo when Pettus comes into the Senate\r\nchamber. He has shoulders a yard across and a barrel of a chest upholding\r\na short, thick neck and a massive head. When he walks he holds his\r\nhead forward and shakes it slowly from side to side. It is fascinating\r\nto watch the sturdy old man and speculate how strong he was when he was\r\nyoung. He left Selma with a party of neighbors at the beginning of the\r\ngold excitement and rode horseback to California. He carried a Bible and\r\na copy of Shakespeare in his saddle-bags and read them while on horseback\r\nand by the light of the camp fires at night. The Senator asserts that no\r\nbetter library has been taken there since. Pettus was a lieutenant in the\r\nMexican War and a brigadier-general in the Confederate Army in the Civil\r\nWar. There is a big, sprawling painting of the battle of Chepultepec over\r\none of the stairways in the Senate wing of the Capitol. A few days ago a\r\nman was studying the picture. Senator Pettus came along.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Edmund Winston Pettus.]\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the man, “I observe that you are an old man. Will you kindly\r\ntell me if the people of those days wore clothes like those in the\r\npicture there?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” thundered Pettus, “they did not! I was in that battle, and I\r\nsaw no such clothes as those. So far as that raiment is concerned that\r\nrepresentation is a mere pictorial lie!”\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that from one section of Alabama—the Black Belt—and from\r\none town in it—Selma—should have come two such men as Pettus and Morgan,\r\nboth now octogenarians, and the same intellectual giants they were a half\r\ncentury ago.\r\n\r\nIn a near issue of Trotwood’s, perhaps in the next number, will be told\r\nthe story of that section—a section rich not only in sturdy, progressive\r\npeople, but in a soil and climate of such great natural advantages that\r\nthe mere telling of it will be a revelation to those who have not heard\r\nof it before.\r\n\r\n    Mr. John Trotwood Moore, Columbia, Tenn.—My Dear Sir: I\r\n    received your letter and the magazines you sent me. I read\r\n    carefully your article on what Parton calls “The murder of\r\n    Dickinson,” and I enjoyed it very much. I have always thought\r\n    that people who live in this age give too much importance to\r\n    questions of right and wrong, to what I call “modern ideas,”\r\n    or, rather, who attach too little importance to the theories of\r\n    the former generations. I have lived through four generations\r\n    complete, and there have been in my day marvelous changes\r\n    in public opinion, and even the established theories in the\r\n    churches as to whether a certain thing is right or wrong. When\r\n    I was a boy in North Alabama instrumental music in a church\r\n    was considered as a sacrilege, and was not allowed under\r\n    any circumstances. Duelling was not more condemned than the\r\n    resenting of an insult in any other way, and the old saying is\r\n    perfectly true, “Times change and we change with them.” In your\r\n    article about the duel you failed to notice that Mrs. Jackson,\r\n    with her first husband, resided in Kentucky, but Kentucky was\r\n    then a part of Virginia.\r\n\r\n    In my young days I was familiar with the Hermitage grounds.\r\n    For four years I was a student at what was then called Clinton\r\n    College, which was in Smith County, between Carthage and\r\n    Alexandria, and about forty miles east of the Hermitage on the\r\n    old emigrant road from Knoxville to Nashville. I visited the\r\n    Hermitage on several occasions. My grandfather lived for many\r\n    years about a mile from the Hermitage, and General Jackson\r\n    attended the marriage of my father and mother, and my father\r\n    and several of my uncles went with General Jackson through the\r\n    Creek War.\r\n\r\n    In 1840 I went from Clinton College to attend the Nashville\r\n    convention, in what has been called “the log cabin and hard\r\n    cider” campaign, and we stopped at the Hermitage to see General\r\n    Jackson. Whilst we were sitting with a number of persons on the\r\n    piazza the East Tennessee delegates to the Whig convention, in\r\n    vast numbers, passed on the pike in front of the house. One\r\n    party of them had a small cannon, and when they reached the\r\n    front gate, then about two hundred yards from the house, they\r\n    brought the cannon inside the gate and fired on the house, with\r\n    blank cartridges, of course. This created great indignation\r\n    throughout Tennessee. I did attend the convention. The\r\n    principal purpose of the students in attending the convention\r\n    was to hear Henry Clay; and we did hear him. It was as poor a\r\n    speech as I ever heard from any man reputed to be a speaker.\r\n    The speech was not more than ten minutes long, and the best\r\n    part of it was a fling at Felix Grundy. Mr. Clay said that\r\n    when he reached Nashville he inquired for his old friend, the\r\n    Hon. Felix Grundy, and that he learned “that he was at his old\r\n    trade in East Tennessee defending criminals.” Mr. Grundy was\r\n    then making political speeches in East Tennessee for Mr. Van\r\n    Buren and the Democrats. You remember that Mr. Clay was beaten\r\n    for the nomination a few weeks before by General Harrison, and\r\n    his whole speech and demeanor on that occasion indicated great\r\n    sourness and dissatisfaction, and did him much injury with his\r\n    party.\r\n\r\n    I was much gratified to see from your letter that you remember\r\n    how your father, the late Judge John Moore, and I were for so\r\n    many years fast and devoted friends. Most respectfully, your\r\n    friend,\r\n\r\n                                                       E. W.

For these things are transient,\r\nwhile truth is eternal.

In the May number you speak of\r\n    New England sitting sullenly, secretly aiding the enemy and\r\n    watching for a chance to secede. As a descendant of New England\r\n    parents, I must protest. Whatever may have been the sins of New\r\n    England, secession was not one. Not all of New England favored\r\n    the War of 1812, but that isn’t secession. Men were killed\r\n    in Baltimore, Md., because they opposed the war, but no one\r\n    accused Baltimore of secession. Write for the whole country and\r\n    not for a section.\r\n\r\n                              Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                                      E. D. PRESTON.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we know Dr. Preston, the writer of the above, and remembered\r\nmost pleasantly that he stopped off once to see us in his journeyings\r\nSouth. He is a gentleman and a man of much intelligence, and we must make\r\ngood our assertions or acknowledge we have erred.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Thomas Jefferson was elected to the Presidency in 1800, New England\r\nregarded it just as the South did Lincoln’s election sixty years later—as\r\na fit cause for secession. John Quincy Adams published a statement over\r\nhis own signature in which he said that in the winter of 1803, a plot was\r\nformed in New England to separate from the Union: “The plan,” he says,\r\n“was so far matured, that a proposal had been made to an individual to\r\npermit himself, at the proper time, to be placed at the head of military\r\nmovements which, it would be foreseen, would be necessary to carry the\r\nproject into successful execution.” Again, he says: “The separation of\r\nthe Union was openly stimulated in the public prints, and a convention of\r\ndelegates of the New England States, to meet at New Haven, was proposed.”\r\nThis is the same gentleman who was the sixth President of the United\r\nStates, but who, before that event, was forced to retire to private\r\nlife by his New England constituency for voting with the Jefferson\r\nAdministration in laying an embargo on all shipping in American ports in\r\nretaliation for the insults of England. “The great damage fell upon the\r\nmaritime States of New England, and there the vials of Federalist wrath\r\nwere poured forth with terrible fury upon Mr. Jefferson and the embargo.\r\nBut the full measure of their ferocity was reserved for the Adams,” etc.\r\n(Appleton’s Enc. of Am. Biography, Vol. I., p. 25.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGovernor Wolcott, of Connecticut, said: “I sincerely declare that I wish\r\nthe Northern States would separate from the Southern the moment Jefferson\r\nis elected.”\r\n\r\nAnd Governor Plummer, of New Hampshire, declared in 1805 that it was the\r\npurpose of certain distinguished New Englanders “to dissolve the Union.”\r\n\r\nJames Millhouse, U.

Senator from Connecticut, said: “The Eastern\r\nStates must and will dissolve the Union and form a separate government of\r\ntheir own, and the sooner they do it the better.”\r\n\r\nJonah Quincy, on the floor of Congress: “I am compelled to declare, as my\r\ndeliberate opinion, that if this bill (to admit Louisiana) passes, the\r\nbonds of the Union are virtually dissolved; that the States which compose\r\nit are hereby freed from the moral obligations, and that, as it will be\r\nthe right of all, so it will be the duty of some to prepare definitely\r\nfor the separation, amicably, if we can; forcibly, if we must.” When he\r\nwas called to order for this by Poindexter, of Mississippi, who proposed\r\na vote of censure by the House, the House sustained Quincy and let him\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJulian Hawthorne, in his “History of the United States,” says: “In the\r\nWar of 1812, our antagonists were many. First, we had to fight the New\r\nEngland Federalists.” Again, he says: “Connecticut went so far as to\r\nraise a separate army for the defense of her own domain—whether against\r\nEngland or America might be left to decide.” (U. S. History, p. 709.) And\r\nagain, he tells that by a system of blue light signals the New England\r\nFederalists kept the English fleet informed of the plan of our troops,\r\nthereby greatly aiding the enemy and embarrassing our movements. “Thus,”\r\nhe says, “the Blue Light Federalists secured for themselves a place of\r\ninfamy in our annals.”\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of Massachusetts declared that no power was given to\r\nthe President or to Congress to declare war or to levy troops; that\r\nonly to the States did they belong; and thereupon the Governor of that\r\nState refused the request of the President for its quota to defend\r\ntheir coast. When the New England members who voted for the War of 1812\r\nreturned home, they were reviled, denounced and one of them actually\r\nkicked and cuffed by a mob in historic Plymouth. The Federalists of\r\nNew England prevented the Government’s every effort to raise money or\r\ntroops. Finally, on December 15, 1814, when Jackson was moving heaven\r\nand earth to save New Orleans, a New England Convention, “summoned by\r\nState authority, assembled at Hartford, Connecticut, whose object was to\r\nsecure armed resistance and overthrow of the Union.... This convention\r\nwas attended by twenty-six delegates, all respectable, cultivated\r\ngentlemen.” (Hawthorne’s U. S. History, p. 731.) “It was composed of\r\ntwelve delegates from Massachusetts, seven from Connecticut, four from\r\nRhode Island (appointed by the legislatures of these States), and two\r\nfrom New Hampshire, and one from Vermont (appointed by counties), all\r\nFederalists.... Its proceedings were carried on in secret, and the\r\nconvention was suspected at the time of treason.” (Cent. Dict., Vol.\r\nIX., p. 484.) In their declaration this convention said: “But in cases\r\nof deliberate, dangerous and palpable infraction of the Constitution,\r\naffecting the sovereignty of a State and liberties of a people, it is not\r\nonly the right but the duty of such a State to interpose its authority\r\nfor their protection in the manner best calculated to secure that end.\r\nWhen emergencies occur which are either beyond the reach of the judicial\r\ntribunals or too pressing to admit of the delay incident to their forms,\r\nStates which have no common umpire must be their own judges and execute\r\ntheir own decisions.” (Niles Register, Vol. VII., p. 306.)\r\n\r\nThis was the view taken by the Southern States when they seceded in\r\n1861, and which the great Civil War decided in the negative forever, not\r\nas a question of right nor of wrong, but as a policy of a majority of the\r\npeople of this country, in arms assembled and on the field of battle.\r\n\r\n“Whatever may have been the sins of New England, secession was not\r\none,” says our correspondent. In proving that our friend is mistaken\r\nin his facts, I take the liberty also of defending New England as to\r\nhis assertion that this was a sin. It certainly was not a sin. The\r\nNew England States had this right, as did every State up to its final\r\nsettlement by arms in 1861-5. It were no more a sin then than for New\r\nEngland to vote for McKinley and the gold standard in 1896, or for\r\nthe South to vote for Bryan and silver. There can be no sin in a mere\r\nquestion of national policy by any people or peoples. “Not all of New\r\nEngland favored the War of 1812, but that is not secession,” he adds, as\r\nthe gist of his argument.\r\n\r\nThat is true—neither did all the South favor secession in 1860-61.\r\nPerhaps it may be interesting to relate here that Tennessee, on the\r\nonly vote taken by her as to whether it should be secession or not,\r\nvoted by nearly 60,000 majority against secession. Afterwards, Governor\r\nHarris and the Legislature declared her out of the Union. Perhaps it\r\nmay be still more of interest when I say that although the South sent\r\nfully 600,000 troops into the war to battle for States’ rights, she sent\r\nnearly 400,000 to fight on the other side. But everybody knows that a\r\nmajority of the Southern people were for seceding and the foundation of\r\nour esteemed correspondent’s argument is gone when I assert, as I can\r\nprove, that from the election of Jefferson to the Battle of New Orleans,\r\nthe majority of the people of New England, as voiced in the Federalist\r\nvote, were opposed to the policy of Jefferson, to War of 1812, and but\r\nfor the Treaty of Ghent and the Battle of New Orleans would have voted to\r\nsecede. In conclusion, let me say, those questions are all settled—“those\r\nfar-off, old, unhappy days.” But the truth, at all times, should be\r\nprecious, for among its many crowning glories, it teaches us that man is\r\nnot very different from his neighbor after all. In 1898, at the outbreak\r\nof the Spanish War, and when the United States troops had rendezvoused on\r\nChickamauga battlefield, before marching into Cuba, Tennessee unveiled\r\nher statue erected to both her soldiers of the Blue and the Gray who died\r\nthere. The writer was asked to read the dedicatory poem. On the stage\r\nwere General Wheeler, General Stewart and many distinguished soldiers of\r\nboth armies. And thus was the poem read:\r\n\r\n                      REUNITED.\r\n\r\n    By steel-sheathed ship and iron gun\r\n      And forts that frown on a crouching sea,\r\n    Like a reef-split wave in the mad ebb’s run,\r\n      Like the foam, rock stopped, from the driven lea,\r\n    They have halted their butchering lines of red,\r\n      For a star-flung banner has published a ban:\r\n    Let the Past be past, let the dead be dead—\r\n      Now and forever, American.\r\n\r\n    It has girdled the depths of our heart’s red blood,\r\n      It has welded our chain in a white-heat fire,\r\n    And the Gray has come with the old-time flood,\r\n      And the Blue stands firm in the old-time fire.\r\n    And starving eyes, whence Hope had fled\r\n      Look up where the light of the message ran:\r\n    Let the Past be past, let the dead be dead—\r\n      Now and forever, American.\r\n\r\n    O, valorous Gray, in the grave of your fate!\r\n      Oh, valorous Blue, in the long deady ears!\r\n    Ye were sown in sorrow and harrowed in Hate,\r\n      But your harvest to-day is a nation’s tears,\r\n    For the message you left through the land has sped\r\n      From the lips of God to the heart of man:\r\n    Let the Past be past, let the dead be dead—\r\n      Now and forever, American.\r\n\r\n                                   JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE.",
