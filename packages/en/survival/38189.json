Those who have attended to the subject well\r\nknow, that the profitable management of live-stock is by far the most\r\ndifficult branch of farming, as it is here that improvement is\r\npeculiarly tardy; and from this we might infer that authors would\r\nendeavour so to arrange and simplify their treatises as to enable\r\nevery one to obtain the bearings of the study at the smallest possible\r\nexpense and trouble. Such, however, is not the case. Many would appear\r\nto have done their best so to dilute and mystify the little which is\r\nknown about the matter, that it is nearly impossible for any one, not\r\ngifted with more than ordinary power of application, to arrive at any\r\nthing like just conclusions. To avoid this error has been my object in\r\nthe following pages. Such points only as are of real importance have\r\nbeen noticed; every thing having been rejected which could not admit\r\nof a practical application. For this reason, also, I have omitted all\r\nallusion to foreign _varieties_ of the sheep, an account of which is,\r\nin some similar works, made to occupy so large a space. The general\r\nlaws by which animal bodies are governed, and the changes to which\r\nthey are rendered liable by their subserviency to man, are here--and\r\nfor the first time as regards the sheep--gone into at considerable\r\nlength. Too little value is in general attached to such inquiries;\r\nthough, when endeavouring to improve a domesticated race, we must be\r\nperfectly aware, that without this species of knowledge we are like a\r\nship at sea without the guiding aids of the rudder and the compass,\r\nand liable to be carried in the right or in the wrong direction only\r\nas chance directs.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I need make no apology for any defects that may appear\r\nin this little work, having done my best to make it useful to the\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\nCASTLE STREET, DUMFRIES,\r\n\r\n_July, 1838_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE                                                           iii\r\n\r\nReferences to the Plates                                           xi\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE SHEEP.\r\n\r\n(1) Origin of the Sheep;--(2) The Argali of Siberia and Mouflon\r\nof Sardinia;--(3) The Mouflon of America;--(4) The Mouflon of\r\nAfrica;--(5) British Breeds;--(6) The Lincolnshire;--(7) The\r\nTeeswater;--(8) The Dishley or New Leicester;--(9) The Devonshire\r\nNots;--(10) The Dorsetshire Sheep;--(11) Herefordshire or Ryeland\r\nSheep;--(12) The South Down;--(13) The Cheviot Sheep;--(14) Mugg\r\nSheep;--(15) The Black-faced or Heath Sheep;--(16) The Merino;--\r\n(17) Teeth of Sheep;--(18) Distinctions between the Sheep and Goat;\r\n--(19) Horns of Sheep;--(20) Structure of the Stomach;--(21)\r\nDigestion;--(22) Period of Conception;--(23) Names applied to\r\nSheep                                                               1\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWOOL.\r\n\r\n(24) Wool-bearing Animals;--(25) Structure of the Skin;--(26)\r\nSebaceous follicles;--(27) Connexion of the Hair with the\r\nSkin--Yolk;--(28) Periodical decidence of Wool;--(29) Falling off\r\nof Wool prevented by Clipping;--(30) Form of Woolly Fibre;--(31)\r\nStructure and Properties of Hair and Wool;--(32) Particular soils\r\ninjurious to Wool;--(33) Felting;--(34) Different kinds of\r\nWool;--(35) Alterations caused by _Crossing_;--(36) Bratting\r\nprejudicial to Wool                                                16\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nBRITISH WOOL TRADE.\r\n\r\n(37) Origin of the Wool Trade;--(38) Invention of Weaving;--(39)\r\nEarly progress of the Wool Trade;--(40) Introduction of Weaving into\r\nBritain;--(41) Importance of the British Woollen Manufacture;--(42)\r\nWeavers brought by Edward III. from Flanders;--(43) Regulations\r\nregarding _Staples_;--(44) Rapid advance of the Wool Trade in\r\nthe 14th century;--(45) Subsidies raised by Edward III.;--(46)\r\nProgress of the Wool Trade during the reigns of Henry VII., Henry\r\nVIII., and Edward VI.;--(47) Encouragement given by Elizabeth\r\nto the Trade;--(48) Woollen Cloth monopolized by the Merchant\r\nAdventurers;--(49) Consumption of Wool in England increased;--\r\n(50) Severity of the Prohibitory Enactments relating to Wool\r\nreprobated;--(51) Emigration of English families to Holland, and\r\nProsperity of the Dutch Manufactures;--(52) Fluctuating state of\r\nthe Trade between 1635 and 1698;--(53) King William discourages\r\nthe Irish manufactures;--(54) Statistics of the British Wool\r\nTrade in 1699;--(55) British Woollen Manufacturers rivalled by\r\nthe Swedes;--(56) Regulations relating to Wool from 1740 to 1742;\r\n--(57) Impulse given to the Trade by the improvements in Machinery;\r\n--(57) Commencement of the 19th century;

Into these arguments, however, it would be absurd to enter; I\r\nshall therefore content myself with such opinions as are deemed the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nPlaced in the Class Mammalia, and Order Ruminantia, the innumerable\r\nvarieties at present existing may, according to Cuvier, whose tact in\r\narranging animals is universally acknowledged, all be referred to four\r\nspecies--the Argali of Siberia, the Mouflon of Sardinia, the Mouflon\r\nof America, and the Mouflon of Africa--though to be rigidly accurate\r\nin natural distinctions he would refer them all to three, thereby\r\nexcluding the third.\r\n\r\n(2.) _The Argali of Siberia_ (_Ovis Ammon_) inhabits the mountains of\r\nAsia, where it attains the size of a fallow deer. The male has very\r\nlarge horns, with three rounded angles at the base, flattened in\r\nfront, and striated transversely. The horns of the female are\r\ncompressed, and hook-shaped. The hair is short in summer, and of a\r\nfawn-coloured grey; in winter it is thick, rigid, and of a reddish\r\ngrey, with some white about the muzzle, throat, and under the belly.\r\nThe Mouflon of Sardinia (_Ovis Musimon_, Fig. 1. Pl. I.) differs from\r\nit only in its inferior size, and in the smallness of the horns of the\r\nfemale.\r\n\r\n(3.) _The Mouflon of America_ (_Ovis Montana_) closely resembles the\r\nArgali, and is supposed by some to be identical with it, and to have\r\ncrossed from Asia to America at Behring's Straits by means of ice.\r\n\r\n(4.) _The Mouflon of Africa_ (_Ovis Tragelaphus_) is distinguished by\r\nits soft and reddish hair, by its short tail, and by a long mane\r\nhanging under the neck, and another at each ancle; it inhabits the\r\nrocky districts of Barbary, and has been observed in Egypt.\r\n\r\n(5.) _British Breeds._--The breeds of our island, as they at present\r\nstand, may be divided into two kinds--long-woolled and short-woolled;\r\nthe former embracing the Lincolnshire, the Teeswater, the Dishley, or\r\nNew Leicester, and the Devonshire Nots; while the latter will include\r\nthose of Dorset, Herefordshire, and Sussex, with the Cheviot, Mugg,\r\nand Black-faced variety.[1]\r\n\r\n        [1] Encyclopedia Britannica, 7th Edition, Article Agriculture.\r\n\r\n(6). _The Lincolnshire_ has no horns; the face is white; the carcass\r\nlong and thin; the legs thick, white, and rough; bones large; pelts\r\nthick; and the wool from 8 to 10 inches in length. The ewes weigh from\r\n14 lbs. to 20 lbs. per quarter; and three-year old wethers 20 lbs. to\r\n30 lbs. The fleece weighs from 8 lbs. to 14 lbs., and covers a\r\ncoarse-grained slow-feeding carcass; so slow, indeed, at feeding, that\r\nit cannot be fattened at an early age, except upon rich land; but the\r\nbreed is encouraged, from the great weight of wool that is shorn from\r\nthem every year. It and its sub-varieties are extremely common in the\r\nEnglish counties.\r\n\r\n(7.) _The Teeswater_ sheep were originally bred from the same stock as\r\nthe former, but have become different, from the size having received\r\ngreater attention than the wool, which is inferior both in length and\r\nweight. They stand upon higher and finer boned legs, which support a\r\nfirmer and heavier carcass, much wider upon the back and sides, and\r\nafford a fatter and finer-grained mutton--the two-year-old wethers\r\nweighing from 25 lbs. to 30 lbs. per quarter. Marshall, in his work on\r\nYorkshire, remarks, that they are not so compact, nor so complete in\r\ntheir form, as the Leicestershire sheep; nevertheless, the excellency\r\nof their flesh and fatting quality is not doubted, and their wool\r\nstill remains superior. For the banks of the Tees, or any other rich\r\nfat land, they are singularly excellent.\r\n\r\n(8.) _The Dishley_, or _New Leicester_, is distinguished from other\r\nlong-woolled breeds, by clean heads, straight broad flat backs, round\r\nbodies, small bones, thin pelts, and a disposition to fatten at an\r\nearly age. But more of this hereafter. The weight of three-year-old\r\newes is from 18 lbs. to 26 lbs. per quarter; and of two-year old\r\nwethers from 20 lbs. to 30 lbs. The wool averages from 6 lbs. to 8\r\nlbs., and is thought by some to be inferior in quality to that of\r\nCheviot sheep; but, from being fully fed at all seasons, they yield\r\ngreat quantities of it. Fig. 1. Pl. III.\r\n\r\n(9.) _The Devonshire Nots_ form the fourth hornless variety of\r\nlong-woolled sheep. Forty or fifty years ago, they ranked as\r\nmiddle-woolled sheep; but they now figure among the long-wools, under\r\nthe name of Bamptons--their fleece having been lengthened, and\r\nrendered finer, by crossing with the Leicesters. There is yet,\r\nhowever, much room for improvement in these crosses. They have white\r\nfaces and legs, the latter being short, and the bones large, while the\r\nnecks are thick, the backs high, and the sides good. They approach in\r\nweight to the Leicester, but the wool is heavier and coarser. In\r\nDevonshire are found a white-faced and horned variety, which are known\r\nas the Exmoor kind, from the place of their nativity. Though delicate\r\nin bone, they are not good, having a narrow flat-sided carcass; while\r\nthe weight of the quarters and fleece is a third short of the former\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\n(10.) _The Dorsetshire sheep_ are horned and white-faced, with a long\r\nthin carcass, and high small white legs. Three-year-old wethers weigh\r\nfrom 16 lbs. to 20 lbs. a quarter; but the wool, being fine and short,\r\nweighs only from 3 lbs. to 4 lbs. a fleece. It is, however, amply\r\ncompensated for by the mutton, which is of superior quality. The\r\npeculiar and most valuable property of this breed is the forwardness\r\nof the ewes, which take the ram at any period of the year, often\r\nlambing, so early as September or October. They are, on this account,\r\nextremely useful for supplying large towns with house-lamb at\r\nChristmas. Fig. 1, Pl. II.\r\n\r\n(11.) _Herefordshire_ or _Ryeland sheep_ have white legs and faces,\r\nand no horns. The wool grows close to the eyes. They are a small\r\nbreed, suited to every market, weighing from 12 lbs. to 16 lbs.\r\na-quarter. The carcass is tolerably well-formed, and the wool fine and\r\nshort, each fleece weighing from 1-1/2 lb. to 2-1/2 lbs., rarely,\r\nhowever, exceeding 2 lbs. They were called _Ryeland_ sheep, from a\r\ndistrict in the southern part of Herefordshire being thought capable\r\nof growing nothing but rye. Though their figure is good, the back is\r\nnot so level, nor the ribs so well rounded, as in the improved breeds.\r\nThey fatten easily, however, and arrive soon at maturity, though\r\nreckoned inferior in these respects to the Cheviot variety.\r\n\r\n(12.) _The South Down_, like the Ryeland, are, from the delicacy of\r\ntheir constitution, unadapted for bleak situations, but sufficiently\r\nhardy and active for a low country; their average weight is from 15\r\nlbs. to 18 lbs. a-quarter; that of the fleece, which is very short and\r\nfine, being from 2-1/2 lbs. to 3 lbs. They are without horns, have\r\ngrey faces and legs, a neck low set and small, and a breast neither\r\nwide nor deep; their mutton is fine in the grain, and of an excellent\r\nflavour, having been brought to great perfection by Mr Ellman of\r\nGlynd, and other intelligent breeders. They are mostly found in\r\nSussex, on dry chalky downs producing short fine herbage, and arrive\r\nearly at maturity; in which respect they are equal to the Cheviot,\r\nthough inferior to them in quantity of tallow. Formerly they would not\r\ntake on fat till four years old; now they are always at market when\r\nabout two years of age, and many are killed before that period. Fig.\r\n2. Pl. II.\r\n\r\n(13.) _The Cheviot Sheep_ have a bare head, with a long jaw, and white\r\nface, but no horns. Sometimes they have a shade of grey upon the nose,\r\napproaching to dark at the tip; at others, a tinge of lemon colour on\r\nthe face, but these markings scarcely affect their value. The legs are\r\nclean, long, and small-boned, and covered with wool to the hough; but\r\nthere is a sad want of depth at the breast, and of breadth both there\r\nand on the chine. A fat carcass weighs from 12 lbs. to 18 lbs. per\r\nquarter, and a medium fleece about 3 lbs. The purest specimens of this\r\nbreed are to be found on the Scotch side of the Cheviot hills, and on\r\nthe high and stony mountain-farms which lie between that range and the\r\nsource of the Teviot. These sheep are a capital mountain stock,\r\nprovided the pasture resembles the Cheviot hills, in containing a good\r\nproportion of rich herbage. Fig. 2. Pl. III.\r\n\r\n(14.) _Mugg Sheep._--\"In this variety,\" says Dr Fleming, in his\r\nHistory of British Animals, \"the face and legs are white, or rarely\r\nspotted with yellow, and the forehead covered with long wool. This is\r\nthe native breed in Scotland, to the north of the Forth and Clyde.\r\nThey are of small size, and seldom weigh above 8 or 10 lbs. per\r\nquarter. Some tribes have horns; others are destitute of them, and\r\nthey vary in the length of the tail. They may be considered as the\r\nstock of the numerous modern and valuable varieties, which are bred in\r\nthe best cultivated districts. The Shetland sheep belongs to this\r\nkind. The fur consists of firm wool next the skin, with long coarse\r\nhairs, indications of an inhabitant of an arctic climate.\"\r\n\r\n(15.) _The Black-faced or Heath Sheep_ are known by their large spiral\r\nhorns, wild-looking eyes, black legs and faces, with short firm\r\ncarcasses, covered by long coarse wool, which weighs from 3 lbs. to 4\r\nlbs. As the form of this sheep has lately been much improved, by\r\ninducing a short and round carcass, they have acquired the name of\r\n_short_ sheep, in contradistinction to the Cheviots, which are termed\r\nlong sheep. When three years old, they fatten well, affording\r\nexcellent highly-flavoured mutton, and weighing from 10 lbs. to 16\r\nlbs. a-quarter. They are the most valuable upland sheep in Britain,\r\nabounding in all the western counties of England and Scotland, and are\r\nnow becoming great favourites in the London market. Fig. 1. Pl. IV.\r\n\r\n(16.) _The Merino._--Though many foreign breeds have from time to time\r\nappeared in this country, yet almost all of them have been viewed\r\nmerely as objects of curiosity, and, as such, have speedily been\r\ndisregarded. Far different, however, was the reception of the Merinos.\r\nBrought into England under the most favourable auspices, and placed at\r\nonce under the fostering protection of royalty, their native merits\r\ncould not but be speedily appreciated and diffused throughout the\r\nkingdom. They have received the name of _Merino_ from a peculiar buff\r\nor reddish hue of the countenance, and are supposed to have come\r\noriginally from Africa; at least Marcus Columella, having seen a\r\nstrange variety from that country exhibited at Rome, during some\r\npublic games or shows, took them to his farm, and, having crossed them\r\nwith the breeds of Tarentum, sent the offspring to Spain. There they\r\nthrove remarkably, attracting the attention of other nations, to whom\r\nthey were from time to time exported, and at present may be found in\r\nalmost every part of the world.\r\n\r\nMerinos were brought to England for the first time in 1788, but\r\nattracted little attention, owing to the want of rams. Lord Somerville\r\nwent to Portugal in 1801, for the purpose of selecting such animals as\r\nappeared valuable, from uniting a good carcass with a superior fleece,\r\nand he succeeded, notwithstanding the disturbed state of the country,\r\nin obtaining specimens, which called forth the praises of the\r\nshepherds, through whose travelling flocks they passed. Public\r\nattention was attracted to them on the commencement of his Majesty's\r\nsales in 1804; and their distribution over the country was\r\naccomplished in 1811, by the formation of the principal landed\r\nproprietors and eminent breeders into a Merino Society.\r\n\r\nThe Merinos had much prejudice to encounter on being first brought\r\nbefore the public in 1804; but they soon rose in favour and value, and\r\nsteadily progressed till the Merino Society was established, when,\r\nstrange though it may appear, all these advantages were at once\r\ndestroyed. This paradox may, perhaps, be explained, by supposing that\r\nthe institution of local committees, which immediately followed,\r\nallowed the enemies of the change, in distant parts of the kingdom,\r\nample opportunity of striking at the scheme, now that it was\r\nentrusted, in many instances, to persons ill qualified for the task\r\neither of making converts, or retaining the advantages already gained.\r\n\r\nThe horns of the Merino are of large size, twisted spirally and\r\nextended laterally, approaching closely in these characters to the\r\nsheep of Mount Parnassus, a specimen of which is delineated in the\r\nwork by E. T. Bennett, on the Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological\r\nSociety. The face has a characteristic velvety appearance, but the\r\ncheeks and forehead are disfigured by coarse hair. The legs are long\r\nand small in the bone; the breast and back are narrow, the sides flat,\r\nand too much of the weight is expended on the coarser parts. There is\r\na peculiar looseness of skin beneath the throat, which is admired in\r\nSpain as denoting a tendency to weight and fineness of wool, though\r\nregarded in this country as a sign of a bad skin and want of aptitude\r\nto fatten. The average weight of the fleece in Spain is, 8 lbs. from\r\nthe ram, and 5 lbs. from the ewe. The abundance of the yolk enables\r\nthe wool to detain all the filth which comes in contact with it, so\r\nmuch so, that by washing the weight is diminished about three-fifths.\r\nThe fibre of the wool is finer than that of any other sheep, and the\r\ncarcass, when fat, averages from 12 lbs. to 16 lbs. a-quarter. They\r\nare quiet and tractable, and possessed of many good qualities, but\r\nthey are liable to abortion, are bad nurses, and require a large\r\nsupply of food, for which, owing to an unprofitable form, they yield\r\nno return. Fig. 2. Pl. IV.\r\n\r\nThe Merinos were at one time in great request in various countries,\r\nfrom a supposition that they would speedily supplant other breeds; but\r\nthis has never been the case, as the animal soon degenerates when out\r\nof Spain, and is only valuable so far as giving rise to varieties,\r\nwhich are equal, if not superior to itself. Large profits were at\r\nfirst expected from their wool, but these were reduced to a trifle\r\nwhen the loss of weight, and fineness in the carcass were taken into\r\naccount. Mr Hose of Melton Mowbray, put a certain number of Leicester\r\newes to a ram of the same breed, and an equal number to a merino ram.\r\nThe result was, that the Leicester fleece weighed 7 lbs., and the one\r\nfrom the cross with the merino, 8 lbs.; and that the former brought in\r\nthe market 1s. per lb., and the latter 1s. 6d., being a gain of 5s. on\r\nthe fleece. The carcass of the former, however, weighed 27 lbs. per\r\nquarter, and the latter only 25 lbs., being a loss of 5 lbs. on\r\nmutton. Much advantage may, however, be expected from our crosses with\r\nthe Saxon merino, which is in every respect well suited to our notions\r\nof a fine animal, as it yields a good wool, and is little inferior in\r\ncarcass to some of our best breeds.\r\n\r\n(17.) _Teeth of Sheep._--In common with the rest of the ruminating\r\nanimals, sheep have eight incisors in the lower jaw, unopposed by any\r\nin the upper, a callous pad, which is substituted, being attached to\r\nthe distal end of the intermaxillarv bones. Between the incisors and\r\nmolars, or grinding teeth, there is a vacant space of about an inch\r\nand a half. There are twenty-four molars, six on each side of each\r\njaw; their crowns are marked with two double crescents, the convexity\r\nof which is turned inwards in the upper, and outwards in the lower\r\njaw. The lamb, when newly dropped, is devoid of incisor teeth, though\r\nthe two central ones are occasionally above the gum even at this early\r\nperiod. When one month old, the first set of incisive teeth are\r\ncomplete. The two fore-teeth of the under jaw drop out at the end of\r\nthe first year; six months after the two next to these are lost; and\r\nat the end of five years the teeth are all renewed. When the permanent\r\nteeth are fully grown, it is almost impossible to ascertain the age of\r\nthe animal, as the soil, the texture of the provender, and the\r\noriginal form of the teeth, have all a greater or less influence over\r\ntheir durability.\r\n\r\n(18.) _Distinctions between the Sheep and Goat._--Though a comparison\r\nof the most common domesticated breeds of sheep and goats, tends to\r\nconfirm the broad distinctions drawn between them, yet these\r\ndifferences almost entirely disappear, when we attempt to define the\r\ncharacteristics of those races, which still exist in a wild state in\r\nvarious parts of both Continents, where it is so far impossible to\r\ndetermine the precise division to which they belong, that Cuvier holds\r\nthem unworthy of a generic separation. Sheep and goats, in fact, agree\r\nin so many points as regards structure, form, stature, and habit, that\r\nwere it not that sheep, according to that naturalist, have \"their\r\nhorns directed backwards, returning more or less forwards in a spiral\r\nmanner, with a generally convex line of profile, and no beard,\" while\r\nthe goats have \"their horns directed upwards and backwards, their\r\nchins generally decorated with a long beard, and their line of profile\r\nalmost always concave,\" there would hardly exist a difference worth\r\nthe noting. Some writers place great reliance on the differences\r\nindicated by the different coverings of the animals, ascribing wool to\r\nthe sheep, and hair to the goat, forgetting that most of the wild\r\nsheep, and some of the domesticated races, are covered with hair,\r\nwhile some goats, as those of Thibet and Angora, are remarkable for\r\nthe fineness of their wool. Even supposing these distinctions to hold\r\ngood, we have still to combat the fact, that _sheep and goats produce\r\nmongrels capable of reproduction_, a consideration sufficient of\r\nitself to prove, that the sheep and goat can never be made to form the\r\ntypes of separate genera.[2]\r\n\r\n        [2] For further information on this subject, see that\r\n        excellent paper on the Natural History of the Sheep and Goat,\r\n        by James Wilson, Esq. in No. IX. of the Quarterly Journal of\r\n        Agriculture.\r\n\r\n(19.) _Horns of Sheep._--As the Chevrotains or Musks are distinguished,\r\nwith the Camels, from other animals of this order by the absence of\r\nhorns, so are sheep, oxen, goats, and antelopes, distinguished from\r\nthe rest of the horned genera of the order, by the persistence of\r\ntheir frontal prolongations. The horn is an elastic sheath of\r\n_agglutinated hairs_, which appears within the first twelve months,\r\nthough sometimes present at birth, and increases by layers, one being\r\nadded every year, so that the age of a ram may be known by the number\r\nof rings. The ewes have commonly no horns, but only a protuberance in\r\nplace of them. The horn is supported by, and serves to cover, a highly\r\nvascular prolongation of the frontal bone, and it is at its root,\r\nwhere large vessels, and nervous filaments are entering, that blows\r\noccasion so great agony to the animal, apart from the damage which the\r\nother bones sustain by the infliction of violence on so powerful a\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n(20.) _Structure of the Stomach._--The term ruminating, indicates the\r\npower possessed by this animal, in common with many others, of\r\nmasticating its food a second time, by returning it to the mouth after\r\na short maceration. This they are enabled to do, from the structure of\r\nthe stomachs, or, more correctly speaking, stomach; as anatomists have\r\nnow concluded, from all animals being constructed on one common\r\nprinciple, that ruminating animals are not possessed of four stomachs,\r\nas formerly supposed, but only of one, which they view as being\r\ndivided into four compartments. In drawing precise conclusions, we are\r\nbound only to admit the existence of two compartments, the other two\r\nbelonging properly to the gullet; and being equivalent to the cheek\r\npouches of monkeys, or the crop and membranous stomach of birds, may\r\nbe viewed as an apparatus designed to serve a nearly similar purpose\r\n(that of moistening and macerating the food); while the real stomach\r\nwill cease to excite wonder, or puzzle the ignorant, on being\r\ncontrasted with that of other animals, in many of which a division\r\nexists, and from which even the human stomach, though generally a\r\nsingle sac, is not always exempt,--Dr Knox, of Edinburgh, being in\r\npossession of one that resembles a pair of small globes joined by a\r\nnarrow tube, and which, when taken from the body of a person who was\r\nadvanced in life, bore every mark of soundness in texture, and must,\r\ntherefore, have been congenital.\r\n\r\n(21.) _Digestion._[3]--The food descends by the gullet after being\r\npartially crushed, into what is called the first stomach, or paunch,\r\nin Latin, _rumen_, or _ingluvies_, in which cavity are found those\r\nmorbid concretions so much, and so superstitiously, prized in the\r\nEastern world, under the name of Bezoar stones; from this it passes\r\ninto the second, termed bonnet, king's hood, or honey-comb, in Latin\r\n_reticulum_, which is much smaller than the other, and receives its\r\nname from the inner coat being arranged into cells; here it is\r\nmoistened, made into pellets, and, while the animal is at rest,\r\nimpelled by the antiperistaltic motion of the tube to the mouth, and\r\nafter undergoing a complete mastication, is returned through the\r\ngullet to the third stomach, or smallest compartment, which goes under\r\nthe name of _omasum_, or many-plies, from its resembling a rolled up\r\nhedgehog, and sometimes from the longitudinal _laminae_ of its mucous\r\nmembrane that of leaflet. The food remains but a short time in the\r\nomasum, proceeding into the fourth division, or obomasum, which in its\r\nstructure, especially in that of the mucous, or inner membrane, is\r\nnearly allied to the same organ in the human being, and is, by the\r\nFrench, from its power of coagulating milk, called _caillette_. The\r\nlast compartment is the largest of the four, so long as the animal\r\ncontinues to live on milk; but the paunch speedily surpasses it in\r\nmagnitude when grass becomes the sole provision. The milk always\r\npasses at once into the fourth stomach, there being no reason why it\r\nshould be returned.\r\n\r\n        [3] See Figs. 2 and 3, Plate I. with their references.\r\n\r\nThe intestinal canal is long, commencing at the pylorus or lower\r\nopening of the stomach, and averaging from ninety to one hundred feet.\r\nThere are but few enlargements in the great intestines. The fat, like\r\nthat of all ruminating animals, becomes, on cooling, hard and brittle.\r\n\r\n(22.) _Period of Conception._--In this climate, ewes fed on good\r\npastures admit the ram in August; but September or October is the time\r\nwhen such would occur if left to nature. They go with young five\r\nmonths, and in warm climates bring forth thrice a-year; but in\r\nBritain, France, and most of Europe, they do so only once. They give\r\nmilk for seven or eight months; live ten or twelve years; and if well\r\nmanaged, are capable of bringing forth during life, though generally\r\nuseless for that process after the seventh or eighth year. The ram\r\nlives from twelve to fourteen years, though instances are recorded of\r\ntheir enduring till twenty, and becomes unfit for propagating at\r\neight.\r\n\r\n(23.) _Names applied to Sheep._--The age of sheep is never dated from\r\nthe time that they are dropped, as that would be attended with many\r\ninconveniences, but from the time that they are first subjected to the\r\nshears, by which means the first year includes a period of at least\r\nfifteen or sixteen months.\r\n\r\nThe following is a condensed arrangement of the names by which sheep\r\nare designated at different periods of their existence, in various\r\nparts of England and Scotland:--\r\n\r\n                      _From Birth till Weaning._\r\n                 MALE.                           FEMALE.\r\n\r\n  Tup, Ram lamb, Heeder, Pur.     |  Ewe or Gimmer lamb, Chilver.\r\n\r\n                     _From Weaning till first Clip._\r\n\r\n  Hog, Hogget, Hoggerel, Teg.     |  Gimmer hog, Ewe hog, Teg,\r\n    Lamb hog, Tup hog, Gridling,  |    Sheeder ewe, Thrave.\r\n    and, if castrated, a Wether   |\r\n    hog.                          |\r\n\r\n                     _From first to second Clip._\r\n\r\n  Shearling, Shear hog, Heeder,   |  Shearing ewe or gimmer,\r\n    Diamond or Dinmont ram, or    |    Double-toothed ewe or\r\n    tup, and, when castrated, a   |    Teg, Yill gimmer.\r\n    Shearing wether.              |\r\n\r\n                     _From second till third Clip._\r\n\r\n  Two shear ram, young wedder.    |  Two shear ewe, Counter.\r\n\r\n                     _From third till fourth Clip._\r\n\r\n  Three shear ram, old wedder.    |  Three shear ewe, Fronter.\r\n\r\nAnd so on, the name always taking its date from the time of shearing.\r\nBroken-mouthed ewes are called _crones_ in Suffolk and Norfolk;\r\n_kroks_, or _crocks_, in Scotland; and _drapes_ in Lincolnshire. In\r\nScotland, ewes which are neither with lamb, nor giving milk, are said\r\nto be _eild_, or _yield_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\n(24.) _Wool-Bearing Animals._--In most dictionaries wool is defined as\r\nthe fleece of sheep, as if, in fact they were the only animals which\r\nyield it, than which nothing can be more erroneous; since we are\r\nassured by the ablest naturalists, that almost every animal, from the\r\nbutterfly up to man, possesses more or less of this covering, and that\r\nsome indeed rival the sheep in the quantity they bear.\r\n\r\nThough wool is possessed in considerable quantity by carnivorous\r\nanimals, especially bears, yet the herbivorous quadrupeds, never to\r\nmention the sheep, are principally noticed for its growth, and for\r\naffording a commodity which becomes an article of profit in the hands\r\nof some tribes. Heriot, in his travels through Canada, remarks, that\r\n\"the savage women manufacture thread of the wool of the buffalo, and\r\nweave it into cloth. Most parts of the body are invested with a dusky\r\nwool, which is of a quality extremely fine--is much valued--and can\r\nwith great facility be used in manufactures. The quantity usually\r\ncontained on one skin is about eight pounds.\"\r\n\r\nSo far from the sheep being invariably a wool-bearing creature, it\r\nwould appear as liable to be entirely destitute of it as some other\r\nanimals; for in Tartary, the eastern parts of India, China, and some\r\nparts of Africa, a hair of varying quality forms their sole covering;\r\nand Sir Joseph Banks imported three from Spain, which were smooth,\r\nsleek, and as short-haired as a horse.\r\n\r\n(25.) _Structure of the Skin._--The skin is composed of three coats,\r\nor layers; the outermost, the cuticle or scarf-skin, is a thin\r\ndelicate membrane, devoid of feeling, and of a scaly texture, pierced\r\nby innumerable small holes, for the passage of the hairs, and\r\nperspiration, and covering the next, or mucous coat, so named from its\r\npulpy appearance. In this resides the colouring matter, which imparts\r\nits peculiar tints to the hair, and which can only be satisfactorily\r\ndemonstrated in the dark races. The existence of this coat has been by\r\nsome denied; but it is probable that, though present in all, it can\r\nonly be exhibited in such as have depth of tint, to admit of the\r\ndisplay. It is here that sensation principally resides; the nerves, or\r\nrather their terminations, ramifying minutely in its substance, at\r\nwhich they have arrived by piercing the third tunic, or true skin, a\r\ndense firm elastic membrane, in which the roots of the hairs are\r\nimbedded, and from which, in fact, they take their origin.\r\n\r\n(26.) _Sebaceous Follicles._--The skin is studded over by small\r\nglands, or what, in anatomical language, would be called sebaceous\r\nfollicles, which vary in number in different breeds, and different\r\nparts of the body, being most numerous on the breast and shoulders,\r\nand secreting a peculiar unctuous semi-solid matter, which, as we\r\nshall immediately see, possesses alkaline properties.\r\n\r\n(27.) _Connection of the hair with the skin_--_Yolk._--A hair\r\nimplanted in the skin may be compared to a plant growing in a\r\nflower-pot which has been sunk in the earth, as the root of the hair\r\ndoes not rise directly from the true skin, but from a little cup\r\nextending from it to the cuticle, and receiving nourishment from\r\nsurrounding vessels. After coming to the surface of these tunics it\r\nhas, in the sheep, yet another, and, in some respects, remarkable\r\ncovering to pierce, one which has occupied the attention of the most\r\ndistinguished chemists, and given rise to a good deal of disputation\r\non the subject of salving--we allude to the Yolk. It is supposed by\r\nmany to be the inspissated secretion of the sebaceous follicles, and\r\nreceives its name from its adhesiveness and colour. It is most\r\nplentiful on fine-woolled sheep, those of the south possessing more\r\nthan those of the north of our island, while merinos possess most of\r\nall; so that there is apparently some connection between a fine\r\nfleece, and a good supply of this matter. According to the analysis of\r\nM. Vauquelin, it consists principally of a soapy matter, with a basis\r\nof potash; a small quantity of carbonate of potash; a minute quantity\r\nof acetate of potash; lime in an unknown state of combination; and an\r\natom of muriate of potash. It owes its odour to a small quantity of\r\nanimal oil, and is in every respect a true soap, which would permit\r\nthe sheep to be completely washed in a stream, but for the existence\r\nin the fleece of an uncombined fatty matter, which remains attached to\r\nthe wool, and renders it rather glutinous.\r\n\r\nMany have tried to account for the uses of the Yolk, but nothing like\r\nsatisfactory conclusions have been come to: some considering it goes\r\nto form the filament, and is consolidated into a transparent mass\r\nwhile the pile is growing; while others argue, that it is a peculiar\r\nsecretion which exudes through the skin, and by mixing with the pile\r\nrenders it soft and pliable, affecting it in the way that oil does a\r\npiece of leather. In the latter opinion I coincide. For my part, I\r\nview it as a secretion, depending very much on good food and\r\nsteadiness of temperature, and, therefore, indicative of a fine fleece\r\nonly so far as the health of the animal is concerned. In the human\r\nbeing the state of the skin may often guide us, though blind-fold, to\r\nthe quality of the hair, so that the latter may be pronounced either\r\ndry and coarse, or glossy, soft, and silky, as the skin may prove\r\neither harsh and ungrateful, or pleasant, and, if I may be allowed the\r\nexpression, alkaline to the touch. Every thing having a tendency to\r\naffect the health may always be considered as calculated to diminish\r\nthis secretion, and, consequently, to deteriorate the quality of the\r\nwool.\r\n\r\nThe relative positions of the layers of the skin, the mode in which\r\nthe hairs rise from them, and the form and situation of the sebaceous\r\nfollicles, will be better understood by referring to the following\r\ncross section Fig 5. Pl. V., in which the line marked\r\n\r\n    _a_ Represents the cuticle,\r\n    _b_ The mucous layer,\r\n    _c_ The true skin,\r\n    _d_ Sebaceous follicles,\r\n    _e_ Hairs rising from the true skin and inflections of the\r\n          upper layers and piercing,\r\n    _f_ The thin film of the yolk.\r\n\r\n(28.) _Periodical decidence of Wool._--It is affirmed that the only\r\nreal difference between hair and wool is in the latter falling off\r\nperiodically; but the same change takes place in animals totally\r\ncovered with hair; in fact, almost every animal is subject to\r\nmoulting, or a periodical decidence of its protecting covering. The\r\nfleece of the sheep has been proved in many instances not to be liable\r\nto _annual_ changes of this description;--Lord Western having, among\r\nothers, shown that the wool of the merino may be retained at least\r\nthree years without the slightest disposition to separate.\r\n\r\nThe annual employment of shearing, to anticipate this falling off of\r\nthe wool, is now common in most parts of the world; yet some, as the\r\nIcelanders and Kamtschadales, still retain the primeval custom of\r\n_rowing_, or pulling off the fleece in a mass, about the end of May,\r\nat which time it is nearly loosened. This loosening of the attachments\r\nof the fibre is supposed to be owing to a diminution, during winter,\r\nof the nutritive process at the root of the hair, so that the fibre is\r\nliable to give way at the tender part when the fleece becomes heavy\r\nduring Spring. This attempt at an explanation meets, however, with the\r\ninsurmountable objection, that long-woolled are less liable than\r\nshort-woolled sheep to this occurrence, a circumstance which ought to\r\nbe the reverse, if weight had any thing to do in the case.\r\n\r\n(29.) _Falling off of Wool prevented by Clipping._--Clipping has a\r\ncurious influence over the duration of the covering of animals, as is\r\nwell exemplified by the correct popular idea, that the only way to\r\nprevent the hair of children dropping off (as it sometimes has a\r\ntendency to do) is to cut it short: we may suppose the benefit in this\r\ncase to result from the removal of a _portion_ of each hair, which, if\r\nallowed to remain, would lead to a sacrifice of the _whole_, by\r\nrobbing the root of a quantity of nutritious matter, which, owing to a\r\ndiminution of reproductive power, it could ill afford. In this way\r\nonly can we account for the power which shearing evinces, in putting a\r\nstop to the attempt sometimes made by nature to change the coverings\r\nof some sheep. In the valley which separates the most eastern chain of\r\nthe Cordilleras from the central, the wool grows upon the lambs in the\r\nsame manner as in temperate climates, provided they are sheared so\r\nsoon as it has arrived at a certain thickness; in which case the wool\r\ngrows again, preserving the same order. But, if the period for\r\ndenuding the animal be allowed to pass, the wool detaches itself in\r\nflakes, leaving behind a short, glossy, and compact hair, exactly\r\nresembling that of the common goat in the same climate.\r\n\r\n(30.) _Form of woolly fibre._--The fibre of wool is circular,\r\ndiffering in diameter in the various breeds, and different parts\r\nof the same fleece. The following _a propos_ observations are\r\nfrom the article on the Sheep, in the Library of Useful Knowledge:\r\n\"The filaments of white wool, when cleansed from grease, are\r\nsemitransparent; their surface in some places is beautifully polished,\r\nin others curiously encrusted, and they reflect the rays of light in a\r\nvery pleasing manner. When viewed by the aid of a powerful achromatic\r\nmicroscope, the central part of the fibre has a singularly glittering\r\nappearance. Very irregularly placed minuter filaments are sometimes\r\nseen branching from the main trunk, like boughs from the principal\r\nstem. This exterior polish varies much in different wools, and in\r\nwools from the same breed of sheep at different times. When the animal\r\nis in good condition, and the fleece healthy, the appearance of the\r\nfibre is really brilliant; but, when the sheep has been half starved,\r\nthe wool seems to have sympathized with the state of the constitution,\r\nand either a wan pale light, or sometimes scarcely any, is reflected.\"\r\n\r\nThe more transparent the filament the better is the fleece, and its\r\nvalue is impaired by the transparency being different in the same\r\nfleece, or, as often happens, in the same filament; while that which\r\npossesses fineness with a close ground, pureness, elasticity, colour,\r\ntenacity, and not much pitch-mark, is the most esteemed, and preferred\r\nby the manufacturer. Wethers have considerably more wool than ewes. In\r\nevery fleece there are several qualities, even so many as nine\r\ndifferent sorts, which are all separated from each other in England by\r\nmen called woolstaplers, who are appointed for the purpose, and sworn\r\nto do justice between the grower, and the merchant or manufacturer. In\r\nthis manner the latter obtains, without trouble or risk, the very kind\r\nwhich he knows will suit his purpose; for though the sorter,\r\nsurrounded by a number of baskets, divides the wool according to its\r\nproperties without the slightest hesitation, and with a rapidity truly\r\nsurprising, yet such is the amount of the dexterity acquired by\r\npractice, that a mistake seldom occurs, and his judgment can as rarely\r\nbe disputed.\r\n\r\n(31.) _Structure and properties of Hair and Wool._--Each hair is\r\ncomposed of a number of filaments, or smaller hairs, ranged side by\r\nside, and this we can perceive without the slightest trouble, from the\r\ntendency it sometimes has to unravel at the apex; and again, by\r\ndrawing a hair through the fingers from point to root, when we feel a\r\nroughness occasioned by projecting filaments, which only proceed a\r\ncertain distance up the trunk, the longest being most internal.\r\n\r\nPl. V. Fig. 5, _e_, exhibits those points in a hair considerably\r\nmagnified.\r\n\r\nThese projections, or serrations, which vary in number in different\r\nspecimens of wool, are what it depends on for its felting properties.\r\nThey are sharper and more numerous in felting wools than in others,\r\nand the better the felting properties of the wool, the more numerous\r\nthe curls; because what induces curling on the animal's back leads\r\nto felting in the hands of the manufacturer. In felting, these\r\nprojections catch one upon another, and occasion the hair to move in\r\none direction, which is invariably root foremost, as we perceive on\r\ngiving it a twirling motion between the finger and thumb; and it is\r\nonly by the union of curve and serration, that felting can be\r\naccomplished certainly and perfectly.\r\n\r\nWoolly fibre consists of a semitransparent stem, or stalk, supposed\r\nto be hollow, as represented at Fig. 4, Pl. V. and is partly\r\ndistinguished from hair by the latter being opaque. Next to soundness,\r\nthere are few qualities deserving of so much attention as softness,\r\nof which the ancient writers make frequent mention, and for the\r\nprevalence of which in our present wools fashion has done not a\r\nlittle. It is a quality that tends, in a material degree, to the cheap\r\nand easy working of the cloth, and, as such, is said to render wool 25\r\nper cent. more valuable to the manufacturer than a harsh and brittle\r\npile. It apparently depends on the fineness of the fibre, which should\r\nnot, however, go the length of weakness. Fineness is in turn mainly\r\nconnected with the yolk, the secretion of which ought, on that\r\naccount, to be promoted by attention to the general management of the\r\nanimal, as it is well known to undergo a change of properties by\r\nstarvation, exposure, or any neglect whatever.\r\n\r\n(32.) _Particular soils injurious to Wool._--Soil, also, has much\r\ninfluence on the pliability of wool. Chalky lands, which are so\r\nnotorious for injuring the fleece, are supposed to act in the manner\r\nof a corrosive, but the correct explanation is, not that the chalky\r\nparticles attack the fibre in a direct way, but that they render it\r\nbrittle, by absorbing the oily moisture with which it is naturally\r\nimbued. Moreover, the plants growing in such situations cannot but be\r\ninjurious to sheep, owing to their impregnation, though a slight one,\r\nwith calcareous matter; for grooms know well how soon a horse's coat\r\nbecomes disordered by the frequent use of hard or well water, and\r\nprefer, therefore, the river for their steeds.[4]\r\n\r\n        [4] I am surprized to find it asserted at page 76 of the book\r\n        on Sheep, published by the Society for the diffusion of Useful\r\n        Knowledge, that the depilatory action of lime-water on raw\r\n        hides is a \"_striking elucidation_\" of the injurious effects\r\n        of chalk on wool. Lime removes hair from a skin because it is\r\n        a powerful caustic, and, as such, speedily decomposes the\r\n        animal matter, but the carbonate of lime (chalk) is perfectly\r\n        innocuous to wool, except so far as it combines with its oil;\r\n        and is as little _corrosive_ to the fleece, as pipe-clay to a\r\n        soldier's coat.\r\n\r\n(33.) _Felting._--The felting of wool may be defined as a property\r\ndepending on the curls and serrations of the fibre, by which it is\r\nallowed to move only with the root foremost, and by which it is\r\nenabled to catch and retain a hold on fibres that are near it, so as\r\nto form a web or cloth. Felting is best brought into operation by\r\nalternate pressure and relaxation, which may be produced in a variety\r\nof ways: the ancient method, and one still pursued by the Tartars, was\r\nto tramp on a mass or layer of moist unwrought wool, so as to form a\r\ncoarse cloth or carpet; while the modern, and more perfect plan is,\r\neither, as in hat making, to apply pressure with the hands, or, as in\r\nthe finishing of cloth, to pass the fabric repeatedly through rollers.\r\nThe way in which a close fabric is formed, by the juxta-position of a\r\nfew scattered hairs, gave rise for long, as well it might, to serious\r\ndisputations among philosophers; and the favourite theories of each,\r\nunbased as they were on observation, might till now have agitated the\r\nscientific portion of our manufacturers, had not the microscope\r\nbrought to light much of what is true and valuable in our researches.\r\n\r\nMoisture appears to be of service during the felting of wool, as it\r\ninduces it to curl, enabling the fibres to expand, and catch one on\r\nanother, after they have been bent and compressed, by the force\r\napplied to them, and is of itself sufficient to felt a fabric, as we\r\nfrequently perceive in the instance of stockings, which have been\r\nallowed to remain too long in water, when they become short from\r\nundergoing contraction, and resemble after such treatment an imperfect\r\ncloth. It is for this reason that the hatter, after tumbling over, in\r\nall directions, the fur of which the hat is to be made, wets it before\r\napplying pressure; and, that the woollen manufacturer, after freeing\r\nthe web from grease, soaps it before its subjection to the action of\r\nthe rollers.\r\n\r\nWithout felting, cloth would resemble a net, and would unravel on\r\nbeing cut, from the fibres crossing only in two directions; but the\r\nstrokes of the mill put an end to this, by laying the fibres in every\r\npossible direction, and so twining them one with another, as to render\r\nthem a coherent mass.\r\n\r\n(34.) _Different kinds of Wool._--The wool of this country is divided\r\ninto two great classes--long and short: the former varies in length\r\nfrom three to eight inches, and before being made into stuffs and\r\nworsted goods, requires to be deprived of its felting tendencies, by\r\npassing it through heated iron combs, which remove the feathery parts,\r\nor serrations, and make it resemble silk or cotton.\r\n\r\nThe shorter combing wools are in general used for hose, and are softer\r\nthan the long combing wools. Short wool is employed in the cloth\r\nmanufacture, and is, on that account, frequently called clothing wool.\r\nIt should approach in colour as much as possible to white, as a clear\r\nwhite ground is required for all cloths that are to be dyed bright\r\ncolours, as well as for those dressed white: grey or black hairs\r\ninjure the fleece very much, even though few and minute, as they give\r\nrise to reddish spots where the cloth is stoved. Herefordshire sheep\r\nare entirely free from this defect, and are, therefore, reckoned\r\nparticularly valuable for clothing purposes.\r\n\r\n(35.) _Alterations induced by Crossing._--The breed exercises\r\nconsiderable influence on the wool, some sheep, as the merinos, being\r\ndistinguished for the softness and beauty of the fleece; while others,\r\nas some of our small northern varieties, are famed for the very\r\nopposite characteristics.\r\n\r\nAccording to the opinion on the continent, any race of ewes, however\r\ncoarse and long in the fleece, will, on the fourth cross of the merino\r\nram, give progeny with short wool equal to the Spanish. The truth of\r\nthis proposition is however doubted, in a communication to the Board\r\nof Agriculture, by Dr Parry of Bath; but it is certain, he adds, that\r\none cross more will in most cases effect the desired purpose. \"If we\r\nsuppose,\" he says, \"the result of the admixture of the blood of the\r\nmerino ram to be always in an exact arithmetical proportion, and state\r\nthe native blood in the ewe as 64, then the first cross would give\r\n32/64 of the merino, the second 48/64, the third 56/64, the fourth\r\n60/64, the fifth 62/64, and so on. In other words, the first cross\r\nwould leave 32 parts in 64, or half of the English quality; the second\r\n16 parts, or one-fourth; the third 8 parts, or one-eighth; the fourth\r\nfour parts, or one-sixteenth; the fifth 2 parts or one-thirty-second;\r\nthe sixth 1 part, or one-sixty-fourth; and so on. Now, if the filament\r\nof the Wiltshire, or any other coarse wool, be in diameter double that\r\nof the Ryeland, it is obvious that, according to the above statement,\r\nit would require exactly one cross more to bring the hybrid wool of\r\nthe former to the same fineness as that of the latter. This, I\r\nbelieve, very exactly corresponds with the fact. The difference\r\nbetween one-eighth and one-sixteenth is very considerable, and must\r\ncertainly be easily perceived, both by a good microscope, and in the\r\ncloth which is manufactured from such wool. In the latter method, it\r\ncertainly has been perceived; but I have had hitherto no opportunity\r\nof trying the difference by the former. The fifth cross, as I have\r\nbefore observed, brings the merino-Wilts wool to the same standard as\r\nthe merino-Ryeland.\"\r\n\r\n(36.) _Bratting injurious to Wool._--Wool rendered fine by clothing\r\nsheep, is never equal to that which owes its perfection to natural\r\ncauses. The Saxon wool, which is principally produced by _artificial_\r\nmeans, has been compared, from its inelastic sickly appearance, to\r\ngrass that has been secluded from the sun. The custom of _bratting_ is\r\ntherefore not to be recommended, and indeed is now nearly laid aside.\r\nHousing sheep with the same intentions is also bad, inasmuch as it\r\nmust affect their health, and destroy the curl of the fibre. Shelter\r\nis however absolutely necessary from extremes both of heat and cold,\r\nas temperature has much influence on the covering of animals, and in\r\nnone more than the sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nBRITISH WOOL TRADE.\r\n\r\n\r\n(37.) _Origin of the Wool Trade._--Wool, since Eden closed its gates\r\non our progenitors has been a current coin, an important material, on\r\nwhich has been employed the skill and industry of almost every tribe,\r\nand been the means of raising many a petty people to the hard-won\r\ndignity of a nation. Man, at first placed in a comfortable\r\ntemperature, needed little as a defence against the weather; while\r\nfashion, then unthought of, or only as a sport, failed to interest the\r\nsimple-minded races in the cut or texture of the coverings they wore.\r\nThat the first dresses of mankind were formed from vegetable\r\nmaterials, we have the highest authority for believing; and even at\r\npresent, the garb of the natives of some of our lately discovered\r\nislands, consists of a simple girdle formed from rough-cut reeds. But\r\nas the dawn of knowledge smiled upon the savage, and animal sacrifice\r\ntutored him in the uncouth rudiments of a coarse anatomy, the superior\r\ncomfort, even of the untanned hide would be remarked, and the clumsy\r\nmantle of the Caffre hordes welcomed as a change. Time would not long\r\nelapse till roving dispositions, and the encounter of unstable\r\nclimates, would show the wanderer the necessity of a fabric better\r\nadjusted by shape and pliancy, to the nature of his wants; while the\r\nclinging of lock to lock of woolly fibre would plainly tell the\r\nsuperfluous nature of the supporting skin, and point the way to make\r\nan ill-closed cloth.\r\n\r\n(38.) _Invention of Weaving._--Weaving is not absolutely necessary for\r\nthe manufacture of cloth, since wool will felt, though far from\r\nevenly, without the preliminary process of being laid in threads, so\r\nthat cloth may have been almost coeval with mankind without our being\r\nrequired to assign much mechanical ingenuity to its inventors. But we\r\nhave tolerably clear evidence in the inspired writings, that weaving\r\nwas known in the earliest ages, and that it was trusted principally to\r\nthe women:--Thus Delilah wove Samson's hair when he slept in her lap;\r\nand a short time after, it is written, that the mother of Samuel \"made\r\nhim a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year.\" At a\r\nlater period, Solomon thus describes a good wife:--\"She seeketh wool\r\nand flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.\"[5] That garments were\r\nin those early ages made of several pieces, joined by needle work, is\r\nevident on a perusal of Genesis, xxxvii. 3; Judges, v. 30; and 2\r\nSamuel, xiii. 13; and this plan is allowed to be even more ancient\r\nthan the weaving of flax. Job, who flourished, or is supposed to have\r\nflourished, before the Israelites left Egypt, shows clearly by his\r\nwords that flannel clothing was then in vogue: \"Let me be condemned if\r\nI have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without\r\ncovering; if his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed\r\nwith the fleece of my sheep;\" and that the cloth was woven, and not\r\nproduced by beating, is evident from his saying, when complaining of\r\nhis sad estate, \"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle.\"\r\n\r\n        [5] The art of weaving was first practised at Arach in\r\n        Babylonia, and spread thence to neighbouring cities, and\r\n        in process of time to the most remote parts of the\r\n        world.--_Bryant's Ancient Mythology_, Vol. v. p. 173.\r\n\r\n(39.) _The early progress of the Wool Trade_ is veiled in much\r\nobscurity, and only to be discovered by seeking for it in a mass of\r\nfable, which in many instances enabled the old writers to string\r\ntogether the dry details of history, in a manner suited to the taste\r\nand habit of their time. The following may be taken as a specimen.\r\nPhryxus, the son of Athamas king of Thebes, fleeing with his sister,\r\nHelle, from their stepmother, and riding upon (carrying with him) a\r\nram which had a golden (valuable) fleece, sought to cross the\r\nDardanelles, when Helle was drowned, and the sea was ever after called\r\nthe Hellespont: but Phryxus arrived safely at Colchis, between the\r\nBlack and Caspian seas, and having sacrificed the ram to Mars, hung\r\nthe fleece in a temple dedicated to that god. By this the ancients no\r\ndoubt meant to intimate, either that Boeotia, the birth-place of so\r\nmany talented Greeks, furnished the people of Colchis with sheep, or\r\nthat they sent them sums of money in exchange for the wool of\r\nCaucasus. That the latter is the more probable, is apparent from\r\nOvid's account of the Argonautic expedition, in which he shows the\r\nhardships which Jason encountered in his successful endeavours (B.C.\r\n1225) to bring the golden fleece from Colchis back to Greece--implying\r\nthe value of the article, and leading us to believe, that the\r\nColchians had, by the aid of severe penalties, long monopolized the\r\ngrowth of wool. Moreover, Mount Caucasus and its neighbourhood form\r\nthe favoured nursery whence the improved fleece-bearing animals have\r\ngradually spread over the world; and as such would be looked upon, at\r\nthe time I speak of, by adjacent tribes with jealousy and hatred; for\r\nwhere is the nation that can calmly behold a compeer engrossing a\r\nhoard of wealth, without struggling to lower their prices by a market\r\nof their own?\r\n\r\nThus one country after another became impressed with the advantages to\r\nbe derived from the husbandry of sheep. Nation after nation improved\r\nits agriculture, by the introduction of the animal, till at last the\r\nRomans became pre-eminent for their attention to its culture, and to\r\nthe manufactures of which it is the fruitful source. Generous even to\r\nan enemy, and attacking only to enrich the countries they subdued,\r\nEngland may bless the hour which saw the legions of the world's\r\nmistress planting the Imperial Eagle on her shores.\r\n\r\nInstead of following the progress of the wool trade among foreign\r\nnations in later times, the limits of the present work compel me to\r\nconfine myself to an outline of the British trade from its origin, at\r\nthe time of the invasion by the Romans, to the present period.\r\n\r\n(40.) _Introduction of Weaving into Britain._--It is evident from\r\nancient history, that the first inhabitants of all the countries of\r\nEurope were either naked, or nearly so, owing to their ignorance of\r\nthe clothing art. Such, in particular, was the uncomfortable condition\r\nof the inhabitants of this island, who are supposed to have used the\r\nbark of trees, and to have smeared themselves with unctuous matter,\r\nafter the manner of other savages, to protect themselves from cold.\r\nSome writers are of opinion, that the inner bark of trees alone was\r\nemployed, and that not till woven into a kind of cloth, such as the\r\nSouth Sea islanders at present make. They continued the abominable\r\npractice of anointing their bodies, long after the people of France,\r\nSpain, and Germany, were decently clothed, so differently were they\r\nsituated in regard to intercourse with strangers, and opportunities of\r\nacquiring the useful arts. It is impossible to discover with certainty\r\nwhen, or by whom, the custom of wearing clothes was introduced into\r\nBritain. Some suppose that the Greeks, and after them the Phoenicians,\r\nwho visited the Scilly islands, and sometimes the continent of\r\nBritain, for trading purposes, first awakened in the breasts of our\r\nsavage ancestors a desire for comfortable coverings, as both these\r\nnations were celebrated for elaborate attention to their attire.\r\n\r\n\"The Britons,\" says Caesar, \"in the interior parts of the country are\r\nclothed in skins.\" These are supposed not to have been sewed together,\r\nbut to have been cast over the shoulders as a mantle. Their stiffness,\r\nhowever, rendered them aught but pleasant, as we may guess from their\r\nendeavours to make them soft and pliable, by steeping in water,\r\nbeating them with stones and sticks, and rubbing them with fat. The\r\npeople of the southern parts are supposed to have been well acquainted\r\nwith the dressing, spinning, and weaving, both of flax and wool,\r\nhaving been instructed by a Belgic colony, long before the invasion by\r\nthe Romans. Two kinds of cloth, which they manufactured at this\r\nperiod, were much esteemed by their invaders; the one a thick harsh\r\ncloth, worn in cold climates as a sort of mantle, and agreeing in many\r\nrespects with our Lowland plaids; the other made of fine wool, dyed of\r\ndifferent colours, woven into chequered cloth, and corresponding to\r\nour Highland tartan. They are also believed to have made felts of\r\nwool, without either spinning or weaving, and to have stuffed\r\nmattresses with the portions shorn from it in dressing. The Britons\r\nmust have been well acquainted with the dyeing of wool, as the Gauls\r\nwere then celebrated, according to Pliny, for the invention of a\r\n\"method of dyeing purple, scarlet, and all other colours, only with\r\ncertain herbs.\" The plant, which they chiefly used for the purpose,\r\nwas the glastum or woad, and they seem to have been led to the\r\ndiscovery of its value in dyeing cloth, from their former use of it in\r\nstaining their bodies. A deep blue having been the colour they stained\r\ntheir skins, it long continued a favourite; particularly, with the\r\nCaledonians, as a tint for all their dresses. Though the most\r\ncivilized of the ancient Britons were tolerably versed in the most\r\nessential branches of the woollen manufacture, yet that useful art was\r\nnot diffused over our island till the landing of the Romans, whose\r\nsoldiers, being almost all drawn from the plough, were well adapted,\r\nwhen settled in the country, to foster the arts of peace. In order to\r\nbenefit themselves and the island, their emperors were at great pains\r\nto discover and procure the best artificers of every description,\r\nparticularly the best manufacturers of woollen and linen cloths, whom\r\nthey formed into colleges, or corporations, endowed with various\r\nprivileges, and governed by a procurator, who was under the direction\r\nof that great officer of their empire, the Count of the Sacred\r\nLargesses. In this manner it appears that the first woollen\r\nmanufactory was established at Venta Belgarum, now Winchester, a\r\nhundred years after the conquest of the country.\r\n\r\nIt has been believed, from Britain having been partly peopled from\r\nSpain, that our sheep were originally Spanish; and, as Giraldus\r\nCambrensis (Collectan. de Reb. Hibern.) affirms, that the Irish in his\r\ntime were clothed in black garments, from the wool of their sheep\r\nbeing so coloured, some have supposed the sheep of that island were\r\nimported from Spain, a supposition rendered probable by Southey\r\ntelling us, in his letters from that country, that in the north of the\r\nPeninsula the animals are almost all of a black colour.\r\n\r\nNo mention ever occurs in the ancient writers, of the importation of\r\nsheep into Britain, from which it may be supposed, that they had found\r\ntheir way into it long before its forcible separation from the\r\ncontinent by natural convulsions. Cambden, in his work on Britain,\r\nquotes from an old orator, part of a beautiful panegyric on the great\r\nConstantine, in which the happiness of Britain is eloquently\r\ndescribed, and its advantages in regard to sheep graphically depicted.\r\n\"Innumerable are thy herds of cattle, and thy flocks of sheep, which\r\nfeed thee plentifully, and clothe thee richly.\" So that, even allowing\r\nfor the high-flown nature of the verbiage, the sheep of the island\r\nmust have been far from indifferent, and well worthy of any trouble\r\nthe grasping Romans may have been put to, in the erection of\r\nmanufactories.\r\n\r\n(41.) _Importance of the British Woollen Manufacture._--The history of\r\nour wool, and the woollen manufacture, is, at one period and in one\r\npoint of view, the history of our public revenue, while in a\r\nsucceeding period it becomes the capital object of our commerce, and\r\nthe important subject of our political councils. The preserving and\r\nsupporting it against foreign rivals, the due regulation of its\r\nnumerous branches, and the proper restrictions deemed requisite to\r\nensure to this country the commercial benefits resulting from it, have\r\noccupied our ablest statesmen for many centuries.\r\n\r\nThe wools of England have always been in the highest repute, and that\r\nmore abroad than at home. Their fineness and abundance have been\r\nascribed by many to the sweet short grass on most of our downs and\r\npastures, and to the sheep having the privilege of feeding, all the\r\nyear round, without being shut in folds; but it cannot be denied,\r\nthat, though food and climate may have much concern in the matter, the\r\nenergetic industry and persevering attention with which an Englishman\r\ndevotes himself to the attainment of an object, have tended more than\r\nany other circumstance to the advancement of our wools, and woollen\r\nmanufactures, and to the consequent prosperity of our island.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the existence of so many laws relating to wool is, that\r\nit continued for ages to be the principal commodity, meeting all\r\ndemands for the support of armies, and payment of public revenues, and\r\naffording aids to the crown, which were in general granted therein.\r\nThe scarcity of money in England before the discovery of America,\r\nrendered it necessary to levy taxes frequently in kind, and as wool\r\nwas abundant, it often figured as the representative of a more\r\nportable currency. Part of the L300,000 demanded by the Emperor of\r\nGermany as the ransom of Richard I., was raised by a loan of wool.\r\nEdward I., the great reformer of our laws, imposed a duty of 6s. 8d.\r\non every sack of wool exported, and the like sum on every 300\r\nwool-fells; but soon after, when his necessities demanded a larger\r\nincome, he laid those additional duties on foreign merchants, which\r\nafterwards became the tonnage and poundage, so famous in England's\r\nhistory. Among these additions, the former taxes on wool and fells\r\nwere increased by forty pence, while at the same time, like other\r\nmonarchs of the period, he occasionally received subsidies of wool. In\r\nthe same way Edward III., in attempting, during the twelfth year of\r\nhis reign, to wrest the crown of France from the house of Valois,\r\nprocured a grant of half the wool in England, amounting to 20,000\r\npacks, which, taking it as valued by some authors at L40 a pack, must\r\nhave realized the sum of L800,000.\r\n\r\n(42.) _Weavers brought from Flanders._--Commerce and industry were at\r\na very low ebb during the time of Edward III., the principal export\r\nbeing wool, which only brought into the kingdom about L450,000. Edward\r\npromoted the woollen manufacture by bringing, in 1331, John Kemp, with\r\nseventy Walloon families, weavers, from Flanders, and, owing to the\r\nwant of native skill in this department, gave every encouragement to\r\nforeign weavers. (11 Edward III. cap. 5.)[6] A further encouragement\r\nwas given to the home manufacture, by the enactment of a law (11\r\nEdward III. cap. 2) which prohibited every one from wearing any cloth\r\nnot of English fabric. Parliament, however, in an evil hour, thwarted\r\nthese benefits, by prohibiting the exportation of woollen goods,\r\ncertainly an injurious step, so long as wool was allowed to be shipped\r\nfrom our ports.\r\n\r\n        [6] Macpherson, in his Annals of Commerce, agrees with\r\n        Bloomfield the historian of Norfolk, that a colony of Flemish\r\n        weavers settled so early as 1327, at Worsted, a village in\r\n        that county, and bestowed upon it the name it bears.\r\n\r\nOn the introduction of the Flemish weavers, Kendal became the\r\nmetropolis of this branch of industry, and was soon equalled in the\r\nextent of its manufactories by many other towns, as Norwich, Sudbury,\r\nColchester, and York; while woollens were spun and wove, though to a\r\nless extent, in Devonshire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire,\r\nHampshire, Berkshire Sussex, and Wales.\r\n\r\n(43.) _Regulations regarding Staples._--The _staple_, or market for\r\nwool, was fixed by act of Parliament (27 Edward III.) in particular\r\ntowns of England, but was afterwards removed by law to Calais, and\r\nEnglish merchants were prohibited from exporting any goods from the\r\nstaple, or, in other words, foreign navigation was abandoned. To the\r\ncustom of taking subsidies in kind, may be traced the principle of\r\nthose multifarious regulations which fixed the staple in certain\r\ntowns, either in England, or more commonly on the continent; and to\r\nthe fluctuating state of politics may be ascribed the shiftings which\r\nthose staples so frequently underwent; but it is not easy to see the\r\ndrift of many of the provisions relating to it, some of which tend to\r\nthe benefit of foreign, rather than of British, commerce.\r\n\r\n(44.) The progress which this manufacture made in a very short period,\r\nmay be well illustrated by the following table of exports and imports\r\nin woollen, about the middle of the fourteenth century, or twenty\r\nyears after the arrival of John Kemp and his establishment.\r\n\r\n  EXPORTS.\r\n\r\n  Thirty-one thousand, six hundred and\r\n  fifty-one and a half of wool, at L.6\r\n  value each sack,                          L189,909  0  0\r\n\r\n  Three thousand, thirty-six hundred\r\n  and sixty-five fells, at 40s. value,\r\n  each hundred at six score,                   6,073  1  8\r\n\r\n  Whereof the custom amounts to               81,624  1  1\r\n\r\n  Fourteen last, seventeen dicker, and\r\n  five hides of leather, after L.6 value\r\n  the last                                        89  5  0\r\n\r\n  Whereof the custom amounts to.                   6 17  6\r\n\r\n  8,061-1/2 of worsted, after 16s. 8d. value,\r\n  the price is                                 6,717 18  4\r\n\r\n  Whereof the custom amounts to                  215 13  7\r\n                                           ---------------\r\n  Summary of the out-carried commodities\r\n  in value and custom,                      L285,635 17  2\r\n                                           ---------------\r\n\r\n\r\n  IMPORTS.\r\n\r\n  1,832 cloths, after L.6 value each,         10,922  0  0\r\n\r\n  Whereof the custom amounts to                   91 12  0\r\n                                           ---------------\r\n\r\n  Summary of the in-brought woollens\r\n  in value and custom,                       L11,013 12  0\r\n\r\nThat the imported cloths were much finer than those exported, may be\r\ninferred from their comparative value as here stated, and we may\r\nconclude pretty justly, that the fabrication of coarse cloths\r\nexclusively occupied the manufacturers of Britain, while the finer\r\nfabrics were still brought from abroad, and that, in fact, the wants\r\nof the _mass_ of the people were the regulators of British industry.\r\n\r\n(45.) _Subsidies raised by Edward III._--In 1338, Edward took a\r\nfifteenth of all the commonalty of his realm in wool, rating the price\r\nof every stone of 14 lbs. at 2s., although, in the previous November,\r\nhe had sent the Bishop of Lincoln, and the Earls of Suffolk and\r\nNorthampton, with one thousand sacks of wool, into Brabant, which,\r\nbeing sold at L.40 a sack, procured him L.40,000. Edward was\r\napparently not very sure how far his subjects would submit to so\r\nsweeping a taxation, as we find him addressing a letter, dated\r\nBerwick-upon-Tweed, March 28th, 1338, to the Archbishops of York and\r\nCanterbury, desiring the favour of their prayers, and requesting that\r\nthey would excuse him to his people, on account of the great taxes he\r\nwas obliged to lay upon them. During the summer of 1339, the laity\r\ngranted to the king the one-half of their wools throughout the whole\r\nrealm, a favour his majesty is reported to have received most\r\ngraciously; but of the clergy he levied the whole, compelling them to\r\npay nine merks for every sack of the best wool. Knighton, who held an\r\noffice in the Abbey of Leicester, says that that house alone furnished\r\neighteen sacks. The revenue officers during this reign appear to have\r\nexercised their calling with great strictness, and to have interfered\r\nin an especial manner with the secret trade of the inhabitants of\r\nBristol, but this was terminated by the king granting a licence, dated\r\nLangley, November 25th, 1339, to their weavers, allowing them \"to make\r\nwoollen cloth without being liable to any molestation from the king's\r\nofficers.\"\r\n\r\n(46.) _Progress of the trade under Henry VII., Henry VIII., and Edward\r\nVI._--During the bloody and destructive wars of the white and red\r\nroses, when success graced the arms alternately of York and Lancaster,\r\ncommercial enterprise was almost at a stand. This unhappy period\r\nbrought, however, with all its evils, blessings in its train, and\r\nHenry VII. not only did more for the advancement of the wool-trade\r\nthan his predecessors, but also gave it greater vigour than it could\r\nlay claim to at any former period. Fine cloths were much improved in\r\nhis reign, and luxury began to be attended to in an article, which,\r\ntill then, had only been rendered amenable to comfort. The\r\nostentatious reign of Henry VIII., gave an additional impulse to the\r\ntrade, and cloth was sold in 1512 for five merks, which fifty years\r\nbefore would only have brought about forty shillings; while, in\r\nconsequence of increasing wealth, population, and consumption, the\r\ndemand was materially increased. A new market was also opened up for\r\nthe exit of their woollens, by the establishment of an intercourse in\r\n1516 with several islands in the Archipelago, and a few of the towns\r\non the coast of Syria.\r\n\r\nEdward VI., or rather his ministers, for he was then a minor,\r\nattempted to lay a poll-tax upon sheep, every ewe kept in a separate\r\npasture being charged threepence, every wedder twopence, and all sheep\r\nkept on commons three-halfpence; but it was found to be so oppressive,\r\nso annoying to the people, and so difficult to collect, that it was\r\nrepealed during the next year. England made a distinguished figure in\r\nthis reign as a commercial nation. The manufacture of woollens was\r\nraised to a great height. Cloth, besides being exported to Flanders,\r\nfound its way to Holland, Hamburgh, Sweden, and Russia, whose coarse\r\nwarm stuffs were very much wanted, and the trade wore such an air of\r\naffluence, that a tax of eightpence in the pound was laid upon all\r\ncloth made for sale in England. This, however, was speedily repealed,\r\na very short time serving to point out, that, though made for an\r\nendurance of three prosperous years, the people who were galled by a\r\ntrifling impost on their sheep, would not, unless under very\r\nfavourable circumstances, submit to imposts on the fabrics which they\r\nwore.\r\n\r\nDuring the reigns of Henry VII., Henry VIII., and Edward VI., an undue\r\npreference was given to grazing. Acts were framed to put a stop to\r\nthis mismanagement, which was fast ruining the country, by driving\r\npeople from it. Henry VII. exempted Norwich from the penalties of the\r\nlaw, on account of the decay of manufactures from the want of hands;\r\nand shortly after the whole county of Norfolk obtained a like\r\nexemption in regard to some branches of the woollen trade. The\r\npractice of depopulating the country, by abandoning tillage, and\r\nthrowing the lands into pasturage, had run to so great an extent in\r\nthe time of Henry VIII., that an enactment was made, whereby the king\r\nbecame entitled to half the rents of the land where any farm-houses\r\nwere allowed to fall to decay. The number of sheep in a flock was at\r\nthe same time limited to two thousand. Hume conjectures, in his\r\n_History of England_, that unskilful husbandry was probably the cause\r\nwhy the proprietors found no profit in tillage;--thus leading a farmer\r\nto keep a flock sometimes of twenty-four thousand as expressed in the\r\nstatute. This had the effect of increasing the price of mutton, a\r\nremarkable coincidence, which parliament attributes to the commodity\r\nhaving gotten into few hands, though Hume ascribes it to the daily\r\nincrease of money, thinking it almost impossible that such an article\r\ncould be engrossed. At the commencement of the reign of Edward VI.,\r\nthe people were still sadly deficient in a knowledge of agriculture--a\r\nprofession, which, as Hume wisely remarks, of all employments,\r\nrequires the most reflection and experience. A great demand having\r\narisen for wool both at home and abroad, whole estates were laid\r\nwaste, while the tenants, regarded as a useless burden, were expelled\r\ntheir habitations, and the cottagers deprived even of the commons on\r\nwhich they fed their cows; no wonder there was a decay of the people!\r\n\r\n(47.) _Wool Trade encouraged by Elizabeth._--Elizabeth extended her\r\nprotection to the Protestants who fled from the persecutions of the\r\nDuke of Alva in the Low Countries, and the woollen manufactories\r\nbecame more flourishing than ever--so much so, that, although in 1552,\r\na large quantity of raw material was exported, yet in less than thirty\r\nyears, the people of Germany, Poland, France, Flanders, Denmark, and\r\nSweden, were covered with British cloths; two hundred thousand pieces\r\nbeing annually exported, though the price was nearly tripled. At that\r\ntime the processes by which woollens are rendered beautiful were\r\nunknown in England, and as our exports consisted in white undressed\r\ncloth, the profits upon dyeing and finishing, amounting to nearly a\r\nmillion a year, were lost. This was attempted to be remedied by\r\nprohibiting the exportation of white cloths, but the Dutch and\r\nGermans, who benefitted by the dyeing processes, forbade the entrance\r\nof any English woollens dyed in the piece, into their territories, and\r\nthe export consequently fell immediately from 200,000 to sixty pieces.\r\nThen the restriction was taken off. It was at this crisis that the\r\nfabrication of medley cloths, or mixtures of wool dyed of different\r\ncolours and wrought into the same web, was commenced.\r\n\r\n(48.) _Woollen Cloth monopolized by the merchant adventurers._--Though\r\nnine-tenths of the commerce of the kingdom consisted in the time of\r\nJames I. of woollen goods, wool was allowed to be exported till the\r\nnineteenth year of his reign, when it was forbidden by proclamation,\r\nbut never strictly enforced. The cloth was very little admired even at\r\nhome, and though it was the staple commodity of the realm, a company\r\nof merchant adventurers were allowed by a patent, to possess the sole\r\ndisposal of it. Elizabeth at one time attempted to rescue this\r\nimportant trade from the hands of these merchants, but they instantly\r\nconspired, and ceased to make purchases of cloth, when the queen was\r\nnecessitated to restore the patent. A board of trade was brought\r\ntogether by James I. in 1622, and one of the purposes contemplated was\r\nto remedy the low price of wool, which was leading the people to\r\ncomplain of the decay of the woollen manufacture; but Hume supposes,\r\nand with every appearance of probability, that this fall of prices\r\nproceeded from an increase of wool.\r\n\r\n(49.) _English consumption of Wool increased._--Till the fifteenth\r\ncentury our wool was sold in the fleece to such as came to buy it.\r\nAmong the principal of our customers were numbered the Flemings, and\r\nBrabanters, and in particular the merchants of Ghent, and Louvain, who\r\ntook off vast quantities for the supply of two manufactories, that had\r\nflourished in those cities from the tenth century, and had furnished\r\nthe greater part of Europe, and even England itself, with every kind\r\nof woollen cloth. Thus they might have continued, to the great loss\r\nof our island, had not the democratic hands employed in those\r\nmanufactories repeatedly revolted, owing to their determination to\r\nresist a tax on looms, and being at length punished and dispersed,\r\nfound their way in no long time to Holland. While in the last place,\r\nthe spirit of sedition still being dominant, certain of their party\r\nattacked and killed some of the civil authorities, for which they had\r\nto make a precipitate flight to England, where they settled as\r\npeaceful citizens, and instructed our people in the working of wool.\r\nThis occurred in 1420, from which time neither skill, money, nor\r\nenactments, have been spared to enable us to retain so valuable a\r\ntrade. In the reign of Edward IV., every pack of English wool was\r\nliable when exported to a custom of 50s., a goodly sum in those days,\r\nand one which brought a yearly revenue of L 250,000. This excessive\r\ncustom, almost amounting to a prohibition, added to the above\r\nmentioned opportunities, in a manner compelled the people to\r\nmanufacture for themselves, and in this they succeeded so well, that\r\nby the time of Elizabeth, the exportation of live sheep and wool was\r\nprohibited on pain of having the right hand struck off. It does not\r\nappear that this enactment was ever repealed, though supposed to be so\r\nby the 12th of Charles II. cap. 32, see. 3, which, without taking away\r\nthe penalties imposed by former statutes, imposes a new penalty;--20s.\r\nfor every sheep exported, or attempted to be exported, together with\r\nthe forfeiture of the sheep.\r\n\r\n(50.) _Severity of prohibitory enactments reprobated._--By the 14th of\r\nCharles II. chap. 18 the exportation of wool was deemed felony, and\r\npunished accordingly. This tended in no slight degree to the defeat of\r\nthe ends intended, by hindering all who were not cold-blooded from\r\nbringing to justice the actors in so trifling an offence. This was\r\nsoon however seen through, and corrected, by the 7th and 8th of\r\nWilliam III. chap. 28, sec. 4, in which it was declared, that \"Whereas\r\nthe statute of the 13th and 14th of King Charles II., made against the\r\nexportation of wool, among other things in the said act mentioned,\r\ndoth enact the same to be deemed felony, by the severity of which\r\npenalty the prosecution of offenders hath not been so effectually put\r\ninto execution; be it therefore enacted, by the authority aforesaid,\r\nthat so much of the said act, which relates to the making the said\r\noffence felony, be repealed and made void.\"\r\n\r\nAdam Smith, when commenting in his \"Wealth of Nations,\" on the laws\r\nrelating to wool, reprobates severely the ill-judged compliance of our\r\ngovernment, in yielding to the solicitation of our merchants, and\r\nallowing them to sway with iron rule the commerce of the world. \"The\r\nseverity of many of the laws which have been enacted for the security\r\nof the revenue, is very justly complained of, as imposing heavy\r\npenalties upon actions, which, antecedent to the statutes that\r\ndeclared them to be crimes, had always been understood to be innocent.\r\nBut the cruelest of our revenue laws, I will venture to affirm, are\r\nmild and gentle in comparison to some of those which the clamour of\r\nour merchants and manufacturers has extorted from the legislature, for\r\nthe support of their own absurd and oppressive monopolies. Like the\r\nlaws of Draco, these laws may be said to be all written in blood.\"\r\nNone of the laws, however, were effectual, not even the one passed in\r\nthe middle of the seventeenth century, by which the offence was\r\nrendered capital. In spite of the vigilance of our government, a\r\ncontraband trade in wool was long carried on between the inhabitants\r\nof the French and English coasts, especially those of Sussex, by a\r\nclass of men called _Owlers_, from their only venturing abroad in\r\nthe night, and who were tempted to despise the penalty, with an\r\nintrepidity astonishing to the rest of Europe, by the high prices that\r\nwere sure to be afforded to them in the Gallic market. Again, during\r\nthe first half of the eighteenth century, large quantities of wool\r\nwere constantly smuggled from Ireland to France, by which our trading\r\ninterests were considerably injured, and the plans for suppressing\r\nexportation shown to be worse than useless.\r\n\r\n(51.) _Prosperity of the Dutch Manufacturers._--The woollen\r\nmanufactures of the Hollanders were first established in 1636, or\r\n1637, by one hundred and forty English families, who went from Norfolk\r\nand Suffolk, to settle at Leyden, and Alkmaer. The Dutch manufacture\r\nof fine woollen cloths was, however, commenced much earlier, or about\r\n1624, at which time they began to interfere with the English trade in\r\nthe Netherlands; insomuch that, in the twenty-second year of the reign\r\nof James I., a certificate was given to the Parliament of 25,000\r\ncloths having been made that year in Holland. Upon this the House of\r\nCommons resolved, 1st, \"That the merchant adventurers setting impost\r\nupon our cloth, is a grievance, and ought not to be continued; and\r\nthat all other merchants promiscuously, as well as that company, may\r\ntransport everywhere northern and western kersies, and new draperies.\"\r\n\r\n2dly. \"That other merchants, besides the Merchant Adventurers'\r\nCompany, may freely trade with dyed and dressed cloths, and all sorts\r\nof coloured cloths, into Germany and the Low Countries.\" Much\r\nannoyance appears to have resulted to this island, from the progress\r\nwhich the manufacturers in Holland still continued to make, and some\r\ncurious speculations were of course formed in the minds of the\r\ningenious. In 1651, a scheme was laid before the English commonwealth,\r\nfor obtaining from the court of Spain an exclusive right to purchase\r\n_all_ the Spanish wool; or, in other words, to ruin the Holland\r\nmarket, by stopping the supplies. The projector observed, \"That this\r\nproposed preemption would totally dissolve the woollen manufacture of\r\nHolland, which, by means of that wool (Spanish), hath of late years\r\nmightily increased, to the destruction of the vent of all fine cloths,\r\nof English manufacture, in Holland, France, and the east country; and\r\nhath drawn from us considerable numbers of weavers, dyers, and cloth\r\nworkers, now settled at Leyden, and other towns in Holland, by whose\r\nhelp they have very much improved their skill in cloth, and have made\r\nin that one province (one year with another) 24,000 or 26,000 cloths\r\nyearly. That the Hollanders have of late years bought and exported\r\nfrom Biscay, four-fifth parts at least of all their wools, and have\r\nsold there proportionally of their own country stuffs.\" This was\r\ncertainly a novel method of accomplishing an end by a sweeping\r\nmonopoly; but the theory was too fine-spun ever to be reducible to\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n(52.) _Fluctuating State of the Trade between 1635 and 1693._--By the\r\ngreat act of tonnage and poundage, passed in 1660, on the restoration\r\nof Charles II., taxes were imposed, among other things, on the\r\nexportation of woollen manufactures, and it was not till the reign of\r\nWilliam, that the wretched policy of such regulations was discovered,\r\nand a law was passed in 1700, by which the duties on woollens were\r\nabolished, because in the words of the act (ll & 12 William III. chap.\r\n20), \"the wealth and prosperity of the kingdom doth, in a great\r\nmeasure, depend on the improvement of its woollen manufactures, and\r\nthe profitable trade carried on by the exportation thereof.\"\r\n\r\nIn the time of Charles II., an act was passed for the erection of\r\nmanufactories (Par. I, Sess. I, Cap. 40), by which it is enacted, that\r\nno native or stranger is to export wool nor skins with wool upon them,\r\nuntil made into work, or put to the best advantage, under the pain of\r\nfirst value thereof, half to the king, and half to the informer. It is\r\nalso, in this act, ordered, \"that none forestall the mercat of wooll,\r\nnor keep up the same to a dearth, under the pain against regrators and\r\nforestallers, and that for eschewing the deceit of putting stones, or\r\nthe like stuffs therein, no wooll be wrapt up in the fleece, under the\r\npain of confiscation, half to the king, and half to the discoverer and\r\npursuer, declaring always that the Exchequer may licence the export of\r\nwool and skins, as they shall see cause.\"\r\n\r\nThe French refugees, in 1635, brought money and talent into England,\r\nand contributed greatly to the erection of manufactories for _slight_\r\nstuffs, and other French fabrics, never before made in England. The\r\nformer law for burying in woollen not being well observed, it was\r\nrepealed by an Act of Parliament, in the thirtieth year of that king\r\n(cap. 3.), which enacted a register to be kept in every parish, by the\r\nincumbent or his substitute, that every thing about the corpse of the\r\ndeceased was made of sheep's wool, of which an affidavit was to be\r\nmade by the relation of the deceased, and lodged with the incumbent,\r\nunder the penalty of L5, a moiety of which went to the poor of the\r\nparish; the rest to the informer. But this was a sorry check, as\r\nvanity was so predominant among the rich, that they paid the penalty\r\nrather than want the pleasure of adorning their departed relatives\r\nwith lace and linen.\r\n\r\nIn 1667, France supplanted England in many foreign markets, owing to\r\nthe care that Colbert at that time took to bring the French woollens\r\nto perfection. The English immediately turned their attention to other\r\nmanufactures, in which, as in that of paper, they quickly excelled,\r\nand thus compelled the French to abandon markets, in which they had\r\nlong remained without a rival.\r\n\r\nIn 1698, a problem was started concerning the manufactures of the\r\ncountry--whether or not a general linen manufacture would prove\r\nbeneficial to England? As London at this time abounded with new\r\nprojects and schemes, all promising as usual a hoard of wealth, the\r\nquestion caused much excitement. It was at last determined that a\r\nnovelty of this kind would lead to the sowing of a great quantity of\r\nflax in England, and the neglect of the woollen manufacture, which\r\nwould follow, might probably lower the price of land; for, as they\r\nsaid at the time, \"it requires about twenty acres of land to breed\r\nwool, for setting on work the same number of hands which one acre of\r\nflax would employ; and yet, in the end, the woollen manufacture will\r\nbe found to employ by far the greatest number of hands, and yield the\r\nmost profit to the public, as well as to the manufacturers.\"\r\n\r\n(53.) _Irish Manufactures discouraged._--In the same year (1698), the\r\nEnglish house of Peers addressed King William with the view of\r\ninducing him to discourage the woollen manufactures of Ireland, which,\r\nin spite of many restrictions, still continued to cause much vexation\r\nto the monopolizers of England. The address ran thus:--\"The growing\r\nmanufacture of cloth in Ireland, both by the cheapness of all sorts of\r\nthe necessaries of life,[7] and _the goodness of materials for making\r\nall manner of cloth_, doth invite his subjects of England, with their\r\nfamilies and servants, to leave their habitation to settle there, to\r\nthe increase of the woollen manufacture in Ireland, which makes his\r\nloyal subjects in this kingdom very apprehensive, that the further\r\ngrowth of it may greatly prejudice the said manufacture here; and\r\npraying, that his Majesty would be pleased, in the most public and\r\neffectual way that may be, to declare to all his subjects of Ireland,\r\nthat the growth and increase of the woollen manufacture there, hath\r\nlong, and will ever be, looked upon with great jealousy by all his\r\nsubjects of this kingdom.\" A similar address was presented by the\r\nCommons, and this most liberal and enlightened monarch was pleased to\r\nanswer, \"_Gentlemen, I will do all that in me lies to discourage the\r\nwoollen manufacture of Ireland._\" This was certainly altogether a\r\nstrange proceeding, especially when viewed in conjunction with the\r\ncruel prohibitions of former periods.[8] Their foreign trade is said\r\nby some to have been much diminished by this coolness; but much of the\r\npoignancy and crushing animosity of the request are lost when we\r\nconsider that encouragement was at the same time given by England to\r\nthe making of Irish linen, his Majesty being desired in the same\r\naddress, to forward that manufacture, pursuant to the dictates of an\r\nact passed in 1696. Nay, some are of opinion that these measures\r\nresulted from the soundest views of the relative situations of the\r\ncountries, and that the prudent tenor of English enactments was never\r\nbetter exhibited, than in the discouragement of the woollen and\r\nencouragement of the linen manufactures of Ireland.\r\n\r\n        [7] The people of Ireland produced worsted and woollen yarn at\r\n        a cheaper rate than we could, owing to their poor being able\r\n        to work on lower terms than those of England. This was owing\r\n        to the rent of land being less in Ireland than in England.\r\n\r\n        [8] By the 18th of Charles II. the importation from Ireland\r\n        into England of great cattle, sheep, swine, beef, pork and\r\n        bacon, and shortly after of mutton, lamb, butter, and cheese,\r\n        was declared a common nuisance, and forbidden on pain of\r\n        forfeiture. Thus, the principal resource of a poor country in\r\n        the neighbourhood of a rich one, was unfeelingly denied to it,\r\n        till the reign of George III., when the hated edict was\r\n        repealed.\r\n\r\n(54.) _British Trade in 1699._--In 1699 there were 12,000,000 sheep\r\nand lambs in Britain, and the yearly increase was supposed to be about\r\n3,600,000. The value of each sheep, besides the skin, was 7s. 4d. The\r\nstock was valued at L4,400,000. The value of the wool yearly shorn,\r\nat 3s. 4d. per fleece, came to about L2,000,000. The woollens\r\nmanufactured in Britain amounted in value to L5,000,000 per annum,\r\nwhile our yearly exports of the same were valued at L2,000,000. Many\r\nwere at that time afraid of the sinking of the woollen manufacture,\r\nbecause the accounts of the fine draperies exported were larger than\r\nusual; but, says an anonymous essayist of the period, \"such do not\r\ncontemplate, that, though the old may be lessened, what is commonly\r\ncalled the new draperies have increased, consisting in bays, serges,\r\nand stuffs. So that upon the whole, infinitely more of the material of\r\nwool has of late years been wrought up for foreign use, than in former\r\ntimes; and herein our merchants have been only forced to follow the\r\nmodes and humours of those people with whom they deal, and the course\r\nthey have pursued has hitherto not been detrimental to the public.\"\r\n* * * \"'Twere better, indeed, that the call from abroad were only for\r\nthe fine draperies, because then we should be in a manner without a\r\nrival; no country, but England, and Ireland, having a sward or turf\r\nthat will rear sheep, producing the wool of which most of our\r\ndraperies are made. 'Tis true the wool of Spain is fine above all\r\nothers; but 'tis the wear only of the richer sort, and of Spanish\r\ncloths not above nine thousand pieces are sent abroad, one year with\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\n(55.) _British Woollens rivalled by those of Sweden._--Before the\r\npeace of Utrecht in 1713, we had no rival in the woollen trade but the\r\nDutch, over whom we had many natural advantages, such as situation,\r\ngoodness of our ports, and excellence of the principal constituents of\r\nthe manufacture. They were obliged to furnish themselves with the\r\nmaterials at second-hand. When the trade in woollens was properly set\r\na-foot in England, during the long and happy reign of Elizabeth, the\r\ninterest of money was pretty much the same in both countries; but the\r\nDutch were engaged in a hazardous and bloody war, and in establishing\r\ntheir Commonwealth, and East India trade; and, therefore, had not much\r\ntime to think of improving any manufacture. Owing to these\r\ncircumstances, we came into possession of all the principal marts for\r\nwoollens, both in Asia and Europe, and retained them till the\r\nbeginning of the war with France and Spain; we then prohibited trade\r\nwith both these countries.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1720, our exportations to Sweden, of cloth, stuffs,\r\nand other woollen manufactures, amounted to L50,000. The Swedes,\r\nhowever, though situated in a severe climate, tried experiments with\r\nEnglish sheep, and with so great success, that, in 1765, they could\r\nboast of wool little inferior to that of England. They then erected\r\nmanufactories, and we were compelled to relinquish a market, which we\r\nhad long held to our profit and advantage.\r\n\r\n(56.) _Regulations from 1740 to 1742._--In the 12th year of King\r\nGeorge II. it was enacted by a statute (cap. 21), \"That whereas the\r\ntaking off the duties upon woollen or bay yarn imported from Ireland,\r\nmay be a means to prevent the exportation of wool, and of woollen\r\nmanufactures, from Ireland to foreign parts, and may also be of use to\r\nthe manufacturers of Great Britain, that from the first of May, 1740,\r\nthe same shall be no longer payable; excepting only the duties upon\r\nworsted yarn of two or more threads twisted or thrown, or on crewel\r\nimported from Ireland.\" At this time more than 1,500,000 persons were\r\nemployed on woollen articles, and were supposed to earn, one with\r\nanother, sixpence a-day for 313 working days, amounting in all to\r\nL11,737,500 yearly.\r\n\r\nIn 1742, the English poor suffered much from the contempt with which\r\nhome manufactures were regarded by the nobility, in consequence of\r\nwhich the latter were speedily the losers. The importation of woollen\r\nbroad-cloth, of the manufacture of France, into ports of the Levant,\r\non behalf of British subjects, being not only prejudicial by\r\ndiscouraging the woollen manufactures of Britain, but likewise a means\r\nof affording relief to an enemy, and discoveries having been made of\r\nBritish subjects fraudulently shipping from Leghorn quantities of\r\nFrench woollen goods for Turkey, under the denomination of British, to\r\nthe great detriment of English woollens; an act was passed in the 23d\r\nyear of King George II. by which provision was made against these and\r\nother fraudulent practices.\r\n\r\n(57.) _Improvements in the manufacturing of Woollens._--At the\r\ncommencement of the reign of George III. the woollen manufactures\r\nadvanced with a rapidity almost unparalleled in modern times as\r\nregards other branches of trade. Till about the year 1770 most of the\r\nprocesses were conducted by hand. The wool was spun by various persons\r\nat scattered residences, the manufacturers receiving the yarn\r\nperiodically from the numerous spinners. This arrangement caused much\r\nloss of time, and gave rise to frequent squabbles between the masters\r\nand their workmen. In fact, all the operations were tardy in the\r\nextreme. But at this period, the spirit of public and private inquiry\r\nwas happily directed to our deficiencies in the machinery of\r\nmanufactures. Inventions of great beauty and ingenuity were slowly\r\nbrought forward to facilitate our commercial acquirements. Human\r\nlabour has thus been lightened and abridged,--a greater number of\r\nhands have been profitably employed, and an excellent lesson afforded\r\nto the lovers of use and wont, which will not speedily be forgotten.\r\n\r\nBy these improved means the cloth is possessed of greater evenness,\r\nless injury is sustained in the dressing and shearing, and greater\r\nbeauty is imparted to its appearance. A great advantage is also\r\nobtained by the master knowing the exact duration of each process, so\r\nthat he can time his goods for any hour, or market, and is enabled to\r\ncirculate his capital with a degree of certainty, and despatch,\r\nformerly looked upon as quite impossible. A few years ago the late Sir\r\nJohn Throckmorton sat down to dinner, dressed in a coat, the wool of\r\nwhich, on the same morning, was on the sheep's back. The animals were\r\nsheared, the wool washed, carded, spun, and woven; the cloth was\r\nscoured, fulled, sheared, dyed and dressed, and then made into a coat.\r\nAll these complex operations were gone through without hurry, and\r\nwithout deducting from the work any part of the time usually devoted\r\nto similar fabrics. So great was the advantage derived from this\r\napplication of machinery, that in the year 1800 the produce was three\r\ntimes larger than in the year 1739, though the number of persons\r\nemployed was the same in the one year as in the other.\r\n\r\n(58.) _Duty imposed on imported Wool._--For three centuries a free\r\nimportation of foreign wool was permitted by our government, and it\r\nwas not till 1803 that any one thought of laying a duty upon it. This\r\nduty was at first comparatively light, amounting only to a halfpenny\r\na-pound, and it continued under a penny a-pound, till 1819, when Mr\r\nVansittart raised it to six-pence. The impolicy of this measure is\r\nevident, when we consider, that we were losing our ascendancy in this\r\nmanufacture, that our export of woollen goods had been declining for\r\nthree years previous to 1819, and that the competition was becoming\r\nevery moment more severe. This tax was much dreaded by our merchants,\r\nwho, clearly perceiving the state of matters, warned Mr Vansittart, by\r\nrepresenting to him, in the strongest terms, the fatal influence it\r\nwould have upon our trade. Its effects are best exhibited by its\r\ndisastrous influence on the foreign trade in woollens, which fell off\r\nabout a fourth in value, almost immediately after the imposition. The\r\nfollowing table places this in the clearest point of view:--\r\n\r\n  _Declared value of woollens exported._\r\n\r\n  1816,                                  L9,387,455\r\n  1817,                                   7,847,280\r\n  1818,                                   7,177,335\r\n  1819,                                   8,145,327\r\n  1820,           (_duty increased_)      5,989,622\r\n  1821,                (_ditto_)          5,587,758\r\n  1822,                (_ditto_)          6,465,988\r\n  1823,                (_ditto_)          6,490,454\r\n  1824,                (_ditto_)          5,635,776\r\n  1825,                (_ditto_)          6,045,240\r\n\r\nThe opinions of our merchants ought to have formed the best of all\r\nbeacons in pointing the course to be pursued by Mr Vansittart; but,\r\neven if they had been silent on the subject, the evidence of Mr\r\nBainbridge, before the Committee of the House of Commons, appointed in\r\n1820, to inquire into the state of the foreign trade of the country,\r\nmight have informed him of the true position of the wool trade, and\r\ndirected him in so hazardous an undertaking. When Mr B. was asked\r\nwhether he thought that an increase in the means of paying for our\r\nmanufactures would produce an increased consumption of them in Russia,\r\nSweden, and Prussia, he replied:--\"I believe the woollen manufactures\r\nin Prussia are in such a state as to be able to compete with us\r\ncompletely; I speak of it particularly, because we are in the habit of\r\nhaving transactions with the United States of America; and I find that\r\na very considerable proportion of fine woollens, and stuffs, are\r\nabsolutely shipped from the Netherlands, and from ports contiguous,\r\npart of which I understand to come from the interior of Germany, and\r\nfrom Saxony in particular; so that a portion of the trade, which we\r\nhave been in the habit of transacting with the United States, is\r\nfinding its way from the north of Europe. I, therefore, conceive, that\r\ntheir manufactures are competing with the manufactures of this\r\ncountry, and, consequently, they would not come to us to receive a\r\nsupply of those articles which they can purchase from their own\r\nmanufacturers at home.\" In 1825, at the earnest and obviously\r\nwell-founded representations of the manufacturers, Mr Huskisson\r\nreverted to the old system: and it was then wisely enacted, that all\r\nforeign wool imported for home consumption, of the value of 1s.\r\na-pound and upwards, should pay a duty of 1d. a-pound, but when the\r\nvalue of foreign wool was under 1s., the duty was reduced to a\r\nhalfpenny per pound. A boon was at the same time conferred upon the\r\nagriculturists, by the introduction of a new system with respect to\r\nthe exportation of British wool, the growers of which were allowed,\r\nfor the first time, to send it to foreign markets, on payment of a\r\npenny per pound.\r\n\r\n(59.) _Removal of the Restrictions on Foreign Wool._--The importation\r\nof wool was, by these reductions, speedily increased, and with it the\r\nconsumption of our woollens by foreign nations. The wool of our own\r\ngradually augmented flocks being inadequate to the demand, and that of\r\nSpain having been absorbed by our manufactories, large quantities were\r\nimported from Prussia, Saxony, and many parts of the continent of\r\nEurope, from which, antecedent to this run, little had been drawn. The\r\naverage annual import of wool during 1765-66-67 was 4,241,364\r\npounds--the average annual export of woollens during the same period\r\nwas L4,630,384; while the average annual import of wool for the years\r\n1822-23-24 was 18,884,876 pounds, and the average annual export of\r\nwoollens during the same time, amounted to L6,200,548, showing that\r\nthe importation of foreign wool was absolutely necessary for the\r\nwell-being of our manufactures. The importation of forty-four millions\r\nof pounds weight, in the year ending 5th January, 1826, must be\r\nascribed as much to the spirit of over-trading, which then affected\r\nevery branch of industry, as to the reduction of the duty; but the\r\nlarge importations during 1827, afforded an additional proof of the\r\nnecessity of foreign wool to the successful formation of a most\r\nimportant article of commerce. Mr Gott of Leeds, in his evidence\r\nbefore the Lords' Committee, on being asked if he could carry on to\r\nthe same extent as at present, if he manufactured his cloth of British\r\nwool, replied, that, in certain descriptions of cloth, \"_he could not\r\nmake an article that would be merchantable at all for the foreign\r\nmarket, or even for the home market, except of foreign wool_.\" He\r\nthen proceeds to state, that though the competition is very strong\r\nin every department of the manufacture, yet that foreigners are\r\ndecidedly superior to us in some description of low cloths. The\r\nfollowing question was then put, and plainly and emphatically\r\nanswered:--\"Speaking of the finer cloths, is the competition such as\r\nto render an additional duty on the importation of foreign wool likely\r\nto injure the export trade? _I have no doubt, speaking on my oath,\r\nthat it would be fatal to the foreign cloth trade of the country. I\r\nwould further say, that it would be equally injurious to coarse\r\nmanufactures of all kinds made of English wool._ The competition now\r\nwith foreigners is as nearly balanced as possible, and the disturbing\r\noperation of attacks of that description would necessarily enable the\r\nforeigner to buy his wool cheaper than we should do it in this\r\ncountry; the result would be, that foreigners would, by such a\r\npremium, be enabled to extend their manufactures to the exclusion of\r\nBritish manufactures of all descriptions.\" In another part of his\r\nevidence Mr Gott says, \"If two pieces of cloth at 10s. a-yard were put\r\nbefore a customer, one made of British wool, the other of foreign\r\nwool; one would be sold, and the other would remain on hand; I could\r\nnot execute an order with it. If any person sent to me for cloth at\r\n7s. or 8s. a-yard, and if it were made of English wool it would be\r\nsent back to me, and I must resort to foreign wool, or foreign mixed\r\nwith British, to execute that order.\" In fine, the British wool could\r\nnot be got rid of without a copious importation of foreign wool to aid\r\nthe manufacturer in his disposal of it, as fine cloths are so much\r\nbetter and more durable in their wear than coarse cloths, that they\r\nare coming more and more into demand, to the almost total exclusion of\r\nthe latter. Moreover, the good old custom of making home-spun cloth is\r\nreviving among our farmers, and as it is excellently suited for\r\nwork-day wear, though necessarily of an inferior gloss, coarse cloths\r\nwill, to a considerable extent, cease to be the concern of our\r\nmanufacturers. The only cloth, indeed, which the bulk of the people\r\nwill require, will be a finer material to form the garb for Sunday and\r\nholiday recreation.\r\n\r\n(60.) _Countries from which we derive our Wool._--Our markets are\r\nsupplied with foreign wool principally from the following\r\nplaces:--Australia, Van Dieman's Land, Cape of Good Hope, Peru,\r\nGermany, Spain, and Russia. The Tasmanian fleeces are preferred to the\r\nAustralian, and fetch, in general, higher prices, owing to their being\r\nfit for combing, while the latter, though making considerable advances\r\nin fineness, are still of short staple. Both are favourites with our\r\nmanufacturers, from their being firm in the pile, a quality resulting\r\nfrom the constant good health of the animal in those countries. The\r\nGerman wool takes precedence of the Spanish, and has done so since\r\n1819 or 1820. The King of Spain, about the year 1800, presented the\r\nElector of Saxony with a small merino flock, and, from that period,\r\nour importations from Spain have diminished, as those from Germany\r\nhave increased. From the period of its first introduction into\r\nGermany, till 1814, when peace once more fell to the lot of Europe,\r\nthese sheep were gradually spread over the kingdom of Saxony, and\r\nwhen, by the events of 1815, the continental trade was thrown\r\ncompletely open, the Saxon dealers, perceiving the value of this new\r\ncommercial article, commenced a regular trade in it with England. By\r\nthis new supply, the Spanish wool, as here shown, was slowly beaten\r\nfrom its hold on the British manufacturers.\r\n\r\n  _Importations into England of Wool from Spain and Germany, at three\r\n  separate periods._\r\n\r\n                   1800.           1814.              1827.\r\n\r\n  Germany,      421,850 lbs.    3,595,146 lbs.    22,007,198 lbs.\r\n\r\n  Spain and\r\n  Portugal,    7,794,758 lbs.    9,234,991 lbs.    4,349,643 lbs.\r\n\r\nAt these periods the ports of these countries were open to British\r\nmerchandize, so that we have here a convincing proof, that the wool\r\ngrowers of Spain do not owe their losses, as supposed by some, to the\r\nhostile incursions of the French, but to the friendly competition of a\r\nneighbouring state.\r\n\r\nWool, both of coarse and fine quality, is daily becoming a more and\r\nmore important export from the Black Sea, owing to the great range of\r\npasturage in Southern Russia. The ordinary wools are very coarse, and\r\nthe fleeces dirty and full of grass seeds. Though not subject to\r\nexport duty, it is not supposed that it will ever turn out a lucrative\r\narticle for the British manufacturer.\r\n\r\n(61.) _Wool Trade from 1800 to 1830._--The latest tabular accounts on\r\nwhich much reliance can be placed, are to be found in _M'Culloch's\r\nCommercial Dictionary_, but of these I am compelled to offer only an\r\nabridgment, and in general nothing but the sum total of his detailed\r\nstatements. The number of short-woolled sheep in England in 1800 was\r\n14,854,299; the number of long-woolled sheep in England in the same\r\nyear was 4,153,308. The quantity of British wool in 1800 amounted to\r\n325,269 packs; while in 1808 it had increased to 414,502 packs. The\r\nsheep and lambs' wool imported into Great Britain from foreign parts\r\nin 1810 was 10,914,137 lbs.; in 1815, 13,640,375 lbs.; in 1820,\r\n9,789,020 lbs.; in 1825, 43,795,281 lbs.; in 1830, 32,313,059 lbs. The\r\nincrease here observable in 1825 is accounted for above in our notice\r\nof the state of the taxes before and at that period. The exports of\r\nBritish sheep and lambs' wool in 1830 amounted to 2,951,100 lbs.;\r\nthose of woollen and worsted yarn to 1,108,023 lbs. By far the\r\nlarger proportion of these exports was intended for France and the\r\nNetherlands. The number of persons employed in the manufacture is\r\nestimated at from 480,000 to 500,000, and their wages at L9,600,000.\r\nThe value of the raw material is calculated at L6,000,000; the total\r\nvalue of the manufactured articles at L18,000,000 (as wool is supposed\r\nin general to be trebled in value by passing through the hands of the\r\nmanufacturer); and the interest on capital, sum to replace wear and\r\ntear, and manufacturers' profits at L2,400,000.\r\n\r\n(62.) _Wool Trade in 1832 and 1835._--\"The total number of pounds\r\nof sheep and lambs' wool imported into the United Kingdom, in 1832,\r\nwas--foreign, 28,128,973; produce of the Isle of Man, 13,516; quantity\r\nretained for home consumption, charged 1d. per lb. duty, 23,619,901;\r\nditto 1/2d., 1,571,328; ditto 6d. (red wool), 1,130; duty free\r\n(produce of British possessions), 2,473,991; total retained for home\r\nconsumption, 27,666,350; total quantity re-exported, 555,014. Quantity\r\nof foreign wool warehoused under bond, 5th January, 1833, 3,165,651.\r\nThe total quantity of British wool and woollen yarn exported from the\r\nUnited Kingdom in 1832 was, of the former, 4,199,825 lb.; of the\r\nlatter, 2,204,464 lb. The exportation of British woollen manufactures\r\nin 1832 was as follows:--Cloths of all sorts, 396,661 pieces; napped\r\ncountings, doffels, &c., 23,453 pieces; kerseymeres, 40,984 pieces;\r\nbaizes, 34,874 pieces; stuffs, woollen or worsted, 1,800,714 pieces;\r\nflannel, 2,304,750 yards; blankets and blanketing, 1,681,840 yards;\r\ncarpets and carpeting, 690,042 yards; woollens mixed with cotton,\r\n1,334,072 yards; stockings, woollen or worsted, 152,810 dozen pairs.\r\nSundries, viz., hosiery, rugs, coverlids, tapes, and smallwares,\r\nL55,443 1s. 8d. value. Declared value of British woollen manufactures\r\nexported, L5,244,478 10s. 10d.\"[9]\r\n\r\n        [9] Quarterly Journal of Agriculture, No. 24.\r\n\r\n\"The total quantity of wool imported into the United Kingdom, in the\r\nyear 1835, was by weight 42,208,949 pounds, which is rather more than\r\n4,000,000 pounds under the importation of 1834; but on the 5th\r\nJanuary, 1835, 6,494,266 pounds remained warehoused under bond;\r\nwhereas, on the 5th January, 1836, there were no more than 2,846,014\r\npounds so locked up. This is an important difference of stock on hand,\r\nwhich, no doubt, has tended, and will tend, to keep up the price of\r\nthe article. The country from which we import the greatest quantity of\r\nwool is Germany. In 1835, the amount was nearly 24,000,000 pounds\r\nweight. From Russia, to which our exports of manufactured woollens is\r\ncomparatively small, we imported upwards of 4,000,000 pounds; from New\r\nSouth Wales and Van Dieman's Land, taken together, about 209,000\r\npounds weight more than from Russia. The next largest importations are\r\nfrom Spain, Turkey, and Italy, which, taken together, supply us with\r\nnearly 4,000,000 pounds. Portugal furnishes 683,000 pounds; Holland,\r\n201,000 pounds; and Belgium, 231,000 pounds. Of the foreign wool which\r\nwe have imported, we re-exported in its unmanufactured state 4,101,700\r\npounds during 1835. And of the total quantity imported in 1835, we\r\nretained for manufacture 41,718,514 pounds. This is nearly 1,000,000\r\npounds more than was taken up by the manufacturers in the preceding\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\"The whole amount of British wool _exported_ in 1835, was 4,642,604\r\npounds, and of this 3,000,000 pounds were sent to Belgium, and\r\n1,500,000 pounds to France.\r\n\r\n\"In 1835, the 'declared value' (which, be it observed, is a real\r\nthing, and very different from the 'official value,' which is of no\r\nuse except as an indication of quantity)--the total declared value was\r\nL6,840,511; and of this amount upwards of L2,600,000 worth of woollen\r\ngoods went to the United States alone. Next after the United States in\r\nthe scale of our customers for woollens comes the East Indies and\r\nChina. To these we send the value of upwards of L800,000; to our North\r\nAmerican colonies the value of L418,000; and to the West Indies,\r\nL114,200 worth.\r\n\r\n\"In Europe, our best customer is Germany, which, in 1835, took\r\nL631,000 worth. Besides the more fully manufactured goods, Germany\r\ntook from us, in the same year, 1,191,000 pounds weight of woollen\r\nyarn. Of European customers, next after Germany come Portugal, which\r\ntook, in 1835, to the amount of L368,000; Holland, L245,629; Italy,\r\nL243,582; and Belgium, L123,727. Russia took only L93,025 worth of\r\nwoollen goods. The South American States begin to be good customers;\r\nBrazil took, in 1835, L337,788 worth, and Mexico and other States,\r\nL356,700 worth.\r\n\r\n\"Looking at the aggregate, the export of 1835 was fully a million\r\nsterling in value above that of 1834; but as the price was higher in\r\n1835, this is no certain guide to the proportion of increase in\r\n_quantity_. In the year 1835, we exported to France only L68,000 worth\r\nof woollen manufactures.\r\n\r\n\"We have already stated the _exports_ of woollen goods to the South\r\nAmerican States in 1835; the _import_ of unmanufactured wool from\r\nthese States in the same year was L2,176,000 pounds; from France it\r\nwas 104,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n\"We have only to add, as fiscal information connected with the\r\nforegoing analysis, that of the wool imported in 1835, 26,877,780\r\npounds paid to the revenue a duty of a penny per pound; 10,198,526\r\npounds paid one halfpenny per pound; and 6,397 pounds of 'red wool'\r\npaid sixpence per pound.\r\n\r\n\"The wool imported from British possessions does not pay duty. Of that\r\nthere were, in 1835, 4,635,811 pounds imported.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENT OF THE BREEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n(63.) This subject requires for its due consideration some slight\r\nattainments in anatomy and physiology, but as such attainments, slight\r\nthough they may be, are as rarely met with as required among the bulk\r\nof mankind, so the want of them may be the less regretted, seeing it\r\nis possible to render even the intricacies of the study plain and\r\nsimple, by an appeal to facts of every-day occurrence; which, having\r\nattracted the notice of the most unthinking, will serve as hooks on\r\nwhich I shall try to hang the better part of an interesting inquiry.\r\n\r\n(64.) _Early Improvers of Sheep._--There cannot be a more certain sign\r\nof the rapid advances of a people in civilization and prosperity, than\r\nincreasing attention to the improvement of live-stock. It tells of a\r\npopulation limited in regard to soil, and making every effort to\r\nremedy the want, by an economical doubling of the return for the usual\r\noutlay: for, while a tribe wanders at large, remaining at a particular\r\nplace only so long as provender holds out, and, striking the tent,\r\ndeparts for some far-off field, so long will their flocks be suffered\r\nto roam neglected, and flourish or decay, as chance directs.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Jacob, the possibility of determining the nature of\r\nthe offspring, by impressions on the parents, has been apparent to\r\nall; and the best means of perpetuating a good quality, or removing a\r\nbad one, have continued from time to time, to occupy the attention of\r\npatriotic individuals. As much appears to have been known about sheep\r\ntwo thousand years ago as at present, so true is it, that nothing new\r\nis to be met with; yet, that does not rob our modern improvers of\r\ntheir merits, for though they deserve little as inventors, they are to\r\nbe admired for that strength of mind, and determined perseverance,\r\nwhich enabled them to rouse their fellows from their lethargy, and\r\ncompel them to become in turn, benefactors of their country, and\r\nthemselves. The signs of a good ram are concisely laid down by Varro,\r\nby Virgil in his third Georgic, and by Columella; and, though the\r\nSpanish nobility were looked upon with wonder, (till eclipsed by our\r\nown extravagance,) in giving two hundred ducats, or fifty pounds for a\r\nram; yet Strabo assures us, that in his day (under Tiberius), they\r\ngave more than three times that sum for one of the breed of the\r\nCoraxi, a Pontic nation, believed to have the finest fleece in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe greatest recorded improvers of the sheep in ancient times were\r\nLucius Columella, and his uncle Marcus Columella, Spaniards of\r\ndistinction, who removed to Rome in the reign of Tiberius, and made\r\nagriculture the study and business of their lives. The former\r\ncommenced his celebrated treatise on husbandry during the reigns of\r\nTiberius, and Caligula, and appears to have finished it A.D. 55. It is\r\na work which may be read with advantage even at present, as it abounds\r\nwith much that is valuable, and is accessible to all through its\r\nEnglish translation.[10]\r\n\r\n        [10] I allude to this, as the author of the work on Sheep,\r\n        published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful\r\n        Knowledge, at page 123 of that book, laments the want of an\r\n        English translation of Columella. An excellent quarto\r\n        translation of his twelve books on Husbandry, and one on\r\n        Trees, was published at London, in 1745.\r\n\r\n(65.) _Modern Breeders._--It is only within a very recent period, that\r\nthe mode of improving live-stock by skilful breeding, has been properly\r\nattended to. The perfection of breeding formerly, was to have cows in\r\ncalf once a-year, and rear calves on as little milk as possible; and,\r\neven yet, there are only a scattered few who devote to it the attention\r\nit requires. The first, in modern times, who arrived at any thing like\r\neminence in this department, was Joseph Allom, of Clifton, who raised\r\nhimself by dint of industry, from a ploughboy, and for a long time\r\ncontrived to keep his methods secret, being supposed by many to have\r\nbought his ewes in Lincolnshire, at the very time he was constantly\r\nbringing them from the Melton quarter of Leicestershire. Though\r\npossessing talent, he does not appear to have had education enough to\r\navail himself of it, and accordingly never gained the extensive\r\npopularity which fell to the lot of his successors.\r\n\r\nAs the introducers of new and important plans of management in\r\nagriculture, are always rewarded by large profits, and the gratitude of\r\ntheir countrymen, so none were ever more generously dealt with in\r\neither respect, than Mr Robert Bakewell, of Dishley, and Mr Ellman, of\r\nGlynde. The former, who may be said to have created a _variety_,\r\nconsidered that a tendency to acquire fat was the first quality to be\r\nlooked to in an animal destined for the food of man; and on this, with\r\nhim a fundamental principle, was based the whole of his proceedings.\r\nDifferent opinions will of course be held on the merits of the theory\r\non which he acted but all must acknowledge, that we are indebted to his\r\nskill and experience, for the exertions which have been subsequently\r\nmade to improve the qualities of live-stock, in every district of the\r\nkingdom. It was by his example, in fact, that the farmers all over the\r\ncountry were stimulated to exertion, and be the system bad or good, it\r\nought to have our veneration, seeing that it was the commencement of a\r\nnew and most important agricultural era.\r\n\r\nJohn Ellman derives his well-earned fame, from the zealous manner in\r\nwhich he improved the Southdown sheep, and spread them through the\r\nempire. Till he directed his attention to the subject, every thing\r\nconnected with the management of the flock was left to chance, or at\r\nleast to the guidance of farm-servants, with whom, of course, it could\r\nnot be a matter of interest to select, or _sort_, suitable animals for\r\nthe continuance of the race. He speedily, however, corrected this\r\nmismanagement, and aided by the introduction of turnip-feeding, in no\r\nlong time, and without any admixture of foreign blood, materially\r\nimproved the breed.\r\n\r\nAbout seventy years ago, improvements also commenced in Scotland. Till\r\nthen, in many parishes, no farmer could keep sheep through the winter,\r\nand no place was reckoned so fatal to these animals as the undrained,\r\nand unsheltered parish of Eskdale-Muir, in Dumfriesshire. At last one\r\nWilliam Bryden rented the farm of Aberlosk, and soon, by the _original_\r\nplan of draining, and building stone enclosures, made it, to use the\r\nwords of his able biographer, Mr Scot of Selkirkshire, \"like the land\r\nof Goshen, good for cattle which it is to this day.\"\r\n\r\n(66.) _Varieties among Animals._--All organized matter is subject to\r\nvariety. It may be doubted whether, since the creation of the world,\r\nthere have ever occurred, either at the same, or at separate periods,\r\ntwo individuals in every respect perfectly alike. A plant, or an\r\nanimal, may resemble the rest of its species in chemical constitution,\r\nand in the number and situation of its organs, but is sure to differ\r\nfrom all in size, general configuration, and disposition of its parts:\r\nThese shades of difference, endless though they are, may be referred\r\nto two leading causes--climate and descent; the former embracing\r\ndeviations induced by temperature and resources of subsistence; the\r\nlatter including changes occasioned by management, modes of breeding,\r\nand influence of sex.\r\n\r\n(67.) _Varieties induced by Temperature._--The influence of temperature\r\nextends chiefly to the _colour_ and _development_ of animals. In cold\r\nregions the skin of the human race is fair, and the person squat and\r\nstunted, but as we approach the equator, the hue becomes deeper and\r\ndeeper, till it is jetty black, while at the same time, the stature\r\nattains nearer and nearer to the tallest proportions to which mankind\r\nseem naturally entitled. The animals of the arctic regions are, for the\r\ngreater part of the year, covered with a clothing of the purest white,\r\nwhich is, however, in many of them, abandoned for one of deeper tints\r\nas the solar heat begins to gain the ascendant. But how very different\r\ndo we not find the colours of intertropical animals. There vivid tints,\r\nand an almost metallic lustre, pervade animated beings, from the coral\r\nin its submarine abode, to the gallinaceous birds, the coxcombs of the\r\nforest. In this, as in every other department of nature, the most\r\nbeautiful harmony, or, in other words, a union of what is pleasing to\r\nthe eye, and suited for the comfort of the creature, every where\r\nprevails. The colour of an animal envelope is never at variance with\r\nthe tints of surrounding objects. A painter, for example, would not\r\nplace a flower or animal of brilliant hue amidst the monotonous aspect\r\nof an arctic landscape; neither would he picture the faintly-tinted\r\nbeings of a polar latitude, as surrounded by the warm and flashy\r\ncolouring characteristic of an oriental climate. As temperature, then,\r\ndetermines in a marked degree the colour and dimensions of every\r\nanimal, such variations render the division of living beings into races\r\nand varieties, a matter of necessity. Thus all human beings belong only\r\nto one species, which may, however, be divided into five races, and\r\nthese again into an infinity of varieties. The differences between a\r\nrace and a variety are, that the latter is a subdivision of the former,\r\nand that in the former the modifications are more profound, the changes\r\nnot being confined to the surface, but extending to the frame-work of\r\nthe body; whereas, to constitute a variety, nothing more is necessary\r\nthan the superficial influence of heat and light on the skin, and its\r\nappendages the hairs. The Negro and the Abyssinian are precisely\r\nsimilar in colour, yet they are by no means of the same race, as their\r\ndifferent features will distinctly prove; the Abyssinian approaching as\r\nmuch in cast of countenance to the European, as the negro does to the\r\nhigher orders of the ape. The same may be noticed among sheep, but this\r\nis sufficient for the present.\r\n\r\nThe changes induced by climate, result from the working of a power\r\ninherent in most animals and vegetables, by which they are suited\r\nwithin certain limits, for bearing up against removal from their\r\nordinary localities, and assuming a different cast, as the place of\r\ntheir exile may differ in degree from that which they have left. This\r\ngradual adaptation to circumstances by an accommodating power is\r\ntermed, in philosophical language, acclimation.\r\n\r\n(68.) _Adaptation of the Sheep to Climate._--No animal varies more\r\nthan the sheep, and none so speedily adapts itself to climate; it\r\nwould almost appear that nature, convinced of its great utility, had\r\nbestowed upon it a constitution so pliant, as to enable it to\r\naccommodate itself to any point in a wide scale of temperature; for\r\nthough its natural situation as a wool-bearing animal, like that of\r\nman appears to be the wine countries, yet with him, it has spread to\r\nevery quarter of the globe, becoming impressed at every change with\r\nsome peculiarity, alterable only by a change of situation, and\r\nvarying, we might almost affirm, with the weather; for, where the\r\ntemperature is equable, there does the animal preserve unchanged an\r\natmospheric stamp, and defies our efforts to alter the breed; while\r\nunder a fluctuating sky we can model it at will, though in this case,\r\ncontinued exertions are required to secure them for any length of time\r\nin an undeviating course.\r\n\r\n(69.) _Changes produced by Climate._--The wonderful power of\r\ntemperature in effecting changes upon animals, is well illustrated by\r\nthe Portuguese, who, after a residence of three hundred years in\r\nIndia, are said to be at present almost as black as Caffres. Bishop\r\nHeber, speaking of India, says, \"It is remarkable to observe how\r\nsurely all these classes of men (whites--Persians, Greeks, Tartars,\r\nTurks, and Arabians), in a few generations, even without any\r\ninter-marriage with the Hindoos, assume the deep olive tint, little\r\nless dark than a negro, which seems natural to the climate.\" Buchanan\r\nalso in his travels through the same country, alludes to a tribe of\r\nblack Jews who have, in all probability, been settled in the district\r\never since the period of the captivity under Nebuchadnezzar, 3000\r\nyears ago, and who retain all the national peculiarities of their\r\nrace, with the exception of their colour, which is now as dark as that\r\nof the surrounding tribes. These examples, however, it may be\r\naffirmed, are not to the point, as embracing theories in regard to\r\npeculiar changes in an animal different from the sheep, but such\r\nobjections are perfectly groundless, as what will affect colour in\r\nmankind, will lead to changes even of a more wonderful nature in the\r\nsheep, seeing that it is abandoned more entirely to such an influence.\r\n\r\n(70.) _Temperature preferred by Sheep._--Sheep, though capable of\r\nthriving in a great variety of climates, seem to prefer such as are\r\ntemperate, and in these only do they arrive at perfection. They are\r\ncommon on the Cordilleras at an elevation of from 3300 to 8200 feet,\r\nwithin which limits they propagate readily without any care; but the\r\nreverse is the case in hotter regions, it being difficult to rear\r\nlambs in the plains of Meta, and no sheep are to be met with from the\r\nriver to the foot of the Cordilleras, though their skins, from being\r\nin demand for making parchment, sell as high as those of the ox. Sheep\r\nwere at one time, according to Thunberg, the scarcest articles in\r\nBatavia, as their woolly coat rendered the heat of the climate quite\r\ninsupportable; but this inconvenience was at last remedied by sending\r\nthem, on their arrival from the Cape, further up the country, to the\r\nBlue Mountains, where the air is several degrees colder. The question\r\nthen naturally occurs, if an elevation of temperature is, as in this\r\ninstance, fatal to these animals, how do they happen to have spread\r\nover a vast tract of country in spite of such extremes? Simply for the\r\nreason, that when an animal is left to the exercise of its own free\r\nwill, and the dominion of its instincts, it will not subject itself to\r\nthe danger of an extreme in any thing. It will not traverse several\r\nhundred miles in a single season, and thus expose itself to sudden\r\nchanges. The natural dispersion of all animals is gradual, so that\r\ntheir constitutions are enabled, from the slowness of the transition,\r\nto accommodate themselves, by an alteration in covering and habit, to\r\nsurrounding circumstances, which would, were the variations abrupt,\r\nspeedily destroy it. The reason why a race of animals occasionally\r\nthrives so well in a country to which it may be removed, appears to\r\nlie in its being suited, I may say, accidentally, by peculiar\r\nconformation, to the temperature to which it is transplanted. There\r\nare some happy climates where, introduce what animals you will, no\r\nmatter how stunted they are, or how different the degree of warmth may\r\nbe, their offspring will thrive, proving large and vigorous, and every\r\nway worthy of being placed at the head of its species. These are,\r\nhowever, cases where the transition is from an extreme of heat or cold\r\nto a temperate atmosphere. Witness what Mr Dawson, the manager of the\r\nAustralian Agricultural Company, says in his private journal (quoted\r\nin _Cunningham's New South Wales_). \"Both the climate and the soil\r\nappear by nature intended to produce fine wool, and fine animals too,\r\n_even from the worst beginnings_. The latter seems a paradox. The\r\nextensive range afforded to every animal keeps it in good condition,\r\nand, perhaps, the natural grasses may have more of good in them than\r\ntheir appearance indicates. However this may be, the climate clearly\r\nhas a wonderful effect on the size of all animals, even upon man, who\r\nis universally tall here, though born of diminutive parents. From this\r\nI am led to believe, that the climate governs chiefly, and thus every\r\nbreeding animal introduced here will attain a size not known in\r\nEurope.\"\r\n\r\n(71.) _Extent of the Alterations produced by Climate._--Changes\r\noccasioned by climate are always limited to the fleece, horns, and\r\ndisposal of the fat, and never extend to those parts, on the\r\npermanence of which the animal depends for its station in the scale of\r\nbeing, as the feet, teeth, and digestive organs. In tropical countries\r\nwe find the fleece approaching more to hair than wool, as in the sheep\r\nof Thibet, so celebrated for the silky nature of their coat. Burchell\r\nremarks, that the skins he brought from the Cape of Good Hope were\r\noften taken for those of an unknown quadruped, from the _furry_ nature\r\nof their wool, if such it can be called, and thinks it is owing as\r\nmuch to the pasture, which is well adapted for giving these animals a\r\nsoft and useful _fur_, though not suited, like New South Wales, for\r\nthe growth of the finest wool, and that the colony might turn this to\r\ngreat advantage. In cold regions the hairy covering is more developed\r\nand fully coarser, but always mingled with a proportion of hard rough\r\nwool. The influence of climate on portions of the fleece and skin is\r\nwell illustrated by circumstances which have occurred in Galloway,\r\neven within the limits of our traditionary writings.[11] The native\r\nsheep of the Highlands of that district is supposed to have been a\r\nsmall, handsome, _white-faced_ breed; at least so thinks John\r\nMacLellan, who wrote an account of Galloway in 1650, from the wool\r\nbeing much praised, and eagerly bought up by merchants, which would\r\nnot have been the case if taken from the _black-faced_ animal; yet how\r\nhappens it that at present the native breed exists only in the lower\r\nparts of Kirkcudbrightshire, the high country exhibiting _black-faced_\r\nsheep, which, after every trial, have been found best adapted to the\r\nclimate, and pasture of the moors and Highlands; while Chalmers owns\r\nthat it has not been ascertained when or whence this hardy breed were\r\nbrought to their present locality? Why, it is tolerably plain, that\r\nthough the _white-faced_ sheep might be placed there originally, yet\r\nthey would speedily lose every trace of their origin, and become\r\n_black-faced_ when placed on a hilly country, and subjected to the\r\nslow but certain influence of peculiar food and climate.\r\n\r\n        [11] Chalmers' Caledonia--Article, Galloway.\r\n\r\nMr Culley imagines, that the dun-faced sheep were the earliest tenants\r\nof the Scottish hills, but so far as my researches extend, that\r\nsupposition is entirely contradicted. Chalmers remarks, that the\r\nblack-faced animals superseded the goats, which were at one time a\r\nsource of subsistence to the farmers, and it is exceedingly probable,\r\nthat as the old white-faced began to change their appearance, and\r\nbecame gradually able to withstand the rigours of a mountain fare, and\r\nwinter under a dun skin, and short rough wool, so would they recommend\r\nthemselves as the best of all stock to the hard-driven agriculturalist.\r\n\r\n(72.) _Increase of the Number of the Horns._--As much wonder is sure to\r\nbe excited by the fact, that bony prominences are subjected with as\r\ngreat certainty to the modelling hand of climate as softer parts, I\r\ngive the following from a recent work, entitled, \"_Gardens and\r\nMenagerie of the Zoological Society Delineated_,\" premising, however,\r\nthat, in my opinion, temperature has a vast deal more to do with\r\nalterations in the horns than domestication or cultivation. \"One of the\r\nmost curious modifications produced by cultivation in the domesticated\r\nsheep consists in the augmentation of the number of its horns; two,\r\nthree, or even four supplementary appendages of this description being\r\noccasionally produced in addition to the normal number. Under these\r\ncircumstances the additional horns usually occupy the upper and fore\r\npart of the head, and are of a more slender shape, and take a more\r\nupright direction than the others, thus approaching in character to\r\nthose of the goats, while the true horns retain more or less of the\r\nspiral curve that distinguishes those of the sheep. There exists a\r\nstrong tendency to the propagation of this monstrosity, which is\r\nextremely frequent in the Asiatic races, but is also met with in a\r\nbreed that is common in the north of Europe, and is said to have been\r\noriginally derived from Iceland, and the Feroe Islands. In this case it\r\nis unconnected with any other anomaly, but in the flocks of the nomad\r\nhordes of Tartary, it is usually combined with an enlargement of the\r\ntail, and adjacent parts, by the deposition of fat, frequently to an\r\nenormous extent.\"\r\n\r\n(73.) _Causes of the various forms of the Horn._--Horns are seldom met\r\nwith in the sheep of hot climates, occurring more frequently in cold\r\nand temperate regions; thus following closely the development of the\r\nother coverings, to which, as before stated (19), they are strictly\r\nanalogous. The fleece consists of two portions--hair and wool, the one\r\npredominating more or less over the other, as the climate may direct.\r\nThe form of the horns is always in unison with the character of the\r\nfleece: thus, if the animal is covered with hair, as in the goat, the\r\nhorns will be straight; but if it is clothed with wool, as in the\r\nsheep, the horns will be curved. The same holds good in other animals.\r\nThe reason of this appears to lie in the tendency which the hair or\r\nwool, constituting the horny sheath, has to model the form of the\r\nsupporting bone. The fibre of hair is nearly straight; that of wool is,\r\non the other hand, remarkable for the number of tufted curls, or small\r\nspiral ringlets, into which it naturally contracts; so that a Merino\r\nram, for example, will never be found with rectilinear horns, nor a\r\ntrue goat with twisted ones. The truth of these remarks is borne out by\r\nobservations on animals on whose heads more than two horns are\r\noccasionally met with. We always in such instances notice, that the\r\nadditional horns are straight, thus indicating the presence of a\r\nconsiderable quantity of hair among the wool. The curve will be more\r\ndecided, and the twists more numerous, in proportion as the fibre comes\r\nnearer and nearer to a perfect wool--evidence of which we have in the\r\nbeautifully-tufted and spiral horns of the Merino ram, which are as\r\nopposite in this respect to those of the goat, as is its fleece to the\r\nhairy coat of the latter. From these considerations I am led to\r\nbelieve, that the form of the horn, when present, is an excellent guide\r\nto the nature and quality of the other coverings, and an index to every\r\ngradation which can possibly occur between wool and hair.\r\n\r\n(74.) _The proper Temperature required for Sheep._--Regular warmth is\r\nabsolutely necessary for the production of a good animal and a fine\r\nfleece, and is only to be obtained by attending to the draining and\r\nclearing of land, so as to dissipate moisture, and allow currents of\r\nair to play freely across the country.[12] An atmosphere which holds\r\nsuspended a large quantity of watery vapour, is always extremely\r\nchilling to an animal body. This is accounted for by the well-known\r\nfact, that a moist air, being a better conductor of caloric than a dry\r\none, robs an animal more quickly of heat. Thus, in passing from the dry\r\nair of the hills into the vapour of the valleys in a winter morning, we\r\nfeel as if the transition had been from a temperate to an icy region.\r\nHence one of the reasons why sheep thrive best in a rather elevated\r\nsituation. Moist air, however, is exceedingly oppressive in hot\r\nweather, because evaporation, from the surface of the body, is to a\r\ngreat extent diminished; and it is only by the perspiration being\r\nallowed to escape rapidly, and to convey away the heated particles,\r\nthat we can manage to be in any degree comfortable during the heat of\r\nsummer. This free evaporation we endeavour in every way to obtain, and\r\noften in a manner that ignorant people would consider as the reverse of\r\nsensible. It is well known that draughts of _cold liquids_ are very far\r\nfrom answering the purpose of lowering our temperature when above a\r\npleasant standard; but we find that a basin _of hot soup, or tea_, will\r\nspeedily bring about the desired end, by producing a copious\r\ndetermination of fluid to the skin. Yet, if the air contained no\r\nmoisture, we should experience sensations just as unpleasant as those\r\nalready mentioned; for evaporation from our bodies would proceed at\r\nsuch a rate, that we would soon be parched. It is to counteract this\r\ntendency of dry air that the Americans are in the habit of placing a\r\nsmall vessel of water on their stoves, by which contrivance a quantity\r\nof vapour is diffused through the apartment, sufficient to balance the\r\nloss from the arid warmth of the fire.\r\n\r\n        [12] It is to secure equality of temperature that the Spanish\r\n        flocks are twice in the year exposed to the hazard of an\r\n        overland journey of 400 miles, that they may pass the summer\r\n        in the mountains of the north, and the winter in the southern\r\n        plains.\r\n\r\nThat an equable temperature is only to be obtained by draining and\r\nclearing a marshy and wooded country, is sufficiently authenticated. In\r\nthe thickly wooded and swampy territories of Guiana, rain falls\r\ncontinually during nearly eight months of the year; and the cold is so\r\nintense, that fires are necessary in the houses throughout the night.\r\nBut in Cayenne and its neighbourhood, which were cleared of wood about\r\none hundred and fifty years ago, the increase of temperature is now so\r\ngreat, that during the night the people are annoyed by the warmth, and\r\nthe rains are neither so frequent nor so heavy as in the rest of the\r\ncountry. Paris and Quebec are nearly under the same latitude; yet the\r\nair of the latter is much colder than that of the former, evidently\r\nfrom its being surrounded by forests so dense and umbrageous, that sun\r\nand wind are alike denied access to the earth. The difference between a\r\ncleared and an uncleared country, in regard to wool, is well\r\nillustrated, by contrasting North America, its heavy woods and stagnant\r\natmosphere, with the thinly timbered surface and constantly renovated\r\nair of New South Wales. It is only within the last few years that\r\nCanada has been enabled to compete with Britain in the article of wool,\r\nand that the sheep, which were of the coarsest kind, have been so\r\nimproved as to do away with the prejudices against their mutton.\r\nAustralia, on the other hand, has, from its earliest colonization,\r\nfigured as a sheep-rearing country of the first importance; and nothing\r\nhas conduced so much to this as its freedom from closely planted trees,\r\nby the absence of which the settler is enabled at once to stock his\r\nfarm with the best of sheep. Nature, in fact, could never have intended\r\nsheep to pasture in a wooded country, as is clearly evinced by their\r\ncoat, to which every thing in the shape of bush or tree is in the\r\nhighest degree inimical.\r\n\r\n(75.) _Geographical limits of the Sheep._--Every plant and animal has\r\ncertain geographical limits, out of which it cannot exist. With the\r\nexception of man and the dog, no animal has a wider range than the\r\nsheep, extending as it does from Iceland almost to the equator, and\r\nfrom a few degrees south of that to the polar extremity of South\r\nAmerica. But though existing under so great a variety of exposures, it\r\nmust not be inferred that it can come to perfection in them all. On the\r\ncontrary, it rather delights in the temperate zones, and can evidently\r\nonly be raised to its highest point of excellence in the countries of\r\nthe vine. The western parts of continents produce better sheep than the\r\neastern, and the southern hemisphere better than the northern; as in\r\nthe former situations the temperature is more nearly equable than in\r\nthe latter. The same may be said of maritime districts, as compared\r\nwith such as are inland. Temperature is affected in the same way by\r\nelevation as by northern or southern position--the mean heat\r\ndiminishing in the same ratio when ascending a mountain, as in receding\r\nfrom the equator. On this account, Humboldt compared the earth to two\r\nmountains with their bases at the equator, and their summits at the\r\npoles. The mean temperature, when resulting from the height of the\r\nplace above the level of the sea, is at the same time influenced by the\r\nnature of the aspect, as we notice in the Alps, where the Glacier\r\nexists on the northern side, at the same elevation at which the\r\nvineyard yields a perfect fruit upon the southern.\r\n\r\n(76.) _Particular forms induced by certain limits._--The character\r\nwhich a predominance of heat, or cold, impresses on the animal as a\r\nwhole, extends also to individual parts of the body. The sheep of South\r\nAfrica are, as all the world know, remarkable for the magnitude of the\r\ntail, which forms an immense fatty appendage. The sheep of Persia,\r\nTartary, and China, are distinguished from all others by the tail\r\nforming a _double globe_ of fat. The North of Europe, and North of\r\nAsia, are overrun by a breed in which the tail is almost wanting, while\r\nthat of Southern Russia, India, and Guinea, stands pre-eminent from the\r\nelongation of the tail, and, in respect to that of the two last named\r\nplaces, also of the legs.\r\n\r\n(77.) _Influence of vegetation on form and disposition._--Vegetation\r\ninfluences, to a great extent, the form and disposition of the animal.\r\nSuch changes may be brought about either by the plenty, or scarceness,\r\nof the herbage; or by the nature of the country on which that herbage\r\nis produced. Animals found on hilly countries are always widely\r\ndifferent from those of the plains. Their bodies are light, their legs\r\nlong, and their habits of that unquiet kind which renders them hostile\r\nto any thing like restraint. It is for these reasons, that when once a\r\nflock attaches itself to a range of hills, and becomes suited to the\r\nmeans of subsistence, it may preserve itself for ages apart from\r\nneighbouring varieties, and present, after a long series of years,\r\nthose qualities in their native purity for which it was noted by the\r\nearliest observers. The sheep of a level country are distinguished, on\r\nthe contrary, by heavy bodies, short legs, and easy tempers. They are,\r\nin fact, constructed on Dutch proportions, and are imbued, as a natural\r\nconsequence, with those imperturbable and steady-going habits so\r\ncharacteristic of the bulbous bottomed Hollander. Subdued as they are\r\nby the nature of their locality, they readily submit to man, who tutors\r\nthem at will, and works on them those profitable changes from which\r\nhave originated our improved varieties. As connected with the unquiet\r\ndispositions of hill sheep, I may mention the prevalence of a notion,\r\nthat domesticated sheep cannot by any possibility become wild. From all\r\nthat I have seen, and read, I am led to believe, though the sheep,\r\naccording to Greek, Roman, and Oriental philosophers, was the first\r\nanimal domesticated, that when at liberty it will soon return to its\r\nprimitive and instinctive habits. Bonnycastle, in his work on Spanish\r\nAmerica, remarks, that sheep are found in a state of nature, in the\r\nnorthern parts of New Spain, \"having multiplied to an extraordinary\r\ndegree in the wide-spread plains, and savannahs.\" In ascending our\r\nScottish mountains, every one must observe the state bordering upon\r\nwildness, in which the sheep appear, roving in detached but well-led\r\nparties; bounding away to the most inaccessible places on the approach\r\nof danger, and peering from the eminences in all the pride of scornful\r\nindependence. Professor Blumenbach at one time doubted the possibility\r\nof domestic sheep ever becoming wild; but his opinion was changed on\r\nperusing the work of Vincentius, where there occurs a remarkable\r\npassage, in which Nearchus, when speaking of the desert island of\r\nCataia, on the coast of Caramania, says, that the inhabitants of the\r\nneighbouring islands yearly carried thither sheep, as offerings to\r\nVenus and Mercury, and that, in course of time, they became wild in the\r\ndeserts.[13] Constant attendance is, therefore, called for on the part\r\nof man, to ensure that untroubled reliance on his care so conducive to\r\nthe welfare of the flock, for even on a temporary cessation of his\r\nprotection, those instincts, which can be subdued but not eradicated,\r\nare brought into operation, and their presence will go far to retard\r\nthe advancement of those qualities, on the perfection of which a profit\r\ncan alone be hoped for.\r\n\r\n        [13] Edin. Philosophical Journal.\r\n\r\n(78.) _Breeds required for Britain._--Of the numerous breeds at\r\npresent in our island, a few only are indispensably necessary for the\r\ncontinuance of its prosperity. These stand, according to Marshall,\r\nthus:--A very long-woolled sheep, as the Lincolnshire, or Teeswater,\r\nfor the richest grass lands, and finest worsted manufactures--the New\r\nLeicester, for less fertile grass land, and for rich enclosed arable\r\nland, on which the fold is not used; intended to supply coarser\r\nworsted, stockings, coarse cloths, blankets, and carpets--a\r\nmiddle-woolled breed, as the Wiltshire, the Norfolk, or the Southdown,\r\nfor arable lands on which folding is practised, and for cloths of\r\nmiddle qualities--a fine-woolled, as the Ryeland, for the finest\r\ncloths; and a hardy race for heathy mountains.\r\n\r\nSome argue, and rightly, that only three breeds are necessary for\r\nScotland, inasmuch as only three are required by the nature of the\r\ncountry. Scotland may be regarded, in an agricultural point of view,\r\nas divided into highland, upland, and plain. The highland consists of\r\nprimitive rocks, covered by peaty soil and heath, on which these\r\nindefatigable gleaners, the black-faced sheep, alone can gain a\r\nsubsistence. The upland is formed by the transition series of rocks,\r\ncovered with grass; and to it the Cheviots appear indigenous. The\r\nplain is formed by alluvial deposits, covered with rich pasture, and\r\ncapable of supporting races of large sheep, as the Leicesters.\r\n\r\nSheep are the only kind of live-stock which ought to be kept in\r\nmountainous districts, especially when green crop cannot be\r\ncultivated. Sheep-farming must necessarily prevail in the Highlands,\r\nwhere there are few tracts suited for the pasturage of black cattle:\r\nThe value of its adaptation to the natural circumstances of that\r\ndistrict is proved by the rapid progress which it made, and the\r\nprofits which resulted to the individuals with whom it originated.\r\nPlaces which formerly were not of the slightest utility, now yielded\r\nheavy rents. The spots among the mountains, susceptible of\r\ncultivation, were found to be advantageously kept in grass, to serve\r\nas pasture for the flock during the rigour of winter, and it was well\r\nascertained that more than double rent might be paid by stocking with\r\nsheep in preference to cattle.\r\n\r\nThe Dishley sheep are excellent specimens of what may be done with the\r\nform of an animal, when the endeavours of the breeder are seconded by\r\na pasture suitable for the intended breed. They are admirably adapted,\r\nas every breed ought to be, to the soil and situation where they were\r\ncalled into existence; and their crosses are now spread over most part\r\nof the country; principally the corn districts, as they are supposed\r\nto be the most profitable kind on farms where the best tillage crops\r\nare combined with the fattening of livestock, though Marshall supposes\r\nthey will only be reckoned profitable so long as other breeds of\r\nlong-woolled sheep remain with thin chines, and loose mutton; or, in\r\nother words, that there are plenty of kinds which would prove equal,\r\nif not superior, to the present, if they only received the same\r\nstudied attention.\r\n\r\n(79.) _Varied nature of the food of Sheep._--Sheep will take,\r\nsometimes from choice, sometimes from necessity, to food of a directly\r\nopposite nature to what they have been used. \"The mutton,\" says the\r\nRev. George Low, writing of Orkney, \"is here in general but ordinary,\r\nowing to the sheep feeding much on sea-ware, to procure which these\r\ncreatures show a wonderful sagacity, for no sooner has the tide of ebb\r\nbegun to run, but they, though at a great distance, immediately betake\r\nthemselves full speed, one and all, to the shore, where they continue\r\ntill it begins to flow.\" The sheep of Iceland are content during\r\nsevere winters to feed, and be preserved, on messes of chopped\r\nfish-bones, being all that the ingenuity of their masters can provide\r\nin the way of a precarious sustenance. During the long continuance of\r\nsnow-storms, when the herbage is beyond the reach of their utmost\r\nefforts, sheep are known to devour the wool on each other's backs,\r\nand, in some instances to acquire a relish for this unnatural food,\r\nwhich adheres to them through life. This, though on first thoughts\r\nhardly credible, is scarcely more wonderful than the partiality which\r\ncows display, when instigated by the depraved appetites created by\r\npregnancy, for blankets, and any similar domestic articles which may\r\nbe exposed to the gratification of their longings.\r\n\r\nThe Puruk sheep of Ladusk, in the Himalaya mountains, is, as described\r\nby Mr Moorecraft, in the _Transactions of the Asiatic Society_, in\r\nrespect to the varied nature of its food, a most remarkable animal.\r\n\"The Puruk sheep, if permitted, thrusts its head into the cooking pot,\r\npicks up crumbs, is eager to drink the remains of a cup of broth, and\r\nexamine the hand of its master for barley, flour, or a cleanly picked\r\nbone, which it disdains not to nibble; a leaf of lettuce, a peeling of\r\nturnip, the skin of the apricot, give a luxury; and the industry is\r\nindefatigable with which this animal detects, and appropriates\r\nsubstances, so minute and uninviting as would be unseen and neglected\r\nby ordinary sheep; perhaps the dog of the cottager is not so\r\ncompletely domesticated as it is.\" That Mr Moorecraft is correct in\r\nthis statement of its omnivorous propensities, there cannot be the\r\nslightest doubt, as any farmer can testify from what he has seen of\r\nlambs reared by children for amusement. The celebrated John Hunter\r\nshowed, that a pigeon might be made to live on flesh, and that its\r\nstomach became adapted to the nature of this food: and I have\r\nsomewhere read of a sheep, which, after being long on ship-board, and\r\naccustomed, from scarcity of vegetables, to an animal diet, could\r\nnever after be prevailed upon to take to grass. Nor need these\r\ncircumstances excite surprise, since the food of every living creature\r\nis, for a certain period at the commencement of existence, limited to\r\nsuch as is purely animal. But to keep to our subject. Those in the\r\nhabit of opening the stomachs of sheep, must have remarked the eroded\r\nappearance which the inner coat occasionally presents. This phenomenon\r\nis owing to the action of the gastric juice, which, if competent to\r\nturn at once from the food with which it is mingled to attack the\r\ntexture which has secreted it, will also be, during life, capable of\r\ndigesting with tolerable ease, such dead animal matter as may be\r\nbrought into contact with it.\r\n\r\nIn regard to vegetable food, they will, when necessary, devour such as\r\nis even of an acrid nature, and calculated to poison any animals but\r\nthemselves. Thunberg, while in Southern Africa, frequently noticed\r\nsheep eating, with impunity, the _Mortimia acris_, the _Rhus lucidum_,\r\nand the _Lycium afrum_, which are all of a poisonous nature; and, in\r\nthis country, hemlock is known to be quite innocuous to sheep. What is\r\npoison to one animal often constitutes a wholesome food for others,\r\nand that which will, when given in immediate large doses, destroy an\r\nanimal, will, when taken in a gradually-increasing allowance, prove\r\nextremely salutary.\r\n\r\n(80.) _Influence of the food on the quality of Mutton._--Diet has a\r\npowerful influence on the constituents of the body. A rank succulent\r\npasture taints the flesh, or renders it insipid and unpleasant, while\r\na dry aromatic herbage communicates a delightful flavour, and enables\r\npeople versed in the pleasures of the table easily to discriminate\r\nbetween turnip-fed and grass-fed mutton; and again, between the\r\nlatter, and that which has spent its existence on the hills. In\r\nTouchwood's Syllabus of Culinary Lectures, appended to the _Cook and\r\nHousewive's Manual_, by Mistress Dods, we are briefly informed, that\r\n\"the black-faced, or short-sheep, are best for the table, though _more\r\ndepends on the pasture than the breed_.\" More, in fact, depending on\r\nfeeding and management, than on the variety of the animal, though this\r\nof course is not to be neglected. A notion has been advanced in this\r\ncountry, that artificial pastures are less nutritious than natural\r\nones, and that the animals which are raised upon them are,\r\nconsequently, of a laxer fibre, and the flesh less wholesome, as well\r\nas less savoury. This, I have no doubt, is perfectly correct, as many\r\n_diseases_ may be traced to such improper food, and what is calculated\r\nto produce in some cases actual disease, cannot fail to prove at all\r\ntimes capable of retarding the advancement of the animal. These soft\r\nsucculent pastures appear not to be positively poisonous, but to be\r\nnegatively so from their deficiency in saline matter; the rapid growth\r\nof the plant preventing the elimination and absorption, of many of\r\nthese ingredients with which the soil abounds. This is proved by the\r\ngreater necessity which exists for the use of salt in the food of the\r\nherbivorous animals of hot climates, than in that of such as inhabit\r\ntemperate, or cold latitudes; vegetation being in the former more\r\nrapid in its details, and in certain states of the atmosphere hurried\r\nin the extreme, while in the latter the process proceeds with that\r\nleisure which enables the plant to make good the measure of its\r\nconstituents, as it increases in size. In many parts of North America\r\nit is well known, that, at certain seasons, the wild animals make\r\neagerly for the salt _licks_; and, following up this hint, the\r\nsettlers easily induce their oxen to keep near their dwellings, by\r\nserving them periodically with salt. When the wild cattle of South\r\nAmerica had greatly increased, it was discovered that they could not\r\nexist unless they had access to streams which had acquired brackish\r\nparticles from the soil. _If salt, in places devoid of it, was not\r\nfurnished to them by man, they became stunted, unfruitful, and the\r\nherds soon disappeared._ Even in this country, the free use of salt is\r\nfound to be highly beneficial to our domestic animals, preventing the\r\noccurrence of many of those diseases which are otherwise sure to\r\nfollow the use of food such as is mentioned above, and ensuring that\r\nsound health which is so conducive to the accumulation of fat.\r\n\r\n(81.) _Differences in the quality of Mutton._--I shall now enter a\r\nlittle into the manner in which the _quality_ of the flesh may be\r\naffected, and the methods of judging of the different states or\r\nconditions, in which it may be found under various circumstances;\r\npremising that it requires much experience, to enable a person to\r\npronounce with confidence, as to the value of the muscular parts, from\r\nthe inspection of a living animal:--The flesh of different specimens\r\nof the same animal, varies not so much from breed or descent, as from\r\nage, feeding, and exercise. That of the young is soft and gelatinous,\r\nthe fibres being small, weak, and much interspersed with a substance\r\ntermed, from its loose appearance, cellular tissue. This tissue\r\nexhibits in the spaces between the muscles (_layers of flesh_) small\r\nmasses of delicate fat. The greater bulk of the latter is situated\r\nimmediately beneath the skin, and occasions that beautiful rotundity\r\nso much admired in children. As the animal advances in life, the\r\nfibres become firmer, larger, and more approximated, the cellular\r\ntissue disappears to a great extent, the fat shifts from the outward\r\nto the inward parts, allowing the outline of the muscles to be\r\ndistinctly seen, but giving at the same time to the figure that portly\r\nsymptom of good keeping, so unpleasant to the eye when carried to the\r\nextent of Aldermanic dignity. All these appearances are, however,\r\nvaried by exercise, which tends, in a marked degree, to increase the\r\nmuscular parts at the expense of the fat--the former becoming, when\r\nemployed within proper limits, large, and unyielding to the touch,\r\nwhile at the same time the colour is heightened from a pale or purple\r\nhue, to the bright vermilion so justly relied upon by housewives, as a\r\nguarantee for the superior qualities of the article. The wild horses\r\nin South America, which form the principal part of Indian diet, are\r\nsaid by these epicures to be much improved for the table by gentle\r\nlabour, and to be quite on a par when thus cared for, with some of our\r\nbest beef. This plan is, however, only pursued for the purpose of\r\nrendering the flesh of their horses moderately firm; but where an\r\nopposite effect is desired it is readily, though cruelly, produced by\r\nputting the animal to a lingering death; examples of which practice\r\nare to be met with in the annals of most civilized nations; as in the\r\nGerman mode of whipping pigs, and the English custom of baiting\r\nbulls;[14] both tending to the same end, by so exhausting vital\r\ncontractibility as to prevent its last and faint display in the\r\nstiffening of the carcass.\r\n\r\n        [14] By the old English law, no bull beef could be sold unless\r\n        the bull had been baited.\r\n\r\nMarshall, who touches very slightly on the subject, says, \"The flesh\r\nof sheep when slaughtered is well known to be of various qualities:\r\nsome is composed of large coarse grains, interspersed with wide empty\r\npores, like a sponge; others of large grains, with wide pores filled\r\nwith fat; others of fine close grains with smaller pores filled with\r\nfat; and a fourth of close grains without any mixture of fatness. The\r\nflesh of sheep when dressed is equally well known to possess a variety\r\nof qualities: some mutton is coarse, dry, and insipid,--a dry sponge\r\naffording little or no gravy of any colour. Another sort is somewhat\r\nfirmer, imparting a light-coloured gravy only. A third plump, short,\r\nand palatable, affording a mixture of white and red gravy. A fourth\r\nlikewise plump, and well-flavoured, but discharging red gravy only,\r\nand this in various quantities. It is likewise observable that some\r\nmutton, when dressed, appears covered with a thick, tough,\r\nparchment-like integument; others with a membrane comparatively fine\r\nand flexible.\" This membrane ought to be rather thin than thick, as,\r\nwhen of the latter texture, you may safely affirm that the animal was\r\naged. _Looseness_ is reckoned a bad quality of the flesh of sheep\r\nduring life, as indicating a coarse-grained porous mutton, and as\r\nequally exceptionable with that of _hardness_: while _mellowness_, and\r\nfirmness, are much to be desired, as forming a happy mixture, deemed\r\nby some the point of perfection. The tendency to become fat at an\r\nearly age, though a valuable one in some points, is not so in others.\r\nPremature decay is always the result, showing with certainty that a\r\nhealthy action has not been going on. An animal when _loaded_ with fat\r\ncannot be looked upon otherwise than as in a diseased state, and\r\nliable to embarassment of many organs, especially of the heart and\r\nbrain. Sudden death on any hurried exertion is far from rare, and\r\nlife, from the difficulty of enjoying it, is any thing but desirable.\r\n\r\n(82.) _Abuses in Feeding._--The custom of over-feeding was carried to\r\nan absurd extent on the promulgation of Bakewell's method, nothing\r\nless being aspired to than the glory of laying seven or eight inches\r\nof fat on the ribs of sheep. This folly however had its day: the\r\nridiculous parts of the system have to a great extent disappeared,\r\nwhile attention to the production of an increased quantity of mutton,\r\nwithout too great an abundance of fat, has remained to prove to the\r\nworld the value of the benefits which the English farmer conferred\r\nupon his country. Overgrown sheep are indeed good for nothing \"save\"\r\nin the words of Meg Dods, \"to obtain premiums at cattle shows, and\r\ndeluge dripping-pans with liquid fat;\" and in this every one will\r\nagree, excepting always boarding-school cooks, and others who depend\r\nfor their principal perquisites on the over-roasting of oily meat! The\r\nfat, though not reckoned as offal in the slaughter-house, will\r\nspeedily show itself as such in the kitchen, by the waste during the\r\ncooking process, even in England where fat meat is so much admired;\r\nand it is surely absurd to pay the price of good mutton for tallow,\r\nwhen if the latter were really wanted, it could be procured at a\r\ncheaper rate by itself, than when forming part of a dear commodity.\r\nThe only way in which over-fat meat can at all be reckoned profitable,\r\nis in its application to the wants of the working classes, whose\r\nbodily labour enables them to enjoy what would to others prove\r\ndispleasing in the extreme, and to digest and assimilate with ease,\r\nfood which to the sons of sloth would prove a poison. So far as these\r\nwants have been supplied, the attempt of Bakewell has been attended\r\nwith the happiest results, as he and his disciples have placed by\r\ntheir well-spent exertions much good food within the reach of the\r\npoorer classes, which they must otherwise have gone without; while in\r\nmany instances it has driven bacon from the market, being a cheaper\r\nand more palatable commodity, which cannot but contribute to the\r\nhealth of the people, seeing the continued use of salted meat is\r\ncalculated to injure the body, and render it liable to many diseases.\r\nMarshall remarks, that fat, like charity, covers a multitude of\r\nfaults: and he is right, for an ill-shaped animal if well fed, has all\r\nits angles speedily effaced, and if its ugliness has not amounted to\r\nabsolute deformity, it acquires that rotundity of contour so pleasing\r\nto the eye, and so apt to mislead us.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity is various with which animals take on fat, much depending\r\non hereditary predisposition, and the nature of the food; and much\r\nalso on the state of the atmosphere, and quiet habits; a moist and\r\nrather warm air tending greatly to the advancement of the process,\r\nsome birds becoming fat in twenty-four hours of wet weather. Children\r\nthat have been emaciated by diseases often resume their original plump\r\ncondition in a few days; and animals that have been famished, as hogs,\r\nafterwards fatten very rapidly. Moderate and repeated bleedings, mild\r\nfarinaceous diet, and emasculation conjoined, tend to the repletion of\r\nthe body, and to the speedy deposition of fat; yet it would appear,\r\nthat when acquired in this rapid manner, it never possesses the value\r\nin a culinary point of view, that is yielded to such as has been\r\nslowly formed, when, as one may say, the worthless particles have had\r\ntime to be removed, and the remaining part to become a firm and\r\nhealthy deposit. It is partly owing to this, that animals are never at\r\ntheir best when forced to take on fat at an early age, but are most\r\nesteemed by the gourmand when they, as in the case of the sheep, have\r\nlived from three to four years.\r\n\r\n(83.) _Tendency to acquire Fat._--A disposition to early obesity, as\r\nwell as a tendency to that form which indicates a propensity to\r\nfatten, is materially promoted by a good supply of rich food, while\r\nthe animal is in a growing state. The Spanish shepherds are so well\r\naware of this, that half of the lambs are annually killed, that the\r\nsurvivors may obtain every indulgence in the way of milk. Care should\r\nbe taken never to place animals suddenly on food much superior in\r\nfeeding qualities to what they have left. Very lean sheep are never\r\nput to full turnips in winter, nor to rich pastures in summer, but are\r\nprepared for turnips on good grass lands, and kept on second years'\r\nleys, and afterwards given a moderate allowance of turnips if they are\r\nto be fatted on pastures. It is an invariable rule with all good\r\nmanagers, never to allow this or any other animal, reared solely for\r\nthe shambles, to lose flesh from its earliest age till it is sent to\r\nthe butcher as more food is necessary to bring it to a certain\r\ncondition than to keep it at it. In the case of the Dishleys, it is\r\ncustomary to keep all in a state of fatness, except those intended for\r\nbreeding, and after full feeding on turnips during winter and spring,\r\nto finish them on the first year's clover early in summer, when the\r\nprices of meat are usually the highest; so that this variety is always\r\nfit for market at eighteen months, while the Highland breeds, though\r\nprepared by means of turnips, a year at least, sooner than in former\r\ntimes, do not usually go to the shambles till from three to four years\r\nold.\r\n\r\n(84.) _Frequent change of Pasture necessary._--Sheep ought never to be\r\npermitted to remain too long on one pasture:--Great benefit will be\r\nderived from their removal from time to time to different parts even\r\nof the same farm, by which arrangement a change of herbage will be\r\nensured. No animal can be kept for any length of time in health, if\r\nrestricted to one unvarying routine of diet. This has been\r\nsatisfactorily proved by the experiments of Majendie, who found that\r\nhealth could not be sustained on one or even two kinds of food beyond\r\nthe thirtieth day. Now, though such immediate injury cannot result to\r\na flock from retention on a particular pasture, owing to the variety\r\nof sustenance being considerable, yet proportional harm will ensue\r\nsufficient to induce us not to repeat the risk. Nature, the best of\r\nguides in all that relates to the protection of her creatures, is no\r\nwhere more pointed in her directions than on this head. A necessity\r\nfor a variety of food, and a desire to secure it, are implanted in the\r\ndisposition of every animal; and where is the creature more prone to\r\nextensive rambles than the sheep? We limit it to a paltry\r\npasture-ground of roods and acres, but does it not show, by its\r\ndetermination to transgress our barriers, that such is not the\r\ntreatment nature has designed for it? There is something more than\r\nwildness of character, and restless disposition, in the powerful\r\nattempts it continually makes to defy our artificial boundaries. There\r\nis in these efforts a longing for fresh fields and other herbage, an\r\ninstinctive feeling that all is not as it ought to be; and yet we\r\nattend not to the hint! Nothing will conduce so much to the health of\r\nthe sheep, and to the speedy taking on of fat, as the frequent\r\nshifting of the flock. Disease will doubtless still affect the\r\nanimals, but illness will be rare, and mortality diminished, if by the\r\ncare of their rulers, they are enabled to obtain what instinct tells\r\nthem is the best of medicine.\r\n\r\n(85.) _Varieties induced by apparently trivial causes._--Surrounded in\r\na civilized state, by all that can minister to the supply of wants,\r\nwhether real or supposed, man is not on that account to be imagined as\r\nalways so situated. Look to savage nations, and remark their destitute\r\ncondition, their dependence on the uncertain proceeds of the chase,\r\nand their reliance on modes of agriculture as unprofitable as they are\r\nunmatured. Countries there are certainly to be found, where the\r\n\"elements of temperature,\" are so fortunately balanced and combined as\r\nto produce only good effects, and in which the rude inhabitants reap\r\nthe fruits of a spontaneous plenty; but these form only a small\r\nproportion of the globe, and in most regions man must give his\r\nunceasing endeavours to the cultivation of a plant or animal, before\r\nhe can raise it from the miniature condition in which he finds it, to\r\nsuch a size and richness as will satisfy his wants. Nor need we go far\r\nfor illustrations. The crab has been transformed into the apple, and\r\nthe sloe into the plum. None of our cereal grasses, as now cultivated,\r\nare to be met with in a wild state; they have evidently been brought\r\nto their present fulness by the care of ages. The red cabbage and the\r\ncauliflower are the altered descendants of a widely different sea-side\r\nplant. The different races of cabbages are examples of a wonderful\r\ndeviation from the natural type, and they all require much nicety in\r\ncultivation to prevent them assuming the characters of the original\r\nstock, as, when permitted to grow wild, especially on a sterile soil\r\nas that of the sea coast, they are sure in no long time to become\r\nexact counterparts of their originals. Cultivation, also, though taken\r\nin rather a different sense, influences to a great extent the form and\r\nfeatures of animals. In proof of this may be adduced the differences\r\nthat exist between different ranks of inhabitants in almost all\r\ncountries. Buffon says, that in France you may distinguish by their\r\naspect not only the nobles from the peasantry, but the superior orders\r\nof nobility from the inferior--these from citizens, and citizens from\r\npeasants. The African field-slaves in America, are extremely different\r\nfrom the domestic servants of the former nation, retaining as they do\r\ntheir original peculiarities from poor living and degrading duties;\r\nwhile the latter have nearly approached to the habits and modes of\r\nthinking of their masters, from living with them, and being well\r\ntreated under the same roof. \"The South Sea islanders,\" says Dr\r\nElliotson, \"who appear to be all of one family, vary according to\r\ntheir degree of cultivation. The New Zealanders, for example, are\r\nsavages, and chiefly black; the New Hollanders half civilized, and\r\nchiefly tawny; the Friendly islanders are more advanced, and not quite\r\nso dark; several are lighter than olive colour, and hundreds of\r\nEuropean faces are found among them.\" Indeed the examples are almost\r\nendless which I could bring forward to aid my explanations; but these\r\nit would be needless to give, since it is in the power of every one to\r\nstudy the differences in form and features of the classes of society\r\nin our own island, and by so doing understand the influence of\r\notherwise trivial and unimportant circumstances, on an animal at all\r\ntimes so easily moulded to situation as the sheep.\r\n\r\n(86.) _Varieties from mode of Breeding._--Changes are wrought for the\r\nmost part by attention to the mode of propagation of the plant or\r\nanimal, by the plan of crossing; and by careful selection of the\r\nparent stock. Every one must be struck with the varieties constantly\r\noccurring in the vegetable world: Flowers change their colours, and\r\nbecome double; and these characters can be perpetuated by seed.\r\nHedge-row plants may be observed to vary even in the limits of an\r\nordinary walk, and to be continued as varieties so long as they remain\r\nin the same locality. The following striking example of the extent to\r\nwhich plants may be made to vary by altering their circumstances, is\r\nrelated by Mr Herbert in the _Horticultural Transactions_, vol.\r\niv:--\"I raised from the natural seed of an umbel of a highly manured\r\nred cowslip, a primrose, a cowslip, oxlips of the usual and other\r\ncolours, a black polyanthus, a hose-in-hose cowslip, and a natural\r\nprimrose bearing its flower on a polyanthus stalk. From the seed of\r\nthat very hose-in-hose cowslip, I have since raised a hose-in-hose\r\nprimrose. I therefore consider all these to be only local varieties,\r\ndepending upon soil and situation.\" \"Fifty years ago,\" says Buffon\r\n(writing in 1749), \"our pot-herbs consisted of a single species of\r\nsuccory, and two of lettuce, both very bad; but we have now more than\r\nfifty kinds of lettuce and succory, all of which are good. Our best\r\nfruits and nuts, which are so different from those formerly cultivated\r\nthat they have no resemblance but in the name, must likewise be\r\nreferred to a very modern date. In general, substances remain, and\r\nnames change with times: but in this case names remain, and substances\r\nare changed. Our peaches, our apricots, our pears, are new productions\r\nwith ancient names. To remove every doubt upon this subject, we have\r\nonly to compare our flowers and fruits with the descriptions, or\r\nrather notices of them transmitted to us by the Greeks and Romans. All\r\ntheir flowers were single, and all their fruit-trees were wild stocks,\r\nand their species very ill-chosen. Their fruits of course, were small,\r\ndry, sour, and had neither the flavour nor the beauty of ours. These\r\nnew and good species originally sprung from the wild kinds; but how\r\nmany times have their seeds been sown before this happy effect was\r\nproduced? It was only by sowing and rearing an infinite number of\r\nvegetables of the same species, that some individuals were recognized\r\nto bear better and more succulent fruit than others; and this first\r\ndiscovery, which supposes much care and observation, would have\r\nremained for ever useless if a second had not been made, which implies\r\nan equal degree of genius as the first required of patience--I mean\r\nthe mode of multiplying by engrafting those precious individuals which\r\nunfortunately cannot propagate or transmit their excellent qualities\r\nto their posterity. * * * In the animal kingdom, most of those\r\nqualities which appear to be individual are propagated and transmitted\r\nin the same manner as their specific qualities. It was therefore more\r\neasy for man to have influence upon the nature of animals than upon\r\nthat of vegetables. Particular races in any species of animals, are\r\nonly constant varieties, which are perpetuated by generation. But in\r\nthe vegetable kingdom there are no races, no varieties so constant as\r\nto be perpetuated by reproduction. In the species of the hen and\r\npigeon, a great number of races have been very lately produced, all of\r\nwhich propagate their kinds. In other species, we daily rear and\r\nimprove races by crossing the breeds.\"\r\n\r\n(87.) _Breeding in-and-in._--Though there are several methods pursued\r\nby breeders for the improvement of flocks, the one most in vogue is,\r\nthat of choosing individuals of the same family, and breeding\r\n_in-and-in_. It is however a plan requiring, for the safety of the\r\nflock, either very great skill in selecting the males and females, or\r\nonly to be followed to a very limited extent. No subject ever called\r\nforth so much random controversy, and no evil has ever so clearly\r\nshown itself as such; yet it is only recently, that people have opened\r\nthe intellectual eye to the dangers of a practice, against which the\r\nablest pens were long and vainly blunted. The object of breeding\r\n_in-and-in_ is to strengthen good qualities and get rid of bad ones,\r\nas speedily as possible; and it is plain, that if we happen to select\r\nanimals with slight imperfections, these imperfections will become\r\nhereditary, and will go on assuming a worse and worse type till the\r\nbreed be destroyed. Culley, however, was of opinion, that less risk is\r\nrun by breeding _in-and-in_ than is generally supposed, and instances\r\nthe wild cattle in Chillingham Park, in the county of Northumberland,\r\nwhich, having been confined for several hundred years without\r\nintermixture, must have bred from the nearest affinities, and yet are\r\njust as they were five hundred years since. With all due deference,\r\nhowever, to the opinion of the late Mr Culley, I must assert, that I\r\ncannot perceive in what manner wild cattle can be made to illustrate\r\nthe case in point, as it must be evident, that animals in a state of\r\nnature differ essentially from those in charge of man, in regard to\r\nthe propagation of infirmities, as the former, if born with a radical\r\ndefect, will, ten to one, never see the age which suits them for\r\nreproduction; while the latter, from the care bestowed upon them,\r\nwill, even when very delicate, in many instances be bolstered up till\r\nthey have entailed upon posterity an accumulation of their already\r\naggravated maladies. The system of breeding _in-and-in_ proves, in\r\nfact, as destructive to flocks, as marriages of near relations to the\r\nhuman kind. We would not witness an every-day entailment of diseases,\r\nif people would forego their unnatural love of money, and cease their\r\nendeavours to keep it in \"the family,\" by forming matrimonial\r\nalliances with those who are near of kin. The law of God forbids us to\r\nwed those who stand in certain degrees of propinquity; but, if we and\r\nour descendants avail ourselves of the limits of this law, and marry\r\non its verge a certain number of times, misery must infallibly be the\r\nlot even of the tenth generation; and instead of being fathers of a\r\nmighty people, few and full of sorrow will be the days of our\r\nchildren; while in place of retaining in their possession our darling\r\nwealth, it will, ere long, pass into the hand of the stranger.\r\n\r\n(88.) _Opponents of in-and-in breeding._--Different individuals at\r\nvarious times, and in widely separate places, have by their\r\nobservations rendered the criminal absurdity of this system perfectly\r\napparent to all, who, unbiased by party principle, are anxious for a\r\nknowledge of the truth. A few of these I shall mention. Ezra\r\nL'Hommedieu, Vice-president of the Agricultural Society of New York,\r\ncollected, in the year 1800, a great many observations on the breeding\r\nof sheep, and came to the conclusion, that changing and crossing the\r\nbreed of the animals is a matter of great importance, in preventing a\r\ndwindling and degeneracy of the flock. Dr Coventry, in his pamphlet on\r\n_Live-Stock_, gives it as his opinion, that \"The most perfect race of\r\nanimals may be debased by improper mixture, or injured by improper\r\ntreatment. Indiscriminate matches in breeding, and inattentive\r\nmanagement in rearing, are alike capable of producing a worthless\r\nprogeny.\" Here the matter is made very plain, from comparing an evil,\r\nthe progress of which is insidious, with the injurious consequences,\r\nwhich the most unobserving can easily trace to a parallel neglect. Mr\r\nDick of Edinburgh, so well known for the valuable and trustworthy\r\ninformation he has accumulated, has been informed by eminent farmers,\r\n\"that cattle bred _in-and-in_, are very subject to _clyers_ in the\r\nthroat after they have attained their first year.\" By clyers are meant\r\nenlarged lymphatic glands, which are a sure sign of what is termed a\r\nscrofulous habit, a breaking up of the constitution, which, though\r\nproduced by a variety of causes, is yet frequently the result of an\r\n\"_owr sib_\" connection. These are, I may say, the accidental opinions\r\nof men who had no point to make good, in which their credit was at all\r\nat stake, and who are not endeavouring to support the crude opinions\r\nof former years. For these reasons, they possess a value which ought\r\nto give them a proportional weight in an investigation like the\r\npresent. Mr Bakewell succeeded in bringing his sheep to great\r\nperfection as regards form, and rapidity of fattening, by breeding in\r\nthe same family for a great many years; but it was attended with\r\nconsiderable deterioration in the quality of the wool, and engendered\r\na liability to disease, sufficient to deter any one from proceeding a\r\nsimilar length in the same track, to what is so dubiously called\r\nimprovement. See what Mr Dickson says to this effect, in a recent\r\nnumber of the _Quarterly Journal of Agriculture_. \"The evil of\r\nbreeding _in-and-in_, or in other words, producing too great\r\nrefinement of tone, is manifested in the first instance by a\r\ntenderness of constitution; the animals not being able to withstand\r\nthe extremes of heat and cold, rain and drought. If the evil is\r\nprolonged through several generations, the forms of the animals become\r\naffected, the bone becomes very small, the neck droops, the skin of\r\nthe head becomes tight and scantily covered with hair, the expression\r\nof the eye indicates extreme sensibility, the hair on the body becomes\r\nthin and short, and the skin as thin as paper; the _points_ continue\r\ngood, and predisposition to fatness increases, but the whole carcass\r\nbecomes much diminished in size, though retaining its plumpness, and\r\nbeautiful symmetry. The evil, however, does not terminate in the\r\nproduction of these symptoms. Internal diseases ensue, such as\r\ndisorganization of the liver, or rot, polypi in the trachea, clyers,\r\nmalformation of the bones of the neck and legs, and general\r\ndeformity.\" This position, however, will be strengthened by drawing\r\nattention to insulated portions of our race, where the effects of such\r\na system are exhibited on a considerable scale. The Members of the\r\nSociety of Friends were, at one time, supposed to be of all others the\r\nleast subject to insanity; but the very reverse is the case; being,\r\nfrom the limited nature of their sect, driven to frequent\r\nintermarriages, and to a consequent deterioration of the most active\r\npart of the human frame--the brain. It is for the same reason, that\r\nalmost every royal family contains a large proportion of idiots, or,\r\nat the best, persons of very weak intellect; and, such will continue\r\nto occur, till legislators fall on some plan of striking at the\r\ngroundwork of the mischief. If the laws of God and man define to us so\r\nclearly the evils of intermarrying with relatives; and if, as all\r\nanimals are constructed on one grand plan, we admit the proximity of\r\nthe sheep to the human race, it follows, that what is destructive, in\r\nthis respect, to the one, is destructive to the other; and that we\r\nshould seek, by a nearly similar, if not wider, range of rules, to\r\nobviate many of those diseases of which, when under our protection,\r\nthey are so frequently the subjects.\r\n\r\n(89.) _Breeding from different families of the same race._--Mr Culley,\r\nthough believing that no great harm can result from breeding\r\nin-and-in, yet appears to have in a manner preferred the preferable\r\npractice of breeding from different families of the same race; as he,\r\nfor many years, hired his rams from Mr Bakewell, at a time when other\r\nbreeders were paying a liberal price for his own valuable animals.\r\nThis is of all methods deservedly the best, as the males, which are\r\ninter-changed, have always had shades of difference impressed upon\r\nthem, by various soils and treatment, so that the defects of each\r\nfamily have a good chance to be counteracted by the perfections of the\r\nother. By this means the bad points are gradually exhausted, and their\r\nvaluable properties as gradually heightened. Breeders have been much\r\naided in the furtherance of this desirable plan, by the rearing of\r\nsuperior rams having become, of late years, a separate pursuit. The\r\nletting of them out to distant parts of the country has long been a\r\nbranch of this speculation; diffusing some of the most valuable points\r\nof particular breeds, and leading to a spirit of competition. The\r\npractice has been reprobated, but, I presume, rather hastily; for with\r\nall its attendant evils, such as leading to deception, by what is\r\ntermed the _making up_ of rams, it possesses excellencies which will,\r\nI hope, lead to its continuance.\r\n\r\n(90.) _Crossing._-The only other method of improving a breed is by\r\ncrossing two distinct races, one of which possesses the properties it\r\nis desirable to acquire, and wants the defects we wish to remove.\r\nThis, however, is a measure not to be recommended, and only to be\r\nresorted to when neither of the others will do; for it is scarcely\r\npossible to obtain the desirable properties without at the same time\r\nimparting qualities sufficient to neutralize them; and with which, in\r\nfact, we would rather dispense. To cross, as Mr Cleghorn remarks, any\r\nmountain breed with Leicester rams, with a view to obtain a propensity\r\nto fatten at an early age, would be attended with an enlargement of\r\nsize, which the mountain pasture could not support, and the progeny\r\nwould be a mongrel race, not suited to the pastures of either of the\r\nparent breeds. The folly of such a proceeding is beautifully shown in\r\nthe failure of the attempts made, some years ago, to better the fleece\r\nof the mountain sheep, in the South of Scotland. To effect this\r\ndesirable end, rams were brought from the Cheviot range of hills, and\r\nthe consequences were, as described by Mr William Hogg, of Stobbo, in\r\nthe _Quarterly Journal of Agriculture_, just what a preliminary\r\nconsideration of the existing circumstances would have proved to be\r\nunavoidable. \"The independent habits of the mountain flocks were lost,\r\nand a mongrel progeny, of a clumsy figure, occupied the lowest and\r\nwarmest of the pastures. As they were very improper subjects to breed\r\nfrom, they were often a drug in the market: _but the store-master had\r\nno other resource, but to struggle on against the opposition which the\r\nanimal itself made to the change_, and, also, against the influence of\r\nbad seasons, in order to get the influence of the Cheviot breed fully\r\nestablished. * * * With its shaggy coat the animal lost its bold\r\nindependent look, its stout shape, its unvitiated taste, and its sound\r\nconstitution. A course of severe winters too occurred during the time\r\nof changing, while every property calculated to resist privation and\r\nfatigue was unconfirmed in the progeny; and, in consequence, the\r\nravages by rot, and poverty, among the flocks that occupied soft\r\npastures were immense.\" How did it happen, that the store-master had\r\nno other resource but to persevere in an unprofitable course? Was he\r\nobliged to strive against natural obstacles, which even a short\r\nexperience might have taught him were, in that manner, insurmountable?\r\nWhy not recur _at once_ to the old mode of management, rather than\r\ninjure himself by kicking against the pricks. \"Sundry store-masters\r\nwere not aware,\" says Mr Hogg, \"that their old breed would so\r\nobstinately resist the impression of the Cheviot blood, nor did they\r\never dream that the mongrel issue would be so easily subdued by the\r\nhardships and cold of winter: thus finding their scheme opposed, at\r\npoints where they anticipated little resistance, they gave up the\r\nexperiment ere it was _half completed_, and introduced mountain rams\r\nto the mongrel issue.\" Enough, however, has been said to prove that\r\nthis plan ought not to be pursued: let me now say a few words as to\r\nthe reasons which should deter us from its adoption. To take a\r\nfamiliar illustration:--How would one of the worshipful company of\r\nAldermen, or a dignitary of the Church, manage to keep up an\r\n_appearance_, if suddenly transported from the luxurious plenty which\r\nsurrounds him, to the meagre fare, and churlish climate, of our\r\nHighlands? Would their offspring, which ten to one would be prone to\r\nrapid growth, and, therefore, requiring at the least a large supply of\r\nporridge and milk; would they, I ask, arrive at a healthy maturity, if\r\nsupported only on the oaten cake, and _whang_ of skimmed-milk cheese,\r\nof the hardy Northern? The answer is, they would not. They would,\r\ndoubtless, bear the climate; but the habit of body imprinted on them,\r\nby the full living of the parents, would require a more nutritious\r\nfood to bring it to the adult age, than what might be necessary for\r\nthe sustenance of any child descended from the possessors of the soil.\r\nIf such then is the case with the young of an animal shielded from\r\ninclemency on every hand, how can we expect the progeny of a rather\r\nheavy variety of a defenceless creature like the sheep to thrive, in\r\ndefiance of every thing ungenial, on a pasture which requires for its\r\ncollection, in any quantity, a degree of experience and activity, the\r\nresult of time and well-trained instinct. The mongrel is not unfitted\r\nfor the locality, as Mr Hogg would have it, by a weakness resulting\r\nfrom \"the constant and continued exertions of the two bloods, the one\r\nendeavouring to overpower the other,\" there is no war waging in the\r\nprogeny between the blood of sire and dam; the secret lies in the\r\nanimal being unsuited for the pasture where it is produced. Place it\r\nin a country possessing a herbage something between that of the\r\nHighland and Cheviot hills, and it will do passing well; but do not\r\nascribe the want of success to a natural hatred of the breeds. Again,\r\ndo not fall into the error, that \"the figure, wool, and other\r\nqualities, of the Cheviot ram, are most conspicuous (in this cross) in\r\nthe smallest and feeblest of the progeny, while the properties of the\r\nmountain breed are more fully exhibited in the strongest and most\r\nrobust lambs,\" a circumstance which, unfortunately, induced many of\r\nthe store-farmers \"to throw aside the best of the lambs, and select\r\nthose to breed from, which had apparently most of the Cheviot figure;\"\r\nor, in other words, do not suppose, as Mr Hogg strangely enough\r\ninfers, that only the weak animals took on the Cheviot form, and only\r\nthe strong ones assumed the Highland character. The correct\r\nexplanation is, that such as had most Cheviot blood were sure to\r\nbecome puny, from being unadapted to a herbage on which those that\r\nresembled the mountain stock throve tolerably well. Strength and\r\nfeebleness were, in this instance, mere secondary matters.\r\n\r\n(91.) _Things to be attended to in Crossing._--The fact is, that, if\r\nyou wish to have a _particular kind_ of sheep, you must first of all\r\nbe in possession of a pasture suitable for the new comers. You must\r\nconsider the influence of the individual parents on the progeny, the\r\nsize of the animals, their habits and dispositions, and their\r\npeculiarities in regard to the time of their maturity, and fattening\r\nproperties; and, having anticipated these apparently trifling affairs,\r\nyou must see that the surface of your farm, its degree of exposure,\r\nand the quantity and quality of its productions, are calculated for\r\nthe profitable maintenance of the animal in view. Far too little\r\nattention is bestowed, at the commencement of such an undertaking, on\r\nthese all-swaying matters. Farmers enter upon this, the most arduous\r\nof all professions, with the settled conviction, that nothing is so\r\nsimple as the engrafting of a race of animals on a particular part of\r\na country. They have read, or heard, of others who have gained fame,\r\nand a fortune, by successful endeavours of the kind, and they think\r\nthat nothing is easier than to follow their example; but they forget\r\nthe thoughtful hours, and irksome duties, these men had to tolerate,\r\nbefore they could speak of any thing like success. No animal can be\r\nmade to forego at once a long used food, an ancient locality,\r\npeculiarity of clime and season, and the instinctive habits that have\r\nbeen long nurtured by these, without both it and its progeny suffering\r\nfrom the change:--Nature cannot thus be made to bend to human\r\nintention; it will give way in the attempt.\r\n\r\nIn crossing there are several important things to be attended to. Well\r\nformed parents ought to be selected, and, if enlargement of the\r\ncarcass be wanted, the issue should be better fed than its\r\noriginators, which ought to be of a size rather under, than above what\r\nthe pasture is capable of supporting. The size of the parents should\r\nnot be much disproportioned at first, as nature abhors sudden\r\nextremes, and does every thing in the most gradual manner. It is\r\nbetter, when some increase has been attained, to bring the breed to\r\nthe required size by one or two crossings.[15] In choosing a breed, we\r\nshould adopt that which affords the greatest quantity of market\r\nproduce, in return for the food consumed;[16] and a particular breed\r\nought always to be preferred to the sheep of a district. We must not\r\nimagine, that when, by dint of crossing, we have obtained the variety\r\nwanted, that it will remain in the condition to which we have brought\r\nit, without the slightest liability to alter. Many farmers believe\r\nthey have done all that is required, if they subject their stock to\r\nthree or four crossings with a breed of acknowledged excellence. They\r\nthink that the improved animals they have obtained will support their\r\nacquired characters, uninfluenced by extraneous agency. Now nothing\r\ncan be more faulty than this mode of management, as is proved by a\r\ncomparison of stock so treated, with flocks which have uninterruptedly\r\nreceived that undeviating attention, which can alone ensure a\r\ncontinuance of the properties desired. Such men forget, that the\r\nclimate is operating with as great certainty on the animals as on the\r\nrocks around; and that as the herbage is determined by the nature of\r\nthe adjacent rocks, so are the peculiarities of the sheep influenced\r\nby the herbage; and that if they manage to change the characters of\r\nthe breed, it can, in a majority of cases, be only for a time, unless\r\nthe tendencies of the surrounding elements are counteracted, by a\r\nconstant recurrence to the originators of the flock. \"I am sorry,\"\r\nsays Little, in his valuable practical observations, \"to say, that\r\nthere are too many examples of those, who thought themselves at the\r\nhead of improvement in stock, relaxing their exertions, and keeping by\r\ntheir own stock; and the consequence has been, that such stocks have\r\ndegenerated, become delicate, tender, and diminutive in size; and from\r\nno other cause but that the same pains have not been taken to preserve\r\nthe improvement, that was taken to effect it. I could mention many\r\nimprovers who were of the first class formerly, but who are now only\r\nin the second.\" Changes, in fact, by crossing are not to be effected\r\nin a short space of time; you must look forward to several years of\r\nconstant exertion, before you can hope, in this manner, to alter your\r\nstock.[17] Then, again, we must be aware of the tendency which nature,\r\nin numerous instances, displays to perpetuate diseases, dispositions,\r\nand aberrations from the normal structure. Many qualities and\r\ndiseases, are known, in man, to be hereditary; of the former, I may\r\ninstance peculiarities in walking, and writing; a passion for\r\nintoxicating liquors, and other habits too trivial to mention; and of\r\nthe latter, gout, pulmonary consumption, and blindness from cataract,\r\nwhich are well known to harass a family for generations. Features, in\r\nlike manner, may remain for ages of the same undeviating cast; thus\r\nthe Jews of to-day are the very counterparts of the Jews of three\r\nthousand years back, and, in all likelihood, will so remain till the\r\nend of time. A predisposition to many diseases is engendered in the\r\nsheep, by too great a refinement in breeding, which tends to diminish\r\nthe size of the animal, prevents them feeding to perfection, destroys\r\ntheir fecundity, and imparts great tenderness of constitution.\r\nAccidental deviations from the natural type may, also, be hereditary,\r\nas is seen in those races of dogs which have a supernumerary toe on\r\nthe hind foot, and tarsal bones to correspond. In the human race also\r\nseveral generations of a particular family have been distinguished, by\r\nhaving six fingers and six toes, on their hands and feet. It is in\r\nlike manner to an accidental malformation, that the Americans are\r\nindebted for their Otter breed of sheep. Mr Livingston, who wrote in\r\n1811, thus describes them: \"The Otter sheep were first discovered on\r\nsome island, on the eastern coast, and have spread to the adjoining\r\nstates. The sheep are long-bodied rather than large, and weigh about\r\n15 lbs. a quarter. Their wool is of a medium fineness, and a medium\r\nlength; but that which particularly characterizes these sheep is the\r\nlength of their bodies, and the shortness of their legs, which are,\r\nalso, turned out in such a manner as to appear rickety. They cannot\r\nrun, or jump, and they even walk with some difficulty. They appear as\r\nif their legs had been broken and set by some awkward surgeon. They\r\ncan scarcely exist in a deep country, and they cannot possibly be\r\ndriven to a distant pasture or market.\" Dr Dwight, in his travels in\r\nNew England, remarks of this curious variety, that the fore legs are\r\nremarkably short, and bent inward, \"so as distinctly to resemble what\r\nare called club-feet.\"[18] I believe this to be the only instance\r\nwhere man has availed himself of a defect in the animal kingdom, and\r\nturned it to his advantage. Attention ought also to be bestowed on the\r\norder in which different parts of the animal are subjected to changes\r\nduring crossing. These, according to Dr Sturm, the latest observer on\r\nthis head, are first exhibited in those parts that possess a power of\r\nbeing reproduced, as the hair, horns, and hoofs. The fleshy parts\r\nchange slowly, in proportion as the mother has much of the blood of\r\nthe original race. The first changes take place in the head, and are\r\ngradually developed towards the hind quarters. Lastly, look to the\r\ncondition in which your sheep are as regards fatness. If fat, they\r\nwill be averse to becoming pregnant, and considerable annoyance will,\r\nin all likelihood, be experienced. A moderately low diet is most\r\nsuitable for ewes, for some time before the ram is admitted, in the\r\nsame way that fruit trees, when unproductive in a rich soil, are\r\nrendered fertile by placing straw and stones between their roots and\r\nthe too nutritious earth. A rather poor diet, also, during pregnancy,\r\nwill be found to obviate many of those risks which are sure to be\r\nincurred from repletion during this period.\r\n\r\n        [15] Dr Cline, in a communication to the Board of Agriculture,\r\n        observes on this point: \"Experience has proved, that crossing\r\n        has only succeeded in an eminent degree, in those instances in\r\n        which the females were larger, than in the usual proportion of\r\n        females to males, and that it has generally failed when the\r\n        males were proportionally large.\"\r\n\r\n        [16] It was owing to a peculiar view taken of this maxim, that\r\n        so enormous sums were asked and given, for the hire of rams,\r\n        at the time Mr Bakewell brought the new Leicester to\r\n        perfection. That gentleman would never have obtained 1200\r\n        guineas for the hire of three rams if the speculators had not\r\n        intended to procure nearly similar prices for the use of the\r\n        offspring of these animals; and it may be pretty safely\r\n        affirmed, that this traffic was ultimately the cause of much\r\n        mischief to the breed in question, by inducing many to\r\n        speculate on what was likely to prove a fashionable article,\r\n        without caring much for the endurance of the really valuable\r\n        points.\r\n\r\n        [17] Dr Sturm, professor of Agriculture, at Bonn, says, that a\r\n        new race may be produced in the same number of years as are\r\n        required for perfecting the teeth.\r\n\r\n        [18] Sheep are as liable to distortions of the skeleton as\r\n        other animals. The Museum of Guy's Hospital contains a very\r\n        good specimen of distorted spine taken from a sheep.\r\n\r\n(92.) _Choice of Parents._--However faulty sheep may be, some are\r\nalways to be found surpassing their fellows, and these it ought to be\r\nthe aim of every breeder to discover. Without acknowledge of an\r\nanimal's _points_, it is in vain that the breeder can hope for\r\nimprovement. He may by accident make a lucky hit, but, unless he has\r\nstudied his business from the bottom, he cannot follow up and avail\r\nhimself of an advantage, which a more knowing individual would, from\r\nprevious training, turn at once to a profitable account. Much may be\r\ndone by letter-press description; and this I shall endeavour to\r\nachieve; but more will be accomplished by a close and attentive\r\nexamination of a few well-selected animals, which it is now no\r\ndifficult matter to get a view of, as, thanks to the spirited\r\nexertions of the Highland Society, valuable specimens are far from\r\nrare. In breeding and rearing rams, two divisions of these animals are\r\nrecognised,--ram getters, and wedder getters,--the former, from their\r\nfineness, being kept for the procreation of animals like themselves,\r\nwhile the latter, from their coarseness, are set aside as fitted only\r\nfor parent stock for grazier's sheep, the mere grazier liking a ram no\r\nworse for having a massy frame, and being less scrupulous about his\r\nform than the ram breeder, whose grand object is fineness, and who\r\ntrusts to the ewes for giving the offspring size and substance. The\r\nprincipal ram-breeders are guided in the choice of their ram-lambs,\r\nmore by blood or parentage, than by form, on which, at so early an\r\nage, little dependance can be placed. In the case of the Dishleys,\r\nthey allow them every indulgence, from the time of weaning till that\r\nof shearing, as they push them forward with the intent of letting them\r\nthe first season, while yet yearlings. It is this early arrival at\r\nmaturity, which is, with truth, supposed by some to occasion their\r\nearly falling off; for by a law of the animal economy, premature adult\r\nage is always succeeded by premature decay; life appearing to be dated\r\nfrom the time the animal enters on the fulfilment of the ends for\r\nwhich it was created.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr Bakewell, the shape which should be the criterion of a\r\nsheep, is that of a hogshead or firkin, truly circular, with small and\r\nas short legs as possible: upon the plain principle, that the value\r\nlies in the barrel, not in the legs; and all breeds the backs of which\r\nrise in the least ridge are bad. Their bodies should be as true\r\nbarrels as can be seen, their backs round and broad, and their legs\r\nnot much exeeeding six inches in length. The following is a\r\nmeasurement of a three-years' old ram of Mr Bakewell,\r\n\r\n                          Feet.  Inches.\r\n\r\n  Girth,                    5     10\r\n  Height,                   2      5\r\n  Breadth of Collar,        1      4\r\n  Breadth of shoulders,     1     11-1/2\r\n  Breadth across the ribs,  1     10-1/2\r\n  Breadth across the hips,  1      9-1/2\r\n\r\nA most unusual proof of kindly feeding in the animals of this shape,\r\nis their feeling quite fat, just within their fore legs, on the rib; a\r\npoint in which sheep are seldom examined, from common breeds never\r\ncarrying fat there. They are particularly distinguished by the\r\nlightness of the offal, the bones being one-half smaller than in some\r\nother breeds, and the meat proportionally thicker, while the pelt is\r\nthin, and the head small--a thing of some consequence in most parts of\r\nEngland, where that Scottish luxury, sheep-head broth, is so cordially\r\ndespised.\r\n\r\nThe best form for a cheviot ram is thus described by Mr Cully, in his\r\nexcellent work on _Live-Stock_: \"His head should be fine and small;\r\nhis nostrils wide and expanded; his eyes prominent, and rather bold or\r\ndaring; ears thin; his collar full from his breast and shoulders, but\r\ntapering gradually all the way to where the neck and head join, which\r\nshould be very fine and graceful, being perfectly free from any coarse\r\nleather hanging down; the shoulders broad and full, which must at the\r\nsame time join so easy to the collar forward and chine backward, as to\r\nleave not the least hollow in either place; the mutton upon his arm or\r\nfore-thigh must come quite to the knee; his legs upright, with a clean\r\nfine bone, being equally clear from superfluous skin and coarse hairy\r\nwool from the knee and hough downwards; the breast broad and well\r\nforward, which will keep his forelegs at a proper wideness; his girth\r\nor chest full and deep, and instead of a hollow behind the shoulders,\r\nthat part by some called the fore-flank, should be quite full; the\r\nback and loins broad, flat, and straight, from which the ribs must\r\nrise in a fine circular arch; his belly straight; the quarters long\r\nand full, with the mutton quite down to the hough, which should\r\nneither stand in nor out; his twist deep, wide and full, which, with\r\nthe broad breast, will keep his four legs open and upright; the whole\r\nbody covered with a thin pelt, and that with bright soft wool. The\r\nnearer any breed comes up to the above description, the nearer they\r\napproach towards excellence of form.\" As an amusing contrast to this\r\nwell drawn picture, I give an extract from the work of that ancient\r\nagriculturist Columella.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, the way to judge and approve of a ram, is not only that of\r\nobserving if he is clothed with a white fleece, but also if his palate\r\nand tongue are of the same colour with his wool; for when these parts\r\nof his body are black or spotted, there arises a black or speckled\r\noffspring. And this, among other things, the same poet I mentioned\r\nabove, (Virgil, Georg. Lib. iii.) has excellently pointed out in such\r\nnumbers as these:\"\r\n\r\n    \"Reject him, tho' the ram himself be white,\r\n    Under whose ousy palate lies concealed\r\n    A black or spotted tongue; for with black spots\r\n    He'll stain the fleeces of his future race.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some amusing remarks on the same subject, delivered in a very\r\nquaint way, he concludes his description with the mention of \"twisted\r\nhorns,\"--\"not because this last is more useful, (for a ram without\r\nhorns is better,) but because horns that are twisted and bended\r\ninwards are not at all so hurtful as those that are set upright and\r\nexpanded. Nevertheless, in some countries where the climate is wet and\r\nwindy, we would wish for he-goats and rams even with the very largest\r\nhorns; because, when they are high and extended, they defend the\r\ngreatest part of the head from the storm.\"\r\n\r\nIt is thus that among some of his most beautiful remarks, we have\r\ngenerally a something occurring which upsets the gravity of the whole\r\nby its childish absurdity.\r\n\r\n(93.) _Influence of Sex._--In early ages, the greater share of\r\nattention appears to have been bestowed on _male_ domesticated\r\nanimals, on account of the more numerous offspring of which they would\r\nbecome the parents; and from this, as the Rev. Henry Berry, of Acton\r\nBeauchamp, Worcestershire, supposes, (in a valuable essay on the\r\nbreeding of live stock, published in the _British Farmer's Magazine_,)\r\nhas originated the prevalent idea, that the male has a more decided\r\ninfluence, than the female, on the form of the progeny. \"The ideas\r\nentertained respecting the useful qualities of an animal would (in\r\nformer times) be very similar, and lead to the adoption of a general\r\nstandard of excellence, towards which it would be required that each\r\nmale should approximate; and thus there would exist, among what may be\r\ntermed fashionable sires, a corresponding form and character,\r\ndifferent from, and superior to, those of the general stock of the\r\ncountry. This form and character would, in most instances, have been\r\nacquired by _perseverance in breeding from animals which possessed the\r\nimportant or fancied requisites_, and might, therefore, be said to be\r\nalmost _confirmed_ in such individuals. Under these circumstances,\r\nstriking results would doubtless follow the introduction of these\r\nsires to a common stock; results which would lead superficial\r\nobservers to remark, that individual sires possessed properties as\r\n_males_, which, in fact, were only assignable to them as _improved_\r\nanimals.\"\r\n\r\nIn general, the qualities of the male and female parents are visible\r\nto an equal extent in the offspring, as is well exemplified among\r\nhorses, in the mixture of the blood and cart breed, where the great\r\ndifference in form and character is nicely blended; but, occasionally,\r\nthe peculiarities of the male, or female, are visible only on some\r\nparticular part of the offspring, as in the crossing of the Merino ram\r\nwith the Ryeland ewe, when the former affects the fleece, and the\r\nlatter the carcass.\r\n\r\nThough there are many opinions as to the comparative influence of the\r\nsexes on the progeny, yet, as before stated, the majority of voices\r\nrepresent the male as the more influential. Mr Boswell, in his essay\r\non this subject, published in the _Quarterly Journal of Agriculture_,\r\nand in the _Farmer's Magazine_, is decidedly of this opinion, \"Being\r\nfully convinced of the power of the male on the offspring, I have\r\nalways accounted it as a loss to put a bad male to a high bred female,\r\nand have never done so. I have, however, observed, where the country\r\npeople have purchased high bred sheep at any sale of mine, and bred\r\nfrom them with the ordinary rams, that the breed very quickly got bad:\r\nwhereas, when a Bakewell ram had been purchased, I have seen a most\r\nremarkable change on the quality of the sheep; and, in several\r\ninstances, where the ewes (Highlanders) had been tolerable from which\r\nthey had bred, the cross was so nearly resembling a new Leicester, as\r\nto deceive any one who was not a thorough judge.\" Bewick, the natural\r\nhistorian, supports this opinion when speaking of the original breed\r\nof wild cattle, still to be found in a few English and Scottish parks.\r\nThey are uniformly pure white, with black or red ears and noses. He\r\nsays, that cows, when in season, used often to be turned into the park\r\nat Chillingham Castle, in Northumberland, and that, when covered by\r\nthe wild bull, _all their produce was uniformly white, with red ears\r\nand noses_. On the other hand, the female is, also, prevalently\r\nbelieved to have some share in the matter, and much may be adduced as\r\nevidence of its power over the form of the offspring, equally\r\nauthentic with the former. Mr Ferguson, in a paper on live-stock, in\r\nthe _Quarterly Journal of Agriculture_, relates the following apposite\r\nand amusing story:--\r\n\r\n\"Naturalists are, I believe, nearly agreed, that the influence of the\r\nmale exceeds that of the female in communicating qualities to the\r\noffspring, and a very providential arrangement it is, in respect that\r\ngood points may be thus diffused with far more rapidity than could\r\notherwise occur. The choice of the female is by no means, however, a\r\nmatter of indifference, and it is only by due attention to both that\r\nperfection can be looked for. I recollect several years ago, at a\r\ndistinguished breeder's in Northumberland, meeting with a shrewd\r\nScottish borderer, (indeed, if report be true, the original and\r\nidentical Dandy Dinmont,) who, after admiring, with a considerable\r\n_spice of national pique_, a very fine short-horn bull, demanded\r\nanxiously to see the dam. The cow having been accordingly produced,\r\nand having undergone a regular survey, Dandy vociferated, with\r\ncharacteristic _pith_, '_I think naething o' your bull now, wi' sic a\r\ncaumb_;' and, unquestionably, the mould or '_caumb_' must have its own\r\nshare in producing shapes, though in his haste to detract, (as he\r\nthought,) from the merits of the bull, poor Dandy totally overlooked\r\nthe additional compliment paid to the judgment of the '_Southron_.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is in general supposed, that if the female be by descent small,\r\nthat the length of the legs of the issue will not be influenced by the\r\nmale. The weight of the carcass is a good deal affected by the male,\r\nbut not so much as by the female. The impressions of one or other,\r\nespecially of the male, do not cease on the birth of the fruits of a\r\nconnection, for though he may have no further meeting with that\r\nfemale, yet are the succeeding offspring tinged with his peculiar\r\ncolour, or modelled after his form. This is well illustrated by a fact\r\nwhich came under the notice of the Earl of Morton. His lordship bred\r\nfrom a male quagga and a mare of seven-eights Arabian blood, a female\r\nhybrid, displaying in form and colour her mixed origin. The mare was\r\nthen given to Sir Gore Ouseley, who bred from her first a filly and\r\nafterwards a colt, by a fine black Arabian horse, but both these, in\r\ntheir colour and in the hair of their manes, strongly resembled the\r\nquagga. This isolated fact would be, however, but of small value if\r\nunsupported by others, which are luckily now of common occurrence,\r\namong which the following tends strongly to its corroboration:--In the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_ for 1821, Dr Wollaston relates that D.\r\nGiles, Esq., had a sow of the black and white kind, which, after\r\nlittering by a chestnut boar of the wild breed, was put, some time\r\nafter the death of this, to boars of quite a different variety, yet\r\nthe offspring were covered with chestnut marks, so as closely to\r\nresemble the long-departed animal.\r\n\r\nThe progeny of most domesticated animals often bear a striking\r\nresemblance to the grandmother or grandfather, and it is well known\r\nthat the desired changes cannot be effected on a breed, or that the\r\ndesired breed cannot be produced, till the third, fourth, or even the\r\nfifth crossing, so that the importance of having few defects in a\r\nstock will be readily admitted, seeing their debasing consequences are\r\ncarried through whole generations, and that though absent in one\r\nremove, yet that they may appear in the next. Both sire and dam should\r\nbe chosen as free from defects as possible, a thing often neglected in\r\nrearing domestic animals, especially horses, where the opinion is in\r\nvogue, that no matter how debilitated and worn out may be the dam, yet\r\nthat if coupled with a young and perfect sire, a healthy handsome\r\noffspring will be the issue; than which idea nothing can be more\r\nabsurd, as such animals, if left to nature, would seldom or never come\r\nin contact, owing to the one party never attaining a decrepit age, but\r\nperishing on its verge.\r\n\r\n(94.) _The sex of the progeny is supposed to be the result of the\r\nrelative ages of the parents_; thus, issue from a young male and an\r\nold female will in general be feminine, while that from an old male\r\nand a young female will generally be masculine; and it has been\r\nproposed to turn this, apparently a law of nature, to account, in the\r\nmanagement of flocks, as it must often be of consequence to obtain, at\r\nwill, a considerable increase of the sex most wanted. On this subject\r\nthere will be found an interesting paper in the first number of the\r\n_Quarterly Journal of Agriculture_, entitled, \"A method of obtaining a\r\ngreater number of One Sex at the option of the Proprietor, in the\r\nBreeding of Live-Stock,\" and from this I extract the following:--\r\n\r\n\"In the _Annales de l'Agriculture Francaise_, Vols. xxxvii. and\r\nxxxviii., some very interesting experiments are recorded, which have\r\nlately been made in France, on the breeding of live-stock. M. Charles\r\nGirou de Buzareingues proposed, at a meeting of the Agricultural\r\nSociety of Severac, on the 3d of July, 1826, to divide a flock of\r\nsheep into two equal parts, so that a greater number of males or\r\nfemales, at the choice of the proprietor, should be produced from each\r\nof them. Two of the members of the society offered their flocks to\r\nbecome the subjects of his experiments, and the results have now been\r\ncommunicated, which are in accordance with the author's expectations.\r\n\r\n\"The first experiment was conducted in the following manner:--He\r\nrecommended very young rams to be put to the flock of ewes from which\r\nthe proprietor wished the greater number of females in their offspring\r\nand also, that during the season when the rams were with the ewes,\r\nthey should have more abundant pasture than the other; while to the\r\nflock from which the proprietor wished to obtain male lambs chiefly,\r\nhe recommended him to put strong and vigorous rams, four or five years\r\nold. The following tabular view contains the result of his\r\nexperiment:--\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+\r\n  |     Flock for female lambs.      |      Flock for male lambs.       |\r\n  +---------------------+------------+----------------------+-----------+\r\n  | Age of the mothers. |Sex of the  |  Age of the mothers. |Sex of the |\r\n  |                     |   Lambs.   |                      |   Lambs.  |\r\n  |---------------------+------+-----+----------------------+------+----+\r\n  |                     |Males.| Fem.|                      |Males.|Fem.|\r\n  |Two years,           |  14  |  26 |Two years,            |  7   |  3 |\r\n  |Three years,         |  16  |  29 |Three years,          |  15  | 14 |\r\n  |Four years,          |   5  |  21 |Four years,           |  33  | 14 |\r\n  |                     |  --  |  -- |                      |  --  | -- |\r\n  |    Total,           |  35  |  76 |    Total,            |  55  | 31 |\r\n  |Five years and older,|  18  |   8 |Five years and older, |  25  | 24 |\r\n  |                     |  --  |  -- |                      |  --  | -- |\r\n  |    Total,           |  53  |  84 |    Total,            |  80  | 55 |\r\n  |                                  |                                  |\r\n  |N.B.--There were three twin-births|N.B.--There were no twin-births   |\r\n  |in this flock.

Or, in other words, when a race of animals\r\nis in circumstances favourable for its increase, Nature produces the\r\ngreatest number of that sex which, in animals that do not pair, is\r\nmost efficient for increasing the number of the race. But if they are\r\nin a bad climate, or on a stinted pasture, or if they have already\r\ngiven birth to a numerous offspring, then Nature, setting limits to\r\nthe increase of the race, produces more males than females. Yet,\r\nperhaps, it may be premature to attempt to deduce any law from\r\nexperiments which have not yet been sufficiently extended. M. Girou\r\nis disposed to ascribe much of the effect to the age of the ram,\r\nindependent of the condition of the ewe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF SHEEP.\r\n\r\n\r\n(95.) Those who have attended to the subject are well aware, that the\r\nprofitable management of livestock is the most difficult department in\r\nthe business of a farm. So much depends on the nature of the locality\r\nwhere sheep are kept, and on its situation in regard to markets for\r\nthe disposal of its produce, that little but what is of general\r\napplication need be written on this head. Precise rules for\r\nagricultural conduct can seldom be laid down with any probability of\r\ntheir being followed, as it must necessarily vary less or more with\r\nthe peculiar circumstances of the estate, and must, therefore, to a\r\ngreat extent, be trusted to the intelligence of the farmer. All,\r\ntherefore, that I shall aim at in treating of this division, will be\r\nthe giving an outline of the more important matters connected with\r\nsheep-husbandry, leaving the tyro to use it as circumstances may point\r\nout. For obvious reasons, a natural arrangement of the subject is the\r\nbest; and to this, therefore, I shall, as much as possible, adhere.\r\n\r\n(96.) _Putting Tups to Ewes._ The middle of November is the time at\r\nwhich this is usually done, but the season is anticipated or delayed\r\naccording as the spring provender is expected to be early or late,\r\nplentiful or scarce. When the sheep are spread over a wide track, one\r\nram is in general allotted to thirty ewes; but when the latter are on a\r\nlimited range of pasture, the proportion of one to fifty may be\r\nreckoned ample. The rams ought not to be left with the ewes above four\r\nor five weeks, as it does not do to have lambs dropped after the middle\r\nof May; indeed much trouble will be saved to the shepherd if he can\r\ncontrive to have all the lambs yeaned about the same time, as the flock\r\nwill, from its numbers being of a similar standing, be healthier, and\r\nevery way easier to manage, than one in which there is a great\r\ndiversity of ages. Such ewes, therefore, as have not evinced an\r\ninclination for the male, ought, before the above period has elapsed,\r\nto be driven into a barn or small inclosure, and made to run about\r\ntill they have become a little heated, after which, when the ram\r\nis introduced, the desired effect will doubtless follow. Delay will\r\nin many cases be unavoidable, owing to the ewes being in too\r\nhigh condition; but this the shepherd should try to obviate, by\r\nadministering one or two doses of Epsom salts, which, by reducing the\r\nplethora, will increase the activity of the animal, and render it in\r\nmany ways more prone to pregnancy.\r\n\r\nAs it is an object of some importance to retard the yeaning of gimmer\r\nhogs till the spring be well advanced, the rams are never sent to them\r\ntill a fortnight after they have been put to the older ewes. Much\r\nnicety is always required in choosing the time at which rams mould be\r\nput to gimmers, as they are in general sorry nurses, and sure, in bad\r\nseasons, to lose many lambs.\r\n\r\nWhen a farm is provided with suitable enclosures, careful selection of\r\nboth ewes and rams should always be attended to, taking care to make\r\nthe good points of the one remedy the defects of the other; but where\r\na farm is destitute of such accommodation, the next best plan is to\r\nsend the finest rams to the ewes for a few days before the rest of the\r\nmales are admitted.\r\n\r\nGreat ewes ought always to be well looked after. The driest and best\r\nsheltered fields should be set apart for them, and turnips, when\r\nforming part of their food, should, when they are about to yean,\r\nalways be carted to their pasture. When they roll _awald_, and cannot\r\nregain their feet, prompt assistance should be afforded them, else\r\nthey will soon die. Death in this case occurs from suffocation, though\r\nthe morbid appearances exhibited by the carcass are frequently\r\nmistaken for those of braxy. Udder locking ought never to be\r\nattempted, as it often leads to abortion, and is, besides, not of the\r\nslightest utility.\r\n\r\n(97.) _Early Lambs._ Though in the greater number of our breeds the\r\narrival of the rutting season is fixed and regular, yet there are\r\nseveral in which pregnancy may, by proper management, be induced at\r\nany period. Of these the Dorsetshire and Wicklow varieties are the\r\nmost noted, and are on this account selected for the rearing of\r\nhouse-lambs in the vicinity of towns, the inhabitants of which are\r\nopulent enough to create a demand for so expensive an article.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of June is the time chosen for the admission of the\r\nrams, so that by the month of January the greater proportion of the\r\newes have yeaned. According to the plan pursued in Middlesex, \"The\r\nsheep, which begin to lamb about Michaelmas, are kept in the close\r\nduring the day, and in the house during the night, until they have\r\nproduced twenty or thirty lambs. These lambs are then put into a\r\nlamb-house, which is kept constantly well littered with clean wheat\r\nstraw; and chalk, both in lump and in powder, is provided for them to\r\nlick, in order to prevent looseness, and thereby preserve the lambs in\r\nhealth. As a prevention against gnawing the boards, or eating each\r\nother's wool, a little wheat straw is placed, with the ears downwards,\r\nin a rack within their reach, with which they amuse themselves, and of\r\nwhich they eat a small quantity. In this house they are kept with\r\ngreat care and attention until fit for the butcher.\r\n\r\n\"The mothers of the lambs are turned, every night at eight o'clock,\r\ninto the lamb-house to their offspring. At six o'clock in the morning\r\nthese mothers are separated from their lambs, and turned into the\r\npastures; and, at eight o'clock, such ewes as have lost their own\r\nlambs, and those ewes whose lambs are sold, are brought in and held by\r\nthe head till the lambs by turns suck them clean: they are then turned\r\ninto the pasture; and at twelve o'clock, the mothers of the lambs are\r\ndriven from the pasture into the lamb-house for an hour, in the course\r\nof which time each lamb is suckled by its mother. At four o'clock, all\r\nthe ewes that have not lambs of their own are again brought to the\r\nlamb-house, and held for the lambs to suck; and at eight, the mothers\r\nof the lambs are brought to them for the night.\r\n\r\n\"This method of suckling is continued all the year. The breeders\r\nselect such of the lambs as become fat enough, and of proper age\r\n(about eight weeks old) for slaughter, and send them to the market\r\nduring December and three or four succeeding months, at prices which\r\nvary from one guinea to four, and the rest of the year at about two\r\nguineas each. This is severe work for the ewes, and some of them die\r\nfrom exhaustion. However, care is taken that they have plenty of food;\r\nfor when green food (viz. turnips, cole, rye, tares, clover, &c.)\r\nbegins to fail, brewers' grains are given them in troughs, and\r\nsecond-crop hay in racks, as well to support the ewes as to supply the\r\nlambs with plenty of milk; for if that should not be abundant, the\r\nlambs would become stunted, in which case no food would fatten them.\r\n\r\n\"A lamb-house to suckle from one hundred and sixty to one hundred and\r\neighty lambs at a time, should be seventy feet long and eighteen feet\r\nbroad, with three coops of different sizes at each end, and so\r\nconstructed as to divide the lambs according to their ages.\"[19]\r\n\r\n        [19] Middlesex Report, p. 355.\r\n\r\nIn the county of Wicklow it is the practice to divide the twenty-four\r\nhours by four equal periods, and to feed the lambs with ewe's milk and\r\ncow's milk alternately. When commencing with cow's milk, a quarter of a\r\npint is given, twice a-day, to each lamb, and this is gradually\r\nincreased to a pint, exclusive of the milk from the ewe. This method of\r\nfeeding has been cavilled at, but I think unjustly, as the ewe is thus\r\nsaved from the bad effects of exhaustion, and the lambs are fit for the\r\nbutcher when six weeks old, or sooner.\r\n\r\n(98.) _Lambing time._ When the ewes begin to drop their lambs, a time\r\nwhich ordinarily happens in the first or second week of April, but\r\nwhich, in other modes of management, must be dated twenty-two weeks\r\nafter the tupping season, the shepherd has many calls upon his skill\r\nand watchfulness. In bad seasons, sheep are apt to prove unkind to\r\ntheir offspring, and none more so than the Cheviots. In this event, the\r\nbest pastures should be selected for them, or turnips may be carted to\r\nthem; but as gimmer hogs are often quite incapable of furnishing the\r\nnecessary quantity of milk, the shepherd ought always to be provided\r\nwith a bottle of milk, which he should drop from his own mouth into\r\nthat of any lambs which may require it. Such mothers as appear to\r\nsuffer in bringing forth, should be relieved with the utmost\r\ngentleness; and when a miscarriage occurs, if the weather be at the\r\nsame time unfavourable, the dam ought to receive the shelter of a roof.\r\nWhen the ewe is lost in yeaning, her lamb, if it survive her, must be\r\nreared by another dam. Some little artifice is always necessary to\r\ninduce a ewe to adopt the offspring of another. Covering the lamb with\r\nthe skin of her own dead one, is sometimes resorted to, but this is\r\nhardly required, as any dam will take to another's offspring if the\r\nparties be shut up for some time together. Ewes that are late in\r\nlambing should be collected together, so as to be more under the care\r\nof the shepherd, and ought to be well fed, for the sake of bringing\r\nforward their lambs. Those lambs which are very far behind the rest\r\nmust be prepared for the butcher, as they would make but a poor figure\r\nat the Lammas sales.\r\n\r\n(99.) _Washing._ The time for clipping varies much, being earlier in\r\nseasons which have been preceded by favourable weather and an unstinted\r\nallowance of food, than in such as have followed a rigorous winter,\r\ndisease, or any other cause calculated to arrest the growth of wool.\r\nThe season may be said to be limited by the middle of May and the\r\nmiddle of July; but this should not be taken as a rule of conduct, the\r\nbest guide being the state of the new coat, which ought always to be\r\nwell above the skin before shearing is attempted. The wool, unless\r\namong some mountain flocks, is always, in this country, washed prior to\r\nits removal from the sheep's back; but in Spain that operation is\r\nalways deferred till the fleeces have been collected, when they are\r\nsubjected to a thorough scouring, in public buildings appropriated to\r\nthe purpose, and termed _lavatories_. This is a plan in many respects\r\nsuperior to ours. Its adoption by our farmers has been recommended by\r\nDr Parry. There cannot be a doubt of its being the preferable mode as\r\nregards the saving it would effect in the lives of sheep; but as it is\r\nwell known that shearing is much facilitated by washing, and that on\r\nthe neatness with which the clipping is accomplished the quality of the\r\nsucceeding crop in a great measure depends, some little time will be\r\nnecessary to determine the comparative value of either mode. In New\r\nSouth Wales it is customary to make the sheep swim across a stream for\r\ntwo or three mornings before being washed, by which means the yolk is\r\nsoftened, and the removal of grease and dirt much promoted; but this,\r\nthough a good plan in that mild and even climate, could not be looked\r\nupon as safe in a temperature so variable as that of Britain. In cases\r\nhowever, where great nicety is required, the plan in vogue in the\r\nformer country, that of dipping each sheep, before washing, into a\r\ncaldron of warm water, might be beneficially adopted.\r\n\r\nMountain sheep are cleaned by being forced to swim across a pool, but\r\nthe finer or lowland breeds are washed entirely by the hand. The latter\r\nmethod alone demands a short explanation. Dry, and, if possible, sunny\r\nweather, is selected for the operation, on the morning of which the\r\nlambs are separated from the flock, and the latter is conveyed to the\r\nmargin of some pebbly-bottomed pool. Here they are penned or otherwise\r\nkept together, while they are seized, one by one, by a man standing\r\nmid-thigh deep near the water-edge, and turned back downwards, the head\r\nalone being above the surface. Plate V. fig. 1.[20] It is then turned\r\nfrom side to side, and moved backwards and forwards, so as to make the\r\nwool catch upon the stream and wave about. When the first washer has\r\nheld it for a few minutes, and partially cleansed the fleece, he passes\r\nit _up the river_ to the next, who goes through the same routine, and,\r\non being convinced that the skin is free from filth, compels the sheep\r\nto land by swimming in an oblique direction up the water. Three and\r\neven four men are sometimes employed in washing sheep, but two, as here\r\ndescribed, will, under ordinary circumstances, be found sufficient. The\r\nbank on which the dripping sheep are collected, should have a clean and\r\nfirm turf, and the flock should, till fairly dry and fit for shearing,\r\nbe kept on heavy grass land, or, what is better, in straw-bedded folds.\r\n\r\n        [20] For the figures 1, 2 and 3 in Plate V. I am indebted to\r\n        the _Quarterly Journal of Agriculture_ for 1832, p. 869.\r\n\r\n(100.) _Shearing._ After allowing eight days, off or on, to elapse from\r\nthe time of washing, so as to permit the wool to gain a fresh supply\r\nof yolk, and along with it lustre and elasticity, the sheep may be\r\nstripped of its fleece. As there is no saving in employing an unskilful\r\nclipper, every encouragement should be given to induce servants to cut\r\nclose, smoothly and evenly, and to avoid injuring the skin, or going\r\ntwice over the same part. There are two ways in this country of\r\ndepriving sheep of their wool. In the first, or coarser method, which\r\nis only adopted in the case of Cheviot and heath sheep, the operator\r\nsits upon the ground, and placing the animal on its back between his\r\nknees, shears the wool first from the belly and legs, and then, after\r\ntying the latter, proceeds to clear the back. In the second method, the\r\nlegs are never tied, as the disposition of the sheep is such as to\r\nrender it unnecessary. The animal is placed as in Fig. 2, Plate V., and\r\nthe shearer clips first one side, cutting from the middle of the belly\r\nto that of the back, down to the loins. It is then placed on its side,\r\nas in Fig, 3, Plate V., the knee of the operator pressing on its neck,\r\nand the wool is removed from the legs and buttocks. The fleece is next\r\nrolled up, with the cut side outwards, commencing at the tail, and\r\nusing the wool of the other extremity as a fastening for the bundle.\r\n\r\nA cool dry apartment should be selected in which to store the wool,\r\nalways remembering that _heat_ and _damp_ are equally injurious to it,\r\nand that the greater the perfection in which it retains its _natural\r\noily moisture_, the more valuable will it prove both to the grower and\r\nthe manufacturer.\r\n\r\n(101.) _Weaning_, where milking is not practised, ought to be set about\r\nin the end of July or beginning of August. In some places the ewe lambs\r\nare never speaned, but allowed to go at large with their mothers; and\r\nthough by this plan the dam is apt to be kept in poor condition, yet is\r\nthis counterbalanced by the comparative freedom of the hogs from braxy.\r\nAs an improvement, however, the gimmer lambs may be withheld for a\r\nfortnight from their mothers, and at the end of that time may be\r\npermitted to pasture with them. In the few places where the farmer\r\ncontinues to manufacture ewe-milk cheese and butter, speaning is\r\ncarried into effect somewhat earlier, and is of course attended, in the\r\nlong run, with no little detriment to the stock and its proprietor. The\r\nsooner that the practice be laid aside the better; for though ewe-milk\r\ncheese is pretty universally relished and admired, yet those who are\r\nacquainted with the scenes which happen at the bughts, know well that\r\nthe cheese itself cannot but contain much, the mere mention of which\r\nwould pall at once the appetite even of the least fastidious. In\r\naddition to this, a great waste of grass is occasioned by the sheep\r\ngoing to and from the bught, while the inconveniences they are on every\r\nhand exposed to, at a season when they are peculiarly liable to disease\r\nand accident, ought of themselves to lead to the abolition of the\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nWhen the udders of the ewes appear, after their separation from the\r\nlambs, to be much distended, they may be once or twice milked, to\r\nprevent bad consequences; but it is much better to obviate the\r\nnecessity for this, by reducing their allowance of food for a few days.\r\nWhen the animal seems to suffer much irritation about the udder, it\r\nwill always be safe to give a brisk dose of any of the common saline\r\npurgatives.\r\n\r\nThe store lambs are at this period sent to good pasture, or, where the\r\nfarm cannot afford it, are _summered_ at a distance; that is to say,\r\nthe farmer pays so much a head for permission to feed his flock, during\r\na couple of months, on another person's ground, at the end of which\r\nperiod they are turned upon the pasture which has just been vacated by\r\nthe gimmers, they having been sent to join the older ewes.\r\n\r\n(102.) _Smearing_, in those places where it is still carried on, is\r\nperformed in two ways, according to the quality of the wool.\r\n_Slipping_, as the one method is termed, is only employed in high, wet\r\ndistricts, where the sheep are covered with long wool; while _rolling_,\r\nas the other is usually called, is only required for such as, in dry\r\nsituations, are surrounded by a short close pile. In pursuing the\r\nformer plan, the smearer takes up the mixture on the forefinger of his\r\nright hand, and while holding the locks of wool apart with his arms and\r\nleft hand, allows the salve to drop into the groove or shed, along\r\nwhich it is spread by the other fingers.\r\n\r\nIn _rolling_, a small quantity only of smearing stuff is raised on the\r\n_point_ of the forefinger, with which it is laid evenly upon the skin.\r\nThis is by far the neater way of salving, as less of the ointment is\r\npermitted to get upon the wool; but as it is altogether a tardier\r\nprocess, it is not so frequently resorted to.\r\n\r\nNovember is the month usually chosen for this operation, but as it\r\ncannot be properly done unless the day fixed upon has been preceded by\r\ndry weather, the time ought rather to be selected by the aspect of the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe composition of smearing stuffs is so very various, that it is quite\r\nbeyond my power to give the reader even a list of the ordinary\r\ningredients and their proportions; nor need I recommend any of them in\r\nparticular to the attention of the shepherd, knowing, as I do, the\r\nbigoted opinions which are held upon the subject, and the aversion with\r\nwhich every one regards a mixture not of their own composing. I can\r\nonly observe, that where tar is employed, it ought to be well diluted\r\nwith grease, so as to enable two English quarts of it to be spread over\r\nsix sheep. In this way it will be less liable to adhere to the wool,\r\nand will be much more readily laid upon the skin. When sheep are salved\r\nwithout due attention to the even spreading of the mixture, the insects\r\nwith which the skin is infested are, instead of being destroyed,\r\nallowed here and there a resting place; and as the severity of their\r\nattack is in proportion to the limited nature of their range, the skin\r\nat these points soon becomes crusted with scabs. The smaller the\r\nquantity of tar employed, as consistent with the keeping down of\r\nvermin, so much the better, as the wool is of more value to the\r\nmanufacturer, the sheep is saved the discomfort of having its fleece\r\nplastered and matted, and the shepherd is spared the vexation of losing\r\nlambs through their inability to reach an udder surrounded by locks of\r\nhard and tangled wool.\r\n\r\n(103.) _Fatting._ The age at which sheep are prepared for the butcher\r\ndepends upon the breed, its situation, and its propensity to take on\r\nfat. The heath sheep may be considered as requiring to be the greatest\r\nlength of time in the hands of the farmer, and the Leicesters as the\r\nreverse; wethers of the former variety being usually disposed off when\r\nfrom three to four years old, and ewes when from four to five; while\r\nwethers of the latter kind are fit for market often at eighteen months,\r\nand the ewes are in general fed off after the third year.\r\n\r\nSheep, in spring and autumn, are peculiarly liable to diseases of the\r\nintestines, a circumstance mainly to be ascribed to the changes which\r\nare, in these seasons, constantly occurring in the nature of their\r\nfood. Much of this is owing to careless management in the economy of\r\nthe pastures, and to restricting them for great lengths of time to one\r\nkind of provender, a thing guarded against by all good breeders. Sudden\r\ntransitions, however, from a poor to a nutritive pasture, and the\r\nreverse, are always bad, and therefore to be avoided; but change of\r\nfeeding ground, with these restrictions, cannot be too much\r\ninculcated--it is, in fact, the soul of sheep husbandry. The bleakest\r\nportions of a farm should be pastured off in autumn, so as to reserve\r\nthe sheltered spots for winter use. The cast ewes may then be drafted\r\noff to feed on a more succulent herbage, previous to being penned on\r\nturnips.\r\n\r\nMost of the points worthy of attention in sheep feeding having already\r\nbeen detailed in the article on _Crossing_, I shall only add a few\r\nparticulars in regard to management on turnips.\r\n\r\nWhen sheep are fed on turnips, they are in general confined to a\r\nparticular portion of the field by nets or hurdles. The latter, when\r\nmade of Scotch fir, cost about a shilling each; but, when constructed\r\nof larch, the price is fourteen-pence. Those made of larch are by far\r\nthe more durable, and will last three years if kept under cover during\r\nsummer. Two men are required to set them up, besides a horse and cart\r\nto take them to the field, on which account nets have a decided\r\npreference, being easy of transportation, and requiring little\r\nhouse-room. Though valuable in windy situations, nets cannot be used to\r\nenclose horned sheep, as their heads become entangled with the cords.\r\nThey will seldom serve for more than three years, but as they cost only\r\nthreepence per yard, they may be considered as every way cheaper than\r\nhurdles.\r\n\r\nWhen the turnips allotted to the sheep, which seldom exceed a week's\r\nsupply, are consumed, another portion of the field is enclosed; while\r\nthe shells are torn up with a two-pronged hook, and either left there\r\nto be consumed by the flock, or carted to another field for the use of\r\nsheep not then intended to be fattened. A fresh supply should always be\r\nafforded them before the old one is eaten clean, otherwise their\r\nfattening will be much retarded. It is usual to allow them at the same\r\ntime plenty of salt, placed up and down the field in troughs or\r\nboxes,[21] and about a ton of hay in the ten or fourteen days, to every\r\nhundred sheep; though that number, if supplied with what, and permitted\r\nto run about, will consume that quantity in a week. In spring, from\r\nhalf a pound to a pound of oil cake is given daily to each of them,\r\nalong with turnips.\r\n\r\n        [21] Old casks, wanting ends, form the best of all contrivances\r\n        for holding salt for sheep, as when laid on their sides, and\r\n        retained in that position by stakes, they allow the sheep free\r\n        admission, at the same time that the salt is defended from\r\n        rain.\r\n\r\nIn places where the cold during spring is any way severe, the Swedish\r\nturnip ought always to be preferred for feeding sheep, as from the\r\nformation of the upper part of the bulb, water cannot collect within it\r\nas it does in other varieties, to their serious injury when frost sets\r\nin.\r\n\r\nTurnips must be cut for such sheep as are shedding their teeth. The\r\nmouths of those that refuse to eat them should be examined, that in the\r\nevent of a tooth being loose or broken it may be removed. Occasionally\r\na sheep will be unable to gnaw a turnip, owing to a peculiar formation\r\nof the head, the lower jaw being so very short as to give the profile\r\nsome resemblance to that of a pig. Such deformed animals are said in\r\nthis quarter to be _grun_-(ground)-mouthed: I believe from the\r\nelongation of the nose suiting them better for poking in the earth than\r\nfor feeding in the usual way.\r\n\r\nThe fattening of sheep on turnips is much promoted by their having\r\naccess to a grass field, more especially if it happen to contain whins\r\nor heather. It is from want of attention to this that sheep are so\r\nliable to disease when eating turnips, for, apart from the benefit that\r\naccrues to them from a dry lair, they are enabled to turn their food to\r\nbetter account when consuming bitter herbs. It is no unusual thing for\r\nturnip-fed sheep and cattle to become quite lean, as the farmers say,\r\n\"almost at the lifting,\" for no other reason than that they have been\r\nconfined too strictly to one article of diet. They have been denied\r\naccess to plants containing of all things the one most necessary for\r\nthe maintenance of their health--_bitter extractive matter_--as it is\r\ncalled by chemists--without a due proportion of which the most\r\nnutritious substances cannot be turned to account. \"As an essential\r\ningredient in the provender of herbivorous animals, it may, I think, be\r\nadmitted as a fact, that its importance is _in an inverse ratio_ with\r\nthe nutritive powers of the food.\"[22] Thus accounting for the length\r\nof time that sheep will continue to thrive on turnips alone.\r\n\r\n        [22] Paris's Pharmacologia, sixth edition, vol. i. p. 147.\r\n\r\nWith all the advantages, however, which accrue to the sheep when on\r\nturnips, from the quantity of nutritive matter which these roots\r\ncontain, its progress when restricted to them frequently falls very far\r\nshort of the expectations of the owner. In the greater number of\r\ninstances, also, farmers are unable to account for their want of\r\nsuccess in this department, so that I may be excused for endeavouring\r\nto point out, at some length, the causes of their failure. To\r\nproceed:--\r\n\r\nThe point in sheep management in which our farmers are most deficient,\r\nis turnip-feeding; one upon which most will pique themselves as being\r\nperfect, though, speaking guardedly, hardly one man in twenty\r\nunderstands the rudimentary principles on which sheep-feeding should be\r\nconducted. They are unacquainted with the habits of the wild animal,\r\nand, unlike any other class of men, interest themselves little in the\r\nfundamental study of their calling. There is not a showman, or a\r\nbird-fancier, but knows to a tittle the peculiarities of the creature\r\nthat he has in charge, and endeavours, to the best of his ability, to\r\nprovide such food as its instincts crave. Not so, however, with the\r\nstore-farmer. He cares not to inquire whether the sheep is naturally\r\ncalculated to subsist on one kind of nutriment; and if so, whether they\r\nwill, when left to the exercise of instinct, resort to turnips of their\r\nown accord; whether the sheep is usually restricted to confined\r\nlocalities similar to our fields, or is the unrestrained rover over an\r\nextensive pasture. Yet it is from investigations of this kind that we\r\nare to derive our mode of treating sheep, and are to form plans\r\nbeneficial to ourselves, from their being, in a manner, improvements\r\nupon nature. We find, from a perusal of the works of travellers, and\r\nfrom the anatomical peculiarities of the sheep, that it is fitted for\r\nresidence in countries precipitous in surface, and scantily supplied\r\nwith herbage; consequently, it must range over a vast extent of ground\r\nfor a subsistence, and its food must, owing to the varied features of\r\nthe country, consist, not of one or of a few plants, but of a most\r\nextensive mixture of herbage. Experiment also points out that the\r\ndeductions from these observations are correct. Sheep, in fact, consume\r\na greater number of plants than any other domestic animal. Linnaeus, in\r\nexamining into this subject, found, by offering fresh plants to such\r\nanimals, in the ordinary mode of feeding, that horses ate 262 species,\r\nand refused 212; cattle ate 276 species, and refused 218; while sheep\r\ntook 387 species, and only refused 141. We find, too, great difficulty\r\nin preventing sheep from springing over the dykes and hedges that we\r\nplace as boundaries to their rambling habits, yet how seldom do we see\r\nthe true cause of their determination to set them at defiance. We may\r\npartly account for it by considering their analogy to the goat, and\r\ntheir propensity to scale rugged eminences; but I think these movements\r\nrather indicate an anxiety to change a pasture already exhausted of\r\nvariety, for fresh fields, and herbage abounding in that miscellaneous\r\nprovision which nature apparently reckons essential for them. Shepherds\r\nown as much, and will tell you that frequent change of pasture is the\r\nsoul of sheep husbandry, though they see no reason why sheep should not\r\nbe kept for many successive weeks on a patch of turnips. They admit the\r\nnecessity of a frequent shifting in the one case, but deny it in the\r\nother. Magendie, a celebrated French physiologist, has shown, by\r\nexperiment, that it is impossible to keep an animal in a healthy state\r\nlonger than six weeks on one article of diet, death frequently taking\r\nplace even before the end of that period; but our sheep-farmers, in\r\nhappy ignorance of the fact, confine their flocks for months to turnips\r\nonly. And what, may I ask them, is the consequence of the practice?\r\nWhy, that it is not unusual to meet with sheep-owners who lose at least\r\none out of every fifteen, and all owing, as may easily be proved, to\r\nthis mode of management. In the first place, the turnip is a kind of\r\nfood entirely foreign to the nature of the sheep, and one to which, at\r\nfirst, they evince great repugnance. There are many varieties of sheep\r\nincapable of feeding on turnips, owing to the form of the face, the\r\nupper-jaw projecting considerably past the lower, hindering the\r\nchisel-shaped teeth from being brought to bear upon the root. None of\r\nour British breeds certainly have this as a regular feature,\r\nnevertheless they are liable to it; and there are few farmers that have\r\nnot, several times in their lives, met with _grun-mouthed_ sheep, as\r\nthey are called in Scotland, from their profile resembling that of the\r\npig, and suiting them for poking in earth, rather than for eating in\r\nthe usual way. Again, if the structure of the sheep's mouth proves that\r\nit is not adapted for eating turnips, the composition of the turnip no\r\nless satisfactorily shows that it is not calculated as food for sheep.\r\nBitterness is essentially necessary in the food of all herbivorous\r\nanimals; without it, indeed, they sooner or later fall into ill health.\r\nThis property is shown by chemists to reside in the extractive matter\r\nof plants, which has, therefore, been called _bitter extractive_. The\r\nquantity is also found to be in the inverse ratio of the nutritive\r\npowers of the plant; that is to say, where the plant abounds in\r\nalimentary matter, the proportion of bitter extractive is small,\r\ncompared with what it is where the former is deficient. Turnips contain\r\na large quantity of matter capable of affording nourishment to the\r\nbody, but they yield little or none of the bitter principle. In\r\nconsequence of this, sheep acquire fat rapidly for a time, when placed\r\non turnips; but, experiencing a want of the medicinal bitter, begin\r\nwith equal rapidity to lose the advantages they so recently gained.\r\nTheir appetite becomes depraved, and, from being shut out from access\r\nto the stomachic intended for them by nature, they take to devouring\r\nearth, or any substance capable of serving as a substitute for it.\r\n\"With regard to the natural use of bitter extractive, it may be laid\r\ndown as a truth, that it stimulates the stomach,--corrects putrefying\r\nand unwholesome nutriment,--promotes tardy digestion,--increases the\r\nnutritive powers of those vegetable substances to which it is\r\nunited,--and furnishes a natural remedy for the deranged functions of\r\nthe stomach in particular, and through the sympathetic medium of that\r\norgan, for the atony of remote parts in general.\"[23] All, indeed,\r\nconcur in setting a high value on this constituent of plants--all, with\r\nthe exception of those whose interests are most deeply concerned in a\r\nknowledge of its importance. Farmers, in general, cannot perceive the\r\nutility of attending to concerns apparently so trifling, though in the\r\nright conduct of these they depend materially for success. Nay, I have\r\nknown men arguing, that in six weeks they have given ordinary sheep an\r\nexcellent coating of fat, by keeping them on turnips only; though, on\r\nstrict inquiry being made into the nature of the field in which they\r\nhad been penned, it has always turned out that the sheep had access to\r\nother things, their owners having wilfully shut their eyes to the true\r\ncircumstances of the case. Depend on it, no sheep will continue in\r\nhealth during six weeks on turnips alone, much less will it continue\r\nthroughout that time to take on fat. Much of the mischief attending a\r\nwant of bitter matter is obviated by the plan of allowing the sheep\r\ncorn, salt, oilcake, and hay, which, serve, especially the last, as\r\ntolerable substitutes for it. Good hay ought always to be plentifully\r\nsupplied to sheep on turnips, as, from the variety of the plants\r\ncomposing it, it contains much that is not to be found in turnips.\r\nBesides, one of the most useful bitters with which we are acquainted\r\n(the _Bogbean--Menyanthes Trifoliata_) occurs in meadow hay, and is a\r\nplant sufficient of itself to save the animal from the consequences of\r\nneglect. Whenever you hear of remarkable instances of sheep becoming\r\nquickly fat on turnips, you may safely believe they have had liberty to\r\nnibble something in addition to the ordinary provender. They have had\r\naccess to broom or whins, perhaps only to bushes that are laid as a\r\ndefence on dykes, or only to the scanty pickings on the edges of\r\nfields--still they have by such means in a manner satisfied the craving\r\nfor bitter aliment, and enabled their stomachs to turn to better\r\naccount the otherwise unprofitable turnips. Broom is at all times an\r\nexcellent medicine for sheep, and one which they are partial to, and\r\nwhich ought, therefore, to be placed, if possible, within their reach.\r\n\r\n        [23] Paris's Pharmacologia, vol. i. p. 146.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTS AND OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n(104.) Sheep being about as liable as other animals to a variety of\r\naccidents, it is necessary that the shepherd should possess a competent\r\nknowledge of the means which art affords for the remedy of those\r\nmishaps. It is from a want of such knowledge that farmers are\r\nfrequently led to slaughter valuable sheep, though only labouring under\r\nthe effects of some commonplace disease or accident. If the animal is\r\nattended by a professional person, an expense is sure to be incurred\r\nnearly equal to the worth of the patient, and in so far as they\r\nendeavour to obviate this, by killing the sheep, they are free from\r\nblame; but why not rather contrive to save the cost of veterinary\r\nattendance, by making themselves conversant with its diseases, and able\r\nto prescribe for their own flocks, in which there can be no difficulty,\r\nas the remedies are, in the majority of cases, few, simple, and of easy\r\napplication. In the surgical and medical management of flocks, much\r\nmystery has, as in other matters, all along existed; but that fantastic\r\nage is well nigh its close, and thanks to the spirit of candid inquiry\r\nnow abroad, we may hope ere long to boast of valuable information in\r\nthis department. The spread of correct ideas regarding the nature and\r\ntreatment of accidents and diseases, has from first to last been\r\nprevented by the diffuseness of those who have written on the subject,\r\nand by their so clothing it in a mass of verbiage, as to render\r\nscarcely intelligible what would otherwise be easy of acquirement. To\r\nobviate the liability to a similar charge, the following observations\r\nare given as briefly as is consistent with a due regard to the\r\nimportance of the subject.\r\n\r\n(105.) _Wounds._ All the wounds which can be inflicted may be\r\nclassed under the heads of incised, punctured, and lacerated.\r\n\r\nAn incised wound is one made by a cutting instrument, such as a knife\r\nor a piece of glass.\r\n\r\nPunctured wounds are those produced by sharp pointed bodies, such as\r\npins or thorns.\r\n\r\nLacerated wounds are those occasioned by blunt bodies, as the teeth of\r\nthe dog, tearing rather than cutting the flesh.\r\n\r\nWhen a sheep has received any of these injuries, the following rules\r\nought to be attended to, and in the order here recommended:--\r\n\r\n    1st. Arrest the bleeding, if profuse, and likely to endanger life.\r\n\r\n    2d. Clip away the wool for a few inches around the injured part.\r\n\r\n    3d. Remove dirt or other foreign body from the wound.\r\n\r\n    4th. Bring the separated parts as nearly together as circumstances\r\n    will at the moment permit, and retain them there by suitable\r\n    apparatus.\r\n\r\n(106.) _To stop Bleeding._ Bleeding will, if no large arteries are\r\ndivided, cease on the free exposure of the surface for a few minutes to\r\nthe air; but when a large vessel has been cut, more determined means\r\nmust be had recourse to. Pressure on the bleeding surface and its\r\nneighbourhood will in many cases succeed, but this or any similar\r\nmethod is far inferior to that of securing the open vessel by a thread.\r\nTo accomplish this, the mouth of the vein or artery must be slightly\r\ndrawn out from the contiguous surface, by means of a small hook, called\r\nby surgeons a tenaculum, and easily procured from any blacksmith. While\r\nthe mouth of the vessel is thus held exposed, an assistant must\r\nsurround it with a noose of thread, which, on being secured with a\r\ndouble knot, will effectually close it. The thread ought to be of white\r\nsilk, though any undyed thread, which is firm, round, and capable of\r\nstanding a pull, will answer the purpose. Care must be taken to place\r\nthe thread, before tying it, fairly behind the point of the tenaculum,\r\nso as to avoid including the instrument within the ligature, a\r\ncircumstance which would lead to the slipping of the noose and failure\r\nof the operation. The hook is now to be withdrawn, and one end of the\r\nligature cut off by scissars within a little of the noose. The\r\nremaining threads are allowed to hang out of the wound, so as to admit\r\nof their removal when they become loose, which does not, however, take\r\nplace till the termination of the first four days, and they are\r\nfrequently retained for a much longer period. At each time the wound is\r\ndressed, after the fourth day, the ligatures should be _gently pulled_,\r\nor, which is preferable, _twisted_, to disengage them, if at all loose,\r\nso that the wound may be more speedily closed. Before proceeding to any\r\noperation where bleeding is expected, the operator should provide\r\nhimself with a few well-waxed threads, each twelve inches long, so that\r\nno delay may ensue on a division of large vessels.\r\n\r\n(107.) _Removal of Extraneous Matter._ Dirt is best removed by washing\r\nwith a sponge or old linen rag and warm water. Other foreign bodies may\r\nin general be extracted by the finger and thumb. In some cases,\r\nhowever, it may be necessary to dilate or enlarge the wound with a\r\nfine-edged knife, in order to facilitate the removal of substances\r\nwhich, from their shape or situation, cannot be otherwise displaced.\r\n\r\n(108.) _Closure of a Wound._ The last thing to be done is to bring the\r\nedges of the wound into as accurate contact as the state of the parts\r\nwill at the moment permit, without, however, using any force. This,\r\nwith a little care, is readily accomplished, the only difficulty being\r\nto retain them in the desired position. They may be held in contact\r\neither by _stitches_, (sutures,) _plasters_, or _bandages_, or by a\r\nunion of the three. Stitches are only required when the wound gapes to\r\na considerable extent, as it will always do when running across a\r\nmuscle. They may be applied in the following manner. Transfix one side\r\nof the wound with a curved needle (armed with a well waxed thread)\r\nforcing the needle _from without_ obliquely towards the bottom of the\r\nwound, then carry it through the opposite side _from within_, taking\r\ncare to bring it out about the same distance from the edge as that at\r\nwhich it entered on the other margin. The needle must now be removed,\r\nby cutting the threads close to its eye, and while the ends are allowed\r\nto hang loose, the same operation should be repeated, at the distance\r\nof an inch or an inch and a half from the first stitch, as often as the\r\nlength of the wound may render necessary. Your assistant will now bring\r\nthe sides of the wound together as accurately as possible, and retain\r\nthem there till you have tied the corresponding ends of the threads in\r\na double knot.\r\n\r\n(109.) _Bandaging._ Adhesive plaster is in some instances of service,\r\nbut upon the whole ought rather to be dispensed with, being of\r\ndifficult application, and moreover tending to the accumulation of\r\nfilth and the discomfort of the animal. Nothing will be found to serve\r\nthe purpose of supporting the parts so well as a properly adjusted\r\nbandage, which is useful in every instance, and sure to stay on if\r\nsewed here and there to the fleece. The bandage should never be omitted\r\nwhere the wound has any tendency to gape, as too great a strain upon\r\nthe stitches cannot but lead to delay in the healing process. In\r\nbandaging a limb or part of a limb, commence _always at the foot_, and\r\nproceed upwards; in other parts of the body begin where you find it\r\nmost convenient. Before applying a bandage to an injured surface, a\r\ncouple of pieces of old linen of cotton rag should be folded into pads\r\nor compresses, and laid _one on each side of the cut_, and over these\r\nthe bandage should be rolled, evenly and with moderate and uniform\r\nfirmness. By this plan the separated surfaces are supported and\r\npreserved in close juxtaposition, especially at the bottom of the\r\nwound, a thing of some importance where the cavity is deep. Transverse\r\ncuts of the limbs of sheep require more careful and more complicated\r\ntreatment than cuts in other parts, as there is a constant tendency of\r\nthe edges to retract. This retraction of the edges may be in some\r\ndegree obviated by the application of a splint, which may be made of a\r\nslip of stiff leather (such as is used for saddle flaps) well wetted,\r\nso as to be easily adapted to the form of the limb. It is intended to\r\nimpede the motion of the leg, which occasions the gaping of the wound,\r\nand must therefore be made to pass over one or more joints as\r\ncircumstances may require. Tow must be laid along the surface (a sound\r\none if possible) on which the leather is to be placed, and a bandage\r\nthen rolled over it so as to make all secure.\r\n\r\n(110.) _Clean cuts_, as every one knows, heal readily in a healthy\r\nanimal, seldom demanding above three dressings; lacerations, on the\r\nother hand, require a longer period for their reparation, inasmuch as\r\nthe process which nature goes through is more complicated. In the\r\nformer, the parts are speedily glued together, so soon almost as in\r\ncontact, and the union is generally complete within the first\r\nthirty-six hours. Not so, however, with the latter. Here the parts are\r\nbruised, torn, and perhaps to a considerable extent awanting. Some of\r\nthe bruised portions may die, and are of course to be renewed. This is\r\na process requiring a great effort on the part of the vital powers,\r\nwhich are often inadequate to the task, and on this account we ought,\r\nwhen the injury is severe, to sacrifice the animal rather than run the\r\nrisk of its dying during the process of the attempted cure. To replace\r\nthe lost part, suppuration, or the formation of _matter_ commences;\r\nwhile under cover of this, a crop of fleshy particles (granulations)\r\nrise to fill the vacancy. Granulations are best promoted by warm\r\nemollient applications, such as poultices of oatmeal, linseed-meal, or\r\nbarley-flour, which ought to be frequently renewed to prevent their\r\nbecoming cold or dry. When the granulations become too luxuriant, and\r\nrise, as they are apt to do, above the level of the skin, the poultices\r\nmust be laid aside, the sore washed once or twice a-day with a\r\n_solution_ of sulphate of copper (made by dissolving two or three\r\ndrachms of blue vitriol in an English pint of soft water), and covered\r\ncarefully over with a pledget of fine tow, spread with lard, or any\r\nsimple ointment, by which means, conjoined with cleanliness, a cure\r\nwill easily be accomplished.\r\n\r\n(111.) _Punctured Wounds._ The orifice being small in these, and the\r\ndepth considerable, the sides are apt to adhere irregularly, and\r\nprevent the free escape of matter, which is certain to collect at the\r\nbottom. To avoid such occurrences, it is in many cases proper to\r\nconvert a punctured into an incised wound. When, from neglecting this,\r\nthe matter is denied an outlet, an incision must be made to allow it to\r\nescape, otherwise much harm will ensue from its burrowing between the\r\ndifferent textures. Fomentations will also here be serviceable, and\r\nshould be preferred to poultices. To apply them, place well-boiled\r\nmeadow hay, when very hot and moist, within a fold of old blanket or\r\nwoollen cloth, and lay it on the injured parts, taking care to renew\r\nthe heat frequently, by dipping the bundle in the hot decoction.\r\n\r\n(112.) _Bruises and Sprains._ These, unless severe, need not be\r\ninterfered with. When the shepherd, however, considers it necessary to\r\nmake any application, he cannot do better than foment the part for an\r\nhour or so with meadow hay, in the same manner as recommended for\r\npunctured wounds.\r\n\r\n(113.) _Wounds of Joints._ Such wounds are highly dangerous and apt to\r\nbaffle the most experienced. _The grand object in every case, however,\r\nwhere a cure is attempted, is to produce a speedy union of the wound,\r\nas directed in_ (108) to (109). If the injury be extensive, the best\r\nthing the farmer can do is to slaughter the animal.\r\n\r\n(114.) _Poisoned Wounds._ It is said that sheep are sometimes bitten by\r\nsnakes, and strange stories are told of their milk being sucked by\r\nthese reptiles. In such a case but small dependence can be placed on\r\nany inward treatment, beyond the administration of one or two full\r\ndoses of castor oil. If the bite can be discovered, the part should be\r\nfrequently fomented with a decoction of meadow hay and foxglove\r\n(_fairy-cap_ of the Irish, and _bluidy-finger_ of the Scotch).\r\n\r\n(115.) _Fractures._ If there be no wound of the soft parts, the bone\r\nbeing simply broken, the treatment is extremely easy. Apply a piece of\r\nwet leather, as recommended at (109), taking care to ease the limb when\r\nswelling supervenes. When the swelling is considerable, and fever\r\npresent, you cannot do better than open a vein of the head or neck,\r\nallowing a quantity of blood to escape, proportioned to the size and\r\ncondition of the animal and the urgency of the symptoms. The exhibition\r\nof purgatives should never be neglected. Epsom salt, in one ounce\r\ndoses, given either as a gruel or a drench, will be found to answer the\r\npurpose well. If the broken bones are kept steady, the cure will be\r\ncomplete in from three weeks to a month, the process of reunion always\r\nproceeding faster in a young than in an old sheep. Should the soft\r\nparts be injured to any extent, or the ends of the bone protruding,\r\nrecovery is very uncertain, and it will become a question whether it\r\nwould not be better at once to convert the animal into mutton; indeed,\r\nremoval of portions of bone and amputation, of which some well known\r\nwriters on the surgery of the sheep speak so learnedly and confidently,\r\nmay be viewed, as, in this case, chimerical, if not absurd.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS.\r\n\r\n(116.) _Cutting Lambs._ Polled sheep should be castrated about the\r\ntenth day after birth, but the end of the fifth week is soon enough for\r\nhorned sheep, as early castration has always a tendency to spoil the\r\nbeauty of the horns. The risk is always in proportion to the age,\r\ntherefore no great length of time ought ever to elapse from the period\r\nof birth to that of the operation. A large flock of ewes and lambs\r\nshould never be collected preparatory to cutting, as the latter, from\r\nthe excitement and crowding, are less likely to recover from the\r\noperation. It is much better to take up a small number so soon as they\r\nare ready. Instead of driving them about in attempts to secure them, it\r\nwill be safer to station a person at a division of the fold, who may\r\nlay hold of them individually as they are made to pass through slowly.\r\nThe best method of cutting is to grasp the bag containing the testicles\r\nwith the left hand, so as to tighten the skin, and push them forward,\r\nafter which an incision may be made through the skin at the end of the\r\nbag, large enough to permit the stones to pass. They may then be\r\nremoved either by cutting or tearing; the latter plan, however, is the\r\nbetter, as there is little risk of bleeding, which is almost sure to\r\nprove troublesome if the former be adopted. At this time a portion of\r\nthe tail ought to be removed, if it has not been done at an earlier\r\nperiod, as a remedy for pinding. The bleeding will serve to lessen the\r\ndanger consequent on the previous operation. When all have been\r\noperated on, the ewes may be allowed to find their lambs, and the whole\r\nconducted _quietly_ to their pasture.\r\n\r\n(117.) _Blood-letting._ In describing this operation, too much stress\r\nis always laid on the importance of opening particular veins, or\r\ndivisions of a vein, in certain diseases. Such directions are\r\naltogether unnecessary, as _it matters not from what part of the animal\r\nthe blood be drawn, provided it be taken quickly_. Nothing tends so\r\nmuch to the recovery of an animal from a disease in which bleeding is\r\nrequired, as the rapid flow of the blood from a large orifice. Little\r\n_impression_ can be made on an acute disease by the slow removal of\r\neven a large quantity of blood, as the organs have time to accommodate\r\nthemselves to the loss, which might, for any good it will do, as well\r\nbe dispensed with. Either bleed rapidly or not at all. The nearer the\r\ncommencement of an ailment, in which you employ bleeding, the operation\r\nis resorted to, the greater the chance of its doing good; no time\r\nought, therefore, to be lost in using the lancet, when once it is known\r\nto be required. Bleeding by nicking the under surface of the tail does\r\nvery well where no great deal of blood is required, but it is not to be\r\nthought of if the veins of the face or neck can possibly be opened.\r\nThese are to be taken in preference to a vein on the leg, as they are\r\nmuch more readily got at. The facial vein (_f.v._ Fig. 3. Pl. III.)\r\ncommences by small branches on the side of the face, and runs downwards\r\nand backwards to the base of the jaw, where it may be felt within two\r\ninches of the angle, or opposite the middle grinding tooth. It is here\r\nthat the orifice must be made, the thumb of the left hand being held\r\nagainst the vein, so as to prevent the flow of blood towards the heart,\r\nwill make it _rise_. Some prefer opening the jugular vein (_j.v._ Fig.\r\n3. P1.), which commences behind the eye and runs down the side of the\r\nneck. This vessel is, however, more difficult to open than the former,\r\nbeing better covered with wool, and not so easily exposed or made to\r\nswell. _Stringing_ is the mode commonly resorted to for this end; that\r\nis to say a cord is drawn tightly round the neck, close to the\r\nshoulder, so as to stop the circulation through the vein, and render it\r\nperceptible to the finger. A lancet is the instrument generally used in\r\nbleeding, though a well-pointed pen knife will do at a pinch. The\r\nopening must always be made obliquely, in the direction marked in the\r\ncut; but before attempting this, the animal must be secured, by placing\r\nit between the operator's legs, with its croup against a wall. The\r\nselected vein is then fixed by the fingers of the operator's left hand,\r\nso as to prevent it rolling or slipping before the lancet. Having\r\nfairly entered the vein, the point of the instrument must be elevated,\r\nat the same time that it is pushed a little forward, by which motion it\r\nwill be lifted from or cut its way out of the vein. _A prescribed\r\nquantity of blood should never be drawn_, for the simple reason that\r\nthis can never be precisely stated. If the symptoms are urgent, as in\r\nall likelihood they will, your best plan is not to stop the flow of\r\nblood till the animal fall or is about to fall. When this occurs, run a\r\npin through the edges of the orifice, and finish by twisting round it a\r\nlock of wool.\r\n\r\n(118.) _Removal of Hydatids from within the head._ This animal, and the\r\nsymptoms which it causes, I have fully described at (169). Their\r\nremoval has been attempted in a variety of ways, but the simplest\r\nmethod, and one most likely to succeed, is that followed in this\r\nquarter. A couple of incisions, forming when completed the letter T,\r\nare made in the integument covering the soft part of the bone under\r\nwhich the hydatid is supposed to be. Two flaps are in this way marked\r\nout, and are dissected back so as to expose the skull. The yielding\r\nportion of the latter is then pared away, which brings the sac into\r\nview. This will be seen alternately to sink and rise, following in this\r\nrespect the motions of the brain. A moderate-sized needle, slightly\r\ncurved and filled with thread, is now passed through the exposed\r\nportion of the cyst, and the thread allowed to remain. The fluid is\r\nthus permitted slowly to escape, and at the same time the sac becomes\r\ncollapsed, after which it is easily removed by pulling gently at the\r\nthread with which it is connected. As good a hold should be taken with\r\nthe string as possible, and all the water should be allowed to flow out\r\nbefore any attempt is made to extract the remains of the hydatid. To\r\nconclude the operation, lay down the flaps of skin in their original\r\nposition, covering them with a small piece of folded linen smeared with\r\nlard, and over all apply a cap. Never try to save the bone which you\r\ncut, by turning it back in the form of a lid, for by so doing you will\r\nonly endanger the life of the animal, which is otherwise in little\r\njeopardy.\r\n\r\nIt will often happen that the hydatid, from being in the interior of\r\nthe brain, will not be brought into view by the removal of a portion of\r\nthe skull. In this case the brain must be punctured in order to reach\r\nthe sac and evacuate its contents.\r\n\r\nWhen the skull above the eye is very thin, the disease may be at once\r\nended by cautiously thrusting a short, stout, sharp-pointed piece of\r\nsteel wire through the skin and bone down towards the centre of the\r\nbrain, taking care to pull the skin a little to one side before making\r\nthe puncture, so that on letting it loose the openings in the skull and\r\nintegument will not be opposite to one another. This plan is much\r\nsuperior to that of thrusting a needle up the nostril, in the manner\r\ndevised by Mr Hogg, as in his way we are always poking in the dark, in\r\nignorance of the situation of the instrument, and are in all\r\nprobability doing so much injury to the delicate parts within the nose\r\nas to preclude the possibility of recovery. Indeed, I some time ago\r\nexamined a head on which Mr Hogg's operation had been twice\r\nunsuccessfully performed, and found traces of inflammation at the upper\r\npart of the nostril severe enough of itself to have occasioned death.\r\nThe needle had not entered the brain, but the ethmoid was very much\r\ninjured. I believe the instrument is very seldom pushed more than half\r\nway through the bone, at least it never reaches the hydatid, which\r\nwould appear to be destroyed rather by the inflammatory process which\r\nfollows the attempt, unfitting the brain for supplying it with the\r\nsecretions on which it lives, than by any direct injury done to it by\r\nthe needle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF SHEEP.\r\n\r\n\r\n(119.) There is no department in the management of sheep so little\r\nunderstood as the nature and treatment of their diseases. Every part of\r\nthe sheep itself has been used, at one time or another, in this\r\ncountry, as medicine for _man_, a folly still prevailing among the\r\nboors of Southern Africa, who, according to Thunberg, employ the inner\r\ncoat of the stomach, dried and powdered, as a safe emetic. Quackish\r\nabsurdities of so glaring a nature have, however, long been scorned in\r\ncivilized society. Not so, however, when the sheep is the object of\r\ntreatment. Scientific innovations have been slow in reaching it, and\r\nspecimens of barbarian usage are far from rare. We may feel for the\r\nbenighted credulity which could place reliance, for a rescue from\r\nmortal ailment, on the secretions or excretions of a sheep; but we are\r\ncompelled to laugh on reading, in the _Family Dictionary_, published in\r\n1752, the following:--\r\n\r\n\"In general, 'tis affirmed that the belly of a sheep boiled in water\r\nand wine, and given the sheep to drink, cures several diseases incident\r\nto them.\"\r\n\r\nOnly fancy a farmer dosing a sheep with mutton broth, and adding, for\r\nits stomach's sake, a little wine! I suspect the prescriber was, in\r\nthis instance, putting himself, in point of intellect, far below the\r\nlevel of his patient. Thanks to him, however, for the benefit he has\r\nthus unwittingly conferred, by holding ignorance up to the derision it\r\nso richly merits; no means being so powerful as broadly-drawn\r\ncaricatures in exposing the extent of such delusions. Though faith has\r\nlong since ceased to be reposed in the medicinal virtues of mutton\r\nbroth, a variety of nostrums have from time to time appeared, the\r\ncomposition and application of which are invaluable for the amount of\r\n_negative_ information they are calculated to convey. Further notice of\r\nthese trashy recipes it is not my intention to take, as a list of them\r\nalone would make a volume;--they are in the hands of every one.\r\n\r\n(120.) _Cautions in prescribing._ Great reliance is in general placed\r\nupon prescriptions, which profess to suit diseases in every stage and\r\ncircumstance.--Than this, however, scarcely any thing can be more\r\nabsurd. It is an opinion engendered not so much by ignorance as by\r\nlaziness, a determination not to be put about by thinking of a remedy\r\nfor the evils which surround us, but, while we contrive to soothe\r\nourselves by doing _something_, to leave every thing to the hit-or-miss\r\npractice of charlatans.[24] There are many, who on being informed of\r\nthe presence of disease in a neighbour's flock, confidently advise the\r\nemployment of a favourite nostrum, on the empirical supposition that\r\nbecause it cured, or was thought to cure, one flock, it will cure\r\nanother. Nothing is taken into account saving that, in both cases, the\r\naffected animals are sheep; and it is at once concluded, that what\r\nbenefited one will benefit another. The many niceties in prescribing\r\nare never thought of: oh no, that would be of no use! of course it can\r\nbe of no importance to give a moment's attention to age and sex,\r\npasture and situation, or to leanness or fatness, or to the presence of\r\npregnancy! These are of trifling moment, and only to be despised by a\r\nperson armed with a recipe, which some one has shown to be capable of\r\nwalking like a constable through the body, and bearing off the\r\nintruder! But enough of this; sufficient has, I think, been said to\r\nprove the utter folly of confiding in things of the above nature or\r\nintention, and to show that such confidence can lead to nothing but a\r\nwaste of life and capital. Even though the remedy is a harmless one, it\r\nought (unless calculated from _known_ powers to arrest the disease) to\r\nbe viewed with distrust, as incurring a loss of time, during which\r\nother and better measures might have been resorted to.\r\n\r\n        [24] Whenever we hear a person recommending a medicine of\r\n        universal virtues, we may safely set him down either for a fool\r\n        or an impostor. Things which are good for every thing are good\r\n        for nothing.\r\n\r\n(121.) _Classification of diseases._[25] As the acquirement of correct\r\nideas regarding the treatment of diseases is much facilitated by a\r\nsimple arrangement of the diseases themselves, numerous attempts have\r\nbeen made to accomplish it, and in a variety of ways. The best of these\r\ntabular views with which I am acquainted is the one laid before the\r\nHighland Society some years ago, by Mr Stevenson, who appears to have\r\nbeen the first to publish any thing like a satisfactory classification.\r\nHis arrangement is, however, defective in several points, more\r\nespecially as it necessitates the placing in the same division diseases\r\nof organs essentially different. Thus he is compelled to admit under\r\n\"Diseases of the head\" _Scabs on the mouth_ side by side with _Sturdy_,\r\nand _Louping ill_: in this way mingling affections of the skin with\r\ndiseases of totally different organs--the brain and spinal marrow--and\r\ncausing much embarassment to the reader. To obviate this inconvenience,\r\nas well as to render the remembrance of the remedies an easy matter, I\r\nhave adopted the above arrangement, in which each disease is placed\r\nopposite the textures it invades.\r\n\r\n        [25]\r\n\r\n        Diseases affecting\r\n\r\n                          {Blown or Blast.\r\n                          {Braxy, Sickness, or Blood.\r\n        The Stomach and   {Pining, Daising, Vinquish or Vanquish.\r\n        Intestines.       {Staggers.\r\n                          {Diarrhoea or Rush.\r\n                          {Dysentery, Cling, Breckshaw or\r\n                          { Breckshuach.\r\n\r\n                          {Scab or Itch.\r\n                          {Erysipelas or Wild-fire.\r\n                          {Red Water.\r\n                          {Leg Evil or Black-leg.[26]\r\n        The Skin and      {Inflammatory          {1.

When a sheep has been brought from a poor pasture to a\r\nrich one it is prone to gorge itself to an extent which may endanger\r\nlife. The lower end of the gullet becomes obstructed, the gases which\r\naccumulate in the paunch are hindered from escaping, and the latter\r\nbecomes so enormously distended as speedily to suffocate the animal by\r\nbeing forced into the chest.\r\n\r\n(123.) _Treatment[27] of Blown._ If the difficulty in breathing be only\r\nslight, keep the sheep moving _gently_ up and down as the air will thus\r\nhave a chance of escaping from the stomach. If the symptoms are more\r\nalarming, pass the elastic tube employed in the same complaint in\r\ncattle down the throat, or if that cannot be procured use a cane with\r\nan ivory or wooden bullet at the end of it. Never _stick_ the animal,\r\nas recovery by this plan is almost hopeless. If you cannot obtain the\r\naforesaid instruments, bleed the animal till it becomes very faint, and\r\nif this is of no avail proceed to kill it. Shepherds often prescribe a\r\npurgative dose after this occurrence. In general, however, it is not\r\nrequired. To prevent a flock becoming _blown_, always when, for the\r\nfirst time on rich pasture, make the dog move leisurely among them so\r\nas to prevent them feeding hastily.\r\n\r\n        [27] In speaking of remedial measures, the word treatment ought\r\n        to be used in preference to \"_cure_\" which figures at the head\r\n        of the medical advice in veterinary works. It is sheer nonsense\r\n        to blazon such a word in pages having any pretentions to\r\n        candour, for how seldom are we able conscientiously to affirm\r\n        that our endeavours will be followed by a _cure_. All we can do\r\n        is to pursue the _treatment_ best adapted for the attainment of\r\n        so desirable an end.\r\n\r\n(124.) _Braxy or Sickness._ Six or eight species of braxy are\r\nenumerated by shepherds, but as they all bear a striking resemblance\r\none to another, in their origin and progress, it is preferable to treat\r\nof them as one disease. Indeed wire-drawn distinctions, though\r\noccasionally serviceable in cattle-medicine, ought in most instances to\r\nbe avoided, as they are of but little avail, and in this disease\r\nstraw-splitting can only serve to tantalize the farmer, by giving rise\r\nto ideas of finical modes of treatment, which before the Chapter ends\r\nare reduced to the simplest aids which medicine affords. Whatever may\r\nbe the seat or seats of the disease, the identically same resources are\r\nemployed in all:--why therefore ought the reader to be troubled with a\r\nhundred trifling phases, which, not being _essential_ to the malady,\r\ncan only tend to perplex him in his search for the little that is\r\npractically available.\r\n\r\n(125.) _Symptoms of Braxy._ In those rare cases where the animal is\r\nseen at the commencement of the disease, it will appear uneasy, lying\r\ndown and rising up repeatedly, loathing food, and drinking frequently.\r\nIn a little while the symptoms become more decided, and fever shows\r\nitself. The wool is clapped, the skin hot, the pulse quick and strong,\r\nrespiration is rapid and laborious, while the blood is thick and black,\r\nissuing from the orifice, in attempts at bleeding, drop by drop.\r\nSometimes the heart beats irregularly: the mouth is parched, and the\r\neyes are red, languid, partly closed, and watery. The head is down, the\r\nback drawn up, and the belly swollen; there is scarcely any passage\r\nthrough the bowels, the urine is small in quantity, high coloured, and\r\nsometimes bloody. The sheep shuns the flock, slowly dragging itself to\r\nsome retired spot, where convulsed and screaming it shortly dies. Death\r\nmay occur in a few hours, or may, in some rare cases, be delayed for a\r\nweek. A fatal termination is not so sudden as some have fancied, since\r\nthe animal is in general seriously ill for many hours before it is\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n(126.) _Appearances on dissection._ Though many parts are commonly\r\nimplicated in the _sickness_, there is every reason for believing the\r\n_reed_ to be primarily affected. Inflammatory appearances, and\r\nmortification, the usual result of violent inflammation in this\r\nquarter, are visible on its coats, especially at the pyloric extremity\r\n(Plate I. Fig. 2, _py_.) The inner coat presents a blackish-red, and\r\ngelatinous appearance,--the entire bowel being soft, pulpy, and easily\r\npermeable to the finger. The intestines, kidneys, and bladder, will, in\r\nall probability, exhibit similar changes, while the lining membrane of\r\nthe abdomen (the _peritoneum_) is frequently affected: when this\r\nmembrane has been much inflamed, the intestines are glued together, are\r\nsurrounded with bloody or floculent serum, occasioning before death\r\ntumidity of the under part of the belly, and communicating, when\r\nstruck, a feeling of fluctuation to a hand placed at a distance from\r\nthe blow. The muscles in various parts of the body frequently\r\nparticipate in the disease, bloody serum being infiltrated between the\r\nlayers. As the brain, in severe cases, exhibits symptoms of oppression,\r\nso on dissection it will be found red and turgid, enabling us to\r\naccount for the convulsive movements during the termination of the\r\nmalady. The whole body, more particularly the abdomen, gives out a\r\nfetid gangrenous odour, which has procured for braxy the pastoral\r\nappellation of \"_stinking ill_\" and renders the dissection far from\r\npleasant. After death putrefaction goes on with great rapidity,\r\nespecially in moist weather, hence the necessity of testing the\r\nsolidity of the carcass by giving it, as is customary in some parts,\r\n_three shakes_ before proceeding to prepare it for household use!\r\n\r\n(128.) _Causes of Braxy._ Whatever tends to constipate the bowels may\r\nbe reckoned a predisposing cause. Whenever constipation occurs,\r\nespecially if on a sickrife pasture, the sheep may be looked upon as\r\nripe for the disease. Any crude indigestible substance, taken into the\r\nstomach when the animal is in this state, will have a tendency to\r\nkindle braxy, and the liability to it will not only be heightened, but\r\nthe chances of recovery will also be lessened, by the animal being in\r\nhigh condition.\r\n\r\nWedder hogs are peculiarly its victims, but only when hirsled, as when\r\nallowed to pasture with their mothers they are less liable to it. This\r\nis accounted for by the fact, that hirsled hogs are comparatively\r\n_dull_, not being familiar with the proper times for feeding, and\r\nincapable of selecting the suitable herbage, from having wanted the\r\ntutoring of the mother.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of November till the middle of March, _sickness_\r\ncommits its greatest ravages, especially among heath sheep, from their\r\nbeing more confined than others to dry binding provender. Frozen grass\r\nis also a common exciting cause, rapidly inducing inflammation by\r\nlowering the temperature of the stomachs so very much as to arrest\r\ndigestion, and lead to its acting as an irritant. The succulent grass\r\nin the sheltered hollows of mountains is more liable to frost than a\r\nsapless herbage, and to it, owing to its moisture, the young sheep\r\nresort, devouring it eagerly to assuage their thirst. Braxy, however,\r\nmay arise from other and more obvious causes. The sheep, perhaps when\r\nheated by rash dogging, is suddenly chilled by exposure to a shower, or\r\na plunge in a morass, and if the bowels be at the time any way bound\r\nup, immediate mischief cannot but ensue. One of the rarest accidents to\r\nwhich it has been attributed is the prevention of the passage of the\r\nfaeces by a knot, or intussusception, forming on the intestines, but\r\nthis occurrence would be of difficult discovery, and even if made\r\nknown, our treatment, though not differing much from that of braxy,\r\ncould hardly be successful.\r\n\r\n(128.) _Treatment of Braxy._ Recovery is in many instances almost\r\nhopeless, owing to the length of time which in general elapses between\r\nthe onset of the disease and the shepherd's discovery of the animal.\r\nNevertheless, the best treatment ought in every instance to have a\r\nproper trial, as life may often be saved when such a result is least\r\nexpected. Many plans have been resorted to, but none are found to suit\r\nso well as that of bleeding and purging. The first thing to be\r\nattempted is the procuring of a copious flow of blood, but, as before\r\nmentioned, this is a difficult matter, owing to the stagnant state of\r\nthe circulation at the surface of the body. Its abstraction may,\r\nhowever, be rendered easy, by placing the sheep in a tub of warm water,\r\nor, where this cannot be procured, by rolling a blanket wrung out of\r\nhot water round the body of the animal. The tub of water should always\r\nbe preferred, and the moment the sheep is placed in it, the tail should\r\nbe nicked, and one or both jugular veins opened.\r\n\r\nRetain the sheep in the bath for half an hour, adding hot water from\r\ntime to time, so as to sustain the original temperature. This of itself\r\nwill alleviate the sufferings of the animal.\r\n\r\nWhen a copious flow of blood has been obtained, remove the sheep from\r\nthe tub, and administer two ounces of Glauber's or Epsom salt,\r\ndissolved in warm water, substituting a handful of common salt when\r\nthese cathartics cannot be procured. It is needless to give a purgative\r\nwithout bleeding, as, till this is done, it will not operate. When in\r\nspite of this the bowels continue obstinately constipated, give a\r\nglyster of tobacco decoction, made by boiling a drachm of the leaf (the\r\nfull of a pipe will do) for a few minutes in a pint of water. Half of\r\nthis only should be injected, using the other if circumstances require\r\nit. Place the sheep in a house, or any comfortable situation, bed it\r\nwith straw, throw a horse-rug over it, and promote the purging by warm\r\ngruels. When out of danger supply it with moderate quantities of\r\nlaxative provender, and keep it for ten days apart from its fellows, by\r\nwhich time it will, in all likelihood, be well recruited.\r\n\r\n(129.) _Prevention of Braxy._ Change of pasture will at once suggest\r\nitself. Let it be to a succulent one, on which old sheep have been for\r\nsome time feeding; the hogs will thus be hindered from filling their\r\npaunches too rapidly. But, if heathy food is the staple provender,\r\nallow your sheep four or five hours of turnips in the twenty-four,\r\npermitting at the same time free access to common salt. These, from\r\ntheir laxative effects, will serve as antidotes to the dry sapless\r\ngrasses, which have led to the disease. Such places as mossy soils,\r\nabounding in evergreen plants, will also serve the purpose. Burn your\r\nley heather, as nothing is more decidedly prejudicial, not only from\r\nits constipating qualities, but also from being surrounded by a grass,\r\nwhich is so much relished by the sheep, that they resort to the spot\r\nlong after it has been eaten to the quick, and devour in their\r\neagerness much that is foul and unwholesome from frequent puddling. You\r\nthus obtain a good supply of sprouts, as invaluable for opening\r\nqualities, as the old heather is to be dreaded for its astringency.\r\nFinally, be aware that careful herding is not the least efficacious of\r\npreventives; a quiet, even-tempered, and thoughtful shepherd, being\r\nhere of far more value than the stores of the apothecary.\r\n\r\n(130.) _Pining._ _Symptoms and Causes._ The name has arisen from the\r\nrapid wasting, which is a prominent symptom in this complaint. A farm\r\ncan hardly be subject to a more ruinous distemper, as the same sheep\r\nwill be affected by it year after year, and if a ewe be attacked during\r\nautumn it is ten to one she will not have a lamb in the ensuing season.\r\nPining only seizes on thriving sheep, preferring young ones, those more\r\nespecially of the larger breeds, and is confined to farms where the\r\nland is principally micaceous and covered with occasional stripes of\r\nbenty grasses. A whole flock sickens at once, their usual alacrity\r\nappears to have deserted them, their eyes are dull, and the whole\r\nanimal seems weary and languid. At a more advanced stage the wool\r\nacquires a bluish tinge, the blood becomes thick, diminishing in\r\nquantity, and the muscles assume a pale and bloodless appearance. The\r\nbowels are constipated, and to this the feverish symptoms apparently\r\nowe their origin. If the disease progress, death will ensue in about a\r\nmonth.[28]\r\n\r\n        [28] A gradual wasting of the animal, similar to what occurs in\r\n        pining, may result from the irritation consequent on swallowing\r\n        pointed bodies, as pins or needles. I have in my possession a\r\n        very stout needle, given me by Mr Wilkin of Tinwald Downs,\r\n        which was found buried in the coats of the stomach of a young\r\n        sheep which died under the above symptoms, having been ill\r\n        about three months.\r\n\r\n(131.) _Treatment and Prevention._ The first object is to obtain a free\r\ndischarge from the bowels by means of purgatives, as, whenever a flux\r\nappears, the animal is safe. Two ounces of Castor oil given in a gruel,\r\nor the same quantity of Epsom salts, will do, care being taken that the\r\npurging be carried to some length.\r\n\r\nRemoval to a rich pasture is the only preventive. That pasture should\r\nbe preferred which contains a good proportion of bitter plants, for the\r\nemaciation appears to be owing in a considerable degree to torpor of\r\nthe bowels occasioned by long abstinence from these necessaries.\r\n\r\n(132.) _Staggers._ The symptoms nearly resemble those of sturdy, which\r\nI have afterwards to describe, and with which indeed I might have\r\nclassed it, were it not that it appears to be merely the result of a\r\npoisonous plant being taken into the stomach. It is rarely seen\r\nhereabouts; I shall, therefore, quote the account of it presented to\r\nthe Highland Society by Mr Stevenson:--\"This is a disease seldom or\r\nnever affecting the sheep in this country, those excepted which feed in\r\nforests, or amongst planting. The symptoms of it are more violent than\r\nthose of sturdy, during the time of their continuance. The animal,\r\nafter staggering for some time, falls on the ground, when a general\r\ntrembling comes on over the limbs; they are violently convulsed, and\r\nquite insensible to every thing. During the continuance of the paroxysm\r\nthey throw the body into various positions, and sometimes roll to a\r\nconsiderable distance. The fit continues for a quarter, sometimes half\r\nan hour, or an hour. When they rise, they seem perfectly bewildered,\r\ntill they regain the flock, when they continue to feed well, till\r\nanother paroxysm supervenes. This disease appears in Autumn, and\r\nvarious causes are said to produce it. Improper food, the leaves of the\r\noak, from their astringent quality, cobwebs sprinkled with dew, have\r\nall been reckoned as causes. I am inclined, however, to suppose, that\r\nit arises from the action of a poisonous grass (_Lolium temulentum_),\r\nwhich is the only one of that description in this country, and grows\r\nonly in those situations where staggers prevail. What effect these\r\ncauses have on the brain to produce this disease, I cannot explain.\r\nWhen it continues for any time on the same individual, it is apt to be\r\nfatal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Change of pasture is the only effectual cure for it.\"\r\n\r\n(133.) _Diarrhoea._ By this is meant a constant purging, affecting the\r\nyounger portions of the flock between April and June, leading to great\r\nemaciation, and proceeding from one of the following causes.\r\n\r\n    1st. Eating a soft tathy pasture, particularly if fouled by the\r\n    inundations of the previous winter.\r\n\r\n    2d. Feeding on too rich a pasture, or a sudden change from an\r\n    herbage deficient in nutritive qualities, to one that is much\r\n    superior.\r\n\r\n    3d. Transitions from heat to cold.\r\n\r\n    4th. Weakness and relaxation of the bowels.\r\n\r\n(134.) _Treatment of Diarrhoea._ When either of the first two causes\r\nhas given rise to purging, a moderate allowance of good hay will\r\ngradually stop it. This may be discontinued when the sheep has _taken_\r\nwith its altered fare.\r\n\r\nWhen diarrhoea has been occasioned by exposure to damp, or sudden\r\ntransitions from heat to cold, it may be arrested by keeping the animal\r\nin a house for a few days, and feeding it on any dry aliment, but when\r\ncrude trashy matter has been swallowed, and keeps up irritation by its\r\npresence, medicine must be resorted to. Administer an ounce of castor\r\noil in gruel, adding twenty drops of Laudanum if there has been\r\nstraining or evidences of pain. When the bowels have been _thoroughly\r\ncleared_ by this cathartic, it will be proper, if the discharge still\r\ncontinue, to check it by astringents. The medicine found by experience\r\nto answer best, is prepared as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Take of Logwood four ounces,\r\n            Extract of Catechu (Japan earth) one drachm,\r\n            Cinnamon two drachms,\r\n            Water three English pints.\r\n\r\nBoil for a quarter of an hour, strain, and then add sixty drops of\r\nLaudanum. Administer half an English pint of this night and morning so\r\nlong as the flux continues.\r\n\r\nDiarrhoea seldom proves fatal, and is indeed an easily managed disease;\r\nbut as it is frequently only a symptom of some other affection, or a\r\ncritical effort of the constitution to ward off some more serious\r\nmischief, the attempts at stopping it should always be cautiously\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\n(135.) _Dysentery.--Symptoms._ The pulse is quick and the respirations\r\nhurried. The skin is harsh and hot, and the wool in general clapped.\r\nThe mouth is dry, the eyes red and languid, and the ears drooping. Food\r\nis taken only in small quantities and rumination is stopped. The\r\ndischarges from the bowels are frequent, slimy, sometimes green, and a\r\nlittle further on in the disease are mixed with blood. The belly is\r\ndrawn towards the back. It is knotted and lumpy to the touch and a\r\nrumbling noise (_borborygmus_) is heard within it. As a careless\r\nobserver might have some difficulty in distinguishing dysentery from\r\ndiarrhoea the following diagnostic summary, drawn up by Professor\r\nDuncan, will be found of service.\r\n\r\n    1. Diarrhoea attacks chiefly hogs and weak gimmers and dinmonts;\r\n    whereas dysentery is frequent among older sheep.\r\n\r\n    2. Diarrhoea almost always occurs in the spring, and ceases about\r\n    June, when dysentery only commences.\r\n\r\n    3. In diarrhoea there is no fever or tenesmus, or pain before the\r\n    stools, as in dysentery.\r\n\r\n    4. In diarrhoea the faeces are loose, but in other respects natural,\r\n    without any blood or slime; whereas in dysentery, the faeces\r\n    consists of hard lumps passed occasionally without any blood or\r\n    slime.\r\n\r\n    5. There is not that degree of foetor in the faeces in diarrhoea\r\n    which takes place in dysentery.\r\n\r\n    6. In dysentery, the appetite is totally gone, in diarrhoea it is\r\n    rather sharper than usual.\r\n\r\n    7. In dysentery, the animal wastes rapidly, but by diarrhoea only a\r\n    temporary stop is put to its thriving, after which it makes rapid\r\n    advances to strength, vigour and proportion.\r\n\r\nIf dysentery continue to advance it will terminate fatally within a\r\nfortnight. Death is generally preceded by the \"_black scour_,\" which is\r\nonly an aggravation of the purging, the stools being mixed with shreds\r\nof dark gangrenous matter from the decomposed interior of the\r\nintestines.\r\n\r\n(136.) _Causes of Dysentery._ Many absurd opinions have gone abroad\r\nregarding the contagious nature of this affection. Contagion, however,\r\nhas nothing to do with the matter, the spread of the disease depending\r\nentirely on the state of the atmosphere and the nature of the locality.\r\nWhen dysentery occurs the weather is usually sultry, the ground upon\r\nwhich the flock has been going, foul, and the management of the sheep\r\nso improper, as to be sufficient of itself to produce the disease very\r\ngenerally. There is in fact only one proof of a disease being\r\ninfectious, viz., its immediate occurrence on the introduction of an\r\naffected animal among such as are in good health, on sound food, and in\r\neasy circumstances. This proof, however, in regard to dysentery has\r\nnever been established, and no medical person will now affirm that it\r\nis contagious. Some think that it travels from flock to flock in the\r\ndirection of the wind, but its appearing simultaneously in many folds\r\nought rather to be charged to the fact of the predisposing causes being\r\nnearly similar in all.\r\n\r\n(137.) _Treatment of Dysentery._ Bleed freely if the disease has\r\ncontinued only for a few days, but moderately if a longer time has\r\nunfortunately elapsed. Stoving, by which is meant shutting the animal\r\nin a wash-house, and allowing the apartment to become filled with\r\nsteam, though urged by some writers, cannot here be recommended. The\r\nintended object is the promotion of perspiration, by exciting the\r\naction of the skin, but this may be brought about by means much more\r\nconducive to the safety of the animal. After the bleeding immerse the\r\nsheep in a tub of hot water, and retain it there for twenty minutes;\r\nthen administer an ounce of Castor oil, with thirty drops of Laudanum,\r\nand cover the sheep up in a snug corner. After the oil has operated,\r\nthin well-boiled flour-porridge, given at intervals, in small\r\nquantities, will help to defend the ulcerated bowels, sooth the pain,\r\nand stop the purging. If these fail, you may use the astringent mixture\r\nrecommended in diarrhoea at page 175, and in the same manner, adding to\r\neach dose a grain of ipecacuanha. When the appetite returns, and the\r\nstools begin to acquire consistency, speedy recovery may be\r\nprognosticated.\r\n\r\nDuring recovery part of the wool always falls off.\r\n\r\n(138.) _Prevention of Dysentery._ If you wish your sheep to take the\r\ndisease, do as some wiseacres recommend--put tar upon their tails, and\r\nnoses; you will thus render them feverish, and uncomfortable, and every\r\nway fit for an attack.\r\n\r\nGathering sheep into confined places is always bad, nothing will tend\r\nmore to ward off dysentery than an open frequently-changed easy-lying\r\npasture, combined with gentle usage on the part of the shepherd.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\n(139.) _Scab, or Itch._--_Symptoms and Causes._ These are so well known\r\nthat they hardly merit a description. Little white specks appear upon\r\nthe wool, and are soon followed by a small pustule at the root. The\r\npustules are produced by a minute insect burrowing in the skin, which\r\naccounts for one external application of any active substance being\r\nsufficient to eradicate the malady. The infected sheep is restless,\r\ntearing off the wool with its teeth, and rubbing itself against every\r\nresisting body. The skin is red and fretted, discharging an ichor which\r\nhardens into crusts. These gradually extend, inducing a premature\r\nfailure of the wool.\r\n\r\nIf the sheep be not relieved, it sinks under its accumulated miseries.\r\n\r\nScab was little known any where, but in the Highlands, and the south of\r\nEngland, till the good old custom of smearing with tar and butter gave\r\nway before the elegant modern innovations. Into flocks anointed in the\r\nold manner it may be carried by infection, but will seldom or never\r\narise spontaneously among them.\r\n\r\nIt usually commences in spring among hogs, making its first appearance\r\namong the rams, especially those of the fine-woolled breeds, and is\r\nsupposed to be induced by overheating, want, or even excess of\r\nnutriment, or pasturing on wet lands in rainy seasons.\r\n\r\n(140.) _Treatment of Itch._ Subject the flock to a minute examination\r\nwhenever the movements of any animal excite suspicion, and remove every\r\none that is in the least affected. Place them in a separate enclosure,\r\nand apply either of the following recipes.\r\n\r\n    Take of Mercurial Ointment four pounds,\r\n            Venice Turpentine half a pound,\r\n            Oil of Turpentine one pint:\r\n\r\nmix thoroughly.\r\n\r\nSeparate the wool from the head to the tail and draw the fore finger\r\nloaded with a portion of the ointment, along the bottom of the groove.\r\nThen make lines from the middle of the back down each leg and score\r\nthem in the same manner, thus concluding the operation. Some farmers\r\nprefer rubbing the size of a walnut of the ointment into the delicate\r\nskin inside the thigh. The former plan is, however, the better of the\r\ntwo, and is the one recommended by Sir Joseph Banks, who communicated\r\nthe recipe to the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures,\r\nand Commerce, in the 7th volume of whose transactions it was published.\r\n\r\nA most important benefit to be derived from the application of the\r\nmercurial ointment, is the security it affords the sheep from the\r\nattack of the sheep fag or ked (_Hippobosca ovina_). The wool of sheep\r\nannoyed by this fly always contains joints or knots, owing to the\r\noccasional stoppage of its growth consequent on the fretting of the\r\nirritated animal. On this account dealers in wool are said to give a\r\nhigher price for fleeces having the mercurial tinge, as they are\r\nsupposed to be sound in the pile from having been exempted from the\r\nfly.\r\n\r\nThe next prescription is one of very great efficacy where the disease\r\nhas reached the length of scabs, and has, with many variations, gone\r\nthe round of almost every agricultural publication. The form I prefer\r\nis one submitted to me by Mr Wilkin of Tinwald Downs, near Dumfries,\r\nwho at one time, several years ago, applied it with immediate good\r\neffects, to six hundred infected sheep.\r\n\r\n    Take of Tobacco scrapings one pound,\r\n            Strong decoction of Broom six gallons:\r\n\r\nboil for half an hour, and then add three English pints of spirit of\r\ntar.\r\n\r\nThis quantity is sufficient to cover two dozen of sheep. The scabs, if\r\nlarge, should be raised a little with a knife to permit the free\r\ncontact of the fluid, and no more of it should be applied than is here\r\ndirected; for though it be in this dose comparatively harmless, a very\r\nsmall addition will destroy the animal.\r\n\r\nA very good French remedy is made by melting a pound of fat or suet,\r\nand mixing with it (when off the fire) a fourth part of oil of\r\nturpentine. Rub it into the affected parts.\r\n\r\nWhatever outward means may be employed, laxative medicines ought never\r\nto be neglected. One of the best and most generally used, consists of a\r\ntea-spoonful of flour of sulphur, given for two or three successive\r\nnights in double the quantity of molasses.\r\n\r\nIf ill-conditioned sheep are the victims of itch, convey them to a\r\nbetter pasture, but where the animals are fat, reduce their diet, and\r\ngive each a dose of Epsom salts.\r\n\r\n(141.) _Prevention of Itch._ Do not turn a healthy flock on to pasture,\r\nfrom which itchy sheep have recently been driven. If the disease\r\noccasionally breaks out on your ground, apply the mercurial ointment at\r\nclipping time: and, when you salve, add a pound of sulphur to every tub\r\nof smearing composition whatever it may be.\r\n\r\n(142.) _Erysipelas or wild-fire._ This is an inflammatory affection of\r\nthe skin, sometimes accompanied by blebs or blisters, occurring in\r\nAugust and September, and spreading rapidly through a flock. Though\r\nthere is considerable ambiguity in the employment of these terms, I\r\nbelieve they are synonymous with red-water, the disease of which I have\r\nnext to treat.\r\n\r\n(143.) _Red-water._ The occurrence of this disease among sheep is very\r\nrare. Its nature and treatment are however allowed, by those who have\r\nseen it, to be admirably described by Mr Stevenson, in the 3d vol. of\r\nthe _Highland Society's Transactions_.\r\n\r\n\"This disease commonly makes its appearance about the beginning, or end\r\nof winter, and first affects about the breast and belly, although at\r\ntimes it spreads itself over other parts of the body. It consists in an\r\ninflammation of the skin, that raises it into blisters which contain a\r\nthin, reddish, and watery fluid. These continue for a short time,\r\nbreak, discharge their matter, and are followed by a blackish scab.\r\nWhen the sheep are exposed to cold or wetness, the skin being fretted\r\nmakes the blisters rise, or they often arise from cold, affecting the\r\nanimal internally, thus producing a slight fever, which throws out\r\nthese vesicles on the body, similar to the scabby eruptions, which\r\nappear about the face, and more particularly the mouth of those persons\r\naffected with cold. The blood in this disease is but little affected,\r\nthough a little of it oozes into the vesicles on the skin, and\r\ncommunicates to them that reddish tinge, which gives origin to the\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\"Red-water is a disease that but seldom appears in this country, and is\r\nalmost never fatal. In cases where the disease is violent, a little\r\nblood should be taken. * * * * The sheep should be placed in a fold by\r\nitself, * * * * and the following medicine may be given for three or\r\nfour mornings successively:--\r\n\r\n    Take of Flour of Sulphur two ounces,\r\n            Molasses three ounces:\r\n\r\nmix them, and divide them into six doses, of which one may be given\r\nevery morning, in half a pound (half a mutchkin) of warm water. If this\r\nis found unsuccessful, half an ounce of nitre, mixed with the foregoing\r\nrecipe, will be attended with good effects; after which, a dose of\r\nsalts may be given, and the body washed with lime-water upon the part\r\naffected.\"\r\n\r\n(144.) _Leg Evil._--_Symptoms and Causes._ Like many other diseases,\r\nthis is usually supposed to be contagious, merely because it often\r\nspreads quickly through a flock; the obvious fact of the exposure of\r\nthe animals composing it to the same causes, such as peculiar diet and\r\natmospheric variations, being entirely overlooked; but, as I have\r\nalready remarked in paragraph (136), the only proof of a disease being\r\ncontagious, is its spreading rapidly on the introduction, from a\r\ndistance, of an infected individual into a previously-healthy flock.\r\n\r\nSheep which acquire fat at an early age, are peculiarly liable to this\r\ndisease: a sufficient argument, if all others were wanting, against the\r\nunnatural and foolish practice of accumulating a load of grease on the\r\nbodies of young animals. By so doing, the action of the heart and lungs\r\nis materially embarrassed, and, on the animal being chilled, or the\r\nbalance of its circulation otherwise accidentally deranged,\r\nmortification (leg evil) is almost certain to occur. Even simple\r\nscratches are often fatal in these over-fat animals, from inducing\r\ngangrene.\r\n\r\nThe first intimation the shepherd has of the approach of leg evil, is\r\nthe occurrence of fever and lameness, accompanied by blue or livid\r\npatches on the leg, generally about the upper part of the hoof or knee.\r\nThe skin on the affected parts, in a few days, exhibits scattered\r\nvesicles, not unlike the blebs which form in erysipelas; it then gives\r\nway, and the parts beneath are seen of a darker tinge, soft, pulpy, and\r\ncompletely gangrenous.\r\n\r\nLeg evil may prove fatal in a few days, or not for several weeks, much\r\ndepending on the extent of the sloughing portions, which may include\r\nthe entire leg, or legs, or may be limited to a single patch.\r\n\r\n(145.) _Treatment of Leg Evil._ When the animal is in high condition,\r\nand the disease has arisen spontaneously, bleeding is the first thing\r\nto be thought of. It must, however, be conducted cautiously, it being\r\nbetter to use the lancet a second time, than, by withdrawing too much\r\nblood, to reduce the vital powers below the standard which is necessary\r\nfor replacing the gangrenous portions. Should a leg be affected to any\r\nextent, the sheep must be at once destroyed, as there is scarcely a\r\npossibility of its surviving, without a degree of care and nicety in\r\nthe treatment, which it is beyond the power of unprofessional persons\r\nto bestow. Where the livid spots are limited, rags dipped in spirit of\r\nturpentine, which has been heated by immersing the bottle containing it\r\nin hot water, may be laid upon the skin; but when dead portions have\r\nbegun to separate, the best application is either a warm poultice, made\r\nof carrots, which have been boiled and mashed, or one made of boiled\r\noatmeal, which has been fermented by adding to it a table-spoonful of\r\nyeast, and placing it for an hour before a fire. When the sore is\r\nbecoming clean, and the granulations are rising freely, pursue the\r\nmethods recommended in paragraph (110).\r\n\r\n(146.) _Prevention of Leg Evil._ Remove the diseased animals from the\r\nflock, and, in dressing their sores, never use a sponge, or any thing\r\nwhich, from its value, is apt to be preserved, and, perhaps, applied in\r\nno long time to the cuts or scratches of a healthy animal; for, though\r\nleg evil is not communicable by ordinary means, yet is it readily\r\nexcited by inoculation, or the application of putrid matter to a broken\r\nsurface. If the odour from the affected parts is any way offensive,\r\nwash them with, and sprinkle round the fold, either a weak solution of\r\n_chloride of lime_, or the disinfecting liquid of Labarraque, articles\r\nwhich may now be procured from every provincial apothecary. Finally,\r\nlet the shepherd _wash his hands carefully_ before going from diseased\r\nto healthy sheep, using, if need be, a little of either of these\r\nsolutions; and let him look well to any injuries which his charges may\r\nreceive in July, August, and September, for these are the months most\r\nfavourable to the occurrence of leg evil.\r\n\r\n(147). _Inflammation caused by Maggots._ The insects passing under the\r\nname of \"Fly,\" though most troublesome in August, attack the sheep from\r\nthe month of May to September, inclusive, depositing their eggs among\r\nthe wool, in general about the tail, the roots of the horns, or any\r\npart which affords, from its filthy appearance, a prospect of suitable\r\nprovision for the maggot. When these eggs are hatched, a process which\r\nis, in sultry weather, almost instantaneous, the maggot erodes the\r\nskin, and speedily brings the adjacent parts into a fit condition for\r\nthe reception of succeeding numbers of its species.\r\n\r\nThe backs of long-woolled sheep are, from their exposure, more liable\r\nto be selected by the flies, as a receptacle for their eggs, than the\r\ncorresponding parts in such as are covered by a short thick fleece.\r\n\r\nNo sooner has the maggot begun its operations, than the sheep becomes\r\nuneasy and restless, rubbing itself on stones and trees, and\r\nendeavouring, by every means in its power to free itself from the\r\nannoyance. Teazed by the constant irritation, fever soon sets in, and,\r\nif the sheep be unrelieved by the shepherd's aid, death ensues in\r\nfour-and-twenty hours.\r\n\r\nIt is only lately that attention has been paid to the history of the\r\ninsect pests which originate the mischief, so little damage do they\r\nappear to have occasioned in former periods. In a valuable paper,\r\ncontaining the result of observations made on this subject in the\r\nHighlands, and published in the second number of the _Quarterly Journal\r\nof Agriculture_, they are thus described:--\r\n\r\n\"The fly which is the immediate cause of this disease, seems, as far as\r\nmy observations could extend, to consist of four species, viz.--the\r\n_Musca Ceasar_, _Cadaverina_, _Vomitoria_, and _Carnaria_, of Linnaeus.\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\"_M. Ceasar_ is of a shining green colour.\r\n\r\n\"_M. Cadaverina_, the thorax shining bluish, the abdomen green, like\r\nthe _Ceasar_.\r\n\r\n\"_M. Vomitoria_, thorax black, or dark-blue grey, abdomen dark glossy\r\nblue. This is the common _Blue-Bottle_ or _Flesh-fly_.\r\n\r\n\"_M. Carnaria_, grey; the thorax has three black longitudinal markings\r\non the upper surface; the abdomen is checquered, in some positions\r\nshining whitish.\r\n\r\n\"In all those instances in which I observed them, the green flies were\r\nthe first to attack, and this is the common opinion among the\r\nshepherds. After a time, when the larvae (maggots) commenced gnawing the\r\nflesh, the putrid stench, which was thereby occasioned, attracted\r\nnumerous other species. The _Vomitoria_ (_blue-bottle_) was very\r\ncommon, more numerous than both the former species, and perhaps\r\ncontributed most to accelerate the death of the animal, after the\r\nothers had commenced. The _Carnaria_ was rare. I observed but few of\r\nthem, and these seemed not concerned; which is the more remarkable, as\r\nin the fenny counties of England it is said to be most troublesome. All\r\nthe species of this genus resemble one another closely, both in\r\nappearance and mode of life. They are exceedingly voracious, feeding\r\nupon carcasses and filth of every description. In five days after being\r\nhatched they arrive at full growth, provided they have plenty of food;\r\nthey then cease to eat, and seek to assume the pupa state, crawling\r\nunder ground two or three inches. Here they remain about fourteen days,\r\nwhen the shell cracks, and the imago, or fly, appears. In this last\r\nstate, they feed also on putrid juices, sucking them through their\r\nprobosces.\"\r\n\r\nThe correctness of this description of their transformations I can\r\nattest, from having watched their habits during my anatomical pursuits\r\nin the summer months.\r\n\r\n(148.) _Treatment of Fly-blown Sheep._ When the sheep is fly-blown,\r\ndislodge the maggots with a knife, and shake a little powdered white\r\nlead into the wound. Do not apply tar to the abraded surface, as, from\r\nits cauterizing effects, the wound will be enlarged, and a repetition\r\nof the visit speedily ensured. To ward off the onset of the flies,\r\nvarious substances noxious to them are rubbed or poured upon the wool.\r\nTar, in small quantities, and of pungent quality, is by some daubed\r\nupon the ears, horns, and tail. Others prefer rubbing a little melted\r\nbutter, thickened by flour of sulphur, along the sheep's back: this is\r\nan effectual preventive. Some, again, prefer dressing the sheep, when\r\nin low situations, with the following recipe, which I take the liberty\r\nof copying from Mr Mather's paper on the fly, in the _Quarterly Journal\r\nof Agriculture_, No. XXIV.\r\n\r\n    \"Take of Arsenic, finely pounded, one pound\r\n             Potash twelve ounces,\r\n             Common yellow soap six ounces,\r\n             Rain or river water thirty gallons.\r\n\r\n\"Boil the ingredients together for fifteen minutes. * * * * The liquid\r\nis in no degree injurious to wool. It cleans and dries the offensive\r\nperspiration of the sheep, and destroys the smell caused by the dew in\r\nthe mornings, or by damp hot weather. In most situations, one dressing\r\nin July and another in August will suffice; but as the expense is\r\ntrifling, and the process simple, it may be better to apply it more\r\nfrequently, especially in low and damp situations.\" The liquid is\r\napplied only in dry weather. A teapot, or any vessel of a similar form,\r\nis filled with it, and one person pours it on the wool, while another\r\nrubs the fleece to facilitate the passage of the fluid. At the times of\r\nusing the solution, all superfluous wool ought to be shorn from the\r\nbuttocks, but not too closely.\r\n\r\nWhen the insects are very troublesome, drive the sheep if possible to\r\nhigher ground. Examine carefully all wounds and ulcers, however\r\ntrifling, and dress them with any simple ointment containing a small\r\nproportion of sulphur, mercury, or white-lead. Lastly, bury all useless\r\ncarcasses as speedily as possible, by which means you will keep down\r\nthe number of the flies.\r\n\r\n(149.) _The Sheep-Fag or Ked_ (_Hippobosca ovina_) and _The Tick_\r\n(_Acarus reduvius_), are destroyed or stopped in their attacks by the\r\nsame remedies and preventives detailed in the preceding paragraphs on\r\nthe fly.\r\n\r\n(150.) _Inflammation produced by the OEstrus bovis._ This insect\r\ninfests not only cattle but also sheep and goats, depositing its eggs\r\non the back of the animal, where it forms a small tumour, in which the\r\nlarvae remain from autumn till the commencement of the ensuing summer.\r\nOnly the fattest and most vigorous animals are attacked, and the larvae\r\nare very difficult to destroy. Fischer found, from numerous\r\nexperiments, that even spirits, and a strong solution of salt, could\r\nnot affect them. The fumes of burning sulphur alone seemed to annoy\r\nthem, and to it they speedily fell victims. This, however, is a remedy\r\nwhich cannot be applied to the skin of the sheep, so that our only\r\nresource is the repeated application of turpentine to the tumours on\r\nthe back, taking care to slit them up so as to facilitate its action.\r\n\r\n(151.) _Sore Teats._ When a ewe is observed to hinder the lamb from\r\nsucking, its teats should be examined. If much inflamed, a poultice\r\nshould be applied, and the lamb placed under the charge of another\r\nnurse. Suppuration will thus be promoted, and the matter may be allowed\r\nto escape by making an opening for it at the place it points. If there\r\nis only a little tenderness of the skin, all that is required is the\r\nwashing it with a solution either of sugar of lead or sulphate of zinc,\r\neight grains to the ounce of water.\r\n\r\n(152.) _Foot-rot._ No disease occasions more acute suffering to the\r\nsheep, and annoyance to the farmer, than foot-rot, and no disease has\r\nled to longer arguments as to its contagious or non-contagious nature.\r\nThanks, however, to Mr Dick of Edinburgh, these disputes are closed for\r\never, as any one may be convinced, by perusing his clever and sarcastic\r\npaper at page 852, Vol. ii. of the _Quarterly Journal of Agriculture_.\r\nHis excellent remarks on the popular ideas of the infectious nature of\r\nfoot-rot, I have not space to quote, but shall lay before the reader\r\nhis views as to the situations and circumstances which give origin to\r\nthe disease.[29]\r\n\r\n        [29] To enable the reader more easily to understand Mr Dick's\r\n        views of this disease, I have added a drawing of the foot of\r\n        the sheep, which it may be well to consult before entering on\r\n        the subject.\r\n\r\n        _Fig. 4. Plate._ I. Section of a toe:--_c.c._ Crust of the\r\n        hoof; _s._ Sole; _g.g._ Gland which secretes the hoof.\r\n\r\n(153.) _Causes of Foot-rot._ \"What do we gain,\" says Mr Dick, \"by\r\nenticing the sheep from his native and natural haunts to the richer\r\npasturage of our meadows or lawns? There the animal enjoys a more\r\nluxuriant repast; it fattens to a larger size, and will, in this\r\nrespect, repay the increased allowance which has been made to it. But\r\ninstead of moving about in small troops, with the alacrity of the wild\r\nkinds, the sheep are seen in flocks of thousands, moving slowly over\r\ntheir pastures, and gorging themselves to an extent which cuts short\r\nthe thread of life, by the advancement of various diseases. Instead of\r\nwandering from the summit of one peak to another, in quest of a scanty\r\nsubsistence, or instead of being compelled to descend from the summits\r\nof the mountain in the morning, and ascend again in the evening, they\r\nare compelled, in many cases, to remain within a few yards of a\r\nparticular spot for weeks together, and there engorge themselves to\r\nsatiety.\r\n\r\n\"But what, it may be asked, has this to do with the foot-rot? More, I\r\nam inclined to think, than is generally imagined. The hoofs of the\r\nsheep being intended to receive a degree of friction from hard\r\nsurfaces, are not acted upon when the animal is placed under such\r\ncircumstances; and the necessary consequence is an overgrowth of the\r\nhoof. The crust,--the part naturally intended to support the weight of\r\nthe animal, and to endure the greatest share of fatigue,--is here\r\nallowed to grow out of all due bounds, because the softness of the\r\npasturages, upon which it now moves, presents little, if any, of that\r\nrough friction to which the feet of the animal is naturally intended to\r\nbe exposed. The crust, therefore, grows unrestrained, until it either\r\nlaps over the sole, like the loose sole of an old shoe, and serves to\r\nretain and accumulate earth and filth, or is broken off in detached\r\nparts, in some cases exposing the quick, or opening new pores, into\r\nwhich the particles of earth or sand force their way, until reaching\r\nthe quick, an inflammation is set up, which, in its progress, alters or\r\ndestroys the whole foot.\"\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The finest and richest old pastures and lawns are particularly liable\r\nto this disease; soft, marshy, and luxuriant meadows are equally so;\r\nand it is also found in light, soft or sandy districts. In the first of\r\nthese it is perhaps most prevalent in a moist season, and in the latter\r\nin a dry one; in short, it exists to a greater or less extent in every\r\nsituation which has a tendency to increase the growth of the hoofs\r\nwithout wearing them away, and more especially where they are kept soft\r\nby moisture. It is so prevalent in fine lawns and pleasure grounds,\r\nthat they are, in many instances, reduced in value to a mere trifle as\r\na pasture for sheep; they are said to be _infected_ with this disease,\r\nand having once become so, the vicissitudes of _seven_ seasons are\r\nscarcely sufficient to destroy the contagion! A luxuriant herbage, on\r\nsoft pastures, is equally subject to it; and, in both cases, the\r\ndisease is increased in a wet season.\r\n\r\n\"The reason why, in these situations, sheep are so liable to the\r\ndisease, is quite obvious. They are generally brought from lands where\r\ntheir range of pasturage was greater than in these situations. In their\r\nformer state, from the exercise which the animal took, and the nature\r\nof the grounds on which it pastured, the hoof was worn down as it grew;\r\nbut, under the state in question, the hoofs not only continue to grow,\r\nbut, where the land is moist, that growth is greatly increased; and the\r\nanimal does not tread upon hard ground, nor has it exercise to wear\r\nthem down. Now, in the case of man himself, when the nails of his\r\nfingers or toes exceed the proper length, they break, or give him such\r\nuneasiness as to induce him to pare them. And the same takes place with\r\nthe hoof of sheep. But there is this difference in the case of the\r\nlatter, that when their hoof once breaks, as the animal has not the\r\npower of paring it, the part thus broken must continue a wound. Some\r\nparts grow out of their natural and proper proportions; the crust of\r\nthe hoof (_c.c._) grows too long; and the overgrown parts either break\r\noff in irregular rents and unnatural forms, or, by over-shooting the\r\nsole (_s._), allow small particles of sand or earth to enter into the\r\npores of the hoof. These particles reach the quick, and set up an\r\ninflammation, which is followed by the destructive effects which are\r\ntoo well known to require description.\r\n\r\n\"Similar effects are produced on soft, wet grounds. The feet, in such a\r\nsituation, are not only not subject to a proper degree of friction to\r\nwear down the hoofs, but the growth of the hoofs is materially\r\nincreased by the soft and moist state in which they are kept. And this\r\nstate renders the feet the more liable to the disease, as it opens up\r\nthe pores of the horn, and allows the earth or sand to penetrate, and\r\nwound the quick, in the manner I have already stated. On soft sandy\r\nground, of a dry nature, the same circumstances may occur. The soft\r\nsand gives way by the weight of the animal, and the crust of the hoof\r\nis not worn down. The sand penetrates between the sole and the crust,\r\nas has been already explained, and produces inflammation. The disease,\r\nhowever, is not so common on sand as in the other situations to which I\r\nhave alluded, the sand seldom being found in such a loose state.\"\r\n\r\nAnother variety of foot-rot is produced by the friction of long grass\r\nbetween the hoofs, but is mostly confined to hill sheep, when first\r\npastured on lowland districts. These animals, from having been\r\naccustomed to collect their food on extensive ranges of bare pasture,\r\nare more exposed than heavy breeds to this frequent exciting cause of\r\nthe complaint. The rubbing of the grass frets the skin in the cleft of\r\nthe hoof, the gland in that situation swells, becomes enlarged, and\r\nsuppurates, and in no long time the animal is compelled to rest upon\r\nits knees.[30] This complaint is, however, more readily remedied than\r\nthe former, and does not cause nearly so much suffering to the sheep.\r\n\r\n        [30] _Fig. 5. Plate._ I. Gives a view of the inner surface of\r\n        the toe of a sheep, with the interdigital gland laid open.\r\n\r\n        _g._ The gland.\r\n\r\n        _d._ The duct of the gland, opening upon the anterior surface\r\n        of the leg.\r\n\r\n        When the interdigital gland is much enlarged, it becomes\r\n        necessary to cut it out. This ought to be a last resource, as\r\n        the part appears to be of too much importance to be easily\r\n        dispensed with.\r\n\r\n(154.) _Treatment and Prevention of Foot-rot._ As foot-rot, in nine\r\ncases out of ten, is an attempt on the part of nature to get rid of a\r\nportion of the hoof, which ought, in the proper course of things, to\r\nhave been worn away as fast as it appeared, the prevention and\r\ntreatment of the first stage of the complaint will naturally suggest\r\nthemselves. \"As this disease,\" says Mr Dick, at the conclusion of the\r\naforementioned paper, \"arises in consequence of the hoofs not being\r\nexposed to sufficient friction to wear them down, or keep them in their\r\nproper state, or where their natural growth is increased by the nature\r\nand moisture of the ground, the hoofs of all the flock should be\r\nregularly rasped or pared at short intervals, say from eight days to a\r\nfortnight, according to the rapidity with which a particular pasture\r\nproduces the disease. In certain situations, they might be made to\r\ntravel upon a hard surface, similar to natural sheep tracts, or be\r\nfolded in a place purposely prepared, upon which they could move about\r\nand wear their hoofs. For that purpose, they should be placed in it\r\nevery day.\"\r\n\r\nWhen foot-rot has fairly commenced, pare the hoof from the affected\r\npart, and trim away any ragged portions, wash the foot with soap and\r\nwater, and place the animal in a situation where as few irritating\r\nthings as possible will be in the way of the tender surface, and give a\r\npurgative. If not properly attended to, the suppuration soon terminates\r\nin mortification. Cleanliness in every stage and variety of foot-rot,\r\nis of the first importance. Many corrosive preparations are recommended\r\nfor the cure of this disease, but I have decided objections to one and\r\nall of them. When the foot is clean, endeavour, by frequent\r\napplications of soap and water, to keep and treat the ulcers as\r\ndirected in paragraph 110.\r\n\r\n(155.) _Inflammation produced by Insects in the Air Passages._ Much\r\nannoyance is caused to the sheep by the presence of animals in the air\r\npassages. The _OEstrus ovis_ deposits its eggs on the margin of the\r\nnostril in autumn; these are soon hatched, and the larvae immediately\r\nfind their way up the interior of the nose, till they arrive at the\r\nfrontal sinus, a cavity situated between the layers of the frontal\r\nbone, and of considerable size in the sheep. Here they remain till the\r\nfollowing spring, when they quit their hold, become winged insects, and\r\nenter upon the career of torment so ably gone through by their\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\nThe _Pentastoma_, an animal supposed at one time only to exist in the\r\nfrontal sinus and lungs, and on the surface of the liver, of the dog,\r\nwolf, and horse, as well as in some reptiles, has been discovered by an\r\nable naturalist, my friend Mr Rhind of Edinburgh, in the frontal sinus\r\nof the sheep. It spends its whole existence there, and is distinguished\r\nfrom other entozoa by having the mouth between two pores on each side,\r\nthrough which a spicular process comes out. Figure 3, Plate VII. is\r\ntaken from a drawing kindly furnished by Mr Rhind.\r\n\r\n(156.) _Removal of Insects from the Nostril._ The _OEstrus ovis_\r\noccasions much distress to the sheep at the moment of depositing its\r\neggs within the nostril. The animal on feeling the movements of the\r\nfly, rubs its nose against the ground, or, carrying it low, darts off\r\nat a rapid pace, vainly endeavouring to escape from its tormentor.\r\nDuring this period, a thin limpid fluid distils from the nostrils,\r\nleading a careless observer to confound the symptoms with those which\r\naccompany Coryza. In general the irritation is now terminated, as,\r\nwhile in the larvae state, the insects are incapable of offensive\r\nmeasures. If they are clustered in considerable numbers in the frontal\r\nsinuses, they will doubtless lead to great suffering, parallel to what\r\nis recorded to have followed the nestling of insects in the same\r\nsituation in the human being; and it is, therefore, advisable, when the\r\ncause of sturdy (paragraph 169) is in any way doubtful, first to apply\r\nthose substances to the nostril, which are calculated to destroy both\r\nthese larvae and the _pentastoma_, should they happen to be there.\r\nTobacco smoke is the only available remedy, and a very good one,\r\nbeing easily brought in contact with the worms, and, when properly\r\nadministered, certain in its effects. One person secures the sheep\r\nholding the head in a convenient position, while another, having half\r\nfilled a pipe with tobacco, and kindled it in the usual manner, places\r\none or two folds of a handkerchief over the opening of the bowl, then\r\npasses the tube a good way up the nostril, applies his mouth to the\r\ncovered bowl, and blows vigorously through the napkin. When this has\r\ncontinued for a few seconds, the pipe is withdrawn, and the operation\r\nrepeated on the other nostril.\r\n\r\nThe round hair-worm (_strongylus filaria_) has been found in great\r\nnumbers in the trachea and bronchii of calves by Camper, and of the\r\nsheep by Daubeuton. It has also been found in the reed and duodenum of\r\nthe latter animal by Rudolphi. Two other species of the genus\r\n_Strongle_, the _S. contortus_ and _S. filicollis_, have been detected\r\nin the sheep, the former in the belly, the latter in the small\r\nintestines. They all appear to originate only in such sheep as are\r\nexposed to the sapping influence of low damp situations, combined with\r\nstinted diet. Those occuring in the air tubes give rise to irritation,\r\nand a consequent harassing cough, which is only to be arrested by\r\nremoving the sheep to a dry airy locality, and a nutritious pasture.\r\nUnless portions of the worms are thrown up during coughing, they cannot\r\nbe pronounced with confidence to exist, as the symptoms which they\r\nproduce are very similar to those which accompany the two following\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n(157.) _Coryza._ During the winter months, this affection is of very\r\nfrequent occurence among sheep; but health is only in a few instances\r\nseriously affected. It is brought on by the exposure of the animal to\r\nintense cold, or to sudden chills, after it has been heated. In slight\r\ncases, the only annoyance to which the sheep is subjected, is from\r\nmatter accumulating in the nostril, and plugging up the orifice, so\r\nthat the poor creature is compelled to raise its head every three or\r\nfour minutes, and labour hard for breath.[31] When the inflammation\r\nextends further down the air tubes, the symptoms assume a severer type,\r\nand death soon occurs, in general from suffocation. If the inflammation\r\nof the bronchial tubes becomes chronic, that is to say, if it goes on\r\nin a mild form for a length of time, pulmonary consumption (rot) will\r\nin all probability succeed, and destroy the sheep in a more lingering\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n        [31] The sheep is more inconvenienced by Coryza than other\r\n        animals, owing to the naturally small calibre of the nostrils,\r\n        the inferior turbinated bone being of large dimensions, and\r\n        occupying the greater part of the nasal cavity. It is from this\r\n        peculiar formation of the nose, that sheep are so very easily\r\n        blown, when made to exert themselves in running.\r\n\r\n(158.) _Treatment of Coryza._ Should this disease prevail in a lenient\r\nform among your sheep, removal to a sheltered field, and a dose of\r\npurgative medicine, are all that is required. If, however, the feverish\r\nsymptoms are severe, besides giving a purgative, bleed at the outset of\r\nthe disease, and administer ten grains of the following fever powder,\r\ndissolved in a tea-cupful of warm water:--\r\n\r\n    Take of powdered Digitalis (Foxglove) half a drachm.\r\n            Tartarized Antimony fifteen grains\r\n            Nitre two drachms.\r\n\r\nRub them well together, and divide the mixture into fifteen parts or\r\npowders. Half an hour after the powder is swallowed, give the sheep a\r\nbasin of warm gruel, and repeat the powder at the end of six hours, if\r\nthe symptoms are not considerably abated. When the sheep is recovering,\r\nkeep it on juicy food, and do not expose it to inclement weather, as it\r\nwill be very liable to another and more severe attack. Those sheep\r\nwhich are subject to cough on slight changes of temperature, should\r\nalways be picked out, fattened for the market, and disposed of at the\r\nearliest opportunity, as they will, in all probability, sooner or\r\nlater, fall victims to the following disease.\r\n\r\n(159.) _Rot._ Every animal, from the serpent up to man, that is to say,\r\nevery animal possessed of lungs, is liable to _rot_. The inelegance of\r\nthe term might be overlooked, provided a precise meaning were attached\r\nto it. Every one, however, seems to place some peculiar signification,\r\nand to hang some favourite theory, upon it, so that little wonder need\r\nbe expressed either at the varying tenor of the treatment, or at the\r\nunsatisfactory conclusions which have been drawn regarding it. The word\r\n\"_rot_,\" when employed in speaking of man, implies what, in popular\r\nlanguage, is called \"_consumption_,\" and is applied to that disease\r\nonly when it affects the lungs. Thus the fork-grinders of Sheffield,\r\nwho, from the nature of their employment, are much exposed to the\r\nexciting causes of consumption, and who, at an early age, fall victims\r\nto it, are said, by the people of that town, to die of rot. The term,\r\nhowever, so far as it has yet been used in relation to the sheep, has\r\nfigured as the representative of a host of diseases, and, in becoming\r\nstandard from frequent usage, has only rendered confusion worse\r\nconfounded. \"_Rot_,\" says the late Professor Coventry, in his\r\n_Introductory Discourses_, \"is a word which has been employed to\r\nexpress a variety of disorders affecting this animal, with no small\r\nconfusion and detriment. Indeed, in few instances has senseless\r\nindiscrimination done more mischief; for means inapt and injurious have\r\nbeen had recourse to, where skilful and timely interference would have\r\nhad the happiest effects. Sheep are sometimes said to have the rot,\r\nwhen they labour under _phthisis pulmonalis_ (consumption of the\r\nlungs), which they do but rarely; or under disorders of the liver, as\r\n_hepatitis chronica_, and that state of the same organ produced, or\r\nattended by the _fasciolae hepaticae_ (fluke worms), _hydatides_, &c.,\r\nwhich affections of the liver are not unfrequent. But the most common\r\nrot is still another and very distinct disorder, resembling, in many\r\npoints, and probably the very same in its nature with, _scorbutus_\r\n(scurvy) in the human species, or that _miseranda lues_, that direful\r\nruin of the general health and constitution, which silently supervenes\r\nfrom deficient or depraved aliment; and from which, as numerous\r\nobservations testify, every flock, every sufferer, may be recovered by\r\nsimple means seasonably used; but against which, in its advanced stage,\r\nall remedies prove of no avail. Perhaps, as the last symptoms of\r\ndebility are very similar, and are most taken notice of by ordinary\r\nobservers, the different kinds of rot might conveniently enough pass\r\nunder the names of pulmonic, hepatic, and general rot.\"\r\n\r\nSetting aside, for the moment, the inaccuracy of part of the above\r\nobservations, I shall only remark, that, though Dr Coventry, in thus\r\ncalling attention to the conflicting state of opinions on the subject,\r\nhas accomplished much in reconciling discrepancies, he has still left\r\nsomething to be done in simplifying the matter; while he has, at the\r\nsame time, rendered that something difficult of execution, from his own\r\nhigh authority being associated with the blunder. The only way,\r\ntherefore, to remedy the thing, is to quit for the present the views of\r\nthat learned gentleman, while I endeavour to give a plain account of\r\nthe disease, its causes, and effects.\r\n\r\n(160.) _Symptoms of Rot._ The first thing which indicates the presence\r\nof the disease, is the unwillingness of the affected animal to move\r\nabout. It lags behind the flock, ascends a slope with difficulty, and\r\nhas a listless, heavy, pithless appearance. Cough varying in frequency\r\nand violence, but extremely harassing, is present at every period of\r\nthe disease, and is always increased on the slightest exertion.[32] At\r\nfirst this is accompanied by expectoration of the mucus of the air\r\ntubes; but in no long time purulent matter, indicative of more\r\nextensive inroads on the constitution, begins to be coughed up, and\r\ngoes on increasing in quantity and becoming worse in quality till the\r\ntermination of the disease. The wool becomes fine, white, thin, and\r\nbrittle in the pile, and is easily brought away in masses by the\r\nslightest pull. The appetite is, throughout the disease, voracious, and\r\nthough all the bad symptoms may be present, still the animal keeps up\r\nan appearance of plumpness. This, however, is hollow and deceitful, and\r\nthe rapid loss of flesh which immediately succeeds, shows with what\r\ninsidious certainty the malady has been progressing. Owing to the\r\nfalling off in flesh and in fat, the neck appears to have acquired\r\nadditional length, and the eyes to have sunk within the head. Sooner or\r\nlater the skin beneath the neck becomes distended with serous fluid,\r\nand from this the disease has acquired the name of _Poke_. The word,\r\nhowever, is far from applicable, as it might, with equal propriety,\r\nstand for any other disease attended with dropsical accumulations.\r\nViolent purging soon terminates the disease, death being generally\r\npreceded by the evacuation of a quantity of blackish matter.\r\n\r\n        [32] It is quite possible that a sheep may die of true\r\n        pulmonary consumption and yet have scarcely any cough.\r\n\r\n(161.) _Appearances on Dissection._ The first thing which strikes a\r\nperson on viewing the carcass of a sheep which has died of rot, is its\r\nleanness. In conducting the examination, the fell appears of a bluish\r\nwhite, the muscles are pale and wasted, and fat hardly to be met with.\r\nWhere it once existed, a tough yellow substance alone remains, which is\r\nso destitute of all pretentions to the name of suet, that it cannot,\r\neven when thrown upon a fire, be made to blaze. Dropsical accumulations\r\nare found in the legs, chest, neck, and belly. On opening the chest,\r\nthe lungs are often seen adhering at intervals to the lining membrane\r\nof the ribs, and have always a shrunk, diminutive appearance. These\r\nadhesions are frequently seen where there are no tubercles, and are in\r\nthat case simply the result of exposure to cold; but where they are\r\ncoincident with tubercles, they may be ascribed either to the animal\r\nhaving been exposed to cold, or to the inflammatory action set up by\r\nthe tubercles themselves. The lungs are always the principal, and I may\r\nalso, from my own experience, add, the primary seat of the affection.\r\nWhen examined in the early stage of rot, they have a hard lumpy feel,\r\nespecially at the upper part or lobe, and at this time a great number\r\nof irregular yellowish white, patchy-looking bodies (_Plate_ VI. _fig.\r\n2._), will be seen shining through the membrane, _pleura_, which\r\nsurrounds the organ. These _tubercles_, as the hard white bodies are\r\ncalled, vary in size from that of a mustard seed to that of a pea. They\r\nare sprinkled through all parts of the lung, and will in every\r\ndissection, be found in a variety of stages, from the firm condition in\r\nwhich they were deposited, to the softened state which denotes their\r\nspeedy expectoration. Each tubercle, however small, usually holds a\r\nparticle of calcareous matter in its centre. The lungs, in the advanced\r\nstage of rot, will be full of cells or caverns, owing to the\r\ndestruction of its texture by suppuration in those parts where\r\ntubercles existed. The cells or sacs are of all sizes, from that of a\r\nbean to that of a goose egg; but if the animal has been taken care of\r\nduring the progress of the complaint, and lingered long, the abscesses\r\nwill be so numerous, and so closely situated, as to give the remains of\r\nthe lung the appearance of a large bag. Extreme cases of this nature\r\nare, however, rare; as the sheep, in general, either falls before the\r\nknife, or is killed from exposure to cold long ere the disease has\r\nreached its farthest limit. These sacs contain purulent matter, of all\r\nshades and odours, and identical with that which the animal coughed up.\r\n\r\nTubercles, and all their concomitants as above detailed, are also met\r\nwith in the liver, though not so frequently as in the lungs. They\r\nconstantly occur in the _clyars_ (mesenteric or lacteal glands) which\r\non this account are much above their usual size, and are occasionally\r\nfound in other parts; but I need not proceed in their description, as\r\nsufficient has been said about them to enable the unprofessional reader\r\nto understand their relation to the complaints.\r\n\r\nFluke worms and hydatids are almost constant attendants on rot, and\r\nseemingly most important ones, especially the former, which have, I may\r\nsay, kept a great bulk of the learned and unlearned for many years in a\r\nperpetual bustle, and have so effectually hoodwinked writers on this\r\nsubject, as to prevent them seeing the truly important points in the\r\ndisease. For this reason, I hold them worthy of particular description;\r\nas it is only by becoming acquainted with their history and habits that\r\nwe can form correct ideas either of their mode of origin or of their\r\nsupposed ability to cause rot.\r\n\r\n(162.) _The Liver Fluke_ (_fasciola hepatica_ or _distoma hepaticum_,\r\n_Fig. 6._ _Plate_ I.) derives its name from the resemblance it bears to\r\nthe plaice or flounder, though its shape has been more aptly compared\r\nto that of a melon seed. It is flat and oval, of a brownish-yellow\r\ncolour, and varies in size from that of a pin-head to one inch in\r\nlength, and half an inch in breadth. Each worm is bisexual or\r\nhermaphrodite, on which account they multiply with great rapidity. The\r\ngeneric name--_distoma_--signifies having two pores, _a.b. Fig. 6,\r\nPlate_ I., and is for this reason applied to it. The nipple-like body\r\nat the extremity _a._ contains the orifice of the pore or opening\r\nleading to the female division of the generative apparatus, situated\r\nbetween _a._ and _b._ In this cavity are formed the eggs, which are at\r\nintervals protruded, to be hatched when floating in the sheep's bile.\r\nThe male organ is situated in front of the ventral pore. The anterior\r\nopening _b._ is equivalent to a mouth, and leads inwards and backwards,\r\ncommunicating with the intestinal canals _c._, which are easily made\r\nout in the recent animal, from their containing dark bile, and which,\r\nas in other creatures low in the scale of being, serve the double\r\npurpose of a digestive and circulatory apparatus; that is to say, the\r\nstomach first prepares a fluid which is equivalent to blood, and then\r\ndistributes it throughout the body.[33]\r\n\r\n        [33] The examination of fluke worms is much facilitated by\r\n        placing several of various sizes flat upon a slip of glass, and\r\n        allowing them to dry in this position. On holding the glass\r\n        between a bright light and a lens, and looking through the\r\n        latter, the distribution of the vessels, and the position and\r\n        form of the eggs, are beautifully displayed.\r\n\r\nFlukes are never found in the _arteries_ of the liver, as has been\r\nerroneously stated by some writers, their abode being limited to the\r\ngall bladder and its ducts. In these they are often present in such\r\nnumbers as to cause great distention of the sac and tubes, and in some\r\ninstances the irritation produced by them leads to the thickening of\r\nthe walls of the gall bladder, and to a deposition of calcareous matter\r\nbetween its coats; frequently also to complete obliteration of portions\r\nof the ducts. Hence the crackling sound sometimes perceived when\r\nhandling the liver of a rotten sheep.\r\n\r\n(163.) _The Hydatid or Blob_ (_Cysticercus tumicollis_, _Fig. 1._\r\n_Plate_ VII.) so frequently found in sheep, is in form one of the\r\nsimplest of the entozoa (literally dwellers within), being little more\r\nthan a bag containing a quantity of fluid. As relates to outline, this\r\nhydatid bears no small resemblance to a Florence flask. It is said to\r\nhave a head, _h._--a neck, _n._--a body, _b._-- and a posterior or\r\ncaudal vesicle, _c.v._ Its claims to the title of an animal have been\r\nmuch disputed, but as it has been seen to move spontaneously, and as\r\nthe contained fluid is always essentially different from that by which\r\nthe hydatid is surrounded, the question may be looked upon as set at\r\nrest.[34]\r\n\r\n        [34] The property of acting on organized matter, so as to\r\n        convert it into substances similar to those which constitute\r\n        the agent, is characteristic of a vital power.\r\n\r\nThe method of their reproduction is in unison with their structure,\r\nsimple in the extreme. Nothing, however, very precise is known about\r\nthe process. The vesicle which acts as heart and stomach serves also as\r\nthe reproductive cavity, but how or by what means it is fecundated\r\nwould be difficult to determine. The young hydatids are found adhering\r\nto the inner surface of the parent cavity. When they have attained\r\nmaturity, the parent dies and shrivels, and the young ones begin to\r\neliminate their nourishment from the juices of the quadruped which they\r\ninfest.\r\n\r\nThese entozoa are found in general on the surface of the intestines,\r\nbetween them and their outer membrane (_peritoneum_), and on the\r\nexterior of the lungs and liver. They are always included in a cyst, to\r\nthe inner surface of which they adhere by means of two hook-shaped\r\nprocesses projecting from the head. These cysts are always on the\r\nsurface of the different viscera of the sheep, and in this way may be\r\ndistinguished from another sacular animal, or rather supposed animal,\r\ntermed acephalocyst or headless bag, which is sometimes found in\r\nclusters in the substance of the lungs, liver, &c. and is often\r\nconfounded with the true hydatid.\r\n\r\n(164.) _Causes of Rot._ If any one had been asked, thirty years ago,\r\nthe cause or rather causes of the appearances which pass under the name\r\nof rot, he could not have enumerated them even in a day, for at that\r\ntime each symptom was a disease, and as such was reckoned worthy of a\r\nseparate and proximate cause. Nor could any person have had the courage\r\nto promulgate a common-sense opinion on the subject; for simple views\r\nregarding the diseases of domestic animals were then either not deemed\r\nworthy of a moment's notice, or, if considered, were swept at once, by\r\nthe strong current of prejudice, into the foul ocean of predetermined\r\ndisapproval. Opinions in cattle medicine were at that time valued\r\naccording to the prolixity of their detail; and the more improbable the\r\ndependence of the effects upon the cause assigned, so much more was its\r\ndiscoverer lauded, and in like proportion was the chimerical fabric he\r\nhad raised admired. Times are, however, now happily changed; that\r\npotent oculist, the march of intellect, has cleared the film from the\r\npublic eye, and no one need, at present, be afraid to state the\r\nunaspiring fact, that _tubercles_ are the sole and proximate cause of\r\nthe disease called rot.\r\n\r\nThe observations of the late Dr Coventry, already quoted, would lead us\r\nto suppose that tubercles are of rare occurrence in the lungs of sheep,\r\nbut in refutation of this assertion, I need only request the reader to\r\ntake a ramble through a butcher-market, and he will perceive, even on\r\ncursory inspection, the fallacy of this conclusion. What the state of\r\nthe liver is which is attended with flukes and hydatids, he has left us\r\nto make out. Chronic hepatitis, which accompanies tubercles in the\r\nliver, goes for nothing as a disease of sheep, and therefore does not\r\nrequire a notice; besides, it is not rot, and is quite incompetent of\r\nitself to cause it. As for the scurvy of which he speaks, he evidently\r\nmeans the disease now generally known by the name of _Pining_, but\r\nwhich, as it has no connexion with rot, and has only become prevalent\r\nwithin the last sixteen years, could not be very well known to him.\r\n\r\nThe following questions will naturally occur to many of my readers.\r\nWhat gives rise to these tubercles? what are the predisposing causes\r\nwhich lead to their formation? and, when formed, how do these\r\napparently unirritating bodies produce effects so baneful? Queries like\r\nthese, however, cannot shortly be replied to, leading, as they do, to\r\ndiscussions which embrace many curious theories; but as the negative\r\nmode of teaching is often of avail where the positive or more direct\r\nwould fail to bring conviction, I shall, before proceeding to allude to\r\nwhat the causes are, endeavour to state what they are not.\r\n\r\n_Imaginary Causes of Rot._ The liver-fluke has long been looked upon as\r\nthe origin of rot, and this opinion has now become so deeply rooted,\r\nand taken so fast a hold of the public mind, that if I were to\r\ncontradict it by plain assertion, I should only be striving to buffet\r\nsingly a tide of opposition. The best way, therefore, will be to\r\nexamine a few of the theories supposed to be confirmatory of the notion\r\nthat fluke worms are the beginning of the mischief, and then see\r\nwhether their supporters have managed to make good the point.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I. The fluke is supposed to get into the liver of the sheep by\r\n    being swallowed, and this, according to our theorists, may be\r\n    brought about in some of the following ways:--\r\n\r\n      1. The eggs may be floating in the air, and thus accidentally\r\n      reach their destination. This is the view taken by the celebrated\r\n      Clater; but if he had been, in this instance, a man of\r\n      experiment, rather than of idle conjecture, he would have found,\r\n      as any one readily may, that the eggs of the fluke worm sink in\r\n      water, and, consequently, that they cannot float in air.[35]\r\n\r\n        [35] To obtain the eggs of the fluke worm for examination, hold\r\n        a saucer under the gall bladder, make an opening in it with\r\n        scissors, and the bile containing the eggs will flow into the\r\n        dish. Pick out any fluke worms that may be in the fluid, then\r\n        dilute it with about twelve times its bulk of water, agitate\r\n        for a few minutes, and filter. The eggs will be found in the\r\n        corner of the filtering paper.\r\n\r\n      2. The Rev. Dr Singer, to whom Scotland at large, and\r\n      Dumfries-shire in particular, is much indebted for numerous and\r\n      valuable papers on agricultural subjects, states, in the third\r\n      volume of the _Highland Society's Transactions_, page 478, that\r\n      \"The spawn or eggs of the liver fluke are most probably _conveyed\r\n      upon the grass_ by summer watering, and afterwards taken into the\r\n      stomach with it.\" A few lines further on, he speaks of the eggs\r\n      being \"wafted thither by harvest waterings.\" Now, as the fluke is\r\n      only produced within the sheep, I need only put the unanswerable\r\n      questions--How are they conveyed to the grass? and from whence\r\n      are they wafted? to refute at once this hasty notion.\r\n\r\n      3. The eggs may be voided by the sheep, may fall upon the\r\n      herbage, and there remain till they are eaten. Such is the\r\n      supposition published by Mr King of Hammersmith, in the\r\n      _Quarterly Journal of Agriculture_, No. XXXI. p. 331, in which,\r\n      after showing the vast number of eggs which must fall upon the\r\n      grass, he says, \"We must cease to wonder that so many sheep die\r\n      of rot; the miracle is, that every sheep does not die of it.\"! I\r\n      cannot, however, for my part, see a miracle in the matter, for\r\n      the simple reason, that the eggs of the entozoa are not capable\r\n      of retaining their vitality when absent even for a very short\r\n      time from the place of their nativity, and therefore may be eaten\r\n      with impunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n    II. Supposing the eggs to have reached the sheep's stomach in a\r\n    condition to allow of their being hatched, they, according to\r\n    popular voice, find their way into the gall bladder by one of two\r\n    routes.\r\n\r\n      1. Mr King, the gentleman above spoken of, conjectures, in the\r\n      same paper, that the fluke, after leaving the egg in the stomach\r\n      of the sheep, _makes its way up the gall vessels_. This is, I am\r\n      sorry to say, a very idle conjecture, as, from the valvular\r\n      nature of the opening of the gall duct into the duodenum, an\r\n      entrance from that intestine to the gall bladder is perfectly\r\n      impracticable to any of the entozoa.[36]\r\n\r\n        [36] The notion that rot is occasioned by animalcules getting\r\n        into the liver is not confined to this country. Leake, in his\r\n        travels in the Morea, alludes to an opinion prevalent there,\r\n        that the _vidhela_ (rot) is caused by the sheep feeding in\r\n        marshy places in August and September, when it is imagined that\r\n        an insect from the plants finds its way into the biliary\r\n        vessels.\r\n\r\n      2. The eggs are believed by a writer in the _Letters of the Bath\r\n      Society of Agriculture_, for 1781, to be taken into the blood\r\n      along with the chyle from the small intestines, and to be\r\n      arrested in the liver by the secretory ducts. This, it must be\r\n      clear to every one, is the most absurd of all the notions; for if\r\n      a globule of blood, which we must suppose to be the largest body\r\n      capable of being absorbed from the intestine, is only about\r\n      1/3000 of an inch in diameter, how can the egg of a fluke worm\r\n      pass through the same channel, when Mr King has, by careful\r\n      observation, shown it to be 1/300 an inch in its shortest\r\n      measurement. Again, allowing that they are taken into the blood,\r\n      would they not frequently be hatched there, and would they not\r\n      also be found in other quarters besides the liver. But do we ever\r\n      find them in the blood? Do we ever see them in other organs?\r\n      Certainly not.\r\n\r\n      Not one of these theories would ever have been broached had their\r\n      authors been aware of two important circumstances. 1. That M.\r\n      Schreiber, the director of the Museum at Vienna, has proved that\r\n      worms and their ova are not capable, under ordinary\r\n      circumstances, of resisting the action of the digestive organs,\r\n      and, therefore, that they cannot be introduced into the body by\r\n      this channel. \"During six months, he fed a pole-cat almost\r\n      exclusively on various kinds of intestinal worms, and their eggs\r\n      mixed up with milk; and on killing and examining it, at the end\r\n      of this period, not a single worm of any kind was found in\r\n      it.\"[37] The reader may perhaps object to this illustration, on\r\n      the ground that there is so vast a difference between a sheep and\r\n      a pole-cat, that a comparison in regard to their digestive habits\r\n      cannot possibly hold good, but if he will turn to paragraph (96),\r\n      he will see that the stomach of a sheep is as well fitted as that\r\n      of a carnivorous quadruped for the digestion of animal matters.\r\n      2dly, the fluke worm has been found by Frommen in the foetus of\r\n      the sheep, into which it could not have been conveyed by\r\n      transmission from the mother, as there is no direct vascular\r\n      communication between the foetal and maternal side.\r\n\r\n        [37] Cyclopedia of Practical Medicine, Vol. iv. p. 524.\r\n\r\n      From a consideration of all these data, the conclusion must at\r\n      once be drawn, that as living flukes cannot reach the liver from\r\n      without, they must of a necessity be produced only in particular\r\n      states of the animal they inhabit. How they originate we cannot\r\n      of course determine, and this is not the place to hazard\r\n      physiological conjectures; but it will be found that their\r\n      appearance in the bile is always preceded by tuberculous deposits\r\n      in the lungs or liver. This I have proved by numerous\r\n      dissections, in which I have occasionally found tubercles without\r\n      flukes, but never met with flukes where I did not at the same\r\n      time discover tubercles. Fluke worms, therefore, can never be\r\n      regarded as a cause of rot, they must be looked upon merely as a\r\n      symptom. We cannot, however, say that tubercles give rise to the\r\n      liver-fluke, for tubercles are often present in cases where\r\n      flukes are absent; and if the latter were the effect of the\r\n      former, their presence under such circumstances would in all\r\n      probability be constant.\r\n\r\n\r\n    III. Particular plants have been said to cause rot, but the proofs\r\n    of their evil tendencies being in every instance about as logically\r\n    supported as the fluke theories already mentioned, I need not\r\n    trouble myself or the reader by proceeding to details.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Real Causes of Rot._ Everything that has a tendency to weaken the\r\nanimal, will be more or less liable to lead to rot. Exposure to cold\r\nand wet, mishaps at lambing time, food bad in quality or deficient in\r\nquantity, and over-driving, will all predispose the constitution to the\r\ndeposition of tubercles. It is from the causes being in this way common\r\nto the whole flock, that contagious properties have been ascribed to\r\nrot, it having been observed, from the time of Virgil, to break out in\r\nmany animals at once.[38]\r\n\r\n        [38]\r\n\r\n        \"Nor oftener are the floods disturb'd with wind\r\n        Than sheep with rots; nor doth the sickness find\r\n        One to destroy, but suddenly doth fall\r\n        On root and branch, stock and original.\"\r\n\r\n        _Virgil's Georgics_, Lib. III.\r\n\r\nThe reason of so many different things having, from first to last,\r\nbeen reckoned capable of producing this disease, appears to lie in the\r\nknown fact, that if a sheep be exposed to any of the above depressing\r\nagents, rot, if the animal be as yet untainted, will not, at the\r\nmoment, shew itself; but a chain of morbid actions will in all\r\nprobability then commence, and, being beyond the ken of ordinary\r\nobservers, will pass unheeded, till some slight mismanagement in food\r\nor shelter, hastens their progress, and renders them apparent to the\r\nplainest understanding. The final symptoms of rot may thus occur on any\r\nkind of pasture, and the scene of the catastrophe will incur a stigma\r\nwhich ought to be attached to herbage which the sheep have consumed at\r\nsome distant place or date.\r\n\r\nBad food is justly regarded as one of the most common causes of rot,\r\nand ranks, in my estimation, next to cold and wet, in its power of\r\nproducing it. I shall only remark, on this point, that of all the\r\nfood on which sheep can possibly be kept, none is known to act so\r\ndeleteriously as grass which has sprouted quickly. Rot is well known to\r\noccur most frequently on land which has been irrigated during summer,\r\nfor at this season any excess of moisture is peculiarly injurious to\r\nthe economy of a plant.\r\n\r\nWhen plants by heat and moisture are stimulated to increased exertion\r\non a poor soil, they acquire bulk without having it in their power to\r\nobtain at the same time those saline matters which constitute a healthy\r\nplant, becoming in fact, to the eye of an inexperienced person,\r\nthriving vegetables, while to the palate they prove wersh and watery.\r\n\r\nThe same result may follow from a different process. The saline matter\r\nmay not be taken up, even when the soil is rich in such ingredients,\r\nfrom the functional derangement into which the roots or digestive\r\norgans have been thrown by the unnatural circumstances in which it has\r\nbeen placed. A plant is composed, like all organized bodies, of a\r\ncertain number of proximate principles, which are more or less numerous\r\nin different kinds. These are combined with varying quantities of\r\npotass, soda, lime, magnesia, and iron, which, though formerly supposed\r\nto be too trifling in quantity materially to affect the quality of the\r\nplant, have yet been recently and satisfactorily proved completely\r\nto change the character of the compound, even when the excess or\r\ndeficiency amounts only to a 1/10000th part so that, supposing an\r\nanimal to thrive on plants which contain salts of any or all of the\r\nabove bodies, it will soon fall off if these plants are in any way\r\ndeprived of a single adjunct; for by the removal of that one salt,\r\ntheir nature has been entirely altered.\r\n\r\nThe certainty and rapidity with which Bakewell could rot his sheep, by\r\npasturing them, in Autumn, on land over which water had been allowed\r\nto flow during the previous summer, may seem to controvert what I\r\nhave above stated, as to time and frequent change of pasture often\r\nintervening between the origin of the disease, and its termination; but\r\nwhen it is recollected that he pursued the destructive system of\r\nbreeding _in_ and _in_, of itself sufficient to induce a tuberculous\r\npredisposition, the reader will perceive that his sheep were, in all\r\nlikelihood, more or less tainted, and therefore, sure to fall victims\r\nto the disease the moment they were subjected to the deleterious\r\ninfluence of an unwholesome pasture.[39]\r\n\r\n        [39] When parcels of Mr Bakewell's best sheep became, from any\r\n        defect, unserviceable to him, he used to fatten them for the\r\n        butcher. But as there was a _probability_ of their becoming\r\n        valuable in other hands, he always gave them the rot before he\r\n        sold them! An example, which, I hope, for the sake both of man\r\n        and sheep, never to see followed.\r\n\r\nOver-driving and hurrying of every kind, is, in my opinion, a fruitful\r\nsource of rot, not only from the fatigue it causes, or the risk it\r\nleads to of taking cold, but also from the injury, which in many cases\r\nresults, to the delicate texture of the lungs. As shown in the note to\r\nparagraph (157), no animal is more easily put out of breath by running,\r\nthan the sheep. Whenever the breathing is hurried, the circulation\r\nthrough the lungs is quickened also. If the tissue of the lungs be in\r\nany way delicate, the force with which the blood is propelled is sure\r\nto make it yield, and in this manner the animal is often suffocated by\r\nthe large quantity of blood, which issues into the air tubes at once\r\nfrom many points. Fig. 1, Plate VI. exhibits a good illustration of\r\nthis taken from a sheep. Numerous red points are seen sprinkled over\r\nthe surface of the section, indicating that blood has been effused from\r\nmany minute torn vessels. Now, if this animal had survived, each speck\r\nof blood would have formed a centre, round which tuberculous matter, as\r\nin Fig. 2, Plate VI. would have been secreted, and death from rot, at\r\nsome ulterior period, would, in all probability, have been the\r\nresult.[40]\r\n\r\n        [40] Pathologists differ as to whether tubercle is the cause or\r\n        consequence of _hemoptysis_, as this effusion of blood into the\r\n        tissue of the lungs is termed. Andral, however, is decidedly of\r\n        opinion that hemoptysis is one of the exciting causes, and, in\r\n        domestic animals, I believe it to precede tubercle more\r\n        frequently than is generally imagined.\r\n\r\n(165.) _Treatment of Rot._ As reason and experience have taught us that\r\ntathy herbage is a common cause of this complaint, we should, when it\r\nshows itself, at once remove the animals to a better pasture, where\r\nthey should be exempted from teazing of every kind.\r\n\r\nSalt appears, after every trial, to be the best medicine, and to this\r\nthey should have, at all times, ready access. Should the disease be\r\nrather far advanced, the breathing hurried, and the cough annoying,\r\noccasional doses of the following infusion will be of service, in\r\nenabling the farmer to keep down the disease, till such time as he can\r\nconveniently dispose of the animal.\r\n\r\n    Take of Leaves of Foxglove two ounces,\r\n            Boiling water two English pints:\r\n\r\npour the water on the leaves, cover up the vessel, and keep it in a\r\nwarm place for six or eight hours, then strain.\r\n\r\nTwo tea-spoonfuls morning and evening may be given to a sheep, but as\r\nthe plant is an active poison, and the strength of its infusion liable\r\nto vary, a couple of days should always intervene between every six\r\ndoses.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1800, a notion prevailed in this country, that an\r\neffectual remedy for rot had been discovered by the Dutch, but this was\r\nquite unfounded, no _cure_ ever having been hit upon for this sweeping\r\nmalady; indeed, a cure is fairly out of the question: its prevention\r\nand palliation, but not its eradication, being all that we can hope\r\nfor. Sundry plausible plans of treatment have, however, at one time or\r\nanother been contrived, some of them, in all conscience, harmless\r\nenough, but others again as well adapted for the destruction of the\r\nanimal, as the removal of the disease.\r\n\r\nAs fluke worms have usually been reckoned the cause of rot, so the\r\ntreatment has principally consisted in attempts to effect their\r\nextermination. With this view, Sir George Steuart Mackenzie of Coule,\r\nin defiance of all preconceived medical opinion, advocated, in his work\r\non _Sheep_, published in 1809, the employment of mercury to stay the\r\nprogress of rot, and in the same work, _or one very like it_, as lately\r\npublished anonymously by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful\r\nKnowledge, under the title of the _Mountain Shepherd's Manual_, the\r\nutility of this dangerous procedure is as firmly maintained. At the\r\nsame time Sir George, though rather in the dark as to the real nature\r\nof the disease, admits, in both editions, that tubercles exist in rot,\r\nespecially in the lungs. Now, if he had inquired of any medical person\r\nwhat drug ought, when tubercles are present, of all others to be\r\navoided, he would have found that medicine to be mercury. The\r\nadministration of it therefore in rot, no matter what may be the form\r\nor mode in which it is exhibited, will to a certainty aggravate the\r\nsymptoms, and shorten life. If, for the sake of doing something, you\r\nwill _endeavour_ to remove the worms, Chabert's animal oil will be\r\nfound a safe and efficacious remedy; but, if my opinion can have any\r\nweight, I would recommend the farmer to allow them to remain.\r\n\r\nSheep, when displaying symptoms of rot, should always be kept dry and\r\nwarm. If they must be retained throughout the winter, good sound solid\r\nfood, such as well made hay or oats, should be afforded them, and the\r\nshelter of a straw yard should if possible be obtained. A liberal\r\nsupply of salt should be given with all their provender; and if they do\r\nnot seem to relish it, give them occasionally a small quantity in water\r\nas a drench.\r\n\r\n(166.) _Prevention of Rot._ On this head I need do little more than\r\nremark that attention to the causes will go a great way to point out\r\nthe necessary means for its prevention. Admission of the sheep to rank\r\nsoft grass, heavy stocking, short allowance of food during winter,\r\nevery thing in fact which leads to the exposure of the animal should be\r\nscrupulously avoided. The strongest constitution cannot with impunity\r\nbe tampered with, and the soundest habit will fall before the mining\r\nattacks of want and weather. Keep your stock always in as high health\r\nas possible, for such is the surest prevention of tuberculous disease.\r\n\r\nAs rot is hereditary,[41] the importance of weeding out ewes from the\r\nflock on their first exhibiting appearances of unsoundness, is\r\nacknowledged by all. Many ways have been pointed out for detecting the\r\nincipient symptoms, but none plainer and better than those written by\r\nthe late Mr Beattie of Muckledale, and published in the 3d vol. of the\r\n_Highland Society's Transactions_. \"The first thing to be observed,\"\r\nsays Mr Beattie, \"is in the spring, when they are dropping their lambs.\r\nA sound ewe, in good order, drops a lamb covered with a thick and\r\nyellow slime, which the ewe licks off it, and the rule is, the sounder\r\nand the higher the condition the ewe is in, the darker and thicker will\r\nbe the slime; but when they observe a ewe drop a lamb covered with thin\r\nwatery bubbles, and very white, they note her down as unsound.\"\r\n\r\n        [41] MM. Dupuy and Andral have seen tubercles in the foetus\r\n        of the sheep.\r\n\r\n\"About the month of September, when they intend to dispose of their\r\ndraught ewes, they put all their sheep into a fold, and draw them by\r\nthe hand, that is, they catch them all, viz. the ewes they design to\r\nsell any of, and clapping their hand upon the small of the back, they\r\nrub the flesh backwards and forwards between their fingers and thumb\r\nand the ends of the short ribs: if the flesh be solid and firm, they\r\nconsider her as sound; if they find it soft and flabby, and if, when\r\nthey rub it against the short ribs, it ripples, as we term it, that is,\r\na sort of crackling is perceived, as if there were water or blubber in\r\nit, they are certain she is unsound. This is the most certain of all\r\nsymptoms, but is not to be discerned with any degree of certainty but\r\nby an experienced hand; for although, as I have here related it, it\r\nseems a very simple affair, and easily acquired, yet it is well known\r\nthat many shepherds, who have followed sheep all their lives, never\r\narrived at any thing like certainty in judging by the hand, whilst men\r\nof superior skill will seldom be mistaken, and will draw by no other\r\nrule. Yet still it must be acknowledged that the seeds of this disease\r\nwill sometimes lie so occult, as to baffle all skill, and that no man\r\ncan with absolute certainty draw a stock tainted with the rot. There is\r\nanother method, to which men of inferior skill resort, which is more\r\neasily acquired. They take a sheep's head between their hands, and\r\npress down the eyelids, they thereby make the sheep turn its eyeball so\r\nthat they get a view of the vessels in which the eyeball rolls: if\r\nthese are thin, red, and free of matter, they consider the sheep as\r\nsound; but if they are thick, of a dead white colour, and seem as if\r\nthere was some white matter in them, they are confident she is rotten.\r\nThis is a pretty general rule, and easily discerned; but I think it is\r\nnot so certain as when they are judged by the back; for in firm healthy\r\nlands the eye of a sheep is far redder than it is in sheep upon grassy\r\nlands. And in some boggy lands the eye is never very red, be the sheep\r\never so sound, so that there you cannot so well judge by the eye; but\r\nwhen you see the eye of a sheep a good deal whiter and thicker, and\r\nmore matter in it (I mean the vessels in which the eyeball rolls) than\r\nthe run of the flock amongst which it feeds, you have reason to suspect\r\nit is not sound.\r\n\r\n\"There is another method by which I have seen some men attempt to judge\r\nof the soundness of sheep. It is a well known fact, that when sheep are\r\nrotten the lungs swell to a greater size; they therefore lay the sheep\r\ndown upon its broad side, and pressing the skin in at the flank, up\r\nbelow the ribs, _pretend_ to feel the lungs. But if there is anything\r\nto be learned by this I could never perceive it, and have seen some\r\nmen, who pretended to know most by it, very often mistaken.\r\n\r\n\"These are the principal rules by which the Highland farmers draw their\r\nstocks; and they relate all to ewe stocks; for as to wedders, they are\r\ngenerally all sold off when they are three years old, and those that\r\nbuy them for feeding mostly buy them by the condition they appear\r\noutwardly to be in at the time, and the character of the ground upon\r\nwhich they were bred.\"\r\n\r\n(167.) _Jaundice._ I have never seen this disease in the sheep, and\r\nhave heard almost nothing of it; indeed it is very rare, few having\r\never witnessed cases of it. It is consequently very imperfectly\r\nunderstood, every one who has written about it assigning for its\r\noccurrence a different cause. The principal symptoms to be depended on,\r\naccording to those who have treated it, are a yellowness of the eyes,\r\nand an obstinate sluggishness of the animal, almost amounting to sleep.\r\nCopious bleeding and two ounce doses of Glauber salts have been\r\nrecommended for the treatment, which must be gone about promptly, as\r\nthe disease is said to be quickly fatal. Reasoning from what is known\r\nabout jaundice in man, I would, were a case to occur to me in the\r\nsheep, give a good dose of calomel, say 15 grains, in conjunction with\r\nthe salts, unless the disease had supervened on rot, when I would\r\nsubstitute ten grains of ipecacuanha for the mercury.\r\n\r\n(168.) _Dropsy._ When it is the concluding symptom of a disease, it may\r\nbe reckoned part of the complaint itself, and treated accordingly.\r\nOften, however, it is the first thing which attracts the attention of\r\nthe shepherd, and when such is the case it will usually be traced to\r\nlong exposure to cold and wet. In this event the best plan is to bleed\r\nlargely, and give two or three smart doses of Epsom salts. When it\r\noccurs in young lambs, sweet spirit of nitre, given in the quantity of\r\na tea-spoonful twice a-day, is found to be attended with the happiest\r\neffects. Tapping, or, as it is popularly termed, _stabbing_, or\r\n_sticking_, to permit the escape of the water, is the cure resorted to\r\nin South Africa, when it appears in old sheep, after exposure to rain;\r\nbut this ought never to be resorted to unless under the guidance of a\r\nmedical person. It would be much better at once to kill the sheep.\r\n\r\n(169.) _Sturdy._ As shown in the tabular view of the diseases, in\r\nfoot-note to paragraph (121), this affection may be the result either\r\nof pressure on the brain from an animal growth, or from the\r\naccumulation of a fluid. Serum is in both cases the mechanical cause of\r\nthe symptoms, but in the former it is eliminated from neighbouring\r\nparts by a hydatid, while in the latter it is merely deposited in some\r\nof the natural cavities (the ventricles) of the brain, owing to a\r\ncongested state of the spinal marrow, the result of continued cold upon\r\nthe back.\r\n\r\nFigure 2, Plate VII., taken from Rudolphi, exhibits a view of the\r\nanimal which gives rise to the first variety of sturdy. It is the\r\nmany-headed hydatid of the brain, _Coenurus Cerebralis_ of naturalists.\r\nLike the _Cysticercus tenuicollis_, already described under the head of\r\nRot, it consists of a thin membranous cyst, full or otherwise of serous\r\nfluid; but, unlike the aforementioned animal is studded over with\r\ngroups of little velvety appendages or heads, each of which has a\r\nseries of barbs projecting round the mouth. Figure 2, _a_, Plate VII.,\r\nis a highly magnified representation of two of these heads.\r\n\r\nA good idea of the hydatid, as it exists in the sheep, may be derived\r\nfrom an inspection of Fig 1. Pl. VIII., which has been engraved from a\r\nsketch kindly furnished to me by my friend Dr Kirk of Deal. Fig. 1\r\nrepresents the brain of a sheep two years old, which has been affected\r\nwith sturdy. The right lobe, _a_, of the cerebellum or lesser brain, is\r\nmuch distended with fluid, which is enclosed in a membraneous bag, as\r\nshown at _b_, where an incision has been made to expose it, and at _c_,\r\nwhere it is shining through one of the coverings of the brain, the pia\r\nmater.\r\n\r\nThe hydatid is found of all sizes, from that of a pea to that of Fig.\r\n2, Plate VII. Large ones are far from rare, and the ventricle is\r\nfrequently enormously distended. The hydatid in the brain from which\r\nFig. 2, Plate VIII. was taken, though not filled to repletion,\r\ncontained ten drachms of serum. The ventricle was consequently much\r\ndilated, as shown at _a_ in that figure, and the usual course and size\r\nof the convolutions completely altered. Instead of being folded, like\r\nthe intestines, upon themselves, they proceeded, as seen at _b b_, from\r\nback to front of the brain; while the furrows between them, which are,\r\nin the healthy animal, usually too shallow to be measured, were in\r\nseveral places as deep as the length of the lines at _c d_.\r\n\r\nThis excessive accumulation of fluid within the brain leads, as might\r\nbe expected, to the dilatation of the skull, and to the absorption of\r\nits walls, when the bones, young though the animal be when affected\r\nwith sturdy, can no longer be made to yield. For this reason the skull,\r\ntowards the termination of the disease, generally becomes thin and soft\r\nin front of the root of the horn, and in this way offers a spot which,\r\nfrom its being easily pierced, is frequently made the seat of surgical\r\noperations. Other parts of the skull also undergo considerable\r\nthinning, more so indeed than in front of the horn. The attention of\r\nthe farmer has hardly, if ever, been called to this fact, though I\r\nbelieve that, for one instance in which perforation occurs in the\r\nfrontal bone, it will be noticed a score of times on the sides of the\r\nhead. In a head with which I was favoured by Mr Grieve, Branxholm\r\nbraes, each temple, exactly beneath the superior extremity of the\r\nupright branch of the lower jaw, displayed a circular opening entirely\r\nthrough the bone, wide enough to permit the passage of an ounce bullet.\r\n\r\nWhatever may produce pressure on the brain, the symptoms which indicate\r\nit are nearly always the same. The sheep has a dull, stupid look, turns\r\nvery often round and round, and will, when water is in its way, stand\r\nstaring at it till at last, giddy and confused, it plumps fairly in.\r\nIf, when the symptoms are very unpromising, convulsive movements should\r\noccur, they may be taken as a favourable sign, as they indicate a\r\ndiminution of the pressure on the brain. A minute description of the\r\nmorbid appearances in hydrocephalus could serve no good purpose, I\r\ntherefore pass on to the prevention of sturdy.\r\n\r\n(170.) _Treatment and Prevention of Sturdy._ The variety caused by\r\nhydatids can only be prevented by the use of dry, well grown, wholesome\r\nfood. Dr Jenner found that he could cause hydatids to form in rabbits\r\nat will, by feeding them on green succulent provision; and it is well\r\nknown that this form of sturdy prevails among sheep chiefly in marshy\r\nplaces, as the fens of Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\nWater in the head is generally induced, as first pointed out by the\r\nEttrick Shepherd, in the _Farmer's Magazine_ for 1812, by the back of\r\nthe animal being chilled, as is evident from the following facts:--\r\n\r\n    \"1. It is always most general after a windy and sleety winter.\r\n\r\n    \"2. It is always most destructive on farms that are ill-sheltered,\r\n    and on which the sheep are most exposed to those blasts and\r\n    showers.\r\n\r\n    \"3. It preys only on sheep rising their first year, the wool of\r\n    which separates above, leaving the back quite exposed to the wet\r\n    and cold.\r\n\r\n    \"4. If a piece of cloth or hide is sewed to the wool, so as to\r\n    cover the back, such a sheep will not be affected with the\r\n    disease.\"\r\n\r\nBratting is therefore the best preventive, and it is as cheap as it is\r\neffectual. One pair of old blankets, worth only some four or five\r\nshillings, will furnish coverings for forty hogs, and if laid carefully\r\naside in spring, they will continue serviceable for two or three years.\r\nAn operation can avail nothing--slaughtering the sheep is therefore the\r\nonly expedient.\r\n\r\nWhen the existence of a hydatid near the surface of the brain is\r\ndenoted by the skull yielding, at some particular spot, to the firm\r\npressure of the thumb, its extraction must be set about in the manner\r\ndescribed in paragraph (118), where I have also given my objections to\r\nthe common modes of operating.\r\n\r\n(171.) _Trembling._ Several affections are included under the name of\r\n_trembling_ or _leaping-ill_, all having, in common, more or less of\r\nthe symptoms which these names denote. They may be considered as\r\narising from exposure to cold and damp, especially on long fatiguing\r\njournies, as in bringing sheep from the Highlands to the south of\r\nScotland, when it frequently prevails to so great an extent, on\r\nreaching the low country, as to oblige the shepherd to leave eight or\r\nten behind him at every stage. Injuries of the loins, either inflicted\r\nby themselves in jumping and running, or by others from rough usage in\r\nthe fold, are common causes of the disease; but in this variety the\r\nhind quarters only are powerless. Another species is owing to\r\noppression of the brain from congestion, in this way resembling\r\nincipient sturdy, and occurring only in very fat sheep.\r\n\r\n(172.) _Treatment of Trembling._ The first variety is best met by rest,\r\nshelter, and a supply of nutritious food; but as the animal is\r\nincapable, in many cases, of collecting it, the shepherd must lift it\r\nfrom one rich part of the field to another, so soon as it has cleared\r\naway the grass within its reach. In the second kind, as caused by\r\naccident, the sheep must be slaughtered, as, should a cure be\r\nattempted, the treatment will be too tedious and complicated to succeed\r\nin ordinary hands. Copious blood-letting, and doses of Epsom salts,\r\nwill be found of most advantage in the third species; but if the sheep\r\ncan be disposed of so much the better, as this kind of _trembling_ is\r\nalmost certain, unless combated by energetic depletion, to end in\r\nsturdy.\r\n\r\n(173.) _Wood Evil_ is nothing more than a cramp of the hind legs, owing\r\nto water dripping upon them from trees after a shower of rain, and is\r\nbest treated by enveloping them in flannel, wrung out of hot water; but\r\nif the sheep is at the time very chill, gentle friction must first be\r\nused, else dangerous consequences will ensue. Rubbing with warm\r\nturpentine has been recommended, and is apparently worthy of a trial.\r\n\r\n(174.) _Inflamed Eyes._ The pollen of flowers getting into the eyes\r\nwhile feeding, is a common cause of this annoyance, which need not be\r\ndescribed, as, from being visible, it is known to all. Examine the\r\neyes, and remove any irritating body. Then, if the disease be of recent\r\ndate, bleed the animal largely from the jugular vein, and give it\r\nseveral doses of Epsom, or Glauber's salt. After the inflammation is\r\nsubdued, or should it be in the suppurating stage when first noticed,\r\nhold the lids asunder, and drop upon the eye, three or four times a\r\nday, a solution of white vitriol, five grains to the ounce of water.\r\nWhere this cannot be had, pure _cold_ water dashed against the eyes and\r\nhead several times a day will serve as a substitute.\r\n\r\nThough sheep are not so much incommoded by blindness as other animals,\r\nfrom the instinctive care usually taken of the sufferer by the rest of\r\nthe flock, still such a mishap should always be prevented by energetic\r\ntreatment at the commencement of the symptoms.\r\n\r\n(175.) _Soft Cancer of the Eye_, or, as it is also called by medical\r\nmen, _Fungus Hematodes_, is of very rare occurrence among sheep, and\r\nindeed would not have deserved a notice here, were it not that, from\r\nbeing a malignant disease, it might be looked upon as quite incurable.\r\nI can only describe it as a soft, spongy tumour, rising from the bottom\r\nof the eye, involving all the textures of that organ, so as to render\r\nthem scarcely recognizable, and bleeding on the slightest touch. It is\r\nreadily removed by passing a stout thread through the front of the eye\r\nwith a needle, so as to afford the operator a hold by which to pull it\r\noutwards with the left hand, while, with the right, he cuts round it\r\nwith a narrow-bladed knife. The operation is attended only with slight\r\npain, but must not be considered the sole curative means; the sheep\r\nmust have, at the same time, a frequent change of pasture, to prevent a\r\nrecurrence of the tumour.\r\n\r\nThere is a very large tumour of this description at present in the\r\nmuseum of Guy's Hospital, taken from a sheep which recovered perfectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON THE MANAGEMENT OF SHEEP IN AUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the preceding pages were not written so much for the well-educated\r\nfarmer, as for those who practise sheep-husbandry without previous\r\ntraining, it may not be considered amiss, consistently with the plan\r\nof the work, to sum up the chief points to be attended to in the\r\nmanagement of sheep in Australia. This I shall do from the best\r\nauthorities, and guided by the direct advice of extensive sheep\r\nproprietors who have long resided there, and had every experience in\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nThough it was for some time, according to Dr Lang,[42] a matter of\r\ncontroversy in the colony, whether the Merino or the Saxon Merino\r\nproduced the finer wool or was more profitable for the sheep-farmer;\r\nthe preference is now given to the Saxon breed, as they not only yield\r\nan excellent fleece, but are much superior in carcass to the pure\r\nMerino. The fact, however, of Australia having been considered, from\r\nits earliest colonization, as unrivalled by any country in the quality\r\nof its wool, goes far to prove that, with ordinary care, almost any\r\nvariety may be brought to yield a very superior produce. The mildness\r\nof the climate, the extensive range of pasture, the steady supply of\r\nfood, and the consequent unvarying health of the animal, give the\r\npoorest breeds a superiority which could hardly be attained in any\r\nother quarter of the world. Indeed, as noticed at paragraph (70.),\r\nAustralia appears by nature intended to produce fine wool, and fine\r\nanimals, even from the worst beginnings.\r\n\r\n        [42] History of New South Wales, Vol. i. p. 309.\r\n\r\nGreat, however, as the capabilities of the colony are for the growth of\r\nthe finest wools, the intending emigrant must not suppose that he will\r\nobtain them without devoting to the subject a particular portion of his\r\nregard. Mild warm air, and abundant diet, will go far towards putting\r\nhim in possession of a superior flock; but without earnest attention to\r\nthe minor details required in the management of his sheep, the most\r\nfavourable locality will avail him little.\r\n\r\nLet Australia be ever so much praised, as being peculiarly adapted for\r\nthe rearing of sheep, they have there, in common with every kind of\r\nanimal in every part of the world, a certain liability to disease.\r\nWith all its boasted steadiness of climate, bad seasons occasionally\r\noccur, and lead to sickness among the flocks, and in addition to the\r\nusual chances of loss arising from this cause in other countries,\r\nthere is, in some parts of it, a still more dreaded mischief resulting\r\nalmost unavoidably from the moral constitution of its society. A\r\nconvict-servant who has a pique at his master, has it often entirely in\r\nhis own power to subject the flocks under his charge to some one or\r\nother of the serious diseases to which sheep in all countries are\r\npeculiarly liable. He may pasture them on an improper spot, and thus\r\ninduce diarrhoea, or even rot; or he may drive them a few miles from\r\ntheir usual feeding ground, as Dr Lang remarks, when there is nobody\r\npresent to take cognizance of the fact, and thereby bring them into\r\ncontact with a scabbed flock. \"The chief source of the wealth and\r\nprosperity of the colony,\" says Dr Lang, \"is thus, in great measure, at\r\nthe mercy of the most worthless of men; and so much is this the case,\r\nthat a highly respectable and intelligent magistrate, observed in the\r\ncourse of a short conversation I had with him before embarking for\r\nEngland, that if there should not be a large annual importation of free\r\nemigrant shepherds from the mother country into the colony, the owners\r\nof sheep throughout the territory will in future be under the necessity\r\nof reducing, or rather of preventing the increase of, their flocks.\"\r\nThus circumstanced, the Australian settler has surely sufficient\r\nreasons for inducing him to make himself familiar with the management\r\nand diseases of the animal, on which he is placing his principal\r\ndependence.\r\n\r\nWhen the country is destitute of timber, the sheep are very easily\r\nmanaged, and so many as a thousand may be trusted to a single shepherd;\r\nbut in general, they are divided into flocks of about three hundred\r\nbreeding ewes, or four hundred wethers. \"Every flock,\" says Mr\r\nCunningham, \"has a shepherd, who takes his sheep out to graze before\r\nsunrise in the morning, and brings them in after sunset at night. He\r\nkeeps always before the flock to check the forward among them from\r\nrunning onwards, and wearing out the old, sick, and lame; making all\r\nthus feed quietly, so as to keep them in good condition. In summer, he\r\nsees too that they have water during the heat of the day; and in\r\ndrawing up under a tree for shade, when it is too hot for feeding, he\r\npasses occasionally gently among them, spreads them out and makes them\r\ntake a fresh position in as small groups as possible, under another\r\ntree; because when they remain too long together in one place, they are\r\napt to become broken winded. It is a rule that sheep should never\r\nremain in one spot so long as to paddle the ground much with their\r\nfeet; and hence, in riding round your sheep stations, you have\r\nsomething whereby to judge whether or not your instructions are\r\nattended to. The shepherd takes out his victuals with him, and is\r\nrequired to be on the alert all day long, to prevent the sheep from\r\nbeing lost in the woods, or the native dogs from pouncing in among\r\nthem. They must always be driven slowly to pasture, and if you perceive\r\nthat the shepherd can walk quietly among them, without disturbing them,\r\nyou may set him down as a gentle and careful man; for if he uses his\r\nflock harshly, they will be naturally terrified by him. Three flocks\r\nare always penned together under the charge of a watchman, who counts\r\neach regularly _in_ at night, and the shepherds again count them _out_\r\nin the morning; so that they form a regular check upon each other, and\r\nprevent losses from carelessness or depredation. The watchman has a\r\nsmall weather-proof watch-box to sleep in, and is assisted by a\r\nwatch-dog; he keeps up a good fire, which generally deters all native\r\ndogs from approaching the fold. The hurdles are made of light swamp\r\noak, iron bark, or gum, measuring seven feet long, with five bars, so\r\nclose together that a young lamb cannot creep through, and usually cost\r\nabout 1s. 6d. a-piece. They are shifted to fresh ground daily, being\r\nsloped outwards, and propped together by means of forked sticks,\r\ndriving a stake through between the bars here and there to keep the\r\nhurdles firm, and prevent the wind from blowing them over, little\r\nsupport being derived from their feet, which are pressed but slightly\r\ninto the ground. All branches of trees are carefully removed from the\r\nhurdled grounds before the sheep are driven in, to prevent any of the\r\nlatter being staked; the hurdles too are never pitched where ant hills\r\nare, or under a tree with rotten boughs upon it, while the trees with\r\nblack bark are carefully denuded thereof, to prevent discolouration of\r\nthe wool.\" Bells are attached to the necks of the stoutest leaders, to\r\nkeep the flock together, and give warning of any thing going wrong\r\nwithin the fold.\r\n\r\nThe breeding season is, in some instances, at the commencement of\r\nsummer, in others, at the commencement of winter, but in general it is\r\nin March or April, the rams having been put to the ewes in October.\r\nThis deviation from our practice of spring lambing, is owing, according\r\nto Mr Cunningham, to the breeders finding that the pasture is\r\nparticularly good in the autumn, from a sort of second spring taking\r\nplace, while the lambs stand the cold better than the heat, and are\r\nless annoyed by the gad-flies. The sheep usually double their number\r\nevery four years.\r\n\r\nSheep-shearing takes place at the beginning of summer. The usual plan\r\nof washing is previously had recourse to (see paragraph 99.), but of\r\nlate it has become customary, with some proprietors, to wash them with\r\na spout. This is done by bringing them one by one under a stream of\r\nwater, falling from a moderate height; but it is not likely that it\r\nwill ever be generally adopted, as it requires very peculiar facilities\r\nin regard to water, and is besides a plan fraught with danger to the\r\nsheep. It ought to be kept in mind, that a stream of water playing on\r\nthe body, produces a very stunning effect, which may destroy life in\r\nan inconsiderable time, and has, in this way, been often employed\r\nfor putting criminals to death. Be this as it may, the Australian\r\nsheep-farmers have doubtless been led to resort to the spout, owing to\r\nthe fleeces being so full of filth as to be cleaned with difficulty in\r\nthe common way. The finer the wool, the more abundant is the yolk or\r\nviscid secretion on the skin, and the greater, consequently, is the\r\nquantity of filth which sticks to it. The dirtiness of the wool\r\nbecomes, in this way, no mean test of the value of the sheep. Some of\r\nthe fleeces lose fully three-fifths of their weight by washing. The\r\naverage weight of the fleeces from the improved breeds, is from two to\r\ntwo-and-a-half pounds. The ewe fleece seldom exceeds one pound and a\r\nhalf. \"The wool is packed in bales, wrapped in canvass, and forwarded\r\nfor exportation to Sydney, on drays drawn by oxen. Some of the more\r\nextensive sheep-farmers send home their wool direct to their agents in\r\nLondon, where it is sold according to its quality, at from one to three\r\nshillings, (the freight to London being only three-halfpence) a\r\npound.\"[43]\r\n\r\n        [43] Historical Account of New South Wales, by John Dunmore\r\n        Lang, D.D., Vol. i. p. 350.\r\n\r\nThe highest prices yet obtained for some of the picked parts of the\r\nfinest fleeces, are 10s. 6d. per pound. This, however, has been given\r\nonly once.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of wool shipped in 1835, was 3,776,191 lbs., and was\r\nvalued at L380,000 sterling.\r\n\r\nThree acres are required on an average for the support of each sheep,\r\nbut on account of the mildness of the climate, there is no necessity\r\nfor providing winter food.\r\n\r\nThe range of pasture is so extensive that the sheep are liable to\r\ncomparatively few diseases. The great dryness of the climate, keeps the\r\nfleece always in so comfortable a state, that they are almost never\r\nstruck by the fly which, as explained at (147.), always deposits its\r\neggs on the moistest part of the skin. Mr Cunningham once observed\r\nsummer-dropt lambs with milk blotches, become fly blown, but this was\r\nin wet weather. Scab, or itch, is the most common disease, but of it I\r\nneed not say any thing here. It never presents much variety, and is a\r\ndisease better understood than almost any other. Ample directions for\r\nits treatment are given at (140.). It is easily checked if the job is\r\ngone about with determination. The great points are to take it in\r\nhand the moment it appears--for when it gains ground, all chances\r\nof a wool-crop are at an end for that year at least--and to use\r\ntobacco-juice most liberally, as it not only leads to the immediate\r\ndeath of the itch insect, but appears to have a specific effect in\r\nleading to the restoration of the wool. The balm of Columbia, which is\r\nat present so lauded for accelerating the growth of hair, is supposed,\r\non good grounds, to be an incognito preparation of tobacco-juice. Rot\r\nis the only other important sheep-disease in the colony. It was unknown\r\ntill 1827, when it broke out in a wet lying part of the Bathurst\r\ndistrict, and succeeded, as Cunningham says, in that part of the\r\ncountry scourged by it, to a long fall of heavy rains, which\r\nsupersaturated the blades of grass. For the method of treating this\r\ndisease, fortunately rare in Australia, I must, in conclusion, refer to\r\nthe body of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's A Treatise on Sheep:, by Ambrose Blacklock",
