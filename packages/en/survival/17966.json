These depredations include not only the attacks\r\nby introduced rats and mice on food materials stored in granaries,\r\nwarehouses, commercial establishments, docks, and private houses, but\r\nalso, particularly in the Western States, the ravages of several groups\r\nof native ground squirrels and other noxious rodents in grain and\r\ncertain other field crops. Nor is this all, for it has been found that\r\nsuch rodents as prairie dogs, pocket gophers, marmots, ground squirrels,\r\nand rabbits take appreciable and serious toll of the forage on the open\r\ngrazing range; in fact, that they reduce the carrying capacity of the\r\nrange to such an extent that expenditures for control measures are amply\r\njustified. Current estimates place the loss of goods due to rats and\r\nmice in warehouses and stores throughout the United States at no less\r\nthan $200,000,000 annually, and damage to the carrying capacity of the\r\nopen range and to cultivated crops generally by native rodents in the\r\nWestern States at $300,000,000 additional; added together, we have an\r\nimpressive total from depredations of rodents.\r\n\r\nThe distribution and life habits of rodents and the general\r\nconsideration of their relation to agriculture, forestry, and grazing,\r\nwith special reference to the carrying capacity of stock ranges, is a\r\nsubject that has received attention for many years from the Biological\r\nSurvey of the United States Department of Agriculture. As a result of\r\nthe investigations conducted much has been learned concerning the\r\neconomic status of most of the more important groups, and the knowledge\r\nalready gained forms the basis of the extensive rodent-control work\r\nalready in progress, and in which many States are cooperating with the\r\nbureau. If the work is to be prosecuted intelligently and the fullest\r\nmeasure of success achieved, it is essential that the consideration\r\nlargely of groups as a whole be supplemented by more exhaustive\r\ntreatment of the life histories of individual species and of their place\r\nin the biological complex. The present report is based upon\r\ninvestigations, chiefly in Arizona, of the life history, habits, and\r\neconomic status of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat, _Dipodomys\r\nspectabilis spectabilis_ Merriam (Pl. I).\r\n\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATIONAL METHODS.\r\n\r\nSome 18 years ago (in 1903) a tract of land 49.2 square miles in area on\r\nthe Coronado National Forest near the Santa Rita Mountains, Pima County,\r\nsouthern Arizona, was closed to grazing by arrangement between the\r\nForest Service and the Agricultural Experiment Station of the University\r\nof Arizona. Since that time another small tract of nearly a section has\r\nbeen inclosed (Griffiths, 1910, 7[1]). This total area of approximately\r\n50 square miles is known as the United States Range Reserve, and is\r\nbeing devoted to a study of grazing conditions in this section and to\r\nworking out the best methods of administering the range (Pl. II, Fig.\r\n1).\r\n\r\nFor some years an intensive study of the forage and other vegetative\r\nconditions of this area has been made, the permanent vegetation quadrat,\r\nas proposed by Dr. F. E. Clements (1905, 161-175), being largely\r\nutilized. During the autumn of 1917 representatives of the Carnegie\r\nInstitution and the Arizona Agricultural Experiment Station visited the\r\nReserve and were impressed with the evidence of rodent damage to the\r\ngrass cover. The most conspicuous appearance of damage was noted about\r\nthe habitations of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat (_Dipodomys\r\nspectabilis spectabilis_ Merriam), although it was observed also that\r\njack rabbits of two species (_Lepus californicus eremicus_ Allen and _L.\r\nalleni alleni_ Mearns), which were very abundant in some portions of the\r\nreserve, were apparently affecting adversely the forage conditions in\r\nparticular localities. Accordingly, the Biological Survey, the\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station of the University of Arizona, the\r\nCarnegie Institution of Washington, and the U. S. Forest Service have\r\nundertaken a study of the relation of the more important rodents to the\r\nforage crop of the Range Reserve in Arizona.\r\n\r\nThe present paper is a first step in this larger investigation.[2] In\r\nthis work the authors have made no attempt to deal with the taxonomic\r\nside of the kangaroo rat problem. It is not unlikely that intensive\r\nstudies will show that the form now known as _Dipodomys spectabilis\r\nspectabilis_ is made up of a number of local variants, some of them\r\nperhaps worthy of recognition as additional subspecies. But it is felt\r\nthat the conclusions here reached will be little, if at all, affected by\r\nsuch developments.\r\n\r\nColor descriptions are based on Ridgway's Color Standards and Color\r\nNomenclature published in 1912.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: References in parentheses are to the Bibliography, p.\r\n    40 (the last figure being to the page of the publication).\r\n    References to authorities where no citation of literature is\r\n    appended relate for the most part to manuscript notes in the files\r\n    of the Biological Survey or the University of Arizona Agricultural\r\n    Experiment Station.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: In addition to assistance rendered by officials of the\r\n    Biological Survey and the University of Arizona, which is hereby\r\n    acknowledged, the authors are indebted to the following persons for\r\n    helpful suggestions and assistance: G.

They are also indebted to\r\n    William Nicholson, of Continental, Ariz., for many courtesies\r\n    extended in connection with work on the Reserve.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDENTIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are only three groups of mammals in the Southwest having external\r\ncheek pouches. These are (_a_) the pocket gophers (Geomyidæ), which have\r\nstrong fore feet, relatively weak hind feet, and short tail, as compared\r\nwith weak fore feet, relatively strong hind feet, and long tail in the\r\nother two; (_b_) the pocket mice (_Perognathus_), which are considerably\r\nsmaller than the kangaroo rats and lack the conspicuous white hip\r\nstripe possessed by all the latter; and (_c_) the kangaroo rats\r\n(_Dipodomys_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Range, east of the Colorado River, of _Dipodomys\r\nspectabilis spectabilis_ compared with that of _Dipodomys merriami_.\r\nCross hatching indicates area of overlapping of the two forms. The range\r\nof _Dipodomys deserti_, not shown on the map, is west of that of\r\n_spectabilis_, and so far as known the two do not overlap.]\r\n\r\n_Dipodomys spectabilis spectabilis_ Merriam requires comparison with\r\nthree other forms of kangaroo rats in the same general region, namely,\r\n_D. deserti_ Stephens, of approximately the same size, and _D. merriami_\r\nMearns and _D. ordii_ Woodhouse, the last two of decidedly smaller size.\r\nThe range of _deserti_ lies principally to the west of that of\r\n_spectabilis_, and the two do not, so far as known, overlap. On the\r\nother hand, _merriami_ and _ordii_, and subspecies, occur over a large\r\npart of the range of _spectabilis_, living in very close proximity to\r\nits burrows; _merriami_ is even suspected of pillaging the stores of\r\n_spectabilis_. The range of _merriami_, however, is much more extensive\r\nthan that of _spectabilis_ (Fig. 1), which argues against a definite\r\necological dependence or relationship. Separation of the four forms\r\nmentioned may be easily accomplished by the following key:\r\n\r\n_Key to Species of_ Dipodomys _in Arizona._\r\n\r\n_a^1_. Size much larger (hind foot and greatest length of skull more\r\nthan 42 millimeters); tail tipped with white.\r\n\r\n     _b^1_. Upper parts dark brownish buffy; tail dark brownish or\r\n     blackish with more sharply contrasted white tip; interparietal\r\n     broader, distinctly separating mastoids (range in Arizona mainly\r\n     southeastern part)                          =Dipodomys spectabilis.=\r\n\r\n     _b^2_. Upper parts light ochraceous-buffy; tail pale brownish with\r\n     less sharply contrasted white tip; interparietal narrower, reduced\r\n     to mere spicule between mastoids (range in Arizona mainly\r\n     southwestern part)                              =Dipodomys deserti.=\r\n\r\n_a^2_. Size much smaller (hind foot and greatest length of skull less\r\nthan 42 millimeters); tail not tipped with white.\r\n\r\n     _b^1_. Hind foot with four toes                =Dipodomys merriami.=\r\n\r\n     _b^2_. Hind foot with five toes                   =Dipodomys ordii.=\r\n\r\nOn account of the small size, _merriami_ and _ordii_ do not require\r\ndetailed color comparison with the other two. The general color of the\r\nupperparts of _spectabilis_ is much darker than that of _deserti_;\r\nwhereas _spectabilis_ is ochraceous-buff or light ochraceous-buff\r\ngrizzled with blackish, _deserti_ is near pale ochraceous-buff and lacks\r\nthe blackish.\r\n\r\nThe color of the upperparts alone amply suffices to distinguish\r\n_spectabilis_ and _deserti_; but the different coloration of the tail is\r\nthe most obvious diagnostic feature. The near black of the middle\r\nportion of the tail, the conspicuous white side stripes, and the pure\r\nwhite tip make the tail of _spectabilis_ stand in rather vivid contrast\r\nto the pale-brown and whitish tail of _deserti_.\r\n\r\nThe dens of the two larger species of _Dipodomys_--_spectabilis_ and\r\n_deserti_--can be distinguished at a glance from those of the two\r\nsmaller--_merriami_ and _ordii_--by the fact that the mounds of the\r\nformer are usually of considerable size and the burrow mouths are of\r\ngreater diameter. On the Range Reserve _merriami_ erects no mounds, but\r\nexcavates its burrows in the open or at the base of _Prosopis_,\r\n_Lycium_, or other brush. The mounds of _spectabilis_ are higher than\r\nthose of _deserti_, the entrances are larger, and they are located in\r\nharder soil (Pl. III, Fig. 1). The dens of _deserti_ are usually more\r\nextensive in surface area than those of _spectabilis_, and have a\r\ngreater number of openings (Pl. III, Fig. 2).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.

Range Reserve at the base of the Santa\r\nRita Mountains, Ariz., where cooperative investigations are being\r\nconducted to ascertain the relation of rodents to forage. This is\r\ntypical of a large section of country occupied by _Dipodomys spectabilis\r\nspectabilis_ and _Dipodomys merriami_. The brush is mesquite\r\n(_Prosopis_), cat's-claw (_Acacia_), and paloverde (_Cercidium_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.

Cranium triangular, the occiput forming the base and the\r\npoint of the nose the apex of the triangle, much flattened, auditory and\r\nparticularly mastoid bullae conspicuously inflated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOR.\r\n\r\nGeneral color above, brownish buffy, varying in some specimens to\r\nlighter buffy tints, grizzled with black; oblique hip stripes white;\r\ntail with dark-brown or blackish stripes above and below, running into\r\nblackish about halfway between base and tip, and with two lateral side\r\nstripes of white to a point about halfway back; tail tipped with pure\r\nwhite for about 40 millimeters (Pl. I). Underparts white, hairs white to\r\nbases, with some plumbeous and buffy hairs about base of tail; fore legs\r\nand fore feet white all around; hind legs like back, brown above, hairs\r\nwith gray bases, becoming blackish (fuscous-black or chætura-black)\r\nabout ankles, hairs on under side white to bases; hind feet white above,\r\ndark-brown or blackish (near fuscous) below.\r\n\r\nColor variations in a series of 12 specimens from the type locality and\r\npoints widely scattered through the range of _spectabilis_ consist in\r\nminor modifications of the degree of coloration, length of white tip of\r\ntail, and length of white lateral tail stripes. In general the color\r\npattern and characters are remarkably uniform. Young specimens, while\r\nexhibiting the color pattern and general color of adults, are\r\nconspicuously less brown, and more grayish.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be little variation in color with season. In the series\r\nat hand, most specimens taken during the fall, winter, and spring are\r\nvery slightly browner than those of summer, suggesting that the fresh\r\npelage following the fall molt is a little brighter than is the pelage\r\nafter being worn all winter and into the following summer. But at most\r\nthe difference is slight.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL GLAND.\r\n\r\nUpon separating the hairs of the middle region of the back about a third\r\nof the distance between the ears and the rump, one uncovers a prominent\r\ngland, elliptical in outline, with long axis longitudinal and about 9\r\nmillimeters in length. The gland presents a roughened and granular\r\nappearance, and fewer hairs grow upon it than elsewhere on the back. The\r\nhairs in the vicinity are frequently matted, as if with a secretion. In\r\nworn stage of pelage the gland may be visible from above without\r\nseparating the hairs. Bailey has suggested that this functions as an oil\r\ngland for dressing the fur, and our observations bear out this view.\r\nKangaroo rats kept in captivity without earth or sand soon come to have\r\na bedraggled appearance, as if the pelage were moist. When supplied with\r\nfine, dusty sand, they soon recover their normal sleek appearance.\r\nApparently the former condition is due to an excess of oil, the latter\r\nto the absorption of the excess in a dust bath. The oil is doubtless an\r\nimportant adjunct to the preservation of the skin and hair amid the\r\ndusty surroundings in which the animal lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASUREMENTS AND WEIGHTS.\r\n\r\nExternal measurements include: _Total length_, from tip of nose to tip\r\nof tail without hairs, measured before skinning; _tail vertebræ_, length\r\nof tail from point in angle when tail is bent at right angles to body to\r\ntip of tail without hairs; and _hind foot_, from heel to tip of longest\r\nclaw.\r\n\r\nThe following are measurements of a series from the U. S. Range Reserve:\r\n\r\n     [Transcriber note: Next line was corrected per erratum. The\r\n     original text was of the following paragraph (_Averages for 17\r\n     adult females: Total length, 326.4 millimeters_).]\r\n\r\nAverage measurements of 30 adult specimens of both sexes: Total length,\r\n326.2 millimeters (349-310); tail vertebræ, 188.4 (208-180); hind foot,\r\n49.5 (51-47); the average weight of 29 adult specimens of both sexes was\r\n114.5 grams (131.9-98.0).\r\n\r\nAverages for 17 adult females: Total length, 326.4 millimeters\r\n(349-310); tail vertebræ, 188.8 (208-179); weight (16 individuals),\r\n113.7 (131.9-98.0); excluding pregnant females, 13 individuals averaged\r\n112.9 grams (131.9-98.0).\r\n\r\nAverages for 13 adult males: Total length, 326 millimeters (345-311);\r\ntail vertebræ, 187.8 (202-168); weight, 116.8 grams (129-100).\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no significant difference in the measurements and\r\nweights of males and females, with the possible exception of the\r\ncomparison of adult males and adult nonpregnant females.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOCCURRENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\n_Dipodomys spectabilis spectabilis_ is found in southeastern Arizona, in\r\nnorthwestern, central, and southern New Mexico, in extreme western\r\nTexas, in northern Sonora, and in northern and central Chihuahua (Fig.\r\n1). A subspecies, _D. s. cratodon_ Merriam, has been described from\r\nChicalote, Aguas Calientes, Mexico, the geographic range of which lies\r\nin central Mexico in portions of the States of Zacatecas, San Luis\r\nPotosi, and Aguas Calientes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITAT.\r\n\r\nIn the Tucson region _spectabilis_ is typically a resident of the Lower\r\nSonoran Zone. This is perhaps the principal zone inhabited over its\r\nentire range, but the animal is often found in the Upper Sonoran also,\r\nand in the Gallina Mountains of New Mexico Hollister found it invading\r\nthe yellow pine Transition where the soil was dry and sandy and the pine\r\nwoods of open character. The same observer found it common in grassy and\r\nweed-grown parks among the large junipers, pinyons, and scattering\r\nyellow pines of the Bear Spring Mountains, N. Mex. Bailey calls\r\nattention to the fact that the animal apparently does not inhabit the\r\nlower half of the Lower Sonoran Zone, as it extends neither into the Rio\r\nGrande Valley of Texas nor the Gila Valley of Arizona. In extreme\r\nwestern Texas it is common at the upper edge of the arid Lower Sonoran\r\nZone, and in this region does not enter the Upper Sonoran to any extent.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1914, Goldman found this kangaroo rat common on the plain at\r\n4,600 feet altitude, near Bonita, Graham County, Ariz., and noted a few\r\nas high as 5,000 feet altitude on the warm southwestern slopes of the\r\nGraham Mountains, near Fort Grant. Apparently _spectabilis_ reaches its\r\nupper altitude limit in the Burro Mountains, N. Mex., where Bailey has\r\nfound it sparingly on warm slopes up to 5,700 feet, and at the western\r\nbase of the Sandia Mountains, east of Albuquerque, N. Mex., where dens\r\noccur at approximately 6,000 feet.\r\n\r\nAbout Tucson it is undoubtedly more common in the somewhat higher\r\nportions of the Lower Sonoran Zone, above the _Covillea_ association,\r\nthan elsewhere (Pl. IV, Figs. 1 and 2). A few scattered dens are to be\r\nseen in the _Covillea_ belt, but as one rises to altitudes of 3,500 to\r\n4,000 feet, and the _Covillea_ is replaced by the cat's-claws (_Acacia_\r\nsp. and _Mimosa_ sp.) and scattered mesquite (_Prosopis_), with the\r\n_Opuntia_ becoming less abundant, kangaroo rat mounds come more and more\r\nin evidence. Here is to be found the principal grass growth supporting\r\nthe grazing industry, and the presence of a more luxuriant grass flora\r\nis probably an important factor in the greater abundance of kangaroo\r\nrats, both _spectabilis_ and _merriami_. In this generally preferred\r\nenvironment the desert hackberry (_Celtis pallida_) is one of the most\r\nconspicuous shrubs; clumps of this species are commonly accompanied by\r\nkangaroo rat mounds.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain whether the banner-tailed kangaroo rat has any\r\nmarked preference for building its mounds under _Celtis_ or some other\r\nparticular plant, all the observable mounds were counted in a strip\r\nabout 20 rods wide and approximately 4 miles long, an area of\r\napproximately 160 acres, particular note being taken of the kind of\r\nshrub under which each mound was located. Of 300 mounds in this area, 96\r\nwere under _Prosopis_, 95 under _Acacia_, 65 under _Celtis_, 11 under\r\n_Lycium_, 31 in the open, 1 about a \"cholla\" cactus (_Opuntia\r\nspinosior_), and 1 about a prickly pear (_Opuntia_ sp.). There is\r\napparently no strongly marked preference for any single species of\r\nplant. While both desert hackberry and the cat's-claws afford a\r\nbetter protection than mesquite--since cattle more often seek shade\r\nunder the latter, and in so doing frequently trample the mounds\r\nseverely--it appears that the general protection of a tree or shrub of\r\nsome sort is sought by kangaroo rats, rather than the specific\r\nprotection of the thickest or thorniest species.\r\n\r\nThe following records indicate particular habitat preferences of\r\n_spectabilis_ as noted at different points in its range:\r\n\r\n     Occurs on open bare knolls exposed to winds, also on gravelly\r\n     places at lower edge of foothills (Franklin Mountains, Tex., Gaut);\r\n     here and there over the barest and hardest of the gravelly mesas\r\n     (Bailey, Tex., 1905, 147); on open creosote-bush and giant-cactus\r\n     desert (Tucson, Ariz., Vorhies and Taylor); on firm, gravelly, or\r\n     even rocky soil on the grassy bajada land along the northwest base\r\n     of the mountains, either in the open or under _Celtis_, _Prosopis_,\r\n     _Lycium_, _Acacia greggii_, or other brush (Santa Rita Mountains,\r\n     Ariz., Vorhies and Taylor); mounds usually thrown up around a bunch\r\n     of cactus or mesquite brush (Magdalena, Sonora, Bailey); in heavy\r\n     soil (Ajo, Ariz., A. B. Howell); loamy soil (Gunsight, Ariz., A. B.\r\n     Howell); in mesa where not too stony (Magdalena, Sonora, Bailey);\r\n     grassy plain (Gallego, Chihuahua, Nelson); in open valley and high\r\n     open plains (Santa Rosa, N. Mex., Bailey); in grassy and weed-grown\r\n     parks among the larger junipers, pinyons, and scattering yellow\r\n     pines (Bear Spring Mountains, N. Mex., Hollister); on sand-dune\r\n     strip (east side of Pecos River, 15 miles northeast of Roswell, N.\r\n     Mex., Bailey); among _Ephedra_ patches (San Juan Valley, N. Mex.,\r\n     Birdseye); in open sandy soil along dry wash (Rio Alamosa, N. Mex.,\r\n     Goldman); on sides and crests of bare, stony hills (Mesa Jumanes,\r\n     N. Mex., Gaut); in open, arid part of the valley and stony mesas\r\n     (Carlsbad and Pecos Valley, N. Mex., Bailey); about the edges of\r\n     the plains of San Augustine and the foothills of the Datil and\r\n     Gallina Mountains, and in the Transition Zone yellow-pine forest of\r\n     the Gallina Mountains (Datil region, N. Mex., Hollister); on hard\r\n     limy ridges (Monahans, Tex., Cary).\r\n\r\nA. Brazier Howell notes that _spectabilis_ occurs in harder soil than\r\ndoes _deserti_. This observation is confirmed by others, and seems to\r\nafford a conspicuous habitat difference between the two, for _deserti_\r\nis typically an animal of the shifting aeolian sands.\r\n\r\nUsually, as on the Range Reserve, the rodents are widely distributed\r\nover a considerable area. Occasionally, as in the vicinity of Rio\r\nAlamosa, N. Mex., as reported by Goldman, they occur only in small\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.

These low, rounded mounds\r\noccupy an area of several feet in diameter, and rise to varying heights\r\nabove the general surface of the surrounding soil, the height depending\r\nrather more upon the character of the soil and the location of the mound\r\nas to exposure or protection than upon the area occupied by the burrow\r\nsystem which lies within and is the reason for the mound.\r\n\r\nA den in sandy soil in the open may be of maximum size in area occupied\r\nand yet scarcely present the appearance of a mound in any sense, due\r\nprobably both to the fact that the sandy soil will not heap up to such a\r\nheight over a honeycomb of tunnels as will a firmer or rocky soil, and\r\nalso to its greater exposure to the leveling action of rains and the\r\ntrampling of animals. These mounds are in themselves large enough to\r\nattract some attention, but their conspicuousness is enhanced by the\r\nfact that they are more or less completely denuded of vegetation and are\r\nthe centers of cleared areas often as much as 30 feet in diameter (Pl.\r\nV, Fig. 1); and further that from 3 to 12 large dark openings loom up in\r\nevery mound. The larger openings are of such size as to suggest the\r\npresence of a much larger animal than actually inhabits the mound. Add\r\nto the above the fact that the traveler by day never sees the mound\r\nbuilder, and we have the chief reasons why curiosity is so often aroused\r\nby these habitations.\r\n\r\nOn the Range Reserve the mounds are usually rendered conspicuous by the\r\nabsence of small vegetation, but Nelson writes that in the vicinity of\r\nGallego, Chihuahua, they can be readily distinguished at a distance\r\nbecause of a growth of weeds and small bushes over their summits, which\r\novertop the grass. In the vicinity of Albuquerque, N. Mex., Bailey\r\nreports (and this was recently confirmed by Vorhies) that the mounds\r\nabout the holes of _spectabilis_ are often hardly noticeable. Hollister\r\nwrites that in the yellow-pine forests of the Gallina Mountains the\r\nburrows are usually under the trunk of some fallen pine, both sides of\r\nit in some cases being taken up with holes, there being some eight or\r\nten entrances along each side, the burrows extending into the ground\r\nbeneath the log. In the vicinity of Blanco, N. Mex., Birdseye says that\r\noccasionally _spectabilis_ makes typical dens but more often lives in\r\nold prairie-dog holes (_Cynomys_), or in holes which look more like\r\nthose of _D. ordii_.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUNWAYS AND TRACKS.\r\n\r\nStill other features add to the interest in the dwelling places of\r\n_spectabilis_. Radiating in various directions from some of the openings\r\nof the mounds well-used runways are to be seen, some of them fading out\r\nin the surrounding vegetation, but others extending 30, 40, or even 50\r\nor more yards to neighboring burrows or mounds (Pl. V, Fig. 2; Pl. VI,\r\nFig. 1). These runways and the entrances to the mounds are well worn,\r\nshowing that the inhabitants are at home and are at some time of day\r\nvery active. The worn paths become most conspicuous in the autumnal\r\nharvest season, when they stand out in strong contrast to surrounding\r\ngrass. One usually finds not far distant from the main habitation one or\r\nmore smaller burrows, each with from one to three typical openings,\r\nconnected by the trail or runway system with the central den, and these\r\nwe have called \"subsidiary burrows\" (Pl. VI, Fig. 2). These will be\r\nagain referred to in discussing the detailed plan of the entire shelter\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nExamination of the runways and of the denuded area about a mound\r\ndiscloses an abundance of almost indecipherable tracks. The dust or sand\r\nis ordinarily much too dry and shifting to record clear footprints, and\r\nthere are no opportunities to see footprints of this species recorded in\r\ngood impressionable soil. Very characteristic traces of kangaroo rats\r\nmay be readily observed in the dust about the mounds, however, and these\r\nare long, narrow, sometimes curving, furrows made by the long tails as\r\nthe animals whisk about their work or play.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.

Bailey (1905, 148) is of the\r\nopinion that it is used as a signal of alarm, call note, or challenge, a\r\nview which the present authors believe to be correct. During the winter\r\nof 1920-21, however, both Bailey and Vorhies discovered that this sound,\r\nor a very similar one, is made by the rapid action of the forefeet in\r\ndigging. On one occasion in the laboratory the sound was given by one of\r\na pair and was responded to at once by the other, the two being in\r\nseparate but contiguous cages. This observation, however, could not be\r\nrepeated. (Vorhies MS.)\r\n\r\nOne evening, while working in the vicinity of the Burro Mountains, N.\r\nMex., Goldman heard a kangaroo rat near camp making this thumping noise.\r\nTaking a lantern, he approached the den, very cautiously, until within\r\n10 feet. The kangaroo rat was just outside the entrance of one of its\r\nburrows, and though moving about more or less restlessly at first showed\r\nlittle fear, and kept up the thumping or drumming at intervals. When\r\nmaking the noise the animal was standing with the forefeet on the ground\r\nand the tail lying extended. The noise seemed to be made with the hind\r\nfeet only, and the vibration of the feet could be seen. The tapping was\r\nkept up for a second or two at a time, the sounds coming close together\r\nand being repeated rhythmically after a very short interval, suggesting\r\nthe distant galloping of a horse. After continuing in this way for a\r\nshort time, the animal turned quickly about, with its head in the\r\nopposite direction, and began tapping. It appeared to pay little\r\nattention to the light, but finally gave a sudden bound and entered one\r\nof its holes about 4 feet from the one in front of which it had been\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nVorhies has repeatedly noted when watching for the appearance of a\r\nkangaroo rat at night that this sound invariably precedes the rodent's\r\nfirst emergence into the open, and often its appearance after an alarm,\r\nthough when the storage season has begun and the kangaroo rat is\r\ncarrying loads of grass heads or other material into its den, it\r\nregularly comes out without preliminary signaling. Vorhies has also\r\nobserved it making the sound while on top of the mound, and certainly\r\nnot digging, but was unable to see how it was made.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOICE.\r\n\r\nNo data concerning any call notes or sounds other than those described\r\nabove are at hand, with the following exception: Price (in Allen, 1895,\r\n213), who studied the habits of the animal in the moonlight, at Willcox,\r\nAriz., says that a low chuckle was uttered at intervals; and Vorhies has\r\nhad one captive female that would repeatedly utter a similar chuckle in\r\na peevish manner when disturbed by day, and one captive male which, when\r\nteased into a state of anger and excitement, would squeal much like a\r\ncornered house rat. Vorhies has spent many moonlight hours observing\r\nkangaroo rats, but without ever hearing a vocal sound uttered by free\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAILY AND SEASONAL ACTIVITY.\r\n\r\nThe kangaroo rat is strictly nocturnal. An observer watching patiently\r\nby a den in the evening for the animal's first appearance is not\r\nrewarded until darkness has fallen completely, and unless the moon is\r\nshining the animal can hardly be seen. Were it not for the white\r\ntail-brush of _spectabilis_ and its white belly when upright on the hind\r\nlegs and tail, one could not as a rule see the animal at all when it\r\nmakes its first evening appearance. With the first streak of dawn\r\nactivity usually ceases completely and much more abruptly than it began\r\nwith the coming of darkness, but on a recent occasion Vorhies observed\r\nthat a kangaroo rat which did not appear until near morning remained\r\nabove ground until quite light, but not fully daylight. On removal of\r\nthe plug from the mouth of a kangaroo rat burrow, one may sometimes see\r\na fresh mass of earth and refuse shoved into the opening from within. As\r\noften as not, however, even this unwelcome attention does not elicit any\r\nresponse by day, the great majority of the burrow openings of this\r\nspecies, as observed by the authors, remaining permanently open.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary activities of the kangaroo rat in southern Arizona can\r\nscarcely be said to show any true seasonal variation. The animals are\r\nactive all the year in this region, there being neither hibernation nor\r\nestivation, both perhaps being rendered unnecessary by the storage\r\nhabit, to be discussed in full later (pp. 15-16), and by the mildness of\r\nthe winter climate. On any particular night that the weather is rainy,\r\nor the ground too wet and cold, activity is confined to the interior of\r\nthe burrow system, and for this reason one has no opportunity to see a\r\nperfect imprint of the foot in freshly wet soil or in snow. On two or\r\nthree of the comparatively rare occasions on which there was a light\r\nfall of snow on the Range Reserve a search was made for tracks in the\r\nsnow. At these times, however, as on rainy nights, the only signs of\r\nactivity were the pushing or throwing out of fresh earth and food refuse\r\nfrom within the burrow. This is so common a sight as to be complete\r\nevidence that the animals are active within their dens during stormy\r\nweather but do not venture outside. Trapping has again and again proved\r\nto be useless on rainy nights, unless the rain is scant and a part of\r\nthe night favorable, in which case occasional individuals are taken.\r\nThese statements apply to the Range Reserve particularly; the facts may\r\nbe quite different where the animals experience more winter, as at\r\nAlbuquerque, N. Mex., although in November, 1921, Vorhies noted no\r\nindications of lessened activity in that region.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUGNACITY AND SOCIABILITY.\r\n\r\nSo far as their reactions toward man are concerned, kangaroo rats are\r\ngentle and make confiding and interesting pets; this is especially the\r\ncase with _merriami_. This characteristic is the more surprising in view\r\nof the fact that they will fight each other so readily and so viciously,\r\nand yet probably it is explained in part by their method of fighting.\r\nThey do not appear to use their teeth toward each other, but fight by\r\nleaping in the air and striking with the powerful hind feet, reminding\r\none most forcibly of a pair of game cocks, facing each other and\r\nguarding in the same manner. Sometimes they carry on a sparring match\r\nwith their fore feet. Biting, if done at all, is only a secondary means\r\nof combat. When taken in hand, even for the first time, they will use\r\ntheir teeth only in the event that they are wounded. The jaws are not\r\npowerful, and though the animals may lay hold of a bare finger, with the\r\napparent intention of biting, usually they do not succeed in drawing\r\nblood. As Bailey says (1905, 148), they are gentle and timid, and, like\r\nrabbits, depend upon flight and their burrows for protection.\r\n\r\nThe well-traveled trails elsewhere described (p. 10) indicate a degree\r\nof sociability difficult to explain in connection with their pugnacity\r\ntoward each other. While three or four individuals may sometimes be\r\ntrapped at a single mound, more than two are seldom so caught, and most\r\noften only one in one night. Trapping on successive nights at one mound\r\noften yields the larger number, yet in some cases the number is\r\nexplained by the fact that two or three nearly mature young are taken,\r\nand the capture of several individuals at a single mound can not be\r\ntaken to indicate that all are from the one den. Our investigations tend\r\nstrongly to the conclusion that only one adult occupies a mound, except\r\nduring the period when the young are in the parental (or maternal) den.\r\nIn the gassing and excavating of 25 or more mounds we have never found\r\nmore than one animal in a den, except in one instance, and then the two\r\npresent were obviously young animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSENSE DEVELOPMENTS.\r\n\r\nWithout making special investigations through a study of behavior or\r\nother special methods, one can speak in only general terms regarding\r\nwhat appear to be the special sense developments of kangaroo rats. The\r\neyes are large, as is very often the case in nocturnal animals, and when\r\nbrought out into the bright light of day the rats perhaps do not see\r\nwell. Yet, if an animal leaves a den which is in process of excavation,\r\nand follows one runway, even in bright sunlight, it makes excellent\r\nspeed to the next opening, often a distance of several yards. Whether\r\nthis is accomplished chiefly by the aid of sight or in large measure by\r\na maze-following ability, such as experiments have shown some rodents to\r\nhave, can not be stated without precise experimentation. Marked ability\r\nto follow a maze would not be at all surprising in view of the\r\nlabyrinthine character of the underground passages which make up the\r\nnormal habitation.\r\n\r\nWhen watching beside a mound by moonlight one is impressed with the fact\r\nthat the rats possess either a very keen sense of hearing or of sight,\r\nprobably both. The very slightest movement or noise on the part of the\r\nobserver results, with a timid individual, in an instantaneous leap for\r\nsafety, a disappearance into the burrow so sudden as to be almost\r\nstartling. All attempts to obtain flashlight photographs at the mounds\r\nwere failures, the animal either having gotten completely out of the\r\nfield before the light flashed following the pull of the trigger, or\r\nleaving merely an indistinguishable blur on the plate as it went, and\r\nthis in spite of carefully hiding the trigger chain behind a screen. A\r\nslight noise accompanying the trigger action gave the alarm in one case,\r\nand in another the length of time of the flash was sufficient for the\r\nget-away. The marvelous quickness of the animal clearly indicates a\r\nremarkably short reaction time. Occasionally a bold individual is\r\nfound, as in the case of one which came out repeatedly, even after being\r\nflashed twice in the same night.\r\n\r\nCertain peculiar physical characteristics suggest a relationship to\r\nsense reactions. On these, however, the authors are not prepared to do\r\nmore than offer suggestions for future work. The extremely large\r\nmastoids found in kangaroo rats suggest a connection in some way with\r\nspecial developments of the sense of hearing or of balance. It may be\r\nnoted that an intermediate condition between the kangaroo rats and the\r\nmajority of rodents in respect to this character is to be found in the\r\npocket mice (_Perognathus_), which belong to the same family. Herein\r\nlies a field for some interesting experimentation and discovery.\r\n\r\nThe small, pointed nose might suggest a not overkeen sense of smell, and\r\nthere appears no reason to believe that this sense is particularly well\r\ndeveloped. However, the turbinals are very complex. The vibrissæ are\r\nlong and sensitive, and may indicate a special development of the sense\r\nof touch as an adaptation to nocturnal habits and to life in an\r\nunderground labyrinth. The long, well-haired tail doubtless serves as an\r\nimportant tactile organ as well as a balance.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOVEMENTS AND ATTITUDES.\r\n\r\nMovements and attitudes are characteristic. As a kangaroo rat emerges\r\nfrom the burrow a reason for the relatively large size of the opening is\r\nseen in the fact that, kangaroolike, the animal maintains a partially\r\nupright position. Its ordinary mode of progression is hopping along on\r\nthe large hind legs, or, when in the open and going at speed, leaping.\r\nWhen moving slowly about over the mound, as if searching for food, it\r\nuses the fore legs in a kind of creeping movement. It appears to be\r\ncreeping when pocketing grain strewn about, but close observation shows\r\nthat the fore feet are then used for sweeping material into the pockets,\r\nreminding one somewhat of a vacuum cleaner. When it assumes a partially\r\nupright position the fore limbs are usually drawn up so closely that\r\nthey can be seen only by looking upward from a somewhat lower level than\r\nthat occupied by the animal. The slower movements of searching or\r\nplaying about the mound are occasionally interrupted by a sudden leap\r\ndirectly upward to a height of 1-1/2 to 2 feet, often with no apparent\r\nreason other than play. This is, however, a fighting or guarding\r\nmovement, though indulged in for play. The play instinct seems to be\r\nwell developed, and in evidence on any moonlight night when actual\r\nharvesting operations are not going on.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORING HABITS.\r\n\r\nProbably no instinct is of greater importance to the kangaroo rat than\r\nthat of storing food supplies. When a crop of desirable seeds is\r\nmaturing the animal's activities appear to be concentrated on this work.\r\nDuring September, 1919, when a good crop of grass seed was ripening\r\nfollowing the summer rains, a kangaroo rat under observation made\r\nrepeated round trips to the harvest field of grass heads. Each outward\r\ntrip occupied from 1 to 1-1/2 minutes, while the unloading trip into the\r\nburrow took only 15 to 20 seconds.\r\n\r\nOne individual in a laboratory cage, which had not yet been given a nest\r\nbox, busied itself in broad daylight in carrying its grain supply into\r\nthe darkest corner of the cage. When a nest box is supplied the\r\nindividual will retreat into its dark shelter, and will only come forth\r\nafter darkness has fallen unless forcibly ejected, but will store the\r\nfood supplied.\r\n\r\nIn another case an animal escaped while being handled, and sought refuge\r\nbehind a built-in laboratory table, where it could not be recovered\r\nwithout tearing out the table. For four days and nights it had the run\r\nof the laboratory. On the first night of its freedom it found and\r\nentered a burlap bag of grass seed that had been taken from a mound. A\r\ntrail of seed and chaff next morning showed that it had been busily\r\nengaged in making its new quarters comfortable with bedding and food.\r\nAfter four nights of freedom it was captured alive in a trap, and later\r\nit was found that it had moved from the corner behind the table to the\r\nspace beneath a near-by drawer, where it had stored about 2 quarts of\r\nthe grass seed and a handful of the oatmeal used for trap bait.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREEDING HABITS.\r\n\r\nObservations on breeding habits have consisted mainly in taking records\r\nfrom the females trapped at all seasons of the year throughout the\r\ncourse of the investigation, and from examinations made during poisoning\r\noperations, and yet from this source the number of pregnant females\r\ntaken or of young discovered is disappointingly small. The records\r\nindicate a breeding period of considerable length, extending from\r\nJanuary to August, inclusive. It is possible that the length of the\r\nperiod may be increased by a second litter from the earliest breeding\r\nfemales in summer, but the large percentage of nonpregnant or\r\nnonbreeding animals which occurs throughout the season would indicate a\r\nwide variation in the time of breeding of different individuals.\r\n\r\nTrapping in February and March for the purpose of securing greater\r\nnumbers of female specimens, begun with the idea that these months were\r\nmost likely to be the breeding months, has invariably yielded an\r\nunsatisfactory number of nonbreeding specimens and males. Unfortunately,\r\nthe numbers of females secured in some months were not sufficient to be\r\nsignificant if worked out in percentages of breeding and nonbreeding\r\nindividuals, and this, coupled with the fact that the importance of\r\nrecording carefully all nonbreeders was not at first recognized, makes\r\nit impossible to tabulate such information reliably. The total of\r\nfemales taken in April, for example, is only 3, of which 1 was breeding;\r\nwhile in June, during the course of poisoning operations, 45 females\r\nwere examined, of which 21 were breeding.\r\n\r\nFive breeding females were taken in January, all during the last three\r\ndays of the month. One of these was a suckling female, the young of\r\nwhich were secured alive and were probably at least a week old when\r\ntaken. This must have been exceptionally early for young, since of a\r\nnumber of adult kangaroo rats taken during the first week of January\r\nnone have been found to be breeding. Two records from Vernon Bailey are\r\nas follows: May 19-June 8, 1903, young specimen in nest (Santa Rosa, N.\r\nMex.); June 12, 1889, one female, two embryos (Oracle, Ariz.).\r\n\r\nThe considerable proportion (which we believe to be more than 50 per\r\ncent) of nonbreeding females taken during all those months in which\r\nbreeding has been found to occur may also indicate an extended period of\r\nbreeding, with a small percentage breeding at any one time. This period\r\nalso furnishes ample time for the rearing of two litters a year by some\r\nfemales, but we have no evidence as to the occurrence of two litters.\r\nYoung of the year, practically grown, are taken during and after the\r\nmonth of April.\r\n\r\nThe mammae are arranged in three pairs, pectoral, 1/1; inguinal, 2/2.\r\n\r\nKangaroo rats are among those rodents in which the vagina becomes\r\nplugged with a rather solid material, translucent, and of the\r\nconsistency of a stiff gelatine, after copulation. This must occur very\r\nsoon after coitus, since in those individuals taken in this condition no\r\ndefinite evidence of the beginning of development of embryos could be\r\ndetected by examination.\r\n\r\nThe length of the gestation period of _spectabilis_ is unknown. The\r\nyoung are born naked, a fact inferred by failure to find any fetus\r\nshowing noticeable hair development, and from the conditions observed in\r\nsuch young as have been seen. A suckling female was taken by Vorhies,\r\nJanuary 31, 1920, and her den immediately excavated in the hope of\r\nsecuring the young. Two juveniles were found in a special nest chamber\r\n(see p. 30). These were estimated to be perhaps two weeks old. A serious\r\neffort was made to raise the little animals by feeding milk with a\r\npipette and keeping them warm with a hot water bottle, but they survived\r\nonly 10 days, without the eyes having opened. The uneven temperature as\r\nwell as the character of the food was probably responsible for their\r\ndeaths. On February 3 they were measured and weighed, with the following\r\nresults:\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n         |         | Measurements (in millimetres).\r\n         | Weight  |-------------------------------\r\n         | (in     | Total   | Tail       | Hind\r\n         | grams). | length. | vertebrae. | foot.\r\n---------|---------|---------|------------|--------\r\nNo. 1    | 13.3    |   90    |     38     |  24\r\nNo. 2    | 12.6    |   93    |     38     |  24\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAt this stage the young were partially clothed with a coat of fine\r\nvelvety fur, more especially on the bodies, the tails being still nearly\r\nnaked. The body color was dark plumbeous, just the color of the dark\r\nunderfur of the adult, or a shade darker, while the characteristic white\r\nmarkings of the adult stood out sharply as pinkish-white areas against\r\nthe dark background (see Pl. IX, Fig. 2, at p. 32). The proportions were\r\nmuch as in the adult, except that the tails were relatively much shorter\r\nand the feet relatively longer.\r\n\r\nOnly one other record of young is at hand, that by Bailey, who secured\r\nthe young after capture of a suckling female at Santa Rosa, N. Mex. In\r\nthis case the litter contained only one. This was squeaking when found,\r\nbut was not large enough to crawl away. Its eyes and ears were closed,\r\nand its soft, naked skin was distinctly marked with the pattern of the\r\nadult, the colors being as given for the other two. This juvenile lived\r\nonly a week. Young less than half grown were not trapped or noted in our\r\npoisoning operations outside the dens.\r\n\r\nKangaroo rats, if _spectabilis_ be representative, reproduce at a slow\r\nrate as compared with many other small rodents. We have records of 67\r\nfemales with embryos or scars showing the number produced, and of the\r\ntwo litters of young described above. Of the 69 females thus recorded,\r\n15, or 21.7 per cent, had but one offspring each; 52, or 75.3 per cent,\r\nbut two each; while only 2 individuals, or 2.9 per cent, had three.\r\nThree young is the maximum litter recorded. This, taken in connection\r\nwith the protracted breeding season and lack of sure evidence of the\r\nproduction of two broods a year, gives a surprisingly low rate of\r\nreproduction, indicating relative freedom from inimical factors.\r\n\r\nOur breeding records for _merriami_ are fewer than for _spectabilis_,\r\nbut are very similar in every way so far as they go, both as to the time\r\nof year and number of young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD AND STORAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dipodomys s. spectabilis_ does not hibernate, so must prepare for\r\nunfavorable seasons by extensive storage of food materials. There are\r\ntwo seasons of the year, in southeastern Arizona at least, when storage\r\nof food takes place, namely, in spring, during April or May, and in\r\nfall, from September to November, the latter being the more important.\r\nFor the periods between, the animal must rely largely on stored\r\nmaterials. Not infrequently a season of severe drought precludes the\r\npossibility of any storage. The summer and fall of 1918 was such a\r\nseason on the Range Reserve (Pl. II, Fig. 2). If food stores are\r\ninadequate at such a time the kangaroo rats must perish in considerable\r\nnumbers. Fisher found many deserted mounds in the vicinity of Dos\r\nCabezos, Ariz., in June, 1894, which may be accounted for in this way.\r\nIn 1921 Vorhies found all mounds within 4 or 5 miles of Albuquerque, N.\r\nMex., deserted by _spectabilis_, resulting probably from overgrazing by\r\nsheep and goats during a succession of dry years. In the arid Southwest\r\nnatural selection probably favors the animals with the largest food\r\nstores, and it is not surprising that the storing habit has been\r\ndeveloped to a remarkable degree.\r\n\r\nSome stored material is likely to be found at any time of year in any\r\nmound examined, the largest quantity usually in fall and winter, the\r\nsmallest in July or August (Table 1, dens 1, 2, 14, and 24). Amounts\r\nfound by different observers vary from a few ounces to several quarts or\r\npecks, and stored materials taken from 22 mounds on the Range Reserve\r\nvary in weight from 5 to 4,127 grams (more than 9 pounds). This is\r\nexceeded by one lot from New Mexico, which totaled 5,750 grams (12.67\r\npounds). It is fairly evident that in seasons of scanty forage for stock\r\nthe appropriation of such quantities of grass seeds and crowns and other\r\ngrazing materials by numerous kangaroo rats may appreciably reduce the\r\ncarrying capacity of the range. Studies of cheek-pouch contents and food\r\nstores taken from dens show that the natural food of _spectabilis_\r\nconsists principally of various seeds and fruits, particularly the seeds\r\nof certain grasses. The study of burrow contents has been especially\r\nilluminating and valuable.\r\n\r\nAll of the stored material from 22 dens on the Range Reserve and from 2\r\nnear Albuquerque, N. Mex., has been saved and analyzed as to species as\r\ncarefully as the conditions of storage would permit. Within the mound\r\nthe food stored is usually more or less segregated by plant species,\r\nthough the stores of material of any one kind may be found in several\r\nplaces through the mound, and often the material is mixed. In the latter\r\ncase the quantities of the various species can only be estimated, but in\r\nthe former the species may be kept separate by the use of several bags\r\nfor collecting the seeds, and a fairly accurate laboratory weighing can\r\nbe made later. Very frequently, the explanation of this separation of\r\nspecies lies in the different seasons of ripening, but sometimes where\r\ntwo species are ripe at the same time near the mound, one is worked upon\r\nfor a time to the exclusion of the other. The one kind is often packed\r\nin tightly against the other, but with a very abrupt change in the\r\ncharacter of the material.\r\n\r\nA number of the more interesting and representative results of the\r\nweighing and analyses of burrow contents are presented herewith in\r\ntabular form. The data for each den, or lot, shows in grams the quantity\r\nof stored material removed and the best estimate it was possible to make\r\nof the percentages or weights of the various species. When the weight\r\nwas less than 5 grams, the mere trace of the species frequently is\r\nindicated in the following tables by the abbreviation \"Tr.\"\r\n\r\nTABLE 1.--_Analyses of plants stored by _Dipodomys spectabilis\r\nspectabilis_ Merriam, obtained from examination of representative dens\r\n(all except Den 24 from U.

The heads of _Sporobolus cryptandrus strictus_\r\nare retained to a great extent within the leaf sheaths.

Close examination, however, discloses the heads within, and\r\nshows that as in other instances seed storage is the end sought. These\r\npieces are packed beautifully parallel like so many matches, and vary\r\nfrom a minimum length of 20 to a maximum of 37 millimeters, averaging\r\nabout 30. Count of 2 grams of the above _Sporobolus_ material shows that\r\nthere are 125 separate cut sections per gram, or a total of\r\napproximately 680,000 pieces in this one lot of storage, indicating a\r\nremarkable activity on the part of the individual rat (Pl.

From about February to April a decrease may be noted,\r\nfollowed, if the spring growth of annuals be good, by a slight increase;\r\nand we can very nearly predict the general character of the increases\r\nand decreases by the precipitation and consequent growth conditions.\r\n\r\nTABLE 2.--_Quantity of storage per den correlated with time of year and\r\ngrowth conditions of preceding season (chiefly from United States Range\r\nReserve near the Santa Rita Mountains, Ariz.)._\r\n\r\n------------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n            |           |           |\r\n Den No.    | Date.     | Quantity. | Preceding\r\n            |           |           | season.\r\n            |           |           |\r\n------------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n            |   1918.   | _Grams._  |\r\n            |           |           |\r\n 1          | Feb. 7    |    4,127  |  Good.\r\n 2          | Mar. 9    |    3,615  |    Do.\r\n 3          | July 25   |      401  |  Poor.\r\n 4          | Sept. 20  |      734  |    Do.\r\n 5          | Sept. 21  |    2,520  |    Do.\r\n 6          | Oct. 17   |    2,315  |    Do.\r\n 7          | Dec. 20   |    1,247  |    Do.\r\n            |           |           |\r\n            |   1919.   |           |\r\n            |           |           |\r\n 8          | Feb. 7    |    1,600  |    Do.\r\n 9          | Mar. 13   |      370  |    Do.\r\n 10         | Apr. 7    |      180  |    Do.[3]\r\n 11         | Apr. 9    |      117  |  Good.[3]\r\n 12         | May 7     |      298  |    Do.[3]\r\n 13         | May 11    |    1,590  |    Do.\r\n 14         | Aug. 8    |        5  |  Good.\r\n 15         | Sept. 4   |      151  |    Do.\r\n 16         | Oct. 17   |      313  |    Do.\r\n 17         | Oct. 18   |      583  |    Do.\r\n 18         | Oct. 25   |    3,410  |    Do.\r\n 19         | Nov. 1    |    3,026  |    Do.\r\n 20         | Dec. 13   |    2,816  |    Do.\r\n            |           |           |\r\n            |   1920.   |           |\r\n            |           |           |\r\n 21         | Jan. 31   |    1,173  |    Do.\r\n            |           |           |\r\n            |   1921.   |           |\r\n            |           |           |\r\n 22         | Jan. 1    |    2,333  |  Fair.\r\n 23[4]      | Nov. 7    |    1,685  |  Good.\r\n 24[4]      | Nov. 8    |    5,750  |    Do.\r\n            |           |           |\r\n------------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: Changing from poor summer season of 1918 to excellent\r\n    spring growth of 1919.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: From near the Sandia Mountains, N.

The spring season is the\r\nless important, the plants consisting chiefly of a variety of small\r\nannuals, while the important range grasses make their chief growth and\r\nhead out almost exclusively in the July-August rainy season. It may be\r\nnoted also that the actual increases in storage appear somewhat after\r\nthe growth period proper, since storing does not get well under way\r\nuntil the seed crop is mature. The banner-tailed kangaroo rat shows a\r\nmarked adaptability to different foods available in the neighborhood of\r\nits burrows. It must, perforce, adapt itself and its storage program to\r\nthe food that it can get, and this varies enormously with the climatic\r\nconditions of successive seasons. The large numbers present in suitable\r\nlocalities clearly indicate that the animal is successful in meeting the\r\nchanging and sometimes extremely adverse conditions of its environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII. FIG. 1.--CONTENT OF DEN EXCAVATED IN NEW MEXICO.\r\n\r\nStorage content of Den No. 24, of Table 1, from Sandia Mountains, N.\r\nMex. This is the largest lot of storage taken in the course of the\r\ninvestigations. The larger pile consists wholly of a valuable grass,\r\n_Sporobolus cryptandrus strictus_: the smaller of Russian thistle\r\n(_Salsola pestifer._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII. FIG. 2.--GROWTH FOLLOWING ELIMINATION OF\r\nKANGAROO RATS.\r\n\r\nThe same mound as shown in Plate III, Figure 1, after three years of\r\nprotection, the rodents having been killed out. Nearly as good grass\r\nrecovery following poisoning operations occurred in the single excellent\r\nseason of 1921.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt times, more especially in the seasons of active growth, some of the\r\ngreen and succulent portions of plants are eaten. This was very\r\nnoticeable in the spring of 1919, when a most luxuriant growth of\r\nMexican poppy (_Eschscholtzia mexicana_) occurred. Stomachs at this time\r\nwere filled with the yellow and green mixture undoubtedly produced by\r\nthe grinding up of the buds and flowers of this plant. Small caches of\r\nabout a tablespoonful of these buds were also found in the burrows at\r\nthis time. Occasionally in spring one may find a few green leaves of\r\nvarious plants, _Gaertneria_ very commonly, tucked away in small pockets\r\nalong the underground tunnels, indicating that such materials are used\r\nto some extent. As has been shown in detail, however (Table 1), the\r\nchief storage, and undoubtedly the chief food, consists of air-dry\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\nThe character of the storage, the absence of rain for months at a time\r\nin some years, and the consequent failure of green succulents show that\r\nwithout doubt _spectabilis_ possesses remarkable power, as to its water\r\nrequirements, of existing largely if not wholly upon the water derived\r\nfrom air-dry starchy foods, i.e., metabolic water serves it in lieu of\r\ndrink (Nelson, 1918, 400), this being formed in considerable quantities\r\nby oxidation of carbohydrates and fats (Babcock, 1912, 159, 170). During\r\nthe long dry periods characteristic of southern Arizona, no evidence\r\nthat the animal seeks a supply of succulent food, as cactus, is found;\r\nand if it may go for two, three, or six months without water or\r\nsucculent food, it is reasonable to suppose that it may do so\r\nindefinitely. In the laboratory _spectabilis_ ordinarily does not drink,\r\nbut rather shows a dislike for getting its nose wet. During the periods\r\nof drought the attacks upon the cactuses by other rodents of the same\r\nregion, as _Lepus_, _Sylvilagus_, _Neotoma_, and _Ammospermophilus_,\r\nbecome increasingly evident. The list of plant species thus far found\r\nrepresented in the storage materials of _spectabilis_ on the Range\r\nReserve is shown in Table 3.\r\n\r\nTABLE 3.--_List of all plant species found in 22 dens of _Dipodomys\r\nspectabilis_ on the United States Range Reserve, near the Santa Rita\r\nMountains, Ariz., with approximate total weights._\r\n\r\n          GRASSES.\r\n                                                                   Grams.\r\nAristida bromoides (six-weeks needlegrass)                           536\r\nAristida divaricata (Humboldt needlegrass)                         9,412\r\nAristida scabra (rough needlegrass)                                  344\r\nBouteloua aristidoides (six-weeks grama)                           3,093\r\nBouteloua radicosa (grama)                                         1,269\r\nBouteloua eriopoda (black grama)                                     Tr.\r\nBouteloua rothrockii (seeds, 8,495; crowns, 3,517 grams)\r\n    (crowfoot grama)                                              12,012\r\nFestuca octoflora (fescue grass)                                      70\r\nPanicum arizonicum (Arizona panic-grass)                              11\r\nPanicum hallii (Hall panic-grass)                                    Tr.\r\nPappaphorum wrightii                                                 Tr.\r\nTridens pulchella                                                    Tr.\r\nValota saccharata                                                    Tr.\r\n\r\n            OTHER PLANTS.\r\n\r\nAlternanthera repens                                                 Tr.\r\nAnisolotus trispermus (bird's-foot trefoil)                          186\r\nAplopappus gracilis                                                1,030\r\nApodanthera undulata (melon loco)                                     55\r\nAstragalus nuttallianus (milk vetch)                                 630\r\nAyenia microphylla                                                   Tr.\r\nBoerhaavia wrightii                                                  885\r\nChamaecrista leptadenia (partridge pea)                                5\r\nEchinocactus wislizeni (visnaga)                                       5\r\nEriogonum polycladon                                                  35\r\nEschscholtzia mexicana (Mexican poppy)                               250\r\nGaertneria tenuifolia (franseria)                                    Tr.\r\nCollomia gracilis (false gilia)                                      Tr.\r\nHeterotheca subaxillaris                                             Tr.\r\nKallstroemia laetevirens                                             Tr.\r\nLupinus sparsiflorus (lupine)                                        Tr.\r\nMartynia altheaefolia (small devil's-horns)                           12\r\nMollugo verticillata (carpetweed)                                    324\r\nOenothera primiverus (evening primrose)                               15\r\nOpuntia discata (prickly pear)                                        15\r\nLoeflingia pusilla                                                   Tr.\r\nLepidium lasiocarpum (peppergrass)                                   Tr.\r\nPlantago ignota (plantain)                                           818\r\nPolygala puberula (milkwort)                                         Tr.\r\nPortulaca suffrutescens (purslane)                                   Tr.\r\nProsopis velutina (mesquite)                                       1,570\r\nSida diffusa (spreading sida)                                         30\r\nSolanum elaeagnifolium (742 fruits) (trompillo, prickly solanum)     156\r\nPuffballs and fleshy fungi (undetermined)                             12\r\n\r\n  Total species, exclusive of fungi, 41.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from Table 3 that while a large number of species of\r\nplants are represented in the totals from so many dens, a majority of\r\nthem are of very minor importance, and that the seeds of grasses are the\r\nprincipal storage and probably therefore the principal food material.\r\nSix of the most important species of grasses (disregarding species\r\nfurnishing less than 5 grams) comprise 85.6 per cent of the total weight\r\nof storage from 22 dens. Crowfoot grama (_Bouteloua rothrockii_) stands\r\nfirst in quantity in the total, forming 39.4 per cent of all stored\r\nmaterial, 46 per cent of the six important grasses, and 45 per cent of\r\nall grasses. The largest amount of storage of any one species of grass\r\nin any one den on the Range Reserve also is of this species, 2,205\r\ngrams[5] (Table 1, den 1, p. 20, and Pl. VII, Fig. 2). This is exceeded\r\nby a dropseed grass, _Sporobolus cryptandrus strictus_, which amounted\r\nto 5,455 grams in a lot from Albuquerque, N. Mex. (Table 1, den 24, and\r\nPl. VIII, Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: This amount of dry grama grass seed (heads) amounts to\r\n    approximately a bushel.]\r\n\r\nOf the species other than grasses found stored in these dens, mesquite\r\nbeans (_Prosopis velutina_) are most important both by weight and number\r\nof dens containing them. The total for the 22 Range Reserve dens is\r\n1,570 grams, or 35.9 per cent of the seeds other than grasses, but only\r\n5.1 per cent of the total storage. In bulk mesquite beans do not loom up\r\nlarge, as they are probably the heaviest material stored. Sections of\r\npods which must have been dragged into the burrows are found, some of\r\nthem certainly being much too long for carriage in the pouches. The\r\nspecies of plant other than grass found in the largest quantity in any\r\none den, however, was _Aplopappus gracilis_, not recorded in quantity\r\nfrom any den until the excavation of the twenty-second, and then found\r\nin a very large bulk of soft, fluffy material, with most of the seeds\r\nseparated from the heads, and weighing 1,030 grams (Table 1, den 22).\r\n\r\nAny of the food materials above listed are likely to be found in the\r\ncheek pouches, while in addition such extraneous matter as stones and\r\nfeces have also been found. All species of plants stored are accessible\r\nin the immediate vicinity of the mound, and when any particular plant is\r\nfound seeding in abundance in the vicinity of the den it is likely to be\r\nrepresented in the storage. Usually the animals can be readily trapped\r\nwith almost any kind of grain bait, as oats, rolled oats, rolled barley,\r\nand wheat; and nut meats also are attractive, though we have no record\r\nof the storing of any true nut in the dens, such not being available in\r\nthe range of the animal on the Range Reserve.\r\n\r\nThe following plants not represented in the list stored by the kangaroo\r\nrat on the Range Reserve have been found in the cheek pouches or mounds\r\nof _spectabilis_ in other localities:\r\n\r\n     _Amaranthus palmeri_, _Sesuvium portulacastrum_, and _Atriplex\r\n     wrightii_ (alluvial soil of Santa Cruz Valley, Continental, Ariz.,\r\n     Bailey).\r\n\r\n     Cut leaves and stems of a small sagebrush (Franklin Mountains,\r\n     Tex., Gaut).\r\n\r\n     _Gutierrezia_ heads (San Juan Valley, N. Mex., Birdseye).\r\n\r\n     _Verbesina enceliodes_, _Portulaca oleracea_, _Bouteloua gracilis_,\r\n     and _Munroa squarrosa_ (Rio Alamosa, N. Mex., Goldman).\r\n\r\n     Tops of buds of _Artemisia filifolia_ (Mesa Jumanes, N. Mex.,\r\n     Gaut).\r\n\r\n     Tumbleweed (_Amaranthus graecizans_), Russian thistle (_Salsola\r\n     pestifer_), _Munroa squarrosa_, and _Sporobolus cryptandrus\r\n     strictus_ (Sandia Mountains, Albuquerque, N. Mex., Vorhies).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURROW SYSTEMS, OR DENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe burrow system, or den, in which _spectabilis_ stores its caches of\r\nfood materials, has its nest, and remains throughout the hours of\r\ndaylight is a complicated labyrinth of tunnels. Ejection of refuse and\r\nsoil from this retreat builds up the mound frequently referred to. These\r\nmounds are, as Bailey says, characteristic of the species, and are as\r\nunmistakable as muskrat houses or beaver dams, and as carefully planned\r\nand built for as definite a purpose--home and shelter. They are,\r\nfurthermore, the most notable of all kangaroo rat dwelling places\r\n(Nelson, 1918, 400). They range in height from 6 inches to approximately\r\n4 feet and from 5 to 15 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe mound is built up not only through the cleaning out of chaff and\r\nother food refuse, but through extension and modification of the\r\ntunnels; old tunnels, entrances, and caches of musty food material are\r\nfrom time to time closed up and others excavated, repair and rebuilding\r\nbeing especially necessary after the collapse of portions of the den as\r\na result of heavy rains or trampling by cattle. Ejected material is most\r\ncommonly simply thrown out fan-wise from the openings, without much\r\napparent effort to add to the height of the mound.\r\n\r\nThere are usually from 6 to 12 entrance holes in each mound opening into\r\nthe subterranean burrow system, each hole from 4 to 5-1/2 inches in\r\ndiameter. These holes are nearly all situated a little above the surface\r\nof the surrounding soil, and as Price has suggested (in Allen, 1895,\r\n213), this is doubtless a wise provision against flooding, as torrential\r\nrains sometimes occur in the kangaroo rat country.\r\n\r\nBoth Bailey and Nelson state that as a rule several of the holes are\r\nclosed with sand or miscellaneous earth and old storage material during\r\nthe daytime, but our observations on the Range Reserve are that such\r\nclosing is only occasional. Many occupied dens have not a single\r\nopening closed. Further, night observations disclose that the inhabitant\r\nof the mound will appear from some one of the two or three most-used\r\nopenings when night falls, and not necessarily from one which has been\r\nclosed by day. Recently an opening closed one day was observed in use\r\nduring the night, but was left open all the next day.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to determine whether there exist similarities of plan or\r\nsystem in the dens, it was considered advisable to map them with some\r\ndegree of accuracy. This we were enabled to do by laying off a square\r\nabout a given mound, 2-1/2 or 3 meters each way, and subdividing it into\r\na series of small squares of half a meter on each side by drawing\r\ncross-lines on the surface of the ground over the top of the mound. One\r\nperson then did the digging and exploring of the tunnels, as to\r\ndirection and depth, while the other noted the results on coordinate\r\npaper (Figs. 2 and 3); the proper excavation and mapping of one of these\r\nworkings occupied from four to eight hours for the two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Diagram of a typical den of _Dipodomys\r\nspectabilis spectabilis_. Double shading indicates where one portion of\r\ntunnel lies above another and solid black a three-story arrangement;\r\n_A_, _B_, _C_, etc., active openings to surface; figures without arrows,\r\ndepths in centimeters to tunnel roofs; figures with arrows, tunnel\r\nwidths in centimeters; _N._ nest chamber; _S_, storage; _OS_, old\r\nstorage; _Y_, probably an old nest chamber; _Z_, old, unused, or\r\npartially plugged openings.]\r\n\r\nWhile there is greater complexity in the larger, and probably older,\r\nmounds than in the smaller, all are extremely complicated and can only\r\nbe described as labyrinthine in character. The tunnels wind about\r\nthrough the mound, rising and falling in vertical depth,\r\nintercommunicating frequently, but with occasional cul-de-sacs, and in\r\nplaces expanding into chambers, of which there may be three or four\r\nlarge ones. The stored materials are found in some, but not necessarily\r\nall, of these chambers, and may also occupy considerable lengths of\r\nordinary tunnel, especially when the quantity present is large. Small\r\nevaginations of the tunnels frequently contain lesser caches, and it is\r\nin such pockets that bits of fresh material are placed during a growing\r\nseason, or that grain supplied the previous night for bait is usually\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe main masses of storage are most often found centrally located at\r\ndepths of from 15 to 57 centimeters, although at times one may find a\r\ncache near the periphery of the system and as near the surface as 2 or 3\r\ncentimeters. In the latter case the materials are subject to wetting\r\nfrom rains, and consequent spoilage.\r\n\r\nThe major portion of the whole tunnel system is within about 50\r\ncentimeters of the surface of the mound, but usually some one branch\r\ntunnel goes to somewhat greater depth, and this is likely to be the one\r\ncontaining the nest; this is also likely to extend toward or beyond the\r\nperiphery of the main system, and always ends blindly. Such a one, from\r\nwhich two young were taken on January 31, 1920, was at a depth of about\r\n65 centimeters, and about 1-1/2 meters beyond the periphery of the mound\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe individual tunnels average about 8 centimeters in height, and about\r\n11 centimeters in width, though the variation, especially in width, is\r\nconsiderable. The expansions mentioned as being the chief places of\r\nstorage are from 15 to 25 centimeters in diameter, and may or may not\r\ninvolve a considerable increase in height. They are frequently located\r\nat junction points of two or more branches of the tunnel system.\r\n\r\nThe nest cavity is a chamber of approximately spherical shape and from\r\n17 to 23 centimeters in diameter. Chambers of this character were\r\nobserved and noted as \"old storage\" in a number of cases. They were\r\nsometimes cut off from the rest of the habitation, and at first were\r\nsupposed to contain abandoned musty storage. As experience in excavating\r\nand interpreting results has been gained we have concluded that these\r\nchambers in fact represent abandoned nests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Diagram of the system of surface runways and\r\nsubsidiary dens of _Dipodomys spectabilis spectabilis_. The underground\r\ntunnels of the main den were too complicated to illustrate on this\r\nscale, being very similar to those of Figure 2. The underground tunnels\r\nof the subsidiaries are shown in solid black. Some runways fade out in\r\nthe grass in a manner that can not be indicated in a line drawing.]\r\n\r\nBailey gives the dimensions of nest chambers observed in New Mexico as\r\nabout 6 by 8 inches to 8 by 10 inches. The nest is composed of finer,\r\nsofter, and more chaffy material than the regular storage. The chaff\r\nrefuse from the food probably contributes largely to it, though some\r\nleaves of grasses not stored for food may also be found, and a nest,\r\nespecially the one in use, may be distinguished, if excavating is\r\ncarefully done, by the distinct cavity about the size of a fist in its\r\ninterior (Pl. IX, Fig. 1). One may sometimes find this cavity distinctly\r\nwarm from the recent presence of the inhabitant.\r\n\r\nThe walls or partitions between the chambers and tunnels are in places\r\nsurprisingly thin, and it is no wonder that one is almost certain to\r\nbreak through in stepping on a mound, since the whole is a honeycomblike\r\nstructure of from two to four stories in vertical plan, as shown by the\r\ntransect of a mound in Plate VII, Figure 1. As Bailey writes, these\r\npartition walls are a mixture of earth and old food and nest material\r\ndiscarded years ago, resembling the adobe walls of the Mexican houses\r\nbuilt of chopped earth and straw. This is the result of the continual\r\nejection of refuse and earth as before mentioned, combined with the\r\ncaving action of rains and disturbances from larger animals.\r\n\r\nApparently there are no special pockets for deposit of feces in\r\n_Dipodomys_ burrows; such matter may be found throughout the den, and is\r\nmore or less mixed with the food refuse which carpets practically the\r\nentire tunnel system. The nest and food stores are, however, clean and\r\nneat, the droppings being dry and, though present on the floor of a\r\nstorage chamber, not actually mingled with the food. Evidently the\r\nanimal does not clean up the floor litter before storing food material.\r\n\r\nThe entire system for any one den seems to consist not only of the\r\nburrows within the mound itself, as described, but of those small\r\noutlying ones which we have referred to as subsidiary burrows. These are\r\ntwo to four in number, and are connected with the main mound by the\r\nrunways already mentioned. They often seem to be way stations on the\r\nrunways connecting main mounds, and there is seldom any mound of earth\r\nwhatever in connection with them. One entire den system, the home mound\r\nand three subsidiaries, was mapped after being excavated (Fig. 3), all\r\nhaving been carefully gassed with carbon bisulphide. The subsidiaries\r\nwere simple and contained no storage. Two of them were shallow, while in\r\nthe third a depth of 48 centimeters was reached. They appear to be\r\nmerely places of refuge, though the well-worn trails connecting them\r\nwith the main mound indicate regular use. These runways are conspicuous\r\non the Range Reserve, and are apparently characteristic of mounds\r\nthroughout the range of the animal. Dwellers in different mounds must\r\nhave rather extensive social contacts, notwithstanding the enmity of\r\nindividuals toward each other in captivity. The main mound, in this\r\ninstance very complicated, was in one place three stories high, and we\r\nhave found as many as four utilized stories; but as a rule there are two\r\nor three only.\r\n\r\nSince collapses are rather frequent during rainy seasons, aside from the\r\ntrampling previously referred to, the kangaroo rats, where abundant,\r\nas on the Range Reserve, may well be a factor in increasing soil\r\nporosity and fertility; for in the course of time they probably have\r\nsucceeded in plowing and cultivating the whole surface layer of the\r\nsoil. They may thus be a factor in ecologic succession, tending to\r\nimprove the character of the soil and adapt it to another stage.\r\n\r\nDoubtless their own workings afford the only shelter the animals know.\r\nIn the course of our digging in one mound, the occupant, an adult male,\r\ndid not forsake the den until the excavation was three-fourths\r\ncompleted; and even then it did not leave by a burrow leading away from\r\nour operations, but came toward us, escaped the active efforts of four\r\nindividuals bent on its capture, and ran speedily along a used runway\r\ntoward another burrow several meters distant. A sack had been stuffed in\r\nthe mouth of this, however, and, baffled, the rat then returned to the\r\noriginal burrow and was captured. Observations on other rats thus driven\r\nfrom the home mound indicate that they are very familiar with the\r\nrunways of the vicinity of the mound and the various subsidiary burrows,\r\nand it is a question whether they need to see clearly to follow these\r\nruns. Apparently they never attempt to escape by forsaking their\r\nwell-traveled runways. Tests of the maze-running ability of these\r\nanimals by animal-behavior experts would be of extraordinary interest,\r\nin view of the character of the homes which they always inhabit and the\r\nnetwork of runs on the outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX. FIG. 1.--KANGAROO RAT NEST AND YOUNG.\r\n\r\nNest and the two young, the ordinary number in the litter, of _Dipodomys\r\ns. spectabilis_, taken from den on January 31, 1920.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX. FIG. 2.--YOUNG OF THE KANGAROO RAT.\r\n\r\nThe same young as shown in Figure 1, above. They were probably about two\r\nweeks old, the pelage being short but with the white markings of the\r\nadult; the tails are relatively short and with scarcely any hair.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENSALS AND ENEMIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENSALS.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether any animals live in a truly commensal\r\nrelationship with _spectabilis_, but of not unfriendly associates there\r\nare a great number. It is the experience of Bailey, corroborated by\r\nobservations of Vorhies on living animals, that these kangaroo rats are\r\nactive in defending their caches of food, and will even fight\r\nindividuals of the same species savagely and to the death. One moonlight\r\nnight a strange individual was liberated on a mound. It deliberately\r\nentered one of the openings, but after about two minutes' time made an\r\nexceedingly rapid exit, running rapidly out of sight as if pursued,\r\nthough the owner of the home did not appear outside of the burrow. There\r\ncan be little doubt that the stranger was precipitately ejected by the\r\nowner. We suspect, though this is a point difficult to prove\r\nsatisfactorily, that _merriami_ does not always store food supplies for\r\nitself, but visits the burrows of _spectabilis_ regularly to pilfer the\r\nseed stored therein. The observed facts thus far recorded which suggest\r\nthis are that in no _merriami_ burrow examined has a store of food been\r\nfound, and also that in trapping for _spectabilis_ on its own\r\ncharacteristic mounds one catches a large percentage of _merriami_.\r\n\r\nOn two separate occasions Vorhies has observed the smaller species\r\nrunning over the mounds of the larger, actually carrying away the grain\r\nwhich had been placed to entice the larger when it might appear. (In\r\nthese cases the larger species did not put in an appearance until near\r\nmorning.) Furthermore, the dens of _merriami_ are often connected by\r\ndistinct runways with those of _spectabilis_, indicating much traveling\r\nor visiting. That this is probably not friendly visiting is suggested by\r\nthe certainty with which an individual of the larger species will strike\r\nand kill one of the smaller when they are placed together in the same\r\ninclosure. The word \"thief\" expresses this suspected relationship better\r\nthan would the term \"parasite.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not to be expected that such obvious shelter retreats as the\r\nmounds of _spectabilis_ should fail to attract the attention of other\r\nanimals. We have found a small gecko (_Coleonyx variegatus_), scorpions\r\nof two or three undetermined species, and certain insects (of the Order\r\nOrthoptera) to be very common inhabitants of the dens. With the\r\nexception of the parasitic insects the most common are wingless\r\nlocustids (_Ceuthophilus_ spp.) and the peculiar wingless females of a\r\nspecies of cockroach (_Arenivaga erratica_). These two are seldom absent\r\nwhen a burrow is excavated, the female cockroaches being abundant,\r\nalthough the winged males have never been taken in the burrows.\r\n\r\nCary's observations at Monahans, Tex., and those of others at numerous\r\nlocalities, combined with our own, show that at various times the dens\r\nfurnish protection and shelter for various species of cottontail rabbits\r\n(_Sylvilagus_), ground squirrels (_Citellus_ and _Ammospermophilus_),\r\nwood rats (_Neotoma_), grasshopper mice (_Onychomys_), rattlesnakes\r\n(_Crotalus_), and most of the common lizards. Of these the ground\r\nsquirrels _Citellus tereticaudus_ and _Ammospermophilus harrisii_ are\r\nmost often noted on the Range Reserve using the dens as a retreat, the\r\n_Ammospermophilus_ seldom being observed to enter any other kind of\r\nburrow. It should be added that the total observations include dens\r\nwhich have been deserted by their rightful owners.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL CHECKS.\r\n\r\nThe enemies of the kangaroo rat are not determined in detail, or as to\r\nrelative importance, but the badger (_Taxidea taxus berlandieri_) and\r\nthe kit fox, or swift (_Vulpes macrotis neomexicana_), may well be\r\nforemost. Dens which have been deeply excavated by badgers are\r\nfrequently seen, and sometimes two or three badger tunnels penetrate one\r\nburrow system. Dens thus despoiled are probably soon reoccupied even if\r\nthe original owner is captured, and in the course of a few months the\r\nreworking of the abode obliterates the signs of destruction.\r\n\r\nDroppings of the kit fox show an abundance of bones of small mammals of\r\nkangaroo rat size, among them those of _spectabilis_.\r\n\r\nBobcats (_Lynx baileyi_) and coyotes (_Canis mearnsi_) probably are a\r\nprejudicial factor. Skunks may sometimes be able to surprise the\r\nkangaroo rats, but probably not often. The western horned owl (_Bubo\r\nvirginianus pallescens_), the barn owl (_Tyto alba pratincola_), and\r\nperhaps others may well be among the most feared enemies, but no special\r\ninvestigation of owl pellets on the reserve has been possible. In 592\r\nbarn-owl pellets from California were found remains of 230 kangaroo\r\nrats, only one other rodent being represented by a larger number\r\n(McAtee, 1921, 258).\r\n\r\nMuch more information on enemies is needed. The relatively low rate of\r\nreproduction (see p. 18) indicates comparative freedom from inimical\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARASITES.\r\n\r\n_Dipodomys s. spectabilis_ is regularly infested with a species of flea,\r\n_Ctenophthalmus_ sp. Seldom or never is a specimen taken in reasonably\r\nfresh condition without some of these parasites present on its body,\r\nthough of course they desert the body of the host after it becomes cold,\r\nand hence dead specimens left too long may be free from them. The den\r\nconditions are ideal for the breeding of this parasite, because of the\r\ngreat quantities of fine, dusty, organic refuse littering the tunnels\r\nand furnishing food and refuge for the larvæ. As demonstrated to us by\r\nF. C. Bishopp, of the Bureau of Entomology, a handful of this refuse\r\ntaken from the floor of a burrow within arm's length of the entrance is\r\nalmost certain to contain these larvæ.\r\n\r\nLess regularly present, perhaps because of its different life history,\r\nis a small tick, _Trombicula_ sp. At times this parasite is very common,\r\nbeing present on nearly every individual rat, and at other times\r\nspecimens are difficult to find; it appears to be more commonly present\r\nin summer and fall than at other seasons, and is found attached chiefly\r\nto the ears.\r\n\r\nNo internal parasites have been detected. The nocturnal and fossorial\r\nhabits of the animal seem to give complete protection against a form of\r\nparasite which is very common among some other rodents of the Range\r\nReserve, notably _Lepus_ and _Sylvilagus_. Nearly all rabbits are\r\ninfested with \"warbles,\" the larvæ of a species of bot-fly, _Cuterebra_\r\n(family Oestridae). Other small mammals also are occasionally\r\nparasitized by the _Cuterebra_, but in the handling and examination of\r\nperhaps 200 or more individuals of _spectabilis_ and _merriami_, we have\r\nyet to find a single case of infestation by an oestrid fly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABUNDANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne's first impression of a well-occupied _spectabilis_ area is that a\r\nlarge family must inhabit each den, but, as previously mentioned, we\r\nhave gradually been compelled to shift from this conception to the idea\r\nof but a single animal to a mound, except when the young are present.\r\nTherefore a census of the adult kangaroo rat population can readily be\r\nmade, simply by counting the mounds. Such a census affords at least a\r\nconservative estimate of the number of adult individuals occupying a\r\ngiven area.\r\n\r\nThe first estimates of abundance on the Range Reserve were from actual\r\ncounts of dens on areas measured off for experimental fencing, and gave\r\nthe figure of about two mounds to the acre. From time to time rough\r\nestimates were made on different portions of the pastures, and these\r\nchecked well with the above. Later still, a careful count showed 300\r\nmounds on approximately 160 acres (see p. 8), or 1.87 mounds per acre.\r\nNine areas of 2 acres each, representing different environmental\r\nconditions, were later selected in different portions of the Range\r\nReserve, and the dens accurately counted. The number of dens per 2 acres\r\nvaried from none to a maximum infestation of 12, neither extreme\r\noccurring over large areas. The total number of dens was found to be 43\r\non the 18 acres, or an average of 2.38 dens per acre.\r\n\r\nFrom all these estimates it may fairly be concluded that two mounds, or\r\ntwo animals, per acre is a conservative estimate for the infestation of\r\nthe entire Range Reserve, with the possible exception of small areas at\r\nits upper edges, where the altitude limit of _spectabilis_ is passed. It\r\nis, however, impossible to estimate the area of the State infested with\r\nkangaroo rats, for some large stretches of fine grassland show no\r\nkangaroo rats whatever, while others have more than are present on the\r\nreserve; and we have no estimates of the extent of either type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May, 1894, Fisher found a ranchman at Willcox, Ariz., who complained\r\nmore bitterly of the depredations of _spectabilis_ than of those of any\r\nother mammal.\r\n\r\nOn the United States Range Reserve the food material appropriated by the\r\nkangaroo rat during good years is inappreciable. There is such an excess\r\nof forage grass produced that all the rodents together make very little\r\ndifference. But with the periodic recurrence of lean years, when drought\r\nconditions are such that little or no grass grows, the effects of rodent\r\ndamage not only become apparent, but may be a critical factor\r\ndetermining whether a given number of domestic animals can be grazed on\r\nthe area (Pl. VIII, Fig. 2).\r\n\r\nWith two kangaroo rats to the acre (1,280 per square mile), there would\r\nbe 64,000 animals on the 50 square miles of the Range Reserve. If each\r\nrat stores 4 pounds of grass seeds and crowns and other edible forage\r\nduring the season (and in severe seasons we find that more crowns are\r\nstored than under ordinary conditions), a total of 256,000 pounds, or\r\n128 tons, of edible forage are rendered unavailable to stock. In dry\r\nyears it is probable that this amount of forage would be of critical\r\nimportance. Allowing 50 pounds of food a day for each steer, the forage\r\ndestroyed would be sufficient to provide for the needs of one steer for\r\n5,120 days, or for the needs of 14 steers for one year. On a stock ranch\r\nthe size of the Range Reserve this might mean the difference between\r\nsuccess and failure.\r\n\r\nIt seems not unlikely, therefore, that during seasons of drought the\r\nbanner-tailed kangaroo rat, where it is abundant on the grazing ranges\r\nof the Southwest, may be a factor of critical importance in relation to\r\nforage production and carrying capacity. It must be remembered,\r\nmoreover, that the stored material consists largely of seeds, so that\r\nthis loss is of greater importance than would be the case were it\r\nordinary forage. Some of the range grasses of this region found in\r\ngreatest quantity in the stored material depend in large part, under\r\ncertain conditions, upon seed reproduction. Rehabilitation of a depleted\r\nrange after severe drought and consequent close grazing and trampling is\r\nretarded by the heavy toll of seed taken by the kangaroo rats.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTROL.\r\n\r\nKangaroo rats may be easily eradicated by the use of the poisoned grain\r\nused for prairie-dog control by the Biological Survey and the University\r\nof Arizona Extension Service. This can be obtained by application to the\r\nState representative of the Biological Survey or to the local county\r\nagricultural agent, or may be mixed as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Formula for poisoned bait._--Dissolve 1 ounce of strychnine\r\n     sulphate in 1-1/2 pints of boiling water. Add 1 heaping\r\n     tablespoonful of gloss starch, previously mixed with a little cold\r\n     water, and boil until a clear paste is formed. Add 1 ounce of\r\n     baking soda and stir to a creamy mass. Add 1/2 ounce of glycerine\r\n     and 1/4 pint of corn sirup and stir thoroughly. Pour over 16 quarts\r\n     of rolled barley and mix well until every grain is evenly coated.\r\n     Allow to dry before using.\r\n\r\n     In bushel quantities use as above directed, 2 ounces of strychnine,\r\n     2 ounces of soda, 1 ounce of glycerin, 1-1/4 ounces of starch,\r\n     1-1/2 quarts of boiling water, and 5/8 pint of corn sirup.\r\n\r\n     Scatter poison, when the natural food of the kangaroo rat is\r\n     scarce, on clean hard places near the holes, 1 quart to 50 holes.\r\n\r\n     If powdered strychnine alkaloid is used, prepare the hot starch\r\n     paste first. Then sift strychnine and baking soda, previously\r\n     thoroughly mixed, into the hot starch paste and stir to a creamy\r\n     mass. Proceed as in the above directions with sirup, glycerin,\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\n     Use this poison within five days after mixing or retain in\r\n     air-tight containers.\r\n\r\n     _Caution._--All poison containers and all utensils used in the\r\n     preparation of poison should be kept _plainly labeled_ and _out of\r\n     reach of children_, irresponsible persons, and live stock.\r\n\r\n     A spoonful of the poisoned grain scattered about the used entrances\r\n     of a mound is sufficient, and prebaiting is not necessary, as with\r\n     prairie dogs.\r\n\r\nA word of caution should perhaps be offered in connection with control\r\nmeasures. As man has come to occupy a greater portion of the earth's\r\nsurface, and as he has become more and more the master of his\r\nenvironment, he has inevitably disturbed the relationships of the birds\r\nand mammals about him, has upset the balance of nature. If he kills the\r\ncarnivorous species because of their depredations on game and live stock\r\nhe must be prepared to cope with the increased hordes of rodents which\r\nfeed on vegetation and on which the carnivorous animals act as a check.\r\nIf he destroys the rodents, he may remove the checks on certain noxious\r\nplants or insects. One control measure often necessitates the adoption\r\nof another.\r\n\r\nThis is not to argue against control measures, for if our harmful\r\nspecies were not controlled, agriculture in many sections would be\r\nimpossible. Control measures, however, should be scientifically founded\r\nand applied. The indiscriminate slaughter of supposedly harmful species\r\nof birds and mammals in the guise of benefiting agriculture may do far\r\nmore harm than good. Many of the species which do some harm do far more\r\ngood. The exact status of each suspected species should be carefully\r\ndetermined through an adequate scientific investigation. If the species\r\nis condemned, sound control measures should be thoroughly applied.\r\n\r\nIn grazing districts or in areas devoted to intensive agriculture the\r\ndeath sentence should probably be passed on the banner-tailed kangaroo\r\nrat. It should be recalled, however, that this is the largest and one of\r\nthe handsomest of all its family, and that it is one of the most\r\ncharacteristic and interesting of all the desert fauna; where extensive\r\ngrazing or agricultural operations are not undertaken, therefore, we\r\nfeel that the kangaroo rat should be let alone, unless its presence\r\nthreatens infestation of valuable agricultural or grazing lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Kangaroo rats may be separated with ease from all other mammals; the\r\nlong tail and short and weak fore feet separate them from the pocket\r\ngophers; the white hip-stripe distinguishes them from the pocket mice.\r\nThe decidedly larger size and the white-tipped tail separate _Dipodomys\r\nspectabilis spectabilis_ and _D. deserti_ from _D._ _merriami_ and _D.\r\nordii_. The darker color and vividly contrasted black-and-white tail of\r\n_spectabilis_ distinguish it from _deserti_.\r\n\r\n(2) _Dipodomys s. spectabilis_ occurs in the open arid country of\r\nportions of the Lower and Upper Sonoran Zones of Arizona, New Mexico,\r\nTexas, Sonora, and Chihuahua. It lives in harder soil than does\r\n_deserti_, and builds more conspicuous mounds.\r\n\r\n(3) There is no evidence of intergradation or hybridization between\r\n_spectabilis_ and _deserti_.\r\n\r\n(4) _Dipodomys s. spectabilis_ is nocturnal; it is gentle, and does not\r\noffer to bite when taken in the hand; is silent for the most part;\r\nactive; somewhat sociable with its fellows, but fights in defense of its\r\nfood stores; progresses chiefly by leaping; signals by a drumming or\r\ntapping on the ground with its hind feet.\r\n\r\n(5) The breeding season of _spectabilis_ begins in January and continues\r\ninto August. Whether more than one litter is raised in a single season\r\nis unknown. The number of young in each litter varies from 1 to 3,\r\naveraging 2.\r\n\r\n(6) _Dipodomys s. spectabilis_ does not hibernate, but provides food\r\nstores, mostly seeds, for use during seasons when food would be\r\notherwise unavailable. Storage in each den varies in quantity from 5\r\ngrams (about 1/6 ounce) to 5,750 grams (12.67 pounds). Materials stored\r\ninclude several important forage plants; for example, various species of\r\n_Bouteloua_ and _Aristida_, with _B. rothrockii_ (crowfoot grama) the\r\nmost important. Accessibility and abundance of different plants have\r\nmuch to do with the kinds of storage found.\r\n\r\n(7) The dens of _spectabilis_ are the most notable of all kangaroo rat\r\ndwelling places. They range from 6 inches to 4 feet in vertical height,\r\nand from 5 to 15 feet in diameter. Here the kangaroo rat has its home,\r\nshelter, and food-storage chambers. Within the den is found a tortuous\r\nnetwork of burrows, with many storage and some nest chambers, the whole\r\narranged so as to be two to four stories high.\r\n\r\n(8) _Dipodomys s. spectabilis_ is not of great economic significance,\r\nexcept locally, in ordinary seasons. During periods of extreme drought\r\nit may be of critical importance on grazing areas from the standpoint of\r\nthe carrying capacity of the range.\r\n\r\n(9) Kangaroo rats are easy to poison by following the same formula as\r\nthat used by the Biological Survey for destroying prairie dogs.\r\n\r\n(10) In many places unsuited to extensive grazing or agriculture\r\n_spectabilis_ does no appreciable damage. It is one of the most\r\ninteresting of all the rodents peculiar to our Southwestern deserts, and\r\nshould not be molested except where it is destructive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nALLEN, J.
